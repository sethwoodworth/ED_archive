If you were to search for everything that was unholy and wrong with the video game community on the internet in this day and age, one could do no worse than to look at '''ScrewAttack''', ''A.K.A Craig Skistimas' house of child slave labor, bullying and bridge burning.''   

While they were regarded as [[lie|cool]] for their "underdog" status back in the day, ScrewAttack is really best known nowadays as not only the evil master who pulls the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]]'s choke collar, but more recently for their god-awful corporate mismanagement, terrible public relations & persona, [[butthurt|immature tantrums]] against rival websites (issuing pathetic shallow [[eLawyer]] threats) and inhuman "bullying" treatment of their own staff. 

They may try their hardest to make it look like they're being cool by standing up for their common man against the Goliath that is the video gaming industry, but do not be fooled - they are just as much the evil corporate, dark, money grabbing douche-bags that will let no-one stand in their way as the big faceless publishers they oppose. They care no more for you than Hitler did of the Jews. One mistake from you or [[DO IT FAGGOT|dare you even go to another website]] as you're bored of their uninspired videos, it's off to the gas chamber with you my friend, with Craig himself dumping in the Zyklon B.  

[[TL;DR]] ScrewAttack is truly a disgusting company.


== Beginnings ==
[[Image:Tomncraig.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stuttering Craig & Handsome Tom. The masterminds behind ScrewAttack.]]
ScrewAttack was shat out of Stuttering Craig's [[Poland|Polak]] cum stained [[vagina|Mangina]] one chilly spring morning in 2006, when he decided to pair up with Handsome Tom Hanley to make an shitty podcast about how cool retro video games are. In all fairness, back in 2006, this was a novel idea (with only the likes of [[Seanbaby|SeanBaby]] and [[Video_Game_Reviewers/List_of_Reviewers#ConsoleVania_.2F_VideoGaiden|ConsoleVania]] having done it before). But Craig sadly knows as much information about video games as the [[Irate Gamer]] does, forcing Tom  to cover his back with even the most basic of schoolboy errors. Thus, with their boring, sleep-inducing dialogue and ill-informed gaming facts, the website and podcast was quickly falling into obscurity before it had even started. Something HAD to be done...


=== GameLife, the Beta AVGN ===
[[File:Andrew-tn.jpg|thumb|left|Andrew Rosenbaum,  the Beta AVGN.]]
[[Image:AVGN ass.gif|thumb|right|200px|The answer to what everyone thinks about their site.]]
Come that Summer, Craig noticed how popular a group of (literally) retarded [[video game reviewers]] by the name of [[GameLife]] had become on the web. They were becoming THE big video game video makers on [[YouTube]] and [[MTV]] had even offered them their own TV show. So seeing Jew, Craig jumped at the chance at working with them to make epic monies. This video especially shows how desperate ScrewAttack wanted to suck up to these 'tards...

<center>{{frame|<youtube>YsxSGRmgAcY</youtube>|color=#605175}}</center>


Fortunately, as retarded as GameLife were,  they at least had the mental brain capacity and foresight to tell Craig to go fuck himself. 

So, desperate to leech off someone else's eFame, he looked around the internets for some other <s>naive fool</s> video gaming reviewing candidate. By some total luck, he noticed a fresh faced young man on [[YouTube]] by the name of [[AVGN|James Rolfe]] who was becoming increasingly popular by his videos of saying "fuck" and "shit" to various NES games. This was Craig's second big chance at riding the gravy train to internet celebrity. James foolishly signed a contract which gave ScrewAttack full rights of his show and weekly rectal drilling rights. Craig has been riding James' shirt tails of eFame ever since, never letting go for anything.

== The Site Itself ==
[[Image:Screwattackoldwebsite.jpg|thumb|right|200px|ScrewAttack, Circa 2007.<br><br>These were the days when they put effort into making all the video content for their own site, instead of demanding [[you]] do it instead.]]
Oh dear, where to begin.... When the site first launched it looked like a convoluted mess of hastily thrown together icons and stolen .gifs of copyrighted material [[ScrewAttack#ScrewAttack_and_Copyright_Infringement|(more on that below)]]. After a year Stuttering Craig decided to [[ADHD|change the site design]] to something that was still eye rape, albeit to a lesser extent. '''A year later''' he changed it again, this time to something that, well, let's just say that the Nerd used his feelings toward the site as a guide to his [[Shit|hilarious]] analogies. It was redesigned to a broken pile of [[Web 2.0]] garbage; the main page didn't communicate with the forums, blog features were added in a vain attempt to one-up [[facebook]], commenting was added to videos so you didn't have to expose your idiocy via [[YouTube]] anymore, and the site would crash your browser every 30 seconds. While this may seem like a prime example of [[IRL trolling]] we're sorry to say it wasn't - it was just Craig trying to [[rape|help out]] <s>one of his friends</s> another dipshit who was hurting for money and obviously hadn't taken a single [[computer science]] elective.

=== Forums ===
Rivaling [[GameFAQs]] in their stupidity and surpassing [[That Guy With The Glasses]] in needless blind loyalty, the forums were your one-stop destination to stand in queue for your turn to suck on Craig's Jew cock. Had something bad to say about a staff member? THREAD LOCKED. Had something to say about the Nerd? THREAD LOCKED ''AND'' you got a warning. Heaven forbid you have some [[constructive criticism]] or didn't like a video... [[Baleet|THREAD DELETED]] and [[Spoony|you're treacherous ass is banned]]! While the admins didn't necessarily give a flying fuck, Craig had the brilliant decision to make the Nerd's number-one butt buddy black person one of the mods. This meant that any and all negative posts thrown toward their lord and savior James Rolfe were deleted and the user was banned, whilst Matei jerked off to the AVGN theme song.

When the front page was upgraded (and we use that term loosely) things got a bit hectic. The [[13 year old boy|junior]] trolls from GameTrailers started flooding in and Craig, along with the admins, told all the mods to apply liberal use of their trusty [[ban hammer|ban hammers]]. This led to a sort of civil war between the forum and blogs and a revolving door of mods, as many either called it quits or just stopped showing up. When the dust settled the forums were put under marshal law and posting halted for a week. Once Craig saw their bandwidth was dropping he told the mods who stuck around to call it quits, returning the forums to their previously [[stupid]] state. Still, they haven't quite recovered and most of the users' actions remained on the front page.

=== The Front Page ===
With the latest version of the site the ScrewAttack crew decided to add a slew of [[SNCA|new and exciting]] features to the front page, including:

* User profiles so you can share how many times you've jerked off to [[Metroid]]
* A buddy system so you can gaze at the countless waifus users use as their profile picks
* Fap to aforementioned waifus
* Upload your own crappy videos so Craig and Destin don't have to do any work and still get paid while you don't
* Post blogs about how no game will ever be as good as Ocarina of Time
* Post blogs asking what happened to Handsome Tom
* Post blogs saying how much you hate the forums/site/Craig and get banned
* Leave comments on videos just to tell Destin that [[Truth|he looks like a faggot]]
* Build up SA points to increase your level so others can know [[unwarranted self importance|how much more important your posts are than theirs]]

Needless to say many users saw through the Web 2.0 bullshit and abandoned the long-sinking ship. Those who have stayed behind are certifiably retarded and should all jump off a cliff ''en masse'' like the lemmings they are.

== ScrewAttack and Copyright Infringement ==
[[Image:Screwattacklogo3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The original logo. Nope looks nothing like Metroid's icon. Move along here.]]
[[Image:Avgndvd1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friday the 13th, TMNT, Castlevania, Space Invaders, and Back to the Future. Yep, I created all of these.]]

I know what [[you]] must be asking yourself: "ScrewAttack? Isn't that a special move in Metroid?" Why, yes it is! In their early years Mr. Skistimas had as much regard to Nintendo copyright infringement as [[Chris-chan]] does. Openly calling themselves "Screw (SPACE) Attack" and even having the nerve to steal the Screw Attack symbol as their logo. Fuck, if he names his cash cow The Angry NINTENDO Nerd, what chance did an obscure video game reference have? Unfortunately, when it came to registering said company, Craig learnt the hard way that for some unexplained reason, you can't copyright something that's already been copyrighted. ''No, not even if you remove the space Craig.'' Hence forth, they were to be called ScrewAttack Entertainment LLC.  

As for their store you'll notice that [http://www.screwattackstore.com/avgndvds.html they sell AVGN reviews on DVD.] Said reviews have been edited for copyright issues, so any licensed music or blockbuster movie footage is edited out. [[Fucktard |Too bad these are still under copyright by dozens of companies]]. Such companies fall under movies production, video games, comic book, fast food, and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkk9_2u_aSo beer manufacturers]. The other issue here for James is that the AVGN is a character of his, so he's not using these properties under fair use as far as being a reviewer goes. Said videos would have to just feature the AVGN talking to the camera without any other footage, logos, or music used. James and Craig better enjoy their cash now till a huge lawsuit destroys both ScrewAttack and Cinemassacre.

== Contributors ==

For every shitty gaming journalism site they need a team of untalented hacks to help make the site profitable. Too bad ScrewAttack is more of a pyramid scheme for workmanship. Everyone works underneath Stuttering Craig who consist of regular contributors to his easily replaceable interns. The only person that is allowed to see Craig eye to eye is AVGN since he's the driving force behind his weekly paycheck. Might as well work double time copy/pasting those articles from IGN. At the end of the day as long as Craig is in a good mood you'll keep your job. Otherwise he'll make you fuck off to [[That Guy With The Glasses]] and take orders from an angry [[Mexican]] about making the same content.

[[Image:Avgnmovierant.jpg|thumb|right|200px|James goes insane on somebody giving criticism for his shitty-movie idea (butthurt).]]

Make no argument about it, '''The Angry Video Game Nerd''' (aka James ROFL or PermaVirgin) is the umbilical cord of ScrewAttack, the cash-cow, the golden goose, call it what you will.  As soon as anything happens to this man ScrewAttack will shrivel up and die like the cancerous lump that they are.

James is a [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]], [[ADD|ADD-ridden]], nerdraged, [[shit | fecalphiliac]] [[furry]] who creates Gametrailers.com videos where he "reviews" bad [[video games]] and, extending to his Youtube account and SpikeTV, films. Instead of actually reviewing the games like a professional slapstick author (as we all know, video game reviewing is [[serious business]]), he just yells infantile cusswords (about at a 12-year-old's level) at his [[television]] screen. [[13-year-old boy|You]], the viewer, find this hilarious. Most of them roughly consist of off-key utterances from some shit-eating whacked out autistic chug, e.g. [[WTF|"What the fuck!"]] [[trying too hard|"What the fuckin' fuck!!"]] [[unfunny|"What a piece of fuck!"]]. 

At the end of a review, he repeatedly [[scat|talks about topics surrounding shit]], such as how he longs for the game to be over so he could milk a bull's asshole (or his own) inside out, take a shit on a game, or simply talk about shit itself. Because really, nothing is funnier than [[Family Guy|doing the same joke over and over again]].

He also takes a swig of a [[beer]] bottle every three seconds in his videos to prove to people that he's a [[pussy|man]], when really he's only trying to wash out the taste of [[your mom|cum]] from his mouth.

Angry Nintendo Nerd has officially changed his named to "Angry Video Game Nerd" so he wouldn't get sued by Nintendo for making shitty shirts with his catchphrases on them, thereby [[LINK_MAH_BOIIIII|associating "Nintendo"]] with this schizoid, liberal [[Beastiality|bullfuck]] phenomenon. It should be noted that regardless of this [[stupid|legal genius]], he still has an IQ dwarfed by that of the average [[4chan]] user's left [[Ball|testicle]]. Anyone who acts like a person with [[Tourette's Guy|Tourrette's]] for views on [[Youtube]] [[stupid|is]] [[retarded|anything]] [[unfunny|but]].  Any of his off the cuff videos show just how little screen presence he truly possesses. He has a fat wife and loves all those old terrible monster movies that you don't give a fuck about. He also puts on this weird air of reverence for a lot of stupid old shit that he didn't really like as a child. 

James Rolfe is the driving force behind ScrewAttack. Their site cannot survive without his contributions due to the amount of traffic, DVD sales, and ad revenue they receive. Without James their site could in fact crumble into it's own mediocrity. As of late 2010 James has slowed down the amount of AVGN videos he releases to once a month. It is evident in these videos that James is in fact tired of this entire routine and wants to quit, but can't due to the enormous fan base he's acquired from ScrewAttack. However as a last minute act of desperation [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZw6YHR2EBM he wants to make a movie] similar to [[TGWTG#Kickassia|Kickassia]].

AKA Handsome Tom 2.0, '''Destin Legarie''' (AKA '''Daily Destin''') is Craig's right hand man and personal [[Slave|house nigger]]. He was discovered by Stuttering Craig after claiming asylum in America, fleeing the third world country of [[Canada]]. Seeing potential and a large Handsome Tom shaped gap in his company, Craig took him under his wing to work on the site with his only payment being daily anal penetration.  

Destin is responsible for quite possibly the only thing worth watching on ScrewAttack, Hard News.

But even Destin has noticed the cracks in the crumbling Skistimas empire and is desperately trying to bail out of the sinking S.S. ScrewAttack [http://www.destinlegarie.com/?p=230 by joining Destructiod], (did he miss the TGWTG boat then?). But it can only be a matter of time before young Destin receives a patented Craig Co.(TM) knife in the back after he punishes this vile defector and traitor!

===='''THE BATTLE AT USACR RIDGE'''====

[[Last Thursday]], Corey was confronted for having [[gotis]] (as well as being a potential robot built by Craig to spew anything related to video games to impress nerds) in the Unofficial ScrewAttack Chat Room by [[lies | legit]] [[trap | girl gamer]] and [[troll]], Emily Gloom. Despite Corey's [[White Knights]] banning Emily Gloom for revealing that Corey in fact was [[truth | not a gamer, and just an attention-seeking prick-tease]], Gloomish supporters who were mods and admins of the chat at the time unbanned Emily Gloom over and over (who, as such, became more and more [[lulz | hostile]] towards Corey with each unbanning) until Corey, filled to the brim with [[baw | tears]] and [[butthurt]], logged out, [[an_hero | never to return to the chat room again]].

The aftermath of this event led to other ScrewAttack staff and interns [[butthurt | denying]] any further affiliation with the Unofficial Screwattack Chat Room, leaving the place to be run by [[nerds]] and [[fags]] until its eventual fall at the hands of trolls.

This historical event is [[lies | fondly]] remembered by [[gamers | people]] who were present at the time of Emily Gloom's [[epic_lulz | wrath]] against Corey, and is reenacted annually at 3:15 PM.

== Fallen Comrades from Stuttering Craig's Egotistical Wrath ==
 
=== Handsome Tom ===
[[Image:HandsomeTomImage.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Handsome Tom]]

'''''TL;DR REASON FOR DEPARTURE:'''  Got fucked over by his best friend over a lousy video game site.''

{{quote|Whatever happened to Handsome Tom?<br><br>I Miss Handsome Tom :(|90% of all ScrewAttack video comments on GameTrailers.com}}

Whilst Craig could be described as the "fun" side of ScrewAttack 2006 ''(aka "ScrewAttack: The Golden Years," aka "ScrewAttack: When it wasn't Such Shit Years")'', it was definitely Tom that was the brains behind the whole operation.  

Tom was the one to make sure all their [[you're doing it wrong|gaming facts were correct, their reviews accurate]] and foremost were interesting to watch. This change was most apparent as soon as he "left" the company, when their videos took a serious nosedive in quality after Craig realized he knew fuck all about video games and got his [[Mcdonalds|McJobbing]] teenage [[retard|fucktard]] workforce to write them up instead. (Which were on an accuracy level that would have made even the [[Irate Gamer]] [[I am disappoint|disappoint]].)

So how/why did Tom leave? Short answer: [[Pwned|He was cowardly knifed in the back by Stuttering Craig]]. Tom in his infinite wisdom, decided to take a vacation one spring morning in 2007 and whilst he was away Craig registered the company in his name only. Of course, Tom being a [[pussy|reasonable man]] decided, "well, I'll be a sport to Craig and become a paid employee." Unfortunately, paying people is Stuttering Craig's personal Kyrptonite and he told Tom to [[GTFO|Fuck off]]. Tom then went on to create [[An Hero|The Game Heroes]], and then moved onto [[That Guy With The Glasses|TGWTG]].

Of course, Craig hadn't expected a backlash from fans at betraying his best friend in such a dick move. Even going as far as [[Delete fucking everything|removing entire sub-sections]] about Tom's departure from the ScrewAttack article on [[TOW]]. But needless to say, the absence and dismissal of Tom has always been a huge port-wine stain on both Craig and ScrewAttack's reputation. Even to this day [[newfags]] always post "Where is Handsome Tom?" on nearly every single video ScrewAttack has made.

[[File:OfficePolitics.png|thumb|right|200px|Craig talks about how a business is ran and why Larry needs to let go. I salute the writer. This comment is small summary about why Craig is an idiot.]]
<small>Note: The following section has been written and prepared for you by [[That Guy With The Glasses#Guru Larry|Guru Larry]]. This section is '''Larry Approved!'''</small>

'''''TL;DR REASON FOR DEPARTURE:''' No fuckin' pay, No Work''

After the Angry Video Game Nerd left for GameTrailers,  it was [[Britain|Britfags]] Wesley Lock and Guru Larry (AKA ScrewAttackEurope) who had become the main draw for ScrewAttack. Their videos, which consisted of shitty shows like [[America|Games Yanks Can't Wank]], were pulling in more views than any of ScrewAttack's own efforts (which isn't that hard considering they had devolved into them kicking each other in the balls after Tom's "departure").

Unfortunately, Craig has as much foresight as Mr. Magoo when it comes to nurturing future talent, so just as he did with Awesome Video Games, Captain S, GameJew and a slew of their other content producers, he did nothing but ignore them and instead ride the coattails of the AVGN for all he's worth and feather his own nest.

This was half the problem though, For some reason, Larry & Wez didn't like the idea of making videos for free (or at least earn 10% of the ad revenue ScrewAttack was making off their videos when they moved over to Blip). So with Craig's reluctancy to also put ScrewAttack Europe on GameTrailers or other [[IGN|such sites]], Larry and Wez moved onto making shows for [[BBC|British TV]] and later on to [[TGWTG]]. Craig still didn't get the picture and instead branded them [[Irony|traitors]] for working on websites that [[USI|openly attack his]].

ScrewAttackEurope then began to slowly disappear off ScrewAttack's website, first the SAE section of their forums, then eventually off their main page. This was all done without ever informing Wez or Larry that they had been fired. But come August of 2010, Craig was informed that they were making money on YouTube as they had recently become partners. Seeing red, Craig threw a bitch fit, and went [[Spax3]] on their asses, demanding Wez and Larry close their account because of bogus [[ScrewAttack#Copyright_Infringement|"copyright infringement"]] claims, followed by wild accusations of them only becoming partners in the first place as they were illegitimately using ScrewAttack's name. Craig then BAWWWED to YouTube and demanded that they remove their partnership status.

Of course, he threw such a massive eTantrum this time, it caught the attention of fans, who saw this as "Stuttering Craig Vs. Handsome Tom" all over again. In response Craig released a lulzworthy video explaining what mean and nasty persons Larry and Wez were for leaving their website (note: never explaining '''"why"''' they left), whilst Destin completely ruined any discernible respect they could have ascertained from said video by acting like a [[13 year old boy|total Child]]. 

Larry and Wez now make the same old shit videos for TGWTG and a number of [[Machinima.com|other websites]]. OH SHITS! [[Spax3|NAUW HEZ ON SPAXS SITE!!1!!1]] With Wez even causing his own eDrama a few months prior, by belittling a [[slut|mother]] who openly admits to playing Xbox Live more than looking after her baby, then threatening to sue Wez for making a commentary about it.

=== 8-Bit Mickey ===
[[Image:8bitmickey.jpg|thumb|left|200px|8-Bit Mickey]]

'''''TL;DR REASON FOR DEPARTURE:''' Screwed off his intern gig to suck Tom's cock.''

8-Bit Mickey is best described nowadays as the "Daily Destin" of The Game Heroes (Tom's version of ScrewAttack), He is Tom's [[bitch|sidekick/lackey]] and the only recognizable face amongst Tom's legion of staff, so it's nice to see Tom is still keeping up the ScrewAttack tradition of hiring people no-one knows.   

But like Tom, Mickey also started out on ScrewAttack during their Golden Age and making semi-decent video game related content, but he was always on Tom's side of the fence when it came to working there. So when the ScrewAttack Split occurred, Mickey was torn between remaining loyal to his friend  or staying on a non-paying job with an egotistical Polish douche-bag. Needless to say, he made the <s>right</s> better decision.

Mickey has even gone on to make an eCelebrity status of his own, by becoming a contestant in the second season of "The Tester," where overweight basement dwellers and fap-material who clearly know Jack shit about gaming compete against each other for a minimum wage job testing shitty PS3 titles. This may sound bad to a normal human being, but after failing out of college and having to resort to working at ScrewAttack, Mickey must feel like a multi-million dollar earning prostitute inspector!

SPOILER: He got booted out after episode 4 as his podgy, basement dwelling posture stopped him for even the most basic of physical exercise.

=== Captain S (PBC Productions) ===

[[File:Captain S.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Captain S (PBC Productions)]]

'''''TL;DR REASON FOR DEPARTURE:''' Refused to make a hideously expensive show for free and then fired for joining TGWTG.''

Captain S was ScrewAttack's first (and somewhat successful) attempt at making a video game series that didn't strictly evolve around reviews.  Even though it was a blatant rip-off of the 80's cartoon series, Captain N: The Game Master.

Unfortunately, it was once again the Achilles heel of Stuttering Craig that put the show to an end,  [[Money]].  In order to make a second season (and because they were screwed into a hand-cuffs "exclusivity" contract) the only option was to become like Oliver Twist and ask the Stuttering one for an investment.  Craig, of course blew his top and demanded they somehow make the show for free.  Which to any sane human being is impossible, so rather than endure a regular grilling from ScrewAttack ''"is the show ready?" "where is the show?" "we need the show up today!"'',  PBC decided to become [[an hero]] and disband the entire company.

They did find solace (and piss off Craig in the process) by creating [[Tgwtg#Little_Miss_Gamer.2FPBC_Productions|Little Miss Gamer]] for TGWTG. A show about a strange [[Jewish]] [[Lord of the Rings|Smeagol-like]] creature that reviews video games and eBegs for consoles and handhelds that they'll never use or could easily afford.

Underbelly, not to be confused with the awful Australian show [[Underbelly]], is made in the USA by real Americans, not Aussie douche-bags. [http://www.youtube.com/underbellyshow Underbelly] was recently a partnered show with ScrewAttack. They boasted some of the highest production values ScrewAttack has ever seen, using a white screen and shooting all in HD. They are a clear mix between [http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/home.do Penn & Teller's Bullshit] and [http://g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/index.aspx Attack of the Show] offering what they call "infotainment" to the interwebs.

The show has five core members and about ten hanger-on's that occasionally host or act in a variety of episodes. Their videos vary in style ranging from psuedo-documentary white screen segments, to comedic parody skits, to showing rare gameplay footage. They also cover conventions as press and host their own local events.

They are friends with brentalfoss and have visited the AVGN several times to check out his collection and chat about his "movie." They also got on the good side of Public Relation companies like [http://www.golinharris.com/ GolinHarris] and [http://www.bhimpact.com/ Bender/Helper Impact], allowing them access to gaming events, conventions, and interviews most shows couldn't dream of getting. They recently met Hideo Kojima, Shigeru Miyamoto, and [[Reggie Fils-Aime]] who, for some reason, did not kill them instantly.

They were added to ScrewAttack's Partner Shows list in early 2010, but the partnership was very one-sided as there was never any compensation and the contract Underbelly would've had to sign gave Craig full rights to the show.  The creators, [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3447495/ Justin Silverman] and [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3115807/ Shawn Caple], having worked in the real video industry were cautious about this and after a Skype meeting with Craig decided to seek out a more stable host. They are currently only uploading to YouTube and partnered with [http://www.youtube.com/user/vsauce Vsauce] (a YouTube gaming channel under [http://www.nextnewnetworks.com/ Next New Network's] flagship.)
