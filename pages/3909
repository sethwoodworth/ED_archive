==Background==

'''TED''' started in 1984 as a conference for people from three worlds: [[faggots|Technology, Entertainment, Design]] (T.E.D. gedit?). Since then [[nobody cares|its scope has become ever broader]]. Along with the annual [[gangbang|TED Conference]] and the [[bukake|TEDGlobal conference]], '''TED''' includes the [[prize|award-winning]] '''TEDTalks''' video site, the '''Open Translation Program''', the new '''TEDx''' community program, this year's '''TEDIndia Conference''' and the annual [[buttsecks|TED Prize]].

Being a small, dyslexic nonprofit <s>devoted to</s> devoid of [[snca|Ideas Worth Spreading]], who better to ask for a keynote speech than [[m00t]].

After being invited to speak at the [http://conferences.ted.com/TED2010/ TED2010 Conference] in February 2010 during the "[[Provocation]]" session, [[moot]] took to the stage after an awkward introduction. He revealed that [[4chan]] produces [[9000|700,000 posts]] a day, from 7 million unique users and went on to bore all concerned explaining shit like [[Rickrolling]], [[Rule 34]] and [[Dusty the Cat]].

==The Meme==

When asked if "[[the Gibson|the TED website]] would be hacked now" during the Q&A session, [[moot]] responded '''"You're lucky this isn't being streamed to them live right now."'''  When it was pointed out that there <i><b>was</b></i> a stream to be had, his response of '''"I hope nobody has hacked the stream"''' was ossified into meme status by salivating [[fanboi]]s.

As the average intelligence of the typical [[4chan]]fag is below state minimums for even Texan retards, this unlulzy banter has been dubbed 'a new [[meme]]'.  It is, however, [[forced meme|dead on arrival]].

As almost [[noone]] had the initial stream, and the access that ''did'' exist was "strung together like a christmas tree", most links consisted of [[rickrolls]] and [[Pokemon]] theme songs.  This lead many [[newfag]]s to believe that the whole thing was an elaborate [[troll]].  However, there are screencaps, which prove that it's [[shooped|totally legit]].
