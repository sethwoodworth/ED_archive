[[Image:Billionsandbillions.jpg|center|thumb|600px|As if you needed anymore proof [[God]] isn't real: this man had to die, and yet [[Jersey Shore|Mike the Situation]] is alive and well. [[Truth|How the fuck is that fair?]] ]]
'''Carl Sagan''', easily one of the [[great|greatest]] men who ever lived, was the inventor of the [[Fake and Gay|totally made-up number]] "billions and billions", and is famous for making really basic scientific concepts easier for [[stoner|stoners]] to understand. Despite being totally damn [[awesome]], Sagan's legacy has been tainted because of his association with [[atheism]], and because many [[Conservative]] fucktards remember him as being Reagan's mortal nemesis, apparently thinking Sagan's theory of "nuclear winter" is the same thing as "[[global warming]]".

In addition to his litany of ceaselessly [[circlejerk|badass]] accomplishments, Sagan is best remembered for maybe being the only person who made labeled a [[geek]] a badge of honour, in addition to making [[science]] not suck, and for proving that you don't need to actually contribute anything to science if you want to be renowned as a genius by pot-smokers everywhere.
