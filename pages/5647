[[Jew|
'''Natalie Portman''']] is a snooty [[Israeli]]-American [[Jewess]] with [[Jewish|tiny]] [[tits]]. Despite her [[At least 100 years ago|present popularity]], she becomes less suitable as a [[fap]] target [[Period|by the month]].

== Biography ==
Natalie Portman was born in the [[Israel|land of the terrorists]] like over 25 years ago or something. Like the typical Jewish celebrity, Portman claims that her [[Old people|grandparents]] [[Lollercaust|died in Auschwitz]]. Her real last name is the horrifyingly Jewish ''Hershlag'', but she changed it to the upstanding [[British]] name ''Portman'' in an attempt to keep people from accidentally [[vomit]]ing every time they tried to pronounce her last name. She was discovered in a pizza parlor at the age of 12 by a [[pedophile]] who claimed he was a [[model]] scout. For the next several years, she starred in a shitload of [[child porn|movies and [[Molestation|got an education]].

Natalie epitomizes the typical Jew: neither she nor her family are [[Religion|religious]] and she claims to not believe in an afterlife [[Atheism|or God]]. At the same time, she's enjoying life as one of God's "[[Asking for it|chosen]]". She went to Jewish private schools, says she wants to live the rest of her life in Israel, wants to raise her kids Jewish, etc. 

Like [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], Natalie has been a [[vegetarian]] since childhood. Sadly, the lack of exposure to [[Semen#Nutritional Facts|essential nutrients]] from [[Niggerdick|hormonally treated meat]] has left her with [[Fail|tiny, shriveled breasts that resemble raisins]].

== Natalie Portman's Filmography ==
* ''Léon'' (aka ''The Professional'') is an [[awesome]] [[French]] movie which was used as wank material for [[pedophiles]].
* ''Heat'' is a movie that [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody watched]], probably because it sucked despite having [[Guido|Al Pacino and Rober De Niro]] as its main stars.
* ''Beautiful Girls'' is a movie where she was underage and had a sexual relationship with a 40 year old man. This movie is not available to rent in the USA [[censorship|for some reason]].
* ''Mars Attacks'' is a gay [[liberal]] movie in which she made out with a [[retard]] because [[alien]]s had killed everyone else.
* She then proceeded to tarnish her promising career by starring in a trilogy of [[Star Wars|stupid movies]] directed by [[George Lucas|a guy without a fucking neck]].
* ''Closer'' is the movie where she [[cosplays]] as Stephanie from [[Lazy Town]].
* ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' is a crappy film about a [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|severely burnt]] [[anarchist]] revolutionary who hides behind a mask. Portman starred in this movie as his bald [[prison]] bitch. The directors – the same dicks who made ''[[The Matrix]]'' – watered down the fact that he's an anarchist fighting against a Fascist government and made him a vague "freedom fighter". American audiences interpreted this as his being a [[liberal]] standing up against the forces of neoconservatism which  pissed off the creator of the graphic novel series and made [[anarchist]] groups cry. Portman said she wanted the role in ''V for Vendetta'' because her character (and this is a real quote) "...[is] often bad and does things that you don't like... Being from Israel was a reason [she] wanted to do this because terrorism and violence are such a daily part of [her] conversations."

* ''[[Aids|Black]] Swan'' is a grossly overhyped, overrated piece of shit, that truly confirms how [[insane|fucking mental]] Hollywood is.  [[Srsly|Seriously]], a film about fucking ballet?  Sounding like it was written by a child, it was clearly only created to milk money from a [[16-year-old girl|key movie going demographic]].  Portman gets nominated for an Oscar on the basis of looking like she's constantly trying to crap from her mouth.  [[Nathaniel|Aronofsky]] tries miserably to hide the film's many flaws behind the [[Fail|plot device]] that Portman is [[u mad|crazy]].  Total [[Bullshit|bullshit]].

== Myths and Facts about Natalie Portman ==
''Myth – Natalie Portman knows politics''

''Fact – Natalie Portman is a Jew''

''Fact – Natalie Portman prefers [[Nerd|intelligence]] over [[Celebrity|movie star]]''

: In a further attempt to swerve attention from her money and power hungry Jewishness, Natalie stated "[[Fucktard|I don't care if college ruins my career]]. [[What|I'd rather be smart than a movie star]]" in an interview with [[Faux News]].
