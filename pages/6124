== '''History''' ==
First said on the cartoon show ''Mission Hill'', the phrase spread through the net as a comeback to an insult. Typing this in a fag forum will create much [[drama]] when said penis is not delivered.

Bob: [[GTFO]]

Steve: PENIS PENIS PENIS

The insulter gets so flustered that he has to [[rant_about_cons|rant]] and [[bitch]], therefore his [[opinion]] is no longer valid. Game over.

The most famous macro used of [[Penis]] x3 is a picture of cookie monster, from Sesame street, yelling at another puppet [[homo|Bert]].
