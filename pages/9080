Will verb again!
'''Will ''verb'' again''' is [[Netspeak]] for emphatically stating that you would do something great again. Originates from the style of [[eBay]] feedback.  Typically prefixed with "Top seller," no matter what the subject is.

Also can take the subjunctive form of ''would'' rather than ''will''. 

Examples:
* "Top seller. [[A Plus|A+++]] oral sex. will fuck again"
* "total tard. Top seller. will flame again"
* "Top seller. real [[girlvinyl]]!! will hit on again[[oneoneone|!!!111]]"
* "[[hepkitten]] came as described, Top seller. will use as end table again"
* "[[Prime-radiant]] came crazy as expected. Top seller. Will use as [[lol-cow]] again."
* "Top seller. [[Nigras]] came in fine condition (also, servitude) within two days of purchase. Civil war followed shortly after. Very high quality. The south will rise again."
* "Instead of lab [[chair]], package contained [http://xkcd.com/325/ live bobcat]. Would not buy again."
* "Top ho. Will [[IM PRESSIN CHARGES|press charges]] again."
