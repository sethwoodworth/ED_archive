'''Lexi Bee''' ([[Powerword]]: Alexis Leigh Byrd) is the pseudonym of a [[YouTube]] super-[[whore]] that has gained her shameless popularity by walking down the same path of [[Lady Gaga]]. Lexi has proven that the color pink, [[♥|hearts]] and unicorns make a dangerous combination and is another form of [[AIDS]] that slowly and painfully kills the [[internet]]. She strangely resembles a less funny version of a clown, or Marilyn Manson. With her five pounds of make up, huge wig, oversize eyebrows and her Jew, she is ready to tell the [[world]] to give her all the attention she wants.

Lexi has stained the [[internet]] by boasting her fetish for the color pink. She displays her affection for the color by collecting pink items, wearing pink clothes and even living in a pink room. Of course this is none other than something to [[Attention Whore|catch popularity]] from her dear [[YouTube]] users.

{{squote|Such a long story! I'll try and shorten it up a bit. Well I've been around on Myspace working my way up for at least 4 years. I started out "whoring" because it was a really, really big thing back then, and some how I made my way into the palms of other really popular Myspace kids and they helped me out.|Lexi|color= #FF3399}}

Lexi first entered the bowels of the internet on [[MySpace]], also known as the caveman’s [[Facebook]]. The very first thing Lexi has done was whoring herself to all the "big" users to give her some popularity since [[MySpace]] was extremely popular back then. Afterward, when she got bored, she began modeling her ugly shit and made a new path to her destination of being a true [[attention whore]]. During her modeling days, Lexi began to transform into this annoying entity known to be extremely loud and [[Sonichu|autistic]]. 

Like how a black person stands out in a crowd full of pure [[white people]], Lexi has shown to be a unique flower due to her ridiculous taste in fashion. Every single thing in her life completely shrouded by a deadly miasma of pink [[G.R.I.D.S.|mist]].. In fact, finding anything that isn’t pink within the videos shot in her room is about as hard as laughing at the typical [[Unfunny|Uncyclopedia joke]].

Her fashion is comparable to the [[Japanese]] fashion known as "[http://www.mookychick.co.uk/style/decora.php decora]". Basically, decora fashion consists of wearing anything that makes you feel young and fun; pink being an important color. Decora fashion also consists of wearing a number of layers, carrying brand names like Hello Kitty or [[Pokémon]], and being buried under glitter, accessories and [[plastic crap]].

==<span style="color: #ff1188">~*Her Videos*~</span>==

Another thing that highlights her [[AIDS]] on the [[internet]] is her [[YouTube]] account. Her [[YouTube]] videos demonstrate her wacky [[Buttsecks|adventures]], her ugly clothes and her equally [[Sonichu|autistic]] friends engaging in a clusterfuck of [[stupidity]]. These videos are also the common subject of a game on [[/b/]]. [[The game]] would be to not [[rage]] one bit while watching her videos. As of now, it is unknown if there even a single [[/b/tard]] that hasn’t raged at her videos.

[[File:LexiFan.jpg|thumb|left|A Lexi Bee [[fangirl]].]]

{{squote|Quit "@ing" Lexi, the whole fucking word already knows about her.|color= #FF3399}}

Believe it or not, [[Srsly|Lexi Bee actually has a fan base]] because of her horrible videos. Now, as expected, these fans are [[fat]], [[retarded]] fashion misfits. The common traits of her [[fanbase]] includes:

* Wannabe Fashion Designers
* Rejected Models
* [[Fat]] girls
* [[Fat]] girls rejected to be Models
* [[Weeaboos]]
* [[16-year-old girls]]

[[File:Lexi_MyLittlePony.PNG|thumb|Cori Shea, totally not Lexi Bee at all.]]

Don’t you even dare criticize any of Lexi’s wonderful doing! In her fans' eyes, you are a jealous and evil person for even thinking that Lexi isn’t as great as she seems for a single second. However, for the sake of lulz, feel free to criticize any and all of Lexi's cancerous videos and her malignant tumor followers. In the fans' eyes, you are a jealous and evil person, but that's [[shit nobody cares about]]. 

{{squote|There is no reason to do an "article" about her. Are you that jelaous/obsessed? I see you used some of the things i said on there.|color= #FF3399}}

A well-known enemy that is despised by Lexi’s [[fanbase]] is... well, a Lexi fan. That’s right; Cori Shea is someone who looks exactly like Lexi by imitating her fashion style, hair and love of pink which has inevitably [[trolled]] the Lexi [[fanbase]].

==<span style="color: #ff1188">~*Quotes*~</span>==
[[File:LexiBee_Twitter.PNG|thumb|Only a screen shot of her [[Twitter]].]]

Lexi also translates her annoying love for pink and all things [[kawaii]] through text. Why not submit that text on – oh say… [[Twitter]]! That’s right! Lexi has what is considered to be the most awful layout design in [[Twitter]] history. As expected, everything on the goddamn page is fucking pink making things harder to see with such a poorly made color scheme. What are even worse are the tweets themselves. Every tweet is riddled with stars, [[tilde]]s, [[emoticon]]s and [[hearts]]; making the text ever more difficult to depict.

But if that isn't enough, just go and visit {{twitter|jealousykills}}, a twitter dedicated to [[white knighting]] Lexi and replying to every. single. non-Lexi-loving. post.
