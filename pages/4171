Jack Bauer
[[Jack Bauer]] is a [[Jacknstock]] sockpuppet who stars in the [[old media]] show "''24''", where like all Jacknstock sockpuppets he permabans everyone for no reason. A typical ban reason would be as follows:

 02:11 ::: JB set mode +b mohammed!prophet@jihad.alqaeda.gov
 02:11 ::: mohammed was kicked from #rl by JB [sand nigger]

[[Image:Wtc_24_911.JPG|thumb|OH SHI-]] Every season of 24, Bauer goes on a stupid twenty-four hour rampage of fail, banning hundreds of users and blanking many cities into rubble.

'''Jack Bauer Facts''' is one of the most popular rip-offs of [[Chuck Norris|Chuck Norris facts]], and share many similarities, most notably a severe lack of [[lulz]].

Jack Bauer is in fact a modified copy of [[Chuck Norris]], both of who were [[Tony Stark|built by Tony Stark in a cave with a box of scraps]].

Actor '''Kiefer Sutherland''' portrays Jack Bauer, and let me tell you, he's one wild and craaaazy drunk.
