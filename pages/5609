'''''MST3K''''' for you [[fanboy]]-types; '''''Mystery Science Theatre 3000''''' for you [[England|English]]-types) was the greatest [[television]] show [[evar]], widely regarded as the forerunner of modern-day [[troll]]ing. First aired [[at least 100 years ago]] in a time before the mighty abundant internet. The show is the only real export of [[Minnesota]], a state otherwise known for shitty football teams, tons of snow, and ''Rocky and Bullwinkle''. The show retains coolness as <del> one of the few cult classics </del> the last of the cult classics to be assraped by [[Hot Topic]].

===PLOT===
In the not-too-distant future, Joel's superiors Dr. Forrester and Dr. Erhardt at the Gizmonic Institute decided he was a [[fag]] and stuck him aboard the Satellite of Love to be shot into space, where they would send him the cheesiest movies they could find ([[Fag|lalala]]). He was forced to watch all manner of [[crap|cheesy B-movies]] or face certain [[goatse]]ation by a pack of wild black persons. To mitigate the agony of [[unfunny]] movie-watching, he constructed four companion robots - Cambot, Gypsy, [[Vibrator|Tom Servo]], and Crow - from the S.O.L.'s spare parts (that is, props made from leftover junk Salvation Army patrons didn't want).

Luckily, you can forget about the shitty plot, as the writers admit that they only wrote it as a flimsy excuse to make fun of bad movies on TV. Every episode consists of the host (Joel or Mike, depending on whether it's good or not) being forced to watch a shitty movie. The movie-watching is punctuated with "Host Segments" which consist of comical interaction between the S.O.L. inhabitants and their captors (Drs Forrester and Erhardt, or Dr Forrester and [[Basement Dweller|TV's Frank]], or just Dr Forrester, or Pearl Forrester and her troupe of [[Retard|brain-dead]] faggots, comedic sketches, the Invention Exchange, interviews, and the [[Liek|like]]. Transitions between movie-watching and host segments required passage through a [[series of tubes|sequence of doors]], which became one of the show's hallmarks.

==ROBOT ROLL CALL==
[[Image:MST3kJoelAndtheBots.JPG|thumb|right|WTF COSPLAY?!?!?]]
[[Image:MST3K_mads.JPG|thumb|right|[[Fat dyke]] and company.]]

* '''Joel Robinson''' - The adorkable, laid-back original host of the show. Originally a janitor at the mad-science Gizmonic Institute. He did a good job cleaning up the place, but [[banned|his bosses didn't like him, so they shot him into space.]] Smarter than his robots, occasionally tortures them, basically a father to a decent family. He escaped in Season Five.
* '''Mike Nelson''' - Falsely believed to be a [[newfag]], he is actually the [[oldfag|head writer]] of the show. Mike replaces Joel in Season 5 and brings aboard his soothing baritone witticisms. Made [[cosplay]] appearances starting in season 2. Dumber than the 'bots, tortured by them like a [[frat]] pledge forever; [[No|buttmonkey]].
* '''Cambot''' - Pix or it didn't happen.
* '''[[Gypsy]]''' - Purple and gay, supposedly female, but clearly a man (and was in fact voiced by a guy in falsetto), not a staple of the show, usually occupied with piloting and maintenance which is [[Lie|supposedly]] why she is super dumb. When the ship is on manual control her brainmeats get a break and she becomes articulate and [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|sucks cock]].
* '''Tom Servo''' - The lovable and lighthearted gumball machine robot, the cynical and more mature of the robotic [[yiff|riff]]ing pair. Original voice Jew [[ragequit|emoquit]] after season 1 and later moved on to write for [[Bob Saget|America's Funniest Home Videos]].
* '''Croooooooow!''' - The golden, bowling-pin-mouthed slimy Jew wonder of scathing [[pervert|adolescent humor]].
* '''Dr. Clayton Forrester''' - [[Retarded]] weirdo who looks like Lesko.
* '''Dr. Laurence Erhardt''' - Dr. Forrester's kike assistant that nobody remembers. Dr. Forrester put him in the [[Holocaust|oven]] at the end of the first season, [[it is a mystery|right around when Tom Servo's voice changed]].
* '''[[Geert Wilders|TV's Frank]]''' - Clayton Forrester's fat man-bitch, later became a writer on ''[[Invader Zim]]'', so partly responsible for spawning the current generation of stupid [[emos]]. Now THAT'S evil.
* '''[[Rosie O'Donnell|Pearl Forrester]]''' - A [[fat]], enraged [[lesbian]] bent on the destruction of the [[dildo|Satellite of Love]], also a [[newfag]], but unlike Mike, lacked [[lulz]].
* '''Professor Bobo''' - A lame [[furry]] created in the image of ''Planet of the Apes''.
* '''Observer''' aka '''Brain Guy''' - [[Necrophiliac]].

All of the movies shown in the Satellite of Love are [[teh]] worst movies [[evar]]. In order to keep from going completely [[batshit crazy]], Joel/Mike and the Bots candidly heckle the movie with mocking comments, quips, and clever one-liners. The majority of the jokes fit into one or more of the following archetypes.

;'''Type one - [[Pop Culture]] Reference''' : '''Man:''' ''That's an asteroid!''<br> '''Joel:''' That's no asteroid...that's a battlestation!

;'''Type two - Dubbing''' : ''[Arriving at Dr. Craigis's house, Sherman looks up at the giant antenna on the roof.]'' <br> '''Joel [As Sherman]:''' I've fallen in with a group of [[old media|ham radio]] operators!

;'''Type three - Confusion'''
:''[Johnny spots a flying helicopter.]''
:'''Narrator''': "Oh, boy. A [[roflcopter|heel-a-copter airplane]]!"
:'''Servo''': [[LOL WUT|What]]?

;'''Type four - Interruption'''
:'''Mulder''': Ground's dry about an inch down. This was laid recently.
:'''Crow [as Mulder]''': … unlike me.

;'''Type five - Sarcasm'''
:''[The screen shows: "Are You Ready for Marriage?"]''
:'''Mike''': Um...yeah, I'm sick of sex, anyway.

;'''Type six - Oh Noes'''
:'''Spacecraft Captain''': ''We'' are the [[white|supreme race]]! ''We'' have the supreme weapons!
:'''Crow''': Ahh, turn [[Rush Limbaugh]] off!

;'''Type seven - Reassurance'''
:'''Joel''': Stay frosty, guys.

;'''Type eight - In-Jokes that only the MSTer Gets'''
:'''Pipper''': McGreggor?  Troy McGreggor? … Thomas' son?
:'''Troy''': Yeah! Did you know him?
:'''Servo [as Pipper]''': Know him? He was delicious!

==The "NEW" MST3K SHIT CARTOON==
[[Image:ThenewMST3K.jpg|right|thumb|A scene from the new ''MST3K'' cartoon.]]
[[Image:Botsrback.jpg|thumb|right|I feel dirty too]]

Because [[Minnesota]] sucks and they were bored because the show was canceled, all the cool funny people left, and the unfunny ones stayed behind to suck, they decided to make their own version and hired a [[Aspergers|Special Ed]] art class (possibly the same one responsible for those god-awful [[Hotel Mario|Phillips CD-i]] games) to make it for them, and the end result was shitty cartoons about butt-ugly robots.

==Trolling MST3Kers==

* Randomly pick Mike or Joel.  ''Insist'' to anyone you know who likes the show that the one you picked is way better than the other and keep bringing it up.
* Say you don't get the show and it's stupid.
* Complain about the riffing getting in the way of watching the movie.
* Complain that a movie wasn't really bad and so it really didn't deserve to be on MST3K.
* Complain that the robots don't look realistic.
* Complain that the "inventions" are impossible to make or wouldn't be commercially feasible.  Then give a tl;dr explanation why.
