The liberal media is a form of [[old media]].  It consists of NBC, CBS, ABC and [[your mom]].  The liberal media is often known to shoot out [[Meatspin.com|delusional spin]].  
==[[Drama]] on [[teh]] [[internets]]==
About [[100 years ago]], Dan Rather showed documents about [[shit nobody cares about|Bush's service during Vietnam]].  Of course, [[teh]] [[internets]] swooped in and proved the documents to be false.  Rather blamed the Microsoft Paperclip.  Of course, this whole situation is considered an [[old meme]] since no one really cared in the first place.
Citing the liberal media is also a great way to end any argument with a liberal.  
For example:
: Prima: "I don't think things in Iraq are going well because today 45 people were killed."
: Secunda: "Well thats nothing but delusional spin from the liberal media.  I bet you didn't hear that the side of a house was painted blue in Baghdad! [[Why do you hate America?]]"
Entire websites are devoted to this, and usually consist of [[idiot|God fearing American heroes who will stop at nothing to destroy the communist networks]].  Exposing the fact that [http://www.exposetheleft.com/2006/05/22/google-news-shuts-out-conservative-sites/#comments Google is liberally biased] and [http://www.exposetheleft.com/2006/05/14/gore-snl/#comments exposing the liberal bias of Saturday Night Live] are sure ways of inspiring drama in the masses.
