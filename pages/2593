In 2004, Ed posted a journal entry about his plans to move in with his underaged teenage "boyfriend", prompting his e-pals to go [[fap fap fap|"ewwwww"]]. Details began to surface about his previous conviction for aggravated sexual assault of a minor under 13. [[Dramacrat]]s at once set about making Ed's kiddie-diddling proclivities public knowledge through a series of articles on [[LJ Drama]] and through [[hardvice]]'s "Ed Rodriguez is kiddie-raping Love" [[colorbar]] [[meme]].

Shortly after this, [[LJ Abuse]] decided that reproducing information from government-issued public records was harassment, officially cementing LiveJournal's status as a safe haven where rapists and other convicted sexual predators could conveniently stalk new victims, and where those found guilty of the eminently [[lulzy]] act of public urination didn't have to be confused with convicted rapists and other sexual predators.
