Beecock

<br>
'''Bee Cock''' describes a photo in a series of images posted on [[Jameth|Jameth's]] [[LJ]]. This is commonly referred to as the [[Jameth Effect]]. The theme of the series was of penises covered in stinging or biting insects. Some of the penises had visible blood, from insect bites.

Posting a horrible thread in [[Something Awful|FYAD]] can result in it being ''beecocked'', where it is moved to the FYAD Dump and the original poster sees a giant picture of some bees on a cock.
