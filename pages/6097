Otherkin dating service
{{stub}}

The '''Otherkin dating service''' is a completely over-engineered and thus almost completely unusable dating site for deranged [[otherkin]] lust. It basically is the same as [[MySpace]] apart from any of the useful features like actually having your own page and profile. Also, instead of getting to pretend you are a [[Witch|Wiccan]] you can pretend you are an [[gay|Elf]], [[lesbian|Mermaid]], [[Vampire]], or whatever. It also asks questions like ''"What is your friendship with the world?"'' This should be seen as a rhetorical question since Otherkin's don't have friends nor any connection with the real world.
