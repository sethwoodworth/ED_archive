'''Pants Nazi''' and '''Shorts Nazi''' are derogatory terms used to describe participants in a discussion (online or otherwise) who criticize or correct the pants usage of other participants. These terms are often associated with accusations that the person is [[flamer|flaming]] by finding fault with minor details of other participants' pants. Participants in these discussions often end up taking opposite sides in the prescriptive/descriptive [[debate]].

As wearing pants is quite difficult, and missing pants quite commonplace, it is very easy to find someone not wearing pants that one can cling to in order to be a "Pants Nazi". In other cultures with more regular pants wearing, other clothing features might be used, as the shirt or the shoes.

==Pants Nazi Opposition==
While Pants Nazis do everything in their power to convert people to wearing pants, there exists a small but elite group of (most commonly) [[pedophiles]] who oppose these vulgar pro-pants [[gay boys]]. A prominent figure in this organization would be [[Michael Jackson]], known to rip off boys' pants in an effort to make the world a more pedophilia-accessible place. A major component of this movement consists of [[sharking]].
