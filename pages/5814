[[Furries]], as we know them today, are all '''Nolan Bushnell's''' fault.

First, he founded [[Atari]], making lonely, sexually frustrated kids think that [[video game]]s are cool.  Those kids graduated to [[computer]]s.  Then they hooked up their computers to the [[internets]]. But they would have never bothered with the whole deal if they didn't first think that electronics were cool.

Then, after Atari was bought out, Nolan Bushnell founded '''Chuck E. Cheese''', a haven of pizza, video games, and animatronic animals singing covers of Beatles songs. The results are astounding.  Millions of kids who would have never been exposed to animal costumes, except through brief visits to [[Disney]]land, were now enthralled by walking, talking [[fursuit]]s.  And they were able to visit Chuck E. Cheese whenever they wanted.

Eventually, worlds collided when these video game-playing, mascot costume-loving communities of deviants coalesced and let the world know of their sick, depraved proclivities.  Nolan Bushnell has a lot to answer for.
