Christian Teen Forums
On May 10th, 2008, around 7:20 p.m. PST, [[anon]] <s>[[I|owned]]</s> [[unfunny|made an ass of itself]] on [[Christian]] Teen Forums.

== The Premise ==

[[Juggernaut|If you don't know who they are]], it's a place filled with [[virgin]]-for-life [[Christians]], [[Pope|alter-boy crazy]] [[faggotry|Catholics]], [[JEWS_DID_WTC|self-hating Jews]], and [[Redneck|Baptists]] who have long since been [[v&|out of the loop]] on how much their [[God|invisible creator]] is going to bring [[2012|Rapture]] upon them. The plan was [[retarded|simple]], and completely fool-proofed - even the [[newfags]] couldn't fuck this one up.

Well...

== The Result ==

Basically, an Anon [[Bel-Air|got scared]] of their [[Bible|ghost stories]], stole a mod's password/email, and laid down the [[b&|hammer]] to anyone below level 4 on their Admin/Mod hierarchy. By May 11th [[9/11|(they shall nevar forget)]], every anon/femanon participating in this crap got their [[Permabanned|ISPs ganked]], [[B|/b/]] laughed at their fail, and a backraid was discussed with the [[r9k|true evil's secret base]], in case these complete failures ever picked their heads up from the series of tubes.

== The [[Fail|Original]] Plan ==

1. Find Gore

2. Type caption, "WHERE IS YOUR [[GOD]] NOW?"

3. Post on /b/

4. ?????

5. Profit!!!

[[DOING_IT_WRONG|Wow, wonder why that didn't work...?]]

== A [[Win|Working]] Plan ==

1. Find [[Sheep|Christians]]

2. Type piece of a scripture from the Bible that has meaning to you(use something from Luke, Job, or Psalms...black person), [[bait|but leave part of it out]].

3. Using [[TinyURL]], or [[Proxy|something better]], [[The Power 5|add a link for the remaining part]], and ask readers to click said link (claim it's a MySpace, LJ, etc. page link)

4. Repeat as necessary

5. ?????

6. [[PROFIT|Post on /b/]]



== The Mods and Admins ==

Being more corrupt than the Senate on Corresant, the mods and admins, even though they think they are above all the spineless members of their little cult-board, they are beneath the lowest form of life.  Their leader, whom is frequently compared to Hitler, is neither fit nor capable of running a forum.  He's an old Pedobear that lures teens to his board with promises of Jesus and Turkish delight.

Most notable, obnoxious, holier-than-thou [[Calvinist]] mod [[Pedobear|Soli Deo Gloria]] is known to have had camsex with fellow [[jailbait|underage]] mod Brekat, a moronic slut who has gotten around with more than one CTFer over the interwebs.  Considering his unbelievably self-righteous attitude and obsession with judging non-Christians, this is a recipe for particularly refined [[lulz]].

On around April 17, 2010, longtime member Ticketytak, a liberal (but still religious) member was banned in an ongoing blood purge of any and all remotely anti-Christian sentiment on CTF.  Members who have openly complained about his ban on the forum or in the chatroom have also been suspended or banned.  Feeling that CTF had 'strayed from its roots' (fundamentalist neocon bullshit), the mods have taken it upon themselves to enact a sort of kristallnacht against any and all who would not swear allegiance to the CTF reich.
