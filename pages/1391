[15:32] CooperINT187: Hi
[15:33] Glexia MikeW: Hello sir.
[15:33] CooperINT187: Will you be sending the remaining payment soon?
[15:33] Glexia MikeW: Huh?
[15:34] CooperINT187: What do you mean huh?
[15:34] CooperINT187: The payment for the glexia.com coding
[15:34] Glexia MikeW: Oh, you're the one who sent the email.
[15:34] Glexia MikeW: Correct?
[15:34] CooperINT187: Yes.. the recoding of glexia and modifications to the menu
[15:35] CooperINT187: You still owe me $125
[15:35] Glexia MikeW: Well, we're looking into that.
[15:35] Glexia MikeW: Who did you speak with regarding this?
[15:35] Glexia MikeW: And, do you have a contract that you can fax to us?
[15:35] Glexia MikeW: Or any AIM/Email logs?
[15:36] Glexia MikeW: Just forward everything to my email, zips of the conversations are fine.
[15:36] CooperINT187: I can't believe this.. I talk to you, Mike.. Where did you get the current code that's on the glexia.com site? From me
[15:36] CooperINT187: talked*
[15:37] Glexia MikeW: Sir, like I addressed in the email. I'm unfamiliar with what you are talking about. Once you forward the contract we signed, and any chat/email logs, we'll look into the issue.
[15:37] Glexia MikeW: And if our development team did indeed hire you, we will send out a check to you.
[15:37] Glexia MikeW: Also, please include an invoice for the work that you think was done.
[15:37] CooperINT187: Would you check your paypal records?
[15:37] Glexia MikeW: Sometimes our developers hire outside people and never let us know.
[15:37] CooperINT187: Is this Mike?
[15:37] Glexia MikeW: Sir, we don't use paypal.
[15:37] Glexia MikeW: Credit Card / Check & Money Order.
[15:38] Glexia MikeW: But when we pay contractors, we use Check only.
[15:38] Glexia MikeW: Due to liability of PayPal and other forms of payment.
[15:38] Glexia MikeW: Are you a hosting client, we do accept PayPal if you want to sign up for hosting.
[15:39] CooperINT187: Is this Mike?
[15:39] Glexia MikeW: Michael*
[15:39] Glexia MikeW: I go by Michael
[15:40] Glexia MikeW: However, it would not fit in my AIM.
[15:40] Glexia MikeW: But yes, my nickname to some, is Mike.
[15:40] Glexia MikeW: Would you be interested in signing up for hosting?
[15:41] CooperINT187: Please do not act like you do not know me
[15:41] CooperINT187: Where did you get the current glexia.com code from?
[15:42] Glexia MikeW: Well, recently we received an email from a client stating he had took it upon himself to redesign our website, he sold it to us for $300.
[15:43] CooperINT187: Please do not lie.. (Link: http://thunder.machdns.com/~hqmax/work/glexia2/)(Link: http://thunder.machdns.com/~hqmax/work/glexia2/)http://thunder.machdns.com/~hqmax/work/glexia2/
[15:43] Glexia MikeW: Sir, if you continue to accuse me of lying, I will just block you.
[15:44] CooperINT187: You asked me to send you a chat log, correct..
[15:44] CooperINT187: Please check your email
[15:44] Glexia MikeW: And a signed contract.
[15:44] Glexia MikeW: I'm going to check my email now.
[15:44] CooperINT187: No, there is no contract, there is a chat log
[15:44] Glexia MikeW: We would have sent you a contract if we did businesses with you.
[15:45] Glexia MikeW: Wait, are you hosted on our servers?
[15:45] CooperINT187: No
[15:45] Glexia MikeW: And which chat platform did these conversations take place on?
[15:45] CooperINT187: You hired me to recode the site and modify the menu
[15:45] CooperINT187: This chat platform (AIM)
[15:45] CooperINT187: What is on glexia.com is my work.. and it is unpaid for
[15:46] Glexia MikeW: I did not hire anyone, our development team did indeed post things on webhostingtalk.com and various other forums.
[15:46] Glexia MikeW: Are you sure you spoke to me?
[15:46] CooperINT187: You called me and recorded my voice
[15:46] Glexia MikeW: Haha, sure I did.
[15:47] CooperINT187: What is your phone number?
[15:47] Glexia MikeW: Our businesses?
[15:47] CooperINT187: Yes, the 1-800 number
[15:47] Glexia MikeW: It's located on our website. One moment, I'll get you the link.
[15:47] Glexia MikeW: Also, did you forward that contract yet?
[15:48] CooperINT187: There was no contract. Please read the chatlogs
[15:48] Glexia MikeW: (Link: http://glexia.com/?page=contact)http://glexia.com/?page=contact
[15:48] CooperINT187: I've sent them to your email address
[15:48] Glexia MikeW: I don't actually have time to read over them all. I have a meeting and will be heading out soon.
[15:48] Glexia MikeW: I saw the beginning though, which referred to WHT.
[15:49] Glexia MikeW: Until I see a contract authorized by Glexia, I cannot do anything for you; I'm sorry for the trouble you may be going though.
[15:49] Glexia MikeW: Because, honestly, I have a feeling your making this entire story up to obtain some money from us.
[15:50] CooperINT187: Mike, please do not do this.. I was honest and did the work.. You asked me to show it to you and I did... Now this?
[15:50] Glexia MikeW: But, before I prejudge you, I'll give you a opportunity to produce legal evidence, admissible into a court, that we did indeed purchase a service from you.
[15:51] Glexia MikeW: Sir, I'd prefer if you address me as Michael; however, I don't understand where you are coming from.
[15:51] Glexia MikeW: We do not do business like this without a contract.
[15:51] CooperINT187: Where did you obtain the coding for glexia.com from?
[15:51] CooperINT187: I have paypal payment records
[15:51] Glexia MikeW: That's great.
[15:51] Glexia MikeW: And just to tell you.
[15:52] Glexia MikeW: PayPal "records" are not considered a legal standing.
[15:52] Glexia MikeW: Nor do we EVER use paypal to pay our contractors.
[15:52] CooperINT187: glexia@gmail.com, whos that?
[15:52] Glexia MikeW: So that's fine that you have all the PayPal records you want but they do nothing.
[15:52] Glexia MikeW: May be one of our employees.
[15:52] Glexia MikeW: We own alot of Glexia@'s and we own the name "Glexia" on WHT.
[15:53] Glexia MikeW: Do you know the name of the employee you spoke with?
[15:53] Glexia MikeW: I could talk to him and have him give you a call.
[15:53] Glexia MikeW: Did you just lose your copy of the contract?
[15:54] CooperINT187: I spoke to you
[15:54] CooperINT187: There was no contract
[15:54] Glexia MikeW: .....
[15:54] CooperINT187: Check you email please
[15:54] Glexia MikeW: Than we did no businesses with you, I'm sorry sir.
[15:54] CooperINT187: I sent you an email regarding the work to be done before
[15:54] CooperINT187: Title is "Site Redesign"
[15:54] Glexia MikeW: No you did not.
[15:54] Glexia MikeW: Did I reply to it?
[15:54] Glexia MikeW: Or did anyone from @glexia.com reply?
[15:55] Glexia MikeW: Send me the email which was replied to that, with FULL headers.
[15:55] CooperINT187: You took the content of the email and put it in the subject of the paypal payment
[15:55] CooperINT187: Subject:
Website Work
Note:
Recoding the design into valid CSS code. This is a table-less, modern style of code. It's easy to maintain and change, as well it organizes data neatly.
Change the menu to look more stylistic. I intend to space it out a bit more, maybe give it some color, etc. Whatever looks good. CSS will be used for this.
Will provide you with recoded template in which you will be able to adapt your content into easily.
Also, changes on the menu will be made - menu will have images and be changed to look much nicer.

[15:57] Glexia MikeW: And I'll have to log into my paypal and see if anyone even sent that.
[15:57] Glexia MikeW: I don't care about chat logs.
[15:57] Glexia MikeW: They are useless.
[15:58] Glexia MikeW: I can make up chat logs with you and George Bush.
[15:58] CooperINT187: You asked me for them in the beginning of the convo
[15:58] Glexia MikeW: Because I assumed you did not speak with me.
[15:58] Glexia MikeW: And I could see which Glexia employee you spoke with.
[15:58] Glexia MikeW: And see what happened.
[15:58] Glexia MikeW: I think I would remember what I said.
[15:59] Glexia MikeW: Wow.... I logged into our paypal account.
[15:59] Glexia MikeW: Someone did send you 100$
[15:59] Glexia MikeW: I'm going to submit a chargeback to PayPal for this - as it's an unauthorized charge.
[15:59] CooperINT187: What?
[15:59] CooperINT187: That is my work on Glexia.com
[15:59] Glexia MikeW: Our account had actually been broken into - or suspected of being broken into - and was placed under hold.
[15:59] Glexia MikeW: Than we had it removed
[16:00] Glexia MikeW: And it seems someone did send a malicious payment to you.
[16:00] Glexia MikeW: Did you send yourself that payment from our account?
[16:00] Glexia MikeW: If you did, I strongly recommend you refund it.
[16:00] CooperINT187: Are you crazy?
[16:00] Glexia MikeW: Excuse me sir?
[16:00] CooperINT187: That is my work on glexia.com.. I expect the remainder of the payment
[16:00] Glexia MikeW: No it is not.
[16:00] Glexia MikeW: And until you produce a contract with these stipulations you speak of.
[16:00] CooperINT187: Yes it is
[16:00] Glexia MikeW: You will not get anything from Glexia.
[16:00] Glexia MikeW: Okay that's great. Enjoy your day sir, this conversation is done.
[16:01] Glexia MikeW: Have fun trying to scam people.
[16:01] Glexia MikeW: I'm going to be reporting your activities to the FTC.
[16:01] Glexia MikeW: As they are completely unethical and against moral policies.
[16:03] CooperINT187: I did this work, please do not accuse me of such things
[16:03] CooperINT187: I am no scammer
[16:03] Glexia MikeW: Sure you arn't.
[16:03] Glexia MikeW: That's why you made up a conversation between myself and you.
[16:03] CooperINT187: I did not make anything up
[16:03] Glexia MikeW: And tried to obtain money from a company when you had no contract or legal groundings to back yourself up.
[16:03] Glexia MikeW: Yep, I'm sure you didn't.
[16:04] Glexia MikeW: A complaint is filed against you via PayPal.
[16:04] CooperINT187: Excuse me? I did all of that work
[16:04] CooperINT187: I cannot believe this
[16:04] Glexia MikeW: You, sir, did not do anything,.
[16:04] Glexia MikeW: Except try to scam people.
[16:05] CooperINT187: Please do not call me a scammer. I did that work.. I have it on my own computer
[16:05] Glexia MikeW: You have what on your computer?
[16:05] CooperINT187: And i thought you said glexia does not use paypal
[16:06] Glexia MikeW: We do not use it to pay contractors.
[16:06] Glexia MikeW: We only do that though credit card (for trusted ones) and check for all others.
[16:06] CooperINT187: That is my code on your website!
[16:06] Glexia MikeW: All our contracted services (such as support, etc, are paid though Credit Card) and all the rest (such as website programming) are paid via Check.
[16:06] Glexia MikeW: No sir, it is not, you are very much mistaken.
[16:07] Glexia MikeW: Also, may I recommend you do not try to tell Bill Gates that that's your code on his website too.
[16:07] Glexia MikeW: Because he's going to tell you the same thing I am. It's not your code.
[16:22] Glexia MikeW: Sir, I also recommend that you stop trying to scam people. If you do it again, I can assure you they won't be as nice as me and will file charges against you.
