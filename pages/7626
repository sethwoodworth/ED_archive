Snugglenets (Originally called Dong Escrow [[IRC]]) is an [[IRC]] network originally started after some [[Drama]] started up in [[Get_On_IRC_Fgt|EDIRC]], forcing [[Sherrod]] to [[Quitting_IRC_forever|Shut everything the fuck down]]. [[User:NeoLobster|Chatters]] needed a place that was snuggly and [[clam]] to get their chats on.

= History =
The history of Snugglenets is ever-changing. Various people have attempted to link with snugglenets IRC. None have succeeded in STAYING linked to Snugglenets.
=== Standalone Network ===
The first incarnation of Snugglenets, this era saw Snugglenets through its inception. As the founders of Snugglenets searched the depths of other IRC networks to find Encyclopedia Dramatica expatriates, a core user base was established, and the snuggling had commenced. During this era, DongBot made his first appearance, scraping and displaying [[Craigslist]] personals ads for [[lulz|max_enjoyment]].
=== Part of Klulz ===
[[Over_9000|Over 9000]] years ago, Snugglenets and Hardchats joined together to make a network where snuggling and chatting hard would live in harmony. Eventually Glob decided #dongescrow was "too [[gay]]" (as a channel called #dongescrow should be) and killed his Ziplink. During this time, DongBot was in his prime, spouting [[Craigslist]] personals at an astonishing rate into #dongescrow.

=== Standalone Network ===
In this transitional phase of Snugglenets' history, the focus was mainly on securing the Snugglenets hub amidst flood attacks and [[DDOS]]es from [[Klulz]]. [[User_talk:garrettisvuln|garrett]] had the [[retard|brilliant]] idea to link up with [[IRC|Ezbake]], mainly as a source of protection against the [[Klulz]] [[Penis_Pump|Pumpers]]. During this time, Snugglenets changed hosting companies, losing such wonderful bots as Dongbot in the process.
=== Part of EZBake ===
In what was possibly the shortest era of Snugglenets, the EZBake phase was a huge disruption to the snuggling experience. Services went away in favor of [[shit|Starburst]] services which went down more often than [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] does on [[Cocks]]. Eventually some [[Drama]] unfolded and [[IRC|EZBake]] was dismantled in the middle of the night, leaving Snugglenets all alone once again. This era introduced snugglers to IRC Uno and [[Tranny|Trannies]]. 
=== Standalone Network ===
After the overnight delinking and implosion of the EZBake Network, snugglers had to get used to regular services again, as [[shit|Starburst]] got everyone used to such wonderful commands as .int nick, while sacrificing such important things as Operserv, Chanserv, and Nickserv. Then along came Relentless.
=== Relentless Era ===
Relentless linked up a server to Snugglenets, set up statistic gathering and all that other crap that tiny [[irc]] networks don't need. After he got everything beautifully set up, Snugglenets decided Relentless was [[you|Just too gay]] and delinked.
=== Standalone Network ===
So stands Snugglenets today. [[Drama]]-free for the most part (lol garrett). NeoBot keeps track of our twitters and tweets, and #dongescrow lives on even now that ED IRC is back up and running.

City/State Metrosexuopolis, #dongescrow is a place where many EDitors, Dramacrats and Philolsophers go to chill out. Dongescrow is responsible for maintaining the [[Dong Mosaic]]. Dong Escrow is a gay-friendly chat, because it's maintained by a bunch of [[you|fags]]. Chat on the 'nets comes in both Soft and Hard varieties, with varying levels of hate depending on day and seasonal conditions. As elsewhere, Jew are generally discouraged from attending.
