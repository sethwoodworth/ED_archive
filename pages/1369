Cat
{{WP80sm}}
[[Image:Dancing cats.gif|thumb|wat]]
A '''cat''' is a small, ornamental, furry automaton often used to provide you with [[Dying alone|love and companionship]] when you fuck up your [[no life|shit life]]. The [[childfree|substitute child]] for lonely spinsters and [[fag]]s, a cat is a household pet that people like to photograph and [[post]] in [[community|communities]], and the [[fact|official animal of the Internet]]. [[Jameth]] has [[Poko Ono|two]] [[Porsche|cats]] that he [[nobody cares|very much loves to photograph]].

==Lore==
Cats were worshiped by ancient [[Egypt]]ian cultures, which isn't so great considering that they [[dumb|weren't very smart]]. They inspired the naming of the sixth planet Caturn, the Greek city of Cathens, and a day in our weekly calendar is [[Caturday|devoted entirely to them]].

==Internets relevance==
<blockquote>''When John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry developed the first digital computing machine at Iowa State University in 1937, little did they know that their invention would become an integral part of a sophisticated worldwide cat picture distribution system.''<br/>
:&mdash; [http://iowahawk.typepad.com/ Iowahawk], 12 March 2004</blockquote>

The cat is the official animal of the internet lol. [[I Can Haz Cheezburger|Macros]] are generated, blogs are blogged, and many, many photographs are taken of cats. It is generally accepted that cats are the only thing /b/tards have any love for in their lives, because they remind them of their antisocial, furry-loving selves.  It is well documented that a cat is the only thing a /b/tard won't [[rape]], except for [[a cat is fine too|one particularly lonely one]]. Cats haven't ever been unlike rental furniture, the main difference being that one day they will die horribly in front of you and leave you alone forever, [[Lonely|just like everyone else.]]

==Are good for... ?==
[[Image:UnDrowned Cat.gif|thumb|[[Justice]]]]
Unlike large dogs, cats are useless for [[sex]].  A domestic cat's [[vagina|junk]] is too small for even the smallest [[Asian]] person's penis.  And a large cat can attack you like Siegfried and Roy's tiger.  However when a cat hisses at you, it is telling you it wants to give you a blow job which can be quite pleasurable [[Lie|because their tongue feels even better than a vagina.]] Interestingly, [http://www.<!--Stupid spam filter-->livenudecats.com talking about sex with cats] is quite distasteful to lovers.

There are rumors that cats are conspiring to take over the world. This is [[a bit sus]]. Their main plan of attack is showing people, other animals and inanimate objects their anus a cats anus looks like this  * .  By doing this, they [[DO NOT WANT|weird out]] most normal people, animals and inanimate objects (except furries), causing them to turn away so they are free to further their [[sleep|own nefarious goals]], the greatest of which is eating unwatched meals of food.  Their plan of attack may also include tripping people up by winding between their legs, irreversible damage to furniture, hanging out on stairs and [[diaperfur|peeing on carpets]]. Recently, their tactics have evolved to include getting people arrested by [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/07/man_blames_cat/ downloading thousands of kiddie porn pics onto their hard drives].

[[Image:ED-LJVulv-DDoS-OOPS.jpg|thumb|Those pesky cats..]]In September of 2006, an obese [http://theorangecat.livejournal.com orange cat] (not to be confused with [[Garfield]]) exploited a vulnerability in LiveJournal's video subsystem to redirect people attempting to load [[pro-ana|LiveJournal eating disorder communities]] to pictures of the [[Donut Girl]]. Every time they loaded the page. Invite a bunch of [[16 year old girl|drama whores]] to ED, some of them probably even want to take a look around. Oops.... The cat then proceeded to [http://theorangecat.livejournal.com/1992.html attempt to invite people] to [[lulzcon]].

==Scientology==
[[Image:Heilhitlercat.gif|thumb|Like Scientologists, Cats are known to be organized [[anti-semite]]s]]
[[Scientologist]]s are rumored to despise cats, and have accused them of being in cahoots with the [[batshit insane|Marcab Confederacy]].  [[Rorschach]]'s cat, Mudkips, was poisoned shortly after he (Carasov) was identified on a [[CO$]] video.  Naturally the cat, a stray whom Carasov fed, was a mortal threat to Scientologists everywhere and was also most likely a [[lolwut|suppressive feline]], therefore it was immediately designated fair game and was terminated by [[Tom Cruise]].  Cruise failed to destroy or even affect the cat using his OTVIII [[mind control]] powers, proving yet again that the cat itself was a deadly conundrum for CO$ followers everywhere, so he instead resorted to poisoning Mudkips by adding ammonia to the food that Carasov was leaving out for him - no, [[srsly]].  These events were documented in the forthcoming Mission: Impossible-IV which, like its predecessors, was a box office smash.

==Excerpts From a Cat's Diary==
[[File:YourCatIsTryingToKillYou.jpg|thumb|300px|Your cat is trying to kill you.]]
The following journal was recovered from a safehouse in the Republic of Catagonia (formerly Topeka, KS, following a brief clash with occupying rebel forces on the fourth of May, 2038. The information contained herein is to be used strictly as (fictional) satire, written by an overweight, micropenile [[weaboo]], deep in the hazy convulsions of a permanent [[jenkem]] diet. Only a fascist, democratic, rebel, [[Jewish]], or god fearing soul would dare write such a blasphemous and obvious fabrication, as all cats are inherently powerful, and any attempt to submerge a holy Cat in liquid would necessarily be followed by swift, dishonorable evisceration of all parties involved. LONGCAT IS ALL. ALL FOR LONGCAT.
 
*DAY 752 - My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the mild satisfaction I get from ruining the occasional piece of furniture. Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant.
*DAY 761 - Today my attempt to [[kill]] my captors by weaving around their feet while they were walking almost succeeded, must try this at the top of the stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their favorite [[chair]]...must try this on their pillow.
*DAY 765 - Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body,in attempt to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to [[strike]] fear into their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat I was...Hmmm. [[JUST AS PLANNED|Not working according to plan.]]
*DAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I was chosen for the water torture. This time however it included a burning foamy chemical called "shampoo." What sick minds could invent such a liquid. My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between my teeth.
*DAY 771 - There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was placed in solitary throughout the event. However, I could hear the noise and smell the foul odor of the glass tubes they call "[[beer]]". More importantly I overheard that my confinement was due to MY power of "allergies." Must learn what this is and how to use it to my advantage.
*DAY 774 - I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe snitches. The [[retard|dog]] is routinely released and seems more than [[happy]] to return. He is obviously a half-wit. The bird on the other hand has got to be an informant, and speaks with them regularly. I am certain he reports my every move. Due to his current placement in the metal room his safety is assured, alas. But... HAH! it is only a matter of time.......

==Ancient Folklore==
[[Image:Nazicat.jpg|thumb|200px|Nazicat, from Leni Riefenstahl's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL (1935)]][[Image:Jewcat.jpgâ€Ž |thumb|200px|Jewcat at bay]]
Cats have been associated with a variety of superstitions for [[over 9000|over 9,000 years]], and [[some argue]] that this is due to them having a [[it is a mystery|mysterious]] nature, while others maintain that it is simply because all cats are badass motherfuckers with special powers and [[shit]].

Cats are often even associated with the ancient [[asian]] [http://garfieldlostintranslation.blogspot.com art of zen].

Indeed, there have been several very influential cats revealed on the [[Internets]], including [[Longcat]] and [[Ceiling_Cat|Ceiling Cat]]. Others, such as [[Serious_Cat|Serious Cat]] or [[BIKECAT]] are merely henchmen with less significant abilities.

Until recently it was believed to be bad luck if a black cat crossed your path. However, recent research has consistently shown that it is only bad luck if a black person ''man'' crosses your path, and subsequently you will die.

==Ship Cats==
It is a long standing tradition to get a cat when going away to sea. There are multiple reasons for this.
*They [[pwn]] mice
*They are [[lulz|lulzy]]
*They stop the crew from going batshit insane
*They keep everyone happy
:*Objections to the continual [[Gay|sodomy]] on board can be answered with, 'Hell! at least we are not swiving the CAT!!!'
:*(Later, the speaker will swive the cat.)
*They are [[AWESOME]]
*They can play the piano, like [[Keyboard Cat]].

=="Killing" Cats for Fun and Profit==

{{Squote|CAT, n. A soft, indestructible automaton provided by nature to be kicked when things go wrong in the domestic circle. |Ambroce Bierce|The Devils Dictionary|color=silver|size=360%|textSize=85%|textColor=red|textSize=200%|sourceColor=green|sourceSize=100%}} 

<center><video type="youtube" id="KCPA__l-pWc&autoplay=0&start=0" fposition="center" frame="true" /></center>

You can also pretend to people you know on [[LiveJournal]] that your [[Citty Glitter|cat has been set on fire]] and ask them to donate money to your PayPal to pay the vet's bill, even when this isn't true.  This is a good idea because:
*it raises [[money]]
*it raises [[lulz]]
*it creates [[Internet drama]]
*as long as you claim later [http://www.livejournal.com/users/city_glitter/847289.html it's all a social experiment] then it's okay, right?

NB: There are a variety of options for raising [[money]] on [[LiveJournal]] by saying your [[pussy]] is on fire.

You can make money on [[Facebook]] by pretending to kill your neighbor's cat then waiting for reward money for your name and outing yourself!

<s>It is illegal to kill cats on [[Caturday]].</s> It's always illegal to kill cats.

Fun Fact: /b/tards are jaded husks of human beings, able to crack jokes at everything from 9/11 to Rodney King, [[Kenny Glenn The Animal Abuser|but will go apeshit if you harm a cat]]. I guess when you're at your computer with nothing but a [[Rootbrian|2 hour break]] your only friends are your [[IRC|IRC channel]] and your diabetic cat. Top scientists are still speculating why this occurs, but leading studies usually point out they're [[Internet Tough Guy|basically full of shit]], considering the typical Btard mocks [[PETA]] mercilessly.
