Troll
[[File:Shirtrollin.jpg|right|thumb|TROLLIN' AIN'T EASY.]]
The oft-abused term "troll" has, over the past few decades, evolved for some into an ideology with a distinct methodology. Seen by many as "Internet Eugenics" - ridding the tubes of idiots, people who take themselves too seriously, [[bloggers]] and the [[Scum|like]]. Others even go to the extent of idealising it to the point of qualifying the likes of Socrates as such; clearly outreaching from the more common consensus that trolling as we understand it originated on the Internet.
However you see it, trolling has become omnipresent on the Internet; for the better and the worse.

|Trolling is a method, a style of rhetoric and action. It can be used for constructive or destructive purposes. Some of the greatest champions of Western philosophy have implemented the troll method.

|You look for someone who is full of it, a real blowhard. Then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama, laughs and lulz. Rules would be simple: 1. Do whatever it takes to get lulz. 2. Make sure the lulz is widely distributed. This will allow for more lulz to be made. 3. The game is never over until all the lulz have been had.

|That, I believe, is what being a troll is about. Saying what needs to be said at the right time.

|In Internet slang, a troll is someone who posts inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum, chat room, or blog, with the primary intent of provoking other users into a desired emotional response.

==Generalisation of trolling==
[[File:Trollingbackinthedays.jpg|left|thumb|Trolling used to mean something]]
Trolling usually consists of posting content that is intended to spark up a [[Flame War]], [[Shitstorm]], Internet fallout and the like, mainly for the entertainment of the Troll and his/her "friends". Another reason advanced by the infamous [[Jason Fortuny]] of the "Craigslist Experiment" is that trolling is a means of "finding answers about human behaviour". Of course, Jason is an idiot and generally shunned by most internet users so his opinion is neither particularly valuable nor interesting. Whatever the motives are, observing or posting a good troll is just simply exciting. 

The content varies widely; it can be anything from yet another new troll face/endless variation of a [[meme]] on 4Chan to the classic vim vs. emacs on the Ubuntu forums. Whatever is used, an important aspect of trolling consists of knowing what you are doing: there’s nothing more tiresome than some kid trying to be cool OTI by being overly aggressive and refusing to admit that he failed. Generally speaking, a Troll is finding a way of initiating angst in idiots for amusement and in the hope that anyone allowing themselves to be hurt by someone on the other side of the planet will leave the Internet.

==Origins==
[[File:Trollface.png|thumb|right|Truth]]
Many people have put forward various different possible origins of the term "trolling". The most widely accepted one is that it started in the late 80s/early 90s on [[Usenet|alt.folklore.urban]] where it meant reposting questions and topics that had been repeatedly overdone. In this sense, it was a harmless way of “baiting” new users into replying and making arses of themselves. Trolling here coming from the fishing technique where you bait one or more lines and slowly reel the fish in if they bite.

==How to identify a troll==
Most people who identify as a troll are, unsurprisingly, 12 year old kids with nothing of value to contribute, people angered by a [[ban]], or users upset that no one pays [[attention]] to them. As expected, the only harm they do is make themselves look like idiots. Typically their posts are overly abusive, conspicuous and badly written. The topics are generally well known to be abused by Trolls and the poster would never be able to pass for genuinely interested in their question because of it. A good troll on the other hand is usually extremely difficult to out: knowing what they’re doing, they are able to bluff through a whole argument, giving the impression that they’re truly interested in the topic while watching the whole community go down on the thread in a mass of flame wars, [[ad hominem]] attacks and much generally much anger.

==Different kinds of troll==
[[File:Troll-identification-poster.jpg|thumb|Inside the mind of a troll]]
Most people calling themselves trolls tend to focus on a single medium, be it [[youtube]], online [[video games]], [[forum]]s or [[IRC]].
 
===Hater===
Almost exclusively used on Youtube, a hater (Or h8r) is a troll who searches for [[USI]] vloggers, cry babies or influenceable kids and picks out the logical fallacies in their political [[vlog]], calls out overly dramatic attention whores on their obvious flaws, and ridicules kids on their lack of understanding of the "[[real world]]"   

An impressive amount of user videos consists of people complaining about haters.

===Griefer===
As the haters are on youtube, the griefers are present in most video games. Spamming the in-game chat window, role-breaking, teamkilling, camping, spawnkilling, and [[hacking]] are some of the prefered means of trolling a online gaming community.



{{main|Griefing}}

===Troll for a day===
When a [[board]] suffers from group think and stagnation, sometimes one poster will create a new account and log in to tweak the other posters into a flame war. The Troll for a Day will announce they are a TFAD (TFADing) and everyone will congratulate the regular after getting over their murderous impulses for bring the community back to life. 

Posters on message boards who have experienced this behavior will immediately try to label all newcomers as "TFADs".

==Notable trolling organisations==
Many [[trolling organization|trolling organisations]] have been created over the years. Some brilliant, the vast majority terrible. Typically seeing the same users over several groups, trolling organisations tend to gently merge over time.

===Bantown===
[[File:Bantown_Class_of_2006.jpg|thumb|right|Bantown Class of 2006]]
Bantown was one of the most productive troll "organisations" to grace the Internet. Being a loose group composed of illustrious trolls and [[kewl kids]] such as [[Weev]], Revmischa, [[Crayolacrime]], [[Hepkitten]], [[Mediacrat]], [[Aardvark]], [[Oclet]], [[Wattage]] and [[OldDirtyBtard]], Bantown gave us amazing trolls, outstanding scripts to flood IRC and fun times.

Well known trolls by #Bantown regulars:
*[http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/06/25/1440236| Freenode takeover.]
*Lulzcon performance by Weev and Revmischa on the infamous Firefox Java exploit.

The Gay Nigger Association of America™ was created in January 2003 by timecop (President and CEO) and [[jesuitx]] (Vice President) to protect the rights and interests of all men of [[African]] and [[Homosexual]] persuasions. Starting their operations in a grandiose manner: trolling [[Slashdot]] using [[ASCII]] art logos representing the organization and satirical news releases pertaining to the contents of Slashdot articles, the GNAA, currently under the presidency of Murdox following weev's incarceration, continues to push the frontiers of trolling ever further.

Some of the more lulz-worthy trolls delivered by GNAA members are:
