HOW CAN SHE SLAP?!?
{{Forced Meme}}

'''HOW CAN SHE SLAP?!?''' is a [[meme]] that originated on September 6th, 2008, when some [[newfag]] posted a link to an [[India|Indian]] game show. Apparently, the show's planners [[failed]] to brief the contestants about not [[Insane|flipping their shit]] on stage, because when the hostess delivered an unscripted slap to a contestant, he returned fire with a [[Gb2kitchen|GB2KITCHEN HO]] that was so [[Penis|hard]], they BOTH damn near fell over.  The [[White Knight|crew]] thereafter decided to fulfill the prophecy.

Forget ''"Doomsday vs Superman"'' or ''"Uwe Boll vs Lowtax"''... What followed was a brown-on-brown reworking of the Rodney King beating.

In "Dadagiri" (or "[[Masturbate|Beat the Bullies]]"), students are put through three rounds in which they are relentlessly [[trolled]] by three stock characters.

In between each round is an eliminator in which ''[[LOL WUT|Juicy The Chef]]'' forces the contestants to eat [[Slipknot|maggots]] and caterpillars out of a toilet (seriously, that's what it says here), and the last man standing wins 50,000 rupees (about $1,000). The ultimate winner of the contest will be announced on [[9/11]], no, [[Srs|seriously]].

==The Incident==

Esha was going through her normal shtick and the contestants were calmly ignoring her, only rising to her to say "[[Gtfo|We don't want to talk to you.]]" She eventually conceded defeat, but the show's host prodded her back into the fray. This frustrated Esha, who shouted "Why don't you just go [[fuck off]], then?!" to contestant Ravi Bhatia, who smiled pleasantly and replied "[[NO U|You go]]", whereupon the fateful slap took place. It became instantly clear that Ravi had no choice but to [[pwnt|knock a bitch out.]]

As can be seen above, the shit hit the fan pretty fast as Ravi was hurled to the floor by enraged studio staff, and the Calcutta Historical Re-Enactment Society give us their version of the Rodney King incident. Gaffers, lighting staff, sound staff, men with clipboards, and the guy who just came to deliver the pappadums all patiently wait their turn at pummeling Ravi's face into couscous. Ravi can be heard [[BAW|weeping]] with [[fail]] and cracked ribs from the center of the tangle of boots and [[Weegee|moustaches]], wailing the mantra that was to become his epitaph:

{{quote|[[How do I shot web?|HOW CAN SHE SLAP?!?]]}}

For maximum lulz, one staff member can be heard calling for Ravi's sister to be brought up on the stage. FYI: "madarchod" and "behenchod" can be heard quite clearly in the video. And since you can hear that, you [[Pakis|sand nigra]]! Jokes apart, [[Fact|such face-massages are a common mating ritual among young Indians]]. India-loving [[Caucazn|Caucazns]] can alternatively try [[Raep|singing bollywood songs or tender loving with romantic dinners]].

UPDATE:

LOL

Bitch got slapped and sued.

This gameshow prepares young Indian cookery students for the harsh reality of life in [[Australia]].
