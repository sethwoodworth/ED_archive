Anne Rice

The ultimate in literary [[drama queen]]s, [[Anne Rice]] is a novelist whose vampire novels have served as inspiration for countless [[fangirl]]s, [[cosplay]]ers, [[Homosexual|gay]] [[teenager]]s, and, of course, [[goth]]s. Indeed, even to this day — some thirty years after her first work was published — she maintains a loyal [[fandom|following]] among [[16 year old girls]] and [[angsty teen]]s. [[Twilight|Recently, however; an even more insipid brand of Mary Sue has reared its hideous visage from the bowels of sexual frustration.]]


== Biography ==
Many [[fan]]s attribute Rice's success to her talent as a writer but it was happenstance that resulted in her fame and prosperity. Had Rice been born later in the century, she would not have written ''Interview with the [[Vampire]]'', her first and most famous piece of [[slashfic]], but instead would have signed up for [[LiveJournal]]. With that done, Rice's overly illustrative and [[stream of consciousness]] ramblings would have made her an [[Internet celebrity]], causing her to forgo writing [[IRL]] in favor of the [[attention]] garnered by her [[fanfic]].

[[Image:Fan.jpg|thumb|Anne Rice's early years.]] 

Rice is too cowardly to live in [[New Orleans]], a city with which she is [[obsession|obsessed]], where she [[fat|gains weight]] as a result of [[depression]] triggered by her son's success as an author and possibly her [[Diabeetus]].

Her real name is Howard Allen O'Brien.

In November 2005, Rice released a book called ''Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt'', written to show her deep [[Christian]] convictions. It is assumed that most of her fans, particularly rebellious [[goth]]s, will choose to ignore this book, as a Christian author certainly makes ''The Vampire Chronicles'' less cool. In an attempt to continue to appeal to the 12-year-old [[internet]] [[whores]], Rice revealed she would like her [[Jesus]] to be played by Johnny Depp. In reality, [[I did it for the lulz|she wrote it for the lulz]], although the idea that God told her to [[STFU]] about vampires is comforting.

Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for applause, for it is thanks to Anne Rice that we have a new generation of pseudo-[[vampire]]s.

==[[Sock puppet]]s==

===Anne Rampling===
Using the pseudonym Anne Rampling, Ms. Rice published two shoddy, semi-pornographic novels, one of which, ''Exit To Eden'', was made into a shoddy, not-at-all-pornographic movie. As written, it takes place on a sex resort for the rich and perverted. It is a tender love story, about a supermodel sexual sadist and her studly masochist slave. Especially moving is the passage in which the heroine ass rapes her sweetheart with a giant strap-on while he cries "Yes, mommy, yes!"

Hollywood faithfully adapted the novel for the big screen, only making one or two changes to keep an "R" rating. Dan Akroyd was cast as the masochist, [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as his supermodel mistress, and the ass-raping scene was changed to a friendly chat at an ice cream parlor. The plot no longer revolved around murder and dildos and had more to do with a lost puppy named Spanky. Comforted by the royalty check, Anne Rice did not die from self-righteous indignation.

===AN Roquelaure===
AN Roquelaure is the sock puppet used by Ms. Rice when she really wants to get nasty. In ''The Claiming of Beauty'', ''Beauty's Punishment'', and ''Beauty Goes To Hogwarts'', she covers the adventures of a captured sex slave [[Mary Sue|who looks just like Ms. Rice]] - except that she is young, beautiful, and intelligent.

==MAJOR FUCKING NEWS==
Anon has decided that, because her books contain rampant slash, bishounen, poor grammar, [[crossovers]] and other shit, there is no need for Anne Rice fanfiction. The books themselves are fanfiction enough.

Yet despite this, Anne Rice still decided that if you write any fanfiction about one of her works, she'll get the [[V&|party van]] on your ass. [[azn|Rice]] declared that fanfics are bad, and they make her [[emo|sad]] to see them. She then proceeded to [[troll]] all of her fans about it. From a legal standpoint, it is unclear as whether or not she can actually do this, as a character itself cannot be copyrighted. One cannot copyright a word itself, for example, only a string of words. The correct term would be "Trademarked," and since this isn't mentioned, feel free to write millions of pages of horrible Lestat and Pokemon slashfics. 

{{quote|IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM ANNE ON "FAN FICTION"
Anne has posted the following message regarding fan fiction: "I do not allow fan fiction. The characters are copyrighted. It upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters. I advise my readers to write your own original stories with your own characters. '''It is absolutely essential that you respect my wishes'''."|http://www.annerice.com/ReaderInteraction-MessagesToFans.html}}

Pshaaaaww.

{{quote|The [[raids|attacks]] consisted of, amongst other things, e-mailed threats regarding not only the writing of fanfiction but any writing that any fanfic author attempted to engage in (regardless of who owned the copyright), attacks on businesses that the fanfic authors owned and weeks of harassing personal letters sent to fanfic author's e-mail addresses and guestbooks. Personal information about fanfic authors was also dug up by Anne Rice employees and used as part of the harassment.|Webmaster of a popular Anne Rice fanfiction site}}

Her gothic fanbase proceeded to cry black tears over the loss of their[[ banhammer]]ed works, while the rest of the internets rejoiced at the cleansing of terrible fanfiction based off terrible stories.


===Pissing Away a Livelihood===

After making millions of dollars off of Sad Teens, and delusional virgins of all kinda; Anne Rice became a Born Again Christian. This made her whole dedication to the Occult and other kinds of "Boogedy Woogedy" an exercise in futility/sham. Satan started [[emo|cutting himself]] over the betrayal. It should be noted that her only child is a [[Gay|fudge packer]]. And I'm not talking about the dead [[slut|one]].
