==Plot Synopsis==

'''Old Gregg''' comes from a UK show called "[[The Mighty Boosh]]". The meme gained popularity after [[Adult Swim]] began airing episodes late night on [[Cartoon Network]], one of which was the Old Gregg episode. In said video, a musician named Howard Moon is fishing in a lake at night when he is confronted by a [[transexual]] merman  with a [[Lens flare|glowing]] [[mangina]] named Old Gregg.  Old Gregg takes the musician captive in his underground cavern where he treats the stranger to a drink of Bailey's, shows off his waterpaint [[art]], and accompanies him in a [[Music|song]] and [[Party Hard|dance]].
