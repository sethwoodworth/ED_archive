==America's only president who didn't choke on cock==
[[Image:WashingtonTime.JPG|thumb|Washington needs [[you|your]] help to write the Constitution, and amend it with lowering the age of consent.]]

Founding the [[United States]], Washington made it his duty to protect: 
* freedom of speech
* people from a privately controlled federal bank
* freedom to grow your own pot (which he grew himself)
* the private sector from [[iraq|starting wars]]

Of course slowly amurrika [[w|became a cesspool of failure]] and abolished his hard work by taking a steaming, warm shit on the constitution. 

He was honored for his hard work by having the shittiest state [[Washington|named after him]]

== George owned [[Niggers]] ==

George Washington didnt care about freedom for all people, only [[white people]]. Being the true [[american]] hero he was he owned a whole family of niggers (or about 100, cause they breed like [[spics]]). Infact he lent his niggers to his friends to help pick cotton. If his niggers steped out of line, he would [[beat]] the [[shit]] out of them, like a true american hero. Also, he allows niggers to lick his butt.
