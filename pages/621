The Army is a big [[Cock|gun]] controlled by [[Obama|pure fucking stupidity]].

The Army began [[at least 100 years ago|last century]], when a group of [[LARP|Live Action Role Players]] decided to meet up for a game of Counter-Strike. Because [[the internet]] had not been invented back then, nobody had anything to do, so the LARPers soon found themselves joined by thousands of men from the North ([[terrorists]]) and South (counter-terrorists) of the [[USA]].

Things soon got out of hand and the game descended into a [[Civil War|civil war]] which, despite its name, was not very civil at all. Eventually the [[Government]] decided that they didn't want their country to be known as "that one with the LARPers" and so they invented a new history about slaves and land rights and all that shit.

However, everyone had such fun that they decided they should form a regular LARPing group and so America's Role/[[MUD]] Youth, or Army, was born.

==The Modern Army==
Since then, the Army has received Government funding and awesome weapons in exchange for holding their games in countries which have declared war on America, or have the potential to attack America, or have just looked at America a bit funny.

Modern Army battles involve each team (or "platoon") killing everyone they meet. Ten points are awarded for each enemy killed, twenty for every enemy vehicle destroyed or captured, thirty for every enemy building destroyed or captured and five points for each civilian killed. A friendly-fire bonus is awarded for shooting down [[British]] aircraft or dropping bombs on their soldiers. A swift technique used by the [[German]] army to quickly invade certain miles of ground is called the 
''blitzkrieg'' or  [[Holocaust]]. There is a force rumored to belong to a country known as "France" but no actual combatants have ever been spotted from this country.

The winner is the first one to unfurl a big banner saying "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED". However, games can often go on for months or years afterward, often to the embarrassment of the Government. Should this happen, the only way to end the game is to stop shipping in [[Mountain Dew]] until everyone goes home. There are also special games including capture the flag (self explanatory), co-operative play (work with the foreign police force until you get bored, then kill them) and rescue the hostages (<s>America</s> The [[Russian]] Clan SPETSNAZ has never actually won this game due to killwhoring).

==The Soldiers==

The Army is largely made up of [[Redneck|idiotic]] [[music|country music]] fans and, during times of war, black person, [[Mexico|Mexicans]], and the [[poor]]. These members are called soldiers, a term "[[Tracing|borrowed]]" from [[Final Fantasy 7]].  Some soldiers go to shitty state colleges and join up to pay for the privilege, while [[fucktards|snotty rich assholes]] go to [[college|top colleges]] where they [[retard|get drunk and high every day]] and sometimes [[protest]] wars [[lemonparty|that they don't have to fight in by virtue of their being too rich to have to pay for college with military service]].

Many people in the Southern states of the USA own guns because the [[American]] Constitution says that they can form militias in the event of a home game. Hardcore soldiers regard these people as total [[n00b]]s.

===Nigras In The Army===
As of [[last Thursday]], [[Fact|the Army is approximately 32 percent black]], compared to [[RL]]'s 9 percent.  The Army can now steal Iraqi bikes and [[Pools Closed|close pools]] with greater efficiency than [[evar]] before, thanks to [[HUEG|h00j]] enlistment bonuses having lured plenty of nigras.  Soldiers' clothing stipends are being increased to accommodate the transition from ACU to the three-piece suit, and regulations now permit the afro in lieu of [[gay|high-and-tight]].

===Women in the Army===
There's a huge lack of females in the army, because they avoid such hazardous work like the plague due to their princess mentality and endless list of entitlements. Women are too pussyfied and afraid to risk their lives in warfare. Upon any attempt to become "the real American hero", the woman will be dragged from the battle field and savagely raped, both anally and orally, I.E: Jessica Lynch.

The tiny amount of female soldiers pretend to be tough until they're sent to the [[battlefield]]. That's when they fabricate excuses to stay safe at home. 

Some are in the army for comfort, and because soldiers need to eat, [[Kitchen|women play an important role in the Army.]]
