==Loser nerds playing shitty games together makes you stupid.==
Imagine if you will the [[goon|Goons]] of [[Something Awful]] coming together to play online games in a clan-like fashion. Yes, it makes me sad inside too. 

This is in essence the [[Something Awful]] forums in game form, with just as much [[faggotry]] and [[old meme|painfully old memes]] being thrown around as you'd expect to find in the forums at any given time. In order to join a goon squad for any given game, it is a necessity that you are a goon, and sufficiently [[gay|pro]] at the game in question. The largest of the squads base themselves around [[shit|really great games]], where in they make it their goal to ruin the game for all the other [[geek|geeks]] playing it, and often abuse the game mechanics because of their large numbers to become very powerful. 

It is ironic that this power comes with the fact that said [[Goon|Goons]] remain [[Goon|Goons]] and still wont ever get [[sex|laid]].

Also sauce of epic [[butthurt]]. Dubbed as "[http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/01/something-awful/ virtual terrorists]" who assault people with pink penises, [http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2006/12/the_great_goon_/ kidnap people], [http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/16-02/mf_goons?currentPage=1 kill their own mascot and furries] and [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/89219-More-EVE-Online-Shenanigans-GoonSwarm-Ganks-Band-Of-Brothers fuck the whole shit up]. Business as usual. Still not getting laid.
