SPH
[[File:Disney Sex Doll.jpg|thumb|120px|Your [[cumdumpster|date]] for tonight.]]
'''SPH''' stands for ''Strategically Placed Hole'' and is a reference to the fuckholes that furfags into [[Plushophilia]] make in their stuffed animals so that they can anally violate them. [[Gay|Those who]] would rather have a dick [[In the ass|up their ass]], strap a "[[dildo|Strategically Placed Appendage]]" to their dolls and go to town.

That's right: these "[[Plushophilia|stuffed animal lovers]]" are ripping up, mangling, covering with cum, and otherwise destroying the stuffed animals they "love". Why? Because they are [[sick fucks]] nobody else in the world [[dying alone|would ever even consider fuckable]] and they have [[otherkin|mental illnesses]] that make them think that a [[plushie|stuffed animal]] is a good substitute for a [[woman|living human being]].

Now, because we can't be arsed to think any more about the deranged subject at hand, we'll let one of the [[Sick Fuck]]s [http://www.velocity.net/~galen/psexfaq.html speak for us]. 

==How does one have sex with a plushie?==
[[File:Stuffed raccoon.gif|frame|"[[Sick Fuck|a romantic, erotic act]]"]]
[[masturbate|Mostly we teach ourselves]]. Myself, I discovered plush sex long before [[dying alone|I knew there was another adult in the world]] who [[raep|loved]] stuffed animals as I did. I just cuddled and slept with my [[abuse|special plushie]], and being a [[no|normal man]], my body could not help but show my feelings. 

At first I resisted, because I regarded my love for my plushies as [[pope|purely innocent]], but I came to realize that [[sick fuck|consummating that love]] was [[no|innocent, too]], and [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|completely natural]]. It was a [[Sick Fuck|feeling I just could not deny]], nor [[insane|feel ashamed of in any way]].

Stroking a plushie over [[penis|any sensitive part of ones body]] is another [[sick fuck|nice way to achieve arousal]]. Some of us have such strong feelings for plushies that we can make ourselves [[cum|peak]] just by [[WTF|looking at them]], or just [[wtf|sniffing their scent]]. We tend to modify our plushies for sex, too.

[[WTF|Many other fetishes can easily be combined with plush sex, as well]]. [[Yiff|Indulge freely in your fancies]]! 

===Should I 'go all the way' with my plushies? ?===
I do! To me, giving my gift of [[cock|love]] to my plushies is a sacramental act. However, unless you like your partners to be [[cum|spoogey]] ([[sick fuck|which some of us do]]), be aware that semen or vaginal fluid can mar their fur if left to dry untreated. If this concerns you, be sure to [[furshampoo|comb and dry]] the fur thoroughly right after [[yiffing|sex]], and untangle all the stuck-together plush. Because even simple cuddling will wear out a plushie over time, though, I always try to buy at least two of a stuffed animal that I know I couldn't live without. That way, I can [[rape|love one without any inhibition]], and still have a new one if/when the time comes to retire the first.
