'''Kim Petras''' (formerly Tim Petras) is an [[Lie|aspiring]] 17-year-old [[poop|pop]] singer. He is most famous for having been one of the youngest individuals ever to become a [[MTF]] [[transexual]] at the [[shota|young]], [[loli|young]] age of [[12]]. He makes his humble abode in [[WHARRGARBL|Nordrhein-Westfalen]], [[Germany]]. 

He's basically an [[IRL]] [[Bridget]].

== Gender Reassignment ==

According to [[German]] [[law]], one must be eighteen years of age to undergo Gender Reassignment Surgery.  At age [[12|twelve]], Tim began taking hormone treatments to prepare for his gender transition. At [[13-year-old boy|age thirteen]], he appeared on German television to plead for permission to undergo the final Gender Reassignment Surgery.  Somehow, the [[Nazis|citizens of Germany]] were on board to support the thirteen-year-old boy who wanted to be a girl.  He claims that he was "born a girl."  Apparently, he looked like a girl, even before he had [[tits]] and was quite obviously [[gay]] before the surgery.

According to his parents, he had been [[delusional|insisting that he was a girl]] since age two.  Mr. and Mrs. Petras, realizing they had given birth to an abomination, struggled to find a [[psychiatrist]] who could offer an iota of assistance to their precious child.  After a long and stressful hunt, the Petras family finally found Dr. Bernd Meyenburg, a child's psychiatrist who had extensive experience with [[faggotry|transsexuality]].  Finally, his parents held hope that their little boy was going to be okay.  No more [[lulz|gender confusion]], no more talk of [[kitchen|being a woman]], just a normal little Timothy Petras.  However, [[Fail|we all know how that turned out]].


Now "she" stands proudly as the [[Attention Whore|youngest transsexual in the world]]. God speed, Kim. God speed. Also, [[die in a fire]], you [[gender bender|gender bending]] [[faggot]].

== Pre-pubescent He/She ==
A little known fact about Kim/Tim is that he never actually went through puberty, which kind of explains why he's such a fag in the first place (despite the fact he's been a homo since age 2 according to his folks).  The only reason he came out as a smokin' hot post-op was the fact that he had taken hormone blocking drugs since before his teens, and therefore never went through the puberty and never became a man (or a woman, as they have puberty too, herpderp). Hence the reason he lacks a deep voice, masculine body, and a stubble, unlike most queers who get turned into women.

== His Shitty Music==

Unfortunately for him, he produces the kind of [[music]] only a [[gay]] German boy would like- mostly [[pop]] and [[techno]]. 

Here are some examples of the [[shit|music]] that spews out of <s>his</s> <s>her</s> his mouth.
