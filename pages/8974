What-EVER
Phrase used primarily in the everyday speech of the southern Californian [[Slut|Valley Girl]].

It generally implies a casual nonchalance about a situation, or a blatant dismissal.

'''Person 1:''' ''Your boyfriend slept with my sister!''

'''Valley girl:''' ''What-EVER''.

The phrase is also one of many less-than-intellectual phrases co-opted by [[gay]] "culture."  (see also: [[Jar Jar Binks|"how wude!"]])
