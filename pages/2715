[[Essjay]] is a 24-year-old shady motherfucker. He claims that his username is derived from his initials S.J. but elsewhere Essjay says his name is '''[[PowerWord: IRL Name|Ryan Jordan]]'''. Ah well, he's probably lying about that, too. His tall-tales make him a man of mystery&mdash;but like all [[TOW]] [[furry|contributors]] he is a [[nobody]] who just wants [[attention]]. Essjay's main claims to fame are lying to ''The New Yorker'' and getting [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&diff=111592174&oldid=111562387 trolled] by Daniel Brandt.

He also is [[John Titor|from the future]], was born in Antarctica, has been abducted by aliens, and toured their home world to make friends with their leader. 
Like most dual-PhD-millionaire-theologist-lawyer-saint-technophiles, he spends '''[[Basement-dweller|16 hours a day]]''' editing [[TOW]].
Of course editing under the dual-PhD account was not enough; after some time he started spamming various academics, proselytizing the greatness of Wikipedia.

==[[Ruination|Caught!]] The Great Essjay Drama of 2007==
Thanks to [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=2778&st=0 countless hours] of  [[e-detective]] work by Daniel Brandt, Essjay was [[Dramouted|finally exposed]] as the fraud he truly is. Unsurprisingly, and perhaps like your average [[Wikipedia Admin Gallery|Wikipedia Admin]], he is 24 years old and possesses absolutely no PhDs.

<br/>
{{quote|Essjay claimed two PhDs and a tenured faculty position on his Wikipedia user page. This was repeated in The New Yorker. It was all bogus.|Wikipedia-Watch}}

After he was caught [http://www.webpronews.com/blogtalk/2007/03/01/the-wikipedia-admin-brouhaha lying] about his [http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2007/02/new-yorker-butchered-facts-in-wikipedia-ode.php credentials] and [http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/10092/53/ publicly] [http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=37939 embarrassing] [[TOW]], Essjay stated that he viewed his actions without regret or remorse. It was all an elaborate ruse to confuse stalkers and vandals. <s>Glad that really worked. </s> Oh, wait he got his shit ruined by Brandt. Curiously enough Essjay chose to be an [[Intellectual|overeducated professor]] with several degrees instead of a mailman, truck driver or other stalker-proof job, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Imprimatur&diff=prev&oldid=12614544 i.e. chose to claim to have something that takes years of hard work and thousands of dollars to earn.] Gullible Wikipedia editors naively believed that nobody would go so low as to state ''[[Lie|"This is a text '''''I often require for my students''''', and '''''I would hang my own Ph.D.''''' on it's credibility"]]'' in defense of the book, "Catholicism for Dummies." Maybe it had something to do with enhancing his [[e-penis]].

Now with nothing left to lose and no longer afraid of stalkers, Essjay posted the next bunch of lies on his userpage, claiming that "Before joining [[Wikia]], I was an account manager with a Fortune 20 company. Prior to that, I was a [[E-lawyer|paralegal]] for five years, including a three-month special position with a United States Trustee and nearly two years freelance, handling special projects." Yeah right, you lying scum, disproven by math you don't need a PhD for.

Essjay says his "Ryan Jordan" persona is 24. 24 minus 5 is 19. 19 minus two is 17. So at 17 years old he is working as a freelancer handling "special projects" for a United States trustee (whatever one of those is). Essjay could even be claiming that this was the case at age 15 or 16, depending on how long he's trying to claim that he worked as an account manager. Even if those two years were simultaneous with part of the five, Essjay would've only been 19. 

Totally without credibility. What wonders did he achieve [[13-year-old boy|aged 12]]? 
[[Image:Essjay-Everytime.png|right|thumb|[[Irony]] anyone?]]
His local paper, the Louisville Courier-Journal, found out [[Essjay/Courier-Journal|that the whole story was a crock of turds]]; the US Trustees have no recollection of "Ryan." Worse yet, they found out that he's a repeat dropout who has never graduated from anything more than (possibly) high school. Somebody in [[Kentucky]] does remember him, though: the lawyer who hired Essjay to be his [[Fellatio|secretary]] for 6 months.

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">J. Fox DeMoisey, a lawyer who represents doctors in licensure cases, said Jordan had worked in his office for about six months as a secretary and receptionist.</blockquote>

Of course, Essjay initially refused to resign from any of his positions (which include [[TL;DR|admin/checkuser/oversight/bureaucrat/arbitrator/creep]]/[[Rimjob|overseeing the cleaning of Jimbo's ass]]) despite [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&direction=next&oldid=112024555#New_Yorker_article the demands] of [[At least 100|thousands]] of editors. In a miracle of the [[Bureaucratic Fuck|wikipedoes]], various people are still being banned for criticizing the bastard.

Beyond contempt.

[[Image:Catholicism for dummies.jpg|thumb|The sum total of Essjay's knowledge]]
He would then claim that the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist that interviewed him offered him money for his interview.[http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2007/03/03/essjays-third-transgression/]

Essjay, as a tenured professor and Wikipedia editor (or is that Wikipedia professor and tenured editor?), had no time for people who claimed dubious credentials. Back in 2005, Essjay initiated an [[Internet court|ArbCom]] case against Rainbowwarrior1977 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rainbowwarrior1977] and complained that Rainbow was falsely claiming to be a lawyer with a law degree from NYU. The ArbComm duly ruled that "All good-faith contributors, even anonymous ones, are welcome to edit and become involved in the community. However, all users are expected not to misrepresent themselves or their edits, especially as they pertain to claiming to have qualifications that one does not have. Passed 5-0."[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rainbowwarrior1977#Misrepresentation.2Fhonesty] A strange feeling must have overcome Essjay when he read that, a twinge of conscious guilt that he the accuser was really no better than the accused, just a despicable fraud, a fake ... nah, Essjay read that, felt smug about shafting another poor bugger and laughed maniacally at his own hubris.

==Gay?==
As part of his [[fucktard|protective cloak]], Essjay claimed to be not only a [[Catholic]] academic, but a male [[homosexual]] Catholic academic, figuring that this would trump any and all critics by smearing them as [[Republican|fascist mother-fucking haters!]] So, he created this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Robbie31 sock puppet] to be his [[Pig bottom|bottom]], or vice versa. The puppetry was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Robbie31 absolutely transparent]; the only real contribution made by "Robbie31" was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Robbie31 to vote for Essjay] to be a [[Bureaucratic Fuck|ToW bureaucrat]]. 
[[Image:Wikibadge.jpg|left|thumb|Essjay puts something up his arse, pretends it's some shitty award, and faps over his imaginary gaaay lover, Robbie31]]

Talk about single-purpose accounts! Apparently "Ryan" has admitted that the account was a puppet, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Robbie31&oldid=112764683 the fact is well-known] on ToW, but considered to be still "deniable."

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">EssJay has always been, and still is, a fantastic editor and trusted member of the community. He apologized to me and to the community for any harm caused. Trolls are claiming that he "bragged" about it: this is bullshit. He has been thoughtful and contrite about the entire matter and I consider it settled.[http://www.webcitation.org/5N6jk4kju]</blockquote>

==[[Jimbo]] Doubles back==
[[Image:Jimbolir.jpg|right|thumb|Jimbo, Essjay's erstwhile patron, gleefully realizes the boy's got to go.]]

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
<p>I have been for several days in a remote part of [[India]] with little or no Internet access. I only learned this morning that EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes. I understood this to be primarily the matter of a pseudonymous identity (something very mild and completely understandable given the personal dangers possible on the Internet) and not a matter of violation of people's trust. I want to make it perfectly clear that my past support of EssJay in this matter was fully based on a lack of knowledge about what has been going on. Even now, I have not been able to check diffs, etc.</p>

<p>I have asked EssJay to resign his positions of trust within the community. In terms of the full parameters of what happens next, I advise (as usual) that we take a calm, loving, and reasonable approach. From the moment this whole thing became known, EssJay has been contrite and apologetic. People who characterize him as being "proud" of it or "bragging" are badly mistaken.</p>

<p>On a personal level, EssJay has apologized to me, and I have accepted his apology on a personal level, and I think this is the right thing to do. If anyone else feels that they need or want a personal apology, please ask him for it. And if you find it to be sincere, then I hope you will accept it too, but each person must make their own judgments. Despite my personal forgiveness, I hope that he will accept my resignation request, because forgiveness or not, these positions are not appropriate for him now.</p>

<p>I still have limited net access... for a couple of hours here I will be online, and then I am offline until I am in Japan tomorrow morning. I beleive I will have a fast and stable Internet connection at that time, and I will deal with this further at that time.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is built on (among other things) twin pillars of trust and tolerance. The integrity of the project depends on the core community being passionate about quality and integrity, so that we can trust each other. The harmony of our work depends on human understanding and forgiveness of errors.</p>

<p>My comments here will be short and to the point: I'm no longer taking part here. I have received an astounding amount of support, especially by email, but it's time to go. I tried to walk away in August, and managed to do so for quite a while, but I eventually came back, because of the many requests I received urging me to return. Many of you have written to ask me to not leave, to not give up what I have here, but I'm afraid it's time to make a clean break.</p>

<p>I ask that the first steward to see this message please remove my various flags from this wiki, as well as from Meta, Commons, and Wikiquote, and remove the bot flags from my bots, which of course will no longer be running. My tools will be taken down shortly. I had planned to delete my user-space myself, but I don't want anyone to think I was going on a rampage, so instead, I ask that one or more administrators who are friends please delete the 288 pages that form my userspace (leaving only my userpage and this talk page).</p>

<p>I've enjoyed my time here, and done much good work; my time, however, is over, and leaving is the best thing for me and for Wikipedia. I walk away happy to be free to go about other things. I hope others will refocus the energy they have spent the past few days in defending and denouncing me to make something here at Wikipedia better.</p>

Done much good work? What a two-faced fuckup. Damn how much of an ego does he have to try and pull some stupid shit like that?  And in an astonishingly clear display of the [[hivemind]] at work, nearly all the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Essjay&oldid=112886626 comments] that survived edit warring on Essjay's talk page were of the form "noooo! please don't go!!!1" and "you'll be feeling better soon" (wtf?) and various [[barnstar]]s.  What remained of Essjay's talk page before it was blanked and protected carried an eerie similarity to the comment pages of [[MySpace]] [[Internet_killers|killers]].

I'm still [[retarded|in complete and utter shock]]. This is a travesty of unparalleled proportions.

Essjay was a [[luser|good guy]] who did [[Lie|unmeasurable good work here for a period of years]]. He really didn't deserve this. Many of us severely overreacted, and [[BAWWWWW|it's costing us now]].

Further resume shadiness (see his old Wikia page in the gallery): When adding up his occupations and subtracting the total years from his posted age of 24, Essjay has been working for  large corporations since he was 14?  Note how he claims he went directly from doing "freelance special projects for several firms", which is bullshit-speak for being a fucking temp, to managing a staff which did '''half a billion dollars''' in annual sales. In other words, he expects us to believe that a Fortune-20 company hired a paralegal (who couldn't even hold down a steady job) to oversee a huge chunk of its annual revenue, while he was ''simultaneously'' editing Wikipedia for like 60 hours a week. [[Citation needed]], bitch.

On March 2nd, just when the drama really started producing good [[lulz]], a [[sockpuppet]] called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/QuiTacetConsentiret QuiTacetConsentiret] started a TOW article about Essjay which sent the lulz [[over nine thousand]]. The article was page moved a bunch of times before briefly coming to rest at the [[Unwarranted self-importance|overly self-important]] title [[Wikipedia:Essjay scandal]], is currently at [[Wikipedia:Essjay controversy]], and will no doubt be moved a few more times in the next day or so. The article was also immediately nominated for baleetion by [[bureaucratic fuck|PTO]]. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Essjay enormous ensuing debate] between Essjay's sycophantic band of cockfags and everyone else on TOW is replete with [[faggotry]] and lulz.
