Alexander James, known as '''MadManNES''' on [[DeviantArt]], is your typical 13 year old Deviantartlet who likes [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] and Doom and spends most of his time trolling [[jailbaitgallery.com]]. Sounds innocent enough, right? Of course, there are fags like this all over the internet, what makes MadMan any different? Let us delve deeper into his mind, shall we?

== Victim Complex ==

[[File:How Alex feels now by madmanNES.jpg|thumb|left|This is pretty much how he sees every single troll attack on him.]]
MadManNES suffers from a severe case of [[victim complex]]. He claims that the trolls pick on him for no other reason than the fact he likes Sonic the Hedgehog and Doom. Anyone above the age of 8 can figure out that he is made fun of for being severely [[butthurt]] over the slightest negative comment. Often in his journals, he treats the DeviantArt website as if it was a person, calling it such things as an "ungrateful bastard" for not banning anyone who makes the slightest negative comment against him. He also will constantly tell people that if they don't help them, you are a sick person that loves [[trolls]].

== Anger Issues and Obsession ==

[[File:Reag.PNG|thumb|He'll fucking kill you, you porn intrest.]]
The main reason trolls are drawn to flock at this tartlet is simply because of how effortless and simple it is to push his buttons to make him rage about you. It's very easy to just spam "this is gay" on one of his pictures and expect a [[CAPS LOCK]] rage reply followed by a journal about you telling you how much of a bastard you are.

If you keep it up, he'll show you being killed Doom-style in some artwork! This is probably the most lulzy and glorious stage a troll can get with him.

MadMan also has several likes and dislikes, to which he takes obsessively. Any normal person that didn't like Ben 10 would just say "that's gay" and change the channel. However, Alexander in his potentially autistic mind, must make it his God-given mission to "kill" Ben 10. How would he do it? By spamming Cartoon Network's feedback system to tell them how horrible the show is. Being oblivious to how contracts work, he wants Cartoon Network to know exactly how to run their own business that has been going good for years. Run it into the ground, of course.

His main lover in the world is no other than Sonic the Hedgehog. Again, he must take his like to the obsession, drawing pictures of him "cuddling" with his buddy to taking grainy webcam pictures of his Sonic plushie commenting on how "cute" he is. He will also openly admit in the comments that Sonic is his "best friend". We shit you not.

He has recently also discovered how to block people from having anything to do with his account, if you consider this a threat, make a lot more accounts and before you flame tell him you have more. Otherwise you'll never get at him ever again. Also tell him that you cannot get arrested for making art. His male PMS will kick in, and he will CAPS RAEG at you and block you. Thinking he has won.

== "Art" ==

Perhaps the other main reason he is a troll target is his art. Before trolls came into his life, his DeviantArt was just filled with shitty pictures made in [[MSPaint]] for his Megaman "fangame" and several wonderful pictures depicting his favorite butt-buddy Ben 10 getting shot. After the trolls, his art mainly focused around "getting revenge" on those evil trolls, which in fact did the exact opposite. The trolls turned it into a game: who can piss MadManNES off the most and get the newest hateart? Examples of his high-quality work is seen below.

== The Trolls ==

[[File:He really is this stupid.PNG|thumb|Words fail me.]]
Perhaps the key part in making all this were several trolls who stuck by MadMan's side when he threatened to leave DeviantArt for the 5th time in a month. Perhaps the biggest trolling occurred when he was so gullible he actually believed that 3 sixty-something British musicians were willing to help him out of the blue fight off these trolls. A troll in the disguise of Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, and Rod Stewart started a DeviantArt group to give him the false impression that people were actually by his side. The most damning thing about this is after the troll confessed to being these people, he still believed Jeff Lynne (the troll) was telling the truth. His gullibility almost rivals that of [[Chris-Chan]].
He also thinks that by making a second account that he can [http://img63.imageshack.us/i/madmanfail.png/ AVOID TEH TROLLS]

== Videos ==

Besides plaguing DeviantArt, MadManNES has also had his fair share of YouTube videos. Here is the best of the best. Note: some were reuploaded due to a delete everything move on his part.

== FanArt ==

FanArt MadManNES has received....zero. So instead, let's show some super kawaii art the trolls have made.

== Future Fears ==
As he has become more and more mad, he started to develop the deadly disease known as 'butthurt'. A group of troll scientists have been researching this virus, and they said the outcome could be terrible. If the butthurt virus keeps growing and growing, they fear that this could cause a 12 year old apocalypse. Of course, these trolls (known as Cybernick, Random Guy, Scarfermezzo, ima 'dutch bag amy' kid, ect.) have been given a jab, making them immune from the butthurt. They might be the only survivors, and the won't survive for long if this virus gets out of hand! Please help us cure this butthurt virus, a little thing you can do to help is tell him that he is butthurt so he knows to fight the virus, or maybe make his madness take over the virus. You can help by simply posting a comment on one the links below:
