'''Sex by association''' is an [[internet disease]] technique extensively exploited in [[cosplay]]. Like [[alcohol]] and [[drugs]], costumes impair the human mind and make [[sex]] seem exciting and worthwhile with [[ugly]] [[fat]] freaks you would normally avoid. In the old days dressing up was reserved for Halloween and naughty role-playing sessions. Today, thousands of nerds [[parade]] through [[convention]]s  dressed as [[anime]], comic book and [[movie]] characters using their costumes the same way frat boys use roofies.

== Technique ==
'''HOW TO DO IT'''
*The process begins by selecting the costume of a hot, large-breasted female character from an anime, movie, comic book or game. 
*The cosplayer then makes a homemade version of this costume out of brightly colored bedsheets, duct tape and cardboard that will resemble a [[hippie]] after a brutal mauling by polar bears rather than the original costume. 
*The cosplayer then pours themselves into their abomination (costume) and may choose to add a wig and tin foil accessories.
*Wear it to a convention or post pictures on the [[internets]] to lure in unsuspecting nerds. Most cosplayers do both to get attention of more [[virgins|fans]].

'''HOW IT WORKS'''
*Although cosplayers are typically the exact opposite of the fictional voluptuous vixen, the visually dependent mind of [[male]] nerds is short-circuted by this optical illusion and [[I accidentally X|accidentally]] re-allocates sexiness from the character to the cosplayer. 
*Depending on the con being attended and the character selected, the power of sex by association will vary.

== Example ==

*''[[Mary Sue]] attends an Anime Con dressed as Cat Woman: +1000 sex appeal.

'''Mary Sue will have to be mildly attractive or she will not be [[fuck]]ed.'''''

*''Mary Sue attends a Comic Book Convention dressed as Cat Woman: +5000 sex appeal.

'''Mary Sue could be plain and still get fucked.'''''

*''Mary Sue attends a bar near the comic book convention dressed as Cat Woman and her date drinks 10 beers: +20,000 sex appeal.''

'''Mary Sue could be an obese gorilla that escaped from the zoo or [[Girlmecha]] and still get fucked.'''

It should be noted that Cat Woman is possibly the sexiest costume a cosplayer could chose as it appeals to comic book nerds, anime nerds and [[furries]], while Cat Girls only appeal to anime nerds and furries, and Miss Piggy only appeals to furries.
