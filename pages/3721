Hirsute
{{crap}}
Covered in hair&mdash;literally "bearlike" (compare "bovine", [[cow]]like; "hircine", goatlike). Not just the chest, or armpit hair or anything overgrown. The whole body. They'd have to be pretty damn hairy to be considered hirsute.

Usage: yo, ninjamonkee123, joe mama is one hirstute [[fatty]] bizzle, she's so hairy, she can grow corn in that field - if the damn crabs didn't eat it.

'''Hirsute''' is [[not be confused with|not to be confused with]] a [[fursuit]].
