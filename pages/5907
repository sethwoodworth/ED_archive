OMGWTFBBQCATS
[[Image:Eatcatsbutton.jpg|left|cheap buttons]][[Image:Bbqcathatesyou.gif|right|BBQ cat hates!]] OMGWTFBBQCATS? you can ask yourself as the [[Peta#PETA|PETA]] did on their forums when one of their petaspawns took a break from [[Cutting|cutting]] herself and posted a link, afraid that her happy [[Cat|housecat]] would be devoured by these rabid anti-furry cat-eaters. A lot like people with teddybears fear the [[Furry|furries]]. The petaspawn went on to report the site to every possible authority, with no luck, since eating cat is legal. 

A group of [[Friends|friends]] put up the crapstub [http://bbqcats.mine.nu/ OMGWTFBBQCATS?] site to make [[Money|the cash]]. They write that they will eat cat on midsummer 2008 unless they make [[Cat#Killing_Cats_for_Fun_and_Profit|enough money]] from the site to pay for a hooker, or any other sort of steak to eat. This is bad for the cats though, because these [[Mega_ultra_super_genius|MUSG]]s want to capitalize on the [[I_Can_Has_Cheezburger%3F|lolcat]] hating and put up a place to vote for eating the felines as well, and the eat the cats voting side got all the [[Kewlies|kewl]] swag, like the BBQ apron with cat recipy on and the cheap buttons.
