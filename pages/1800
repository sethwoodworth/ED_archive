[[TOW]] takes their vandalism [[srsly]] [[srsly|seriously]].

==Wikipedia's fun, fantastic game==
It is a [[common knowledge|well known fact]] that the wikipedo circle jerk ph33rs vandalism in any way, shape or form. [[Mega ultra super genius|I]] mean, it's safe to assume that your average [[Nathanr|Wikipedian]] beats off to screenshots of the newest version of [[VandalProof]] in the heat of the battle, crushing [[IP|anonymous editors]] indiscriminately and laying down the law with their shitty, ineffective warning [[template]]s. However, that cum-guzzling faggot [[Essjay]] decided to take this fantasy, played out many a time, to the next [[gay|level]] by creating a '''whole fucking wiki''' devoted to eliminating vandalism from [[Wikipedia|Wikikepedia]]. However, they don't actually ''do anything'' to stop vandalism. It's like an internet version of the kids game, Cowboys and Indians.

In reality, the whole thing is just another wikipedia [[circle jerk]], much like [[Esperanza]] but with 100% more bureaucratic fuckery, and is aligned with the cabal. The whole wiki is off-limits, due to closed registration - I'm sure vandalising a counter-vandalism wiki would be pretty fucking lol, though.

==Essjay is a powerwhore==
Essjay rules his shitty little wiki like an e-[[Saddam]]. He doesn't let anyone in, anyone out, and you have to report any change you make to the privs on the wiki, or their irc channels - if you fail to do so, Jew and [[NEDM|set kittens on fire]].

He's also terribly paranoid. For example, on countervandalism.org, he's introduced a system involving ''trusted users'', an utterly useless privilege level he gives to users who display enough of that Wikipedia Hivemind Mentality<sup>TM</sup> to satisfy him. He also hands out this priv rather erratically - some of Wikipedia's sysops, who are also #wikipedia chanops, are yet to attain the ''trusted'' level.
