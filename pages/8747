'''VampirePosers.com''' is an internet website dedicated to [[goth]]s, [[Vampire]]s and [[cosplay]] scenes. The premise of the site is pretty basic. Registered users of the site upload images of varying categories into photo albums. Then the owner of the site, {{lj|user=vampireposer}}, [[whore]]s, [[spam]]s and whines his way through other [[site]]s until people link to his.

This cunning plan seems less than successful: [[forum]] [[comment]]s at vampireposers.com run from zero to two, with few comments on the photos.

While the [http://www.vampireposers.com photo album] is [[lulz]]ful, promises by the site owner of exciting [[drama]] from [[troll]]s, and suicidal [[goth]]s and [[emo]]s are false. This is because [[goth]]s and [[emo]]s are incapable of experiencing any emotion other than [[angst]].
