'''''MDK''''' is probably the most [[WTF|surreal]] [[FPS|third/first person-shooter]] series to ever exist. There are two games in the series, ''MDK'' (1997) and ''MDK2'' (2000) - with a HD version of the sequel in [[2011]]. The first game is more like an absurd sci-fi movie and the sequel has very "[[I'm so random]]"-type humor.

==Storyline==
<video type="youtube" id="SuqCHPiQuqw" width="200" height="150" desc="The biggest [[troll|FUCK YOU]] of the decade, followed by ''[[Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt]]'''s ending in 2010." frame="true" position="right"/>
*'''''MDK'':''' HOLY SHIT THE EARTH IS BEING ATTACKED BY ALIEN TANKS! Kurt has to save it. Before we can tell you that story, we have to tell you ''this'' story. The game's [[Hotel Mario|instruction book]] is styled in the journal of Dr. Hawkins, who mentions discovering "Flange Orbits." When he tells the rest of the scientific community, they're like "[[LOL]] [[OH WOW]] you're a faggot!" so he essentially exiles himself out of shame. The world got attacked by some [[you|gross]] [[alien]]s and he tried to warn Earth (and also sent down oranges) but [[nobody cares|nobody cared]]. So then Kurt had to like destroy the minecrawler tanks that the aliens were using to destroy Earth, and he assassinated [[Cunt|Gunt]]er [[Slut|Glut]], the aliens' leader. 

*'''''MDK 2: Armageddon'':''' HOLY SHIT [[Canada|CANADA]] IS BEING ATTACKED BY A REMAINING ALIEN TANK! For some reason, Max, Dr. Hawkins, and Kurt actually give a shit and go to stop it even though most people wouldn't really bother saving Edmonton from aliens. But even after each of the three [[douchebag]]s try to attempt any progress in their mission, they keep getting kidnapped by the aliens, requiring each one to save each other. They find out the attacks were really by some guy called Emperor [[What|Zizzy Ballooba]] who literally says he attacked Earth [[for the lulz]]. After the Emperor is blown the fuck up, Max takes his throne, Kurt resumes cleaning [[shit|toilets]], and Dr. Hawkins returns to Earth, still a [[schizophrenic|madman]].

==Characters==
<video type="youtube" id="dvBWKEUDH_Q" width="200" height="150" desc="ATOMIC ROBOT ZOMBIEMEN!" frame="true" position="right"/>

*'''[[Human|Kurt Hectic]]''': Some janitor who wants to live a [[typical|normal, everyday life]] being a janitor. He was bribed with [[food|goulash]] (no seriously) to be the doctor's test subject for some pointy-looking goth sniper-suit, since Max couldn't wear it since he was a dog, and the doctor was too old to put it on. He saved [[California|Laguna Beach]] from [[alien]]s. He doesn't want to be a celebrity and actually doesn't have any [[unwarranted self-importance]] at all so we should all be more like Kurt. *[[You|HINT, HINT.]]*

*'''[[Cool|Max]]''': Originally called "Bones" but he prefers "Max" because it doesn't sound as stupid. Max is a [[dog]] that has six legs. The first two pairs act as "arms" and he can shoot [[guns]]. [[Deal with it|He smokes and he drinks because he doesn't give a fuck.]] However any amount of coolness he has is stripped away because he is a [[furfag]]. He is captured by the final boss, Glut, in the first game, but Kurt saves him... and then suddenly [[French|Billy Ze Kick]]. The original [[Deal with it]] dog.

*'''[[Batshit insane|Dr. Hawkins]]''': A scientist who exiled himself because he wanted to make dumb shit in outer space aboard the ''Jim Dandy''. He fights using [[unfunny|radioactive toast]]. Really. Also when he helps save Earth, people welcome him back only to find out that yes, he is a [[Lemonparty|crazy old man and you should avoid him]].

==THE SOUNDTRACK [[Yes|(WHICH IS FUCKING AWESOME)]]==
[[File:Mdk2-max.jpg|thumb|right|[[Deal with it]].]]
Holy shit, the soundtrack for these games are the coolest things ever, and if you don't agree then you're a fucking faggot or [[Nope|deaf]]. Raymond Watts of the band [[KMFDM|Pig]] did a track on ''MDK2'' so you know it's great. If you say otherwise then fucking huff rocket fuel you bitch. In fact that's why this article is made.

==Fans==
''MDK'''s [[CWC|fandase]] is actually pretty reserved but seeing as Max is a [[dog]] then you know some [[furries]] are gonna be up all in that shit.

===Non Non Rien N'a Changé and Trolling===
As mentioned before, the ending to ''MDK'' pissed off (and simultaneously amused) gamers because who the fuck would expect random French [[stoner]] pop? Some whined that "THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT ENDING IT'S NOT [[Canon|CANON]] ARGHGHHAHABLBLE" while ripping out tiny hairs from their [[neckbeard]]s, not realizing they're bitching about the ending to a game where there is a six-legged dog smoking cigars. 

<center>{{frame|{{morphquote|nonnonriennachange|background-color: #EBC600;|font-weight: bold;
|Ending is classic, but i hated it. This is the game﻿ where i wanted an EPIC ending! Epic ending for an epic game. No fucking way...|T0mFrame got trolled by Shiny.
|i was so sad when i ended this game, it was the best game i ever enjoyed.﻿ So original, and great ending, with this european singer. Oh great memories...|Camilo21986 on YouTube, what the hell?
|Is anyone reminded of the ending of the Band Geeks episode﻿ of Spongebob?|andStack on YouTube;
|I'm not sure what gender that person singing is, but I'd hit it either way.﻿|GeneralFatman27 - don't worry, Nathalie Cousin is female!
|wowowowowowowowo in 2.00 its says mexican while singin﻿|mexicanboy69 - no it doesn't, what?}}|color=#519ED9}}</center>


[[Steam]] users can't see this ending because the retards there distributed it as a Direct3D version, which means it's suitable for computers from like 1997 but sure as hell not today.

{{quote|"I just bought MDK from the 'steam' gaming community network and the game runs so﻿ poorly that it's all but unplayable, how can a 12 year old game be re released incompatible with current machines. Has anyone had the same drama and if so found a solution?|Xyrophile, lol Direct3D}}

After all...

===2011 HD Remakes, and Reactions===
[[File:Kurt_from_behind.JPG|thumb|right|[[DAT ASS]].]]
[http://www.1up.com/news/mdk-2-remake-announced-wii In mid-2010, ''MDK2'' was announced to be having a HD remake for 2011.] It will be for the [[Wii]] and the [[PC]]. Fans were surprised that HOLY SHIT PC GAMING IS ACTUALLY REGARDED!

Naturally, retards who [[nostalgia|are all nostalgic with fucking everything]] came out at [[Applemilk|full force]]. 
More fans whined about no PSN/XBLA as well. Look at this idiot:

{{quote|Give discounts to those of us who still have our MDK 1 and 2 CDs.|willyyum from 1up.com, on being incredibly, incredibly [[unrealistic expectations|unrealistic]];}}

He's probably going to [[torrent]] it anyway.

===[[Fan Art]]===
The series doesn't have a lot of fan art compared to, say, ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' - but if there's fan art, there's faggotry:
