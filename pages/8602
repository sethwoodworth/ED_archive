[19:37] <MrSix> Sup
[19:38] <%NOTHALCYON> Hello
[19:38] <MrSix> I'm here to talk about the Two Worlds article
[19:38] <%NOTHALCYON> Yes
[19:38] <%NOTHALCYON> I know
[19:38] <MrSix> Right
[19:38] <MrSix> Well
�01[19:38] <TrainOfThought> We know
[19:38] <MrSix> Can you revert to my edits?
�03[19:38] * Hugo_Stiglitz (Mibbit@l0ld0ngs-DCA8DB7E.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined #wiki
[19:38] <Hugo_Stiglitz> what
[19:38] <Hugo_Stiglitz> do you want train
[19:38] <MrSix> Like I said, I understand about the lulz and all...I, too, used to be a Channer. Once. And a goon. I'm from the Internet.
[19:39] <Hugo_Stiglitz> ....?
[19:39] <%NOTHALCYON> Yes
[19:39] <%NOTHALCYON> But this is ED
[19:39] <MrSix> But I just need those parts taken out. I'll even let you all leave the dick pics in.
[19:39] <%NOTHALCYON> Train....
�01[19:39] <TrainOfThought> Why exactly do you need the parts taken out?
[19:39] <MrSix> The lulz is what fuels the entire Internets, and all of the e-tribes.
[19:39] <MrSix> Like I said, it's a freakin' matter of my job
[19:39] <%NOTHALCYON> What job?
[19:39] <%NOTHALCYON> I'm curious.
[19:39] <MrSix> Someone mentioned in there just happens to be related to my boss' boss' boss. I could be fired.
�01[19:40] <TrainOfThought> Yes, elaborate
[19:40] <MrSix> Dude, read the article. There's basically my whole life story in there.
[19:40] <Mudz> Mr. Six: Explain
[19:40] <MrSix> I work at a library now.
[19:40] <%NOTHALCYON> I see
�01[19:40] <TrainOfThought> Well
[19:40] <MrSix> Look man, read the article
�01[19:40] <TrainOfThought> it's not like you wrote the article
�01[19:40] <TrainOfThought> It's not like YOU said all those things
[19:40] <MrSix> I'd appreciate it if you gave me a free pass on this
[19:40] <MrSix> No
�01[19:40] <TrainOfThought> So what is there to be concerned about?
[19:40] <%NOTHALCYON> Someone just wrote it
[19:40] <Mudz> Mr 6: What's the content of the article?
[19:40] <MrSix> Yeah, she was pissed anyway
[19:41] <MrSix> Those are her pics and all that
�01[19:41] <TrainOfThought> Well
[19:41] <MrSix> it's my freakin' ex-gf
[19:41] <%NOTHALCYON> Mudz: The Two Worlds article
�01[19:41] <TrainOfThought> If they're posted on the internet
�01[19:41] <TrainOfThought> they're fair game
[19:41] <MrSix> And she is not of the Internets, which means she doesn't understand stuff like that
�01[19:41] <TrainOfThought> for posting anywhere on the net
�01[19:41] <TrainOfThought> and I mean ANYWHERE
[19:41] <MrSix> No doubt.
[19:41] <MrSix> But I mean just here
[19:41] <%NOTHALCYON> Nothing can get taken down from the internet
[19:41] <MrSix> And I'm not talking about pics, I'm talking mostly about the stuff about her, so it's like...information.
[19:41] <%NOTHALCYON> Yes
�01[19:41] <TrainOfThought> So
[19:41] <MrSix> I know that, dude. I'm of the Internets, just like you.
�01[19:42] <TrainOfThought> Who is this person you are concerned about?

[20:07] <+MrSix> Oh...no, I think that's either her or a friend of hers
[20:07] <+MrSix> (my ex-gf, I mean)
[20:08] <+MrSix> I got this e-mail saying that she had discovered pics and text about her and all that, and since I knew about this article already that's the first thing that came to mind
[20:08] <%NOTHALCYON> Oh...
[20:08] <%xlene> lol Penis.
[20:08] <@vonranke> its a pretty cool story
[20:08] <+MrSix> yeah, it is
[20:08] <%NOTHALCYON> lol BIGOTZZZZ
[20:08] <+MrSix> I just need the ex-gf stuff taken down
[20:08] <+MrSix> I think she'd be okay after that
[20:09] <%NOTHALCYON> Would you really get in trouble for that pic?
[20:09] <%NOTHALCYON> *those pics
�01[20:09] <+TrainOfThought> MrSix: Have you tried explaining to her that you didn't post those pics?
[20:09] <%NOTHALCYON> Or that you never created that article
[20:09] <+MrSix> no, we...uh...don't really talk anymore
[20:09] <%NOTHALCYON> let alone had any affiliations with the editor
[20:09] <+MrSix> besides, like I said, she doesn't understand stuff like that
[20:10] <+MrSix> and anyway it's my own fault that I spread drama like that around about her
[20:10] <&Sheneequa> MrSix: this decision would be easier if the virginity story wasn't so fucking funny
[20:10] <+MrSix> all the sex-type stuff
[20:10] <%NOTHALCYON> You can explain it to her.
[20:10] <+MrSix> being that I lost my virginity to her and all
[20:10] <+MrSix> look, what if you kept the virginity story but deleted all references to her?
�01[20:10] <+TrainOfThought> MrSix: My condolences.
[20:10] <+MrSix> Like...substitute "Jean Grey" for all mentions of her
�01[20:10] <+TrainOfThought> Well
[20:10] <+MrSix> I'd be cool with that
[20:10] <@wit> MrSix its only fun because of your mentions of her
�01[20:10] <+TrainOfThought> that would be false information
[20:10] <+MrSix> :rolleyes:
[20:11] <@wit> ok
[20:11] <@wit> can you give us anything funnier as a substitute?
[20:11] <+MrSix> Like what?
�01[20:11] <+TrainOfThought> The Big Red?
�01[20:11] <+TrainOfThought> Srsly
�01[20:11] <+TrainOfThought> that comment on the pictures
[20:11] <+MrSix> No...she'd know that was her
�01[20:11] <+TrainOfThought> made me lol
[20:11] <+MrSix> The idea is to take out all mentions of her
[20:11] <+MrSix> Um..."Cookie Monster"?
[20:11] <+MrSix> Cookie mOnster is pretty funny
�01[20:11] <+TrainOfThought> And you can't just explain this to her?
[20:11] <+MrSix> he loves eating cookies a lot. Kinda like my ex!
�01[20:11] <+TrainOfThought> I mean
�01[20:12] <+TrainOfThought> she has your email
[20:12] <&Sheneequa> yeah this sounds fair
[20:12] <&Sheneequa> if we get a video
[20:12] <+MrSix> I already sent an e-mail to her
[20:12] <+MrSix> I have yet to hear back
[20:12] <+MrSix> dude, I don't have a laptop now
[20:12] <@Poly> if someone here has an SA archives account please PM me
[20:12] <+MrSix> it's in the shop
�15[20:13] * NOTHALCYON sets mode: +v u-max
[20:13] <%NOTHALCYON> THERE

[20:13] <@wit> MrSix we need something to replace the lady with
[20:14] <@wit> would you be willing to provide some kind of reenactment?
[20:14] <+MrSix> I dunno...get fuckin' tubgirl for all I care
[20:14] <+MrSix> I don't really give a shit
[20:14] <+MrSix> and like I said, I can't do any shit now, I don't have my laptop with me
[20:14] <+MrSix> I'm using my apartment's business office computer
[20:14] <+MrSix> and they close in 45 mins
[20:14] <@wit> well we do care
[20:15] <+MrSix> Look...you just gotta remember, she's gonna be monitoring this shit, and she's kinda...simple about the ways of the Internets. She's not gonna understand lulz like you or I do.
[20:15] <+MrSix> So as funny as whatever you're suggesting would be, she's not gonna think so, and it's her being okay with it that my job relies on.
�01[20:16] <+TrainOfThought> Well
[20:16] <@wit> well could you reenact the photos yourself in a wig for example?
�01[20:16] <+TrainOfThought> if she's the main person concerned
�01[20:16] <+TrainOfThought> you could recommend her to visit our IRC
[20:16] <+MrSix> Dude, she doesn't even know what IRC is
[20:16] <+MrSix> She's a girl
[20:16] <+MrSix> Remember?
[20:16] <@vonranke> edf is like, 50% womens

[20:17] <%NOTHALCYON> NOTHALCYON = girl
[20:17] <&Sheneequa> MrSix: imma go eat food
[20:17] <+MrSix> Like...rural areas. So she's not really that skilled in the Ways of the Internets
[20:17] <&Sheneequa> MrSix: wit can help y ou

�02[20:17] * &Sheneequa (jwales@wikia.com) Quit (Quit: lol�)
[20:18] <@vonranke> ok, so MrSix, i can understand your frustration, and know its necessary to protect your interests. but we have a website to run, and as a wiki, we cant just oversite things people dont like
�01[20:18] <+TrainOfThought> MrSix: You could help her join #wiki through Mibbit
�01[20:18] <+TrainOfThought> it's fairly simple
[20:18] <+MrSix> Dude, honestly, I'd rather talk to her as little as possible
[20:18] <+MrSix> Look, I can see I'm not getting anywhere here
[20:18] <+MrSix> I mean, I know all about giving someone the runaround. I used to be part of goon raiding/trolling groups who did the same
[20:18] <&sherrod> MrSix: do you know wordpress?
[20:18] <+MrSix> No
[20:18] <+MrSix> I don't have a blog
[20:19] <&sherrod> MrSix: no one is giving you the run around, from what i can tell
[20:19] <&sherrod> we just are having a hard time caring
[20:19] <+MrSix> Yeah, I know
[20:19] <+MrSix> that's why I'm a carefag
[20:19] <&sherrod> ED is defined more by apathy than malice
[20:19] <+MrSix> And you're...uh...not

[20:19] <+MrSix> Fair enough
[20:20] <+MrSix> Look, I just need you all to work with me on this
[20:20] <+MrSix> I'm trying not to be TOO butthurt, 'cause I know all about your resistance only makes my penis harder and all that
[20:20] <@wit> no
[20:20] <@wit> hold on here
[20:20] <@wit> youre asking us to be reasonable
[20:20] <@wit> that doesnt work
[20:20] <+MrSix> wait...is that a good thing?
[20:20] <+MrSix> oh
[20:20] <+MrSix> well...no I'm not
[20:20] <+MrSix> I'm asking you to be not-as-shitty about things
[20:20] <@wit> youre asking for lulz to be removed from an article
[20:21] <+MrSix> no
[20:21] <@wit> what are you putting back into it?
[20:21] <@wit> yes
[20:21] <+Cunt_Destroyer> Im taking off my pants
�15[20:21] * NOTHALCYON sets mode: -v Lusit
[20:21] <+MrSix> I'm still okay with leaving some lulz in thiere
[20:21] <@wit> yes you are
[20:21] <%NOTHALCYON> Lusit: Blame Kale
[20:21] <@vonranke> MrSix: basically, it's good you're not going on deletion sprees and sock vandalism. that counts towards something
[20:21] <+MrSix> I mean shit, I said I'm okay with keeping the dick pics in there
[20:21] <+MrSix> THAT'S lulz, right?
[20:21] <@wit> no
[20:21] <@wit> frankly thats repulsive
[20:21] <@wit> i cant stand extroverted people like that
[20:21] <+MrSix> Dude, I'm from the Internet just as you. I feed off lulz just as you all do. I'd never deny an Internet person his lulz.
[20:21] <@wit> exposing themselves online
[20:22] <+MrSix> nah, dude. I'm...I'm not like that, man. I'm not an "extrovert". I'm from the Internet, just like you
[20:22] <+MrSix> I mean shit, I know all about the memes, Pedobear, efg, all the raiding events, all that stuff
�01[20:22] <+TrainOfThought> You exposed yourself online
[20:22] <+MrSix> I'm one of you all, man
�01[20:22] <+TrainOfThought> we've had a member of our forums do that
[20:22] <+Cunt_Destroyer> haha
�01[20:22] <+TrainOfThought> she was never seen from again
[20:22] <@wit> no, no you are not.
[20:22] <+MrSix> Eh...techicailly I sent pics to a friend about some medical advice
[20:23] <+MrSix> I thought I could trust him about that...but I was wrong
[20:23] <+MrSix> (the medical problem being that I had a tiny penis :-/ )
[20:23] <@wit> look, i dont give a flying fuck if you sent them to NASA
[20:23] <@wit> youre wanting something removed from ED
[20:23] <@wit> to do that you have to contribute something of equal value
[20:23] <@wit> what is the value of this
[20:23] <+MrSix> Alright
[20:23] <+MrSix> That I can understand.
[20:24] <+MrSix> What about some more of my Livejornal? I can send you all some of the Arielverse stories.
[20:24] <+MrSix> Dude, I'm a goddamn lolcow. You should ask some of the Skype goon crew about me, they'd tell you
[20:24] <+MrSix> If you want something of equal value I can give you that shit in spades. Quid pro quo.
[20:25] <@wit> hold please
[20:26] <@wit> MrSix have you an email address we can contact you on?
[20:26] <+MrSix> As long as you don't trade it around or leak it, sure
[20:26] <@wit> pm please.
[20:26] <@wit> of course not
[20:26] <+MrSix> Fuck it, just catch me on Facebook. it's just facebook.com/twoworlds
[20:26] <+MrSix> That's the easiest
[20:26] <@wit> no
[20:27] <@vonranke> we cant do that
[20:27] <+MrSix> And you all probably have alt Facebooks anyway
[20:27] <@wit> listen
[20:27] <+MrSix> why not?
[20:27] <@wit> ok
[20:27] <@wit> theres no why not
[20:27] <@vonranke> because my facebook contains irl name, photo and other details
[20:27] <@wit> theres no fucking questions
