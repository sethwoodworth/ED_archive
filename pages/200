'''Absinthe''' is what [[Borat|Czech]] people and supposedly "[[art]]" [[fags]] drink 24/7 to become really really fucked-up. [[bullshit| If you drink 4 shots of Absinthe you get really high and start to see shit that's not real]], which is why was outlawed in many countries for a time. It is actually not illegal currently in most countries, although sometimes hard to find in some places due to low demand. If you drink this shit you'll end up looking like Marilyn Manson who drinks the stuff.

Going to the [[Poland|Czech]] [[fail|Republic]] (absinthe has nothing to do with Czech Republic, you stupid fuck) without trying Absinthe would be like going to Las Vegas without gambling or to the Internet without downloading [[porn]]z.  It has recently been re-legalized in the [[United States|U.S. and A]], where at least six brands are now available - the French "Lucid", the Swiss "Kubler", and the Chicagoan "Sir√®ne", which is actually quite good, despite what you may have heard about [[American]] skill at making booze.

The other brands can be found [http://www.bevlaw.com/absinthe.htm here].  The [[Borat|Czech]] style of Absinthe is basically the [[crap|Budweiser]] of the Absinthe world, and lighting the sugar cube on fire is [[awesome|bullshit]] [[lie|that was invented for tourists]]; if [[you]] [[fail|try to do it at home]], you're just going to [[divide by zero|fuck everything up and die]].
