[[Image:Bat origami.gif|thumb|An illustrated how-to.]]
'''Folding@Home''' ([[typical]]ly written ''F@H'') is an [[Internets]] [[acronym]] used by bored housewives when they are chatting with their peers. It is also the biggest waste of energy ever, operated by Stanford University which nobody (except nerds and [[PS3]] owners) has ever fucking heard of.

==Usage==
:'''Mom 1:''' Hey my washing machine is broken, can I use yours before Husband gets home?
:'''Mom 2:''' yes but you have to F@H because I have to pick up the kid from lacrosse practice.
