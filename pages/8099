Testing your Wiki skillz
So you are new to MediaWiki and don't know how it works? You aren't alone. Even [[Jewbo Wales|Old Jewbo]] has a bit of trouble here and there. Well... he has more trouble than the average [[Wikipedophile]], even though he runs the joint and is a closet [[furry]]. But I digress.

MediaWiki isn't an easy piece of shit to use, as there is no user who cares enough about [[noob|you]] to help, and the manual on TOW is complete and utter shit, undeserving of even the <nowiki>{{crap}}</nowiki> template. So here are a few A+ pointers to developing your mad wikisk1llz, d00d.

==Learning MediaWiki - Basics==
Follow this quick tutorial to learn how to blank a page on WikiPedia, and then use a different IP to continue your learning:

===Steps===
#Firstly, you need to create an account on [[TOW]], and click on the thing in the top corner that says '''Sign in/Create account'''. Following on, click on the Create new account link, and sign up as "FuckYouWikipedia", with the password as "LOL JEWS".
#Find the Featured Article, and click on the '''Edit''' tab. Select ALL the text, and press the delete key on your keyboard.
#Go down to the edit summary, and enter "Fucking Wikipedo kikes, lol".
#Click the '''Save''' button.
#Repeat until banned.
#Once banned, either release/renew your IP, or turn off your modem for a minute, and turn it back on. Continue these steps until you are confident with this procedure.


These are the most important functions that MediaWiki has to offer. Once you have mastered them, you are a certified Wiki-master. [[Uber]] kEwL d00d. Next, we will learn how to move pages.

==Moving pages==
Having completed the previous tutorial, you are now ready to learn how to move pages. This can be a bit tricky, so bear with me:

===Steps===
#Firstly, register a new account on Wikipedia. Go get a drink, and come back three or four days later, so you can start moving whatever you wish.
#Now, target an article. Try one that won't be discovered quickly, like [[Nazi|Fascism]] or [[Furry]]. Find it, and then click on the tab that says '''Move'''. You should reach a screen that has 3 edit boxes.
#The top box contains the current article name. Leave that. The second one is the most important one. Now, carefully input an offensive word or phrase, and then click the '''Move''' button below.
#Repeat until banned.

And there you have it. You are now able to move pages like a [[Willy on Wheels|pro]]!

==Redirects==
Redirects are an integral part of any wiki, and you simply '''must''' learn how they work if you are to be of any use, unlike certain [[User:Miltopia|people]]. Here you will learn the basics of redirection.

===Steps===
#Register a Wikipedia account, and find an article that is rather inconspicuous, like [[Jews]].
#Erase everything, like in the [[Testing your Wiki skillz#Learning MediaWiki - Basics|basics]] tutorial, but don't save it just yet.
#Type in "<nowiki>#redirect [[Bullshit]]</nowiki>", and save. You now have a redirect.
#Continue until you are banned, or confident that you can reproduce the redirect without any difficulty whatsoever.

Congratulations, you now can create [[A plus|A+++++]] redirects!

==Sockpuppet farming==
This is an essential element of becoming a successful wiki user. To get further, you need friends. And you don't have any. So why not be your own buddy?

===Steps===
#Register an account on Wikipedia. Then register another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another.
#Keep them separate. You don't want to give them away! If one lands into trouble, though, you'll need to change your IP and get your friend outta that shit!
#If one gets nominated for adminship, you ALL vote.

This is an essential weapon for your wikiarsenal. Use it.

==Fucking over users ''en masse'' (for AOL users)==
This one is easy. The aim is to get your IP banned, which totally fucks over many other AOL users due to their shitty setup.

===Steps===
#Use an anonymous IP on [[TOW]], and vandalize the fuck out of some pages.
#Do so until banned.
#Change your IP, and continue doing steps 1 and 2.

This is very, very simple, but is very effective. Have fun!
