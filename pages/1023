Somewhere along the line of [[furry|furfaggotry]] came along Blaze, a black wolf ([[wolfaboo|so original]]) who is the biggest typical furfag yet. What Blaze does in his spare time, when he isn't crying for help in his journals for money, he is ripping off commissioners on [[Furaffinity]] and bragging about how the condom slipped off when he was fucking his [[16 year old girls|17 year old girlfriend]], who constantly white knight's for him.

He also likes to pretend that he's "popufur" by listing actual popufurs like Serpy in his FA friends list, when really most of the people in said list can't stand him. Besides, we all know [[noone]] in the fandom cares about him, because he does not even have a Wikifur page. 

His other hobbies include pretending he's on staff at fur cons, [[plushophilia]], pretending he knows shit about computers, and claiming he can fix them, when in reality no sane being would let his stubby paws touch their machine, [[Fucktard|marching in fursuit parades with no fursuit]], [[Windows Movie Maker|professional video editing]], and fursuit repair. And by repair we mean "Putting the suit on and destroying it moar by rolling around on the filthy ground with it".

In addition, he likes to b'aww to his "lawyer" and "private investigators" over matters such as, this very article. Even though he clearly has no money to live, let alone hire such a person over internet drama. He was last seen [[butthurt|contacting private investigators]] over this article, forgetting the [[Serious business|First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution]].



==History==
Blaze first became popular whoring himself out on [[SecondLife]] to other furries, or even humans, for lindens (currency in Secondlife). After having his ass [[Goatse|split apart by a werewolf]], he would be given the lindens, convert it into real [[money]] (Though, it couldn't have been much, since one thousand lindens is only seven bucks) to keep whatever shack of a home he stayed in, and move off to another host to latch himself onto like a parasite, all for the same redundant sexual acts again. Oh, he likes to think he's Mario too.

Blaze also likes to blame most of the problems he has, or causes, on the [[child abuse|abuse]] he apparently sustained from past foster families, and the fact that he has to [[lie|deal with a lot of stress]] while begging for rides to fur cons and choosing whether he feels like fapping to [[Krystal]] or [[pokemon|Ash Ketchum]] today. Most of his issues would be solved if he'd grow the fuck up, stop being so obsessed with furry, and get a real job or [[an hero]]. Either would work.
[[Image:Marioblaze.jpg|thumb|left|The short stature, the dark hair, the unruly, unkempt mustache, the lack of proper English, stubby legs, hmmm...]]

Blaze's squeaky voice and [[fugly|handsome]] features as well as his [[asshole|witty charm]] could win over any [[wimmins|woman]], or [[faggot|man]]...

Blaze has [[lie|quite a way with the ladies]]. He was lucky enough to have a relationship with Dark-Goddess, a FurAffinity porn artist, but blew it with her.
First, he wanted to make a deal with the infamous furry, [[pedophile]] Tora (or "Growley") for a room for the current year's Califur. Either Growley would [[rape|sleep]] with Blaze, or he could have sex with her, but Growley wanted to [[sick fuck|watch]]. Of course, his girlfriend, who had a brain in her head, told him no. Needless to say, neither attended Califur that year...

Second, he was unable to [[dumbass|comprehend]] basic High School math, therefore he would whine to his girlfriend to sit with him night after night trying to tutor him, when really all he wanted was the answers without learning anything at all. Despite that, he still failed and after getting on his [[blowjob|hands and knees]] and begging to be passed. He was given a deal by the staff to clean the school after classes, and he could get his diploma. Is this [[No|legit]]?

Finally his mate wised up and dumped his ass (Not before finding better dick) which was the epiphany to Blaze that he is indeed, nothing but a furry loser.

Shortly after, [[shit nobody cares about|his father died]], and now uses the death of a man who wasn't even biologically his father as an excuse for everything. Despite the fact that when the man was alive, he would slander his name enough to make Satan cry.

===Someone Call Whine-one-one!!!===
Blaze is also infamous for constant whining on his FA journal. Leeching money off of other furs, taking overly-priced commissions for his [[shit|art]] and begging for rides to every furry convention in the country.
It wouldn't be so bad if he were actually using the money he leeched for his house or car, but every time he get's a decent amount of cash in his pocket, it goes straight to furry conventions, another [[retarded]] [[zetatoys|toy]], or [[pokemon]] cards.

How to recognize Blaze's journals of butthurt on FA:
*If the title states anything to do with [[No|"OMG HELP ME D'X"]] or "I'm in deep shit!!!", you know most definitely it's a journal of him begging for more money.
*If he claims he is open for commissions, when really he means "Give me $8 for me to copypaste a bunch of images together for you"
*If he cries about how he cannot obtain new objects for his car, gas money or college, he's really just looking for a couple $$$ thrown his way to go to the PS or another furry convention.

Besides that, he whines about his [[lol|heart condition]]. When really, he would be improving on it if he'd STOP RUNNING AROUND THE FUCKING FUR CONS WITH A DOG SQUEAKER UNTIL HE PASSES OUT FROM HEART FAILURE. He's had to be rushed to the ER for his heart, after running amok around the con, and returned home with a heart monitor.

===OrionWolf Medias===

As Blaze claims, it is a small company that accepts art commissions from furries. When really it's an imaginary business, where the only "we" involved is himself pretending he is a manager of a corporation.

It's even funnier when he answers his cell phone as the OrionWolf Medias Manager, pretending to be an important corporate individual, when really he's just a hairy spic sitting in his room, fapping to [[Lucario]]


[[Image:IPawd.jpg|thumb|Eight dollars for this delicious copypasta!]]
===Ripping off Commissioners===

Blaze takes commissions for badges known as "iPawed" badges. Basically you pay him $8 to copy and paste art he did not make onto an iPod touch template and type your name onto it. [[DO NOT WANT|Sounds tempting...]]
[[Image:Commish2.jpg|thumb|left|A list of his commission prices. Note that nothing in there is drawn by him at all]]

Other then that, he takes commissions for reference sheets and other general shit furries throw their money away for. Currently he has three people in his slots who have been waiting almost, or in one person's case over, a year for their commissions.

When confronted about his blatant exploitation of Furaffinity, he simply BLOCKED, E-VICTORY!








===Teddy Fucker===

There's a rule in the relationship world; never give your significant other something that could be used as blackmail later. Blaze made a video of himself literally raping a pink stuffed teddy bear ruthlessly. Then took it upon himself to send it to his current girlfriend via the internet. She was under-age at the time. It later was posted to Xtube


[[Image:Lolcum.jpg|thumb|left|He came teaspoons]]

{{quote|So, I found this little private video of me what I sent to my ex, while we were together, as a little thing for her to have fun with, that SOMEHOW leaked out of her computer and was edited to show a really good part that was taken out at the end... Its me, giving my little pink bear --that I ORIGINALLY got for her-- a little raeping with my nice 6 3/4inch wolfie cock.. with a little view of me shooting my load out for all to see.|Blaze bragging about his [[lie|huge cock]]}}

==What Blaze does In His Spare Time==

When he isn't typing up [[moar]] journals begging for money, he's spending his remaining free time that he COULD be using on his owed commissions, on making retarded videos with his sperm-crusted wolf puppet. Note the fake gangster accent, and his undeserved sense of self pride as he pretends he's somebody in the furry fandom and part of staff at every fur con.
