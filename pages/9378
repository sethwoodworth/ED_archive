{{squote|We strongly discourage any kind of animal abuse. The purpose of this website is to give a complete picture of the animalsex / beastiality topic. So please see the entire website before you make up your mind :-)|See [[Dubious Disclaimer]].}}


'''Zoophilia.net''' is a site which documents [[bestiality]] in a professional and open-minded manner, yet strangely enough has nothing bad to say about [[furries|people who fuck their dogs]]. What seperates it from [http://wiki.patrioticnigras.org/wiki/Ebon_Lupus deluded otherkin who preach their bullshit philosophy about sex with animals] and [[DracoGuard|those stupid enough to take photos of themselves giving Fido a handjob]] is that Zoophilia.net provides [[retarded|interesting]] statistics and data about the lives of animal-lovers. [[No|Presuming of course anything you read on the internet is true]].

==The Glaringly Obvious==
{{squote|What's it like to be a 'Zoo'? I suspect it's an awful lot like being 'straight'.|[http://www.zoophilia.net/whatislike.php A worrying amount of these people are either gay or bisexual.]}}


*The majority of zoophiles are male (85% versus 15%)
*The majority of zoophiles started buggering animals in their 20s - presumably after realising no human will want them.
*The zoophiles favorite animals are [[PoeticIrony|dogs]] and [[Mr Hands|horses]]. (Evidently,it's due to the animals' large [[dick|dicks]].)

|Zoosexuality is not a fetish, it is the life-style of one who has a loving, most likely sexual fondness for non-human animals.|It's not rape if you love them. Really.

|First and foremost, non-human animals are able to consent to sex with humanimals. I say this regardless of the propaganda spread by anti-zoos because I've experienced both willing and unwilling partners.|Non-willing partners?

|I have, myself, found these things worth the risk to live as I do, but these things as well as others are thoughts you should seriously consider before jumping into this way of life.|Like social rejection, a long prison sentence and burning in hell for all eternity.

|I would like you to know that it is my personal belief that it's better to love your partner(s) rather than merely using them for self gratification. Not only does love render sex more enjoyable but also makes abuse less likely. I realize that it is possible to have loveless sex without causing harm to your partner, but to be honest, [[hypocrite|I have a personal bias against those who would use another merely to gratify themselves]].|[[lol wut]]?

|I'd say it's the difference between having a caring relationship and just using the animal for gratification. The bestialists, from my point of view, just basically use the animal for sexual relief . . . they may take care of it and that . . . but he's treating it as . . . a sex toy. You get just as much out of it as out of what you would, as using a doll or going and seeing a prostitute. Whereas a zoophile relationship is more. It's a marriage, in every sense of the term.|Again under the strange impression that it's not rape if you love them.

|Luckily, because of the Internet . . . you meet people and realize that it's really not a disorder. It's just a way of life. It's good to know that|Oh fuck you internet, fuck you.

|Exactly. Finding out that there were other zoos and speaking with others randomly, some of the most unscrewed up people I've met in my life . . .|Unlike those evil hyoomans.

|Drawing parallels with the gay community . . . the very first time on there I met a black bear person and I asked, 'well, how come there's so few black bears?' and they said, 'Oh, there's plenty of black bears, they just don't talk to you.' 'And why not?' 'Well, because you're white.' And so there's an overlying tendency among ethnic groups to not mix . . . so, it's possible that there are blacks out there, but . . . they may feel so alienated that . . . they're a zoo and we're zoos, but they still can't relate to us.|Sex with animals is OK - but what [[sick fuck]] would have sex with a [[White people|honky-tonk]]?

|It is certainly worth mentioning that there are just endless numbers of parallels between zoophilia in American society and homosexuals in American society . . . we are following exactly the same path, footstep for footstep, of gays, except that we're farther behind . . . well, there are stereotypes . . . you go back a few decades, all gays were drag queens . . . child molesters.|Everybody assumes zoos are are gay men who fuck dogs ... wait ...

|Without exception . . . the media will always use the words . . . 'sexually assaulted the animal.' Always, every single time . . . A zoophile is painted as a bestialist who will eventually become something like a rapist. Will go out and shoot people at McDonald's, a pedophile. Because they're always coming up with studies that say this person just shot 20 people at the local McDonald's used to be a bestialist. Or you know, he's a pedophile, he started out with animals for sexual gratification . . .|He waited for the dog to make the first move.

==Relationships (With Humans)==
[[File:Zoophile.net parents.PNG|thumb|270px|Note the underlined sections.]]

<big><u>Upbringing</u></big>

*Surprisingly the majory of zoophiles describe their childhoods as either ''[[Mundane|Average]]'', ''Close'' or ''[[Hypocrite|Religious]]'' ([[lol]]).
*More than 50% recribed the relationships with their parents as [[Incest|"Good" or "Very Good"]].
*Only the minority (6% or less) described their childhoods as ''Abusive'', ''Unloving'' or being stricken with ''Poverty''.


Interesting side note - if [[you]] are stupid enough to tell your parents you've been sucking Rover's cock, you are more likely to be accepted if:

a) You are a [[whore|girl]]<br>
b) You tell [[your mother]] rather than your [[daddy|father]].

This is because seeing a blonde bimbo having her pussy fucked raw by a dog is [[truth|hot]] but seeing [[Mr. Hands|a man with a horse cock stuck up his ass isn't]].


<big><u>Interaction with Other Humans</u></big>

*By far the majority of zoophiles who have relationships with humans are female, despite the fact [[women]] only make up 15% of all zoophiles.

*The majority of zoophiles (57% of males and 52% of females) have no social relationships whatsoever (no, [[FurAffinity]] doesn't count).


<big><u>Self-Perception</u></big>

*55% of male zoophiles and 57% of female zoophiles describe themselves as ''Fairly Popular'' despite having no social relationships with humans.


<big>'''Conclusion:'''</big>
<br>
[[You must have been abused as a child|"Zoos" cannot blame their sick fetishes on the abuse they suffered as children]]. Similarly they manage to retain a [[USI|high-level of self-esteem]] despite the fact nobody loves them. We can conclude therefore that their desires are not the result of [[depression]] or repressed sexuality, but stem from the fact no human wants to have sex with these egotistical cunt-rags due to their self-righteousness and the belief [[victim complex|they should be able to do whatever the hell they want without fear of reprisals]].

<big>[[TL;DR]]</big> - there is nothing wrong with them. They simply [[fail]] at life.


But of course [[common knowledge|you didn't need a website to tell you that]].

==Other [[Statistics]] (Collected outside Zoophilia.net)==

# 95,638,231 women have intentionally engaged in bestiality.
# 255,035,283 men have intentionally engaged in bestiality.
# For the rest of you, we'll accept your plea that it was unintentional, but we have our suspicions.


These figures suggest the following:

# In a train carrying 300 people - 5 women and 12 men are experienced.
# If your company has 100 people - 3 women and 8 men have had experience.
# At the Hollywood bowl, you will find 261 experienced women, and 695 men. Actually as it's Hollywood those figures are misleading, as they fail to apply the [[Richard Gere]] multiplier. The real figures are 3,201 experienced women and all but one of the men. And you can bet the one isn't Richard.
#[http://www.snopes.com/risque/juvenile/lobster.asp You'll find that women should be careful to give their lobsters an enema before engaging them in BDSM sex]


Some popular animals that zoophiles enjoy having sex with include equines, gerbils, canines, poultry, squirrels, domesticated cattle, roadkill, cats, dolphins, handfuls of mealworms, kangaroos, large snakes, primates, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, bacteria and fungi.

==You Can't Judge Love!!1!!one==
Undoubtedly the most depressing section of this website is entitled '''[http://www.zoophilia.net/downside.php The potential down side of acceptance]''' - which raises concerns about what should happen if being a animal rapist becomes normal. Words cannot describe the sheer brain-killing shit that has spewed from the [[sick fuck|sick]] minds of these pseudo-scientific fuckwits, so we shall let them do the talking:
