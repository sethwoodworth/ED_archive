[04:52] <Hoveround> davidtmanforever . if you dont state your case soon we will have to vote 
based on the evidence at hand
[04:52] <davidtmanforever> OK
[04:53] <davidtmanforever> People are sayng nasty things about me and don't even know who I am
[04:53] <davidtmanforever> and they called my friend Austan, a baby molester
[04:53] <davidtmanforever> and that he eats babies
[04:53] <davidtmanforever> I want them to stop it
[04:53] <Hoveround> Do you feel that there is legal or criminal basis behind their actions?
[04:54] <Hoveround> davidtmanforever?
[04:54] <davidtmanforever> What about defamation of character? 
[04:55] <Hoveround> submitted for the panel: defamation of character is actionable where the 
article has had a significant impact on the plaintiffs life
[04:55] <Hoveround> such as their public reputation, loss of gainful employment
[04:55] <Hoveround> or loss of social stature
[04:55] <Hoveround> do you feel this article has caused you to be denied employment
[04:55] <Hoveround> or affected your reputation in real life?
[04:56] <Hoveround> davidtmanforever?
[04:57] <davidtmanforever> Yes, there are people who enjoy my reviews on YouTube and these people 
are amking me look like some type of idiot who enjoys being harrassed.
[04:57] * malber has joined #arbchat
[04:57] <davidtmanforever> I have a question
[04:58] <Hoveround> go ahead
[04:58] <oclet> have you ever touched a child in a less than appropriate way
[04:58] <davidtmanforever> Do you think it's appropriate for people to set up webpage accounts dedicated to harrassing people on YouTube?
[04:58] * Hoveround sets mode: +v dr_g0sp
[04:58] <oclet> the internet has a certain right to deem what is appropriate and what is not
[04:58] <Hoveround> it is protected by free speech rights
[04:58] <Hoveround> and is lawful
[04:59] <oclet> and since you are a baby molester its 100% covered by law
[04:59] <davidtmanforever> Is the intention of your website to be a platform for people to trash other peoples accounts
[04:59] <Hoveround> no
[04:59] <Hoveround> it is to catalogue and document lols and drama
[04:59] <Hoveround> on the internet
[05:00] * DLB is now known as DLB|work
[05:00] <davidtmanforever> Then this account falls outside your intentions and should be terminated.
[05:00] <Hoveround> do you mean article?
[05:00] <Hoveround> please clarify
[05:00] * Hoveround sets mode: +v PunaKone
[05:00] <oclet> please watch your tone in #arbchat david
[05:00] <davidtmanforever> Yes, I mean article.
[05:00] <Hoveround> i call PunaKone as a witness
[05:00] <Hoveround> PunaKone
[05:00] <Hoveround> is davidtmanforever full of lulz
[05:00] <PunaKone> yes your honor
[05:01] <PunaKone> yes your honor
[05:01] <PunaKone> he is
[05:01] <Hoveround> and is documentation of davidtmanforever's activities within the stated purpose of ED
[05:01] <dr_g0sp> Your Honor, I would like to speak on behalf of the state of Lulz.
[05:01] <Hoveround> dr_g0sp, proceed
[05:01] <davidtmanforever> wat r lulz?
[05:01] <Hoveround> lulz are a corruption of LOL
[05:01] <PunaKone> it is, your honor
[05:01] <Hoveround> which stands for laugh out loud
[05:01] <davidtmanforever> OK
[05:01] * niggeruin has joined #arbchat
[05:02] <dr_g0sp> I would like to submit to the court that Austan is absolutely the most 
homosexual name that this prosecutor has ever experienced.   I can only imagine a flamboyant homosexual hairdresser or boutique-shopping overprotective suburban soccer mom comming up 
with this name.
[05:02] <Hoveround> so noted.
[05:02] <Hoveround> avidtmanforever> wat r lulz?
[05:02] <Hoveround> [05:01] <Hoveround> lulz are a corruption of LOL
[05:02] <Hoveround> [05:01] <PunaKone> it is, your honor
[05:02] <Hoveround> [05:01] <Hoveround> which stands for laugh out loud
[05:02] <Hoveround> [05:01] <davidtmanforever> OK
[05:02] <Hoveround> [05:01] * niggeruin has joined #arbchat
[05:02] <Hoveround> pp[s
[05:02] <Hoveround> davidtmanforever
[05:02] <davidtmanforever> yes?
[05:02] <Hoveround> can you submit any other evidence
[05:02] <Hoveround> or facts
[05:02] <dr_g0sp> In addition, I believe that calling an individual a "baby raper" on the 
internets is absolutely hilarious
[05:02] <Hoveround> which would compel us to redact the article
[05:03] <davidtmanforever> do you consider it entertaining for people to use this webspace to 
insult each other and accuse each other of all kinds of things that are ridiculously untrue?
[05:03] <Hoveround> yes
[05:03] <Hoveround> yes, we do
[05:03] <PunaKone> your honor, i would like to answer also to davidtmanforever question
[05:04] <davidtmanforever> I guess I know what i'm dealing with, then.
[05:04] <Hoveround> i submit to the panel
[05:04] <Hoveround> extract from ED policy document ED:TRU
[05:05] <Hoveround> �As a whole, ED bears no organized animosity toward people because of their 
race, religion, sexual orientation or any other arbitrary distinction. ED users and sysops come 
from a variety of backgrounds, races, religions, and sexual orientations. While individual users 
may on occasion convey their own prejudices, they should not be considered to be the official position of ED. If you are offended by content on ED it most likely means that you don't 
understand satire.
[05:05] <Hoveround> �. Remember, however, that Encyclopedia Dramatica exists for the lulz. 
Sometimes fiction is funnier than truth; sometimes truth is funnier than fiction. Encyclopedia 
Dramatica strives to strike a balance between them to deliver as many lulz as possible.
[05:05] <Hoveround> Should you find an attack entry about you on Encyclopedia Dramatica, try not
 to take it srsly. We don't, and most of our intelligent readers know better than that.
[05:05] <Hoveround> davidtmanforever in light of this policy
[05:05] <oclet> davidtmanforever: i will bodyslam you
[05:06] <Hoveround> do you still feel that your article represents defamation of character
[05:06] <Hoveround> oclet will come to order
[05:06] <PunaKone> also, all things on ed are true
[05:06] <oclet> everything on ed is true
[05:06] <oclet> especially the part about me being a child molester
[05:06] <Hoveround> davidtmanforever in light of this policy
[05:06] <Hoveround> can you submit any other evidence
[05:06] <Hoveround> which would compel us to redact the article
[05:07] <Hoveround> ?
[05:07] <Hoveround> i will open the floor to discussion and debate before we come to a vote
[05:07] * Hoveround sets mode: -m
[05:07] <davidtmanforever> What evidence is nessassary? I'm a 13yearold kid who likes to review 
video games and I have to be insulted by people who don't think I sound manly enough. Give me a break.
[05:08] <PunaKone> davidtmanforever, the internet isnt fair
[05:08] <dr_g0sp> I thought you were here on behalf of your friend
[05:08] <somekindofcunt> i would like to submit to the court that 13 year olds should not be
 allowed on the internet
[05:08] <Hoveround> davidtmanforever is there a close button or back button on your internet 
browser?
[05:08] <PunaKone> i was bullied in school, now im on the internet
[05:08] <davidtmanforever> Yes, DUH!
[05:08] <Hoveround> what prevents you from using that
[05:08] <Hoveround> when you read something hurtful
[05:08] <PunaKone> then use them
[05:09] <davidtmanforever> People who spend most of their time on the internet looking to 
humiliate 13yearolds, obviously have bigger issues than I do.
[05:09] <Hoveround> as a foreigner, clarification please - which state of the USA allows a 
13 year old to file suit?
[05:10] <ninjagumby> i have not seen any evidence presented by davidtmanforever other than 
he is taking things way too personally
[05:10] <blenderface> I don't think any state allows 13 year olds to file law suits
[05:10] <PunaKone> under 15yearolds in finland arent responsible in court
[05:10] <ninjagumby> age of majority is 18
[05:10] <davidtmanforever> There is no limitation to age when people make false statements 
about you that indicate your responsible for criminal activity.
[05:10] <ninjagumby> in all states
[05:11] <Hoveround> �VOTE 1: IN THE MATTER OF [[GREATEXPECTATIONS320]] MOVE TO DISMISS ON THE 
BASIS OF: No evidence of legal or criminal wrongdoing, Excessive and vexatious butthurt
