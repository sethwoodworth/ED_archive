''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe'' is the first and most famous novel in a series of seven [[fantasy]] books for children written by renowned English [[fag]] and owner of [[Microsoft]] C. S. Lewis.

It has been [[TL;DR|well-documented]] as being the first case of written literature to influence children into becoming [[furfags]] and future [[pedophiles]], as one of its characters appears to be a scarf-wearing fawn with a penchant for [[BSDM]] and [[rape]], Susan developed quickly into [[jailbait]], and Lucy is a wet dream for [[Dungeons & Dragons|D&D]]-playing [[pedophiles]] everywhere.  For some reason, some [[you|dickshit]] decided to make the first book into an [[Fail|epic]] film, which although littered with [[Shit|special effects]] has been heavily criticised as being [[TL;DR]].  It is not currently known if the rest are to be made into movies as well, but several [[Lulz|spin-offs]] have been made such as [[Harry Potter]] and [[LOTR]], and Lewis has been paid for lending his name to several types of [[Dildo]], Playstation games, a TV series, and every single bug that occurs in a [[Word]] document.



== The General Plot of the Novel ==

During a game of [[rape]] in which four evacuees escape the wrath of a perverted old man who turns out to be [[Hitler]], the youngest of four children decides to hide in a [[hugbox|big wooden box]].  This turns out to be the Tardis and transports him/her/it/them to a magical land full of [http://www.deviantart.com furfags] and a [[BSDM|White Witch]] ruling the land of Narnia since [[Last Thursday]].  Some [[World War 2|war]] occurs and one of the kids decides to commit [[bestiality]] with [[Lion King|Mufassa]], and then all the children get [[Murder|knighted]] and reign happily ever after. One of the main themes is the [[pedophilia|pedohilic]] relationship between one of the children and a much older [[yiff|half goat thing]].

The second novel, and all the following novels, had basically the same plot outlines, featuring Disney-esque [[Disney|talking animals]], [[Harry Potter|wizzard chess]], [[Pokemon]], and [[CP|Quidditch]], leading many critics to believe that C.S Lewis was actually a thieving scumbag even though he wrote the books before Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.  After seven novels the public was fed up with reading about a bunch of 11 year-olds plotting to over-throw [[Your Mom|Sauron]], escaping getting [[Banhammered|baleeted]] from history, and starting the shooting at [[Vagina|Virginia Tech]].  Instead, they decided to read [[Harry Potter]], which is about [[furries]].

There are no synopses of the third novel or anything after that, because nobody fucking bothered reading after the first two books. Why, you ask? Because anything beyond the second books sucked so much cock that the already high levels of cock suckery in the previous books paled in comparison to these. To preserve your sanity, avoid the last books more than you avoided the first two. 

[[TL;DR]] Narnia is what happens when you do crack inside a wardrobe.
