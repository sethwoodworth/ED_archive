THE NEW HOVEROUND TESTAMENT, BOOK OF CADNOCAT
===THE NEW [[User:Hoveround|HOVEROUND]] TESTAMENT, BOOK OF [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]]===

1:1 In the beginning there was [[Encyclopedia_Dramatica|ED]]. And [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did join this channel and he saw that it was Good. And [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did declare that "this is truly a fine and suitable place for lulz." 

1:2 And lo and behold there were many other lands through the Internets, and [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did trek them for many ages. [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did go on a voyage back to the far off nation of AustNet, where he did troll freely.

1:3 Hark! But did a fellow EDiot respond "Look unto me, and I am also a great provider of trollery; gaze upon the lulz I creatheth in this AustNet land". And [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] saw that it was good.

1:4 And [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did identify this bringer of trollery not as [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]], but as an Angel named [[User:Ronin|Ronin]].

1:5 "Provide for me your MSN address, for I grow weary of this land, and require respite and n00dz far from this wretched Internet Relay Citadel"; said [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]], and [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]] did comply.

1:6 [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]] and [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did have a Holy Dialogue of webcam and fapping; and it was decided that there be a meeting to conjugate the new friendship of these Angel of Lulz.

1:7 The two did meet in IRL, and proceeded to imbibe alcohol, speak of many great ruins and much geekery; and did retire to [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]]'s humble abode as the dawn broke on the Second Day.




2:0 The Second Day dawneth and, well affected by the imbibement of many great and mighty beverages, [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did suggest that the two Angels retire and gain respite within his quarters.

2:1 But a mighty sickness rose within [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]]; and in the very spite of every attempt the Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did make to gain respite, there was a great muttering and joyless exultations from the Angel [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]]. 

2:2 The Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] turned to [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]] and did declare "BEGONE, FOUL EDIOT! I GROW WEARY OF YOUR NONSENSICAL BABBLING. BEGONE SO THAT I MIGHT HAVETH SOME RESPITE!" and summoned the taxi company to his abode.

2:3 [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]] wailed and gnashed and  and seethed with [[butthurt]], and demanded of the Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] "THOU MUST COME OUT OF YOUR DWELLING AND FACE ME, HERE, IN THE OUTSIDE LAND", to which the Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] replied "Fuck off."

2:4 To which there were many great beatings upon the door of the Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]]'s dwelling; and fearing the wrath of an insane [[fgt]]; [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did waver in his faith and called the police.

2:5 Compelled by the beatings upon his door; the Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did allow [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]] entry to his realm a final time, in which he did turneth upside down the quarters (and bedding) in the search for his [[dox|icons of identity]], secured within the fabric pouch of wallet which he did misplace.

2:6 "Begone from here!" exclaimed the Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]]; "and have faith that I may return to you your belongings upon their later discovery."

2:7 And [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]] did vanish.



3:0 And so it came to pass that the [[dox|icons of identity]] were discovered and returned to [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]] by the morrow; but the Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did have a great fear of the chubby Welsh demon, and did charm himself with the writings on the icons; and did save them to "heddwyn dox.txt" on his Incredible Machine.

3:1 A season passed, and [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]] returned to the land of [[ED IRC]], where he cast many jibes and insolent remarks upon the Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]]; who did then present one of the charms from his Incredible Machine, and did cast it across [[ED IRC|#ED]].

3:2 Lo and behold, there was a great outcry of "LOL!"; and this angered the demon [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]].

3:3 "Tread with caution; for you are marked, Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]]", the warning came forth; "I runneth with the Skips gang of Terra Victoria; and death is near."

3:4 And the Angel [[User:Hoveround|Hoveround]] did cower, before consigning [[User:Cadno|CadnoCat]] forever back to his hugbox.

3:5  And that day will two monsters be parted, one monster, a female named Eppigy in order to dwell in the abyss of the jewtube over the fountains of water; and (the other), a male called Djbb, which holds his chest in an invisible desert whose name is Livevideo, east of the garden of Eden. - 1 Enoch 60:7-8
