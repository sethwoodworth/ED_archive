Riboflavin
{{eduser|Seung-Hui Cho}}

[[Image:Supreme_azn.JPG|thumb|Riboflavin is the only [[azn]] on ED. Which also makes him the most [[retard|tarded]] azn on ED.]]

'''Riboflavin''' is the [[EDiot]] who invented [[rainbow blinkies]]. He does not believe in [[Indigo]] and is a faggot [[Vietnam|Charlie]] for doing so. His mother actually does do manicures, because [[stereotype]]s don't lie. He was also once infected with [[Otherkin]] this led him to thoughts of [[an hero]]ism.

Although this [[EDiot]] and possible [[b|b/tard]] (the usual suspects) is [[lonely|so ronery]] and an [[angry Asian man]] [[some argue|it has been disputed]] that the fact that he goes to [[Virginia Tech massacre|Virginia Tech]] is a [[Jews did WTC|total coincidence]]. 

Ribo runs most of ED behind the scenes and is known to manage one of [[Joseph Evers]] many sweatshops where over 10,000 Air Jordan's are produced a day!

Ribo was [[DMCA]]'d in [[2006]] after his Jewmate downloaded a shit off [[Limewire]]. The DMCA claimed he downloaded thehalfbloodprince.'''exe'''. Ribo and his Jewmate both had to take an instructive course as people lulzed at Ribo's expense daily.
