When a [[sex|relationship]] isn't going well, some couples choose to end their relationship. Generally, one person will go to the other and tell them they are unhappy. They will then say that they are "breaking up" with them. It is very painful for both people when this happens, but typically, the one who is dumped is even worse off. But don't worry, [[you]] will never be broken up with, as [[you]] will never have a girlfriend. [[Enjoy your hand]].

==[[IRL]] Break-ups==
Break ups can be a huge source of drama and lulz. [[16 year old girls]] everywhere love writing in their [[LiveJournal]]s about how heart-broken they are over their ordeal, that's, you know, [[fact|never happened to anyone anywhere before]]. In this weakened  state of course, these silly bitches are ideal troll-bait. Also, if you are fortunate enough to be the one initiating the break up, you can do it in a number of interesting ways! If [[you]] are really good, [[virgin|one]] could play the [[sex|rebound]] game. We all know that will not happen.

==LiveJournal And Other Blog Websites BAW==
Woe be unto the heartbroken who have been so wrongfully shamed by someone realizing that their relationship wasn't fulfilling their needs and sought to find solace elsewhere. As was mentioned, everyone is a delicate and unique snowflake that has never had a shitty break up or been dumped much like those burritos you had last night. The LJ community [http://community.livejournal.com/heartbreakrehab/ Heartbreak Rehab] is a fine example of this [[faggot]]ry and stupidity.

Most of the posters are in fact, [[16 year old girls]]. About 10% of the posters appear to be really feminine men or [[faggot]]s that have not come out of the closet yet. [[You]] be the judge. Either way, it's an entertaining way to kill a couple hours if you can stand reading peoples' whining about how no one will ever love them and that one perfect person would be just perfect if they would perfectly love them!

[[Fag]]s.

==[[OL]] Break-ups==
Breaking up online does not always mean leaving a relationship between only two people, it often means [[flounce|leaving the community and / or wiki you have come to know and love]], but have sadly discovered the feeling isn't mutual.

There are many benefits to breaking up. For one thing, you never have to hear the bitch whine and nag you. Not only that, there are many things you can do to her now that you know you can't fuck her. Try jacking it into a mayo jar, [[divide by zero|making her a sammich]] and watching her eat it. Bitch wouldn't swallow before, make her do it now! Also, you know that hot friend of hers? You can feel free to tap that now! Also, if you've got any pictures of your ex (especially nudes), post them all over 4chan, along with her cell number and home address. Sit back and laugh.
