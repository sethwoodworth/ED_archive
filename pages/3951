{{youtube2|Ickeriss69|Ickeriss69}}, AKA Michael Patrick [[Jew|Lotz]] (b. January 21, 1990), is a glorified [[b/tard|/b/tard]], and former [[YouTube]] [[troll]] who enjoys a little [[Anonymous Borg|borgfaggin]]' now and then.  Ironically, he began his "[[SSP|trolling]]" (the term is used loosely) around late '[[2007|07]], not by trolling, but by publicly ''being'' trolled by [[VoicEverything|some other random retards]].  Later, he spent most of his time pursuing [[Gaydiamond]]  (albeit never making it to the level some [[Cyanterrorist|others]] did).  

The real attention whoring started with his subsequent [[facefag|facefagging]] when he jumped on the [[Chris Chan]] bandwagon, gaining what [[namefag|notoriety]] he could by convincing Chris to send him one of his [[SNCA|Sonichu medallions]] at the behest of some faggy clique on YouTube he [[suck cock|wanted to impress]] (tl;dr: had someone else pose as a girl then sat back and received toys in the mail from a retard.).   

Lesser known, however, is that in the past Icky has left an even bigger trail of faggotry for himself, much of it [[Moar|equal]] to the [[butthurt]] whines of any [[aspie]]s he claims to troll so hard.  Basically, if you're a 20 y/o [[goth]] nerd still living with your grandparents in some backwoods suburb in the [[white trash|south]], a lot of trite [[13 year old boy|meme-speak]] and [[USI|self-aggrandization]] can do you [[failure|wonders]].

[[Image:Ickeriss_epic_butthurt.JPG|thumb|"I haven't been happy since the summer of 2004."]]
In 2005 Ickeriss joined the website [http://www.hauntingechoes.com Haunting Echoes], and quickly began "working his way up the internet". With gay post after epic gay post, he not only worked his way up the internet, but up the admin's asses as well. So much so, that in 2007 Michael won the esteemed Haunting Echoes Drama-Llama Award for epic faggotry. What this meant was that on a website populated with angsty [[emo]] [[goth]] [[cutter]]s, Ickeriss made them all feel much better about themselves by just being himself. After all, whenever they were feeling insecure about themselves, they could always fall back on pointing and laughing at him.

If you notice in the "Likes" section of his Haunting Echoes profile, you'll see that Icky says he likes "some guys". A closer inspection of the forum revealed just what kind of guys he likes. Like this post from the thread [http://www.hauntingechoes.com/viewthread.php?tid=9620#pid266019 "Your celeberty Crush"]. Michael reveals that he would very much like to suck the dick of [[lol|Joel McHale, the host of Talk Soup]].

In addition to his posts crying about people picking on him, professing his gay love for the [http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/bio.jsp?franchise=the_soup Talk Soup] guy, and whining about his puppy biting him, Michael has also authored some excellent [[self-insert]] [[werewolf]] [[fanfic]].

{{quote|The half nude man merely smiled slowly at the man. He was perhaps 5"11" or 6 foot the officer noted since the mans long, powerful looking legs, were hanging off the end of the couch. One arm dangled down to the ground while the other was hanging around on the top of the couch down to the other side. His long plack hair wild and hanging down to his shoulders. His face and body was strong if not feral and mangy looking.}}

He's either a [[otherkin|werewolf or a vampire]], depending on what time of day you catch him at.
<br/>
[[Image:Lol_Ickeriss_I_iz_a_vampire.JPG|center]]
<br/><br/>
He also posted on [http://www.vampireforum.net/introductions/1824-unwilling_immortal-intro.html Vampireforum.net] about his superhuman powerz. Now he's not just a vampire, but a '''psychic vampire''', with some other "sanguine habits".
<br/>
[[Image:Lol_ickeriss_i_iz_a_PSYCHIC_vampire.JPG|center]]
<br/><br/>
And why does he think he's a vampire/werewolf/otherworldly creature? Because he [[fail]]ed at [[suicide]]. Makes perfect sense.

==[[how do i shot web|How Do I Summoned Dead?]]==
[[Image:FsjalIckeriss.jpg|thumb]]
In addition to being a "psychic vampire" and a werewolf, Ickeriss is apparently a "[[dildo|necromancer]]" as well. He can be seen on the [http://www.ghostvillage.com/ghostcommunity/index.php?showtopic=23218&start=0&p=456367&#entry456367 ghostvillage.com forums] asking for advice on how to "[[lol|wake up spirits]]". On closer inspection of the thread, you can see that, even on a forum full of [[batshit]] ghostchasers, Michael was still considered to be a bit off. 
<br/><br/>
<center>

</center>

==His Defense==
[[Image:BRILLIANT!.jpg|thumb|[[bullshit|YHBT]]]]
When confronted with having his hand in the [[faggotry]] jar, Michael came up with an epic defense that even rivaled [[OJ]]'s "if the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit". He said, in all seriousness, the following:
{{quote|Have you taken into consideration this is may be a rather large, elaborate, and complex troll.|Ickeriss69}}
That's right. When Michael was 15 years old he knew that 4 years later he would be in this exact place, and in this exact situation. It was a ruse. He set the whole thing up. Using his real pics, birthdate, and locations, the crying about his family and ex's, the werewolf fanfic, wanting to suck Joel McHale's dick, all of it. It was one big [[bullshit|troll]]. It still remains to be seen what he's gained exactly from said ruse, besides looking like he's completely full of shit, but yeah, he totally set this all up. 

==YouTube Shenanigans==

===Ickeriss tries out for the [[FCTC]]===
[[File:IckerissIrony.jpg|thumb|right|[http://il.youtube.com/watch?v=RaZh8VTY2qg&feature=related Project Chanology, I'm sorry, I really wish I could have been part of one of the raids...]]]
So basically this was Ickeriss' "[[LOLWUT|application]]" to join a (now defunct) collective of [[poser]] "trolls" on YouTube.  And yes, he was serious.  If you've ever had one of those moments where you actually felt embarrassed ''for'' someone else, this is essentially that, and probably something even Icky himself regrets doing, seeing as it was essentially the equivalent of trying out for the [[special|special olympics]].

[[File:IckyonTV.jpg|thumb|right|HAHA! GET IT?! Because of [[Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this|that guy]], and he said the thing... and now he's saying it ironically?! EPIN TROLL!"]]
Icky finds himself in one of the [[Fox News]] follow-ups (the one with [[smugfag]] crying about "cyber bullies"), '''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai09cWlyPrQ#t=1m15s blink and you'll miss it]'''. Appropos, they slid him in right before [[Dr4g0nK1d|another butthurt aspie]].  

<center><youtube>Ai09cWlyPrQ</youtube></center>
(1:15 marker)

===This Gets Worse, Too===
[[Image:NatureOfHumanity.png|thumb|right|Ladies and gentlemen, I give you....[[Fake|Anonymous]]!]]
At some point in the later half of 2008, Ickeriss got the [[Stupid|brilliant]] to don a [[ Project Chanology|V-mask]] and begin an [[Lame|epic]] campaign of trolling against targets such as [[furries]], [[emos]], [[attention whores]], and the like.  Otherwise known as the groups [[13 year old boy|13 year olds]] have had covered since the beginning of the internet.  To begin a career under the new identity "NatureofHumanity", he released the following video:
<center><youtube>Y62FKvuQgzI</youtube></center>
In the video, our [[Faggot|hero]] used a voice changer to [[Nice try|conceal his identity]].  Fortunately for us, [[Truth|Ickeriss is as dumb as a sack of potatoes]] and doesn't realize how easy it is to unmask a voice.
<center><youtube>vqVtgoTnN7I</youtube></center>
Now, you're saying to yourself "how could this get anymore pathetically hilarious".  The man who has already brought you [[Sick fuck|werewolf erotica]], [[Roleplay|vampire roleplay]], and [[Gay|delicious Joel McHale]] presents this gem for your consideration:
{{quote|An experiment shall we? Lets see how long it'll take for some one to read this and realize I'm a Female Anon.|NatureofHumanity}}
That's right.  Epic oldfag /b/tard king Ickeriss [[Moot|wants to be a little girl]].

===Moar===
To round up his YouTube trolling career, he ends off with this sad piece of drivel. Putting the last nail in the coffin of his side project, "The Kings Of The Streets".
<br/>
<center><youtube>VbSGZq4UyQ8</youtube></center>

===How Does I Ate Steak?===
More recently in his YouTube career, Ickeriss launched a one-man campaign (with some assistance from his fellow morons at [[Ickeriss69#Recent_Activity_with_Legi0n|Legi0n]]) to troll [[Onision]] and his fanbase of tree-hugging [[vegans]].  This doesn't seem like a difficult task.  But when Ickeriss and Legi0n are thrown into any mix, it inevitably devolves into a [[Special Olympics]].  His master plan: eat a steak and record it on video.  On the original upload, all of two [[butthurt]] fans commented.  Fucking [[Shitty|epic]].
<center><youtube>VP9rJuRpc8s</youtube></center>

==[[Lame|EPIN MEDALLION GET!]]==
{{Main|FCTC}}
[[File:IckyIsLegion.jpg|thumb|right|Icky is Leejun!]]
Ickeriss' crowning achievement, the day he came into possession of [[Chris chan]]s Sonichu medallions.

</center>

Lesser known, however, is the backstory of how Icky pulled off this epic ween, and just how much credit [[FCTC]] actually took from him. Originally orchestrated by FCTC member [[Fat|RickyRicardo123]], Icky was recruited to text chatting the manchild into demented cybersex in order to gain his trust. Icky did this about 3 times before getting bored and running off to write some more of his poetry, leaving NurseIckychan to phone chat with Chris long enough to convince him to mail off the treasured toys and hand out pictures of his dick. Icky decided to be the mighty troll to receive the awe-inspiring relics, and did what any ween troll would do; gave the address of a friend, convinced the friend to hand the pack over, and then went on YouTube and broke the medals on camera in an act of [[USI|epic, brilliant, and unparalleled trollin']].

However, right about this time, Icky, Ricky and the good nurse decided that, even though they had unreasonable control of FCTC in the first place and shared the pictures and information with the rest of FCTC every step along the way, they weren't quite happy that they wouldn't get '''''complete''''' credit and would instead have to share [[internet famous|e-fame]] with their group, and so intended to form a new, even better troll troupe alongside what would become [[Shit nobody cares about|the PVCC CWC troll crew]], where they would control hordes of newfags as undisputed Kings of Trolling. 

Unfortunately, FCTC had already dropped the pictures and claimed communal victory, unaware of the trio's plans for secession. Rage was had, crews were disbanded, and Ickeriss jumped ship to ride off the popularity of what would become the only thing resembling an accomplishment he would ever get (despite barely having fuck-all to with with himself...); [[Fail|tricking a retard into mailing him toys and breaking them on YouTube]].

An epic [[Loser|troll]] had been born.

==Icky's Unfortunate Incident==
[[Image:Picture_11.jpg|thumb|Ickeriss has the [[Pete Wentz|best]] [[Tim Buckley|idea]] ever.]]
[[File:IckysBentDong.png|thumb|right|An idea he's had several times before, apparently...]]
Sometime in the midst of all his [[Darksidered992|epic weeeeeeen!]] internet trolling, Ickeriss managed to wrangle him an internet girlfriend he met via trolling. By "met" in other words, he (along with some other [[otherkin|faggots]]) was recruited by her off of [[Vampirefreaks|Vampirefreaks.com]] for a troll group on a similar site, Dark Starlings. Suffice to say, some other members of said troll group (as well as the creater/admin of Dark Starlings) did not like the idea of having Icky in their group due to his being a [[truth|whiny, unfunny faggot]]. 

[[No|Astonishingly]], the relationship went awry. This can be attributed to the fact that Icky
*constantly begged for phone sex
*showed off his collection of blogs about wanting to cut himself and/or become an hero
*talked about wanting to marry this girl and get her pregnant (even though he hadn't even known her that long)
*Cried a lot
*[[Sick fuck|talk about how he imagined a t-rex would have sex]]
*was just generally creepy/weird 

Thus, Icky was [[lol|dumped on Christmas eve]] (but not before he sent the girl's son a "Baby [[Cthulhu]]" toy [[LOL WUT|as a christmas present]]). Down but not out, he sulked back to the internet to mend his broken soul. Until [[Brittany Holechko]] ([[srsly|seriously]], '''that''' Brittany Holechko) managed to contact said ex and obtain this series of [[Win|hilarious and telling]] voicemails, along with an impressive dossier of pictures of his pale bare ass he, as an epic troll, thought would be a sweet idea to send to a woman over the internet. That he met trolling. And was amazed when she handed over this embarrassing information, despite the fact that she dropped his shit in retaliation to his wanting to [[asshole|get her son taken away because he was butthurt over being dumped]]. A stunning lapse in judgment for what had prior been an [[Shit|amazing]] career.

{{fv|icky|background-color:#ffffff;|font-weight: bold;|

Surprisngly, this managed to kill the credibility of his career as an epic expert of Anon (as much expertise that comes with making a YouTube video "trolling" /b/'s flavor of the week, at least), thus began the mass blocking and [[Lolcow|calling everyone else butthurt]] over the event.

{{squote|OHH SHIT... OHHSHIT.....AHHH... AMANDA MANDA MANDA!|Icky struggling to orgasm}}" frame="true" position="center" allowfullscreen="true"/>
</center>
Among the things that Ickeriss's ex-e-girlfriend gave [[Brittany Holechko|IHM]] was a 30 second video of Icky [[masturbation|stroking his meat]] while namedropping said ex in orgasm. Of course, her dropping all of Michael's [[dox|personal media]] to his alleged kidnapper wasn't entirely unwarranted. If your ex-lover was threatening to have your kid taken away from you [[lol|because you dumped them]], you'd probably do the same.

=== Emails ===
Recently, email convos of Ickeriss and one of his ex's were released. Rather than help Michael's case though, they just give more insight into the workings of his [[retard|fucked up mind]].

===[[Fake|Kidnapping]]===

At some point in Mike's internet career, he was involved in an e-relationship with [[Brittany Holechko]] ([[It was a social experiment|only for trolling though!]]).  At some point during this relationship, a sex-starved Ickeriss decided he was willing to let the whale meet him IRL for some [[sex|quality time]].  Later, probably realizing how horribly he had fucked up, Icky developed an [[Ickeriss69/kidnapped|ingenious story]] about how Brittany [[lol wut|kidnapped]] and [[rape|forced herself upon]] him.

{{quote|[[Brittany Holechko|It]] walked in. It had pulled the curtain away. I looked up. It was [[DO NOT WANT|naked and bloated]]. Whole strips of the legs, unshaven. Pimples and blemished skin everywhere. In an instant, a Captain Morgan pose was formed, a tampon was pulled from between the legs, blood splatting out as if a knife was pulled from a wound.

I knew what the dead lights were all about. The moment of absolute horror striking ones soul.

Baby, I want you.|Michael Lotz, [[lie|master storyteller]] (full text of the story [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Ickeriss69/kidnapped here])}}

This totally [[bullshit|believable]] story would probably hold up if not for these telling emails he exchanged with Brittany.

<center><gallery>
Image:Ickyemail1.png|Preparing for the hambeast's arrival.
Image:Ickyemail2.png|The aftermath.
</gallery></center>

When Icky found out about these embarrassing emails that he had previously insisted were a bluff on Brittany's part (and that he had only talked to her on MSN), he went on to [[lie|claim that the emails were faked]] because "the dates were wrong" and that he "didn't have internet at the time". Despite this claim, [[fail|the dates on the emails match up with the dates mentioned in Icky's tl;dr kidnapping story]]. Of course, this was all part of an elaborate and complex troll that [[you]] are just too lame to understand.

===Voicemail-gate 2: [[Electric Boogaloo]]===

Not long after his [[ragequit|downfall]] at Legi0n, Ickeriss once again suffered from [[dying alone|relationship problems]].  Apparently, during his tenure at legi0n he leaked [[dox|sensitive information]] on a [[trap|girlfriend]] of his to a group of trolls including [[Cyanterrorist]].  Like all of Icky's complex and elaborate plans, this worked out perfectly.
<center><youtube>mzhZHQjMEqI</youtube></center>
Fucking perfectly, I tell ya.

=== Icky Threatens Dox ===

Continuing the embarrassing chain started in the previous set of voicemails, Icky decided it would be an excellent idea to [[HAHAHA, OH WOW|call the same girl in the middle of the night to inform him of his plans to dox Cyanterrorist and another troll]] (3:03 in the video).

[[butthurt|Ashamed and down on his luck]], Ickeriss has taken a permavacation from YouTube due to being butthurt from fellow trolls. Recently Ickeriss has been getting on Helldive (anus eal's network) [[emo|crying]] about how he is going to get revenge on [[user:subseven|subseven]] for stealing his gf and lying about [[sex|what really happened]] with [[Brittany Holechko]]. Feeling pity, some faggot named [[user:VanKrause|krappleguy]] immediately thought he could put Mikes time tested skills of blocking people and deleting comments he didn't like to work, and gave Ickeriss Admins privileges to his imageboard, [http://legi0n.789chan.org/cwc/ Legi0n]. Legi0n is where Michael spends most of his days now, since as he has complete control of said board, he can happily hide away from his shameful actions and groom a horde of mouth breathing Chris-chan enthusiasts into worshipping him as a medallion destroying God among men under the alias [[Team Fortress 2|'''Medic''']]. Coincidentally, [[powerword|"Ickeriss']] happens to be completely wordfiltered off the boards and most criticism of him results in an instant permaban. [[Lie|Not because he's butthurt about anything though. It's simple clean up, you understand]]. When one's immersed in the delicate and subtle art of managing a board about fat autistics, one must cover the details.

Despite being such an epic troll well worth his accolades and position of power, [[Bawwwww|Ickeriss just can't seem to handle the pressure of running a medium-sized chan]], and has several times recruited for [[bottom|subordinates]]. The [[shit|very careful]] selection of who gets to be a mod on Leejun would usually follow a very simple pattern. A "regular" poster on the board would catch Ickeriss's eye, [[User:Ryal|said poster]] would be invited to the irc channel by Icky, who would then ask the poster if they used [[skype]]. The poster would then be invited to a skype conference with Ickeriss and his circlejerking friends. Then Ickeriss, in his [[USI|infinite knowledge]], would deem the individual to be a [[pretty cool guy]] and would ask the person if they wanted [[banhammer|mod power]] on Leejun.

<center>{{bigpic|freemodship.jpg|600|300|Medic's reign of terror in a nutshell.}}</center>


Mike has his hands full on /cwc/, so don't go doing anything rude like posting pictures of his dick and his tearful voicemails to his ex on there to ruin his faggot little cult of personality he's obtained or anything like that, or he'll just have to break out his troll skillz and call [[u mad]].

[[Epin]] moderation in action:

=== Icky's appeal to Girlvinyl ===
It can be assumed that Michael probably knew he'd be [[owned|getting an ED page soon]] so in November 2009, he decided to take it upon himself to suck up to [[Girlvinyl]] by offering to [[trying too hard|give her one of Chris-chan's medallions]].

{{squote|ja, medallions are more or less up for grabs (besides black one, mine) but first I wanted to offer Girlvinyl any of the medallions (again, besides blacky) due to 5 years of ED coming up. I figured, 5 years of lulz is worth one evil artifact of the nets.

Some how I can see it being taken as an insult (how would you react to a random fucking douche bag offering you a 27 year old retards hand crafted medallion for running a fucking wiki for 5 years?)|Icky doing it wrong}}

Girlvinyl ended up getting the 'decoy' medallion that [[Chris-chan]] made. Once Mike's ED page went online however, he began openly [[irony|stating how he thinks ED is cancer]].

=== Computer mouse plz ===
At one point, Ickypoo was brought into a skype call with an attention-whoring, fellow otherkin known as [http://demoness-crystallia.deviantart.com Shadow Phantom]. In this skype call, Ickeriss took it upon himself to put his [[no|expert womanizing skills]] to the test and [[lol wut|told Shadow Phantom that he would pay her if she read off her erotic fanfictions]]. The final straw was when Icky got another [[fail|epic]] idea and told his fellow lulzcow to [[sick fuck|stick a computer mouse up her ass]]. Ickeriss's antics of course did not go unnoticed as Shadow Phantom [[butthurt|ragequite]] skype and proceeded to [[bawww]] on a [[furfag|sonic the hedghog forum]].

<center>{{bigpic|spispissedatickypoo.png|600|300}}</center>
{{quote|I'm totally willing to fill that christ-hole with my troll gelly|Ickeriss trying to be suave}}
Ickeriss of course decided to keep persuing Shadow Phantom and followed her onto the forum.


=== DDoS Drama ===
Ickeriss's [[USI|cocky attitude]] had gotten [[Legi0n|Leejun]] DDoS'd on numerous occasions, but the most notable was when his faggotry came to the attention of [[skiddies|EZBake]]. Basically, Icky's then e-girlfriend had become good friends with an EZBake skiddie known as [[User:Garrettisvuln|garrett]]. This of course infuriated the [[faggot|beautiful archfiend]], as he apparently [[Chris-chan|does not want whatever woman he is with to have any male friends]]. So Icky decided to run his big mouth at garrett in a fit of jealousy. Garrett responded to this childish behavior by not only DDoSing Leejun, but packeting Icky and knocking him offline.

While the preceding irc chat was going on, an internet-less Ickeriss called up Krapple on the phone and in a fit of [[lol|spastic nerd rage]], Began bawwing about getting packeted and how he wanted to get garrett [[FBI|v&]]. Once the drama had died down, Ickeriss '''offered''' (YES, OFFERED) to pay for the DDOS damages from the previous night. When all was said and done, Icky had earned himself a [[troll shielding|seemingly perminant admin position]] on the boards due to his [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|generous monetary contribution for a DDoS attack that was his fault in the first place]].


==="FUCK OFF, DICK!"===
[[File:ArmyofMedics.png|thumb|right|Legi0n onto Icky's shit.]]
In Mid August 2010, Ickeriss's faggotry on Leejun had reached it's boiling point. The final straw was when Mike decided it would be great to [[Alex Wuori|personal army]] the site by [[fail|posting nudes of his ex and pictures of her child]] on Leejun's "[[lolcows]]" board. When said images were removed, Icky decided to colorfully respond to this [[sarcasm|lulzkilling]].

{{quote|stop deleting shit I do you fucking faggot|Icky handling things like a [[manchild|true professional]]}}

Icky then proceeded to repost his personal army/butthurt thread, only to have it deleted again.
On August 13, 2010, Ickeriss said that he was gonna start paying for the site, effectively making him the owner (he had also told SeanieB and some others about [[Unrealistic expectations|how he wanted to remove Krapple and take over the site]]). However, [[User:VanKrause|Krapple]] finally had enough of Icky's [[faggotry]] and [[pwnd|removed his admin powers on legi0n]].

{{quote|don't ever fucking ask for my help again faggot|Icky's final words to one of the Leejun admins before he fucked off to sulk and slit his wrists}}

==After Exile==

After ruining Legi0n and having what was left of his support group more than ready to want him gone, Ickeriss did the smart thing and proceed to garner even more attention of himself. To prove them wrong, of course. 

==="I hope you get AIDS in your dick"===
[[Image:ickysfalsedmca.png|thumb|Icky is totally [[lie|not butthurt]].]]
Not content with merely one display of emotional indignation, Ickeriss again displayed his voicemail proficiency and left his former Legi0n cohorts a seething message, [[irony|letting them know outright that they were newfags (in his /b/ mask)and homosexuals (while masturbating to The Soup reruns)]].

<center><youtube>Goz49BG4ZQg</youtube></center>

Ickeriss apparently [[butthurt|did not appreciate his voicemail rantings being posted]] on Youtube so he did the only logical thing he could do and had the video [[delete fucking everything|taken down]]. Unfortunately, Icky doesn't know that the internet doesn't forget.

==="Hey Guys [[I accidentally|I Intentionally Christian Weston Chandler]]"===
[[File:IckyKillsCWCTrolling.jpg|thumb|right|He totally did. Killed it dead.]]
After his controversial yet simultaneously uneventful stint as Fuhrer and Greatest Liability of Legi0n, Ickeriss decided to lead an insurrection against his former cohorts. Not unlike [[Christian|Satan]] and his rebellion against God, the Beautiful Archfiend had attempted to gather his minions from /cwc/ and destroy Legi0n from the inside. Too bad for Icky, his boys in Legi0n weren't entirely appreciative of how his douchebaggery led them [[lulz|straight to the attention of Encyclopedia Dramatica]], and Michael was forced to avenge his second fall from grace alone. Infuriated and desperate, Ickeriss decided he had only one option left; if he couldn't rule over the CWCfags, he would [[Nice try|destroy Chris-chan trolling completely]].

Blaming his humiliation on those with considerable sway in the world of autistic stalking, Icky made it clear that during his tenure with Legi0n and involvement with said 'tard baiting that he knew dark and terrifying secrets that, if exposed to those closest to Mr. Chandler (specifically his church counselor), would tear the world of Chris-chan enthusiasts apart irreparably, and made a list of demands in order to keep the terrible secret under wraps; [[All|most]] of which included removing all unflattering videos of him from YouTube and returning the respect he gained from <strike>moderating</strike>hanging around on /cwc/. Ickeriss had it all planned out. Knowing trolls couldn't possibly bear the loss of a [[No|lulz icon]], they would have to give into his demands, lest lose the greatest source of comedy gold ever!

Except that [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|he wasn't even entirely sure that it was Legi0n and other assorted CWCfags leaking the embarrassing details in the first place]]. And that everyone and their [[Wolfeedarkfang|dead grandmother]] have attempted [[raid|anything]] and [[SWAT|everything]] to troll the Chandlers and that anyone approaching them with [[Shit nobody cares about|"damning information"]] would be ignored without second thought. And that, on the off chance they ''did'' listen to him, he would then have to explain [[Raid Backfire|why there was video of himself online gleefully destroying Christian's stolen property on YouTube]]. And that historically [[Alex Wuori|people that have tried to counter-raid imageboards out of butthurt indignation end up buried by said boards]]. In addition to his long, long track record of [[Fail|basically just fucking up ever single thing he's ever attempted to pull off fucking ever]]. [[Evar|Ever]].

But yeah, if you're pissed off wondering why there's never anything new going on with Chris-chan lately, Ickeriss wants you to know he was totally responsible for that. Feel free to [[rape|show your appreciation]].

===A Desperate, Angry Boy Runs Out of Ideas===

In a bizarre episode, Ickeriss recently stooped to contacting former Legi0n cohorts and assaulting their voicemail with songs by [[WHEN I WAS|My Chemical Romance]] and [[Fuckin Magnets|Insane Clown Posse]], clearly under the impression that this was the most logical way to count the assertion he was a meme spouting crybaby loser.

== Icky's Unfortunate Incident (part II) ==
[[Image:ickylosthismask.jpg|thumb|Successful troll is successful.]]
Sometime [[last thursday|in October 2010]], Ickeriss's ex who dumped him on Christmas eve 2008 and dropped his shit to IHM returned and approached him. She proclaimed that despite being married to [[User:Subseven|Subseven]], she still had feelings for Icky. Of course Michael, being the clingy, gullible imbecile that he is, bought into the lie. Well, part of him did. The other part wanted to get revenge and thus decided that he would play along [[nice try|and then tell Subseven that he was being cheated on]]. Icky however, was unaware that Subseven (as well as a few of Icky's ex-leejun buddies and a more recent ex of his) were in on this trolling scheme. Notably, Icky's more recent ex sent Icky's /b/ mask to his previous ex. It has been alleged that the mask [[DO NOT WANT|has a rancid stench to it when worn]]. 

=== A Michael Lotz Christmas ===
The initial trolling by Icky's ex ended in November 2010 when Icky got fed up with being [[trolled|cockteased]]. Then on Christmas eve 2010, all that had been gathered on Icky was dropped. Among the things dropped was a large number of pictured ranging from text messages to [[stop posting|more n00dz]].

<pictures will go here later>

==== MOAR FAPPING ====
<center>
<video type="slutload" id="jHUf1XFsHff" width="400" height="300" frame="true" position="center" allowfullscreen="true"/>
</center>
Once again, Icky proved that he just can't keep his pale-as-fuck phallus in his trousers and [[retard|fapped on cam]] for his ex. What Ickeriss didn't know was that [[win|his fap session was being recorded]]. So in short, [[loser|Ickeriss was tricked into fapping on cam, only to have a video of it dropped on the 2 year aniversery of his internet girlfriend dumping him.]]

== "Hey Guys I Intentionally Christian Weston Chandler" (part II) ==
Not content with all the negative attention he'd already received and butthurt about his famous, [[fail|epic]] Sonichu medallion videos [[trolled|getting removed]] from his Youtube channel, Ickeriss decided to once again make the Chris-chan trolling community the target of his [[13 year old boy|crybaby tantrums]]. This time around, Icky felt it necessary to threaten a [http://youtube.com/thecwcvillelibrary Youtube channel] that mirrors Chris-chan's videos with the possibility of DMCA takedowns. Why would an epic [[fag|troll]] like Ickeriss do this you might ask? Well, because this Youtube channel dared mirror his [[shit|precious]] medallion videos.
{{quote|The person you spoke to about allowing you to upload my [[engrish|video's]] and I had an arrangement concerning you being allowed to keep that video up. That arrangement is pretty void. So I would appreciate it as opposed to having to file the DMCA's.

== Theme Song ==
<center>I wanna be<br/>
The very best<br/>
Like no troll ever was<br/>
To amass a personal army is my quest<br/>
To sell them bullshit is my cause<br/>
I will travel across the Tubes<br/>
Searching far and wide<br/>
Each chanfag nerd to not understand<br/>
That my accomplishments are lies<br/>

Ickeriss!<br/>
It's you and me<br/>
Grew up with Dei in Germany<br/>
Ickeriss!<br/>
Oh I have no friends<br/>
From the truth I must defend<br/>
Ickeriss!<br/>
What I told legi0n wasn't true<br/>
But my shit, they did not see through<br/>
You'll dump me and I'll cry to you<br/>
Ickeriss<br/>
Gotta troll 'em all!<br/>

Every challenge along the way<br/>
With a /b/ mask on my face<br/>
I will battle every day<br/>
To claim my rightful place<br/>
Kidnap me, the time is right<br/>
There's no better team<br/>
On my own chan I lost the fight<br/>
On your voicemail I will scream<br/></center>
