Ron Kind is a [[Democratic]] [[politician]] representing the state of [[Shit nobody cares about|Wisconsin]] as a member of the [[Amerifag]] House of Representatives.  He's had his ass there ever sins 1997. If you've ever heard of Wisconsin in your lifetime, you probably have a pretty good idea of what he's all about. 

Ronny has voiced his support for both abortion and stem cell research, which will allow him to build an army of clones and dominate the world with mutated fetuses. After occupying the majority of North America, [[Republican]] theorists speculate that he might impose some sort of [[Nazi|Nazi-Germany]] and [[Socialist]] fusion, being that he is a [[Democrat]], and will force all of the young boys and girls to read [[Harry Potter]] to initiate them into the occult. Once the western world is under his control, it is assumed he will legalize marijuana, bring the [[banhammer]] down on [[jesus]], sign homosexuality into law, and spend the rest of his regime watching old men [[fap]] in his chambers.

Some of the issues important to Rep. Kind are as follows:

*Spending taxpayers money on [[sex]] Instead of our [[semen|Troops]] in [[Iraq]].

*Research to study the sex lives of [[Tila Tequila|Vietnamese prostitutes]] and the [[masturbation]] habits of elderly [[fucktards]]. 

*Spending [[you]]'re tax dollars to study the [[bisexual]], [[Ann Coulter|trans Gendered]] AND [[Otherkin|two-spirited]] Aleutian Eskimos.

*Spending tax dollars to [[whores|pay]] [[16 year old girls]] to watch [[porn]] with [[Giant dildo of death|probes]] connected to their 
genitalia

During the 2006 elections, Ron Kind was face with a new challenger: Paul R. Nelson. In a feat of pure lulz, Paul endorsed ads that accused Ron Kind of everything from studying prostitution and masturbating, to terrorists and [[WTC]]. 

The actual study in question that the ad purports is about studying the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes, it fails to mention that the underlying intent of the study is to gain more information about the spread of [[AIDS]]. It should also be noted that Kind voted to keep funding the research by the National Institutes of Health, and had zero influence over [[Buttsex|the studies they chose to conduct]]. If nothing else, this only proves that he is a heretic because everyone knows [[Fred Phelps|god created AIDS to punish us all for the fags]]. 

Oh and that part about the masturbating old men? That study was done in 1980. Entirely for the lulz.  

Its fairly simple to glean the gist of the two videos in a couple of sentences: Ron Kind is a [[sick fuck]] who loves [[Mexico]] and hates [[you]]. But what kind of scathing adds was Ron firing back with?

That is what it takes to win an election in Wisconsin... 

The results: The cheesefags chose [[handegg]] and prostitutes over [[batshit insane]] and fear. They'll regret it when he carries out his newest study: the effects of [[rape]] on Alzheimer patients.
