'''Chevy the Therapy Dog''' was a 4-year old Australian Shepherd cross belonging to probable [[aspie]] Crystal Brown.

==The Story==
[[Image:Have you seen my dog.jpg|thumb|300px|This is [[some argue|believed]] to have been the poster used to try and find Chevy.]]

After disappearing for a brief period, faithful Chevy showed up on Crystal's doorstep. Well, some of him, anyway.

"I told him everything and he never shared any of my secrets," said Crystal, 17, who has had some troubled times in her young life. Chevy was her "therapy dog", and she leaned on him for comfort and support.

Shirley Brown found the box first, wrapped in alluring red paper on her front steps, with batteries taped to the box. "[[You win the prize|Congratulations]] Crystal," the note said. "This side up. Batteries included." 

Shirley Brown placed the box on her granddaughter's bedroom dresser. "I was surprised and excited," Crystal said. "I thought it was a gift from my cousin." She tore off the paper and ripped open the box. Inside the box was a selection of [[Delicious cake|delicious Valentine's Day candy]], and a black garbage bag. 

'''[[Lulz|And then she saw her dog's face.]]'''

==St. Paul's Finest==

Homicide investigators are looking into the case because of the "implied" [[terrorism|terrorist threat]], St. Paul Police Sgt. Jim Gray said. Sgt Jim Gray obviously has caught all of the [[Nigras|rapists]], [[Jews|murderers]] of actual people and [[spics|heroin traffickers]] in St. Paul, and now has all the time in the world to run after an (arguably epic) [[IRL troll]].

==Life Without [[Bestiality]]==

"I felt empty," Crystal said of the gaping void in her vagina where trusty Chevy's knot once took pride of place. "I couldn't talk to anyone. He was my dog. [[Dying Alone|It was just me and him."]]

"That dog didn't care what I did, what I didn't do...what anyone did to me. He didn't care about any of that. [[Bestiality|He just wanted to love me the way I loved him."]]

==LiveJournal Drama Ensues==
Posted to LiveJournal's [http://wtf_inc.livejournal.com WTF Inc LiveJournal community], the general consensus was that the person responsible for the beheading should face the [[banhammer|death penalty]]. {{lj|user=mordant}} begged to differ. Butthurt ensued.

==[[Moar]] LiveJournal Drama Ensues==
Unsatisfied with the hysterical berating of {{lj|user=mordant}} on wtf_inc, some of his statements are [[cross-posted]] to to high-brow Superiority Club Stupid_Free. [[User:Hoveround|Mordant]] proceeded to exhibit [[unwarranted self-importance]] whilst displaying his [[e-penis]] for all to be repulsed by.

==An Epic Love Story </3==
According to an [http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_082070159.html Old as fuck article] the alleged killer has been caught, and has turned out to be none other then Crystal Brown's [[terrorist|Mexican]] ex-boyfriend. Of course this was an obvious attempt to get back at her for cheating on him with the dog, the slut that she is.

"It felt like a car was sitting on our chests and now it's off," Shirley Brown told The Associated Press. "It's just unbelievable."

'''Yeah that's because the dogs no longer on top of your chest with its balls down your throat.'''

"Crystal now has a new puppy, named Diesel, and Shirley Brown said they are bonding after just a few short weeks."

'''DIESEL, NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!'''

"That dog's only 10 weeks old, and she's already got him sitting up and shaking hands," Shirley Brown said. "That's just Crystal -- she's always [[Bestiality|loved animals]]."
