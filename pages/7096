'''Rubber Johnny''' is a video showing off a [[retarded]] teenager with a water head who has the voice of an [[Pedophile|infant]] to promote a <strike>band</strike> lunatic crackhead musician that's seriously [[fucked up]] in the head (Aphex Twin).

Because of the creepiness and poor home movie quality of the video, a <s>bunch of [[retards]]</s> [[noone]] thought it was a real video.

== [[Shit nobody cares about|The synopsis of this garbage]] ==
Basically, it's just some [[earrape]] compiled together with [[Sony Vegas|shitty editing softwarez]] to make this garbage. It starts out with this [[Cripple|wheeltard]] invoking in an act of [[Autism|incomprehensible babbling]] to this [[House|doctor]]...or something. [[Nobody cares|Noone knows!!!1!1]]

After that, he goes apeshit over [[CP|God knows what,]] and that's the cue to make the video even more fucked then it already was. [[Lazy|To sum it up:]] [[Drugs|gets high,]] [[Rape|Father comes in,]] and the shit's over. Then we see some terribly shot footage of a [[1chan|train]], and [[A winner is you|congratulations!]] You wasted a good 6 minutes of your life, [[Faggot|faggot!]]
