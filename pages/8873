'''''WWII Online''''', A.K.A. ''"Battleground Europe"'', A.K.A. ''"World War Two Online"'', A.K.A. "Oh Shit! We should have got the name right the first time", is a [[MMORPG]] known to not only [[pwn]] [[Shit|Windows-based PCs]] but also [[Faggotry|Apple Macs]], people's [[Irl|IRL]] lives, and even relationships. It was programmed by Cornered Rat Studios for the lulz. People actually pay for it monthly - which is really quite lulzworthy in itself. It describes itself as a [[World_War_2|World War Two]]-era [[wtf|MMOFPS]] with MMORPG elements. However, everyone knows it's a 150mb Trojan designed to kill you. 

==History==
[[100_years_ago | Some time ago]], Cornered Rat Studios ran out of weed and needed to do something creative. They decided to code the lamest excuse for an online [[FPS]] game since [[Counter-Strike]]. On release, the game was so buggy that it gave birth to insects and even started to smell of rancid excrement. Once downloaded and installed, there was no escape and thousands of mostly neo-[[Nazi]] [[Eurofags]] fell for the [[anal]] intrusion. As the years went by the game received constant updates from an invisible hive mind. Cornered Rat Studios have since been found, skinned alive, and thrown into cellars filled with salt over this crime against users of the tubes. 

''WWII Online'' now flourishes thanks to the number of fat, neo-Nazi [[basement dwellers]] who are willing to play it. They pay $14.99 a month because they believe the money is funding the underground Fourth Reich.

The bottom line with ''WWII Online'' is, [[Lie|that in reality it was the first true MMOFPS game to hit the internet. It also boasts a level of combined-arms, teamwork orientated, tactical planning and combat that remains unrivalled by any other game. It's for mature, patient gamers willing to be a part of a large-scale battle and commit to a long, realistic campaign. It's also totally persistent; meaning all victories or defeats will have an impact on the outcome of the war - and alter the front lines appropriately]]. Wait, no. It is actually shit because like, "WHERE IS MY M1 GARAND!!!!1111 OMG11 ThiS GamME SucKZz! I PreferR ''Medal of HONor'' on my playstation!1" - anonymous [[13 year-old boy|13 year-old gamer]].

==Types of Players==
[[Image:World_war_2_online_1.jpg|thumb|right| Tank road block, lulz.]]
*'''[[Nazi]]''' - The majority of ''WWII Online'' players, they will always play as the [[Germans]] and form clans like "The 7th SS" and "Armored Core". They will drive tanks and will spend 5 hours a day on average arguing on the game forums over [[Suicide|why Germany lost the war]].

*'''N00b''' - Anyone who plays as the allies in this game is a n00b by association. Regardless of skill, allied players are n00bs, apparently.

*'''[[Mac]] User''' - Players who are running ''WWII Online'' via a [[Mac]] so therefore insist on maintaining the moral high ground. Instead of actually playing the game they will often just get into arguments on the talk bar channels, trying to [[Intellectual_checkmate|intellectually checkmate]] PC gamers with their pretentious Mac bullshit. 

*'''[[Hax|H@XXor]]''' - Anyone who manages to kill you in ''WWII Online'' must apparently be a "haxxor". This is because, unless they were hacking, it would have been impossible for them to have killed you. 

*'''Clan player''' - Clans try to organize things in this game, but I mean... what's the point? Clan players are willing to take orders from either Nazis or whiny [[13 year-old boy|13 year-old]] Eastern Europeans on shitty Dells [[Lol|whose connections keep dropping]].

==How Battles Play Out==
[[Image:Paratroops.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boring|Super-exciting gameplay!]]]]
1) Allies attempt to attack a German held town.

2) Allies are repelled, beaten back to FBs (forward bases) and then mostly log out crying on the talk bar: "I am quiting this shitty game", only to log back on again later to do it all again. 

3) Nazis jerk off about their "OMG!!!L33t" victory and continue reading ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' with one hand whilst stroking their rods with the other. 

4) Allied air support arrives late, players whine some more on global channels, and everyone blames the [[mods]].


'''Or'''

Germans attack a town and take it due to the lack of Allied players defending...
