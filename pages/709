'''Autoplay''' (also known as '''&autoplay=1''') is an overused wiki function that is an annoyance akin to [[strikethrough]]; it's an easy way to [[shit nobody cares about|gain views on your channel]] and earn a swift [[ban|kick in the nuts]] from [[sysops|angry, old fucks]]. Either that, or [[DO NOT WANT|your edit will be reverted]] by some [[no life|editor who constantly views]] the [[Recent changes]] page like a hungry hawk looking for some prey. Here on [[ED]], the only place where you can hope to have autoplay without it being removed is within your own userspace.

As obnoxious as it is annoying, autoplay is not exclusive to wikis. Autoplay is used on blogs, social networking sites and YouTube user pages (all leaving [[everyone|many]] with [[nerd rage]]). Either way, [[Troll|you're going to piss off a lot of people with it wherever you go.]]

==When is it neccessary?==
[[Image:Man-yelling-at-computer.jpg|thumb|How most people react to autoplay.]]
'''[[Never]]''', and it never will be. As much as you want a page with autoplay, it is never needed. Pages with autoplay embedded in usually result in the viewer either:
#clicking the back button
#mute the volume
#pausing the video
Option number one is the most selected of the three. Although autoplay is never necessary nor needed, the exceptions are '''[[Template:3500|3500]]''', and the [[Kawaii|cutest]] page on ED: '''[[Kittens]]'''. Of course, in the realms of [[JewTube]], many people figure using autoplay in their channel will gather [[attention whore|more views]]. On the contrary, there would be no point considering nobody cares about that person's shitty [[AMV]] of Naruto with [[Linkin Park]] playing at full volume. In conclusion, it would leave another shit account in the cesspool of YouTube.

And then there's [[MySpace]] (lol, does anybody have one nowadays?), which was a popular haven for the use of autoplay on the internet. Amongst tweens, it was abused beyond recognition with their [[Lady Gaga]] or [[Soulja Boy]] songs that any other normal person with a decent taste in music couldn't stand. But to no surprise, anyone who isn't an attention-thriving [[12 year old girl]] or some horrible [[Indie]] band hoping to [[Unrealistic Expectations|achieve stardom with the use of MySpace]] have already moved onto to other social networking websites like [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]] where they can whore themselves and stalk people more conveniently. [[Truth|Besides, MySpace was no good from the start (nor were its competitors)]].

Of course, autoplay can also be used for trolling by using some [[earrape]] material which subsequently may generate lulz.

==How Do I Autoplayed?==
So you want to know how to embed autoplay within ED? Be warned, as you most likely will get reverted for your faggotry. Repeat offenders can possibly generate an edit war with an result in which could possibly end you getting [[banhammered]]. But then again, it's perfectly okay to spam articles with autoplay '''outside of''' [[ED]] onto other inferior wikis such as [[TOW]] and [[Uncyclopedia]].

===Normal Autoplay===
<nowiki><video type="youtube" id="</nowiki>'''[insert the YouTube video ID code; which comes after "/watch?v="]'''<nowiki>"&autoplay=</nowiki>'''1'''&loop='''0'''<nowiki>" height="</nowiki>'''[x]'''<nowiki>" width="</nowiki>'''[x]'''<nowiki>" position="" frame="false" /></nowiki>
====Start from Elsewhere Besides the Beginning====
Simply put "&start='''[the time you want the video to start at]'''" right before or after "'''&autoplay=1'''"

===Autoplay with Loop===
<nowiki><video type="youtube" id="</nowiki>'''[insert the YouTube video ID code; which comes after "/watch?v="]'''<nowiki>"&autoplay=</nowiki>'''1'''&loop='''1'''<nowiki>" height="</nowiki>'''[x]'''<nowiki>" width="</nowiki>'''[x]'''<nowiki>" position="" frame="false" /></nowiki>

===Looped Audio===
<nowiki><div style="visibility:hidden"><video type="youtube" id="[insert the YouTube video ID code; which comes after "/watch?v="]&autoplay=1&loop=1" height="1" width="1" position:"left" frame:"false" /></div></nowiki>
</div>

==Worthy Drama-causing Material==
[[Image:YTapDrama.PNG|thumb|center|750px|[[Common knowledge|They always end up coming right back.]]]]
If you insist on using autoplay, you might as well use some troll-worthy material. Example usually consist of intentionally annoying (unintentional [[A cat is fine too|is fine too]]) songs, audio remixed to [[Earrape|G-Major]], or maximum volume audio. Or you could always [[cuntpaste]] a video/song 50 times.

<center>{{fv|earrape|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold; |<video type="youtube" id="1YeGcj_P03A&autoplay=0&loop=1&start=1&" height="25" width="30" position="center" desc="Am" />|<video type="youtube" id="qc9JlPHPMfI&autoplay=0&loop=1&start=1&" height="25" width="30" position="center" desc="I" />|<video type="youtube" id="DBc5bJ6ls-0&autoplay=0&start=22&loop=1" height="25" width="30" position="center" desc="raeping" />|<video type="youtube" id="Ht8I5JjnxSo&autoplay=0&loop=1&start=1&" height="25" width="30" position="center" desc="your" />|<video type="youtube" id="k2VVqsCS55U&autoplay=0&loop=1&start=1&" height="25" width="30" position="center" desc="ears" />|<video type="youtube" id="KGD-mFTY6mw&autoplay=0&loop=1&start=1&" height="25" width="30" position="center" desc="yet?" />|<video type="youtube" id="oQkrSzCRW_k&autoplay=0&loop=1&start=1&" height="25" width="30" position="center" desc="No?" />|<video type="youtube" id="ROnp44hNeOk&autoplay=0&loop=1&start=1&" height="25" width="30" position="center" desc="How" />|<video type="youtube" id="iclvAdB2Lgs&autoplay=0&loop=1&start=1&" height="25" width="30" position="center" desc="About" />|<video type="youtube" id="PTC3EMV5rbc&autoplay=0&loop=1&start=1&" height="25" width="30" position="center" desc="Now?" />}}</center>

Remember, the longer and louder it is the higher your probability of trolling will be. Additionally, getting rid of the ability of the pause/play controls also generates more rage. [[No|Please use with care!]]

==Methods of Disabling Autoplay==
[[File:Computer-throwing-window-out-stupid-monitor.jpg|thumb|160px|[[The Final Solution]].]]
Usually, the easiest method of disabling autoplay is through the pause button. There are, however, times when one will [[troll]] you with a page where there are no way to stop the [[madness]]. [[You]] don't want to click the back button because you're too interested in a page only [[Shit nobody cares about|you would care about]]. You can always mute the volume, but you don't want your [[Gay|precious]] songs of the [[Jonas Brothers]] playing on iTunes to be muted as well. Lucky for you there are better ways of turning off autoplay and for good.

Take note that if you still use [[Internet Explorer]] (people still use that?) you will still be [[raeped]] in the ass by autoplay. The main technique for you to disable autoplay is to download an extension for browsers such as [[Google Chrome]] or [[Mozilla Firefox]]. But then again, since Chrome does a shitty job at blocking ads, you can probably expect the same to occur with autoplay. 

Or you can always just throw your computer out the window.
