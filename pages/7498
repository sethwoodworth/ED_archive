'''[http://ShutdownED.org ShutdownED.org]''' is a painfully [[lame]] yet [[heart]]-rending anti-ED site.  Unfortunately the [[Bureaucratic Fucks| self-righteous]] little [[turd]] concerned doesn't even reveal his [[Wikipedia Admin Gallery| secret wikipedia identity]], although he seems to have damnably [http://www.penny-arcade.com/images/2005/20051216h.jpg terrifying powers]. 

If you're big enough to have a site dedicated to hating you, does that mean you've arrived, already? If you listen to all the [[fags]] on [[TOW]], the answer is [[no]], because of [[Shit nobody cares about | WP:V]] and [[gay | WP:NOR]].

===Why shut down ED?===

The requested reason why shut down ed was not found on this server.

Additionally, a NOBODY GIVES A SHIT error was encountered while trying to use an IdiocityDocument to handle the request.

===Guestbook===
ShutdownED.org also has a shitty [[fan_sign|guestbook]] that is brimming with [[faggotry]] and [[fail]] where members of the [[basement_dwellers|e-public]] can use as a petition to show their [[butthurt|enmity]]. 

Also of note, a number of the signers claimed to be [[victim]]s of the [[RFJason CL Experiment]]. [[A Plus|A+++++++++++++++++++++++]].

Only [[spambot]]s give a shit about ShutDownED anymoar. This is evidenced by how any outpourings of those who believe they have suffered serious [[butthurt]] (real or imagined) by the juggernaut that is ED are swamped under automated ads for "[[Paris Hilton]] Naked", "Interest Free Home Loans", [[Viagra]], and "Nude Teens", just to name a few. Why? Because [[noone]] actually cares these days, and the consensus is that all these miserable shits should retreat back to their [[hugbox]] or Skinner Boxes, thus relieving the Internets of a great and terrible responsibility.

==Quotes from the Guestbook==

'''Ronald Reese''':   "Hello, I would like to see the ED people shot as we Wikipedias parade with their bodies, dancing in the middle of the streets. Fuck you, ED."

'''Linuxbeak''':   "I would like to see ED cease to exist. They have personally attacked me and sent people to harass me at my dorm and have orchestrated harassment over the phone as well. This center for libel and harassment needs to be shut down. I hope you succeed in your misson, please let me know if I may help in any way."  

'''/b/''': "This is the essence of /b/ speaking: $18million Interawebs in non-sequential, unmarked GBs deposited with Tiger (Caturday) Tom: http://www.tigertom.com/offshore-bank-account.shtml will cement our 'friendship' (no nuance face). Once verified...life's a funny 'ole dog, isn't it."  

'''TopMich''': "Thanks discount airline tickets cheap flights cheap flights cheap flights discount air tickets airline tickets airlines airline ticket airline discount tickets cheap flights malaysia airline tickets air tickets cheap airline tickets london cheap airline tickets air line tickets dirt cheap airline tickets cheap LOL PENIS SIZE airline tickets air plane tickets airline last minute ticket cheap air line tickets cheap airline tickets london airline discount ticket military air cheap ticket travel first class low cost airline tickets cheap airline ticket dirt cheap airline tickets cheap international air tickets cheap flights cheap air tickets cheapest airline tickets asia airline tickets cheap international airline tickets really cheap airline tickets airline tickets cheap air ticket"

'''Stud''': "Is this where I sign up to donate money to Encyclopedia Dramatica? I love that site, as everyone should. BTW, why are there so many ads for prescription drugs in your guestbook?"

== Protest ==
ShutdownED.org and its vile wikisexual agenda is a threat to freedom of speech, so [http://www.ShutdownShutdownED.org/ ShutdownShutdownED.org] was created to protest this evil website, but was subsequently left to [[die alone|expire]]. No one bothered to create [[Shit nobody cares about|ShutdownShutdownShutdownED.org]].

== Identity ==
The creator of the site is too [[you|much of a pussy]] to even reveal his wikipedia username, so instead he spams wikipedia with a sockpuppet called [[Wikipedia:User:RIPLilo|RIPLilo]] then gets [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARIPLilo&diff=85635765&oldid=76178851 warned] by [[Ryulong]]. Even wikipedia doesn't agree with this dumbfucks ways.
