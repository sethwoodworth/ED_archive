[[File:Authonomy.gif|right]]
'''Authonomy''' is a website set up by [[Srs_bsns|major publisher Harper Collins]] in an effort to stem the tide of badly written Twilight [[fanfic]] that inundates their office. Aspiring authors register an account, upload their book, and begin "networking" in an attempt to push their book up into one of the five coveted slots on the Editor's Desk.

Harper Collins is either [[virgin | incredibly internet naive]] or a [[troll]]. They promised [[God | AN ACTUAL REAL LIVE EDITOR OMG!!!]] would read the first three chapters of the books maneuvered into the top five slots every month, thereby creating a juicy orchard ripe with [[drama]] and [[LULZ]] as the [[Twitard | stay-at-home Twimoms]] [[camwhore | update their avatars]] with new myspace angles five times a day in the hope that it will cause the few dudes that aren't [[fag]]s to accidentally click "back this book" while [[fap]]ping.

==How the system works==
*Each book has a ranking, its position in the line to get to the "Editor's Desk."
*Each user has a ranking as a "Talent Spotter" and a "Shelf" that can display a maximum of five books at a time.
*To improve a book's rank and propel it toward the desk, it must be "backed." This is accomplished by users putting the book on their shelf.
*A book's ranking is affected by the TSR (Talent Spotter Rank) of the user shelving it. * The lower the rank, the further ahead in line the book moves. The higher the TSR, the less valuable the backing.
*A user's TSR is determined by how far toward the desk the books on their shelf go. The books only help lower TSR while they are on the shelf.

====Terminology====
*Spam - messages sent via the on-site messaging system asking others to read your book, usually targeting new users and those with lower TSRs.
*Backing - putting a book on your shelf, helping to lower its rank
*Slut Backing - backing many books in the hope that some users will reciprocate and back your book
*Whore Backing - backing a book with the understanding yours will be backed in return
*Read - some users get squeamish openly asking for backings, they ask for reads instead
*Swap - "You 'read' my book, I'll 'read' yours." Same as whore backing. When someone asks for a swap, the appropriate response is ALWAYS "You go first."* Especially if you don't have a book.
*Making a book private - when the butthurt hide their books from public view because they can't stand the public humiliation any more.

====Working your TSR====
The best way to push your TSR down fast is to back recently uploaded books before other people get to them. Then as more people shelve them in an attempt to get in early and lower their TSR, your TSR goes down. Your TSR is only affected by a book's improvement while that book is on your shelf. 

To get the maximum benefit, pick something in the thousands with a green arrow that shows a lot of gain. (Authonomy nicely provides the amount of rank a book has gained or lost in the last week in parentheses next to the current rank.) You can locate these books by checking [http://authonomy.com/ListPeople.aspx?type=latest Latest Authors]. All the top TSRs circle this section like buzzards to grab whatever is coming in.

Keep an eye on what's on your shelf. If the arrow turns red, chuck it like a [[abortion | prom night dumpster baby]].

Having a low TSR makes you important and [[popular]]. Lots of people will pretend to be your friend because they want you to back their books.

==Drama==
Drama is the heart and soul of LOLthonomy. 

Harper Collins gave users the power to delete their posts, and whole threads, if they delete the first post, but in recognizing the havoc this can wreak on archiving internet drama, the rest of the posts remain in their database and can still be uncovered using the search function. They can't be retrieved in their entirety, but the preview portion is often enough to follow the [[lulz]]. This supports the Harper Collins as troll theory.

Another feature of the site is that there is no private messaging. There is a message system, but everything written is public. This often leads to accusations of [[stalking]] when one user carries a grudge against another and reads and comments on their messages. Users that have been around for a while confine their more savory gossip to [[facebook]] or [[email]].

Authonomy has very few actual trolls. So far it remains virtually untouched, a sheltered little drama orchard bursting with [[lulz | lolfruit]]. The users have thus far not experienced any real trolling, and have a tendency to misslabel [[attention whore]]s and [[butthurt]] users that return under new names as trolls.

Because this is the only "trolling" the site has experienced, they never consider an outside source and devote massive amounts of time and energy to trying to identify who's behind the new name.

Also contributing to the drama, many users post under their actual names or have attached them to their books, making it ridiculously easy to drop docs. They do this because they believe [[God | Publishers and Agents]] are [[Ceiling_Cat | watching their every move]] and that using their real names and pictures constitutes professionalism. No books have ever been published under pseudonyms.

=== Klazart ===
In March of 2009, an announcer for [[StarCraft]] matches named Klazart decided to put his novel Lesser Sins on Authonomy. He sparked a LOLLERCAUST and entered into the annals of Authonomy legend when he made a simple [[YouTube]] video asking his rabid [[gamer]] fanbase to please support his book.

<center><youtube>Nvm4eLUo6oI</youtube></center>

His fans then [[Zerg rush]]ed Authonomy, backing Klazart's book and causing a great [[BAW]] to be heard from all the users that had spent the past six months spamming the fuck out of each other and pretending to care about other people's shitty books in order to get their own poorly-written drivel to the [[Holy Grail]] of LOLthonomy: '''The Editor's Desk'''. 

[http://blog.nathanbransford.com/2009/03/authonomy-possibly-hilariously-hacked.html Agent Nathan Bransford's blog on the topic--the butthurt in the comments is palpable.]

[http://maxdunbar.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/if-anyone-is-still-taking-authonomy-seriously/ "This is the end of Authonomy as a serious writing site."] Butthurt plus racism equals lulz.

===A Faggot Rages===
After receiving a swift [[ban]] for attempting to [[delete fucking everything|remove all pertinent information]] from this article, someone going by the name Mike ('''gchordissweet@gmail.com''') proceeded to spam the holy fuck out of [[DYS]]'s email with all sorts of [[ITG|physical]] and [[lolsuit]] threats.  While it has not been 100% confirmed, it seems from the exchange that the person responsible for sending the emails is [[pedo|Michael Mitchell]].

<span class="co;BAWWW;Click here for the transcripts;0;Authonomy2;blue"></span>
<div class="Authonomy2"><pre>
(Note: Each "M" represents a separate email)

M:  Why won't you allow me to remove defamatory content from the authonomy page
D:  Perhaps you should lurk the site a bit to obtain a proper understanding of just what ED is all
    about.
M:  By stopping me from removing the content, you are taking part in the defamation and you can be
    held liable as well.   
D:  Please send all future emails on this matter to legal@encyclopediadramatica.com
M:  I hope you are aware that new legal precedent has been set in which internet companies (Google,
    Microsoft) must release information about their users who participate in defamation.  I will
    enjoy serving legal papers on Microsoft (who I believe owns "live") in order to obtain your 
    identity so that I can sue you.
M:  and just so you know, I am going to sue you directly
M:  you don't give a shit when people are defamed on the internet, but let's see how you like it 
    when you get a law suit coming out of your ass
M:  are you going to enjoy that?
M:  you want me to play by your rules after you won't play by mine 
    I hope you own property because once I get a judgment against you for defamation I'm going to
    collect my damages by taking away your property
M:  legal nightmare
M:  once your name is published in the decision, let's see what people say about you on the 
    internet?  you can't hide behind an anonymous identity forever
M:  do you know what you've gotten yourself into?
M:  does your family know about the behavior you engage in?
M:  do you think this is ever going to end?
M:  do you want me to show up at your house with legal papers?
M:  do you think it's smart to fuck with people's reputations
M:  what do you really know about life?
M:  I think this might be the thing you regret more than anything else in life
M:  something really bad's going to come of this
M:  I hope you're going to enjoy this as much as I'm going to enjoy defending my reputation to the
    full extent of my legal rights
M:  you've suddenly gone quiet?
M:  what? rules? go through your legal department? do you even acknowledge that the law exists?
M:  I guess you kind of feel powerful hiding this way, but I wonder how you're going to feel when
    your property is taken away to pay for the judgment i'm going to get against you punitive
    damages are going to result from your maliciousness. 
M:  you're a bit of a coward aren't you?
D:  I heard your name is Mike Mitchell and that you prefer your partners on the young side.
M:  i don't care what you say to me, but if it's published on your site and you remain a gate 
    keeper for it, then it's going to cost you a lot of money
M:  you know what's going to happen when you're found right? you're aware of all the legal 
    consequences?
M:  if you like saying those types of things, why don't you meet me in person and say it to my face?
M:  and you are aware that the more you make malicious statements like that "i heard your name is 
    Mike Mitchell and that you like younger women" the easier it will be for me to prove that you
    are acting out of malice, which will be punished with greater damages
M:  you don't want to meet me?
M:  are you concerned that a judge is going to look at your most recent email as evidence of malice?
M:  I highly recommend you show that most recent email you sent me to your legal department
M:  big mistake

=== The Great Authonomy Outage of April '10 ===


==Notable LOL-cows and Attention Whores==

===Absolution===
'''PROTIP: TAKE MANY SCREENSHOTS!!! THIS NIGGER BALEETS THE LULZ!!!'''

Absolution is a black person that thinks he can write. This is wrong, as all [[darkies]] are illiterate. He overcompensates by telling all the other basement dwellers how to write. His advice is always wrong. This is not because he is [[black]]. It is because he is [[ignorant]].

Some believe that Absolution is not, in fact, black, but that he claims to be a [[coon]] because there is a much lower standard for what is considered good writing. If a white man wrote that badly, he'd be sent back to the third grade.

* email: '''absolutionbook@googlemail.com'''
* [http://www.authonomy.com/Profile.aspx?userid=b0539181-4f4c-4ce0-83f4-1ef15ba24e57 Authonomy profile]
* [http://www.hardpressed-publishing.co.uk His Website]--Becuz if u pretend you got ur own publishing company, it's not '''SELF-publishing''' anymore, rite guys?

====I want to stab Absolution====
[[Last Thursday]], [[Arab | dune coon]] and [[wannabe|frustrated]] writer ShuabParvez cracked under [[stalking|constant harrassment]] from uppity [[ego | know-it-all]] Absolution and started a thread called "I want to stab Absolution" where he detailed how he would like to track down Absolution and stab him in front of his daughter as a result of Absolution dropping [[docs]] on ShuabParvez after Shuab claimed, "My company only employs black people to clean toilets."

{{quote|"Yes, that's right. Drive a knife deep inside his gut. Twist it deep inside his belly and watch the blood seep onto the floor."|ShuabParvez, on the sauce}}
 
ShuabParvez [[Alcoholic | drank moar]] and his plan became more elaborate, to stab Absolution while his daughter watched. Then to cut his throat and [[rape]] his daughter, then to [[faggot | rape]] Absolution while his daughter watched.

When ShuabParvez sobered up, he claimed he was just method acting one of the characters in his book and, sadly, [[baleeted]] the lulz before they could be adequetely preserved. He also quit Authonomy forever. This is unfortunate because, unlike Absolution, ShuabParvez could actually write interesting books that weren't all about how he hates [[whitey]]. This is believed to be why Absolution [[hate]]s ShuabParvez.

* [http://www.authonomy.com/Search.aspx?q=stab%20absolution&type=forums&genre=all&pg=1&complete=0 Outraged reaction can still be seen via the magic of search.]

====The Horse Poisoner====
For some reason that [[noone]] remembers because it happened [[at least 100 years ago]], Absolution decided he hated a member called Wagtail. (Stick with me, it's relevant.) He got his [[slut|girlfriend]] to dox Wagtail and succeeded in making her quit forever also, albeit with less lulzy outburts than ShuabParvez.

Because [[psycho|that's the kind of guy he is]], Absolution likes to remind everyone how [[leet]] his doxing skills are. But he's already been warned by Harper Collins for posting other users' info, so he has to be sneaky and pretend like he's making hypothetical example with her real info and totally not a veiled threat at all.

[[Image:Abs-horsepoisoner.png|LOL I WILL POISON YOUR HORSE]]

====I WILL DOX U ALL!!!====
In an uppity attempt to secure [[USI|his position as Lord of Authonomy]], Absolution decided to [[Internet tough guy|flex his e-muscles]] and show all the trolls just who is boss by threatening to [[dox]] them on his website.

The troll response ranged from [[lolwut]] to just plain [[lol]]. The traffic to his website increased by an order of magnitude as at least three people refreshed to see whether he had posted the docs of the users he imagines them to be.

[[Image:Abs-droppingdox.png]]

When he was met with derision, mockery, and requests for fried chicken, Absolution decided to tell everyone about his leet phonebook [[haxor]] skillz. Because that will show them.

[[Image:Abs-phonebookhaxor.png]]

'''After they stopped laughing, a decision was reached: The trolls then had no choice other than to promptly dox Absolution's girlfriend.'''

'''He proceeded to shit himself and has not been heard making ridiculous threats since.'''

He is, however, still making himself ridiculous.

====OSHIT UNDERCOVER NIGGER====

[[Image:Abs-undercover.png|Lock up your crack pipes.]]

Lock up your crackpipes, [[EDiot]]s. It's undercover nigger.

=== Amanda Leck ===
'''AMANDA LECK IS CURRENTLY POSTING AS:''' [http://www.authonomy.com/Profile.aspx?userid=ed21fab6-6ce0-4b32-8d7c-fcfcbfd7c8c9 Sugarpie] and [http://www.authonomy.com/Profile.aspx?userid=e39caebe-4c11-404f-86c2-60fe7f538dab Sweetiepie]. (Watch this section for updates.)

[[Image:SobX-helpfulcritique.png|Constructive criticism from Amanda Leck]]
[[Image:Sobriquetx1.png|thumb|right|Amanda Leck hides her double chin with the [[Fat Girl Angle Shot|MySpace Angle]]]]
[[Image:Sobriquetx2.png|thumb|right|Amanda Leck has terminal [[Internet Disease]]]]

'''Amanda Leck''' is a valuable member of the Authonomy community. She offers helpful advice to other aspiring writers on how they might improve their work (an example of which appears above). She is [[trigger|very concerned about]] the [[retard|mentally handicapped]]. Some might even call it a [[fetish]].

'''Amanda Leck''' is a shitty writer. She will never recognize this because she suffers from illusory superiority complex which causes her to believe she is smarter, sexier, and better than [[you]] in every way, despite being a used-up [[cam whore]]. She also posts repeatedly about her ex-boyfriends. The conservative estimate of the number of [[cock]]s that have traveled the well-worn path of '''Amanda Leck's''' vagina is [[over 9000]]. (John Booth fantasizes about someday being one of them.)

'''RIGHT NOW''' Amanda Leck is very busy [[delete fucking everything|editing all her old comments]] on Authonomy to remove her full name. She may also opt for the [[final solution]]. ED eagerly awaits further updates.
[[Image:Amandaemail.png|DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING. But leave your email.]]

==== Amanda Leck Sock Puppet Bonanza ====
A source within Authonomy tells us '''Amanda Leck''' is a <s>cheat</s> dedicated friend that uses [[sock puppet]]s to back her friends' books. In March she helped her friend '''Gunslinger''' keep his book [http://www.authonomy.com/ViewBook.aspx?bookid=11531 Every Atom Belonging] on the Editor's Desk. In April she is helping her friend '''Lorri's''' book [http://www.authonomy.com/ViewBook.aspx?bookid=15199 Euphoria]. She has also been helping her friend  '''Francesco Scannella''' boost his book [http://www.authonomy.com/ViewBook.aspx?bookid=12583 Sicilian Shadows], but sources say she will have to make more sock puppets if she wants to put it on the desk in May since all her existing [[sock puppet]]s have already backed it. 

If you're going to cheat, you probably shouldn't tell everyone. [[AMIRITE]]?

[[Image:AmandaCheats.png|LOL. She thinks she r smrt.]]


==== Sugarpie, Sweetiepie, and other stupid food-related names ====
'''Amanda Leck''' had pretty much everyone convinced that her new sock puppet Sugarpie was actually BarbAnne, despite the lack of [[CAPSLOCK]] and actually being ''much'' stupider than BarbAnne, even though BarbAnne is a [[coon]] and Amanda Leck is [[Pennsylvania]] [[white trash]].

PROTIP: '''Amanda Leck''' [[crazy | does not take rejection well]].

'''Amanda Leck''' gave herself away when, in [[BAW|a fit of butthurt lesbian rage]], she decided to vandalize this page. Unfortunately for '''Amanda Leck''', her [[angst]] and fury at Jo Ellis for not leaving her husband and kids and travelling [[over 9000]] miles to [[swingers|swing]] with Amanda was not particularly lulzy. After ED broke the news that '''Amanda Leck''' is the [[retard|genius]] behind SugarPie, she vandalized the page to remove the information and proceeded to make herself yet another sockpuppet and delete the posts where she fucks up and outs herself. [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Authonomy&diff=1998397792&oldid=1998397238 And then lies about it to ED.] (Fourth box under '''Line 298''' on the left.)

[[Image:AL-Jo.png|"Neither Sweetiepie nor Sugarpie have ever mentioned Jo Ellis."]]

Deleting shit doesn't unsay it, Amanda Leck. Also note the complicated paranoid belief that all posters are someone else (possibly [[reptilians]]?) out to get Amanda.

'''Amanda Leck''' is also fixated on the troll Snazzy because Snazzy is a black woman and Amanda Leck is horny for interracial [[lesbian]] loving. Or possibly because she believes Snazzy is the object of her unreturned affection. Snazzy can look forward to having [[stalker|many bunnies boiled in her honor]].

[[Image:AL-thosefools.png|HINT: It's the ongoing attempts at butthurt lesbian vandalism.]]

I have no idea why those fools who wrote the ED article would think that either. It definitely couldn't be related to the very subtle psychotic obsession with Jo Ellis displayed by all of '''Amanda Leck's''' various accounts.

[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Authonomy&oldid=1998394669#Fuck_You And no thank you '''Amanda Leck'''.] We are not going anywhere near your [[syphilis]] ridden [[cunt]].

Oh the [[lulz]], they do not stop. Note: it was previously called "Proclivity"; she may have changed the title again.

===Barb_Anne===
Barb Anne Smith is uppity [[negro]] with a constitutional inability to not unleash the motherfucking fury on every post that is not hers. Her excuse for why people do not like her book is [[racism]], when in fact it is because it is a shabbily written slave-[[rape]] fantasy with a plot stolen from Toni Morrison. 

Barb Anne exemplifies the exact reason that everybody hates black people. Possibly the whitest black woman on earth, she can barely spell and is in no danger of having her work published anytime <s>soon</s> ever. Her massive ego and sense of entitlement lead her to berate Harper Collins with demands about how they should run their site. She lords her "relationship" with Harper Collins over the rest of the forum, though inside emails leaked to an undercover ED source show the site moderators view her with as much disdain as everyone else. 

If seen in real life, she should be [[lynch]]ed on sight then hanged from a tree as a message to others to to be so fucking [[retard]]ed.

==How You Can Help==
Authonomy is full of [[drama]], starting around 5PM GMT (when all the [[England | Poms]] get home and start drinking) and going all night long. You can watch it closely for impending LULZ-splosion and take [[screenshot]]s because when the [[faggot]]s sober up they [[baleet]] the lulz.

There is a [[secret|seekrit]] [[facebook]] enclave. Infiltrate it and bring back [[lulz]] for all to share.

===Help them lern to rite gud===
One of the major facets of Authonomy is that it allows writers to leave comments on each other's books offering suggestions for improvement. Because of the popularity contest aspect of Authonomy, comments tend to stick to the "Awesome book! Backed!" category (with a little hint that the backer would like reciprocation--sometimes blatant, sometimes they just leave the name of their book). You can help them lern to rite gud by telling them the TRUTH about their books.

Also Authonomy has also most thoughtfully made it impossible for a user to delete comments left on their books. They have to report the comment and then Authonomy decides whether to delete it.

PROTIP: Take a look at [http://www.authonomy.com/Comments.aspx?pg=1&userid=8cb526d3-33cd-412f-89a3-9f19fe495345 Snazzy's comments] on the book <s>[http://www.authonomy.com/ViewBook.aspx?bookid=17057 End slavery]</s> '''BAAAAAAAAWLEETED'''  [http://www.authonomy.com/ViewBook.aspx?bookid=4862 The One True Bank]


These people think their books are ready for the big time:

Help them make sure! Because they are in the top five, they will have extra appreciation for your dedication to their success. '''DO NOT''' "back" them unless you really believe they are ready for publication. That only hurts them by feeding their delusions.
