'''Deleting''' is probably the second most practised activity [[OTI]] (the first being downloading [[p3rn]]) and an endless source of [[drama]] caused by [[butthurt]] or [[USI]], especially amongst [[bloggers]], [[YouTube]]rs, [[raids|raid victims]], [[underage bans]] and pedos expecting a visit from the [[Party Van]].

Examples include: 

*[[Deleting your LiveJournal]]
*[[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]]
*[[Delete System32]]

This emo cancer can usually be countered and foiled by such tools as [[data recovery]] applications, [[archive.org|the Wayback Machine]] and [[google cache]].

*[[Control, alt, delete]]
