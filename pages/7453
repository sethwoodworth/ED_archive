Sherri Shepherd
Sherri Shepherd is co-host on ABC's female debate forum ''The View,'' a TV show that continues to prove that women should not have the right to speak, let alone vote.  A notable black person and [[Christfag]], Shepherd became a target of [[lulz]] when she stated on-air that she was unsure whether the world is flat or round.

She looks like a fat version of the [[X_in_my_y|"centipedes in my vagina"]] woman.

== A Credit to Her Race ==

Shepherd became a minor internet phenomenon through her [[retarded|intelligent]] commentary on a number of [[shit nobody cares about|hot-button issues]] in a series of [[Jewtube]]s.  An obviously well-educated negress, she admitted, when asked by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] if the world is flat or round, that she was too busy feeding her kids fried chikkinz to have considered the question.  She gained a great deal of respect from the [[internets]] community by challenging the well-known [[liberal]] bias in the fields of science and history, by pointing out the obvious facts that [[evolution]] is a lie and that nothing predates [[Christians]].  She is the latest in a series of prominent nigger intellectuals, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Snoop Dogg, who prove that her kind deserve every bit of the 3/5s of a vote we give them.  40 acres and a mule, however, is pushing it.

Sherri challenges the commonly held notion that anything happened in history before the birth of Jeebus.

== Drama ==

Sherri's loevable antics attracted a host of adoring new internets [[troll|fans]], who flocked to her website like [[/b/tards]] to a [[mudkips]] convention.  These fans heaped their adoration upon her in her [http://sherrishepherd.com message board], offering [[racist|kind encouragement]].  Eventually, the warm and fuzzy feeling caused by all this loev became unbearable for Sherri, and she was forced to indefinitely suspend her message board.  She now asks her fans to write to her by snail mail only ([[srsly]]).  And much [[lulz]] were had by all.
