PUA
[[Image:Puagroup.jpg|thumb|right|I have an urgent business proposal for [[Rape|you]]]]
'''PUA'''s, or '''P'''erfectly '''U'''nquestionable '''A'''libi are a special breed of nerd that are beginning to take a foothold in the competitive market of [[Dying alone|studio apartment real estate]]. There are claims that PUA stands for '''Pickup Artist''', but the only thing these [[virgins|artists]] have ever picked up are beat-off blisters and a bag of Cheetos. In all actuality, Pickup Artistry is the great [[Guido]] scam perpetuated upon the sexually frustrated sector of the internet in order to farm more gold for hair gel and [[Old Spice]].

And people are falling for it.

Odds are, if you searched this article, you're probably what is called an '''AFC''', or '''Average Frustrated Chump'''. There are [[Weeaboo|many]] [[Goon|other]] [[Chris-chan|names]] for AFC but this is the official term. If you're [[nice guy|the kind of guy who values friendship and hugs over raucous callous fucks]], then you're an AFC. Using PUA methods, in theory, an AFC is supposed to become some kind of pussy magnet, but the end result is always the opposite: a pussy deflector with a better understanding of arithmetic and [[virgin|blue balls]].

There exists a few rules among PUAs, one of the chief rules being the 3 Second Rule. Once you see a fine young [[Whore|'''target''']], you have 3 seconds to '''sarge''' on that bitch and drop your favorite '''[[Copypasta|opener]]''' or '''[[Forced meme|neg]]''' before she puts up her '''bitch shield''' (or '''BS''') or the '''[[Internet tough guy|AMOG]]''' of her '''set''' interferes. Sometimes, her '''buying temperature''' might be too high to risk a '''LJBF''' in front of other potential '''sets''' so you should '''roll off''' at the first sign of an '''IOD''' or if she has an '''obstacle'''. However, if you are '''natural''' with '''DLP''' and she's displaying '''IOI''' after some '''[[Rape|Kino]]''', you should '''STMD''' and '''F close''' that bitch, fuck a damn '''[[Cybersex|@close]]''' those are for '''AFCs'''. Also, your [[fedora]] doesn't make you look like a faggot, that's a dopeass '''[[Attention Whore|peacock]]''' if I've ever seen one.

Don't forget your rubber, you fucking '''PUAM''' you.

== What's REALLY going on ==
[[Image:puafam.jpg|thumb|right|No sub-HB9s, jerkop]][[Image:pualegion.jpg|thumb|right|PUAs are [[Legion|Legion]]]]
Since [[Weeaboo|most people]] are utterly unable to hold a conversation with the opposite sex without mentioning Hideo Kojima's latest podcast or some funny anecdote they heard on [[IRC]], their chances at getting laid are [[Nothing|minute at best]]. So, they latch onto whatever tricks and methods they can get their hands on. As it just so happens, [[Guidos|an emerging new class of businessmen]] have been selling confidence to pasty basement dwellers for a while now. PUA lessons can be as little as 200-300 a pop, and usually entail a live '''Sarging''' session where you follow your [[Rapist|instructor]] and watch how he entrances the nubile young [[sluts|ladies]] with a mere offhand mention about how fake their shoes are. A common technique, the '''Neg''' or '''Negative Hit''' is literally an insult meant to put the unaware '''target''' on the defensive to prove herself to be worthy of your [[Fail|manly]] presence. If done right, the world is your pussy, or so say the [[Wop|masters]] of the game.

What they don't tell you is the part about personal <!-- THIS LINK INTENTIONALLY LEFT RED GET IT? --> [[hygiene]] <!-- DON'T DELETE IT FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK --> being important, being able to take a woman back to your place without having to trudge through empty bottles of Mountain Dew and boxes of Pocky, and most importantly: what to do should the [[Sex|unthinkable]] occur. No amount of awesome [[Bullshit|negs]] or smooth [[Rape|kino]] is going to get your dick wet if you're pushing 300lbs and smell like musty ass. Hit the gym, cut your hair, and maybe get out more. Who knows, you might actually be able to save a few hundred dollars if you learn to become socially acceptable.

== Example PUA Lexicon ==
[[Image:puas.jpg|thumb|right|Don't let the smooth talking fool you: he likes [[Scat|A2M]] and he collects [[Anime|wallscrolls]]]]
;3 Second Rule: Must approach a set within 3 seconds to avoid over-thinking, bailing, or risking the target seeing you stall creating a DLV. Men who wait before approaching appear weak, creepy.
;AMOG - Alpha Male Other Guy: May or may not be a BF of target, but asserts himself as leader of a group. He will try to break your game, usually with challenges to your material, but possibly may escalate to intimidation or violence. Usually an AFC, but some PUAs practice this.
;Anchor: Associating an emotion to a physical thing. To set an anchor, create a positive emotional state and provide a unique trigger. Later, use that trigger to recall that emotion.
;ASD - Anti-Slut Defense: Women's internal mechanism to make sure it doesn't appear to herself and others that she's too easily seduced. This is overcome with good gaming, extended comfort building, multiple location changes, and spending the appropriate amount of contact time in each stage. The PUA should also learn to handle women's tendency to backward rationalize any situation -- in other words, give her away to tell herself that her actions are not her fault.
;AA - Approach Anxiety: The fear of making cold first approaches on a group of women. Nearly every man has a fear of making the initial approach, based on years of contact and trying to make friends with rude, arrogant women. AA is reduced with lots of practice, and knowledge that you have a solid strategy. 
;AI - Approach Invitation: [[Asking for it|A women is signaling for you to approach her, with eye contact or body language.]]
;AFC - Average Frustrated Chump: The 'old style' of pickup up men by buying their time and attention with drinks, flowers, dinner, etc. The men generally have been taught failed social interaction at a young age by women (perhaps raised by women), and will cling for decades to the concept of 'just be yourself'. Often these men are angry and suicidal, and will cling for decades to their belief that women should be friends first and treated like entitled princesses.

==PUA 4 Dummies: Kids Edition==
[[Image:Littlepua.jpg|thumb|right||[[Chuggo|When I step in the playground throw your lunchbox to the sky.]]]]
It should be no surprise that kids are losing their virginity younger and younger, but when your 9 year old son writes a book about pickup techniques and your name isn't Mystery, you got a bona fide [[rapist]] in training on your hands.

Introducing Alec Grevin, Kindergarten Kino King. While he's actually in fourth grade, that won't stop him from laying his best negs on the unsuspecting nubile vixens at the jungle gym.

{{squote|Alec Greven, a fourth-grader at at Soaring Hawk Elementary School in Castle Rock, Colo., began writing the book "How to Talk to Girls" — about the dos and don'ts of dating — when he was 8 years old. The book came out of a school writing assignment, and he so impressed his teacher and principal that the book was sold for $3 at the school book fair and became the fair's top seller. The book eventually made its way into the hands of a publisher, and Alec has since been doling out advice to boys of all ages all over the country.|Todayshow.com}}

The article, [http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28038281/?GT1=43001 seen here], includes a small interview and excerpts from his book which include the following pearls of wisdom for all of the world's would-be Don Juan Degrassis:

{{squote|'''Q: What inspired you to write this book?'''

A: I saw boys around the playground having trouble getting girls — just not knowing what to say. I wanted to write a book that could help them.

...

'''Q: What's the most attractive quality about a girl?'''

A: I don't really know — just because they're girls.

'''Q: Are you dating anyone now?'''

A: No. Not yet, because I just haven't found the right girl yet.|Sage wisdom from a '''P'''ubescense '''U'''n'''A'''ttained.}}

A coloring book version of Alec's magnum opus was in the works, but was scrapped when it was discovered that most roofies are colorless. The scratch-and-sniff activity section was dropped for obvious reasons.
