==Mega64==
Self-described as, "Short films that recreate classic and current video games in real life," Mega64 can be more accurately described as a group of guys [[cosplay]]ing in public, rather than the traditional locale of comic book [[convention]]s.  While running around in public dressed as the [[Mario]] Bros. would usually register about a 7.5 on the [[Gay|Gay-O-Meter]], the [[IRL trolling]] that the Mega64 crew manages to pull off more than makes up for it.  Co-creator Derrick Acosta describes it as "[[Jackass]] with video games."

===Premise===
[[Image:Mega64 DVD 1.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of the first DVD]]
''In the not-too-distant future, the sinister scientist Dr. Poque creates a gaming console with the ability to tap into the human mind, somehow making the games appear real to its users. He "recruits" two specimens named Rocko and Derek to be enslaved in a hidden beta-testing camp for his device.''

''While Rocko and Derek are hooked to the device (called the Mega64), the viewer sees them acting as characters in the corresponding game, interacting with normal people in San Diego who are often unaware that they blah blah blah nobody gives a shit...''

The premise of the show is [[Shit nobody cares about|completely pointless]] and utterly [[retard]]ed, and only really functions as a means to give some sort of purpose to the team's various exploits.

===History===
The show was originally created by three guys named Rocco, Derek, and Shawn, and produced to start its life as a public access [[television]] show.  However, Mega64 [[Fail|never even made it that far]], forcing the creators to turn elsewhere with their idea.  After a pitch to [[G4]] failed, the Mega64 team was left with no other choice than the lowest form of [[media]] broadcast - the [[internet]].  Since then, the videos have gathered a [[cult]] following on the web, and two DVDs of the show have been released.  The DVDs are basically the same videos you can get on [[YouTube]] for free, but with a bunch of added filler and unnecessary characters/plotline faggotry.

===Creators===

The idea crawled out of the diseased minds of San Diego fucktards Rocco "Fatass" Botte, Derek "Douchebag" Accosta, and Shawn "Crybaby" Chatfield. These three faggots were later joined by Garrett "Fag" Hunter, a goth and confirmed homosexual. All four of the Mega 64 lack of creativity team are convinced that someone would think their shit is funny, and their forums have spawned a small number of fans who lack most basic brain function, and will honestly expend effort to defend their beloved Internet supertards. Despite this the creators all despise their fans.

===Podcast===

For some reason the Mega 64 members do a podcast which is absolutely unwatchable. In it they are self indulgent to the point that would make Quentin Tarantino shout "you can't fucking do that!" The podcast also reveals what inhuman douchebags the Mega 64 members really are, as they openly insult fans, reference internet "humor" that is neither funny nor interesting, and talk about shit no one gives a fuck about. The fact this podcast still averages more than 5 viewers is proof positive of the increasing level of retardation spanning the globe.

===Videos===
Below are some of the more popular [[Parody|parodies]] Mega64 has done.  More can be found on the [http://mega64.com/videos/ mega64 website] or on [http://www.youtube.com/mega64 The Mega64 YouTube channel]. If you find these videos at all amusing, it is symptomatic of a mental disorder of the gravest degree and should check into a mental institution immediately. If you get an honest laugh out of any of this, hang yourself, you fucking waste of resources you.

===Marcus' Corner===
In 2008, after the show had gotten somewhat popular, they decided to add in a segment called "Marcus' Corner," which is a [[Sockpuppet|puppet]] show where they interview people from the gaming industry and try to [[troll]] them.  It's relatively [[meh]] for the most part, but they had [[Dick Masterson]] on in the 4th episode, which is [[Pretty cool guy|pretty cool]].
