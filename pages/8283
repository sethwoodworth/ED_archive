''PIRACY, n.  Commerce without its folly-swaddles, just as God made it.''

''--Ambrose Bierce, "The Devil's Dictionary"''

'''The Pirate Bay''' (also known as The Pirate Gay and The Virus Bay) <s>was</s> is currently still the [[Internets|internet's]] largest source of illegal software through completely legal [[bittorrent]] tracking. Through the use of [[superior]] Internets and the "godlike" country of [[Sweden]], The Pirate Bay's efforts of spreading [[Photoshop]], movies, games and otherwise super expensive shit went largely unhindered, despite copious amounts of [http://thepiratebay.org/legal legal threats] from dumbass [[Americunts]].

The Pirate Bay was forged [[at least 100 years ago]] from the fighting spirit of free souls by [[Swedish]] gods, its servers forged from the metal of [[Cock|Thor's hammer]] and was stolen from Valhalla by the anti-copyright guild [http://www.piratbyran.org/ Piratbyrån]. After many generations, the guild Piratbyrån slowly died out and The Pirate Bay was left in the hands of one last individual.  However, this chosen one did not guide the pirates out of darkness and instead sold The Pirate Bay to [[Swedish]] gaming group, [[Nwo|Global Gaming Factory]].  The chosen one then moved to [[Israel]] to hang out with his fellow [[Jews]] and fuck his fortune in the ass while cutting coupons out of the newspaper.

== Legal Threats ==
Despite being in [[Sweden]] and completely out of American jurisdiction, dumbass [[Americunt]]s still believe that they can waggle their guns at The Pirate Bay and demand the removing of torrents. This is a common occurrence, and an entire section of The Pirate Bay has been devoted to it, bringing much [[lulz]].

A good example of this is [[WEB SHERIFF]].

[[The man]] once [[raid]]ed Pirate Bay's servers in an attempt to get back the [[MPAA]]'s [[Jew gold]]. However, it was back on the [[tubes]] the next day, and all that was found on the drives they lifted were [[over 9000]] naked pictures of [[Jimbo Wales]].

== Recent MediaDefender Drama ==
[http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070921/180540.shtml Reports recently surfaced] that The Pirate Bay is filing lawsuits against '''MediaDefender''' (of MiiVi infamy), a [[fail]] anti-piracy organization [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|hired by large media corporations]] (ie. Universal, Fox, etc.) to fight copyright infringement on their behalf.  MediaDefender's [http://torrentfreak.com/mediadefender-emails-leaked-070915/ recently leaked emails] '''('''torrent link[http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3806944/MediaDefender.Mail.200612.200709-MDD]''')''' as well as a [http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3809004/MediaDefender.Phonecall-MDD 25 minute phone call] to the New York State General Attorney following the leaks have afforded plenty of lulz amidst the burgeoning drama.  

==[[lolwut|Guilty?]]==
[[Image:SeedsOfLiberty.jpg|thumb|[[DO IT FAGGOT]]]]
On April 17, 2009, in a blinding flash of judicial stupidity, Swedish courts determined that the four founders of The Pirate Bay were "guilty of providing a conduit for others to break the law, rather than breaching copyright themselves". They were sentenced to a year in jail, and ordered to pay 3.56 million [[money|dong]] in damages. Since this broad definition of a "crime" applies to almost every fucking website in existence, the ruling is expected to be overturned in the very near future.

==Crooked Judge Is Crooked==
Shortly after the controversial verdict was issued, it was discovered that the presiding judge in the Pirate Bay case [http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10226167-93.html might have a conflict of interest big enough to drive a tank through]. Judge Thomas Norström, in addition to ruling in copyright cases, also just happens to be a member of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Swedish Copyright Association. He claims that he's a member of these groups [[bullshit|"to stay abreast of the legal issues surrounding copyright"]]. His status as a board member of one group, in which all three entertainment industry plaintiffs are members, seems to at least give [[orly|the appearance of impropriety]]. 

{{quote|Every time I take a case, I evaluate if I consider myself having a conflict of interest. In this case I didn't find to have one.|Judge Thomas Norström|the best judge money can buy}}

To add to the [[flame_wars|flames]], the defense has now [http://torrentfreak.com/another-scandal-surrounds-pirate-bay-judge-090515/ made allegations] that not only was the judge a little bit [[liar|biased]], but the courts, who are supposed to randomly choose judges, may have not been so random to [[rape|set up]] the pirate bay and take off with all their [[jew gold]] for [[RIAA]] and the [[MPAA]] and other [[Jews]].

Adding insult to injury, the aforementioned corrupt suckers of jew-cock have now [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/arts/music/13arts-APPEALISDENI_BRF.html?_r=2&ref=arts denied the appeal] of the defendants.

A court injunction filed [[last Thursday]] ordered Cyberbunker to unplug the site or face two years in prison or a $250,000 fine for each example of copyright infringement found on The Pirate Bay. The site went down May 17th, 2010 due to the injunction and was brought back to life via a Phoenix Down a day later. The main page of TPB feature(s/ed) a picture of a laughing kitten and the caption: "[[I Am In Your Base Killing Your D00ds|I'ms in your skynets, lollings aways ats yours futiles attempts ats contrllings our internets.]]" in response.

== Selling Out ==

On June 30, 2009 The Pirate Bay announced it had sold its soul to becoming legitimate like [[Napster]].  As everyone expects, this is a major blow to [[pedophiles]] across the globe who will now have to find a new site to browse with their dicks hanging out.
