MASSIVE DAMAGE

Probably one of the most overly-used and shortest lived [[meme]]s in video game forum history. The phrase came out of  E3 2006; this video-game producer Bill Rich showed this game [[Ninja|Genji]] at the [[Playstation 3]] press conference. He says the game is about [[Battletoads|battling]] and battling in AIN-SHUNT [[japan]] [[2007|real time]] [[Iraq|weapon]] change, [[Troll|attacking]], fighting, swording, [[LOL WUT|salashing]], and [[WTF|stapping]]. [[Teh]] guy said that it's all about "famous battles which [[Fact|ACTUALLY]] took place in Ancient Japan." Then he fights a "[[giant enemy crab]]" that actually existed in AIN-SHUT until they got extinct by [[hentai|tentacles]]. 

== Current Meme Status ==

At present, MASSIVE DAMAGE is a [[shitty|second-rate]] [[meme]] that is primarily used in video-game forums (i.e. [[Gamespot]]) as soon as anyone asks ''how do i get beat the boss'' they get [[at least 100]] replies telling them to "flip it over and hit the weak spot for massive damage". The [[sad]] fact is that this is basically [[true]] for most video games. The only time it was ever funny was at the time of the actual press conference. It should be okay to use this [[NEVAR|sparingly]]. 

You can also inflict MASSIVE DAMAGE on [[otherkin]], [[furfags]],[[trolls]], and anything else that isn't [[human]] to begin with. Destroying these will make you the [[lulz]] of the [[internetz]], even if you decide to go [[an hero]]! You will be honored because you did it [[for great justice]]. Go for it. NAO.

Note that almost all massive-damage [[pictures]] come from [[Wii]] [[fanboy]]s from [http://www.wii60.com Wii60.com].

== How Does It Work? ==

Weak points are usually in the middle of [[Some_Guy|some guy]], in the stomach or the back, or even eyes and head. Oh, and this isn't really innovative, every single other boss in every other single game has a weak point. Common  [[meme]] for when somebody gets attacked and or pictures show massive damage. You can see it on the internet. This technique can be used on cats and other animals, combo-chains and what not. .massive damage is also in that game VIVA PIÃ‘ATA by rare.

Sometimes even a sacrificial offering of [[McDonald's]] or some other junk food [[paraphenilia]] can be used to lure the [[succubus]] out from its [[Basement|dwelling]]. For the [[lulz]], ask a [[gamer]] who does [[roleplay]], such as that of the [[WoW]] or the [[D&D]] kind. I bet that they know where all the private spots are that will make you say, [[orly]] and then you go for it.  [[Neuter]] those evil [[bastard]]s and do it [[FTW]]! You know [[you]] can. Remember not to [[shit]] your pants, or you will be labeled as a [[/b/tard]], a [[shitard]], or even be suggested you wear a [[diaper]]. 

Shitting your pants will not only alleviate your bottom, but you will be condemned to [[furfaggotry]][[hell]]. [[Forever]].
