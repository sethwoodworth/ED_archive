Cracker is a word usually used to describe a racist white male or female who insist on using the word ''black person'' any chance they get. The cracker male is usually the most habitual offender, often using the word "nigger" from afar, but when right next to a large nigger male, usually keeps his mouth shut. The cracker female is a little different, as usually she enjoys the nigger cock like ice cream on a hot day, though she must usually keep it secret from her racist cracker family members or husbands.
