== Äm-irk ==
Äm-irk (an awkward [[Finland|Finnish]] pronunciation of the popular [[IRC]]-client [[mIRC]]) is a Finnish [[Internet drama]]-phenomenon, centered around the country's most active dramasite, the [[IRC-Gallery]]. It started with a 2-minute videoclip, of which there were numerous versions and formats circulating on the [[internets]]. The video surfaced in late August 2005, and was a considerable source of [[lulz]] for at least two weeks.

== The video ==
The video itself is only two minutes long (altough an uncut, hour-long version exists) and shows a group of [[16-year-old girl]]s invading a bachelor party held in a park in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. They proceed to advertise their [[IRC-Gallery]] profiles, express their concerns about the [[IRC-Gallery]] being used for chatting by people not using the [[IRC]] at all, and generally acting like [[16-year-old girl]]s, with a touch of [[Daddy's Money Lesbian]]ism.

The creators credited in the end of the video go by the internet nicknames of eetu and raxuli.

== [[Controversy]] ==

On the sixth of September, the video was taken down and replaced with text about people taking the joke too far. This could be because the girls made [[defamation]] charges. Considering the content of the video - especially the ending, in which the filmmaker's questions about spreading the video over the [[Internets]] are met with cheers - the idea of a lawsuit seems absurd, not to mention totally unpassable in court. But some idiots still shit themselves over [[E-lawyers]].

[http://www.irc-galleria.com The IRC-gallery] profiles of the people starring in the clip were viewed and commented to out of the sites graphs. There were also rumours of [[IRL]] [[harassment]] towards the girls and that they held an organized autograph signing.

== Analysis of the Video by Prof. TB Falsename==
[[Image:Swedishchef.jpg|thumb|A [[hott]] scene from the video]]
===Introduction===

The video opens with white-on black text that has been written by banging a human head up and down on a computer keyboard, preferably one belonging to the people in the video itself. Sample: "Vietetaan polttareita jah tehdaan". [[what]]

===Footage===

The footage opens with five girls in their mid teens. None are hot, and one of them has a forehead big enough to park a bus on. They sound like [[The sims|The Sims]]. One girl tells us their names: Meera, Murraj, Nooorna, Buurh and Po. She goes on to say: "Burple borple baarm maeetan beep pink ponk bloop burg."

This goes on for ''hours''. The girls amateurishly kiss one another in a way that still wouldn't be erotic even if they didn't look like they'd fallen face-first into a barrel of rocks and sandpaper.

They continue sprouting controversial phrases like "hoopolpa bloorta bling bling daddyfatsex", "argle bargle booli bali bomber murrspla moop." and  "Ma rakastan sua oon lesbo!". According to Maxis employees the last sentence means "I love you. I am lesbian girl!" in Sims language. Also, in the final scene in which Foreheado says to the camera "I have no boyfriend" the footage freezes and the word "ÄM-IRK" appears.

===Conclusion===

Fucked if I know. 

===Recommendation===

Release it straight to video under the title "[[Donnie Darko]] 2" and make millions off gullible students everywhere in the world (except for Sweden).
