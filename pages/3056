'''Frank  Garrett''' is an old construction worker for '''Duncan Construction''' who is oft annoyed by prank callers. He is known for his eloquent diction and brilliant linguistic skills.

== From humble beginnings==

Back in 2008 in the year of Our Lord Frank Garrett, a [[youtube]]r named [http://www.youtube.com/user/w3baholicx W3baholicx] made a seemingly [[typical]] soundboard prank (using [[goth|Deacon Frost]] from the movie [[Twilight|Blade]]) to a random Oklahoman construction company. What he uncovered was one of the most [[lulz]]y and [[oh exploitable|exploitable]] men the internet has ever known. The rest is history.

== A to Z Pawn Shop ==
[[At least 100 years ago]], pranksters called around Frank's hometown of Stilwell, Oklahoma trying to get him "in some shit" as his friend Tom would say. A call to a local pawn shop yielded a prank formula in which Frank becomes Officer Duncan and [[trolling|harrasses some criminals]].

[[Some argue|It should be noted]] that Frank believes Charles the pawn shop guy has been the one behind all the prank calls.
