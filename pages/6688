Punk is an <s>identity</s> lifestyle created by [[not gay|teenagers]] and the [[homeless]] hoping to change the world using only a guitar, [[your mom]], piercings and PATCHES. They mostly rally against the [[American|Jewnited Gays of Amerikkka]] by stealing make up and looking angry in the mall. Although they look like pretty cool guys, it's well known that punks cry too, on unwashed pillows with DIY needlework in mint green floss.

==DUDE THIS SHIT IS OLDSCHOOL==

Punk's origins are often disputed by the only people who care, [[retards]], so not surprisingly none of them can quite [[fucktard|make up their minds]]. [[Some argue]] that Punk began in the year of our Lord 1870 with the [[England|English]] band [[cock|Sex Pistols]]. Still others claim it was four glue sniffing New York [[hipsters]] with all the Stooges records  in a family called the Ramones. Whichever band started punk, neither of them is a winner.

After discovering that they couldn't play musical instruments, the Sex Pistols decided to form a band anyway to [[troll]] regular people like your parents, who still suck. They nearly became the ultimate troll, but fucked up by letting their cute bassist become [[an hero]] with the punkest drug of all, heroin! Despite this, fans buy their perfume and patches, and still actually listen to their album because they feel street smart when you hear it in their headphones on the bus.

The Ramones started when four [[retard]]s from New York  had buttsex for drug money and decided, in a [[pot]]-induced haze to attempt to make musical sounds. The spark that created punk rock can most likely be found when they discovered that they too could NOT play their instruments, yet despite this, proceeded to [[fail|try relentlessly for over twenty years]]. They sold a few dozen albums in the 70s before their members all died...[[HA! HA! Guy|Ha ha]]! Their music is now not [[cool]] enough to listen to, but buying their t-shirt from a major outlet store will give you instant street cred! 

It should be noted that punk died exactly last year. Nothing is punk anymore, including [[you fail it|you]]. That was the year your teacher bought a Green Day album and Mohawks came back in style with construction workers.

==How to BECOME PUNK==
*Dress Appropriately:
You need a denim vest with a Casualties patch, Converse or Doc Martin shoes, and a tub of punky color in your hair. The trashier your clothes in general, the better. Do not wear anything that is a brand that is not punk because that is [[selling out]] to the man, man
*Know your history. Refer to above. Anyone asks you about punk you tell them that. Keep your street cred, bucko
*BUY BUY BUY! Buy tickets to any show that is punk! Buy merchandise sold as punx rawk! Buy lots and lots of cheap domestic beer and cigarettes. Keep in mind that when you do your [[Gay|punk shopping sprees]], disregard the fact that the big punk rawk shows have corporate sponsors. That will only fuck up your message about STICKING IT TO THE MAN!
*Quit your job. If you have a job, give your boss the finger or fuck his daughter. If you don't have a job, quit looking and get on welfare you idiot.
*Travel in packs and use your teen angst to mask that you're actually a fucking pussy that is incapable of winning a fight.
*Remember, you're here to smash the state! Join a protest or play in a really shitty band. Challenge all people on their definition of reality.

==Life Cycle of a Punk==

[[Image:Jimmy_Urine_Farmingdale_03.JPG|thumb|left|Stage One: Poseur]]

[[Image:Orlandofoodnotbombsprotest.jpg|thumb|right|Stage Three: Enlightened Punk]]
[[Image:Yuppie-32829.jpg|thumb|right|Stage Four: Yuppie]]

* '''Poseur:''' You are a Poseur. You just found out about Blink 182 on MTV, or you may have just learned about a totally obscure band from the internet. You are too elite to hang out with your former [[NORP|non-Punk]] peers, yet too fresh to become part of the punk elite. 

The Poseur repeatedly speaks of their favorite Pop-Punk groups, Hot Topic, and current hair style. The Poseur will frequently misuse punk and thinks that sporting [[Straight edge|X's]] on their hands is a fashion statement not a social one. 

The Poseur attempts to emulate tr00 punx, so the only way to discriminate is to ask them questions about the bands they like. If all they know are a couple songs by the Casualties and Rancid, they're a Poseur. Placing the final nail in the Poseur's coffin, he dreams of attending Vans Warped Tour, despite the fact that the event is funded by a [[Wal-Mart|corporation]] which probably exploits [[China|sweatshop labor]]. 

[[Image:Socialist.jpg|thumb|left|Stage Two: Punk Rocker]]

* '''Punk Rocker:''' After floundering their way through [[shit nobody cares about|punk subculture]], the Poseur [[Pokemon|evolves into a Punk Rocker!!!]]. They begins to understand that government = evil and that either [[Anarchism]] or [[Socialism]] is the way of the future. This complex choice of political ideology is dependent on both personal preference and current employment (or [[homeless|lack thereof]]). The punk rocker is always pro equality and yet hates business men, posers, women, and your dad.

The Punk Rocker typically knows the local punk venues and a dozens shitty bands. The Punk Rocker [[Irony|preys on Poseurs, effectively imitating his then-oppressors]]. Understand the [[irony|importance of fashion in punk rock]], they may spend upwards of 10 minutes making their hair as ugly as possible and ensuring all patches are still sewn onto their jacket. 

This is also the time that a punk will either develop their alcoholism, start a shitty band, or both. When handing out change, do not give it to the punk rocker because he will spend it on booze and band shirts, and it will justify their belief in anarchy, possible deforming them in to a...

* '''Hardcore (homeless!) Punk:''' After discovering Adbusters, an overexposure to Anarchy, and hanging out with Crusties for at least one month, the Punk Rocker subscribes to the belief that [[Unrealistic Expectations|through collectivist action, peace can be achieved]], effectively achieving [[Idiot|Enlightenment]]. 

Enlightened Punks preach the teachings of [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and have fiery indignation towards [[Michael Moore|Michael Moore's]] and their favorite band's latest targets. If exposed to [[hippies]], the Enlightened Punk will insist that [[Bullshit|peaceful protest will change the world]]. If otherwise, [[party van|the police will frequently apprehend the Enlightened Punk for inciting riots.]]

Exposed to [[feminism]] by proxy, the Enlightened Punk insists that "[[BitingBeaver|womyn]]" would be better off dead than live under an evil, fascistic, patriarchal, imperialist government. In congruence to feminism, the Enlightened Punk becomes involved with the gay rights movement, believing that homosexuality is both [[goatse|exotic]] and [[bullshit|subversive]]. Additionally, in spite of the [[DAMN NIGGA]], the Enlightened ones insist on multicultural societies where [[Hal Turner|big bad whitie]] can never oppress people. 

Many eBay their leather jackets and turn [[vegan]] at this stage, still many others go homeless, but they still smoke because spending money to support corporations and taxes is fine if it's [[hypocrite|not convenient enough]] to quit doing so. At this point, they listen only to vinyl Anarcho-Punk/Crust Punk records, as [[Paranoid|digital technology represents barcoded corporate world domination]]).

* '''Yuppie:''' After becoming aware that the world will not [[Unrealistic Expectations|squat with him in protest towards multinational corporations]] and/or failing to abort at least one child, the Enlightened Punk decides to [[flounce|throw in the towel]] and put the college education that [[your mom|his parents]] paid for to use. 

At first, it will become increasingly difficult to find work, as squatting and actively seeking to destroy the government doesn't have reassuring effect on employers. When the Enlightened Punk finally does find work, he will evolve into the White-Collar [[Yuppie]], and the [[slave|paycheck rat race begins for him]]. 

The Yuppie will work for a [[Apple|big company that lets him listen to anti-corporate punk rock on his iPod]]. He will tone down his political ideology and subscribe to traditional [[liberal]] politics; demonstrating this transformation, his minivan (which his home owner's association allows) will be plastered with pro-Democrat and/or anti-W bumper stickers. The Yuppie reminisces fondly of the Ramones to maintain a [[NORP|public-friendly]], [[Politically correct|non-offensive]] [[lie|appearance]]. Desperate to ensure his children will not travel down the same path he did, the Yuppie will always attend the Pop-Punk concerts his children nagged him to go to. 
'''NOTE:''' The aforementioned will ONLY happen if the Enlightened Punk manages to find a job; if not, then he [[An hero|quits IRL]].

*'''Construction Workers'''
If the Enlightened Punk failed to obtain a diploma through their alcoholism and smashing of the state, they may become yet another general laborer. Many punks end the cycle of punk rock here, comfortably working in a dead end blue collar job until they end up on pension or workers compensation.

==The Genres==
Punk spawned numerous genres within the shitty subculture, creating a schism between the different fans.

===Oi! / Streetpunk===

Deciding that working in a factory sucked ass, working class men grouped together to form bands that incessantly bitched about [[lie|how hard their lives were]], and thus named their new created music called, Oi!, which is Cockney for [[O RLY?|Hello]]. When lyrics didn't cover their day-to-day routine, they sang about getting [[drunk]], being macho, etc. The genre turned ugly after a few fully [[fucktard|conscious]] Oi! fans listened to Hitler speeches, which resulted bands creating [[White nationalism|White Power Oi!]]. Lulz ensued when a few hypersensitive fucks got [[butthurt]] because drunk [[Nazis]] began attending their shows. From that, [[anti-troll|anti-racists]] had to fuck everything up by forming [[leftard]] groups such as [[Skinhead|SkinHeads Against Racial Prejudice]], Red/Anarchist SkinHeads, and other such [[faggotry]].

===Hardcore Punk===
[[Image:Hxcccc.jpg|thumb|Typical toughguy hardcore dancer.]]

[[Image:Harcoredancing.JPG|thumb|breakdown yo!!!11]]

[[Image:Earthcore.jpg|thumb|earthcore lol]]

{{Warning|Hardcore kids aren't intolerant, they only beat up rednecks or Nazis}}

Hardcore punk is shitty music. Its structure is quite simple so that no one needs to learn their instruments. Drummers  play two beats while the guitarists and bassists play awesome powerchords ad infinitum. The singer may choose to yell about STRAIGHTEDGE and fighting or [[lulz|walk around cutting himself and howling in to the microphone]]. Hardcore punk is a way for [[emos]] and other [[An_hero|failures at life]] to feel [[heavy metal|badass]] in tank-tops and jorts.

Breakdowns are a pivotal part of hardcore music. They occur when a song is slowed down, making only JUN JUN JUN-JUN noises, giving punx time to spin kick and prove how [[gay]] they are. When [[internet tough guy|some fat fuck in basketball shorts and an Emmure shirt]] jumps onto the stage and yells into the microphone [[rape|"FUCK. SHIT. UP!!!!!11"]] you know that band is fucking [[gay|amazing]].

Hardcore kids judge the quality of the music by the frequency, length and quality of breakdowns as opposed to the actual music itself. To [[fail|win at a breakdown]] you need to look like a [[retard|downs kid]] getting [[Don't taze me bro|tasered.]]

Mr. Bean gives us a perfect example of a breakdown.

===Anarcho-Punk===

OMG! Teh anarchy!!!!!1111one11

[[Image:Autofellatio 18.jpg‎|thumb|[[Rule 34]] applies to punks too.]]

[[Anarchy|Anarcho-Punk]] is music by musicians that actually believes in [[bullshit|Anarchism]]. Convinced they [[Unwarranted self-importance|invented Punk]] because of their [[bullshit|political views]], Anarchos are distinctively marked as the [[fucktards|most annoying subculture within Punk]]. Most of them adopt collectivist/communitarian views, thinking that [[lie|the world can be one big happy family]] if there was no [[Hitler|evil fascist government]] to enforce rules upon the [[sheeple|public]].

[[At least 100 years ago|Back in the 70's]], Crass, an [[United Kingdom|English]] [[shit band|Anarcho-Punk band]] decided that the civilized world had become too [[capitalism|rich]] by [[pwn|fucking over]] most of the [[Africa|third world]].  Convinced that [[bullshit|owning land is equivalent to owning slaves]], Crass took it upon themselves to squat in some shitty farm out in Essex and make even shittier music. 

Conveniently, Crass overlooked that living in the first world afforded them the luxury of squatting, rather than having to legitimately fend for themselves AND the third world governments would ''never'' allow them to spew their [[waaaambulance|discontents]] had they actually lived there. Tragically, their fans completely [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|disregarded]] their idols' [[liberal|hypocrisy]] and followed in their footsteps; thus, Anarcho-Punk was born, inspiring leagues of bands to fail epically.

Anarcho-Punk would eventually birth a child known as Crust Punk

====Crust Punk====

{{Warning|One whiff of a Crusty's stench will give you [[G.R.I.D.S.]]}}

Crust Punk is loud, abhorrent shit attempting to be both [[Heavy Metal|metal]] and punk. Their fans, known as Crusties, suffer from excessive [[unwarranted self-importance]] and are convinced they are [[serious business]]. Crust Punk lyrics are always about fighting fascism, yet they will go [[Batshit crazy|ape shit]] on anybody that that is somehow [[irony|less righteous than themselves]]. 

[[Image:CrustardHobos.JPG|thumb|right|Oh SHIT! These guys are REVOLUTION!!!!ONEONEONEONE!!!]]
[[Image:CrustyComic.gif|thumb|left|How to be a Crusty]]

As time progressed on into the 80's, a bunch of shitty bands thought it would be cool to fuse both heavy metal and Anarcho-Punk. Originally, this form of music was called Stenchcore, because when you squat for months without showering, you're going to fucking kill everyone around you with your awful stench. Supposedly, it was then called Crust from the title of some band called Hellbastard's demo, but that's a bunch of crap; it's really because the shit in their fingernails have crusted over.

[[Image:Crust-Punk-Couple.jpg|thumb|right|Aww, don't they look cute together?]]

If not suffering from unquenchable guilt from living in a first world country, Crusties are invariably haughty moralists determined to convert non-believers to [[Anarchism]]. They're best known [[Waaaambulance|whining]] about something like [[women's rights]], [[Nigra|minority rights]], [[Homosexuality|gay rights]], [[animal rights]], [[W|teh fascist United States government]], [[global warming]], [[white people|stupid white men]], and [[tl;dr|more stuff]].

Crusties preach at everyone that questions or opposes their [[bullshit|high moral misanthropy]]. Most of them are radical [[feminism|feminists]], going as far as to deliberately misspell "woman" using a "y" and [[BitingBeaver|refusing to shave their underarms and legs]]. Of note, most of them suffer from incurable levels of [[white guilt]], believing [[bullshit|all blacks to be oppressed by the man]].

Crusties are [[Vegetarian|vegetarian/vegan]], since they're too [[Fag|faggy]] to go out and hunt. Despite their sissified nature, this doesn't stop them from participating with the [[Animal Liberation Front|ALF]], wantonly destroying animal testing facilities that might come up with a cure to save ''their'' ass. Crusties are best known for [[Food Not Bombs]].

When not doing any of the above, they're usually [[homeless|squatting]], [[drunk|getting drunk]], shooting up [[heroin]], and [[Theft|stealing your shit for booze and drugs]].

===Pop-Punk===

Pop punk is bad music made exclusively for 14-17 year old year scene girls. It is more important that the singer of these bands be good looking than that any one play music or do something cool. Pop punk is notable for encouraging everyone to commit suicide.

===Riot Grrl!===

An ugly [[Feminism|Feminist]] by the name of Kathleen Hanna (moar liek Manna, amirite) was upset with punk's existence and merged [[lies|feminist politics]] with bad music and college rock, thus creating the Riot Grrl! movement. Unfortunately, [[Pussy-whipped|sissified]] "[[Faggots|men]]" actually rewarded the Riot Grrls with intellectual credence they never deserved. Little did these men realize that women don't suffer more, [[bawwwww|THEY JUST CRY LOUDER]]! 

Troll Riot Grrls by commenting on Bikini Kill video with "ok now get back in the kitchen." This produces many lulz and may even make an hero of one of these [[lesbian|single ladies]].

==Ways to Troll a Punk==

* Tell Anti-Racist Oi! Punks they look like Nazis.
* Tell them that [[My Chemical Romance]]/Blink-182/Simple Plan/Sum 41 are teh most hXc band evar! 
* Tell them that their brightly colored mohawks make them look gay.
* Mention that your favorite punk band is [[Shit|Green Day]]. bonus points if you say they're not mainstream.
* Say that Billy Joe Armstrong is a better guitarist than D.Boone
