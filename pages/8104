Text adventure
[[Image:Textadv.png|thumb|A text adventure which people have to love love otherwise they're [[stupid]].]]

A [[boring]] and [[unfunny]] videogame without graphics that was invented [[at least 100 years ago]], and so if you're [[Old school|oldsk00l]] you have to love it to the death and despise everything else. 

Oh, and you have to call it "Interactive Fiction" because only shallow, selfish, [[nazi]] [[catholic]] [[idiots]] call text adventures "text adventures" because they just don't get the joy of randomly being crushed by a sudden shower of huge stones in a forest.

Gamers of IF will usually run into [[flame wars]] with gamers of other genres, especially those of the action genre. The most prevalent insult used by them is 'dumb', referring to said gamers. Their main argument is that they, unlike gamers of other genres and sub-genres, don't have to rely on visual stimulation ([[Porn|yeah right]]).  

A [[MUD]] is a multiplayer text adventure, just like [[IRC]] is a multiplayer notepad. 

Beware! Some [[MUD]]s are full of [[furries]] who want to text into your pants!
