[[Image:Lioncashbanned.JPG|right|thumb|350px|[[Google]] believes that LionCash is a code word for [[CP]]. No, [[lolwut|seriously]].]]
[[File:Lioncash store poster medium.jpg|thumb|350px|Lioncash is accepted everywhere.]]

'''Operation LIONCASH''' was initiated [[Last Thursday]], the stated goal being for each participant to print lions on as many of his or her dollar bills as possible, until all money is converted to [[fail|lion money]], thus uniting the world by breaking down financial barriers with a single currency!

The possible economic and social ramifications of this currency conversion are as of yet unclear. Some believe that at most, members of [[ebaums]] will merely be unable to purchase their daily fix of [[piss|Mountain Dew™]] from their apartment vending machine, since vending machines won't [[I_go_chop_your_dollar|chop yo' lion dollar]]. 

However, there is the distinct possibility that the success of this operation may cause the utter [[anarchy|collapse of the United States Government]], as the panic stricken populace of America are forced to [[JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!|get in their cars in fear]].

Even so, the rewards are so great that Operation Lioncash must go ahead at all costs. Once the entire world is unified in the use of one simple universal currency - Lionmoney - the human race will suddenly be completely and forever changed.

This internationlawl endeavor both condones and encourages [[Muslims|Europeans]] and members of [[shit nobody cares about|other non-English speaking countries]] to turn their [[gay|vari-colored]] monies of [[MILF|Queens]] and [[Teenage_Kings_of_Werribee|Kings]] into [[epic win|Lion Cash]].

'''Unite the world today with Lioncash!'''

Updated: Although Operation: LIONCASH had fallen into severe depression, it was recently reinstated on Sunday, April 11th, 2010, so GET BACK TO MAKIN THOSE LIONCASH /B/ROTHERS!!!!!

==Legality of Lioncash==
[[Image:lionbenOK.jpg|thumb|Legally OK Lioncash]]
[[Image:lionbennotOK.jpg|thumb|Probably not OK]]
Creating Lioncash is not only easy and fun, '''it is 100% legal'''. According to the U.S. Bureau of Printing and Engraving: <blockquote> [w]hoever [[BME|mutilates]], [[Cutting|cuts]], disfigures, perforates, unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System, '''with intent to render such item(s) unfit to be reissued''', shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. [http://www.moneyfactory.gov/document.cfm/18/104 1] </blockquote>In other words, '''it is perfectly legal to write or draw anything you like on U.S. currency''' — even [[LOLDONGS|LOL DONGS]] or FUCK YOU GEORGE [[W]]. BUSH — so long as you're not trying to render the bill useless as currency.'''>:3'''

==UK law==
[[Image:Lion_cash_her_maj.jpg|thumb|left|Even gay British Monopoly money can be improved]]
[[Image:Charles_RARwin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Evolution|Charles RAWRwin]] invented lions [[at least 100]] years ago.]]
[[Image:Lioncash_retarded_q.jpg|thumb|left|Retards, every site has them.]]

Conversely, [[faggot|if you live in the UK]], this shit is technically illegal under some Doomsday Act of 1214, probably. There is [[Over 9000|a lot]] of anecdotal evidence on the [[Internets|internet]] stating that it is illegal to write on banknotes in the UK but it is difficult to track down any evidence. There appears to be nothing stating this fact on either the Bank of England or Royal Mint websites. [[Britchan]] did some investigation, and turned up the following:

[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0035/D.0035.193006120014.html The British Currency and Bank Notes Act, 1928], provides: — 
"If any person prints or stamps or by any like means impresses on any 
bank note any words, letters or figures, he shall, in respect of each 
offence, be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding 
one pound." 

"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reference_desk_archive/July_2004 Concerning notes], the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 says If any 
person prints, or stamps, or by any means impresses, on any bank note 
any words, letters or figures, he shall, in respect of each offence, 
be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding one pound. 
The penalty was changed to £25 in 1977 (Criminal Law Act, s.31) and to 
£200 in 1982 (Criminal Justice Act, s.46)."  

'''It therefore does appear to be illegal to write on banknotes in the UK, [[Nobody_cares|technically speaking]]. But since nobody cares and [[Pakis|shopkeepers]] write all over cash when they count it, do it anyway! Anonymous' team of dedicated lawyers will [[Lie|always be there to get you out of trouble]].'''

edit : It's okay, so long as you don't cover the queen's face. That means, do it on Darwin or face the wrath of the homoerotic British Bobby in one of Her Maj's very own [[party van]]s!

==Australian Law==
[[Image:AUSlioncash.jpg|thumb|right|They have lions in Australia too]]

An [http://www.rba.gov.au/CurrencyNotes/LegalFramework/representation.html Extract from Crimes (Currency) Act 1981] states that

"A person shall not, without the consent, in writing, of an authorised person, wilfully deface, disfigure, mutilate or destroy 	any coin or paper money that is lawfully current in Australia."

'''Fines include:'''
*(a) in the case of a person, not being a body corporate - $5,000 or imprisonment for 2 years, or both; or
*(b) in the case of a person, being a body corporate - $10,000.
Note: "Paper money" means money comprising a note written, printed or otherwise made on paper or '''any other material.'''

Of course, as with everything else, there are loopholes; one may claim that they are simply enhancing the currency for benevolent purposes, and hence is not violating the above legislation.

So go nuts, Ausfags.

==Euro lion cash==
[[Image:rawr.jpg|thumb|LOL, YOU P0WNED GERMANY!!!!!!!!!!!]]
The euro has no faces, however, lion-architecture will suffice. [[DO IT FAGGOT]].

==Indian Law==
[[Indians]] are [[BAWW|BAWWing]] over their currency being smudged. According to the [http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Finance/RBI_appeals_not_to_deface_currency_notes/articleshow/2922953.cms Economic Times], some [[fag]] said

"Currency notes are sign of sovereignty and by defacing them we show disrespect to it."

India's [[butthurt]] is duly noted, but unimportant. As it stands, defacing it is not illegal.
