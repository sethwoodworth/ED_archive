Epiphany
[[Image:Firefox-epiphany-comparison.png|thumb|This looks shopped. I can tell from some of the pixels and from seeing quite a few shops in my time. ]]

[http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/ '''Epiphany'''] is a [[browser|web browser]] developed by [[idiot|Marco Pesenti Gritti]]. Version 2.18.1.8.5.3.7.9.234.65.22.68.8.5.2.1.6.7.4.2.6 was released [[last Thursday]]. As seen in the image to the right, Epiphany is exactly the same as Firefox.

== Why it was created ==
When [[nerds]] realized that [[Firefox]] was becoming popular, and that people were actually using it, they decided that [[fags|true believers]] [[DO NOT WANT|did not want]]. Instead, they claim [[Firefox]] is [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|bloated and useless]] (which is true) and that [[Lie|Epiphany was the answer]]. It uses the same rendering engine as Firefox - Gecko - so it is exactly the same, just faster. It also copies every [[error|feature]] [[Firefox]] has. The name Epiphany is somewhat ironic, as it is re-creating the wheel, and as such, nothing was found or discovered. Except more people realized the developers were [[fags]].

== Who uses Epiphany? ==
Epiphany is used by nerds everywhere. It is only for [[Linux]], so only these [[nerds]] can use it, as no sane person would run [[Linux]], since it is crap. The nerds also added features such as not looking cool, to try and put people off it and keep out [[poser]]s.

== The Domino Theory ==
The Domino Theory is the theory that when one country falls to [[communism]], the rest will follow.  Epiphany is [[open source]], and everyone knows [[open source]] is secret code speak for [[communism]]. It has spread, under different names, to all operating systems. For [[Apple|OS X]] there is '[[Camino]]' and for [[Windows]] there is '[[K-Melon]]'. K-Melon caused much drama once people realized the name was completely [[retarded]].  Also, all [[KDE]] users thought that it was their [[browser]] (as all software that begins with a K must be KDE software), but then realized it was for Windows and went back to [[Konqueror]], which is a pile of crap the size of Kilimanjaro. This ruined the [[nerd]]'s plans to make a nerd-only [[browser]], and so they have gone back to [[Lynx]] and cry over their inability to look at [[gay|their favorite pronz]].

== Extensions ==
Epiphany, like [[Firefox]], allows for extensions. Extensions for Epiphany are different though, in the fact that none actually exist.
