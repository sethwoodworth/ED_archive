'''Phil Sandifer''' (sometimes known as '''Snowspinner''') is the quintessential nerdy computer guy who nobody would actually want to meet in person.

He is a Ph.D. student in [[English]], specializing in [[Webcomic]] Studies [[srsly]], at the University of [[Florida]] (Hey say hi to [[Miltopia]]!) He is also a managing editor of ''ImageTexT'', a [[Shit nobody cares about|peer-reviewed journal devoted to the study of comic strips]] and [[animu|animated cartoons]] [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/editorial_board.shtml].

==First Amendment fail==
In May 2006, some fuckwads from Wikipedia Review found a standard-issue "edgy" [[Internet killers|short story about a murder]] on his [http://pulpdecameron.livejournal.com/4282.html LiveJournal]. They [[stalk|tracked him down IRL]] and decided they had to report him to the police [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=1116 for the good of mankind], ignoring the giant FICTION labels all over his site. Afterwards he [http://pulpdecameron.livejournal.com/52175.html wrote about it in his Livejournal], and the IRL news coverage[http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/22/u-florida-cops-ask-f.html] [http://www.gainesville.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060523/LOCAL/205230326/1078/news] brought him a shit ton of new readers from boingboing.

In the aftermath, [[Everyking]] wrote this article because he was pissed at Phil for taking away all his Ashlee Simpson articles, and ended it with a totally profound quote from himself:
