==Quotes==
{{squote|The universe we perceive is in every way a holographic projection that is programmed and operated by information distributed in the aether, a diamond crystal lattice with the properties of a liquid crystal super-fluid. The aether is a sea of electromagnetic forces physicists properly model in terms of fluid dynamics. Indeed the information in the aether's electrical grid provides the reference energy longitudinal wave of information that is crossed at angles by other longitudinal waves making pixel points for our observation and experience of a 3-D environment (think holodeck on Star Trek). Our DNA is a holographic grating device as well (per Peter Mecer et al [CAYSE conference: DNA Wave Bio-computer]), The interference beam propagated by our DNA entangles with aether environment source information beams to cause our own 3-D manifestation within this 3-D universe, the interplay setting up conditions unique to each of us yet shared.|Colleen on the your existence}}

==Colleen and the Failien==

On November the 13th [[CassiusPlejarenAlien|Elliot Brown]] posted a video on his latest youtube channel to inform everyone that Colleen Thomas had died and promptly went around all the [[conspiracy|tin foil hat forums]] and posted as many threads as possible with the news. Of course the mods on those forums got rather pissed and spent several days removing as many of his threads as possible and applied the [[banhammer]] to the various accounts he had created. 

It obviously has not occured to Elliot that people who can uncover the most secret plans of the most secretive organisations on the planet will have no trouble tracking down his home address and phone number so that they can pay him a [[assassination|visit]]
