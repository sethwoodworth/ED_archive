'''Wikichan.net''' (previously '''Wikichan.org'''?) is a shitty [[weeaboo]] rip-off of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] that nobody reads, (except for the [[incest]] stories). Its content, which was all lost on the .org to .net switch, was basically incest stories, [[old meme|old memes]], incest stories, [[crap|"copy pasta"]], and did I mention incest stories? Other than that shit, [[MediaWiki|it was like ED]], but they didn't allow porn (except incest stories!) or anything funny because they had shitty hosting, that would later betray them.

The most likely reason for its founding was so the dumbasses at [[4chan]]'s [[b|/b/]] wouldn't have to make such a [[Pokemon|fantastic]] effort to find the [[old meme|tired old jokes]] they seem to love so much.

Apparently the writers of Wikichan have some [[Butthurt|kind of grudge]] against ED, just like the rest of the Internets. Also, every week the entire website [[9/11|falls apart]] because the owner doesn't know how to run a website at all. [[Last Thursday|As of this week]], the site was suspended for failure to fork over five dollars in hosting bills. They have since changed hosts, which is, naturally, almost twice as shitty; the site is <s>currently closed to editing.</s> NO U

==History==
There was '''etherchan.org''', then '''wikichan.org''', which both called themselves Wikichan.  At first, people hated and DDoS'd wikichan.org for copying etherchan. Then etherchan closed and people had to deal with wikichan.org which never backed up its database and lost the database every 2 months. Eventually wikichan.org closed and there's only some one site about the well cultured anonymous, some manners guide.

[[Shii]] had this good thing on his site where he gave specific, simple instructions on how to back up the database and said, "If only wikichan knew how to do this..." The ironic thing is that 1000s of people came out and nowhere and would just rebuild that database each time it crashed while these 1000s ignored other sites like lurkmoar wiki that have stayed up.

==Where did Wikichan go?==
*[[Nurse-kun]] and [[Copypasta/Archive_4#Blindmute_loli|Blindmute Loli]] have been rehosted at http://shii.org/knows/Wikichan. (or you could just check it out here)
*Much of the [[4chan]] crap is now at [[The LURKMORE wiki]]. ([[Common knowledge|Of course]] our 4chan documentation is much bettar)
*What remains of the [[pedophile]] incest stories are located solely on [[this website]], and require much effort to be re-found, [[Wikichan/A Collection Of Incest Confessions|such as clicking here]] .

==Fun Facts==
*Wikichan is a ripoff of [[ED]]. A crappy, unreadable one, at that.
*Wikichan urged us to put a stop to Tinkebell's evil because they are [[animal rights]] [[Closet furry|pussies]].
*[[Common knowledge|Wikichan does a shitty job of cataloging memes]].
*Wikichan knows [[Girlvinyl|Sherrod]] is a guy! OH NOES! SHERROD [[Transsexual|TUCK IT BACK]] AND [[Camwhore|SNAP PHOTOS QUICK]]!
*Wikichan knows that [[User:Blargh|Blargh]] is a sockpuppet of [[Blu Aardvark]] and that he has somehow sent viruses to Wikichan and has [[DDoS]]ed it

==Lol Vandalism==
Wikichan was very easy to vandalize because nobody actively monitored it.
