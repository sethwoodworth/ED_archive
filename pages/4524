== Favorable reviews ==
{{quote|Keith Boadwee is poignant. Keith Boadwee is fabulous and a bad-ass... Keith Boadwee is revolting. Keith Boadwee's work arouses me, and scares me; and makes me feel dirty and perverted... Keith Boadwee is a shit-kicker, a revolutionary, a shock-seeker. While his medium of photography could seem provincial, his application is raw, gutting, quasi-pornographic... (There, I finally said it.)|Christopher Stout}}

{{quote|He shamelessly, openly and fearlessly challenges the social constructions of gender identity- gay, straight and everything in-between.|Garth Amundson}}

{{quote|Which leads us to the best piece in the show "Untitled (piss in mouth)", which is quite simply Boadwee on his back, aiming a stream of urine into his own mouth. As a stunt it is full of self effacing narcissism, conflating Eros, humiliation, self sufficient grandiosity and an allusion to the spectacle that is the artist's way.|Jeff Jahn, Portland Art News & Reviews}}

== Best-known image ==
This, from the 1995 series '''Purple Squirt''', is the single most famous Keith Boadwee image:

== Cautionary or negative reviews ==
{{quote|The Compass to Campus, an event that brings approximately 1,000 5th graders onto Western Washington University’s campus, will be occurring during the Keith Boadwee exhibit. To completely prevent any 5th grader from viewing (accidentally or otherwise) the exhibit, we will close the gallery for the entirety of that day, October 27th.|Viking Union Gallery announcement}}

{{quote|I can't help speculating that there is a potential health hazard here (put simply - he is presenting the public with materials that have come out of his bottom).|Horace Dunn}}

{{quote|Wow, this sick fuck is in﻿ Portland? You might call this shit art, I call it exhibitionist fetishism. Fucker deserves to﻿ get shitcanned if he's actually allowed to teach.|anon4234}}

== Boadwee tells it ==
Apparently at an art exhibition, he holds a beer in his right hand, makes a gang sign with his left hand, and enunciates "R Kelly is in the house" in a singsong contralto. The camera then zooms in on the mouth of Boadwee's companion, emphasizing his amused approval. This video is only seven seconds long, and thus well worth your time.

== The phallic repertoire ==
Boadwee's ouvre is not limited to anally-oriented art. His [[cock|penile]] and [[ball|testicular]] images also have garnered critical acclaim.
