Viacom

'''Viacom''' AKA Viacum (pronounced "Vie-[[you|ya]]-[[cum|com]]" and is named for a Latin word meaning "kill your [[parents]]") is a media conglomerate created [[at least 100 years ago]] by CBS and [[Jews]] to put TV shows like [[All In The Family]] in syndication. Because [[leftards]] watched the show every week, Viacom got their money (and therefore power) and eventually bought out [[MTV]], Paramount Pictures, and even their creator, CBS. [[Last Thursday]], Viacom spun off their network TV stations and other boring shit into CBS Corporation, while Viacom itself kept the real moneymakers like cable TV and movies. Hahah, CBS got [[pwned]].

[[Liberal]]s who normally hate money-sucking big media love Viacom because they own Comedy Central and therefore ''[[The Daily Show]]''.

Sumner Murray Rothstein (aka Sumner Redstone, because he doesn't want you to know he's a Jew), head of Viacom, considers himself a "liberal [[Democrat]]", but in 2004 he said he supports [[George W Bush]] because “I vote what’s good for Viacom. I vote, today, Viacom.” This is either yet another example of classic big media hypocrisy, or it means Viacom just wants Bush so they'll have [[The Man|a big conservative establishment]] to bash on their teen-oriented channels.

In the end, Viacom is basically another hypocrite business, hiding behind the facade of being on the side of "the people" by catering to certain markets, particularly the [[teen]] [[angst]] one...but God forbid someone should want to pay tribute to their favorite [[shit]] Nicktoon with an AMV, or worse, post one of their old production logos for educational purposes on [[YouTube]]. (In fact, I am not exaggerating the fact that the latter seems to be considered worse than the former.)

== Complete list of stuff Viacom owned (or used to) ==
As well as the [[fandom]]s they are responsible for, those bastards.

'''CBS''' -
TV network with the huge fucking eye that looks like an [[ass|anus]]. Head news anchor was leftard [[Dan Rather]] until last year. [[Image:Janet jackson titty.jpg|thumb|Viacom-owned CBS appeals to the leftards during the rightard-aimed Superbowl.]]
See-B.S.? Boy, do we ever.
* ''All in the Family'' (now distributed by Sony)
* ''[[CSI]]''
* ''[[Cold Case]]''
* ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''
* ''[[America]]n [[Big Brother]]''
* ''[[old|The Price Is Right]]''

'''MTV networks''' -
Not just made of MTV, but also VH1 (which is supposed to be MTV for [[old people]], but thanks to their [[1980s]] obsession, it's main audience is [[emo]] [[teenager]]s who buy Care Bears T-shirts at [[Hot Topic]] and think they're really learning about the decade they were barely around for, if they ever were.), Nickelodeon (target audience: kids. Actual audience: [[pedophile]]s, [[stoner]]s, and [[fag]]s), Spike TV (Target audience: men. NO BITCH, YOU AIN'T WATCHING [[CSI]] RERUNS WITH ME! GET BACK IN THE KITCHEN AND MAKE ME DINNER!), Logo (the fag channel), CMT (the [[redneck]] channel), [[Comedy Central]] (like I said, audience is full of liberals and lots of other people who don't know what real comedy is), and TV Land (lame old-ass sitcom channel).

'''BET''' -
Television for [[nigra]]s.

'''Showtime Networks''' -
Y'know, it's kinda like HBO, except it's not. Yeah, just another buncha pay TV networks you gotta pay extra for just to see the boobs and swearing you can't see on basic cable. Don't bother shelling out all that money if you really wanna see shit like ''The L Word''. It'll be on DVD in about a week anyway.

'''Paramount Pictures''' -
Was once a proud maker of sophisticated classics such as ''Sunset Boulevard'' (1950) (although this has now been ruined thanks to the gay community thinking they can do a good impression of the old lady in the film). Latest release: ''[[Jackass]] Number Two''.

* ''School of Rock'' and ''Nacho Libre''
* [[John Travolta|''Grease'' and ''Saturday Night Fever'']]
* ''[[Ohio|Napoleon Dynamite]]''
* ''[[Star Trek]]''

'''[[Hal Turner]]'''


It was rumored for a while that they owned 50% of SEGA!, which would have made them also responsible for the [[furry]] faggotry of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' fandom, but it turned out to be just another case of [[Wikipedia]] being fucking liars again.
''Wait, [[Wikipedia]] always lies.''

==The V of Doom ==
Hey fucko! The main article is at [[Closing Logos Wiki]]!

[[image:Viacom.jpg|thumb|The big V(agina) of Doom]]

Back when the [[internets]] were just starting to get popular, a group of fat nerdy [[asperger's syndrome|aspies]] with no life [http://tv.groups.yahoo.com/group/closinglogogroup/ formed the Closing Logo Group] and discussed those little bits of production company animation at the end of TV shows that normal people don't care about. Many of these people remembered Viacom's old distribution logo in which a giant, purple cardboard V zooms up at the camera accompanied by a cheap, threatening synthesizer jingle. This, apparently, made the group members piss their pants as kids, so they called it the [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=viacom+v+of+doom&search=Search V of Doom]. Never mind that it doesn't look like a V; more like a [[vagina]], or a gay pride symbol, or a paper cup. Okay, maybe an evil paper cup. A vagina or gay pride symbol is probably more likely though since it turned all these people into fag pussies who videotape old, lame sitcoms to see if any old logos were kept on, and [http://www.closinglogos.com/page/Viacom scream and cry if they weren't].


Since the Closing Logo Group was created in 1999, the V of Doom has been spread around like a meme to people who weren't even alive when it was used (the 70s). Look on any TV nostalgia board, and you'll find this conversation:

Viacom seems to think that the '''bastards''' at Google planned for YouTube to have lots of crap [[amv|AMVs]] made from Viacom shows.  In fact, they said '''[[BAW|"fuck those motherfuckers"]]''' and [[lolsuit|sued]] Google for buying YouTube.  Google came right back with [[lol|failing to make a profit on YouTube, ever,]] thus proving that they didn't gain at all from Viacom's supposed loss.
