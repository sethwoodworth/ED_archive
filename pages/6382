Phil Shuman
{{ytid3}}

'''Phil Shuman''', last spotted [[Incontinent Student Bodies|baaaawing]] over how the [[internets]] ruined his Harry Potter book evening, opened last night (4/9/08) a new and potentially lulzy segment on [[Faux News|Fox11]].  He was to take and answer emails sent to the myfoxla site.  Anon was hastily gathered [[at least 100]] seconds before it aired and managed to send off some emails.

Due to his experience being a "[[faggot|pro lurker]]" who doesnt need to worry about Anon because he took [[Computer Science III]] and [[Buy a dog|has a dog]], he managed to identify and ruin some of the meme emails sent to him, however the fact he still read them off produced minor lulz.

In an odd twist of fate, [[Cheryl Shuman]], Phil's ex-wife, also has an article on [[ED]] for her own stupidity [[OTI|on the internet]].
