'''Wolverine''' is a [[Furry|superhero]] that appears in comic books published by [[Disney|Marvel Comics]]. Born James Howlett and commonly known as Logan, Wolverine possesses [[Fursona|animal-keen senses]] he uses to [[beastiality|fuck bears]], enhanced physical capabilities, a retracting boner, and a healing factor that allows him to recover from any injuries he sustained while fucking bears. This healing ability enabled the bear-fucker program [[Fchan|Weapon X]] to bond the near [[Dragonforce|indestructible metal]] alloy adamantium to his skeleton, claws and [[boner]]. 

Wolverine was typical of the many tough anti-authority/anti-heroes/anti-Jew that emerged in [[American_Idol|American popular culture]] after the [[Vietnam|Vietnam War]]; his willingness to use deadly force and his emo nature became standard characteristics for comic book anti-heroes, except for pussies like [[Batman]] and [[Superman]]. As a result, the character became the clear favorite for [[You|anyone who got picked on in school]] for reading comic books instead of [[stalker|chasing pussy.]]

Wolverine has been featured in a [[Over_9000|small number]] of solo comic serieses since 1988 and has been a central character in every X-Men adaptation, including animated television series, video games, and the live action 20th Century Fox X-Men film series, in which he is played by Hugh Jackman, [[YIFF!_The_Musical|who sings and dances on Broadway.]]

Sometime in the year 2000, Marvel Editor-In-Chief [[fat|Joe Quesada]] decided Wolverine needed to be a role model for kids so he had him stop smoking cigars.  But [[Headshot|brutally decapitating]] anyone who looks at him the wrong way is just fine.

In ''Wolverine #[[At least 100|125]]'', Wolverine called Sabertooth a [[Heeb|Kike]] even though Marvel is run by Jews who make him their flagship character, proving how badass of a highschool doodle during math class he is. Later after it's release Marvel [[DISREGARD THAT|recalled]] the issue due to the Protocols of [[Israel|Zion]], which say to confuse actual humans. The issue went on to become a legend and sky rocket in price, showing how much comicbook collectors hate Jews. Marvel tried to recapture the racsists hearts by having Wolverine appear in a barber shop and say [[blacks|spooks]] where there, but nobody got the joke because they weren't born in the year 1940.
==Trivia==
*In the comics, Wolverine is only 5 foot, 3 inches tall.  That's right, all he really is is just an angry midget.
*Despite being a trained and accomplished samurai, all he seems to be able to do is leap headfirst with his claws out.
*Currently, Wolverine is a regular character in six different series', all of which take place at the same time at different locations across the world.  Marvel explains how this works as
*In the newest X-Men cartoon, Wolverine is the leader of the X-Men.  This makes Cyclops, the usual leader, completely useless as opposed to being just mostly useless.
*His catchphrase is that he is "the best at what he does," even though he seems to lose every fight he gets in.
*Wolverine once had all the adamantium in his body removed by Magneto.  It was then revealed that Wolverine had bone claws all along, due to actually being a member of a part-wolf part-humAAAAAAGH WHO FUCKING CARES
