Ghettoditto comes from the word [[ghetto]] meaning cheap or crappy and [[frienditto]] meaning to steal the private hopes and dreams of millions of [[LiveJournal]] users. 

Due to the demise of [[frienditto]], ghettoditto has become the quick and dirty way of saving private [[LiveJournal]] entries or entries which may later be deleted or edited by the original poster.  This method can be used for any kind of webpage, not just journal entries. [[eBay]] auctions which may be pulled later, [[craigslist]] postings with inflammatory messages and all other means of web-based drama can be easily saved!

It is easy to ghettoditto. First, find a juicy post you would like to share with others, which may not last for eternity, or which they may not have access to due to [[friends lock]]. In your browser click 'File' and then 'Save Page As'. Name the new file anything you'd like, ex: '[[tawneelynne]]_freaks_out.html or [[mediacrat]]_internet_check.htm. Make sure to save type as 'Web Page Complete'. This will allow you to download all the images and formatting associated with it. If you have trouble getting the page to display properly (like with [[wiki]]s), [[Screencap]] and [[MS Paint]] can help preserve the lulz, for example [[:Image:Repossessedpokemon.jpg|this]].

Once you've saved your little masterpiece, you have the option of editing it to remove your login name. For [[LiveJournal]] you may have to remove it from several places. This is where [[frienditto]] was very handy because it would remove all traces of the person who was doing the [[friends]] betrayal. 

Then you'll need to upload the .html file and all associated files to a webhost. Of course we suggest [[dreamhost]] but there are plenty of others. Sign up for a [[geoshitties]] account if you are that scared of getting caught. Voila! You've betrayed a friends trust or saved an internet jewel from possible deletion, allowing all to enjoy it for generations to come.
