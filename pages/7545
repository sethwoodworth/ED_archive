Skank, or skanky is an adjective or noun referring to one who is undesirable for unacceptable behavior. Most often this behavior relates to [[drug]] use, sexual practices, and/or personal hygiene and style. It has come to refer to someone who is either or both physically repugnant for their filth and morally or socially repugnant for their behavior and demeanor, most often sexually. On a further note, most "skanks" truly believe they are irresistible (because of their numerous sexual partners), when in fact, they usually possess some mental or physical impairment.  [[Canadia]]ns are often associated with the term though in reference to a usually whoring person.
