Guile
{{warning|Guile is the only physically fit American in history.}}

Guile is probably the only cool character from one of the thousands of ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' games. The first time he appeared his background story was somewhat [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] but was later then turned into a patriotic [[Orgy|epic rivalry]] with the evil M. Bison.

== Tactics ==
Guile's most popular [[limit break]] is Sonic Boom. An attack that is somewhat supposed to resemble a fast blast of sound but looks more like a glowing boomerang traveling at half a mile an hour. As the game series grew this attack could be [[Spam|whore'd]] more and more, without comparison to [[Mugen]]'s faggotry.

== Additional Information ==
Guile also appeared in the massively shit real-time movie ''Street Fighter''. And was played by the worst person for the job, Jean Claude Van'Dumbshit. (You would think that getting an actual fucking American to play the part would've made it somewhat acceptable.)

*Guile dies in the end of the [[anime]] movie.
*Guile dies in the end of the real-time movie.
*Guile becomes [[an hero]] in the end of the games, even if you win.

== Additional Additional Information ==
McMerikans who grew horny with the one and only fit American decided to join DeviantART and submit fanpics making the character a [[Chris Benoit|'roid enraged]] patriotic pile of shit. Nerds have forced this character's popularity through the roof so hard that it has become a gigantic turd ready to be sent directly into Eurofag's air conditioners at the most inappropriate of times.

Finally, McMerikan haters decided to retaliate by making a Nemesis Guile on [[4chan]]. Which is most likely a failed [[Forced Meme]] created by Soviet Russians.
