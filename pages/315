=Who Exactly is Al Gore?=
[[Image:AlGore-PolarBearAffair.jpg|thumb]]

'''Al Gore''', or [[Cereal Guy]] is the Emperor of the his own country, [[Gorea]], inventor of the [[Internets]], circa 1992 and the inventor of the pokeball. He has ridden the mighty Moon Worm and slain the ferocious [[pedobear|manbearpig]] with extreme [[furry|fury]]. He ran for President of USA but lost to a [[W|Monkey]] over which he was seriously [[butthurt]] and grew a really creepy beard. It's rumored that Gore uses unnecessarily elongated words to compensate for his [[asian|incredibly small]] penis.

He is a very boring person. Sometimes, when he talks at people, they commit [[suicide]] because he's so boring, however, little do they know they are [[doing it wrong]]. [[Dying alone|He also has no friends because of this]], and because he constantly uses the word "cereal".

Al won an Oscar, an Emmy and a Nobel Peace Prize all in the same year, basically for being the guy who [[fail|lost]] to George Bush. After winning the Nobel Prize he spent the fucking night [[masturbation|wanking]]. This is because his wife, Tipper Whore, is a cyborg with a stainless steel vagina (clang clang).

[[Government|They]] have recently started marketing a new [[death|sleep aid]] in form of [[boring|video]] entitled [[Gay|"The Inconcievable Truth"]], featuring [[Douchebag|the man himself]]. This has been [[truth|proven]] [[rape|effective]] and [[lie|sales have gone up]].

How's that for a Fucking Inconvenient Truth  
[[Over 9000|"IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND!"]]

= Rise Of The Anti-Christ =


In [[ASCII]] code, "al gore" = 97 + 108 + 32 + 103 + 111 + 114 + 101 = 666, therefore Al Gore is the anti-Christ.

=Al's Initiatives=
=== Global Warming ===

Al Gore invented '''[[Global Warming]]''' [[over 9000]] years ago to kill off [[emo|emotards]] and Jews. He admits it in this quote: "During my service in the United StatesCongress, I took the initiative in creating the Global Warming." How he managed to do such a feat remains a mystery today; [[allege|some allege]] while standing on his porch in [[Tennessee]], he threw a lasso around the Sun and pulled it closer to Earth. Others say he was standing on the Sun and threw a lasso around the Earth and pulled it closer to him. The real explanation is lost to the sands of [[time]], unfortunately.

As Al began to [[troll's remorse|regret]] taking the initiative to create Global Warming, he decided to have a concert to raise Global Warming awareness called "Live Earth". It was held on 7/07/07, and 74,500 tons of carbon dioxide gas were produced by the event. Thanks Al.

Every time Al Gore testifies on Capitol Hill on global warming, mother nature sends a big snowstorm or hailstorm to welcome him.  This has happened so many times it has been nicknamed the "Gore Effect".  Mother nature enjoys making Al Gore look like an idiot because mother nature [[shit nobody cares about|does not care]] what Al Gore thinks the sea level should be.  When he speaks at MIT, mother nature doesn't need to do anything to make him look like an idiot since the science [[geek]]s there will just play a round of [[lulz|Buzzword Bingo]] at his expense. 

The former vice president's 20-room home and pool house devoured nearly 221, 000 kilowatt-hours in 2006, more than 20 times the national average of 10, 656 kilowatt-hours. This, of course, is why he wants you to conserve electricity. He wants it all for himself.

Al Gore increases global temperature 5 degrees every time he takes his shirt off. Mmmm....oh yes, and he flies around everywhere in his own private jet which contradicts his whole global warming scheme.

=== World Domination ===

# Create the Internets
# Invent Global Warming
# [[????]]
# PROFIT!!!

=Quotations=

* "1000101, [[lol]]."
* "[[BRB]] bio break."
* "[[How do I shot web]]?"
* "Ask not what [[Mudkipz]] can do for your country, ask what [[Mudkipz]] can do for you."

=Al Gore and Science=
Al Gore was awarded a Nobel Prize for making his power point presentation, "An Inconvenient [[Lie|Truth]]".  He used his "scientific background" to make this film.  Al has a Bachelor of the Arts degree in Government and he took a class on [[Computer Science III|climate science]] in college.  This puts his movie at about the same level as a Junior High science fair project. 

[[Shit Nobody Cares About|We need to save the planet. Carbon Dioxide is killing us. Polar bears are dying.]].

Al Gore claims that he is inventor of the the [[internet]]. Although it is also reported that the internet was born in 1970, via immaculate conception through Al Gore's gaping [[man-gina]]. This is a more likely scenario, as it is common knowledge that anyone can follow their land line to the their Isp trunk. Effectively, all trunks are linked up to a giant [[Belkin]] router located inside Al Gore's man-gina. The internet is a series of tubes, and goes where ever Al Gore roams. 

===Al Gore Knows Him Some Words===

[[Image:Gorehighfive.jpg|thumb|right|Gore gives himself a high five after winning first prize in the Miss World contest]]
[[Image:reverend lovejoy 2.jpg|thumb|Gore is a frequent guest on the [[Simpsons]] (although [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reverend_Timothy_Lovejoy&diff=115576577&oldid=114467550 "Scorpion0422" ignores this fact]).]]More quotes from the master of the internet and the environment.  These are all true. '''''[[PROTIP]]:''''' Bringing up any of these quotes to a Gore fanatic will yield the famous "taken out of context" argument so many assholes like to use when they're getting pwnd in an argument.  In short, Al Gore is a professional at pwning himself.  Smirk inwardly, for you have won at this point.
