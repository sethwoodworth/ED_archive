'''HellionExciter''' (Johnathan C. Myman) <strike>is</strike> was a crazy Jew famous for pwning himself due to [[unrealistic expectations]] of [[YouTube]]. Hellion's [[gimmick|game]] was basically as a wannabe [[YouTube]] "hater". He's currently [[butthurt]] over spilt milk; and basically no one gives a shit other than [[Tom Serson]]. Hellion also made claims that he was going to "buy out" [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] (but deleted <s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsCqdKAdhTU the claim]</s> later).  With exception to insane [[at least 100|number]] of [[sockpuppet]] accounts he continued to lurk under up until early 2008 as a result of his extreme butthurt about being trolled off of YouTube, [[noone]] has seen or heard from him in about a year. He's no doubt still lurking though. Rumors abound but the only real theory running around about his current whereabouts are that he was busted on [[coke]] charges sometime in 2008.

==Fun Facts==

==Tips to get your hair looking like HellionExciters==
Use about 1 - 3 pots of True Faggot Hair Gel depending on how long your hair is:
Apply to fingers and slick your hair back as much as you can.

[[Image:FaggotGel.png|center|Only $60 a pot]]

'''Warning: Continuous reapplication of True Faggot Hair Gel over several months can cause a mild outbreak of AIDS in some users. If you feel at any time that you may be developing AIDS, stop using the product and consult you doctor and/or your blog community for advice.'''

==A challenger appears==

[[Image:HellionExciterSmiling.jpg|thumb|right|NO! FUCKING PROSTITUTES IS NOT COOL! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?!]]

Some ten year old kid tried to troll HellionExciter, by copying HellionExciter. 

It turned out later that the video had been made by some grotesque 17 year old retard called [[CallumCartel|Callum Cartel]] who used little boys to [[personal army|fight]] his Internets battles for him.

==Censored Video, 6 April 2007==

[[Image:Masterb8hellion.jpg|thumb|right|[[HellionExciter]] often posts videos of himself Masturbating on '''YouTube'''.]]

HellionExciter's latest video, (titled "THE GREATEST video ever made on YouTube" and posted on 6 April 2007), which reportedly had a porn video playing on the television in the background, was deleted  for violating the TOS within 1 hour of it being posted on the site.

==Hellion Commits YouTubicide==

To celebrate the [[4th of July]] HellionExciter passed his channel over to [[Youtube_Nobodies#Tom_Serson|Tom Serson]] in the hope of generating some [[drama bomb|sparks]] to mark his [[flounce|leaving]] on a "vacation" from [[YouTube]]. Apparently Hellion had no idea that this would essentially mark the end of his YouTube days.  

Tom Serson posted a [[typical]] Serson video on the HellionExciter channel. YouTube made its typical response to a [[USI|Tom Serson video]] by [[ban|suspending]] the HellionExciter account.

==Hellion wigs out==
On August 8th, 2007, after he returned to [[YouTube]] under the {{youtube2|HellionExciter2|HellionExciter2}} account, he went [[insane|batshit]] and [[cuntpaste]]'d threats all over channels and video comments on [[YouTube]]. 

[[Image:Hellion_goes_batshit.JPG|thumb|right|Check into the psychward, John.]]

The sudden hostility was most likely caused by the recent intervention wherein his mother kindly requested that he un-fuck himself from his computer. Hellion, feeling very [[butthurt]] over his recent conflicts with [[YouTube]] users, continued to play the [[internet tough guy]] and additionally [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Hellion_leiks_to_blow.jpg threatened to blow up] people's houses. [[Image:Hellion_leiks_to_blow.jpg|thumb|center|oh noes Hellion will blow shit up!]]
After a 72 hour marathon of watching movies and snorting [[coke]], Hellion's [[internet tough guy|Rocky]]-complex began to [[Image:Hellion_2.jpg|thumb|right|...it's unsure what he "calculates"]] manifest itself again and he tried to goad {{youtube2|Mikeskehan|Mikeskehan}} into a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzAtYF8ZAkI boxing match in Las Vegas].   Hellion's previous attempts at organizing [[IRL]] events of these sorts with other [[YouTube]] users '''('''including [[Renetto]] and [[Casey Nunez]]''')''' had resulted in utter failure , yet Hellion continued to pursue his E-war with Mike despite having previously stated that he was leaving [[YouTube]] forever.   

==R.I.P. Hellion==
On August 16th, 2007, most likely as a result of sharing his [[YouTube]] channel jointly with [[Tom Serson]] again the {{youtube2|HellionExciter2|HellionExciter2}} was suspended.  As a prime example of the pathetic nature of the [[internet tough guy]], Hellion has achieved a level of [[Fail|Epic Fail]] rarely seen on the [[internets]] in his faggy e-battles.  <BR>
Hellion returned several more times with failed attempts to attack Mike and/or ED, ultimately closing his accounts on his own accord, most recently due to his discovery that his close friend [[Youtube Nobodies#RacerXWTFS|RacerXWTFX]] was a [[tranny]].  He headed to [[THE PROMISED LAND]] like most butthurt rejects on YouTube, but his account went dead shortly thereafter.  

Following his failures on the tubes, Hellion promptly returned to playing the guitar poorly, watching porn, and [[fail]]ing at life.

==CALL IN THE SOCKS!==
Since being banned Hellion has restricted his faggotry to anonymous [[sockpuppetry]] on the tubes.  The following is a top secret list of known Hellion Exciter accounts on [[YouTube]].  It's [[wiki]]fication is truly "mega lulz". 
<br />
''It's somewhat important to carefully note the '''names''' of the accounts.''
