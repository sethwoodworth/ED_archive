<center><big>The weather sucked balls, but that didn't stop us from spreading the lulz. The cops found our rickrolling very entertaining, but they declined on our offer of delicious cake. One amazing anon volunteered to translate a speech into '''American Sign Language''' for us (see the video below.) Also, we had our very first face to face encounter with a Scientologist; he was very good about friendly debating and no cameras or bull baiting were involved. After the party, we still had a lot of cake left, so a couple anons gave cake to the local soup kitchen. We want to definitely do that again in May.</big></center>

<center><big>30 Degrees and raining but Anon managed to create win out of the situation. After much debating Chicago Anon decided to move focus away from the pathetically fail scieno center on Lincoln Avenue to a more public location: Millennium Park. Anon staked out at key places in the park to engage the public, and got an excellent response despite some confusion from foreign tourists. Small groups of Anon also roamed the downtown area with free hugs and cards. Anon had no trouble with the Police or Park Security. There was much dancing and delicious cake.</big></center>

<br>Quoting SovietShark: "The protest went well overall.

At Mall of America the police were very nice and even questioning why we were protesting Scientology. I was frisked for weapons. I also had my photo taken by the woman with the K-9. The light rail ride to the event was fine.

At Starbucks we started the sign in sheet. We also started the police 'Thank You' card. Some cake was had and we waited. I announced some bs and we went.

Erra and Toad showed up late, but only because they didn't understand my simple instructions to get to MOA. We had some speakers, rumble, dent, weirdo, seven. Our sound system was killed when the Dakotas decided to pull the plug. It was going on for a couple hours though. We had our music and speeches. We had some chants, flyers were handed out, and passerbys were spoken to.

We cleaned up at the end, I announced the next protest was 5/10 and we all left.

The train ride back was fine as well. An old timer was telling me about his WW2 experiences, other wars and experiences thereafter. At the mall, as we were starting to climb the stairs about 12 mall cops followed us out. Sean said that he told them "we are leaving." As we entered the ramp where we were parked one of them asked "where are you parked?" and i just said "over here somewhere." We were left alone from there on out, but as I was pulling away I noticed they sent like 4 of them to search for us again.

Also, the sign in sheet says we had about 95 people."
