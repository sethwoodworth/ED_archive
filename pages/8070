Teens-4-christ
'''Teens-for-Christ.org''' is a perfect example of the existence of modern day [[fascism]]. Sociologists study this forum to gain light into the mind of leaders like [[Hitler]] and [[Stalin]]. You must sign up for an account with a "valid" reason, an appropriate user name, name, age, gender, how you found the site, and a yahoo, hotmail, or AOL email (they don't accept anything else). All of this is reviewed by the fascist admin [[pedophile|Bro. Randy]]. All threads are closed as soon as Bro. Randy answers you with [[bullshit|quotes from the Bible]]. Forum content includes "Lol Charles Derwin was teh crazee, if evultion is reel y ar ther monkies lol", "no holding hands until ur engaged", or a [[shit nobody cares about|lecture on scripture]] by Bro. Randy. 

Bannable offenses on T4C include (these are all for  real) using any [[Bible]] translation apart from the King James Version, thinking that Catholics are Christian, thinking that it is not a sin to watch a movie (any type of movie) or to listen to music which praises [[Jesus]] and proclaims to be [[God]] and the one and only way to Heaven because it happens to use an electric guitar.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, members of [[Christian forums|Christian Forums]] mock T4C daily for their limitless over-the-top assertions that even CF fundamentalist members can't seem to top. Near-limitless lulz are gained when T4C members attempt to [[Troll|spread their blight]] across any board on CF, being swiftly banhammered once deemed boring. In [[faggot|WoW]] terms, this means that T4C is basically to CF what the Scarlet Crusade is to the Alliance.


==Bro. Randy==

Assumed to be short for Brother Randy though it is not confirmed in any way. It is more likely that he is a [[pedophile]] out for kicks, because there are far more [[12 year old girls|12]]-[[16 year old girls]] registered and active on the board than there are [[man|males]] of any age. [[sick fuck|Creepy]] and [[pedophile|mysterious]], Bro. Randy shows up quoting the Bible and giving off [[shit|mangled translations and propaganda]] only the most [[retard]]ed human beings would believe.

He was voted "Fundie of the Year" in 2006 by [http://www.fstdt.com Fundies Say the Darndest Things], which he wears as a badge of honor in his [[attention whore|sig]] in an attempt to laugh at his own mockery. This, of course, hasn't stopped the FSTDT crowd from posting all his quotes for the sake of [[lulz]].

== Notable Quotes ==

{{Quote|My church recently visited the college, and many did not aprrove. They have very low dress standards. (Ex. Girls wear shorts to play volleyball in) I do not approve of that at all! I also don't agree with them competing with secular universities.|Bluegrass Girl}}

{{Quote|Wow. This really fires me up. If Christians do not take this next election serious, this is where we are headed. I know there are many Christians who think that Mr. McCain isn't the president we need. I agree, however I think we need to vote for <b>the best of the two evils.</b>|Bluegrass Girl "Best" as in the most evil?}}


{{Quote|If I were President the first thing that I would do is outlaw abortion. Secondly, I would promote the use of the death penalty.|Marksman}}

==Attacks==

[[Image:Bro randy.jpg|thumb|right|Bro. Randy, [[fatty|sexy]] beast.]]
Recent attacks on T4C by opposing [[atheist]] groups have caused Bro. Randy to shut down the site multiple times. One such attack involved replacing Bro. Randy's sig with [[goatse]], which resulted in epic [[lulz]] and much scarring of innocent religious teens' minds.
/i/ has also attempted raiding numerous times, most failing. Teens4christ's halo of ignorance was only penetrated once by a mighty army of [[GNAA|gay niggers]].
SomethingAwful has featured "Teens-4-Christ" in their "Weekend Web" segment in times past.
