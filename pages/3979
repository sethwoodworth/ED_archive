An '''imaginary girlfriend''' is a mystical girl who has [[titties]] and who lives in the [[internets]] [[tubes]] and every [[13 year old boy]]s wet dreams. 

==Imaginary Girlfriends==
Don't believe in [[Satan Claus]] and [[furries|Easter bunny]], believe in imaginary girlfriends who hold your hand and rub your cock. 90.01% of internet users who claim to have [[girlfriend]]s actually have imaginary girlfriends. 

Instead of searching for real girlfriends on google [[porn]], as other [[man|guys]] do, they masturbate while either looking at an [[attention whore]]'s [[MySpace]] or thinking about their [[significant other|friend's girlfriend]] and pretending she's their girlfriend. If someone tells you they have an imaginary girlfriend, they are horny and going through puberty, beyond repair, and most likely need [[e-psychiatry]]

It's also possible for [[women|girls]] to have imaginary boyfriends (but these women/girls are twilight fans so there's no hope for them any way). These imaginary boyfriends are often cartoon characters, [[Japanese]] band members, and other such. Instead of [[masturbation]], they fingerbang.
