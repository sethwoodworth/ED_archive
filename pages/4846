[[Image:Lifestyles-xtrapleasure.jpg|thumb|right|Lifestyles can be purchased for $17.99 for a pack of 24.]]

A '''lifestyle''' is the way a person, or group of people band together to make things like wearing [[fursuit]]s, listening to [[Shit bands|shit music]] and sticking your [[penis]] [[in the ass]]es of little boys seem like socially acceptable practices.

Should you ever decide that there is something wrong with a given lifestyle, or object to any aspect of it, this means you are bigoted and [[Godwin's Law|worse than Hitler]].

==Expert's tip==
"Lifestyle" is a suitable justification for any behavior. Use it to defend your habit of [[masturbation|masturbating]] in front of the windows at the library, or the thousands and thousands of dollars you've wasted on shoddy plastic figurines from [[Japan]].

== Great lifestyles ==
* Having an [[unlimited disposable income]].
* Getting lots of [[sex]].
* Posting to your [[LiveJournal]] (just kidding).
* Winning an [[internet lawsuit]].

== <s>Poor lifestyles</s> No such thing. Not-rich people don't ''have'' lifestyles. But anyway: ==
* [[Rachel Corrie]] - [[You fail it|failed]] to remove herself from the path of a deadly bulldozer
* [[Richard Stallman]] - synonymous with "unsanitary"

== Not a Lifestyle ==
* [[Furry]]. No.
