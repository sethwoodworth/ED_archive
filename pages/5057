The choice [[IRC]] client for nearly all [[faggots|Windows users]], '''mIRC''' was invented in 1995 by famous [[Palestinian]] Khaled Mardam-Bey. It has since then been used to provide [[lulz]] and [[warez]] for generations of [[chat]]ters all over the world.

==Key Features==
[[Image:MIRC HUEG.png|thumb|[[Xbox]]-sized [[German]] mIRC, with a small font. Do this and your eyes will [[H8|love]] you.]]

* You can connect to IRC[[oneoneone|!!!1]]
* If you're on a channel and type text, other people on the channel can read it. When used correctly, this method is [[some argue|widely acclaimed]] as being a major source of lulz on the [[internets]].
* When you're on a channel and someone types text, you can read it. Used together with the previous method, this boosts the lulz factor well [[over 9000]].
* Recently-added UTF-8 support. This pisses off [[basement dwellers|linux nerds]] to no end, as they no longer can claim to pwn you with their ability to type [[Tibet]]an characters.
* Unrestricted shareware. In a smart move to further piss off [[Linux]] [[nerds]], the creator of mIRC has given [[you]] the possibility to [[troll]] people ''without saying a word''. Join a channel of [[GPL]] advocates, wait for the [[y halo thar|/CTCP VERSION]] requests, and enjoy.
* Send [[CP|filez]] to [[pedos|pplz]]!
* Understandable interface. This also pisses off the [[Linux]] crowd, but they hate to admit it.
* Was (probably) not made by [[Jews]].

== Noticeable Shortcomings ==
[[Image:MIRC xdcc.png|thumb|Lack of gay.pl doesn't stop people from making the display as gay as possible.]]

* Doesn't support [[gay.pl]]. However, the (file) closet is full of mIRC scripts that have annoying colors ''and'' let you play with [[skript kiddie|nuke options]]. Be proud of your allegedly [[heterosexual]] self! Get violent if someone questions you!
* Can't run with only a command-line interface, but those are for nerds anyway.
* Lacks [[boobs]], and will consistently refuse to [[your mom|perform fellatio]] no matter how [[l33t|good]] your [[script]]ing skills are. Despite this, for many people mIRC is the [[cybersex|closest]] they'll ever get to having a [[girlfriend]].
* Using mIRC helps international [[terrorism]].
* Lacking native support for the late [[1990s]] phenomenon, AOLSAY
