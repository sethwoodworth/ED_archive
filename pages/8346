The colonization of America
=[[EPIC WIN]]=
[[Last Thursday|Some time ago]] the Benevolent Columbus stumbled upon a backwater continent while searching for [[Jenkem|spice]]. When word got back to Europe that there were poor natives living in a faraway land the Europeans selflessly took it upon their shoulders to help spread [[disease|peace]], [[hookers and blow|happiness]], and [[Christianity]] to the primitives, thoroughly succeeding. The Indians had too much gold, so the [[white|civilized countries]] helped them out by taking some of that useless gold off their hands. The Indians were forever grateful for the assistance they received, and now enjoy a booming casino business as well as cheap cigarettes.

Even though [[at least 100]] million Indians have been killed since [[Columbus]] took his boat to [[India]], this wasn't an act of terror because terrorism was invented [[9/11|9]] years ago. [[Freedom]] — the word and everything, though — was invented (and [[©]], [[®]], [[™]], [[patent]]ed — too) at that time.

Second only to [[Australia]] and [[New_Zealand|Sheepfucktardland]] the [[Murka|Amer]][[Brazil|icas]] was the latest continent to be [[rape|incorporated]] into the [[Internet|Global Network]] of [[BDSM|Human Relations]]. This achievement allowed for higher peaks of Human Civizilation, like [[Cigarettes]], [[Chocolate]], and plenty of [[loli]] with the only downside of syphilis - a very small price to pay for so much win. It is to be noted that the Native Americans benefited just as much getting to know the delights of [[alcohol]] and [[freedom]] for the first time in their pathetic history. Experts note that had Europeans never contacted the Injuns they would have continued fighting each other senselessly to their own extinction, however now their numbers, though mixed with better genes, grow exponentially thanks to [[White|Caucasian]] inventions such as [[Drugs|Pharmaceutical]]s.
