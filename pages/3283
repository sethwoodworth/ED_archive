'''Genital Herpes''' (technically herpes simplex, but more commonly known simply as [[Ron Mexico|"herpes"]]) is a [[Virus#First definition|virus that effects humans]] and one of [[God]]'s gift to [[teh]] [[lulz]]. It won't kill you, but once it infects you, it's like a [[tattoo]]: permanent.

Although a permanent STD, according to advertisements for herpes [[Drug|medication]] Valtrex, herpes will cause [[you]] [[Bullshit|to live a more glamorous life]]: [[Mr. Hands|riding horseback]] through the ocean shores of California, [[Cum|white-water]] rafting in the Colorado River, riding a motorcycle through the chilly evening desert plains, and climbing the rugged terrain of the Appalachian Mountains. 

In fact, you get genital herpes because you are a [[whore]]. Feel free to treat those with genital herpes like the [[smegma]]-sucking, [[santorum]]-licking, low-life shits that they are.

1-in-4 [[Americans]] over age 12 have "teh herp". While not [[Goatse|shocking]] at first, the number can be viewed as a [[Drunk|staggering]] [[Statistics|statistic]] if applied in the following manner: Imagine, if you will, going to see your local [[baseball]] team and the stadium is at near capacity. [[Over 9000|10,000]] of your fellow beer swilling, [[Fellatio|hot dog eating]] [[Incest|brethren]] are herpetic. [[No|Feel better now?]]

== Known to be infected ==	 
*[[Pencilleadproductions]] - It's [[fuckwit]]s like James who hear "I have herpes, but you won't get it cuz, like, that doesn't happen" and all they can think is "I'm gonna fuck you without a condom, then brag about it on [[IRC]]". Then six days later, when they get a cold sore, they deny having teh herpes...Do you wanna be a James?	 

[[Image:Look_on_your_face_imediately_after_you_get_herpes_from_some_cunt.jpg|thumb|"Yes I hit that" - James. And she told him she had herpes...]]	 

[[Image:With_an_ass_like_that,_it's_gotta_be_herpes.jpg|frame|Note the red herpes sores. Would you hit this without a condom? [[You|James]] did...]]	 

== What to do if you have herpes ==
The proper treatment for genital herpes is with bacteriostatics and antivirals, such as acyclovir. Acyclovir should be taken orally in 200 mg doses five times per day (for a total of 1 g daily) for 10 days.
Oh, what's that? [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|Your stupid health care system doesn't provide you with prescription coverage]]? No problem: you can always practice the tried-and-true method of just not telling people that you have herpes because, hey, you're not contagious if you don't have active sores, right?

== Celebs with "Da Herp" ==
