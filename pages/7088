'''Rove McManus''' a.k.a. Rove McmANUS, is an [[Australia]]n [[IRL troll]] and [[Homosexual]] famous for deliberately marrying a dying [[cancer]] patient to fool the public into believing he's a [[breeder]].

==The Lies==
For [[at least 100]] years Rove has [[terrorism|terrorised]] the [[Australia]]n [[television]] industry with his [[unfunny]] [[IRL meme]]s and terrible Jokes. On the most part this was accepted by the public until November 11 2006 when his wife Belinda Emmett died of [[cancer]]. It was soon spread throughout the media that he had always known she had the illness and it was soon blatantly obvious that he had married her to hide his flamboyant sexuality.

==The Proof==
*[[Breeder]]s don't like [[Fag]]s, Rove needed appear straight, Belinda = the perfect victim.
*[[Breeder]]s love [[boobs]], Belinda Emmett had breast cancer, ergo, Rove is [[gay]].
*His wife was to sick to have [[sex]] with him, ergo, Rove is [[gay]].
*Rove was born in Cocklebiddy in Western Australia. If you carefully examine the town of his birth you will notice the word [[cock]] which is a term for [[Penis]]. Gay men have penises. They stick them in each others poopers, ergo, Rove is [[gay]]

==Rove Killed Belinda==
All the carefully orchestrated media attention gained by the joyful event of his wife's death gave Rove  millions of pity points with the public. This is perfect timing as 2006 was the first time in years that he didn't win the gold logie. It is guaranteed that his [[TV]] rating will [[drama]]tically rise next year thus making him [[God]] of [[Australia]] again. It is highly probable that Rove ''pulled the cord'' on Belinda just to benefit his career. 

Rove is a [[murder]]er and the truth must be told. It is blatantly obvious that he killed both his wife and [[Steve Irwin]], the [[police]] need to immediately arrest this [[evil]] [[faggot]] son of a bitch before he kills us all.

==The Final Blasphemy==
Immediately after Belinda's death Rove released a song by his [[dead]] wife titled "[http://rovingmedia.net/be/Belle_LTP_Mast.mp3 Less than perfect]" on his internets site. The message of this song is that she was not perfect for Rove due to not having a [[penis]]. This earned him a [[shitload]] of money six months later when he released it as an [[IRL]] single and it hit the Australian top 10 and [[rape]]d the pockets of innocent [[idiot]]s everywhere.

==Internets replies to this Article==
''Well I am all for humour..but anything that makes the majority of its readers pull back in disgust is just poor taste and the people who made that, plus anyone who finds that funny, must have serious issues in their own lives. For a start..its way too soon, plus there is never anything funny about making fun of the dead, or their grieving family...no matter who it is.'' - ch1-1 on [[IMDb]]

==Meme machine==
As one of Australia's most prominent retards everything Rove says is immediately lapped up into the their vocabulary like [[santorum]] in a bath house. These retarded sayings have of course spread their legs wide open and [[cum|came]] all over these fine internets tubes becoming [[meme]]s both [[IRL]] and on the [[tubes]].
*'''What the?''' - Not initially created by Rove but popularized by him, What the? was a segment where people would send in stupid shit/pictures of it many of said pictures would be spread widely around the internets. +"What the"+"Rove" generates [http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=%2B%22what+the%22%2B%22rove%22&btnG=Search&meta= 1.25 million hits on the Google].
*'''Say hi to your mum for me''' - Roves goodbye phrase and special little way of expressing his wish to do [[your mother]] and perpetrate the huge lie that is his [[breeder]]hood. Typing say hi to your mum for me in [[the Google]] generates [http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=Say+hi+to+your+mum+for+me&btnG=Search&meta= 1.4 million hits].
*'''A little bit of wee came out''' - Said every time Rove becomes excited, this phrase is clearly purported to cover up the fact that he just [[cum|came]]. Entering A little bit of wee came out into the Googles search bar will get you [http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=A+little+bit+of+wee+came+out&btnG=Search&meta= 1.4 million results].
