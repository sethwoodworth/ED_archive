[[Image:Lolnerds.jpg |right|thumb|What most campaigns will degenerate into.]]

''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' is a cover story used by [[nerd]]s to explain why they gather in someone's unfinished basement on Saturday nights for long sessions of [[masturbation|rolling dice]] and [[bondage|role playing]] [[gay|scantily-clad Valkyries]]. 

To an outsider, D&D can be considered the plague upon society that motivates [[Basement Dwellers|Basement Dwellers]], [[You|fuglies]], and [[nerd|nerds]] to leave their houses and congregate in a huge orgy of fail. It is hypothesized that without shitty games like D&D, nerds would further isolate themselves into their basements and eventually die from hunger(unable to walk to the local convenience store). 

''Dungeons & Dragons'' was created sometime in the mid 1970's by a nerd named Gary Gygax after getting really baked off some [[Weed|special brownies]] and reading too much [[Lord of the Rings|Tolkien]]. The resulting game, called ''Dungeons and Dragons'' for its heavy emphasis on [[Bondage|dungeons]] and [[FYIAD|dragons]] has since sucked in hundreds of [[neckbeard|young males]] that might have otherwise had a [[Gay|sex life]], turning them into unfuckable losers only touchable by the most horse-faced bitches in the world (aka "female [[gamer]]s"). 

Gygax himself was [[Andrew Koenig|found dead in his basement]] on March 4th 2010 by Ed Greenwood and that faggot who came up with ''Warhammer: 40,000''. He will be missed by the small army of lolipop kids that he kept half-alive, chained in his basement, to pleasure his ''-1 Penis of Pederasty''.

A typical ''D&D'' session:

==Common Themes in all editions of D&D==

It is widely known that "''D&D''" - what the [[geek]]s call it - is a thinly-disguised means of teaching [[racism]] to children and [[teenager]]s, since certain races are considered "evil" in ''D&D'', whereas others are considered "good," for no real reason other than their appearance. [[Hippie|Elves]] all live at [[Earth First|peace with nature]] in and among the forests of the world. Every elf that ever lived is noble, wise, and decent with pale skin and beautiful features. Dark elves, unlike their Caucasian cousins, are naturally violent, evil and despicable bastards who get off on [[Pedobear|raping young children]]. 

In fact, these "Drow" are even more despicable than the ugly goblins slaughtered by the thousands. Gygax and [http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Realms_of_Valor#Dark_Mirror RA Salvatore] have both been very clear and open about this fact. However, since their god is called [[Lol]]th they get to justify pretty much anything by saying [[I did it for the lulz|God told them to do it]].

Besides teaching the fine morals of [[racism]] and claiming that god made you do it, ''D&D'' also is an entryway to suck [[Republican|god-fearing Christians]] into wicked, sinful [[Scientology|cults]] and [[wiccan|witchcraft]]. Countless souls have been lost due to suicide and fighting over characters (No! I'm playing the dwarf priestess of Pelor, you BITCH, not you!) and many more unreported mysterious deaths occur each year due to the mystical disturbances created by this tool of the Devil! It is also filled to the brim with [[Boobs|sex]] and [[lesbian]]ism! Here is one girl's harrowing [[no|true]] story:

Everything in D&D is [[bullshit|absolutely real]]! You can become a wizard, [[troll|rogue]], or [[FYIAD|dragon]] just like in the games. In fact, the company publishing D&D consorted with real [[Wicca|witches]] and [[Satan|SATAN]] himself to get all the spells absolutely accurate. Do them for yourself and see all sorts of amazing effects... like eternal damnation! 

Here it is in the words of several actual [[otherkin|real-life witches]] who helped Gygax make his "game". 


<div style="height:200px; overflow:scroll;">
Dungeons and Dragons is a tragic and tangled subject. It is essentially a feeding program for occultism and witchcraft. For Christians, the first scriptural problem is the fact that Dungeons and Dragons violates the commandment of I Ths. 5:22 "Abstain from all appearance of evil." Much of the trappings, art, figurines, and writing within D&D certainly appears evil-to say the least of it.

On top of that, the second issue is that the materials themselves, in many cases, contain authentic magical rituals. I can tell you this from my own experience. I was a witch high priest (Alexandrian tradition) during the period 1973-84. During some of that period (1976-80) I was also involved in hardcore Satanism. We studied and practiced and trained more than 175 people in the Craft. Our "covendom" was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; just a short drive away from the world headquarters of TSR, the company which makes Dungeons and Dragons in Lake Geneva, WI. In the late 1970's, a couple of the game writers actually came to my wife and I as prominent "sorcerers" in the community. They wanted to make certain the rituals were authentic. For the most part, they are.

These two guys sat in our living room and took copious notes from us on how to make sure the rituals were truly right "from the book," (this meaning that they actually came from magic grimoires or workbooks). They seemed satisfied with what they got and left us thankfully.

Back in 1986, a fellow appeared on The 700 Club who was a former employee and game writer for TSR. He testified right on the show that he got into a wrangle with the management there because he saw that the rituals were too authentic and could be dangerous. He protested to his boss and was basically told that this was the intent—to make the games as real as possible. He felt conscience-stricken (even though he was not a Christian at the time), and felt he had to resign from the company.

Now, the question becomes—if a person "innocently" works an authentic ritual that conjures up a demon, or curses someone; thinking that they are only playing a game-might not the ritual still have efficacy? I think we know the answer to that question. If you play at shooting your friend in the head with what you think is an unloaded pistol and don't know a shell is in the chamber, is your friend any less dead because you were playing?

People need to understand that God's universe runs on laws no less real in the spiritual realm than the laws of physics that propel a bullet out of a gun-and those laws are just as irreversible. God says that if you tamper with magic and the occult, you are stepping out from under His will and His protection (assuming you are a Christian). If you are not a Christian, then you are REALLY playing with fire.

==''D&D'' Characters==
[[Image:Lamergamerbear.jpg|thumb|This is you.]]
There is one kind of character in the world of ''D&D''.
* '''[[Faggot]]''': Your typical [[basement dweller|shut-in]] chucking dice while [[Pokemon|pretending to be a dragon]].


There are multiple subclasses of Faggot:

[[Image:wyrmlingneckbeard.jpg|thumb|A wyrmling neckbeard and level 20 [[Faggot]].]]

[[Image:Are you a wizard.jpg|right|thumb|Yes, and here are my [[Bloodninja|robe and wizard hat]].]]

[[File:Sadfur.jpg|thumb|right|[[sad|level 15]] [[furry|druid]].]]

* '''[[Leeroy Jenkins|Fighter]]''' - Played by [[Internet tough guy]]s, this character was designed for [[pussy|pussies]] who get beaten up a lot [[IRL]] and want to pretend to be tough. Also good for people who are too [[stupid]] to understand [[magick]]. 

* '''[[Abra|Wizard]]''' - This character can use [[magick]] and reading skills such as [[Telekinesis]] and [[PowerWord: IRL Name]].  Everyone plays a wizard because [[3Guys1Hammer|they kick ass]].

* '''[[Fred Phelps|Cleric]]''' - Played by those who like to be the [[bondage|heal-bitch]] for everyone else, especially fighters. Their magik involves calling on [[Jesus]] to do the same spells as sorcerers and wizards, only with funny names. The only exceptions are "evil clerics" who are basically wizards that do [[HAIL SATAN EVERYDAY|human sacrifice]] to make spells work. 

* '''[[X-Men|Rogue]]''' - Leaves creepy phone messages for your older sister. Also responsible for killing the party several times on botched disarm trap rolls, or through being a backstabbing SOB. Usually played by weeaboos who want to be like [[Naruto]] but wind up sucking because they spend all of their skill points in [[shit nobody cares about|shit that doesn't actually keep them or anyone else alive]]. Also played by greedy [[Jews]] who align themselves as chaotic stupid and try to [[typical|fucking steal everything]]. [[BBW|Big girls]] enjoy playing halfling rogues with 18+ Charisma to feel better about themselves.

*'''[[Buddha|Monk]]''' - A [[chink|kung-fu fighting]] [[David Carradine|warrior]] for the [[wapanese]]. At higher levels become [[over 9000|fucking invulnerable]] and [[shit nobody cares about|count as low-level outsiders]], but everyone plays a fighter instead because [[fact|everyone knows the wapanese are losers]]. If you want to play a monk, you need to become [[an hero]] first.

*'''[[Power Rangers|Ranger]]''' - [[hippie|Rangers]] generally wander around in the woods and smoke a lot of [[weed]] while surrounded by their [[PoeticIrony|Woodland Friends]]. They also can cast [[stoned|woodland spells]] to do crap like walk through trees, however they are not to be confused with [[Furry|Druids]] (who also cast woodland spells and [[bestiality|spend too much time around animals]]). Rangers can only dual wield or use a bow (they don't know how to fight any other way). If you encounter a ranger give them weed and they'll go away.

*'''[[Moralfag|Paladin]]''' - Your typical conservative christian who [[Insane|believes god has commanded them]] to [[pwn|smite unholy ass]]. All paladins must have a mandantory stick shoved up their ass and be members of the 700 club. Not to be mistaken for the ''[[World of Warcraft|/4th Edition paladin]]'', who are heal bitch cleric knockoffs.

*'''[[Drama|Bard]]''' - [[American Idol|Untalented hippies]] that use [[Dildo|instruments]] to cast spells similar to those of wizards and sorcerers, [[Woman|however of a weaker and more supportive]] grade. Often times the [[retards|smart people]] play as bards because they [[Switzerland|do not fight]] and thus never have to [[pussy|worry about dying]].

*'''[[furry|Druid]]''' - Is a [[pagan]] who puts on a [[fursuit]] and runs around yelling [[FYIAD|Fuck you I'm a wolf]]! Knows useless woodland spells like [[furry|skritch]] and pretends to be powerful due to the nine levels of spell progression, even though wizards kick their asses. Games like ''Baldur's Gate II'' had [[fursecution]] as a storyline in which [[furries]] attacked the town of Trademeet, which makes all the [[furry|druids]] very sad.

*'''[[Age of Conan|Barbarian]]''' - Like a fighter, only they're from the [[Middle East|uncivilized lands]]. Their special powers include getting into a [[Raeg|temper tantrum]] and the ability to declare [[jihad]] about three times per day so they can smack the shit out of everyone elsw. They're generally played by [[Basement dwellers|basement dweller]]s so they can pretend to have big muscular bodies instead of being pale punching bags.

*'''[[furry|Sorcerer]]''' - "[[FYIAD|Dragon-blooded]]" wizards with weakass spells they can fling constantly. This makes them the most commonly played class by [[otherkin]] and [[furry|bestiality enthusiasts]]. They are also a popular choice for pyromaniacs due to the many [[FYIAD|fire spells]] they learn such as ''Burning Hands'', ''Scorching Ray'' and ''Fireball''. PROTIP: ''Disintegrate'' means the party no longer needs a rogue.

*'''[[Uri Geller|Psion]]''' - [[Skullfuck|Fucks with peoples' heads]] and [[goatse|sometimes his own body]] to do shit. Usually played by [[e-psychiatrist|pseudo-intellectuals]]. Too confusing to play correctly [[shit nobody cares about|so nobody ever bothers]].

*'''[[Ted Haggard|Divine Prostitute]]''' - The only class worth playing where you [[whore|fuck other characters]] to heal them. Not available in all campaigns.

==[[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Noteworthy ''D&D'' Characters]]==

[[Image:Drizzt_Dourden_Anakin_Michele.jpg|thumb|Drizit Durden: [[Emo|elf ranger]] and total [[pussy]].]]
[[Image:Elminster.JPG|thumb|[[Lord of the Rings|Where]] [[Odin|have I seen]] [[Harry Potter|this guy before]]?]]

OK, so these don't exist... but these imaginary people apparently are [[Shit nobody cares about|important]] to ''D&D'' tards.


'''Drizzt Do'Urden''': Pronounced "Drizz-it Durdin." Drizzt is a drow elf who forsook the ways of his people because he is a total [[emo|pansy]] and [[attention whore]] who got tired of being bitchslapped by the [[lesbian|female drow]] for being a giant pussy. Hoping for attention, [[hugbox|love]] and [[fanbois]], he escaped to the "surface world," where everyone thinks that he is [[Retard|special]] because he [[stupid|fights with two scimitars]] and is [[black]]. Drizzt insists on writing [[TL;DR|long-winded cry poetry]] about his [[emo|emotions]] because he is supposed to be a [[Faggot|"deep character."]] 

Good thing that you can [[In the ass|rob]] him in ''Baldur's Gate''. ''[http://boards.ign.com/baldurs_gate/b5445/90804098/p1/?6 (Let's see how, shall we?)]''

'''Artemis Entreri''': Artemis Entreri is a merciless, ass-kicking machine who will [[Pain series|FUCKING RUIN YOUR SHIT]] if you touch him. He is Drizzt's antithesis: a cold, uncaring assassin who will murder you just because he really fucking wants to and you'd thank him, too, because you just got your ass [[pwned]] by the coolest fucking guy on the planet. He enjoys [[Murder|cutting throats]], [[Falcon_punch|giving surprise abortions]], and [[buttsecks]] with his foppish drow boyfriend, Jarlaxle. He has a sword that will [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Nazi_face_melting.jpg FUCKING MELT YOUR FACE] if you touch it without wearing a [[Condom|special glove]], and a dagger that drains your life if it touches you. He thinks Drizzt would look good as a toilet seat cover.


'''Elminster of Shadowdale''': This ugly old fool is a bastard combination of [[Lord of the Rings|Gandalf]], [[Odin]] and [[Harry Potter|Dumbledore]]. Apparently there was a special on blatant rip-off characters that day and this guy came out of the sale.

He is [[epic]] levels in wizard and [[elitist|archmage]], has many special [[dildo|item]]s and unique [[hax|spell]]s, and is the [[My Immortal|immortal]] champion of the [[Goddessmine|Goddess]] of [[Magic]]. He mostly does his best to be [[hikikomori|left alone]], but is always tracked down by various upstart morons looking to prove their worth. Elminster typically squashes them with his [[no|amazing]] [[otherkin|Speshul majik powaz!!!1!1]] and withdraws again into his nondescript [[penis|tower]]. Erroneously thought to be killed multiple times, he finally met his ultimate end at the hands of [[Harry Potter|Severus Snape]]. Like Drizzt, he also appears in ''Baldur's Gate'', where he fills the role of your usual [[Diablo II|Deckard Caine]]-type figure.

==''Dungeons & Dragons'': The [[Movie]]==
[[File:Tom baker.jpg|thumb|150px|Poor Tom Baker]]
[[Image:Dnd_5.jpg|thumb|Not even [[Scientology|brain parasites]] can explain this movie's retardation.]]

In 2000, a [http://imdb.com/title/tt0190374/ movie version] of the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game was released. It was an [[abortion]] of a film watched only by major ''D&D'' [[nerds]], and was widely ridiculed even by said nerds and other assorted [[basement dweller]]s. 

It "starred" a bunch of no-talent hacks, including [[black|Marlon Wayans]] (who was undoubtedly ostracized by his family afterwords) and Riff-Raff from ''Rocky Horror''. The only good actor (even though his part was small) was Tom Baker (pictured left) - [[Butthurt|AND HE DIDN'T EVEN WIN AN AWARD!]] 

The Sci-Fi Channel aired a second one that was slightly better but [[shit nobody cares about|noone gives a shit about it]], since it didn't have [[Doctor Who|Tom Baker]].

To save you the brain cells, the plot goes something like this. Some evil wizard wants to control all dragons to start some war and yaddayaddayadda. He sends his drug-addicted blackguard [[gay|buttbuddy]] to get some magical [[dildo|dragon staff]]. 

The fuck-up heroes find this out somehow and use magical toilet paper to find their way to the staff first. The addict finds them, snorts some really [[drugs|awesome coke]], then [[pwns]] them into next Tuesday. The [[hippies|elves]] save their sorry asses and recite some disgustingly [[Otherkin]]-style speech about how dragons must be protected. The [[an hero|heroes]] magically make their way to the top of some huge tower and fight the evil wizard, winning through sheer force of [[bullshit|plot contrivance]] alone. The wizard is killed and the druggie goes to [[blow]] some [[Wicca|druids]] to get another fix. The end.
{{-}}

=[[Srsly]], They've Released Four Distinct Versions of This=

Rule of thumb: New books are released just to milk more money out of a dying game system. 

Each new release = [[nerd]] [[raeg]] as nobody wants to [[otherkin|pretend to be a dragon]] with [[fail|outdated rules]].

==Version 1.0 - Of Steam Tunnels and Moral Outrage==
[[File:Mindflayer=tentacleporn - Pandora's Box.jpg|thumb|right|[[awesome|Fuck yeah]], [[Rule 34|I love D&D]]!]]
Whence all the wasted lives first come. The initial version had only six classes, an absurdly convoluted system for tracking your experience, and you had to pay gold to level up. It inspired a set of shitty eighties computer games you had to access with that fucking code-wheel, and provided many nude succu-boobies and orcs-on-elves gangbang bondage scenes in its artwork for pre-[[Internet|tubes]] nerds to fap with.

It also happens that it was the most drama-filled of all editions, never having been since matched. Five years after ''D&D'''s creation, Gygax and Arneson promptly fell madly to [[lolsuit|cannibalizing]] one another over who would get the rights to be blamed by history for creating this painful, clichéd mess. They also spent much time [[art theft|directly cribbing content]] from [[Lord of the Rings|various]] [[HAIL SATAN EVERYDAY|other]] [[Cthulhu|sources]].

It should be noted as well that this edition inspired the greatest [[Hunter S. Thompson|fear and loathing]] in [[Christfag]]s around the United States, as they perceived it for the [[Satanism|threat]] it truly was. The alarm was sounded when suicidal ''D&D''fag [[winner|James Dallas Egbert III]] got torn-up drunk and decided to [[an hero|end it all]] in a labyrinth of [[Metroid|steam tunnels]] somewhere near his house. However, he [[DO IT FAGGOT|pussied out]] and hid at his neighbor's; the [[police]], meanwhile, had developed the reasonable theory that James had gone full retard with his character and consequently become lost in the tunnels. After James' return this was disproven, but by then the media and professional Christians (bored with scary stories about backmasked subliminal murder commands) across the nation had already run with it, creating a cottage industry of opposing ''D&D'' and spreading a highly [[lulz]]y moral panic.

[[Image:Mazes-and-monsters.jpg|thumb|I cast ''[[Dickgirl|magic missile]]'' at the darkness!]]

Amazingly, the sheer inanity and crass commercial nature of ''D&D'' was lost on thousands of bleating Christians, who echoed their handlers' proclamations that it was a conduit through which [[Satan]]'s darkness corrupted the world. So was the near-universal inability of its players to do anything so vital or proactive as explore [[Dr. Steel|steam]] tunnels. Pointing this out did not occur to TSR, who folded up neatly in the face of Christian demands, excising every reference to demons and devils and replacing them with [[bix nood|nonsense words]]; this Chamberlain-style [[Hitler|appeasement]] had the same [[Poland|result]].

Eventually, though, everyone quit caring when the Christians moved on to [[The Spanish Inquisition|witch-hunting]] [[Satanic_Ritual_Abuse#The_McMartin_Daycare|daycare providers]] and James Egbert finally DID IT FAGGOT for some personal reason presumably unrelated to [[power level|experience level]]. This was not before a deeply [[mindfuck]]ed classic called ''Mazes and Monsters'' was made based on the steam tunnel delusion, starring future famous [[retard]] Tom Hanks. It is on par with ''[[Weed|Reefer Madness]]'' and ''[[BLACK FACE contempo|Birth of a Nation]]'' for rampant idiocy and mild ironic lulz.


===''AD&D''===

[[Image:Phasespiderblowjob.jpg|thumb|A phase spider's secret special attack.]]

The only [[bullshit|good]] edition [[Lie|where the classes were balanced]]. Notable differences between ''AD&D'' and other editions were:

*You had a saving throw for everything. A saving throw for [[aids|AIDS in the pool]], a saving throw for seeing your mom naked and [[what|even a save for surviving a resurrection attempt]].

*[[divide by zero|Thac0]]

*The only [[furries]] were low-level grunts for you to kill by the dozens.

*Everything went off percentages so you could play easily even while [[high]].

*The books that introduced [[Uri Geller|the Psion]] and [[shit nobody cares about|other related shit nobody ever uses]].

==3.0/3.5 - We're Off to See the Wizards==

[[Image:Phb v3.jpg|thumb|Clearly inferior. Initiate [[thinspiration|
purge]]!]]

After Gygax finally banhammered himself from ''D&D'', Arneson immediately divested himself of the albatross that was TSR by selling it to Hasbro subsidiary, cardstock megacorporation, and slavering [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[cult]] [[Magic|Wizards of the Coast]], for a job helping develop a game he created and a near-mint condition Black [[Annabelle Lotus|Lotus]].

Wizards saw this as an opportunity to troll ''D&D''fags for not having picked up ''Magic: The Gathering'' a lot sooner. So they [[System32|dumped the entirety]] of what Gygax and Arneson had created and made all the fanboys buy a completely new collection of books for $40 each. Even their ''Dragon'' magazines were now worthless except as [[fap|bathroom reading material]]. Resultantly, BAWWWWs were heard throughout the basements of the land, as neckbeards naturally [[Juggernaut|resistant to change]] warred with [[newfag|neophyte]]s who thought 3.0 was actually a [[Truth|better, more accessible system]].

[[Image:Phb35.jpg|thumb|[[Sarcasm|Such a noticeable improvement.]]]]

The rage from the conversion to 3.0 had not even fully subsided when Wizards decided to up the troll ante by casting Demonic Attorney and Contract from Below, and then releasing ''yet another'' new edition, the so-called Version 3.5. Claiming that it was absolutely necessary that everyone buy entirely new core books (at least) because Wizards hadn't got some of the skills balanced and the Paladin class was a little fucked up was the equivalent of [[Preview is for Pussies|ignoring the Show Preview button]] and spamming their entire fanbase with outrageously overpriced [[m|minor edits]]. Of course, hackers on steroids just download the books' [[bittorrent]]s, but do you know how long that shit takes if hardly anyone is seeding?

And what books they were, too: entire sourcebooks devoted to [[Jews|wandering around the desert]], whole tomes full of nothing but shitty prestige classes no PC will ever want to use (Apostle of Peace? Thayan Knight? [[CSI|YEEEAAAHHH]]), books simply reprinting the contents of other books, and the ''Book of [[B|Vile Darkness]]'', which was so bad they had to cave to the Christian remnants still bothering and put some cheesy warning label on it about its epically dark content. It's seriously about as vile as a ''Doctor Who'' episode. 

As a final blow to their beleaguered buyers, after having obsolesced everyone's old ''Dragon'' magazines, Wizards then decided to cancel the venerable nerd staple altogether, converting it to a completely [[shit|digital]] format and, from there, stopping it altogether. This was in preparation for Wizards' grand, ultimate vengeance on the game that had so long cut into ''Magic'''s profits and shouldered it aside at Christian expos on the Devil's fantasy-themed recruitment tools... Richard Garfield's [[final solution]]: 4th Edition.


==4th Edition ''Dungeons & Dragons''==

[[Image:WoWBitchKing.png|thumb|''4th Ed Players' <strike>Expansion</strike> Handbook'']]
[[Image:Warcrap.jpg|thumb|...and the ''Monster Manual''.]]

One day, the fine folks at Wizards of the Coast discovered, to their dismay, that they were only raking in several billion dollars a year from their ''Dungeons and Dragons'' products. In part, they were all out of ideas - their final few 3.5 splatbooks included the laughable "Rules Compendium": a monstrosity that lists an incomplete grab-bag of rules ''in alphabetical order''. Additionally, players were beginning to feel that there was - you know - ''enough''. The wizards boards had a "Character Optimisation" forum, where players would pull obscure rules from the various splatbooks and combine them in non-obvious ways to create game-breaking characters ([[shit nobody cares about|I had a player ''Shapechange'' into an Eberron "Living Spell". A ''Living Spell's'' spell effect is '''Su''', not '''Sp''', so technically ''Shapechange'' can do it.]])

You get the idea - just plain old ''too many'' rules, too many books. For a company that makes its money by printing and selling a new hard-cover rulebook each month, this was devastating.

In order to fatten their wallets, they decided to come up with a new edition of ''Dungeons and Dragons'', one that did away with annoying and unnecessary things like flavor, creativity, flexibility, role-playing and complexity, and instead catered to the illiteracy, short attention spans, and mindless stupidity of the Ritalin-addicted, ADD-riddled fucktards that comprise the majority of ''World of Warcraft'' players and internet junkies.  Thus, Fourth Edition ''Dungeons And Dragons'' was born.

Let's not beat around the bush: playing Fourth Edition ''Dungeons and Dragons'' is about as pleasurable as getting raped in the ass with a 24-inch spiked dildo while being forced to watch Rosie O'Donnell masturbate. Fourth Edition is the worst festering pile of shit ever to have been unleashed upon the human race, and even makes games such as ''[[Runescape]]'' seem like a gamer's paradise by comparison.

Enormous effort has gone into making the rules "balanced", which they have taken to mean "orthogonal". Consequently, every character is simply a permutation of every other character. Swap Fort and Reflex saves and rearrange your stats, and your fighter is now a rogue. Spells no longer do anything interesting ("Levitate" is gone. ''Levitate''!) - smacking someone with a spell is ''exactly the same'' as shooting an arrow at them, except maybe it does energy damage. IOW: all the spells are gone except ''Magic Missile'' and ''Fireball'', and every class can cast them. Combat is simply about mashing that 'X' key as fast as you can, which is once per round. For everyone.

4th Edition promises many improvements over previous editions, including:
[[Image:DND furfag monster.jpg |right|thumb|Typical [[Courage Wolf|4th edition monster]].]]
[[File:Nazi face melting.jpg|thumb|right|So many stupid spells!]]
* '''Swordman''': A character type which emulates the combat-oriented character classes from ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.
* '''Spellman''': A character type which emulates the offensive-spellcasting character classes from ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.
* '''Healman''': A character type which emulates the defensive-spellcasting character classes from ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.
* '''Stealman''': [[Troll|Your average lying troublemaker]], mincing the thief-class from ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' 
*'''[[Gentlemen|Gentleman]]''': Typically a rogue with a balisong.
**New and flavorful abilities, such as:
***[[beaner|Fast]] Spell: Makes your spells fast.
***[[goatse|Wide]] Spell: Makes your spells wide.
***[[retard|Strong]] Spell: Makes your spells strong.
***[[Awesome]] Spell: Makes your spells awesome.
***[[fail|Wisdom]] Spell: Makes your spells wise.
***[[camwhore|Charisma]] Spell: Makes your spells charisOH FOR FUCK'S SAKE SOMEONE PLEASE KILL ME, I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!!
*'''[[Ahnold|Machineman]]''': That's right, they made [[Gundam|giant robots]] for this round, except they're all [[gay|male]] eunuchs. Enjoy!
* '''[[Dragonmorph|Dragonman]]''': aka Trogdor, a race designed for 13-year-old boys who wish they were dragons. Dragonman art typically features reptilian humanoids with breasts, which makes no sense whatever. Also a [[Furfag|power gamer race]]; banned from all campaigns.
** '''[[Furfag]]''': A template automatically added for free to any animal-based character type which grants the character access to a [[deviantART]] account.
* '''Improved Protection from [[Poontang]]''': An effect granted by ownership of any ''Dungeons & Dragons'' materials, this has been enhanced for 4th Edition. Clinically proven to preserve [[virgin]]ity.
* '''Free can of [[Neckbeard]] Growth Ointment with purchase of boxed set''': Presumably, this is included to help turn non-players onto the hobby, since everyone knows the set of [[neckbeard]]s is coextensive with the set of ''Dungeons & Dragons'' players.

Your character's abilities are based entirely on [[capitalism|the stuff you (the player) owns]] in this game. It's taken all the irony out of playing ''Munchkin''. Buying miniatures, new books, fancy dice, [[LARP|costumes]], and other [[Crap|official ''D&D'' paraphernalia]] grants your character stat bonuses. If you ever lose your items your character (and pocketbook) are [[gg|screwed]]. Not getting stuff for your character means you will not get past [[pwned|level one]].

RIP, Dungeons and Dragons. 1974 - 2008. [[no|you will be missed]].
