'''Anti-lulz''', like [[santorum|anti-matter]] for that matter, is the exact opposite of [[lulz]]. Diametrically opposed, if you're clever enough to know some long words. Anti-lulz can be described as anything and everything that is [[The Internet is serious business|serious business]], like the [[internets]]. Anti-lulz is extremely rare and can only be produced in environments that are toxic to all non-[[gay|retarded]] human beings, such as [[Uncyclopedia]], [[Gaia Online]], [[Vampire Freaks]], [[B/|/b/]], [[the LURKMORE wiki]] or [http://sportscarforums.com/ Sportscarforums]. However, anti-lulz, much like anti-matter, will create a violent explosion of [[TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL|Spartan]] proportions when it touches its pro-lulz counterpart. This explosion would destroy everything in its path, and it would also make [[User:Theburk|Theburk]] [[shit|empty his bowels]] into the luscious awaiting mouth of his equally [[ugly]] [[User:Core|"life partner"]] (which in and of itself is not a rare occurrence).


Anti-lulz can also be the feeling you get when [[you]] have been [[troll]]ed at [[your mom|someone else's]] expense. [[Emo]]s are the major producers of this brand of anti-lulz, which was once known as "frunz", but that was changed because it's [[lame]]r than [[lame]].

Recently, another form of anti-[[lulz]] revealed itself in the shape of '''[[Alex Wuori|The Lulzkiller]]'''. Hellbent on destroying [[anonymous]], The Lulzkiller doesn't even hesitate on forging an unholy alliance with [[Fox News|the Devil]]. [[Some argue]] that The Lulzkiller is the supreme avatar of anti-lulz.

Anti-lulz reached an all-time high during [[May 2007]], when [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] was [[gay|down]].

== The sound of anti-lulz ==
Anti-lulz is emitted mainly in environments filled with [[fail]] and [[AIDS]] (along with trace amounts of [[Jenkem]]). Anti-lulz is also usually accompanied by anti-drama, which consists of the [[internets]] flowing freely with nobody ever fighting with anyone else, [[evar]]. In severe cases of anti-drama, [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]] have been seen hugging, but they [[delete fucking everything|vehemently deny]] any such [[anal sex|action]] ever taking place. They refuse to admit that they did it for the anti-lulz, and they must be made to suffer the [[holocaust|brutal consequences]] for their anti-lulzy behavior.

While regular lulz sounds like [[Media:Lulz.mp3|this]], anti-lulz has only been recorded once due to the danger of hanging out in such Gaiafag environments; the recorder, [[User:WhiteMystery|Martin Jeston II]], later shot himself [[in the ass|IN THE FUCKING FACE<small><small><small>(lol)</small></small></small>]] [[last Thursday]] after dealing with PTLD (Post-Traumatic Lulz [[AIDS|Disorder]]). It also sounds a little like this:

The easiest way to hear anti-lulz is to <s>buy</s> pirate at least 2 seasons of ''[[The View]]'' and force your cat to watch it '''DO NOT WATCH IT YOURSELF'''. When the inevitability of your cat's death occurs, you must record its death rattle. This is anti-lulz.

Jeston's recording remains the only surviving documented recording of anti-lulz known; it was taken from a [[Gaia]]fag writing serious articles on [[Uncyclopedia]] while [[masturbation|fapping]] to [[furries|furry]] [[porn|pr0ns]]. The sound of the anti-lulz while the faggot types on his keyboard is extremely disturbing, and anyone [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND|under the age of 9,000]] should not listen to it.

Oh, the horror.

If you really need to know, frunz is emitted on a huge scale by aardvark-games on Amazon.

== I did it for the anti-lulz ==
The [[dubious disclaimer]] that must be said whenever causing anti-lulz in order to clear your conscience. However, you will need to say it [[less than three|more than three]] times in order to do so, unlike "[[I did it for the lulz]]", because anti-lulz [[Anonymous|is very hard to forgive]]. For instance, if you hold open a door for a black person [[bitch]] or a Jew, you did it for the anti-lulz; to purposefully prevent lulz. Causing anti-lulz is now classified as a [[war]] [[internet police|crime]] and will result in [[Saddam Hussein|brutal consequences]]. A group called The Anti-Lulz Team of America, which specialized in killing [[American]] lulz (the best and most [[fatty|fattening]] kind) was formed in [[Last Thursday|1999]] but soon changed its name to [[LJ Abuse]], with [[moar]] lulzkilling power than ever before.

== Example of anti-lulz in lulz-related contexts ==
Since "[[Lulz#Lulzing balls|lulzing balls]]" is defined as "''to have some sort of [[sex]] with them - not necessarily [[fellatio]]''", anti-lulzing balls would be [[cock block|turning down the offer of sex]], and instead announcing that [[fag|it would be best to wait until marriage]].

Additionally and ironically enough, compounded overuse of the word [[lulz]] itself is known to cause anti-lulz.

== Emo anti-lulz ("frunz") ==
After being milked as a [[lolcow]] and being [[trolling IRL|trolled IRL]] for long periods of time, even the most [[erection|hardened]] internet warriors will succumb to this particular type of anti-lulz. Once known as "[[gay|frunz]]", it was renamed by the [[Rachelle Waterman]] Memorial Internets Drama Association ([[IAWTC|RWMIDA]]) and merged into the current definition of anti-lulz.Everyone with a decent education knows that if you are emo, you die, then the world hails you as a [[An hero|An hero]]. An example of this is [[emoscene.com]]

===The Anti-Joke===
An Anti-Joke is a normal joke with the punchline replaced with a reasonable [[IRL]] ending. "Two guys walk into a bar...and then they enjoy their afternoon." While many anti-jokes are heavily infused with anti-lulz, whenever an anti-joke generates [[frunz]] for those who listen to it, an equal amount of [[lulz]] is generated for the one telling it. Generally, only very long anti-jokes can successfully generate a [[frunz]]/[[lulz]] pair.
