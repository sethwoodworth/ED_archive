Cbox Drama
'''Cbox Drama''' is a frequent occurrence on [http://skow.bythost18.com websites] that have a [http://www.cbox.ws/ cbox]. It usually involves a dozen or so [[16-year-old girl|teenage girls]] with opposing opinions. Instead of discussing the subject like [[lolwut|mature young adults]], the teen girls choose to [[flame|use more direct methods]] and be [[bitches|unmindful of other people's feelings]]. It goes like so:

Girl 1: Even though the results of the contest are three weeks late and you keep breaking your promises with us, I still love this site! You're doing an awesome job!

Girl 2: All the wait is starting to upset me. It's rather unprofessional.

Girl 3: YOU BIATCHHH!!

Girl 4: How could you say that, Girl 2?!

Girl 5: I know, right? Don't listen to Girl 2. She's just PMSing.

Girl 6: so, uhh... anyone watching the Olympics?


As you can see, Girl 6 pulled a powerful maneuver known as [[BRILLIANT!|Changing the Subject]] to relieve the tension. The flocks of girls then proceed to forget about their [[flame war|discussion]] and talk about [[lol|curling]]. Men from the website's community usually sit back and watch the action with much amusement, then go on to suggest that this absurdity be turned into an ED article.
