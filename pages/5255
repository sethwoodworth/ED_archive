Mcclane
''This article is [[old|Encyclopedia Dramatica history]]. You can help by [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Mcclane&action=edit digging up the past].''

'''Mcclane''' is the founder of LiveJournal Review [http://www.livejournal.us]. What ever happened with that?  Some serious shit went down between him and [[Scarlet]] and pretty much everyone else. I don't know what was up with that.

Mcclane's last known abandoned blog site is [http://www.mcclane.org Mcclane.org], which he started after realising that LiveJournal Review was [[old meme]].  It contains exactly the same kind of entries as LiveJournal Review, but at vastly depleted levels of comments and, for this reason, often reads like a slowly posted chatlog between two people who hate someone with a [[LiveJournal]].

Known wife-beater.
