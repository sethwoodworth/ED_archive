Advice Chris

[[Image:Advicedog.png|thumbnail|Example of the original meme.]]
A spin-off of the original [[Advice Dog]] meme, '''Advice Chris''' employs the same premise of putting foolish advice or other dumb phrases on a colorful picture of a character's face. Where Advice Dog's background is a fairly simple rainbow pattern, subsequent Advice memes have adopted other patterns and color schemes. In the case of Advice Chris, the rainbow pattern is used, with Chris's head pasted in the center. While the text for Advice (X) memes can say virtually anything, the Advice Chris images are naturally expected to be somehow related to things Chris has said or done. 

The meme has also been applied to [[troll|fan]]-favorite character [[Pot|Yawning Squirtle]], with the text typically referencing the dazed and confused look on his face.
