'''HTML''' stands for '''Hyper Text Markup Language'''.It is something [[you]] have no idea how to use. You can use simple HTML to create [[cock boat]]s.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) makes web pages display properly on the World Wide Web. It is a markup language, which means it has a mix of a normal language that people can read, and a special programming language that tells computers what to do. HTML is sent and received through HTTP.

A web browser is the program that reads the special language in HTML. This language tells the web browser how the web page should look. The web page can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. It can also have writing that is not shown in the web page, which tells people about the web page—for example, the name of the person who made it.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops HTML. The latest version is XHTML 1.1. It uses XML and can include other XML-languages. 

TL;DR: HTML is serious fucking business.

The creator of HTML was [[Ajsiu]].

==Example==

<html>

<head>
<title>Title of page</title>
</head>

<body>
Body of the page
</body>

</html>

==Most Important HTML tag==
Stick this code onto a page that lets you do DIV tags,: 
<pre><DIV id=Layer1 style="BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px; BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px; Z-INDEX: 1; LEFT: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px; WIDTH: 1000px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px; POSITION: absolute; TOP: 0px; HEIGHT: 10000px; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000; layer-background-color: #000000">
<center><font size="4"><br></font><font face="Tahoma"><span style="font-weight: 400">
<FONT color=#ff0000 size="4"><p>!!>> EDIT THIS <<!!</p></font>
</pre>

It will rape them.

==Second-most Important HTML tag==
You can drive people batty by posting this:
<pre><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td width="150"><center>oooo
<marquee width="100%"behavior="alternate" direction="left">
3=========Ð</marquee>&nbsp; O</center></td>
<td width="40">
<marquee width="100%" behavior="scroll" direction="right">~° ~° ~°</marquee>
</td></tr></table></pre>

==Third-most important html tag:==
<pre>
<div style="text-transform: uppercase;">
</pre>
<div style="text-transform: uppercase;">
