Culture is the term used to define a set of [[whore|behavior]], [[Almost raped|trends]], [[castration|traditions]], [[buttsex|sex life]], and [[wikipedo|status]] that groups of specific people use to make them selves feel [[Assburgers|special]] and different from the rest of people.

There are basic 2 categories of culture: Internets culture and IRL culture.

== [[IRL]] Culture ==
We will be focusing on [[American]] culture since [[noone]] gives a shit about foreign cultures, since they are all total [[Europe|Eurofags]] anyways. [[some argue|Many anthropologists agree]] that there are two types of foreign cultures; men with black hats looking at useless art and making useless poetry (found in English class), and tribes hopping around in [[furry|feather costumes]] and cooking up useless medicine made out of endangered animals (found in social studies videos). To start off, one of the biggest things that defines America is their ability to consume resources excessively, and their god-given right to the rest of the worlds [[Vespene gas|oil]].  They are the most important nation in the world who needs to constantly remind everyone to [[nevar forget]] [[9/11]], and how they can kick the shit out of any other country.

American culture prides their rich spoiled whore celebrities Like [[Paris Hilton]] to be good role models for the [[prostatot|younger generation]].  The American Dream is winning a frivolous lawsuit against a fast food corporation, and '''''always''''' [[Victim complex|playing the victim]].  It's never your fault.  America is a nation of entitlement... you are ''entitled'' to that SUV, you are ''entitled'' to cheap gas, and will go to any length <strike>to bomb</strike> free the shit out of any country that threatens the American wayâ„¢.

== [[Internets]] Culture ==

Internets culture is far more corrupt than IRL culture in every single way due to the fact that it is ruled by [[teenagers]].  In IRL, media, politics, news, and every discipline is done by [[mature]] adults.  However on the internets, everything is ruled by [[angst]]y social rejects who waste their lives playing [[WoW]].  Yes all the most nerdy angsty teenagers you can remember from highschool are ruling the internets, which is why it is such a cesspool of unnecessary [[drama]]. That's bad enough, but adding the anonayminity that internet use provides makes a bad creature worse.  To get an idea of what this makes, think of what would happen if you gave a retard a shot of [['Roids|steroids]] and [[cocaine]] directly into the frontal lobe.

One of the biggest examples of teens in power is [[Wikipedia]] which most administrators are still in [[school|highschool]].  This is the reason why wikipedia is full such frivolous bullshit like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_droids the list of minor Star Wars droids]  (which is about roughly 3 times the length of the "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth History of the earth article]".

===Nuturing Stupidity===
[[Image:Truth furries.jpg|thumb|This is deemed "normal" on the internets.]]
One of the biggest things about internet culture is that if you have a belief or have a fetish, no matter how screwed up and wrong it is, there will '''always''' be a place on the internet for you that has other like minded [[fags|people]].  So in a way, the internet nurtures dumb, sick, fucked up behavior.  Up until recently, in [[IRL]] you would probably be lynched for [[Furry|running around in a fursuit]] , but on the internet you are a '''''magnificent wolf who is in touch with his inner animal spirit and sexuality'''''.  The sad thing is that Internet culture is spilling into IRL culture, and with the addition of Liberal Guilt we can't to a thing to stop this [[faggotry]].

This is the reason why the internet makes you stupid.

===Now NOW <big>NOW!</big>===
With the advent of high speed internet, everyone is obsessed with instant gratification which leads to more and more [[ADD]] cases for ever shortening attention spans.  [[YTMND]] & [[4chan]] are good examples of hyperactive behavior encouragement.  Some people get to the point where their whole lives could be spent on 4chan mashing the [[F5]] key.

==Going and Fucking Yourself==

Are you inadvertently offending your [[goatse|'online friends']] with your well intentioned [[email]]s?
