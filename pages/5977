'''[http://www.oldmencrying.com Oldmencrying.com]''' is a [[troll]] website whose stated aim is to turn guys into penis-bearing Oprah addicts by showing off the [[delicious cake|delicious tears]] of men crying at all occasions.  And to prove it, all one has to know is that they use a picture of [[old media|Dan Rather]] crying in the banner with comment "...and I'm cleansed, spent, and a little moist".  While some [[old media]] sources such as the [[CNN|Communist News Network]] have called the website a habitat for [[sick fuck]]s, the site's creator was supposedly inspired by his own father's tears.

There's a lot of intellectual wankery going on here.  Lots of the content is filled with essays, "art", and research.  However, you will find comedic gold in the Images and Multimedia sections.  The pic of [http://www.oldmencrying.com/images/gates-crying.jpeg Bill Gates crying] and the video of [[fundamentalist|Jimmy Swaggart]] telling [[America]] [http://www.oldmencrying.com/images/jimmy.ram "I have sinned!"] is A+++.

You can also buy a [http://storetn.cafepress.com/0/7439390_F_store.jpg tear catcher bib].

There is also a [[message board]], but you have to register in order to view any of the posts.  That must mean that they don't want trolls.  Isn't that a pity.

Sadly, the site hasn't been updated since 2005 since the last images included are those of the [[Azn]] [[tsunami]] victims. This means that they missed out on archiving the [[lulz]] caused by the [[pwn]]ing of [[New Orleans]] by Hurricane Katrina, which resulted in many a [[nigra]] shedding many a tear.
