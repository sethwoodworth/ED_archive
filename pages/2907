Feem
feem (also known as 'get away from me' and 'oh my god please no') was an ex- [[Bantown|bantown]] operator and hunchbacked Jew with a penchant for [[Hooker|hookers]] and [[Sodomy|sodomy]]. He'd be into [[Cocaine|blow]] too if he didn't continuously max out his credit cards on [[Camwhore|camwhores]] in a futile and desperate effort to abate the terrible, black [[loneliness]] he felt inside. <br> <br>

'''July 4, 2010 feem died in a tragic car crash. He was a magnificent creature, it is sickening to imagine his fall from grace. Needless to say, he was taken too soon and will be missed ;_;'''

Also, he got killed because he nuked 420chan servers.

==Oh look, it's that guy==
As a child feem had many little ditties written and sung about him, such as:
:''feem, feem, go away, because the very sight of you fills us with dread and despair''
:''You're feem, so we scream, for you are a hideous pervert who is constantly trying rape and murder us''

==Stranger Danger==

feem was a stranger even unto himself. If you were to encounter a shuffling hunchback moaning about root access and molestation, '''run away, run far away'''.

==On [[ED IRC]]==
  01:14 <@feem> seriously, fucking pancake on a motherfucking stick
