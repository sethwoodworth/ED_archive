'''John McCain''' is a [[Borg]]-like giant malignant [[cancer|melanoma]] tumor with few human traits left who planned on world pwnage if elected.  He should have died while he was imprisoned in Chinkland.

Born [[at least 100 years ago]], McCain would have surpassed [[Dick Cheney]] as the nation's oldest chief executive, becoming the second President to suffer from [[Ronald Reagan|Alzheimer's]] and the first to suffer from [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]].  Facing criticism from the Republican Party that he's too [[liberal]] and from the Democratic Party that he's too [[conservative]], McCain whined as he made his claim to be the ''The [[Angsty_teen|Maverick]]'' [http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/maverick.htm] but is also a secret founding member of the [http://www.lemonparty.org Lemon Party]. He also likes [[buttsecks|surprise buttsecks]] and is a pirate [[irl]].

In his final [[Masturbation|masterstroke]], McCain recruited the [[Retard|amazing]] [[Sarah Palin]] after Republicans showed that even they had [http://www.gorelieberman2000.com/ more sense] than to take [[Joe Lieberman]] aboard.  McCain is [[LOL|absolutely inscrutable]], and the correct response to any criticism of his policies is: "[[baw|FUCK YOU! HE SPENT FIVE AND A HALF YEARS IN A P.O.W. CAMP!]]"

==Biography==
[[Image:Mccainlake.jpg|thumb|McCain being [[rape|rescued]] by Vietnamese locals after [[Vietnam War|accidentally crashing his multi-million dollar A-4 Skyhawk jet]] into Trúc Bạch Lake.  McCain's [[alcohol|blood alcohol content]] at the time of the crash was .25%, five times the legal U.S. Navy limit.]]

John McCain was born on April 1, 1869; son of a Jew in the [[Amerikkka|United States]] [[Homosexuality|Navy]]. Dad or granddad now has an aircraft carrier named for himself. 

Throughout John's education, daddy's [[Money|Jew gold]] bought him the right to slack off and [[Unwarranted self-importance|reputation]], which carried him through his education. Good thing, too, because he turned out to be a [[Fucktard|complete fucking moron]], graduating [[WTF|#894/899]] from his [http://www.thestar.com/News/USElection/article/299874 class at the Naval Academy], his [[stupid|sorry]] ass only being saved by daddy's reputation.

Whether or not he has the [[assburgers]] is not yet known; he will have his [[Lemon Party|staff]] look into it after they figure out how many houses he has.

John McCain was one of the most 1337 pilots of all time, probably second to Amelia Earhart. He was so good at his job of pilot that five of his planes crashed. One of the more humorous crashes happened in 1967 aboard the USS Forrestal. Anxious to bomb some charlies, he let kerosene pool in his engine so he could take off with a bang. However, when he started, he was surprised that the sudden flame coming from his engine cooked off the bombs in the plane behind him. McCain managed to climb out over the bodies of 134 crew and 161 injured. When asked about this, McCain replies, "[[I did it for the lulz]]". John McCain was finally shot down while bombing strategic dog farms and enemy rice paddies around Hanoi later that year, but he parachuted into a lake. Happy locals showed their thanks by pulling him to shore and beating the shit out of him. They also built a monument celebrating his near drowning.   

He implies that he was [[torture|tortured]] by North [[Vietnam War|Vietnamese]] soldiers for several years but they put him up in the Hanoi Holiday Inn (situation being reversed, he wouldn't have lived, but is he grateful?). The Hanoi Holiday Inn wasn't good enough for a McCain, so he made propaganda broadcasts for the Vietnamese [[Communist|commies]] on Radio Commie Vietnam to weasel his way into a berth at the Hanoi Hilton. He's probably best known for his long-running lounge act at that famous nightspot, giving aid and succor to [[gook]] troops (McCain's way of describing his benefactors) with witty stand-up routines, smooth melodies, and helpful lists.  

The Vietnamese media speaks of a fisherman who rescued John McCain in return for oral sex in the winter of 1968. Leung Ong Lhan, now 78, says that McCain "[[cocksucker|sucked my cock]]".

"At first I was just giving them these things because I felt sorry for them, but Lieutenant McCain insisted on 'returning the favor.' I never knew what a '[[fellatio|swirly]]' was until we took McCain prisoner. I could have gotten him to do whatever I wanted at the time," says Leung through a translator. "I'm sure I could have gotten anal had I been into it." 

McCain, attempting to connect with evangelicals, has all of sudden found massive faiyth! He enjoys recounting a prison story from his POW days to [[Joe Lieberman|all his "friends"]]. In his account, a prison guard would sneak into his room naked while John was asleep and then gently loosen the ropes on John, then come back in the morning and tighten them up again. How sweet! This prison relationship climaxed on Christmas Day when the guard drew an adorable cross on the ground for McCain to strain his neck and look at. "We were two Christians, just worshiping together", a grateful John McCain explained to his "friends". Whoever is elected, America can expect to enjoy the same sort of relationship with the next administration.

After coming home from five wonderful years of Gay Gook Fantasy Camp, he discovered his beautiful wife had been fux0red in an accident, leaving her paralyzed, cancer-ridden, and fugly. He immediately proceeded to [[lulz|openly cheat on her]] before dumping her for a the hot daughter of a guy who made his fortune through [[srsly|organized crime]]. He launched his political career mainly by mooching off Cindy's dad, though he would still blow a guy in an alley every now and then for old times' sake.

During the 80s, [[shit nobody cares about|he and a bunch of other guys accepted kickbacks to deregulate the banking industry, leading to the Savings & Loan scandal that lost over 9000 old peoples' life savings]]. Of the [[The Power 5|Keating 5]], McCain was the only one who avoided jail time, mainly by ratting out all the others. Ever since, he's portrayed himself as a changed man fighting political corruption. [[IRL|In reality]], he's just a normal Republican with the appearance of credibility.

In 2000, Bush won the Republican primary against him by claiming McCain fathered a black kid. Lulz were had by all.

Irrespective of whether McCain actually makes it to office or not he will always be remembered for the part he played in the famous Lemon Party Photoshoot. The culture defining photos which took the world by storm were taken when he was at his prime in 1930, with only a modest 42 malignant tumors eating away at his insides. significantly As a young teen Sarah Palin used to rub off to these very photos on a daily basis as a means of escaping the sexual boredom and backwardness of rural Alaska and her father.

{{quote|He's a Maverick.|[[Sarah Palin|Sarah "Broken Record" Palin]]}}
Senator McCain's Campaign has been a dis-organized mess from the beginning. McCain has had to discard any of his "Maverick" policy stances in preparation for this presidential bid, in order to appeal to the mongoloids that comprise its base. He wouldn't have even made it through the primaries if Baptists were at all capable of voting for [[Mormons]] or big city sleazebags. In an increasingly stupid attempt to further solidify his party base, McCain made the surprise announcement that he was nominating then unknown Alaska Governor, [[Sarah Palin]] to be his vice president nominee! I'd hit it!

Since picking the Eskimilf as his running mate, everything about her has caused most of America to [[shit brix]] en masse at the prospect of her anywhere near the White House. Polls indicate she was the single biggest drag on the McCain campaign, and McCain only at the end seemed to realize how badly he fucked up.

{{quote|At least I don't plaster on the makeup like a [[slut|trollop]], you [[cunt]].|McCain to wife Cindy}}

This section is all [http://www.drudge.com/archive/106692/author-mccain-called-wife-cunt-trollop true]. [[Srsly]]. His high school nickname was Mr. McNasty for his hothead temper.  In front of his campaign staff he scolded his wife for gently ribbing him about his hair loss and robot heritage with, "At least I don't plaster on the makeup like a [[slut|trollop]], you [[cunt]]."  

On his experiences in the 'Nam he said, "I hate the [[azns|gooks]]."  About the gooks, he said to a staff college intern, "At least they didn't ask me what I think about the [[niggers]]."  To [[New Mexico|Senator Pete Domenici]], "I wouldn't call you an asshole unless you really were an asshole."

On the totally not not, not not not not not not biased ''Huffington Post'', Jewmors are floating that McCain shoved an old lady with an O2 tank and a wheel chair into a wall back in the dizay. Turns out she was wondering where her MIA husband was and she was hoping McCain could take a look-see. She asked him how the search for the real soldier was and he walked away. She pumped her arms and sped after him, wheels a turnin' and then grabbed him. At first he raised his arm to slap this ho but like the maverick he is, he reached across the aisle and shoved her into the wall for massive damage. 

When questioned about the incident, his staffers at the time said "He did it for the lulz"

[[Image:McKKKain.jpg|thumb|John McCain at a typical campaign rally]]

Having alienated so much of his own party, one wonders who supports this guy. The GOP base consists of the Nation's [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTx531t8XNo Patriotic], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ50oZRVTuw Conservative], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vagD-4AH4Vc White], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHrExRHZnm0 Pro-life], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4wQfQtpDAc Christian], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTx531t8XNo Patriotic],  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaxECcTjCuw Under-educated], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxzmaXAg9E Scared], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itEucdhf4Us Hateful], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKUovpF9LWU 'Mercans]. Strangely, McCain does manage to pull some support from confused Mexicans, the gooks he hates, and the random blacky now and again, like this guy:

==[[Bel-Air|Summary of how he failed the election]]==
Now this is a story, all about how<br>
my campaign got flip-turned upside-down.<br>
Now I'd like to stay for 4 years, but 'bama got bigger<br>
I'll tell you how I lost the election to a nigger.<br>

In western Arizona, born and raised,<br>
In the Senate, is where i spent most of my days<br>
Chillin out, votin, proposin' all cool<br>
and all runnin for the prez after strokin my tool<br>

When this liberal nigger, he was up to no good,<br>
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood.<br>
I got in one little race, my party got scared, and said:<br>
"You better win it this time or we'll all shit in your hair."<br>

I whistled for my Palin, and when she came near,<br>
her hair was in a bun, she had rings in her ears.<br>
If anything, I could say that this bitch was dumb,<br>
but I thought, 'man forget it, Sarah, lets run'!<br>

I-went-up to the podium, thinking I had won,<br>
and I said to mah supporters, 'yo holmes, thanks, its been fun'<br>
but it turns out I lost, I just said, "go figure"<br>
but I was still super pissed, that I lost to a nigger.
