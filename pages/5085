'''MS Paint''' is a shitty program that has come bundled free with every version of Microsoft Windows since Windows 1.0. For two decades, no noticeable improvement had been made to the program until the launch of Windows 7, but it's still considered to be inferior to an etch-a-sketch, often taking an [[Tartlet|average user]] [[Over 9000|over nine thousand]] hours to complete a single shitty picture.  It is used either by those who do not have the ability or knowledge to run something better on their computer, too [[Retard|retarded]] to get a [[LOL|trial]] [[Photoshop]]® off [[LOL|the official Adobe® Photoshop® website]] and then use a crack to unlock it, or real [[1337]] users who [[pwn]] those high end software assholes with every byte they create. The same goes for MS Paint. Most [[n00bs]] on such sites as Furry-Paws.com and Funnyjunk.com use it to make shitty avatars using every color on the toolbar and the preset box tool.

With the release of Windows XP MS Paint was now able to save with .gif and .jpg formats. Technically MS Paint can also save files with a .png extension, but since it has no idea how PNGs work, it simply saves them as a .bmp that ''looks'' like a .png, knowing that no one stupid enough to use the program will be able to tell the difference. It's just as well though, after all bmps is [[THE BEST]] OF ANY IMAGE FORMAT OUT THERE and should always be used by preference anyway, as it makes much smaller images of <s>greater quality</s> [[lies|bullshit]].

It has been observed in the Windows 7 beta that Microsoft did, in fact, finally change MS Paint (the first since Windows 1.0), to use the same shitty "ribbon toolbar" [[lies|bullshit]] as the incredibly not-buggy Office 2007. It also has several new brushes for [[n00bs]] to ruin good [[shoop|shoops]] with, but unfortunately Microsoft tends to not release things less than 6 months after the supposed "release date".  

==Code==
The raw code of MS Paint has been compared to a [[retard]] taking a [[crap|dump]]. If you still use MS Paint but have a [[shit]]box [[computer]] ,are too much of a Jew to <s>buy</s> pirate [[photoshop]], and too much of a total idiot to even consider using traditional media, consider trying [http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/paint.net/ Paint.NET], the [http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/paint.net/redirect/mirror_263_src_coral.html code] for that is much nicer. Also, [[Awesome|using MS Paint can cause Herpes]].

==Pictures==
The [http://www.mspaintporn.net/index2.html pictures most people create] on MS Paint look like a dump that a retard just took on your screen, except in 16 colors. And in fact sometimes, people create "Sprites" that are supposed to be similar to the kind you would see in a pre-3D video game. [[Shit nobody cares about|8 bit sprites tend to mostly be Pallete Swaps of Final Fantasy or Megaman Sprites, while 16 bit sprite edits (The most popular kind thanks to Bob and George) often tend to be Megaman 7, Sonic, and Mario or Final Fantasy. On the rare occasion spriters will make 32 bit sprites with twice the amount of colours than Megaman 7 sprites, but these are much rarer than 8 bit and 16 bit sprites, which are easier to do. 32 bit sprites tend to be Megaman 8, Megaman X, or Sonic Game Boy Advance with the occasional use of Megaman.EXE or Pokemon from the Game Boy Advance]]. With the Nintendo DS and PSP, the use of sprites are likely going to stop all together since only [[Japan]] actually still makes sprites to keep the game loyalists from bitching.

Also, check [http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/17/2009/07/504x_mspaint_wow.jpg this shit out.]

==WTF Art==
MS paint has a website totally devoted to [http://www.mspaintporn.net MS paint porn] where [[fags]] make and upload their own shitty drawings using only MS paint. It is honestly just one big fat competition to see who can make the most disgusting picture.
Draw yours today and become a [[retard | 1337 haxxor]]

Also, it is a proven [[fact]] that [[Wikipedophiles]] have [[Wikipedia:File:Mt_Shasta.JPG|too much time on their hands]].

Another strange thing people, mostly [[wimmenz|girls]], have been creating is Dollz, which involves pixel shading, [[emo]] poetry on the side, and lots and lots of [[cutting|self-injury]]. These Dollz have been floating around Freewebs for some time now and it needs to be fucking noted what pieces of fail they are. 1 in 20 Dollz are actually ''good''.
Most dolls are just for shock value. This is evident, because nearly all of the dolls have slashes, sex, bones, boobs, drugs.....

== How to use MSPaint ==
MSpaint is a very hard to learn experience, and it will be a painstaking journey from whether you are gonna work with the cunt-sucking piece of shit pencil tool, or with the those stupid fucking lines. Overall it takes this new product called; '''PATIENCE''', and it would really help you on that subject. But since [[over 9000]] out of every 10,000 people sucks at MSPaint. chances are 1 out of infinity you are gonna become a MSPaint master. Fag.

{{quote|so I wanted to draw some [[Cocks | pictures]] on<br>my Mac and it was liek, "bleebleebleebleep<br> FAIL, gb2 ur PC"|[[Ellen Feiss]]}}

[[Apple | Macs]]  simply don't have enough [[Penis | megahertz]] to handle enterprise-quality software like MS Paint, and Macfags must [[Raep | content themselves]] with [http://opensword.org/Pixen/ crap] [http://paintbrush.sourceforge.net/ ripoffs].
