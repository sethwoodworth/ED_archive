Sharecash DDoS
[[Image:Sharecashbutthurted.jpg|center|1150px]]
<center>'''The day that 4chan received chemo; Again.'''</center>

EDIT: Everything below this edit is false. What happened was, one little Anon bruteforced Sharecash's ftp client (Username: Axe08 Password: Axe08Axe08 LOL) and then when he changed the password, the anon blasted the forum with a 32k botnet. That's why the site was fucked that night. It had nothing to do with the idiots 'LOICing' the site.




Between December 18 and December 22, 2009, a revolution that started on '''[[s|/s/]]''' would become one of the greatest [[4chan]] wins since [[last Thursday]]. as a result of this, the shitstorm of spam has now stopped, and many people now hail [[moot]] again (even though he's a furfag homo).

== Before the DDoS ==

4chan, as usual these days, was filled up with spam, fail, and rate my cawk threads. Sometimes, you could start lurking and find a whole page with pure [[CP]] spam. No OC, no lulz and the destruction of [[/hc/]]. Shitty right?

Many people claimed this spam shitload was made by moot, since no one did shit about it, and it kept going on for months and constantly growing.

Usually servers would go down for hours, and /b/tards had to escape to /x/ (only [[oldfags]] know that /x/ is /b/ when down).

Something had to be done. But what? Who? How? '''Keep reading bitch'''

== moot acts ==

Suddenly one day, moot posts on /s/ (greatly affected by spam). (Divided in three parts so you can read while you read this article)

== Operation Legion/Sharecrash ==
Eventually news of moots on-going crusade against Sharecash reached the [[/b/tards]] of [[4chan|/b/town]] and immediately shit got real.
What followed was one of those rare occasions where the [[internet hate machine]] actually wakes up and decides to take the fight to the enemy, and thus Operation Legion/Sharecrash was born. 
[[Image:OPERATIONLEGIONDOIT.jpg‎|center|Turns out yes he did need to spell it out, but at least it worked.]]
Co-ordinating all their efforts into a mass [[DDoS]] pile-on, [[anonymous]] made short order of forcing Sharecash's forums offline. Amazingly, this <s> was all the warning Sharecash needed and a swift addition to their rules has seemingly left [[anonymous|anon]] free to [[troll]] another day. [[Fail|Failed]] like everything /b/ does and needs to be addressed in more depth by the tech savvy /i/nsurgents at 888chan.org</s> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS]]!!!

==Sharecash responds==

Sharecash describes their [[rapage]] in their own words on their [http://sharecash.org/blog/ blog]. Like any rape victim, they deny they were raped.

{{quote|One method our users have used to receive downloads has been to post links on 4chan.org. Over time 4chan users have complained about the spam, ultimately leading to the 4chan owner, a man who goes by the name of “moot”, to create a topic on how to fix the spam problem. Many 4chan users took this as a “call to arms”, as they called it, and created many separate groups with the aim to destroy our website. This quickly spread over many different websites, and soon enough there were thousands of people attempting to attack us.

We stayed on top of the attacks and watched as they attempted to break in. We set up a fake login script and spread it so we could log all the attacker’s IP addresses, and we watched as they all tried to gain access to our fake page. Eventually we posted the IP address log on our main page, which prompted many 4chan users to email us apologizing and offering to help us solve the issue. To see the log of IP addresses, go here: [http://sharecash.org/attack_log.txt]

As they unsuccessfully tried to gain illegal entrance to our server, others attempted to simply crash it. Many used poorly made flooding tools, which our DDoS protection quickly blocked. A certain member of 4chan, a 15 year old from [[West Virginia]], attempted to flood our servers with a botnet he had created, which he claimed had 30,000 zombie computers. While he used many proxies, we still managed to retrieve his real IP address: 24.126.30.244, which has been reported to the authorities for botnetting. Even with his attack, the server still managed to stay up. We ended up taking our server down for a few hours voluntarily to add extra protection and wait until most of the attackers had grown bored. When we brought it back up the flooding and DDoS’ing started again, but there was little to no effect.

Other attackers managed to get personal information of one of our administrators and some of our advertisers, and attempted to harass them. This did not do much, but we did manage to get a nice list of phone numbers to report. Here are a few for the curious: 418 516 2342, 703 819 4502, 481-516-2342, etc…

We had decided to ban 4chan link posting in order to appease the attackers. However, it became apparent that they did not care about the spamming, but simply wanted to harm us. Even after we changed our policies, they escalated their attack attempts and continued to try to take our server down. After we sent an email to moot he placed a notice on 4chan saying to not attack/harass us, but the attacks have continued all day long. We have also continued to receive email after email threatening us.

So until further notice and until we speak more with moot, here is our new policy on posting links on 4chan.org. If you are caught constantly spamming on 4chan with the intent of receiving downloads, and we receive a report of this, we will first delete the files you spammed as a warning. If you fail to comply with our rules and warnings and continue to repeatedly spam 4chan.org, you will then be permanently banned.

The new policy is currently pending and may be revised further after we talk with moot. Thanks for bearing with us everybody!}}

==Spammer dox==
[[João Bernardo]] was one of the main 4chan spammers who contributed to the cancer. He wrote an e-book about how to make money spamming 4chan with child pornography, and made the grave mistake of releasing his personal email address ([mailto:bernardovalenca@msn.com bernardovalenca@msn.com]) in the book. After a few wanna-be spammers bought his half-assed ebook and posted it on http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php?t=1554154 public webforum, 4channers seized the moment and hunted down all their d0x, available [http://pastebin.ca/1724469 here]. The lesson? Don't fuck with 4chan.
