BLP
[[Image:Jcartoon.gif|thumb|One of the many problems with [[TOW]]. Encyclopedia Dramatica doesn't suffer such problems because there is only need for [[lulz]], not [[shit nobody cares about|verifiability]].]]

'''BLP''', short for '''biographies of living persons''', is an official policy on [[Wikipedia]]. It was introduced by [[Jimbo]] in early 2006 after he was suffering [[butthurt]] due to the fact that his wiki had been [[pwnt|manipulated]] by a [[vandal]] which led him to believe he could have been in [[legal]] trouble for his website saying that [[John Seigenthaler]] killed [[JFK]].

The policy basically states that Wikipedia must always be ultra-[[conservative]] when it comes to publishing information about people's lives ([[ironic]] considering that [[Conservapedia]] stated that Wikipedia was "[[at least 100|six times]] more [[liberal]] than the American public"). This means that despite the [[fact]] that pictures of [[Amy Winehouse]] appearing on the front page of British [[tabloid]]s being [[coke]]d up, [[batshit crazy|confused]] and [[drunk]] are a daily occurrence, their [[article]] about her only mentions her [[butthurt|personal trauma]] for a couple of sentences. This is "speedily endorsed" by [[deletionist]]s such as [[Sceptre]].

The entire policy is merely based around Jimbo's need to avoid being sued for libellious information, so that he can keep that money donated to the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] to pay for the services of [[Russia]]n [[hooker]]s and stays in expensive hotels with [[Rachel Marsden]].

==What the Wikipedia hivemind and its critics have to say==
BLP is a problem - just one of many problems that Wikipedia faces. Some [[Bureaucratic Fuck]]s have made plans either to delete all BLPs not included in a paper encyclopedia; others have been less extreme and suggested semi-protecting all BLPs so that [[newfag]]s cannot interfere with something which could potentially be very [[cash|costly]] to Wikipedia. There is currently a discussion underway about whether borderline non-[[notable]] people should be allowed to have their articles deleted at their request, called "biographical optout", just one further sign that if Wikipedia was ever good, it's suc[[cum]]bed to pressure from the [[IRL|real world]] and the progressive dreams of the [[internet]] [[geek]]s who were there in its [[oldfag|early stages]] have now been [[ruin|shattered]].

The [[Wikipedia Review]] and Daniel Brandt have been very [[moralfag|vocal]] in making their [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=17382 opposition to BLP known]. This is a good thing because it means that TOW admins get a taste of their own [[drugs|medicine]] when Brandt collects info about their real-life identities to prove a point about how [[rape|intrusive]] BLPs are on the lives of ordinary people with successful careers that warrant a few mentions here and a few mentions there (in [[reliable sources]]), leading to a Wikipedia article being created about them.

==BLP deletion==
The [[Australian]] party boy [[Corey Delaney]] had his article deleted by a special process known as [[wikipedese|WP:BLPUNDEL]], despite massive media coverage over a period of a few weeks, perfectly meeting verifiability standards by any normal person's judgement. [[David Motari]] suffered the same fate, and [[Angela Beesley]] temporarily did. This shows yet more [[Co$|abuse of power]] by Wikipedia [[sysop]]s, who are free to make a decision about such cases at their own [[fapping|discretion]].

[[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is the antithesis of BLP. All ED articles must adhere to the extreme [[lulz]]ing of living persons at all times. The [[pleasure]] of writing for ED is [[over 9000]] times more than that of writing for Wikipedia. You can make personal [[attack]]s. You don't have to follow an arbitrary set of rules. You're allowed to write with [[original research]] - hell, you can say whatever you fucking want. You don't have to cite sources to provide facts that were already fucking obvious in the first place to anyone who is not a [[retard]]. You don't have to suck [[cock]]. You don't have to live in fear, paranoid that someone from the cabal is going to say something bad about your actions.

[[Gemma Anscomb]] is an example of an ED article which falls [[shit|afoul]] of BLP, yet it is in the first page of [[Google]] results when searching for her name. The BLPfags repeatedly say that articles about people famous for one event, who've had their 15 minutes of fame, should not have Wikipedia articles because that is not an accurate summary of that person's whole [[life]], and due to Wikipedia's current Internet prominence, these articles could affect the subject's life in a negative way permanently by staying up. Some extremist [[Wikipedophile]]s have even gone to the extent of blanking [[AFD]] debates in such cases because they believe that even these are potentially legally problematic, despite the fact that it's much easier to find information about these people on [[blog]]s and [[forum]]s everywhere, so that Wikipedia's standards are taken to the extent of [[faggotry|pedantry]].

Hell, if the [[Brian Peppers]] TOW article was a BLP [[bomb|landmine]], then [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is a highly dangerous and vast BLP minefield, and Wikipedos [[typical]]ly fear it more than they would treading in [[Asia|Cambodia]] under [[Pol Pot]]'s regime, or [[Serbia|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] circa 1995.

==BLP and [[death]]==
Since [[Wikipedo]]s [[cocksucking|love]] BLP, they also want all [[notable]] people to [[death|die]]. If someone dies, they don't enforce BLP, unless it is a "[[Wikipedia:Recent deaths|recent death]]". For some strange fucking reason, they enforce BLP on people who have recently died. No explanation has been given for this [[bullshit]]. Wikipedos are also known to love [[Death List]] because it means that [[moar]] [[notable]] people become dead, which is exactly what they want because their [[CoS|cult]] celebrates death.

If [[you]] are notable, you can also troll Wikipedia by pretending to become [[an hero]], but not actually, and escaping to South America like the epic IRL troll [[Nazi]] [[Wikipedia:Aribert Heim|Aribert Heim]] ([[seaking|FUCK YEAH]] [[Josef Fritzl|AUSTRIA]]), who did it for the [[lulz]]. You will then end up in the category [[Wikipedia:Category:Possibly_living_people|possibly living people]], and if you've [[cocksucking|contributed]] to Wikipedia, there will then be an [[edit war]] over whether you can be included on [[Deceased Wikipedians]].
