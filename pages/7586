Small
<small>The opposite of ''[[Big|&lt;big&gt;]]'' and the favourite [[HTML]] tag of [[emo]] [[fags]].

==Usage==
The ideal time to use ''&lt;small&gt;'' is during the creation of [[color bar]] codes. Always make sure to use at least two ''&lt;small&gt;'' tags for the caption. But NEVER close the tags, so that when [[fucktarded]] [[scenewhore]]s fill their [[userinfo]]s with your ugly color bars, their text will grow ever smaller, eventually disappearing out of view completely.

==Example==
