Alex Chiu

'''Alex Chiu''' is an [[azn]] fraudmaster who sells finger-magnets to [[16 year old girls|gullible morons]]. The magnets supposedly grant immortality through the power of, um, magnetism, and Chiu insists that he will enjoy an eternity of fucking up computer equipment and sticking to elevator doors.

Chiu, like many frauds and weirdos, has attracted attention from [[Uncyclopedia]] faggots and their ilk who pass [[old meme]] links around and giggle so hard over their own wit that they [[diaperfur|piss their pants]].

==Radio interview cock up==
Once, in a radio interview, a host asked Alex Chiu if he spoke Chinese, since he is of Chinese descent. Alex Chiu, being a compulsive liar and utterly retarded in terms of foresight, said that he did indeed speak Chinese. The radio host said a few simple words to him in Chinese that any moron who had taken a remedial Chinese class or bothered to look it up on the internet would have understood. Sadly for Chiu, his only response was an epically lulzy protracted silence as his deceitfulness and idiocy was revealed yet again.
