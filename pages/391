Used to hide what you're looking at on the [[internets]]. If you live with your parents, surf the net at work, or you're a closet homo with a straight roommate, then your [[masturbation]] session includes lots of Alt+Tabbing.  For instance, you might tab away from [[goatse]] back to [[Disney]]'s website (or possibly the reverse, depending on how perverted Disney gets). Unfortunately, Alt+Tab will not pull your pants back on, nor remove the mystery goo from your hands.

==Instructions==
When someone walks into the room, calmly perform the following:
# Cum
# Freak out
# Try to pull pants up
# Remember that the [[porn]] is still on the screen
# Hold the Alt key
# Press Tab
# Tell your mom that you weren't jerking it to [[furry]] [[porn]]
