Consensus
'''Consensus''' is what a [[Wikipedia]] "[[cabal|we]]" mob reaches so as not to hurt its [[pedophiles|members]]. Even if the [[Shit nobody cares about|outgroup]] disagrees.

Example:

*"We have reached consensus that 1 + 1 = 3." So it must be true.
*"We have reached consensus that Encyclopedia Dramatica is an [[attack]] site." So it must be true.
*"We have reached consensus on no [[original research]]." So "original research" is bad.
*"We have reached a consensus that [[rape]] is bad because we are dickless morons."
*"We have reached a consensus on [[Magnet|how a fucking magnet works]] - [[Magick]]!"

Among other such [[SNCA|important]] shit.
