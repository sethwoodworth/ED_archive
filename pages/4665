{{quote|"People think it's African, but it's not. I came up with Kwanzaa because black people in this country wouldn't celebrate it if they knew it was American. Also, I put it around Christmas because I knew that's when a lot of bloods would be partying."|Dr. Karenga, ''who stole his PhD from the [[white man]]''}}
Kwanzaa aka  "Christmas Ape goes to Summer Camp", is an black person and Pan-African holiday celebrated from 26 December thru 1 January (this way negros can afford to buy shitty, affordable, marked-down, presents that no one bought from Christmas). It is a 8-day festival which celebrates theft, [[rape]], drug abuse, alcohol abuse, spousal abuse, graft via welfare, [[communism]], murder, genocide, and civil war. [[noone|Millions of Black Folks around the world]] celebrate Kwanzaa, especially nations where Fried Chicken and Watermelon are plentiful and cheap in the grocery stores.

== Origins of Kwanzaa ==
[[Image:Halturdner.jpg|thumb|[[Hal Turner]], founder of Kwanzaa, eater of [[chikins|chikinz]]]]
According to [[TOW]], Kwanzaa was conceived in 1966 by Dr. [[Hal Turner]], professor, Department of [[lol_wut | Black Studies]] at California State University, Long Beach to celebrate black people, but instead wound up becoming the best visible [http://www.blackpeopleexist.org/ proof] of how black folks fails ([[Gay | WP:V]]). Of course, since [[TOW]] is run by [[fags]] and Wikinazis bent on revising the truth into lies (If you haven't already, now would be a great time to read George Orwell's ''1984''), the real story as to what the fuck [[bullshit|Kwanzaa]] - AKA ''Coonzaa'' - is all about is that it's quite simply [[Ebonics]] for [[Christmas]] and Jew rolled into one, with the seasonal colors all deliberately fucked up. 

[[TOW]] lies aside, Kwanzaa was actually invented by '''Dr. Maulana Karenga''', who, due to having been traumatized as a little pickaninny by a [[Santa Claus]] in a local shopping mall who refused to let Karenga sit on his lap because he smelled worse than Santa himself did, decided to extract his revenge on whitey by inventing a bogus holiday only for black folks. Kwanzaa is just that - a fake holiday that would keep niggers from making white folks and [[Jews]] rich by spending their welfare checks and whatever swag they robbed from little old ladies during the Christmas season. Not that it worked, because even the most retarded pickaninnies and little niggers know Kwanzaa is [[fail|total bullshit]], and refuse to let their supposedly enlightened parents be Grinches. As a result, Kwanzaa is now celebrated immediately after Christmas, otherwise every nigger who lives in a land where Christmas is celebrated would ignore it even more than whitey does. Even our first Black First Family does not even celebrate Kwaanza. 
This is a fake holiday created by a man after he went to prison for going Rick James on two women in his nigger cult for putting crystals in his coffee.

===What Does The Name "Kwanzaa" Mean?===
Depends on black person is telling the story. According to Karenga, the name signifies the first rape celebrations of Africa's Zulu tribes in the 1800's against White colonists of both sexes, and the hatred for the White Man. In Zulu and Afrikaans it means "Dead White Man" - in fact, this was usually the battle cry of most black person tribesmen just before they were killed by [[Tarzan]] and his elephant herd - while in Swahili it means "Fried Chicken Now Being Served!" In Ebonics, where Karenga first heard the word used outside of a movie theater, it means "Light'em Up, Bro!", while in standard American English - or any other form of English, for that matter - it means "[[redundant|Lazy Nigger's Day]]".

===What Do De Brothers Claim Kwanzaa Be Alls About?===
The usual bullshit about "black power" and Fried Chicken ''uber alles'', natch. But, as [[Hal Turner]] claims, it's much more:

:''As a Negroidian and Pan-SHOOP holiday celebrated by millions throughout the world LAZAH community, Kwanzaa brings a cultural message which speaks to the best of what it means to be a slave in the fullest sense. Given the profound significance Kwanzaa has for WOOP SHOOPers and indeed, the world LAZAH community, it is imperative that an authoritative source and Æ be made available to give an accurate and expansive account of its origins, concepts, values, symbols and practice. Moreover, given the continued rapid growth of Kwanzaa and the parallel expanded discussion of it and related issues, an authoritative source which [[AIDS]] in both framing and informing the discussion is likewise of the greatest importance. Therefore, the central interest of this Æ is to provide information which reveals and reaffirms the integrity, beauty and expansive meaning of the holiday and thus [[AIDS]] in our approaching it with the depth of thought, dignity, and sense of specialness it deserves.''

So, when you get down to the heart of it all, Kwanzaa is still just the usual bullshit about "black power" and Fried Chicken ''uber alles''. [[goatse|Right on]], bro.

=== What Happens During Kwanzaa? ===
Not much worth a fuck, unless you're black person. You get to ''officially'' skip work and smoke blunts, and some convenience stores actually run 2-For-1 specials on Colt 45 and Boone's Farm products bought with food stamps. As part of a seasonal offer, KFC sells watermelon the entire 7 days of Kwanzaa, while Popeye's will give an extra drumstick with every 10-piece. Oh, and there's something about lighting seven candles on a Jewish menorah, traditionally stolen from a nearby synagogue, but since it's total bullshit anyway we'll just leave it at that.

=== Do Black Folks Give Presents During Kwanzaa? ===
Sure they do. But only what's either bought or stolen *after* the After-Christmas close-out sales. If you paid full retail for the gift, or bought it before Christmas and/or Hanukkah, it doesn't count as a Kwanzaa present unless you stole it.

===Is There a Kwanzaa Equivalent To Santa Claus? ===
Nope, although there *almost* was one. The Reverend [[Al Sharpton|Fat Albert Sharpton]] was originally going to play the role of Father Kwanzaa, whose job was to rob white children of their presents and give them to black children. However, Al discovered that he was too fat to fit through most doors and windows, much less chimneys and fireplaces. When it was suggested that he use magic to get down the chimneys just like Santa, Al refused on the grounds that Santa used ''white'' magic, and since there were no <u>black</u> magic spells to achieve the same effect...well, let's face it. Al was going to play a "father figure", and we all know that black males like Al Sharpton aren't suited for such roles. Still, there are the ''Fat Albert'' cartoon shows that were based on Sharpton's childhood that are still used to teach black kids how to survive in a late 60's ghetto, so go figure.

[[Some argue]] that the Kwanzaa pimp is the official bringer of happiness 'n shit during this festive time.

===Is There A Kwanzaa Equivalent For Jesus?===
Of course not. As Tyrone Sambo Karenga hated [[The Man]], he had to abhor his religion. His inspiration was to [[nigga stole my bike | borrow]] the Jews their ethnocentric cult and their genuine hatred of Jesus, and build a similar antichristian cult around the [[fail | idea of deified blackness]]. That's why Kwanzaa is just the [[electric boogaloo]] version of [[Hanukkah]], complete with  boredom, menorah and dreidelz, all made out of deepfried chicken bones. This could also be qualified as a major selfpawn as it will lead all blacks in hell, [[truth | where all non-christians go]].

In this pathetic mess, it was planned to use [[Martin Luther King]] as a "Christ" figure for Kwanzaa. However, market research showed that not even the most devout black person would buy a manger scene set in a ramshackle shack in the middle of a sharecropper's field, surrounded by cotton and watermelon patches, with three black jazz musicians showing up with gifts of Ripple, Gold Fillings, and Blunts. The same market research also aborted plans for a merchandising tie-in featuring action figures of MLK and other Nigger Civil Rights activists.

===Are There Any Kwanzaa Songs?===
A few. Most of them are sung by '''[[Chris Brown]]''', '''Tupac Shakur''', '''Akon''', or '''[[wigger|Eminem]]'''. The most famous one is by '''Snoop Dogg''', entitled ''Gin And Juice''.

Note that '''[[cunt|Fergie]]''' was supposed to have released a Kwanzaa Songs album for 2007, but after having come to the realization that she was *not* black after all, abandoned the project.

==The Seven Days of Kwanzaa==
'''Day 1''' - Lighting of the first candle and ceremonial rounds of eggnog mixed with [[alcohol|Olde English 800]].  A day of rest.

'''Day 2''' - Lighting of the second candle and some [[Drugs#Cannabis|fatties]]. Remember to pass the dutchie on the left hand side.  A day of rest.

'''Day 3''' - Lighting of the third candle. Day three is reserved for the [http://www.nathanielturner.com/karenga2.htm ritual torture of your two most fly bitches].  Another day of rest.

'''Day 4'''- Lighting of the fourth candle, which is then promptly shoved [[in the ass]] of the kidnapped white wimmenz in attendance.  Sit yo black ass down, its a day of rest.

'''Day 5''' - Utter destruction of the fifth candle by a 9mm slug, courtesy of the annual drive-by from your neighborhood Crips (Who dress in green for the occasion) or Bloodz (Who dress in red for the occasion).  Sit at home, do no work.

'''Day 6'''- Lighting of the sixth candle. Preparation for the final night: beepers are paged, aluminum foil is purchased, rides are in the shop [[pimp my ride|being pimped]]. A general day of rest.

'''Day 7''' - Lighting of the seventh candle and round-robin tin-pipe of crack rock, followed by general rioting and looting. [[KFC|Chikken]]s, collards, and watermelons are naturally feasted upon with great gusto. Rolling, hating and patrolling commences throughout the night, and those caught [[Riding Dirty]]™ are dealt with accordingly.

'''Day 8''' - Reserved for [[prison|posting bail]].
