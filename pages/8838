Vox Day
[[Image:Cheers1.png|thumb|160px|How leftards describe Vox]]

[http://www.voxday.blogspot.com/ Vox Day] is a [[libertarian]] troll baiting the Americunt Establishment from Europe, he fled [[at least 100 years ago]] before they threw his father in jail for protesting the income tax of the [[Jewnited States]] government. Unlike the [[before the internets|American Revolution]] though, his dad intended no war and had no army so it ended in [[fail]] when the [[FBI|party van]] caught up.

[[basement dweller|Vox spends his days]] writing books and trolling the internets professional victim classes, such as [[Women]], [[Leftards]], [[California|Mexicans]], [[Jews]] and Arab. He vigorously defends the right to [[rape|sexual intercourse for males]] especially with [[asking for it|feminists]] and thinks voting should be restricted to [[whitey|rich white men]] ([[jews did wtc|although excluding Jews]]).

[[shit no one cares about|During his 7 year reign of blogging]], the waaaaambulance has been dispatched countless times to the typical [[BAWWWWW]]fags who say he never thinks of the children and to [[internet hate machine|pls pls stop the hate]], omg!! Jews meanwhile, like [[Asshole|Michael Medved]] (who no doubt helped do WTC), did not like his use of history in attacking those who say deporting over 10 million illegal immigrants from America is a logistic impossibility, [[fact|asserting that the Germans were able to accomplish it in a few years]]. This obviously made Vox a [[Nazi]], and therefore an enemy of all Jews, and since with Jews you lose, Vox is not allowed to be a [[Al Gore|mainstream intellectual]] now. Ever.

After spending epic days upsetting the net citizenry (particularly [[Atheists]] with [[Asperger's Syndrome]]), Vox reverts back to just a regular Eurofied Americunt - he likes to relax with [[wow|video games]], [[Minnesota|his NFL team]], [[faggot|alcoholic beverages with little umbrellas in them]] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqv8UJc72SU European soccer].

== '''Early life and career''' ==

Vox was born into an [[kkk|average white American family]], a precocious child, he was able to figure out that [[truth|women's rights are wrong]] by 5 years of age. His father [[intelligent|did the science at MIT]] and before Vox could be [[Al Franken|retarded functionally and intellectually by the Minnesota state school system]], his dad burst into the house and was like 'Yo homes to Bel Air!' The [[unlimited disposable income|boost in money]] meant Vox could avoid schooling years interacting with [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|the wonderful new people who immigrate]] to seek out [[lie|a better life in the USA because they love what America stands for]]. A good sprinter, Vox competed at Division 1 college level [[niggers|surrounded by other elite athletes]]. His first love though, was gaming, and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXQCrOEx1-g after the daily rigours of study were over] he went on to [[Geek Squad|form a gaming company with a fellow mate from Minnesota]]. Post-college Vox also founded the industrial-techno band Psykosonik with Paul Sebastien in 1991 [[faggotry|due to his love of dance music]]. Being a typical intelligent punk kid in his early 20s with a rich family, [[douchebag|he also decided it was time to acquire the customary Porsche and drive it fast]].

== '''Worldnetdaily and the birth of trolling activism''' ==

Eventually, [[loser|his love of gaming and improvements in computer technology]] led to a writing gig at [[neocons|Worldnetdaily]], where he was to be surrounded by [[Republicans|other privileged white people]] and their [[Joe Lieberman|token minority supporters]].

3 days after [[9/11|9/11]] occurred, Vox chose to write a political piece that basically was a rally cry to [http://www.wnd.com/index.php/index.php?pageId=10850 yield no more freedom] when the [[New World Order|ensuing response from the federal government got under way]]. It was well-received, and through it a political troll was born. 

Being a through and through brash and wealthy Americunt, Vox did not give a fuck who his victims were or how he would logically demolish them. In 2002, he decided to weigh into the [[Islam|Greatest Love Story the world has ever seen]] by suggesting that the [[bullshit|peace-loving Arabs who want to co-exist as fellow semite brethren next to the Jews in the historical region of their ancestors]] might want to reconsider their stance, as it would be [http://www.wnd.com/index.php/index.php?pageId=13179 common sense for their approach to be imitated and ratcheted up over 9000 times to acquire strategic balance]. His considered thoughts on the issue led to a bunch of love letters being delivered to his inbox from the [[terrorists|Council on American Islamic Relations]].

== '''Vox Popoli''' ==

Plenty of libertarian [[nerds]] who sat in their mum's basement all day began to heart the edgy Vox and his super-edgy haircut. So much so that soon they were [[stalking|sending emails asking when he would start blogging]]. Vox thought it would be a good idea to spread the hate to all the libtards and neocons - he set up [http://www.voxday.blogspot.com/ Vox Popoli], a play on the Latin term which suited his [[ego|delusions of granduer]].

[[Image:Regulars.jpg|thumb|160px|Typical Vox Popoli regulars showing how fucking insane they are]]

At first Vox didn't allow comments, worried about the [[4chan|vast stench of communication that freaks and losers would come to contribute to his posts]]. But he eventually snapped after weighing the upside of ego stroking to the downside of drive-by hating. Over time, a development of regulars began to surface, and the results were disturbing. A random mix of Geeks, Grumpy War Veterans, Spartans, Jews, Drunks, Rednecks, Azns, Psychos, Femmos, Drug Addicts, the Mentally Unstable, Yankee Bankers, Gun Nuts, Conspiracy Theorists, Desperate Housewives and Wheelchair Bound Gimps appeared.

Through some of the interactions Vox was able to deduce critical feedback from contributors, then bash them over the head with it. No one was safe and Vox tormented anyone and everyone, increasingly showing his [[gothic]] humour tendencies to all and sundry. But like all [[Hitler|egotistical megalomaniacs]], he got bored with his small circle of American political establishment trolling and decided to expand outwards, towards [[Richard Dawkins|recognised Scientists]] and [[Jews|Global Economists]].

Formerly a writer of novels, Vox realised that there was plenty to troll in the real world now that people were listening to him, and his fantasy realm of pretend could stay in the background while he tried to anger [[circle jerk|those who had become accustomed to acclaim from their fellow intellectual peers]].

== '''The Irrational Atheist and The Return Of The Great Depression''' ==

As the 2000s decade moved into the last half, Vox deduced that Atheists were getting bolder and noisier all over the internets and figured this would be a perfect group to inflict [[butthurt]] on. He wrote [http://irrationalatheist.com/downloads.html The Irrational Atheist], which consists of historical data and facts highlighting Atheist deeds and declaring overall and in the title that no, they are not the mostest rational people in the modern world. [[BAWWWW|This upset atheists to no end]]. Sensing their anger, a [http://tell-em-to-get-stuffed.blogspot.com/ retarded Vox fanboy] rose to their whinging by baiting them even more on You Tube, which led to further butthurt as they tried to trash the videos in the ratings and the comments.

With the success of the Atheist Trolling Campaign of 2008, and with the global economy slowly devolving into what would become a Global Financial Crisis, Vox decided that he would next go after the [[libtards|elites]] and [[jews|bankers]] who were failing the people of America and the world. With that, he produced [http://www.amazon.com/Return-Great-Depression-Vox-Day/dp/1935071181/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255037695&sr=8-8 The Return Of The Great Depression], a book documenting the [[illuminati|failed economic and monetary policies of the American government and its allies in Europe and Asia]]. [http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=116841 None other than Chuck Norris recommended the book to read], which skyrocketed Vox's ego into a place that satellites have not yet reached in the galaxy.

Aside from the hating, much of the feedback from what he does continues to be positive and so with each new day, Vox finds the urge to troll again.
