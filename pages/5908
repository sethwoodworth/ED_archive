'''[[OMG]][[WTF]][[Special:Random|OTL]]''' (''[[tl;dr|Odious Manly Genuflection With Terrible Fury: Only True Lamentation]]'', ''[[Japanese|Otoko Dogeza Jigoku]]'') is a visual novel by '''Hanpamania-Soft'''. It's known for high levels of [[awesome]] and manliness. The game doesn't have much of a [[Logic|plot]]; instead, it's a series of [[Family Guy|random encounters]]. As with other visual novels, this game is interactive and the Player has to choose which routes to take (meaning that you're going to press "QUIT" several times). Included within this little piece of [[insanity]] are [[South Park|Satanic bears]], [[tentacle monster]]s, and [[Weeaboo|inside jokes]].

==Dramatis Personae==
[[File:Hl crobar.jpg|thumb|Weapon needed for killing Satanic bears.]]
*'''The Player''' &ndash; [[You]].
*'''Osaka Bancho''' &ndash; [[Badass]] who wishes to rearrange your face.
*'''Karl Gotch''' &ndash; Greatest [[wrestler]] in existence ([[wikipedia:Karl Istaz|He was a real person, stupid]]).
*'''Yukana Aihara''' &ndash; [[Loli]] and love-interest.
*'''Kanagawa Bancho''' &ndash; [[George Lucas|Story-teller]].
*'''Gordon Freeman''' &ndash; [[Half-life|Yes, that Gordan Freeman]].
*'''Tsukkomi Bancho''' &ndash; Some random guy.
*'''Boke Bancho''' &ndash; The random guy's sidekick.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: Bancho means big bully or gang leader.

==Genuflect==
'''Genuflect''' (commonly '''[x] Genuflect''') is a [[chan]] meme that has its origins in OMGWTFOTL. In OMGWTFOTL, "Genuflect" is often an available choose. Genuflection is the act of dropping down on your knees and bowing before someone or something; thus, it's the equivalent of [[Superman|Kneel before Zod]]. The meme usually involves multiple choice in which one of the available options is ''[&nbsp;] Genuflect''. Alternatively, ''[&nbsp;] Genuflect'' may not be an available option, but you may answer with ''[x] Genuflect'' anyway. For example, when someone asks you for [[Tits or GTFO]], you may reply with the following:

<pre style="overflow:auto;">
[ ] Tits
[ ] GTFO
[x] Genuflect
</pre>

Nevertheless, don't expect the good ending when choosing to answer in such a way.
