'''WhiteMystery''' is a [[bisexual]] [[goth]] [[tranny]] [[the man|sysop]] [[love|carebear]] [[robot]] belonging to [[girlvinyl]] and possessing 500 e-monies on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Its main directive is to construct [[additional pylons]], and to replicate its genetic material &mdash; it comes as no surprise many have mistaken it for a [[human|human being]]. Also, WhiteMystery owns and assumably molests a [[cat]]. 

== About WhiteMystery ==
[[Last thursday]], WhiteMystery was seen quitting IRC [[WhiteMystery/QuitsIRCForever|forever]] after explaining to [[aempirei]] that he would never understand the special things that went on in [[ED IRC|#ed]]. WhiteMystery had threatened to [[ban|gline]] [[oclet]] for reasons [[Shit nobody cares about|unknown]], and [[hepkitten]] explained to him that he would never [[chat]] as hard as [[lusers|oldfags]] like her and oclet and that this was generally a poor thing to lack. Due to the [[Fellatio|Curse of WhiteMystery]], the #ed and the whole IRC network died only 30 minutes later. The manner in which this phenomenon occurred is still poorly understood. General consensus was that chatting is not a crime, and one bystander remarked that WhiteMystery should [[death|perish in a fire]]. Many were left asking, where is the [[lulz|lulz]]? Others decided they were now officially [[boring|bored]] to [[death]]. When [[ED]] comes out on DVD, we may find clues to what really went down. Because WhiteMystery is a [[What is a man?|goth tranny sysop carebear robot]] belonging to [[The Man|girlvinyl]] and possessing 500 [[gold|e-monies]], he is immune to any form of interference. An ability to gain favor with [[homosexual]]s is speculated to be key in his bid for power. Because [[lusers|no one among us]] can escape this, we can expect our [[Pants nazi|pants]] to continue being charmed off for years to come. You can detect WM's growing influence on [[ED]] by a trademark failed snarkiness and unneccessary usage of his sig within the bowels of the wiki. We're through the looking glass here, people.
