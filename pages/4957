One day, there was a picture of a cat. It was not [[Caturday]] but this specific [[cat]] was so long it became a [[meme]] and, though the day was not specifically the day of cats, this cat's length became famous. Originating from [[2ch]], it is a sacred meme that embodies the spirit of the [[lulz]], as it has touched the hearts of every [[anonymous|anon]] and [[/b/|/b/tard]] in the internets. All attempts made by [[Subeta|faggots who desire to]] [[Unwarranted self-importance|steal it from anon]] have earned the swift, unmerciful wrath of the [[Internet Hate Machine]]. 

Longcat is a real cat (obviously). For some reason when Longcat's uninspired owners named him, they must have overlooked the extremely fucking huge length of the kitten, and they named him after [[white| his second most defining feature]]. Therefore Longcat's real name is Shiroi (白い), which means "white" in Japanese.  This may, however, be an [[azn]] [[mindfuck|mind game]] to confuse [[black]] people who believe they are the longest [[penis|members]] of the human species.

== The legend ==

[[Noone]] knows how long Longcat actually is.  The figure above gives an estimated length of 10,000 ft, [[lie|however this number has been verified]] by [[science]].  The most successful space mission to measure Longcat had to turn back and [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|recharge their lasers]] after just [[over 9000 |9000 feet and one inch]] in the air.

===Possible Origin===
There is a quote by [[Einstein]] that may have been the source of inspiration for this meme:

{{quote|You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.|[[Albert Einstein]]}}

==The prophecy==
[[Image:Epic-LongBattle.jpg|thumb|It has been prophesied that during [[Catnarok]] Longcat will do epic battle with Tacgnol for the fate of the universe.]]
It is said that Longcat is part of a fursome of powerful cats that, when brought together, shall restore peace and harmony throughout the land.

{{quote|There shall be Four. One of Air, his fur white as snow. His power shall enlighten the masses, and herald the beginning. The second of Earth, black as the night. The darkness will be overwhelming, but do not fear! He has come as a harbinger of the goodness to come. The thrice appearance of a creature of great length, this one coloured as though wrapped in the very flame it represents, will appear to assuade our fears of the nigh end.Though it will be met with hate and loathing, it shall soldier on to aid us. The final, the fourth, shall emerge from the great oceans as though it was born of them, joining it's brothers and spreading harmony as it walks.

Together, the Four Felines will combine their great power, and summon a fifth, a creature of pure heart, radiant and beautiful. He, mighty and virile, will open the soul of all followers, and lead them to the land of ultimate delight. Never again will people have to buy dogs or get in their cars! No more will innocent yellow vans tremble at the approaching horde! The fruit of our reptilian labors will come, and feline power shall rule to cosmos!|[[Raptor Jesus]]}}

[[Image:More of Longcat!.jpg|thumb|The Longcat remix]]
Shortcat is closely related to Longcat, but what of his other family members?  Recently a DNA test confirmed that Longcat is blood-related to the bastardized [[:Image:Shatcat.jpg|Shatcat]]

It is also a [[Some argue|well known fact]] that [[Binkers]] is son of longcat.
