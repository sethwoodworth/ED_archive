'''Oklahoma''', also known as "The New Jersey of the Midwest," is a state located in the central [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|United States of America]] and was founded by a bunch of [[Christfags]] who were too dumb even for [[Texas]]. It was previously known as "Indian Territory", after Andrew Jackson marched every Indian in the east coast at gunpoint to Oklahoma with the promise of giving them their own land, only to absorb it about a century later. Oklahoma is also located in Dumbfuckistan, and Jesusland. White Oklahomans are renowned for their hatred of [[Negro]]es and Mexicans. The biggest tourist attraction in Oklahoma is the city of Tulsa. Tulsa is a popular destination, because, Tulsa, when spelled backwards is, "a sluT."  Oklahoma City, however, is infamous for its cheap and plentiful [[whore]]s. A bomb also went off there once, but no one cares anymore. The only contribution Oklahoma gives to human race is its effort to wipe out the population through the [http://normantranscript.com/government-beat/x96560292/In-35-city-study-Norman-s-water-tops-results-chart tap water].

==History==
Oklahoma's earliest history is shrouded in mystery. However it is believed to have originally been inhabited by [[furries|large talking bipedal iguanas]]. These [[Native American|natives]] evolved separately, but not unlike their counterparts in [[Africa]], the [[Negro]]es. These early natives are now known as Injuns (the casino kind, not the [[India|customer support kind]]). [[At least 100 years ago|At least 100 years ago]], the Injuns gave their land to the kind and gentle [[white people]]. This completely non-invasive action caused the savage Injuns the revolt against the nice white people. The Injuns [[Gullible|tricked]] the white people out of all their [[money]]. This ignited [[World War I]], which raged for many years and only ended [[last Thursday]]. A part of the truce allowed the savages to build casinos to steal money from [[redneck|the least intelligent of the white people]].

==Demographics==
The typical Oklahoma resident is a white male, about three hundred pounds who drives a Ford F-150 Extended Cab pickup loaded with [[Gun#M16|AR-15]]'s and wears flannel shirts and blue jeans all year round.  Let's not forget that a good portion of [[country music]] fags originated from Oklahoma, singing about [[Virgin|the ass they will never get]].  Most Oklahomans enjoy [[Masturbation|masturbating]] to ''Mein Kampf'', shooting niggers and faggots, and repeating whatever they hear from [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]], which is odd because most Oklahomans do not own [[television]]s or [[radio]]s.  [[Tea parties]] are a favorite activity in many areas of Oklahoma.  In said tea parties, crazy white guys protest taxes that they don't even pay and masturbate to the American flag. They also call [[Barack Obama]] such buzz words as '[[socialist]]'.

A rare breed of Oklahomans aren't [[retard]]ed, but are rarely seen due to all the [[fat]]asses getting in the way. This rare breed of Oklahomans tend to come either from Tulsa (a slut) or Oklahoma City (the city?). They typically end up going to OU in Norman, or to OSU in Stillwater with the rest of the hippies, and then once with a degree getting the hell out of Indian land. The leader of Oklahoma is Mistress Mary Fallin. Oklahoma stateswoman Sally Kern, Representative of the Oklahoma 84th District said that [[God Hates Fags|fags are the biggest threat Amerikkka]], "even more so than [[terrorism]] or [[Islam]]".  The richest man in Oklahoma is dumb-fuck Gary England, who reads the weather teleprompter and makes like $7 an hour.
