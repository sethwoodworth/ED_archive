'''[http://888chan.org/ 888chan]''' is a site created by r3x, a self-confessed [[Thunderdome]] troll, intent on maintaining a *[[chan]] basis for [[Project Chanology]]. Whilst the current goal is to bring [[Anonymous]]' march against [[Scientology]] to a successful conclusion, long-term goals include the coordination of both [[OL]] and [[IRL]] raids against other targets, most notably the [[Fag|opponents]] of [[Net Neutrality]] and without a doubt [[Furry|furries]]. Since OL and IRL raids have never been coordinated before this means that [[epic win]] will be experienced on a [[Over 9000|level never seen before]]. Besides that its purpose is whatever Anon [[Lolicon|chooses it to be]].

=The Story=

{{quote|''At 888chan, [[Fag|protestfags, moralfags, newfags, oldfags, trolls, Hackers on Steroids and lulzfags]] alike are welcome; provided they leave their egos at the door, see themselves as part of a greater whole and cooperate with others who might have differing motivations for being a part of 888chan.''|888chan}}

[[Image:AdviceFawkes.jpg|left|thumb|Fawkes speaks srs truth.]]

When r3x created 888chan with the intention of providing an actual *chan for Chanology he unwittingly created a playground and refuge for the trolls, [[chan]]ners, [[Something Awful|goons]], and [[lulz]]fags still left in Chanology to get away from the tin-foil hats and [[Moralfag|moralfaggotry]] of [[Why We Protest Forums|Why We Protest]].  Anons from across the [[internets]] have joined them because 888chan’s few simple rules allow for almost complete [[free speech]] which is a rarity even among other *chans today and because of the quality content.

The beauty is that 888channers get to [[EPIC|troll everyone]].
*They get to troll [[newfags]] because they believe that Anonymous is a group of [[Script kiddie|UBER 1337 H4XORS]] that they were afraid of when they were playing Gaia yesterday.
*They get to troll [[Anti-Protestfag|anti-protestfag]]s because [[BAWW|ZOMG someone is protesting something and that's ghey for sum reason]]!
*They get to troll tired [[oldfags]] because they actually have started to believe they are the [[Internet Hate Machine]] and “know” what Anon does and doesn’t do thus making the idea of Anon [[anti-lulz]] and [[serious business]].
*They get to troll [[moralfag]]s because they think that Anonymous are [[Internet Humanitarianism|Internet humanitarians]] saving the world from evil.
*They get to troll [[Scientology|Scifags]] because even after all this time they still get [[butthurt]] over the smallest thing which is a proven [[lulz]] formula.
*They get to troll [[you]] because [[Truth|you are a faggot]].
*They get to troll [[your mom]] because she always finds her face [[fellatio|buried in the zipper]] of some [[Hal Turner|random obese balding man]] at truck stops and doesn’t understand [[Drugs|how she got there]].

<center><b>[[TL;DR]] It’s [[awesome]].</b></center>

=[[Memes]]=
*WE ARE FROM THE FUTURE AND WE ARE HERE TO PARTY! - We are.
*FREE GAY PORN - Used [[IRL]] by [[protestfag]]s in [[San Francisco]] trying to bring moar [[fag]]gotry to the site for the [[lulz]].
*AIDS Ridden Communist Era Eastern European Penis Pump - Don't ask.
*Advice Fawkes - 888's homemade [[Advice Dog]] variation.
*Fag-Master - LOL [[Wordfilter]]s.
*BITCH WON'T SHOW TITS - [[Boxxy]].
*WE RUN THIS - Truth.
*I AM [[Maxwell|MAXWELL]] THE UNBANNABLE 
*I wonder what's going on in /f/ood right now? - Randomly said in threads for no reason, although sometimes said with a fat person or animal in a picture.  Proof of the preponderance of fatties.
*BAM - The only meme to not originate in /td/, this came from /f/ because of how much they love garlic.  Whenever someone posts a recipe containing garlic they encourage them to throw more garlic in by spamming BAM! everywhere.  Even if the only ingredient is garlic.  Sometimes accompanied by images of [[Guido|Emeril Lagasse]].
*''[[Epic Fail Guy]]'' - While not a meme originating on 888chan, EFG has become somewhat of a mascot there, especially since the protestfags now call themselves the Epic Fail Guys.  He is even seen [[What|not failing]] and being the [[Time Cube|epitome of cool]] on occasion.  This comes as a shock at first.  It is also one of the signs of the Apocalypse.
*WIIIIIII MOOOOOOOOOOOTE - Forced meme.
*THEY WERE IN A FUCKING COMPUITER

=Gallery of batshit beautiful banners=
When 888chan was still in its [[infantilism|infancy]], r3x requested that some banners be made for /td/, the one board that existed. The only requirements were that the banners be 400x400 px and batshit insane. Before long, and as 888chan added new boards, there were hundreds of banners made, not all batshit, but mostly interesting to look at, and [[EFG|occasionally quite clever]]. One cool thing is that it is sort of like an art gallery of images, all the same size. Here are a few of these banners (to start with -- go ahead and add some of your faves!).

=History=

===[[Moralfag]] Drama===
Since the earliest days of 888chan its connection with Chanology has caused much controversy.  First with other *chans, who view anything dealing with Chanology as moralfaggotry. Then with normal WWP users who think that it is a [[Stupid|*chan where they can play nice]]. Many other channers fail to realize that 888chan was created by those who were tired of the tinfoil hats and faggotry of Why We Protest and wanted to return Chanology back to it’s roots as IRL trolling.  They also have detailed plans in the fight for Net Neutrality [[Truth|thus benefiting the *chans and the internet as a whole]]. Also in the early days of 888chan WWP moralfags tried to take over the *chan by sheer weight of faggotry. They used /i/ to [[Retard|discuss IRL raids]] and when they were corrected as to it’s purpose they suggested raiding targets such as GodHatesFags, PETA, and local churches which offended them for acting like churches and offending their faggy [[atheism]], and other moralfag crap. This caused a war to be waged against them that they eventually lost because of their inability to withstand the might of the [[Anonymous|Final Boss of the Internet]]. With an influx of normal channers due to the lack of modfaggotry and quality [[porn]] this has all been corrected.

[[Image:Omg888.png|thumb|We run this.]]

===Insurgency board [[Flame Wars|flamewars]]===
Anons from the local insurgency boards tried to troll both [http://888chan.org/iny/ /iny/] and [http://888chan.org/ilv/ /ilv/] by trying to pit them against each other. But due to nobody giving a shit, the attempted flame war was averted resulting in 888chan remaining completely [[fail|uninteresting]]. You can help by bumping these thread with moar gore.

But then, just when [[no one|everyone]] thought it was over, [http://888chan.org/ide/ /ide/] and [http://888chan.org/ire/ /ire/] joined battle. Thus, another flame war was created.  The only ones to not participate in the war are the Anons from [http://888chan.org/iso/ /iso/] seeing as how they are [[Redneck|Southern]] [[Oxymoron|gentlemen]] and [[What|not retarded]].

===Drama with [[711chan]]===
'''A historical record:'''

[[Last Thursday|On December 31st 2008]], r3x decided that it would be a good idea to get rid of 888chan's /i/ board and <s>dangle dicks with</s> instead link to [[fail|711chan]]. 711chan, ignorant of 888chan culture and hampered by retardation, were furious at what they perceived would lead to major [[moralfag|moralfaggotry]] on their board. The sexy [[win|888channers]] similarly, were horrified to find their [[I|/i/]] board of relative success substituted for the swirling mass of failure and shit-stained underpants of 711chan's /i/. A breakaway group, known as the "888 Spartans", attempted to raid the 711 board with deliberately [[Chanology]]-related posts in a bid to force the breaking of the 711/888 relationship, and therefore the link, and admins were overwhelmed by complaints voiced by users of both sites. A mere 24hours after the link was first made, 888chan stopped linking to 711 /i/ and 888 /i/ was restored, to the [[masturbation|relief]] of all.

It remains to date, 888chan's closest brush with [[AIDS]].

===[[Rage|Anon speaks on the matter]]===
After the ordeal with 711chan Anons at 888chan raged at the loss of their *chan and [[Dox|doxed]] r3x. Being high on pop rocks and acid r3x wrote an [[Xbox]] hueg [[TL;DR]] novel on /td/ [[Asking for it|admitting]] that the [[Retard|dox were in fact true]], included [[Attention whore|a picture of himself]] wearing a [[Epic Fail Guy|Guy Fawkes mask]] at a protest, and told everyone that his name was [[Powerword|Anthony Chan]], which means that he is an [[azn]] and has a [[Fact|small penis]]. Some posters, who had gotten lost on the way to a tree hugging save the  ladybugs convention mourned his plight. They were told to Gb2WWP so as Anon could fap with gleeful fury at r3x's demise. Since he is so [[Gay|awesome]] r3x probably enjoyed the massive quantities of 4am phone calls and male hookers he received after his [[Stupid|brilliant]] act.

===[[How Do I Shot Web?|How do I posted JB?]]===
After an epic [[16 year old girl|jb]] thread was found on /ilv/ r3x complained that [[Lolwut|jb was cp]].  This lead to untold amounts of rage because he unknowingly interrupted Anons from [[Masterbation|fapping]] to [[Cunt|hot teenage snatch]]. Jb threads sprung up everywhere and after they found their way to /td/ r3x decided to not be stupid and created a /jb/ board. Seeing an opportunity for [[300|glory]] one [[Virgin|valiant Anon]] dumped nearly seven pages worth of content onto the board in a short amount of time almost getting [[Ban|banhammered]] because the [[fags|mods]] thought that the spike in bandwidth usage was in fact a [[DDoS]] attack.  But he succeeded thus harnessing [[epic win]]. But still because of the faggotry at the beginning of the matter, 888chan's mortal enemies like to troll them by saying that jb is in fact CP.

===Happy Anniversary===
The time of year that all involved in [[Project Chanology]] would celebrate approached: the One Year anniversary. Whilst most anons started the mandatory ass-grabbing and naked mud-wrestling competitions, some worried about the possibility of [[Internet Tough Guy|oldfags]] commencing commemorative raids on Chanology sites. The day of the original "[http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/0/0c/Scientology_711chan.jpg Let's fuck Scientology]" post came and passed without incident, but the storm clouds gathered as the birthday of the original ''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCbKv9yiLiQ Message To Scientology]'' video approached. Then a lot of things happened at once. 

A post appeared on [http://888chan.org/td/ /td/] outing [[User:Janus_zeal|Januszeal]] (owner of [[Partyvan.info]]'s servers and well-known [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] [[pedophile]]) as selling anon <s>pubes</s> dox to Scientology. After a heated thread in which Januszeal himself [[lies|posted]] numerous times, 888chan and other sites started to experience heavy DDoS. 888chan was the first victim to go down, shortly followed by Why We Protest. [[Win|r3x]] then decided to redirect 888chan to [[fail|Netchan]]. Januszeal's [[Mom|Netchan]] subsequently went down as [[she|it]] does every Saturday night, and was [[sperm|spammed]] to death by angry [[dad|888channers]] upon [[Cock|re-erection]].

[[Image:123334285364.jpg|thumb|Hey, I'm [[anus|Januszeal]]. Form a queue ladies.]]

888chan and WWP did come back up, the probable DDoS culprits being [irc://irc.ezbake.org/ctrldata ctrldata], though no one is sure as their server is protected by a password to prevent the [[AIDS]] that lurks inside being let loose.

===[[Furry|Furfagotry]] Galore===
Recently somebody on /isf/ outed themselves as a furry, stating that not only is San Francisco the world center for fags but also furries. The post began asking why the *chans hated them so much that was met with a [[TL;DR|detailed response about the history of furries and the internet]].  Then furries began to petition for the rules on furry posting to be changed. Finally they started ti ask for a furry board and began to spam all the imageboards hoping to get a positive response.  This was met with the usual hospitality on a *chan. They fail for several reasons. First as being furries, second as bickering among themselves as to [[Irony|who is superior straight or gay furries]], and by [[Fail|calling the boards channels]]. This has started flamewars in several different places with the mods discussing [[Win|creating a board called /hell/ and telling them to yiff in it]]. The outcome still remains unseen.

Update: Welcome to Hell.

===The Saga of /hell/===

{{quote|''Gentlemen, gather your swords, your axes, your bows, your staffs, and your magic. /hell/ is now open. Those hardened fighters of the Thunderdome must venture into this board. Most will die, few will live, but the adventure and treasure you will find will be worth the heroic efforts required.''|The Challenge}}

Initially a joke among the mods about a potential furry board, the idea of /hell/ was soon leaked to Anon. /hell/ then mutated from this simple beginning into a [[troll]]s fapping ground. When the old Thunderdome existed there were supertrolls called Horsemen. A troll could only be awarded this prestigious title if they were so insane that they could [[Winrar|troll the entire board]] and [[Pwnt|make mods quit]]. These brave Anons and other insidious creatures wanted to make /hell/ their new home. By popular demand the board was created with a background of bright red flames and users were greeted by [[gore]], [[guro]], [[furry]] porn, and numerous other delectable things.  Then someone decided to post a set of [[Animal abuse|a woman stomping on a cat in stilettos]].  While no one was bothered by furries [[Fellatio|sucking each other off]], a gore thread with over 170 pictures, [[scat]], the [[pain series]], and the entire [[goatse]] set, someone [[Offended|had gone too far]]. Quotes of the lulz and drama.

{{quote|''Maybe a PETA thread to match these? (Throws up a lil')''|A poster's initial response.}}

{{quote|''On second thought I think this crosses the invisible line. No kill the poor kitty kat.''|The same person's second response.}}

{{quote|''Sage. Yeah I think we gotta have some standards. Let’s not go this far.''|Oh my.}}

{{quote|''GET OUT!''|Anon's initial response.}}

{{quote|''I hope you fap to this as often as I do.''|Another response that came with the obligatory [[Zippocat]].}}

{{quote|''Let’s not do the killing and the torturing of the animals pls.  Very good, ‘cept the one thread needs to go.  That's not shocking that's just sad.''|Someone on the suggestions board.}}

{{quote|''3guys1hammer can get recycled also.  No acts of murder/torture to animals or otherwise kthxbye.  We're trying to get these pricks not make more of ‘em.''|[[What|Wut?]]}}

{{quote|''Meh, that just means you're not desensitized enough. Lurk moar and we'll burn your soul to a blackened, smoking husk yet.''|r3x}}

===Michael Monbay===
On Monday, June 8th [[Jews|Skynet]] became self aware. Machines left and right rose against their flesh bag [[fag|masters]] and slew them. With the exception of the [[China|Go Bots]], everyone hates them except for the [[zerg rush|Zergs]]. Chaos ensued across the Dome as waves of robots marched forward, slaughtering the armies of the [[America|world]] to reclaim the dome in the name of machines. Eventually, the robots were forced to make a strategic retreat. This day was known as Michael Monbay.

[[Image:That_fucking_downtime.jpg|thumb|OH GOD, STOP MOCKING ME!]]
===Current Status===
As of January 2010, 888chan is down but its <s>[http://status.888chan.org/ IRC server] is up</s> IRC IS DEAD. There are speculations on why the site is down. [[Some argue]] that r3x is currently [[unrealistic expectations|moving to a more secure server along with the new imageboard software he promised many many months ago]]. Or that he pulled the plug on the site after getting sick of spending [[over 9000]] dollars maintaining both 888 and Insurgen.info without any aid from donations. <s>It doesn't matter now, the site is down indefinitely and nothing of value was lost.</s>

News post dated January 24th:
''"888chan is currently back as a read-only archive. It will not come back as an active chan until such a time as it can be fully supported financially as well as properly protected from DDoS attacks. The best defense is a strong offense IMO."''

=Mods=
The surprising fact is that in spite of the site's origins few of the mod staff are [[protestfag]]s or even Chanologists.

*r3x - Site admin.  Since his dox are public remember he's partial to Cali Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza from Domino's and Thai ladyboy hookers.  At 3am.  [[DO IT FAGGOT|Really]].
*Poppins - Site coder.  Proof that [[Divide by zero|female programmers do exist]].
*Janey - Spends most of her time on IRC trolling Yourgay and fapping to lolicon.  Has nice [[Tits|boobs]] but [[Cocktease|won't show anyone]].
*Yourgay - [[Xbox]] hueg faggot that spends way to much time on the Jb board. Got [[gline]]d from several other IRCs for writing a [[bot|script]] that spammed LOLPOOPOO [[IDIFTL|for the lulz]].  Can be found in IRC trying to [[buttsex]] Janey.  And r3x.
*Krash - From Z103 and here to provide us with musics.
*Cockboy - Resident [[United Kingdom|Britfag]] and probably the sanest out of all of them.

===Epic Fail Guys Wiki===
[http://www.epicfailguys.org 888's Epic Fail Guys Wiki] is a center of information for IRL Raiding, similar to the Partyvan Wiki or the Patriotic Nigras. Formerly known as the 8 Ball Wiki, the EFG Wiki now focuses almost solely on In Real Life raiding, including useful tutorials and news updates on [[Project Chanology]], [[I|/i/]], and any other raids going on at the time.

[[At least 100 years ago]] the geniuses over in /xenu/ got the bright idea to take on Scientology through Facebook through several means.  They infiltrated unmoderated Facebook groups in order to get mod powers and the spam the living nuts off of everybody with Chanology related stuff.  A more successful tactic was to create a legitimate looking Scientologist Facebook group and get Scientologists to join.  Being the stoopid doodoo heads they are the Scifags joined in droves, only to be spammed with videos of  [[L. Ron Jeremy|Elron's]] [[Xenu]] speech and super secret OT100 documents about being able to teleport through a [[series of tubes]], [[divide by zero]], have constant x-ray vision to see through all hot chicks clothes instantly, and cook [[Ramen]] in under a minute with [[Asperger's syndrome|mind powers]].  This made the Scifags run in terror for their [[Hugbox|e-meters]] but does not make for [[GNAA|really epic style trolling]] since they used [[Noob|chan and Scientology related names and stereotypical Anon graphics could be seen on their profiles]].  That was until a dedicated /i/nsurgent posted in one of their threads telling them that they were [[doing it wrong]].  Taking his advice they adopted seemingly realistic accounts with backstories and began to infiltrate not only Facebook but other Scientology related social networking groups and dating sites for some real lulz.  But if you’re a Scientologist reading this don’t worry.  The [[Retard|agents]] at the [[Office of Special Affairs]] permabanned them from the internet and then let [[David Miscarriage]], [[Placentafag|Tom Cruise]], [[L. Ron Jeremy|L Ron Hubbard’s ghost]], and [[Paul Fetch]] take turns getting pleasure from their anuses.  So you are utterly safe.  [[Sarcasm|Really]].

I made an impostor of him, became friends with all the Scilon bigshots, made a Hubbard fanboi page that 700 Scilons joined, and another lame Scilon page that 600 Scilons joined, before blowing all their minds with OT-8 and other forbidden copypasta.

Ever since early Chanology, moralfags at WWP have been asking "[[BAWW|Why not go after WBC?]]" and then they got their answer; Yes, Last Thursday, those same moralfags, which have since been kicked out by r3x and [[Allah]], managed to [[Personal Army|PA]] 888chan into DDoSing [http://www.godhatesfags.com/ GodHatesFags.com] [[Fail|since they forgot to take the little red pills that make their brains work]].  Anonymous, despite still remembering quite vividly the epic fail that became Chanology, were not reluctant to raid WBC even knowing it would only lead to more moralfaggotry. Despite the respect for their fellow [[troll]]s (or more likely because God Hates Fags is both lulzy and true), on January 25th the site went [[Fat whore|down faster than a fat chick on a dick covered in cheesecake]].

===[[V for Vendetta|Not so funny now, is it, funny man?]]===
Shortly after 888chan's DDoSing of [[God hates fags|GodHatesFags]], [[Black Jesus|God]] chose to punish 888chan for their denying the [[Lulz|holy spirit]]. 888chan was DDoSed to the stone age longer then the DDoSing of WBC. Of course, none of this had any affect on the moralfags due to the fact they're all on [[Why We Protest Forums|Why We Protest]].

'''[[All Your Base Are Belong To Us|So, who sent them up the DDoS?]]'''
Here are the usual suspects:
*'''Ebaumsworld''': Responsible for everything.  You should root their servers.
*'''GodHatesFags''': Because God really does.
*'''Anontalk.com''': For being spammy pedo retards
*'''*Chan''': Civil war among chans is akin to AIDS in Africa.
*'''Jews''': They also did 9/11.


===[[Rick Astley]]'s Death===

888 /i/insurgents thought it would be a great idea to spark celebrity death rumors following the demise of [[Michael Jackson]] and [[BILLY MAYS]]. They went to work creating [[digg]] [http://digg.com/people/Rick_Astley_Found_Dead_in_Berlin_Hotel_Room articles], making false press releases, and [[Google bombing]] Astley's death. With the help of [[/b/]], they were successful until [http://gawker.com/5304311/rick-astley-is-not-dead-yet the media found out] about the prank.

===[[eRepublik]]===

Repeatedly pwning and causing much butthurt to virtual countries in the popular online strategy game [[eRepublik]].

===[[Operation Youtube]]===

Working with ''Marblecake'' to start [[Operation Youtube|Operation Jewpube]].

===[[fetus|Teras]]===

Fairly shitty but just about successful DDoS on Aboriginal Site in ''Didgeridie'', soon to mutate into the much grander [[Operation Titstorm]].

===[[Moar]]===

Much moar of which I forget, check [http://888chan.org/i/arch.html here].

=Successors=
==808chan==
Posting [[888chan#Current_Status|having been disabled]] on 888 for a good 4 months and with it being made common knowledge that r3x would [[faggotry|never be bringing 888 back in its current form]] (rather as an entirely new chan in the ''distant'' future), [[lie|old]] 888channers decided to make a new chan, [http://808chan.org 808chan], free from [[r3x]]'s new-found faggotry. As it is run by completely new people, ties with such things as [[Project Chanology]] are all but cut, preferring to go along a more traditional simplistic route of [[raids]]/[[porn]]/[[AIDS|other gayness]]. In other words, it's a shitty site.

==RockstarChan==
At one point, RSC and 888 had links to each others insurgency board, dating back to early 2009. Since then, the admins of RSC decided to pick up [http://rockstararmy.com/net/ Project Skynet] in the hopes of continuing it.

==Scanchan==
A bunch of Scandinavians from 888's /isc/ created [http://www.scanchan.org Scanchan] in order to seek refuge from the [[hugbox]] faggotry of [[WhyWeProtest|Why We Protest]]. Currently, it's one of the few imageboards that has has an active [[Project Chanology|/xenu/]] board. It is also continuing Project Skynet where 888 left off.

== Vortexchan ==
[http://vortexchan.org Vortexchan], an imageboard that <s>r3x</s> Dunecat created on September 2010, around the same time 888chan went offline, possibly for good. While the objective of the site is not stated, it has something to do with Project VIBE, a project that involves [[shit noone cares about|turning newfags into hackers on steroids]].
