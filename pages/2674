[http://www.entervoid.com Entervoid] is a piece of [[shit]] place. The web site has retarded rules involving your imaginary [[furry]] characters fighting to the death.

== Rules ==
Galvo, the creator of Entervoid, created three simple rules:
# Use a normal hat.
# Put 20 tickets in the hat. Ten say "good" and ten say "bad".
# The [[admin]]s pull out ten tickets to decide whether each artist is allowed to play.

Everyone on Entervoid has to do Galvo [[in the ass]] because he is the owner and the ''wise old man'' among the [[retard]]ed voidlings who are clueless and dont understand how things work in the "TRUE REAL WORLD".  Galvo is like [[Adolf Hitler]] but more fucking stupid than a fucking rock. Galvo is also a [[DeviantArt]] whore.

Whenever Galvo gets bored out of his skull on the magical [[Internets]], he goes on the 'Void's [[forum]]s. He then makes fun of everyone's rejected art because he has no life and has nothing else to do other than [[masturbate]] to [[bestiality|animal]] [[porn]].
