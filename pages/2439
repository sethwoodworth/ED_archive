[[Image:Furryscenester.jpg|thumb|right|Your average run-of-the-mill [[furry]] drama whore.]]A '''drama whore''' is someone who lives for [[drama]]. This person will usually claim he or she does not like the drama, but secretly they are always happier when it is around. A perfect example of such drama whores is Yahoo!'s own [[Drama queen|drama queen]], [[Dayna|Dayna]].
Being a drama whore is not necessarily a bad thing, and to be called one is only considered insulting if intended as such. Indeed, many drama whores proudly wear the term as a "badge of honor," thus stripping it of any negative connotation. 

The entire staff of [[LJDrama]], for example, are considered drama whores, as are that site's regular visitors. Individuals who watch soap operas and shows such as ''The O.C.'' and ''Sex in the City'' are also drama whores. 

Some communities attract their own discipline specific drama whores. One such community (where [[your mom]] might go drama whoring) is [http://www.livejournal.com/community/crochet/ the LiveJournal crochet community]. It features frequent dramatic episodes relating to matters such as pattern copyright, whether it's mean to be mean to [[people]] in a friendly supportive community, whether your yarn and/or pattern is ugly and sucks and [http://www.livejournal.com/community/crochet/2576978.html?thread=23556946#t23556946 whether some contributing user is a troll or not].  

Drama Whores exist in every clique that exists. The most amusing are [[Emo]] drama whores (yes they exist, as a matter of fact they are what populates the entire subculture) and [[Furry]] Drama whores.

In the middle of 2008, a new idea began to emerge that not all drama whores are intentionally causing drama, but are instead regular people who are fun to gang up on for having a different view point or belief than the rest of the pack.  In this case they are lightening rods for drama instead of purposeful drama whores.
