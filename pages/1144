|One of Brandon's many [[Derp|thought-provoking]] statements.}}

'''brandonkeys''' (aka Brandon Michael Keys, brandonkeys@live.com, and Bran Donkeys) is a [[batshit insane]] [[drama queen]] and member of the [http://www.indigosociety.com Indigo Society], a forum where [[Indigo Children]] and other [[Asperger's|special people]] hang out and try to convince each other that they're really speshul souls incarnated on Earth to save the world.

==All about Brandon Keys/Bran Donkeys==

[[Image:David_Icke.jpg|thumb|[[David Icke]], whom Brandon [[faps]] to on a regular basis.]]

Since brandonkeys apparently forgot where the spacebar was when registering his username, there is some debate on the forum as to whether his name should be read as "brandon keys" or "[[shit|bran donkeys]]".

This [[luser|fine chap]] has a very colorful history. He has declared [[war]] on the [[Illuminati]], the [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy|Masons]], and the [[reptoids|reptilians]]. He has also declared himself to be the reincarnation of [[Harry Potter|Merlin]], Thor, and Zeus, and that he will personally stop [[Yahweh]]. He's so [[insane]], even the other members think he's loony. His posts usually comprise of incoherent ramblings in big, bold, italic letters, illustrated with pretty pictures and clips from [[Stargate|popular]] [[Star Trek|science-fiction]] [[Doctor Who|shows]]. He doesn't seem to know the difference between "ancient" and "medieval", as demonstrated [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?20911-Ancient-Medieval-Music-and-Songs-Of-Ancient-Medieval-Europe here], and once mistook a forum upgrade for a [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?21520-Look-Who-Ever-The-Bloody-Hell-Your-Are-I-Order-You-To-Stop-With-These-Attacks-Now!!!! hacking]. He's angry at the Founding Fathers for [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?21205-I-Hate-George-Washington-Benjamin-Franklin-Thomas-Jefferson-Alexander-Hamilton-Etc not losing the war with the British], because it's all their fault his ancestors came to America and robbed him of his [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|rightful lordship]]. In August of 2009, Brandon [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?21164-I-Have-Just-Become-A-Vegetarian became a vegetarian] and declared his intention to join [[PETA]], apparently failing to realize that its founder is also an evil reptilian who wants to rule the world.

Despite PETA's [[lies|promises]] that going vegetarian will make you a more peaceful and compassionate individual, he shortly thereafter wrote a rageful post in which he declared that everyone else on the forum were bigots, racists, socialists, fascists, communists, and [[Godwin's Law|neo-Nazis]]. Other members were not amused by his antics. Just a few days later, he started another thread asking if there were others with "compassion and acceptance in their hearts." Sure there are, Brandon, but you're just not one of them.

[[Image:brandonkeys child.jpg|thumb|Brandon as a child. The [[douchebag]] is so [[attention whore|vain]], he used an [[shooped|online image editor]] to give himself an aura.]]

Later, he whined about how he felt like [[Wesley Crusher]] and the rest of the forum was the ''Enterprise'', who always put poor little Wesley down because of his age. For once, Brendan was half-right. He is comparable to Wesley Crusher, [[Annoying|just not for the reasons he imagined]]. He also declared his intent to build a utopia for [[jerk|nice]] [[white people]] [[racist|only]], another move which other members did not find amusing. He also put his sexuality into question by starting a thread titled "[http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?23768-Love-Each-Other-Please-*Wink-%29-Wink-%29* Love Each Other Please *Wink ;) Wink ;)*]". He shortly thereafter revealed just how [[Attention Whore|vain]] he was by starting a thread listing famous Brandons in history (read: contemporary actors and athletes).

Just to prove again how much of a whiny bitch he is, Brandon started a thread to whine about the moderators violating his right to free speech, which also proved his ignorance as [[Shit Nobody Cares About|the Constitution applies to the government, not citizens and messageboards]]. Later, he [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?24065-*Roar*-*Roar*-*Roar* started a thread] to rant about how [[butthurt|VARY VARY ANGERY]] he was because [[Attention Whore|nobody was paying attention]] to one of his [[Over 9000|five zillion]] [[WHARRGARBL|lengthy and eloquent]] threads.

When ABC's new ''V'' series was announced, he started a thread in which he announced that the series proved that [[David Icke]] was right all along, which is a [[Batshit Insane|perfectly logical conclusion]]. He has also pledged his allegiance to a [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?23289-My-Pledge-Allegiance-To-quot-Atlantis-quot-Under-One-Nation-On-quot-Earth-quot hotel]. On October 30th, 2009, Brandon apparently had a very brief moment of sanity and posted a thread which [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?24304-The-Gibberish-Sounds-Like-Speech-But-Carries-No-Actual-Meaning-Thread accurately summed up every other thread he had posted before].

Brandon announced that he was actually originally from the [[horny|Pegasus]] Galaxy. The fact that a forum full of [[Indigo Children]] and people whose ancestors are [[catgirl|cat-like aliens]] recognized his insanity right away should tell you something.

On November 3rd, Brandon [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?24507-I-Don-t-Know-Whether-To-Commit-Suicide-Or-%28-quot-Not-quot-%29.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! threatened] to [[suicide|kill himself]] because [[emo|nobody listened to him]]. Unfortunately, the other members talked him out of it. On the same day, he declared his intent to leave the forum for a week, then returned the very next day because his [[Schizophrenia|spirit guides]] told him to.

On the 10th, Brandon [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?24845-I-Am-Merlin-The-Wizard-Who-Is-From-The-City-of-%28-quot-Avalon-Atlantis-quot-%29-Who-Is-A declared] that he was "Commander Merlin", who had "[[Hadouken|great and powerfull powers]]". Cue [[facepalm]].

In late January of '10, Brandon apparently decided that the only way to counter the Indigo Society's horrid censorship and get people to listen to him was to [http://the21stcentury2025future.freeforums.org start his own forum]. He committed every mistake a thirteen-year-old or sixteen-year-old makes when making their own forum; specifically, making sub-forums for [[Shit Nobody Cares About|every potential interest]] he could imagine and using [[ugly]] animated GIFs that didn't even match. The lack of posts suggests that his brilliant plan has [[fail|not gone as intended]].

Recently, Brandon announced that he sleeps with "[http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?33214-Sleep-With-Two-Lemurian-Seed-Crystals-At-Night-Every-Night..................!!!!!!!! Lemurian seed crystals]", which bear a striking resemblance to ancient Atlantean [[dildos]].  

He also believes that people [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?23362-People-Are-Going-To-Be-Talking-About-Me-1000-Years-From-Now.!!!! will be talking about him 1,000 years from now], but [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?33832-Do-You-Know-That-I-Get-Ingored-Alot-By-Alot-of-People-On-quot-Indigo-Society-quot-....!!!! can't figure out why so many people have him on their "Ignore" list]. 

It turns out that repeated questioning of Brandon's ramblings will cause him to break out in a rash of [[WHARRGARBL|scripture]] now [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?33832-Do-You-Know-That-I-Get-Ingored-Alot-By-Alot-of-People-On-quot-Indigo-Society-quot-....!!!!/page4], despite claiming earlier that all religions (including Christianity) were created by [[evil]] [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] [[Jews]].

===Brandon Discovers This Page!===
A member of the Indigo Society discovered Brandon's ED page and posted a link for all to see. It was super effective!

A short while after discovering that some people did not worship the ground he walked on, Brandon announced that he was leaving the Indigo Society.  He later returned with his usual drama-generating tricks, but instead of RUNING FOR PRESIDENT he now BELIEVES IN GUN RIGHTS.! and has Fox News's logo as his avatar.  [http://indigosociety.com/showthread.php?36839-A-Call-To-Action-To-All-True-Patriots.................!!!!!!!!!!!!!&highlight=spirit+guide he has announced] that he is against homosexual marriage and faps to Fox News on a nightly basis.
