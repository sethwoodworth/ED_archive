Meet the only race [[Divide by 0|that can out-Jew]] a Jew.

'''China''', known to many of its inhabitants as the [[hubris|center of the world]] [[shit nobody cares about|(in Chinese, China is 中国 [zhongguo] which literally means "center country")]], is a giant industrial park in [[Asia]]. It has [[OVER 9000|so many people]] that they've instituted a [[Dead babies|One-child policy]]. One of Amurka's [[Walmart|largest trading partners]], China has been known to export [[Lulz|defective and dangerous products]], an unfortunate result of their religious adherence to their retarded [[Capitalism|"manufacture uber-cheap, sell uber-cheap, FUCK EVERYTHING ELSE, CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP"]] universal manufacturing standards that the US still loves to buy. 

It is also very important to note that the [[moonspeak|Engrish]] manuals that Chinese products come with are, for the most part, examples of the greatest heights of Engrish grammar and prose. They're so great, in fact, most people would feel their head aching on reading the first few lines, while others feel a sudden urge to hurt someone. Also, [[some argue]] that the Chinese are [[Lolwut|inscrutable]]. [[Eurofags|Others]] would say [[Americunts]] are shitting their pants when hearing of the country.

One may refer to the people of China by many names, including:

* Pre-viral lifeform
* [[Oriental]]
* Chinaman
* Chiggers (China + black person)
* Chink
* Chiamese
* Chine
* Ching Chong
* [[Taiwan]]ese
* [[Asia|Gooks]]
* Jackie Chan (Fact: Every Chinaman is Jackie Chan or an impersonator of him.)
* The Jews of Asia
* The country that buttraped the US economy without lube

==Chinese People==

[[Image:Chn.jpg|thumb|The day CHINA GOT BITCH SLAPPED BY THE WHOLE WORLD! England, Germany, Russia, France, and Japan humbled arrogant China for the lulz! If china continues bitching like a slut in heat it'll be gang-raped again!]]

[[image:domathfast.jpg|thumb|A typical Chinese [[math]] plantation.]]

[[image:Kinkajou_Chinkajou.jpg|thumb|There IS a difference.]]

Many have pondered the [[Sex|reason for China's incredible population size]], only to be baffled by the obvious [[ugly|ugliness]] of the [[women]]. The [[UK|United Kingdom's]] greatest [[philosopher]], Prince Philip, declared Chinese women to be the "[[Fugly|ugliest in the world]]". Out of all types of [[azn]], chinks are by far the ugliest. Only 1 person out of every 1,000 people born of the abominable Chinese race is worth looking at.

The Chinese population has more than doubled, from 563 million in 1950 to over 1.3 billion in 2005. This makes the Communist Party's Republic of China severely overpopulated. As such, the Chinese Communist Party has mastered the art of sacrificing Chinese people with campaigns like the Great Leap Forward (1959–1961),[[I did it for the lulz|which killed 30-40 million people, and the Cultural Revolution
(1966–1976) with 7–8 million casualties.]]

The Han Chinese are proud of their ancient heritage of being ruled over by foreigners during non-Chinese dynasties like Tang (ethnically mixed), Yuan (Mongol), Qing (Manchu), with the addition of European and Japanese powers (19th and 20th century).  

Despite the big cultural and linguistic diversity in China, they try to maintain the homogeneous population myth, and [[Liberal|lay claim to lands that historically never belonged to China proper (e.g. Taiwan)]].

Much like niggers with their basketball, spics with their menial labor and whites with their faggotry, chiggers (aka Rice Niggers) have their own special array of talents. At a young age, many boys are forced to engage in a life of studying the Confucian rites and being able to apply all that bullshit to the math and physics they're forced to cram for on a study night. 

China actually had a interesting culture 100 years ago. But like everything else, Japanese culture invaded and now Chinese also have to display the peace sign in every photograph they take. Nowadays, Chinese people copy from American,European and Japanese culture. China [[b/|no longer displays original content]].

The Chinese countryside is dotted with sweatshops full of [[loli|child laborers]]. It is said that the sound of their shoemaking can be heard from Mars. However, the years of labor they endure is all worth it, as on payday they are each given a small sum of sand and a handful of dog hairs.

Exactly 100% of Chinamen spend most of their lives as slaves in math plantations.

*To be honest and frank, have you ever met a worthy Chinaman? Hmm? No? Didn't think so...

===National Anthem===

I gotta go slash up some toddlers now, haven't got time for noodles nor rice

I'm on my way to slash some kiddies now, diapers covered in blood are so nice!

Hacking at those little babies, makes me feel so strong

Ain't enough bitches to make us chinks hubbies, so killing kiddies makes my dick get long!

Slashing the babies, slashing the babies, won't you come slashing some babies with me?!

Can you pass my an empty water bottle, 'cause I really need to pee...

Lead in children's toy, me really, really likey

Just because we are Chinese, don't make us the Asian Kikey!

What was that noise, was it me pooping in hole?

Or was it just me, spitting in your soup bowl?

Our country is filled with copped trees, polluted rivers, and irradiated rocks

We are known in Asian as a giant cat box

=== 2008 Beijing Orimpics ===

<i>Main article: [[LOLympic Games]]</i><br>

[[Image:OrympicShoopSinger.jpg|thumb|China's amazing Shoop-da-Mexican, used to make Mexicans from nothing. [[Pedobear|PEDOBEAR]] APPROVES.]]

[[Image:Happy Happy Happy.jpg|thumb|A typical slave to the Dalai Lama.]]

[[Image:TeamBWWOOOOONG.jpg|thumb|Team China has their eyes on the ball...and the gold.]]

Beijing was fortunate enough to <strike>win</strike> purchase the bid for the 2008 Orimpic Games, and they have delivered on a promise to give the world an amazing competition.

The August 8th Opening Ceremony of the Orimpics started off with a bang. The nation that invented fireworks gave the world the most impressive display of photoshopped fireworks ever seen. The fun did not stop there; after ¥1 Billion Renminbi and years of hard work, Chinese computer engineers managed to create a program able to shoop an attractive child over an [[ugly]] child with talent.

As the Orimpics got underway, Team China dominated the in the child labor competition, winning the gold with two of the youngest loli to have ever competed. It wasn’t long before everyone was asking how China managed to train some of the best underage athletes in the world. The Chinese reveled their forced labor training camps where loli are selected at the tender age of 3 for rigorous training in making high quality Nikes and lead-covered sports equipment for other teams. (Team Wal-Mart was disappointed in the Chinese decision to reveal secret training exercises.)

While performing well in the child labor competition, the U.S.of fucking A. try-hard "Redeem "Shitfaced" Team" has hurt China's chances of earning the gold in the Orimpic Basketball Tournament. However, hopes still ride on Yao Ming to bring home a metal. The Chinese state-sponsored coaching staff hopes by training Ming into the ground and destroying his career as a basketball player, they will be victorious in earning the gold for Team China. In a statement to the press Ming said, "If I don' bring home the gorrd they wirr kirr my famiry and reprace me wit any one of severar mirrions erigibre Chinese basketba' praya." You can bet that Ming's famiry will be cheering for him during the games.

China did however excel in spitting, bottle peeing, and shitting in holes. Unfortunately, none of these activities are recognized Olympic events. Regardless, the Chinese moved forward, with each day in the events producing more spit, urine and feces than one could ever have possibly imagined. These events climaxed with the closing ceremonies, where Chinese performers ended the games with a series of enormous bowl movements, the drowning of several Chinese "dissidents" in a spit / urine pool, and a secondary invasion of Taiwan.

The Chinese government broadcast the events on live TV, then quickly denied the incident ever occurred, right after calling Google to ask for another "favor".

===Things They Don't Want You to Know===
* Fact: China's National Motto? China: The Land Of Spit And Tobacco.
* Fact: Chinese city workers can't dig up roads to repair pipe systems as the natural instinct for a Chinese person when they see an open hole in the ground is to shit in it. It is estimated that the Chinese population could fill the Grand Canyon is less than three minutes.
* Fact: Anything a Chinese person can pee in WILL be peed in. Example: empty water bottles, plastic sandwich baggies, purses, the pocket of a stranger, rectums, vaginas, open sewers (AKA: China)
* Fact: Chinese pussy is hairy and sideways.
* Fact: China almost got nuked in the Sino-Soviet border conflict.
* Fact: Chinese [[women]] have small [[breasts]]. Any Chinese [[women]] you see with normal or large breasts has implants.
* Fact: The [[ED]] website is not censored in China.
* Fact: Chinese families name their newborn babies by gathering their whole family together and smash glass plates on the floor.
* Fact: The Chinese take pleasure in gobbing on pavements, in restaurants and on each other for that matter. This frequent transfer of bodily fluids is considered more effective in getting woman pregnant. Even children, amirite?

===Chinese Childcare===

Children in china are treated like crap: they are either eaten or chained to a post:

Those "lucky" enough to survive till the age of 3 are given the privilege to work for the greater glory of the country in a sweatshop.

[[Image:Chi.jpg|thumb|right|China's filthy people]]




<s>One of the few remaining [[Communist]] regimes in the world, China's leader is always a member of the Communist Party of China.</s> China is now "[[Socialist]]". While the Democratic Party of China, founded in 1998, tried to make a go of it, their leaders were [[Pwnt|promptly detained]] and sent to [[Holocaust|"correction facilities"]].

[[Fascist|President]] Hu Jintao, when he's not busy stomping on kittens, has overseen the rise of China from a third world nation to an [[Wal-Mart|economic superpower]] (but still third world nation). lulwut? Open mouth insert truck of cocks you dumb piece of shit, after the Hillarious Chinacost that oldskool commies unleashed during the Cultural Revolution it was for Deng Xiao Ping to divert the chinacide to what outcummed as an economic development, hence, China finally stopped sucking cock and became [[Wal-Mart|economic superpower]]. There is more to that, If you weren't smoking pot during Elmo Street, you'd know that during WWII China got raeped hard by the Japan niggaz. Back then Commies were nothing but your average Fallout 3 wastelander hobos, living on sucking Russia's delicious cock, Republic of China with Chiang Kai-shek as the Leader owned the street cred in the back days. So, when Japz went partying hard at Shanghai and especially at Nanking, Commies and Kuominttangs didn't give a flying fuck and continued to saw out each other. Eventually they "united" and fought back. Little did they know, that after the war, casaulties were counted and bricks of uranium were said to be shat, for it turned out, that the Japz lost hardly 1.3 million samurais, 700 000 of which were ass fucked as POW's by glorious IVAN's army in Korea, and China managed to get their dicks cut by 30 000 000 (thirty million) people. 1.3 million to 30 millions, kinda tells a lot 'bout chinese army, amirite. So, after the war ended, Chinks had a small civil war beween Commies and Kuomintang ended with Chiang Kai-shek GTFO to Taiwan with all the gold and hookers, thus on 1st October of 1949 People's Republic of China was born. USSR, UK, even Germany were quickly recovering form WWII, but China was still in mid 16-th century, having no industry, no telecom and no 4chan, but as they were commies they pledged for some hadr soviet cock in their tight azn pussies and so a glorious path to Prosperity began. To cut a long story short, Chinks got a fuckton of OIL in factories, telecom, 2ch, 4ch, Chris Hansen, education and even nukes from USSR, 'till Stalin decided to GTFO forever, with Khurshev being Steve Ballmer, Mao got pissed with USSR, they even attacked USSR's border posts in 1969 scoring some frags. And there was but one country, that rejoiced at such an outcome - the US of A. Back in China with no Soviet cock, commie leaders initiated Chinacide, so when Deng Xiao Ping finally got some street cred, he had a fucking great Idea - If we can't have some delicious Soviet Penis, we could ask for PHAT AMERICUNT DONGS in our asses, as it happened with Persident Nixon's Shocking visit to PRC in 1973. Which brings us to the beggings - Deng Xiao Ping is responsible for China's economic growth and the fact, that China WILL ALWAYS CRAVE FOR PHAT COCKS.

China's government is also known for its [[Lie|sterling Human Right's]] record, treating more diverse members of its society such as Falun Gong adherents and Tibetan Buddhists with the utmost [[torture|dignity]] and [[Party_van|respect]].

===Military===

Now with it's own theme music.

<youtube>v5QLZ4oj_6A</youtube>

While China was famous in the past for [[Epic_fail|losing hard]] to the [[Japanese]], [[Russians]], [[Mexicans]], Martians, homosexuals, and 3rd grade girls, the latter half of the 20th Century saw a dramatic turnabout in China's ability to wage war.

In [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] they were notorious for their [[Zerg Rush]]es against [[Americunt]] forces.

Recent advances include: 

* The selling of Nuclear Arms secrets to China by [[Bill Clinton]] (thanks a lot, asshole).
* The selling of uranium to China by [[Australia|drunk convicts]].
* The purchasing of diesel-electric submarines that can sneak up on unsuspecting [[Americunt]] ships.

'''Disadvantages of the China Zerg Rush:''' 
It costs the Chinese government approximately $1 to give their soldiers a cheap uniform and a basic two day training course. That is not difficult. However, it is quite expensive to produce weapons, even if they are cheap, unreliable pieces of shit. Thus, the government forced everyone to learn Kung Fu in hopes that they might have rare chance of winning if they ever get close enough to engage in hand to hand combat. In a group of five Chinamen, there will be one or two with rifles the rest might be armed with Dao swords and Three-section staffs,lol! The others will just throw fireballs at you and hope you die like a low budget kung fu film. China often parades its military equipment since they've made some progress since the "great leap forward" but most of their weapons are outdated. Its a ploy to convince its neighbors that attacking china is fool hardy but the truth is that China only has its massive infantry division as an asset. When the world and china's neighbors realize that china is in reality actually a very weak country with only the power to only oppress its citizens china will get pimp slapped like a overdosed hooker as it has been in the past.

'''Advantages:''' 
No country has unlimited ammunition. If a country is unprepared and doesn't have reserves whilst a group of troops is firing at the [[Zerg_Rush|never ending horde]], a Chinaman will fly around the back and Kung Fu their [[ass]] up. 

Fuck with one, fuck with them all, and you're bound to get Kung Fu-cked Up. <strike>Why bother messing with them?</strike> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT I EAT DOG]].

==Economy==
The people of China are willing to work hard for little money, from a [[Children|young age]] until they drop dead. Without their hard work, most people in places like [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[United States]] would be [[Wal-Mart|naked, living in trees, and eating berries]].

Chinese spies spent years studying the American economy from secret bases in Chinatowns. They copied the capitalistic economy, while keeping the dictatorial political system.

The Chinese mastered the art of sleazy economic competition. They deliberately pegged their Yuan currency to the Dollar so Chinese products always stay cheaper than American, and other developed countries.
It ensures massive Chinese product exports so America and co. are swamped with cheap crap and cannot compete in this unfair trade scheme.
Much of America's industry and jobs has been outsourced to eager Chinese sweatshops. 

The United States turned into an unsustainable consumer country of primarily Chinese products. This dirty trick created an enormous trade deficit and national debt for America.
The American leaders are oblivious to the perils, and spend like drunken sailors, addicted to everything Made in China.

1.00 USD = 7 Chinese Yuan (also known as "one month's wages").

A little known fact is that China owns trillions of dollars worth of U.S. savings bonds, which, if sold, would completely [[Pwn|own]] the [[United States]] economy. Meanwhile, China would cruise easily without the [[fat|United States of America]] consuming everything, which would make China reduce their export prices, thus the rest of the world would have [[prove me wrong|cheaper]] manufactured goods. A good example of such would be the [[almost raped|2008 recession]] in the U.S., in which it didn't really affect China and the developing countries could afford to import more goods. [[cry|Cry cry]] America. China is already richer than America, and even makes almost as much money as the Jew bankers in New York. 

===Economic Policy===
The three step economic policy used by China:
*[[Accidentally]] the paint.
*????
*PROFIT!!!

===Exports===
Some notable Chinese exports include:
*[[McDonald's]] Happy Meal toys
*lead paint
*diseased chicken
*Fleshlights
*African Genocide
*pirated copies of anything and everything
*rice
*<s>Chinese food</s> urban myth, Chinese food is actually made in Wisconsin
*Stuntmen
*Chinatowns that take up all the local jobs
*Malware such as Nimda
*Everything else

==History==

[[Image:GreatFirewall.jpg|thumb|right|The last Great Wall didn't work any better...]]

The People's Republic of China is not an inheritor of previous dynasties which were created by foreign barbarians. The PRC has false imperialistic claims to territories that never belonged to China proper ([[Tibet]], Taiwan, [[East Turkestan]], Inner Mongolia). Despite that, the Chinese Communist Party led by [[Hitler|Mao]] still managed to [[Pwn|conquer]] the two countries of Tibet and [[Arabs|East Turkestan]]. Adding to the humiliation is the fact that China was a mainly aggrarian country when said countries were conquered.

Starting in 1959, the Chinese started dying from famine on a massive scale. One of the consequence is that there are few to no pets in China. Despite [[PETA|what some retards]] say, [[cat|cats]] and [[dogs]] are just food there. One more reason why the Chinese found a way to make just about anything digestible. It is estimated that over 30 million people died. The famine was ended in 1961 by [[Lmao_Zedong|Mao Zedong]] importing grain from the [[capitalist]] countries and making a law that every Chinese can have a handful of rice per day, thus, thwarting [[evolution]].

 
===Chinese Inventions===

The centuries of foreign rule over China means many inventions and achievements were made possible thanks to their foreign overlords. Were it not for their generous intervention, they'd still be living in igloos and hunting jellyfish.

===The Great Wall of China===

[[100_years_ago|At least 100 hundred years]] ago, the Great Wall was built to stave off invading drug lords.

On the other hand, ordering that a great wall be built has turned out to be a very effective form of [[Birth control|population control]], as it is estimated that [[OVER 9000|millions of people died]] constructing the wall over the span of thousands of years and several dynasties.

On a side note, anyone who believes the myth that a 20-foot wide dirt colored wall can be seen from space is fucking retarded. See: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China#Visibility_from_low_earth_orbit FACT]

===Later History===

[[File:Fuckingtestfrogtranks.jpg|thumb|right|Joey "Tank Man" Johnson takes his pack of tanks for a walk.]]

[[Image:InvisibleExecution.jpg|thumb|right|Invisible Execution!]]

Either China made Marco Polo famous, or Marco Polo made China famous. At any rate, now we know what to say when wandering around a dark room. China is known for contributing spaghetti ([[YA RLY]]!)deadly diseases, and useless products to the western civilization.

In the latter half of the 20th Century, China has had [[Lie|good relations]] with its neighboring country, [[Japan]]. In fact, whenever you meet a Chinese person, repeatedly refer to them as Japanese. This will ensure your ability to make many Chinese [[e-pal]]s.

Inexplicably, the Chinese also get extremely offended when they are mistaken for Taiwanese. To [[Lulz|demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of their culture]], always be sure to tell them you are aware that [[Mexico]] is NOT part of China and is in fact an entirely different country.

Deng Xiaoping, China's version of [[Reagan]], was [[Lolwut|inscrutable]]. Was he a stalwart [[Communist]] a [[Capitalist]] reformer? Did he hate our freedom like all [[Communist|Communists]], or did he love money like a Jew?

===Great Firewall of China===
[[Last Thursday]], China embarked on a [[Epic fail|monumental project]] to [[Party Van|protect its citizens]] from the [[CP|evils]] of the [[internets]]. Called the Golden Shield project, every communication is routed through a [[Fail|government firewall]], where it is blocked if it attempts to connect to a [[No|site banned in China]]. Naturally, it [[Epic_fail|works just as well as the last Great Wall]].

P.S:
 [[File:Illegal-flower-halt.jpg]]

===Unit 731===

There have been countless atrocities throughout history many ignored which we can learn from but whenever you're talking a chink you'll be sure to have this mentioned. Hilariously enough many of histories atrocities were committed notoriously by the Chinese themselves including cruel Chinese emperors, Chinese imperial expansionism, Lingchi:death by a 1000 cuts, violent cultural revolutions, Chinese gulags, artificial famines, mass genocide by Mao Zedong, killing Tibetans, stealing Xinjiang from central asian uigurs etc. The list could go on forever...Instead of learning from Unit 731 as a humbling experience for china to never be belligerent again. China became worse and more aggressive, now china had a reason to adopt a victim mentality(while others who have been persecuted move on)furthering their agenda for imperialism and world domination covertly. Whenever you mention any of China's bad points they will immediately BAAAWWW!!! and bring UNIT 731 up. 

[[Image:Unit731-logs.jpg|thumb|left|A Unit 731 Log Inspector]]Unit 731 was a [[epic]] underground complex full of [[4chan|sekret stuffs]], and if you don't know what it is you should probably Google it, because its full of epic win and [[CP]], but to sum it up...  

Unit 731 (pronounced CHING-CHONG NIP NONG NONG) was a [[Lulz|covert biological and chemical warfare]] research and development unit of the [[Sick fuck|Imperial Japanese Army]] that undertook [[Tentacle rape|lethal human experimentation]] during World War II. It was responsible for some of the most hilarious war crimes carried out by Japanese personnel, including the killing of thousands of logs.

There is some question to whether UNIT 731 was an actual event or not many times throughout history we hear a one sided story mainly told by the victors of wars and China during WW2 was part of the allied powers. Many in Japan call into question UNIT 731 as an actual event because China is known for its dubious claims especially about history. Interestingly enough many Koreans joined the Japanese when they invaded china. The Chinese are known for propaganda especially the Chinese cinema which is very famous in continent of asia and in the United States because Chinks have infested [[Hollywood]].

==Culture==

[[Image:Vram-Win.jpg|thumb|Kai Yat Sai, [[for great justice]].]]

While the Chinese [[government]] is surprisingly [[Atheist|non-religious]], those who are [[retarded|religious]] must adhere to one of the [[Yes|state-sanctioned]] [[religion|religions]], such as [[Buddhism]], Taoism, Confucianism, or [[Christianity]] and even they are imprisoned sometimes. Members of [[No|non-sanctioned]] religions such as Falun Gong are [[Party Van|V&]] and sent to [[Jail|correction facilities]], where their vital organs are harvested and [[Profit|sold on the black market]]. Although things are looking to change as religion is now flourishing in china.

According to [[John Lennon]], [[win|''If you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow.'']]

Average Chinese [[children]] spend [[Over_9000|up to 200%]] of their time in sweatshops. They have most likely created your shoes, braces, computers, houses, electronics and food. [[Owned|The average sweatshop laborer receives a maximum of ten grains of rice per day.]] The Chinese think that having a daughter is very unfortunate, which is obviously [[loli|wrong]]. When [[Obama]] went to China to discuss the issues the people were facing, all they could think about was the fact that he had two daughters in a row.

{{quote|You already have 2 daughters. Will you try for a third? And if it is still a daughter, what would you think about that?|Lzm048 asks [[Obama]] a hard one}}

===Food===

Many [[American]]s think of [[cock|eggrolls]], General Tsao's (or Tso's, Gau's, Zor's, Chau's) [[chicken fight|chicken]], and chop suey as Chinese food. However, all of this is untrue. "Chicken" is actually made from the stray cats in the alleys of Chinatowns while chop suey is in fact a traditional [[Armenia]]n dish popularized by the band [[System of a Down]]. 

To easily sum up most oriental foods, if its incredibly disgusting, rare, or endangered, they will consume it in mass quantities.

One must travel to China to find true, authentic Chinese food. Feast on such mouth-watering delicacies as:
* Everything's uterus
* Cat and Dog
* Beef tripe
* Fried eel
* Tiger penis
* Internal Organs of [[victim complex|Persecuted]] [[fundie|Falun Gong]] followers.
* Swallow bird's nest
* Shark fin
* Chicken gizzards
* Marinated squid and jellyfish [[tentacle rape|tentacles]]
* Roast pigeon

The Chinese, enamored to the magical delicacy of American invented [[Slurpee]]s, have allowed Western convenience stores to infiltrate the shit hole province of Guangzhou and it's Specially Economical Zone of Shenzhen. [[Last Thursday]], thousands of [[7-11]]s sprouted up in all sizes from kiosk to full size store.

===Strange Chinese Dishes===

Some Chinese eat Baby Soup which contains a deceased human fetus and costs about $4000. Chinese eat Baby Soup to increase overall health, stamina and the power of sexual performance.

===Sports===
The Chinese are notoriously great at gymnastics, martial arts, figure skating, ping pong, stuntmen and putting people before firing squads. However, their prowess in Western [[sports]] is [[Basketball|limited to the freakishly tall Yao Ming.]] The Chinese especially seem to excel at sports when the event is held in china with Chinese judges where they seem to become world champions with a history of winning consecutively.

===Language===
The entire Chinese language consists of two syllables: ''[[Rosie O'Donnell|cheech]]'' and ''[[Rosie O'Donnell|chong]]''. Linguistic scholars<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs no citation." class="noprint">&#91;[[Citation_needed|''citation&nbsp;not&nbsp;needed'']]&#93;</sup> believe this to be the origin of the term "[[Azn|Ching Chong Chinaman]]." Even to a cunning linguist who sees differences with types of words, even with the approximately five different tone inflections, there still is an irritatingly huge number of homophones. Fortunately, lulz can be harvested; the symbol for slave [[pimp|looks like the symbol of a woman near the symbol of a right hand]], and the literal translation for their name of Africa, fei zhou, is "wrong continent". Not necessarily ugly, but the Chinese language generally sounds like cats trying to imitate a drum set.

According to a [[shit nobody cares about|report]] [[over 9000|at least 100,000,000]] Chinese died in accidents in 2007, this is a dramatic 10% drop from the previous year. Some officials cite less hazards in the workplace such as two inspections per year rather than just one, a [[doing it wrong|gun]] to encourage factory workers to do it right, and signs that replace 'do <s>not</s> touch this' with images of [[buttsecks|smiley communist pandas describing what can happen with images of a mangled worker]].

==U.S.-China Relations==
The Chinese word for [[America]] is 美國, pronounced meiguo, a transliteration which means literally "beautiful country". This would seem to be overtly flattering; however, the first character 美 (mei), though it does mean beautiful, is a vertical combination of the characters 大 (da) and 羊 (yang), meaning, respectively, "large" and "sheep".

The contrast between the conspicuous "beautiful" and the subtler "big sheep" contains a hidden truth and tells you everything you need to know about China's [[Rich_and_beautiful|public]] versus [[Dumbass|private]] opinions of [[Americunts|America and Americans]]. Rightly so.
