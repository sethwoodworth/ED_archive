2007
[[Image:2007.PNG|thumb|320px|1 image summary]]
'''2007''', [[Microsoft]]'s patch for the faulty [[2006]], has been proven to be just as buggy as the last year.

[[Don't taze me bro|Some end users were tazed]]. Some gained sexual attractions Ebon Lupus, [[Andrew Erickson|children]], and even [[Ray Jones|cartoon mice]]. Some flew off the handle and killed [[Megan Meier|themselves]]. Many even died from [[Asa Coon|bullet]] [[Seppo Lehto|related]] [[Virginia Tech massacre|injuries]].

Yes, this glitchy release has caused [[Fox News|vans to explode off of their frames]], [[The Caturday Nap|monolithic meeting places to disappear]], and all the beautiful women either [[Anna Nicole Smith|died]] or were given [[2girls1cup|worse fates]].

[[CSIII|Leading scientists]] have traced these errors to an [[Jenkem|optional feature]] known to cause [[Chocolate Rain|unpleasant side effects]].

2007 has proved itself to be as terrible as the old 06 model. Luckily, we are quite certain that life will be improved drastically as soon as [[2008]] comes out, hopefully in time for Christmas.
