The Principality of Sealand is a [[troll]] country near Great Britain. Way back in 1967 Paddy Roy Bates, after he got pissed at that jerk [[UK]] for denying him his own pirate radio, set out to find land he could found a new nation on. Because [[the man]] had already occupied all natural territory Bates got creative and claimed an abandoned WWII defense platform six miles off the coast of Suffolk. However, it wasn't without a fight because some [[Ireland|mick]] had already taken the platform but Bates quickly told him to [[GTFO]]. Thus Sealand was born and Bates crowned himself principal and sovereign Roy of Sealand. 
Since then, many [[lulz]] were had.

==History==
===UK responds===
The British couldn't do shit as Sealand was out of their territorial reach but they [[Nice try|tried anyway]]. When they attempted to blitzkrieg Sealand royal son prince Michael Bates kicked their asses with the help of [[k/|/k/]]. The [[butthurt]] invaders then [[CoS|called for a lawyer]] to send the [[Party van|party boat]] to Sealand. The court dismissed the case because Sealand was still out of the UK's territorial waters and the whiners were told to [[STFU|shut up]]. People ignoring the court's decision continued to demand tax money anyway, showing that the UK is in fact run by Jews.

===Nazi putsch===
In 1975 the [[German]] [[Hitler|Alexander Gottfried Achenbach]] and several Dutch people planned to take over Sealand to turn it into a [[Nazi|fascist dictatorship]]. Achenbach told Bates that he wanted to establish a hotel with [[casino]]. Roy trusted him and appointed him Prime Minister. Achenbach betrayed that trust, staged a coup d’état and held the royal son captive while Roy was in [[Germany|Salzburg]]. When he heard of that Roy rented a helicopter and [[pwn|pwn]]ed the nazis. The Dutch were soon released but Achenbach remained imprisoned. The Netherlands and Germany told the UK to [[war|take action]] but their pleas remained unheard as the UK stopped to care what happened off their coast. Germany proceeded to send a diplomat to get Achenbach free, proving Sealand to be [[serious business]]. After Achenbach was set free he set up an exile government, [[Shit nobody cares about|still claiming that he is the legitimate ruler of Sealand]].

===Sealand attempts to make money===

Eventually Roy decided he'd rather bang some Spanish hookers and left the nation to his son. In 2000 Michael Bates decided to get more money by buying a company he then called HavenCo whose purpose was to provide a data haven. [[Spammer|Spammer]]s, [[Hacker|Hacker]]s and [[pedophile|pedophile]]s would have benefited from such a service had they not been discriminated against. With its main potential customers alienated HavenCo ceased to exist in 2008.
In January 2007 Sealand was put up for sale and [[The Pirate Bay]] tried to purchase it. The royals however refused because they saw those noble activists as mere criminals guilty of theft of proprietary rights.

===Other happenings===
*Shortly after Sealand was founded the UK [[Griefer|destroyed another abandoned platform that was outside of their waters]].
*Sealand passports were revoked in 1997 because people started to use them for tax fraud, smuggling and organ trade.
*In 2006 a major fire broke out. Essentially, [[Epic fail|a defective generator almost destroyed the whole nation]]. Compare to [[South_Ossetia#Georgia.27s_Military_.28aka_Epic_Fail_Guys.29|Georgia's military]].

==Legitimacy of Sealand as a sovereign nation==

Contrary to what your government will tell you, Sealand is a separate country, if only to piss the [[Queen]] off. The argument that Sealand's surface is artificial is dismissible if one takes a look at the Netherlands. With such arguing one could easily deny the existence of the country's major parts as they were made '''artificially''' accessible through the use of levees. Countless lulz ensue when one of them breaks during storm surge.

==Sealand on the internets==
[[Image:Sealand_in_second_life.jpg|right|thumb|Sealand in Second Life]]
There's a [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=28008014536 group] on [[Facebook]] dedicated to Sealand. If you're one of the people who'd rather spend money on a title from a sea platform than on something actually worth something, this group is for [[you]].
The same goes for [http://www.sealandnews.com/forum/index.php?referrerid=5 this forum]. While discussing topics such as [[retard|sports in a country only 550m² in area]] they set a good example for the average person's [[IQ]] on the Internet. 

Sealand is also present in [[Second Life]] and could come in handy as a backup for [[Fort Longcat]].

However, Sealand's presence on the internettes is not upfront but through blatant plagiarism on part of a group of [[rich|Northern]] [[retard|California]] [[Libertarian]] [[Jewish]] [[Hippy]] [[Nerd|Ectomorphs]] who can't swim otherwise known as [http://seasteading.org/ "The Seasteading Institute"].
