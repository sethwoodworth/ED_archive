Socially Awkward Penguin

[[Image:SAP.jpg|thumb|right|150px]]

Sometimes known as Awkward Situation Penguin. A relatively new [[newfag|spin-off]] of the Advice Dog meme. Socially Awkward Penguin can [[nevar|occasionally]] be [[Unfunny|lulz-y]], but most of the time either [[Unfunny|somewhat funny]] or [[unfunny]]. Its [[fail|popularity]] is slowly rising, and he has surpassed Depression Dog and Insanity Wolf.

The secret of this penguin's popularity would probably be [[Anonymous|Anon's]] pleasure of sharing awkward experiences, which are evidently manifold. Since every /b/tard is socially awkward, SAP threads usually get flooded by replies consisting of [[Unwarranted self importance|"so true, i get that all the time"]] posts. But as all [[No|good]] things, Socially Awkward Penguin is slowly fading out nowadays, because some [[Memegenerator]] locals [[Trying too hard|went too far]] with it, so it became a [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|cancerous]] hybrid of awkwardness, [[Depression Dog]] and failure. At the time of writing there doesn't seem to be a '''FAIL + ANIMAL''' (Ferret maybe?) meme yet - but there's no doubt that [[You|you]] have the credentials to [[Forced Meme|invent]] one.

In response to the [[Profit|commercial]] success the penguin achieved, Memegenerator was flooded with awful variations, even though 99% of them had only 1 image and never actually caught on to 4chan. Probably the only successful one was Socially Awesome Penguin (oh the [[irony]]!), which was basically the same thing only coloured in red and described situations opposite to those of socially awkward ones. But since there aren't any [[Rich and beautiful|socially adept]] people on the known web - and certainly not [[4chan]], it is rare that someone ever contributes to this awful spin-off-of-a-spin-off. Other than that, there is Socially Average Penguin, which is just [[Unrealistic expectations|too much]] and simply [[GRIDS|boring]].
