Politics
[[Image:IRpolitician.png|thumb|Truly an accurate depiction.]]

Politics is something that [[Liberals|people]] on the [[Internets]] like to pretend they know a lot about.  It's the art or science of appearance of government or governing, especially the governing of a political entity by monkeys, such as a nation, and the administration and illusion of control of its internal and external affairs.

If you want to know more about politics, consider [[heroin|drugs]], electric shock therapy, and if the urge persists, [[shit band|Napalm Death]]; if the music doesn't kill you, the practice hopefully will.
[[Political communities]] on [[LiveJournal]] are awash with [[troll]]s and [[idiots]].

A politician is someone with a negative IQ who [[President Barack Hussein Obama|manages to convince enough stupid people]] that they are fit to make important decisions about how a society should be organized. There are a number of ways they might go about this, including:

*Pretending to care
*Threatening [[violence]]
*[[Lie|Lying]] 
*Bribery
*Sucking every voting-age citizen's dick, one man at a time.
*Gaining support of famous talking heads through method #4
*Not being a member of the Nazi party
*Having a [[Karl Rove|Satanic Douchebag]] as your adviser. lol, politics

===Policies on honesty===
Politicians are held to strict dishonesty policies. Any politician caught telling the truth [[fail|fails]] and is immediately [[b&]]. 

The reason for this rule is that if [[Old Meme|at Least 100]] politicians tell the truth at the same time it will have the same effect as [[divide by zero|dividing by zero]].
