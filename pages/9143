World's Ugliest Dog
[[Image:Samuglydog.jpg|thumb|center|750px|The definition of '''[[Coyote Ugly]]''': chewing off your own leg to get away from yourself.]]

This is Sam. He's been dubbed "'''The World's Ugliest Dog'''" three times in a row. Sam is some kind of [[Chinese|Chinger]] breed of dog, is blind and is also [[fucking]] ugly. Of course, there are a few things that come close to the ugliness of Sam, like [[Juliana Wetmore]], but there are still [[Goatse|far]] [[tubgirl|worse]] [[lemonparty|things]] [[Rosie|on]] [[Rule 34|the]] [[Mr. Hands|internet]]. Sam is also the ultimate manifestation of [[Dog CurtainsÂ©]]. Too bad he's dead, 'cause we could've [[kill it with fire|killed him with fire.]]


==The Pet Himself==

[[Some argue]] Sam was a purebreed ([[srsly]]) Chinese Crested hairless dog. Others know he was the combined product of [[AIDS]]-infected [[Furry]] [[Mpreg]]. Sam was originally considered unadoptable by animal shelters because he was not only [[ugly]] but also vicious, probably as a result of looking like he'd been dragged behind a car for 30 miles like a black person.

Sam's incredible ugliness earned him a celebrity lifestyle - riding in limos, eating gourmet food and even meeting [[Donald Trump]].
Such news should come as a huge disappointment to [[furries]] because no matter how much they try and make themselves look [[shotacon|cute]] and [[fat|sexy]], this hideous little mutt was more popular and loved than they could ever be.

In 2006, Sam passed away aged 15. This came as a great shock to all who knew him, since he looked like he'd been dead for a long, long time.
