The '''iTunes Store''' is yet another [[monopoly]] run by [[Apple]] which sells piss-poor quality DRM-laden music to suckers who can't figure out how to get [[warez|music for free]].  Opening as the '''iTunes Music Store''' before [[9/11]], it proved the viability of [[Jews|ripping people off]]. As of December 2007, the store has sold [[over 9000]] songs to countless [[fags|suckers]], accounting for [[over 9000]]% of worldwide online digital music sales (But only 5% of all music downloaded off the [[Interweb]], SUCK SHIT FRUIT COMPUTER!!). Most downloaded files come with restrictions on their use, enforced by threat of [[internet jail]]. However, late in the game, Apple started releasing "DRM-Free" tracks which can be played on other players, though [[audiophile|their bit rate is still poor]].

==Facts and figures==
* Apple music can be played on iPods.
* Apple music can only be used on 5 computers at a time because Apple's team is full of [[unfunny]] [[Jews]] that don't think you have the right to use what you own however the fuck you want.
* Now you can pay through the nose to download iTunes music on your bulky iPhone which already has an [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE7d7ji7aAo over $9000] phone bill to begin with from using it to download [[porn]]. The same can be done on the [[Izzlepod|iPod Touch]], though only [[retard]]s have purchased said device.
*To counter [[Microsoft]] and their constant release of updates, iTunes will notify you of a new update pack on every start, no matter how many times you've told it to [[GTFO]].
*If you actually buy music from the iTunes store, you are a [[Fag]].

To appeal to all the [[gooks]] and [[niggers]] halfway across the world, it is now possible to download Ayumi Hamasaki in [[at least 100]] countries worldwide.  This includes third-world hellholes such as Africa, where the only thing more common than niggers that don't have internets is [[AIDS]]. However, select songs are still available only in their home countries, making iTunes [[shit|absolute rubbish]] should you be interested in finding music that isn't [[old media|shoved down your throat by MTV]].

The only people [[You|stupid enough]] to actually buy the shitty music from this so called "Store" are those fucking [[americans]] that are too [[Fucktard|fucktarded]] to notice that '''YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE MUSIC FOR FREE ON YOUTUBE OMFG'''. Oh, and when you listen to it on [[youtube]], it '''COMES WITH A VIDEO OF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE DANCING AROUND OMFG''' (Its better to watch the shitty video than stare at a brick wall while listening to the song you know). Here's a list of other dumbasses that actually waste their money on this store:

* [[You]]
* People that work for apple
* [[Steve Jobs]]
* [[Dane Cook]]
* [[Bill Gates]]


==Reviews==
[[Image:Itunesscreenie.png|thumb|200 px|The louzy report system on iTunes.]]
On iTunes you can leave reviews for the music and products on it even if you don't buy it. So, of
course this leads to a bunch of really bored people one starring everything they hate.. You will NEVER find any reviews that are not five or one starred, let alone any with helpful information. Once one starred and negatively reviewed (whether honest or opinion-based) by basement dwellers, emo fanboys will be crying butthurt and begin writing long five starred reviews, about how much [[My Chemical Romance|My Chemical Romance]] rocks and how they can go die in a fury pit of fire if the haterz don't like their music.

So what does iTunes do about these horrible useless reviews? Nothing! Don't worry though, if you get angry over a negative review you can always report it for disagreeing. I shit you not.
