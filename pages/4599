Kineticlightning
[[Kineticlightning]] is an [[e-psychiatrist]] currently residing on [[DeviantART]]. 

An avid member of the [[snapesnogger]] fanclub, KineticLightning spends her days protecting the [[DeviantART]] [[diva]] from the hordes of [[/b/]], [[4chan]], and the terrible [[abuse]] brought on by the average [[DeviantART]] user who dares not to praise and worship the ground she walks on.

Hailing from her home planet the University of Tennessee with the rest of her [[goth]] [[lesbian]] girlfriends, she seeks to use her [[skillz]] in understanding the language of [[fucktards]] to change the world by proving the fundamentals of basic psychology to be false and that mental diagnosis of people over the [[tubes]] can be accomplished simply by her adding them to her watchlist and reading their online [[journal]] from as far away as halfway around the planet. The complete listing of her "patients" is unknown, but [[snapesnogger]] and [[toukan]] have both received her input on every facet of their online personal life.

When not consulting Miss Cleo to help her cheat on her final exams from prison, KineticLightning indulges in activities such as [[camwhoring]] in hopes that an [[internet]] [[stalker]] will tell her she's pretty.

Currently there is no news on what e-college she earned her e-degree in e-psychology in, nor what e-facility she served as an intern for, but rumors abound that outdated psychology books from the 1820's and perhaps [[Wikipedia]] may have played a part in her learnings.

Not to be confused with a currently non-active user by the username 'kinetic-lightning'.

== KineticLightning approves of ED! ==

Latest journal entries from this [[fatty]] [[attention whore|punk rock]] [[goth|goth chick]] say that she is actually flattered by this article and admits wholeheartedly that it's all true. 

Also in the comments are plans to run off to Australia where her and her harem will met up with the famed [[snapesnogger|SnapeSnogger]] to go get drunk. It has not yet been confirmed if this is in fact a plan to [[rape|raep]] the [[DeviantART]] out of some twisted and perverse fetish that involves having [[feminazi|lesbian relations]] with [[whining|whiney]] [[attention whore|internet celebrities]].

Perhaps the [[ban]] feature on [[snapesnogger|Snapesnogger's]] [[DeviantART]] would be put to better use to kick this [[ugly]] [[stalker]] in the manboobs instead of against people who dare to offer the criticism that she's been guilty of having begged for dozens of times in the past.
