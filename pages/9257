Yirimyah, is an [[Australia]]n [[twink]] best known for faking his suicide to get atttention on the Internet. His hobbies include sucking dicks of [[lemonparty|older men]] in Perth for rent money and getting trains run on him at italo disco events. 

Like every Aussie ever, Yiri seeks to further [[murder|reduce the rights]] of [[abbo|Aboriginies]]. Unlike every Aussie ever, he looks like a [[heroin]] using [[twink]] whose [[nudes]] are freely available throughout the [[internets]]. Although he has been known to post n00dz to various [[live journal]] communities like your average camwhore fag, he seems to go through girlfriends faster than a junkie through a baggie of [[heroin|china white]] when the welfare check arrives.

Yiri's mother claims he is part Aboriginal. 

==Last Night an [[ED IRC|#ed]] Saved My Life==
[[Image:Yiri.gif|thumb|The tale retold.]]
Arguably the only positive thing that [[ED IRC|#ed]] has ever accomplished in its long and [[cool story bro|storied]] history was when it saved yiri from pulling a [[an hero|ctrl+alt+del]] on his life in October of 2007. After posting a [[tl;dr]] suicide note online and playing Pacman IRL with a few boxes of pills, #ed [[dox|dropped dox]] and called the ambulance to his place of residence, which found him dead at the scene. Yiri's heart stopped three times, but the doctors refused to let him die and kept resuscitating him. The next few months were notable for his sporadic online presence, as he had to use his shit laptop to hack [[The_Gibson|the Gibson]] at [[hilarious|the psych ward he was confined]] to in order to get on [[IRC]].
 
Note: The above story was faked by Yiri for attention. He posted a suicide note but nobody bothered to call an ambulance because they knew he was faking it, and wouldn't care even if he wasn't.
