'''Nintendocore''' is a genre of "music" created by nostalgia [[fags]] who make shitty 8-bit music incorporating Screamo[[Screamo]].
otherwise referred to as cybergrind or digigrind, and less commonly as Segacore (<strike>which is complete bullshit because SEGA has never been 8-bit, it was 16-bit, and all nintendocore is 8-bit</strike> Somebody's never heard of the Master System or Game Gear. Derp).

List of [[SHIT]]:
*'''Horse the band''' 
<youtube>RF_v7ek5o-s</youtube> 
not to be mistaken for "band of horses" a.k.a. [[Lie|good music]], these are the [[asshole|ASSHOLES]] who started this major [[faggot|faggotry]]. Their lead singer looks like a fucking walrus and 100% of his fans want to have sex with his mustache. There are [[over 9000]] videos of the lead singers [[ass]] and [[dick]] floating online, even on [[youtube|youtube]]. the vocals are just completely and utterly messy and not screamed, but yelled. The lead singer coined the term nintendocore because they use 8-bit synthesis in their songs obviously. what kind of masochist listens to this act of vulgarity upon the ears? Horse the band is the longest existing nintendocore band ever created and has been around somewhere along the year 2000 and is still chugging. If you like to mutilate your genitalia then this is for you

*'''Iamerror''' (iae) made up of two hypocritical [[scene]] hipster faggots making shitty grind, their songs usually talk about the annoying things in old video-games. Such as [[metapod]] who is completely useless "from the beginning I always knew you were useless", their music is tinny as hell, their first album was complete shit with the most generic guitar playing ever. The Iamerror fan-base is made up of scene kids and emos who would gladly have sex with the neckbeareded guitarist and O-face screams vocalist Peter Bunke.  
*'''I shot the duck hunt dog''' (istdhd) a circa survive wannabe band who makes post hardcore mixed with nintendocore. When they aren't blatantly copying Iamerror, they like to get publicity by being complete [[attention whores]]. They claimed to everybody on [[myspace]] that their vocalist had died to boost their popularity and changed their myspace band name on many occasions to things like: "Paramore shot the duck hunt dog" to gain popularity. If you can actually understand the lyrics to their songs behind the [[earrape]] bitch screams, you will notice that the lyrics happen to be the most profane and gargled shit to ever be written: "Bowser is a fucking cunt!" as an example. Their vocalist Cory has the most whiny vocals ever to be recorded along with [[earrape]] screaming that completely clouds over the instrumentals.
*'''Insert disc''' (moar like insert dick amirite?) now called Dr.Drank, this asswipe thought he was god among '''nintendocore''' artists. Insert disc writes music by simply going up and down the scale on the piano roll, this takes no talent and is a method used by almost every fucking nintendocore artist. 
*'''We butter the bread with butter''' (wbtbwb) About 78% of nintendocore artists come from Germany, this band happens to be one of the most popular German nintendocore artists. Their music is completely talentless, random notes, chugging guitar and bar chords are always used in their songs. 
*'''Ephemeral dreamer''' sucks ass. need we say more?
*'''Rawesome''' is the only artist known to suck peet's dick on contact
*'''Monomate'''
<youtube>6bFZNYA2A-w</youtube> 
After becoming dis-interested in his previous works, Peter Bunke changed his artist name to "Monomate". Many pubescent [[butt hurt]] 13-16 year-old fan-boiz go to the Monomate [[Myspace]] page and cry about how much better Iamerror was than Monomate.[[File:Monofag.png|thumbnail|right|[[lie|Peet Bunke is a scene kid]]]] Many fan-boiz deify Peter, they also vent their sexual frustration on peter with fallacious comments about how they want to have sex with him (and sometimes his hair), it is fact that all of his fans are closet homosexuals and they are unaware themselves of this. Peter himself is a homosexual whom enjoys trolling his fans and insulting pop culture "icons". According to Peters myspace comments, Peter enjoys being called "PEET" [[dying alone|and if you call him Peter he hunt you down and kill everyone you love]]
. To troll "Peet" go to his myspace page and always call him "Peter" instead of "PEET", write your sentences with as many spelling mistakes as you can while using the language of L337: "HA1 P3T3R D1D U KN03 THAT IAE IS BETTUR THAN MONOM8!!!11!??/!"
*'''Vernal equinox''' an emo gayfag who has thousands of girls adding him on [[Myspace]] going wet pussy on him, this guy sounds like a frog on crack when he screams. 
*'''iii!!!''' how the fuck are we supposed to pronounce that band name
*'''shoveling driveways for drug money''' (sdfdm) see artist below for information on this artist
*'''oak's parcel''' after changing his band name to oaks parcel from "shoveling driveways for drug money" (pokefag) he continued to make the same shitty '''Nintendocore'''
*'''Take a spin down rainbow road''' (tasdrr) see below for more information (name change)
*'''vaila''' once again, another poser band that only exists because of bampots like IAE. Sadly this is probably as bad as it gets with lyrics like: "this town is so kewl" and generic lyrics like: "FUCK YOU MARIO FUCK FUCK", and with trying to re-invent itself with a [[fat]], metal head Tosin Abasi wannabe, but they cant even do that right!
*'''I wonder whats for dinner''' (iwwfd, ytp reference lolz)

== Listeners/Creators ==
the average '''nintendocore''' artist falls into these two categories:
*Nostalgia [[fag]] (20-35 year old): while living <s>and having sex</s> with his [[mom]], he buys FL studio and downloads a bunch of VSTs. Then found a nerdy [[emo]] [[faggot]] (see below) who can scream and/or play guitar. 
*Nerdy [[emo]] [[faggot]] (13-19): while complaining about how hard his life is he came across an already existing '''Nintendocore''' band and wanted to fucking copy them. This '''nintendocore''' artist knows how to scream ([[emo]] [[faggots]] all can, no exceptions) and plays guitar, this [[faggot]] never played any NES games but like most [[emo]] teens, they would buy anything with an 8-bit design on it (shirts, shoes, ties, etc...)

== NINTENDOCORE WARS ==
for many eons a war has been waged between the two fan boi machines MONOMATE and VAILA.
after the FL studio gods had bestown their glory upon the two angels of music, Christian Fenn (VAILA) and pete bunke (MONOMATE)

peet had been talking amongst is disciples of A musical renaissance he would bring upon them if they had followed his commandments 
-thou shalt not ask when peet cometh anywhere that is not of the land of south California
