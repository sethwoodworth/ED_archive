Fursona
[[Image:Gembeck.JPG|thumb|400px|This man doesn't need his '''Fursona'''. He's already a [[sick fuck|sexy beast]]!]]
The animal "alter ego" of a [[furry]], a '''Fursona''' is usually far less [[Fat|obese]] than their real-life form. The word is a [[portmanteau]] of "furry" and "persona". Fursonaona is toa  furry what a [[screen name]] or avatar is to a sane person.  

Sadly, [[serious business|furfags take it way more serious than that]].

The basic difference between "just a character" and a "Fursona" is how a furry reacts to any remotely insulting remark made about the furry thing represented in the image.
* Character: sane, rational response. Well, as sane and rational as a furry can get anyway.
* Fursona: [[BAWWW|OMG! WTF!]] [[NO U|STFU, N00b!!1!1]]

==Kinds of Fursona==

There are three basic types of Fursonas: 
* Self-insert
* Wish fulfillment
* Mental illness

====Self Insert====
[[Image:Furson.jpg|thumb|right|Self insert for a total fag. Note the extra fuckholes + cock.]]
Furries lack all imagination. This is why all they ever draw are heavily sexualized popular creatures (wolf, dragon, fox, ect) [[yiff|having sex with one another]]. Unable to even come up with a character of their own, the furry [[Self-insert|sticks themself into the picture]]. 

However, as nobody wants to see their ugly, fat asses, the furry tries to make what they think is sexy in replacement for their [[fat|bloated asses]] and tiny [[penis|baby cock]]s. This typically results in sluttified [[Mary Sue]]s only where a Mary Sue has special powers, a self-insert merely has [[fail|a dog dick]].

Example description. Parts that match reality will be in '''bold.'''

''Pomegranate is a sexy [[horse|equitaur]] '''around the age of 20'''. [[fag|Shi]] '''loves racing, sports, Rap music, and anal sex''' with great big studs like yourself. [[Hir]] dick is about two feet long with large, '''[[desperate|full balls ready to explode]]''' for the right fella. Cum on over and fill hir up with hot seed to really hear hir moan.'' 

====Wish Fulfillment====

Furries hate themselves. You would hate yourself, too, if you were a thirty-year-old [[gay|jailhouse gay]] waste of flesh [[fap]]ping in [[babyfur|shit-stained diapers]] to [[furry art|half-animal porn]] in your mother's basement. To escape the eternal self loathing, these sad sacks of shit create fursonas.

The major difference between a self insert fursona and a wish fulfillment fursona are the fursona's abilities. Self inserts typically do not have special powers nor do they have fancy back stories. Many are literally the [[you|owner of the fursona]] with [[bestiality|fur slapped on so people will fuck it]].

Wish Fulfillment fursonas take this way into [[Mary Sue]] territories. Everyone is beautiful with a tragic past and just needs the power of love to unlock even more godlike powers! [[Mary Sue|The funsona always wins the fight because they are the best and everyone loves them]]. Descriptions go on for pages and use really stupid words like "oculars". 

Here is a short example. The truth about the player is in links.

''Alessa is a [[fat|very beautiful young wolf]], [[man|her]] [[man the harpoons|shapely body and perfect curves]] attract the eye of many an onlooker. black person flow to just below her shoulders, and [[ugly|silken fur envelops her form]]. [[Emo|The cowl of a long black hooded cloak]] obscures her face leaving [[Brown|storm grey occulars]] to [[Emo|gaze out mournfully]]. On her back is the [[fail at life|legendary blade the Sword of Dracon]], which she compliments with a [[Prep|pair of beautiful, golden bracers]] on her [[man the harpoons|delicate wrists]]. Incredibly, a [[FYIAD|pair of wondrous, gorgeous white dragonic wings grow out of her back]], the [[no|strong, muscular]] wings easily capable of flight. However, all that you see now only belies her [[Inuyasha|half-demoness blood]]... this is just one of two forms... ''

====Mental Illness====

Sometimes just wishing you were sexy isn't enough. Sometimes you really think that you are a nine dicked fox dragon from [[fag|Uranus]] sent here on Earth for a mercy mission. [[batshit insane|All those pictures of your "fursona" actually are your true form, and you roleplay to get in touch with your real self.]] Anyone who says this is untrue just does not know you well enough.

Congrats: your [[batshit insane]] [[furry|fascination with animals]] has degenerated to full blown actual batshit insanity. You no longer know the difference between something you made up and reality and are blending the two into your online form AKA "Fursona". 

[[GTFO|Get the fuck out of the furry fandom]]. [[truth|You are not a furry]], you are an [[otherkin]].

Example:

''The feline enchantress who dwells in in her [[Furcadia|magical garden]] in a quiet corner of Kasuria. Emerald does not remember her beginnings and it is rumored she is from the ancient times, the [[bitch|glow of her warm heart]] keeping her [[old|forever young]]. She looks to be of [[elf|elven heritage]], with long, flowing, auburn hair that lights like a living flame in the sun, and her [[Mary Sue|shining emerald eyes can see through to your soul]]. It is said that to anger her, though, will bring a rain of fire and dread to your heart.''

==Common Fursona traits==
Regardless of the kind of fursona, there are a few traits that seem to be universal.

Fursona names often show up as a screen name or the screen name will be related to the fursona in some way. For example, if the screen name says "Bunny Bitch" the fursona is actually [[obvious|named Bunny Bitch]], or the fursona is a [[gay|faggoty]] [[horny|rabbit]] that [[anal|loves taking it in the ass]] [[GRIDS|whenever possible]].

All of them are animal based. [[Rule 34|No exceptions]]. It does not have to have fur to be a furry: raptors, dragons, eagles and other non furry animals also count. The animal must be a popular animal, however, as furries are insecure fucktards who wish they were popular. 

An animal screen name does not always mean it is a fursona, however, it usually is a good warning.
