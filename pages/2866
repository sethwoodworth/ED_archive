'''Fantasy''' is a type of [[entertainment]] enjoyed by [[basement dweller]]s who aren't cool enough to hang with [[Science Fiction]] fans.

==Types of Fantasy==

Fantasy entertainment takes many different forms.  

* Gaming fantasy, such as [[Magic]] and [[LARP]]ing. The former is a card game for [[13 year old boys]], but enjoyed mostly by adults.  The latter is a type of [[role-playing]] game, where you actually run around in costume like a [[retarded]] person. Usually inspired by Tolkien.

*Fantasy magazines such as ''Heavy Metal'' and ''Wizard''. These magazines feature art, but it's mainly an excuse for their creators to [[Masturbate|fap]] over the big-titted women they invariably draw. Usually inspired by Tolkien.

* Fantasy books, which write about actual [[dinosaurs]] and require no budget. Unless it's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', it's guaranteed to [[suck]]. ''Always'' inspired by Tolkien.

* Fantasy movies, which show actual [[dinosaurs]] and require massive budgets.  Even if it's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', it's guaranteed to [[suck]]. Especially if [[black people]] are allowed to play any other roles than the orcs. Because black elves RUIN EVERYTHING. Actually ''is'' Tolkien.

* Fantasy daydreams, in which the fantasist has [[unlimited disposable income]], isn't a pale - faced geek, and even (in the severest cases) might be somewhat attractive. No matter what, it's guaranteed to involve the latest Playboy girl giving the fantasist a [[suck]].

==Fantasy Traits==
Most forms of fantasy share at least one of the following:

* [[Dinosaurs]] - Giant, fire breathing creatures that fly. Unlike real dinosaurs, fantasy dinosaurs don't typically speak or run for public office.

* [[Magic]] - Not the playing cards, but the actual type that makes things disappear and can force you to have [[incest|sex with your sister]].

* Swords and Other Medieval-style Weaponry - This is because most fantasy authors are too lazy to move the plots out of the Dark Ages.

* Crazy Names - Fantasy names rarely have names like George or Allen, but instead use names like "Gandalf", "Phedre", "Theth'Roth", or "[[Cracky-chan]]".

==Notable Fantasy==

* ''[[Wheel Of Time]]'' <-- Fucking faggots that didn't include this should be shot for sucking tolkeins dick.
* ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''
* politicsforum
* [[Girlvinyl's Vagina]]
* [[Singularitarianism]]
