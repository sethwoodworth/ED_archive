A plot bunny is the [[furry|fursona]]-version of failed fanfic ideas that [[furfag|furfags]] fap to while thinking of MOAR fanfic ideas. Plot bunnies can usually be identified by a lack of [[originality]], [[win]], and usually end with the creator [[DELETING FUCKING EVERYTHING]] when they realize that they [[truth|fail at life.]] Plot bunnies are often done for [[fanfic]] writers who can't think of another way for [[Death Note|L to buttfuck Kira.]] 

[[Some argue|Many say]], that plot bunnies can be an excellent source of [[lulz]] and [[win]]. The general public has since refuted said offer because of the fact that [[truth|plot bunnies can produce no lulz]], as the creators are too busy fapping to gay porn of two imaginary characters to actually put more effort into said rodent other than 'L IZ LIKE A VAMPIRE AND LIGHT IS LIKE A HUNTER AND THEY HAVE SECKSSS!!11 FAV PLZ N COMMENT!'. 

It has been rumored that somewhere there are indeed good plot bunnies, but this notion is suffering from a lack of [[proof]], as [[No more than 99|99%]] of people looking for plot bunnies are either busy [[fap|fapping]] to [[Naruto|BAWWWruto]] [[fail|Shippuden]] or attention-whoring on [[deviantart]] to have enough intelligence to actually understand proper [[Engrish]], let alone any vague concept of originality or talent.
