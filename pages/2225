[[Godwin's Law]] is a prominent principle of [[Internet]] discussion(s) that is frequently demonstrated during spirited [[flame war|disputes]] that inevitably lead to one of the participants making a comparison between their opponent and [[Hitler]]. Debates of this sort are usually partaken by [[teenagers]] who know slightly less than [[fuck]]-all about history.

But wait! The tables have turned! Nazis have gained immense popularity amongst [[16 year old girls]] and they are proud to declare their beliefs in the face of [[fundamentalist|fundies]] who dare to oppose them. While [[deviantART]] in the past has been the center of much eye[[rape]] and soul torture, they have reached a new standard by combining their worst fandoms into a new genre characterized by depictions of [[furry|furries]] in [[incest|incestuous]] and/or [[yaoi|homosexual]] relationships with a swastika [[money shot|splatted]] somewhere in the picture.

==The Nazis of devianTART==
The most famous Nazis are usually the power-hungry [[mods]] such as [[Realitysquared]], [[Chix0r]] and [[Guruubii]]. [[Irony|Ironically]], it should be noted that whilst they may admire [[Hitler]] for his swift retribution for [[Jews|those who deserve it]] – they will also gleefully [[b&|ban]] both these fascist fangirls and the users who follow them around with the desire to throw them in an oven.

==Features==

[[Image:Nazi Sparkledog.jpg|thumb|300px|The world of a Nazi fangirl is full of sparkles and joy! [[^_^]].]]

In order to prove that they will not be bullied into submission by the [[emo|oversensitive]] [[sheeple]] who live under the delusion that the Nazis were [[gay|naughty]] men ([[BDSM|and not in a good way]]) most Nazi-lovin’ tartlets like to distance themselves to prove that they are [[retarded|unique]]. Here as some common traits.

*[[TheAmazingAtheist|A strong dislike of religion]]
*[[Irony|An equally strong admiration of Karl Marx]]
*A love of watching people die
*Followed by a [[butthurt]] speech on how just because they like the uniforms doesn’t mean they’re really sick sadists
*A deep-seated [[victim complex]] because of the above

===What Is Acceptable===
These will generate responses of <i>OMG KAWAII!!!11!one</i> and have hundreds of favorites and comments commending the owner of the picture.

* Drawing cute furry characters in Nazi uniforms
* Drawing cute anime characters in Nazi uniforms
* Drawing [[FYIAD|mythical creatures]] in Nazi uniforms
* Dressing in Nazi uniforms – but only if they happen to be [[anime]] characters
* Drawing [[gay]] pictures of [[Hitler]]
* Photographs of naked chicks with swastikas
* Photomanips of [[W|Bush]] as a Nazi
* Photomanips of the [[Pope]] as a Nazi
* Suggestions that the Nazis weren’t THAT bad

===What Isn’t Acceptable===
On the other hand these pictures will send the tartlets into a rampage on the evil of [[Germany|WWII]] either directed at the people in the picture or at the user stupid enough to post it.


* Photographs of Neo-Nazi gatherings
* Making Pro-Nazi stamps
* Making Anti-Nazi stamps
* Drawings of suffering [[Jews]]
* [[Jat777|Suggestions that the Nazis weren’t THAT bad]]


==Persecuting the Persecutors==

[[Image:DA Nazis screenshot.PNG|thumb|290px|Ve at [[deviantART]] do not approve of zis article...]]

Nazis on DA tend to believe that you should have to put up with them and not get offended at their Nazi-isms all around deviantART. Saying that you take offense to a Nazi hating [[Jews]], [[Niggers]] or [[Mexicans]] will get responses of "ZOMG POLITICAL PERSECUTION." No [[srs|seriously]]. The concept of Jews getting offended by swastikas is completely foreign to them. It simply does not compute. 

[[Troll| Trolling]] Nazis is considered rather easy on DeviantART. Although they typically defend their sick fetish to the death with millions of words they hardly understand ([[everyone |just like every other person on the internet]]), the Nazis always fail to realize that they have dug themselves in a hole when it comes to debating. This is due to them constantly asking for more freedom with their beliefs, but [[fail]] to see that their beliefs restrict freedoms.
===NihilSS===
Such is the case with the avatar of {{deviantart|nihilss|nihilSS}} (Shown below). nihilSS paraded around deviantART with that avatar for the better part of 6 months. Finally some [[kike]] named {{deviantart|OuroborosCobra|OuroborosCobra}} publicly stated in the [[Complaints Forum]] that her avatar offended him. He retaliated by making an icon just like hers only with a Star of David instead of the swastika. the result of this was one of the most lol worthy forum wars on deviantART in recent history. [[16 year old girls]] who fap over Obama and any other day would have chewed you out for making a racist joke joined the side of Nihilss because she is such a "nice Nazi" and all of the Jews and faggots and such joined OuroborosCobra. This forum war got so heated that they actually packed up all of their threads and moved and created a <S>[http://complaintopia.proboards.com/ totally new complaints forum]</S> '''(BALEETED!)''' where they could spout all the propaganda from a 90 year defunct political party they want without being [[Teruchan|oppressed by deviantART]]. nihilSS ended up getting banned for unrelated reasons, as can be read in her totally tl;dr [http://88-soldat.livejournal.com/628.html LiveJournal entry], but she has left a legacy of Nazi icons that will almost certainly be seen long after her stupid drama is forgotten.
