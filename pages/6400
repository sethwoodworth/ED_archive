An often ignored [[fact]] of [[reality]] used by [[troll]]s and [[scientist]]s to point out how [[time cube|YOU ARE EDUCATED STUPID]], physics <s>makes the internet go 'round.</s> measures how the internet goes 'round. It also helps you determine how long it'll take you to hit the ground after jumping out of an aeroplane with out a parachute.

==Explosives did WTC==
[[Everyone]] knows [[Jews did WTC]], but [[scientology|scientologists]] would have you believe that [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6545313046180631815 Government did WTC]. This is because they have a [[13 year old boy]]'s understanding of '''physics'''. The twin towers, they say, could not have fallen anywhere near terminal velocity. Therefore [[Chemistry|OMG EXPLOSIVES!]] You can see why this is [[stupid]] by conducting the following experiments.

==[[Fact]]s Exploited through Physics==
===Heavy things fall harder than light things===
Here is a science experiment you can try at home. Drop one marble on your head and have a [[friend]] measure the time it takes to hit your cranium. Now drop a bowling ball on your head and measure the time it takes to crack your skull. Both fall in the same amount of time, but one has a good chance of killing you.

===Jet fuel is hot===
If you have survived the previous experiment, try this one. Find a piece of wood, any size will do. Now, light that piece of wood on fire. Hold that peice of wood in your hand and time how long you can hold it. Now, soak a rag in kerosene and light that on fire. Again, time how long you can stand to hold it. Make sure you use your unburnt hand, as the previous hand will likely have nerve damage. You should find that one hand burned faster than the other. 

===Fast things hurt more than slow things===
As you are either dead or pretty much covered in cast, you will need a friend for this experiment. Call him. As he walks into your hospital room, throw a bullet at him. He will probably wonder why you did such a thing. This is because it didn't hurt. Then pull out your EPIC Desert Eagle and pop a cap in his ass. He will probably scream, bleed and try to kill you. This is because the bullet travelled much faster, and therefor, hurt moar. A WINNAR IS YOU!!!

==Other facts facts facts of physics==
===Computers rely on the flow of electrons through micro-transistors to function===
Self-explanatory really. [[Some argue]] that [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiZ-TqvVdGM&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fbulletin%2Emyspace%2Ecom%2Findex%2Ecfm%3Ffuseaction%3Dbulletin%2Eread%26messageID%3D1247609080%26Mytoken%3DAF0E51DF%2D1DCC%2D49DD%2DB9C computers rely on the flow of material through tubes].

The above is incorrect.  In fact, computers run on magic smoke.  This is evidenced by the fact that computers always cease to work when the magic smoke is released from them.

The above is [[Doing_it_wrong|incorrect]]. In [[fact]] [[computer]]s, like the [[internets]], run on [[tubes]]. This is evidenced by the fact that when you release the [[magic]] smoke by using a torch and some gasoline the [[internets]] do not disappear except to [[you]] because you are [[pwned|dead]].

===Higher up things fall harder than lower down things===
Imagine a [[girl|young lady]] standing on the roof of a house naked. If she throws a rock straight into the air and it lands on the man in the bushs masterb8ting to her it will hurt a lot more than if dropped from, say, the first floor window. This has to do with Newton's law which states that there are no girls on the [[internets]] so they must be standing on the roof, [[naked]].

===Magnets move things===

[[Some argue|Some people]] believe that [[Fuckin Magnets|magnets]] can control metal. This is false. Only Magneto can control metal. And the force. This is proven by the picture associated. Look tharr foar proofs.
[[Image:Magnet.png|thumb|300px|This chart is and ancient diagram showing how Obi-wan might use the force to control metals.]]

===Longcat is long===
Despite /b/ depictions, ||longcat||=∞.


===The [[Falcon Punch]]===

The Falcon Punch is the only known method of destroying physics other than [[dividing by 0]].



===Miscellania===
The arbitrary physical constants of the universe are the result of a freak chemical reaction which occured when Lowtax railed a bald eagle in the ass.

===Space===
Space is empty so objects keep on going, going and going until it hits something. This could be anything from a bag of dead babies too a ball of antimatter either way its gonna be a lot of work for the astrophysicists trying to determine why the fuck there is a bag of dead babies in space.
