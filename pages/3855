{{deviantart|IFavTrash|IFavTrash}} is a [[troll]] account on DeviantART that is devoted to, as the appropriate name explains, faving the ridiculous amount of trash found on the site.  It was started due to the user's frustration at clicking on [http://www.deviantart.com/random/deviation Random Deviation] and being showered with, not [[delicious]] artworks, but rather, [[shit]]astic doodles, [[camwhore|camwhorage]], and the rest of the [[AIDS]] that killed dA.

As of August 29, 2009; Ifavtrash decided to pussy out and quit his trolling career because, paraphrased, he "didn't want to be considered a stupid [[American]] like one of [[Encyclopedia_Dramatica|us]]".


==Mission==
IFavTrash hopes to affect change on devianTART by helping to [[DivineAngel|discourage]] [[chasethehedgehog|the]] [[Camelhijackation|posting]] of [[Bean|such]] [[AniutqaDA|garbage]] on the site in the first place.  The effectiveness of this method is questionable, as most of the people receiving a fave will probably be too [[stupid|dense]] to realize they are being insulted, and instead [[attention whore|glory in their increased favecount]].  In addition, the size of the resulting favorites gallery would surely be so large as to swiftly attract the dA [[banhammer]], if only to save the disk space wasted from hosting two separate and complete versions of the entire website.

IFavTrash was also started [[for the lulz]], since perusing [http://ifavtrash.deviantart.com/favourites/ the gallery of favorites] is quite funny (though also very, very sad).


==Reaction==
As expected, [[drama]] has already begun to ensue in response to IFavTrash.  [[Butthurt]] "[[art]]ists" come to baaaw in the comments, or else to make lame excuses like, [[lies|"I know it isn't art, I was just messing around!"]]  (Well, then, [[facepalm|don't post it up on deviant'''ART''']]).  Other people get all [[politically correct]] and spout, "[[OMG]], what if this account crushes the hopes and dreams of a young, aspiring artist and they become [[an hero]] in shame!!![[oneone|11]]". Because, you know, the [[13-year-old boy]] that worked so hard to doodle their [[Narutard]] [[OC]] on lined paper is totally going to one day sprout talent and become [[epic]]. And of course don't forget the most ridiculous response, "There's no such thing as bad art!1!!". Yeah, because Happy Tree Friends [[ship]]ping is comparable to Picasso. 

IFavTrash believes it is better to smash people's [[unrealistic expectations|dreams]] sooner, rather than later, and eventually spare us from having to look at so much [[crap]] on the internet.  Until then, we can [[lulz|point and laugh]] at all the trash that is faved.

==IFavTrash says==

Due to this article providing him so much [[attention whore|attention]] and tons of messages claiming "You are great, I support your fight", IFavTrash decided to post the "discussions" he has with the "[[an hero|artists]]", so people looking for [[drama]] won't bore looking for them through [[at least 100]] pages of useless comments.  [[Ironically]], these deviations fill deviantArt with exactly the kind of non-art that he claims to combat. But we forgive him for that because he brings the lulz.
