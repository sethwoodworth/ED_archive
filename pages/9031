Wiki Abuse

'''Wiki Abuse''' was a site that was created with the [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=9823&hl= mission of cataloging the actions of abusive administrators] on [[Wikipedia]], with the [[wiki]] [[Web 2.0]] twist of allowing [[anyone can edit|anybody to contribute]]. It was founded by [[Rootology]] on June 19, 2007, and in its first incarnation had the lifespan of a mayfly as a whiny-as-fuck attempt to own [[Bureaucratic Fuck|Wikipedia administrators]].  What Wikipedia loved most about it was that it was started by Rootology ([[ED]] admin [[User:Fuckface]]) who was not just banned, but ''[[Shit nobody cares about| banned by the Arbcom]],'' which is just like a regular ban except it takes [[Fred Bauder]] a month to fill out the paperwork. The site was taken down within a month with Rootology giving [[at least 100]] excuses. It is now deader than [[Andrewpants]].

==[[TL;DR|History]]==
===In the beginning...===
As a result of WikiAbuse's [[This is a wiki so I will vandalize it, thanks.|open-ended, contributor friendly environment]], the site was soon filled with bitchy diatribes about administrators nobody had ever heard of. It could've been on Wikimedia's MediaWiki [[spam]] blacklist within the hour except that it was too pussy to out any admins, and besides the [[Bureaucratic Fuck]]s slowly discovered that Rootology gave them an ideal habitat to extend their bullshit into. Rootology's fatal mistake was that he set up a context where he "assumed good faith" [[ROFL]] on the part of [[Bureaucratic Fucks]] and [[Wikipedo]]es who have displayed no good faith anywhere, giving them control of the whole fuckin' game. Don't do it again! 

A close second was that most of his nutcase [[Wikipedia Review]] "buddies" sat around totally [[butthurt]], whining about how the only contributors should be a "[[Cult|select membership]]" or "[[Waco|God's elite]]" (i.e. them), going wild about how Roots "no [[power word|outing]]s" policy was a sin, and raving on about their own "no [[power word|outing]]s" thing in the same breath. The rest of the time, most of them were fucking the site up in the same way as [[Grace Note]] and the Wikipedo admins. 

So, within a week of its creation, the site was simultaneously overrun by the glassy-eyed Wikipedia fanatics and WR loons, with both duking it out across a hundred different pages. With the only sysop (Rootology) asleep, the few other genuine editors fought a hopeless battle [[Undo|reverting]]. When he awoke, Rootology locked down the database in an attempt to regain control. 

===Goodbye cruel world===
Normally, a [[wikicide]] involves an editor, not an entire [[wiki]]. However, on July 12th [[Rootology]] announced that he had received "[[Legal action|credible legal threats]]" from the [[furluminati]] and would have to [[Final solution|shut down the site]].

There was a little more to the [[TL;DR]] [[Suicide#The_Note|suicide note]] but now it's gone (without a trace). It's all an obvious [[lie]], Root's "[[Pussy|Stop Outing of Bureaufucks at Any Cost]]" policy was there, and users followed it, so there was no basis for any [[e-lawyers]] to kick down his door.

===Back from the Grave===
[[Rootology]]'s first move after closing the site was trying to convince the [[batshit crazy|kooks]] on [[Wikipedia Review]] to buy the site name. [[Nathanr]] made a [[lame|half-hearted]] offer which his [[heart]] wasn't in. In the end they were all too busy [[Obsession|spending every waking hour watching Recent Changes on Wikipedia]] in between posting a lot of dull [[conspiracy theories]] about [[SlimVirgin]].

No one else was buying. Being a logical chap, Rootology decided to dig it up himself and do it all over again, but this time with [[Advertising|advertisements]] for [[profit]]!!1?!!!. These magically dissolved the alleged threat of [[legal action]] by financial friends of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. So, on December 10th, 2007, Wiki Abuse rose from the grave in a new [[zombie]] incarnation, featuring new policies, but with most of the old history and so on. One of the new policies is something called the [[Wikitruth]] model, presumably meaning it will only be updated every six months or so and all users will imply that they are actually [[Wikipedia Admin Gallery|Wikipedia administrators]]. As of the end of [[2007]], Wiki Abuse was updated less often than [[Maddox]]'s site. It soon disappeared altogether.

===Back to the Grave===
Wikiabuse is now just a [[troll]] for [[TOW]]'s [[42|meaning of life]] article.
