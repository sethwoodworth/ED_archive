Dr. Kevorkian is quite possibly the greatest [[IRL]] [[troll]] of the Supreme Courts. His [[epic]] [[lie|win]] resulted in the [[murder|liberation]] of 130 [[retards|people]], in what many claim to be the greatest opportunity of all time: a chance to do [[your mom]] a favor, and end your [[furfag|respectable]], [[basement_dwelling|noteworthy]], [[emo|joyous]]and [[pedo|proper]] life in the [[kill it with fire|safest and most humane way possible]]

[[Image:0_61_kevorkian_jack.jpg|thumb|..Now, is it just me, or does he look an awful lot like Mister Rogers here?]]

Ever since he has been imprisoned, the number of [[Emos]] and [[Goths]] living in the [[USA]] has risen by 3 times.  If only Dr. Kevorkian could help spread his love to all [[Emos]] and rid them of their emotional pain!  

Dr. Kevorkian's methods can be used to cure [[ETD|many common ailments]] such as:

* [[Living]]
* [[Emo]]
* [[Attention whore]]ism
* This shitty article
