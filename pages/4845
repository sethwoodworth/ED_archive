Life story
Any explanation of something that is [[TL;DR]].

== Your Life Story ==
An example of how to give your '''life story''' follows,
:John: "Hey Bill, how's it going?"
:Bill: "Pretty bad really, my wife's left me, my son is a [[furry]], and my daughter just got a Lexus off her [[Amazon]] [[wishlist]]."
:John: "Fuck, I didn't ask for your life story."

Giving somebody else's life story is just as easy,
:John: "Can you pass the French fries?"
:Bill: "Sure.  You know they were invented in Belguim."
:John: "I didn't ask for their life story, fuck."

Life stories inevitably contain a lot of ambient information, and are much like expository dialogue found in well-written books, plays, and movies.  Unfortunately, they all belong to people nobody listens to - this is why they feel compelled to tell their life story at the slightest hint that you might listen to it - and invariably the reason nobody listens to these people is because their life story is boring, pointless, and even depressing.

It is not ever worth listening to a life story.
