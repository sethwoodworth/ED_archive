'''The Bawls Kid''' (February 2, 1989 - August 7, 2007) is a [[meme]] surrounding an overweight [[teenager]] standing in front of loads of boxes of the popular energy drink, Bawls.  Nobody knows why the [[lusers]] who post this think it is funny, as there's nothing out of the ordinary about this pic other than the fact that the kid must really, really like his bawls.


==History==
Nobody really knows who the kid is, or where his bawls come from.  All we know is that at least [[100 years ago]] somebody posted a picture of a guy holding two bottles of bawls and standing proudly in front of some crates of bawls to [[7chan]].  Other /b/tards replied with one large [[lolwut]] and somebody named him the Bawls Kid.  It should have ended there, but in an attempt to [[forced meme|force]] the meme, they also posted it multiple times to [[4chan]].

==Roofies Scandal==
[[Last Thursday]] somebody who knows the Bawls Kid posted pics of the kid fondling the tits of a drunk [[slut]].  This was posted in reply to somebody bitching in a Bawls Kid thread with "[[tits or GTFO]]."  The thread then turned into a giant flamewar with other acquaintances posting about how they can't stand the Bawls Kid and that he's a creepy [[fuck]].  It was eventually revealed that the dumb [[slut]] was a [[camwhore]] named Anna.


==Trivia==
[[User:ItsNotLupus|ItsNotLupus]] claims to be the fatty featured in this shitty forced meme.
