'''Durova''' (nadezhda.durova@gmail.com), <b>'powerword' Lisa Broer</b>, is a former administrator on the English Wikipedia. She is a wikipedia [[lesbian]] and like her cross-dressing hero, Joan of Arc, Durova donned pants and joined the military. However, many people are unaware of Wikipedia's expanding military branches and often confuse it with the actual military of which she is not a part of.

Dresbian lost her adminship in disgrace after compiling a [http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Durova%27s_Sekret_Evidence "report"] on how to spot sockpuppets that a three-year-old would have seen through, and using it to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=&page=User%3A%21%21 block one of Wikipedia's best editors] as an abusive sock. Durova also stands accused of having caused congressional staffer Timothy Hill to lose his job, after making ''false claims'' that he was doing something wrong (he wasn't).  

This leading to a false-premise House Ethics investigation because of ''(yet another) knee-jerk accusation''.  ''Ah, Lise, Lise, Lise....''  Once this was brought to her attention, she with great haste called her three bumboys [[Crum375]] (er, bum-girl), [[JzG]], and [[MONGO]] to remove all traces of the stalking allegation from Wikipedia.

=== Bio ===

Durova was born [http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/hivemind.html September 10, 1968] which makes her 42 at the time of this writing. She lives in San Diego possibly in Chula Vista and has previously lived in Valencia and Pasadena, but always in California. She lives in California so that she can have no trouble getting laid looking like a 28 year old. Contrary to popular belief Durova does not look 28 or really of any age in the thirties; she looks like a disgusting pig who edits wikipedia and never sees the sun. She is a cross dressing lesbian with 40 years worth of penis envy built up and tends to be a raging bulldyke with no dates on a Friday night, <b>ever</b>. She received a film degree from Columbia proving that anyone can graduate as long as they set their standards low enough, however, she didn't set them correctly so she failed to complete her masters. She enjoys skating which is impossible because dykes can't balance anything and can't stop herself from taking pictures of things that aren't her face. She is also a [http://www.topmudsites.com/article32.shtml MUDD enthusiast] who plays [[furry|Zoo World]] all day and all night.[http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=29175]. She is a giant hypocrite with no control over her emotions and can't settle on a complete answer for anything.

She secretly desires wiki immortality and, unfortunately, got it in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Bergstein Brian Bergstein] AP/New York Times article where she was featured as a Talented-and-Fascinating Wikipedia Adminstrator. This shows that the media is blind to the evils of the secret cabal. She is also willing to settle for a reality show date with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Federline Kevin Federline] because being gay and obnoxious should put you in the company of the world's greatest faggot. 

She is "famous" for a number of things, mostly her batshit behavior, but some of her endeavors go beyond her normal twatery. She is known for obsessively [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc&diff=116949066&oldid=116632691 editing historical women who cross-dressed and also served in the military] like editing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc Joan of Arc]  and editing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durova Nadezhda Durova] (oh yes, there is a difference between regular cross-dressing and military cross-dressing). Durova created a special category for this in Wikipedia. What has gotten her the most attention here is of course her nazi cabal tactics of banning people for just looking at her the wrong way. Online.

The absurdity doesn't cease there though. She conducts "Wikipedia Investigations" which since she doesn't have checkuser status, means she just makes shit up. In 2007 she was forced to resign for this, when she banned a random editor, paranoically believing they were a sleeper account belonging to [[Wikipedia Review]].

== [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Arkhamite Arhkamite]==

Durova got [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Arkhamite User:Arkhamite] banned from Wikipedia for disagreeing with her, by falsely claiming that Arkhamite was a mental patient.  Did he behave badly?  Sure.  Were the horrible defaming things she  wrote about him true?  NO.

'''What really happened?'''
::'''NEWBIE EDITS''' - He got on her bad side - Arkhamite [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arkhamite&diff=prev&oldid=109574333 irritated a few old timers with his newbie edits and deletions].
::'''NOSY QUESTIONS re: Durova and Cross-dressing military girls''' - He made the mistake of editing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc Joan of Arc], and asking Durova too many questions, like, "why do you always write about cross-dressing women". To make matters worse, he started questioning her God-given faith in Joan of Arc (like wondering if Joan of Arc was psychotic rather than sainted).  The gloves came off.  She sniped, he responded.
::'''DUROVA'S POWER TRIP''' - After a few back-and-forth exchanges, over several months, things had deteriorated.  Sick of Durova's constant blocks and threats, Arkhamite [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Arkhamite&diff=prev&oldid=120711513  provoked Durova by calling her a lesbo on his talk page] (and by raising questions as to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_of_Arc&diff=116949066&oldid=116632691 Durova’s need to write about cross-dressing military women in history]
::'''FINAL STRAW''' - The worst thing that Arkhamite did was to   [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Joan_of_Arc&diff=prev&oldid=120392290 imply that Durova was sexually obsessed with Joan of Arc].   

[[File:Arkhamiteban.png|thumb|center|650px|<center>Arkhamite brings the funny after being harassed too many times by the angry dyke.</center>]]

'''What did she do?'''
::'''ALLEGED HE WAS SEXUALLY FIXATED''' (without really saying what that was).  Presumably it concerned asking her about her fascination with cross-dressing women in military history.
::'''CLAIMED HE THREATENED HER'''... Durova said he had threatened her with deep dungeons and hellfire (or something) which sounds weird, except for that she had threatened him (jokingly, when they were getting along) with WP:DAMNATION.
:: '''CLAIMED HE WAS A MENTAL HOSPITAL REFUGEE''' Durova claimed that Arkhamite had been an "self-admitted mental patient" making reference to a passage on his user page. Quote: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Community_sanction_noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=121901324 ''Committed to Arkham asylum in October 2000 after defying a police officer '' ]
::'''Wait - Isn't that a hospital in a Batman Comic??''' Yes. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_Asylum Arkham Asylum] is a fictional asylum for the criminally insane from the Batman comic books. (Arkhamite was given to editing about DC Comics; the information on his user page was in jest)  

'''So in other words, '''Durova was running around saying that Arkhamite was a former inmate in an imaginary asylum from a Batman comic book?. (Explain to me please which person was crazy, again?) And if he really *had* emotional issues (which we aren't implying he had, though the possibility exists that he chose his username because he actually has been diagnosed as insane, and has been involuntarily hospitalized at least <S>twice</S> <S>five</S> six times) isn't this the kind of thing that would send someone over the edge or onto one year of mental health probation? To add insult to injury not one of the unanimous voters on the ban noticed that Durova ‘just made shit up’. OK - just one.  Dan Beale had the good sense to tell Durova that about her comments, 

Comment: '''"This person also has a self-confessed inpatient psychiatric history." - [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Community_sanction_noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=121901324 How is this relevant to whether an editor should or should not be banned / blocked? The problem is poor behaviour, not the psychiatric history. Dan Beale 09:28, 11 April 2007 (UTC)"].''' 

Amen.  Behave yourself, Durova.

Greg Kohs was an unsuspecting entrepreneur trying to make a bit of money by helping businesses get on Wikipedia site, for a small fee. Greg starts to get harassed before [[Jimbo Wales]] finally notices what he is doing and throws a tantrum. At this point the Wikipedia community bans him but then Wales finally does a courtesy reinstatement. Durova then made false claims that Greg Kohs had lied to New York Times reporter Brian Bergstein, on Wikipedia. When Kohs asked her for evidence of her defamatory comments, Durova accused him of making a legal threat (by using the word 'defamatory'), and had him banned without due process - two days after he'd been reinstated. Durova then continues to follow Greg Kohs to various web pages as an attacker all while making reference to the ban that she carried out using false information. Greg is incongruously nice to Durova, continuing to point out that he has no intention to sue her.

:: Seriously, I don't want to do battle with you. You're a very accomplished editor of Wikipedia. I respect that very much. I just wish you wouldn't have said that I lie to journalists (in so many words); but now that it's out there, I can only wish that you'd redact it, or at least modify it enough to where we could both accept the statement. For example, "In my opinion as Durova, Gregory Kohs didn't disclose everything about his subsequent participation in Wikipedia that he could have disclosed to AP reporter Brian Bergstein. Admittedly, Bergstein has indicated that this information wasn't relevant to the story he wrote, but I feel that it does speak to Mr. Kohs' incomplete portrayal of his experiences on Wikipedia." Could you live with that? I could. I know it's a lot more wordy than "He gave misleading information to journalists"; but I contend that "failing to disclose all possible information" is quite different than "giving misleading information", and I likewise see a difference between "Brian Bergstein" (in the singular) and "journalists" (in the plural).[[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Thekohser&diff=next&oldid=145931414]

*Apparently, Durova's been sending him unwanted emails, suggesting that this-or-that Wikipedia editor is naughty.
*Rumor has it he autodeletes these emails.  

==== Little Lise Finally Gets Some Much Needed Attention (Searchengineland.com) ====
*Despite having been brow-beaten by Durova, Jessica Bowman gracefully allowed her to write an article on SEO, entitled, [http://searchengineland.com/070717-113550.php "SEO Tips and Tactics From an Insider"].  
*(What this means) - After months of sucking up to reporters and editors, one of her annoying, (sociopathically) hypocritical, preachy articles finally gets published
*The advice is good, um, '''IF AND ONLY IF''' you want to spend half your business time sucking up to her, after she PWNS you for admitting COI, as she recommends.
*CAVEAT: Once she has you on her COI list, one false move and she'll ban your butt and brand your firm with all the negativity housed in her tiny soul.

===  1. DUROVA ON MUDD: From Outcast Cow to Successful Executioner===
''Note: This essay won Durova a third place prize on the materiamagica website.  Please note the poetic congruence with her career as an abusive Wikipedia administrator, with "Durova's" life as an executioner...''

::''About twenty years ago Zog the arch-wizard fell head over long grey beard in love with a Swedish milkmaid. She thought he  looked silly and told jokes about him. So Zog took revenge as only a wizard can. There was a fine black angus bull at the next farm...a very fine bull. One love potion and a few spells later, Durova the minotaur was born. Durova didn't fit in very well with human or with cow society. Grazing gave her a sore neck. Humans feared her. Her mother's  village hired her as executioner. Finally she had a place in the world. Crime dropped to almost nothing. Villages for miles around would pay her to stand in the town square with an axe as a warning to citizens. Durova's life was good. Then tragedy struck. Durova's town elders served her father at a banquet. She went on a rampage of revenge. Cows everywhere mooed. People cried. Durova was an outcast once again. So Durova set out for Alyria, a world filled creatures even stranger than she''...[http://web.archive.org/web/*hh_/durova.com/robots.txt Ref: Materiamagica]

=== 2. LETTER TO SAN DIEGO UNION TRIBUNE EDITOR: I Hate People with Nice Houses ===

::'''No tax 'bailout' for wealthy landslide victims''' -  

::''It's very hard to feel sorry for millionaires who choose to live in a known landslide area ("Laguna Landslide," News, June 2). I hope my tax dollars go toward schools and police, not bailouts for the wealthy. While no location is completely safe from natural disaster, let's not rationalize and pretend that all risks are equal. It doesn't take much common sense to look at an eroding seaside hill and see exceptional danger. These are people who had the means to live anywhere they wanted. What would the extra homeowner's insurance have cost them, one less vacation to Maui? A smaller plasma TV? When disaster strikes the helpless I am full of compassion. My heart goes out to the victims of last winter's tsunami. My laughter goes out to (those affected by) the Laguna Beach landslide. But a fool and his money are soon parted.''[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050607/news_lz1e7letters.html Ref: San Diego Union Tribune]

=== 3. THE DARK SIDE: How to Ruin your Business on Wikipedia...With Bans ===

::'''Cautionary 'Wikisleuthing'

::''Let's face facts: Wikipedia has become an important force on the Internet. If you've got a business to run or a belief to circulate there's a big temptation to hit that edit button and do your thing. You're on your honor here. Most people have honor, which is why Wikipedia is huge and (usually) pretty darn good, but then there's that thought - what if you could harness this site and make it work for you? You aren't the first person to get that idea. And hello there, I was a Wikipedia administrator.''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Durova/The_dark_side Ref: Userspace wikipage]
