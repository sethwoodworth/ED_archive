[[File:Jokesoup.jpg|thumb|200px|center]]


An "'''in-joke'''" is one which three or fewer people understand, and forms the bedrock of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].

For example, an ordinary joke might be as follows;

Q. Why did the chicken cross the road?<br/>
A. To get to the other side

whereas an in-joke might be;

Q. Why did the chicken cross the road?<br/>
A. Because of a point mutation in the gene coding for its sinal magnetite receptor.<br/><br/>

In-jokes can be distinguished from unfunny jokes (see [[GET OUT]]) or surreal jokes ...

Q. What's black and white and red all over?<br/>
A. A gooseberry in a lift.

... in that at least other other person, possibly in a [[anonymous|covert organisation]] or a  [[cult]], gets the joke and then laughs at it.
