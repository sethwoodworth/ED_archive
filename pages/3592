'''''[[Halo]]''''' , also known as Gaylo and Failo, is an overrated, overhyped [[FPS]] game with outdated controls, terrible graphics, and a convoluted storyline that was once considered "good" only because most gamers have never opened a book. The online multiplayer is scientifically designed to get on your nerves. The storyline also ripped off some shitty 1970's book called 'Ringworld', that [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody cared about]], and also ripped off vehicles, designs, and Sgt. Apone (Johnson) from Aliens, which everyone did care about. The game was credited for saving [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox]] from going straight down the drain because at the time, it was the only reason anyone would have wanted one. The official website for gay banana split Halo fans is [[Bungie.net]], a gay banana website. 

==Halo 1.0==
The original ''Halo'' was known for being the only good [[Xbox]] game that wasn't available on [[Playstation 2]] or the [[GameCube]] or [[Dreamcast]].
It received [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5bu5YMzyPU extremely good] reviews from every major publication thanks to its fantabulous level design that repeated the same Goddamn gray corridor every 30 feet, which cut loading times. And as if the repetition wasn't bad enough, halfway through the game, you get to play through each level BACKWARDS!

The original story involved the [[Pretty cool guy|Master Chef]], a 26th century [[300|Spartan]], and excellent cook, killing a bunch of aliens and stopping a giant ring in outer space from fuckinga up everyone's shit, thus saving world/universe/day/whatever. 

It was also notable for having a handgun that could [[headshot]] people from literally half a mile away. Any multiplayer game became a chorus of [[Butthurt|moans and profanity]] as just getting with 500 yards of a competent player (lol, paradox) resulted in instant death. 

Unfortunately, the game sold a fuckload and singlehandedly saved the [[Xbox]] from going the way of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|Dreamcast]].

==Halo 2==
[[Image:Needler 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Goatse]]?]]

Like any somewhat decent game that makes a lot of money, the designers had to [[FUBAR|fuck it up beyond all recognition]]. They took every redeeming quality of the original and raped it like [[Pedobear]] in a roomful of [[Loli|loli]] after being starved of [[CP]] for 3 weeks. The graphics were glitchy, the physics were inconsistent, the weapons were [[shit]], well...yeah, and the levels were...well they stayed at about the same level of shittiness. [[Irony|Ironically]], the game solda even [[moar]] than the first, and millions of [[fucktard]]s blindly embraced it as a gift from [[God]].

The story was also borderline [[retard]]ed and riddled with plot holes, like how the Covenant somehow find Earth and (conveniently) a brand new Halo ring, or like how they just randomly throw in the Venus Fly Trap from the ''Little Shop of Horrors'' halfway into the game.

''Halo 2'' also introduced a new playable character - The Arbiter, a Covenant Elite warrior [[you have no friends|shunned by his people]] and blah blah blah, [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody really cares]].

We also get introduced to Miranda Keyes, who's the daughter of that captain dude from the first game, the High Prophets: Truth, Mercy & Regret (who look suspiciously like turkeys), the aforementioned venus fly trap Gravemind, and the Brutes, led by their Chieftain, Tartarus, who  is a big-ass bondage loving furry from Hell.

''Halo 2'' was the first game that you could play over the internets, via Xbox Live. Of course, the funny thing about having a design team of [[over 9000]] [[CSIII]] graduates is that not everyone knows what everyone else is doing. This leads to a lot of interesting problems that [[basement dweller|basement dwellers]] (or in some cases, [[trolls]]) can find and exploit, like people being able to lunge at someone with the sword from a mile away, being able to drop through the ground, being able to bounce 2,000 feet into the air, and being able to lag everyone into next week, while you go around and rape the other team. As such, [[at least 100]] patches have been released trying to fix the broken and obviously retarded multiplayer. Though even without the glitches, any normal human can only take the unbalanced weaponry, the high-pitched screams of [[13 year old boy|prepubescent boys]], and sheer lack of entertainment for so long.

It did, however have the best rocketa launchera of the three games, since it could seek, and allowed you to dual wield needlers for epic win.

[[TL;DR]]: Halo 2 is an expansion pack to Halo that didn't add anything except the ability to hold [[ALL CAPS|TWO WEAPONS]]!!!

==Halo PC==
A shitty port of ''Halo'' to the PC. Despite the dated graphics, you only needed a "[[Shit|high-end]]" PC to run it decently. The only reason you would want to play ''Halo PC'' is for the single-player campaign, as the multiplayer is complete ass. No votekick, no voice chat (well, in ''Halo'''s case that might be a good thing), laggy shitty ass online play (you have to aim five feet ahead of an enemy to register a hit), and a community of fucktards ("lol n00b pwned xD"). Not only that, but 99% of all the fucking servers are fucking rockets on Blood Gulch or Battle Creek.(Not to mention they hack like a bitch.)

==Halo 2 Vista==
A shitty port of ''Halo 2'' to the PC. It was exactly the same as ''Halo 2'' for the Xbox, except it has [[lie|better graphics]] and a [[shit nobody cares about|map editor]]. To get the ability to play a three year old Xbox game, all you have to do is [[fail|downgrade]] to [[Vista]]. Anyone who is [[retarded|stupid]] enough to buy this should become [[an halo]].

''Halo 2 Vista'' was also the first game in Microsoft's attempt to [[Shit|consolize]] PC gaming, "Gays For Windows". Apparently MS thinks it's a great idea to Jew Fail marketing ploy was fail.

==Halo 1.5 (or 3)==
And just in case you managed to avoid that spoilers, Johnson dies. But black people always die in [[movies]] and [[Video games|videogames]].  That one white commander [[woman]] dies, too, because it's a well-known fact that [[women]] [[suck]] at [[Cock|videogames]].  

Even though ''Halo 2'' was more popular than [[Jesus]], the [[Retards|designers]] [http://www.gamespot.com/news/6164579.html?sid=6164579&page=16| admitted] that it was a broken pile of [[fail]] and [[AIDS]]. While ''Halo 3'' is still made of fail, it is still better than that rancid collection of squirrel dung, ''Halo 2'' (If only slightly).

Bungie isn't exactly known for innovation, as the game still has the same boring controls as it did in [[2001]].

Graphics-wise, it looks EXACTLY like ''Halo 2'', except that its [[Over 9000]] times brighter , and a big, fat layer of [[lens flare]] thrown over everything.

By the final installment of the trilogy, you would think the story couldn't possibly get any more butchered...right? [[wrong|WRONG!!]] There are so many plot holes and random shit happening that you'll most likely be forced to throw the whole thing out the window. For example: How did Gravemind find Earth? Why did MC just randomly jump off Truth's ship entering Earth... was it just for the lulz? How did ''High Charity'' manage to find the Ark's SECRET location?

But hey, [[nobody cares]] about the story anymore, it's all about [[Shit|teh awesomez flawless online multiplayer]].

The Xbox Live multiplayer is exactly the same pile of horse manure as ''Halo 2'''s online, with the sole exception of a half-assed map editor with which you can't even edit the terrain or add all the objects. The maps and games all [[AVGN|suck baboon balls]]. And when you play matchmaking, once you go in to a game, you can't leave. So much like a visit from a rapist, no matter how much you kick and scream, [[rape|it's gonna happen]], and there's nothing you can do about it.

Another [[fail|totally awesome]] addition to the third installation of the Halo series is the ability to take [[Screencap|screenshots]]. This is about the only new thing Bungie has to offer. Motherfucking screenshots. [[You]] can only imagine [[basement dweller|what kind of people actually utilize this feature]].

To prove that Halo sucks more cock than a whore on Viagra, a cave-dwelling little [[Azn]] decided to record himself annoying the typical Halo player (see above). [http://www.youtube.com/user/HaloFuntage]

==Halo Wars==
Halo Wars is a [[gay|faptastic]] RTS which is usually too [[Lie|difficult]] for the remaining [[Pie|95%]] of the Xbox [[retards|Population,]] even though is the simplest, dumbed down RTS game currently out on any system.
In Early 2009, due to [[Microsoft|Microshits]] awesome [[BDSM|partnership program]], they [[raped|dumped]] Ensemble Studios ass and left them to die in the burning depths of hell and faggotry.

Overall, the [[fags|developers]] got [[raped|kicked]] in the arse and the game was overall [[shit]]...unless of course, you weren't like the rest of the [[faggot]] population of xbox live and actually [[rage|HAD A FUCKIN BRAIN]]

===Gameplay===
The gameplay of almost every match consists solely of spamming specific types of units and initiating the all powerful [[Zerg Rush]]. There are no real strategies to the game and no point in trying to do anything unique or even trying to use some level of skill. Communication is restricted to Xbox Microphone, and considering all the [[Children|Players]] are usually too stupid to talk even if they have a mic, there is no point even plugging in yours and no way to Cooperate with teammates.

Not only does the actual gameplay suck, but Halo Wars features a broken, unsophisticated matchmaking system that often matches up [[noob]]s with high ranked [[assholes]] who play the game too much, resulting in most players getting pissed off, quiting games, and sending messages to the gamers they lose to. Not only this, but the matchmaking often matches up multiple [[faggot]] little [[children]] together playing the same unit. Because they are lazy fucktards with no mics, they both choose to make the same exact units, often leading to hell hole 3v3 games when you play by (or with) yourself in standard 3v3 games.

===Downloadable Content===
After the game shipped on [[WTC|who the fuck cares]] day, fans were very [[pussy|hostile]] about the game not getting any updates or planned [[gimmick|Downloadable Content]], since the developer was fucking dead!

'''Gametypes'''
Eventually, some random assholes released DLC for Halo wars, and it sucked dick! The first DLC was game types. That's right mother fucker, game types. $10.00 hard earned dollars that you could spend on [[win|porn]], Microsoft expects you to pay to buy [[fail|GAME TYPES]] with. For [[dumbass]]es who do not know what this means... [[all_caps|GAMETYPES SHOULD BE FUCKING FREE]]. If you actually bought these, you have absolutely no FUCKING BRAINS.

'''Maps'''
[[Rage|Maps were eventually released for Halo Wars, and although not as big as a ripoff as the gametypes, they are still full of shit for their price tag. Those who actually bought the maps don't get matched up with anyone who owns them because no one owns them, because (once again) FAGGOT LITTLE]] [[thirteen_year_old_boy|CHILDREN]] [[rage|who have no BALLS infest the game like Captain Cutters bullshit ODST units. They don't have credit cards or money, only time to waste aggravating adults.]]

==Halo 3: ODST==
[[Image:Odst.png|thumb|All New Campaign - Same Shitty Game!]]
Halo 3: ODST is the latest offering of milk from the Halo cow. Bungie, like all other game companies, wanted to release an expansion pack as full priced games because they are assholes and bitches of [[Microsoft]].  Worried that the cocaine pile was getting low they set to work on a disc that's nothing more than a half-assed expansion based on the already half-assed Halo 3 game. It's a mini campaign complete with maps to a game you already bought. 
<center><big>'''hoy meets boy'''</big></center><br>
<center><youtube>59P6mN1JSsE</youtube></center><br>

===Story===
You play as an OD<b>STD</b> [[FAIL|(Orgasmic Dick Sucking Transsexual dumbass)]] soldier. A regular, plain old boring ass human with no spartan super powers. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? No over shields, you die easy, you are a dime a dozen soldier, etc. Oh yea, the story line is also some random shit Bungie pulled out of their assholes. It has absolutely nothing to do with the books or anything. They just wanted to make more money so they added a random story line before the events of Halo 3. And since Bungie didnt write the books and no one ever read them, who the fuck cares anyway?

===Characters===
*'''Rookie Cookie''': Some mute trying to be like Gordon Freeman, he thinks he's awesome but he's not.
*'''Captain 'I DARE YOU'''': A random bitch who leads the squad. Raped the guy below and took his position, now she's the leader and tells a lot of men what to do.
*'''Edward 'I just bucked you':''' The who does Malcom Reynolds from [[Firefly]]. The retard who lead the team before, had to give up his position to the bitch above for sucking so much. Fussed with Dare in the ship's crewberths, Dare pushed him on the bed to calm him down, and raped him. She had some hidden hypnotizing makeup on, now she makes him believe that she's the leader. One point later in the game, Dare fucks him right infront of the Rookie and Vergil.
*'''Dutchland:''' Some Dutch maniac who just wanted to be an ODST because he felt like it.
*'''African Lil' Romeo:''' Lil' Romeo's stupid African nigger dad, wants to be cool with the bitches, but they tell him to back off.
*'''ODST Mickey Mouse:''' Mickey Mouse decided to be Mickey Man, now he ended up like this and lost his ears. Was lowest ranked because he sucked so much.
*'''Sgt. Johnson:''' The cool nigga we always know and hated from the other games. Only in Firefight, to scared to show himself in Campaign cuz people would be freaked to see he's the twin brother of the one of Delta Halo. 
*'''Stupid Intendent(more like Shitty Intendent)/Vergil Hawkins from Static Shock:''' Static Shock tripped himself into another universe, and ended up as the whole city himself. When Dare and Rookie found him, he was turned into an alien. He and Rookie watched Dare and Buck fuck eachother in the elevator.
*'''You:''' The retard who spent 80 bucks on a game about faggots tea-bagging each other.

===Graphics, HUD, and Sounds (technical shit)===
Halo 3: ODST runs off the same shitty engine that powered Halo 3. The graphics still suck and the controls are still outdated. Also, the HUD is retarded, giving you these stupid night vision mode goggles and other random stupid bullshit that is unnecessary in the Halo Universe. What ever happened to the good old flashlight like in Combat Evolved? The sounds are also shitty, replicating the annoying sounds of the covenant weapons, the annoying battle rifle, and the annoying covenant vehicles. Also, Halo 3: ODST re-uses a lot of the generic, very OLD Halo theme song with a couple of new instruments added. Same shit as Halo Wars and the Halo FPS sequels.

===Online Mode===
Halo 3: ODST comes with all the maps the original Halo 3 came with plus all the shitty Halo 3 maps you already paid for. That's right, you're paying for the same shit twice(or in my case....7 times). Let's not forget how crappy the Halo 3 maps were, either! Oh yea, but it does give you THREE NEW MAPS on top of the others, so you don't feel like a complete [[douchebag]] for wasting $60.00 on the same shit. Besides that, there's this stupid new Co-op mode called Fucker-fight. You have to fuck your enemies, and survive as long as you can.

'''TL;DR''': It's Halo 3 with more lens flare, no dual wielding and you take [[Rape|Fall damage.]]

Should you try playing the Matchmaking mode, this is what will inevitably be your experience:

First, you select your playlist, and by playlist I mean Rumble Pit or Social Slayer. Nobody plays the [[Shit nobody cares about|objective-based games]], except for [[13-year-old boys]] who play Action Sack for the [[stupid|HILARIOUS]] name. Several minutes will pass as it searches for a game, finds nine of the ten players required to play and then restarts its search.

When you do find a match, you will find that you have walked into a pointless [[swearing|argument]] between a stupid black person and a stupid [[wigger]], who also happen to be your teammates. You can mute them, but as annoying as they are, nigger/wigger arguments have extremely high potential for lulz.
If you crave disappointment, you can check to see the shitty map and game type you'll play and try to veto it, which will either [[fail]] or result in an even [[epic fail|shittier map and game type.]]

Finally, the game starts. The other team, who has already formulated a plan with several phases, will spawn near the power weapons and take them within thirty seconds. Your team, composed of [[you]], a nigger who claims to have committed various [[Church of Fudge|debauched sexual acts]] with [[your mom]], a wigger who, despite having the same personality and sexual history with your mom as the nigger, is diametrically opposed to everything he stands for, and a four year-old boy who says his balls "[[lolwut|dropped in your mothers mouth]]". You are fucked.

Your team (Blue, most likely) will waste no time in dropping their Battle Rifles for [[shit|dual magnums]] and rushing the enemy base, keeping as much space between them as possible. The Red Team scores twenty points in five minutes. When you make a pitiful attempt to score a point, you will either be [[rape|raped]] by every member of the other team, get killed by three Needler rounds or get run over by a Ghost piloted by a [[faggot|member of your team]] [[retard|who was too busy trying to eat his controller to see what he was doing.]]

Finally, the nigger quits, enraged that the wigger called him [[gay]] after the thirty-sixth time he told the wigger to [[gay|suck his dick or balls/eat his ass.]] Soon after, [[rape|Red Team wins 50 to 13.]]

A common misconception is that you are always playing against humans who cheat. This is not true. Your teammates and enemies are actually bots, because people realized long ago that [[true|Halo is shit]] and [[lie|stopped playing it.]] This is why, regardless of the levels of either team's players, your allies always play [[buttsex|the same.]] Even if your enemies are privates and your team is made entirely of generals, everyone on your team will [[rimjob|suck ass]]. [[BAW|Dead babies play Halo better than a Rank 4 General on your team.]]

'''TANK>Everything'''


Oh no! Not another one! Set about a day before the first game, which is apparently [[retard|before humans/covenant realised they could hold two weapons at once!!!!!1]](OMG WTF!) Halo Reach lets you experience the raping of Reach firsthand, over the course of which the Covanent decided [[retard|it was a good idea to land on the planet first and then go back to their spaceships to shoot their deathrays when they could have done that before they landed]]

Halofags are excited because now they can use jetpacks!!!1! (As if Gaylo wasn't gimmicky enough) And CODfags say that armor abilities are copying perks, and it's true, but no one gives a shit because COD stole from Halo, and Halo stole from just about everywhere else.

Also included in Reacharound is the ability to make maps, called Forge World. This allows 13 year-old boys to create all sorts of fuck-ups and sorry excuses for levels. Of course, if you're playing Gaylo in the first place, you don't have the attention span to build an argument, let alone a map (says the SDF tard that thinks ModNation Racers is better).

[[Shit nobody cares about|BUT HOLY FUCKING SHIT YOU CAN DRIVE A FORKLIFT TRUCK!!!!!]]
'''TL;DR''' Halo ODST and COD:MW2

== Characters of Reacharound ==
*'''Carter''': No nonsense [[Guido|Douchebag]]. Leader of [[Retards|Noble Team]]. He dies because he [[an hero|an heros]] for your miserable life by [[9/11|crashing his pelican dropship into a Scarab.]]

*'''Kat''': Some bitch who likes to touch and hax everything, lost her right arm because she gave Carter a handjob and he came on her face. She dies by getting shot by a needle rifle round. Lulz. After she dies, [[you]] decide to drag her body off the battlefield for [[necrophilia|later use]]. When Reach first [[came]] out, snapshots of her ass were always at the top of the "Top Downloads" list, which is not surprising given that the average Halofag spends too much time in the basement to talk women and also fucks there sister.

*'''Jun''': Bald guy with a [[France|weirdass accent]] and who loves to shoot at rocks. Jun has the shooting ability of an autistic 5 year old retarded monkey who just did 20 kilo's of cocaine and then fucked his sister. Went off with Halsey and [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody knows where or what has happened to him.]]

*'''Emile''': black person with a cool skull helmet and [[Dildo|knife]]. Gets stabbed by an Elite with an energy sword.

*'''Jorge''': Big-ass bearded guy with big-ass gun. Will [[internet toughguy|fuck you up]]. Kills himself in Covenant ship to save Reach by blowing it up, but more, even larger ships came like an endless swarm of [[nigras]].

*'''Noble Six''': [[You]], Talks less than a mute retard. Gang raped by [[dinosaurs|elites]] at the end.

==Weapons==
With each passing halo game comes [[shit|brand new exciting weapons]] so Bungie can actually look like they are doing something. You have a wide variety of faggoty weapons, equipment and grenades. Each weapon in Reacharound looks exactly like weapons in the last 500 Halo games, only they suck more cock.

===Human Weapons and equipment===
They are preferred the most because we like rooting for the home team.
*'''The Assault Rifle (GayR):''' This was first to arrive in Halo 1, but no one used it due to the 1337 pistol. [[Shit nobody cares about|Because nobody used it]], it was omitted from Halo 2. [[Baw|Fan boys complained, however, and it arrived back in Halo 3 to not be used again]].

*'''Magnum:'''  '''THE''' greatest weapon in gaming history. In Halo 1, the pistol killed you faster than you could say [[Rage|"FUUUU"]], and if you looked at it hard enough, [[LOL WUT|it grew a scope]]. It was used in every Halo game after, but it sucked dick because of the BR. No the BR sucks dick to.

*'''Battle Rifle (1337 4 SH0T!):''' [[Fox News|The most fair and balanced]] weapon in the game. This weapon is why every player in Halo is so gay when in comes to camping/non MLG game types. [[Shit nobody cares about|They think strategic playing is only using a weapon that kills in 4 shots to the head. They fail to realize that there is no strategy involved in Halo, only skill]]. This is why they end up getting pwned by the guy with a shotgun and bawing about it. 

*'''Sniper Rifle (Camping Rifle):''' [[Truth|Don't know how to melee/BR/use grenades/play in general? You're in luck because like every FPS, Halo has an over-powered sniper rifle! It is basically a semi-automatic with a 10x scope attached. If you use this weapon, you are nothing more than a camping faggot that has to hide behind his team and shoot from far away to get kills.]]

*'''Shotgun (Troll Rifle):''' Hated by every "pro" player in the game. Use this weapon as much as possible as a trolling method. Bonus points if you're in Team slayer and you get MVP by using nothing but it. Then proceed to shit talk the other team and your own in the lobby for sucking so much.
*'''SMG (Shitty Machine Gun):''' This weapon replaced the AR in Halo 2. It has a range of, like, -3 feet or something, and can be dual-weilded. Also sounds like a broken airsoft gun. Bonus points if you kill someone with overshields with a SMG-Plasma Rifle combo.

*'''Rocket Lawn Chair:''' What every team will be fighting for at the start of the game. Used only to kill yourself.
*'''Grenades:''' spam them as much as possible. '''Fun Fact:''' Grenades have done more friendly fire damage then regular damage in Halo 3.
*'''Spartan Laser [[Shoop Da Whoop|(SHOOP AND WHOOP)]]:''' No description needed.
*'''Turret:''' Another good way to troll MLG players. Boy they're whiny little bitches aren't they? 
*'''Flamethrower:''' A very good weapon because it gives you the satisfaction of [[Kill it with fire|KILLING IT WITH FIRE]].
*'''Melee:''' [[Falcon Punch|FALCON PAAAAWWWWNCH!!!]], [[lolwut|two punches does more damage than 30 bullets from an assault rifle]]
*'''Missile Pod:''' Perfect for getting rid of [[Bike|dat nigga who stole yo banshee]]. 
*'''Flag:''' [[unfunny|It's next to the headlight fluid]].
*'''Traffic Cone:''' [[LOL WUT|LOL WUT]]. Some serious shit, dont diss the trafic cone, it will '''FUCK YOU UP'''.

*'''Tripmine:''' Bound to make your enemies [[Rage|"FUUU"]]. Even though it is generally useless, you can sometimes get that double kill when you enemies are too blind and deaf to hear the warnings of the deadly tripmine. It's physically incapable of killing someone on foot but can still blow up a tank. If you see your teammate's mine, be sure to [[an hero]] and kick him [[for the lulz]], thus causing your team to lose because you're down one player. But that doesn't matter because kicking that guy was the funniest thing since [[9/11|WTC]].

*'''The Tea-Bag:''' [[Butthurt|As if this game wasn't gay enough, this weapon became the most commonly used weapon in the game, though not actually a weapon, it allows you to show your true superiority in terms of faggotry.]]

*'''The Bingo Wheel:''' A troll's ultimate weapon for forge matches. It is acquired in forge by placing 2 trip mine spawns next to each other and set them for immediate respawn. Then you get a partner troll to spin an open box so the open side always faces you. You then proceed to toss [[over 9000]] trip mines into the spinning box. Eventually, the super fortified halo box will start ejecting mines through its edges. Not only does this lag the piss out of even a local forge match, but it overloads the map, causing everything to disappear.

===ODST Weapons===
ODST have to have special stealth weapons due to the fact that they can't run out into battle like a crazy retard absorbing bullets like some sponge and then [[Call of Duty 4|hide behind a wall for five seconds and repeat]].

*'''Silenced SMG:''' Shitty machine gun that shoots quiet bullets. Whoopdee-fucking-doo.
*'''M6S:''' The Halo 2 magnum in the guise of the Halo 1 magnum.

===Cock-venant Weapons and Equipment===
Generally not used because all Covenant weapons suck. You must wonder how a futuristic race cannot even make weapons better than more primative weapons that fire lead.

*'''Plasma Rifle:''' Pretty good in Halo 1. Only good in the other Halo games if used with a combo because they can't kill shit by themselves. Not even zombies.
*'''Plasma Pistol (I'M SAMUS!):''' This weapon is the shittiest [[evar]]. However, it has its upside as you can charge up the blast to knock out all the other players' shields. Yet another good trolling method against MLG if you then pull out your BR and one shot him in the face.

*'''Cock-venant Carbine:''' This weapon is .05 seconds faster than the BR, however no one uses it. Just goes to show you how gay the BR is.
*'''Needler (Noobler):''' This weapon has both homosexuality and down syndrome. It fires pretty [[Faggotry|pink needles]] at the rate of 30 miles per hour. However, don't fuck with someone in Halo 3 if they have this weapon because the needles it fires will make [[you]] explode if they shove enough of them up your ass. Has a range of only 30 feet, any closer or farther away and it's useless. Also if you don't hit them with enough shots to kill them it does absolutely no damage.

*'''Beam Rifle:''' Just as gay as the human sniper except no one uses it.
*'''Fuel Rod Cannon:''' Not used in Matchmaking due to its pwnage.
*'''Energy Sword:''' Preferred weapon for Elites (which is probably why they got pwned in all the wars) and whiny children who can't kill with any other weapon, the energy sword is a camper's delight. Allows you to lunge [[Over 9000]] feet and defy gravity. You can pretend all the other weapons matter, but let's get real; this is the only weapon you'll ever fucking use.

*'''Plasma Grenade:''' [[Cock|Sticky blue balls]] that allow you to kill your enemy with more lulz. Throw them at people and they attach like an angry cat. Ever since Bungie included armor lock in reacharound, sticky grenades have since became completely and utterly useless.
*'''Mauler:''' It's the same as the shotgun except it's allowed in MLG game types. [[Serious Business|Srsly WTF]].
*'''Spiker:''' The worst weapon in Halo 3. Try and kill someone with this and you'll fail miserably.

*'''Brute Shot:''' Pretty good weapon that shoots balls of exploding [[shit]] at your enemies. Don't use it too close to your enemy or else you'll involuntarily become [[an hero|an hero]].

*'''Spike Grenade:''' Same as plasma except they stick to walls and generate more [[Lulz|lulz]].
*'''Gravity Hammer:''' Same as the sword except your enemies fly farther. 
*'''Fire Bomb:''' [[Kill it with Fire|KILL IT WITH FIRE]].
*'''Bubble Shield:''' A giant boob that protects you from everything except other players coming inside the shield to pwn you and enemy vehicles because apparently vehicles and bullets arent made out of the same fucking metal.
*'''Flare:'''"Blinds" your enemies even though you can still see their fucking gamertag above them.
*'''Radar Jammer:''' As if your radar doesn't fail already, this will fuck with your head.
*'''Regenerator:''' Only used to troll people not using 1-hit kill weapons. In other words, useless. Also its for fags and cock lovers that suck to much at the game to stay alive longer than 5 seconds.
*'''Power Drain:''' Used to drain only you and your teams health since you'll most likely fail at throwing it.
*'''Overshield:''' Makes your shields power level [[Over 9000|over 9000]]. Also for cock lovers who can't stay alive. Watch out though, because a [[What|punch to the back will kill you.]]
*'''Active Camo:''' [[Sarcasm|You are completely invisible to all players and it lasts for a long time.]] Active camo is about as useful as a horses cock at a lesbians convention. if you move any faster than your 90 year old whore grandmother, the active camo becomes completely useless. although is it fun for trolling with the sniper rifle lulz.
*'''Sc(arab) Gun''' Some dickweed Covenant soldier decided it would be a good idea to leave an overkill weapon on a building in the enemy planet. If you have absolutely no life, you've probably fired this gun. The only way to obtain it is to [[Fellatio|convince]] a Banshee pilot to let you borrow the damn thing, then fly it through a [[Anus|small tunnel]]. If you're stupid enough, you'll also come across a large soccer ball that does fucking nothing.

===Foreskinner Weapons===
*'''Sentinel beam:''' Piece of shit. No wonder those ancient faggots were killed by a bunch of fucking zombies. It's not included in matchmaking.

===Halo:Reach Weapons===

The new weapons in the game based on observation and interviews.

*'''Grenade Launcher(Poop Pipe):''' [[obvious|Launches grenades]]. Has an alternate fire mode, but you'll never see that used because it can't be spammed.
*'''Concussion Rifle:''' The Brute Shot if it looked like a buttplug and had four extra shots of exploding shit. Annoying and cheap to fight against.
*'''Designated Marksman Rifle:''' Replacement for the Battle Rifle because it sucked too bad in the last two games. The DMR is also a hit scan weapon which should mean it has no bullet travel time, although Bungie somehow found a way to make it worse than the BR. It also fires as slowly as your 80 year old grandpa fucks his 20 year old niece and is really gay just like Bungie.
*'''Combat Knife & Carved Knife:''' Sharp blades of metal that you can use to [[cut]] people...or [[pain|yourself]]. In a nutshell, its fucking awesome.
*'''Needle Rifle:''': If the needler and the carbine got it on, this would be their [[downs syndrome|baby]]. It also takes around 90 shots to kill someone with and if ever in a 1v1 with a DMR cock sucker, you will die.
*'''Plasma Repeater:''' Same as the [[Cock|plasma rifle]] except it fires [[Cum|plasma]] faster than you can throw [[Tits|snowballs]] this time. Its also completely useless in Reacharound and nobody uses it. 
*'''Plasma Launcher:''' The Covenant rocket launcher. It sends [[balls|blue balls]] of rape that chase after you and explode. I've only seen this piece of shit on 1 map and nobody knew where the fuck it was.
*'''Target Locator:''' Point this at some unfortunate [[13 year old boy]] and he will be smitten by God. Or shove it up your ass and feel the vibrations.
*'''Focus Rifle:''' Useful version of the sentinel beam with a scope. Not as "pro" as the sniper rifle. It sucks cock.
*'''Assassination Kills:''' Not exactly a weapon, but just as useless. [[Gears of War|For some reason]], Bungie thinks it's cool to show a five-second clip of you [[rape|stabbing]] an enemy instead of just [[buttsecks|bonking]] the fucker and moving on to the next one. Because reacharound is the biggest flop ever and they needed assassination kills to make the game not suck as hard.

=='''[[Call of duty 4|Perks]]:'''==

*'''Sprinting:''' Not really an armor upgrade. It just gives your character enough brain cells to figure out how to run. While sprinting, you also cannot [[cum|shoot]]
*'''Armor Lock:''' Makes your character useless for 8 seconds. Will deploy an EMP blast, [[lie|but nobody's stupid enough to stand near you]]. Its also abused more than whitney houston and is a major crutch for all the autistic faggots born without thumbs that play this fucking game. Armor lock also single handedly destroyed Reach and thats why nobody plays it anymore.
*'''[[Trolling|Jet Pack]]:''' Allows you be be more of a pussy to your team. Its also good for alerting all your enemies of your presence, thus allowing them to direct all 8 of there cumshots onto your face. Swallowing is optional.
*'''Active Camo:''' Allows you to sneak up and [[Team Fortress 2|sap sentries]] at the expense of your hearing.
*'''[[barrel roll|Evade]]''' Another derp ability for elites. More brain cells are added and you now have the ability to [[lol|roll]]. You can only roll twice though because anymore and your retarded elite's brain might short circuit. 
*'''[[copypasta|Hologram]]:''' It sends a clone of yourself running directly into enemy fire, then it stands still. If it gets shot, it vanishes. [[Retard|Surprising, it works 99% of the time]]
*'''Drop Shield:''' Same thing as the bubble shield, except blue, and it explodes if you punch it.

==Friends and Enemies==

===Friends===
*'''[[Army|Marines]]''' These dumb mother fuckers enjoy long walks on the beach, driving into rocks, driving off cliffs, shooting at rocks and generally shooting at anything besides the enemy. They stroke Master Chief's massive cock any chance they get and even have wet dreams about him. They rely on him to save there asses through out the whole game and have no idea what there doing. There also A bunch of gay sailors and [[You have no friends|your only team mates.]] Don't even try to say the elites were on your side in the 3rd game, we all know you just used them for meat-sheilds and target practice. The marines are competely fucking useless, even on easy. All they do is scream whenever they get shot and run out into fire like [[retards]]. Sometimes they will say something stupid, like "Are you made of Leperchuans? Cuz that was awesome!" Really. That is one of their many awful lines in Halo 2. Oddly enough, only the [[Mexican]] marines say it.

===Enemies===
*'''[[Dinosaurs|Elites]]''' The backbone [[military]] force of the [[Scientology|Covenant]] empire. The manual for each game and the books say that these pricks are smart. '''Bullshit.''' Just like every other person in the game, they will run into enemy fire like they were some [[white]] [[bitch]] trying to catch a stream of [[cum]] being lovingly administered by some random black person. In the second game they got their stupid asses booted out of their [[cult]] when they found out that [[Scientology|the religion that they loved and worshiped was bullshit]]. They came crying to humans to save their sorry asses, and we did, but only because we were getting [[pwned]] too. All you have to do to kill one is grab a plasma pistol and a magnum, shoot the plasma pistol once, and then get a headshot with the magnum.

*'''[[Monkey|Brutes]]''' After the [[dinosaurs]] were removed from office, these [[fat]] fucks came in to replace them. You kill them the exact same way you kill the elites.

*'''[[Midget|Grunts]]''' The dumbest enemy AI I have ever seen in a video game ever. They serve no purpose and are used as meat shields by the Elites and Brutes. Who would have thought that these Wizard of Oz munchkin rejects would actually be the smartest enemies in the whole damn game? However, they are still the most useless enemies in the game. They will do nothing but hide behind random things while they cry and [[shit]] themselves. On the rare occasion that they decide to shoot you, they will miss. Killing a nearby Brute/Elite makes them run away.

*'''[[Furry|Jackal]]''' The greatest [[trolls]] in the game. They will hide behind sheilds and shoot at you, draining your energy sheilds [[at least 100]] times faster than other enemies, while the only thing you can do to beat them is grenade [[spam]]. In other words, they are really fucking easy to kill.

*'''[[Zerg Rush|Drones]]''' These things are hard as hell to kill. They die in one hit, but there are [[over 9000]] of them each time you fight them. They fly around like little pricks and are a [[bitch]] to try and hit.

*'''[[Terrorists|Engineers]]''' If you shoot them they will explode. If you don't, they will leave you alone. Of course, [[you]] being the [[retard]] that you are, will probably shoot them because [[ALL CAPS|THEY ARE SO FUCKING SHINY KILL IT!!!]]

==Master Chief==
The Master Chief, aka ''Master Queef'', ''Captain King'' or ''Master Chef'', is some sort of futuristic cross between [[300|Leonidas]], and [[Mecha-Hitler]], and is a [[fag|pretty cool guy]] because eh kills aleins and doesn't afraid of anything. He's equipped with a half ton full body armor that amplifies strength, has energy shields, and a slot for an AI/USB flash drive, but [[Irony|ironically]] offers zero protection from bullets. Indeed, a [[fellatio|single shot to the head]] will penetrate the futuristic helmet, and will instantly kill him, [[buttsecks|as will a light tap to his back]], but that is ok as he will just respawn in like 5 sec anyway as well as there is a new checkpoint every fucking 5 meters or so. It is also thought that one of his weaknesses may be [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCdtnnwOUA0&feature=dir Head-On.]Master chief also has the ability to [[mexicans|jump higher than most planes can safety fly]], which is even more fucking retarded because of the amount of armor that motherfucker wears.

==Novels==
[[Image:WTF1.png|thumb|left|The idea of what happens at the end of the game series.]]
[[image:GAY.jpg|thumb|right|A [[typical]] Major League Gamer.]]

Not only did this [[retard]]ed game make it on some kind of bestseller list, but a bunch of [[ass]]holes thought it would be funny or something to kill some trees for this Master of [[teh]] [[ghey]]. The [[book]]s include:

===Halo: The Fall of Reach===
A bunch of little whiny [[skript kiddie|six-year olds]] [[fail]] at saving a planet from complete [[pwnage]].

===Halo Graphic Novel===
''Halo'' characters Bungie didn't care enough about to make stories for now have their own book. That's really it. Just a bunch of drawing. Oh, and there's [[porn]] in it. Drawn [[porn]]. Tentacle [[porn]] going into child anus with Master [[faggot|Queef]] watching over them with a huge metallic phallus. Yeah. Go buy it.

===Halo: The Flood===
The game put into a [[book]]. YAWN. Oh, and sometimes the [[faggot]] aliens point of views are shown but nobody cares because they die soon anyway.

===Halo: First [[Strike]]===
Note: This is NOT the first of the series of books, even though it is called the FIRST [[strike]]. Fagtards, you will be confused. The same [[skript kiddie|six-year olds]] blow up a gigantic space station whose [[leet|1337]] [[skill|skillz]] are naught.

===Halo: Contact Harvest===
The following is an actual excerpt from the book, it is not fanfiction:
:''She put her hands on Avery's shoulders and pushed him onto his back. Sitting astride his ankles, Jilan helped him with his pants. Then she crept upward, planted her hands on either side of Avery's head, and began to move.''
:''Avery was instantly entranced by the back-and-forth sway of her bosom. He cupped the weight of her in his hands and knew at once he'd made a tactical error. The heavy roundness of Jilan's skin started an ache that crept up his  legs and settled on the small of his back. All she had to do was squeeze, and a moment later he [[I Came|was spent]].''

===Best Novels===
Unlike Origin Software, Bungie completely denies that they ripped off or were even inspired by Larry Niven's ''Known Space'' novel series. Bungie completely denies that the mind-controlling Flood were inspired by the mind-controlling Puppeteers, '''''OR''''' the religious slavers that fight humanity down to Earth, the Covenant, were inspired by the religious slavers that fight humanity down to Earth, the Kzinti, '''''OR''''' the ancient human ancestors that built the Halos called the Forerunners were inspired by the ancient human ancestors that built the Ringworld called the Pak, '''''OR''''' the ancient weapon worlds used to contain the Flood called the Halos were inspired by the ancient weapon worlds used to contain the Puppeteers called Ringworld.

However, Bungie has admitted that they were inspired by Frank Herbert's ''Dune'', with its spice Melange to describe Master Chief's life-sustaining and mind-altering addiction to [[cocks]].

==Halo:Legends==
[[File:720X405 legends 3.jpg|thumb|right|The image that caused 13-year-old fanboys to shit brix]]
{{Spoiler|FORERUNNERS BALEET EVERYTHING AND AN HERO TO STOP THE FLOOD. THEY THEN REVIVE ALL LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE AND THE FLOOD COMES BACK ONLY TO DIE AGAIN. ALL WOMEN SPARTANS DIE EXCEPT KELLY. ARBITER DIES IN THE SECOND STORY. SGT GHOST DIES IN THE 5TH STORY. FRED AND THE BLACK GUY ALSO DIE IN THE LAST VIDEO}}

Why ruin the gaming world when you can ruin the cinematic one too? That's right, someone though it was a good idea to make halo an anime. The video itself is comprised of peoples sob stories and shows [[sammich|how much women fail in the army and should just stay in the kitchen.]] The only thing good about it is that it FINALLY explains what the [[shit nobody cares about|fuck is happening in the halo story line]]. All the stories are shit. One is based on [[Dragon Ball Z]] and another is [[DeviantArt|horribly filter raped]].

A small shitstorm ensued on Halo forums when a picture of a teddy bear keychain started popping up in relation to one of the collab vids called Homecoming.  This caused all the 13 year olds to collectively shit brix at the thought that maybe their hyper-masculine franchise might have a sensitive side to it. 


==Halo Pros==
MLG or Major League Gaming (also known as chronic [[masterbation|jerking-off]] [[retard|syndrome]]) is a league devised by some [[fag|faggot]] named [[lol wut|Sundance]]. I'm not kidding; his fucking name is Sundance. MLG is full of faggets, queers, 45 year old virgins and pedophiles that love cock. They think there superior to all gamers because they were born with thumbs and use them...quite well I might add. Despite your faggotry and generally over sized ego's there a bunch of swell cock sucking faggots that love enormous amounts of nigger cum all over there faces and eat a lot of cock.

The League is completely devout to developing professional [[basement dwellers]] and pointedly alienating themselves from the [[Woman|opposite sex]]. This "League" is not only afraid of speaking to woman, but also hates any woman that try to get involved in gaming. They make crude gay remarks about how woman belong in the kitchen, but the truth is they'll never get close enough to a woman to have one make them a sandwich. The only woman thats ever made these faggots sandwiches are there mothers.

[[13 year old boys]] usually call themselves [[tourneyfag|MLG pros]] because they spend their time playing custom games with other "MLG pros." None of them go to MLG events because their [[your mom|parents]] don't want to drive them, but the ones that do go lose in the first round and get [[butthurt]]. Then they return to their respective [[internets]] forums and [[cry|bawwwwww]] about how unfair it was. They also watch videos of all there favorite MLG pro's and ask them what there in-game sensitivity level is. They still suck there mothers tits and eat a lot of cock.

MLG recently had a show on the USA network which showed the ''Halo 2'' segment of the pro circuit. It was super lame and [[Noone|no one]] really liked it. Except when [[Walshy]] started crying because his [[gay|great]] team didn't win. This created a few lulz to many people who love seeing [[unrealistic expectations|other peoples' retarded hopes and dreams]] not come true. Walshy is a faggot pussy that wouldn't last 5 seconds outside of his mothers basement and loves black cum.

This is, of course, a [[moot]] point, because anyone who devotes his life to being a pro at a videogame is a [[fucktard]] and has no real ambitions in life.

<video type="youtube" id="KWF1ue0XLPI" width="540" height="406" desc="The 4 year old has since changed his Gamertag a few times to avoid harassment by pedophiles." frame="true" position="center"/>

Shows how the real pros of ''Halo'' talk to the noobs. Note how the 4 year old is actually winning the argument and completely owning the 13 year-old kid. Both are fucking idiots though and deserve to be raped by michael jackson.

<video type="youtube" id="Y2VekrXIPtA" width="540" height="406" desc="Notice how everything this kid says sounds oddly familiar." frame="true"
position="center"/>

This also shows how [[retard|uber leet gamers]] talk to noobs.

==Flood detected==
Another vile spawn of the Halo series is The Flood. they are [[lie|NOT ZOMBIES AT ALL]], but are little spider things that [[rape|burrow through your skin]] and take you over turning you into a [[Rosie O'Donnell|hideous monster]]. After [[pwnt|PWNING]] the ancient faggots who lived [[over 9000]] years ago, the faggots fired [[cock|weapons of mass destruction]], pwning [[and nothing of value was lost|all life in the galaxy]]. Yet somehow they came back and proceeded to pwn humans and teh covernant once again. Again the only way to kill the flood was to completely [[pwnt|pwn]] every living thing in the galaxy. This is apparently the only way to get rid of the flood although the Master Chief seems to do a pretty good job of it.

[[Tl;dr|Long story short]], the Flood were better when they were called the [[Star Trek|Borg]].

==Fanboys==
[[File:Halo 3 condoms.jpg|thumb|right|Official Halo product.]]

Despite its lack of [[Sonic the Hedgehog|Italian plumbers]] and [[Mario|blue hedgehogs]], Halo may be the most fanboyed game of all time.

{{morphquote|halofanboys||font-weight: bold;|
wow, i think these people cant handle th fact that they suck at Halo.

http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Halo

http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Halo

Not only that, i cant find ONE single article about them liking a game.
Anyway, those pages alone have turned me off these websites.|Igloobanana, ''[http://lounge.moviecodec.com/games/butthurt-anyone-84014/]''
|Wait wait wait

You go to a website which is meant to make fun of everything, and you complain about them making fun of things?

Derp.

Also, Halo sucks.|Haylias, ''responding to previous''
|the website IS made to make fun, yes, [[lie|but that doesn’t mean you gotta make fun of the people who play it]]. Hell, they insulted Sgt. Johnson. [[not gay|You just don’t do that. ever.]]

[[bawww|and is it the fact that IT sucks, or do you simply suck at it? Or is it that you do not like FPs games at all? what reason do you have?]]|Igloobanana, ''to previous''

|I've beaten Halo: Combat Evolved on every level. The cool thing is the ending when you beat it on Legendary Mode. I would tell you what happens in the legendary ending but I don't what to spoil it for you. It's worth seeing though. I don't know why, but I think the last level (The Maw) is the EASIEST level to beat on Legendary. I mean, once you get a shotgun and Rocket Launcher, or at least when [[usi|''I'']]get a shotgun and a Rocket Launcher. If anybody needs help, you could always ask me!|Mike, ''[http://www.trap17.com/index.php/Halo-Game_t5478.html]''}}
