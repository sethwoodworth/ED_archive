The LiveJournal Circle Jerk

'''The LiveJournal [[Circle jerk|Circle Jerk]]''' is an [[elitist]] group of inept [[troll]]s who go about [[LiveJournal]], [[Fellatio|fellating]] one another's egos at every turn.

==The Circle Jerk's membership==
The Circle Jerk consists of every [[user]] on LiveJournal, past and present, except for [[User:Daniels_penis|daniels_penis]] and his [[friends list]], and [[Drama Queen Kim]]. It was first outed by [[User:Daniels_penis|daniels_penis]] on {{lj|iwrotetherules}}'s [[LiveJournal]].

Many of its members don't even associate with each other openly at all, instead communicating in secret using Morse Code and carrier pigeons. This gives the outward impression that nothing untoward is actually going on, so much so that many of those associated with the Circle Jerk have no idea they are actually members.

The [[conspiracy]] is far-reaching, and even includes [[LJ Abuse]], who zealously suspend the accounts of any user who poses a threat to the clique or its members.

The group is led by [[User:Gerbilsage|Gerbilsage]] (sometimes under the guise of his [[obvious]] [[sock puppet]], [[Brainlesswonder]]).
