Hallcats Squadron
'''The Hallcats Squadron''' is a group of [[13 year old boys]] and [[16 year old girls]] on the site [http://acecombatskies.com Acecombatskies.com]. They seem to think that they are [[1337]] because they have over 70 members, more than most (or all) squadrons. They have their own [[news]], and a reporter who [[fucktarded|can't spell]].

[[Image:HC-new.png|thumb|Their new logo.]]

They claim to be the true mercenary force when in reality, they don't have any real weaponry or planes. All they actually have is [http://www.acecombat.jp Ace Combat] [[Role-playing|roleplaying]]. But they actually get paid with services such as [[Fellatio|blowjobs]], [[furry]] [[pr0n]], and [[Goatse]]. Sometimes, they get shitty [[Photomanip|graphics]] that took [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|over 9000]] hours in [[The GIMP]]. GIMP is their ''FAVORITE'' program, since all of them (except for one, who uses Fireworks) make their BEST signatures with it.
Their sigs:
*Are the ''BEST'' ever. Seriously.
*Take [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|over 9000]] hours in [[MS Paint|Paint]]
*Are many in number, AND in fail.
[[Image:646px-Howdoiantialias.png|thumb|The question which is asked the most.]][[Image:Harp seal dead.jpg|thumb|The proper way to club a Hallcat.]]

They don't seem to know that there is something called [[Adobe® Photoshop®]]. 

===Their Leader===
Zadkiel, their over-dramatic leader always takes the squadron seriously. When one poor girl left his squadron, he got all [[butthurt]] and posted the following:

[[Shit nobody cares about|"well it is insulting to me. I wont take 100% of the responsibility for the HC's recent expansion. A lot of it has to do with the other members spreading the word to people who havent joined or a looking for a squad to join. To say the HC is lying is a lie.

Saying we're too strict? [color=red]*CENSORED*[/color]? We're the MOST laid back here on ACS. We're only really enforcing the rule because we need to. The mods are having to crackdown on the excess of spam. Who's the first person they go to to get this remedied? Me. I cant just sit and do nothing, all that they say is legit.

Saying the HC is dying and is strict is personally insulting to me. I do all I can to get this squad active and to keep it laid back. I cant count the amount of times I've been PMed by a mod about an HCer. I defend the HCer and tell the mod to hold off until I can get in contact with the member and talk it out. If you're looking for an even more laid back squad than this you wont find it.

I'm shoving a 5 word post min down your throat? IT'S THE RULES FOR PETE SAKES!!!! How can I just sit back and let people make one word posts and such when the mods can easily come in and shut any topic that gets out of control down?

I just find your comments insulting and rude to be frank about it. Its baseless accusations like these that make me regret taking the CO position. Why should I lead when I get ungrateful comments from members leaving?"]]

And that same girl didn't really care, so he posted:

[[Emo|"But to say the HC is dying? That we're strict? Those are offensive to me. I didnt create the HC, but I feel I have played a large part in it being what it is today. Making comments like that about the HC is like making a demeaning comment about me and my efforts, do you understand?"]]

Yes, we do understand that the HC is [[serious business]].

==How the Hallcats were created==
[[Image:Hallcatsposter.png|thumb|How it all began.]]
It all began one day when [http://forums.acecombatskies.com/index.php?showuser=386 MAV Wolf] did a very [[Shitty|awesome]] squadron poster in the [[Photoshop]]. He seemed to have  misspelled "Hellcat" as "Hallcat", and when a young girl discovered this mistake, she spread it around in an attempt to cause some lulz and butthurt, like the [[cunt]] she is. It almost worked, and since she had plans of great evil, she saved the poster. Such events called for a new group of people... The Hall Monitors.  They brutally and eagerly club these [[Retard|rabid]] [[Furry|felines]] until death. Sometimes, when the cat still survives, they may run it over.
===12 AGNRY Hallcats===
One hallcat attempted to write something, a [[shitty]] novel called "12 Angry Hellcats". There were MANY grammar mistakes, MANY obvious mispellings, and MUCH fail. IT WAS A VERY SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT WRITING. The kid who wrote this, [http://forums.acecombatskies.com/index.php?showuser=2454 Thanalyst], thought it was a great piece, and that everybody would love it, but no. It failed. 
[[Image:Cystsbutthurtbegan.PNG|thumb|Raped, owned, and buried.]]

And so the [[butthurt]] began. The 12 angry hallcats began to go RAWWRGHH!!1 GRRR!!!1, since they couldn't do much about it. 
But one of them decided to stop growling and roaring, and to actually speak english.

[[Burger the Angry Cat|"FU HARD IN THE ASS ZAKU. It would take you a couple of days to make a fanfic. This took 3 hours.
You are a piece of **** commander.. I bet there is a better person in the FA who is much better than you.

As you can tell i hated your comment. and I was bored out of my mind and created a fanfic. You dont have any intentions to create a fanfic do you?

uh! Dumass!

Marco -- Polo.. Marco -- FUCK YOU"]]

FU? What's "FU"?

RAAWWWRRGGGHHH!!!1
These guys are also TOTAL badasses. 
<div style="color: black; background-color: white; width: 575px; border: thin black solid; padding: .5em;">

:ZADKIEL: So that's when we move to attempted pub descruction. The IEDs brought back to the lab were from a terrorist unit in the outskirts of Moscow, 24 hours ago, the terrorist unit was effectively assasinated by Government assasins.
:BEAR: In soviet russia, assasin kill you
:UNSTUNG: That was bland
:BEAR: So is your mom"


</div>

Terrorist units? Are these the people that caused [[WTC]]??? It seems the Hallcats are indeed responsible for [[WTC]], not the [[Jews]], or the government, like some [http://forums.acecombatskies.com/index.php?showuser=130 faggot] keeps on saying. 
After a mod ended all the RAAWWWRRGGGHHH!!!1ing and all the GRRR!!!1ing, one brave man by the name of Zaku decided to challenge the literary master. The challenge was accepted, and we all waited to see who would win. We knew who would win, anyways. But, the [[Anal]] Lyst analyzed the situation he was in, and saw that he would lose, so he quit, saying that he was too busy [[IRL]].
[[Image:12angryhallcats.png|thumb|What they REALLY said about it all.]] 

[[Anal]] Lyst was still [[butthurt]], since he got a new nickname (Cyst) and mostly everyone made fun of him and his [[shitty]] novel. Remenber, if you club 1 hallcat, 12 ANGRY ones will go on you.

==Hallcatism==
An occult group, Hallcatism was created by a guy called Darren the Ender, on August something, 2007. He was pissed at his life, also at Zadkiel's inactivity, his [[shitty]] ideas for an already shitty group of roleplayers, and him not wanting to do much. But what will a group led by [[13 year old boys]], led by a bitchy 17 year old do to a 21 year old man who has something called work IRL, that's always [[butthurt]] and [[emo]]??? Overthrow him of course! While the Hallcatists do their [[serious business]], this article will gain moar.
Get off the PSP, Ender. You're just jealous that you don't have "power". Or that Zadkiel has a gf and that you don't. Anyways, if you say yes to any of these, you're one of them:
*You have [[over 9000]] cats and no dog.
*You hate [[Photoshop]], and LOVE [[The GIMP]] like some 43 year old man from Maryland.
*You make [http://hosting.conduit.com/Messages/?ct=CT804945&msg_box_id=xml1618676984&msg_id=283189&tm=128309333020000000&q=Treaty+of+St.+Ark+Signed+by+BAF%2c+Crusaders%2c+and+RAD fictional treaties].
*You call any normal cat a Hallcat, but you don't club it. 
*You wont give you cat to science so two people can see if it can blow up!
If you do any of these, you are indeed a [[faggot]] and MUST be castrated, since [[Raptor Jesus]] says so. 
Hallcatism is worse than Satanism, and when the pastor asks you to spread your cheeks in order to receive the holy big wood, DO IT, for it shall protect you from the Hallcat AIDS.

'''Lol wut?'''
<div style="color: black; background-color: white; width: 575px; border: thin black solid; padding: .5em;">
Bleh,
You have been suspended untill I say otherwise. You have not been suspended because of violation of forum rules, but because you are an annoying pain in Ender's ass. Ender will admit that he is corrupt, and that he is enjoying doing this. He also encourages you to call him "buthurt", "emo", and "bitchy", along with other names, because it will only increase his laughter. 
Running to Zaku or another ACS mod to get Ender suspended would also only increase his laughter, but put a smile on his face. If you wish to continue your friendship with certain HellCats, be my guest. He also leaves you with a little piece of advice.

Your in high school now, grow up.
Thanks, have a nice day

Oh and dont piss them off when playing ace combat, they WILL kick you and try to ban you from XBL , HALLCATS RULE!!!!111111
