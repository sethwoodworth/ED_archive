Sega Game Gear

The Sega Game Gear was a semi-portable [[gaming]] device released in [[At least 100 years ago|1991]], even though it would have been obsolete two years earlier when compared to the [[Nintendo]] [[Gameboy|Game Boy]] (which was the same [[shit]], only [[Nintendo]]-branded and with a smaller [[puke]]-black person, totally invisible screen). Fortunately, it did not generate the same amount of success as the Game Boy to say the least. Game Gear slightly edged out [[castration]] in a poll of enjoyability, making it not as bad as [[Virtual Boy]].

==Fanboys Unite!!!!1!1==
The Game Gear started life as a weapon Sega [[fanboy]]s used to hunt other [[fanboys]]. Word soon spread that this device which weighed [[at least 100]] pounds could play games. Fanboys rejoiced and proclaimed they were the best. The Game Gear had a back light that could light up the screen, allegedly making it easier to play in sunlight - an ironic concept as most children playing computer consoles from 1990 onwards had no idea what sunlight was. The settings were extremely bleached out colors, blinding white, 99% black person, and off. It also used 72 AA-Batteries which had a life span of 7 minutes. This gave it a power reactor that rivaled nuclear power. [[Fanboys]] quickly proclaimed "[[Nine_thousand|ITS OVER NINE THOUSAND]]" volts.

However, it didn't sell for four reasons.  
*1. [[16 year old girl]] demography didn't support it.
*2. Sega is the company sponsored by [[Ann Coulter]].
*3. [[/b/]] didn't exist at the time
*4. LOL, Sega


==Games Available for the Game Gear==
The only game ever created for the Game Gear was ''Columns'', a ''Tetris'' clone that had all of the frustration and none of the fun or playability. It is [[lie|rumored]] that, unlike ''Tetris'', it was possible to actually beat ''Columns'' if a high enough score was attained. Unfortunately this was never proven, as the Game Gear's batteries would be drained long before such a score could even be approached. Nobody ever dared to plug the device into mains electricity as scientists had already proven that doing so would effectively switch off the sun for a period of at least 7 minutes.

==Sega Bites The Curb==
The Game Gear shared the same processor as the Master System, a [[Fail|failed]] system. This was arguably the best idea in history, rivaling only New Coke. Game Gear was essentially a portable failed system that set the pace for a horrible, horrible series of failures (Sega Mega CD, Sega 32X, Sega Saturn, Sega Mega PC etc.).


==Teh End==
The Game Gear was mercifully ended by Sega before Game Boy Color even came out, which would have only made the [[lulz]] more plentiful. Currently, you can find a used Game Gear for about $5 at a garage sale. Discovery Channel says if you put more than 10 Game Gear systems in the same room, [[Satan]] will appear. This is not confirmed, and since [[noone]] has seen a Game Gear in [[at least 100]] years, it never will be.

The most significant media mention of the Game Gear since 2002 was in the magazine ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''. Half way through a review the word Game Gear was mentioned. This launched garage sale prices from $4.25 to $4.75, surpassing the [[Pedobear|Tickle Me Elmo]], [[gay|He-Man]] action figures, and that stroller I bought in 1982 but only used a few times since my wife divorced me because of her newly found [[Feminism]], and she got custody. At least I got my [[penis|boat]] though.
