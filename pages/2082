David After Dentist
[[Image:David-after-dentist and dad.jpg|thumb|right|'''DRUGGED KID = $$$$''']]
'''David After Dentist''' is a shitty video displaying some fat nerd drugging his son, grabbing a camera and cashing in on the results. It, unsurprisingly, took off like wildfire on the [[YouTube|PooTube]] and every faggot with [[lonely|no friends]] wanted in on the action. The popularity of the video has resulted in [[profit]]s being made by the dipshits at [[knowyourmeme]].com and the father involved in the drugging of the child. Oh, did we mention the bumper-stickers?

Admittedly, watching a drugged kid talk rabid trash is a pretty interesting concept. Unfortunately, a plague of unfunny jumped onto this humorous video before it even had a chance to ascend the ranks of [[meme|"hey did you see that thing on the internet..."]]

Within days, variation videos were posted all over YouTube, starring anything and anyone ranging from hot chicks, bored [[college]] [[nerd]]s and [[Star Wars|Darth Vader]] -- or was that Chad Vader?

==Charlie Bit My Finger... WTF??==
Now the [[Joseph Fritzl|prick father]] is trying to turn the incident with his drugged out kid into another moronic "Charlie Bit My Finger" craze in order to get his own 5 minutes of fame. However, what Charlie didn't know is that he now has [[aids]] and will die. [[death|Problem solved.]]
