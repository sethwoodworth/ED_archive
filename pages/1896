A '''cultural cringe''' is somebody that [[Why_do_you_hate_America%3F|hates America]] (or whatever country they come from) and won't shut up about how much better it is somewhere else. Naturally, the Internet is brimming with these types. Some varieties include:

* [[Wapanese]] - Hates their country, wishes they were Japanese.
* [[Koreaboo]] - Hates their country, wishes they were Korean.
* [[Wigger]] - Hates being [[white people|white]], wishes they were [[black]].
* [[Furry]] - Hates being human, wishes they were some freakish half-animal hybrid.
* [[Otherkin]] - Hates being human, wishes they were [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|a dragon]].
* [[Otakukin]] - Hates reality, wishes their favorite [[anime]] was real.

[[Ironically]] the majority of cultural cringrs are [[white people]] who feel guilty about once having ruled most of world and desperately try to apologise by bastardizing other cultures. Non-white people who hate their own countries and want to get into America are known as '''immigrants'''.
