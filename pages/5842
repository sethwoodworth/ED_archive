Not gay

Similar to [[not racist]] and the predecessor of [[no homo]], '''not gay''' is inserted into a sentence that might otherwise reveal the homosexuality of the speaker. "Not gay" is the OL predecessor of the IRL terms "bromance" and "mancrush", proving once again that the internet makes you gay.

Popularized by a post to the defunct allaboutsex.com, where a user posted this message:

{{squote|My [[Micropenis|penis is very small]] and smells of prawns, my friend who I experiment with (NOT GAY!) says it makes him feel sick to [[Blowjob|suck it]], but his penis is nice, I like to suck that. I know I can't [[Advertising|make my penis bigger]], but I want it to stop smelling of prawns, I shower [[lol|every other day]] and spend 5minutes with a sponge doing vigorous rubbing untill my end is sore, but no it still smells. help?}}

In the event that you ever open your mouth to say something that you feel '''needs''' to have "not gay" added somewhere to the end of the sentence, you're probably a [[faggot]]. For example: ''[[you|I]] [[jizz|get excited]] every time there's a standup routine by [[Dane Cook]]! I love him in a totally '''not gay''' way.''

[[some argue|Most people]] [[common knowledge|believe]] that the difference between gay and not gay is that even [[fisting|the most debauched sex act]] is not gay if the participants don't touch [[balls]]. Arguing for, or against it is entirely [[fail|pointless]] because it is so well-established. I mean, think about it. An [[asshole]] is an asshole, just like a mouth is a mouth. A [[vagina|woman's]] anus isn't a velvet carpeted runway either, so how's it so different from diving into a man?  (Um, less hair?  [[Hurr]], virgin.) This is all, of course, presuming you two [[fags]] aren't rubbing nuts.

However, many [[Jorge Serrano|closet fags]] also believe that even the most violently homosexual act is not gay unless you're gay. [[facepalm|Meaning if you gay buttfuck, and neither of you are gay, then it's not really gay, even if your balls ''do'' touch.]]

Image:Go cougars.jpg|"My dick is above-average in size (many girls can back me up on that one), and my dick is actually just long enough for me to get my tongue on it without too much effort-- and to actually suck the end of it with great effort. And for those of you that claim that's gay, then you are by logical extension calling all guys who have masturbated with their hand gay too-- just because they gave themselves a handjob doesn't mean they want to do that to other guys, and it's the same for self-blowjobs." [[Goronchev|''Goronchev'']],on how sucking your own dick is not gay.
