Stalking Cat
[[Image:Stalking Cat face.jpg|thumb|Yes, this is his face]]
'''Dennis Avner''' was your run of the mill [[furfag]] working as a sonar technician in the [[Navy]], but thanks to his [[Native American]] heritage, he was advised by a Chief to "follow the ways of the tiger". Dennis [[stupid|took this literally]] and spent bazillions of dollars to turn himself into a giant fucking cat and gave up his "slave name" to go by his [[WOW]] name of '''Stalking Cat'''. '''Cat Man''' as he is known by the media, spent all his life's earnings on irreversible plastic surgery, tattooing, and other forms of mutilation such as whisker implants and a [[lol wut|bionic tail]], and will not stop [[unrealistic expectations|until he is 100% feline]], [[what|which includes grafting fur onto his body and being modified to walk on all fours]]. His [[lol|lulzy]] dreams have landed him regular spots on many TV <strike>freak</strike> talk shows and TV specials (such as ''[[Larry King]] Live'', ''Ripley's Believe It or Not'' and VH1's ''Totally Obsessed'') making him the most <strike>famous</strike> notorious and <strike>prolific</strike> retarded furry in the world. Though he claims he is "not a furry" and that this is only a part of his cultural heritage, he regularly appears at [[furry|furcon]]s and is known to be extremely rude to con staffs, volunteers, and artists because he thinks he is [[teh]] [[shit]]z. He is hailed by furfags everywhere as a <strike>legend</strike> [[fuck|fucking]] [[faggot]].
