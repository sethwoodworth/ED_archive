Comic Genesis
{{pixplz}}

'''Comic Genesis''' (formerly Keenspace) is site for scarily-obsessive [[anime]] fanatics, but primarily functions as a [[gay]] male dating site. A large majority of users are obsessed with [[homoerotic]] [[furry]] [[porn]] (in fact, one of their administrators authors a comic about a [http://www.stalag99.net/ hermaphrodite wolf-skunk hybrid], if this website wasn't bad enough to begin with). Comic Genesis also dabbles in the world of [[webcomics]], the lowest form of art in the universe, and some of the worst webcomics ever produced are hosted by this server..

== Services ==

In exchange for the placement of advertisements, Comic Genesis provides automatic updating tools that frequently don't work, a free <tt>.Comic Genesis.com</tt> domain that makes it impossible to bring traffic to any comic website because of the long length of the domain name, a free message board for hosted comics that will likely never be used by anyone, and community/support in the form of an active forum constantly brimming with fresh [[trolls]].

As there is no requirement to join other than having a [[comic]] to put up, a great deal of the comics hosted on this server range from [http://kitnkayboodle.comicgenesis.com/ horrible] to [http://www.stalag99.net/ horrendous].

== History ==

Keenspace was created in July [[2000]] as a free webhosting service for comics. Since its founding, it has undergone many technological and design upgrades, which have done nothing to increase either the quality or reliability of the site. It primarily hosts poorly drawn [[hentai]], shitty video-game sprites, and angsty comics by [[emo]]-wannabes.

In March [[2005]], Keenspace announced a name change to Toonspace, because Keenspot bigwig Chris Crosby didn't think the original name was godawful enough. They finally settled on a new name, "Comic Genesis" in an attempt to leech off of the non-existent popularity of the [[Sega Genesis]].

Since the site crashes so frequently and the administrators like to edit the posts of the only comics creators that bring traffic to the site to the liking of their furfag administrator, a lot of people have left the site. Traffic has significantly gone down since the only successful comics creators who've ever been a part of this site have left because of already-established issues and creative control drama.

Members of Comic Genesis claim that the server is a breeding ground for next generation Keenspot comics, because they think it makes them feel special. If you've seen some of the crap posted on this site, you can tell that hardly anyone on this site will ''ever'' achieve any level of success. Many people on here try to convince themselves that they will, but at this point, it's just sad and pathetic in its level of bullshit.
