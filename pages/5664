Navid
{{Forced Meme}}

'''Navid''', otherwise known as '''Arab Boy''' is a [[unfunny|hilarious]] [[forced_meme|forced meme]] originating on [[B|/b/]] in early 2008.  It all started with a harmless post of an [[terrorist|Arab]] teenager with the equally-[[unfunny|hilarious]] caption [[pretty cool guy|"BLOWS YOU UP AND DOESN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING"]]. Things got out of control afterwards with [[newfag|newfags]] creating entirely too many image macros of this kid, a sample of which can be found below.
