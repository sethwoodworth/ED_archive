{{quote|He's as queer as blazes!|Ron Paul on the [[Sacha_Baron_Cohen/Other_Characters|American people]]}}

'''L. Ron Paul''' is a 75-year-old [[Scientologist|gynecologist]] who doesn't believe in [[evolution]] and is a Texas congressman with [[drugs|delusions of grandeur]] who thought he was going to be the the next president of the United States. He was the only [[White Nationalism|true conservative]] in the 2008 presidential race, and he [[batshit insane|defends our constitution vigorously]]. He did not win Super Tuesday, and had no chance of winning; this is mainly attributed to the fact that he believes all [[Rape|crimes]] should be punishable by [[death]], especially [[gay|homosexuality]], [[abortion]], and [[suicide]]. He'll win in [[2012]].  Did we mention that his supporters are batshit crazy?


Paul's hatred of the Constitution runs long and deep. This is because he is upset that they counted black person as 3/5's of a person. He actually wanted them to be less than that, maybe 1/5 or 1/10. 

Paul is an internet [[cult]] leader worshiped among [[Alex Jones]], [[Hal Turner]], [[meth|Douglass Bickford]] and The Hickory Mastacasta fanbois. Ron has already been elected as President of the Internets, where he has a [[fat|huge]] fanbase. He's either a batshit fundie and major [[redneck]] or engaged in a historically [[epic]] trolling of a major political party. Either way, his [[basement-dweller|supporters]] are definitely batshit insane. For example:

{{quote|His platform is to abolish the Federal Reserve and the IRS, bring the troops home, throw out the shitty patriot and homeland security acts, minimize government involvement in our private lives and end the fucked-up war on drugs. Yeah, what the hell is he thinking? The private owners of the Federal Reserve do not want it abolished. Kennedy tried - pwned. Youtube: Rockefeller is scared of Ron Paul and Censorship of Ron Paul.  As far as the CO$ endorsing Ron Paul, fuck the CO$. Love WBM & kitties and Magoo. By all means, read on, but do some further research. Write in Ron Paul for President 2008. The constitution was designed to protect us from all the shit that's coming down-no other candidates talk about honoring it. With all that Ron Paul stands for, I am at a loss with this page.|Ron Paul supporter, being tl;dr as usual}}

{{quote|Now, a lot of you are probably wondering... why Jerry isn't with us tonight. Well, I'll tell you. The fact is he's tied up. I'm the one who tied him. Well, I know you think I'm joking... but, believe me, that's the only way... I could break into show business... by hijacking Jerry Langford. Right now, Jerry is strapped to a chair... somewhere in the middle of the city. Go ahead, laugh. Thank you. I appreciate it. But the fact is, I'm here. Now, tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding... and you'll think I was crazy. But, look, I figure it this way. Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime. Thank you.

Jews who otherwise despise Ron Paul and hate everything he stands for still vote for him [[Lie|<s>and donate money to his campaign</s>]](Jews don't give money to anyone). [http://fundrace.huffingtonpost.com/neighbors.php?type=name&lname=Degrippo&fname=sherrod&search=Search We did it for the lulz.]

Some individuals supported Ron Paul under the mistaken belief that the fact he spoke out against the Jew-controlled Federal Reserve meant that he was [[win|an enemy of the Jews]]. In reality, Ron Paul wants the U.S. dollar to be backed by [[Jew gold]] and follows the economic philosophy of the [[Nazi|Austrian fascist]] Jew [[shit nobody cares about|Ludwig von Mises]]. 


==Ron Paul's Internet Gestapo==
[[Image:Ron_paul_trolls.jpg|thumb|right|Online trolls love Ron Paul]]
[[fag|Ron Paul's supporters]], known as "'''Ronpauloompas'''", "'''Paulestinians'''", "'''Paulsies'''", "'''Paultards'''" or "'''RonBots'''", happen to be some of the most rabid of all of the internets, even surpassing [[Anonymous]] in terms of terroristic capability. In an attempt to please the [[lulz]] Gods, and piss off all the talking heads on [[Television|teevee]], a particularly cunning terrorist-[[hacker]] sect of Paultards have set out spamming the internets with Ron Paul propaganda, and filling Paul's coffers with stolen money.

His fanbois, The Ronulans, are probably some of the most easily trolled on the entire internet. Just say you're [[Jewish]] or [[Black]], claim allegiance to the [[Illuminati]], Freemasons, North American Union, or ZOG entity, or mention that Ron Paul has publicly denied that [[Jews did WTC]], thus alienating his base.  [[Last Thursday]], after his wiki was redecorated with [[Goatse]] by [[anonymous]], his supporters proved how truly libertarian they are by making everyone submit a scan of their photo ID and other personal information in order to have edit privileges. LULZ IRONY.

To see the Ron Paul Gestapo in action, write something a little critical of Ron Paul and post it on whichever internets you please.  Within one hour, no matter where you posted it, your message will have been swarmed by angry Ron Paul fanbois eager to curbstomp anyone who gets in the way of the Ron Paul R3VO_|ution.  Scientists have attempted to harness this instinctive reaction by posting mean things about Ron Paul over tar pits, sinkholes and wheat threshers.

Ron Paul is all things to all people, a veritable Leatherman tool that comes with a mobile home and a kitchen sink as well. Each of [[retard|Ron Paul's supporters]] believes in a different single issue, and all of them think that their issue is his [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|primary issue]]. Thus on stormfront.org, Ron Paul is a [[Kramer|white supremacist]]; to [[Christians]], Ron Paul is against [[gay]] marriage and abortion; on [[digg]], Ron Paul supports ending the drug war; on [[Facebook]], Ron Paul is a [[Libertarian]]; on [[Daily_Kos|dailykos]], Ron Paul is a progressive aggressive. Similar to passive aggressive, but involves a lot more [[shotacon]]!1!!12! In being in such a mind set, Ron Paul expresses his best known views on the war.

{{quote|On day of my election, I will pull all American troops out of the war. From there, I'll order bombs to be strapped to all the blacks of America where they'll be sent back over to Middle East to finish the job.|Ron Paul on solving all of America's problems}} 

To millions of Burmese [[hurricane|cyclone]] victims, he is also a heartless bastard. Last Thursday, when a congressional resolution merely offering "condolences and sympathy" to the victims came up for a vote, Ronny was the only member of the entire US Congress to vote "[[NO U]]!"

Despite his large following on teh intarwebs, there are a few Ron Paul Truthers who expose Ron Paul and his supporters for what they really are -- Nazi-Terrorist-Conspiratard Spambots . However, they are often attacked by the Ron Paul Gestapo and angry mobs of internet [[Loser|supporters]]. However, the attacks are often not taken [[srsly]] and are good for a few lulz.

== President of the Internets ==
[[Image:Ronpaulsinauguration.JPG|thumb|300px|Ron Paul is sworn in as President of the Internets]]
[[Image:revolootion.png|thumb|right|Ron Paul Internet campaign logo]]

By next Tuesday, despite having only 8% of the vote, [[IRL]], Ron's overwhelming internet following got him declared President of the Internets defeating [[Howard Dean]], the 2004 internet choice.  Ron Paul had to cotton swab his throat before bowing down before [[Al Gore]], who has been Emperor of the Internet since he created it. Analysts expect his [[IRL]] support could climb has high as 8.1% if his [[Computer Science]] major undergrad base figures out how to send in absentee ballots, since they don't have cars to drive in to vote and [[your mom|mom]] said she'd only drive them back and forth that day if they would vote for <s>[[Rudy Giuliani|Rudy]]</s> [[McCain]].

Ron Paul has also secured twice as many subscribers on YouTube as the black person, [[Obama|Obama bin Laden]], in half the time spent on the dot coms.

ATTN: All tinfoil-hat-wearing Paulites!!! The [[FBI|government]] wants to tax you for going on to the internets and using [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|this site]]. [[Ron Paul]] wants to save [[Al Gore|Al Gore's]] invention from taxation. Everyone knows this is a [[Jewish]] plot. Oh yeah and he doesn't believe in [[evolution]].

Paul placed FIRST (37%) in the [[MySpace]] primary, ahead of Huckabee (18%) and Giuliani (16%), ensuring that he will receive the coveted [[13-year-old boy]] and [[16-year-old girl]] vote.[http://www.adweek.com/aw/iq_interactive/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003691224] 

This is (of course) irrelevant, as you have to be '''at least 18''' to vote in the United States, and the grannies running the polling booths know how to spot fake IDs.

== Ron Paul's blimp ==
Like all sellouts, you can't be successful without advertisement. Ron Paul was already famous on the [[internet]]s and needed a way to spread his batshit insane ideals to the general public of [[IRL]] people, SO HE GOT A FUCKING BLIMP!!!1! Quite Contrary to the impact that was intended, it left many people wondering "Who the fuck is Ron Paul...?". Perhaps his supporters decided a zeppelin was more effective at getting the message across rather than the conventional means of [[Fox News|media]]. Perhaps they were imagining that the average American would look up during his or her favorite sporting event to notice the blimp, stop watching the game, Google "Ron Paul" and become True Believers. [[PROFIT|PROFIT!!!!]] What they [[fail|failed]] to take into account is the fact is that [[football|people don't give a fuck]].  GO BEARS!
[[Image:Epic Fail Candidate is here.jpg|thumb|right|Oh there is a television. Ai am on it. Ai has a blimp. Pay no attention to the tail, that is just totem signs of good luck. Vote for Ru Paul on November 11th.]]

==Ron Paul 'Whoregate' scandal==
[[Image:Ronswhore.jpg|thumb|left|Fox News "coverage" of the scandal.]]
[[Image:Pimpingforpaul.jpg|thumb|right|Ron Paul gazing lustfully at his entire Nevada constituency.]]
It recently came to the attention of the media at large that Ron Paul is accepting money from the Moonlite BunnyRanch, a Carson City cum bucket owned by Dennis Hof. Paul used this revelation to espouse his views on individual liberties, saying he 'doesn't screen incoming donations'. Paul supporters were worried, however, that this may doom the campaign to an unending scandal made of [[AIDS]], and presumably massive [[fail]].

Worry soon subsided as most of the mainstream media became more and more disinterested. Evidence shows that this happened entirely in response to several media correspondents taking the Bunny Ranch up on their 2-for-the-price-of-1 'Pimpin for Paul' special. MSNBC's premier journalist, Tucker Carlson, even went as far as to pledge his support for Ron Paul on Live television; citing a recent off-screen rendezvous with several Bunny Ranch prostitutes (which ended in the untimely death of Snuggles the [[autistic]] hamster) as the cause.

It should come as no surprise that Paul gained the endorsement of a Nevada brothel owner, however. As a practicing OB/GYN, it could be said that Paul does indeed "like teh [[Cunt|pussy]]". In fact, he likes the pussy so much that he's willing to deal with any [[Hillary Clinton|mangled piece of sour smelling roast beef]] that slogs into his office. Anthropologists believe that this endorsement is simply pussy's way of returning the favor.

Despite being the only candidate to bother running TV ads in [[Nevada]], Ron Paul only placed a distant second, with Mitt Romney voters outnumbering him four to one, which officially classifies as a [[gangbang]]. However, Paultards seized control of the state, as an army of angry whores descended on the Republican state convention, castrated all the McCain supporters, and proceeded to elect a cadre of Vegas showgirls to the national convention. The 30 strippers intend to personally demo "freedom" by giving free lap dances to everyone there until they vote for Paul.

==Ron Paul and Scientology==
[[Image:COSless_than_three_Ron_Paul.png|thumb|Paultards cream their jeans over Scientology.]]
'''The 'Church' of [[$]]cientlology''' backs L. Ron Paul for many reasons, but mainly because, L. Ron has promised to abolish the [[IRS]] ([[Chanology|since they will soon lose their tax exempt status]]). They also get hard for his stance on 'mental health' since they don't believe in [[Psychiatry]] and [[Prozac]] and Ron doesn't believe in [[niggardly|spending money]] on frivolous stuff like [[e-meter|mental health screenings]].

A "Chicago OTC, CCHR all hands call" from the "Chicago OT Committee" of 3 May 2008 was posted to the news group on 3 May, excerpts of which follow:

===All Hands On Deck!===

"Dear OT Committee Members,

Please read what follows. There is a very important event taking place on the 18th in Washington. Three congressmen are going to speak out on their opposition to mental health screening. CCHR supporters from across the country are flying into Washington to attend this forum and then go and speak to their individual congressmen and senators. If there is any possible way that you can attend this vital event, do it.

'''SETTING APPOINTMENTS WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS''' DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS!

'''FIND YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS''': If you are unfamiliar with whom your Members of Congress are, go to www.congress.org. Under 'Write Elected Officials' there's a place to type in your zip code and your Representative and two Senators for your state will come up as well as the President. (You may be required to give your 9-digit zip code, so have this handy.) If you click the 'info' link under each Member's name, it will give you the phone numbers for contacting them. (If you don't have Internet access, call the Capitol Hill Switchboard at 202-224-3121 and ask for the Representative of your district and the two Senators for your state and how to contact them).

Talk to the Appointment Secretary: Call each and ask for the Appointment Secretary. Because you are a constituent visiting Capitol Hill from your home state, you want to visit the Member if at all possible instead of just a congressional aide. Tell the Appointment Secretary that you're looking at meeting the Congressman or Senator some time between 12:00 P.M. and 4:30 P.M. on May 18th. Tell them you're only going to be in town for that one day only. Be persistent, but polite. It may help to mention titles you may have, such as doctor, lawyer, CEO of your company or other impressive data. If there is just no way for him/her to meet with you, then see if you can meet the Legislative Director. If that's a no-go, then go for the Legislative Assistant that deals with Health or Education issues.

The president of The Citizens Commission on Human Rights for the United States has written the following alert to help stop the funding for the mental health screening program. Please read this and the attachment by our Government Affairs Director. Then please modify and fax the attached letter to your Congressman, etc.

[SAMPLE CONGRESSIONAL LETTER ON H.R. 181]

The Honorable (name) ____ March/April 2005
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515


Dear Representative ______________,

I am writing to ask you to please co-sponsor H.R. 181, the 'Parental Consent Act of 2005,' sponsored by Representatives Ron Paul and Tom Feeney. I am asking this as your constituent. I am extremely alarmed at the prospect of universal mental health screening in the schools, something the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (NFC) has recommended. I implore you to take a leadership role in defense of our children and parents and in support of the true mission of schools by signing onto and working for passage of H.R. 181, which will prohibit federal funding of any kind of universal mental health screening. ..."

===Proof that Ron Paul is in the pockets of the cult of [[$]]cientology===
Thank you for contacting my office. I am always happy when the people of the 14th district of Texas take the time to let me know where they stand on important issues facing the country.

I understand your concerns about Scientology. However, I do not favor revoking Scientology's tax-exemption because I oppose raising federal taxes on any individual or group, even when I disagree with elements of that group's political agenda. The precedent of tax-exempt revocation may some day be used to justify raising taxes on other tax-exempt groups, including religious organizations.

Thanks again for writing. Please do not hesitate to contact my office with any other questions, comments, or suggestions.

Sincerely,

Ron Paul

Prepare for incoming drama that could possibly lead to the Paul campaign's implosion. On second thought, if you vote for Ron Paul why would you care about <strike>a few</strike> an assload of Nazis?

But of course LGF is full of shit, because even Don Black admits Ron Paul isn't a white supremacist, just that he is the very best candidate for white supremacists on all the issues.[http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showpost.php?p=4203699&postcount=27] [[Oh ok]].

Also last Thursday, some self-righteous Neocon bloggers showed their true colors (hint: [[piss]]) and decided that the best way to handle Ron Paul was to tell his supporters to [[STFU]]. Leon H. Wolf, who advocates dropping bombs on brown people to "civilize" them, has dedicated his life to [[ban|banning]] any and all "code pinks" from his website. This is likely due to how he hasn't seen a woman's [[vagina|pink]] since his mom gave him a freebie a few years ago.[http://www.redstate.com/blogs/leon_h_wolf/2007/oct/22/attention_ron_paul_supporters_life_is_really_not_fair]

==Kitna2Furfag==

And again last Thursday, [http://www.strawpoll08.com StrawPoll08] banned any mention of Ron Paul from its site.[http://www.strawpoll08.com/ronpaul.htm] While supposedly "non-partisan," it's owner is actually Kitna2Furrey, a [[furfag]] who loves the Detroit Lions like [[Daveykins]] loves Sonic the Hedgehog.

{{quote|Paul supporters are only capable of:
1.Saying Ron Paul, Ron Paul, Ron Paul over and over.
2.Talking about moonbat conspiracy crap.
3.Insulting anyone who doesn't like Paul, and saying they must hate liberty, freedom and The Constitution.
4.Basically not being able to contribute anything meaningful to an online discussion.|Kitna2Furrey}}

[http://www.detroitlions.name/ Kitna2Furfag] [http://www.detroittigers.name/] proceeded to [[Delete fucking everything|delete]] every trace of Paul from the site, even programming a script to delete any mention of Ron Paul from the site's online chat and only making the chat available between 9 AM and 9 PM. Kitna now dedicates his entire day to doing nothing but seeking out Paul supporters who may be lurking on his page and banning them when they speak, making him just as batshit insane as the Paultards he sought to fight. Eventually, he removed the chat altogether. It's expected his entire site will soon become [[an hero]].

== Ron Paul is the anti-racist ==
[[Image:Ron_paul_antiracist.jpg |thumb|right|200px|Ron Paul isn't racist.  YOU are.]]

Ron Paul recently appeared on CNN to say that he isn't [[not racist|teh racist]], he is [[racist|teh "anti-racist"]].  Ron Paul [[lie|loves teh black people, and black people love Ron Paul!]]  So the next time someone tells that Ron Paul isn't racist, reply by saying, "You're right, he's [[Racist|the anti-racist]]!" and then lol.  An anti-racist has different motivations from a traditional racist, but his function within the story is still the same:

<b>Racist</b>: I would like to reinstate slavery, because I <i>hate</i> black people.
<b><i>Anti</i>-Racist</b>: I would like to reinstate slavery, because I <i>love</i> black people.

This reasoning worked so well, that Paul "won" third place in the [[Louisiana]], by appealing to the supporters of David Duke.  Unfortunately, Ron Paul was still no match for the first place finisher, "Uncommitted/Pro-Life."

Back when a couple of people gave a shit, Ron was criticized for not voting to give a Congressional medal or rims, or somefuckingthing to supa-[[nigra]], Rosa Parks. This is because the right to give medals is like totally not in teh Constitutioneez. Though it is worth noting only a black woman could be considered for a medal by sitting down and not getting up. 

=== Martin Luther King money drive, January 21st ===
Millions of World of Warcraft, EverQuest, RuneScape, MapleStory [[basement dwellers|fans]] decided to celebrate the memory of Dr. King by donating their farmed gold to Ron Paul's campaign, as if to say, "Yes, he deserved to die, and I hope he burns in hell!" -all of which makes perfect sense, considering Ron Paul's 'No' vote on establishing MLK Day as a National Holiday. LOL. [[Image:Ron_Paul_Not_Racist_LOL.jpg|thumb|Paultards get batshit crazy if you mention this...]].

== How Ron Paul will FUBAR the 2008 Republican Primaries ==
[[Image:Ronpaulbaby.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Babies love Ron Paul, because they share the same level of social awareness.]]

For the past 2 centuries, primary elections have reliably put forward reliable and milquetoast candidates that will carry a party's torch in the general election. A candidate's success in primary elections will usually rely a handful of loyalists in each state showing up... Howard Dean imploded in 2004 simply because most [[retard|college students]] and [[idiot|baby boomers]] couldn't tell a primary from their elbow. ([[Protip]]:They still can't.)

At this moment, Ron Paul has nearly 3% support in national telephone polls. The only people who don't hang up on pollsters are retards and the elderly, and coincidentally, these are also the type of people who typically vote in primary elections. Fortunately for Paultards, there's another outlet for their opinion, one that allows them to practice for the upcoming primaries: the "straw poll," which allows politically minded folk to get together, drink beer, and conduct an imaginary election. These are usually bland and predictable affairs. However, thanks to the internet, any modern straw poll will be witness to a grand invasion of Paultards. Rather than allow Paul to win time and time again, straw polls nationwide [http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/SF_Straw_Poll_Cancelled_Too_Many_Ron_Paul_Supporters_2 are being canceled] en masse, and poll results are being nullified by organizers.

If you thought John Kerry was a surprise nominee last election, you ain't seen nothing yet. In that case, you had a bunch of disaffected elderly folk voting for one of their own. This time around, you've got rabid cultists who will tattoo the date of their primaries to the inside of their eyelids. Since GOP brass will simply not allow a war dove to carry the party nomination, you can expect plenty of drama as state primary election results are blatantly rejected by delegates to this year's republican convention.

===The primaries: Epic fail===
[[Image:RonPaulBurg.jpg|thumb|250px|Ron Paul's brilliant campaign coming to an end.]]
Paul placed fifth (10%) in the [[Iowa]] caucus behind [[John McCain]] (13%) and [[Fred Thompson]] (13%). [http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/state/#IA] This has dejected many Paultards and sums up what most already know: Ron Paul's campaign is [[epic fail]]. However, this will not stop hordes of Paultards from shouting "electoral fraud" en masse or blaming people such as the mainstream media, the neo-cons, the liberals, or the Jews.

In other news, [[Rudy Giuliani]] got sixth place at 4%. Come on, he got beaten by Ron Paul? That's fucking sad. 911 LOLs for Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani should have dressed in drag, maybe he would have gotten more votes.

In [[New Hampshire]], Pron Haul placed sixth with only 8% of the vote. It was simply another epic fail for Paul and his batshit insane fans- who as usual, refused to accept reality. Upon learning that a small-town clerk had accidentally recorded zero votes for Paul (instead of the whopping 31 he actually got), the Paulbots decided that this constituted proof of 'vote fraud'.  [[internet tough guys|Paultards]] mobilized from coast to coast, calling the town clerk responsible on the phone at her office and home for days on end to scream at her.
[http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080112/FRONTPAGE/801120412/1043/NEWS01]

In [[Florida]], Paul got 3%, which sums up what most already know. Ron Paul is simply unelectable. Paultards already began preparing for a Ron Paul 2012 campaign, but as every good Paultard knows, the [http://www.apocalypse2012.com/us/ world will end in 2012].

Ron Paul is considering teaming up with Democrat Zell Miller to form the bizarro land anti-candidate ticket. He is currently polling strongly with evil twins and legal immigrants from alternate universes.

==BREAKING NEWZZZZZZZ==
"Ron Paul is currently polling the strongest in Tennessee with 9 percent since Fred Thompson dropped out of the race. After that is California and New Jersey, states he is polling about 7 percent, and Oklahoma with 6 percent"

Clearly the man has just about reached his peak! Maybe by the time the REAL election is over he just might break into double digits! By the claws of [[Death Cat]]! What does he spend all that money on?

==MOAR BREAKING NEWZZZZZZZ==
[[Image:Ron_Paul_CAN_HAZ_RECOUNT_2.jpg|thumb|No, Crazy Uncle- you may not.]]
IT'S OVER! Ron Paul is scaling back his campaign to focus on his reelection to the congress of Texas. There, the Libertarian liberation movement will regroup for further [[fail|failure]] next election cycle. Clearly, this man was defeated by a [[Fox News|biased media]].

[[Aspies]] all over the world must now find [[masturbation|new ways]] to while away the hours in their lonely, empty lives.

However, there is hope for more lulz, as all candidates who have won delegates (which includes Paul with his awe-inspiring total of 16) are allowed to speak at the GOP national convention. 10-to-1 his speech will be cut short with a gong (more like dong amirite?).

==The Revolution recoups in a (small part) of Texas==
[[Image:Ronpaulirl.jpg|thumb|right|Pictured: Ron Paul supporters of voting age]]
{{quote|There's still hope for Dr. Paul! The media will support a true defender of freedom! What? He only got <10% of the vote? It's a media conspiracy!|Typical Paulfag}}
Ron Paul has been so busy spreading crazy across The Net and IRL that he has neglected his own congressional district! The only reason he [[in the ass|pulled out]] before either real political party finalized their nominee was to save his own piddly 12th district of Texas. Although he has 32 points in polling over challenger Chris Peden, there is still a possibility the Ron cannot hold the crazy after his long, sustained failgasm. It may just pour out of him like [[cum|milk]] from the teats of a [[GoddessMillenia|lulzcow]]. Also, he has joined a new [http://www.falangist.com/beliefs1.htm political party] after much bawwwwwwing about how the republicans are meanies!!

==Exodus: The founding of a new (sovereign) nation! ==
[[Image:Paulville_aka_Paultardistan.jpg|thumb|right| Coming soon: Paultardistan, USA]]
Meanwhile, in another small part of Texas, [[butthurt|embittered]] Paultards are building a gated compound- uh, I mean, a [[pool's closed|'gated community']] named (wait for it...!) [[Gay|PAULVILLE]]. Yeah, you read correctly. No doubt an homage to ''Smallville'' because Dr. Paul is like Superman to his [[retards|followers]]. The website says "The goal of [http://paulville.org/index.html Paulville.org] it (sic) to establish gated communities containing [[hivemind|100% Ron Paul supporters]] and or [[White_people|people]] that live by the ideals of [[racism|freedom and liberty]]", though they warn "These communities are [[DAMN NIGGA]] (sic)". The whole affair appears to be organized along the lines of a [[hippies|co-op]] and is located somewhere near [[Waco|Waco]]. Given the general level of batshit-crazy that will consolidate there, this probably [[Party Van|won't end well]], will it?

{{quote|"I don't mind playing a key role in this [[circle jerk|revolution]], but it has to be more than a Ron Paul revolution. Our job now is to plan for the next [[final_solution|phase]]."|Cap'n Crazy!}}

After regaining the trailer park spawning pit commonly referred to in gurglespeak as "Texas' 12th District", Ron Paul planned... for us, for the future, and for the next generation of babies he will personally deliver into this world with his magic hands.

Using [[Bullshit|inspiring language]], Project "Winding Down" will feature Paul continuing to travel, addressing largely-empty echo chambers filled with his supporters from mother's basements around the world. He will pass Libraterian nuggets from his asshole and encourage [[Pot|grass-roots activism]] to influence the process and "Return the Republican Party to its traditions of limited government and personal freedom". His method; [[bisexual|bi-lateral]] [[gangbang|cooperation]] between the arch troglodyte right with the extreme "sand-in-the-vagina left". Ron Paul should be upgraded from [[DivineAngel|Lulzcow]] to a whole freaking [[DeviantArt|Lulzfarm]].

He also wrote a book, which his followers have bought in mass quantities. This made it #1 on the [[lies|New York Times]] bestsellers list, extending the trolling to even greater heights! In buying the book in such large groups, though, the Paultards proved they're really [[Scientologists]] in disguise.

==Ron Paul 2: The Sequel==

[[A challenger appears]]! With Paul out, his followers have latched onto a new idol to work themselves into a froth over: Bob Barr. Barr's already working to kneecap John McCain with a lead pipe, currently getting 6% nationally - enough to make [[Ralph Nader]] green with envy (ha ha, pun).

==Rand Paul==
[[File:Randpaulmilitia1.jpg|thumb|right|Rand Paul fans enjoy compensating for their small dicks, virginity, and irrevocable [[basement-dweller]] status with big guns.]]
[[File:Randpaulforums.png|thumb|left|Rand Paul fans apparently enjoy [[bestiality|dog porn]] and [[incest]].]]

The next generation of Paultardery, Rand Paul, is the 
<del> GOP nominee for Senate</del> [[OMG|Senator Elect]] in [[Kentucky]], proving that Kentucky is just as fucked up and backwards as Texas. Much like his dad, Rand Paul does not particularly care for [[black people|negroes]] and went on record opposing civil rights bills because of their [[Shit nobody cares about|BLATANT UNCONSTITUTIONALITY!!!!!]].  But he would have marched with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], making him an anti-racist, just like his father.

Recently, his [[tea party]] thugs, curb-stomped a Liberal woman, stay classy!
