==What is Delaware?==

A glorified rest stop on the I-95 freeway, Delaware is a tiny, flat, [[shit|shitty]], polluted state in the middle of buttfuck nowhere that [[shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about]]. Although its official state slogan emphasizes its one claim to fame of being the "First US State" (as its state delegates accidentally happened to be the first ones to sign the Constitution in [[9/11|1820]] while everyone else was still enjoying their tea and [[Delicious Cake|crumpets]]), it's better known for being the place where [[negro|negroes]] stop for [[KFC]] on their way to sell [[Florida]] [[cocaine]] in [[New York]] as well as where white, inbred [[Philadelphia]] Eagles fans live.

Delaware also has [[Homosexual|Rehomo]] Beach, which is popular with [[fags|lifelong bachelors]] and [[college]] students.

Also of note is that Delaware State's URL is [[desu]].edu.  Lulz.

Anthropologists in other states refer to DeSU as "Little Africa" due to the wide variety of negro breeds and sub-types seen there.

==People==
One half of the state is filled with [[redneck|rednecks]] and other white trash, one half is filled with [[wiggers]], while the other half is populated by [[negro|colored types]]. The primary function of DeSU is to instruct its students in basic reading skills and some elementary principles of arithmetic. It's important to note that Delaware is three halves in a two-half state - it's fairly amazing!
