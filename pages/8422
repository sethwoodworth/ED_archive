Tim McLean was a 22 year old [[juggalo]] who had his existence corrected while riding on a greyhound bus on the night of July 30, 2008. On his way to Winnipeg after working at the carnival (probably the [[ICP|Dark Carnival]]), McLean made the unfortunate mistake of changing seats at a rest stop, so that he was seated beside [[Vince Weiguang Li]]. Though the two never spoke, Li suddenly realized that McLean was a juggalo. Thinking quickly, he decided to do a service to Canada and stabbed him dozens of times with a large hunting knife. Li was greeted by applause from the entire bus as he hacked off McLean's head and removed it from his body, where he presented it to the bus driver for a medal and a key to the city. Though Li is currently awaiting trial for the murder, his lawyer is working diligently to get him off on an insanity plea. We're rooting for you [[Vince Weiguang Li]]!

==[[God Hates Fags|God Hates Tim McLean]]==
Tim McLean has truly died for our [[lulz]]. Because the murder of this [[juggalo]] proves that [[God Hates Fags|God Hates]] [[Canada]], and because the Canada does not tolerate their brand of [[faggotry]], the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] and [[Fred Phelps]] have recently announced that they applaud the death of Tim McLean, and to celebrate, they are going to [[troll]] [http://www.godhatesfags.com/written/fliers/20080805_headless-canadian-funeral.pdf his funeral] [[IRL]]. It is unknown what this has to do with [[Fred Phelps]]'s closet homosexuality, but it is likely that Phelps is just using this grave pissing opportunity as a shot at [[moar]] [[shameless self promotion]].

==Troll==
The only way one can muster the most efficient form of [[lulz]] is from the people who praise his death. That is why we have a civic duty to troll his fans and anyone that yells out RIP TIM MCLEAN WE LOVE YOU IN OUR HEARTS. Here are some fine examples of people that do not like to be trolled. Especially on [[Facebook|Failbook]].
{{quote|HEY YOU LITTLE DIRTY ASS MOTHER FUCKING MEXICAN. HOW ABOUT THIS...YOU COME TO WINNIPEG [[Internet Tough Guy | SAY THAT IN FRONT OF MY FACE AND SEE WHERE IT GETS YOU]].

I hope YOU have an unnoticed and painful death you son of a bitch!|Amanda Baldwin, one of the lost [[retarded]] step brothers of the Baldwin brothers found on facebook.}}
If you want to generate some cheap lulz at the expense of Tim McLean fans, just go to a vigil on the one-year anniversary of his death - like [http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/confrontation-mars-quiet-vigil-52166902.html this guy] - and tell McLean's family and friends "Li is a victim" and that "he should not be caged up and treated like an animal." Also note that the article states that his life was [[Lulz|"Cut short"]]
