'''EVAR''', which is commonly misspelled "ever", is a word that has something to do with time. Derived words include forevar and [[nevar]].

==History==
The term was frequently used at [[SomethingAwful]], where [[JeffK]] often wrote "EVAR!!1" to emphasize his point.  It was subsequently picked up by [[LJ]] [[fags]] like [[Jameth]] and Catsluvdmb in unsuccessful attempts at funny.  Currently in mainstream use by [[16 year old girls]] to inform you that <s>the newest [[Twilight]] book is bestest bewk EVAR!!!!!!!!!!!!![[1]]</s> they [[nevar]] read EVAR.

==Usage==
EVAR is mandatorily preceded by a superlative (often "best" or "bestest") and a noun phrase, is fully capitalized, and is followed by no less than three <s>explanation</s> exclamation points. It is often used because [[W|No Child Left Behind]] has reduced the emphasis on spelling, so children don't know how to spell let alone know that this is a run on sentence and [[Shit nobody cares about|instead there is too much emphasis put on Standardized Testing which requires no effort at all other than filling in a little empty circle with a #2 Pencil.]]

==Official use of the word==
* [http://news.livejournal.com/90961.html LJ News uses EVAR as an entry title.]
*Usually in CAPS

==Epic use of the word==
*At end of very important sentence: "He shall be encased in carbonite fo' EVAR!!!
*As part of another word: "nEVAR", "forEVAR", "howEVAR".
*As a tool to feel obnoxious when [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Texting texting] to friends.
*WhenEVAR you fucking feel like, dammit.
