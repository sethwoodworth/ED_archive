The '''Insurgency Wiki''' is <s>insurgen</s> partyvan.info, a [[wiki]] specializing in [[raid]] coordination and documentation. It is home to many [[Anonymous|Anonymi]], [[raidfag]]s, [[i/|/i/nsurgents]], [[vandal]]s, and [[script kiddies]], and functions as a centralized hub for the aforementioned degenerates to use to reign [[terror]] on the [[Internets|webs]].  In their own words, "''Was put together and run so that the newfags can just read stuff here instead of it needing to be explained tons of times in the chat.'' At one point, there were two wikis ran at once: Insurgen.info and partyvan.info, and for a while purely insurgen.info due to Partyvan's [[shit|Titanic-like]] uptime, but now it is down to just partyvan.info.

==History==
===Partyvan.info===
This became the primary domain of the /i/nsurgency wiki some time in 2008 (before that the w/i/ki used dyndns), after which some fags colloquialized it to "Partyvan Wiki".  That said, it was and is and (probably) will be correct to call it the /i/nsurgency wiki.

====Stuffs====

The site is named after the phrase "partyvan," the [[Chan]]ese word for [[FBI]].  Since most of its users have to live in constant fear of being [[v&]] by [[The Man]] and would readily nuke their hard drives at a moment's notice, the title is rather fitting.

The "Raiding Wiki" was started back in June [[2007]], but was basically an unused collection of failure until a couple months later, when the wiki was [[irony|finally hosted on a semi-stable webhost, which it turns out was an eMachine 633 IDS on comcast cable]].  Around this time, the site began to see a surge in [[Original content|content]] and users, and became a pretty useful place to find raid information.  The wiki has since gone up and down more than a [[professional]] [[whore]], due mostly to a number of HD crashes and a constant barrage of [[DDoS]] attacks from every corner of the internet.  

Originally partyvan.info died in 2009 for six months out of the blue with no explanation but hinting that someone hacked them during the last week before it went down.  Then, months later, it finally returned again. It is expected to be dead again <s>next week</s> <s>tomorrow</s> [[dead|R.I.P]].

Other Wikis, like (insurgen.cc/.info), are sometimes called a ripoff or vice-versa, but this debate is an [[E-penis]] measuring contest and nothing more, since the people that '''actually wrote''' the articles are, in many case, long gone.

===Insurgen.info===
Not to be confused with [[Partyvan Wiki]], insurgen.info was ran by [[r3x]], owner of [[888chan]] and [[888chan#Epic_Fail_Guys_Wiki|The Epic Fail Guys Wiki]].  It was up for a while, while partyvan.info was down, but it now appears permanently debunk.  Moreover, r3x has suggested that--if all things go well--insurgen.info might be pointed at partyvan.info.

====Background====
[http://insurgen.info Insurgen.info] was formed after the 'recovery' of partyvan sql files a few months ago. When [[Janus Zeal]], owner of  domain and host of the wiki, lost his job during the economic downturn, the wiki went down, and Relentless--who was paying him for hosting the wiki--turned to [[r3x]] for help. r3x and Relentless jointly ran the [[wiki]] at insurg.in for a while, which was also accessible from partyvan.info as janus zeal pointed the domain to it.

Things ran smoothly, until Relentless tried to initiate a forceful takeover of z103 (a radio-station r3x also hosted) with the help of [[anonnet]] [[k-line|oper abuse]] from mooncup. Relentless was subsequently kicked off r3x’s box and r3x continued running the wiki on his own. Due to past [[drama|conflicts]] between janus zeal and r3x, best described [[888chan#Happy_Anniversary|here]], janus zeal stopped directing partyvan.info to the Insurgency Wiki, and it is this conflict which is said to have caused the current splintering in the wiki continuation. While r3x’s wiki was accessible from insurgen.cc, janus zeal chose to point partyvan.info to a new wiki, set up by some newfags named mooncup and Pedrobear. 

Thus, where there was once just one [[Anonymous]] wiki, there became (for the sake of ED simplicity) two: '''Partyvan''' (Partyvan.info) '''Wiki''' and '''Insurgency''' (Insurgen.cc/info) '''Wiki'''.

====Tension====
[[File:SurfboardForwardRollup281.jpg|thumb|Partyvan vs. Insurgen]]
Whilst [[Partyvan]] disliked insurgen.cc (now insurgen.info) because of r3x and his association with [[888chan]], in particular its inclusion of a controversial [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY|/xenu/]] board, Insurgency Wiki disliked Partyvan because of the way they exclude certain sectors of the [[I|insurgency]] through weak accusations of [[moralfag|moralfaggotry]], feeling that this weakens the whole and loses sight of the ultimate goal; [[lulz]].

====partyvan'D====
A while ago, the wiki was partyvan'd or DDOSed or something. And as a result of that, some h@ck0rz on steroidz backed up the wiki <s>[http://innominate0.org/ion/nsurgent.innominate0.org/insurgen.info/wiki/Main_Page.html to this page]</s>.  It's dead.

====Resolution?====
The people running partyvan.info have now changed, and is largely back to the same administration that was in charge prior to the drama that led up to the initial split.  Moreover, insurgen.info appears likely to never recover, so partyvan.info has ''de facto'' become the primary /i/nsurgency wiki.

==Infos==
Raid information is collected and cataloged in only the most [[serious]] of manners, as the users take their hobbies of [[Hacker|hackan]], [[troll]]an, [[spam]]man, and [[raid]]an very [[srsly]].

Unlike [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], the Insurgency Wiki not only allows, but encourage a number of hazardous practices, such as the posting of [[dox|personal info]], detailed planning of raids, and step-by-step instructions on how to harm the target at hand; the kind of things that a normal site would instantly disdain in [[Creepypasta|fear]].  However, [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody really knows or cares]] about The Insurgent Wiki, so it doesn't really matter.

However, in a fashion similar to that of [[ED]], neither tolerate [[X is not your personal army|Personal Army]] requests.  Really, nobody on the internet wants to help you get revenge on your ex-girlfriend.

==Burritos==
Partyvan has way too many "[[Mexico|Burritos]]" (Bureaucrats).  Some are:

*'''[[User:SHANKSNET|NekoArc]]''' - [[weeaboo]] who runs the [[List_of_chan_boards#NekoArc Network|NekoArc Network]]
*'''riverofdicks''' - huge "troll"
*'''[[User:Janus zeal|Janus zeal]]''' - disgraced former ED [[SysOp]], loldongs
*'''[[User:Rolantloss|Relentless]]''' - some other black person that is a huge [[faggot]] (literally)
*'''[[User:Hitlerlol|Hitlerlol]]''' - spent too much time editing since 2007
