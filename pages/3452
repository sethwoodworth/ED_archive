Goth macros
[http://community.livejournal.com/goth_macros/ Goth_Macros] is a [[liveJournal]] community set up  in June 2007 and is the home of many funny pictures taking the piss out of goths. It is mostly populated by goths who actually have a sense of humour and has a highly enlighten approach to how a community should work:
{{squote|NSFW cuts just encourage whining retards. If siani_hedgehog is in a bad mood, a really good mood, or drinking, she is likely to delete anything under one. BECAUSE SHE HATES YOU.

How to get banned:

• being a dickhead
• deleting comments
• pissing off the mods

The moderators are bastards and will rule precisely as they see fit. It's our ball, and if you don't like it, you can fuck off."}}

==[[Dncingmalkavian]] Drama==
[[Image:Dncbucket.jpg|thumb|150px| macro of controversy by [[user:clintiskeen|clintiskeen]]]]
On April 25th, 2008, the livejournal user [[Dncingmalkavian]] entered into a whole world of [[butthurt]] and infamy. Someone found [http://community.livejournal.com/gothic_babes/8443319.html a series of pics of her] on the [[http://community.livejournal.com/gothic_babes Gothic Babes]] camera-whore community. Initially, dncingmalkavian "claimed" that she was being a [http://community.livejournal.com/goth_macros/421326.html?thread=4138446#t4138446 "a pretty good sport about this whole thing"] until the infamous livejournal user [[user:clintiskeen|clintiskeen]] posted his walrus macro, unleashing the wrath of a [[Goth]][[fatty]].


[[Dncingmalkavian]] believes herself to be an [[E-lawyer]], and due to her vast knowledge of [[internet law]] she made the following decree:

Sadly for her argument proceeded to fail epically, with this being the precise point of pwnage:

Needless to say the quiet and reserved members of the community resisted all temptation to make further macros of her pictures after her repeated sobs of misfortune:

==But wait! That's not all!==


Then the secret was revealed- She Is [[Drama_queen|actually an Amazonian]]! (and not just a [[Goth]][[fatty]])

Monday the 28th came and went, with not a hint of the LJ-Abuse Gestapo in sight. Where have all the internet lawyers gone? Was goth_macros finally safe from the long hard tusk of the law? It seems the answer is NO. [[Dncingmalkavian]] was a very sneaky walrus, and had planned her attack for Friday the 2nd to spread confusion!

And then... Nothing happened. Bitch fucked off. Go Team Evil!
