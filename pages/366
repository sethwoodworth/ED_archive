All Your Base Are Belong To Us
{{Template:WP80navsmall}}
[[Image:Einsteinayb.jpg|thumb|[[Einstein]] created All Your Base [[at least 100 years ago]]]]

'''All Your Base''' is one of the oldest of [[old memes]] that has literally been around for [[at least 100]] [[Last_thursday|Thursdays]] [http://p210.ezboard.com/flakesideviewfrm8.showMessage?topicID=2553.topic]. In fact, it is so fucking old that it has Life Alert. It is a culmination of the efforts of many websites and forums, including [[Something Awful]] and [[Fark]]. [[Japanese]] game company Toaplan created a space shooter entitled ''Zero Wing'' and SNK imported it into [[Europe]] with a ridiculously bad [[Engrish]] translation. Years later, the [[Internet]] found it and [[photoshop]]ped various [[catchphrases]] from the intro onto everyday items. 

The meme is so ancient and [[gay|powerful]] that it has spawned many smaller memes, which are now so ubiquitous that they are not even recognizable (i.e. "[[For great justice]]!").  It has also been turned into the pussy dance level of FlashFlashRevolution, a shitty rip-off of [[DDR]] using arrowkeys and the [[internetz]]. Great for fatties too lazy to just step on the arrows.  Imagine the look on her face. 

==In A.D. 2001, Meme was beginning ==

Several people dubbed their voices over the intro in an overly dramatic fashion, and eventually most of the Photoshopped images were gathered by Bad_CRC and incorporated into a flash movie that every [[veteran]] of the Internet has seen by now. It should be noted that AYBABTU (as it is affectionately acronymed) has slid so far into the negative zone of comedy that quoting the exchange is now legally considered justification for assault and murder, which is the punishment soon to be faced by the creators of the [[MSN]] bot, Encarta[[Copyright|®]] Instant Answers.
