'''Azer Red''', formerly '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Rouge_Rosado&diff=91506139&oldid=86978592 Rouge Rosado]''' is a [[butthurt]] [[Wikipedophile]] who has made it her goal to [[shutdownED.org|shut down Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. A [[fangirl]] of [[fail|famous]] Wikimediots [[cunt|Zoe]] and [[Sceptre]], [[attention whore|she would like everyone to know]] that she does not approve of the [[lulz]], in full accordance with [[WP:DNLAED|official Wikipedia policy]]. 

Alkivar fails to [[sex|make her happy]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=97594194]. Obviously, she needs [[moar]] [[friends]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/American_Nihilist_Underground_Society_%283rd_nomination%29&diff=prev&oldid=96580866]. 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Azer_Red/ED_discussion_page Here was the ED attack page she started] and [http://www.nwnwiki.org/User:Azer_Red/ED_evidence_page this was the evidence page] on a crappy Neverwinter Nights Wiki until the admins there deleted it as Wikipedia spam!

Big fat [[Cyde]] tried to send her an sekkrit "shut up fgt" email, but [[noone]] at TOW can figure out how teh internets [[tubes]] works. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Azer_Red/Archive_2#Email_2]  Meanwhile, TOW has forbidden links to ED via Red's ghey "evidence page"--LOL!

And now the attack [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Azer_Red/ED_discussion_page page] on [[TOW]] has been [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:Azer_Red/ED_discussion_page ED'd]! Oh, the irony.
