==Genesis kills the NES==

It became apparent to every fag working at Nintendo, that their Nintendo Entertainment System was an old piece of shit. At first Nintendo did not care, until a company called Sega began making the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]]. The Sega Genesis was extremely fast for [[Good_spelling|it's]] day, and it showed while [[Chris Chan|retarded children played their Sonic the Hedgehog]] on it, Nintendo fags would have to play with a [[Mario|gay italian midget plumber]] (no, I don't mean [[Ray_william_johnson|Ray William Johnson]]). This created much drama and lulz between the Sega and Nintendo nerds, arguing about who is the best idol, a furry Hedgehog on ecstasy or some fag with asperger syndrom always shouting out loud "IT'S ME MARIO".

==The Arrival of the '''Super Nintendo'''==

Nintendo finally manned up, and grew a pair. Finally deciding to work on [[Good_spelling|it's]] own 16 bit console, it would take [[at least 100 years]] to build it. The birth of the Super Nintendo is always a debate for Nintendo fan-boys. Some believe that Miyamoto himself impregnated a lonely ROB the ROBOT. Still others believe that the Super Nintendo was first formed when a NES reached [[Good_spelling|it's]] breaking point, while fighting Frieza on planet Namek. Of course, this is all purely dogma written by superstitious niggers, wearing 1-UP T-shirts.

==Backwards Compatibility==
The SNES became the first console where anyone actually cared whether it played previous games. This worked in Nintendo's favor, because if a little kid went to the store to get a new Nintendo Entertainment System he was sure to cluster fuck his mom into getting him it.
==Games==
Many games were released for the Super Nintendo. Including Super Mario Bros. World, Mario kart, FF6, and Donkey Kong [[Cunt]]ry. Other games are significantly less interesting.

==Emulation and Nintendo Backwards Compatibility==
Emulation for the SNES format is very popular, almost every game on the SNES has a ROM somewhere. However, Nintendo decided that backwards compatibility no longer mattered with the N64 and the Gamecube. This did not result in 
[[lulz]].  Nintendo is currently mooching off of the success of their old games, with a full frontal assault on nintendo fanboys. The Wii has downloadable content available via "virtual console", a fancy way of saying an [[Emulator]] that costs money, while at the same time they continue to sell rehashed Super Nintendo games on the GBA/DS. Also cocks.
