{{Forced Meme}}

"Kirby Rage" or "kirbyraeg.jpg" is a [[forced meme]] that originated on [[jailbaitgallery.com|7chan]], and shortly thereafter leaked to [[shit nobody cares about|4chan]]. It started when a [[samefag]] spammed the same image [[IT'S_OVER_9000|over 9000]] times to sagebomb threads (or, more commonly, just flood them for [[troll|no fucking reason]]). As is the way on 4chan, additional shoops were soon created, mostly for the intent of trolling.
<br>
<br>
About a week after kirbyraeg.jpg started being spammed, the moderators of [[7chan]] set up the picture at the top of /b/, as well as renamed everyone to "KIRBY" instead of Anonymous. Because of this, kirbyraeg is often believed to be the work of mods in order to troll the users of their own imageboard.
<br>
<br>
On 5/2/08, when a [[moot|huge faggot]] took /b/ down, kirbyraeg was mass spammed on almost every fucking 4chan board, most notably /a/, which was already being raided by /b/tard refugees.
