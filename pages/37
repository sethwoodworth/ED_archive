'''14/f/Cali''', or "fourteen-year-old girl from [[California]]" for the internets-illiterate, is the generic response to any [[ASL]] question. Of course, it is to be taken with a pinch of salt and a lot of [[spam]]ming, as everyone knows that all teenagers are either [[13-year-old boy]]s or [[16-year-old girl]]s and women are [[Retard|technologically impaired]]. So that makes their identity obvious, doesn't it boys and... boys?

== Teh 14/f/Cali action plan ==
So some [[cockmongler]] has identified themselves as 14/f/Cali? Never fear, [[Encyclopediadramatica|ED]] is here! This foolproof action plan will save you from [[e]]-[[faggot]]ry:

# Don't panic -- "14 year old female Californians" can smell fear.
# Quickly look for that shock image you've been storing for that special occasion. (If you don't have one, use [[pain series]])
# Use a [[spam]]ming bot to clog up the offender's inbox/conversation window. Problem solved!

===What not to do===
*Anything not specified in the plan. Otherwise you lose at the internets by default, you [[fuck]]ing [[n00b]].
