====Rules====
Read this! http://www.counterpunch.org/bacher07292003.html
:Know the 22 rules set out by Anonymous
:masks are ok as long as it is not a gas mask 
:No glass containers of any kind.
:signs must be made of cloth, paper, or cardboard under 1/4 inch thickness 
:picket signs cant have a handle of more than 1/4 inch thickness and 2 inches width. if it is not a rectangle, it cant be more than 3/4 inches in thickness at the thickest point. both ends must be blunt and not pointed 
:Protip: If attacked/confronted by a Scientologist, sit down ('''but''' if a cop then tells you you're blocking the sidewalk, move so that you're not [http://www.qcode.us/codes/sacramento/view.php?topic=12-12_24-12_24_110]). Either the Scientologist will move on or look like a bully attacking some sitting down person. You cannot reason with them, they are basically brainwashed.

====Church info====

It's a one story building. The front door faces 15th street. There is a back door into their parking lot in the alley off 15th street. 

Their probable "handler" of you will be a douchebag named Mike Klagenburg. He's short and dumpy with brown hair and glasses and in his late 40s.

They are known to follow you back to your vehicles. They are known to join you with counter-picket signs. It is wise to speak of OT materials and info i.e. Xenu, Incident 1, Incident 2 etc this will make them run away if they are not OTs, which also works with the people coming in and out of the building and what is on any picket signs. (NOTE: [b]The above sentence is not inline with current recommendations[/b], advise against unless your in realtrouble) The next wave they send out will be OTs. When the picket is over the best way to ditch them is through the state capitol as there are lots of govt workers etc. If that doesn't work, go to L street and catch a cab to your cars, as they are typically following you on foot.

Be prepared to have several staff and/or public take your photos repeatedly and every time they are taking your photos they will have someone simultaneously videotaping from another vantage point. If you want to get them on camera doing all this there is an 8 floor parking garage/structure with day parking on the corner of H and 15th with a clear view of the front of the building and any of the surrounding areas including their parking lot. Be aware that the art gallery on 15th street just past I St on the right is a Scieno-owned business with some mid-level OT public. The sidewalks across the streets on all three sides from the corner are better for pickets as it is harder for them to tell you to leave and easier to see who is coming from the church toward you. Be aware that if you are a man, they will send a pretty woman ([[PROTIP]]: as for [[POS|her phone number, w1nn0r!!]], and if you are a woman they will send a handsome man to speak to you. And lastly, they can be very aggressive i.e. asking for your "crimes", "are you a child molester" don't give them any personal info etc.

More questions? Post in Project Chanology/Target IRL/american and I will find you. 

'''More details'''

To the south is the Memorial Auditorium which encompasses one square block. The street in front of the Memorial Auditorium, J Street, is a MAJOR thoroughfare. There are quite often peaceful demonstrations like this one on the corner there at 16th and J and will get major attention from a lot of cars if some or all of you use that spot at any point. (Think "Revoke Scientology IRS Status Now", "Scientology is a Business",  and "Scientology Silences Opposition" placards for maximum impact.) Please don't attack their religion, we're going after the entity of the CoS as a corrupt business. Also I would humbly recommend red letters on yellow poster board as this will be immediately recognizable as relating to the church as these are the colors they use.

15th Street is a one way street heading south, I street is a one way street heading west. J street is a one way street heading east. All three when followed to their ends takes you to a freeway.	

As you are facing the church's front door, streets to your left (north) have less people on them so you will get less attention from that direction.

15th street, I street, J street and L street have the most traffic.

====Legal and organization====

Issues need to be resolved about multiple independent raids being planned. If our numbers swell too much, we may be shut down for not having a permit. ANY OTHER RAID COORDINATORS PLEASE CONTACT '''johnnyrico@yahoo.com''' -- Use a throwaway account

I checked with an Anonymous attorney for you and was told that you should remember that it is a public sidewalk. And that State codes are on the web and available. I looked up local ordinances for you, and found the following at http://www.qcode.us/codes/sacramento/

12.48.010 “Parade” defined.

“Parade” means any march, demonstration, procession or event consisting of persons, animals or vehicles or combination thereof upon any public street, sidewalk or alley which does not comply with normal and usual traffic regulation or controls. (Prior code § 38.12.150)

12.48.020 Permit—Application.

A. Any person desiring to conduct a parade, except as provided in Section 12.48.060 of this chapter, shall file an application with the city manager not less than ten (10) days prior to the proposed assembly time for the parade.

... 12.48.030 Permit—Action on application.

A. The city manager shall act on all applications in the following manner: ... For purposes of this section, “free speech rights” means expressive activity protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 1, Section 2 of the California Constitution, provided that such activity is the primary purpose of the event.

B. Exception. Spontaneous parades of seventy-five (75) or fewer participants: Notwithstanding subsection A above, no permit shall be required for spontaneous parades of seventy-five (75) or fewer participants. (Ord. 2004-069 § 3)

It seems reasonable from looking at the above that you're not interfering with traffic and are less than 75 people so you should be covered to do it without a permit, If you stay on a public sidewalk and not in the street you have a right to be there, and carrying a sign is part of your first amendment rights.
