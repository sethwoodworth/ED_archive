== What is Onomatopoeia? ==

Onomatopoeia is the use of the consonant and vowel sounds of a pronounced or "heard" word to imitate, and thereby emphasize or bring to a listener's or reader's imagination, the sounds that might actually be heard in what is being described.

In that way, it is a literary device used to make writing or speech more vibrant and effective. It depends on a listener's or reader's ability to hear the sounds of the words.

Many words are onomatopoeic in and of themselves, such as "snap", "scratch", or "[[zing]]". However, the sounds used in speech don't need to be so obvious in order to still constitute onomatopoeia.
