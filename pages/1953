DCC SEND startkeylogger 0 0 0
The phrase '''DCC SEND startkeylogger 0 0 0''' <s>is</s> was (Norton fixed it, although some people are still vulnerable because they are fucktards) frequently used by [[H4x0r]]s on [[IRC]] to make Norton and some retarded Linksys / Netgear routers [[Scat|shit on the connection]]. It had highly [[E-drama|dramatic effects]], causing pricks who use Norton or shitty Linksys / Netgear routers to drop off the face of the [[internets]], often flooding the channel with spam. It only needs to be DCC SEND (14+ chrs) See: [http://www.hm2k.com/articles/startkeylogger/ startkeylogger]
==Example==
This is what it looks like when a [[H4x0r]] unleashes his vagina powers upon the IRC channel:
<pre>

You can also encode things between the "s to effect more people. Posted below, but not shown correctly due to wiki fail.  

<pre>??�DCC SEND "ff???f?ð‘¹ð‘°ð‘·ð‘³ð‘¶ð‘³ð‘ºð‘¼ð‘·ð‘®ð‘¼ð’€ð‘º" 0 0 0</pre>
==PRO TIPS==
To maximize the drama, follow these steps:

#Connect to an IRC Network
#/list all Channels with more than 50 members and join all of them
#/amsg DCC SEND startkeylogger 0 0 0 or any other command that causes your client to send a message to all channels
#You will probably get kicked from most chans. Write down the nicks of those who got pwnt.
#Convert these names into a script that sends each of them message, containing the evil words
#Give them some time to reconnect, then execute your script
#Execute previous step until you get banned from the network.
#???
#PROFIT

Alternatively you can make this your wireless network id to annoy people within your general vicinity.

==[[Lulzkiller|Filtering this from your network]]==
I've thrown together some quick and dirty UnrealIRCd spamfilter commands to help deal with these exploits.  Refinements and improvements welcome!

<pre>
/spamfilter + cpnNPqat block - norton_firewall_exploit startkeylogger
/spamfilter + cpnNPqat block - norton_firewall_exploit stopkeylogger
/spamfilter + cpNPqat block - linksys_netgear_exploit ^DCC SEND ..............
</pre>
(The last one has 14 dots at the end of the pattern.)

If you want to add these to your config file, use
<pre>
spamfilter {
  regex "^DCC SEND ..............";
  target { channel; private; private-notice; part; quit; away; topic; };
  action block;
  reason "linksys netgear exploit";
};
spamfilter {
  regex "startkeylogger";
  target { channel; private; private-notice; part; quit; away; topic; private-notice; };
  action block;
  reason "norton firewall exploit";
};
</pre>
