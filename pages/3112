'''Fuck My Life''' is a site that claims to be a "[[Bullshit|recollection of everyday anecdotes]]" that users share with the [[internet]]. Despite this claim, the site is really no more than an epic source of [[lulz]] and more epic pranks that can be pulled on your unsuspecting [[Victim complex|victims]]. It has also been postulated that the site is a [[Lie|sham...]] that most of the posts there are made up stories to give the site a more outrageous reputation. This remains to be seen, but there are some very [[Adobe® Photoshop®|obvious]] '''''"[[This looks shopped|pixels that stick out like they have been shopped]]"''''' on that site. [[Wikipedia|The authors of this article invite the reader to make their own judgments as to the validity of this claim.]]

==Origin of FML==
Fuck my life is an [[attention whore|attention whoring]] technique which was first Shat out into the world [[Shit no one cares about|as a line in the 2007 film ''Superbad'']]. Despite being a piece of shit movie, the line was reborn as a site for whiny bitches to attempt initiating some [[lulz]] from pointing out the embarrassing and shitty details of their day to day lives. Sometimes, though, these people are [[PeppermintPatti|in search of sympathy instead of lulz]]; a classic mistake. 

Example of [[attention whore|attention whoring]]:
"So sad right now guys :[ FML"

Desired reaction: "omg whats wrong?!"

Actual reaction: [[lulz]]

The difference between these [[butthurt]] posters and the [[oxymoron|regular site posters]] is they post [[Shit no one cares about|cries for help]] on [[failbook]]. You can help by trolling the shit out of these people.

==Posting on Fuck My Life==
[[You|Posters]] of the site are  usually [[emos]], [[Basement_dweller|basement-dwellers]] and [[16_year_old_girls|16 year old girls]] who think their lives are [[Butthurt|sooooo hard]] and that [[Anonymous|people on the internet]] [[lie|understand]] them. These can all range from [[NEDM|your cat being caught on fire]] to [[Shit no one cares about|your boyfriend cheating on you]]. Not many people know this, but 99.99% of FML posters are middle class, suburban, white kids who have everything they want in life; and are not starving in Africa.

But that is only half the fun...

[[You|Visitors]] to the site are encouraged to actively participate in the [[lulz]].  You do not have to sign up to make a FML post, but it is encouraged. Next, make sure to tell them that you are a [[girl]](so all the [[basement dwellers|visitors]] can pay attention to [[trap|you]], amirite?). Then, select a category under which your post can be classified ([[rape|Love]], [[drugs|Health]], and [[Sex|What you're never going to have.]] Unfortunately [[no one cares]] is not a category as all of them would be under it.The format has very few rules, just start the post off with TODAY, write your post, and then end it with FML. There is no subject that is [[Taboo|taboo]]. If you are the type that finds it interesting to post about how your father raped you when you were [[Children|seven]], you are more than welcome to [[No_one_likes_you|add your stories to Fuck My Life]].

==Examples of Lulz==
Because this article would not be half as funny as it should be without quotes from Fuck My Life, here is a brief list of them:
*Today, I decided to send my [[boyfriend]] a pic text of me [[naked]]. I accidentally sent it to my [[dad]] and got a text back saying "You definitely take after [[your mom]]". FML
*Today, I was eating ice cream and I noticed some on my jeans so I wiped it off with my finger and licked it. It was bird shit. FML
*Today, my girlfriend gave me a blow-up doll and told me to practice. FML
*Today, I heard a man [[Masturbating|pleasuring himself]] in the stall next to me during my post lunch deuce. I was washing my hands when my boss walked out of the stall. I can no longer look at him in the face. FML
*Today, it was the first time I ever saw a [[vagina]] in person. It was during [[User:Bryce|medical school]] training on how to do a pelvic exam. FML
*Today, I was at the strip club. I put my [[dollar]] on the stage. When the [[stripper]] came over to take it, she stood me up and flipped my tits and said I had bigger ones than her. I'm a guy. FML
*Today, I went on a first date with an [[Egyptian]]/[[Cuban]] sorority girl. I asked her what language she was brought up speaking. She said that her mom spoke to her in Spanish, but that she only ever replied in English. I said, "Oh, kinda like [[Star Wars|Chewbacca and Han Solo]]?" FML
*Today, my boyfriend told me he'd help me shave my mustache. I'm a female. FML
*Today, I woke up feeling like something was crawling inside my ear. I immediately went to the doctor's, and was told a roach had crawled into my ear. The doctor tried to drown it with water, but that only caused it to swell up and get stuck. I just had a roach removed piece by piece from my ear. FML
*Today, while in the hot tub with my friends, my gum fell out of my mouth and I had no idea where it went. Later that night I realized it had fallen down my swimsuit and had become adhered to my pubic hairs which then stuck to my underwear. FML
*Today, I had [[drunk]] sex with a girl that I barely know. I didn't have a [[condom]] and was nervous about getting her pregnant, but she assured me that I could pull out. Right when I was about to pull out, she wrapped her legs around me and yelled : "[[Pregnancy|BE MY BABY'S DADDY]]!" I couldn't get out in time. FML
*Today, I got out of bed and looked up only to see my penis. FML
*[[Chris Crocker| Today, I saw people making fun of Britney Spear's performance on Idon'tgiveafuck music awards.]]

==Recent Faggotry on FML==
Recently, people have taken to posting [[Fail|"counter-FMLs"]], where they pretend to be the [[lolwut|person another person interacted with.]]

Example:
:Original: "Today, I was in the park and saw a couple in mine and my boyfriend's special spot. I called him. The man in our spot's phone rang. FML."
:Counter: "Today, I was in the special spot in the park when my phone rang. It was my other girlfriend. FML." 

As you can see this is [[annoying]] as fuck, and [[unfunny]] as hell. This has little to no point other than to [[troll|irritate other people.]]

[[Srs bsns|Destroy them as soon as they are spotted, for they are the harbringers of]] [[anti-lulz]].

==Further Discourse==
<font face=Courier New>
'''«12:43:42» Aaron:''' Today, I submitted a story about how much my life sucks to Fuck My Life. They didn't put it in. I cried myself to sleep after listening to My Chemical Romance three hours straight.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life is so fucked that even Fuck My Life won't take pity. FML

After visiting the site and also reading the examples provided, the [[obvious|honesty of the site has to be questioned]]. Sure, the internet is [[anonymous|full of people]] who will literally stand in line to [[hypocrite|complain about something]], and you will more often than not, sit there and [[bullshit|listen to them.]] [[Idiot|But just how often does a person get online and complain that they ate bird shit, or that one of their 3rd grade school children attempted to grab their boobs three times in one recess?]] [[Shit|Far too many of the sites anecdotes]] have a [[pretentious|contrived sense]] to them, [[hypocrite|almost as if the site were pushing its own limits in an attempt to generate a larger internet footprint.]]
