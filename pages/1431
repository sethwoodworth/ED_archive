Apperantly, I'm supposed to believe [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]] and some other black persons conspired to take down Chappelle.

==The Site==
The information is presented very well, but then again, you can polish a turd all you want, but it's still a turd.

The site still hasn't updated when Dave returned, maybe he realised his information is bullshit, or no one would believe him anymore?

Or maybe the Dark Crusaders got him? ZOMG!

==Topical Lyrics==
I'm just an average guy with an average life

I work from nive to five, hey hell I pay the price

But I want is to be left alone in my average home

But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone

I always feel that somebody's watchin' me

And I have no privacy

I always feel that somebody's watchin' me

Is it just a dream?

When I come home at night

I bolt the door real tight

People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid

Well, can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid

When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair

I might open my eyes and find someone standing there

People say I'm crazy, just a little touched

But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much

That's why...

I always feel like somebody's watching me

Who's playing tricks on me

I always feel like somebody's watching me

Tell me it can't be

I don't know anymore

Are the neighbors watching me

Well is the mailman watching me

And I don't feel safe anymore, oh what a mess

I wonder who's watching me now?

Who?

The IRS?

I always feel like somebody's watching me

Who's playing tricks on me

I always feel like somebody's watching me

I can't enjoy my tea!
