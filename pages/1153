[[last Thursday|Once upon a time]], a [[user:kakama5|fuckwit]] who thinks that [[Anonymous]] is [[Anonymous Borg|The Borg]] decided to drop into #4chan [[IRC]] and tell [[moot]] that henceforth, all *[[chan]] related IRC faggotry was to be hosted on one [[anus|glorious umbrella network]] with the [[gay|genius]] name of [[lulznet]]. Said retard then [[rape|informed moot that this wasn't actually a suggestion]], it was decided and that resistance was futile. After moot said [[kthxbye]] to this imbecile and [[gline]]d him, he returned to tell moot that [[4chan]]'s site would be [[DDoS]]ed until moot complied.

But '''moot''' was hungry this day, my friends, and as much as he tried to give a shit about the impending [[The Caturday Nap|ruin]] of his site by moronic [[script kiddies]] and [[shit nobody cares about|the related shitstorm]] that would send ripples of [[Internet Hate Machine|hate]] throughout the Internets, moot had only one thing on his mind: [[Foetus soup|DELICIOUS SOUP]]! 

Moot then told the butthurt [[i|/i/nsurgent]]: "'''brb, soup'''" and off he went to [[Mootxico]] for tortillas, beans and [[cheese|jack cheese]], for [[Foetus soup|Tortilla Soup]] is the only soup that moot will eat. And so, the [[ruin]] of 4chan was on.

After a long, lost weekend in Mootxico, a soup-filled moot awoke in a pool of his own soup and vowed to [[chemo|"'''nevar again!'''"]] run off on a soup binge (at least while [[4chan|his kingdom]] was being [[buttsecks|plundered and r√¶ped]] by [[Talib&|ass pirates]]).

Ergo, 4chan lives on to fight the [[fail|good fight]] again my friends...and a soup is now a [[meme]]. The moral: if you [[bitches don't know|don't know]] [[not your personal army|shit about anonymous]], then for god's sake, don't troll a *chan admin.  For further morality; nutritional details are printed on the back of the can.

'''[[The End]]'''...[[Yes|or is it?!]]

:<i>In the following [[lulz|"morality play"]], the part of [[unwarranted self-importance]] is played by [[User:Kakama5|Locutus_of_Lulz]] and the [[soup|Soup Nazi]] is played by [[moot]].</i>
<div style="color: black; background-color: white; width: 575px; border: thin black solid; padding: .5em;">
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> We are Locutus of Anonymous
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> You will respond to our questions.
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> Your use of a public IRC netowrk is less efficient for Anonymous and to you.
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> We have established a large and stable network, just for Anonymous
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> Lulznet.
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> irc.lulz.net
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> aka irc.partyvan.org aka irc.lulzhost.net
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> It is the combined servers of many chans.
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> 7chan has joined, fapchan as well; 420chan will when they update their server software.
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> the /i/nsurgents built it off our several servers.
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> The Patriotic Nigras have added their servers.
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> Great things are afoot.
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> We will await your return
:<Locutus_of_Lulz> But we know that moving #4chan onto the central node is most efficient for all parties.
:<moots> not happening
:<moots> irc is stupid
:<moots> go away

</div>
Later, during the DDoS:
<div style="color: black; background-color: white; width: 575px; border: thin black solid; padding: .5em;">
:<Locutus_of_Loli> We do not wish to hinder the progress of 4chan
:<Locutus_of_Loli> But we must sadly attack until /b/ conforms to the will of Anonymous.
:<Locutus_of_Loli> We shall double the dataforce.
:<moots> uh okay
:<moots> i am going to go make soup now
