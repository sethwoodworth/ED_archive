Meximoot
'''Meximoot''' was [[moot]]'s online alter-ego before [[Christopher Poole|"real moot"]] [[came]] into the picture. Meximoot studied Mexican in school and obtained a degree in Mexican studies. Meximoot was successful, could go whatever he wanted to go, and could escape media attention, while real moot [[NEET|can't land a job]], only appears in [[weeaboo]] [[convention]]s, and is exploited by [[Time Magazine|TIMES]]. Meximoot was responsible for 4chan's 2005 donation drive. After reaching the desired milestone, Meximoot took off with the cash and headed for Mexico (later renamed [[Mootxico]]). Meximoot was later tragically eaten by [[shark]]s &ndash; a death largely forgotten by the masses.

Meximoot doesn't exist as an alternative persona anymore, and this meme faded into the history of old /b/-faggotry.
