'''Wikitravel''' is an overlooked website which actually contains some hidden [[lulz]]. Despite being a [[wiki]], it is not part of the [[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedo Foundation]]'s [[ghey]] empire, and thus is independent from [[Jimbo]] and his [[faggotry]]. Set up sometime around 2003, this wiki provides advice for people wishing to [[tourist guy|travel]] around the world. However, no one who is not [[batshit crazy]] would rely on this wiki for actual advice. Would you risk your life traveling through [[Afghanistan]] for the sake of a bit of [[vandalism]]?

The [[typical]] Wikitravel user is a butch [[old|30-something]] [[lesbian]] school geography teacher who gets off on [[hawt]] [[secks]] and [[stoner|smoking ganja]] whilst camping out in tents in the wilderness with her [[Lesbian pedophilia|new-found friend]], which explains why so much of the content on Wikitravel is a load of [[retarded|incoherent]] [[crap]].

There is also a number of Wikitravel users called [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|admins]], who are actually [[basement dwellers]] and have no useful [[IRL]] skills. These [[fag]]s instantly revert any additions, no matter how true the edits may be, that they think [[butthurt|dishonor]] their [[Shit no one cares about|hometowns]] and the places they traveled. ([[WTF|wait]]...[[LOL WUT|how come they do this]] [[Truth|as there is basically nowhere they actually traveled out of their basements]]?)

==Hidden Lulz==
Examples of the unintentional [[lulz]] that occurs throughout Wikitravel:

{{quote|[[Women]] should [[DO NOT WANT|not]] wear [[whore|shorts or mini-skirts]], especially as they travel away from Lusaka. ('''Thighs, to Zambian men, are huge turn-ons.''') [[tits or GTFO|Low-cut tops]], however, while discouraged, [[typical|are not nearly as provocative]].|[http://wikitravel.org/en/Zambia#Respect The 'Respect' section from Wikitravel's Zambia article].|color=#7EC0EE}}

{{quote|[[Rape]] and sexual assault levels are [[truth|exceptionally high]] and '''[[Pool's Closed|care should be taken]] due to the high [[AIDS|HIV]] levels''' in Johannesburg. Females should avoid [[asking for it|walking alone]] at all [[Rape Clock|times]] and should try if possible to [[anonymous pussy|remain in large groups]].

[[Some argue|General advice]] is to try your best to look like a [[Happy Negro|local]] and avoid at all costs displaying any form of wealth, including ear rings as these have been [[Switch police on|ripped from unsuspecting tourists ears]].

If you are a [[butthurt|victim]] of crime, '''DO NOT TRY TO BE [[An hero|A HERO]]'''! [[Pwnt|Hand over what ever they ask for]] as goods and possessions can be replaced, [[Second Life|your life can not]].|[http://wikitravel.org/en/Johannesburg#Stay_safe The 'Stay safe' section from Wikitravel's Johannesburg, South Africa article].|color=#7EC0EE}}

Many continents other than [[Africa]] feature lulzworthy locations, but the African ones are the most [[obvious]].

{{quote|The [[azn|Asian]]-made [[condom]]s onsale everywhere - such as the [[Japanese]] brand Okamoto - are [[lulz|too small for most Western men]]. Your [[whore|bargirl]] will often refuse to have sex with you if the [[big dick|condom doesn't fit right]]; and if she doesn't refuse, you are in [[AIDS|danger]]. |[http://wikitravel.org/en/Phnom_Penh#Stay_safe Stay safe in Pnom Penh, Cambodia!]|color=#7EC0EE}}

==Travel Topics==
Wikitravel has a list of [http://wikitravel.org/en/Travel_topics travel topics], in addition to the [[over 9000]] articles it has about places, some of which are hideously incomplete. You would have to be extremely [[gullible]] to trust Wikitravel on anything that is even remotely [[serious business|important]].

The site also has sex and drug tourism policies, so that [[pedo]]s do not know where to find those [[loli|little girls]] in the [[Philippines]], and it doesn't tell you where to die of a [[cocaine]] overdose.

==Famous Contributors==

[[Willy on Wheels]] has [http://wikitravel.org/en/Special:Contributions/Willy_on_Wheels! been known] to [[vandalism|vandalize]] Wikitravel. As for everyone else, [[nobody gives a fuck]] about them. This is because they edit under their [[real name]] and are thus unlikely to cause any [[lulz]] for fear of being [[gay|outed]].
