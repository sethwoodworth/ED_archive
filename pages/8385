This is the second notice that the factory warranty on your vehicle is expiring
[[Image:Telephone-rotary.jpg|thumb]]

This "'''second notice'''" is more like a tenth or twentieth notice, and will be repeated ''ad infinitum'' until you smash your phone into a jumbled mess of plastic and circuitry.

Like many [[Americans]], you may have a [[txt|cell phone]] for [[phone sex|vital communication needs]] and [[porn|wireless internet browsing]]. You may have recently noticed a rash of calls from [[robot|someone]] who appears to be quite concerned that the factory warranty on your vehicle is expiring, even though no one ever gave you a first notice of such, when you ride a bike or take the bus and don't even own a car, or are [[13-year-old boy|too young to drive]]. None of that matters. '''The factory warranty on your vehicle is expiring!'''

Of course this is a form of harassment and as such deserves harassment in return, which is precisely what happens on occasion when some poor [[/b/tard]] has had enough and [[rage]]s at [[4chan]]'s most popular board. Intrepid anons have somehow located the source of these irritating calls and dealt with it in the way in which anon excels: repeated childish prank calls. On occasion /b/'s telephone campaign lasts for hours, asking these selfless providers of fraudulent auto insurance if they cover flux capacitors or if they happen to carry ''[[Battletoads]]'' in their particular retail location.

As expected, the company from which these calls are originating completely denies calling thousands of people a day and then hanging up on them. That's right, once you reach a human operator and request to be added to their do-not-call list, they promptly hang up on you and call you back later that day. That is why the only way to properly combat these [[telemarketers|shitstains]] is to be an absolutely vulgar asshole to them. Upon reaching an operator it is advised that you:

* Repeat the word "penis" in an overly excited voice.
* Threaten them with violence.
* Threaten them with a class-action lawsuit.
* Threaten them with rape.
* Threaten them with [[Cannibal Corpse|knife rape]].
* Inform them that you very well may have fucked their mother.
* Scream yourself hoarse.

After enough of this abusive behavior, they'll soon remove your number from their various lists. If not, continue treating them like shit, black person.

[[Image:Secondnotice.jpg|thumb|left|Anonymous gets involved]]
Due to the massive amounts of [[rage]] these unwanted calls have caused, the internet itself decided to strike back, with [http://reddit.com Reddit] users [http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/8i1u7/want_the_phone_number_to_the_your_cars_warranty/ doing their homework] and digging up telephone numbers and addresses and organizing a massive [[raid|strike]] against '''Auto One Warranty Specialists Inc.''', owned by one '''David Tabb''' of [[California]]. Users [[hack]]ed their way into the voicemail systems, filled their inboxes with [[Rickroll]]s, and generally returned the company the favor that they've done for millions of Americans over the past few months. Meanwhile, the FTC has [http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/41859 targeted] companies involved in harassing [[you]], [[User:Killhamster|me]], and everyone else with a phone. Occasionally the ranks of [[anonymous]] manage to get something right, and this is one of those situations.

==[[Rick Roll|This is the second never gonna give you up!]]==
Two acts of trolling in one: fed up with hearing these incessant calls a few inventive souls have started calling the company and leaving a special message. Auto One Warranty Specialists Inc got Rick Roll'd.
