Voice Acting Alliance
{{achtung|EVERYONE ON THIS SITE IS A FAGGOT.}}
[[Image:Antfish VAA Face.jpg|thumb|The average VAA user in all his glory.]]

'''The Voice Acting Alliance''' (or [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/index.php VAA] for short) is a website that harbors primarily [[wapanese|culturally devoid teenagers]] that spend all of their time "voice-acting" (dubbing the latest episode of ''[[Ouran High School Host Club]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Bleach]]'', ''[[Lucky Star]]'', or any other [[animu|popular anime released in America]].)

Most users have either abandoned the website or are rabid, daily users whose lives are comprised of getting [[bullshit|constructive criticism on their vocal performances]].
In fact, the general populace that frequents this website are 20-year-old community college students that spend all of their time gossiping about other amateur voice-actors as pathetic as themselves. They forget that they've mostly abandoned their real lives in favor of a more ideal internet life in which they can mold their own self-image as they would like others to see them. Yet, they are the most [[internet tough guy|vicious, backstabbing nerds]] you'll meet in your life. The sole purpose of the VAA in recent years is not to teach people the art of voice-acting, but to be as two-faced and superficially nice to newbies as possible while loathing everyone that's been there for more than a week and hoping people focus on the public displays of 'kindness.'

{{quote|"Hiii I'm holding auditions for Bleach Episode 234 the episode where Ichiigo almost dies but doesn't and comes back even stronger just choose any line from the episode and send them to me at ilovepocky@yahoo.com and I promise I won't cancel it without telling anyone.|[[You|Everyone]]}}

As most know, [[internet drama|competition breeds rivalry]], and this is especially true on the VAA. The one thing that separates the VAA from real-world voice-acting is the fact that your life consists of dubbing episodes of anime that you and your friends voice because [[wapanese|you fantasize about being in the anime,]] whereas real-world voice-actors don't usually play the games or watch the anime they voice in because they're too busy making money and having respectable hobbies.

== Starting Up ==
The VAA is riddled with [[faggotry]] and if you wish to avoid it you'd be wise to follow several basic tips.

* Make a username that has no capitalized characters.
* In addition, make your username a blatant Japanese/anime reference (i.e. Shinigami or Ichigo).
* Create a demo reel after several days using only audition lines for characters you didn't get.
* In said demo reel, use a variety of horribly inaccurate impressions.
* Begin a page using broken English asking for auditions and bump it a fuckload.
* Openly [[troll]] people in the General Chat (that's what it's for).
* Realize that [[truth|you will never be a legitimate voice-actor]].
* [[Self Injury|CUTCUTCUT]]

And so on. In order to get the best results from your first experience it is ESSENTIAL that you lack basic communication skills, as those who do are plentiful on the boards and most often thrive.

== Auditioning ==
The largest component on the VAA are "productions", which consist of [[you|some douchebag]] starting up a dub or "abridged series" (there are [[at least 100]] of each abridged series on YouTube, most of them complete fucking garbage) that you can audition for, and here are some tips for snagging that oh-so-desirable lead role.

# Buy a microphone from Best Buy.
# Don't try and sound realistic - just overmodulate the mic.
# Audition for EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER even if your range is complete shit.
# If your pitch isn't good enough, modify the pitch to show your skills.
# Get the part.
# If you don't, [[suicide|you know what to do]].

Remember, if you don't end up getting a role you like, be sure to [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/showthread.php?t=40780&highlight=Watchmen+Motion+Comic&page=8 bitch and moan] to ensure your future casting in roles for which you audition.
Be sure to audition for "full series" dubs. [[lie|They're always seen through to the end 100% of the time.]]

== Critique ==
A critique request is another way of saying [[attention whore|"Hey, I want to be complimented."]] Most of the time people are too afraid to be honest with people and end up filling them with false hope, leading them to have an inflated [[e-go|Internet ego]].
In order to get the maximum quality critique response, use your ''Rock Band'' microphone.

== Demo Reels ==
A demo reel in the professional realm is meant to [[Shit nobody cares about|showcase one's vocal strengths, such as the ability to convey emotion, maintain stability during loud yells, as well as discern the voice-actor's attention to mic quality/management.]]

A demo reel on the voice-acting alliance needs to be all of these things.
* Lengthy and uninteresting
* Low-quality
* Unprofessional
* [[Final Fantasy|''Final Fantasy Dissidia'']]

On the VAA, [[truth|there is no such thing as professionalism]].

== The Harsh Truth ==
The VAA was made with the intention of [[orgy|bringing people together]] to get projects done, make social links and improve one's [[deepthroat|vocal abilities]]. There are several problems with that.

* [[Wapanese|Weeaboos]] make up the vast majority of the boards.
* [[Wapanese|Weeaboos]] have [[Poor|no money]] because they live with their parents.
* You can't buy nice microphones if you have [[Poor|no money.]]

== People ==
The people you'll come in contact with are all fucking retarded. They consist of:

* [[Furries]]
* [[Wapanese]]
* [[n00bs]]
* [[Unwarranted Self Importance|Know-it-alls]]
* [[Mary Sue|Moe Girls]]
* [[Unwarranted Self Importance|Moderators]]
* [[Internet Celebrities]] - They're too cool for the VAA.

== Notable People a.k.a. [[Truth|EVERY FUCKING NOBODY ON THE BOARD]] ==
Since the VAA is such a collaboration of talented individuals, let's talk about all of the most special ones in detail. ''Arranged in no particular order.''

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=4 TamTu] - Known by many as [[lie|the guy who created the VAA]] but more precisely known as the [[Unwarranted Self Importance|douchebag]] [[Azn]] kid who made his former girlfriend a [[mod]]. This just goes to show you that [[blowjob|working hard]] can get you anywhere in life. Also he lives in the [[LOL|Netherlands]], where all the great voice-acting occurs.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=5 Nikki Wright] - Aforementioned whore. Sucks yellow penises and closes threads with the utmost haste.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=116 Lucien] - An admittedly nice guy that unfortunately looks like a serial rapist AND pedophile at the same time. Has done real voice-work thereby qualifying him to reign over the VAA with an iron internet fist.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=7 Erica] - A woman that nobody knows anything about except for the fact that she and Lucien are dating. Rumored to be a big bitch, which is supported by her statement 'I'm really mean online, but I'm nice in person.'

How does one become a prestegious moderator on this clearly selective board? It's simple. Become [[RAPE|romantically involved]] with a moderator, a mod's friend, or the mod's [[MILF|mother]]. Instant stardom!

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=10037 TheNationMaker] - Attention-seeking kid that became [[internet celebrity|well-known]] on the VAA (ONLY) by making a series of shitty animu-generated avatars, called "The Quilt of Voices", ([http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/showthread.php?t=42805&highlight=Quilt+Voices 1] and [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/showthread.php?t=47460 2]) all of which were unoriginal and created for the sole purpose of gaining him connections through flattery. '''NOTE:''' This is not speculation; he actually admitted this to a very reliable source. Notice the implied obligation to thank him despite how stupid/uncreative most of the avatars are.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=1416 Corey Maddox] - [http://www.wsbtv.com/news/17965897/detail.html Convicted] [[pedophile]] and con-artist (now called [http://www.newvoice-productions.co.cc Dakota Smith])

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=5916 Mippa] - A 26-year-old [[slut|redhead]] that has all of the skills necessary to get into professional voice-acting [[rofl|yet still chooses to hang around on the Internet with animu faggots]].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?12243-Y.-Chang Y.Chang] - Yet another elitist dick from the board. Most of the time he is an obnoxious weeaboo who goes around strutting his dick along with his opinions in your face as if they are solid evidence. And anyone who disagrees will be eaten alive by his devoted fanboys and girls; who worship him and his very small dick. Oh and did I mention he's [[azn]]?

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=1896 Sapphire] - Representative black person of the boards. A mere glance into her "About Me" reveals that she's a hypercritical, judgmental, elitist asshole. Hangs out with her little sister (below) [[Asperger's|(because she's mega-popular)]] and views herself as [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|highly humorous/intelligent and a flawless troll]].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=1790 Zangya] - Does her best to troll when she is [[butthurt]]. Less intelligent and witty than her older sister but nonetheless makes the same bad jokes with a quarter of the efficiency. [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/showthread.php?t=50875 Has actually driven members away from the board due to her obnoxious and ebonic actions.]

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=80 Matt Cruea] - Probably the only non-faggot in all of the VAA that properly grasps [[trolling]]. Considering how experienced he is when it comes to verbally owning the fucktards he monitors, it makes you wonder why he's so [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Youatcomp.jpg active in the community].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=7525 Vincent The Paladin] - [[Lolicon|Don't leave him with your little sister.]]

* [http://www.youtube.com/user/dangavster Dangavster] - Partially skilled, obviously pompous. Refuses to work with anyone that isn't him. (To give perspective- he often uploads videos exclusively of himself voicing ALL of the males in an anime clip [[wat|BUT]] leaves in the official female voices, because he's [[Unrealistic Expectations|CLEARLY AS GOOD AS THE PROFESSIONALS]].) [[Narcissism|Most likely jacks off to recordings of himself.]]

* [http://www.youtube.com/user/antfishtas?blend=1&ob=4 Antfish] - The only negro on the Internet that hasn't insulted his own negroid culture. Has celebrity and voice-acting connections [[in the ass|up the ass]].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=2064 Zeix] - [[Fact|Probably a more conceited buttfuck than Semisoma01]] who loves to push and demand people around, [[Serious business|AS IF HE'S FUCKING IMPORTANT]]. He apparently has a raging boner for the PSP, because video games are the only thing he sucks the least at. He made this page and really only stops by to edit out unfunny things that butthurt individuals (including himself) post out of spite. 

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=11728 Kissy-Sensei] - [[serious business|The official voice of Aerith and Tifa in ''Final Fantasy VII'' dubs.]] A conceited slut that displays her sense of self-worth through head-up-her-ass actions. [[photoshop|Shoops the shit]] out of her pictures so she'll look really deep.

[[Image:Semisoma01 Ponytail.jpg|thumb|Oh bby, his gaze just makes me melt.]]

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=12587 Semisoma01] - Probably the definition of [[USI|conceit]], Semisoma is notorious for tooting his own horn constantly and proving to everyone around him that he can't be trusted. While everyone has accepted that Semisoma is an odd, confused young man with grandiose fantasies and an unwarranted sense of entitlement and self-worth, some people [[facepalm|actually defend him]] which just goes to show you that [[Chris-chan|everything has a fanbase]].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=9801 Kuro] [[Attention Whore|A hyperactive adolescent]] that will do ANYTHING to gain your attention. This includes changing her icon to provocative hentai screenshots, talking about her [[TITS|cup-size]] at any given time and releasing demo reels for the sole purpose of being loud or whorish. [[Stfu|Does not stop talking]] about [[Shotacon|little boys]].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=9534 Rahne] is a [[Fucktard|British wannabe]] who does nothing but worship members who are popular to gain his own self-recognition. If you are popular, [[Blowjob|he will worship you]] and continue to do so until either a) [[Fag|you cast him in a project]], or b) [[Winrar|tell him to fuck off like the little prick he is]]. Watch out for whenever he is in a thread, because he will get [[Butthurt|butthurt]] and [[Shit nobody cares about|rant your balls off]]. Did I also forget to mention he is [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and black person?

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=9396 Jackskellinghog] - A very confused [[Britfag|youth residing in Europe]] that doesn't know when he wants to be a kind-hearted [[Aspergers|carebear]] or a full-blown [[Aspergers|edgey troll]]. His favorite pasttime involves throwing his angry opinions about video games at people and then getting ridiculously worked-up if they remotely disagree. His claim to fame being that he pretended to be an emotionally jaded [[douche]] to everyone, resulting in his inevitable alienation by EVERYONE. Despite this, he still roams the forums, seeking voice-acting work that his horrible reputation ensures him he will never get. [[Doing_it_wrong|Has little grasp on what it means to troll.]] He also likes pretty pretty ponies.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=12695 Seymour] - Former-resident [[youtube|YouTuber]] and [[ROFL|celebrity]]. Despite having [[fact|no skill or talent]], he still thinks he is [[bullshit|good enough to be a professional voice actor]]. He tends to jump into trolling threads when [[Trolls|Kennidy, Sapphire, Y.Chang, Antfish or GeneralIvan do it]] for the sake of feeling like he is part of the [[bullshit|big-leagues]]. He also claims he has voiced nothing but [[Weeaboo|Blue-Haired Animu Protagonists]]. He also watches [[fact|Shoujo Animus]]. He also has a [[lol|chin beard]], and [[Stoner|looks like he is always on drugs]].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=11172 Koichi_Saito] is [[Yes|pretty much the definition of butthurt on the VAA]]. Whenever you make a joke or reference to [[Rape|rape]], [[Death|death]], [[Fucked|car accidents]], [[Guro|guro]], or [[Barack Obama|Hawaii]], he gets [[Facepalm|extraordinarily butthurt]] because of [[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya|God knows]] what. Not to mention, to compensate for his [[Homosexuality|assfuckery]], he is terrible at voice acting, with an accent that [[Bukkake|makes him sound like semen clouds his throat]].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=8053 NikkiWhora] is a gigantic [[Whore|whore]], who has [[Pretty cool guy|fucked every guy on the VAA]]. She loves to consider herself [[weeaboo|tsundere and moe]], when in reality, she's just a [[Fat|fat]] bitch who [[loser|plays Yu-Gi-Oh]]. Her daily post on the forum: [[Retard|"omg im goin 2 awedition for louise bcuz shez so loli im soooo loli 2"]] '''WARNING:''' [[Fuck|She won't shut up]]. On another note, she was also asked out by Instraclassic, who she dated for about a day, before dumping his ass after realizing that he was a pathetic fake-British fag who cried all the time about his uncle raping him. Kennidy is jealous because NikkiKora took her boyfriend's e-flowers. 

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=220 Cristina Vee] - [[Internet Celebrity]] for singing [[animu]] themes on [[youtube]]. When not having her ass kissed by [[Bitch|BlueSentaiHero]] and [[Pedophile|TheNationMaker]] (see above), she is actually doing [[Irony|professional work for terrible animu dubs]]. Her voice is [[Rina-chan|incredibly average]] but because she's the first ridiculously attractive weeaboo in existence [[Whore|she manages to land gigs regardless.]] It's also noteworthy that she pretends to be an absolutely adorable Mary-Sue and then counteracts her forced persona by posting [http://www.youtube.com/user/ValliereVee camwhore cosplay pictures] publicly.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=615 Haushinka/Rina-chan] - [[Rina-chan|Need I say more?]]

[[Image:VAADramaUsako.png|thumb|CRY MOAR]]

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=11424 Usako] - A black person [[Annoying|pervert]] whose profile consists of nothing but reminders on lines because she is [[Otaku|a fat lazy fuck who does nothing]] but [[Masturbation|masturbate]] to [[Faggot|Tuxedo Mask]]. Speaking of which, she's like [[Grandma|56-years-old]] and she still likes [[Sailor Moon|Sailor Moon]] despite her [[Bullshit|"mature attitude"]]. A nickname she has garnered through the VAA is [[Fat|"Many Pounds"]].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=8791 Hnilmik] - A [[unwarranted self-importance|conceited know-it-all]] [[Azn]] [[bitch]] who thinks she is the greatest thing since sex.  Because she suffers from severe narcissistic personality disorder, she spends most of her time in the Voice Acting Chat forum bragging about how [[lie|SUPAR AMZING SHE BE at voice acting]].  Her special abilities include overacting, having a weird Asian speech impediment, and being named [[Tranny|Tran]].  She enjoys long walks on the beach, talking about herself, and denying the fact that she sounds like a 12 year old lesbian whenever she opens her mouth.  Will probably commit harakiri after realizing that real voice actors don't speak [[Engrish]].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=13257 InstraClassic] - A [[Poser|fake brittish]] [[Cigarette|fag]] who likes to think he's not a faggot. His only use is to take angled pictures of himself wearing cliche graphic-novel style shirts and sporting straightened hair that covers up his fugly cranial structure. His favorite method of [[doing it wrong|being funny]] is to spout memes incorrectly at the first moment of hesitation, regardless of the context. If you see anything unfunny in this article, it's because he or Kennidy edited it as such. Fact- he is a [[bipolar]] fuckwad.

[[Image:worm.jpg|thumb|Pictured: Kennidy.]]
* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=9142 Kennidy] - A [[bitch|girl]] who consistently complains that she is a "worm" and wants to [[do it faggot|kill herself]]. She is a huge fucking [[weeaboo]], like most others on the site. Kennidy believes she is [[weeaboo|tsundere and moe]]. She complains and bitches to her boyfriend, InstraClassic, that she only gets cast as [[loli|lolis]]. This is because these are the only voices that she does not absolutely suck at. She is incredibly jealous of everyone on the VAA who has a voice that has developed past that of a 6-year-old, and thus edits this article in an attempt to get back at everyone for having less screechy voices than hers. Shh, don't make fun of her. She and NikkiKora just broke up.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=12394 Kiramaru16]  Kiramaru is an asian clown that jacks off to poodles, he can not talk without slurring and he is a complete pervert despite having a girlfriend,  Kiramaru critiques hard on men despite sucking himself, all you have to do to get a good critique from Kiramaru is be female.  Also, Kiramaru sells corndogs to old people at night. 

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=19419 Merushi_Rey] Pathetic newbie to voice acting who claims to be in an 'Agency' and that she is a voice acting 'instructor'. In reality, she just attends JRP acting school, which is a big bucket of bucks with no real gain. NOTE: She auditions for things and adds no emotion and sounds completely bland. THINKS SHE IS A BIG SHOT.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=14565 Heroesrock09] A Johnny Yong Bosch wannabe douchebag that resides in England, and a queer. Really a definition of butthurt. He begs everyone to critique his auditions on YouTube. When someone tells him that he needs work (which he actually does due of his awful acting), he whines like a three-year-old baby-back bitch and acts like a fucking faggot who wishes to be bigger than everyone. But he is only just a 16-year-old boy with really small testicles that never has, nor will he ever, hit puberty in his life. Not to mention, he is really horrible at voice acting, and so does his shitty Johnny Yong Bosch imitation that he always does in ALL his auditions. When he does it, he sounds so constipated like he is trying really hard to push squall326x's (his YouTube sex buddy/lover) cock back out of his ass when his parents are about to barge in his room so they won't catch these two lovers fucking. Let's be surprised that he didn't suck squall326x's cock after that.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=11060 Cruc1f1x21]- The VAA's resident pedophile, assumed to have E-banged more than half of the Wannabe-Moe's and Tsundere's the second he joined the forum. Chances are when he's not secretly jacking off to your demo reel, he's in a call with one of the many girls that he plans to E-date over the span of a week, forcing them 3to commit some form of sexual act for him over cam, so he can masturbate screaming in his sugoi ne Edward Elric voice! It first started when [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=9667 SweetSourSauce] or Sh3rlock as she is liked to be called, was tricked into his evil scheme of taking a picture of her flatchested breasts for him. Since he's totally a sexual perv, his pervy instincts say take what you have and go for the n00ds.  His current internet obsession is [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=8591 ~xXLittleXGurlXx~], whos not much of a prize pig herself. Ask the right people and you will find out she's a lonely scene gurl who enjoys pleasuring herself to strangers over teh interwebz. SOU KAWAII NE!! Sssh, Cruc1f1x is still trying to get over the fact he can't find real gurl. He might just come after your next demo. 

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=13275 OmegaOptimusSupreme] An overweighted weeaboo who is highly conceited. This fat shit thinks he has GODLY range and claims to be the Christopher Sabat and Samuel L. Jackson of voice acting but he is REALLY horrible at hiding his voice. No matter what voices he does, we'll STILL know it's him doing the voice before even reading the cast list. He always sounds like he is getting fingered in his ass every time he gets behind the mic. It's most likely because he is riddled with faggotry (with the help of [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=17388 Haruhost], his homosexual friend, and future lover...yeah, lucky.) and is just PLAIN AWFUL at voice acting in general. Not to mention, he constantly [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEUElJcTwWc jacks off to Power Rangers] when he's not voice acting, OR wishes he could but he is having trouble finding his microscopic penis that always hides under his [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Fat ENORMOUS BELLY]. Go figure!

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=14764 xBlackTaintedHeartx] An Australian slut that spends most of her time getting fucked by crocodiles doggystyle for money and pleasure when she is not voice acting. No one even thinks that this hooker should be called a voice actress since a more suitable word for her "acting" is "sleeptalking". Her Rinoa voice sounds like a fucking whore with a horrible Australian accent reading her script from a paper with abysmally tiny letters. She is better off getting filled with crocodiles' cum, not too different from the following "sleeptalker" under this paragraph. She's also a worse sound mixer than a mute rock. In fact, a kitchen mixer is more suited to mix projects than this cock gargling bitch.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=13022 Aussieroth] A [[Retard|retarded]] Australian with [[Autism|Asperger's Syndrome]] who is very known for his [[Sarcasm|AMAZING]] "Darth Vaderised" Sephiroth voice. His mindset is being "original" whenever he auditions for a role, but this is only to cover up the fact that he can't really sound like anything else than a cock choking retard. He was, and still is, extremely [[Butthurt|butthurt]] when [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=12587 Semisoma01] turned him down in a Kingdom Hearts fandub when he decided to replace him with [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=11919 someone much better than this faggot]. Whatever you do, stay away from this [[Faggot|guy]], or else he won't [[STFU|stop talking about his dreams of being Sephiroth's official VA]]. He can shove his dreams of being Sephiroth's official VA in his ass as well as his long sword. And maybe he can make his own [[Hentai|hentai]] from that and then put it on the shelf for all the [[Faggot|faggots]] around the world. Hopefully it would make him enough money to move out of his father's dirty basement he lived in for 24 years. He also regularly fills up above mentioned aussie twat with his Darth Vader autistic cum, turning the inside of her tummy socially retarded, making her insides shy away from the crocodile mutant inside of her created from the mix of all the thousands of crocodiles she let rip her open as wide as a the long side of Grand Canyon (including above mentioned Assburger fuck).
* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=9667 Sh3rlock]- The VAA fake loli. Known for her super fake high voice but really she just covers up her old granny smoker voice. Complains about life all the time but really just bitches about it to bitch, making her a major attention whore. Dated and fucked almost every guy on the VAA, except for InstraClassic, because she doesn't have time for fake british bipolar fuckwads. She does the peace sign in almost all of her pictures which makes her so [[attention whore|kawaii desu]]!!! She tries to keep drama alive and tries to turn people's friends against them. Gets butthurt of the stupidest of things. Wants to become an hero over interweb drama.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=12125 Rixxen] - A hole of an ass who faps to the thought of people crying. When not failing (or fapping) he is usually making out with his nasty little feet. And if you met him in person you'd SWEAR that he eats his own shit.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=14234 Gonax] Pokemon furfag, who faps to it all the time. In fact, he has been caught fapping to hentai by a black person guy at his school (click [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHfUkyDepTQ here] to watch the video). Not only is he known as the [[Asian]] who makes grammatically incorrect posts, but he has no idea what the fuck he's doing. Has said various times that his brother rapes him up the ass while he sleeps. He's also bffls with [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=9667 Sh3rlock] and [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=12125 Rixxen] and no matter how old the drama is they always talk about it. Only hangs out with lesbians, bisexuals, and homosexuals just to cover up his own faggotry.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=12354 One-Winged-Chaos] - An asshole by any other name.  This thing resides in the deep south; his hobbies include fucking dogs/cousins/cousin-dogs and flailing about in front of a microphone like a horny harlequin.  He's earned one of the most undeserved reputations of the VAA for his "craezee voises," when actually he's just trying to cover up his morbidly southern accent.  Hyperknees91 has foolishly attempted to awaken the "Sleeping Giant" that is One-Winged-Chaos' "normal" voices, only to have him sound like an overly-tense cousin fucker whose clothes are presumably embroidered with crusted semen; the result of a long, lonely, pathetic life.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=11915 BossTrigger] - A faggot that will never pull Steve Blum's cock out his ass, and a shitty actor that nobody gives a fuck about. Believe it or not, he is secretly bisexual. His hobbies include rubbing his own nipples to Steve Blum at an anime convention when he's horny and masturbating to [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=12997 BlackSilkNinja's] pictures because she refuses to give him some ass, hoping to get everyone to stop calling him a fucking queer. This retard has no idea that she's contracted herpes from a lot of guys she secretly sucked off. Let's hope BossTrigger doesn't catch herpes from her soon, or else his life would be FUCKED and then he'll kill himself by choking on a dildo that he always uses to stick in his ass every time he dreams about getting fucked hardcore by Steve Blum! 

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=18935 Labamba] is a [[retard|retarded 20-year-old]] who doesn't like anyone telling her [[Trying_too_hard|SHE CAN'T VOICE ACT]] and will spam the inboxes of her offenders with [[drama_queen|woes me stories]] laced with profanity in the hopes of making not only herself feel better, but making the recipient feel guilty enough to simply give her the role she auditioned for.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=10451 ShiroKaisen] - This little piece of [[Crap|brown gold]] has a knack for voicing wimpy and whiny characters, who much like himself, bitch and complain behind the backs of those who he felt wronged him in order to gain the sympathies of others. [[Homosexuality|He does not subscribe to a heterosexual narrative]] and deludes himself into believing that his hard-on is for [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=10585 MissAck]. He desperately clings to his role as the main character in a fan dub of [[Yu-Gi-Oh|you-gay-ho]] starring with [[Littlekuriboh|this middle-age weeaboo]], while inventing new and convenient ways of getting [[butthurt]]. This entry is one of them.

* [http://www.youtube.com/user/no1japanesefan no1japanesefan] - The author of most of the shittier written entries found on the VAA ED page. Devoid of any originality, no1japanesefan/lonelytony/babydoofus spends most of his time trying to hurt others' feelings with the vocabulary of a child who just discovered cursing.  Although not a member of the VAA (to anyone's knowledge) he has taken up editing this ED page quite frequently lately, seeing as the original creators abandoned editorial duties a few months ago.  He feels he is the most effective hate-machine since Facism but the annoyance many find with him is not his attacks or self-entitled rudeness.  It is that he takes the lulz out of trolling and replaces it with sighs.  He is an enemy of what the internet truly stands for: unrelenting, purposeful hatred.  Fuck fuck fuck.

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=5106 Flamzeron] - A particularly irritating [[manchild]] and insufferable [[Wapanese|weeaboo]] who has infested a number of boards dedicated to Scamco's "Tales" [[animu]] RPG series. This member is particularly noteworthy as he frequently takes his passion for [[never|someday]] being a professional voice actor to other boards, offering to audition for officially licensed dubs that are currently in production. He is always ignored. Trying to tell him the [[truth]] about the shit quality of his voice acting will result in a [[PMS|bitchy]] tirade about how he's "improved." He has an incredible hard-on for [[animu]] voice actor [[fag|Brian Beacock]], and is the only person in the world to believe him to be a suitable replacement for the guy who voiced Robin in [[Teen Titans]].

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=15476 Zekkai] - Stop. Do you really think you're funny?

* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=16706 Zer0] -Fresh new VAA member, (or not rather, since he owned a multitude of [[faggot|ignored accounts before-hand]]), who walked in immediately with a stick jammed up his ass, he spouts on and on about how [[lies|professional]] he is, and why you should listen to everything he says, and claims he knows people in the professional business, he also gets very [[extremely butthurt|upset]] when more then 3 people start a valid and reasonable argument with him, which could bring up where he's been [[Youtube|last]], [[fact|it's seems that he lives a comfy little fucking life where he can pay someone to suck his dick or stroke his inflated ego.]]

* [www.youtube.com/user/no1japanesefan]- no1japanesefan - A homoerotic literature author who when he's not masturbating his microscopular penis with tweezers to underage boys he dreams of filming and molesting, he tries to troll talented Voice Actors on youtube to compensate for his lack of any penis. He lieks to think he is clever, when, in fact, none of his opinions or points make any actual sense, or, I shit you not, not one, ONE, qualify as a legitimate reason, therefore, he is fucking batshit retarded.
Meaning he gives real trolls a bad name, which is a compliment for people like him. He claims that Japanese actors are superiror to English Voice Actors because Jpn r kl. 
He then, after getting pwned by said Voice Actors,﻿ scurries off to his mom's basement to write and fantasize about them. He is currently near to publishing his first 10000 page novel, "How much I want buttsecks from underage boys". He accuses everyone﻿ else of being a weebo when his name and all he can think about when he's not caught fapping relentlessly to male children is Japan. 
He is actually the Voice Actors he troll's personal punchbag, and he doesn't even notice. He has 0 subscribers and believe it or not he actually had a single youtube friend, who added him for the lulz, then shortly removed him after he realised what a creepy motherfucker he was. 
He can't spell properly and most of his sentances make little sense, the only time his grammar is correct is one he is enjoying writing his homoerotic literature. Sadly he is yet to learn to write even his name correctly, as with "no1japanesefan" he meant to say no.1, when he wrote "NO ONE", which is what he is, a pathetic little boy without﻿ a life or single talent to speak of, he is also, awestrikingly fucking stupid. What he intended to do was write "number 1 japanese fan", which means he is still a weeboo, therefore, either way, he still FAILS AT LIFE.
Either way, he's still a whiny, retarded, pathetic little failure of even a troll who likes stalking 16 year olds on youtube and writing stuff about them. To which pretty much the whole of VAA PWNs him, which he was rejected from long ago for having no talent. At all. 
* [http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/member.php?u=9149 Sonicmega] - An all-around Nintendo [[fag|fanboy]], Sonicmega has been the mascot of all that is awkward and average about the VAA. His most recognizable trait being the ability to sound constipated when he takes on the role of [[moralfag|protagonist.]] He attended AX Idol 2009 and made it into the finals using a very sub-par Death Note reference (as seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUQpkyfVYog here]) and quickly wore out his welcome by never [[lol|shutting the fuck up]] about his confusing victory. If you add him on Skype he will almost undoubtedly link you to [[Jewtube|YouTube]] videos involving his voice-acting or anything relating to Sonic or Megaman, [[Copypasta|show]] you his [[Gay|zany]] conversations with friends, or send you his [[Sarcasm|super interesting]] voiceover bloopers, all without ever asking if you [[NO|give a fuck]]. The only thing he ever talks about is all the voice-acting he does, or anything else involving exclusively him.
