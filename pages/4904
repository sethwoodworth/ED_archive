'''[http://www.liveleak.com/ LiveLeak]''' is a hybrid of [[YouTube]] and [[Wikileaks]] that is popular for videos found to be too [[hardcore]] for the likes of YouTube and [[Froggy|Dailymotion]]. Despite this, you won't find any [[pr0n]] on LiveLeak. Instead, what you will find is a ton of [[lulz]]y content related to [[IRL drama]] of various kinds such as [[violence]], [[crime]] and [[war]]. It's not a [[shock site]] but instead is often seen as a [[moralfag]] site where people try to promote their [[political]] views about whatever [[bullshit]] cause they believe in, being the [[Internet Vigilante Group|internet vigilantes]] that they are. However it's owned by the same company as the [[Ogrish]] shock site. If LiveLeak did have porn, it'd probably be "extreme pornography" to keep up with the violent theme, and the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] would probably be on their asses by now.

[[TOW]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveleak says] that even a New World Order [[cockpuppet|puppet]] like [[Tony Blair]] mentioned LiveLeak at a political conference. This just shows how the [[old media]] is dying and spawning a new generation of awareness of the chaos that is going on around us. The comments on LiveLeak, which are even less [[censorship|censored]] than those on YouTube, often show right-wing '[[newspeak|extremism]]', '[[racism]]' and '[[white nationalism]]' of the sort found on [[Stormfront]], but they are are also many people there involved in things like the Nation of [[Islam]] and [[al-Qaeda]] making [[lulz]]y comments as well.

If YouTube and Dailymotion are the [[mainstream]] (with the [[fish]]! [[unfunny|Get it]]?), then the similar sites to LiveLeak can be found on [[blogs]] like the [http://www.brusselsjournal.com/ Brussels Journal] and [http://littledoor.blogspot.com/ some chick] with a [[fetish]] for [[putin|Medvedev]], continuing the [[Russian]] theme, with [http://www.fdesouche.com/articles/33981 RuTube.Ru]'s video of a white [[French]] kid getting beaten up on a bus by two [[nigra]] males. He later apologised for his [[white guilt]], [[liberal guilt]] and [[political correctness]], forgiving his attackers because he is a [[pussy]].

The [[pr0n]] version of LiveLeak is [[efukt]], a shit site bearing a slight resemblance to [[jj.am]].

==Things that are too disturbing for LiveLeak==

Actually, [[disregard that]]! [http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c41_1241737170]

==Proof that LiveLeak videos are watched by [[sick fuck]]s==
[[Image:Suicidal girl train tracks.gif|thumb|[[An hero|Poor girl]].]]
Watch them gloat over the [[an hero]]ism of a poor girl from [[Argentina]] who decides to stand in front of an oncoming [[train]] with her arms outstretched like Jesus: [http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=de5_1243442739 Make sure you read the comments]

By and large, though, LiveLeak remains just like some crappy, cheap late night [[television]] programme like ''America's Dumbest Criminals'' or ''Police Camera Action'' featuring CCTV footage of criminals who later meet their [[for great justice|justice]] at the hands of the [[law]], all the while interspersed with people like [[Chris-chan]], the [[Dominos]] retards and people doing stupid things like killing themselves or destroying objects. It is therefore likely to be a favourite site of your average [[13-year-old boy]] as a result.
