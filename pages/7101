'''Rucas''' is the [[GNAA]]'s Vice President of Operations, and a [[developer]] of numerous [[GNAA]] [[Open Source]] projects.

Rucas first joined the GNAA in 2002, and shortly thereafter wrote one of the very first incarnations of [[GNAA]] [[Last Measure]], which he subsequently got posted multiple times on the front page of [[Fark]].  He has also written several other IRC flooding tools, including ASIAN (Automated Synchronous IRC Assault Network), and STUPID (SSH Tunnel Utilizing Python IRC Destroyer).  He also started the extremely-effective [[Firefox XPS IRC Attack]] against Freenode.

He has served two times as the [[GNAA]]'s president, once during 2004 when [[timecop]] [[ragequit|emoquit]], and once again during 2009, before the first presedential election in the newly-reformed organization.

Rucas is a [[USI|self-aggrandizing]] guitarist, [[Charles_Bukowski|novelist]], [[alcoholic]], and [[Rucas|known earthworm]].

Rucas is known to move quite frequently, and is thus reputed to be highly [[docs|undoxable]].
