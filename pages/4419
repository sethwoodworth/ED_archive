He currently runs Dramatica, Inc (parent company of Encyclopedia Dramatica) after purchasing the site in early 2005. He also does business in information security, investment management, category management and financial services.

In late February 2010, Joseph received threats from the Australian government. In March he returned from his vacation and promptly [http://www.blog.encyclopediadramatica.com/?p=84 published a scathing essay] in response to the Australian HRC. A veritable tornado of coverage ensued.

==Everspotting==
[[Image:Everszeta.jpg|thumb|right|One of the few pictures of Evers before the age of 30, Evers (left) is seen here in Las Vegas during Halloween.]]
After Lulzcon 2006 Evers took a trip to the [[Amazon]] to drink [[Jenkem|ayahuasca]] prepared by Amazonian shamans. After which he sent a frantic series of emails where he claimed to have "been given the gift" and to know "exactly what needs to be done".

Sometime afterwards, ED communicated with Joseph Evers through a disjointed series of Chirp messages, which culminated in the following ominous message: "im on a boat full of white snow." [http://twitter.com/JosephEvers] Nobody has seen or heard from him since then, but there have been reports of sightings in and around the Hispaniola [[spam]]mer bars.

On November 9, 2009, a big moment in ED history, Joseph Evers made his very first visit to #forum since its creation!  It was approximately one year since his previous visit to [[ED IRC]].  Things haven't changed much, as [[Zaiger]] wasn't a sysop then, and still isn't now! 

==Hobbies==
While spending time at his home in the Cayman Islands, Mr. Evers enjoys spending his time rock climbing, and hiking as well as spending time with friends and family. Evers also spends time studying scripture.
