Ignore All Rules
'''Ignore All Rules''' is an unusually [[lulz]]worthy statement which was made by [[Jimbo Wales]], king of the [[Wikipedophiles]], [[at least 100]] years ago.

A way of improving [[Wikipedia]] would be having an article on the [[Gay Nigger Association of America]] but [[Amy Whinehouse|no, no, no]], the [[Bureaucratic Fuck]]s would ''never'' have that (and still BAWWWWW about the fact that TOW finally has an [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] [[article]]). A way of maintaining Wikipedia would be reverting [[vandalism]], but only [[DerHexer|those]] who have [[no life]] actually do that.

In other words, it's completely hypocritical and [[logic|contradicts]] all other [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines]]. It basically means the admins have power to control the [[encyclopedia]] in any way they want, and [[Wikipedia:WP:DGAF|do not give a fuck]] about what [[you]] think should be done.
