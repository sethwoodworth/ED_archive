'''Self injury''' (SI) is a [[disorder]], a contagious [[disease]] and [[cult]] all wrapped up into one. It is generally inherited by, caught and followed (respectively) by [[emos]] as well as both the [[IRL]] and [[OTI]] [[attention whores]] of the developed world.  In other words David Peters is the typical cutting faggot.

It hurts on the inside, so [[you]] want to hurt on the outside. [[truth|That makes sense.]] 

Self injury can range from taking a lighter to one's nipples to compulsively pulling out hair or engaging in the exceedingly popular slice-and-dice (cutting). Advanced techniques include fucking oneself with a cactus or burning your own [[schlong]] in the middle of an elementary school yard.

== Cutting ==

[[Image:LolCutterGross.jpg|thumb|Cool kids take pictures of their [[Fail|sorrow]].]]

[[Image:Doingitwrong.jpg|thumb|Pussy.]]

[[Image:Daddy fucked me and i loved it.jpg|thumb|A way to show your everlasting love without expensive tattoos.]]

[[Image:Owchh.jpg|thumb|NOT attention seeking. HONEST.]]

One of the most popular and fashionable ways to self-injure. Mainly done by [[16 year old girls]] and [[emos]]. 16 year old girls cut, cut, cut the pain away because they are usually [[rich]], privileged, lucky, well-financed kiddies who just don't have anything serious left to bitch about (e.g. [[Africa|starvation]], [[Africa|genocide]], [[AIDS]]). [[Some argue]] that we should let them play [[Redtube Roulette|Russian roulette]] and see if any actually [[Suicide|kill themselves]], ridding the world of their [[butthurt]] whimpering once and for all. 

Remember kids, if you're going for [[suicide]], it's between and '''not''' across the bones. You also might want to consider using something sharper then your everyday dull butter-knife and less unwieldy than your everyday tiny razor blade. This method is often summarized with the [[catchphrase]] "down the road, not across the street."

Numb your arm and take some aspirin and [[alcohol]] to thin your [[blood]]. Remember: the quicker and more forceful, the deeper! If you don't do it right the first time, just keep drinking and digging in with that blade until you hit an artery and start splatterpainting the walls with blood, then go run a warm bath, turn on your favorite music and relax.

'''''[[Relevant to my interests|IMPORTANT NOTICE]]:''''' ''Cutting and self-injury in general are not new fads. [[13 year old|Middle school kids]] have done it for years because middle school kids are [[retarded]] and have severe [[Disorders|emotional problems]].''

But feel free to push them until they snap and become high school [[to the max|masochists]], or at the very least, [[true]] [[emos]].

=== Ways to Cut ===

* '''Regular''' - Knife in right hand, cut on left.
* '''Goofy''' - Knife in left hand, cut on right.
* '''Mongo foot''' – Cutting on the same side as you hold the knife.
** ''PROTIP:'' Maybe you should try your legs with this one.
* '''The Dissociative''' - Think about cutting, wake up in the morning with scars.
* '''The Wussy''' - Get a [[friend]] to cut you...[[No|if you have any]].

=== It's Not Working! ===
It is possible to [[fail]] at all forms of self-injury, but particularly easy to fail at cutting. Cutting can be done in a fashion that has no chance of accomplishing anything; in most cases carried out by the sizable percentage of [[emos]] who suffer from certain [[intellectual disabilities]]. While [[hardcore]] cutters find a way to cause actual harm even in the least ideal circumstances, emos somehow manage to fail even when the [[:Image:EmoChoices.jpg|tools]] are readily available. Cutting in this manner fails to get the desired [[attention]] but succeeds in generating [[lulz]] for everyone but the cutter. It usually involves blunt objects or anything else that would otherwise never cut a wrist. Examples of such items include:

* Spoons
* The wrong edge of a knife
* A butter knife
* The cutter's other wrist
* A [[Slipknot]] CD (possible if you try hard enough, but most [[emos]]' muscles have atrophied to the point that they can barely lift the CD)
* [[My Chemical Romance]] t-shirt
* Air - and you thought that those hardcore kids were waving their arms in the air for no reason!

== Reasons to Self-Injure ==
* [[Borderline Personality Disorder]], [[PTSD]] or damn near any other psychological [[disorder]] (including [[Inconsistent Personality Disorder]])
* Re-visiting [[Ohbutyouwillpet|childhood abuse]]
* Listening to the [[Jonas Brothers]].
* Preventing [[suicide]] and/or trying to convince [[LJ|"friends"]] that you're RLY [[SRS]] THIS THYME
* It's the only way I can feel.
* [[Unrealistic expectations|The girl I like doesn't like me back]]
* [[Basement dweller|My parents grounded me for a week even though I don't go out anyway]]
* [[Asperger's Syndrome|My favorite show on Nickelodeon got canceled]]
* [[Morrissey|I am the son and the heir of a shyness that is criminally vulgar]]
* [[Scientologist|...the voices told me to.]]
* [[RAGE|ANGRY!]]

''LJ Classics''
* [[LiveJournal]] is down so I can't post my [http://community.livejournal.com/anyotherworld/1575346.html deep thoughts] on {{ljcomm|_knowyoulive}} :-(

== Self Injury For Fun and Profit! ==
The considerate self-injurer will be aware of the lulz potential of his or her actions and thus will make as many hilariously emo posts as possible and use their own gory pictures as [[trolling]] tools. ('''''OMG TRIGGER!!!''''') Sadly, such selflessness is rare in today's [[black|degenerate]] world, with the [[drugs]] and the [[violence]] and that gosh darn [[rap]] music, with the hipping and the hopping.

It should be noted that most of those who appear considerate enough to keep the trolling community well-informed actually turn out to be whiny little emo pieces of crap with no [[Disorders|real problems]] that just want (and [[expect]]) everyone to feel sorry for them. Occasionally you will come across a self-injurer who claims to have been [[Almost_raped|raped]], [http://community.livejournal.com/anyotherworld/1578629.html beaten by drunken family members], [[schizophrenic|hear voices]] and/or otherwise [http://community.livejournal.com/_knowyoulive/3333721.html have a pretty fucked-up life]. Sometimes these claims are even true.

Whether true or not, whenever this happens other self-injurers will invariably assure them that they are perfect, that [http://community.livejournal.com/_knowyoulive/3330471.html "everyone feels like this"] and that [[Truth|therapy is completely unnecessary]]. This contributes to a [[Fox News|fair and balanced]] worldview which leads them into exciting and lucrative careers such as ''[http://community.livejournal.com/_knowyoulive/3331137.html sub par actress]'' and ''[[Jack Sparrow|male prostitute]]''.

== Self Injury in Fashion==

<video type="youtube" id="UZt2_kqoqqI" width="560" desc="'''Let's go stylish with wrist-cutting! [[moonspeak|かわいい!!!]]'''" height="340" frame="true" position="center"/>

[[Crazy|Breaking bones]], [[Psychotic|removing fingers]] or [[Batshit insane|dripping acid on your balls]] is only sexy if you frequent [[BME]]. However, society is taking baby steps towards accepting all forms of self-destructive behavior as fashionable; take the increasing fashionability of drugs. From [[Weed|light drug use]] to [[Meth|heavy drug abuse]] to [[Houston|PCP-induced eye removal]]; from drug abuse to [[Addiction|drug addiction]] to [[Heath Ledger|death by drug overdose]]. In each case, the lattermost has become the most fashionable of late.

In the same <font color="red">'''vein'''</font> ([[Pun|OMG PUN]]!), cutting has become somewhat of a fashion trend in recent years. It goes along with straightened/dyed hair and the [[trendy]] clothes (including skintight shirts, [[Castrating|genital-crushing]] tight pants, arm warmers and wearing hundreds of shitty plastic bracelets) with the added convenience of requiring minimal maintenance. If you don't cut then all your other emo friends will hate you, and that could be just [[Suicide|too much for your fragile mind to take]].

Richey Edwards of Manic Street Preachers famously cut the words <font color="red">'''''4 REAL'''''</font> into his arm just because he's so deep and [[hardcore]] (the fact that he was so "4 real" he avoided cutting "for" and stuck with the numeral because he's a pussy never gets mentioned).  Some years later he disappeared and hasn't been seen since; that's even more hardcore. If you wish to become hardcore like him, listening to much more [http://users.livejournal.com/call_me_cutie__/108394.html self-injury-related music] is essential.

Bouncy whore [[Lindsay Lohan]] is [[purportedly]] a cutter, prompting members of the [[LJ]] cutting community to attack her because [http://community.livejournal.com/_knowyoulive/3331137.html "she's going to give cutters a bad name"]. Before this news broke they, of course, [[Truth|had an extremely positive public image]].

A [[fucktarded]] [[Slayer]] fan cut the word <font color="red">'''''SLAYER'''''</font> into his arm and sent the [[picture]] for use in an album.

[[Image:Slayer_arm.jpg|thumb|A hardcore Slayer fan shows his [[faggotry|devotion]].]]

[[Some argue|Recent research has concluded definitively]] that all [[My Chemical Romance]] fans are self-injurers. All that live now, all that have ever lived and all that even considered being a [[fan]].

== Negative Effects of Self Injury==

* Pathetic [[psychological]] [[addiction]]. When communicating with a self-injurer, be sure to point out the obvious similarities between SI and crack-smoking, as many of these individuals are [[Straight edge|virulently anti-drug]] (especially those who take [[psychiatric]] drugs daily). They will often claim to be addicted to their behavior because the added prestige of calling oneself an addict adds to the mystique. If you hear such a claim, then the most pro-social course of action is to offer them some real drugs. 
** Naturally, the world-weary self-injurer will respond by [[Bullshit|claiming to have "been there, done that"]]despite being only 16 years old. Try to reveal their ignorance in a public forum by asking them some "tricky" questions about drugs (e.g. "Have you ever done both LSD ''and'' acid in the same day?")
* Complete [[failure]] to ever grow the fuck up, even when you are no longer a teenager (see {{ljcomm|21_gashes}}).
* [[circumcision|Hideous scars]] all over your body ensuring that practically no one will want to fuck you.
* You'll get [[AIDS]] all over your mom's good razor.

== Positive Effects of Self Injury ==

[[Image:Icutmyselftoincreasemylame.png |thumb|A fragile mind.]]

[[Image:Fuckingdoitalready.jpg|thumb|right|An emo cutter makes a plea for [[help|fail]].]]

* See [[smoking]] and [[drug#crack|crack]].
* Some girl might think you're cool and let you [[fuck]] her before she hangs herself over not being able to watch Big Brother.
* Make some lucky rapist very happy. 
** Females who self injure are incredibly easy to [[rape]] for several reasons. Firstly, though they are not always [[fat]], they are without exception weaklings, so they won't put up much of a fight in any event. Secondly, they are frequently losing consciousness from massive blood loss and exorbitant drug consumption, which obviously makes things a lot easier. Thirdly, they generally have incredibly low [[self-esteem]] and equally low [[intelligence]], so you can smack them around and have them choke on your [[cock]] daily and they'll think they're being showered with affection. It just goes to show that there is a purpose for all of God's creatures.
* If you [[die]], the world will become a better place!
* Boosting the sagging [[economy]] and generating [[profits]] for third-world laborers as follows:
** Increase sales of the tools of the trade - butane lighters, razor blades, etc.
** Massive increase in the number of long-sleeved t-shirts sold and windfall profits for clothing companies that make them. [[419|Invest now]], since they're gonna be wearing them for a long time. Scars are for life and by age 21, self injurers' arms begin to resemble a [http://www.baristanet.com/CurlyWurly.jpg Cadbury's CurlyWurly].
* [[Lulz]] for everyone else.

== Self Injury: The [[Cult]] of The Internet Age ==

Self injury can behave as a contagious [[disease]] exclusive to the Internet Age, spreading via [[blogs]], [[LJ]], [[MySpace]], et cetera. The cheapness of digital cameras and emergence of [[Web 2.0]] has allowed those that would normally be committed for sharing and imaging their behavior to congregate [[OTI]]. For those brave enough to get out of their basements and meet up with other [[Insane|like-minded individuals]], the inevitable result is a blood orgy fuckfest with others who also worship denial and embrace sociopathy. 

The spreading of sob-stories and drooling over [http://www.psyke.org/pictures/ gory pics] culminate in get-togethers where the self loathers drink non alcoholic beverages, then pretend to get drunk and start slicing each other up like Edward Scissorhands at a [http://www.cuddleparty.com Cuddle party]. They are like sharks: the sight of blood excites and arouses them so very much that they feel the desire to chow down on each others sweet, sweet blood cells.

These gatherings should be encouraged since they work out particularly well for the human race in general, as a fair number [[emos]] and self loathers have long been infected with [[HIV]] as a result of the only sex they can get - [[Glory hole|anonymous, receptive anal sex]].

Sadly, we have to count on AIDS to do in these inhuman beasts. Statistics by real professional [[scientists]] show that self injury leads to suicide only about 0.00015% of the time.

{{squote|I am [[addicted]] to it. I can’t stop. I did it last night... The thought of the [[pain]] just wakes me up... Makes me want it more and more... My [[mom]] found out about it, and didn’t do anything but ask me to stop, I can’t, I won’t... It makes me feel alive, like I am here for a brief moment in life... My [[girlfriend]] asked me to stop too, but I broke that promise a week ago, I held out for a month... [[erection|Then the urge got to big]]... 

The blade practically fell into my waiting hand, and then touched my [[foreskin|skin]], it was [[poetry]], so beautiful, and the [[pain]], addicting as always, so addicting my hand wouldn’t stop it kept digging deeper and deeper, nothing could stop me.|[http://psyke.org/pictures/r/razeorangel/index.html RazeOrAngel]|a dangerously [[insane]] individual.}}

Once in a while you may come across an extreme case of self injury by skeletor-esque emo girls [http://www.documentingreality.com/forum/f10/some-emo-girl-needs-serious-help-11192/ Lulz]

== How to [[Troll]] Self-Injurers ==

* Tell them it's "just cultural". It is.
* Tell them that "starving [[Africans]] don't self-harm , because they have REAL problems."
* Tell them that it's just another [[teen]] [[fad]] and that they'll grow out of it.
* Tell them [[Bikerfox]] doesn't cut himself, why should they?
* Ask how old they are and what music they like, then act surprised when they reveal that they are 16 years old and like Fallout Boy. Self-injury and emo go together like [[Raver|acid techno]] and [[Drugs|horse tranquilizers]]. 
* Call them attention seekers. If they respond by saying that they NEVER show ANYONE their scars, ask them why the fuck they put their ghoulish bullshit on [[YouTube]]. 
** If they protest that ''they'' aren't on YouTube, post links to random self-injurers. Keep at it until they post a video themselves trying to quash the terrible rumors you've been spreading, then accuse them of being [[liars]] and hypocrites.
* [[Spam]] links to [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Self_injury this page] all over self-injury related communities, YouTube, and anywhere else where self-injurers congregate.
* Explain to them that if they werent self harming for attention, then they wouldent tell anyone.
