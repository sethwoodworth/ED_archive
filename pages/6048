Inspired by [[Operation Lemonaide]], operation <span style="padding:0 6px;background-color:black;color:yellow;">'''Lemon Party'''</span> is an [[IRL]] raid that aims to convince [[You|Britfags]] that the <span style="padding:0 6px;background-color:black;color:yellow;">'''Lemon Party'''</span> are a new political party, which are against [[FOB|foreigners]], the expenses scandal and things that [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|35-year-old, upper-middle class, daily mail reading, BNP supporting, never-worked-a-day-in-her-life, only-rich-because-she-got-knocked-up-by-her-husband-who-now-screws-the-sectary]] women dislike.

These women, known by [[chavs]] as [[skanks|WAGS]] see posters around their cities and visit the site [[lemon party|lemonparty.org]], as advertised on the [[Old Media|posters]] only to find [[lulz]]

FACT: <span style="padding:0 6px;background-color:black;color:yellow;">'''Lemon Parties'''</span> main opposition is [[lies|teh BNP]]
