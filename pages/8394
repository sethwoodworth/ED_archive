'''thoseskinnygirls''', also known as '''The skinny perfectionists''', is a [[MySpace]] group for [[e-pals]] of [[Ana]] and [[Mia]], filled with [[n00b]] [[thinspiration]], and a playground for [[trolls]] and those who feed off pointless drama. Like all things MySpace, it's just a shitty version of its [[LJ]] counterpart, {{ljcomm|pro_ana}}.



==A brief history of [[batshit]]ness==
According to [[Purelily]], when [[God]] created the world, and all the creatures that inhabit it, he thought he was doing good. Everything was made perfect, with a purpose, and all creatures were [[rich and beautiful]], without [[W|evil]] or [[STD|diseases]]. But not even God, in all his omnipotence, could foresee the [[Shitting dick nipples|fall of man]] that would ruin the world forever, filling it with [[blacks]] and [[jews]]. So ruined in fact, that God had to send his Son off to kill millions of [[ppl]] [[:Image:Insanity_diagram.png|with a sword coming out of his mouth]] someday in order to fix it and destroy all [[sick fucks]].

Similarly, when [[Tom]] [[cuntpaste|created]] [[MySpace]], and all the [[b0rk|features]] that inhabit it, he thought he was doing good. Everything was made perfect, with a purpose, and all [[HTML]] was readable, without [[Jakejekyll|killers]] or [[Tila Tequila|whores]]. And if God didn't know [[shit]] about the [[obvious]] [[failure]] of his creation, Tom can't be exactly blamed for not knowing that MySpace would bring forth a couple of the many signs of the [[apocalypse]]. People, prepare for getting [[in the ass|gang raped]] by Jesus' tongue sword.

Enter '''thoseskinnygirls'''.

==No wannarexics==
Founded on [[last thursday|January 27, 2006]] by a [[16 year old girl]] known as Elle from [[California]], '''thoseskinnygirls''' is a [[MySpace]] group, which is kind of like a [[gay]] [[eljay]] [[community]] and a shit copy from Hi5's group feature. Groups are basically everyday's [[attention whore]]'s tools of trade, since they appear listed on their profiles and can be used to make them appear more [[OMG]] mysterious and interesting, without needing to actually post or contribute in them (proving once again that MySpace is like a gay LiveJournal).

[[Image:Bonebeauty.jpg|thumb||[[DO NOT WANT|Hott]]]]
Regardless, thoseskinnygirls falls into the 1[[%]] of groups that are actually used by those who join them. [[Clearly]], it's because unlike most groups that fall in the "normal" category ([http://groups.myspace.com/goldengirls Golden Girls fan group], [http://groups.myspace.com/nirvana Nirvana FTW group], or {{protected|link=[http://groups.myspace.com/cockintheass the cock in the ass group]}})'', thoseskinnygirls is a [[pro-ana]] group.

===The Thin Anamments===
As they were delivered from Ana herself to [[ED|us]]:
* If you aren't [[goth|thin]], you aren't [[hot|attractive]].
* Being thin is more important than being healthy.
* You must [[Hot Topic|buy clothes]], [[cut]] your hair, take [[goatse|laxatives]], [[pro-ana|starve yourself]], do anything to make yourself look thinner.
* Thou shall not eat without feeling [[internet trial|guilty]].
* Thou shall not eat [[Pizza and beer|fattening foods]] without punishing oneself afterwards.[[Image:Anaforeplay.jpg|thumb|Anas can easily trick [[necrophilia]]cs]]
* Thou shall [[cunt|count]] [[cum|calories]] and restrict [[Oral sex|intake]] accordingly.
* What the scale says is the [[e-penis|most important thing]].
* [[Obvious|Losing weight is good/gaining weight is bad]].
* You can [[Never forget|NEVER]] be to (''[[sic]]'') thin.
* Being thin and not eating are signs of true will [[Unlimited disposable income|power and success]].

==[[Drama bomb]]s on thoseskinnygirls: a step-by-step guide==
If you go to [[Africa]]'s deserts and find a small tribe of [[AIDS]]-infected [[children]], you will probably notice they ''are'' thin -- Ana-perfect thin, even! However, if you offer them [[food]], they'll go fucking nuts for it and eat it like it's lulzcon in desperation.

Ana girls are [[stupid]] [[luser]] [[fucktards]] that think it's okay to throw away food and [[vomit]] it away when all over the [[world]] people are unwillingly thinspirational and dying from starvation. Moreover, ana girls on thoseskinnygirls are stupid luser fucktards that ''[[You fail it|fail at life]]'' because their thinspiration is what the rest of anas would diss as [[n00b]]. [[Srsly]], the [[Olsen Twins]]? No wannarexics? thoseskinnygirls ''are'' [[asking for it]].

So, if you are a [[ohbutyouwillpet|good, decent citizen]] that loves [[America]], you will want to [[Drama bomb]] them. How, you might ask?

The technique is simple:
* Make [[troll]] profile account
* Upload [[pictures plz]] from another ana community
* Fill the profile with thinspiriation rants
* Apply for membership at desired drama bomb drop point
* Start topic with [[Fat|Queen Latifah]], [[YOU wouldn't fit into an MRI either!|Mo'nique]], [[Shay]], [[Iworshipsatin]], or any other [[BBW]] as your [[thinspiration]]
* [[DO NOT WANT]] replies
* Take snapshot and [[Special:Upload|follow instructions]]
* ??????
* [[PROFIT]]!
