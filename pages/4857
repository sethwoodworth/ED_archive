Lindsey Graham
[[Image:LindseyGrahamLooksForPenis.png|thumb|right|235px|So confused as to his gender, Senator Graham has to have soldiers find his [[penis]] for him.]]
'''Lindsay Graham''' is a [[Republican]] senator from the [[America|American]] state of [[South Carolina]], known for not being able to make his up damn mind about anything, including whether or not [[trap|his name is actually a girl's]], or even if he likes being a Republican at all. As such, he is [[attention whore|living proof]] that the state of [[South Carolina]] has managed to produce [[Mark Sanford|almost everything wrong]] with the Republican Party as of 2009.

He is famous for being the only senator that can be [[science|scientifically]] noted as being [[puppy|cute as a button]], a result of being the most obvious [[homosexual|fannybandit]] still serving in the United States Senate -- even if, [[Larry Craig|unlike his colleagues]] he's never been [[fap|caught in the act]]. 

Appearing on [[Foxnews|FauxNews]] every thirty minutes to remind America that he is the first [[faggot|gay man]] seriously running for president, he recently married [[Greta Van Susteren|Greta van Susteren]] in a [[fail|failed]] attempt to convince everyone [[not gay|he was straight]], apparently remembering at the very last minute that [[fact|Republicans despise homosexuals even if they are homosexual themselves]]. She divorced him, however, as she was too busy furiously masturbating over and over to pictures of [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson's]] funeral.

Poor Lindsey doesn't even know where he is half the time, or what [[cock|party]] he likes:
