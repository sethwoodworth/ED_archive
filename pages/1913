'''[http://www.cuteoverload.com Cute Overload]''' is, as the title implies, an obnoxiously cute website specializing in baby animals, more baby animals, and grown animals that look like baby animals. The site also provides the [[sauce]] material for many animal [[image macro]]s, though most are of the [[I Can Has Cheezburger|ICHC]] variety. 

The founder and main poster, Meg, communicates with randomly [[ALL CAPS|CAPITALIZED]] words, textual renditions of a bad French accent, and a strange vernacular of her own devising -- half "lolcat," half baby talk. Commenters slavishly imitate her and repeat "dead from cute" and "omg brain esplody!" ''ad nauseam''.

[[Some argue]] that Meg is an obnoxious [[retard]], but others point out that her particular brand of disgusting cuteness has probably provided her with [[unlimited disposable income]] from a job that involves looking at puppies all day.

==Ridiculous drama==
One might not expect a website about cute animals to have any [[drama]] beyond people arguing over what color of [[cat|kitten]] is the cutest, but when one remembers that the site's primary audience is [[PETA]]fags, [[crazy]] cat ladies, and [[16-year-old girls]], one recognizes the potential for limitless idiocy.

===Cats 'n' Racks===
One ongoing controversy concerns the image category [http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/cats_n_racks/index.html Cats 'n' Racks], which obviously involves cats (and sometimes other animals) hanging out in between chicks' [[boobs]]. Predictably, every time one of these gets posted, some [[feminist]] has to get [[butthurt]] about all the [http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/02/cats_n_racksits.html#comments sexism], or compare it to [[porn]] even though there are no nips ever, or just make stupid comments about "omg claws!" like that'll somehow dissuade hot girls from putting kittens down their shirts (it never does, thank God).

===[[This looks shopped]]===
In some cases, cute pictures are [http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/02/update_co_mailb.html obviously shopped]. In others, they are [http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/02/this_is_like_bl.html#comment-14120376 obviously not]. Regardless, someone will inevitably assert that they can tell by the pixels, and accuse the site of [[lie|fraud]].

*[http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/07/loveexciting_an.html#comment-20370213 "Uh, I'm 99.9999% sure this is photoshopped... I don't doubt that they were in those positions separately, but the tails are very 'shopped looking."]
*[http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/12/look_im_sure_th.html That's shopped? Really? Gosh, you guys are smart.]

===Cat washing===
Did you know that washing a cat is abusive and will traumatize it for life? It's not like cats have an effective long-term memory of about two hours, or anything. No, if you wash your cat for any reason, it will never recover. Unless it had fleas, or got splattered with paint, or has a skin condition, or was sprayed by a skunk. Those are legitimate reasons, so kitty will be fine.

*[http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/01/cat_bath.html Double drama: cat-bathing and tits].

===Tasty animals===
It's probably not a good idea to allow a cat to play with [http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2007/05/oversnorgle_of_.html baby rabbits], or to give a dog a [http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/09/love_pain.html chick], unless you want to clean the results out of your carpet. 

However, because so many of the site's readers are rabidly [[childfree]], the biggest animal-eating drama ever was sparked by [http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/06/cuteoverload_ma.html a baby gnawing on a cat]. Commenters were convinced that the cat was being tortured, and rooted for it to turn on its vicious sprog oppressor and claw the shit out of it. The sentimental mommies of the site, on the other hand, lamented the parenting stupidity that could place a cat and a baby in the same room.

Coming in a close second was the drama caused by posting pictures of an [[azn]] baby drooling on a puppy, because someone had to whip out the [http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/08/learning_to_sno.html#comment-20623942 Korean food jokes], and then the rest of the thread involved everyone insisting that they don't find racist jokes funny, the liars.

===OMG SWEARS===
Meg once posted a picture of an irritated cat sitting on a toilet seat with the title "[http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2007/11/get-out-of-my-g.html Get out of my goddamn pink bathroom]." The reaction would lead one to believe that most of the commenters had never been to a website besides CO, and had thus never been exposed to such horrifically foul language. 

*[http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2007/11/get-out-of-my-g.html#comment-89774852 "Yeah, not to be a prude, b/c I'm not, and I generally think people can say whatever they like; however, the GD in the title isn't cute."]
*[http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2007/11/get-out-of-my-g.html#comment-89779042 "I come here to look at cute pictures, not to see God's name taken in vain."]
*[http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2007/11/get-out-of-my-g.html#comment-89794178 "'G..D...' in the title is TEWTALLY not necessary!!! And not cute!!!"]
*[http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2007/11/get-out-of-my-g.html#comment-89795086 "when, oh when, will people stop blaming meg for what these potty-mouthed animals are saying?"]

==[[Slashdot]]ted==
In March of 2006, Slashdot linked to CO, which had the usual [[DDOS]] effect. In retaliation, one of the CO posters put up a retarded list of [http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/03/co_discovered_b.html nerd stereotypes] that were [[old meme]] in junior high.

Slashdot, being used to this sort of thing, decided to ignore it and turn their site [http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/2006/04/cute_overload_g_1.html pink] as an [[April Fool's]] prank instead.
