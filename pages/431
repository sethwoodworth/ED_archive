An Herpo

'''An Herpo''' is the act of attempting to do something [[An_Hero|profound]], but failing so hard at it (and life in general) that you cannot even get the most basic details right. In the process, you inadvertently provide boundless joy to millions through the [[epic lulz]] your failure has produced. It is also a [[13_year_old_boy|funny word to say]].


On the evening of June 23, 2010, a [[basement_dweller|'sad, lonely anon']] was (apparently) contemplating [[an hero]], but needed some guidance and support in his decision. [[Dumb|Naturally]], he turned to [[/b/]], as they are [[Not|renowned]] for their [[Internet_hate_machine|compassion, maturity and totally solid advice]], particularly in [[Serious_Business|serious and solemn situations]]. In writing his request, he in fact asked for advice on how to '''an herpo''', which then sparked a [[lollercoaster]] of a proportion /b/ rarely sees these days. 


Immediately after reading his [[lulzy]] request, the [[b-tards]] began pissing themselves at what they had quite accidentally stumbled upon: that rarest of [[internets|internet]] beasts, the [[Forced_Meme|unforced meme]]. The lulz continued unabated as literally <strike>dozens</strike> billions of anons [[Fail|did their best]] to bring 'an herpo' into their internets vernacular, creating [[MS_Paint|awesome shoops]] and posting [[retarded|witty, clever and totally original]] usages of their new favorite phrase. The thread did indeed reach [[epic]] proportions, and at that moment a new [[meme]] was [[Not|born]].
