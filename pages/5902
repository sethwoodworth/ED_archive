An absolutely fantastic [[social networking]] website with a focus on person-to-person matchmaking and showcasing extreme examples of [[internet disease]].
== Features ==
*'''Matchmaking''' - Based on [[at least 100]] pieces of information provided when you sign up, [http://www.okcupid.com OKCupid!'s] algorithms locate other [[pedophiles]] with whom you are sure to enjoy a fruitful relationship.  All potentials are assigned a percentage for compatibility.  The complex nature of these calculations ensures that you will be no more than a 75[[Statistics|%]] match with yourself. The matching system also has a very [[Shit|useful]] feature built in. When searching for potential matches, it finds "matches" based solely on location, not by personality, ideals, or anything else that might actually be useful when using a dating site. Of course, everyone knows that ALL PEOPLE WITH THE SAME THOUGHTS LIVE IN THE SAME, EXACT PLACES.
**''"Improve Your Matches"'' is a never-ending survey featuring [[retard|user]]-submitted questions. It is important to look at how your potential "matches" utilize this survey, because if they answered more than five questions, they probably have a serious [[disorder]] and should not be dated.
*'''Tests''' - Once you have an account, you must immediately create a "test".  Typically, a test includes at least three but no more than 5 questions.  Popular subjects include, "The which brand of hemorrhoid cream are you Test" and "The To What Extent Are You [[Hardcore]] Test".  [http://www.okcupid.com OKCupid!] encourages creativity by prepending and appending "The" and "Test" to every test's name, respectively.  All tests return yet another meaningful [[Statistics|percentage]] indicative of your performance.  With any luck, [http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=5349989821747660792 your test] will be insightful and rise to [http://www.okcupid.com/tests/list?rank=alltime the top of the "most popular" list], becoming a [[meme]].
*'''Gay''' - Upon registration, you will [http://www.okcupid.com/profile?tuid=9445775883982528876 catch teh gay].  An initial [[gay]] infection usually results in a [[gay]] index of at least 60[[Statistics|%]], but no more than 90[[Statistics|%]].

== Appeal ==
[http://www.okcupid.com OKCupid!] was designed from the ground up to appeal to everyday [[pedophiles]].  One may also find [[camwhores]], [[drama queens]], [[gays]], and [[emo|emo kids]] with broken [[High contrast|contrast knobs]] on their webcams.

The creators of the site (professed Harvard graduates) originally insisted that they did not wish to profit from their site.  Those more familiar with the situation realize that [http://www.okcupid.com OKCupid!] did not charge for its services because at least 100[[Statistics|%]] of [[pedophiles]]' Paypal accounts have been frozen for attempting to sell [[child porn]] on [[eBay]].

In the summer of 2009, however, they reversed their stance, introducing a special "A-List" status for users who wished to buy a paid subscription to the site. A-List users are spared the sight of banner advertisements and other inconveniences. In other words, the siteâ€™s owners reckoned that anyone too stupid to install an ad-blocking plugin for their web browser might also be stupid enough to help foot the monthly tab for [[hookers and blow]].

All women on the website, whether or not they care enough to pay for it, will weigh a minimum of 400 pounds, have 9 kids, and want their prospective mates to financially support them. They demand any guy who contacts them be a bodybuilder and be wealthy.

Statistics show that the average OKCupid user is also into [[Wicca]], [[vegetarian|vegetarianism]], [[polyamory]], [[socialism]], and quite possibly, the consumption of human feces.  If you think this is a joke, feel free to browse OKCupid for yourself.

== Tests ==
As mentioned above, OKCupid has a variety of user-made tests in addition to special, higher-quality ones made by its staff.  Presumably this is done for fun, although this might also help the more discriminating nerd find a suitable lover:  "You'd be a black mage, too?"  

More sample test topics include:

*Which type of STD are you?
*The "Would I let you finger my asshole" test
*What color is your poop?
*The "How would you die at Auschwitz" test
*What kind of laxative would you be in a [[Steampunk]] world?
*How big of a whore are you?
*Are you Emo and gay?(answers always yes)
*How many fat chicks hitting on you does it take to make you leave this site? Test.

Usually, tests are made by people who could barely pass tests designed for middle-schoolers; consequently, neither the questions nor the results make much sense.

== Forums ==
[[Last Thursday]], OKCupid came out with its own forums; immediately thereafter, the first OKCupid forums [[troll]] was born.  The OKCupid forums are a great place to see people bitch over women not contacting them back and also a place for [[furry|furries]], [[wicca|Wiccans]], and [[liberals]] to preach the virtues of their perversions.  [[Odumcarlock|OdumCarlock]] is one of the forum's most prolific and [[Retard|easily angered]] posters.

<b>Update</b> - On February 15, 2009, the OkCupid mods went insane and [[Delete fucking everything|deleted almost everyone]] interesting who posted on the forums. Those responsible may include:

Fireknight159 - Born more than 100 years ago, Fireknight159 is a psuedo-intellectual faggot who babbles on and uses so many big words that his posts are incoherent. Loves to follow users around like a puppy dog and flag them.

Somelocalartist - Somelocalidiot hasn't had a girlfriend in more than [[9000]] years, and decided to get attention and kudos by following users around and flagging everything they say.
