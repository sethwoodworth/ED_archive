[[Image:DTNO.jpg|thumb|right]400 px|Darrentmail at his arraignment. Obviously, that is the face of PURE [[evil|EVIL]]!]] Darrentmail is an [[IMDb]] user, often referred to as DT. He hates [[preps]] with a passion.  He also hates [[Ice-Ice-Baby]] with a passion.  He is real [[serious business]] and was arrested on December 2, 2006. He had many rants posted against "teenybopper preps".  DT had also been keeping various [[guns|weapons]] like "an AK-47-like semiautomatic rifle, 22 rounds of ammo and a bat with protruding nails" he dubbed the “ugly stick.” In an Oct. 13 online posting, Thompson said he came up with the weapon’s name “because it can (expletive) someone up and make them ‘ugly.’ ”[http://news.bostonherald.com/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=170086] He causes much [[internet drama]] and [[lulz]].

* He has various weapon collections.  He likes to collect [[guns|AKs]],and swords.  He, on several occasions, has asked [[Ice-Ice-Baby|Ice-Ice-Ugly]] to show up in his town so he can carve her up/[[rape]] her.   
* He buys some KILLER SWEET ASS swords at a store called Xswords.  [[lulz|LULZ]] don't they know he is [[insane]].
* He claims to be a chef even though he is a renowned [[basement dweller]].
* He totally wants to have [[buttsex]] with big-nosed [[Ice-Ice-Baby]].

==DT and Preps==

He was picked on by preps and was sick of it and bashs them on [[imdb]] on the Jesse McCartney boards, thinking he was making a difference. DT has stated that he would like to blow up prep stores like Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister and Old Navy.  DT also states he is [[virgin|waiting for marriage]].  [[LOL]], what a [[fag]].

==DT and the Jesse McCartney Board==

* DT looms over the Jesse McCartney boards, with his army of anti-preps.  Any time someone is identified as a prep, he envelopes them with his same old anti-prep propaganda.
===DT's postings to preps===
* "Preps are emasculated pussies, and they picked on me when I was little. Wah Wah Wah! I hate preps! Why didn't my mommy love me? I hate preps!"
*"I like to drink and smoke, because that is what people are supposed to do. One time I got really drunk and smoked a lot and that was cool."

==DT is a Good guy at heart==
DT may be whiny and annoying, but is a good guy at heart.  (This was added so the [[psychopath|psycho]] doesn't use his swords to chop me up.)

Forget we said that. He is not a good guy and can kill you all.

==DT's secret==
[[Image:dtandosama.jpg|thumb|right]400 px|DT and Osama chatting about how they should kill all teenyboppers]]
Many on the boards knew that he was a chef at a hotel but little knew of his secret occupation as a member of Al Qaida.  Everyone thinks that Al Qaida was against america but they're actually against preps.  Apparrently,  9/11 was just a mix-up.  They confused the twin towers with a nearby Abercrombie and Fitch store.  I'm sure soon DT will run away to Afghanistan and live in Osama's cave until they come up with a perfect way to extinguish the world of preps.

==DT's IN [[jail|JAIL]] [[LULZ]]!!!==

About time [[police|coppers]]! He was a [[psychopath]]! HE COULD'VE KILLED US ALL!!!!
