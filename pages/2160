Defending the Truth
{{old}}


'''[http://defendingthetruth.com Defending the Truth]''' is the home of sage political commentary, and profound political strategy &mdash;  all this on a simple [[message board]].  The attentive reader searching for [[truth]] will discover that Jane Fonda does not deserve the forgiveness of the [[American]] public for [[liberalism|joining the Viet Cong]].  Further perusing will convince you that [[liberal]]s are hypocritical and intolerant, and that [[George W. Bush]] is not as bad a fellow as [[Hitler]].  The serious [[political science]] [[student]] should subscribe to the [[RSS]] feeds so as to decipher the pulse of [[mainstream]] America.

Oh, and every so often, you will find a reactionary [[Democrat]] floating around.  Just [[ignore]] them.
