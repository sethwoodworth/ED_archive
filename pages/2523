'''e621''' is one of many sites where [[sex]]-depraved [[furfags]] go to post and look at [[gay]] [[porn]]. Unlike [[FurAffinity]], it has way less text, and you can rip off other furries' artwork all you like without having to worry about getting [[banned]]. It was previously run by Arcturus Nova, a former [[mod]] on [[FurAffinity]] that was [[fired]] because she started [http://community.livejournal.com/furaffinity/47629.html deopping mods that couldn't spell].

After recent reports and threats to their host, e621 was shut down permanently when it was claimed they housed [[loli|child pornography]] and illegally posted artwork. However, it was really the work of [[furaffinity|butthurt furfags]], especially due to the remarkable efforts of {{furaffinity|insanekangaroo|insanekangaroo}}, a loyal furaffinity member who sided with [[Dragoneer]] to try and derail Arcturus's reputation after some DMCA drama involving use of the e621 mascot as artwork hosted on FurAffinity. They succeeded, but it added another notch onto Dragoneer's pile of [[gay|faggotry]].<br/>Business as usual, yet you wouldn't imagine the leading website on all things furry being overrun by a smaller one like e621, a simple imageboard! [[Dragoneer]] just couldn't let that happen, but he can always count on his whiteknights.<br/><br/>Fun Fact: [[FurAffinity]] is still filled with the same shit that got e621 into trouble. Oh well, you know the story now.

{{quote|Thanks to numerous threats to our host, false claims of illegal content, harassment and [[rape|a few things that are much worse]], e621 is being closed down permanently. It's been fun running it. If you're looking for an alternative, try dammitfreehaven.com or something. If you want to come in and bitch at us, #e621 on irc.darkmyst.org will be a place you can do that. Or you can yell at me on twitter, twitter.com/ajkirwin or just email admin@e621.net and scream at me. Whatever.

[[Winrar|And to all those who have lied and threatened and caused problems, well, congratulations. You got what you wanted I suppose. One site down, only about, what, fifty thousand left to go?]]|Arcturus|crying like a bitch.}}

==New Host==
[[image:e621isback.png|thumb|right|Oh look. It's back.]]
e621 administrator Varka, founder of ''[[Bad Dragon]]'', decided to take control due to Arcturus not being able to handle being a victim of [[trolling]]. Now [[furries]] can return to sparking drama over badly-drawn pornography.
