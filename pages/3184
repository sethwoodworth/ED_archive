Stands for "good game". Typically used on [[IRC]] specifically [[insub]]. Can also stand for "good going".

Also used at the end of [[internets]] action games such as ''[[Half-Life]]'', ''[[Deus Ex]]'' or ''[[Yahoo!]] Spades'' to signify that the game was fun. Some variations might include "gga" (good game all) or just "ggp" (good game partner). "gg nextmap" is also derived from these games, and outside such environments is synonymous with "[[pwned]]", like when [[nerds]] beat you at ''Mario Kart''.

[[IRL]] a "good game" comment is usually followed with a [[asspat|pat on the person's ass]]. This is because most athletes are gay and see way too much [[faggotry|man-on-man]] action.

== Alternate Meaning ==

Used when another person fucks up and loses at whatever they're doing, to the [[lulz]] of everyone else. In fact, "GG" is rarely used to actually describe a good game.

=== Example ===
:'''Prima''': I followed your advice and deleted [[system32]].
:'''Secunda''': gg

:'''Prima''': I just upgraded to [[Vista]] today.
:'''Secunda''': gg

Can additionally be used to indicate one's belief that their own victory is certain, though the game has yet to end.  Often times they are wrong and get rocked.

=== Example ===
:'''Prima''': WTF? Nc2+ ?!?
:'''Secunda''': gg
:'''Prima''': Rxc2++!! ... noob
