Sony Entertainment, ruler of evil-doer Korea, let slip during the last E3 that it was developing a new game clearly marketed to the fetishist demographic.

She's Fat Princess, the star of Sony's upcoming video game of the same name. Debuting at [[last Thursday]]'s E3 expo, the colorful ''Fat Princess'' is a capture-the-flag game with a twist: you can thwart [[rape|capture]] attempts by locking the [[pro-ana|once-thin]] princess in a [[BDSM|dungeon]] and stuffing her full of cake, thereby increasing her girth and making her [[Your resistance only makes my penis harder!|harder]] for your enemies to haul back to home base. [[WTF]]?!

There are other unique, fun, and interesting gaming elements to it, but [[shit nobody cares about|nobody gives a shit.]]

==Fat Princess and the Internet==

Just like anything else in the modern world, Feminists everywhere are up in arms with butthurt over ''[[your mom|Fat Princess]]'' and have spewed their penis-hating blather onto the internet, complete with half-assed attempts at pretending to be smart enough to operate a keyboard. It's a rare occurrence that you can make one of the sweating, heaving, mounds of flesh put down the fucking fork long enough to make protesting noises. E-scientists have put forward a theory on why [[feminists]], who by definition are fat, are blasting a game starring a fat chick.

==Downloadable Crap==
[[Last Thursday]] the game developers released an [[shit nobody cares about|update]] for Fat Princess which added three new classes players could dick around with and generally be a [[Sweet bro and hella jeff|useless piece of shit]]: 
A [[macrophile|giant]], a [[13 year old boy|pirate]] and a [[13 year old boy|ninja]]. The ''Fat Princess'' forums were filled with people bawwing about the classes being broken and having to [[shit nobody cares about|wait]] to use them, but because Fat Princess is [[Elton John|old and gay]], not a shit was given that day. At any rate, the game is now fap material for [[macrophile|macrophiles]] and [[BBW|chubby chasers]].
==Fetish Game==
The [[sick fuck]]s at [[BBWChan]] have a thread on this game found here.[http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/http://bbw-chan.net/bbwart/res/1242.html]

It's only a matter of time before your games are rated D for dickgirls.
