'''Skinny jeans'''[[Shit nobody cares about| (also known as skinnies, drainpipe pants, pencil pants, nut hugger jeans, cigarette pants, etc.)]] are....well if you were too [[retarded]] to not figure it out already, are [[Obvious|jeans that are skinny]]. Skinny jeans originated sometime in the 1950's and were mostly worn by men with [[micropenis|little tiny Azn dicks]]. During those [[slavery|wonderful]] times, women didn't wear pants and had to resort to wearing skirts or [[win|nothing at all]]. But as time past, [[feminazis|some retarded women]] who didn't know their fucking place [[in the kitchen]] rebelled by wearing trousers that were similar in concept as skinny jeans. By the 1960's, women wearing jeans started becoming common and was spreading as fast as the [[cancer that is killing /b/]]. 

[[Image:Bustin OUT.jpg|thumb|150px|[[This is why we can't have nice things|THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS!!!]]]]

But like all [[shit|good things]], skinny jeans started getting worse and slimmer much like a nigger in the middle of Africa dying from a horrible case of [[AIDS]] with no hope of a cure. Nowadays, skinny jeans are [[typically]] worn by [[wimmenz]] and [[hipster|hipster fags]] who have no fucking [[balls]]. Skinny jeans can be both a blessing (if worn by the [[Mary Sue|right type of woman]]) and a disaster (if worn by [[faggots|men]] and [[fat]] women). Either way, you're going to find people ruining all the [[porn|eye candy]].

== How it all started ==
[[Image:Hbhjean.jpg|thumb|The truth!]]
Although skinny jeans may be normal when worn by [[cumdumpsters|females]], they were also considered [[gay]] when worn back in the days'' (much like it is now)''. It gained popularity when famous [[Sluts|celebrities]] such as [[Elvis]] and other [[hippies]] started wearing them. And from there on, skinny jeans became a fashion disaster that entered into the shit filled world of [[Emo|Rock 'n Roll]]. Amongst rockstars, it is known that the tighter the jeans, the more [[Gay|"awesome"]] they seem to be. As time continued to pass by, it seemed as though the skinny jeans fad took [[LSD|many different directions]]. [[Kill it with fire|All of which that were in need of instant extermination.]]

The trend began to expand and started being more diverse. Instead of men walking around in tight jeans, [[Lolwut|the world soon saw men walking in tights]], and even [[Wtf|spandex]]. It got to the point where [[not gay|straight men]] began [[Do Not Want|wearing make up and pantyhoes]]. And those were just the 70's; they got much worse in the 80's. Much like everything else in the [[Eighties|80's]], the skinny jeans from that time era was a complete fashion disaster. As the 80's began to die out, so did the skinny jeans fad. During the 1990's, skinny jeans were completely uncommon amongst men (unless of course you were a [[fag]]) and men began wearing normal and even baggy jeans thanks to [[Rap|booty gorilla nigger noise]]. But like all wondeful things, there was a catch. Bad enough was when you saw men show off their [[ass]] in skin tight pants, but even worse was when they started [[sagging]] them  and had to bleach your eyes from their man panties.

And thus, left us a decade of skin-tight pantsless world in favor of normal and baggier jeans. Now if only skinny jeans could have died with the 80's and never have came back... Or at least have them only worn by women.

Apparently, the world wasn't forever safe from skinny jeans dilemma. As the new millennium began, so did the revival of skinny jeans. Thanks to [[Hipsters]] ruining everything yet again, the fad that was once dead was revived and slowly making a comeback. Much like their [[crap|favorite]] indie bands, the public were quite skeptical and really didn't give a flying shit about them. And then out of nowhere came the [[Emos]], another group of faggots much like hipsters, but [[moar]] goth and [[suicidal]]. As emos are well known to wear smelly tight clothes, they just had to adopt them into their [[Pretentious|culture]]. 

Quickly discovering that emos had began wearing skinny jeans, the [[Scene|scenefags]] quickly followed and stole yet another fad popularized within the emo subculture. Eventually, skinny jeans started becoming popular amongst the [[Punk]] and [[Skater]] culture. It wasn't so bad when [[16 year old girls|women]] discovered that wearing skinny jeans [[asking for it|could give them more attention]] and have guys stare at their asses all day. Therefore boosting the self-esteem of [[all|some]] [[12 year old girls|ladies]] and making them feel like that [[Whore|special girl]] they always were.

=== Niggers? In my Skinny Jeans?!? ===
[[Image:Lilwayne.jpg|thumb|[[divide by zero|Sagging + skinny jeans = ???]].]]
[[Image:Nigger Skinnyjeans.jpg|thumb|125px|Totally [[not gay|no homo]], right dawg?]]
It was niggers who killed the trend, and it was niggers who made them even more popular. Ever since 2007, rap stars such as Lil Wayne (a closet faggot, [[srsly]]) and [[Soulja Boy]] have popularized skinny jeans within the [[AIDS|rap community]]. 

From then was it known that [[Internet tough guys|gangstas]] had to wear skinny jeans [[Ebonics|'cUz iT wHuZ ThUG LyFEe, NiqqA!!1]] Every [[Wigger|hardcore gangsta]] knew if they wanted stay [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|pimpin' fo' lyfee]], they had to get rid of their baggy jeans that was big enough to fit in 10 people inside ([[truth|which they needed in order to rob the liquor store of all of its grape juice and 40 oz's)]], which resulted in a wide spread robbery of every Levi's, Hot Topic, and any other store that sells skinny jeans committed by niggers. 

Not only have niggers adopted the skinny jeans, but they have added their own [[ghetto]] twist to it. With the [[Drug dealing|science education]] most niggers achieved from dropping out of kindergarten, they have managed to combine wearing skinny jeans and '''[[sagging]]''', which [[doubles]] the amount of faggotry. 

Already used to walking like penguins when they sag their pants, black people now have a much harder time trying to walk. In this sorry state, trying to escape from da police is now a much harder task seeing how they can barely move a muscle in those pants. 

But hey, look on the bright side, at least they won't get their jeans stuck on the fence like they used with their baggy jeans ([[implying|if they even can make it to the fence]]). This means a lower niggger population as the [[police]] catch them all! 

We also now know that niggers do not in fact have bigger dicks like they so love to claim every day because [[tiny dick|no normal sized dick]] could fit in when wearing skinny jeans. This should lower the nigger population even further as nobody wants a teeny little baby cock.


=== The Backlash ===
Indeed, it was hipsters who were responsible for bringing back the skinny jeans fad back into the public with their shitty Indie music whom nobody has heard of, their "''alternative''" way of seeing things, and flooding every [[Starbucks]] corner with their [[Apple|Macbooks]]. What they had not expected was having it become popular. You see, hipsters hate '''everything''' that is popular and mainstream, and the pants they revived was no exception. Soon, they started [[raging]] at the very sight of seeing non-hipsters wearing skinny jeans. From the [[irony]] of it all ensued the [[lulz]].

== Advantages of Skinny Jeans ==
[[Image:Spandex pants.jpg|thumb|[[A challenger appears]]!!]]
Despite having many obvious disadvantages, there are surprisingly a [[none|few]] advantages that come with [[Lies|wearing cootchie cutters]] and many that come with other people wearing them. Some of the advantages include but are not limited to
* [[Trolling]] Hipsters
* [[All|Most]] girls who wear skinny jeans apparently don't wear panties or go commando due to panty lines. That meaning not only can you look at their asses in those tight pants, but you also could sneak a peek at their [[anal|booty cracks]]. Don't worry if they might get mad, [[Truth|they're asking for it]]
* They make women more slutty, thus increasing chances of getting laid. But seeing as [[You|you're]] reading this article, you most likely won't get any
* They lower [[sperm|fertility rate]] if you're a guy meaning lower chances of knocking up your best friend's [[Loli|middle school sister]]. But seeing as [[you]] wear skinny jeans, you're probably a [[faggot]] into gay [[buttsecks]] 

== Disadvantages ==

[[Image:Man Trying to wearskinnyjeans.jpg|thumb|[[man boobs]] do [[doing it wrong|not make you a woman]].]]

Well, the disadvantages were pretty much stated everywhere in this article. If you actually wasted your life reading all of this article (and let's face it, you probably have nothing better to do other than [[fap]] to [[CP]] pictures on [[4chan]]) then this will pretty much be a summary of what you already read. For those to [[tl;dr|lazy to read]], continue.
* [[Fact|Skinny Jeans are gay]] and will make you look like a faggot
* [[Fat|Fat women]]
* You won't be able to hide your [[boner]], but seeing as you wear skinny jeans you probably have a [[micropenis|small dick]] or none at all
* You won't be able to fit in your jizz stained boxers meaning your pants will be filled with shit and jizz stains
* Tight pants make [[vaginas]] smell like [[Do not want|shit and fish]]
* [[Gay|They're gay]]
* They might rip when you bend down
* They'll burn your testicals when trying to run in them provided if you even can run in them
* They will cut your blood circulation
* They take forever trying to get them on and dry cleaning can shrink them making the already tiny pants smaller
* [[Gay|They're gay]]
* You can't really fit anything into your pockets
* They're gay

== How to Troll People wearing Skinny Jeans ==
[[Image:Real guys wear skinny jeans tshirt.jpg|thumb|[[HA HA HA, OH WOW]]]]
Evidently, trolling people who wear skinny jeans isn't really that difficult at all. It's actually fairly easy and can cause delicious drama if [[Doing it right|done right]]. Although detecting people wearing skinny jeans on [[teh internets]] is not as easy as it is [[IRL]], it shouldn't be too hard. If the person you want to troll is either a hipster, emo, scene kid, skater, gay, [[GOTIS|a woman]], or all of the above then they automatically wear skinny jeans. Trolling can be done both IRL and on the internet. ''*Needs moar*''
* Tell them how they must have small dicks to be able to wear those
** If female, call them whores for wanting to show off their ass
* If they aren't one already, call them a hipster/emo
* Tell them it makes them look gay
* Brag about how comfortable you normal/baggy jeans are
* If its a [[slut|girl]], stare at their ass all day. If she gets mad and asks why, tell her because she's wearing skinny jeans. If she replies [[Unrealistic Expectations|she's not a whore and isn't like that]], then she's lying.
