Otherwise known as ''[[IRL]]'', '''''Existence''''' is a very popular [[MMORPG]], created by [[Raptor Jesus]] or the [[Gay|Flying Spaghetti Monster]] so he can laugh at how much humanity sucks. ''Existence'' or ''RL'' currently has approximately 6.6 billion subscribers, and that number grows daily, due to people's [[China|inability to properly use a condom]], and in spite of [[BitingBeaver|mothers wanting to kill their children with rusty hangers]]. 

The mood of ''Existence'' can vary greatly - from [[anger]] and [[depression]] to being [[fag|gay]]. The [[rules]] of ''Existence'' are pretty simple; there is no stopping in [[Bat Country]], and [[niggers]] have to ride in the back of the bus.

== Reviews of Existence ==
"A Game like None before!" - ''PCWorld''

"If I'm not on the Internet, I always play this game." - MG

"Coffee making has never been so exciting!" - Playstation

"Once I started to play, I couldn't stop any more!" - The Pizza Guy

"I don't get it! How does it work?" - ''World of Warcraft'' player

== Getting Started ==

Once you buy the game for Gaystation, you must register on the ''Existence'' servers for proper gaming. This can be only done by invite of minimum two other players, or by accident. Loading the game may take 9 months, be sure to find [[Maplestory|something to do instead]].

== Storyplay ==

You start out as an "Infant", a malformed, parasitic species of "Human" and have to try to survive the following years. Game hours equal real hours. You get only one life and no option to start again, unless you buy the extension ''Real Life - Reincarnation!''.  However, this option is incompatible with several religions, one of which you must choose some time in the early levels of the game. You have to learn to use various instruments during your life, including sex toys, heavy machinery, and [[LiveJournal]]. Several seemingly unimportant ingame information ("school") can be of great help in the upper levels of the game. 

The storyline is individualized and told from a first person perspective. There are billions of possible endings, depending of your choices in the game. What makes this game awesome, is that there are external objects that may change the course of the story, like [[AIDS|permanent status ailments]] or [[Cooldude|high leveled individuals]]. [[Winnar|Some people manage to adapt]], [[Tourneyfag|others don't]].

== Features ==

Having completed the lower levels, you get access to unlimited features. Virtually anything can be integrated in ''Real Life''. A pencil, for example, makes lines on paper. A bomb rearranges the setting. ''Real Life'' is not only a simulation, MMORPG and adventure game, but also the biggest online chat in existence and dating-site. No NPCs (except for Fundies)!

There is a wide selection of familiars to combat your main enemy: Loneliness.  These include [[friends]], [[Buy a dog|pets]], and family members. However, you must increase your Social Adaptation skill first in order to have familiars available.<br>

== SPOILERS ==

=== SPOILER About Existence ===

Everything you've ever been told about existence is a lie. You have no destiny. [[Mudkipz|God]] has no place for you. Living a [[Nice guy|virtuous life]] only gets you laughed at. When you die, there is no endless green meadow, instead you get sent to Hell, to have your brain swallowed by [[Cthulhu]]. You know [[cooldude|that guy who beat you up in the 8th grade]]? He is not going to be punished in the next life, regardless of how much you cry yourself to sleep over it.
