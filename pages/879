'''Battlefield: Bad Company 2''', also known as '''Battlefailed: Run Around and Get Sniped Company 2''' is a [[lie|tactical]] FPS released by [[Electronic Arts|EA]] [[Sweden|DICE]] in March [[2010]] as a big "Fuck You!" to [[Modern Warfare 2]]. Though it does have a single player mode, the main reason anyone gets Bad Company 2 is to go online and [[troll]] the fuck out of the opposing team. Or [[Griefing|your own team]]. It doesn't really matter. It is available for [[PC]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PS3]]. [[Irony|It is a pretty cool vidya game released this console generation, and generally anyone who tells you otherwise is a 13 year old Modern warfag trying to defend their game with the rabid tenacity of a 16 year old girl trying to defend the literary qualities of Twilight]]. Unlike Modern Warfare 2, Bad Company 2 was given dedicated servers which are likely to either crash for hours, lag the fuck out of you with random ping spikes, and worst of all giving you the pleasure of experiencing the worst hitboxes in gaming, because the game compensates for 100 milliseconds of latency, calculated by its [[aspies|speshul]] system. 
It's easily fixed by an .ini edit, set the ping to the ping you see in the browser, which is usually less than half the latency.(but who gives a shit) Every soldier also has [[tourettes guy|tourettes syndrome]] as he uncontrollably yells "EAT THIS MOTHERFUCKER" every time he sees an opponent. (You can't hear your own character yelling this,but your enemies can)
==Story==
{{Spoilers|Aguire is Wyatt's son!}}

[[Image:Battlefield-bad-company-2-screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Bad Company 2]]

While most people don't notice because they are too busy playing conquest mode online, the game does in fact, have a story behind it. It's 3 minutes and 20 seconds into the [[future]], and [[Russia]] is [[pwn]]ing the shit out of [[Europe]], [[South America]], [[Alaska]], and [[shit nobody cares about|Canada]], and is knocking on [[America]]'s door (since fiction is the only place where that would be possible). The game never really says why, though it's presumably because [[Bad Vlad]] got bored with raping and pillaging [[South_Ossetia|lesser nations]].

The single-player game itself focuses on your squad, which is made up of a black person who is constantly 2 weeks from retirement, a [[CSIII|CSIII graduate]] who is also the token Jew, a [[redneck]], and [[you]], and your attempts to find some kind of [[WWII]]-era [[Japan]]ese Death Star. The plot is not so much a moving Shakespearean epic as it is a thinly-veiled excuse to have the player going around the world, busting into people's living rooms, putting 5.56 millimeters of [[lead]] into all of the occupants, and also blowing the shit out of South America. It also trolls [[Modern Warfare 2]]'s shitty-ass story every chance it gets, which is always a plus. [[Lie|The idea of fighting Russians has never ever been done before]].

TL;DR: A half-assed attempt to create a story was made, but feel on its face like a fat kid doing high jump.

==Multiplayer==

{{Spoilers|HOLY SHIT ALL WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT ARE BALANCED NOW! TOOK THEM 5 FUCKING MONTHS!!}}

Bad Company 2's multiplayer can best be described as a fantastically-designed [[troll]]ing engine. Every class is overpowered. Every vehicle is overpowered. Every weapon can be fitted with a sniper-scope and Magnum ammo. Death Cams let you ghost enemy player's positions to your squad. The [[WWII]] pistol can snipe enemies across the map. The Q/Select/Back-button called the "Socialize Command" activates a legitimate wall-hack. There is literally no end to the ways to can ruin kids' days online. Unlike Modern Warfare 2, this game is actually not [[lie|broken]] and [[lolwut|the average player IQ is actually above 70 (give or take)]]. Players will often do two things: camp, or use vehicles. And if you  thought [[Modern Warfare 2]] was bad for camping, wait till you play this piece of shit. Playing Bad Company 2 feels like taking a meat cleaver, cutting 90 or more notches in every part of the body, and taking a bath in saltwater, getting out of the bath, and being lit on fire. The Hit Detection is painful, the amount of asshole shit one can do is insane, the shotgun range was programmed by a crack addict. 

Your typical match tends to go as follows:

1) Spawn in, run 5 miles to your objective. Get sniped.
2) Spawn in on a teammate. Die two seconds later.
3) Spawn in at base. Get sniped from across the map.
4) Spawn near enemy camping spot. Try to plant C4 on the building in question. Get sniped as you finish setting your charges.
5) Spawn in, get run over by a tank. 
6) REVIVED!!! Die two seconds later from a sniper.
7) Rage quit.
8) Get sniped after rage quitting.
9) Turn [[Xbox 360|360]] off. Get sniped [[not funny|again]].

'''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0t_507eWn4 A short instructional video for noobs ]'''
===Rush===

This mode will put your squad's teamwork to the test... which they will <s>most likely</s> [[Robot Unicorn Attack|ALLWAYS]] [[fail]]. The objective of Rush is to <s>fill enemy crates with [[DragonForce]] cd's until they [[asplode]], without the enemy noticing you</s> NOBODY ACTUALLY DOES THAT. When you must defend these crates, and the enemy is activating them, your teammates will most likely stand as far from them as possible, [[Protip|shooting at it until it dies]], because they are afraid disarming the crates might ruin their [[Gay|perfect]] kill/death ratio.

The people you find playing Rush are generally really gay, love cock and have absolutely no idea what team work is.

Rush is played with explosives, and not the manly kind that require you to arm it then defend like a squad until it blows (giggity) no, instead the acceptable action is to either relentlessly spam rockets at it from 2 bases away,tank snipe it, or plant C4 all over an ATV/Blackhawk and Jihad the fuck out of the MCOM. Gayest tactic evar as it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to stop the enemy team from teleporting to your MCOM and shitting out a dozen brix of C4, causing MCOM insta-death. Avoid Rush mode like the plague. Play Conquest like a real man and get spawn camped like the rest of us. 

HOWEVER, in a recent patch C4 is no longer as effective against M-Coms. Not like it matters because fuckers will still try. 

===Conquest===
This mode is played by capturing a series of flags so the rest of your team can spawn on those flags, and then pushing the other team into their main spawn and pounding them into the dirt the moment their sorry asses hit "spawn now." Or, on [[Gay|Atacama Desert]], players will [[whore]] the helicopters and [[Rape|blow your ass up]]. However, chopper whores end up losing because they forgot to capture the flags because they are [[stupid]]. 

If the opposing team is [[never|actually a threat]] and gives you a [[annoying|challenge]], you will spend the entire game running around the god-damned map capturing bases because the moment you capture one you'll [[Nigger stole my bike|lose another]]. Because the opposing team is doing [[clone|the same damned thing]]. <s>Which is actually really fun.</s> [[DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS|No it's not, shut up]].

===Onslaught===
[[rape|Onslaught]] mode is the biggest ripoff since [[Modern Warfare 2]]'s [[Clit|Stimulus]] [[Sack|Package]]. Onslaught mode is $10, and what do you get for it? A single-flag Rush mode with enemy AI instead of real players. This DLC includes [[Divide by zero|0]] new maps (hell, the file was 100 kb), 0 new weapons, 0 new classes/characters, 0 new vehicles, just an "enhanced"/co-op Squad Rush variant. [[You]]'ll probably get more enjoyment from paying a 75 year old [[pedophile]] to allow him to let you suck him off. 

Remember that if you play this you are always a [[Useless Human|Recon]] and never an Engineer. Ever. NEVER EVER. 

==Why Bad Company 2 is fail==
*<s>No new maps, ever.</s> <s>New maps have been announced.</s> [[DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS]]
*No mod support, at all.(There is one mod currently sold as a game called "Medal of Honor" which steals ideas from Modern Warfare 2)
*Shitty Optimization for the PC
*Unbalanced Recon class hitboxes the size of a turnip
*It was made to compete with MW2, not Battlefield 2.
*Maps are small as hell, except for MW2 fags who promptly complain that they are too big to score [[ninja|knife]] and random grenade kills.
*Only 32 players at most.
*The PC controls are shitty as hell as it is a console port.
*No prone (because when i play games i want to lie down like a lazy shit covered panda bear in both worlds)
*[[lens flare|Bloom]] everywhere, can't see shit.
*Humvees are incredibly useful as [[noob]]-guided, [[terrorism|remotely-detonatable C4 delivery systems]]. They are useless for [[sex|anything else]].
*Like in MW2, [[WTF|Assault rifles are more accurate then Sniper rifles.]]
*COD fags will always bitch that their game is better.

===The Classes===
====Assault====
[[Image:Grenade_Launcher.jpg|thumb|right|Your typical assault player]]
Assault is the most versatile class, and is certainly the easiest to troll with. Every assault rifle comes with a 40MM Grenade launcher (aka <s>N00b t00b</s> Pr0 PiPE), and one of the first unlocks is an infinite-supply of ammo boxes. A common tactic is to camp behind a hill, throw down an ammo crate, and shell an enemy base with infinite grenades. One of the later unlocks is an [[God|An-94]] that, with the right upgrades, can drop people from across the entire fucking map.
=====The Average Assault=====
* Uses nothing but the grenade launcher.
* Complains about the M60.
* Never gives any goddamn ammo! 
* Is deaf.

====Engineer====
[[Image:Bad_Company_2_Dentist.jpg|thumb|right|An engineer performs a routine lobotomy.]]
The anti-vehicle class, and trolls. Engineers can equip rocket launchers, they can and will kill any infantry that gets in its way. Even if they're behind cover, the round can [[Dynamic Entry|punch through walls and kill everyone on the other side]]. [[PROTIP]]: [[win|Equip the PP-2000 and the 4x optical sight]].

=====The Average Engineer=====
* Never repairs friendly vehicles.
* Only uses their rockets against infantry.
* Whores vehicles.
* Is blind.

====Medic====
[[Image:Bad_Company_2_Medic.jpg|thumb|right|[[raptor Jesus|Rambo Jesus]]]]
An unholy combination of [[Rambo]] and [[Jesus]]. Medics get healing kits, defibrillators, and the M60 Light Machine Gun, meaning that they essentially glide across the battlefield healing and resurrecting their teammates, while laying down 100 rounds of fully-automatic rape. To hit a really high note on the lulz-o-meter, defibrillate an enemy - instant kill. It's not uncommon to find squads of 4 medics getting 100-0 W/L ratios because of their death machines, and defibrillator circle-jerking. (Usually, the only solution to this [[faggotry]] is [[rape|Carl Gustav]]). You can use other machine guns as a Medic, but since the M60 is the most accurate and powerful gun in the game with the [[Bullshit|largest magazine capacity]], [[noone]] ever does. 
=====The Average Medic=====
* Tortures teammates by reviving them in front of enemies so they die again 1 second later.
* Uses the M60 and claims that the latest patch made it underpowered.
* Complains about players driving vehicles.
* Is dumb.

====Recon====
[[Image:Bad_Company_2_Recon.jpg|thumb|right|[[niggers|You will learn to hate this man.]]]]
The most hated class in the game, mainly because they wouldn't disarm a bomb if it were glued to their legs (not that they would care since then they would finally be able to go prone). It's been estimated that 93.8% of recons on your team do not understand the concept of elevation and wind-age, and a similar percentage does not understand the "spotting" system in Bad Company 2. Every recon on your team couldn't headshot the Statue of Liberty even if they were five feet away from her nose. Every recon on the enemy's team is [[In_Soviet_Russia...|Vasily Zaytsev]]. 
=====The Average Recon=====
* Camps so hard that their ghillie suits grow into the ground.
* Never uses their Motion Mines.
* Provides a valuable service to the team by keeping his unlocked spotting scope pristine in a pretty velvet display case while the enemy is shelling the fuck out of you.
* Is paraplegic.

===The Weapons===

*'''M60 LMG'''
It's the best gun in the game. It's better than any SMG at close range. It is better than any Assault Rifle at medium range, and its better than any sniper rifle at long range. Most importantly it carries 100 bullets and is the most used gun in the game. For K/D ratio whores this gun makes the Assault class obsolete. Add Magnum rounds [[Robot Unicorn Attack|always]].

*'''Knife'''
[[lie|One of the few things DICE took from Call of Duty]] is the insta-kill Combat Knife, because for some reason, every game developer out there thinks a 6-inch blade can do more damage than a rifle bullet punching right through you at very high speeds. Except the knives in this game are actually made up of a portion of Wolverine's adamantium claw or some goofy shit, because they can be used to smash through doors and [[rip and tear]] chainlink fences like a goddamn lightsaber. Also, it takes a whole 2 seconds to actually stab a guy with this weapon. When using this weapon either it will somehow fail miserably by doing absolutely nothing or you will Commando rush through a barrage of enemy bullets and [[Explosm|stab some motherfucker right in the eye]].

<center>'''The knife and it's commando pro Michael Jordan jump ability'''</center>
<center><youtube>xLn59CYE7-I</youtube></center>

*'''40mm Grenade Launcher'''
Since the dawn of time, the N00b t00b AKA the Pro Pipe has been one of the most rage inducing weapons in existence. The assault class normally starts with 2 rounds, meaning they should get at least 2 kills per spawn, assuming they don't suck. When you learn how to read the elevation scope,  those rounds start flying halfway across the map, and if you can find a safe place to throw down an ammo box, you can shoot as long as you want. Later on, you get a bandolier upgrade giving you 4 shots before you have to reload. They can blow away walls, doors, and even armored vehicles if you keep at it. A surefire recipe to make other players [[Rage|RAGE]].

*'''Neostead 2000'''
This weapon along with all other Pump shotguns in the game are believed to be the biggest waste of tax payers money. However, all other shotguns fire bread crumbs and can't hit shit unless you are right beside the target. This weapon, however, is a goddamn sniper rifle. It can kill from [[over 9000| ovar ninefowsand]] yards away, and will automatically aim for the head. For increased [[drama|drama], equipped magnum and slugs, if your a veteran, which turns the gun into a handheld mortar strike. Have fun sniping snipers at 300 meters away with your pump action shotgun. (lulz can be increased by being a SPECACT medic while doing this.)

*'''Saiga 20K'''
A semiautomatic shotgun. Absorb that idea. It is one of the family of weapons that can be equipped by any class. Meaning you can get motion-sensored by a recon, then shot in the back. You can face an autohealing/rezzing medic, who will then shoot you in the face. You can face an assault who has infinite ammo for his shotgun, and will spray it around like [[Michael J. Fox]] at a urinal. And finally you can face an engineer, who if he misses, will just pull out a rocket launcher and blow you away. You can also use the USAS-12 which is practically identical to the Saiga except it reloads slightly slower, however with it you can just hold down the trigger and start screaming.

*'''Carl Gustav'''
Rape incarnate, engineers will pack this with an extended rocket ammo and extra explosive damage, meaning they will have <s>6</s> 8 rockets to blast into you. If you take cover you will die. If you run you will die. If you try to kill the engineer you will die. If you do anything else you will die. They also work with tracers, and although they aren't tankpwn, say goodnight if you are in a jeep or a chopper. One day [[EA]] decided that the M60 was overpowered and [[Lie|reduced its damage, turning it into a normal weapon.]] That day the CG became the most fucking overused weapon in the game (except for the 40mm <s>n00b t00b</s> PR0 PIPE), making engineers the strongest and the gayest class in the game for a while (until everyone found out that EA are [[Troll|trollin']] and the M60 is still the strongest weapon in the game).

*'''M136 AT4'''
The "best" anti tank rocket in the game. Most players are too dumb to realize how it works. Unlike what the game tells you IT IS NOT HEAT [[SEAKING]]. When you aim with it you will see a bright red box. Point that to what you want to hit. Now this weapon probably has the biggest amount of retarded limitations of any gun in the game. If you get killed while its in midair it will vanish  one second later. If you change weapons after shooting it, it will keep going straight however after flying for over one second, but after one second it will wait until its one meter from reaching an enemy vehicle it swerve at a 120° angle towards the sky. While you have the weapon equipped even if you aren't aim down sight it will still follow where you are looking. Basically forcing you to stand out in the open like a fucking whack-a-mole aiming for the vehicle you trying to hit.

*'''Tracer Darts'''
Tracer Darts are the most decorative weapon ever to be invented; they hiss out a large blinking red dot that sticks to people and vehicles. It is a great device for communicating messages to your team mates like "give me some medicine/ammo you fucking homosexual", or "move out of the fucking way" or, "please stop fail-sniping AND MOVE". Normally they are supposed to be attached to vehicles, which then attract rockets if your team nates have trouble hitting a 10 foot wide vehicle. However, they can also be put onto people, and any hit of an enemy with it will give you 30 points (a kill gives you 50 points). Go assault, toss down an ammo crate, AND START DECORATING! Useless Snipers + Tracer Dot to the face = Win.

*'''M1911'''
An antique from World War 2, yet somehow surpasses almost every fucking "Modern" pistol by far in terms of power. Combine with Magnum Ammo to create a single-handed shotgun and a drop-less sniper rifle.

*'''M9 and M93R'''
The joke weapons of the game. The <s>M9's stats are identical to the MP-443</s> (the M9 is actually more powerful than the Grach, but still) however is shoots 28% slower and carries five less shots. With the M93R you won't be able to hit the broad side a tank if it were parked 10 meters from you if you life depended on it.

*'''AN-94'''
A 2-shot burst Assault Rifle. Considered to be the best assault rifle in the game because it does the most damage and is very accurate. However it required the user to click fast and have to deal with [[opinion|one of the worst iron sights]] in the game unless they use one of the iron sight replacement specializations, meaning that this gun is pro shit by default and and it is the eighth deadly sin to even conceive of defiling it's pure rape laser essence by using anything other than a Red Dot Sight or an ACOG on it.

*'''XM8 Series'''
Every class has one. Except the Recons but they don't do anything anyways. These guns are practically Bad Company 2's signature guns. They're win in singleplayer, but in multiplayer (AKA The Real Game) they all suck the gay right out of Liberace's anus except for the assault version, which will slap your shit all day, everyday, and make you like it.

*'''VSS'''
A [[lie|sniper rifle]] that only comes with 40 bullets. Expect every jackass who uses this thing to act like they're an assault class.  Be sure to combine it with Magnum ammo to drop a guy in 4 shots. ALWAYS choose the extra ammo perk it because eats more ammo than Paris Hilton eats cock. Unlike other smgs,it doesn't come with crosshairs.

*'''Humvee'''
Now you too can be like the guys fighting in Afghanistan. The Humvee, with its cardboard armor, makes a very large target that can be 1-shotted by tanks and RPGs while its crew can be shot out of the vehicle by machine guns. Unlike in Battlefield 2, the gunner must keep his torso OUTSIDE the vehicle where he can be sniped out. The only redeeming factor is that it's faster than the quad.

*'''Abrams/T-90'''

The most whored vehicles in the game. Most drivers tend to drive ''away'' from friendly engineers when low on health.

*'''UH-60 Blackhawk'''

A shitty helicopter used only as a mobile spawn point. It is armed with 2 worthless miniguns that cant hit a guy even if he stands still 30 feet away. It also leaves the crew members vulnerable to snipers. Be prepared to jump out as noob pilots tend to crash the helicopter 7 seconds after takeoff. Trolling can be done by flying off the map.

Its Russian counterpart, the Hind, is even [[moar|more]] retarded.

*'''Apache/Havoc'''

The best vehicles in the game. There is no way to counter these with anything other than an AA gun or another helicopter. <s>The tracer darts are pretty useless against this aircraft.</s>

*'''UAV'''

[[lie|An idea stolen from Modern Warfare 2.]] It is armed with a laser designator and optional machine guns. Trolling the other team can be done by loading it up with c4 and flying into their mcom station.

===Trolling for Dummies===
The following is a list of ways and techniques you can piss off your fellow BC2 players.

* Play squad deathmatch online at about 5pm EST. Wear a mike. The game will be full, and assorted [[your mom|mothers]] will start screaming that [[chikins|dinner]] is ready. [[lulz|Hilarity]] is like [[nerd rage|taking candy from a baby]] at this point.

* Place mines in front of unoccupied vehicles, get in, park over them, and get out. Wait in a bush and wait for ensuing [[lulz]].

* In Arica Harbour, [[noob|recons]] like to think they are re-inventing the wheel by jumping from that rock onto the top of that tree at the far end of the map. Patience, young grasshopper; after he gets a kill or 2, some friends will join the party. Carl Gustav the neck of whoever is in the middle. [[RAGE|RRRAAAAAAAGGGGEEEEEE!!!11one11!]]

* Throw 2 or 3 bricks of C4 on a quad or a Hummer, and go Jihad on someone's ass.

* If a member of your squad has been camping the same hill for 10 minutes with only 2 kills to show for it, shoot him in the face with a tracer. Anyone with a decent TV will see him as rudolph's nose, and he will see nothing but a giant red flashing light... <s>until he dies and re-spawns</s> has a time limit... unfortunately. No tracer? No worries; just equip your biggest/loudest gun, stand on his back, and empty all of your cartridges as quickly as possible aiming at everything and nothing. He will cry like a bairn for revealing his ZOMG SEKRIT!!!11one1! hiding place, and every enemy on the map will fall over themselves to spam grenades, RPGs, and lazors at the rukus. 

* If you're playing Rush on any map where the objective is in a destructible building, go assault, equip a shotgun, extra explosive ammo, and extra explosive damage. Then throw down an ammo box, and <s> wire the whole building with 6 C4 charges and blow it up. If done correctly the building will collapse after doing this two times.</s> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]. Srsly, take example from [http://anonym.to/?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4gSgLV-LXE this].

* If you're a defender in Rush, go Recon, call a mortar strike on the enemy base, suicide, and repeat. Respawning is 4x faster than waiting for the cooldown to finish, and defenders get infinite respawns.

* Tracer tag friendly vehicles. To make them shiny.

* If you see an engineer leave his tank to repair it... Steal it! Or even better, attach several [[shit bricks|bricks]] of C4 to the opposite side, and detonate only after it has been fully repaired and the engineer is back in. If its a teammate blow it up before he get back in. Bonus points if it's a teammate. 

* If you ever see a squad of just recon players camping the same spot, go assault and spam 40MM smoke grenades.

* When piloting a fully-loaded Black-hawk, leave the map.

* Hit a friendly Black-hawk in the tail with the Carl Gustav. Though you can't kill it, the physics engine will make it take a nose-dive and crash. Call the pilot a noob.

* C4 a chopper or a tank, and leave it in enemy territory.

* Use the repair tool to get a head-shot.

* Use the 40mm smoke grenades to get a kill.

* Grenade occupied sniper towers.

* Get two engineers to ride on the side seats on the black-hawk, and have them use the repair drill while riding in it. Especially effective on Isla Innocentes.

* Shotgun slugs aren't affected by bullet drop. Snipe with them.

* Additionally, on hardcore, shotguns are the only guns to keep their crosshair. Seriously, snipe with them.

* Form a squad of 4 M60 Medics on a map with no vehicles.

* <s>Be low on ammo and look at someone with an Assault kit, and spam the spot button.</s> Doesn't work. All assault players are deaf.

* Equip the Vehicle Alt Weapon perk, and go on strafing runs in the UAV.

* This one requires some teamwork. Place 6-18 bricks of c4 on an accomplice's UAV. Have them proceed to fly up to the fully loaded Blackhawk or M-Com of their choosing. Detonate.

* Run a friendly or enemy helicopter into the ground with the UAV.

* Be a recon and brag on your mike about your perfect sniping spot on top of a building. Once 10 other snipers arrive C4 the building and let Destruction 2.0 do the rest.

* Shoot a teammate's AT mines and C4 when they lay it, causing it to explode and make them commit suicide

*Equip the SSprn-2 (Faster sprint) and Sarm-2 (increased infantry armor) specs and run around knifing like a motherfucker. Guaranteed to cause lulz as fags will stare in disbelief as you absorb their bullets like a fucking sponge and just keep running.

*Attach C4 to a Quad or Hummer. Drive towards enemy base. Jump out, and it'll keep going. Blow that motherfucker up when it's next to a tank. Alternative: Park it next to the enemy tank spawn. Alternative Alternative: Shoot someone who's doing this, the explosion's going to be [[Unfunny|XBOX HUEG!!!]]

*Destroy enemy tanks at the spawn, remembering where the exact point is. Plant C4 underneath them. Hide. Wait for tanks to respawn. Wait for someone to get in them. Win.

*See that douchebag in the sniper tower who isn't getting any kills? Plant C4 on at least three of the legs. Detonate that shit. Instant Team Kill, even outside of hardcore.

*Place all your C4 on the ground (preferably in a shallow river or bridge) and stand in the middle of the road on the other side of the C4, wait for a vehicle to come towards you and just before they get to you detonate. Guaranteed lulz.

*On the map "Oasis", chopper whores like to camp the helipad for their [[rape]] machine, Park a tank on the helipad. (It won't spawn if the spawn area is occupied), then just sit back and watch the hate mail pour in. Guaranteed [[lulz]]

*Alternatively, take the chopper, equip Vsmoke (For the tracers) and go on strafing runs with it.  Be sure to memorize the AA gun locations so they have nothing to defend themselves with.  Whenever you receive hatemail for this fairly cynical maneuver, be sure to claim that it's perfectly balanced.

*Alternatively Alternatively, take the chopper, and sit in spawn. Giggle like a [[13 year old boy]] as your [[butthurt]] teammates spam lazors, sperm wads and [[9/11| world trade centers]] at your shiny new chopper. Bonus points if you flip it 5 seconds after lifting off.

*Play assault, equip the AN-94 with a 4x scope and magnum ammo, then just camp back and snipe people with your now assault rifle turned sniper. Did you run out of ammo? No worries!  you're an assault, you have plenty!  This combination has been known to cause epic amounts of [[butthurt]].

*Play hardcore as a medic, defibrillate a team mate, revive him.  Rinse and repeat.

*Equip an all kits weapon on the assault class (G3, M14, M1, Thompson) Then mosey on over to the enemy base, plant C4 on all the enemy vehicles, wait for them to all fill up. [[Profit]]

*Go assault with C4 again, this time on a map with the blackhawk. (Isla innocentes, Valpraiso, Heavy Metal, Port Valdez) Sneak into the enemy base, plant C4 on the blackhawk, hide in the nearest bush, wait for the idiots to pile into it, let it fly over to the friendly base, and once you hear it start shooting, [[Michael Bay | BLOW IT!!!!!!!!]]

*Play hardcore, run over your team mates. (Do you really need a tutorial?)

*Get a roadkill with the UAV

*Bad Company 2 Vietnam:  Do the boat glitch, it allows you to get under the map where you're virtually invincible, and allows you to light up every poor motherfucker on the map because the geniuses at Dice thought it would be a good idea to half-ass the maps and not put in collision barriers to prevent this.  here's an [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCyeGJXlSk example]

==Vietnam==
Currently being sold in Pre-Alpha stages.
Every map has one side that will win 90% of the time.
Hitbox detection is far worse than the original game.

It is quite historically [[Vietnam|accurate]] as you just run around and die for no apparent reason at all.

If you thought the maps were small before you will [[Shit Bricks|shit brix]] when you realize in Vietnam you literally spawn within feet of each others bases ensuing a huge [[Clusterfuck|clusterfuck]] of arty and grenade spam.

This expansion adds only a few guns, two of which are extremely over powered the Flamethrower and Battlefield's version of the [[Counter-Strike|AWP]] the m40.
In the end Vietnam is a shitty map pack for 15$ bucks, sound [[Modern Warfare 2|familiar?]]
