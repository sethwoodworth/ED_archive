RDK
'''Red Darkstar [[Kirby]]''', or more commonly referred to as '''RDK''' (which also stands for Really Dirty Jew), is a leet [[Super Smash Brothers]] player from everyone's favorite [[tourneyfag]] site, Smashboards.  Even among the [[1337|elitist]] tourneyfags of Smashboards, he declares himself elite.  In fact, he's such a [[fail|leet]] player, that he decided to shout this proclamation to the rest of the tourneyfag community by making his own [[shit]]ty Smashboards knockoff using the wonders of Invisionfree forums.

RDK is not only a [[cock]]y bastard who thinks he is good at debating and video [[game]]s, but he is also the main [[admin]] of the "[[fail|elite]]" Smashboards spinoff called Play 2 Win.  His trademarks include using [[fail|petty]] insults and [[Bible|logical fallacies]] in his arguments, posting in [[Kaliph Jamal|bright red fruity font]], using a clever [[House]] avatar, and being a general douche to people. RDK also enjoys [[fellatio|sucking]] the lifeless birth defected cock of his fellow Gay 2 Win member [[Dylan_Tnga]].

[[IRL]], RDK is a [[Michael Jackson|ridiculous excuse for a human being]]. His self proclamation of his status of being part of the "[[tourneyfag|higher smash community]]" on SmashBoards just proves how much of a [[shit|great contribution]] to life he [[srsly]] is. Probably beaten and sexually abused by his drunken step-father, RDK takes out his anger by verbally assaulting people with his ridiculously biased opinions and [[fail|insightful]] commentary. [[lie|Contrary to popular belief, RDK does not care what people on the internet think about him]]. Even though 99% of the people on SmashBoards, which is [[over 9000]] people, thinks his life is a complete waste of shit. Still, the [[faggots|1% that can stand him]] enjoys reinforcing his biased opinions by giving him [[fail|support]] when he attempts to win an argument. They still ultimately fail because they are [[arguing on the internet]].

RDK's underlings are <s>almost</s> as bad as he is.  Chief of these is the infamous Del [[Money]] from Smashboards.  Del is generally [[Dianne Thorley|unknown to the rest of the e-populace]], but to the Smashboards-goers, he is known to be a shitty poster with ridiculously LULZ-worthy grammar, and a [[goatse|general asshole]].  Del Money also spends his time trying to be sneaky by blatantly editing articles in sad attempts to make 4chan butthurt.  However, he proves his intelligence by making these edits under the shrewd name codename BigDee.  LULZ.

Note: RDK is not actually any good at all at playing Smash. In fact, he never played well in the number of tournaments he went to. That number is probably the number of times you got laid.
