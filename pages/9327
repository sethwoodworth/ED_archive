==The ZX Spectrum==

The spectrum was, is, and will always be the most powerful computer [[evar]]. What made it so good was its total immunity to [[AIDS]], due to the clever rubber keys on the 48K model acting as an anti-virus condom. as a result the interweb was for a time completely AIDS free, so free in fact that blood could be purchased on [[eBay]] from [[Africa]] without giving it a second thought.

Made in [[England]], it soon became one of the UK's largest exports, beaten by only two commercial properties - Pot Noodle and dogging. The Spectrum's only serious competion came from Commodore, however it brought on its own downfall after releasing the system exclusives "Jet Set [[Allah]]" and "[[Suicide]] Bomb Jack II" - as a result their offices and factories were fire-bombed by irate Arab, giving Sinclair the freedom to run the UK/European drug cartel without problems from rival comapanies. At least until they got cocky and fucked everything up.

If the Spectrum was so [[scene|hardcore]], one may wonder why the heavy boys in the IT industry struggle today. This is down to the fact that [[Bill Gates]] failed to steal anything from the Spectrum and instead used his own half-cooked programming to clone it and [[failed]]. This was an issue with all versions of Windows, so in his most recent OS Bill "borrowed" design ideas from [[macintosh]] hoping to gloss over the gaping holes in his code. Unfortunately, as Apple has also found to their cost, this tactic only works on [[emo|shallow assholes]] with [[retard|no understanding of how computers work]].

[[common_sense|ALL]] programmers know that BASIC is [[1337]].
