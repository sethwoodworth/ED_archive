For some sick reason, [[furries]] generally accept their perverted urges to fuck 40 year old [[basement dweller]]s in fox suits; that's an accepted fact. But what do you get when the furry in question doesn't want his [[acne]]-afflicted [[faggot]] [[D&D]] playing friends to know?

==What is a Closet Furry?==
[[Image:KrystalPowerIsYours.png|left|90px]]
A '''closet furry''' is, quite simply, a furfag who is ashamed — and rightly so — of being a sick [[cunt]]. He'll hide in his dark, fecal-smelling basement, fapping to [[Fchan]] and rolling in his own excrement like a common cur. Chances are that they also [[cut]], and are consequently an [[emo]] faggot contemplating their next anthro [[MCR|Waycest]] fanfic.  They will, when accused of being a furry, with all sincerity [[denial|deny]] their [[bestiality|sexuality]] but will promptly download — and fap to — infamous bestiality videos such as [[Mr. Hands]].

If any of these conditions are met, the individual in question is a fucking furfag, and should be [[castrate]]d and skinned alive.
*If their [[dog]]/[[cat]]/[[plushie]]/[[mudkip]] has an [[asshole]] the size of a small city
*If they have [[WikiFur]] in their browser history
*If the individual in question has some sort of [[fursuit|unexplainable wardrobe malfunction]]
*If they send you self-contradicting [[MySpace]] messages:

===The Cat Excuse===
A common fursona ploy is using a cat in their name. There, people can say that they're furries to their [[yiff]]-mate(s), but then claim they're just fans of [[lolcat]]s to others. For example, [[Wikipedia:User:SmokeyTheCat|SmokeyTheCat]] on [[TOW]] is known as the biggest [[furfag]] ever. <s>SmokeyTheCat, however, has no relation at all to [[SchmuckyTheCat]], who is not a furry</s>[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|DISREGARD THAT I SUCK FURRY COCKS]]

===The Freudian Slip===
Some closet furries reveal themselves through Freudian slips. [[Blu Aardvark]], for example, had an uncontrollable urge to say his [[fursona]] "aardvark" all the time.
