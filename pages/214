Actor
An [[Liar|actor]] is an individual who [[masturbation|indulges themselves]] in real life imaginary [[drama]]. [[Children]] and [[women]] are often actors [[Almost Raped| when testifying in court]]. [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Mime.jpg Mimes], [[Assclown|clowns]] and [[Andy Dick|improvisers]] do not consider themselves actors. When you watch a performance from any of them, you will agree. There are three main types of [[professional]] actors:

== Theatre Actors ==

An actor who specializes in theatre can usually be identified by a [[Fag|lisp, flamboyant dress, inability to sit down]], and [[Goatse|a distended and/or prolapsed asshole]]. Typically stuck in the nineteenth century, they tend to be [[n00b]]s at [[teh]] [[internets]], and [[fail]] repeatedly.
Theatre involves the live performance on a stage. Considered [[Old media]] due to its content, which, among other things, lacks [[boob shots]] most of the time. Unlike all other advances in civilization, which were performed with the sole intent of [[Heterosexual|impressing the opposite sex]], theatre exists only to impress the [[Homosexual|same sex]].

== Film Actors ==

Typically [[rich and beautiful]], actors whose work appears on [[Movies| the silver screen]] are slightly less likely to appear on one's [[gaydar]] than theatre actors, however, this is still dramatically more than the general population. The overwhelming majority of film actors are shitty at best. A stellar example is [[Tom Cruise]], noted '''[[Scientology|SCIENTOLOGIST]]''' and whose pronouncements on psychiatry and mental health truly are an inspiration to the masses. Film stars typically possess large [[boobs|tits]], or in the case of male film stars, pectoral implants.

== [[Porn]] "Stars" ==

This category of actors probably constitutes the bulk of them. Porn stars are [[Roleplay|people who pretend]] to enjoy getting naked, masturbating or having [[sex]] on film [[Prostitute| in return for some form of compensation]]. Since [[women]] do not typically enjoy [[Boring|consensual]] sex with men -[[your mom]] is an exception- many porn stars, as well as wives and [[girlfriend]]s, are actors. Those who star in [[snuff]], [[gay]] and [[rape]] porn are not -strictly speaking- actors, because they don't have to fake anything. If someone has been in a movie with a sequel number greater than 10, they qualify to be called a porn "star". [[Paris Hilton|People who honestly enjoy having consensual sex on film]] are called "[[Amateur|amatuers]]".

==Tips==

*[[Protip]]: Calling a [[politician]] an actor is good [[trolling|flame bait]] when in the company of actors; it is tantamount to saying that a black person is human being at the weekly [[Ku Klux Klan]] meeting.
*Acting is [[serious buisness]], if you excel at whoring yourself, you might get an award. [http://dnbforum.com/showthread.php?70396-Dirtiest-Girl-in-Porn-Award]
