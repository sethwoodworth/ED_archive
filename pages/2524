EA
'''Electronic Assholes''' is a half-ass video game company aimed at [[zerg rush|Zerg rushing]] [[rape|motherfucking games]] to [[retards]]  Founded in 1982 by Trip "On Acid" Hopkins, [[Ass Rape|ass raping the shit out of games through history]], most notably ''black person'', ''[[furry|Catwoman]]'', and ''[[DOUBLE NIGGER|Def Jam: Vendetta]]''. EA is like [[Scientology]] for games. EA IS THE CANCER KILLING VIDEO GAMES.

==Sales Strategy==
Currently, Electronic Arts has become one of the [[fat|fattest]] in the industry, primarily by ass-raping and [[OM NOM NOM NOM|eating companies such as BioWare, Westwood, Bullfrog and Pandemic Studios]], and then [[Ebaumsworld|shit staining them with the EA brand.]]  [[Image:Electronic_Arts_historical_logo.png|thumb|Wow! we can draw shapes! This was the result of one of their failed games]]  However, Electronic Arts has made a name for itself in the "re-releasing the same game every fucking year and still getting [[retards|people]] to buy it" market as well, so that when there are no fucktards left, <s>Larry Probst</s> <s>John Riccitiello</s> the Fucktard CEO can still wipe his ass with 100 dollar bills. Popular cashcows include:
*'' Call of Duty: Battlefield
*''[[Football|Madden '##]]''
*''Tiger Woods' Pro Golf ##''
*''NBA Live '##''
*''FIFA '##''
*''NHL '08''
*''Jamaican Bobsled Team '##''
*''Nascar '##''
*''Arena Football'##''
*''Rushed unfinished glitchy mess '##''
*''Cricket '##''
*''[[basement dweller|Basement Dweller '08 out of 10,000]]''
*''MVP Baseball '08''
*''MVP NCAA Baseball '08''
*''Same Game as last year, except with slightly different roster '##''
*''NCAA Football '08''
*''NCAA March Madness '08''
*''The Sims'' series with [[at least 100]] new expansion packs every month.
*''<s>Canceled sequel to a game people actually did want released</s>'' - LOL CANCELED!
*''[[Furry]] Hunters '08''
*''[[Over 9000|Power Level 9,000]]''
*''Command & Con[[Gay|queer]]''
*''The adventures of a [[Azn|Chinky]] chick who jumps around on rooftops''
*''Big name "Flavor of the month" movie/TV license''
You get the idea.

==Employment==
Electronic Arts is notorious for providing their employees with the most comfortable sweatshop jobs in [[India]].  For <s>designing</s> glitching and fucking up [[over 9000|a minimum of 9,000 games]] a year, the average employee is a lazy beaner which is awarded with a nearly infinite amount of [[Neopets|Neopoints]], daily [[fried chicken]], and nightly [[rape|sex]] with [[cockmongler|an attractive customer service representative.]]

==NCAA Football Bullshit==
Back in ''NCAA Football '06'' for [[Xbox]] EA actually had fucking tight features, but when the game got released for the 360 they took all of the features out and reverted to FUCKING ''NCAA 01''', now they are slowly adding the features back and people buy the game. Pretty smart fucking plan!
The perfect NCAA Football game (will never happen):
*Steroids
*Drunk college girls
*Bribing nigger recruits
*Beer pong
*[[KKK|WHITE POWER PARADES]] (nobody FUCKING LISTENS)
