Flower
[[File:Longrat - flower.jpg|thumb|Flower]]
'''Flower the Meerkat''' is the star of - well, actually, ''was'' the star of - a show called ''Meerkat Manor'', a very educational show with [[at least 100]] [[Furry|fans]].

[[Last Thursday]], bricks were shat and Flower died after getting owned on the face by a cobra with [[AIDS]]. [[Furfags|Fans of the show]] became [[butthurt]] over this, and [[YouTube]] exploded with [[over 9,000]] videos tributes of her. Even more lol-inducing, [[lolcow]] conspiracy theorists claim that the [[what|camera crew filming the show had actually been at the place when Flower got bitten and watched as she died]]. They also claim that they ensured Flower's death for some bullshit about advancing the drama in the show and other things no one cares about. In reality, the show is filmed by placing special recording cameras in the desert and the camera crew only comes around to pick up the film. A more likely idea is that by the time the Flower [[shit]]storm happened, that meerkat was '''[[pwned|already fucking dead]]'''. Of course, the fans failed to realize this and continued on with their videos anyway:

[[Shit nobody cares about|Flower's death has had a pretty dramatic impact on the gang. Rocket Dog has taken her place as the new leader of the Whiskers. Meanwhile, Flower's mate, "Zaphod" grieved for about 5 minutes before ditching the gang in search of some hot meerkat action. Nice.]]

==Steps to troll the fans==
[[Image:Butthurt_meerfag.PNG|thumb|right|Trolling meerkat fans is a piece of cake. They're among the most butthurt in the furry community]]
#Remind the fans that Flower is "just a rat".
#[[Impossible|Tell them to get lives.]]
#Lol at the fact that she got OWNED by that cobra.
#Tell them that [[truth|no one gives a shit]].

#[[PROFIT!]]

==Lulz-Worthy Quotes==
Pulled from the comments of many JewTube videos, this is some lulz-worthy shit. Seriously, do make sure you're alone, or else people will look at you funny if you [[LOL|laugh out loud]] and think you're [[gay]].

{{quote|I finally got a response from the German Animal Planet Team after waiting for a reply for about a month. They've talked to the production team as well. Flower's dead. I hope you bastards enjoyed pointing the camera at Flower while she was dying! F*** you!|[[Atimon]], in the midst of living vicariously through a similar TV show.}}

==Not quite a LiveJournal tribute, but....==
Link to the official obituary--the following version has been slightly edited for [[I_did_it_for_the_lulz|maximum lulz.]]:
Flower, star of Animal Planet's popular series, ''Meerkat Manor'', is survived by loving mate Zaphod and many children including Mozart, Mitch, Buster, Suggs and Izzy. Flower leaves behind a devastated meerkat mob now without its fearless leader. From humble beginnings, she created one of the largest, most close-knit families on the Manor. Affectionately referred to as the "Kalahari Desert Rose" by those who knew her best, she was a [[Bitch|formidable leader]] and a noble mother.
