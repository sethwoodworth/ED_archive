Raziel
{{potential}}


Raziel is a [[fucktard|failed troll]], [[LARP#Live-Action_Role-Playing_.28LARP.29|painfully shy virgin]] and a [[Wicca|Harry Potter cosplayer]]. Raziel is [[Ignored|known]] for hosting a [[shitty|little used]] [[Moralfag|Chanology]] [[Online_sex_games|forum]] and generally being [[pussy troll|the worst troll on the Internet]] next to [[Dyaisura]].

TL;DR: After getting into a scuffle with 711chan, Raziel decided to try to get their hosting pulled by emailing the upstream. He screencapped this and bragged about it in his admin forums on Sci-Ex. Classy guy!

This will be [[awesome|good]]. 


==I Cast Magick Missile!==

Raziel is a practicing [[insane|Wiccan]], so he thinks that [[magick]] is real! That's right, our friend Raz has been [[bullshit|casting protection spells]] on [[masturbation|himself]] and [[lie|friends]] to make sure that the [[Scientology|Church of Scientology]] cannot hurt them. Guess they forgot someone, huh?

==Mom, Dad? It's Official... It's Spousal Abuse!==

It's really quite sad. After going through Wesley's email account(s) it became obvious that he spends virtually no time talking to his doting wife. She emails him repeatedly, begging for his attention, but he is entirely too busy being an [[internet tough guy]] to respond to her, often for up to a week at a time. 

{{squote|I actually got up around 9am today. I'm not sure I like writing to the above address. It seems as though I get less mail from this one. You can't blame just your mom and my parents for all this. You've got to take some of the blame. I just realized I couldn't' take it anymore the way things were going before I left. I don't want to do that all over again. 
You have to convince me that you're not the person I left. I'm not ready to commit to anyone until I'm convinced they can take care of themselves without financial help of any kind. Going to pantries, having to be on rental assistance, etc. I want to feel free, safe, loved, cared for, beautiful again. I don't have to do anything I don't want to, such as settle differences with anyone but God. I want someone who will go to church with me regularly. Is mature enough to know when he's wrong, could use some improvement, is concerned about others. He doesn't tell me what I would want to hear (I know you don't), doesn't expect me to make promises I can't keep, and he doesn't make promises he can't keep or promises at all for that matter unless asked to. Someone who doesn't do or say things to get me, and turn around, after we're together, and quit those things. This is all that's been on my mind this whole time. It's hard for me to think about all the good things. Especially the bedtime stories, know what I mean? I keep most of these things to myself, and I'm slowly breaking down inside. Don't think I don't cry about things. I hope you've learned from what a lesson that was. I will never accept having to many people living under the same roof. Just me and my family I helped to start period. I'm sorry I couldn't say much else. I've said to much all ready. I hope I don't get lectured for this. I'm waiting on a sign from God to proceed any further. I hope for the best in all this. I'm praying about it often. Take care Wes. 

Sincerely, 
Kari |Mrs. Raziel}}

{{squote|How come you don't ever have very much to say when you email me? I thoutht (sic) you got my last letter. I'm hardly ever online when you are. Can't you say more than just a sentence or two? It's a waist (sic) if you don't have more to say. Tell me what's on your mind, I know you have something more to say then "Are you on line?" Spill it. I just got through talking to you on the phone, and you know I'm home now. Get back to me, and tell me more about how you're quiting (sic) smoking. Take care Wes.

{{squote|I haven't told you that you've been spelling there wrong and maybe too. " Are you thare (sic)?" See what I mean. I testdrove two vehicles today. A 1990 Oldsmobile Delta 88, and a 1983 Thunderbird. The Olds's (sic) transmission was going out, and the Thunderbird smoked and idled. No luck today.What took you so long to get back to me anyway? The computers on base? I sent my last email around midnight last night, and you're usually up then. Did you get a voice messege (sic)? "Do not disturbe (sic)." 
You must have had your phone turned off snoozing...LOL... Get back to me, take care Wes.

{{squote|Hi sweetheart,
 
What's been going on? I haven't heard from you since the eleventh. I miss you a lot. I took mark to get his check today. It turns out he got a full paycheck. He's keeping some to himself for his rollplaying (sic) on saturday and giving us the rest. I want to know if you got your wooden box in the mail yet. I'd like to know that you are doing okay. I'm sad cause i haven't heard from you :(.
I would love to hear from you on the phone. I love you very much and hope to hear from you very soon. :)
 
Love,

==But What Can I Do?==
If you find it unsettling that a US Army systems administrator is spending his spare time participating (or pretending to) in insurgencies while using .mil computers, then you might want to discuss it with these 2 email addresses (his superior officers will be notified):<br>

bassettr@usfk.korea.army.mil <br>
acert@1stiocmd.army.mil
