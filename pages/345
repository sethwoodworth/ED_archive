'''Alexander Rybak''' is a [[13-year-old boy]] who became every [[Whore|girl's]] wet dream after he won the 2009's [[Eurovision]]. [[B|/b/tards]] from [[Norway]] were overly [[angry|happy]] about it and decided to [[spam]] up /b/ with pictures of Rybak with some [[Shit nobody cares about|random-ass irrelevant text]]. This resulted in one of the biggest [[fail]]s of a [[forced meme]] of all time.

== Lyrics ==
<pre>
Years ago, when i was younger,
I kinda liked a girl I knew.
She was mine, and we were sweethearts.
That was then, but then it's true.

I'm in love with a fairytale,
Even though it hurts.
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind;
I'm already cursed.

Every day, we started fighting;
Every night, we fell in love.
No one else could make me sadder,
But no one else could lift me high above.

I don't know what I was doing,
When suddenly we fell apart.
Nowadays, I cannot find her,
But when I do, we'll get a brand new start.

I'm in love with a fairytale,
Even though it hurts.
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind;
I'm already cursed.

She's a fairytale (Yeaaah!)
Even though it hurts.
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind;
I'm already cursed.
</pre>
