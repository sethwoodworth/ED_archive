Operation Merry Fritzmas
[[Image:Merryfritz.png|frame]]
In late 2010 Anonymous decided that Christmas is the time not just for receiving but for giving as well. One man who has touched all of us, but mainly his own kids and grandkids, is Michael Jackson. But seeing as Jacko is definitely dead, we'd send some letters to some other old age pervert in this case: [[Fritzl | Joseph Fritzl]]. If you are not aware of the joys of Mr Fritzl, we strongly advise you check out the details of this mans achievements in the world and the unjustice of him not being made Head Thetan. WE applaud Mr. Fritzl for his actions in raping his cumdumpster daughter and making sure she stayed in the basement. 

==Operation Details==
Here are some easy steps to follow:
# Buy a Christmas card
# Poorfags are allowed to use notebook paper and crayons
# Write a Christmas message
# Sign and seal it in an envelope
# Address it to:<br>Justizanstalt Stein<br>Z.H. Josef Fritzl<br> Steiner Landstr. 4 <br>3500 KREMS<br> AUSTRIA
# ???
# FRITZMAS CHEER!

Bonus points maybe obtained by:
* making your own card
* sending him a gift along with the card
* donating to a children's charity in his name
* adopting a child in his name
* adopting anything in his name
* using Moonpig to send him a custom card
* getting a reply back from him

A WINRAR WILL BE CONFIRMED IF:
* You bake him a cake with a hacksaw inside

== Basic German Phrases to Include: ==
*"Frohe Weihnachten!" = "Merry Christmas"
*"Schreib zur√ºck!" = "Write back"
*"Du bist mein Held." = "You are my Hero."
*"Kannst du mir Tipps geben?" = "Can you give me tips?"
