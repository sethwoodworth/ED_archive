Convention

Where ugly [[nerd|nerds]] of a particular meet, get drunk, and try to have sex with that one puffed out, broken off chick who looks like someone poured a bag of cement into a [[Star Trek]] uniform. Often shortened to "con" in the vernacular of nerds in the know. Some cons are for a particular [[fandom]] or [[fetish]]. Large cons, which usually smell a whole lot worse, are inclusive to all nerds, regardless of whether they're able to answer the question, "Have you ever 'done it'?"

At a large con it would not be strange to see a [[gay]] [[vegan]] [[furry]] having sex with a [[Linux]]-using [[hippie]] [[poly]] dressed in [[SCA]] garb after playing a [[role-playing]] game, or trying to hang out with the guys from Gwar.


==LJDrama Convention==
[[user:Quasidan|Quasidan]] tried to organize an [[LJDrama]]Con2003 but nobody wanted to come to DC and he was too lazy to go anywhere else.

[[JeremyJX]], meanwhile, is attempting to organize something similar: [[lulzcon]].

[[Fail|fagmageddon]]]] is another LJ convention.

==Epic Fail Conventions==
[[AlCon]] is an [[animu]] convention in [[England]] which is run by idiots. Nobody wants to go to it, but that won't stop them stealing money from other idiots.

[[Girugamesh|Sakura-Con]] is an animu convention held in [[Washington]] which according to [[TOW]] was originally named Baka-Con; Baka is Japanese for [[idiot]].
