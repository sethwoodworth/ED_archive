'''Arbchat''' is the supreme [[Internet court]] of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. It was founded at least 4 days ago and is known as the "lulziest court in the land".

==Rules of procedure==
Cases cannot go directly to Arbchat but must first be handled by other means. If you wish to bring your case before Arbchat you must pay a filing fee in [[Internet money]] and show proof that you attempted to reach an [[Internet Settlement]]. If you wish to file a case against ED you are expected to be fully versed in the [[Internet Law]]. An [[E-lawyer]] is recommended but one will be provided for you if you cannot find any.
