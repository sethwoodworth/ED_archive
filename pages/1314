'''Cancer Jesus''' is the name given to the skinny messiah-like character in the [[#Background|music video]] 'I Feel Better' by the [[Britfag]] band [http://www.myspace.com/hotchip Hot Chip]. The phrase has been used by different users on different sites, including [[YouTube|YouTube]] and ShowHype, so its origin is [[Shit nobody cares about|unknown]]. The reasoning behind his name is self explanatory, but for the [[Retard|slower ones amongst us]]: It's because he looks like a bald Jesus wearing a patient gown. Indeed, what isn't there to love about this admixture of evil, lulz and [[bald|cue ball?]]

Cancer Jesus is played by actor/comedian [http://www.myspace.com/rossdavidlee| Ross Lee]. The music video was directed by Peter Serafinowicz, whom is regarded as the [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/mar/17/hot-chip-i-feel-better brainchild of the video.] The events in the video are as follows: Cancer Jesus gatecrashes a gig, causing much [[butthurt|butthurt]] to many. He proceeds to [[Shoop da Whoop|shoop]] the shit out of the boyband, killing them in much [[This Looks Shopped|SFX glory.]] After murdering them, he resurrects the group and breaks into song and dance, which [[Mind control|wins over the crowd entirely]]. However, before the dance can be finished, he flees the scene upon the arrival of his arch-nemesis: A floating Negro Head [[Fact|(Srsly)]]. The video has received [[Epic Win|much praise]] for its randomness and humor.

===Cult Following===

Cancer Jesus has received a small following on the internet, which has evidently recognized him as more than an [[anonymous]] character in a funny music video, but as a mock-christ-like Saviour. Wherever the video is posted, amongst the viewers is a handful of 'disciples' spreading his good name. He now has a fan page on [http://www.facebook.com/pages/All-Hail-Cancer-Jesus-3/113999671957189?v=wall#!/pages/All-Hail-Cancer-Jesus-3/113999671957189?ref=ts Facebook] and is also frequently posted on [http://memegenerator.net/Cancer-Jesus-/ImageMacro/837540/Cancer-Jesus-BEHOLD-MY-GOLRY-SHINES- Meme Generator], although all of the images are [[unfunny]], [[Gay|fags.]]

==The Mystery of Negro Head==
[[Image:Rodproof.png|thumb|400px|Bah, close enough.]]

In the music video an antagonist arrives in the form of a giant head, who attempts to shoot the shit out of everyone after Cancer Jesus flees the scene. However, because the actor's identity is more occult and the fact that [[Racism|all black people look the same]], a handful of people have theorized his identity. 

For example, the Giant Head shares an uncanny resemblance to 'Rod the Head' who was [[Raptor Jesus|God's]] cousin and right hand man (in everything but the physical sense) from an old Disney show called [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118487/ Teen Angel]. Others have suspected him to be the following:

* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_5360000/newsid_5360300/5360340.stm Popeye Man] (Claudio Paulo Pinto); World Record holder for eye popping.

* Jesus' semi-retarded half-cousin.
