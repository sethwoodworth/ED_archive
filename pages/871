Batabii
{{potential}}<br/>

[[Image:71.87.113.191batabiiiiii.PNG|thumb|Being so special, he requires a search tag defining his special interests.]]
'''Batabii''' is a [[autism|weird]], antisocial 25 year old [[virgin]] [[furfag]] from [[Wisconsin]] who gained popularity on [[FurAffinity]] and some obscure [[furry]]-related [[imageboard]]s. He is known for ass-licking [[mods|nazi mods]] like [[pinkuh]], and playing the bounty hunter in reporting any image violations he can find -  especially minor infractions and [[trolling|fandom-themed parodies]]. He does this simply [[Trying too hard|to prove]] that he's [[the best]] person in the world, [[Moralfag|and thinks his actions should serve as an example to others]], while the rest of the fandom thinks he should just shut the fuck up and [[get a life|find something else to do]]. He seems to enjoy [http://wildcritters.us/wc/user/show/248 under-age furry porn quite a bit], and is likely to have a folder full of [[CP]]. [[Butthurt]] for not being able to draw for shit, as well as being an uncreative and useless [[douchebag]], he is the prime example of a frustrated [[furry]], as the only thing he can do is threaten and criticise artists for their submission titles, descriptions, and search tags. The case of Batabii remains an issue that people with [[autism]] have: the fear of being disorganized. Hence, Batabii's abnormal and incoherent obsession for rule enforcement. It is not [[you]] who has a problem with authority, it is simply him filling his desire for everything to be as meticulously organized as possible, so just ignore his threats, especially if he [[stalker|adds you to his watch list]]. It's hard to determine one's intentions, why they are like this, and what motivates someone to spend 40 hours online on a website for the sole purpose of spamming the admins with reports.

==Contradictory Attitudes==
[[Image:Dred.jpg|thumb|right|YOU DID IT WRONG]]
===Censorship Laws===
While Batabii often demonstrates an incessant need to suck on the dicks of those in power by reporting minor infractions and generally being a whiny bitch, Batabii exhibits an almost fanatic obsession with [[censorship]] and Japanese law. He scours imageboards looking for censored porn and leaves long, incoherent rants about how he'd rather not see a picture at all than to see it censored. He also frequently sends messages to Japanese artists [[hipocrite|berating them for following the law]] and censoring their artwork. On sites with a voting system, he gives low votes to images that are censored out of principle.<br/>From this perspective, Batabii almost appears to be an [[anarchy|anarchist]], in stark contrast to his authoritarian views on just about everything else.

===Sending Nudes to Kids===
In an even bigger demonstration of disregard for laws and rules, and despite his proclaimed reverence for all that is righteous and true, Batabii actually has no qualms about handing out nude photos of himself as well as pictures of himself pissing his underwear to [[13-year-old boy|underage boys]] in chat rooms. The following pictures can be found [http://www.megaupload.com/?d=6OUOF865 here]; a handful of other pictures of Batabii you probably never wanted to see in the first place.

== B&! ==
[[File:permabanbatabii.jpg|thumb|right|After how many years? Nice hustle, Fagoneer]]

FurAffinity's ballsless admins finally grew a pair and dropped the banhammer on Batabitch. The furfags of FurAffinity have been saved! Or have they?

No, probably not.
