Daney21
Dana Stillwagon (or "Daney21") is an [[eBay]] user who attempted to auction off her children's [[Beyblade]] toys to punish them because she claimed that the boys had severely damaged one of the bathtubs in their home.  According to her listing (item #280625155361), the repairs were going to cost $500.  The listing included a photo of the two boys.  The youngest boy was holding a plastic bag containing the toys being sold while the oldest boy appeared to be crying.  The auction attracted the attention of several popular websites, including [[4chan]] and [[somethingawful]], and the highest bid eventually rose to $999,999.00 before the auction was canceled.

In her listing, Dana wrote:

''"We are selling 8 Beyblades, 2 of them light up. As you can tell they are not happy about this! They have been using their bathtub as a "battle arena" and Beyblades + Bathtub = Destruction!!! With the metal ones they managed to scrape the enamel off the tub, take a chunk of tub out and break off the soap holder. SO if you "win" this auction DON'T play with in a bathtub!!! We have [[Intelligent_people_can_spell|recieved]] a quote of $500.00 to replace the tub, some tiles, and soap holder + labor of course! They had [[Intelligent_people_can_spell|approxamently]] $125.67 in their piggy banks that will be going to toward the cost. We will use the profit from this auction towards the balance and then it is onto other toys!"''
