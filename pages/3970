Illemonati
[[Image:BeatlesLover.jpg|thumb|This is what we assumed to be BeatlesLover. We were wrong.]]

A bunch of lowlife ED [[vandal]]s. Although [[User:BeatlesLover|BeatlesLover]] started the attacks, he only made three edits that could be considered vandalism. Other users, such as [[User:Ontac|Ontac]], blanked many pages in a cheap and horribly thought out attempt to destroy the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. After pestering ED with their petty vandalism attacks, they became too overconfident and left this message on [[User:Thedreadedkettle|Thedreadedkettle]]'s userpage:

:''Dear Mr. Kettle. Of course it\'s me again. Actually it is a select group of the Illemonati who have decided that this website must be destroyed. No, we are not going to tell you what the Illemonati are, as I\'m sure you could arrange for a swift retribution, and we surely don\'t want your type desecrating our forum. We are using proxies, so banning won\'t do much. In conclusion, I would like to say, DIAF j00 fucking moron. Thanks. ~Ontac''

This was mentioned in IRC where the term 'illemonati' was made fun of as a supposed typo. Then Mr. Kettle searched for this term and got [http://ld.fubaria.org/wiki/Main_Page a wiki with almost no content]. Here the user page of BeatlesLover was found. Sheneequa then used her wikiskillz to check the history and find an IP used back in March and saw this was the same as the CheckUser [[IP]] from July 1st. 

A WHOIS later showed BeatlesLover is from Kutztown University, and a further google for more info showed the Lemon Demon [[forum]]s on page 3. Here the random [[forum]] was clicked and a '14 reasons to destroy ED' topic was near the top. The topic had 5 pages of people saying '''"OMG THEY INSULTED NOUN!"''' The group later experienced [[troll's remorse]] when they realized how pointless it was to vandalize such a [[lulz]]y wiki.

:''Me be BeatlesLover! I’m a 15-year-old semi-sociopath who needs a life. [[TL;DR|Typically, I listen to classic rock...]]''

===[[User:Ontac|Ontac]]===
:''Well, my name’s [[Christopher Walken]] and I’m 15. I’m a [[Canadan|Canadian]] living in [[Engrish|Calfornia]], so my [[e-pal|friends]] tend to call me Canada… they’re not to original. Lemon Demon was really what got me into [[Buttsecks|music]]. I’m an insomniac (I’m writing this at 1:13 in the morning) and I’m very obsessive. If I get into something I will [[Wowzaz_86|go to far.]]''
