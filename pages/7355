Self-esteem
[[Image:self-esteem1.jpg|right|thumb|"But what do [[Me|I]] really think about [[me]]?"]]
Self-esteem was invented in 1957 by an advertising executive selling toothpaste. It caught on right away, then picked up speed in the mid-1970s, when every adults' nasal passages were packed with [[cocaine]] in celebration of the Me Decade. Expectations for self-esteem and personal gratification became so overblown in the following Generation X, most of them become [[Suicide|suicidal]] when confronted with [[angst]]-creating situations like stepping away from their [[Camwhore|cameras.]]

== Da [[Internets]] Influence On Self-Esteem ==

Until [[Al Gore]] invented the [[internets]], reality posed problems to self esteem. [[Fat]], [[Ass|smelly]], [[Virgin|celibate]], [[White people|pasty people]] [[Basement-dweller|who lived in their mother's basement]] would sometimes struggle with a nasty feeling of humility when confronted with graceful, athletic, popular [[Celebrity|celebrities]] on their [[television]]. Today, computer savvy people searching for validation can find it on the [[internets]], where they [[Emo|seek comfort]], [[Attention whore|fish for compliments]] and [[Pig|post naked pictures of themselves]] in [[blog]]s, [[forum]]s, and [[email]]s worldwide.

[[Journal]] communities cater to the voracious hunger for self esteem by providing all manner of stroking to participants. It would be a horrible, horrible thing if [[troll]]s [[:Category:Drama-generating techniques|disturbed]] the [[masturbation]].

Just remember: If you are ugly, you are most likely stupid as well.
