[[Image:RVMotivational.jpg|right|thumb|Rosario+Vampire summed up in one image.]]
Rosario + Vampire is yet another [[Animu|anime]] about monsters and superpowers. 

Created by a [[sick fuck]], it consists of all the things needed in an anime:
* A [[loli]]
* A vampire
* A weak [[Mary-Sue]] male character with no personality 
* [[Whore|Batshit hot chicks with big boobs]]
* predictable plotline with no originality whatsoever

It's a show that every anime website has [[1337|GIGABYTES]] of [[34]] of, and as of 2010, is the most fapped to thing on the internet by [[lusers]], except maybe for [[Lord of the Rings]].[http://konachan.com/post?tags=rosario%2Bvampire&searchDefault=Search [1]][http://www.aerisdies.com/album.php?id=10061 [2]] (Lol [[404]] images)

==Plot==

Turning its back on every chance of originality or relevantly reasonable plot, it starts off with the story of the male character, [[Loser|'''Tsukune Aono''']]. Like in any other animu, he's a [[Pussy|normal boy]] with no personality or powers. 

Because he is a huge fucking [[failure]], his parents desperately get him enrolled in the shittiest school they can find, which turns out to be [[what|a sooper-sekrit educational facility for Japanese monsters and demons]]. The only one who knows he's not supposed to be there simply because he's human, thus a weak pussy, is '''Moka''', who happens to be the vampire the series is named for.

'''Moka Akashiya''' is a pink-haired [[cumdumpster|girl]] who is supposedly [[Cocktease|innocent]], despite having a two-inch-short skirt allowing her [[ass]] and panties to roam free and be visible to anyone wanting to take a look, just like [[asking for it|every other female character in the series]]. She has a magical rosary around her neck that, when taken off, lets the vampire inside her free. 

In the school for monsters, Tsukune meets another [[Homestar Runner|blue-haired animu girl]] named '''Kurumu Kurono''' with huge fucking [[Tits|jugs]] that jump all around the place at the smallest movement. Even though she's not as pretty as Moka, her gargantuan [[milk bags]] make her fuckable and a welcome subject of [[Rule 34]]. There is no logic to it but she, too, falls madly in love with Tsukune and does weird shit to him (like rubbing her two "weapons" against him. It turns out she's a succubus and she tries to [[rape|seduce]] him, proving she's a [[slut]]), but she [[Fail|fails]] after Rosario stops her. 

Another stereotypical character is '''Yukari Sendo''', another [[Mary-Sue]] in the story. She is the smartest student in the academy despite being [[Loli|11 years old]], and is a pint-sized [[Lesbian|dyke]] who's fallen for Moka-san. Consequently, she follows the object of her lust, constantly [[almost raped|grabbing her breasts and more]].

Contents of this particular [[animu]] include panty-flashes, a talking Fact Bat, monsters who jizz all over the place, idolizing somebody's huge [[boobs]], and the staple of [[Japan|the Land of the Rising Sun]], [[pedophilia]].



In summation, the anime is perfect for [[Basement dwellers|guys]] who like [[animu]] that let them pretend [[unrealistic expectations|they'll one day be surrounded by women who want nothing but their penis]]. It also offers many [[Masturbation|fap]]-able images. 

There is a second season, which is just like the first one except with [[furries]].

==Season 2==
CAPU 2 has [[moar]] of everything the first season had, including redundant and predictable plots.

|It would be cooler if that chick was [[lolwut|sucking on the cross]], still hot though|How? How would that make an image hotter?

== Characters ==
'''TSUKUNE'''- the leading male character of the series. Though he is constantly surrounded by [[tits|busty]] [[whores|chicks]] and [[lolis]] he acts like a total [[fucktard]]. He constantly [[DO NOT WANT|denies]] the wimmenz vying for the right to own his [[penis]], which makes him a [[retard]]. 'Tsuck me' is a typical [[animu]] [[pussy|nice guy]] and for some reason wants to remain a [[virgin]].  [[woman|Weak and helpless]], he always needs to be rescued by his vampire girlfriend. Basically, he makes this series into [[Twilight]] with the [[Rule 63|genders reversed]]. This is easily explained when you realize that 'Tsuck me' has [[Homosexuality|the gay]].
[[Image:Nooo..i'm_Gay.gif|right|thumb|[[DO NOT WANT]]]]


'''Moka Akashiya'''-The leading bitch in the series has serious family issues something about her daddy raping her or her sisters, or her sister raping her or some whole rape history shit. Moka is a [[vampire]] and when she [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|goes into full vampire mode]] she means BUSINESS with her catch phrase [[In the kitchen|"KNOW YOUR PLACE"]]. Moka in her first form is also known as "Capu-Chu". She is [[asking for it|in love with 'Tsuck me']]. It is proven that Moka needs to consume [[cum|human bodily fluids]] every day and in the end of every episode tries to suck off the main character, who won't let her because he is a colossal [[faggot]].
[[Fact|WARNING-Moka is a Cullen.]]
[[Image:Edward cousin.jpg|left|thumb|Twilight+Rosario??]]


'''Kurumu Kurono'''-Typical [[cumdumpster|woman]] and bigger than average [[slut]]. Kurumu is a succubus--a demon whore that likes to fuck both man and monster, and can drink [[OVER 9000]] gallons of [[cum]]. Kurumu loves to throw her [[tits]] around and is Moka's arch rival for 'Tsuck me's' [[cock]]. It is said Kurumu has [[raped]] [[over 9000]] men. Kurumu has the powers to seduce any man and the ability to transform into a [[Cockmongler|bat like creature thing]]. In addition, her skill of being a [[cocktease]] is unmatched and her Boob to the Head and Face Rape attacks are very formidable. Unlike a pussy vampire she's does'nt need cum or blood for foodz, but still robs men of their testicles and semens [[IDIFTL|for the lulz]].
WARNING-Kurumu's [[your mom|mother]] has boobs that are [[OVER 9000]] times bigger than hers and makes Kurumu's chest look as flat as a board...
[[Image:CUM SLUT.jpg|right|thumb|Completely innocent.]]


'''Yukari Sendo'''- Token [[loli]] of the series and fulfiller of all the [[You|pedo's]] desires. Yukari is a [[bitch|witch]][[derp|(someone who uses magic)]] and carries a [[dildo]] with [[special]] powers which she calls a "wand". In almost every episode Yukari is shown in her [[underwear]]. Like all the other [[bitches]] she's in love with 'Tsuck me' and wants nothing more than his [[cock]] in her tiny [[pussy]].
WARNING- never fap to images of Yukari or she will HEX you.


'''Mizore Shirayuki'''- [[Emo]] [[cunt]] of the series. Like all the other [[Vagina|women]] in the series she wants [[cock]]; however, she is the only one who gets depressed over her [[fail|inability to get any]]. Mizore is a Yuki-Onna--a type of <strike>wapanese</strike> (it can't be wapanese if it's actual Japspeak, fucktard) ice demon. Mizore has ice powers and can freeze [[dicks]] and [[semen]] so that they don't spoil, which she then eats later. She is basically a walking refrigerator and fucking her will definitely give your dick a frostbite, which would one of the reasons why 'Tsuck me' doesn't fuck her, other than the fact that he's a [[FAGGOT]].
WARNING-Mizore is magnet for [[sick fucks]]. [[Srsly]] see episode 7 and 17.
[[Image:Fat mizore.png|left|thumb|Sick fuckery.]]


'''Kokoa Shuzen'''-Moka's younger sister and moar obligatory [[loli]]. [[Unfunny]] and is followed around by the Fact Bat.


'''Fact bat/Kou'''- was originally the narrator of the series and the most annoying character due to his tendency to [[cockblock|block pantyshots]]. Later revealed that he was Kokoa's [[dildo|sex toy]]. Fact bat ([[shit nobody cares about|who is actually named Kou]]) is a total [[fucktard]] and an annoying flying piece of [[shit]]. Also an example of [[Video Brinquedo|low quality animation]].
[[Image:Fact bat.jpg|right|thumb|150px|That Damn BAT]]



'''Ginei Morioka'''- Furry of the series specifically made to appease [[furfags]]. Ginei is a werewolf and would do anything to gets some ass, but strangely enough he never gets any despite being [[Alpha male|taller, stronger and definitely more man]] than 'Tsuck me'. Can't get any ass because he's a [[pervert]] who likes to take pictures of them naked and paste it on the [[internet]] for everyone's fapping pleasure. Also, like most [[furfags]] [[IRL]], he has a [[Edward Cullen|micropenis]].
[[Image:hot were wolf furry.jpg|left|thumb|That's right furries fap for me ha ha ha]]





'''Ruby Toujo'''-Another witch in the series (moar liek [[bitch]], amirite?),  a [[sick fuck|necrophiliac]] as she kept the dead corpse of her master for [[necrophilia|obvious reasons]]. The typical talkative whore of the series and can only be shut up by a [[cock]]in the mouth or a [[pimp|slap on the face]]. She also has the distinction of being the only female character who knows her womanly place as she is always seen cleaning and being everyone's maid.


''''Shizuka Nekonome'''-School teacher who is [[WHAT HAS SCIENCE DONE?|half cat and half human]]. Has nice tits for a wannabe [[furry]].

==How to troll==
===Anime Forums===
[[truth|Basically explain how this series is completely stolen from Twilight, that the girls are not hot, the excessive amount of child exploitation makes any fan of the show a pedophile, bring up any contradiction that the show makes (watch an episode, you'll find about 60 every 2 minutes), the lack of character development, the lack of emotion in the voice acting, the fact that no English dub exists, so anyone who watches it is a weeaboo fucktard who cries melodic tears in their bedroom while listening to Linkin Park, just wishing they were born in the Land of Moonspeak, and that the only reason people like this show is the excessive amounts of boob and panty shots.]]
===Forums That Have A Moderately Sane Userbase===
Just mention the show. Just the thought of this series will make any normal person [[RAGE]].
