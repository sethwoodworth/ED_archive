The Great Sonic-cide of 2007
{{pixplz}}

<noinclude>{{TOCright}}</noinclude>

'''[[The Great Sonic-cide of 2007]]''' was an event that began on January 2nd 2007 when multiple [[13 year old girl|female, 13-year-old]] ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' fans simultaneously announced that they were dying/were going to commit suicide on their [[deviantART]] journals for [[attention]]. Like many other [[fucktard]] fanbases, the majority of the surviving friends were either in on it, or believed the whole thing and collectively [[cutting|cut]] themselves at the news that one of their [[otherkin|kin]] parted this world.

[[Image:Mudkip is astounded.jpg|left|thumb|Even [[Mudkip]] was taken aback by the [[stupid|dumbassery]] that took place!]]

Little did they know (and boy, do they know VERY little) that the whole thing was a [[attention whore|scam in order to get pageviews]] and provide [[lulz]] for everyone else with an IQ above that of a toilet seat.

== Participants in The [[Suicide|Sonic-cide]] ==

===Yumi the Fox===
One of the people not a part of the original pact, but just a lame [[poser|copycat]] who toddled along after them when she saw their journals and thought it would be cool to get another 2,000+ pageviews too. Typical [[fantard|''Sonic'' kiddies]] are sheep, meaning Yumi figured it was cool following the crowd like all typical [[children]] do these days.

She was the first to admit it was a scam.

Oh, yeah, and her art is nothing short of classic emo/goth/''Sonic''/furry. Nothing special there.

Sample comments included:

'''LougaraSwifthart'''(see note at bottom of section) 
*''Next time just delete your account and save the internet the excess stupidity.''

'''Reply to LougaraSwifthart'''

*''You my dear friend, have just won one million intranets. You are full of win.
:''You are an hero.''

'''TwirlyEkaghist'''
*''Hey, uh Yumi, if it's okay if I [[buttsex|add you to my friends list]]?''

Supporters to this very day still say that Yumi DID in fact [[Almost died|almost die]] from an [[fail|attempt]] at [[an hero|suicide]], but she [[coward|backed out]] at the last minute much to the relief of [[idiot|friends]].

'''Note:''' Lougara is not one of the idiot [[preteen|tweens]] being made fun of. She was one of the original helpers in exposing the truth through her wonderful use of snarkage.

=== Rin ===
Rin was your typical deviantARTlet. She enjoyed [[emo|Linkin Park]], [[Neopets]] and venting her heartbreaking [[cutting|teenage angst]] through her sub-par, hackneyed ''Sonic'' fanart. Like any self respecting [[emo]] [[dyke]], she decided that [[permaban]]ning herself IRL would solve all her [[OTI|online]] [[shemale|problems]].

==== Quietly "passing away" ====
It is a little known (but fun!) fact that the alive and well Rin is indeed a batshit insane [[Sonic|Sonicophile]] with multiple personalities, each more [[kawaii]] than the last. When Rin forgot to take her [[Ripper|medication]] to prevent her from going [[Insane|batshit]], she effectively "killed off" one of her personalities like some fucked up teenage soap opera. Once she had done the deed, "Misty" stepped up to the plate and left the following heartfelt goodbye to "Misty"..er...Rin...or was it...aw, whoever the fuck:

{{squote|Well...how could I start this... :cries:
 
Er, well I'm sorry to tell everyone but...Rin is gone now. :cries:

I'm just posting this here because no one will look at my journal, but I know Rin had
friends and they would read this.

She left a note saying Sorry and to inform her friends, so that's what I'm doing. 
And she also left a few complaints about her life.

If you would want to know how she passed away, I can tell you. She did it herself...I 
feel like it's all my fault...I'm sorry everyone. And yes, I am crying. >_> And I'm 
sorry if I sound like I don't care, I do, it's just I sound that way about
everything. :cries:

-Misty:heart: :cries:

Note: I will keep her artwork up, but if I catch any stealers, I will take it down. 
Please notify me if you see any stealers. <_<|Rin}}

She faked it, duh.

[[LOL_WUT|As openly admitted by her own dad, she didn't actually die]]. Like many other sonic fan-girls that claimed in their journals that they were going to suicide, she was faking it (how shocking). Her [[Pedophile|father]] found out from another parent, but [[LOL_WUT|who honestly cares]]?

All the information can be found in her journal if you can be bothered to look. http://rin-the-hedgehog.deviantart.com/journal/11042068/#comments

=== Charceo ===
Charceo's "death" was the most controversial of the lot. She claimed to have been [[Fursecution|beaten]] by her parents to the point of not being able to breathe, but was still able to give shout-outs to all her Sonictard friends just in the nick of time. Shortly afterward, she wrote a journal explaining how she was dying. 

Later on in the comments, good ol' [[Devonti]] came in to keep her fantards updated on the situation with a detailed summary of Charceo's last moments. Instead of being a sane person and calling 9-1-1, she decides to call Devonti to let him know she's dying and to take care of her Neopets, which, as we all know, is naturally the first thing a dying person takes care of. Like any good [[whore|dramawhore]], she makes sure to break off while in the middle of [[Lie|important information]].

Info about this person has yet to be dug up, as they [[Deleting your livejournal|deleted]] their gallery. Chances are it was [[shit]] anyway.

{{quote|[[Bullshit|But seriously back then those were all fake, and this is for real]].|[[HAHAHA OH WOW|OH WOW]]}}

=== Tahnee-cat ===
The youngest of this group, in fact too young to even be on devianTART. Claimed to have [[An hero|suicided]] with bricks and knives. Then she came back from the grave to say that a [[nigra]] stole her football and broke her leg. LOL.

Due to her being underage, it's best to simply report her to get the [[banhammer]] on her back. That, or call her [[parents]] since deviantART is not made for little children. It does, after all, offer boobs for [[porn|Daily Deviation]].

== Other [[Fucktard|Fucktards]] of Interest ==

=== thesonickid ===

[[Image:The O RLY Hedgehog by thesonickid.jpg|thumb|Yes sir, the internet is serious business. Don't fuck around!!!]]

thesonickid is one of those pretentious, "talented", [[Cock|up and coming artists]] from deviantART, and one of the defenders of the [[circle jerk|''Sonic'' self-pwners]]. He claims that the internet is full of lies, libel, <font color="green">g</font><font color="red">a</font><font color="yellow">y</font> pride and serious business. He fills that dark, deep void in his soul by drawing painfully crappy ''Sonic'' fanart which his internet buddies all love (perhaps out of pity, teehee), despite being simply a haphazard collection of scribbles his mind shat out, probably after he smoked some mushrooms.

His knowledge of [[internet law]] is severely lacking. In <s>[http://spaction3.deviantart.com/journal/11415239/ this thread, for example]</s> [[DELETE_FUCKING_EVERYTHING|BALEETED]], he declares ED to be full of lies, [[libel|slander]] and "bashing" without having an inkling of what the fuck he is talking about. Like the hundreds of deviantART fgts who were offended by The Great Sonic-cide of 2007, he will whine about it in his dA journal about how mean ED is, how ED supposedly organized teh nasty raids, and how the internet is srs biz, like the beacon for 7chan [[/i/nfidels]] that he is.

=== Laura Hedgehog ===
Was mistakenly labeled as one of the masterminds of the mass suicide scam, but that was giving her too much credit. In reality, she's just another [[stupid|pathetic]] [[13 year old girl|11 year old girl]] who believes everything she sees online at first glance, and is too much of a [[retard]] to pay attention or listen to evidence stating the contrary. 

She will go down in history as nothing more than a footnote on this [[lulz|lulzfest]].

=== Bianca [[teh|TEH]] Hedgehog ===
Not a participant in the suicide pact, <s>but an overseer and possible mastermind behind some of the accounts of the people who supposedly died</s> OBJECTION! She's too much of a fucking idiot to have schemed this. Her account [http://biancatehhedgehog.deviantart.com Bianca TEH Hedgehog] had her listed as underage and as per [[deviantART]] TOS a direct violation of site policy. To top that off, she had a signature admitting that she was the same person from a banned account known as [http://biancathehedgehog.deviantart.com Bianca THE Hedgehog]. So, this user was not only breaking the rules by not being old enough to even be on DA, but she was ban evading as well. Since then she has been permanently removed from [[deviantART]] along with several other suspected accounts that she used to mass [[spam]] the helpdesk with fraudulent tickets stating that [http://cjade.deviantart.com/ CJade] was the one breaking rules, which was blatantly not true.

Tabs will be kept on this [[tartlet]] for when and if she ever returns, as reporting this user is for the benefit of all to make her [[GTFO]] the [[internet]].

<strike>NEWEST ACCOUNT ALERT! [http://biancadahedgehog.deviantart.com/ Bianca da Hedgehog]...You'd think the least she could do is pick a username that isn't a clone of her other, now banned, account names. [[stupid|LOL SHE B SMRT]].</strike>  HODAMN! Banhammered!

=== JammingGirl4893 ===
"hai guys im 14 but i wish i were older so im gonna go and find a chaso emerald and make myself 17 lol!"

A new one to add to the mix, and yet another [[preteen]] who believed everything she read, and refused to acknowledge or listen to evidence stating the contrary, until Charceo finally admitted that it was all indeed true. Currently she has [[whining|declared war]] on this page as well as a number of DA users that she accuses of making this page, but really has no evidence to prove it.

The fact is that sites like these are public access and any [[moron]] who can manage to get an account by following directions instead of [[cutter|cutting]] themselves over online drama can edit this page to say anything they want. [[O rly|YARLY]]!

=== Snow Cake ===
Charceo's accomplice and stool pigeon ([[Devonti]]'s too). She posted the journal telling everyone the entire suicide pact was a huge lie, but was then supposedly banned off the internet by her "mommy" for a whole 24 hours before the internet withdrawal set in and she either begged or sneaked back on to resume her activities as normal. She has a very large distaste for ED (specifically this article), though like all the other pawns in this [[retarded]] chess game, she has yet to acknowledge it was the actions of a few very [[stupid]] [[attention whores]] that resulted in the event to begin with. 

Very shortly after returning, the harassment became too much for the [[tartlet]]. She removed her deviations(or put them in storage) and OMG LEFT DA FOREVERS, along with this simple yet to the point journal entry that reminds everyone that her grammar (along with her [[maturity]]) has much to be desired. 

=== [[Maddie]] Hedgehog ===
Yet another footnote [[tartlet]] who was late for the party and has to settle for harassing other members of [[deviantART]] to get people to talk to her. No matter the amount of the attention she strives for, it does not quench her insatiable desire to be [[buttsex|loved]]. Her actions are most likely explained by the fact that her mommy and daddy don't give a shit about her. 

Somehow, she managed to have a [[BFF|personal assistant]].

She briefly pulled a stunt involving an apparent [[IRL]] friend's account under the name [http://ithladore.deviantart.com Ithladore], where she tricked him into giving her his password and then proceeded to flame other members of [[deviantART]] so that he would receive the blame and get banned instead of her. However, Ithladore found out about the [[idiot|dumbassery]] and changed his password, issuing apologies and hopefully learning the lesson that giving other people your personal information is a very bad idea. 

==== Dose of Laughter ====
[[Maddie]]'s [[bitch|personal assistant]], not much else to say. She's lacking the proper brain activity to think on her own and settles for the closest possible thing. She didn't even make it to footnote status, showing how [[stupid]] she really is.

Currently ban evading at [http://moonbeam-teh-foxxie.deviantart.com/ this account]. ('''Update!''' Looks like the silly twat zigged when she should have zagged. Banhammer victorious!)

=== Zamie Cat ===
The newest [[idiot]] who, with the rest of her [[moron|friends]], likes to use the concept of [[whining|free speech]] to justify her [[bitch|bitching]]. Being a stupid [[cunt]], she doesn't realize that free speech also applies to people other than herself and her inner circle-jerk of fandom wankery. She is ignorant to the meaning of things such as "satire", and refuses to learn because that would mean she'd have to use what few braincells she has to focus on something other than [[masturbating]] to pictures of Sonic ramming Tails up the ass.

==== [[Spaction3]] ====
Zamie Cat's personal [[whore|manslut]] who whines about being oppressed on the internet, yet threatens people that his mommy ([[e-lawyer|a lawyer, HOSHIT!]]) will put them in prison whenever someone threatens HIS way of thinking.

== The Tribute to those...Lost? ==
Shortly after the Sonic-cide, a brave soul who remains nameless added a chilling monument to this senseless loss of life. The name of this memorial is "Deadpplztribute" [http://deadpplztribute.deviantart.com], as it is a tribute to all of the pplz dead because of [[Sonic]]. That blue motherfucker, it's all his fault.  

There is a lot of cutting edge technology on this tribute, including a real-time [[camwhore|webcam]], which captures the activities of all those who committed Sonic-cide after they attained [[zombie]] form. What follows is a real-time stream from their webcam. Real time [[snuff]] porn!

Some haters like [http://creamkawaii.deviantart.com/ creamkawaii] thought that this tribute was a hoax, and was in [[too soon|poor taste]]. Let the world be assured, however, that Deadpplztribute is indeed [[serious business]].

Much to the chagrin of deadpplztribute, many of the people the memorial was dedicated to revealed themselves to be liars who only suffered a mild case of [[Almost died|the highly contagious amongst morons "Almost Death" disease]] due to their critically low level of neurons and synapses inside of their brains. The tribute has shown no signs of closing, as there will be other deaths to mourn possibly next year when the ''[[Sonic]]'' <s>[[lemmings]]</s> [[fanboys|fans]] reinstate their pact. We can only hope that they actually go through with it next time, and with the tactic to jump off of small cliffs with rusty nails and kitchenware tied to their bodies.

1/2/07 NEVAR FORGET

== The Aftermath ==
As shown in the links below, several of the participants in the fake suicide pact have been banned, while others were banned by association for being [[fucktard|fucktarded]], or simply have fled their accounts to start anew because it's a fact that whiny [[emo]] fantards are also [[liberal|huge cowards]].

== Criticisms? ==

=== WAR ON ED ===

'''EXTRA! EXTRA! [[sonic|SONIC]] FANS DECLARE WAR ON ED!'''

That's right folks, numerous ''[[Sonic]]'' fans have taken to the streets and consulted their [[parents|mommies and daddies]], some of whom are [[e-lawyer|lawyers]]. They claim they will file legal suites against Encyclopedia Dramatica because [[EDiots]] have little tolerance and [[emo|understanding]] for whiny [[shit|shits]] who act like [[stupid|dumbasses]] by pulling pranks to get [[attention whore|attention]], and who rightfully deserve to have their names immortalized so when they grow up and create spawn like all good [[retard|"normal people"]] they'll hopefully look back on their own [[fail|failure]] and maybe do something other than [[fatty|watching TV and eating Cheetos]], to make sure their own [[children]] don't follow in their footsteps.

In the meantime, expect plenty of vandalism of this article as well as threats and [[bitch|bitching]] about how a bunch of [[13 year old girl|11 year old tweens]] are going to conquer and destroy ED. <s>HAHAHA, disregard that i suck cocks!</s> Yeah. No.

=== SEROUS BISNUSS LOL! ===

In an [[Shit nobody cares about|unimportant]] corner of [[lolcats|THA INTARWEBZ]], [[Drama Llama|a person]] made a thread where people post [[fail|funny stuff]]. In the ''first page'', [[Furries|somebody else unimportant]] [[Copypasta]]'d good ol' [[retard|Misty]]'s [[lulz]]-filled quote for everyone on the [[Nobody Cares|site]] to see. While anyone in their right mind would find this [[Lulz|hilarious]], the creator of the thread, [[Nobody Cares|BMF]], [[insane|berserked]], [[butthurt|minus-repped]] the person who posted it, [[attention whore|and complained to all the moderators]]. From this information, we can only assume that it's part of a conspiracy involving cake and [[lolcats]], and as such he must be officially marked an enemy of the lulz.

* [http://creamkawaii.deviantart.com/ CreamKawaii] - Not an actual participant in the "mass death", which makes her not an [[emo|emoshit]]. Has hopefully learned her lesson to not believe everything she sees on the [[internet]].

* <s>[http://laurahedgehog.deviantart.com/ Laura Hedgehog]</s> BANNED, Not a participant...just a [[fucktard|dumbfuck]] who fell for it <s>OR is one of the masterminds behind the whole thing.

* [http://zamiecat.deviantart.com Zamie Cat] - A [[moron]] who wouldn't know satire if it rammed its [[cock]] through her ear, and thinks her and her [[idiot]] friends can shut down Encyclopedia Dramatica through legal means because they have friends who were [[retarded]] enough to have been noticed for doing [[attention whore|stupid shit]] and being featured on this site. [[children|BOO HOO! So sad...]]

* [http://spaction3.deviantart.com Spaction3] - Friend of Zamie Cat, and someone who fell for the scam hook, line, and sinker. Kept whining about it even after he was proven to be [[stupid]] when most of the [[tartlet]]s fessed up that they lied. Has issues with people who do not share his exact opinions but bitches about being "oppressed" anytime someone dares to challenge his own. Currently is in talks with his mommy, who is an [[e-lawyer|internet lawyer]], to get ED removed from the [[tubes]] because of the Sonic-cide, and because his [[bitch]] Hikaritail managed to get herself listed on the [[deviantART]] list of [[fucktards]].

=== The Latest and Lamest ===

* <s>[http://reiquona.deviantart.com/ Reiquona]</s> BANNED, AKA: Charceo's latest ban evasion account as revealed by CreamKawaii. Reporting is optional, since no one gives a shit anymore and any [[e-fame]] and e-glory this TARTlet had is long gone.

[[Image:Soniccide-D.jpg|thumb|160px|Pretty self-explanatory.]]

It Also appears a new Emo fag has joined the group by the name of Kcirre who apparently was in a car crash and his surgery didn't go well oh BOO HOO so his brother decided that his friends on devianTART so needed to know 35 minutes after the death of his brother!!! Yeah cos if it was his brother why would he come on just after his brothers death for fucks sake wouldn't you be upset if your brother just died??!!?? I guess this fag just wanted the pageviews go here for some whining from his so called brother http://kcirre.deviantart.com/

http://chibisally1.deviantart.com/ Emofagtartletshadowcumslut in the form of a 11 year old ZOMG ShadAmy weeaboo. After whoring herself out on any persons page who dare fart in her direction and making a whole journal about how Sawnik was a bitch and wouldn't suck her tiny E-penis she made yet another lulz filled journal about how momma and dad abuse her and was now it was time for suicide which of course led to moar lulz. But after her fag cock sucker friends were banned for "not harassing other users" she has left for the pedoville known as ''[[Runescape]]'' after her E-penis disappeared into her ass.
