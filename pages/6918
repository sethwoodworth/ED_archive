'''Reliable sources''' are the bane of every POV-pusher's existence on [[Wikipedia]], and the love of every [[Bureaucratic Fuck]] trying to keep as much human knowledge out of the supposed all-encompassing [[encyclopedia]] as they possibly can. When a typical [[Wikipedophile]] tries to write an encyclopedia [[article]], they'll have to do so by [[citation needed|citing sources]]. However, since Wikipedia is [[serious business|serious fucking business]] and that avoiding [[original research]] is like a [[religion]] to them, not only do they want [[patent nonsense|uncited material]] removed; they want anything that does not conform with the [[white nationalism|Zionist media machine]] out of the encyclopedia as soon as possible, because they want to rewrite history just like they did with the [[lie]] that they made up about [[Hitler]] killing [[holocaust|6 million Jews]].

This means that not only are [[geocities|personal websites]] not acceptable as sources; [[tabloid]] <s>news</s>[[amirite|Jewspapers]] and even [[jews|local news outlets]] are not regarded as reliable sources, because they haven't been published in the [[mainstream]] (with the [[fish]]ies!) media. This systematic destruction of local knowledge by Wikipedos is a form of cultural [[armenia|genocide]] perpetrated by those suffering [[butthurt]] [[seeking]] revenge on the [[NORP|ordinary, innocent people]] who have done no wrong and are [[exploitable|being manipulated]], because history is written by the winner and nobody ever cared what the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaker_people beaker people] thought, and they won't care what [[you]] were [[Big Brother|made to think]] either.

If you are not part of the [[Cabal]], no matter how [[good article|good your article]] is, they will shoot you down by claiming that what you have written uses unreliable sources. They will never, ever let your article become a [[featured article]] if you use unreliable sources, because on the English Wikipedia the standards are so damned high for featured articles that it is impossible to create one if you are outside a [[clique]] elite. However on many non-English Wikipedias, if you'd written the same thing, you'd be able to get a featured article, even if the sources were of somewhat questionable reliability. This, again, is a form of [[discrimination]] against native speakers of the [[English]] language.

==What is a reliable source?==
Whilst [[you]]r website is unreliable, your [[blog]], [[MySpace]] or [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is dismissed as unreliable by elitist [[cunts]], some of the content in the [[old media]] is reliable, as long as it isn't targeted towards the working class, because they're [[ignorance|ignorant]] and they don't care if they're being [[Rupert Murdoch|spoonfed lies]].

Since Wikipedia is not the news (they have [[David Shankbone|Wikinews]] for that, [[lawl]]) there are a few other types of reliable sources. These include [[college|academic]] papers that have been [[anal|preferably published in peer-reviewed journals]], and books on certain subjects. However if the Wikipedo determines that the source is not [[NPOV]], then they will be deemed unreliable for promoting "[[JEWS DID WTC|fringe theories]]". This does a [[sarcasm|great fucking deal to advance]] "the sum of all human knowledge", because crappy magazine articles published by people paid by the government to numb the thoughts of the masses are instantly seen as reliable, whilst [[truth|shocking relevations]] must be kept out for the fragile little minds of the readership.

For example, when a shitty article about [[lolcat]]s is published in a 'reliable source', that instantly makes the subject '[[notable]]', because the journalists who write that [[shit]] are paid to do what would be called original research if someone wrote it on Wikipedia, but since the select few supposedly have control over what people think just because they write for the old media, it becomes a case of these journalists having the power to shape knowledge for the future. And believe us at [[ED]], they won't do it in a good way. Fuck the [[lie|misnomer]] 'reliable source', [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is the only source of truth on the [[internets]]. Even [[4chan]] has "The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and false[[clitoris|hood]]. Only a [[you|fool]] would take anything posted here as [[fact]]." at the top of its /[[b]]/ page, and even it contains a whole lot more information than Wikipedia that is actually useful.
