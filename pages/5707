NetWare

NetWare by [[Novell]] is quite possibly one of the greatest software products of all time. That is, if greatness to you is an application's complete inability to solve any apparent problem. Novell created NetWare to satisfy two requests:

*IT directors asking themselves the common question, "Hmm, I'm running a [[Windows]] network, but since I'm completely out of my fucking mind, I don't want to use any Microsoft networking. LOL I PREFER SOFTWARE FREE AS IN BEER [[Linux|LINUX]] RULEZ???"

*IT directors wanting to [[Profit]] but not smart enough to use UNIX (hence everything done in [[All Caps]]).

Using NetWare is vaguely like using Microsoft's Active Directory, in that NetWare is based on LDAP (<b>L</b>ame 
<b>D</b>irectory <b>A</b>narchy <b>P</b>rotocol). However, NetWare has a lot more of the gay in it, and uses a bizarre filesystem, file sharing protocol, and requires an installation of MS DOS to initialize itself. Seriously. Shutting down a NetWare system leaves you at a C:\NETWARE> prompt.
To restart the network, type "DEL *.* /S" (without the quotes, moron!) then hit <Enter> (See Using below, #3).

But even more than that, [[Truth|NetWare is just bad]]. [[Lie|It might have been great when Windows Server and Linux didn't exist]], back in the days when 686 Processors [[GoddessMine|dominated]] the server scene, but now there's no use for it. Its an operating system made just to torment operators. If you or anyone you know uses Netware for personal [[lulz]], please [[Rape|kill]] them immediately.
