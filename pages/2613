El Vendór
{{construction}}

'''El Vendór''' is a series of [[YouTube]] [[viral]] videos which rose to popularity in January 2011. The five part series is the tale of some douche called Dave who, after an altercation with his office's food vending machine, becomes trapped under the machine. Luckily for Dave, he still had his [[Android]] phone handy and proves to the rest of the office staff that he can survive because he has junk food and his Android phone handy. What they fail to mention is how and where he manages to piss and shit, but one assumes that there is probably an app for that too.

Basically, the videos are a wet dream coming true for [[Android]] [[fanboy]]s. They have been [[nobody cares|directed by some dude called Greg Bell]], who we can only imagine is either a big time Android sucker, a corporate whore or has had some messy experience with [[Apple]]'s horrid [[iPhone|GayPhone]].
