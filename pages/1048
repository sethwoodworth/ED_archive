Bloodydiaperman
'''bloodydiaperman''' is a [[lulz]] warrior who first came to [[Totse]] in late 2005 . This man was [[batshit insane]].` He had a [http://web.archive.org/web/20060820053539/http://witheredoaks.com/ site] in which he wrote about such glorious topics such as doing [[drugs]], ''eating wood screws'', unspeakable horrors involving [[Hitler|Hitler masks]], and [[sex|fucking various]] [[whore|prostitutes]]. It tells you something about a person when a [[German]] [[shit|Scheisse]] video involving a priest and a nun is on the front page.

===Delicious Toilet Paper, You Must Eat It===
<pre>I grabbed 8 feet of toilet paper and a 2 bottles of water,
then began my journey. Well, after making sure the
toilet paper wasn't used prior-like.</pre>

<pre>8:20 pm. It's been two hours since i ingested the toilet paper, my stomach it in so
much fucking pain it's unreal. Like I'm being stabbed in the ribs. I called poison
control and after convincing the lady this wasn't a prank, she advised me against
vomiting myself, saying that the toilet paper had most likely expanded and i will
probably choke. This was such a dumb fucking idea.

12:00 pm Saturday.  Well I spent most of last night in the hospital with severe
abdominal pain, i have upper GI bleeding. The screw showed up in an x-ray, and is
now in my intestines. I am trying to figure out a way to scan the entire x-ray and post
it. They told me i should be fine for now, but if the screw gets lodged i will need
surgery, then they gave me a script for 500 mg of cipro every twelve hours x 7 days.

2:15 The pain is back, but this time lower. it feels lik someone stuck an ice pick in my
belly button. BUT I did have one good thought on this procedure. Well if I ate that
much toilet paper, and eventually it will come out when i crap, will i need to wipe? I
mean shouldn't eating the toilet paper cut out the middle man. I think im on to
something here. wipeless shit, by eating toilet paper. Dig up Edison ,we got
something to tell him.

5:20 pm It's going to be a long night.

10:00 pm  I am bloodydiaperman.

9:40pm Sunday, i passed the screw. it caused less damage than i thought it would ,
and after carefully sifting through my own stool, i have found zero evidence of the
toilet paper ever existing.

Conclusion
On the plus side, i did find out that dry-wall screws are in fact edible.
negative side, i lost all respect anyone may have ever had for me, i lost a perfectly
good goldfish net sifting through my feces, my health insurance will probably drop
me now.
But it was worth it only because i now have a bloody ass, without being anally raped.
keep on truckin my friends, keep on truckin.</pre>

===Sponge Bob Sexy-Pants===
<pre>This girl killed animals as a child and
liked anal sex. She told me she rocked
but all i ever saw her do was play the
skin flute, and a few solo's on my
manjo.
Her crotch looked like
[[Spongebob]] Squarepants asshole.</pre>

==Campaign for Cincinnati City Council==
In 2006, Mr. Diaperman decided to run for public office and [[AIDS|give something back]] to his community. 

He and his associates created the [[Anarchy|Social Ironist]] Party

Voters, and the Council, were made aware of his antics and naturally he didn't stand a [[Fail|chance in hell of getting elected.]]  

Surely, it couldn't have anything to do with this little gem:
