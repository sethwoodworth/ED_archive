'''Futaba Channel''' (not to be confused with [[Futabachannel]]), also known as 2chan, is a [[Japanese]] imageboard, basically equivalent to [[4chan]] except with about 100 times more inexplicable memes and gibberish. It was founded in order to provide a backup when [[2ch]] went down but its image boards became far more popular, especially their /b/. It now has something like seven different /b/ boards, <s>all of which are about as popular as 4chan's</s> (see image). It also has boards for news, sports, trains, mahjong, and [http://www.bluethree.us/futaba/ a bunch of other utterly random shit].

[[You]] can't post on Futaba. All <s>non-Japanese</s> dirty gaijin IPs are banned due to [[spam]] and [[child porn]] that Japanese users like to sneak around through specially constructed international proxies. However, you are welcome to read it, if you are a [[weeaboo]].

They were there way before [[4chan]] users in terms of [[Sick Fuck|sick-fuckery]] and they still maintain their [[guro]] board long after 4chan abandoned it.
