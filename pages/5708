'''NetAuthority.org''' is a site which [[police]]s the internet looking for violations of the '''Internet Acceptable Use Policy''' (AUP). The Internet AUP was created by an dedicated team of online [[batshit crazy|nut job]] [[Christian]] [[racist]] wackos. The entire site is filled with awful 1980's style stock images of [[No_girls_on_the_internet | women using the computer]] and freakish little children dressed in graduation gowns. Every type of website [[Rule_34 | imaginable]] is listed as violating the AUP, so browsing the sites in their database can be illuminating, entertaining and harrowing, often all at the same time.

[http://www.netauthority.org/badges.html The badges] they have created for everyone to use are the most important part of the AUP protocol. Make sure to add at least one to your own site if [[Porn | necessary]].

== It's totally fake ==
Net Authority's domain was set up by some [[16-year-old girl]] named Rudis Muiznieks who is also the webmaster of [http://www.rudism.com/], mostly for lulz.

== AUP for the Internet ==

Some excerpts from the [http://www.netauthority.org/aup.html AUP: Internet Acceptable Use Policy].

'''Thou shalt not post pornographic material.''' <br>
There is a common misconception that pornography is limited purely to images or textual descriptions of an explicit sexual nature. This is not the case. Anything that can evoke impure thoughts in the mind of the beholder is pornographic.

'''Thou shalt not post hateful material.''' <br>
Any material that promotes or inspires hatred or violence towards any other person or group of people is strictly forbidden.

'''Thou shalt not post blasphemous material.'''  <br>
Any material that would lead one astray from the righteous path of the one true God must not be  permitted on the Internet. These days children are gaining access to the Internet at younger and  younger ages—a time when they are most vulnerable and susceptible to blasphemous viewpoints and suggestions.

'''Thou shalt not post materials of an offensive political nature.'''<br>

'''Thou shalt not post materials concerning bestiality, including interracial relationships.''' <br>
God did not intend for different species or races to intermingle sexually. Any content that   contradicts this natural law, directly or indirectly, is strictly forbidden.


<Big>'''Identifying an AUP Violator'''</Big>

Netauthority.org offers several guidelines to identifying violators. In addition to the five rules outlined by the AUP, it is suggested that internet users [http://www.netauthority.org/submit.html report the following content]:
*[[12chan|Naked babies]]
*Websites that indirectly contest [[Religion | biblical facts]] (such as those that promote ''theories'' about dinosaurs and evolution as ''facts'', rather than as tests of our faith in Him).
*[[Furry|Farm animal genitalia]]
*Any Pictures of babies (Ignoring the irony that Net Authority has several pictures of babies on it anyway)

<Big>'''What happens if you violate the AUP'''</Big>

If you are the webmaster of a site that is in violation of the Internet Acceptable Use Policy,  it is your responsibility to indicate this on your website until the offending content has  been fully removed.

You should indicate your site's non-compliance by including one of the above graphic badges in a prominent location on your website. You should [http://www.netauthority.org/database.pl?action=view&id=1720 link the  image to your entry in our database] for quick reference to the sections of the AUP that are  being violated, and the discussion of how best to remove the offending content.

Netauthority admins are double-talking hazards to all that is lol. Excerpt from sample discussion:
[[Image:Netauthority.org.jpg]]

Even if your website has evaded our offender database, if it is in violation of the AUP then it is your duty to report it to us and indicate its non-compliance with one of these badges.

''EncyclopediaDramatica of course takes the internet AUP very seriously and has many badges located throughout the site to indicate that it is currently a violator.''<br><br>

<Big>How to contact Rudis Muiznieks (the guy that made the site, its only him)'''</Big>

Try *67'ing 1.2399386632 perhaps ?
Maybe visit him at 1930 NE 13th Ct, Cape Coral 33909, Florida, USA ?
Possibly email him at rudis@sitosis.com ?
Or zoom down to his coordinates in Google Earth, which happen to be:
Latitude:      26°40'38.78"N
Longitude:     81°56'1.26"W


<Big>'''PWNing the AUP'''</Big>

It is recommended to sign this email: info@netauthority.org up for as many [[porn]], spam, and other malicious services including hatemail as possible to ensure maximum [[Lollercaust]].  Sending a [http://www.gayporncards.com/main.shtml Gay porn card] would be fine too. It is also good practice to use [[Megaloader]] against their site as much as possible.
