Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab
[[Image:Bpal_logo.jpg|thumb|right]]
Having perhaps one of the most [[magick]]al business names this side of Merlin's Ye Olde Mystical Apothacary Shoppe, '''Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab''' (called '''BPAL''' for short) is a [[Cockmongler|online peddler]] of scented oils.  [[semen|Scented oils]] with <strike>fucking hilarious</strike> wonderously illuminating names like [[pussy|Beaver Moon]], [[mung|Embalming Fluid]], [[Cthulhu]], and [[Fellatio|Le Serpent Qui Danse]].  They have a [[fat|large]] cult following full of rabid [[wiccans]], [[goths]], [[EGL|lolitas]], and [[DO_IT_FAGGOT|fags]] ready to jump your shit if you dare disrespect the company so proceed with caution.

Sshh, I <strike>hear</strike> smell them coming.

== The Introduction ==

{{quote| Welcome to the Lab! We specialize in formulating body and household blends with a dark, romantic Gothic tone.

We are the first of our kind, and have over 10 years of practical experience in the field, and our expertise shows.|Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab|[http://www.blackphoenixalchemylab.com]}}

As this statement sums up everything about this company nicely we could end the article on this subject right here, but this is just the surface of BPAL's [[lulz|legacy]].

== Sniffing Parties ==
Originaly the domain of the rich and powerful in the [[At_least_100_years_ago|70s and 80s]], sniffing parties have been taken away from CEOs, [[cocaine]], and the whores who want them.  Sniffing parties have been given back to the people!  -[[furries|Large, ill-smelling people]].  Now groups of BPAL fans get together [[wut|all over the world]] to smell each other's perfume and trade their liquid crack with each other.  You'd think that at these parties they are mainlineing ''Dragon's blood resin with white sandalwood, dusty orris and crisp blondewood'', but nay, they are mainlineing moonbeams, fairy dust, and The Goddess herselyf.  '''DO NOT FORGET THIS IMPORTANT FACT, MUNDANES!'''

Be it called a sniffing party, meetup, sniff 'n' meet, or [[orgy]], despair in the fact that right now there is middle aged women in a room cooing over the latest rare perfume blend [[bukkake|slathered]] all over the skin of their peers.
== The Further Adventures of BPAL Junkies ==
A popular activity is to [[World_of_Warcraft|horde]] limited edition scents and then [[pimp]] them out to other <strike>crack</strike> scentwhores for cash or other oils.  [[Last_Thursday|Years back]], BPAL took a month or longer to mail out orders, so [[fans]] have retained a do-or-die mentality about collecting their favorite spunk lest it be gone forever.  They will fight each other to the death over [[eBay]] or [[LiveJournal]] to get that [[shit|special scent]] and will publicly cry over their loss if beaten to punch.

Another thing deemed normal and totaly [[kawaii]] by junkies is to make icons, big and small, for their most favoritest scent.  Hours upon hours will be spent in Photoshop getting their expression of love ''just right'' for the approval of their heavily scented peers.  In fact there is [http://www.madamedynamite.com/ entire websites] and [http://community.livejournal.com/the_icon_lab/ LJ communities] devoted to this activity, being one of the only things collectors will do outside of rapidly clicking on BPAL's online shopping cart.

== Dragon's Blood Scented Drama ==
Not just limited to the previously mentioned duels over bottles of perfume, the BPAL community is constantly filled with the highest quality [[drama]].  Seething hatred flows from their fat-clogged veins over such such topics as the labels on the bottles, people wanting way too much for discontinued perfumes, if someone also likes [[drunk|LUSH]] soaps or not, and other things worthy of [[old|40-year-olds]] acting like [[16-year-old girls]] on the internet.

[[Anonymous]] hate memes are common, as is fandom-wide brawls over the silliest shit.  Friendships have been forged and ended bitterly over overpriced perfume oils, a nonstop circle jerk of [[epic]] proportions.  Dare you defile the name of BPAL founder '''Beth''' and a legion of [[otherkin|magickly inclined warriors]] will storm your e-fortress and try to make you feel really, really bad about yourself.
