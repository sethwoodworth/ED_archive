<br>
On Monday the 20th of September 2010 (or not), [[jock|rugby league tough guy]] Joel Monaghan and his teammates went out to some clubs to celebrate the end of a season by getting [[drunk|pissed rotten]]. After a bit of [[cosplay|dressup]] fun, they all headed to the house of an absent teammate who owned a labrador which Joel knew had been especially trained to enjoy licking human genitals. Downing a few, and [[for the lulz|just as a joke]], Joel decided to show them [[Bestiality|the dog's special training]]. After he pulled his own pants down to enjoy the paws that refresh, a couple of teammates decided to give him a hound in reaching infamy by taking photos and later circulating them. They eventually reached some particularly [[retard]]ed [[leftard]] who posted them under the name of a politician. The timing of this narrative doesn't make sense so is probably [[lie|invented bullshit]], see 'Timeline' below on that.

==Oh, the Bestiality==
Stupid reporter gets wet from viewing the photo, can't get it out of her mind, who should be shocked?
{{quote|I am hard to shock but I strongly advise anyone who is curious to avoid at all costs looking at the image. It is base, depraved and vile. It is also very difficult to expel from your mind.|[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/nrl/with-mates-like-these/story-e6frfgh6-1225948534573 Concerned Reporter]|color=silver|size=360%}}.

Joel Monaghan is now an ex-[[rugby league|NRL]] player for the time being and confirmed [[dogmongler|dingo-mongler]], who has joined the prestigious ranks of [[fisting|John Hopoate]] and [[scat|Julian O'Neill]] by stirring the ever-flowing pot of lulz that is rugby league. In late [[2010]] a photo began circulating on the internets of a dog retrieving a different kind of ball from this dingomongler. Thankfully for [[Fag|Jason Akermanis]] it wasn't a [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/stay-in-the-closet-jason-akermanis-tells-homosexuals/story-e6frf9ix-1225868871934 that's a whole different story].

==[[Twitter]]==
[[File:Twitpicnogo.png|thumb|[[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]]? - too late faggot.]]
[[Leftard]] [[twitter|twat]] {{twitter|WyattRoyMP}} broke the story via TwitPic as some kind of [[lame]] propaganda, and [[old media]] are shitting themselves in envy.  He claimed the act had been necessary to highlight the issue of [[PETA|animal cruelty]], and that he obtained the photograph from a 'friend', who said it had been circulating around ACT rugby league circles for 'the last two weeks or so'.  

{{quote|After copping numerous threats I removed all pics from Twitter but left them on Twitpic.}}

He also claims to possess [[MOAR|other photos]] of Monaghan, doing God-knows-what with helpless animals.  The [[furries]] await these with bated breath. The [[Partyvan]] is also after fake WyattRoyMP for doing it in a lame attempt to defame a relatively innocent politician.

==The Taiwan Treatment==
The channel formerly known as Apple News does a slightly inaccurate but lovely job.

==Past Relationships==
Much like the [[Tiger Woods]] scandal, once the dam breaks, there's a flood to follow. Some of his other [[bitches]] have come forward to reveal a long line of puppy love.

==Coming Soon==
[[Image:examples.PNG|thumb|right|These freaks seem to see beastie fellatio as a team-builder.]]

Joel intends to head for the [[UK]] to wait out his 'disgrace'. Plox start practising the doggy noises [[rugby league|Super League]] fans. Leeds followers are already calling him 'Lassie' and 'Rex' in debates on recruitment.

==Timeline Does Not Add up==
The claim was that this event happened on 'Mad Monday', a post-season celebration where 'the boys' are expected to act up, so providing something of an excuse (hey, it's Mad Monday, getting a hound to lick my [[dong]] is kind of natural). This doesn't make sense. The animal shot was taken some time in the afternoon, [[cosplay]] scenes at the local club are probably not really from the same day, and he wouldn't have still been standing too much longer after the dog day afternoon if he'd been as [[drunk]] as the official story has it. A recent press article slyly hinted that the doggy [[lulz]] really happened on Friday the 17th of September, not 'Mad Monday'.

[[Image:Kearns_and_dog.PNG|thumb|right|Phil Kearns led the way, but the incident's a state sekrit, made the Tele but he got that plumbed.]]
==Rugby Tradition==
Monaghan is said to have been inspired by the exploits of fellow rugger bugger Phil Kearns, widely reputed to have been involved in a similar incident in 2003 (comments on this are being taken down everywhere at time of writing), with video taken by his wife ([[OMG]], what a [[bestiality|bugger]]).
