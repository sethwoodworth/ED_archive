Karl Rove
{{potential}}
{{warning|Moby Dick has left the building}}
[[Image:Daily_News_Bush%27s_Brain.jpg|thumb|Karl Rove was known as [[W|Bush's Brain]]. This can be attributed to the fact that [[W]] doesn't have one.]]
'''Karl Rove''' (also known as '''Moby Dick''' (to the Democrats), '''Turd Blossom''' (to [[W]]) and '''MC Rove''' (to the [[:Image:Negro_community.jpg|black community]]), is the undisputed, [[fat|heavyweight]] champion of political assassinations. If you asked most people the question, "Who was the 43rd president?", they will most likely tell you that [[George W. Bush]] was. This is, in [[fact]], pure [[bullshit]], as Bush was merely a mindless puppet summoned by Karl Rove using [[Wicca|Satanic rituals]]. Rove himself was the [[Retard|mastermind]] behind the machine that was the [[Epic fail|Bush Administration]], and all of their malevolent affairs. '''MC Rove''' is best known for pretending to love [[goatse|golf]], and caring about the needs of the [[sheep|American public]].  [[IRL]], Rove tends to resemble Emperor Palpatine.
==Origins==
[[Image:Karl_rove_bush.jpg|thumb|Will the real president please stand up?]]
Along with other now disgraced [[fanboi|loyal Bushies]] such as Attorney-General [[Secret Squirrel]], White House counsel Harriett Miers, and [[liar|press secretary]] Scott McClellan, Rove was one of the infamous '''Texas Mafia''', <i>the</i> driving force behind the makeover of [[W|George W. Bush]] from  a drug addled, drunken, draft-dodging [[college|Yale]] [[whore|cheerleader]] who had totally failed it in the [[oil|private sector]], into the Governor and Chief Executioner of [[Texas]]. 

From there, Rove set his sights on the White House and the presidency of the [[United States]] using skills he had learned as a [[13-year-old boy|small boy]] obsessed with [[sockpuppet|ventriloquism and puppetry]].

==Rove's Takeover of America==
[[Image:Bushkarlrove.jpg|thumb| While some say "'''FUCK BUSH'''", ''Turd Blossom'' Rover has already been there done that]]
In the mid 90s, Rove decided to take control of the American government. Not being 
particularly friendly, even in his human disguise as a balding white man, he used his 
knowledge of the dark arts to create a puppet of low intelligence, which he disguised as 
George W. Bush, Jr., and further rituals convinced Bush Sr. and the public that there had
always been a Bush Jr..
From there, it was simply a matter of fixing the election, which was a piece of [[cake]] for 
Rove. Once in control, he began to implement policies both foreign and domestic according 
to his whims. So far, he has led America into attacks on two foreign countries, causing 
only eternal unrest in both of them, turning the locals into flag-burning, suicidal 
[[Muslim|towel-heads]].
One can only hope that Karl Rove will be satisfied with 8 years of rampaging and not 
try for 8 more with [[Sarah Palin|another puppet]].

==Defeating Karl Rove==

[[Image:Rovenstein.JPG|frame|center|[http://tinyurl.com/2go39m See Karl's pad], where the magic happens]]

[[Some argue]] that Karl Rove is untouchable since he does not officially hold a government position and claims that as an "immediate adviser to the president" can't be ordered to testify or appear before Senate Committees that want presidential dirty deeds investigated. 

He constantly hides behind the shield of [[GTFO|"executive privilege"]] which is the power claimed by the president and the executive branch to avoid such things as search warrants and subpoenas by the Senate or Congress. (Funny story: 'executive privilege' is not mentioned in the Constitution).

==Pwned==
[[Image:Rove-pwnt.jpg|thumb|[[pwn|OWN3D!]]]]
On November 7th, 2006, Karl was officially [[pwned]] when his much (self) vaunted [[unwarranted self-importance|political acumen]] handed control of the US Senate and House to the [[Democrats]] for the first time [[at least 100|since 1994]].

Nevertheless, Karl still had enough [[brain|acumen]] left to know a [[W|sinking ship]] when he sees one and so in August 2007 he donned his [[fursona|rat fursuit]] and deserted the administration before it's totally sunk. In a [[bullshit|statement prepared for the media]] he said: 

{{quote|I just think it's time. There's always something that can keep you here, and as much as I'd like to be here, I've got to do this for the sake of my family|Karl Rove}} 

President Bush responded with a speech of his own:

{{quote|Shit! What the hell am I supposed to do now? I mean, it's not like I really know what the fuck is going on around here . How do I shot gummint!|W}}

[[HAHAHA|Karl will be missed.]]

== Private Life ==

Apart from [[sockpuppet|puppetry and ventriloquism]], Karl Rove is an [[wigger|aficionado]] of the Rap 'sciences' and dabbles in freestyle rapping, breakdancing and [[DJ|cutting it up on the 1 & 2s]] whenever he is afforded the opportunity. When he gets the chance to [[rap|"buss a rhyme"]] he assumes the identity of '''MC Rove''' (aka ''' DJ Turd Blossom''').
