StarForce
'''StarForce''' is very devastating and the only legal [[virus]] in the world. It was designed in secret laboratories in [[Russia]] during the [[Cold War]] and spread by greedy publishing companies via good [[video games]].

== Effects ==
StarForce is designed to annoy and create [[chaos]] in [[computer]]s and their owners' lives. It also mutates living organisms. Some of the customers are complaining about it in StarForce [http://www.star-force.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=1149 tech supports forums], but their [[moderator]]s just ignore them, close their threats and state that StarForce is only a [[harmless]] copy protection measure.
