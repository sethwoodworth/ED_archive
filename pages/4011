== Incomplete Guy ==


[[Image:Incomplete Guy Original.png|thumb|Original Incomplete Guy]]Incomplete guy was created on 07/18/09 on the well known image board [[4chan]] in the random board section otherwise known as the [[goatse|infamous]] /b/. The entire retardedness of the picture to be edited was [[ejaculation|overwhelming]]. An [[fetish|armless legless]] figure with a frown upon his brow was the picture presented to the many tards that inhabit /b/ little did anyone know about the [[cancer|shop-storm]] that was about to hit.

Incomplete guy is [[pointless|useful]] for a number of [[rule 34|things]], he can be [[rape|exploited]] to credit something with total and complete utter fail or alternatively used to [[handjob|point out]] things you would like and don't have, like [[penis|pussy]].

== New Meme Created ==

[[Image:Incomplete Guy archieved.JPG|thumb|Pic or it didn't happen]]
The [[spam|content]] OP uploaded [[insecure|may not have been the most original]] but it was [[stupid|so easy]] to try and create something funny from the [[lolwut|amazing]] image. A [[retarded]] mutated Chernobyl baby could have meant epic [[lolcow|lulz]]. What followed was a [[fail|tidal wave]] of edited pics containing the face from the original [[exactly|13kb .png]] image. 
No matter how many people claimed it was the cancer killing /b/ and claimed it was not OC it managed to get archived so it can be left and forgotton about over time. The oldfags had a bit of a bitch but it was generally agreed that the thread was epic bread and not copy pasta failness like the rest of /b/ so Incomplete Guy became a new [[meme]] that newfags and trollfags alike can repost and repost until everyone is sick of it and move onto something else

== How to be Original ==
How to be original is an ability that the people of the internet lack. Here is a guide to being original to help you on your way to creating a better Incomplete Guy than everyone else.

* Don't take someone elses idea and copy paste it, chances are if you liked it and copy pasta everyone else will be doing the same.

* Everything is the cancer get over it and either join in or go away. Hurr Durr this is the cancer is more unoriginal and pointless than the thread itself.

* Incomplete guy opens himself to making otherwise fail memes like milhouse actually a little better so to use incomplete guy in another meme can hold its merits just be a little original about it

* If your idea is lame don't post it, no one will care. I don't care, you won't care, the woman over there won't care, the janitor won't care, your cat won't care either just don't post it that goes for anything.

* Memes are selected not forced, forcing memes is lame and if you have to force it its probably not funny. Therefore Incomplete Guy is a product of natural selection and therefore better than you.
