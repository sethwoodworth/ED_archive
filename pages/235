'''Adobe[[retard|®]] Photoshop[[retard|®]]''' is the [[internet]]'s [[winnar|premier photo editing software]]. Its very advanced features, [[Lies|present in no other image manipulation software]], allow you to perform complex tasks such as creating desktop wallpapers of your favorite Anime characters and [[Internet disease|airbrushing]] your [[webcam]] pictures to remove rolls of fat and pimples.

Nobody knows how much Adobe® Photoshop® costs or how Adobe® can still make money because nobody has ever actually purchased a copy of it before. Every copy of Adobe® Photoshop® in use today is actually the same [[pirate|pirated]] copy that has been in circulation for several years.

If you wish to indicate that an image has been altered using the Adobe® Photoshop® program, the only acceptable way of saying so is as follows:
[[this looks shopped|"This image seems as though it has been enhanced with Adobe® Photoshop® software."]] The term "photoshopped" is incorrect and a [http://www.adobe.com/misc/trade.html#section-4 violation of the Adobe® Photoshop® trademark].



==Photoshop® Contests==

Recent versions of Adobe® Photoshop® have [[at least 100|approximately 97 million]] features. Exactly two of them (Rotate Canvas and Auto Levels) are actually useful for touching up your [[n00dz|vacation pictures]]. The only [[legitimate]] use for the approximately 96,999,998 other features is to enter a "Photoshop® contest." Whoever spends hours making the best fake photograph [[You Win the Prize|wins the prize]]. Since the only advantage of photography over drawing is that it's faster and more accurate, this practice is unbelievably [[stupid]]. 

Riding on the coattails of their program's massive success, the creators at Adobe® thought that it would be interesting to start up their own competition with the people who use Photoshop®. They sent out e-mails to the people that actually registered the program to explain the rules. The ten people with registered copies worked day and night. No one won the competition, many [[Baw|bawwed]] and Adobe® ran away from the competition ideas that they had.
