Placeholder
<center>[[Image:Placeholder.jpg|thumb|600px|Artist's rendition of what a Placeholder might look like. Note the header image's reuse within the article body.]]</center>

Got an idea for an article, but can't be bothered to actually put any work into research? Want to be funny, but aren't? Got one example of a meme, but don't want to download more, upload them to ED and correctly format them into a gallery? Not banned, and want to be banned?

My friend, a placeholder article may be just the solution for you!

==How Do I Tell If My Article Is A Placeholder?==

*If your article contains one exploitable posted in a gallery, it is most likely a placeholder and runs the risk of deletion.
*If your article consists of a single sentence, usually along the likes of "KAREN DISTEFANO IS A STUK UP BICH WHO POSTS ON YOUTUEB AAN GOES TO WEST HIGH IN SPRINGFIELD WHEERE SHE IS A STUK UP BICH TO EVERY1," it might be a placeholder or a shitty attack page. Either way, it's getting deleted.
*Was your listed reason for creating the article "Just throwing this out there, other people will contribute," then you're probably a lazy piece of shit trying to sneak a placeholder past the sysops. If you have to specify when you're creating the article that you never intend to do any work on it then it is overwhelmingly unlikely that other people will want to do so on your behalf, [[USI|your highness.]]

==When Is It Appropriate To Use A Placeholder?==

*If [[Jessi Slaughter]] was making out with [[Boxxy]] and then [[David Miscavige]] burst in shouting [[Allahu Akbar]] and killed them all and the whole internet was shitting pink, bullets of lulz were zipping past everyone's head and there was no information available, it would be OK to put up a page to get the ball rolling with a placeholder.
*If you find that ED is missing an article on a very well known internet phenomenon or meme (say, for example, you were suddenly to realise that there was no article for [[Mudkips]]), we'd probably look the other way.

==What Should I Do If I Use A Placeholder?==

*Consider putting it in your User Space. Let's say LazyFaggot wants to make an article about Ubuntu 10.04. Instead of making an article called <nowiki>[[Ubuntu_10.04]] he makes one called [[User:LazyFaggot/Ubuntu_10.04]]. </nowiki> This tells sysops that the article is work in progress and not to delete it while it is being made ready for the primetime.
*Go to the [[Thizzlehat Junction Center]] and post a request for help researching your topic.
*[[Get on IRC]] and ask for help in #wiki.

==What Happens When I Post A Placeholder?==

*99 times out of 100, it gets deleted.
*100 times out of 100, [[PieAreSquare]] flies to your house on his rocket-powered jetski and kills you and everyone you love with a fucking tyre iron.
