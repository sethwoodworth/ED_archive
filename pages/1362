Cash Items
Cash items are items you obtain on [[Gaia Online]] by [[Serious Business|wasting your money on]], that you could instead use it to get [[Atleast 100|atleast 100 gallons]] of gas on but instead sent the fucks at least $100 because you wanted to get those "awesome pixels" for your [[Shit|"awesome avatar"]]! Unlike the [[Monthly Collectibles]], all the items are complete shit and nobody cares about them. However Gaiafags like em because it's what they wanted and that they're GAIAFAGS.

Items range from .25Â¢ - $9.99

== [[Pokemon|Evolution Items]] ==
The developers of Gaia decided to give the oldfags the finger and make items that transform periodically. This caused a major shitstorm as many gaiafags not only believed they were similar to monthly collectibles (looking more detailed, having multiple ways to wear them, and being generally more weeaboo-tastic than other items), but took it as a way for the staff to just get moar moneys off them (see [[Gaia Online#Gaia Drama|Gaia Drama]]). [[Lie|Over 9000 users later quit FOREVAR]]. [[Shit nobody cares about|Some are now considering about starting a revolution on the site, for the faggots feel that the staff members dont give a shit about them but their money instead.]]

== Lulz from Gaia Developers ==
Last thursday one of the evolving items (The [[shit]]ty Bottle, an item made very popular by Narutards) made its final transformation and turned into a sword that made [[over 9000]] Gaiafags [[BAWW]] over its pixellated shit of fail. Some fags didn't believe this was real but after at least 100 complaints they finally accepted it. However, some Gaiafags now use this as an [[bullshit|example]] of Gaia's faggotry when bitching about something, they will frequently be heard saying things like; "DIS FEATUR SUKS! IT SUKS AS MUTCH AS DA BAWWWWWTLES FINAL FORM!!!1!!11!".
