'''[[Patrick Bateman|Philip Markoff]]''' aka '''The Craigslist Killer''' (or '''sexaddict53885''' to his pals on dozens of [[fetish]] sites) was an [[yuppie|educated, upwardly mobile, handsome, young white]] med student/panty aficionado from [[Boston]] who enjoyed chains, collars, leashes and experimentation with transvestites on gayclublist.com, passion.com extremerestrain.com and alt.com.
 
The former [[rapist|medical student]] was in a Boston jail cell awaiting trial in the shooting death of a "[[hooker|masseuse]]" he ordered up on [[Craigslist]] in April 2009 and some other [[SNCA|deviant shit only hooker huggers care about]], when he allegedly [[an hero]]'d by stabbing himself in the jugular with a pen <b>''and''</b> suffocating himself with a plastic bag over the head on the day that would have been his first anniversary if his bitch fiance hadn't called off their wedding upon learning that Philip was a [[sick fuck]]. 

However, [[tinfoil hat|truth seekers]] believe that the young scientist was being persecuted by [[The Man]] for his [[human Centipede|daring and cutting edge research]] into the genetic sequence of sex workers and was arrested and jailed to silence him when he stumbled across the hooker's client list which was comprised primarily of [[John F. Kennedy|Boston's political elite]]. 

According to Boston PD, he used a jail-issued pen shaved into a surgically sharp razor to sever his femoral artery and ankles. He wrote his victim's name on the wall in his own blood -- m-e-g-a-n -- as he choked to death. He also attempted to write a second word in blood -- er, what looked like "pocket", but was unable to finish.

== The Facts ==
{{quote|-- like you wouldn't think of him being a card carrying member of the [[KKK]]. But he was someone who had issues with [[black|people of color]], had issues with women."|A [[asshole|friend]]}}
On [[An hero day|April 20, 2009]], Boston police arrested Philip Markoff of Quincy, [[Massachusetts]] on suspicion of two cases of assault and [[robbery]] and one [[murder]] of a [[hooker|woman]] whose [[sex|services]] were advertised on Craigslist in Boston and [[Rhode Island]].

==Fallout==

Funny enough, Philip was slated to be married and he and his fiance had an on-line album people could sign, and check back for updates. [http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/04/30/Wedding-off-for-accused-Craigslist-killer/UPI-53821241129688/ The wedding] is [[Captain_Obvious|now off.]]

Phil tells it like it is:

And his 'friends' chime in, showing admirable mental clarity:

When news came out that Philip spent his free time robbing and killing hookers to support his gambling habit, people tuned in:
