'''Too long; didn't read'''. Initialism used in response to a writer that doesn't know when to [[KISS|shut the fuck up.]] Most of what is found on [[LiveJournal]] is considered [[Unwarranted self importance|TL;DR.]] Notable examples of this facepalmingly annoying writing trend include The Holy [[Bible|Babble,]] everything ever written by [[vagina|Bill O'Reilly]], and most of [[Encyclopedia dramatica|Encyclopedia Dramatica.]] TL;DR in all forms is a [[ban]]nable offense on the [[Something Awful]] forums.

The polar opposite of TL;DR is [[TS;DR]], which nobody fucking uses.

Barnes & Noble's [[interweb]] site SparkNotes tries to fight TL;DR syndrome in books and shit, but their summaries are usually just as long and boring as the [[Sauce|source]] material, because they are mostly written by pretentious fucks who wish they could write novels themselves instead of just summarizing them.  

If you're ever in a [[verbose thread]] and you STILL want to say "TL;DR," you're [[doing it wrong]] -- but oddly enough, in any OTHER context you can use an expanded version of "TL;DR" to great effect, as in the following example:

"After the 12th paragraph, I started getting light-headed, and had to stop and set up a base camp to rest while the Sherpas went ahead to scout out the rest of the post. But after a long nap and some serious re-hydration, I was able to push through and finish my ascent. I don’t know that I’ve ever been more proud of myself."

==How can TL;DR help me?==
Despite the negative connotation TL;DR usually has, it can also be used to one's advantage.  If your teacher assigns you a paper on some boring-ass topic like the [[Truth|Whiskey Rebellion of 1791,]] you know that bitch isn't gonna read every single paper in your 500 seat lecture class, so you can just fire up the [[copypasta]] machine and make your paper so long and boring that she'll get about 3 pages in before giving up and scribbling a  "B" on it before running off to some seedy motel with one of her other students. 

While you could ctrl-c and ctrl-v real facts from a [[Wikipedia|reliable source]], it may be easier just to paste the same information [[THE BEST|over and over again]] to take up space.

==Supermemoing as an extreme anti-TL;DR countermeasure==
[[Image:Ayn rand tldr.jpg|thumb|Obvious]]
If some asshole presents to you a long text and you still need to read it, you can incrementally read it with [[SuperMemo]]. What this entails is you mince and flashcardize the shit out of the text until it gets obliterated and you can't recognize it. It's like throwing the piece of e-paper in acid. The TL;DR is no moar.

== On TL;DR ==
{{quote|1=Just yesterday, I used this in lowercase (thinking of this conversation) and it didn't raise any eyebrows. However, the general Wiktionary convention has been to put abbreviations, acronyms and initialisms in their upper-case form whenever it can be both. (Not sure why, and less sure that the same rule should be applied to Internet-isms.) OTOH, it is something of a gargantuan stretch to say that "tldr" is part of the general English lexicon (which used to be one criterion for inclusion.) Still, except for your examples, I haven't seen it with the semicolon. Perhaps different cliques use if differently? 4chan, especially, I'd think, would pride themselves in using a more 133t variant, than is generally accepted. One other note, is that punctuation in a headword is always problematic (if not here, then downstream.) When the punctuation-less variant also exists (and especially when it seems to be more common) the unadorned version should have precedence, perhaps with an alternative spellings mention and/or a soft redirect from the punctuated version.|2=Connel MacKenzie on TL;DR [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:TLDR at wiktionary.] (See also [[irony]]).}}
