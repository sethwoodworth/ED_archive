'''Joe Mathlete''' runs one of the best blogs in the world. How could a blog be good you ask? Well, it's not a blog that whines about [[Democrats]]/[[Republicans]]/[[Religion]]/[[America]], rather it's one making fun of famously unfunny comic, Marmaduke. Originally running on [http://marmadukeexplained.blogspot.com blogspot.com], Joe has since moved to [http://www.29-95.com/users/joe-mathlete 29-95.com] after a long hiatus. Because of his hotlinking of a comics site that throws images out after 30 days, Mathlete's comics from [[666|June 6, 2006]] til July 30, [[2006]] [[;_;|have been lost]]. The formula is pretty simple, Joe posts a Marmaduke comment and then explains its subtle humor for the sake of everyone being able to enjoy this wonderful comic.

{{squote|1=I have received a number of emails about the missing images from the first month or so of this blog. When I first began this public service, I linked the cartoons from United Media's website (which is very similar to this blog, only it just posts the comic strips without giving them proper context). Then I figured out that after a month they switch out all of the Marmaduke comics with pictures of a little red X, most likely to piss off bloggers and the like.|2=Joe Mathlete|3=[http://marmadukeexplained.blogspot.com/2006/09/dear-marmaduke-explanation-enthusiasts.html]}}

Like [[married to the sea|many]] [[electric retard|other]] [[morning glory|webcomics]] [[lego robot comics|in]] the lollersphere, Marmaduke Explained can be extremely polarizing. [[Sheneequa|I]] might find it hilarious while [[everyone|you]] might [[uncyclopedia|not get it]]. Either way, here's some examples.

Presumably his owners were willing to carry out such an asinine request because of how enormously impressive it must have been for a dog to communicate such a specific desire.

''[http://marmadukeexplained.blogspot.com/2006/08/marmaduke-attempts-to-trade-his-owner.html]'']]|[[File:Marmaduke2003053760816.gif|center|300px|thumb|Marmaduke is trying to let his owner-lady know that he wants to fuck her.

Remember when Grandma tried to feed her poop to the cat? Yeah...<br /><br />

Don't be sad, though: Marmaduke creator Brad Anderson will be with God soon, and that's what we need to focus on in times like these.

As Marmaduke is a dog, and dogs consider bones to be very important and valuable, he no doubt was being earnest and generous in his offer, but the delivery boy has not encountered such before.<br /><br />

(A lesser strip would have pointed out the absurdity in a dog ordering pizza ("how can such a thing be?!?"), but the humor in ''Marmaduke'' is much more subtle and layered to settle for such an obvious chuckle. In the Marmadukiverse (c), this sort of shit happens all the time) ''[http://marmadukeexplained.blogspot.com/2006/09/marmaduke-ordered-pizza-from-2-ur-door.html]'']]|[[File:Marmaduke2040718060912.png|thumb|center|300px|Marmaduke planned on eating dinner with his fat, elderly neighbors, but they are having something he doesn't like to eat and he flips a shit.

II) Marmaduke does not know how to properly operate a jump rope (causation: Marmaduke is a dog)<br /><br />

III) Marmaduke creator Brad Anderson refers to jump ropes as "skip ropes" (causation: Brad Anderson has not paid attention to current parlance since 1948) ''[http://marmadukeexplained.blogspot.com/2006/10/special-three-part-installment-i.html]'']]|[[File:Marmaduke2006111110625.gif|thumb|center|300px|Marmaduke is committing so many different breaches in drive-thru protocol at the local Pic-Up Burger that I don't even know where to begin.
