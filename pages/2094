David L. Smith
'''David L. Smith''' a.k.a. '''[[The Simpsons|Kwyjibo]]''' is the man responsible for the release of the single most costly [[virus|worm]] in the history of the internets to that point. He did it totally [[for the lulz]], and when he got caught by [[the man]], he [[????|somehow managed]] to reduce his time served by [[Profit|getting a job working for the FBI]].

==Anatomy of a [[Cock|Worm]]==
[[Image:kwyjibo.jpg|right|thumb|[[Old meme]].]]
Smith developed something called the <i>[[cunt|Melissa]] [[AIDS|macrovirus]]</i>. <i>Melissa</i> - sometimes identified as a worm because of the way it [[Mexicans|unwantedly invades your shit and endlessly propagates]] - was developed as a harmless [[prank]] that would spread via [[Microsoft]] [[Office]]. The virus would first [[anal|enter via Outlook]] and spread to your .doc files. Once there it would insert the following text, cribbed from a Simpson's episode where Bart was playing Scrabble and put down the nonsense word "kwyjibo":
{{quote|twenty-two, plus triple-word score, plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game’s over. I’m outta here|[[The Simpsons]], [[Old|SE1, EP2]], <i>Bart The Genius</i>}}
While the virus was busy [[raping]] your documents, it was also busy [[STD|spreading the love to your friends]] via Outlook.

*Fun [[Fact]] - Melissa was [[allegedly]] named after a stripper Smith met in [[Florida]]. No matter how bad you feel getting the Melissa worm, at least [[you]] aren't a [[Irony|stripper with a virus named after her]].

==Melissa Grows Teeth==
Smith released his virus onto the [[Masturbation|alt.sex]] [[Usenet]] group in March of 1999. Within hours it had spread across the internet. Within a week it's estimated to have infected at least [[Over 9000|100,000]] systems worldwide. Final estimates stated that about a half-million people got the virus.

At some point the virus evolved. [[Script kiddies]] who wanted to [[Attention whore|make themselves famous]] had modified the virus into several different, extremely nasty variations, including:
*Melissa.U
**Melissa.U would come barging into your computer like a [[Irish|town drunkard]] looking for a fight. It would then pummel your critical system files like command.com, removing them and any associated archive files.
*Melissa.V
**This nasty fucker would attempt to [[delete fucking everything]] from a number of drives on your computer and network. When it was done, it would then display the message <i>"[[PROTIP|Hint]]: Get [[I GOT NORTON!|Norton 2000]] not McAfee 4.02"</i>.

Corporations watched their mail servers attempt to cope with the massive loads of traffic generated by the worm. One by one they [[fail]]ed, caving in to the rising [[crapflood]]. Thousands of documents were corrupted and lost in the process. Hundreds of companies were forced offline, losing millions in revenue in the process. Affected companies included [[Microsoft]] (a fact compounded that virtually everyone at Microsoft uses Outlook and Word), Lockheed-Martin, Lucent, and Intel.

==David Smith Today==
Smith evaded the police for a month, but they easily tracked him down through his [[AOL]] account to Aberdeen, [[New Jersey]]. Smith was arrested without any incident at his brother's house. Smith was one of the first people ever to be prosecuted for developing a virus. He could have faced forty years in [[jail]], instead he was sentenced to ten.

Smith had an ingenious idea at this point. He had shown the government how dangerous a modern computer worm could be. Now he could lend his expertise in the field to the [[FBI]]. Soon he was working forty-hour weeks for the feds, ratting out his old [[hacker]] friends while staying far enough below the radar that they couldn't tell it was him. The [[FBI]] got his sentence reduced to 20 months and a $5,000 fine.

To this day Smith prowls the [[internet]], [[Seaking|seeking]] out the perpetrators of internet-related crime. Fuck him.
