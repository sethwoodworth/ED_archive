Jay Mariotti
[[Image:Jay_Mariotti.jpg|center]]

'''Jay Mariotti''' is a former a sportswriter for the Chicago Sun-Times and a national columnist for Fanhouse.com. Known paisano, mother of four, [[mediacrat]], judo instructor, collegiate mascot, and Woody [[h8r]], Mariotti was a regular on ESPN's Around the Horn. It is presumed that he may be a [[wizard]], capable of turning himself invisible and appearing at places such as the [[Baseball|White Sox]] [[Glory_hole|Clubhouse]] in 2004 where he claimed to be present but no one could see him. This might also be evidence that Jay Mariotti [[The_Game|does not exist]]. He has been accused of [[faggotry]] by White Sox manager [[Mexican|Ozzie Guill√©n]].

==ON TEH INTERNETZ==

In July 2010, Deadspin.com contributor A.J. Daulerio apparently [[cockblocked]] a guy to deceive some [[whore|nice young lady]] into divulging private details of her converstaion with ESPN [[An_Hero|An Hero]] Jay Mariotti. (NOTE: The following has been edited for greater [[lulz]] although the context remains unchanged.)

AJD: Spill, please<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: I knew about around the horn, whatever, but I certainly didn't know or care who was on it<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: I pretty much told all of this to mariotti who goes off on how he has a huge cock
and how he relates to players because of it and he fears cameras and photos taken of him in clubs just like black people in the NFL<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: and how he can't be spotted with alcoholic beverages (like the one he was holding. lol) because ESPN would ream him out<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: and how it's really tough to be so well known and famous<br />
AJD: Surriously!?<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: and have everyone up in your grill<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: he's divorced and got my number<br />
AJD: LULZ!<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: You cannot post this conversation anywhere!<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: CANNOT!!! ....<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: I would NEVAR EVAR EVAR EVAR EVARRRRRRRRR hook up with him but I was high as fuck<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: besides I think he had a girlfriend there<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: some blonde [furry]<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: anyway... so we talked for quite some time and he's going on about his schedule, how he films 250,000 days a year<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: and how [the itching] gets so intense.<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: and he makes me WATCH A [GOATSE] CLIP OF HIM ON HIS PHONE<br />
AJD: MOAR!<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: I am not making this up.<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: okay, now I feel like a gossiping bitch. Am I being a gossiping bitch?<br />
KUMDUMPSTA2: I sort of am. LOLZ!<br />
AJD: Not at all! but...<br />
AJD: Guess what? I lied. I'm going to post this on the web, you gossiping bitch!<br />

==LOLWUT?==

In November of 2009, Mariotti was lurking in a poor effort to seduce [[women|wimmins]] at an underground nightclub in [[Chicago]] when he was [[sodomy|sodomized]] and thrown out of the club by an [[black|NFL]] [[fag|linebacker]] with an even bigger [[cock|lap rocket]] for [[violence|assaulting]] a kid for taking his picture without his permission.

Spotted with two [[whore|wh0res]], Jay saw the [[Newfag|kid]] taking his picture with a cell phone and decided it was time to [[cheerleader|B.E. Agressive]]. Chasing the kid down he tried to steal the phone in question as the kid screamed "get the fuck away from me....i didn't take your picture loser. lol" A swarm of securiteh manhandled Mariotti to the ground missionary style before making him bite the curb. He began proclaiming himself an innocent victim of media rape and then used his [[magic|powers]] to curse the owner of the club who no longer remembers the incident.

==Surprise Sex==

It has been reported that Jay Mariotti was arrested on August 21, 2010 on charges of domestic [[violence]]. His attourney claims that the accusations made by the accuser, Mariotti's girlfriend, are completely false and that she did it for the [[lulz]]. However, it is likely that Jay Mariotti will soon end up in [[prison]] where he will be almost raped, then later raped by Plaxico Burress who by this time might literally be [[butthurt]].
