A '''Gun''' is a potentially very effective line-of-sight [[IRL]] [[Ban hammer|banhammer]], often deployed by [[Erectile Dysfunction|impotent]] [[Wanker|wankers]] who are [[butthurt]] because they won't get what they want through [[Work|hard work]], [[intelligence]], [[love]], [[creativity]], enterprise or other human virtues, and want to act out their frustration and inadequacy through IRL [[Troll|trolling]] and [[Pwn|pwning]] others. 
'''Guns''' are what [[Americunts]] have instead of [[penis]]es, while britfags (the major proponents of [[gun control]]) are forced to suffer through their penile reality by taking [[ketamine|party drugs]] and drowning themselves in tea and crumpets.  The [[Internet]] has a huge guns, weapons and military related subculture, with numerous websites catering for all [[fetish|preferences]]. Some are filled to the brim with [[13 year old boys|16 year olds]] who don't have a fucking clue and generally just spout the latest bullshit from ''Future Weapons'', the weapons menu on ''Counter-Strike'', ''Modern Warfare 2'', or the latest article from ''Soldier of Fortune'' if they are really advanced. Below is your guide to this delightful phenomenon.

==Controversy==
There are four types of people:
:* [[Rednecks|Cool people]] who understand that the right to own guns is [[awesome]]
:* Idiots who believe the above are compensating for tiny dicks and demand that [[Fascist|only the army and police be allowed to have guns]]
:* Non-idiots who actually use guns, and know that both of the above are [[correct]] at times
:* People from countries other than the USA, who think that Americans are the funniest people in the world, particularly when it comes to guns.

<B>The Brady Bill</B>: The Brady Handgun Lulz Prevention Act, more commonly known as "The Brady Bill", was put into place in 1993 after [[Troll|John Hinckley Jr.]] tried to kill Reagen. His press secretary, Jim Brady got in the way of this very lulzy act and was [[retard|left paralyzed]]. Common consensus is that he deserved it. Proving that they have no sense of humor, Congress then put into place this act which would require a background check on firearms purchasers and a waiting period for handguns. These provisions have prevented any [[Columbine|subsequent]] [[Virginia_Tech_Massacre|tragedies]] of [[Fort_Hood|any]] kind whatsoever. [[Lie|Democracy works!]]. Gun Nuts have a strange sexual relationship with this act, because on the one hand it takes away their rights!!!one!!!OMG11!. But on the other they tried to kill their god Reagen, who can do no wrong in their books, and because he signed this act into law, it must be obeyed, even if stricken down by later acts of congress.

==The Way of the Gun==

Guns were made by [[Jesus]] Christ after realizing his favorite country, the United States, needed something to spread the gospel to [[Indian|savages]]. Jesus himself invented the first gun, and armed with the power of [[Christianity]], and a factory of [[India]]n sweatshop workers, to bring peace and justice to the free world, by ridding us of the lesser races and [[Muslims|non-believers]].

<div class="content1"><div style="border:1px solid #CCCCCC; padding:8px">'''Rifles''' are a common and extremely difficult to conceal type of gun. Used to assasinate presidents by [[Terrorists|freedom fighters]], to [[pwn]] animals by [[rednecks]] and to [[murder|silence]] [[Arabs]] by [[Israeli]] and [[United States]] soldiers.

====M16====

The M16 is the iconic weapon of the red-blooded [[KKK|'murricun]]. If you carry this piece you are out on a holy crusade to end the lives of all communists, [[Irony|Nazis]], [[Democrat]]s, towel-heads, evolutionary biologists, Jews, and the occasional [[Catholic]], 'cause we all know those Mary-worshipers have it coming. 

During development, the M16 was picked up by the U.S. Army which was struggling because potheads, the primary demographic for recruitment in the 1960s, couldn't handle the [[3Guys1Hammer|hammering recoil]] of the M14. The M16A1 model helped resolve that problem by introducing a rifle that wouldn't fire at all. The A2 and A3 incarnations solved the reliability problems but introduced one of the worst [[fail|features]] in modern firearms which quickly started showing up on every other assault rifle and SMG, the 3-round burst. Originally intended to save ammo and increase accuracy over a fully automatic fire mode, the 3-round burst was devised for those not smart enough to figure out that you don't have to go [[batshit]] and hold the trigger till the gun don't fire no mo'. The civilian version is the semi-auto AR-15. It's one of the cheapest (can be had for less than $1000), most popular ([[wincest|inbred]] [[rednecks]] love it), most accurate (many can shoot sub 1 MOA out of the box), most common (It seems like Christ and Everybody makes AR-15s, there are [[Over 9000 |A LOT]] of AR-15 makers out there), and most modular semi-auto rifles used by [[Americunts]]. Many people who buy AR-15s then trick them out with scopes, foregrips, flashlights, and vibrators [[Fail|just to shoot at empty beer cans]] because they're hillbillies [[oxymoron|too stupid to join the military]]. When an AR-15 faggot is describing his weapon, you can be sure it will result in an immediate [[Sleep|snorefest]]. The M16 is so prolific there have been many offshoots of the design, some of the most notable being the .50-caliber Beowulf slug launcher, many chambered in 7.62mm NATO, target shooting conversions for .22LR, foreign modifications like the [[Nazi]] HK416.

If you mention the M16/AR-15 on most gun boards or forums you'll spark a [[flame war]] more [[Extreme|intense]] than the one that killed the [[Waco|Branch Davidians]]. [[troll|Bonus points]] if you tell them they are all wrong and the M16 should have been chambered in .30-06, have a 100-round drum, and fire full auto.

====AK-47====
[[Image:Hawkins Mall Shooter.jpg|thumb|left|The AK-47 can be a formidable weapon in the [[Robert Hawkins|right hands]]]]

Designed to be easily used by child soldiers and [[niggers|poorly trained conscripts]], the AK-47 was spread throughout the world by Tony Stark in a cave. The rifle is simple in construction and fairly robust, using a gas-piston made to looser tolerances than [[your mom|any other gas-piston rifle]] out there. It has great popularity amongst, well, [[Communist]]s, [[terrorist]]s, and [[anon|guys that want to spree-kill their neighbors]]. And [[Colton Tooley|college Sophomores]].  Most that you'll come across in real life are [[China|Chinese]] or Eastern European knock-offs, actual [[Russia]]n models being rare. The AK can be found wherever there are angry Arab and [[gooks]]. It's the single best way to ruin GIs [[IRL]]. The AK-47 is the most well known firearm in the world and is a symbol of both freedom and opression by [[niggers|those dumb enough]] to live in [[africa|third world countries]]. [[Shit nobody cares about|Actually, faggots, the AK-47 is an obscure early model, nowhere near as popular as the later AKM variant. Almost 99.8% of the AK-47s you see worldwide are in fact AKMs, distinguished by the stamped and riveted sheet metal receiver and muzzle compensator.]] The more you know...

AK-47 vs. M16 threads are woefully common in any weapons-related forum. The usual crap of accuracy vs. reliability is rehashed and fucked up for yet another inning. On many websites, Military Photos and AR-15.com notably, this kind of crap will get you raped by the [[Banhammer|admins]]. You deserve it, you little bastard, because no self-respecting [[Banhammer]] will tolerate under-deodorized [[13 year old boys]] bitching about [[Shit nobody cares about|the M-16 being so much more ''accurate'' than the AK-47 or the AK-47 being so much more ''durable'' than the M16]]. Either way, both guns can still clear a middle school classroom faster than kicking down the door and shouting "Immigration and Customs Enforcement!" at a [[Spics|LULAC]] meeting.

====Aks-74u====
This is a miniature version of the AK-47's modern equivalent, the AK-74. It's small enough to fit in your jeans pocket and to be carried one-handed. Perfect for school shootings, because it will give you street cred, even if you're a [[Wigger]] (and you are). Also good for drive-by's due to its compact size, the AKS-74U is every [[Gangster]]'s dream. and, of course, the ultimate Arab Osama Bin Frickin' Laden carries one of these babies, ensuring that [[rule 34]] applies even in a cave in Afghanistan.

PROTIP: Just because the dumbfucks who made Call of Duty 4 call this a submachine gun does NOT make it an actual submachine gun. The AKs-74u fires the same 5.45x39mm rounds as the AK-74, making it an assault rifle.

====SVD====
[[Image:Svd2c.JPG|right|thumb|Keep dreaming...]]
Like the M14, but tailor made for the same poorly trained 3rd world child armies that employ the AK-47. Except the ones that get SVDs are the ones that don't have [[ADHD]] and actually paid attention and tried during target practice at Camp Durka. Also holds the title of '''Biggest Life Ruiner Of American Soldiers 1963-2009''', largely in part due to [[Juba the Baghdad Sniper]]. However, Since [[Bill Clinton]] thought that genuine Russian-made arms like SVDs, original AKs and even the chink bootleg versions were [[This is why we can't have nice things|nice things]], which means we can't have them, SVDs are really rare and even chink copies go for [[Over 9000|over $3000]] which means you and your [[Call of Duty 4|COD4]] buddies have a snowball's chance in hell of getting one and will have to settle for a Romanian PSL, which is basically a cheap AK with a long barrel and spiffy buttstock.

====M14 Rifle====
[[Image:M14_is_porn.jpg|right|thumb|Hawt]]

Before the sweet-sixteen there was the the M14, a beastly [[inbred|pure-bred]] American piece made of wood, iron, and cock. If you don't mind the fact it kicks like a date-rape scene gone horrible wrong then you can't go wrong with its 7.62x51mm NATO truck stopping power. If a sand Mexican is having himself a little pow-wow with roasted marshmallows and sing-alongs behind that reinforced sandbag teepee, and your 5.56x45mm NATO ain't cutting it, never fear! Your M14 will punch right through that sandwiched dirt and give Haji a splintering sensation of our constitutional right to kick ass, take names - and lunch money in some cases - even if their names are written in squiggly lines. Just don't mistake it for a machine gun.

Unfortunately, the U.S. military made this mistake by implementing a full-auto function for this gun. The powerful kick of the 7.62x51mm ammunition caused such massive muzzle climb, even when fired in bursts, that soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam couldn't hit gooks in full auto, even when they were executing villagers at point blank range. Because of this, despite the M14's major [[pwnage]] potential, it was replaced by the pussy-recoil M16 as a standard issue rifle.

Like the climax of every Disney sports movie, the M14 has made a sudden comeback, sans full-auto capability. With the rise of [[Chris Benoit|anabolic steroids]] and a need to [[Headshot|spread democracy]] at ranges exceeding 400 meters, the M14 has met a revival for snipers and designated marksmen in the lulzfests of Afghanistan and [[Iraq]]. With generations of retards raised on [[counterstrike]] and a whole desert full of people in need of some [[death|democracy]], the future for this once forgotten rifle looks brighter than ever!

====FN FAL====
[[Image:FALfail.jpg|right|thumb|DO NOT WANT]]
The [[democracy|right arm of the free world]]. This rifle killed communists, [[Africa|savages]] and communist savages throughout the Cold War, and is still being used by dirt poor countries that [[war|we gave democracy to]]. Ironic, since it was made by the friendly [[Capitalist]] [[Belgium|waffle-humpers]] at Fabrique Nationale who stole most of the design from the Russian SVT-40. Its XBOX HUEG 7.62x51mm round makes an example of every Russian, Arab, nigger, hippie, gook, Argie and protester that gets in its way.

====H&K G3====
Conceived by the God-like Aryan engineers during the closing months of World War 2, then stolen by the Spanish, then stolen back again by the Teutons, the Gewehr 3 was designed from the ground up to kill anyone politically left-of-center. Chambered in the massively [[WIN]] 7.62x51mm NATO round, this gun combines advanced mechanical concepts and the crude ability to open up a bush nigger's head like a ripe watermelon at an impressive 600 meters. Used by most nations of the civilized world who wanted a 1.) rifle that wasn't designed by those dirty Belgians and 2.) had it's roots in the Third Reich. HEIL HITLER! 14/88!

====Mauser K98k====
This bolt-action rifle was mass-produced by the [[Nazis]] to waste [[jews]] and it did so rather effectively. It fires [[PWNAGE]] 7.92x57mm Mauser bullets. While it doesn't have the profile of its famous Russian contemporary - the Mosin Nagant - in Amerikkka, it is well famous elsewhere because [[everyone]] has them. It is fairly accurate (which is great for picking off [[jews]] from a balcony) but only carries 5 bullets in the mag. Almost useless for school shootings because they are too slow and will see [[you]] riddled with FBI lead while you reload.

====Mosin Nagant====
[[Image:Mosin troll pwn2.jpg|thumb|right|Trollin IRL with the Mosin.]]

Hated by women, children and anyone within 6 metres of it, the "Moist Nugget's" skull-fucking [http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa38/davidjblythe/BLAST6a.jpg BOOM] is a great way to clear out n00bs and IRL [[troll]] [[pussies|everyone]] at the range.  The Soviets made millions and millions of them during WWII, and as a result you can get them at sporting goods stores in the U.S. for sixty bucks. [[Everyone]] has one, however few can fire them due to the fact that their bolt-action is intended for Popeye-armed [[Russian]] potato farmers. The problem is, the Mosin uses a slightly longer than usual .30-caliber round, so [[Americunts]] often charge their lazers with 7.62x51mm NATO instead of 7.62x54R. Boom! Natural selection continues.

'''Protip:'''  The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simo_Häyhä most successful military sniper of all time, "White Death"], used this gun to rack up over 500 commie kills in the [[Finland|WintAr War]]. He also did this using iron sights... He is [[an hero]] to us all.

====SKS====
[[Image:AmericanSKS.jpg|thumb|God bless 'muricuh.]]
The official mantle-piece of mobile home owners everywhere, the SKS is another Soviet gun developed between a tree stump and the AK-47. While not used much by the Soviets themselves, it was mass produced in [[China]] and was widely used by communist /b/tards around the world. Uses a 7.62x39mm cartridge and the Chinese ones are über-cheap. This gun was also the favorite of the [[gooks]] before they laid their dirty mitts on 'Ks. However, because it doesn't [[pwn]] quite liek the AK it has fallen out of service with most squaddies, except the Russian display teams - who use them for ceremonial purposes and [[fags|ass sex]]. And the shitty Russian SKS only has a 10 round internal magazine, you won't find those that common and instead you'll see the common Chinese Type 56 with detachable magazines.

====Lancer Assault Rifle====
[[Image:lancergun.jpg|thumb|When you simpky cannot pwn enough.]]

JESUS FUCKING CHRIST IT HAS A CHAINSAW ON THE END.


====Sturmgewehr 44====
The worlds first true assault rifle was designed and deployed by the [[nazis|nazis]] in WW2 and was first issued as the MP-43 in 1943. [[Hitler|Hitler]] hated it at first, believing it to be [[ugly|ugly]], Jewish and impractical, [[stupid|and because he had no what a useful gun was supposed to do]] since his days in the [[old|first world war]]. After his troops [[rape|convinced]] him it was a good rifle, he used it as propaganda, renaming it the Sturmgewehr (German for "Assault Rifle"). Odd additions to this weapon were created for [[special|special]] purposes, such as a [[Lolwut|curved barrel that could shoot around corners]] and an infrared night vision sight. If [[moar|more]] were produced at an earlier time, the [[Nazis|Germans]] [[lie|may]] have [[awesome|won the war]]. Mikhail Kalashnikov conceived the AK while recovering from getting pwnt by this rifle in WWII.

====H&K G11====
The most useless assault rifle ever. This gun fired caseless ammunition, which is extremely combat ineffective. These rounds can actually fire by themselfs if the gun overheats, which it constantly does. America built a better version of this, which fixed everything shitty about it, and wanted to use it for a while. However, America still uses the damn M4, even though the new and improved G11 is superior in every way. If you can find one of either version, though, it is probably just a cleverly disguised airsoft gun, as these guns are fucking impossible to find.

</div></div>
<div class="content2"><div style="border:1px solid #CCCCCC; padding:8px">[[Image:Cho seung hui.jpg|thumb|Pistols are known for their superior accuracy at close range]]Smaller guns used for the same reason as the rifle, [[pwning]] just on a smaller scale.



====Colt Model 1911A1====
In 1911, John Moses Browning was deep in prayer when Jesus came forth from heaven bearing the Colt Automaic Pistol Model of 1911. And he did giveth the pistol to John, so that America, his chosen people, could kill colored people all over the globe easier than ever before. This emblem of America brought the USA into the 20th Century as the greatest nation on the planet, by killing Germans, Mexicans, Phillipinos, Nicaraguans, and Haetians with.45 of an inch in righteous hot-lead to the motherfucking sternum. 9mm? America doesn't speak metric, faggot!!!! [[USA|'''USA! USA! USA!''']].

Well, that's what most gun-nuts (as in testicles) will say about it. The pistol is a legend in the [[USA]] due to its long service with the military (about 70 years). And given that no one else in the world is allowed to own weapons, this leads it being the most talked about pistol on the webz0rz. Its  reputation for accuracy stems mainly for it being bought and riced up for use as IPSC race guns rather than any inherent virtue in the design itself. Truth be known, the original service pistol was just a big, heavy, single-action motherfucker that was no more accurate than any other pistol of the time, and was only notable for being the first pistol chambered in the gigantic .45 Automatic Colt Pistol round (ACP). But when you spend $2,000 on aftermarket parts, you can do anything.

[[Image:Budddwyer3.jpg|thumb|left|Budd Dwyer, noted gun enthusiast, shows off his favorite for the cameras]]

==== Beretta 92 a.k.a. M9 ====
The 9mm [[Italy|eye-tie]] gun that finally replaced the ancient and frail 1911. 1911fags hate it because it replaced their antiquated relic, Navy SEALS hate it because it tends to [[pwn|blow up in the face of]] the shooter and glockfags hate it because it beat out their grenade for the coveted position of the gun used to arm soldiers and [[Biggie Smalls]] so he can pull it out and put holes in your sweater and so the soldiers can rape delicious brown girls.   This gun [[lie|was only adopted because the USA wanted military bases in Italy]] and [[capitalism|Beretta made them accept their handgun in return]]. No other gun in the history of mankind has caused so much drama among gunfags. The Beretta is also a great way to behead yourself! Just make sure the slide is at neck level and pull the trigger!

==== Glock ====
R' da bloods movin' in awn 'yo crip territry and ya'll need a piece to pop 'dem niggaz wif? Reach for 'yo GLOCK nigga! Created by [[Josef Fritzl|Austrian]] grenade and curtains manufacturer [[Gaston|Gaston Glock]], the Glock was widely adopted by niggers the world over for its ease of use while aiming sideways. Glocks are now used as much by wannabe badboy cops as they are niggers. Glocks, being standard issue to cops, niggers and mafiosi, are therefore owned by [[everyone]].  [[Cho|The Blazn Azn]] used one at his time at VTech!

==== Springfield XD ====

The anti-Glock, fixing everything the glock fails at; like exploding when shot. Actually a [[Nazi|Croatian]] pistol called the "HS2000", the American company Springfield Armory just [[capitalism|stole the design]] and called it the "XD". A lot of [[Counter-strike]] and [[Call of Duty 4]] [[13 year old boys|players]] love this gun, right after the Desert Eagle, because the "XD" looks like an [[emoticon]]. This gun is designed to function even with the muzzle pressed against a flat surface, such as someone's back.

====.357 Magnum - BOOM! [[Headshot]]====
[[Image:IHero.jpg|thumb|iHero]]
Once you have returned home from killing the entire [[Vietnam|Viet Kong]] army, you have become the Pennsylvania state treasurer. You receive bribes and give your friends exclusive million dollar contracts as well as receiving $300,000 kickbacks. When you fuck it up and get convicted; facing 55 years imprisonment, you end it all by [[Budd Dwyer|blowing your brains out with this baby in front of a live televised press conference.]]
If you want to dramatically kill some one, make sure to shoot him in the lungs closer to the arm to let him live at least a few seconds more (according to Wikipedia you feel like "struck by lightning" when shot at), then let him crawl a little, then shoot him in the heart.

====10mm Auto====
[[Image:Asacoonkilla.jpg|thumb|[[PROTIP]]: if your movie sucks, then just [[Quentin Tarantino|add a bunch of guns]] so fanboi's will like you.]]
Ownage in the [[masturbation|palm of your hand]]. Packing the power of a .357 into a frame the size of a .45 with the ammo capacity of a 9mm, the 10mm Auto was released to much fanfare of it's awesomeness. Well, no it wasn't.  Actually, [[nobody cares|nobody cared]].

The [[Party Van|FBI]] adopted it briefly before crying that the recoil hurt their wrists, which were sore after they got done 'researching' all those [[Chris Hanson|CP websites]]. Smith & Wesson obliged by creating the .40S&W, which is believed to stand for either "Smith & Wesson", "Shitty & Weak" or the widely accepted "Shoop & Woop".

====FN Five-seveN====
Admired by [[Libertarian]]s and [[spics]] for its ability to pierce body armor and kill cops. The FN Five-seveN (LOL SO CLEVER THEY MADE THE F AND THE N IN [[caps lock|CAPS]]) is used in a lot of animes and video gaymes, so of course all school shooters pick this up for the job, because, as we know, most school shooters are actually [[13 year old boys]] who have been [[fapping]] to too much violent [[hentai]].  However, anyone who is on the path to [[an hero|enlightenment]] will need to save up his allowance for a long time or use mommy and daddy's credit card, as the Five-seveN and its silly 5.7x28mm proprietary cartridge are quite expensive.

====Hi-Point C9====
A 9mm pistol that runs about $120 brand new. [[Unrealistic expectations|It does the exact same thing as $700 pistols]]. Post a picture of one in any weapons related area on the internet and watch the sparks fly.  A favorite of black person and [[Mexico|Mexicans]].  They have a [[lifetime]] warranty (Which is in practice a Week At most before the Owner gets killed by a Nigger), but [[headshot|it's hard to make a claim with the slide sticking out of your fucking forehead.]]

====Walther P22====
Originally designed as a target pistol in weak .22LR, the P22 found a new home in the hands of [[Cho|The Blazn Azn]].  He dual-wielded it with a Glock in order to achieve the highest score in [[American]] history!  Walther was of course very pleased by this, and instantly issued a statement commemorating the occasion.

====Sig Mosquito====
Another target pistol chambered for .22LR that found a new notoriety in the hands of [[The Finnisher]].  It should be noted that while Cho used both a 9mm Glock and a .22 pistol, PEA only used a single .22 pistol.  This is a good explanation for why he achieved such a low score.  Sig Sauer refused to issue a statement, since they were afraid crazy [[Finland|Finns]] would riot outside of their stores after the ensuing sales boom caused stocks of the Mosquito to run dry.  

====The Desert Eagle (Deagle)====
[[Image:1265906570823.jpg|thumb|[[Niggers]] love the deagle brand deagle.]]
If the .357 Magnum is for men with normal dicks and the .44 Magnum is for men with small dicks, the Desert Eagle is for men with dicks so small they are actually [[Chyna|mistaken for clits]] by the casual eye. The Desert Eagle is classified as a handgun, despite being bigger than most SMGs. You can create lulz by going to a DE forum and saying the .357 and .44 are fired from more practical-sized guns like revolvers, <s>but fanboys will say the Desert Eagle will fire .50AE and revolvers [[common sense|won't]]</s> DISREGARD THAT, MAGNUM RESEARCH MAKES A REVOLVER FOR .50 AE. The Desert Eagle got notoriety in the U.S. when niggers got their hands on it. Unfortunately, they thought they were holding their Glocks sideways and when they pulled the trigger, they killed themselves from the impact on their head. If you fire the Deagle with only one hand, you'll break your wrist, and then, just like with the Uzi, you'll never [[fap]] again.  A fun fact about the Deagle is that while it is in just about every video game ever, no real military or police force has ever adopted it.  Ever.  <strike>Sorry fanboys!</strike> Not really. Glock 18 is the most under-rated gun [[Imma Let You Finish|OF ALL TIME!]]

====Smith & Wesson Model 500====
Somehow, for the aforementioned men who felt they needed compensate for their impossibly small penises, buying a Deagle just wasn't effective enough. (If that can be believed.) So Smith & Wesson [[came]] down as a saving grace, offering a wheelgun of such extraordinary, such legendarily [[XBOX HUEG]] proportions, that the cartridges which it fires are literally larger than the collective dick of all the men who purchased the damned thing. While it may be able to take down a grizzly [[pedobear|bear]] (in a laughably improbably situation which would give a concealed-carry nut a wet dream), the necesary twelve inch [[longcat|long]] compensated (snicker) barrel means that it takes so long to draw that you'll already have been mauled by the bear ten times over before you can get a single shot out. It is required by law that you sleep with this gun under your pillow and give it a feminine name, lest [[you]] get the passing urge to perhaps go out and try finding a real girl.

====HK MP5 - spray 'n pray====
[[Image:Cream Has Three Guns by bendilin.jpg|thumb|right|The <strike>MP5</strike> <strike>UMP</strike> <strike>MP5K-PDW</strike>. The ultimate SMG, and favorite of furry sex symbols]]
So you decided to use one of these guns on this page to create a [[lulz|lulz]] fest at your local school, mall, and/or place of employment, and now you're wondering what's the fuzz is going to be thrown at you when you get to the [[Vtech|final level of the game]]. Five out of five times, when you've got yourself a good score going and you live in an urban area, the swat bunnies will be plugging your socially mis-adjusted body with the HK MP5. Don't despair, the HK MP5 is the perfect firearm to get mowed down by on national TV.  It was also the first closed bolt submachine gun with fine [[Hitler|Nazi]] precision pedigree, so you can be assured that you are going out in style. The 9mm ammunition means that you won't die too quickly so you can have that dramatic last stand, just like in ''Scarface''! Bonus points if you get killed by a [[Mexican|beaner]] wearing shades, from behind, with a shotgun while you're firing your weapon of choice dramatically in the air, as the cops riddle your body with US government lead.

====The Tommy Gun====
For those who like to kick it really old school nothin' beats the classic Thompson submachine gun. The gun comes with either a 30 round box magazine , a 50 round drum or even a 100 round one which looks way more bad ass. Very popular with gangsters. Extremely inaccurate but it makes up for it by how much lead it sprays allover the place.  Uses the .45 ACP cartridge, developed by His Holiness John Moses Browning Himself!  Even Stevie Wonder could waste mofos with this.

==== Uzi (Moar like JEWzi, [[no|amirite?]])====
[[Image:Nazi with uzi.jpeg|thumb|left|Even [[Nazi]]s love Israeli weapons manufacturers!]]
The Uzi (Jewspeak: עוזי‎) was invented solely to rape sand nigger babies. It's based on the Czechoslovakian series 23 to 26 submachine guns, and is further proof that Jews steal everything, [[amirite?]].  Every American should have two.  You have two hands, after all, right? [[lolwut|Ironically]], it's the preferred weapon of neo-[[Nazis]], skinheads and Tommy Vershitty (too bad Carl Johnson couldn't buy some in his [[USA|country]]. Shooting this thing one-handed, though it may look cool, will either break your wrist (no more [[fapping]]) or turn you into [[an hero]] unless you're Bruce Willis...or Carl Johnson, who can hold two fuckin' Sawn-offs and can still walk away and [[fap]] afterwords. Lucky Bastard. Uzis, thus, look cool, but aren't as cool as a frickin' AK-47. Chambered in 9mm but having less power than MP5's, that explains why the fuck their magazines are loaded with 32 rounds and not 30. Jews just can't count right.

==== MP40 ====
Known as the Macheinen Pistole .40 to NeoNazis, this gun is favored by them because they just happened to be used by the original Nazis (though they automatically failed hard against Russian weaponry).  This is as close as you can get to being Michael J. Fox with a pistol because it is semi-automatic.

==== PPSH-41 ====
[[Image:Ppshchair.jpg|thumb|The PPSh-41 even makes a great chair when you [[lazy|need to sit]]!]]
The [[Russian]]-made PPSh-41 (Also known as a bullethose for it's ridiculously high [[awesome|rate of fire]] (900 rounds per minute)). Firing the small, but powerful 7.62x25mm Tokarev round, this thing has killed more [[nazis]] and [[americans]] than [[epic|the showers at Auschwitz have killed Jews]]. Because the USSR loved to share with anyone who [[communists|agrees with them]], many [[gooks]] and Arab have gotten their filthy hands on these fine weapons and used them on [[America|foreign invaders]]. Even today, the PPSh-41 is used by [[terrorists]] in the middle east to fight decadent westerners. During WW2, entire platoons would be equipped with this [[rapist|firearm]], giving them [[rape|unparalleled close combat effectiveness]]. 

====Tec-9====
The Tec-9 an unbelievably shite one-handed SMG made famous by [[GTA|Carl Johnson]] and the [[Columbine]] gays. It was made by Intratec 'til they went bust and so now only exists as cheap [[gook]] copies or as museum pieces. Somehow shooting it one-handed doesn't break your wrist, so this is the gun of choice for [[fap]]stars. It fires standard 9mm pistol rounds just like every other fucking gun out there. School shootings with this thang will make the media shit bricks and come out with [[shit]] like "[[Columbine]] REVISITED!" and "School Shootings - A PHENOMENON?!". That means it's perfect for the job; after all, what could be more satisfying to the average [[an hero]] than the thought of causing a media stir becasue of the gun they used, and maybe getting [[hippies|Michael Moore]] to ban the sale of its ammo?

====P90/PS90====
The P90 is a compact submachine gun meant for easy concealment from [[the man|police]] while you [[gay|tote]] it around your local mall while still [[unrealistic expectations|retaining the ability to hit like an assault rifle]] and penetrate body armor. It does this by firing the same light and fast 5.7x28mm round as its relative, the FiveseveN (also made by FN). The P90 is notable due to its standard large capacity magazine which doesn't protrude from the weapon at all yet provides 50 rounds of cop killing ecstasy. Its extremely light recoil, even in full auto, means even [[pussies]] can shoot it. It's [[retarded|odd]] [[fugly|futuristic]] shape causes a lot of interest in the weapon from [[13 year old boys]]. Sadly the P90 isn't available to every day homicidal maniacs, so we must make due with the civilian PS90. The PS90 is a semi-auto [[longcat|long barrel]] version of the P90 that usually comes in green and is sold with 30 round magazines. The PS90 can be converted to a P90 by simply hack sawing off the barrel, threading , and capping with a flash suppressor. Modding the seer for auto fire. Buy real 50 round P90 magazines. And spray painting it black. But this will get you [[V&]] unless you are licensed to own an automatic "SBR" (short barrel rifle) and modify weapons for full auto use, which you aren't, so don't even try.

====MP7====
The MP7 was created for the same reason as the P90, but more compact and even more ugly. It fires the 4.6x30mm round which is slightly more effective at penetrating body armor. It uses a more traditional protruding magazine in either 20 or 30 round configurations. Good luck getting your hands on one, and even if you do, good luck finding any ammo.  Also, since it usually uses a 20-round mag and it fires at a very high rate, you'll drain the clip in under two seconds if you set it in auto mode.  Way to go, [[loser]].


</div></div>
<div class="content4"><div style="border:1px solid #CCCCCC; padding:8px">The uber cool guns for [[pwning]] on the biggest scale.




==== LMGs (Light machine guns)====
These are autos you can carry around, like the M240, M249 SAW, MG3, M60, BAR, RPD, RPK, MG34, M1919 and Bren. They can clear a room of students faster than yelling "[[Maury|YOU ARE THE FATHER!]]" at an black person meeting - plus they look teh awesome. They usually fire rifle-sized bullets. Modern ones, sadly, only fire shitty 5.56mm rounds, which [[fail]].

====Heavy Stuff====
Think Maxim, Vickers, M2, MG42 and DshK. These will gleefully slice 'n' dice your foes to [[over 9000]] pieces, with big bullets. These are teh awesome, more so than LMGs, just because they pwn so well. Only [[Over 9000]] rounds from a .50-cal can even scratch a [[long cat]]. However, against ordinary fools, you will [[win]]. Niggers can't get their chicken grease mitts on these 'coz they're even more expensive than [[put shoe on head|Nike kicks]]!. If they do, prepare for <strike>equality</strike> <strike>TEH END OF DE WORLD.</strike> Don't be silly, Niggers aren't smart enough to use guns. That's why [[Black Jesus|Obama]] wants to ban guns, because he's jealous of [[The Man|the white man's]] superiority.

Don't even bother tooling one of these up for a school shooting, though; it weighs too damn much. Just leave it on a Hummer (for drive-bys) or on a tripod (for long ranged spraying) and let rip. Hurrah!

====Gatling Guns====
[[Image:Korean War.gif|thumb|[[A Cat Is Fine Too|A gat is fine too]]]]
So you want a school shooting with a difference? A 6-barrel XM214 Gatling gun can fire [[over 9000|10,000]] rounds a minute, at 3750 fps. Bye bye school, [[alpha male|jocks]], [[basement dweller|nerds]], [[12 year old girls|whores]], and [[emos]]. 

The Gatling gun comes in a variety of different flavors, not unlike [[slurpee]]s, or condoms. Starting with the biggest, baddest motherfucker of all, the GAU-8 Avenger, a 30mm precision engineered lead-breathing dragon that has an A-10 Warthog mounted to it. This monster fires [[OMG|Depleted Uranium rounds the size of wine bottles]] meant for decimating rusted [[russian|ruskie]] armor and [[arab|sand nigger]] caves. It puts out over 4 tons of recoil force and the gun itself weighs 620lbs, but once you add n the magazine and the hydraulics system required to fire it, you're looking at over 4000lbs, then you'll need almost 2000lbs of ammo for about 15 seconds of [[fap|blissful carnage]]. For best results, mount it on your bicycle.

A somewhat smaller version is the 6-barrel M61 Vulcan, capable of firing 20mm [[dildos|rounds]] at [[over 9000|over 6000]] rounds per minute that will blast Ruskie jets out of the sky when all the missiles are used up. Also used for [[blowjob|blowing]] [[penis|missiles]] out of the sky when mounted to ships and [[web 2.0|controlled by robots]] as the CIWS weapon system. The M196 is a 3-barrel version mounted on AH-1 Cobra's used for [[anal|buttplugging]] [[terrorists]] at close range.

[[shit nobody cares about|A 'smaller' Gatling gun gaining popularity as a mobile vehicle mounted system]] is the 3 barrel, .50 caliber GAU-19 GECAL ('jekyll'). It hits as hard as an M2 .50 cal heavy machine gun but has a rate of fire 4 times faster. This allows you to [[vtech|rack up points]] nearly as fast as a panty-waste M134 but with the added benefit of doing it even when their hiding behind three concrete walls and the [[Nuke#World_War_II|nuke proof desks]] at your local school house.

Smaller still, is the General Electric M134, known commonly as the "Minigun." This 7.62mm beast was first used in the skies over [[Vietnam]] to spread [[aids|freedom and democracy]] to the [[azn|gooks]], either as a door gun on the <s>UH-60 Blackhawk</s> UH-1 Huey (no blackhawks in Vietnam dumbass), or as a [[goatse|offensive weapon]] on the [[homosexual|versatile]] <s>MH-6</S>, AH-6 "[[shota|Little]] [[cock|Bird]]". Made most famous in Terminator 2 when the [[arnold|governator]] laid the smack down on some [[leftard|Californian]] [[the man|police]] when they tried to take away his [[god]] given right to carry around large caliber assault weaponery. The [[pwn|ownage]] was so great, they appointed him their supreme ruler. <s>The M134 also comes in 5.56mm, if you're too pussy to handle the recoil.</s> No it doesn't.

The smallest yet conceived was the 6-barrel XM214 5.56 Gatling gun. It fired literally [[over 9000]] rounds per minute. But it offered no practicality over the M134 and little/no advantage in weight. Even this model put out more than 200lbs of recoil force, weighed over 30lbs, and required at least 100lbs in backup equipment, such as batteries and large cases of ammo, which is needless to say, more than your limp wristed faggoty ass can handle. So forget your dreams of recreating the scene in Predator unless you want to [[an hero]] yourself in possibly the most ridiculous fashion possible. On second thought [[DO IT FAGGOT]].

But if you want to kick it old school, look no further than the original Gatling gun, [[shit nobody cares about|invented by Dr. Richard Jordan Gatling]] [[at least 100 years ago]], when Amerrcuh was [[scissoring|waging war]] within its own borders.  This [[old]] [[milf|warhorse]] didn't have your fancy [[vibrator|electric drive motors]]. No, you put elbow grease into this antique, as you had to [[fap|hand-crank]] the thing to [[cum|shoot it]]. If you can find enough of the obsolete .58 caliber rimfire cartridges to fill the hopper of this [[old]]-timer, you can waste your school just like your great-great-great-granddaddy did to the black person who refused to work the fields.

</div></div>
<div class="content5"><div style="border:1px solid #CCCCCC; padding:8px">A list of more guns on a scale of [[pwning]] it makes the other guns look [[shit]]

====Big Game Rifles====
Not classed as ordinary rifles, coz they're so fucking huge. Best used to put holes in elephant's skulls, but if you want to terrorize the local [[niggers]] just load a .60 or .577 up at point it at 'em. Just don't fire it lying down (broken collar bone) or standing up (broken shoulder). Breaking your bones while pwning [[niggers]] will [[fail]] you, minussing your score by [[over 9000]] points. Alternately, use them against other snipers, who will be using .50 BMG, 7.62mm, or, if they're real [[fap|wankers]], 5.56mm.

====Shotgun====
Use this bad boy to really fuck up someone's day. Sprays a lot of buckshot everywhere which means you can pwn a whole bunch of people or destroy one person at extremely close range. Very popular with hunters and cops and comes in many flavors like the pussy fuck .410 , the 12 gauge and the PWNAGE 4 Gauge Magnum that will fucking pwn the fuck out of any sandnigger you meet.  Alternately: 1. Saw stock off 2. Shorten the barrel(s) to about 4 inches. 3. Fire it one handed. 4. ???? 5. PROFIT!!

Fat cops fear the shotgun especially, since a 12 gauge slug reliably penetrates the Level IIIa body armor that they wear.  They never expect getting owned in the face. Shotguns are also more effective if you're [[Gears of War|host]] or [[Bruce Campbell]] and are fighting [[Doom|demons]] in the past for some fucked up demon book.

[[Image:Kill it with fire scorpio.gif|thumb|left|[[Kill it with fire|Kill your enemies with fire]]]]
====[[KILL IT WITH FIRE|Flamethrower]]====
[[Image:Stupiddemotivator.jpg|thumb|The memorial for Jamal and his friends is now [http://www.LolTrain.com on MySpace] ]]
The closest you can actually come to playing Satan. Strap on 2 scuba tanks full of napalm and rain fiery death on [[gooks]]. Just be careful not to use it on a really windy day or you'll involuntarily become [[an hero]].  Much to the ire of [[leftards]], you can legally own or build one. [http://www.cracked.com/article_17016_7-items-you-wont-believe-are-actually-legal.html Srsly.] The best part of this weapon is that you can take out a whole platoon in one shot, however if someone shoots the tank, prepare to suffer one of the most worst and painful deaths imaginable.

====Grenade Launcher====
This is a gun that shoots 25mm or 40mm grenades. Boom! The M-79 is a favorite from 'Nam, perfect for ruining [[Gooks]]. Like a smaller Bazooka, basically. Watch out, though, it's illegal in California. Oh wait, so is everything else. Except [[weed]]. The M203  and M320 improve on the M79 by replacing the stock with [[Win|a functional assault rifle]]. Now you can have the best of both worlds for just a few pounds more!
The Heckler & Koch GMG combines the raw power of [[Rape|a 40mm grenade launcher]] with the fully-automatic convenience of a belt-fed machine gun. While it has a greater maximum range and [[Over 9000|rate of fire]] than the M79, its recoil and weight make it [[Fail|less than ideal]] for on-the-go use unless mounted to a vehicle.

====[[C-note|Bazooka]]====
Will ruin everything from [[goth]]s to [[teenager]]s to the entire local [[mall]] in a glorious explosion of [[win]].  A favorite of [[Counter-Strike]] O.G.s.  They don't like dat shit one-two bit. Only refers to the bazooka itself, the rest are called recoiless rifles, asshole.

====[[Quake|Railgun]]====
This does happen to exist IRL as it is being experimented with by the Navy as the new anti-warshit gun.  It uses two electrostatic field creating rails and shoves a huge-ass block of metal at [[over 9000]] times the speed of sound with a range limit of over 9000 miles away.  Naturally this can be the next ultimate in pwning power, but the fields are so strong that when the bullet goes through, it breaks itself apart and requires a month of charging the electricity needed.

====[[Doom 3|Duct Tape]]====
With duct tape, you can strap two guns together, like a shotgun and a machine gun.  However, with duct tape you can also make A FUCKING MINIGUN WITH A FLAMETHROWER AND FIVE MACHINE GUNS AND SHOTGUNS on it (though you will have to operate each weapon manually, something your [[gay|effete]] wrists are probably not meant to handle).  Duct Tape is something not to be fucked with but if you happened to have purchased a cheaper mesh, don't expect anyone to be afraid of your death contraption when it's in pieces all over the ground.

====The [[Goldeneye|Golden Gun]]====
Kills with one bullet. This is partly due to the little known toxicity of gold.  When using the golden gun [[IRL]], be sure to memorize all the respawn points, and use it on your enemies before they can fight back. Also be sure to be rich, as, being made of gold, the Golden Gun is, unsurprisingly, fucking expensive. Once you have it, though, you will be able to kill every black person from here to [[Africa|Swaziland]].

====[[Video Games|Minigun]]====
In every [[video game]] ever. [[EVAR]]. While this exists in a mounted variant [[IRL]], you cannot carry one around with you. [[America]] decided it would be a [[Pretty Cool Guy|pretty good idea]] to make one that you could carry around, but it was determined that carrying around a 70 pound [[Internet Hate Machine|death machine]] with no way of aiming the damn thing would almost certianly lead to [[An Hero|an heroism]] and [[Counter Strike|team kills]], resulting in epic [[rage]] and a few [[lulz]]. Was never used in any war ever.</div></div>

==The [[NRA]]==
[[Image:Gunnuts.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Typical NRA member.]]
Formed in 1871 along with the [[KKK]], the '''NRA''' was established to give [[Republican|White racists]], gun-loving soccer moms and hungover rednecks the ability to focus their [[God]]-given talents on something much more important: shooting homosexuals, Muslims, Blacks and Scientists. The most noted savior of the NRA was Charlton Heston, who proved that the best reason for us to have guns is to defend ourselves from <s>damn dirty apes</s> <s>terrorists</s> [[Libertarians|OUR GUBMENT!!!11]].  This group holds that guns are good, and totally ignores studies done by [[Michael Moore|bleeding-heart pseudosciences]] like "psychology," "sociology," and "political science". The NRA is always doing its duty saving us from the tyrannical grip of people who support gun control - like that godawful boring [[Noam Chomsky]]. Oddly enough, many [[liberals]] have begun to [http://www.liberalswithguns.com join the ranks of the NRA], for fear that gun control may render them defenseless against their crazy-ass [[redneck]] neighbors.

==Gun vs. Sword==
[[Image:Indianaowns.gif|right|thumb|Gun > sword]]
[[Image:Swordvsgun.gif|thumb|This completely original animu agrees.]]
Guns have replaced the archaic simpleton sword as the killing device of choice for a good many reasons, not least of which is the gun's [[awesome|superiority over hand-to-hand weapons]].  Some fanboys are in a state of denial about this. 

*''Myth'': Swords are more honorable. Case in point: [[Ninja|ninja]]s and samurai, [[Jedi]] and other knights used swords.
**'''FACT''': Anyone claiming the above is obviously a cultureless, fucking [[Wapanese]] and needs to commit [[Hara kiri]], die of [[AIDS]] or become [[an hero]]. Ninjas were fags anyway, and the samurai EXTENSIVELY used guns. Jedi are fucking imaginary anyway.
*''Myth'': You can block bullets with a sword if you are skilled enough.
**'''FACT''': You can block bullets with your sword but the bullet will shatter and then spread out into little pieces hitting eveything behind the sword, like say, the person using the sword. Or, if the gun is a shotgun, break the sword in half an send the large sharp upper half into the user's body.
*''Myth'': You don't have to reload a sword, therefore you can use it forever.
**'''FACT''': You must constantly wipe your sword clean of blood and sharpen it, otherwise it will chip and [[old|rust away]], and then you will have to beg [[your mom]] for money so you can buy another shitty [[weaboo]] sword off of the internet.
*''Myth'': Guns are cowardly because you can kill people from a distance; swords take real skill to use.
**'''FACT''': Hacking and slicing away takes too much effort, when you can just sit back, relax and start obliterating [[Wapanese]] hordes with your M249 SAW. More importantly, using a gun IRL takes more skill than any [[Wapanese]] could ever possess. Even more importantly, using a gun guarantees lulz, even with a shitty [[Europe|Czech]] pistol from the 70's.
*''Myth'': You can run up to a guy with a gun real fast and slice him with your sword before he even gets his gun out.
**'''FACT''': You can try to run up to a guy with a sword real fast and slice him before he even gets his gun out, but unfortunately that sword you bought from [[eBay]] weighs a few pounds and your [[gay|effete]] wrists just can't handle such a burden. If the fucker has a gun, he'll have it out and pwn you in [[at least 100]] ways, [[retard]].
