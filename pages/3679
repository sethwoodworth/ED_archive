'''''Myth:''''' This is a beautifully drawn [[anime]] with a well-developed intriguing plot and character growth and no [[furries]] whatsoever. [[Religion]] is realistically portrayed and this series is not at all [[goth]] or [[emo]]. Guns are all normal-sized.

'''''Fact:'''''
Religion amounts to a bunch of random namedropping and a [[pedophile|Catholic priest]] who can throw hundreds of knives at people in milliseconds. Guns are bigger than most army trucks. The villains are [[Awwright|baby-eating]] [[Nazi]] [[Goth|vampires]] which, [[some argue]], is a very entertaining thing. It's still [[Over 9000|about 100]] times better than [[Twilight]] though.

A creation of someone's sickening imagination, probably driven by a mix of depression, [[Quentin Tarantino|gayness]], and [[LSD]] mixed with rubbing [[alcohol]]. A script was not involved in the creation process.
Interesting details: One of the few anime series that actually looks painful (knife licking, knife through neck, fork in eyes, etc.) The good guy is made of blood, is immortal, the biggest fucking [[Mary Sue]] since [[My Immortal|Enoby Dark'ness]], and can turn into a [[Fatty|big, black, eye-covered blob]]. The "master" figure is confirmed as a female in episode 10.

As of sometime [[last Thursday]] they were making a remake of the OAV that is supposed to [[pwn]] the original 13 episode series. The new OAV follows the [[manga]] more closely than it's [[Defriend|disowned]] counterpart.  Really, though, it's just the same thing with more knives and [[over 9000]] people getting stabbed.

It's being done by [[13-year-old boy|Korean sweat shop children]] under the supervision of [[Nazi|Disney]] and is complete and utter crap. Coloring is being done by a trained pack of [[furry|Scottish Terriers]] who throw bucket-loads of color at once at the papers, [[fucktard |making all the colors mismatch]] or [[americunt|otherwise make absolutely no sense]]. 

[[I_did_it_for_the_lulz|They did it for the lulz.]] 

Also [[whore|Seras]] gets [[buttsex|raped]] by [[zombie|zombies]]. Twice.

==[[tl;dr|TL;DR? Episode Synopsis!]]==
Your average episode follows the following formula.
I fucking dare you to challenge this flawless logic: 
# There's a brutal murder.
# OSHIII VAMPIRES!!111[[1]]
# Call Hellsing/Alucard.
# Vampire challenges Alucard to exhibit its [[e-peen|strength]]. 
# Alucard initiates the [[hax]]
# Alucard gets shot, cut, burnt, raped, etc to no visible effect.
# Vampire shits itself and Alucard literally [[fellatio|eats said zombie]].
# [[????]]
# [[PROFIT]]!

==Main Characters==
* '''Alucard:''' The main character and protagonist. Alucard is lame [[Goth | Vampire]] with a great big perpetual [[German|shit-eating]] grin on his face. Despite this, however, he possesses the power of God and cannot die. Unfortunately by some cruel twist of fate he is to be a servant to Lady Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing for the rest of his days. <s>Since his name is "DRACULA" backwards (OMG SUBTLETY!) there is perpetual fan [[shit nobody cares about|debate]] over whether or not he is Dracula himself, Dracula's son or in fact, a mere Jew.</s> Was revealed in 8th volume that he is Dracula. SPOILER ALERT! ALUCARD DIES BY ABSORBING SCHRODINGER

* '''Seras Victoria:''' also known as [[Engrish| <b>Ceres</b>, <b>Celes</b>]], or <b>Police Girl</b> (because people are too fucking stupid to ever agree on names) is a [[16-year-old girl|16-year-old]] slut cop who gets [[rape|turned]] into a vampire. She becomes Alucard's [[Pedophilia|servant]] after she gets a hardcore [[anal]] [[rape]] from him in volume one. Seras carries around a huge fucking gun called "Harkonnon" which possesses the spirit of [[Jon Stewart]], whom talks to her while she sleeps. The only thing bigger than her gun, is her [[tits]], which are size of Seattle on a stormy day during the second coming of Christ, making her the only fuckable character in the entire series. Surprisingly, [[lolwut|she claims to be a virgin.]] 

* '''[[tl;dr|Sir Integral Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing]]:'''  [[shemale|A woman who dresses like a man]]. It should be noted that it takes the average reader AT LEAST 2 volumes before they discover she is a woman. She is a dyke who controls Alucard, and like a typical woman, bitches (literally) about everything  and gives orders. Is she [[mpreg|carrying ALucard's baby]]? She eventually dies of lung cancer because she smokes way too much for her own good. It's later revealed that she's a virgin so it's no wonder why she's such a bitch. 

* '''Walter [[Cum|C.]] Dornez:''' An Jew who fought [[Hitler]] with fishing line. He is Integra's personal servant. He gets the shit [[pwn|pwned]] out of him by Alucard [[over_9000|over 9,000]] times [[for_great_justice|for great justice]].

* '''Father Anderson:''' Alucard's rival (which is fucking pointless, since Alucard can't be killed). He is a Catholic [[pedophile]] priest who works for the Vatican, and speaks with a fucking retarded Scottish accent. He fights with knives and pieces of paper, and is the only human character who can't be killed. Fortunately this is proven wrong in Volume 8 when he is brutally fucked by Alucard and turns into a tree.

* '''Captain Pip Bernadotte:''' The leader of some group of the mercenary group called "Cock of Cheese". He is a porn star who [[Masturbation|faps]] to Seras on a regular basis. It should also be noted that his accent and ethnicity changes every third day of the week.

* '''Major [[Anonymous |Whatshisname:]]''' The reincarnation of [[Hitler]] with [[fat|hideous eating disorder]], also known as [[unfunny|Drew Carey]]'s twin, who inevitably ignites World War 3 [[I did it for the lulz|just for the lulz of it]]. He's also a cyborg. [[WTF|Seriously]].

* '''[[Fag|Luke]] and [[Jan]] Valentine:''' [[an hero|An heroes]] who decided to go on a killing spree at Hellsing HQ. Unfortunately they only last for 1 volume because the interesting characters always die first. They are easily distinguishable by the fact that Luke looks like he can power through a 10-hour buttsecks marathon and Jan is actually a pretty cool guy. Eh fuckin' skullfucks the fuck out of fuckin everything and doesn't fuckin afraid of Alucard's fuckin dyke of a fuckin boss. Fuck.

* '''Rip Van Winkle:''' Despite the name, she's female. Her speech consists of quoting old Operas that nobody gives a shit about. She is nearsighted, and has the same dykish fashion sense as Integra. Despite being [[over 9000]] years old she still looks like a 16 year old japanese schoolgirl. Because she considers herself to be [[fail|serious business]], she attempts to act like an opera star by caring around a [[dildo|musket]] as a weapon (which is instant fail since muskets are complete shit). Luckily, Alucard arrives to beat the shit out of her. Though to his dismay, the musket <i>actually</i> works. Fortunately it isn't enough to stop him and he ends up impaling her with his cock. In the OVA, her voice actor cums buckets as she dies. SUBTLE.

* '''Zorin Blitz:''' Yet another dike character. She takes steroids and carries a huge fucking scythe. She kills Pip, rapes Seras' mother and forces Seras to watch. Soon after, her head is literally ripped open by Seras who is mad for some strange reason.

* '''The Captain:''' A skyscraper cleverly disguised as a Nazi that no one even knows exists. Earned his prestegious position of standing around strung out on meth all day by killing [[over 9000]] Jews. Aliases include 'Ze Kapitain' by Major, 'That guy I want inside me' by Seras and Schrödinger, and 'OH MEIN GOTT ITS TOO BIG' by Rip. Weaboos have officially decided that his name is 'Hans Günsche' because nobody in this series can have just one fucking name. Despite the fact that legions of greasy-ass cockhungry fangirls have supplied the internets with [[at least 100]] sketches and fanfiction (moar like fanFAIL, AMIRITE?) of him railing Schrodinger like a bullet train, he is arguably the only straight character in the whole series since he never did, or will, say anything that can be made fun of. Oh yeah, he's also werewolf. 

* '''[[Trap|Schrödinger]]:''' Another character whose gender isn't cleary defined. Although argued by many, he's actually male. Schrödinger is a [[Kemonomimi|catboy]], invented by the Nazis. Apparently. He is the only character who cannot be killed by Alucard due to the fact that he can be [[Time paradox|"Everyvhere und Novhere"]] at the same time. 
[[Image:Longschro.jpg|thumb|left|[[Longcat|Longschro]] is LOOOOOOONG]]

* '''[[Mexican|Tubalcain Alhambra]]:''' The wetback version of Gambit from X-Men. He attacks with exploding playing cards. Because of his immense [[faggotry]], he is killed after only 1 volume. 

* '''[[Anonymous|Incognito]]:''' An aborted fetus with [[AIDS]]. Gets fucked [[in the ass]] with a long pole. He is the least important character since he only appears only in the shitty TV [[anime]].

==Rating==
*''Action'': 23	Stabbin' n' shootin' n' 'splodin', usually to a single person and all at the same time.
*''Lulz'': 3 Almost five minutes worth, mostly people getting violently murdered for no reason, which under few circumstances can be extremely funny. There's also baby eating, which is always a knee slapper.
*''Furry Gayness'': 1 there is a were-dog thing near the end. (5 if you count the [[Catgirl|catgirls]] in the manga and Schrodinger).


==How to Troll Hellsing fans==

For those of you who are big Hellsing fans, you know it's not hard to troll those who take it too seriously. Also, like most fandoms it is [[Serious business|SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS]] like no joke if you get ANY detail wrong you must not be a fan. If you have ever talked to a serious fan it's quite easy to troll. The BIGGEST thing you can do to piss them off is to say any of the 'canon' pairings are [[wrong]]/don't make sense/are [[retarded]] then proceed to make up pairing you can explain better, cause they'll deny any say on [[your]] opinions, cause [[your]] opinions don't matter.

'''Steps to begin trolling:'''

1. Tell them Integra and Alucard - isn't the most [[HAWT]] thing EVAR. Tell them they don't even belong together. You'll create the biggest shitstorm ever by saying this pairings is dumb.

2. Tell them Integra X Seras or tell them Seras is better with Alucard.

3. Write Hellsing [[fanfiction]] with [[original]] characters

4. [[Cosplay]] Hellsing (God they hate that)

5.??????

6. PROFIT!


==How to Troll Hellsing Roleplayers/ writers==

1. Pair your character with Alucard

2. Make your character more [[original]] than Alucard - This means making them a [[more]] bad ass character, therefore, trumping Alucard. But you can't trump Alucard...no you can't you [[noob|n00b!]] Alucard however (contrary to the fans) is a [[Sue]], so make your character NOT a [[Sue]]

3. Making your character better, stronger, older than Alucard...biggest shitstorm right here. Remember! You can't make ANYONE better than Alucard!

4. Write anything other than an Integra/Alucard fic

5. ????

6. PROFIT!
