PNG
Created by [[open source|cheapwads]] as a patent-less and improved version of [[GIF]], '''PNG''' stands for '''P'''ay '''N'''o '''G'''old to the [[Jews]]. PNG images are <s>almost</s> completely superior to GIFs.<s>, except for the fact they do not support animations, therefore making them, for all intents and purposes of ruining browsers, useless</s>.

PNG slowly became common, based on the fact, that the [[Fucktard|programmers of Microsoft]] were too lazy to support PNG images until [[fail|version 7 of Windows]].

[[ALL CAPS|PNG GRAPHICS ALSO SUPPORT ANIMATIONS]], [[Nobody Cares|called APNG graphics. They use the normal .png extension]] and are also not supported by [[Spyware|Microsoft's crappy software]].

There used to be a 1,000,000x1,000,000 image here, but [[MediaWiki]] had to go and hate on our fun :(
