The '''Subservient Chicken''' was one of the first major [[viral]] Internet [[marketing]] campaigns and [[NPOV|was also the greatest]]. Created by [[Burger King]] in [[2004]] to advertise the Tendercrisp Chicken [[Sammich]]. The site consists of a guy in a [[cock|chicken]] costume standing in a room containing of a couch, a loveseat, a television and a lamp. The chicken will do anything you ask him to just so he doesn't get eaten. A text box that you could type commands into was at the bottom of the window. While the chicken will fail to [[put shoe on head]] every time, he is fairly accurate at black person. This led [[eternal September|leagues of idiots]] to believe that the feed was live and that he was sitting in a room on webcam taking orders exclusively for them.

=== Parody ===

A parody site, SubservientPresident.com, contained a man dressed up like [[Jewnited States of Americunts|US]] history's greatest president, [[George W Bush]], basically doing the same thing. The [[satire|satirical]] nature of this [[parody]] was to show that GWB is such a man of the people that he will do anything for regular folks like [[you]].

The Subservient Chicken has [[Less than 9000|over 300]] commands that you can have him do but typing keywords into the command line below the active window. These commands range from boring to lulzy. He will not do anything sexual, which is lame. This is thought to be because it is embarrassed by his small [[dick|cloaca]]. Below is a list of some of the more entertaining ones:

*'''Smoke''' Subservient Chicken will smoke a [[cancer|cigarette]]. Asking it to smoke [[weed]] of any sort and you will get a [[lamer|disappointed gesture]] 
*'''Downward dog''' For all you yogafags. Chicken will go from the "[[Doggystyle|Downward facing dog]]", to the "Sun salutation"
*'''Frustrate''' Chicken will smash his head against the wall
*'''Piss''' [[watersports|Pretty self explanitory]]
*'''Seduce''' Our protagonist will do a sexy chicken dance
*'''Dance''' Some hipster whore comes out and dances with him
*'''Make out''' Chicken will molest and then [[forever alone|make out with a couch cushion]] 
*'''Vomit''' The bird will go into convulsions which are slightly reminiscent of throwing up
*'''Hump''' Chicken will make a motion which could be construed as humping the air.
*'''Money''' Subservient Chicken shows exactly [[in the ass|where he will let you put it]] for [[jewgold|cash]]
