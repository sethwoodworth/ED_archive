'''Christine O'Donnell''' (a.k.a. '''Epic Fail Girl''') is the latest [[Tea Party]] darling who -like her role model [[Sarah Palin]]- suddenly [[UFO|appeared from nowhere]]- in the Summer [[2010]] winning the [[GOP]] primary in [[Delaware]] [[Shit nobody cares about|for the Republican Party's Senate omnomnomination on the ballot for the 2010 November mid-term elections.]] 

[[File:Pinky-And-The-Brain.jpg|thumb|This is what Christine believes [[scientists]] are making.]]

The fact that she's a completely [[batshit insane]] attention whore with a tiny, tiny brain and a super crazy platform that includes classifying [[fapping]] as tantamount to adultery in God's eyes didn't seem to set off any [[ZOMG|red flags]] to voters (despite making the establishment [[GOP]] [[shit bricks]]) and won in a landslide is a frightening indictment of the [[Red State]] American mindset. O'Donnell also believes in all sorts of other crazy shit like that she once dabbled in [[wicca|witchcraft]] during which time she once made out with someone (who was presumably a [[Goth]]) on a [[Satan]]ic altar covered in blood and that [[scientists]] have been [[LOL WUT|mating mice with humans to give mice human brains]].

==Her Platform==
[[File:God-kills-kitten.jpg|thumb|What may have motivated her to take an [[Every time you masturbate...God kills a kitten|anti-fap platform]]]]

[[File:Odonnellbj.jpg|thumb|She totally [[asking for it|asked for it]]]]

O'Donnell is a [[virgin|abstinence-only]], [[homophobic|anti-gay]], [[alt porn|anti-porn]], [[NO U|anti-masturbation platform]] advocate and it's has worked out as well for her in practice as in preachability. She also believes that [[lol wut|''condoms cause aids.'']] But O'Donnell is no Palin clone. For one thing, we know for sure that O'Donnell, who was born in [[New Jersey]] in 1969, is a bona fide member of [[Gen X]]. Even if she continues to come across like a wacky, sanctimonious wingnut, it could be in a distinctly Gen X way. 

She also presents herself as a Jew who wants to balance the budget to wipe out the current national deficit and create jobs, however records show that not only has she not had a job for the last 10 years, (reporting only $5,000 on her tax filings) she's also cheated on her taxes and been [[stripper|unable to pay her own bills]].

==Attention Whoring==
Whilst it may seem that this [[lesbo|childless, unmarried 40-year-old virgin]] is a newcomer to the national spotlight, it most certainly is not what it seems. In fact, during her [[attention whoring]] teens she was all over TV on shows like [[Bill Maher]]'s ''"Politically Incorrect"'' and [[MTV]]'s ''"Sex In The 90's"'' advocating for abstinence and providing the Internets with a veritable smorgasbord of lulzy clips to put in this article. There is so much shit on this nutjob that Bill Mahrer has threatened to put out a new clip every day until she comes on his new show.

In a 1997 interview in the Washington Times, she said that after her antiabortion views got her booed at Harvard, she detected not anger but hurt in the crowd and "cried out to God to use me to [[molestation|touch that generation]]."

==[[Karl Rove]]==

Her main nemesis right now is not anyone on [[libtards|the left]] as you might suppose but Neocon [[Nerd Rage|hawk]] [[Karl Rove]] who pretty much ran the country for 8 years using [[W]] as a [[sockpuppet]]. In an interview with [[Faux News]], Rove slammed her as a kook and was deeply [[butthurt]] when she won her primary. You see, to the Republican establishment, all these teabagger nuttters are a threat to the [[GOP]] taking back the US Senate and House of Representatives in November since having such dingbats on the ballot will turn off any moderate Republicans and/or those with half a brain.

==October Surprise==
After her victory in the Republican primaries, O'Donnell has run on the platform of "I'm [[you]]" in the run-up to the November elections. Of course, [[Haters gonna hate|scoffers gonna scoff]], but this now turns out to be [[Centipedes|more likely than you think]], as Christine O'Donnell becomes the first Senate candidate ever to use an [[Antoine Dodson|internet meme in a campaign ad]].

===October Surprise Deux: Brace For Lulz===

<center><youtube>j-8kAVwO3ZA</youtube></center>

In late October, 2010, O'Donnell provided major [[lulz]], [[ROFL|IRL ROFLs]] and gasps of disbelief when she appeared in a debate with Democratic rival Chris Coons (a lawyer). In front of an audience comprised largely of legal scholars and law students well versed in [[SFB|Constitutional Law]] at Widener University Law School, Epic Fail Girl appeared completely confused about the separation of [[religion|church]] and [[government|state]] clause contained in the [[First Amendment]] of the [[Constitution]] of the United States -a document that she would be sworn to uphold as a US Senator.

{{quote|Where in the Constitution is separation of church and state?|Christine O'Donnell}}

{{quote|[[facepalm|The First Amendment establishes a separation]].|Chris Coons}}

{{quote|The First Amendment does? ... So you're telling me that the separation of church and state is in the First Amendment?|Christine O'Donnell}}

Since it's already been established that she's a [[batshit crazy|complete wingnut]] who speaks out of her arse, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise. However, she claims she holds a degree in Constitutional Government from [[University of Phoenix|Claremont University]] where she was majoring in English and communications in LA. Claremont, however, has no record of her ever having been there. 

In fact, beyond graduating high school, her whole alleged eduction seems to be as mythical as the witch she once aspired to be. Although she did indeed attend Fairleigh Dickinson University majoring in [[drama|theatre]], she didn't graduate (as she has claimed). That didn't stop her from attending the 1993 graduation ceremony. Furthermore, FDU had to sue her for $5,000 in unpaid tuition fees. She also claims that she attended both the [[1337]] American college [[Harvard|Princeton]] and the Ã¼ber 1337 [[university|Oxford University]] in the UK. Naturally, neither of these esteemed educational establishments [[liar|have ever heard of her]].
