'''Robert "Clod" Green''' was the goalkeeper for [[England]]'s 2010 [[World Cup]] squad. On June 12, [[2010]] Green allowed a weak [[Americunt]] shot at the goal to dribble into the net as he crawled around on his hands and knees like a [[Deeker|retarded baby]] to tie the opening game in their group, a match that odds-on favourites England had dominated from the jump. This [[SFB|grave error]] of judgement was reminiscent of the infamous 1986 [[Bill Buckner]] flub where a weakly hit ball off the bat of New York Met Mookie Wilson rolled through the first baseman's legs allowing the Mets to rally for the victory and win the [[World Series]].

Although the game ended in a [[boring|1-1 tie]], it was seen as a [[pwnt|national disaster]] in England and [[great success]] for team USA to the point where '''1-1''' became a 'victory' for the Americans, who [[lol|did not notice]].

The collective [[butthurt|moans and groans]] from English pubs could be heard around the world and at the conclusion of the game England fans went [[berserk]], rioting in the streets and setting fire to everything in their path. [[The Queen]] of England immediately [[permab&]] Green from England for life and put a bounty on the head of the English squad's [[Wop]] coach '''Fabio Capello''' for opting to go with a [[n00b]] goalie over the squad's veteran goalkeeper David James on only two hours notice.

===The Hand of God===
{{main|The Hand of Dios}}
The moment of fail was almost immediately dubbed '''The Hand of Clod''' by England's [[old media]]. This is an allusion to the infamous '''[[Miracles|Hand of God]]''' incident near the end of the [[England]] v [[Argentina]] quarter-finals match of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico where a [[cheating]] Argentinian circus midget by the name of Diego Maradona scored the winning [[handjob|'goal']] that knocked England out of the tournament (which Argentina eventually won). Maradona claimed that his goal was aided and abetted by [[God]] who temporarily made the referee blind so he couldn't see Maradona using his [[NFL|hands]] to 'score'.

===Other Factors===
It should be noted that England [[fail|losing in the World Cup]] is not exactly shocking and/or news. In fact, the country that invented the game of football has won the World Cup a total of '''1''' (as in '''one''') time since the tournament started in 1930 and that was in 1966 against [[Germany]] on home turf in [[London]]. Apart from that, the closest they've come to drinking lukewarm beer <s>from the coveted trophy</s> ([[wikipedia:FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy#FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy|the trophy isn't actually a cup]]) in the other 12 attempts was getting to fourth place in 1990, so the only crown they can truly lay claim to in their national pastime is as the [[EFG|Epic Fail Guys]] of football; they're like the [[fail|Chicago Cubs]] on a global scale.

Much has also been made of the newly designed ball -the Jabulani. Redesigned by the [[German]] sporting goods manufacturer '''adidas''' to perform well in the crazy extremes of [[South Africa]]n weather -hot and cold, rain and sun- and at the different altitudes of the different venues it has excelled only as a [[drama-generating technique]] and [[buzzkill]] that evokes [http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-0609-new-world-cup-ball-20100609,0,3826360.story massive amounts of butthurt] from everyone who isn't sponsored by adidas. 

{{tinyquote|It's very weird. All of a sudden it changes trajectory on you. It's like it doesn't want to be kicked … like someone is guiding it.... It's supernatural.|[http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-0609-new-world-cup-ball-20100609,0,3826360.story Luis Fabiano]|Brazilian striker}}

{{tinyquote|The other ball is like a nagging woman: you kick her and she's still there.|[http://www.fastcompany.com/1659899/keeper-blames-ball-adidas-blames-keeper-whats-the-jabulani-story Felipe Melo]|Brazilian midfielder}}

Clearly, the Jabulani is yet another German attempt at [[trolling IRL]] and next to the Jews and the French, there's nobody Germany hates more than the English. This is obvious since '''adidas''' were [http://foreign.peacefmonline.com/sports/201006/47947.php quick to blame] Robert Green [[inb4|before]] the ball gets blamed by the [[idiot|clod]].

==Jokes==

The Internets has reacted to Robert Green's [[ZOMG|catastrophic error]] with [[lulz|typical sympathy]]. Here are the best of the jokes so far.

* If only [[Tiger Woods|John Terry]] had lived next door to Robert Green's wife.

* Why is Robert Green like [[TV|ITV HD]]? They both switch off at the crucial moment.

* What does Robert Green do after winning the World Cup? [[console|Drops his controller]].

* At least that's one [[BP|British spillage]] the Americans won't be moaning about...

* What's the difference between Robert Green and [[Justin Bieber]]? Robert Green knows how to drop his balls.

* [[Kermit]] was right: It's not easy being Green.

* All these Rob Green jokes are getting out of hand. In fact they're [[pun|crossing the line]].

* The England lads had a get-together after the game and bought Robert Green a drink to commiserate. He spilled it.

* Team captain Steven Gerrard said: "The whole team is behind Rob Green." With hindsight, that's a good place to stand.

* Robert Green's bringing out his own South African trumpet. It's known as a boo-boozela

* Robert Green - a joke even Americans can understand.

* Yesterday at London Zoo one of the staff let a a Central American monkey slip out of his grasp. So Robert Green's not the only English keeper to drop a Howler.

* My computer's got the Robert Green [[virus]]. It can't save anything.

* Just bought a Robert Green [[condom]]. Extra slippery and you're guaranteed not to catch anything.

* Before he got into football, Robert Green was a bus driver. But he got fired because he couldn't make any stops.

* I'm Robert Green and cleaning [[Windows]] is my next idea.

* Robert Green couldn't catch [[Herpes]] in a brothel.

==Robert Green: [[INAM]]==

[[File:Beckham mfw.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[mfw|Beckham's face when]] he saw the Hand of Clod.]]
[[File:Green exploitable temp.png|thumb|[[oh exploitable|oh sooo exploitable.]]]]‎
Although Robert Green couldn't tend a goal if it was the size of an [[ice hockey]] net, the man is like some kind of motherfucking [[IRL super hero]] with a [http://www.yourdictionary.com/zelig Zelig-like] knack of turning up throughout history to save the day (or not). He has an uncanny knack of being in the right place at the right time - or in the [[wrong location nigger|wrong place at the right time]]. 

In this [[meme]] that originated on [[4chan]]'s [[sports|/sp/]] board, the [[oh exploitable]] template of Green fully extended as if actually making an attempt to [[fukken saved|save]] a shot on goal from scoring is [[shooped]] onto pix of [[old meme|historic events]] such as the Hindenburg airship disaster and the US Marine Corps raising the Stars & Bars on [[Japan|Iwo Jima]].

===Beckham Mini-Meme===
A secondary mini-meme that appeared simultaneously is one that shows a [[reaction face]] shoop of [[old|David Beckham]] looking alarmed and glum that was taken from the broadcast of the game when the camera panned to the England bench and caught Beckham (who is not on the team due to being an old man) looking of disgusted. [[Keanu Reeves]] has also strangely started popping up in both these memes.

<center>{{fv|WMGvids|background-color:#B8B8B8;|font-weight:bold;|'''WTF'''<br><youtube>NyJ1riaAHo0</youtube>|<br><youtube>AFRGGLRszOY</youtube>|}}</center>

===[[Copypasta]]===
Robert Green waited. The [[Vuvuzela]] above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were Americans in the field. He didn't see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Fabio Capello were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.

Robert was a goalkeeper for eleven years. When he was young he watched a football match and he said to dad "I want to stand in the goal daddy." Dad said "[[No]]! You will GET GOALS BY AMERICANS." There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got older he stopped. But now in the goal of the Royal Bafokeng Stadium he knew there were Americans.

"This is Beckham" the radio crackered. "You must fight the Americans!"

So Robert put on his goalkeeper gloves and ordered up the defensive line. "HE'S GOING TO KILL US" said the Americans "I will shoot at him" said Donovan and he fired the [[wikipedia:Adidas_Jabulani|Jabulani]]. Terry blocked at him and tried to blow him up. But then the vuvuzelas fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.

"No! I must kill the Americans" he shouted. The radio said "No, Robert. You are the Americans." [[LOL WUT|And then Robert was Clint Dempsey]].

==Bel-Air==

Now this is a story all about how,<br>
My life got flipped, turned upside-down,<br>
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there,<br>
I'll tell you how I became a complete and utter failure.<br>

In the World Cup with England, made to play,<br>
In the area was where I spent most of my games,<br>
Chilling out, catching, relaxing all cool,<br>
With Americans shooting balls at my goal,<br>
When Clint Dempsey, he was up to no good,<br>
Started making trouble with my defenders,<br>
I let in one little shot and Capello got scared,<br>
And said "You're moving back with Avram Grant in West Ham"<br>

I whistled for a plane, and when it came near,<br>
The side of it said "BA" and there was a dice in the mirror<br>
If anything I thought that this plane was rare<br>
But I thought "Naw, forget it, yo homes to West Ham"<br>

I pulled up to the ground about seven or eight,<br>
and I yelled to the pilot "Yo homes, smell ya later"<br>
Looked at the stadium, I was finally there,<br>
To sit on my throne, as an utter failure<br>
