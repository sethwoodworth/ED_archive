I GOT NORTON!
I GOT NORTON! Is a [[meme]] that sprung up on [[b|/b/]] shortly after an image depicting a [[retarded|friendly]] chat between two [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] [[WOW]]fags was posted on [[7chan]]'s /b/. [[Anonymous]] instantly began inquiring as to HOW THIS [[Nigra|NIGRA]] GOTZ DEM INFOMASHUNZ. Eventually, the conversation tunred to "Oh Lawd! This man needz moar medalz!" and Anonymous ended by declaring I GOT NORTON a meme. Its creation is depicted in the screen shot below:

==="u cant hack or nothin, I got norton"===
The initial post carried a screencap of the conversation between the two, in the middle of [[Shit nobody cares about|an apparent trade/transaction of a player character/account and all the dumbass "+9000 Sword of Pwning" shit that WOWfags cream over.]] However, as the two haggle and deal,  it is revealed that one of the participants, a WoWfan4life, is attempting fraud by asking to [[Bullshit|"check out the account" and try it out before purchasing.]] In good faith, and [[Retard|against better judgement]], afullmoon1 agrees, and is promptly scammed by the other WoWfag. WoWfan4life, believing himself to be the [[Winnar|winrar]], laughs as afullmoon1 scrambles to regain his lost <s>honour</s> account. But afullmoon1 is smarter than your average Wowfag, and in one of the lulziest maneuvers ever performed by anyone (excluding the time-honoured [[barrel roll]]) grabs the other WoWfag's OrgName, OrgID, IRL Address, City, State, Country, and Phone number. Lulz ensue.

As afullmoon1 threatens to retaliate, WoWfan4life laughs, using the now famous, "stupid ass u cant hack or nuthin" "I GOT NORTON" HOLY.FUCKING.SHIT. 

He Fucking has NORTON. 

Eventually, afullmoon1 CALLS HIS FUCKING PHONE NUMBER. Wowfan4life shits bricks, and all sense of Internet tough guy bravado fails him. He begs afullmoon1 to "please please don't call." As afullmoon1 challenges his manliness to ANSWER THE FUCKING PHONE WoWfan4life replies "cuz dude my mom"

Eventually, the conversation came down to WoWfan4life begging afullmoon1 not to call the [[party van]], and that he was just joking. Finally, afullmoon1 delivered the coup de grace:

===Enter Anonymous===
Anon discovered everything they could about how afullmoon1 did it, how to do it, and then did it on each other for [[great justice]].

Eventually, /b/ went back to [[rape|doing what it]] [[Loli|had always done]].
