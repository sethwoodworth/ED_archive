You Bawww, You Lose

[[Anonymous]] is infamous for occupying the [[4chan|cold, heartless, cruel, bitch-trenches of the internets]], but some evidence has shown that, on rare occassions, [[LOLWUT|even /b/ has a heart]].

Following suit of the [[crap|classic]] [[You Laugh, You Lose]] threads, the [[lame|spin-off]] You [[Bawww]], You Lose features [[depression|depressing]] images posted in order to invoke emotion from Anon. [[bullshit|This differs from other subsets of YLYL because it requires slightly moar creativity to be effective]], instead of just posting [[newfags|examples of retardation]] to incur the [[RAGE|wrath of Anon]] or mass [[pr0n]] spamming to induce [[fapping]].

Still, [[some argue|many agree]] that these threads are the example of [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|the cancer]], while [[oldfags|others]] hold firm to the belief it is a [[shit nobody cares about|nostalgic staple of /b/]]. On the [[penis|third hand]], though, some Anon think the purpose of the threads backfire, and instead find them to be a bigger source of [[lulz]] than the [[irony|thread's original counterpart]].

==List of things /b/ BAWWWs to==
