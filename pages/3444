Gossip Girl
Is a [[shitty]] teen drama marked by it's overfunded production, uncreative storylines, and [[duh|OBVIOUS]] lampshade-hanging. Once again a creation of [[media|bastardizing a decent franchise]] like every other movie/tv show/dog[[shit]] that comes out these-days, the writers are obviously [[Twilight|chimps]] desperate to keep viewers and ratings (aka their [[jewgold|paycheck]]) so they spoon feed everything fans/viewers notice and complain about. There is no interesting plot, no character development, and no dimensional chracters for that matter seeing as if a person [[irl]] were to go through what the characters go through; they would be in permanent [[insane|therapy]].

==Gossip Girl in a nutshell==
Is about a bunch of [[white]] [[rich]] [[teenagers]] living in [[New York]] who wallow so deeply in their own filthy wealth, stepping outside of their world is comparable to us and [[Africa]]. Constantly being [[stalker|stalked]] by Gossip Girl, a website dedicated to keep the gossip mill churning who apparently has more undercover agents/cameras/and leaks than the [[CIA]], [[KGB]], [[Facebook]] and [[Big Brother]] combined. Okay with the constant stalkage, assuming [[drugs|since everybody else is, it's okay]]; the characters pretend the website is merely another aspect of their lives despite the fact the creator of the website is [[stalker|still anonymous, won't be revealing themselves, and has been running the website]] for [[over 9000]] years. Everyone has a vendetta against everyone, everyone fucks everyone, and everyone is related to everyone. If Gossip Girl were a War, the world would be [[divide by zero|destroyed]] in less than a minute.
In order to keep things interesting, the writers enjoy bastardizing perfectly okay [[irl]] subjects like [[France]], [[hipsters|NYU]], [[boring|GOOD movies & literature]], [[rich|big business world]], [[shit nobody cares about|politics]], and [[gay|fashion]] to crush and pasteurize into substance to feed to [[myspace|insecure]] [[16 year old girls]]. Constantly creating drama for the Chuck/Blair Chair ship and only using the other characters to create intense tension between them, the show is literally a slave to its viewers and what the viewer's want.

How to use this chart? Following the lines/dots until it comes back full circle. For example:
Serena fucked Carter who also fucked Blair who's been fucking Chuck who fucked 9000 prostitutes who also all fucked his buddy Nate who fucked a lonely housewife called Duchess Catherine who was also fucking Lord Marcus who fucked Blair who's constantly fighting with Jenny who wants to fuck Nate who fucked Serena at least 100 times.

==The [[attention whores|Characters]]==

===[[STD|Serena VD Woodsen]]===
Is a [[idiot]] [[blonde]] [[whore]] who's constantly [[asking for it]] yet [[troll's remorse|freaks out when she gets it]]. She has the attention span of a four year old, considering she can only [[OH MAN OH GOD|juggle one emotion at a time]]. One day she can be sad because she breaks up with [[hipster|Dan]] but two hours later is in [[love]] because she's fucking [[dumbass|Nate]]. Then two days later, she runs off to another guy and is willing to sacrifice anything for him, only to break down but then be happy again because she's fucking more dudes. Too stupid to be [[Paris Hilton]], not enough of a druggie to be [[Lindsay Lohan]], and too old and used to be a [[Miley Cyrus]], and too boring to be a successful [[camwhore]], Serena will most likely end up popping out puppies for a abusive Jew while she desperately gets plastic surgeries to keep the one redeeming quality she has; her <s>looks</s>[[boobs]].

===[[Sociopath|Blair]]===
Is a sociopathic materialistic [[Jewess]] hungry for power and being treated like royalty. She's into [[sickfuck|kinky sex]] with her [[pimp|boyfriend]] Chuck which includes roleplaying in [[furry|russian fur suit whatever that is]] and using [[kinky|handcuffs]]. Apparently unable to break her old habits (and doesn't care to try), she should just become a [[kinky|dominitrix]] while she still has time to escape. She forces random girls to be her minions; most of them being [[insecure]] and is comparable to a [[Hitler|tyrant]] who shoots all who oppose and has [[over 9000]] harems of girls at disposal. 

===[[Idiot|Nate]]===
Needs to be lead around on a leash, has feelings for [[slut|everything that moves]], and can only think far ahead enough to be easily [[pwned]] by others. Easily [[trolled]] and easily [[butthurt]], the only reason why such a idiot exist must be some [[ebonics|wack daddy shit ass]] [[weed]] that pwned his brain.

===[[Troll's remorse|Chuck]]===
Suffers from serious cases of [[troll's remorse]] seeing as he is the only character intelligent enough to successfully maneuver his world, not be phased, and still get the last [[lulz]]. Yet falls into depths of [[BAW|depression]] when he realizes his dad harbors a grudge against him, dies and becomes CEO of a empire, also getting [[pwned]] by his [[Jewess]] girlfriend, and abandoned again by his mom. Viewers think this developed him into a dimensional character; actually most likely Chuck will become [[an hero]] after his first [[prostitute|wife]] divorces him and takes his money, seeing as he [[pimp]]ed his girlfriend for his empire.

===[[Hipsters|Dan & Vanessa]]===
Are two best friends who both want to become [[unrealistic expectations|famous writers/film makers]]. Constantly bastardizing and throwing references to classic intelligent movies/books but choosing to write stories/screenplays about [[high school|love]] and [[livejournal|rejection]]. Vanessa comes from a family of [[niggers]] trying to get [[liberal|back to their roots]] and Dan comes from a family of [[emo|creative artists]] including his [[whore|artist mother]], [[indie|musician father who likes Sonic Youth]], and [[16 year old girl|fashion designer sister]]. In real life, people like Dan and Vanessa would shun their parents, escape to [[hipster|Portland or LA]], waste their money on [[art school]] and become crazy [[poor]] artists who will [[die alone]].

===[[16 year old girl|Jenny]]===
Is the only redeeming character but writers ruined her as well. Being told she's [[suburbs|ungrateful]] for having the oppurtunity to attend a elite private school, Jenny has no choice but to deal with her classmates seeing as there are no [[nerds]] to hang out with other than her brother. While most people in this position buckles up, study hard and gets into a good [[Yale|college]], [[BAW|and complain about their problems on the internet]], Jenny becomes a [[sociopath]]ic [[whore]] like a combination of Blair & Serena but looks like Courtney Love. Becoming [[poser]][[punk]] and eventually fucking the dude who tried to force it on her when she was a [[loli]].

#Rumor about Serena having a STD; previous complaints about how since everyone fucks everyone someone should have gotten an STD by now
#"She (Gossip Girl) even made a chart (to show who fucked whom)"; chart was made numerous times on forums oti
#After continuing with the Chuck/Jenny storyline, Chuck's previous "attempt" with Jenny was obviously ignored. Users online complained, then in an recent episode, this was brought into the light.
#"Who slept with Dan, Nate, and Chuck, who slept with Blair... who slept with Serena blah blah" bringing in light of the massive [[orgy]] that is GG
#Blair/Chuck ship name: [[Chair]]
