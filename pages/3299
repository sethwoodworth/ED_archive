Georgia
Georgia is an unofficial state of [[America]] in the [[cock|Caucasus]] Mountains containing 4.3 million [[Fact|Stalins]]. Known as [[wut|Sakartvelobantustan]][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakartvelobantustan] in their native tongue but known as [[Failorgia]] by everyone else. See [[South Ossetia]] to find out about the time Georgia poked [[Russia]] and got [[butt-rape|defeated]]. The leader of Georgia is a [[lolcow]] by the name of [[Mikhail Saakashvili]].

Georgians first had some independent kingdoms in the land, and were [[lie|great warriors]] despite being dominated at one point or another first by [[Mongolia|Mongoloid]] Azn beasts, then by the subhuman [[Turkey|Turks]], then [[Iran]], and finally, the [[Russia|Russofags]]. However, one thing stands out: they were among the first [[Christianity|Christfags]] ever, having been converted by some slut named [[Shit nobody cares about|Saint Nino]]. But what's more to expect from Jew little fucks?

When the evil Soviet Empire fell apart, the Georgians voted for independence. However, tragedy soon struck, as the Russkies wanted their empire back, and supported anyone who tried to gain independence due to the fact that their sacred basked-weaving traditions were slighly different. The Russians were upset since Georgia refused to suck Russia's dick and wanted to join the [[NATO|North Atlantic Terrorist Organization]]. What makes this a dilemma is that it is hard for the average person to take sides, since everyone on both sides is technically white.

In 2008, the Georgians tried to take back a seperatist enclave called [[South Ossetia]]. Basically, they bombed and shelled an entire city, and then invaded and began the harrowing task of ethnically cleansing the native population. However, they made the mistake of killing 10 Russian peacekeepers who were protecting the innocent. As a result, Russia attacked and quickly pushed the Georgian forces out of South Ossetia, also pushed the Georgians out of the seperatist region of [[moonspeak|Abkhazia]], and then sent its troops [[Sex|inside]] of Georgia where they stole a bunch of military shit and chased the Georgian Army back to the capital without a fight.
