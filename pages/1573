'''Chronic Troll Syndrome''' (CTS) is an internet disease (not to be confused with [[Internet Disease]]) that is generally present in [[trolls]]. It causes the given [[troll]] to be unable to tell the difference between [[internet]] and [[IRL]] limits. 

As a result, [[Asperger's syndrome|the troll is no longer able to comprehend what is appropriate to say and do]] when dealing with [[IRL]] people in contrast with the [[Internets]]. Symptoms include being inconsiderate and generally asshatty to friends and family, the common offensive use of racial epithets, and a tendency to interfere in other people's business uninvited "for the [[lulz|laughs]]." This in turn leads to a loss of said friends, black person and a general alienation of all contacts outside of the Internet with the added bonus of [[pwned|having the shit kicked out of you]] and serious [[Party Van|jail time]].

=== Treatment ===

Chronic Troll Syndrome is easily cured by having said [[troll]] call a black person a black person on the street, or refer to all of their gay friends as [[fags]]. The resulting ass-beating will generally shock the troll back into recognition of boundaries. However, if a case has continued untreated for long enough, this treatment may prove ineffective and only encourage the said [[troll]]. Additional loss of job, limbs, marital status, and life may be necessary for more advanced cases. It is also possible to limit the damage by simply making sure that the [[troll]] has no [[IRL]] friends that (s)he can offend. This is clearly not the most desirable solution, but an inevitable one if cases continue long enough without proper care. Researchers have been trying since [[at least 100 years ago]] to find a 100% effective, ideal cure for CTS, but they have not yet been successful.

In extreme cases, the afflicted [[troll]] may begin using "[[I did it for the lulz]]" in order to attempt to justify inconsiderate [[IRL]] actions. If said symptom arises, it is suggested that the troll be [[slain]] immediately.

== Exceptions ==

As with most rules there are exceptions. IRL trolling and racism can also lead to extremely effective and hilarious results. Remember that not all niggers and jews that you may decide to troll IRL are as thick as they seem. So troll with caution. This method can lead to some of the most satisfying results imaginable or one of the worst experiences said CTS sufferers may go through.

== Everything is a Troll ==

Another implication of CTS is that the affected individual tends to think every anti-social act, whether it be [[IDIFTL|for the lulz]], due to [[butthurt|insecurities]], or a CYA maneuver, is a troll. By this way of thinking, every attempt at offending another, for whatever reason, even if unsuccessful, becomes a troll. [[Roman Polanski]] pedobaiting the [[Party Van]]? Troll. Adolf Hitler killing all the Jews? Troll. Jews doing WTC? You guessed it, a troll. 

Although it's arguable whether or not the last case was a lulzy troll, still, a real troll does it for the lulz.

== Known Cases ==
There have been spotted and probably outbreaks of CTS. Any such outbreak should be taken SRSLY and u will need to fill out forms with the [[The Man|CDC and DHS]]. This is an pandemic, on the level of [[Azn|SARS and H1N1]].
