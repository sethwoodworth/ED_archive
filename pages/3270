'''Gemma Anscomb''' is a [[fucktard]]ed [[16-year-old girl]] from a shithole in Middle [[England]] who became famous after [[advertising]] that her parents' home was free for a party using [[Bebo]], and like [[Corey Delaney]], caused major [[lulz]] because people who realized how [[exploitable]] this [[party girl]] was came to the house and trashed it.

Among the lulzworthy things that happened were group [[secks]] in an 8-year-old's bedroom (seriously, that's true - you couldn't make this shit up if you tried, could you?), [[drug]] taking and attempts to [[David Motari|sacrifice a dog]]. These black person [[furry|beasts]] were compared to animals by the [[butthurt]] parents who contemplated becoming [[an hero]]es over their total [[fail|incompetence]] at raising their naive little <s>daughter</s> slut, who is now in hiding after passing out [[drunk]] at the [[epic]] party which went on into the [[Rape Clock|early hours]] without her knowledge as she lay unconscious.

This was reported in the [[old media|media]], and fucktards at the ''[[tabloid|Daily Mail]]'' starting [[BAWWWWW]]ing over the [[shit nobody cares about|state of Modern Britain and what this event says about society]].

Goodness knows what we could come home to.]]|color=#7EC0EE}}

==Plot Synopsis==
[[Image:PartyDM2802 468x296.jpg|thumb|Some ED users could drink this much and then be able to write a [[featured article]] on [[Wikipedia]] from scratch.]]
[[Image:Anscombhome.jpg|thumb|Julia and Robert Anscomb's house had [[vandalism|graffiti]] scrawled on the walls and [[ruin|totally wrecked]] rooms]]
Gemma seemed like a nice [[loli|little girl]] to her [[mundane|middle-class parents]]. She [[fag|got good grades]] in [[school]], and [[lie|because good grades in school are obviously an indicator of <s>intelligence</s> <s>maturity</s> anything]] generally this family thought that by going away to celebrate her father's birthday by watching the [[Monty Python]] musical ''[[spam|Spamalot]]'', it would be OK to leave her in control of the [[house]], because she's mature and streetwise enough, right? [[Wrong]].

Clearly, she's not very [[internets]]-wise. Did she not hear the story of Corey a couple of months beforehand? Anyway, she was [[chav|dumb enough]] to put her [[dox|irl home address]] onto Bebo, and to [[asking for it|ask]] people she didn't know to come there for a party. She later [[almost raped|paid the price]], and it [[ruin|severed]] the relationship that Gemma and her mother had. Latest reports suggest that Gemma is still [[delete fucking everything|in hiding]].

Basically, the parents came home to find a [[pwnt|trashed]] house, with [[over 9000|Â£25,000 pounds' worth of damage]] to household furniture, kitchen equipment and the carpets were soaked with shit, blood and cum. But that was only the tip of the [[global warming|iceberg]].

{{quote|Pointing to her own [[king]]size bed in the [[sysop|master]] bedroom, she declared: "There were six people in there having sex at one time. We feel totally [[butthurt|violated]]."
[[Image:Anal violated.jpg|thumb|left|150px|"We feel totally violated."]]

Elsewhere in the Anscombs' smart "newly decorated" [[chav|semi]] in Worthing were traces of [[drugs|cocaine, marijuana]] - and enough empty [[booze|vodka and rum bottles]] to [[NOM NOM NOM|fill a recycling plant]].

Two [[computer|laptops]] were also stolen, along with an [[iPod]], expensive jewelery and a passport. Oh yes, and [[Phone sex|57 calls were made using the house phone]].|What Julia Anscomb had to say about it.|color=#7EC0EE}}

Anyway, using her extensive [[whore|whoring]] techniques on Bebo, Gemma managed to lure [[at least 100]] people to the party, and showed no remorse afterwords because she wasn't really conscious to experience the party, because she passed out [[drunk]] ''really'' fucking early.

Apparently, some older [[teen]]s, some as old as [[pedo|25]], turned up at this party, from as far away as [[Scotland|the other side of England]]! Things got [[epic|wild]], and the [[switch police on|police]] were called by [[HAGGER|haggardly]] [[old]] neighbors who couldn't sleep, but they were too fucking dumb to realize what was going on and let the party [[win|continue]].

{{quote|"There were males just wandering around in their [[faggotry|boxer shorts or completely naked]]," said one [[chav|young man]] who gatecrashed the party after finding out about it through word of mouth on the day.

"I saw a [[whores|couple]] having [[sex]] on the washing machine and there were [[orgy|five or six girls and lads rolling around in the double bed upstairs]]. It was like watching a [[porn]] movie.

"This wasn't just teenagers. There were people in their [[pedo|20s]] as well. Most of them [[ignorance|didn't even know]] whose house it was. I didn't stay long, but I was there long enough to see what was going on."

Another gatecrasher, Sean [[Irish|O'Brien]], a 25-year-old [[chav|plumber]], found out about the party on the internet. He arrived at 7pm and stayed until 7am.

"I saw [[epic win|one man have sex with three women]] on the washing machine. At about 2am, I went into one of the bedrooms and saw [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|two boys have sex]]. Everything was going on."

When asked if he took part, he replied: "[[rule 34|We all got involved]]."|color=#7EC0EE}}

After that, [[cumdumpster|Gemma Anscomb]] awoke from her [[Rohypnol|slumber]], and got a [[reality]] check, and realized her [[fail]]ure as a human being which will continue to [[Pokemon|haunt 'er]] for years. [[Fred Phelps]] has condemned Gemma Anscomb to [[hell]] for hosting a party which featured such utter faggotry and [[epic fail]] as two guys having sex with each other. I mean, come on, [[srsly]], they're supposed to do that [[shit]] at their own [[fapping|discretion]], or at least in [[Olympics|teh gay bathhouse]].

==Conclusion==
In conclusion, what we know is that people who take the ''Daily Mail'' as anything other than a trashy tabloid are [[over 9000]] times more harmful to society and the wider world than the people who write articles on ED are, and if you [[fail]] to believe this, you are fucking [[retard]]ed beyond all belief and probably think that <del>[[rape|human rights abuses]] at Guantanamo Bay are [[moralfag|justifiable]] because they happen outside of [[ignorance|Middle England]] and the US, as the eternal ally, could only ever do no harm.</del>  [[Centipede filled vagina|PREACHY POLITICAL WHINING IN MY ED? It's more likely than you think]].

<del>She could also [[profit|benefit]] from learning from a [[Sceptre|nice, intelligent young man]] of the same age - one who is more [[awesome|worldly]] than she is - who might be able to help her [[do a barrel roll|pick up the pieces]] of the broken mess.</del> DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS!
