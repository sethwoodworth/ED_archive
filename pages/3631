Harvard is an American charm school located in Cambridge, [[Massachusetts ]](The most pompous suburb of [[Boston]]). Harvard is peculiar in that it happens to be the oldest [[English]] speaking university in the [[America|United States]], but no one who lives within [[Over 9000|over nine thousand]] miles of it can speak the language properly. For proof just ask your average Bostonian for directions to Harvard's car park.

Harvard is sometimes known for producing American presidents, Fortune 500 CEO's, poets and civil rights leaders, but mostly it's known for creating pretentious douchebags. A Harvard education instills one with the belief that they are more awesome than anything but they shouldn't dare tell anyone.
Notable graduates include [[JFK]], the Roosevelts, that dude from Audioslave, that [[emo]] [[fag]] from [[Fat Larry's Band|Weezer]], Natalie Portman (because she's a prototype for the [[jewish|New World Order's]] master race) Thurston Howell III,"the Unabomber", Captain Crunch and [[Jesus]].
