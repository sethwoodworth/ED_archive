[[Image:Thisisboxxy.png|thumb|The face that launched [[Over 9000|thousands]] of people to [[shit bricks]].]]
'''Boxxy''' is another in a long line of [[chanwhores]] to revolt and/or endear themselves to the [[virgin|lovelorn]] [[basement dwellers]] at [[b/|unoriginalcontent.org]]. 

What initially appeared as a normal, [[attractive]], [[emo]], [[jailbait]] [[Gaia|Gaiafag]] soon transformed into a psychotic, ADD-riddled spastic [[You|which is the dream girl of most chantards]] (but only because most of them have the same personality.) 

In early-January 2009, '''Catherine "Catie" Wayne''' arrived on the scene and promptly fractured the unofficial peace treaty in the ongoing [[arabs|newfag]]/[[jews|oldfag]] [[newfags|(actually all the same)]] wars with her character whom she would later state was intended to be a parody of her younger self. To the [[newfags]] ''-sorry-'' [[newfags|oldfags]], she was representative of everything that is wrong about the '[[new /b/]]' whilst to the ''other'' [[newfags]], she was some kind of poster girl for [[change]] from the [[chin-chan|ugly, vile, disgusting underbelly]] of the Internets that [[Old /b/|/b/ once was]].

Most /b/tards' first encounter with Boxxy was when some [[newfag|wannabe oldfag]] - a [[OC|pioneering]] Boxxy-hater - around New Years 2009, decided to start a "YOU RAGE YOU LOSE"-thread. The OP had Boxxy's face as the thread image, and linked to one of her youtube videos. Needless to say, this wannabe [[rage]]-thread backfired horribly, with the otherwise [[furry|puppy-raping, scat-eating]] [[Anon]] giving responses like "[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|she's kind of cute lol]]". Two years later, with [[AIDS|hourly Boxxy threads]] still trolling [[newfags|oldfags]] into uncontrollable rage fits, it was safe to conclude that the original "rage"-thread may have been one of the biggest [[fail]] threads on the history of the internet as we know it.

__TOC__

== The Beginning ==

Boxxy's videos actually came out a year before this incident. The story starts with a [[Gaia Online]] user, "MoldyLunchBoxx", making a Quest to raise money and buy stuff for her avatar. While collecting donations, she made two vids to her friends, perhaps as some sort of payment. Originally posted in January, 2008 on the [[YouTube]] channel 'boxxybabe', they received little attention for a year till they were embedded onto [[shit no one cares about|I-am-bored.com]] on December 27th, [[2008]]. Soon they were discovered by someone at [[7chan]] and subsequently embedded into the top of their [[b/|/b/]] board. This coincidentally [[came]] at a time that [[4chan]] was down for maintenance and [[7chan]] was flooded with refugees from the former.

When 4chan was back online, Boxxy became an "If your rage you lose" and an "If you fall in love you lose" endurance test. One group of /b/tards lost and fell in love, and the other group of /b/tards lost by raging. The two sets of losers where headed for conflict, egged on by a third group in the middle, neither in love nor exactly raging; but seeing an opportunity for the lulz.

Meanwhile, a bunch of [[newfags]] spammed "4CHAN.ORG LOL I TROLL 1 & 2" in the comments on her videos. Somewhat scared, she closed the "boxxybabe" YouTube account and came to /b/ on January 7th, to lurk about her supposed Queen condition. Suddenly enjoying her 15 minutes of fame, she posted links to two of her pics. Of course, they called her a troll since nobody believed it was really her. So she created a new YouTube account called "boxxybabee" (with two e's) and uploaded her infamous third vid where she acknowledged it was her the one who posted the links to her pics. Brix were shat.

=== (Delicious) Boxxypasta ===

I like Boxxy, and here's why. I'm not post pubescent (over 25), I have a girlfriend, and I don't fantasize about her. I like her because she is the antidote, the antithesis, the hemlock in the cup to Internet Tough Guyism.

I was surprised to see that, for all its posturing, /b/ really does hold one thing sacred: its "bad muthafucka" image of itself. /b/ really believes that it's frightening, that it's tougher than a Ford Chevy, that it's badass masculinity personified, in a sense. And, before, there were very few ways to disrupt this image, to give it a good hard kick in the shins.

And then Boxxy came along. Boxxy love is everything /b/ hates - passive, gentle, adorable, sweet. It gives without asking, it loves without asking in return. Instead of being aggressively faux-adult, it's happily faux-childlike. That's why Boxxy became a meme - because she DIDN'T want the attention; because she provided no pics (as the /b/tards will attest). As a result, Boxxy turned into the most successful way to troll the /b/tards ever devised. It actually makes the gore and violence and sexism and racism fantards squeal, because it hits them where it hurts - in their image of themselves. How can they be tough, scary guys when their favorite hangout is one long love poem to Boxxy love? So that's why I love Boxxy - the sound of /b/'s humiliation is sweet music to my ears.

[[Image:Kill Boxxy.jpg|thumb|left|Somehow I think /b/ was doomed long before Boxxy.]]
[[lies|It may be difficult to believe]], but [[intelligent|some]] people don't like Boxxy. She has been called [[the cancer that is killing /b/]] among other things. Currently [[4chan]] is in [[RAGE]] mode over the fact that on January 10th 2009 at least 50% of the threads on their [[b/|/b/]] board were about Boxxy, either pro or against. This amount of Boxxy on /[[b]]/ caused a war on 4chan that led to them [[an hero|destroying themselves]] for a whole 4 hours due to [[DoS]].

==Boxxy inspires DDoS against [[4chan]]==
[[Image:Boxxy_chemo.jpg|thumb|208px|[[Chemo|The Result]]]]
[[Image:Ddos 4chan boxxy.jpg|thumb|left|208px|[[The Final Solution]]]]

Only some hours after Boxxy uploaded her 3rd vid, /b/ got locked in perma-shitstorm mode while its front page was full of Boxxy threads. While [[Jews|Boxxy lovers]] and [[Arabs|Boxxy haters]] kept fighting, the latter conspired to form a [[DDoS]] attack on [[4chan]] if [[Moot]] did not make Boxxy a bannable offense, or [[BRING BACK SNACKS|bring back Snacks]] and let him sort through all the Boxxy bullshit. Though this same group of people was responsible for half of the Boxxy threads in the first place, the [[irony]] of the situation was lost on the group of [[Retarded|simple-minded]] /b/tards. 

Eventually at 7pm est 1/10/09, [[4chan]] went down, however this [[fail|only lasted about 3 hours]] before it was back up with moar Boxxy [[fanboy|fawning]] and [[hater|aids]] as before. Soon, pretty much two thirds of all /b/ threads were Boxxy threads. After the initial shitstorm of shitposts, however, all Boxxy threads would [[404]] almost instantly, and eventually anything regarding Boxxy would result in a 2 day autoban. The autoban idea was one that [[7chan]] had implemented hours beforehand, which is [[lulz|funny]] considering Boxxy was all their fault to begin with.

[[TL;DR]]: Haters succeded in making Boxxy a bannable offense, reducing the amount of Boxxy threads by DDoS'ing their own chan.

==Gallery of I Hate Boxxy==

Despite the fact that /b/ divided up sides and argued the issue quite angrily, /b/ still came out a winner. Whether one of the "I hate Boxxy" camp, or a member of the "I <3 Boxxy" armies, everyone all got to see some [[cumdumpster|Femanon]] flesh. Nerdy girls around the world felt it was their solemn duty to post their tits and [[Cunt|vaginas]] with the express reason of [[Fact|explaining their feelings]] towards Boxxy. 

Because of Boxxy, /b/ had witnessed more female body parts in 24 hours than they have seen in the previous year, also further proof that deep down, women are jealous attention whores. Below you will find a brief sampling of what was witnessed.

==Hacked==

{{squote|'''<@[[Killhamster]]> "ranking" "investigation" "psychological dominance" these people are way too serious business|[[User:Killhamster|Killhamster]]'''}}
On January 18th, 2009, three weeks after the first appearance of Boxxy, a group of [[namefags]] calling themselves the CBCR ([[Censorship|Center for Boxxy Control and Restriction]]) hacked into Boxxy's [[Youtube]] account by guessing the question to reset the password after breaking into one of email accounts. They privatized her three videos and replaced them with one explaining to Boxxy that she should never make another video again, threatening her with the fact that they have all of her [[IRL]] information. After posting the video they proceeded to hang around the comments on their own accounts bragging to everyone who posted that it was them who hacked into Boxxy's account. Hacking into Boxxy's accounts on any other terms would have been a valiant and noble effort, but the sheer amount of bragging, namefagging and just generally trying to become [[internet celebrities]] off of this has been deemed to be extreme [[faggotry]]. Thus invalidating the act altogether.

Upon reading the above updates, the "[[faggots|hackers]]" responsible for [[white knight]]ing Boxxy by finding her [[docs]] and [[doing it wrong|spreading them all over the internets]], put out another video on Boxxy's account. In said video they contradicted themselves about six times. They explained that they didn't do for [[e-peen|e-cred]], yet called themselves [[martyr]]s in the fight for the internet. In one line they explained that they did it "because she was annoying to not just 4chan, but everyone on the internet" and a couple of lines later they explained "Yeah she was annoying, but she is just a bubbly [[16 year old girl]]"


As you can see by the [[screencap]] on the right, a transcript of said second video was used as the index page for the IP of someone claiming to be the leader of the "[[faggot|hacker]]" organization to take down Boxxy's YouYube and throw her docs all over the tubes. This individual left a crybaby message on this very articles talkpage trying to defend himself and his ''organization'', however, his [[unwarranted self importance]] was not welcome here and he was thoroughly [[pwn|put back in his place]].

Later that same night (actually early that next morning, January 20th, 2009 2 AM EST), Boxxy's YouTube account was reverted back to normal. Her videos were placed back up. The FTP server for the CBCR went down about the same time. [[Zaiger]] was contacted by the CBCR via ED's [[IRC]] server. A severe case of [[troll's remorse]] and extreme [[butthurt]] over not becoming the next [[Weev]] had caused them to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|shut down]] their ''organization'' and abandon their plans to save Boxxy by giving /[[b]]/ her home address and a crowbar.

===July 12th===
[[Image:Oldfag_Threatens_iheartboxxy_admin.jpg|thumb|left|Newfags make Threats.]]
[[Image:Boxxie.JPG|thumb|right|Confirmed Boxxy match.]]
On July 12, 2009, it was discovered that the messageboard "iheartboxxy," a group of Boxxy fans started by an [[User:Angelinriotgear|ED member]] by the name of Overbeing (who later promoted ex-CBCR founder Eyrev to moderator), hosted a small secluded group of people who had found 2 videos of Boxxy (Cate) filmed with a group of friends attending the 2009 Spring California Thespian Festival. These users on the messageboard were known as its "Council." A Council member by the name of Shamage quickly had all of his private information found, and the entire website was threatened by posters on /b/, in an attempt to force them to upload the videos. As an act of solidarity with /b/, and faced with the possibility of escalating conflict, an iheartboxxy admin eventually obliged and uploaded the 2 videos here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheJuly12th.  

Soon after, threads started appearing featuring the New Boxxy, fake Boxxy MySpaces, Facebooks and Instant Messenger accounts. One of which featuring a [http://www.myspace.com/heartpocky Fake Boxxie] with a status with the following "Guys, stop bothering with those videos. I appear for like, 2 seconds in each one."

Partly because she doesn't want to feel like a loser, but also intensely because of the brutal unending onslaught of her 'fans', who like so many rabid subject tore down the castle of her free and easy internet life.

[[Image:Benchriginal.jpg|thumb|right|Boxxy's [[pussy]]]]
Boxxy Peace on 25 July, sequel to BoxxMeet was when a group of about 14 anons met at Robert Doyle Park, in Roseville. They visited her supposed house at 8032 Halseworth Drive and rang the bell, but no one answered. After that they went to her confirmed real house at 202 Pelham Court and were stopped by a chair across the gate. They rang the bell but no one answered, so they left some flowers outside her door saying "Anon". They then talked to one of boxxy's ex boyfriends Dan Birlem, who was her prom date and apparently fucked her, although he failed to admit to it on cam. They decided Boxxy wasn't going to come, so they got frozen yogurt.

===BoxxMass===
Previous to December 26, a sequel to BoxxPeace was planned. Originally called Boxxmass, Boxxy fans were going to gather at Robert Doyle Park, in Roseville and bring gifts for Boxxy. Well known people like Motorcycle-fag and some camwhores showed up. No video or photo evidence was recorded of this event. It was suspected that Anon really did not care about their queen after all.

== New Wave of Pictures ==
Following these videos around 60 previously unseen,[[Image:Killwebs 404.gif|thumb|The Killwebs index page after personal info was leaked. tl;dr [[Cry|BAWWWW]]]] intolerably blurry [[fat|boxxy]] photos were obtained by "Cali4nia" of Killwebs.com.

Five seconds later some [[newfag|boxxyfag]] released unblurry copies without the logo. <s> and [[Butthurt|Killwebs]] attempted to take revenge for having his hard work ruined, by [[Dox|doxing]] those responsible</s> None of this ever happened, lolwtf.

==December 10, 2009 - The shitstorm clouds roll in...==
{{quote|boxxy and boxxybabee are registered trademarks by Lia Dawson & Frank Lawson Network.}}
On December 10, 2009, the [http://youtube.com/user/Boxxybabee Boxxybabee] account and its videos were taken down due to a copyright claim by somebody named Lia Dawson (<s>[http://youtube.com/user/lia YouTube Account]</s> - Suspended) & Frank Lawson. This Lia person claims to know Boxxy and has orders to take all Boxxy-related material on YouTube down (as stated on a video that has since been deleted by lia).

This is all likely to be bullshit, but it has also been discovered that "Boxxy" was a registered trademark of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo Oulipo, Inc]. from 2006 to 2008. This copyright was renewed on December 2nd, 2009. It's unclear if there is any connection to these two events or if anyone [[shit nobody cares about|gives a shit]].

It was eventually discovered by YouTube user ChrissyRin ([http://www.youtube.com/user/chrissyrin YouTube Account]) that "Lia Dawson" is actually a scamming douchebag who attempted to steal Boxxy's account (as well as 20+ others) for his/her own gain.

On December 14th, the boxxybabee account was activated again but without any videos on it. Soon after over the next few days, the videos were completely restored with all the comments intact. According to Lia, this was done at his/her own discretion and they could choose to remove it all once more, if they wish.

Soon after, the Lia account was abandoned by whoever owned it. According to chatter, the account was haxored in early January 2010 and taken over by an unknown party affiliated with [[Tinychan]]. On Janurary 07, 2010, the JewTube account was suspended, along with every other JewTube account linked to this DMCA scammer. It is believed this complete suspension only occurred because the scammer (now known as Xavier) decided to be a complete, moronic douchebag & go onto Twitter to kiss a bunch of JewTube representatives asses (as well as show what he had done), hoping to become one of the site's partners. Within the hour of that conversation occuring, Google & JewTube shut down every JewTube account (well over 20 accounts) & g-mail account connected to him. Every single video & account ever taken down by "Lia", "Frank" & anything connected to "them" was restored.

==March 11, 2010 - The next chapter==
On March 11th 2010, the videos from the original [http://www.youtube.com/user/Boxxybabee Boxxybabee] account were taken down yet again. The only reason stated by JewTube is "This video has been removed due to terms of use violation". All copies on other accounts remain untouched. Two people claimed responsibility for this act. On [http://unichan.org/b/ Unichan], a tripfag who goes by Anon77 (who states he is the actual Anon77 named in the CBRC video), claimed to have fooled JewTube into believing he is Boxxy who has returned to state that the account was hacked and asked for the videos to be removed (This is plausible seeing as how retarded JewTube's support staff are). He even went so far as to make an account with a cheap shooped picture of Boxxy holding up a piece of paper, asking for the account back. The other is a user on JewTube, known as <s>[http://www.youtube.com/user/boxxology Boxxology]</s> (Account closed. User has disappeared.), who has personally lobbied to get the videos taken down, believing the comments and popularity of them to be damaging to Boxxy IRL. They believe that JewTube finally listened to them and removed them. The original videos may never return. It is unknown as to the true reason they were removed.

'''August 7th 2010 account and vids back up.

'''November 2010 vids are down again, probably the work of anon77.

In early 2010, a video containing an alleged conversation with Catie and Nikki surfaced on JewTube. In the video, Catie claimed that she did not want all the attention lavished upon her; particularly since she felt that Boxxy was nothing to be proud of.

==The School Plays==

[[Image:BoxxyLeaveMeAlone.jpg|thumb]]

During Boxxy's senior year in High School, Roseville-native Anons started attending plays for Bawksy at her school. And snapping pictures.

{{quote|That's going the be one of my biggest regrets in life, if I don't rectify it somehow. I was too scared too see her afterwards. I was really glib about it when they announced that you could meet the actors afterwards since I thought I was over her. The first time I looked her into the eyes I was fighting it, saying this is what they teach bartenders, strippers and ricky martin to make it seem they're genuinely into you and not another source of income. The second time it happened she just broke down anything cynical that was happening in my head and I was just happy for the first time in a long while. I was hooked and I wanted it to happen a third time. It didn't happen but I was glad she wasted two seconds of her time just to look at me. As I was leaving I just knew i couldn't go in there, I was sweating bullets my hands were shaking and I probably would've shed a tear thinking do I really want to end this? I wanted to give myself a reason to just see her one more time even though it would be less socially inappropriate at her graduation or dance. I'm smiling just thinking how this girl could do this to me with just a glance.}}

==June 17th 2010==
[[Image:BoxxyReturnFlier.png|thumb]]

In January of 2010, 4chan was spammed with fliers of a supposed return of Boxxy to JewTubes on June 17th, 2010. The original plan was to spam the date everywhere until Bawksy herself would discover it and decide to go along with it and post moar videos of herself on JewTube.

The spam has then bled over to [http://unichan.org/b/ Unichan] and aroused attention amongst Boxxy fans there as well. 

Most Anons decided to stop with the Boxxy stalking if she did not return by then. Others committed themselves to Boxxy for life and decided to get a fitting tattoo. 

Update:
Much to the sadness of boxxyfags & newfags alike, Boxxy did not return as prophecized on June 17th. The entire campaign it seems was unsuccessful, with mentally retarded basement channers attempting to cling to any remaining obsessive humanity they had left.

==An Anonymous Confession==

When will you stop smiling at me?

You know I have that obsession for you. You know that I get torn up inside every time I see that face. Or maybe you don't, and I'm just insane. Either way, I'll just say right out that I love you. There's nobody else I can look at when I'm feeling alone, unloved, and unwanted. You make me feel like a person again, and not some piece of trash thrown out by the rest of the world. I can breathe, feel alive, and be encased in love. I wish I could be with you forever. I would give anything for it. This lonely guy is just begging for it... He dreams about you, you know. Sometimes he can feel your touch, hear your voice, and see your face. The worst part is...

He knows it never happen, and he cries himself back to sleep...

==Boxxy appears on shitty BBC drama==

On the 12th of July, whilst the deaf protagonist is giving some guy a blowjob on a shitty BBC drama called 'The Silence', graffiti saying 'So i herd you liek /b/oxxy' is clearly visible.  Brix were shat.

==Legacy==
Boxxy threads still occasionally materialize on the /b/. The new groundswell of people willing to troll lasted a couple of days and then subsided. Users have simply accepted her undeniable presence that still exists over 4chan whether or not they come to like it (Which would have been cool, if they had done it before matters got out of hand). 
The Youtube remixes and tributes have slowed to a trickle as well although there are a few occasions. 

And please do not make pathetic attempts of revival or reaching out to her such as this poor, miserable soul.

This is obviously an impostor, seeing as how it was posted the day after Halloween, "Boxxy"'s bangs are parted to the wrong side, and there is no [[triforce]] birthmark. However, whether or not the eccentric Moot really chilled with Boxxy, it is clear that he does indeed hold no animosity toward her as a person.

==The Return, AKA Boxxy cashes in.==
[[Image:Boxxys-Inuyasha-Bag.jpg|thumb|center|500px|The bag]]
[[Image:Dday.jpg|thumb|200px|Boxxy wants you to send her your money.]]

On 11/18/10, a date that may live in infamy, the beloved/despised Boxxy returned to the internet. First discovered through the sale of her InuYasha bag on eBay, she posted a picture on Unichan to prove her Boxxiness and begged neck beards to send her their money by posting a timestamped image with her Paypal info. Shitstorms ensued.  While the news of her return spread like wildfire to every chanboard, the skeptics began to accuse the new Boxxy of fraud.  However later that night [[retards| Boxxy Super-fans]] posted pictures pointing out the matching shoes, chinscar, freckles, and other things [[fact|only those creepy fucks would notice.]] The second auction ended on 11/23/10, but the bag was not paid for.

On 11/30/10 she also [http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rt=nc&nma=true&item=180594832966&si=P1PyhUUzYRHhIkQJfHqpgqvvqx4%253D&viewitem=#ht_500wt_947 listed] her childhood "Sanrio Cinamoroll Backpack", which sold for $1000, and was confirmed paid for, unlike her InuYasha bag, on 12/10/10, via [http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&userid=lwayne9571&ftab=AllFeedback&myworld=true feedback] confirming delivery.

==Boxxy RETURNS FOR REAL==

On 11/25/10, "Catie" posted this video on Unichan, along with pictures to prove legitimacy.

First video is the original, second is with subtitles.

It seems that boxxy needs help to get her channel back. Many brix were shat at this request.

For you dumbshits that don't believe it's her, view the image in full size and compare the scar on her chin and triforce birthmark to the other many pictures of her.
