Agoraphobia
[[Image:Tropicana.jpg|thumb|right|ARRGGGGHHHH!!!!]]

'''Agoraphobia''' is a [[mental disorder]] whose name is derived from the [[Greek]] ''"fear of the [[eBay|marketplace]]"''. This basically means that the [[victim]] of this disorder is afraid of the outdoors and only feels safe when inside his or her mother's basement, playing [[video games]] and reading [[furry]] fan fiction. 

== Epidemiology ==

Agoraphobia is most often self-diagnosed by [[Self-injury|self-injurers]], [[Depression|depressives]], and other [[losers]] as an excuse to stay at home [[masturbating]] to [[guro]]. 

Interestingly, those claiming to suffer from agoraphobia ''do'' manage to turn up at the latest [[furry]], [[anime]] or [[lolicon]] convention without fail. It is estimated that [[99.9%]] of all people who claim to have the sickness are [[lying]] (Ã  la [[fibromyalgia]]).

If you do encounter someone who actually does have agoraphobia, try the following fun things to do with him or her:

* Drop them off in the middle of the woods.
* Burn down their house.
* Kick them in the face until they die.

[[Wikipedia]] [[Wikipedia:Agoraphobia|states that]] agoraphobia is not actually the fear of outdoors but in fact the fear of having a panic attack in a social situation. Sadly, Wikipedia is full of [[shit]].

== Not to Be Confused With ==

*  The fear of people named [[Al Gore]]. Although the man scares the shit out of everyone.
