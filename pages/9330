Zac Goldsmith

I REALISE THIS PAGE WILL GET A DEATH NOTICE, I AM A RETARD AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO WIKI PROPERLY. i.e. I am a fucking retard. '''Please - can someone good at writing shit like this develop this article?''' 

I will create a stub, which I hope a skilled troll can enhance for great lulz. This multimillionaire is said to be very trollable, so will probably be [[butthurt]] if a good version of this article is developed.
