Legacy Computers
[[Image:oldcompy.png|thumb|Typical computer]]
'''Legacy computers''' are anything more than a week old.  It's a nice way of saying, "Hey you computer is shit and I've made this software especially shitty for your computer, enjoy." Legacy computers can't do [[shit]].

==Why They Exist==
[[retards|People]] are such cheap bastards that can't go to [[losers|newegg.com]] and buy a decent computer for around 10,000 dollars. A result of their cheapness is an interest in [[Linux]], which is fast only on slow computers.

==What can I do?==
*Not use Linux
*Purchase the most expensive computer you can find, wait a month, and repeat.
*[[????]]
*[[PROFIT]]

==Classification==
Legacy PCs usually are known as the following:
*[[Mac]]s (common yuppy masturbation device)
*Anything without an Official Windows 9 Certified sticker.
*Less than 32 GB DDR3 ram
*Only 4 cores
*Non-dual-layer-blu-ray-DVD-disk-drives
*Computers with clogged tubes, i.e. [[Google_Chrome#about:internets|Google Chrome]]
*Any computer that dies when you take out the ram while it is running.

** Cheat Code: Trade your used-up, rotten [[Fleshlight]] on [[Craigslist]] for a legacy computer, affix an Official Windows Vista Certified sticker to the chassis, and then sell it on [[Craigslist]] (with a picture including the sticker) for a tidy profit: more than enough to buy a new [[Fleshlight]]!
