Rau
{{crapstub}}
'''Rau''' is a very [[H8|loved]] member of the [[BYOND]] community.
He enjoys [[raping]] the hell out of GMs, only to try and steal their jobs after. (He has succeeded quite a few times.) He is [[H8|loved]] by many, and he gets much [[h8|love]]. His gender is [[transexual|unknown]], he seems to keep changing his mind. For the sake of this article, we will call it a "he". He likes to come on when the owner of the game is online, so he can [[rape|suck up]] as much as he can. More or less likely to do his best to make sure no one steals his [[batshit|self-proclaimed]] [[insane|title]]. [[whore|'''Suck up to the MAX.''']]

== Byond Keys ==
[[Image:RauLOL.PNG|thumb|What Rau wishes he looked like.]]
His recent [[BYOND]] keys are '''Deirun''' & '''Porygon 2'''(He says that's his friends, but he always seems to use it.)
If you happen to see these keys on your [[Byond]] game, Be aware. He will do [[blowjob|anything]] for GM.

We advise you stand clear of him, for your own dignity.

== Hobbies ==

His current hobby is leaving forever. Only to come back the next day. Recent record, few hours. Surprising? I think not. He likes guys AND girls. Yes ladies, he is [[bisexual]]! (Or so he says). He currently has a [[whore|girlfriend]] though, Maybe she doesn't know. I smell a scandal kids.
Custom icons are his drugs. He'll kill for some. Just to look "special".

As if that wasn't enough, you can often find him in the Byond community, [[luring children]] in and [[raping|encouraging]] them to go to [[furry]] [[porn]] sites. Because, of course, he's a [[fuck|fucking]] furry. If you were to wander into his house, (can you say "[[rape]]"?) and somehow find your way into his closet, don't be surprised if you find a few fursuits, cameras, and lube, for this is how furries [[masturbation|get off.]]


He also like poking at his dick with heated implements such as red hot scissors, hot dog pokers, branding irons, and iron dildoes. I want to have sex with him.

==Profession==

Rau is an art teacher for an elementary school.
