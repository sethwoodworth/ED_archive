'''''[[Twat|Twi]]light''''' pronounced [toilet] or '''''Why [[truth|Mormons Shouldn't Write Vampire Fiction]]''''', along with its cash-cow sequels ''[[Emo|New Moon]]'', ''[[Goatse|Eclipse]]'' (''Sparklequeers versus Furfags'') , and ''[[Mantrain|Breaking Dawn]],'' are a [[TL;DR|four novel long]], [[vampire]] [[gay|romance]] Harry Potter fan fiction that appeals to the tiny minds of [[16 year old girls]], [[vampire|vampirefags]], and [[furfags|werewolf story fanbois]]. Plus, the [[Pain Series|book series]] itself represents some of the worst and most [[Epic failure|fucking abysmal]] "[[book|literature]]" ever conceived of in the history of mankind. 

Full of one-dimensional characters and completely devoid of originality, the series is comparable to reading the scribblings and shit stains of an [[epileptic]] [[retard|downie]] coloring while a strobe light is being shone in its face. Avoid reading it at all costs.

The book series is easily the worst thing to hit the werewolf genre since [[furries]], and the worst thing to happen to vampires [[BAWWW|ever]]. The entire series of books and movies, which would have been better as a one season television series on lifetime then forgotten, have no redeeming value to speak of as either literature or cinema, and should be avoided like [[The Black Plague]].

If you want to know just how horrible ''Twilight'' is, it's worse than Tara Gilesbie's masterpiece ''[[My Immortal]]'', because ''My Immortal'' was funny. ''Twilight'' just makes small children cry.  The maddening thing is that ''Twilight'' isn't rotting on fanfiction.net like it should be, but making [[lolwut|shitloads of cash]] which funds its author's [[fat|lard ass]] with twinkies and ho ho's. The author is listed in [http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1733748_1733752_1736282,00.html ''Time Magazine''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 100 Most Influential People] for catering to the fantasies of [[Twitard|16 year old girls]] who wouldn't know a good book if it raped them [[in the ass]]. Twilight also supports [[pedophilia]], [[necrophilia]], [[incest]], [[bestiality]] and [[babyfuck]].

But most importantly, Twilight is a full-proof way for you [[sick fuck|sick fucks]] out there to tap that jail-bait ass you've been stalking for months. Proven to work better than candy and a van with tinted windows, also cheaper than roofies.

==[[Failure|"Plot"]]==

<br>

Lol, what plot? Who doesn't love incest, bestiality, sodomy, homosexuality, necrophilia, and a slight hint of shit fetish all rolled into one?  The books are cooking in the cesspool of the modern monster-drama genre, where instead of [[Rape|raping]] the living shit out of victims and actually doing what made vampires notable in the first place, they [[bullshit|live among humans, go to high school, and shine like a thousand crystals under the sun]]. Scholars debate to this day whether or not these things can rightfully be classified as vampires, rather than a breed of humanoid leech creatures (Given the fact that they shine in sunlight instead of burn and do not turn into bats/have any batlike characteristics, but still suck [[cock|blood]].) However scholars have found out that the reason they shine is that they are constantly soak in their own [[cum]]. The majority of the books consist of drawn-out shit dialogue so bad one might consider it having been [[Period|discharged]] from Meyer's filthy cunt itself. Each chapter plays out its own little [[drama]]-filled [[emo]] [[role-playing]] session, with more than half of each consisting of characters giving [[WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY|wry]] smiles, chuckling, hissing, glaring, and raising eyebrows during vapid and angst ridden [[Diarrhea|logorrhea]]. The stories are written in the first person, from [[Mary Sue|Bella Swan's]] point of view - but since she's an insipid whore, it's easy for the reader to forget. If you dig a hole in middle-class suburbia and throw in a [[16-year-old girl]], a [[redundant|self-loathing, fudge-packing, fairy emo]] [[vampire]] and a date-raping pedophile [[furry|werewolf]], you get the gist of the series. Basically it's a Fap Fest for fat Emo cunts who will never get laid.

Also known as '''[[Dr. Steel|Twilight 2: Electric Boogaloo]]''', and "holy shit, doo you really need more twinkies and ho-hos?". This book will be the same old stupid crap from the first ''Twilight'', only told from Edward's perspective (oh the originality), undeniable proof that Meyer is not only shameless, but also lazy and fat; she gets to recycle all her old dialogue, change a few verbs and nouns and write approximately 2% of a new book. This book plus the following ''Twilight Guide'' and the movie companion version of the book just prove that Stephenie is just [[cow|milking]] these fangirls for all they're worth (and they deserve it for being so stupid to actually like this shit).
[[Image:PMS Petition.png|thumb|Holy fuck nuts, it's just a book, children.]]

'''August 28, 2008:''' ''Midnight Sun'' leaks onto the [[interwebs]]. A [[butthurt]] Stephenie Meyer [http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsun.html writes about how the leak saddens her] on her website. The culprit of the breach isn't some l337 hacker, but in a true showcase of stupidity, Meyer herself. She's been throwing around unfinished drafts like they were confetti, even giving one to the guy who plays Edward in the shitty movie adaption of ''Twilight'' so he could "better understand his character." Which for an actor is pretty insulting, even if Robert Pattinson has the charisma and emotional range of a carboard box. Rpattz most likely leaked the manuscript in retaliation of being stuck playing a character he hates. Someone needs to call the WAAAAHMBULANCE! There is now [http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/savemidnightsun/signatures.html a Publish Midnight Sun (PMS) Petition] full of illiterate [[Aspergers|aspie]] fangirls bawling and begging for ''Midnight Sun'' in caps lock. 

{{quote|<small>With writing, the way you feel changes everything. If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die...</small>|Stephenie Meyer, finally having a good idea.}}

[[Image:Stephaniemeyer.jpg|thumb|[[Lie|OMG STEPHANIE MEYER TTLY ISN'T BELLA SWAN!1!1!!.]]]]

<big>'''Bella'''</big>

Completely unlikable in every sense of the word. Seriously, even most Twifags hate her. Bell is the dullest, whiniest, and most weak-willed [[bitch]] of a main [[Mary Sue|character]] you'll ever find <strike>outside of online fanfiction</strike>. If the name didn't give it away already, she's nothing but a self-insertion for the author, Stephenie. The name "Bella" is actually Italian for "beautiful", so her name actually means [[Cunt|"beautiful swan"]]. Like oh-so-many protagonists for romance novels, she's the "[[Bitch|average, ordinary, everyday girl]]" archetype, and constantly gets into life-endangering situations from which she [[loser|cannot herself escape]], thus becoming a [[raped|damsel in distress]]. In an attempt to make Bella's relationship with Edward normal, Meyer makes Bella unable to live without her 'hawt' boyfriend, thus the plot for New Moon. Not only does Bella obsess over her perfect, no-personality boyfriend, but all she wants from him is sex,sex and MOAR SEX. Four 500 page books full of shit just so Bella can have sex with her god-like possessive, abusive, emo boyfriend. In an attempt to not make her absolutely perfect, the author gave her a fault of being really, ridiculously [[moron|clumsy]], which the [[Mary Sue]] article will tell you is not an actual fault. If you have any doubt about Bella being a Sue, just read [http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight_faq.html#bella this description of Bella] from Meyer herself, which goes so far as to describe the shape of her mouth and once again testifies to her [[fail]].

</div>

<div class="SECTION2">

[[Image:TwilightFangirl.jpg|thumb|Every Edward fangirl, ever.]]

<big>'''Edward'''</big>

The vampire of Bella's affection, he is [[at least 100|at least a hundred]] years old and is a ''[[wut|vegetarian vampire]]'' and a [[pretty cool guy]] since he abstains from eating humans, but pet owners watch out! He could be eating your cat/dog  as you are reading this! There is no moment when he isn't in complete control of [[whore|Bella]]. When it comes to her, he is unyielding and possessive and not hesitant to have a [[rape|bite]] of anyone else who considers doing her, including Jacob Black. What [[fat whore|fans of ''Twilight'']] seemingly [[fail]] to realize is that such qualities (overbearing possessiveness, watching Bella while she sleeps and so on) are more often found in [[pedopals|sex offenders]] than [[tron guy|the perfect man]]. Such things can apparently be ignored/forgiven when love is supposedly involved. Edward can also read [[lolwut|people's minds]], a skill he frequently uses to cheat on game shows. However, he [[fail|can't read Bella's mind]], because she is [[Retard|special and unique]] like a pretty [[whore|snowflake]]. He also sparkles like a faggot in teh sunlight, OMG! What people don't know about him is that he is Dracula's reject, unwanted faggity ass son.

[[File:392937 - Jacob Black Twilight.jpg|thumb|[[guro|What Jacob does in his spare time.]]]]

[[Image:Jacob is a pedo twilight.jpg|thumb|Jacob imprints baby Nessie. [[Babyfuck|IT'S AWWW-RIGHTTT!]]]]

<big>'''Jacob'''</big>

A <s>[[Native American]]</s> REDSKIN PRARIE-NIGGER INJUN, werewolf, [[pedophile]] and angst-ridden [[teenager]] with [[virgin|a massive sex drive]], self-proclaimed [[lie|mechanic]] and local furry. Jacob is also an obsessive stalker and [[fanboy]] over Bella, and [[faps]] to her with his tiny native cock [[over 9,000]] times a day while crying hysterically about the evils of the [[White people|White Man]]. His [[Rape|lust]] for Bella conflicting with Edward's equally-powerful horniness for her causes Twilight <s>fans</s> [[fags]] to engage in senseless [[NO U|wars]] with each other, leading to mass internet bloodshed and many gay [[emo|emo tears]]. One half of the fan-base raves, complete with the Hellish screeches of [[acne]]-infested [[fangirls]], that [[Unrealistic expectations|Bella is going to marry Jacob]]; the other half believes [[Seriously|Bella is going to marry Edward]]. But don't get this confused with [http://www.amazon.com/Vampire-Werewolf-books-touch-romance/lm/R1GGUVCOOG6UTR all the other totally original vampire/werewolf romance novels.] Also, Jacob Black (as well as all the other <s>natives</s> squaws, who are also all werewolves – [[Racism|as is pertinent to their savage nature]]) is a little less perfect than the other [[Flaccid|flat]] characters in this festering shit pile of a "book". Some intelligent people not obsessed with Edward's [[Sparkling wiggles|sparkly]] disco [[balls]] or Jacob's [[pedobear|furry, pedo balls]] say that this is because Meyer is a [[Batshit insane|Mormon]] (as well as a moron), and thus racist. In the fourth book, Jacob falls in love with Bella's newborn mutant spawn of a daughter. [[lie|But its ok cause he doesn't think of her sexually yet]]. Obviously, Smeyer [[Mormon|has no morals]], as Edward was already a pedo, and Jacob becomes one as well.
</div>

<div class="SECTION4">
<big>'''Nessie'''</big>

[[File:Harlequininsane.jpg|thumb|Nessie Cullen.]]

"Nessie" Cullen is Bella and Edward's mutant hybrid spawn-of-Satan kid. It was nicknamed after the Loch Ness Monster, Bella's true love interest. Its full name is Renesmee Carlie Cullen and for entirely obvious and pertinent reasons that are [[lie|relevant to the storyline]], it has an extra chromosomal pair, making it a [[lolwut|half-human, half vampire]] as well. Many [[lulz]] are had at this, as anyone with even the most rudimentary understanding of biology knows that [[Hurr|an extra chromosomal pair results in Down's Syndrome, not hybrids.]] According to the author of this shit storm, [[Faggot|vampire]] + [[Mary_sue|human]] = hybrids (see ''The Munsters'') because [[Fuckin' Magnets|FUCK YOU SCIENCE]].

Besides being really cute and having lots of pretty white teeth, Nessie also has the joy of growing super-fast; which is ironic since vampires aren't supposed to age, so [[Epic fail|it proves the author doesn't even know her own subject of writing]]. Its soon-to-be-husband Jacob Black only has to wait seven years to [[pedophile|commence the fucking]]. 

Her name is pronounced "Ren-smee" (or "smeg-ma"), despite what legions of twitards would otherwise tell you.

<div class="SECTION5">

[[Image:EdwardIRL.PNG|thumb|[[Brian Peppers|Edward Peppers]]]]

[[Image:Twilightshoopdawhoop.jpg|thumb|The true faces of the Cullens.]]

<big>'''[[Douche|Alice Cullen]]'''</big>

Alice Cullen is Edward's [[slut|perky]] [[incest|step-sister]] who has the nifty ability to [[cheat|predict the future]], which, like Edward, allows her to cheat on game shows. She very much enjoys throwing parties like her long lost brother Corey Delaney. She is said to resemble [[Imma Let You Finish|Taylor Swift]], Rachel Leigh Cook, and [[whore|Amy Winehouse]]. Along with moving like a gazelle and routinely dancing across the cafeteria - literally - Alice is said to rival even the toughest of the tough. [[Fangirls]] like to think that she, along with her God-like step-brother Edward, can and will kill [[Chuck Norris]]. This is the biggest example of a [[lie]] in the history of mankind, even more untrue than the [[cake]].

----
<big>'''[[Redneck|Jasper Hale]]'''</big>

Jasper is a HALE. His most notable feature for the first 2 books is that he is apparently the love of Alice's life. Like Edward and Alice he has some sort of power but it's pretty crappy compared to the other two. Amazingly he is the most [[emo]] of the family (more than Edward) because in his dark past he acted like a real vampire and actually killed people. He also has a very big [[penis]] and loves to sing some songs about the confederacy. As a [[white people|southerner at heart]], Jasper is known for participating in acts of [[incest]] with his brothers and sisters in his past lives, and, naturally, in this life.  
----
<big>'''[[Bitch|Rosalie Hale]]'''</big>

Rosalie HALE is a spoiled slutty blond whore whose family was apparently [[lolwut|very well off during the Great Depression because her dad owned a bank]]. They were able to maintain their well being of course by stealing money from the bank accounts of their clients like a bunch of [[Jews]]. She only became a vampire after getting raped by her "soon to be" husband, [[Win|only for her to murder him Kill-Bill style after.]] Of course, this only moment of awesome in this pile of fail is never expanded on and only mentioned in passing, because that would actually make the story interesting and make Rosalie a [[pretty cool guy]]. An we can't have someone better or more interesting that our precious Bella, [[amirite]]? So because she is blonde, and doesn't like Bella, she is a flat character that [[no one cares]] about and is jealous of Bella-Sue.
----
<big>'''[[No one likes you|Emmett Cullen]]'''</big>

Emmett Cullen is often described in the book like a bear. He is in fact the son of a naturalist who, after [[fail|accidentally]] giving himself a mild tranquilizer while attempting to [[date rape|knock out a bear]], wound up having [[epic fail|unprotected sex]] with said bear. If you can't do the math, this makes Emmett a [[furfag|half breed]]. 
----
<big>'''Carlisle Cullen'''</big>

Carlisle Cullen is the local and only doctor because Forks is too much of a hick town to afford more than one. When he first became a vampire he hid away in the  London sewers and was a shut-in (mind you it was 300 years before TV was invented.) He then went and spent all his time with the goody goody gay Volturi who kicked him out because he wasn't enough of a real vampire for them.  Since he has no actual cool powers of his own he made other vampires to protect him even though half of them were [[fail|powerless]].
----
<big>'''Esme Cullen'''</big>

Esme Cullen has no reason to exist. She is only there because Carlisle apparently needed someone to fuck on his own time since you're an OMG DORK if you don't have anyone to be with. Spends the majority of the time telling Bella "[[awwright|it's going to be okay]]" and looking concerned.  
----
<big>'''[[Guido|The Volturi]]'''</big>

The Volturi are composed of three [[gay]] men and are [[Unrealistic Expectations|highly regarded]] as [[Vapid twat|vampire royalty]] despite the obvious fact that they do nothing but [[buttsecks|hump each other day in, day out]] and huff [[jenkem]]. They also enjoy hunting other vampires and have also been reported to be [[OM NOM NOM NOM|serial cannibals]], even deadlier than Hannibal Lecter as well as that they think that humans, particularly babies, make tasty snacks. The Volturi are also known to frequent gay bars in their spare time and fantasize about [[rape|raping]] other vampires such as Edward Cullen and [[what|Lestat de Lioncourt]].

==The Author==

[[Image:Meyer is a fatty.jpg|thumb|What [[My Chemical Romance]] is to [[Goth|The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Fat|Stephenie Meyer]] is to [[Anne Rice]].]]

[[Mormon|Stephenie Meyer]] graduated from [http://www.byu.edu/webapp/home/index.jsp Brigham Young University] with a Bachelors Degree in [[fail|English]], receiving the best education you can get from a school which gives the Eucharist and the alcohol-free blood of Christ in the cafeteria (note the links at the bottom of the college's front page to [[Mormon|The Church of Latter Day Saints]] and the [[Scientology|Missionary Training Center]]). Looking at her writing abilities, she probably just bullshat her way through every class ever. Instead of teaching kids about compound sentences and verbs, she decided to write a book. Why write in first person? It's because the entire series is actually a wet dream that the author had. [[Mary Sue|She wishes she could be Bella]], and decided that she could profit from the wet dream. The idea for ''Twilight'' came in a wet dream she had about a [[Sparkling Wiggles|sparkling vampire]] in a meadow blabbering on about how hesitant he is to love a mortal. Three months later, ''Twilight'' was written and on its way to super stardom. 

{{quote|<small>All I can guess is that when I write, I forget that it's not real.</small>|Stephenie, on her wet dreams.}}

After being hailed as [[lie|the next J. K. Rowling by ''Time Magazine'']], Stephenie suffers from a severe case of [[unwarranted self-importance]]. Meyer goes so far as to actually brag about how easy it was for her to become an immediate success with all the little [[12 year old girls]] and stupid fucks out there buying her shit. A side note: all of Meyer's photos [[internet disease|try to hide]] how overweight she actually is. Maybe if she spent some time jazzercising and less time writing vampire fanfiction, her husband would actually touch her and she wouldn't have to dream about Edward's sparkly cock. Her husband probably just [[Orgy|fucks the other two wives]] he's married to and [[Slavery|Meyer is just there to make money]].

It should also be noted that Meyer's taste in music is complete [[shit]], as explained by the fact that she said [[Linkin Park|Linkin Park]] and [[MCR|My Chemical Romance]] were [[emo|inspirations for her as she wrote the series (some shit about 3 Days Grace too).]] ([http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20308569_20308554_5,00.html Here] and [http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20308569_20308554_7,00.html here,] respectively). This explains why so much of the books is spent with the characters [[angst|angsting]] about [[shit_no_one_cares_about|trivial stuff]], and proves once and for all that if you read Twilight, you are an [[emo]].

She is possibly the most retarded Mormon ever, as evidenced by the [[faggot|main character]] not having [[at least 100]] wives.

To further pour salt on the wounds of ''Twilight'' fangirls unable to accept the fact that their beloved series is the literary equivalent of a four-year-old's crayon scribblings, aging hack Stephen King came out in early 2009 and expressed his distaste for the series' author:

{{quote|...Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a [[censorship|darn]]. She's not very good."|Stephen King, [http://blogs.usaweekend.com/whos_news/2009/02/exclusive-steph.html telling it like it is]: ''U.S. Weekend'' magazine, late January 2009.}}


{{quote|<small>I wrote the book for myself.</small>|Stephenie responding, apparently forgetful of the fact that she published the book.}}

{{quote|<small>Stick to doing what you know... like eating publishers cocks.</small>|Stephen King's final response }}


Naturally, being averse to all forms of logic, truth, and good taste, this statement enraged the armies of Twilight fans around the internet, creating all sorts of [[lulz|delicious drama and fangirl tears.]]

On March 6th, in response to the [[lulz|internet shitstorm]] made by the [[trolling|interview with Stephen King]], USA Weekend started a poll to find out which of three authors (King, [[Harry Potter|J.K. Rowling]] and Meyer) truly had the biggest [[spam]] power. [http://blogs.usaweekend.com/whos_news/2009/03/best-writer-pol.html Here's the poll.] As of August, King held [[over_9000|70% of the vote]] as the best of a bad bunch and Rowling held about 25%, leaving [[unwarranted self importance|Stephenie Meyer the greatest and newest thing since lighting a fart]] in the dust, with [[fail|about 5%]]. [[Some argue]] that this just might be because King (and comparatively Rowling) are halfway decent writers while Meyer is a blathering dipshit whose entire literative output consists of elaborations on her fat, sexually frustrated Mormon fantasies.

==Controversies==
[[Image:Averagetwilightfan.jpg|thumb|Tina Fey was cool until Twilight fucked her up]]
=== Alleged Sexism ===

Stephenie Meyer, the series' author, has been [[bawwwww|criticized]] for her portrayal of a [[truth|weak, helpless female]] lead who falls madly in love with a man who wants to kill her. Being that she's a [[Moron|Mormon]], we can all see where she gets these ideals from. Others disagree and claim that the relationship has fair precedent, citing the common practice of marriages to incarcerated serial killers and the notorious original ending to the movie Terminator. This idea has been backed up by legions of the books' fans, prompting others of the female persuasion to attempt to forcibly remove their extra X chromosome.

=== Robert Pattinson ===

Unaware of the popularity of the book series or the insanity of its fanbase, the young actor signed on to play Edward Cullen in a three-movie contract deal in order to hit on to the lead actress. When he found out his mistake, Pattinson took to insulting the book and its author in interviews and appearing in public after long periods of not showering in order to avoid his fans. Of course, this didn't work. There is widespread speculation as to what Pattinson will try next, including possibly [[Shay|gaining 200 pounds and smearing his face with human excrement]]. We assume that Pattinson's agents are currently negotiating a deviation from the book in the third movie, in which Edward Cullen is unexpectedly killed by Lord Voldemort.

''Twilight'' somehow proved popular enough that a bunch of people made it into a film, which, to the disappointment of many, does not star or feature [http://www.gala.fr/var/gal/storage/images/les_stars/leurs_bio/ulliel_gaspard/images/gaspard_ulliel/188401-1-fre-FR/gaspard_ulliel_reference.jpg this guy] as Edward. In this abomination of mankind, Rob Pattinson who signed a contract  to play Edward fucking Cullen, the book-famous attention man-whore. Fangirls all over the world are bitching and whining about how he isn't in the movie, but we all know that when it comes out they'll go see it anyway and have multiple orgasms when RPattz comes onto the screen, giving extreme [[lulz]] or eyeburning to the people who will see the videos of said orgasms on [[YouTube]] for weeks to [[cum|come]]. 

Fucking things up like always, the [[Americans]] had to get the cheapest surefire hunk on the market to wet the panties of its fanbase, particularly one who has already established his name with the tweeny market (starring in things with Daniel Radcliffe).

As he was killed off during the final scenes of ''The Goblet of Fire'', Cedric Diggory aka RPattz was looking for anything he could get to tide him over until he got the cheque for the Dali movie. Poor guy didn't know what he was getting himself into until it was too late and he was signed up for three movies. Send him fan letters with ideas on how to get fired because [http://vids.eonline.com/services/link/bcpid1396519019/bctid1915367691 try] [http://www.eonline.com/videos/v36324_Pattinson_Preps_for__Twilight__Takeover.html as] [http://i222.photobucket.com/albums/dd147/Tyriku/twilight2.jpg he] [http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0613685/ might] it just hasn't happened yet. He might pass your tips on to Kristen Stewart aka Bella, who [http://www.popcrunch.com/kristen-stewart-smoking-marijuana-photos/ also wants out].

Utilizing the skills of [[loser|Catherine Hardwicke]], the movie was the biggest piece of shit to hit the screens since ''The Love Guru'', but due to its high numbers of fangirls a sequel was greenlit. ''New Moon'', where NOTHING HAPPENS, is now a movie too.

In a particularly [[lulzy]] development, both of the [http://filmdrunk.uproxx.com/?p=6134 lead] [http://filmdrunk.uproxx.com/?p=6077 actors] have come forward to admit the author and fans are essentially [[batshit]]:

{{quote|<small>It was like reading her sexual fantasy, especially when she said it was based on a dream and it was like, ‘Oh I’ve had this dream about this really sexy guy,’ and she just writes this book about it. Like some things about Edward are so specific, I was just convinced, like, ‘This woman is mad. She’s completely mad and she’s in love with her own fictional creation.’ And sometimes you would feel uncomfortable reading this thing.

===Death===

Wow! As if we needed further proof that Twilight is bad for your health, a 23 year old New Zealand "man" died while going to see the third movie in the Twitard sobbuh. It is not yet known whether he was on a deliberate quest to become an hero, but oh the lulz they are delicious.

==Conclusion==

As you are probably well aware, [[Fact|Twilight is shit]]. You may have even read the book [[hipster|ironically]] and written about how terrible it is on your [[blog]] because [[attention whore|you're totally original like that]]. Congratulations, have a cookie. <s>But inevitably, despite the atrocity to literature that is Twilight, it has still sold [[over 9000|over 100 million]] copies which makes it [[fact|statistically]] better than anything [[you]] will EVER write down.</s> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS.]] [[Truth|Twilight is shit and you could draw a picture of a fat fuck jizzing on the face of a goth, and it would still be more artistic, better-written, deeper and just superior to Twilight.]]

Of course, [[faggot|we]] all know [[Noone|who the real winner]] is here don't we?

Side note, real men watch Daybreakers, a [[Shit|shit]] film about, you know, vampires and stuff. Notable for the fact that nothing happens in the first hour of screen time, closely followed by a half-hour segment comprised almost entirely from artistic shots of [[Quentin Tarantino|fake intestines]]. Also notable for the fact that the vampires [[Awesome|fucking explode]] when killed, and that the only hot girl in the entire film becomes an [[emo]] [[vampire]] gargoyle and becomes [[An Hero]] through [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|self-immolation]]. Side side note, I am not referring to the [[loli]] at the start. Why would you even think that, you [[sick fuck]]?
