'''Mstaken.com''' is a website and blog which sells and promotes their "anti-douchebag" product: the '''Ms. Taken Ring'''. The basic concept behind this ($25 piece-of-shit) ring is that women can wear it and it will provide them with a shield against assholes in bars and clubs who attempt to pick them up. We all know however, that [[rape|a ring is no defense for a woman cornered]]. A better solution might be a <del>[[Sonichu]] medallion</del> (that's '''women repellent''').  An even better solution would be ''learning how to talk to people and deal with (potentially uncomfortable) social situations like a fucking adult''.

The site owners also upload [what we think they consider] "humorous" videos to their [[YouTube]] account, but in actual fact that are just cheap, unfunny rip-offs of already existing videos. Their [[blog]] is... well, lackluster at most.

{{quote|Who says being engaged is all that? The biggest upside is being left alone, once people spot a ring on your left hand. Whether you're trying to dodge dodgy dudes at the bar, heading to a reunion or visiting your nagging grandmother, slip on your Ms.Taken ring and act as if. It says committed, without the commitment. | mstaken.com|because being single or slutty is a bad thing?}}

==One ring to fend them all...==

==Possible Backfire(?)==
If you wear this ring and are still single at 40, you may need to reevaluate your [[Bitch|approach to men]].  But don't worry.  Even if the ring may have repelled many decent guys away from you over the years and blew your chances for ''finding true love'', there's always [[Final Solution|a way out]].  And it's free!
