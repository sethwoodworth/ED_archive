Quiverfull

"Quiverfull" refers to a movement of [[Fundamentalist]] [[Christian]] [[fucktards]] who are trying to take over the world by having families of [[at least 100]] children the [[sex|old-fashioned way]].  The ultimate [[breeder]] ideology. (Compare [[Lesbian|Childfree]].) 

== History == 
In the glory days that were 1980's [[America]], Fundamentalist Christians who had gathered together for their [[convention]] noticed that only like five [[people]] had shown up, presumably because everyone else had stayed home playing [[Atari]], because, well, it was the 1980's, and that's what people did back then, [[fgt]].  Realizing that it was necessary to repopulate their depleted numbers (and because they were trying to raise enough [[money]] for [[pr0n]] and [[beer]]), the group began to consider possibilities.  Proposals included:

1.  Preaching their message to other, like-minded denominations. 

2.  Preaching to local minority communities.  (Since Fundamentalists are all members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], this proposal was immediately dismissed.)

3.  Preaching to the poor, the homeless, the destitute. (See reason for dismissal of proposal #2)  

4.  Preaching to [[Arabs]].  

5.  Going home and sticking their [[cocks]] into their wives' [[cunts]] and filling them with their [[cum|white, frothy man goo]] until they had entire armies of super [[inbred]] [[Nazi|Aryan]] robot zombie children with names like "Hester," "[[Oral]]," and "Calvin."  And (here's the [[shocker]]) getting their wives to ''believe'' they want to be walking brat factories.

== Theology ==

Quiverfull theology is based on verses from Psalm 127:3-5 (in the [[Bible]] duh):

''Lo, chidrens are [[An hero|an heritage]] of the [[God|LORD]]:''

''and the [[fruit]] of the [[dead_babies|womb is his reward]].''

''As arrows are in the [[cock|hand]] of a mighty [[the_man|man]];''

''so are chidrens of the [[13_year_old|youth]].''

''Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them:''

''they shall not be ashamed,''

''but they shall speak with the [[Osama|enemies]] in the gate.''

Note from a Jew: This Psalm was just King David dreaming about buttsecks with little boys.  Christians do it wrong.

== On the Internets ==

Since male adherents of Quiverfull ideology are mostly illiterate, knuckle-dragging [[morons]], most Quiverfull blogs on [[teh]] [[Internets]] are written by [[women]] who spend most of their time bragging about:

#How many children they have (fewer than 15 is considered shameful), 
#How pretty the cover of their home organization binders are,
#Thanking [[Jesus]] for giving them husbands who treat them like [[slaves]] 
#Mocking "those poor women who don't know Jesus" (i.e., [[feminists]] and wives who haven't submitted to their husbands' repeated requests for [[anal]]).
#[[????|????????]]
#[[Profit|PROPHET!11!]]

(this shit isn't that hard you faggots.)

== Rankings ==

Quiverfull mothers rank themselves according to the number of children they have:

*1-15:  "im just a [[n00b]] LOL"
*16-[[over 9000]]:  "[[1337]]"
