'''Samuel Hengel''' was a crusader for [[justice|graet justice]] who, carrying some serious fucking heat, burst into his school and:

{{quote|He fired shots into a wall, desk and projector equipment in the room, [[Troll's Remorse|but never aimed at students]].|}}

[[Dramacrat|Experts]] believe that his boring [[Wisconsin]] life played a role in his decision to commit such a [[mundane]] crime.  Whatever the case, this young man's balls dropped in record time, and in about 3 hours he went from intrepid nerd to [[California|Ahnold]] status. 
==The Plot==
===Act 1 - Birth of An Hero=== 
*Like oh-so-many malnourished and [[List of banned users|socially inept]] samples of trailer trash, Samuel was presumably the [[lolcow|victim of bullying]], and decided to remedy the situation [[old meme|in a new and inventive way]]: <s>bringing a gun to school</s> bringing [[O rly|''MULTIPLE'']] guns to school. According to [http://abcnews.go.com/US/wisconsin-hostage-standoff-gunman-shoots/story?id=12272586 newz], Sam brought both a classic [[Gun|9 MM pistol]], and a [[serious fucking business|.22 Cal Semi-Automatic]].

===[[female|Unlikely]] Protagonist===
*After unleashing his fury on the classroom's movie projector and several unfortunate [[chair|desks]], he demanded that the students hand over their cellphones, apparently to prevent police contact; also hoping that nobody would discover something was wrong in a room that is supposed to [[retard|fill with new students every 45 minutes]]. Samuel didn't seem intent on harming the children, as they kept him [[loli|entertained]] with anecdotes and remembrances of times good and bad - although when it seemed like he was '''really''' about to flip the fuck out, many students credit their teacher with saving lives.  <font size=5>'''→''' </font>
===Act 2 - With Great Power... Comes Great Ineptitude===
*Having the fear dispersed by a [[oxymoron|strong, rational woman]] sent young Samuel's [[mindfuck|mind]] down a spiral of torment. He was stupid enough to [http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2010/11/30/chief-wis-teens-gunshot-potentially-life-threatening/ let some kids go] "to the bathroom", and consequently police realized he was a [[vagoo|pussy]], and charged the room. Samuel shot 3 more bullets ([[idiot|still not harming anyone]]), then turned the gun on himself.

*Having reached the end of his rope, [[NO U|unwilling to negotiate]] with cops or even [[the lulz|admit why he did it]], Sam put a bullet in his [undisclosed body part]. A smart man's money says he tried to blow his brains out, but as of yet, no news source will admit it, probably for [[vanity|vanity's]] sake. 

===IT LIVES!===
*Samuel did not succumb to his injuries on the scene; instead of going out in a poetic, emotional blaze of glory, [[death|the Grim Reaper]] opted to let him wallow in a [[tubgirl|pool of his own waste]] in a hospital bed for a good few hours. The stench was great.

==Remembering Samuel==
Look at that sweet, sweet boy. An true hero. Of course, what sets An hero apart from a good old-fashioned [[suicide|self-pwn]] is how fondly the potential hero is remembered.

Nobody outside of [[cheese|Wisconsin]] will ever remember him as anything more than a weak-minded psychopath, but his friends and family will always feel blessed for having known him, which is [[ironic]] considering [[probably|the parents are the ones at fault]]. They can take solace knowing that since Samuel never [[parents|specified a reason]], next Thanksgiving won't be ♫AAAAWKWAAARD.♪... Scratch that. It might be awkward if the [[fudgepacker|Packers]] have a bad year, or else Wisconsin won't have any other news to report on until next Thanksgiving. That being said, the rest of the world was ready to move on almost immediately.

This was the general consensus throughout the land - Samuel wasn't crazy enough to warrant any kind of national reaction, [[Disappoint|and he didn't take anyone with him]] - although notably, low-income territories in Wisconsin now have a law limiting gun ownership to 4-per-household. Samuel also became an [[penis|organ]] [[cum|donor]] - having potentially saved the lives of five children (that number is expected to grow) with his organs... [[OH SHI-|at least, for now]]. In all likelihood they will catch the [[Rabies|brain AIDS]] that fucked up Samuel's wiring, and [[fact|will all become An Heroes themselves]].
