Blue box
[[Image:Blue_box.jpg|thumb|A typical '''Blue box''']]

[[At least 100 years ago]], [[Bell]] thought it could cut costs if it sent out a [[2600]]hz signal through the phone lines right after someone dialed a long distance call. It would have worked, too, if it weren't for those darned kids and their cereal. [[Captain Crunch]] discovered that a toy whistle in a cereal box issued that same sound -- and if you blew on it right after you made a phone call, you got free long distance.  You could also hack into the [[internets]] with it.  Thus, [[phreak]]ing was born.

Soon, [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Woz]] got in the act, and made so much money off the blue box that they used the proceeds to start [[Apple]].  The rest, as they say, is history.  This is just more anecdotal evidence that the more you stick it to [[The Man]], the more the world will become a better place.
