'''[[Wikipedia:User:Eloquence|Erik Möller]]''' is the Deputy Director of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], the parent organization behind [[Wikipedia]], [http://intelligentdesigns.net/blog/?p=86 tireless defender] of [[Jimbo]], and long-time player of "[[Secks|Hide der Sausage]] in [[Angela]]."[http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/hivemind.html#249] Ironically, he also personifies the Wikipedia's "[[web 2.0|cult of the amateur]]" as someone arrogant enough to insert his own bizarre personal views into [[article]]s and get away with it due to his position in the [[cabal|hierarchy]]. His equally fucked-up enemies have recently put the brakes on this by uncovering and publicizing his unhealthy opinions.

Although Wikipedia bows to [[NPOV]], Erik's views on child abuse, [[Lolita|child sexuality]], and [[pedophilia]] are nowhere near neutral, let alone normal. While enlightening [[the child in Africa]] about [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Child_sexuality&diff=prev&oldid=1434539 child sexuality], he also conveniently included such gems as "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_sexual_behavior&diff=prev&oldid=1073774 it is generally acknowledged that children are capable of feeling sexual pleasure, even if they are not yet able to engage in sexual intercourse with each other, and/or are not yet biologically able to reproduce.]"

Erik has left a long trail across the Internet of his status as a fellow traveler to pedophiles and as a freedom fighter against the tyranny of Age of Consent laws. The [http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&rls=en&q=Kinderspiele%20oder%20Kindesmi%C3%9Fbrauch%3F%20Das%20Foto%20aus%20Amendts%20%22Sex%20Buch%22%20ist%20zwanzig%20Jahre%20alt&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi Google Cache] of child pornography from [http://www.humanist.de/erik/taz/ex.html his website] only expired [[last Thursday]], no doubt after several frantic emails. In 2001, he wrote an essay on [[Kuro5hin]] called [http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2001/3/30/4410/84525/72#72 Defending the Right to Pleasure] elucidating his mainstream views: 

{{squote|What is my position on pedophilia, then? It's really simple. If the child [[Asking for it|doesn't want it]], is neutral or ambiguous, it's inappropriate. This excludes most adult/child sexual contact...|Erik Möller}} 

Unfortunately, some of Erik's most [http://pl.atyp.us/wordpress/?p=133 controversial brilliance] is no longer available online, perhaps the last round of [http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/05/page/2/ public outcry] was getting a bit too close for comfort?

Coming on the heels of the [[Carolyn Doran]] debacle, where a simple background check would have have revealed that Wikimedia's COO was in fact a convicted felon, it is unsurprising to see that the Foundation never even bothered to [[Google]] Erik but you might wonder if they ever worried about his constant [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pedosmile pedosmile].
