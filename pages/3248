Gather
[[Image:Gather_fart.jpg|thumb|A classy site for highbrow public radio listeners.]]
According to [http://john.gather.com this scary looking Christian Republican programmer], "gather is the google of web 2.0!" (he says it [http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976768257 somewhere in here], but due to his [[shit]] code, there seems to be no way of linking to the individual comment). Anyway, if he is right, then web 2.0 is a pretty crappy place. No surprise there. The comparison may be a bit exaggerated, however.[http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?compare_sites=google.com&range=6m&size=medium&y=r&url=gather.com]

What gather actually is is a miserably awful [[blog]]ging site that's [[TL;DR|somehow or other]] connected to public radio. (One of the questions they ask when you register is how often you listen.) So, you might think, the people there must be a bunch of pretentious [[old]] [[hippies]] and [[shit nobody cares about|political know-it-alls]], but at least they're probably kind of [[classy]] and halfway literate and stuff. Well, [http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976775774 you'd be right about the first part].

[[Image:Gather_borked.jpg|thumb|Result of the "update." Oops, it is [[b0rk]]ed. Smooth move, scary looking Christian Republican programmer.]]
The [[software]]z running the site [[fellatio|sucks]] [[Quasidan's penis|in a big way]]. There is no threading, just "articles" following by a long string of "comments," so complex [[flame war]]s are very difficult to follow. There's practically no way to customize anything, linking is difficult (see above), and searching doesn't work well. The [[user]]s are all excited about what they call "the update" (apparently they mean "upgrade"), but the main effect of that seems to have been that now every comment is surrounded by an orange speech balloon (or is supposed to be: see [[screencap|screenshot]].

Everyone there is very concerned with gaining "gather points" &mdash; whoever has the most [[a winner is you|wins something]] (the right to have their articles posted somewhere where people might actually see them, I think). [[Noone]] knows exactly how [[teh]] super-sekrit gather point formula works, but they are all sure it has something to do with how many comments your articles get. This causes a dilemma for [[flame]]rs: [[oh noes]], [[you]]r nasty comment will give points to your hated enemy!!!!1! Needless to say, a fine source of [http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976764438 drama].

There is also a rating system (this is different from "gather
points"). [http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976768348 Here] is an article that was rated
10/10. [http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976764750 This] [[fucktard]] who thinks she is an "empath" got 9.2/10 and 60
comments, nearly all along the lines of, "Yes, I know what you're
going through, I've known I was an empath for many years." Basically,
in a nutshell, if this site represents the NPR audience, [[United States|all of us]] are [[in the ass|in big trouble]].
