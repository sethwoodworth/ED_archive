[[Image:Limecrimeongoogle.jpg|thumb|left|Lime Crime according to Google.]][[Image:Doedeereliar.jpg|thumb|Would this face lie to you?]][[Image:Limecrimeliars.jpg|thumb|lol ripoff]]'''[http://www.doedeereblogazine.com Doe Deere]''' (aka Dough, Doh, Xenis, [[sockpuppets|bustyblondeangel, prettypuppy48, princessmoth, barb1efrommars, sushibabies4,]] Thunderwear, Lime Crime, and Xenia) is a [[Russia|Russian]] mail order bride suffering from [[inconsistent personality disorder]] who moved to the [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|US]] in 1999 to marry the [http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y239/limecrime/outfits/alicecooper.jpg oldest looking 25 year old ever] and to make a name for herself in the [[lolcow]] industry. 

As a fashion school dropout who went on to become a failed fashion designer and a failed musician (twice), the self-proclaimed "[[Unwarranted_Self-Importance|Queen of Unicorns]]" is well on her way to becoming [[celebrity|world famous]] and having her face plastered upon every surface in existence (at least she [[Narcissism|likes to think so]]). Most recently, Dough has [http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/my-rainbow invented bright colors] and begun selling <s>original and innovative</s> [[truth|repackaged cosmetics]].

Dough currently has [[over 9000]] sockpuppets and [[You_have_no_friends|two friends]] who assist her and her husband in her attempts to scour the internets and [[delete fucking everything|delete]] anything factual written about her company.

==From Humble Origins==
===Early Scams===
[[Image:Xenishorriblefashionshow.jpg|thumb|left|Dough's shitty Lime Crime fashion show, 2004.]]Like many [[Internet_celebrity|Internet Celebretards]], Dough originally got her start as a [[weeaboo]] known as Thunderwear. In 2004, she changed her brand's name to Lime Crime and would scam people by selling crap [[loli]] dresses on [[eBay]] that she would hem with [http://community.livejournal.com/meanestbastard/76936.html duct] [http://lillianfunnyface.blogspot.com/2009/10/lime-crime-makeup-dilemma.html tape] because she was too lazy to ask her mom to sew shit for her. It was around this time that her obsession with fellow fashion designer [http://www.etsy.com/shop/shrinkle Shrinkle] began, as Dough's designs were basically just [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Doughshittyclothes.jpg shitty rip-offs] of hers. After their friendship ended, Dough started a new business in 2006 selling rip-offs of her new friend [http://www.etsy.com/shop/supayana Supayana's] designs under the name "A Little Country For An Urban Girl."

After realizing nobody was interested in the unfinished home-ec projects of a ginger weeaboo skank, she instead started a [http://community.livejournal.com/meanestbastard/80110.html#comments fake raffle for an animal shelter] to make money and got all [[butthurt]] when people asked her which shelter they were supposedly donating to before giving the name of a shelter that doesn't actually exist. Soon after, Dough started another [http://community.livejournal.com/littlebiggirls/2793379.html raffle], this time claiming to donate the proceeds to the Canadian Pet Rescue. [http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/4673/xeniascam.png Suspicions were raised] and Paypal was contacted, who shut down Dough's account after no evidence of her charity drive was found.

When she wasn't busy scamming people, Dough spent her time trolling livejournal under her numerous sockpuppet accounts while claiming that she was busy living an [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/c/c5/Xeniasushibabies.png "enviable"] and [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/d/dd/Xeniasushibabies2.png fabulous] life. 
[[Image:Xeniaskysalt.png|thumb|Dough sure knows how to excite a crowd. Sky Salt, 2005.]][[Image:Xeniswishfulthinking.jpg|thumb|Yeah fucking right.]]
===Failed Music Career===
In 2002, Dough started a "rock" [[band]] with her husband called [http://www.myspace.com/skysalt Sky Salt] that had so much trouble booking shows that Dough [[fail|had to rent her own club for a night]] just so that her band could finally play a show. Of course, this night was a failure, as it was confirmed that only 25 people showed up, most of which made the wise decision to leave before Dough's band even started playing.

{{quote |The first was a total joke and embarrassment, and I felt so bad for Xenia. Nobody watched the fashion show, yes there were really streamers and deflated balloons, and everyone was gone before her band came onstage. Bigtime fail, she lost a lot of $$ renting that place.| A former fan|color=#b3ea4c|size=400%}}

Despite this, she touted her show as a huge success, claiming that [[Bullshit|hundreds of people showed up and the media called her "the next Bjork."]] No evidence of this praise was ever found and any comments asking to see these reviews were promptly deleted. Sky Salt [http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=2939714&blogId=211565612 disbanded] in 2006.

As a result, Dough became so [[depressed]] the [http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/my-creative-journey following year] that she could barely even bring herself to post on livejournal anymore. However, she couldn't keep herself away from her computer for long and soon felt the overwhelming urge to further infest the internet by whoring herself out for more attention and money. Failing to take the hint from her first failed attempt at a career in music, she recorded some [http://www.myspace.com/doedeere horrible elevator muzak] and posted it on [[myspace]], [[Unrealistic Expectations|hoping to become discovered and therefore famous]].

{{quote |Hey, I'm Doe Deere - the disco diva from Brooklyn, NY. I was recently featured as Song of the Day on PopJustice and am currently #1 on Electroqueer's chart for the second week in a row!

This too resulted in failure, mostly because having shit pumped through one's head with a fire hose is more pleasant than listening to Dough's shitty excuse for music. With a failed clothing line and another failed music career, Dough was forced to get an [[job|IRL job]] to make [[money]] and started working at a bank in 2007.

==Lime Crime Makeup==
[[Image:Limecrimemakeup.jpg|thumb|left|Limecrimemakeup.com: a blatant display of narcissism.]][[Image:Doughdelusionsofgrandeur.png|thumb|Delusions of grandeur much?]]In 2008, Dough turned her money-sniffing talents to the cosmetics industry.  Realizing the internet is full of [[16 year old girls]] dumb enough to spend $16 on half a gram of glitter and [http://twitter.com/limecrime/status/8303356576 lap up her unhygienic makeup advice], she printed some unicorn stickers, slapped it on a bunch of wholesale jars, and called it Lime Crime makeup.

Dough's first step was to <s>work with chemists to make a brand new formula so that her eyeshadows would be the brightest on the market</s> place a giant order for wholesale micas from [http://tkbtrading.com/ TKB] and sell them at a 4000% markup. When a number of blogs reviewed her makeup and [http://www.lipsticksandlightsabers.com/2009/08/lime-crime-so-ordinary-it-should-be.html pointed out] that Dough lied about making her own eyeshadows, she decided to prove them wrong by [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB6HjDC-Y_E uploading a video of herself "making" eyeshadows]. Of course, this video bears no resemblance to a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nNgVxJ3BW8 video], made by the wholesaler she purchased her micas from, on how to make eyeshadows that was posted 2 years earlier (however, Dough managed to forget the gloves). She also posted a video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiF1--8YwVM doing a comparison swatch of LC shadows applied wet next to TKB micas applied dry].

After the entire internet realized she was just repackaging micas and selling them as eyeshadows, Dough realized that if she didn't start selling something else she'd be forced to get an actual job.  Thus, [http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y239/limecrime/blog/displayprorotype.jpg Lime Crime Lipsticks] were born.  Shaped like a bright pink [[tampon]] with a glittery unicorn sticker, Lime Crime lipsticks <s>revolutionized the makeup industry</s> sucked as bad as the eyeshadows did.

==Lime Crime vs. Internet Bullies==
[[Image:Limecrimeretraction.jpg|thumb|The retraction drafted by her Attorney at LOL.]]Like any good [[lolcow]] who tries to make money selling crap on the internet, Dough realized the only way she could silence the bad reviews about her makeup company was to threaten to [[lolsuit|sue]] anyone who said anything bad about her. She posted [http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/lime-crime-vs-internet-bullies in her blog], rallying all her [[sockpuppet|fans]] to take action.

{{quote|However, it’s become very clear that <b>these people see online bullying as a game</b>, and openly revel in the attention they’re getting. It’s my own fault partially – if you let a bully bully you for too long without fighting back, they begin to think they have the right to. Well, I will not stand for this any longer. I’m going to stand up and fight, and hope you can do this with me!|Doe Deere, [[asking for it]]|color=#b3ea4c|size=400%}}

Rather than just improve her shitty products, Dough called in her [[attorney at lol]] on one blogger, [http://gothique.wordpress.com/2009/11/17/lime-crime/ Gothique], demanding she take down the review (reposted [http://emeraldsrain.livejournal.com/149717.html here]) that said [[Truth|LC lipsticks were mediocre and overpriced]] and replace it with a scripted apology. At this very moment she is gathering her forces of sockpuppets to take down the internets, also known as the voices in Dough's head. And Mark.

[[Image:Xenisisabully.png|thumb|Critical thinking is now stupid according to the Unicorn Queen.]]Despite her abundance of tantrums over "bullies" conspiring against her (and her consequent [[BAWWWWW]]ing for attention and reassurance), Dough is more than willing to publicly accuse anyone that disagrees with her of being stupid:

==Shrinkle Obsession==

[[Image:Goofusgallant.jpg|center]]

[[Image:die.jpg|thumb|Plz be my friend, Shrinkle!]][[Image:Sockpuppet.jpg|thumb|Dough has many fans willing to jump to her defense.]]
===History===
Since 2002, Dough has had an [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/e/ec/Shrinkleripoff2.png unhealthy obsession] with Amy, aka [http://blog.shrinkle.com Shrinkle]. Initially friends (after eBay and friendster stalking Shrinkle for months), Shrinkle provided Dough with the Kryolan makeup she sold on eBay. This inspired Dough to set her makeup gun to "whore" and unleash step-by-step instructions on how to look like a two year old fingerpainted on your face, much to the [[lulz]] of the makeup artist community. Both would sell DIY clothing on eBay for hundreds of dollars with Shrinkle creating a design pattern and Dough [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/5/55/Shrinkleripoff.png unabashedly ripping it off] by the end of the week.

When Dough's powertrips in her [http://missmeganmaude.livejournal.com/38065.html livejournal communities] began alienating customers, Shrinkle [http://community.livejournal.com/meanestbastard/43997.html?thread=476125#t476125 parted ways] and continued to be successful, whilst Dough cried on her pile of poorly restitched Marilyn Manson t-shirts. As tears gave way to anger, she and [http://community.livejournal.com/meanestbastard/22203.html Mark] began sockpuppeting in livejournal communities under the name [http://community.livejournal.com/meanestbastard/80110.html prettypuppy48] to tell everyone how wonderful Lime Crime is and what a big bad drunk Shrinkle is, all the while publicly kissing Shrinkle's ass any time Shrinkle got any sort of press. 

In the meanwhile, Dough focused her bodysnatching on other online personalities such as [http://blog/johannaost.com Johanna Öst] and [http://supayana.blogspot.com Supayana]. Like Shrinkle, both girls eventually ran as fast as they could when they could no longer stand Dough's powertrips and smothering.

===Lime Crime vs. Sugarpill===
Fast forward to 2010, and the obsession continues. Shrinkle announces her upcoming launch for her own make-up brand, [http://sugarpill.net Sugarpill Cosmetics] and Dough begins sockpuppeting again, this time anonymously in a comment thread stemming from a [http://www.examiner.com/x-17390-Brooklyn-Beauty-Examiner~y2009m10d6-Is-it-a-Crime-to-Look-this-Good-Lime-Crime-Makeup poorly researched article] about Lime Crime micas. Taking time out from her busy-repouring-wholesale-mica-into-smaller-jars schedule, Dough brushed the cupcake crumbs off her Mickey Mouse sweater and started a troll campaign about how much Shrinkle is teh suxxorz and Lime Crime is not teh suxxorz. 

Customers and fans of Shrinkle would immediately jump to her defense and pwn Dough, so she would retreat back in to her [http://www.flickr.com/photos/limecrime/sets/72157622968307066/ Pepto Bismol vomit house] and check Craigslist to see if anyone responded to her "be my friend so haterz will like me" ad. 

Upon seeing that only Mark was responding to her ad, Dough immediately checks twitter to sees hundreds of people are buying Sugarpill, including Mark, who has bought two palettes to go along with the scarf he stole from Dough's mom's closet. While waiting for a response to her [[Butthurt]] form, she notices a page from one of her wholesale makeup catalogs stuck to the bottom of one of her ugly patio paint covered shoes. She immediately [http://www.flickr.com/photos/47566135@N06/4356500179/ takes] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/47566135@N06/4357246040/ pictures] of Mark's Sugarpill palettes along with the wholesale ad and posts them anonymously as "proof" that Shrinkle repackages her make-up from LaFemme.

A commenter on the article found out that the camera details on Dough's account [http://i45.tinypic.com/jg5xs1.jpg match up] to the camera details on the sockpuppet account. Dough then [[in the kitchen|went back to the kitchen]] and left huge mascara laden crocodile [[emo|tears]] all over her TKB stash and uneaten cupcakes from her [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxW-Vc7J1lQ tea party of fail]. Dough still [http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/7623/xeniaspeechless.png had the audacity to deny any wrongdoing] despite the existence of evidence to the contrary.

==Doe Deere Blogazine==

[[Image:Fungushair.jpg|thumb|{{squote|My hair has faded to gray-green. Honestly? The most amazing color!|Dough, a true style icon|color=#b3ea4c}}]]
After [[livejournal]] could no longer be bothered to give a shit about her, Dough did what every other pretentious attention whore with too much unwarranted self-importance does and turned to the [[blogosphere]], creating the [http://doedeereblogazine.com/ Doe Deere Blogazine] to showcase her "uniqueness." Featuring [[shit nobody cares about|"makeup tutorials, style & fashion tips, tales of living in NYC, as well personal musings from Miss Deere,"]] Dough's blog is basically a shittier and more obnoxious version of blogs like [http://www.galadarling.com/ galadarling.com] with even less credibility and [[original content]]. Regardless, she likes to believe that she is an inspiration and a role model to the 16 year old girls who read her blog and will post about how much they [http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/we-love-our-futurettes adore] and [http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/thank-you-sophie admire] her at every opportunity.

===Typical Content===
* Editorials: [[TL;DR]] articles where Dough pretends to be knowledgeable on a certain subject, thus making herself look like a complete twat. When she can't be bothered to think of something to write about, she'll just [http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/entrepreneurship-is-it-for-you plagiarize] [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/9/94/Xeniavspoppy.jpg someone else's writing].
* Excursions: For when Dough actually leaves her house. These entries often feature photos of her posing awkwardly with other people in attempt to appear [[nerd|popular]] and [[socializing|sociable]] IRL.
* Fun & Games: Instead of throwing away her cheap and unwanted garbage, Dough gives it away to one of her readers in attempt to seem kind and charitable.
* Inspiration: Entries full of stolen photos. No credit is given to the photographers because that would just take attention away from Dough. 
* Letters from Readers: Readers write to Dough asking for advice on how to be more like her, because she is just so [[bullshit|unique and inspirational]]. It is suspected that most of these "readers" are actually Dough herself, as that would give her another opportunity to praise herself.
* Makeup Tutorials: For anyone who wants to pile makeup on their face with both eyes shut. After all, who wouldn't want to look like [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Doedeerehalloween.jpg this]?
* Photoshoots: Because she can't possibly display her own face enough.
* Style Diary: Pictures of obnoxious outfits to appeal to teenagers who strive to be [[OMG]] [[poser|different]], in which Dough parades around looking like a colorblind fucktard.
* Unicorn Queen: More of Dough doing what she does best: talking about herself. In other words, nothing interesting is ever posted in this category.

Dough often tries to [http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/bideawee-to-the-rescue appear charitable] in her blog, but has  [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Doughisathief.png admitted to stealing] and thinks that it [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Doughisathief2.png is totally okay] (however she later removed the line about stealing the jacket from her blog). She also manages to lie at least 100 times in a single entry and is often unable to get her own story straight. For example: Dough originally claims that she moved to the US at [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Xenialies.jpg age 17]. Later on, she posted a [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Xenialies2.jpg blog entry] that said otherwise and then proceeded to delete fucking everything that stated that she moved at age 17.

Fortunately, most people above the age of 16 are able to see Dough's blog as the cesspool of [[crap|lies, hypocrisy, and garbage]] that it really is, as all the [[Shitting Rainbows|rainbows and glitter]] in the universe aren't enough to cover it up. For everyone else, there is...

===Team Candyfuture===

Still not satisfied with the amount of attention she was receiving, Dough decided to start a [http://www.limecrimemakeup.com/page.html?id=23 fan club] for herself. Those who have been successfully brainwashed may apply by kissing Dough's ass to prove that they are worthy, as "only [[losers|the best and most loyal]]" fans are chosen. Members, also known as "Futurettes," will often be found [[white knighting]] wherever anything bad is said about their "Unicorn Queen," insisting that the "[[haters]]" need to "[[get a life]]!!!!" This behavior can be seen in basically every 5 star comment posted [http://www.nylonmag.com/?section=article&parid=4444&rnd=qgr6 here]. The most [[pathetic|dedicated]] fans draw [http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/fanart fanart] of Dough for her to fap to.

After a blogger posted an [http://www.temptalia.com/lime-crime-lipsticks-reviews-photos-swatches unfavorable review] of Lime Crime lipsticks, Dough became butthurt and [http://lillianfunnyface.blogspot.com/2010/03/quick-lime-crime-drama-update.html sent an email to her minions], encouraging them to spam the blogger's personal email address to [[lie|tell her how great Lime Crime is]]. Meanwhile, Dough acted sweet to the reviewer to make herself look good.

==Animal Rights "Activism"==
[[Image:poison.jpg|thumb|Dough offers her cat the animal world equivalent of Baked Arsenic Alaska.]]These days, Dough's cause of the week seems to be animal lovers, particularly [[vegans]]. [http://twitter.com/limecrime/status/9385688038 Having no idea what a "vegan" is] ([[stupid|or a dictionary, for that matter]]), she pulled a Dough and decided that it must mean "hipster type stupid people with lots of money to give to meeeeeeee." She began advertising her [http://www.bideawee.org/press_room/press_releases/LimeCrime.pdf dirty kitchen micas and lipsticks as vegan], then asked people on twitter if vegan is a person, place or thing. 

When everyone told her to [[STFU]], she acted in typical butthurt fashion and refused to change any of her press releases, bios, or site information claiming that her [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine cochineal] laden products are vegan. Being the beacon of intelligent thought  that she is, Dough claimed that she's one too u guise except for [[meat|fish, burgers, chicken and veal]] on Fridays. And that she still wears fur; but it's okay, because her Mom forced her to and told her that New York winters made fur wearing an absolute MUST.

Clearly having not learnt her lesson from being outed for her previous animal charity [[scam]], she struck again by telling people to buy her lipsticks so she can donate the money to [http://www.bideawee.org/ Bide-A-Wee]. When asked what percentage of the profits would be donated to Bide-A-Wee, Dough responded by sticking her mica covered fingers in her ears and galloping off into the night on her hooves.

{{quote| We will be announcing the total amount at the end of the month. This is a contractual, percentage-based agreement with Bideawee. I am not at liberty to arbitrarily select an amount beforehand. I think the final amount (which I don’t know and can’t predict) will be more meaningful than X%.|color=#b3ea4c|size=400%}}

Other animal rights fubars committed by Dough include:

* [http://www.doedeereblogazine.com/articles/13-things-i-learned-in-london Failing at vegetarianism] in [http://www.happycow.net/travel/top_five.html one of the world's most vegetarian friendly-cities.]
* Not realizing she should save the seals because she didn't know how cute they were

==A Psychological Analysis==
'''This Person is Completely Fucking Insane'''<br />
''By Bob Williams, [[Doctor|clinical psychologist]]''<br />

Psychologically speaking, the individual Doe Deere exhibits behaviors that can be described as nothing short of "[[Insane|fucking insane]]". These behaviors include but are not limited to: having delusions of grandeur, being a complete [[attention whore]] and a [[hypocritical]] bitch, and having no empathy. Upon closer examination, it becomes evident that this individual's fucked up combination of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#Diagnostic_criteria_.28ICD-10.29 narcissistic] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder#Characteristics histrionic] personality disorders leads to such high levels of [[unwarranted self-importance]] and such a desperate need for [[attention]] that the diagnosis of "fucking insane" is not enough to explain it and a diagnosis of "completely fucking insane" is necessary.

This [[illness]] is severe and is based on repressed feelings of inferiority combined with a desperate need for admiration and fame. Individuals like Doe Deere will display a complete disregard for others, an insanely high need for attention, and a strong sense of entitlement, all of which manifests itself in relationships. Such a completely fucking insane individual will become fixated upon famous personalities who possess actual talent, [[Desperate|desperately]] trying to emulate them and be their [[friend]], though the relationships always lack actual depth due to the fact that the individual is completely insane. Such relationships will inevitably come to an end once the "friend" realizes the true extent of Dough's insanity and proceeds to gets the fuck away from her, which is what all psychologists strongly advise. 

[[Image:Doedeereattentionwhore.jpg|thumb|Asking for it.]]{{squote| I used to be friends with Xenia. Emphasis on PAST TENSE. Xenia is a greedy, power-hungry megalomaniac who picks her friends based on popularity and what they can do to make her famous. In the beginning, she desperately clung to Shrinkle and Supayana's coattails to get famous. We all knew what was going on, but Amy and Yana were too sweet to say anything. Behind the scenes, Xenia bragged about all the shady things her popularity allowed her to get away with: shillbidding on eBay, telling her fans she's an extreme animal lover while secretly supporting the fur industry, selling $5 children's toy sunglasses on eBay for $40 claiming they are real adult-sized sunglasses, and how easy it is to lie as long as you have great marketing and PR. She is just so morally corrupt, we all chose to distance ourselves from her. Xenia had real friends once, but not anymore. Now she only has internet celebrities she latches onto for photo ops. But if that's the life she chose for herself, then so be it.| A former friend speaks out|color=#b3ea4c|size=400%}}

Because it is impossible for the completely fucking insane to attribute any fault to themselves, they will often use the psychological phenomenon of "projection" to deny that they are pathetic [[Fail|failures]], therefore placing the blame upon others. This leads to [[internet drama]] and even further insanity, which is clearly displayed in Dough's persistent attempts to sabotage Shrinkle and to convince everyone else of her own [[Delusion|superiority]]. In addition, Dough's insanity sometimes sparks [http://twitter.com/RealAudreyKitch/status/6642168681 lulzy] [http://twitter.com/RealAudreyKitch/status/6642104704 fights] with other useless attention whores.

Completely fucking insane individuals will frequently [[lie]] intentionally and without any remorse, despite how ridiculous the claim is and how much evidence exists against it. Additionally, people like Doe Deere have an inability to feign normalcy, modesty, and genuine kindness, but will still attempt to do so in a pathetic manner, therefore generating many [[lulz]].

'''Prospects:''' Because those diagnosed as "completely fucking insane" deny that there is anything wrong with them, psychologists generally consider the illness untreatable and those afflicted by this condition "beyond help". Due to this, the psychological community believes that Doe Deere will continue to infest the [[tubes]] to show off her [[Retarded|special]] personality, providing endless opportunities for entertainment.
