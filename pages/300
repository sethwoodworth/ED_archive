Aimee Major Steinberger

'''''Although Aimee Major Steinberger has grown up and become a [[NORP]], there is still potential for lulz, but this article needs the attention of a [[weeaboo]] expert.'''''

'''Aimee Major Steinberger''', formerly known only as '''Aimee''' was the top queen bitch of the [[Dollfie]] and Ball Jointed Doll world.  From atop her throne of Sanrio and [[Wapanese]] she alone directs the lives of thousand of [[Otaku]] willing to shell out the $3000 for a fucking barbie doll.  She makes a rather odd statement of herself, being the epitome of all that is horrid, as she is a [[furry]], [[wapanese]], [[otherkin]] [[attention whore]].

==[[Dollfie]] Fandom==

In the high pitched and cut throat world of large human shaped dildos, only one reigns supreme from the high perch of her [http://denofangels.com Den of Angels]. And that would be Aimee, who decides the world of Dollfie as she will, much like that creepy kid from Twilight Zone with the cornfield.  In a world where even the most rabid collectors have at most 3 or 4 of these overpriced [[wapanese]] monstrosities, Aimee has over '''20'''.  This cannot be stressed enough, '''she has at least 20 of them'''. 

===Den of Angels===
Den of Angels is Aimee's own personal stomping ground, where she goes to whore herself out, and make sure that everyone remembers the queen bitch is her.  Her moderator underlings are hardly much better, such as the fantastically piggish [[Cassiel]].  People get the ban hammer simply for 'being mean' which ranges from simple swearing to being 'rude' to a fellow doll.  Yes, rude to dolls.  The place is an [[Otherkin]] wonderworld.  But better make sure your object of sexual obsession is made in Japan by Volks and made of resin with [[gay|ball joints]] and elastic, and not one of those horrible [[Good Korea]]n ripoffs, or else [[B&|you're out on your ear]], mister.  I mean lady.  NO [[het|STRAIGHT MALE]] OWNS THESE THINGS.

As of March 2009, Aimee is no longer the owner of the [[Dolljoints|Den of Angels]] because with 99% of the companies being Korean, it's just not a [[weeaboo]] enough hobby for her anymore.  Because BJDs aren't Japanese anymore, Aimee has been trading her old dollfies for [[Chris-chan|anime blow-up dolls]] because she doesn't want to be mistaken for being a [[Yu-Gi-Oh|Koreaboo.]]

Her [[DESU|most expensive doll]] was traded for another [[Tranny|penis.]]

==[[Cosplay|Cosplay]] Fandom==
This is still an [[Africa|emerging world]] for Aimee, as she has only recently noticed that if she stopped eating, those silly layers of lard would go away, and then people would [[whore|throw money at her]] in order to help her buy costume pieces.  After all, being [[fat]] is fine for Lord of The Rings 'costuming' but not for cosplay!  

As with all folks stepping into the [[fandom]] of [[Cosplay]], Aimee is currently an underling of Adella, making cheap costume pieces for the queen bitch of [[kawaii]].  At this point she's got a smaller fanclub than Adella, and most of those are her original [[Dollfie]] [[fangirls]], but she's moving up in the world...  She's even won at Cons!  Woooo!  Which I suppose is like winning top nerd in the nerd show.

==[[EGL|Gothic Lolita]]==

Despite being [[Fat|HUEG]] and therefore not a very good [[lolita]] at all, Aimee bravely sews and buys her way into the OTHER hideously expensive [[wapanese]] hobby, [[EGL|Gothic Lolita]] [[ugly|fashion]].  She often laments her hideous, awful, fucking [[HUEG]] size 11 feet, which must mean she has a very big [[penis]] as well if the saying is right.

==Geisha==
[[Image:Wapanese-aimee-1.jpg|thumb|right|Facial reconstruction complete. Aimee now looks like a cheap geisha.]]
As a fan of everything [[Ugly|cute]] and [[Japan|Japanese]], Aimee has dived right into the fandom for the high class world of [[Prostitute|Geisha]].  She proves just how [[old meme|old school]] she is by being in the old skool hideously expensive wapanese hobby, collecting kimono.  Besides her doll forums and cosplay forums, one can find her on the [http://www.immortalgeisha.com/ig_bb/index.php Immortal Geisha Forums.]  These forums are full of her kind and full of potential lulz. Her abilities to sing, dance, and suck someone off are woefully unknown at this point in time.  

Recently, Aimee has gone back to Japan for a visit and decided to undergo complete facial reconstruction to look ASIAN.  Unfortunately, the surgery didn't work so well with her husband and he remains Caucasian-looking.

==Takarazuka== 
[[Image:Aimeeisaman.jpg|thumb|right|Aimee so desperately wishes she was a musicaly talented lesbian, and it shows.]]
For every force in the world there is a equal but separate entity.  Therefore Japan's answer to musical theater is stocked sky high with... no, not [[Hentai|octopi]], but [[Lesbian|LESBIANS!]]  Takarazuka is nothing but [[Bishounen|women in drag]] molesting women in pretty dresses and sparkles and music and dancing and ohhhh what a <i>fabulous</i> spectacle!  Aimee has attached herself to this fandom like a desperate little gay man with [[AIDS|AIDS]] to [[Crap|RENT]].

==Her 'Real' Job==  
[[Image:Chibisimpsons.jpg|thumb|right|Apparently it's shit like this that made Fox News consider this good use ofwaste a  money.  Wonder if they know how she spends it.]]
You might be asking yourself, ED Interwebs?  How can one girl and an army of fans fund all this?

The answer is simple.  Somehow drawing [[shit|shitty]] artwork and owning a bunch of [[wapanese]] [[dildo]]s is enough for you to get hired by [[Fox News]] and work in their animation division making cartoons for [[Sean Hannity]] and [[Bill O'Reilly]].  She's been made one of the head animators for Futurama, so if you hate the new episodes, blame her for it [[for the lulz|just because]].

==Someone Paid Aimee to Go Be A Weeaboo in Japanz?==
In December 2007, a [[noob|start up]] manga publisher named GoComi decided to unleash Aimee's paticular brand of weeabooism on the world, a "travel manga" called <i>Japan Ai: A Tall Girl's Adventures in Japan</i>.  A much more accurate title would of been Japan Ai: Aimee Major and Her Friends [[masturbate|Masturbate Furiously]] in Japan, as the book is nothing but shitty drawings and stories of Aimee and her fatter friends from HCC Cosplay fawning over everything else mentioned in this article.  While Aimee does play off her giantess stature in the book for lulz, she fails to address that she is not [[kawaii]] at all and the friends she brought with her make her look really fucking hot by comparison.  [[just as planned|Maybe that was her plan all along when she brought them with her]].  You can find the book in any place that sells manga to the unwashed masses, feel free to flip through it if you are in need of a good [[lol|laugh]].
