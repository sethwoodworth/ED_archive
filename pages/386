Alt-0173
Also known as '''alt+0173''', is a key combination executed by holding down the ALT key and typing '0173'. Your computer then substitutes a (normally) undisplayed soft hyphen, Unicode character U+00AD. This is a common trick used on the [[internets]] for many purposes, such as bypassing [[wordfilter|wordfilters]], to maintain forced anon by choice after [[The Great Re/b/oot]] (the character would make the name display a blank name rather than "Anonymous"), and to post using [[moot]]'s [[tripcode]] without getting [[b&]].

To experience the [[emo|wonderous]] [[jenkem|natural high]] caused by this character:
# Hold down the Alt key and type "0173" (without the quotes, [[newfag]]). 
# Its hexadecimal value is %C2%AD and its HTML code is &amp;#173;.
# ?????
# PROFIT!!!

Then sit back and enjoy, knowing that in some small way you're [[anal sex|sticking it]] to [[The Man]].
