"'''Women do not their shower'''" - WTF is this shit? It's a [[forced meme]] - learn'em while you can. Can be used as a generic response to any statement, no matter how [[redundant]], or senseless it may be in said context. For example: 


<font face="Courier New">
:: '''[10:38] <+Sowrcreem>'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hey how do i rejister a chan?
:: '''[10:39] <@Shoopderwhoop>''' Because women do not their showers.
:: '''[10:39] <+Sowrcreem>'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; umm wat?
:: '''[10:39] <@Shoopderwhoop>''' That's how.
:: '''[10:39] <+Sowrcreem>'''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ok

[[Image: Women do not their shower2.png|thumb|right|680px|The [[rape|raping]] of the original typo, leading to total [[mindfuck]]. [[You]] know you want to read the description...]] 

Spawned during an argument and shown in [[purportedly]] [[lulzy]] (though clearly not) logs (see above).

* When using this meme in actual chat, be sure to use it when it makes the least sense.
* If a person questions you or does not understand, simply disregard it, and say "''It's because women do not their showers''"
* Try not use it [[evar|too much]] or people will view you as an unoriginal [[n00b]], which they probably already do.
* If using this [[IRL]], you should probably stand there awkwardly for at least 30 seconds after vocalizing, as people are 99.99% likely to not know what the fuck you're talking about.
