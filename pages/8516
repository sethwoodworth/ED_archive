The '''Transgender Day of Remembrance''', held on the 20th of November, is the day of the year when all [[transsexual|trannies]] BAWWW and pledge to [[Never forget|NEVAR FORGET]] their [[buttsecks|fallen angels]]. It was started on the internets site [http://www.gender.org/ Gender.org] when the [[BFF]] of site owner [[Shemale|Gwendolyn Ann Smith]] was brutally murdered [[for the lulz]] in 1998 setting off a series of [[emo]] internets drama which expanded to [[IRL]] in a short time. 

Just one year later in (surprise, surprise) [[San Francisco]] a [[gay|candlelight vigil]] was held for fallen fgts. Since then, the event has spread like [[AIDS]] in a bathhouse to the entire fucking world all from a lame internets site which [http://www.gender.org/remember/about/core.html has yet to discover] the concept of ''professional design''.

==Webcomics Project==
The "[http://www.dolari.org/dor/index.htm Transgender Day of Remembrance Webcomics Project]" is an internets BAWWWing competition created by the tranny who wrote ''[http://www.venusenvy.keenspace.com Venus Envy]'' and some other tranny who wrote ''[http://www.dolari.org/cs/ Closetspace]'' and was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jenn_Dolari chased off Wikipedia for writing vanity articles].

In this "Project", eleventy zillion webcomic writer/illustrators dedicate their [[basement dweller|precious time and talent]] into remembering dead trannies with heartfelt sorrow by taking over the internets for a day. It was originally just a cross over between ''Venus Envy'' and ''Closetspace'' in 2004 but quickly infected every other comic in the world, like Hep C from [[prison]] rape.
