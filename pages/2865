'''Fantards''' are [[obsession|obsessive]] [[fan]]s who worship others' creative works because they have [[Attention Whore|no talent, or lives of their own]]. While "fans" of these works are often enthusiastic about their preferred movies, books, or TV shows, fantards are distinguished by their inability to distinguish fiction from reality, and their devotion to [[serious business]], and the retarded [[iPhone | iPhone]].

Often, fantards are obsessed with a specific character from their selected fandom, regarding him/her as a [[sex]] [[god]] to the point of near-[[Insane|insanity]]. Some are dedicated to a certain [[OTP]], or "one true pairing," and will defend this pairing [[Avatar_the_Last_Airbender#Zutara|despite all evidence to the contrary.]] Most [[slashfic]] and [[fanfic]] authors are fantards who can't live without poorly-written pr0n of their two favorite characters boinking.

Persons suffering from an advanced state of fantardedness will become [[Suethors]], writing about self-insert fantasy characters having sex with their favorite canon characters. After reaching a certain level of obsession, a fangirl becomes a [[completist]]. Other symptoms of fatal fantardism are engagement in [[cosplay]] and [[RPG|roleplaying]].

Fantards are extremely susceptible to becoming [[furries]] or [[otherkin]].

The gender-specific terms for fantards are '''fanboy''' (or, even more obnoxiously, '''fanboi''') and '''fangirl'''. These are not age-specific, since some fantards well into their 40s and 50s still cosplay teenage superhero characters. Can you imagine an 80-year-old woman who dresses up like Xena: Warrior Princess? Probably. But you don't want to -- it's hideous. Her skin is more leathery than the costume.

The average lifespan of a fantard on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] is [[tilde|~]] 8 minutes.

==Trolling a Fantard==
Most fantards are first in line for any new installment of their favorite fandom, but if there's any ''possible'' way you can beat them to the punch, the [[lulz]] potential is nearly infinite. Fantards hate spoilers like fire, and dropping bombs like [[Snape kills Dumbledore]], [[Aeris]] dies, [[Jack Sparrow]] dies and [[Harry Potter|Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix]] will guarantee page after page of shrieking sexually-repressed rage.

An easier way of trolling fantards is to enter a fan community and post something mildly dismissive or critical. It doesn't help to go overboard, as every fandom has one or two halfway-clever people who can recognize an obvious troll; in these cases, it's better to come up with something totally mundane, like "I think J.K. Rowling is having trouble wrapping up her plotlines in a reasonable amount of time," or "I thought the third ''Pirates'' movie was overly complicated for the sake of unnecessary plot twists." The fantards will descend upon you like vultures, appalled that anyone would dare criticize their beloved fandom, and you'll have the bonus pleasure of starting fights among the fans, as some of them will agree with you.

== Stages of Fantardism ==

===n00b fantard=== 
Fantards under the age of 14 are generally relegated to writing brief [[histrionic]] reviews of [[fanfiction]]. Once having reached that tender age, they may begin posting their own fanfiction on the [[internets]]. It should be noted that few fantards at this stage read, write, or draw pr0n, finding such things disgusting (except for a few creepy early bloomers).


===Teenage Fantard=== 
At the age of fifteen or sixteen, fantards begin to take an interest in slash, [[furries]], and [[goths]]. Fangirls of this age are singlehandedly responsible for 70% of all [[Mary Sue]] fanfiction. Typical works include [[songfic]]s about [[Naruto]] and Sasuke discovering their passionate love for one another and sprouting tails. It should be noted that [[songfic]]s are written only because most [[16 year old girls]] lack the ability to make [[AMV]]s. Fanboys, by contrast, are exercising their newly-discovered skills of an artist in an attempt to draw breasts that resemble nothing found in nature, or even in porn.


===Jaded Fangirl===
Around the age of 18 or 19, fantards begin to realize the sheer pointlessness of it all. At this stage they begin to write [[emo|deep]], [[Slashfic|soulsearching]] [[shit|fanfiction]] and post on fan message boards about how [[1337]] they are, and how they aren't as stupid as when they were fourteen (they are actually just as stupid but hide it behind seniority and big words like "poignant"). Most fanfiction produced at this stage is in the form of drabbles, fanfics which are less than a hundred words long because at this age even fantards are forced by their cruel parents to hold down jobs (except [[Meele]], who is a not-for-profit [[stalker]]).

===Middle-Aged Fantard===
Beginning around age 25, these fantards stay up all night arguing with people on the internet. Since most have their own jobs and shitty apartments by now, they are able to spend every penny of their disposable income on figurines, sourcebooks, DVDs, and manga. Though they strenuously claim to be living their lives just as they always wanted to, their shame is obvious in the number of middle-aged fantards who pretend to be fourteen. 

==Fanboys vs. Fangirls==
[[Image:Bloody-megaman.jpg|thumb|Megaman drawn with menstrual blood. WIMMIN WIN]]
Though obsessive behavior characterizes all fantards, there is a clear difference between fanboys and fangirls, as proven by totally scientific observation.
*Fangirls are more likely to write fanfiction with self-insert characters.
*While both draw pornographic art, both are just as likely to mess up anatomy, but in different ways. Boys will draw tits not even that three-boobed chick from ''Total Recall'' would recognize, and girls will, more often than not, give a male a penis that looks like a carrot or a penis that is [[Epic Fail|'''''upside-down''''']].
*Fangirls are more likely to rip off anime/manga styles.
*Fangirls get off from writing slashfic involving canon characters, while fanboys are usually content to find pr0n and masturbate to it while reading manga and eating RAMEN.
*Fanboys tend to bring weird-ass fetishes, like inflation or [[babyfur|diapers]], into a perfectly normal fandom.
*Fangirls construct elaborate fictions about their own lives, whether it's meeting actors/writers or needing thousands of dollars for a life-saving operation.
*Fanboys can be found in realms not traditionally thought of as "fandoms;" examples include [[Linux]] partisans and [[Apple]] fanatics.
*Fangirls reportedly smell like old meat and cat pee, while fanboys simply smell like wet burlap and Jergens hand lotion.

==Types of Fantard==
===[[animu|Anime]] fantards===

Anime fantards watch generic [[Harem Animu|Harem Anime]] like ''[[Love Hina]]'' or shonen anime like ''[[Naruto]]'' or ''[[Inuyasha]]''. They also enjoy listening to [[Rush]] and choking down massive amounts of [[pocky]] to retain their status as uber-[[1337]] [[weeaboo]]. 

They also claim to [[bullshit|"speak a bit of Japanese"]], more appropriately the know the meaning of "[[kawaii]]" and "[[baka]]". [[wapanese|Animu fangirls]] listen to Japanese bands [[j-pop|because they're Japanese]], while animu fanboys listen to faggy anime or video game music. During brief emo periods, however, they listen to [[My Chemical Romance]]. 

Usually after this they return to make hundreds of ''[[Dragonball Z]]'' [[AMV]]s all cut to [[Linkin Park]].  They'll eventually go to college and join the ranks of [[Anonymous]] on [[/b/]], jerking to loli porn all day. 

The fangirls of this category tend to find male animu character hot just because they have long effeminate hair (to compensate for the fact they don't have any around there p3n0rs) because clearly you don't have to pay attention to how anti-social or what an asshole they are. However, the fact that most men in animu look like this proves they're all [[gay]]. Sorry fangirls, but they'll never be interested in any of you.

Japanese RPG fantards are essentially the same breed, except they spend even moar time in their basements because they're trying to beat ''Final Fantasy'' games on their emulators.

===Comic book fantard===
Comic fantards come in two shapes and equally distinguishable sizes. There are anime fantards who insist on reading their comic books backwards and whine about the translation, and American comic fantards who obsess over the latest Spiderman release or graphic Novel.

American fantards obsess over the Watchmen and [[Scott Pilgrim]], while constantly increasing their contribution to the Marvel universe through investments in stacks of cartoons. They will often create batshit alternate storylines and baw when they are unable to purchase the next issue because they spent too much time sitting on their ass editting ED instead of getting a job. 

===Console and OS fantards=== 
The most vicious people in all the [[internets]], console fanboys (or [http://www.destructoid.com/fanboyism-should-be-called-religous-fandamentalism-158334.phtml console fandamentalists]) are all convinced that entertainment systems rule the world and anyone who plays a system different to theirs is "evil." In their mind, Microsoft is [[Nazi]]sm, Sony is [[capitalism]], Nintendo is [[communism]], and SEGA is [[Ann Coulter]]. Master Chief is [[Jesus]], except when you mention that fratboys play Halo. 

[[Linux]] and [[Macintosh]] fantards share the belief that Microsoft is Satan, but they have an aura of Holy [[Muslim|Jihand]] because they think that regular computer use is far, far more important than gaming. They're also incapable of explaining why the average user should switch to a completely new system because of some perceived "benefit" that consists of nerd-cred.

Constantly in a state of flustered, impotent nerd rage, they're usually fat, acne-ridden and have an IQ of five or so. The only way of getting a techie fantard out of this state is by [[pain series|intense psychological therapy]] which may have some side effects, like being an [[emo]] fag. There are no female console or OS fantards, as the very sight of a console fanboy is enough to make any woman, no matter how stupid, run screaming.

==== DMC4 Petition ====

Some time ago, it was announced that [[Devil May Cry]] 4 would no longer be a [[PS3]] exclusive, being ported to the [[Xbox 360]]. Butthurt, the PS3 [[faggot]]s decided to BAWWWWWWW at Capcom with [[Shit nobody cares about|a petition which will do absolutely nothing]]. [http://www.petitiononline.com/capcompe/petition.html Seriously].

{{quote|We ([[unwarranted self importance|The people that have signed this petition]]) [[cool story bro|feel very left out]] in your decision to make Devil May Cry 4 a Multi-Platform title, and [[Nobody Cares|hereby agree to boycott your sale of Capcom affiliated games]]. This is due to your decision [[wat|to turn your back]] on your most faithful gaming company. For years we have enjoyed games, we have reaped the [[goatse|benefits]] of your committment to Sony. [[Butthurt|We]] find it absolutely demoralizing for not only the gamers, but also [[God|Sony itself]]. We want you to know that will not, and should not stand for your actions, [[virgin|and therefore withold our option of buying your product]].|[[fucktard|The Undersigned]]||color=silver|size=100%}}

You can show Capcom what you think about the petition by spamming the hell out of it, leaving your vandalism for all the idiotic to see. [[DO IT FAGGOT]].

===[[Furry|Furries]]=== 
Once "[[fursecution]]" made the scene, furries became fantards in-practice in addition to [[sick fucks]], making them the most easily [[troll]]ed group to ever exist.  God bless their little broken brains.

Many furries contend that they are only interested in children's cartoons, such as TaleSpin or Rescue Rangers, not porn. Being furries, they do not realize that this is even more disturbing.

===[[fag|Cliques]]=== 
While these exist [[IRL]], the advent of the Internets boom has let clique members congregate together and multiply. Most fantard breeding occurs on [[drama|social]] [[pedophile|networking]] sites such as [[MySpace]], [[Vampirefreaks]], [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[DeviantART]] and [[Bebo]]. Most Internets clique members stay in their houses for years, taking pictures in the mirror and worshiping and defending bands like [[My Chemical Romance]], System of a Down, Fall Out Boy, [[Gackt]], Trivium and Mayhem, in typical fantard fashion. Others are devoted to lolcows like [[Tila Tequila]] or [[Jeffree Star]] (see [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=158505144 Jeffree Moon)].

===[[Music]] Fantards===
[[Image:ExampleOfJonasFantards.jpg|thumb|Typical [[Boyband]] Fantards]]
Although [[music]] fantards usually develop around boybands and shitty [[MTV]] rappers and pop <strike>gods</strike> <strike>artists</strike> performers, it can develop in any genre. Some genres which have developed many fantards include [[Juggalo]], [[emo]], [[Shit|nu metal]], [[black metal]], and [[goth]].
