Ae-tan
[[File:Ae-tanWikipe-tanObligatory.png|thumb|left|A causality paradox exists as to whom created whom.]]
[[File:3rdplace cracked.png|thumb|350px|Sadly, AE-tan only came third in [http://www.cracked.com/article_17341_5-terrifying-bastardizations-wikipedia-model.html Cracked.com's 5 Terrifying Bastardizations of the Wikipedia Model]. However, [[some argue]] the nazi did deserve to win.]]

'''Ae-tan''' (also known as ''AE-tan'', ''æ-tan'', ''Helpedtan'', and ''EDTan'') is the moe [[anthro|anthropomorphism]] and mascot of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Classy, [[rich and beautiful]], she is the rival of [[Wikipe-tan]], the meager maid who serves this role for [[Wikipedia]]. [[Some argue]] that she is [[Girlvinyl]] herself.

==Creation==
Ae-tan was envisioned by [[Sheneequa]] to be the counterpart to Wikipe-tan, because if they can be anime fgts so can we. [[User:Mungbean|Mungbean]] aka fapman would later do all of the legwork and actually create the fucking thing. She was also especially spread by [[Tyciol]], who is a dirty pedo piece of <s>shit</s> '''feces'''. Fapman would later be rewarded with sysops and [[moe|more art requests]]. The original [[EDF]] upload is located [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showpost.php?p=103613&postcount=93 here].

Fapman, a known rider of the [[virginmobile]], is known to have literally hundreds of ae-tans in his house that he refuses to upload.
