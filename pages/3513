The '''Guerrilla News Network''', or [http://www.gnn.tv GNN], is dedicated to giving [[13 year old boys]] and hairy militia lunatics a place to feel at home[http://fuckshitpiss.gnn.tv/blogs/8114/Fuck_Shit_Piss].

While it has been a playground for [[trolls]], it has also been a haven for [[Insane|fringe loonies]] and [[Internet drama]]. [http://www.gnn.tv/forum/thread.php?id=3780 This thread] is an excellent example of multiple [[sockpuppets]] going at each other.

==History==
GNN was founded in 2000, when [http://anthony.gnn.tv/ Anthony Lappe] and [http://silverback.gnn.tv Stephen Marshall] met. A whirlwind [[sex|romance]] developed into a long-term relationship, and with the financial backing of [http://yoshiwa.gnn.tv/ some other people] a network was born, aimed at 13-25 year-olds, thanks to Lappe's experience with [[MTV]].

===GNN is Ded===
The site died four years later, when Lappe left Marshall for [http://www.stolen.la/jessey Jizzy "Neo" White-Sinus], a pretty pretty princess, and created the Version 2 beta. Sinus is also the Jew responsible for converting the site to teh ev0l [http://textism.com/tools/textile/ textile]. Sinus enjoys sunsets, cappuccino mocha [[semen]] lattes, and [[Computer Science III]].

The site lives on as a sort of [[Jesus|unholy Zombie]], featuring [http://neverknwo.gnn.tv/ blogs], user-submitted [http://www.gnn.tv/articles/1421/US_s_FAVORITE_BOGEYMAN_FORESHADOWS_INVASION articles] and [http://gnn.tv/headlines/4251/Rivers_of_Coke headlines], and a [http://www.gnn.tv/forum/thread.php?id=7305 forum] to [[troll]].

A favorite pastime in the forum is to [[F5|obsessively watch]] the thread where you claim you're [[Quitting IRC forever|never coming back]]:[http://www.gnn.tv/threads/16406/I_am_leaving_and_this_time_for_good][http://www.gnn.tv/forum/thread.php?id=2405][http://www.gnn.tv/forum/thread.php?id=2469][http://www.gnn.tv/forum/thread.php?id=3862][http://www.gnn.tv/forum/thread.php?id=3646][http://www.gnn.tv/forum/thread.php?id=6724][http://www.gnn.tv/forum/thread.php?id=7230][http://www.gnn.tv/forum/thread.php?id=2463].

==GNN Hates ED==
Once upon a time, ED wrote an article about a right-wing neo-[[Nazi]] fucko named [[Feltcho]]. Feltcho wasn't happy at being outed as a Jew-hater, and his attempts to get ED to remove the article culminated in a series of frustrated telephone calls to ED members including Weevlo, who called him up and got him to admit to being [[pwn|owned]] by [[Bantown]].

This upset the Gay Nazi Network, which called Weevlos a "Jewish punk" and descibed his actions as being "Despicable (although very Jewish)" [http://www.gnn.tv/threads/10433/Did_Fetch_Get_Encyclopedia_Dramatic_Shuttered], because obviously when you're trying to convince people that you're not a Nazi, it's best to align yourself with a group who throw around the word "Jewish" as an insult. Well, we do that too, obviously, but we're ''special''.

To prove how racist they are, the GNN also plan to shut down the upstanding [[GNAA|Gay Nigger Association of America]] [http://www.gnn.tv/threads/10438/Anthony_GNAA_Begins_Tomorrow]. This plan consists of drinking Mountain Dew and making threats buried under several tons of mixed metaphors and run-on sentences:

The clock is now ticking on whether you wish to do what is right and eliminate these people and lock down their IP addresses to prevent them from slipping back into their predictable stalking and harassing activities.|30 Nov 2005}}

Over two years later, the GNN steamroller appears to have gotten lost.
