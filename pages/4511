The Kaufman Prize is a hyper-annual award whose ceremonies are conducted in the Trollocratic Oligarchy of [[Bantown]]. It is given to the unique few who have distinguished themselves by producing outstanding [[lulz]], invented groundbreaking techniques or [[software]], or made outstanding contributions to demagoguery.

The Prize is named for the late [[Andy Kaufman]], who is considered by modern scholars of trollery to be the most successful [[troll]] of all, surpassing even [[Hitler]], [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Gandhi]].
