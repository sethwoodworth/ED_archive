The Rejection Line
[[Image:Rejection-Hotline-Logo.jpg|center|400px]]
==History==
The rejection line is a general purpose trolling device used to let ridiculous and creepy people know that they are not worthy of real social contact. All text messages sent to it are posted on [[#External Links|their website]]

==[[YOU]]==
Hey, you're a [[douche|pretty cool guy]] right? You just haven't gotten much luck lately, but things are bound to pick up soon. A friend of a friend of a guy that you work with says it'd probably be cool if you went to a party he's throwing tonight, and whilst you're mingling with some awesome people you see her. Eyes like sapphires, hair like golden sand and a smile that makes you melt, you just need to talk to this girl. Things seem to be going so well. She's constantly looking over her shoulder (probably to make sure her boyfriend is not around), and she keeps letting you buy her drinks. Dude, you're totally going to get laid tonight, the deal just needs closing. You ask if she wants to go back to your place, but after a long, comfortable silence in which you look into her eyes for what seems like an eternity she says she has work in the morning. You ask for her number. She gives you it. You are waiting to go home and call her. She is flirting with you hard. You say your goodbyes and grab a taxi and head home. You grab your phone you start dialing her number. You finish the last number and you are so excited. Some guy picks up the phone. Its not her. Why didn't she answer the phone. She just wasn't that into you. You have been rejected.

===You idiot===
Always offer to send a txt to the girl right then and there, "so that we both have each other's number". She has to give you her number, so you can send a txt to her. Hell: offer her your phone so she can put in her own number herself. Type in the message "Dave, Friday, sleazy nightclub X" - all she has to do is type in her number and press send. Then you "check to see she got the message" on her phone. If she won't do it, put one in her drink (or pick your nose and stir her drink with it - less potential for accidents) and move on. You are wasting your time, and seeping precum into your underpants for no reason.

==Uses==
*Ensuring that fat ass skank from the club can not contact you.
*asking that creepy guido leave you alone, although he may be aware of the rejection line, having been given that number at least 5 times in the same night.
*<s>Making otherwise awesome people want to kill themselves simply because they do not always make a great first impression.</s> HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS
*Allowing self entitled douchebags to think that they have standards.
*Because how else are you going to figure out that no one wants you?
