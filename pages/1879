{{spoiler|Nomad takes down the battleship and goes back to the island. An open-ended game!}}

<b>''Crysis''</b> is a <s>game</s> glorified tech demo that cannot be run on any computer due to its [[Shit|awesome]] graphics. EA thought that it would be a great idea to make a game with [[shit nobody cares about|the best graphics ever]]. To do this, they used the CryEngine2 graphics engine which was, in hindsight, a rather appropriate name. Even though the graphics for ''Crysis'' were lifelike, the system requirements were so high that you needed a fucking NASA computer to play. Many of the other gamers that were stupid enough to spend millions of dollars on their supercomputer (which would be outdated in a matter of months) were [[pwnt]] by seeing that their computers could not run the game. The gamers were then forced to run the game in low resolution creating [[butthurt]] and [[Baw|bitching]] in the process.<br>

==Storyline==
Basically, it is the same shit as ''Far Cry'' with a simple, shitty storyline involving aliens. Nomad, the main character in the game is sent on to an island that's loaded with [[Korean|gooks]]. Throughout the game you have to kill tons of gooks to get to your objective. Suddenly, in the middle of the game, huge mechanical [[Tentacle rape|tentacle monsters]] appears out of no where and kill everything by freezing things to death. The player miraculously does not die unlike everyone else everyone around him and saves the day. [[Disney|The ending was a happy ending]]. The End.

[[Some argue]] that the story was a replica of ''Far Cry''. Both games, ''Far Cry'' and ''Crysis'', involved tons of [[Gooks|foreigners]] and the gameplay style is the same. The only real difference is the graphics and different characters. Other than that, ''Crysis'' is the same shit as ''Far Cry''.

The storyline for Crysis extremely thin and unimaginative, your average 5 year old could have thought up something better than this in about 15 minutes. The game was made to be used as a vehicle to sell graphics cards and other PC hardware. To put things simply, it's more of an interactive benchmark than an actual video game.

==Characters==

[[Image:Crysis_nigger.jpg|130px|thumb|OH LAWD! black person lookin' for sum [[Chicken|chiggins]]!]]

*<b><i>Nomad</i></b> - The character that the player plays as. Like ''[[Halo|Gaylo]]'', the player is never able to see Nomad's face. This is probably because Nomad is too [[fugly]] to be shown in the game. Some [[Fantard|fanboys]] may say that it is because the makers of the game wanted the player to be him, but that is complete bullshit.

*<b><i>Aztec</i></b> - A beaner in the squad who is the first one to die. The pussy actually cries before he dies while talking into the radio.

*<b><i>Mexican</i></b> - A nigga and [[Africa|fellow brother from another mother]] to Prophet. Gets [[rape|raped]] later on in the game and dies.

*<b><i>[[Britfag|Psycho]]</i></b> - Some [[Britain|limey]] who says that he is by your side most of the time. The funny thing is that he NEVER helps you. He even gets his own [[shit|shitty]] game.

*<b><i>[[Bubba|Prophet]]</i></b> - A crazy black person who thinks he can take on the world. Miraculously never dies, but always bitches at Nomad to either hurry up, follow him, go somewhere, or protect him.

==Suit==
The whole game revolves around the damn [[Halo|suit that the player wears]] throughout the whole game. The looks of the suit [[Shit no one cares about|resemble all of the muscles and structure in the body]]. Whenever a feature of the suit is activated, the suit will go, "Maximum [[shit|(insert power here)."]] It is cool the first couple of times, but the comments get irritating after a while. For example, you will be in combat, and multiple powers are needed. So, this is what you will hear, "Maximum armor. Maximum cloak. Maximum armor. Maximum strength. Maximum cloak. Maximum speed. Maximum armor. Maximum speed. Maximum, MAXIMUM, <b>MAXIMUM</b>."

==Weaponry==

[[Image:Aztecdeath.jpg|thumb|Aztec still has all the cum on him from the [[Tentacle rape|monster]] that killed him.]]

<b><u>Weapons</u></b>

*''SOCOM Pistol'' - This little [[Shit|peashooter]] cannot do anything. When fired, the pistol sounds like someone is [[Sex|punching]] a pillow.

*''SCAR'' - The first gun in the game. It quickly runs out of ammo and the only way to get ammo for it is at the very end of the game when it is not even needed. This weapon is [[Truth|completely useless]].

*''FY-71 Assault Rifle'' - A piece of shit gun that resembles the AK-47. Of course the makers of the game didn't want to call it the AK-47 because the game had to be "[[Future|futuristic]]." This is complete bullshit.

*''MPX8 Submachine Gun'' - This gun does not even look like a submachine gun in the game. It looks like a rifle due to how huge it is. The MPX8 is used to [[Cum|spray]] bullets at everything which is why the gun is particularly loved by noobs in multiplayer (even though its a fact that only 10 people play multiplayer).

*''Tactical Shotgun'' -  The only weapon that actually useful in the game. Good to [[lulz|kill dirty koreans]] in the game. Also, it is good for [[Shotgun mouthwash|shotgun mouthwashes]].

*''Precision Rifle (DSG-1)'' - The creators of the game could not just call it a sniper rifle. It had to be called a "precision rifle" since it is the [[Bullshit|most accurate weapon in the game]].

*''Gauss Rifle'' - [[Some argue|Considered]] the most powerful weapon in the game. Ironically, a Gauss gun [[irl]] cannot kill anything and is less powerful than a BB gun. LIES!

*''Hurricane Minigun'' - Great to [[Rainforest|mow down forests]] and [[The man|lay down the law]].

*''Rocket Launcher'' - [[Typical]] rocket launcher. The missiles are laz0r guided, but that sucks because the player will normally [[Dumbass|forget this feature]] and point down to where they are. This creates a virtual [[an hero]] experience when the player dies. [[C-NOTE|They have occasionally been confused with AWPs.]] 

*''TAC Cannon'' - [[Extreme Advertising|Now this motherfuckin' weapon will blow yo shit up. Lock this hot shit on to an enemy and KABOOM, you just popped a huge cap in that gangbanger's ass]]. This weapon is only [[Not|useful]] for the last level in the game (thank [[God]]). It requires a lock on which doesn't even work sometimes and only makes a tiny explosion. Only [[idiots]] like this weapon.

*''C4'' - Great for glitches such as making boats flip out of control. C4 was made to be a pain in the ass in this game since the player has to get up [[Falcon Punch|close and personal]] with it. This creates [[butthurt]].

*''Grenades'' - Randomly throw a bunch of frags around a multiplayer map and see everyone [[Cry|get pissed off]] at you, ultimately causing [[epic lulz]].

<b><u>Weapon Modifications</u></b>

*<i>Reflex Sight</i> - Basically a red dot sight. That is all it is. This is not useful for any weapon in the game.

*<i>Assault Scope</i> - Huge scope that acts just like the reflex sight. Really shitty since it blocks out a lot of the players view.

*<i>Sniper Scope</i> - While aiming, the scope will move around a lot. Great for campfags in multiplayer.

*<i>Laser Pointer</i> - The only good aiming device in the game. The dot is so big on the target that you will be asking why the enemies do not see it.

*<i>Flashlight</i> - Useless since nightvision is built into your suit and everything is well lit ([[Lol wut|even in the night]]).

*<i>Grenade Launcher</i> - Great for going totally [[Insane|apeshit]] all over everyone. You can reenact [[Rage|Rambo]] with this mod. 

*<i>Tactical Attachment</i> - Secondary firing mechanism to shoot darts full of [[Drugs|tranquilizers]] into an enemy. This is useless because the enemy will wake up again once a battle is over which will fuck the player over and cause [[Butthurt|frustration]].

*<i>Silencer</i> - How enemies do not hear the gun firing is beyond anyone that plays this game. The silencer is extremely [[Loud Nigra|loud]].

==Multiplayer==

[[Image:CrysisChoke.jpg|thumb|Yes, you get to choke [[Korean|gooks]] in the game.]]

{{quote|Full multiplayer strategies, including detailed overviews for all gameplay modes, and thorough tactical explorations of each multiplayer map.|[[Lies]] that [[EA]] spreads on their websites.}}

There is a multiplayer option within the game, but when you join a game you are bound to get [[Rape|raped]]. Most people that play multiplayer are "[[Old|normies]]" to it. In other words, they have been playing the game ever since it came out, non-stop, and know everything about it. The game becomes not fun for [[Noob|noobs]] which makes them reside in the game's [[Irc|chatroom]].

One of the extra programs that came with the game is Punkbuster. In a nutshell, this program acts as a [[1984|big brother]], but more [[Retard|retarded]]. Punkbuster was designed to kick hackers out of the game, but instead kicks legitimate players out of the game and [[Germany|<i>enforces</i> hacking]]. Most servers do not have this feature on them anymore due to people not joining the servers. 

Not only does Punkbuster do all of this when the game is installed, it also runs as a background process on the user's computer. Not only does this slow down the computer, but it also allows loopholes for a computer to be completely fucked up and patching in the background! [[Ghey|Wonderful]]!

==Nerd Rage==

[[Image:Crapcrysiscomparison.gif|thumb|[[Retards|People]] actually spent [[Wtf|100s of dollars]] to upgrade their computers for a [[Idiot|minor graphics difference]].]]

Amongst many forums, constant bitching was happening about people trying to overclock their graphics cards and CPUs. Instead of getting great performance, many people's computers blew up, stayed the same, or just could not play the game. 

{{squote|Uninstall your current driver though Control Panel. Reboot into Safe Mode. Download and install this http://www.guru3d.com/category/driversweeper/. Run it and choose to sweep for Nvidia display only. Reboot into normal mode and download and install the latest drivers.|Some people actually went through all of this trouble to play this shitty game.}}

{{squote|But better hardware?

The game magazine Gamereactor stated that this game has the coolest graphics ever, and one of the coolest effects ever seen in a game.

They're playing with a computer you can buy if you pay around 4200 $.|[[Bullshit|OH FUCK YEAH! I'M GOING TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PLAY A SHITTY GAME!!!]]}}

{{squote|put more ram in. [[Buttsecks|ram yo sista]]|[[Wut]]?}}

{{squote|Nice graphics and that's all.Crappy story, no relevant gameplay at all, bla bla bla.
It's one of the most overrated games I've seen in a while.

It's sad that some people found *entertainment* for just been playing with cool graphics.|Someone who is actually [[smart]].}}

{{squote|Turok is better than this shit.| Another person being [[smart]].}}

{{squote|...but can it run Crysis?|You'll see this all over [[Youtube]].}}

==Glitches==

[[Image:Crysis_34.jpg|thumb|right|[[Not gay|Not a glitch.]]]]
