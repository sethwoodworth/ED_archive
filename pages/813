Baiting
Baiting is [[Troll|trolling]] by posting something that is guaranteed to cause trouble, usually a differing opinion or view in a community that's highly polarized (for instance, posting about [[Satanism]] in a [[Christian]] community).

On the [[Internets]], '''baiting''' is similar to [[troll|trolling]], in that baiters, like trolls, try to elicit a response from other users. The difference is that the response is supposed to be embarrassing to the user in question, and humorous to others. Baiters frequently concentrate on groups they do not like, such as [[pedophilia|pedophiles]], [[vegan]]s, [[hippies]], or [[homosexual]]s. What the baiter says does not need to make sense, it is often simply written to baffle the bait, and to produce an interesting result. In that respect, baiting is similar to [[telephone]] prank calls, but often much more elaborate.

Baiting frequently takes place on [[IRC]] or [[instant messaging]]. The [[chat log]]s are then typically posted on the [[internets]].

Some of these pranks have grown into [[Internet phenomena]]. For example, Rich "Lowtax" Kyanka from the popular [[Something Awful]] site engaged in a long [[ICQ]] session (titled "Space Robot Bonanza") where he talked to a gullible user about "space robots" who supposedly "protected" humans from the "terrible secret of space" by pushing them down stairs. This was later turned into a song by The Laziest Men on Mars, with lyrics such as:

: We are the space robots
: We are here to protect you
: We are here to protect you
: From the terrible secret of space

Baiters are sometimes long-time residents of a comment posting arena. They see a newbie visit, and toss a question or comment at some remark the newbie posted. It may be hostile, challenging, aggressive, just to see what the newbie is made of, if he or she has conviction, or knows the subject well.

Thus, baiting can be a sort of "hazing" or humiliation prior to initiation into a posting "club."
