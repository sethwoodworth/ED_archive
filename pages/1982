On May 24, 2010, every [[newfag]] posting to /[[b]]/ on 4chan who forgot to [[lurk moar]] had to add "DUN DUN" to every reply and every post. This is because some retard made the 4chan posting screen to look like a [[TV|Lawl & Hurrdurr]] scene break complete with the fucking [http://images.4chan.org/b/junk/doinkdoink.swf dung dung] sound. Proving once again that most [[cancer]] on /b/ comes from [[m00t]] himself.

[[Image:Dun_dun_is_the_cancer.jpg|thumb|right|DUN DUN = CANCER]]
[[4chan]] mods changed the "post successful" screen to a [[bureaucratic fuck|Law and Order]] themed version, fully equipped with the sound effect, "'''dun dun'''". It instantly became everyone's signature in every post. Shorty after its sudden popularity, people got tired of it. [[shit nobody cares about|There were multiple threads praising as well has hating on the DUN DUN noise.]] As of when Law and Mudskips Order ended the Dun Dun suddenly vanished and peace was brought back into the land. Dun Dun was made by a bunch of faggots who thought that everyone would shit bricks on the "Post Successful" screen. It was only available in the cancer that is /[[b]]/ and only newfags shat their pants. 

So [[profound]] was the response to '''DUN DUN''', that a full 24 hours after it debuted on /[[b]]/, that debate still raged amongst the retards of /[[b]]/ as to whether the sound was '''DUN DUN''', '''DUNG DUNG''', '''DOINK DOINK''' (as the 4chan .swf was labeled) or several dozen other variants on what Wikipedia says (so it must be true) is called '''The Clang'''.

Despite the fact that the date never ever changed from May 24, the dun dun was still being used on /b/ on May 25, ensuring another full day of [[newfag]]s posting threads about, related to, complaining over, or consisting of entirely nothing but DUN DUN or [[reaction face]] threads... plus [[troll]]s trying to trick people into [[post]]ing by claiming the date had finally been changed. Also [[inb4]] newfags can't date().

Opinions over the DUN DUN ranged from most rapid meme elevation ever, to fastest old meme ever, to the new [[cancer]]. Also everyone complained about how the date never changed.

As a result of this boaredwhoreing, there was even a [[Facebook|BookFace]] group created for the DUN DUN. [http://www.facebook.com/pages/DUN-DUN/129163470428245] Since the only common denominator of /b/ and BookFace is faggotry, it had [[over 9000|2837642843]] followers immediately upon being created.

On Wednesday May 26, moot pulled the plug on his Frankenstein's monster, sending '''DUN DUN''' to [[old meme|its grave]] and putting everyone out of their misery; and [[nothing of value was lost]]. However, [[what has been seen]] (and heard) cannot be unseen (or unheard) and [[cancer]]fags are loathe to [[stop posting|let it go]]. As a result of [[stop posting|how long this has been allowed to go on]], when it finally got turned off, there was at least a week of mourning and "[[oldfag]]s remember the dun dun" (because on today's /b/ an oldfag is someone who has been there for 2 hours).

Two weeks before the season finale of 20-year-old cop and lawyer show '''Lawl & Order''', NBC decided to [[permaban|shitcan the series for life]] and didn't tell anyone until the last episode of the season (and -ultimately- series) was already shot and delivered as some random, [[crap|crap]] storyline mostly about how retarded public school teachers and their unions are but was obviously written by newfag [[4chan]] lutkers/teleplay writers who inserted [[EPIC]] in the script over 9 times and a plot device featuring '''moot'''. Naturally, [[cancerfags]] all over 4chan [[shit bricks|shat brix]] and the mods milked them for [[lulz]].

This otherwise forgettable bit was about an [[anonymous]] blogger called [[Rick Benson]] living in his parents' [[basement]] who's threatening to [[Columbine]] an [[NYC]] high school on his blog '''''Moot's Countdown''''' and was pretty much incidental to the main storyline [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/law-order-signs-off-in-the-rubber-room/ about public school "''rubber rooms''"] but ended up being the epilogue to one of the longest running and successful shows in TV history that also spawned everybody's favourite cops v sickfucks drama '''Law & Order: SVU'''. 

[[irony|Ironically]], the final scene was about one of the cop's ongoing struggle with [[cancer]]. In the final moments, Det. Van Buren finds out she is finally cancer free after battling the disease with [[chemo]] for the last few seasons. It would appear that she sent it all over to 4chan.
