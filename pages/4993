Lowter
[[Image:Lowter.jpg|thumb|Lowter. Notice the puke color scheme and total lack of information.]]
[http://www.lowter.com/ Lowter], previously known as Lowter Studios, is an e-zine primarily featuring the pretentious ramblings of Ethan Poole, a [[gay]] [[Apple]]-loving hackish [http://www.lowter.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=1052 fanboy], and his merry troupe of [[13-year-old boy | 13 year old]] [[fag]] euro-freaks playing make-believe as experienced web developers. It features [[at least 100]] poorly-written and inaccurate [[Shit_nobody_cares_about | PHP, Javascript and Perl tutorials]]. Lowter prides itself in its "Too Easy Guides," the title of which, contrary to Ethan's self-proclaimed knowingness of [[nothing | teh Englishes]], makes absolutely no grammatical sense whatsoever. The Lowter forums' only purpose is to serve as an outlet for Ethan's [[Libertarian]], [[Pagan]], and [[emo]]  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ethan_lowter] whinings about how his  [http://ethan.lowter.us/2006/08/15/i-hate-english English teacher doesn't like him] for being a pretentious fuck. The scientific community, after numerous studies, has concluded that Lowter contains no useful information whatsoever and Ethan should have stuck with his [http://ethan.lowter.us/2006/07/09/i-am-doing-something-with-my-life Charmed RPG] site. Lowter is a known sect of the [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Liberal_%28community%29 "Blame America First"] crowd.

== Ottoman == 

[[Image:Ottoman_useless.gif#fileâ€Ž|thumb|Ottoman, once again proving the stupidity of mankind.]]
One day, while [[circle jerk | circle-jerking]], Ethan came up with an idea for an insanely simplistic content management system. An hour later, the final version of [http://www.lowter.com/p/ottoman/ Ottoman] was completed. Having been coded by a drug-using [[moron]], Ottoman claims to give "you the power!" by doing absolutely [[nothing]] on its own. Its tag line:

"Unlike other content management systems, Ottoman puts the power in your hands. Ottoman does no rendering itself of your content, but using designed commands you can render information exactly to your preference. By not rendering content itself, Ottoman gives you more control, while saving you disk space at the same time."

Translated out of [[bullshit]] speak, this says:

"Our software cannot do anything at all, so we are going to claim that its inability to complete even basic tasks is a feature! Now write gleaming reports and suck our cocks, critics!"

[[Image:ethan_copy.jpg|thumb|Ethan has many flaws, and a bad case of the [[Internet Disease]].]]
Ethan fancies himself to be a [[Europe | European]], probably to [[You Don't Have Any Friends | fit in]] with his aforementioned euro-freak friends, although [[Madonna]] is more European than Ethan was, is, and ever will be. In order to appear more European, Ethan [http://ethan.lowter.us/2006/08/24/standing-out-in-america-101#c000114 criticizes] his fellow [[Americans]], calling them stupid, fat bastards who know nothing of the rest of the world. He also insists on using SI units, spelling color with a 'u' and riding in Lorrys, not trucks. Ethan loves to write first drafts of things in another language[http://ethan.lowter.us/2006/08/24/standing-out-in-america-101], namely Swedish, because English is for retards and the [[Sarcasm | low, '' low down-time '']] of his Macs allow him with near-limitless free time in which to pointlessly translate everything to and from his [[ghey]] selection of languages.

Ethan hails from the sunny, [[lemonparty | lemon-infested]] land of [[Florida]].

[http://www.gizone.co.uk/ Lotrgamemast] is Lowter's second-in-command, the literal definition of euro-freak, and the number one fan of sucking Ethan's [[E-penis]]. His writing is filled with as [[swearing | much swearing as humanly possible]], along with common emo whining and, although currently a Windows user, a true, [[homosexual | healthy]] [http://www.gizone.co.uk/?p=44 sexual attraction] to the [[ass | USB]] ports of a supple, young [[twink | iMac]]. This entry into his blog sums up his intelligence rather well:

"''From about half and hours testing i found that it was getting a singal but bot turning on.''"

If England had a [[confederate]], [[racist]], illiterate South, lotrgamemast would live there.
