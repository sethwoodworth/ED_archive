{{tinyquote|This year, I went about right. If anyone was [[offended]], then I don't care.}}
'''Ricky Gervais''' is an [[unfunny]], [[atheist]], [[britfag]] comedian most notable for the [[Lie|far superior]] UK version of ''The Office''. Recently, he was selected to host the Golden Globes on January 16, 2011; those second-rate awards given by some journalists in exchange for publicity and all-paid trips to [[Las Vegas]]. Then, Gervais proceeded to troll [[Hollywood]] so hard that it may have ended his career. Ordinarily, poking fun at Hollywood is an acceptable practice, but for some reason it wasn't OK this time. This may be another example of the [[Scientology|cancer that is killing cinema]].

Hollywood, being the [[thin skin]]ned bunch of [[Jews]] that they are, got extremely [[butthurt]] when Gervais made some slightly offensive jokes at their expense. He took down [[scientologist]] [[Tom Cruise|John Travolta]] for being the cock sucking [[faggot]] that he is; the marketing team of Sex in the City for grossly airbrushing the movie poster to the point of making them look like they belong on the cast of [[Snooki|Jersey Shore]]; Charlie Sheen for being a [[truth|womanizing alcoholic]]; [[Mel Gibson]] for hating sanity and [[Jews|those filthy kikes]]; and just about everyone else for being a bunch of doped up closeted drug addicts. [[Fact|All of which happens to be true]], it's amazing how some in the audience took it as a slight and felt [[Chocolate Rain|shit on]]. But what they don't realize is when you're a filthy buttfucker who's covered in shit most the time anyways, it really doesn't matter does it?

Gervais systematically took down the Zionists a peg or two and for that he is a truly great [[troll]]. Here is the master in all his glory:

{{quote|Certainly, in this case, he pushed the envelope and occasionally went too far. The HFPA would never condone some of his personal remarks. Overall, however, the show was among the best we’ve ever had and we were pleased.|The Hollywood Foreign Press}}
{{quote|He definitely crossed the line. And some of the things were totally unacceptable. But that's Ricky.}}
{{quote|Ricky will not be invited back to host the show next year, for sure...For sure any movie he makes he can forget about getting nominated. He humiliated the organization last night and went too far with several celebrities whose representatives have already called to complain.}}
{{quote|Aside from the fact that it's been hugely mean-spirited with mildly sinister undertones, I'd say the vibe of the show has been pretty good so far, wouldn't you?|Robert Downey Jr.|on being a butthurt crackhead}}

While most would think the [[lulz]] had at the expense of [[Scientologists|Hollywood's Elite]] would soon to be forgotten, the bowl of shit was stirred by Judd Apatow's diminutive [[dick|plunger]]. Judd Apatow is best known for making films where creepy [[neckbeard]] [[basement dwellers]] somehow hook up with hot wimmenz for being a [[nice guy]] in spite of their lazy, selfish natures and [[Asperger's syndrome|stunted social skills]].  While [[loser|many]] find his movies humorous (moar leik [[cancer|tumor-ous!]] [[amirite]]?), this stupid greasy fuck shows a disturbing lack of understanding the concept of [[satire]]. While he was hosting the Producers Guild Awards ([[ALL CAPS|ANOTHER FUCKING AWARDS SHOW??? FFS]]) he came to the defense of the [[Rich|poor]] and [[Bullshit|defenseless]] celebrities such as [[trap|Cher]], [[Lemon Party|Hugh Hefner]], [[unfunny|Tim Allen]], [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Drugs|Robert Downey, Jr]]. <br>[[Fact|It's sad when you can't laugh at yourself]], or [[Christian|turn the other cheek]]. But since these tortured souls have such rough lives, we can understand their [[butthurt|suffering]], can't we?
