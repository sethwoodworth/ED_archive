Creation
'''Where did all this shit come from?'''
[[Image:Hello.jpg|Thumb|right|A creationist doing what he does best]]
This question has plagued mankind for [[at least 100 years]]. Knowing that the truth would have far fewer [[lulz]] than complete [[crap]], [[God]] and his homeboys hunkered down in the studio to create "The [[Bible]]": it was only too late that G and the 'Postles realized just what a monster they had created... Producer [[Al Gore]] can still only shake his head in disbelief.

'''Genesis'''

The first gangsta' rap off the multi-platinum offering featured a bunch of white guys (pictured above) to provide a hard metal riff backing to God's deep bass spit. This track prominently features G's erotic interpretation of how the [[InterWeb]] came to be:

''"And on da eighf day I made tha [[internets]],''

''For da' hoes in the house to start show'n dem tits,''

''Ridin' like a G on dem PC wires,''

''Never thought it would start all these [[flame war]] fires;''

''So a black person make a scene and looked down and said,''

''[[WTF]] brotha' man, what the helluv I made?"''

'''Drama'''

With the creation of the [[internets]], the artist formerly known as [[prince]] of princes now had a daunting task before him: how to keep this cash money flowin' and [[pwn]] those backstabbing [[Jews]]. With the help of his prodigy, The Holy Ghost, he developed the smash-hit, ''[[drama]]''. To this day, sucka MC's can't step to him and those caught up in the success of "The [[Bible]]" use "[[drama]]" in conjunction with their [[fantasy]] that the lyrical sex, drugs and rap romp is a factual account of human creation. They use it, coupled with the [[fanfiction]] portion of the [[Bible]] "The New Testament", to [[flame]] [[Jews]], [[gays]], and [[furries]]. Even now, [[God]] looks down at his creation, and seeing the [[lulz]], smiles and laughs like the [[sick fuck]] he is.
