'''Seanbaby''' is a B-rated [[internet celebrity]]. Seanbaby is like a clone of [[Maddox]] merged with a Mountain Dew commercial. Both have a semi-funny website, both sites haven't been [[at least 100|updated in forever]], both have recently tried to break into legitimate writing, and both have [[fag]]gy haircuts. More importantly than his haircut is his black person girl friend, whom he captured from his initial landing point in Africa.

==Background==
Seanbaby, a well-known [[internet celebrity]] is one of several Moonchildren who crashed on earth 13 years ago after their cryogenic pods were released by the Moonwomb in the hopes that someday her offspring would carry on the family line on other planets. 

After morphing into his humanoid form, which unfortunately still carries alien characteristics such as multicolored hair (which is very [[Lie|anti-establishment]]) and elongated and permanently extended middle fingers, Seanbaby did what all extra-terrestrials do first to blend in with human society: set up a [[website]].

Sadly, Seanbaby's website has gone without update for years. We can only assume he has flown back to the Moon as his Moonmother's chosen incestual-by-necessity re-mate; or he died after being hit by a water balloon, which really does work on aliens, because [[Invader Zim|Jhonen Vasquez]] said so.

He was a writer for a [[gay|bay area]] magazine called [http://www.thewavemag.com The Wave] for a few years.

Seanbaby has also been spotted on 1up's [http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3158497 Broken Pixels] show, where he sits on a couch with two other guys and has hot mansex while playing shitty videogames.

As of 2009, Seanbaby is writing for [http://www.cracked.com Cracked.com].  He's still repeating the same old tired [[unfunny]] [[crap]] that he's been putting out for his entire [[internets]] [[fail|career]].

==The Website==

Seanbaby's site basically consists of four sections: Stupid scenes from comic books; reviews of old, [[video Game Reviewers|shitty video games]]; some [[shit]] about Hostess pies; and Colonel Artemis's Ragtime Revue.

There's also lots of ads for [[pr0n]] and [[Suicide Girls]].

==EGM==

[[At least 100]] issues ago, when Electronic Gaming Monthly did another one of those stupid "100 greatest games" lists, they had Seanbaby write a "20 worst video games" column. Amazingly, Seanbaby managed to buck the trend of his website and deliver [[teh]] [[lulz]], leading the editors of EGM to offer Seanbaby a job reviewing shitty games. This was funny as well, the first couple of times. Unfortunately, they can all be reduced to a Mad-Lib:

:<nowiki>[Game] is a piece of shit. Seriously, [game maker] should kill themselves for making this game. I would rather [humorous hyperbole involving bodily injury] than play [game]. If I ever find the head of [game maker], I will force him to listen to [shitty new wave band] for [period of time], then [second humorous hyperbole involving bodily injury]. Phil Collins.</nowiki>

He also enjoys taking pictures of himself feeling up booth babes at E3 and flipping off the camera, [[No|which is radical, dude!]]
