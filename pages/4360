'''Joel Ivory''', AKA [[Furry|Elnaria]], [[Otherkin|Xeravyn]], [[Weaboo|Colineth]] and/or [[Asking for it|Incit3r]] is a 21 - year - old [[SCA]]dian [[Australia]]n with a severe case of [[unwarranted self importance]]. Joining the [[SCA]] in order to one day become a [[FYIAD|dragon]], '''Joel''' soon found that the life of the [[troll|fighter]] was [[pwned|not for him.]]

Next up for Joel was [[Sex|scoring]] hot [[women]], since according to popular myth SCA also stands for "Society for [http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/Northeast/11/12/abuse.sleepovers.ap/ Consenting Adults]. In order to score, Joel went and picked the [[sarcasm|easiest target]]; said target being an ''antisocial'' young ''lesbian'' in a ''relationship'' with ''Yirimyah''.

Annoyed at his complete [[Virgin|failure to have sex]] with said [[lesbian]], Joel proceeded to try to ruin Yirimyah. This did not go so well. Joel proceeded to not turn up to SCA events, citing fear of counter-ruin.

As '''Incit3r''', Joel then attacked an [http://nyx-panda.livejournal.com/149563.html anon comment lj post], informing the [[troll|users]] that they had been ''"shelved by Lord Xeravyn the Incit3r."'' OH BURN. This was posted anonymously, so was rapidly followed up by a [[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]] and some [[George Zimmer]]. Upon doxing the newcomer, Yirimyah found that Incit3r was Joel: an IRL faggot in addition to an online one. TL;DR version: Dox dropped, lulz had, Incit3r pwned.

 HI, I'M INCIT3R, FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE YOUNG BOY'S SEX CLUB.
 LAST WEEK I WOKE UP TO FIND A LUSCIOUS LABILE LAD STRADDLING MY MAGNIFICENT MEGA-ORGAN. MERELY SEEING THE YOUTH UPON MY DECA-DIMENSIONAL 
 DESTROYER-DONG FORCED ME TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION. TEARING HIS FINE SUIT FROM HIS SLIM SEXY LIMBS, I PROCEEDED TO BURY MY BUTT-DESTROYER 
 DEEP WITHIN HIS BOWEL. HIS SCREAMS FOR MERCY WENT UNHEARD UNTILL I RAPACIOUSLY RUPTURED HIS COLON WITH GALLONS OF MAN-PAINT. 
 FURTHERMORE, I PROCEEDED TO RAPE ALL OF HIS FAMILY UNTILL THEY BROKE IN TWO, UNABLE TO ACCOMODATE MY ELEPHANTINE GOD-COCK.
 I'M INCIT3R, AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE HOW THEY LOOKED.
 I GUARANTEE IT.

==Poetry==
<i>Beautiful; Hot; Attractive; Cute<br>
By all these labels have I been known<br>
But nobody sees; no, not a one of you see<br>
That I weep because I'm so alone<br>
I am always complimented and admired wherever I go<br>
From catcalls to poems epic; And in these things I *do* take pride<br>
For my beauty is - humbly - without compare; assuredly a worthwhile prize<br>
But in the end, to me this means naught, for on its own it is a superficial lie<br>
For all these reflect is mens' shallow desire and naked greed<br>
And from the other women? Worse; they reek of jealousy<br>
For I've a slim waist, perfect face, and a rear stared at gratuitously</i><br>
PLEASE NOTE: JOEL HEREIN ADMITS THAT HE WISHES HE WAS FEMALE<br>

==Testimonial from other users:==
 '''Nymph''': God I fucking hate Joel. he's the one who started making moves on my girlfriend.
 '''Nymph''': Are we talking about the same Joel here?
 '''Nymph''': Faggot homeless queenslander jumps in, starts passing judgement on everyone
                 and anyone and makes passes at girlfriends of scadians with no success.
 '''Nymph''': About six-one, 200 pounds, face that looks like a westie
                 only with more teeth, blond hair, a tortured soul with a tragic past, indistinguishable
                 from a 16 year old boy if only for the inescapable fact that he is a 21 year old boy.
 '''Nymph''': Pleasures in life include turning up to SCA meetings for no fucking reason, being
                 homeless and having life-changing epiphanies in close
                 proximity to hot girls.
 <yiri> yeah
 '''Nymph''': The significance and weight of these epiphanies directly proportional to the 
                significance and weight of his 2" erection.
 <yiri> that's the one
 '''Nymph''': That closet-emo, self-pitying, useless, attempted-girlfriend-thief, 
                tortured-soul-only-with-less-eloquence, self-important, judgemental little prick has about 
                enough intelligence to cover only half a fly's cognitive function.
 '''Nymph''': But with enough raw bullshit to fill an entire government. Or an emo band.
 <yiri> i am adding this to the article y/n
 '''Nymph''': y.
 '''Nymph''': I mean for the love of all that's good and holy would he stop intruding his fucking 
                obnoxious beak, which in size and taste looks much more like a pelican's bill or the gaping
                 fucking caldera of Mt Doom into shit that just isn't his business yet?
 '''Nymph''': He's known us all for about a month and suddenly in his 21 year old wisdom he's decided
                 that he's got us all figured out.
 <yiri> str8
 '''Nymph''': His only authority on the point is that members of his family became an hero and thus
                 aged him to the point where he's the manifest love-child of Socrates and Freud.
 '''Nymph''': I think he and I would be ok friends, or at least acquaintances, if he a) would stop
                 blatantly trying to get my girlfriend to fuck him and b) actually bothered to do me the great
                 honour of being acquainted with His Holiness the Dalai Emo.
== Departure from civilization ==
[[Image:Xeravyn.jpg|thumb|I'm not even lying. That's his Facebook name.]]
Joel, having consistently failed to [[Sex|score]] hot [[women]] and, by contrast, succeeded in causing everyone who ever even heard him speak to think he's a [[faggot]] and urge him to [[An Hero|take a long walk off a short cliff]], decided it would be best to move back to [[shithole|Brisbane]].

To this, we can all say good riddance to your [[unwarranted self-importance]] and we wish you the best of luck in finally getting laid, although we hope that you don't pollute the gene pool in the process.
