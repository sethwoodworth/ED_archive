'''''Animal Crossing''''' is one of shittiest games on the planet. It was designed by a team of [[furry|furries]] who were [[irl]] ridiculed, and therefore decided to make a little [[MySpace|virtual community]] where they could chat and not get their ass kicked for showing their faces in public. 

As this so-called "[[video game]]" neared completion, the [[internet]] was making its way out of the  uterus, and the team of furries realized there were other furries who were also getting ridiculed around the world. So it was decided to release the game to everyone; it was originally going to be online, but fortunately Nintendo knew what would happen if [[hell|furries could all band together]], so [[b&]] it.

In the game, [[furry|furries]] talk to other furries, aka a furfag community. Due to a high amount of furries, which thankfully is a lot less now thanks to [[W]], this exploded with the release of the second ''Animal Crossing'' game, ''Wild World''. The name implies that there will be plenty of hot animal porn. There was also an online mode, in which furries show off their new hats and clothing in [[trying too hard|an attempt to be erotic]], and stand on both sides of animals to do emotion signs that make it look like they're gangbanging the neighbor [[Republican|elephant]]. 


Many normal people have been turned [[closet furry|furr-curious]] as a result of those [[gay|strangely arousing]], flat-chested anthropomorphic ragamuffins. Fortunately, the unexpected increase in the [[furry]] population was cut short when [[George Bush]] banned foreign trade in 2003.

The [[shit nobody cares about|third ''Animal Crossing'']] game was released in 2008.

Yes, it has its own forums in the asshole of the interwebs. All the people there are either furries, trolls, pedophiles, niggers, or faggots; but they aren't allowed to admit it due to the Communist rules that prevent everything lulzy from flaming/trolling to saying the word "[[you|Freak]]". [[Faggotry|You're not even allowed to link to YouTube]] (You'll get banned in a second if you do).[[Weaboo]]s, and No0bs. 

The mods are the most lulziest out there, and some have even banned themselves by accident (srsly). The people on that site can be categorized easily into one of five areas. Furries, Mods, the mods bitches who report and donate for that star next to their name (blowjob anyone?), faggots, and azns. 80% of the people there don't even play ''Animal Crossing'' anymore/have never played it in their life, but have become soft and decided to hide in the website for fear of sites like [[4chan]] and this one (If anyone linked to a site like this [[butthurt|they'd be banhammered anyways]]). If any of them ever saw something like [[Goatse]], they would probably become [[an hero|an hero]] as quickly as possible (unless Bob the Cat was doing Goatse, then they would fap to it). 

Most people on there are people who are in fear of the word damn and hell (they even put OMG into the filter due to "[[censorship|religious reasons]]"). Many mods live there as well who are constantly breathing down your neck waiting for you to screw up. For instance if a [[loli|girl]] post a fanfic that has the title "CRITISIZMZ WANTED!!!!!111one" and you typed "It could be better but its okay", then the author,mods,newbies,and several others would come crashing down upon you like a H-bomb on Hiroshima (However instead of dying in a horrible fiery inferno you'll get the [[banhammer]]). Despite it being a shitty [[Jews|Kidz-only]] site, mods here are just as arrogant as they are on any other site. OH NOES. They implanted [[gay|flood control]]. Currently, the most known 1337 [[hacker|h4x0rs]] are [[hentai|ACFan192]] and [[Gay|Nintendrew101]]. LULZ.

Oh noes! They now have a [http://www.facebook.com/animalcrossingcommunity/ FaceBook] page! The irony of this is that two weeks before the account was made, the word Facebook was banned on the website. Many believe a raid from one Anon was inspired by this, but they fail to realize that the account was created long before.

In fact, there are ''three'' ''Animal Crossing'' communities like this: [http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/ ACC], [http://axaforums.com/ AXA], and [http://nookipedia.com/forum/ Nookipedia BBS]. However, all are equally shitty as AXA is really unpopular but had [[nerd|smart people]], which eventually got ran out by an influx of [[weeaboos]], while ACC is more popular but has [[retards|people who have no idea how to spell,read,write,eat,sleep,or find a game that is worth buying]] instead of fapping to Bob holding a [[dildo|fishing rod]].


===Exchanging Friend Codes===

Getting in somebody's town through Animal Crossing Community is the worst choice ever. It's nearly impossible. First off you're not aloud to just post friend codes in the public where people can see (Lol another way to get banhammered), they set up a friend code system themselves so it helps "protect people's towns from massacre". The friend code system works by requesting to exchange friend codes with someone else via the button on their profile, and once they approve both of your friend codes will be revealed only to each other. After seeing somebody's town you get to write a 1 star review about how unfun, unfamily friendly and disrespectful their shithole was. You're thinking "Not that bad" right? I mean, how hard is it to not fuck up a simple friend code system? WRONG! Setting up this system is just as much of a bitch as finding people to meet up with. Here's how it works:

*<b>Step 1</b>- Instead of clicking on the friend codes button, you have to look for the map button and create a little map on their stupid map creating feature (Because that's totally obvious.)
*<b>Step 2</b>- Save it then click create a character, put your name, town's name, and friend code on it.
*<b>Step 3</b>- Save it then go back to your map and attach it with the drop down menu.
*<b>Step 4</b>- Add town to your profile.

After going through that totally unnecessary shit you're ready to ask to visit people's towns. Start sending 20 requests an hour because usually only about 3 of 20 people actually read them. Most people will disapprove and after wards pm you saying {{quote|Im lyke SOOOO sorry id luv 4 u to visit but you dunt have enuff REVIEWS on your profile after u get like 100 moar 5 starz and 20 moar reviews saying how much of an ass kisser u r then u may visit mah town!!!! <333|I dare you to go on there and see how much of this you get}} that or {{quote|<s>OMG</s> so sorreh you cunt visit me becus you have a lot of good reviews u got 100 BUT I see a 3 star review on page 2 so im sorry but u gotta get 50 more 5 star reviews and maybe ill reconsider!|Somebody who needs to chill}}

But what are these losers on ACC so worried about? Which brings us to...

===Seeders===

One day a few basement dwellers posing as hackers (Who in reality are too stupid to actually hack so they just use a cheating device for the DS called the Action Replay) discovered a way to destroy people's Animal Crossing: Wild World copies. It was a seeding cheat that was originally intended for placing trees, buildings, rocks, and other shit into their town for personal convenience. The little cheaters found out that they could use these "seeds" online to place in other peoples towns in awkward places such as on a spot right on the town gate. Once the game was saved, the owner of the town could [[BAWWWWW]] in butthurt as their game turned completely black screen and could no longer get pass the Nintendo logo when first turning it on, AKA bricked. 

Seeders soon began making little seeding gangs dedicated to seed everyone's town that wasn't involved in it. [[Loser|What a fun thing to do on a Friday night!]] Every ACWW owner (especially Animal Crossing Community) wept, shook in their boots, and ran to their nearest hugbox for help on how to prevent this. Their solution was making their town <s>OMG</s> as safe as possible by letting only the ass-kissiest, most innocent popular little 12 year olds in and forcing every newbie to work for reviews as slaves. Some also tried being whiteknights and created lol [[Unwarranted self-importance|anti-seeding clubs]].

===They're back...===

T3h Crookz were a well known seeding gang for quite awhile but [[fail|disbanded]] years ago. Note the gangster music.

===No Moar Seeding?===

''Animal Crossing'' for Wii moved the building locations to a separate part of memory from "trash lying about", and seeders realized they couldn't use the action replay [[BAWWWWW|anymore]]. This left the good guys winning this round no thanks to [[whiteknight|them]] and the n00b hackers ending up the ones butthurt. It's been rumored that to this very day there are real hackers still trying to create seeds to ruin this game, but for now nothing has been exposed. It might even stay that way. However, considering it's been proven in the past that basement dwellers have been this low and how stupid Nintendo can really be, [[demotivator|don't count on it]].

==Tom Nook==
[[Image:Tomnookrape.png|thumb|right| What happens when you don't pay your mortgage.]]

Tom Nook is a black person who runs the local mafia and can also be seen in your house watching you [[fap]]. You can earn money by selling [[Drugs|things]] to Nook, unless you want to be a [[hobo]], although it's not advised by [[Nintendo]] as you've got to compete with hobo [[hobo|Joan the fucking pig creature]] or [[drug|Pascal the stoned hippy otter]].

At the beginning of the game Tom Nook makes you his personal black person forcing you to do landscaping for his [[shit]]ty shop, giving him [[blow job]]s and [[b/tard|performing tasks which require you to run around in circles for an hour]].             

In his last "shop" upgrade Tom summons two other [[Hitler|Nazi]] raccoons, which he uses for pissing you off constantly while you [[Theft|shoplift]]. Tom Nook likes to keep you in debt by making your house bigger every time you pay off your mortgage (If you pay him 14,136 bells and give him a [[blowjob]] he'll even install a KFC to satisfy all your black person needs!). Try to hop town when you're working for Nook? Bad idea. [[srsly]] folks, there's no escape from the clutches of this [[Pokemon|gangster raccoon]]. Tom Nook's first words to you? "bitch, plz".

==Mr. Resetti==
Mr. Resetti is a complete [[ass|asshole]] who will flip dick at you for shutting down or restarting the [[game]] without saving. He usually just ends up yelling at you, but if you turn off the game without saving too many times he shoves a pick-axe up your ass and smacks you around for two minutes while all you can do is watch. On rare occasions however you may be visited by his brother Don who will do one of three things: Talk about his brother, show you pictures of his [[cock]], or if you're lucky shove his head up your ass (as you can see the Resetti family has [[rape|an abnormal attraction to putting things in your ass]]).


==Crazy Redd==
Crazy Redd is a conniving little bitch that will charge you a lot of bells for his [[drugs|fake paintings]] and ugly furniture. He is also wanted by the police for selling this stuff, and also known for killing poor victims that won't become his [[hooker|cousin]]... Oh yeah and he works for Satan.

[[File:Animal Crossing fucking the Sable sisters.jpg|thumb|right|Why you should always visit and talk to the Sable sisters.]]

That's right, this [[furry]] little bastard right here, this little fucker's caused me so much trouble,
So yeah, one day, I hopped on the train to 'fuckin nowheresville, and this fucking cat starts goddamn talking to me, that's right, a talking goddamn motherfucking cat, seemed normal enough, started asking questions about stupid shit like "Are you a [[girl]]?", I mean motherfuckin' seriously, do I look like a fuckin' goddamn [[woman]]? No, I motherfuckin' don't, so we had a nice fucking pleasant talk, he moved over and talked on goddamn the phone, I was glad that furry little motherfucker was gone at least for a minute, I was sick of hearing that fucking terrible robotic goddamn voice, fucking douchebag.

Anyways, I got off the train a few hours later, and this goddamn raccoon motherfucker jumps out of fucking nowhere, saying that I bought a house, what the fuck man, I'm like a little kid, I shouldn't be goddamn motherfucking worrying about stupid fucking responsi-fucking-bilities like that [[shit]], so he showed me the fucking house, went [[Sex|inside]], and god-fucking damn that house sucked, it was dusty and small, and all it had was a fucking box and radio, fuck. So I asked the [[furry]] bastard how much for the goddamn house, he said it would be about 10 grand.

That's right, motherfucking ten fucking grand, how the fuck am I suppose to goddamn afford that shit? So he said "YOU CAN WORK PART TIME IN MY MOTHERFUCKING SHOP" and I was like, fine you douchebag. So I went to the freaking shop and what do you know, it's got spiderwebs, fucking hate spiders. Goddamn, I have a fucking sarcastic [[furry]] male [[boxxy]] as my goddamn landlord, fucking fucker assholes. [[Pedo|So the first motherfucking thing he asked me to do is change in the goddamn store, no changing rooms or fucking privacy]], motherfucking ass balls.

So I wore the uniform which looked like it had a goddamn leaf that some asshole took a bite out of. I had to plant [[shit]] outside of the goddamn store, no big fucking deal, [[China|he doesn't seem to understand the goddamn child labor laws]], gonna fucking sue his ass when I can afford a goddamn fucking phone. So then he asks me to talk to everyone in town, FUCK THAT SHIT, I did it anyway.

Anyways, after many [[fap|repetitive tasks]], I had finally paid off the goddamn house.. OR DID I? Fucking shit. I have to pay about a fucking million more bells for the goddamn motherfucking house. That furry little bastard. I don't even remember buying a fucking house, fucking shit.
