As he thrusts, his ostensibly impossibly long cock comes ''out'' through her mouth with the first thrust, then out each of her nostrils on the second and third before looping back.

She doesn't look like she's having a good time. Might be more distressing if it wasn't so unrealistic.

'''Lyrics sampled''' : I'm your boogieman / That's what I am / I'm here to do whatever I can

'''Description''' : A clip of a once beautiful girl who was immolated after her car was struck by a drunk driver in an SUV. He got away without any problems, but she was trapped in her car which caught fire. 

She holds up a portrait of her before the accident, then pulls it down to show her face after being mostly destroyed by third-degree burns followed by extensive plastic surgery. She is blind in one eye, has almost no nose and no ears. She has no hair and very little to distinguish her face in general. In fact, she's been named as a possible face-transplant candidate. 

She actually tries to look her best in that picture, wearing a hat and with one hand taped up to cover up a lot of the damage that was done. Her name is Jacqueline Saburido and her image has been used extensively in anti-drunk driving campaigns; more [[Wikipedia:Jacqui_Saburido|here]].

[[Wikipedia:I'm Your Boogie Man|The song]], which won White Zombie a 1996 Grammy for ''Best Metal Performance'', is actually a cover of the 1977 chart-topping single ''I'm Your Boogie Man'' by KC And The Sunshine Band. Rob Zombie is the vocalist.

[[Wikipedia:Bitches Ain't Shit|Bitches Ain't Shit]] was a bonus track off Dr. Dre's legendary album ''[[Wikipedia:The Chronic|The Chronic]]'' (1992).

It came into notoriety within the more mainstream community when Ben Folds (former frontman of the ''Ben Folds Five'') released a Bitches Ain't Shit cover (2005) that reached #71 on the ''Billboard Hot 100''.

'''Audio''' : Rob Zombie - Living Dead Girl

'''Lyrics sampled''' : ''pending''

'''Description''' : The woman in this video is [[Wikipedia:Terri Schiavo|Terri Schiavo]] who was at the center of a highly controversial case involving euthanasia. 

In 1990, she suffered a cardiac arrest, probably as a result of bulimia-induced hypokalemia (low potassium levels). Because her brain was deprived of oxygen so long, she was left with severe, irreversible brain damage and diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state. 

In 1998, her husband petitioned the local Circuit Court to have her feeding tube removed. After a protracted legal battle between her husband and her parents, in which US Congressional Republicans, Florida Governor Jeb Bush and even US President George W Bush became involved (and was ultimately determined by the federal court system), the husband's wishes ultimately prevailed. 

After 15 years (not soon enough!) she was finally allowed to die; her feeding tube was removed on 27 March 2005. She died four days later.

The title of the page refers to the fact that the "Dildo Demon" looks an awful lot like the fake monsters in the TV series ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers''.

'''Lyrics sampled''' : ''pending''

'''Description''' : A clip from the Mr. T cartoon where a bunch of white guys are twirling on cars and break dancing in the street. The song is best known from the movie ''Office Space'', where it plays during the scene when the three main characters destroy their poorly-functioning printer. The page title is a technology meme that was also referenced in ''Office Space''. From [[Wikipedia:PC LOAD LETTER|its Wikipedia page]]:

:''The phrase is a long standing joke and cause for confusion for computer users because most users could not (and still cannot) decipher its meaning. The term was popularized by the comedy cult film Office Space. Michael Bolton (David Herman), one of the three main characters, reads the error message from the VFD status display on a fax machine, after which he asks, "'PC Load Letter'? What the fuck does that mean?" This message appeared on the display just after Bolton filled the printer's cassette with blank paper. Frustrations such as this led the main characters of the film to take revenge on the malfunctioning printer by destroying it in a vacant field with a baseball bat.''

'''Description''' : A Japanese guy has a seizure during the credits of a movie. [Anyone know what movie?] Really funny. 

The title is a reference to the Simpsons episode ''[[Wikipedia|Thirty Minutes over Tokyo|Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]]'', where the entire Simpson family (except Homer, but he plays along) suffers seizures after watching the fake Japanese TV show ''Battling Seizure Robots''. 

This, in turn, is a reference to the infamous ability of certain Japanese TV shows, video games, etc. that show bright, rapidly flashing (stroboscopic) lights to induce seizures in susceptible individuals, i.e. people with [[Wikipedia:Photosensitive epilepsy|photosensitive epilepsy]]. About 1 in 4000 children suffer from some kind of photosensitive epilepsy.

One of the most infamous triggers was [[Wikipedia:Denn%C5%8D Senshi Porygon|a 1997 Pokémon episode]], where a scene depicting a stroboscopic (12 Hz) blue/red flashing resulted in the hospitalization of 685 children (though few actually were diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy) and some symptoms reported in an estimated 5-10% of the viewing population. The even funnier part - when the clip was shown on news programs covering the story, still more people suffered symptoms.

For what it's worth, watching the episode in high quality gave me a headache and made me feel a little nauseous, lightheaded and even a bit dissociative, though watching it in lower quality didn't do much. The episode is ''Dennou Senshi Porigon'', or "Electric Soldier Porygon" (S1E38). The episode has not been aired outside Japan. You can find it using your favorite torrent client (hint: find Season 1 of the series and use a client that allows you to pick and choose which files in a torrent to download). Or check out the scene on [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3pCTmYieWk You Tube]. That one comes with a handy disclaimer!

And [http://www.youtube.com/user/seizures4you#p/a/u/1/ez3CtVLxguY this one] repeats the seizure process over and over for handy pocket seizures!

'''Description''' : Some guy bound up in leather restraints and having his anus fristed (fisted past the wrist... and down to the elbow, in this case) by another guy. "Baby, slide down that pole!"

The music was originally from the flash video ''[http://www.sickanimation.com/imagesandflash/coolcourtweb.swf Cool Court: Starring Nachos The Crosseyed Cat]'' by Marc M of [http://www.sickanimation.com Sickanimation.com]. The Pop-n-Loc-ness monster wins his case in Cool Court and immediately breaks it down. A higher quality version of the song can be found on Marc's CD (The Ultimate Party Collection, Vol. 1).

'''Description''' : A guy mouth-fucking a big dead fish with a girl masturbating in the background. Not sure what kind - looks sort of like a wide-mouth bass. Really unpleasant.

The title refers to the idea that vaginal secretions smell fishy; thus this person's female partner might (as described in the song) interpret his dick smelling like fish as evidence of him cheating on her.

The alligator bites down and the two roll end-over-end as the kid tries to pull his arm out. Morbidly funny. If you watch what happens to his arm carefully, it bends and twists in ways that arms are not intended to. 

The song itself, coupled to a video of a crocodile (or is it an alligator?) prowling about has become a {{youtube|XnMDrv8Mx3E|YouTube meme}}.

'''Description''' : Really buff Japanese chick riding a dick while simultaneously doing bicep curls.

The page title is probably a reference to the ''American Psycho'' quote, "My mask of sanity is about to slip" (Patrick Bateman). This quote, in turn, has been quoted in other media (e.g. the song ''Suicidal Failure'' by Cage). The full quote: 

''I have all the characteristics of a human being: blood, flesh, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why. My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.''

'''Description''' : A guy at a gas station just minding his own business suddenly gets hit by a car at full force, then the car runs him over and crushes his face! Freakin' hilarious! Contrary to the title, however, it's unlikely that there was any ghost riding taking place, since it usually is a low-speed affair.

'''Description''' : A woman in black fishnets with a hand up her vagina; apparently, her colon is a bit "loose", since every time this hand plunges deeper and presumably pokes upwards, her colon partially prolapses. In the background, it appears that she's sucking on a dick all the while.

[[Wikipedia:Devil_Inside_(song)|The song], by the Australian band [[Wikipedia:INXS|INXS]], was a 1988 international hit single, making it inside the top 50 in France (20) Germany (33), Ireland (25), the UK (47) and of course, Australia (6) and the US (2). The intense popularity of this song in the States is a bit ironic, seeing as it didn't even get inside the top 5 in Australia.

'''Description''' : A fleetingly popular SWF of a man inflicting a ''cunt punch'' upon a woman (a less popular alternative to the ''cunt punt''). She pushes him away violently, there is a scene cut, and he rapidly drops to the ground and inflicts a brutal uppercut directly into her twat. She then recoils in apparent pain. 

The whole process seems awkward. This was likely staged and "fake" in that the woman was probably not actually injured.

'''Description''' : Although this warning applies to many of the videos on Discharges.org, it's worth making a special note in this instance: do ''not'' try this at home. If you do this with a sexual partner, you will probably both be hurt very badly.

This video has also made the rounds. A black guy is having vigorous (anal?) sex with a white woman who is bent forward at a 90 degree angle... while upside-down and supporting himself by doing a handstand. He does a somersault away from her, rolling forward across his back, and pulls her with him. She does a complete backflip and ends up on the floor, on her back and bent with her ass in the air and her knees almost touching her face. He ends up sitting flat on the ground right in front and immediately, vigorously starts to eat either her pussy or her ass (not visible from the video). 

An amazing acrobatic act. Unlike you and I, he truly ''is'' the shit, bitch.

'''Song''' : Lady Gaga - Pokerface

'''Lyrics sampled''' : (Po-po-po-pokerface, po-po-pokerface / Mah mah mah mah) x 2

'''Description''' : Short clip from the Japanese film, ''Machine Girl'', which shows a number of individuals who have had their faces torn off and completely exposed. Not terribly realistic and pretty lighthearted given the upbeat music in the background, but the fake blood spurting all over might distress some people.

Both the title of the page and the SWF are references to the the song; in poker, a ''tell'' is some kind of action or behavioral disposition that gives away the contents of your hand in some way (e.g. reveals that you have been bluffing). ''Bluffing'' refers to intentional deception as to the contents of your hand. A ''pokerface'' is basically a blank disposition - in other words, the exact opposite of a tell. When one has a "good pokerface", it's hard to read them and make a guess as to what kind of hand they have based on small social or behavioral cues.

The extremely catchy song is a pun of sorts; someone with no face presumably has the ultimate pokerface. In reality, since pokerface is often used to refer to more than explicit facial expressions, this isn't true, but it's a great play on words.

Extremely memorable clip from the movie ''[[Wikipedia:American|History X|American History X]]'' where one of the main characters (Derek Vinyard, a white Neo-Nazi - played by Edward Norton) gives a black man a "California Smile" (ultimately killing him). 

To give someone a "California Smile" is a euphemism for "curb-stomping", a severe punitive act in which someone is ordered to spread their mouth open across a concrete curb (ordered to [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bite+the+curb "bite the curb"]), then have the back of their skull stomped on, punched, or otherwise struck with high force. 

From the limited bit of research I did, it doesn't actually seem like this has ever been practiced extensively by any gang.

The Jewish Kabbalah is a mystical approach to the Jewish faith, "a Jewish esoterical tradition of contemplation of divine secrets," ([See [http://www.beliefnet.com/story/168/story_16883_1.html source].) 

From my understanding, most practicing Jews have spent little-to-no time studying Kabbalah, and its teachings are not integrated into any mainstream Jewish holiday or ceremony - in other words, the Jewish Kabbalah is legitimately esoteric. 

In the late 1990s-early 2000s, the study (or at least the superficial observance) of Kabbalah by non-Jews enjoyed a period of trendiness, initially among celebrities and later spreading to some of the fans that emulate them. Madonna, who still studies Kabbalah and [http://www.showbizspy.com/2008/01/10/madonna-spends-120000-a-year-on-kabbalah-water/ supports Kabbalah-inspired services], was and still is its most prominent supporter. The "red string" bracelets worn by many celebrities are Kabbalah inspired.

'''Audio''' : Jill Sobule - Kissed a Girl

'''Lyrics sampled''' : I kissed a girl (2x)

'''Description''' : The video shows two young women making out. [Not sure who they are, though.] Only distressing if you're a religious fundamentalist (or from the Southern United States).

KAG is an acronym for Kissed A Girl, as in the title of the song on this page. Jill Sobule's [[Wikipedia:Jill_Sobule_%28album%29|historical song]] was the subject of some controversy when it came out in 1995 and was banned from many radio stations in - you guessed it - the Southern US. 

In June 2008, young pop star Katy Perry put out [[Wikipedia:I_Kissed_a_Girl_%28Katy_Perry_song%29|an abomination of a song]] with the same name and theme. The song made it to the #1 spot on both Canadian and US Hot 100 charts. The music video also hit the #1 spot on MTV's TRL chart.

Unlike Jill Sobule, Perry is certainly not a lesbian, and her song is only edgy in that it slightly pushes the bar as to what is considered "acceptable fare" in mainstream pop culture. However, in the post-Ellen DeGeneres era - one where shows like Showtimes ''The L Word'' are popular among individuals of varying sexual orientations, a girl singing about kissing another girl does little more than show that the population digs straight girls acting gay for their own self-aggrandization. 

Oh, and notably, Katy Perry '''''[http://www.thenewgay.net/2008/06/katy-perry-new-gay-interview.html has never actually kissed a girl]'''''. WTF? 

The following adapted from Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:I_Kissed_a_Girl_%28Katy_Perry_song%29#Critical_reception|critical discussion of the song]]:

''Rolling Stone'', while giving her album 2/5 stars... says the supposedly rebellious "attention-grabbing" lyrics are "a vanilla recounting of her chick-on-chick exploits" and that this "acting out" is "just to get a dude's attention."... Sal Cinquemani of ''Slant Magazine'' wrote: "[Perry's single] features a throbbing beat and an infectious, bi-curious hook but its self-satisfied, in-your-face posturing rings phony in comparison to the expertly constructed ambiguities of 'Justify My Love' or practically anything in the first decade of Ani DiFranco's catalogue; it's like a tween version of DiFranco's tortured bisexual confession 'Light of Some Kind.'" 

''Hiponline.com'' wrote that the song is "not nearly as interesting or exciting as you’d expect. It’s not even half as good as Jill Sobule’s song 'I Kissed a Girl'." ''Glitterati Gossip'' agrees Sobule's song "was ten times better, because there was actual emotional content to her lyrics.

The opening book that the rainbow sprouts from is one of the enemies from the legendary SNES game ''Secret of Mana''. It's actually a very obscure reference - the prone naked woman on the pages is actually sort of an Easter egg, since it only rarely turns to that page and only does so very briefly.

A low-res, 2D image of Eazy-E is pictured. One of the little turnips with eyes from ''Super Mario Bros. II/III'' flies onto stage and hits him; the image flashes red then flips upside-down (as enemies in Super Mario Bros. II often did when you hit them).

Plenty more oddness where that came from.

'''Description''' : A slideshow of some of the more disturbing pictures available on the Internet. If any of them offend you, click [[offended|here]] for help.  For your convenience, I sacrifice my sanity to describe each picture in detail.


'''''Loading '''''

The first slide shows a black man with a digitally altered (grotesquely enlarged) penis. It displays the following message:  ''Warning: This particular flash file is disturbing. Potentially, extremely disturbing. It will probably take about a minute to load on most broad band connections, so unless you have a huge fucking E-Penis, that is, you've been around the proverbial internet block for at least a little while, you may want to just close this page now and go stick a tampon in your giant bleeding vagina, you mother fucking pansy.'' 

It loaded almost instantly for me, though.


'''''Mutilated face'''''

Gives a close-up on the face of a dead, mutilated man who appears to be of Middle Eastern descent. Large chunks of flesh are missing from his face; most of his nose is missing and most the flesh surrounding hiseye-socket is destroyed (including his eye lid being torn off - his distended eyeball is visible).


''''' Body parts '''''

A collection of mutilated body parts on the pavement; it's hard to imagine that these one all belonged to the same person. Include a foot, two arms, some unidentifiable viscera and le coup de grace, the person's head, roughly decapitated with what looks like half-the face torn loose. Unfortunately, it looks like the victim of whatever happened here was a child.


''''' A cute kitten '''''

The only truly cute picture in here! It shows an adorable and very alive kitten sitting in a blender, but the kitten doesn't seem to be in any harm - it was probably just a posed picture. 

Note: all the other pictures are extremely grim. This was probably thrown in as a sort of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_technique Ludovico treatment], the idea of it being that showing this picture alongside the gruesome ones will induce an associative revulsion to kittens.

	
''''' Missing part of head '''''

Woman has the upper right quadrant of her skull missing; her brain is visibly everted.


''''' Burn victim portrait '''''

Picture of a severe burn victim's head. This looks like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqui_Saburido it might be Jaqui Saburido] in an early stage of her healing process. I just hope she's on some good pain meds...
 

''''' Head blown away '''''

An older white man with most of his head blown away. Much of his face looks collapsed into itself; the most of the top of his skull is flayed open and flared apart. Most likely, this is a victim of suicide by a high-powered rifle or handgun - the appearance of his face suggests that he ate his gun, though he also may have put it straight against his forehead. Alternatively, he could be the victim of some other form of trauma.


''''' Black/green worms '''''

An unidentified body part (revealed as a toe in a later picture) occupied by what look like worm-like parasites. Really disgusting.

No, those were maggots, and it's a standard medical treatment for gangrene when antibiotics haven't worked. 

 
''''' Torso and legs '''''

A woman's naked, decapitated torso lying on an (autopsy?) table alongside her disembodied legs.


''''' Woman in blood '''''

An Asian woman in a white shirt lying in a puddle of blood. Blood is also smeared across her face and making her hair stick to itself. No injury is visible. This picture might be real or fake/from a movie - it's hard to say without seeing an injury.


''''' Obese woman underwater '''''

Infamous picture of a grotesquely obese woman underwater. This picture has made its rounds via e-mail - I'm recalling one that juxtaposed a picture of a "dolphin" (an attractive, thin woman gliding through the water) and a "whale" (this woman).


''''' Testicle stretching '''''

An older man with pierced nipples and a cord wrapped around his testicles. He is using the cord to stretch his testicles away from his body.

''''' Toe parasites '''''

Medical professionals (presumably; all that appears are gloved hands) removing the maggots from above from some unfortunate person's toe. Although they might be putting them in the toe intentionally for the reasons described above


''''' Rusty scissors '''''

A close-up of a woman with a seemingly-attractive body taking a pair of rusty scissors to her breast. She looks like she is using them on her nipple, but the positioning doesn't look quite right - it's hard to tell for sure. This may be a posed picture.

''''' Damaged upper-right torso '''''

An obese woman's severely damaged upper right torso (the upper part of her right breast and top of her chest) and arm. I'm not sure exactly what this is from, but it doesn't look like a burn. It might be a radiation or chemical burn, or simply the reaction to some chemical. I feel like I've seen pictures like this before, and it may actually be a severe form of cancer. Hopefully I'll be able to tell you what this is after I do my clerkship in dermatology...

It's not a very high-quality flash, partially because there's next to no body part deformation and only minimal movement along certain joints. Flash authored by ''rehd666''.

Somewhat different from most of the other animations in that it gives the entire TMNT theme song (rather than just a clip), and is also somewhat interactive (i.e. you can do something with the flash other than just looking at it).

'''Audio''' : Snoop Dogg - Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None)

'''Lyrics sampled''' : Guess who's back in the mothafuckin' house / With a fat dick for your mothafuckin' mouth

'''Description''' : Shows what looks like Dr. Ruth (?) holding a funny-looking (strap-on?) dildo under her mouth. As she opens and closes her mouth, the dildo bounces around a little. Pretty funny. She's on some NBC-show - probably ''The Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno or ''The Late Show'' with Conan O'Brien.

The song is off Snoop Dogg's 4x platinum debut solo album ''Doggystyle''. The album made it to the #1 spot on US album charts, accelerating Snoop's career and etching his name into the tablets of rap history. Although it arguably lacks some of the maturity found in some his later work, it is widely seen among hip-hop enthusiasts as contributing significantly to the evolution and redefinition of the gangsta rap genre.

This sub-domain also hosts the pictures used in one of the u/light articles.
