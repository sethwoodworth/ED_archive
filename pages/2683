'''Epic Nose Guy''' is the name given to a supplier of loli who [[protestant|protested]] in [[London]] and is facing <s>[[LOL|criminal charges]]</s> [[lulz|no consequences]] over holding up a sign as part of the [[Project Chanology]] protests. As a [[13-year-old boy|16-year-old minor]] he should [[GTFO]] for underage b& but the [[old media|newsfags]] are really latching onto this so many internets to him, his [[alcoholic|absentee]] parents and his [[child|ward]].

His crime was to describe [[Scientology]] as a cult ''in writing'' on a [[gay|protest]] [[oh exploitable|placard]]. Despite the fact that Scientology [[Fact|pretty much exactly is the modern definition of a malignant cult]] and this kid was merely agreeing with the opinion of a [http://www.xenu.net/archive/judge_quotes.html high court judge], apparently holding up a sign with the words "Scientology" and "Cult" near each other can result in you getting your [[jail|collar felt]] in the [[fail]] that is the [[UK]].

It has also been suggested that the police in this part of London, apparently, have [[buttsecks|close associations]] with [[Scientology]] and have been [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6171948.stm called out about it by the BBC] and [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/nov/22/freedomofinformation.religion The Guardian].

It started with [http://www.schnews.org.uk/archive/news632.htm an article] in [http://www.schnews.org.uk/index.php SchNews], a [[hippy|political activist]] newsletter based in [[gay|Brighton]], on 16th May 2008. A few days later, a [[Liberal guilt|left-leaning newspaper]] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/may/20/1 posted an on-line article] about ENG. The next day the [[old media|papers went mad]] and it was printed in national and London-based news.

[[Image:1up_vs_scilonb.png|thumb|Luckily, you can't screen channel comments BEFORE deleting them.]]
Following the press coverage in which $cilions refused to comment directly for the cameras, the sneaky cult members got busy on-line, setting up two Epic Nose Guy related urls which ensnare the unwary into moar of their [[Truth|cock-eyed brainwashing]].
<br>
<br>
[http://epicnoseguy.blogspot.com This one] <strike>has a poll that perhaps you would like to participate in?</strike> '''Poll removed due to massive pwnage!'''  While you're there, notice the extreme amounts of random shit with no order all over the site. Then again, we all know that the Scilons [[retarded|aren't that bright]].
<br>
<br>
[http://youtube.com/user/epicnoseguy The fake YouTube account] links directly to the former, actually claiming to be the person in question. It is full of the same old Co$ bait-and-switch tactics with the truth as you'd expect from people whose vested interest is keeping their followers posting them huge wads of cash for doing fuck all. 
<br>
<br>
Amusingly, it has a link to a [[Paul Fetch]] video, which pretty much sums up the levels of irony enjoyed by people who have surrendered their free-will to a malignant cult.

On Friday 23th May, the [[Fascist|British Crown Prosecution Service]] told the police to STFU and GTFO before returning to their usual routine of blowing cocaine up their arses and fucking [[Paul Fetch|rent boys]].

{{squote|
The CPS review of the case includes advice on what action or behavior at a demonstration might be considered to be threatening, abusive or insulting. 

The force's policing of future demonstrations will reflect this advice.

Sadly, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/23/religion the related Guardian article] didn't hot-link to [[Britchan|ebaums]] this time. Must have had Friday temps in.
