Public e-stonings
This happens when many many [[geek]]s gather on a variety of [[internets]] forums, including [[livejournal]], [[chat room]]s and [[message board]]s to flame the evil wrong-doer. In the case of the sinner being an [[LJ user]], every stone thrower will leave comments in their livejournal, recording their e-disapproval for posterity. This usually ends up with lots of [[lulz]] and [[Jesus]] killing a baby.
