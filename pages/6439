Pivot Stickfigure Animator
[[File:Pivotstick.gif|thumb|right|300px]]
'''Pivot Stick Figure Animator''' is a shitty freeware download that lets any retard "animate" stick figures. It's so simple that even complete morons could use it, which is why  morons occupy the entire userbase. The average person will download it, play with it for five minutes and then never touch it again because it's such crap.

== Userbase ==
Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. Hundreds of retarted underageb&s think that after a while they can master it, like the hotshots on jewtube. The people will always ended up with failure videos put up that have five stars only because the posters friends were the only ones who ever watch them. When you try to tell them how much they fail they will almost always reply with "I don't see you doing better." Truly a staple of debate faggotry, it is only rarely replaced with "it's my first, so of course it's going to be bad." These people are under the delusion that you always have to publish your work, no matter what.

== The average animation ==

In the pool of AIDS you swim through in the Pivot community, you may come upon one that is actually almost kind of good.
