'''Rachel "Roadkill" Corrie''', also known as "Saint Rachel the [[Bunny Pancake|Pancake]]," was an [[American]] [[wrestler]] with the [[evil]] [[ZOG|zionist regime]] in Israel™ and by coincidence happened to be in the way of [[Israel]]i [[Killdozer|bulldozer]] as it attempted to demolish a [[terrorist]]s home, and was promptly flattened. Thus, she has become an idol amongst [[arabs]] as these suckers built up a memorial in her honor and even named a street after her, [http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/43441 I swear].
==The Story==

[[Image:Pwnedcorrie_copy.jpg|thumb|[[Pwned|PWNED]]!]] 

Corrie, a [[16 year old girl]], went to [[Palestine]] to protest [[Israel]]'s horrific and genocidal practices of protecting its citizens, bulldozing family houses of suicide bombers, and guarding its borders. Corrie was an expert on the whole Palestinian conflict after reading the Dramatica articles on [[Israel]] and [[Jews]]. First, she tried to [[lie|spread the word]] in her local community. But honestly, you can only stand for so many hours in front of Whole Foods waving graphic pamphlets of dead Palestinians in peoples faces before they politely tell you to fuck off. She did that for [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3553046.ece eight whole weeks] before finally taking the hint. 

So she decided to go to Palestine. Long story short, she palled around with terrorists, burned the american flag, held up signs saying PEACE and whined like the bitch she was every time Israel tried to get revenge for a suicide bombing or rocket attack. In the end, she <s>was totally plowed by</s> got smashed by an Israeli bulldozer as it attempted to run down the home of an terrorist. Then, her Palestinian friends displayed her blooded-up and gory carcass on TV and took pictures of it for <s>making Israel look bad</s> JOURNALISTIC PURPOSES! 

Then, her carcass was tossed into a box and taken back to the USA, where her mom and dad bawwed, and asked why any bulldozer driver could be so dumb as not to stop and disobey army orders when some random bitch jumps in front of his bulldozer and shrieks at him to stop.

If you don't have [[masturbate|anything better to do]], you can [http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/16/rafah.death/ read the full story on CNN].

==Dramatic Stuff==

Since she was anti-Israel and died, she is a great example of how [[evil]] Israel was. Never mind that she was a brainless bitch low on critical thinking skills (because, after all, SHE STOOD IN FRONT OF A FUCKING <s>BULLDOZER</s> <s>JEWDOZER</s> [[Wisconsin|KILLDOZER]]), but she represents what's wrong with Israel, and, in turn, helps loonies hate [[America]] more. Of course taking a second look at this pic>>> [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Bigbulldozer.jpg], any [[dumbass]] could figure out that thing has a huge blind spot and is probably really fucking loud, so some [[whore]] stepping in front of it screaming won't do much. If you step in front of an outsize bulldozer's blind spot, what the fuck else were you expecting?

She is adored by the [[terrorist|innocent]] Palestinian people, who commend her heroic actions of saving the family home of a suicide bomber who blew up in an Israeli town, making Israel look bad, and making Jews even more hated.
You can use the Rachel Corrie incident for [[lulz]] by posting pictures of bulldozers as comments on Palestinian journals.

See [[Solidarity]].

==Cash Cow Corrie==

Corrie's grieving family have decided not to let her death be in vain. They are actively keeping her memory alive - not by continuing protests in Palestine or encouraging dialogue between the two sides. Even better! You can now buy tickets to overpriced wank plays with such [[fucktard|inspirational]] titles as ''My Name is Rachel Corrie'' (No shit, you dumb bitch) and buy [[tl:dr|books]] on her life such as ''[[emo|I Stand Alone]]'' (more like ''I Flattened Alone'', [[amirite]]?. Also what kind of [[16-year-old girl| 16 year old girl]] writes fucking [[Money|books?]])

[[Some argue]] that they are planning to release Rachel Corrie cutlery sets, mousepads and mini bulldozers, with all proceeds to go to charity.

Her death also gave her mother the idea to [[steal|raise money]] through a pancake sale.

Her parents also filed a [[lolsuit]] against the poor Israeli soldier ([http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3973144,00.html sauce]), who had no way of knowing that a dimwitted [[attention whore]] jumped in front of his bulldozer. He responded with the obligatory "[[I did it for the lulz|I did it for the lulz]]".

==Rachel Corrie Restaurant==
[[File:Soup4.jpg|thumb|Delicious Rachel Corrie Soup. Tastes like [[Chicken]].]] 
Not enough profit made from her hilarious death, in October 2010, the [[terrorists|innocent Palestinians]] decided to open a restaurant named after her. no, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3973994,00.html srsly]. The restaurant will be serving [[Foetus soup|preserved parts of her body]] in a Pita, a traditional Palestinian dish, and all profits will go to support the [[terrorism|noble cause]] that Corrie supported.

Coming soon, '''Rachel Corrie [[whore|Brothel]].'''

==Secret Information about Rachel Corrie==
* ''Rachel'' is possibly the most [[Jewish]] female name in the world. Although at least 100 Jewish girls named Rachel were purposely murdered by Palestinian freedom fighters, none of them deserve a broadway play.
* Her [[homosexual|boyfriend]] is happy she is dead
* Her father works in insurance, and should have told her about the risk of standing in front of a moving bulldozer, especially one with a Jew inside
* She used to make [[dead baby joke]]s all the time
* After the soldier was done paving Rachel, he got out, stood on top of the bulldozer, leaned back and screamed[[WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY]]! (It's a Jewish vampire thing, you wouldn't understand, goy).
* Bulldozer driver was justified by the israeli court, long live the fairest court in the world!
