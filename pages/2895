'''Fauxlimia''' is a disease suffered by [[16 year old girls|teenage girls]] and [[homosexual|gay men]] who are [[attention whore|starved for attention]], as opposed to food. It is an easy way to get all the glamor and attention associated with having an [[eating disorder]], without having to put up with hunger pangs or taste bile. 

While there are no known pro-fauxlimia communities yet, it is only a matter of time before someone claims (in the style of the [[Otherkin]]) that they have the ''soul'' of a bulimic, and that this should be good enough for the ana/mia camp.
