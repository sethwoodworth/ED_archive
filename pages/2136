'''''Death Note''.'''
'''Story by:''' Tsugumi Ohba (大場つぐみ)　
'''Manga by:''' Takeshi Obata (小幡健)


The plot is simple: Yagami Light (prononuced I'm-a-gay), a typical prep-school jerk, god wannabe, and part-time man whore, finds a magic notebook ([[teh]] Death Note) that kills people simply by writing their name in said notebook. After finding the notebook, Light calls himself 'Kira' which is the [[engrish]] way Japanese people say "killer". Apparently, this [[manga]] series is very popular in Japan. The only reason the series has even lasted this long is due to [[Yaoi]] obsessed [[fangirls]] turning all the characters gay. [[Some_argue|Some say]] this is [[Retarded|redundant]]. Possibly the biggest, most overrated, Faggotry of an anime of all time. Think of it as the Twilight of the anime world. 

Light Yagami is [[gay]] solely because ''Yagami'' spelled backwards reads ''Im a gay.'' The transcription of Japanese characters into Roman letters is never just a weak attempt to take two languages that formed in isolation from one another and make one vaguely coherent to speakers of the other, therefore this has something to do with his/her sexuality, and nothing to do with the fact that it means "Night God."  

Sources also state that the retarded detective L (yes the letter L) finds that it would be a brilliant idea to CHAIN himself to Light with the excuse that he needed to watch Light at all times. To prove that he is not Kira. Also L states, in the animu/manga, that he needs to keep a eye on him, even in the bathroom. Creepy? Perhaps.

Sum the plot up faster?
Light is an emo freak who wants to become god of all [[animu]] characters and thinks that by using the Death Note he will reign supreme, even though he still lives with his mom. But first he has to get past insane Pedophai-L who only wants to capture him and chain him to a bed post. Fun!

==The Death Note==
[[Image:LightandRyuk.jpg|thumb|[[homosexual|Light]] and [[Michael Jackson|Ryuk]] on their best days.]]
A person whose name is written in the Death Note dies after 40 seconds.  Even better, you get to pick the cause of death as well.  You could choose "vehicular homicide" even if the victim is on the top floor of a skyscraper, and the car will take the elevator.  Light uses the book to kill criminals in order to create what he considers "the perfect world" and act as [[Moderator|God]] in it, thus achieving [[Hitler]]'s unfinished work.  Then he made a mistake by writing his penis' name in the Death Note.  The cause of death was bone cancer, although in the director's cut, he accidentally rips it of while masturbating to a picture of L.

Along with the notebook comes a "shinigami" (死神 = <strike>Death God</strike> [[Furfag]]), the interracial mix of a [[Pokemon]] with a [[Tim Burton]]-esque mental perversion.  Light's particular shinigami is named Ryuk (Pronounced [[WRY]]-[[UK]]), the [[japan|Japanese]] pronunciation of "Luke".  He's an invisible Mansonite voyeur who sleeps inside Luke's [[ass]] at night and replaced Luke's penis after it died.

The Death Note was actually based on Encyclopedia Dramatica.  Paper Death Notes are actually impotent, possibly because Satan loves trees.  Of course, some people are so [[retard|fucking retarded]] that they think all this is real:

==Characters==
[[File:NaomiMisoraAnHero.png|thumb|With the power of the Death Note, Naomi Misora becomes [[an hero]]]]
*[[Diustin Biber|Light Yagami]]: Also known [[God|Kira]], Light Yagami is the protagonist of Death Note, and has a strong obsession with becoming a god. At first, no one wants him to be god because they realize [[unfunny|his name spelled backwards is "Im a gay"]] and if America can't have <s>a black guy for president</s> (TOO LATE), they aren't going settle for a faggot. It should also be noted that the anagram of "Raito Yagami" is "I am a gay riot." When he first meets L on his graduation day, he finds it awkward that a guy so hot and [[My Immortal|sexy]] is sitting next to him, so he immediately seizes the opportunity and starts hitting on him. Since L is [[naive|goatse]], he takes this as a come on "just as friends" and later gives him a [[Blowjob|foot massage]]. After L realizes Light was actually gay, he fakes his own death, and goes on a vacation to Disney Land. Light then takes [[jailbait|Misa]] as his girlfriend to cover up his homosexuality. He gets pwnt by Ryuuk as he no longer bore the sufficient amount of [[lulz]] to please the bored Shinigami.

*[[Mewtwo|Ryuuk]]: An [[heroin|apple]]-addicted [[pokeman|Shinigami]] and grinning homosexual rapist, Ryuuk makes possible the thousands of deaths caused by Kira [[IDIFTL|for his own entertainment]]. He kills Light with the Death Note in the end, as promised, and then evolves into Gengar at Level 75 after being traded.

*[[Basement dweller|L]]: The [[13 year old|25 year old]] manchild [[Shit nobody cares about|who is named L Lawliet]]. He is a [[Fucktard|smartass]] [[google|detective]] trying to capture [[AIDS|Kira]]. Lacks socks like [[Einstein]], because the Jew doesn't know how to tie his shoes. The retard doesn't even know how to use a [[fucking magnets|fucking cellphone]]. After finding out Light was gay he fakes his death, steals Misa's panties, and runs away to Disney Land. He has no friends and is a [[v/|/v/irgin]]. He is the closest thing to [[Michael Jackson]] in the series, which is why everybody [[hates|likes him]].

*[[80 year old Chinese man in panties|Watari]]: L's samurai manservant, Watari's purpose is to indulge L's [[penis|rampant agoraphobia]] and act as a [[whore|liaison]] to the Japanese police. He is [[almost raped|killed off]] by [[faggot|Rem]] as a fun [[fap|warmup]] for [[homo|Ryuuzaki]].

*[[13 year old boys|Mello and Near]]: After L dies, these two [[shota]] from [[basement|Watari's School For Gifted And Talented Children]] are chosen to take his [[buttsex|place]]. [[shit nobody cares about|Near]] probably eats his [[bad dragon|toys]], and [[Hard Gay|Mello]] eats [[shit|chocolate]] that doesn't affect his [[fat|weight]] in any way because apparently, people who eat [[penis|sweets]] don't get fat. All of the [[crap|chocolate]] Mello eats goes straight to Watari's [[ass|thighs]]. Mello is always dressed in some sort of [[BDSM|tight black leather outfit]], which is his way of soliciting for gay sex. Oh, and, [[shit noone cares about|Near]] is a [[shotacat|pedophile]]. This is obvious because he keeps [[shota|a picture of Mello at 14]] on him at all times for four years, until Mello comes to retrieve [[cock|it]]. Mello doesn't even dare question what that [[semen|suspicious looking crusty white stain on the photo]] is.

*[[fangirl|Amane Misa]]: The [[attention whore|slutty 16 year old faghag idol]] who wants to [[fuck]] Light until she dies. She's also [[time paradox|another fucktard with a Death Note]] who would [[slut|kill anyone if you wanted]]. [[Some argue]] that after Light dies, she herself [[an hero|dies of a broken heart.]]

*[[Hello Kitty|Rem]]: [[shit nobody cares about|A female Shinigami who wants to fist Misa. This unnatural lust is exploited by Light to manipulate Rem into knocking off L and Watari for him.]]

*[[An hero|Mikami Teru]]: An [[e-lawyer]] and OCD fucktard who just wanted [[buttsex|appreciation]] from [[Jesus|Kira]]. He fucks up Light's final plan and is lucky enough to get a branching death: [[Shit Nobody Cares About|In the manga, his faggotry is made less prominent as insults Light for leading them both to this, when, in actually, he was the person to fuck up. He later rots in prison, although some speculate Near killed him. Light by In the last episode, he pwnt himself with a pen when he screws up Light's evil plan. Should be noted that he likes sakujo and LOVES FUCKING ELIMINATING]].

===Death Note & Yaoi===
[[Image:lolfanservice.jpg|thumb|The reason why so much ''Death Note'' yaoi exists.]]
[[Image:Death_note_anime_yaoi.gif|thumb|More fanservice.]]

As predictable, ''Death Note'' has spawned countless [[yaoi]] doujinshi, fanfictions, and fanart. The main duo featured is always LightxL or LxLight. Those are silly stories where they [[OMFG]] have [[anal sex]] like wabbits on heat and all that fucking jazz. There are also doujinshi with Light and other sideshows, like some nasty ones about the Shinigami's massive inhuman [[cock]] filling Light's [[ass]]. Sometimes [[mpreg]] is also featured; typically with Light being the one shoving a fetus out of [[Old Gregg|his magical vagina.]]  

Other popular ''Death Note'' Yaoi couples include Mello/Near and Matt/Mello. There are also many [[moar]] featuring [[Lemonparty|the entire detective squad and Watari.]]

===JUST AS PLANNED===
[[Image:JUST AS PLANNED.jpg|thumb|At first I was like.]]
[[File:NOT_AS_PLANNED.PNG|thumb|But then I was like.]]
Like ''Naruto'' with his "[[habeeb it|BELIEVE IT!]]", Steve Urkel with his "Did I do that?", and Nazis with their "HEIL HITLER", ''Death Note'' now has its own catchphrase.
{{quote|JUST AS PLANNED.| Light}}

Whenever a certain thread or argument comes up on 4Chan and Anonymous tricks some poor fucker, there will always be a picture of Light with an evil look on his face from one of the episodes (or manga) with the caption, "JUST AS PLANNED." Or, if things go wrong, there is always a shooped image of Light frowning and the words replaced with, "NOT AS PLANNED."

It has yet to become as famous as [[Longcat]] and be its own [[meme]].

There is a part where some guy starts eliminating people, [[some argue|(though some may argue]] [[Delete fucking everything|that he's deleting them)]] and the Japanese way of saying eliminate is "Sack a Jew". Then [[I came|he orgasms]] for some reason. Writing names in a notebook must be really physically draining.

===The Manga Murders (IRL Drama)===
[[Image:Anneke_manga2.jpg|thumb|left|Article on the first Manga Murder. Nothing of value was lost.]]

[[Last Thursday]], three [[Belgium|Belgian]] men discovered the legs and torso of an unidentified [[white man]] in a park in Brussels. The corpse was accompanied by two notes which (Get ready to facepalm) both read the misspelled Japanese phrase "WATASHI WA KIRA DESS."   Now you would probably say that the notes were planted by [[Wapanese]] medical [[students]] as a [[lulz|prank]], but the police, and professors of the University of Brussels medicine department, rule out this option. Besides this, the genitals of the victim had been [[gay|shaved]], a detail pointing to the homoerotic nature of the ''Death Note'' Manga. Secondly, besides Japan, Belgium is the only country in the world where [[manga|comic books for children]] are taken [[Serious Cat|seriously]]. It is most likely that ''Death Note'' has spawned its first copycat killer. 

{{quote|La Dernière Heure, a French daily newspaper in Belgium similar to United Kingdom's The Sun or America's New York Post, reports that two identical messages linked to the Death Note manga were left near severed body parts that were discovered Friday afternoon in the forest of Belgium's Duden Park. According to the newspaper, the two paper sheets both say "Watashi wa Kira dess," an apparent misspelling of the Japanese phrase "Watashi wa Kira [[suiseiseki|desu]]," or "I am Kira (Killer)." This is a catchphrase from writer Tsugumi Ooba and artist Takeshi Obata's Death Note [[shit|suspense]] manga series, in which a [[13 year old boy|high school boy]] discovers a notebook which allows him to kill people by writing their names in it.| Anime News Network|[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-10-01/notes-left-near-bodies-in-belgium-linked-to-death-note]}}

The [[old media]] are already calling this "The Manga Murders," and if [[great justice]] still exists in the world, this should spark an anti-[[anime]] [[lollercoaster|backlash]] even more hilarious than the one caused by the UK release of ''[[guro|Legend of the Overfiend]]''.

This was not the first manga-related murder in [[The Netherlands|Belgium]]. A year earlier a young [[slut|mangaka]], named Anneke van der Stap, went missing. Her decomposed body was found a few weeks later in a dark alleyway. Instead of coming to the [[rape|most logical conclusion]], the Dutch media spread rumors about a lurid manga-underground, filled with crime and mayhem. We all know Japanimation attracts some sick fucks, so for the [[lulz]], let's believe the gutter press.

==Death Note: The Movie(s)==
[[Image:Death-note.jpg|thumb|The ''Death Note'' movie is considered the greatest movie of all time by fans and faggots alike.]]

{{spoilers|L BECOMES [[An Hero|AN HERO]] BUT DEFEATS LIGHT FIRST, LIGHT'S DAD SHOOTS LIGHT, AND RYUK KILLS LIGHT}}
In 2006 not one, but three ''Death Note'' movies were made.  All ''Death Note'' fans think all three [[Lie|were the greatest movie ever made]]. There are many differences in the movie, for one Light has a girlfriend whom he only has to hide his inner [[faggot]]. Another one is that Light's dad is the loud Asian guy on Iron Chef (no rly look for yourself), therefore making him an expert chef, cooking gourmet meals by day fighting crime by night, <b>I AM IRON CHEF</b>. The plot is pretty much the same, except more white people and [[Giant Faggot|Ultraman]] is on the police force (he's the guy that stands in the back).

==Rating==
Action: 4, for all the [[what|retardedintellibabble]] from Light and especially L. Also Watari is a level 50 in [[Halo|Team Snipers]].

Lulz: 8 for some(see: a ton) of the over the top shit, such as Light eating a potato chip, his girly-man batshit laugh at the end, and for everything going JUST AS PLANNED.
