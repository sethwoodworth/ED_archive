'''Middle East''' can refer to one of the following countries:
*[[Europe]] [[File:Euro-Flag.png|20px]] 
*[[Iraq]] [[File:Flag of Kurdistan.png|20px]]
*[[Israel]] [[File:Flag of Israel.png|20px]]
*[[Lebanon]] [[File:Lebanon.gif|20px]]
*[[Palestine]] [[File:Palestinian flag.jpg|20px]]
*[[Saudi Arabia]]
*[[Detroit|The Sultanate of Dearborn]]
*[[Syria]]
*[[Dubai|United Arab Emirates]]

The Middle East's exports are [[terrorism]], falafels, designer sunglasses, and fanatical [[religion|religious]] [[Fundamentalist|zealots]] known as [[fanboys]]. Its imports are the weapons needed to fight its endless wars.

'''FACT:''' The Middle East is part of the continent of [[Asia]] and when people say they're [[Azn]] and talk about ''Azn Pryde'', they refer to this part of Asia and not a bunch of Mongoloids who live in islands like [[Japan]] that aren't even part of [[Asia]].  So remember this and tell everyone this.
