Doodle
Famous [[GameFAQs]] [[lolcow]] from way back in the early 2000s.  His legacy, for the most part, ended after he threw some sort of aspie fit and gave the account to DarkCobra and others.  After his aspie attack was over he demanded it back; the moderators settled the argument by outright banning the account.

While most people on the [[Internet]] claim to have it, many people think Doodle might've been a genuine [[asspie]], his legacy lives on as a [[lulz]]worthy quote list:<BR><BR>
