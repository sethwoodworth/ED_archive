The Juggernaut
The Juggernaut is a fictional character in the ''[[X-Men]]'' series. His popularity soared when Randy Hayes and Xavier Nazario made an [[unfunny]] dub of an episode of the ''X-men'' animated series (the old one, not the even suckier ''Evolution'' series Fox made to leech off the success of the first movie).

Thanks to them, it inspired some other assholes to redub other cartoons. ''[[Doug]]'' and ''Dexter's Laboratory'' to name a few.

The writers of the third ''X-men'' movie were so gay that they [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T4OYAx_c0Y included the infamous line], most likely to get brownie points with the fans in a desperate attempt to atone for having cut Gambit from the character roster.

The same niggers called up two of their friends, Sonny Benitez and Eddie Vasquez (estranged brother of [[Jhonen Vasquez]]), and made a two part sequel, entitled ''J2: Juggment Day'' out of footage from ''The Juggernaut Returns''.

==Memorable Lines==

While "I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!" is the most famous line from the redub, there are several other notable phrases that assholes like to spout off whenever possible, including, but not limited to:

* Silly bitch, your weapons cannot harm me!
* Don't you know who the fuck I am?
* Got my [[pimp]] cane, bitch!
* I'll beat the shit out ya, Charles (sometimes subbed out for the name of the person they are addressing). I'll beat the shit out ya ''wit'' Charles, as a matter of [[fact]].
* This is a Dodge.
* I'm ketchup, [[Duke Otterland|motherfucker]].
* I'm made of Laffy Taffy.
* I'm going kill him, and [[rape]] him, and eat his fuckin' costume.
* Comb your beard. I don't wanna hear that shit.
* I'm a part-time [[stripper]] ''and'' I do hair.
* I'm the Juggernaut, bitch, and I gots a [[bitch]] wit me!
* I wonder what the fuck is on tv tonight.
* What up, mon ami?
* Initiate laser dodging!
* Not as long as I'm wearin' these Jamaican colors!
* My [[boob|breasts]] are good for something.
* Jugg's gotcha!
* And in this corner the welterweight champion The Juggernaut, bitch! Why the <b>fuck</b> is this shit fallin'?
* I like yo raincoat!
* [[Optimus Prime|Optimus muthafuckin' <i>Prime</i>?!]]
* [[Homosexuality|Charles, you know damn well the last time I went to Juggrassic Park to get a haircut by a Velociraptor, I left with a tattoo on my nuts, a Prince Albert and I had some graphic on my asshairs and I got a new tattoo on my chest that say "Long-Dick Willy."]]

<s>The sequal to ''The Juggernaut Bitch'' has no memorable lines because it is even more unfunny than the original and thus not [[meme]]-worthy.</s> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]

==Practical Applications==

There aren't any. Although there was a recorded instance on the [http://www.hitmanforum.com/forum/index.php? Hitmanforum] wherein member OverGrad47 made a [http://www.hitmanforum.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=35875&hl=juggernaut lame ass thread] and another member, Captian Steve, [http://www.hitmanforum.com/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=35875&view=findpost&p=781969 posted the script to ''The Juggernaut Bitch'' in it]. Whether his purpose in doing so was to bring lulz to the thread, [[pwn]] OverGrad47, or to simply raise his post count is not certain, but it is clear that he [[winnar|"won the thread"]].

==YouTube Douche Baggery==
JewTube removed all copies of ''The Juggernaut Bitch'' from its site due to "copyright infringement", but we all know it's because they did WTC.

However, you can still find the video on Google video. YouTube isn't the only place people put stupid shit.

==Hulk Vs Juggernaut==
Both Juggernaut and the [[The Incredible Hulk]] are both constantly cited as two of the strongest fags in all of Marvel Comics. However, die-hard fans of both characters often fight over which of the [[gay|strong-men]]  are, in fact, the superior fighter. Thankfully, some [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlnE8ZwOEVs Norwegianfag] on JewTube has straightened it out for them. However, this fag happens to be a die-hard Hulk [[fanboy]], so his opinion is still worth [[nothing|nothing]]. 

In the ''World War Hulk'' story line, Hulk and Juggernaut do fight each other, bringing much [[porn|joy]] too all comicfags. Hulk won when he told Juggernaut to [[GTFO]] and Juggernaut did because he's a dumb shit and can't stop running once he starts.
