Deathy
{{pixplz}}
'''Deathy''', or Deathosaurus, or whatever he's calling himself this week, is one of the most bizarre members on the Transformer fandom.  

He first gained notoriety on the usenet group [[transformers|alt.toys.transformers]] for his INSANE and random capitaliZATION, occasionally putting words in (parentheses) for no reason and drawing ---> arrows in the middle of a sentence.  Deathy also likes to use unnecessary/unneeded/dispensible slashes between similar/comparable/equivalent words to show that he's a walking/strolling/ambling thesaurus. Deathy is essentially the prototypical [[WebTV]] user: incoherent, full of rage, and connected to the [[internets]] by a goddamn Commodore 64.

His outlandish claims of being the biggest and greatest at everything drew a lot of heat, as did his arrogance about robot toys. The constant [[flame war|flaming]] pissed him off, and thus began his bi-weekly trend of [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/1ce8daaf7909a600?hl=en& leaving the newsgroup forever] and then coming back days later with [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/efa92a8bb31aa49d?hl=en& a clever disguise.]

==Retaliation==
While most people eventually figured that Deathy was a gentle tard to be loved, some disliked him anyway, and attempted to engage in [[flame war]]s with him. Two of his first victims were [[Neale Davidson]] and Knightheart. First, Deathy began a rant against Neale that [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/dbdcf59426c85b?hl=en& turned into a whacky rape fantasy.]  Later he elaborated on it with [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/146517577c09f22a?output=gplain the greatest headmaster fanfic ever.]

His best would come later, as he dropped the biggest [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/a5cd7fda89f12c7c?hl=en& nuclear bomb] of a [[fanfic]] ever on the fandom.
