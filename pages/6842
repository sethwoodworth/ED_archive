RationalWiki
The '''RationalWiki''' (RW) is an amusing wiki created with the purpose of documenting what it considers to be [[bullshit|pseudoscience]] and anti-science along with religious fundamentalism, namely by refuting virtually every article on [[Conservapedia]], its mortal enemy. Given Conservapedia's astonishingly insane content, it's not a difficult job, but essentially, RationalWiki has become [[obsessed]] with those damned conservatives, in particular to disparage [[Andy Schlafly]] (see below) and [[rape|obliterate his anus]] with its powerful [[shlong]] of rationality. Therefore, RationalWiki has become to Conservapedia what [[Basement Cat]] is to [[Ceiling Cat]]. 

RW's editors and sysops consist of [[infidel]]s, [[agnostic]]s, [[Mega ultra super genius|freethinkers]], [[pastafarian]]s and proud [[faggot]]s. 


==Content==

Despite its name, the RationalWiki isn't a reaction to [[Illogicopedia]]; instead, it's a [[Immigrant|melting pot]] of pure [[butthurt]] from [[Conservapedia]]. Its stated purpose (taken from the site) is as follows:

#Analyzing and refuting [[pseudoscience]] and the [[Intelligent design|anti-science]] movement.
#Documenting the full range of [[crank]] ideas.
#Explorations of [[1984|authoritarianism]] and [[Christfag|fundamentalism]].

By "pseudoscience" and "anti-science", RationalWiki users generally mean [[Creationism]]. RationalWiki consider any scientific idea not taught to them by their [[high school]] science teacher to be irrational nonsense.

===WIGO pages===
Criticizing Conservative Christian sites is one of the RationalWiki users' favorite pastimes. The RationalWiki hosted several ''What is going on at…?'' (WIGO) pages. Of these, the [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conservapedia:What_is_going_on_at_CP%3F What is going on at CP?] page is the largest and most popular. In fact, that page is the [http://www.google.com/search?q=rationalwiki second Google search result for "rationalwiki"]. RationWiki users would waste hours of their lives watching Conservapedia's RecentChanges for any little piece of dirt that they can get their hands on and display them on the WIGO page. The RationalWiki even have a [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Special:Version bunch of custom extensions] for the WIGO pages in order to "enable" the obsessions of RationalWiki users.

===Deconstructing Andy===
[[File:AndrewSchlafly conservapedia.jpg|thumb|125px|Their favorite pastime: [[raping]] [[Andrew Schlafly|this man]] on a [[No life|daily basis]].]]

To say that rationalwikians focus all their energy on every single stupidity that comes out of Andy Schlafly's head is an understatement. They have dismantled Schlafly's mind, body and soul, analyzing and psychoanalyzing his personal and professional life, his debating tactis, his concerns and his obsessions, even imagining how the asshat behaved as a kid. 

Add to that dozens of essays, anagrams, games and poems; a comparative study of Schlafly and [[Black Jesus]]; [[wikistalking]]; a rock opera (written by RW's resident gays); and endless, massive ridiculing directed at Andy himself and his cronies. What you have is a morbid fascination with a guy who is, plain and simple, a fuckwit who does not deserve the slightest [[attention]].

==RW and ED: [[SNCA]]==

RationalWiki doesn't have a good relationship with [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Contrary to popular belief, ED isn't a liberal stronghold. In fact, ED is home to many [[libertarians]], fags, dykes and kikes. On November 17, 2007, some butthurt [[fag]] named [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/PyroPython PyroPython] [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=prev&oldid=95294 created] the RationalWiki's ED article (not a surprise considering that the entire wiki was created by banned users). On February 3, 2008, the article was [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica&diff=118331&oldid=118133 rewritten in a more neutral tone]. Before the rewrite the article had the following text:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">
<p>Encyclopædia Dramatica is a [[Wikipedia]]  "parody" that tries desperately to be funny. Despite all of their attempts (which almost invariably consist of belittling others on the [[internet]] and attempts at "shock humour"), they fail to understand that [[goatse]] and porn '''''don't''''' make people laugh.</p>

<p>In many ways they are like USENET's [[alt.tasteless]] gone completely out of control.</p>

<p>It might be one of the few websites worse than [[Conservapedia]].</p>

<p>'''Update:''' ED may yet redeem themselves, to a degree, as an active contributor in the war against [[Scientology]] [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Chanology].</p>
</blockquote>

Sadly the "new and improved" article isn't as funny as the above text, but it did succeed in hiding their inner butthurt selves (well, at least until you view the page history or this article).

Although RW has inspired the expansion of our very article on [[Conservapedia]] and the creation of the article on [[Andy Schlafly]], as well as the ongoing investigation on [[Ed Poor]]'s pedophilia, ED's Urban Space Cowboy actually created the CP article on February 21, 2007, whereas RationalWiki 2.0 was founded by some guy named Colin on May 22, 2007, with the help of Trent Toulouse. 

Urban Space Cowboy left our dimension in 2008.

==Users==
===Administration===
The RationalWiki has a liberal approach to promoting users to sysops. Just about any active, "good-faith" contributor can become a sysop. Even [[Alison]] has sysop rights there. A full list of sysops can be [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special%3AListUsers&group=sysop&limit=50 found here].

Proving that bitchfights over religion are not limited to [[youtube]] [[teenagers]], some RW admins, like Trent Toulouse and Ames Grawer, infiltrated Conservapedia with [[troll|honorable]] intentions, but they were detected and banned for life. CP sysop [[loser|Brian Macdonald]] and [[Andy Schlafly]] himself launched some legal threats to Trent and Ames, yet they never materialized. Schlafly, despite that he's been online for more than ten years, is still oblivious to the inner workings of the internets, and that [[flame wars]] are futile.

===Vandal defense===
As with any other open, "anyone can edit" wiki, the RationalWiki is pron to [[vandal]] attacks. Not only can sysops ban users, but they can also slow them down too. The RationalWiki has a special extension known as [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Special:VandalBin VandalBreak]. As with most of RationalWiki's extensions, this extension was created by [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/User:Nx Nx]. This extension can be used by sysops to slow the rate at which suspected vandals can edit pages (eg. 1 edit per minute). This frustrates hopeful vandals into giving up or using proxies in order to creating new accounts.

==Re-vamping RationalWiki==
===RationalWiki 1.0===
[[Ironic]]ally all of the original RW editors were originally banned [[Conservapedia]] editors. In 2007, several [[OCD|wiki-obsessed]] [[evolutionists]] from [[Wikipedia]] felt that they could gain acceptance on the Conservative Christian wiki known as [[Conservapedia]]. They, of course, were completely [[wrong]]. Eventually, these former Conservapedia hopefuls were [[banned]] or [[Harass|provoked]] into [[Ragequit|ragequiting]]. These Conservapedian rejects were gathered up and RationalWiki was formed.

The first incarnation of RationalWiki was a invite-only site. Rational 1.0 was a hidden hive of [[liberal]] freethinkers and have mostly used for Conservapedia-related discussions. They often discussed their [[vandalism]] at Conservapedia. Unfortunately, while the RationalWiki users were discussing the CP users' stupidity, stealthy Conservapedia [[ninjas]] learned the secret RationalWiki handshake, infiltrated the wiki, and exposed all of their secrets.

===RationalWiki 2.0===
[[File:14a.gif|thumb|Their god. Oh wait... if they don't believe in God, they cannot believe in Satan either. Or can they? Actually, who kows. Maybe.]]

Realising that ceaselessly moaning about [[christfags]] made them look as [[retarded]] as the very [[christfags]] they were moaning about, RationalWiki did the first rational thing by banning most of its members.
After the infiltration and the banning of several RationalWiki members from the RationalWiki, the sysops decided to take the wiki in a new direction. They [[Delete fucking everything|reset the wiki]] and started over from scratch. The wiki has now open to everyone and their contributions. Of course, this doesn't mean that RationWiki 2.0 is open to everyone's thoughts, especially the ones deemed "irrational".

==[[Trolling]] RationalWiki==
As with all fundamentalists trolling them may not be as easy as it may first appear due to their inability to listen to anything they do not agree with. [[Kill it with fire|Fighting fire with fire]] may be the best method.

'''Proven by SCIENCE:'''
*RationalWiki rejects any idea that challenges other mainstream scientific ideas, such as the Theory of Relativity. RationalWiki doesn't seem to realize that science is dynamic, and established theories may be rejected in the future.

*The RationalWiki also opposes what it considers to be "authoritarianism", which is the quality they apply to [[Republicans|American conservatism]]. Although conservatives seek to shrink the size of the government and the amount of money people are [[Taxes|forced to pat into it]], RationalWiki users somehow believe that [[George Bush|conservative are seeking to have the government control everything]].

*They claim that [[Uncyclopedia]] is funny, but it's beyond dispute that [[truth|Uncyclopedia is not funny]]. Without question. Fucking unfunny. Srsly. This has been proven ad nauseam by the internets' foremost experts.
