'''Oovoo''' is a [[camwhore]]'s favorite software to communicate with their clients. It has been proved that camwhore's don't use [[Skype]] very often because you can't connect to your clients in a [[3Guys1Hammer|4-way-call]] like you can on Oovoo. Oovoo is also heavily used by [[16-year-old girls]] and [[13-year-old boys]]. Apparently ooVoo was made for two different operating systems [[Windows]] & [[Mac OS X]]. Sorry [[Linux]] users, you penguin [[faggots]] are out of gas. Unlike Skype, even if you're making a toll-free-number call to somewhere, [[Fail|you still need to pay for credits]]. So basically, there is no way to troll here. Oovoo isn't only used by [[camwhores]] and teens, but it is also used by many [[pedophiles]]. What pedophile wouldn't use ooVoo? That's like saying no to protected sex.
