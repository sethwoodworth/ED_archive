A [[retarded]] website, now found at [http://www.ikissyou.org/ '''ikissyou.org'''], created by '''Mahir Çağrı''', a [[pervert|horny]] [[old]] [[Turkey|Turkish]] guy with a Jew. Mahir became one of the first [[internet celebrity|internet celebrities]] in 1999 when the world found his shitty [[Web 1.0]] website which proclaimed "WELCOME TO MY HOME PAGE! I KISS YOU!", launching the phrase into [[meme]] status. [[Some argue|Some people]] say that Mahir marks the beginning of the [[Internet]] tradition of rewarding [[fail]]ure, but [[you|they]] are [[wrong]]. After a certain amount of public exposure, Mahir tried to blame the sexy parts of his website on a hacker, but this is obviously a [[lie]].

==Borat==
[[Image:Ukoad3.jpg|thumb|Mahir v Borat : Mahir favored 6:5]]

For Mahir, his legacy lives on in Sacha Baron Cohen's "[[Borat]]" character, who bears more than a passing resemblance to the Turk. Mahir has threatened to sue Borat's ass for [[plagiarism]], but so far he has been [[loser|unable to find a lawyer.]][http://celebs.electronicnewsnetwork.com/sacha-cohen/]

Mahir has long contended that [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]'s character Borat is based on him and his website. Unfortunatly, Borat's prototype "Kristo" had been aired on TV more than once before Mahir's site went live in 1999. This is another obvious case of an [[Arab]] being jealous of a Jew. He gave a bunch of angsty interviews and asked WIRED for help getting a lawyer, but is still waiting for an apology or some monies.
