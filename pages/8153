The Burden of Proof
{{elaw}} 
When in an argument, everybody else has '''The Burden of Proof''' except for you. Without The Burden of Proof, we get the [[Cycle of Blame]].

==Internet Standard of Proof==
In [[IRL]] courts, there are two standards of proof: Preponderance of Evidence and Beyond Reasonable Doubt. With the invention of the [[Internets]], a third standard of proof developed, aptly named the Internet Standard of Proof, or ISP.

Under the Internet Standard of Proof, the following things are considered proof:
* [[Opinion]]
* [[Anecdotal evidence]]
* Pudding
* The [[Holocaust]] (see [[Godwin's Law]])
* [[9/11]]
* [[Timecube|Non-linear time]]

==How to Transfer The Burden of Proof==
The following is a common technique used by [[e-lawyers]]:
:Prima: "[[God]] exists."
:Secunda: "No, he does not."
:Prima: "Prove it."

By saying "prove it", Prima transfers the burden of proof to Secunda.  Secunda is now charged with providing [[facts]] proving that God does not exist.

Transferring the burden (TTB) can also be done by the use of [[graph]]s.
