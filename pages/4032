'''Inkpop''' is a website run by Harper Collins with the intent to attract [[Jailbait|young adults]], and [[Pedophiles|young adult writers]]. Harper Collins also runs [[Authonomy|Authonomy]], geared to adults. Like Authonomy, the main goal of posting badly-written Twilight rip-offs is to reach the top 5 at the end of each month to have HC review the first 10,000 words of the manuscript.
Since the main users of the website are [[16 year old girls]], the site is full of poetry about how hard it is to be a rich white kid in America. 

==How it Works==

*Books, poems, short stories, and essays can be posted online. 

*Each book is ranked by the amount of people who add it to their picks list.

*Each person has a trendsetter rating, based on the popularity of how many swaps they did.

*In order to reach the top 5, most users have to be popular.

*Harper Collins editors review each book in the top five and give it a vague comment on why they can't publish it.

*The writers then cry to their [[You don't have any friends|friends]] that Harper Collins didn't read the whole thing.

==Important People==

* Joana

Joana was Inkpop's resident [[faggot]], a former "top five picks" writer, and one of the forum moderators before she had her account deleted. She spends all day touching herself to the Inkpop newsfeed and then talking about the dramas with her [[faggot | groupies]] because she has no life and needs to fill it up with [[loser | something]]. She has been cited as being insanely jealous of one girl's popularity, so far as to become [[gay | obsessed]] with anything she does. Given the fact that this section disappeared shortly after it was added, we can safely assume Joana was the one who wrote this article. 

==Important Books==
*[http://inkpop.com/projects/26309/heroes-of-destiny-book-i-the-eternal-war/ Heroes of Destiny]
The most [[epic]] book ever written, Heroes of Destiny is the story of author Kevin Wong, author of Heroes of Destiny, writing about how [[WTF | he is actually a competent swordsman in the middle ages]], or something like it.  No one is really sure when it takes place because things like showers and toothbrushes show up.  It's basically Don Quixote, except the [[insane]], delusional protagonist is real and is the one writing the book.  [[not really | It is worth noting]] that the full title is Heroes of Destiny Book I: The Eternal War, which means Kevin Wong, author of Heroes of Destiny, must be working on a [[Electric Boogaloo| sequel]].

==Important Poems==
There aren't any because most of the site is smart enough to know poetry is [[gay]].

==Character Chats==

Popular among [[furries | many users]] are "character chats," in which [[gay | they pretend to be people they aren't]], much like [[cosplayers]] or politicians.  They believe the "character chats" help them improve "characters" in their [[crap | books]], so they flood the forums with several thousand of them at once.  There is lingering animosity between "character chat"ters and users not bored enough with their lives to join in.  Officially, however, the two species are [[Axis of Evil | allies]] and [[war | they enjoy civil, if cool, diplomatic relations]].

==Watch Out!==
Despite giving free reign to the members on the site, there are many things you cannot discuss on InkPop without having [[trolls | members]] getting upset on the forums. Heaven forbid you mention religion as on InkPop GOD IS LOVING AND SEX IS TERRIBLE. Due to the website catering to [[Teenager| young adults]], open-mindedness is frowned upon as it promotes thinking outside the box. All in all, inkpop is filled with [[16 year old girls | sixteen-year-old girls]] like every other writing site ever.

==ONOEZ THEY'VE FOUND US!==

This article has recently come to the attention of members of inkpop and they are demanding that it be taken down.  Sources tell us that inkpoppers are horrible at taking jokes.  They also don't understand that ED does it for the [[lulz | lulz]] so pleads to take down the article or attempts to wipe it will [[fail | fail]].
