Ranging from [[Who was phone|retarded creepypasta]] and [[Great Mother|questionable gods]], there are many idiotic [[memes]] that originate from [[x/|/x/]] and its lurking [[dumbasses]]. <s>This one is no less [[retarded]] than the other ones.</s> You know the Grifter makes you scared like a little girl.

'''The Grifter Video''' can be categorized as an epic [[troll|trolling]] attempts which is always succesful. It serves as an [[Bullshit|urban legend]] in [[4chan|4chan's]] /x/ board. It is a rare video [not] on the internet, only that [[ALL CAPS|IT DOESN'T FUCKING EXIST]]. It is supposed to depict [[Goatse|shocking and disturbing contents]] which [[Swap.avi|psychologically traumatizes the viewer for the rest of his/her life]]. All of the Grifter Threads [[Over 9000|always]] contain whether [[Newfag|newfags]] asking for the video or oldfags [[RAGE|raging]] over it, always results in a [[Win|win/win]] situation and further [[Don't feed the trolls|troll feeding]]. But it is actually real.

==The Grifter Video==
Basically, The Grifter is the non exsistant [[final solution]] for trolling /x/. Never has a subject caused so much [[RAGE|anger]] and [[butthurt]], especially on /x/. The Grifter was made up by some [[faggot]] named [[tripfag|something that no one cares about and will be forgotten due to being such a dumb-fuck namefag]] as a lame [[troll]] (though it is rumored that [[Something Awful|SA goons]] may actually be behind it). The [[B|pros]] took it much further, though, spamming it into [[forced meme]] status within hours. The Grifter, essentially, is [[Perfection Girl]] gullibility meets the videotape from [[The Ring]] meets [[Girugamesh]] spam. However, this video still might left as a [[It_is_a_mystery|mystery]] as to just [[you|who]] is posting new threads about it every five minutes. 

The method is simple: Just make a new thread with any [[beecock|image]] and ask "hai guise, whar can i find the grifter?" or alternatively, "wut is da grifter?" This also acts as an alarm bell for any lurking [[trolls]], who will promptly come out and tell you that [[3_guys_1_hammer|the video is so disturbing]] that you certainly [[DO NOT WANT|don't want]] to see it. /x/ will then get extremely upset by these posts, defending that the video doesn't really exist in [[srsly|EVERY SINGLE THREAD]]. [[Samefag|Genuinely curious people]] may also inquire just what the video is about, to which [[Samefag|those who have seen the video]] will respond that it is much too [[Offended|disturbing]]. This furthers the wrath of [[/x/]], causing them to continue insisting The Grifter is a [[truth|hoax]]. Calls of "[[nice try]]" and "you guys just want to keep it to yourselves!" are appropriate at this point. If the thread gets stale, just make another for [[massive damage]]. If there's already five threads about it on the first page, don't worry about that. What will one [[moar|more]] hurt? In addition, it seems some /x/philes are actually willing to [[habeeb it|believe]] this [[shit]], adding approximately 1.5 times the amount of [[lulz]]. Impersonating the_solipsist (just use a random fake tripcode) is also advisable, as most of /x/ won't even notice.

==IT'S FOR REALZ!!!==

|The first time i unrar'ed the three compressed files, i got a video. i saw a few seconds, felt sick, deleted it. It was some fucked-up dude walking with his hands out in front of him, zombie style, no noise but the sound of his breath and what sounded like a heartbeat... then i saw a baby laying down, realized this green armed fucker was going towards it, thought of my own kid, and closed it|Zombies?|The Grifter is real. It is by far the most fucked up thing I've ever seen in my life, and I'm an avid gore looney. It was posted somewhat in mid 2008 first. It is the stuff nightmares are made of, creeps you out completely and cuts into your imagination like a razorblade. Most ppl I know have deleted it after seeing it once, only a good friend of mine, with whom I've started out exploring gorepits like ogrish or rotten.com has watched it multiple times. I'm not sure if his condition is derived entirely from that, but he's been in and out of a mental hospital ever since. Rumor has it this vid was created by a former mod of 4Chan at that time, who was booted soon afterwards. The x.datchan.org entry is pure fake to cover this up and transform it into some kind of urban legend, but the vid is still out there, and I guess at least some folks here at /b/ still have it on their HDs but will nevar link you to it|An [[Fag|avid gore looney]]|I've been researching this for a long time. There seem to be three versions of the video. One has all of the main events, but people who watch it aren't physically effected by it and forget about it eventually. Another one seems to have a few more seemingly benign frames (the swingset, the maggots in the sink) that have a huge effect on how the video "effects" people. I thought that was it, but there appears to be ANOTHER version thats edited and cropped to shit with some weird noises added, seems to have no effect also.

Believe me, I was fucking skeptical at first. But after seeing the second version of the video, its like this weird fearful feeling...like when you're a kid afraid of the boogie monster or whatever...a really strong, surreal fear. You really don't want to see this guys, just forget it|A [[Serious Business|researcher]]|it was posted back in 2007-8 under some foreign link, the OP basically posted the link stating how fucked up it was.

It was real grainy, from what i remember it showed strange images, like a bathtub full of writhing maggots, haunting paintings from old times melting, random forests,flashing colours, text in a different language (from what i remember) all while a strange voice played which sounded like a strange murmrer, if you've seen the 'there is nothing' video, it was like that voice but more indistinguishable.

Then the graininess lifted a little, and there was a video of a small puppy being held up by it's neck, it was moving like in pain but it's cries where like a human childs, it then cut to a nursery with lots of craddles all the children where still in the cots, presumed dead, it walked over to one of the cots, and one of the newborns raised up a little, began to cry, and bled from the eyes and mouth. then another shot of a basement (like the original picture) with a malformed hand disapearing into it blood stained.
Lastly it showed more text (someone 'stated' it said 'you're race is one that is dying') with an image of a plant rotting very quickly, close ups of corpses.
and what i can only describe as 'real' cases of exorcism and demonic posession, which clearly have never been seen outside the said country of origin.
while this seen plays, the voice that was talking fairly calmly, breaks out into screams of intense pain and suffering, which is just as deeply chilling as the initial shock.
