Like [http://www.dailypuppy.com/ The Daily Puppy] but to the reverse, The Drudge Report, is a conservative troll site run by semi-closeted conservative homosexual Matt DrudgeJew.   

As well as  showcasing shock images of scary liberals, the site also contains valuable information marked in '''red''', not to confuse the [[redneck|average IQ viewer]], with outrageous claims such as [[fact|"over 9000 aborted babies in China every DAY!"]]. When the information is this [[Retard|valuable]] it is usually presented in ALL CAPS. 

Matt DrudgeJew is most famous for exposing the [[Monica Lewinsky]] story, and for just being an all-around dickbag. Mostly, Drudge simply leaks rumors and half-facts, always with a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Republican]] angle.  More of an [[Attention Whore|attention whore]] than a political tool like [[Rush Limbaugh]], Drudge just wants people to notice him and buy high-cholesterol diet scheme ads from his site. 

The Drudge Report website is not so much a website as it is a Geocities page. A big mess of text links, bold fonts, AP culled photos, that only accidentally includes worthy news. His skills with HTML have been likened to those of a [[cat]], and his site is a close approximation of what most [[16-year-old girl]]s' websites would look like if not for [[MySpace]]. Rarely does Drudge post proper links to recognized news sources, and prefers instead to post vague semi-bombshells without really giving sources or further info.  He is also heavily [[Unwarranted self-importance|self-aggrandizing]], as evidenced by his hit counter (which is doubtlessly 46% neo-[[conservative]] dittoheads, 50% people like the author who are mocking him, and 4% [[furries]] waiting for him to come out of the closet) and a link to the [http://www.refdesk.com Drudge Reference Desk], which is actually an independent site in which he is not involved and which is probably mildly allergic to him.

Matt Drudge is now used as a source for more spectacularly unevolved [[conservatives]] (i.e. all of them) to prove points in lame internet debates. Usually used to support a one-liner, as follows:
:'''Doltasaur:''' ''HILARY CLINTON DID VIETNAM''
:'''Skeptic:''' ''Get back in your corner.''
:'''Doltasaur''' ''NO FOR REAL LOOK [http://drudgereport.com HERE] ITS FOR REAL''
:'''Skeptic:''' ''Get back in your corner.''

It is only a matter of time before a permutation of [[Godwin's Law]] is made for Matt Drudge.

==Drudge==
Matt DrudgeJew is well known among [[liberals]] for having attempted to assassinate [[Bill Clinton]] [[at least 100]] times so that he'd finally have some credibility among [[conservative]]s. His sheer [http://drudgereport.com ineptitude] led him to fail every time, usually resulting in [[furry]] [[rape]], arrest or both. He later attempted to [[fellatio|fellate]] [[Clinton]] in hopes for creating his first real news story, but confused [[Clinton]] with a toad and contracted [[herpes]] instead. He now simply throws cinder blocks at squirrels in hopes of being arrested and therefore being newsworthy. It hasn't worked.
