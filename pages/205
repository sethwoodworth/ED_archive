Acalamari
'''Acalamari''' is a [[Wikipedo]] admin who is really fucking [[anal]]. He is an [[English]] immigrant living on the East Coast of the [[United States]] of America, probably one of those states like [[New Hampshire]] where middle-class white people try to raise their kids in a sheltered environment and hide them from what [[some argue|they perceive]] to be the [[IRL|big, bad outside world]].

Since Acalamari is a huge [[faggot]], he is obsessed with [[female]] [[pop]] singers, and their shitty, shitty music. Among his favourite artists are Madonna, Pussycat Dolls, Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson, Shakira, Hillary Duff, and worst of all, Shania Twain; all of this information is publicly available on his userpage. Despite his music taste being worse than a gay [[Greek]] man like George Michael in a [[euro]]dance club on [[ecstasy]] in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotadic_zone sotadic zone] trying to find a young [[man]] to give it [[in the ass]] to by practising his meticulously rehearsed [[list of sex moves|choreographic movements]], he feels the need to strongly assert his [[heterosexual]]ity on his userpage, because he is clearly [[not gay]]. (But come on, seriously. A male Shania Twain ''fan''? ''Heterosexual''? [[LOL WUT]]!)

And, of course, as we all know, information about Shania Twain albums is more appealing to write about on Wikipedia than [[science]] or [[mathematics]].

Here is a quote from one of the many [[barnstar]]s on his userpage:

{{quote|For [[kill it with fire|lighting up]] Wikipedia with your ([[apparently]]) [[USI|legendary]] [[rape|love]] for editors of the fairer [[sex]], I, [[mantrain|A Train]] award you this [[unique Don Juan Barnstar]] on this, the 29th of March, 2007.|Some Wikifag}}

He is also a massive fan of dealing with [[Grawp]] vandalism. He loves to delete and salt every single pagemove title that Grawp makes, under the reason of "Grawp title", which is totally against '''[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Deny recognition|WP:DENY]]''', isn't it? That's just giving Grawp more infamy, but the stupid faggot that Acalamari is doesn't realise that. A good way to [[pwn]] Wikipedia would be to do Grawp-style vandalism, but move articles to titles that are redlinked in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MISSING WikiProject Missing Encylopedia Articles], so that the stupid [[cunt]] here actually protects potentially notable articles from ever being created, [[lol]], denying Wikipedia's Did You Know? section of some of its potential content.

He is extremely preoccupied with being liked by everyone, and has a pathological need for validation from other Wikipedians. In fact, one might say that other than minor spelling fixes, the only thing Acalamari does on Wikipedia is socializing and doing things he thinks will make others like him. He randomly hands out the "rollback" privilege to people, and his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Acalamari talk page] consists almost entirely of "thank you" notes for giving people rollback, or supporting them in their RfA (Acalamari doesn't have the guts to oppose anyone), or nominating them for adminship with a sugary-sweet nomination statement. He has had WikiCrushes on several female Wikpedians, including [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Persian_Poet_Gal Persian Poet Gal], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Natalie_Erin Natalie Erin] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Phaedriel Phaedriel], but due to his [[Nice Guy]] attitude, his approaches have failed.

In 2009 some shitty tabloid published a story about him and [[Fellatio|his activities on TOW]], with his [[Dox|IRL name, pix and stuff]] but [[Nobody cares|nobody bothered to add it here]].
