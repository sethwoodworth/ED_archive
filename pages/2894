{{quote|The most powerful people on the Internet don't work for Microsoft, Google or the government. Rather, they're a bunch of antisocial, foul-mouthed, clever nerds who congregate at a [[facepalm|largely unknown]] Web site called 4chan.org.|Faux News, about [[4chan]], [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,512957,00.html srsly].}}

'''Faux News''' (also known by its [[gullible|cult]] [[Christian|worshipers]], '''Fox News''') is a comedy network for [[gullible]] [[Retards|Republicans]], [[white trash]], [[bitches]], and [[13-year-old boys]]. Of course, [[Some Argue|one could argue]] that Fox News is really just a huge [[troll]], but it's unlikely, seeing as they take everything so fucking [[Serious Business|seriously]], as evidenced by the fact that Fox is one of the biggest sources of drama on teh [[internets]] since [[Bush]] stole the election [[last Thursday]]. Countless blogs and political commentary websites erupt into debate over the latest musings of [[Sean Hannity]] or that [[shemale]] [[Ann Coulter]] featured on the network. It is now popularly known that [[MSNBC]] is now the primary source for [[furries|Furfags]], seeing that Faux nooz is filled right wing [[ass-hats]] that oppress sexual tendencies and thoughts that they have and express [[uber]] uselessness over it. 

Fox News is mostly dominated by traitorous Irish bastards, since sober minorities, a.k.a. not the Irish, would kill themselves when realizing that they are, indeed, working for Faux Nooz. 

It is rumored that the new logo of Fox News will be a triptych of the Virgin Mary crying in a glass of Miller Lite while shoving a potato up her cunt.

[[Christianhillbilly]] gets his [[facts]] from Fox News ([[moar]] liek Fox JEWs, [[amirite]]?). [[Some argue]] that [[Rupert Murdoch]] is in fact Jew (and everyone acknowledges that he serves Zionist interests), and [[Jews did WTC|did WTC]] to generate [[Lulz|lulzy]] footage for his news empire to replay [[over 9000]] times in any given week. [[terrorists|Foreigners]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] hate Fox News because Fox covers [[liberals]] and [[terrorists]] getting [[raped]] by real men with guns. [[some argue|Supporters of Fox argue]] that the  network simply reports the rape, and allows its viewers to decide if the victims were [[asking for it]].

If this is the best we can throw at them, then it's clear why these pricks prevail.

== Fox [[Fail|tries]] to shield Sarah Palin from booing crowd ==

[[Sarah Palin]]'s latest political stunt was to reinforce her "hockey mom" image by [[shit nobody cares about|dropping the first puck at a hockey game in Philadelphia]]. Anticipating bad press from the get go, Faux News website released the following statement:

{{quote| The GOP Vice-Presidential nominee said at an earlier fundraiser that she would stop some of the booing from the rowdy Philadelphia fans by putting her [[loli|seven year old daughter]], Piper in a Flyers jersey. She said, "How dare they boo Piper!" | Sarah Palin, [[Bullshit|showing just how good a mother she is]]}}

The plan [[doing it wrong|backfired]], and the boos were so loud the stadium [[failed|tried]] to drown it out by turning up the music. That did little however to distract from the [[lulz|numerous thumbs-down gestures and Obama/Biden signs in the audience]]. And when the time came, Palin didn't even drop the puck herself.
<center><youtube>g7TgDanmWkg</youtube></center>
Faux News for their part tried to polish this turd by splicing together overhead footage that cut out the audience and using crappy audio that drowned out most of the booing.

==Fox News: Saving the World One Vidya at a Time==
[[Image:Full frontal mass effect.jpg|thumb|300px|HELP! I'M BEING DESENSITIZED! ALL WOMEN ARE OBJECTS OF DESIRE, AND I DESIRE SEX FROM THEM! MY DEVELOPING MIND CANNOT HANDLE THE MATURE SITUATIONS IN THIS GAME! WHO AM I?! WHAT AM I?! HALP ME FAUX NEWS! SAVE ME FROM A NEVER ENDING SPIRAL OF NAUGHTY THOUGHTS!]]   

The biggest threat to a god-fearing, fag-hating nation, aside from terrorists, liberals, liberal-terrorists, and atheist heathens, is the vidya. [[Jack Thompson]] is a prime candidate when it comes to providing completely unreliable "research" that the reason your little boy raped a girl, stole a car, and murdered a number of people is not due to bad parenting, but because of a video game where he repeatedly pressed the X button. But we're not talking about any hack-lawyer who needs to be put into a retirement home this time, we're talking about a hack-psychiatrist named [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKzF173GqTU Cooper Lawrence]. Dr. Lawrence (not a real doctor, but a doctor in the same way that Dr Pepper or Dr Dre is a doctor) appeared on Fox News to discuss the psychological harm that can be induced by the popular vidya "Mass Effect". Surely, they're going to discuss the harmful xenophobic effects of fighting a universally evil alien race, right? Of creating lines between 'us' and 'them' based on appearance rather than values and actions? Fuck that hippie bullshit. Faux News is going to discuss the three minutes of [[awesome|DIGITAL, FULL FRONTAL, TOTALLY EXPLICIT, FILTHY, UNNATURAL, MIND-CORRUPTING NUDITY!]] Seriously, they compared the Xbox 360 (at the time with a lower survival rate than a black man at a Klan-Nazi pancake breakfast) to Pandora's Box ([[Television|the box that unleashed corrupting evil to humanity]]). Cooper gave her two cents about "all the research" and how teenagers with their Play-Dough minds see women as objects of desire.  Amazingly, the smartest person there was from Spike TV, Geoff Keighley, who not only got Cooper to say that she never actually played Mass Effect, but that there was only a bit of alien side-boob, AND that you actually needed to build a relationship before there's even a chance to get any tail, while Cooper seemed adamant that every female encounter in the game included a 'Press X to Rape' command option. [[Epic Win|And thus it was proven that a well-known news station can be ousted intellectually by a channel dedicated to James Bond marathons, softcore porn-based comedy, and UFC.]] As Keighley tried to explain that nothing being said was true about the content of the game, and it was all blatant lies and bullshit, Faux News decided to cut off the liberal-fag-loving-terrorist, and went back to raging about children playing porn games. And then when they had their little moralistic circle-jerk about how awful it is, they all acted as if Geoff hadn't spoken at all.

Normally this kind of bullshit ends as a never-ending nerd rage on YouTube, but a few days later, Cooper Lawrence got her just desserts on Amazon.com. Gamers calling Cooper on her bullshit flocked to wherever a review of her latest book "''[http://www.amazon.com/Cult-Perfection-Making-Peace-Overachiever/dp/1599211793 The Cult of Perfection: Making Peace with Your Inner Overachiever]''" could be deposited, and proceeded to ruin her reputation as a person with any amount of intelligence. Honestly, would you want to buy a self-help book from a person who makes arguments without research? Or take advice from someone stupid enough to insult an interest of the interwebs (video games) and imply the evil of another (porn), then try and market her book immediately thereafter? It's like murdering someone in front of their family, then giving them a business card that has your name, address, and closest friends and treasured valuables listed in case you want to exact revenge while expecting them to send you gift baskets that *don't* include explosives.

Amazon has since taken off all the reviews that stated they hadn't read the book. But, it turns out the book's crappy enough, even without [[nerd rage]], and over 100 people still give it a 1/5 rating, while four people were paid enough to give it a 5/5 rating.[http://www.amazon.com/Cult-Perfection-Making-Peace-Overachiever/product-reviews/1599211793/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_summary?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending Sample here.]
===EA UNLEASHES THE FURY===

After the interview [[Electronic Arts|EA]] executives called out Fox News's [[bullshit]] debate with an [[ALL CAPS]] letter debunking the lies that where [[shit|spoken]]. Basically the letter defended the hundred of [[nerd]]s who put in [[last Thursday|years]] to make this game. [http://kotaku.com/348187/ea-calls-fox-out-on-insulting-mass-effect-inaccuracies]

{{quote|<small><small>The resulting coverage was insulting to the men and women who spent years creating a game which is acclaimed by critics for its high creative standards. As video games continue to take audiences away from television, we expect to see more TV news stories warning parents about the corrupting influence of interactive entertainment. But this represents a new level of recklessness.
Do you watch the Fox Network? Do you watch Family Guy? Have you ever seen The OC? Do you think the sexual situations in Mass Effect are any more graphic than scenes routinely aired on those shows? Do you honestly believe that young people have more exposure to Mass Effect than to those prime time shows?

[[serious business|This isn't a legal threat; it's an appeal to your sense of fairness. We're asking FNC to correct the record on Mass Effect.]]</small></small>|Jeff Brown, VP of EA}}

Result: EA does [[EPIC]] [[PWNAGE]] on Fox and is, for the first and last time in the history of the world, the good guy.
===Update: The [[Cunt]] Apologizes===

So after receiving a lot of [[shit|flak]] from all corners of the [[nerd|gaming world]] and from having much [[butthurt]] on [[porn|amazon]], the [[cunt]] actually decides to watch someone else play the game for two and a half hours. She then realizes that she's fucking retarded, because [[you|who could get off watching an alien bone a human?]][http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/26/arts/television/26mass.html] [http://www.destructoid.com/fox-psychologist-admits-she-was-wrong-check-the-skies-for-flying-pigs-66917.phtml]

{{quote|I recognize that I misspoke. I really regret saying that, and now that I’ve seen the game and seen the sex scenes it’s kind of a joke. Before the show I had asked somebody about what they had heard, and they had said it’s like pornography. But it’s not like pornography. I’ve seen episodes of Lost that are more sexually explicit.|Cooper 'Pretentious Cunt' Lawrence, still managing to be insulting during her apology. An exemplar of the Faux Way.}} 

Despite apologizing to the [[gaming]] community for all of the bullshit accusations, the [[rape]] over her book on amazon shall continue to prove a lesson to the people at faux news and anyone who goes on who makes any false accusations and promoting a book at the same time, will feel the [[shit nobody cares about|wrath of the gaming community]].

==Faux News Shoops Photos==
[[Image:Fox news shoops liberals.jpg|thumb|[[This looks shooped]]...]]
On July 2, 2008, everyone's favorite propaganda hate machine ran a segment calling ''New York Times'' editor and reporter Steven Reddicliffe and Jacques Steinberg "attack dogs," because they mentioned that [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/28/arts/television/28rati.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Fox News' ratings were slipping], probably because people don't want to be fed bullshit during the presidential elections. Fox thought this statistical data was an attack on their [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|fair and unbalanced]] news coverage, so they counter-attacked the ''New York Times'' by having a circle-jerk about how Reddicliffe was fired from Fox, makes less money now working for the ''New York Times'', and wrote the report because he hates Fox, and additionally, Fox [http://mediamatters.org/items/200807020002 posted altered photos of the two reporters] to give them Jew noses, yellow teeth, receding hairlines, and darkened circles around their eyes. Showing the average intelligence of people who get their news from Fox, because who wants to get news from ugly people?

==Taking on Fark==
On August 17, 2007, Fox News attempted to [[hacker|h4x0r]] [[Fark]] and steal their internets. [http://valleywag.com/tech/exclusive/fark-founder-accuses-fox-newsman-of-hacking-290286.php] However, since Fox's crack team of internet counter-hate machines is made up of people who regularly get pwned by [[script kiddies]], they got absolutely nowhere and failed so hard that Rupert Murdoch crapped lazers.

== Still "Fair and Balanced"  ==
Proving they're still a [[fucktarded|well informed]] [[no|news organization]], the Fox 11 report on January 31st, 2008, aimed at "cyber-bullying," included more [[fucktarded|top notch]] news reporting about the [[Goatse|dangers of the internet]]. Most of the examples are retarded idiots who can't deal with anyone pointing out the truth of how much of a fag they really are, who then make up shit and go to Faux news for a chance at popularity.

==Keep Fucking that Chicken==
[[Image:DariAlexander.png|right|thumb|[[LOLWUT]]?]]
[[Image:Kfcchikkins.gif|right|thumb|Anastos on the job]]
This phrase was coined by Faux News anchor '''Ernie Anastos''' during a [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Keep%20fucking%20that%20chicken&defid=4242406  live broadcast] of the [[New York]] local news.
{{tinyquote|It takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick. '''Keep fucking that chicken'''.}}
<center>{{frame|{{fv|Fuckin||font-weight: bold;|<youtube>ss8LDBNcsWc</youtube>|<youtube>yExhzotEu4s</youtube>|<youtube>vQTd0t-Pxck</youtube>}}}}</center>

The quote was an obvious rip-off of [[chikins]] producer [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Perdue Frank Perdue's] original catchphrase, ''"It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken"'', which went [[Fail|badly wrong]] when Anastos tried to use it. The original Perdue campaign also generated unintentional [[lulz]] when the [[Mexico|Mexican]] translation of their catchphrase ended up telling people, ''"It takes a hard man to get your '[[cock|chicken]]' aroused"'' ("polla" meaning 'dick' in Spanish). It's pretty obvious that Anastos meant this version.

At least now we know what [[KFC]] stands for.

==Fox News vs Sesame Street==

In November, 2009, [[Sesame Street]] included [http://www.dailyfinance.com/2009/11/05/fox-news-v-sesame-street-beck-oreilly-fans-angry-over-oscar/ an old skit] where [[ODB|Oscar the Grouch]] gets into an argument over his liberal news show resulting in a caller telling him she's switching to watching '''Pox News'''. This -naturally- caused immediate butthurt at the official [[propaganda|'news' channel]] of the Republican Party prompting [[Papa Bear]] O'Reilly to return fire at Sesame Street.
