Fag trap
A '''fag trap''' is an [[instant messaging]] technique where you get someone to essentially admit to being a [[gay]], then posting it for friends and relatives to see, thereby [[pwn]]ing them. Usually done for [[lulz]] or [[great justice]].

== Example ==

: '''homogay1991:''' hey is this mike?
: '''thisismike:''' yeah this is mike, whos this
: '''homogay1991:''' john, i added u on [[Failbook|FB]] too
