What rigorous conditioning makes a religious leader perfect for the papacy? Killing some motherfucking [[jews]]. Currently Benedict XVI has that shit on lock. In 1941, our good friend was [[holocaust|ethnic cleansing]] with [[Hitler|the best of them]], lulzing it up in the Hitler Youth. I mean, they had it coming right? If killing Christ and doing WTC isn't grounds for genocide, '''WHAT THE FUCK IS'''?

He knows his god is always right, and is ready to defend any crusaders in history, essentially saying that the Spanish conversion and extermination of south and central america was ok because they did it to spread Catholocism

And guess what job he had before he was Pope? [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4445279.stm He was head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith - the Inquisition].

During Easter '09, some [[bitch]] gave him what he deserved and punched him in the FACE! His [[Special forces|Swiss Guard]] security pimps subsequently raeped her and dumped her corpse in a garbage bin. Boy, nothing says you trust God like 16 heavily armed bodyguards!
