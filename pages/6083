Orson Scott Card


{{spoiler|[[fanfic|Ender's Game]] was a reference to [[Hitler]]}}


[[Image:Orson_Scott_Card_snuggle.JPG|thumb|Lookin' [[gay|dandy]] there Orson.]]



When [[Mormons]] write [[science fiction]] books riddled with references to [[Hitler]], and actually [[you win the prize|win some prizes]] for it, you know there's something seriously fucked up in the world. 
Enter '''Orson Scott [[card crusher|Card]]''', an [[american|americunt]], who also happens to be a [[conservative]] [[redneck|political activist]], [[politics|public speaker]], [[retard|critic]] and a devout worshipper of [[mormon|Brigham Young]]. Card is also among the [[concerned mother|good]] [[creationist|members]] of the [[fundie|National Organization for Marriage]]. 

Did I mention his Jew founded the first [[canada|Canadian]] [[waco|Mormon settlement]], and the he [[dubious disclaimer|claims]] to be directly related to the Mormon Jesus? 

He also [[haet|haets]] [[homosexuality|teh gheys]], as if a [[conservative]] [[Mormon]] [[fundamentalist]] [[retard|would think otherwise]], [[amirite]]?



==At least 100 years ago==



[[Image:PopeNiggaPlease.jpg|thumb|right|The Pope's [[GTFO|reaction to Orson's work]].]]




Orson Scott Card first broke out of his cocoon in Richland, [[Washington]], were he lived his early life as a Mormon [[starcraft|zergling]] with his [[parents|Hydralisks]]. They would move to [[california|Santa Clara]], eventually ending up in [[redneck|Utah]]. Later he served as a [[spy|missionary]] for the [[Westboro_Baptist_Church|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], and eventually he [[blowjob|sucked]] his way up to graduation from the [[college|Brigham Young University]] and the University of Utah, and he also spent a whole year at the [[france|University of Notre Dame]], a private [[Catholic]] university in Australia, but eventually [[fail|failed it]]. This is at least a bit [[irony|ironic]] since the [[pope|catholic church]] has [[pwn|condemned]] the Mormons' [[incest|incestuous]], [[pedophile|pedophiliac]] orgies [[over 9000|many times]] in the last few years.


It doesn't take much imagination to realize why a [[fucktard|Mormon fundamentalist]] would [[epic fail|fail so hard]] on a university with [[The_Spanish_Inquisition|such a background]].

==Early Life as a [[cunt|Writer]]==



Orson began his writing career as a [[fag|poet]], studying with his [[BFF]] [[nazi|Clinton F. Larson]] at the [[columbine|Brigham Young University]]. While he was majoring in [[old media|theatre]], he began [[piracy|adapting]] works of fiction for theatre productions, because he couldn't write shit by himself ([[fact|and probably still can't]]), eventually accumulating enough [[copypasta]] to write his own, one act play. At the same time, he began [[science|experimenting]] with writing [[slash|fiction]], which would later lead to the creation of some [[shit nobody cares about]].

[[Image:Bible_warning.jpg|thumb|left|Orson's first [[bible|work of fiction]].]]

After returning from his [[LSD|LDS]] [[hookers and blow|mission]] in [[Brazil]], converting lots of young [[shota]] meat to his [[cult]], for use in [[rape|rituals]], he created the [[drama|Utah Valley Repertory Theatre Company]]. He managed to Jew some old building behind a [[lol|mental hospital]], were they [[bukkake|performed to the audience]]. This was a very [[I See What You Did There|clever]] manuoever of him, because who else would watch a [[pr0n|play]] written by a Mormon, other then people who have a few [[asspie|brain cells missing]] or are [[Tom Cruise|a bit off the normal mental health scale]]? Maybe [[you]].

In [[at least 100 years ago|1976]], he [[blowjob|secured employment]] as an assistant editor at the [[God Hates Fags|Church's official magazine]] and moved to the [[East_High_School_Salt_Lake_City|Mormon Mecca]].

While working on the magazine, he also published his first work of fiction, but [[noone|no one]] noticed because anyone who reads a magazine about [[religion]] is so used to [[bible|fictional bullshit]] that they [[schizophrenia|don't see the difference anymore]].


==Ender's Game==

[[Image:Ender's_game.jpg|thumb|right|You know there's something wrong [[unwarranted self importance|when the author's name is bigger then the book's own name]].]]

During the early years of his [[shit|career]], Card [[cum|came]] up with his first work of [[science fiction]]: A novel about a [[v|/v/irgin]] playing a [[video game|vydia gaem]] which was created to [[Call of Duty 4|train him to war]]. According to his [[retards|fans]], it is a [[no|wprk of science fiction genius]], but to the [[EDiot|informed, intelligent citizens]] among us, it's a huge load of [[shit]] mashed up together with [[over 9000]] references to [[Hitler]], and why we should forgive him for [[holocaust|skinning a bunch of Jews alive]]. No, [[srsly|really]].

The book is set in [[rapture|Earth's future]], apparently the brave forces of the [[warhammer|imperium of man]] have been throughly [[pwned]] by a Jew also known as [[British Scum|"the buggers"]]. In preparation for an anticipated [[zerg rush|third invasion]], some [[azn|foreign]] school has created a [[ASCII|program]] to train [[13 year old boy|children]] into [[Admiral_Ackbar|able fleet commanders]]. [[indigo|The world's most talented children]], including the novel's protagonist [[emo|Ender]] [[wang|Wiggin]], are taken at a [[shota|very young age]] to a training facility in the [[florida|middle of nowhere]] known as the [[/k/|battle school]]. There, they are [[raped|trained]] by their [[hax0r|teachers]] in the [[DDOS|arts of war]] through increasingly difficult [[portal|games]] including ones undertaken in [[sinistar|zero gravity]] in the [[VTEC_Just_Kicked_In_Yo|Battle Room]] where [[asspie|Ender's tactical genius]] is revealed. 

Eventualy they end up establishing a Mormon boot camp on the [[japan|alien world]], just to find out they were long gone [[fail|before they even arrived]], but they find an [[zombaby|unborn Formian queen]] which [[CWC|Ender]] can communicate through [[ESP|telepathy]]. The queen tells him how the Formians saw the [[pain series|true nature of humanity]] and [[adult baby|shat their pants]] over it, eventualy disbanding. He [[unwarranted self importance|realizes they left this queen behind for him to find]], and find out the [[pussy|Formians]] just [[nobody gives a shit|stopped caring]] and went home to their aunties and uncles in [[bel-air|another world]].

Apparently, according to some [[troll|distinguished individuals]], Card makes an apology to Hitler, and with the last bit, how [[holocaust|all the killing]] is forgivable because he was just doing it to [[aryan|protect his people]]. This is of course wrong because it's not forgivable because he was trying to protect his peers, but because he was trying to rid the world of the Jew.

==Religion==

[[Image:She's_14.jpg|thumb|right| Mormons [[loev|<3]] [[loli]].]]

As it has been mentioned [[over 9000]] times already, Orson Scott Card is a [[Mormon]], but not any kind of Mormon. He claims to be descended from the founders of the Mormon church itself, despite the fact there being [[fact|no visible evidence of such thing]].

This is only [[lol|laughable]], because who would go as far as [[lie|lying]] just to say he descends from a [[fat]], greasy, [[scat|shit ridden]], Jew [[indie|archeologist]] who claimed to the [[science|scientific community]] to have found [[loldongs|magical relics]]?

Card is also [[pwn|criticised]] by his [[retards|Mormon peers]] for writing science fiction, because everyone knows all Mormons are [[creationists]], which is even [[moar]] [[irony|ironic]] since all the other [[illuminati|Christian churches]] never get tired of pointing out that Mormons corrupted the [[lol|Bible's teachings]] into [[lulz|different ideas]] just so they could marry [[loli|lolis]] and have delishus orgies with their [[at least 100|multiple]], [[domestic violence|softned up]], [[kitchen|kitchen]] dwelling [[redneck]] wives.

He also uses his religious background to justify his endless [[haet]] for teh [[gay|gheys]]

==On [[Homosexuality]]==

Like any [[fundie|Christian fundamentalist]], Card [[DO NOT WANT|cannot bear]] the fact [[fags|godless sodomites]] are eventualy going to have the [[hookers and blow|same rights as him]]. However, unlike the good members of the [[god hates fags|Westboro Baptist Church]], who express [[h8|their feelings]] towards the [[buttsecks]] loving folk in an [[lulz|entertaining]] way, instead Card, like all Mormons, tries to sound serious while doing it, causing everybody to find them [[unfunny]] and [[nobody gives a shit|stop caring]] about [[bullshit|what they say]].

{{quote|No matter how [[fetish|sexually attracted]] a [[fag|man]] might be toward other [[you|men]], or a [[dyke|woman]] toward other [[your mom|women]], and no matter how [[buttsecks|close]] the bonds of [[love|affection and friendship]] might be within [[gay|same-sex]] [[BFF|couples]], there is no act of [[internet court|court]] or [[internet law|Congress]] that can make these [[buttsecks|relationships]] the same as the [[rape|coupling]] between a [[cock|man]] and a [[cunt|woman]]. This is a [[lie|permanent fact]] of [[IRL|nature]].|Orson Scott Card|Besides sounding like a good ol' intolerant [[Mormon]], and not realizing nobody would ever take a [[lulz|Mormon fundamentalist science fiction writer]] seriously, he also shows he knows nothing of the US legal system.}}

[[TL;DR]] we're better then fags cause we [[jam it in]] [[vagoo|vagoos]] instead of [[Stick It In Her Pooper|sticking it in the pooper]].

==[[OTI|On The Internet]]==

Unsurprisingly, like [[Harlan Ellison|other science fiction writers]], Orson Scott Card is also involved in a fair amount of internet drama, including, but not limited to, [[youtube]] [[faggotry]]:

<center>Orson, seen here talking about a contest created by [[Hubbard|L Ron Hubbard]] to help [[asspie|young writers]] publish their works.</center>
<center><youtube>YGs3Ch_im9c</youtube></center>


<center>Talking about his book for [[vomit|your viewing pleasure]]</center>
<center><youtube>mHmESnuz6bs</youtube></center>


<center>Talking about a [[unfunny|boring]] sequel for a saga he hasn't touched for [[old media|10 years]].</center>
<center><youtube>vHauK0eQWbw</youtube></center>


The [[internets|interbutts]] is not only the place where his critics and ex-fans express [[do not want|their feelings]] for his work, but also were his [[deep thinker|colleagues]] describe his [[fail|true nature]]:

''Taken from a [[kuro5hin]] article found here -> [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/5/28/22428/7034]''. <- Read it, [[srsly]]

{{quote|Earlier I said that there was a sense that [[violence|bad things]] happen to people who [[troll|cross]] [[fag|Orson Scott Card]]. A few months after the [[truth|FR article]] appeared and the [[rape|mini-shitstorm]] [[cum|spent itself]], [[whore|Elaine]] got an [[bait|invitation]] to appear as a guest at a [[convention|local science fiction convention]]. The invite specifically mentioned [[LOL|"doing something about all this Fascism in science fiction."]] [[DO NOT WANT|She wasn't really sure about it]], so she [[friend zone|asked me to go with her.]]

So we drove to a nearby city and did the [[blowjob|honored guest thing]], drinking the free [[alcohol|booze]] and [[OM NOM NOM NOM|eating]] the free [[food|munchies]] throughout the day. The [[cum|culmination]] of the evening was a party in [[pedophile|Robert Adams]]' suite. I had never heard of Adams, but he wrote a fairly popular [[gay|manly-man]] [[rape]] & Jew [[fantasy]] series called [[furfag|"Horseclans."]] He was there with another SF writer whose name [[fail|you would recognize less]] from his SF than from a popular column he wrote for a [[nerd|computer magazine]].

As [[Admiral Ackbar]] might have warned us, it was a [[trap]]. We did not know that Adams and his friend had a [[fetish|fondness]] for what one might call [[rape|physical entertainment]], and that I had been volunteered to be their [[domestic violence|punching bag]] for the evening. One of the organizers tried to warn [[retard|Elaine]] but [[you|I]] was [[drugs|buzzed]] and [[fun|having a good time]] and I was in no mood to leave.

Suddenly, the [[Street Fighter|crowd parted and I was grabbed]] and I found myself staring, [[douchebag|drink in one hand and other hand in pocket]], at [[internet tough guy|Robert Adams]] as he [[falcon punch|drew back his fist]]. I was barely registering that I was about to be [[pwn|punched]] when, at odds of more than 8 million to one, I was rescued. Specifically, [[a challenger appears|Elaine placed herself between Adams and me]]. [[lolwut|Adams showed no sign of holding his punch]], but the crowd which had [[obvious|obviously]] been quite [[win|willing to watch me take it]] [[fail|did not seem to be quite so willing]] to watch him [[fat|whale away]] on a [[girl]].

The fans pulled Adams back and the [[circlejerk|convention organizers]] [[stupid|sensibly responded]] by [[lolwut|kicking Elaine and me out of the convention]]. Which was just as well; she shortly [[an hero|quit]] SFWA and science fiction in general and went on to explore [[kitchen|other avenues]]. [[pussy|I have never been to another SF convention]] and I seriously doubt she has, either.
