[[Image:Raimyusame.gif|thumb|Same shit; Different colors]]


[http://raimyu.deviantart.com/ Raimyu] joined [[deviantart]] to show off her piece of [[shit]] [[animu]] art which within weeks made her OMG POPULAR. Obviously an [[Attention Whore]], she continues to consistantly produce the same picture every time refusing to improve and in fact getting worse thanks to her enablers/[[fangirl|fans]]. Raimyu is TOTALLY ORIGINAL GAIZ and is a [[lie|real artist]]. Raimyu gets SO ANNOYED at those who call her [[Amuria]]. All of her accusers are [[lulz|retarded]] as she's totally got a different style and isn't shiny desu @w@

== I LOVE AMU- I MEAN RAIMYU  - NO I MEAN RAMY ==

{{quote|People, who actually like my art but who's just stupid?|Raimyu}}
Raimyu hates her fans and has little respect for them. The very people who got her popular in the first place with their [[weeaboo|kawaii desus]] mean little to nothing to her. Her fans praise her coloring style and ability to draw yet she throws it back in their faces by disabling comments and essentially telling them to fuck off and die when they still note her with praises. It seems Raimyu can't take compliments.

We're sorry [[Amuria|Raimyu]] that DA annoys you so much and your watchers are so idiotic when they praise you. We're sorry that they think you're omg-so-special. Enjoy your [[AIDS]]. Check out RamyÂ´s old images and notice the same hair shading as Raimyu, odd I do not think so. :D

P.S. Screenshot the hell out of her before she [[delete fucking everything|deletes fucking everything]].

== The 'Art' ==

[[Image: Onesizefitsall.jpg|thumb|Wut? They're srsly different!]]
[[Image: Raimyulazy.jpg|thumb| Cause I'm lazy @w@]]
[[Image: LOLhand.PNG|thumb| With commissions like this, even [[KawaiiNekoGirl]] could sell shit on Gaia.]]

Raimyu through her shiny [[shit]] has become more and moar popular on DeviantART. How to do shiny @w@:
* Draw a bullshit sketch. Better yet trace a previous one only just change a few details. Your idiot fans will never notice.
* Line it sloppily with no skill whatsoever. After all who cares about how it's drawn. It's about SHINY.
* Color in quickly, use some shitty gradients and then put them all on overlay for EXTRA SHINY. Overlay is the new dodge @w@
* Don't forget the shitty patterns!  It's useful for when you're even too lazy to add your shitty ass shading!
* Rarely draw anything lower than the waist. If you do you're spending too much time and you've gotta put out two shitty pictures per day [[amirite]]?
* Always make your artwork look the same and never improve. Who cares about artistic worth when you have SHINY.

Rinse. Wash. Repeat.

Unfortunately, the admins are incredibly retarded. So retarded that they gave Raimyu a DD for her shiney diarrhea. [http://raimyu.deviantart.com/art/My-hero-60989713 How in God's name did this happen??]

{{quote|I wish I could [[fuck|hug]] Optimus Prime too, that's why [[An Hero|My hero]] by [[Amuria|*Raimyu]] got into my [[cunt|heart]], and of course the care in [[shit|details]] that Raimyu put into this picture. Soft and Shiny!

{{quote|seems Rai is my OC (original character) now <3 In real life I wear most of these purple/lavender+green stuff so she's kinda ME o.o But not at all!! She's "how I feel of myself"... yeah, so lame|Raimyu}}

Raimyu like all other [[weeaboo|animutards]] believes she is this [[internet disease| beautiful, magical, perfect girl]]. Hers of course is a purple haired marysue named of course Raimyu. She's totally like her because she has purple hair too! OMG!

== Transformers: More than meets the desu @w@ ==
[[Image:Notagain5.jpg|thumb|right|Not this shit again]]

Being the [[sick fuck]] that she is and many [[weeaboo]]s are Raimyu decided to rape the fandom of Transformers. Instead of being machines she has "transformed" them into humans and [[rape|raped]] the characters to death. This means constant [[yaoi]] to be able to get her jollys. This is includes but is not limited to constant Bee and Optimus Prime yaoi, implying sex, Bee [[faggot|crossdressing]], and the ever common kissing pictures.

== The Fuckbuddy ==
[[Image: Fuckbuddyrai.jpg|thumb| And the cavalry is called in]]

Of course on deviant one [[hack]] loves another. This being the case of [[i-heart-hikaru|Celestial-Heaven]] and Raimyu. If anyone touches her [[emo]] lover [[i-heart-hikaru|Celestial-Heaven]] will defend her without fail no matter if the commenter is flaming Raimyu or not. If someone disagrees with how Raimyu acts of course it's [[faggot|"OMG YOU DUN KNOW RAI-RAI"]]. As more people comment on her page expect more [[lulz|lulzy]] defending from [[i-heart-hikaru|Celestial-Heaven]] her "NUMBA 1 FAN!!"

== Criticism ==
Upon telling Raimyu that her [[cum|shiny]] [[weeaboo]] garbage looks like every other [[animu]]
and giving her work serious critique, one can see the [[irony|true intelligence of her fanbase]]. Go ahead and try it yourself, avoid [[Ad hominem]] and insults, make a clear concise comment about how generic and derivative her work looks, sit back and watch the [[lulz|pretty]] [[zippocat|fireworks]]. Here are some prime examples of her fucktards [[Paraphilia|defending]] her.

== PORN HAX0RZ? ==

Whether it's Raimyu herself (in a desparate plot for pageviews), one of her disenchanted little fanlings, or just some ED-ian who finally got up the nerve, Raimyu's been 'hacked'.
