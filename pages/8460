'''Tom Serson''' (T.C. Serson) is a clearly [[Canadian]] vlogger, [[notable]] only for being one of the most [[failed]] "trolls" in [[YouTube]] history.   

Serson is YouTube's poster-boy for [[trying too hard]]. He's made surgical efforts to propagandize himself as a "troll" on YouTube but as you can see by the existence of the article, he's fucked it up just a little. Notorious for his epic [[footbullet]]s, he's a high-school dropout with a [[Partyvan|criminal]] past who dreams of escaping his [[white trash|backwoods]] upbringing, his <s>dead-end job</s> (lol fired), the constant reminders of his [[low-life|mediocrity]], and most of all, [[e-fame|hitting it big]] on the tubes. The few people familiar with this [[wigger]]'s extensive faggotry know him mostly for [[spam]]ming asinine music videos and "[[stop posting|commentary]]" vlogs about whatever his [[pot|drug]]-addled brain can expound at any given time, and his lulzy fights with trolls on the tubes. A long-time sufferer of chronic [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|USI]], he believes [[TL;DW|8 minute]] videos of himself dancing to music will lead him to a "[[hookers and blow|big break]]" someday - sort of like most random YouTube [[camwhores]] (although they're usually [[cumdumpster|female]], and tend to acquire more than [[SNCA|20 viewers]]).  A [[stupid|diminished capacity]] from years of [[pot|substance abuse]], he enjoys [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT?|scribbling]] garbled [[engrish]] about things that [[noone]] cares enough about to try and decrypt, engaging in epic [[sockpuppet]] faggotry with those he's [[butthurt]] about, [[stalking]] girls online, and serving coffee at the local [[diabeetus|Tim Hortons]].

==A [[tl;dr|Brief]] History of Faggotry==
[[Image:suspended_lol.JPG|frame|right|220px|Clearly [[asking for it]].]]
[[Image:TomTimHortons.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Tom can still be found serving coffee somewhere in the Ottawa area, dreaming of that big break.]]

Proof [[Pareto's Principle]] pays off, Serson has provided lulz for one and all, establishing himself as one of YouTube's biggest low-rent [[lolcows]] as a result of his marked ability to consistently [[Questionable logic|equate perseverance with winning]], unable to fully comprehend the circus he has become. Tom has has been on the YouTube's [[banned|permaban]] list almost as long as he's been on the tubes. This is because he once mouthed off to the wrong person and ended up getting his YouTube channel [[phish|grabbed]] by some queer [[skiddie]] called '''The0neTheyCaLLg0d'''. Tom then created another account called [http://www.youtube.com/user/WARFLA WARFLA], which subsequently got grabbed as well.  Regardless, his initial [[ban]] from YouTube, despite his incessant [[BAWWWW|whining]] about it, was always a result of his own [[self-pwn|sloppiness]] as he is simply too oblivious to ever keep an account up for any length of time to begin with.  He's been hopping from account to account ever since, like some retarded online nomad without purpose or plan.   

As a result, Serson has spent most of his time on YouTube engaged in surgical efforts to portray himself in the midst of some non-existent eternal battle with his "haters", this despite him missing the boat on nearly every major internets-related [[drama]] on the tubes in the last 2 years, or being outright ignored by all relevant parties. In fact, Serson's only real exposure to the mainstream YouTube populace occurred when he was given access to [[HellionExciter]]'s account in August of '07. The YouTube audience responded as expected to Serson: he and Hellion were both banned within 3 hours.   

Serson's "trolling" (the term is used loosely) usually equates to a semblance of misplaced and preachy [[moralfag|moralfaggotry]], [[Fault Logic|faulty logic]], and/or obsequious [[lies|appeals to ignorance]] of the YouTube [[retards|viewers]] in an effort to [[SSP|promote]] his own name. His tact typically being to mock random nobodies for being on the internet...whilst spending his entire life on the internet - Serson, at one time, had a matter-of-fact [[IRL]] intervention with his parents for [[Chronic Troll Syndrome|excessive]] internet use (no srsly). He's acquired a reputation as a parasite, "[[SSP|piggy-backing]]" on any unrelated [[drama]] he catches whiff of at any given time, which he invariably attempts to milk for everything it's worth to [[namefag|promote himself]]. Serson is largely computer illiterate though, being somewhat [[newfag|unable]] to troll properly or do things himself and tends to rely on random gullible low-lifes to do shit for him, which he promptly takes credit for, believing anyone actually cared about his ineffectual [[masturbation|glory troll]] self-sucking to begin with. He can often be found [[white knighting]] for the odd [[RacerXWTFS|IRL granny tranny]], or [[Theredskull|disgraced neo-Nazi]], yet in the end Tom invariably finds his way back to where he started: by himself. 

Despite this, Serson has genuinely convinced himself he is an online "[[batshit|savior]]" of sorts, all the while making repeated [[flounce]] and [[ragequit]] videos after being trolled by his [[haters]]; he's been banned [[at least 100|innumerable]] times but has also quit on his own accord stating, in true [[drama queen]] fashion, that he was [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|leaving forever]] (only to [[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|return]] a week later pretending nothing happened). Moreover, Serson's also recently gone the true bitch route - the same as every other [[YouTube]] lolcow who's been [[butthurt|scorned]] by their haters - and started sending around [[DMCA]]'s to silence his critics. Indeed, even [[Argent009]] himself has owned Serson in vlog wars in the past.  But Serson returns to YouTube over, and over, and over again, all in the hopes that he will one day become an [[e-celebrity]], or in some attempt to [[nice try|scuttle]] the embarrassing e-trail he has created for himself over the last year, or in some desperate attempt to find [[so ronery|e-friends]] that can tolerate his faggotry, or perhaps it's an attempt to find some of the [[self-respect]] he's misplaced. Most likely though, it's some [[delusional|deluded]] attempt to reclaim something from his past...something that didn't exist to begin with.

==Life According to Serson==
[[Image:Dyslexia.jpg|thumb|right|This is clear.]]

To get a good idea of the mindset of one of YouTube's biggest failures, here is an excerpt of some of his own writings.  We apologize as even after it was proofread by some faggot friend of his it is almost unreadable, but that's what you get from an illiterate 26 year old pot head who lost the ability for logical thought years ago:

My motherfucking page. Where the truth will always set you free our get blanked from [[user:weatherman|weatherman]] AKA the guy who tried to call my house of course he failed like all others who tried but he does get brownie points for at least trying even though it resulted in Mr Skilling getting scared and laughed into retreat that's why there's no audio :) Then Mr Skilling had to turn to my little sister to get to me. When that failed what does Tiny Tim do he runs to all the chans and tries to get support when this fails he pumps his own threads with his man servant burk aka skuee in 5 years. From there Mr 4inchWeinerman started going to full disclosure and other sites to beg experienced trolls to troll me of the internets of course that never happened really if anything it had the reverse effect so thank you weinersexmanfor4dollers But that's all for tonight on Mr Skilling. I really don't think I should get banned you get <s>The great</s> Tom Serson page which really is me pumping you and your spy :) full of anything my little heart can think up at the moment so really I wrote that page and that's why its one of the better ones even though its epic fail but i am tired all edit tomm lets see how long I can keep this going Really this boils down to I have fucked with a lot of ed dinks from the tubes we are all trolls in this little world of ours I just happen to be better then most and I happen to troll people who I feel have somewhat influence over people. Most realize the ones who fear me are the ones living the biggest lie but I've been painted into something i am not if anyone i get the bigger picture more then 75 percent of the users I have come across its just [[drama]] = stuff for people to do, To talk about ,make vids about its basically creates life on the internets in a way so really fuck ed your should give me a reward your evil little bastards to play with except all the ed girls i wanna rape all of you but really if you don't like me your either a angry nerd that's fat and greasy our the typical nerd AKA [[user:BURK|Burk]] your a nerd that comes from the planet delusional and trying to hard. 2 30 in the morn 3 joints later. Other side note i would rape [[user:zenophile808|Zeno]] and [[user:DCY|DCY]] if i was given the chance. Other side note fbi chan has naked pics out there i was so let down they were fine and sexy till slutty till the 3rd pic the one you can see her asshole that's pretty fucking extreme even for me but again i would rape her also idée just have pretend she took those pics for me One more side not i will rape red skulls sister that's not a joke Jamie I am going to go 8mm on your little sister and i promise i will go Han solo on that asshole

<s>http://girlvinyl.com/Spectacular_Spectacular/pages/103003H2253_jpg.htm http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Sherrod YOU LOOK BETTER WITH BLUE HAIR why do all ed girls look asian and they always seem to be a bit thick and have huge tits that's why all these nerds are always moody you tease them you dirty dirty whores</s>

Saturdays WHAT TO DO WHAT TO DO THATS RIGHT TALK MORE SHIT. Today i will tell Ed how not to be so typical how to expand not be be so cutting edge our as a lot of you like to be called 4 chans little brother gay :) trust me i never try to be part of ed but i enjoy the site trolling your kiddies is always fun of course and trying to bang ed girls WHAT WHAT 2 and counting who will be lucky number 3 killa roo you dirty whore.

1) being [[anonymous]] is gay as fuck you need to have faces of ed it draws more people in gives a certain amount of credibility so really you need vloggers to vlog on your site and have them put vids from youtube on there users pages but a better option would be to make quick little websites ed ones easy html and have your vloggers use there little ed websites which if you think that will cost money u can still do the same as u would on ed . all you need to do is blank the page on youtube our whatever video site u want to use boom free bandwidth if ed was doing that from day one with the wiki pages you be winning it 18 million views in 3 years is good but lets say i am at 300,000 in 8 months the number is a bit higher t but whatever keep it simple i am one man on the perma ban on youtube hidden that doesent spam our do any real promtion ever so when u think about the number like that not that great why is the number low you need real people speaking for the website and really think about your choices becouse honest that would make our break your site thank god i dident allow mike to be the voice of ed that was a bad idea retards so that step ide get right on that if i was you ed slipping you really don't wanna miss the momentium becouse ed fresh in peoples minds you don't forget the site when you vistit but there's a good chance its not going to be as exciting as it could be to make them keep coming.

==A LOOK INTO TOM'S WORLD - "CUZ IT'S FUN!"==
==Tom heads for [[The Promised Land]]==
[[Image:Tom Serson Live Video.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Tom (fagging it up) on [[Live Video]].]]

Unable to keep an account open for more than a day at a time on [[YouTube]], and tired of being owned left, right and center in his vlog wars, Tom signaled defeat by packing his shit up and heading for [[LiveVideo]] in Oct 07 (<s>[http://www.livevideo.com/TOMSERSONSWORLD TOMSERSONSWORLD]</s> deleted).  He has since reached a new level of [[fail|epic fail]] by being wholly rejected by the mass of other butthurt nobodies [http://world.livevideo.com/video/Argent009/333C45958CC1433C97A23E19AA2CD9F8/tom-serson-please-unfail-your.aspx already on LiveVideo].  Tom lasted only a few weeks there before he [[delete fucking everything|baleeted everything]] and disappeared.  It had also been made apparent during this short period that Tom, as suspected, would do nearly anything for weed, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2LZOLHeudE including sexual favors].  Tom closed up shop in October of 07 with barely having made a blip on the LiveVideo radar.   

==Continues To Spiral Downward==
Tom made several failed attempts at returning to YouTube before he decided to close his internets in November of 07, but in the months after Tom disappeared Tom was sighted in several places.  Most notably he was was involved in a very lulzy battle with none other than Jamie Demeter (aka [[Theredskull]]) in early '08.  Threats of [[dox]] being dropped from either side and cries of [[lolsuit]] were heard as the two [[lolcow]]s went head to head in a battle to see who could fail the hardest.  

==Still Failing as a [[raidfag]]==
[[Image:Tom serson irl faggot canada.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Serson fails at [[IRL trolling]].]]
Tom attempted to return to the tubes again in early '08 and, as expected, has been fagging it up with the same shit as before.  Only this time he has surrounded himself with a "crew" of old men, bums, and [[pedos]] hoping that they'll take him to [[hookers and blow|FAME AND FORTUNE]].  In March '08 Tom was seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy-sKr8znrE attending] an [[Anon]] protest, but had no idea what the protest was about or even why he was even there to begin with. Tom was essentially so butthurt that he'd been trolled by some [[EDiots]] in the past that he decided to try and countertroll Anon (as he incorrectly equates the two in his head) so he quickly took advantage of the situation by yelling, "Hey, hey! Channers [[attention whore|LOOK AT ME YEAH]]! Yeah you chan people. I am right here," despite no one giving him the time of day.  In Serson's case, it has become increasingly obvious to everyone but him that perseverance does not always = win.

==Fails At Life, And [[zomg|Realizes It]]!!!==
[[Image:Rod_Burch.JPG|thumb|rodburch55, seen here dreaming about [[13_year_old_girl|Tom]]???]]
[[Image:Tom_Fails_At_Life.JPG|thumb|Tom learns the horrible truth.]]

In early May of 2008, a strange new vlogger burst onto the scene named <s>{{youtube2|rodburch55|rodburch55}}</s> ('''suspended'''). Rod's first few uploads were some recycled anti-[[troyriser]] vids (1st clue), and a vlog where Rod professed his undying adoration for Tom.  Tom was immediately smitten, and their whirlwind-of-faggotry-double-reacharound lovefest was off and running. They would be the trolling couple to end all trolling couples, and they were going to [[unrealistic expectations|take YouTube by storm]]. In true Tom fashion, he completely overlooked that there was something wrong here. This "new user" seemed to possess quite a bit of knowledge about the happenings on YouTube despite his "newness". One of the recycled anti-troyriser videos that Rod hosted had a ripped copy of a dancing [[16 year old girl|12 year old girl]] in it. YouTube veteran <s>{{youtube2|KatyDBates|KatyDBates}}</s> ('''closed''') asked Rod about the video, and why he had such a thing on his computer in the first place. The answers were slow coming (2nd clue). In the interim, Rod mysteriously removed the anti-troy vids but continued to vlog away. Several uploads later Rod began making vlogs about various members of the [[YouTube Yahweh Clan]] (3rd clue). Again, Tom, showing his attention to detail, still had no idea anything was wrong.  This caught the attention of the [[YTYC]], and they began looking into this mysterious new vlogger. Lo and behold it came to light that this was no new vlogger, but someone that had been around YouTube for at least a couple of years. As a matter of fact, he had several [[sockpuppet]]s, and actually had a very unhealthy affinity for [[pedophile|little girls]]. It turned out he liked to stalk them and try to get in their pants with flattery, as those [[sick_fucks]] tend to do. By this time, Rod had gotten around to coming up with some [[bullshit|answers]] to the questions previously asked by Katy. Almost [[Time_Cube|simultaneously]] as Rod's new vlog was being uploaded, the YTYC was uploading their video exposing his [[sockpuppet]] child stalking. By the time Tom sobered up and realized everything that had happened, it was too late...'''Tom Serson had publicly endorsed a pedophile on YouTube.''' '''[[Myboss]]''' immediately picked up on the situation releasing a series of videos [[pwn]]ing the shit out of Tom. To try to save face, Tom hastily [[Lolcano|uploaded a video blaming the YTYC for not protecting him]], and admonishing Katy for not warning him (despite the fact that she did). The lulz were so thick you could cut it with a knife.  Tom compared the situation to having a nuke being dropped on him, and immediately set about YouTube commenting peoples pages with one simple phrase, "I fail at life". See the videos below for chronological lulz as they happened.

==A New Level of Fail==
[[Image:Sersons shitty Freewebs site down.png|thumb|right|260px|Serson's [[Freewebs]] [http://www.changingtheinternets.webs.com/ website]he's been trying to get off the ground for 2 years.   It went down only a few days after going online.  The flood of [[AIDS]] and stench of faggotry was too much even for a low-rent dogshit host for [[poor|penniless]] [[noobs]].]]
[[Image:Yes lulz.jpg|right]]

Tom's whereabouts are largely [[shit nobody cares about|unknown]] as he's left yet again in the midst of another [[ragequit]] following being {{youtube|VEUdTM2JEFQ|fired}} from his job as a [[lollercoaster|telemarketer]] for making death threats to some geriatric [[woman]] who wouldn't give him a [[jew gold|donation]].  So for all anyone <s>knows</s> cares he's gone back to Brockeville to [[basement dweller|live]] with his parents (again).  Fear not though, Serson will return to the tubes once again to convince [[you]] he will be the next Jew one day.  

It is unclear whether he will try his hand at [[Vloggerheads]] with [[Renetto]] the pedo.

==[[Lolsuits]] & Failed Website==
[[Image:Tom Serson DMCA bitch.png|frame|center|<center>[[GG]].</center>]]
[[Image:Smapp serson.jpg|thumb|right|The mighty SMAPP; Tom's "partner" in [[DMCA]] crime]]
Sure enough, the [[footbullet]]s continue, as, despite his surgical efforts to milk that last ounce of [[internets]] fame, he's recently made something very apparent.  He recently began filing massive amounts of [[partyvan|false dmca's]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y80vJk4xAQ all over YouTube] to silence his critics - by getting some 400 pound [[basement dweller]] who goes by the handle '''Smapp''' to do it for him (lol he couldn't find anyone else).  He's since fallen out with him.  Thus, after a year and a half on the tubes he's now gone the same route as every other delicate YouTube [[lolcow]].  Serson enjoys using people that don't know anything about his past though, since whenever people find out about his epic failures they usually run from him like the fucking plague.   He's been exploiting his [[Greenteagirlie|new]] and very [[naive]] "girlfriend" <s>{{youtube2|gothicSailorMoonRulz|Carine}}</s> ('''suspended''') as his [[personal army]].  Oh yeah, he dropped her [[dox]] too.

Basically shit started getting really fucked up when '''Thekaraokeman''' (Sam) entered the picture. While very difficult to explain; some ex-junkie faggot thought it would be a good idea to be Tom's personal gloryhole.

==Current==
[[Image:Tomserson canada.jpg|thumb|right|110px|Keep trying dude.]]
Having had his fill of [[lolsuit]] failings and being owned repeatedly (with his own YouTube accounts), he was recently [[Haxxor|keylogged]] around the end of 2008 and had his email account [[phished]] with some very lulzy emails to his monther begging for money as well as [[chatlog]]s exposed ([http://thomasserson.blogspot.com/ see here for moar]).  Serson's also since developed a "[[buttsecks|Daddy]]" complex and sought help ([[desperate|from a man 20 years his senior]]) to help him fight his "[[BAWWWW|haters]]" on the tubes.  No one knows where he is now, but [[sarcasm|judging from his past, it will definitely work out and he totally won't fuck up again]].  '''Update:''' Lulz, Serson says he's [[flounce|leaving]] YouTube...for the 4th time now.  He's gonna give another shot at starting that "website" he thinks people actually care about.  Let us know how it works out this time, Tom.  

How'd the last 2 years work out anyways?

[[image:Tom_serson_carine.jpg|center]]

==[[Epic]], Just Fucking Epic==
As Tom returned to YouTube in his most recent incarnation {{youtube2|SERSONTOLOGYQuebec|SERSONTOLOGYQuebec}}, he was disheartened to find that the general public had grown tired of his faggotry, and didn't really give two shits about what he thought or what videos he was making. In a desperate cry for attention he produced this unpalatable turd:<br><br>
'''LOL BALEETED'''
<br><br>
As with most attention whores, if Tom can't get positive attention, he'll gladly settle for infamy. Being a creature that thrives on attention, Tom has become accustomed to, even quite fond of, negative attention. And although he was prepared for the random butthurt comment from the easily shocked YouTube populace, what he wasn't prepared for was what happened next.

Tom's long time friend and confidant, Sam {{youtube2|TheMaskComesOff|TheKaraokeMan}}, had already been re-evaluating his association with Tom as it was. But when he saw this 29 seconds of simulated pedophilic horseshit, the shit really hit the fan. As the registered owner of the Sersontology websites, Sam had the power to pull the plug on Tom's little make believe cult whenever he felt like it. And after viewing Tom's hastily made "look at me I'm rapin' babies" video, [[lol|he felt like it]].

As a special [[lollercaust|added bonus]], Sam called GoDaddy.com himself and had them redirect the domains [http://sersontology.com sersontology.com] and [http://www.sersontology.com www.sersontology.com] to point back to this article for the duration of his ownership of said domains, [[2012|1.5 years]]. [[lmao|Goodnight Tom]].

'''UPDATE:''' To add insult to injury, {{youtube2|Papouliot|Papouliot}} has just deleted [http://www.retro62.com Retro62.com] as well. lol

==New Fail For An Old Lolcow==
[[File:Tommy_mowing_the_lawn.jpg|thumb|"read it again i owned my own lawn care business with my father well he bought it for me is better words" - Tom Serson]]
In true Tom fashion, Serson has been scouring YouTube looking for any and all drama he can leech off of, in an attempt to make a name for himself. Recently his big claim to fame has been that he wanted to debate [[User:Subseven|Subseven]]. In a recent [[skype]] call, he finally got his chance. Because he's unable to comprehend the complexities of basic [[warez]] like audio recorders, his first instinct was to grab his video camera and point it at his computer. After he recorded said conversation, he then [[lol|edited out all the parts where he got his ass handed to him]], and uploaded the doctored video to YouTube. All [[the biggest loser]]s in the YouTube galaxy lined up to lick his ass and congratulate him on his epic fake win.

None of them bothered to think that he would edit the tapes, because '''1)''' he didn't tell them he did, and '''2)''' most of the people in that list are already so butthurt about their own articles, that they didn't really ''care'' if the recordings were accurate or not. They all laughed and sucked each others dicks, at what appeared to be, a small victory in [[taking down ED]]. 

Unfortunately for Tom, he wasn't the only the only one recording. Unedited versions of the call were RELEASE RELEASE RELEASED, and soon the smiles and dick-sucking came to a screeching halt.

Tom raged over this major embarrassment. He <i>almost</i> finally had a minor win, only to have it ripped out from underneath him like a rug at the last minute. [[;_;]]
