'''Crimson-Silvrblood''', also known as ''NyxOfTheStormRiders'' or ''Nyx'' to her [[fantard|microscopic fanbase]], is a batshit insane[[deviantART|TARTlet]] accused of stealing the artwork of fellow batshit insane TARTlet [[Ladyhellfyre]]. She's returned with more [[lulz|lolz]] to give.

==Melayne ≠ Vistyne==
[[Image:Lhfdon'tcare.PNG|thumb|150px|Nyx and a friend, basking in their delusions.]]
[[Image:Lhfjournal.PNG|thumb|150px|LHF, being a dramawhore like always.]]
Melayne, or as her opposition affectionately calls her, "Bizarrostyne," is a [[Plagiarism|virtual mirror image]] of LadyHellFyre's Vistyne Sinestora.  This [[Not|coincidence]] was spotted by one of LHF's watchers.  LHF presumably ignored the copying for weeks, until Crimson-Silvrblood began [[butthurt|maliciously attacking]] her watchers and friends, citing that the only reason she was not guilty was that LHF had not accused her of the theft herself. [[lolwut|Wut?]]

LHF [[BAWW|authored a journal listing the similarities between the characters]] while bawwing to her close fanbrats. Her army of [[fantards|TARTlets]] immediately jumped in to avenge her butthurtz. 

However, [[some argue]] that the poor bastard in this screenshot noticed the similarities between the two [[Mary Sue|Mary Sues]] long before this bullshit even started.

Note Nyx's immediate response is to [[RAGE|unleash the motherfucking fury]]. Guilty conscience much? Or the fact that she had been plagued by the legion of tartlets weeks before?

==The Battle Begins==

On devART, flaming someone who has drawn a character which looks a lot like your idol's is considered the best way to get them to stop doing that shit. (See: [[Snapesnogger]]) In true devART fashion, after LHF's minions flamed her, Nyx took the opportunity to flame LHF's friend {{deviantart|t3h-dyl4n|t3h-dyl4n}}'s artwork, based on the fact that her [[lolwut|anatomy was wrong because her art contains mostly furries.]]  The argument spiraled into [[Anti-lulz|insane hilarity]] as Nyx continued to fling insults like pretty much [[Superdemon-Inuyasha|every]] [[Trumi|other]] [[Draco_Ookami|TARTlet]] to ever be accused of tracing. She has been quoted saying, "I may have fucked myself over in the past for my terrible and violent attitude" and continued on in a rant about ED. Two words: YA THINK?

Nyx wrote [[BAWW|bitchy, disjointed journal entries]] about the "harassment" and promptly went about the rest of her day. Little did she know that devART never sleeps and neither do the trolls that lurk within the layer of shit that dA pours glitter on and pretend their site is teh shit.

==[[Tracing]]==
[[Image:Fursucker.PNG|thumb|130px|Whatever helps you sleep at night.]]
Finally, [[fantard|someone]] made some small, hard to see overlays of the two characters and posted them as "proof". As is to be expected in cases like these, LHF's fantards screamed "SEE! SEE, IT WAS TRACED!!!!11one1!" while some of Nyx's fantards insisted that no tracing was done. Anyone who can spot the accusations out of this image must have eyes that can see through retardation.

<center>[[Image:Trace1.png]] [[Image:Trace2.png]]</center>

([[PROTIP]]:Next time do a higher-rez overlay, [[retard]])

In what has thus far been the only vaguely lulzy thing to come out of this whole incident, Nyx posted this journal entry accusing the LHF fanbrat who had made the overlay of stealing her art, and also bragging about how her big sister [[pwned]] said fantard on AIM. Nothing says "I'm a badass!" like [[pussy|hiding behind your '''little''' sister]]. On the internetz.

==Asmilingmalice - [[faggot|Too Cool]] for ED==
[[Image:Fartonyou.jpg‎|thumb|Best way to repel [[furries]].]]
[[Image:Got balls.jpg|thumb|Raping [[Duke Nukem]] isn't cool and neither are you.]]
Her 19 years of existence are questionable. [[some argue|Scientists estimate 46 years]]. For being stupid she deserves to be coupled with Nyx in the infamous ED. [[Mary Sue|Magdelena]] or {{deviantart|asmilingmalice|asmilingmalice}} also hates [[furfags]], which has abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with how much of an attention whore she is, writing journals about bullshit that doesn't concern her and then bawwing when the internet responds. Her best argument is that furries are all [[DracoGuard|dog-fuckers]], so they must have no clue how much of a complete shitdick moron she actually is.

When not tracing the fuck out of everything imaginable on the interwebs or raping miscellaneous fandoms, she also spends time being a rabid Harry Potter fantard, though claims that she couldn't possibly be one, despite [[ALL CAPS|DRESSING UP AS A FUCKING CHARACTER FROM THE BOOKS]]. She's also an obsessed anti-[[Twilight]]er because she thinks it makes her cool. She also, unsurprisingly, pretends to be the [[Joker]]'s [[mary sue|Henchgirl]] thus infecting the internets with more absolutely fucking heinous nurse cosplay, even though no one would tap that shit, ever. Her tracing and shitty fucking behavior has also infected the Hellsing fan community, leading to many, many lulz with her failed attempts to [[troll]] the ever-living hell out of them. Much to her dismay, no one actually thinks she's funny or clever.

Her art does the complete opposite of improving and being the [[retard]] she is, she has yet to discover the [http://community.livejournal.com/hellsing/1261719.html?nc=37 ruler]. She has also created a handful of deviantART stamps that no one fucking cares about.  Her [[Mary Sue|character]] Malice has been noted raping an near endless variety of fandoms, including Hellsing and Watchmen.

Further proof leads us to conclusive evidence that asmilingmalice used to be fantard/troll [[User:Rosedincht|RoseDincht]] [http://roseisugly.ytmnd.com/]. It should also be noted she is now the self-declared "Nolanverse Harley Quinn".
