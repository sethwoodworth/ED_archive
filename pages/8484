Topix
'''Topix.com''' is a [[shit]] news site that's sole existence on this planet is to be the [[OL]] host to the parasites that are liberals, [[faggots]], know-it-alls, and [[emo|posers]].  What makes this site extremely [[lulz]] worthy is that their forums and the comments under each news story are hardly ever viewed by moderators.  This causes [[TL;DR]] comments and posts that can easily be trolled for drama.

=Topix, We're Popular= 
From their own site:

''More than 1 million people posted 5.5 million comments, adding more than 30,000 comments a day. And many of the most passionate discussions were happening at the local level.''
'''Translation: We are swamped with many passionate discussions about the good side of pedophilia and talking about the proportions of someones [[dick]].'''

''''But even with 50,000 news sources, there just wasn't enough local news - and what news there was, couldn't be tuned finely enough with algorithms alone.''

''So, in April 2007, we decided to open up our site, and give anyone the power to discuss, edit and share the news that matters to them.''''
'''Translation: We seriously fucked ourselves here.  We might as well put a sign up that says "Welcome all trolls!"'''  

''''Previously, several Topix [[Jews|founders]] created the Open Directory Project (originally called "NewHoo"), the first open development directory for the Internet, and now the largest human-edited web directory.''

''Topix is applying that model to the news, turning passive news into active dialogue by giving people an easy-to-use publishing system with a built-in audience.''''
'''Translation: We welcome all [[attention whores]] and [[emos]] to come to our site and post how the atrocities and suffering in Darfur pale in comparison to how shit your life is in the suburbs.''' 

''''We have combined the best technology with the strongest local participation to create the best destination for news and discussion. By giving everyone access to the tools to talk - and an audience to listen - Topix redefines what it means to make the news.''

''Topix. Your town. Your news. Your take.''''
'''Translation: Open the Flood Gates!'''


=What Should I Expect?=

Oh precious things!  If your itch to piss off any group, party, or religion needs to be scratched then this is the place you should invest your time in.  Everything is available for lulz; from pissed-off [[Slut|pro-choice advocates]] to grieving family members!  The fun never stops when you are on Topix!  This statement is further guranteed by the fact that the site will give you your local news as well.  So now you can be an asshole in your own community and no one needs to ever know.

==Examples of Fun==

The context of this "passionate" discussion seems to be that someones sister was murdered and there are several shady types claiming to know the victim.
