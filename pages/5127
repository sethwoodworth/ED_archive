Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
[[File:Ahmadinejad wife.jpg|thumb|right|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his mentor, Darth Sidious.]]

'''Mahmoud Ahmadinejad''' is the [[SysOp|glorious president]] of [[Iran]] and world-renowned [[IRL troll]], who is tirelessly dedicated to hating [[freedom]] and exposing the [[Holocaust|Zionist's many lies]] as well as some [[Jews did WTC|lesser known facts]]. This, we know. But did you also know that [[Fact|he is a sexy beast]][http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2007/09/debate-over-whe.html], for whom [[YOU]] have a serious boner? Unfortunately for [[you]], Mahmoud has single-handedly rid Iran of your type of [[faggotry]]. As well as this, he's pwned the [[Israel]]i and British Navy for coming too close to Iranian shores, actually sinking a Jew warship in 2000 [[for great justice]]. [[Israel]] hates him for endorsing Lebanese [[terrorists|heroes]], and [[fucktard|America]] hates him because they are owned by Israel.

[[Image:TROLLMAHMOUD.jpg|thumb|right|clearly a troll.]]

The mere mention of Mahmoud's name on the [[Internets]] is invariably followed by indulgent [[butthurt]] of both a [[conservative]] and [[liberal]] bent. Trolling via a [[Fifty Hitler Post|Fifty Mahmoud Post]] is best recommended in such occurrences. 

==Fun Facts About Mahmoud==

* Supports the fact that [[JEWS DID WTC]]. About fucking time someone spoke up!
* The [[Indian]] programmer in ''Office Space'' had the same name.
* Mahmoud has encouraged Iranians to have lots of [[sex|babies]], saying the Iran could handle 50 million more people than its current 70 million. Some argue that Mahmoud is thereby building his own [[personal army]].
* Mahmoud rejects all ideologies and principles devised in the West except [[Holocaust]] denial.
* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6619077.stm He enrages conservatives by sexing up old women and doesn't afraid of anything.]
* Mahmoud has [[banhammer|b&]] all [[fail|Western music]] from Iran  including [[My Chemical Romance|Fall Out Boy]] and [[My Chemical Romance]]. [[emos|Some]] actually [[BAWWWWW|criticize]] him for this.
* Mahmoud has also [[banhammer|b&]] all major [[fail|Western websites]]  such as [[YouTube|JewTube]] and [[The Social Network|Jewbook]]. Amazingly, some [[BAWWWWW|criticize]] him for this as well. [[Irony|Which means if you live in Iran, you aren't reading this right now.]]
* Mahmoud possesses as many facial expressions as he does [[man points]], which are so infinitely many that he is an improbability of physics at this stage.
* Satirical humour directed at t3h Ahmadinejad on the [[Internets]] is usually full of unfunny faggotry. 
** [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxLOhl0C2JI This proves it.]
** [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad As does this.]
** [http://www.hulu.com/watch/16771/saturday-night-live-snl-digital-short-iran-so-far This, howevar, is awesome.]
* Mahmoud likes to wear a lot of white polyester jackets. It is possible the same white polyester jacket worn multiple times. It is also possible he is a [[fag]]. [[party van|Mossad]] are investigating.
* Used to be a Jew, which he fails at hiding by trolling Israel.  (moar like '''Ahmasecretjew''', amirite?)
* [http://www.huliq.com/3257/87264/does-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-secretly-have-jewish-roots.stm His original Jew name was Sabourjian, which is Jew for 'Christ Puncher.']

== Hey Dude I Herd U Liek Bin Laden ==

<center><youtube>oLkiM4CHAJo</youtube></center>

On May 5th, pro-Jew "journalist" George Stephanopoulos interviewed [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]; it would be more accurate to say that he barraged Mookie with loaded questions regarding Iran's alleged plans to develop nuclear weapons and belligerence towards [[Israel]] and the [[U.S.]], even going so far as to imply that [[Bin Laden]] was in Tehran, to which the Iranian leader responded by calmly putting on his [[trollface]] and [[NO U|stating that he had heard Bin Laden was in Washington DC]]. This is how it's done, [[gentlemen]].

==Jews Did 9/11==

On the 24th of September, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad trolled a [[UN]] conference with his theories about [[9/11]]. Standing infront of around [[at least 100|100]] people, he began to describe how the [[US]] government had falcon punched the trade centres to get their economy working again, and to help the zionist regime, aka [[Israel]]. Half way through his [[tl;dr|speech]] the US ambassador decided to hit the [[wambulance]] and promptly walked out; he was shortly followed by [[Belgium]], [[Fag|Britain]], [[France]], [[Norway]] and a shitload of other countries who couldn't be bothered listening to his ramblings, although all of which were [[Jews did 9/11|true]]. Inspite of [[Israel|other]] countries criticising him, he simply remarked "I have nuclear now. You wanna mess [[wigger|wit me]]?" Much [[Baw]] and [[lulz]] will continue following [[Rape|peace]] talks for the middle east.
