Baka
'''Baka''' is a [[Japanese]] adjective for "stupid" or "foolish".

Properly typed as "馬鹿"; also has several verb conjugations depending on context and tense. 

Yakuza tattoo artists use ばか for [[lulz]], (or バカ for exponential [[lulz]] increase, because katakana is used when converting foreign words into [[moonspeak|Japanese]].) When [[13 year old boys|13 year old]] [[animé]] fanatic [[basement dwellers]] request the characters for "[[Sailor Moon]] loves me," the resulting tattoo usually involves "baka" and/or the Japanese words for "[[cock]]-sucking [[weeaboo|roundeye]] [[fag|bastard]]."  Run like a <s>starved</s> ordinary Kenyan chasing down a gazelle if you're tapping that ass from behind and s/he has either of these abhorrent mutations inked on her lower back.
