He's been fucking around on GaiaOnline since at least 2007.  It's safe to assume this only touches the surface of his Gaia faggotry.

Don't forget to [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/User:OhSoSimple/ChadSyphrett/Accounts#Gaia check out his list of 29 known accounts].

=Harassing and Stalking Teen Girls=
He keeps most of his creepiness in PMs, profiles comments, but off the forums.

==Pandamoo7==
PandaMoo7 is a friend of some of Chad's Gaia friends.  The other friends had the good sense to drop off Chad's Internet radar.  His attentions soon turned to Pandamoo7.

He came on strong, with highly appropriate questions.

(Unrelated Gaiafaggotry has been cropped out for clarity, your own sanity, and to save ED's bandwidth and server space.)

((Fullview on all of these works, wiki software apparently has trouble with GIFs.))

Screenshots from her comments page.

Then, the trouble started.  Screenshots from Chad's page.

After all that, you would expect Chad to leave her alone, right?

No.  Back on her page, this goes down.

He hit a roadbloack.

The only solution is more sockpuppets.  He created "InfoWars" and "Unique Situer" to be brother and sister, and befriend Pandamoo7.  He intelligently told his other "friend" about his undercover plan.

He created more sock puppets to befirend her, and tried to get other people to do his dirty work.

When you see comments like this on Chad's page, you have to wonder what happened.
[[Image:OREO-comments-on-chadsyphrett.gif|thumb|center]]

So let's see what he was up to on her page.

Off to a good start, as usual.

Then he revealed his age as almost 17.

[[Image:Chadsyphrett-comments-on-oreo-08.gif|thumb|center]]
The small talk continues.  He introduces "Truth Brigade" as another 14 year old.

Than, a month later, he comes back to her page.  It's all downhill from there.

Chad left a final swipe on her page before running to the forums.

These threads were made to help bring her down.

It earned her a place on his "VAIN FUCKTARD" hate-list linked previously.

==Wind and Willows==
He made this topic allegedly to mock her for posting photos on her profile.  Then he blanked all his comments to cover it up.  Most of his comments were preserved by people who quoted his bullshit, saving it for posterity.
*[http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/general-discussion/x/t.50499595/ X]  June 2nd 2009
Ironically, he posted this advice on her profile just a few days earlier.

==Tess n Grae==
His hatred of her even spilled over onto DeviantArt:
