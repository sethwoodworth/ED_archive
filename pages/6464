'''Please advise''' is a [[Old|new and exciting meme]] in the business world, it roughly translates to "I have no fucking clue what it is I am talking about, so you tell me what I need to know."

== Origins ==
Back when the [[internets]] were singular and text-only, a writer (and actor and stuff) named Robert Benchley was sent to Venice on assignment for the ''New Yorker'' magazine.

When he got there, he sent his editor a telegram.
<pre>STREETS FULL OF WATER. PLEASE ADVISE.</pre>

Boy, with wacky quips like that on tap, those ''New Yorker'' guys ought to be writing for [[Uncyclopedia]].
