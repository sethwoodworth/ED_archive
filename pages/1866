Cross-post
{{merge|blog}}

Crossposting is simply taking something posted somewhere on the [[internet]] and putting it somewhere else for maximum keystroke value.  There are two major varieties of crossposting:

*Laziness-- When a user invested so much energy into his post that he wishes to [[spam| put it into]] as many [[communities]] as possible, regardless of its relevance to to the community.  This is why one frequently sees posts about cleaning up [[cat]] [[vomit|puke]] in {{ljcomm|user=poor_skills}}. 

*Sharing the [[lulz]] /Fueling a [[flame war]]-- [[Drama]], like sex, is lame when there are only two people involved.  Therefore, exporting drama to a personal journal or another community helps to draw bands of [[trolls]].  [[Boob_nazis]] and the [[childfree]] are ripe targets for this type of crossposting.
