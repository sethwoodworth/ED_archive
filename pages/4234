'''Jassa''' is a mammoth fatass, best known for ''The [[BOOBIES!!]] Project'' on [[LiveJournal]]. He succeeds in regularly pissing off anyone who subscribes to the various syndicated feeds on [[LJ]].
==The BOOBIES!! Project==
[[Image:jassalol.jpg|thumb|the icon]]
[[Last Thursday]], under the journal <s>{{lj|jassa}}</s> {{lj|jassalol}}, Jassa posts the phrase BOOBIES!! in a syndicated feed as a "response" or "demonstration" against people who spam with such things as "FIRST POST!!!111". This has happened on every post, on every thread, without fail, for twenty-eight months, proving that Jassa is, in fact, a gigantic [[basement dweller]] with nothing better to do.

===The main rules for 'BOOBIES!!':===
# It's always spelt the same way. BOOBIES!!. No exceptions.
# No extra text in the comment.
# It must be posted within 24 hours of the feed/community update, on every feed/community update (or the main update, in the case of some feeds).
# All BOOBIES!! posts must be made with a variant of the "Drunken Whore" icon.

===BOOBIES!! Drama===
Having a bunch of [[retarded]] [[noob|noobs]] tear their sweaty hands away from their cocks to get ''FIRST POST!!!OMGZORS!!11''' is perfectly acceptable to the larger [[LiveJournal]] community. Apparently someone posting BOOBIES!! isn't.
Responses to BOOBIES!! have been mixed. Some are inspired by Jassa's persistence, while others write [[tl;dr]] diatribes against him about how the post is ruining the ''"intellectual discussion"'' of the feed. Bear in mind that the syndicated feeds that Jassa posts on are for [[webcomic|comics]] that are either horribly obscure or incredibly stupid. Jassa has managed to evoke the craving for drama that 99% of LiveJournal lusts for with the simple post of "BOOBIES!!"

All this would be fine, except that Jassa, as a minor demon of annoyance, generates deadly rays of [[anti-lulz]].  If you should find him in your LJ wanderings, coat him in lead and throw him into the ocean.
==Death==
Jassa stopped spamming "BOOBIES!!" in late March 2008. He probably died IRL.
