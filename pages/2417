Dragon Age: Origins
[[Image:DragonAgeOrigins.jpg|frame|Dragon Age: Origins]]
'''''Dragon Age: Origins''''' (DA:O) is a beat-to-shit ugly 3rd-person RPG from [[Mass Effect|Bioware]], similar to Baldur's Gate and KOTOR, with real-time and [[crap|somewhat decent]] combat system and story. It's like playing [[WoW]], except that your fights are fucked up by stupid AI instead of stupid teammates. The game's best aspects are outside of combat. The recruitable NPC's have well developed personalities, with some [[lulz|lulzy]] banter between them during long walks, getting your girl/boy/[[trap|etc.]]-friend to bust you out of the worst prison ever (you can sneak out by killing two guards, a dog, and stealing armor), and one of the endings involves awkwardly-animated, PG-13 [[Goth]]-sex to create an [[Silent Hill|Old God]] or [[Cthulhu|something]].

'''BTW SPOILERS AHEAD'''

== Backstory ==

Something about some [[Pagan|Pagans]] breaking into the [[God|Maker's]] time-share and trying to kick his ass and take his loots. Unfortunately, this backfired and the Maker [[B&]] them from [[IRC|vahalla.net]] after they touched his crib and spread their leprosy everywhere, turning his [[Roman Shower|Golden City]] into the [[Detroit|Black City]]. Along with polluting their Lord's divine condo, they were also infected and became [[Arab|twisted creatures that do nothing but rape, pillage, and kill everything they don't understand]]. And thus, the [[Arab|Darkspawn]] were born. Why are Darkspawn so insane, you might ask? Picture if all of [[B|/b/]] turned into IRL trolls, then double their IQ. Their leader is a [[FYIAD|dragon (for some reason, like oh, the title)]] called the [[Moot|"Archdemon"]], and they don't like [[Socialism|sharing the Earth and playing nice]] with average Joe/Jane Nobody. Some thousands of years later, after many [[VIP|edit wars]] and [[Holocaust|culling]] of [[Jews|inferior races]], they have come back, yet again, to wreck humanity's shit.

=== Where [[You]] Come In ===

Depending on what [[dongs|sex]], [[Black|race]], and [[EFG|class]] you pick, your story will begin differently (and it's damn pointless to tell you what will take maybe half an hour to knock out, so [[DO IT FAGGOT]]) but [[derp|end up in mostly the same ways]]. Along the beginning, you can choose many paths, be it [[White Knight]], [[lulz]]-[[rape|killer]], [[USI|overcompensating dick]], or any other bullshit your character can talk its way into/out of. By the way, that's what you'll being doing about 2/3rds of the game - talking. A lot. [[Boring|A WHOOOOOOLE LOT]]. Talking to demons, your teammates, random people in the street, even a [[LOL WUT|rock or two]] at some points. If there's any added benefit to it, you get some of the best means of spreading the soon-to-be mentioned [[AIDS|Grey Warden's curse]] to some of these mundanes when it gets too agonizing to feign interest anymore.

So after you start your Origins (lol), you eventually get carried away from your [[derp|home/warzone/jail sentence...fuck it]], you eventually end up in Ostagar with Duncan, a Grey Warden Commander of [[Germany|Ferelden]] who agreed to help the local fanboy, King Calien, kill a few Darkspawn hordes and hope another [[WW2|Blight]] isn't coming. After this, you get to explore the town, meet an old woman named Wynne who bitches too much even before you can use her in the game, a scheming Jew named Loghain, and have a tutorial where you meet your first fuck-doll (if you're a girl; just a BFF as a dude), Alistair. This upcoming tutorial mission will be spent one of three ways:

*'''Rogue''' - [[Black|Bust locks, steal from people, do no actual damage but claim mad props]]--None of the chests in the game contains anything valuable and if you pickpocket someone, the guards will ALWAYS fucking know, even if nobody saw you doing it and eventually try to arrest you, making this the most useless class in any game ever!

*'''Warrior''' - [[Retard|Meat shield]]

*'''Mage''' - [[An Hero|No one loves you, you should just kill yourself already fgt]]--Propably the best class in any game ever, since you can cast AoE spells thru the walls and doors, killing fucking everything in the room, without having to expose yourself in the actual combat

The mission ends when you meet/flirt with [[Goth|Morrigan]] while your bros cry like virgins meeting their first girl, and from there you go to the [[Bug Chasers|Joining]]. In this Joining, you ''intentionally'' drink AIDS-infested blood mixed in with LSD and fuck knows what else. Survive the trip, become a [[faggot|Warden]]. BTW, those other guys you and Alistair are hanging out with? Dead by midnight (srsly). Duncan, Calian, nearly everyone else besides Alistair? Dead tomorrow. The rest of the game? Getting revenge on your sugar-daddy's death as well as on Loghain, the weak, back-stabbing cunt who didn't trust the [[French|Orlisians]].

== Fuckbuddies ==
You can [[fuck|'romance']] characters, 2 of the opposite sex and 1 of the [[faggot|same]], climaxing in a softcore cutscene of [[Secks]]. This can take a long or short time to achieve, depending on how much of a slut/horndog the chosen NPC is. Without any mod, 'naked' characters have embarrassing white underwear on, but the cutscenes are generated from the in-game body models. So under [[Rule 34]], guess how long it took for a nude mod to be available, in nanoseconds. Anyway, here are the choices:


[[Image:DAO_Morrigan.jpg|thumb|120px|Morrigan]]
===Morrigan===
Highly fapworthy darkside witch. When people are in trouble, you score points with her by standing back and watching them suffer, for the [[lulz]]. If your character is male, whether you jumped on her bones ASAP or not, she will come to you near the end of the game wanting to ride you. If you're playing a female, she wants to do one of the guys in the party instead. Summary: Ho Ho Ho.


[[Image:DAO_Leliana.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Leliana]]
===Leliana===
Rogue who has found DA:O Jesus. Sweet and pious but if you put the effort in, she bangs like a bunny with any race or sex. Don't worry, there are no playable [[furries]] in this game (unless you count Morrigan turning into [[bear|bears]] and [[A RAPE SPIDER|spiders]], but she won't [[yiff]] [[furry|you]] like that). Anyway, you can watch this goody-goody convent girl squirm around with a bald female dwarf or a black person, if that's what turns you on. To pry apart Leliana's knees you have to help every Hardluck Harry and Sally Sobstory you meet, while Morrigan vomits. Summary: Bisexually randy Christian, who would have thought?<br />
<br />
[[Image:DAO_Alistair.jpg|thumb|110px|Alistair]]
<br />
<br />
===Alistair===
Tank, very popular with [[NGOTI|female]] players on the boards, but doesn't know a good thing when it flashes its twat in his face. Another goody two-shoes repressed by religion. Plays shy and hard to get for female PC's. But unless she is a stuck-up human noble, he ends up ploughing her furrow then avoiding long-term commitment, like any normal guy. Summary: Well-acted simulation of a sexually repressed [[emo]]. [[Lie|He is ''totally'' not Carth from KOTOR.]]
[[Image:DAO_Zevran.jpg|thumb|left|90px|Zevran]]
<br />
<br />
===Zevran===
Assassin, and a great guy to have around. [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS|Disregard that, he sucks cocks]]. [[Srsly]]. Fag elf who doesn't mind squirting into a chick now and then instead of a guy's caboose. Whatever the PC's gender it's easy to boink him, much harder to get him to say he lurvs you. But why bother? He has an air of mild amusement whether you rescue kittens or set fire to orphanages. You can execute him as soon as you meet him in true [[Fundie]] style, but you'll miss out on some lulz, e.g. If you put him in the same party with the granny healer, he'll come on to her. Summary: Legolas with attitude and a Eurotrash accent.

{{clear}}

===Etc.===
There are other NPC's you can recruit but can't shag. In order of descending desirability they are: the big foreigner, the pwned and converted villain, the trannie golem, the dwarf, the dog, and the granny. The granny has the same body model as the other women, but nag nag nag, [[gb2kitchen|get back to the mage tower]]. She keeps her legs crossed anyway.

Try getting Leliana to the "loves you but not ready to screw yet" stage, and then fuck Morrigan. Lulz ensue when you are forced to drop one of them. Guess which one is the most [[butthurt]]. Also, in the jailbreak sequence, send the two of them to pose as nuns and kak yourself at how full of [[FAIL]] Morrigan is.

[[Shit nobody cares about|It's also important to say]] that there's a whorehouse stage in the game called "The Pearl" in which you can have sex for a small fee. Fuck buddies along with a gay dwarf and a [[shemale]] elf will line up in hope you'll fuck them.

[[File:Sandal.png|thumb|130px|Sandal]]

===Sandal===

The only good reason to play this game is, by far, Sandal: The token dwarven retard who was too radiated from [[Drugs|lyrium]] to say anything other than a few lines, and "ENCHANTMENT!"

While you will find other retards in this game (other dwarves, no doubt), Sandal is the only one that doesn't piss the fuck out of you so much you'd want to stab him with a sword like the other mentally challenged NPC's you meet (just like in real life, [[Amirite]]?). No, srsly, kill the other retards you meet. PLZ.

Besides giving rise to one of the only decent memes, Sandal is apparently also the strongest character in the game. Watch in lulz as you enter the first floor of the last level to see a room full of dead darkspawn with a lone Sandal standing there with his usual blank expression. Want an explanation for how this retard is apparently the new Chuck Norris? Your answer: [[IDIFTL|ENCHANTMENT!]]<br />
<br />

== Combat ==
Unfortunately, you have to actually run around and fight things while waiting for another opportunity to convince your target to put out. Every character but one must fight using AI rules that you can set up. You can pause and take over any character manually, but only one at a time. So [[MMORPG]] players, you know those retarded DPS players that pull aggro, healers that wait until you're dead to cast a heal spell, tanks that are asleep on the job when mobs attack, etc? Well, in Dragon Age, you can have AI characters doing all the same shit.

Are the character classes balanced? Excuse me while I laugh for an hour or so. The Arcane Warrior mage variant can pwn anything in the game without NPC help and without player skill. Rogues can 'sneak' in front of a high level demon's face and moon him, without being seen. Anything else takes mad skillz.

== Structure & Plot ==
Map areas are gradually unlocked - this is no [[Oblivion]] or [[Fallout]] 3 for openness. There are side quests, all trivially simple. The main plot is mostly linear except for the old travel-the-world-recruiting-allies shtick, which you can do in any order. See Might & Magic 8, [[Oblivion]], etc, etc. At least there are 6 different beginnings to the story, depending on race or class.

Your choices can change the plot in the sense of what characters do and say, and who dies at the end, but you can't change what you have to DO in the final third of the main quest sequence. It's always the same except for who's in your party and what happens in cutscenes. Among other things, you can:
* Make Alistair [[BAWWWW]] and leave the party;
* Tell anybody EXCEPT Alistair to [[GTFO]] (although Morrigan will still reappear demanding to fuck somebody);
* Be [[an hero]]; 
* Make somebody else be [[an hero]], see [[Fallout]] 3;
* If you're a human noble female you can make Alistair king, marry him and be his queen - some fags have patched the game so you can be 'queen' as a MALE;
* Marry the previous queen, newly widowed, but there's no [[Secks]] scene so welcome to married life.

== Fandom and Trolling It ==
Most of the [[fandom]] is concentrated on [http://social.bioware.com social.bioware.com]. Here are some trolling suggestions:
* Find the Alistair fanclub and repeat anything from the above paragraph about him.
* There are some honest-to-god faggots who claim that Alistair sets off their gaydar more than Zevran does. Play them off against the girlgamers who jill to him.
* Start a [[furry]] flame against anyone who says he sided with the werewolves against the elves. Since these are usually the badass "evil" players, they will freak.
* Start a [[faggot]] flame against anyone who says he sided with the elves against the werewolves.
* Vote for Alistair or Morrigan in 'most useless character' threads.
* Saying Baldur's Gate or KOTOR is better than DA:O [[Truth|won't work]]. Choose a shit JRPG instead.
* Or, if you really want to piss them off, mention...

=== Return to Os-[[Retard|DURR]]-gar ===
[[Image:Cailan_penis.jpg|thumb|Even after death]]
Among the biggest pieces of drama in this game so far is among one of its biggest DLCs that could be considered simply as, '''[[RAEG|"WHY wasn't this in the game in the first place?!"]]''' aka '''Return to Ostagar'''. [http://greywardens.com/2009/11/new-dlc-return-to-ostagar/ Announced as far back as mid-November] and <s>[http://greywardens.com/2010/01/where-is-return-to-ostagar-victor-wachter-gives-answer/ STILL missing] after two [[bullshit|"quality delays"]]</s> '''NOT ANYMORE SEE UPDATE''', many of the fandom have begun to wonder if it will ever come out or if the [[erection|expansion]] of the series, '''Awakening''', will beat it come March. The part that really [[butthurt|gets in the craw]] of most of these asspies is the fact that the DLC technically ''was'' released on January 5th, and some people ''do'' have it and have basically told what you get and what happens. In fact, [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showpost.php?p=177175&postcount=56 thanks to An Actual Mexican on EDF] let's just get that out of the way now...

{{quote|'''YOU FIND CAILAN CRUCIFIED BY THE DARKSPAWN AND HAVE THE OPTIONS OF EITHER LEAVING HIM THERE, TAKING HIM DOWN BUT LEAVE HIS BODY FOR THE WOLVES OR THROW HIM A FUNERAL.
YOU FIND HIS ARMOR AND HIS FATHERS SWORD, BEST EQUIPMENT IN THE GAME BY FAR'''

'''BRING ALISTAIR AND WYNNE AND YOULL SEE THEM HITTING ON EACH OTHER
BRING LOGHAIN AND WYNNE AND YOULL GET BITCHFITS'''|Moar like [[LOL|An Actual Dickbag]], amirite?}}

You've just been saved $5. [[Dumbledore|Sound familiar to anyone?]]

=== UPDATE OMG?! ===

Quite literally mid-EDit, [http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/94/index/825185/1 it was announced] that the [[360]] is going to get it as soon as [[Last Thursday|yesterday]], the [[PC]] has a hacked copy of it, and the [[PS3]] [[loser|players]] are still [[BAW|crying]] even though they [[Slowpoke|FINALLY]] got it a week before [[Newfag|Awakening's]] release.


== Expansions ==

=== Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening ===

A huge waste of money which contains [[Shortcat|almost 2 hours]] of [[fapping|gameplay]] for around the original price of the main game. Part of the reason it's so short is the fact they level you up to [[win|level 18 by default]], which considering some of the other things in this "game," isn't such a bad thing. If you purchase this [[RAEG|you deserve to be shot several times in the face]] and are probably a [[necrophilia|necrophile]] and/or [[retard|a citizen of Amaranthine]]. More on all of that later...

'''PLOT:'''<br />
Assuming you didn't make a new character, which is a good idea because most armour you get from the old game suddenly fucking disappears on importing the faggot of a character ([[derp|and considering you get some of the best armor creating a new character, there's no reason NOT to]]), you begin as your [[faggot|imported character]] from the last game, having finished being a giant fucktard in Denerim and its surrounding areas. As a reward for saving the country from [[Arab|Darkspawn]] and [[FYIAD|a giant AIDS-Dragon-God thing]], you've been given the Arling of Amaranthine to command over, which once belonged to the scheming [[English]] asshole Howe before you shanked the bitch for causing [[Epic Fail|epic ruin]]. Of course, no one mentioned it was all a derelict shithole, and that Vigil's Keep was basically a slumlord's worst nightmare. '''[[You|WELL GUESS WHO'S THE NEW SUPER?]]''' And so, ever so pissed, you begin at the castle, clearing out the cockroaches, [[n00bs|riff-raff]], and oh yeah, Darkspawn, you have come to realize that, holy shit, [[Extreme Advertising|THEY CAN FUCKING TALK NOW]]. Anyway, some shit happens, [[derp|HOLY SHIT ORGHEN AND ALISTAIR ARE THERE]], and then the only woman you'll know for the first half of the game, [[Virgin|besides maybe yourself]], dies from the Joining. You then begin to help people who are utterly useless and are unable to complete even the simplest of tasks without help ("Hurr, we're fully-armed soldiers who can't clear out a [[Basement]] full of Darkspawn, durr!"). Really, that's the premise of the entire expansion - helping people in the Keep and [[San Francisco|Amaranthine]] who are fucktarded until you reach the end, at which point you fight a giant, tentacle-wielding skank with 8 [[tits]]. As you're about to deal the final blow, the game turns into a movie and doesn't even give you the courtesy to give you a quick-time event or ''something'' to make the game worth it's near-full price.<br />
<br />
<video type="youtube" id="1V1Xvzt300A" width="250" height="250" desc="Justice and Anders, [[faggot|catty lovers]]" frame="true" position="left"/>
'''CHARACTERS:'''<br />
You don't get to [[fuck]] any of them. At all. Nope. Why are you still even reading this? Fine, you want to know about the [[midget]] from the last game showing up again? Oh, the gay [[British]] mage who likes [[Kittens]]? No? How about the bastard son of the guy who's land you've currently [[USA|occupied in the name of freedom]]? Sorry to say they are ALL you'll know for most of the game - while capable, if not [[Steroids|over-powered]], characters, you spend the next 20-30 hours in a [[Mantrain]]. Then later on, after doing some exploring around the whole 5 places you get to go in the game, you'll find another midget (this time with [[tits]]), an elven version of Morrigan minus the being a whore, and an [[asexual]] spirit that takes over another Grey Warden's body. That's right, instead of a giant or a golem, and to make up for the lack of faux-sex in the game, they give you a [[zombie]], of which you'll probably only get to use twice unless you take him with you to kill the previously-mentioned 8-titted hambeast.<br />
<br />
'''SKILLS/CLASSES:'''<br />
Mostly just hacked improvements and lulz incarnate for some classes (Rogues get especially rape-worthy abilities such as [[Ghost Riding|"Ghost"]], a [[Slowpoke|Bullet-time mode for Archers]], and [[Speedycat|"Flicker"]]), and a few completely useless personal skills; unfortunately, you still need to master shit like [[Facepainting|Runecrafting]] anyway to make some weapons, so [[DO IT FAGGOT|get to it fgt]]. The new classes are just like the classes from the last game - grossly overpowered and since they give you free experience points to get your characters to equally level with your main, you can max out shit like [[AIDS|Blood Mage]], [[ITG|Reaver]], and the new shit like black person and [[God|Spirit Warrior]] without having to even kill anything for the first 30 minutes. As cool as some of these are, just remember that you'll only really need the first ability of any of the new classes, unless you want to just increase the [[rape]] factors.<br />
