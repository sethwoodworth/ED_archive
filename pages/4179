Jacknstock
{{Spoilers|text=Jacknstock is Aussieintn}}
'''Jacknstock''''s [[Powerword|real name]] is Jack Stock! Guess his middle initial!

[[Image:Auspuppet.jpg|frame|Also Jacknstock]]
[[Image:Ling head.jpg|frame|There once was an article that said written by ([[Power Word: IRL Name]] Ommitted) and gave aussieintn's email address as contact info and gave this picture as the editor's picture.  When found, the article was only in google's cache, but the picture remained on the server. This man is a jerk and a tool.]]

==The great conspiracy theory that most of ED's editors are one person==
Jacknstock was an ED admin [[at least 100 years ago]].  He has gone by many names on ED, all gaining adminship and all acting the same way.

How each [[sock puppet]] earned its beloved [[banhammer]] no one knows.  [[Some argue]] that ED's search function got broken after he hacked in and made some new accounts.  What is certain is that he wielded it like a black person with a taser, and spent all day deleting any article funnier than his bible length [[Plastic crap|Games Workshop]] article.  And being a [[fake editor]] and banning people like mad.  This has led to a great decrease in the amount of editing done on ED from a year ago.  He is believed to be hiding in a basement somewhere south of [[Kentucky]], painting barbie dolls to look like warhammer transvestites.

[[Some argue]] that he and [[User:Aussieintn|Aussieintn]] are in [[fact]], the same person.  Aussintn started slightly after ED began and Jacknstock started a month after.  Jacknstock worked up slowly with a few edits a month.  Likely the person behind them made 1 sock puppet a month, all of them gaining admin status.  This would mean 20 sockpuppets later, he would own a majority share in ED.  His plan was perfect until one day where he went [[batshit]] and [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=Jacknstock&page=User%3ACrayolacrime blocked Girlvinyl's husband]. This led to a [[lollercaust]] and [[User:Jacknstock|rainbow blinking LOL FIRED tags]]. Jacknstock later wrote about it [http://jacknstock.livejournal.com/1232.html in his livejournal].

But Aussieintn came at least 20 sock puppets prior to Jacknstock.  Through that time, there have been many sock puppets of him being admined.  Who is [[User:EdSysOp|EdSysOp]]?  Who is [[User:Anonadmin|Anonadmin]]?

[[Uncyclopedia]] in their ED article claim Aussieintn is [[Banaan]] (who was an admin until mysteriously vanishing and being de-admined, and suddenly after Jacknstock's downfall is an admin again with no explanation of what happened) and links to half of ED's sysops, this is led to the great conspiracy theory that most of ED's editors are one person, possibly infiltrated by the [[furluminati]].  What we know is someone found Jacknstock's [[Power Word: IRL Name]] and his picture and then posted it to the talk page of wikipedia's ED article, and later on, someone at uncyclopedia got it and was displayed in uncylcopedia's ED article until they bal337ed it.
