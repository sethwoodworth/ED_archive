Icon theft
{{elaw}}

All right.  Sooo... you just dropped the fat $15 lab fee at your high school so that you could get your fine arts credit requirement in "Commercial Art."  Wheeew ... you sure did work hard learning how to use the Clone Tool, Color Ranges, and Glowing Edges.  Man, you worked your fucking ass off and you didn't even have to stand up once and give a book report!  Congratufuckinglations!  You Win!  Instead of once again working your ass off to find an actual job working for an ad agency or a newspaper, you sit on your ass and make frivolous [[icon]]s for whatever [[fandom]] crap you're into.  What a waste of time.  Since you're a total [[attention whore]] and [[drama queen]] you've decided to post the [[icon]]s you've made in one of the indefinitely many icon communities on [[livejournal]].  You post them in a public space, making the request that, YOU MUST CREDIT MY USER NAME IN THE KEYWORDS!   Total and complete [[fucktard]]s think that this is a perfectly fine [[e-copyright]].  

Soon half of [[livejournal|el jay]] users are using your [[icon]] in one of the 79374937492347927349724 zillion [[Harry Potter]] [[slash]] communities.  Boy, don't you feel stupid that everyone on earth ganked the shit out of an [[icon]] that took you half an hour to animate in Image Ready.  Oooo it's sooo sparkly.  This makes you so enraged that you convince the [[LJ Abuse]] team that people are stalking you and stealing copyrighted works.  Since the [[LJ Abuse]] team smokes a lot of [[marijuana]] and still code in [[DOS]], they donâ€™t know shit all about shit.  

Icon Theft is also a great way to start ''a lot'' of [[drama]] with [[16 year old girls]].
