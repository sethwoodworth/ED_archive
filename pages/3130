[[File:Admin_Drama.png|thumb|The admin of the site, telling the the 13 year olds of funnyjunk the truth. Drama is sure to insue.]]

'''Funnyjunk.com''' used to be a [[pretty cool guy|pretty decent website]] for posting funny pictures and videos, but was eventually infected with the same cancer as /b/. It has many many retoasts, but most of which end up being funny, this site lost alot of OC and is bombarded with reposts, but then again the sites main goal is to post content that people view funny, why is that so bad?
<b>PROTIP:</b>The Admin's Phone Number is most likely 1(225)-289-2834.  Have fun! Make sure to thank him!

Truth: There is nothing funny, clever, interesting, or remotely humane about the shitstack that is "funnyjunk." The above explanatory paragraph was left to serve as an example of the finely distilled faggotry that runs rampant in this swamp. Middle school fucks and the like scrape the worthless leftovers from b/'s b/oot and masturbate over it like red-injuns masturbate to fire-water. The rest of their time is spent creating words like "retoast" to really put the aftertaste of butthole in your mouth. If you love the feeling of picking fursuit hairs out of your teeth after waking up in the ice box outside a 7/11, you'll love funnyjunk.

=="Funny" Content==

* '''Overused/Forced Memes''': Some of the content on funnyjunk consists of forced and overused memes, causing their glorious death on this and other sites. Some of the memes that have died on the internet with funnyjunk are RageGuy, Sparta, Over 9000, Advice Dog (and it's million fucing spinoffs). Since using dead memes is the only way to be voted up on funnyjunk, the website's front page looks like a fucking advice dog factory exploded.

[[image:NSFWFJ.PNG|thumb|The possibly [[fail|only]] good thing on Funnyjunk.com.]]

* '''Reposts''': Mildly humorous images that had the potential to have entertainment value, although thumb whores decided it would only be fair to post them over and over until everyone on the internet have seen the image.  Once the [[Facebook]] community has made a Like / Fanpage of the picture, your [[IRL]] community has seen the image about 3 months AFTER the internet decided that the fad sucked, and will think they are cool and start using it [[IRL]]. An example of this is posting [[Caps Lock|THE SAME FUCKING STARE DAD COMP EVERY DAY]]

* '''Original Comics''': Besides the forced memes, the aspies of funnyjunk make their own really, really, really, really, really fucking shitty comics. Every single comic is made with MS paint. No joke. The admin even made an MS paint tutorial for the website. Srsly. These Comics on range from [[unfunny]] to [[fail]], drawn by 13-year old boys consisting of overused memes in an attempt to make them funny. These comics will be posted on funnyjunk as if it's fucking [[DeviantArt]] and will be followed by the typical [[faggot|truthers]] who will say they're not funny or badly drawn, and the [[faggot|faggots]] who will try to defend the comic makers, only for the comic maker to post a comment that either says "[[BAWWWW|It's my style]]" or just "[[STFU]]." These comics will typically get 1000+ thumbs (Thumbs are the currency on Funnyjunk, the moar you hav, teh kewler u r), and as soon as they do a subsequent [[BAWWWWW|rant comic]] will be posted in response saying "Funnyjunk isn't funny anymore," (old news bro) drawn in MS Paint, and at the end they'll repost a picture in order to make it "[[lie|Funny]]." This cycle repeats indefinitely until the users have successfully completed their Cancer Orgy and go to bed

==How the cancer came to be==
[[At least 100 years ago]], Funnyjunk was actually good; but then gradually got filled with drama and unfunny newfags as with the rest of the internet such as [[b/]]. Fun Fact: Over the websites history, the background color has changed. Since all funnyjunk users actually give a shit about that.
*Yellow- Entertaining
*Green- Cancer sets in
*Black- Cancer has completely taken over. 50% MS Paint drawings by 13 year olds who think they are funny and 50% Images by

==Drama==

Teen drama has been arising in the site. Some [[fags]] who are "famous" decided they hated each other because they couldn't decide who was going to [[buttfuck]] who. So of course they decided to make pictures that had [[butthurt]] lulzy drama in its pixels. And of course when they're too lazy to make pictures they make comments on how the other is a faggot. Drama and lulz are sure to spark from the 13 year old masses. The fail can be witnessed here: [http://funnyjunk.com/showcomment/11951089] please make sure to not click the link if you value your IQ or any intelligence of any sorts.

The drama will most likely continue all the way up to next Thursday. Since the 13 year old masses are sure to get bored and go back to [[fapping]] to their mediocre [[NSFW]] section.  

==Internet Pranks==
FunnyJunk often prides themselves in thinking they were the ones pulled various internet pranks on [[faggot|****** ******]], such as:

* OMFG [[Faggot|****** ******]] IS DEAD!!!!111!!1ONE
* Sending him to North Korea (As well as sending the [[gay|Jo Bros]] to Somalia)

While yes, they did participate to some degree, they often jump into the game in the fourth quarter after the rest of the interwebs has had their fun.  When Funny Junk saw that [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10506482.stm| 4chan had gotten all the credit] for sending Mr.****** to Best Korea, they responded with "OMFG WTF OMGOMGOMG I CAN'T BELIVE 4CHAN GOT ALL TEH CREDITZ OMG NO IT WAS FUNNYJUNK!1!1!!" 4chan apparently thinks we were like, but in actuallity we were more like "Thank you 4chan" and we didnt really actually pay that much attention to it and had like 1-2 posts on it that got front page.
