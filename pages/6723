Quasidan's Penis
[[Image:Quasidan's condom.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quasidan]] and [[Girlvinyl]] having an admin meeting]]
One day, a man sat down with his ruler and his wang, and discovered he had a huge cock. 

'''Quasidan's Penis''' is quite possibly the most majestic thing on the [[Internets]], if not on the entire planet [[Earth]].  We at [[ED]] are honored to have such an object at our disposal.

Fact: The original working title for the Pixies song ''Gigantic'' was actually ''An Ode to Quasidan's Penis''.

==About Quasidan's Penis==

[[Quasidan|Quasidan's]] penis was discovered [[Last Thursday]] on a routine [[masturbation]] session.  Among the witnesses were a [[16-year-old girl]], his pet cat, and a copy of "Paigegirl Pussifies Portland."  

At 11 feet long and a girth impossible to quantify in modern mathematical language, [[Quasidan|Quasidan's]] [[cock]] is easily the largest on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], and quite possibly the entire universe. It was once used as the artist's scale model for a giant chocolate Easter-Day penis for [[Jesus Christ]].

Whenever [[Quasidan]] wants to [[Rape|share some tender moments with]] a [[whore|girl]] (or [[fag|boy]], [[furry]], black person or [[YOU|whatever]]) and if he is still sober, he will try and have some safe sex with his own special brand of condom. Although his [[Vagina|cock]] is flaccid in this picture; you can be sure by the look on her face that she can't wait for it!
May you have seen how gigantic a penis can be, but you will never see how robust a penis can be before you read [http://www.qigongpenis.com The Iron Penis/Balls.]

Other nicknames for it are "[[Babyfuck|Baby Crusher]]," "Vagina Destroyer," "Little Pepe," and "Pedro."
