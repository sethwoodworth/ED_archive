'''Raëlism''' is a [[Alien|UFO]] [[sex]] clone [[cult]]. [[You]] already want in, [[amirite]]?

Raëlians believe [[People|humanity]] (and all Earth life) have been created by an advanced alien race. They advocate [[Buttsecks|free love]], [[Fap|masturbation]], [[condom]] use, [[Atheist|atheism]], [[Mega ultra super genius|above average IQ]] as a voting requirement, the unionization of all African countries, cloning sciences, [[clitoris]] education and preservation, [[Diabeetus]] and the use of [[Lens Flare]].

==Raël Himself==
Claude was born on September 30, 1946 in [[France]]. Realizing he was a complete [[fag]], Rael ran away at 15 to be a male [[prostitute]] named Claude Celler, and managed to [[Tay Zonday|move away from the cock to sell records]]. <i>[[Funnelgirl|Madam Pipi]]</i> (Mrs. Toilet Attendant) and <i>Monsieur Votre Femme Me Trompe</i> (Mister, Your Wife is Cheating on Me) are two of his [[shit no one cares about|greatest hits]].

Before deciding to make shit up about aliens and [[Scientology|volcanoes]], Claude raced cars until the [[Jews|Elohim]] first visited him. He picked up the hobby again in 1994. When he's not fuckin' new age hotties or trolling world government, he plays a lot of [http://www.lfsworld.net/?win=stats&racer=rael01| video games].

==Beliefs==
In 1973 Claude met this [[You|John]] who offered to pay him in [[Jenkem|narcotics]], and took him up on it. After seven steamy drug fueled visits inside a volcano, this mystery solicitor had Claude believing that he was [[Yahweh]], a visitor from another planet and part of a [[Asian|superior race]] called Elohim. Claude certainly cracked when given large doses of hallucinogens , and kidnapped for free anal [[Rape|raepage]]. "Yahweh" convinced Claude to get in his "Spaceship" to have [[Fellatio|lunch]] with some of his fellow prophets, including [[Mormons|Joseph Smith]], [[Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Islam|Mohammed]], [[Jews|Moses]], [[Chinese|Confucius]], and [[Cthulhu]]. Claude was taught the following [[Lies|truths]]:

*The Elohim came to our planet 25,000 years ago, and through the magic of technology turned our dead, lifeless dungball of a planet in to a lush, diverse ecosystem that supports billions of species.
*[[Cake|God]] is a lie.
*[[Fap|Fapping]] links you to the [[Internets|cosmos]].
*[[You]][[Bisexual| should fuck anything with a wet opening as often as possible]].
*The [[Japanese|Elohim]] shall return in 2035, to teach us their [[Sex|technologies]].
*[[Cult|Money you work hard for, to the order of 10%, is actually theirs]].

Raël, as he henceforth decided to call himself, was given the task of creating an extra-planetary embassy. Rael has built this embassy in the outskirts of the hash capital of North America, and in his infinite knowledge and subtlety, dubbed it "UFO Land".

==Raël's Girls==
Raël saw how [[Scientology|LRON]] was recruiting celebrities to join his cult, and was immediately jealous. Feeling guilty about the whole Aliens in Volcanoes thing, he refused to bite Hubbard's style any further, and Raël formed his own master plan to recruit a group of people much more useful to the particular needs of his budding movement. [[Whores|Prostitutes]], [[Porn|pornstars]], and [[Stripper|strippers]] would have their own special place in the movement called '''Raël's Girls'''. Posing as a support group for industry women who have been mistreated, but wish to remain sex positive, the group recruits people who fuck for a living. Those [[sluts]] then recruit [[basement dwellers]] and daily [[Masturbation|fappers]] to a perceived lifestyle of sexual extravagance.

===In Japan===
Appealing to the Japanese sensibility, Raelians have gone [[animu]] in an attempt to snag them.

==Order of Angels==
Raël's own personal harem. Over 100 young girls have been chosen to give their beauty, both [[Cunt|inner]] and [[Anal|outer]], to Raël and the other 39 prophets, and the Elohim that will return with them. There are two classes within the order: White Angels, who serve Raël and his posse as servants, and Pink Angels, who function as [[Whore|concubines]]. It is likely that the three women who appeared with Raël in the October 2004 issue of ''Playboy'' belong to the Order. Those three women are his lover, his secretary, and the daughter of Brigitte, who you're about to meet.

Females are encouraged to wear colored feathers indicating their status to males. Some of them save their virginity for the Elohim, much like nuns await Jesus' ponos.

==Go Topless Day==
Part [[Trolling|political douchebaggery,]] part [[Kool-Aid|religious exploitation]] sold as [[Rape|liberation from sexism]] part fap fuel.  On August 23, 2009 Raeliens worldwide took to the streets with the message that they weren't being whores hard enough and joined in a chorus [[tits or GTFO]].  [[WBM|Beardfag]] was there, and took time out from trolling Scilons in order to roll tape and fap vigorously.  No coverage was provided in New York state because it's [[Truth|already legal to go topless there.]]  There was also no coverage anywhere else because [[SNCA|nobody gives a fuck]].

==Clonaid==
[[Image:Clonaid Egads.jpg|thumb|Brigitte tells you like it is.]]

Since Raëlism rejects the idea of a [[God|supernatural creator]], and denies the existence of an everliving soul, the movement looks to cloning as a means to eternal life. The movement gave birth to Clonaid in 1997 for the purpose of cloning human beings so they can "brain transfer" into younger bodies as needed (even Raëlians don't want to fuck [[Lemonparty|Geezers]]). This [[Trolling|Scientific]] wing of the church, run by Raëlian Bishop Brigitte Boisselier, is the faction responsible for [[trolling]] world governments through random claims of human clone successes. On December 27, 2002 Boisselier made the claim that the first clone baby named "Eve" had been born the day earlier. After promising proof, Clonaid took no serious effort to provide it. They continue to pull this stunt every few years when their recruitment rate slows down. Raëlian trolling history highlights:

*December 26th, 2002 in [[Florida]]. Birth of Eve. Caused [[America]] and [[France]] to outlaw the practice. serious business.
*Claim a cloned baby is born in [[The Netherlands]], causing the Dutch to ban human cloning.
*Claim a cloned baby is born in [[Good Korea|South Korea]], who immediately bans cloning with a ten year prison term. 
*Created the RMX2010, which does nothing but costs 10k. Clonaid lent one to a [[British]] Museum, but wouldn't let them open it. Very secret Magical Alien Technology, you know. 
*Operation Condom, in which a Raëlian [[trap]] drove around in a pink van and handed out 10,000 condoms to [[Canadia]]n Catholic [[high school]] [[student]]s.
*Began baptizing new Raëlians inside of St. Peters Basilica in Rome, successfully trolling [[Catholic|Catholics]] and tourists the world over.
*Participated in the [[Rational Response Squad]]'s Blasphemy Challenge on [[YouTube]].

==Clitoraid==
Raël's success has made him a little bit of a philanthropist these days. Money for nothin' and the chicks for free have convinced Raël to give back to the [[Niggers|world]], through '''Clitoraid'''. '''Clitoraid''' seeks to repair the '''Clitorises''' of women who had their '''Clitorises''' forcefully removed, especially in [[Africa]]. After working one '''Clitoris''' at a time, Raël has decided even more '''Clitorises''' can be repaired if he opens "The Pleasure Hospital" in Burkina Faso. Of course this '''Clitorical''' project requires funding, so please, Adopt a '''Clitoris'''. [http://www.clitoraid.org '''ClitorisClitorisClitoris''']
