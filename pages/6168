CONTACT: [http://www.youtube.com/user/LulzContingent LULZ contingent]
<br>
IRC: #houston (irc.partyvan.org)
<br>
WHEN: 11:00AM CDT, 15 March, 2008
<br>
WHERE: Church of Scientology of Houston (2727 Fondren Rd. Houston, TX 77063)<br>
WHAT to bring: Bring cameras, signs, fliers, WATER, money for f00dz, and masks ([[Guy Fawkes]] masks are recommended). 
<br><br>

It is important to keep things light-hearted as this will make us more approachable to the public. Serious messages should be simple and direct: Honk If You Oppose $cientology, Google Lisa McPherson, or any references to removing $cientology's Tax Exempt status are WIN. Easily-understood humor (such as caturday) will help combat $cientology's attempts to paint us as some kind of domestic terrorists. Anons who choose not to wear a Guy Fawkes mask should avoid turbans or other overtly middle-eastern garb, as this will play into $cifags' negative characterizations of us.
<br><br>
Black poster-board, using white or bright lettering for signs, shows up the best on film. White posterboard shows up best for passing drivers. Draw thick letters, they will be seen easier. Hobby Lobby is an excellent venue for posterboard, stick handles, and poster paint pens. They are on sale.
<br><br>
Remember above all else that the HPD and local media is ON OUR SIDE. Listen to and respect the cops. Be courteous to reporters, and don't say anything that you wouldn't want appearing on national TV. Don't act like a smug douchebag - this is Anonymous, not the World Workers' Party.
<br><br>
Many Anon ranging from geezers to silly sausages will be in attendance unless they [[die]] before the protest in a freak [[F40PH|METRO]] accident.

The rules for this protest will be very similar to the last one. Again, the HPD is on our side and very helpful to our cause; let's keep it that way. No violence. Stay peaceful. Don't be an asstard. Remember the [[rules]]:<br>
