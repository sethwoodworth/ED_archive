Google Video
''' Google Video''' is a boring site for hosting documentaries about how [[Jews did WTC]], boring [[camwhore|strip teases]], [[16 year old girl|teenage girls]] attempting to be [[funny]] with [[Plushie|stuffed animal]] shows and shitty remakes of popular videos, guys fighting like [[retard]]s, [[AMV]]s, boring demonstrations of [[Europe|eurofag]] motorcycles, [[fat]] and/or [[Fugly|ugly]] people, [[unfunny]] jokes from [[America]]n [[unfunny|sitcoms]] and [[Family Guy|shitty Fox cartoons]], [[Old meme|old jokes]], coke and mentos experiments, and other kinds of [[faggotry]].

A standard is that all videos have the lowest bit rate possible, and that they should be blown up to 10 times their original size with no respect to proportions.

==History (AKA why Google Video fails)==
*2005: Google Video lets you pre-buffer 15 '''minutes''' of video. <s> Google Video gets more popular than [[YouTube]].</s> <s>Youtube wasn't made til 2006 [[retard]]</s> Youtube was founded in Feb 15 2005.
*2007: Google Video lets you pre-buffer 15 '''seconds''' of video. Once that's gone you have to fight with the Flash control to make it load more, and then once it starts again, Google Video's Flash control loses all the previous video caching you have.  Everyone actively avoids using Google Video entirely. Even using a stream downloader only gets 15 seconds with no resume support and then Google Video just times out.
*2009: Google Video allows you to pre-buffer an '''entire show'''. We have only tested this up to roughly 30 minutes (watching the classic Naked Ape series. Still only worthy function is to watch interesting documentaries and studies. Nothing of value was lost.
