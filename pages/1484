The '''Chicago Cubs''' are an [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|incredibly bad]] Major League Baseball team.  This, on its own, would not warrant an [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] [[article]], but when you couple the fact that the Cubs suck so bad with the fact that the team [[trolls]] their own [[Fandom|fans]], the whole subject gains new light.  Not only do the Cubs rip the beating hearts out of their fan’s chests every year, they are also the subject of various blogs, forums, and websites where all you can hear are the wailings and moanings of their emotionally destroyed devotees.  

Whole [[Old Media|television shows]], [[The Internet is serious business|businesses]], and even [[Wicca|curses]] have been created to explain this phenomena, but the plain fact of the matter is that the Chicago Cubs will never win a World Series ever again…because God hates them.

==The Curse of the Billy Goat==
Cubs fans, tired of lifting their arms to the heavens and asking [[God]] [[WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY|'''“WHY?”''']] have formulated several [http://baseball.suite101.com/article.cfm/the_chicago_cubs_curse_continues curses to explain] their team’s lack of winning.  All of these curses, much like any other form of voodoo, are pure garbage.  The real reason why the Cubs repeatedly suck is because their owners, front office, management, and players are all dumbshits.  Seriously, spend some of that money you are bilking out of your fans and buy yourself a few good players.  You may just win something.

[[File:Cubs 16.jpg|thumb|This should qualify as [[child abuse]].]]
Mark Prior and Frank Thomas both die. God shows Mark Prior around heaven. They finally get to Mark Prior's new house. Its a smaller one bedroom with faded cubs banners and a few hats. God looks at him and says, "Be happy, most people don't even get a house". Prior then looks over on a hill and sees a huge mansion with White Sox flags, banners, jerseys etc.... And Prior says "Why does Frank Thomas get such a nice house and mine is so bad!" God says, "That's not Frank Thomas' house. Its mine".


ATTENTION FANS...ATTENTION FANS...WILL THE MOTHER WHO LEFT HER NINE KIDS AT WRIGLEY FIELD PLEASE PICK THEM UP?  THEY'RE BEATING THE CUBS 4-1 IN THE BOTTOM OF THE SEVENTH.

==Milton Bradley==

When one [[google]]s for images of [http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&safe=off&gbv=2&tbs=isch%3A1&sa=1&q=milton+bradley+cubs&aq=f&aqi=g3&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&start=0 "Milton Bradley Cubs"], they come across a story board. It almost seems unlikely that this wasn't intentional, whether it be by Google or [[google bomb|some really nerdy baseball fans.]]
