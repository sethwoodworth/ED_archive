'''Wallpaper''' is what covers up that ugly <span style="color:teal; font-weight: bold">teal</span> colour on your computer's desktop.  Wallpapers come in JPG, PNG and [[shit nobody cares about|Vellum]].  Before the advent of [[Computer Science III|technology]], all wallpapers had to be 256 colours and no more than 128x128 pixels large so that they could tile across your screen in a satanic [[epilepsy]]-inducing extravaganza.  Fortunately we are beyond such things and can now decorate our computer desktops with as much [[Paris Hilton]] and [[bestiality|horsecock]] as we wish.

==Types of wallpaper==
Approximately 101% of all wallpaper falls into the following categories:
#Shitty [[animu]] shoops done by [[bored]] [[13-year-old]] [[DeviantArt]] [[whores]]
#[[Porn]]
#[[Unfunny]] [[meme]]s
#[[MS Paint|Abstract art]]
#[[ALL_CAPS|LARGE BLACK LETTERS ON WHITE BACKGROUND]]
