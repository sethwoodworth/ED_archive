Lyndon Johnson (or L[[Blowjob|BJ]] by newfags) was a [[Texas|Texan]] politician and closet Jew who rose to power by appealing to [[zombies]], many of whom had previously felt disenfranchised. Upon killing [[John F. Kennedy]] with his own two hands in order to obtain yet another potential zombie voter, Johnson became president of the [[United States]] in 1963. He was re-elected in 1964 after portraying [[Republican]] opponent [[John McCain|Barry Goldwater]] as a war-monger. Then he hired mobsters to blow up [[Vietnam_War|Vietnam]], a task in which they were only partially successful, having been forced to rely on union labor.

==His epic failures==

Besides killing half of America in 'nam, LBJ decided not to run again for a second term because he knew he was completely fail. Even [[W|Bush]] was better than this faggot. It was also found that, like [[Mark Foley]], Johnson enjoy [[shota]] and would look for thm in the slums of Chicago, while JFK just went out pimping.
