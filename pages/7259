Saturday Night Live
{{potential}}

'''''Saturday Night Live''''' is live/living proof that [[The Simpsons|age does not make something better]]. What once had the occasional [[meh|kinda funny]] skit now has devolved into strange people doing stupid things for [[Family_Guy|overly extended sketches]]. 

For instance, let's take someone with an [[Mexican|amusing accent]] who isn't the [[black|negroes]]. While [[lie|most shows]] would only dare have this character as an incredibly minor character barely shown at all, SNL thinks the [[lulz]] aren't truly drawn out until this character is the central focus of a 10 minute sketch.

[[13 year old boy|Current watchers of present-day SNL]] often have problems identifying if the skit they are watching is funny with probable cause being mainly general retardation. Essentially, if SNL wasn't live and able to attract Jew it would be exactly the same as an early nineties all-teen sketch show on [[Nickelodeon]]. REMEMBAR ROUNDHOUSE??!?

If the skit contains any person who could be summed up as "angry ethnic person", then you are a retard for watching even a second more than it takes to determine it. If the skit contains [[Sarah Palin|Tina Fey]], then you are [[gay]]. (It must be true because it rhymes!) If it has Maya Rudolph, you are double gay and should probably check [[rape|this checklist]] to see if you are a danger to society. If you tune in specifically because you wanted to see your favorite actor performing in a hilarious hour and a half of variety [[comedy]], [[an hero|suicide]] might be for you. 

Now in its 35th year (though its roots date back to a local [[Jew York]] program called ''Broadway Open House'' in the early 1950s and also draws on [[Chicago]]'s Second City), ''Saturday Night Live'' is the third longest-running [[O_rly|entertainment]] program in US television history (after ''[[Chuck Norris|Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' and ''World's Deadliest [[Police]] Chases''). Tells you something about the [[American]] [[retards|public]], doesn't it?.

A Betamax tape exists of the very first broadcast of ''Saturday Night Live'' (then called simply ''Saturday Night''), featuring Paula Abdul welcoming viewers with the warning, "This show is going to make you puke." while Chevy Chase snorts an eight-ball out of her ass. So far, she has yet to be proven wrong. Over the years, SNL has shown to be a vital piece of information when it comes to determining how much of a life one actually has. If you have nothing better [[fap|to do]] on a Saturday night than watch guys make out or some fag try to defuse a bomb (as his movie bombed), [[you]] have no fucking life.

== Current Cast ==

The current cast of SNL contains various unfunny fucks. [[Jew | Andy Samberg]], whose trying to fit the role of SNL retard (previously held by [[Jew | Adam Sandler]] and Will Ferrell). There's also that fat nigger from that NICKELODEON fat burger bullshit. Wait, that kid is old enough now to be on SNL? Fuck, shoot me now. There's also probably a token spic on the show too, probably got hired as he was trying to steal some cheese off the kraft services cart.

== Lorne Michaels ==
Lorne Michaels has been in charge of SNL since [[last thursday|fucking forever]]. This is because he somehow managed to [[lie|convince]] the idiots at NBC that a [[Canada|Canadian]] was the only one qualified to judge good [[stupid|humor]]. Of course, since every generation of American says SNL sucks, he's probably not doing that great of a job. On top of that, NBC let him pick Conan O'Brien to replace Johnny Carson because they thought he knew what [[retarded|funny]] is. That not being enough, SNL has their own movie production studio that basically takes their long running shitty sketches into a box office bombs. This also creates work for such actors as Rob Schneider, who needs to fucking shave that vagina off his face.

== SNL Meets the Internet ==

Lorne Michaels made the first good decision of his life (aside from killing Phil Hartman and producing ''30 Rock'') by allowing skits and Digital Shorts to be [http://www.hulu.com/saturday-night-live posted on the intertubes]. As [[4chan]] has repeatedly proven, every time a tidal wave of [[shit]] is unleashed upon the internet, one is bound to find a few pieces of sweet, sweet corn.

== The Lonely Island ==

In December 2005, SNL created an [[unfunny]] meme among [[13 year old boy]]s and [[college]]fags, the rap song [http://www.hulu.com/watch/1397/saturday-night-live-snl-digital-short-lazy-sunday ''Lazy Sunday'']. 

[[Image:Happykids.gif|thumb|"The Lonely Island"'s Akiva as a child, practicing his dream of becoming a [[rap]]per with some other kid who may or may not have grown up to be [[famous]]]]

However, Jew gave a big middle finger to Lorne and live TV in general by creating Digital Shorts that dominated anything SNL has done in the past 20 years. He followed up on his original success with [http://www.hulu.com/watch/1596/saturday-night-live-dick-in-a-box-uncensored ''Dick in a Box''], [http://www.hulu.com/watch/47604/saturday-night-live-digital-short-j-in-my-pants ''Jizz in my Pants''], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yfISlGLNU ''I'm On A Boat (ft. T-Pain)''], and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisCkxU544c ''Like A Boss (ft. Seth Rogen)]. Just like a mildly attractive girl goes clubbing with her [[fat]] friend to look better by comparison, Samberg's decent material - a beautiful kernel of genetically-modified [[Illinois]] sweet corn in a pile of rotting [[feces]] - is suddenly hilarious.
