If you were tuning into '''''Squidbillies''''' and hoping for some hot Japanese tentacle raep porn you would be disappointed to know that ''Squidbillies'' is just a crappy animated show on a [[Adult Swim|crappy cable network]]. That is until sagging ratings had them introduce a new character, the Pedosquid. With the Pedosquid hanging around and introducing Rusty to [[loli|a new hobby]], will Rusty help the Pedosquid avoid the v&? Find out next week. Also coming this season Rusty goes to a cross burning after a [[Asia_LeeShawn_Ferguson|SquidNigger]] loses his head on a lolercoaster, at the meeting, [[klansmen]] mistake Pedosquid for a black person and hilarity ensues.  

==OH LAWDY IS DAT SUM ORIGINAL CONTENT ON MAH /b/?==

The Squidbillies is a new meme shitting all over /b/ mostly because it is easy as shit to edit a played out saying onto a drawn hat. For those of you without the shooping skillZ to blank out a hat but still want to make a version of the easiest meme to edit since [[advice dog]], you will need the [[Oh Exploitable]] version.

1.  Open Exploitable Squid in MSPaint<BR>
2.  Shoop an unfunny meme onto hat<BR>
3.  Post your unfunny pic on /b/<BR>
4.  ???<BR>
5.  Profit<BR>
