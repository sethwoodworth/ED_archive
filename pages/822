Balkans
'''The Balkans''' is a place synonymous with [[war]] and [[chaos]]. The tradition of '''Balkanization''' began with the [[Greeks]] who preferred tiny city-states to [[United States|unity and the success it brings]]. The only time the Balkans had a sense of stability was during the reign of the [[Turkey|Ottoman Empire]], but they made the mistake of not doing to the Greeks, Serbs, and Bulgarians what they did the [[Armenians]]. [[British|Lord Byron]] and fellow [[Britfags]] then decided to help Greece gain independence because it was supposedly the birthday of democracy, but they soon realized that the Greeks [[Iraq|don't give a damn about democracy]]. For a country often associated with democracy, modern Greece sent most of its history as a monarchy and a military junta (and don't forget about the [[Riots#Greece_2010|riots]]). 
The name '''The Balkans'''  came from a misplaced German, August Zeune, who attempted to study Geography and failed, defined it in 1808 to describe areas that were totally fucked up under Turkish [[Buttsex]] rule.


Today, the Balkans are made up of the following countries:

*[[Greece]] &ndash; the most misunderstood country in the region. They are empire-cravers, not democrats. They would like nothing better than to recreate the Byzantine Empire and be the majority in control rather than a minority buttraped by Turks.
*[[Albania]] &ndash; Misplaced [[Muslims]] who main exports are armed rebellions and civil unrest. The chief importers of these Albanian products are its loving neighbors Serbia and Fyromia.
*[[Serbia]] &ndash; Slavs kicked out of Russia. They are known for [[Genocide|ethically cleansing]] Croats and Albanians.
*[[Kosovo]] &ndash; The part of [[Serbia]] that told them to fuck themselves.
*[[Fyromia]] &ndash; A country whose inhabitants claim to be descendants of ancient [[Macedonia]]ns, but they was really some Bulgarian-Serbian hybrids who moved in and kicked the real descendants of Alexander the Great back to Greek Macedonia, which then became true and proud Macedonia.
*[[Bosnia]] &ndash; a bad mix of [[Muslims]] and [[Slavs]]
*[[Bulgaria]] &ndash; more [[Slavs]] who got lost
*[[Romania]] &ndash; more [[Slavs]] who think they are [[Romans]]
*[[Montenegro]] &ndash; more [[Slavs]] and [[Albanians]]
