Some argue
"'''Some argue''' (that)" is [[Wikipedese]] for "I think". It is a convenient way to bypass [[NPOV]] on [[Wikipedia]]. These are also known as "[[yiffing|weasel words]]". This is a favorite tactic of [[Faux News]].

[[tl;dr|Improper usage of weasel words can backfire, causing a "fact" to be as null and void as if someone were to say "in my opinion," inevitably causing your argument to be dismissed and looked at as speculation, which is not a appreciated in forums of discerning fact rather than opinion. In the event you were to be discovered using "some argue that," you can be shut down with one word your opposing debater, "sauce?"]].

* '''NPOV''': ''Some argue that George W. Bush is a fucking asshole''

* '''POV''': ''SAILOR MOON RULEZ!!!!!!!!!!1111111 LOLOLOLOLOL''
* '''NPOV''': ''Some argue that SAILOR MOON RULEZ!!!!!!!!!!1111111 LOLOLOLOLOL''

* '''POV''': ''The [[Jews]] secretly bred [[Natalie Portman]] as a half-breed Jewish princess to rule planet Earth under the reign of our [[Illuminati]] [[reptilian|reptile]] masters from planet Vulcan, using the [[Jedi]] powers she gained from having [[sex]] with Darth Vader.''
* '''NPOV''': ''Some argue that the Jews secretly bred Natalie Portman as a half-breed Jewish princess to rule planet Earth under the reign of our Illuminati reptile masters from planet Vulcan, using the Jedi powers she gained from having sex with Darth Vader.''

* '''POV''': ''[[Jews did WTC]]''
* '''NPOV''': ''<strike>Some argue that</strike> [[Jews did WTC]]''

* '''POV''': "[[You]] are a cocksucker."
* '''NPOV''': "Some argue that [[you]] are a cocksucker."

'''NOTE:''' "Some Argue" should not be confused with [[French]] Dadaist poet Sam Argeu.

==Variations==
Variations on the "some argue" concept can be used to insert an entire [[flame wars|flamewar]] into the article. Here are some important words to remember when conducting a flamewar inside an article, to keep it NPOV:

* '''Synonyms'''
** Purportedly
** Presumably
** Some suggest (or claim, posit, feel, think, believe, hold et cetera)
* '''Alternatives for some'''
** Many people feel
** Critics say
** Proponents/opponents believe
** Research suggests
** The vast majority think
** A small minority holds
** It turns out that (a personal favorite of renowned author [[Douglas Adams]])
* '''Key words and phrases'''
** However; although; but
** It should be noted that
** [[Logic|If... then; therefore; as a result]]

These can be readily interspersed with other ideas, for example, if you wanted to [[troll]] people by saying "Actually, water is dry," you might come up with something like [[TL;DR|this]] to put in your NPOV article:

:Proponents of the '''water is wet''' [[cult|doctrine]] or concept claim that their [[religion|belief]] is correct,<sup>[1]</sup> however, critics point out that the vast majority of the doctrine is false.<sup>[2]</sup>  Critics note that their claim suffers from [[circular logic]], and accuse proponents of using [[ad hominem]] to further their argument.<sup>[3]</sup>  Believers often lash out aggressively at those who point out that water is, in fact, dry.  "Wet" water is often an assumed position, by definition,<sup>[4]</sup> and therefore critics argue the proponent's argument is flawed, in definitional terms.<sup>[2]</sup>  [[Drug#Methamphetamine|Ice]], for example, is one of the 15 known crystalline phases of water<sup>[1]</sup> which, at -204&deg; C, is often described as dry at that temperature.<sup>[5]</sup>  As a result, proponents of the "water is wet" dogma are seen by some as ill-informed on the nature of water.<sup>[6]</sup>  The main proponents of this dogma work in water-related industry,<sup>[7]</sup> leading some to believe that the water is wet concept is more likely [[propaganda]].<sup>[8]</sup>
