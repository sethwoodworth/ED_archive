Hi res adventure
[[Image:The hobbit.JPG|thumb|right|QUALITY GAMING EXPERIENCE]]
'''Hi-res adventures''' are for philistines who can't deal with [[text adventure]]s because there aren't enough pretty pictures. 

In terms of [[nerd]] elitism, hi-res adventures are inferior to text adventures, but superior to almost every other option. The [[shit]] graphics quality ensures that you won't enjoy your gaming experience too much, and [[old school]] gaming is all about taking pride in frustration and boredom.

Hi-res adventures share many qualities with text adventures, because they're actually the exact same thing, except one has ugly pictures drawn by [[retard]]s with [[MS Paint]].
