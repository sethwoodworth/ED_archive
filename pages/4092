Internet newscast
An '''Internet Newscast''' refers to a "newscast" usually done by [[idiots]] for [[YouTube]].

== Structure ==
The structure of the Internet Newscast usually goes like this:
* Flashy graphics
* Waste of time
* ?????
* [[Profit!]]

Sometimes additional segments like gas prices and the top [[AOL]] searches can be added. Under no circumstances can actual news be given.

== Anchors ==
The Internet Newscast anchor must follow a certain code to be considered a true internet newscaster
# Speak slowly.
# Mumble often.
# Mispronounce Every few sentences.
# Don't form a coherent sentence.

== Studios and Sets ==
Internet Newscasts often needs sets, and those sets too follow a code:
* Go Green - Use as few lighting fixtures as possible.
* The Mirror - Adding a mirror is a great way to make it look like there is a room behind you.
* Cardboard - Build the set out of cardboard, to be lightweight and easy to relocate.
* News Desk - Use an existing office desk, a hunk of plywood, or an old door.

== Equipment ==
To make a truly respected Internet Newscast, you should always aim to have the best on air look. Some ideas are:
* 16:9 Widescreen - To give it that "HD" look.
* Cameras with On Screen Displays - People love to see the technology behind the newscast.
* Editing Software - [[Windows Movie Maker]] is excellent to give your newscast that [[1970]]'s charm. Pinnacle Studio can be used once your newscast beats out another newscast in the Interntet Nielsens.
