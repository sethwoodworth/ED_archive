Fitna
[[Image:Fitna film title.jpg|right|350px]]
<i>'''Fitna'''</i> was a fucking [[epic]] film made by Dutch politician [[Geert Wilders]] that was released on the [[internet]] sometime [[last Thursday]]. <i>Fitna</i> is one of a long line of films from the [[Netherlands]] that really [[Troll|piss off]] [[Muslims]] - except this one has more of a [[Pain series|shock image]] feel to it. It was [[OP|first posted]] on Liveleak only to be promptly taken off the server after the staff received death threats. [[Fitna#External_Links|See below for links]].

[[Image:Fitna3.png|thumb|right|Yeah! Fuck you freedom...wait, what?]]
<i>Fitna</i> is composed of readings of inflammatory and violent passages in the Q'uran intermixed with footage, newsclippings, images of violent acts by Muslims accompanied by Jihad videos and terrorism in action. We see video worthy of [[Ogrish.com]], including:
*The famous [[:Image:Mohammadlolz.jpg|Danish cartoon]] of [[Muhammed]] with a bomb on his head is shown and the fuse is lit
*[[9/11]] Jumpers/Planes Hitting Towers/Phone Calls
*The [[Spain|Atocha station bombings]]
*Dead contractors in [[Iraq]], being [[Pwn|dragged through the streets]]
*7/7 [[London]] Bombings
*Pictures of Muslims being [[racist]] in general
*The death by stabbing of [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3974179.stm Theo Van Gogh] (another Dutch director), along with his killer stating he would have done it all over again
*[[Nick Berg]] getting his [[Mujahideen Video|fucking head chopped off]]
*Churches being desecrated by Muslims
*[[Iran|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] declaring Islam supreme
*Complaints about how many Muslims now live in the [[Netherlands]]
*Honor killings
*[[God Hates Fags|Muslims hating gays]]
*Muslims hating [[feminists|women]]
*[[Moar]] executions & beheadings
*Some guy [[asking for it|ripping a page out of the Q'uran]]
*[[Pwnt|The Muhammed cartoon blows up!]]   
*Muslims just being all around [[douche]]s

If you can [[fap]] to this you are truly a [[sick fuck|great man]].

==<i>Fitna's</i> Release==
<i>Fitna</i> was released to [[liveleak]].com on March 27, 2008 at 6pm CET. By 9pm the [[Dutch]] version had been viewed [[over 9000|1.6 million times]]. The following day, however, the video was pulled from the website, with this explanation:
{{quote|Following threats to our staff of a very serious nature, and some ill informed reports from certain corners of the British media that could directly lead to the harm of some of our staff, Liveleak.com has been left with no other choice but to remove Fitna from our servers. This is a sad day for freedom of speech on the net but we have to place the safety and well being of our staff above all else.|liveleak.com's staff}}
By this point, however, thousands of people already had their copies and had plastered it across [[Bittorrent]] sites. Even [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2949546475561399959&hl=en Google Video] had gotten in on the fun.

By the 31st, LiveLeak felt itself ready to host the video again.
{{quote|On the 28th of March LiveLeak.com was left with no other choice but to remove the film “fitna” from our servers following serious threats to our staff and their families. Since that time we have worked constantly on [[buy a dog|upgrading all security measures]] thus offering better protection for our staff and families. With these measures in place we have decided to once more make this video live on our site. We will not be pressured into censoring material which is legal and within our rules. We apologise for the removal and the delay in getting it back, but when you run a website you don’t consider that [[muslims|some people]] would be [[pussies|insecure enough]] to threaten our lives simply because they do not like the [[Moralfags|content]] of a video we neither produced nor endorsed but merely hosted.|LiveLeak, Reloaded}}

==[[Drama|Reaction from Muslims]]==
The [[Muslim]] community had a fit after the release of <i>Fitna</i>. [[YouTube]] was banned by [[Pakistan]] after a trailer for <i>Fitna</i> went up on their website. The website run by the director was promptly shut down by the host. The [[United Nations]] Secretary General [http://studentpa.info/spip.php?article441 denounced the movie]. The director has had a fatwa issued against him by the friendly folks at [[Al Qaeda]]. Governments around [[Eurabia]] have gone into overdrive, warning their embassies to be extra careful. [[Dutch]] troops in [[Afghanistan]] have already been singled out for attack in the last couple of weeks - more attacks are anticipated. Protests have erupted from Denmark to Iran.

Amongst all this [[bullshit]], the Czech [[Nazi|National Party]] offered to host the video [[I did it for the lulz|to demonstrate freedom of speech]].
