Nitrobandicoot
[[Image:Lolli_Pop_by_nitrobandicoot.jpg|thumb|right|alt=No.|[[unwarranted self importance|BUY MY PRINTS BUY MY PRINTS BUY MY PRINTS.]]]]

Nitrobandicoot is an 18 year old [[camwhore]] TARTlet; whose gallery contains [[over 9000|over 9000]] worthless "arts", most being close-ups of her pastey face thrown into a photoshop filter, or of her sparkledog characters which she [[retard|couldn't be bothered]] to actually draw. Her sparkledogs are all delicately hand-crafted on a "Create a [[furry|Wolf]]" flash animation hosted by [[fursona|Kcoyote]]. Her characters, just like herself, also brim with originality - with names such as "Cloud", one could speculate what she could accomplish with such prevailing talent and vision.  Behind her stands a hoard of loyal [[weeaboos]] who will fight to the death for her honor, and who are willing to accept (badly written, poorly spelled) abuse from her in the process. 

[[Image:Number 73 i can t by nitrobandicoot.jpg|thumb|left|alt=No.|[[Do it faggot]].]] Like any mary sue, Nitro draws herself in a [[16 year old girl|grotesque vision]] of what she wishes to look like, and that's far from her [[tubgirl|actual appearance]]. Breasts magically jump cup-sizes when converted from photo to drawing on devianTART, and hers are no exception. When Nitrobandicoot isn't pumping out thousands upon thousands of [[sparkledog]] characters or dying her hair a [[faggy|trendy]] [[emo]] color, she is drawing herself having [[buttsecks]] with one of [[bukkake|three]] male characters that reoccur in her gallery.

Among her three male [[mary sue|mary sues]] is an angsty emofag named [[The Matrix|Neo]]. Neo is [[original|different]] from every other faggy emo character on deviantart because he has black hair with a red streak, and a black shirt with a skull on it... Oh wait.

== The Neverending Contest ==

Nitrobandicoot has been hosting a contest for her [[yiff|wolf characters]] for nearly [[nobody cares|2 years now]]. 

''Contestants are marked on "not beign lazy" (something nitro knows nothing about), and "drawing charactars dat not allot off other ppl hav drawn". Contestants are penalized on being shitty at art, coloring or drawing any wolf's markings inncorrectly, drawing two wolves that don't like eachother (because we're supposed to know, drawing less than 2 characters in each drawing, and submitting less than TEN drawings per user.''

Obviously this is just an elaborate trap to constantly lure in more fans, and thus more [[fanart|fan art]]. She has no problem letting her fans [[troll|know]] their art is pure [[shit]], and '''SO HELP YOU GOD IF YOU GET THOSE MARKINGS WRONG SHE WILL HUNT YOU DOWN, CHEW YOU UP AND SHIT YOU OUT.''' Amazingly, (and sadly) the contest has a staggering 65 entries. When the contest first began, the first prize was 30 drawings from [[omg|Nitro herself]]; since then, she's substantially lowered the prize, and now the winner [[buttsecks|receives]] 5 drawings from her. Truly worth the wait.

== CALL THE FUCKING COPS and ACCOUNT HOPPING ==

[[Image:Nitro vs cara.png|thumb|left|alt=No.|idk why ppl think my chars r bassd off me.. :'(]][[Image:Scene X Emo by nitrobandicoot.jpg|thumb|right|alt=No.|You wouldn't like him when he's angry.]] In April of '10, a stupid weeaboo by the name of WhirlIslands made the dire mistake of drawing Nitro and emofag Neo [[sex]]ing as a "gift art". As it would turn out, the fantard had mistaken her character for her, mostly due to the fact that they both had the same hair. (Hair is one of the only things that distinguishes nitrobandicoot's characters in the first place.) Although nitro appreciated the lovely gesture, she begged for the drawing to be taken down. The drawing had [[rage|enraged]] her "loving" boyfriend Danny, to the point where he COULDN'T EVEN [[Baw|LOG ONTO DEVIANTART ANYMORE]]. He actually threatened to have their accounts deleted and call the fucking cops, for he could not bear the thought of nitro having [[roleplay|sex with another man!]] :O

{{quote|"Knowing it is supposed to be me [[butthurt|hurts]] Danny. Well, it doesn't hurt him as much as it 
[[raeg|angers]] him. He's really [[The Incredible Hulk|not the type of person you want angry]], [[truth|trust me]]."|Nitrobandicoot on her abusive boyfriend}}

Bandicoot BAW'd claiming that the gift art in question ''didn't even look like her anyway''. When The fantard refused to remove the picture, instead changing it into an 'original' character, Nitro lost her fucking shit and [[woman|menstruated]] all over her screen; we can only assume Danny took his frustration out on her. Seeing as how DevianTART mods are not only [[lazy]] but kept hearing '''THEY [[irony|STOLE MY CHARACTER]] I [[DMCA|COPYRIGHTED]] THE COLOR PINK!''' every goddamn day, they [[lol|didn't do shit]]. The [[internet police]] however are hot on the trail of suspect.

'''THIS JUST IN!'''

Though if you look in the journal she posted on her main account, she posted her new account in the comments. Dumbass.
