'''MySpace trackers''' are non-existent tools used by [[phish]]ers on [[MySpace]] for scamming [[16 year old girl]]s into revealing their passwords. Every [[retard]] on the [[internets]] seems to think they have a million [[internet]] [[stalker]]s and want to know who visits their [[profile]], because they're just so rad people will go to that extreme amount of effort to [[rape]] them.  

It all starts when they read a [[MySpace]] bulletin saying, "Finally!  A [[MySpace]] tracker that works," or other such [[bullshit]]. Clicking on the link within the bulletin leads to a [[MySpace]] tracker website, where the clicker is then persuaded to do another click or two, and before you know it, the hopeless [[MySpace]] [[sluts]] have been [[phish]]ed and are back onto their [[profile]]s thinking, 'AAHHH HELL NO, where's my tracker, nigguh?' That's when they see a bulletin that appears to be posted by them, and they think, 'hey, I don't remember posting that!' They click to see what it is, and what do you know, it's the [[MySpace]] tracker advertisement!
