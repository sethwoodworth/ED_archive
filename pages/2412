{{potential}}

[[Image:Camw5-700390.jpg|thumb|right|Draco-Ookami. Note [[XBox|hueg]] head.]]Draco-Ookami (real name: Matthew Perry) is a 16 year old [[Wapanese|weeaboo]] [[Fag|faggot]] who blatantly [[Tracing|rips off]] other people's artwork and screenshots, claiming he used [[Lie|no references at all]]. According to his Electric Playground account, he lives in <strike>Vancouver, BC,</strike>Banff, Alberta, [[Canadia|Canada]]. He thinks he is t3h s3x & t3h aw3som3 artist so he keeps drawing himself and all his male characters shirtless all the time. He also thinks he's some shitty [[Fucktard|fucktarded]], [[goth]], [[wolfaboo|dragon wolf demon]]. 

=== About Draco ===
----

Originally joined DeviantART under the name of DracoBlazer, and got banned a few months later for "[[Internet stalking|inappropriate advances towards female users via notes.]]"
A few months later, he made new account called Draco-Ookami, and a few more months after that, he got banned yet again, around the beginning of January 2008, for [[Internet stalking|unknown reasons]]. He claims to not know why he [[Homosexuality|draws guys shirtless]] so much. Thinks he's [[unrealistic expectations|good]] at everything in the world. Calls his [[Crap|crappy]] [[Disney]] [[Fanfiction|fanfics]] "books" and gets mad at people for saying otherwise. Pretends to be romantic to try to get into any girl's pants but has been [[You fail it|unsuccessful]] thus far. His email address is [[Raid|romanticdude@hotmail.com]] Unfortunately it appears to be the only way to raid him at the moment since he hasn't yet made a new dA account. He probably will make another within a couple months.

[[Image:Dracoyaoifaves.jpg|thumb|right|Draco lieks yaoi]]'''Other fun facts''':

He broke up with a [[No girls on the internet|girl]] because she was bisexual.

He's going to cosplay as his OC at an [[Animu|anime]] convention.

[[Prostitute|Sucks other people's dicks]] to get them to color his "art" for him because he's too untalented to do it himself.

Thinks he's [[Goth|goth]].

Hates [[Emo|emos]].

Is an emo.

Wants to be a [[No girls on the internet|Japanese girl]] so he wouldn't have to be ashamed of liking men and also could be [[Wapanese|kawaii desu ne~ ^_______^]]

May go by the name of DracoBlazer, Draco-Ookami, or Draco_The_Ottsel.

=== His Characters ===
----

'''Himself''': A mixture of a [[Gay|gay]], [[Goth|goth]], [[Emo|emo]], [[Wapanese|weeaboo]], [[fag|faggot]]. Has a [[Death Note|death note]] and [[WTF|looks like L and Light's lovechild]]. Also, the shinigami that follows him around always asks him for black person.

'''Draco''': [[Fag|Inuyasha]] with Miroku's personality and alternate colors.

'''Angel''': Her appearance always changes to match his current girlfriend. If he has no girlfriend at the time, he makes up an [[Insane|imaginary]] one.

'''Jinsoku''': A [[Bleach]] shinigami with a [[Fucktard|made up kanji]] on his captain's coat rather than a number. Also, he isn't a captain. He only has a captain's coat because one of the characters gave it to him because he felt sorry for him. Loves Rangiku('s [[Boob|huge rack]]) but she leaves him after she finds out he has no [[penis]]. Has the ability to turn into Barney the Dinosaur.

'''Tsume Oran''': [[Final Fantasy 7|Vincent Valentine]] with alternate colors.

'''Sparx''': Rip off of [[Shit nobody cares about|nosleepjinx's]] character, Jinx.

=== "Angel" ===
----

Can't go one day without having a girlfriend. Also, they're always internet relationships because any girls who see him IRL immediately [[vomit]]. Sometimes he tries to get more than one gf at once but [[You fail it|fails]] [[Emo|miserably]]. Always gives them the nickname "Angel" - probably because he's worried he'd call them the name of one of his ex-girlfriends by mistake. [[Some argue|Many speculate]] that the reason he can't manage to keep a relationship with a girl is being he's actually [[Homosexuality|gay]]. There is an awful lot of [[Yaoi|yaoi]] in his faves on DeviantART to back up this theory along with the many badly drawn shirtless guys in his [[Cunt|gallery]].

Apparently certain criteria must be met for a girl to be qualified.

{{quote|I've been thinking. I think me and Kyra have to go our separate ways. I...I just don't want any pain in my life anymore. she just doesn't understand how important she is(was) to me. so[[...|.....]]it's over between us. Now, you might be thinking that i'm gonna [[an hero|kill myself]]. well, i can't. because [[Unwarranted self-importance|i mean so much to you guys]]. and i don't want you all to feel pain. but i do need your guy's help in a little mission of mine. I need your help in finding me a girl on DA. I know this might sound weird but this is the [[Lulz|only way i'll get a gf]]. all and i mean ALL the girls in my town or near me will NEVER date [[Ugly|me]]. so, this is what i want in a girl:

1. likes [[Danny Phantom|DP]] and [[bestiality|dragons]]

2. a DXS supporter

3. [[Man The Harpoons|slim fiqure (don't ask why)]]

4. age 14 or 15

5. a [[Slut|wild/naughty girl]] (check my pic labeled Summer Heat to know what i mean)

6. NOT [[EMO]] ( [[emo|i]]'ve had bad expeirence's with them)

7. actually wants a BF

8. has nothing against [[Lulz|long distance relationships]].

9. does not have a crush on [[LOL WUT|Danny Phantom]]

10. [[Hipocrite|wants personality not looks]]

11. likes [[bullshit|romantic,sweet and kinda]] guys


NOTE: NUMBER 5 IS IMPORTANT!!! YOU MUST LOOK AT "[[whore|SUMMER HEAT]] PIC TO SEE WHAT I MEAN. IT IS IN MY [[Cunt|GALLERY]].


if you guys find any girl like this(or meets most of the qualities), PLEASE NOTE THEM. tell them about this but don't make it sound like [[truth|i'm desparate]]. tell them to note me. and if you think your this type of girl, note me so we can talk and get to know one another.
NO LYING, YOU MUST TELL THE TRUTH!!!!

THIS IS NOT A CONTEST!!!!!


thank you guys, i know i can count on you.|Draco-Ookami, unable to "fiqure" out that no female on the planet would want to date him}}

=== Raid ===
----

The following quotes are from a raid over msn and deviantART. Pretending to be interested in him, Anonymous tricked him into a fake relationship and hilariously bad cybersex. (Not like there's any other kind, [[amirite]]?)
{{quote|so, tell me, once we know each other better, would you wanna make out naked or clothed?|Draco-Ookami}}
{{quote|awww sweetie. mind if i call you angel?|Draco-Ookami}}
{{quote|and in my dream, we made sweet love to each other. i kissed your whole body. and you said "ooooooh matt, oooooooh yes, oh yes....sex me up!"|Draco-Ookami}}
{{quote|hey...do you wanna have something called [[Cyber sex|cyber sex?]]|Draco-Ookami}}
{{quote|noohere...let me get you warned up..*takes off shirt*oooooooo|Draco-Ookami}}
{{quote|[[BDSM|Smack me]] baby I'm a bad boy|Draco-Ookami}}
Later, Anon created another fake girl named Taylor and lured him in with that account as well, only to have the other account appear to think she was being cheated on and then breaking up with him. Then came the suicide threats...
{{quote|fine then, if you excues me, i'm gonna [[Lulz|slit my throat]].|Draco-Ookami}}
{{quote|i'll be waiting...and crying...and bleeding...|Draco-Ookami}}

[[Hipocrite|And he says he hates emos.]] [[Lulz]].
Also, the "relationship" only lasted 28 hours. I guess he really thought he was gonna get [[Secks|laid]] that time.
