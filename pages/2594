'''Edarem''' (born September 27th, 1932), also known as ''"The Creepy Old Man"'', ''"The Schnozz"'' or ''"The Singing Sex Offender"'', is a 78 year [[old]] man (<s>currently</s> LOL JAILED!) making the rounds on [[YouTube]]. His real name is '''Edward Muscare''' (sometimes '''Edward J. Vianney''') and he's a [[Josef Fritzl|registered sex offender]] in the state of Florida. In his younger years, Edward used to present a children's show on KNXV-TV called ''Friday Night At The Frights'' and went [[sockpuppet|under the guise]] of "Edmus Scarey". Previous to this, Edward hosted shows for KSHB-TV in Kansas City. Muscare abruptly left his life in television [[grey area|under cloudy circumstances]]. 

Edward enjoys such things as letting dogs bite his body, grinding axes with a grinder, singing old Roy Orbison songs and is a fan of the TV series ''[[Zach Braff|Scrubs]]''. He is currently making YouTube videos at a very fast rate, several a day sometimes, making people like [[Chris-chan]] look even more like lazy fat bastards by way of comparison.

Due to his handiness with tools, his criminal record and the fact that he is living (and will die) alone, he is quickly becoming adopted as [[g|/g/]]'s official mascot.

Edward has two convictions in the state of Florida and one in South Carolina. His first conviction occured in 1986 for [[rape|sexual battery]] on a 14 year old boy.
His second conviction was in 1987 again for sexual battery on a victim 12 years or older without using enough physical force to cause [[butthurt|serious personal injury]]. His last conviction was for failing to register as a sexual predator. 

So apparently Edward likes 'em [[shota]], doesn't like the [[BDSM|rough stuff]], and does not feel there is necessarily anything wrong with performing sex acts on minors.

==Disappearance and Phil Stevens==

Sometime in early May 2009, Edarem uploaded one last video before disappearing from YouTube for a month and a half. Due to his numerical age falling somewhere over 95, many speculated that he had finally keeled over and his dogs had consumed the corpse.

On June 24th, however, a new video was suddenly uploaded to his account by a man claiming to be an old friend of his named Phil Stevens. He mentioned that Edarem no longer had a computer, but neglected to explain why. He then stated that Edarem would supply him with DVDs of his videos to upload to the account. Why Edarem kept DVDs of his own videos remains a mystery. However, it can be argued that Edarem was, perhaps, wise to the likelihood of abruptly losing said computer, given that his television career-as mentioned-ended just as sporadically and under similarly [[gray area|cloudy circumstances]].  

To this day, Phil Stevens (as he continues to refer to himself as, rather than just Phil) has been supplying the loyal Edarem fan base with the bootleg Edarem videos ripped from the DVDs. He also keeps a [http://phil-stevens.livejournal.com/ blog] that he promises to use as host for Edarem's  transcribed autobiography, though he hasn't updated it since late June. 

What remains ambiguous is a) is Phil Stevens real or some product of Edarem's delusion and b) is Edarem still alive? Because Edarem's autobiography claims that his computer was confiscated by the Fuzz because, presumably, he'd only use it to supply himself with gratuitous amounts of kiddy porn, there can be no concrete evidence that Edarem is still alive because the videos being uploaded could be months old.

All the Edarem fans and trolls have to rely on is the word of Phil Stevens, who [[sockpuppet|may or may not be a real person.]] Regardless, we all knew that Edarem had a well-earned spot on the ED list of those who would die alone, and more than likely has already fulfilled said prophecy.

== Edarem gets [[V&]] again ==

Sooner or later, all good things come to an end. On the 21st of September, the [[Party Van]] paid a visit, and Edarem was sent back to the pokey for another vacation. It turns out that [[South Carolina]] had a law aganst [[Pedophilia|secks offenders]] having [[computer]]s. Edarem [[Fail|didn't know that]]. In May, 2009 after he'd become an [[internet celebrity]], the [[Cops|popo]] found out and [[pwnt]] his 'pooter. The [[lulz]] stopped as Edarem was warned not to play around on [[JewTube]] any more. Ed recruited his buddy, Phil Stevens to upload his vids.

[[Lulz|Sadly]], the South Carolina police didn't like that and, as his probation was originally imposed in [[Florida]], they sent him back there, where a [[Judge]] busted [[buttsecks|his ass back to jail]]. Later on, he'd be denied bond and would be held over for another month.

Right now, the [http://offender.fdle.state.fl.us/offender/flyer.do?personId=2530 Florida Department of Corrections] site places him in '''551 W MAIN ST, LAKE COUNTY JAIL, TAVARES, FL 32778-3125, LAKE COUNTY.'''

On January 9th, 2010, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr81X_6igk8 this video] was uploaded to Edarem's account revealing that he had been sentenced to five years in jail for violating his probation. Bets are now being taken on whether our hero will live through the sentenced time period to make another YouTube video. Let's face it folks, at 106 years old, the odds are against him.
