'''SoSuave.net''' is a message board community that encourages young men to deny their [[faggotry]] by sitting at a keyboard and banging out pure apocryphal [[shit]] about the [[sex]] lives they wish they were having with nubile young women [[unrealistic expectations|they can't possibly attain]], and also advising other [[nice guys|"young studs"]] on how to have the same lack of life and [[fapping|masturbatory]] fantasies. [[Lulz]] are immediately apparent when one happens on threads like '''[http://www.sosuave.net/forum/showpost.php?p=1118827&postcount=1 this]''', where the little "Don Juans" (as they refer to themselves) are shitting their pants over the possibility of being [[troll|trolled]].

==Anatomy of the Don Juan==
"Don Juans" prefer to act as if they are leaving a string of broken hearts and longing [[cunt|pussies]] in their wake as they move from one [[loli|"conquest"]] to the next. Reality could not be farther from this. Typical Don Juans are [[13 year old boys]] who hold the lofty aspirations of one day becoming [[manchild|full-grown]] [[chavs]], who will no doubt be found in any given club on any given Satuday night looking for their next mealticket for [[usi|bragging-rights]] (not to mention access to her Visa).

The Dons are inherently insecure and unable to visualize being attached to one [[woman]], since they've lived their lives watching one parent or the other hook up with an endless string of [[Paris Hilton|coked-out failures]].

It goes without saying that there is an inherent level of [[faggotry]] present among their activity, the same kind that can be seen by the football team bragging about how big their dicks are, and definitely fueled by the same insecurities. The average Don Juan uses these behaviors to overcompensate for his lack of any actual experience with [[hookers and blow|dating]], and [[some argue|psychologists agree]] that this is no less than a precursor to full-blown [[homosexuality]].
