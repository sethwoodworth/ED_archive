[[Image:Ebonics-inside.jpg|thumb|This is a clear indication of a Class VI infection of [[black|The Black]].]]

'''Ebonics''', also known as ''Nigga Speak'' or "Nigganese", is a language spoken by [[poor]] urbanized [[black people]]. In the 1990's, the black person school district tried get more Jewgolds by making it an [[double nigger|instructional language]]. It is also used by middle-class white boys where much of which [[13 year old boys|being 13 year olds]] are trying to convince others that they are [[wigger|not middle-class white boys]].

As part of your local curriculum, teh Ebonics can be learned as a second language from any local Nigga by the corner. Give em' a bucket of KFC and you're set 4 life, homie.

Although its origins are uncertain, there are some [[Fact|scientific studies]] showing that Ebonics had originated from Niggas trying to speak English with a [[French]] accent, albeit with little finesse.

Fortunately, [[Apes | Niggas]] usually only babble with each other when they apparently feel like the other person would understand. On the occasion, they might attempt to babble to humans and you may encounter one trying to ask you for head. In that case, it is advisable to take a defensive posture (likewise when confronted with an aggravated animal) and ask him to repeat himself as slowly and clearly as possible.  If he babbles incoherently to you again, try the following response: 

{{Squote|I don't have an extra cigarette, I'm not interested in buying illegal drugs, and I don't have spare change, and I don't know where the nearest [[KFC | KFC]] is located.  If you're trying to rob me, I have a loaded .45 in my pocket pointed at your fucking balls. black person |[[You | You]]}}

No matter what the Nigga was trying to convey, this usually covers all bases.

A variation of the above in which niggaspeak is combined with [[leetspeak]] to an even worse effect. This results in screen names like ThugL1f34Eva, B1tch514pp3r and Undaprivilegedminorit33.

==Bill Cosby on Ebonics==

{{Squote|Brown Versus the Board of Education is no longer the white person’s problem. We’ve got to take the neighborhood back (clapping). We’ve got to go in there. Just forget telling your child to go to the Peace Corps. It’s right around the corner. (laughter) '''It’s standing on the corner. It can’t speak English. It doesn’t want to speak English. I can’t even talk the way these people talk. “Why you ain’t where you is go, ra,” I don’t know who these people are. And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk (laughter). Then I heard the father talk. This is all in the house. You used to talk a certain way on the corner and you got into the house and switched to English. Everybody knows it’s important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can’t land a plane with “why you ain’t…” You can’t be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth. There is no Bible that has that kind of language. Where did these people get the idea that they’re moving ahead on this.''' Well, they know they’re not, they’re just hanging out in the same place, five or six generations sitting in the projects when you’re just supposed to stay there long enough to get a job and move out.|[[Truth|This black man knows where its at.]]}}
