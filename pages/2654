'''[http://encarta.msn.com/ Encarta]''' is much like the evil [[Wikipedia]] except instead of being edited by [[lusers|everyone]], it is all written by [[Bill Gates]]. This means that there is a considerable amount of propaganda for [[Nazi mysticism]] and  buying [[Windows]]. If you have problems [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Searching|searching]] then you will be helped by [[Clippy]], whether you are using Encarta to write a letter or not.

== Comparison to Wikipedia ==

Unlike Wikipedia, Encarta is not free. A few articles are free to read for everyone, but to be able to see anything actually useful you must pay [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100 dollars]]. Like the Wikimedia foundation, Encarta also includes other sections such as:
* Dictionary
* Thesaurus
* Atlas
* Multimedia
* [[swap.avi|scat pornography]]
* Quizzes

== CD Version ==

[[Before the internets]], Encarta was a computer program the you would purchase. It included useful material to help people study and [[research]], and included educational games such as MindMaze and [[Counter-Strike]]. But the program results to be a complete piece of useless shit, since no useful information can be found on the entire cd, if you want to make encarta a little useful, you have to download at least one trillion of updates. Now that there is the online version users have to pay to realistically use, new versions of the Encarta program aren't pushed as much since they get [[Warez|cracked]] the moment they come out.

== Encarta Instant Answers ==

Encarta Instant Answers is a bot for MSN that allows you to quickly ask questions and get answers on topics ranging from "What is the capital of [[France]]?" to "Where is Paris?" Anything more complex than this will result in it opening Encarta for you in the activities pane and then asking you to pay for any fucking information, even if you ask it stupid questions, it will not know shit so it will open encarta, if you insult it, will say somethin like "if im not mistaken, shakespear was the first one sayin that"
