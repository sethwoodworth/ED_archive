Thousands of anonymous citizens in hundreds of cities world-wide took to the streets 
at 11 a.m. local time on Saturday, April 12th in a peaceful protest to launch "Operation Reconnect".  
Operation Reconnect was an initiative designed to bring together families who have been torn apart 
and injured by the Church of Scientology's Disconnection Policy.
 
The Internet collective known as Anonymous, and its associates in Project Chanology 
gathered before Scientology organizations around the world for the third time in as many 
months to educate the public about Scientology's practice of Disconnection.  The 
Disconnection Policy isolates Scientologists by requiring them to stop all communication 
with family members or friends who are critical of Scientology.  This protest was also an 
attempt to let those still inside Scientology know that they are missed and loved by their 
families and friends, who want them to return home.

The Anonymous Movement has become a widespread and unprecedented initiative that is 
free of leadership and has become a cultural phenomenon.  Known for their Guy Fawkes 
masks, suits, and party-like protests Anonymous has been widely featured in print, 
broadcast and internet media.  Anonymous has been called a "Cyber Vigilante Group" by 
The Toronto Sun, "Internet Activists" by The Economist, and "...the latest thorn in 
Scientology's side" by Newsweek.
 
Despite worldwide non-violent protests by 7,500 people on Feb. 10th and more than 
10,000 on March 15th, the Church of Scientology insists upon calling Anonymous "cyber- 
terrorists [...] reminiscent of Al Qaeda spreading anti-American hatred and calling for U.S. 
destruction."
