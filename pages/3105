{{moar|lulz & pics}}

'''FTP''' is '''File Transfer Protocol''' used in uploading or downloading files from the [[Internet]] in certain amount of time. Sometimes [[Truth|it takes longer to download than to upload]], which can relate to the abstract size of the file. It is typical to remove all redundant bits from the file before downloading. In uploading it does not matter, as the person who does it does not need to download it any longer.

There are several FTP programs that act as the ''FTP Servers''. Most known FTP applications are:

*SFTP (or Straight FTP)
*Disgusting FTP
*Macho FTP
*Pro FTP'''+'''
*GNU FTP

Ftp is not used for downloading stuff today. It's useful as a protocol, which enables the user to upload things such as websites edited using wysiwyg editors.
