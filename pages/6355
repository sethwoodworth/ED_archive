A '''personal message''' (also '''private message''', both often shortened to '''PM'''), is (according to [[Wikipedia|TOW]]) like an [[email]] sent from one user to another user. They can be sent on [[forums]], via [[social networking]] services such as [[Myspace]], or even through primitive chat programs such as [[IRC]]. In ancient times, these messages were typically intended for the eyes of the recipient only, as they would often disclose [[Docs|highly sensitive, deeply personal information]].

In today's [[Web 2.0|modern world]], with the existence of comments on [[YouTube]] and direct responses on [[Twitter]], PMs are downright antiquated, and are usually sent by mistake by those who are unfamiliar with how the [[Internet]] works. If you are accidentally sent a PM by a helpless [[newbie]], it is your duty to fix their mistake by re-posting it publicly for everyone to see, the way they [[obviously]] intended for it to be read.

==In Trolling==
A common tactic [[trolls]] use to destroy their targets is to [[bait]] them into confiding in them, and convincing them to disclose their [[Fursona|deepest, darkest secrets]] via PM. Having been delivered the juicy dirt, a troll should [[screencap]] said message and post it on [[ED]] for all to see. You may receive bonus points for sending another PM to the target linking to the aforementioned screencap, so they may contemplate becoming [[an hero]] or try desperately to [[delete]] it from the [[Internet]]. Of course, as it is impossible to permanently delete anything from the internet, they will have no option but to become an hero when they realize their efforts are futile.
