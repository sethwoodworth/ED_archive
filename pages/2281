Discordianism

Discordianism is best described as a religion, [[wat| apparently]]. Invented by a [[Star Trek| Star Trek nerd]] and two filthy [[Hippy| hippies]] [[last Thursday]] when they got bored playing imaginary video games, it is, to nobody's surprise, almost 100% bona fide [[bullshit]], and just like most [[Flying Spaghetti Monster| bullshit]] [[Scientology| fucking]] [[Church of the SubGenius| religions]], it has a bunch of [[retard| retards]] who actually take it seriously.

The basic idea of discordianism is that all religions are false. You can probably see the problem here. Yes, the people who made the religion decided to announce that all religions (including theirs) are false. This is a classical case of [[doing it wrong]], and is indicative of everything you need to really know about this subject.

==The Five Commandments==

In his book, [[tl;dr| Principa Discordia]], [[virgin| Malaclypse the Younger]] made some rules that everybody who follows his religion has to follow. They reek of [[oxymoron| faggy hipster]] 'wit' and as a result [[shit nobody cares about| I shan't be posting them here]], and it's not because I don't want to read that book.

Adherents of the propaganda and other [[crap]] associated with this ploy, most notably the toilet paper known as the [[shit| Principia]] [[Gay| Discordia]], fall into 3 distinct groups. It is theorized by some that these are phases that each Discordian must go through on their path through life; these theorizers are sometimes known as Wicca and are ruthlessly mocked by actual people.

[[Fanboys]], better known as asocial virgins, are those oh-so-edgy people you occasionally see on Internet forums, cracking inside-jokes for the benefit of their secret clubhouse religion. They don't seem to realise that everybody already knows about Discordianism, they just decided it was really stupid and went off to listen to Justin Bieber instead, which shows the average intelligence of the discordia fanboy, really.

[[Hipsters]] are now able to apply a dose of Apple iIronyâ„¢ to their tastefully post-modern worldview, chuckling over what were once worrisome logical contradictions in their thinking, and in so doing transforming themselves into giant walking cool-badges.

[[Shit Nobody Cares About| Robert Anton Wilson]], also known as 'People who actually think this might be true, but don't shout about it'. This makes them the most dangerous breed of all. RAW is regarded to be the king of the discordians, [[USI| despite having a head size approximating Jupiter]]. RAW is what all true Discordians aspire to one day reincarnate their sorry asses backward through time into. The last sentence, most likely written by a discordian, is all the evidence you need of the utter gob-smacking [[retard|fucktardedness]] of this particular group. Also the author of [[tl;dr|The Illuminatus! Trilogy]].

==Drama involving Discordians==

None. Absolutely none whatsoever. This isn't because they're chilled out or laid back or anything like that; [[truth| they're just that boring and lazy]]. Trying to avoid this being found out, they'll do anything to convince you otherwise (but only [[OTI]], where nobody has to move, conveniently enough.)

One of the only ways to extract any form of [[lulz]] (and even then, a weak draught) from these [[fat| chubby fucks]] and [[American| hambeasts]] is to find their hidey-holes and accuse them of being bothered. Although seemingly unfunny at first, being bothered is the only sin in the discordian sham. Accusing them of being bothered leads to protests, which you can interpret as being bothered. Then you keep shouting that they're bothered, and hopefully they'll [[An Hero| kill themselves]] or something retarded like that.
