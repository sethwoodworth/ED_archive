'''oic''', short for "Oh, I see", is the best way to blow off someone IMing [[you]] that you just don't give a shit about.

==Examples==
<div id="example1" style="height:60px; width:500px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black;">
<prima> hey secunda, we're just throwing a fucking bomb ass party, there's about 200 people here and booze is free<br />
<secunda> oic
</div><br />
<div id="example2" style="height:60px; width:500px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black;">
<prima> I do not know how to twll you this bro, but I fucked your little sister last night. In your bed.<br />
<secunda> oic. don't call me 'bro'
</div><br />
<div id="example3" style="height:50px; width:500px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black;">
<ptime> your car is alright, but [[ricer|not as fast as my Honda Civic]]<br />
<secunda> oic
</div><br />
