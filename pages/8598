'''TwiztidAsh''' (aka Stephanie Holly) is a morbidly [[obese]], [[manchild|32 year old]] [[juggalette]] (apparently it ''is'' actually a chick) from [[College|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]] who is, as of yet, a largely untapped source of [[lulz|juggalulz]] on our internets.  TwiztidAsh is an anti-[[cyber bully]]ing activist and, ironically, also an [[Internet Tough Guy|Internet tough guy]]. In between drinking Daddy's moonshine and scaring kids away from her/his/its [[Redneck|trailer]] with her/his/its car jack, he/she/it's also a huge [[WoW]] nerd.  In fact, he/she/it takes it so [[seriously]] that he/she/it made the following video, which shortly went [[viral]] (original removed), out of massive butthurt due to being [[b&|booted]] from his/her/whateverthefuck's WoW [[guild]]...

==TwiztidAsh's cheating juggalo e-boyfriend==
[[File:DevonMatayaMatchDotCom.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Looking for more whales to [[Harpoons|harpoon]].]]
TwiztidAsh's Alaskan boyfriend "Devon Mataya" aka [http://www.youtube.com/user/BoxerLife5150 BoxerLife5150] is still single and active in the [[Online Dating|dating scene]]. No surprise being as he lives in [[Alaska]] and TwiztidAsh lives in [[West Virginia]]. Despite calling Devon Mataya her future husband on her [http://syntheticashe.livejournal.com/profile livejournal profile], already taking his last name on her [http://www.myspace.com/syntheticashe myspace profile], and them both confessing their MMFWCL for each other by way of video on YouTube, [[Fact|Devon Mataya is still single]].

According to Devon, Twiztidash came into his life as a online shoulder to cry on after his [[My mom just died|mother died]] and he went [[batshit|off his medication]]. Devon says as soon as he gets the money to get the fuck out of Alaska and Twiztidash somehow gets the money to get the fuck out of West Virginia, they are gonna [[TwiztidAsh#Ahab nets a whale |meet up IRL]] and settle down in another trailer park somewhere.  [[Lol]].

===e-boyfriends an Internet Tough Guy===
Devon claims to be a professionally trained boxer but never once presented a shred of evidence to back it up.
<br>
Like a true [[Internet Tough Guy]] Devon challenges people to come to [[Alaska]] and fight him, but of course this never happens. Devon is such a [[Eunich|nutless coward]] that he post false addresses claiming they are his home and asking people to come fight him.

===e-boyfriend hates woman and children===
[[File:BoxerLife5150pussy.JPG|thumb|[[sick fuck|baby killer]]]]
Devon is hated by almost all the YouTube's [[juggalo]]s because of his ongoing vicious attacks on [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Juggalo#Juggalettes Juggalettes] and their children. Perhaps Devon hates all woman, which would explain why he has chosen to [[Online Dating|e-date]] that fat little man TwiztidAsh.

{{quote|maybe I should throw Damion into a pack of your favorite type of dog, pitbulls. How fun it would be watching him get ripped and torn to pieces, lol!|Devon R Mataya|}}

===e-boyfriends a pedophile===
According to YouTube's [[Juggalo]] gang and a few others users Devon has made a number of sexual advances on [[13_year_old_girl|underage girls]].
<br>
Below is a video made by a [[juggalo]] hating [[punk]] rocker who had a [[Flame Wars|online dispute]] with Devon.

==Number dropped==
Nov 01, 2010 TwiztidAsh had it's dox dropped by some of it's juggalo friends so it set it's YouTube channel to private.
<br>
Credit for the doxing is being taken by what appears to be TwiztidAsh's identical twin [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU56xVqmo6s sauce]

== Ahab nets a whale ==
[[Image:thegrosscouple.png|thumb|Farmer John called, he wants his pigs back.]]
On November 17, 2010, Twiztidash uploaded a pair of videos showcasing her [[facepalm|irl visit]] to Alaska to see her [[truth|equally obese and disgusting]] Captain Ahab Boxerlife5150. Sea World trainers were unavailable for comment.

== Out of the trailor and onto the street ==
[[Image:Boxerlife5150.JPG|thumb|Financial future.]]
On January 22, 2011, the [[Domestic_violence|happy couple]] living in TwiztidAsh's grandmothers [[truth|trailer]] planned on winning a "tough man" contest featuring Boxerlife and Twiztidash as contenders. Boxerlife's chance to actually [[Internet_tough_guy|fight someone]] was dashed when the bottom of Ash's  clown car rusted out.

==Jan 31st Pizza Raid==
When a bunch of [[b/tards|stoners on /b/]] placed orders for gratuitous amounts of pizza from her docs above, some [[newfag]] who lived nearby and had heard word of the lulz decided to go film it.  What follows is the shittiest video of pizza being delivered known to man.
