Latvia
[[Image:happy_urla5.jpg|thumb|This is a picture of Russians looting in [[Eastern Europe|Estonia]], lol wut]]
'''Latvians''', like citizens of many tiny ex-[[Soviet Russia|Soviet]] nations ([[Lithuania]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]) lack a cultural identity, and make up for this by claiming to have invented absolutely everything under the sun, including the [[television]], [[alcohol]], [[fire]], and [[AIDS]]. The fact is, Latvians did NOT invent the [[television]], [[alcohol]], or [[fire]]. Sorry. They did, however, launch a distributed denial of service attack against [[Idlenet]]; thusly all botnets that are complete failures are referred to as Latvian botnets.

The primary export of Latvia is the fat suctioned from the gigantic ass of [[Areems]] and Gedroics, which is rendered and made into soap by more intelligent nations.

One of the more unique customs of Latvia is the Feast of Count Blacula, a local holiday during which Latvians cremate a goat and hurl the ashes at the "[[Jameth|cretinous Jew]]".

Latvia's current president is Valdis Zatlers aka Doctor Doom, who rules the country with an iron fist. He would like to remind you that "Latvia is [[serious business]], ya."

==History of Latvia==

Since the beginning of time, Latvia has been [[serious business]]. They were once a great power, the rulers of the Baltics, until [[Last Thursday]], when [[over 9000]] minions of [[Tacgnol]] came to bother [[Longcat]], who was slumbering under the Baltic Sea. [[Longcat]] was all "Tacgnol doesn't know about my powers" and kicked his ass so that he could go back to sleep. All this happened on Latvia. It was like two [[fatass|sumo wrestlers]] [[fighting]] on a dime. Latvia got pwned, but then went back to looking at [[rule 34|Pok√©rotica]] out of [[Penthouse]].

After this tragedy, they claim to have founded the [[Silver Circle]]. They also claim to have invented Politcasm and ground meats, the only things they actually did do, but, as always, they did it wrong.

The national sport of Latvia is Wayfinder, as it has been ever since [[last Thursday]].

==Latvia Today==

Latvia suffers an infestation of its [[Russia|Russian]] enemies, after they realized how [[Shit|shitty]] Russia was and snuck into the nearest [[Pool|country]] to give [[AIDS]].

Most Latvians are [[Satanist]], because after they got [[Rape|raped]] by [[Leftard|Stalin]] [[last Thursday]], they're still [[butthurt]]. The others just don't give a [[shit]].

[[Nobody|Everyone]] in Latvia watches Television. One Latvian TV station, Howiereportinglive, won the THRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLS from Scotty Vanity. Latvia is also unfortunate enough to have [[MTV]] Latvija, which continuously broadcasts shitty [[emo]] [[wigger]] music and [[unfunny|reality shows]]. UPDATE: The economy is so bad that they don't even have that any more.

==National Anthem of Latvia==

Now this is a story all about how my

Country got flipped turned upside down

And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there

I'll tell you how I become a boring country called Latvia.


In the west Soviet Union born and raised

On the Baltics is where I spent most of my days

Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool

And all shootin' some [[homosexuals]] outside of the school

When a couple of [[Russia|Commies]] that were up to no good

Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood

I got in one little fight and the Saeima got scared

And said, "You're leaving the Soviet Union and changing your name back to Latvia"


I whistled for a flag and when it came near

The plating was burgundy and white and it had a 2:1 ratio

If anything I could say that this flag was rare

But I thought, "Nah, forget it. Yo home to Bel-Air!"

I pulled up some shit around 2004

And I yelled to NATO "Hey, lemme join!"

Looked at the EU I was finally there

To sit on my ass as the boring country of Latvia

EPIC!!! FUCKING SHIT THEY DIDNT WIN! 

HA HA, THE RUSSIANS KICKED THEIR ASSES. (Recent [[conspiracy|research]] suggests NINJA INVOLVEMENT!)

==Latvians==

Latvians are strange folk. Made of 2 parts [[Cavemen|Latgall]], 1 part [[Russian]] and another part Jew, the greatest aspirations they have in life is to become [[an hero|an folk hero]], the ballad of their [[faggotry|deeds]] being spread across the land.

What makes Latvia slightly less fail is the lack of [[black people]]. Roughly there's about 20 of them. Only niggers have made a club which is now about 2 years old ([[srsly]]). Any nigger who dares wander the dark corners of Latvia gets instant punch to the face by citizens. Any actual nigger children get beat up at schools etc.	 

Every year faggots and lesbos do their pride parade faggotry festival festivity or shit. Most of the time it get's [[lulz|lulzy]]. The only people who go watch these ass parades are only those who are there to bash the ever loving shit out of homos. Usually it ends with people shouting at fags and throwing (human) [[shit]] at them both figuratively and literally, because unlike Russia, they can't get their gay asses pwned by everyone, like they can in Russia. Makes you wonder why the fuck these ass-pirates even make such festivals. 	 
	 
To put it simply if you are a nigger it's tough shit for you. If you are gay it's even tougher shit for you. Gay niggers are natural enemies of Latvians so you can make the job easier for them by becoming [[an hero]].


===Children===

Latvian children are [[retarded|immoral]] [[killdozer|monsters]] that [[rape|vandalize]] everything they see. Most of Latvian children dream of becoming [[an hero|an folk hero]] since they become like 4 years old. Every third Latvian child is [[Jew|Jewish]] or [[Russian]]

===[[Women]]===

There are no [[women]] in Latvia (except Mikhail Zadornov). There are only men dressed as women, because the [[Russia|Ruskys]] went in and took their [[women]] back from Latvia after they ran away from home. The closest thing they have is prostitutes. You can find many cheap prostitutes and brides in Latvia.
