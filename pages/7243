'''SarahChihuahua''' is a [[Attention whore|hard to miss]] [[Furry|toonophile]] who makes her home on about [[Attention whore|nine different accounts]] on DeviantART, each one filled to the brim with what could be considered crimes against humanity, or at least crimes against most people's childhoods. Every single one of her accounts exists solely to satisfy her various debauched [[Furry|toonophilic]] Mary-Sue needs, her [[Porn|interests]] varying anywhere from the Angry Beavers to [[DBZ]] to [[Invader Zim]] to Chowder and most horrifyingly of all Ren & Stimpy. Despite the fact that their [[homosexuality]] was played for laughs in the cartoon and Ren was obviously the dirty abusive [[Mexican]] in the equation, Sarah is convinced that these two have a LOVE SO PURE IT IS UNFATHOMABLE TO US DIRTY HEATHENS. 

The most amazing thing about Sarah is that she has all the time in the world to draw all of this horrible [[shit]], meaning she's likely a [[job]]less, [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] [[dying alone|perma-virgin]]. 

==Faggotry==
[[Image:Ren_and_stimpy_lovings.png|right|thumb|"Ren and Stimpy doing what lovers do.^^ "]]
Little of Sarah's work consists of [[heterosexual]] content, as she's just too big a fan of [[gay|dick-in-butt]] action involving cherished cartoon icons. Interestingly enough, even her completely [[original character|original]] female Mary-Sues Rena and Stimpa (Ren and Stimpy's sisters[!?]) are lesbian lovers, but all this [[faggotry]] aside, Sarah attempts to claim she is completely [[lie|straight]].

All of her porn is wisely located on [[FurAffinity|FA]], the [[gay]] [[furry]] asshole of the internet, where it belongs. There at her humble page you can wander into a whole new world of [[dongs]] and pain, her art will [[Rule 34|rape your childhood]] with [[bukkake|copious amounts]] of semen, [[Yiff|buttsecks]], and the kind of badly drawn [[Cock|penises]] only furfags can enjoy.

==Originality==
[[Image:Sarahchihuahuaissorry.jpg|thumb|left|SarahChihuahua apologizes for her [[shit]]ty art]]
Her only two vaguely [[Shit|original characters]] are two chihuahuas that she mainly renders in an extremely poor attempt at the self-important, whiny one-hit-wonder [[John Kricfalusi]]'s style. They're lovingly, and [[stupid|cleverly]] named Rem and Remmy. Both of these characters seem to have [[mary sue|some characteristics]] of Ren & Stimpy, and are even drawn in poses similar to official art of said characters. In an unexpected turn of events their favorite activity is being [[gay]] beyond [[gay]] and eating out each others [[Goatse|worn, loose assholes]].

But it doesn't end there, more of Sarah's deliciously [[fail]] attempts at originality can be found in her many other galleries. Every single female character she draws is a blatantly obvious self-insert as most of them include "Sarah" somewhere in their name. But at least it's slightly more creative than drawing a purple and pink female version of [[DBZ|Cell]] and naming it "Cella". 

Sarah also suffers some [[Unwarranted_self_importance|unwarranted self importance]] and believes everyone cares about her and her art. Every time she decides to quit a [[fandom]] forever she makes it sound like a tragedy that everyone involved mourns over. It's also notable that she doesn't take jokes very well and once, a long time ago on the interbutts, bawleeted everything and [[Waaaambulance|made a journal]] crying that [[truth|everyone hates her art]].

{{squote|Wow! That is wrong and I'm sorry this happened. Sorry to sound like this guy but it's really ronchy(If spelled right). It's great art work but very disturbing. Sorry, Hope this guy gets hit by a bus! Please don't fell bad but that is my opinion. I really do love your work and please don't be mad at me for saying that.|Snafuangel, [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/17478489/684804271 is very confused and thinks ED is ronchy]}}

{{squote|I am already well aware of this site: "ED" as it is commonly called is a site used nothing more then for internet harassment, which is against the law. This site is already the subject of several harassment lawsuits as we speak, but none-of-the-less, you should go on with your own, as this will put the site under even more pressure then it already is under.|Snipermander, [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/17478489/684868457 attorney at e-law]}}
