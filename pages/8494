[[Masturbation]] fodder for the adolescent.  The show quickly became [[Rule 34]]ed after it's premiere.

Not to mention, they are the worst spies ever. Always getting caught. ''Charlie's Angels'' > ''Totally Spies''.

I need a tissue after all that [[rape]] [[subtext]].

==Plot==
A secret spy organization named POOP is run by a [[panties|knickers]]-stealing old [[Britain|Limey]] who allocates important missions to a trio of [[girls|airheaded teenage cunts]] who can't even go into the field unless all of their gear looks girly and matches their outfits.  Once actually in the field, they could be counted on to [[cock]] everything up and get captured by whatever downs-addled wanker they were trying to stop from using hair spray to take over the world.  Cut to five minutes of the girls tied up while fully clothed so the target audience can [[masturbate]] and cry.

==Cast==
===These three girls===
Their names might not all start with the same letter, but that's not really important. What is important is that they were all incredibly shallow characters stuffed to the gills with not just every anime cliche out there, but also every non-anime cliche there was room for. Basically, someone took the Powerpuff Girls, gave them realistic enough bodies, and replaced the tomboyish dyke with a spoiled bitch. Also, they made Bubbles a black person.

===The BritFag Boss===
He's your [[typical|average, everyday]] [[Britfag]] [[pedophile]] with a bunch of technological crap (British as in voiced by an [[Americunt]] who can't do a British accent for shit), and he was an [[Pop Idol]] judge reject. Everyone, even the spies themselves, admit that he's [[fail|"so lame!"]] and a [[pedo]].

===The Bully===
A [[typical]] girl bully who's basically the equavialent of [[Gary Oak]]. Fucking ugly bitch. She's a Jew alright.

==Criticisms==
A lot of people have claimed the animation is just a bad ripoff of anime. But there's a difference... [[Lie|The animation is better then anime because it features human beings that actually ''look'' like human beings.]] [[Anonymous|Anon]] has also discovered that ''Totally Spies'', despite popular belief, [[lie|does not cater to a certain irregular fetish per episode]]. The writers of ''Totally Spies'' just pick subjects that happen to do with fetishes.

The show is also constantly mistaken as being an American show, when it's actually from [[antisemitic]] [[socialist]] [[France]].

The most common complaint about this show is that it is essentially [[masturbate|masturbation]] fodder for people who are afraid of [[porn|nudity]].  Every fetish imaginable makes a glorious appearance in this show, so long as that fetish does not require nudity.  From [[vore]] to [[furry]] to [[baby|age play]] to feet, everything someone could masturbate to that the censors wouldn't notice saddled onto this show and took it for a wild ride.  And the bondage.  Oh, the bondage!  If ever you've wanted to see a fully-clothed teenager tied up and soaked in their own failure, then this is the show for you.

Or, rather, was the show for you.  Thankfully, the show has been mercifully canceled, and is already well into its journey towards obscurity.

== Spyes liek temz ==
Like any fanfare of media, Totally Spies fans have no lifes. The fans argue over some shit about the cartoon. They are SRSLY SRSS on information and fankruft. Get a wood hardon at drawn preteen girls is so fckd up, get a life.

What race is [[Immigrant|Alex]] Polizzi anyway? She looks like a [[Gypsy]] more than anything. Oh fuck that, she can be [[Irish]] like her butt-buddies Sam Milano (a redhead) and Clover Spears (her name). You fans still can't get over the show, like [[Nerd|Sam]] and [[Bully|Mandy]] Kardashian are [[lesbian|lovers]], her crony [[redneck|Mindy]] Aguilera is a "[[incest|kissing]]" [[redneck|cousin]] and [[Bitch|Clover]] is a fake blonde. [[Slut|Britney]] Tilly isn't on more than 3 episodes, but many of the fans are in love with her. [[Rape|Violet]] Lohan is HAWT villain. You want to fcks her. 

Sheesh, Totally Spies is soooooo 2001.
