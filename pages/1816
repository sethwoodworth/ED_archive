'''CRAB NICHOLSON:EXTREME SLEEPOVER''' is a fictional [[video game]] for [[DS]] that was first heard of in /v/ around the summer of 2008.

It all started with a picture of Jack Nicholson's head Photoshopped onto the body of a crab. Shortly after being posted, many [[no life|/v/irgins]] decided to post possible dialogue for the game. The pic apparently originates from a Mad Magazine, which I seem to have fucking lost. 

==The game's plot==

The game focuses on [[You|a person]], who comes home after [[Buttsecks|having a hard day of work]]. You can explore the bedroom. Just when you are going to sleep, Crab Nicholson pops up saying “ARE YOU READY FOR THAT SLEEPOVER [[NIGGER]]? FUCK YEAH YOU ARE!” [[Kidnapping|He drags you away to his house]], where you can enter his [[basement|ultimate lair of awesomeness]], and explore parts of his house. The rest of the game is still under development.

The game became quickly popular on 4chan and soon, some [[Script kiddies|teams]] actually started developing the game for PC [[buttsex|but found better things to do]]. The original command lines from the team can be found [http://crabnicholson.blogspot.com here].
