'''Geoffrey Quentin McCaully Hubbard'''(6 January 1954 â€“ 12 November 1976), was the [[faggot]] son of [[L. Ron Hubbard]], critically acclaimed writer, and founder of the famous and [[lulzy]] [[idiot]] trap, The <s>Church of</s> Cult [[Scientology]]. Quentin (or Queenu as he was known to his friends) had been prepared by his father to take over the organization, although Quentin wanted more to take it in the ass. Quentin was discovered by police October 28, 1976, unconscious from an apparent suicide attempt; he died two weeks later.

His existence was a prime source of stress for LRH, and his "suicide" is an excellent object in which to troll those scientologists who manage to break free of their web filtering software onto the actual internets.

Geoffrey Quentin McCaully Hubbard was born on January 6, 1954 as the son of L. Ron Hubbard and Mary Sue Hubbard (convicted of Conspiracy against the United States Government and locked up). Growing up, Queenu told friends he wanted to be a pilot, however his father insisted he dedicate himself to the church and rise through its hierarchy.

Sources close to him have asserted that his [[homosexuality]] caused him a great deal of [[irony|butthurt]] due to his father correctly categorizing [[faggotry]] as an illness or sexual perversion. This is one of the many assertions made by the godly LRH and the irrefutable Dianetics that is entirely factual.

LRH would often have Quentin severely punished for his gay activities. This was reportedly Quentin's favorite part of being a Scientologist.

Quentin's severe depression led to a failed [[suicide]] attempt in 1974. In 1976, he disappeared from his home in Clearwater, Florida and he was later found in a car in Las Vegas. According to police, Quentin had run a hose from his tailpipe to his window and was later found to have semen in his rectum. When asked for comment, a representative from the LVPD had this to say: "Rectum... damn near killed 'em."

== How Quentin's Suicide Impacted CoS ==

L. Ron's reaction upon hearing of his son's death was, "That stupid fucking kid! That stupid fucking kid! Look what he's done to me! [[lol]]"  He then turned his attention back to his lunch which consisted of rum and amphetamines.

Mary Sue Hubbard cried like a [[whore]].

Former Scientologist Kima Douglas said, "The death report said there was sperm in the anal canal and he had died of asphyxiation of carbon monoxide, I always thought he was homosexual."

[[Xenu]], not normally known for his sense of humor said; "Anyone who knew the kid had to figure he would die with a hose in his tailpipe."

== Quentin's Impact On the World ==
