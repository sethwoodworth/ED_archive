Fourth wall
[[Image:FirstWall.jpg|thumb|In theatre, walls are broken in reverse numerical order. This is an example of breaking the fourth, third, second and first walls.]]


'''The fourth wall''' is an idea from the magical world of [[theatre]]. As such, the idea itself-like all ideas-is gay. In theatre, the stage will be set up to resemble a room with three walls with the fourth wall taken out. This non-existent fourth wall is our magical portal through which we view the lives of [[Shit nobody cares about|our beautifully dressed characters with perfect hair and make-up who always say exactly the right thing]].

==What is a Fourth Wall?==

The Fourth Wall is the imaginary divider between audience and set/cast. In a production piece, it should feel as if you are viewing the actions as they occur, not being told about them; or narrated to.

In the cases of [[basement dwelling]], computer-addicted individuals, "the fourth wall" would make a great epithet for the wall opposite the wall the computer is against. This has never caught on.

In reality TV, the fourth wall has taken a new meaning. In most of these shows, it relates to interaction between the cast and crew.

* On the [[crap|Real World]], the fourth wall was broken by a slut of a cast-member and an ugly, mulleted producer.
* Paula Abdul doing lines of coke off contestants in ''[[American Idol]]''.
* Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth savagely devouring the souls of three cameramen on ''[[crap|The Apprentice]]''.
* Dan blowing the producers repeatedly for more chances at appearing on ''[[crap|Real World/Road Rules Challenge]]'' and all its incarnations, even though he clearly sucks.
* Deadpool, semi-lulzy Marvel [[Comic|Comics]] character. Exclude She-Hulk because she's a whore.

==Why you shouldn't do it, fag==


Breaking the fourth wall simply ruins any sense of drama, reality or acting in a show. No one will be able to suspend their disbelief ever again, after a fourth wall is broken. This means that your comic, TV show, or movie, will now SUCK because even retarded [[13-year-old boys]] will be able to tell it's fake. There goes the fan base!
