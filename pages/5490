'''Morons''', or members of [[tl;dr|"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints"]], are members of a "church" invented by Joseph Smith, a horny conman and Freemason, in 1830.  Smith decided that traditional Christianity wasn't fucking stupid enough, so he set out to create the most [[retard]]ed religion in mankind's history, which surpasses even scientology in terms of absurdity. The early [[Lies|"Church"]] grew through [[Bullshit|charismatic public speeches]] and fervent missionary work which eventually came to promote polygamy (and [[pedophiles|pedophilia]] as a byproduct) as the recruitment drive grew more ferociously fucked up. In a brilliant employment of [[Trolling|trolling]] for his own [[Profit|gain]], Joseph realized that the hate brewing against his church would serve to bolster the believers' [[Fursecution|persecution]] complex, and [[fursecution|feeling persecuted]] means that you never have to see [[Reality|the truth]].

The result is that wherever they are, Mormons have a higher rate of [[raep|sex crimes, adultery]], and [[teen]] [[suicide]] than the national average. The only clear answer is that Joseph Smith was doing it for the lulz (and to fuck his cousin).

{{quote2|Joseph Smith was a ruh-tard.|Alan from The Hangover}} 

==Theology==
#Invent crazy story about golden tablets, magic specs, lost tribes, visions of God, etc.
#Convince gullible hicks, thieves and whores that your story is true.
#As [[cult]] leader, use story as a pretext to fuck all the nubile, virginal teenage girls you want.
#Get killed by angry mob.
#Resurrection time!
#Repeat steps 3 through 5.
#?????
#PROFIT!

==Beliefs==
[[Image:Special-mormon-underware.jpg|thumb|Mormon undies (a.k.a. Magic Underwear)]]
Mormons like to hint that they might be [[Christians]] but have major differences in what they believe. Some are more subtle than others, like the ones about [[African-American|blackies]].

Mormons believe a Tribe of [[Jews]] sailed to the Americas hundreds of years before [[Christ]]. Some of these Jews turned into [[Mexicans]] for being assholes. After a whole bunch of [[TL;DR]], Christ uses [[Raelian|celestial]] technology to travel from the [[Middle east]] to South America, where he teaches the Mexican Jews. Then all the Mexican Jews kill each other except for some guy named [[Moron|Moroni]], who walked to upstate New York, to bury the spiritual history of his people for Joseph Smith to find. 

Other Mormon beliefs include:

*'''Baptism for the Dead''', so you can still baptize that stubborn father of yours. Mormons trolled Jews worldwide by baptizing [[holocaust]] victims without consent from their families.
*'''Mandatory Temple work'''. One of the rituals is called <i>[[Cock|Endowment]]</i>, and that is where they get those fantastic underpants.
*'''The Word of Wisdom'''. This is where the no [[coffee]], [[alcohol]], or tobacco comes from.
*'''The Second Coming''' will touch down in the place this whole mess began, the Garden of Eden, in Jackson County Missouri ([[srsly]]).
*'''Temple Recommends''' are necessary to get into Mormon temples and they can only be obtained by wedding a young woman thrice then impregnating her mother AND sister.
*'''The children of Adam and Eve needed incest to propagate the species''' ([[srsly]]).
*'''[[Batshit|Doctrine of Eternal Progression]]''', the reward for a race well run:
:For the price of your earthly life, you too can become the winnar of an eternal vacation to your very! own! '''PLANET!''' 
:Find a hawt goddess bitch, [[Josef_Fritzl|lock her away, raep her until her eyes bleed]],   
:and watch her spit out billions of spirit-children, all ready to fight to the death for another chunk of rock! 
:(For a limited time.  Not valid with any other offer.  Offer not valid in Hawaii, the [[Chris-Chan|Virgin]] Islands, or anywhere outside the Milky-Way Galaxy.)   

In addition to the King James Version of the Bible, Mormons reckon three other books holy writ: the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. The Book of Mormon contains the aforementioned tale of the Mexican Jews (or Mews) . The D&C contains "revelations" proclaimed by Joseph Smith and other church leaders; i.e., the shit they made up as they went along. The Pearl of Great Price is the least [[tl;dr]] of the three and by far the most [[batshit insane]]&mdash;allegedly [[Bullshit|translated from a set of ancient Egyptian documents]], it discusses, among other things, how God lives on a big-ass distant planet called Kolob.  What they won't tell you is that The Book of Mormon has undergone [[over 9000|over 4000]] edits since the original 1830 edition (not bad for the "most perfect book ever written!").

==History==
After several failed scams, Joseph Smith struck a home run. Deciding that people [[Cult|believed him enough]] that he could start fucking with their sex lives, Joseph successfully renewed the [[Christian]] tradition of polygamy. Jealous of all the hot Mormon sex going on, and in fear of losing their own women to the orgy, hicks began shooting Mormons in retaliation for Mormon's shooting them while trying to claim the holy land of Missouri, and the Mormons got [[b&|kicked out]]. Joseph was eventually killed, and the wagon trains fled to Utah, where they [http://www.religioustolerance.org/lds_mass.htm/ murdered travelers], blamed Indians, and were stuck with Mexicans. Those Indians became white people if they converted and married enough wives but lost the status when they [[died]] (see below). [[Srsly]]. 

Connor, head of the California Volunteers and bitter about leading a massacre of American Indians on their behalf, accurately characterized the Morons of the 1850s as "traitors, murderers, fanatics and [[whore]]s." 

===American [[Islam]]===
In many ways, Moronism is the closest thing the [[USA]] has to a home-grown [[Islam]]: both [[crazy|srsly stranger]] offshoots of [[Christian]]ity, they spread their beliefs by fightin' round the world during the life of the main [[prophet|profit]]. Both prophets were heavily into [[loli]]. Both used promises of [[loli]], polygamy, and [[win]]ning at [[violence]] to recruit [[low-life|low-lives]]. Both claimed better [[telephone|direct lines of conversation]] with [[God]] and more [[LOL]]able miracles than [[Raptor Jesus|Chrestos]] ever had. Both have holy books with slabs copied from [[Canon|the Bible]] (directly in the Book of Moron and strange [[shoop|mashup]]s in the other one). Both [[love]]d [[cash|lucre]], and relied on getting it from [[women]] at crucial times. 

They also share big splits over stuff connected to the second [[prophet|profit]]. Both are designed to guarantee pilgrimage and [[money]] for particular cities in the desert. A key difference: the Morons had to build [[Las Vegas|Salt Lake City]] to draw the [[fucktard|rube]]s but Mohammad only had to promise to keep up Mecca's popularity with [[religious]] [[tourist]]s to [[pwn|get given]] the place.

==Mormon Universities==
There are several Mormon-chartered universities, the best-known of which is undoubtedly Brigham Young University, [[Image:Kami.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Typical BYUer]]. Along with mandatory courses on [http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/changech5c.htm reformed Egyptian], [http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/daily/prayer/seer_stones_eom.htm/view.jsp?artid=52&letter=U Urim and Thummim], and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKN_yjoDTCY# One Bad Apple], [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=272726365278093713 funky disco dancing] is widely practiced by the many cute, round-faced teens with great hair who attend.

==Modern Mormon Culture==
[[Image:Misconceptions.jpg|thumb|Missionaries are fucking EVERYWHERE]]
[[Image:Italjet-moron.jpg|thumb|The legendary Italjet Moron]]
In the 1830’s, when men's pants were first tailored with buttons visible down the front of the fly, the Mormon leader Brigham Young discouraged the population from wearing them, calling them “[[sex|fornication]] pants.” To this day, Mormons still hate button-fly jeans. Mormons refer to each other as "Brother" or "Sister", which is why [[black people]] stay the hell away. The second to last thing [[black people]] want to be called by a [[white people|cracker]] is "Brotha". Mormon social life centers on the [[Shit nobody cares about|church and family]]. Men have priestly [[Buttsecks|responsibilities]] in and out of the home. Women attend relief society which sounds like whoring but is basically church-sanctioned gossip hour. Women also participate in home visiting to collect gossip. College age students attend "singles ward", which helps keep those with inquiring minds from making normal friends. This keeps Mormon behavior stable from about 14 until 30 or marriage, whichever comes first. Youth activities include:
*[[Frottage]] during NCMO (non-committal make out).  
*Watching lame Mormon movies because anything above a PG-13 rating is an [[2girls1cup|abomination]].
*STILL quoting Napoleon Dynamite. Wait, they still do that ...? What a bunch of frickin' IIIDiots ... wait, [[YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG|fuck]]!
*[[loli|Mormon girls]] spend all their parents Mexican Jew cash on make up and [http://www.kutv.com/mostpopular/story.aspx?content_id=e3f7e03a-1b28-4441-a76a-bb8c3b9c8802/ plastic surgery].

==Criticism==
===The Hot Spicy Racism===

From day one this so-called "true church" ([[lie|as proclaimed by the members]]) prohibited [[nigras]] from holding the priesthood.  This policy wasn't repealed until 1978 [[over_9000|over nine thousand years]] after the church was established.  Predictably no-one noticed because [[nigra|black people]] don't get involved in anything that would infringe on the time that could be more gainfully employed stealing televisions and car stereos. [[African-American|Nigrah]] Morons also had to attend segregated services.  

This [[smart|sensible]] idea had a bizarre flipside: [[Native Americans|American Indians]] were allowed to attend the same services as [[White People|Whitey]], but were supposed to be segregated in the [[Heaven|afterlife]]. They probably had a little trouble attracting Indian members after [http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/history_matters/031702.html one of their guys led one of the biggest massacres of Indians in the west] and they [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1386232/Mormon-leader-'ordered-massacre-of-settlers'.html framed Indians for their own massacre of crackers].

Nigrahs apparently got to reach the same afterlife as Whitey, just to give them a chance to keep up the [[IRL]] [[troll]]ing even after [[death|the end of IRL]].

If you look hard enough and dedicate enough time, you can find the only black mormon.  No one knows the exact gender of it and it is extremely good at disguises making it seem like more might exist. [[Image:Black_mormons.jpg|thumb|He can be seen here, caught off guard but already blending in.]]  

If the [[lie]] "the Mormon church is the true church" is to be believed one must also deduce that God is more racist than the lowest of the low on ED. Actually, I think God is the most racist motherfucker I've ever met. IT MUST BE TRUE!

===Polygamy===
Before 1890 the Mormons practiced polygamy, providing a way for men to engage in dirty sex with multiple women simultaneously and still play the upstanding guy. 

It's a little known fact that Joseph Smith had 23 wives, who ranged in age from 14 to 60. Eleven were under 20. Most were done after he died (YA RLY).

The second prophet of the Mormon church Brigham Young was known for his large family that consisted of 18 wives and 57 children.

Some offshoots of the Mormon church who declare themselves "fundamentalist Mormons" still condone polygamy (the ones that don't just do it in secret) and are still [[paedophile|banging minors]] today. Tell this to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_scotsman REAL] Mormon and they'll <s>kick you in the balls</s> be an [[Internet Tough Guy]].

===The Moar You Know===
MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that Jesus' death on the cross only partially saves the believer.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that that according to Anton Lavey's Satanic Bible, the demon god of the living dead is called "Mormo". Is it just a coincidence that the Mormons are so concerned with the dead?

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that on their Salt Lake City Temple they prominently display an upside-down star which is a Satanic symbol known as the Goat's head. Why?

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that they believe your Church is wrong, your Christian creeds are abomination to God, and you pastor or Priest is a hireling of Satan.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that there is salvation only in their church - all others are wrong.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that those who have been through their temples are wearing secret underwear to protect themselves from "evil". This "evil" includes non - Mormons like you.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU about their secret temple rites at all. If they did, you would spot them as non Christians immediately.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that they think "familiar spirits" are good, and that their Book of Mormon has a "familiar spirit". Leviticus 19:31 says familiar spirits defile one, and are to be avoided at all costs.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that women receive salvation only through their Mormon husbands, and must remain pregnant for all eternity.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that the Virgin Mary really wasn't a virgin at all but had sex relations with their heavenly father to produce the Mormon version of Jesus Christ

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that they believe Jesus had at least three wives and children while he was on this earth.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that the "heavenly father" they ask you to pray to with them, is really an exalted man that lives on a planet near the star base Kolob, and is not the Heavenly Father of the Bible at all.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that Jesus was really Lucifer's brother in the spirit world, and it was only due to a "heavenly council" vote that Jesus became our redeemer instead of Satan!!

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that there are over one hundred divisions in Mormonism. They conveniently "forget" this while criticizing the many denominations within the body of Christ

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that all their so- called scriptures such as the Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price, Doctrine and Covenants, and even their official "Mormon Doctrine" statements contradict each other on MAJOR doctrinal points. The King James Bible is likewise contradicted.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that the reason the Book of Mormon has no maps is because there is not one scrap of archaeological evidence to support it!

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that the state of Utah, which is predominately Mormon, has a higher than the national average of wife-beating, child abuse, and teenage suicide.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that their prophet Joseph Smith was heavily involved in the occult when he founded Mormonism.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that that they encourage visitations from dead relatives from the "spirit world", a practice forbidden in the Bible. (Deuteronomy 18:10-12.)

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that there are many accounts of Joseph Smith's first vision besides the one they present to you, and all are different

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that their secret temple oaths are based on the Scottish Rite Masons.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that before 1978 they considered the Negro race inferior, and even one drop of Negro blood prevented a person from entering their priesthood.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that they expect Christ to return to their temple in Missouri, but they haven't built the temple He's supposed to return to, because they don't own the property. (It is owned by the "Temple Lot Mormons" who have plans of their own, and won't let the Salt Lake City group buy it).

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that they consider the Bible to be untrustworthy and full of errors.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that they believe the Archangel Michael came down to earth with several of his celestial wives, and became Adam in the garden of Eden.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that that they believe the angel Gabriel came down to earth and became Noah in the days of the flood.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that their Prophet Joseph Smith prophesied falsely many times. For example, he foretold the second coming of Christ for 1891. The Bible teaches that one false prophecy puts the prophet under death sentence. (Deuteronomy 18:20-22).

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that their Prophet Joseph Smith did not die as a martyr as they claim, but was killed during a gun battle in which he himself killed two men and wounded a third.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU about the Mountain Meadows Massacre in which they brutally murdered an innocent wagon train of settlers, of over one hundred men, women, and most of the children, traveling through Utah.

MORMONS WON'T TELL YOU that Joseph Smith taught that there were inhabitants on the moon, and Brigham Young taught there were inhabitants on the sun as well!

==Trolling Mormons IRL==
[[Image:Img orgazmo.jpg|thumb|Orgazmo is a training film for Mormon missionaries.]]

*Tell them that you thought the movie <i>Orgazmo</i> was accurate.

* Sneak [[drugs]] into snacks for missionaries. [http://www.mormonstoday.com/991010/D2Hashish01.shtml] 

* Go to your local Mormon church on the first [[Soviet Sunday|Sunday]] of the month, crash their [[Cult|Fast'N'Testimony Meetin']], take the mic, and speak passionately about the doctrine of [[Cthulhu|Cthulhu]], and how He is your [[Satan|personal savior]]. 

* Find the Mormon temple near you and go to the visitor's center. [[Slut|Flirt]] with the Mormon [[girl]] sent to convert you to Mormonism while your [[Girlfriend|girlfriend]] puts a BIOS password on their genealogy computer. [[Lulz]] are sure to ensue. 

* Convert to Mormonism, and get an assignment teaching Sunday School to [[Lolicon|lolis]]. Bring [[Pedobear|pedobear]] into your curriculum. [[Lulz|Lulz]] and the [[FBI|party van]] guaranteed! 

* Join the Mormon Church, tell the local [[Pervert|bishop]] that you never [[Masturbation|fap]] so you can get a [[Shit nobody cares about|Temple Recommend]] (the paper that says you're not a [[Masturbation|fapper]]), go to the Temple to do baptisms for teh [[An Hero|dead]], taek a [[Shit|shit]] in teh big hot tub they use to summon the [[Demon|dead]], and make them Mormons.

* Reconvert Mormons: Passionately tell Mormons you meet that it was the Elohim (an alien civilization) that met Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove. Tell them that the Elohim have selected a new prophet on Earth, named [[Raelian|Raël]]. Tell them you have scientific proof (glowing silver tablets). When in doubt, remember, Mormons are gullible by definition. This may result in missionaries leaving the mission.

* If you live in California, walk up to a Mormon and tell them you're gay, that you find Mormon underwear a turn-on and you hope that gay marriage is taught in schools.

* Ask them why they believe Jesus and Satan are brothers, watch them deny the whole thing, then point them to their own doctrine and let them know they're going to Hell for ignoring it:

==Trolling Mormons OL==

Actually, trolling mormons online is ridiculously easy. They even gave trolls a place for them to [[Troll|work]], called mormon.org. This site has a [http://www.mormon.org/chat/ chat] so that [[Retards|people interested in this religion]] could ask some [[Yahoo Answers|questions]] about this [[Crap|church]]. In actuality, it is the place where [[trolls]] gather to get their daily [[Drug|dose of lulz]]. The most common question is: "[[Win|Is it true that Mormons can have multiple wifes?]]" Sadly, [[no]], [[Lie|they can't]]. One easy way to troll them is to [[I accidentally X|accidentally]] spell their religion "Moron". [[Seriously]], people with such a name are [[asking for it]]. Here is an example of some trolling material:

:"Welcome to Mormon.org chat.
:A representative will be with you shortly.
:Agent [Ofa] is ready to assist you.
:Me: Hello.
:Ofa: hello Jacob
:Ofa: how are you?
:Me: I'm pretty good. How are you?
:Ofa: Im fine thank you.
:Ofa: How can I help you??
:Me: I have a few questions about the Mormon Church etc.
:Ofa: Okay I can answer them!
:Me: Alright. My last church had [[over 9000]] members. Does yours have [[over 9000]] member
:Ofa: Yes actually we do.
:Me: What?
:Me: Over 9000?
:Me: [[Seriously]]?
:Ofa: Yes, at the end of last year it was 13,824,854
:Me: [[Lulz|With a power level like that, you could probably one shot Vegeta.]]
:Me: I have another question though.
:Ofa: Okay
:Me: My friend told me, that if i Join the church i can get a free copy of your [[Shit|Bible thing?]]
:Ofa: You can actually get a copy of the Book of Mormon before you join the church.
:Me: Woah. That is very generous of you guys. [[LOL WUT|Now does this book come with a copy of Battletoads?]]
:Ofa: Im sorry I dont know what that is haha.
:Me: You mean you don't have battletoads :/
:Ofa: If you want a copy of the Book of Mormon we can have missionaries deliver them to your house
:Ofa: You may go to mormon.org and under the tab "Ask a Question" you can click on Have the missionaries contact me.. and you can get your free copy of the Book of Mormon through there
:Me: Ahhhh. Sweeet! Thank you! But i have one more question for you.
:Me: Then i'll be out of your hair!
:Ofa: haha okay
:Me: Alrighty.
:Me: [[Magnets]]...
:Me: [[ICP|HOW DO THEY WORK?]]
:Ofa: hmmm maybe you can google that one!
:Me: Can't God tell you, and then you can tell me?
:Me: Or is God not that strong):
:Me: I hope he is.
:Me: I need to believe he can answer that question for me.
:Me: That is the one thing i don't get about the world.
:Me: Im looking for a god to answer it for me.
:Ofa: God can answer other questions for you directly
:Ofa: pray about it
:Me: I have.
:Me: I've got down [[Blowjob|on my knees.]]
:Me: And prayed.
:Ofa: then you have to go out and look for the answer
:Me: God told me to come here.
:Me: And ask you.
:Ofa: sometimes we have to work first for the answer
:Ofa: so you can do research on who invented magnets
:Ofa: haha
:Me: Well, didn't god invent magnets?
:Me: Because...god created everything right?
:Me: Or am i wrong there?
:Ofa: There are man made things that man created by the elements that God created
:Ofa: Man got creative to create things that we can use today.
:Me: Well, i'm pretty sure a Magnet is a natural occurring thing. Man harnessed magnets to hold up our pictures on the fridge. But Magnets have been around since before the earth was created."

Of course, there are numerous threads on [[b|/b/]] calling for some massive trolling on the chat and posting results, and often many [[lulz]] ensue. However, surpsingly, missionaries evolve. It has been reported that they know very well the [[Bel-air]] song, due to the extensive number of [[btard|/b/tards]] using it for trolling purposes. Further attempts to use it will be therefore detected. Sometimes they're so [[emo|pissed off]] that [[Win|they close the chat for a while]].

As suggested by a previous editor, I went onto Mormon chat, and asked the guy about the whole Lucifer being god son deal. My original intention was to troll, but arguing is more fun. Here's what went down, it's a little boring to start with:

<div id="rjpost" style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black;">
Welcome to Mormon.org chat.<br>
A missionary will be with you shortly.<br>
Agent [Nate] is ready to assist you.<br>
Nate: How may I help you?<br>
Me: Hi nate.<br>
Me: I was just glossing over the book of mormon, as you do, and I was wondering something, and thought you might be able to help me<br>
Me: May I ask first, who is Father Elohim?<br>
Nate: May I ask what interests you in that question?<br>
Me: I just read a small paragraph that has his name, and I don't know who he actually is<br>
Nate: Was that in the Book of Mormon?<br>
Me: It was<br>
Nate: I see you are trolling us.<br>
Me: I'm seriously not<br>
Nate: That name never appears in the Book of Mormon<br>
Me: It does. I just read it, like, an hour ago<br>
Me: If I was trolling you, this would be a very pathetic attempt. I'd have just asked you how magnets work or something<br>
Me: I just Googled his name, and google tells me Father Elohim is go. Is that right?<br>
Me: is god* sorry, my D key sticks<br>
Nate: Could you show me the reference? But yeah, it's God the father<br>
Me: Okay. Well I was also just reading a quote from Spencer W. Kimball, who said Lucifer, who I believe is the devil, and Jehovah are his two sons. Is that right?<br>
Nate: Well, them and all of us are God's spirit children<br>
Nate: Before this life we lived with God<br>
Me: I don't recall living with him, but cool, might have to get regression to see if I can remember how awesome those times were.<br>
Me: Anyway, back to my point. If God created Lucifer, why would he have not stopped him before he went all evil and because his fathers arch enemy?<br>
Me: I said because, not became. It's 6.30am, and I've not slept, so my mind is a little out of it, sorry<br>
Nate: Because God respects our agency<br>
Nate: Even before this life He let us choose our path<br>
Me: But if he stopped Lucifer in his tracks, we wouldn't have things like war, and people asking you how magnets work. He kinda screwed up, eh?<br>
Nate: Not at all<br>
Nate: Someone else would have made that decision<br>
Nate: What good does it do to look at the past like that?<br>
Nate: It is always the case: If one person doesn't screw up, someone else will.<br>
Nate: If we didn't have our agency or ability to choose there would be absolutely no point to our existence<br>
Nate: Agency is required for thought<br>
Nate: If we cannot choose to think, then we cannot think.<br>
Me: Yeah but if I screw up, or you screw up, it's no big deal. If god screws up, it affects us all. And now we're living in a world where the devil roams free, because he couldn't be bothered to stop him before all this happened.<br>
Me: Tell the big guy I said thanks in your next prayer.<br>
Nate: God didn't screw up<br>
Nate: Lucifer did<br>
Nate: The same way you're screwing up in your logic right now<br>
Me: Actually, you're screwing up in logic. You JUST said "If one person doesn't screw up, someone else will." Implying that I was infact right about god screwing up. I'm aware that Lucifer screwed up before God, but God could have put him right before he got worse<br>
Me: It's like, if you arrest a kid for shop lifting, chances are he'll stop. But if you let him go on his way, chances are it'll just get worse. Imagine Lucifer as that little kid shop lifting, and God as the man who refused to prosecute. Now that little shop lifting kid is a major criminal, and the shop keeper knows, but doesn't care that it's all his fault<br>
