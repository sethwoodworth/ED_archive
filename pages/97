'''4chan Gaming''' (or "[[b]]dyagames") is [[moar]] in a recent trend of [[WIN]] [[original content]] delivered to [[4chan]] by [[Santa|Satan Claus]], just in time for [[nigra|Malcolm Xmas]]. 

Like [[EXTREME ADVERTISING]] and [[SFW Porn]], this [[meme]] requires moar thought-out [[shoop|effort]] and [[The Game|gamesmanship]] than the rampant [[flood detected|crapflood]] of [[newfag]]gotry such as [[forced meme|lame 'memes']] (like [[TOUCHDOWN THURMAN THOMAS]]), lame [[bullshit|semi-original]] content ([[Random Album Art]]) and straight-up [[facepalm]] threads ([[Confirmed For Brawl]] and [[Everyone Get In Here]]) that has recently been spamming up [[/b/]], much to the [[BAWWWW|chagrin]] of the [[oldfags]] already at '''10''' on the [[911|Whine-o-Meter]] since [[Foxing Day]] sent [[4chan]]'s [[Alexa]] ranking to the moon.

Although it is too early to tell, it appears that [[The Chemo That Is Curing /b/|the chemo that is curing /b/]] has [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|the cancer]] in remission.

==The Play==
It's quite simple: this [[meme]] calls for [[/b/tard]]s to fire-up the [[INTERNET PAINT MACHINE]] and create [[original content]] by shooping popular '[[video games]]' into [[WIN|4chan Games]].
