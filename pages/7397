'''Sexsomnia''' or '''Sleepsex''', not to be confused with [[Wowzaz 86|"I fucked her while she was sleeping"]], is a sleep disorder that causes you to hump people in your sleep, Or a really good excuse to [[rape]] your wife in the middle of the night when she`s not putting out. The proposed medical diagnosis is NREM Arousal Parasomnia - Sexual Behaviour in Sleep, and is considered to be a distinct variant of sleepwalking/confusional arousals.

{{quote|Back when I was working in the ER, I heard of a case where some woman got pregnant, and she didn't know how. It turns out she recently separated from her spouse, and he was living down stairs...he would come up stairs and do her with out even knowing.|-random asshole|}}

==Diagnosis==
To diagnose Sexsomnia researchers hook the patient up to a big fancy machine they made to read your brain waves. If the waves are just a little squiggly it means you`re asleep. If the waves are really squiggly it means you woke up. If the patient wakes up in the middle of the night it means he`s got Sexsomnia. The more he does this, and the faster he goes back to sleep the more he is innocent of the [[rape]]. apparently the brain waves of a person awake read exactly the same as if you where sleep-walking on this machine.

|I can have sex three or four times a night if the guys have the stamina, but in the morning I won’t know anything about it ...|Some [[slut]] named Haley Batty. |
We are in a very awful dilemma. My husband has sleep sex. He had done this for years with his previous girlfriend. Anyway, his stepdaughter from the other woman claims that when she spent the night my husband was touching her inappropriately. When the police questioned him yesterday he had to admit to that problem that he has done all his life and he said he did not know if he had done anything to the girl. He hoped to god not. My husband is the greatest man and this thing doesn’t bother me when it is between us. We will be seeing an attorney. I know my husband and he would not do this. But he is scared if he did. |Child molester's wife|

Finally we have two small children and they come to our beds sometimes and I worry about what might happen (there was a couple of minor incidents that the children each slept through that finally made me realize just how serious our situation is).| [[MOAR]] child rape!
