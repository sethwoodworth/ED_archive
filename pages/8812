Virii
This is the preferred plural for the word [[virus]] on the [[Internets]]. Anyone correcting it to "viruses" online is a spelling [[nazi]] and, worse, probably a black person. [[Image:nigga.jpg|thumb| INFECTION]]

Contrarily, "virii" is clearly unacceptable in speech or IRL writing. Using the word "virii" in these contexts marks you as a [[retard]].
