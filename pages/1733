'''Connecticut''' was founded by exiled [[batshit insane|batshit carzy]] people from [[Massachusetts]] in 1769. They quickly started growing [[tobacco]] along the Connecticut River. Aside from [[smoking]] all the time, they cultivated their tobacco into the greatest in the world. Since then nothing useful or good came from this state.

The culture in Connecticut is very [[gay]] and prissy. The founding of Yale University helped all natives to speak in lockjaw. Speaking in lockjaw (not to be confused with speaking in tongues) is a way in which the mouth does not truly open creating an arrogant sounding style of speaking. One of the benefits of lockjaw is that wrinkles do not develop on the face. However, the lips rarely open for anything else except for [[suck]]ing [[cock]]. Many Connecticut native females develop locked-pussy-lips which makes it painful for them to be entered vaginally, hence the explanation of why the state is so gay.

==Inventions==
Connecticut is known for its many inventions. Amusingly, the rest of humanity finds different uses for the inventions of this state. For example:

*The cotton gin was invented to mechanically [[sodomy|ass fuck]] its owners with a [[dildo]].
*[[Star Trek|Vulcanized]] [[Condom|rubber]] was invented to heat up to a hot liquid state so that men could easily manscape.  
*The frisbee was invented to deliver cum-stained love notes across campus.
*[[ESPN]] was invented so the gays of Connecticut could watch more young athletes wearing oversized cups.
*The submarine was invented as a place for a bunch of gay men to use cotton gins on each other.

==Anything worth noting about Connecticut==

Ever if you crash land in Confuckatit in a failed repeat of [[9/11]] and you have no way out, here are some things to remember:

*Connecticut people always have a [[Gay|pole up their ass]]. Do not, especially do not, flag down a driver to make conversation or ask for directions. You will probably get shot, because Connecticut is full of black person and [[Redneck|rednecks]] and they both be packin' heat.
*You can do anything in Connecticut, as long as you don't get caught. People here don't care enough to snitch on each other, and the cops are pretty lame, so unless you're a nigger walking down a street you are very unlikely to be asked any questions.
*A good part is, unlike most towns in America where niggers are spread throughout, towns in Connecticut usually only have a neighborhood or two (depending on the town) where all the niggers reside. This means they are easily avoidable. Do not confuse a good neighborhood for a niggerhood though, because every neighborhood in Connecticut save a few look like shit.
*Watchout for rednecks. This is important. Rednecks are almost as bad as jews and niggers. They drive around on the back of raised pickup trucks screaming, and in the backwater towns, throwing bottles or lynched nigger bodies. Confronting them is a bad idea. Just trust me. In fact, it is probably wise not to talk to anyone here you don't know.
*Prepare to walk in any convenience store or gas station and be face to face with a [[Indian|Ghandi]]. This is true almost anywhere, but it is especially awesome to [[troll]] them because it is so easy and they get so [[butthurt]]. One popular method is to walk in and insist to buy something they don't carry, they get pissed because only half of them speak English. Another way to induce lolz is too use [[DAMN NIGGA]] because they will only stare at you. Example: "These nigger products are so expensive I hope the holocaust happens and wipes out every single jew".
*Last but not least, do not mistake Connecticut's distance from the Mexican border as a safe haven. There are so many illegal Mexicans and [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican's]], a classic example that Spanish people are taking over the country and [[South Park|dey takin' our jerbs!]]

==Politics in Connecticut==
Connecticut politics was heavily influenced by the '''Great Carrot Shortage'''.

As everyone knows, carrots contribute directly to people's ability to see, and a lack of carrots causes acute visual problems. This is the only way to explain how this prissy group of people elected the first woman to be a state governor. Ella Grasso is known as the ugliest person to ever be elected in the world. So whenever you see an ugly person elected, you will always find a similar lack of carrots.

Governor John Rowland was forced to resign in 2004 because [[liberals]] claimed he was bribed with a hot tub. This is pure [[bullshit]] because his fat ass would not fit into a regular tub, so he had an industrial-sized pool flown in so that he could finally wash his crack. Rowland was accused of receiving expensive [[wine]] and cigars as gifts. The prissy people of Connecticut were inflamed, to which Rowland defended himself,

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">At least I use the gifts for their intended purpose. You won't see a wine bottle shoved up my wife's ass. And my interns never get a cigar up there when it truly calls for myâ€¦"</blockquote>

He was cut off before his statement was finished.
