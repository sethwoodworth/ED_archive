[[Transformation]] is a [[furry]] fetish that involves the changing of one species (human) into another (animal), which for one reason or another [[I came|gets people off]]. 

Like [[alcohol]], transformation is a "gateway" [[drug]] (er, [[fetish]]) for people on the [[Internet]], making [[normal]] people into [[zoophilia|zoophiles]] or [[sick fuck|worse]], like finding newfound pleasure in [[bukkake]] or [[anal]] [[rape]] - all of which can be found in copious amounts throughout Transformation stories and [[art]]. Fapping too much to Transformation stuff can lead to [[DO NOT WANT|horrifying self-discoveries]] about what turns [[you]] on sexually.

Although similar, Transformation differs from the heinous outrage going on at [[Boytaur|Boytaur.net]] because the former always has [[furries]] in it, and the latter just has [[The Power 5|nauseating pictures]] of deformed human monstrosities to which [[sick fuck|perverted retards]] chronically masturbate. Even at their [[furfaggotry|very worst]], believe it or not, furries are still better than that.

==Everything You Never Wanted To Know==
Graphic sex and bodily changes involving sexual organs are always the main focus of furry transformation -- [[you are doing it wrong|if it's not]], don't even bother reading it. 

If the protagonist of the story is a [[woman]], it can involve growing [[epic win|multiple sets of breasts]] (you know, [[LOL WUT|like a canine]]), or just having their breasts getting larger and [[WTF|"more sensitive"]]. Often this will include a destruction of the "human mindset", to be replaced by a [[OH GOD BILL|totally wanton and insatiable desire]] for [[bestiality|rough animal sex]]. Sometimes too, the said woman -- now no longer a woman -- will end up giving birth to inhuman offspring, like puppies or [[kittens]], just to add to the [[Pain series|sheer horror]] of the subject matter.

Transformation for [[men|males]], on the other hand, is a totally different story. Rather than bore with details and descriptions, let's have an actual transformation story [[yiff|speak for itself]]:

{{quote|Something more was happening to Cody though. His sheath throbbed hard as he could feel his human cock flexing strongly inside with each lick, swelling and eventually popping out against the dog's tongue. The boy gripped onto the desk a bit with his hands, blushing and moaning. 

"Ohhh Roscoe...please...stop...ohhh". He really wanted it to stop at first because it was pretty intense and strange...his shaft was burning with heat. The pounding heat got worse, Cody's shaft becoming more pink as it stood up erectly against the dog's rough licking tongue. 

"Ohhh...ahhhh" the boy felt dizzy, his penis throbbing and jerking painfully like it was fighting to hold back what was about to happen. But no matter how much he resisted, the intensity just overwhelmed him. 

The boy moaned hotly as it looked as if he had just experienced the start of an orgasm only instead of cumming, his cock flexed upwards sharply, throbbing and plumping up about an inch bigger, his glans changing shape becoming more tapered at the tip...The boy moaned again, relaxing more and blushing as another stronger spasm of pleasure hit and his cock surged two inches bigger, the base of it bulging out noticeably into the shape of a wide knot.|CodyDreamPuppy, ''Cody's Growing Pains'', Ch. 9}}

"Cody", by the way, is portrayed in the story as an [[Pedobear|eleven-year old boy]], and "Roscoe" is his best friend's Great Dane. Now if that ain't [[copypasta]]-worthy, [http://www.sofurry.com/page/61227?contentlevel=all nothing is].

===Conventional Methods===
Transformation can take place through a variety of means, the most popular of which is the [[fellatio|ingestion]] of [[semen]], or having [[anal sex]] (whether [[almost rape|consensual]] or [[rape|not]]) and absorbing the semen through the [[anus]]. The soon-to-be-not-human is always the one giving head or getting it in the ass. Often this involves a brazenly graphic act of [[bestiality]], as in the above example. At times this can be combined (before or after) by the animal biting the person being transformed, like a werewolf (see below).

[[Image:KerainenDatesAWerewolf.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Even [[gay]] werewolves can transform into something halfway cool...even if they kill their boyfriend in the process.]]

Sometimes transformation is achieved through [[boring]] methods like [[beer|drinking a potion]] or getting a curse - needless to say, this is far less popular, because let's face it, [[truth|sex makes everything more interesting]].

The best transformation material has the devolution of human into beast take place very gradually, drawing out the effect for maximum [[fap]] material.

====Weres====
Werewolves are the most common subjects of transformation stories and art -- and movies. Their main attraction is that they are proverbially ferocious and violent, killing [[Cow|livestock]] and [[loli|nubile virgin girls]], being [[MAN THE HARPOONS|impervious to conventional weapons]] and just all-around [[badass]]. During the daytime, they are fairly [[NORP|normal people]], usually [[oh noes|less than thrilled]] when they turn into a [[wolf]] under the full moon.

Of course, because furries [[X is now a meme|can't leave anything alone]], they have to add other stupid shit like [[Bear|werebears]], [[JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!|werelions]], [[Tatiana the Tiger|weretigers]], [[Stinkrat|weresweasels]], and pretty much every other animal furries fap to...which is essentially ''every'' animal.

It [[some argue|should be noted]] that, despite this grievous discrepancy, everyone -- furries and normal people alike -- can agree that the werewolves in the ''[[Twilight]]'' series are not real werewolves at all, but rather mangy, overgrown [[computer|CGI]] mongrel dogs. [[Furvert|Connoisseurs]] of the Transformation fetish object to the instant morphing of [[wolfaboo|said people]] into wolves (like in ''Twilight'', because the producers ran out of money making the [[vampire|vampires]] all sparkly and shit), instead greatly preferring long, drawn-out, grotesquely fascinating sequences like in ''An [[Americunts|American]] [[Werewolf]] in [[London]]''.

===Unconventional Methods===
There is a mercifully small minority of folks that believe, for whatever reason, in actual [[IRL]] transformation, outside of stories and [[art]]. Impossible, [[ad hominem|you say?]] Don't tell that to the [[Biofurs]], who think they can defy [[science]], [[common knowledge|logic]] and just plain [[lulz|good judgment]] to actually become a real animal, disregarding the fact that [[God]] and just about everyone else [[I am disappoint|hates them]] for it.

==Transformation and "Shapeshifting"==
Transformation and another Furry idiosyncrasy, "shapeshifting", [[opinion|are often]] commonly confused. 

Shapeshifting, on the other hand, is more innocent, usually done during [[RP]] sessions and when the author just decided to [[nobody gives a shit|give the fuck up]] on a complicated transformation sequence. A typical shapeshifting sequence is usually something like this:

{{quote|The silver dragon changed to human form, with gray reflective hair that he quickly slipped at hat over (Otherwise he would be mistaken for another [[Sephiroth]] wannabe). He also wore more colorful clothes, a green tee shirt and dark blue jeans.|}}

The [[My Immortal|terrible writing]] aside, shapeshifting is ''much'' tamer than transformation...but also, for that very reason, much more boring.
