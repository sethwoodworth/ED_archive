Rules of the Chanology

<br>
{{quote|These rules are unneeded and written by someone who was not qualified to write them. Improperly used memes, reference to old guard, /i/, and a bunch of sub groups, bad jokes, homage to wise beard man (which is just stupid), complete bastardization of "Rules of the Internet"|MegaPhoneBitch}}
<br>
{{quote|Hunter S. Thompsanon - thank you very much for clearing up who is and isn't allowed to be in Project Chanology.  I am very appreciative that there is someone making these kinds of calls on a day-to-day basis|bigfatspacko_uk}}

# Chanology is not your [[Moralfag|personal moral crusade]].
# [[enturbulation|Some]] in Chanology have placed the [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE]] to the back of it's mind, not due to a new-found sense of morality, <br>but because they make [[enturbulation|them]] [[fag|nervous]] about the [[partyvan]].

# Chanology is the first time Anons have left their basements in [[at least 100 years]].
