Ultimate Guitar
[[Image:Makingmusic.jpg|thumb|Typical UG user]]
'''Ultimate-Guitar.com''' is a [[shit]] site where all the [[guitar]]fags of the world have the chance to ape out at each other over who is better. The site's primary function is to host user submitted "Guitar Tablature", which helps [[retards]] who can't read [[music]] play their favorite new [[MCR|shitfest]] they heard on the radio. However, the main draw to the site is a Forum known as "The Pit", named for being the [[Internet]] equivalent to the sweaty [[gay]] [[orgy]] that [[metal]] and [[punk]] fans refer to as a mosh pit. Common to all users is a hatred for [[Guitar Hero]] (WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST PLAY A REAL GUITAR?), and a love of either crappy acoustic songs or wanky metal with the ability to play neither in public. UltimateGuitar is based in Russia and became the number one guitar tab site after mxTabs.net was raped by the Music Publishers Association of America. After consuming mxTabs, the MPA threatened UG, to which UG laughed, shit on the MPAs pride, all while promoting communism.

[[Image:Fuckug.JPG|thumb|right|Is this not proof enough? UG is a malignant tumor choc full of the cancer that is killing /b/]]
[[Image:UGBULL.jpg|thumb|right|Carmel(UG moderator) indeed spreading fabrications]]
The Pit is the sphincter of Ultimate Guitar and is one of most obvious attempts to be another [[ebaumsworld]] or [[Something Awful]] or [[4chan]], even though they'll vehemently deny it, while simultaneously talking shit about these sites, not realizing that all of the old memes they sit and gurgle about all day actually originated on /[[b]]/. In The Pit, [[newfags]] desperately struggle to gain recognition by licking the assholes of any mod in sight. Although a standard internet forum, the language in The Pit has degraded into the same moronic squawking and [[meme]]ing that can be found in other places around the web, albeit much, much more watered down and full of fail. The few members who have been on the site for longer than a week take the opportunity to break as many rules as possible before laughing at n00bs who attempt to do the same thing and get [[banned]]. UG even has pathetic attempts at [[fail|'raids']], where a member will find a video of a shitty guitar player (which is ironic, because the entire forum consists of shitty guitar players), and repeat to tell them how horrible they are, all while spamming "UG FTW!" Somehow, even though it is against the rules to do this on UG, the mods are lazy and do nothing about it. They'll lay down the law only a couple of times a month, normally just to set an example to the other members who will ignore it anyways. Some mods also take their [[Basement-dweller|job]] too seriously and ban the fuck out of anyone for the smallest reason. [[Nazi|This is completely okay though because the user broke the no spamming rule and posted something irrelevant]]. An example of common board discussion is as follows:

{{quote|You know the [[buttsecks|butt raping]] was the main [[pun|driving force]] behind our [[gay|tight and firm connection]]|theguitarist}}

It is also worth mentioning, that any time a [[meme]] is spotted on UG, it can safely be considered [[old meme]], and thus, no longer funny. Prime examples of old memes spotted en masse on UG include, but are not limited to, [[LOL WUT]], [[Shoop Da Whoop]], and, regrettably, [[Caturday]].

==Other Parts of the [[shit|Site]]==

=== Guitar Gear & Accessories ===
<s>A forum that can be potentially good, but is rife with [[idiots]] and [[trolls]]</s> A fucking cult where people jerk off to their [[Anal|analog]] gear and [[rape]] anyone who asks about anything digital or modeling. A used Peavey 5150 is the answer to any "Which amp?" thread, even when the threadstarter doesn't play a [[Metal|genre the amp is suited for]]. They do like fuzz, though. Start a thread about fuzz and you'll get replies almost immediately, seeing as the only people in the forum besides metalheads are [[Indie|indie kids]] who use copious amounts of fuzz to cover up the fact that they [[Suck|couldn't play if their life depended on it]].

===Tabs===
All of the tabs on this site are wrong, since it's all user generated content. Even if they managed to get the notes right, decent fingering technique is rarely observed. While it is possible to learn songs using these, you will waste more time wading through the 14 different versions of every song and patch-working them together then you would if you just listened to the song 3 times through and figured it out for your damn self. This issue will never be resolved as the only contributers to sites like this are horribly vapid teenagers or other layabout [[basement dweller]]s who never learned to read or play music properly.

[[Image:Ultimate guitar staff.jpg|thumb|right|These are the [[Russian]] party animals responsible for the site]]


===Bass===
This empty part of the forum is where you will see fat, annoying basement dwellers like "thefitz" (DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS! He left) bitch and cry about every aspect of music and life. If you want an answer to a question about bass, your out of luck because your thread will get closed faster than you can say "omfg jako pastorius sux balz geddy lee ftw and dean roxx!"



==The Cancer Killing UG==
Although many users are quite unaware of this, cancer is eating away at UG (mainly the pit) and can be seen in various ways, including:
* Mods abusing their power
* *Reported*
*[[not gay|I Cum Blood]] 
* Mods abusing their power by creating threads about [[shit that nobody cares about]] while drunk 
* Kensai
* Vauxite and his "bitchin' trainz"
* Mods abusing their power
* Searchbar jokes
* Mods abusing their power
* [[cool story bro]]
* Yuropoors
*Mods abusing their power
*RIP [[pantera|Dime]]
* <s>09'ers</s> <s>10'ers</s> 11'ers
* The Pear: Sometime [[last thursday]], many users started posting the 'lol wut' pear to an extreme degree. Though [[lies|funny]], the mods decided to get [[butthurt]] about it and [[ban]] anyone on sight for using it. <s>Not written in the rules, yet still bannable within seconds.</s> Now in the rules under the spam subsection, but up to mod discretion.


==Notable [[fag|Users]]==
===Fassa Albrecht===

[[Image:Fassa.jpg|thumb|right|Fassa Albrecht, the most beautiful user on UG.]]

On August 03, 2007, an ugly [[women|stupid bitch]] named Fassa Albrecht joined the forums, and to this day she's highly regarded as a [[troll]]. But really she's just generally [[Fat|thick]]. In the past, she confused and stressed the living shit out of the mods and other regulars on the forum by referencing Canadian prog band Rush in every post she made.

She then produced [[over 9000]] threads, which many of them became fair debates on topics that might, just might provoke some 
interest, unlike all her other threads which she used as a blog and made everyone [[rage]] harder over time.
<s>She was permabanned on the 27th of May 2010, a momentous occasion for every UG'er, and will be celebrated for many years to come</s> DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS!  <s>She reared her ugly head a few days later, crushing the hopes and dreams of every UG'er.</s> DISREGARD THAT, I WAS SUCKING COCKS AGAIN!. On Christmas Day of 2010, a miracle happened: Fassa was permabanned for real.

=== Coreysmonster ===

This German is the UG equivalent of Marmite. Hated by many, he often posts "stupid" threads that make people think. This is clearly beyond most pit members, and usually ends up with them choosing the "Purple spunky hippo" in his polls and then bitching about his  threads. If you are one of these retards, please kindly fuck off to 4chan and/or become [[an hero]]. Recently got his most desired wish by becoming a Column Cleaner, the UG Team's equivalent of an [[Bitch|intern]], making official what everyone already knew: he's [[God|Carmel's]] bitch.

=== Kensai ===

This yuropoor is the [[no life|most popular user on UG]], and there isn't a single thread where he doesn't post. He is regarded as the most sexy member in the entire site, because of one photoshopped picture and being from Sweden. Every user must lick his ass to be accepted by the Ultimate Guitar group, or else they become banned.


=== Riffofthebeast ===

Megatroll, only lasted a few months before he felt the wrath of the banhammer. One of the dumbest UG'ers ever, I'm too tired to write anymore about this asshole

=== TheReverend724 ===

Another unfunny Amerifag who thinks he's married to [[Attention_whore|Asuka Langley Soryu.]] Also tends to yell "[[Evangelion|NGE!]]" at anyone who enters the Anime Thread. Has recently taken a liking to the shitty [[One Piece]] ripoff Fairy Tail, and generally yells "FAIRY TAIL!" either in addition to or in place of (!) "NGE!" He now thinks he's a [[hip-hop]] producer because he makes shitty beats in GarageBand. He's genuinely surprised that this doesn't get him [[Secks|laid]]. Usually seen sucking the cock of his [[Fag|gay]] lover, Holy Katana.

=== Holy Katana ===

Yet another unfunny Amerifat who won't ever shut the fuck up about how he's [[Fag|bisexual]] and [[socialist]]. Fat, ginger, feminist, socialist scum, liberal faggot, and extremely smug, he's usually seen being a [[narcissistic]] prick or attempting (unsuccessfully) to get his fat ass laid. Like most pissdrinkers of his ilk, he enjoys mocking people to massage his very tiny [[Penis|ego]], often accusing them of the very things he's guilty of. For easy trolling, make fun of the fact that he's [[Loser|never been kissed]], something he's developed an unhealthy fixation upon.

=== JacobTheMe ===
This fuckface showed up around 09'. He is probably the biggest cry baby hipster faggot on the forum. Every post is a complete exaggeration about how "miserable" his life is. Don't be trolled though, he is a giant narcissist. The guy even made a group dedicated to himself, entitled the "JacobTheMe Fanclub". Who the fuck does that? This fucking loser.

However he does occasionally get drunk and call other UG'ers to sing them karaoke renditions of famous pop songs. A favorite occurrence amongst many of the forum's members.

===metabolicmaggot (The greatest troll that ever lived)===
Sometime around [[last thursday]], user metabolicmaggot was sent to Diamond Ranch Academy (DRA) for 10 months where [[buttsecks]], [[rape]], beatings, and [[serious business]] occurred. He claims that he was sent for [[lies|no reason whatsoever]] and that his parents were very strict with him. After graduating DRA, metabolicmaggot (moar like metabolicfaggot amirite?) said that he forgave his parents for sending him to such a horrible place and that he had learned discipline and self respect there. At first, pit users thought he was [[trolling]] until metabolicfaggot posted a picture of his diploma of him successfully graduating. This left over 9000 [[faggot|pit monkeys]] [[rage|enraged]] at how places such as DRA could get away with taking kids and beating them. But then as if that wasn't enough, [[at least 100]] days later metabolicfaggot created a new thread saying that he might be getting sent back for another 2 months. A shit storm instantly occurred with users telling him to book it and go to another city or country instead of going back to that hell hole DRA. Users had set up groups to raise awareness of the evil DRA, offered donations, and even wrote songs for the kid. He would post every one or two days telling users about how his life on the lamb was going and how he didn't have much money and that he was starting to eat out of dumpsters. He had finally set up a mailing address after receiving enough support and was asking for at least 5 dollars in donations. Thats when the troll was detected. Carmel had closed the thread with this last note attached to it: "Do NOT send money to people you "know" off the internet. [[lulz|Oh and just in case anyone was wondering, he's been posting from the same location throughout this thread]]." Yep, turns out he was in the same place the entire time.

[[Image:Dracertificate.jpg|thumb|right|The work of some epic trolling]]
[[Image:Metabolic.jpg|thumb|right|MetabolicMaggot while on his so called 'journey for freedom']]

After users had found out this was the work of some epic trolling and a scam to get money, this is what they had to say:
{{quote|I knew it!!|some user}}
{{quote|fuck that guy, I know a guy who has been to programs like that, twice, and its not a fucking joke or something that anyone should take advantage of to solicit money over the internet.|obvious butthurt user who got trolled}}
{{quote|that was an amazing troll. He really needs some kind of award...|some user}}
{{quote|This isn't brilliant, it's illegal and stupid.
What kind of fucking people are you to condone someone doing this? You're fucking worthless sacks of shit.|another obvious butthurt user}}
{{quote|seriously, anyone who sent him money is a fucking idiot and deserve having their money lost|some user}}

===Union Jake===
Long ago, their lived a user titled Union Jake. Said user decided to create a thread in the pit titled "I feel dirty,should i?". Turns out Union Jake had a union jack off party with 3 other room mates after being disappointed with watching The Prestige. After making this thread, epic lulz ensued at Union Jake's expense, until Carmel_l decided to close the thread for quote on quote "spamming". Said thread can be found [http://w9.ultimate-guitar.com/forum/showthread.php?t=952675 here].


==Original UG Memes and [[Faggotry]]==
[[Image:Yopit_copy.jpg|thumb|right|Even Xzibit is disgusted by the carrot top faggotry]]
[[Image:Hippochase01copy.jpg|thumb|right|Faster Tom!! Runn!]]
Believe it or not, The Pit has actually created their own little memes, which consist of saying "I Cum Blood" whenever a thread concerning music is involved and "Faster Tom Runn!!" when a user is in deep shit. Other memes include Herman Ri, tits on a whale, dimebuckers in a tele, gameboy soundcard in a pickup, "it's a stereo amp...", whammy without a whammy bar, crushing overdrive, searchbar jokes, "k koo", a douche bag with carrot top hair playing bass, circle jerk jake and ITS SHRED TIME! More faggotry is sure to come..

===Zagioh===
[[Image:Zagioh2.jpg|thumb|right|Zagioh himself]]
Every now and then, someone on UG will find a video on [[Youtube]] that is so full of [[fail]] that they will post a new thread about it. Well, that's where 'Zagioh' comes in. In the video, some 10 year old [[retard]] goes on about his [[yugioh]] collection and how he could beat anyone he wants to. [[At least 100]] UG'rs then commented on the video with saying 'UG FTW' and telling him that their [[pokemon]] cards could beat his shitty deck, and [[epic]] [[lulz]] ensued. A few hours later, Zagioh decided to get [[butthurt]] and remove the video, but someone had saved it before it was removed, and it can be seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDPvRpVOJWc here].

===Whatever===
In December of 2007, the UGer Page/Rhoads created a group on UG called [http://groups.ultimate-guitar.com/whatever Whatever]. Whatever has had regular members (known as Whateverens), its own memes, and lots of stories.
===The Whateverens===
*'''Page/Rhoads -'''(commonly referred to as P/R) is the founder and admin of Whatever. He is a complete faggot who lives in Michigan. He doesn't listen to any good music. He refuses to listen to any music that came out after 1979, unless it's metal. He once made a complete epic fail statement when he said that [[Slayer]] kicked ass an [[punk]] was a disgrace to music. In his argument, he said "Dude, listen to Slayer's "Undisputed Attitude". Its so intense. A great work by them." (Note: Undisputed Attitude is a punk covers album by Slayer.) At first all the Whateverens thought he was trolling, but he turned out to be serious. At the time, all of Whatever's hatred was aimed at Smacky, then after Smacky it went to Drome, but after it kinda came off Drome a [[shitstorm]] of P/R flaming started for statements like that he made 2 months ago. Today, P/R never posts in Whatever because he knows everyone there hates him. They hate him so much that Smacky made a group Whatever 2.0 (which no longer exists) because P/R said he was going to delete Whatever and everyone was like [[DO IT FAGGOT]] but he pussed out. irl he is a male prostitute who only sells his service to black person men and he makes [[over 9000]] million dollars an hour from it because he sucks nigger dick so great.
*'''Godsmack311 -'''(commonly referred to as "Smacky" or "Smack") is the real owner of Whatever. He was one of the originals in Whatever, and he coined the term Whateveren. He got permad from the forums because he made fun of Casey Calvert dying. Despite being loved at first, he started talking about how much he loves [[Hitler]] and hate [[niggers]]. Everyone in Whatever hated this so they started flaming him like crazy. He is the most flamed person in the history of Whatever. He got flamed so much he was like FUCK YOU GUYS and left and everyone was like YAY HES GONE but this soon changed. (irl Smacky's at the time girlfriend broke off with him for a black kid. irl he also suffers from avoidant personality disorder.). Then some faggot Drome (see below) came in and started failing every post because he was a total [[newfag]]. Smacky came back as a complete [[liberal]] shit anti-racist [[communist]] because everyone in Whatever told him to come and help them flame Drome. Today, he is the most loved person in Whatever, and his political stance in [[Ron Paul|Paultard]].
*'''dio_dude -'''Smacky but from [[Australia]] and without all the political shit. Also one of the originals. Was the first one to point out to everyone that Drome was a complete newfag. Also won the game when he tricked Drome into e-mailing him his UG password and then hacking his account (even though smacky did most of it). He was recently perma'd from the forums.
*'''Drome371/Delta3Xray -'''(known as Drome) Almost as big of a faggot as P/R. He came in, sucked up to P/R in everyone of his posts, and tried his best to fit in even though he was a complete faggot. He's also a [[Mormon]]. I'm not making that up. He really is. He was even a [[Mitt Romney]] supporter. He doesn't know any music other than [[Metallica]]. That's the only thing P/R is cooler than someone at, music taste and knowledge with Drome. He was originally Drome371, but then dio_dude totally fucking owned when he got Drome's password. Then Smacky posted his log-in information on /[[b]]/, which led to Drome371 being perma'd. Drome made a multi "Delta3Xray" and then the mods understood he was hacked so that shit multi isn't banned. Whatever has recently learned to accept Drome, even though he's still a massive faggot.
*'''mr freezy -'''From England. One of the originals. Like Smacky, he suffers from avoidant personality disorder irl. Him and Smacky often battle to see who's life is shittier.
**Freezy: bawwwwww my girlfriend left me for another kid bawwww
**Smacky: bawwww just be happy hes not black bawwwwww
**Freezy: bawwwwww stfu I have it worse bawwwwwwww
**Smacky: bawwwwwww no I do bawwwwwwww
Freezy is also openly bisexual and is a former huge pothead. He also recently turned into an [[emo]] who listens to Good Charlotte and Bring Me The Horizon and hates Pink Floyd.
*'''Le_meow117 -'''(called "[[Pokémon|Meowth]]") A canadian 12 year old who just does what everyone else is doing. "Hey guys, I hate Smacky. O wait, now I hate Drome olololololol." Not one of the originals.
*'''Wojtus -'''Meowth but doesn't hate anybody and is an original.
====A Sample of Whatever's [[Fail|Memes]]====
*The song Low by Flo Rida and T-Pain.
*olololololol
*[[Dream Theater]]
*The song Guilty of Being White by Minor Threat.
*[[THE BEST|THE BEST/FRANTICK]]
