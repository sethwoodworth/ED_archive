Vandalize Every Equation
'''''Vandalize Every Equation''''' is an organized [[Wikipedia]] vandalization effort and a [[forced meme]] started by [[User:jbs|jbs]] in the summer of [[2007]].

The average mongrel dumbass opines, to questions of Wiki-legitimacy, that while [[TOW]] is not a reliable source for humanities topics, it is a reliable source for factoids related to exact and natural sciences. ''Vandalize Every Equation'' hopes to systematically erode this remaining source of credibility by adding intentional errors into [[LaTeX]] equations. 

==Theory==
[[Image:DangerousEquations.jpg|frame|right|[[David Carradine|This]] is what will happen to mathematicians who see this if you do this.]]
[[Asspie]] [[Wikipedian]]s only know about useless shit [[noone|no one]] cares about and obtained by

#watching television,
#watching movies,
#reading [[fan fiction]],
#gaming, and
#using [[open source|open-source]] software.

Consequently, they never know anything useful, educational or credentialed. Therefore, edits relating to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge-kutta Runge-Kutta] won't be reverted for years, while edits to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter Harry Potter] page will be reverted in milliseconds, not because the edits were necessarily vandalism, but rather because the someone used an American spelling while the rest was in British form.

==Areas of [[Wikipedian|Wikipedian]] Knowledge ==
* [[Wikipedia Porn]]
* [[Star Wars]]
* [[Lord of the Rings]]
* [[Power Rangers]]
* [[Lunix]]
* [[Furries]]

== Areas of No [[Wikipedian|Wikipedian]] Knowledge ==
* De Casteljau's Algorithm
* Distributed Constraint Optimization
* Picard Algorithm
* Blackâ€“Scholes
* Fourier transform
* Vector Calculus
* The Finite Element Method
* Any physics problem that doesn't involve [[Albert Einstein|Jewish relativity]]
* Any formal languages or algorithms problem that doesn't involve the existence of quantum computers
* Linguistics topics that don't directly relate to Esperanto, Ido, Interlingua, '''[[Klingon]]''', Modern Hebrew, Sindarin, or some other [[asspie]] artificial language understood by nobody.
* The Genus and Species of Animals (Despite their knowledge of furries)

==How To==
Go into the source, and it will look something like this:

<code>[; \mathbb{I}=\mathbb{T}\cup\left(\underset{n\in\mathbb{N}}{\bigcup}\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{n}\right) ;]</code>

Now, make the following replacements:

{|
|-
! Replace every instance of || With
|-
| \frac || ''either'' \atop ''or'' \choose
|-
| \in || \subset
|-
| \subset || \in
|-
| \mathbb || \mathcal
|-
| \mathcal || \mathfrak
|-
| \mathfrak || \mathbb
|}

Wherever you see \xxxxx, where xxxxx is some Greek letter spelled out, capitalize the first letter \Xxxxx.

Wherever you see \Xxxxx, where Xxxxx is some Greek letter spelled out with the first letter capitalized, change it to \xxxxx.

{|
|-
! Change every || To
|-
| \exists || \nexists.
|-
| = ''sign'' || \neq
|-
| \cup || \cap ''and vice-versa''
|-
| \bigcup || \bigcap ''and vice-versa''
|}

[[????]]

[[Profit]]!

For more advanced vandalism techniques, you can study Advanced [[LaTeX| Cockulus]] or actually learn math jokes.
For example: <math>e^\pi-\pi=20</math> is a good test for floating point errors. As no one on Wikipedia can get the jokes on XKCD, they won't know this is a setup because they don't read it.

==Project goals==
The stated goal of ''Vandalize Every Equation'' is to discredit [[the Wikipedia Jews]] and restore mathematics and the sciences to its rightful owner, [http://www.springer-verlag.de Springer-Verlag].
<math>e^\pi-\pi=20</math>
