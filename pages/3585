'''Hal Wilkerson''', or '''Hal''' as he is more commonly called, is a [[forced meme]], and a character from the TV show [[Unfunny|Malcolm in the Middle]]

==Backstory==

[[Image:HalFSJAL.PNG|thumb|right|A forced meme of a forced meme]]

Some [[butthurt]] [[newfag]] on /[[b]]/ had decided, for no good reason, that Hal was deserving of being a [[meme]]. [[Milhouse|Well, in his defense, more deserving than others.]]

He had made one thread in the early morning, around 7AM [[Texas|Central Time]], [[Coincidence|just after Malcolm in the Middle had ended on FX.]] Many people had agreed Hal would make a good [[/b/tard]], but after a while, people saw it as nothing more than [[The Cancer|the work of a newfag]], and it left people's minds faster than [[Molest|that one time Uncle Jack brought you out behind the woods and...]]

Not [[An Hero|seeing the error of his ways]], he then flooded the board with production pics of Hal, posting in many [[Post ending in (x)|"Post ending in doubles is a meme"]] threads, [[Combo|Combofag]] and [[Fail|attempting]] to get [[GET|GETs]].

It pissed many people off, eventually resulting in it dying down. [[Too soon|But for how long...]]

==Attempted [[Win]]==

The forcing of Hal has resulted in a few GETs, but most went ignored, [[Milhouse|like some other GETS gotten by a failed meme.]]
