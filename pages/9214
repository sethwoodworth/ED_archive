[[Bel-Air|Now this is a story all about how]] this guy found an underage [[B&]] [[cumdumpster]] posting poopershots and making out with a black person. Also, the bitch had 3 videos playing with her [[tits]] on the shower. Anon got eventually pissed off and decided to take action. '''And it all went downhill since that very same moment.'''

== How it all started ==

Some guy made a thread on [[/b/]] about this photobucket account with an underage B& chick posting poopershots and videos of her masturbating, and what it was worse, KISSING A black person.

Anon got pissed. The thread was filled with niggers trying to take the bitch down. Eventually the thread got 404'd but threads were still made one after the other.

== The beginning of the operation ==

Eventually, [[User:Pato2747|Pato2747]] had the great idea of setting up an IRC channel on the Partyvan.info IRC; and posted it on the thread. In less than 5 minutes there were 15 people planning the demise of the bitch named xpeanutznlemonx.

== Act I: Myspace, self-pwning and the search for information ==

Combined efforts of anon [http://www.myspace.com/crazzyfor87 managed to find a Myspace], but it was private. The main objective was getting access to her myspace or get her to add one as a friend so the links for the vids could be dumped, and the [[lulz]] flow by.


A good tactic was using social engineering with their friends. A particularly [[lulzy]] one was this guy named Eric Stanley, who was dead and the target was mourning for his loss. After some lurking, Anon found out that [http://helpfindthemissing.org/forum/showthread.php?p=159098|the asshole got self-pwned after tripping and falling off the grand canyon.] Have a nice trip, Eric!

Eventually we got the name of a school. We couldn't pinpoint the location, but we narrowed it down to California, in the Arroyo High school. That was definitely something worthwhile. Also we got a house somewhere with 1219 as house number. All was being tracked down, and we all felt the [[lulz]] beforehand.

We also managed to get her name, Robyn, and phone numbers of school and some friends.

== Act II: The convo ==

We managed to set up a vent server where we could discuss it easily. We soon find out that there was a [[double nigger]] who ratted us out, therefore getting the target all scared and deleting her Myspace and photobucket.

You might be wondering why the Myspace is up again. You will see why later.

7 hours after the post on /b/, a fellow anon named haxorx got a hold of xpeacheznlemonx, and had a convo on AIM. He started to paste the thread on the channel.

<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (2:54:38 PM): anyways... the password for my photobucket is pinkpeanut
</pre>

The vent was filled with screams of joy: '''WE HAD THE MOTHERFUCKING PASSWORD.''' We were all happy, and soon started to try that password with everything owned by the target.

While that, we got another piece of convo that pissed us off again:

<pre>
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (2:55:14 PM): ok
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (2:55:25 PM): let me see if it works k
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (2:55:35 PM): Alright..

<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (2:57:15 PM): and just told me my password
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (2:57:23 PM): maybe hes from the fbi 
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (2:57:25 PM): thatss good
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (2:58:06 PM): ask him some personal questions
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (2:58:08 PM): like 
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (2:58:29 PM): if you work for the fbi why did you tell me your from the government
</pre>

A quadruple nigger from inside the IRC posed as the FBI and fucked up with the phishing. Rage came out from everywhere. Pato2747 said "It's just a matter of time until we hit with the octuple nigger". And damn, I was right. ->[[User:Pato2747|Pato2747]] 16:31, 30 June 2008 (CDT)

10 minutes later we found out the password wasn't working with anything. What the fuck was going on?

== Act III: And so we got owned ==

Then the shit started to hit the fan.

<pre>
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (2:58:44 PM): and did you know your myspace is back up
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (2:59:17 PM): huh what do you mean?
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (2:59:23 PM): No it shouldn't be
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (2:59:26 PM): I deleted it
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (2:59:29 PM): cheack it
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (3:01:00 PM): What the FUCK?!
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:01:03 PM): http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=392938550
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:01:05 PM): see
</pre>

That was not possible, there was no fucking way it could be back.

<pre>
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:01:38 PM): i added you i am that anon member the green one
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (3:02:00 PM): Well I deleted it. It's hacked and stuff
</pre>

It was never hacked. Target deleted it because of the fear of getting pwned by us, as she got ratted by the double nigger.

Haxorx started with the typical "OMG I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ALL THE SHIT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH LET'S BE FRIENDS":

<pre>
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (3:03:02 PM): So did you take the photobuckets down?
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:03:49 PM): i  used a direct c++ java script capability i can remote access the sites 
fttp and remove the videos
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:04:03 PM): who did you find out about it?

<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (3:10:29 PM): I guess
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:10:36 PM): yeah
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (3:11:19 PM): something like this happened to my friend before too.
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:11:24 PM): really?
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (3:11:28 PM): but no one helped her out
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:11:34 PM): wtf
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:11:37 PM): thats fucked up
</pre>

And here is where we were all "YOU BEST BE JOKING NIGGER":

<pre>
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (3:12:21 PM): It got around school and everything
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:12:26 PM): i whouldent worry

And haxorx unveiled himself:

<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (3:14:13 PM): Yeah she was said
<+haxorx> anonymousx1337 (3:14:24 PM): i put myself jacking of on the internet it made me famous lulz
<+haxorx> BatmansRobyn (3:14:30 PM): Now, this is a story all about how
<+haxorx> My life got flipped-turned upside down
<+haxorx> And I liked to take a minute
<+haxorx> Just sit right there
<+haxorx> I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
<+haxorx> In west Philadelphia born and raised
<+haxorx> On the playground was where I spent most of my days
<+haxorx> Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
<+haxorx> And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
<+haxorx> When a couple of guys
<+haxorx> Who were up to no good
<+haxorx> Startin making trouble in my neighborhood
<+haxorx> I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
<LeoDN> Ah, fuck it. I just want to see this bitch with a blender on her head. maybe a bar of soap too..
<+haxorx> She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
<+haxorx> I begged and pleaded with her day after day
<+haxorx> But she packed my suite case and send me on my way
<~Pato2747> Good game, fucker.
<+haxorx> She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
<+haxorx> I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
<+haxorx> First class, yo this is bad
<+haxorx> Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
<+haxorx> Is this what the people of Bel-Air Living like?
<+haxorx> Hmmmmm this might be alright.
<+haxorx> But wait I hear there're prissy, wine all that
<+haxorx> Is Bel-Air the type of place they send this cool cat?
<+haxorx> I don't think sow
<+haxorx> I'll see when I get there
<+haxorx> I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
<+haxorx> Well, the plane landed and when I came out
<+haxorx> There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
02* Xander (chatzilla@Desu-29D2A3DA.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) Quit (Connection reset by peer)
<+haxorx> I ain't trying to get arrested
<+haxorx> I just got here
<+haxorx> I sprang with the quickness like lightening, disappeared
<+haxorx> I whistled for a cab and when it came near
<+haxorx> The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
<+haxorx> If anything I can say this cab is rare
<+haxorx> But I thought 'Now forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'
<+haxorx> I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
<+haxorx> And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
<+haxorx> I looked at my kingdom
<+haxorx> I was finally there
<+haxorx> To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

</pre>

'''FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!'''

And here is the long-awaited octuple-nigger. All the operation has been set up by the OP from 4chan (Who could have very well been Haxorx). Robyn had nothing to do with the photobucket account. We were trolled for 8 hours total, and believe me, I could have done better shit on that time.

Or we could go to the more rational side and say that someone tipped off the target. Who cares.

== Epilogue: What we learned on that day ==

*If you fall off the Grand Canyon, you die.
*Trust nobody.
*Trolling is fun
*FUCK DA POLEECE


Good game, haxorx. Good game indeed.

P.S: What you have been waiting for: [http://rapidshare.com/files/125904842/Robyn_3_videos_72_pictures_slut_cam_whore.rar], yes, that's it, those are the vids.
