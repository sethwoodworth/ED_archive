First off, know that he's never gonna give you up, and never gonna let you down. That said, to [[Rickroll]] someone is to [[troll|intentionally misdirect]] them to a video of "[http://www.1227.com Never Gonna Give You Up]" from [[old meme|<s>one</s> <s>two-hit-wonder</s>]] 80's pop icon '''Rick Astley'''. For Example "[http://www.google-co.ath.cx Information On how to Rick Roll Somebody]". Basically, it's one of the lamest and most insincere songs ever, and we can tell the difference. So can Rick, because he has recently called the song "naff" (Britslang for 'lame, insincere, and cheesy') in several interviews about the [[meme]].

This concept of the Rickroll originated from the [[Duckroll]] [[troll]] (started off as eggroll, but got wordfiltered by 4chan) and has the same intent of pissing off the sucker who falls for it after he or she is  [[pwnt]] - for the 25th time. Linking to a video of "Never gonna give you up" or some variant thereupon has become the new [[Goatse]], though after the [[The Power 5]] being linked to a mildly popular song from the 80s really isn't that bad. Not to be confused with a [[Barrel Roll]]<br />

==Origin==
Rick Astley is probably the greatest person. He's from England... most likely the (only) greatest thing out of that shitter.

Read below for moar informationz.

== LOLWUT ==


[[some argue|Believe it or not]], the first [[noobs|people]] to be "rickrolled" were [[Scientologists]]. Says a lot, huh?

The roll part of the name has been apocryphally said to come from a [[4chan]] favorite, the "[[Duckroll]]". This was used the same way as the Rickroll, claiming a link was actually interesting and actually linking to a page with an animated GIF of a toy duck rolling across the screen. "Roll" became a universal suffix for similar fake links like [[Leekspin]], and with the advent of the Rickroll found its greatest success.

Rickrolling began on [[4chan|4chan's]] /v/ image board on the day of [[Hillary Clinton|''Grand Theft Auto IV'''s]] official website premier. However, due to heavy traffic on the website, it was impossible to watch the trailer for quite some time, so [[Anonymous]] took it upon himself to link everyone to a supposedly leaked trailer hosted on YouTube:

<youtube>oHg5SJYRHA0</youtube>
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0 YouTube Link] <br/>

Rickrolling has become popular outside of [[4chan]]. Many different website communities have claimed they invented Rickrolling, such as [[GameFAQs]], who [[Lie|claim that the Rickroll started]] on their ''[[Halo]] 3'' board. ''World of Warcraft'' gamers, ([[World of Warcraft|WoWfags]]), have also laid claim to inventing the Rickroll, and have beaten it to [[old meme]] death on their game forums twice as fast as [[4chan]] ever could have done. The Washington hometown forum on [http://www.ak47.net AK47.net], filled with a bunch of old guys with guns, is also known for having links off to the Rickroll all over the place.

<s> The motivation behind using this particular song as a troll is obscure. </s> It's a cooperative prank. The prankster gets to feel clever, but the victim doesn't have to look at something [[Offended|genuinely disturbing]]. All good memes have a purpose behind them. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">&#91;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources|''citation&nbsp;needed'']]&#93;</sup>
However, during a Rickroll phase on the ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' forums, it became clear that (as well as simply being [[lame]]) the song was believed to have homoerotic associations of some kind, and was thus used in order to try and induce disgust or revulsion in heterosexual viewers.

==Lolicatgirls.swf==

[[Image:Loli catgirl.jpg|thumb|It's like this (Picture of inu shoujo Hinata-chan from an Eroge game).]]

The file Lolicatgirls.swf is a fan favorite of [[4chan]]'s flash board. The flash file contained is a hentai dojinshi clip of an underage catgirl. It's delicious cake, you must eat it. lolicatgirls.swf is a meme on 4chan's /f/ that pre-dates Rickroll, but is the same concept. It's a loop of some guys dancing in a busy street to rave music, instead of [[loli]] catgirls, as the title would suggest.

As you can see this flash always promises less than it delivers and it comes in many variations: http://eye.swfchan.com/search.asp?q=lolicatgirls.swf

==Barack Roll==
On October 2007, some fucktard with a little too much spare time on hand make a new version of the Rickroll featuring [[Senator Barack Hussein Obama]] speaking out the song's words, but only the first half because the fucker was too lazy to finish it. Americans flock to Obama solely because of his skin color(OMG! He's a nigger! [[Lie|He'd make a great president!]]) so the video has received [[Over 9000|Over 100,000]] views. After Obama [[Black Jesus|became president]] this version also lost its humor factor and now joins all the other versions to do nothing but piss YouTube users off.

==Sony/BMG Attempts to stop the Rickroll==
[[Image:Rick rolled.JPG|thumb|right|200px|No one is safe from the Rickroll, not even in your schools.]]
[[Image:Ebayrick-roll.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Rickrolling on [[eBay]] produces epic lulz.]]

On Saturday, March 29 2008, [[Sony|SONY/BMG]] started sending out copyright notices to all YouTube videos that RickRoll people. Videos with obscure titles such as [http://youtube.com/watch?v=8Figpk6nJLQ Ex Girlfriend Stripping] have been flagged by Sony/BMG and YouTube in the hopes to collect data about RickRoll, as well as remove certain videos containing RickRolls.

==YouTube's [[ripoff|EPIC Rickroll]]==
YouTube RickRolled its users on April 1st 2008 by pointing all the featured videos [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu_moia-oVI here]. As such, rolling is now officially [[old meme]]. [[Goodnight Sweet Prince]]. However, The Lonely Island's music video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pXfHLUlZf4 Jizz In My Pants] has recently surfaced via the ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' forums, as a possible successor to the Rick Roll. The term "Jizz Roll", certainly has vastly more potential for creating revulsion in people, and thus [[lulz]], than the Rick Roll ever did.

Since Rickroll's death, Rick Astley, in order to [[Masturbation|keep himself entertained]], has taken to deriving [[lulz]] from the [[Retard|handicapped]]:

==The Great Michigan Marching Band Rickroll of 2008==
On [[Last Thursday|October 11, 2008]], the 350 member Michigan Marching Band rickrolled [[over 9000|over 110,000]] fans in the Big [[House]] at the Michigan vs. [[Ohio|Toledo]] football game. Instead of playing [[cripple|Paralyzer]], the [[retarded|ingenuitive]] band played a [[shit|well written]] version of the [[old meme|popular]] meme. This proves that [[Detroit|The University of Michigan]] is a great place to go to [[school]].

[[Image:Rickrollfail2.jpg|thumb|right|<del>[[facepalm]]</del>[[harpoons]]]]

In addition to being old meme, Rick Roll is now officially "[[gay|cool]]", mostly thanks to [[whore|Nancy Pelosi]]. If you see any one wearing one of these shirts, please [[kill it with fire|kill them with fire]].

==Rickrolling the Nation==

During the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Parade Rick Astley himself Rickrolled 50 million people. He appeared on during a song on the ''Foster's Home for [[retarded|Imaginary]] Friends'' float. Thank God it was interrupted, amirite? It ended with a diseased, bi-polar [[Azn]] stating that he loves Rickrolling which fucking ruined it and officially made it an [[old meme]]. It was also [[This Looks Shopped|''obviously'']] lip synced.

Best 9 seconds of your life.

==How To Rickroll Programs==
First you are obviously going to need the Rickroll video. Secondly, you will need an .exe. You can use any binder to join these but I recommend DON'T DOWNLOAD, IT'S REALLY PRORAT, A RAT TROJAN! (net tools 5 has an exe binder. use that.)

===Using Splice/Binders===
* Open Splice and in the first box, browse for your Rickroll video.
* In the second box, browse for your exe.
* Choose any icon (It doesn't matter yet) for your new exe and save it.

===Using Resource Hacker===
* Get [http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/ Resource Hacker].
* Open your exe with Resource Hacker and expand Icon
* Then look around until you find the icon for your exe.
* Right click on the Icon Number and click Replace Resource
* Click on Open File with a New Icon then browse for your original .exe (In B4 Rickroll). This will give it the icon of the original .exe
* Save it.

WELL DONE FAGGOT!
