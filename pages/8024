Tanasinn
{{boring}}

'''Tanasinn''' (タナシン) is an Internet  [[meme]]  that originated on the [[2chan]]. What tanasinn is, exactly, cannot be explained very clearly, but it is frequently accompanied by a surrealistic atmosphere. Often characters called tanasinn are expressed by Shift JIS art of a deteriorated Doraemon. It is said that it does not have a meaning; rather, it is not something to think about, but something to be felt.

One person [[anonymous]]ly posted bizarre Shift JIS art of Doraemon called “tanasinn”, so with that surrealism, the ambiguous art became known; the obscure meaning being unknown. These surreal posts generally came to be called like “feeling the tanasinn”.
