Jesse Jackson
{{stub}}
'''The Reverend black person is a filthy coon. ALL HAIL TORCHIC, MUDKIP SUCKS''' (or, if you want to be ''really'' respectful, <u>His Ineffable Ultra-High Holiness St. Jesse</u>) is an advocate of black person [[shit_no_one_cares_about|Civil Rights]]. In this case, Civil Rights means being chosen over everyone else and getting [[butthurt]] over anything that could be construed as even slightly offensive. He does, however, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/jackson.htm hate Jews], so he can't be too terrible.

==Early Life==
Jackson was born [[last Thursday]] in a New Orleans crackhouse to his single mother [[black chicks|Shawanda Jackson]] (see, cuz black people have only one parent, therefore it's a clever social commentary). From an early age, Jackson was aware of the terrible injustices black person faced on a daily basis. More importantly, he saw that it was possible to [[profit]] from said injustices. He also noted that under suitable amounts of pressure, white people succumb to [[liberal guilt|guilt]] and willing hand out money. Thus, his political career was born, despite the fact he helped [[faggotry|Zeus]] rise to power.

==Political Career==
Since you're all [[idiots]], you probably have no [[shit_no_one_cares_about|reading comprehension skills]], so I have to spell this out: Jesse Jackson's political career rests solely on [[bullshit]]. Almost every single thing he says about some horrible racist act is a [[lie]]. His master craft is the [http://www.capitalresearch.org/news/news.asp?ID=126 shakedown]. He has gone after [[over 9000]] non-racist(in some cases nigger-loving) companies for supposedly racist activities. His claims of course, were all [[bullshit]]. [[image: jesse.jpg|thumb| Jesse Jackson, bitching about some race-related scandal while baked.]]

The previous statement is of course, a [[racist]] [[lie]]. The writer of this article is obviously a cross-burnin [[The Man|Bossman]] trying to keep da black man down. However, thanks to Jackson's [[bullshit|heroic efforts]], oppressive whities like him cannot succeed in their goals. It's only a bonus that Jackson's [[bullshit|heroic efforts]] have made him rich.

==Rainbow Push Coalition==
Jackson's most [[lulz]]-producing act was his handling of the donations to the [http://www.rainbowpush.org/ Rainbow Push Coalition], the organization he founded that is supposedly dedicated to equal opportunity employment. He [[lie|truthfully]] gave $4,000 in donations to his goal of equal opportunity employment. If by equal opportunity employment, you mean [http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/08/16/jackson.mistress/ paying child support to his illegitimate daughter]. When asked about his obvious [[lie]], Jackson, shockingly remarked

[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/01/18/jackson.child.02/ "I fully accept responsibility and I am truly sorry for my actions"]

{{quote|Jesse Jackson was involved in a three-car crash this weekend. I understand that no one was hurt, but I understand that two of the women in the other cars are now pregnant.| Jay Leno, he was 3 of the 2 women in the accident, the other was [[your mom]].}}

To this day, [[Noone|no one]] knows what the fuck the Rainbow/PUSH coalition does.

==Obamanation==

Fed up with all the [[Obama]] cockworshipping both his own [[niggers|kindred]] and [[fag|liberal]] [[fanboys|base]] demonstrated, Jackson decided to speak candidly about Obama, also [[BME|accidentally revealing his unhealthy obsession with the presidential candiate's genitals]]. Unfortunately, the old media instantly became butthurt and spread the pain to everyone, forcing Jackson to apologize for his [[Sick fuck|castration fantasy]]. To be more accurate, Jackson lied and still has his [[necrophilia|plans]].
