'''[http://klulz.fm KLULZ]''' is a radio station run by [[unfunny]] loser [[jews]].

'''KLULZ''' was a perfectly good radio station until revmischa took it over under the belief he knew what he was doing. In order to achieve this spectacular coup, he enlisted [[Sloth]] and [[g0sp]] to alienate [[Penni|everyone useful]] from the website. They succeeded in this aim, and are now sole controllers of an internet radio station that would lose money if ezbake ever stopped ddosing it and it gained an audience bigger than ten people.
