Ecstasy AKA Darks
[[Image:Ecstasy_aka_Darks.jpg|thumb|right|The man, the myth, the legend]]
In a world filled with disgusting concepts like [[peace]], [[love]], and doing shit during the day, one brash 13 year old dared to rise above it all and declared to the world his love of "psycos", [[Green Day]], and staying up all night.

And [[a/|/a/]] listened.

Ecstasy AKA Darks is a minor, [[Old Meme|old]], and somewhat [[Forced Meme|forced]] [[meme]] that emerged on /a/ back in late Summer 2007.  Darks was discovered during one of /a/'s many bad [[fanart]] threads when an /a/sshole posted a picture of some [[Deviantart|Tartlet's]] [[self-insert]].  Fanart of Darks quickly dominated the thread and Darks became a minor fixture on /a/, and occasionally [[cm/|/cm/]], ever since.

Shortly after the first thread, subsequent threads were reported for being "non-anime". Fans of Darks countered by creating one tired [[unfunny]] thread after another.  This lead to the [[mods]] making posting pictures of the little [[emo]] fuck a [[ban]]nable offense.  But it's been 4 years since then and everyone barely remembers him now.  So who knows if that rule is still enforced.


To this day, no one knows the name of the Tartlet who created Darks.  The person who posted the picture never gave [[sauce]].

Sometime in 2010, [http://desubunny.deviantart.com/ some sick fuck] took /cm/'s supa [[kawaii]] version of Darks up to 11 and turned him into a [[Vocaloid]] [[trap]].  He still retains his love of staying up all night.  But now he has an even stupider name so the [[troll]]s won't find him, dresses like a girl, does covers of songs sung by voice synthesizers, and has buttsex with other characters for the amusement of [[yaoi]] [[fangirl]]s.  He also has a [[GAR]] rival named "Agony AKA Lights", because staying up all night isn't GAR enough apparently.
