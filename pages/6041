[[Image:MichealGcatabuse.jpg|right|frame|As of yet, still unknown M1CkY]]

On May 31st 2010, Some Anonymous IRC members made the name Operation: Dusty Trail on the [[Operation Dusty Trail#IRC|IRC Channel]]. Since then tons of epic lulz and shit has happen in teh chat inducing the finding of the real DOX of Mickey.

On May 25th 2010, Two videos of a kid named Mickey beating the shit out of a cat were uploaded to YouTube. On May 28th 2010, Anonymous discovered the video and commenced a nationwide investigation into this abuse. On May 31st, 2010 [[Ebaumsworld]] found DOX of Mickey. Thousands of dollars worth of [[Pizza]], [[Lulz|Mexican and Male Hookers]], and escort services were sent to the suspect's residence, and it is also said that [[Techno Viking]] had paid a visit as well. It was completely confirmed on June 2, 2010, that Mickey Gallegos was in fact not the culprit, but that [[Ebaumsworld|Ebaums]] gotten the wrong dox. Currently, Anonymous is zeroing in on the real Micky; following up on several leads and utilizing potential help from law enforcement.

==Evidence==

See pictures for Facial Similarities.

*YouTube video was posted by M1ckey, the same name he uses for his Myspace
*Kid in third video is called "Mickey" at 1:36
*Friend has a pic of a dead dog being hung on a fence. (Could be a coincidence, but it shows that Mickey and his friends have no problem in dealing with dead animals.)

Analysis on dad during KSAT Vid:
"Watched the video from the dad. I'm a body-/micro-expressions consultant for
the police. The dad is outright lying to protect his son. He shows
hesitation and retiscence by placing his hands in his pockets and
looking down to the left, all the while muttering his opinion. This
show...s guilt and is indicative of a strong ...lie.
Soon after, he finds a jump word "preposterous," and removes his hands from
his pockets while he launches into a fully rehearsed lie without pause.
His hands show as supplicant gestures, palms visible, and gesturing
strongly, indicating strong guilt and a need to distract from the
words he's saying. When describing his family's relationship with animals,
he blinks too often, closes his eyes entirely and turns his head up
to the right (to fabricate the lie), and shakes his head continuously
as a supplicant gesture indicating shame. Kid did it. Sorry, Dad." -Evan James, (oldfag) posting via Facebook.

Analysis of cat in original videos:

"This is the first time I was made aware of this video..I work in animal rescue, its obvious this cat has neurological damage from this abuse, which I also would guess has been going on for a very long time. The animal doesn't try to get away because it is obviously used to this abuse."
- Jennifer Green, posting via Facebook
