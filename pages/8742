Valleywag
[[Image:Valleyfag OwenThomas in his fagolescence.jpg|thumb|Valleyfag's big-tittied bitch of fagitude [[Fucktard|Owen Thomas]] with hair indicating he's deep in his [[fagolescence]].]]'''Valleywag.com''' or '''Valleyfag''' is a website where lame-ass [[hipster]] wanna-bes whose [[basement-dwelling]] faggotry prevents them from understanding [[Shit nobody cares about|Gawker.com]] references go to read about [[fucktards]] and [[Internet tough guy|Silicon Valley jackasses]].

Because Valleyfag is written for people who don't do shit about people who don't do shit because they are too busy working on the Internets creating things for other people who don't do shit, the whole site is a big Ponzi scheme.  At the top of this is the [[fagolescent]] Owen Thomas, a [[fag|Fagtard]] first class who thinks writing blog posts means twenty-something fags will fuck his bitch-tittied fat ass.  Since nothing really happens in the lives of internet nerds and the companies they create, Thomas just has to [[Lies|make shit up]] [[just for the lulz]]

==Why Owen Thomas's [[faggotry]] ==
He created a [[meme]] about Kevin Colvin, a fucktard intern still in college who called in sick to work to go to a party and then faggy photos of himself turned up on [[Facebook]] and his boss saw it.  This indiscretion most people are guilty of might have just filtered through a few e-mail chains, but [[fagolescent]] Owen Thomas decided to make it public knowledge on Valleywag.[http://valleywag.com/tech/your-privacy-is-an-illusion/bank-intern-busted-by-facebook-321802.php] making it the first thing anyone will ever find in [http://www.google.com/search?q=Kevin+Colvin&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a a Google for Colvin's name] after he graduates.

Thomas and Valleyfag do this often with [[basement-dwelling]] nerds just for the [[lulz]], but since he's a [[fat]] bitchy [[fag|fagtard]] doing it for profit, it's the epitome of [[anti-lulz]].  Another example is he said a drunk employee of a power server company caused an outage, [http://valleywag.com/tech/breakdowns/drunk-editor-kills-the-gossip-item-you-care-about-282558.php when that was just bullshit someone fed him].

On the other hand, they like poking fun at [[TOW]] so maybe they're not all bad.
