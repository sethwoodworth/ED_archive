===0000chan===

<s>[http://0000chan.cz.cc/ 0000chan] is a shit chan with only one board. It has no purpose and is a waste of space. All the posts are stupid and the owner needs to GTFO.</s>

Edit: Down for the count.

===000chan===

[[Image:000chann.jpg|200px|thumb|right|000chan logo]]

<s>[http://000chan.org/ 000chan] is a *chan launched in July of 2009 (the same day it died because of a [[DDoS]] attack, but this was fixed in a few hours). 

000chan is devoted to the eradication of cancer. They are currently under the construction of /ent/, a massive volume of streamed entertainment and games. The chan itself has many original well thought out boards, and have employed a location specific moderation force ([[Mods|army of mods]]). .

There was a Chicken Bar-B-Q on the main page for several days, though the other pages were still business as usual. Just harder to find. Faggots.

It appears that Bruns has once again given the boot to his best admin, [[User:Atlus|Atlus]]. This is creating a good deal of civil unrest and causing a number of users to seek greener pastures. Bruns continually delays the implementation of the "[[bullshit|new software]]" and has still failed to make the /ent/ board to function as promised. [[meh]].</s>

<strike>Edit: Site is v&. brb, fbi.</strike><br>
Edit of edit: The site has moved to [http://n0chan.org n0chan], the equivalent of old 000chan now owned by [[User:Atlus|Atlus]]. Bruns is no longer involved with the site.

===[[1chan]]===
[http://www.1chan.net/ 1chan] - A great site about trains. [[pretty_cool_guy|I think that 1chan.net is a pretty cool guy, eh likes trains and doesn't even mods.]]

*You would think that this chan would be one of the innocent ones. However most of these channers spent their time talking about horrible train accidents rather than train themselves.

===101chan===
[http://www.101chan.org/ 101chan] - Established [[last thursday|thursday]], There is nothing special about this chan, all chans are the same. The owner used to be [[Fag|Cone]], who is a pretty cool guy who will steal your girlfriend in a heartbeat, and doesn't afraid of anything xcept [[Hitler|Twistd]] who threw a bitch fit when Cone made a VIP board. the other admin was [[Desu|Holic]], but he and [[Hitler|Twistd]] had an epic battle and thus Holic's death ensued. However, [[Desu|Holic]] is back now and co-administrating with the new owner, [[Raver|n0xious]]... they seem to have a new direction to take with the chan. Stay tuned to see how that plays out.

has untold amounts of cancer! sorta swfish... Slow as shit until recently.
[http://www.godlov.co.cc/php/testfuta/index.html 128chan]
ONLY HAS A FUCKING /b/

===1024chan===
====We're dedicated to free speech!====

[http://1024chan.org/ 1024chan] is dedicated to [[free speech]], or so it says on the front page. The imageboard was made in an attempt to create a new imageboard experience where you wouldn't have to fear of your content getting deleted because an immature moderator does not agree with your viewpoint, or [[what|something like that]]. Actually, a few things are banned, though. Examples of things that are banned on 1024chan include child pornography and so-called [[Nobody cares|copyright protected content]]. Other [[Common sense|little known rules]] exist too, for example, advertising and spam will get you banned within a few weeks.

====History====

Opened on December 15th 2008, 1024chan continues to live on despite hosting changes and board-reorganizations. Some time in 2009, more than three quarters of the boards were merged in an attempt to simplify the site. Currently, the most active boards on 1024chan are /b/, /st/ (porn), /g/ (faggots) and /fet/ (-ish).

====Users & Content====

On the boards /b/ and /id/ ([[Lie|intellectual discussion]]) you'll find a lot of [[Retards|conservative propaganda]]. Nobody really knows why this is the case, but it is probably because of 1024chans dedication to free speech and the vast amount of pre-teen models on /st/.

===1961chan===
[http://psy.servebeer.com/1961chan 1961chan], the reincarnation of 3chan and zchan, is made out of some home-made engine so it's a little different than the typical *chan format, but it's the usual multi-board crap with little traffic like most small-time sites. (It also doesn't have a proper TLD, either, lol.) It is also ad-free and is not yet full of [[AIDS]] and [[fail]]. Like its predecessors, it's simple and tidy and is open to suggestions and shit.

==2==

===2ch===
[http://2ch.net/ 2ch] is the original chanboard, made in [[Japan]].

===2ch.us / Overchan===
Not an imageboard itself, but [http://2ch.us Overchan] is THE imagaboard directory. 

==3==

===31chan===
'''[http://www.31chan.org/ 31chan]''' is the first Dutch chanboard and part of the [[sarcasm|huge]] Dutch chan-community. 4chan [[meme|memes]] aren't welcome here and cancer receives an instant ban. In other words, a chanboard as should be only without the huge amount of visitors...

===36chan===
'''[http://www.36chan.net 36chan]''' is an imageboard dedicated to the discussion of video games. Unlike most imageboards, 36chan doesn't have 3 popular boards and 50 completely dead boards (3 so far, bur more to come). Wiki is used for generic, '''RELATED''' articles. Other boards will include technology, random, music, and wallpaper. Also has a wiki and an IRC.

'''Major Boards'''
*[http://www.36chan.net/vg/ Video Games] - For the vydia!

==4==
===4chon.net===
[http://4chon.net 4chon.net] is a relatively new imageboard with only two boards: a stable and well-used [[R9gay|/r9k/]] board, and a /new/ board.
===4chon.org===
[http://4chon.org 4chon.org] is the [[shit|shittiest]] imageboard known to [[furry|man]] [[lie|priding]] itself on being a clone of [[4chan]] [[shit no one cares about|while not being one]]. It contains so much [[fail]] and [[aids]] that it has it's own [[Epic Fail Guy|EFG]] board. Possibly worst known for putting in a [[R9gay|/r9k/]] board and then getting spammed to death in it's first day. Even worse, there's a board specifically there to [[IB4F|spam your own shittyass chan]]
====Shit-tier Boards====
*[http://4chon.org/b/ /b/] - [[888chan|Thunderdome]]
*[http://4chon.org/x/ /x/] - [[Xenu]]
*[http://4chon.org/r9k/ /bawwfags/] - ROBOT9000
*[http://4chon.org/new/ /stormfront/] - [[Tinfoil]]hats everywhere
===47chan===
[http://www.47chan.net 47chan] is an imageboard full of newfags and raid [[cancer]] used primarily for discussing [[Habbo_/B/lockade|Habbo raiding]] and further abusing [[forced memes]]. Has a wiki. Anything posted more than once immediately becomes defined as a meme. Users aspire to mimic the accomplishments of the past and constantly call for raids and /b/lackup, hoping to actually achieve a complete swastiget more than once a year then make shitty videos of their half-assed efforts. Collecting furni, making habbofag friends, decorating rooms and [[cyber|cybering]] have been considered acceptable uses of time on Habbo. Admins seem prone to misinterpretation of people's ideas and writings and excessive vanity when something actually doesn't have shit to do with them or their chan.

==5==
==6==

===6-chan===
'''[http://www.6-chan.org/ 6-chan]''' is a Chilean board created July 2008. The first admin is Takato, but in a benevollent act of humanity, gives the power to our new gobernant, '''[http://www.twitter.com/sebastianpirana/ Mr. Sebastian Pirana]''', president of the <strike>empire</strike> republic of Chile, economist and pussy troll in the internet.
They're allowing non-chilean IPs now!.

==7==

===789chan===
[http://789chan.org 789chan] is a relatively new chan centered around technology and is known for not tolerating bullshit and [[cancer]]. In 2009, it began hosting [[List of *chan boards#Legi0n|Legi0n]], the chan that hosts the /cwc/ [[Chris-chan]] board after [[List of *chan boards#Krapple Komputer Kompany|Krapple Komputer Kompany]] was TOS'd by its host. On New Years 2009, the users of the site waged war against 94chan after they and the owner of 94chan got fed up with [[Brittany_Holechko|IHM]].

===72chan===
[http://www.72chan.org 72chan] A new *chan filled with [[faggots]] that [[spam|spam their shitty board all over the place]]

==8==

===808chan===
[http://808chan.org 808chan] is the AIDS-ridden [[zombie|spiritual successor]] to [[888chan]]. It noticeably has 100% less [[Chanology|Faggotology]] (but having 100% more [[faggotry]]) and is run by someone who [[lie|isn't that much]] of a [[User:R3x|complete fucking kike]]. [[Shit_no_one_cares_about|Went up as a live work in progress on May 3, 2010.]]

'''Notable Boards'''

[http://808chan.org/nig/i/ Invasion] [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/i/ /i/], obviously.

=== 9001chan ===
[http://www.9kchan.org/ 9001chan] A new *chan with [[potential]]. The site can be reached by multiple url's, such as 9kchan.org, 9001chan.org, and 9000chan.org. Its boards are all currently SFW, but the admin has said to be looking into hosts that will tolerate 18+ material. The *chan is currently listening to and more often than not creating boards suggested by users.

'''Boards'''
9001chan, along with boards, has "sub-boards", inside many of its boards. All posts in the sub-boards are viewable in the main board, and if a user goes to a sub-board, only threads created in that said sub-board will be viewable.

===AnonSleepoverChan===
[http://anonsleepover.org/imageboard/ ASChan ] is a chan made [[Last Thursday]]. Its main purpose is to showcase movies and tv shows on livestream before the channel gets V& and they have to start a new one. Medium amount of activity. If you like movies and TV shows and don't like to pay for them, (i.e. having common sense) this chan is for you.
===Anonymous Chan (Anonchan)===
Not to be confused with AnonSleepoverChan
[http://www.anonchan.net ] is a chan made [[Last Thursday]]. No really, It was literally made [[Last Thursday]]
<br>
This is one of the first Chans that has a completely anonymous administration staff. All mods and admins post Anonymous ##
All boards also are forced Anonymous.
<BR>
Anonchan runs on [[Kusaba]]

===AwsumChan===
[http://awsumchan.org AwsumChan], or FailChan, was made by a [[faggot]] hailed as [[circlejerk | Circlepuller]] in May 2009 while he was likely fapping to himself. The boards located on the site are full of [[GET]]s and staff requests, among other cancer bullshit. The faggot admin encourages you to stop lurking and get fucking posting.

==B==

===Bala-chan===


[http://www.bala-chan.tk/ balachan] is a relatively new chilean board, made due of 6-chan cancer, the have move on, and now ieethe have their own home. This was a massive pile of [[fail|win]].

===Bawwchan===

===Bounceme===
[[Image:Bounceme_samefags.png|thumb|Keep in mind that [[Cracky-chan]] was fail in 2005]]

Once the super secret headquarters of the [[fail|l33t]] stalkers who tracked down [[Cracky-chan]].

Now a place for the Crackyhouse [[samefag]] to post even more samefaggotry, except with occasional pictures of children to break up the page. Only worth visiting to watch him freak out when you post anime, [[boxxy]], or just anything at all.

[http://195.242.99.71/cracky/ The cracky board] is as interesting as the picture here suggests, and there is an even secreter even l33ter board [http://195.242.99.71/eos/ here], but still full of fail. Bounceme is unmoderated (the former owner really did [[an hero|see sense]]) and is pedobear approved.

==C==
===Canadachan===
[http://canadachan.org/ Canadachan] is yet another new, mostly lifeless imageboard with little to no audience or posts, except that this one is devoted to the most [[boring|incredibly superior]] country in the world, [[Canada]].  It was created [[last Thursday|in March 2008]] by some dweeb called N_DONG, who is quite possibly a hopeless [[moralfag]] judging by his site FAQ:
{{tinyquote|[[mundane|CanadaChan is an assortment of imageboards designed to empower Canadian citizens anonymously through the internet. Consider it a safe place to talk about controversial subjects without giving out your personal information. CanadaChan is also a great place to collaborate on group projects for a range of topics and discuss ideas regarding anything in the creative spectrum]].|[[LOLDONGS|N_DONG]]}}

Canadachan's major boards include [http://canadachan.org/main/can/ /can/] (Canada General), boards for each of the provinces (except for the little sucky ones that [[Shit nobody cares about|no one cares about]]).  

===Chan.pl===
[[Image:chanpl_logo_full.png|thumb|Chan.pl's [[weeaboo]] logo]]
[http://chan.pl Chan.pl] - recently created Polish image board. It's pretty much empty most of the time, but fills with people the moment [[List of *chan boards#Karachan|Karachan]] happens to be down. Oh, and the admin is a [[attention whore|woman]] (she even showed tits).

===ChanSluts (formerly ChanChan)===
[http://chansluts.com ChanSluts] is an imageboard known for inviting [[fat]] [[16 year old girl|16 year-old girls]] to post their tits in addition to modfaggotry. Failure to utterly support the mods' worshipful stance towards the latest ugly scenefag poser results in a [[permaban]].

=== Chañ.org===
[http://chañ.org Chañ.org] is a spic/spanish imageboard.

===ChatChan===
[http://testforchatchan.webs.com/index.html ChatChan] is a small website that thinks it's 4chan (No shit, it keeps saying 4chan not ChatChan).

===Crackyhouse===

[[Image:The_last_crackyfag.png|thumb|...and in a few minutes he will reply to himself...]]

This former [[Cracky-chan]] fansite is currently haunted by a single, solitary [[samefag]]. He spends all day, every day posting walls of text to himself, about himself, and then agreeing with himself.

Only ever worth a visit due to the fact that he [[Asperger's Syndrome|hates other people posting on "his" image board]] (Crackyhouse is in fact unmoderated, the owner having [[an hero|done the decent thing]]), and will work himself into apoplexy if anyone posts anime. Or anything. He even freaks out at spambots, and has lost an argument to one in the past.

===DartChan===
[[Image:mycackgrowsfot.jpg|thumb|Every single post on DartChan.]]
[http://www.dartchan.org/ DartChan] - An imageboard specifically for students at UMass Dartmouth. Started so that all the nerds who play Humans vs. Zombies would have some place to gossip about each other. It's basically a massive circlejerk with the same five people posting on it, who all sit at the same lunch table. The board is practically dead, getting maybe three posts a day.

Recently, a kid called Marvin became a meme after he threatened to [[wut|hold someone down and piss in their mouth]] for ridiculing his article in the school paper. Tragically, no lulzy manips resulted from the incident.

Another notable person-meme is that of Sailor Bettina, some hot Viking chick who draws a moon on her forehead every morning with magic marker. She is [[insane|completely stable]].

Other memes include Cack Ryder, Ryan's head, FOT CACK, and unfunny racism.

===Delicious Cake!===

*[http://junkuchan.org/j/ /j/] - "Junku (LOL RANDOM)", basically Junkuchan's [[b|/b/]], very [[boring|tame]] for a random board.
*[http://junkuchan.org/jdb/ /jdb/] - "JunkuDB", Junkuchan's very own *booru.  Contains a shitton of [[awesome]] [[Rozen_Maiden|Rozen Maiden]] [[weeaboo|doujinshi]] and some depraved [[loli]] bullshit.  Good for [[loli]] dumps and not much else.
*[http://junkuchan.org/loli/ /loli/] - "Immoralità", a redundant and completely useless [[loli]] board, contains senseless [[italian]].

==K==

===Karachan===
[http://www.karachan.org Karachan], currently the largest [[Poland|Polish]] image board, the successor to tapchan, vichan and erischan. Populated by ex-/b/tards from [[4chan]] and [[hipster]] normalfags with an obsession on anonymity and oldfaggotry. Anything that doesn't fit to their tastes is automatically labeled as "[[cancer]]". They live in constant fear that their obscure site may become mainstream, so they implement all sorts of [[fail|"security methods"]] to keep it safe from outsiders. From time to time they attempt to [[epic fail|"raid"]] some godforsaken website or "stalk" members of their own society that are [[Attention whores|not true Anons]].
One of the mods is a 14 year old [[drama queen]], go figure.
Knowing the history of Polish chans, Kara will probably die off due to some bullshit reason, and all of its users will move to another image board (most likely [[List_of_*chan_boards#chan.pl|chan.pl]]).

==L==

===LocalChan ===
[http://localchan.com LocalChan] is a location based imageboard. Helping anon find anon to do anon type things.

===Lolzchan=== 

Now featuring boards: LOL, Code, Media, and Draw. 
[http://lolzchan.org]

===Loopchan===
[http://loopchan.org Loopchan] is an imageboard which covers general interests, pr0n and media. Also in development is a Loopchan BitTorrent tracker and Loopchan Radio. There is an on-going competition to get wimminz to post their tits with Loopchan written on them. Features an invasion/insurgency board called /hell/.

===Lucidchan===
[http://lucidchan.org Lucidchan] is an imageboard made for discussing lucid dreaming, astral projection, and more.

==M==

===Mikuchan===

[[Image:HatsuneMikuSD.png|thumb|right|? Miku Miku Miku ?]]
[http://mikuchan.org/ Mikuchan], a fledgling *chan grown from the [[pedo|unholy]] stock of [[Desuchan]], was created in spring of 2008 as a niche *chan devoted to Yamaha's line of [[Vocaloid]] software, and its cast of characters, the Vocaloids.

Mikuchan hosts boards for most of the official vocaloids (/miku/, /rin/, /kaito/, /meiko/, /gakupo/, /luka/), some of the major doujin vocaloids (/haku/, /hagane/, /neru/, /utau/), as well as a general /vocaloid/ board for the rest. Having once sported a fine collection of [[pr0n]]/[[guro]] boards, Mikuchan is now limited to just one /h/ board; the rest of the boards are basically a festering clump of "off-topic" boards, ranging from copies of [[4chan]] boards — [[video games|/vidya/]], [[MS Paint|/art/]], etc — to niche boards such as /tsun/ (for tsunderes), /vn/ (for visual novels like [[Fate/stay night]]) and /tans/ (for OS-tans and other cute/hot 2d girls). Mikuchan's once-crowning glory, /onoff/, has itself spawned yet another *chan, [[Uboachan]], for Uboa and Yume Nikki discussion. Mikuchan's regulars mostly hang around on IRC fapping to traps (or Uboa) and trying to think up ways to <s>take over the world</s> get people to visit their website.

Mikuchan is loosely affiliated with [[Desuchan]] (of course) and [[List of *chan boards#Maruchan|Maruchannel]], and is now hosted by the [http://nekoarcnetwork.com/ NekoArc network].

'''Admins:'''
*loliwut
*1337fag
*Moralfag Prime
*Hatsune Miku
*[[It is a mystery|who knows???]]

'''PROTIP:''' [[Uboachan|/onoff/]] is the most [[awesome]] thing on the internets.
===MineChan===
[http://minechan.org/ MineChan] is a textboard made popular from the game [http://minecraft.net Minecraft]. What also makes the site popular is the signature service they provide for free! It is located [http://bbs.minechan.org/sig/ here]! The cancer killing the site is also the signature service as everyone mostly visits just for that but doesn't really post.

===Moochan===
[http://moochan.org/ Moochan] is an extremely new chan, devoid of the [[Cancer|cancer]], the mods ban [[Boxxy]] and all newfag material, something of a safe haven for ye olde faggots, not many boards so far unfortunately, but they're still taking suggestions.

===MUSIChan===
Imageboard for music junkies and unsigned artist

http://musichan.net

===mxchan===
[http://www.mxchan.org mxchan] is a [[Mexican]] chan with [[Sarcasm|a lot of users]]. It has a /ñ/ (random) board, an /ar/ alta resolución (that's mexican for high resolution), /me/ for media and the all known /v/ which sucks. Registered since Dic. 2009. Owner is called "mxoot", a pirate copy of [[moot]], which makes sense since Mexico is to piracy what a homeless dog is to fleas.
It runs on [[Futallaby]] and they also have a Yotsuba theme that [[stole|resembles]] a lot 4chan's Yotsuba.

==N==

===Neechan===

[http://neechan.org Neechan] is one disturbingly full board of pure loli [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Denial (at least that's as far as I got before my eyes bled)].

===NekoArc Network===
Ran by [[WTF|god knows what]], [http://nekoarcnetwork.com NekoArc Network] is something akin to an [[iichan]] clone, in that it [[holy shit|hosts nearly anything weeaboo]]. Examples include Mikuchan nad [[KonataChan]]. There are a shitton of useless services like a [http://files.tsukihi.me anonymous file uploader], [[Left 4 Dead]] mod hosting, and [[partyvan.info]]. If you ever go to the [http://nekoarcnetwork.com/bro/ /b/ros] board, you'll see nothing but lonely [[Eve online]] manchildren posting how they've [[troll|trolled]] other corps and other lame shit like that. Also has a dead [[Tsukihime|Type-Moon]] board.

===Nigrachan===
[http://www.nigrachan.org Nigrachan] is the [[Truth|best imageboard ever]]. Launched in [[Last Thursday|early 2010]] by [[User:Afroduck|the same oldfag]] who used to run [[Pool's Closed]], the boards are truly [[cancer]]-free due to the [[Banhammer|strict moderation]], but [[some argue]] that the lack of cancer might just be due to the lack of posts. The imageboard software is a custom build of [[4chan|Futallaby]] and has [[over 9000]] bugs, but it's the content that matters, [[Yes|is it not]]?

The first time you visit Nigrachan, you'll feel some sort of ecstasy unlike anything you've felt before, known as the '''Nigrachan experience'''. The board's designs are a mix of black person awesomeness and [[Vomit|green]] loveliness, further contributing to the experience which consists of VIP posts, the images, the awesome board software, the [[Lie|active]] community, and the [[Nazi|totally cool]] administrator [[Shit nobody cares about|known as DerpLulz]].

====Boards====
* '''/a/ - Animu''' -- Used for dumping pictures of [[Desu|Suiseiseki]].
* '''/b/ - Random''' -- 50% of posts here are about [[In the kitchen|kitchens]], [[furries]], and [[cocks]] made in [[MS Paint]].
* '''/bb/ - Beavis & Butt-head''' -- Used for posting cartoons.
* '''/troll/ - Trolling''' -- [[Dead|Defunct]] board. Was killed because nobody wanted to troll anything else than [[Habbo Hotel]].
* '''/w/ - Womyn''' -- The best board on any chan ever. [[Nothing|Everything posted here]] is VIP Quality.

===not7chan===
Scratch the above, '''[http://n7c.org/ not7chan]''' somehow found a way to be even less popular than Nochan. Presently consists of a blank page with loud music.

===Not Jackie Chan===
[http://notjackiechan.org Not Jackie Chan] is the [[Truth|worst imageboard ever]]. Founded in Summer 2009 by [[User:Cybaiotron|some fag]] via [[Ib4f|IB4F]], it quickly grew into something of an incomprehensible and unspeakable mess. After being picked up by chan3.org and promptly abandoned due to massive drama, this ungodly beast of obnoxious background music and [[99chan|useless boards]] was granted a domain name by [[Jews|mysterious benefactors]]. It lives on, beckoning for a return to [[Something Awful|the anti-social age]] of the [[Al Gore|Internet]] in an [[Web 2.0|era]] filled with [[Anonymous|wannabe idealists]], [[Wikileaks|rapists]], and [[Mark Zuckerberg|creepy Zionists]]. It purposely keeps out of [[Drama|imageboard "culture"]] and is largely reclusive due to [[Meximoot|having no money for advertising]] and toplists being [[Chan top list#Death and Rebirth|fucking useless]].

====Boards====
* '''/b/ - Idiotic Chucklefucks''' -- Listen to [[YTMND|shitty background music]] and talk about whatever.
* '''/slam/ - Slam your head on your keyboard''' -- Slam your head on your keyboard and post it. It's fun.
* '''/meta/ - LET'S TALK ABOUT THE INTERNET''' -- [[Oldfag#Oldfags|Whine about how fucking terrible the Internet is.]]
* '''/gong/ - Girl or Not Girl''' -- COME ONE, COME ALL! GUESS THE SEX! BIG MONEY! BIG PRIZES! I LOVE IT!
* '''/asy/ - Insanity''' -- Talk about [[Insane|crazy people]].

==O==

==P==

===Petichan===
[http://petichan.org/ Petichan] A site dedicated to furries and any other fetish you may have.

===Plus4chan===
[http://plus4chan.org/ Plus4chan] describes itself as ''a shitty little site hosting boards and services for 4chan communities.'' It acts as a place for basement dwelling comic book geeks to cry in whenever 4chan's /co/ is down. It contains the boards '''/a/''' - [[Avatar the Last Airbender|Avatar]], '''/baw/''' - [[b/|/co/ General]], '''/co/''' - Comics & Cartoons, '''/coc/''' - /co/ Creations, '''/cog/''' - [[V/|Gaming]], '''/jam/''' - [[Animu|Japan, Anime, & Manga]], '''/draw/''' - [[MS Paint|Drawfaggotry]], '''/pco/''' - [[Promotion|/co/ Promotions]], '''/mspa/''' for Homestuck related bullshit, '''[[N|/n/ - News]]''' (created right after moot got rid of 4chan's News board), and '''/durp/''' - A board whose theme changes every week.
Notable is its' [http://plus4chan.org/b/baw/res/277619.html "4chan Complaint Thread"] where /b/tards escape to safely bitch about m00t's latest doings, and for it's /n/ board, which gets filled with /new/sfront refugees everytime m00t decides it's time for the final solution and shuts /new/ down.

The owner, Anonex, is renowned for being a lazy arsehole who never completes projects.  He had a good board going, but in Fall 2010 he decided to make it better, by taking it down, replacing it with new software with none of the bells and whistles the old board had, and then telling the users to wait until he got around to improving it again.   The userbase is still waiting.

On Christmas 2010, Anonex announced 7 days of after Christmas "gifts" to improve the site.  He got as far as day 2, implementing dedicated Minecraft and TF2 servers for the board - and then promptly vanished.   Rumor has it he's been playing Minecraft non-stop since then, and has possibly been eaten by a creeper.

===<s>Poschan</s>===
<s>[http://www.poschan.tk/ Poschan] was a chan dedicated to good posture, and designed to keep cancer out. Succeeded by being [[lol|completely unpopular]].</s> '''Baleeted'''

===Push the Fat===
[http://pushthefat.com/ Push the Fat] Is some weird ass chan with boards for ass and fat people. Possibly a site designed for trolling Tahko of [[IMG!]], but I have no fucking clue.

==R==

===Ro2Chan===
[http://chan.sunohara.org/ Ro2Chan] is a Romanian imageboard created mainly for Role Playing purposes.

==S==

==='''SEGAchannel'''===
[http://segachannel.net/ '''SEGAchannel'''] is a 'safe for work' [[Sega Genesis|Sega]]-based imageboard.

===Squisso===
[http://img.squisso.com/b/ Squisso] is an imageboard for Squid. Das Island. or something.
A slow moving site, pretty decent threads, irc is usually active, 2 admins, around 8 mods, regular drawthreads, most active board is /b/ by far, some activity in flash and watermellon, start a thread, you will get educated thought out responses.

==T==

===TF2Chan===
[[Image:TF2chan godhand edit.png|thumb|A typical (glorified) fangirl visit to TF2chan.]]
[http://tf2chan.net/ They have since relocated] Notable only for the huge drama that can be gained from it, due to the fact that everyone on the entire board will lose their shit the second any debate about <s>the genderbending forum</s> <s>the color of Scout's hair</s> <i>anything</i> appears. One of the very rare chans that is almost entirely female, though none of the sort even the most desperate basement dweller would sleep with (not that you'd get anywhere unless you looked like Engineer or Spy).  The board is set up into a caste system, where Mods = Gods and even so much as a spelling error will subject you to endless harassment and probably a ban. Basically, TF2Chan is a collective of [[Trolls trolling trolls|trolls trolling other trolls]]. It should be noted to anyone who wishes to post that 90% of your personality is against the <s>unwritten</s> rules and will end in a permaban.

===This Pose!===
[[Image:Thispose.jpg|thumb|Frontpage of [http://This-Pose.tk/ This-Pose.tk].]]

===WTFur===
[http://lulz.net/furi/ WTFur] is an imageboard where furfaggotry reigns supreme. It is disturbingly similar to its equally socially unacceptable relative, [[Fchan]].

===WTFux===
[http://www.wtfux.org WTFux] is an super sekrit imageboard where [[veteran]] 4chantards used to go to bitch about how /b/ sucks and Snacks ruined it all. These days it's mostly trannies, fags, and open minded weirdos flooding an IRC channel. Noted for being the first English imageboard site to feature a cats board, [http://www.wtfux.org/cats/ /cats/]. Its most active boards are [http://www.wtfux.org/cams/ /cams/] and [http://www.wtfux.org/random/ /random/].

==='''ZeroChan'''===
[http://ZeroChan.org ZeroChan.org] is ran by an insane Mexican (spic 2 to most 7channers), Caprisun was finishing his 12th taco as part of his mid-morning snack while browsing /b/. He became angered at his lack of tacos and the poor moderation of *chans when he decided to create his own chan, thus ZeroChan was created on April 4th, 2007 with the intentions of having a chan with maximum lulz and freedom.

During this time there was little traffic to his Kusaba-based imageboard. Upon seeing this Caprisun started to throw tacos at the ceiling while yelling profanities in Spanish for at least [[over 9000]] hours before falling asleep for 96 hours before taking down ZeroChan, for several months. Until he decided at another go with his chan. This time he moved to a dedicated server owned by a friend. When he moved his ZC to Apollo he was greeted with many problems, Apache and PHP proved to be a bitch at first with both of them breaking constantly along with a piece of [[AIDS]] called Cpanel, which caused more 500 errors than the shittiest apache config ever written. He grew tired of running a chan once again, leaving it unmonitored for several months before really giving it another chance at his chan. 

On January 1st, 2008 the site was given to Necrobilly after he paid Caprisun 1 million tacos and gave him a blowjay. The site is now up and currently active, it has been a safe haven from the fail and aids that most chans bring. A new year brings new hopes for this chan, and we will all enjoy the lulz of watching it once again '''epilepticly win'''.

Also, it used to host music for [[711chan]], because 711chan is to lazy to make their own, and all the mods ban for '''no raisin''' but zerochan crashed and the faggots at 711chan were never told it's back again.<--haha n00bs

'''Don't go to ZeroChan, it's too cool for school.'''

P.S.
(Erix is a douche, who changes articles like a pussy.)
