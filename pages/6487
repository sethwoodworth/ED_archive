Poker
The ultimate test of pure athletic prowess. The main goal of this sport is to see how many [[idiot]]s can blow their life savings on the [[Internets]].  Sometimes, this results in the [[pwned]] poker player having to rob a bank.

== History ==

The Cherokee [[Indian]]s invented Poker in 1764 as a means to steal money from the White Man. After all of the Redskins were killed in the War of 1812, [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte took their stockpile of American cashito and opened the first casino. As an interesting point of fact, due to his blood oath with [[Satan]], [[Napoleon]] had to open the casino near a gate to hell. Atlantic City, NJ was born a year later. "Atlantic City" is [[French]] for "The Devil's Taint."

== How to Play ==
[[Image:Video-Strip-Poker.jpg]]

First, everyone logs onto their favorite poker [[website]] -- there are [[at least 100]] of these on the [[Internets]]. These people (usually [[college]] [[student]]s) then send all of their [[money]] to the poker sites. These sites are regulated by third world countries, so they are completely safe. If you find yourself playing poker on the [[internets]] you can be sure you have no [[websense]].

The rest of the game involves good players (sharks) betting their cash in an attempt to prove that they are the best. They are consequently beaten by [[noob]]s (fish) through so-called "lucky suckouts." The good players will typically take this opportunity to call the winning player a "Donkey." The best 16 year old poker players in the world are always beaten by the worst players.

The truly best players lose all of their money because the sites are rigged. Therefore, the more you lose, the better you are at the game.

== Trolling poker players ==

# Sit at a poker table
# Pretend to don't know the rules
# Argue with people who do
# Tell them that you played poker in Vegas with Doyle Ivey and Phil Brunson
# Call very unlucky players donks
# Whenever you fold before the flop, lean over to your neighbor and tell him "I burned those cards cause they were black"
# Splash chips
# Overbet a very small pot, show everybody 72 off and yell "SUCKERS!"
# Whenever you fold say "So, you made a royal flush again?"
# If you fold and the flop doesn't have obvious straight or flush draws look at the board and exclaim "DAMMIT AND I FOLDED POCKET ACES!"
# Watch for a missed flush draw and call the guy with a small pair; then yell "I'VE GOT THE NUTS!"
# Shuffle cards like a three year old.  That is, spread them out on the table and then re-stack them.  So long as they all stay face down, it's legit.
# Take their money and observe gargantuan amounts of lulzy [[rage]] 
# Cheat. (Guaranteed butthurt.)
(WARNING: works only if you're better/luckier than your opponents, otherwise you'll [[Your_mom|loose]] everything and make an [[ass]] of yourself like the [[sad]] [[retard]] that [[you]] are.)

== Poker as a Sport ==
Many people contend that poker is not, in fact, a sport. This has been refuted numerous times by many of the games supporters.
Poker requires great stamina; sitting in a chair for 15 hours at a time while occasionally moving your thumb can be very taxing. Occasionally, players even have to push poker chips into the center of the table; this requires a [[masturbation|highly developed forearm]].

Fortunately, since many poker players are [[fat]], disgusting slobs that spend too much time [[masturbating]] while watching repeats of "World Poker Tour" on [[television]], they are well prepared for the trials that this sport brings with it.

Actually, all of that movement is required for live poker games. These games are no longer played, as it was too much work to walk to the casinos. So forget all of that shit, because poker on the [[Internets]] is not a sport.

== Poker and the [[American]] [[Government]] ==
Due to [[Satan]]'s involvement with the construction of Atlantic City, [[Conservative]] [[Christian]]s hate poker. In 2006, the [[American]] [[Government]] attempted to outlaw wagering on the [[Internets]] unless some of that [[money]] was being used to pay for [[government]] funded projects (like fixing [[Condoleeza Rice]]'s teeth).

It was also discovered that wagering on the [[Internets]] could clog it up... since it's just a bunch of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgx-_UZZTqw tubes].

== Addiction ==
If you are addicted to poker, you need to seek professional help immediately -- because only a [[fucking]] [[moron]] is addicted to a [[world of warcraft|game]]. Go get a real addiction like [[crack]], [[hooker]]s, Tang, or being a Jehovas Witness.
Also, since Poker isn't really gambling, try being addicted to gambling - it's much easier. If you wanna test your level of addiction, read the "[http://www.777.com/articles/seven-warning-signs-of-a-gambling-addiction seven signs of gambling addiction]"
