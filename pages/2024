'''Daniel Petric''' is a dirty, zit-faced [[16-year-old boy|16-year-old]] [[Serbia]]n from [[Ohio]] who, in October 2007, decided to [[Pwn]] his parents for taking ''[[Halo|Halo 3]]'' away from him because he was addicted to it. The case came to light in January 2009, when the judge finally rejected his defense of [[Scientology|insanity]] and left him and his [[goatse|asshole]] open for [[Bubba|the maximum penalty]].

Soon after he double-[[headshot]]ted his mom and placed his dad in critical condition, Petric's relatives arrived to watch a [[soccer|football]] game together. Daniel, displaying the brilliant cunning of [[Xbox]] Live players everywhere, tried to dissuade them by calling out to them, "You shouldn't come in - mom and dad had an argument!" He would have gotten away for it too, if it wasn't for his meddling, gurgling dad who [[h4x|survived a point-blank gunshot to the head]] ([[LOLWUT]] overshield?). The family members promptly called [[911]] after hearing daddy's moans for help. His dad survived, which meant that Daniel failed to unlock the achievement for a double-kill.

Following this, Daniel made good his escape in the [[Jake Brahm|family van]]. When the police caught him, the only thing he had with him was his copy of [[fail|''Halo 3'' and a bottle of lube]]. Needless to say, he got into one little fight, and if his mom didn't get dead, she would have sent him to live with his Auntie and Uncle in [[Bel-Air]].

On June 16th, 2009, Petric was sentenced to 23 years of having his [[Bubba|asshole reshaped]].

==Daniel Petric and [[You]]==

You may have classified Daniel as a sick fuck at this point, and [[you]] are probably right. But let's not forget that Daniel Petric simply represents your [[Star Wars|dark side]]. You must remember the 5th of November (or rather, sometime in October) and consider how it applies to yourself. [[You]] are no doubt a [[basement dweller]], and [[lie|you shouldn't be judged for it]].  However, the next time your parents tell you to shut off [[Gaia Online]] and go do something with your life, think of Daniel. The next time they try to force their own form of ''Halo'' rehab on you, think of Daniel.  Don't shoot your parents in the head. Save your parents, [[an hero|shoot yourself]]. Besides, it was all just a video game in his head, Wait, no respawn?

==How To Avoid A Similar Fate==

Obviously, nobody wants to be shot in the head; it's something that very few of us strive for. So here's a list of ways to keep yourself safe from a fate similar to that of Daniel's parents:
*[[Buy a dog]]
*[[Brinks Home Security|Install an alarm]]
*Ascend the stairs from the basement and discover the outside world
*Never come between a boy and his ''Halo 3''
*Try to avoid things like ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''Camp Rock'', ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Twilight]]''
*Encourage your mistake to play ''[[Battletoads]]'' instead
*Spend some time with your miscreant offspring, you aimless [[NORP]]
*Beat the little shitheads once in a while
