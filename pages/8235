The Guardian
[[Image:Guardian page.jpg|thumb|Every day is [[Africa]] Day in ''The Guardian''! Fucking [[moralfag]]s.]]
'''''The Guardian''''' is a [[Britfag]] [[newspaper]]. Unlike [[tabloid]]s such as the ''Daily Mail'' and the ''Sun'', this one is quite [[liberal|progressive]] and is mainly read by people who are rather [[hippie|left of center]] and dogmatically approve of <s>[[libertarianism]]</s> [[liberalism]] (get it right everybody hates Matt fucking Ridley, eh Monbiot?) for all, as well as many [[college]] (aka university) students  who don't know anything about [[work|the real world]] and are thus [[gullible|taken]] by the radically all-encompassing ideas within the newspaper. It's also well known for its online website version of its paper, which features many [[boring|interesting]] [[article]]s and has a network of [[blog]]s which people with differing views regularly engage in [[flame war]]s on.

100% of British [[Wikipedia]] admins [[fact|are Guardian readers]]. Also, you can bet that by now at least one Guardian columnist has seen this very fucking page.

===History and Readership===
[[Image:Nude-hippie-chick-03.jpg|thumb|left|[[Typical]] ''Guardian'' reader on her gap year in Ecuador before returning to [[university]] to do a postgraduate course in [[bullshit|anthropology]].]]
''The Guardian'' was founded [[at least 100 years ago]], in Manchester in the north of [[England]], but [[nobody gives a fuck]]. It mainly came to our attention for being one of the most interesting online newspapers, for good or for bad (actually, both). According to [[TOW]] and our own [[original research]], it has created a new breed of stupid liberal, who believe that [[the child in Africa]] is equal to them on every level - [[moralfag|moral]]ly, [[god|spiritual]]ly and [[money|monetarily]]. This usually manifests itself in stupid, liberal [[old]] fucks who smoke [[pot]], are [[vegetarian]], participate in paganistic rituals and live in the countryside and believe in [[buttsecks|universal harmony for all]], as well as young people who have [[deep thinker|too many new ideas]] on their mind and haven't hit that stage in life where [[reality]] kicks in. On the rare occasion when these people have enough [[cash]] to part with they like to embrace [[cultural appropriation]] by drinking a fine [[alcohol|wine]] and [[nom|eating fine cuisine]] in a [[Somalia|location]] too 'exotic' for the average ''Sun'' or ''Daily Fail'' reader to visit, being hypocritical because the 'ethical living' thing ''Guardian'' readers embrace is just a [[conspiracy]] [[amirite]]?

''Guardian'' readers contrast massively with the readers of those other two types of tabloids. Whilst the average Sun reader is [[retard|thick as pigshit]] and willing to swallow whatever vile propaganda [[Rupert Murdoch]] throws at them unquestioningly, and the [[typical]] [[Concerned Mother|concerned mother]] at the ''Daily Fail'' clearly does not give a fuck about what happens to anyone except [[the English]] and their [[children]], the average ''Guardian'' reader doesn't give a fuck about people in [[her]] own country who read these other two tabloids and likely looks down condescendingly upon them whilst also experiencing much self-hatred and [[liberal guilt]] even for being a [[Max Gogarty|privileged]], modern Normano-Briton, feeling [[hate|misanthropic]] about everyone except those people who have never set foot on the island of [[Britain]] and have no ancestors who have ever set foot there either. Unlike normal tabloid readers, ''Guardian'' readers would quite likely allow criminal gangs from [[Pakistan]] and [[Nigeria]] to take over England if they had the choice, but they don't, because people with money think that this is [[batshit crazy]].

Their website's main page and their newspaper's front page general reflects [[serious business]] primarily, but is a bit more [[gay|quirky]] than the front pages of papers read by those who are taken seriously. ''The Guardian'' has pretty much been anti-[[Iraq]] war right from the start and mocks [[Dubya]] at every opportunity. There's a lot of shit to do with [[Obama]] in there as well, and the views on him in ''The Guardian'' are as mixed as his parentage. They particularly enjoy talking about [[multiculturalism]], [[homosexuality]] and other pieces of [[shit nobody cares about]].

Their [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/index.html blogs] and [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree comment is free] sections are one of the biggest havens for [[moralfag]]s to [[flame war|debate]] things with each other on the entire [[internets]]. On [[South Ossetia]] and [[Kosovo]]-related issues there are many [[communist]] sympathizers who believe that [[Putin]] is better than [[Tony Blair]] because they've never been to Russia and they don't realize that saying one [[totalitarian state]] is better than another is like saying that one [[woman]] in a [[porn]]o featuring an MFF threesome has a tighter [[anus]] than the other one. Still, it is [[awesome]] that ''The Guardian'' dislike the large number of bureaucratic [[law]]s created by <s>Tony Blair</s> [[Gordon Brown]]'s government because they don't want to see [[censorship]] or their [[pedophilia|beliefs]] being made into [[1984|thought crime]]s.

''The Guardian'' is also a pioneer of the culture of the internets, rather like [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. They are known to [[loev]] [[Anonymous]], and even stood up for [[Epic Nose Guy]] (although the ''Daily Fail'' did as well, [[lawl]]), whilst also embracing the [[unfunny]] aspects of [[chan]] culture such as [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/usa/2008/08/barack_obama_channels_rick_ast.html the Obama Rickroll] and [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/08/14/i_can_haz_lolbush.html Bush being made into a lolcat]. As a result of this [[faggotry]], they were [[goatse]]d by [[Britchan]] who ''The Guardian'' actually linked directly to, [[hogging]] bandwidth from them.

They also go into excessive detail about Wikipedia to a degree that the average ''Sun'' reader wouldn't even be able to begin to understand, even worse than [[Valleywag]]. Much of it is [http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jul/31/wikipedia critical] of TOW which we here at ED appreciate, yet since it has many different people writing for it, sometimes [[Jimbo]] is allowed to use it as a [[fellatio|mouthpiece]] for his [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jun/22/wikipedia.internet driveling bullshit], which is likely to be able to brainwash ''Guardian'' readers being the [[moralfag]]s that they are. Hell, they even [http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/mar/25/wikipedia.web20 mentioned] [[Willy on Wheels]] in ''The Guardian'', [[grawp|wonder who's gonna be next]]?

No mention of the Guardian is complete without [http://talk.guardian.co.uk GuardianTalk], an online talkboard filled to the brim with hard core trolls and the lulz that accompany them but which is slowly declining despite the fact that the banhammer there is pretty lame and their security is about as robust as the American economy. GO NOW AND TROLL!

*[http://talk.guardian.co.uk/ Guardian Talk]. Dedicated talkboard which runs on a [[hint, hint|not-very-secure]] version of [[WorldCrossing]]. Home of endless, epic political trolls by both [[conservatives]] and [[libtards]] alike about such topics as [[Freedom]]â„¢, why you hate America, and of course the ever-popular [[Palestine|Israel / Palestine]] conflict.
