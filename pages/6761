On September 10th, 2008, the day that the [[Large Hadron Collider]] was to be fired up, [[moot]] decided to unleash [[unfunny|his sense of humor]] in response to all the [[bullshit|buzz]] and speculation regarding the [[LHC]]'s [[awesome]] powers of particle smashing and its potential for the kind of world [[pwn]]age that would make Google jealous since - [[some argue]] - it has the capacity to end all life as we know it.  

This involved renaming the board <big><font color=brown>'''positron uprising'''</font></big> adding some [[harbl]] and a small clickable <font color=blue>'''fyi'''</font> link under the email/comment fields, which when clicked led you to a giant [http://www.hasthelhcdestroyedtheearth.com/ <big><big>'''NO'''</big></big>] after which he [[wordfilter|word filtered]] <s>all of the filth that was [[newfag]] and [[moralfag]] speak</s> everything on /[[b]]/ into one retarded phrase that is [[now a meme]]: '''ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH'''. This assured its place in /[[b]]/'s (and all of [[chan]]dom's) history as the most blatantly [[forced meme]] evar. However, it has actually been a [[PN]] meme for quite a while, making it both unfunny and [[Old meme|old]] at the same time.

To accompany the visual faggotry, m00t had some shit [[Azn]] song playing in the background with the only discernible lyrics being "ROW! ROW! FIGHT THE POWAH!"

==Lyrics==
It was later ascertained by [[weebs|experts]] that the song is [[LOL WUT|"Rap wa Kan no Tamashii da! Muri wo Toushite Douri wo Kettobasu! Ore Tachi dai Gurren Dan no Theme wo Mimi no Ana Kappo Jitte yo"]] from the ''[[Gurren Lagann|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]]'' soundtrack and [[Shit nobody cares about|that the actual lyrics are]]:

[[divide by zero|DO THE IMPOSSIBLE]]<br>
[[Shit_bricks|SEE THE INVISIBLE]]<br>
ROW! ROW!<br>
FIGHT THE POWER!

[[pedophile|TOUCH THE UNTOUCHABLE]]<br>
[[COMBO_BREAKER|BREAK THE UNBREAKABLE]]<br>
ROW! ROW!<br>
FIGHT THE POWER!

It should be noted that according to the official lyrics, it's actually "RAW! RAW! FIGHT THE POWER!" Oh, [[Japan]].

As the faggotry spread like the [[The Cancer|malignant tumor]] it is, some [[newfag]] registered m00t's gay 'slogan' as domain name (http://www.rowrowfightthepowah.com) and redirected it to some gay Britfag forums called '''sbag''' who set up [http://www.purepwnage.co.uk/sbag/viewforum.php?f=51 a 'shelter' for pissed off /b/tards].

With the constant stream of "ROW! ROW! FIGHT THE POWAH," /b/ [http://homepage.mac.com/barthold.van.acker/realbasic/ohthehumanity.jpg eventually broke] and nobody was able to post. Exiled /b/tards found a new home on the /trv/ board, where they [[Trying too hard|raped the shit out of the place]] by posting porn images, [[Sick fuck|CP]], gore, camwhores, old memes and all that shit related to traveling. /[[b]]/'s invasion of /trv/ quickly earned a 60,000 [[GET]], seen below.

/b/tards then took it upon themselves to spread their [[AIDS]], [[The Cancer|cancer]], and [[faggotry]] to /a/, /c/, /g/, /mu/, /v/, /tv/, and /x/, thus ruining 4chan even moreso than it already is.  A mod then took it upon himself to ban ONE person, and then slunk back into his mother's basement once more where he can jerk it to pictures of [[13-year-old boys]].

==Remix==
On Wednesday, September 17, there was a troll thread about moot getting V& for Palin's email account being hacked. Many lulz were had, a fox news poll was rigged.

At that same time /b/ was changed to "/b/ - DESPICABLE, SLIMY, SCUMMY." with the text "re<s>dux</s>mix" and <s>[http://static.4chan.org/flash/b/redux.mp3 this remix of ROW! ROW! FIGHT THE POWAH]</s> ('''doesn't work''')

==The New Flag For The UK==
[[image:GreatBritainBrigadeflag.gif|thumb|right|The new flag for the United Kingdom, yesterday.]]

In late 2007, ''The Daily Telegraph'' held [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1572168/The-new-face-of-Britain-Flag-poll-results.html a competition to design the new Union Jack] after a controversy caused by requests for the [[Dragon|Welsh dragon]] to be incorporated into the design. The winner was the logo of a flaming skull with the ''Gurren Lagann'' sunglasses (actually they are Kamina's, originally), on a Union Flag, which the newspaper mistook for a dragon despite the submitter stating "It's about doing the impossible and fighting the power." [[partyvan.info]] later chose this as its logo.
