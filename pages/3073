All of freedom74's posts are long [[Communism|Marxist]] diatribes about [[The Man]]'s exploitation of the [[fag|underclasses]] that prevents him from getting a job. Many [[lie|otherwise worthwhile]] threads have been ruined by freedom74 somehow linking the original topic with his own oppression by society, inevitably derailing the thread into a [[flamewar]] until everyone gets bored or the thread gets locked.

Many people wonder why he posts on ITM at all, since he has only once ever [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showpost.php?p=391281364 made a post that had anything to do with music], and even then it wasn't relevant to ITM since it wasn't [[techno|electronic music]]. freedom74 was long assumed to be an elaborate [[troll]], until court documents showed that he seems to be a real person. Despite all his shit posts, he has not been [[permabanned]], while others have been [[banned]] for trolling him, from which some have hypothesised that he is fucking one of the [[moderator]]s.

==Background==
[[Image:Freedom74 diagram.png|thumb|right|Cycle of lulz]]
freedom74's main claim of persecution is that people are prejudiced against him because he wants a doctor to cut off his dick and make him a woman. In general most ITMers don't care about his sexuality or gender identity, and some of his harshest critics are [[fag]]s themselves, but given his other behaviour it makes the easiest angle for trolling him. This has sparked several debates amongst the other forumers, with some arguing that, given the amount of other crazy shit, there's no need to make fun of his sexuality. Despite this, many still refer to him as "he" or even "it" rather than "she". This only serves to strengthen his persecution complex, however, making him even worse.

He also uses this persecution complex to [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=227064 justify not looking for work], taking it as a foregone conclusion that nobody would employ him when in reality he hasn't even tried and is just [[too lazy]] to work. In [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?p=391912008#post391912008 a thread entitled "What jobs couldn't you do?"] he posted:{{quote|<small><small>Anything involving

{{quote|Of all the stuff I've tried, I have fondest memories of powdered rock heroin. However, I wacked from day one. It blew me right away.|freedom74}}
This of course has been siezed on by other ITMers as more material for trolling him; since as [[raver]]s they look down on any [[drug]] that isn't ecstasy, ketamine or GHB.

The hotmail address linked on his [http://www.inthemix.com.au/profile/freedom74 ITM profile] was also [[internet stalking|linked to]] posts by "Australiagirl" on the [[usenet|newsgroup]] [http://profile.nntp2http.com/e0881006971b6779a11c7d6586103973.html alt.drugs.hard]

freedom74 has since also taken to [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=228890 blaming immigrants] for his continued unemployment.
{{quote|Translated:

Immigration is bad for the environment because they'll come here, make money, build big wog palaces and drive around in fully sick gas guzzling wogmobiles.

It would be much better for the environment making them stay in the third world and keeping them too poor to afford modern technology. A wasteful life of luxury should be the sole preserve of white Anglo Saxons because we're just better than those shifty darkies.|SpaceMonkey}}
While some debate flowed on the merits of accepting immigrant laborers, the other forumers were unanimous in realising this had nothing to do with f74's unemployment.
{{quote|So once again we demonstrate why hard working immigrants are more worthwhile than lazy Australian welfare dependent junky scumbags.|big eddie}}

==OMG I hate my parents :(==
In March 2008 f74 posted a thread [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=219688 asking how he can find out if he was adopted], because he thinks he lacks any resemblance to his family.
{{quote|Its like I am soo different from the rest of them.|freedom74}}
He then went on to outline how unfriendly his [[parents]] had turned out towards their [[batshit insane]] son. As an example he cited "A charming example of their friendliness was our battle in the [[IM PRESSIN CHARGES|legal case]] of Wadsworth&Wadsworth[2008]" - because obviously if he ''wasn't'' adopted his parents would be ''all too happy'' to be sued in a frivolous [[legal action|lawsuit]] by their deranged offspring. ITMers [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/FMCAfam/2008/140.html looked up the ruling] on the case and were amazed at what they found.

As a 33-year-old having been estranged from his parents for years, freedom74 was trying to claim dependence and milk them for hundreds of thousands of dollars in the Federal Magistrates Court. Obviously the judge did the only logical thing and summarily dismissed the case.

The other ITMers responded with amazement at this new revelation, not only to see a new low in f74's insanity, but also to finally have confirmation that he was a real person and not a well-planned troll. (also that he had once been married, lol)
{{quote|I am actually in shock at the moment.

a) That Freedom actually exists, I was heavily in the 'is a troll' camp.<br />
b) That anyone would actually bring a lawsuit like that<br />
c) That anyone would think they could win such a suit.

104k p.a ex-tax??? and then asking for car and international travel allowances on top of that?

I'm surprised the judge didn't piss himself laughing whilst dismissing the case.

{{quote|There's strange, then there's a dude who'll take his family to court for a vulva and a volvo and cry here of all places when they lose.|N4TE}}
This was also the closest freedom74 came to being banned from ITM.
{{quote|You're an adult. Start acting like one. I'm inclined to ban you, not for censorship reasons, not because I'm discriminating against you because you're transexual, but because YOU'RE FUCKING MENTAL.|MadMike}}
freedom74 then announced that he planned to ''appeal a case that had been summarily dismissed''.
{{quote|you do realise the judge wrote 52 paragraphs pointing out exactly why this was a complete waste of his time and that the application was "Hopeless" in his own words.|atrev2much}}

==Family Court Appeal==
[[Image:Freedom74 key.jpg|thumb|right|Thread is now about f74.]]
Months passed without updates on his appeal, until in October [http://www.theage.com.au/national/bid-to-get-parents-to-pay-for-gender-change-hopeless-20081017-53ap.html his story broke] in the [[old media]].

Many on ITM were [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=235942 speechless].
{{quote|I just realised f74 is more famous than me.|airconteka}}
Not only was the case once again dismissed, freedom74 was also ordered to pay A$3,500 of his parents' court costs. For extra [[lulz]], the newspaper article referred to f74 as a man, despite all the court documents respectfully referring to him as a woman.

==Credit card debt==
On top of that, freedom74 is, or was until recently, also [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=175117 on the run from credit card companies] for non-payment of a $20,000 debt.

==Reaction by other forumers==
[[Image:Freedom74 hijack.jpg|thumb|right]]
[[Image:Freedom74 derailed.jpg|thumb|right]]
Not content with laughing at his stupid posts and continuing to milk him like the [[lol-cow]] he is, various forumers have at different times gotten fed up with his shit and created [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=219721 several] [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=222057 different] [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=233456 threads] petitioning for him to be permabanned. The moderators have so far not given in to these requests, instead usually locking these threads (at least two more are known to have been deleted) as well as occasionally banning other users who troll freedom74 instead.

It's bad enough when freedom74 starts a thread of his own, but it's when he posts in other people's threads, turning a previously [[lie|meaningful discussion]] around to talk about how persecuted he is, that generates the most [[anger|rage]]. When this happens, there is never any possibility of it returning to the original discussion, instead descending into a [[flamewar]], or simply with people spamming "THREAD IS NOW ABOUT F74"
