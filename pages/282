{{Subpage|Aeverine Nieves}}

A visitor to Nieves' pathetic Wikipedia ripoff site, posing as an ED administrator, made him/her answer some embarrassing questions with the promise of removing this article. <s>Some people are just too stupid to laugh at, sometimes.</s> Here it is, simply for teh lulz:

#What is the real reason you are transitioning to female?
#:The reason I am transitioning from male to female is a number of things--my mother's death and I had more female friends than male friends when I was in school. 
#What is the purpose of fantasy TV? Why do you do it?
#:If you have heard of [http://www.fantasytvamerica.com Fantasy TV America] or INFT, you would know.
#It is a well known fact that a person must undergo a mental evaluation in order to get the go ahead for sex reassignment surgery. Is this affecting your transition?
#:I am already undergoing that process. 
#You claim to have had multiple spouses in the past who are female. Conversations with former classmates reveal that you were in no way shape or form trying to be a woman. You have stated in the past that your mother told you she wanted a girl. Is this the true reason you wish to be a woman, to satisfy your dead mother? 
#:The first three did not result in a marriage. The former classmates of mine were shocked that I am transitioning from male to female. I have (personally) notified about 25% of the Mississinewa Class of 2001--I'll double check my numbers later.
#You often talk of spouses, best friends, coworkers, etc. Can you produce REAL pictures of these people? 
#:I do, but I don't have their permission to do that. 
#Do you receive any form of government assistance, trust funds, etc and are your finances handled by a court appointed individual who is responsible for paying your bills, distributing funds to you, etc?
#:No. <s><b>prolly a lie</b> <b>It is, she once posted promotional materials for a "undercover investigation" she was doing into Representative Payees (IIRC, she thought hers was stealing money from her)</b></s> <b>And [http://aeverinesblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/more-bad-news.html confirmed].</b>
#You claim your dog "Rags" is nine years old. This is very uncommon for dogs to live this long. Is this the true age of your dog?
#:Yes.
#Have you ever had a job in your life?
#:Other than NO SIR GIFTS, no.
#How do you plan on paying for your sex change operation?
#:One thing I will NOT do as far as paying for the operation is robbing a bank.
#Do you suffer from Asperger's Syndrome or any other form of autism? 
#:As a kid, yes. But I can say that I've been cured, other than being emotionally disabled. I don't think that it should affect my transition at all.
#You clearly plagiarize from many sources. A few of those are: wikipedia, the Andrea James website, hhgregg website, King of the Hill episode guides, Futurama episode guides, Beavis and Butt-Head episode guides. Why do you feel the need to steal other peoples' work and try to pass it off as your own?
#:How dare you accuse me of plagiarism from sources. The information is just coincidental, and try to work with the information in question. It is not plagiarism. I cannot explain it any clearer than that.
#What is the real reason you expelled from Indiana Wesleyan University?
#:I had a nervous breakdown at the university and unable to adapt to the college life.
