Internet commentators have been fast to weigh in on the matter of her authenticity as a true observer. A cursory glance around the tubes for more of her work bears all the hallmarks of a grade A crank: [[rave|neon colors]], [[ALLCAPS]], [[grammar|inconsistent formatting]], wild jumps between having the spelling skills of a professor and that of a [[16 year old girl]]...

Frankly, it's perfect.

In later other videos, she takes us on a wild voyage of discovery through her unhinged mind. In one video drowns a bug and records how she's been drowning it for days and it's still alive. In another she just stares directly at the sun through the camera and mutters about how maybe the pretty colored lights are things burning up.
