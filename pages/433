An hero
''<br>''Not to be confused with [[Suicide]]''.''
<i>See also: [[Mitchell Henderson]]. He was a inspiration.</i>

There comes a time in every man's life when situations spiral out of control and he finds his back against a wall. Maybe somebody [[Mitchell Henderson|stole his iPod]]. Maybe he just [[Chris Benoit|killed his wife and kids]]. Maybe he looked in the mirror and saw a [[You|Fucktard]]. Maybe you can't live with the fact that you're a [[David Carradine|washed-up actor who's addicted to sex with Thai ladyboys]].  Whatever the reason, you can either get up and face the [[butthurt|music]], or you can tell the world and whatever deity you believe in to fuck off. In the latter case, pull out your list of [[final solution]]s and place a check in the [[suicide]] [[boxxy|box]], because [[TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL|tonight, you dine in hell]].

Simply [[suicide|pwning oneself]] [[IRL]] is no cause to become '''"''An Hero''"'''. Without exceptions, '''"''An Heroes''"''' are made, not born. When [[everyone|otherwise normal and rational people]] fondly eulogize and honor those that have killed themselves before them, that's when '''"''An Hero''"''' is made. Like it or not, somebody out there probably gives a [[shit]] about Kurt Cobain. Could anyone say the same about [[you]]? That's why you'll never amount to anything. You'll never be '''"''An Hero''"'''. Don't let us stop you from trying, though. Having said that, becoming an hero is [[shit]] because you won't get to see the results of your [[suicide|successful endeavors]]. However, if you do a [[school shooting]] and don't kill yourself, you just might. With a lot of luck. Don't expect not to get raped and murdered in prison, or executed in the electric [[chair]]. There is no half/almost/soon An Hero. Either you blow your brains out and become An Hero or don't, but in your case, please do.

The phrase "An Hero" dates back to [[2006]], in reference to the prototypical An Hero, [[Mitchell Henderson]], who famously shot himself after losing his iPod. /b/tards jumped on a [[A and an|grammatical error]] made by many of his [[MySpace]] [[hugbox|friends]], and it is now immortalized as the banner under which we mock those courteous enough to [[Darwin Awards|remove themselves from the gene pool]]. Since then, an heroes of all ages have bravely been removing themselves from the gene pool, including [http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/11964366.html 3 year olds].

== You and Your Potential An Hero ==
[[Image:Candyjunkie 2008-11-22 daily news.jpg|thumb|When you become an hero, you make front pages!1]]
[[Image:Budd Dwyer NES.jpg|thumb|Inspiring an heroes since 1987.]]
[[You]] hate life. [[No one likes you|You have no friends]]. Your dad is an [[alcoholic]]. [[Your mom]] is a [[slut]]. School sucks. [[You]] get molested after class. [[You]] couldn't get a Wii two years ago or today. [[You]] lost your iPod, which, by the way, had terrible music on it. You're [[gay]]. [[You]] get [[lulz|bullied]]. [[Noone]] loves [[you]]. Everyone hates [[you]]. [[You]] just lost [[the game]]. [[lie|You've been thinking]] about becoming an hero for a while now, but are [[I'm so confused|not sure]]. [[shit nobody cares about|Will anyone care]]? Have you given the [[military]] a try? Will anyone remember you? No, because you're a [[sick fuck]]. Now you have to get set on changing that.

== IRL usage of ''an Hero'' prior to the 20th century [[faggotry|fagification]] of the [[Engrish]] language ==
While "an Hero" is regarded as a grammatical error by modern [[Noam Chomsky|linguists]], [[tl;dr|usage of the quantifier ''an'' before words that started with a morpheme of the pattern ''CV'' that began with an ''h'' in the onset was common usage before the <s>17th</s>20th century]]. {{tinyquote|But thou complying with thy princely wrath, hast shamed an Hero whom themselves the Gods delight to honor|Cowper's translation of Homer, circa 1790. Clearly, this implies that Mitchell Henderson is a time traveler from the 16th century who killed himself over a perceived decline in the English language.}} 

As h is often unspoken in certain British dialects, the "an" of "an hero" could be phonetically appropriate when speaking cockney:
{{tinyquote|'E's an 'ero for savin' me mum!}}

'''''A Dictionary of the English Language''''' (1824), defines the word ''heroical'' as something befitting [http://www.google.com/books?id=lqsRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA348&dq=%22an+hero%22#PPA348,M1 an hero].

'''''The Gentleman's Magazine''''' (1787) [http://www.google.com/books?id=ykwDAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA209&dq=%22an+hero%22 uses] an hero like a pro, and also includes many references to [[penis|Johnson]].

== "An Hero" ==
[[Image:Lulzycolumbine1.jpg|thumb|left|An heroes to us all!]]
[[Image:Nextanhero.jpg|thumb|left|An Hero coming soon?!]]
[[Image:YahooAnHero.jpg|thumb|left|[[unfunny|Become an hero!]]]]

{{quote|I'm not a boy, I'm just an hero, I'm not a man, I'm an hero.|[[gay|Gerard Way]] of [[My Chemical Romance|My Chemical Bromance]]}}

In spite of the obvious similarities, "an Hero" should not be confused with "[[Nigra|a Negro]]" or "[[Necrophilia|a Necro]]".

It is also an obscure [[fact]] that the song "And the Hero Will Drown" by Story of the Year was originally titled "An Hero Will Drown Himself".

[[Image:Thích Quảng Đức (1963).jpg|thumb|Greatest an hero of all time.]]

It is a little known fact that the plural of an hero is "one's heroes," its grammar based in [[British]] [[English]]. This will remain a little known fact, [[Noone cares|as nobody gives a fuck]].

== "[[An Heroine]]" ==
[[Image:Sexy an heroine.jpg|thumb|The fakest an [[Whore|heroine]] that ever was.]]
For most men, before they become "An Hero", they [[suicide|kill themselves]] in order to deliver a final "Fuck You" to the world. Male suicide is [[over 9000]] times more prevalent than female suicide, simply because a man has [[at least 100]] times as much [[Balls|testosterone]] as your average woman, and is usually possessed of a certain degree of mechanical aptitude, which women never are.

Women commit suicide for one of only two reasons. In the lesser case, they've [[death|lost]] someone they [[love]] and can't imagine [[dying alone]]. They decide to do Mother Nature and humanity [[A_Solid|a solid]] by also removing themselves from the gene pool.

In all other cases, the woman attempts [[suicide]] and fucks up, resulting in her [[fail|accidental death]]. Women are impelled to feign suicide whenever they are beset by despair. [[Attention whore|These women]] believe that people around them will support and comfort them, even if the only person from whom they're in danger is themselves. This is colloquially known as a [[Cutting|"cry for help"]]. It's too bad that [[Lesbian|women]] are what they [[Pussies|eat]] because they use "[[fail|sleeping pills]]" and need to [[trying too hard|try again]]. Maybe if they self-[[headshot]]ted like a [[Adolf Hitler|REEL MAN]], they'd be successful.

''See also:'' [[Unrealistic Expectations]] and [[Celebrity|Hollywood Martyr]]. The only female an heroes worth mentioning are [[Megan Meier]], whose suicide produced epic [[BAWWW]] all over the internets, and [[Christine Chubbuck]], a '70s news anchor who shot herself during a live newscast moments after [[did it for the lulz|making a joke]] that she was doing so in accordance with network policy to bring the viewers more [[guro|"blood and guts"]].

===[[JEWS DID WTC|Emos did Hannah Bond]]===

Those who comprise the 'emo scene', specifically [[My Chemical Romance]], were criticized by the coroner at the inquest into the death (by hanging) of a girl from Maidstone, Kent in the [[United Kingdom]] named [[Hannah Bond]]. 

Fuck her.

*On '''April 20, 571''' AD, Mohammed was born
*On April 20th, [[At least 100 years ago|1889]] [[Adolf Hitler]] was born. After causing [[Holocaust|lulz]], he became an hero.
*On April 20th, [[World War II|1945]] - [[military|The US Military]] captured Leipzig, Germany. Leipzig's mayor [[suicide|killed himself, becoming an hero]], but not before he [[Chris Benoit|killed]] his wife and child [[I_DID_IT_FOR_THE_LULZ|for the lulz]], making him pretty awesome; otherwise [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody would give a shit]] about him.
*On April 20th, 1999, [[columbine|two kids]] named Eric and Dylan decided to [[cool|shoot up their school]] [[I_DID_IT_FOR_THE_LULZ|for the lulz]]. After killing 13 people, they became an heroes.

==An Villain==
[[File:NaomiMisoraAnHero.png|thumb|With the help of a [[Death Note|magic notebook]], this woman became an hero. The an villain who had the same notebook made this happen.]]
Sometimes an heroes need a gentle nudge in the right direction, this is why "an villains" exist. By committing some serious [[IRL]] trolling, you too can drive that wannabe an hero to achieve his/her full potential. Good examples of an villains include [[Gary Oak]] (the Ash you see nowadays is a different one, [[srsly]]), [[Jesus]] and Bowser. Be warned that even though being an villain is a kind and noble act, many do not see it this way. Many will try to hurt, kill, rape or even troll you (it's like the goatse man getting goatsed). Be sure to always pack some heat and carry a razor blade; an villains can turn into an heroes too.

==An Sidekick==
Sometimes a person's motivation for becoming an hero is the very thing that prevents them from doing so; due to [[AIDS|sickness]], [[Christopher Reeve|paralysis]], [[Josef Fritzl|incarceration]] or even [[Stephen Hawking|mental retardation]]. In this case they may need to recruit an sidekick to [[Murder|assist]] them in their [[Suicide|endeavour]], usually a close [[Friends list|friend]], [[Daddy|family member]], or [[Troll|helpful doctor]].

==SecondhANd HERO==
[[Copypasta]] from [[TOW]]:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Svidersky Anna Esther Svidersky] (April 26, 1988 – April 20, 2006) was a [[16_year_old_girl|teenager]] who lived in the [[canada|U.S.]] city of Vancouver, Washington, and was [[pwn|murdered]] while working in a [[McDonald's]] restaurant, by schizophrenic sex offender David Barton Sullivan. [[fox|News]] of her [[death]] quickly spread worldwide, initially through the [[Internet]] friends site [[MySpace]], where she had a [[attention_whore|personal page]], and then through other [[ED|similar sites]].

== An Heroes Song ==

[[Image:Scorpio.png|thumb|right|Scorpios were born to An Hero.]]
(To the tune of "Heroes" by David Bowie.)

''I-I wish I could find''

''Find my iPod-Nano 16 gig''

''Though nothing-nothing will keep us together''

''I can't find it-I've lost it forever''

''Oh I'll be an hero-on 'An Hero Day'''

''We-we've been playing''

''Playing-playing some 'Doom'''

''And Manson he told us to slay''

''Oh let's be an heroes-on 'An Hero Day'''

''We can PWN them-on 'An Hero Day'''

''I-I went on Bebo''

''I saw-BSC''

''And in Wales-and found me a tree''

''Tied my rope-put my neck through the hoop''

''But before-told 'The Sun' bout me''

''I stood on the stool-kicked it from beneath me''

''Oh I'll be an hero-cos Bridgend is shit''

''Let's be an heroes (3X)''

''On 'An Hero Day'''

''Let's be an heroes''

''We're dying, and dying by ourselves''

''We need attention, oh put me on 4chan''

''Oh, on 'An Hero Day'''

==The "An Hero" Paradox==
[[Image:Wlkyanhero.jpg|thumb|right|Even the liberal [[media]] wants you to become an hero.]]

Scientists have theorized about what is known as the "An Hero" paradox.  In order for such a paradox to take place, two people with [[iPod]]s must steal each other's [[iPod]].  The obligation to become an hero would conflict with the gain of an [[iPod]], most likely producing the same results as [[Divide by zero|dividing by zero]].

Scientists resolved the problem by confirming that anyone who owns an [[iPod]] should become an hero immediately due to the intense [[fail]] of [[iPod]]s. The only problem with this is that only [[emo]] [[faggots]] use [[iPod]]s. And [[you]] should know that emos never kill themselves (sadly).

==Japanese East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere An Hero==

Yukio Mishima, Japan's leading [[Faggot|Cocksman]], achieved the highest score playing seppuku on his [[Nintendo]] Color TV Game. For his achievements, The Japanese Self Defense Forces gave him a high-five and a pat on the back for good measure, but secretly they laughed at him behind his back. Mishima saw a printed [[AIM]] CONVO of their giggling and was transformed into a mighty Showa [[Emo]]fag. He knew that something had to be done immediately, so he went inside and had one of his pretty young men behead him after he disemboweled himself.

[[Shit nobody cares about|In this movie, an unknown source releases a chemical that causes]] entire populations of [[retards|people]] to [[Suicide|self-pwn]] and become an heroes. As a matter of fact, the only people in the movie who do not become an heroes are the main characters, as if this wasn't a drawn-out horror movie [[meme|cliché]]. [[TL;DR|As the movie does not explain the cause, watching it is a huge waste of time for anybody]].

[[faggotry|Actually, the 'unknown source' was a bunch of freaking trees. Angry, vengeful trees. Never before in a movie have there been so many stock shots of wind blowing ominously through foliage, and never before have so many enviro-Nazis simultaneously wet themselves.]]
