Godmoding
Godmoding is the method by which the a person becomes '''King of the [[Basement-dweller]]s'''.

==History==
[[Image:Goku_wins.jpg|thumb|right|Goku powers up to win the game.]]
Godmoding was invented by [[God]].  It was first used to describe his self-insertion into his [[evolution]] [[fanfic]], where he replaced nature with himself.  [[Self-insert]]ion, subsequently, was invented by God at the same time and he's been doing it ever since.

Godmoding was then popularized by the mega-successful [[Dragonball Z]] television series.  Whenever any character in that show feels threatened, he can power up and win the game.  Godmoding on the [[internets]] is just like Dragonball Z.

== Basic Godmoding ==
Godmoding is simple.  When inside any [[role-playing]] community, send the following message:
:* ''*Darth Sephiroth casts magic missle and everyone dies* [[lol]]''

== Intermediate Godmoding ==
Roleplayers who are more experienced prefer more [[drama]] in their games. 
:* ''*Darth [[Sephiroth]] enters the room.  He is dressed in lots of black and wears sunglasses forged from the smelly underworld of [[Noxal]]*''
:* ''*Darth Sephiroth casts magic missle and everyone dies* [[rofl]]''

== Advanced Godmoding ==
[[Bullshit|True roleplayers understand the complex natures of human relationships]].  Godmoders capitalize on these [[fag]]s by emulating them for cyber-[[poon]].
:* ''*Darth [[Sephiroth]] enters the room.  He is dressed in lots of black and wears sunglasses forged from the smelly underworld of [[Noxal]]*''
:* '''Darth Sephiroth:''' ne ladiez here
:* ''*[[Hotard]]u [[yaoi]]slut giggles*
:* <Darth Sephiroth has exited to private room Love_Den>
:* <Hotardu Yaoislut has exited to private room Love_Den>
:* <Darth Sephiroth has entered>
:* ''*Darth Sephiroth casts magic missle and everyone dies* [[lollercaust]]''


''"Well fuck you guys, i wasnt trying to control people and dont say im overpowering people when kevin has fucking dragon skin armo which can stand a grenade point blank not to mention what kind of updates it has been given."''
