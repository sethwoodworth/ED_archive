'''marshviperX''' !uKc.KnUlaI '''(marshviperX#ubermicro)''' is the [[tripcode]] coined by some [[13 year old boy|underage B& faggot skiddie]] on [[g|/g/]] which was subsequently cracked by #/g/tv on irc.[[irc|rizon]].net and then used by several [[troll]]s including a [[win|prolific serial ban evader]] until the trip began resulting in a [[Ban|14-day instaban]] on January 18th 2010.

==MarshviperX Pasta==
Anonymous first posted the following [[copypasta]] on /g/ some time before summer 2009, as a sort of joke about [[botnet]]s and a way to generally harass [[newfag]]s. [http://www.rizon.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=3533 Some idiot even fell for it]

'''You talk so much about programming, but you cant talk about hacking because you cant actually do anything. I run a hacked network of computers that I programmed to click on googles ads in my secret website. I even write my own viruses to make people get hacked into my network. I work at home and have a bunch of screens showing me what people on my network are doing on their screens. I can even set it so that i can see the code of their computers. can you guys do any of that? I dont think so. I bet you dont know where all the websites real hackers hang out are either? if you name them, I just might tell them that marshviperX sent you.'''

==Birth of '''marshviperX#ubermicro'''==
In late 2009 some faggot skiddie who is a member of [[retard|hackforums]] stumbled across the copypasta and thought it would be a [[no|brilliant idea]] to post on /g/ as the famous (fictional) [[haxor]]. [[retard|Not knowing how to work trip explorer]], he picked #ubermicro as a tripcode, which translates into !uKc.KnUlaI.
With his new tripcode, '''marshviperX''' !uKc.KnUlaI quickly began [[fag]]ging up /g/ with his [[skiddie]] antics, including starting a hoax about hacking [[Runescape]] on New Years 2010. [http://forums.zybez.net/topic/1335521-marshviperx-controversy/ Sauce]
Right around the same time, marshviperX's trip was leaked on #/g/tv and several tripfags, and even some Anons began using '''marshviperX'''#ubermicro as their name while posting on /g/.

==A Tale of two Trolls==
Right around the same time, a second, and far less famous troll was making his mark on /g/, but purely for the lulz, instead skiddie fame. '''Bill Foster of 4chan with a Dynamic !IP..jhp/FQ''' (named after the [[Engineer]] turned batshit insane serial killer from the movie Falling Down), a [[Verizon FiOS]] subscriber from [[Washington, DC]], began dumping ungodly amounts of [[/s/|softcore porn]] on /g/ and [[lol wut|evading an average of a half dozen bans per night.]] He claimed he was doing this to [[lie|protest the lack of moderation on /g/]], but [[some argue]] he [[did it for the lulz]]. Finally some [[faggot|white knight]] [[Lie|"called" his ISP]] to [[internet lawsuit|report his chronic trolling]] and lulz ensued. '''Bill Foster''' got [[troll's remorse]], posted his trip, and seemed to melt back into the sea of ATI vs Nvidia shitposting normally present on /g/.

By January 14th '''marshviperX'''#ubermicro had become a fairly [[serious business|serious problem]] for /g/, with a good 15% of all posters using the tripcode and generally trolling and/or fagging things up while doing so.

That is when something snapped in Bill Foster's head again, and he went on one of the [[lulz|larger rampages in 4chan history]] using the '''marshviperX'''#ubermicro tripcode.

==The Rampage==
In the wee hours of January 14th, Bill Foster assumed the marshviperX tripcode and promptly '''[[win|dumped softcore porn in all 26 worksafe boards on 4chan.]]''' Due to the time of night, it took nearly an hour before the [[mods]] responded and [[banned|permabanned]] his ass. He promptly hit that [[penis|magical modem reset button]], cleared his cookies, and came back for more, racking up [[truth|a total of a dozen bans in just a few hours]] over the early morning of January 14th. In the process he chronically trolled [[irc|#4chan and #/g/tv on rizon]], resulting in all Verizon FiOS subscribers from the [[Washington, DC]] area being banned from both channels.
The next night he came back again, as always posting dozens of pictures of [[Hot|Metart model Demi A]], while taunting the moderators over their [[lol|ineffective ban system]]. At the suggestion of a few tripfags, he stopped "[[porn]]ing" /g/ and heavily focused his efforts on [[a/|/a/]], going so far as to ask /a/ if "you creepy weaboos can even work the report feature" while posting more [[porn]] than you can [[fap|stroke a dick at.]]
He also posted [[lulz|screenshots of his bans]], [[hacker|usually under five minutes after evading them]], further pissing off the [[mods]]. In one case two moderators banned him at the exact same time, a possible 4chan first (see screenshot.)
Using the tripcode #ubermicro began to result in 14 day to permabans sporadically, although never for more than a few minutes.

==Trip B&==
<s>Bill Foster (or as he became known, '''Thirty-ban FiOS-man''') finally won in the wee hours of the morning on January 18th when he began berating /a/ for having "imaginary girlfriends," all the while still posting very 3D softcore porn. /a/'s butthurt [[weaboo]] moderators finally had enough, and added a [[win|4chan-wide 14 day autoban for attemtping to post as marshviperX#ubermicro]].
Bill Foster was overjoyed, and once again melted back into the general shithole of /g/... [[rage|''only for people to start posting as marshviper#ubermicro (with no X) to get around the ban'']].</s>. TRIP IS UNBANNED DUE TO MODS BEING RETARDED! Troll the shit through /g/ and /a/ again.

==Rhyming Skills==
On January 20th 2010, marshviperX [[Applemilk1988|debuted]] on /g/ with his new epic hit single '''marshviper''' to much fan-fair and [[tripfag|tripfag's]] delight. Modeled after a song originally written by an [[emo|emo]] [[white trash|honkie]], it gives great insight into the daily shenanigans of [[g/|4chan's /g/]].

==Lulz come back==
As of May the 29th marshviperX#ubermicro no longer gives bans, trolling has now ensued and /g/ is now a shitstorm again.
Finally on April the 16th shit hit the fan and everyone on /g/ decided to troll as "[318.271.209.101]marshviperX !uKc.KnUlal" With " MarshviprX@botnet.co.uk " in the email field, the added lulz come from the fact that IP's don't go past 255 and thus 318 is an impossible IP.
On April the 16th everyone realized that marshviperX#ubermicro was no longer a tripban, thus people spammed marshviperX pasta to the point that on pages 1-15 on /g/ there were atleast 4 topics of it. [[Image:Techglol.png|thumb|Page 0 of /g/ on that day, pretty much EVERY page was like this for several hours.]]

Mods on #4chan were alerted but promptly ran off because they are lazy fucks. /g/ now remains in a shitstormed state with trolling and butthurt rampart.
