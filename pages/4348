As well as being another word for [[boring]], a '''job''' is something that [[Niggers|unemployed people]] and [[student]]s don't have. Jobs are, by definition, paid labor. Anything a [[robot]] could do better, a [[human]] is already doing and getting paid to -- unless they are [[Mexican]], as paying a Mexican is [[PROTIP|purely optional]]. Why don't blacks like [[blowjobs]]? It's a job.

== How to Get a Job ==
[[Image:Ashmaid.png|thumb|[[Pok√©mon|Ash Ketchup]] can get a job and [[lie|so can you]].]]
# Ask [[Mom]]my or [[Dad]]dy to get you connections
# ????
# <s>Profit!</s>

If that doesn't help, open up those "[[Old media|want-ads]]" your pop talks about (or alternatively, [[Craigslist|a new browser window]]) and start circling interesting [[ads]]. After an hour, [[THEN WHO WAS X|pick up a phone]] and start calling around, making appointments for interviews. Eventually, you will find some paid task to occupy your [[attention]] for 8 hours every day!

== Some Advantages of Having a Job ==

* You get some [[money]] - After [[the man|the Government]] takes its cut for [[tax]]es.
* You might meet [[prostitute|people]] you can have [[sex]] with - Take special care to avoid coworkers and professional contacts, as this may lead to a sexual harassment [[lolsuit]].
* Free [[coffee]], if you work as a [[pilot]], at a hotel or a [[Starbucks]].
* See that pen over there? [[Theft|Take it]].
* No [[seriously]], take it. There's a shitload of them in the supply closet. Go load your bag up with as much as you want. Paper is always complimentary.
* Here, have a company [[car]] too. Sure it's just a Taurus, but in a few years it could be a BMW!
* Get promoted to [[Darth Cheney|Senior VP]] of [[Fails|Sales]] and make more money than [[God]]
* Some people will cruelly call you 'a [[loser]]' just should you not have a job; getting a job will prove that you are, rather, 'a [[luser]] with a job', with all the [[Semen|humiliation]]-guzzling [[Skillz|sqiLlz]] that implies.

And remember, after your teeth have been knocked in and the hundredth or so [[Bubba|boss]] has had his way with your asshole, you won't feel a thing---and the company [[Dental Plan|insurance plan]] might pay for as much as 30% of your ostomy and [[George Washington|false-teeth]] supplies!

== Some Disadvantages of Having a Job ==
* Less time to play on the [[internets]], unless you work in an office and have a computer to yourself
* Too much [[RL]] [[drama]], from coworkers and friends who don't see you often enough
* More opportunity for your head to explode; workplace tension is among the worst
* Most [[Walmart|jobs]] don't offer paid time off, vacation or holiday breaks; will expect you to work "overtime" and [[Illegal|during breaks mandated by law]]
* [[Drug]] testing is mandatory; [[pot]]heads need not apply
* Having to clean your desk out once you get fired for looking at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] while working
* Security escorting you out of the building by your collar
* Being thrown into a parking lot after being fired
* [[Unemployed|Going back to finding a new job]]

There are many different kind of jobs. It's important to pick the right one that suits your personality.
