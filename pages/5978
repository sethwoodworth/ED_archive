[[Image:Pedobear.png|right|thumb|Oldwindybear once resembled [[pedobear]]]]
'''Oldwindybear''' (AKA John1951, AKA JohninMaryland) was a Wikipedia admin, who [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=146966068 quit] after it was found out he abused [[sock puppet]]s, including nominating himself for adminship because [[No one likes you|no one else liked him]].

==Some Background==
He joined [[Wikipedia]] back in 2005, and started his [[Anti-Americanism|Liberal whining]] shortly thereafter.  Later on, he logged onto his friend's computer at work, and started editing with another account.  

==He got Caught, Biatch!==
He got caught when Timothy Usher's sock puppet [[Proabivouac]] took way too much time [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Proabivouac/Oldwindybear%26Stillstudying digging up evidence]. Lol, caught sockpuppeteer caught by a sock puppet. He later decided to quit, and spend time raping his grandsons.

===What others think===
*OK, in that case I am going to block your account as that of a confirmed sockpuppeteer and ask for a steward to remove the admin bit from it. [[Wikipedia:User:Theresa Knott|Theresa Knott]] | [[Wikipedia:User talk:Theresa Knott|The otter sank]] 10:04, 25 July 2007 (UTC)[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AProabivouac%2FOldwindybear%26Stillstudying&diff=146999064&oldid=146996581]

*OWB/SS has also grossly abused Mytwocents in [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Oldwindybear|Suspected sock puppets/Oldwindybear]] ... I'm not sure why more attention was not given to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Stillstudying&diff=prev&oldid=51910411 OWB's bizarre creation of SS's talkpage], noted by Mytwocents. I must say I agree with all Barneca's 'rant' and am surprised, given all this, that there is any support for OWB (or any of his clones) ever being welcome back in any capacity. (There was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=145021469 an email] sent by OWB to Jonashart 'from work' earlier this month - might that reveal an i.p. address in its headers?)

*So what exactly do you intend to do with all this evindence? OWB has semingly left Wikipedia, but I beleive with this evidence you can get him blocked for being a MeatPuppeteer. --[[User:Atomic Religione|<font face="Papyrus" font color="purple" font size="1">ÄtΘmic</font>]][[Wikipedia:User_talk:Atomic Religione|<font face="Papyrus" font color="red" font size="1">R€£igione</font>]][[Wikipedia:User:Atomic Religione/Autograph book|<font face="Papyrus" font color="black" font size="1"><sup>sїgñ</sup></font>]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AProabivouac%2FOldwindybear%26Stillstudying&diff=147056281&oldid=147055392]

*This is pretty big considering Wikipedia puts a crap load of trust in their administrators, and denouncing that there are any corrupt admins. Well I guess we found one. --[[Wikipedia:User:Atomic Religione]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Proabivouac/Oldwindybear%26Stillstudying&diff=prev&oldid=147061794]

*I want to thank you for both your time spent working on this, I thought I had discovered this a while back, certain posting styles/times of account usage jumped out at me, but I didn't believe I would be able to put anything this elaborate together, this is more detailed and damning then anything I could have managed.

==The Return==
He came back a few weeks later as John1951, since his grandkids were tired of [[buttsecks]].  He decided to leave when he found some new [[jailbait]] to [[rape|play with]]. That's not candy in his van kids.  This account was revealed by [[user:Sasha Callahan|Sasha Callahan]] who wanted to get blocked because she was done with being a [[wikipedo]].

==The Evidence John1951=Oldwindybear==
It's a fact, [[Wikipedia:user:John1951|John1951]] is the same person as [[wikipedia:user:Oldwindybear|Oldwindybear]]

Harry,
<br />
I trust you, and I do not believe you would violate that trust unless I did something to warrant such, which I do not plan to do.
<br />
I came back quietly as John1951, after talking to a crat, and others.  Feel free to monitor my postings - I posted the article I had written, but not posted, and categorized the last article I wrote, which no one had cateogrized while I was gone.  That was all I did, for now.  The extent to which I will continue editing, frankly, depends on a number of things.  I would like to quietly write articles - please let me know what you thought of the new article, at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Little_Robe_Creek
<br /> 
John

Hello,<br />
<br />
Before I say anything, I want to tell you this; I know who you are, and sure as hell you know who I am. I've known for some time now that you are the same person as NE, and you know that I was once OWB, and now use the name John1951.
<br /><br />
I appreciate you not telling anyone about my new name. A few members of [[Wikipedia:WP:MILHIST|MILHIST]] are aware of my former identity, and are willing to support a future RFA. I realize I said I wouldn't put myself into a position of power, but seeing some support for it has emboldenned me to be an admin again.
<br /><br />
I'm not asking for your support. Nor do I expect it. However, given our past-history, I'd KINDLY ask you not to participate. If you shall oppose me, it would be awfully tempting for me to tell an admin or two your past identity. And these ones won't be so hospitable to the idea of getting a new start.
<br /><br />
Best Wishes,<br />
Johnny<br />

This email wasn't posted on Wikipedia, so ED should be proud to have such exclusive evidence of fraud on Wikipedia.

==Return of the Pedo?==
On December 26, [[Wikipedia:User:JohninMaryland|JohninMaryland]] joined Wikipedia.  Now, we already know Oldwindybear's name is John.  And he lives in the Washington Metro area but really, do you have to make it [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Argos%27Dad&diff=prev&oldid=152244277 this] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Argos%27Dad&diff=prev&oldid=180316970 easy]?
