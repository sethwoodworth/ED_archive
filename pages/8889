Waluigis-girl
[[Image:An Actual ID Thingy by waluigis girl.png|thumb|Oh, the hypocrisy!]][[Image:WalG-lolwut.jpg|thumb|This statement contradicts her sig and the fact all her Waluigi [[hentai]] [http://www.hentai-foundry.com/pic-7904.html was uploaded] [http://www.hentai-foundry.com/pic-7706.html this year] ]]
[[Image:WLG is a dropkick.JPG|thumb|Waluigi is her pride. Her race is not.]]
'''Waluigis-Girl''' (also known as "Nekkonell") is a [[Typical|typically]] oversensitive [[Weeaboo|Wapanese fangirl]] and devianTARTLET who hungers deeply for the imaginary cock of Waluigi, [[Weegee|Luigi]]'s poorly named and flamingly [[gay]] evil twin -- and possibly [[Nintendo]]'s most underwhelming creation since the Virtual Boy --  thrusting down her throat and ass.  Like any good [[weeaboo|failure]] she can only communicate in [[animu]] emoticons and cannot conclude a single paragraph without including the godforsaken [[^_^]].

==Activities on deviantART==
[[Image:OC_Torture_Stamp.png‎|thumb|right|[http://waluigis-girl.deviantart.com/art/OC-Torture-Stamp-110761383/ Now that's someone who doesn't liek their own OCs.]]]
Unsurprisingly she is listed as an [[Art School|art student]], and if the traumatizing subject matter  of her "work" doesn't scar you like an obese priest does a sensitive, nubile altar boy, then the technique will. In the spirit of fellow devianTARD [[GoddessMillenia]], all her artwork appears to have been done with hand-me-down crayons.  She incessantly draws [[Nintendo]]-themed [[Bullshit|"art"]], as well as poorly-animated [[CP|Loli]] with what, after days of study, may resemble [[fat|obese]] creatures from the shallow bog of her imagination.  Considering all this, her statement that she '''"draws like she's from japan"''', pushes her level of failure to near-[[snapesnogger]] and [[ryoukitten]] levels.  P.S. She looks kinda liek [[Tay Zonday]]. 

Her art style consists of characters who have gained weight in areas of their body to the point if you saw them in real life, they'd look like they had some sort of skin disease that caused them to swell up like watermelons, which she happens to eat for dinner. The connection is astonishing yet true.

Like most [[16 year old girls|deviants]], each and every journal reads like any given [[crap|entry]] taken from the MySpace of a public high school student (although she openly frowns upon MySpace users in her journal, because losers are never to be found in mass droves on deviantART). Thus, at any given time, you may have the reading pleasure of delightful, [[LOL WUT|sublime]] musings from her answers to a quiz ''[http://waluigis-girl.deviantart.com/journal/ seventy questions long]'', wherein she further demonstrates her immense naiveté by stating that she often eats at "Kiki's.  High quality Japanese food at a very affordable price. w00t!".  Because if anybody knows high-quality Japanese cuisine, it's a Midwestern weeaboo.

Much like all other demented [[fangirls]], Waluigis-girl is not the exception to the rule: Fangirl + deviantART = Club for fangirls

Or in her case: [http://anti-waluigixdaisy.deviantart.com/ hate club]

She shows [[lulz|daring and passion]] in creating her own hate club for Daisy x Waluigi, and called for [[idiots|recruits]] to join her cause. Just when we thought she couldn't [[fail]] any more.

You do that [[fangirl|girlfriend]]. You do that.

==Fangirlism==
[[Image:Anti_WxD.jpg |thumb|left|Do the exact opposite of what this stamp says, if only to piss her off.]][[Image:WalG-shirt.jpg|thumb|Oh god. She actually [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/38301777/ wore that shirt in public]]][[Image:What_s_My_Name_by_waluigis_girl.jpg|thumb|Waluigi apparently has the amazing power to fire his own name from his [[penis|crotch]]]][[Image:Walueegee.png|thumb|[[weegee|wat]]]][[Image:WalG-onfangirls.jpg|thumb|Waluigis-Girl bitches about crazy obsessive [[fangirl]]s who are in love with video game characters. Wait what?]][[Image:Cameraplacement.JPG|thumb|Waluigis-Girl dispenses some priceless advice]][[Image:WalG-horrifyingjournals.jpg|thumb|Her DeviantART journals may be short, but they don't lack some truly [[lulz|horrifying statements]]]]
Like every single other [[loser|lulser]] on the [[internet]] in love with a fictional character, Wuluigis-Girl has created a [[Mary-Sue]] to [[fuck|win the heart of]] the character she obsesses over. In a bout of self-hatred her Sue is [[white]], who, in a fit of astonishing creativity, she named "Neko".

Waluigis-Girl clearly suffers from [[Bishie syndrome]] as she coats a thick [[bishounen]] veneer over Waluigi every time she "draws" him, despite the fact Waluigi himself is [[fugly|aesthetically lacking]] and barely resembles anything "human". Sadly, due to Waluigis-Girl's [[suck|skill level]], this doesn't make him look attractive so much as it makes him look like a small child with [[FAS|Downs Syndrome]], and what's ''supposed'' to be his mustache resemble something akin to big black spikes jutting awkwardly from his face.

Her [[sick fuck|twisted]], demented, and utterly slavish devotion to this entirely token [[Mario|Super Mario]] character is horrific on such a level as to cause [[anonymous]] to prefer viewing [[The Power 5]] in an endless, droning PowerPoint presentation instead. Additionally, according to her, if [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/56205316/ this isn't the sexiest piece of ass in fucking creation] (Baleeted) to you, you are ''obviously'' a [[troll]]. 

Amongst the most powerful methods of trolling her, promotion of the [[ship|WaluigiXDaisy fandom]] on her deviantART, LJ and YouTube pages is tried, and true. She possesses [http://s4.photobucket.com/albums/y126/nekkonell/?action=view&current=antiWxD_evidence.flv startling video evidence against WaluigiXDaisy].

Well, well.  I like to masturbate, myself.  But not to the shit you look at.
[[Image:Twelve_by_waluigis_girl.jpg|thumb|right|It's only ok when she does it.]]
{{quote|<small><small>Okay, seriously. I can still remember this goddamn fanfiction I read about 5 years ago that involved a Waluigi x Plum pairing and I STILL find the idea extremely disturbing. Plum is a goddamn preteen, and Waluigi's in his late 20s. I know Waluigi's ultra-crazy... but he is NOT into freakin' lolicon with a 12-year-old golfer. <b>And it doesn't matter that her age was increased to make her 'legal', her official age is still 12.

Well, let's see.  Waluigi is an autistic flaming homosexual.  And Plum? FUCK YEAH, I hit that.

{{Quote|<small>Here's a little question for the Waluigi fangirls. How do you feel about Waluigi being 'coupled' with anyone? (i.e. Waluigi being given a girlfriend or even a wife) Personally, I don't like it at all, and '''I think those who couple Waluigi with anyone and put it on the Internet should much rather be keeping it to themselves or not doing it at all.'''</small>|Waluigis-girl|[http://community.livejournal.com/waluigi/34158.html she should have followed her own advice]}}

Duuuuh, whaaa...?  Oh, wait.  For a second there, I thought you were asking yourself a rhetorical question, lulz.

==An [[Aspie]] Appears!==
[[Image:Waluigisgirl_Aspie.jpg|thumb|right|This is an [[Aspie]], I can tell the [[fucktard]]ed from the [[aspies]] from having seen several [[aspies]] in my time.]]

[[User:Ntg85|Ntg85]] [[Pain Series|has sworn in an affidavit]] that Waluigis-girl has [[IRL]] [[aspie|assburgers]]! Ntg, having spent quite a bit of time mentoring the [[Retard|less socially able]], identifies the following characteristics, as seen in [http://s4.photobucket.com/albums/y126/nekkonell/?action=view&current=antiWxD_evidence.flv this video]:

*Face permanently frozen in an expression of tard glee
*Obvious obsession with proving/disproving fandom minutiae
*Tone of voice demonstrating barely concealed giddiness at sharing "discoveries" with others
*Tendency to get extremely [[butthurt]] and throw fits when faced with opposing evidence
*Lack of interest in typical black person activities, such as eating [[fried chicken]] and [[Gun|busting caps]]
*Belief that anyone besides her [[Nobody Cares|gives a shit]] about her OTP, especially outside the Internets
*Wearing [[Chris-chan|clothing or accessories]] displaying aforementioned obsession outside of aforementioned internets
*Looking like [[Tay Zonday]] and sounding somewhat like him if he was on helium 24/7.
<!--Srsly, I knew this girl with IRL Asperger's who spent 100% of her time obsessing over whether Taiki Kou had a big forehead or not, and she looked and spoke ''exactly like this.''.-->

Please note that having the fictional disease does not excuse her behavior, since rtards should stay off our tubes, [[am i rite]]?

<!--lulzify the shit out of this section -Shen-->
<br><br>
Thrilling, epic, and a surprisingly moving read, [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/52865127/ her fanfiction] is a piercing view into a [[FUBAR|chronically disordered mind]] with a [[Shit|hamfisted sense of plot]], and the control over English of a four-year-old. Unfortunately, the section where Waluigi and Wario 'reward' Neko is cut, as it would just be too hot for DeviantART. 

{{quote|<small><small> The part where Waluigi and Wario 'reward' Neko is cut out for obvious reasons, because not only is it long, '''it's graphic'''.</small></small>|Waluigis-Girl|creeping us all out}}

[[Image:Drunk Waluigi.png|thumb|Waluigi, shortly after learning of his "girl."]]
'''An excerpt from this sure-to-be classic:'''
''"What, you thought I wouldn't do good? Think... AGAIN. Think a second time round." "Hey... Neko..." Waluigi smirked. "Remember when I said you'd get some perks working for us?" "But, Waluigi, I already get a third of what I take for you." "I'm talking about... more... PERSONAL perks. Let me remind you that you're a girl... and still pretty young at that." He slinked towards her. "So... what do you say? Feel like taking us on?" Neko's eyes glazed over. "Yes... yes, please..." "Oh man, she's a little excited," Wario said. "You've been with a man before?" Neko shook her head. "No, this is my first time." "Ooohh..." The brothers smirked at each other. "Is that so? This'll be a night to remember, then." Waluigi lifted her up and carried her to his bedroom, with Wario following close behind. "We'll make sure to reward you the right way for what you've done for us..." Afterwards, Neko was about to move down to the mattress, but Waluigi held her back. "You'll be sleeping here tonight." He looked at her for a while before kissing her. "We should really do this again sometimes." ''


'''Excerpt from her Utterly Obnoxious "The Saga of Faith Chapter 14"'''<br>
The next morning, Neko awoke to the sound of her cell phone. "He--hello?" "Neko... it's me." Neko's eyes widened. "You? Wha-- Waluigi?" Penjullu's ears flattened and he rolled over. "Listen, Neko, I just want to apologize for any trouble Luigi may have caused you; he doesn't know what he's talking about," Waluigi said. "I don't plan to do that at all." Neko smiled. "That's so good to hear." "Yeah, Luigi got the wrong idea because I said I didn't like having that crazy Hypno around and I felt like I had to do something about it." "Ahh..." "Don't worry, Neko. I'm gonna be coming really soon. Then you'll be happy." "Yeah... happy..." Neko sighed. "Very... very... happy..." "Listen, game time's about to start, but I just thought I'd point that out. I love you, Neko." "I love you too," Neko replied, then clicked the phone shut. "I should probably take a shower," she said. As she walked out of her bedroom, she could see Vivian lounged in an awkward position on the couch. She passed Keiko in the hallway and turned towards her. "Dude, what's Vivian doing on the couch?" Keiko smirked. "She got drunk last night. She was so pissed off that she went down to Maneki Lucky Cat and got some drinks. ...Apparently she beat the bartender so hard that he had no choice to give her a drink to make her stop." "Holy shit, she's violent," Neko muttered. "Heh heh... I'm gonna screw around with her..." She walked right next to Vivian and turned on the fake waterworks. "Vivian," she whined. "Wake up! It's all true! I've been left behind; Penjullu isn't--" "What? I'm gonna kill everyone-- OW!! My head! It's pounding!" "Hah hah! Gotcha! You got SO slammed last night!! I just HAD to screw with you for a few minutes!" Vivian groaned. "Ugh. Just... get outta here."

==Ex-Roommates Have Their Say==

User HQD solemnly swears and can verify the following facts:

*Waluigi's girl spends more time over her ship than her own hygiene
*Speaks more like a retard IRL than the video lets on. She actually TRIED to sound smart, homigah!
*Any money she got went to feed her fangirl obsession. It is believed that some of the funds were "borrowed" from her roommates
*Waluigi's girl also spent more time drooling over her own badly-drawn pr0nz to actually do any housework or improve on her art. Unfortunately, the teachers eventually gave her up as a lost, hopeless cause, and banished her back to kindergarten
*Turned a PS2 remote into a vibrator
*Unfortunately, Waluigi Girl's artwork will continue to plague teh interwebs for all eternity. She is also supposedly going back to school to "improve"

All ex-roommates who have seen this page rejoice ED.

=="Wiimote"==

That poor rodent mentioned in her journal was not only branded with such a lul-worthy name, but was neglected beyond on anything. Wiimote:

*Was starved so Waluigi's Girl could get a new pet (presumably a snake to whom she would feed Wiimote's corpse)
*Was banished to the living room to be ignored
*Had her rat food funds stolen for PS2 memory cards and Waluigi crap
*Went batshit insane due to the carelessness of her owner, and was renamed "Retard Gerbil" by the neighbors and former roomates.

HQD swears as an ex-roommate of these events.
