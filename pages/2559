'''''eRepublik''''' is an online political game that allows participants to embark on a virtual journey, helping a country of their choice e-prosper and eventually even rise as high as governing it. The game itself started in [[2007]] with just a small following, though now members have risen to nearly [[over 9000|250,000]], and recently different online communities, such as [[7chan]], [[888chan]], 4chan and [[Something Awful]] have taken to using the game as a platform to outsmart and in doing so one-up the rest of the internet. The sheer amount of [[unwarranted self importance|e-power]] one can feel from ruling a virtual country makes [http://www.erepublik.com/en erepublik.com] one of the freshest grazing grounds for srs bizness, [[internet tough guy]] lulzcows known around.

==Object of the Game==

A player will start off as a [[noob|lowly level 1]], before working their way up both monetarily and politically till such time as they are in a position to do things like [[Obama|join congress]], Jew, or begin a [[newspaper]]. Once there they can begin to change [[Dildo|things]], like encouraging the country to go to [[war]], [[Pussy|make peace with another country]], or as many have taken recently to doing, [[Rape|hijack]] and royally [[In_the_ass|buttfuck]] the entire economy. The [[Lie|fact]] that it takes so long and a lot of dedication to do any [[shit]] in [[The_game|this game]] is the reason why people [[Nerd_rage|rage]] so hard when we fuck things up.

==Raids and Drama==
[[Image:Minimum wage rape2.png|thumb|[[How do I shot web?|How does I stagnate businesses?]]]]
===eVenezuela===

Midway through [[2009]], having seen [[4chan]] /v/ complete a successful takeover of Pakistan, and Something Awful control large portions of [[Russia]], 7chan decided they would try to get in on the action; citing "[[Venezuela|SeVenezuela]]", a passionate yet smaller country full of [[spics]] as an easy target, raid leaders Wilko, Ignatio and Tietovallu set about recruiting personnel on 7chan [[b|/b/]], and setting up the raid channel [irc://irc.7chan.org/7leaves #7leaves] for co-ordination.

Needless to say, despite over 120 active members, 3 months later their attempts to take over congress and have any say in the running of the country had proven fruitless, and they were now openly mocked by the [[Hispanic]] natives. It was at this moment that Tietovallu decided it would be a good idea to recruit at the home of the [[raid|raidfags]], 888chan /i/. Within days a new raid channel was set up as an alternate base, and through the combined efforts of the two groups and the following month's congress elections 888chan won 15/40 seats, and 7chan won 9/40, meaning that between them 888chan and 7chan finally had the majority congress seats needed to pass their own laws and in doing so serve Venezuela their own brand of [[lulz|rapeage]].
[[Image:Oh noes.png|thumb|[[All Your Base Are Belong To Us|Uh oh!]]]]
Thus far, all taxes have been raided to the maximum, minimum wage raised to [[over9000]], and natives did not stop their [[baw|butthurt whining]] for weeks.

'''Total Destruction'''

When you have a wart in your toe, you don't cut the whole toe off. However, this is exactly what the president did. He basically gave the whole country to eBrazil, in order to revert our new laws of [[pwnage]], and abolish our parties and economics. Win from the native side was very scarce here. Their economics were utterly raped, a hospital that took almost an year to build and defence systems were destroyed. Not to mention the obvious: they will have to reconquer the country back and start the parties again if the wish eVenezuela to be independant once more.

Win was gained from the [[888chan]] side. Although this wiped out the [[chan]] government, it destroyed eVenezuela more than the chans could have ever done. Everything important with the economy of eVenezuela was done before it was capitulated by eBrazil.

====Kittens' Butthurt====
[[Image:Kittens 4chan.jpg|thumb|[[GTFO|Go away, Kittens]]]]
[[Image:Kittenslieksmen.png|thumb|[[Fag|The truth behind Kittens' butthurt]]]]
[[Image:Erepublik-kittens-homosexual.PNG|thumb|[[Lulzkiller|More faggotry]]]]
Kittens, one of the original [[7chan|7channers]] behind the erepublik raid, felt betrayed by 7chan’s forming of alliance with [[888chan]], and sought to upstage the raid at every opportunity possible. Having tried to [[PA]] [[4chan]] into helping him overthrow 7chan, and having bawwed several times in [irc://irc.7chan.org/7leaves #7leaves] and on 7chan [[b|/b/]] threads he now sits on SeVenezuela congress harmless, but awaiting the first chance to strike and destroy the [[raid]].

===Trolling===
[[Image:successfultroll.PNG|thumb|[[Faggot|The man himself]]]]

[irc://irc.7chan.org/7leaves #7leaves] experienced some inner trolling during Operation SeVenezuela, which some say it was the reason of it's downfall. In late July, a young chap with the stench of a troll on him joined the channel. Under the guise of a guilable shota loving Miku Hatsune fan he worked with the resident troll, [[Oldfag|poe]] at pissing off the 7channers. After the first congress elections after 7chan's arrival, the scoundrels of #7leaves managed to win a total of 15 seats in the congress, one of which was taken by Roberick. One day after the elections, he decided to leave the 7chan party and the channel, thus sparking a huge shitstorm that ruined Sevenezuela from inside. Sometime after he departed, poe and another so-called leader, Rodrigo, decided to claim that all leaders behind Sevenezuela are Croatian spies, apparently to root out the faggots. The plan backfired (or did it?), making half of the people from #7leaves abandon the operation.
It's fate was sealed with Roberick returning, thus beginning his trolling crusade and managed to succeed where Kittens failed. He claimed that he did it because of 7chan's alliance with 888chan, but in reality, he did it for the lulz. He managed to cut any support #7leaves would have from 7chan by flooding eRepublik threads with pictures of shota and convincing the [Fags|Mods] to support him. Finally, together with poe, he wiped any influence 7chan would have in eVenezuela by creating a troll newspaper, namely The Secret Gazette, where he claims that 7channers are white supremacists and all they want is to conquer eVenezuela and turn it into an English country. Unfortunately, the admins deleted his racist articles.

====Insurgen Compromised====

As a somewhat unwanted side-effect of the newfag participation in the raid, and the then-lack of robots.txt blocking [[google]] from indexing [[insurgen.info|w/i/ki]] pages, for one reason or another the relevant address of the insurgen.info page was compromised. Of course, this fail was quickly turned to win as the page was transformed into a [[gore|shock]] page and any unwitting erepublik visitors were scarred accordingly, as the forum thread was also trolled in an attempt to get the poster [[b&|banned]] for linking to such horrific content.

====7chan Faggotry====

Despite early teamwork, frictions have threatened to split the 888chan/7chan alliance from the dawn of its existence. The problems stem from the fact that this raid was initially a 7chan effort to control, not harm the country of Venezuela, but power struggles and lack of [[i|/i/nsurgent]] know-how led to their initial failure. Recruiting at 888 was seen as a last ditch effort to bring the raid back on track, and many original 7channers felt this was conflicting with their rudimentary goals and left. The 7channers who stayed underwent continuous internal power struggles and changes in direction; playing the part of the hormonal [[16 year old girl]] in the inter-chan relationship they loved 888 when 888 showed signs of bringing the success they couldn’t achieve on their own then blew them off when a new personality took charge.

Ultimately, what success the two groups had together was blown apart when those 7channers who had initially left in disdain of the new relationship with 888 came back to bask in the congress glory they had contributed nothing towards, and decided that the best way forward was severing all ties with 888.

They became known as [[7chan|ungratefulchan]].

=====Wilko's betrayal=====

A plan of getting epic win from eVenezuela was made: a plan to issue [[over 9000|over ninety thousand]] eVenezuelan currency and turn it to Jew [[Epic win|of epic win]], which is the main currency of the game. Three irl american dollars is worth five Jew. There was doubts of Wilko's trustworthiness, but as laws to issue more money and donate them to the chans' private bank passed, no one was in doubt that this would provide [[Epic win|great success]], deflating the eVenezuelan currency and leaving the chans with a huge stash of Jew.
[[Image:Feelsgooderepublik.png|thumb|Then who was [[economy]]?]]
There was no word from Wilko (who was unfortunately the only person who had access to the bank) for a few days after the money was issued and donated. Then was that some [[i/|brave /i/nsurgent]] found out that Wilko had spent all his Jew to fund his own resistance war, making him a battle hero (one of the various "achievements" in the game), and the president of eVenezuela if the resistance war would succeed.
[[Image:I will get revenge.jpg|thumb|Mexican will get [[rape|revenge]]]]
Alot of raeg was had in 888chan's IRC. No news was had from #7leaves, obviously because they followed Wilko's selfish ideals. It is alot of Jew he wasted in order to make himself [[an hero|an hero of the]][[7chan|ungratefulchan]], but this is when the fagmasters Teronism, DentalPlan and Tietovallu of the 888chan had pure optimism in their minds.

{{quote|This just proves my point: 7chan is full of cancer and aids. If four months of playing the game so srs bsns is called win by 7channers, I cannot say anything but that they are the cancer of the internet. But do not falter /i/nsurgents, eVenezuela was just a stepping stone in a much greater plan. One day we will free our Great Motherland Best Korea. We will troll eRepublik into submission.

Maybe he even boosted some little business' economy by using all his money.| Tietovallu}}

===eSouth Africa===

A country where we have friendlies that are already attempting a takeover and have a party. The whole country shat bricks when /i/nsurgents landed on the beaches of eSouth Africa, being handed effort-free citizenships.
[[Image:ERepublik-south_africa_forum.png|thumb|[[Masturbation|eSouth-Africans' forum after visit]]]]
'''eSouth Africa forums'''

One of the /i/nsurgents' covert operatives [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Troll#Famous_Trolls_.28Internet_Related.29 Exilious] found the forum. /i/nsurgents registered there and bricks were shat. Posting a simple "introduction" cause epic butthurt and baww.

Hi my name is [[Ultimate_Muscle_Roller_Legend|MuscleRoller]] and I am here with couple of my Harvad University student friends and Prof. David to test his new business schemes. He is a professor of macroeconomics.

Apparently we tested them in eVenezuela but the president got jealous and sold the country to eBrazil. It was unfortunate because I couldnt finish my economics project.

Heres my project paper:

Successful troll was successful. Rage replies and the OP himself convincing that they never did anything bad to eVenezuela and that they are here to help. The troll-defence was bad though, all they did was being srs bsns and saying that OP is obvious. No shit.

They continue to call /i/nsurgents PTO'ers (PTO = political takeover), it's just a game man. Its not like you can discriminate if you are an immigrant from eVenezuela.

{{quote|
I don't know for sure if you're in SA to take over or to honestly try what I believe is a flawed economic plan. Either way I think you'd be best leaving. The people of this country now believe that you're here to do them harm, and they won't allow you to carry out your plans easily. If you really want to do this so much then you should go to a country like Pakistan. They have a much lower and less active population and it would be easy for you to do your "Experiment" there. South Africa doesn't want you, so why don't you just move on.
|[[faggot|A discouraged faggot]]}}

The [[i/|/i/nsurgents]] have been challenged
[[Image:Lol Gore Spam Reactions.jpg|thumb|[[Reaction guy|Reaction]] to [[pain|gore]] [[spam|spam]]]]
A plan to spam the forums with gore was made. Every [[i/|/i/nsurgent]] posted a tiny pixel image to their every post. When the time was right, it was replace with [[Pain|gore]]. Thus epic win was achieved, giving the fear of an [[i/|/i/nsurgent]] to the minds of every eSouth Africa forum inhabitant.

'''The anti-troll brigade'''

After recovered from the vast spam of [[pain|gore]] on eSouth Africa forums, the hopeless [[faggot|faggots]] started to organize their defence. Posts on /i/ were made, implying that /i/nsurgents should stop fapping, and get out of the basement - so on. Is that even an insult? 

Some win was had, when admins were convinced to give out the dox of the certain poster.

{{quote|
Nope Frank, I'm thinking that you might not be able to handle these morons all that well.

Apparently [[i/|/i/nsurgents]] are now against a well-trained army of internet oldfags who know how to lurk and steal information from IRC channels that have no restrictions. Oh the horror. I think it is the time to pack the bags and leave because we are against such a blatant army of experienced oldfag trolls.


====Defiling the President====

Eventually Wilko had an idea: if you can't destroy the country in one go, why not destroy the life of the [[George Bush|President]]? [[Man|Her]] in game account was logged into and quickly suspended after posting some shocking statements, her email was penetrated and the eSouth African forums were plastered with shock images. 

After being under attack by such grievous force, she decided that it would be good to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]] and proceeded to deleting her credit card and human contacts.

====The Great B&====

After three days of continuous trolling the admins finally caved in the combined butthurt of over 9000 bawwing citizens and wielded the mighty [[banhammer]] on all the brave anons. [[Cop-out|eJustice]] was swift and within a few short hours the main accounts of most of the /i/nsurgents were [[b&]] by the [[fucktards|eRepublik admins]]. The natives celebrated this as a day of victory, but they do not realise that [[Anonymous]] does not forgive and does not forget. The brave anons have regrouped and are currently making plans to recommence the raep in time for the December congressional elections.

After the swift banning, the brave anons began receiving threats from a faggot named [[faggot|Nosferat0987]]. "hacking eRepublik will get you 25 years. Do you not realise what it means to go to jail?" he said. Then he began threatening Anon with [[Internet police|INTERPOL]]. Right there he broke the Code of Anon. You NEVER threaten Anon with [[V&]]. So anon moved swiftly to hack this faggots email. It came easily because the [[faggot]] used a [[faggot]] email. Within an hour, his facebook had been filled with [[pain|nasty shit]], his Paypal information posted to [[4chan]], and his eRepublik account B& for [[faggotry]].

===Operation Raepublik falls apart===

Due to extreme [[Fail|faggotry]], [[butthurt]], [[leaderfag|leaderfaggotry]] and [[i/|/i/nsurgent]] power hungriness the [[raid]] was doomed to crash at some point. The inital plan was to take over ePhilippines (also known as Codename "Orange Islands" in case of [[spies|spais]]), install [[Ultimate Muscle Roller Legend|MuscleRoller's]] (Tietovallu) new account as a "legitimate" president, and leader of a [[V|new revolution]] in the small yet hardworking country's adminstration.

The role was played well, and more [[hacker|anons]] sharing the same goals poured into the IRC. A Finnish imageboard called [[Kuvalauta]] was recruited by posting a thread on it's /b/. Everything was going as planned, socks had been made in order to TO the country, proper media shield and census's were made.

The [[raid]] had been a little unstable from the beginning, one of the original founders had earlier [[leaderfag|four other people]] making decisions how to go forward. [[communism|Dictatorship]] is bad amirite? The so-called [[leaderfag|fagmasters]] had had their balance last for over 3 months, until the #erepublik SOP decided to Jew opper abuse against an egofag for the [[lulz]], an egofag who admitted to getting everyone mass [[b&]] weeks earlier except [[divide by zero|for his own account]]. There had always been reported little incidents, but as the [[fag|channel owner]] was supposed to be neutral, the power had been in balance.

Series of severe BAWWW'ing and waves of [[banned|kickb&]] caused tremendous ammounts of [[fail|drama, trolling and butthurt]]. Tietovallu claimed that he had been behind the massive b& wave, in order to show he is in power and put the other "lesser" fagmasters to their place. He was kickb& from channel due to serious [[leaderfag|egoistic behaviour]], which would have happened earlier but no one other than the supposed "neutral" channel owner would have had the rights to perform such action (because no one asked until then or decided via [[hivemind]] consensus).

Tietovallu went Kittens and [[Whiteknight|whiteknighted]] the whole raid, getting [[cool story bro|cool story bro'ed]] by the [[fag|eRepublik staff]] and an [[b&|instant ban.]]

====Supreme Faggotry====

Not content with having almost ruined everything and pissed off everyone else in the raid, [[faggot|Tietovallu]] then decided in his [[unwarranted self importance|infinite wisdom]] to [[White Knight]] and tell everything to the native Filipinos in their forum. Some accounts were b&, but the vast majority of them survived. Of course [[faggot|Tietovallu]] being, well [[faggot|Tietovallu]] just couldn't resist this additional opportunity to lengthen his e-penis and inflate his already large ego [[over 9000]] times bigger. Not only that but he has in fact teamed up with well-known enemy of anon [[faggot|Nosferat0897]], that's right that very same faggot who threatened to have us all [[v&]]. You've really outdone yourself this time [[faggot|Tietovallu]]!

|I was the leader of the TO group until a leadership struggle came across, the channel owner removed my admin's which lead into massive butthurt kickbanning and abuse on the IRC. Basically the TO failed because of powerhungry faggots.|[[faggot|Tietovallu]], Yes Tiet, blame it all on the "powerhungry faggots". Nothing to do with you [[Ban fucking everyone|getting all our accounts b&]] and bawwwing like a [[13-year-old boy|child]] whenever anything didn't go your way...
|I want to fix the illusion how "Exilious" was a "hacker on steroids". He never did hairy anything, the actual "hacking" of eRep accounts was done by me alone.|[[faggot|Tietovallu]], nothing like the [[lies|truth]] eh Tiet?
|I dont certainly like when own dogs bite after you have gave them power.|[[faggot|Tietovallu]] really believes this. Srsly.
|I dont even think they can do any poodle without me, because I was the main "troll" of the group. |[[faggot|Tietovallu]], it just gets better and better.
|The people who threw me out had no idea how to do anything, they were completely clueless without a leader. Everything basically stopped for a week when they started fighting against me..|[[faggot|Tietovallu]], [[Narcissistic personality disorder|a tragic victim]].
|Everyone did all the stuff I didnt want to do: making multis, making the offsite and IRC, putting sex requests of Ines Schumacher on Johannesburg's craigslist, getting all IRL information and pictures of a person and so on.....|[[faggot|Tietovallu]]. Gosh Batman, we've got a bad case of [[Troll's Remorse]]!

Needless to say that Operation: [[Philippines|Orange Islands]] was mostly a [[fail|failure]]. The infiltration and subtle approach of the anons this time round had been completely [[lol wut|compromised]] by [[faggot|Tietovallu's]] faggotry and whiteknighting. Despite being on course for a congressional majority, the president of the ePhilippines decided to abuse the SOL training wars and [[Oh noes|bawleet]] half their regions, making them part of eMalaysia at the close of elections and therefore [[an hero|voiding]] all the anon candidates running there. Some minor [[win]] was achieved since they had to destroy one of their Q4 hospitals in the process, but on the whole the anons agreed the operation was one of gigantic [[fail]] and [[AIDS]].


===Return to eSouth Africa===
[[Image:Channersinmyerepublik2.PNG|thumb|[[Asking for it|"I'll be Level 500 by the time you get around to doing anything."]]]]
After having been forced out of Thailand due to treachery, the brave anons of Harvad University regrouped and decided to make a glorious return to their previous trolling grounds, a place where epic lulz had already been achieved: black person. One by one, the anons arrived on the shores of South Africa, as past friends and allies from all over the eWorld heard Harvad's call to arms. This time round the orders were simple: to wreak havoc, [[troll]], and achieve their ultimate victory: [[death|the complete and utter destruction of the country]].

====Preparations begin====

From the channers. They say they are back to finish what they started.
|[[fag|Mark Morcom]], the then president of South Africa and all round butthurt faggot}}

Despite publishing [[at least 100]] articles of [[trolling|obvious trolling]], the [[retards|government]] convinced themselves that Harvad were no threat. Their [[lol wut|National Security Status]] level actually went ''down'', so convinced they were of their [[Unrealistic Expectations|safety]]. Little did they realise that behind the scenes, the Harvad University rape machine was hard at work.

[[Image:Namelol.PNG|thumb|[[No|Too harsh?]]]]
Bored and waiting for the electons to arrive the anons saw an opportunity for more delicious [[baw|tears]] and [[rage|lulz]]. To create sock accounts using the [[powerword|IRL names]] of the [[Bureaucratic Fuck|government ministers]]. Dox were uncovered and the accounts were created. The natives [[shat brix]] when they realised Harvad University were had the power to [[Google|hack]] their real information.

Congressional elections came and the anons managed to take an impressive 14 seats out of 40. Minister of Security [[gay|Frank Furglar]] claimed his department had successfully [[epic fail|stopped]] the anons from taking a majority, despite Harvad getting [[epic win|everyone they possibly ran]] into congress. It is thanks to his good work that Harvad could continue trolling at maximum capacity, yet draw absolutely no attention to themselves. [[self pwn|Thanks Frank!]]

However due to certain anons' tendency to publish [[lulzy|racist]] articles and be subsequently <del>[[permab&]]</del> '''LOL appealed''', the anons could no longer block an impeachment. But all was not lost, a certain high ranking faculty member was able to call in a favour from a very old friend in the eUSA military and convince [[goatse|EDEN]] to stage a [[baw|Resistance War]] in [[Brazil|Gauteng]] before the Presidential Elections. Several native members of congress just couldn't resist the chance to be the [[an hero|battle hero]] and help their [[AIDS|country]] kickban the spics from [[lie|their land]]. The war was successful and the South Africans celebrated this as a day of victory. Little did they know they had just wasted [[over 9000|11000]] gold for nothing...

Presidential elections arrived and Harvad finally revealed their super sekrit plan. [[spy|Ronell]] a [[serious business|serious]] player who was well respected within the South African community was actually [[YHBT|working with Harvad]] all along! Contact was quickly made with [[dongcopter|Phoenix]] leadership and Brazil and Argentina proceded to [[rape|wipe]] South Africa from the map as all the regions were [[baleeted|retreated]] one by one. The natives [[raged]] like nothing before as blood and semen rained from the sky.

The notion I get from this whole situation is that these channer fu**tards are really good at what they're doing, they cover up their crap professionally and come out clean so admins, although they know 100% these guys are breaking game rules, can't find any legitimate proof that they do and are too afraid to ban them without one as that way they risk the whole game being hacked.

Oh yeah, and they have no balls. For sure

====Tietovallu returns====
Tiet returns to harvad and <s>does not seem like to much a faggot anymore.</s> [[Disregard|Disregard]], he's still a faggot.

=Future plans with eRepublik=

The current plants of [[anonymous]] on eRepublik are moving ahead. You must be stupider than Tiet if you think we're posting them here. Want to join in and share in some delicious tears? Of course you do, get on IRC nao!|  With out the Alliance of 7Chan and 888CHan any "lulz" and "Win" are pretty much out the window.  Its also to be noted that the two nations so far taken over for the "lulz" have been small and in essence epic fail.  If one really wanted to up the stakes, take over of a rather large nation would be the way to go, but due to the small size of the group and the general Epic Failz of the chan alliances, this will not be accomplished.

Future targets are: eUK, eArgentina (for maximum lulz)and maybe eRussia (but doubtful as it would take more than 10 anons with 10 multies each to achieve this goal)
