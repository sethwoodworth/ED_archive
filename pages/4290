'''Jerry Seinfeld'''Jew is a [[Tony Sidaway|talentless]] Jew "comedian" mostly famous for other peoples' work.  He is also famous for being the least funny character on a show named after him, which of course defines [[fail]].  He has made [[jewgold|billions of dollars]] off the [[anti-lulz|bad taste]] of [[yuppies]], and upon the death of Milton Berle, he inherited the title of "Biggest Douchebag in Comedy" (but later lost it to [[Dane Cook]]).

==The Stand-up Comedy==
Hey, have you ever noticed how all observational comedians just take received [[POV|opinion]] and blatant cliches and spout them off at the audience as if nobody's ever thought of them before? And they keep presenting statements as questions? 
''Waves hand out at the audience, palm facing upward''
I mean, ''come on?'' And then they'll try to expand the joke by basically just repeating it in a specific context, like how I watched this Jerry Seinfeld guy and he did exactly that? 
''Walks to the other side of the stage, continuing the arm movement.''
And, you know, the jokes usually just peter out without a proper punchline, and yadda yadda yadda?

==TV Show==
Jerry's show revolves around the love story of him and his bride-to-be [[An Hero|Anne Frank]]. He tries to escape the Nazis by dressing up as a [[faggot]] in tight jeans and trainers and eats a diet consisting of [[semen|milk]] and [[Cereal Guy|cereal]]. OI VEY!
Seinfeld had this TV show named after him [[at least 100 years ago]] in the nineties that is played endlessly on every channel everywhere. It involves a group of four Jews; Seinfeld is the central jew, one [[basement dweller|still lives with his parents]], one is a Schicksa [[Feminazi | Feminista]] and [[Kramer|one]] acts like a [[fucktard]] while [[not racist|not being racist]].

For some reason, people found this formula involving "[[friends]]" funny and as a result it was copied endlessly, especially by another show called - believe it or not - [[Friends]].

{{squote|The thing I don’t understand about the [[an hero|suicide]] person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don’t die and that’s it. They stop trying. Why? Why don’t they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it’s worse because now they’ve found out one more thing you stink at.|Jerry Seinfeld encouraging people to keep trying at [[suicide]]}}

Currently, Jerry is a stage "comedian" again, since he lacks the talent to set up another comedy show without Larry David telling him what to do. He also whores himself out doing TV commercials, despite having more money than anyone else in the world. As before, Jerry's typical comedic shtick is to whine and bitch worse than the [[French]] about some perfectly innocuous aspect of life. [[Osama bin Laden|Cobra Commander]], his sworn enemy, attempted to clone Seinfeld, but this only ended up in an imperfect copy known as [[Ben Stiller]].

In 2006, [[Kramer|Michael Richards]] [[accidentally]] a stand-up performance by screaming, "He's a black person!" and pointing at a heckler. Although, to be fair, the heckler ''was'' a nigger, so at least he was being honest.

The [[girl|whore]], Julia Louis-Dryfus, had faded into almost total obscurity. After starring in several pilots that were never picked up, several TV shows that didn't last a full season, several [[unfunny]] commercials, and several plays that didn't last the weekend, Dryfus now spends her time huddled around the photo album with her husband Jew remembering the good old days back in the 80's when they were on Saturday Night Live together and weren't thought of as washed up. 

George Konstanza committed a suicide bombing, also known as, "appeared in an episode of Star Trek: Voyager". Despite this usually being a career killer, George bounced back with doing commercials, the voice of a foul-mouthed duck on a low-rated basic cable channel, and doing the 'jerk store' bit at corporate motivational seminars.

In 2007, Jerry went head to head against [[old media|Larry King]] in a Jew Duel (aka  [[circle-jerk|Jewel]]), but [[boring|nothing happened]].  Larry had a sudden case of [[retard]] and forgot about [[math|statistics]] when asking a question about Jerry's show. Jerry proceeded to cry and demand camera attention in a [[fail]]ed attempt to defend his [[unfunny]] career.

I mean, guys, SRSLY, Jerry Seinfeld sucks, he's not funny and he talks about nothing.

== Seinfeld, a XXX parody ==

==Fans==
Most fans are people who [[fail]] or have no life, and are so sad they drown in shitty Jew comedy.  Although studies have also shown that Jerry Seinfeld brings in a huge audience of [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah lovers]], underage [[Paris Hilton|preppie whores]], and [[Scientology|racist Soup Nazis]], the ones Lenny Bruce noticed as always saying, [[Nazi|'''"Let's watch the Jew be charming."''']]
