Neutral point of view
'''Neutral Point of View''' means being unbiased in everything you say. For instance, this article is being completely unbiased right now, unlike all those goddamn [[liberal]] motherfuckers who all are smelly [[hippy|hippies]] and [[dead babies|baby killers]]. They are never unbiased.

[[Fox News]] definitely uses a NPOV. I mean, they constantly remind us that they’re “[[Lie|fair and balanced]]”, so they must be telling the [[Bullshit|truth]]. Fox News would [[nevar]] lie.

Many use the ''' '[[Some argue]]...' ''' phrase before their statement to conveniently bypass NPOV.

tl;dr: NPOV = the polar opposite of [[wikipedia]]

<div style="text-transform:uppercase">Neutral point of view sucks ok.<br>
Nobody ever comes to the [[internet]] with out a goddamned motherfucking point of view to [[cum|spout]] off okay? So this [[bullshit]] about being neutral? It brings up more bullshit than it's worth. And plus people think that not having a point of view on a subject makes you more reliable. No, it makes you more [[stupid]] is what it does. I don't trust you if you aren't spouting off about something. Yell. Scream. Do something. Just don't fucking tell me that i'm not being neutral. There's no such fucking thing so</div>
