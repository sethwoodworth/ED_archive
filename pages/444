[[Image:Anarchy Online Coverart.png|thumb|right|Yep.]]
[http://www.anarchyonline.com/ '''''Anarchy Online'''''] is considered the worst [[sci-fi]] [[MMORPG]] evar made. It was made like eight or so years ago by Funcom, who are located in [[Norway]]. This game's original gameplay featured people running around doing mission after mission. The missions were internal and generated randomly. People found this very boring so they released dungons to go along with this boring game. Eventually they released a "booster pack" which in short means a patch you pay for. This allowed for people not just to PvP, but to attack some stupid towers that gave Orgs (see guilds) speacial bonuses no one needs. Orgs are part of the [[Hippie|Clan]] or [[Capitalism|Omni]] faction, or you can be a gay neutral fence sitting faggot and not join a faction. There are only <s>three</s> two servers. RK1: Atlantean and RK2: Rimor. There was a [[German]] server, RK3: ''<s>Die Neue Welt</s>'' ''Das Dritte Reich,'' but it was [[System32|beleted]].

All in all, this game is really stupid. People who still play it have been playing it from launch and don't know better. The max level was 200, but with the ''Shadowlands'' expansion pack, you get 20 ''shadowlevels'' which are like Funcom's way of saying "fuck you". The ''Shadowlands'' expansion also is [[Fantasy|less sci-fi]] and instead all its content is taken straight from [[WoW]] and [[EQ]]. Then they gave us 30 alien levels with the "alien invasions" exp. which allows you to ask aliens to attack you, they never randomly invaide you, at all. Then when ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' came out, everyone left ''Anarchy Online'', making Funcom get [[butthurt]]. They released an expansion called ''Lost Eden'' which consisted of more overpowered weapons, more to whine about and a "Battlestation" which is a large scaling instance based PvP zone. Its layout never changes (it is fun 5 times?) where everyone else is better than you. With all the fail in the game, many people have left.

While the game is ancient, it still gives the player many different ways to make his character unique. You can choose from a variety of high-tech implants to boost skills you suck at, like [[tits|chest]], [[fap|wrist]] and other boring shit. It really is complex, so here is a link to a equipment configuration site ([http://auno.org/ao/equip.php?saveid=104183 ''Auno.org'']). The armor in the game looks horrible and Funcom had to introduce a shitty "social tab", which is just another tab page you have to keep up with in your equip menu as if implants, armor, weapons didn't block it up enough, [[EQ2|so that you can appear as wearing nothing but a thong on your grey mutant weirdo]].

<br>

==Professions (Classes)==
*'''Adventurer''' - This class can be an animal. They have different [[cat]] forms, [[wolf]] form, [[dragon]] form, and [[Arborphilia|tree form]]. Popular with closet [[Furry|furries]].<Br>

*'''Agent''' - They can hide from everything. They can also cosplay the doctor, and heal while doing decent damage. They can also [[trap]] melee classes for easy ganking. In fact, this is one of the gank classes, so if [[you]] play it you are most likely a [[pussy]] because you can only shoot and run away.

*'''[[Bureaucrat]]''' - They're really lame to play, all they do is [[Luring|charm]] shitty NPCs and whine. Besides increasing the amount of XP you get from punching the same guy over and over, and few lame area buffs, everything else is crowd control. [[Lie|(Because people loves to play a character who's only ability is to prevent someone else from moving.)]]

*'''[[Boring|Doctor]]''' - They have the ability to heal and do no damage. They never die and nevar kill. Don't attack these. Or else you will probably end up fighting until [[Mod|someone]] finally decides to [[divide by zero]]. 

*'''Enforcer''' - Big and strong, but they are melee, so most of the time you get "you are not close enough to attack" spamming your screen.

*'''[[Engineer]]''' - A gay pet class no one plays. Engineers are also known to be the makers of "[[Giant enemy crab|crab]]" and are also known as "tradeskilling monkeys".

*'''[[Hacker|Fixer]]''' - Fast, ranged, and can [[Don't taze me bro|stun people]]. People would usually get bored of this class if they didn't get fixer grid, which somehow makes this class fun.

*'''[[EverQuest|Keeper]]''' - Came out with ''Shadowlands''. They have amazing damage and health. Their perk attacks are the best. They get auras that enable them to EVERYTHING and used to be [[God|unkillable]]. Not anymore, fuckers!

*'''[[Weeaboo|Martial Artist]]''' - 50000 years into the future and [[Retard|you are using your fists.]] [[pretty cool guy|i think Martial Artist is a pretty cool guy, eh uses his fists against guns and doesn't afraid of anything.]]

*'''[[Pok√©mon|Metaphysicist]]''' - Another gimpy pet class. Who cares?

*'''Nano Technician''' - A class you will never see because [[Blacks|you will be dead when there's one nearby]].

*'''[[Gimp|Shade]]''' - This class is basically Agent except no rifle, but with butter [[cut|knives]], [[fag|leaves]], and [[shit]]. [[Orgasm|Dies very fast]]. They also have terrible armor. However, their new nanos do give them a fighting chance, almost as much as [[Kenny Glenn The Animal Abuser| Dusty had against Glenn]].

*'''[[Army|Soldier]]''' - This class gets the best things in the game. It's really the most overpowered character in any MMO until a Trader with BR reflect drains you, or a NT with reflect bypassing nukes pumps you, or the engi runs up and hugs you and splashes NSD all over your face like mayo makeup. Really funny to watch Esquobar tear his opponents new holes, running around lol'n at all the /tears that follow when he takes down 4 people at once.

*'''Jew''' - He drains the life from you making you a pathetic pile of [[shit]]. Traders are a sort of parasitic leech who sometimes help a poor guy to equip a new sword before complaining about not getting any tip. They fill two important functions in the game: First, they are a poor excuse when a developer screws up and make another class too strong by receiving an ability to completely destroy said class. Then, they make everyone's life miserable by stealing their health, armor, evasion, skills, energy, shields, and virginity before rooting them. [[Lulz|Sometimes a trader feels sorry for you and shoot you in the face with a shotgun.]]

==Factions==
* '''Omni-Tek'''
They own just about everything in AO's world of Rubi-Ka. Most players go with them because they will get the upper-hand.

* '''The Clans'''
The rebel faction, they fight with Omni-Tek for the control of Rubi-Ka and [[America|freedom!]] Too bad they suck.

* '''Neutrals'''
They form alliances with Omni-Tek when they are not [[You|sitting on the fence, undecided.]] They are the 1 in 10 that don't know who to vote for.

==Raiding==
[[Image:vhablol.jpg|thumb|right|RK1 [[faggot|player]] Vhab in the middle of an epic raid]]
Well, since the game lacked a raid system since... forever, the people of ''Anarchy Online'' were forced to create their own raid system. Vhab bot was born, or vhabot, hellcom, or whatever the fuck, and it makes loads of different bots which allowed people to join the raid, roll for items, chat and such. Items that were noDrop (can't be traded) were distributed by buying the loot rights with "point" which you get for doing multiply raids. 1 raid usually got you 7 points, and it [[over 9000|takes 600]] to get anything good. Making gear take forever, and lots of ninja-looting (taking things and then leaving) and drama spout from this. There is a forum you must use to apply to be allowed to raid. Clan and omni had different raid bots.<Br>

'''UPDATE:''' The URL to this article was posted on the vhabot forums. These are the reactions!


{{squote|Still not funny. I guess FC agreed as they removed all 3 of your threads.|[[Retard|Nuclearsmeg]]}}
{{squote|Find a new line of work.  Writing isn't for you. You can't tell me you're surprised Funcom removed the posts?  It's their official forums.|[[Retard|Nuclearsmeg]]}}
{{squote|Boring. Fell asleep somewhere midst reading it...|[[Retard|deniska]]}}
{{squote|Utterly boring. I would delete it from the site if I was a mod or something. Total lack of creative writing skills. Lame insults skill though - 100%|[[Retard|Octopuss]]}}

==Patches==
When the game was released the patches were sporadic, and while scarce they did actually fix some shit. Lately (as in the past 3 years of this game) patches are used to [[Ruin|break the game]]. Patches can be rated from 10 to 1, 10 being crap patch but fixing some shit while breaking some other to 1, meaning they will break a lot of shit, add a lot of crap nobody will use, and you'll have to pay for it. As of late, "1" means a booster or an expansion pack.

On average, a patch breaks 3 things per stuff it fixes, so each shitty patch tends to have exponential bug adding, and sometimes not fixing anything and only adding bugs (Funcom team calls these "[[PSP|features]]"). Also know as the infamous '''GM''' term "''Working as intended''", when that's big fat fucking [[lie]].

In [[2009]], Funcom did another shitty patch, as expected it fucking sucked. But this time they surpased themselves and fucked so bad they had to do a rollback. [http://forums.anarchy-online.com/showthread.php?t=556365 Here's the official word!] [http://www.overstream.net/view.php?oid=eqevt4t5njnz AO players even get very outraged by this.]

==Free To Play==
[[Image:Ao free play billboard.jpg|thumb|right|Ad boards all over the city.<br><sub>(Buy energy drinks!)</sub>]]
With the death of the game near about 4 years ago, Funcom decided to make the original (no expansions) game free. You are just lagged up by [[Spam|ads]] from time to time in order to play for free. They later allowed people the Notumn Wars "booster pack" for free along with the original version. Goddamn.

===Paid Points!===
[[Image:InsetPremium.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cool story bro|Premium content]]!]]
[[Image:Ao-paidpoints.jpg|thumb|right|Click this thumbnail to see the [[Judaism]] in action!]]
Recently ''Anarchy Online'' obtained a ''paid point'' system. This allows people to purchase items [[SOE|in-game for real-money]]. It's [http://www.failcom.com/ Failcom's] newest way in sucking all the [[money]] from their old pile of shit. They clam these items are for fun only, and create no in-game advantage. Three of these items were originally items given to people for pre-ordering expansions. Instead of keeping them to the 1337 oldfags they give them to newfags for money. Hurray!

<br>
'''Items Purchased through Paid Points:'''
* Phasefronts (Holy fucking shit, hovercars!)
* Hoverboards (Skateboards of the future, only vehicle allowed in shadowlands = advantage)
* Leet pets (Summon your very own [[bat]] or something.)
* Luxury Apartment (Biggest personal home in-game = advantage for epeen RP fags.)
* Lost Eden Special Edition Mech (Really sucks and doesn't do anything.)
* [[Hot Topic|Clothes]] (Cowboy suit anyone? Great for fags!)

{{clear}}

=== ''Item Store'' ===
With rapid amounts of people dropping their subscription [[butthurt]] [[fail|Funcom]] decided to try and take every last penny they could from their current subscribers. Now you can play real-world currency for +20% xp for a span of a few hours. You can also buy [[gay|clothes]] and [[fetish|decorations]]. It is important to note that this is a completely different system than paid points, meaning the game now has two major ways to [[Jew]] you out of money

{{clear}}

=== ''Legacy Of The Xan'' ===
[[Image:Legacy.gif|thumb|right|Fail for 19.95!]]
Funcom is now giving up on full expansions, instead, releasing content packs for 19.95 USD/EURO. ''Legacy of the Xan'' is the first of these, and was released instead of the much-anticipated graphics update. This pack is content for [[Basement dwellers|max level characters (220) only]]. It, in a nutshell, is an area where you kill the same [[boring]] stuff, then fight another big boss. Forgetting that most people would probably never be able to get on the highest [[Boobs|implant]] in the game, they released even higher-leveled implants. Hurray!

==Toboexxx==
Some guys in a clan got [[butthurt]] at some noob trying to boss them around. Toboexxx, a clan member on RK1, is one the dumbest humans alive. He bugged PvP raidbot [[admins]] about being a leader until he was finally put in charge of gathering low level players and sending them to the [[Iraq|battlefield]]. [[W|He went power crazy]]. So people got annoyed and started showing him his own stupidity by quoting him. He also made his own [[Scientology|org]] (guild) over and over. (Currently, it could be Striking Fear.) Here are some [[Lulz|funnies]] from people in his org or himself.


'''[[mudkips|i heard u leik towers]]'''

'''Update (May 8, 2009):''' Still no graphics updates. While there have been worthless bug fix patches, and a paid point program released, there hasn't been a single announcement of the graphics update in 2009 to this date.

'''Update (May 12, 2010):''' Still no graphics update! Their official site only has one post from 2010 and that is "ANARCHY ONLINE VOTED FOR TOP 8 BEST F2P MMO'S BY GAMES RADAR!" They're getting pretty desperate when they're excited about being one of the top (not THE TOP) [[shit|free]] MMO's. One of their recent patches, patch 18.3.4, it boasted in the update notes "ICC Peacekeepers have some new flashy outfits for a new flashy year." Seems like this game wont be around for much longer.
