SCA
The Society for Creative Asshattery, uh... Anachronism. The SCA is known by many names, most of them more deserved than the formal title. A corporation formed during a drunken orgy in the 70s has been fueled by obese losers dreaming of Kingdoms ever since. PT Barnum would have been jealous. There is a severe and chronic crossover between alcoholism, the SCA, obesity, "ren faires", and other stupidity.

The SCA is lovingly known by its members to also represent:

- Society for Consenting Adults

- Swilling Cocks and Asses

- Suicidal for Cheeseburgers and Ale

- Speed and Coke Addicts

- Stupid Corpulent Asses

Reasons for joining the SCA include witnessing your own children being deflowered, drinking at the age of 12, eating undercooked food, drinking cheap home-made beer, and putting on about 20 pounds a year to round out that armor. It's a really good way to spend about 100 a day camping without gaining any of the benefits of things like toiletries or other healthy facilities. If you like camping in horse pastures and setting fire to shit while drunk - this is your club.

Power cliques within the SCA include prostitutes, distilleries, and smugglers. These are usually regarded as His Majesty, Her Majesty, or some other fake-crown-wearing tool. Politics in the SCA revolve around the cliques. The next King is usually the fattest guy who hasn't been King for a while, and has kept up on his beer funds. Want to be a make believe king? Join up, supply the kegs for the next six months and you're in. The amount of sycophants and ugly maiden-wanna-bes is rather sickeningly fascinating to those outside the 'noble circle.'

Followed home to their 'mundane' domicile in a mobile home or apartment, these nobility of the dark ages celebrate and personify some of the worst eras of the Europe. They speak intentionally fucked-up English as though this is any sort of substitute for not knowing Gaelic or even Welsh. Almost none of the SCA have any college background at all, as education is apparently still as anathema to them today as it was in the 7th Century.

The walls of their homes are often not visible far below the ceiling, having been subjected to the odious task of bearing all their "gear." If a scrap-booking manic nun had sex with ten demons and spend a hundred years on a crack cocaine powered binge of knitting useless shit, that's a pretty close description of what these walls bear. Many of the homes witnessed are so filled with actual garbage and pets as to be unlivable, as the SCA people appear to only live life in the 'mundane' world as a type of slow-witted zombie.
