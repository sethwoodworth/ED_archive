What do you get when you cross [[Japan|whale-starved savages]] with [[Greenpeace|ocean-faring eco-terrorists]]?  A recipe for lulz, that's what.  It takes a [[Charles Manson|truly talented troll]] to coax a bunch of stoned-out hippies into throwing flash grenades at peaceful, slightly hungry researchers. 

==The story thus far==
While whaling is [[Japan]]'s favorite pastime, (followed closely by [[bukkake]] and [[an hero|kamikaze]] training), it is a practice pretty much lost on the rest of the world.  [[Last Thursday]], the [[Australia|Australian]] government asked Japan to stop whaling in Australian waters and [[gb2]] killing endangered species in their own back yard.  Several national ads and tv shows expressed their distaste for Japanese yum-yums.

[[BAWWW|Being a teeny-tiny bit sensitive to criticism]], Japanese [[JewTube|YouTubers]] and their [[Wapanese|sympathizers]] proceeded to hurl every bizarre insult at Australia that they could think of - in [[Engrish|hilariously broken English]] - through the medium of YouTube comments and [[tl;dr]] videos.

==[[Goatse|Boats]]==
[[irony|Greenpeace only seems to use boats that were once whaling ships or seal clubber transport vessels]]. They convert them for fitting in every environmentally friendly appliance possible, then set out, belching diesel fumes into the air. On some occasions the ships have done more harm than good, with Greenpeace members throwing chemicals off the sides of ships, and accidentally ramming coral reefs. This is because no qualified Captain will work for them, and they can only get [[asspies|illigal Polish immigrants]] to sign up these days.

This is a list of ships in the Greenpeace Navy.

*Rainbow Warrior STATUS: Destroyed  FRAGS: 1
*Rainbow Warrior II STATUS: In Use
*MV Artic Sunrise STATUS: In Use
*MV Esperanza STATUS: In use
*Argus STATUS: Unknown
*Moby [[Dick]] STATUS: Unknown
*MV Greenpeace STATUS: Decommissioned -- Now a Museum Ship
*Ady Gil - sea below.

==Ady Gil==

Enter the '''Ady Gil''', the aquatic version of your neighborhood watch.  Initially known as the ''Earthrace'' and made for breaking the record for [[shit nobody cares about|circumnavigating the globe]], it was re-purposed as the wet-dream of [[nerd|über-nerd]] and [[fat]]so, Cap'n Paul Watson.

'''"Captain" Paul Watson''' is a [[Canadian]] best known for being so bat-shit [[insane]] that he was actually kicked out of [[Greenpeace]].  He's also not a captain of anything, and a fat [[vegan]] to boot.  As with most [[USI|people who bestow themselves with honorific titles]], he's into [[cosplay]], as evidenced by the home-made patches on his Old Navy pea coat.  He also loves an audience and can't stop [[lying|talking]] when the tape is rolling.  Here are some of his best bon mots.

{{morphquote|mqtest3|background-color:white;|font-weight: bold;|There's nothing wrong with being a terrorist, as long as you win. Then you write the history.||People are the [[AIDS]] of the Earth||..earthworms are far more valuable than people.||If you don’t know an answer, a fact, a statistic, then ... make it up on the spot.||}}</center>

==Shonan Maru==
The '''Shonan Maru''' and it's sister ship '''2''' (inventive) are the security vessels and harpoon ships for the Japanese whaling fleet.  Er, research team.  On January 6, 2010, the Shonan Maru 2 [[pwnt]] the Ady Gil by driving like typical [[azn|Asians]], e.g., right over its fucking bow.  A [[New Zealand|kiwi]] cameraman on board broke some ribs, probably from laughing too hard as the Batboat sunk to the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean.

One month later, the [[lemonparty|Bob Barker]] was rammed by the Yushin Maru 3, creating [[Girlvinyl's vagina|a 3-foot long, 4-inch deep gash]] in the mid starboard side of the Sea Shepherd vessel above the waterline.  While the [[cunt|Japanese supporter]]s claimed this as a victory, their [[win]] was short-lived; the Yushin Maru 3 was [[Mexican]]-grade lazy in the water.

In a fit of further lulz, the Japanese crews came up with the [[lie|great idea]] of using jet-pack-propelled pepper spray guns.  At sea.  During high winds.  El oh el.

==The Volunteers==
The viewer is quick to realize that the majority of the cast is completely [[retarded]]. This makes sense, as the only people who would volunteer for this mission are the people [[do not want|you don't want]]. For lulz, count the amount of times teams enter the rafts and neglect to use the radio or satphone and end up getting lost. Watching this show is like watching your grandparents trying to use Facebook.
