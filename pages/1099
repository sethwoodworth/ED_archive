Boobpedia
[[Image:Ifonly.jpg|thumb|If only they were [http://www.boobpedia.com/boobs/Bea_Flora all this hawt], Boobpedia's [[Alexa]] rank would be coming close to 1/10th that of [[Uncyclopedia]], never mind [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] (although HOLY SHIT OMG Boobpedia is [[at least 100]] times more popular than [[Wikinfo]]!!!!!)]]
'''Boobpedia''' is a [[wiki]] about [[women]] with [[epic|big, even huge]] [[tits]], specifically [[porn]] stars and [[whore|adult models]]. There are some hot women on the site but you must proceed with caution. There are many [[fat]]ties, and women with comically large fake breasts such as Chelsea Charms. The site is run by two [[sysop]]s called Hexvoodoo and The Honorable. They have a tough stance on [[vandalism]], and both also edit over at [[TOW]], but due to its strict [[notability]] requirements most of the [[camwhore]]s that they want to write about cannot be included there, making it quite a good directory for your porns if you are not either [[gay]], a [[pedophile]], or an [[ephebophile]], which [[you]] are.

==A Superior Wiki==

Much of the information on [[Boobpedia]], like any wiki, is [[lie|completely 100% accurate]]. In fact, they often go out of their way to correct [[Old|birthdates]] and [[Tranny|other information]] that other sources get wrong.

[[Image:Miosotis.jpg|thumb|As mentioned above.|Miosotis]]

{{quote|Miosotis (born September 16, 1980 in the Dominican Republic) is a model featured on [[fat|Nadine Jansen]]'s website.

A small Caribbean island is the home and birthplace of this [[Chris Benoit|breathtaking]] [[horse|black beauty]] with [[Niggertits|gigantic natural K cup tits]]. She was born the youngest daughter of a fisherman with [[Eurabia|European]] ancestry, and his wife with black person. At [[loli|the age of 11]] it was clear that she not only got her skin color from her mother but also her upper measurements.}}

Holy shit, Hispaniola is a "small island"? That's news to some [[EDiot]]s, because [[Wikipedia]] thinks that it's the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_by_area 22nd largest island in the world], which would hardly be small (kinda like her breasts).  That just goes to show you how shitty of an encyclopedia [[TOW]] is when they can't even get basic geography right.

The site has a policy of creating featured articles about once a month. Lulz was created when they chose the 25-year-old [[Canadian]] [[fat]] [[goth]] chick Blu Velvet, who apparently likes it [[in the ass]] according to her Boobpedia page.

{{quote| Ok, now [[WTF]]

No, thats it, I'm sorry, but have our standards dropped SO MUCH? No seriously, I understand we are supposed to be an encyclopedia of gals with [[Milk bags|big boobs]], but WTF! Do you realize how many potential visitors could be turned away by this? [[Shay|I nearly tossed my lunch when I saw this]] on the main page! And don't try to argue how many more people will end up staying, I guarantee you that more people are turned away than stay after seeing... [[DO NOT WANT|this]].

As a man who [[not gay|loves big boobs]]... damnit, I have [[unrealistic expectations|standards]]! And don't think I only like anorexic chicks either, I happen to be a huge [[Pr0n|Brandy Taylor]] fan, and she is by no means Anorexic.

Is it that we [[Fail|can't get anyone better]]? I mean really, this is just low. I understand that we should keep an open mind about things like this, but hell, [[Perverts|our friends over at Boobieblog]] would never put her up, and [[ebonics|lawd]], they put on Normis (with all the pictures blacked out unless you wanted to see them). *shudder*

Can we please get a NEW featured article as soon as possible, I would totally be [[fap|willing to help]] on the project|DDrendar}}

As you can see from the photos, the site is [[desperate]], and will interview any woman with breasts.  Another prime example of this would be [[Sweet Eva|Eva]], a 52-year-old German pictured in the gallery below.
