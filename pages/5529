'''Mudkipchan''' first appeared on [[4chan]]'s /[[b]]/ very early August 1 of '07.  Her entire body is covered in paint, obviously to attract a [[mudkip|mate]].   

By not covering her ears with [[MS Paint|paint]], she falsely reveals her [[race]] as [[white]].  But further pictures of her show that it was an illusion and she is in fact [[Mexican]] prompting guys to request that she keep the paint on.

In recent developments she appears to have abandoned pokefags in favor of meaty PC gamers, appearing with the half-life symbol on her breasts in a noticeable unmudkipped way.

==Note From The Mudkipchan Herself==

|I'm not a [[camwhore]], or even an [[attention whore]] for that matter.
The True Story behind the Mudkipchan, came simply from a bet my
x-bf and I made to see whether or not I could make mudkips [[fappable|sexy]].
(you be the judge...) When we broke up he decided to put them on
the internet.(/b/ strikes again!!).|Mudkipchan.
|The Half-life(his game of choice) pictures were also a bet btwn
him and I, just to see if I would do it.|Mudkipchan.
|And, thread(No.34647222)is total bs, I never said my body was the only thing I had.|mudkipchan.
|If /b/ has anything to say, by all means lemme hear it:

==A Challenger Appears!==
In Novemeber 2009, this "MudkipChan" appeared on /b/. Though [[shooped]], [[moar]] [[mudkip]] was met with much praise. But failed since this one used photoshop and not real paint.
