A '''botnet''' is a collection of computers that have been infected with [[virus]]es that allow [[hackers|nefarious individuals]] to take control of your computer (which becomes a "[[zombie]]" and part of a "[[bot army]]") and use it for [[DDoS|nefarious business]]. The [[tl;dr|overall]] result is a virtual 'army' of zombie computers ready to do the bidding of the nefarious [[Lex Luthor|botnet's owner]]; usually eating virtual brains.

Botnets are a valuable commodity on the [[Internets Black Market]] available to any [[Aush0k|fuckwit]] with a [[carding|stolen credit card]] and a burning desire to get [[v&]], [[lolsuit|prosecuted]] and [[assrape|jailed]] with [[OJ|hardened criminals]]. They can be found on [[hacker]] forums and on hacker [[IRC]], but your best bet -if you want one- is to ask the guys at [http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2006/may '''David's DDOS Shop'''].

Well known fuck-me-over botnets are: MyDoom, Blaster, Storm Worm, [[AIDS]], and SQL Slammer.
When a faggot makes a botnet, he typically steals Rbot or RxBot code from http://www.vxchaos.2hell.com .
Only n00bz use that shit. Botnets are capable of many things:

#Fucking you over.
#Taking your [[internets]].
#Making you look like a criminal (Wiki "NetBus")
#Stealing CP.
#Making you and thousands of others pwn someone
#Stealing your 'nfo
#DDoS
#????
#PROFIT!!!

Most of the time, a botnet is used to [[Denial of Service|DDoS]] a site.
When some one issues a command, it's usually through [[IRC]]. When a faggot decides to DDoS the net, on R/xBot platforms, he issues:
.ddos.random [[internet]] 60.
That takes down the internet, providing he has 29493939493843937984739348.34 Commodore 64's.

The unknown, yet largest botnet to date, is the "[[Wikipedia:Storm botnet|Storm botnet]]." Storm has achieved a record of 1.7Million bots on Semptember, 2007.
This botnet attacked a [[Republican]] website for [[lulz]], generating [[OMG|5 gigabytes of traffic a second]] against the site. <s>[[britfag|Fried chips]]</s> (It's french fries, you fuckmouth cockney limey faggot), anyone?

The [[Conficker]] worm was also considered a botnet, which infected near 9 million computers running windows. It is estimated that it still infects up to 7 million computers. 

==TsunamiOverHost==

With this tool you can create your own botnet and attack in 3 types of attacks:

    * UDP
    * ICMP
    * HTTP 

This paper and the software has been made for educational purposes only, the author will not take any responsibilities of you using TsunamiOverHost application.

First of all if you want to be successful on using this bot read this how-to carefully.

===Things that you need===
    *  The Program
          o TsunamiOverHost.exe
          o 4 files in one folder
                + index.php
                + online.php
                + update.php
                + update.txt 

    * A Host (You will only need ~10KB.)
          o MySQL or some other database management system where you'll create a special "botnet" table. 
===Uploading===
Ok, now you know what you need, and what you should have, lets get to the real business ; - )

   1. Create a folder.
   2. Copy index.php, online.php, update.php, update.txt.
   3. Paste it to the folder that you made.
   4. Open index.php with some text editor, and where it says: SETTINGS FOR ADMIN ACCESS Put your login and the pass, etc.
         1. $login = "yourLogin";
         2. $password = "yourPassword"; 
   5. Save.
   6. Go to your mysql database.
   7. Create a new database.
   8. Create a new table, for example open the sql manager and paste this : CREATE TABLE botnet ( date int NOT NULL, ip varchar(40) NOT NULL, b_id int unsigned primary key NOT NULL auto_increment);
   9. Save it.
  10. Open your online.php file, and look for "Set MySQL database variables" Change the following variables:
         1. $online_db_host = "yourHost ( ex . mysql.domain.com )";
         2. $online_db_name = "yourDatabaseName ( ex . haxior )";
         3. $online_db_user = "yourUser ( user for the database ) ";
         4. $online_db_pass = "yourPass ( password to the database )"; 
  11. Save. 

Now in your folder you should have two updated and two old files.

   1. Connect to your ftp ( ex . using flashfxp )
   2. Copy the folder that you have made to your host.
   3. Change the CHMOD's of file update.txt to 777.
   4. Disconnect. 

After setting everything up, you will open TsunamiOverHost.exe, and give the path to the folder that you just updated to your ftp. ( ex . domain.com/panel )

If everything goes fine, you will find a new file called server.exe. This file will be responsible for the power of the bot, More people open it = the bot will be more powerfull. In the panel, you will be able to see how many server.exe files are running on other peoples computers!

Yes! Lets have some fun:

   1. Go to your panel (the one you uploaded through ftp, ex. domain.com/panel.)
   2. Login. 

I don't think i have to explain anything now, but remember the author will not take any responsibilities of the results!


Update: Most hosts won't let you run Tsunami off of it. Your best bet is to get WAMP (http://anonym.to/http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php) and run the host off your own computer.

Delete any if they die.

Be careful; this is not a joke, as you will be sued up the ass.

==IRC Botnet==

This is probably the most common type of botnet, and the type most skiddies aspire to control.  With this botnet, '''Windows''' systems get infected by running the bot executable, then the bot will start up with Windows and connect to an [[IRC]] server controlled by the "bot master".  These bots usually come with spreaders built in; most of these were out of date in 2005, so don't expect much except 3rd world infections and honeypots.

You will find thousands of different bot sources, most with non-functioning copypasta'd features.  Some common features are [[DDoS#DDoS|DDoS]], pass stealing, updating, downloading files from URLs, and executing.  Some rarer features are IM spreading, keylogging, and messaging the victim.

Getting a reasonable net (over 9,000) is extremely difficult and almost impossible for someone with no "connections", as finding an IRC server to host the net on isn't easy (don't pay for it on your own CC); and spreading is pretty difficult unless you have access to a private crypter.

===Requirements===

#[http://anonym.to/http://www.megaupload.com/?d=SUHPYZRX Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0]
#[http://anonym.to/http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=a8494edb-2e89-4676-a16a-5c5477cb9713 Service Pack 6 for Visual C++ 6.0]

#[http://anonym.to/http://www.mediafire.com/?zsyiiqlqnxw Rxbot source code]

Rar passwords: itzforblitz

'''This rxbot is around 5 years old, and unfortunately there hasn't been much evolution in publically available bots since then; but I would recommend unkbot or something from a reptile base.'''

===IRCD===

So you are going to need an IRC server to control your bots from.  The general consensus is on the best way to do this is install an ircd on a linux server/vps that has absolutely no connection to you.  You can obtain one of these by:
#Paying some shady user on certain marketplaces boards for one 
#Finding one you can "root"
#If you consider yourself especially clever card a server.

Other methods which you should '''NOT''', I repeat '''NOT''' use are:
#Install unreal on you home server. (brb v&)
#Use a public IRC server. (oh hai gline)
#Buy a server/vps with your own details.

====Modded ircds====
*h1t3m IRCD - Has security features so only ops can see channels, whois, etc.  No increased user volume features as far as I can tell.

===Steps===

#Install Visual C++ 6.0 and its service pack
#Once installed, configure the motherfucker:
  
*In tools -> options, go to DIRECTORIES tab, and click on the first icon that is on the left of the red cross.  
*In SHOW DIRECTORIES FOR, select INCLUDE FILES  
*Now, browse to the INCLUDE folder that PSDK-X86 installed (i.e : in my box, its at C:\Program files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include)and select it. Remember to use the arrows to place it at the top of the list.

http://anonym.to/http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/656/clipimage004ri7.gif

Now, in SHOW DIRECTORIES, select Library Files and Source Files, and in both cases, select where library and source files are located at (again, i.e : C:\Program files\MICROSOFT PLATFORM SDK\LIB and C:\Program files\MICROSOFT PLATFORM SDK\SRC)

http://anonym.to/http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/6382/clipimage005ae0.gif

Click Ok.

===Configuring Rxbot===

*File>Open Workspace, and select the folder where Rxbot source code is at.
*Find the '''configs.h''' file (might be in "headers" folder, or not, it depends on the Rxbot version), and at your right, you will see all of its parameters; this is were you are going to edit it as you prefer.

===Compiling===
Go to Build>Rebuild All.. If you did it right, then it should say Rbot.exe - 0 errors, 0 warnings.

http://anonym.to/http://bp2.blogger.com/_QKWgCjfqXOU/R7PArEYpWTI/AAAAAAAAAZA/6fKtJ8XpmgI/s400/clipimage009io3.jpg

Your rbot.exe is, by default, in the RELEASE folder.. windows+F if you are stupid enough not to find it.

===Making it Undetected===

If you got to this point, it means that you have your irc server and bot ready to rumble... But there are 2 problems:

#AVs will detect it
#By itself, it only executes the code in the background, so your victims will be suspicious.

'''So, you should do 2 things:'''

#<del>make it stealth with a crypter</del>
#<del>Bind it to another executable</del>
#All of the above.

Long story short: download [http://anonym.to/http://www.megaupload.com/?d=DH6XX69O Porno Crypter generated: 30.10.2009 at 18.04.35 (GMT 1) ] (pass: 1234). - '''(PROTIP: Lurk on hack boards and watch for new public crypter releases, these will serve you much better than this crypter)'''.

*Go to www.novirusthanks.org(make sure to check "do not distribute sample") and run a scan on your rbot.exe, and you will see that almost 24/24 Avs will detect it.
*Now crypt your rbot.exe, upload it again to novirusthanks.org, and you will see that half or less than half of AVs detect it.. You can do this with any crypter (the newer, the less detected the bot executable will be after encrypted)

Ok, rbot.exe is crypted. Now, we have got to bind it to another executable file, so when some dumbass nigger executes whatever the hell it is that you attached the bot to, the bot will run silently in the background ñ_ñ

*[http://anonym.to/http://www.megaupload.com/?d=HO4OCJQ1 Advanced File Joiner v1.0]

#Bind it to a game crack or a new game's setup.exe (dunno, use ur imagination)
#Upload it to emule, ares, torrent, etc to get the infection going.
#????
#PROFIT!
