Asianface
{{Forced Meme}}

'''Asianface''' is an original [[7chan]] meme, in which the humorousry [[retarded]], gross face of an [[Azn|asian]] from some television program is photoshopped onto other people's fugly faces, supposedly resulting in [[lulz]]. 7chan [[Engrish|roves]] it because they made it themselves, but [[Epic Fail|IT IS COMPLETE fail]] to everyone else, apart from [[13 year old boys]]. The asianface guy is actually [[Japan|Ayumu Kato]], a comedian from the comedian duo [[moonspeak|Zabungle]] or ZA-BUN-GU-RU. He made that face, again, after he gets wiped out from the [[penis|Log Grip]] section in the 22nd [[Ninja]] Warrior tournament. As of June 28th, of the the year 2010, this forced meme was renamed by an anon on /b/. The new name is "No Doubles, Try Again".
