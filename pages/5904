OMG
__NOTOC__
[[Image:Oh no!.gif|thumb|right|275px]]
An abbreviation of "[[Oh]] My God", '''[[Oh|O]]MG''' is the [[internets]]' equivalent to "holy shit". Usually notes total and complete astoundment. [[Oh|O]]MG can also be used as a greeting in the place of "hi" or "[[soup|sup]]". As of the newly released [[Web 2.0]], [[ZOMG]] is now the accepted abbreviation.

To [[fat]] fucks who can't stop thinking about food, it stands for "zero milligrams" when seen on Nutritional Facts on any food item.
