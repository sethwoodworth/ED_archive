they gays, trannies and faggots, young and old that come here ! |}}

Battlecam.com [http://www.battlecam.com/alkidavid] is an interactive online video chat site that allows users to "cam up" on the main page while be watched by a crowd of 50 to 500. Underneath the users video is a "line up" of other people waiting to cam up and take their shot at staying on as much as time allows.  Anyone registered for a free account has the abilities to vote like or poop. If you don't want to register, you can still watch the zany gay antics that go on each day.

Make no mistake. This is not your kids fucking chat room.  Be prepared to be called anything you have ever heard including more.  "Get off cam you dickfuck!".  "STGFO" Show tits or get the fuck out!" 

"Mangina's".  The art of tucking your penis and balls back under your legs and standing there in a pose FOR every other faggot to watch.

Battlecam.com is the only chat site on the entire internet to allow others to vote "like" or "poop" on who they are watching.  Anyone who cams up can gain points for the amount of time over one minute they stay broadcasting. The object is to gain as many points as you can and then trade them in for tons of junk made in china.  (See points section below for list of prizes)

Battlecam started in March of 2010. The site was launched by Alki David, born May 23,1968.  David hails from the wealthy family David-Leventis group. There is an ongoing debate as to where David got the idea for this new creative style of online community.

Battlecam is owned by parent company FilmOn.com [http://www.filmon.com].  FilmOn provides movies and tv and is being sued by major corporations for copyright infringement.  David has made a youtube video blasting CBS for profiting from piracy [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/thr-esq/filmons-alki-david-challenges-cbs-62052#comments] themselves.  Once posted on hollywoodreporter, those users comments are biased as hell.  PimpinGimp and mariana are personal friends of Mr. David on battlecam. PimpinGimp moderates the chat channel and mariana has competed for and won money in "challenges".  Such money is paid for stunts like :  pissing on a friend, shitting on your bathroom floor and writing battlecam in it, hiding a webcam so the guy could fuck an unsuspecting lady and earn money for getting her in bed. ( this stunt was canceled because of a law violating  the young ladies rights.

The site isn't complete without a daily blog written about it called ManginaInc. [http://manginainc.blogspot.com]  JTVNEWS ( jealous cunt ) is the editor and chief reporter. If you missed a day or two on battlecam you can always log into ManginaInc and catch up with the latest, news, roomers and suspicious activity.

The site is failing big time because of David appointing battlecamlily to the paid position of admin.  Her real name is Janet Stano. A recent campaign was launched to have her removed but Alki Davids live-in lover is also Jennifer Stano. 

Warning: Entering battlecam lowers the IQ level even more.  Once there you'll find everyone sitting and waiting so someone new cam come on and get screamed at. These chickenshits, sometimes wait for hours, so they don't have to rage on one of their own.  We've seen it all on cam.  Niggers, cross dressing trannies, alcoholism and people setting themselves on fire. We see faggots of every age category trying to turn the next straight guy they've seen as gay as they are.  Battlecam rules forbid children but if you are 16 or 17 and alki takes a shining to you, then you are in !  He'll tell all the mods you are ok and you are ban free. We've seen people cam up and get paid to have a hooker give them their very first blow job, all paid for by alki david. Showing tits is always a money earner.  Most stupid sluts show them for free rather than keep those puppies in and earn some bucks.
