Taxes
[[Image:Tax14.jpg|thumb|175px|Preparing for the Rape to come.]]
'''Taxes''' are a financial charge or levy on an individual or legal entity designed to support [[Dan Bailey|infrastructure projects,]] [[Government|government agencies,]] and [[Nigra|negros.]]  Taxes penalize those who work by taking their stuff and giving it to people who don’t work.  Taxes, along with [[Death]] are the only two certainties in life, unless you are [[Gay|gay]] which means that the third certainty of life is [[Aids]] and is a precursor to [[Death]].

=='''History'''==

'''To Tax''' comes from the [[Latin]] root word '''''“tangere”''''' which means to [[Buttsecks|anally rape]] with a chainsaw.   Nobody is quite sure who started this form of [[Theft|theft,]] but many scholars believe that taxes were initially invented by the [[Egypt|Egyptians]] around [[Last Thursday|3000 BC.]]  It went something like this:

*''' Pharaoh needs new pyramid or monument built.'''

*''' Pharaoh sends out his [[Slavery|minions]] to collect money for monument.'''

*''' Pharaoh’s subjects give money to the minions.  Those who refuse to pay are beaten and robbed anyways.  Those without anything to give are either placed in [[Prison|prison]] or made into [[BDSM|slaves.]]  Not all taxes, especially back then, were in the form of money, mostly it was in the form of grain, farm animals, or [[Fellatio|blow jobs.]]'''

*''' Pharaoh combines all of the [[Looting|loot]] into a big pile, takes his cut, then shares it out amongst his friends.  Some of the [[Booty|booty]] is used to make the pyramid.'''

=='''Purpose'''==

{{quote|When there's a single thief, it's robbery.  When there are a thousand thieves, it's taxation.|Old, but wise saying}}

Taxation has four main purposes, these are [[Rape|Revenue,]] [[Rape|Redistribution,]] [[Rape|Repricing,]] and [[Rape|Representation.]]  None of these purposes matter much considering the fact that all of it is [[Communism|redistributed]] to some non-working fuck who lays around on his couch watching television all day on your dime.  

=='''Types of Taxation'''==

[[Image:Tax2.jpg|thumb|175px|1040 form.  License to raep.]]
[[Image:Tax3.JPG|thumb|175px|1040EZ form.  Its for those who are poor and want money back.]]

{{quote|Taxation with representation ain't so hot either.|Another wise old saying.}}

There are two main types of taxation.  One is direct tax, which means you have to pay a set amount every year.  The other type of taxation is indirect tax, which is when they rape you when you go to buy a [[Smoking|pack of cigarettes.]]

[[Rape|In fact, there really aren't two different types of tax and this whole page should just re-direct to rape anyways, because that is what taxes are.  Rape.]]

=='''How Taxes Effect You'''==
[[image:penny.jpg|thumb|175px|couple hundred more of these and I can get a beavertail]]
[[image:Stephenharper 5percent.jpeg|thumb|175px|HOLY SHIT!!!111!!! you are god!]]
[[Image:Tax17.jpg|thumb|175px|Welfare mothers, angry about tax cuts]]
[[Image:Tax4.jpg|thumb|175px|Americans spend 4 months of the year earning money to pay taxes...and 4 months of looking at this guy.]]

{{quote|The taxpayer - that's someone who works for the federal government but doesn't have to take the civil service examination.|Ronald Reagan - noted tax expert}}

Since you are the [[Poor|low man on the taxation totem pole,]] you, and your peers, are the only ones who are effected by taxation.  When a tax is levied against a [[Business|business,]] they just [[Inflation art|raise]] their pricing to defer the money that they are losing.  If that does not work and the company is still not making money, they then go and lower the amount of money they pay out to their employees.  Finally, if that still doesn’t work, the employer will lower the benefits that employees receive to further cut their tax cost. 

[[Bum|Even if you do not work,]] this still effects you.  Since you have to go out and buy products or services, now you have to deal with the employees of taxed companies.  Since they are pretty much [[Anger|pissed off]] about their lack of wages and benefits, you get shitty service and higher prices.

If, you happen to be lucky enough to be [[Money#Riches|rich,]] you support [[Teenmommies|everybody.]], and your [[Tony_Blair|leader]] who claims to support the working class like a good left-winger can buy his third house.

=='''Taxes in [[Canada]]'''==

In the great land of [[Canada]], [[shit nobody cares about|the two types of taxes are the goods and services tax (gst) plus the provincial sales tax (pst), combined into the wonder all in one Harmonized sales tax( Hst).]]  For years the rate for the gst was a standard 7% , but then cowboy harper stepped in and lowered it to 6% and then 5%. MOST people would be happy over this, however since the change, the rate for New Brunswick went from 15% to 13%, making use of millions of more pennies every year and pissing off people when they empty out their pockets. Thanks

=='''Ethical Basis for Taxes'''==

{{quote|Did you ever notice that when you put the words "The" and "IRS" together, it spells "THEIRS?"|Yet another wise old saying}}

The [[assholes|people]] who [[Evil|make up the tax laws]] and then carry them out make a case that taxes are ethical as they are used for the public good.  


'''Examples of how some of the 2008 Tax Monies are being used:'''

*[[Bridge to Nowhere]], Alaska: 2 million dollars

*Big Dig Project, [[Massachusetts]]: 14.6 billion dollars to build a 3.5 mile tunnel

*7.5 million dollars spent on [[Alcohol|wine]] research

*5.5 million for people to visit farms in [[Ohio]].  Was termed “Innovative Food Technology”

*14 million dollars to research pasture land in [[Mormon|Utah]]

*4.6 million dollars to “increase the public image of [[Alcohol|beer”]] by the National Hops Institute

*1.7 million dollars given to the Ben Franklin Turkey fund…they still want to make the national bird the [[Turkey]] and get rid of the Bald Eagle.

=='''Tax Software'''==

{{quote|I have been really sick. When turbo tax sent my 3rd rejection notice I just sat and cried, not only about the money I lost but I could not get any help from anyone.|Merl of Ainsworth NE}}

There are [[Almost raped|many ways to file taxes]] via the [[Internets|internet]] or by using various [[Warez|software.]]  However, when the United States Secretary of the Treasury, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_F._Geithner#Tax_problems/ Tim Geitner,] cannot file his own taxes with TurboTax, and even ends up under investigation, you can see how [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/0/03/Helpful_cat.jpg/ helpful] these programs and websites actually are to the [[Fucktard|average taxpayer.]]

'''Here is a list of popular tax software websites that look like they were designed by the same people who make porn websites.  On these links, you will be able to [[Pirate Bay|find tax software to do your taxes.]]'''  <---or you could just click that link, hint hint.

*'''[http://turbotax.intuit.com/ TurboTax is probably the most popular, and most problematic.]'''
*'''[http://www.hrblock.com/ HR Block's website...where you are greeted with a happy, smiling face...as they rip you off.]'''
*'''[http://www.taxact.com/ TaxAct, where you can e-file for free...what they don't tell you is that it works only half the time.]'''
*'''[http://www.taxslayer.com/ TAX SLAYER ROCK ON!!!]'''
*'''[http://www.taxbrain.com/ TaxBrain - which is the most expensive of all of the e-filers, and it gets the second worse grade.]'''

While all of these programs do [[Redundant|just about the same thing,]] they are all prone to their own foibles.  Sometimes the user is better off just not paying their taxes at all rather than to put up with the hoops they have to jump through.  

'''Here are some negative testimonials:'''

{{squote|Turbo Tax has advertised $29.95 to file state, I filed both Fed and State, was returned twice with no reason, I submtted it a 3rd time, was approved, but than I charged additional $34.95 for re filing. I never changed anything the 4 times it was submitted.|Jaime commenting on TurboTax}}

{{squote|I paid $59.95 for the Deluxe verion with free efile. Sure, the efile was free but they charged me $29.95 to process my refund through Santa Barbara Bank!|Dorothy, commenting on TurboTax}}

{{squote|the worse part about turbo tax is that there is no way to get in contact with them. no number to call reach a person to to talk to or anything, to me that is messed up. i have to mail all of my paperwork to the IRS even though i had already paid turbo tax my fee for using their services.|Jeymi, another disgruntled user}}

{{squote|DO NOT USE TURBO TAX ONLINE! I am VERY disenchanted with this service. The free e-filing isn't free!! I feel as though I've been nickeled and dimed by this company.|Amanda, who filed online}}

{{squote|I spent $50 for a product that doesn't work.|David, who, despite being cool, doesn't use TAX SLAYER any more}}

=='''Taxes Around the Internet'''==

There are several web [[Forum|messageboards]] dedicated to helping taxpayers and to giving out free information regarding tax laws.  The main problem with this is that [[Idiot|anybody]] can jump online at the local library and ask the most idiotic questions imaginable. Here are some of those web messageboards:
