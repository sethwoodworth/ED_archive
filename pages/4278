Since the beginning of time, people that are forced to live near each other have been bitching about one thing or another, ratcheting up the [[violence]], and finally taking things too far.  Most of the time an outsider looking in can get a few cheap laughs off of the sniping and the quipping, but when you add the [[internet]], Huntington’s disease, a pickup truck painted like a hearse, and a coffin in the front yard, things go from ordinary lulz to spectacular [[rage]] within the blink of an eye.  

The feud in question, between '''Jennifer Lynn Petkov''' and the family of Kathleen Edward reached new highs (or lows, depending on how you look at it) when Jennifer made a [[Facebook]] page that had some images of the girl in the arms of a skulled death figure and also an image showing Kathleen as the skull between two crossbones.  While most of the time, it should be frowned upon when a grown woman harasses a 7 year old girl who is dying of a brain eating disease, this special case should warn everybody about knee-jerk reactions and the freedom of speech. Also, an inexplicably sudden outbreak of [[White Knighting|human emotion]] has set the world on a mission to defend this girl from her zany neighbor.


==History==

Evidently the boring stuff started a while back when somebody wasn’t invited to a birthday party.  However, since nobody cares about the inane bullshit, we can skip over that part pretty quickly.  Yes, the cops have come out to visit the Petkov's house more than once, but that only adds fuel to the fire as they have been served restraining orders to keep away from the Edward family.  Good job, they'll just take their trolling to the internet! Focus on the fact that it is two bitches and their husbands who are mad at each other for stupid reasons and everything will fit into the big picture.  Then, remember that a kid who is dying is also involved, and her mother succumbed to Hutchinson's disease a year ago.

Just because you have the freedom of speech here in America, that doesn’t always mean you should use it.  Jennifer is an out and out white-trash idiot who actually told a camera crew that she was glad she made the Facebook page.  She also further raged members of the internet by acting like a cruel asshole.

{{quote|Personal satisfaction…cuz it rubs her ass raw…it burns her ass raw for me to make fun of her dead daughter on that page.|Jennifer in front of the cameras}}

After that little spout, she was then told that what she was saying “sounded sick.”  Her only reply was for everybody to “take it or leave it.”  While she was being interviewed, officers from the Trenton, Michigan police department showed up and entered the Petkov home.  Why?  Were they looking for a Huntington’s disease rifle that fires pure sickness?

What is really worrying is the fact that many people in the neighborhood and on the internet seem to think that making an evil Facebook page and parking a shitty pickup truck in your front yard constitutes a crime.  On several occasions, people can be found asking “Have charges been filed yet?” As if speaking your mind in public is now a punishable offense in America.  While it is not, at this writing, against the law to do such things, it should be against the law to be as moronically stupid as Jennifer.  

In any event, owning a truck and coffin that scares a child doesn't fall under protected speech, and the Petkovs have been served a personal protection order.

==Apology==

Amazingly, after all of this crap, Jennifer’s husband offered an apology—but only after the house had been egged.  One can only imagine the scene inside the house once the couple realized that they had been vandalized:  

:'''Jennifer in harpy mode:'''  “Git out thar and clean them aigs up offen my vinyl sidin.”
:'''Husband in browbeaten mode:''' “okay.”
:'''Jennifer in harpy mode:''' “An when ye git done, get back on that facebook and tell errybody yer sorry.”
:'''Husband:'''  “But I ain’t”
:'''Jennifer in harpy mode:''' “I knows ye ain’t, but ye just gotta tell errybody that…it’s called PUBIC RELASHUNS.”
:'''Husband:''' “p-p-pubic ruh ruh ruh, sheet, I caint say them words…”
:'''Jennifer in harpy mode:''' “Nevermind, just get them aigs cleaned up and I’ll type this apology thing up fer you to sign later…”

In reality, here is the public apology that was issued:

{{quote|If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't do it, and to that little girl, I apologize if you've been hurt. There's not much more I can say. And hopefully we can live our lives peacefully from now on.|Sincere? I think not.}}

Also, the hen-pecked wimp husband added:

{{quote|We apologize for our actions and stupidity.  It was an ignorant thing that we did and it was basically in retaliation about things that were said about my house and my wife.}}

==Quotes==
{{quote|I wouldn’t kick her out of bed for harassing a 7-year-old girl with a degenerative brain condition.|[[You]].}}
There really isn’t a need for a quotes section on this subject as just about everybody in the world wants to string this bitch up in a lynch mob that spans five continents.   Lots of teen boys (see also:  [[Nerd|Internet Losers]]) also seem to want to punch her in the face.  But to satisfy the internet and its incredible desire to hear people scream profanities at each other, here is a small sampling of the [[Rage]] that is being spewed on yet another [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jennifer-Lynn-Petkov-Burnett-is-Downriver-Trash/154072637966872?v=wall Facebook page]:

|I have never in my life seen such a sick ass bitch!!!!!!!!! I look at her and I wish I could just punch her in the face for being so damn mean and hurtful.I wonder what that family could of ever done to deserve to be treated like this? How must Jennifers parents and family cope with the hell she is raising?|From the Downriver Trash Facebook.

|I hope that the Trenton DHS has been alerted so that any minor children in the home can be taken away from this animal. Is it me or could she be Anne Coulter's twin sister?! She may be a famewhore, but it's really getting turned around back onto her, isn't it? She really should hire some private security, because mo...re than a few people will try to kill her...I hope they get away with it!|Downriver Trash

|I'm convincing myself that all this bs is a publicity scam to help raise $ for the little girl... |Oh shit, somebody got smart!

|Seriously. I have pissed off people before... But I have never pissed off most of the western world. WOW. congratulations for that.|WOW
