'''''Final Fantasy VI''''' is a [[video game]] released for the [[Super Nintendo|Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] [[at least 100 years ago|around 100 years ago]]. The game was released as ''Final Fantasy III'' in North America because [[shit nobody cares about|Square was having issues with Nintendo at the time]]. These issues would eventually reach critical mass and result in Square being told to GB2KITCHEN, making FF3/6 the last ''Final Fantasy'' game to appear on a Nintendo console. The game is often heralded as being the one of best of the series, along with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', but that really just makes it the [[shit|log that tops the pile]]. As this is the case, fans of FF3/6 and FF7 have engaged in a pissing contest between each other in a mad dash to eat the shit sandwich.

Fans of FF3/6 are generally [[old school]] Nintendo [[fanboys]] and [[Oxymoron|non-conformist conformist]] fanatics who claim it's the best in the series. They're unable to get over the fact FFVII was a way more popular game and threw their little J-RPG game series into mainstream culture, making it [[shitty|cool]] to like ''Final Fantasy'' instead of being an obscure favorite of [[Unwarranted_self-importance|self-important]] video game fans. As their insults and flames usually boil down to "Cloud is a pussy", "[[Sephiroth]] is a [[your mom|momma]]'s boy", and "At least VI has a complete story!", they usually fail to realize that every ''Final Fantasy'' is a ripoff of every other ''Final Fantasy'' before it as per Square's staple production code of rehashing everything in the series. 

FF7 fans, in response to this trolling, intelligently and politely articulate their objections to FF3/6 with the following:

[[bullshit|TEH GRAFIX SUX CUZ TEHY AREN'T 3D U STOOPID CUNT!]]

==Story==
===World of Balance===
In the world of balance, the grass is green except for the desert area and the water is blue, however, anywhere you walk, you get attacked by [[Bipolar|scary monsters]], Just like IRL. A rather uninspirational flutist follows [[you]] around playing his music all the while. There are a bunch of really small towns with like five people that only sell useless [[shit]] like [[women|shields]] and [[drugs|tonic]]. When was the last time [[you]] bought a tonic? Every now and again the [[army|Imperial Army]] occupies the town and their band plays some really [[crap]]py sad music.

The story follows a [[Star Wars|group of rebels as they take on an evil empire]], who plan on taking over the world. The main protagonist of the story is '''Terra''', who [[I'm so confused|can't decide]] which side to fight for. Unlike everyone else, she can [[Wicca|use magic]]. However, the only spells she can cast are [[kill it with fire|Fire]] and [[meth|Cure]], which makes her completely fucking useless. Also, when you find [[furry|Espers]], you can give other characters magic, too.

There's also the [[bullshit|infamous]] Opera scene which makes fanboys gush out cum. This however, is clearly overshadowed by the fact that a [[Ultros|pun spewing octopus]] is planning to drop a 5 ton anvil onto the stage for [[lulz|"revenge"]].

The main villain is '''Kefka''', a [[drugs|retarded]] [[Joker|clown]] [[faggot]] who acts as an Imperial general. Halfway into the game he [[insane|goes batshit crazy]], becomes a [[god]] and [[Delete_fucking_everything|ends the world]].

===World of Ruin===
The main character after the [[Apocalypse]] is '''Celes'''. She spends most of her time trying to be [[an hero]] and getting the group back together by going on pointless side-quests like helping [[Old|Strago]] hunt and kill some monster, [[Alcoholic|Setzer]] work through his [[Shit nobody cares about|gambling issues]], and [[Looting|Locke]] to [[Necrophilia|get over his dead girlfriend]]. You also need to [[Chris Hansen|confront]] Cyan on his [[jail bait|stalking]] and battle The Three Stooges. This half of the game is noticeably shittier than the first half, though for some reason everyone pretends not to notice. Also apparently Sabin spent most of his time after the apocalypse working as a column for housing.

After all the personal drama, the team goes and fights Kefka, who's still busy abusing his [[god]] powers.

==Playable Characters==
''Final Fantasy VI'' has a cast of [[at least 100]] playable characters, making it the largest RPG in recorded history. The characters are mostly human, but there's also a [[furry|Moogle]], an ambiguous clown, and a Wookiee.

===Biggs & Wedge===
Two faggots who parade around with [[fanboy|Terra]] in the beginning of [[the game]]. They get chased around by [[lolwut|robots and dogs]] until they get killed by some [[magnets|fuckin miracle]]. These guys are in every [[Final Fantasy]] game as some [[Luser|useless]] [[Weegee|minor character]].

===Terra===
[[Image:Terra Branford alt skirt.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Fanboys]] rejoiced when Terra appeared in [[Super Smash Bros.|Dissidia]] as a playable character.]]
The aforementioned green-haired chick who starts out as the game's main character. About a quarter of the way through the game you learn that her dad is a [[furry]] and her mom has a [[your mom|dog]] fetish. They even show Terra being conceived in stunning 2D sprite detail. After this revelation, she can turn into [[LOL WUT|Marilyn Manson by shouting, "It's showtime synergy!"]] This ability, however, is rarely used due to the fact that it can only be activated less than 100 times. Players hoard the uses of the transform ability until the end of the game, when it is no longer useful because everyone does [[over 9,000]] damage with every spell or attack anyway.
She goes through the story unsure if she can ever [[sex|love]] because she had her brains [[rape]]d out by Kefka's [[cock ring|slave crown]]. Later she finds out she [[necrophilia|loves some dead guy named General Leo]].

===Locke===
Shady fucker who deals in stolen goods. With the shit he sells, you be hard pressed to find a DVD player that would work. And just to show you how great of a chap he is, he will follow you quietly home, and take anything not bolted to the ground...and that's if you don't wake up. He'd beat you over the head  with the broken DVD player he sold you. He has a dead girlfriend in the [[midget|tiny]] town of Kohlingen (in perfect mint-condition, if I may add) which someday he will go to and [[Rape|COMPLETELY FUCK HER BRAINS OUT!!!1!3-2111!!1!ein1!one1!!]] (Hey, she was [[asking for it]].) He "helps" Terra in the beginning of the game but tries to rape Celes later on when he sees DAT ASS.

===Celes===
Was a General in the [[Army|Imperial Army]] until she was dishonorably discharged because of the [[Homosexuality|Don't Ask/Don't Tell]] policy and erotically chained up and [[rape]]d by several [[perverts|grunts]]. '''Locke''' found her chained up in a dungeon and [[rape|cheated on his dead girlfriend]] by pounding her mercilessly. Later on she decides that the [[rape]] was quite enjoyable and gives up her militant lesbianism to be with '''Locke''', who is still all [[emo]] about his dead girlfriend.

===Shadow===
A badass motherfucker with a really cool [[furry|dog]]. In the game, it is stated that he black person, showing how [[cool|badass]] and unemotional he is. When Kefka ends the world, you have the choice to either wait for him and save him when escaping, or simply to leave him to die. (However, [[RAGE|you're not notified whatsoever.]]) [[Over 9,000]] fanboys restarted their files to save him after they found out you can in fact keep him in the game. His role in combat is to use very weak physical attacks and chuck shit at the enemy that comes OUT OF YOUR INVENTORY. Spoiler, he's Relm's father.

[[Image:Shadow Rage.png|thumb|Fucking ninja...]].

===Edgar===
A huge [[faggot]] that uses the same weapons and armor as every female character in the game, making him a [[metrosexual]]. In order to hide his blatant sexual issues Edgar decides to [[pedophile|hump everything that moves]], thus affirming the fact that [[M00t|gay men get more pussy]]. Since the game developers had [[Stupid|ran out of original shit]] for people to do, they decided to give him a [[BDSM|variety of tools]] and [[circle_jerk|call it a day]].

===Sabin===
PROTIP: "Sabin" is pronounced "Say-Bihn" (sry Mash-bashers).

<s>Edgar's infinitely [[moar]] badass brother and all-around [[pretty cool guy]] and the producer of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, for he uses fists to lay down [[butthurt]] onto foes [[pretty cool guy|AND DOESN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING]]. He uses [[BDSM|claws]]. He's like a motherfucking [[ninja]]. He even has a really kickass move called Blitz. And if you press down, down, left in that order after choosing Blitz, he can [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|shoop da woop]] enemies, adding man points and [[win]] to his stats. And to even add moar to his badassness, he can equip shields and NOT have his attack decrease, making him the first monk in ''Final Fantasy'' [[evar]] to pull such a feat. Sabin makes everyone else in the ''Final Fantasy'' series look like a bunch of cocksuckers, thanks to his manly jaw, Mohawk, and the fact that he uses ''Street Fighter'' attacks instead of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' bullshit. His name was Mash in [[Japanese|Moonspeak]], mostly because the Japanese are MASH fans.</s>

Main combat role: He has an attack called [[buttsex|Bum Rush]], that's all you need to know.

===Cyan=== 

A Duncan McLeod wanna-be who looks a lot like [[Borat]]. He loses his family and [[Dead Friend|friends]] over the course of the game, which makes him wig out, desperately trying to be [[an hero]].

He can use samurai swords and a special attack called "SwordTech", but you must [[retarded|use a meter to make it work, but that takes a long time to load, which sucks]].

His role in combat is to die, because his attacks take too long and like every other character except Sabin and Terra, his melee attack sucks horribly.

His name in the Japanese game was Cayenne which suggests a certain level of [[hot|spiciness]] however, the English version of Cyan, is much more accurate as it reflects that his character is actually quite [[emo|blue]] about his misfortune.

===Setzer===
A batshit insane [[meth]]-addict with a gambling addiction; he rides around in a HUEG airship crying about his transvestite lover pulling a [[Mitch Henderson]]. His weapons are retarded shit like [[Yu Gi Oh|playing cards]] and darts, and he does fuck all damage with them. 

His [[Retarded|special]] ability is <s>"sluts"</s> "slots", where either you summon two chickens to do about 13 damage to the enemy, or you fail at getting three in a row because it's stupidly fucking hard and summon an AZN rabbit who promptly shits itself and disappears.

===Gau===
A 14-year old [[furry]] who, raised by [[your mom|monsters]], can only speak in stunted English - [[yiff|yelps and grunts]]. To this day, no one has used Gau for any length of time, so his abilities are still a mystery. But he seems to [[rape]] animals then show up as a furry with some new moves. He is useless as fuck in all combat situations as you have no control over his abilities; meaning he will spam fire spells on enemies that are healed by fire and stupid crap to that effect.

'''UPDATE:''' [[Internet detective|Our spies]] have determined what Gau's abilities are. Most of them [[suck]], but if he thusly rapes some stray [[cat]]s, he'll [[castration|declaw]] them (presumably [[guro|the hard way]]) and then [[pwn|kill people]] by [[BSDM|scratching them]] with the claws. This move is, [[retarded|creatively]], named ''Catscratch''.

===Strago===
An aging punk rocker. If you went on a side quest, you'd get his ultimate attack, [[Mantrain]]. Unfortunately, nobody fucking uses him because he is a [[Plagiarism|Blue Mage]]. Basically, you have to learn his Blue Magic skillz by finding a [[rapist|random monster]] to [[rape|attack you.]] During the battle, you need to wait for the monster to use a Blue Magic spell, but that may take fucking forever due to...

A) The monster might be VERRRRY FUCKING RARE.

B) It might take [[at least 100 years]] for it to use its Blue Magic attack.

Square Enix later admitted that the only reason why Strago, like all other Blue Mages, exists is because they needed [[lulz]] knowing that gamers will become [[insane|batshit insane]] from all the frustration. It is [[rumor]]ed that this is what called [[Cho Seung Hui]] to go on his [[VTEC Just Kicked In Yo|rampage at Virginia Tech]].

===Relm===
Shadow's  child (obviously a typical thing a [[black]] man would have, amirite?), she can [[photoshop]] compromising images of her enemies and use them for blackmail. <s> Noted for being the only young girl depicted in Japanese media not subjected to fans' rampant [[lolita]] complexes). This is quite possibly due to the fact that she [[Terrorist|wears a turban]] and her main attack is to [[emo|draw things]] and then write about it in her LiveJournal, boring her opponent until they decide to [[An_hero|slit their wrists]].</s>
(http://moe.imouto.org/post/show/68278/hentai-final_fantasy-final_fantasy_vi-naked-nipple [[rule 34]] no exceptions).

Her role in combat is to be a less powerful caster than Terra and Celes, making her totally useless.

===Mog===
[[furry|Small white mammal]]. Knows English. (Sort of.) His main role in the party is to use awesome dance attacks on trash, then spend entire boss fights stumbling.

===Umaro===
Huge black person that is fucking useless because you can't even control him in battle. His special move: Throw [[shit]]. But even that crap won't do [[massive damage]], only [[at least 100]] (Which is [[fuck]]ing retarded, for, at that time . . . even [[emo|Terra]] - a freaking [[camwhore|mage]] - can do [[over 9000|over 9000]] damage.) 

He also has a move where he [[rape|leaps]] towards the opponent dealing over 9,100 damage. He never uses this, and instead throws [[moar]] shit.

He is also Mog's [[prostitute|sex slave]].

===[[transvestite|Gogo]]===
Judging by the fact that this character's introductory text is expressly devoted to pointing out that "his" gender is unknown, Gogo is likely to be either a eunuch or a [[hermaphrodite]]. Gogo has the remarkable, completely unheard of, and challenging-to-master ability to copy the actions of others, such as cheating on a test. [[Some argue]] that this is [[LOL WUT|Setzer's dead girlfriend due to Gogo being found at the same place she was buried]], but pulling a "he's/she's not really dead trick" would be pulling off the same trick Sega used in [[Sonic]]-Next Gen, which was [[gay]] and [[fail]], [[amirite]]?

==Other Important Characters==

===Kefka===
[[Image:Dont_MessWithKefka.GIF|right|thumb|ZOMG, [[lie|Im so scared!!!1!1!111!!!]] ]]
Kills as many people as possible.  Has a [[orgasm|lollergasm]] after he poisons an entire town, and is responsible for the [[lollercaust]] that ends the world. Kefka's fans hold a [[butthurt|rabid hatred]] for Sephiroth and his fans, just because they think a [[sick fuck|batshit insane clown]] is better than a long-haired [[fag]] in black with a 20-foot sword. He is most known for being the worst idea for an enemy and yet the first enemy to be good at his job. On top of all that, he has a massive [[laser]] at his command, where he torches entire towns for the lulz. He wins points simply for the fact that he's one of the few villains to actually commit a [[holocaust|war crime]] in any game. Not just RPGs, ANY game.

Kefka appears again in the 2008 film [[The Dark Knight]], inexplicably lacking any connection to The Empire, and motivated by an almost supernatural insanity rather than the fact that [[the game]] needed a protagonist.

===Cid===
Wears a yellow labcoat, making him resemble a banana.  Has a [[creepy|weird]] [[parents|daddy]] thing going on with Celes.  He dies when she feeds him tainted fish. In fact, just kill the mutherfucker. You'll get off the damn island faster, plus Celes gets [[attention whore|emo]] and almost [[suicide|kills herself]] in the process. Letting the spermcoat live only proves you have wasted an hour for NOTHING!

===Banon===
The apparent leader of the Returners. Banon is [[fat]] and [[old]] and doesn't do much in the way of usefulness. He does, however, have a [[Wisebeardman|fantastic beard]]. It is big and bushy and [[win|grows towards the sun]]. He used to have a thing for [[your dad|Edgar's dad]] before he kicked the bucket. He [[fap|masturbates]] a lot but if he does it too much and dies, your entire party dies.... How fucking [[gay]] is that?

===Arvis===
[[Old]] man in Narshe. He thinks Locke is an asshole, but supports the Returners anyway. A closeted homosexual, he secretly lusts after Banon, who is too busy cutting back his beard to notice.

===Gestahl===
The Emperor of the Empire. Kefka kills him later, but it's okay because he was [[asking for it|backtalking like a little bitch]].
Also resembles a dog.

===Leo===
Leo's just a [[nice guy]]. He gets along well with others, is [[gay|diplomatic]], [[gay|loyal]], and [[lol|brave]]. Terra has a [[LOL WUT|crush on him]]. He gets [[owned]] by Kefka and has the tiniest funeral ever. After that, no one gives the tiniest piece of shit about him, except the people who trick n00bs into believing that he can be revived.

===Rachel===
Locke's dead girlfriend. He fucked up and [[fail|left Kohlingen after she lost all of her memories]], and she died when the Empire attacked the town. Later she is [[necrophilia|brought back to life by an Esper]], but it was fucking useless because she only stayed alive long enough to tell Locke to stop being [[emo]]. Then she died again.

===Owzer===
A [[fat]] [[bastard]] who owns the art gallery in Jidoor. He [[almost raped|kidnapped]] Relm in the WoR after Kefka went [[insane]], but Celes and the rest of the party saved her by having an [[orgy]] with him.

===Maduin and Madeline===
Terra's [[parents]]. Madeline (called [[camwhore|Madonna]] in the [[fail|original SNES version]]) is a closet [[furry]]. After she did Maduin, she got [[lol|knocked up]]. She's fucking stupid because really the whole fucking game is Terra's fault, which makes it HER fault for getting preggers to begin with.

===[[Ultros]]===
Octopus royalty, and one of the most bad-ass characters in all of existence, almost to the point of RPG Captain Falcon. A fan of the opera. He prides himself on [[retard]]ed puns like [[pwnd|"Ouch, Seafood soup!"]]. Began stand-up on /v/ after he received his final paycheck from Square.

===The Impressario===
Important (just not enough to be given an actual name) in that he shacks up with the morbidly obese [[gay|Owzer]] and runs the opera house south of Jidoor. This results in a fucktarded plot line where he takes Celes into his ho-stable, is fine with her being crushed to death by [[Ultros]] as long as it doesn't interrupt his show, and plans to have her abducted and raped by Setzer instead of his main bitch, [[prostitute|Maria]] (the beautiful, pampered opera diva who the rough edged, hard-bitten General Celes is conveniently identical to). It's all good, though, as this allows you to scam Setzer out of both his airship and bodily safety.
