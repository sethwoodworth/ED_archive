"'''I'm so confused'''" or rather "''I'm [[like]], soooooooooooooooo confused''" is a common [[Attention whore|attention whoring]] tactic used by [[16 year old girl|all teenage girls]]  and [[Gay|gays]] [[Over 9000|over 9000 times]] in an internet year.  It is used and abused as a lame way to excuse their violently stupid behavior or misunderstanding of the most simple of concepts, such as meaning what you say and saying what you mean. In other words, it is the perfect statement for girls who just have to have it both ways; it's a way to ask a stupid (or [[PROTIP|painfully obvious]]) question without the guilt of admitting that they're a fucking retard. Many cases of "[[fucktard|confusion]]" surround pregnancy issues, resulting mostly in [[teen mothers]].

===Examples:===

*"Guys, I'm [[like]] so tired and unhealthy. I've been like trying to lose some weight, so I [[Pro-ana|eat about 500 calories a day]]. What should I do? I'm sooooooo confused!"

*"I need $100 more to buy food for my babies, but I spent the last of my [[Welfare|money]] to buy the new Gucci purse! What should I do? I'm SOOOOOO confused!!!"

*"My teacher forces me to have sex with him after class, and I can't say no, or go to the police because he said if I do, he says that he will fail me!!  WHAT DO I DO??? I'm soooo confused!"

*"My BF and I did it w/o a condom and he [[POS|pulled out]] but now I'm all fat and I haven't had my period in like eight months!  Could I be [[amipregnant|pregnate]]?! im soooooooooooo confused!!!"

*"I was, [[like]], on the internet, and, [[like]], this thing came up that said I won a laptop, and I clicked it, and I put in [[dox|my name, address, phone number, PIN number, credit card number, social security number, and, like, my Windows CD key]], and like, now, my computer doesn't worrrrk.  Where's my laptop??? I'm, [[like]], sooooo confused, guys!!"

*[[Nice Guy|"Guys, my only friend is about to leave me because I treat him like shit and only talk to my boyfriend who lives in another country. What should I do? I'm sooooooooo confused!"]]

*[[Almost raped|"My boyfriend and I started getting serious, and he put his hand up my shirt.  Now everyone will think I'm a slut!  I'm soooooo confused!"]]

*[[Rick Roll|"Guys guys! i think i have a crush on rick astley is that normal? im not sure im soooooo confused!"]]

Dear Agony Aunts,



This is going to sound so crazy...and I am completely embarassed to ask it but...Well, here it goes. My boyfriend and have been dating for almost a year now and we are very much in love...Also, he and I are highly sexually active. He has been more sexually active with me than any of his past relationships and visa versa...The thing is...I can't believe I'm asking this...He likes me to pee on him!!!!It started out on his feet,then his back and now.......his face.......He never likes to do it to me. Just me to him. I asked him about it but all he said was that anything coming out of me was hot....What does this mean about the way he feels about me? 

Why does he like me to do this?!?!?!?! I'm so confused!
