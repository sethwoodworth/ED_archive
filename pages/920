'''Ben Schumin''' is the dorky little brother of the [[Internet]] -- he was one of the first idiots to [[spam]] his every [[dumb]] thought all over the [[Internet]].  He has now grown up to be a fat, bald loser who got fired from [[Wal-Mart]] before finding a job at a [[Communist|non-profit]], [http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/journal/permalink.php?id=1295 packin' boxes and suckin' dick].  This qualifies him for an admin position at [[TOW]], which, sure enough, he is.

=How It All Began=

[[Image:SchuminOnSantasLap.jpg|thumb|[[Buttsecks]] FTW]]

Ben Schumin started out life as a [[Assburger|normal child]], although there were [http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/odds-and-ends/childhood-1.php early indications of later insanity]:

* [http://www.schuminweb.com/images/odds-and-ends/childhood/37.jpg A family dog whose obesity foreshadowed his own later struggles with weight]
* [http://www.schuminweb.com/images/odds-and-ends/childhood/40.jpg His early urges to become a furry]
* [http://www.schuminweb.com/images/odds-and-ends/childhood/50.jpg Attendance at a so-called "fatness camp"]

All that aside, though, Ben started out life no worse than most of us.  Sure, he was a dorky kid, but we all start out as [[dorks]].  The problem is that this was absolutely the high point of his life.  After he got his brains buggered out by Santa (see photo at right), it all went to hell, and he was doomed to a life of total idiocy.

Behold his descent.

[[Image:BenSchumin1996.gif|thumb|Feast your eyes on this photo, folks, 'cause after this he gets a hell of a lot uglier.]]

At the dawn of the [[Intertubes]], Schumin was one of [[over 9000|about a million]] [[13-year-old boy|teenagers]] who managed to master [[Microsoft]] FrontPage and put up [http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/archives/original-site/index.htm a shitty AOHell webpage dedicated to themselves].

Most of those teens updated a few times, put up MIDIs of [[Heavy metal|"Iron Man"]] and backgrounds of half-[[naked]] [[chicks]], and got bored, having exhausted the potential of the Internet at that time.  ''But Ben was not most teens.''  Instead of [[sex|getting laid]] or [[drugs|high]], he proceeded to invent [[Twitter]] ''ten years before it was even created.''

How did he do this?  By posting [[shit no one cares about|his every fucking thought and dream]].  But that wasn't the worst part.  Ben managed to be boring even by the standards of Twitter accounts.

Think of the dumbest celebrity ever to have a Twitter account.  Now imagine them being forced to drink a quart of vodka and then hit in the head with a bag of rice.  That is the level of stupidity Ben brought to bear, day in and day out.

I shit you not.  The reader is spared nothing -- every aspect of the trip, from his [[ugly]] [[sister]] to each purchase (actual or merely contemplated) to testing out the blood pressure machine...''everything.''

The rest of his website was full of this kind of [[crap]].  He didn't even go [[emo]], cut himself, listen to shitty music, or any of those ''Dawson's Creek'' staples.

=The Pawn Shop Years=

[[Image:SchuminBowlsA44.jpg|thumb|Deprived of mandatory [[buttsex|phys ed classes]], Schumin is reduced to bowling a [[fail|44]]]] Ben managed to wangle his way into [http://www.jmu.edu/ a shitty wannabe university].  Even though it was a total [http://www.playboy.com/articles/top-party-schools-2009-the-works/index.html party school], Schumin ''still'' couldn't get laid.  Yes, this is the same "university" [[Chris-chan/Wikipedia#His_Early_Years_-_Birth_to_1992|that taught Chris-chan how to speak]].  Good fucking work, assholes.

College provided Ben with unparalleled opportunities to [http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/photography/photo-display.php?Folder=jmu-mission&Extension=jpg&File=06 gain three hundred pounds] and [http://college.schuminweb.com/college-life/freshman/pie.php cream all over the girls].  In fact, [http://college.schuminweb.com/ an entire section of his current website] is dedicated to his time at the university.

After [http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/journal/permalink.php?id=12 staying there for five fucking years], he allegedly graduated with a "degree" in [[bullshit|public administration]].  But it was on the Web that he was to achieve his [[loser|true potential]].

=The Colossus Expands=

[[Image:SchuminTitanicAward.gif|thumb|This award is named for the number of times Ben had to go down on the judges in order to win it.]] The Internet may have been young when Ben began his self-centered blather, but there was no way a [[lolcow]] like this could go unmilked for long.

Spinnwebe was [http://www.spinnwebe.com/stories/schumin/1.php the first to board the rich, gooey gravy train] in September of 2000, with a whole week of articles dedicated to this wonder of the postmodern age, including [[stalking|calling him in his dorm room]].

{{quote|He reads like a regular columnist in [[The Onion]].|Spinn, coming to grips with the fact of Ben Schumin}}

[[Portal of Evil]] was quick to feel the Schumomentum, dedicated [http://friends.portalofevil.com/sfs.php?fi=000004954 a whole subforum to The Thalidomide Wonder] with activity as recent as 2008.  Best of all, Schumin himself [http://friends.portalofevil.com/fshow.php?userid=2155 joined in], although he was inclined to give out [http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?si=3&fi=000004954&ti=1000457791&pi=1000458466 hypocritical advice] from time to time.

The avalanche of praise began:  [http://www.personal.triticom.com/~erm/EntertainingLinks/ a listing in "Ed's Entertaining Links"], [http://www.alleghany.info/ redneck towns putting up his YouTube vids], [http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/halloffame.html an award for his page on ocean liners], and [http://web.archive.org/web/20010408144013/http://schuminweb.com/awards.htm other recognitions] of his [[Internet celebrity|greatness]].

=The Fall=

[[Image:SchuminWhores.jpg|thumb|Ben got some whores to model his merch.]] But there is no [[fatty|giant]] so [[obese|great]] that there is not an [[army]] of [[trolls|midgets]] kicking at his heels.  Schumin, too, had to suffer fools, and in time they laid him low.  (No, he still didn't get laid.)

To some extent, his own marketing was at fault.  He made the usual attempts to extend his fifteen minutes of celebrity:  [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mecca%20switch&defid=365956 attempts to propagate catch phrases], [http://college.schuminweb.com/college-life/senior/my-room.php a shocking expose of his dorm room], [http://college.schuminweb.com/college-life/junior/online-store.php cheesy merchandising], even [http://college.schuminweb.com/college-life/senior/pyrote.php the invention of a fictional nation]  -- a tactic that [http://www.codeweek.pk/2009/08/wikipedia-fights-vandalism/ clever hoaxsters] would later use on [[Wikipedia]].

But even the most [[artfag|avant garde]] measures could not prevent the inevitable indifference that came when people found that Schumin's real interests were [[shit no one cares about|above their heads]], and eventually they moved on to [[lolcats|other, greener pastures]].

=The Great Engine Of His Mind=

What makes Ben [[erection|tick]]?

==Bus Stops==

His [http://transit.schuminweb.com/ webpage on bus stops] is one of a kind.  After all, [[welfare|bus riders]] can't afford [[bling|digital cameras]].

{{clear}}

==Fire Alarms==

[[Image:SchuminsDreamGirl.gif|thumb|100px|Hawt!]]

Schumin is [http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/odds-and-ends/fire-alarms.php the one-stop authority on fire alarms].  Not, mind you, in order to do [[Fire|awesome shit]], but just the alarms themselves.  He is probably the world's foremost expert on [[shit no one cares about|fire alarms]].  He can't design them or anything like that, but he can identify the brand and characteristics of a fire alarm at a glance.  This got him [[zero|about as much ass as you'd expect.]]

==The Price Is Right==

[http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/odds-and-ends/tecpir.php Complete with an actual re-enactment], as [[teenagers|high school students]] try to guess the price of groceries.  ''And a complete transcript.''

==Hollywood Squares==

[http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/odds-and-ends/hs-classroom.php He had people re-enact this one as well.]  ''And another complete transcript.''

==Some Fucking Canadian Children's Program==

[http://todays-special.schuminweb.com/ You only wish I was making this shit up.]

==[[Anarchy]]==

[[Image:SchuminOnymous.jpg|thumb|The mask cannot hide the [[fatty]] within.]]

Yes, Benny is a [http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/life-and-times/2007/j27-1.php black bloc] [[anarchist]].  No, he doesn't do anything [[terrorism|good]] with his knowledge of fire alarms and bus stations, although "Schumin" sounds kind of [[JEWS DID WTC|Jewish]]...well, [http://www.dhs.gov/files/reportincidents/counterterrorism.shtm you know what to do].

He also thinks he's part of [[Anonymous]], and occasionally takes part in [[Project Chanology]] events.  They use him as [[bait]] for [[homos]] and [[OM NOM NOM NOM|cannibals]].

'''ALERT:''' [[Anonymous]] has informed us that Ben is a sleeper agent for [[Scientology]].  He is to be given a blanket party at the very next anti-Scientology raid.

{{clear}}

==Himself==

Above all else, Ben [[masturbation|loves himself]].  [http://community.schuminweb.com/ His discussion forum dedicated to his favorite person ever], [http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/life-and-times/2004/wal-mart.php his continued coverage of his shopping trips at Wal-Mart], [http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/archives/quotes.php his archive of his personal quotes] -- all aspects of Schumin fascinate Schumin.

=Where Is He Now?=

[[Image:SchuminAtWork.jpg|thumb|Go to a real college, kids, or this is the shit you'll wind up doing.]]

These days, Ben spends his time as an [[admin]] at [[TOW]], which tells you just how dumb [[Wikipedos]] are.  Other than that, he works at something called [[Communism|Food and Water Watch]], which means that he hangs around the food court at local malls and steals leftovers.  He is [http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/about/who-we-are/ damn near at the bottom of the totem pole there] (scroll WAY down), and his job description means he is basically the office [[bitch]].

The lesson is simple:  [http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/journal/permalink.php?id=802 Never get fired] from [[Wal-Mart]], and never reveal the shallows of your soul on the goddamn Internet.  You will never live it down.
