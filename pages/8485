{{ytlink2|ToriBelliachi|Tori Belliachi}}, ([[powerword|Shaun Hargreaves]]) more commonly known as ''' AlexGrey'''/'''Grey Hargreaves''', also known as the [[Martin Luther King]] of the [[furry]] fandom is a bisexual [[furry]] [[drama whore]] who adamantly claims that he is non-sexual or "asexual", despite his self confessed fetishes including "[[Fat_furry|FatFur]]" being a "gainer" (someone who wants to get [[fat]]). His furry "species" is an obese fruitbat called "Blubberbat". No, really.

He goes by the name [[powerword|Shaun]] IRL and designs websites for furries in his spare time. In an effort to end the [[Youtube furry war]] of 2007, Tori posted several videos warning the public for the [[lulz|evils]] of [[fursecution]]. Compared to most [[furfags]], AlexGrey is slightly articulate and may occasionally make a good point. He gained several [[circlejerk|followers]] and [[fanboys]] in his campaign against the [[FCTC]]. He has a poster of Ch√©, which makes him a [[hipster|trendy fuck]] with no appreciation for someone that actually made a difference.

One tactic AlexGrey used against the trolls was the attempt to appear unaffected by acting happy and changing voices in Robin Williams fashion while adding a musical tone to his words. To further appear unharmed by trolling, he went on with rhetoric such as "<i>Yiff in Hell furfags</i> is not only unoriginal, but it is a compliment. So what if we're yiffing in hell. Yiffing is still having sex!" He also makes the bogus and irrelevant claim that furries get [[bullshit|laid more]] due to their open mindedness. If he means having sex with [[beastiality|dogs]] and [[homosexual|members of the same gender]] while wearing a fursuit then he is absolutely right. 
He initially claimed that he would "disprove" every claim made against furries because he is completely in denial about the kind of [[sick fucks]] that inhabit his fandom . He had such a horrible time disproving everything that he nearly burst into tears one day and finally posted a video saying that he was quitting "the war" because he was [[true|fucking useless]].

==In 2007, Tori was giving up==
<center><youtube>e0VPYo8fPfE</youtube></center>
<center>After [[at least 100]] videos, Tori says he's going to stop fighting trolls. He still makes [[faggot]] videos, but he doesn't mention "the war" as much. The lulziest thing about this one is how upset he gets toward the end. He nearly [[cry|cries]] and then he says he's some kind of [[Unwarranted self-importance|crusader for humanity.]]</center>

==Tori haets anon==
<center><youtube>fsf-2Jt5mb8</youtube></center>
<center>He says Anonymous' purpose is to [[AWESOME|"Destroy Humanity."]] Anonymous is also the [[scientology|"Scum" of the Earth.]] It great how these furfags can 
<br>bitch about [[stereotype|stereotyping]] and then refer to Anonymous as a monolithic culture. Oh well. At least he only stated the positive stereotypes. Plus, he put soul instead of sole. [[Fucktard]].</center>

==Furries are [[Not Gay]]==

==Belliachi on Chanology==
<center><youtube>1GkbDkcH2N4</youtube></center>
<center>It's pretty much [[TL;DW]]. He thinks both [[Anonymous]] and [[Scientology]] are crazy and evil, so he won't pick a side. <br>But he says Anonymous is wasting their time and that they'll [[nevar]] stop the <s>church</s> cult.</center>
<br>More: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLjFn9Z5qMQ He says 'Umm' every five seconds while talking about chanology]

== Response to this article from [[user:ToriBelliachi|Tori]]==	
This article was immediately whored out on [[Fur Affinity]] to much acclaim. His friends said it was [[crap]]. [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/355605/ Click here, my homeslice].

{{q|Well that was [[grammar|pretty crap]]... comparing me to Martin Luther King and Robin Williams is a good thing. They must like me! [[Irony|Though they really gotta work on their spelling.]]|Tori Belliachi|after reading article not acknowledging that that MLK defended people that were actually oppressed and [[Fail]]iachi is defending a bunch of perverts that fuck dogs.}}

== Recent activity ==

In recent times he has continued his fat fetish by gaining a shitload of weight by eating junkfood and candy, and has created a [[Twitter]] account for his "fat fruitbat" character. He also looks as though he's wearing a cheap joke shop wig, as he appears to be balding at an alarming rate, yet continues to sport his "Asian Teenager" facial hair.

He also no longer uses the name Tori, but almost universally uses AlexGrey or variants thereon.
