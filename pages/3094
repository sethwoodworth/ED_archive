'''Friendster''' is like [[Myspace]], making it basically a way for [[attention whore]]s to prove they have [[friend]]s. In reality, everyone who says they're your friend wouldn't hesitate to pee in your [[fro0tlo0p]]s.  Founded in 2002, Friendster was finally [http://valleywag.com/tech/facebook/caught-between-a-rock-and-a-facebook-friendsters-dilemma-190363.php#more awarded a patent] on "[[internet stalking|social networking]]" in July 2006.  Analysts say this attempt to [[pwn]] [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]] will likely fail, as [[Rupert Murdoch|rotting corpses]] are generally incapable of pwning anything unless they become [[zombie]]s. A lot of Friendster users are stupid [[Philippines|Filipinos]].

They did not have any policy, didn't give me any warning, they didn't ask me to take anything down."
