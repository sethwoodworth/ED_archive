[[LiveJournal]] [[community]] for [[Internet]] oddities, run by a shower of [[furry]] [[faggot]]s. Its [[member]]ship is dedicated to incessantly bitching about how any and all posts to the community have failed to conform to their [[Anal|anal retentive]] standards of [[netiquette]].

==The community rules==
''These are the revised posting guidelines as they existed at the time of this writing. It should be noted that the [[moderator]]s have not yet appended them to the community [[userinfo]].''
# Every post must be prefaced with a [[Dubious disclaimer|disclaimer]] such as ''"I don't know if this is [[wtf]] but..."'' or ''"Sorry if this has been [[Old meme|posted before]] but..."''.
# As long as rule 1 is upheld, informing the poster that something has been posted before or is [[Shit nobody cares about|not, in fact, wtf]] is strictly forbidden, as doing so would hurt their delicate [[E (prefix)|e]]-feelings.
# Every post consisting of an [[image]] or more than two lines of text '''MUST''' be put behind an [[LJ-cut]].
# '''Anything''' that could possibly offend anyone from the ages of three and up '''MUST''' be marked as [[NSFW]]. If something is completely inoffensive and safe, you must state that it is "possibly NSFW".
# Expressing an opinion in your post is [[NPOV|not permitted]].

Failure to uphold these rules, or even complaining about said rules, will result in the [http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_inc/2349182.html?thread=44895102#t44895102 lamest drama] the [[Internet]] has ever seen. So much so, that the more drama-inclined members of wtf_inc were driven to create a [http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_inc_discuss/ separate community] for the purposes of allowing the members to spew forth vapid [[wank]] without polluting the community proper. Surprisingly, wtf_inc's maintainers are highly active in the discussion community, despite the fact that wtf_inc_discuss' stated mission is to [[LOL]] at wtf_inc members.
