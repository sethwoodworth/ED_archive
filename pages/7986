TMZ
'''TMZ''', or ''National Enquirer 2.0'', is a gossip site and TV show for [[16-year-old girls]] created by [[NWO|old white men]].  [[Some argue]] the letters TMZ stand for thirty-mile zone, referring to the "studio zone" within a thirty-mile radius of [[shit nobody cares about|an intersection in Los Angeles]]. Shooting locations outside this zone are subject to mileage and travel time charges by the talent and crew, so the Jews at [[AOL]] keep the show tethered to save [[jewgolds|money]].  Others say it stands for The [[Milhouse]] Zone, referring to the intense levels of fail that surround it.  Oh, and they pay for stories.  [[That's some fine police work, Lou|That's some fine journalism, Lou]].

The 'brains' behind TMZ, he pretends to be an openly [[gay]] man, but is in reality a straight man reverse-[[beard]]ing to cover the [[epic]] amounts of douchebaggery and [[fail]] that is professional gossip.  In a bid to get famous, he nearly got [[OJ]] freed before the [[retard]]ed jury did.  He aired a video on the CBS west coast feed that alleged impropriety by prosecutor Marcia Clark, which was [[lie|patently untrue]].  [[Gg]].

==[[First Post]]==
As real journalism has disappeared into the sludge of advertising and politics that we call '[[old media|mainstream media]]', the First Post phenomenon has replaced [[cool story, bro|in-depth reporting]] that gets to the root of the story.  Instead, whoever tags their name to the story first gets [[nothing|something]], and TMZ is no different.  Celebrate their brilliant work with us here.

It's only a matter of time until the guy chasing you with the camera gets [[pwnt|smacked in the face]].  Or maybe they just need to [[basement dweller|get some more sunlight]].

==[[JFK|JFaKe]]==
In a moment of epic [[lulz]], TMZ fell victim to a [[troll|brilliant play]].  On December 29, 2009 the TMZ staff posted '''[http://www.tmz.com/2009/12/28/president-john-f-kennedy-photograph-jfk-photo-boat-yatch-nude-naked-women-mediterranean-sea-jackie-kennedy-ted-kennedy-senator-george-smathers-election/ The JFK Photo That Could Have Changed History]''', containing what appeared to be images of Kennedy just before the election, sunning with nude swimmers on a [[ITTY BITTY BABY ITTY BITTY BOAT|boat]].  Their [[expert]]s claimed that [[This Looks Shopped|this didn't look shooped]], but they were [[fail|wrong]].
