161
{{stub}}

[[OP]] is a fag. OP gets a totally [[1337]] tattoo [[gay|paying homage]] to his fave [[image board]] and posts it to /[[b]]/ hoping for [[unrealistic expectations|praise and the approval]] from his peers in the [[peanut gallery]]. OP then [[noko]]s his post and kicks back awaiting [[WIN|mad props]]. 

OP, however, is obviously a [[newfag]] who should have [[lurk moar|lurked moar]] because [[btards|/b/tards]] never evar have anything nice to say about '''anything''' (except perhaps [[Caturday|cats]]) and OP's [[fail]] tattoo was no exception. So OP gets relentlessly mocked for his tattoo which /b/tards decided said '''161''' and not '''/b/'''. OP then starts to cry and runs off to get his '''161''' tattoo [[lazor]]ed off.

Apart from that...why the fuck would you want to get a tattoo of a [[cancer]]ous image board on your body for life? Marking yourself with '''/[[b]]/''' is akin to marking yourself with [[jews|a series of numbers]] to show the world that you're a [[holocaust]] survivor. Getting the mark of the [[moot|/b/east]], is like announcing to the world that you live in your mom's [[basement]], have no life and [[fap]] to pix of [[m00t]] wearing a dress. Or those gay noodz of m00tle. It's like saying: <big>'''"Hai world! I'm a fantastic fucking faggot and spend all my time looking for [[CP]] on the [[4chan|asshole of the Internets]]!"'''</big>
