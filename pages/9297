You amuse me
'''You amuse me''' is [[internets]] slang for "I am [[pwned]] but I won't admit it."

Used by self-styled [[intellectual]]s as a [[condescension|condescending]] defense mechanism when they have been called out on their [[faggotry]]. Other favored forms include "You make me laugh," "Your arguments are risible in their inadequacy," and other forms that involve lots of words.

People who don't measure their [[e-penis]] size with a thesaurus are more likely to use "im [[lol]]lin [[IRL]]" or "u so funny bb."
