As the [[Republican]] governor of notoriously [[Democratic]] [[Massachusetts]], Mitt [[nom|Rom nom nomney]] has proven to the [[Satan|powers that be in the GOP]] that he's got enough bi-partisan appeal to win the [[United States]] presidency in 2008. The problem is that Romney is a [[Mormon]], and thus believes that when he dies, he and his [[waifu|wives]] will inherit a planet in outer space, where they will have celestial [[sex]] and bear many space [[children]]. Mitt Romney is for giving laptops to people and giving away free college. Why? For the [[lulz]]. In related news, Romney has been the subject of many flame wars on Republican blogs for [[Shit nobody cares about|flip-flops]] on [[abortion]].  He is loved by such Republican fags as [[Mann Coulter]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], and [[Michael Savage]], even though he introduced a universal healthcare bill in his state that was identical to Obama's.  But let's be honest, it was okay 'cause he ain't no nigger.  Did we mention that he's a motherfucking MORMON?!!!  No seriously, he's a goddamn MORMON!!!
==Olympics==
Mitt Romney is the guy who organized the 2002 Winter Olympics in Mormonland.  In other words, [[you]] were able to watch [[jailbait|13 year olds]] [[lolicon|prance around]] the ice because of him.  Mitt Romney is strongly opposed, however, to any forms of child exploitation, just like many of his [[Mark Foley|colleagues]].  Mitt said he learned a lot from the experience that inspired him to be a politician, such as "how to kick all the other countries' asses by exploiting the lives of America's youth and rub it in their faces later".

[[Bill O'Reilly]] has pitted Mr. Romney against insane former First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] in the black person for the White House.  He insists that he will be tough on terror, which makes sense, considering that he's a [[Mormon]] and all.  At this, [[liberalism|liberal]] [[blog]]gers rushed to put away their [[Ramen]] and get writing about how O'Reilly is SUCH A [[retard|RETARD]] [[OMG]].  Ignoring the fact that Mormons wouldn't lift a sword to save their [[your mom|mothers]], they instead jumped to the defense of [[Muslim]] <s>terro-</s> leaders like Iranian Whosiwhatsit, and told O'Reilly to [[GTFO]] of TV.  Since two years is only too short a time to build up internet political drama and bitterness, these posts sprouted up everywhere.  Many had creative, original thoughts on the matter.  A [[Google|complex algorithm]] was used to bring you the most popular sources:

==[[Wikipedia]] Fun==
[[Image:MootRomney.jpg|thumb|right|mitt]]
Editing [[Wikipedia:Mitt Romney|Mitt's Wikipedia article]] is easy.  First, just read through [[at least 100]] kilobytes of [[Wikipedia:Talk:Mitt Romney|talk page comments]] <small>(Can you spot [[badlydrawnjeff]]?)</small>, complete with massive bureaucracy and [[Wikipedia:Talk:Mitt_Romney#General_Rules_and_plan|ground rules]] by the self-appointed Emperor of the article, [[Wikipedia:User:Fagles|Fagles]].  The preferred method of discussion is the [[Vulture]] Method.  If you're too [[fat|lazy]] to read all the talk, just create a new heading and bring up the same old crap again.  Doing this on such uproar-inducing ideas as [[abortion]] and [[gay]] marriage is especially l337.



==Controversy==

A homeless Vietnam veteran has claimed that current presidential candidate Mitt Romney had oral sex with him in exchange for food, blankets and ‘hugs’ in the winter of 1994, the Canadian media reported today. Ron Whitecastle, now 63, says that Romney ‘would show-up in the alley all coked-up and offer bags of hamburgers to let him suck us off'. Experts say that closet homosexuals often resort to acts of intimacy with strangers of poor reputation in order to exercise their sexual urges without interference with their public life. "He would ask for reciprocation but I refused," says Whitecastle. "He also liked being slapped while he was doing his thing. He really got into it." The effects of this information on the upcoming US presidential primary elections is not yet known and neither the Romney nor the McCain campaigns have commented.
