Cluttertrap
'''Cluttertrap''', Clutter for short and also known as "Fei Androgyny", , is a recent trap, explored on [[trapchan]], [[/b/]], and [[desuchan]]. Known for her baby-face, dramatic emo kid make-up, and her wide acceptance for her delivery of [[Tits or GTFO|whats asked of her(penor to)]], aswell as her surprisingly large breasts. she claims to have been on hormones since December of 2010, a bit over a year now. Users of trapchan and /b/ call her the next [[Linetrap]], but her attention whore qualities draw as much backlash from posters as it does praise.

==Shemale Yum==
While the admin of Trapchan refuses to give Fei her own board, the admin has apparently referred her to the very same "Shemale Yum" that [[Linetrap]] started her employment on. It seems silly when she delivers so easily. I mean, look at all these... I'm not even posting half of them. Nudes apparently came from a cellphone hack after her cell number as grabbed.

==Cluttertrap's Story==
Fei left her home in Nevada County with a bang.  Through rumors it is obscure what exactly she did as people have different accounts.  Reportedly, Fei saw her mother by pure chance in New York.  Someone else fill this shit in.

==Cellphone Hack==
Some users apparently found BUCKETS of pervy, trap-outing nudes when hacking her cellphone after a high school classmate outed her cellphone information. Other users used the info find her exact location. It was posted on /b/ and many threatened to attack her at her home, leaving threatening messages. Nobody went through with it cause anon is pussys.
