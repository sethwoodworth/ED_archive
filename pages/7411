Shadowrun
'''''Shadowrun''''' is a game that combines the team-based shooting of ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' with the typical elves and magic bullshit that you find in ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. Purchasing this game gives you a replacement [[virgin|V-card]] in case you lost your old one. It is also notable because it is the first game that allows [[Xbox 360]] users to get their asses handed to them by someone using the superior controls available on a PC. 

==History==
Once upon a time, there was a shitty ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' clone called ''Shadowrun''. [[Cyberpunk|It was about a million years in the future where corporations ruled everything, you could get on the interweb with your brain]], and also there was magic, dragons, elves, dwarves, orks, and [[trolls]] for some reason. It actually wasn't half bad, and the creators made a fuckton of money until they sold it to some [[Hitler|German douchebags]]. They hated ''Shadowrun'' and all things win, and began plotting ways to ruin its reputation so that nobody would have fun ever again.

After they created the [[SNES]] game of ''Shadowrun'' which over overused the term "chum" as if you were a shark hunter.  Taking the idea of [[crap|crappiness]] of SNES, and combining that with the [[shit|shittiness]] of ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', a decision was made.

"WE NEED NEW ''SHADOWRUN'' CRAP, but on the [[Internetz]] like all the other [[RPG|RPGs]]."

==Gameplay==

The gameplay in ''Shadowrun'' is simple. You can choose to play as either a human, a [[Midget|dwarf]], a [[troll]], or an [[Douchebag|elf]]. All races start off with some basic spells and a handgun. You get other weapons the same way you do in ''Counter-Strike'', meaning you magically acquire money by killing people and wire it through nowhere to have weapons magically appear in your hands. No matter how good your weapons are, though, you're going to get nuked by someone with the spell that summons a gigantic fucking ice demon to kill you and your entire team.

==Fandom==
There are no ''Shadowrun'' fans. After trying this game for about a day, everyone who bought it went back to playing ''[[EverQuest]]''.
