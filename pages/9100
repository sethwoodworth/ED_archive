Winnebago Man
Jack Rebney, AKA Winnebago Man, was a Winnebago salesman in the 1980's, who hired a film crew to shoot a series of commercials for him. In the course of filming, Jack would frequently lose his shit and rage on camera. His rage sessions never made it to the final cuts of the commercials, but years later that same film crew would release the outtakes on [[YouTube]].
