'''iScribble''' is a site with a [[iPad|stupid name]] where a person can draw or [[Typing with one hand|chat with other users]], thus providing entertainment for [[at least 100|at least 100 percent]] of people on the internet who would rather waste time ruining a blank space with a terrible user interface than actually draw something that won't be deleted within hours of uploading it.

==The Boards==
[[Image:iscribblecrap.jpg|thumb|left|Typical selection of boards. Notice the board where they're "Dawing" Pokemon.]]
[[Image:Le_Mans_Legend.jpg|thumb|right|Nice car! Almost like a photo! Why on iScribble?]]
[[Image:Animm_iscribble_001.png|thumb|right|iScribble's [[Shit|rapidly deteriorating]] [[Furfags|community]] cause boards like this to appear.]]

iScribble has a forum-like format where users browse through a selection of boards like a plumber's snake through a clogged toilet.
The post-it note sized boards are too tiny for multiple people to work on. Since collaborations always look like shit due to the often massively varying levels of skill between users, some people choose to draw decent looking work with the shitty tools and infinitesimal size of the board, which is a waste of effort since a person could just as easily open [[Photoshop]], or even [[MSPaint|Paint]], and produce [[shit|results]] in infinitely less time.

All the boards can be classified very easily, since people who create public iScribble have no creativity whatsoever, and can only force their deflated tire of a brain to identify the topic of their thread as [[Katy|"Randomness!!XD"]] or similar shit.

When boards actually have a topic, it is usually overdone shit like anime, or video games and shows, or even worse, animals. These pictures of animals are lifeless and dull. The animals are never doing anything, they're just sitting there and looking like the 2-dimensional etching on a blank board that they are. Not only are most pictures of animals drawn on animal boards the most boring pictures of that animal you'll ever see in your life, but sometimes, furfags get on and start drawing their faggotry, which is also terrible.

==Drawing Games==
[[Image:Drawing_Space.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Explain how in fuck people can draw something satisfying in this space.]]

The most terrible kind of board are the dreaded "Drawing Game" boards. These boards take the already incredibly shitty size of the drawing space and chop it up into sections for people to draw in. A person is forced to draw in a space the size of a ticket stub, and it's fucking miserable.

Judges (who are just normal users who have imaginary power and are filled with fake authority because of this) decides the topic of what to draw in a drawing game. Drawing game boards are typically cut into 8 or more squares, each of these too small to hold a proper drawing. Even worse, one has to draw these drawings in a very short amount of time, so no effort can be put into it and it ends up looking like a piece of shit.Judges appointed among the users decide which of the drawings are best, and label them with a 1, 2, or whatever according to how they compare with the others. However, nobody fucking cares if they turn out to have the best drawing because there's no prize or anything, just proof that you can draw a horrid drawing in five minutes instead of an even more horrid one. It's only temporary, too, because you have pride for about 10 seconds before everybody has to erase everything and start over, leaving you with a wasted 5 minutes you could have spent [[Masturbation|DOING SOMETHING ELSE.]]

==RP Boards==
<strike>The first thing you'll notice in the huge [[clusterfuck]] of boards is the [[Orgy|"RP boards".]] These are [[Cancer|grossly enlarged tumors]] of [[Wolfaboo|wolfaboos]], [[Weeaboo|weeaboos,]] [[Girls|13-16 year old girls,]] [[Furries|furries,]] [[neckbeard|neckbeards,]] [[Over 9000|and beyond.]] Mods bitch and whine about [[Whining|"omg y r there so much daym rp boards all of u r retards",]] but [[irony]], they don't do shit about it. These boards are by far, the most easiest thing to troll. Trolling results into [[Winrar|great victory]] of [[butthurt]] while a [[God|mod]]  comes in to strike their mighty [[banhammer]], that is if you can withstand the sheer [[shit]] that these boards have to [[Buttsecks|offer.]]</strike>

LOL NOT ANYMORE. [[Faggotry|RP]] has officially been [[Banhammer|banned]] on the [[Gay|lovely]] iScribble. Now, all the [[emo|emo]] [[Warriors|Warrior]] kiddies and [[Wolfaboo|wolfaboos]] have officially been [[Baleet|banned]] from public rooms, leaving them to [[Masturbate|cry]] in private boards. Now all [[you|we]] need to do is get them banned from [[deviantart|devianTART]].

==The Users==
[[Image:SELFISH.jpg|thumb|right|160px|"Fuck you, you selfish fuck! That isn't fair!"]]

Most of the users on iScribble are like fucking Alcoholics Anonymous members, always supporting each other. That might sound nice and utopian, but if a person should say one mean or disrespectful thing, they go batshit insane, not believing you're talking to them. They hate anybody who messes up their board with an undying anger only a rabid bull could hope to match.
[[Fact|If you type all your words backwards, they'll think you're speaking in a different language.]] 

TLDR; Users of iScribble cannot detect sarcasm, seriousness, or lulz.

iScribble users are also [[you|incredibly self centered and stupid]]. They have the belief that the rules they make are to be followed, no matter what, if they put rules in the title or description. Naturally, most of these boards are public, and thus completely open. If they didn't want their shit to be [[rape|raped]], that's their fault. They had the option to make their board private.

==The Mods==

[[Sarcasm|iScribble has a wonderful selection of caring mods that care deeply about their job.]]

Well, not really. iScribble's "mods" are lazy derps that expect you to treat them like [[Srs bsns|the second coming of Jesus]]. [[Unrealistic expectations|Instead of reporting the person and leaving the board to back to what they where doing,]] they'll hop into the raging and whining and [[trying too hard|call you "children" or "kiddos"]] like they're [[assholes|your mom.]] Even if no one is doing anything ban-worthy, [[Baw|ur gonna get banned cuz ur 2 meen 2 dem.]] These people stick together like a [[Human centipede|human centipede.]] Nearly all mods are just chosen because they draw [[Bullshit|good]] or because a mod granted them the magical banhammer just because they are [[Buttbuddies|friends.]] Also, if you ever try to critque their [[Traced|amazing artwork,]] or tell them to stop doing something, [[Butthurt|your ass is gonna get BANNED.]]



<i>Some of these lovely workers:</i>

<b>[[Internet tough guy|Kerr]]</b>: A huge asshole that never calms the fuck down. Thinks he's God and can do [[Yiff|whatever he wants,]] when he wants. This is due to the fact he's friends with [[Otherkin|Culpeo-Fox]], a famous foxtard.

<b>[[Bitch|Sarahsays]]</b>: Think's shes [[Whore|sexy]]. Trolling her results to her to sic her little mod buddies onto you because [[Retard|she's too lazy to do her own job.]]

<b>[[Jerk|Broglex]]</b>: [[Not|Think's hes the coolest thing ever and everyone likes him.]]

<b>[[Boring|Stevo]]</b>: [[Loser|Just sits dead in a board 90% of the time.]] 10% of the time he'll talk about [[Shit nobody cares about|shit nobody (and even the mods) care about.]] Followed by an endless stream of "What a cunt" where ever he [[MAN THE HARPOONS|plants his fat ass.]] 

<b>[[Crybaby|Sketchpad]]</b>: Won't stop [[STFU|bitching and whining]] about everything. <b>PROTIP:</b> Make as many [[Sparkledogs|wolf]]/[[Furry|furry]]/[[Warriors|warriors]] RPs as fucking possible to [[Great success|piss him off.]]

==[[Lulz]]==

iScribble is not very well maintained by its moderators, so it is very easy to dash in and [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|ruin somebody's board]], then get out and go elsewhere to make more mischief. Since iScribble has an anti-fun system that allows users to vote to undo everything a user has done, this kind of attack is [[Pokemon|not very effective]], but it does annoy the fuck out of the board users, since they have to wait for the board to load again while it undos your operations. However, if the board has no regular members in it, the lulz last indefinitely until a regular should come along and initiate the undo vote, since non-regulars cannot initiate that vote. Also you can effectively ruin the board by voting an undo for the most skilled user in the board since mostly all the time all the users say yes to the vote resulting in even [[moar]] lulz.

===Trolling Methods===

*Enter random board, erase the best work on said board and immediately leave.
*Reference a couple of memes. If someone actually understands them and understands where they are coming from, proceed to spam every meme that comes to mind for [[lulz]]. 
*Bring in a mod. Once they enter, personally insult them and then wonder why you were kicked from the board.
*Jump between the line of [[pretty cool guy]] and [[troll]] constantly. 
*Stumble upon an [[internet tough guy]], act like an idiot until he leaves [[butthurt]]. 
*Draw shitty images that take up 60% of the board, bitch loudly when people attempt to set your ass straight.
*Have friendly conversation with an eliteartistfag, suddenly turn your back on them and start acting like a typical [[nigra]]. When drama ensues, take his side again and claim it was because you are "just a tool like that".
*Draw a crude penis into the background of the board. Be sure to include a pulsing vein, a lot of hair on the balls, and decently detailed helmet.
*Mention [[naruto]] in a video game board, and watch people believe it.
*"Accidently" start dotting randomly on the board with piss yellow, large points.
*Go to an RP board and [[rape|do everything]] but RP.
*Get everyone on the board to yell [[fail|FAILZZ!!!]] at you after meme spamming.
*Explain [[delicious cake]].
*Explain the [[detroit|crack head, nigger infested cesspool]] that stands between [[you]] and [[the cake is a lie|delicious cake]].
*Use shocking and vulgar language. Such as: [[Fuck]], [[Cunt]], black person, and [[Dick]].
*Draw offensive and shocking images. Such as: [[pedobear]] and [[baby fuck]].
*???
*[[PROFIT]]!!!
**[[Promotions]]

===The "Overwhelming Horde" Method===

With proper planning, it is possible to overrun the public boards of iScribble with hundreds of operatives to destroy the boards and cancel the undo vote with their superior numbers and equal vote. Users would scurry away into their private boards and cry, or beg for entry from the public-private boards. It would be chaotic, magnificent, and epicly lulzy, but will probably only get done [[at least 100|at least 100]] years from now because organizing a raid on the internet is like getting Goth teen fucks to sing in a choir.

=="Draw-it"==

[[Last Thursday]], Post-it ''([[Obvious|The brand responsible for marketing Post-it notes]])'' released a flash game [[Plagiarism|eerily similar to iScribble]], unoriginally dubbed [http://www.gamenet.com/game/post_it_game/ "Draw-it"]. The game plays out like Pictionary, minus the team aspect and using the interface's limited number of drawing tools. Drawing turns are limited to 60 seconds, with 1 player drawing at a time while the other players in the room attempt to guess what is being drawn. Of course, this is assuming that the game is being played [[srsly|seriously]], which 9 times out of 10, it is not.

You can expect to see the chatbox being flooded by endless streams of [[spam]], artist's renderings of [[Racist|the Klu Klux Klan in action]] and [[WTC]] in progress, or if you're lucky, the game being broken entirely ''(As demonstrated in the video below)''.
