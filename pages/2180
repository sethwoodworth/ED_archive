Dell
[[Image:Dell.jpg|thumb|Dude, you're getting 3 to 5.]]
Dell is where you can buy a piece of [[shit]] computer for next to nothing, and then spend about 2,000 dollars upgrading it to make it marginally useful. After that, you have the privilege of spending a week trying to get rid of all the [[Windows|spyware]], adware, and useless programs that come bundled with it. And to make matters worse, if you remove all that shitware, dude, you've invalidated your warranty!

==Tech support==
Dell offers free tech support to any moron willing to purchase their computers. Most of Dell's tech support staff are curry eating [[Indians]] who speak with a very annoying accent. 

==Dell & The International Jewish Conspiracy==

It is a known fact that Dell keeps its prices competitive by using the internal organs of the [[Chinese]] in its manufacturing process (see: Wal-Mart business model). According to some [[Nazi]]s, this has upset the [[Jews]], who are pissed that they did not think of this first. However, these turdheads aren't aware that Dell himself is a kike, and much of the reason his company makes such a profit is that he's using Jewish business contacts to negotiate cheap deals on kosher parts. The biggest clue given as to just how much of a Jew Michael Dell is was demonstrated on February 15th, 2001, when he unnecessarily fired over 7000 of his employees just so he could donate 40 Million bucks to a Jewish charity. Not one single person "laid off" was Jewish. Still, it proves [[Hitler]] was right all along.

Dell bought the shitty 1up.com [[for the lulz]]. He also fired most of those schlubs for the same reason.

==The "Dell Dude" Explained==

''Dude, you're getting a Dell'' was a famous ad campaign featuring laid-back "cool kid" Benjamin Curtis. It spawned a number of boring [[catchphrase]]s ("Dude, you're going to hell", etc) and is most definitely  an [[old meme]]. Alas, the pressures of celebrity overwhelmed Ben and he was was busted for buying [[weed]] in Union Square like a [[noob|fucking noob]]. He can currently be found [http://evilbeet.blogspot.com/2006/10/dude-youre-getting-quesadilla.html waiting tables] at a Tortilla stand. [[Srsly]].

==Rise of the Machines==
[[image:ExplodingDell.jpg|thumb|right|A Dell attaining Paradise]]
Not content to merely serve as [[porn]] respositories and [[World of Warcraft]] terminals, brave Dell laptops began a campaign of [http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550 suicide bombing] against their oppressive human masters. Other Dells have flocked to the [[terrorist]] banner, and have successfully committed [http://consumerist.com/consumer/dell/dell-laptop-burned-down-my-house-235167.php arson] and [http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/08/dell_fire.html vehicular sabotage]. As usual, the only defense against this aggression is <s>racial profiling</s> not buying one.

==Core Dell Features==
Features of a Dell rarely vary from one another. If you find a Dell that does not have the following features, recheck your brands.

Prime features of a Dell include:
*A 366-day working period.
*[[Shit|Cheap ass components]] that are guaranteed to [[Fail|fry]], overheat, and start massive wildfires.
*A low-end [[Intel]] processor that cannot overclock.
*Massive amounts of fail and [[anti-lulz]].
*[[Over 9000]] trial software applications, all of which will explode if you donâ€™t activate them in less than 10 seconds and will make your new quad-core CPU run slower than a 486.
*Free technical support outsourced in Saturn that make [[Bix Nood]] sound intelligent. (You too can [[Fail|attempt]] at 1-800-WWW-DELL if you wish.)
