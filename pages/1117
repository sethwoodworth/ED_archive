Bothan spy
[[Image:Bothan.jpg|thumb|right|Many Bothans died to bring you this bad cosplay]]Back in the [[Star Trek|Old Republic]], a group of [[Mexico|aliens]] would go around [[Internet stalking|spying]] on other people. Eventually, the [[Unidentified Rodian with jacket|people who kept getting spied on got annoyed enough and began capturing and executing them]]. 

Bothans debuted in ''Return of the Jedi'' as the habitually [[pwn]]ed spies responsible for feeding the Rebel Alliance [[factual inaccuracy|info]] about ''Death Star: The Next Generation.''  Bothans were not depicted visually until they were added as a playable species to the ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' massively multiplayer nerdfest.  As it turned out, they were [[furry]], hoofed, sorta [[camel]]-like mammals almost uglier than your average SW Galaxies player, so they were an immediate success, and a very disturbing fan following has arisen for a species that is mentioned exactly once in the films, and then by that redheaded [[lesbian]] bitch in the choir robe who's not Leia.

In the game ''[[Knights of the Old Republic]]'', the possession of a Bothan Stun Stick is described as "grounds for execution as a spy"&mdash;which is rather silly, as you can just pass the thing to some guy and have him executed. You might as well get some other crappy generic stun stick to muck around with. And for some reason, when you use it, you don't get busted for it. Maybe 'cos you have the Force. Yeah, that's why.

As a species evidently willing to die in large number to bring controversial or dangerous information to those most in need of it, Bothans are sort of the patron alien race of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].
