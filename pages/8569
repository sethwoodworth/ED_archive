The internets can be a difficult place to fit in. And before they were [[Al Gore|invented]], [[IRL|the real world]] was often a pretty difficult place to fit in, as well. Ever since the first cavemen invented [[faggotry]] and [[basement dweller|awkwardness]], [[you|socially inept people]] have desperately tried to [[buttsecks|fit in]] with [[your mom|their siblings]]. This has always resulted in [[failure]] because they are trying Too. Fucking. Hard.

==Why do people try so goddamn hard?==
[[Image:Meandsuzana.jpg|thumb|This is totally spontaneous]]

The various reasons for this usually revolve around wanting to be popular, be it to [[sex|pick up girls]], earn [[EPoints]] or simply make [[friends]] because you don't want to [[dying alone|die alone]], choking on [[ramen]] in front of your [[computer]].
Trying Too Hard is usually a result of the following process:
# Realizing you're a pathetic [[loser]]
# Realizing [[mediacrat|some people]], on the other hand, are [[rich and beautiful|not]]
# Identifying their actions/behaviors that you believe explain their popularity
# [[Fail|Attempting to repeat said actions/behavior in the hope of instantly becoming popular yourself]]
# [[????]]
# Deficit.

This might look like a foolproof method, but it consistently results in much [[butthurt]] and/or [[furcadia|making friends with other losers]].
People who Try Too Hard make Grade-A [[lolcow]]s, with the added benefit that they'll just keep on trying and providing enough [[lulz]] to power [[New York City]]. Because they're so fucking desperate.

==Examples of Trying Too Hard in [[IRL|Meatspace]]==

* Adding [[serial adder|gajillions]] of "friends" to your account on [[livejournal|social networking websites]]
* Using [[meme]]s and/or [[netspeak]] at all because you want to appear "in" while being [[LURK MOAR|too lazy to acquire your internet license]]
* Writing an [[attack article|awesomely scathing article]] about you ex-best friend / girlfriend / boyfriend / school and dropping their dox.
* Contributing to [[ED]] by creating links to "[[at least 100]]", "[[over 9000]]" or "[[an hero]]" on EVERY FUCKING PAGE
* Uploading pics of your ex'''/'''that kid you don't like from your school'''/'''some random whore from [[MySpace]] to [[ED]] and then adding them to [[Fat|degrading articles]] as an attempt at revenge
* Replacing every exclamation mark you ever type with "[[oneoneone|!!!1]]"
* stating in your blog that you've gone through 10 journals in the past two years and stating, "thinking is a hobby of mine, you should try it sometime" just so people will be deceived into believing that you actually are thoughtful
* [[Quitting IRC forever]]
* Trying to [[forced meme|jam your stupid ideas]] down [[Anonymous]]' throat
* Posting [[recoloring|shitty pics]] on DeviantART so that people will like you (SPOILER ALERT: you'll die alone anyway)
* Asking for comments on said [[copypasta|pictures]] every 2 seconds (SPOILER ALERT: Nobody cares)
* Saying "[[nice try|That's photoshopped]]!" every time you see a picture, so that people won't think you're gullible, even though not commenting at all would simply devoid the possibility of being gullible to begin with.
* Posting pics of your [[cutting|bleeding wrists]] instead of simply killing yourself.
* Attempting to [[troll]] people by getting involved in long-winded arguments that end up taking more of your time than theirs (SPOILER ALERT: you have [[oh noes|trolled yourself]], [[lol]])
* Ignoring someone's message on instant messengers or IRC for 2 hours before responding in an attempt to appear busy, or indifferent in the hope that people will forget you're an [[attention whore]] who never gets out of the house.
* "''Re-Liking''" a statement on Facebookâ„¢ directed at certain individuals, because not only do you ''not'' have a vocabulary of your own, but you can "cleverly" say, "Oh, I just liked the statement, I didn't actually ''say'' it!  OHHHH SO witty! 
* Turning every online argument into a [[Linux]] vs. [[Microsoft]] debate
* Saying "btw that was [[sarcasm]]" every time you're being sarcastic
* Using MySpace
* Adding "Zors" to the end of internet acronyms, like LOLZORS, or FAILZORS.
* Posting videos about your shitty, boring life on YouTube
* [[Writing yourself into an article|Adding your own name to Encyclopedia Dramatica]]

==If someone has linked you here==
You're a shallow and pathetic piece of shit, most people hate you and you should consider visiting warmer climates, such as hell. Any actual human beings who don't hate you are simply losers just like yourself, who are after your pity friendship in the exact same way you're after theirs. You probably have a face only a mother can love, and even she hates it. Enjoy your symbiotic fail.

==Do you repent?==

If you're one such loser and wish to change your ways, here are a few starters. Read very carefully.
# "No one cares about my pathetic existence." Repeat this to yourself every time you're about to interact with another person.
# "Hmmm, am I actually any good at this?" Ask yourself this question every time you're about to create content ([[music]], [[Oscar Wilde|writing]], [[furries|drawing]], [[whatever]]). If you answered "no," you are correct. If you answered "yes," ask for confirmation from [[4chan|random strangers]], because imaginary friends always say "yes."
# "Does it actually matter if this person doesn't like me?" Ask yourself this question every time you get laughed at for being such a goddamn [[retard]]. Consider whether it's worth trying to convince your tormentors that they are wrong, taking into account the fact that any such attempt will almost certainly result in getting laughed at even more.
# "Hasn't this joke been made like [[Over 9000|twenty billion]] times already?" Ask yourself this question every time you're about to make yet another of your clumsy attempts at humor, e.g. posting "[[old meme|I for one welcome a Beowulf cluster of our Soviet Russian overlords]]," or "[[unfunny|That's a good car analogy, but does it run Linux and Duke Nukem Forever?]]" on [[Slashdot]].
