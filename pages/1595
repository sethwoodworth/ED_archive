'''Circular logic''' is where one bullshit argument is proven by another bullshit argument until your original argument is proven by itself. [[Stupid]] people will actually fall for this and then [[a winnar is you]]; [[clever]] people however will see through your flawed points. This is when you should tell them to [[check your facts|check their facts]] and take that time to think of real case for your [[POV]]. Alternatively, just use the [[troll]] method by pretending (if necessary) that you were just trying to piss them off the whole time.

=="Proof" with the Absence of Evidence==
Contrary to what [[religion]] may tell you, the absence of [[evidence]] actually IS the evidence of absence. Or rather, why choose to believe in [[Christianity|something]] in which there exists no evidence? It may warm the hearts of [[cancer]] patients and [[shota|four year olds alike]], but being irrational is nothing to be [[pride|proud]] of. In such cases as described above, the weak, [[emo]]tional human attempts to fill in the blanks in his own mind. The conclusion inevitably stems from [[retarded|fallacious]] reasoning and easily dismissed [[Fact|credible evidence]]. 

There is a rule of thumb for resolving any assumptions that you may feel are lacking in evidence or may be logically circular: Ask yourself if your beliefs are religious in nature. Are you easily [[butthurt|agitated]] by questioning of those beliefs? Do you become en[[raged]] at the thought of others producing irrefutable evidence contradicting your deep seated beliefs? If you answered yes to any of the questions, you may be suffering from cognitive dissonance! [[Enjoy your X|Enjoy your AIDS]], [[faggot]].

== Examples ==
=== Hank ===
[[Image:Hank.jpg|thumb|Hank is always right, [[ironic]] because this image is [[pain series|completely wrong]].]]
* "Hank's always right because the list says so, the list is right because Hank dictated it, and we know that Hank dictated it because the list says so. That's circular logic, no different than saying 'Hank's right because he says he's right.'"[http://www.jhuger.com/kisshank]

=== [[W|Bush]]'s War ===

#Bush says we are at war.
#Bush does whatever he wants.
#Whatever Bush does is legal, because we are at war.
#The war doesn't end when Obama's in office because of Bush, who is wrong because he's Bush.

=== [[Christian|Christianity]] ===
[[Image:Circular logic.jpg|thumb|left|Occam's Razor cuts through god's bullshit!]]
* If it's in the Bible, then it must be true, because the Bible is the word of God, because it says it is, because the Bible is the word of god, et [[bullshit|cetera]].

=== [[Emo]] ===
* Somewhere in that circle I got inserted I don't know why but don't you know it's all my fault?[http://carmsie.livejournal.com/1118.html]

==Related Concepts==
* Correlation equals causation: When two phenomena consistently happen together or in sequence, they must be causally related. For instance, it has been [[Flying_Spaghetti_Monster|shown]] that the average global temperature has risen as the number of pirates has fallen; thus, global warming is caused by the decline in pirates.
