Brad Fitzpatrick, also known as {{lj|user=bradfitz}} and {{lj|user=brad}}, is a [[geek]] and the founder of [[LiveJournal]] (if you haven't heard of it, then congratulations on your new computer â€” we're surprised you found your way here).

In January 2005, Brad [[Livejournal Buyout|sold]] LiveJournal and its parent company, Danga, to [[Six Apart]]. This buyout allowed him to purchase more [[hookers and blow]] than ever possible in the past. His other hobbies include software developing and asking members of [[damnportlanders]] to buy him some booze. 

Brad's mom is Sandy, who is a total [[MILF]]&mdash;provided that, in this case, the [[unfunny|"F" stands for "forget"]]. 

On August 6, 2007, Brad left LiveJournal as a result of [[fan]]s spamming his e-mail over [[The Great Livejournal Strikethrough of 2007]]. However, he returned on December 3rd after being offered a new throne in the wake of some [[The Great LiveJournal Buyout of 2007|serious business]]
