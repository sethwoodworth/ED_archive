Pleasant muse
[[Image:Bf33.jpg|right|thumb|A distant relative of Peter Pettigrew from [[Harry Potter]]]] 
[[Image:Greedy_kad.jpg|right]]{{lj|user=pleasant_muse}} is a [[furry]] on [[LiveJournal]]. He refers to himself as a "male college kitty", and frequently ends his comments in "sigh!" His alternate journal, {{lj|user=pleasant_mews}}, chronicles his days as a "ten-year-old kitty-boy" who also moderates the {{lj|user=kitty_lovin}} community.

Despite having [[flounce|flounced]] from {{lj|user=neopian_adults}} on [http://pleasant-muse.livejournal.com/179181.html?nc=11 August 13, 2007] for being reminded [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4621620.html?thread=35236660#t35236660 not to break community rules], pleasant_muse continues to haunt the community on a daily basis. He has bitched [[over 9000]] times about not being the first to post some random useless [[shit]] in the neopian_adults community. Despite being [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4701188.html?thread=35948548#t35948548 stifled by a mod], he continues to be a drama whore every chance he gets.

Because of his furriness, pleasant_muse feels the need to post cutsey HTML-coded posts [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4686070.html every] [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4669968.html chance] [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4666915.html he] [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4663527.html gets] ([http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4658302.html and then some]). He also posts comments that make [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4680824.html?thread=35680632#t35680632 no sense whatsoever], and posts filled with [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4656659.html wannabe role-playing dramalicious emotions].

On August 24, 2007, {{lj|user=fuzio_}} flew off the handle, causing a major shitstorm for pleasant_muse, calling him fucking [[dumbass]], fucking [[moron]], and the child of a [[stupid]] [[cunt]]. {{lj|user=fuzio_}} then dared to ask the ultimate question "Who the hell, especially an alleged heterosexual male, introduces themselves like that?" After the [[drama]] ensued, pleasant_muse dragged the [[lulz]] to his [http://pleasant-muse.livejournal.com/183641.html?nc=14 personal journal], where he received advice and sympathetic [[yiff]] that completely went to waste.

After the drama, pleasant_muse posts in the Neopian_Adults guild on [[Neopets]] under hard_case.  Thinking that most of us wouldn't figure out it was him on his side account, he acts like a total [[fag]].

==More useless shit==
As if neopian_adults was not filled with enough posts about [[shit nobody cares about]], pleasant_muse feels the need to post more spam about [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4660627.html winning prizes worth nothing]. He also used the community as a place to [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4621020.html cry] when an imaginary creature stole 5,000 imaginary neopoints from his account. When adviced that he was being [http://community.livejournal.com/neopian_adults/4621020.html?thread=35234780#t35234780 pathetic], many words of wisdom came out, such as:
