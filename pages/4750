'''Last.FM''' (formerly Audio[[fellatio|scrobbler]]) is a program that allows [[user]]s to [[OM NOM NOM|eat]] all of their CPU and RAM power just to see what songs and [[pr0n|pr0n groove]] they've listened to. An [[open source]] plugin is installed to one's player of choice, and [[MP3]] metadata, along with your IP and any recently entered credit card numbers, are then transmitted to the Audioscrobbler servers where it is then cataloged among the user's recent tracks, and tabulated for determining top songs and artists both server-wide and for individual end users. They also enjoy tracking your [[Jenkem]]. No, believe me. They do.

'''UPDATE'''!!!:Last.FM is no longer a nonfag paradise thanks to money-hungry and shittier versions of Last.fm  MOG(moar like FAG, [[amirite]]?) and HypeMachine.

'''UPDATE'''!!!: [[Anti-lulz|HairMetalAddict]] is no longer a moderator! Now a subscriber!


'''UPDATE'''!!!: Last.fm used to be prime trolling territory with [[Anti-lulz|HairMetalAddict]] out of the picture, but as of now [http://www.last.fm/user/Thaelvyn Thaelvyn], has ascended and taken [[faggot|HMA]]'s throne, if you post a single negative thing about a band he routinely checks you get insta-banned or muted meaning you can't post in shoutboxes temporarily. [[PROTIP]]: Just fucking troll where [[french|Thaelvyn]] doesn't regularly check at.

==Drama==

Last.fm has been the source of [[internets]] [[drama]], as it is used primarily by all walks of holier-than-thou [[scene]]sters such as [[badlydrawnjeff]] to [[flaunt]] their devotion to (a) particular band(s) or genre(s), usually to prove one's self more [[hardcore]] than someone else.

A common pastime for the [[Homosexual|elitist prick]] on Last.fm is to go to the artist page of a popular band, and say that this band "sucks" and anyone who listens to "real music" will agree. Another common activity is to make an "Anti-(Insert name of popular band)" group, in which the members can have a circle jerk talking to each other about how much (popular band) sucks. To appear truly jaded and hardcore, do BOTH of these at the same time.

Other users have gone even one step further than this, creating "anti-entire genre" groups, and 9 times out of 10 they are completely [[idiot|ignorant]] of said genre and they're usually [[heavy metal|metalheads]]. In response to this, some concerned last.fm citizens have set up the [http://www.last.fm/group/ANTI-METAL ANTI-METAL] group (Despite most of them liking metal), solely to piss off elitist [[13-year old boy]] metalhead pricks. They seek out anti-genre groups and [http://www.last.fm/group/Fuck+rap+and+hip-hop/forum/55831/_/370559 troll the fuck out of them] and [http://www.last.fm/group/Fuck+rap+and+hip-hop their shoutboxes], creating much lulz. 

== Forums ==
{{quote|Rap is for thug, it's bring hatred and intolerance in young peoples mind's, we must stop this plague !!}}
The Audioscrobbler forums consist principally of groupies [[whore|promoting]] their friends' [[local band]]s, [[hipster]]s bickering about musical talent, or other mind numbing space wasting threads that only belong on either [[Formspring|trollspring]], [[Facebook|failbook]], [[Twitter|shitter]], [[MySpace|MySpastic]], or some self obsessed whiney neurotic fucks blog.

Examples:
*''Musical Compatibility with the user above you'' MMM ME SEE WHO I SHALL MAKE MY GIRLFRIEND NEXT.
*''Post Something About the Person Above You '' OH YOU DIDNT JUST SAY THAT, YOU SO FUCKING DID! LET ME LOOK AT YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY AND CALL <Insert Random Artist Here> GAY! THAT WILL TOTALLY GET YOU BACK! ROFLMAOWTFBBQHEAIJIOEJGIHISEOGH!!!!!!11!1!!111!
*''What Are You Listening To Right Now?'' BECAUSE LOOKING AT SOMEONES PROFILE IS SO FUCKING HARD!
*''Post your current weather where you live...'' I LOVE TO HEAR HOW THE WEATHER IS AROUND THE WORLD FROM STRANGERS I'VE NEVER MET AND ABOUT PLACES I WILL NEVER VISIT! PLEASE, TELL ME MOAR GOOD SIR.
*''What was the highlight of your day?'' MINE WAS SO FUCKING BORING SITTING AT A COMPUTER ARGUING ABOUT <Insert Random Artist Here> AND HOW MUCH MORE HXC THEY ARE THAN <Insert Random Artist Here>
As you can see, just browsing the topic titles already would make a sane person want to stick their hand into blender, if only to get them away from that IQ lowering festival of pointlessness. To prove just how bad (or good. i dont even fucking know anymore...) this place can get, here is a [[Fact|genuine excerpt]] from a typical topic:

''Scenester 1:  The drummer from [[emo|Remembering Wednesday]] is sooo dreamy!  *swoon*''<br>
''Scenester 2:  Those [[sell out]]s have the shittiest chord progression I've ever heard.  They suck.''<br>
''Scenester 3:  [[Omgwtfbbq]], you like [[hardcore|On The Edge Of Forever]], and they sound exactly alike.''<br>
''Scenester 1:  [[Poseur]]!''<br>

Deviation from creating a topic that doesnt require only half of a rotting hemisphere of brain mass will result in being branded a troll, because as we all know, FORUMS R [[SRS BSNS|SRS FKN BSNS]]. This includes topics where the user might actually have fun and enjoy themselves as opposed to just posting crap that doesnt even matter.

== Tags ==
Last.FM allows users to tag songs they listen to by genre, or by any other criteria they can think of. Other users can then listen the bands people have given specific tags using the player. Since tags can be easily added and are not moderated, any song will likely have a full spectrum of tags from [[folk]] to [[j-rap]]. The tag for [http://www.last.fm/tag/brutal%20death%20metal brutal death metal] has been hijacked in this way after a concerted effort.

[[Image:Abbagrunge.gif]]

However, due to [[retard]]ation or possibly [[hipster irony]], you will never EVER hear a band from the chosen genre.

==Last.fm History==

=== The Great Last.fm Flame Wars of March 08 ===
[[Image:gosmokeashotgun.jpg|thumb|this faggot > you becaus
e he's into REAL HARDCORE]] [[Shit nobody cares about|The flaming began]] when g0sm0k3ashotgun swore at cutslikedrugsx and called him a fag,  [[lie|claiming]] that cutslikedrugsx had [[bullshit|started shit with him]]. Cuts then responded with shear absurdity, admitting to being a furfag and typing random links and comments into Shotgun's shoutbox. Cuts then escalated the [[fursecution|conflict]] with [[irony|changing his user pic to Shotgun's]]. After a stern warning from the mods, Cuts changed his user pic to a much more emo one, impersonating a scenester with the intention of further provoking Shotgun's [[police|quest to purify the internet]] of all lesser emos. This [[epic fail|duel]] spilled over into [[at least 100|millions and gajillions]] of other users' shoutboxes and forums and artist pages [[lulz|annoying everyone]]. Soon bajilliagooglilians of other [[fucktard|users]] were in on the flaming. The intensity peaked when buttsocket, a [[Internet_Vigilante_Group|DEFENDER OF REASON]] attempted to arbitrate the hostilities. He wrote an [[tl;dr|objective and well written open letter]] calling for maturity and criticizing both Cuts and Shotgun for their failure to [[attention_whore|act like reasonable people]]. Cuts responded with a copypasta from a complaint letter generator and Shotgun replied by [[fursecution|claiming his actions were only in defense]]. Cuts is now [[an hero]]. [[teh|TEH]] END LOL.

===(Jan 2009 - May 2009) /B/ring Me The Horizon and the Stampede of Anti-Troll Moderation.===
It all started in the Bring Me The Horizon shoutbox and it all ended in a vicious acts of Modfags [[faggot|bmxgamer]] and [[faggot|HairMetalAddict]] giving out bans and being the [[anti-lulz]] as usual. '''TL;DR version.'''

It all started when some losers and amateur [[trolls]] thought it would be cool to start spreading [[racism|hate]] around in deathcore band shoutboxs because nothing is better than making [[scene|scenefags]] [[butthurt]] about their shitty music taste. Nobody knows how it came to be, maybe it was fate. On the Bring Me the Horizon shoutbox, Oli Sykes's hair was dissed, and on the Job for a Cowboy shoutbox random bree jokes ensued. On the Bring Me the Horizon shoutbox it eventually got so bad that every single post was some stupid shit, and [[lulz]] that it made every Bring Me The Horizon fan [[butthurt]] and some of them even eventually [[Suicide|became an hero]]. Nothing had happened like this on this site before.

[[shit nobody cares about|The trolls consisted of a]] [[Attention Whore|13 year old female asian vegan atheist]], [[faggot|a Romanian loli fanatic]] , [[user:Raz0rs|a nerdy college kid with no life]], [[faggot|a dude in his mothers basement posing as a scene chick]], a [[Weeaboo|wapanese anime guy that was banned]] , an actual asian, [[faggot|and some 16 year old dude known by his cookie monster avatar]]. The [[faggot|cookie monster guy]] thought it would be cool to create a group. He called it [[shit|"The Fellowship of the Trolls."]] This group was made for fucking around, targeting specific members to [[troll|spam the shit out of them]], and also performing massive amounts of orgy on each other. In the few weeks it was around, it amassed 1.3k shouts and 700 posts, probably becoming the most active per time group by threefold. [[lying|This group was responsible for creating like 50 different]] last.fm [[memes]], all involving oli sykes or deathcore in some way.

Well, some fags and [[scene|scenefags]] got [[butthurt]] too much that they eventually learned that they can actually report in last.fm, and thus led an odd turn of events that the group disappeared around May 20th with no notice or reason. After a few attempts to create the group and continued disappearance we were notified that it was being deleted and any more attempts to recreate the group would result in a ban. 

To this day, the mods have made it a policy of deleting shouts of anyone who says anything offensive about anything or says something bad about any band. [[butthurt|They shut us down completely]]. The Bring Me the Horizon shoutbox went from 13k to 7k shouts after the mods mass deleted all of our posts. Modfags still continue to patrol the shitty shoutbox now in an attempt to actually think they can do something.

However, it soon became apparent that mods didn't have the energy required for lulzkilling on such a massive scale, and trolls reign supreme on shoutboxes such as this: http://www.last.fm/music/Dream+Theater
