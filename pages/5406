Aspergium is most commonly found deep underground. It was introduced in Minecraft Alpha, version 1.0.1_01, and requires autism or aspergers to be used.
When aspergium ore is destroyed, it drops 4-5 asburgers. These can be placed on the ground to look pretty, or be crafted with a stick to make a delicious lollypop (Also known as Sony Move Controller (also known as a dildo)). These items are very useful in the production of more autistic traps or mechanisms. Currently, the aspergium ore can be found deep underground, often 1-7 blocks above the Adminium located at the bottom of maps in-game. Aspergium ore does not emit light until it is hit by something or stepped on.

== In-game Uses ==
The introduction of Aspergium was a large step for autistics, and brought with it the mechanics of useless red dust crap, making it pretty possible to create autisticircuits linked with switches, buttons, levers, pressure plates and logic gates, which can currently be tied to things like doors, minecart tracks, TNT, and quatro's awesome t-shirt design.
It is possible to connect levers, buttons and pressure plates directly to doors, as aspergium is not always needed.

For example, landmines can be made by placing pressure plates directly onto the top of TNT blocks, or even on a single block on top of the TNT.

Lollypops (Playstation Move Controllers) act as some kind of gate thing and can be made by crafting a burger with a stick.

Wires made from Aspergium Burgers will not carry their charge further than 15 blocks. However, it is possible to extend their range to a degree by making some extender gate thing.

Some of the possible uses of this new substance include:

*Traps (land-mines and similar)
*Door (because they're very hard to open yourself)
*Minecartin (junctions)
*Complicated logic systems
*Miscellaneous stuff

'''Aspergium Burgers''' can be placed on the ground to make a grease stain or crafted with a stick to make a Playstation Move Controller. These items aren't very useful in general.
Grease stains used to be destroyed when stepped on in-game, but this was changed due to an uproar of autistic rage.

Asburgers change shape depending if there is someone hungry next to it.
