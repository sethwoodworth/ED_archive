Once in a great while something [[Epic|great]] happens. Be it your friend saving your [[Ass|ass]] from the [[communists|pedophiles]] while you were playing [[Battletoads]], or you went [[Vandal|behind enemy lines]] to create [[lulz]] with nothing but your blood, sweat, and [[win|bare hands]]; only to find yourself cornered, out-numbered, and about to be [[Pwnd|perma-banned]] by some [[SysOp|admin]], but suddenly saved by the poor excuses you call "friends", then you have experienced what is known as '''/b/lackup'''.


==Origin Of [[Win|/b/lackup]]==
Back in the day, [[at least 100 years ago|at least 100 years ago]], some oddly intelligent [[/b/tards]] at [[4chan]], shook off their [[Goatse|shock]] induced cancer and hatched a plan. Though these brave and brilliant [[oldfags|souls]] were forgotten, their acts are now [[an legend|legend]]. Thus, the great [[Habbo Hotel|HABBO]] WARS had begun. 

But, that has [[Habbo Hotel|its own page]]. 

What really matters, is that for once in their shitty lives, they threw aside their pitchforks and loli, and joined together for the greater [[lulz|good]]. Making their targets [[emo|sniveling little]] [[16 year old girl|bitches]].

The term "blackup" most likely originates from the nigger slave term of "Rebellion", or perhaps "To Reinforce". In other words, 
"[[Ebonics|Yo dawg cum help a brudda steel summa dat bikes shit]]".

When the nigras were fed up with the continuous punishment and lack of white vagina from their American Masters, they called for /b/lackup.

When the blackup arrived months later on the ships from Africa, much rejoicing was had throughout the nigger community, as the /b/lackup proved more the enough to kill their oppressors, and rape the white wimminz.

/b/lackup, on the other hand, originated from the fabled [[Habbo Hotel]] wars, whereas whenever [[Basement Dweller|flea ridden]] [[Fag|faggy]] [[SysOp]]s [[B&]] 5 /b/tards, 50 more would show up just to show they can.

==Stories of [[buttsecks|/b/rotherhood]]==

Now, [[/b/lackup]] can be applied to anything having to do with your [[nigra|/b/rothers]] bailing your ass out, when [[you]]'re too fucking useless to do it yourself, or calling in reinforcements to finish the job. However, In case you want to be the /b/lackup, here's a few tips on how to [[WIN|save the day]].

'''Step 1:''' Sit on 4chan.

'''Step 2:''' Get bored looking at loli.

'''Step 3:''' Wait for a raid to start.

'''Step 4:''' Wait until someone comes screaming to /b/ for /b/lackup.

'''Step 5:''' Don your /b/lackup apparel, which consists of being a nigger, having an afro, and a nice clean business suit.

'''Step 6:''' Spam "Pool's closed due to AIDS"

'''Step 7:''' [[????]]

'''Step 8:''' [[WIN]]!

After this, repeat as needed until your [[dick|afro]] needs grooming. 
This is the cycle of /b/lackup. 

If you're the one getting bailed out, be ready to experience mild to severe ass-rape if lulz were not had.

/b/lackup was used extensively in all the Habbo Campaigns.
