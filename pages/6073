Org Infinity
[[Image:Mary_Sue_Whore_House.jpg|center|frame|Well, at least it's accurate. That's a nice change of pace.]]
Another retarded club on [[DeviantART]] dedicated to the steady flood of [[mary sue]]s running around in [[KKK|Organization XIII]] coats with anagrammed names, '''Organization Infinity''' isn’t just thirteen [[retard|idiots]], nor is it simply an orgy of [[fat whore|fat whores]]. Organization Infinity is an orgy of [[fat whore|fat whores]] with about 275 [[aspie|members]] signed up, spreading the plague all over DeviantART. No one is safe from the [[Mary Sue|OC]] spam, and you can even find occasional talented artists in there as well.

==About [[Lemonparty|Org Infinity]]== 
It is to be made a fact that [[Lemonparty|Org Infinity]] will turn your brain into shit, and corrupt any good artist. One example is [[Imagec0rrupt3d]], who now runs around with long pink hair, raping other female [[Mary Sue]]s and fighting crime with a ferocious, pink [[wtf|hairdryer]]. Just like every other [[lemonparty|Org Infinity]] member, [[Imagec0rrupt3d]] insists her character isn’t a [[copypasta|rip-off]] because it has [[boob]]s, and longer hair. [[shit nobody cares about|We can all probably agree that this isn’t the first example of genderbending of the original characters, and naturally all of the offenders claim it's an OC, when it really is a poorly designed Mary Sue]].

==The Club==
Now, [[idiot|whose idea]] was it to concentrate this mass of [[fangirl]]s sick creations into one club? Whoever it is needs a good [[banhammer|beating]]. Obviously the handywork of [[16 year old girl]]s, as the world would be doomed should [[The Internet is serious business|mature]] people begin futher parodying an Organization full of [[fag]]s. And of course, in an organization that big, we need '''two''' superiors. These two, [[heterosexual|Xelcan]] and [[babypaste|Shirix]], might be some of the more [[original character]]s of [[Lemonparty|Org Infinity]], and are the crown of their massive [[fail]].

Unlike the original in-game [[gay|Organization]], these [[fangirl]]s have [http://org-infinity.deviantart.com/journal/15091362/ divided their members into several grades]. If you are a [[shitty|good]] [[tartlet|artist]] you might get the grade of [[cockmongler|General]], and if you are a popular artist you might become [[lolcow|Assassin]], etc. This is of course, so they can divide those who are actually whoring for [[heterosexual|Xelcan]] and [[babypaste|Shirix]] from those unknown artists they really don’t want to associate themselves with. Every single one of the [[slut|members]], also called ''[[dick|Private]]s'', can be found on [http://org-infinity.deviantart.com/journal/13800886/ this list]] of [[faggot]]s. Do us all a favor and [[Troll|help]] them realize their [[fail]].

==Art==
[[Image:GTFO_Org_Infinity.jpg|right|thumb|Subtility is their middle name. Don’t think [[Lemonparty|Org Infinity]] will make you famous.]]
Not only would browsing the club's [[craigslist|gallery]] take [[at least 100 years|fucking forever]], it would also render you blind. Every female [[Mary Sue|OC]] is bisexual, with the few exceptions of a small number of [[anonymous|unknown]] artists. The truth is that any [[Attention whore|popular artist]] simply loves to see their OC(s) eat [[pussy]].

In Org Infinity you will find a policy much like [[bullshit|“A good artist gets away with anything”]], which is very familiar all over DeviantART. And who knows? [[unrealistic expectations|If you are good enough]] [[unwarranted self-importance|you might even get a mission]]!

===The Missions===
As a member of Org Infinity there’s a tiny chance you will get a mission from one of the superiors, where you will be forced to whore out Org Infinity on [[DA]]. A cunning ploy indeed, since it brings even more [[shit]]ty OCs. Naturally this is something they only provide for their more [[lolcow|popular members]]. As said previously, [[time paradox|the club has about 275 members, but in their gallery there are less than 10 deviations in the mission’s section]]. Considering the missions that has been given out, one could wonder if the founders of [[Lemonparty|Org Infinity]] ever played the [[Kingdom Hearts|game]]. The only thing that actually seems associated with the [[faggotry|Organization XIII]] is the bad habit of anagramming names and the [[BDSM|taste for leather uniforms]].

==Specifications of a Nobody==
There is one rule when you enter [[Lemonparty|Org Infinity]], that you must have an element, weapon, and home world, and the element '''MUST BE UNIQUE'''(unless it's not, like say, [[science|magnetism and electromagnetics]], or [[wat|code and cryptography]], for example). This of course, makes most of the "elements" quite [[lulz]]y.

===The Elements===
It’s the final proof that [[16 year old girl|teenager]]s have no idea what an element is when they sign their [[Mary Sue|original]] characters up with powers like:
*"shard"
*"wolves"
*"storytelling"
*"alcohol" (okay, MAYBE we could give them this one, if they were fucking [[doing it wrong|doing it right]].) 

===The Weapons===
This section is fucking hilarious, and it explains why we have no [[An hero|superheroes]] these days. Again, referring to the members list we see things like "flyswatter", "tattoo", "[[japan|chopsticks]]", and our personal favorite, "[[Mana Maiden|My Little Ponies]]". Yes, there are people who actually believe they could '''fight''' with objects like these, simply by labeling them as weapons and make them [[Imagec0rrupt3d|shoot angry specters]].

===The Worlds===
This is the section that should [[Butthurt|anger]] the common [[Kingdom Hearts]] [[fangirl]]. Not only have they "dispatched" members in about [[at least 100|eighteen worlds]] that don’t appear in the game, but a few of these worlds aren’t even [[Disney]]. By this it is highly unlikely that they have even '''played''' the game.

==The Superiors==
[[Image:Pedo_fagloves_his_shota.jpg|left|thumb|[[heterosexual|Xelcan]] is a pedofag who loves little [[loli]], though otherwise he’d be glad for a good [[pegging]].]]
It really is [[fail|tragic]] that the two leaders of [[Lemonparty|Org Infinity]] are so degenerated as they are. Then again, who fits better to lead the army of [[Mary Sue]]s than two fake [[bisexual]] [[attention whore]]s?

===Xelcan===
Now, the less horrid of the two is most likely [[heterosexual|Xelcan]], who is probably one of the only males in the whole club. Considering most of the [[Mary Sue|OC]]s are either dykes or bi women with [[XBox|huge]] [[ass]] [[tits|boobs]] we can tolerate the faggot to some extent. 

Sadly, our hopes are crushed with his weapon. Not one, but ''two'' fans, neatly disguised under the name [[personal army|war-fans]]. His main goal in the orgy is to become a [[woman|geisha]] that [[rape]]s little [[loli|girls]]. 

According to the [[TL;DR|list]] of [[fail|members]] he resides in the Disney world of Pocahontas, and his element is [[wat|temperature]].

It really makes you want to puke, until you see the other superior.

===Shirix===
[[Image:Whore_with_fuzzy_ass.jpg|right|thumb|[[babypaste|Shirix]] is not only a cheap rip-off, but has a [[furry|fuzzy]] ass as well.]]
[[Babypaste|Shirix]] is perhaps the worst Mary Sue we have yet to see in the org, and her only equal would be [[Imagec0rrupt3d|another Mary Sue she is whoring on]]. Shirix looks like a [[offended|fusion between Marluxia and Sephiroth that went horribly wrong]], followed up by the common genderbending, and of course, having [[desu|two different eyecolours]], commonplace to any [[Mary Sue]] with no respect for herself.

Shirix can often be seen humping on Sexla, the Mary Sue created by our ever so loved [[Imagec0rrupt3d]]. Shirix’s element is white magic, and she wields a wand, in Halloween Town. Her originality is simply [[Fail|dazzling]]. 

Even though she wields a wand, she is often depicted with a [[banhammer]]. No, wand and banhammer is not the same. It’s actually a means of [[internet law|internet justice]], which really doesn’t exist in such a place as [[lemonparty|Org Infinity]].

For great justice, troll the fuck out of them, at full force.

==The Horror==

==Goodbye Org-Infinity==
After the Trolling began to kick in, [[shit|Windnstorm]] and [[babypaste|Nayruasukei]] quit being the leaders of the club and have not returned yet. They say they have "dropped-out" but we all know it's due to the [[bawww]]wing that went on.  Rumor has it and recent posts from either party say that the founders have abandoned the [[shit|shithole]] and moved to a new club known as [[emo|Rogues of Axiom]] where they can be free of the fuckheads that took over the club.  Both founders have revamped their [[mary sue|OCs]] and have become even more insulting to the already [[gay]] [[Kingdom Hearts]].

The club as of now is being run by any given [[retard]] that happens to get their hands on the password, leading to the further downward spiral and eventual crash.

But [[OI's closing its goddamn legs for once|godfuckingknows when applications might actually start]]. [[butthurt as always|DAtardlets]] are practically bending over in a firing squad line waiting to get the long-awaited ass slap [[YEAHRIGHT|that the group's up and running again]]. They're [[masterbating|gathering dust]] just waiting, all the while farting out about a million possible [[kawaii|bisexual characters]] ready to go. On a [[well that's a first|positive]] note for all who are too stupid to figure out that [[probably just gave one of them an idea|shitting unicorns]] isn't an element can go to a minichat to get their hopes and dreams shot down [[desu u_u|one at a time]] (or all at once if endurance isn't just a problem for them with their [[slut|mothers]]).
