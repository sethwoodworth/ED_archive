WIZZY
[[Image:Wizzy.jpg|thumb|Typical picture of Wizzy]]
A marvelously witless fellow, {{lj|user=Wizzy}} can be found in the wonderful world of [[LJ]] FAILING AT ENGLISH.

Having been around on LJ since THE YEAR OF OUR FAGGOT BC, Wizzy is no stranger to [[drama]]. He once got into a very long thread after [http://www.livejournal.com/users/wizzy/224336.html kissing a long-tongued snake-girl.] It seems that some took offense at his extramarital affairs and decided to push the all powerful [[BALETE]] button, sending this whining wannabe wordsrapist into a world of woe.

Lately, he takes out his frustrations in a [[community]] that he created by mixing up a potion of [[liberal]]s and [[neo-cons]].  He calls it {{ljcomm|user=right_left08}}.  His strange liberal views will have you waltzing in a world of wordraped weirdness.

If you want Wizzy to become whacked out, just use the letter "[[W]]" a LOT.
