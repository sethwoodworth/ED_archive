Tangent

In any flame war, argument or discussion online, it is important to have an entirely irrelevant '''tangent'''. This enables the thread to be completely derailed, allowing for unexpected [[drama]] and [[lulz]]. Tangential discussions are very popular with [[troll]]s who find it amusing to destroy any possibility of a conversation making any progress towards reaching a satisfying conclusion.

It has been hypothesized that the creation of tangential discussions of continuously decreasing relevance can indefinitely circumnavigate [[Godwin's Law]]. It seems doubtful that this hypothesis can ever be tested as no troll is likely to have sufficient expressive ability to avoid the effect of [[Internet Law#Protagoras's Law|Protagoras's Law]] throughout a thread of infinite length. Nonetheless, you are welcome to refer to this concept as '''Banbot's Hypothesis'''.
