A form of [[unwarranted self-importance]] where the claimer professes to have seen the birth (or [[death]]) of something people adored or loathed. Also, a method of brown nosing, as the claimer can later say that they helped the brown nose-ee get to where they are now. Using the term "I was there" will result of one of two things, the latter being the more recuring: one, you will look awesome, cuz u wur ther lol. Or two: you will look fucktarded because somone who really was there will be all like "You fucking retard, why would you lie about somthing so fucking gay like Otakon 2006?", causing much [[butthurt]]. Use with extreme care.

==Usage==
Eric: "Remember Homofest 2005?"<br>
Phil: "Yeah!"<br>
Paul: "Dude, I was there."<br>
Phil: "[[Srsly]]? Wasn't it fantastic?"<br>
Eric: "You guys are [[fags]]."<br>
[[China]]: "[[pwned]]!11!"
