Drama Queen Kim
[[Image:Evilclown.5.jpg|right]]
'''Drama Queen Kim''' is known by many names on the internets, including [[PB]], Psychobabble, [http://kimo48.livejournal.com/ Kimo48], Justme111, purplecrayon, mommyk, MistressofTaboo, birdsongforyou, kim_herself and Crusty. She's the selfless and devoted mother of 300 foster children, who masquerades as a veteran [[drama queen]] and [[Deleting your LiveJournal|deleter of journals]], complete with endless bad health, being a [[domestic violence|battered wife-whilst-pregnant-with-critically-ill-fetus]], puppy set on fire, kid snatched at gunpoint, cancer, [[suicide]] attempts, and attacks by [[hacker]]s. 

==Guinea Pig Drama==

DQK first came to the attention of [[LJDrama]] when she claimed to have rescued 300 cavies (limey for "guinea pigs"), and was outed as a liar. She claimed she was [[hacker|hacked]] by someone staying at her house, then attempted [[suicide]] and managed to track people's IPs while she was in hospital.

==Meele Drama==

Less than a year after her appearance on [[LJDrama]], Kim is a regular reader of the site and reads about crazy [[Meele]] the [[Phantom of the Opera]] [[internet stalking|stalker]]. She devotes herself to exposing [[Meele]]'s crimes, and attracts a band of fellow [[drama whore]]s on a blog called Psychobabble. When [[Meele]] uncovers Kim's seedy guinea pig past, Kim denies it's her, and deletes the blog claiming it wasn't her, it was Blogger losing it. She makes threats of [[legal action]] when [[Meele]] wonders whether she hits her children. 

After her community migrates to [[GreatestJournal]], people in her band start to question her claims. When she is [[harassment|harassed]] on [[LiveJournal]] by someone using the name birdsongforyou, people find early comments from that LJ with Kim's IP on them. The band disbands in disgust.

==Blogspot==

A blog belonging to one of Kim's former LJ friends, [http://fairlynaive.blogspot.com Fairly Naive], is taken over and becomes a blog about Kim's craziness, naming her Crusty. 

Then the blogger gets bored and hands the Fairly Naive blog over to someone else. Someone else doesn't take it in the direction they want, so they start another new blog, [http://notnaive.blogspot.com Not Naive], about Crusty aka Kim. But Kim's been quiet so they turn their attention to other people from the [[Meele]] drama, and make a post attacking [[cdaae]] for having [[depression]]. [[cdaae]]'s minions protest, Not Naive withdraws her comments and swears off being a drama monster. But not for long! [[cdaae]] is an [[Friends list|LJ friend]] of [[User:Gerbilsage|gerbilsage]] the notorious [[troll]]. Not Naive posts attacking [[User:Gerbilsage|gerbilsage]] and [[cdaae]] for being [[troll]]s and laughing at people with [[Wtf user info|stupid LJ userinfos]]. 

People begin to notice that Not Naive's writing style is exactly the same as Kim's. Since Kim has used a [[sockpuppet]] to [[harassment|harass]] herself before, they figure she preferred drama about herself to no drama at all. Fairly Naive posts about it, and Not Naive and Kim deny being the same person.

Along comes [[User:Daniels pengies|daniels_pengies]], sworn enemy of [[the LiveJournal Circle Jerk]] and [[User:Gerbilsage|gerbilsage]]. Not Naive welcomes [[User:Daniels pengies|daniels_pengies]] as a fellow enemy of [[the LiveJournal Circle Jerk]] trolls, because she is against the abuse of blogs and journals. She doesn't mind that he thinks he is the greatest troll of all, who posts [[goatse|pornographic picspam]] and [[sick fuck|sexual perversity]] to [[harassment|harass]] people. 

Kim is now posting her revisions of the past on [[User:Daniels pengies|daniels_pengies]]'s [[MySpace]], and Fairly Naive is keeping the world up to date on Crusty's misdeeds.
