Home state of fictional [[faggot]] [[nerd|Napoleon Dynamite]], and real faggot [[Larry Craig]], Idaho claims it is famous for its fine [[potato]] fields and other rural niceties. In fact, Idaho is a barren wasteland full of [[Mormon]]s, F.F.A. members, [[Nazis]], and [[pedophiles]]. Most Idaho residents have never even seen a real Idaho potato as they're all shipped out of state. Like Napoleon Dynamite, Idahoans boast of another "claim to fame" that most normal people would be deeply ashamed of, that being the origin of its name. 

== History and a bit of background ==
As the [[Indians]] that roamed the land never found it interesting enough to name themselves, some [[batshit]] crazy [[white]] [[asshole]] (mistaking the area for something worthwhile that he could [[profit]] off of) simply made up the name "Idaho" and convinced the old, conservative white men that it actually meant something in the native tongue. Although he of course [[fail]]ed miserably in ever making a dime off the worthless land, the [[retards]] who later settled there couldn't think of anything better and decided to keep the fabricated name.

== Current Daily Life ==
Idaho is perhaps more famous for its shitty web pages. All web pages from Idaho or hosted in Idaho look like the refuse of [[geocities]], since the state is roughly seven years behind the rest of the world in technology and social progress.

Idaho's urban metropolis, Boise, is actually [[pretty cool guy|a kewl place]]!! It is  home to some swinging night clubs, mostly because the rest of the state is so goddamn boring that the local entertainment consists solely of [[STD]] Bingo. You can also go up to any random Mexicans on the street and have them sell ya' some weed! Boise also isn't so redneck. To make up for its long history of redneck faggotry, Idaho recently made a [[black]] person Miss Idaho. They have since gone back to [[Purelily|Aryan chicks]].

Sadly, this article stands a chance of winning an award for "increasing awareness about Idaho.", as the [[TOW|Wikipedia]] page is damn nearly as boring as the state itself.

==Claims tuh Fame (Other than that all that horseshit Idaho is actually famous for)==

*Though she ascended her slippery ice throne in Alaska, conservative malfunctioning mouthpiece '''[[Sarah Palin]]''' was apparently spawned in [[White people|Sandpoint, Idaho]]. Thanks, Idaho! At least you gave us something funny to break up the racial tensions of Election '08.
*Back in [[Last Thursday|19whocares]], character-actor/Jew [[Ben Stein]] was appointed marshal of [[Rednecks|Sandpoint's winter carnival.]] He was so touched by this gesture (from a town eager to associate themselves with any minor celebrity who hadn't said "Nigger" a hundred times in front of millions of television viewers) he wrote one of those [[Trying too hard|embarrassing boost pieces]] for Reader's Digest titled ''They Don't Hate'' Me ''in Sandpoint''. This lapse on Idaho's part is easily explained since Stein released ''[[Ben Stein|eXpelled!]]'' and revealed himself as the worst Jew since Hitler. (Jewish institutions have yet to [[Banhammer|do anything about Ben Stein]], presumably because [[Castlevania|Simon Wiesenthal]] is fucking dead.)
