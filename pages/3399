Goldeneye 007
[[Image:GoldenEye007box.jpg|thumb|''Goldeneye 007'' was revolutionary as it contained Rumble Support, 4 players, and hot chicks, features that many gamers had never even experienced or seen.]] [[Image:Brosnanmouth.jpg|thumb|His mouth stretches past the gun.]]
The greatest first person shooter, and greatest licensed game ever made according to <strike>[[Fags|Nintendo Fanboys]] and [[Retards|people who have never played a shooter on a PC,]] anyone who wasn't raised in a trailer park.</strike> everyone except [[Your Mom|Jack Thompson]], '''Goldeneye''' was able to sell [[over 9000]] copies. In 1997, anyone who had a [[Nintendo|Nintendo 64]] had ''Goldeneye'', as there were no other games to play besides Mario, Zelda, and various piles of shit. Oh, and it was based off the 1995 [[James Bond]] movie ''GoldenEye''.

==Single Player==
Truth is, no one gave a flying fuck about the story in ''Goldeneye'', which sort of follows the plot of the movie that came out two years before the game did. Remember that in the 90s, Americans [[Shit nobody cares about|cared]] as much for [[James Bond]] as the [[French]] cared for bathing, because of the epic fail of the Timothy Dalton films (which [[Some argue|purists believe]] hews closer to the source material than the [[lulz]] of the [[Faggot|Roger Moore]] films). Simply put, a bunch of bad [[Communists|Commies]] are using the Goldeneye satellite to detonate an EMP on London for [[lulz]] and revenge. Bond saves the world by going through a linear, non-branching path, killing every idiot AI who tries to stop him. Oh, and aside from killing everyone, you also have to do shit like take pictures, get keys, turn generators on and off, and protect the slow, bullet-magnet of a [[Bitch|Bond Girl]] named [[Russia|Natalya]], who is a good Commie. And we all know the only good commie is a dead commie, [[amirite]]?

==Multiplayer==
The most popular feature of ''Goldeneye'' was the multiplayer deathmatch. ''Goldeneye'' was a great [[Jack Thompson|murder simulator]] for its time, as it featured one-hit kills, a decent variety of levels, a shitload of hidden playable characters, and different gameplay settings.

But how did four people play against each other in a first person shooter before the time of Xbox Live? Enter Split Screen, which had the amazing ability to make your pathetic 20 inch TV even more gay by splitting it in half or into four separate screens... hence the term, split screen, [[Retard|r-tard]]. It made camping impossible as your opponent could look to your screen and know exactly where you were. It made trash talk awkward as the guy calling you a pussy was a couple feet away from you and well within [[Pwnt|beatdown]] distance. And lastly, it completely killed the ability to be anonymous and talk shit over a headset to your [[13-year-old boy|fellow players]].

Originally, you could only select from about eight different character models, which were the main characters of the game. This led to people rushing to be the first to select James Bond as their character, because no one wanted to be stuck as any of the Commies. Then you could unlock four secret characters, which were villains from the Bond films: [[Tay Zonday|Baron Samedi]], [[Feminazi|Mayday]], [[Cockmongler|Jaws]], and [[Fellatio|Oddjob]], who fulfilled stereotyping conditions and was a [[Azn|midget]]. On top of these hidden characters were a couple dozen others you could unlock all at once with a button code. These super sekrit characters were really just the enemy body models with shitty face-mappings of the developers, as we all know video game developers suffer from severe cases of [[unwarranted self-importance]].

As previously stated, there were multiple gameplay settings. One was "Slappers Only", which, like the film's co-star, [[Fag|Alan Cumming]], is gay as fuck. It was basically playing Friday Night Sissy Fights in a first-person view. [[Some argue]] the best mode was The Man With The Golden Gun, which puts out one spawn point of the Golden [[Cock|Gun]], which is a one-hit kill weapon, not unlike [[AIDS]].

==Memes==
===DK Mode===
'''DK Mode''' is the first and easiest cheat in the game. It increases the size of the player's head tenfold and elongates the player's arms. This makes the player look like an [[ape]]. In fact, DK probably stands for [[Donkey Kong]]. This mode is achievable by completing the third level (Runway) in under 5 minutes. DK Mode also makes an appearance in [[Perfect Dark]]. This cheat has inspired some photoshop artists on /b/ as well, once they noticed that enlargening the heads of porn models made them look anime and neotenic.

===Get Down/Geddan===
'''Get Down/Geddan''' originated as a glitch in the game. Whenever the game cartridge isn't properly inserted into the console, characters and objects within the game have the tendency to spaz out and spin around frantically. This meme is popular amongst the [[Japanese]], who parody the glitch in YouTube videos with Japanese remix music.

In the Summer in the City [[Youtube]] gathering of 2010, on Saturday, August 7th, Youtube user littleradge made history with the world's biggest Geddan. This caused massive explosion of [[epic win]] in [[London]]. Major [[lulz]] were to be had that day.

==Sequels==
Sadly the [[Japs]] at Nintendo lost the license of Bond to EA, resulting in the James Bond video games to follow the last two Brosnan and both Dalton movies in terms of shitshowiness. The first of these was the PlayStation version of ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', which somehow had worse graphics than ''Goldeneye''. There have been spiritual successors to ''Goldeneye 007'', and one really horrible [[sell out|sellout]].

*[[Perfect Dark]]: There are [[Some argue|some who will tell you]] that ''Perfect Dark'' is even better than ''Goldeneye''. Well ''Perfect Dark'' had a better story with a [[Whore|female]] secret agent and warring aliens, better graphics, better multi-player, [[over 9000]] weapons, voice actors instead of just text, and [[crap|decent]] cutscenes. It had slowdowns but there's no way that you can play an FPS without [[lag]]. Everyone was getting hyped over the [[fail|Dreamcast]] and PS2 anyway, so most didn't care about it. It only sold a measly [[IT'S OVER 9000|2.5 million copies]] compared to Bond's 8 million.

*''[[Timesplitters|TimeSplitters]]'': Developed by the people who made ''Goldeneye'', ''Timesplitters'' is actually pretty fucking good and had tons of humor and [[ribaldry|sexual innuendo]]. It was truly overshadowed by ''[[Halo]]''.

*''Goldeneye Source'': [[crap|Decent]] multiplayer mod of [[Counter Strike]] plagued by [[hax|haxxors]] killing the user base. It is notable for the fact that the director of the mod became [[An Hero]] on May 24, 2006 by inhaling carbon monoxide from a charcoal grill, which set the rest of his apartment building on fire. This proved that being a flaming fag really could lead to real fires being started. Average match contains 2 players instead of the [[over 9000]] players the room was designed to hold, due to the [[Epic Fail|obscurity of the game itself]].

*''GoldenEye: Rogue Agent'': A game that has done more damage to ''Goldeneye 007'' than [[Rule 34]] ever would (note: the original creator of this article said "we need Bond porn, maybe [[Castration|Bond getting blown by Jaws]]"). Basically, EA took some [[Fag|retarded geek's]] fanfic and made a game out of it. GoldenEye is not a satellite in this game, but a fucking cybernetic eyeball made out of gold and shoved in a rogue 00 agent's eyesocket (hence the title). Couple that with uninspired mediocre gameplay (ripped right off from a [[Halo|particularly shitty source]]) and all of the classic Bond villains still being alive and warring against each other (told you it was based off a retarded geek's fanfic), and you got yourself a cheap [[Profit|cash-in attempt]].
