The Proper Words song is a video about a [[pedophile|disturbing man]] singing about children's [[penis|private]] [[vagina|parts]], on a playground slide. 

While most of today's generation have not seen the video, people who were growing up in the 80's were forced to watch it in class, or by their parents. The original video appeared in Safe Kids, Strong Kids (1984) and made children every realize that the Fonz was to be feared.

Also, some creepy doctor guy shows up in the middle to talk about young girls vaginas.

|He's explaining the proper names for genitalia and other intimate parts. It's aimed at children who normally use words like "pee-pee", "tinkler", or other infantile names. Cock and cunt used to be the proper words until the mid-19th century, when Victorian morality considered them too coarse for polite speech. Then penis, vulva, vagina, and anus, all Latin, were deemed acceptable. The﻿ earlier names, of Anglo-Saxon origin, were considered lower-class, then vulgar.|
|ewwww this guy﻿ is like a sexual predador >.<|}}</center>
