'''Budd Dwyer''' was a [[Pennsylvania]] politician best known for being the greatest man to ever live.   

==What Happened==

[[Image:Dead_Dwyer.jpg|thumb|Budd Dwyer is pictured here wasting useful B+ plasmas.]]

[[Image:Bitches_BuddDwyer.jpg|thumb|Actually, [[Bitches don't know|bitches]] probably know about this one.]]

[[Last Thursday|Back then]], Dwyer was the [[serious business|Treasurer of Pennsylvania]] when he was convicted of receiving kickbacks and [[Mitchell Henderson|losing the state's official iPod]]. Budd was [[GET OUT|asked to leave]], and faced [[at least 100]] years in jail and multiple kicks to the testicles, but did he puss out and let [[the man]] tell him what to do? HELL NO! Instead, he did quite possibly the most awesome thing the world has ever seen.

[[An hero|Our Hero]] arranged a press conference with as many people and news cameras as possible, and did so on [[Caturday|a day when school was closed]], so that every child could see him. That day, he made a [[TL;DR]] speech to the press, handed some papers out to people, and then pulled a .357 Magnum out of an envelope and '''SHOT HIMSELF ON LIVE TELEVISION!!! FUCKING WIN!!![[oneoneone|1]]!'''

Some of the last words muttered from the excessively nosebleeding man were [[Ripper|"I told you I was hardcore."]] Everyone [[drama|freaked the fuck out]] and turned off their [[cocks|cameras]]. However, [[sick fuck| one brave cameraman]] kept filming with a raging [[erection|hardon]]. A doctor was called to the scene, but it was too late. Our hero had already [[gg|died]] of [[china|lead poisoning]].

==On the [[Internets]]==
[[PSP|Betamax]] videotape copies of the incident spread across '80s [[America]] faster than the growing [[AIDS]] epidemic. These tapes were favorites among [[goths]] and other assholes, such as those douchebags who think that [[LOL|laughing out loud]] at death scenes in a movie theater is hardcore. These tapes evolved into that lame ''Faces of Death'' video series, which is basically crappy/fake footage of [[IRL]] deaths cut to really [[Black metal|shitty music]]. Eventually, some retard found the Dwyer tape and showed it to then-famous Jew Jay Stile of the [[Stile Project]]. After watching the video as an aphrodisiac and 3 hours of hot [[buttsecks|fudgepacking]], Jay had an idea. If he put the video on his site as a crappy 10X10 pixel, 56k mpeg (back in 2001 this was [[epic]] broadband for [[internets]]), he could make massive [[profit]]. After spreading the footage to a new generation of [[basement dwelling]] losers, he netted $20,000,000 in [[Internet money]]. Later, after blowing all of his [[Jew gold]]s on tranny [[hookers and blow|hookers and cocaine]], he sold the rights of the suicide to [[Jews|Mattel]] so they could make Budd Dwyer action figures (complete with press conference playset and "mystery" envelope!).  

==Pop Culture References==
* Filter wrote a song about Dwyer called ''Hey Man, Nice Shot''. Filter was one of the first of many crappy bands to pay tribute to Dwyer's great accomplishment. Most slacker Gen-X faggots think that the song is about their own [[an hero]] [[Kurt Cobain]], but this is only because they are stupid.

* Another [[shit band]], Marilyn Manson, used the clip of Mr. Dwyer saying "No! This will hurt someone!" in one of their lame songs.

* Liberal blubbertub [[fat|Michael Moore]] saw the video on Stile Project while searching the site for Japanese scat porn. He loved it so much that he included it into his movie [[swap.avi|''Bowling For Columbine'']].

* Radio fags [[Opie and Anthony]] constantly talk about him on [[shit nobody cares about|their radio show]].

*Former [[IRL troll]] Steve Albini's band, Rapeman, recorded an EP dedicated to him titled ''Budd''.

==Often Imitated, Never Duplicated==
Often known as the "Budd Dwyer" effect, many people have tried their own attempts at [[epic]] [[IRL]] suicide. However, with the advent of [[emo]] music, [[MySpace]], and [[LiveJournal]], 100[[Statistics|%]] of these would-be failures were assured to be [[Sui-Chan|complete failures]]. Many have tried, but Budd was the first, and <s>probably will be the</s> last, person to accomplish life's equivalence of a [[Mortal Kombat|flawless victory]].

==[[A challenger appears|Argentinian Budd Dwyer]]==
A former [[police]] chief in Argentina, wanted for committing extremely lulzy acts of torture during the 1970s, [[an hero|finished]] [[the game]] during a live interview with a local news organization.
