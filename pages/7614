'''Sniff Heinkel''' "Sniffles", or "Sniffy The Drama Dog", a [[Steven Slater|self-proclaimed homosexual]], is living proof you should never [[white knight|white-knight]] for furries, particularly if you are a [[furry]] yourself. Sniff Heinkel (aka [[powerword|Timothy Slosky]]) is an [[Georgia, USA|inbred]] [[furfag]] who is [[Domestic violence|clearly psychotic]]. He has recently been shitting his pants over fellow furfag scum [[Allan]] and has issues with [[Internet stalking|letting things go]]. He is currently permabanned from [[FurAffinity]] (and many other websites) for being such an utter failure at life. 

==Pawsru.org Incident (Sniff makes his appearance)==
[[Image:Sniff_giving_us_the_finger.jpg|thumb|The pic that launched a [[over 9000|thousand]] lulz.]]
[[Image:How_epic_was_it?.jpg|thumb]]

On January 12 2010, Sniff posted a thread featuring a [[Pics or it didn't happen|picture]] of his former roommate after he allegedly "brutally beat him", on the discussion board of pawsru.org (then paws.ru), a furry fetish porn site. The original topic of the thread was unclear, but its intended purpose was obvious: to establish Sniff as a [[force to be reckoned with]]. [[Anonymous]], [[troll#What is "Trolling"?|noticing what an opportune moment this was]], then set the bait by implying that Sniff was actually a skinny [[nerd]] and rebutting his claim that the picture he posted was actually of his roommate and not just a random pic he had found on the [[web]]. Sniff quickly took the bait and posted a picture of himself giving the finger in an attempt to win the argument by proving that he was not a skinny weakling. From the picture, it was obvious that Sniff was in fact [[morbidly obese]]. Basically after this, hilarity and a torrent of replies ensued. People eventually started posting pics of him when they found [[moar|more]] on his various online profiles. This of course only fed Sniff's [[raeg]] - which in turn resulted in more lulz - triggering the creation of a [[recursive feedback loop of lulz]]. 

After losing all hope of salvaging his [[E-penis|lolreputation]], Sniff [[BAWWW|baww'd]] to moderation to delete HIS OWN THREAD (yes, he really is [[Retarded|that stupid]]). One of the mods could only take so much of Sniff's bullshit, and his thread was finally bawwleted. But by this point it was too late, and troll threads started popping up to replace the original. While all of this was happening, Sniff's ex-roommate showed up after someone notified him on [[Facebook]] about Sniff's [[goatse|shenanigans]]. Sniff immediately shat all over himself and threatened to [[cyber police|CALL THE FUCKING POLICE]] on his ex-roommate, who at the time was living on the opposite side of the United States. The [[drama]] unfolded, and viewers discovered that Sniff had actually gotten a restraining order against his ex-roommate. When nothing else funny happened, everyone pretty much lost interest. Sniff was eventually [[banned|permabanned]] from pawsru.org for unrelated [[faggotry]] <s>and was never heard from again</s> and then [[Sniff Heinkel#How it was reborn again|this]] happened.

==How it was reborn again==
[[Image:Advicedogban.jpg|thumb|"I'm not mad at all!"]]

[[Last Thursday|On August 11th 2010]], Sniff created an account on the "Watch Your Step" forums owned and operated by SilverAutomatic and his cohorts of [[Lulz|drama-seeking]] furfags.
It began innocently enough - notorious [[furry art]] scammer [[Allan]] was called out on his shit by several other users, many of whom Sniff [[White Knight|white-knighted]] for. [[Allan]] agreed to return the money which most of the furries, [[pussy|pussies]] that they are, were willing to accept. Horrified he was not being [[Asspat|praised]] enough, Sniff did not drop it.

During the incident he would [[Crybaby|insult]] anyone whose opinions differed from his own regarding [[Allan]] and WYS assisting Allan with his [[bullshit|"addiction"]]. Eventually after failing to convince [[wrong|everyone he was right]] and giving the other forum members [[lulz|something to laugh at]], [[Psychopath|he lost it]] and began [[swearing|cursing]] in his posts and [[LOL WUT|demanded that he be banned]]. "Seriously, you guys need to get a life," said Sniff to all 14 of his split personalities. It's rumored that 10 of them laughed at him, and the remaining 4 just tried to kill him.

SilverAutomatic complied with his request, upgrading the 3-day ban to a [[Permaban|Permaban]] when Sniff sent Silver two messages [[BAWW|asking]] why he'd been banned, despite the fact that he [[idiot|literally asked for it]]. He then began [[harassment|harassing and spamming]] various [[sick fuck|members of FurAffinity]] also on WYS' forums, [[Coward|blocking them beforehand so they could not respond]].

==The Drama Unfolds ...==
[[File:Sniff Heinkel Suicide Journal.png|thumb|I ALMOST cut my wrists, you insensitive fuck!]]
'''<big>The Lawlsuit</big>'''

After telling everyone on [[FurAffinity|FurAffinity]] that he didn't [[lol_wut|care about the ban]] in a journal entry, he created [[Internet stalking|several ban evasion accounts]] to [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|read what the forum was saying about him]]. Finding a photo of himself and his [[Second Life]] Avatar, which were available publicly on the Internet, he proceeded to edit the journal post to [[U MAD|threaten SilverAutomatic with a lawsuit]] if he didn't remove the picture IMMEDIATELY.

Said picture is now at the top of this article.

'''<big>BRB Suicide</big>'''

When the weight of being [[Pwnt|made fun of by kid furfags]] [[Butthurt|got to be too much]], Sniff decided to do what any normal person would do: pretend to be [[Suicide|suicidal]]. Since ya know, [[Pogoroo|that solves everything.]] When even Dragoneer came to his Journal to tell him not to be so [[Fail|melodramatic]], Sniff once again [[E-Tantrum|lost it]] and demanded to be banned. Like SilverAutomatic, Dragoneer instantly complied with the demand.

'''<big>Epic Ragequit Fail</big>'''

Just when you thought Sniffles couldn't be anymore of a [[Lulzcow|loser]], he [[LOL|surprises]] us all and pulls even MORE [[Shit|magic]] from his his failtastic little hat. Clear out of the blue, he posts up a [[Unwarranted_Self_Importance|journal]] on InkBunny, telling [[Nobody_Cares|everyone]] that he was leaving the [[Furfag|furry]] fandom forever. Everyone laughed, because they knew that Sniffles can't stay away from [[Faggotry|all things furry]] for very long. And right they were, because every single [[Opinion|comment]] that's been posted on said journal has miraculously [[Delete_Fucking_Everything|disappeared]], proving once again that Sniff doesn't know how to [[An_hero|GTFO]].

'''<big>Sniff Joins [[ED]]: [[Exhibit B]]'''</big>

Utterly outraged by having his miserable life made fun of and thinking he has what it takes to become an [[epic]] [[troll]], Sniffles the [[Butthurt|butthurt]] created an article for someone who he THINKS created his article here and "ruined his life". And this is all he could come up with.

The article has already been purged. Thanks to the valiant efforts of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], Sniff has avoided 10 years in [[Bubba|prison]].

'''<big>Sniff Joins XTube</big>'''
