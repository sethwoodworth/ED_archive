Allecto
[[Image:allecto.jpg|thumb|300px|As with all fat lesbians she has a strange obsession with fairies and elvish shit.]]

{{lj|user=_allecto_}} (a.k.a. Dani) is both a batshit insane [[feminazi]] and an [[Australian]], living in the Blue Mountains in the state of NSW.  She is a self described "[[lesbian]] [[Star Wars|separatist]]" whose journal posts mostly consist of of [[crap|Youtube videos]] or long screeds about how [[TL;DR|all pop culture is an endorsement of the patriarchy.]].  She also makes no sense, and has way too much time on her hands.

==Overview of the stupid==
===[[Free speech]] for all! Except you patriarchal assholes.===
Her [http://users.livejournal.com/_allecto_/profile user profile] encourages free speech...except when it doesn't.  To wit:

{{tinyquote|First of all, this journal is for women who have a genuine interest in women's rights and commitment to [[Daddy's money lesbian|sisterhood]]. Discussion has always been a vital part of the development of the women's movement. If you disagree with something published here, please don't hesitate to say so unless your opinions fall under the [[banned]] comments section. If you do want to engage me in a discussion about something I have posted on my journal, please treat me with respect. You have every right to disagree, you have every right to tell me how and why, but you do not have the right to insult your own intelligence by attempting to insult mine. I am not easily offended and I will merely have a good laugh at your inanity before deleting your comment. So, don't be stupid if you actually want your comment to be published.

Banned Comments

All comments that are:

pro-[[porn]]<br>
pro-[[prostitution]]<br>
[[Asking for it|woman-blaming]]<br>
[[Hal Turner|racist]]<br>
[[misogynist]]<br>
[[Gay|lesbophobic]]<br>
pro-[[Libertarian|capitalist]]<br>
...or otherwise woman-[[Hate|hating]]<br>

will not be tolerated on this journal and will be automatically deleted.

I love to have good discussions with other women who do not always agree with me. But I will not allow comments that are insulting, woman-hating or potentially silencing of women.|You have the ight to free speech so long as you don't say anything I dislike.}}

Notice she says "[[lol wut|lesbophobic]]" and not [[homophobic]] - so feel free bitch about [[gay]] men as much as you wish.

===Fear of rape===
For someone who claims to be so [[Internet tough guy|badass and strong]] and to want a journal that "let[s] it all hang out, like all <s>lesbians</s> women Allecto has a deep and morbid fear of rape. For her [[gunt|"letting it all hang out"]] seems being bitchy, catty, dykey, frustrated, crazy, nutty, frigid, ridiculous, bitter, embarrassing, man-hating, libelous, pure, unfair, envious, intuitive, low-down, stupid, petty, liberating. ''We are the women that men have warned us about.''", she has a very strong fear of [[Almost raped|being raped]] while neglecting the fact that [[Common knowledge|women are capable of raping her too]].  Though she did advocate [http://users.livejournal.com/_allecto_/39173.html lesbianism as a viable birth control method].  That counts for something, right?

==[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]==
Making even more sense, allecto decided to [[bawww]] over some [[Lol wut?|gay firefighter group 
sex]] and how it makes football players rape cheerleaders and get away with it. Ironically 
enough she thinks that the two men that called rape three years after orgying are 
lying-"after the so-called ‘abuse’ all three men chose to stay within their career as 
firefighters"- while the cheerleaders were definitely raped. Allecto further promoted her sexual fantasies by saying  "We need to accept and support men who need a good group fuck 
before fighting fires, crime, war etc."
 
But wait!

After the bawing ended she posted this 
{{quote|*DISCLAIMER: [[lie|I do not believe a single word of what I wrote above...]]"|[http://allecto.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/firefighters-group-sex-scandal-exposed | _allecto_ ]}}
Just like any batshit crazy feminist she then went on another rant in the same paragraph about how men are all rapists, in an effort to confuse the fuck out of her readers about what just happened.
[http://allecto.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/firefighters-group-sex-scandal-exposed For more lulz, read about firefighter orgies and cheerleader rape here.]


==The [[Firefly]] Incident==
This [[luser]]'s main claim to [[E-famous|fame]], such as it is, is a [http://users.livejournal.com/_allecto_/34718.html 2,764 word screed on how Firefly is a sexist piece of rape-endorsing trash].  As of early April 2008, this post had received 146 comments.  Now, you're allowed to not like Firefly; after all, most of its viewers are [[basement dwellers]] just like [[you]].  But claiming a show with three women as main characters, two of whom are very skilled with either [[guns|weapons]] or [[hacker|machines]], and the third is the Jew somehow indicates "how much men hate us" is a bit hard to believe.  
{{quote|For myself, I’m not sure that I will recover from the shock of watching the malicious way in which Joss stripped his female characters of their integrity, the pleasure he seemed to take from showing potentially powerful women bashed, the way he gleefully demonized female power and selfhood and smashed women into little bits, male fists in women’s faces, male voices drowning out our words.|_allecto_}}

To this end, she read the scripts of every episode, and counted the number of times that male and female characters spoke.  She came up with 458 for men vs. 175 for women, which, well...it's a show about a male character, primarily, and what the hell does the ratio have to do with anything?  Oh, and because of the way the show is written, it means that Joss Whedon "Beyond a shadow of a doubt...uses his own wife in this way. Expects her to clean up his emotional messes. Expects her to be there, eternally supportive, eternally subservient and grateful to him in all his manly glory. I hope the money is worth it, Mrs. Whedon. But somehow I doubt that it is. No amount of money can buy back wasted emotional resources."

Oh, and having a black woman on the show makes him a racist.  Really.

Then there're the comments, which just get dumber from there.

In short, a classic example of [[Unwarranted self importance]].

==Where Are They Now?==
As of [[Last Thursday|January 2008]], _allecto_ has migrated to WordPress. Her new blog can be found [http://allecto.wordpress.com/ here]. She may also have started dating [[BitingBeaver]], because they both agree that a [[You|teenage boy looking at porn]] means that he's going to become a rapist and that he should be [[pwned|aborted]] [[IRL permaban|retroactively]].
