:"Classified" Scientology cult recording of founder L. Ron Hubbard from Oct 3, 1968, "Assists" course VIII.

The recording, in Hubbard's own distinctive voice, expounds Scientology's dissembling alien creation myth, whereby the earth is created by the evil "Galactic overload" "Xenu" (or "Xemu") and people are parasitized by alien spirits called "body thetans". Scientology reportedly exposes the alien basis to its beliefs to only 10% of its followers.

Contrary to Scientology statements about the compatibility between Scientology and Christianity, Hubbard maintains that, "There was no Christ" and that the stories of Christ are alien mind implants.

The documents focus mainly on two aspects: the first one freeing CoS from any responsibility of basically whatever that person runs into in life, the second being a formal acknowledgment of the person signing such a contract, to the standards and doctrine of CoS. Each document starts of with a formal agreement that "Scientology is a religion. the Church is a church of the Scientology religion.".

:The ZIP file contains two images, presenting scans of a CoS-internal document. The document serves as a sales-guideline for the OEC Vol. 0. The document relates to the "Material Sales Manual" and provides additional tactics for a CoS representative to successfully sell the OEC Vol. 0, even to people that already possess an older revision of the document. Starting off with a tale on taming a lion, the pattern advertised in this pamphlet is highly manipulative, promising the eventual buyer "guaranteed success in any activity!"

:The Introspection Rundown is a controversial Scientology procedure that is intended to handle a psychotic break or complete mental breakdown. The first step of the IR is to "isolate the person wholly with all attendants completely muzzled (no speech)." Auditing (psychological interrogation) sessions are given frequently, otherwise the person is not spoken to.

IR has been implicated in a number of cases, including the wrongful death of Lisa McPherson and the January 2008 kidnapping of Martine Boublil.

Lisa McPherson (February 10, 1959 â December 5, 1995) was a member of Scientology from 18 until her death at 35 under the care of Scientology's Flag Service Organization shortly after isolation on the Introspection Rundown.

''Summary:'''</big> 
::208 scanned pages relating to the Church of Scientology's former "Office of Special Affairs" employee and subsequent apostate Frank Oliver. The documents are dated between 1986 and 1992 (inclusive), when, according to the file, Frank Oliver was declared a "suppressive person" and ex-communicated. Fank Oliver should be able to verify the material and has appeared in the media before on subjects relating to the church. Starting on page 107, the document shows that at the time of writing the Church of Scientology was actively engaged in black propaganda (especially concerning psychiatry), "fair game" and infiltration.

::This document is a return made pursuant to English companies law by the Church of Scientology Religious Education College Inc.  It is important because it shows that (1) the Church of Scientology in the UK claims to not be liable for corporation tax (2) the Church of Scientology in the UK is exempt from requirements to file audited accounts. It also shows the income of the group.

'''Also from Dave Touretzky'''

* '''[http://www.xs4all.nl/~jeta/scn/scans/ReligiousServices.pdf Religious Services Enrollment Application]
:Six pages of boilerplate that says "whatever happens to you, it's entirely your own fault, not Scientology's fault, so don't even think about suing us."

* '''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Scientology/ReleaseForms/Introspection.html Spiritual Assistance: the Introspection Rundown]
: This document contains what some call "The Lisa McPherson Clause": the signer agrees to involuntary imprisonment, and isolation from friends, family, and medical care, at the discretion of their Scientology case supervisor.

* '''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Scientology/ReleaseForms/Enrollment.html Scientology Religious Services Enrollment Application ]

* '''Confidentiality of the Advanced Technology'''
: Scientology really doesn't want anyone talking about Xenu the space alien or what goes on in NOTs auditing after they leave the cult. So they're making people sign this confidentiality agreement to gag them for all time. Notice that there is a $100,000 penalty for disclosing this "proprietary" information!

* Orientation Film Contract
: Scientology now apparently requires a signed release form even to view the promotional film Orientation. What are they afraid of? Answer: the next Lisa McPherson. The most significant factor I can find on this form is the agreement that all churches of Scientology are independent of each other and individually responsible for their actions. This is what will allow Scientology to gut a local church of resources if it gets sued (as they did with the Church of Scientology of California after Wollersheim sued them), and preclude the plaintiff from filing suit against any other tentacles of the Scientology octopus. Of course, at the time they sign a release to see Orientation, the average person would know nothing about the intricate corporate organization of Scientology or the legal implications of what they are agreeing to. Similarly for the attestation that the "application of Scientology's Ethics and Justice technology" is exclusively religious in nature, which I suppose is a nice way of saying "arbitrary, capricious, and beyond the reach of either logic or the courts."
