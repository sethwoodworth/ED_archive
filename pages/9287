YouTube War Expert
[[Image:Soldierwithgun.jpg|thumb|This how a Youtube War Expert thinks he looks like. Still a faggot though.]]
Is it a real soldier? Is it an educated expert? NO! It's the [[YouTube]] War Expert. A YWE is a fat retard with no friends etc... who plays Counter-Strike all day long and thinks he is a qualified marksman. YWEs watch "realistic war" videos (The beach landing from Saving Pvt. Ryan.) and make comments how the Sherman tank was [[OVER 9000]] times better than the Nazi Tiger. In reality both tanks sucked but the Tiger was better because it ran on oil made from jews. Videos from World in Conflict are popular battlefields too, spawning 500 character long comments about how the T72 would have raped the Abrams. When two YWEs meet, some lulz is quick to spawn (with a little help from 3rd parties).
==FORWARD COMRADES, NOT ONE STEPS BACK!==
[[Image:Fatretard.jpg|thumb|This is the real deal. Fit for service indeed. A whole battalion could eat for weeks.]]
Because all Youtube War Experts are 13 year olds with no friends, they lack social skills and  are thus quite easy to troll.
Here is how you do it:
#Type "T72"(or anything related to military) in Search
#Find a "expert" looking comment.
#Reply saying "LOL ABRAMS PWNS T72. T72 SUCKS MAH DICK LOL RUSSIA SUCKS!!11"
#?????
#PROFIT

==Historic quotes of the great leaders==
{{quote|ya, the m16 is moreï»¿ accurate, but that guy didnt adjust for distance, beings that the 7.62 is slower, it drops faster than the 5.56, meaning it needs distance compensation, like rasing the sites. he didnt even have it on the right firing angle for the rear sight. and its funny when he says "primitive" basicly ALL the american pistols and rifles have the same iron sight configuration, minus the height adjuster. i own an Ak47, and an Rpk 47, and i can hit things fine with both|ComradeFenriz, clearly an owner and expert on both guns. }}
