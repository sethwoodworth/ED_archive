==Meaning and use==


'''AFK''' is [[Luser|AOLspeak]] for "Away From Keyboard". It is typically used to inform [[dying_alone|one's online friends]] that one is, well, away from the keyboard, and therefore unable to [[WoW|tank Illidan]]. AFK is different from BRB because it is typically applied to one's profile or avatar after a server has detected a lack of input over a set amount of time. [[BRB]], on the other hand, is used to inform one's online friends that one plans to leave the keyboard, or divert their attention to [[masturbating|another task]]. Therefore, one says BRB when one wishes to go AFK.

==Examples==

[[Party Van|BRB, FBI]] (meaning "Be right back, [[Chris Hansen|the FBI]] is here"). Most often used by [[Pedo|people]] who [[Masturbate|touch themselves]] to pix of naked children. Used commonly on [[4chan]]... [[I'm so confused|oddly enough]].

==Notes==

*In some [[4chan|cultures]] it means [[China|Asia]] For Kids
*9 out of 10 times the user is not actually away from their computer but are furiously [[fap|fapping]] to [[furry|furry pornography]], or just avoiding you because [[you|YOU happen to suck]].
