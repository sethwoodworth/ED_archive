Richard "Ricky" Rodriguez was born into a [[cult]] by name of the "The Children of God" (CoG). The CoG were formed by an esteemed, charismatic uber-troll by name of David Berg. The [[cult]] had simple beginnings where their crazy ass Baptist preacher would preach on the second coming of [[Christ]], amongst other bits of bat-shit insanity. As it moved althrough the late 60's and into the 70's; the dirty hippies he attracted took on a new tone that would set the stage of forthcoming lulz. The sheer magnitude of David Berg's trolling, completely and utterly broke Rodriguez's brain to the point where no amount of [[prozac]] would fix it. The CoG is now known as the Family, presumably to distance themselves from their child brain-washing/raping past.

==The Doctrine==
{{squote|I practice what I preach, and I preach sex, boys and girls, Hallelujah! I say 'fuck' you know what I'm talking about, don't you? Every one of you know except maybe for some of the children but our kids are so smart they even know what that means. We don't think there's anything evil about it. We don't think there's anything wrong with it.|David Berg, [[Pedobear]]'s [[Yoda]]}}

The Doctrine of the CoG was a fairly simple one. Jesus is coming back. And fucking is the way to show how much you love him. People believed this. In their communes it was common place to swap wives, [[pedo|fuck children]], and swap children to fuck with their wives. As such, the children in said communes were raised into believing that having sex with children is normal, commonplace, and an expression of love. The statement to do so was actually called the Law of Love. This is true if you are [[Pedobear]] or [[Joseph Fritzl]]. Otherwise, it can be a bit of a strange and warping experience to those on the receiving end of such fucking. 

In addition, Berg also started a highly effective plan where he would send the women out to bars and other single locations. There they would find someone, introduce them to "free love" and then help them find Jesus. Short of making a sandwich this is by far the epitome of perfection as it comes to the woman's role in the work-place, but most of them did it freely of their own volition to please Berg and Jesus. He often referred to these women as [[truth|"Jesus' whores"]].

Eventually Berg had to go on the run because Interpol was after him for big pimpin'. [[Srs]]ly. So while on the run and moving about, he commanded his acolytes to begin to send him [[CP|strip videos]] featuring the participants in various states. Berg had specific requests for these videos which were usually met by the members of his following, including their children. 

Once Ricky had reached the ripe old age of 12, he was encouraged to [[incest|fuck his mother]]. There would be times where Berg would be nailing the girl that grew up as though she was Ricky's sister, while Ricky would be nailing his mother on the same bed. Free love for [[sick fuck]]s everywhere. The cult swears this sort of thing never happened, but when confronted with the choice of siding with [[pedophile]]s or their victims; well you go with the [[lulz]]. 

This [[pedophilia]] sex-ring existed for about two decades, at least. The CoG is still in existence today but they supposedly protect their children from the dirty pedos. Except they were the dirty pedos. [[divide by zero|Wonder how that works.]]

==The Escape==

At one point, Ricky met another commune member by name of Elixcia. The two ended up falling in love but by that time, David Berg had passed away. (RIP) Ricky's mother, Karen Zerby, had taken over the faith and banned [[pedophilia]] amongst the ranks thanks to STD's and AID's. Which, they weren't black so only [[Jesus]] knows why they were worried about the AID's. She also instituted the rule of the "house of the open pussy", which is basically what it sounds like. If some dude wants to hit it, it's theirs. This did not sit very well for Ricky and Elixcia who finally had had enough to escape to [[America]] and move to Tacoma, Washington. It was there that they apparently knew about some ex-cult members and felt they would be able to get a new life started.

Unfortunately, Ricky's brain by that time had become over-whelmed with rage and anger at the situation. But he managed to form a new life for himself and his new wife where he landed a decent job and was beginning to get de-wired. Then of course, other people fucked it up. Ex-cult members contacted him and told him he had to go forward and lead the crusade against the CoG to get the abuse to stop. That it was his responsibility and that he owed it to them. [[faggotry|Rather than going forward and doing it themselves or anything.]]

Ricky finally could not contain his rage any longer and decided that he simply had to do something about his mother. So he decided to kill her and then kill himself. Being that the CoG had many enemies, she kept her whereabouts very hidden from the general populace. Presumably so she could not be lynched and her corpse molested by [[necrophiliac]]s. The last he heard of her, she had visited grand parents in Tucson, Arizona. So he got a room in a shitty part of the city, found a job as an electrician and waited. 

He arranged a meeting with one Angela Smith to get the information of his mother's whereabouts from her. Angela was a member of the commune and one of his mother's [[whore|closest confidantes]]. 

{{squote|I'm not trained in torture methods which is why I'm going to have to make do. I've got my drill here. The reason why it's got this fucking padding on it is just to try to silence it a bit because I'm in an apartment. I've got a soldering iron, heat. This rather crude implement I think can work wonders especially if it's used in the right way. But I'm not trained. I don't know how to fucking do this. I don't even want to do this. God damn it.|Serious business, he meant it.}}

In the end, the cops believe that she was not tortured but he sure did ginsu the fuck out of her. Jack the Ripper would have been proud. Afterwards he drove to [[California]] and shot himself in the head.

==A Fond Farewell==
When Ricky realized the planets were aligning to aggrandize his moment in the [[lulz]], he stopped to record his thoughts the day before he would become [[an hero]] + one. For almost an hour, he spoke of the reasons behind why he could not go on. It was mostly TL;DW and would best be summarized quite easily.
