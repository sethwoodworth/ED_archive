Fandom wank
{{DISPLAYTITLE:fandom_wank}}
{{needsmoar|Venn diagrams documenting the relationship between wank and lol.}}

A [[JournalFen]]-based [http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/ community] devoted to mocking the stupid in [[fandom]].  [[Something Awful]] for [[fanfic lesbians]].  Basically [[LJ Drama]] except not half as funny.

Fandom Wank also has a ''wiki'', which documents massive amounts of wank, much as ED documents memes and the various low, medium, and high-level lulz. Bearing in mind that most of the people who contribute to Fandom Wank are fanficfags themselves, Fandom Wank might accurately be compared to dwarves making fun of midgets.
