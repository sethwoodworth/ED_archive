'''Andrewpants''' aka Mandrew, Andrewpants, the [[homo]], and [[insane]] [[fag]] was a [[Livejournal]] [[homosexual]] and member of the [[homosexual|Patsy Cline Fan Club]]. He was originally known on [[Livejournal]] as {{lj|the_passives}}, but after [[LJ Abuse]] deleted his account following the [[SALJ]] drama, he switched to Andrewpants. He was the evil genius behind [[Mediacrat|The Great War Against Mediacratâ„¢]] which inevitably led to the creation of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].

He was a [[cunnilingus|cunning linguist]], despite failing to master [[English]], and at last count was fluent in [[Italian]], [[French]] and [[Spanish]] and learning [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[China|Mandarin]]. [[Shit nobody cares about|He spent most of his free time watching reruns of "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit", "Judging Amy", "Six Feet Under", and "The Nanny"]]. 

Andrew, being a fag, lived in the Western Addition district of [[San Francisco]] in a house full of crazy people, including their ringleader [[Nomadlisa]]. He was awaiting the start of [[homosexual|nursing school]] in [[Santa Rosa]].

Andrewpants died in the [[IRL]]. His cause of death was ''undetermined'' which has lead to [[Scientology|many conspiracy theories]], though most suspect a drug overdose. He will be remembered for his gout and [[penis|penile]] elephantiasis. NEVAR FORGET.
