"Politically correct" (formerly known as "[[pussy|Pussified]] [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|Content]]") is a term which denotes language, ideas, policies, and behavior seen as [[pussy troll|seeking to minimize social and institutional offense in occupational, gender, racial, cultural, sexual orientation, religious belief, disability, and age-related contexts]]. 

In current usage, the term is primarily negative, while the term [[truth|politically incorrect has been used as a positive self-description]]. In these cases, the term politically incorrect connotes language, ideas, and behavior unconstrained by a perceived orthodoxy or by concerns about offending or expressing bias regarding various groups of people.

It is commonly abbreviated as "PC." Do not confuse this with the use of "PC" to refer to [[IBM]]'s  computing devices.

In addressing the linguistic problem of naming, [[faggot|Edna Andrews]] says that using [[hir|“inclusive” and “neutral”]] language is based upon the concept that “language represents thought, and may even control thought”. 

[[faggot|Advocates of inclusive language]] defend it as [[BAWW|inoffensive-language]] usage whose goal is multi-fold:

# The rights, opportunities, and freedoms of certain people are restricted because they are reduced to stereotypes.
# Stereotyping is mostly implicit, unconscious, and facilitated by the availability of pejorative labels and terms.
# Rendering the labels and terms socially unacceptable, people then must consciously think about how they describe someone unlike themselves.
# When labeling is a conscious activity, the described person's individual merits become apparent, rather than his or her stereotype.

The usage of such terms is commonly referred to as "political correctness" .

The terms chosen by an identity group, as acceptable descriptors of themselves, then pass into common usage, including usage by the racists and sexists who the terms were made to stop. The formerly inoffensive terms in turn become taboo themselves and must be replaced giving rise to lengthy progressions such as Negro, Colored, Black, Afro-American, African-American.

Some critics claim that political correctness is a [[Communist|Marxist undermining of Western values.]] William S. Lind and Patrick Buchanan have characterized PC as a technique originated by the [[Hitler|Frankfurt School]], through what Buchanan describes as "[[Lenin|Cultural Marxism]]". In The Death of the West, Buchanan says: “[[truth|Political Correctness is Cultural Marxism]], a regime to punish [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|dissent and to stigmatize social heresy]] as the [[cops|Inquisition]] punished [[Black People|religious heresy]]. [[Epic Fail|(Political correctness') trademark is intolerance]].”
