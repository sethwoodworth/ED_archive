Halo Store
Have you ever felt unappreciated? Alone? [[Jack Thompson|Socially unfit]]? We understand, believe us. You can believe us because we have [[In The Ass|seen the light]] - Halo Store. With its jaunty take on life, we now fully understand the [[Felching|reason for existence]].

Created by two of the greatest minds of our generation, Halo Store has captured the imagination of millions - Grunt121, lead vocals, has gone on to lead a successful pornography career, having had a hard time breaking into the pop charts with his a cappella piece, 'Halo Store'. Also known by his real name, <strike>Christian</strike> Crispin, Grunt121 considers himself to be some sort of prophet.
His companion, 'stuart' (aka Stuart Putt of Grunt121 Productions) does all the fantastic video and audio editing work. His voice remained a mystery until Halo Store 2, when it is revealed he has just as [[Mr. Hands|charismatic]] a tone as Grunt.

==Crispin==

Crispin was born and raised in Alabama, America - hence his strong southern drawl. Since early childhood it was clear Crisp was different from the other boys - he suffered from a condition in which lack of testosterone left him pubically bald and with an <strike>unfortunately</strike> hilariously high-pitched voice. Even at the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4fN5xYCPbQ| age of 19 Crispin suffered from this problem.] However, as is evident from the videos themselves, Crispy's voice did break between the first two episodes.

==Stuart==

Stuart is shrouded in mystery. However, what can be ascertained is that before Halo Store, Stu was a [[George Lucas|socially retarded loner]]. Resorting to [[Prostitute|selling his body for sex]] (and later resorting to animal abuse), he continued to [[1guy1jar|slide down into a thick swamp]] of self-dissatisfaction until the release of his [[Semen|seminal]] movie.

Halo Store came to him as a revelation in life - and how he gets all the pussy he could ever want.

==Halo Store 2==
Following the success of their first endeavor, Grunt121 Productions released a sequel to Halo Store - Halo Store 2. This [[Pikmin|two-part beauty]] was to introduce several new features to the series - but also to axe some well loved content, such as the [[Unfunny|constant premium phone line joke]].

==The Future of Halo Store==
Halo Store 3? We can only hope so. At the end of Halo Store 2 it was requested that we join them to help create a new episode. Why not?

We don't fucking know. The vids have gotten [[less than 9000|about 1000]] collective veiws since they were [[at least 100 years ago]]. There is no point to this page actually being here and we suggest that you just disregard it in it's entirety.
