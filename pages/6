(sic)
''This [[article]]'s name is the incorrect due to the technical limitations. The correct title should be [[Shit nobody cares about|something else]].

'''[''sic'']''' is a good way to tell who the [[Grammar Nazi|Cool kids]] are. [''sic''] is the equivalent of quoting someone's post on a message board, just so even if they edit the original post, people can still see that they're a terrible writer. Most often seen on the [[Interbutts]], [''sic''] is also prominent in print media as well. However, if you attempt to use [''sic''] verbally, you are a total jackass. It is also the name of a fucking awful [[Slipknot]] song, leading to its use by their retarded fan base.

== [[Etymology]] ==
=== [''sic''] ===

'''[''sic'']''' is a Latin word meaning 'thus', or loosely translated as 'Check this guy out, he's a [[fucktard]]', placed originally in hand-copied text to indicate that whoever was copying found a spelling error in the original, but has enough sense to preserve that original rather than contribute to grammar nazism, as well as for added [[lulz]]. This proves that lulz have existed as far back as the dark ages, when they were had by early prototype wiki-vandals at [[MONGO]]'s distant ancestors. It carried over into the [[internets]], where it's used to judiciously place the fucktard label on the illiterate asshat that wrote what you're posting, instead of on you.

'''[''sic'']''' is also a backronym for '''s'''pelled '''i'''n '''c'''ontext or '''s'''aid '''i'''n '''c'''opy.

In general, used to indicate that you are [[intelligent people can spell|smarter than another person because you can spell]].

=== SIC ===
'''SIC''' is also an acronym for '''s'''pelling '''i'''s '''c'''onfusing.  It is used to indicate that someone has mispelt a word in a manner that renders its meaning obscure.  (This usage is extremely rare.)

=== S.I.C. ===
'''S.I.C.''' Stands for Super Imaginative Chogokin, basically Darker crazier looking versions of Japanese Super Heroes in action figure forms that you can exchange the parts of. They cost a shit load of money and only obsessive [[wapanese]] and even some [[Japanese]] buy.

=== C.I.S.===

'''C.I.S.''' as in [[Star Wars|Confederation of Independent Systems]].

=== Sick ===
'''SIC''' is not the same as [[sick fuck|sick]] unless it is unintentionally applied in that sense, in which case the use of either or both of the earlier two applications may be appropriate.

=== Seek ===
'''Seek''' eez wheeen Jew aargh eeeteeeng too muuuch tortillas. Ay, caramba!

=== Suck ===
Please see [[fellatio]].

== How to use [''sic''] ==
During arguments on the [[internet]] people will inevitably 'quote' portions of each other's words back to them, whether to identify what portions they are directly responding to, or to remove them from their supporting context to directly mock them.  Any time someone makes a spelling mistake, or [[typo]], you should always append '''[''sic'']''', in bold, to show that you have included their ''mis''spelling in your quote.  This strengthens your argument due to it being [[common knowledge]] on the internet that [[intelligent people can spell]].
