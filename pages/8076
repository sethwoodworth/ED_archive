'''Teh''' has been used ever since people found out that misspelling words and pretending to sound [[gay|cool]] is [[faggotry|uncalled for]] (or just plain [[fucktarded]]) and will make you sound like a [[fucktard]], hence fucktarded. Teh [[moar]] you say teh, teh [[moar]] of a rotten [[fag]] you become.

Though teh word itself is still full of [[4chan|fail]] people still use it as a way of showing a juvenile excitement towards teh subject matter. Originally a misspelling of "[[the]]" but also adds a childish tone to teh word, and puts across a more innocent feel to teh subject. [[shit_nobody_cares_about|It has the ability to turn nearly any word into a noun.]]
