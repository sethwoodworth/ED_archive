Tyrannosaurus Reich
[[Image:TReich1.jpg|thumb|Tyrannosaurus Reich: ridding the world of Jews, one scumbag at a time.]]

Tyrannosaurus Reich is a nazi dinosaur from [[an hero|an super hero]] comic put out by DC Comics. He was introduced to planet Earth via a [[portal]] to rid Jew filth from the world, but was quickly driven back to his home planet by a [[cat]] who could [[Longcat|change sizes when it was agitated]]. This boring plot twist would have been good if the [[dinosaur]] has actually succeeded in wiping out the [[Adolf Hitler|filthy Jewish race]], but he instead failed to beat [[Holocaust|Hitler's high score]] and ended up [[fail]]ing miserably, resulting in him appearing in only one comic issue.

Not to be confused with [[TyrannoSatan]], but equally as [[gay]].
