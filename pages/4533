Kemonomimi
'''Kemonomimi''' is a [[Weeaboo]] term used for an [[animu]] character that has animal ears and possible tail, paws, and eyes. Basically, it's a [[catgirl]] only made from other faggy animals and not just cats, and possibly [[gay|male]], too. 

Other terms include: Kemono or [[Furry]] [[fag|light]] or simply adding "mimi" to the name of various Japanese animals (I.E. nekomimi, inumimi, kitsunemimi, usagimimi etc.)

==OMG Kawaii!!==

In Japan, Kemono characters typically are used when the artists either...

a) Wants a cop-out to avoid drawing real [[furry|furries]] and being labeled a [[fag|Dishonorable Pervert]]

b) Want to make a creature look more alien without making it look like [[goatse]].

c) Are using the animal traits as a "mark" to show [[pwned|something is wrong with the character]]. 

Weeaboo do not get this and think that is just is so [[cute|KAWAII]]!!! It has become a habit for [[nerds|fans of anime]] to add [[Cat]] Ears to their characters, and even to themselves in an attempt to make everything look UBER [[OMG]] [[Kawaii|KAWAII]]. Other reasons why Weeaboo misuse Kemono characters include:

a) They are trying to [[traced|hide a trace]]

b) Are making their own [[Mary Sue|awesome original character]] from a cannon character.

c) Have [[aspergers|something seriously]] [[Otherkin|wrong with]] the [[traced|Artist]].

d) Any possible combination of the above, or...

e) all of the above!

Most of these people inhabit typical [[otaku]] hangouts such as [[Gaia]], [[DeviantART]] and [[Smackjeeves]] where they sit in an eternal [[masturbation|circle-jerk]] over each other's [[shitty]] artwork while occasionally squealing "KAWAII!!! =^.^= "

Kemonomimi such as [[Catgirls]] are popular in both [[Anime]] and [[Hentai]].

Some characters, such as [[loli|Sakura]] from ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura]]'' as often dressed with [[fake]] animal ears, making them "fake" Kemonos, though [[retarded]] fanbois don't know the difference. In fact, some retarded [[fanboi]]s even think that strapping on fake ears and paw gloves makes them a [[o rly|for-reals]] furry because of these misconceptions (see [[fursuit]] for more information). 

Other characters like [[shota|Ritsuka]] from ''[[yaoi|Loveless]]'' and over half the cast of [[Inuyasha]], were born with animal parts, making them real Kemonomimi. These are the [[alien]]s and [[pwned|cursed fuckers]] we mentioned earlier. [[Furry|Sick Fucks]] love masturbating to these and create [[shitty|lovingly-made]] artwork such as the [[porn|art]] to the right.

Video games are also not exempt from the Kemono tide of ears and tails. ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games have been known for having at least one token [[furry]] in each of their games, often a kemonomimi such as [[slut|Fran]] or the ever-popular [[catgirl|Mithras]].
Felicia, a famous [[Capcom|Crapcom]] character and a fan-favorite of most [[13-year-old-boys]] and the [[cosplay]] of ever [[fat]] [[gay|fangirl]] evar.
