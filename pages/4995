<b>Luca Shoal</b>, also known as <b>Darkfire826</b>, <b>cheshire_rabbit826</b>, or <b>invaderluca</b>, is not only a [[Babyfur|babyfur]], but also a [[Gay|homosexual]],  [[Transsexual|crossdresser]],  [[Plushophiles|plushophile]],  [[Zoophile|zoophile]], and, last but not least, strives to be [[The_Cancer_That_Is_Killing_/b/|the cancer that is killing /b/]]. Luca not only has the nerve to call himself a [[kill yourself|"/b/abyfur"]], but also likes to tell trolls to [[INTERNET_HATE_MACHINE|buy curtains and a dog.]]

While the [[Patriotic Nigras]] were trolling Raven Welesa, a former US intelligence analayst turned [[Babyfur|babyfur]], they  encountered Luca Shoal under the name InvaderLuca on livejournal, as he jumped in to help defend a fellow babyfur. His constant meme-spewing and insults were enough provocation to earn him the full attention of the Nigras, which resulted in his name, phone number, address, his [[Childlove|darkest]] [[Zoophile|secrets]] as well as information on his family all becoming exposed. 


==The Real Luca==
[[IRL]], Luca Shoal is a [[Fail|loner]] with an empty facebook, He eventually left his parents basement in Ohio for Pennsylvania in order to attend The Art Institute of Pittsburgh, where he had taken a liking to cooking classes. His parents and family know about his babyfur-tendencies, and are therefore most likely dead inside, however, they don't know about Luca's posts on beastforum. Further information on Luca Shoal can be found [[http://de.pastebin.ca/907569 here.]]

==Cancer killing The Internet==

===Chans===

This [[Babyfur|freak of nature]] constantly spews [[Meme|memes]] in a way that would even make a *chan newfag rage. He claims to be part of [[Anonymous]], talks about the chans ([[4chan|4]] and [[7chan|7]] usually) constantly on his profiles, and generally kisses the asses of anyone chan-related that he can, as long as they're not anti-furry or trolls in general. Ironically, he's also known to associate with aspiring [[Anti-lulz|lulzkillers]] such as [http://yaoifan.deviantart.com/ Yaoifan.] 

===ED===

As if it wasn't enough to infect the chans with his presence, he began associating himself with ED when he discovered his picture in the [[Babyfur|babyfur]] article. Though he has been banned simply for being noticed, and there have been pictures mocking his faggotry on ED for over a year, which he has failed to remove, he still attempts to associate with EncyclopediaDramatica.
