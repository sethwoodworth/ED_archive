Wooden table
[[Image:Woodentable.jpg|thumb|A [[photoshop]]ped [[screencap]] of a [[website]] that in one of its frames has an image of a scanned photograph of a printout of a flyer created in [[Word]] (that has the information needed on the page) layed on a wooden table]]
The requirement of a '''wooden table''' in any development process is a [[meme]] from [http://thedailywtf.com The Daily WTF]. The basic process of using a wooden table was described in the [[OP|original post]] which can be found [http://thedailywtf.com/forums/thread/72344.aspx here].

== The Wooden Table Process ==

#Using your favorite word processing software, design a flyer that contains the information you'd like to convey to your [[website]] visitor
#Once designed, print the flyer on a color printer
#Lay the printed sheet of paper face-up on a table, preferably a clean, wooden table
#Take a photograph of the flyer using a [[camera]], preferably a digital
#Download and print (or develop) the photograph of the flyer
#With a normal scanner, scan the photograph of the flyer
#[[Upload]] the scanned image to a frame on your website

==[[Meme]]tical Usage==

In [[comments]] on The Daily WTF content, often suggestions will be made such as "print out the source code, lay it on a wooden table, take a picture..."

[[Some argue]] that any program that makes it out of [[beta]] will involve a wooden table at some point.
