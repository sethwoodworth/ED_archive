'''France''' is a tourist [[trap]] in [[Europe]]. It has a long history of allowing [[Nazis]] to set up puppet governments. But the rest of their history is shameful, with repeated defeats, conquests, and surrenders. The French under Napoleon III presented the United States with the Statue of Liberty -- an intended [[Buttsecks|trojan horse ambush]] gone wrong. The vast majority of French men are sex addicts, [[Tom Cruise|in the closet]] and/or [[Libtard|champagne socialists]]. The most common thing a frenchman will say during his life is "what proof do you have that i am full of shit"? France is most famous for enacting legislation [[banning]] [[women]] from shaving their armpits, which was then enthusiastically imported by the horrifyingly [[hirsute]] [[Italians]]. 

The French [[Homosexuals|upper class]] are unbelievably [[racist]] and detest [[Arabs]] as well as anyone who is not French. They revel in trolling anyone who couldn’t inherit [[insane]] amounts of Daddy’s [[gold]]. The reason for this [[Lunix|elitist]] behaviour is quite simple and similar to that of [[Tony Blair|British snobbishness]]: both countries once had impressive [[Penises|empires]], but now have only [[Micropenises|tiny swaths of land]]. Modern France has even less of a say on the international stage than [[Finland]], who copied the French style of [[government]] and then [[1337|did better than them at everything]].

== Le Demographie ==

France should be entirely inhabited by [[Bohemian]] [[douchebag]]s, however due to former colonialist ambitions, a disturbingly large (and growing) proportion of the populace is [[poor]], [[Muslim]] and [[pregnant]]. They all live either in Paris as existentialists or in the countryside as peasants.

France is, by definition, a [[failed]] state. It is populated primarily by frogs, [[pussies]] and [[Muslims]]. French is the language of most people, simply because they think that an unpopular language spoken by [[less than 9000]] people keeps their laughable global image consistent.

== Le Culture ==
[[Image:Dongs france vs usa vs japan.jpg|thumb|left|When there's nothing you can be proud of, you can still fake penis graphs.]]
[[Image:French_toiletpaper.jpg|thumb|A gay French using properly the toilet paper.]]

France has suffered quietly under the tyranny of an arcane, outdated language, which only the [[elderly]] snobs of Mésnilmontant bothered to speak "properly". It is often hard to learn, because of the tendency to hear yourself sound like a douche. Since the French eventually started using condoms and stopped having children. Presently, the most spoken language in France is [[Arabic]]. 

Once known as Gaul, the French retaliated against their former [[Roman Empire|Roman tyrants]], and introduced cuisine based on butter and cream onto Europe, rather than the ancient "olive oil and anything" Roman dining habit.

[[Sick fuck|French men]] are either [[Faggots|anorexic pseudo-intellectual]] [[Liberals|art or literature students]] with tiny, oiled mustaches who are called Pierre, or simply [[Basement dweller|middle-aged and overweight]]. French women are superior to [[American|American]] [[women]] in every way, except for the [[Hirsute|leg/armpit hair]] and their obsession with climbing the social ladder. Most French people are Communists and have [[You|odd]] tongue fetishes. They only shave their faces so there is no difference between French men and French women, they both have excessive body hair and it is against the law to shave. All French people and all people who have ever been to France are neither male or female, just one neutral gender.

The most famous French cartoons  is ''Asterix'', about a tribe of hut-dwelling peasants who are good enough soldiers to [[irony|defeat the Romans]] - the French don't recognize that this is a parody of their [[IRL]] [[fail]].

Be aware that if you eat snails and frog legs like the French do, [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|YOU WILL LOOK LIKE A TOOL!]]

France, as a humble country, views itself as "the mother of Arts, Military Tradition, and Laws", which can't be more true. As a result, eons of cultural excellence concretized in total world musical supremacy, as shown below.

== Le Sport ==
[[Image:Frenchfootballteam.jpg|thumb|The French national soccer team is mostly made up of [[niggers]].]] 

France is generally shitty at most [[sports]], since copious [[wine]], [[chain-smoking]] and subsisting on loaves of cheese and butter-saturated bread are not particularly conducive to athletic prowess. However, the French [[soccer]] team, despite having the sponsor of '[[Fag|Le Coq Sportif]]', did manage to win the World Cup in 1998, causing much [[butthurt]] to the [[Brazilian]] team which at the time consisted of Ronaldo + 10. The French national team got to the [[2006]] World Cup finals, but lost to [[Italy]]. However, they gained international fame via the explosive [[rage]] of 2006 Golden Ball winner and French national hero [[Zinedine Zidane]]. Zidane arguably takes some responsibility for the loss, but the violence with which he drilled his skull into the shit-talking, Italian chest of Marco Materazzi almost makes up for centuries of French failure on the [[battlefield]].

[[Image:Zidane_headbutt.gif|thumb|Zinedine Zidane demonstrates typical French sportsmanship.]] 

{{quote|You are ''also a man of heart and conviction.<br>That is why France admires and loves you.|'''French President Jacques Chirac'''<br>speaking ''after'' [[Zidane]] annihilated Materazzi with a violent coup-de-tête}}

France has fallen far following Zidane's retirement. [[Scotland]] managed to [[pwn]] them both times [[Wikipedia:UEFA_Euro_2008_qualifying_Group_B|during the qualifiers for Euro 2008]].

As for rugby, French [[scientists]] did manage to create the ultimate rugby player, Sébastien Chabal, out of pieces of deceased rugby players from other nations who are actually talented at sports. To date, no one has noticed that he is held together with skin grafts and superglue.

The ''Tour de France'' [[biking]] race is the best known French sporting events in the [[United States]]. Although most Americans are too [[fat]] to consider getting on a bike, much less find a bike seat that could possibly accomodate their enormous asses, the steroid-enhanced domination of Lance Armstrong brought biking into the limelight. Sadly, the French fail at their own bicycle race: a Frenchman hasn't won the Tour de France since 1985. 

Currently, the most [[popular]] French sport and a source of immense French pride (after being shown for almost 90 seconds in a James Bond movie) is ''[[parkour]]'' - a highly advanced sport based on the ancient French tradition of running away as fast as one possibly can.

== Le Irak ==

When [[Iraq]] got pwned by Americans and their friends the first time, Hussein got all [[butthurt]] about it, especially since France participated in exchange for Jew money. When the French Army went into action, they only lost two guys, and the starving, exhausted, and flea-ridden Iraqi conscripts surrendered to them by the hundreds. This may be the only time in history that France was on the winning side of a mass surrender. After the war, Saddam wanted France to protect him against the evil Americans. All [[oil]] contracts in the country were awarded to France. In exchange, France started bugging the World about how evil USA and Israel were. In 2003, Americans finally had enough of that crap, and pwnd Iraq the second time. They first tried to politely ask France to contribute moar forces, with the French politely telling the USA to go fuck itself.

The good thing is that now the French didn't have to pretend to like [[Arabs]] and dislike the United States and Israel. So they started by electrocuting an Arab and a black person in a transformer box and then picked a pro-American half-Jew as their President.

The origins of France are lost in a sea of [[incest]], [[cunnilingus]], red wine and nuclear testing. They have spent their entire existence being the bitches of various empires throughout [[history]].

Modern archaeology has proven that pre-Roman France was a swampland. Remnants of this swamp-dwelling race can be seen in their practice of eating snails and frogs.

The Vikings managed to randomly conquer Northern France, calling it Normandy, after the French were once again taken completely by surprise.  This only added insult to injury in their long and illustrious history of getting their asses kicked by everyone evar.

During the Renaissance, the [[Spanish]] were constantly at war with France. Because Spain's riflemen didn't run whenever they saw a comrade killed, French was overrun twice by the Spanish troops, resulting in [[win|two whole generations of French nobility being completely wiped out]] during this period. 

The French lost [[Quebec]] to the English in the Seven Years War, but they killed English General James Wolf. The English responded by killing French General Montcalm. Shortly afterward, the French were faced with a slave rebellion in [[Haiti|Saint-Domingue]], the first succesful slave revolt (who better than the French, [[amirite]]?), although the French killed ''a lot'' of niggers. Apparently the colonial elites [[obvious|saw nothing wrong with a slave-settler ratio of 20 to 1]]. France was so butthurt from the loss that they practically gave away the much larger and far less malaria-infested [[Louisiana|Louisiana Territory]] to the United States.

During [[World War I]] the [[French]] almost lost Paris to the Germans, but managed to beat them off at the last second. For the rest of the war, they only managed to hold off Germany to a stalemate with the help of the English. The WWI version of [[Stalingrad]] happened when the Germans tried to take the French town of Verdun. The French put everything they had into winning the Battle, and the Germans eventually pulled back. The French lost half a million, Germans lost a quarter of a million. The French and their Allies continued to be under constant German pressure. Then the [[United States]] came in and saved the day - just like America has in every other important war to date.

In World War II, France was conquered entirely in ten minutes by the Nazis. The French [[cried]] again and Hitler, embarrassed by their tears, let them have a little bit of land for themselves. Despite this, the French still think they are better than the English, despite requiring [[over 9000]] tons of help from the UK and USA, and being liberated by their armies, and using only British and American equipment. During this invasion, the French Navy escaped to the port of Mers el-Kebir in one of their African colonies. The British sent a naval task force to get the French to either join the Allies or be blown out of the water. Admiral [[Idiot|Marcel Gensoul]], who said he wanted to preserve the [[lolwut|honor of France]] but was infact a Nazi-lover, made his fleet fight. In the engagement, the British lost 2 guys, the French lost 1,297 guys. The French gave a half-assed response by bombing some British bases in Africa and Gibraltar. 

Meanwhile, the French set up a resistance movement which fought a fierce insurgent campaign against the Germans, and helped out [[D-Day]]. Frenchies will never stop trolling about how brave their own resistance men were if you ask them about their defeat, but whenever arguing with one, keep in mind that only a couple thousand French were in the resistance, and 20% of them were not ethnically French, but Jews, who hated the Nazis more than the French did. A lot of the French made a Nazi puppet government called Vichy France, and sent soldiers to help fight Allies alongside the Germans. So for the most part, the French fought for the Germans. Mentioning this is guaranteed to instantly create an epic shitstorm among Frenchmen.

=== Empires That The French Have Defeated ===

Way back in French [[history]], Charlemagne, the [[Man points|most manly]] Frenchman who ever lived, probably because he was German, conquered a bunch of [[Europe]] and fathered all of the sad [[liberals]] who would run the lands there and pester the world forever. The Ancient French king Charles Martel also defeated the Moors at Tours and prevented white people from worshipping [[Muhammad]].

Amazingly, the French managed to take down Italy during [[WWII]]. Even though they had the full support of Nazi Germany, which was at that time invading France, an Italian force which tried to invade France was booted out by the French, led by General [[Fag|Rene Olry]]. Italians lost 631, French lost 40. 

The French only managed to defeat [[England]] in one (Battle of Hastings, 1066, [[Fail|L2P]]) war, under the leadership of a terrifying [[loli]] named Joan of Arc. The English decided that France was too rebellious anyway, and gladly left to return home to their own [[depressing]], gray, rainy country -- but not before [[Kill it with fire|burning Joan of Arc alive]] for being a [[schizophrenic]] [[lesbian]]. Throughout the next centuries, the French fought all of their European neighbors. They hardly ever managed to defeat the British, however.

In the 1800s, King [[Napoleon]] who ruled France actually used his brilliant military strategies, and France conquered most of Europe, even the [[Germany|Germans]]. This can be easily explained: Napoleon was not born in France, but on the island of Corsica. Therefore, he was better able to lead French soldiers than their retarded generals. Unfortunately, the French Empire eventually lost its captured territories and never managed to conquer Britain and [[Russia]], and Napoleon was exiled back to his shit island. He escaped, however, and re-organized the French, who attacked the English in the Battle of Waterloo. [[lulz|Thousands died on both sides]], but the French were pwnt, and Napoleon was sent to some crappy Pacific Island and poisoned. 

[[At least 100 years ago|During the 1800s]] the French successfully invaded and conquered Algeria to avoid paying a debt. This was accomplished simply because the local Arabs were dirt [[poor]] and didn't have [[shoes]]. Upset with western-style freedom and prosperity, the Arabs went [[jihad]] and scared away [[Over 9000|over 1 million]] ''[[wigger|Pied-Noir]]''. Meanwhile, [[Zimbabwe|Rhodesia]] had less than one-third of that many whites but at least they [[badass|stuck it out]] until the [[genocide|bitter end]].

The French pwnt [[Vietnam]] in the late 1800s, and enforced a [[Holocaust|brutal occupation]] against the indigenous people. When [[World War II|WWII]] came around, [[Japan]] snatched Vietnam from them, but after the war, they went in and recaptured it. The Vietnamese, led by [[Commie|Ho Chi Minh]], fought a [[gorilla|guerilla]] war against the French. The French killed hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, a lot of them innocent women and children, and forced a lot of men to fight for them, but they lost when the Vietnamese gooks besieged and defeated one of their forts at [[Moonspeak|Dien Bien Phu]]. The French killed 8,000 gooks, and lost 2,000 of their own. However, two weeks later, some raggedy-ass gook fighters ambushed and almost wiped out a French armored column: Vietnamese lost 100, French lost 500. The French were so butthurt that they gave Vietnam to the [[America|Jewmericans]] to deal with.

The French have tried to re-establish their colonial Empire in Africa. Their secret service [[murder|deals with]] any African leader who dares to resist them, and they reward their good nigger slaves by sending in massive military forces to keep their puppets in power. These  are there solely to protect their corrupt and wild puppet governments from their disenchanted populations, and to beat back any guerillas that dare to threaten French-imposed instability. This is failing, are more and more [[civil war]]s are taking place. 

One notable example of French hegemony in Africa is in Cote d'Ivoire, when that country's raggedy-ass Air Force bombed a French Army "peacekeeping" camp by mistake. Te French "peacekeepers" then counterattacked and destroyed two Ivorian jets. The French then sent in thousands of reinforcements that occupied the capital, destroyed the entire Ivorian air force on the ground, and mowed down 60 people attempting to protest. 

Their Army's "peacekeepers" (moar liek [[piss]]keepers, [[amirite]]?) are in [[UN]] forces around the world, generating [[profit]]s for France. They are best known for their service in [[Lebanon]]. [[Israel]] wanted the UN to stop terrorist Hezbollah and bring peace, but the French want to show the Arabs that they are [[not|neutral]], so they protect Hezbollah from the Jews, and then got all butthurt when an Israeli jet flew within two miles of their frigate ''Courbet''. 

The French Navy has succesfully pwnt [[Somalia|Somali] pirates. In two cases, pirates hijacked French yachts, the French navy freed them up. One time, it pwnt 2 pirates and captured 3, and then captured 6. Its attempts to look badass, however, [[fail]]ed when pirates executed a hostage, since the French had apparently not heard their threats to kill hostages if attacked, so they sent boats with commandos out in plain sight with guns blazing. Then, piraes attacked a French Navy tanker at night. Maybe they though it was a merchant ship, or maybe they knew it was a French ship and assumed that the crew would surrender. Instead, it was the ship which shot at them, and then chased them away andd made some of them surrender, but rather than killing them and making an example, they took them to France, where they were most likely given a slap on the wrist and told to go home.

One of their proudest achieveents was when they blew up some crappy [[Greenpeace]] boat in [[New Zealand]] for protesting their use of nuclear testing on small fluffy animals. The bombs were labeled "[[Fucktard|Made in France]]". Most of the perpetrators got away, but the leaders, Commander [[Retard|Alain Mafart]] and Captain [[Slut|Dominique Prieur]] were caught in about ten minutes and then promptly [[Bubba|raped in the ass]] in the worst [[prison]] the government could possibly find. The bombing resulted in one dead journalist for New Zealand, and 20+ years of shame and [[butthurt]] for France. France was bawwing to no end, and even threatened to use its influence in the [[EU]] to force sanctions on New Zealand, until the New Zealanders finally agreed to send the two prisoners to France on condition that France detain them in a military base for three years as punishment. The French subsequently broke their promise and released them after 2 years.

=== Napoléon ===
[[Image:frenchprez.jpg|thumb|right|Napoleon I, current President of France.]]

Napoleon was born on an island off the coast of Italy. Despite the fact he was [[Italian]], he is hailed as the greatest "French"  general of all time. Napoleon [[pwned]] basically everyone in mainland [[Europe]] but was stopped dead by [[Russia]]. The French Empire under Napoleon finally collapsed after getting [[pwned]] by the [[English]] (yet again) during the battle of Waterloo. 

=== [[Liars|Mensonges]] ===
[[Image:Soldierofsurrender.jpg|thumb|right| The official magazine of the French Army.]]

The French like to think they invented [[democracy]] and [[philosophy]], but this is a [[lie]] bred by their lust for fame and respect. In [[fact]], the American [[George Washington]] invented freedom over 200 years ago. Before that point, freedom did not exist and anyone who claimed to be free was lying. lol the americans did not create democratic freedom that is stated here, the greeks actually invented democracy and the americans created a bastard child between the french and english moral ethics, codes and laws.

The most significant French invention to date is the [[condom]]. According to the [[Pope]] this helps spread [[AIDS]] in [[Africa]], contibuting to the [[final solution|solution]] by presenting one of the most effective forms of population control.

== Le [[Religion]] ==
[[File:Niqab-france.jpg|thumb|right|[[Banhammer|Veils are now forbidden in public]]...]]
[[File:Nicolas Sarkozy.jpg|thumb|right|....and underneath lurks OH SHI-]]
Like most of the European Union, France is a relatively-[[secular]]ized and otherwise [[Judaism|Abr]][[Christianity|aha]][[Islam|mic]] society. However, France achieves an epic win - perhaps the only one in its history - in its treatment of [[Scientology]].  Unlike the [[Fucking|borderline]] [[retards|vegetables]] determining tax-exempt status in the [[United States]] and those [[pussies]] in [[Germany]] that just couldn't [[IRL ban|finish]] [[Scientology|the job]], France not only refuses to accept [[Scientology]] as a legitimate [[religion]], but [[Wikipedia:Scientology_as_a_state-recognized_religion#France|officially classifies the Church of Scientology as a cult.]] For once, French public outrage is fruitfully directed towards this bullshit and a May 2009 fraud trial may result in the French Co$ being [[PWND|forced to dissolve]].

==Le Law==

The French secretly sneak in a new law every now and again to catch out [[Americans|sex tourists]], notably it is now mandatory [http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060619123416AA9XNxC] for every person to wear Speedos in public at all times in France, especially when naked.

==Le Islam==

It is not a secret that the French hate [[Islam|muslisms]], but then, who doesn't ? Their most recent troll of [[islam]] is their [[B&]] of veils in public, which caused millions of butthurt muslisms across Europe to start their bombpacks in a means of '[[Pyro|non-violent protest]]' to combat the [[Lulz|injustice]]. If you get caught wearing a veil in public you automatically have [[aids]] and are deported to [[Africa]], for a better quality of life.

== Le [[Politics|Politique]] ==

The result of the [[2007]] Presidential elections:

[[File:Freedom_sarkozy-bruni.jpg|thumb|right|The beauty and the shorty]]

It is common knowledge that the current French president, Nicolas Sarkosy, is a Jew. As of 2009, the certified [[mental defective]] Nicholas Sarkozy has expressed plans to overturn a law that has been in place for ([[seriously]]) [[At least 100|104]] years that might allow the Church of $cientology to [http://www.ccmm.asso.fr/spip.php?article1797 receive state funding].

== Le [[Economy|Économie]] ==

France maintains its place in the international economy by being the single greatest exporter of the following goods:

# Fake Pinot Noir [[Wine]] to giant wine company E & J Gallo
# Mimes (deaf/mute [[gothy]] [[emos]])
# Appeasement packages (so [[America]], [[Germany]] and/or [[England]] don't beat the shit out of them)
# Phallic buildings
# [[welfare]] checks, the French hardly fucking work!

* Ask for a directions how to go to that.. big tower... how do you call it?
* Mention how Napoleon was Corsican and NOT French. Being Corsican makes one about as French as being Puerto Rican or Panamanian makes one American.
* Tell them that portraying [[Rape|Pepe Le Pew]] as a Frenchman is an insult to skunks.
* Mention that the gypsies they hate so much, such as Django Reinhardt, were/are all phenomenally better musicians than any frog Frenchman.
* Attack a subway train driver. The labor union will start a week long strike, paralyzing the entire city in order to get extra security. Best done just before [[GTFO|taking a plane out of the country]].
* Tell them all the superfluous consonants and vowels in their written language arose from [[retard|illiteracy]].
* [[pwn|Take a vacation and be a complete jackass to everyone you see. Blow smoke in their faces, steal groceries out of their shopping carts, and sexually harrass/assault them. At the end of your trip, exclaim, "NOW YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN WE SEE YOU FUCKERS IN ASPEN!"]]
* Announce that [[Sweden|Swedes]] make better food.
* Ask them if they've ever engaged in coprophilic acts. If they say no, tell them to stop lying.
* Speak loudly in [[English]] about how [[dumb]] the French are.
* If anyone tries to speak to you in English, laugh at their crappy accent.
* [[Wapanese|Point excitedly at various groups of Frenchman and take pictures of them.]] Wear a fanny pack and an ''[[I]] [[heart|<3]] [[New York City|NY]]'' tee-shirt for maximum lulz.
* At rush hour in the transports, when everyone is pushing to get into the wagon and just before the door closes, give a big shove at the last person who got in. You won't see it, but intense and short-range [[drama]] will ensue until the next station.
* A variant when you are in a busy wagon. Reach and fondle the ass of a woman as far as possible from you. For best results, said woman should be in front of a [[fat]] man. Watch and laugh as drama ensures.
* Deposit dog shit in front of doors and subway exits. Watch as Parisians deftly avoid them and tourists walk on them and become red with anger. Often they will bump into others, generating [[Mantrain|chain]]-[[drama]].
* Say that Luc Besson makes [[awesome]] movies.
* Find five other people and set up a demonstration about anything and inform the [[police]]. 200 cops will be immediately dispatched to block half of the fucking town to let you demonstrate.
* Find any of the squares and shoot the pigeons. You will piss off [[old people]] that will swear at you in [[Redneck|backwater]] French. 
* If in a traffic jam, start hooting. Soon enough, every other Frenchman will be hooting. Whether they do it simply by [[retarded]] mimicry or to stop the others from hooting depends on how retarded the Frenchman in question is.
* The ultimate form of [[trolling]] at a public transport station is to block the exits by attempting to get in that way. The doors will close, trapping everyone inside.
* ''For [[women]] only:'' Hang around the Eiffel Tower all day and inform anyone within earshot that [[Feminism|it is a chauvinist phallic symbol]] and does not represent French ingenuity but rather their [[Micropenis|tiny dicks]].
* Stand on a street corner letting passerbys know that you throughly approve of Sarkozy.
* Request ketchup with your meal at a French restaurant.

Following the [[Tubgirl|horrific]] [[drama|tragedy]] of [[9/11]] and France's subsequent decision to side with the [[terrorists]], [[George W. Bush]] discovered that the word ''French'' was actually the [[linguistic]] equivalent of an IED: an [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] alternative to '''[[Freedom]]''' that had been inserted into [[English|The Perfect International Language]] by Taliban spies. As a good, God-fearing Amerric'n, G.W. knew that The Lord required of him to [[Censorship|force-feed]] linguistic revisionism to the sinful American people, as:

: '''MEANS''': ''Please speak English, I do not understand.''
