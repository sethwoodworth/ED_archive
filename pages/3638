Haters Make Me Famous
[[File:Hitler_makes_you_famous.jpg|thumb|HA HA HATERS MAKE ME FAMOUS!!!]]

'''Haters Make Me Famous''' (also known as '''[[Twitter|#hatersmakemefamous]]''') is a common phrase used by people who have somehow felt [[butthurt|wronged]] for being made fun of for their retarded behavior, but [[attention whore|appreciate the attention you give them anyway]]. Usually a comeback against the constant trolling of their beliefs, artwork, music and so forth, classic usage was limited to [[DeviantArt|Tartlets and "models"]], and the occasional autistic on [[TOW]]. However, the recent resurgence of '''HMMF''' has been spreading into the music community amongst the [[Juggalo]], the [[Scene|Scenefag]], and even the [[Goth]] as a means of protecting their [[Blood on the Dance Floor|shitty]], [[ICP|shitty]], [[Owl City|HORRENDOUSLY SHITTY]] [[BrokeNCYDE|bands]], [[Justin Bieber|artists]], or [[Crunkcore|culture]] [[Emo|that]] [[Retro|should've died]] [[Scene|ages ago]].

==Causes and Symptoms==
Those who believe haters make them famous don't understand the difference between being famous and infamous. In the world of celebrity (particularly shitty [[Paris Hilton|IRL celebrities]] and shitty [[Perez Hilton|OL celebrities]]), ANY form of attention is good attention.

The need to be loved by people who live only to beat the living shit out of them is a major symptom of several severe mental disorders - namely [[histrionic personality disorder]], [[Narcissistic personality disorder]], [[psychopathy]] and increasingly [[Aspergers syndrome]]. [[Some argue|Others believe]] they dwell more on their haters rather than their fans because their haters pay more attention to them than their fans do.

==As a Form of [[Trolling]]==
[[File:ED Haters Make Me Famous.gif|thumb|It's true.]]
"Haters make me famous!" is the mantra of all successful trolls, for without haters trolls would not exist. As such trolls aim to gather haters [[irony|even more than the bitchy pseudo-celebs they are trolling]]. A few may rightly ask why saying "Haters make me famous!" is only teh kewl when trolls say it, or what the difference is between a l33t [[epic]] troll and a shameless [[attention whore]].

[[It is a mystery|Probably none.]]
