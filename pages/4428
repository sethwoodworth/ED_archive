Joy Division
[[Image:177208230 af81395be7.jpg|thumb|right|Typical Joy Division [[ugly|Fan]]]]
Joy Division was a [[goth|post-punk]] [[england|British]] band from [[at least 100 years ago]]. There were four members but no one cares about any of them except [[an hero|Ian Curtis]]. The band took their name from a book about [[WWII]], the joy division being a group of Jew women kept alive to work in concentration camp [[rape|brothels]]. Because of this connection, Joy Division were often accused of being [[nazi|Nazi]]-sympathizers. They probably were.
[[Art school]] students love Joy Division because art school students love old, [[scene|"obscure"]], depressing music/music they can [[cutting|cut]] to.

==Ian Curtis==
After releasing one album, finishing another, and doing European tours, Ian Curtis hung himself in 1980. This was presumably because of the [[angst|stress]] of sudden success, having a hot foreign mistress but an [[emo|angry]] [[fat|frumpy]] wife, and severe [[epilepsy]]. Most of that sucks, except for the hot foreign [[whore|mistress]] part. In all likeliness, he did it for the same reason [[Hitler]] killed himself: [[I did it for the lulz|for the lulz]]. The next day, his estranged wife came home and discovered his body and she got scared and said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air." He was then cremated, as most WWII [[Jews]] were, and buried in his hometown of [[lame|Macclesfield]] which, for the record, he hated. Even in death, our [[an hero|an hero]] is denied happiness. No wonder he became [[emo|an hero]].

==The Ian Curtis/Joy Division Movie==
Recently, a movie about Ian Curtis and Joy Division was released and many critics [[fap|praised]] it. The movie, ''Control'', was intended to be a [[drama]], however, it often brought the [[lulz]] because the only thing funnier than [[epilepsy|seizures]] is watching someone have [[nice try|fake]] [[epilepsy|seizures]] for the sake of [[art]].

==Influence==
Many [[emo|current]] bands were influenced by Joy Division. However, not enough bands realized that the best way to emulate Joy Division is to have your lead singer kill him-or-herself before they start churning out shitty music.
The following bands have tried to be reminiscent of Joy Division [and have probably failed]:
*[[My Chemical Romance]] - In a February 2007 Mojo magazine column, frontman [[fag|Gerard Way]] is supposed to talk about Joy Division's music... but mostly talks about himself and [[art school]].
*Fall Out Boy - Their cover of "Love Will Tear Us Apart" made [[16-year-old girls]] cream themselves. Everyone else wanted to engage in [[cutting|self-harm]].
*Nirvana - Lead singer + suicide = people giving a shit.
*[[Prussian Blue]] - More Nazi sympathizers!
*[[U2]] - Bono has been reported to fantasize about [[buttsecks]] with Ian Curtis. This might have contributed to Curtis's [[suicide]].
*Interpol - Monotone voices unite! Only not, since Ian Curtis is dead. Fail.
*Any other band with with a member who committed suicide, inability to play their instruments, and/or sing in more than one tone.
*Also, inevitably, [[Mudkips]].
