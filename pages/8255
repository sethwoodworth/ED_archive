The Law of Conformity
[[Image:TMW_nonconformist_reduced.gif|thumb|An example of non-conformity.]][[Image:GothStan.jpg|thumb|Non-conformist goths.]]
The Law of Comformity states that the more [[teenager]]s attempt not to conform to certain stereotypes and shared identities, the more they actually do conform to other stereotypes and identities.

For example: many teenagers become [[goths]] in an attempt to stand out as individuals, or else as a means of expressing what they feel is their "true self." However, in adopting the mannerisms, attire and [[music]]al tastes of the goth community, teenage goths ultimately end up conforming to a greater degree than they would have if they'd just worn normal clothes and not drawn attention to themselves.

The fact that certain [[:category:cliques|cliques]] of "nonconformists" are actually highly intolerant of those who do not conform to their nonconformist standards is a phenomenon covered by [[the Hivemind Corollary]].

All in all, the Law of Conformity creates a fresh [[irony]] and plenty of [[lulz]] for real nonconformists (e.g. people that don't try to be non-conformists.)
