Electricity
[[Image:Laptop batteries.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Go on, you have 3 seconds. Which one is yours?]]

'''Electricity''' is that magical tingly friend that makes your lights shine bright, your [[internets]] flow, and your criminals sizzle. Its un[[lulzy]] properties are well documented [http://www.kidskonnect.com/subject-index/15-science/72-electricity.html here] in a style of writing [[Simple English|you can handle]]. Otherwise you can just watch the [[Youtube|video]] [[Electricity|here]].

== History ==

Electricity is the [[white man]]'s new slave and made it possible for the [[U.S.]] to recover after the abolition of human [[slavery]] in 1863. Some dramatic [[scientists]] who brought us electricity were:

=== Ben Franklin ===

The ''only'' historically noteworthy [[Philadelphia]]n, Benjamin Franklin was an [[epic]] [[pimp]] with four children by his wife, and countless illegitimate ones, which is how he discovered that collecting electricity in your body gives you a higher sperm count. Fortunately, few people are [[badass]] enough to survive the process, though many [http://www.metacafe.com/watch/219209/pee_on_elecric_fence/ try.]

=== Nikola Tesla ===

Nikola Tesla came up with the Tesla Coil, Teleforce, Tesla's oscillator, a couple [[UFO]] theories, renewed contemporary interest in pseudo-science, some ideas about [[New Age]] Occultism, the Tesla electric car, Tesla principle, Tesla's egg of Columbus, a few electronic circuits and patented a bunch of crap that's outdated now and didn't make much [[money]] to begin with. Concerning the questionable logic of his harebrained bestsellers Edison once said:

{{quote|Opportunity is missed by most people because it comes dressed in overalls and looks like work.|after reading "Tesla Predicts Fuelless Plane Without Engine,‚Äù New York Herald Tribune, 1927}}

...but much speculation has arisen. Thomas Edison was from [[New Jersey]], so it's doubtful he could read a newspaper targeting an audience in [[New York City]].

The only thing Tesla was involved in that really proved useful over the long haul was Alternating Current electricity. That's because [[House|Westinghouse]] and [[semen|Siemens]] had a finger in the [[pie]]. One might notice that Westinghouse and Siemens have large international companies named after them. Tesla however, has more 25 year old [[virgin]] [[fanboi]] geeks than [[Star Wars|Carrie Fischer]], who love to get [[butthurt]] over the fact that Thomas Edison invented more useful devices with a lot less [[science fiction]] potential and made a ton of money. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla The Official Shrine of Nikola Tesla] is updated every quarter-hour by said fanbois and they will revert your attempts at portraying him from a realistic perspective within seconds.

Eventually [[dying alone]] in 1943, Tesla's legacy of irritating real scientists by [[FYIAD|ignoring the laws of thermo-dynamics]] was buried by [[wikipedo]]s in the late '[[90s]], who, it is likely, will also die alone. But by far his most important contribution was giving the world the Tesla Coil as popularized in ''Red Alert 2''. This would eventually spawn a [[meme]] [[OL]]. [[Some argue]] that this is more than can be said about Franklin, who spawned corny IRL re-enactors. From an internets perspective that's entirely [[true]], but they discount the proof that Franklin had [[IRL]] [[sex]] ''at least'' 4 times. There is no proof that Tesla had sex at all.

=== Thomas Edison ===

A [[tobacco]] chewing slob from [[New Jersey]] (big surprise) who invented [[Japan|affordable versions of existing prototypes]] that made a lot of money like light bulbs and phonographic record players. He got epically butthurt when no one wanted to use his phonograph for [[Unwarranted self importance|archiving important events]] and it took him decades to come to terms with the fact that the main users of his products were [[16 year old girls]] listening to black person tunes at the local pop-shop at three songs a penny and people who wanted to see in the dark without fire. To his credit, Tesla lulzed it up big time by saying:

{{quote|As an eminent pioneer in the realm of high frequency currents... I congratulate you on the great successes of your life's work.|Nikola Tesla, getting a [[BAWWW]]! out of Edison}}

To put this into modern terms, consider how those who perfected voice recognition in the 70s must feel every time they call the unemployment agency and wish they could get through to a real person, 40 years later.

He had a lot invested in Direct Current electricity and tried to spread a bunch of propaganda against A/C but not [[for the lulz]]. 
Edison was a good friend of [[Alex Ford|Henry Ford]] and Tesla's [[Cult|early followers]] probably thought that had something to do the [[automobile]] industry's ignoring his perpetual motion theories. Tesla hated him and [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2230246117 so do his fanbois.]

== Electrocution ==

Something [[Texas]] holds very dear to its high-cholesterol heart, electrocution of undesirables for the lulz is often [[for great justice]]. High amperage creates great heat, causing flesh to burn; thus the "Texas [[BBQ]]". Whether it be in a chair or hanging from [[Limewire|live wires]], the amperage of electrical current [[Yes we can|can]] [[kill]] you at high enough levels. Despite this common knowledge, numerous people get killed trying to cross electrified railroad tracks every year, much to Darwin's relief.

== Electric Companies ==

[[Electric Boogaloo|Electric Companies]] charge on a "kilowatt hour" basis, which, unless you're a [[mathematician]], you will never be able to understand. On average, a normal [[USA|U.S. home]] has a monthly electric bill of $184. [[Washington, D.C.]] has the highest rates on average, with $0.11~ per kWh, while in contrast [[Idaho]] is $0.06 per kWh. This is [[nobody cares|irrelevant]] however, as nobody wants to live in [[Idaho]], but it is interesting to analyze the racial demographics. Electric companies have several methods at their disposal for producing electricity but the lulziest by far is Nuclear Fission, just ask [http://beccacox.deviantart.com/art/Chernobyl-Red-83948252?q=sort%3Atime+gallery%3Abeccacox&qo=1&offset=20 anyone from Pripyat.]

What do I do when the power goes out?

# Check to see if you set up the UPS.
# Curse yourself for turning off "Auto-save". 
# [[BAWWW]] about not being able to watch the newest ''[[Lost]]'' episode.
# Go into Dad's closet and get a [[Pornography|magazine]].
# Sit around and talk to people you have [[Family|no interest in talking to]].
