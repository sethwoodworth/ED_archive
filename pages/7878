Subeta
{{watched}}

'''Subeta''' is yet another rip-off of [[Neopets]] with even shittier servers that crash <s>weekly</s> twice a day. As a virtual petsite, it is a breeding ground for [[furry|furries]], [[fag|fags]], and [[16-year-old girl|16-year-old girls]]. They constantly whore out their shitty art as well as Deviantart faggotry crap. Either avoid or [[sage]]. The name of the site is Korean for "slut".

==Subeta Itself==

Every fucking page on this website is accompanied by a 'convenient' toolbar to the left displaying everything there is to be done. [[Anonymous|One]] may read the news section, play [[Crap|ultra-fun text-based browser games]] that eventually cause you to [[Divide by 0|time out]] due to SO MUCH CLICKING, run down to the main shops to buy some awesome non-Neopets-ripped-off [[Dildo|goodies]], explore the "[[AIDS|world of Subeta]]," head on to the trading center to trade your pixelated [[Plushie|plushies]] for pixelated [[food]] (just like Neop--[[Ban|B&]]), and an art gallery where you can draw shit like [[Five-penised cows|this]]! They even have an [[Otherkin|oekaki]] section! And oh lawd, a forum where you can bitch and moan about real life problems and get frozen (word "frozen" totally not ripped from Neopets, just in case you were wondering!)

Any mention of some other petsite out there qualifies as INSTANT BAN! Because of course, [[Neopets|Subeta is the only petsite to have ever existed in the history of FOREVER]]. Also, don't even think about making more than one account or let someone else play the game on the same computer as you. Two or more accounts under the same IP = INSTANT BAN! Not even a warning for you. You poor thing!
It should also be known that unlike [[Neopets|other sites that may or may not be similar,]] as opposed to "guilds," Subeta has "Cults." Healthy child's fun right here folks. 

'''Fuck. Kids, screw that shit and go [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKL_EpnSp8 read a book]. For God's sake.'''

==Staff==

[[Image:Keith.jpg|thumb|right|The owner of Subeta. Fag.]]

As with every website even remotely related to [[furry|furfags]], the moderators at Subeta are always cooking up a pot of drama to serve to their [[Basement-dweller|players]] nice and hot! First off, the owner of the site: Keith. [[AIDS]]. No doubt.

With Keith comes jerks like Chimaera (now DNA), mbif and a whole load of staff who doesn't give a crap about the users. Chimaera has been in charge of designing ALL the pets, and each pet looking crappier than the last. She ignores her user's complaints and continues to draw all of them herself. Is she trying to boost her portfolio so she can get the fuck out of Subeta and into a REAL job? Or is she just a power-hungry slut who has a fetish of drawing 300lb porn on the side? 

In conclusion. The staff at Subeta are immoral, immature, and just want a player's money. If users speak up, if users ask any questions that seem unorthodox, and if users ask them where their money goes, they will freeze their own users right away. The admins denied getting paid for so long until Anonymous uncovered their grand scheme. The admins and artists do get paid, real money, from the pockets of Subeta users, while the servers go down, while the site goes unfixed with MySQL errors all the time.

Ask questions. Go ahead, try it. Dare to ask about [[Lies of subeta|the lies of Subeta]].

==The Longcat Crusade==
[[Image:SeriousCat Subeta.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Serious_Cat|Serious Cat]] sets the record straight.]]

Subeta added a "[[longcat]]" clothing item sometime in April of 2007. The chans caught wind of this (don't ask how; apparently a certain [[anon]] is a SubetaFag), and immediately politely asked Keith to remove it. Keith responded by relaying a message in comment tags on the front page HTML (something his stupid 12-year old userbase could never figure out how to read) which was a fake message from Longcat full of [[faggotry|infantile swearing and insults]]. Bad move.

The fury of various chans was unleashed in the form of massive hacking and DDOSing, resulting in Subeta dying after barely a few hours on 4/28/07. Subeta was back up within the week but denied any such thing had happened, and that it was a "kernal error." 
[[Image:subetakilled.jpg|thumb|left|Some ballsy anon killed her pet, in the name of Longcat.]]
Keith continued to lie, and more and more Anonymous joined in the fight. Putting dry logs on the fire, Keith continually lied to his userbase, saying that the chans were evil and didn't invent Longcat. The flames only shot higher, with massive attacks, 24 hours a day, on every imaginable front. Keith's address, parents' address, phone numbers, school records, social security number, and finally credit card number were all attained easily and used in the stupidest way possible: 30 60GB Playstation 3s and ten DVD copies of the first four seasons of The Fresh Prince of [[Bel-Air]] were ordered off of his Amazon.com account, which subsequently froze his bank account. 

Anonymous set up phishing sites and grabbed many Subeta accounts. Hundreds of Subeta users' names and passwords were hacked. Many users lost their accounts not just on Subeta, but on other bastions of faggotry as well - [[Photobucket]], email, [[eBay]], [[PayPal]], [[MySpace]], [[Gaia Online]], and other important sites. How did this happen? Well, perhaps that could be covered in [[Lies of subeta|the lies of Subeta]].

Nearly a month later, after countless message board spams, DDOS attacks, stolen user accounts, Subeta moderators quitting (admitting their "lives were ruined"), and a mini-rebellion among his users, Keith still wouldn't give up a tiny picture of Longcat. This added yet another facet to the already epic battle: Lulz. We had now completely ruined hundreds of lives because Keith wouldn't give up a tiny stolen image of a cat. Anonymous did it for the lulz. And Longcat.

Finally, on May 21st, some brave Anon hacked Keith's GoDaddy account, and forwarded Subeta.org to an image of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Epic lulz. Keith wrote an apology, removed all Longcat references, and an EPIC WIN was declared. Thus, one of the most hard-fought onslaughts in chan history ended in glorious victory.

==A User Appears!==
In the beginning stages of Longcat raid, a sadly misguided [[retard|user]] contacted Keith via MSN. This user does not have the exact transcript, but the rough idea of the chat has been provided.
{{quote|User: My friends are extraordinary programmers and know how to set up a "wall" against the chans. They're willing to help you with whatever you need.

Keith: I'd rather attack their servers.|MSN chat}}

Being an [[Internet Tough Guy]] was more important than the 100,000+ morons that pay for his vacations, car, and designer bullshit. Judging from various accounts of the raid, the server Keith is referring to in the chat most likely belong to [[420chan]]. A tip for the future: you don't attack websites with boards dedicated to invading websites. Dumbass.

The user reports that any questioning of the raid, even asking what the hell happened, leads to either topic deletion or banhammer.

==Keith Busted==
Keith Kurson, the admin of Subeta.org has been caught distributing pornographic images of him and his gay buddies. [http://digg.com/offbeat_news/Keith_Kurson_of_Subeta_org_caught_distributing_gay_child_porn digg link] Also, the jewhole is now down, and will most likely not be coming back for a long time.
[[Image:subfagbaww4.png|thumb|200px|left|"because some little people have nothing better to do than bash Keith and company"]]

==Subeta goes Subetax==
On June 6th, 2007, Anonymous proceeded to hack into Keith's e-mails. They got his driver's license, personal images, online purchase receipts and his server information. Along with this, they got his Godaddy account and proceeded to raep anything they could. Anonymous deleted his domains three times. Once on May 21st (after a friendly dosing of Bel-Air), and twice again in June. Keith either gave up trying to get his domains back or Godaddy was shitpissed at him, because Keith has seemed to switch over to Subetax now. His attempts at trying to get his Godaddy account back have all failed. After having their website replaced with a picture of Bel-Air for 24 hours, Subeta finally surrendered on May 21st, and an EPIC WIN was declared.

==Oh shi-==
As of 7/25, its back. It's believed, however, that it won't last long, as financial ruin is surely right around the corner after pwning Keith for so long.

[[Image:subetafagbaww2.png|thumb|right|Some Subeta newfag gets mindraped by the glory of ED]]


And now a days the tard Keith continues to run the site 'efficiently'. By apologizing to the users of Subeta in the News section, stating when and why he and the other staff, will make the site go down for 'A few minutes'. All of the users of Subeta are mindless followers who gladly ''Thank'' Keith when he tells them that he will shut down the site for a couple of hours. 

Subeta has so many problems with it's main data base that they actually experienced a draw-back in the system, meaning that everything every single user had done in the past two days on the site, was deleted, or 'never really happened' Keith of course, got on and adorned every user with cash credits. And what do you know, the little fuckers gladly accepted the gift, and went back to their regular tardness.

==Round 2?==
Despite Keef being the center of one of the most epic wars the chans have fought, it would seem he isn't quite through.  Just like the lovable bloody beast at the top of this page with the [[desu]] eyes.  But the stupidest thing they could quite possibly have done was, a few months after the epic win and Keef's half-assed apology, a new challenger approached: a pet called "Sage" who can also be "Field Sage" if green in color.  Are they referencing a [[pedo|wise old man]] or dare they tread upon the sacred [[sage]] that is the bases of chan faux-democratic votes of contempt?  Does it even matter?  A thread on /i/ called this to the attentions of [[Anonymous]] who are waiting till after the epic [[9/11]] raids to figure out what to do.

==Subeta fucks up again==
[[Image: SubetafaghatesED.png|thumb|left|Some emo Subetafag bawwwwing about ED.]]
As of April 19th 2008, some old subeta users who called themselves Artificial and KaosKinesis got bored and decided to place cookie grabbers on some of the staff's profiles.
Keith posted on the news saying change your passwords, enderfucks bitch wife [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Centipede_filled_vagina shikoneko] followed up with don't change your passwords, and the idiots scrambled around in chaos for a few hours. It failed to be as epic as the chan raids, and the site was only in truly in chaos for about 3 hours, tops.
Some of its [http://subetadrama.org/board/index.php?topic=1257.0 fansites have hilarious boards 'bout it.]


== Subeta fucks up a third time ==
[[Image:shikoender.jpg|thumb|right|The Adventures of Ender]]
[[Image:Fuckingkeith.PNG|thumb|right|Subeta.ws before Keith managed to move the site there. YAY NEWS AND IMAGE UPLOAD SITE. WHAT A GOOD REPLACEMENT.]]
On July 11th, 2008, about 3pm, Keith posts on his [http://pownce.com/subeta/notes/2744795/ Pownce] begging Subetards to PLZ PLZ GO TO [http://www.subeta.ws NEW SUBETA] PLZ DON'T GO TO SUBETA.ORG 
Subetards everywhere question WTF is going on, and have seizures all over the Pownce, resulting in [[at least 100]] comments.<br>
According to a post Keith made on [http://neocolours.me.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=8170&st=0&sk=t&sd=a Neocolours], enderfuck and his bitch wife [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Centipede_filled_vagina shikoneko] have been shit-motherfucking-canned and LOL HAXXORZ'D Subeta. They [[Ban|b&]] the forums and bahleeted all news posts the admins made about leaving .org and going to .ws, and pulled epic wallhax all over the place. <br>

Nobody believed Keith, so he had to rely on his [http://youtube.com/watch?v=pARQtrtHHbQ Jewtube] to GET TEH MESSAGE OUT, while simultaneously answering no questions.<br>

Last known numbers show that 200 Subetards are still on the LOL HAX'D site and Keith has still not answered any questions or given any hard explanation.

On July 12th, 2008, Keef edited [http://www.subeta.ws New Subeta Homepage] to say that enderfuck and shikoneko are "holding www.subeta.org hostage".<br>

While [http://www.subeta.ws New Subeta] is finally up, half the users are baaaawwwing that their accounts don't work and they can't sign in. Even though it was moved to the new domain, people can't actually use it. Bravo.

July 13th, the ws. site is down again. Plus, lulz:

[[Image:KeithStuff.jpg|thumb|left|Stalker Info! For all you Keith Fans.]]
{{quote|You've heard the rumor that Mr. Kurson is no longer in charge of Subeta.org. That rumor is currently true. Other rumors have been flying around -- some started by Mr. Kurson, some started by others in his circle. Some have a ring of truth to them, some do not. This post will hopefully clear some things up and give you a more "whole" picture that you may judge for yourself what has happened.

The two ex-staff members in question are indeed, currently keeping the website, subeta.org on and functioning. This is not to steal anything, as the rumor goes 'round. As a matter of plain fact, the Cash Shop paypal address still goes directly to Mr. Kurson's PayPal account. Mr. Kurson made posts, sent emails, created news, etc. to move to subeta.org before said staff members were notified of their termination. it would more appear that Mr. Kurson abandoned subeta.org and did it in such a way as to create as much backlash and drama for the ex-staff members as possible while creating a pocket of sympathy and protectors and defenders for himself.

The site stolen? Hardly. Abandoned? Yes.

Then there is the question as to why said staff members are now ex staff members. Rumors range from they were holding Mr. Kurson and Subeta.org hostage to them stealing subeta.org. The reasons are hardly as dramatic as this. Mr. Kurson terminated the two ex-staff because he felt strongly that they no longer fit in with his plans for Subeta and could not match the growth rate of it. The two ex-staff did not object to or even fight against his reasons, whether they agreed or not. If that was the way that Mr. Kurson felt, then that was the way it was. All that the ex staff members wanted was what was owed to them by Subeta.
What could Subeta possibly owe two ex-staff members? For the duration of their employment, they loaned a considerable sum of money monthly out to help offset the operating costs of running Subeta, always being promised to be reimbursed when profits picked up. Well, within the first year, profits picked up over 50%. Instead of taking the opportunity to not only begin reimbursing themselves, they decided that the money should go into paying the staff better -- to increase their practically non-existant payments to some with a bit more to it, something that wouldn't be as laughable and exploitative as they were, previously and to purchase hardware to help further increase users and, as such, profits. In a campaign to do so that lasted several months of them fighting for the staff, eventually changes started being made. While staff payments are still low for what they should be, the increases and bonuses facilitated by the ex-staff were welcomed by all, even those who opposed the ex-staff. All of this, instead of getting reimbursed. They continued to assist in covering operating costs -- this time also with the promise of stock. So while the two ex-staff did not and do not wish to fight their termination, with the actions of Mr. Kurson who has told them outright that he is not only not going to pay them what monies they have invested into Subeta, but also the monies for the time they worked for the past two weeks and their severance pay and the other contractually obligated payments he is required to pay to them, coupled with his premature accusations of them "stealing" the site, they find themselves custodians of Subeta.org.

All they can do at this point is continue to keep the site alive and secure until a peaceable resolution can be found that will make all parties happy. Thus far, all attempts to come to one have been met with silence and//or demands that are impossible to meet at this time, as they are being held hostage, themselves by the need to have the loans repaid to them and being told in no uncertain terms that they won't be.

So this is Subeta.org. Your accounts and your items here will be kept safe and secure. There can be no guarantees of what will happen to your accounts at subeta.org so if you choose to continue here, we urge you to change your passwords here and elsewhere on the internet as a security measure. You will be updated as often as updates are to be had.|"SubetaTeam" at Subeta.org}}


{{quote|Wow!
Well, this has been an interesting day or two, no? Apparently the "owners" over at Subeta.org feel that if they put their hands over their eyes, things will just go away. They can take away all of the social aspects of the site, and users won't notice that things aren't right.
They're wrong, and don't give users enough credit. The entire time they've been with Subeta, one thing that has been shown over and over is they're lack of understanding in loyalty. They didn't understand how loyal the users would be to me in this situation, and they didn't think that certain staff members would be loyal after all that has happened.
More than anything, they don't understand the trust users have in me, and how long it takes to earn that. I have nothing but your best interests, and that of Subeta, when I think of what to do next. While this is my living, and it's my job, it also means the difference to more than a thousand people daily. They come here before they do other things, they talk to their friends on Subeta, they dress up their avatar, they battle with their pets (sort of o_o). The only way those two over at Subeta.org see users is as giant dollar signs, that can be replaced right when one goes away.
That's why I know, even if it'll be hard to pay the bills this month, or if we have to take out a business loan to pay those bills, you will still be behind me, and the real Subeta. I hope that you don't feel like I treat you like paper bills, that are only here to pad my bank account - because you aren't (or I'd be driving the corvette I want !). You are all very, very important and special to me.
Now, right now there are a lot of problems with this situation. While the dictators over at Subeta.org have the domain, that is all they have. We have the staff members, the artists, the writers, the user admins, and the users. We have the community.
They are trying to hold out and create a hostage situation (ie: extortion. Highly illegal ) in hopes that I'll crumble to all of their (insane) demands.
I hope that you understand that all of this was for the best of Subeta, and for us to more forward.|Keith - at Subeta.ws}}



== CPVR: Declaring War on Subeta ==

[[Last Thursday]], a [[faggot]] named Carlos, also known as CPVR of [http://www.virtualpetlist.com/forum/index.php VirtualPetsList] posts a [http://www.virtualpetlist.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1478 thread] depending on [[Subeta/Lies_of_Subeta|out of date information]], [http://wikibeta.mbif.net/index.php/Subeta:_Behind_the_Scenes fake interviews], and [[twitter]], challenging the current administrators on how the staff are being payed.  He also has this obsession with his [http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200907/1248635062.html press release] over [[Nobody cares|catching some cyber hacker]], and spamming the fuck out of people on his [http://twitter.com/cpvr twitter].
