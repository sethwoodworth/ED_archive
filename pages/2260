'''Digimon''' was created by [[AZN]] [[pirates]] flooding the [[oriental]] toy market with an affordable [[Tamagotchi]] rip-off (which is illegal because it doesn't have enough Chinese lead in it). After going on a bender, they used their monies to fund Digimon themed mangas, animes, videogames, toys, cards, and other assorted crap that lost them all their money. Unfortunately, the Digimon anime series continues to flourish to this very day thanks to the [[faggots|"DigiFans"]] who compulsively add the prefix "digi" or the suffix "mon" to every noun and verb in their minuscule vocabulary.
 
==The Anime==
===Series 1: Digimon Adventure===
[[Image:Digimon lesb.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emo|Angstmon]] is totally afraid of his own [[Angst|Angst]].]]
[[Image:Digimondylexic.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quality]]]]
[[Image:Kari_tub.jpg|thumb|Come on, there's nothing wrong in this picture!]]

Digimon Adventure stars [[over 9000]] main characters, each more [[emo]] than the last. The main premise of the series is monsters fucking each other while the starring human of that episode cries about how their parents [[almost raped]] them. Each episode is about a main characters pointless back story until they run out of main characters, then they split up the characters or rejoin them or defeat one of the super evil bad guys ([[old meme|over 9,000]] of them too) and then back to revolving through each character crying about masturbating to his little sister.

This series was a favorite for [[pedophilia|pedos]] who fell in love with Kari. Also a favorite among deviants are the pink cowboy [[lolicon|girl]] and the delusion that two of the main characters have a totally gay thing for each other. I myself have never watched the show, nor do I know anything about it (as you can see by my statement calling Matt and Tai the two main characters), which gives me plenty of license to write an article on it HAHAHAHAHAHA DISREGARD THAT STATEMENT I SUCK COCKS.

===Series 2: Digimon Adventure 02===
02 (pronounced "zero two" by [[Gaia Online|jackoffs]]) is about another group of kids doing the exact same shit as the kids in Adventure except [[Michael Jackson|they get to go home from the digital world whenever they want]]. This series also retains the characters from the previous series who are now older. The older characters no longer exhibit preteen angst but instead teen angst. The pink cowboy girl inexplicably turned into a pink Euro-raver, then into a 70's cop show extra. All the pedo fans stopped watching Digimon after Kari became an old hag in this series, they were attempted to be replaced by gay-pedos but they didn't find Cody attractive.

===Series 3: Digimon [[loser|Tamers]]===
[[Image:Digimonjesus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jesus]] makes a cameo in the 3rd season]]
[[Image:Renamon.jpg|thumb|left|The creation of a furry icon]]
[[Image:Digimon god.jpg|thumb|right|Digimon are notorious [[Atheists]]]]

[[Image:ImpmonGun.png|thumb|right|[[Jawsus|Impmon]] [[Pretty Cool Guy|isn't afraid of anything]], especially [[niggers]]]]

The best series of Digimon and subsequently the one when everyone stopped watching because change and plotlines and character depth is SCARY. In this series, everyone's seriously fucked up. Not that [[Fursecution|baaaaaaaaw]] [[emo]] furry shit. Proper fucked up.

The story revolves around three kids who get Digimon to prevent them from going on murderous rampages. They proceed to go on murderous rampages. Digimons spawn in the real world and the Tamer'd Digimons get horny whenever it happens. Half way through the series, the main character list explodes to like 20 or something as the writers scramble to gain back an audience dwindling down to only [[Furry|furries]]. The writers find that killing off characters with tearful goodbyes raises ratings, so they do it more often. Eventually, they kill off Leomon, super number-one gay furry icon. The furry audience immediately leaves in protest, and the show loses all audience.

At this point, the writers decide to just do whatever the fuck they want for the rest of the 30 episodes. So, they put in things like mental and emotional abuse from a puppet, [[incest|fratricide]], weird sexual metaphors, and child abuse. Lots and lots of child abuse. One of the girl characters literally spends the second half of the series being fucked over by her puppet. And did we mention the fifty foot purple phallus covered with little green mouths that likes to say "You will be [[rape|deleted]]" in the voice of a little girl?

The story by Chiaki J. Konaka, [[fact|also writer of Serial Experiments: Lain]], is superb... So superb, that the only remnant of this series is Renamon being a furry icon, and even [[lie|Non-furries]] fap to her.

Also what makes this different is somehow the writers introduced them using cards Which take the HALF OF THE FUCKING SHOW to use one useless move that the bad guys usually stop.

===Series 4: [[Disney]]mon Frontier===
[[Image:digimonrapedissatisfaction.jpg|thumb|right|Hypocrites.]]
[[Image:Digimonrapeizumi.jpg|thumb|right|[[rape|And great it is.]]]]

In this series, the concept that made the previous three seasons watchable was done away with. Instead, [[shit nobody cares about|a gaggle of stereotypical characters is stuffed into living trains and has to save the digital world.]] The gimmick of this series being that the humans don't have digimon sidekicks, they simply turn into their [[fursona]] and do the fighting themselves. Made by furries for furries. Contrary to that fact, Frontier actually has the least amount of furry porn based around it, as painful, eye-bleedingly remorseless research has shown.

===Series 5: Digimon Savers===
Essentially Digimon Tamers with all depth stripped away. The [[japanophiles]] are lapping it up.  The plot involves youngsters working for the Digimon version of the [[MONGO|Men in Black]], complete with memory-erasing sticks. The average [[13-year-old boy]] is, of course, the best candidate for such an important [[Cryptokids|government security position]]. The humans and their Digimon [[life partner|partners]] team up to fight progressively harder foes, until they defeat [[God]] [[computer|itself]], just [[for the lulz]]. <s> There are no plans to release the show in English... </s> It has been announced this show is coming to [[Disney|Jetix]]. This series also has an intelligent, albeit bitchy, version of Misa from ''[[Death Note]]'', one that is actually useful, an internet survey states that 99.99% of viewers believe that Thomas should have put it in her, the other 0.01% wanted [[bestiality|Gaomon]] to stick it in her.


===Series 6: [[Shit nobody cares about|Digimon Xros Wars]]===

Recently just [[Baby Fuck|started]]. So far, the [[Shit nobody cares about|characters who can be given a crumb of fuck]] about include a [[Lolicon|girl]] named Akari Hinomoto, and [[Gangbang|two boys]], [[Verbose Thread|namely]] [[Shotacon|Taiki Kudou and Zenjiro Tsurugi]]. [[The Game|Also]], two other characters, [[Mary Sue|Nene Amano]] and [[Nazi|Kiriha Aonuma]]. The Digimon include [[Raptor Jesus|Shoutmon]], [[Centipede filled vagina|Ballistamon]], and [[Shit nobody cares about|moar.]] Basically, a [[China|ripoff]] of 4chan that which will kill the franchise again.

===Digimon: The Movie===
Just like any anime that is popular in [[America]], Digimon also got itself a movie. However, unlike the rest of the series, this is actually [[Bullshit|one of the best]] [[anime]] movies ever made. This is anime, though, so the bar of quality is set extremely low. The animation, voicing, scripting, humor, action, and conclusion are [[Gay|top-notch]]... at least, for the first two parts of the movie. After that, it just starts to suck [[penis]] and contract [[AIDS]]. Fox Kids decided two parts was just too short, three parts was just too long - but adding a horrifically mangled, chopped up and totally nonsensical 40 minutes at the end was [[Babyfuck|awwwwwwright]].

However, the real reason anyone reading this should watch it immediately is because the movie involves [[W|nuclear missiles]], computer hacking, nerdrage, and, finally, saving the [[Internet]]. Yes, [[4chan|/b/tards]], your dreams have come true. We have finally found a good movie where the main plot involves our heroes SAVING THE FUCKING INTERNET.

The heroes also happen to save the internet, not with the power of love, or courage, or friendship, or any of that stupid stereotypical children's bullshit, but with something that many of you probably have lying around the house: [[Spam|FUCKLOADS OF EMAIL.]] No, srsly.

Also, the main villain is [[anonymous|a complete asshole who at first appears to be one dude but turns out to be an entire legion of dudes.]] This shit is uncanny.

==Characters==
Note: A major source of butthurt for digifags is to refer to a character by their [[christianity|English name]]s. By doing that, fangirls can't come up with [[retard|clever]] Japanese portmanteaus for character pairings in slashfics. For the sake of neutrality, we here at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] will use the English names instead.

*[[Hentai|Tai]]: [[13 year old boy]] with [[asspies]] who looks like a [[kingdom hearts]] reject.
*[[Dyke|Sora]]: [[Ginger]] bitch who is all [[emo]] because her mom's boyfriends keep raping her.
*[[Emo|Matt]]: Emofag later turned [[ska]]fag.
*[[Nerd|Izzy]]: Underage gay porn star... or so millions of fangirls would have you believe.
*[[Whore|Mimi]]: Lesbian lover of Sora who all the men rape when she's sleeping.
*[[Faggot|Joe]]: Nerdy faggot who faps to [[harem anime]]s.
*[[Baby|T.K.]]: Matt's younger brother AND son!
*[[Bukkake|Kari]]: [[Mary sue]] who cuts herself when their digimon are forced to fight the evil villain. She couldn't be on the series earlier because she got [[aids]] and got [[pregnant]] and had a miscarriage because she was so ill. [[fact|She gave TK a blowjob after episode 13]].
*[[Pedophile|Davis]]: Same thing as Tai, except he wants to fuck Kari! No... wait, that's still the same.
*[[Virgin|Yolei]]: Nerdy [[Cock Trapper]] who has the hots for Davis, even going so far as to kidnap him and lick his asshole.
*[[Homo|Cody]]: lol his dad was killed in a black person related shootout.
*[[Slut|Jun]]: Davis's sister who wants to suck on Matt's cock and eat TK's for breakfast.
*[[Nazi|Ken]]: Male mary sue who contracted [[AIDS]] after a [[fact|threesome with Davis and Kari]].
*[[Faggot|Takato]]: Obsesses over the digmon [[otaku|annie may, trading cards, video gaymes and action figures]] - lol fourth wall! Real digimon believers regard him as their savior because he finally got his own digimon! Too bad those faggots fail to realize he, too, was a cartoon character.
*[[Sad|Rika]]: Her [[slut|mom]] doesn't pay attention to her so she murders boys for being chauvinists ([[moar]] [[liek]] jewvinist, [[amirite]]?) and then dines on their severed penises. She pimps her digimon out to furrychan for drug money.
*[[Chink|Henry]]: Goes around bombing Japanese embassies for invading [[china|his country]]. When he asked the Japanese why they did it, they responded "for the lulz."
*[[Douche|Takuya]]: The creators were running out of ideas so they thought, "What would Tai and Matt's homosexual offspring look like?" Thus, Takuya was born.
*[[Wigger|Koji]]: A wigger who wants to become Japan's next [[Gackt]].
*[[Your mom|Zoe]]: Some feminist chick whose existence is never elaborated on.
*[[obese|JP]]: [[you|Fat fucker]] who wants to rape Zoe.
*[[Shota|Tommy]]: More [[shota]] material!
*Jew: Koji's lover, who is more emo than Koji, but less gay than he is
*[[Dumbass|Thomas]]: Rapes Marcus on a regular basis, and [[pedophile|goes out on dates with Marcus's little sister]]. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_EAWsJWYHI YA RLY]
*[[Retard|Marcus]]: [[Jesus|The son of God]] (LOL Spoiler) who goes around [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrHdXHdVJ8w punching] and enslaving Digimon because they're furries. Only one smart enough to know goggles make you look retarded, although he covers his hands in orange glitter.
*[[Yoshi-lord|Yoshi]]: An Italian dinosaur, or something.
*[[Bastard|Keenan]]: Raised by furries and [[emo|hates himself]].
*[[Bitch|Sarah]]: Stupid bitch who mothered Marcus that isn't smart enough to realize 14 year old boys should not be [[atheist|going against the will of God]].
*[[Skank|Kristy]]: Simply there so lolis can find this season watchable.

==The Mangas==
[[Image:OKAYzip.gif|thumb|Tai preparing to tame the vagina.]]

Digimon has 4 manga series...
*V-Tamer: about taming [[vagina|vageene]]
*Digimon Next: about a Digimon Soda factory
*Digimon Chronicle: a continuation of Digimon Next where the main character starts a [[Fox News|Media Outlet for mass propagandaz]]
*D-Cyber: about furry cybering
You won't be able to read any of these though as a search for any will undoubtedly lead you to gay or furry or [[redundant|gay-furry]] [[slash fiction]].

==The Games==
There are 16 Digimon video games spanning every popular genre; from rpg to racing to fighting to adventure to [[hentai|H]]. All of them suck though. <s>All of them.</s> Except for digimon world 3, which is thematically similar to the movie. Being the only good digimon game, it is of course nearly impossible to find at a reasonable price. It is also [[Plagiarism|a lot like]] [[Dot_HACK_Sign|dot HACK,]] which is odd, because it came out five years before that cyberpunk crapfest.

Most of the RPG games have you traveling around a landscape very unlike Pokemon with your Digimon [[gay|life partner]] and playing cards with people. I think it was poker, and you'd get your thumbs broken if you didn't pay up after losing a game.

==Digimon vs Pokemon==
[[Image:Superior!.JPG|thumb|[[srsly]]]]

Source of much drama between furry sub-groups. Pokefags say, "Digimon is just a ripoff of Pokemon", Digifags say, "NUH UHH, HOLY SHIT DIGIMON WAS RELEASED IN 1991 GUYZ! Digimon was created first!", [[Nobody gives a shit|which may or may not be true]]. The truth of the matter is Pokemon is originally a ripoff of Monster Rancher and Digimon is originally a ripoff of [[Pocky|Tamagotchi]] and both have anime series for the sole reason that all the [[Japanese]] do all day is make animes, games and [[Rule 34|porn of everything in existence]]. Not that anyone with a life really gives a shit. Though we all know that [[Yu-Gi-Oh]] is the real serious business. However, in fanfaggotry wars Pokemon wins due to its creations of [[Gardevoir]] and [[Mudkip]]z.

[[Image:Can'tunderstand.jpg|thumb|right|"I can't understand anything at all!" says Takato about the theories]]

Some people are [[fantard|such big fans of Digimon]], and so very, very, [[lonely]], that they pretend that they have their own imaginary Digimon companion, and are [[Otakukin|Digimon Tamers]] [[unfunny|(moar like lusers, amirite)]]?. You might not think it is so unusual for someone to have an imaginary friend they can pretend will [[kill it with fire|breathe fire]] on all the [[E-Bully|bullies]] at [[school]], as [[you|everyone]] has done this in the past. However, the group, <strike>[http://groups.msn.com/RealDigimonBelievers '''Real Digimon Believers''']</strike> [[Deleted | BALEETED]], takes it one step further.  Instead of just [[buy a dog|buying a dog]], they have deluded themselves into thinking that they have real Digimon pets, and, like a [[Scientology|freaky cult]], will try to convince all nonbelievers to share their delusions.

The Real Digimon Believers are seriously trying to find a connection to the [[Heaven|Digital World]] where they will reunite with their long-lost Digimon companions. These plans, dubbed <strike>[http://digiclipse.digi-pop.net/ '''Project Digiclipse''']</strike> [[Deleted | GONE]], the only completely logical and scientific way to reach the Digital World, involve toy Digivices, their parents' [[computer]]s, [[suicide|plastic bags]], and waiting for a passing [[UFO|comet]]. This is the link to the new faggotmon are real website.[http://grou.ps/digimonarerealredux]

What. The. Fuck.

=== [[France|Qu'est que c'est]] "Project Digiclipse"? ===
According to the <strike>[http://digiclipse.digi-pop.net/about Project Digiclipse website]</strike>, "Project digiclipse is the combination of hope, belief, and the theories of members of all digimon [''[[sic]]''] believers. The point is, '''we believe that digimon''' [''imaginary digital monsters featured in the program''] '''exist''', and '''we are determined to find a way to bring them to us'''. The way we attempt to do this, is simple, yet hopefully effective. We gather all the belivers [''sic''] that we can find, and focus on our goal at the exact same moment all around the world, hold our digivices to the sky, and the laws of mind over matter [''sic''] tell us that we can achieve our goal; a digital portal opening somewhere nearby."

That's right. These people believe that the universe and inhabitants from the TV cartoon series ''Digimon'' are ''physically real'', and that a "portal" can be opened to this universe if a group of "believers" all hold up their toy Digivices [''licensed products based upon the show''] at the same time and wish ''really hard''. As the website explains, "They [''the Digivices''] may be toys, but many of them are a symbolic or even spiritual connection to our [[homosexuality|partners]], and act as a bridge between our world and the digital world by sheer love and belief. That's what this entire project was based on, the power of the mind, and our connections, if not just our belief. It's been proved throughout history that if you believe in something, it can happen... As long as you believe, something is bound to happen!" Yes, and for the Digiclipsian, that "something" could well be the arrival of burly mental health nurses, called upon by their terrified parents to drag them off for a two-month vacation at Camp Haldol.

However, lest we write of the believers in the Digiclipse as the modern-day version of the [http://www.apologeticsindex.org/m10.html Millerites], the author of the project webpage sounds a note of realism amid the hope for a digital [[Rapture]]: "We can't tell you whether or not it will work," the website admits, "as it has not been attempted by anyone before. This is sort of a hopeful experiment, but even if a portal doesn't open, it will bring us all closer and hopefully weaken the barrier between the worlds." Sounds like a long shot. Besides, as Scotty of TV's ''[[Star Trek]]'' once said, "Any decent brand of Scotch'll do that, Sir."

=== Le potential pour les «lulz» ===
The website has a forum for believers, with typical topics such as "what will you do if when do you wake up see your partner???" and "Matter...and... Data? ...Just how can I become Data?" The [[lulz]] potential is high [approximately 720 milli[[Jameth]]/kb as measured by lulzometer (1 Jameth = 1,000 mJ = guaranteed corruption of [[lol]])]. Any of the standard [[drama-generating techniques]] could be used to generate epic amounts of [[butthurt]] among the spastic retards that populate the message boards. [[Rule 34]]-based techniques should be especially effective, as most of the members seem to be at the (physical or mental) age where [[sex]] is the overt or covert motivator behind every obsession. It's a target-rich environment; try a shotgun approach and see what happens.

=== PROOF ===
The Real Digimon Believers can unequivocally prove that Digimon are indeed real through [[Photoshop|poor photo manipulation]] and [[MS Paint]].

{{morphquote|digimang|background-color: white; width: 80%; height: 200px;|font-weight: bold;
|We do lots of [[fapping|research]] sometimes, and [[bullshit|usually come across things]]. Also, we have a few [[Mike Sandy|learning programmers]] in the group who seem to know a lot about Digimon and data and things. Sometimes we hear noises and see things, but we usually only associate them with Digimon when it has our toy Digivices involved. It maybe sound immature, but there's no saying that data can't travel through the air to the device(right?), or that invisible creatures aren't controlling it. |'''RulerHD''' - Leader of the Real Digimon Believers
|Of course, it can be disputed, but the fact of the matter is, the existence of Digimon is plausable, and very much probable. Though it hasn't been proved, there are [[otherkin|loyal fan bases]] out there that have evolved their belief into something more; a seperate community of "believers". Most will ban anyone who joins and lurks, or just to simply troll. There have been a lot of attempts made by the fakers to mislead the groups, though it is always obvious who is lying, and who is not. The leaders of such groups are [[retarded|skilled]] enough to tell a true believer from a [[troll|troublemaker]], so to save you time it isn't recommended for a "non-believer" to join.
These groups have proved that not only is Digimon an [[pr0n|innocent childrens show]], but it is the base of a [[pedophiles|thriving community]], and has made many people [[grammar nazi|friendsaround the world]]. Most aare children, and therefore [[lies|do not have any kind of furry activity]], or [[hentai|hentai imgages]] <s>and it is definate that it will stay that way in the future.</s>|'''[[User talk:Crushedupwax|RulerHD sockpuppet]]''', a self-proclaimed member of [[idiots|THe RDB Revenge Squad]].

[[Image:Digimon OWNED.JPG|thumb|right]]

===Digifag site owned===
The [http://digiclipse.theiforum.com/ original Digiclipse fourms] got owned during a raid by the g00ns and anonymous. Srsly guyz, Digimon is not real.

The Digifags made [http://s1.zetaboards.com/DFT/index/ a new forums site] [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Truth (NEW SITE!)] , but it can only be seen by registered users. They are [[butthurt]] from the previous attack and therefore require new members to create an account and then fill in a survey to prove their intentions are not malicious. Clearly, there is not a single troll on the internet cunning enough to getting past such solid defenses, so now their crazy little forum is [[lulz|completely safe]].

[[PROTIP]]: You merely need to register to see (and [[screenshot]]) the forums. The survey is only required for those interested in [[trolling|posting]].

The digifag admins are known to browse various chans and even ED - don't do what the fag below did and ruin perfectly good lulz by telling everyone too early.


[http://s1.zetaboards.com/DFT/topic/3899962/1/ They also Are interested In Incest]

===Reraided LOLWUT?===
On July 1st 2008, they were rehit by a troll calling himself DigiPwn. Slandering the site with racial slurs and incestuous threads, the discovery was made that even if the threads are deleted, the titles stay up to be seen.

Posting that discovery here led to that problem being fixed less than four hours later. Thanks ED, or more accurately, thanks [[User:Animorphs18]], you've done the digifags a great favor, even if it only delayed the inevitable.

===Rereraided/Reloaded?===
At about 3 AM, on the 10th of July, an old fashion [[troll]] who went under cover for at [[At_least_100|least 100 years]], [[Drama|fucked up]] the beloved site for the [[lulz]] by clearing out the FTP and having it replaced by a well drawn [[So_cash|comic]]. This brave [[troll]] did so with the help of her trusty [[cats]], [[fags|TweedleDee and TweedleDum]].

The [[troll]] mentioned in her letter that the site would most likely be back up in [[at least 100 years|a matter of hours]] - which it is now apparent it will be. Like any good [[lulz]] observer, archives have been made. Screen shots of the site before and after (including the [[furry|site admin's]] [[butthurt]] message to the troll) can be seen here:

*[http://i36.tinypic.com/2z3vtom.jpg The comic, in which digifags learn a new word.]
*[http://i38.tinypic.com/2lngswz.png The page source, including notes from the trolls.]
*[http://i37.tinypic.com/aky0t4.jpg The note from TK.]

(Someone took the time to screen this shit? Wtf?)

Also, there are no women on the internet, unless the bitches have started trolling from the kitchen. This means you, [[O rly|Aurelie (Yarelie?)]]. But who really cares? Everyone knows [[O rly|Aurelie (Yarelie!)]] did this for [[lulz]] and for glory on teh internets since she feels [[self-esteem|insecure]] about the sand in her vagoo. (This is the truth. I know because I personally have it imported weekly from the beaches of Bermuda and shovel it in by the truckload. And by [[penis|vagina]], of course I am referencing my [[goatse|gaping asshole.]] ~[[O rly|Allie Yarly Aurelly Yarelly]]) Lulz abound!

The digifags report that while they are indeed [[butthurt]] over [[O rly|Au-Relly Ya-Relly]]'s actions, they acknowledge that she did a good job being a troll. They also know how to use [[shit|Encyclopedia Dramatica]] effectively and understand that [[slavery|free speech]] for all = lulz, as well as the capacity to [[Hillary Clinton|laugh at oneself]]. Lulz lolz lulzzipop.

==Digimon Fantards Spend Millions on Merchandise==
Equally as sad as believing that Digimon exist, there are some "believers" and [http://mimi18hotty.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=digimon&offset=48#/d2xtprk Holy Grail of Collectors] that will spend their entire life savings on a franchise. Many young adult fans claim that this [[obsession|hobby]] makes them happy by [[Olchai|keeping their childhood alive]], allows them to feel closer to the [[cartoon|digimon]], and that it keeps them from throwing themselves head first into the nearest parked car. [[fantard|Digimon fantards]] are most often between the ages of 15-26. Those over the age of 14 are most often diagnosed with [[Delusions|chronic Digi-Delusions]]. Sadly, the only cure is [[Suicide|logging out]]. 

'''Levels of Digi-Delusion'''
*''' Exposure:''' As a young child (9-12) the brain is susceptible to Japan's [[Brainwashing|Advanced Brainwash Satellite]]. 90% of the earth at any given time is exposed to it's radiation. 42% of the world's children population is affected. Exposure to [[furries]] can initiate this same process.

* '''Development:''' Nearing the ages of 13-14, the subjects begin listening to J-pop, spend their whole paychecks on ebay buying Digimon cards, and could possibly [[Bestiality|have sex with their family dog]]. Shockingly, the males face rejection, as they fail to understand why no sane girl in High School would fuck a nerd who faps to Renamon on lunch breaks. This is also the point when they begin to read manga and  watch subbed anime, which eventually leads to them developing [[Aspierations|aspirations]] of [[Unrealistic Expectations|becoming a professional mangaka or a Japanese translator]]. 

* '''Digimon Believer/Tamer:''' Their [[delusion]] becomes so intense that [[Schizophrenia|the boundaries of fiction and reality no longer exist]]. This commonly begins around the ages of 14-19. The brain becomes so saturated with thoughts of [[fail]] that it can no longer handle it, and the process of differentiation between realities critically shuts down. The Subject may possibly start carrying a [[Plastic Crap|toy digivice]], praying to digimon gods, or [[Animal Abuse|painting the house cat]] to resemble [http://dma.wtw-x.net/dexgato.shtml#page=page-1 Tailmon]. Shouting "Digi Port Open!" at a computer screen in a desperate attempt to escape reality is also not an uncommon symptom.

* '''Digimon Devotee/[[An Hero|(Final Step)]]:''' Usually people who progress to this stage are 20+ years old, Their mind is nothing more than a blank screen, with Digimon theme songs playing in a loop. They never leave their homes, out of fear that society will never accept them, and have resorted to playing the digimon card game against themselves; because their friends fear catching "Digi-Delusion". As time progresses the Devotee soon realizes he or she has wasted their life (and money) and begins thoughts of [[suicide]]. More Often than not, the Digitard eventually runs out of money. Stricken with desperation he/she then takes their pitiful life, in hopes that their soul will go to [Heaven|Digital World].

==[[Shipping]]==
[[Image:Taiisgay.jpg|thumb|right|Tai, after reading this section]]

Digimon, while a complete rip-off off [[Pokemon]], has had its moments where it produces [[lulz]]. The most visible example is during the second season epilogue where many fans where [[Butthurt|dismayed]] that their [[ship]] did not win at the end. [[Science|Scientist]] have proven that many fans where so upset that many became [[an hero]] after it was shown. Need proof? Why do you think the popularity diminished after that season? When interviewed, [[Troll|Hiroyuki Kakudou]], the director for the first and second season, said, and I quote, "[[I did it for the lulz]]." When asked about the number of [[an hero|an hero's]] he said he "[[Shit nobody cares about|didn't care]]."

===Taiora===
The pairing between [[13-year-old boy|Tai]] and [[Ginger|Sora]]. Perhaps the most [[lulz|lulzy]] of the ships due to how popular it was (and still is), many were [[butthurt]] when Sora chose [[Nazi|Matt]] over Tai. After Matt and Sora ended up married at the end, the fans for this ship were in denial that they [[TL;DR|wrote letters demanding canon be changed]].

Common fans for this ship include: [[emo|emos]], [[nerd|nerds]], [[you]], [[lie|jocks]], and [[16-year-old girls]].

===Mimato===
If Taiora is the [[lulz|lulziest]] of the lot, then Mimato is definitely its retarded cousin. This refers to the relationship between [[Nazi|Matt]] and [[Wapanese|Mimi]]. While many of the other ships can be [[lie|somewhat defended]], this one was thought up after some [[16-year-old girl]] thought they "looked so cute" even though they don't acknowledge each other's existence. [http://community.livejournal.com/yamatoxmimi/9860.html The funny part is that many of them actually believe that there was actual evidence, making them the most retarded of the bunch]. They are the best target to troll against, as they can be trolled by anyone who has seen the show even if the volume was turned off. [http://www.fanfiction.net/forum/Mimato_Mansion/10516/ Troll at your own free will!] Many were also [[butthurt]] at the end, and insist that [[Ginger|Sora]] was a [[slut]] who stole [[Nazi|Matt]] from [[Wapanese|Mimi]]. They are that retarded.

Common fans for this ship include: [[emo|emos]], [[nerd|nerds]], [[you]], [[retard|retards]], and [[16-year-old girls]].

===Takari===
[[Image:Don't show to Takari fans.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Don't ever show Takari fans this picture, especially [http://www.vgfuture.com/host/hopelight/forum/ here] or [http://www.fanfiction.net/forum/Digimon_02_The_Clash_of_Love/2306/ here].]]

Pairing between [[Fag|T.K.]] and [[Mary Sue|Kari]]. [[TL;DR|Long story short]], the most butthurt of the lot after their ship was not canon at the end. Out of all the shippers out there, they are the most in denial, as well as producing the most [[an hero|an heros]]. Because their holy matrimony did not bloom at the end they say there was an interview that said their couple was canon, but when asked to produce said interview they change the subject. They also say [[lie|they've seen the original]] and say shit like "[http://www.tv.com/users/Digifraek/profile.php Takeru says there that it has been 25 years and he married Hikari]" regardless of what the [[truth]] is. It should also be noted that, since many have shipped this since the first season, all fans of this ship are [[lolicon|fucking lolis]] and should be reported to the [[FBI]].

Common fans for this ship include: [[emo|emos]], [[nerd|nerds]], [[you]], [[retard|retards]], [[christians]], and [[16-year-old girls]].

===[[fag|Taito]]===
Gay shit thought up by [[16-year-old girls]], with many claiming it was close to being canon. If somebody says they didn't see it, fans for this ship will start claiming [[homophobia]]. Ironically, many fans for this ship are [[woman|girls]] and tend to hate all the other females because they might interfere with the [[In the ass|butt sex]].

Common fans for this ship include: [[emo|emos]], [[nerd|nerds]], [[you]], [[retard|retards]], [[liberals]], and [[16-year-old girls]].

===Kenyako===
A romantic relationship between [[Rape|Ken]] and [[Bitch|Yolei]], and surprise, surprise, [[shit nobody cares about|this one was actually canon]].

Common fans for this ship include: [[emo|emos]], [[nerd|nerds]], [[you]], [[geeks]], and [[16-year-old girls]].

===Sorato===
The pairing of Matt and Sora, canon to the show. Also known as... '''MATTRAEG''' due to the male viewers analog character, Tai, being [[cock block|cockblocked]] by Matt, an analog for every boy more popular and talented than the viewer. Basically...

Hey Faggots,

My name is Yamato "Matt" Ishida, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day looking at a scaled-down version of the Digital World. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever had a Digimon that can kill a Dark Master in one-hit? I mean, I guess it's fun making fun of people because of your own insecurities, but you all take it to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on Aerisdies.

Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much perfect. I was in an extremely popular rock band, and my Digimon can Digivolve to Mega. What can your Digimon do, other than "sit around all day in its own Digi-filth?" I'm also an astronaut who was the first person on Mars, and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just blew me; [[so cash|Shit was SO proDigious]]). You are all faggots who should just kill yourselves. Thanks for listening.

===Daikari===
Spelled Dakari by [http://www.fanfiction.net/u/990976/ fucking retards], this is the relationship between [[wigger|Davis]] and [[Mary Sue|Kari]]. Usually attacked by [[Christians|Takari fans]], they have been known to turn a perfectly [[happy]]-go-lucky character into a [[Emo|wrist slashing, angst-filled]] pussy who listens to [[Linkin Park]]. Many people who ship this due so because they've [[hitler|been rejected more times than an art student]] in the [[real world]].

Common fans for this ship include: [[emo|emos]] and [[your mom]].

===Daiken===
More gay shit, but this time involving [[wigger|Davis]] and [[Rape|Ken]]. Usually written by [[shotacon]] fan girls, many of these stories involve [[rape]]. Because of this, one can and should assume that girls writing this pairing are [[asking for it]]. Shippers for this couple hate [[Bitch|Yolei]] and [[Mary Sue|Kari]]; no exceptions. [http://community.livejournal.com/ship_manifesto/129276.html Since they condone rape], it's okay to rape them, not that anyone actually would.

Common fans for this ship include: everyone mentioned above. Yes, even [[christians]].

===Daikeru===
Even more gay shit, surprisingly. Since this relationship involves [[Fag|T.K.]] and [[wigger|Davis]], most of these stories will be a retelling of [[WW2]], what with the [[White people|the white guy]] dominating some [[japanese]] guy. Expect whitey to come out on top (lol).

Common fans for this ship include: [[emo|emos]], [[nerd|nerds]], [[you]], [[liberals]], [[lesbians]] and [[16-year-old girls]].

===Michi===
Relationship between [[13-year-old boy|Tai]] and [[Wapanese|Mimi]]. For those who've been dumped and are smart enough to realize they are not going to get any, this is the coupling of choice. Since this is written by rejects, expect only songfics by [[Linkin Park]] and [[My Chemical Romance]].

Common fans for this ship include: [[emo|emos]], [[nerd|nerds]], [[you]], [[losers]], and [[16-year-old girls]].
