'''Kawaii Kitsune''' or '''[[KKK|KK]]-the-Fox''' is a [[Sonic|sonicfag]] [[DeviantART|tartlet]] and a former member of [[shit nobody cares about|The Tails Realm Retard Cult]]. Her main hobby is [[Sonic the Hedgehog|stealing Sega characters]] and recoloring their fur in MSPaint, then she builds war zones <i>against</i> art theft. Lulz, what a fucking hypocrite. When she's angry at her [[lonely|lack of boyfriend]] she floats her fat ass down to ED and pretends like this article is a fucking compliment. She's also completely addicted to pink (not the Victoria's Secret underwear brand, that kicks ass), the color pink, like a six year old who forgot to grow a fucking brain. If you troll her AIM she'll call you a stalker; apparently she's unaware that everything you need to stalk her is on her devianTART page. 

==Personal Life==
[[image:Gayerthangay.jpg|thumb|left|Kawaii Kitsune before the sex change.]]

On July 12, 1992, KK-the-Fox was shat out of her mother's [[vagoo]] after a failed abortion; this explains why she claims to be "immortal." At least we can't blame her mother for not trying. Born with both a penis and a vagina, KK-the-Fox was raised until the age of fifty as a man named Kevin, but she got a sex change after she met a guy named [[Axl Darkix|Axl]] while at a [[yugioh|Yu-Gay-hoe]]! Tournament. She plays Yu-Gay-Hoe! because her real life is boring, uneventful, and full of [[fail|massive failure]]. Let's face it, she's never leaving the basement, this is the only way she'll ever be able to meet other losers like herself. She also lost her internet virginity while cybering with her favorite cartoon character Tails, because she knows nobody in real life will ever touch her floppy, frothing vagoo. When she's not having cyber-sex with [[fat|fat-ass]] Sonic fans, she enjoys playing shitty games like "Sonic Riders" on [[Playstation 2|the most fail-tastic video game console ever]]. She also took a sewing course to create a life-sized Axl darkix furry [[plushie]] to stick his felt dick up her ass. She also claims to love drawing on her "tablet pc," which explains why her art sucks. Tablet PCs make terrible drawing surfaces-- but honestly speaking, it looks like she draws with her foot. She is also quite fond of shiny things, like a [[retard]].

[[Image:Kkthefox heart axl.png|thumb|It's still unknown if her boyfriend Axl is imaginary or just stupid. Either way it's pathetic]]
KK-the-Fox's Mom is also a big, fat, [http://z6.invisionfree.com/The_Tails_Realm/index.php?showtopic=1581&hl= meanie-beanie-fo-feanie!] Seemingly unaware that her Mom is actually trying to help her develop normal social skills, she bans everything KK-the-Fox likes "for no reason." According to KK-the-Fox, [[Pokemon]] was first banned, then [[Digimon]], then [[Neopets]], and as of February 6, 2006, Sonic too received the motherly ban-hammer. As lulzy as this is, KK-the-Fox is a [[fat|rebel]] and isn't going to be put down by any authority figure. 

She has absolutely nothing to do with her time. She fills out every stupid little profile thing she can get her chubby hands on; and she has at least one post in every single thread in that [[The Tails Realm|Tails Realm Retard Cult]] thing (8.2 posts per day so far).  She recently left after a dumb argument with Galenar the retard.  Now she's back with more lulz.

In response to this article KK said that her mother is actually more about [[Goofy_Time|child abuse]] than doing what is right for her children (though a good beating is probably all KK really needs), and regularly beats her and her brother and sister. It's also likely that KK's mother puts ants in her retard son's [[hugbox]]. What KK didn't explain is why such a hateful mother would buy her a tablet pc, or allow her to spend copious amounts of time on the [[internet|interweb]] doing nothing.

Officially on September 29, 2007, KK broke up with her imaginary boyfriend, Axl. KK's psychologist indicated that Axl was an imaginary 19 year old pedophile that liked to commit statutory rape with 15 year olds. KK's parents did not approve the imaginary rape romance, so KK was forced to take some medication to make Axl disappear. As a side effect of the medication, KK's gaping monstrous vagoo sizzled up into a dry onion.

==Her [[Mary Sue]] Fursona==
All this shit was dug up [http://z6.invisionfree.com/The_Tails_Realm/index.php?showtopic=1911&hl= here.] Note that it's boring as shit, and you probably don't wanna read it, unless you're going on a trolling spree.

*<b>Personality:</b> [[bullshit|KK is an adventurous fox who's often hyper and enjoys being with her friends. She's always willing to make a friend, listen to her friends when they need someone to talk to, and she'll help them in any way possible. She'll defend her friends no matter what, even if it means putting her life on the line. She enjoys going on adventures and just about anything exciting and fun, especially when she's with her friends. She can't remember a thing about her past, and the only things she remembered when she woke up after a blow to the head was her nickname, birthday, and only a little about her powers, and she usually wonders about it and how she got hit in the head in the first place.]]

*<b>Her Unknown Past:</b> [[shit nobody cares about|KK was living happily with her family in a thriving and beautiful village when one day, when she was 5, her mom passed away. Her father who was one of the village's guardians was training KK to be a guardian when she came of age. (The guardian of love and friendship, to be a bit more precise.) One day when she was 12, her father was killed defending the village against an army of Eggman's robots and she was sent to live with her aunt, who wasn't exactly nice to her. KK continued her training for another year with another guardian, a friend of her father. She completed her training soon after turning 13, and one day decided to leave the village, to find adventure... and get away from her crabby aunt. She was nearly out of the village when another robot army invaded. The other guardians immidiately started to fight them, but the robots were very strong and neither side made any progress in destroying the other. Meanwhile, many of the other residents were panicking as the robots continued to rampage. KK knew she had to help and started to run back to help when one of the robots running past hit her in the head and she lay unconcious next to one villager's home. The next day she woke up in a village now in ruins, barely able to remember anything. KK vowed to someday figure out what her mysterious past contained and what had happened to the place where she awoke.]]

==Shit FanFiction==
Like every true retard, KK-the-Fox writes [[fanfiction|fan fiction]]. Unlike most writers, she is completely incapable of writing a single paragraph of text, so it consists almost entirely of dialog, with maybe a brief sentence fragment detailing the setting. Also, nearly every bit of dialog contains a fucking emoticon. She may be fifteen years old, but she writes like someone half her age. 

 Excerpt from "[http://z6.invisionfree.com/The_Tails_Realm/index.php?showtopic=1417&hl= American Idiot-I Mean Idol]"

 <b>Sonic:</b> ^__^ Let's try out for American Idol!!!!!!!!
 <b>Amy:</b> O.o Why?
 <b>Sonic:</b> ^__^ Cause it's cool.
 <b>Eggman:</b> <i>*pops out of nowhere*</i> YEAH!
 <b>Sonic:</b> O_O <i>*hands everyone a gas mask*</i> Caution, everyone! You never know when Eggbutt's farts will
 strike!
 <b>Eggman:</b> COME ON! They're not THAT bad! <i>*farts*</i> Oops...
 <b>Sonic:</b> QUICK EVERYONE! PUT ON THE GAS MASKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 <b>All but Knuckles and Eggman:</b> <i>*do that*</i>
 <b>Knuckles:</b> But it's just a- <i>*smells air*</i> OH MY GOSH!!!!! <i>*faints*</i> X_x

 <b>Knuckles:</b> O_O GET OUT OF HERE, EGGBUTT!!!!!!!!!
 <b>Sonic:</b> YEAH! <i>*kicks Eggman through the wall*</i>

It.. it just goes on like that with no end in sight. What's that? You say you want some more of this absolutely shitty fan fiction? Well try this load of crap on for size!

 Excerpt from "[http://z6.invisionfree.com/The_Tails_Realm/index.php?showtopic=1366&hl= The Crazy Adventures of Sonic and Co.]"

 <i>*soon they are all on a hike*</i>
 <b>Rouge:</b> T_T I hate camping..................*<i>kicks a rock, but it's really a beehive*</i> O_________O
 <b>Bees:</b> -_-* ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ <i>*chase Rouge*</i>
 <b>Rouge:</b> O_____________O AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Seriously, that's how she typed it word for word.

==Pain in the Ass==
[[image:Kkediting.JPG|thumb|Kawaii Kitsune is very funny]]
It is KK-the-Fox's duty to rise against ED and eradicate the ED article on The Tails Realm. Due to her rabid fanboyism, and obsessively snorting Craft E-Z Mac cheese powder, she stays up all night refreshing The Tails Realm page making sure no new additions have been made; if a new addition has been made, you can be sure she'll do what she does best--bitch about it. Any editing to her quote causes her to continue her internet [[liberal]] raid and further displays her immense anti-social behavior. She'll try and debunk this by saying she has a bunch of friends on DeviantArt which actually translates to having no real friends at all.

==Dumbass Animations==
KK and her fans all believe that she is a prodigy when it comes to animation. Her animations usually consist of faces that blink and smile every twenty seconds. That's right. THEY. ALL. FUCKING. BLINK. Sometimes she mixes it up a bit and makes the animation wink rather than just blink, just to keep her fans on the edge of their seats for what her next exciting animation will be. Most reasonable people who realize that her animations are made up simply of compressed homosexual erotic novels theorize that her animations were made while she feasted upon her own cock. Another group theorizes that she bashes her head against a wall several times and then attempts to create animations while in a coma.

==Thoughts==
We have reason to believe this sums up everything that transpires in Kawaii Kitsune's mind.

==The Butthurt==
[[image:Bye_by_KK_the_Fox.png|thumb|right|Kawaii Kitsune's declaration of BAAAAAAWWW with more pink. =D]]

Finally on the 13th of September 2007. Kawaii Kitsune became painfully aware of how [[lonely|no one actually liked her]]. She felt unappreciated and left the [[internets]] 4EVAR. Out of the 6,602,224,175 people on the face of the [[Earth]], approximately 3 people gave a fuck; sources also suggest that one of them was [[attention whore|faking it for pageviews]].
The final straw appeared to be internal [[internet drama|drama]] when another Deviant by the name of [http://galener.deviantart.com/ Galener] made fun of her in a comic. So she [[crybaby|cried]], bitched, threatened to [[delete fucking everything]] (as if anyone gave a flying condensed piece of shit in the first place), and quite in a lulzy torrent of [[fail]].

{{quote|I've had enough, and I'm saying what I feel. I'm done crying. Still hurt, but no more crying.|Kawaii Kitsune}}
Before she left, she took a moment to post a reply comic that did nothing besides enshrine her [[fail]] in pink and white for all eternity. Leaving one of her 3 remaining [[Retard|fans]] to go and whine and vigorously masturbate to the color pink for her in her stead.

And, like most who claim they're leaving, Kawaii Kitsune is back and acting like none of it ever happened.
