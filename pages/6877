They say that the porn industry is a leader in technological innovation. A bold and perverse tribute to this statement is the '''Realdoll''', a [[plastic crap|corpse-like android]] invented purely to give [[you|grubby shut-ins]] some late-nite company. Although there is only one company that manufactures the actual Realdoll, the term encompasses all realistic sex-dolls. For a [[bullshit|modest]] price, [[you]] can receive a life-long companion that looks like it was just scooped from a casket and exudes an alluring musky fragrance of [[fart|outgassing]] latex.

== Anatomy of a Realdoll ==

Realdolls have steel skeletons and silicon skin, much as biological humans do. While they are similar in height to the average woman, they are usually equipped with [[tits]] as [[BBW|big as watermelons]] or [[loli|as small as mosquito bites]]. The weights of the dolls also border on the extremes; the [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Anna Nicole Smith]] models are among the most popular. [[Feminists]] claim that the manufacturers of the dolls are guilty of perpetuating unrealistic views of the female body, but [[truth|nobody listens to feminists]].

== Features and Accessories ==

Some Realdoll owners just need to have that extra patch of [[Shitting Dick Nipples|pubic hair]] for their robot lover. Manufacturers of the glorified [[fleshlight]] have taken note of this and offer to customize dolls for a sizable fee. Although Realdolls can be purchased for [[fucking|only]] [[expensive|$6,500]] without any additional accessories, extra customizations can bring the price to $10,000 or higher. Sadly, the dolls come without an internal heater for the time being, which means that the Realdolls feel as corpse-like as they look. [[TOW]] suggests that people heat their Realdolls with electric blankets or hot baths. Prospective doll buyers should take this advice; [[dying alone|Wikipedia editors are probably well-versed on these matters]]. Another accessory that has yet to be developed is a voice-box. If you purchase a Realdoll, you'll find that it can't yet whisper [[netspeak|sweet nothings]] into your ear. However, [[not|real]] [[you|men]] don't care about this, as they know that women shouldn't be allowed to speak anyway. Rumor has it that sex doll manufacturers are developing a female doll with [[multiple personality disorder|multiple selectable personalities]], including one that [[raep|doesn't consent to sex]]. News of this caused a massive shitstorm within the [[moralfag]] community that continues to rage on today. Of course, the [[porn|porn industry]] always wins wars of morality, and soon [[creepy|you]] will be able to buy your very own rape victim!

== Falling in Love ==

Similar to pillow-humping dogs, some Realdoll owners can't tell the difference between real women and their inanimate companions and thus fall in love with their Realdolls. This confusion may be due to the fact that these [[lonely]], pasty creatures haven't had much contact with actual females. Oblivious to the fact that loving something that can't cook, clean, or bear children is [[pointless]], Realdoll lovers romance their silicone babes as only [[desperate]] men can. Forums, documentaries, and [[old media|television specials]] document this bizarre phenomenon and often make the amateurs' mistake of giving the [[freak|doll-lovers]] a 'human' dimension. The people who [[molest|love]] these dolls out of desperation either have [[unrealistic expectations|ridiculously high standards]] or are unaware of the fact that actual, living [[Land Whale|fat chicks]] will date even the most troll-like of basement-dwellers as long as they receive enough attention. Regardless of the motives behind treating a Realdoll like a wife, lovers of the dolls die with nothing but polyester mannequins and [[kittens|cats]] to keep them company.
