'''Sollog''' is a world-renowned [[psychic]] who famously predicted [[9/11]], the [[London]] bombings, the collapse of Enron, and [[Linux|GNU/Linux]].

He started his own religion, the '''Temple of Hayah''', which claims that the [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] have got it wrong for the past few thousand years and God's name is actually "Hayah". Those who disagree with this theory are known as Hayah-haters and are advised to still love god even if they disagree with the teachings of Sollog. This gave rise to the phrase "hate The Name, not the Hayah".

Followers are expected to be "obedient to the 10 Commandments in the Torah and no other laws of man or God," which means they can go around [[Ohbutyouwillpet|raping children]] so long as they remember to be good to their own parents.

[[Wikipedia]] has been on a [[racist]] offensive against Sollog and his prophecies ever since he revealed the sordid history of [[Jimbo Wales]]. Mentions of his prophecies have been viciously reverted, and his slave-name, "John Ennis", substituted in place of his God-given name.

==[[BRBFBI]]==

Sollog has had numerous brushes with the law for a diverse array of crimes.  It is worth noting that 100 years ago society wouldn't put up with shit like this and any constant trouble maker who claimed to be God would have been burned at the stake.  Who says progress is always for the best?    

Sollog was [[FBI|party van'd]] in 1996 for making death threats to the President Of The United States of [[USA|America]] - luckily for him the Pres at the time was [[Bill Clinton]] who was too [[drugs|stoned]] to care about nutjobs, unlike his [[W|successor]] who would probably have had Sollog incarcerated at the Guantanamo Retirement Camp For Thought Criminals and Sand Niggers.  So no charges were bought against him.

But the Secret Service did find that Sollog, or Johnathon Patrick Ellis, as he is known to law enforcement officers, had two outstanding warrants against him.

The first one was from 1987 when he was put on Probation in Maricopa County, Arizona for [[Jailbait|selling obscene materials]] - a charge to which he admitted, despite constantly claiming ever since that he has never had any involvement with pornography ('''''[[PROTIP]]:''''' Google and Whois starting with his company name Adoni Publishing and check out the network of sites that fall under the Adoni banner.  Hmm - not ''much'' [[porn]] there).  While on probation he committed an aggravated assault and fled Arizona, the state promptly issued a warrant for him.

And in February 1988 he was arrested for fleeing the scene of an accident that he caused while driving drunk - apparently he managed to hit the same car twice and then took off at 100 miles an hour pursued by officer Sam D'Urso.

Officer D'Urso alleged that when he finally pulled Sollog over the great prophet then reversed into him and dragged him down the road under his car.  

Unfortunately for Officer D'Urso when he sued the rental company who provided Sollog with the vehicle used in the accident, he claimed that he was in the opposite lane to the one stated by the Prosecution and that his injuries were caused by God driving into him from behind.

Sollog's prosecution would have used this conflict in official stories, and the fact that D'urso lied in order to make $100,000 in an out of court settlement, to have the charges against Sollog dropped.  So of course Sollog fired his defense lawyer and presented himself.

In a four day hearing that came to be known as the God Trial, Sollog - who claimed he was God for the duration of the trial - made prophesies and religious rantings.  He accused D'Urso, the Judge, the Jury and his former prosecution lawyer of being involved in a conspiracy to restrict his free movement across the planet he had created.  The judge who by most accounts was red in the face for the entire four days, continually upheld objections that the Prosecution had not made in an effort to get Sollog to STFU.  The Jury found him guilty on all four of the charges against him and he was sentenced to Buttsecks with Bubba.

He then tried to get the court to wait half an hour while his wife went to get him some sneakers, telling the judge that; "I have high arches, your honour, and ''the last time'' I was in prison my feet were killing me".

==Trolling==

Sollog is a great [[trolling]] tool.  On IRC, one must only adopt Sollog's name and go into a random channel on Freenode and start spouting prophecy.  The unwashed, unbelieving masses quickly react in disgust, anger, and fear.

Please note that it is impossible to join '''#wikipedia''' with a Sollog-related nick unless it is seriously munged.  The following [[lulz]] occurs if you fail:

11:25 < Blackrobe> Sollog predicted that Interdictor would become this popular
11:25 < colonelPyat_> Sollog also uses a method whereby cities in the United States are linked by imaginary lines, claiming a successfully predicted disaster for any hurricane which passes over these lines. For example, in 2002, he predicted that 17 particular hurricanes would hit 17 particular cities [7]. However, over half of these hurricanes had already passed without destroying any cities, and the names will not be reused until 2010 at the earliest. H
11:25 < colonelPyat_> urricane Katrina was notably absent from the list.
