Knol
[[Image:Knoll.jpg|thumb|Google's latest invention, a [[weed|grass]]y ''knoll'', as harmless as it may look, is about to [[pwn]] Wikipedia for the [[lulz]].]]
[[Image:New-google-logo-thumb.jpg|thumb|Lawl, Google likes [[Boobpedia]] too! Excellent choice of model, too. And do I look like I fucking care if you know who my favorite [[porn]] actresses are? No, I don't, because I'm not a [[pedophile]]. If you've got nothing to [[bomb|hide]], there's [[lie|no reason whatsoever to oppose mass surveillance]]!]]
'''Knol''', aka ''knulz''/''nullz'', is the latest liberal propaganda machine of the U.S. of [[goatse|A-hole]]s, and, like that other wiki, a quackery and ignorance machine. It is run by the CIA via its puppet, [[The Google]]. It seeks to outpropagandize the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Indeed, Google have bravely ventured into the world of the [[university|academic]] beyond [[shit nobody cares about|Google Scholar]], and have set up their own new [[encyclopedia]], one which [[some argue]] will be the [[death]] of [[Wikipedia]] once and for all. This made the pseudo-intellectuals at the [[Wikipedia Review]] get their [[panties]] in a [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=19406 collective twist] with joy and [[pleasure]] as something that presents a real and genuine threat to TOW is a big thing indeed.

Despite the [[drama]], there are a number of significant differences between Knol and Wikipedia. This may mean that it turns out to be something that [[Y2K|got everyone worked up and turned out to be nothing at all]]; but on the flip-side, it may mean that the [[Wikipedia admins]] are left finally [[pwnt]], [[LaraLove|weak and powerless]] once and for all. A certain Wikipedia Review member recently described the situation this way - by encouraging links from Google to Wikipedia so that Wikipedia [[fat|grows larger]], Google is "fattening the [[sceptre|pig]] up for slaughter", as it is currently thought that there is nothing to stop Knol users passing off any and all [[GFDL]]-licensed content from Wikipedia as their own work - and not only that, they can make [[money]] [[epic win|from it]]!

==Policy and the Basic Ideas==
Knol requires that the editor use their [[real name]] whilst writing an [[article]]. This means that Knol is definitely [[serious business]], and allows for better treatment of [[Deceased Wikipedians|experts]] on certain subjects, who do not need to deal with [[sockpuppet]]s and [[edit war]]s over certain controversial issues that the [[Arbitration Committee]] at Wikipedia always ends up taking action on, because these experts will pretty much [[Wikipedia:WP:OWN|own]] their articles. This is because Knol will allow [[at least 100]] articles on the same subject, like [[Adolf Hitler]] or the [[United States]], each with its own [[POV]] slant. Want to push a POV? No problem, just head down to Knol! Just don't expect anyone to choose [[you]]r article though, because it is [[shit]]. Providing your douchebaggery IS copypasta worthy, it will be ripped off no matter what, so you can ignore the whole Creative Commons Cuntbag 3.0 Elite licensing which is nothing more than a snob tag to attach to your POV.  (It is also not known how Knol will tackle such issues as [[notability]], [[BLP]] and the [[criteria for speedy deletion]], but that's another story).

In that sense, Knol looks on the surface to be like a glorified [[Citizendium]] or [[Wikinfo]], allowing [[original research]] as much as the author likes, making it possibly even less accurate than Wikipedia! Daniel Brandt will still not be satisfied with Knol of course, as he can see through the [[bullshit]] of Google's "don't be [[Josef Fritzl|evil]]" policy, because ironically Brandt is concerned with the data logging carried out by Google despite the fact that he collects huge amounts of [[dox|personal information]] himself.

[[Apparently]], you can rate and review Knols and add comments, unlike Wikipedia who maintain a strict, [[anal]] talk page policy that goes something like "'''THIS IS NOT A FORUM FOR GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE ARTICLE'S SUBJECT'''", because any edits made unnecessarily means that [[Jimbo]] has less money for choosing the finest quality [[hooker]]s in every city he travels to for business meetings and [[Wikimania]], whilst expecting to be greeted like the [[Pope]] in every city he visits. This means it is rather like [[Wikia]] in that sense, and tolerates more cruft than Wikipedia itself.

Most importantly however, Knol can earn [[you]] some juicy, delicious [[cash]]. That's right, your [[article]] could be making you [[money]] if you sell your soul and your [[dox]] to Google, through the ad revenue generated by the [[13-year-old boy|end-user]] who ends up looking at the piece of [[crap|trash]] you have written. Since doing things like [[recent changes patrol]] or being a [[Wikipedia admin]] should in any [[sane]] person's mind require payment anyway, this Knol is the death Knell for Wikipedia, and not only that it won't require any of the bullshit associated with the moderation at Wikipedia because it'll be a lot more crisp, clean, professional and [[mature]].

==Knulzy quackery==
After only a few weeks, the knulz were already being infested by quackery and useless knulledge. Examples:

*andreas-kemper/diskriminierung
*andreas-kemper/sexismus
*randall-paulsen/the-relationship-between-mindfulness
