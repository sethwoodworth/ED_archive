A '''Christian''' is a special kind of zealous [[Yahweh]] [[fanboy]] or [[fangirl]]. Christians are unique in that they have a [[sexual]] obsession with a Jew who lived roughly 2000 years ago named [[Jesus Christ]]. They are well known for rejecting [[science]] in all its forms and [[ironically]], themselves serve as [[proof]] that there is no [[intelligent design]]. They believe there is a vast [[secular]] conspiracy to exterminate their ilk by ''not'' forcing kids to pray to their deity and [http://www.cbn.com/CBNnews/115829.aspx taking the word "God" off of coins]. [[DO IT|The next logical step would be to feed them all to lions]]. They will accuse [[you|YOU]] of hating Jesus. [[why do you hate America?|Why do you hate Jesus?]]

Christ [[fandom]] is one of the oldest, with a history that spans continents and centuries. To suggest to a [[fundamentalist]] ([[hardcore]]) Christian that the [[Bible]] is poorly-written fiction will probably result in you being [[pwnd|burnt at the stake]]. Christians, like [[furries]], are often very defensive about their degeneracy.

The most important day of the year for Christians is Easter, when, as legend would have it, Jesus Christ burst forth from a giant chocolate egg to save you from your [[sins]]. The second most important day of the year is [[Christmas]], where Jesus gained 200 pounds in a matter of days (à la Tim Allen in [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111070/ that shitty movie]) and then murdered the first born sons of all the heathens Moses-style. 

Christians follow a religion that was created by the [[Jews]] to serve Jewish purposes. Basically, the Jews convinced half of the world to worship their evil tribal god YHWH, and even to worship a [[schizophrenia|batshit crazy]] kike named Jesus as "God in human form". Subconsciously this affects Christians in a severe way, causing them to associate the Jews closely with God, which has allowed the Jews, always a clever lot, to control societies for ages.

Something you may not know: [[Duh|The vast majority of Christians are in fact homosexuals in denial.]]
 
== [[History]] ==
[[Image:Lion eating cross2.jpg|thumb|Christians were [[lion]] fodder in ancient [[rome|Rome]].]]
[[Image:NaziPriests.jpg|thumb|Christian ideology has not changed much throughout [[history]]]]

According to the [[Bible]], [[At least 100|at least 100 years ago]], Jesus of Nazareth<sup>[[✡]]</sup> was born in [[Israel]] to an [[irony|unmarried]] Arab couple: a carpenter and a [[Jailbait|14-year-old girl]] whom God paid ten cents to love Him longtime. Jesus was born in a barn, surrounded by [[Furrys|animals]] because his parents were [[poor]] as shit. He was an asshole growing up, running away from his parents to [[rape|heal]] [[Disease|lepers]] and drink [[wine]] in temples with [[hobos]]. Jesus is known to have made up some crazy shit and told everyone that [[Schizophrenia|God told him to say it]]. But of course, we now know that it was just all the acid.

When he was older, lots of people liked him and invited him to their parties because he could ([[allegedly]]) turn water into wine and make bread and [[pussy|fish]] appear out of nowhere. He also ([[allegedly]]) made people [[Micheal Jackson|come back from the dead]] and ruined everyone's fun by healing [[aspie]]s and everyone else that had [[mental disorders]] and made them [[Anonymous|normal members of society.]]

Eventually, people got pissed off at him for ruining their fun and using shitty box wine. Seeing the opportunity, [[Neoconservative|Karl Rove]] advised Pontius Pilate on how to [[murder]] Jesus and become the leader of Israel, which at that point was owned by Rome. Eventually, in 33 C.E. Jesus was [[For the lulz|nailed to a cross]], even though he came back to life three days later. [[Jews]] were just as power/money-hungry in 33 C.E. as they are now, so they told everyone that Jesus died for his followers and anyone who did everything "Jesus" said could go to heaven. They also made up stories and told people Jesus said them, then they wrote them in 66 different books that collectively make up [[Lies|'''The <big>Holy</big> Bible''']]. Jesus's [[Fanboys|devoted followers]] actually believed this shit, and thus, Christianity was born.

[[Image:Oldtyme.jpg|thumb|right|This is what happens when Christianity is left in the hands of amateurs.]]

Christian mythology revolves around a [[Mary Sue|Gary Stu]] by the name of Jesus. Jesus was a [[Jewish]] carpenter who was born from a [[16-year-old girl]], who got [[Impregnated|knocked up]] after she was [[raped]] by an angel. After failing in his first job as a carpenter, Jesus became a magician, developed a huge fetish for [[BDSM]], and became [[an hero]] for your sins. 

As if this isn't ridiculous enough, Christians also believe that you must pray every day to his [[Zombie|undead corpse]] to remove the [[evil]] from your soul that was put there by an all-[[loving]] God because a rib-[[woman]] ate an apple offered to her by a talking snake who was actually [[Satan]]. [[Seriously]].

Christians will only argue about Christianity if [[you]] agree to four preconditions:

# All information in the Bible is [[true]]. <s>No exceptions.</s> Except when it's metaphors 
# Jesus eats your [[sins]] so that you can go to [[Heaven|Skyland]].
# There is one God and He is real (and [[male]]). No exceptions.
''...therefore'', Christianity is the one and only [[Truth]]. QED.

and remember, there is also a list of guidelines to attacking the book of Revelation:

# If any [[bullshit|strange occurrence]] listed in that book happened in any order remotely close to that  written in Revelation, [[goatse|Jesus]]! the prophecy is being fulfilled, REJOICE!
# If you are arguing that an occurrence directly contradicted this book of divine vision, you must be reading it out of context.
# If you can prove that you're speaking in the proper context, and Revelation is still being contradicted, it must be in GOD'S CONTEXT.
# If the point is made multiple times outside of the context it is written in for that particular phrase, it must be a parable.
# YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO QUESTION GOD'S WORD ANYWAY. All questions will be answered when the Hale-Bopp comet arrives, and [[an_hero|takes us to the level above human]].

Disclaimer: Most Christians probably couldn't read that anyway, as the KJV of the bible is beyond most of their vocabularies. See the watered down holy book in layman's terms here.[http://www.christianity.about.com/od/faqhelpdesk/p/newinternationa.htm The Holy Bible: TL;DR]

==Christians and [[Sex]]==
[[File:Altar Boyz.jpg|300px|thumb|left|This is what happens as a result of their experiences!]]
[[Image:Emochristfag.png|thumb|right|Why so [[emo]]?]]

Unlike [[Buddhism|certain other religions]], Christianity isn't big on giving you prescriptions ([[DO IT|what you can or should do]]). Rather, Christianity is all about the <u>pro</u>scriptions (what you can't do under penalty of God-delivered [[lightning bolt]]) to the genitals. Leastwise one good thing can come out of fucking a Christian girl. They are more likely to have anal sex since they cannot have Vaginal sex until they are married. It's not [[gay]] if [[Shota|he's under 13]]... right?

'''Following the tenets of Christianity can't have [[sex]] with:'''

# Anyone outside of marriage.
# [[Bestiality|Animals]]. Which means [[furries]] can't be Christians. Even religion has its upsides.
# [[Homosexuals|People of your own gender]].
# [[Incest|Members of your own family]]. (Unless you are Lot's daughters and have booze Genesis 19: 30-39)
# A woman who is on her [[period]].
# ...or even [[Masturbation|your own hand]].

Funny thing is, [[pedophilia]] is never mentioned in the Bible as a form of sexual immorality. So Catholic priests touching altar boys is [[BABY FUCK|awwwright]] (according to 3000 year old anachronistic scripture written by drunkards hallucinating).

Given these brutal restrictions, it is no surprise that sex scandals are common among the Christian aristocracy. The type of scandal varies by denomination:

* '''Protestants:''' Leave their wives to run off with [[Jailbait|teenage]] [[sluts]].
* '''Evangelicals/Fundamentalists/[[Neoconservatives]]:''' Caught in gay sex scandals, despite being rampant [[homophobes]]. ''Example: [[Ted Haggard]], busted for hiring and smoking meth with ([[Lie|but supposedly not having sex with]]) gay prostitutes.''

== The Bible ==

The [[Shit nobody cares about|Bible]] is a [[boring]] space opera where God, a [[bipolar]] [[Xenu|intergalactic tyrant]], fucked everyone over who ever thought of crossing him in an effort to show them who wore the pants. 

Despite his repeated [[ruination]] of mankind, he eventually grew tired of killing off nearly all of the population of which he created  and forcing them to incestuously reproduce because he's such a nice guy. He does, however, hate fags. Just ask his favorite man[[slave]], [[Fred Phelps]].

All Christians are [[hardcore]] fans of the [[Bible]] and will literally stab you in the face if you do not immediately embrace their exact view of [[God]]. This exact view [[hypocrisy|conveniently]] ignores Jesus' explicit prohibitions against self defense and divorce while embracing imaginary prohibitions against [[drug|drugs]]. They reject basic [[evolution|scientific facts]] due to skepticism, yet in a stunning twist, they believe fucking [[bullshit|everything]] written in any book labeled "The Bible", regardless of how unbelievable it is.

== The Bible: Special Edition 2-disc Set ==

[[Image:Bible non.jpg|thumb|/b/ on Christianity.]]

Most Christians are split between the [[canon]] original (aka Old Testament) and the fanfic (aka New Testament) and there is much debate as to which version is best. Clearly, you can trust [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] to give you advice on such matters.

===[[Oldfag|Old Testament]]===

[[File:Communist-Christianity.png|thumb|[[Bullshit|Christianity: Freedom, Peace and Equality for everyone.]]]]

Starting from the beginning of all life as we know it, we learn of [[genesis|God and the mysterious ways of how he rolls]]. The majority of the Old Testament is made up of telling a lulzy world history that science would've made boring (one must admit, "And on the 3,749,158th day, the amorphous blob grew leg-like appendages" isn't very inspiring when framed and hung up on some redneck's wall). The lulz stem from whenever God, seeing that his creation is plagued with [[Newfag|sinners]] and [[The_cancer_that_is_killing_/b/|evil]], decides to [[troll IRL]]. These included actions such as [[DELETE_FUCKING_EVERYTHING|flooding the entire world]], [[Wordfilter|creating the concept of foreign languages just to confuse everybody]], [[George_Bush|slaughtering innocent children]], and [[April_Furs_Day|destroying everyone and everything having anything to do with a city full of faggotry]].

However, God has shown [[Troll's_remorse|a kinder side]], as that last act caused him to give a similar city a second chance by sending some [[Fred_Phelps|self-righteous asshole]] to tell them to cut it out. They did, but this wasn't enough for the man. Miles away, the man [[Alex_wuori|commanded God to kill them anyway]], hoping to lulz with God. The man waited for days, but God, feeling untrollish, ignored him, turning him into a [[Lolcow|weeping husk of a man]]. God let him die, leaving him and the world a message: "[[X_is_not_your_personal_army|God is not your personal army.]]" The rest of the Old Testament is pretty boring.

Basically, this half of The Bible is used as proof that [[shit nobody cares about|evolution is wrong]] and anyone who disagrees is [[irony|educated stupid]] (that MIT education of yours? FOUNDED ON LIES). It is also used by [[Ann Coulter|trolls taking the form of Christians]] to tell people that God is an [[Rush Limbaugh|abusive, alcoholic, vengeful son of a bitch]].  It is also the part of The Bible that Jews prefer. [[JEWS_DID_WTC|Not that it means anything]].

Bible trivia:

Did you know that God thought the script was weak from the start? And therefore decided to kill off [[over 9000]] characters in the first part, in a desperate measure to gain more readers?

=== [[Newfag|New Testament]] ===

It's a bit like the Old Testament, but with 100% more [[Moralfag|Jesus]], and [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY/OPERATION_RECONNECT|a lot less of God's awesome wrath]]. Basically, Jesus goes around, impressing people with His [[b/space_Day|ability to hack into reality (and put Goatse everywhere)]], sharing his [[CP|wisdom]] and [[liek|love]] for his [[Mudkips|children]] and [[Nerd_rage|flipping tables over]]. He also says [[HAHAHA_DISREGARD_THAT,_I_SUCK_COCKS|the Old Testament should be ignored]]. Many claimed he was the only perfect man. Emphasis on "only", and for good reason: nobody could stand him. They couldn't take anymore of his [[anus]] perpetually crapping out divinity, so they [[pwned|nailed him to a tree]]. Shortly afterwards, the guy who grassed him up decided he'd [[Troll's Remorse|gone too far]], so he became [[an hero]]. Not much else happens, except for Armageddon, which involves Wal-Mart and demons using our heads as toilets (No, seriously).

This half of The Bible is the one more universally accepted as the shiny, happy, [[Lame|family-friendly]] version of God. As such, it was perfect material for a great, fun-for-the-whole-family movie, which would be called ''The Passion of the Christ''. A three-hour [[guro]] flick, every God-fearing mother dragged their kids into seeing it, saying that [[Fact|the R-rating means that the material is a sensitive subject that is told in a manner that isn't sugar-coated, and is intended for persons mature enough to handle it]] (like their 6-year-old son). Despite this glimmer of intelligence, this logic is never, ever applied to any form of media unless it involves how great and superior Christianity is (''The Godfather'' was a waste of celluloid).

==Forms of Christianity==

===[[God Hates Fags|Baptist]]===

[[Image:Snakehandler.jpg|thumb|right|Baptist fighting monk in Level Three Serpent Style battle-mode.]]

[[Image:Ted-Haggard-Ehl-Oh-Ehl.jpg|thumb|right|An inspiration to all.]]

Interchangeable with [[Evangelion|Evangelicalism]], Baptist is a [[fundamentalist]] [[Scientology|cult]] of Christianity that is generally associated with people who have three teeth and [[incest|fuck their sisters]]; these people generally live in states such as [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia]], and [[South Carolina]]. Unfortunately, Baptists are also located all over the [[United States]] and [[world]]. 

Although a roaring success as a cult, there's practically nothing which all or even most Baptists can agree on that separates them from other types of Christianity, except thinking yelling "I'm saved" is the coolest thing [[ever]]. Their members are often known for their [[fascist]] political leanings and tendency to be [[fucktarded|profoundly moronic]] [[redneck]]s. Southern Baptists also often say that anyone who consumes alcohol is going to hell, which is total [[bullshit]] since half of the Bible is all about people [[college|getting drunk and fucking.]] They will stop at nothing to make sure [[YOU]] aren't having teh [[gay]] sexzorz, except when [[Ted Haggard|they are]], in which case it's for the good of Jesus. Despite wanting to [[rape]] and [[ban|pillage]] every intelligent thought outside of PRAY-AH, they've some how managed to stumble into politics to [[troll]] the [[gays]] as to keep them from [[gay|prancing in fields]] and [[fellatio|licking lollipops]]. Also, most Baptists [http://www.jhm.org/support-israel.asp <3 Jews] which is just stupid. DON'T YOU PEOPLE GET IT! [[JEWS DID WTC|THE FUCKING KIKES DID WTC]] [[Mel Gibson|AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO KILLED JESUS IN THE FIRST PLACE!]] AND THEY STILL TO THIS DAY LIE ABOUT THE [[Holocaust|HOLOCAUST]], [[CAPSLOVE|THEY DO NOT DESERVE OUR LOVE OR EVEN THE RIGHT TO LIVE, WE NEED TO MAKE THE HOLOCAUST REAL, WHO'S WITH ME???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]] [[south_park|HASSAN HASSAN!]]
{{squote|[[AIDS]] is not just God's punishment for [[homosexuals]]; it is God's punishment for the society that *tolerates* homosexuals."|[[Jerry Falwell]], PREACHIN DA' BIBLE}}

{{squote|The [[feminist]] agenda is not about equal rights for [[women]]. It is about a [[socialist]], anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their [[bitch|husbands]], kill their [[children]], practice [[Wiccan|witchcraft]], destroy [[capitalism]], and become [[lesbians]].|[[Pat Robertson]] telling the [[truth]]}}

{{squote|"You know, Jesus will not be mocked, fool. Every smart-mouth comment you post in this Godly forum is being recorded by the DOF and by Jesus himself. You won't think you're so clever once Jesus tosses you into the pits of hell, where you will surely spend eternity having your tongue peeled and your anal cavity reamed with steel brushes.|Pastor Ezekiel from [http://www.landoverbaptist.net Landoverbaptist.net]}}

Baptists control fucking [[everything]] from their Jesus-clad ivory towers in order to sell [[lies|SALVATION]] and stomp angrily at whatever happens to offend them this week. They tend to alienate the entire nation by claiming [[AIDS]], God's weapon of choice, is going to [[anal|assrape]] everyone into loving Jesus. When not blaring their love of God on every TV, radio, and newspaper, they take to [[Westboro Baptist Church|PREACHIN' TO DA MASSES]].  This usually varies from drowning people, punching them in the face, or raping eardrums through the power of extremely shitty music. The best preacher ever to be born <s>is</s> was [[Ted Haggard]] who warned the [[hypocrite|gay]] and [[hypocrite|drugged]] to lead a moral and just life. 
 
Baptist services are generally characterized as cheerful and [[fun]]. There is usually a snake-handling session with some angry rattlers, plus some spontaneous cancer and paralysis cures. Oddly, while other Christians love it, Baptists think [[batshit insane|glossolalia (speaking in tongues)]] is the [[Devil]]'s work. WTF?

A tradition that many Baptists have is to hate on Catholics because of [[shit nobody cares about|slight differences in their Christian beliefs]].  They complain that Catholics don't read the [[Bible]] and are otherwise ignorant, but what they forget to mention is that only about 10% of Baptists have even graduated [[college]]. However, this still puts them way above [[voodoo|Pentecostalists]] and [[Scientologists]].

===Fundamentalists===
Fundamentalists are not necessarily a denomination, but are usually [[XXX|hardcore]] redneck [[incest|sister-fucking]] evangelical Protestants from the Bible Belt and the Midwest, who believe that evolution is a hoax, all media entertainment is evil, and that liberals are in a grant conspiracy to destroy [[shit no one cares about|Christian values]] by forcing their kids to watch MTV and listen to Snoop Dogg. Fundamentalist Christianity is basically a [[cult]] which gives the Scientologists a run for their money.

A brief synopsis of [[fundamentalist]]s:

Fundies always ''claim'' to follow the Bible literally and exactly. They unabashedly state that [[rape]] and [[slavery]] - incredibly popular in the Old Testament, are no longer acceptable, based on the undeniable <u>[[fact]]</u> that the New Testament pushed the Old Testament into [[Old media|obsolescence]]. Trolling them is as easy as pointing to The New Testament book of Philemon (where Paul tells a runaway black person to get back to his cotton field) or Matthew 5:17-20 :
<br><center>
''Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law of Moses or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. In truth I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even the smallest stroke of a letter will pass away from The Law. So anyone who breaks the least of these commandments or teaches others to do so will be called "least" in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever practices these commandments and teaches them will be called "great" in the kingdom of heaven. say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses the experts in The Law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.''</center>

Fundies in Zion, Illinois (aka Jesusland) also taught that the [[flat earth]] theory was fact up until the 1950s (claiming that some obscure Bible passage proved that modern science was wrong about the earth being round, just like they do with evolution).

=== Catholicism ===
[[Image:Osama-Holo-Jesus.jpg|thumb|right|Christ comes in many forms.]]
[[Image:Nuns_By_Black_Plague.jpg|thumb|Religious defense]]

Cath<u>'''lol</u>i'''cs, or '''Cathyz''' as they are called [[OTI]], are just as dumb as other Christians except they worship [[Pope|a creepy old guy in a phallus-shaped hat]], pray to the [[whore|Virgin Mary]] more than they do to Jeebus, believe they're [[cannibalism|eating Jesus' real flesh and blood]] during communion, and are even bigger [[virgin|vaginaphobes]] than the Protestants (they think [[birth control|condoms]] are [[devil|teh debil]], but [[pedophilia|banging an altar boy in the ass]] isn't as bad since there's no [[vagina]] involved). Every year, the [[Catholic]] teenagers go to Rumspringa, a sort-of spiritual spring-break, where they get to commit crimes and [[fellatio|suck]] [[cock]] without getting in trouble. After they're done sucking [[cock]], they go get wasted off of Jesus [[cum|juice]].

You can identify a [[Catholic]] girl by her willingness to let you stick your penis in [[Technical virgin|any orifice but her vagoo]]. 

{{quote|[[AIDS]] is a just retribution for improper sexual misconduct"|Mother Teresa, using a double negative}}

The organization which Catholics belong to (and typically know nothing about) is the Roman Catholic Church, located in the red light district of Rome. It was founded as the [[Nazi]] [[pedophile]] division [[no more than 99]] years ago by [[Adolf Hitler]] himself. It quickly grew in numbers as [[pedo|child molesters]] joined the priesthood looking for a nice bit of [[loli]]. Today, it has branches all over the world and probably has one just round the corner from your home. You can drop the kids off there at any time!

===Lutherin===
Founded on the beliefs of Martin Luther. Not to be confused with Martin Luther King Jr.(See [[nigra]].) Martin Luther was one of the first [[IRL trolls]], in that he used to debate the ideology of Catholicism by nailing pieces of paper filled with his satanic drug induced ramblings, onto the front doors of churces before mass. 

He is to be considered a god amongst trolls, and invented the phrase [[DO IT FAGGOT]] due to the epic size of his [[balls]].

He also gets +1 Internetz because people till this day worship a religion based on his trolling.

Lutherans are a naturally depressed race, as luthrins, they have less human rights than jews in WW2. 

==== The Uniform ====
{{squote|If a [[woman]] insists on wearing clothes, at least let it be a Catholic schoolgirl uniform. I find them so hot, my [[testes]] swell like boiled eggs whenever I see one. My [[cock]] is drawn to a plaid skirt like a big pink moth to a flame. I can't describe it because it is beyond words...it is spiritual. 'Tis something more mystical than the divine mysteries of the Eucharist. It is the power of the Holy Ghost moving between a girl's thighs. <br><br>

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
[[Image:Cure for christianity.jpg|thumb|Nuff said]]

This denomination had its heyday during the Dark Ages and is basically just a Catholic spinoff. It has largely been wiped out by a combination of [[Turks]], [[Communism]], and the Catholic Church.

=== Episcopalian ===
Episcopalians just use Jesus as an excuse to drink [[alcohol]], which leads to all sorts of different interpretations of the Bible and which cocktail is right for which occasion. 

Most of the other traits of the other Christian groups are not found with the Episcopalians since Episcopalians are typically not sober and have real shit to worry about. Episcopalians typically believe in evolution, sex, drinking, and all the other good fun shit the other Christians hate. This is because most Episcopalians are normal people who just want to make it look like they do the whole go to church thing since it looks good when they are trying to get a job or pick up women. 

The typical Episcopal service on Sunday morning involves getting ready to drink at the end, followed by cocktails in the parish hall after. Then Episcopalians will have brunch where they will consume even more alcohol. By Sunday evening, they are usually passed out often in a stranger's bed, on the golf course, or are still drinking up a storm.

The majority of Episcopalians are OK with things like divorce, pre-marital sex and abortion, since when you are drunk most of the time these things can be frequent problems. Sex with priests something that both men and women can enjoy, since there are male and female priests, some of who are gay so everybody wins!

===Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses===
<br>
<center><youtube>RD7vKmglHMc</youtube></center><br><br>
[[Image:Imaginary.PNG|right|thumb|220px|Shhhh, don't let the mormons find out. They aren't the gullible type.]]

[[Mormons]] and Jehovah's Witnesses are the two weirdest offshoots of Christianity, best known for their constant pestering of everyone. Mormons believe that their church founder Joseph Mormon gained all the secrets of life by sucking on Jesus' penis in a vision in the 1800s and part of this knowledge was that all other Christians were [[DOING IT WRONG]]. He then got a visit from an angel called [[Moron]]i who said a [[JEWS DID WTC|chosen Jewish tribe had come to America]] two thousand years before Columbus and wrote a bunch of holy books and shit mainly chronicling how Jesus was an honorary American and told every Jew there to marry niggers and Native Americans so both could become white. (Silly Jesus, Jews aren't white!)

Unlike Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses don't add extra books to the Bible. But they do believe Jesus died on a stake, that there is no Holy [[The Matrix|Trinity]] and they do not believe in Hell. Like all religions, they believe that they are the only people who will be helped by God into [[buttsex|Paradise]]. However, Jehovah's also believe that the word of God is meant to be spread through whatever means possible, which means throwing Bibles at car window screens, refusing life-saving blood transfusions [[for the lulz|for vague reasons]], worshiping in Kingdom Halls rather than Churches, knocking someones door every two hours, preaching the Bible for days in the rain to people who don't give a shit, being the Artist Formerly Known As [[Prince]] and generally being bat shit insane and annoying. Witnesses and Mormons are generally exiled to states no one gives a shit about, like [[Utah]] or [[Montana]].

Other Christians harbor a strong hatred for Jehovah's and Mormons and will claim they are [[BAWWWW|oppressed]] by them as usual.(Even though they generally send mobs to kill them ) Instead of the reason for hatred being because of their annoying and bat shit insane nature like normal people, Christians hate them for minor religious differences. A Christfag will scoff at the notion of Jesus dying on a stake instead of a cross or God being one being instead of three different ones within one (PREPOSTEROUS!!!). They will laugh at the belief of Jews coming to America despite their own belief that all humans (even niggers and [[azns]]) are descended from 1,500 year old Jewish tribes. Jehovah's in return hate other Christians a lot, especially Catholics, and will take a break from their preaching to vomit on a Catholic they sense in the vicinity and wail at them and follow them around calling them [[Satan|Satanic]].

And don't forget Seventh-day Adventists! They are the worst kind. They don't eat meat, drink, smoke, have sex, smile and party. They do other weird ass shit, in ways like the Mormons or J'Ws.

[[Image:CUposter.jpg|thumb|Because the majority of the U.S. population is being persecuted. And are hypocrites.]]

===Christians and Jews===

Like all good human beings, Christians hate Jews. 

Since 1949, Christians have had a [[holocaust|hell of a time]] trying resolve their hatred of Jews with their butt fucking love of [[Israel]]. 

Most theorize that Christians are able to tolerate the Jews being in Israel because the only thing they hate moar than Jews are the [[Muslim]]s, turning the whole situation into a "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" sort of deal. Actually, that's an Arab proverb. Fuck [[Arabs]], and fuck that. It's probably just that they are confident that Jesus will return when the Temple of Solomon is rebuilt and kill all the Jews. So it's a small price to pay in the long run.

=== Christians and [[Atheists]] ===

People usually consider Christians and Atheists to be mortal enemies, where as this is really not true, as everybody knows Christians are immortal. When not calling each other names and burning each other alive, both sides come together in brotherhood to celebrate how much of a dickhead each other is for fighting and threatening medieval torture on each other. This usually ends in smex on both sides which is completely forgotten ten seconds later when they are impaling each other and showing their non-existent genitals to each other. This cycle usually continues on a weekly basis at local churches and [[emo]] cafes.

=== Christians and Quakers ===

While the Quakers may claim to be Christians, we know better. Shortly after being founded by a dude who was tired of the Christian's shit(and who some believed was Jesus himself, despite main claims to the contrary), they started advocating women's rights, the freedom of slaves, and not being pretentious douchebags who kill people for not believing the same thing. After making the state Pennsylvania, they all disappeared off the face of the planet, and only once in a while resurface to tell people to stop pointing guns at each other or beating up fags people. Quakers are Christian's worst enemies because the Quakers want to be friends with them while at the same time believing something different, which is obviously just an elaborate trap designed to lure Christians into heathenism.

===Christians and [[Rape|Basterd]] [[You|Children]]===

It would come as a suprise to [[Rational|most]], considering all christians are [[Hipocrite|prolife]] but what they don't tell you as such children are [[Buttsecks|obviously spawn of the devil]] and therefore not a part of God's plan. In other words, [[GTFO|Get the fuck out.]]

===Christian Oppression===

Christians make up around 84% of the United States, but still will always bitch and fucking moan about how oppressed they are. They are happy to shit over everybody else's viewpoints, but if you ever dare criticize Christianity, you will be accused of being "disrespectful". Example:

'''Typical Christian:''' Heathens! Hear the Word of God.
: All [[Jews]] are going to Hell because they have not accepted Jesus Christ.
:: All [[Muslims]] are going to Hell because they have not accepted Jesus Christ.
::: All [[Hindus]] are going to Hell because they have not accepted Jesus Christ.
:::: All [[Buddhists]] are going to Hell because they have not accepted Jesus Christ.
::::: All [[Wiccans]] are going to Hell because they have not accepted Jesus Christ.
:::::: All...

'''Guy:''' Wait a minute, how are those religions any less valid than Christianity?

'''Christian:''' How dare you offend my sacred, deeply held beliefs! Stop oppressing me!

'''Guy:''' [[facepalm|/facepalm]]

'''Christian:''' (in [[self-righteous]]-defiance of '''Guy''')
: 'All [[Athiests]] are going to Hell because they have not accepted Jesus Christ.
:: All [[Agnostics]] are going to Hell because they have not accepted Jesus Christ.
::: All...

=== Micah Armstrong ===
Micah Armstrong is an insane ex-priest on par with [[Westboro Baptist Church]] in terms of unexplained craziness by followers. He and his [[fanboi]]s travel to various events and college campuses uninvited to tell people why they're going to go to hell. According to Micah, you can go to hell for, smoking, drinking alcohol, playing the guitar, having a tattoo, [[Islam|girls showing any skin besides face]], being blonde, [[truth|being fat]], cursing, kissing or holding hands before marriage, having sex with anyone other than your spouse or little boys, [[What?|judging people]], [[sp/|playing sports]], being a woman, watching television, owning a pet, sinning and being any of the following religions at any point in one's life: Catholic, Jewish, [[Buddha|Buddhist]], [[Christian|Methodist]], [[Hippy|Protestant]], [[Mormon]], [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Agnostic]] or [[Atheist]].

[[Hypocrite|All this coming from a guy who doesn't believe in Jesus and hails Marx as the true savior.]]

==Christians (Internet Species)==
[[Image:HitlerJesus.jpg|thumb|180px|Jesus and [[Hitler]] are BFFs.]]
Christians love to abuse other people's space and privacy, it's their favored past time, so when the Internet was invented they boarded the Jesus train to dialup to begin their cyber Manifest Destiny of shitty propaganda. Since these times, more and more religious Christ zealots find their way online to secure God's position firmly on its grounds. These types of people inhabit almost every conceivable community that makes up the web and constantly through the day/night some asshole is quoting the bible somewhere in an effort to smite some e-foe. Luckily, Christians make up a large pool of easily trolled targets because if the Internet has taught us anything it's that everyone is a hypocrite. It's only fitting that the people who spend most of their time telling others how to live would be the most raging hypocrites out there. This trusty flaw results in massive ruin and has been a staple of dramatic events throughout history. E-Christians (aka Christfags) are no different from their offline counterparts, however, their large numbers and gestapo sects do not translate in any way online. They are weak cry-baby carebears who quit the Internet forever at the drop of their hat.

===Christianity LJ Community===

{{ljcomm|user=Christianity}} is moderated by jjostm, ariston, and pould. This community is the home of much [[drama]]. Past graduates have included [[purelily]], foxmagic, and [[Nathan Sheets]].  Once upon a time, butt sex used to be the prime object of discussion, but now all "love juice" questions are directed at {{ljcomm|user=christianitysex}}. Instead, the denizens of this community now get their holy mojo risin' via hilariously pseudo-nonchalant usage of [[Jewish]] and [[Hebrew]] terms, to make themselves sound more "authentic" or whatever.

This group is especially useful for those who suspect themselves of being damned. A quick listing of your sins will result in helpful feedback indicating not only which circle of hell you will suffer in for all eternity, but whether your assigned demons will use pitchforks or cattle prods. 

The group is able to offer this service through member myprophet, who has announced she is God's appointed voice on Earth. The Pope denies this, saying he is God's appointed voice on Earth. George [[W]]. Bush says they are both crazy blasphemers, and he is God's appointed voice on Earth. Attempts to settle the issue through a walk-that-water challenge have as yet been unsuccessful due to scheduling difficulties, however God is quoted as saying "Jesus fucking Christ, I don't know why I bother."

===Trolling===

Provided are pastas for [[troll]]ing Christians:

In the name of Satan, ruler of Earth, the King of the world, the Chief of the Serfs, I command the forces of darkness to bestow their infernal power upon us. Save us, Lord Satan, from the treacherous and the violent. Oh Satan, Spirit of the Earth, God of Liberty, open wide the gates of Hell and come forth from the abyss by these names: Satan! Ba'al Zəbûb! Leviathan! Asmodeus! Abaddon!

[[Allahu akbar]]. Ashhadu 'an la ilaha illa-allah, wa ashhadu 'anna Muhammadan rasulu-llah.
{{Main|Christian#Drama-generating_Techniques}}

A trusty example of your common Internet Christian:{{cs2|Praise Cyber Jesus!|Get your bible away from me faggot!|<pre>
 Lord Jesu Yos,u're lovely.
 You're more to be desired,
 Than any earthly pleasure.
 You're fine, beyond compare.
 Lord Jesus, Your beauty
 Does far exceed all others.
 You're comely and You're tender.
 You're radiant and You're fair.
 When I behold You Jesus,
 You draw my heart completely.
 I cannot turn away Lord,
 I rest in Your embrace;
 And time is gone there's only
 Your holy, matchless presence
 Abiding in You, gazing
 Upon Your glorious face.
 I give my life to You Lord,
 For You alone are worthy.
 There's nothing and there's no one
 That I desire but You.
 May all my days be Yours, Lord,
 My heart be given to love You,
 To treasure and to serve You
 By Your sufficient grace.
- Common E-Christian behavior</pre>|0}}

== Media ==

Although Christians believe everyone and everything related to media other than Sean Hannity is the world of the devil, the production of Christian media is at an all time [[drugs|high]].

I do hope, however, that someone slashes your dick off with a buckknife and sticks it down your throat so you will no longer be able to say hateful things against Christians. On second thought, you are probably gay, and already have someone else’s dick in your mouth. If that is the case I hope you get AIDS and die mother fucker!

'''And everything the being does is out of love, now you say "then why is bad things happening?" because long time ago he gave humuns controll of the earth, and when they broke the single rule the rights got transferred over to the devil.
'''And the being that created everything bounds himself by rules because the being wants to have the other beings able to choose what they will do.
'''And since the devil doesn't like us he wants to cause us pain, but since the being is good he made it so it wouldn't be complete torture. Now you're asking "Why would a good being send us to hell?" the reason is because the devil has control over the earth he made rules about what happens, and now the being has to work around them.'''
'''So, then the being had his son be born to die for our sins.'''
'''So, we can go to heaven insted of hell.'''
'''I can go on and on about stuff, but lets leave it at that for now.'''| This is your proper christian.|'''To be honest, that was a lie. I just jizzed into Mary's bubble bath for the lulz.'''|God's response|}}|color=blue}}

== Drama-generating Techniques ==

# Question the Bible.
# Ask what year Jesus was born.
# When surprised/excited/pissed, yell "Jesus Christ on an X!" (i.e. "[[Buttsex|Jesus Christ on a black guy's dick!]] or [[LOL WUT|Jesus H. Christ on a surfboard!]])The more obscene it is, the more lulz you will generate.
# Ask if he's a bastard child.
# Ask how many people were at his tomb.
# Ask why a crucified criminal was put in a tomb instead of a mass grave.  Fun-fact if they can't answer: One of his followers paid for the tomb.
# Make note of their [[homophobia]].
# Remind them of their latent homosexuality.
# Remind them if that they truly believed in Jesus, they wouldn't argue about it.
# Slap them and ask them to present their other cheek for similar treatment.
# Ask why the talking snake is literal but Jesus' command to sell everything they own is metaphorical.
# Give an intelligent, well-researched explanation of Einstein's views on religion.
# Give an intelligent, well-researched explanation of Hitler's views on religion.
# Give an intelligent, well-researched explanation of anything.
# Give unintelligent, poorly-researched explanations of everything.
# Point out bible quotes promoting murder, rape and slavery then point to Matthew 5:18-19.
# Ask if Cain and Abel had sex with each other or Eve to make more people.
# Ask them if they've ever had a lustful thought or [[masturbated]], and if they have, why they haven't plucked out their eye or cut off their hand.
# Ask why would God create rules that were impossible to follow, then punish the world/his followers when he could have just sent Christ and fixed everything right away?
# Point out that, based on the appearance of every other individual in the area he was born, Jesus was clearly either black or brown.
# Point at the gold cross dangling from their necklace and accuse them of worshiping a graven idol. (A golden one, no less!)
# Explain to them how they would worship an electric chair or a poison gas chamber if Jesus died 20 - 50 years ago.
# Say that Christians are tools of the Jewish-dominated Neoconservatives in control of the Republican Party. 
# Say that Mary was likely only a [[technical virgin]], considering that Jews circa 5 BCE were highly patriarchal.
# Say that [[Fact|Christianity is nothing but Judaism, version 2.0]]...
# ... and thus, [[Islam]] must be Judaism, version 3.0.
# Gently wipe the tears that begin pouring from their eyes.
# Proceed with fucking their virgin mothers.
# You can also place bibles from your local library or book store in the "fiction" section for added bonus.
# Make a point that Jesus had two fathers.
# ????
# [[PROFIT]]!!!
