Raniko
{{notice|
* Raniko went through several years of [[therapy]] and retained her male persona. This is proof you cannot cure transsexuals by manipulating them.
* [[CP|Raniko also suffered abuse at the hands of her parents]] and retained her male persona. This is proof you cannot cure transexuals by beating them.
* Raniko suddenly decided that after 13 years she really was female after all shortly after her ED article was published. [[Fursecution|This is proof Encyclopedia Dramatica will not believe any of the bullshit furries claim to be suffering]].}}


[[Image:Ranikoemo.JPG|400px|thumb|Poor baby :(]]

'''Raniko''' is a [[woman]]. No matter what she says or how large she claims her [[erection]] to be, Raniko is a woman. Not some intersexed mutant like [[Chyna]], but a genuine little lady. Remind her of this. Raniko is all you could ever want in an internet [[attention whore]]: an [[emo]], [[transsexual]] [[furry]] with a history of being abused as a child – yes, she does indeed have it all. Except a [[penis]].

==[[Transsexual|FTM tranny]]==

{{squote|
I hate yaoi. o_O Where the fuck did you get that I like it? I make fun of it, maybe you just misunderstood.|How silly of us.}}

Raniko is quite possibly the most sexually confused person on the intarwebs. Although Raniko has the body of a [[woman]], she is actually a man. Naturally, she is offended by all those [[16 year old girls]] who try to act like [[Chris Crocker|fabulous faggots]] with hair extensions creaming themselves over pictures of [[shota|underage boys]] having [[buttsecks]]. Although she is too young to have surgery or hormone treatment, Raniko insists she is becoming more and more like her true self every day.

Despite the degenerate spawn she claims to be, Raniko is clearly very confused about her orientation. Since everyone knows being [[gay]] is a choice, she seems to flip between being [[homosexual]] (meaning she likes women. She's a [[man]] remember) and being a [[faggot]] (since she claims to have a boyfriend):

<center><gallery>
Image:Ranikotranny4.JPG|First she claims to be like a [[faggot]] in the closet...
Image:RanikoBF.JPG|Then boasts about her boyfriend... 
Image:Ranikotranny.JPG|Then claims to be straight, since she is actually a guy and likes [[pussy]].
[[Image:Ranikoshota.JPG|thumb|She's also a [[pedo]]. Another addition to Rankio's already long list of twisted sexuality.]]
</gallery></center>

[[Some argue]] Raniko is simply a [[lesbian]] since, despite her love of [[women]], she obviously craves the cock. Like all [[lesbians]], she also strongly denies that she is a carpet-muncher since she does actually want a [[penis]]. Such ideas and arguments only [[Littlecloud]] could understand.

===Further Sexual Confusion===

Both before and after her [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] article was published, Raniko had a deeply confused concept of sexuality - [[faggots]], [[transsexual|trannies]] and intersexed hermaphrodites were all mixed together in a melting pot of deviancy.

Now combine this with the fact she hates femboys, [[yaoi]] fangirls and "People who pretend to be FTM trannies just to get attention." . . .

Image:Raniko OC fags.PNG|And she just so happens to be a man with a pussy.
Image:Raniko Kyuu.PNG|It's a sad, sad day when even the [[liberals]] are sick of your bullshit.
</gallery></center>

===Drama===

Like all good [[emos]], Raniko claims to have been [[raped]] at least three times – but no matter! Far from being depressed and frightened like most rape victims, she breaks out of her gloomy little shell and fondly remembers the fun she had at [[FA]]:

<center><gallery>
Image:Ranikoraped1.JPG|Of course had he known what he was touching he would have left her alone.
Image:Ranikoraped2.JPG|See? Raniko isn't all doom and gloom!
</gallery></center>

When the regular bullshit she makes up is not irritating enough, she will go into a long repetitive tirade about:

* How she is being oppressed for being transsexual (or, believe it or not, being mistaken for a woman).

* The various illnesses and/or injuries she is suffering.

* Further internet bullshit i.e. ''[[Second Life]]'', her computer crashing, commissions going wrong, etc.

* [[CP|Her abusive parents.]]

[[Image:Ranikotranny2.JPG|thumb|Most sensible mothers would do the same.]]

Her [[your mom|mother]] and [[Daddy|father]] are the greatest cause of her online bitching, as her dad has accepted his daughter's [[faggotry|gender-confusion]] and her mother has not. 

===Mental illness===

[[Image:Ranikotranny3.JPG|left|250px|thumb|Raniko is kind enough to give the world a full list of teh things she <s>shlicks</s> [[fap|faps]] to.]]

As well as the wonderful selections above, she also claims to be an idiot savant – a [[retard]] with the mind of a genius. This, of course, is not so as genuine savants don’t have the ability to scribble in their e-journals about how they wish they were dead. In addition, she has many [[drama|emotional scars]] as a result of her abusive upbringing. Of course, [[furfaggotry]] in itself is a mental illness, so there is little point in listening to her.

Raniko has a crippling fear of "Love Roller Coaster" by the Ohio Players, claiming it gives her nightmares:

{{squote|I can't listen to 'Love Rollercoaster' by the Ohio Players. That song gives me nightmares.

I was being driven home the other day and it came on the radio. I was dozing off in the passenger's seat...

And suddenly, in the middle of the song, I heard this weird screaming sound. It scared me so bad I jumped in my seat. It's IN THE SONG. It sounds so fucking scary. Like a dying...something.

I didn't even want to hear it again, but I checked [[YouTube]] to see if it was a part of the song and when I heard it again, I couldn't sleep with the lights off.

I realize that kind of thing makes me look like a pussy, but dear lord, it was scary. Those kinds of things scare me badly. :( I lose nights of sleep thanks to simple things that freak me out.|Ramiko|being a pussy.}}


==Raniko & Ragnarok Online==
Being the loving person that she is - Raniko does not limit herself to one person. She is happy to share her [[mangina]] to the rest of the world, including [[men]], [[women]] and [[animal abuse|animals]] (fictional or not). But as anyone who has not been living under a rock will know, [[furries]] are happy to hump anything cute and fluffy.

After being banned ''twice'' from a [[Drama|RP-based]] [[Ragnarok Online]] server [[Last Thursday|last Thursday]], s/he/it went on to start her own, which as later deleted. The following are examples of her most frequented characters, at least one of which was remade on her own server while still running.

===UPDATE===
Having destroyed her own server, and failing to destroy another, Raniko fell back on a previous server, where she befriended and then met someone [[IRL]].

{{squote|
[+Grin] why did no one show me her ED article -before- i let the bitch in my house?.|[[Idk|IDK, my BFF Jill?]]}}

{{bigpic|Ranikoaugust.jpg|frame|200|The irony.}}

<pre>[+Grin] FREE AT LAST FREE AT LAST!
[+Grin] vin's gone
[Mia[ptfo]] lol
[+Grin] YESYESYESYESYES
[Mia[ptfo]] Where'd Vin go?
[+Grin] fuck if i care
[+Grin] bitch threatened to break every window in my house this morning
[+Hotaru] ..damn
[+Yubi_Shines] Goodness.
[+Grin] thats not even half of it
[+Grin] theres filing false police reports, the fact she's a fuckin two face bitch, and that she got my parents involved
[+Grin] i need a drink
[+Yubi_Shines] That's, um, pretty special.
[+Grin] theres the fact she's threatening to sue me over her tablet when she owes me 800 and change
[+Yubi_Shines] ...a good tablet costs like 300 clams
[+Yubi_Shines] Excepting the insane $2000 ones
[+Grin] then she still owes me 500
[Mia[ptfo]] What happened to the tablet?
[+Grin] she'd didn't take it with her in the running for her life stage of getting the fuck out of my house
[+Yubi_Shines] Well, my point was that you generally sue when the money on the line is bigger than a few hundred bucks
[+Grin] bah. you puny "logic" has no effect on vin
[Mia[ptfo]] yeah someone stole my PSP and I have proof of such, but I didn't even bother. Wasn't worth the time.
[Mia[ptfo]] And the landlord from our old apartment isn't giving us our security deposit back due to BS reasons but I'm not bothering with that either. ... although I do want to burn the apartment down.
[+Hotaru] Sounds like you had an..interesting few days.
[[+Grin] you don't have a fuckin clue
[+Grin] excuse me. i need alcohol
[+Grin] mmmm beer
[+Tox] Vin...wasn't there a Vin in here? oO
[+Grin] yes

[+Grin] why did no one show me her ED article -before- i let the bitch in my house?
[+Tox] ..ED? o.o
[+Grin] encyclopedia dramatica.
[+Grin] a friend linked me to her page</pre>

[[TL;DR|Tl,dr;]] bitch got called out on her bullshit and proceeded to flee when Grin pondered [[Murder|doing what everyone has considered]]. Her lying about almost being raped is nothing new, but it has not been documented/confirmed to be bullshit until now. It also proves that ED can be educational, much like watching someone getting eaten by a bear teaches you a bear will fuck your shit up.

Syrae Universe (6:43:12 PM): then complains about not getting commissions?
Syrae Universe (6:43:31 PM): That's because no one wants to for someone who only works when she feels like it.
Syrae Universe (6:43:40 PM): When paid, you should do the job and get it over with.

Syrae Universe (6:54:48 PM): Cause she will only gripe and complain more.</pre>

[[TL;DR|Tl,dr;]] The dumbass likes to pick on other artists and slander them just because no one wants to commission a slacking pedophile. She also attacks her own friends for buying art from her enemies.

[[TL;DR|Tl,dr;]] Fucking asskisser starts out by complimenting our favorite [[lulzcow]] on ED; [[SapphyDracases]] by flattering her artwork instead of trolling it like she always does. Which is it bitch, do you like her art or do you not? Make your fucking mind up you fail [[faggot]].

Sapphirus: k..

Vango: would you rather get ten bucks or something else? maybe a trade instead
Sapphirus: Nah, I was just really suprised because i thought you hated my art.
Vango: dude, i don't hate your art - i wouldn't have sent you a tablet in hopes you'd practice
Vango: if i hated your art
Sapphirus: True.
Vango: i like to see artists succeed, and even with your attitude, you're still trying to learn
Vango: and you're still getting better and better
Sapphirus: thanks 
Vango: you're welcome, don't get too emotional on me though.. #SR
Sapphirus: xDD

Sapphirus: I had fun with it to be honest xD!
Vango: good, lol</pre>
[[TL;DR|Tl,dr;]] Raniko commisioned [[SapphyDracases]] for a shittastic art piece consisting a frowning bitching [[cock]], a sandwhich and a candlestick and a nuclear [[douche]]?! This goes to show how hypocritical Raniko is when she states that someone's art sucks and them commisions them right after. This piece of [[crap]] can be found here http://sapphydracases.deviantart.com/art/Wacky-Commision-149483805 '''UPDATE''': Someone has drawn a nuclear douche before! Vango did this to get the fat bitch in trouble for stealing another shitty artist's concept. Original ''Nuclear Douche'' can be found HERE: http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2442787/

==Reactions to Her Article==

Raniko's reaction to having her very own article is as confusing as her stance on being a [[bisexual]] shemale - although she initially seems very calm about it, there are several tell-tale signs that perhaps she is not as happy about being on Encyclopedia Dramatica's hit list as she says. 

===Her Love of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]===
Since discovering she had her very on page on this wiki Raniko claims she has the ability to laugh at herself and has even sent links to this page all around the internet (just like [[Firedarkdragon#Reaction_to_ED|Firedarkdragon did]] which we all know worked so well). 
Of course if Raniko does ever want to edit her page she is free to do so. [[Special:Userlogin|We would welcome her with open arms]].

{{bigpic|Raniko ED.png|frame|200|We're happy for you too Raniko.}}

===Raniko on [[Furcadia|Failcadia]]===
Vin/Vango also has a nasty habit of pretending so hard that SHE actually enjoys the [[lulz]] when in fact you can tell on the other side of the screen she's about to either cry or toss the monitor right out the window. She LOVES to try and blend in with the other [[Troll|trollers]] in an attempt to feel she is part of the flock or that nothing bothers her. She will actually rant on and on about how NOTHING bothers her, a big BIG continuity of how you should understand that nothing YOU say to her makes her BAWWWW and the entire time she insists on making it fact, she really is just bawwwwing about it. 
Her high and mighty online ego is only served right next to her big fag e-penis in the quest to make herself look better, braver and "cooler" than anyone else on the internet. Of course we all know where that always ends up. [[Basement dwellers]] of America RISE UP!

==='''UPDATE!!! IT ADMITS IT'S A GIRL!!!'''===
Magically she also claims she is no longer a tranny - proving that contrary to what therapists say, being a [[transsexual]] is a choice and so-called sufferers should just snap out of it.

{{squote| But yeah. I lost interest entirely, despite being thoroughly convinced for 13 years.|Raniko, finally giving up on her FTM Tranny [[Faggotry|Fad]]}}

Its true. On the [[Last Thursday|13th of October 2008]] Raniko was questioned in an MSN chat as to when she would [[fail|fuck up her body irreparably by having her vagoo mutilated and turned into a fake cock]], she told [[Raptor Jesus|the EDiot they call Grobino]] that ''I very recently had a change of heart, and I'm not doing anything. ~~'' He/She/It is also getting sick of people asking because ''I'm not reassigning anything. People ask me that all the time.'' Evidently [[Trap|Raniko]] needs to realize that if she puts up [[shit nobody cares about|shocking news]] people are going to [[fap|take a keen interest]].

===[[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|DELETE (almost) EVERYTHING]]===
[[Image:Raniko Argue.PNG|left|thumb|We'll never forget you either . . .]]
Despite having plenty of success on [[DevianTART]] (by [[tartlet]] standards) shortly after showing her ED article to the world Raniko abruptly left [[DA]]. This may or may not have had something to do with the [[pain series]] collection which briefly had a home on this page while she was announcing her pride to the world.

<center><gallery>
Image:Raniko Leave 1.PNG|Sadly it won't last.
Image:Raniko Leave 2.PNG|Of course not.
</gallery></center>

[[You]] will be happy to know Raniko is still merrily [[masturbating]] on [[Furaffinity]] - where furries are alot less tolerant of [[ED]].


===ANOTHER UPDATE!===

Raniko has just admitted to being a boy on Fridays, a girl on Sundays and a [[hermaphrodite]] in June. She also appears to have trouble keeping her [[lie|stories]] consistent, and [[Trying too hard|enjoys updating her own ED article]] with such [[shit nobody cares about|shocking confessions]] ([http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Raniko&diff=1998228639&oldid=1998166531 no, really]). But we're all just here to have [[yiff|fun]], right?

Raniko also has a terrible, horrible grudge against a [[White|hispanic]], bitchy artist by the name of [[fat|Syrae Universe]]. Apparently, spending time trying to find proof to exploit the white spick rather than trying to improve her own shit or get off the computer and find a fucking job. Way to go, you pokemon-fuckin idiot. Why not try to find something better to do with your time, like masturbate to kiddy porn that you make.

* Did you know if you constantly call her a girl and say she's a she, she'll BAWWWWWW in seconds?
* Her favorite past time is bashing other artists who are getting more art sales than her, even from her small group of friends. I WONDER [[theft|WHY]].
