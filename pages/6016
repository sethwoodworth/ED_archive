Only 2 percent
{{Forced Meme}}
[[Image:Frieza uses 2 percent.jpg|thumb|Too badass to use 3%.]]
Using '''only 2 percent''' of your power is a [[last Thursday|recent]] [[forced meme]] that has taken [[4chan|/b/]] by the power of its [[faggot|shit storm]]. 

The [[meme]] got its origins from a few episodes of the ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' [[anime]] in which Frieza fights Goku using, of course, only 2 percent of his power level. [[Some argue|Many would argue]] that using only 2% of your power level is somehow stronger than an average power level of [[over 9,000]]. However, the truth is that when using 2% of your power level, you can also simultaneously have it over 9000.

It has been agreed upon that comparing what you can do when limited to only 2 percent of your power is a badass way to compete. Whether it's by [[Mudkips]], [[pr0n]], impressive displays of destroying planets, or of course by posting Freiza using only 2 percent of his power, [[some argue]] that /b/tards have gained a new means with which to spread their [[Newfag|pestilence]] upon the rest of the [[internet]].

===Reasons For Using Only 2 Percent of Your Power Level===
*"Using only 2% of my power level" is an excellent thing to yell while having [[buttsecks|sex]].
*Frieza can [[rape|destroy]] planets with 2% - think of [[Nothing|the things you are capable of doing]].
*It is a new [[forced meme]] and so everyone on /b/ will be [[spam]]ming it for years. Why not [[cancer|help out]]?
