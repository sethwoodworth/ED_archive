On April 3, [[2009]] a batshit insane 41-year-old, [[paranoid]]-schizophrenic [[gook]] -'''Jiverly Voong'''- went on a [[high score]] rampage at a center for wannabe [[Americunt|U.S. Citizens]] in [[santorum|Binghamton]], New York. The American Civic Association Building is a place that provides [[tacos|immigration and refugee services]], including [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER|language classes]]. It also recently provided targets for psychotic [[commie|Viet Cong]] sleeper agents.

The [[24/7]] news networks were initially all over this like <s>white</s> yellow on rice but - as usual - had very few details. When the smoke cleared, they reported 14 confirmed kills including [[Charlie]], 4 injured in critical condition and 41 <s>hostages</s> escapees. It's reported that before his first kill, he shouted "[[AZN|SPESHOW JERIVERLY BITCHES]]." Voong [[anhero|self-pwnt]] before running out of ammo or live targets falling miserably short of [[Cho Seung Hui]]'s VTech Massacre record.

The first official press conference reported 6 hours later that the as yet the Anonymous Charlie is known to the authorities and used a borrowed car to block off the back door to the building before entering the front door and shooting the receptionist. Also confirmed was that two handguns and a satchel full of ammo had been recovered among the dead who included some [[Chinks]], [[Pinoys]] and an [[Iraqi]] woman who [[irony|had moved to America to escape the violence in Baghdad]].

==Broken News: Crack, Ass and Dong==

[[Image:01 exclusiveeverything.jpg‎|thumb|Jiverly's crap]]

Three days after the killings, the [[Web 1.0|USPS]] finally got around to delivering Wong's [http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gRH12ZDCDlTBxsiiVpPWW-LHTpSAD97D8DS80 "suicide note",] a rambling two page letter in [[ALL CAPS]] where Wong blamed his fragile mental state on the local cops, who are all alcoholics, who were apparently watching him [[fap]] at night and inappropriately touching his [[cock]] while he slept. According to Wong, they were also stealing his [[money|dong]]. He also accused cops of "[[engrish|giving me a lot of ass]]" and that "[[lol wut|COP TAKE SIT IN MY HOUSE WHEN I SLEEPING. COP TAKE SIT IN MY HOUSE THIRTEEN TIME]]".

Police denied any wrongdoing however, [http://www2.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/090404_Upstate_Shooters_Angry_Life_and_Death local police said] Mr. Wong had previously caught the attention of law enforcement officials in 1999 after they received a tip that he was planning a bank robbery and had a [[crack]] habit.

[[Tom Cruise]] was quick to point out that there is/was [[psychiatry|absolutely nothing wrong]] with Mr. Wong that a few vitamins and horseshoe crab couldn't fix despite a [[why do you hate America?|deep loathing for America]] and [[The Man]].

===The Viet Cong (not Viet Kong)===
Jiverly Wong, sadly, worked at a vacuum cleaner plant as suction dummy to test the vacuum's suction power. Given his insurmountable anguish due to the pain being shared by him and his tiny [[cock|wang]], he decided enough was enough. He lost his job a week later and as he walked out told one of his co-workers that "[[American]] sucks!" and that he was going to go get some Lo Mein from the local "Dragon Ken" [[Chinese]] restaurant.

Apparently, Jivvy has not been to Australia before. If Jivvy had been to Australia, Jivvy would have told his co-worker how much he loves America, since being Azn in Australia is just like being a Black Muslim Jew.

Whilst the skeletal details have yielded little to nothing of the shooters name, beefs or actual firepower, the story has already spawned [[4chan]]'s first mini-[[meme]] of the event...

...this after some [[b|/b/tard]] in Binghamton revealed that he had been on his way to die in that part of town but had been saved by [[4chan]]. And you have a nice day.
