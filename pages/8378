Things With Faces
__NOTOC__

[[Image:LOLchair.jpg|thumb|[[LOLCHAIR]]]]

Found faces on inanimate objects are a popular subject of [[internets]] photography.  Don't ask me why, I guess people are bored and have a lot of free time on their hands.  Psychologists say that there is a part of the brain that recognizes human faces. I know <s>because of my learnings</s> because every fucking article about this stuff says so.  This may or may not be true, however, because these articles only [[Wikipedia|mention it but never back it up with any actual information]].  Also, for some reason these things are popular on [[420chan]]. Im not sure, but this may be due to the fact that your average 420channer would probably be somewhat more comfortable [[stoned|having a conversation with a toaster]] than most out there, I don't know.
