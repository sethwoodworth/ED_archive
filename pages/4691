LJ User Secrets
'''LJ User Secrets''' was a [[crap]] website for [[LiveJournal]] users to post anonymous secrets about each other. The last incarnation, http://ljusersecrets.suckafree.ws, and its owner {{lj|footballmod}} disappeared on February 24, 2008 - once and for all leaving the 'regulars' nothing to do but get off the computers and feed their brats. 

Most of the "secrets" are [[pop parenting|angry LJ mommies]] calling each other's kids ugly and {{ljcomm|brutal_honesty}} members calling each other ugly. People post repeatedly about drama that happened months ago, so only one in every 100 posts actually qualifies as a "secret." 

Popular topics include {{lj|ladygaia87}}'s greasy hair, {{lj|habibekindheart}}'s dead kid, and [[Animal Dreams]]'s affair with [[Mengus]].

Not to be mistaken for {{ljcomm|ljusersecrets}}, which has had negative secrets banned by [[LJ Abuse]] and thus is even more full of [[shit nobody cares about]].
