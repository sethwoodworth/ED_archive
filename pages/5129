Mai Waifu
''This article is about [[Marry Your Favorite Character Online|internet marriage]], not to be confused with [[Marriage|real marriage]].''<br/>

Every person feels a special connection to a [[Significant other|special someone]]. Sometimes that special someone isn't a person. For [[furries]], this is a [[fursuit]], but for [[weeaboos]], this is '''Mai Waifu'''. Mai Waifu is an [[Otaku]] phrase meaning "My Wife". A waifu is an [[anime]] character that a fan feels a special attachment to; [[some say]] this is [[AIDS|unhealthy]]. The phrase originates from a random scene from ''[[Azumanga Daioh]]''. [[weeaboo|Weeaboos]] typically appear in Mai Waifu threads in order to [[circle jerk|talk]] about their favorite anime character and their feeling towards them.

Somewhere in an alternate universe your waifu dreams about you, her husbando.
She frequents a board very much like this one and she posts pictures of you, In this dimension you are a star of your very own slice of life anime.
She has a folder on her computer dedicated to you, it is over 10 GB big and has every conceivable fan art, rule 34, and picture related to you, She sleeps with a tear stained body pillow with your image on it, She is madly in love with you and only you .|Anonymous [http://green-oval.net/cgi-board.pl/a/thread/32761606#p32761762 32761762]

Has your waifu inspired you or motivated you to do anything extraordinary in your life?

For example, my waifu inspired me to pick up the guitar and learn to play it, and now I already have an electric one, and am pretty decent at it.

She inspires me to go work out and stay healthy, because I know she wants me to be fit and healthy.

Since I found my waifu, I lead a lot better life and am a lot happier. And the best thing about it, 3D girls don't even interest me anymore, which saves a lot of time and money.|Anonymous [http://tohno-chan.com/mai/topic/640058 640058]
