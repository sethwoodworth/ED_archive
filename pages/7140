<div style="clear:left;"></div>
'''Ryulong''' is a [[LOL WUT|41 year old]] (according to his [[Lie|birth year of 1967]]) Jewish [[Otakukin]] living with his gay lover [[Danny]] in Miami, [[Florida]]. Like most [[Florida]] Jews, he grew up (so to speak) in [[Long Island]], [[New York]]. Calling him Jewranger really gets him [[butthurt]].

A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Ryulong/Proposed_decision#Ryulong_desysopped former] [[Wikipedia]] [[Sysop]], Ryulong was brought to power in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Ryulong_3 rigged election] [[W|George W]] would be proud of, and even then only with blessing of [[Bureaucratic_Fuck#Raul654|Raul654]] because "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&diff=102852563&oldid=102852385 I like him]". Ryulong has been making admin abuse sexy again ever since. TOW's most formidable line of defense against [[Vandalism|vandals]] and [[trolls]], he is feared by all for using his admin powers like a [[furry|pig]] in [[shit]] to unerringly dominate any article about Japanese faggots [[Circle jerk|beating each other off]] in rubber suits. He just sits at his computer, hitting refresh on [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent changes]], [[Wikistalking|waiting, watching]] for [[you]] to make an edit so he can revert it. Although he [[Essjay|claims to be a chemical oceanography/anthropology major]], he only edits articles about [[Pokemon]], [[Power Rangers]], [[Wapanese|Japanese Power Rangers]], and [[Kamen rider|Kamen Riders]], which just screams [[Autism|autistic]] [[Thirteen year old boy|teenager]].  

Ryulong has an account on ED, and he is very keen that assertions made about him on this page have appropriate references.  Surprisingly, it took much longer for him to be banned here than at [http://transformers.wikia.com Transformers Wiki] and the [http://go.to/transmasters/ Transmasters Forums].<sup>[2]</sup> 

Jewranger freaks out if you upload and label an image incorrectly on Wikipedia, and forces people to upload images he wants on Wikipedia for his [[masturbation|own use]].  He is also a humongous [[Naruto]] fan, [http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/User:Ryulong loving Naruto almost as much as he loves Wikipedia], and frequently [[come]]s on the Naruto Wiki.

Ryulong's psychic abilities give him the power to permanently block people from Wikipedia if he simply anticipates some "disruptive editing," even when the person was merely responding on a talk page in a completely "civil" manner.<sup>[3]</sup>

When a vandal compromised an admin account, the first thing to do was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Ryulong ban Ryulong].

Ryulong is also the one who blocked people from creating a TOW article on [[an hero]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=protect&user=Ryulong&page=An+hero&year=&month=-1]


==[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Ryulong|The truth about Ryulong]]==
<blockquote>"He can't help it he doesn't have anything better to do than be an ass to kids on the web. I bet his life is sad, full of sitting naked in a bean bag chair watching anime and eating ramen raw out of the bag." &ndash; [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARyulong&diff=150342386&oldid=150342358]</blockquote>

==That's just cold==
A woman comes to Wikipedia for help:
<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">I don't know where to exactly go my friend has 3 babies a soon to be x husband who is in jail now left her with no money and she has a job but her landlord told her she has until saturday to come up with $500 dollars to pay the rent or she is out on the street with 3 babies, I'm trying to find services to help her and I know I'm not on the right page but I can't seem to find the right one Please she needs help I've gave them food but I don't have that type of money.. Please help me to help my friend you can email me at isissilvermoon27@yahoo.com Thank You for reading this and if you could help point me in the right direction.... Thank You</blockquote>

Classic Ryulong: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=142196388 revert], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Isissilvermoon27 ban, and block email!] The victim gets no answer. Maybe her friend should've had an [[abortion]] instead of a ton of kids from a crack-dealing black person! The mother subsequently confirmed having to sell her body for money.

==Child abuse==
<blockquote>From Ryulong <ryulong67@gmail.com> To "Aywana Txxxxxxx" < xxxxxxxxxx@lycos.com> ''Listen. I don't care if you are 13, or whatever. Stop vandalizing my page at the Japanese Wikipedia. It's your own fucking fault for impersonating me TWICE and I got my user name changed to the one that I should have had in the first place. Go edit Bulbapedia. I couldn't care less what you do over there. If you want, bring up your ban to the ArbCom at the English Wikipedia, but then all you can edit is your case. Just LEAVE ME ALONE YOU GOD DAMN CHILD.''</blockquote>

Through this hateful diatribe, Jewranger tells us that [[weeaboo|he]] has [http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%A9%E7%94%A8%E8%80%85:Ryulong an account on Japanese Wikipedia]. And what an amusing history he has had there! Young Aywana impersonated him with "Ryuulong" and did some hilarious vandalism.

As a matter of fact, Ryulong has accounts on many different versions of Wikipedia, including Wikipedia in [http://vo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geban:Ryulong Volapuk], a language invented by some 19th century [[Poland|Polish]] dude, as well as [http://pdc.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ryulong "Pennsylvania Dutch,"] an old-fashioned dialect of German spoken only by religious extremists of the Pennsylvania countryside, who ride around in a horse & buggy, and don't even use electricity, let alone [[internet]]s. How about [http://na.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ryulong Nauruan]? Spoken only on a [[Nauru|small shithole island]] in the South Pacific, this language served for some time as Australia's dumping ground for illegal boat people arriving on tourist beaches. [http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ryulong Simple English]? Yes. Also, some ridiculous Chinese coastal dialect that uses letters instead of Chinese characters.

The question remains: Why? Isn't he a Jewish 19 year old, goin' to college, livin' by the beach, counting his Jew gold, havin' the time of his life? Why spend hours mucking around in Wikipedias that are even more of a joke than the main one, a place where he spends pathologically too much time already? 

Ryulong says Frida Kahlo is his favorite artist, because "her presence can be humorous in the right situation." This is really [[fucktard]]ed because all he knows about the self-obsessed [[emo]] [[attention whore]] Frida Kahlo was in the shitty movie about her.


==He is the cancer that is killing /b/==
Ryulong is widely known as [[the cancer that is killing /b/]]. While always controlling [[4chan]] articles like a [[/b/tard]], he shows contempt for everything /b/. He has always hated [[Habbo|Habbo Raids]], he [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=&page=Image%3A4chan-frontpageJuly.jpg won't let 4chan update their screenshot,] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ryulong/Archive_15#4chan_Page he won't even correct media portrayal of 4chan]. If he was true to /b/, he would correct false things like the [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS]] Fox propaganda. The [[furries]] on Wikipedia have always ignored how the media portrays them and just went on to write [[furluminati|what they considered the truth.]] But not Ryulong. He hates 4chan.

He hates /b/ memes, including [[Chocolate Rain]].  Example:
*21:15, 8 August 2007 Ryulong (Talk | contribs) deleted "Talk:Chocolate rain" (per current deletion of Chocolate Rain) 
*21:15, 8 August 2007 Ryulong (Talk | contribs) deleted "Chocolate rain" (per current deletion of Chocolate Rain)

Currently Ryulong considers he created all memes himself, his favorites include [[Ceiling Cat]], surprised nigger, and an unfunny version of "banana phone".  He shows hatred towards certain memes such as [[Chocolate Rain]], [[Slowpoke]], [[Rick Roll]], and others mainly because his friends peer-pressured him into thinking so. It is truly a wonder that other admins haven't permab& him yet. 

==Ryulong is no newb. He knows how to deal with criticism==
Unlike some n00b bureaucratic fucks, Ryulong knows how to deal with criticism. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=next&oldid=146861376 Revert] it in under a minute and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:88.84.149.125 ban] the IP for life. Good thing he took care of it properly, or else he'd [[SlimVirgin|end up in the news]].

==Ryulong's profiles==
Ryulong is a regular and also a lurker on websites such as http://rangerboard.com and http://henshinjustice.com. Here are his profiles for both [http://rangerboard.com/member.php?u=16939 Rangerboard] and [http://forums.henshinjustice.com/member.php?u=1749 HenshinJustice]. His best friends are [http://forums.henshinjustice.com/member.php?u=383 YellowStranger] and [http://forums.henshinjustice.com/member.php?u=1895 Ladymercury]. He spends alot of time in the HenshinJustice irc @rizon.net. Please use this info wisely.  '''FACT''' Raids on him and his friends make him cry and he will vanish from the internet LOL.  Ryulong even created a second account on ED under the username [[User:FaggotryreignsED|FaggotryreignsED]], giving into the trolls and deciding to cry about it.  He now has a third ED account because his last one was exposed as a samefag.  This third account is [[User:Tokuraws|Tokuraws]]. He just might be back.

==Dragons==
Ryulong is [[furry|totally enthusiastic]] about dragons. He is the former owner of www.dracoisland.tk, which resolved to www.geocities.com/ryulong6787.

<blockquote><p>[[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|I took the Inner Dragon online quiz and found out I am a Copper Dragon on the inside. My Inner Dragon is the mighty warrior of dragon-kind. It's just that simple. Coppers show up when someone's about to die. Coppers don't mess around, and they don't play evil games like Red Dragons. They don't bother with magic, like Gold Dragons. They exist for a purpose, and they serve it well.]]</p>

<p>[[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|But what sort of a dragon would I be if that really was the whole story? I also like to stomp my enemies, start the occasional war, and spend lazy hours preening my battle aura. My favorable attributes are strength, physical abilities, thriftiness, warmth, and longevity in battle. Just in case some puny human (or conniving Red Dragon) thinks they can get the drop on me, I've got a concealed breath weapon - gigantic masses of Fire. Hey, it's the tried and true way to cook a cow in 0.75 seconds.]]</p></blockquote>

==How to Troll==
===Nominate his pet articles for deletion===
Ryulong is always threatening to ban people for trying to delete his non-notable Kamen rider and Power Rangers articles. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AConflict_of_interest%2FNoticeboard&diff=274304381&oldid=274287459#Admin_in_clear_COI_reverting_changes_to_articles_which_encompass_a_project_he_is_affilated_with][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tokusatsu&diff=prev&oldid=272424670]
Here's a quote [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Sky_Tate&diff=267141867&oldid=267131852]:

{{quote|'''Keep''': Notable characters of a notable television program, notability exists beyond the work of fiction itself. If you put anything else up for AFD with this same rationale (no sources, but you clearly know it's notable), I will seek that you be blocked Mythdon.—[[User:Ryulong|<font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font>]] ([[User talk:Ryulong|<font color="gold">竜龙</font>]]) 06:22, 29 January 2009 (UTC)}}

A great way of trolling is nominating his pet articles for deletion.  Don't do this on an account with less than 50 edits as you don't want the trolling to be too obvious, but if the account has been around a while, just pretend to be some ordinary [[deletionist]].  Wait until the AFD for one has finished before doing the next so you can milk as much lulz as possible from it.

===Reminding him about being open to recall===
Note this comment made by him from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Ryulong his first RfA], and repeated requests for his status to be reviewed.

<blockquote>
'''Optional question from [[User:Lar|Lar]]:'''
:'''5.''' (one big long question about categories of admins and your thoughts about them) Are you aware of the notion of adminstrators saying they're willing to be voluntarily recalled or reviewed, by a less onerous process than a new RfA (or worse) arbComm action? What do you think of the idea? Would you consider placing yourself (placement should only be done by oneself) in such a category if you were made an admin? Why or why not? Are you aware of the notion of Rouge admins? What do you think of the notion? Do you see it as purely humorous or do you see what it's driving at? Would you consider allowing yourself to by placed in this category (placement is traditionally done by someone else) if you were made an admin? Why or why not?  (note: both these categories have some controversy attached to them, for different reasons, and note also, although I am a policy and process [[WP:WONK|wonk]] I am in both categories, and finally, note that there is no wrong answer here...) ++[[User:Lar|Lar]]: [[User_talk:Lar|t]]/[[Special:Contributions/Lar|c]] 18:31, 6 August 2006 (UTC)
::I was not aware about voluntary recall/review, but if such a situation were to occur if I were to become an admin, I would not object to such a review. It would give me constructive criticism as to my (currently hypothetical) status as an admin and my faults as an editor, just as the various opposition votes below are calling into question now. I have heard about Rouge admins to an extent, but I have not really looked into the situation (the most I know is that "Rouge" is purposefully used instead of "Rogue", and I can discern that it must mean that the admins have gone rogue/AWOL/amok in some form). I do see that the process of Rouge admins is calling into question the faults of the user, albeit in a humorous fashion. If another admin felt I was going "Rouge", then I would take it as it was intended, constructive (yet funny) criticism. Now, I have to see what "WP:WONK" is. [[User:Ryulong|Ryūlóng]] 23:16, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

His university "career" can't last forever; he'll have to cut back on his OCD fixation with Power Rangers: Jungle Fury someday.

However, by 2009 this techinque had been done enough that no one even notices it and people just leave it.  Hell, it's even used several times on his arbritration case [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Ryulong#Statement_by_involved_Are_you_ready_for_IPv6.3F][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Ryulong/Evidence#Ryulong_abused_the_trust_of_the_community_when_he_promised_in_his_RFA_to_be_open_to_recall_and_then_reneged_on_that_promise]

==Quotes==
* At [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&oldid=216617630#MascotGuy], he said, "MascotGuy isn't a vandal. He's just an autistic boy with nothing better to do than try and improve our articles in ways that end up doing more harm than good."  It sounds more like Ryulong is talking about himself.

==Butthurt==

Ryulong [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Ryulong/Proposed_decision pissed off]  the wrong people. He was taken to [[wikipedo]]'s [[Arbcom|e-court]] where he got desysopped. 

==Using 26 sockpuppets at one time to cause the mass edit conflict glitch==
One of Ryulong's greatest crowning achievements, when scanning through AN and ANI discussions it can be found where he will often purposely use 26 sockpuppets at one time to create a mass "edit conflict" error glitch. While this is ongoing a curious malfunction of wikipedia occurs. The key number is 26, as the site can handle 25. 

The user running all the sockpuppets can then edit without their edits appearing in the logs, meaning they can make any edit and no one will know they did it. He uses this one often to change people's edits or to make edits for them. Always of course threatening others which gets them blocked. He is considered by many to be one of the most devious sockpuppeteers.
