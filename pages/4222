'''Jaranda''' "'''[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stewards/elections_2007/statements/Jaranda Jorge Aranda]'''" (Current wiki-username '''[[Wikipedia:User:Secret|Secret]]'''; not to be confused with "The Secret", a cheesy [[hippie|New Age]] philosophy that is even more convoluted and mindless than [[Time Cube]]) is a typical [[emo]] [[Wikipedophile]] admin, he is mostly known for holding the record of the most failed RFA's (Request For Adminship) and the user who has claimed to be "leaving" the most times, and being unable to spell jackshit. He is a [[deletionist]] and a power hungry psychofuck. Although he lives in Miami, [[Florida]], he never sees the sun as he is too busy either abusing his admin powers, or resigning them in a fit of pique. After enduring a little bit of vandalism, he went uber-emo and blocked his own account, and then he attempted suicide [[IRL]]. Feeling sorry for him, his fellow [[Internets]] "[[friend]]s" convinced him to [[cum]] back to the [[Wikipedia]] [[circle jerk]]. The only reason he is still on the site is because he's an admin.<!--<small>Jorge Aranda b. August or September 9, 1988, in Miami Beach, Florida</small>--> He also failed to get a job [[IRL]] because his job interviewer determined that he was too immature due to the [[Fact|evidence]] provided by this ED article.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Secret&diff=304601082&oldid=300631687 ]

Recently, Jaranda was involuntarily committed to a nuthouse because it turns out he's a [[Schizophrenia|schizo]].[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Secret&diff=335398908&oldid=334958497 ]

Jaranda had once again left the project, this time because he got [[Butthurt|butt-hurt]] by [[Jimbo Wales|Jimbo]].

Jimbo told him to "''excuse themselves from the project and find a new hobby''".[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jaranda&diff=prev&oldid=159016804] so he made an essay called 'My leaving essay', then blocked himself.

As he has nothing better to do in his pitiful little life, he had no choice but to return to Wikipedia and continue being Jimbo's <s>bitch</s> pet, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&diff=prev&oldid=165541646 proof]. This dumb fuck lost the password to his original account, yet he says Wikipedia is a failure [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Secret&oldid=170584676]. After changing his username a few times due to [[death]] threats,[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Secret&oldid=170584676] he resulted in stealing an account called [[Wikipedia:User:Secret|Secret]][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jaranda ]

[[Image:Crying baby1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaranda's face when [[Jimbo]] told him to [[GTFO]] Wikipedia]]

He has admitted to approving Veropedia because there are fewer bullies that taunt about his physical disability which prevents him spelling [[dumbfuck|shit]].[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Jaranda_%28reconfirmation%29&diff=142389402&oldid=142387909]

Born September 9, 1988, he attended Miami Beach High School, his zip code is '''33131''', but since then has edited from Florida International University ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/131.94.55.71 he forgets to log in sometimes] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/131.94.145.132 other times], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/147.70.112.129 still does]) and is doing Political Science and Journalism, and was previously studying History. He has also edited from Miami Dade College. Since everyone agrees he is a [[faggot|failure]] of an admin, he removed himself from the recall list before he opened more [[goatse|gaping butt holes]] of other users.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Secret&diff=178380943&oldid=178378203] He is also on [[IRC]] sometimes.[http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/cgi-bin/girc.cgi?Na=Aranda] He loves baseball, yet you wouldn't think so. He is also obsessed with some dead [[Mexican]] singer called Selena Quintanilla-Pérez. He has a cousin that is learning a language at International Studies Charter High School.
[[Image:EmoCat.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]

He is a proud [[deletionist]], despite failing to properly delete [[Chris Crocker]] from TOW when given the opportunity. Adding his <strike>vote</strike> view to AFDs in under 60 seconds, a common trait between deletionists.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Pittsburgh_Galleria&diff=prev&oldid=184555736][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Crosswinds_Mall&diff=prev&oldid=184555933]. He uses many stolen scripts in his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Secret/monobook.js monobook] to automate and speed up his deletionism/afd'ing/csd'ing etc.

He is supposedly a native English speaker (though is seemingly illiterate), noob at Spanish, [[Hispanic]] heritage. Likes rap music and is probably still using [[AOL]], WTF?

*His [[AIM]] is '''Aranda1Cards'''
*The true amount of times he has claimed to have 'left' Wikipedia may never be known, but you can find a few in the Oppose section [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Jaranda Here]. That page is 2 years old, so the true amount of times is uncountable.

==His hunger for power==
Everyone knows that Jaranda only registered to become an admin-fag, he felt he should be admin only a month after he registered (see rfa timeline). He is so power hungry, he tried to be admin at the commons wiki,[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Requests_and_votes/Aranda56] then got [[pwned]] at his steward election[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stewards/elections_2007/statements/Jaranda]. He has had a grand total of '''8''', yes '''eight''' RFA's.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Jaranda_%28reconfirmation%29#Questions_for_the_candidate] Six of which [[fail|failed]]. The other two somehow passed, one at 20% oppose[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Jaranda_%28reconfirmation%29] and the other at 26% oppose[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Jaranda2]. The only logical explanation on why he became admin is [[Fellatio|being nice]] to his only '[[Bureaucratic Fuck|friends]]'. But [[srsly]], who gives a fuck if there's pages and pages of proof that this guy is too much of a dumbfuck and [[emo]] to be admin?

===RFA Timeline===
[[Image:Poop_jaranda.jpg|thumb|right|Some problems are just too stubborn to get rid of.]]
Jaranda has had 8 RFA's (a record) on Wikipedia alone, he's one of those users you know shouldn't be admin but just won't go away. Just like lumps of floating faeces that won't flush no matter how many times you attempt to flush them. He's even proud of it[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Linuxbeak/Wikimania_2006/Wikipedian_Survey&diff=53971731&oldid=53971589]. He is the only user to have had six failed RFA's consecutively for every month from October 05 -> March 06. While he was failing at getting adminship, he tried to get admin on simple wikipedia, commons, and be a steward LOL. He also holds the record for most failed OTRS volunteer attempts at 5, stubborn little fucker ain't he.

:1. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Aranda56 Oct 05], his first one, only a month after he registered

:5. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Aranda56_5 Feb 06] can't turn down a nom again.. ([[Wikipedia:User:Drini|Drini]] the dwarf nominates him)
:--- [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Administrators/Requests_and_votes/Aranda56 Febr 06 Commons] (his WikiCommons attempt, if he can't be an admin at Wiki P, why not try Wiki C? lol)
:6. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Jaranda Mar 06], his first RFA since he changed his name a bunch of times, his plan fails as everyone remembers how fucking annoying he is and fails yet again
:7. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Jaranda2 Jul 06], his first RFA for 3 long agonising months, somehow passes, even though 20% opposed
:--- [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=OTRS&diff=prev&oldid=447431 Oct 06 OTRS], his first OTRS attempt, quickly denied
:--- [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=OTRS/volunteering&oldid=548196#Jaranda Feb 07 OTRS], second OTRS attempt, again is quickly denied
:--- [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=OTRS/volunteering&oldid=653392#Jaranda_.2F_en:User:Jaranda July 07 OTRS], third OTRS attempt, denied ''again''
:8. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Jaranda_%28reconfirmation%29 July 07], tries again after his rampage and again, somehow passes with 26% users opposing.
:--- [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=OTRS/volunteering&oldid=740238#Jaranda_.2F_en:User:Secret Nov 07 OTRS], fourth OTRS attempt, denied again lol
:--- [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stewards/elections_2007/statements/Jaranda Nov 07 Steward] (His pathetic Steward attempt 3 months later)
:--- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2008/Candidate_statements/Secret Nov 08 Arbitrator], a year later and he it is obvious now he is unable to learn anything. After this article was updated and Jaranda read it, he actually learned something! He withdrew 7 days later knowing he'd just get completely [[pwned]] again. He then [[butthurt|deleted]] the discussion of what an idiot he was in a desperate anti-lulz maneuver.
:--- [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=OTRS/volunteering&oldid=1306947#Secret Nov 08 OTRS], his fifth attempt, he needs to read this article more! Quicky failed.
:--- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2009/Candidate_statements/Secret Nov 09 Arbitrator], funnily enough elections to the Arb Com started on November 10, and he started editing heavily again at the start of November. Co-incidence? Bracing for another [[epic fail]]. NEWSFLASH: He failed yet again... and like the drama queen he is, he withdrew before voting ended. Again. 
:9. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Secret Oct 10] (planned) He wants to continue to make public spectacles of himself - "''Note my RFA is going for late October, and I already got two highly trusted adminstrators who offered to co-nom. Just need one more, email me.''"
:--- ??? 10 for 2010 OTRS/Arbitrator/Commons/Steward attempt (Space Holder)

After every RFA he fails he says he's leaving, stops editing for a few days then comes back. He then adds his professional views to users RFA's like:
{{quote|[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Earthbendingmaster|you need three+ months of experience to even have a chance of passing an RFA]].|Jaranda opposing someone else's RFA. Well you know that from experience don't you Jorgey?|colour=blue|size=360%}}

So how did he become admin? Well there are many theories, here's some of the most popular ones:
*People were sick of seeing his RFA's constantly appearing on the list and just wanted it to stop.
*He bribed a [[Bureaucratic_Fuck|bureaucrat]] with either money or another RL [[fellatio|chor]].
*He's a pro at sockpuppetry, see his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Karmafist first admin nominator] that got caught, though this is unlikely as the average chimp would outsmart him
*People felt sorry for him and his meaningless little life.
*A combination of the above.

To this very day he continues to try and gain further power despite abusing his admin in the past and leaving [[over 9000]] times and being constantly denied.

{{quote|This is completely outrageous. Have they forgotten that Jaranda went out with an act of vandalism? Do they have any concerns whatsoever about a person with so little foresight and such a propensity towards overreacting? I figured he'd come back and get the tools back until I saw the vandalism; then I figured there's no way they'd be so irresponsible as to resysop him after that, but I was wrong. It's simply shameful. Jaranda used his admin tools to vandalize, and he is given the tools back on request.|Everyking}}

==Jaranda today==
Jaranda hasn't changed much since starting at Wikipedia, he occasionally adds annoying templates at the top of pages, helps delete stuff and still hangs around at the beloved RFA section, where most of his history is stored. He edits from IPs and [[lurk]]s most of the time.

He probably has at least one sock account, the first person to finds it gets a free [[internet]]s token. Until you can find it, you can find the different IP addresses he edits under.

===How he makes himself feel important===
Today, Jaranda does most of the useless drone-like stuff Wikiadmins do, like adding big, ugly boxes to the top of pages, spamming votes in AFDs and closing high profile discussions even though he isn't mentally capable of making these decisions (or any decisions for that matter). However,  Jaranda needs to give himself [[Unwarranted Self-Importance]]. Closing high profile discussions about stuff being deleted is one of Jaranda's favourite hobbies. He will occasionally try and close them as soon as possible to stop any other user from doing it before him. List of high profile XFDs he has closed:
#(350+ edits)[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Secret_pages|Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Secret_pages]] (he even left it fully protected this time, what a dumbass)
#(350+ edits)[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Susan_Boyle&oldid=283776027 tried to close] [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Susan Boyle|Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Susan Boyle]] but was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Susan_Boyle&oldid=283788752 denied]. Decided within 3 minutes[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Susan_Boyle&diff=prev&oldid=283775633][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Susan_Boyle&diff=prev&oldid=283776027] He wasn't even an admin when he did this.
#(300+ edits)[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits (second nomination)|Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits (second nomination)]] decided within 5 minutes[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Doc_glasgow&diff=prev&oldid=166396980][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits_(second_nomination)&diff=prev&oldid=166398066]
#(150+ edits)[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ESStonia|Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ESStonia]]
#(100+ edits)[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/24 Hour Propane People|Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/24 Hour Propane People]] decided within 3 minutes[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Matrix&diff=prev&oldid=187772260][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/24_Hour_Propane_People&diff=prev&oldid=187773020] and too lazy to remove afd tags
So what can you do about this? Simple, just disagree with him and prove him wrong. Not only does he rush to close them as fast as he can, he also [[fail]]s at english, so rarely bothers to read the discussion and just counts the votes instead.

==Jaranda's return, Arbitration and OTRS attempt==
In November 2008, Jaranda started editing heavily again. He couldn't bare editing from an IP anymore as he can't boss people around as admin, or delete stuff. He also probably rejoined at this time to try and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2008/Candidate_statements/Secret join the arb committee], as it only happens once a year. He also [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=OTRS/volunteering&diff=prev&oldid=1286549 tried to be an OTRS] volunteer. Because everyone knows he's only still just here just for the power, when was the last time he actually wrote a decent article? Lets find out...

{{quote|I went on wikibreak for a while because of harassment from ED}}

The following question came up:
:# Please select and describe what you consider to be your five "best" contributions to Wikipedia.
::#My three featured articles [[wikipedia:History of Miami, Florida|History of Miami, Florida]] '''([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/History_of_Miami,_Florida FA'd in January 2006]'''), [[Wikipedia:Selena|Selena]] ('''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Selena Made to FA in July 2006 lol two years ago]''') and [[wikipedia:Bob Meusel|Bob Meusel]] ('''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Bob_Meusel FA'd in  September 2007)'''], one of my good articles [[wikipedia:Ryan Leaf|Ryan Leaf]] ('''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ryan_Leaf&diff=71315816&oldid=69115111 became GA in August 2006)'''] also another thing I'm proud of is helping reform AFD from being a broken vote count back in 2005 to 2006 to the current consensus process it is today. [[Wikipedia:User:Secret|Secret]] <sup>[[Wikipedia:User talk:Secret|account]]</sup> 20:18, 18 November 2008 (UTC)

The dates were added by ED, as you can see he hasn't written anything useful in [[over 9000]] edits, if he answered honestly, it would've gone something like this:

:# Please select and describe what you consider to be your five "best" contributions to Wikipedia.
::#In the over the three years I've been here, I've made three featured articles [[wikipedia:History of Miami, Florida|History of Miami, Florida]] [[Wikipedia:Selena|Selena]] and [[wikipedia:Bob Meusel|Bob Meusel]] one of my good articles [[wikipedia:Ryan Leaf|Ryan Leaf]]. I wrote all of these in 2006/2007, since then I haven't written anything useful, just delete stuff. Also another thing I'm proud of is helping reform AFD from being a broken vote count back in 2005 to 2006 to the current consensus process it is today, but this has nothing to do with writing articles, but as I'm a proud deletionist I see it is a contribution. [[Wikipedia:User:Secret|Secret]] <sup>[[Wikipedia:User talk:Secret|account]]</sup> 20:18, 18 November 2008 (UTC)

Most users actually think he's only doing it for the [[lulz]], because deleting stuff is boring on its own. Pissing around, wasting more time, users time and being an [[attention whore]] is much more fun. Soon after reading the above, he [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2008/Candidate_statements&diff=prev&oldid=254031625 withdrew] after realising he is only making a complete idiot of himself. ED knows other users better than they know themselves.

==How will it end?==
[[Image:Moreselfpwnagepls.gif|frame|Just become [[an hero]] already, nobody will miss you.]]
As Jaranda gets [[butthurt]] so easily, it's only a matter of time before someone hurts his [[emo|feelings]] again. He will then block himself, create another emo-essay and return again at a later date. This process will continue until he finds out how much of a [[An hero|failure he is]]. Sadly, as he is such a dumb fuck, he has yet failed in becoming [[an hero]], because he doesn't know [[How to become an hero|how to become one]]!.

The only thing that is likely to make him leave [[TOW]] is losing his admin, as that's the only reason he's there to begin with. Then he'll just make another account, delete shit again then become admin.

==Final Mental Breakdown==
<center>[[Image:Jarandafat2.gif]][[Image:Jarandafat2.gif]][[Image:Jarandafat2.gif]][[Image:Jarandafat2.gif]]</center>
[[Last Thursday]], Jaranda gave his user name and password of his [[Wikipedia:User:Secret|User:Secret]] account on Wikipedia to his [[brother]] who posted on the user page that he went [[insane|looney tunes]] and was put into a padded room. The [[Bureaucratic fuck]]s at Wikipedia performed an [[circumcision|emergency de-sysop]] on his account. We hope that Jaranda enjoys IRL insanity moar than he enjoyed being an insane wikipedo admin.
{{quote|Note I used to let my cousin use my account for homework related purposes. He rarely edited and never used the buttons while I was a adminstrator. I have a [[insane|schizoaffective]] disorder I inherited from my mother, my symptoms started when I was 19, and I had a full nervous breakdown seven months ago.}}{{quote|Sorry for [[I did it for the lulz|all the damage I have done]] in the project for the past few years, and I need your forgiveness.}}
