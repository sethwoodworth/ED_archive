'''Weev: Still Here''' is the working title of the forthcoming biopic about the life and times of notorious [[anti-Zionist]] hacker and [[god|holy roller]], [[Andrew Weevlos]] of [[Goatse Security]] fame that will star '''Joaquin Phoenix''' in the title role.

On 9/11/2010, Joaquin's management agency issued a press release revealing that Joaquin had come to his senses after a tumultuous two years in which he quit acting and had been picked to play the title role in a major motion picture about notorious [[h4x0r]], troll and human rights activist [[Weev]]. Directed by [[Disney|Ron Howard]], "Weev: Still Here" will premiere in theatres on 9/11/2011. 

Mr. Phoenix issued a short statement of his own in which he thanked Ron Howard for the role of a lifetime.

==Weev's Story==
[[File:Weev.png|thumb|left|Weev Guevara]]
''See main article at [[Weev]]''.

'''Weev''' aka '''The Honourable Andrew WK Weevlos''' is a [[Chaotic Neutral|grey hat]] hacking legend from [[Bantown]] Arkansas who ran afoul of the law in mid [[2010]] when he exposed [[goatse|gaping security holes]] in [[Mac|Apple Computers]]' new toy, the [[iPad]], and embarrassed [[Steve Jobs]] by revealing [[over 9000]] private email addresses of [[The Man|high profile customers]]. Seeing as [[Steve Jobs]] is all about [[SFB|serious fucking business]] when it comes to Apple's proprietary technology he naturally sic'd Apple's [[KGB|Jack-booted thugs]] on Mr. Weevlos who -along with Arkansas' [[Party Van|long arm of the law]]- arrested him following an [[IRL]] [[SWATing]] shortly after Mr. Weevlos [http://www.geek.com/articles/apple/hacker-in-att-ipad-case-breaks-gagging-order-2010078/ went public with the security flaw] (after first alerting Apple and AT&T). 

Despite an ongoing investigation by the [[FBI]] there is no real case against Weev so the cops planted drugs all over his [[basement|apartment]] and [[v&]] him, as well as seizing all of his computers (ironically, Macs). Whilst Mr. Weevlos is prescribed [[pot|medical marijuana]] for cataracts, he denies having tried any of the other drugs supposedly found in the police raid and is actually vehemently opposed to drug use of any kind.

He is currently facing [[SFB|four felony drug possession charges]] and several [[lolsuit|misdemeanours]] for pissing off Steve Jobs. Jobs has seen to it that one of Arkansas' top criminal prosecutors, John Threet, is representing [[The Man|the people]]. It should be noted that Mr. Threet usually only handles murder cases. Despite being a judge himself, Mr. Weevlos will be represented by the legal team of Johnnie Cochran and [[BLACK_MAN|Clive Blackman]] PhD. 

===Legal Team===

Johnnie Cochran's [[OJ Simpson|record speaks for itself]]. Meanwhile, Mr. Blackman is a 44-year-old black man with an IQ that qualifies him for [[God Tier]] at MENSA. At 18-years-old he was accepted to Yale University on an academic scholarship and went on to become a two-time All American noseguard and a raw powerlifting champion. After graduating summa cum laude he went on to a successful career making a small fortune in rural real estate that enabled him to retire at age 30. Mr. Blackman ist 6'4 and weighs in at 267lbs with 12% body fat. His penis is 8.8 inches in length and is [[Not a Jew|uncircumcised]] -a crucial factor for his retention by Mr. Weevlos.

==Joaquin Phoenix==

[[File:Weev_beardy_250x375.jpg|thumb|[[Diddy]].]]
'''Joaquin Leaf Phoenix''' is an Oscar© omnomnominated Puerto Rican [[wigger]], and male model whose parents were Hollywood hippies that joined a [[Heaven's Gate|cult]] and gave all their children ridiculous [[hippie]] names like River, Summer, Rain, Leaf and Ethanol. After a brief but mediocre career as an actor, following in the footsteps of his more talented but dead older brother, River, Joaquin became a [[vegan]], joined [[PETA]], took acid, tuned on, tuned in, dropped out, grew a beard and created a lot of [[YHBT|drama]].

From 2008 through 2010 his behaviour got increasingly more 'wacky', and Marlon Brando-esque. He was reportedly perpetually drunk, put on a [[fatty|shitload of weight]], started consuming mass quantities of [[hookers and blow]] and generally appeared to be having a [[batshit crazy|meltdown]]. In 2009, Joaquin announced that he was quitting acting to pursue a career in rap music -as a rapper. He subsequently hit up [[Diddy|P. Diddy]] to be his producer and Diddy said he'd do it but only if Joaquin gave him a bunch of money. However, upon hearing JP's demo, he changed his mind.

During a [[trolling IRL|bizarre appearance]] on the David Letterman show, he complained that nobody was taking him seriously and that this was not a [[attention whore|publicity stunt]].
