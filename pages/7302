Scott Pilgrim vs the World
{{needsmoar|ex girlfriends, boyfriends, and spank fodder}}
'''Scott Pilgrim Vs the World''' (a.k.a., [[No More Heroes|No More Heroes]] minus [[Awesome|swearing, sex, and gore]]) is a horrible [[nerd|comic book]] and movie about a 12 year old boy who can't get a boner over anything but [[shit nobody cares about|The Pixies]] and some girl on [[lollerskates]]. It is most famous for being an [[anime]] about [[Canadia]] and [[vegan]] faggotry, but also for it's numerous references to [http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/ stuff white people like]. As of [[last Thursday]] there are many fans bawwing about the movie actually losing money.

===Scat Pligrim===

[[Michael Cera|Michael Sarah]] plays a dysfunctional [[retard]] in a movie [http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=scottpilgrim.htm nobody watched]. His responsibilities include playing in a band, [[blowjob|free loading]] off his gay room mate, and defeating some girl's ex boyfriends for their pocket change. It's rumored that he will be portrayed as a deadbeat good for nothing collecting welfare checks in the sequel.

Except there will be no sequel because [[do not want|nobody loves]] Michael Cera, not even [[you]].

===Ramona Flowers===
Ramona [[slut|deFlowerd]] is a cum dumpster with at least seven jealous ex boyfriends. She went to [[Canada|Toronto]] from a place [[New York City|you've never even heard of]] to get a shitty job as a courier. She rides around on roller skates and is too cool to talk to the [[you|drunk assholes]] at parties. It's not really clear what she does in this film, other than serve her hole for filling.

===Knives (that azn chick)===
The mandatory [[azn]] [[loli]] of the film, Knives is a virgin afraid of kissing Scott, because he is obviously a pedophile. Her talents include DDR and looking angry at people. She calls herself a Scat-aholic

===The Band (Sex Bomb-Omb)===
Some guy who doesnt give a shit and Scott's ex girlfriend play in a band, known for ripping off garage rock from the past one hundred years. Scott's annoying ex girlfriend prefers to scorn and shoot herself in the head, while introducing her band at every show by shouting and clicking her drum sticks. The characters in the band are mostly fodder.

===Ramona's Seven Ex's===
The reason Ramona's so fucked up and also the reason to watch this movie. They punch Scott Pilgrim in the face a lot of times, but ultimately get defeated by his boyish good looks. Each burst into coins when they are defeated, but they're [[Canada|Canadian]] coins so no one really cares.

[[Emo|Matthew Patel]]: Ramona's first evil-ex boyfriend. Ramona broke up with him after he gave her too much chiken and watermellonz. Oh wait, he's Indian. [[Blackface|With raccoon eyes]]. Whatever, he gets punched and turns into like 20 cents due to outsourced Indian labor.

[[George Lucas|Lucas Lee]]: Ramona's second evil-ex boyfriend. Gets tricked into becoming [[an hero]].

[[Vegetarian|Todd Ingram]]: Ramona's third evil-ex boyfriend. A (cheating) vegan who gets psychic powers. Gets shot by the Punisher and promptly headbutted.

[[Lesbian|Roxy Richter]]: Ramona's fourth evil-ex and her only [[bisexual|girlfriend]]. Orgasms to death.

[[Japan|Kyle and Ken Katayanagi]]: Ramona's fifth and sixth evil-exes, respectively. Fight Scott's band and are destroyed by a holographic Yeti.

[[Tom Cruise|Gideon Gordon "G-Man" Graves]]: Ramona's seventh and final evil-ex boyfriend. Scott fights him in a fight completely ripped from "No More Heroes". He dies and everyone lived happily ever after.

==Scott Pilgrim vs the Comic Book==

[[File:Knives34.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Knives, about to get [[pedobear|statutorily raped]]]]
The comic is basically the same as the film, only people actually collect and like them. The author made an entire new book for every seventh of the film though, which means you actually need to buy every edition to see [[RL|the big picture]]

<center>'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Tell owners of the comic that the movie was better.</center>

==Scott Pilgrim vs the [[Vidya]]==

In the tradition of River City, Final Fight, and other side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, [[French]]-[[Canadian]] butthole-lickers Ubisoft released an 8-bit side-scrolling game based on the comic series and movie. For [[SA|10bux]], you could play a game that was essentially better than anything else Ubisoft has ever released for 4-5 times that price, while getting to [[Lonely|feel like you're ''playing'' the comic you just fapped over]]. Some of the exciting elements to this game included:

*Watching big-headed, big-tittied 8-bit sluts bobbing their racks as you beat the shit out of people/things, or buy from their stores/restaurants.
*[[Chiptune]] music made especially for this game. Which, of course, doesn't sound like any other games' Chiptune music(s), being [[Sarcasm|there's only so many random ways you can make 8-bit soundtracks and all]].
*Getting to wreck [[Hipster|Hipsters]], [[Guido|Guidos]], and the occasional [[Scenefag]] or [[Punk]] on the mean streets of [[Canada|Toronto]] and/or at concerts.
*Going to a movie set and a Halloween party where you fight [[Samefag|the same monsters!]]
*Zombies and Robots. [[Srsly]].
*4-way Multiplayer! Which, considering there is no online multiplayer on this, means you're going to have to somehow find 4 people who don't mind the smell of stale Cheetos and Jenkem in your [[Basement]] if you [[No Friends|want to get the full experience]].

==Scott Pilgrim vs the Internet==

Despite putting ads all over the internet, Scott Pilgrim couldn't bring enough [[13 year old boys]] to the show. This has created some [[serious business|tension]] between fans and their [[Butthurt|sense of justice]]. Commonly cited examples of why this movie is good include [[everyone|other peoples]] reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] or IMDB.

==Scott Pilgrim vs a Troll==
*Call Ramona Flowers a [[cumdumpster]]
*Claim Scott only fought those guys because [[fact|he's broke]]
*Remind fans that despite his [[indie|taste]] in [[music]], Scott is a creep, a pedophile, and unemployed ([[truth|JUST LIKE THEM!]])
*List every name dropped from the movie and comic's deliberate pandering to a specific demographic
*Claim the film was better than the comic, but still over rated
*Mention Michael Cera sucking as an actor and person.
*Tell them Ramona's a shemale and Scott's only dating her cause he's secretly gay
*Go on DeviantArt or Scottpilgrim.ning.com and point out the creators shortcomings.
