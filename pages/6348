Perfect
{{perfect}}

[[Everyone]] wants to be perfect, but nobody really is perfect. Since everyone on the [[internets]] is delusional, they think they really are perfect and [[ass]]ume everyone else wants to hear about them. This leads them to create [[shitty]] entries on [[stupid]] websites such as [[LiveJournal]], which can be a source of [[drama]] and lulz when someone reveals (and shatters their perfect illusion) that they are less than perfect.

==Perfect Ass==
Donkeys will one day rule the earth, mark my words. 

==Perfect world==
The perfect world consist of hamsters who control teh world with humans as pets!!!! IT WILL!!!!!!!!!!!!

But right now, it's an [[MMORPG]] based on how long you can last waiting for a minute between 15-second action sequences over and over again while listening to [[shit]] [[weeaboo]] music.

==Perfect Articles==
Some articles are so perfect that editing them in any way will make them less [[lulz]]y and will make you a fucking [[lolcow]].
