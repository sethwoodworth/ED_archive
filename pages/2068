Database Error

[[Image:Ed_database_error.png|left|thumb|Shit happens]]
A database error, not unlike those resulting from a [[DDoS]], serves a purpose much like severing a group of ants from contact with the rest of the colony. One minute everything is fine and the next its pure fucking pandemonium. If a site like [[livejournal]] or [[twitter]] is down for more than a few minutes it will receive more attention than if it were the stock market tanking, and you can rest assured that [[slashdot]], [[digg]], and [[reddit]] will start blogging about the apocalypse, unless they're down too, in which case [[lol|ur fuckd]].
