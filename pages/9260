{{youtube2|Yokedtojesus|Yokeup}} is a notoriously homophobic,shit-for-brains, delusional [[christfag]] [[fucktard]], who spends his time beating the devil out of his closeted [[lesbian]] wife, telling [[atheists]] and gays that they don't exist, and making evangelical YouTube videos. Whilst Yokeup's existence is for the most part, utterly meaningless, he does raise important questions, such as; how does he manage to use a mouse without thumbs; and how can an orangutan operate a computer? These questions could probably be answered by scientists, but he doesn't believe in science, so his one meaningful quality will go to waste. When not beating the gay out of his wife or lynching atheists, Yokeup likes to excrete hate-mongering videos on YouTube, notable for their prelude of [[lies|"this is not hate speech"]] somewhat similar to prefacing obvious copypasta with [[copypasta|"this is not copypasta."]]

=='''Initial Appearance'''==
[[image:Very_christlike.png|thumb|right|250px|Because we all know Jesus would have [[gun|packed heat]].]]
While you may initially mistake Yokeup for your typical run-of-the-mill lovable [[Redneck|southern bumpkin]] [[Christian]], it doesn't take long to recognize him for the mentally disturbed, fundie, homophobic, sexist, racist, right-wing, queer beating, young earth creationist [[douchebag]] that he really is. Yokeup's species is however, slightly more difficult to discern, as he has the sloping brow of the ''Homo habilis'' species, the chin length and mental capacity of the earlier ''Pierolapithecus catalaunicus'' family, and the common courtesy of a starving, rabid Hyena on PCP.

He is also a [[fat]] piece of shit.<BR>
So, he's what [[Brett Keane]] would be if he was raised by the cast of Deliverance.

==='''Wife'''===
[[image:Blatant_lesbian.jpg|thumb|right|Totally not a lesbian]]Yokeups faithful punching bag, Caroline, appears in pretty much all of Yokeup's videos, but mostly as decoration or to blindly affirm something that Yokeup said. Although she clearly breaks the no [[women]] on the [[internets]] rule, she is excused as her master and lord Yokeup makes sure she doesn't say anything [[stupid]] by monitoring all her videos. Yeah, women are like that, got to keep them on a short leash. According to Caroline, [[bullshit|she was a lesbian for 15 years, then got saved through the love of Jesus.]] The [[truth]], however, is that women got tired of her old and worn out body, so she was forced to turn to Yokeup for sexual stimulation. Currently her life on YouTube revolves around trying to convince "bellathehappyloser" that she is neither an atheist, nor a lesbian, while trying to hide her deep lesbian love affair with Xild.

'''UPDATE: Caroline has since given up on bellathehappyloser and has since taken to incoherent textual comments, video faggotry, and camwhoring for Christ.'''

===='''Music'''====
[[Image:YokedUP cdCover-342x263.png|thumb|right|Oh exploitable]]As well as her full time job as an atheist lyncher and gay beater, she also enjoys making corny christian country music. Her songs are filled with lyrics regarding American military superiority and always feature generic background music. Fun fact, she even sings like a lesbian.

=='''On-line Drama'''==
==='''Videos'''===
Yokeups first challenge to atheists consisted of telling them that he would say "[[God]] bless [[You|you]]" to a stranger, if they said "[[fuck]]" you to a stranger. Nobody had any idea what he meant by that, and he was promptly [[pwnt]] by Nick Gisburne. His second challenge consisted of challenging [[TheAmazingAtheist]] to a wrestling match. Normally a challenge this blatantly homosexual would be taken up by TheAmazingAtheist in a flash, but due to various laws prohibiting zoophilia he was forced to pull out. Yokeups most [[retarded|recent]] challenge to atheists involved asking atheists to prove that they exist. Over [[9000]]  YouTube atheists took up and defeated the challenge, by merely showing up on camera.

==='''Yokeup's Fast'''===

[[Last Thursday]], Yokeup announced that he would go on a 40 day fast for [[Jesus]] and he challenged YouTube atheists to do the same. Yokeup claimed that only a true Christian would be able to survive for 40 days without food as only they can live off the [[Semen|spirit]] of Jesus...and soup and “[[food|protein drinks]]”. Yokeup got pissed off when a load of atheists accepted his challenge. Yokeup personally dropped by their channels to tell them that they were [[evil|darksided]] and would [[fail]] due to negative [[Scientology|thetans]] or something. During the fast, it was noted with curiosity that Yokeup seemed to be gaining weight, which would make him the only person in the world who can get fatter whilst not eating. Rather than address these accusations, Yokeup decided to continue the fast, step up the comment [[trolling]] of YouTube atheists and gain [[moar]] weight. After the [[eating|"fast"]] finished, he celebrated by going out to breakfast and eating a shitload of [[food]]. But waitaminute, if you haven’t been eating solid food for even 20 days, eating is the painful equivalent of giving birth. This means either Yokeup is a [[fucking]] liar and a typical [[christfag]] [[hypocrite]], or that he consumed so much [[food|soup and protein drinks]] that [[Eating|what he did]] could hardly be considered a fast.

==='''Debate with a Muslim'''===
Yokeup stepped way out of his biological depth when he agreed to participate in a religious debate with an [[Islam|Islamic]] ''Homo Sapiens'' called Tangier9. This was Yoekup's failed attempt to save face after [[internet tough guy|TommyfromthefuckingfuckingBronx]] asserted that Yokeup was too [[pussy]] to debate a [[Muslim]]. Turns out Yokeup brain is smaller than his penis, seeing how he instantly lost debate by admitting under no pressure, that he was utterly wrong, and forfeited the debate without even realizing what he had done it. The subject of the debate was "Does salvation through [[Christ]] make sense" And right off the bat Yokeup said, "Salvation through Christ makes no sense." He didn't realize the mistake, and continued "debating" obliviously, and wondered why everyone kept laughing at him. Christians all over YouTube facepalmed, and filthy Mujahadeen insurgents who hate our freedom rejoiced. Even without this monumental cock-up (his ass), Yokeup still got slaughtered. He was replying to all of Tangier's pwnage with "loldunno, im just a truck driver that loves jesus, hyuck hyuck hyuck."<br>
