Internet Rehab
'''Internet Rehab''' is a dark place filled with internet legends who have [[Quitting IRC forever|quit the internets forever]]. However, Internet Rehab cannot be confused with Quitting The Internet forever, just like real rehab all the patients know and expect they will relapse and return to the internet sooner rather than later.

Understanding why a user decides to stop championing the [[lulz]] is the first step in recovery. However, once the user realizes how fun the lulz are he essentially [[fail|falls off the wagon of rehab into the fiery depths of lol]], thereby creating a [[Roflcopter|vicious cycle]]. Proving the age old proverb by [[user:Riboflavin | Chinky McChink]]



{{Quote|Lulz graze in green forest
dine gracefully

green pastures

of lol|[[user:Riboflavin |Chinky McChink]] At Least 100 years ago - refering to lol}} 

to be not only a bad haiku, but also true.

Unlike real rehab, Internet Rehab isn't located in [[California]]. Instead, it is located in the user's [[penis|heart]].
