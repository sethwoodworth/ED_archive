{{needsmore|Eyewitness Accounts}}

A '''UFO''' is what [[White guilt|guilty]], [[racist]] [[rednecks]] blame for their [[Heaven's Gate|sudden disappearances]], when they were actually [[murder|burying]] a stupid [[nigra]] they picked up from a [[KFC]]. Subsequently, like minded people congregate together to exchange stories. Many [[lulz]] ensue.

==Types of aliens==
[[Image:Historychannel.png|right|300px| History Made Everyday]]
===The grays===
In condcut, [[Gays|grays]] are to humans as people in general are to ants - they either [[Shit nobody cares about|don't give a shit]] or [[IDIFTL|mess around with them from time to time]]. Theoretically, it is difficult to say they are [[teh]] ebil as most humans aren't vegetarians. They are characterized by having underdeveloped digestive and reproductive organs, and visit earth to get better ones, generally from cows. This explains the phenomena of dead cows found with a perfect 'circle rash' on their ventral surfaces, autopsies revealing missing organs.
===These other kinds who meet up===
These aliens congregate from all over the universe who, as [[Galactic Federation of Light|spiritually higher beings]], congregate(d) to [[Moralfag|help mankind]] (see Theory #1).

==Theories==
===Theory #1===
Accepts idea of grays, and believes that other types of aliens who are [[I Don't Watch TV|spiritually superior]] to humans congregate and contact certain human beings to save the world, although accounts have fallen significantly since the 70s. When they contact a human or humans, generally they ask whether the person will accept a small type of mission that will take an hour or more a day to accomplish, including the writing of a book dictated by the aliens signed under a pseudonym or the person's own name. The world along with the rest of the Milky Way, and perhaps other galaxies, are slowly moving towards an area in space with 'higher vibrations'. People have similar vibrations, known as an aura, and the earth functions in a similar way, with its own version of chakras or 'levels of energy' (core, less lava-y levels, etc). The earth is suspected to not be able to withstand this energy and will [[OH SHI-|shatter]] once it comes in contact with these higher vibrations. The problem is not death, as these aliens are well aware of the spiritual planes one moves up after death; rather, the problem is that energy (also known as souls) will have nowhere to congregate in palpable form to carry out spiritual needs exigencies . As of late, UFO have not been contacting humans, puzzling us on the progress of the state of the world.


===Theory #2===
[[File:Nazi-ufo.jpg|thumb|rut roh]]
Says that Theory #1 is complete [[bullshit]], and that there are no space aliens at all. It claims that all recent sightings of UFOs are actually the work of [[Nazi]] super-science. Once commissioned by [[Hitler]] under the "Wunderwaffen" program, these vehicles are now supposedly in the possession of the US government, with a few still in the hands of Nazi scientists who were given refuge in [[South America]].
