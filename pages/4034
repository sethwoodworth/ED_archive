'''Insanity''' is a form of [[retard|retardation]] which presents itself in many [[lulz]]y ways. Rather, we're talking about the [[wambulance|clinically depressed]] or the [[schizophrenic]]. If there's a nut-job around, get ready for some laughs.

It is not known with certainty what the causes of insanity are, but it's probably a safe bet that it has something to do with [[white trash]] whores smoking meth while they had rotting little [[you|shit-bags]] festering in their guts.  

[[On the Internet]]s about 100% of the people are insane.  This is most likely due to online communities, fetish porn, and the fact that insane people can't hold [[unemployed|jobs]] so they have nothing better to do than waste their time [[OL]].

==Insanity As Common Usage==
[[File:Gary-busey-insane.jpg|thumb|right|Gary Busey, king of the insane.]]
"Insane", as it is normally used on both the [[Internets]] and [[IRL]], is a general, typically harmless and nonspecific irregularity of thought or perception. It usually refers to lower level [[leftard]]s, generic [[Christian]]s and members of various [[fandom]]s.

''':Prima:''' I think that people should be given free health care.

''':Secunda:''' You're insane!

==Insanity As A Condition==
===[[Global Warming|"The Sky is Falling!" Insanity]]===
[[At least 100 years ago|Ever since the Bible was written]], some people (most notably everybody from [[United States|America]]) have thought that it was correct. If you read the Bible from the beginning, you see this is how it all pans out:

[[Image:Insanity_diagram.png|450px|center]]

By being incredibly boring, a person can become susceptible to the eschatology and apocalyptic sections of the Bible. Getting hung up on these sections, one starts to lose touch with reality and begins believing that these verses are real.

Thus, people started suffering from "The Sky is Falling!" insanity, which causes them to attempt to [[convert]] everybody to their [[religion]].

''':Prima:''' If you don't eat Jesus' flesh or drink his blood, you're going to burn in [[Hell]]. Jesus is coming! Jesus is coming! [[Cthulhu]] cannot save you!!!

''':Secunda:''' [[O rly]]?

===[[Al Gore|"I Own the Internets!" Insanity]]===

[[Image:Mexican tinfoil.jpg|thumb|[[Mexican]] wearing a tinfoil sombrero.]]
[[Image:vampire_don_henrie.jpg|thumb|even [[God]] likes to fuck up [[jews]].]]
[[Image:M_85a979b0701e46deba48c0be9589898b.jpg]]This kid both has [[Jeffrey Dahmer|Necrophilia]] and [[Cake farts|Eproctophilia]], [[LOL WUT|awesome combo]].



Usually suffered by [[LJ]] [[moderator|mods]] who realize they can [[ban set|ban]] anybody at will, the "I Own the Internets!" Insanity is the largest cause of migration between communities.

''':Prima:''' You're not allowed to post this [[comments|comment]] against me here. I'm the mod! I can ban you!

''':Secunda:''' Go ahead. I wasn't planning on coming back anyway, you fucking nut.
:<font color=red>'''(USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST)'''</font>

===Batshit Crazy===
Batshit crazy is one of the highest levels of insanity. It's usually a combination of all of the above, to wit:

''':Prima:''' Repent of your sins! [[Frienditto]] is the Antichrist! If you don't repent I will ban you from my community! 

''':Secunda:''' You're insane!

''':Prima:''' That's [[defamation]] of character! I have [[Unlimited_disposable_income|unlimited disposable income]] and will bring you to [[Internet court]]! [[Mediacrat|I will have your humility]]! 

Not to be confused with [[Dick Cheney|Apeshit crazy]].

For a reference into batshit insanity, one should look no further than [[KurtBatz]], who, in addition to being batshit insane, [[furry|actually believes he is a bat]].

=== Hidden Internet Crazy ===
Taking place on the fringes of the known Internets and inaccessible to the casual user, Hidden Internet Crazy can be considered an [[OL]] [[Easter Egg]]. HIC consists entirely of a Prima who maintains and updates a generally non-interactive website, which invariably stuns and bewilders anybody coming into contact with it. Discovery of HIC results either in a [[meme]] which spreads hilarity, or a [[heavy unexplained bleeding|jarring illness]] as the last vestiges of one's belief in humanity's sentience leaks out of one's eyes.

HIC sites will ''always'' be coded badly because HICs cannot type whilst wearing tinfoil hats (see below) and because they love [[font size=5]]. Examples include:

===SPACE MADNESS===
Sometimes, a special combination of cosmic rays, [[GRIDS]], and [[dongs]] can lead to a whole other sort of crazy altogether. This type of crazy, named after its first victim, astronaut [[Lisa Nowak]] runs rampant through NASA, spreading faster than [[herpes]] in a [[gay]] bar, or [[AIDS]] in a pool. The two most common symptoms of SPACE MADNESS are sudden incontinence and psychotic delusions of "That [[bitch]] is stealin' mah man!!1"

===Tinfoil Hats===
[[Image:Tinfoilhatmodel.jpg|thumb|[[Pirat ponton]] models the latest in designer aluminumwear.]] 

Tinfoil Hats are the new [[Black]] (and make excellent replacements for jock-straps). The head wear of choice for [[conspiracy]] nuts like [[azad slide]] and [[puremisery]]. They keep the sunlight, UV rays, bird poop and evil alien mind control rays out out your head so you can continue to go throughout your day with the confidence of knowing all of your thoughts about the world and the [[Big Brother|government]] are completely unread and unaltered. 

You cannot actually make tinfoil hats. The ones that actually keep out all the alien mind control rays are manufactured by some guy out in Tucson who has perfected the process. I lost that guy's number.

If [[User:ParkingStones|you]] are said to be wearing a tinfoil hat, that means that you are thinking on such a high level of rational thought that other more susceptible minds cannot fathom why you are thinking the way that you do. So, go get a tinfoil hat and wear it with pride! (You wouldn't BELIEVE how much they [[money|paid]] me to say this!)

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_foil_hat Wikipedia article soon to be closed due to vandals and bona fide paranoiacs.]

As proven by the TV show Futurama's movie, ''Into The Wild Green Yonder'', tinfoil hats also prevent people from reading your mind and you from reading others's minds.

====The Tinfoil Song====
:''I've got my tinfoil hat on, hip hip hip hooray, my tinfoil hat will shield me from your mind controlling ray.''

===[[Fursuit]]s===
OK, this isn't so much being insane as it is being an annoying prick, but hey, insane people wear this too because they really think they're [[furries|animals]] or [[otherkin]] or some other bullshit like that.

===Stockholm syndrome===
Stockholm syndrome is where someone sympathizes and thinks highly of their abuser(s).  This is when people are kidnapped by terrorists and eventually they join the terrorists' group willingly.  Or people abused by their boyfriend, say they deserved it.

While Stockholm syndrome used to apply to [[IRL]] things, it in fact originated [[OTI]].

As an example: Let's say, purely hypothetically, [[USA|your country]] is hijacked like an airplane by [[W|The World's #1 terrorist]].  This terrorist controls the media and also every press conference and town hall meeting the guy attends is filled with nothing but actors praising him.  Anyone who criticizes him or exposes [[JEWS DID WTC|his crimes]] gets angry mobs insulting them and then gets secretly kidnapped and thrown in a secret prison where they're tortured until they die.  And as a result of the mistreatment, censorship, and disinformation, many people of that country begin to support him.

That purely hypothetical example is how a lot of Internet [[forum]]s are run.  [[Kimmo Alm]] runs his forum excessively this way.  Kimmo lives in Stockholm, Sweden, and the psychological condition itself was named after his city.  It was not called Kimmo or Alm syndrome because he, himself, did not have the syndrome, rather he caused others to have it.

==="I'm completely sane" Insanity===
This is a common condition suffered by most of humanity: They constantly and incurably hallucinate that they are completely sane. Symptoms of this kind of insanity include breathing, claiming that you are completely sane, thinking that this this kind of insanity is [[bullshit]], and holding any sort of opinion that uses the words "normal" or "think," two things that don't exist for most of humanity.
