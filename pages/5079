No! She was so cute before! Just have some hair and make-up professionals prep her for the shoots... '''she didn't have to erase her old self'''. She IS white now.

Omega- I really like the bottle cap pic. I like how the cap has the same shimmers as whatever it's sitting on. I like the angle of the stamp picture, and it's cool how you make the pen look kind of scary.

As I've said before, I'm not a very good photographer. But, I'm so hooked on these Japanese photo books with '''pictures of females that just mesmerize me''', and I've become kind of '''obsessed with the photos''' and how they're created. (My father's been a professional photographer, editor, camera man and news man, so that aspect is somewhat a hereditary interest.)

Anyway, as a result of my obsession, I've tried to teach myself hair and make-up, and am working on '''learning how to pose''' and aim a camera, and lighting and whatnot. My dream would be to be '''involved in photo-shoots''' someday as a make-up artist maybe.


These are mostly '''taken around my house and Housetek's''', so please don't look at the messy rooms and whatnot. The '''backgrounds aren't part of my pics, just the main subject''', as what I do is try to '''make myself look different ages and have different images''', etc. Most are very low quality, because '''all I have is a webcam''', but a couple from when '''I was at Housetek's house were taken with his digital camera'''. Sorry about the long post...

I guess if she lives in the city, it's not such a strange sight.

But... Where I live, if she were to walk down the street in that, she'd be the '''laughing stock of the town'''.

Haha, I agree. If it was just a little suggestive, that would be one thing... I guess the photographer was counting on '''men to be easily manipulated'''. I wouldn't necessarily '''call the girl stupid''', but the target audience. "Gee, let's just drip some milky white substance from her mouth to her crotch, and all over the boobs... only the really sharp ones will pick up on this innuendo.":wacko:

Why doesn't she just '''write "SKANK" across her forehead'''?

She seems like she'd be very pretty if she '''kept herself natural'''... but she bleaches her hair, tans her skin to hell, wears cheap, slutty clothes, fakes blue eyes in some of the pics, and you could draw a picture on her face with a toothpick, that make-up is so thick, but keep the toothpick away from her boobs. You don't want to pop them.

'''I wish she felt truly pretty so she wouldn't have to disguise herself''', manipulate herself through surgery, and cheapen herself in a hundred other ways.

{{squote|:shocked: Holy hooters!

She's cuter than the average Japanese girl off the street, but not than other Japanese models.

The sad thing for this girl is that '''she'll probably end up doing porn''', because her breasts are her strong asset. That is, '''UNLESS she can really act''' and/or sing well.

Then again, who knows how she looks with different hair, make-up, and more professional and touched-up photos.

No, you can't really feel the difference. It happened to me once in gym class. My friend had to tell me '''my boobs came out of my suit''' because I had no idea.

I searched Outie for this and didn't find anything on it, so I'll post it. If it's a repeat, just close it. It probably is, seeing as how most people on the net know about it.

www.myheritage.com

Go there and register a free account, and you can upload your pics and have it tell you which celebs you look like. It's apparently pretty sophisticated and scans bone structure and I don't know what else.

Something about me must be like Japanese, because I always get Bunko Kanazawa and Ayumi Hamasaki... and '''I have no Japanese in me'''.:blink:

why is everyone so caught up in the teeth? '''I think crooked teeth are cute'''.

Strange how some people are against fake boobs but think teeth ought to be straightened.

And, how do you guys ever find a girlfriend? You nitpick so much. How can anyone look at a girl as gorgeous as Ayaka and say "Her teeth are messed up?""
