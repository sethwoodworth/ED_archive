W-Hat
[[Image:W-hat.jpg|center|frame|A "[[Wario|W]]" hat.]]

'''W-Hat''' is a well known [[Something Awful]] goon group situated in ''[[Second Life]]''s Baku sim, which is essentially their own private sim. There, they engage in something that baffles the administrators of the game and strikes fear in other residents' hearts: [[fun]]. On a side note, Baku sim is really cheap to live in due to the W-hats driving its virtual real estate into the ground.

== History ==
Back in the prehistoric ages of SL, when giant bugs roamed the metaverse and [[delete fucking everything|ate fucking everything]], our lord Plastic Duck descended into the world and said: "Fuck you niggers, this sucks." Some other stuff happened and Baku was eventually built. He proclaimed that this was good, and that there were [[lulz]] to be had.  

Goons filed in and built marvelous creations, from flaming WTC towers, to completely theming the sim after some ''Zelda'' game. Some split off into separate [[troll|griefer]] groups like Voted 5, lead by Plastic Duck, wielding lolcubes and other weaponry of doom.  <s>They were banned from W-hat, as they had violated its non-griefing commandments.</s> Disregard that the voted 5 aka "mall rats" still are part of W-hat and they still grief. The voted 5 also called "Fab Five" embark in legendary quests of ass banditry.

== Activities ==
W-Hat mostly sits around in its own sim and creates daily controversy. They have gotten into a pissing match with former "reporter" [[Prokofy Neva]], and have constructed massive effigies to mock her. However, some of their best minds were banned during a Linden Lab banfest, so they are somewhat more quiet.
