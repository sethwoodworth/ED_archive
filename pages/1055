{{squote|Oh great! Another Hedgehog!|[[Special:Listadmins|ED staff]] upon seeing this article.}}

[http://www.youtube.com/user/BludshotTheHedgehog Bludshot the Hedgehog] is another [[Fucktard|fan]] of [[sonic|Sonic]] who thinks [[Tracing|tracing]] and [[Recoloring|recoloring]] [[sonic|Sonic characters]] makes him [[Kewlies|cool.]] This is not the only problem as he [[MS Paint|MS paints]] over pictures of Sonic then makes [[Shit|episodes]] of it, which are really [[Lulz|just slideshows]]. Now, all of this unnoticeable, but apparently these episodes and [[Original character|OCs]] make him [[God|the king]] of a [[Circle jerk|group]] on [[YouTube]] composed of [[Retards|Sonic fans]] and their [[Fursona|personas.]]  Bludshot's main 'character' and most original is...well...[[Furry|Bludshot the Hedgehog!]] And no, '''Bludshot''' is not a typo of Bloodshot, [[Awesome|it's just cooler that way!!11!]]

Typical of any Sonic fan, he doesn't take any [[Truth|criticism]]. If you do, your comment will be [[Delete fucking everything|deleted]]; as a result, there is way too much positive reaction on his page. 
As for the creator himself, he likes [[Shit|Nickleback]] and is an avid [[cosplayer]]. However, he broke all the rules of cosplay by being a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI_AkzIRF0E&feature=PlayList&p=609426A339932F80&index=5 Narutard and dressing like Cloud.] Bludshot does not find [[VTech]] lulzy nor [[Anti-lulz|does he like]] [[Mudkip|Mudkips.]] [[God|Bludshot the author]] also some strange [[fetish]] for Lime from some shit [[Anime|anime show]] as shown on [http://www.cosspace.com/ShadowCloud his Cosspace] proving [[furries]] can always find something new to [[Anti-lulz|ruin.]]

[[TL;DR]]: Bludshot and his little circle jerk of friends made themselves their own little [[DeviantART]] on Youtube. 

'''UPDATE!:''' Bludshot decided to make a [http://shadowashi.deviantart.com/ DeviantART account.] It's currently filled with his favorite soft-core porn. Sadly, all his accounts are abandoned. 

== Bludshot the Hedgehog Series ==
{{spoilers|text=HOLY SHIT! BLUDSHOT HAS SHADOW'S SHOES OR SOME SHIT! IS HE RELATED TO SHADOW!?!?!?}}

==== Bludshot the Hedgehog Episode 1: Enter Bludshot, The Deviled Hedgehog ====
[[Truth|The Best Movie Ever.]]

[[Image:08030816231.jpg|thumb|Bludshot IRL. [[No|Don't ya wish you were him]]?]]

The movie starts out with an [[EPIC|epic]], [[Fullmetal Alchemist|not stolen theme song]] setting the mood of the best 10 minutes of your life. Then it goes into when Bludshot was but a small [[Shota|boy]]. Everything is well, Mom is going to make his [[Pussy|favorite dinner]], and the Sun is shining. But Bludshot returns to his village, [[OMG|and IT IS ON FIRE!]] Followed by some [[You fail it|truly great voice acting]] showing what an [[Goatse|emotionally scarring event]] this is for Bludshot. [[A challenger appears|Dr. Eggman then reveals]] himself as the destroyer of [[New York City|the village.]] Dr. Eggman is actually [[Pretty cool guy|pretty nice]] about destroying Bludshot's village. Hell, Eggman gives Bludshot free shoes that make him run super fast! [[At least 100 years ago|11 years later,]] [[Asshole|Bludshot is still pretty sore]] about the whole "[[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|destroying the entire village and killing your family and]]  [[Noone|friends]]" thing, so he decides to kill Eggman. [[Hipocrite|Even though he is mad enough to kill Eggman, Bludshot is not mad enought to take off Eggman's special shoes.]] After some cutting edge animation, he finds Eggman, but something mysterious happens. Bludshot's power level goes [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|off the charts]] and he founds out someone is in his brain [[Bioshock|controling his moves!]] Bludshot makes a [[LOL WUT|deal with his brain]] [[Oh noes|but Eggman flew away.]] Bludshot decides to go find the [[Drugs|Chaos Emeralds]] for no specific reason.

The episode was sadly BALEETED,most likely due to copyright infringement or it sucks so badly.

{{squote|I need to go figure out what is going on inside me.|Bludshot the Hedgehog}}

==== Bludshot the Hedgehog Episode 2: Enter the Jake the Rok Fox ====
Nothing happens. Besides Bludshot getting a new partner, [[Furry|Jake the Rok Fox]](agian, not a typo). All Jake plays is [[Dragonforce|Nickleback]], [[LOL WUT|which Bludshot likes.]] We are then shown how [[hardcore]] Bludshot is when he beats up one of Jake's [[Troll|critics.]] Then Jake decides to follow Bludshot, and even though Jake is more annoying then Slippy from Starfox. Bludshot never kills Jake.

[[TL;DR]]: [[Fag|Jake]] is a [[furry]] that [[noone]] likes and is the series [[I did it for the lulz|just for comic relief]]. Poor [[Sex|relief]] at that.

==== Bludshot the Hedgehog Episode 3: Duo Problems ====
Nothing happens...No, really.
Fox finds a [[Nothing|Chaos Emerald]] and then there is some poor comic relief. The entire episode was to make Jake seem helpful for the first and last time in the series.

==== Bludshot the Hedgehog Episode 4: Enter Rocky the Boxing Echidna ====

[[Image:Bludshotvincentsame.jpg|thumb|There truly are]]

If you thought the quality was bad before [[Billy Mays|THEN THIS WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!]] Bludshot had to record the ENTIRE video on to a digital camera FROM the TV, so the focus keeps fading in out, plus they introduce a new character called Rocky the Boxing Echinda. Yes, Bludshot even ripped-off the Rocky movies. How Bludshot managed to get this [[shit]] onto teh TV when his [[Windows|computer]] was down, [[Noone|no one]] knows. 
Rocky the Echidna sounds exactly like [[Borat]], but with [[Autistic|Down Syndrome.]] Rocky then has the misfortune to run into Bludshot, [[Awesome|just in time to fight a fucking robot, again.]] They defeat the robot with Bludshot then [[Rape|asserting]] that he now has a [[Circle jerk|team]] that rips-off the "Sonic Team" [[AIDS|formula.]]


==== Bludshot the Hedgehog Episode 5: Team Blud ====
After taking 6 months to work on this video, Bludshot has truly returned to form of [[Sarcasm|making great videos.]] Using only the most cutting edge in [[CSIII|sprite animation]] and in no way ripping of Sonic Team, he truly makes an opus close enough to compare to his first episode. Essentially, Bludshot, Rocky and Jake are practicing their [[Orgy|attack formations]] until Bludshot goes [[Scene|all emo.]] Rocky bravely confronts Bludshot's [[Suicide|emo-ness]] and learns of Bludshot's horrible past. Then, Rocky and Bludshot get into a philosophical conversation of is it [[Drama|really right to kill Eggman even after all Eggman has done,]] reminding one of a scene from [[Old media|Watchmen.]] Finally, in typical Bludshot fashion, the team fights a giant robot...'''again'''...but they all learn the value of teamwork! Oh, and Eggmen says something about getting Bludshot's brain or some shit, [[Shit no one cares about|no one really cared that much about it.]]

{{squote|YT took it down, cause they're stupid |Bludshot the Hedgehog}}

But fear not, Bludshot [[Trolls|Fans]]! Bludshot himself has personally stated that when the first season [[2012|ends,]] he will "[[Fail|Re-do]]" all the original 1-5 [[Winrar|episodes!]]

== [[Marriage|Bludshot and Blitz]]: The Hedgehog Avengers ==
[[Image:BltzbludHA.gif|thumb|This is how he promoted this, which gives an idea of how bad it is.]]


What happens when all the A-list heroes disappear? You get J-list heroes to save the day! The story is just Blitz and Bludshot [[Secks|doing stuff]] and trying to save the day from [[Mrfetch|an evil villain]] who lurks in a [[MS Paint|MS Paint castle]] with the [[Communism|Soviet flag]] on it. [[I did it for the lulz|The villain plans to give everyone a curse mark to make them EVIL!]] There were also a shitload of [[Not|original Sonic characters]] that would cameo for one episode and leave. But in a Sonic first, the [[Fags|characters]] have to collect the chaos emeralds to defeat the bad guy!  These episodes were entirely impossible to watch, as the text can't be read since Bludshot thought it would be a good idea to make the [[Retard|text the same color as the character on screen.]]

== Characters ==
[[Furry|Bludshot]] has [[No life|a lot of time]] and spends it mainly on making [[Original character|OCs]]. What Bludshot and all his [[Retard|fans]] fail to realize is that all of Bludshot's characters are [[Recolor|recolors]] and even the backstories are uninspired much like many of the "artists" on [[Deviantart]].

==== [[Pretty cool guy|Bludshot the Hedgehog]] ====
An interesting fact is that Bludshot is actually NOT a recolor of [[Sonic]]. No, he is actually recolor of [[Chasethehedgehog]], proving that Bludshot is ACTUALLY the most original recolor ever, besides Shadow. He even carries [[Gun|guns]] that [[LOL WUT|he never uses]] and can turn black person at will. Also, [[Awesome|Bludshot has pants]]. Do any other (non-recolor) Sonic characters have pants? I don't think so. Even if he only wears pants is to give people the impression [[Bullshit|he has any sort of genetails.]] 
Bludshot has many [[Dildo|sex toys]] from [[slut|Ruby the Hedgehog]] to [[whore|Cassie the Bat]]. He is so knee deep in them girls, that he can't get them [[Rape|off him.]] But wait! Bludshot also has a [[Shit nobody cares about|dark and moody side of having a horrible past of getting his family killed and his village burnt down.]] Bludshit's [[shit nobody cares about|backstory]] '''IS''' like every characters' backstory in a Final Fantasy game. So keeping up with [[Anime Archetypes|archetypes]] of [[anime]] and [[video games]], Bludfag is all [[Emo|moody]] because of his past and tries to sound like [[Fail|Clint Eastwood or Cloud.]] [[Fail|BUT THIS ONLY ADDS TO BLUDSHOT'S AWESOMENESS!!]]

{{squote| I am a [[Camel spider|hedgehog]] you don't want to mess with!| Bludshot on Bludshot.}}

==== [[Emo|Emo the Hedgehog]] ====
[[Image:Emo_the_Hedgehog.gif| thumb | CRAWLING IN MY SKIN!!!]]
He is emo, what more do you want? Emo [[cutter|slits his wrists]], cries about having [[Truth|no friends]], [[Linkin Park|listens to Linkin Park]], [[lol|cries]], wears black, writes bad poetry, [[Stereotypes|wears the faggy emo hair]], and [[Pathetic|cries]]. [[Fag|Emo]] is just [[Original character|Sonic recolored]] in [[Nigra|black]] who just hasn't become [[An hero|an hero]] yet.
Emo is emo because he [[BAWWW|never had any parents]] and only his [[Noone|friends]] kept Emo [[Sex|happy]](contradiction:An emo is never happy, especially '''when your fucking name is emo''') One day, all of Emo's [[LOL WUT|friends die in an avalanche.]] [[Srsly|Srsly!]] Then Emo does the sensible thing and tries to become [[i told you i was hardcore|an hero.]] But [[Anti-lulz|Bludshot stops Emo,]] so he now lives on because it is what Emo's [[Lie|friends would have wanted.]]
When Emo isn't doing [[Cutting|emo things]], he is having [[Secks|sex]] with Goth the cat. It is <s>believed</s> known that Emo is Bludshot's self-insertion.
And who the fuck names their character Emo!?

[[Image:Emocomment.jpg|thumb|IT'S A CREATIVE IDEA GUIZE!!!1!]]

==== [[Goth|Goth The Cat]] ====
A [[lolwut|gothic]] cat-like creature, whom stumbled upon [[emo|Emo]] the Hedgehog, whilst he was under attack from one of Eggman's countless generic robots, despite having no [[Magic|special powers]] or other magical bullshit, she comes to the hedgehog's rescue (Seriously, what a [[Pussy|pussy]]), assisting in the brief conflict, and coming out on top.

After the dust settled, and this extremely [[Shit|cliche]] battle had ended, they both brushed themselves off, and stared into each others eyes. Love at first sight, [[amirite]]?

A deathly pale cat, with [[My Immortal|blood red hoop ear-rings, black jeans, red eyelids, black T-shirts]] (With such creative message's such as "HATE" OR "[[Fail|DETH]]" upon them ), [[Hooker|black thigh-high boots]], and...well, you get the picture.

Despite [[How do i shot web|trying to hard]] with the "dark!!1" appearance, Goth is, [[Irony|ironically]] the most original looking character in the Bludshot's rooster. Want some [[Moar|more]] irony? [[lulz|BLUDSHOT DIDN'T EVEN CREATE HER]] - That award goes to one: "[[Fag|Shadowfangirl101]]"

===The Non-Important Recolors===

==== [[Ninja|Jix the Chameleon]] ====
No one understands Jix, because he is a ninja. Jix really is just [[Gay|Espio]], but recolored, [[O rly|they even have the same damn backstory]]. Except Jix is '''way''' better than Espio.

==== Indigo The Hedgehog ====
One day, Bludshot awoke from cold sweat, he just had a stunning dream. No, not a [[masturbation|wet dream]] of [[Shit no one cares about|Lime]]. This dream would change the world, but thanks to [[Snapesnogger|shitty art abilities]] it all got fucked over. So Bludshot just recolored Silver purple and called the abomination Indigo. Bludshot then called it a night and resumed his wet dream.

Making a terrible character based on Silver, an already terrible character, is like any thing that George Bush has done. A seemingly okay idea, but ultimately catastrophic.

==== Pete The Parrot ====
A recolour of [[Drugs|Jet]], from Sonic Riders. 
He's Blue. 
He drives a blue Corbet, despite being a bird. 
He lives in a ([[Emo|blue]]) box with Cut-out windows.
And he never appears again.


==Butthurt==
[[Image:Bludshotgay.jpg|thumb|Notice how the [[Otaku|signature is in Japanese.]]]]

After his buttbuddy Blitz closed his Youtube account, Bludshot [[suicide|couldn't take]] any more of the hate recolors have to put with for being unoriginal pieces of shit. Apparently Bludshot is too retarded to find Blitz on DA.

===New Hardcore Designs===

Recently, Bludshot released a new [[Youtube|Youtube]] video, displaying his characters, "[[Fail|new look!]]"

'''Note:''' It would seem Bludshot has gained a new partner in crime, "[[Gurl|Sonicgirl21]]". While this may be a mere [[Sockpuppet|Sockpuppet]] account, or a completely new contender, we are not yet certain. Stay tuned for [[Moar|more!]]

Only a handful of his totally [[OC|original]] and [[fail|awesome]] OC's were re-recolored. As you can see, Bludshot looks like an extra from the newest [[Final Fantasy|Final Fantasy]] game, Ruby looks sluttier than ever, Rocky is still a black person (Only this time, [[Shit|Green]]) the [[Cock|Rok]]Fox Has seemingly taken a trip to the local [[Fail|Hot Topic]].


The [[troll|trolls]] attacked, and Bludshot cried. It would seem poorly drawn [[Flash|Flash]]work and eyegougingly bright colors were not quite enough to shield him from the [[H8|haters']] onslaught. 

If, for whatever reason, you found some enjoyment from his shitstorm, you [[Some Argue|may]] wish to check out her dA profile, which can be found [http://sonicgirl21.deviantart.com/ here] - This [[Troll|young lass]] seems to be the average dA [[Sonic]][[Troll|fangirl]].

Also: Yes, this is the same Sonicgirl21 as the one on [[Chasethehedgehog]]'s page.

== Bludshot's Dox and Haxz0red ==
So a friendly [[user:SnakemanEXE|troll]] and his friend decided to get Bludshot's password. They succeeded after finding it to be "peanuts". You know, that shitty [[comic]] strip on the newspaper. The troll posted two comments on two channels. One of his own, and another on SpazkidXD's. Months after this happened, the account was suspended. Oh, and also, his email WAS shadowhedgehog88@yahoo.com, until they hacked it too. [[Image:HAXXOR.png|thumb|And lulz were had.]]
[[Image:connecticonspammed.png|thumb|Yeah, this too.]]
[[Image:BludshotLieksLittleGirls.jpg|thumb| Bludshot tries to deny his [[pedophile|pedophilia]] by using the hacking incident]]
====The man behind Bludshot====
Bludshot's real name is Ryan O'Connell.
Now for a short list of facts.
*He lives in Connecticut
*Has a phone number of 860-682-3613
*Goes to an [[Autism|autistic school]].
*Also uses a [[Mac]].
*Is currently [[Poor|in some financial trouble]]. 
*He attends lots of conventions. Troll him IRL [[for great justice]]
*A friend of his, Nick Blevins (whose email is punkkrai@live.com), contacted Ryan shortly after he was suspended. 
[[Image:Tifa_who_did_this_to_you_by_ShadowAshi.jpg|thumb|What, faggots, cosplaying? Oh, you don't say.]]

== The "Forever Dwindling" Circle Jerk.==
==== Blitz the Hedgehog ====
[[Image:hyperblitzcharge.gif| thumb | [[Nazi|LOL HYPER NAZI!]] ]]
Blitz is Bludshot's buttbuddy. In nearly every one of Bludshot's episodes, their is Blitz the Hedgehog with his [[Homosexuality|ass ready for a pounding]]. The [[Bel-Air|two also cause trouble]] with other [[Recoloring|original characters]] on the Youtube. Blitz is just a recolor of Knuckles (and Sonic), but green. Also, judging from his interests, Blitz is a pure [[Americunt|American]] [[Redneck|white-trash]] with a love for [[Professional Wrestling|wrestling]], NASCAR!, [[Football|football]], [[Metallica]], and [[Offended|being offended at bad comebacks]]. [[2012|In the end, no one cares.]]

'''Blitz The Hedgehog and Trolling:'''
<center>{{fv|Blitzthehedgehog5|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;|<youtube>p3dHuk2vq5k</youtube>|}}</center>

In dealing with his trolling, Blitz has decided to respond to the [[troll|NastyPl0t]] video (above) by saying how much he doesn't care in a 6 minute deleted video. This of course falls flat on its face, even without him being butthurt about how [[ALL CAPS|HE WAS THE ONE BEING PICKED ON!!1!]] Later on, he even claims [[Lie|he can draw]] by showing off his shitty MS Paint [[tracing|trace]] of an Egoraptor cartoon.
In even further retaliation of the trolling, Blitz decided to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]] on his Youtube account. Good thing he still has other accounts still open.

The [[Guido|bastard]] finally just went ahead and said, [[ALL CAPS|"FUCK IT!"]] making an account on both [http://superpunk4life.deviantart.com/ DeviantART] and [http://superpunk4life.newgrounds.com/ Newgrounds.] As one could imagine, his [[DeviantART]] [[Sockpuppet|account]] is just full of [[Fail|fail]] and has decided to no longer [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|feed the trolls.]] The only he believes he can do this is by literally hiding all comments, good or bad or if their from his [http://superpunk4life.deviantart.com/journal/28419535/ "GF"] Blitz, after only being active on DeviantART for all of 3 months, has gone [[Batshit insane|completely delusional]] thinking that he can get into [http://superpunk4life.deviantart.com/journal/26281114/ an art college] with this [http://superpunk4life.deviantart.com/art/Sir-Goth-image-129182401 kind of amazing art.] One can tell that Blitz is [[Trying too hard|trying really hard]] to become the next [[fail|success]] of the art world.

Also, don't forget to check out his [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/sushihero/ Fur Affinity account]! Yes, it's true, he even draws [[Sonic the Hedgehog|Sonic]] [[Yiff|yiff]]...

====[[Fists The Echidna]]====
Yeah, she is in this too...

...But you'd never guess

====Darkdayton====
A person who was so un-creative that he had to steal one of Bludshot's characters. This...is a depth not even [[Anonymous|Anon]] would sink to. DarkGAYton is also is a wrestling fan(notice a pattern here?). Oh, and he yelled at some guy to give his fursona back, but as we all know(except for Darkdayton) that there are no girls on the internet. One other thing, all of his talking videos are in [[Microsoft]] SAM, even going as far as to [[Internet tough guy|'''make threats with SAM''']] [[sex|through]] his fursonas, even adding Chuck Norris jokes along the way. Way to go, [[Pussy|asshole.]] Now he doesn't exist anymore, he deleted his account.

====[http://www.youtube.com/user/Shadows1andONLYgirl Shadows1andONLYgirl]====
A confirmed [[fangirl]] on the [[Interweb|internet]] that took a character from [[Danny Phantom]], turned into a hedgehog, then paired with Shadow. [[Sarcasm|Wow, something mildly creative.]] She [[Secks|LOVES]] Shadow and is a [[Twilight|Twi-tard.]] Shadows1andONLYgirl is also making a [[Gay|Dawson Creeks]] [[Shit no one cares about|shit-stain for all the Tubes to see in anime form.]] Stay tuned for some more [[Lulz|lulz!]]

====[http://www.youtube.com/user/punkyfrewster Punkyfrewster]====
One look at her page will tell you that [[Wtf|Punkyfrewster]] is the [[Katy]] of this group. Complete with being [[bisexual|bi]] and [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|TOTALLY RANDOM]], but Punkyfrewster is far worse for she is a [[Furry|furry.]] Much like Bludshot, she has her own [[Slut|"show"]] of Sonic, but this time it is combined with [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7LI8V_Qp7M&feature=related Code Lyoko] and [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100 spelling errors.]] Still keeping in step of being a complete [[retard]], Punkyfuckster also has the [[ADD|compulsion]] to [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP5D5MbEobk&feature=channel_page 'hook-up' every single Sonic recolor] she meets. Thus coming [[vagina|full circle]] [[Truth|that all fangirls are retards]]. Finally, Punky is [[Almost raped|totally gay]] for [[Raptor Jesus|Jesus,]] which explains why she has so much [[Dick|time]] [[Cum|on her]] hands.

====[http://www.youtube.com/user/vaporeontrainer Vaporeontrainer]====
A [[PissedOffVideoGamer|fat, ugly]] [[emo]] [[Sonic]] fangirl, her recolor is a [[homosexual|purple Shadow the Hedgehog]] with [[at least 100]] forms. She refuses to listen to people that say her [[fact|recolors suck]], and constantly switches between her [[Michael Jackson|creepy voice]] and [[R9gay|Speakonia]] when posting videos. Also thinks [[retard|adding a racing stripe to an original character is a new design.]]

==Troll Videos==

Sit down and enjoy some videos of our [[lie|favorite]] recolors being mocked by [[YouTube|YouTube]].
