Rachele Rudd
{{an hero}}

'''Rachele Rudd''' was a [[16 year old girl]] from [[ghetto|Spencerport]],[[New York City]] who [[suicide| killed herself]] [[Last Thursday]] November 12, 2004.  She was the first to start  a trend of [[jloveb| MySpace suicides]] which means posting bulletins shortly before your death.

Rachele is rumored to have been very depressed about being [[raped]] by her father and wrote numerous blogs on her since deleted [[MySpace]] stating that he had only raeped her for the [[lulz]]. She was also [[almost raped]] by [[at least 100]] other members of her family.

==Series of Events==
Because being a [[hardcore]] Eating Feces fan obviously meant that nobody fucking cared about her or her obviously [[shit]] taste in music, she then started attention whoring via the [[internets]] in a lame attempt to gain [[fucking| sympathy]] from other like minded [[faggots]].

After her plan spectacularly backfired she looked in a dictionary to see what “failure” meant and was astonished to see a picture of herself which had been placed there by her parents some years previous, this in turn led to a [[lulz| catastrophic]] series of events which would see Rachele [[fuck you| flip off]] a train driver and her parents finally glad to be free of her whining [[emo|emoism]].

==The Train==
After staying up all night crying and watching [[Snakes on a Plane]] she overslept on the morning of her [[permaban]], this was of course no concern to her as the trains in New York always run late because they are usually driven by [[blacks]].

After making her way to the rails there was further disappointment  because despite the huge [[MySpace]] [[drama]] she created nobody turned up to watch because they all believed she was attention whoring although secretly they all hoped otherwise, and after waiting hours for someone to actually give a shit she jumped in front of a CSX freight train in true [[emo]] fashion becoming the first person to become [[An Heroine]] although [[An Heroine| Stephanie Browne]] has [[lies| falsely]] obtained this prestigious title.

==YTMND==
[[YTMND]] has spawned many a [[lulzy]] tribute page making fun of Rachele, although most of its users are too [[retarded]] to know her name and it simply falls into the category of “MySpace suicide”, “emo suicide”, or [[Chuoside|“train suicide”]].
