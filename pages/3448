"'''Got my girlfriend to model for my car (PICS)'''" is the subject line of the most viewed thread ever on [http://www.BodyBuilding.com Bodybuilding.com].

On Nov 6, 2008, user [http://forum.bodybuilding.com/member.php?u=361780 GPx] posted [[pic]]s of his [[Comic#Newspaper_comics|Doonesbury]]-eyed "[[trap|girlfriend]]" modeling for his Acura Integra in the MISC forum.  Although from the [[OP]] it was obvious that he is [[trolling]], in only three days the thread ballooned to a 1,800 reply epic saga with [[photoshop]]s and people making fun of the <s>poor [[kitchen|woman]]</s> fugliest woman [[OTI]], and [[over 9000|over 4 million views]] from around the world, making it the forum's most popular thread of all time [http://forum.bodybuilding.com/forumdisplay.php?f=19&daysprune=30&order=desc&sort].

As of December 1, 2008, the thread has been deleted.  We all took myspace [[screencap]]s, but like grade-A morons it didn't occur to us to archive the OP.

At first, Ellie made her [[MySpace]] private. After another day of mockery and endless [[friend|friend request]]s, she made her page public again. Lulz archivists hurried to take screen shots before she changed her mind again:

===Highlights from an entry===

*"[[lie|Some people think I look great in the bikni]], [[everyone|others]] (obviously) think the exact opposite....."

*"NEWSFLASH: I don't care whichever you think!! Everybody is entitled to their  own opinion and I respect that."

*"How about....a ****in' life, people?"

*"I must admit, the photo shopped pictures seriously made me laugh and forward them  to some friends of mine. Kudos to you photo shop artists. "

Sorry, "brah". Reverse psychology [[Don't feed the trolls|isn't gonna work this time]].

'''[[PROTIP]]:  don't claim not to care what ppl think in the middle of writing a full page message.'''  It's [[butthurt|too obvious]].''

[[Desperate|White Knighting for grade D pussy]]:

{{q|I honestly think [[your/you're|your]] very pretty.  The random internet dudes who are all virgins, wish they could come close to a woman of your caliber|Jason Fattyfuck..}}

{{q|I'm nobody's white knight, but the stuff was pretty fucked up, and I don't doubt for a second that you are probably pretty cool.

You're a pretty damn good lookin' girl

Fuck 'em.|HULK THRASH!}}

{{q|Stop your lying.  You know damn well that you don't think that she's pretty.  You're either tryin to hit that or cyber with her, though knowing what she looks like, you must be pretty desperate if you want either.

People have to learn that if you post pics on the web, well, prepare for the worst.|Waiting For The Free Handouts}}

Pwnt from the mouth of [[jailbait|babes]]:
{{q|you know what i think is ridiculous?
the fact that you say all of those threads don't bother you, yet you adress them in TWO different blogs.

quit pretending to be strong by telling people they're ignorant, you aren't hurting their feelings.
ignoring the situation would be the thing to make you seem strong.

im a sophomore in HIGH SCHOOL and i realize this, but you don't?
wow.|jessicalavon}}

One poster ventures a scholarly theory:
{{q|Looks like she was sodomized by the ugly stick.


And after the stick was done, he smoked a cigarette while he called over his friends, borderline disfigured stick and Jesus WTF is that stick. Then borderline disfigured stick and Jesus WTF is that stick double penetrated her anally while ugly stick throat fcked her.|EnergyTurtle}}
