Marcus Jannes
'''Marcus Jannes''' (8/22/1989 - 10/11/2010)  was a Swedish camwhore who became famous for his live streamed suicide. His Asperger Syndrome made him so rigid in his thinking that he believed that he must buy a rope to hang himself. Many Swedish working class heroes hesitated to turn off their computers and go to work since they feared that they might miss his death. Fortunately somebody told him that a network cable was sufficient to bear his weight, and he perished quickly in front of the viewers.
