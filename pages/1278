CSS
'''CSS''' can stand for one of three things:
*'''[[Cascading Style Sheet]]''', a major component of [[Web 2.0]]. Because [[HTML]] is supposed to only be used for content and not presentation, CSS is what's used for presentation instead. However, since so many people still rely on the <code>&lt;font></code> tag (including [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|this website]]), [[noone]] really gives a [[shit]] about CSS.  CSS is also very unintuitive, and it has no real way of centering dynamic content.
*'''Chatroom Showcase Showoff''', a game that used to be played on [[Golden Road.net]]. During an episode of <i>The Price is Right</i>, when it was time for the Showcase round, the users would play along in the site's chatroom with the contestants on the real show and try to bid on the price of each Showcase. The closest to the [[profit|actual retail price]] without [[epic fail|going over]] was the [[winrar]], just like on the real show. However, as of August 28, 2008, the forum for the CSS game appears to have been [[baleet]]ed by site owners [[emo|Marc Green and ClockGameJohn]]. This was due to the fact that Bitch FPGWilly got his ass beat so many times, he left crying like a baby. BRBTheFireBall(aka Black Bob Barker) kicked all their asses. End. of. Discussion.

*'''[[Counter-Strike|Counter-Strike Source]]''', a game played by millions of [[basement dweller|basement dewellers]] everywhere. 99% percent of games end with both teams calling the other team [[goatse|gay]] and calling [[shit no one cares about|themselves 13371337h@xz0rz]].
