'''MMGN''' is an [[Australian]] [[Videogames|videogaming]] [[flame_wars|website]], created when the [[God|owner]] of [[Pedo_Baiting|MyWii]], [[Trolling|My360]] and [[Sony_Defense_Force|MyPS3]] decided that he Jew, so combined the disparate elements into one giant site. 
Many people consider the [[Apartheid#The_End_Of_Apartheid|forced desegregation]] of gaming forums to have been a bad move, as it encourages [[Fanboy|fanboys]] to stray into areas where they may be unwelcome.

[[noone|Nobody]] actually knows what "MMGN" stands for. [[Some_argue|Some say]] it is an acronym for "[[Bullshit|My Media Gaming Network]]"; others believe it is more likely to mean "[[Truth|Milk My Gay Nuts]]".
