Completist

A '''completist''' is a [[fanboy]] or [[fangirl]] that must prove their devotion to a band, [[television]] show, movie or comic book by collecting every piece of [[Chink|Chinese]] made [[crap]] sold at Wal-Mart that relates to said media.  Symptoms include lining up at midnight to buy a new record, DVD, or [[dildo|toy]], constantly searching [[eBay]] for imports of the same exact [[crap]] from [[Japan]] and camping in line for years just so they can get tickets to a show before you.  There is a significant overlap between completists and fans of [[Anime#Pokemon|Pokémon]] and similar franchises, and this is expected given Pokémon's catch phrase "Gotta catch 'em all".  Some of the worst completest [[fucktard]]s are known to be so rabid that any mention of how much the old ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies suck total [[ass]] will bring down a legion of [[basement-dweller]]s stalking the shit out of you, trying to prove that when trivia night comes around you'll [[lose]].
