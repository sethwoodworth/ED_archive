==June 8th, 2008==

According to [[England|BBC News]],  '''Tomohiro Kato''' drove the sixty miles from his home to [[Tokyo|Akihabara]], using his mobile phone all the way to post to [[2chan|"an internet bulletin board"]] about his [[Assburgers|inability to make friends]].

{{quote|I will kill people in Akihabara. I will use my truck, and if it is destroyed I will use my knife.|Kato-san, making plans for massive <s>carnage</s> [[lulz]].}}


He hired a truck for a [[Grand Theft Auto|Sunday lunchtime drive]] straight up the middle of the pedestrian shopping street, mowing down [[indie|scenesters]], [[basement dwellers|bloggers]], [[pedophile|pedophiles]], [[Wapanese]], [[cosplayers]], [[furries]], [[otaku]], and  tourists alike. After mowing down as many unsuspecting spectators as he could, Kato attempted to mow down one of Akihabara's many [[Wapanese| fat American]] tourists, but found his ride was no match. Kato self-destructed his automobile, but not before leaping out to continue his vengeance on foot. However, in stead of using a [[Cho|firearm]] like lazy [[americunts]] would, Kato decided to go the [[ninja]] way, and drew his knife.

Kato murdered seven and put another ten in the hospital, which is a reasonable result for a city which has a cop hiding behind every lamp post. He receives full marks for style and execution. 

Critics are already playing the blame game citing everything from, and including, Japan's current economic climate, video games, anime, internet culture and Japanese schoolgirls. 


==Kato's Messages==

Taxed from [http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2337347,00.html News 24]:

==Fun Fact(s)==

*Kato is ''literally'' a backwards [[Otaku]] with a [[NO U]] complex. THINK ABOUT IT. Coincidence or <big><big>[[JEWS DID WTC|CONSPIRACY?]]???</big></big>
*Before the attack, Kato gave away all his stuff - a console and a box of games - to a friend. Some have speculated that he was a fan of violent shooting games, but this behaviour is more characteristic of an MMORPG player - "I@M QUITTIN IRL 4EVA, COME 2 LOBBY 14 4 RAREZ."


==Aftermath==

*Hysterical armflappers call for the complete ban on manufacture of daggers anywhere in Japan (actually true)
*Government request money to upgrade [[Mysterybot]] so that it will be able to notice Japanese Anons using the Chans to inform the world that [[Cho|V-Tech is about to kick in]] and send automatic warnings to the police (actually true)
*Sunday pedestrianisation of Akihabara suspended for the forseeable future (actually true)
*Konami cancelled the Metal Gear 20th Anniversary event (also true and GOD BLESS YOU, KATO)
*Japanese police to be issued with [[Power Wrist]]s, Power Gloves and [[Dongcopter]]s, and to drive around in cars that play the Robocop theme through roof-mounted speakers until they see the criminal, whereupon it will start playing the Chase HQ music. (We might have made some of that up.)
