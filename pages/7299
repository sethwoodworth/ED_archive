'''Scott Herman''', or [http://www.youtube.com/user/ScottHermanFitness ScottHermanFitness] on [[YouTube]], is an aspiring fitness model/guru who is allergic to wearing shirts. One of YouTube's most prolific uploaders, averaging [[at least 100]] videos per month, Scott Herman will explain to you the [[sound docking|ins and outs]] of fitness, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=petH8DrVf2c picking up people of unspecified gender], IM SO [[not gay|NOT GAY]] U GUISE ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE7ukQsco6E source]), and how to make homoerotic videos of yourself moaning while shaving your chest in the shower. [[Some argue]] he's a little too gay-friendly. Others say he's just [[gay|comfortable]] with himself. Either way, Scott Herman is a serious [[porn star|fitness guru]] and his videos are totally not softcore gay porn. At all.

==His [[Porn|Career]]==

After adolescence as a [[Magic]] nerd, Scott Herman first became famous when he was on [[MTV]]'s ''The Real World'', which is commonly known for only casting homosexuals, [[Affirmative action|race-quota add-ins]], and [[Ke$ha]] wannabes. During the show, Scott discussed his modeling career and tried to make it big as a [[porn star|model]], achieving some degree of success by reaching over 200 friends on [[ModelMayhem]]. Every [[16-year-old girl]] and gay dude that watched the show immediately began to stalk Scott [[OTI]], thus setting him up for his rise to YouTube stardom. Nowadays, while not shitting out shirtless workout videos with the camera zoomed in so far on his body you can't see the exercise, Scott fills his days modeling for gay magazines and bathing in spray tanner.

==[[USI]]==

In case you have [[Asperger's syndrome]] and thus could not tell, Scott Herman has unwarranted self-importance, and lots of it. Being [[Italian]], it is only natural that Scott's skin would be [[Jersey Shore|unnaturally tan]] and he would express an aversion to wearing shirts, as well as have an annoying voice. In one video, he discusses how a woman was shocked that he was single, trying to act humble but failing miserably. 

==YouTube [[Fail]]s==

Oh yeah, I'm so hot, lemme rub myself some moar (typical Scott Herman video):

==The Big Question==

Is he?

Well, he says he's [[straight]].

Does anyone believe that?

[[Truth|No]]. He says he has a [[Brazil]]ian girlfriend now.

[[O Rly]]?

[[Some argue]] she is in fact [[MTF]], but there is no evidence one way or the other of this claim.

More evidence he's about as straight as [[A Perfect Circle]]:

He went to a gay club:

He hates [[Fred Phelps]]:

And of course:

==His Fitness Site==

[http://www.scotthermanfitness.com It's a pay site.] [[Cock|Hmm, I wonder what you're paying for]], "meal plans" seems a little [[semen|vague]]. The site is low in [[lulz]], but it has a high concentration of random exercises [[no one]] can do unless they live at the gym, which many of Scott's fans do, cruising locker rooms and the like.
