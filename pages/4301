[[Image:MarthaElwoodCAM.jpg|thumb|right|And [[internet disease|'more']]]]

'''Jessica Elwood''', real name '''Martha Martinez''', is a [[furry]] artist/[[attention whore]]/balloon enthusiast/fraudster who lives in [[Mexico]]. Widely known for inflatable-titted art and drawing the same shit over and over again, she makes a comfortable living creating art for paysites and scamming the fuck out of anyone dumb enough to give her cash.

Jessica is well known for taking money for commissions from idiot furfags who want [[Allan|shitloads of drawings]] of their murrsonas, then making them wait [[Forever|indefinitely]]. Some of the furries in question still have not received artwork they paid for '''2 years ago'''. Jessica is completely above reproach, however, since she posts pictures of various [[Nudes|nekkid chix]] on her [[deviantArt]] account, and fucking idiots like the furries [[Fapping|jerking off]] to Elwood's various drawings of shiny balloon tits don't understand [[no girls on the internet|some of the basic tenets of internet society]]. 

For years Elwood had claimed her real name was Jessica Jazmin Colaneri but this entire persona was faked for attention and to manipulate people. The big-titted Cali girl is really just a typical ugly [[mexico|spic]] who steals and begs for money to feed her [[weeaboo]] habits such as collecting deformed animu figurines and various swords in order to [[360 Kid|brag about them on the internet]].

== Scamming == 
[[Image:JessicaElwood Fagoneer on JE Translated.png|thumb|left|[[Dragoneer]] crunching numbers ([[Retard|JessicaIngmannish]] translation).]]
[[Image:Relatives1.jpg|thumb|right|Two of Martha's closest relatives. If you are male run for your life]]

Elwood is notorious on the internets for not doing her half of art trades, and taking money from furries via 'commissioned' artwork that never appears. 

Giving anything to her is akin to lighting your cash on fire and stuffing it up your ass- [[Truth|no wait, some furries are probably into that.]] Any queries after the status of said artwork leads to being ignored, or on the rare occasion a response is given it will be of the pathetic excuses variety. A quick look over the journals on Elwood's DA account will show constant [[BAWWWWW|bawwing]] about how she can't draw in an effort to pacify unhappy commissioners. 

Any comments on her page asking about anything owed will be hidden. The only way to get art from Jessica, or a refund of your interest-free loan, is to threaten to [http://community.livejournal.com/artists_beware/tag/artist-jessicaelwood make it all public].

If you are male, expect to be offered stolen images of camwhores and amateur porn as compensation. In fact, there's also a good chance Martha may even try to initiate an [[internet relationship]] for further swindling purposes.

===Boyfriends/victims===
[[Image:Elwooddanote.jpg|thumb|right|A message between Martha and one of her victims. She gave him a fake name (Tamara) and had been gifted over $2700 by him over the course of their relationship.]]
[[Image:Elwoodsobstory.jpg|thumb|left|Evidence that Elwood's woes were premeditated manipulations to obtain money from people.]]
Not long after joining DA, Martha got together with [http://crybringer.deviantart.com/ Crybringer], and they were together for quite some time until Elwood decided she had sucked enough giftart and popularity out of him. This lead to a very [[no|amicable]] breakup involving Martha making accusations about how Crybringer [[lol wut|e-raped her]] on AIM. 

Following this, Elwood moved onto greener pastures, which involved leading on lonely males - undoubtedly several at once - obtaining gifts from them and anyone else foolish enough to donate money after being suckered in by false promises, lies, and sob stories. She bleeds men dry with no remorse. [[tl;dr|A clear example dates back to March of 2009. On the Swords of Might forum, under her CountessaAsryon alias, Martha posts a topic stating that by the end of the month she will have $1500-$2000 to buy a new katana with. On March 25th, surely enough she posts a journal on DevArt crying that her computer is broken, and takes money from people for 'repairs'.]]

===Elwood apologizes===
[[Image:Elwoodapology.jpg|thumb|right|Jess unsuccessfully tries to save her ass on FA by issuing an apology to fans.]]
After being featured on the LJ community Artists_Beware for a second time, Jess tries to save her ass by issuing [[bullshit|a very sincere apology]] to fans and asking to be reminded of what she owes them. Hilariously, [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1526272/ the majority of commenters] state that they do not believe a word of this after waiting for years and being ignored multiple times.

Over the course of Elwood's multiple fuckups and lies the only people who 'support' her are those who did not actually give her any money. Once again proving that the majority of furries are [[virgin|idiots]] who will make excuses for any sort of behavior as long as their wank-material still gets churned out. Meanwhile the unhappy commissioners are stuck listening to Martha's rabid [[retards|fanboys]] 'forgiving' her on their behalf. How nice!

===More money gone than speculated?===
It appears [[Dragoneer|Fagoneer]] is actually doing something for once, trying to tally up the amount Jess owns. According to Dragoneer one fucktard spent '''over $1,000''' on commissions for Elwood that they never received. Of course, Jess was only doing commissions for people with big mouths since she did not give two shits about her fans, but only her status. Following the example of her instantly doing a commission for someone who reported her to the LJ group artists_beware, JE would only dole out pics to those who would land her in court otherwise.

It was thought only a mere couple of thousand was lost to JE - now it's seemingly much more. JE confirmed for money laundering jew. In fact all your money has already been spent on her [[weeaboo|collection of swords.]]

===Art Theft===
[[Image:elwoodrecycling.jpg|thumb|right|If you ever get art, expect it to be traced from softcore porn and recycled.]]
[[Image:elwoodstolenbackground.jpg|thumb|left|Elwood's art, and the [http://www.daz3d.com/i/3d-models/-/brianas-temple?item=8306 uncredited resource]]]
Not content with stealing money, cheating customers, lying to get donations and shafting people in art trades, it has been revealed that Martha [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|steals the backgrounds for her art as well]]. Those wonderfully rendered backgrounds are not her work, they are in fact filtered shots from 3D programs.

Of course, these are used with no credit being given whatsoever. Any omitting of the truth to make her seem more talented is A-OK by her!  Who wants to bet money Martha didn't even pay to use it for one image of hers? And even if she had, the fact remains she didn't credit it. 

Unsurprisingly, she's been half-assing all of her recent commissions with subpar anatomy, coloring, and effects; now she won't even bother with an original background that she was paid to do. I can haz $100 plz.

Lucky for you, there's more! When she actually bothers to do work that she's been hired for, Elwood likes to be paid for it twice. Note the image to the right where the two sketches are practically identical, and had been sent to two different commissioners at the same time. She has, in the past, also taken at least one commission paid for by the customer, and used it as a submission for a different paysite as well.

== Identity==
[[Image:Martha_head.jpg|thumb|right|Martha Martinez, Elwood's real identity..]]
[[Image:elwood2006paypal.jpg|thumb|right|Paypal record showing Elwood accepting payment through her Martha Martinez account three years prior to the creation of the [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/kaceywyandotte/ Kacey sock-puppet account].]]
[[Image:Elwoodhypocrite.jpg|thumb|right|Martha doesn't approve of stealing photographs! lolhypocrite]]
[[Image:jessilliteratemexican.jpg|thumb|right|One watcher points out that Martha types like an illiterate mexican]]
This cocksucker, surprisingly, has a history of pretending to be other people. At first it was limited to sending nude pictures to [[faggot|'popular']] artists in the hope of getting free art or nudes. This was first exposed  when the pictures got leaked and it was discovered that she had been sending pictures of different girls to various people. Some of the differing batches were given to the [[retard|same people]], who soon worked out that the photos were not of the same person and thus were fake.

Not learning her lesson, the attentionwhoring continued with Jess posing as various different girls until she found one [http://camerellacams.com/blog/ she liked] Posting these fake pictures on DA, Jessica Elwood's pageviews got higher than ever, leading to the creation of a <s>[http://jelwoodphoto.deviantart.com/ photo account]</s> - BALEETED! Deactivated after the true identity of the model was found out. Way to go!

===Jessica Jazmin Colaneri===
According to [[white knight|wikifur]] and claimed by Martha herself, Jessica Elwood is supposedly called Jessica Jazmin Colaneri and lives in California - '''now proved otherwise by an FA admin''' and as of 2nd August, finally admitted by Elwood herself. 

Elwood had posed as a hot Californian girl until now with some measure of success despite having an IP address that traces to Mexico and it is possible that before this she initially pretended to be a man going by the name of Arturo Juarez aka "[[Bubba]]"  as they shared the same MO of not doing commissions and trying to get nudes from people. This has not been officially confirmed, and some have voiced the theory that Arden was a victim she stalked, so judge for yourself.

===Sock-puppetry===
'''AmoreNerezza'''<br>
Back in 2006 when Elwood was dating Crybringer they were supposedly in a [[lie|'hot threesome']] with a latina going by Amore Nerezza whose supposed 'real name' was Natalia Asuncion. Her (now-empty) DA account can be found [http://amorenerezza.deviantart.com/ here.] It was also claimed that she was a model they used for reference. Originally Elwood posted a journal asking people to welcome her 'friend' to DA, and her watchers found many similarities in their art style. A week after it reached the point where JE had to issue a denial that they were the same person, the account was [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|cleaned out]] and she has not been seen since.

</gallery>

'''Kacey Wyandotte'''<br>
The paypal account Elwood uses (materiainfernal@yahoo.com.mx) belongs to a Martha Guerrero Martinez, and initially this person was claimed to be a [[samefag|'student']] of hers going by the name Kacey Wyandotte whose FA account can [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/kaceywyandotte/ be found here]. Both accounts have used this paypal and share a same IP address. <br>A fake image Martha sent to people under the Kacey alias can be found in the gallery at the bottom of this page. 

Kacey says in the description of [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2240417 this image] that Elwood had been giving her ''online'' art classes which has now been proven to be utter [[bullshit]] as they are the same person.

Martha also registered a Kacey account on DevArt [http://kaceywyandotte.deviantart.com/ here.] The account is empty, and in a hilarious display of of what a hypocrite Martha is, that account was solely used to blow the whistle on a [http://kaylarachal.deviantart.com/ Camerella faker] [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/13550303/1461142678 back in] [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/13550303/1460939082 April].

A paypal record (shown right) also reveals that Elwood has been taking commissions with the Martha paypal account as early as 2006, approximately three years prior to the creation of the "Kacey" account, further proving the sock-puppetry between the two accounts.

===Arden the Black===
[[Image:Ardenquits.png|thumb|right|Arden posts a goodbye on May 24, 2005.]]
Arden quits art on May 24, 2005. Elwood signs up for Playmouse on July 18 2005, DA on Aug 12 2005 and FA Dec 13 2005. At this time Elwood's style clearly resembles his and despite his disappearance Martha claims to be getting 'tips' from him. A bit like how JE claimed [[lie|Camerella was a good friend who she was working with, and how Kacey said JE was her mentor.]]

[http://playmouse.com/Your_Account/profile=9568.html Arden the Black] has also gone by the name of Midflare, and had a character called '''Jazmin''' Dandelot. Interestingly enough, Elwood herself has a character called [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/1070353/ Jazmin] and it was the middle name of Jessica Elwood's supposed 'real' identity (Jessica Jazmin Colaneri). Arden also had a girlfriend by the name of [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Gravewalker Gravewalker aka Sunny '''Colaneri'''] Yes, this is where Jessica Elwood's [[lie|'real name']] comes from. she had to rip her new fake name from someone else. Art by 'Arturo Juarez' and 'Natalia Juarez' can be found [http://us.vclart.net/vcl/Artists/Natasha-Fatale/index01.html here]. Note that 'Natalia' has a chicken character named Natasha who resembles that of JE's KaceyWyandotte sock-puppet account. Not only that, but 'Natalia' was also AmoreNerezza's supposed real name, as evidenced by [http://web.archive.org/web/20071014211910/http://amorenerezza.deviantart.com/ the wayback machine.]

===Martha Martinez===
Enough evidence has been gathered to prove that, instead of being a male in earlier accusations, Jess is actually a Mexican girl known as [[powerword|Martha Martinez]].

Back in early 2009 Jessica signed up to a forum known as [http://www.swordsofmightforum.com Swords of Might] under the handle CountessaAsryon. Now:
*CountessaAsryon is a reference to [http://crybringer.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d8r4w5 Countessa Tesryon], a main character of [http://crybringer.deviantart.com/ Crybringer]'s comic. [[shit nobody cares about|Note that Crybringer is Elwood's ex]].
*Her signature said her name was Martha, and also had the quote "You can think I'm wrong, but that's no reason to quit thinking". This quote is also on her FurAffinity as her favorite quote. [[gg]], Jess.
*She posted a [http://jessicaelwood.deviantart.com/journal/22604095/ dA Journal about swords] on the 16th of January '09. She was gifted a sword, a [[shit nobody cares about|Bushido Raijin katana]] to be exact. At the same time, she posts on the Swords of Might forums with links to pics of her new sword.
*[http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/183059/ She has been a fan of Katanas for at least two years before joining Swords of Might].
*Her Paypal is verified under the name of Martha Martinez.

Conclusion? Jessica is really just a chubby Mexican chick and a pathological liar.

As of August 2nd 2010 Elwood has admitted that she is Martha, after being exposed by uncontroversial evidence. As expected, many of her [[retard|fans]] welcomed their boobie-drawing [[ugly|goddess]] back with open arms, proving that furfags and weeaboos possess no moral compass whatsoever. A small number were [[butthurt|intelligent]] enough to declare that they were done with the bullshit and unwatched her, however such right-thinking folk are vastly in the minority.

== The Admission ==
[[Image:camtwitter.jpg|thumb|right|On her twitter after being asked by fans, Camerella doesn't know who JE is.]]
[[Image:jessadmission.jpg|thumb|left]]
After being exposed and failing to cover it up by deactivating the 'model' account, Elwood posted a journal admitting the pics were fake.] Said journal has been deleted, but a [http://jessicaelwood.deviantart.com/journal/33996888/ second apology and admission to guilt has been posted]. Of course, this was already obvious to anyone with half a brain; JE didn't fool anyone except the legion of brain-dead [[underage|15 year old]] [[fanboy]] [[virgin|sheep]] she gathered due to her pathetic furry smut. Note that in the apology Jess is still lying, saying Camerella was a friend and they planned it together.

Camerella initially denied having anything to do with Elwood and did not know who she was, but after learning more of the situation she admitted to being hired a few months ago by Jessica for sessions where the sign pictures JE posted were taken. Some of the other photos JE used were stolen from Camerella's websites however and she did not give permission to be impersonated.

==HACKED!?==
[[Image:Elwoodgallery.png|thumb|right|Images uploaded during the feigned 'hack']]
[[Image:Hackdoubters.jpg|thumb|right|Few are fooled by Martha]]
[[Image:Elmanfaking.jpg|thumb|right|The pics on JE's gallery were taken from the 1st page of google images]]
[[Image:Elwoodstorage.jpg|thumb|right|Proof that the art was [http://jessicaelwood-club.deviantart.com/gallery/?25215253 put in storage] and not deleted. What hacker does THAT?]]
[[Image:ArshesDAban.jpg|thumb|right|Elwood had already committed a bannable offense on DA with the identity theft.]]

After the shitstorm on [[DeviantArt]] went out of Elwood's control, her DA was conveniently [[lies|'hacked']] in a [[bullshit|very unconvincing manner.]] Elwood was still hiding comments she did not like - such as people calling her out on her bullshit, any mention of Arden or speculation of her being male - right up until the 'apology' journal was deleted and replaced with the 'hack' entry.

It happened at the same time as this very article was vandalized, and all the deviations were put into storage rather than deleted. Not to mention the distinct lack of goatse, Elwood talking like her usual English-garbling self while posing as a "hacker", and the fact that her FurAffinity account was left untouched. 

ED is not responsible for the 'hack' and [[b|/b/]] have denied being behind this, or at least the members of /b/ that weren't too catatonic after repeatedly smashing their faces into their own keyboards, as is their custom. Elwood has scarcely been talked about outside of furfag circles, and was essentially completely beneath everyone else's radar before this recent loldrama.  

General consensus among non-retards is that an actual raid on Elwood's profile would not have entailed lame suicide jpegs that show up on the first page of Google image search, and instead more [[goatse|shock images]], obvious Elwood bashing, faux-public confessions, [[truth|admitting to being Arden]], unblocking everyone on Elwood's blocklist, targeting Elwood's other identities and not just DA, etc. <br>The "hacker" did post some crude shock images to Jessica's gallery, [[obvious|but only after comments on the page mentioned that Anon would have employed much more goatse by then]]. JE may have lurked 4chan, [[fail|but not long enough to get any of the memes she used right]]. Note that she even got [[retard|"Never forgive, never forget" the wrong way around]]. [[Anonymous]] himself could not be reached for comment, though neighbors and close relatives report that he has been passed out in a [[jenkem]]-addled haze since [[last Thursday]], thus freeing him of all charges. 

[[Image:Elwoodjournal2.png|center|frame|Notice that she got "Never forgive, never forget" the wrong way around. Not even newfags fuck this up.]]

<br/>Despite her [[Fur Affinity]] account remaining intact and initially being given protection by the admins, trying to come up with some sort of [[lie|cover story]] for the great unwashed furry masses to swallow was beyond Martha's ability because according to one of FA's admins Elwood logged into her account under an Australian proxy (instead of her usual mexican IP) but never addressed the issue at all, and she was finally banned from FA for commission fraud.

On the subject of the Australian proxy, it was also stated by one of Martha's mouthpieces that the IP account that performed the 'hacking' of the DA account [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/33439607/1568176267 was also Australian]. [[No|What a coincidence!]]

[http://www.onhercam.tv/video/camerella-has-love-for-4chan-b?nats=MC4wLjguOS4wLjAuMC4wLjA Camerella made a video thanking /b/.] After being asked about this she said it was for the increased spike in traffic to her site coming from there and [[dumbass|thanked them for 'getting rid of the Elwood faker' "because it seemed relevant at the time".]]

{{clear}}

===Unbanned from DA===
[[image:EldudeStorageCrop.png|center|frame|As of 14 July 2010 Martha's dA account was unbanned. A browse of her gallery shows all the deviations in storage, delivering endless amounts of TOLD to "JE" fans.]]

DA unbanned Elwood a short time later and as of yet she has still not removed her deviations from storage. If one's account was hacked and vandalized you'd think they would instantly revert the 'damage' done but suspiciously Martha seems perfectly happy to leave it that way for now.

Despite all evidence to the contrary, many furfags are shitting their brainless opinions in support of Martha all over deviantART and Fur Affinity. 

Somehow, some way, there are still fucking idiot furries out there who want to show support for this lying, stealing degenerate because she draws tits. This support comes in a few different flavors, and may contain one or more of the following traits:

*Offering support/[[internet tough guy|protection]] to Martha
*Saying something to the effect of "It's okay I forgive you now please draw more tits"
*Saying something to the effect of "It's okay I forgive you now please show me your real tits"
*Saying [http://tarnishedangels.deviantart.com/art/Jessica-Elwood-Support-WIP-171410078 "Who cares if she lives in Mexico? DO YOU HATE MEXICANS? U RACIST"]
*Saying "Who cares if she lied for 5+ years and scammed multiple people by accepting their money for art commissions that will never be completed? I am here for the <b>[[fap|art]]</b>, and everyone should just ignore the scamming and lying and let it go on completely unhindered!!"
*<b>Expressing belief that Martha was actually hacked and eating right out of her greasy, burrito/dick-scented hands in the process</b> (See below:)

==FA Admins prove Elwood's IP comes from Mexico!==
[[Image:Arshes1.jpg|thumb|right|FA admin's post]]
An Administrator on FA has looked into the issue and [http://forums.furaffinity.net/threads/77410-Rave-Something-funny-on-a-wet-weekend/page4 in this thread], and has confirmed the aforementioned claim that Elwood's IP traces to [[Mexico]]. This led to an edit war and more [[faggotry]] than usual on [[WikiFur]] due to [[butthurt]] [[white knights]] who can't handle the [[truth]]. Even now after Elwood confirmed that she is indeed Martha Martinez and lives in Mexico the article is constantly being revised with euphemisms to make her actions seem harmless, including describing the commissions she owes (and never had any intention of doing until being forced to) as being "tardy".

== Elwood finally owns up to being Martha ==

[[Image:JEconfess.jpg|thumb|left|[http://jessicaelwood.deviantart.com/journal/33996888/ Journal can be found here]]]

One again, Elwood only owns up to the truth after her hand has been forced. Like with the commission fraud, proof of her real identity was compiled and documented extensively to the point of being undeniable which was the only reason she came clean.

[[idiots|Some]] have taken this as a good sign, believing that the handful of commissions posted from her [[over 9000|huge backlog]] to be undeniable proof that Martha is changing her ways. While it is true that she has not taken the account-hopping escape route this is simply because she does not want to lose her precious [[attention whore|pageviews.]] The commissions Martha has completed so far are also incredibly sub-par in comparison to her usual [[shit|art.]]

Note that other than admitting her true identity everything else in the journal is incredibly vague ''"Some things are false, others are true"'' and she still insists that her account had been hacked. It is the Elwood method, admit the absolute minimal amount of truth while still transparently lying about everything else and hope that no-one notices.
