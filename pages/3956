Icy Hot Stuntaz

Icy Hot Stuntaz is an [[unfunny]] [[old]] internet [[meme]] of three [[wiggers]] imitating American [[black|urban culture]] and professing that they are definitely not a [[parody]]. They were the center of a lot of [[flaming]] due to their lameness and further denial of being a parody. The high point of their [[stupid|stupidity]] was photoshopping fake "bling" into their photos, while leaving their acne-ridden close-ups unretouched. Clones of this site were created later after it attracted so much attention.
