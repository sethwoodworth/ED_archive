'''Gamespy''' is confused with spyware, where [[nerd]]s can get together with their e-friends in a vain attempt to arrange an online game. ''Gayspy'', as it is [[Hate|affectionately]] known, incorporates [[at least 100]] [[shit|useful]] and [[wtf|intuitive]] features to make arranging games with your non-existent friends as easy as [[pie]].

==How To Use Gayspy==
#Log on. Spend [[at least 100]] hours looking for the right chatroom for the game you want to play. Chances are, this room will be completely empty, but if by some chance someone is present, spam them with [[Desu|DESU DESU DESU]] and requests to play until it is painfully obvious that they are afk. Leave, unfulfilled and as [[basement_dweller|lonely]] as when you started. 
#Repeat
#????
#PROFIT!

==The Point of Gayspy==
Gamespy allows insecure individuals to play online multiplayer games in a physical, social and technical [[retard]]-friendly environment. Game stats at the end of a particularly good round are often [[screencap|captured]] and posted on large [[lemonparty|videogaming forums]] to boost their [[e-penis|e-peen]]. 

Lets fce it even [[Gamefags]] is better than this Piece o' shit game site.
==Games That Require Gamespy to Play==
Any [[old|old school]] game with no inbuilt server browser feature.

==Games That Work With Gamespy==
''[[Superman 64]]''
any game you should [[an hero]] over if [[you]] [[Retard|need help]] with.
