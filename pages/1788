Cory Doctorow
[[Image:Corymagickingdom.jpg|right|thumb|This is one of Cawy's favourite tourist photos, since he shows everyone what he thinks of them. Only problem is that '''his''' Magic Kingdom is covered up (see below).]]
Cory Doctorow<sup>[[âœ¡]]</sup> is an egotistical [[in the ass|ass]]/[[Internet celebrity]]/[[hipster]]/self-promoting Jew and [[IRL]] bureaucratic fuck. Ten years ago he was just this guy, y'know, who'd fucked up and flunked out of no [[less than three]] university degree programs. Realizing that he was rather a dim bulb as a result, he decided to be Mr. Braunschnozz, bullshitting, shoving, and brown-nosing his way into as many bureaucracies and cushy positions as possible. 

==BoingBoing==

Cory likes to say that he runs the [[BoingBoing]] (gee, isn't that just the whackiest!) web logs.  Cory (or Dr. O, as he likes to be called) and his underlings steal ideas from other popular [[weblog]]s and post them on BoingBoing, usually years after everyone else forgot about them&mdash;showing, like [[Paris Hilton]], that you really don't need any skills to be popular.  If you keep telling everyone you meet that you are popular, it will eventually work.

==EFF==
[[Image:CawyCape.jpg|thumb|[[Facepalm|This guy wastes our air.]]]]
Until Cawy took over the [[EFF]] (Electronic Frontier Foundation), it was devoted to freedom of speech and action on the Internet. Under his careful guidance, the EFF has become the Electronic Fuckface Foundation, a career step for [[lawyer]]s and opportunists like himself. Cawy is now Mr. EFF, too! Everyone at EFF loved Cory so much they shipped his pale ass to Europe, then he "resigned."

==Play-acting==
More than anything but stacks of money, Dr. O likes pretending to be an author.  He releases his books both in stores and on-line under an [[open source]] license so that he will have a convenient excuse for their shitty sales. He drops a lot of 1337 in his books, as if desperately trying to say
::''Hey, man, I'm fully down with those groo-vey hacker cats, like, daddy-oh.''
Cawy has the uncanny ability as a short story author to take a subject that you would think might be really boring--like IP law, venture capital, yard sales--and by adding just a few sci-fi elements to it, turn it into something really amazingly boring. 
[[Image:Cory2ndlife.jpg|thumb|left|Apart from the pre-rhinoplasty nose, Cawy has really prettied his Second-Life avatar up! Who wouldn't want to fuck this?]]

===Second Life===
Since he's too lazy and unimaginative to make stuff up, and doesn't have to try too hard with all the money he gets from being an [[IRL]] bureaucratic fuck, Cawy's stories are all drawn from his exciting experiences in [[Second Life]].

==[[Internet Disease]]==
When Dr. O isn't busy being an [[IRL]] bureaucratic fuck or pretending to be an author he likes to log on to wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cory_Doctorow#Picture_linking and manipulate the article about himself], although apparently he is incapable of signing. A quick look at his [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=250&target=Doctorow contributions] shows the depth of his love affair with ... Cory Doctorow.
[[Image:Cory_doctorow.jpg|thumb|right|Cawy in another favourite pose, playing Twotsky in a T-shirt (wouldn't his folks be proud!). Hard to find a pic. of this guy that isn't ridiculously flattering, which is a symptom of [[internet disease]].]]
==[[Disney]] Obsession==
Obsessed with the Walt Disney company, he even calls his haircut [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cory_Doctorow&diff=50686839&oldid=50685380 the Magic Kingdom]. Whenever forced to travel without his personal barber, Dr. O carries a picture of the Magic Kingdom (yes, the haircut) on his person.

==Plain old insanity==
His daughter bears the unfortunate moniker of ''Poesy Emmeline Fibonacci Nautilus Taylor Doctorow'' ([http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/03/fine-news.html no, '''really''']).
