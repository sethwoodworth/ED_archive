'''[[Uncyclopedia|Unc]] drama coming up on [[Playstation|Eyetoy]]''' is a meme started in [[MSN]] [[ED IRC]] (chat was dead in IRC) and goes to prove that you should [[STFU]] when someone else is talking or else things that don't make sense will be read by people [[stalk]]ing the conversation. The original log that was then spammed was:
 Prima says (8:15 PM):
 unc drama coming up
 Secunda says (8:15 PM):
 on Eyetoy

The original context had something to do with [[loli]]s playing [[playstation]] and [[Uncyclopedia]] [[luser]]s being [[unfunny]] as usual. After the original use it was [[cuntpaste]]d again and again by ShadowCrush (a [[Freewebs]] [[n00b]] who was also involved in [[MSN]] [[ED IRC]]) and from there into the original [[ED IRC]] which was currently in a state of [[chat]] [[dunnage|deadage]].

Using the [[physics|physical]] law of [[Forced Meme]], after being repeated enough times, it became very funny.
