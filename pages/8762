On a map of DeviantART's popular section, roaming somewhere near the [[chasethehedgehog|top ten percent]] there will be a large, unnaturally-colored [[furry|kitsune/dog/cabbit hybrid]] with ear-fluff longer than its legs and an [[iPod]] blasting out [[emo|Fall Out Boy]]. This is [[bitch|Vanillakitsune]], AKA <b>Ashley Jefferson</b>. Her birthday is March 31 (Confirmed by a fellow furfag).  Troll on her b-day for xtra luls.

She's an [[Snapesnogger|immature bitch]] who draws exactly the kind of [[shit]] that will never get her or her art anywhere in life. Her style is <i>apparently</i> meant to resemble [[Disney]], because she <i>apparently</i> [[bullshit|has the talent to get a job there]]. All she drew before finding Kuitsuku was a bunch of carbon copies of [http://chikapika.deviantart.com ChikaPika]'s drawings with some gay [[animu]] thrown in. What's funny is that since Kuitsuku herself copies Disney and some anime known as Bleach, her current style is a double rip, creating a [[time paradox]]. And now her human style has turned into a pathetic rip of [http://jubilations.deviantart.com/ Jubilation]'s art. If you try to point this out to her, nicely-worded or [[troll|otherwise]], she will shrug you off as jealous, even if your art skill [[pwns|surpasses her own]].

==Art(?)==
If you are fortunate or brave enough to look at her [[fail|art]], you'll notice that among other irregularities, around the necks and chests of all her animals is a distinctly lion-like mane. One would assume that these are [[Theft|'referenced']], but no, she believes that she made these up, and that they are [[Lie|the most original thing ever]]. She says they are [[What|chimera]], and her fans believe anyone else who has a [[furry|chimera]] character is copying her.

<b>WHAT THE BOOK SAID:</b>
Don't rip off other artist's concepts, characters, etc, but practice drawing off of a well known artist (such as a famous painter, for example, like we all did in high school art class) in order to gain basic skill that you can then mold into your own style.

<b>WHAT THIS ENTERED VANI'S BRAIN AS:</b>
OH MY GOD... IT SAYS... DON'T STEAL...BUT THEN STEAL!!

This of course caused her to do a [[barrel roll]] and stop listening to anyone who tried to explain directly to her what this article just said behind her back.

<p></p>
If you get into an art college/school it is universally known you must be at least DECENT at anatomy. This is one of the many things Vani is not good at, and animal anatomy is quite harder than human. She covers all her mistakes in [[kawaii]] ribbons, bells, etc, thinking this will cover up for her total lack of knowledge for anatomy. 
<p></p>

Vani thinks you're a jealous prick if you try to critique her work even in the nicest way. In any way at all really.
All the internet fame has gone to her head so now she thinks she will "LIEK, TTLY GET A REEL JOB". But in reality, companies will hang her resume and art up by the water cooler so everyone else there can get a [[ConceptArt|good laugh out of them]].

== OHMYGAWD YOU GUYS Vani is totally original...? ==

Image:Disneyclip.gif|Even with this provided as evidence, she denied it. 
</gallery>

Even though she can't stand people picking off 'little things' from her reference sheets, she's been busted stealing more than once. From simple details like similar attitude and strange abilities from popular [[anime]]. She of course denies this, and if a picture of hers suddenly disappears from her devianTART gallery, it was undoubtedly because someone called her out on her theft and provided evidence that she couldn't accuse of being fake.

She also rips off her coloring styles from much more established artists. If you see a good artist put up a coloring tutorial you only have to wait until Vani's next picture where she will claim she's changing her coloring style 'to be original'. Instead she creates a sloppy substitute.

==Recent Drama Bullshit==
Even though she claimed that she 'hasn't even had drama with anyone in months', this recent (first week of April 2008) chat log posted to Vani's LiveJournal (and now, funnily enough baleeted) says otherwise. It also says that Vani's logic needs some <i>serious</i> fucking work. Vani started this argument after she was given a thorough and very helpful crit. 

<code>
<b>Roxeiyurame:</b> Lol... the fact that you can't even draw a cartoon dog yet you still think you're the shit says a lot about what you consider to be "art". xD;<br>
<b>heartattack high:</b> ..i think that says more about what you consider to be art.<br>
<b>heartattack high:</b> since when does not adding unnatural colors, human hair, corset ribbons, bells, & other unappealing shit to dogs equal not being an artist..<br>
<b>Roxeiyurame:</b> At least i'm not the one who got rejected from SROA. e_____e;;<br>
<b>heartattack high:</b> ..sorry to say, vani, but SRoA is not the staple of the art world. get hired by a major company that has a lot of successful output into the professional art world (as opposed to an oekaki full of spam wars)  then you can come back & I'll listen to your bullshit about what's art & what's not.<br>
<b>Roxeiyurame:</b> Your habit of using and symbols instead of typing AND is really annoying. o_o; Can you seriously not type A N D?<br>
<b>heartattack high:</b> oh hi, cheap shot. of course i can fucking type 'and', I'm a ninth grader, vani. i don't see any reason why using & is a symptom of retardation.. the symbol '&' actually represents 'and'. & if you're going to be like that.. it's called an ampersand, not an 'and symbol'.<br>
<b>Roxeiyurame:</b> Way to get off the topic. 8D<br>
<b>heartattack high:</b> ..what. i was talking to you about art, you brought up the topic of my typing habits, & i responded to that. playing the 'i'm going to drag you off into another discussion & then bitch you out for being offtopic' card doesn't work with me, vani. & just for the record.. read back through this conversation. everything i say, every point i make, etc, you reply to with something definitely not directly related. if you're so right & i'm so wrong, shouldn't it be easy to disprove my points instead of avoiding them? hm. this is where i block you, tbh.
<br><br></code>
Even though this conversation shows Vani getting pwned hard [[in the ass]] by a sooky fourteen-year-old emo kid, she still posted it to her LiveJournal... apparently under the delusion that she was so right and the girl she randomly sparked an argument with was nothing but a bitch. Wtf.

<gallery>
Image:Vanillakitsunenewdrama.png
Image:Vanillakitsunecritbullshit.png
Image:Vani_crits_long.jpg
</gallery>
Another crit was received on the image which, in Vani's defense, she didn't reply negatively to. This is probably due to the fact that this artist belongs to her oekaki and therefore wasn't much of a threat.

The conclusion? Vani hasn't changed a bit; her oekaki is full of bitches; she'll never really get anywhere in the art world; she ripped the hideously-done candy shading off a more talented artist named Kaydee; her humans suck ass; etc. Why somebody would want this in their college is anybody's guess.

== Defense ==

If anyone at all states any of the content of this article to her she runs to her journal in a fraction of a second and makes a giant and poorly written rant on how she is super-original. She also expects her fans to [[TL;DR|burn their retinas out reading this]] on whatever obnoxious color scheme she's bestowed upon her journal.  Whenever someone opposes these shitstorms, she will usually reply with a one sentence answer which is always the same, and tells the artist [[Dick|their work isn't worth stealing]]:

{{quote|"You know...people like us only rant about it because it happens all the damn time. Like every DAY. Its probably doesn't happen to you... so... you don't know what it feels like. 0_o;"|[[emo|Vanilla Kitsune]]}}

[[Image:rant_1.gif|thumb|right|Part 1 of TL;DR thief rant that she deleted once attention was called to it here.]][[Image:rant_2.gif|thumb|right|Part 2 of TL;DR thief rant.]]

{{quote|"[[Teruchan|I'm popular, you're not]]... so I don't have to listen to you.  I’m always right.'''}}

The main problem here is that Vani assumes that everyone (else) thinks she's the best artist ever and the first to use any cool idea. This kind of attitude has rendered her completely unable to take critiques. very time anyone is seen giving her a quality or even minor critique you can expect Vani to either ignore them, hide behind excuses, or try and puff up her huge mane of fur and state obnoxiously that she knows animal anatomy better than anyone else. When doing her tryouts for the Suta-Raito Advanced oekaki, she even wrote off every single critique into excuses, then got her friends to vote her in.

If more than one person exposes her for the fake she is, she will write <i>another</i> journal throwing <i>another</i> whine fest about how wrong they are and how they can never understand the strain her popularity puts on her.

She will delete these journals less than a week after making them, complaining about the problems it's been giving her. This is, of course, just in hopes that she'll get enough of an asspat from her fan base before [[Anonymous]] come in, screen cap it, post it up here and point out the stupid shit she said.

To further push her down the spiral of artistic failure, the only times she does acknowledge a critique and/or suggestion is when it comes from one of her SEXTASTIC idols (Huskie, Evana, etc.) She doesn’t actually act on these suggestions, just agrees with them.

==In My [[ED]]?==

On November 25, 2007 Vanilla Kitsune discovered [[lulz|ED]] and began to [[butthurt|BAWWW]] all over her LiveJournal, devianTART, and... basically anywhere she'd get attention.  Not smart enough to actually provide an alias she posted it under her [[weeaboo]] [[sockpuppet]], [[user:Reversed pocky|Reversed Pocky]]. She first decided to write a [[TL;DR]] entry discussing copyright claims to her pathetic characters.  Figuring (correctly) that [[duh|nobody on ED would give a shit anyways]], she then proceeded to [[delete fucking everything]].  This created about 2.72 seconds of [[e-drama]] until she learned the hard way that [[ED: VIP|Vandalism is Pointless]] and she swiftly got [[banhammer|B&]].


*'''The [[epic]] [[fail]], word for word:'''

{{quote|'''"Removed this page-didn't agree with it at all. and it wasn't factual. You didn't have permission from any of the people to post there art or characters. It was dangerous for us if they one of our characters got stolen. You had no (c) on it or anything. And putting personal info on here isn't right.''' 

'''any complaints from the person who wrote this please note me at my dA: reversed_pocky.'''
"|[[user:Reversed_pocky|Reversed Pocky.]]}} 

Note the absurd amounts of fail. Not only did she [[spell check|misspell dangerous]], but she also made the mistake of thinking that Encyclopedia Dramatica would care about people stealing her characters, which are basically stolen from other people anyway. Also note the change in tone from [[bitch]] to concerned [[SysOp]] to [[offended]] [[victim]]. And on top of it all, she also failed to create an alias, [[fail|using the exact same username for her Deviantart account and Oekaki account.]]

[[Image:ReversedPocky.jpg|thumb|right|[[lies|IT"S NOT PORN IT'S ART!!!!]]]]

She could be seen [[divide by zero|Dividing by zero]] until the active [[SysOp]] put her in her place. 

{{quote|[[Tits or GTFO]]|[[User:Drunkenlazybastard|DLB]]}}

'''As requested make sure to tell her all of your complaints here,''' {{deviantart|reversed-pocky|Reversed Pocky}}.  One can only hope that afterwards she will soon become [[an hero]].

== Haterz from the DevianTART community. ==

On Christmas day, 2005 one of VK's biggest fans created a tribute for her [http://vanillakitsunesucks.deviantart.com/] and proceeded
to rip apart some of her deviations. Anatomy problems and duplicate poses between her pictures were pointed out to her. VK's best defense was "It's just a reference, it doesn't matter!" (yet whenever someone else 'references' her work it turns into a bitchfest in her journal... hmm... VK is a HYPOCRITE? No, she's God, how can this be...?)  Thus, her Christmas was ruined further. First she got the wrong color [[iPod]] case, now this? Unfortunately for the rest of the world, VK did not [[emo]] cut herself. There was also a time when some people made accounts and had the name "haterz" in it. Their dA pages had a shitload of VK bashing. The haterz raided VK's pages and her "furends"' pages too. It went on for several hours.

== LiveJournal. ==

[[Image:VANILJLOL.jpg|thumb|You cannot hide.]]
Vani, under the username Vanikins, wrote a lengthy journal about this article on her [[Livejournal|LiveJournal]]. A bit of super sleuthing provided us with her LiveJournal link. 
When checked a day later, she had made the entry '<s>Ass Kissers</s>Friends Only'.  But she insists she doesn't really care.  She did it for the [[lulz]][[fail|(But we all know she just used lulz as a net to catch her from the vat of fail she has been wading in...).  Luckily for you, it has been screencapped.

[[Image:Vani.PNG|thumb|After showing a reference drawn by the old owner of the character, she says this. Can you say ASSHOLE?]]

==General selfishness/fail== 

Since Vani is too lazy to get a job at her age (she's a <strike>senior in high school</strike> junior in art school, we all had jobs as freshmen) and wants expensive things, [[whore|she can be seen whoring out her overpriced commissions]], and then refusing to draw anything that isn't a dog, selfishly demanding another character, even if the commissioner has paid her to draw a human. Not only that, but she'll even create character designs for you! Which you'll probably end up getting sued for since they're most likely stolen. 

She can be seen whining in her journals on Christmas and stating that [[Paris Hilton|she didn't get the right color iPod cover or she got some cheaper item rather than the 'super awesome' expensive one she wanted so very much]].

Her parents can be seen buying her expensive shit left and right (such as a brand new car as her first one long before she needed one, and fancy clothes). Vani has not had to pay a cent for anything in her life and is a spoiled brat. This complaining of course gets to the heart of her [[morons|fans]] who will spend hundreds of dollars on her merchandise. They pay for postage as well. And yet not a single fan sees anything in return, not even so much as a thank you doodle. Vani is too 'busy' to thank all her fans. Busy doing what? [[Masturbation|God knows.]]

Even when she has tons of commissions to focus on waiting on her dA account (about 50 commissions at last tally because she had to pay for her sextastic trip to whereeversville) she has no problem spending that money, saying she's suddenly in an art slump and then running to her [[LiveJournal]] exchange community and drawing for them, for FREE. Not only this but instead of posting a simple character description she spams half the page with [[xbox|huge]] descriptions of her Mary Sue furries. She then requests you draw them with their internet fuck buddies, as demonstrated:

"She's a MOMMMYYYY...and a wife. Here's her super nerdy homophobic asshole of a husband. 8| So if you want to make this super awesome ( yes I love that phrase ) and draw them together then, lol here's his refs. Double DOES have an anthro form...there’s just no reference.
and Trixy also has a pet Cabbit, named Star-Ohki. (8 "

"DESPITE HER LOVE FOR LYING TO GUYS TO GET WHAT...she wants. Yuna has a super awesome boyfriend, named JASU ...ok... Jason. She likes to call him Jasu because I don’t know, maybe it’s an Asian thing. So if you wanna draw her with him then that would be awesome."

"Hi. She's taken. If you wanna make this SUPERAWESOME you can draw her with  her um... boyfriend Reed. Here's his quad and werewolf forms."



Speaking of commissions what is this bullshit we see here? [http://vanillakitsune.deviantart.com/art/o-o-87630282 100]  personal pieces of artwork and not a single commission in sight? I thought she was suffering from art block.


As of 2010, Vani's accomplished absolutely fuck-all! She currently attends '''Ringling College of Art and Design''', though [[Money|how]] the fuck she got in is beyond the rest of us.

Despite paying 40k a year to attend a decent art school, however, Vani feels no need to exercise work habits like the rest of her classmates.

Some things never change.

== Fuuuuurrrends... ==
 The most frightening of these friends is Trixity.  Trixity’s [[furries|fursona]] was completely made by Vani and her actual [[shit|art]] usually contains eyes larger than the world.  It’s quite the sight.
 
Vani is aware of how much these friends love her, so she makes her characters date her friends’ [[furries|fursonas]] and make ass-babies with them.  She assumes that everyone loves these couples as well and will make a reference to them anytime she can.

It appears that any of her devoted [[fans|minions]] will argue to infinity about how perfectly VanillaKitsune/Vanimute captures form and line, despite their idol not being able to capture either. However, should they be found in a debate about [[similar|stolen]] artstyles, they are not above attacking those with disabilities in order to distract the "heretics."

==I RLY HAET THEM BUT I DONT.==

VK takes pride in bitching about how much people love to steal her ideas/original style/etc.  [[Truth|She was never original from the start]]. She loves complaining, making long journals and flaunting about how much she hates when people steal her things. Of course all of these rants just blow to the wind when she finds and artist whose artistic skill rivals/[[pwns]] her own.

A small example would be the 'artist' Kaziczek-Wolf. One quick glimpse through her gallery reveals that she is <i>for once</i> the epitome of what Vani bitches about: [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/48631561/?qo=7&q=by%3Akaziczek-wolf&qh=sort%3Atime+-in%3Ascraps]. Vani lives for this. 

Supposedly though, Vani is only 'watching' this artist to 'keep tabs' on her and make sure she doesn't steal any more, when in all seriousness we know that Vani does not hold the mental capacity to conduct anything this intricate. She's in it for the art and the butt-fuck. It should be noted that Kaziczek-Wolf evidently "DOES NOT CARE" about this part of the article. Thus proving that she is nothing more than a VK cock sucker. Normal common sense should usually tell a person that when their 'friend' is talking behind their back something is wrong, but we must all remember in the world of Disney-Animu nothing has to make sense. This includes anatomy as well as common sense for your own wellbeing.

==Suicide is FUNNY!==
[[image:Vani-lolsuicide.gif|thumb|right|...oh that's too bad. :'3]]
Vani beat the odds by stooping even lower in her recent LJ post. After crushing on a guy and finding him in a bed with another girl, Vani obviously HATED HER GUTS!! Not that she had a chance with the guy to begin with, since he ''told her straight to her face that he can't stand her.'' I wonder why. As Vani mentions in her post, it would seem this girl recently killed herself. Vani's response? 

{{quote|"I mean I thought..him and Mina were having relationship issues NO SHE WENT AND KILLED HERSELF. It's horrbile to laugh but I can't help but chuckle. I couldn't stand this girl. Oh well, GOODBYEEEEEEEEEEE."|Vani, a woman of morals}}

That's right, folks. Suicide is nothing to feel bad about, especially if you don't like the person! It's chuckle worthy, even! 

==Trends/Moar Rape:==

Vani, who seems to have since forgotten Yu-Gi-Oh!, after being shown the abridged series by Littlekuriboh on Youtube.com, began to quote the series at every waking moment of her life, even in her tutorial on how to use oekaki. On a side note, this tutorial is a failure, just like everything else she does. 

Vani has stated many times her goal in life: start an animation company with her [[sockpuppets|friends]].  Before this, she wanted to work at Disney.  With an artistic knowledge of oekaki and a shit education, I’m sure we can all look forward to her amazing motion pictures soon. 
  
In order to look cool or be one of the [[Anonymous|cool kids]], VK has begun naming the titles of her [[shit|artistic creations]]  after [[/b/]]'s [[meme]]s such as "[[So i herd u liek mudkip|So i herd u liek mudkip]]".  But since she rapes any trend, she instead mutilates the humor with phrases such as "so I herd u liek Yogurt".
