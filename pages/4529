'''Scott Charles Goehring''' (transsexually, '''Kelly Lynn Martin''') is a long time denizen of [[Usenet]] going back to the early 1990s, and a perennial source of drama on [[Wikipedia]]. Kelly's a [[MTF]] too. Whenever a sensitive situation needs to be dealt with calmly, this darlin' is the one you send to blow it up into a massive [[drama bomb]].

==Who is this lady of the night?==
Kelly is the founder of the anti-Scientology, anti-Jewess-Barbara-Schwarz [[Usenet]] newsgroup [[alt.religion.scientology]], the leader of the anti-Scientology clique that migrated from alt.religion.scientology to [[TOW]] when TOW still belonged to Bomis, and the one who lets his artificial vulva be penetrated by [[Rebecca|Rebecc]]o. At first glance, one might assume that this pair of bureaucratic fucks do not belong in this article, due to being female, but as it turns out, this is not the case. Ambi/Rebecca controls the transsexual articles and edits them so much, [[some argue|some have argued]] that s/he is really a [[shemale]]. Oh, and it turned out he-she-it is! Both Rebecca and Kelly Martin are [[transsexual]], and both were apparently born with [[cock|male equipment]], making them prime candidates for inclusion. This infamous pair of abusive admins have long had a strong influence in Wikipedia's [[internet court]], both having been arbitrators, and both with access to the Mediawiki checkuser function.  [[Wikitruth]].info has discovered that Kelly Martin's birth name was a different, male one and contains a picture proving the [[sex]] change. [http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Kelly_Martin]  He-she-it also started a [[lulz]]-inducing dramafest by deleting a large number of [[userboxes]] in early January. In August, Kelly turned her userpage into begging page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AKelly_Martin%2Fold&diff=54057335&oldid=52286257], since h/she was too poor to attend [[Wikimania]].

==Kelly Martin is a rape victim!?==
On her blog, Kelly states he-she-it is a [[rape]] victim [http://nonbovine-ruminations.blogspot.com/2007/08/wikipedia-to-jayjg-please-leave.html]. Inquiring minds must know: Was this before or after the sex change? If it was before, did it turn him into wanna-be girl? If it was after, was the guy actually fooled into thinking Kelly was born a woman?

==Anti-$cientology==
Back before Kelly changed her name from male to female, she founded alt.religion.scientology and was even interviewed by wired magazine; see [[Wikipedia:alt.religion.scientology|Wikipedia's alt.religion.scientology]] article. Her anti-[[$cientology]] buddies that migrated to [[TOW]] are [[Tony Sidaway]] and [[David Gerard]] both of which are to a degree transsexual like Kelly. It is unknown if Kelly participates in the [[Project Chanology]] IRL protests.

==Ding, dong, the witch is dead==
Kelly Martin, the [[bureaucratic fuck]], got tied up by [[bureaucratic fuck]]s! [[wikicide|S/HE'S GONE]]1!!1![http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=76978683] Strangely however, Wikitruth has flushed all articles referencing him. [[zOMG]] [[drama]]!  Shortly after the deletions by Wikitruth, Kelly Martin blogged about what s/he refers to as "the decline and fall of Wikipedia civilization".  [http://nonbovine-ruminations.blogspot.com/2006/10/somnambulation-i-am-exceptionally.html] (mirrored [[Kelly_Martin/somnambulation-i-am-exceptionally|here]]).  [[lulz|And if you think any of this is funny, Fuck you. Just fuck you]]

==Further humiliation==
At the beginning of December, despite saying he-she-it had left Wikipedia for good, Kelly nominated himself-herself-itself for the [[ArbCom]] election. Needless to say, the Wikipedia community showed him-her-it exactly what they thought of him-her-it. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006/Vote/Kelly_Martin]

Since not being welcomed by the main cabal anymore, Kelly has taken to jumping into requests from new users to become administrators and making asinine reasons to oppose.  Then from afar on his-her-it blog, he-she-it writes scathing catty blog entries making fun of Wikipedia - and usually right!

Even if he-she-it is a catty unpredictable power-hungry maledog-bitch, at least Kelly hates [[SlimVirgin]]!

==Further further humiliation: Kelly Martin RFA II, in 3D==
As the last hours of September passed Kelly managed to drag "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Kelly_Martin&diff=next&oldid=159036161 three fools]" out of the Wikipedia-en-admins [[IRC]] channel to nominate her for [[sysop]]s. Unfortunately for Kelly, one of the fools was [[Danny]], and like always, his touch was the kiss of death. He was even forsaken by long time cronies [[David Gerard]] and [[Tony Sidaway]], who never even bothered to show up, probably because they couldn't drag themselves away from their [[Bisexual|bi]]-[[porn]] to support him/her/it. As time apparently does not heal all wounds, and his-her-its [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Kelly Martin 2|RFA]] was promptly flooded with enough opposes to sink it within a single day, a speed usually reserved for clueless [[noob]]s or [[Flameviper|trolls]], so fast that Giano and Geogre barely even made it in time. ''Whoa!'' [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=13051 The vultures] at the [[Wikipedia Review]], expecting a ''"foodfight of biblical proportions,"'' instead had to settle for a mere windfall of lulzy "oppose" votes. Even [[SlimVirgin]] exited [[Wikibreak|hibernation]] to tell Martin [[No one likes you|that nobody likes him]]. [[Wikipedia:User:Walton One|Walton One]] says ''"I very rarely oppose RfAs, but I think that this candidate would do an astonishing amount of damage to the project."'' [[Wikipedia:User:Giano II|Giano]] weighed in with ''"[[Attention whore|just the normal attention seeking behaviour that we are all...used to]]"'' And finally one straight out of '''[[Disney|Aladdin]]''' from one of [[Grace Note]]'s [[Brisbane]] buddies:

{{Quote|'''Smite.''' Oh my gods, User:Kelly Martin sounds like a villain, once deposed as the Grand Vizier, coming back to claim their title and their throne, feigning change but staying exactly the same. Geez, some of these diffs could really be compiled into a villain song for Wikipedia: The Musical, possibly titled "You Seething Idiots"; her comments are so poetically uncivil they should be collated into a handbook on How to Be Dastardly: The Elegant Way.... great entertainment, but no. No tools for you.|[[Wikipedia:User:Deus Ex Machina|DEVS EX MACINA]] 00:25, 1 October 2007 (UTC)}}

[[Miltopia]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Kelly_Martin_2&diff=161543346&oldid=161514574 tried to reopen the RFA] for his favorite girl, but it was sadly not meant to be. Once the Grand Vizier of the Wiki, Kelly now found that her [[Bureaucratic fucks|former allies]] who had once kowtowed to her every whim ([[Baleet]] all [[Userboxes]] etc.) were no longer quite so loyal. Long time Kelly-[[hater]] [[Email|Mailer]] [[Devil|Diablo]] was there to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Kelly_Martin_2&diff=prev&oldid=161548380 deliver] the coup de gr√¢ce.

{{Quote|'''Over my dead body'''. Will definitely go [[Tony Sidaway|Sideways]] with mop, I can confirm that and add three years' warranty to my statement, or your money-back guaranteed. Candidate is one of the most Machiavellian editor I have ever seen in the whole of this encyclopedia. As the instigator of the [[Userbox]] [[War]]s back in [[2005]], she is responsible for all the subsequent [[Wiki]][[Drama]] that followed, and the irreversible damage and brokenness of the [[VFD|Deletion]] and Requests for Adminship process and the trust in the [[Internet court|Arbitration process]] being destroyed before my very eyes and being turned into a circus. Wonder why you have the [[Politically correct|political correctness]] of !vote and the mantra Adminship is not a vote!? This is the reason. Also has proven to have an extensive history of Cabalism in the admin [[IRC]] channel, still remains on such form of communications and very likely to continue. Giano's issue is only simply mere the tip of the iceberg. To hand the mop over and [[Unrealistic Expectations|expect it not to be used like a]] [[Gun|RPG-29]] within the fragile walls of the encyclopedia would surely be a [[joke]]. Not forgetting the continuous hostility, incivility and combativeness against other editors who are helping to write and build encyclopedia and seeking to drive them out. To promote her as adminship would not just allow her to just proverbially climb the Reichstag, it would be signing your way into the Dark Ages, [[For great justice|which must be prevented at all costs]]!|[[Wikipedia:User:Mailer Diablo|Mailer Diablo]] 12:48, 1 October 2007 (UTC)}}

So in conclusion, [[karma]] [[bitch]][[Oneoneone|!!!111]]

==[[Irony]] of her image==
Despite Kelly being born a man and still looking a bit like a man, there's [[over 9,000]] diesel dykes with extremely short hair that look more masculine and less hot than she does. Basically, if you're a lesbian and you look less like a woman than Kelly Martin, something is wrong with you.
