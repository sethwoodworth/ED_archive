GABYAW
An [[acronym]] which stands for ''"Get A [[Blog]], You [[Attention Whore]]"''.

Most commonly used for the girls who put photos on [[jailbaitgallery.com]] who post items to [[communities]] or [[forum]]s that would be more suited to a personal [[LJ]] (or blog).  

==Example==
User A is a member of {{ljcomm|user=knitting}}.  User A posts to {{ljcomm|user=knitting}} to talk about how they are going to [[Finland]].  
Of course, they knit in Finland, too, but that's not the point of their post to the community, and they don't even mention knitting in the post, they just want an ''audience''.

User B gets first comment, and decides to ''make it count,'' thusly: ''"GABYAW."''
