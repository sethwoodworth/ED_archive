[[Image:Winterfresh.gif|thumb|right|Fanlisting button. [[Fangirl|Fangirls]] have up to two million on their personal websites.]]'''Fanlistings''' are a wide variety of small Internet groups of people that share an interest in a certain topic.
Many people own Fanlisting Collectives, where they express their unnecessary love for everything from [http://fan.eracio.us/lipgloss/ lip gloss] to [http://friction.baptism-of-blood.net/indexx.php Gay sex] (Lol, it's called "Friction"). 99% of them are run by [[girls]]. Many 4channers have attempted to troll them, but because fanlistings are [[serious business|srs business]] and so addictive, they've found themselves frantically hunting for a fanlisting about The Notebook, all the while not realizing that [[noone]] cares what your interests are.

== Other Fanlistings ==
Addicted like a [[crack]] user yet? The fun does not stop there. There are Hatelistings for showing how much you hate consensual sex, Anime Listings for showing how much you enjoy [[Sailor Moon]], and even Physical Fanlistings for showing how much [[you]], the faggot you are destined to always be, are obsessed with Kevin Bacon's voice.
