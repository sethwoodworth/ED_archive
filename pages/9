*nix
Refers to various derivatives of the [[UNIX]] operating system, and systems inspired by it which are similar in design and user experience.  All of these operating systems are completely superior in every way to [[Windows]], that is, if you know what the fuck [[LOL WUT|"sudo chmod g+w /usr/bin/p*"]] means.

Some notable UNIX-derived and UNIX-inspired systems:
* AIX
* [[BSD]] and derivitives (DragonFlyBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, [[lie|WhiteHotShitBSD]] ...)
* HPUX
* IRIX
* [[Linux]]
* Minix
* [[Ubuntu]]
* [[Solaris]] (earlier and internally SunOS)
* [[Mac OS X]]
* Windows NT
* [[Game Boy Advance]]
* [[God]]
* [http://lng.sourceforge.net LUnix] - not only a [[Something Awful]] joke.
