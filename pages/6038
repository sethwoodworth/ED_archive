Operation Awesome

{{stub}}

From the [[btards|performance artists]] who brought you [[Operation Lioncash]], '''Operation Awesome''' is another [[meme]]tics experiment which will attempt to turn [[OTI]] lulz into [[IRL]] <s>lulz</s> arrests by [[graffiti|tagging up]] the [[Awesome]] smiley all over the place using a stencil. Any color paint, and any location (though preferably in areas people will see it) is deemed acceptable. As always, the [[pix or it didn't happen]] rule is in effect.

Although it can be performed whenever the fuck you want, [[anon]] hopes that the [[ATHF|biggest raid]] will hit on [[9/11|September 11th, 2008]] for an [[old media]] win and produce epic <s>lulz</s> [[party van|vanz]] (see [[ATHF Terrorist Attack]]).

It is supposed to end on 9/9/09, or [[shit nobody cares about|something like that]]. In all likelihood, [[at least 100|10-15]] [[idiots|individuals]] will do this, and the rest will forget immediately after the current thread [[404]]s and something else comes along.

{{quote|We could sign it with anon at the bottom of the stencil, that would be awesome. It would be like a group of people saying a collective f**k you to society, [[facepalm|pretty awesome message imo.]]
[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]|[[You]]}}

Use this thread at Vent Chan to continue discussion when the current [[threads]] [[404]]: http://www.setbb.com/ventchan/viewtopic.php?t=17&mforum=ventchan <-- Lol [[Baleeted]]

==Operation Awesome on Drawball==

Currently in progress, Operation Awesome Drawball is an attempt to completely cover the site at http://two.drawball.com in /b/'s ejaculations of yellow, black, white, red, and pink ink, transforming it into awesome smiley.
