'''Vox''' was a [[Dead|defunct]] service created by [[Six Apart]] as part of its [[Final Solution|five-year plan]] to control the [[blog]]ging universe.  It was marketed as a [[LiveJournal]] for grown-ups.  Instead of pulling a Facebook and taking out LiveJournal.  Six Apart didn't think this one through, since they also owned LiveJournal as well, so for all purposes this was a planned an hero.  After selling off LiveJournal to Russians and launching both Vox and obtaining a Twitter-copy called Pownce, the company sank faster than the Titanic.  The first to go was Pownce, then Vox.  Now Six Apart is planning its next terrible blogging service, Type Pad, a knockoff of Tumblr.

Contrary to popular belief, Vox was the [[copypasta|same thing]] as LiveJournal. The only difference was that Vox looked like somebody took a big fat [[Web 2.0]] shit all over it.  Type Pad is expected to be LiveJournal with the Vox Web 2.0 shit all over it plus a huge dose of unfiltered hipster.

Thankfully, it closed on September 30th.

==Vox drama==
Months before its scheduled public launch in the fall of 2006, Vox already stirred up [[drama]]. Many users were upset over Six Apart's description of LiveJournal.  In the "About Vox" page, Six Apart originally wrote:

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">LiveJournal has grown to be an amazing community of fiercely independent bloggers, primarily teenagers and twenty-somethings.</blockquote>

While this was completely [[fact]]ual, many users who were past that age group felt [[offended|insulted]] and [[butthurt|slightly umamused]](and rightly so: how do they expect to be treated? They were using a site geared towards fucking [[teenager]]s!) Six Apart was forced to change the wording, which now reads: 

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">LiveJournal has grown to be an amazing community of fiercely independent [[blogger]]s. Over the past seven years, that community has developed in both its scope and its need for powerful customization.</blockquote>

==Vox invite codes==
Vox initially needed 'invite codes' though no one uses it.  It was a failed attempt to make the site "exclusive" to those who used it, turning much of the user base into snobby LiveJournal washouts.

==Tag clouds==
Vox, much like [[samefag|every other website]] to come into existence in recent years, featured the highly useless, and therefore trendy feature of tags. If you for some reason do not use tags, you [[srsly]] need to wake up, smell the [[cocaine|coffee]], and welcome yourself to the [[Y2K|21st century]], [[girlfriend]].

These were arranged in traditional "popular tags" clouds, on [http://www.vox.com/explore/posts/ various pages] throughout the site. The link text to these tags grew larger the more people are using that tag, which was really just [[asking for it]].

==Handicap Accessibility==
Vox was officially the first blog user interface designed for [[cripples|blind people]]. Most of the fonts are at least as big as the buttons on phones for blind, [[fat]], or old people. [[shit nobody cares about|There were lots of friendly colored boxes with arrows showing you where to type.]] Sometimes the site even tells you what to write:

==The Future==
Currently the staff at Six Apart is working on TypePad, which is just a hipster's version of Vox.  Note: There is already a hipster blogging site out there called Tumblr, apparently Six Apart never got the memo, or they are seriously attempting to make money of copypasta.  However most users of Vox aren't too keen on going over to TypePad...
