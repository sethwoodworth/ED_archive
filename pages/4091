:''This article is about the mythical currency. For [[IRL]] money, see [[Money]].

'''Internet money''' is a mystical entity.  Its users assume the word to be interchangeable with [[IRL]] money, even as they claim it to be worth [[at least 100]] times more. [[Internet]] money is almost always bandied about in Internet [[United States]] Dollars (E$).

Internet money includes things similar the fake merchandise credits at stores that list their retail price 10x what things are worth and oddly charge tax and shipping/handling even though it's supposed to be free, thus making the credit fake.  Another type of fake money is PayPal, where anyone sending money can press a button on paypal and instantly get their money back for up to two years.  Credit cards, when used over the internet, are also e-money -- a simple charge back is all it takes to reverse a transaction, once again proving how fake internet money really is.
