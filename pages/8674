Undo
[[Image:Blankfailure.gif|thumb|Say goodbye useless edits.]]	

'''Undo''' is a word many ED and Wikipedia vandals are familiar with, when they decide to make poor edits on an article that they get butthurt over because it is about their mom or some [[BayHorseCrew|Christian friend]] who decided to become a lesbian [[IDIFTL|for the lulz.]]

When admins or any other EDitor discovers [[BLANKING_IN_PROGRESS|blanking]] in progress, he or she simply reverts, or undoes the edit within about 3 seconds that a painful and [[TL;DR]] blank page has been written by a butthurt fan/[[lolcow]].

==Blanking==
Shown in the image above, blanking is not always simply deleting all text within a page, it is often when someone writes a useless complaint to ED in the best way to get yourself targeted for [[lol]]. [[Snapesnogger]] would be a fine example of a group of fans becoming unfathomably [[idiot|idiotic]] and trying to become [[an hero|an heros]] by taking it all away the hate from their master, but within the split second it takes any EDiot to press the undo button, all the heroism is [[COMBO_BREAKER|BROKEN]]
