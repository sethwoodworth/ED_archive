{{lj|duke_otterland}}, or as he is now known as '''Prince Jeremy of Britannia''' at {{lj|princejeremy}} (name changed in accordance to [[furry]] law 233263), is an [[autistic]], psychotic, winged purple otter with antlers.

No, really.

He also published a novel [[last Thursday]]. It is anticipated that the number of copies sold may reach double digits by 2010 if furries choose to do their Christmas shopping on Amazon.com after consuming excessive amounts of eggnog.

His latest capers include trying to blank this article, on December 13, 2006. On December 27th, it was also revealed that Prince Jeremy is a welfare leech, like the hypocrite that he is.

<blockquote>
17:47 <+DukeOtterland> No, I get Social Security.<br>
17:48 <+DukeOtterland> Because I'm considered disabled.
</blockquote>
</div>

== Childhood ==
Prince Jeremy's childhood and adolescence were marked by being an object of torment and ridicule, with other children being "disturbed by his graphic representations of cartoon animal sex." This necessitated the Prince attending [[at least 100]] different schools during his formative years. It was during this time that Prince Jeremy first discovered yiffy porn and began the manuscript that would later become his futuristic furry opus. In other words, Jeremy's childhood is a mirror image of fellow hypocrite 'artist' fucktard [[Dave Hopkins]].

The Prince appears to be partaking in an extended childhood as he still resides with his parents. One might even say he is regressing, given his admission of experimentation with diapering and infantilism.

== Politics ==
[[Image:Otterland moveon.jpg|thumb|right|Prince Jeremy's insightful commentary on Democrats]]
The Prince is a self-hating fur-fag and has embraced the ideology of his neocon oppressors, thanks to watching the propaganda super-patriot network [[Faux News|Fox News]]. He espouses extreme neoconservative viewpoints and endorses the delusional and incompetent policies of the [[W|Bush]] administration and the Republican party in general. This is understandable since he is from [[Texas]]. Most troubling is that, as an openly bisexual furry in a subculture with a large number of gays, he has [[irony|openly admitted to hating gays and opposing gay marriage]]. However, it should be known that, according to a study by the University of Georgia [http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_fuel2.htm], the vast majority of homophobes are in the closet themselves, and the Prince is no exception. 

[[Image:Dukecomment.jpg]]

In a characteristic display of hypocrisy, Otterland will leave angry and inflammatory comments on other user's LJs when he disagrees with their opinions on religion, politics, video games, and even grammar; however, it is verboten for people on his friends list to do the same.

== Autism ==
The Prince states that no one should be allowed to disagree with him in any way because he is [[autistic]] and [[emo|easily upset]]. He doesn't see his autism as a disability so much as a justification for poor impulse control and a [[In the ass|''carte-blanche'' excuse]] for a terminal case of foot-in-mouth disease.

The Furry Autistic Internet Livejournalers community has issued a blanket statement disavowing any association with Prince Jeremy and condemning his representation of furry autistics.[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v293/lilywhitemm/bannedsmall.jpg AVOID AT ALL COSTS]

[[Image:Article1.jpg|left|thumb|Lol internet poor.]]
[[Image:Article2.jpg|left|thumb]]

== Sexuality ==
[[Image:MuzzOtterland.jpg|right|thumb|100px|I'm 2 sexy 4 my antlers.]]
Prince Jeremy is a case study in sexual deviance and living proof that [[User:Miltopia|prolonged virginity causes unnatural desires]].

The Prince's ideal mate would be a [[Mexican|sombrero wearing, cigar smoking,]] gay furry in diapers. No word yet on whether the Prince pitches or catches. ([[PROTIP]]: He's single, boys. Get 'im while it's hot.)
THIS JUST IN: Prince admits to wishing to be a CATCHER!

=== Furry ===
[[Image:DukeKissColor.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Homosexual Otterpr0n.]]
Prince Jeremy's fursona is a purple otter with wings and antlers. In a world teeming with varicolored wolves, foxes, and an assortment of large cats, it is refreshing to see an otter. [http://www.adn.com/evos/photos/evos29l.jpg  Oil slicks love otters.] While the Prince currently makes do with commissioned art depicting his fursona, he is eagerly awaiting the completion and delivery of his first fursuit. 
This just in&mdash;the fursuit is now complete, & it's every bit as wonderful as people expected it to be!
[[Image:Wholesuit.jpg|thumb|100px|Is this even an otter? Whatever it is, look closely and you'll see the furfag is wearing Chris-Chan's bra.]]

===FREE ART, ZOMG, GIMME!===
[[Image:Prince Jeremy Free Art Whore.jpg|thumb|Free art for duke! drawn by {{lj|anjel_kitty}}]]

Duke is an avid art whore, scouring any art site or lj community for any instance that an artist may be giving away free art, then jumps it, wanting to get more art of his hideously deformed character. Most people are too nice to say 'fuck off' and draw him, but others think 
differently:
*''fuck duke. He's permabanned from all my communities. Don't worry about him joining any time soon.''
*''guess im evil I wont do art of his charater for $$ and certainly not for free x.x* 
''
*''I both dislike and laugh at how Duke went through the troubles of changing his livejournal (and identity, sort of) yet he appears at the same places when he gets the smell of free drawings.  Then people whine how wrong it is for people to post links to Duke's new journal, because he's avoiding people. Yeah, right. >_>''
*''he pestered me for gift art when he was on my fl. He un friended me because I said I would only draw a winged purple gay pedo otter for 150 dollars, and that would be the cost for a sketch. colored would be 300 dollars. He snags free art because not many people have the balls to say fuck you. That and not many people are keen on taking commissions from him after what he did to harli.''- {{lj|lougaraswifthrt}}
*''The only way I would ever work for him in a commission is for $300+ for a sketch, and upwards of that for anything else. I've read the stories about how he is with commissions...''
**''amen to that. i'd fucking send him anthrax in the damn mail instead of a sketch.'' - reply from {{lj|lougaraswifthrt}}
=== Infantilism ===
[[Image:Babyfurduke.jpg|right|thumb|Despite his hatred of homos, Prince secretly indulges in [[Babyfur]] faggotry.]]
[[Image:Dukehomo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Self Hating Homophobe Much?]]
The Prince has incorporated diapering into his fur fetish. His initial excuse, and the one he provides to his parents, is that he is experimenting for practical reasons as his fursuit will make bathroom visits tedious and complicated affairs. Later he grudgingly acknowledged that [[babyfur]] play arouses him.

=== Other Deviances ===
Not content with just being a diapered fursuiter, Prince Jeremy has opted to also be a cross-dressing bisexual zoophile with a penchant for funny hats and carcinogenic addictions.

It is not known whether he gets the necessary foundation garments for his homespun otter-drag from [[Chris-Chan]] or his mother.

He posts on RPGamer and acts like he has been around for [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100 years]] and tries to [[Fellatio|suck off]] the admin. When he gets [[flame wars|flamed]] he cries to and threatens a [[mod]] that he'll post evidence of them having [[gay|gay sex]] and get the person [[banhammer|banned]].

== Org's Odyssey ==
The Prince has written a [[old media|book]], published by some godawful [[internets]] [[vanity press]], about his fursona's adventure in a [[gay|mystical]] land. Or some furry shit. In fact, [[noone|almost noone]] actually knows what happens in this book minus [[God]] and the Prince because [[noone|almost noone]] is willing to shell out <strike>18 dollars</strike> 5 dollars for [[shit nobody cares about|some furry book]]. One only hopes that [[/b/]] can valiantly obtain a copy and post it so that much [[lulz]] can be enjoyed by teh [[internets]].  However, it is rumored that the book contains monochromic anthropomorphs, multiple instances of nudity, several references to pedophilia, monotonous re-occurring dinner scenes, and the most undramatic rushed fight scene endings ever.

=== Reviews ===
[[Image:Otterland_says_buy_my_book.jpg|right|thumb|Prince Jeremy fails at finding buyers for his book.]]

'''Entertaining but for all the wrong reasons.'''
Org is some sort of Legendary Hero, and his world Anglia (England as the "Ancient race" knew it) is slowly being consumed by Evil and Darkness. Seven bat-winged Satans (symbolising the seven deadly sins) are at large and against them must stand... Seven bird-winged seraphim, to be lead by the pure white otter, Org, with his deer antlers, dolphin tail and gills. Follow Org's adventures as he travels Anglia, seeking the other heirs and paying more attention to how much things cost and eating nothing but fish rather then facing any real threats... - Raynflower

'''THE WORST'''
This is pretty much the worst book I have ever read. It makes no sense and rambles on about things like how furries and humans get into these thunderdome type wrestling matches and then the humans eat the furrie/antro creatures. They roast them over some kind of spit. I find this absolutely SHAMEFUL! No one should eat furries or antropods of any kind. The way this book is so insensitive to the trial of the furries is an abomination!!! I won't stand for it. - [[Girlvinyl]]

'''Bafflingly Inappropriate'''
This astonishing book raised a few questions with me, to say the least. These concerns can however be focussed mainly into asking why the author felt the need to cram sex scenes into every available orifice (no pun intended). I mean, surely five pages of the winged dolphin otter sodomising a chameleon was extraneous? There was no mention of any type of sexual relationship between the two either before or after this scene, and it had no bearing on the rest of the story. To say it was tacked-on is an understatement.
I would also like to say that I calculated that there is on average a reference to inter-species sex (primarily sodomy or coprophilia) once every four pages throughout the novel. In fact, I would estimate that these actstake up a good third of the books in total. I must ask; how is this even remotely appropriate? - PeyoteCapote

'''It didn't make me blind, but I wish it had'''
This book, while off to a promising start when it discusses deviant sexual behavior in all caps between furry-type creatures, ultimately disappoints. Its typeface is too small, and I don't appreciate the tacit promotion of homosexual marriage presented in the subtext of one of the plot's many branches. The author's agenda is all too obvious, if you're willing to read between the lines. And the asterisks. - LemonSawdust

'''Why?'''
Honestly, I try not to review things that I don't finish-- but this book was awful. His style lacks anything even remotely close to maturity. I got about forty pages in before being flat out disgusted by his poor editing and boorish storytelling abilities.

I wish I could give less than one star. - Ruby Chiarito

'''Anciously awaiting the Sequel!!'''

[[lie|As soon as I opened this book I couldn't get enough. I felt as if it spoke directly to my heart.

You see, having been molested as a child, I too can relate to the trials and tribulations of Org and his family. I learned at a young age that only by latching onto things like stuffed animals of my early childhood and deviant sexual urges stemming from isolation a lack of self esteem due to the horrible abuses heaped upon me could I become a whole and healthy person.

I feel that Duke Otterland understands this as well, and perhaps only through this heartfelt testimony of the triumph of the human/animal spirit do I believe that many more people like he and I can begin to heal.

So thank you, Duke Otterland. Thank you.]] - [[Duke_Otterland|M. Grandi "ContemplativeSoul"]]

'''Oh good god why.'''
I thought that this was a joke. My sister of 14 years old came home with this trash. So after seeing this page, I thought "hey who knows, maybe this was a little too harsh on the book. I'll read it." But I was wrong. DEAD WRONG. So I couldn't even get past 50 pages. I reported the book to the school. and they let me keep the book. I did the best thing that I could do, and burned it.

Humanity became a joke after this book. - Neil Burns (Verbose_neil- Meep277)  



Oh, and [http://www.amazon.com/review/R26SRC39UNN7V3/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm/ this] is probably a troll but it's [[lulz|fucking hilarious]].

==Prince Jeremy's newest opus==
[[Image:newreview.jpg|right|thumb|The press can't get enough of this charmer!]]
Prince Jeremy recently came out with another installment of [[bullshit|his book]], also available on [[vanity press|Lulu]]. 

''Judge of Stellasolum'', the title of this [[abortion|gem of literary effort]] will undoubtedly [[fail]] upon release, but then again Prince Jeremy isn't the [[unrealistic expectations|most sensible of people]].

== Trolling the "Prince" ==

[[Image:trolldukeotterland.jpg|right|thumb|Here's how to properly troll Prince Jeremy.]]
[[Image:Dukeotterland_FA_message.png|right|thumb|This was just begging to be posted to ED. Also, [[Harry Potter|quoting fictional characters from kid's books]] totally proves liberals and atheists are evil. Totally.]]

Here is how an argument with Prince Jeremy proceeds:
*Responds to your comment
*Posts a comment in your journal
*Deletes your original comment, his replies and his posts in your journal.
*Bans you from his journal.
*Claims E-Victory

Then he will insult your art after he has commissioned you for some and requests a refund. In this situation, it's best to just deny him the art and the refund, but oddly enough, sometimes a few minutes later he claims the art is fine and he wants it again. Again, denial is the best way to deal with this.

===A Lulzy [[anecdotal evidence|Anecdote]]===

[[At least 100 years ago|A few years ago]], Prince Jeremy made friends with a certain non-furry who was sad and depressed because of her [[rape|poor marriage]] -- that is to say, he befriended her on his LJ, and commented on [[Internet stalking|everything she ever posted]]. 

To cheer her up, he e-mailed her a [[pain series|hideous picture]] of [[shitting dick nipples|a naked ferret with tits fingering herself]]. What made this so remarkable was that he had actually ''drawn it himself''.  This image greatly disturbed the young woman, but she didn't know how to approach him about it. 

After all, what would ''[[you]]'' [[Suicide|do if something like that happened?]] 

Well, a friend of this poor woman took it upon himself to tell him to "[[GTFO|fucking cut it out]], you fucking sicko." He responded by posting on his LJ about how [[shit nobody cares about|everything he ever tries to do to help people only makes him unliked]], eventually turning into a rant about how [[CP|his mommy hated him as a child]]. 

This, he explains, is the [[bullshit|precise reason]] he became the [[babyfur|diaper-wearing]] [[furvert]] he is today.

==Choice quotes==

* "People like you are the cancer of the earth and should be thrown into concentration camps. I voted for [[W]] and the ban on gay marriage here in [[Texas]]. Fuck all the assholes who hate him."
* "Dislikes: -Politics ... -[[Irony|Hypocrites]] ... -Unconstructive, uncivil debate"  Funny how he seems to be quite involved with each of those on a daily basis.
* "Anyway, there are two rules for me Friending you, Friending me, and commenting in my LJ: -ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY NO FLAMING! Being [[autistic]], I am far more [[BAWWWWW|sensitive than most]] others, and thus have a fairly broad definition of flaming. Flaming, to me, includes things such as destructive criticism, uncivil debate, slander, vicious attacks against certain people and groups, insults against people I admire, games and other things I like, my beliefs, and my accomplishments (which includes my reviews and other writing). So *be civil*." ''He also states that saying you don't like President Bush or that you don't believe in God is a "vicious attack and slander".''
*"No one can make me feel inferior without my consent, and I'll do you the same." ''OH NOES!!! XD''
*"I'm pretty much set in my beliefs (being autistic makes it very, very difficult for me to keep an open mind to uncivil opinion, by the way), so please don't poke me the wrong way, okay?" ''Yeah, right.''
*"When I do muse about politics in my LJ, I will disable comments because I believe I'm entitled to my opinion and that you're entitled to yours."
*"You can't even stand up to the fucking extremists on the Left. Even Albus Dumbledore said, 'It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, and a great deal more to stand up to your friends.' You're nothing more than an elitist left-wing dick, [[Defriend|and I never, ever, ever want to speak with you again]]." Wait, wasn't Dumbledore gay?

[[Image:Duke_babyfur_flounce.gif|right|thumb|The complete email, which Duke filed a fraudulent DMCA claim against.]]
Selected quotes from an email January 8, 2009, where Prince Jeremy said...

{{quote3|our friendship has become very, very strained, as a result of your contribution to Encyclopedia Dramatica ... and truth is no defense for invasion of privacy, of which Encyclopedia Dramatica is nothing short of guilty. Encyclopedia Dramatica, as you may know, is a viscerally anti-furry site, so by allying with them, you have basically made a deal with the devil, and have basically hung yourself, being the head of a prominent furry fetish community.}}

ED's anti-furry?  But ED let [[Thedreadedkettle|a furry who donated to WikiFur]] become a sysop.


{{quote3|as far as I'm concerned, diaper-soiling and the furry fandom go together as well as a fish and a bicycle. In an episode of "King of the Hill," Hank Hill tells a Christian rocker, "Can't you see you're not making Christianity better? You're making rock and roll worse!" Thus, I believe that you are not making the furry fandom or babyfurs look better, but that you are making adult babies and other fetishists look worse, not to mention the furry community itself.}}

True, mixing adult babies with furries does make adult babies look worse.  However, he's wrong about "diaper-soiling and the furry fandom" not going together and the image below is proof:
[[Image:Holychristfurfags.jpg|400px|none]]



{{quote3|Also know that I am not a furry anymore. It was because of my negative experiences in the fandom, and because of folks such as yourself, that made me retire all my fursonas and withdraw from the community entirely. I still really love anthro art, and occasionally do anthro art and writing, but liking anthro art doesn't make me a furry anymore}}

Really loving anthro art and writing makes one a furry.  Denying it also makes one a [[closet furry]].

GoDaddy explained that there wasn't any legal precedent for a DMCA claim towards E-mails and other direct forms of communication, but that they were just going with the flow and following the DMCA rules regarding claims.

Anon was able to obtain Jeremy's home phone number to try and contact him to resolve the issue.

==Education==
The Prince [http://en.wikifur.com/w/index.php?title=Jeremy,_the_Duke_of_Otterland&diff=82509&oldid=82508 claims] to be very highly educated, with no less than 4 degrees:
 <blockquote>I've also gotten four Computer Science Associate Degrees and Certifications from Central Texas College, 
 and am working on a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering from Tarleton State University at Central Texas.</blockquote>

That's rather amazing for someone who graduated from [[Nobody Cares|Copperas Cove High School]] just 7 years ago in 2002.  It is currently unknown if his 4 "Computer Science Associate Degrees and Certifications" are actually accredited by [[Meatspin.com|The Texas Board of Education]], or [[Vomit|not]].


==New Account and 'Galleries'==

Apparently The Prince is trying to start anew- or get the trolls off his gay purple back- with a new account and equally gay new fursona, a harecat- half cat half hare- still purple, still gay, and still whoring for free art.
His attempts at thwarting the EDiots and /b/tards can be found here:

*http://jeremiasvk.livejournal.com/profile Newest incarnation.
*http://jmgreviews.wikidot.com/ [[shit nobody cares about|His opinions]] about videogames, also about people who have opinions about videogames.  Or something.

It seems as though the Prince is still [[gay|alive]] and well.

== Duke and The [[Lol|Law]] ==

=== CEASE AND DESIST ORDER ===

You think he'd have learned by now, but he's now sending out [[legal threats]] via years-old LJ comments. To wit:

        Jerry Gallen
        2401 Veterans Ave.
        Copperas Cove, TX 76522
        
        <font size="+3">[[Serious Business|URGENT]]</font>
        
        Dear Andrew,
        
        Re: Your Repeated Harassment
        
        It has come to my attention that you have attempted repeated communication with me despite [[butthurt|my constant admonishments]]
        not to do so, and have [[IDIFTL|acted as a double agent]] for [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], libeling me on the site in violation of 
        [[lulz|cyberstalking]] laws [[Texas|Tx.]] [[Penis|Penal]] Code § 42.07 and [[E-lawyer|New York Penal Law § 240.30]].
        
        [[You]] have ten days to [[ALL CAPS|CEASE AND DESIST]] your repeated harassment of me.
        
        Failing this, I will [[Internet lawsuit|apply for an injunction]], and will seek to [[unrealistic expectations|recover damages (plus interest)]] for 
        your tortious acts and conduct.
        
        This is my [[serious business|final communication]] to you on this matter, and [[LOL WUT|I look forward to hearing from you as a matter of urgency]].
        
        [[gay|Yours]] faithfully,
        [[Faggot|Jerry Gallen]]

I am [[truth|not making this up]], he really wrote this. He has a thing for trying to communicate with people by means to which they cannot reply, such as private messages on [[FurAffinity]] when he has pre-emptively blocked the user (you'd think that FA would not allow users to send PMs to those on their blocklist to prevent exactly this kind of behavior, but apparently Dragoneer [[skript kiddie|is a better programmer than we thought]]), and he replies to LJ comments and then deletes them, preventing any replies. Oh, and by the way, he (under his new account {{furaffinity|kingodin|kingodin}}) [[cuntpaste]]d this same text into a FurAffinity PM, showing that while the Duke may come up with [[over 9000]] new aliases every year, a [[faggot]] doesn't change their stripes that easily.
