Apathy Dog
{{WP80navsmall}}
Apathy Dog is the [[btard|fucked up]] cousin of the [[Advice Dog]]. Apathy Dog is a [[fail]]ure because /b/tards have no grasp of the English language, and failing to understand the difference between [[apathy]] and being [[emo]], created a sniveling faggot  '''Prozac Pooch''' (or [[Emo Dog]]).

In Apathy Dog's defense, it actually requires a touch of creativity. To reach a finished product, you must add captions to the [[Oh Exploitable]] macro in the time honored tradition of /b/ by firing up [[MS Paint]] (or sticking it in ROFLbot) instead of lazily using the Advice Dog generator with all its limits. This is especially true when an Advice Dog [[macro]] is juxtaposed with an Apathy Dog macro to form a single macro; this is the first sign of [[original content]] in months.  In addition, Apathy Dog, when done right, is often painfully funny and even poignant.
