AOL
[[Image:Aol_dog.jpg|thumb|AOL is loved by all species.]]

Stands for "[[American]] Offline," and is sometimes referred to as "[[AOHell]]", "gAyOL","LOL", or "my shitty [[internets]]." One of the last surviving online services from the pre-home internet days. It originally offered an entire online system with limited internet access. Today it offers banal, mainstream content for an exorbitant fee and few  useful features. It creates a warm, fuzzy, safe-feeling environment for those who fear being on the [[internets]] alone.

An irony about AOL is its creation and ownership of the [[AOL Instant Messenger]] system which is heavily used by many people who have a vehement hatred for AOL the ISP, but don't hesitate to use the AOL IM feature as it is so ubiquitous amongst internet users that there is almost no escaping it. In other words, you hate AIM but have to use it because all of your friends are too stupid to use anything better. Also, AIM is guaranteed to make your computer 100% slower.

When AOL is referred to as an ISP, this is somewhat incorrect, AOL is actually considered a "content provider" as opposed to an [[Internets|Internet]] access provider. This is due to the fact that you must read at least a nominal part of AOL content before being given access to the raw [[Internet]].  But no one gives a shit.

AOL will never stop billing your credit card. ''Never.''

AOL was once the world's only source of 3.5" floppy disks. When they went to CD for distribution, they went out of business.

== AOL and AOLd People ==

[[Image:AOL subscriber fail.png|thumb|brb subscribers]]
No less than 100% of AOL users are either [[Republican|over the age of 68]], Niggers, or <s>trailer trash pieces of shit that can only afford their electricity by selling meth on their front porch</s> [[White trash|True Americans]]. These people rely on free AOL CDs and rip-off service charges to get their [[Pr0n]]. AOL will make your computer move slower than [[Smegma|Ronald McDonald's arteries]]. Anyone with a brain and more than twenty minutes of experience with the interwebs knows that joining AOL is on par with [[suicide]]. [[Fact|57% of the holes in the ozone layer are directly connected to the burning of AOL disks]] in various places, such as campgrounds, Jew and hobo fires. AOL is also the #1 cause of [[Africa|Cancer, AIDS, Polio, Influenza, Bubonic Plague, Malaria, Ebola, Cholera, and Smallpox]].

== AOL CDs ==
[[Image:AOL larper.jpg|thumb|AOL discs make great wuss armor.]]
Back in the day when AOL was the predominant Dial-up host, they offered these wonderful [[CD]]s to '''everyone'''. People soon found that these round plastic disks offered more fun than AOL could ever offer. Below are some usages of the disks that anyone living in the [[United States]] is bound to have laying around:

# Coasters
# Frisbee
# Fly Swatter
# [[Ninja]] Stars
# Target Practice with Pellet guns
# Monster Rancher monsters
# Hood / rear-view mirror ornaments
# Inserting into anal passages
# Decapitating pigeons
# A castration device
# Leveling furniture
# Pooper scooper
# The next Boston bomb scare
# Pizza cutters
# Microwave electric light show
# Pizza Cutter
...and Many more!

==So you got the sack?==
At the start of August 2006 after a frankly hilarious drop of about 16 million (lol, 50%) of the used since AOL's plateau, their huge fetid cock swung into action cutting 5,000 jobs worldwide while mumbling about its move from service provider to go and powder its nose. On 4th August foul noises were heard coming from the corner office at [http://corp.aol.com/ AOHell] HQ, most people believe this was the sound of Jonathan Miller (CEO) sucking Satan's cock, Amen. Concurrently, on a lower floor at the same location and at the exact same time a grateful soon-to-be ex employee was about to release the results of 500,000 AOL user searches in to the wild, amen again. Much [[lulz]] ensued after some geeks actually trawled the ten 200 MB .tex files and posted the most interesting finds around the internets. <s>These go from the [http://www.aolsearchdatabase.com/search.php?textfield=521960&textfield2=&textfield4=&sort=date desperate], to the [http://www.aolsearchdatabase.com/search.php?textfield=336865&textfield2=&textfield4=&sort=date fully insane], typifying most AOL'ers mental states</s>(404). Also AOL are now to offer free domain names to anyone that wants one. So they can now be the proud owner of the one you find and squat. AOLism, you're not alone.

==AOL was where everyone ran to==

AOL was many people's first foray into the Internet.  Because of this, the AOL Tech Support went nuts trying to keep up.

==AOL as a great tool for [[vandalism]]==
[[Image:Kill AOL.jpg|thumb|Show the world how you feel about AOL... or at least the driver behind you.]]
AOL's system of changing IP addresses guarantees that if a wiki bans one person, they ban a lot.  Also since your IP changes all the time, you can't be tracked down by your IP. [[Willy on Wheels]] used this to his advantage in vandalism.

== AOL is now free ==
Goodbye AOL CDs. AOL has decided to offer its service free of charge to users who already have a high speed internet connection. Those still on dial-up will continue to pay a fee to use the AOL service. However, subscribers to the "AOL for Broadband" service, where you bring your own high-speed internet connection to the party, will no longer have to pay subscription fees. This will result in a projected 2 billion dollar loss in revenue for the company and will hopefully lead to their demise. 

AOL will also not continue to offer their customer support to these customers, eliminating their iron fisted TOS system and giving [[noobs]] and [[16 year old girls]] everywhere a chance to really express themselves with talk of [[dead babies]] and use of the words [[fuck]] and [[ass]]. This change in policy will of course also crush the soul of [[your mom]], taking away her ability to stick it to the man by stealing paid services from AOL using fake names and credit cards. 

Of course, no one cares because everyone who uses AOL is a [[furry]]. Fuck AOL. 

== AOL Speak ==
You're supposed to talk in all caps if you use AOL.  It's part of their [[TOS]].  All users of AOL are 12 year old l337 wannabees.  This is [[Fact|FACT]].  Take this article for example, rendered in AOL:
