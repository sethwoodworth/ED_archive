Texture hacking or better know as '''Texture Faggotry''' or '''Texturefag''', is a new kind of low on the [[internets]] that involves basement dwellers recoloring video game graphics. Texture faggotry is usually [[Fellatio|performed]] by [[Loser|super-skilled hackers]] to change the appearance of something or someone in a [[Shit|video game]]. It all started because [[Sonic]]fags were [[butthurt]] that [[Nintendo]] didnâ€™t make [[gay|Shadow the Hedgehog]] or their other [[fetish]] as a playable character in [[Super Smash Bros]]. Another popular example would be texture hacking [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] and turn the already gay Sonic into their beloved [[Original character|buttbaby]]. Basically texturefags are indeed basement dwelling losers with too much time.


==]EE[==
Once known as Ghosteo, ]EE[ were the first fags to start partaking in such a shitty activities. They were an elitist group who thought they were good, due to [[lie | being the first group of texture fags]]. This gave them the false belief that they were better then everyone else, however, despite most texturefags being shit, they still weren't able to be the [[winnar|best]]. After a few months, the head honch Ghosteo decided to be a [[retard]] and abandon the group. He was then impersonated [[at least 100|many]] times, which heavily tarnished his [[e-peen|reputation]].After [[Over 9000 | many]] weeks,on the day of the texture release, Nintendo flew down from the sky and [[banhammer | B&]] them from releasing there textures. This caused them severe butthurt, however the rest reveled in their [[pain]] and [[lulz|pointed and laughed]]. Their textures included shit for [[Narutard | Narutards]],supporting characters from [[lie |popular games ]], and [[furry]] versions of every character. [[Srsly]].

==StackSmash==
The second [[lie | "well known"]] group of texture fags is called '''StackSmash'''. Despite [[greed|not releasing]] anything except pix to their hordes of fans, everyone loves them and their constantly expanding group. By the time you look back, they have 10 new members. Like most groups, the leader and founder can't actually do anything, but texturefags are poor, so they have to follow a [[Rich and beautiful|rich person]] in order to be able to afford hosting.

Members of StackSmash

==Shittykorp==
"We're just <s> badace </s> <s>bad</s>ass. An insult to the other fags for practising the same art.Everyone in this group is a [[Furry | furfag]]. 90% of their posts are apologies for not updating or <b> absolutely shit </b> textures. The only reason they have "fans" is that they actually released there shit, all of which was [[cuntpaste | cuntpasted ]] from some other site. The former leader, TeadyMKII had to leave due to having a teenage child with Raganook, the leader of ]EE[, after they met during a [[camwhore | camwhoring]] session. At one point people thought they were about to release a good texture for once, but actually the big [[surprise]] was that they got a new member,[[fag | Supercoins]], who released an [[lie | absolutely brilliant]] [[shit | Barney the Dinosaur texture]].[[At least 100 | A couple of]] weeks later they died.

==EliteSmashHacked==
One of many groups to jump on the bandwagon, with a free wordpress blog. However, after post after post of [[Shit nobody cares about]], someone was fucking sensible and [[hacked]] their retarded site. The hack caused the site to have all of its posts deleted, however, the hacker was obviously a fucking [[retard]] because they were able to recover the pictures within hours. But the comments that they and the public made were gone forever. The list of suspects is: Eddie, TeadyMKII, [[Anonymous]], [[Nintendo]], and [[Fucktard | BigSharkZ]] (the leader).

==ShittyCorp and FurfagMix==
After a while StackSmash's [[Lie | leader]] [[Wanker | PZT]] decided that it would be pretty [[Fail | cool]] to go out and dominate the world of texture hacks by merging with [[Furfag | MeowMix]] for the [[lulz | lulz]]. However [[Furfag | MeowMix]] decided that it would be really cool to instead merge with [[Furfag | KittyCorp]] the result is most members not giving a fuck and PZT being [[butthurt]]. The merge of ShittyCorp and FurfagMix is known as "KittyCorp: MeowMix", [[Lie | which is a true original and good name]]. Known more commonly as "KC:MM", they are known for being the leaders of the [[Furfag]] army that invades the [[Lie | pretty awesome and good]] [[Shit | community]]. They are also well known for posting [[Lie | very good texture hacks every day]] and because they have a [[Lie | pretty]] [[shit | good]] [[fail | forum]]. Contains a lot of [[Fail | dipshits]] who either cry for attention with their [[shit | Shadow recolors]] or request for nude textures of [[Wanker | Olimar]]. There is also an [[Lie | awesome]] thread in the [[Shit | forum]] known as "KC:MM Family", where role playing as furries is [[Gay | cool]] and fads include [[Gay | awesome]] video game personas and flashy colors.
