'''Drawbunny-chan''' is a [[drawhore]] from [[4chan]]'s [[b|/b/]]. Starting an [[epic]] thread with a picture of a bunny drinking lemonade and announcing that she's a [[girl]], /b/tards quickly stormed her with requests. Her [[win]] was cut short unfortunately, but she promised to return.<br/>Drawbunny-chan has since returned a few times during low activity.
