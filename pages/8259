The LiveJournal Advisory Board Election
[[Image:Cambler- I Am Withdrawing From The Election.png|thumb|250px|center|HOLY SHIT DEATH THREATS]]
The '''Livejournal Advisory Board''' is a board of users responsible for giving advice to the [[Russia|Soviets]] on [[shit nobody cares about|what makes effective Livejournal policy]]. Members of the board include {{lj|danahboyd}} and [[bradfitz|The Brad]], who has been facing public pressure to step down as puppet dictator since the removal of [[Basic accounts]] and the following [[The Great Livejournal Content Strike of 2008|Content Strike]].

In [[Last Thursday|May 2008]], SUP announced that they were opening seats on the board to the general userbase. 


==The Nominations are Open==
After proving that the duties of the board are completely irrelevant, Livejournal owners SUP decided that creating new seats that [[Anonymous|John Q. User]] could run for would be a good P.R. move. This has already proven frighteningly effective, with people of all [[Communist|stripes]], black person, [[gay|orientations]] and [[Computer Science III|education levels]] throwing their hats into the ring.

The nominations were opened in early May, with a [http://community.livejournal.com/lj_election_en/ brand new community] created just for the occasion. The rules for running were as follows:

* You must [[masturbate|nominate yourself]].
* You must have [[at least 100]] comments of [[sock journal|support]].

==DRAMA unfolds==
On May 22nd, the election was opened for anyone who had an account prior to March 11th, and people who use OpenID. 
[[Image:LMM will not resign.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Legomymalfoy will not resign from [[LJ Abuse]] if elected even though it would present a definite conflict of interest.]][[Image:Seizurethemoment.gif|right|Vote Jameth!]]
In events which shocked no one, active campaigns were launched by the candidates and their supporters, who in some cases marshaled hundreds of sockpuppets to go vote.  It became quickly apparent that although there are many candidates, the two primary candidates are {{lj|jameth}} and {{lj|legomymalfoy}}. [[Jameth]] is of course widely known, legomymalfoy less so -- but is known in fandom as the LJ Abuse member who sold out fandom during the [[Strikethrough]]. 

This [http://jameth.livejournal.com/4349665.html post] from {{lj|jameth}} about possible ballot-stuffing starts the whole thing off - replete with accusations regarding {{lj|jameth}}'s newest campaign icon triggering seizures in epileptics.   Supporters of both candidates being called trolls and accusations of smear campaigns on both sides. The "sleeping giant" of fandom being awake.

By Monday, May 26th, {{lj|legomymalfoy}} was in the lead. But this was not enough for {{lj|bookshop}}, aka Aja, [http://bookshop.livejournal.com/892997.html who firmly believes] that {{lj|jameth}} is a tremendous menace to LJ, and encourages everyone to spam the fandom Livejournal communities on {{lj|legomymalfoy}}'s behalf.  Eventually there is the requisite deletion of comments and [http://bookshop.livejournal.com/892997.html?thread=32074821#t32074821 thread freezing] once {{lj|jameth}} shows up. And as predictably, there is [http://bookshop.livejournal.com/892997.html?thread=32082757#t32082757 a Godwin violation].

[[Weev]] commented that the only way to overcome this lead was to seek the endorsement of [[ohnotheydidnt]], [http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/23880308.html which was successfully sought after on May 26th] and a surge was seen in voting as Jameth chipped away at {{lj|legomymalfoy}}'s lead. Accusations of cheating and assorted malfeasance continued to fly back and forth across the entire site, which amused everyone who didn't think the board seat would be anything but a way to placate those users who scream incredibly loudly each time something on the site changes. 

For at least one <strike>of those users</strike> guy, the election was <strike>OMG SERIOUS</strike> [[lol]] enough to '''''[http://cambler.livejournal.com/949997.html?style=mine make credible death threats against legomymalfoy, jameth and cambler.]''''' 

 I didn't think it could get worse
 Seriously, I thought this election couldn't get worse.
 
 It has.
 
 I will have an announcement at noon, Pacific time. LJ has asked that I keep something confidential. 
 I have notified them that I am not comfortable with that, and have asked them to provide me with a 
 statement I can share, or I will have to explain myself. I asked them to do this by noon, Pacific 
 time, as I don't feel comfortable waiting longer than that.

 10:50AM - Response from LJ to my request for a statement was, essentially, "no."

 I reiterated that I feel forced to take action on my own by noon.

Currently, it is only known that [[LJ Abuse]] member and staff {{lj|marta}} sent an email informing Jameth and  Cambler that death threats had been made against their persons on or around May 26th. There <strike>are no</strike> is one known suspect(s) at this time, but <strike>it is believed that [[batshit]] crazy members of fandom are likely to blame.</strike> we're not telling.

==The Results==
[[image:exile.jpg|thumb|right|2008: Nevar forget]]
[[image:RPVote.jpg|thumb|right|One vote to rule them all.]]
As of May 30, 2008 the election results were announced. SUP named {{lj|legomymalfoy}} as the winner with 48.8% of the overall vote.[http://community.livejournal.com/lj_research/33025.html#cutid1] Yes, even with her sockpuppet army she [[epic fail|couldn't get a majority of the votes in the election]]. Jameth fanboys and fangirls screamed fraud, watchers on the sideline bust a gut, fandom pedophiles bust a nut, and everyone else [[irony|pats themselves on the back for their proud but futile move against censorship by electing someone who screens and bans their opponents]].

GG, LIVEJOURNAL.

===Comments from our newly elected by fraud===
on her current lj page

http://legomymalfoy.livejournal.com/587754.html

Based on comments and emails I've been receiving, it seems I've left some questions unanswered. 

I cannot and do not promise to answer everything, nor do I promise to allow myself and my friends to be badgered in comments. 

I was elected to advise LiveJournal on future changes/enhancements to the site and any policy changes; I was not elected to take abuse from anyone, nor will I willingly accept any. You are welcome to comment, but it should be clear to everyone by this point that I don't respond to trolls. If this is what started the 'why is she so quiet?!' questions, I do apologize. I just did not see how any good could come of me playing troll hockey. 

That said, feel free to leave any questions you may have. All comments are screened, and questions will be answered in a post to come in a few days.

Legomymalfoy will ban [[you|anyone]] who calls her out on her numerous ethical and conflict of interest issues.
