Whether it is [[Nazi|German's]] making nuclear bombs, or [http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/health/2009/07/15/2009-07-15_urine_power_hydrogen_produced_from_urea_could_be_used_to_power_cars_houses.html cars that run on piss], science is always bringing us new and exciting technology. But sometimes, that technology will make an abomination. An abomination the likes of which the world has never seen before. Starting out somewhere on the [[*chans]], '''What has science done?''' has become a somewhat common phrase to use when referring to an unusual or extraordinary creation, purportedly made by science, and leaving the repercussions of said creation on the heads of the innocent humans.

As you can see from the previous examples, science has provided pretty much nothing beneficial to humanity. The most useless of entities in modern day being the scientific process, which lets nothing but biased research based on "facts" through its seething hivemind. Many argue that this scientific process is what is truly responsible for the atrocities of the world. Those people would be correct. 

The only way we can combat Science and the things that it has done is to educate people. Introduce your children to Jesus Christ our lord and savior and we just might have a chance against science.
