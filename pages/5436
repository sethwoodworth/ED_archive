'''Mission: MySpace''' <s>is</s> <s>was</s> <s>is</s> WAS a notorious [[MySpace]] profile best known as a source of [[anti-lulz]] and a [[pain series|pain]] in the [[ass]] for all [[troll]]s. As of [[last Thursday]], Mission: MySpace has [[Murder|killed]] [[Over 9000|over 7000]] [[Pedo|innocent MySpace users']] profiles, which is the [[Shit nobody cares about|MySpace record]]. (He really has a life, [[amirite]]??) (Actually, [[some argue]] he does - apparently, he's a party [[furry|animal]]) The profile's creator is a 21-year-old [[faggot]] named Rob, who is commonly known as the king of MySpace [[internet humanitarian]]s and lives in [[Seattle]]. Best known for hunting [[sick fuck]]s and [[porn]]o bots, Mission: MySpace keeps the MySpace community clean, [[lulz]]-free, and full of [[fail]]. Oh wait, MySpace does a good enough job of that [[Self pwn|by itself]] without this [[homo]] [[Lurker|lurking]] on it. Mission: MySpace is similar to the [[YouTube Vigilantes]] in nature, but there's only [[lonely|one]] [[basement dweller|person]] behind this effort.

==History==

Mission: MySpace was originally created in [[At least 100 years ago|November 2006]] as "iReport Pornography & Harassment". Rob, the guy who runs it, used the fake name "Hunter" at the time because of death threats. After [[b|/b/tards]] found iReport, Rob made the profile become [[an hero|an MySpace hero]], only to [[Jesus|resurrect]] it a month later with a new (and more [[gay]]) name. Since then, Mission: MySpace has generated [[moar]] fail than all the [[emo]] [[fag]]s on the [[internets]] by constantly stopping the spread of lulz. However, it has produced many lulz as well, due to the constant [[butthurt]] caused to anyone Rob hunted.

Before the Mission, Rob recently [[troll's remorse|confessed]] to having been a [[troll]] for over a year before he started Mission: MySpace. Apparently he thought he [[old|grew out of]] trolling. However, he was never one with the [[lulz]] in the first place, having been a member of the [[n00b]]ish [[Anti-Emo Federation]].

Mission: MySpace was deleted when a bunch of [[butthurt]] [[pervert]]s reported him because he was hunting them, but the [[faggot]]ry immediately returned, as did the profile-killing. The profile, as well as Rob, then [[GTFO|disappeared forever]].

[[Last Thursday|Recently]], some [[newfag]] remade the damn thing. It's not the same [[fag]], and it [[LOL WUT|doesn't have the same damn default picture]], nor the [[crap]] the other one posted all over the place. However, the faggotry persists, and should be approached with caution as before. Never mind, it's dead now.

==The Mission==

[[Image:Selfpwn.png|thumb|Mission:MySpace minions are [[Internet Tough Guy|IRL vigilantes]]. [[Serious business]] indeed.]]

The mission is to enforce the [[tl;dr|MySpace Terms of Service]] to the point of being [[anal]], and to [[troll|aggravate every MySpace user]]. While he denies the fact that he is a [[troll]], Mission: MySpace's profile-killing sprees normally produce a lot of [[lulz]] because [[MySpace]] [[faggot]]s get [[emo]] when their profiles are [[pwn]]ed by partially-[[India|outsourced]] MySpace Customer Care. [[Pedophile]]s and [[face-painter]]s are normally [[lol-cow|milked]] for the most [[lulz]].

==Mission: MySpace's Associates==

*[[Danielspengies]], a [[fat]] [[camwhore]] who likes to show his [[cock]] to the [[internets]]. He doesn't understand he's [[fugly]] enough to make people want to become [[an hero]]es. While a [[troll]], Danielspengies helps Mission: MySpace on occasion by [[troll's remorse|ratting out his fellow trolls]] after they [[rape|raep]]ed a group. However, Rob grew [[butthurt|tired]] of Danielspengies' [[cock]], so he forced him to move to [[JewTube]] by [[baleet]]ing his MySpace profile twice a day.
*[[Jude's Army]], before she was exposed and decided to [[delete fucking everything]].
*[[User:Like omg it's stefanie|Stefanie Johnson]], a former MySpace troll who betrayed the trolls and now works with Mission: MySpace. Nobody's seen her [[n00dz]], but it is suspected her [[pussy]] is in bad shape because she has [[over 9000]] [[STD]]s. Also a [[JewTube]] whore, Stefanie has had numerous experiences with the [[lulz]], however, she prefers being [[rape]]d by them and feeling the subsequent [[butthurt]] to being [[awesome]] and spreading them.
*:Stefanie, could you cut the [[SSP]]? Thanks.
*[[Fundie]]s and [[concerned mother]]s. That's all that was on the profile's friendlist.

==Enemies of the Mission==

[[MySpace trolls]], [[face-painter]]s, [[pedophile]]s, and assorted other [[sick fuck]]s like [[you]].

Also, [[infantilism|infantilists]] hate Mission: MySpace, as do [[furries]] because Mission: MySpace is engaging in e-[[fursecution]] against them, per MySpace's request.

==The Guy'''s''' Behind It==

Rob is a [[MySpace troll]] whose real name, [[some argue]], is in fact <s>Hunter</s> Chase (though they are wrong, he is a [[Eurofag]] with a [[TL;DR]] and unpronounceable last name. He is even fluent in [[Moonspeak]]). Rob is known for being the best/worst (depending on your [[POV]]) example of [[internet humanitarianism]] evar. However, Rob is no prude, and [[camwhore|takes revealing photos]] to use for [[cyber sex|undercover operations using fake profiles disguised as himself]]. All sorts of [[jailbait]] on MySpace drool over his pics, but Rob is either completely fucking oblivious to this, or, more likely, he's [[gay]]. Also, though he claims to hunt [[troll]]s, it is quite likely that he is just a troll, one whose act has been generally unhindered for a long time.

The new M:MS profile WAS run by a [[fag]] named John, who is [[at least 100|22]] yet still [[pedophilia|has a strange obsession with cartoons and video games]]. John is likely using [[internet humanitarianism]] as an excuse to look for [[CP]] on MySpace. When he gets [[v&]], internet humanitarianism will have been further ruined from its already pathetic state.

==The End of the Internet Humanitarianism==

The Mission: MySpace venture ended when Rob/Hunter turned down a job offer from [[MySpace]], and was then [[baleet]]ed by a horde of [[babyfur]]s who mass-reported him. However, Rob did manage to get [[over 9000|over 7000]] MySpace profiles removed. Unfortunately, [[at least 100]] of those were faggot fail [[troll]]s and [[Anon]]s. Rob's final (and possibly lulziest, actually, for sure lulziest) MySpace effort was starting the most massive [[fursecution]] attack on MySpace to date, per request of MySpace, lol.

==Theories==

[[Image:Robyucko1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bullshit|Not a troll]].]]

[[Image:Chase1.png|thumb|Mission:MySpace using his alter ego Chase Colborn to threaten [[Jude's Army]] in an email.]]

[[Image:Chase2.png|thumb|Rob admitting to being Chase Colborn. [[Fail]].]]

Some argue Rob does everything [[for the lulz]], and should be treated as any other troll. Evidence for this theory:

*He knows almost every fucking [[meme]] on the [[internet]] and [[trying too hard|tries too hard]] to show off his netspeak knowledge.
*He makes fake profiles of [[16-year-old girl]]s for pedo hunting on [[MySpace]]. Before getting the pedos [[partyvan|v&]], when the pedos offer to trade nudes with his fake, Rob will reply to teh pedo n00dz with [[goatse]], [[tubgirl]], and [[2girls1cup]].

Some argue Rob is [[gay]] and [[unfunny]]. Evidence for this theory:

*He was a [[MySpace celebrity]].
*He has a [[MySpace]].
*He made a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-vQMleB2ZE video making fun of Anonymous] (DEAD), though many speculate this was done to troll.
*Popped collar.
*He's a [[Republican]].

{{quote|I'm a [[virgin]] and I've [[what|never even jacked off]], OK?!|RobDoesTheInternet - July 27, 2008}}

Now if a 19-year-old guy says that, [[some argue]] he is simply [[asexual]], but considering his burning hatred for all forms of [[secks]], it is suspected he either lacks a [[cock]] or took part in the BME Pain Olympics, <s>though his voice indicates otherwise</s>. Voice synthesizers.

==Other Ventures==

Rob made it on the news for his internet humanitarianism and even attained [[e-fame]] for a brief period. However, he's [[complete rewrite|starting from scratch]]. He's moved to [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]]. Who knows where he'll end up next. Hopefully [[GTFO|off the internets]], though likely in gay porn.

{{quote|If you want to make fun of me, please get my approval beforehand, I don't want negative stuff about me out there on the internet. I mean, I am trying to get a good career and all.|Future [[porn|Movie]] Star, Rob}}

==Mission: MySpace on Other Sites==

Rob has also started hunting profiles on [[Facebook]], and now holds the kill record there as well. It is suspected that Rob has become [[Mark Zuckerberg]]'s [[cowboy|butt buddy]], if not [[IRL]], then at least [[OL]]. [http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=6267694287 Mission: Facebook] is full of [[fail]] as well, since it seems Rob has only been going after the [[typical]] [[homosexual]]s, [[pedophile]]s, [[face-painter]]s and [[troll]]s. All the [[fanboi]]s of the page are [[fat]] to the point where [[fat girl angle shot]]s can't save them. It is still under speculation as to why they have not [[an hero|been courteous enough to remove their fat fugliness from the gene pool]].

==Mission: Pornstar==

Recently, Rob quit MySpace in a [[TL;DR]] diatribe which was <s>the long-anticipated start to his gay porn career</s>, '''it was all an effort to get around 30 very popular (read: porn) YouTube channels deleted, which he managed to by sucking [[YouTube Staff]] cock.'''

Rob has not been sighted since his departure from YouTube under the name RobDoesTheInternet. However, [[o rly|channels still keep disappearing]]. If [[you]] see him, add his link to the '''External Links''' section below.

==Update==

Rob still hunts profiles on Failbook on a weekly basis, but spends most of his interwebs time trolling fellow [[homosexual]]s on [[RealJock|RealJoke]] and slutting around on [[BigMuscle]], though he apparently [[faggot|has a boyfriend]].
