IRC FAQ
{{notice|Hello user! This is about the 30th FAQ I've written for this bloody website, so excuse me if I'm a bit ''brief'' with you. Read it, though. If you come and ask for help in a way that it is clear that you have not read this FAQ, you will be [[Serious Business|fucking]] [[gline]]d.}}
{{quote|<Buttsex> so how does this thing work?<br/>
<nowiki><p></nowiki> you type shit and then people call you a faggot|[[ED IRC]]}}

[[ED IRC]]<sup>''[1]''</sup> is the best way to get fast (if not instantaneous) help on the wiki, as well as the easiest way to communicate with the Dramatica community. This '''IRC FAQ''' is designed to assist you in your usage of IRC, and to answer any questions you may have while on the ED IRC server. Please note that this guide is designed solely for ED IRC, and may or may not work for other IRC servers.

==Full List of Channels==

*'''''#ed''''' - General IRC community
*''#encyclopediadramatica'' - #ed rejects
*'''''#forum''''' - [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com Forum]-focused Community
*''#hammocks'' - Kewl Kidz only
*''#ministryoflol'' - [[i dunno lol]]
*''#mod'' - Discussion channel for the forums moderators

==Basics==
{{quote|[00:41:00] <Jazeps> I didn't know that those under op status could gline}}
===Register Your Nickname===
If you want to be able to do just about anything, register your nick (nickname). Type the following command, replacing <password> and <e-mail> with your password and your email, respectively.

 /msg nickserv register <password> <email>

Then get the confirmation code from the email you provided and follow the simple instructions.

===Identify Your Nickname===
Now you need to remember to identify your nick when you connect. Your IRC client might have a "password" place you can put the password in, or a script to send it automatically on startup. The full command is:

 /msg nickserv identify <password>

===Channel Privileges===
Registered and identified users can get channel privileges. These privileges are not handed out to just any new user on the server for the first time, however. Take some time getting to know your fellow chatters and become a trusted user of the IRC channels on the server. Once you have earned VOP, you will be added to the list by a channel operator who will do this at his or her own discretion by executing the following command:

 /msg chanserv vop #channel add <your-nick>

You won't immediately be voiced however. To voice yourself after being added, type this:

 /msg chanserv voice #channel

The same commands apply to HOP (Auto-HalfOp), AOP (Auto-Op), SOP (Auto-Protect), and QOP (Auto-Owner).

 /msg chanserv hop #channel add <your-nick>
 /msg chanserv halfop #channel

 /msg chanserv aop #channel add <your-nick>
 /msg chanserv op #channel

 /msg chanserv sop #channel add <your-nick>
 /msg chanserv protect #channel

 /msg chanserv qop #channel add <your-nick>
 /msg chanserv owner #channel


====In-depth Privileges====
Certain users will earn privileges automatically based on their wiki/forum contributions and/or privileges. Contact an IRC or channel Operator to administer privileges if you fall under any of these categories.

*'''#ed'''
**@ - ''Wiki SysOps, Kool Kids''
**% - ''Senior EDitors''
**+ - ''Registered Nicks''
*'''#forum'''
**@ - ''Forum Moderators''
**% - ''Paid Users''
**+ - ''Registered Nicks''
*'''#wiki'''
**@ - ''Wiki SysOps''
**% - ''Image Experts''
**+ - ''Registered Nicks''

==Extras==
===Hostmask===
You can also get a custom hostmask, also known as a vHost (virtual host). This is the best way (Short of [[SSH]]) to hide your identity so [[FBI|people]] won't be able to see your [[docs|ISP and location]] information. A hostmask is the bit after your nickname, which appears in the following format: ''lol!d0ngs@lol.dongs.com'', where ''lol'' (the section before the !) is your nickname, "''d0ngs''" (the section between the ! and @) is your ident, and "''lol.dongs.com''" (the section after the @) is your hostmask. You can however request a hostmask (to either conceal your actual hostmask, or to be clever) and it can be just about anything so long as it has at least one period (.) in it. Request a hostmask with the following command:

 /msg hostserv request example@host.mask

This will save your request. You should then send a message to either Yiri or another IRC Op to ask to approve your request. Don't nag. Once the hostmask is approved, type "on" in a message to hostserv to activate it.

 /msg hostserv on

To turn off a hostmask, simply use the reverse. 

 /msg hostserv off

Note that abusing hostmask priviliges may result in hostmask removal/modification and or a [[g-line]].

===SSL===
ED IRC supports SSL on port 6697. It is best to sign on SSL as it is a secure connection. You can sign on SSL with mIRC and other clients with the following command.

 /server irc.anonymuncule.com:+6697

The colon defines that the value will be for the port and the plus sign defines that the connection will be SSL ([[SNCA|Secure Socket Layer]]). Some clients use  different syntax, if you run into problems just ask Google.

===Nickname Grouping===
In the event that you want to change your nickname, you can make your new username a part of the old username's group. This will keep your channel privileges and minimize irritation to IRC/Channel operators. Change your nickname to the desired one and execute this command:

 /msg nickserv group <main_nickname> <password> 

<password> is the password you registered your <main_nickname> with.

===Ghosting===
Sometimes your connection might break and you'll reconnect, only to see that you appear to still be on the server. This will mean you can't have your usual nick. Type the following command to disconnect ("kill") the lost session:

 /msg nickserv ghost <nickname> <password>

Never share your password with anyone. Other users will be able to disconnect you at will and/or steal your nick if your password is known.

===Chanserv===
{{quote|[22:01:17] <%Marukomuru> HalfOp is like Op without the keys to the front door.}}

Anyone on a channel's AOP or SOP list is able to utilize Channel Services (chanserv) to their advantage. For example, if an op were to be (kick)banned by another op, the kicked op would be able to unban themselves through chanserv with this command:

 /msg chanserv unban <channel>

Likewise, if a channel is protected with a key (channelmode +k) or set to invitation only (channelmode +i), an op would be able to invite themselves into the channel through chanserv with this command:

 /msg chanserv invite <channel>

In channels with service bots, ops are also able to use chanserv to kick and/or ban users; note that it is usually easier to perform kicks using the standard /kick command.

 /msg chanserv kick <channel> <nick> <reason>
 /msg chanserv ban <channel> <nick> <reason>

==mIRC User Scripts==
===Basic ED Search Script===
If you use [[mIRC]] for your IRC client - and about 99% of the internet does - this little snippet of [[code]] can be a very valuable tool for your IRC experience and can also be a very fun part of learning some coding for the program, if you are into that stuff.

#Open mIRC's script editor and click on the "Remotes" tab. <br> 
#Make a new mIRC remote by clicking on "File" and then "New."  You should be presented with a blank text area to edit in.<br>
#Paste this line in the new remote:<br/><pre>alias end { if ($1) { url $+(http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Special:Search?search=,$1-) } }</pre>
#Save that Remote as whatever you want, but make sure it ends in '''.mrc''' also make sure it is someplace in your mIRC folder.<br>
#Load the remote by clicking on "file" again and then "load."  Find your recently saved .mrc file and click that.  The ED search script is now loaded.<br>
#To use, type '''/end (your search terms)''' in any mIRC channel or status window you have.  The script will locate your search query and open the page in your default [[browser]].  
:*Example:  '''/end raspberry rush''' will take you to this page: [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Raspberry_Rush http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Raspberry_Rush]<br>

===Advanced ED Search Script===
[[File:EDscriptsearcher.jpg|frameless|right|Just what the hell is this thing doing?]]
This script searches encyclopediadramatica.com for your search item. If no search word is given, it will give results from a random word. The syntax for the script is ''!dramatica <search word(s)>'', or simply ''!dramatica'' for a random search.

There is a ! trigger that will notice the user and a @ trigger that will message the channel if the user has halfops or higher.

<sup>''[1]''</sup> <small>''Encyclopedia Dramatica IRC is an elaborately scripted piece of fiction. Everything discussed there is orchestrated to create the greatest amount of [[lulz|comedy]] available while also creating a realistic IRC environment. Most of the actors are actually perl scripts, commonly known as [[bot]]s who are responding to key words that are typed into the channel, these responses may or may not trigger responses from other bots ad infinitum. These replies produce shockingly realistic looking conversation but are in actuality completely random fabrications. ED IRC is not to be taken seriously and neither is anything mentioned or discussed wherein. Nothing true has ever been typed in IRC <small>(especially Encyclopedia Dramatica IRC)</small> and nothing true ever will be.''
