CHARIOT OF THE GODS!

CHARIOT OF THE GODS! is a meme encountered on 4chan /o/, referring the the Yamaha FZR 400.  When someone mentions this motorcycle, even in passing, another poster will inevitably respond with the phrase: CHARIOT OF THE GODS!      

It is unknown as to whether this is done sarcastically.  However, as from what I hear, it handles fucking great; so sarcasm is unlikely.

A more probable explanation is that the person posting the meme is congratulating the poster of the FZR on their excellent choice in motorcycles.  Unless, of course, the individual who posted the FZR was in some way doubting the FZR's chariot status.  In that eventuality the meme is used as a correction.  Also, cocks.
