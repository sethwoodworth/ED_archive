[[Image:Toumalpron.jpg|thumb|right|Toumal doesn't make his own art. His [[fantards]] do. Such as [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/dragoneer/ The Dragoneer] who has drawn a [[goatse|lovely]] picture of Toumal shoving a [[dildo]] up his [[asshole]] while masturbating.]]

'''Yiffstar''' is a haven for [[furries]] of all sorts, but mostly the [[crap|talented]] writers of the furry world. It is run by [http://yiffstar.com/index.yiff?action=authorsearch&uid=13 Toumal], who wishes he was an [[man the harpoons|orca]]. Yiffstar provides these [[Basement-dweller|writers]] a place where they can finally post their [[fanfiction|stories]] in which their [[writing yourself into an article|self-inserts]] have sex with every single one of their characters, and then they [[fap]] to it. If they get bored, they make [[more]] characters, have themselves have sex with them, and then fap to this.<br/>Yiffstar is essentially what you get when you combine <s>[[DeviantART]]</s> [[FurAffinity]], [[LiveJournal]], and [[FanFiction.Net]]. It is a cauldron of untapped furry [[drama]] and [[fail]]. 

== The [[slashfic|Stories]] and [[ms paint|Art]] ==
[[Image:Listofetishes.jpg|thumb|right|The fetish list.]]
85% of the stories written on Yiffstar will make your [[English]] teacher [[cry]]. The other 15% will make your English teacher [[vomit]]. There are nearly 20,000+ [[yiff]] stories on the website and 15,000+ drawings. Many of them depict [[wat|Pokemon and Digimon shitting in each other's mouths or something]], and have sex acts in them that are not only [[Pain series|unfathomably disgusting]], but also [[divide by zero|physically impossible]] which only furries are [[Sick Fuck|able to get off on]]. These are some of the many [[fetish|fetishes]] and [[secks|sexual acts]] you will find in the stories and art on Yiffstar.<br/>If reading things that would make [[My Immortal|Tara Gilesbie]] scream in terror at the poor grammar and acts depicted was not bad enough, you can also view these unspeakable things in picture form. Artists spend hours laboring over their [[Jew gold|$500]] [[Serious Business|drawing tablets]] to create [[gay|pictures of dragons in diapers taking a spunk bath]], lovingly slapping them up on the site for their rabid fans. If anyone comments on the shoddy shading, lack of light source, poor anatomy, or any of the [[at least 100]] obvious flaws that any artist worth their salt would have not done, they simply cry "[[bullshit|that's not a flaw, that's my style]]!!" and will [[BAWW]] to mods to [[ban]] you after deleting your posts, leaving in the flames their fans will invariably send your way for having said the art sucks.<br/>Those who do not have obvious flaws in their artwork are pretty much trace-artists copying off others' art. Only in furrydom is referencing a pose line for line not conisderd art theft, yet drawing a simple black wolf will cause many furfags to rage over the possibility of a stolen character.

==YiffStar Chat==
[[Image:Yschatroom.jpg|thumb|right|Log in screen for the Yiffstar chatroom.]] 
When people in the Yiffstar chat aren't yiffing or sucking Toumal's dick, they're chatting about [[shit no one cares about|the hardships of their lives and how unfair the world is to them]]. The chat rooms are usually buzzing with [[aspies]], [[emo]] [[fucktards]], and [[douche]]bags who think they're [[unwarranted self importance|smarter than you]] because they went to [[college]].<br/>However, like any [[LiveJournal|social beehive]], the chat room can be disturbed if you [[troll|carefully engineer drama]]. Accusing someone of [[homophobia]] or some other form of [[Jews did WTC|bigotry]] usually does the trick.

==YiffStar Forums==
The Yiffstar forums are a treasure trove of [[lulz]] which have sadly gone unnoticed due to [[Xenu|other forces]] on the Internet. Notorious furries such as [[Blackwingdragon]] retreat here to [[hugbox|lick their wounds]], however there's no such thing as a calm furry forum; drama always must ensue, and it does. What is sad however is that there is no one present to take advantage of the drama. There's many a [[lulzcow]] but no one to milk them.

===How to Troll===
[[Image:mapofhorror.jpg|thumb|right|Well, that explains all the dolphins and killer whales.]]
*Do not be argumentative with the [[fucktards]]; it will get you banned very quickly. 
*Do not target individuals there; the mods are [[B&|of Hasty Banhammer]]. Instead, find their contact information on other sites (most give it [[fucktard|freely and Publicly]]!) and troll them there under a different name.
*Pick a highly-debated subject (like [[Abortion]] or [[Bestiality]]), make a thread about it, and wait about 20 minutes. Instant drama!
*Greet newbies and mark down genders. Note which ones become "females" later. When they post in the "Females looking for..." forums, post that they are actually male with screenshots if possible. Use this tactic sparingly; the mods are cautious. 
*Talk about anti-furry TV/articles with links, especially while new. Act like they are facts and say "[[I did it for the lulz|you just wanted to see if it's true]]". Ensure that you play dumb, and not angry, or you'll get banned. 
*Post screenshots with personal information in it (''ex: I MONGLE DOGS! I wear Diapers and dress like a little girl when mom's not home!'') in the box below. [[Copypasta|Crosspost]] links to the uploaded screenshots in places the [[sick fuck]] tends to frequent under another name, saying you found it here.

==SoFurry==
Yiffstar has recently moved to [http://sofurry.com SoFurry]; by ridding the internet of one website, it comes back in another form. What is lulzy about this however is the fact that it is clearly a clone of FurAffinity, and it is causing massive [[butthurt]] amongst the furry writers present on both sites.
