Identity theft
{{elaw}} 
'''Identity theft''' is what happens when you are such an unbelievable [[moron]] that you let someone steal your name, credit card, and Social Security number. An identity thief can [[Identity_theft/Stem|open up new credit cards]] and buy whatever shit he wants with your [[money]], cashing out your credit rating like winning the [[Vegas]] Jackpot in the process. [[God]] gives every newborn [[retard]] free [[money]], except the banks call it "credit rating". [[Jesus]] wants you to liberate it from teh JewBank.

Naturally, [[old media]] has seized upon identity theft as the newest Danger On Teh [[Internets]], right up there with [[pedophiles]], the [[Y2K]] bug, and the [[Internet Hate Machine]]. Most police agree that identity thieves get most of their info by going through your garbage, not by hacking your [[internets]] computer, but that doesn't stop the anti-internet paranoia.

The worst thing about having your identity stolen is that the [[government]] forces all identity-theft victims to tell their story on Dateline, 60 Minutes, or Nightline.

Another form of identity theft involves [[Chris-chan|stealing someone's passwords]] and gaining access to his/her various [[internet]] accounts. Though it receives less publicity, this insidious crime is actually far more damaging -- after all, you can close out your credit cards and petition the government for a new SSN, but there is absolutely nothing you can do once somebody starts leaving nasty comments with your [[LiveJournal]] account, except maybe [[buy a dog]].
