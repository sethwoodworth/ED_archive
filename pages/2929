'''''Fight Club''''' is a crappy movie from 1999 about a [[You| weedy, friendless, lisping yuppie]] who loses his mind and makes up an [[insane|imaginary friend]] to be his [[top|butch buddy]]. Instead of becoming [[an hero]] like you wish he would, he becomes the world's greatest [[Street Fighter|street fighter]] by fighting the imaginary friend. With a [[lie|believable]] plot like that, [[Anonymous]] was destined to be drawn to it very early on, even designing the [[rules of the internet]] after the rules of Fight Club. Tyler Durden is worshiped as a [[13 year old boy]]'s [[Nietzsche|ubermensch]] and strides to be a handsome anti-christ just like him despite the fact Durden is most likely [[doing it for the lulz]]. Said fanboys also listen to poser-[[punk]] rock and has never picked up a book despite worshiping Fight Club like their [[bible]]. Also expect said fanboys to spurt Fight Club quotes when their parents tells them to stop being ungrateful and do the laundry or when a teacher gives them detention for talking back.

In fact, some confused anonymous seem to think /b/ ''is'' Fight Club and never stop posting screen shots and quotes from the movie. [[fgt|These people]] were the original, undetected melanomas who grew into [[the cancer that is killing /b/]].  Memes from the movie that have been adopted by /b/'s fanbois as their own include [[Rules 1 and 2]], the names [[Project Chanology|"project"]] and [[Operation Lioncash|"operation"]] for raids, and spam threads with newfags reposting "His name is Robert Paulson" in between sagebombs and challenges to the power five.

It's a [[lie|good movie]], and you learn valuable lessons on how to [[Shock image|terrorize movie goers]] and make your own [[Jews|soap]].  The ending makes [[New York]]ers especially feel like they've been [[rape]]d because it is vaguely reminiscent of [[Jews did 911|9/11]], except for the motives: in the movie they make the buildings collapse to free people from credit-card debt but on 9/11 [[Jews|they]] did it for the insurance.

==Rules of <s>the internet</s> Fight Club==

#You do not talk about FIGHT CLUB.
#You DO NOT talk about FIGHT CLUB.
#If someone [[Rape|says stop]], [[I CAME|goes limp]], or taps out, the fight is over.
#Only two guys to a fight.
#One fight at a time.
#No shirts, no shoes.
#Fights will go on as long as they have to.
#If this is your first night at FIGHT CLUB, you HAVE to fight.
#????
#PROFIT

Note: because the first two rules of Fight Club are that [[Rules of the internet|you cannot talk about Fight Club]], it instead must be referred to as Fite [[♣]] if it must be talked about in public.

==Chuck Palahniuk==
''Fight Club'' the book was written by Chuck Palahniuk while he was recovering from a severed testicle he received while fucking his [[ass]] with a vacuum-cleaner hose with the cleaner switched on. As Palahniuk was living in Oregon at the time, and masturbation and/or working on trucks was out of the question due to his injury, he wrote ''Fight Club'' as a way to [[emo|deal with his feelings]]. [[I did it for the lulz|For teh lulz]] he submitted the book for publication and it was promptly rejected by every publisher who laid eyes on it. Fortunately for him, [[Fox]] somehow got their hands on a copy of it and [[lie|being the great arbiters of taste they are]] decided to make it into a movie.

==Faggotry==

Chuck Palahniuk is a well known flaming homofag and he brings his [[faggotry]] throughout this movie. In the very first scene we see the main character resting his weary head between the [[moobs|bitch tits]] of his fat butt buddy. In later scenes we see him taking baths together with his naked imaginary twink friend where they discuss how [[women]] are completely unnecessary. This is incorrect because women fill an important role in being [[cumdumpsters]] and in preparing food, unless of course you are a [[faggot]] like Palahniuk.
