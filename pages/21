/jp/
'''/jp/''', or the 4chan State of /jp/& was an abortive board made [[last Thursday]] by [[moot]] during his [[woman|period]]. Unhappy with all the [[Touhou|Touhoues]], [[so ronery|Visual Novels]], [[virgins|figs]], and general fun times to be had on /a/, moot reached his limit during that time of the month. In an abrasive show of his own [[emo|power]] and [[moron|smartness]], he decided to split /a/ into two slow and boring boards; /a/ and /jp/. He also instituted more [[Nazis|janitors]].

Unhappy with the the Gai/a/, several shitty drawfags MS Painted their objections, which were unbanned for a matter of seven hours. As it stands now, /a/ is nothing but people talking about ''[[bullshit|Naruto]]'', ''[[crap|Bleach]]'' and and how [[goatse|"deep"]] is ''[[shit|Gurren-Lagann]]'', as well as image dumps; it's basically become /cm/. /jp/ is filled with elitist morons talking about 3D Women, Type-Moon powerlevels, "I fuck [[you're]] touhou" jokes and exuding their weeaboo power levels over each other. However, the truth is that most /jp/ has low powerlevels since they don't know [[Japanese]] and the only eroge they played is [[Fate/stay night]]. Trolling is not allowed, because moot doesn't allow any difference in opinion. The only supporter of the split is Waruteru-chan, who even  complains of how /jp/ looks eerily similar to /a/. He often trolls between 9:00 and 1:00 EST as a cause of this.

==The comic version==
In a desperate attempt to make moot give a damn, several very, very bad drawfags offered their services and made every third thread a bitching thread. It resulted in nothing happening, just as it was thought. It did, however, give raise to a good ban.

==Modern /jp/==

/jp/ has no real Japan-related content. This enrages [[Japanophile]]s who, after looking at the board's name and its rules, believe /jp/ should be about pinku bento boxes. When they realize it's filled with [[animu]], ronery, Visual Novels, [[Touhou]] and TYPE-MOON, they proceed to collectively whine about how much the board sucks because no one wants to talk about the glorious country of Nippon. Ironically, anyone who makes a thread about Japan-related content will be flamed and directed to /trv/.

One of the reasons for it being so popular is because it's relatively safe to post CP on /jp/ because of a prototype software implemented on the board that checks every image uploaded and recognizes whether to put a spoiler image over it or leave it as is. If you've gone to /jp/ you'd have noticed that there seem to be a lot of Japanese bird cooking spaghetti threads. The reason is that software that upon realizing that CP is being uploaded, changes the content of the post and puts the spoiler image of a Japanese bird cooking spaghetti.
