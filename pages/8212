The Great Egyptian Riot of 2011
{{crap}}

Perhaps the most lulzy event in [[Egypt]] since the enslavement of the [[Jews]], the '''Egyptian 2011 Riots''' all started when after years of being [[raped|suppressed]] by the Egyptian president for the past 2900 years, the citizens of Egypt decided to start a riot and a protest against [[Hosni Mubarak]], aka the [[Kim Jong Il]] of Africa, [[IRL Troll|all-powerful dictator]] of Egypt. He is the second most hated sand-nigger on the planet besides [[Osama bin Laden]] because he enjoys IRL trolling his Egyptian citizens and barring them from [[Free Speech|saying whatever they want]]. As a last result to suppress the riots, Hosni attempted to [[Delete fucking everything|take drastic measures]] to remain in power and to stop the riots. However, [[I accidentally|his stupidity just made the riot worse and moar lethal]].

==How it all started==
Since Egypt is full of copycat Arabs, once they saw the [[Tunisian]] government collapse after 23 years of hellish autocracy, the Egyptians decided that they'd like that as well, as 30 years with the same idiot [[school|ruler]] does tend to grate on the nerves. There are other reasons as well: [[Bailout Plan|economic crisis]], [[America|lack of any type of freedom]], corruption, [[police]]men abusing their power, [[Poor|people only living on $2 a day]], [[Terrorist|church bombing]], and the fact that Mubarak has been [[Blowjob|gagging]] on [[Israeli]] [[Cock|balls]] for the past 30 years (which he truly enjoys).

==[[Anarchy|Riot breaks out]]==
[[File:This is an outrage!.jpg|thumb]]
On January 25, or "[[Rage|the Day of Anger]]," [[over 9000|thousands]] of protests occurred in many of the major cities in Egypt, and eventually [[Pool's Closed|the High Court in Cairo was closed]]. As a result, the government and the police force ended up [[Shit bricks|shitting their pants]] and tried to suppress the rioters. The police, although they had [[Guns|arms]] and shields, ended up getting [[Zerg Rush|pwnt by the protesters]]. However, the police struck back and came back with [[moar]] reinforcements on January 26. Many protesters and policemen literally killed each other and [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|many police stations and government buildings were burned to the ground]].

==The Last Straw==
[[File:EGYPTINTERNETZ.png|thumb|right]]
As a last resort and in an effort to stop the riots, Hosni [[Internet Kill Switch|killed all internetz connections in Egypt]] and [[Delete fucking everything|took down all cellphone signals]] thinking that [[No|doing so would solve the crisis]]. Making matters worse, the entire Egyptian population went completely [[batshit insane]] over not being able to download porn, and the number of protesters increased from [[over 9000|10,000 to 100,000]] in just a few hours. After realizing his extreme stupidity, Hosni ordered the police to [[Ban fucking everyone|kill fucking everyone]] that they see on sight. Many protesters were shot to death and they stopped killing random people due to [[moralfag]]gotry.

==Not Quite the Last Straw==
Mubarak, pissing himself, orders the army to take the streets and control the crowds.  The army that he has neglected and given no political powers for [[at_least_100_years|at least 30 years]], making them say "[[wut]]" or shout to Mubarak "[[NO U]]" now have control of the streets. <s>Now the army is busy shooting rampant looters and criminals.</s> LOL! In Egypt military service is compulsory so they joined the protesters. [[Cameltoe|Lucky]] for Egypt, they [[Bitches don't know|don't know]] that [[Anonymous]] is responsible for the damage. Making a [[Facebook]] page by the name of [[El Shaheed]], he just wanted to do it for the [[lulz]].

==Government Response==
When it became clear that Mubarak couldn't use the army to [[China|Tienanmen]] his restive subjects, he first tried offering a passel of [[bullshit]] concessions, like refusing to run himself or his son for office in the future, appointing the Egyptian intelligence chief/[[CIA]] [[Pulling a Lynndie|torture liaison]] Omar Suleiman[http://www.counterpunch.org/soldz01312011.html] as his first vice-president in 30 years, and offering to hold talks with [[UN]] shill Muhammad elBaradei and the [[Muslim]] Brotherhood. The protesters, though, knowing that the police already had their photos and [[Rape|what they could expect]] should Mubarak remain in power when the Day of Rage was over, rejected these half-measures and have continued balls-out to resist government suppression.

So Mubarak employed a different tactic: withdraw the police and let the ingrates taste [[Libertarianism|true anarchy]], then open the prisons, flooding the streets with criminals. These same criminals were then armed and offered commutation if they'd hop on the nearest camel and charge protesters with rocks, bricks, firebombs, and clubs as "pro-Mubarak" elements.[http://www.counterpunch.org/amin02042011.html] Thus far this has also failed to work. So Hosni resorts to whining:

<center>{{morphquote|mqtest|background-color: transparent;|font-weight: normal;|I am fed up. After 62 years in public service, I have had enough. [[Incontinence|I want to go.]]|THEN GO ALREADY YOU ASSHOLE|I don't care what people say about me.|That's why I turned off the internet, hurr derp}}</center>

==Possible Outcomes==

[[Image:Egyptteargacanister.png|thumb|right|"We are on [the Egyptian people's] side as we have been for more than 30 years." ([[Hillary Clinton]])]]
* [[Samefag|Mubarak]]'s goons sodomize democrats with American-made helicopter gunships; no change
* Transitional government headed by elBaradei and Suleiman placates the people, probably [[Lebanon|collapses]]
* [[Saudi Arabia|Islamic theocracy]]
* [[Civil war]]
* [[Somalia|Anarchy]]
* [[Old meme|Pan-Arab nationalism]]
* [[Iran|A regime just as bad as they had before]]
* [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|Pluralistic, secular democracy]]

Whichever of these it is besides the first, it will certainly fuck up Israel's ongoing [[Freedom Flotilla|siege of Gaza]] and their greater designs on the Middle East. Also, if the new government decides to restrict the Suez Canal, enjoy your new gas prices; in fact, [[you]] [[Self-entitled|better fucking hope]] Mubarak wins this shit.

==What Are They Rioting For?==
Despite supporting the riots (OMG REVOLUTION SO EXITING!!!11) no one in the western world seems to know why the Egyptians are rioting. That's because there is no reason whatsoever - Muslims just love to riot, rage, and burn stuff. For further understanding of the Muslim rioting culture, here is an educational video from Mr. Garrison. (starts at 0:49)
