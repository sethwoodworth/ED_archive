{{quote|Isn't that an oxymoron?|Anon}}

'''Manly Tears''' is a disease common in, but by no means limited to, [[anime]] and kung-fu movies. [[Some argue]] that it has recently made its way to the west and started to affect [[b|/b/tards]], while others simply view it as a handy excuse which allows the [[Anon]] in question to well up inside without being accused of [[faggotry]] or starting a [[BAWWW]] thread.
