'''I Dunno LOL''' is [[your]] response to every question. It originally started as a joke on the faggoty forum Scorehero, then became a response to the meme [[How do I shot web?]] but is now used by every faggot and his gay dog to express how utterly pointless and devoid of value their opinion truly is.
