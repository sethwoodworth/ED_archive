The creator of [[MySpace]]. [[MySpace]] is Tom's pathetic ploy to gain [[e-celebrity]] status and the accompanying [[azn]] [[pu55y]] - Tom is the biggest friend [[slut|whore]] on MySpace - all new [[MySpace]] users are added to Tom's [[friends]] list by default, making him appear [[uber]]-[[e-popular|popular]].  Tom admitted in private conversation that this was to make it appear that [[MySpace]] has a networking system similar to Friendster's.  Obviously MySpace users are too stupid to notice that every single profile they've seen ''"is in your extended network"''. 

Tom has a [http://www.valleywag.com/tech/tom-anderson/myspace-toms-real-friends-secret-comments-list-leaked-179346.php sekrit profile] dedicated to friending 4'10" [[oriental]] camwhores, his fetish. His profile pics are of him hanging out with [[azn]] models, [[Prostitute|porn stars]] and drag queens from the [[Los Angeles]] area. Unsurprisingly, they all seem to be shot in dark parking lots.

Tom got 580 million bucks for selling MySpace to [[Rupert Murdoch]], but he's still the saddest dot commer ever.  Not only does he have to fly in unsuspecting ass to get laid, but [http://www.valleywag.com/tech/tom-anderson/myspace-tom-orders-halfprice-assbyair-said-random-asian-girl-172330.php he'll only pay half the airfare.]

==The early years==
[[Image:tom-leer.jpg|thumb|All your [[16 year old girl|daughters]] are belong to [[cockmongler|Tom]] ]]
Tom went to Havatampon High School and excelled in [[faggotry]], well taught by Prof. Dave Adams (p.grayburn@gmail.com). The highlight of Tom's high school years was the proud day he was voted prom [[queen]]. Tom went batshit insane and began writing children novels about gay sex and public fapping. He wrote a book about how to rape children with over 9000 penises. But what Tom was mostly known for was his love for feces. He would spend hours eating feces, smelling feces, and the most horrible of all public fapping while holding a picture of Rosie O'Donnell. Tom would also tell his parents one day he would make a great website for people with no life, unfortunately he failed. Tom moved out and took on female stripping as his job making under minimum wage because the owner believed he was a 9 year old asian girl.

==Follow the camwhore pic road==
[[Image:Aznfag.jpg|thumb|right|Tom says: "I would do her"]]
After being voted prom queen, Tom experienced brief notoriety amongst the [[fag hag]] population of his largely [[azn]] high school. This nourished Tom's stunted and bruised ego and set the stage for the dark psychology which spawned a handful of [[porn]] sites and, worse yet, [[MySpace]] itself.

Quickly abandoned by his cadre of fag hags, Tom felt betrayed and craved attention, preferably in the form of [[chihuahuas|teacup]] [[azn]] [[16 year old girl|girls]] which even he could stand a chance at intimidating.  Chasing his dream, Tom joined a dot com company and [http://valleywag.com/tech/myspace/myspace-toms-porno-past-188544.php used their equipment] to develop TeamAsian.com while on the clock. After he was fired, he devoted himself full time to producing skeezy azn pr0n.

Tom soon found that Chinese [[hooker]]s were wise to his tricks and could not be controlled.  Also, they were old and worldly.  Not fresh.  Not clean.  Not unspoiled save for the playful cynicism of a young teen.  Tom needed younger, unsuspecting [[pussy]] without track marks.  He put TeamAsian.com up for sale for $360,000 and developed [[MySpace]].

==[[Jakejekyll|Shangri-la]]==
[[Image:Myspacetomrofl.GIF|thumb|Thanks to [[Rupert Murdoch]] Tom truly does have an [[unlimited disposable income]]]]
MySpace succeeded beyond Tom's wildest dreams.  Assured a thousand lifetimes of self-indulgent [[camwhore]] pics, an unending flood of [[16 year old girl|underage]] [[cunt|vaginae]] and eternal [[Internet celebrity|e-popularity]] by his cunning "ALL users are friends of Tom" scheme, Tom embarked upon a rampage of yellow cherry plundering, stopping only to [http://valleywag.com/tech/myspace/dont-fuck-with-myspace-tom--literally-181105.php delete the profiles] of unsatisfied victims who complained publicly about his small [[cock]].

Then [[Rupert Murdoch]] bought MySpace for $580 million.

This alone proves there is no justice in the universe.  If we examine Tom's story critically, we ''must'' come to the conclusion that suicide is the only option for one and all.

==The anti-Tom movement==
[[Image:Fuckyoutom.jpg|thumb|Watch dashboard confessional videos, that'll keep your [[MySpace]] safe.â€Ž]]
Tom's [[faggotry]] and excessive censorship on [[MySpace]] has led to a whole genre of anti-MySpace sites where members of this emerging subculture meet to share [[furry art|artwork]], [[shit bands|music]] and [[hate|sentiments]] about how gay Tom is.
