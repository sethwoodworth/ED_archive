Completely irrelevant history

Without [[completely irrelevant history]], the [[Internets]] would die. It is the ''[[LOL WUT|gens et fons]]'' of the world wide web.

==Here's How It Works==

# Prima gets an internet connection. She's so happy! Look at happy Prima. She has access to music, [[E (prefix)|e]]-commerce and, [[THE BEST|best]] of all, [[porn]].
# Prima decides to talk to other people with internet connections and get a better sense of the world in which she lives. This will also give her a chance to speak to other [[16 year old girl|like-minded individuals]] on a [[crap|common passion]]. Perhaps she likes potpourri or stamp collecting?
# Prima goes to a forum regarding her [[fandom|hobby]] and begins to [[chat]] with other people.
# One day, another person with an internet connection, Secunda, poses an opinion different to Prima's!!! [[oh noes|OH NOEZ]]!!!
# Prima, rationally and without malice, tries to show why Secunda is wrong.
# Secunda declares Prima to be [[insane]].
# Secunda has [[e-pal|e-friends]] â€” one of whom might be a [[dwarf]]. They all come to Secunda's aid and suddenly there is an argument on the internets!
# From now on, Prima and Secunda will always be adversaries. If Prima ever writes anything, Secunda will take the contrary position. Verily, this completely irrelevant history has become the sole motivation behind all of their [[flame wars|interactions]].
# ????
# PROFIT!

==When to Use Completely Irrelevant History==
Completely irrelevant history should be used in all of the following situations:

*Talking about [[religion]]
*[[flame wars|Attacking]] with [[ad hominem]]
*Discussions on [[ship]]ping, especially if you're in the ''Harry Potter'' fandom
