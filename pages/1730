'''Conficker,''' also known as the venjix virus, is a hugely successful computer virus that will fuck up your computer the instant you let it in. Due to the failure of [[Microsoft]], it is infecting computers at a rapid rate and their shitty patches and antivirus programs cannot compete. Conficker is truly the [[AIDS]] of computer viruses, given its brutality - king of the computer worms just as AIDS is king of the STDs. There are many ways you can get Conficker, including [[oral sex|through internet downloads]] and by [[anal sex|sticking an infected USB into your computer's tight hole]].

The name comes from the word 'configure' and the [[German]] word 'ficker', meaning '[[fuck]]er', as to fuck with your computer's configuration settings. The [[FBI]] have put out a $250K reward for information leading to the arrest of [[Mike Sandy|its creators]].

The only way to fully safeguard against Conficker is [[I GOT NORTON!|getting Norton]], which will [[pwn]] this shitty worm into oblivion, to be forgotten like the [[Y2K bug]].
