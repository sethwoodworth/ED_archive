Important people

Dominant people have long been important in society. Ranging from celebrities to slightly less popular celebrities, these important people make life worth living. They are constant sources of [[drama]] and [[lulz]], especially at the expense of their many [[fanboys]].

Important people on the [[internets]] are different to important people [[IRL]]. Important people on the [[internets]] are often ignored by the world at large, with the exception of [[fat]] kids reenacting [[Star Wars]]. The aforementioned are often the subject of [[internet lawsuit]]s and massive exchanges of [[internet money]].

== A Partial List of Important People: ==
*Johnny Cash
*The President of Paraguay
*[[Jesus]]
*Sir Walter Raleigh
*[[Mary-Kate]] and [[Ashley Olsen]]
*[[Dave Eggers]]

== Important People on the [[Internets]]: ==
*[[Ripper]]

Important people are not to be confused with [[internet celebrities]], who are often touchstones of moral and social [[enlightenment]].
