You are now listening to something your grandparents had sex to.  This means little in the grand scheme of things, as the song is timeless and you have never had sex.  In fact, if you are a youngster right now, attempt the feat of having sex with your lover to the time of this song, but only if it is another human being and not your hand.  

When the guitarist starts soloing, you must stick your finger in the butthole of your lover.  When this occurs, it is affectionately called a '''''crescendo,''''' as it is a climax of sorts on both a musical and physical level.
