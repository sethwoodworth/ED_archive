I'll just leave this here
'''I'll just leave this here''' is chanspeak which enjoyed a [[surprise sex|random surge]] of popularity around September 2008. It is used to attach an inappropriate level of nonchalance to an act such as showing tits, dropping someone's [[dox|IRL details]] or posting the most horrifying piece of pornography one could imagine. It can also be used as an accelerant to turn some [[hack|kindling]] into a [[gov.palin@yahoo.com|forest fire.]]

The "I'll just leave this here" card is best played as an [[OP|original post]] from out of nowhere, and contain material that will make the average /[[b]]/tard drop [[loli|everything]] and either [[rAIDS|get busy]] with the info, or [[frustration|rage]] [[anarchy|uncontrollably]].
