At first glance, '''deviantART''' appears to be an inspiring treasure-trove of [[Unrealistic expectations|wishful-thinking]] [[fanart]] and pseudo-professional "[[Shitty art|artwork]]." 
In reality, [[Truth|it is one of many gigantic culture-fucks of societal degeneration]].

Deviantart, who's kingdom to all [[WWOEC|childhood memories raped]] is filled with [[Furfags|Furries]], [[Teruchan|Pedophiles]], [[Bleedman|Perverts]], [[Azns|Azns]], [[Weeaboos|Wapanese]] and of everything worse imaginable. It is expected to find [[Rule34|Rule34]], [[WWOEC|WWOEC]], [[Furaffinity|Furaffinity]] users constantly checking and updating their user page [[E-penis|E-penis]] and [[Moar|Steroidatizing]] it to grow larger from with all the other sick fucks in the world who share the common love of buttsex, [[Fag|faggotry]] and [[Anime|Anime]]. Constant exposure to this site is likely to have [[you|you]] become one.

While similar establishments like [[MTV]] destroy good music by motivating [[You|the public]] to become [[wiggers]] and [[prostatot]]s, deviantART destroys the good art world by fulfilling its function of turning out furry [[drama whore]]s and [[emo]] [[attention whore]]s. If the art community as a whole had cancer, then deviantART would be the biggest malignant tumor of them all.

DeviantART's population consists mainly of emotionally-unstable [[16 year old girls|artists]] who aspire to [[wapanese|move to Japan]] and become famous manga artists but instead they end up as [[Cosplay]] [[attention whore|enthusiasts]] that earn a living off the [[shit|Harajuku]] by exchanging [[Prostitute|odd jobs]] for food in the back alleys behind the clothing stores.

Worst thing about DeviantART is that the forums are full of whiny and/or butthurt retards who think they are cool for knowing so many /b/ memes.

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Adding [[Lens flare]]s to your art will give you [[A+]] results.

==Submission Categories==
[[Image:HowDAworks.jpg|thumb|Is this your [[popular]]ity guide?]]
[[Image:I hate ED!!!!!!.jpg|thumb|An average journal. [[irony|"I hate racism and jews"]]]]

===Artisan Crafts===
Before the invention of the [[Internets]], people were rumored to make art such as [[Unicorn Orgy]], [[IRL]]. They used boulders, ripped-up [[fursuit]]s, and [[semen]]. At present, all the craftsmen who aren't dead are pot-smoking [[hippies]] who can't use [[computers]], rendering this section totally fucking useless.

===Traditional Art===
By far the largest section of DA, this is where users place their painstakingly-rendered [[anime]]/[[furry]]/[[inflation art]] <strike>drawings</strike> [[tracing]]s with blotchy graphite shading. Others attempt to exploit the versatility of [[MS Paint]] to project a [http://jerryvaradian.deviantart.com/art/Peace-in-Lebanon-38050156 political message] of some sort. (If you click on the link, try not to shit yourself laughing. That would be rude.) It's also the category for drawings made by people who are too noob to use computers and art programs.

===Digital Art===
If you are unable to operate a pencil for any reason, this section is for you! Just fire up [[Photoshop]], collage some random shit you found on [[Google]] Images and voil√†! You're only HALF as lame as the [[Church of the Subgenius]]!
http://irawalrus.deviantart.com/art/Brother-guess-what-you-get-182793134?q=&qo=

Remember, catering to fetishists insures a steady stream of pageviews, and the [[popular|big kids]] favor quantity over quality. Playboy models need not be college or even college junior graduates, hence why waste pearls on [[furry|anthromorphic]], [[tiny dick|shrinking]], [[inflation|inflating]] swine?

[[Image:Deviantss.jpg|thumb|right|A screenshot of a screenshot of a screenshot. [[You|Who'da thunk it?]] ]]

===Photography===
[[Image:DevianTARD-DoinItWrong.jpg|thumb|The skill of an average deviantART photographer...]]
[[Image:Fuglyemo.jpg|thumb|90% of deviantART camwhores.]]Thanks to the advent of ubiquitous digital image capturing, every [[16 year old girl]] and their little brother thinks they're Ansel-Fucking-Adams. These people usually can't draw. To facilitate this movement, DA created the photography section. It was promptly populated by [[camwhore]]s afflicted by [[Internet disease]]s. Remember, [[Lens flare]] gives you 10 times more popularity! Any and all other photographs are of uninspired things (try photographing a tree, it's sooooo deep, man) and naturally receive [[about 100]] favorites within a few seconds of their posting. HDR photos are automatically awarded a daily deviation a think and receive [[over 9000]] faves no matter how shitty they are (BECAUSE IT IS SO SURREAL LOL). Then there are camwhores who think they're SUPER DUPER SPECIAL because they take pictures of their horsies and think people are jealous of their awesome pets when they can be doing things more productive with their boring lives.

===Poetry===
Writings featured on DA are usually [[emo]] rants about blood, razorblades, and the relationship between the two. Written largely by [[16 year old girls]], they are often rendered [http://emo-tears-falling.deviantart.com/ phonetically impossible] by assloads of spelling errors. Once a user submits something, it automatically turns into an [[Crap|"artistic expression."]]  As a result, many deviantART poets just submit their [[LJ]] entries, which additionally guards themselves against being branded as [[drama whore]]s because, you know, "[[Waaaambulance|I'M JUST EXPRESSING MYSELF]], MAN.  WHAT, DID YOU THINK [[hippie|JIM MORRISON]] WAS A DRAMA WHORE, TOO, YOU CALLOUS CRETIN?"

===Prose===
<del>Prose is like poetry, only you're supposed to have spent more time on it</del> NOBODY on deviantART knows what prose means. While '''poetry''' focuses on the surrealist interpretations of [[cutting]], '''prose''' mentions every detail of your 30 minute cut-a-thon, and later goes into how nobody from school understands your scars, and how your gf/bf/ff left you because you're a pathetic, whiny [[attention whore]]. Any and all good criticism given of prose on deviantART ''will''(without exception) be written off by the whiny TARD as you being abusive, since 99% of all prose on DA is apparently written by the same syphilitic leper. The truly great prose of deviantART art is overlooked because it is too long and/or too complex for the average 16-year-old.

===Desktop Capture===
[[Image:Printscreenequalstalent.jpg|thumb|right|Need to imitate talent? Just hit printscreen.]]
Most DA users are just not up to speed. Unable to produce even the most crude stick-figure depictions of "tasteful" [[furry]] or ''Invader Zim'' [[fanart]]? No need not feel left out! Simply mash your overly large, greasy thumb onto the [[Screencap|printscreen]] key will capture your amazing desktop! Now you can receive praise and glory based on your interesting desktop background and [[360 kid|show everyone online]] that you are a cool cat with all the latest icons. [[Firefox]] is mandatory; don't even bother otherwise. Also, lacking a ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' icon loses you serious points.

In order to boost your [[hxc]] points, having your icons in no particular order helps you score, too. Remember, organization is for [[n00bs]]!

===Flash===
Why DA decided to host [[Flash]]-based animations is anyone's guess. The only users who submit Flash works on DA are failures (and [[diva]]s) who couldn't get on [http://albinoblacksheep.com AlbinoBlackSheep] or even [http://newgrounds.com Newgrounds]. The majority of these creations usually involve [[ninja]]s or absolute [[shit]] such as [[cosplay|dress up games]].

===Three Dimensional Art===
At the mention of the words "3D art", you're probably thinking "u meen liek XBAWKS graffiks" or Toy Story quality work. You will not find any of that on deviantart. Instead you will find Poser-generated bullshit and [[Second Life]] screenshots, which equates to playing with Barbie dolls except with less facial expressions.

===Fractal Art===
To put it simply: Push button, receive blobs of colors. Although the actual concept of fractal geometry far is too complex for most people to understand.

==Journal Culture==
[http://kit-prower.deviantart.com/journal/25419449/ Okay, i got scarlet fever, as the journal entry suggests. It's a lovely little disease that causes a rash that itches to hell and back, causes evil evil fever, causes enflamed throat, skull cleaving headaches, and god do i ever have to scratch my balls... i mean seriously, of all the places the rash could have gone, it went to my back, which i can't scratch, and to my god damn nuts.]

==Types of Tartlets (Deviants)==
[[Image:A scary photo of myself.jpg|thumb|[[Snapesnogger|The most well known of all Tartlets, Snapesnogger.]]]]

''Tartlets'' (also known as ''Deviants'') can choose what kind of Deviant they want to pretend to be by choosing from a drop-down menu. They are listed here in order of increasing offensiveness.

Regardless of type, however, all tartlet usernames must have [[wolfaboo|references to wolves]], the moon, [[Sonic the Hedgehog]], be a character from any video game, or end with -chan.

===The Artist (''Artifex Faber'')===
Constantly [[banhammer|banhammered]] for displaying none of the above characteristics and wanting a place to share their art, the ''Artifex Faber'' population has experienced a sharp decline, becoming an endangered species relegated to a life of struggling to feed and clothe themselves and their [[Bristol Palin|17 year-old, 8-month-pregnant girlfriend]]. Many have fled deviantART to more quality-oriented art sites like [http://www.storm-artists.net/ Storm Artists]. However, it is still believed this form of [[Internet]] artist will become extinct by next year. Van Gogh, Da Vinci, and Michaelangelo are spinning in their graves because of this.

===The Addict (''Sucis Chumpicus'')===
Tartlets who spend all day on deviantART in the [[complaints forum]] or the [[Emo|help with life forum]] complaining about how much everything on deviantART sucks.

===The Attention [[Troll]] (''Gobblus Atticus'')===
Those who make dA slightly more interesting, providing comments of both controversial and plain annoying natures to provoke responses from those who are willing to post multitudes of journals (i.e [[furries]] and any other member of the 'whores' family, such as Favewhores, [[Chat|dAmnwhores]], etc.). This specific type of troll originates in the forums, sometimes from other sites, and they most commonly evolve out of sheer boredom. A common characteristic is to stalk admins who then reject them; leaving the troll in a state of site-hatred, often fleeing to [[ED]] and making pages concerning the [[admins]].

===The Favewhore (''Amorae Ubiquitus'')===
[http://alaniagryphon.deviantart.com/ A Deviant who goes around adding every single submission of another's gallery into their favorites gallery, and everything that goes into their message inboxes.]  ''Amorae Ubiquitus'' usually has little or no deviations, or fucking huge galleries full of crap made in [[MSPaint]], or stolen art.

Typical comment by these douchebags: [[Wapanese|"OMG LIEK KAWAIII NEKO DESUDESUDUES!!111"]]

===The Wallpaperist (''Muro Faber'') ===
Deviants who believe that running a random script through a 3D-gen program and adding text makes them "interesting". The most common specimens of ''Muro Faber'' are [[13 year old boys|13-year-old boys]], who just don't know what the fuck "interesting" is, or [[Retard|20-year-old boys]] who still think it makes them "interesting".

===The Litigious Crumpet (''Imma Gonna Sue-a Ya Assa Offa'')===
Artist whom will go batshit insane if any of her ''pwecious images'' have been severely altered (i.e. turned into an icon for a forums board or even passed around period, because whats even worse than having your images cut-up by MSPaint?) and threatens to sue people utilizing the oft-abused weapon (and often yiffed by Furries) called the ''Digital Millennium Copyright Act" (DMCA).

===The 20+ Retard (''Sophmorus Obsoletus'')===
[[Image:Syringe2_by_bohemi_stock.jpg|thumb|right|[[boh3m3]] deviantART.]]
A Deviant who claims to be [[pedobear|over 20 years old]] but draws and types like a 3-year-old. If you give the least bit of criticism, they will [[RAEG|block you]], [[spam|flag the comment as spam]], [[bawww|or hide the comment]]. The only people that like these types of artists are other such crappy artists or ones that have no art in their gallery and have no idea what art is. 

[http://massivedestroyier.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d337u3a Critique? You die]

[[Image:fuckyouDevTART.jpg|thumb|Let the van hit you on the way out]]

===The Flash Maker (''Fulgore Faber'')===
[[13-year-old boys]] who make boring looped Flash Animations of [[unfunny|random]] subjects that consist of five frames and run for ten seconds. Otherwise, they make countless dating game simulations featuring stick figures or tracings from ''[[Dragonball Z]]'' so that they can fap to them. These tartlets usually belong on [[YTMND]] or [[Newgrounds]] but some migrate to deviantART for additional attention-whoring.

===The "Draw Something Else Already" Fetishist ''(Copaepastus Unoriginus)''===
People who make and submit absolutely nothing but pictures that portray their main fetish(es). They're much worse than your typical tartlet, especially if they consistently rub said fetish(es) into other people's faces.

===dAmnwhores (''Audarae Filia'')===
13-to-16-year-old girls who frequent deviantART's chatrooms. Unlike the forums, the CHAT is teh most denjerus place in deviantART. dAmn (deviantART [[Masturbation|Messaging]] Network) is inhabited by camwhores, pedophiles, azns, white men, crackwhores, stoners, filipinos, and George W. Bush.

===The Camwhore (''Vidarae Filia'')===
[[16 year old girls]] who've evacuated from MySpace shutdowns and timeouts in favor of the deviantART shutdowns and timeouts. They herald their existence by flooding the front pages with crappy webcam shots of their ass and graduate to posting thinly-veiled shots of their [[penis|vagina]] under the pretense of '[[Bullshit|Artistic Nudity]]'. Naturally, they get almost as many Daily Deviations as ''The Pornographer''.

===The Hybrid (''Portmanteau'')===
A fairly common but equally pretentious breed of Tartlet who is an incestuous inbred combination of significant traits deriving from all, or a select few of the other deranged types of 'Deviant'. They herald delusions that only their twisted ideals hold value, and if said view is confronted, they attempt to suck the fan/fapping sympathy of DeviantART's community teet through worthless Journal venting whenever an emotional surge occurs in their otherwise pathetic lives.
[http://kittytoxin.deviantart.com/journal/ The Hybrid in action: Member; A whiny little bitch/The "Draw Something Else Already" Fetishist.]

===The Pornographer (''Penis Puer'')===
These are photographers who are convinced keeping nudies in their gallery that ''"AWESOME, HOLY SHIT, DID YOU SEE THOSE TITS!?"'' will get a Daily Deviation every week as they, meanwhile, [[masturbate|vigorously]] defend their right to post their boobs, their sister's boobs, their dog's boobs, your mom's boobs, Janet Jackson's uni boob, or whomever's boobs until kingdom come. It should here be noted the admins agree with this notion: pictures of boobs and vaginae [[fapfapfap|are just intensely artistic]] (IMPORTANT: Admins also agree that male nudity similar in nature is not covered under this, due of course to blatant gayness).  Emo boys also fit into this group because they believe that taking a [[sepia]]-toned picture of their ugly face and greasy hair and blasting it with the dodge tool is "hot" or "artistic." Then they upload their abominations to the nudity section, much to the pleasure of [[retards|Ville Valo fangirls]]. Swedish dickheads like Yoshaki and Limpurtikles seems to enjoy watching [[16 year old girls]] [[rape|getting tied up.]]

===The Drive-By Propagandist (''Shitbaticus Insanicus'')===
[[Image:DeviantArt Doesnt Care.png|thumb|right|DeviantART polls always yield [[lulz|support]] and [[gtfo|understanding]].]]
These cunning deviantARTlets spew their unwelcome propaganda on their galleries and journals, and attempt to silence anyone who dares question their [[Bullshit|backwards logic]].

===The Sonic Recolourist (''Velocitas Colorare'')===
These so-called 'artists' take screenshots from [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] games and shit all over them to form pink Sonics, [[Chris-chan|yellow Sonics]], blue Tailses and lime green [[Gay|Shadows]]. ''(See Also: the cross-over effects of the [[emo]] movement evidenced by Mario's fabled brother "Luigi" shifting from his classic green composure to the less Nintendoesque "Pink vs. Black" so favored by said [[fucktards]] - user LironDe /Removed/)'' They are easily [[butthurt|enraged]] by statements that contradict the "[[Original character|incredible originality and brilliance]]" of their artwork and are quick to accuse others of "stealing" their "Green Sonic" fan-character, despite the fact that Sonic artists are only aware of 8 colours (black, white, red, green, blue, pink, yellow, and cyan.)

===The Fandom Retard (''Maria Suezae'')===
[[Image:Catbranca.jpg|thumb|right|[[Branca]], self-proclaimed wife of Stuart Tusspot, from [[Gorillaz]].]]
These people only go around drawing animu, making [[Superdemon-Inuyasha|flashy animu "art"]] [[Zeriara|of characters fucking their mother's sister's brother]], creating [[yaoi|sophisticated, stylistic portraits of males from Shojo such as]] Fruits Basket and [[Spaction3|joining crappy clubs]] but [[lie|insist they're not furries or retarded]]. For most, this is a temporary larval stage lasting until the age of 16 and metamorphose into [[MySpace|MySpace whores]], [[furries]] or [[pedophilia|pedophiles]]. They can usually be found plagiarizing, defending and kissing the ass of people who fit in ''The Popular Ass'' category, or, rarely, like [[Zeriara]], becoming jealous of [[Snapesnogger|them]] and drawing [[guro|kill art]] of their characters.

Example: *[http://shizuce-bluefire.deviantart.com/ Shizuce-Bluefire]

[[Image:LOLNARUTARD.jpg|thumb|Typical fanart request.]]

===The Fatass(AKA 'Fat/Inflation Artist') (''Fattius Asinus'')===
These so called '[[FA|Fat-Admirers]] create [[inflation art|inflated or grossly-overweight]] depictions of pre-existing or [[original character]]s with MSPaint's curve tool, or are manually drawn in pencil. They will ruthlessly defend their [[Marijuana|"art,"]] calling their personal army of [[faggots|friends]] for support at the first sight of a negative comment. Unfortunately, Fatasses continually subject innocent people to Eye[[rape]] with their awful artwork, and must be stopped. These fuckheads really need to draw something else for a change. 

===The Furry or "Anthro Artist" (''Yifficus totalis'')===
These usually cause the most drama by whining about how much everyone hates their fursonas and getting their [[Akuryou|art stolen by ten year olds]] because only THEY own the copyright to [[zeriara|lemurs]]/huskies/redpandas/''ad infinitum'', so they [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|delete all their pictures]] only to make a new deviantART account soon after.

===The Flaggot (Banius Pedocunteus)===
The term flaggot, unknown outside of [[Urban Dictionary|UrBanned Dictionary]] before the advent of [[TGcomix]] and his brand of [[16-year-old girl|self-righteous]] [[Islam|matyrdom]], is a term used to describe bastards who have the gall to report [[catholic|Saints]] who have done [[No|absolutely nothing wrong]].

Overlooking a [[LittleCloud|pedobitch]] who failed the [[O RLY?|psychological test]] for a sex change operation [[fleshlight|regularly using]] a portmanteau of "faggot," what is a flaggot? Well, to [[trap|trannies]] who march in a one-person trap-parade 24/7 and cry [[feminism|oppression]] like a [[16-year-old girl|bicurious teenage girl]], a flaggot is anyone who reports your lolicon lifts. This [[birdman|incestuous lovechild]] germinates into an organized effort by a cabal of homophobes on a site which regularly features G[[OM NOM NOM|BLT]] to get the admins, many of them passing as homosexuals, to ban someone who is as wanted as a boner at a [[Purity Ball]].

For less [[retarded|schitzophrenic]] generalizations about this particular [[incest|breed]] of DAer, see all of the preceding and successive categories.

Typical comment: ''Comment marked as spam.''

===The Cosplayer (''Imbicilae in Costumus'')===
These tartlets are actually stupid enough to get a professional photographer to take pictures of their fantastic costumes their comatose grandmother made them. The average age of the cosplayer is 24. Not surprisingly, some cosplayers give up their heterosexuality to fit in with their chosen character, and, knowing many tartlets, will give up theirs to be like their idols. Too bad they don't have a professional photog. 

Unless you're a famous cosplayer of EPIC WIN, you can attract <strike>photographers</strike> pornographers armed with HUEG cameras to shoot you more than OJ Simpson can. A perfect example for this kind of cosplayer is [[Blackmage9|Alodia]] or [http://Blackmage9.deviantart.com blackmage9] - a coswhore who is freakingly famous in her country and also some sort of a celebrity in the internet.  Alodia is about to dominate the world with her "kawaii" (a.k.a. sexual charm) talent to seduce every stalking [[fucktard]] so they can buy her prints and bid a shitload of Jewgold for all of her used [[crap|stuff]].

A subset of this tartlet is the The Poseur (''Passuer Imagica Thuivery'') who is stupid enough to plagiarize a set of images from the same cosplayer (preferably famous or in professionally-made attire), or a combination of several different cosplayers' images, regardless of nationality, body type, facial features, or even gender. The best part is that people accept the dupe as genuine, leaving rave comments and expressing their appreciation of the imposter's "talents."
[[File:fagboi.jpg|thumb|[http://bulbaboi4444.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d2d1dve Typical cosplaying pok√©fag]]]

===The Popular Ass (''Popularium Asinus'')===
[[Image:Flamers_by_Teruchan.jpg|thumb|[[Teruchan|Illustrated example of how the Popular Ass views the rest of the internets]] ]]Deviants who have more than a million pageviews and as a result, have their heads stuck up their ass.  They're usually this popular because their galleries are full of ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', [[Sonic]], [[Furry]], [[Pokemon]], [[Disney]], ''[[Nintendo|Super Smash Bros.]]'', [[Animu|Anime]], [[Naruto|Narutard]] and [[hentai]] "fanart" and they regularly threaten to leave about thirty times per week.
Posting criticism on their page results in immediate attacks by their [[Personal Army]] of retarded fans, which shows that deviantART is a place full of [[Idiot]]s and [[Fail]].

===The Emo Poet (''Plagiralus Emotalis'')===
These are the people who are too stuck-up to bother with either Myspace or LiveJournal because they believe they are [[retard|artistic]]. They can often be found redistributing copypasta from [[vampirefreaks]], trying to seem [[Gay|hardcore]]. A recently discovered relative of this species is Monglus Canus, commonly know as the Dogmongler.

'''See:''' [[Poeticirony]]

===The Emographer (''Vidarae Filia Emotalis'')===
[[Image:Peaceful_state_of_mind_by_destinytripp.jpg|thumb|Typical ID picture of the Emographer.]] Similar to the Emo Poet, these deviants deem themselves superior to their MySpace/LiveJournal counterparts, but does not differ a lot from their roots, as they enjoy posting pictures of them cutting themselves and then sucking up all of the pity that the internets has to offer.

===The HXC Moshgrapher (''Br00talis XXXila'')===
Moar [[13-year-old boys]] who upload photographs of themselves and their HXC mosh pit crew fighting ghosts at local hardcore shows. Normally stolen from [http://www.destroyalllines.com Destroy All Lines], These ''[[emo]]'' zubs will threaten with gang[[rape]] and epic flaming if their lens flare spin kick br00tal XXX mic steal pics are criticized. Note the sweat, blood (from razors) and semen on the lens.

===[[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] Crew (''Anonymus Lulzae'')===
The [[Awesome|lurkers]] of deviantART who dig up all the glorious lulz and tell the truth about this place. Be they banned or spurned, these dedicated men and [[no girls on the internet|women]] pursue their intended targets with constant vigilante and unwavering dedication.
[[Image:DAFag.jpg|thumb|left|[[suicide|Bored]] and talentless members post photos of [[fugly|themselves]].]]

===[[13 year old boys|Cheerleaders]] of [[Anonymous]] (''Anonymus Lulzae Pussia'')===
Some users of deviantART, being namefags of sorts, fear teh banhammer, but will indirectly participate, or at least cheer, from the sidelines as frontline Anonymous [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|kill the faggotry with fire]]. True Anons are encouraged to [[rape]] them until they stop being [[pussy|pussies]] and join in the [[lulz|fun]]. 
Some even act as if they [[Newfag|knew anonymous all their lives]].

==Levels of Tartlets==
[[Image:Bling.jpg|thumb|right|[[lolly]] This demonstrates where the subscribers' money goes.]]
[[Image:Da lie.jpg|thumb|right| Nobody can escape the ads.]]

=== ~Members===
Also known as "normal" tartlets, they are ubiquitous, and can be found in even the [[hell|deepest pits]] of deviantART. Members are mostly whiny little [[bitch]]es, [[furries]] and [[fags]] that post [[shit_nobody_cares_about|everything about their lives]] in their journal on a daily basis. This group mostly consists of [[retards]] who assume that posting [[shit]] [[fan art]] every single day of their pathetic lives will make them [[an hero|famous]]. They also hope to be promoted to senior members or admins, but don't realise that even deviantART rejects [[retards]] as potential material.

===*Subscribers===
[[Image:Basement_dwelling_tartlets.jpg|thumb|right|wait, how many of you live with your parents?]]
Although rare, this level contains the closest thing to ''real'' artists that deviantART has. These people are [[fucktarded]] enough to give deviantART money in return for [[sex|additional features]], and their payments form the bulk of deviantART's income. The [[admin]]z treat them as if they were their children, [[pedobear|protecting]] them from anything that might [[Offended|harm]] them, but once they realize the truth and show signs of it, the moderators will drop the [[banhammer]] on them before they can spread the truth. Once [[ban|banned]] Subscribed tartlets will beg, scream and [[cry]] for their money back, only to be told to [[STFU]] and [[GTFO]].

====Beta Testers===
Beta Testers are a sub-species of Subscribers and are also a source of deviantART's income, but instead of getting more [[shit|goodies]] than the subscribers, they actually work for deviantART by testing their [[shit no one cares about|new features]]. The only reason anyone would choose to be a Beta Tester would be for the [[masturbation|symbol]].

===`Senior Members===
[[Image:LOLLY ACCURATE.jpg|thumb|right|This is a typical Admin and Senior Member relationship.]]
[[File:Totallyhelpful.JPG|thumb|right| Expect wonderful help from [[Jackass|senior members]] such as [[Faggot|IBinsanity]].]]
Senior Members are either really [[old]] people who have been tartlets for [[at least 100 years]] or former [[admin]]istrators. [[Noone]] really likes seniors but they [[lies|pretend]] to like them in order to become Seniors themselves. The rules are simple on how to become a Senior Member on deviantART, mostly because the [[admin]]s were too fucking [[fail|lame]] to come up with anything more original than ripping off Fight Club [http://help.deviantart.com/29/].<br/>There are two types of Senior Members on deviantART:
*The [[Attention Whore]]s who think they are [[lies|PILLARS OF THE CUMMUNITY]] and must [[sex|sexually]] involve themselves in everything and everyone. These members are easily noticeable by their appearance everywhere and their constant positive attitude towards everything. They would smile, even in the face of a black person who was about to [[rape]] them and steal their car.
*The [[Internet tough guy]]s who like to run around and [[troll]] everything they can find. You'll often see them in the forums or chatrooms telling people to "fuck off" or "[[rape|take the knot]]." But the moment one of their [[admin]] friends are attacked, they rush in head first. These Senior Members are the worst kind, since no matter what they do or whoever they [[butthurt]], they will not be [[banned]] EVAR because they perform [[queening|various sexual acts]] for the [[admin]]s.

==Getting the Most out of deviantART==
[[Image:AverageUser.jpeg|thumb|She doesn't quite get it.]]
[[Image:DA loves you.png|thumb|DA [[Lie|loves you!!]]]]
As deviantART is full of [[Bullshit|wonderfully talented artists]] who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of [[Fail|Brilliance]], many [[Lulz]] can be achieved through [[Lies|complimenting their artistic superiority]] and suggesting they take their [[porn|art]] to somewhere it'll be appreciated the most: [[conceptart]].org. Several known Tartlets have easily been milked for [[lulz]] by their surprise at [[truth|constructive criticism]]. (See [[chase]]; or [[Snapesnogger]]).

1. Browse Deviantart and target [[noobs|artists]] with characteristics similar to that of the aforementioned [[lulzcow]]s. 
If [[You]] Are a [[Truth|Retard]] and cannot identify them, they are listed here:
*Unjustified self importance
*[[Assburgers]] Syndrome
*[[Anime]] [[shit|artwork]]
*[[Fantard]] of any kind
*[[Crybaby]]
*THIS IS MY STYLE!!!111oneoneeleven 
*[[Pokemon]]
*Countless other signs of [[Retard|Retardation]] or [[Fail]], which to any ED user, should be abhorrently apparent by now.

2. Follow their activity on [[conceptart|conceptart.org]]. The most commonly predictable trait exhibited is posting [[shit]] in the finally finished forum. Here, Admins and partially skilled professionals will give honest critique (And yes, I am too lazy to continue referencing) and from here the lultrain leave the station when any Tartlet will either
#Defend their art
#Tell the admins how mean they are
#Masturbate
#Tell themselves they are talented and eat a tub of Ice cream
#Or just write it off and continue posting their [[Epic]] Failures.
#Laugh

==Commenting and Favoriting==
[[Image:Liekcomments.jpg|thumb|right|[[Deviantart]] is not about the art, it's about the [[comments]].]]
[[Image:Blocked lol.PNG|thumb|You'll see this when giving a deviant an opinion.]]
[[Image:Dacrybaby.PNG|thumb|The usual reaction to someone's opinion. Note the cry for help and the number of comments received.]]
[[Image: Too late.jpeg|thumb|If you don't want the world to know, don't make it public.]]
Commenting on a deviation means giving a completely dishonest opinion of it - if the deviation happens to be just a pile of MSPaint shit, the comments it receives usually say: 'I dig your style' or 'This is so awesome FAV'D++'.  Meanwhile, a Favorite is used when a deviant can't even be arsed to write a single word.

===Wrong Way===
"[[Verbose|I must say, this is a striking image.]]  It possesses such a bright, color-rich atmosphere and I just can't take my eyes off of it.  However, I think you could have invested more time in defining the proportions during the early stages of the work because one of the girl's hands appears slightly larger than the other, even though it's further away.  You may also want to consider the placement of light sources in the picture before applying the shading.  While the light really brings it to life, it's coming from the wrong direction.  Setting that aside, I think it's a beautiful picture.  Keep up with the good work!"[[Image:Itwillneverhappen.jpg|thumb|No.]]

Or

"This seems to have taken a good amount of time and I've seen improvement in your work. The only thing I can mention is the proportions are a bit off. I saw a lovely tutorial on proportions with expressions here [link] <br>
Good luck and I think with a little more work you'll be even better! :)"

===Right Way===
*"cool."
*"First comment!"
*"OMG SOOO CUTE!! *hugs*
*"AAAAAAAAAAH THIS IS SO WRONG!!!ONE".  ''(Add more than 20 emoticons of your choice for full effect.)''
*"SUGOI KAWAII [[desu|DESU]] NE!"
*"This bad bad! But I like cause is sexy. They go bed and sex! :D "
*"Yaoi! Yay! But Inuyasha is mine!" 
*"I love that show!"
*"(:"
*<nowiki>:iconlarryplz:</nowiki>
*"[[EBay|A++++++ WOULD FAVE AGAIN]]"

===Posting Links to ED on DA===
[[File:DeviantArtspam.PNG|right|thumb|200px|Nope, it's Spam!!]]
It seems when someone posts a link to any ED article, DeviantART immediately gives you a spam prompt, thinking you're spamming the site. Oddly enough, just writing out "Encyclopedia Dramatica" doesn't trip the filter.  

[[Sarcasm|What a perfect cover for filtering out unwanted drama]]. All you need to do create a tinyurl.

==Pageviews==
[[Image:RetardART is for retards.png|thumb|left|130px|[[Attention Whores]] can drop $20 to have their shit spammed until 500 dorks click it!]]
[[Image:BUYOURSHITE.jpg|thumb|right|150px|They cut the bullshit and just want your monies NAO!]] 
Aside from drawing [[animu]], the primary goal of a tartlet is to obtain '''pageviews'''.  Remember, kids: [[Attention]] is the most vital commodity of survival to the [[emo]][[fur]] girls that comprise the bulk of deviantART's population!  Let's look at the following equation that was developed through intensive research:<br>

<div style="text-decoration:blink"><center><big>'''Page views = Attention = LIQUID SEXXX</big></center></div><br/>

Pageviews are a terrible [[drug]] that can drive a tartlet to engage in all sorts of lies, trickery and treachery.  The quest for pageviews creates great banquets of the [[drama]] on DA, where tartlets pull all sorts of stupid shit such as [[The Great Sonic-cide of 2007|faking a mass suicide]].  Scientific research has proven that tartlets cannot reach orgasm without first acquiring [[over 9000]] views of their traced fanart. This tartlet even made a [http://www.deviantart.com/view/24488859/ detailed guide] on how to be a more effective, attention-whoring cunt. [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/51366646/ This guide] contained far more effective tactics and strategies for obtaining pageviews. 

Of course, 99% of all human beings who are too fucking lazy to survive [[TL;DR]] ramblings, can just check out [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/37634905/ this submission] for a brief explanation on how to become [[popular|popularrr]] on deviantART.

[[Delthero|Be JUST like this faggot.]]

==Daily Deviations==
[[Image:One Line of Text Gets You a Feature.PNG|thumb|left|It takes literally one line of text to get a "Daily Deviation" on DeviantART.]]
[[Image:McCreepy_the_Frog_by_shebid.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[http://shebid.deviantart.com/art/McCreepy-the-Frog-107994234 An actual Daily Deviation.]]]
[[Image:Not to bear.jpg|thumb|left|Yet another [http://havesomehats.deviantart.com/art/not-to-bear-18024124 great DD]]]

Just like winning the lotto, except your chances are improved by [[Sell_Out|asskissing]] and the prize is in pageviews and flames, not money. Daily deviations (DDs) are arts that have been featured for 24 hours, give or take a day or two depending on the server lag. Considering the quality of the daily deviations chosen (see right for an example), it‚Äôs no wonder that most admins with DD-picking privileges complain about being inundated with suggestions. Fits that DDs are visible on the dA footer, which is kind of like the [[asshole]] of the whole site. 

Regarding [http://shebid.deviantart.com/art/McCreepy-the-Frog-107994234 McCreepy the Frog]‚Ä¶ moonbeam13 initially awarded the DD. Much [[BAWW|butthurt]] ensued, both at the ‚Äòartist‚Äô and the DD selector. The next morning, moonbeam13 posted [http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/22329023/ a journal] explaining that she didn‚Äôt mean to award it a DD - it was to test out the new DD system, and she hadn‚Äôt removed it properly before going to bed. She then removed the DD. Soon after, Purpleblur re-awarded a DD to McCreepy the Frog, just to assert that mod powah is absolute and to stick it to the whiny bitches that actually wanted to see art. This makes it the only piece on dA that was deliberately featured for 48 hours straight, and thus the most important Daily Deviation to exist.

==Groups==
A relatively new way for "artists" to get noticed. Groups are a weak attempt by the admins to give members a feeling of self-worth and general acceptance, thus why they're called "groups." They're basically a bunch of fetish junkies who want to up their [[popularity]] but posting their "[[art]]s" for other like minded individuals. 


==Getting Banned==
[[Image:DA Banning DArtboard System.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Official Banning System of the deviantART Staff.]]
[[Image:Instant Ban from DA.jpg|thumb|90px|right|"Posting this in your deviantART gallery will get you banned in under 30 seconds, or your money back!" (UPDATE: Patcheresu tried it 12.22.10 and got watched for it by Hanyou-San. WTF)]]

There are various ways in which you could get your ass [[banned]] from deviantART.  They include:
*Making a favorite category called "retarded crap" then adding every deviation to it.
*Making any kind of comment, positive or negative, on a Daily Deviation (Usually a piece of porn that's featured for a day).
*Don't suck [[Japan]]'s [[dick]].
*Being a bad reference to the site (i.e. getting an Encyclopedia Dramatica article).
*Putting crap in the wrong category.
*Trolling (that's an easy one, especially now that tartlets don't have to BAWWWWW to the mods every time due to the recent addition of a "Report [[Copypasta|Spam]]" button).
*Promoting warez.
*Labeling another deviant as "[[bitch]]" (see [[Bleedman]]).
*Jokingly referring to another deviant as a "godless devil-worshipper".
*Having ever visited any *[[chan]] board.
*Pointing out the really very manly mustache that the admin [[chix0r]] has.
*Linking to [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] articles with the aim of potential [[lulz]].
*Asking people if they liek [[mudkip]] ([http://comments.deviantart.com/4/3341527/386543768 ref]).
*Opposing [[Animal cruelty|animal abuse]] (see [[poeticirony]]).
*Being a fan of [[EncyclopediaDramatica]].  The [[moderator]]s will get even more [[butthurt|upset]] if you mention it on deviantART, particularly on the profile of a [[moderator]].
*Questioning anything on the site.
*Contacting someone who has blocked you (place of contact has to be outside of their userpage, thus making the Block system utterly worthless).
*Trolling the forums complaining about how Fanart should not be featured (it should be killed with fire). Be prepared for incoming eBaumfags, weeaboos, and artfags. Many lulz and drama will ensue.

Many potential [[lulz]] exist when doing any of the above.  The users and administrators do not like criticism of any form, people who are opposed to [[anime]] [[porn]], and people who are in touch with the outside world.  They prefer the [[basement dwellers|type of people]] who will throw away money for the site (this act has been named "subscription")

It should be noted that if you laugh too hard at the [[retard|artists]] on their site, you will be banned in spite of your subscription status.  If you're a masochist/[[no friends|have nothing else to do with your life]] and decide to make a new account after getting banned, then the admins will hunt you down and ban your new account in between sucking [[Snapesnogger]] and [[Teruchan|Teruchan's]] dicks.  In other words: why the fuck are you making a new account there in the first place?

==Llamas==

[[Image:llama_list_to_10_000_by_cowpi.png|thumb|120px|right|Someone kill me now.]]

In late March of 2010, deviantTART added a new feature guaranteed to cause more idiotic [[drama|drama.]] Llama badges. These stupid things are now worth more than pageviews, as a they have spawned numerous groups and pages of [[retards|people]] clamoring for them. As an added bonus, the badge levels up as you receive a certain number of them, which makes every TARTlet want [[all caps|FUCKING MOAR!!!]]. Not so recently an addition was made to the Llama madness when DeviantART added the ability to literally [[scam|buy]] accessories for your Llamas along with the llamas themselves. In an effort to control the madness DeviantART added an annoying [[Spam]] Filter, which popped up after giving a few dozen llamas, to provoke even more drama DeviatART decided to replace the filter message with a different one telling users they didn't have enough points to complete the transaction and requesting them to purchase more points.

==The Points System==
[[Image:Give a friend PMS.PNG|thumb|120px|right|A typical tarlet donation pool.]]
DeviantART has a system of [[money|points]] that serve as on site [[scam|credits]], Tartlets often treat these points like gold and beg for them like a Jew. These points can only be used on-site, and it takes [[over 9,000]] of them just to get even the most basic of uses out of them. Most Tartlets will start a donation pool to get more points so they can buy stuff. Points are commonly exchanged for even more Llamas, and there is even an [http://llamatrade.deviantart.com/ exchange] dedicated to the trade of worthless Llamas for points, most Tarlets are unaware of this system and will often beg for points on their page in exchange for Llama's, comments, watches, faves, and even commissions. 

As of [[2011|January 2011]] many deviants received a rude awakening to the struggles of the [[real world]], when DeviantART started to penalize Deviants for accepting "[[Scam|Fraudulent Points]]" from other members on the site. This resulted in the first official DeviantART [[Poverty|Debt Crisis]] of the current recession. This lead many of DeviantART's beggars and businesspeople to be put into [[poor|debt]] with their negative point balances. 

==Adoptables==
Adoptables are the disease of deviantart that Jew use to get watchers or [[money|points]]. every [[furry]] on deviantart has made one in their time. Adoptables usually have a system where you give the fugly mismatched coloured [[sparkledog|character]] a name then draw it in your style. It usually results in butthurt failures crying because [insert username including the word [[wolf|wolf]] here] did not draw the doggie within 3 days of "claiming" it. The other way is to send points that they use to buy other even uglier designs. Users that make adoptables cry if you insult their [[fail|pretty]] designs... hint hint.

#The whole world is only waiting for one thing: seeing [[Ugly|me]] [[Camwhore|naked]]

#It‚Äôs not paedophilia [[Bleedman|when I draw it]]

#I have more [[Buttsecks|pageviews]], therefore my art is better than yours
#Making [[Sockpuppet|alternate accounts]] praising my main account is a brilliant tactic
#[[Copypasta|Copy-pasting]] an ‚ÄúI like your art‚Äù comment on loads of Random Deviant pages without looking at the art is a brilliant tactic
#Making a thread in the [[Orgy|ThumbShare forum]], dedicated [[Unwarranted self importance|only to me]] with the sole intention of [[Bukkake|throwing my own art into everyone's faces]] is a brilliant tactic  
#No matter how crappy my art is, and regardless of the fact that no one would hang it on their wall to save their lives, I must still make all my art available as Prints

#My desktop picture must contain a [[World of Warcraft]]-icon, and the wallpaper may under no circumstance have the correct aspect ratio
#I paid Jew for my account, so everything I made has just become [[E-penis|better]] than everything you‚Äôll ever make

#I must always be proud of making the first comment, even when I have nothing more to write than, ‚ÄúFirst comment!‚Äù
#I can always [[Delete_fucking_everything|delete my account]] and make a new one

==April Fools 2008==
<center>[[Image:Herduliek.gif|100px]]</center>
On April 1st, 2008, the deviantART crew, in a fail attempt to seem "Internets hip", decided to make an [[April Fools]] Joke by turning everyone's icon (including those who lacked one) into [[Mudkips]]. Unfortunately, they failed to realize that not everyone on their site is a [[4chan|sick fuck weeaboo who spends his free time in the basement fapping to Mudkip pr0n]]. 

Almost instantly, whiny teenage [[emo]]s overran the Help Desk, Help Chat and [[Complaints Forum]], asking essentially the same thing: "'''Why is my icon a [[Mudkip]]?'''"  When these butthurt "artists" attempted to revert their icons back to normal in order to accurately reflect their [[weeaboo|individuality]] and unique-isity, their efforts were met with a strange error message: <br>
{{q2|[[lulz|u dont liek mudkips?]]}}<br>
{{clear}}
and it was a fail

==April Fools 2010==
Two years after the Mudkips incident, deviantArt tried again to make an April Fool's joke, and failed again, unless somehow provoking unbridled amounts of rage and whining is their idea of a reaction to a successful prank. This time around they replace everyone's icons (and signatures as well this time) with Twilight and Lady Gaga-based stuff, possibly due to any reasonable person going "WTF" in the face of such things.

==DevianTart Gender Wank November 2010==

[[Last Thursday|During a recent upgrade]], DevianTart decided everyone on the site had to specify their gender as male or female. When confronted with this fact, [http://transfinite.dreamwidth.org/215469.html transfinite] asked [[WTF|WTF]] and many Tartstaff answered [[your mom|your mom]] and showed just [[pedobear|what kind of tartlet]] they're [[fap|looking]] for.

Despite their [[butthurt|anger]], many tartlets can't bring themselves to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|deactivate their accounts]] because then where would they [[Sheezyart|go]]?

==1,000 Image Search Limit==

Just in time for the [[Christmas|2010 Holiday Season]], DeviantART decided to add a search limit to the number of results a person can see. This resulted in almost immediate [[RAGE]] by the [[Tartlet]] community, once they realized they could no longer view hidden [[Lie|masterpieces]] of the wonderful worlds of [[Pokemon]], [[Twilight]], [[Harry Potter]], [[Naruto]], and [[Vocaloid]]. This resulted in many [[Fake|Internet Protests]] on and of the site and a surge in Forum activity, to which the admins said that they really didn't give a damn.
