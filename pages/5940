Oekaki (お絵描き) is a [[Japanese]] term meaning to "doodle" or "scribble". On a Oekaki website, you can typically draw online using your browser and submit directly to the website. They are usually run by jealous [[Nazi|admins]] who will only delete something if it is [[lie|not original or has not been worked on whole-heartedly.]] Most of the communities consist of [[weeaboos|weeaboos]], who draw shitty fanart of [[Naruto]], [[Inuyasha]] and [[lie| other such wonderful shows]].

OeCOCKy also stands for all the [[cock]] you have to suck to get [[age|compliments]] on your [[shit|amazing]] arts.

==Standards==
Major oekakis, such as [http://sroekakia.com/oekaki Suta Raito Oekaki,] are VERY difficult to get into. You have to be a [[faggot|wonderful artist]], draw [[furries|animals]], and you must always remember to [[Do_it_for_the_lulz|provide accurate and helpful criticism]] or else they'll have [[butthurt| to tattle to the admins]].
