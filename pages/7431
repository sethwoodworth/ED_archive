Sharon Lopatka
[[Image:Sharon Lopatka.jpg|thumb|Oh, baby.]]
'''Sharon Lopatka''' was a [[fat]] Jew from [[Maryland]] who was a bit too into [[BDSM]]. Using the Internet, where she also sold sick [[porn]] and totally [[fake|legit]] psychic readings, she posted a classified seeking someone to torture and kill her.  After contacting several people who, shockingly, turned out to be joking, she finally found a sick fuck willing to fulfill her request. 

She was tortured and strangled to death in October, 1996, for the purpose of mutual sexual gratification by Robert Frederick Glass aka "[[fap|Slowhand]]", a [[Computer_Science_III|computer analyst]] from North Carolina.  [[Samuel L. Jackson|Mr. Glass]], being the dumbass white trash that he is, buried Sharon ''right outside his goddamned trailer'' instead of the expansive woods nearby, leading police to find the body as soon as they started looking. This [[idiot|criminal mastermind]] was unsurprisingly later found to be in possession of [[child porn|kiddie porn]], and Sharon's things.  Further proving what a shithole North Carolina is, Glass pleaded a manslaughter charge and got off with around 3 years in prison.  Luckily, he died of a heart attack about 2 years later.  This is a classic case of two birds with one stone.
