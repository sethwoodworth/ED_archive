'''Wikileaks''' is a [[website]] that poses as a free for all [[wiki]] site to allow [[anonymous]] people of all countries to release classified [[government]] and [[corporate]] [[dox|documents]] [[for the lulz]], thus giving any snitch in any position of power in any country the incentive to disobey top-secret orders and betray his country for [[profit]].  It's run by [[Barack Obama]]'s evil albino twin [[australia|Julian Assange]], whose own white messianic rise to power mirrors that of [[Black Jesus]].  Its inevitable that they will have to face each other in a fight to the death in the near future.
 
[[Some argue|Some say]] it a good site to [[troll]] governments and other organizations and [[the man]] is constantly trying to [[censor]] it.  The quality of trolling by Wikileaks has been so high, that there is no government or corporation on this earth that does not want Assange dead.

If you thought that [[Wikipedia]] had a massive case of [[unwarranted self-importance]] when it claimed to be "the sum of all human knowledge", just [http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:About#Why_is_Wikileaks_so_important.3F try this one on for size]:

[[File:assangefag.jpg|thumb|Typical Assange fag.]]{{quote|We believe Wikileaks is the strongest way we have of generating the true democracy and good governance on which '''all''' mankind's dreams depend.|Some [[TL;DR]] shit backs up this highly '''bold''' statement.}}

Yeah, so you've told us that Wikileaks is the ultimate revolutionary [[moralfag]] site... [[cool story bro]]!

[[Some argue]] Wikileaks is, in fact, a cover-up site made by [[the man]]. They point out that instead of providing us with crucial information for revolutionary practices (i.e. the location of secret [[jew gold]] deposit, technical detail of nano-biochip which is going to be clandestinely implemented to every single non-jew, and [[Illuminati]]'s plan on human extinction of year [[2012]]), the wiki itself is full of [[shit nobody cares about]].

Wikileaks also let us know the interesting [[fact]] that [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] was on the [[Australian]] government's [[IWF|list of blacklisted websites]]. We can't show enough just how grateful we are for being kept in the know. It is best not to [[rage]] about internet censorship because we all know that the people coming up with these blacklists are nothing more than [[epic]] [[trolls]] themselves and are doing it for the [[Xzibit|lulz of watching us not have our lulz]].

<center><s>The U.S. Department of Defense is currently "looking" for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. He is in [[England]].</s>He was arrested in Sweden for being an apparant [[rape|sex offender]].</center>
<br>
[[File:Takingitseriously.jpg|center]]
<br/>
Assange is a couch surfer and has no [[dox|actual physical address]], preferring to crash at friend's houses for extended periods, making him constantly on the move. As such, it's been very challenging for the Feds to locate him.

How do you go about finding someone who is hard to find? Why, you accuse them of [[rape]], of course. Swedish officials issued a warrant for Assange's arrest on charges of suspicion of "[[bullshit|rape and molestation]]". After realizing that people aren't totally stupid, and completely saw right through this transparent attempt to apprehend Assange, the Swedish government then promptly withdrew the warrant. They said there "wasn't enough evidence to support the charges".

Swedish officials have now <i>re-issued</i> the arrest warrant for Assange, this time as an international one. Apparently, not having enough evidence is not a factor, when [[USA|Uncle Sam]] says jump YOU'D BETTER FUCKING JUMP.

*http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/international/Prosecutor-Wants-WikiLeaks-Boss-Arrested-For-Rape-20101118-ncx

BREAKING LULZ! Assange turned himself in to the British police, but when told he'd have to go back to Sweeden for a trial, he said "Aw hell naw!" Further muddying the waters, Ardin has absconded to the Israeli occupied territories in full Muslim head gear, leaving the Swedish prosecutrix to pretty much fondle herself with the dead case material. Meanwhile, the Arabic-language newspaper Syria Truth has published an interview with former MickyLeaks Club mouskateer Daniel Schidt, aka Daniel Schmitt, aka some fucking long double German last name, where he spills that Assange met in Geneva with an "unofficial" Israeli official last spring to cut a deal on keeping sensitive material out of the cablebait "leaks," and that Assange made out like a bandit in the deal. Of course Schnitt has everything to gain by pinning graft, corruption and Mossad deals on Assange now, and is feeling massively butthurt he left the mouse clubhouse just before the real edrama commenced. Syria, Israel, Palestine, Geneva--all the makings of a lame spy thriller like the kind lulzmeister E. Howard Hunt used to pen during his off-time when he wasn't assassinating JFK and stuff. Adding to the hint of jewgoldz at work: Sofia Vilen, an obvious pseudonym based on Monica Lewinsky-Vilenski, who will now produce an OMG dress with stains PROVING RAEP.

==Alleged CIA connections of the accusers (you can't make this shit up)==

Soon after the identities of "Miss A" (because she took it in the ass) and "Miss W" (because she took it in the "wagina", Swedish spelling) became known, rumors of CIA-[[prostitute|honeytrapping]] emerged. This enraged Claes Borgström, the lawyer of the two new-fledged [[rule 34]]-superstars. "How can anyone dare to say that?" he [[drama|shrieked]]. The [[cum]] really hit the [[bukkake]]-fan when a secret CIA spokesperson pointed out that both Missy Ass and Missy Wagina are way too [[fugly]] to be eligible for prostitution for the Central Intelligence Agency. From the official statement: "The agency trains and employs only 10s for copulation. Ardin and Wilen are only 2s or 3s. Any gentleman will tell you: that's active anilingus material at best, so that one does not need to see the fugly face. Wiles is even overweight -- I mean, come on! Just look at them!" This enraged Claes Borgström, the laywer of the two new-fledged non-prostitutes. "How can anyone dare to say that?" he [[drama|shrieked]]. The [[lulz]] are on Julian Assange now, who has shown surprisingly little class in regard to his [[sex|copulation]] partners. Julian probably [[fap]]s to the swim-suit section in his mother's old Sears-Roebuck catalogs.  

==The Wikileaks Massive Dox Dump==
[[File:Lolwikileaks.jpg|thumb|]]

On October 22, 2010, Wikileaks released a gigantic trove of [[US]] military documents related to the [[Iraq|Iraq War]]. There were [[tl;dr|391,832 documents]] released in all, revealing approximately 15,000 previously unaccounted for deaths. As analysts make their way through the stack of documents, more and more information comes to the surface. While the Pentagon and the White House scramble around in damage control mode, Hasbro intends to make lemonade out of lemons by coming out with their latest installment of Trivial Pursuit: The Iraq War Edition.<br>
'''Did you know...'''
# [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/23/world/la-fg-iraq-wikileaks-20101023 ...Iraqi forces were much better at Abu Ghraibing prisoners than the US?]
# [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/world/middleeast/23casualties.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all ...secret body counts were being tallied while publicly they were denied?]
# [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/world/middleeast/23iran.html?pagewanted=al ...that Iran actually <i>was</i> providing most of the support for the insurgency?]
<br>
After the dumping of the [[dox]], interview requests poured in for Mr. Assange. As someone who sees himself as an [[hippy|anti-war activist]], Julian is more than happy to engage in a discussion about resulting [[lulz]]. Curiously though, there are apparently some topics for him that are off limits. While he's perfectly content to drop the names of Iraqis working with the US who will probably now get skinned and boiled alive, talking about "raped" Swedish CIA agents seems to be out of the question.

==The Gigantic Cable Dump of November 2010==
[[File:Julian wikileaks.jpg|right|thumb|Julian Badassange]]
On November 28, 2010 Wikileaks started publishing a small section of the total 251,287 cables sent to the US government from various embassies around the world. A mixed bag of top secret and kind-of-secret reports, most of which gave scathing assessments of world leaders and their policies, through the eyes of the US ambassadors sent abroad:
<br>
*[[Pakistan|PAKISTAN]]: US believes that they, under [[rape|economic pressure]], may sell enriched Uranium (capable of making a nuke) to [[Islam|terrorists]]
*[[China|CHINA]]: China discusses a unified Korea under [[Good Korea|South Korean]] rule, and say they will make it happen by leaving [[Best Korea|North Korea]] to decline by itself and letting it collapse after the death of its official religious deity, Kim Jong-il
*[[Good Korea|SOUTH KOREA]]: US and [[Good Korea|South Korea]] discussed a unified Korea, and SK has considered [[whore|commercial inducements]] to [[China]] in order to get it
*[[Torture|GUANTANAMO BAY]]: The US has pressured countries to take prisoners from there (into their own prisons) in return for [[sex|favors]]
*[[Afghanistan|AFGHANISTAN]]: The Afghan Vice-President was found with $52million in cash when visiting UAE ([[implying]] massive levels of [[coke and hookers|corruption]])
*[[China|CHINA]]: China really did hack Google China, and has also hacked [[USA|western government]] and [[Microsoft|corporate PCs]]
*[[Saudi Arabia|SAUDI ARABIA]]: [[Obvious|Saudi donors are still the chief sponsors of Al Qaeda]] + King Abdullah dislikes Iraqi and Pakistani leaders. No shit, sherlock. We've known this for a quarter century.
*[[Russia|RUSSIA]]: Putin and Berlusconi are [[bff|butt buddies]] to the point that Berlusconi is Russia's [[blowjob|mouthpiece]] in Europe [[buttsecks|(talk of lavish gifts both ways)]]                
*[[Germany|GERMANY]]: US warned Germany not to arrest [[spies|CIA officers]] involved in a bungled kidnapping of a German civilian
*[[Israel|ISRAEL]]: Israel planned to strike [[Iran]] offensively if Iran continues nuclear development. Israel's intention for the blockade of Gaza was to keep Gaza perpetually "[[Blueballs|on the brink of collapse]] without [[ejaculation|pushing it over the edge]]."
*[[Yemen|YEMEN]]: Took credit on US' request for missile strike on Al Qaeda. Got high and partied with the fine herbage. Requested [[moar|MOAR BOOZE]]. 
*[[Iran|IRAN]]: US is getting increasingly worried that Iran has the capabilities to produce Uranium. [[Godwin's Law|Ahmadinejad was also compared to Hitler.]]
*LIBYA: Dictator Qaddafi has a [[mail order bride|"Ukrainian nurse"]] companion that never leaves his side + he reneged on a deal to return uranium to Russia, after having loaned it to a scientist for a project involving a stainless steel car. Now, Russia wants its woman back.
*[[Britain|BRITAIN]]: Cameron has been reported to be "easily intimidated" and "indecisive" by US Intelligence
*[[Argentina|ARGENTINA]]: Hillary Clinton wanted to know if President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is a [[latina|batshit crazy bitch and if she was taking drugs.]] 
*[[Venezuela|VENEZUELA]]: Chavez should be [[Dying Alone|isolated from the world]].
*[[United Nations|U.N.]]: Hillary Clinton ordered U.S. diplomats to spy on diplomats of other nations at the U.N. which is, ironically, completely b& by the U.N. Charter. She even went as far as ordering them to gather [[Semen|DNA]], [[grope|fingerprints]], [[stare|iris scans]], [[fraud|credit card numbers]], and frequent flier numbers of other diplomats.
<br>
[[Obama]] has had a tough time speaking out against the biggest security leak in history since he basically campaigned on the idea of making government more "transparent". White House speech writers have suggested that he have a press conference in front of a banner that says "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED". Fuck Yeah, America!

Meanwhile, as the new congress prepares to take their seats, they're already toying with the idea of having Wikileaks declared a [[terrorist]] organization. Run Julian, run.
[[File:AssangeInterpLOL.JPG|thumb|left|Wanted by the Interpol. For crimes of [[secks|love]].]]<br />
On November 30th, 2010, [[Interpol]] added Julian Assange to their "Most Wanted" list. Move over Lupin the III.

==The Insurance File==
Super secret file, so dramatic that it comes with aes256 encryption. Wikileaks encourages people to mirror this file whenever they get ready to drop some massive damage. Once you have the key for it (Little Orphan Annie decoder ring), and wasted time downloading all 1.4 Gigs, you crack it open revealing the secret texts to find they just held down ctrl+v a few million times. It reads "Be sure to drink your Ovaltine."

SPOILER: The key is ONION, [[Lies|srsly.]]

==America's response==
<center>{{bigpic|Blow it out your ass.png|714|350}}</center>

==Trolling Wikileaks==
Wikileaks is harder than most wikis to troll because it isn't actually a wiki, i.e. an online database that anyone can edit.  It's a database that a select few can edit, so unless you're one of those few then [[vandalism]] is out of the question.  It does however have a [https://chat.wikileaks.org/ chat room].  For beginner trolling, drop in on a chat (probably a discussion of Wikileaks's ongoing legal battles) and start out with, "Can you guyz show me where to find..."

* [[Black Jesus|Barack Obama's]] Kenyan birth certificate
* the classified scientific studies of [[Yeti|Bigfoot]], including locations of government facilities where live specimens are held
* the [[docs|official government documents]] on the [[Area 51|Roswell alien invasion of the 1940s and the subsequent alien autopsy reports]]
* the [[W|White House]] [[Jews did WTC|9/11 planning memos]]
* the [[Final Fantasy|Final Fantasy XIV]] beta (tell them it's okay if it's in Japanese)
* the [[Harry Potter|Harry Potter 7 working copy]]

Since you may not get very far this way (being one voice asking about Sasquatch among many voices discussing Wikileaks's ongoing legal proceedings), it would be beneficial to orchestrate a raid and bring in 700 of your closest [[/b/tard|/b/tards]] (or [[sock puppet|sock puppets]]) all avidly discussing the government cover-up of Bigfoot. (Discuss how the likely reason for the cover-up is to appease [[christfags]] who would [[shit brix]] if a the discovery of the [[Creationism|missing link]] were made public.)

Intermediate trolling would be to approach any of the above in a more subtle manner, e.g. "I'm having difficulty finding any documents relating to the [[Messin' With Sasquatch|indigenous Hominoid population of the Pacific Northwest and adjacent sections of Canada]].  Can anyone point me in the right direction?" This technique appears to have been made known to JP "Patches" Assange, who recently turned the tables on would-be vandals by announcing he has sekrit dox on UFOs among the State Department cables.

Another intermediate and perhaps more rewarding course of trolling would be to tell them that they have [[9000|over 100,000]] documents, 99.7% of which are [[shit no one cares about|semi-classified bullshit that even the Pentagon barely gives a fuck about their having]], but don't have jack shit on anything actually relevant. (Mention the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Tillman official Army coverup of the Pat Tillman murder] for lulz.)

Also, tell them that because they aren't leaking documents that agree with your conspiracy theory, then he must but a CIA shill.

A highly advanced form of trolling Wikileaks would be to submit a fake [http://www.newworldorderwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/lucassmithkenyabirthcertificate.jpg document], [http://0.tqn.com/d/paranormal/1/0/3/B/loch_ness_1_lg.jpg image], or [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzmmlaZ9b9I video] pertaining to any of the above and actually have it published to the site.  This is advanced because they have to employ a rigorous vetting process (or so they claim).

A truly advanced troll would be to submit video evidence of Assange's [[Rape|Rape]] of swedish CIA agents, but the most epic troll would be for Assange himself to submit the tape via the wiki.

==Trolled by the Feds==
In an epic example of [[Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this|payback]], the [[Rape|US]] [[Robot|Government]] donned its trollface again and all but obliterated the revenue streams for WikiLeaks by leaning on [[PayPal]] and [[Amazon]] until they [[b&]] the leaky wiki. They managed to get EveryDNS to remove its entry for wikileaks.org (but not to worry, there are plenty of [http://wikileaks.ch/mirrors.html mirrors]). The Feds then managed to get VISA and Mastercard to stop card payments to Wikileaks.  They've also tried to stop young people from reading it by threatening them with being barred from [[Welfare|government jobs]] in the future.

==[[Gay|Mastercard]] is taken out==


On December 8th, Mastercard's site was taken out by Operation Payback, hours before its previous statement "They have not disrupted our means of payment." Hours later, the results of Anon's [[Ddos]] attack was shown:

{{quote|On Wednesday, a largely anonymous Internet group, called Operation Payback, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Later that day, [[Gay|Mastercard]] got trolled by [[britfag|DJ Korax]] from AnonOps official radio by prankcalling their support line.

==Operation Pay/b/ACKLASH==
On December 11 the first arrests concerning Operation Payback were made. The first to go down is a [http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/12/first-arrest-made-in-wikileaks-revenge-attacks.ars|Dutch 16-year-old boy], who has been arrested by the Dutch High Tech Crime Team and is being held for interrogation. Moot has commented that he hopes this string of arrests helps clean [[B/]] of underaged so called "[[hackers]]" script-kiddies.

Since his release from jail, Jullian Assange has been using the phrase [[The Internet is serious business|"serious business"]] in interviews repeatedly. Ex. "Just another idiot trying to make a name for himself.  It's <s>a</s> serious business." [[No|Could this be some subtle way of giving Anonymous a "shout out"]] for [[USI|their efforts]]?

==Let's throw some Jew-hatred into the mix, shall we?==
[[File:Assangeandfriend.jpg|right|thumb|Julian Assange and Israel Shamir plot the destruction of world Jewry.]]
In mid-December, [[old media|several media outlets]] began to report that Assange was collaborating with the notorious anti-semite [[Israel]] Shamir, who is in fact listed as the Wikileaks spokesperson for [[Russia]]. Shamir's equally Jew-hating son is listed as the Wikileaks spokesperson for Scandinavia.

==Book Deal==

JP reportedly recently signed a deal to put his brand oops name on a ghost-written tell-all major full-release book in exchange for $1.5 million, to be used for "legal fees." JP's email addresses, editor@wikileaks.org me@iq.org and proff@iq.org, immediately went dead upon completion of the book deal, aka "donation." Sources close to the actual newspapers carrying the story claim Jews run the publishing house involved.
