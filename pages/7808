'''Stephen Hawking''' is the world's most famous cybernetically augmented [[pedophile]].  He is a [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and [[leet|Computer Science XVII]] [[hacker|graduate]] with an unfortunate disorder that makes him talk like an old [[Mac]]. He's a lot like a modern-day Galileo, if you happened to leave Galileo in the microwave for too long. Coincidentally, Hawking was born exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo. The comparisons end there however, as Galileo was able to wipe his own ass. 
Stephen Hawking is the only known [[retard]] to have contributed to society by writing a book that [[noone]] wants to read. Often when you explain to bleeding heart liberals that all retards and cripples should be left by the side of a mountain to die a la Spartan times they bring up the [[fact]] that Stephen Hawking is all up in their [[shit]] and he's [[awesome]]. Even though [[Nobody cares|nobody knows]] what that robot voice is talking about. They miss the point though, [-] as Stephen Hawking was born on a wheelchair[/-] He was only diagnosed at 21. So it's still [[truth|totally right]] to dispose of retards born that way. It is proven that Hawking is the biggest player ever and gets more pussy than all [[porn]] stars combined. He supposedly has the hardest wood ever.


== [[God hates fags|God hates Steven...]] ==

Professor Hawking contracted Motorneurone disease after a disastrous attempt to [[divide by zero]], using a Speak n Spell machine. Some say that he actually succeeded, and in that instant, all the secrets of the universe were revealed to him in a blinding light. Steven's body could no longer cope with all that information, and chose to shut itself down, in order to save energy for his precious brain.

== ...so does his wife. ==

A while back, the window licking genius was taken to hospital with unexplained injuries, including a broken wrist, gashes to the face and a cut lip ([[drugs|meth]] addict?).  His nurse claimed that is was the doing of his second wife.  In any case this proves 2 things, a) that the boy knows how to party, and 2) that if Steven can get pussy ([[at least 100|at least twice]]), then so can [[YOU]]!

== He is British ==

Stephen, as it is actually spelled, is [[Lies|British]]. He is a fine example of the British education system, however, Americans being American will no doubt claim that Stephen is one of them. Once his immediate family are dead and all the media have forgotten about him, they shall slowly start publishing fraudulent text books claiming he was of [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|American]] heritage.

== Really sick? ==

[[Some argue|It has been speculated]] that Prof. Hawking is just [[lazy]], and enjoys having his [[goatse|ass]] wiped by a nurse. He ''is'' the smartest guy in the world after all, and who can blame him?

== New Theories ==
On Sunday, April 25th, 2010, the world's smartest man said one of the stupidest things possible. Professor Hawking stated that aliens may very well exist, but that we should avoid them at all costs so they don't sell us into slavery.
{{quote|If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the [[Native Americans]].|Stephen Hawking}}
