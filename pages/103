4chan fgt hat day
Every year [[4chan]] celebrates its birthday on October 1st by putting hats on random pictures and fagging up every post, lulz ensues.

==Example - Dave becomes [[an hero]] ==

== Party Hats Kill /b/ ==

On October 1st, 2009, it is theorized that /b/ was shut down due to party hats somehow freezing the board. All Pictures were deleted and you couldn't post, it was almost as if /b/ was frozen itself.
