Staging ground for [[colorbar]]s, self-praise, and general [[wank]].  It displays your default [[icon]], as well as [[shit nobody cares about|any personal information]] you have chosen to let people laugh at.  Some people consider reading userinfo a form of [[Internet stalking]].

Userinfo varies greatly between [[LJ User|LJ users]], from the [http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=jameth absurdly concise] to [http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=paigegirl endless reams of text and images].  It is primarily accessed only by [[lamers]], and/or during a [[flame war]].

== I can't believe they said that... ==
Often, on their userinfo, people who think they are an [[internet celebrity]] will have testimonies about themselves from other people they think are internet celebrities.  Sometimes these testimonies will be negative, in order to prove that the LJ user can laugh at themselves.

'''This is a lie.''' The seriousness with which an LJ user takes the [[Internet]] is directly proportional to their need to prove how unseriously they take the internet.  These users will still sob into their pillows once you tell them that [[You Don't Have Any Friends|they don't have any friends]].


== Communities ==
Userinfo for a [[community]] is effectively the same as for a user, but will generally include a statement of intent, the [[moderator|moderator(s)]] [[journal|journal(s)]], and the rules which you can break in order to get [[ban set|banned]].  Community userinfo is [[old meme|never funny or interesting]], regardless of how serious the community is.
