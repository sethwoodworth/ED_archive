'''Hipocrite''' is a hypocrite and an all-around [[Semen|cumbucket]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cindery&diff=prev&oldid=102372743 He] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&diff=prev&oldid=102365843 has] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Reference_desk&diff=prev&oldid=101843949 no] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Democratic_Underground&diff=prev&oldid=69592399 grasp of] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:External_links&diff=prev&oldid=100181241 civil behavior]. When the ED article was up for deletion during EDGate2006, he [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Merovingian&diff=prev&oldid=64728304 tried to recall a kindly admin] that voted to "keep" ED. Hypocrite hangs to the coattails of his admin account [[MONGO]] like shit to a bearâ€™s arse. He is a [[bureaucratic fuck]] of [[Bible|Biblical]] proportion, and a wannabe Wiki admin. He also appears to be a [[Shit|good]] wannabe journalist named [http://www.truthinmedia.org/truthinmedia/bob.html Bob Djurdjevic].  Hipocrite is a well seasoned troll who has been around since the days of the [[Usenet]] [[Meow Wars]].

==Unretired, tell Jeff Merkey!==
Hipocrite is back as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:PouponOnToast User:PouponOnToast] on TOW! Tell Jeff Merkey, he probably wants Hipo's new IPs for some legal threats.

==His name defines him==
[[Image:HipocriteMUMU.jpg|thumb|230px|Hipocrite enjoys wearing mu mu's when out on the town.]]
But of course he cares about policy, so much that he nuked a full length article into a THREE SENTENCE STUB. He has been requested to trim up the article on uncyclopedia, which borderlines on fellatio. He routinely violates [[Tony Sidaway|WP:DICK]], [[MONGO|WP:ASSHOLE]], and [[Jimbo Wales|WP:DOUCHE]] and yet hides behind Wikipedia policy to justify his shameless trolling, whilst all the while baiting other legitimate editors into flame wars [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FMONGO_%28second_RfC%29&diff=65528677&oldid=65519559] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHipocrite%2Fdevnul&diff=65528221&oldid=64731216].

===More Hypocrisy===
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=66000344 EXAMPLE: juvenile comment "get my wikidick sucked" right after saying someone else was a troll] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=66009166 Then continues with troll comment]  Are we sure he's not a child?

===Criticized for vandalizing other people's work===
Hipocrite also edits with an attitude that he is [[God]], and it was once attempted to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Hipocrite hold him accountable] by people not afraid of his inevitable hurling of his own feces. As always, when cornered with proof of his bullshit, he shoved his flaccid [[penis]] in his right hand and begin rocking back and forth, chanting "Troll sockpuppet, troll meatpuppet, puppet puppet troll," while licking out the [[anus]] of a $5 [[hooker]] he picked up.

Unfortunately, [[MONGO]] rigged the Request for Comment and MONGO banned anyone who said anything negative about his sockpuppet, Hipocrite, forever. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=MONGO&page=User%3ASoftPaleColors] Then MONGO hides the negative comments. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FHipocrite&diff=67048018&oldid=67046610]  When someone reverts MONGO's coverup, MONGO bans them, too. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=MONGO&page=User%3AKarwynn]  Then MONGO hides it again. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FHipocrite&diff=67051370&oldid=67049707]

==What Hipocrite's fans are saying!==	 
* "Hipocrite is the kind of character for whom theory proves or disproves facts, not the other way around. If a theory, as he understands it, says facts cannot happen, then they never occurred. You are wrong. Simple as that. If academic theory says something, facts and evidence are irrelevant. People who argue on facts are "idiots". And if you call things "spillovers" or "economic side-effects" instead of "externalities", you're an idiot too." - Sylvain Galineau [http://www.chicagoboyz.net/mt/stnemmoctm.cgi?entry_id=1778]	 
		 
==Conservative Fuck, and also Bipolar Fuck==	 
[[Image:Chb.jpg|thumb|right|[[CHB]] exclusively knows the "truth"]]
* <I>"I believe that "the paleoliberals" whoever they may be, are redeemable. If I list them, however, that would make them very angry and I would probably not be able to reach those individuals."</i> - Hipocrite [http://www.andrewhagen.com/archives/2003/11/13/347/#comment-276]	 
* Worked endlessly to nuke Encyclopedia Dramatica from Wikipedia, but says: <I>You misunderstand the policy. I am not violating POINT by opposing what I think is indecent in a group that's there to oppose indeceny. You think naked people are indecent, I think censorship is. There is no "pun" and there is no "parody." Also, WP:NPA, especially in my userspace. Thanks. Hipocrite 20:21, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</I>". So, only likes to censor people that piss off his friends.
* "This is how I feel that I contribute best to this encyclopedia - by going to places where high-POV people are fighting, and trying to calm things down." Hipocrite 15:08, 22 August 2005 (UTC), lulz, also quite clueless.

==<S>Dead and Done</s>==
Having [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Hipocrite#User:Torinir_and_diffs run out of excuses for him incessant flaming], Hipocrite has decided to [[wikibreak|commit Wikisuicide]][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Hipocrite&oldid=67456097] and start anew.  This makes Hipocrite the second[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Hardvice] veteran casualty in the Great MONGO Wars.  So much for "thousands of good faith edits", eh bitch?

===Undead Hipocrite returns===
Apparently, the fucker refuses to stay dead, and has returned to "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=500&target=Hipocrite rv vandalise]" a variety of [[shit]] articles on Wikipedia on August 11th, 2006. When contacted for comment, he said to try again later as he was busy molesting small animals and children.

==TruthInMedia==	 
He apparently sometimes goes by this alias as well, if you'd like to say hi! He has a [http://www.truthinmedia.org website], too.
* "Hipocrite/TruthInMedia, Could you please decide on one alias to use on this blog? If you want to stay with Hipocrite, than I will edit your previous posts to that alias."[http://www.mattmargolis.com/blog/archives/2003/08/07/think-ill-buy-me-a-football-team/]
For the Fucking Lulz

==PouponOnToast==
Hipocrite's current sock, PouponOnToast, has taken it upon himself to be a one-man army in defense of [[Gary Weiss]] long after all of [[WordBomb]]'s allegations of Gary socking were proven true.  Whether PouponOnToast is trolling to make Gary look even worse or simply trolling for trolling's sake is unclear.
