On [[post ending in (x)|Saturday December 29th, 2007]], [[B|/b/tards]] were awoken by an angry rumbling sound from above. As they rubbed the sleep from their [[fap|masturbation damaged eyes]], they realized that it wasn't an angry God per se, but an angry [[m00t|landlord]].

[[m00t]] had finally realized that [[The Cancer|all was not well]] in [[the House of 4chan]] and specifically, there was a problem in the [[B|/b/asement]] that was driving down his property values and threatening the very foundations of his crib. That problem? [[newfags|Vermin]], in particular, the [[WHEN I WAS|Faggotry Termite]].

m00t immediately posted a [[sticky]] to the effect that [[newfags|anyone]] posting "[[post ending in (x)]]" posts would be banned. Likewise [[buttsecks|gay porn]] dumpers and [[camwhores]].

To [[oldfag|many]], this was a welcome and long overdue measure, to others, it was an [[Shocked & Appalled|"OMGZ!!one RULES ON MY /b/!one!!]]". And then were are those who saw delicious [[troll]]age in the offing and set out to bait the newly empowered 4chan [[mods]]. Howevar, like the idiots they are, these wannabe trolls just got beat down like it was a game of [[fursecution|Whack-A-Mole]] when they started popping up.

Healthy ([[13-year-old boy|and not so healthy]]) debate raged throughout the weekend but one thing became all too clear: [[Oldfags]] had had enough! Praises were lavished upon m00t and the mod squad and they were hailed as gods. Meanwhile, butthurt whiners (who are nevar happy), [[Incontinent Student Bodies|BAAAAAAWED]] about the 'freedom of speech', the implications of rules on [[B|/b/]] and "OMG CENSORSHIP!!!"
[[Image:The oldest meme.png|thumb|350px|'''"/b/ was never good"''' is a [[meme]] as old as 4chan itself. Howevar, 4chan [[mods|scientists]] recently [[b&|bitch-slapped the taste out]] of a [[newfag|Prove Me Wrong]]fag's mouth, proving him [[RONG]]!]]


But it was too late...oldfags remembered the old days, <strike>"[[old meme|when /b/ was good]]"</strike> (/b/ was never good) and they began to pine and long for the return of the legendary [[W.T. Snacks]] -he of the hasty banhammer. Before long, the cries went out to "'''BRING BACK SNACKS!'''"

==Where It All Began==

==Later That Day==
[[Image:Around_snacks.jpg|thumb]]
Shortly thereafter, an open letter to [[m00t]] appeared on [[B|/b/]] from [[butthurt|concerned]] Oldfags, congratulating him (and the mods) for his bans, but went on to suggest that since /b/ was still infested with [[newfags|vermin]] virtually [[sage|replacing]] any [[Original Content]] (requiring thought and time to create [[lulzy]] [[shoops]]) with the sheer force of  volume, [[Post ending in (x)|post ending in ban]] wasn't enough to stop [[The Cancer|"the rot"]].

With this, drastic measures were called for since a tsunami of [[unfunny]], [[boring]] and [[MS Paint|uninspired]] newfag bollocks  was drowning out the 10 active pages of [[B|/b/]] and killing [[original content]] as the vermin needs no time to reproduce [[The Cancer|shitposts]]; just repost the same crappy pictures from their [[B|/b/]] folder everyone's seen (literally >9000 times) and [[cuntpaste]] some banal shit like [[CONFIRMED FOR BRAWL]]

No, [[the infestation that is lowering m00t's property value]] needed [[kill it with fire|extermination]] by a professional [[banhammer|pest control]] expert; that expert?...[[W. T. Snacks]] (Lord of the Hasty Banhammer).

==Interim Measures:The [[Oldfag Sage Collective]]==
[[Image:Saged by the osc.png|frame|Remember, [[sage]] goes in the email field!]]

As the furor died down, Oldfags revitalized by the whining of newfags and [[Viagra|invigorated]] by the memory of a /b/ that nevar was set about putting their house in order. The infestation of faggotry was put under the microscope and identified, lists were made and off went the Oldfags in a frenzy, armed only with [[sage]] bombs.

From this day forth, such [[unfunny]], boring, uninspired, rote 'lazy' threads such as [[You Laugh, You Lose]], [[Everyone Get In Here]], [[Confirmed For Brawl]], [[Roll Call]] and [[This is my /b/ face|This was my face when I saw (x)]] were to be [[kill it with fire|killed with sage]]. Even the relatively lulzy [[Motivate Me /b/]] requests went unfilled, the threads ruined by [[B|/b/tards]] responding not with [[Demotivators]] but with witty retorts such as "You're dying."

==Project BRING BACK SNACKS==

Project BRING BACK SNACKS is a recently created project with the main objective of reviving the old, less shitty /b/.

It is currently in effect as of 12/31/08.
