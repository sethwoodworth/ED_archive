A '''"Bel-Air"''' is a [[4chan]] [[b|/b/]] [[copypasta]] [[meme]] for which [[Anonymous]] will start off with a story about some provocative subject (usually wincest with your [[16-year-old girl|little sister]]), and right around the climax of said story, interject with my mom got scared,
and said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air." I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it. Yo, holmes to Bel-Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo homes smell ya later!" Looked at my kingdom I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air.

Having engaged you in some compelling story of repressed, animal lust at the thought of banging your barely pubescent sister, you are abruptly treated to the lyrics from the [[Will Smith|Fresh Prince]]. A clever ruse indeed.

This is an anecdote explaining the manner in which my way of life was rotated along a Y axis until it reached a position roughly 180 degrees from that which it started. If I could have 60 seconds of your time, simply place your posterior in the selected location, and I will relate to you the details of how I was made the male monarch of the district of the City of Los Angeles, California located at coordinates 34.08333 -118.44778.

In the western region of the “City of Brotherly Love” known as [[Philadelphia]], my mother expelled me from her womb and indeed that is also where I spent my childhood, in my mother’s care. The majority of my time was spent in a recreational area containing such diversions as a jungle gym, swing set, sand box, etc. I was typically at the height of leisure while frequently at a temperature slightly below what might be considered standard room temperature. Outside of my educational institution I was engaging in a game of basketball with some of my peers, when two [[gentlemen]] who seemed to be of the disposition to cause a great deal of mischief began causing a great deal of chaos and disharmony in the area in which I lived. I was involved in one rather small bout of fisticuffs after which my mother became concerned for my general safety and well-being, and she informed me that I would be moving in with her sister and her sister’s husband in the previously mentioned community located at the previously mentioned location.

I implored my mother to relent approximately 24-48 hours ago, yet she gathered my belongings in a somewhat flat, rectangular shaped piece of luggage and expelled me from her presence. She placed her lips upon my cheek in an affectionate manner and handed me a pre-purchased pass for public transportation. I placed the headphones for my personal music system into my ears and verbalized the idea that I may as well impact this situation with my foot. Traveling in the highest available level of comfort, this is indeed an unfortunate situation (although I make this statement with some irony). Consuming the juices obtained by the squeezing of the fruit of a Citrus sinensis from a piece of glass stemware commonly reserved for the sipping of [[Sparkling Wiggles|sparkling]] wine originating from the Champagne region of France, I pause to wonder if this is indeed how the residents of the admittedly upper-class neighborhood located at the previously mentioned location commonly live. Indeed, I find this situation may be rather to my enjoyment.

I puckered my lips and exhaled forcefully to produce a shrill note in order to gain the attention of a taxicab driver, and as the driver approached I observed his California vanity plate which, in place of the traditional jumble of alpha-numeric characters, used only the letters F, R, E, S, and H, spelling out the word “fresh”. Additionally, from his rear view mirror dangled a pair of oversized, fur-covered cubes decorated to look like the six-sided dice commonly used in gambling and board games. In such a situation I could have made a statement about the unusualness of this particular taxicab to the point of it being nearly unique. Instead I cogitatively decided against it and instead informed the driver that he should deliver me to what was to become my new home in the community located at the previously mentioned location.

We pulled up to a large domicile sometime between the hours of 7 and 8 o’clock a.m., and in a loud tone of voice I informed the cab driver that at some undetermined point in the future I would again detect his odour through my sense of olfaction. I gazed about the region of land that I was destined to rule, reflecting on my arrival: Here I would claim my rightful place upon the throne, from which I would govern the previously mentioned community of Bel-Air as monarch.

Now, this is a story all about how<br>
My life got flipped-turned upside down<br>
And I'd like to take a minute<br>
Just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised<br>
On the playground was where I spent most of my days<br>
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school<br>
When a couple of guys<br>
Who were up to no good<br>
Startin making trouble in my neighborhood<br>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
And said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br>
But she packed my suitcase and send me on my way<br>
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.<br>
I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad<br>
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.<br>
Is this what the people of Bel-Air Living like?<br>
Hmmmmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear there're prissy, bourgeois and all that<br>
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?<br>
I don't think so<br>
I'll see when I get there<br>
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out<br>
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out<br>
I ain't trying to get arrested yet<br>
I just got here<br>
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror<br>
If anything I can say that this cab was rare<br>
But I thought 'Nah forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'<br>
I looked at my kingdom<br>
I was finally there<br>
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

==riA-leB==
In Bel-Air, California, born and raised<br>
At the country club is where I spent most of my days.<br>
Having a lark, relaxing all day<br>
Driving some balls right down the fairway

When a band of ruffians, believing they had impunity<br>
Started making trouble in my community<br>
I got in one mere tussle and it gave my mom the willies,<br>
She said "You're moving to your aunt and your uncle in West Philly."

I hired a limo, and as it drew near<br>
The license plate said "DAPPER" and it had dice in the mirror.<br>
I could only deduce that this limousine was quite frilly,<br>
But I paid it no mind and directed the driver, "To West Philly!"

I arrived at the house at 7:34<br>
And gave a generous tip to my kindly chauffeur<br>
Looked upon my new residence, the weather was chilly<br>
But I knew that I was now the Dapper Lad of West Philly

==Laptop Rager's Bel-Air==
Now, this is a story all about how<br>
Our lives got flipped-turned upside down<br>
And I liked to take a minute<br>
Just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you how we became the ragers of a forum called CB

In west Gaia born and raised<br>
On the internet was where we spent most of our days<br>
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
And all trollin some noobs outside of the forums<br>
When a couple of guys<br>
Who were up to no good<br>
Started making trouble in our neighborhood<br>
We got in one little fight and Lanzer got scared<br>
He said 'You're movin' with your kind in the CB'

We begged and pleaded with him day after day<br>
But he packed our inventory's and send us on our way<br>
He gave us a kiss and then he gave us our ticket.<br>
We put our ZONY Discman on and said, 'We might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad<br>
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.<br>
Is this what the people of CB living like?<br>
Hmmmmm this might be alright.

But wait we hear they're pissy, bitches all that<br>
Is CB the type of place they send these ragein cats?<br>
We don't think so<br>
We'll see when we get there<br>
We hope they're prepared for the ragers of CB

Well, the plane landed and when we came out<br>
There was a dude who looked like a mod standing there with our names out<br>
We ain't trying to get banned<br>
We just got here<br>
We sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

We whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
The license plate said 'STFU' and it had [[animu]] in the mirror<br>
If anything we can say this cab is rare<br>
But we thought 'Now forget it' - 'Yo homes to CB'

We pulled up to the forums about 9 or 10<br>
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes GTFO'<br>
We looked at our kingdom<br>
We were finally there<br>
To settle our throne as the Rager's of CB

==[[Maple Story]]==
Now, this is a story all about how<br>
My life got flipped to 2D<br>
And I'd like to take a minute<br>
Just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you about the fagland, straight from me.

In west Amherst born and raised<br>
Maple Island I spent most of my days<br>
Jumping out attacking relaxing all cool<br>
Shooting some snails outside of school<br>
When a couple of sins<br>
Who were up to no good<br>
Startin making KS'in in my neighborhood<br>
I got in one little fight and my family tree got scared<br>
They said 'Go get a job advancement.'

I begged mesos day after day<br>
But she lost [[The Game]]<br>
She gave NX and sent me on my way.<br>
I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it, except I can't since I'm a beginner.'.

No class, yo this is bad<br>
Drinking orange potion out of a champagne glass.<br>
Is this what the people of Henesys Living like?<br>
Hmmmmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear there're furfags, KSers and that<br>
Is this the type of place that they should send this noob?<br>
I think so<br>
I'll see when I get there<br>
I hope they're prepared for the Noblesse of Henesys

Well, the plane landed and when I came out<br>
There was a dude who looked like a GM standing there with my name out<br>
I ain't trying to get ban yet<br>
I just got here<br>
I sprang with the quickness like the noob haste, disappeared

I whistled for a cab but it didn't come near<br>
The license plate said "Beginners get 90% off" and it had dice in the mirror<br>
If anything I can say that this cab was an NPC<br>
But I thought 'Nah screw it' - 'Yo to Henny'

I pulled up to FM at 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to the cabbie 'MESOS PLZ?!?!?!?!'<br>
I looked at my room<br>
I was finally there<br>
To sit on my ass as a Maplefag<br>

==Pedo-Air==
This is the story all about how<br>
my life got flip turned upside down<br>
So if you take a moment and sit right there<br>
I tell you how I became the meme called pedobear.

In west Neverland born and raised<br>
Stalking the playground is how I spent most of my days<br>
Checking out max relaxing all cool<br>
Playing with my balls outside of the school<br>
When a couple of kids who were looking real good<br>
Didn't check the offender registry in their neighborhood.<br>
I touched one little kid and her mom got scared and said, "I'm calling the fbi on you sick pedobears"

So I whistled for a van but when it came near<br>
the license plate said chan and there was a party in the rear<br>
If anything I could say this van was a snare<br>
But I thought, "Nah forget it, you can't catch a running bear"

I pulled out of the girl, who was seven or eight<br>
and I yelled to the moralfags, "''Yo homos, sage you later''"<br>
Looking at her crotch I got there before the hair<br>
She can sit on my bone cause I'm the pedobear.

==[[Yu-Gi-Oh]] [[Littlekuriboh|Bel-Air]]==
Now this is a story all about how<br>
my life got flipped; turned upside down;<br>
And I'd like to take a minute;<br>
just sit down, James;<br>
I'll tell you how I became the undisputed King of Card Games.

In northeastern Africa, born and raised;<br>
in the palace was where I spent most of my days<br>
chilling out max and relaxin' all the while,<br>
or playing some card games right beside the Nile.<br>
When a couple of guys who were up to no good,<br>
starting making trouble in my neighborhood!<br>
I got in one little fight and the gods got scared;<br>
they said "''You're moving in with Yugi and his Grandpa downstairs!''"

I wound up in Japan and things were less clear;<br>
like I couldn't kill folks for losing card games here!<br>
If anything, I could say that this place is lame;<br>
but I thought, "''Nah forget it I'll play some card games!''"

I bought card game booster packs, seven or eight;<br>
and I yelled at the old man "Yo, Homes, smell ya later!"<br>
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there<br>
to sit on my throne with my ridiculous hair!

==Rape-Air==
[http://curezone.com/forums/fm.asp?i=1505325#i I am a 28 year old male, whom is still girlfriend free, if you ladies are interested. Throughout my whole life, I was bullied and teased for my weight and my strange demeanor. In my quest for a boyfriend-free girl, it appears to be futile in that even when I was advertising myself as a caring, nice man, women flocked to the more masculine types. Sorry, I got carried away, I'm just in an emotional dilemma, for I was raped by not just one black man, but seven. Yes, seven, seven of which raped me with much bestial fervor. I was in west Philadelphia at the time, at my childhood playground, playing a game of auto-basketball by myself as I usually would every Sunday. Night was coming, and I practiced frivolously to improve my basketball prowess. As I made my last free throw shot, several of those hooligans entered the court; I was not aware of the events that would proceed. They said to me, if I can recall it accurately, "YO WHITE BOY, YOU GONNA GET RAPED!!!!" I was startled, yet steadfast. I had rights to this public domain, and no African American was going to keep me from exercising that right!!!! However, I would find that my rights were not the only things violated, but also my body; my forbearance was my demise. I would not appease to the minorities demands, and, as if time stood still, the buckle holding my suspenders was unhooked. I buffered to the door, simultaneously calling for help, but only to be replied with a miserly old woman's heckling. Why was I chosen by fate, no, by God to be the victim of such a crime? I looked into her callous eyes, which taunted me. Suddenly, four words escaped from her lips, "You gonna get raped..." The shadow she casts bore remarkable similarities to the devil, then I looked at the reflection in her spectacles. I saw the sweat running down my face, my bloodshot eyes filled with tears, the seven beast subjugating me, my fate. My cries of help were only meant with the heckling of that wretched geezer, who's visage resembles that of Madea, and the breathing of the seven. They took off my suspenders, tore through my limited edition Capt. Kirk replica uniform, and bounded me with rope. They raped me and my dignity that day, and I'll never forget the heckling of that wretched witch and those barbarians.]
