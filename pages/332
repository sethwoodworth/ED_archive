'''Alcoholics Anonymous''' is a pathetic club for [[niggers|people]] who want to show up to work drunk, and claim they have a [[Internet Disease|disease]] because God doesn't love them. You may be ordered by a judge to go to the AA, if you [[stfu|beat your wife]] or [[golden shower|piss on his lawn]].

If you said that you'd try it, not only are you a [[fucktard]], but you are a suitable candidate for Alcoholics Anonymous, a program that works exactly as well as the hypothetical "medicine" above.

Alcoholics Anonymous is an international [[cult|fellowship]] of [[men]] and [[women]] who have consumed so much [[alcohol]] that they have caused severe [[butthurt]] to everyone they know, are related to, or have ever been near to, including [[you|themselves]]. Desperate for a solution that allows them to believe that it is not all their own fault, they buy the bullsit that  drinking booze is a  disease,  they formed a group where they sit around in rooms talking, drinking coffee, and acting extremely self-righteous about all the truly fucked up things they have done. 

Many fall of the wagon, slip again and resume drinking, after all what can you expect from a guy with a wooden leg, i am  diseased is their plea.   Not wanting to assume respnsiblity for their lives, they call up  sponsors with cries  to rescue them ,  they like play a game to see if you can  make me quit all the while defeating anothers  best efforts. They create chaos and then say oh why  does this always happen to me.
 
In AA there is no "don't bite the newcomers" rule, so the [[oldfags]], who are usually disturbingly old  but love the 13th step and  the underage tweenies both boys and girls , haze the new guys and hit on the new women desperately trying  to get laid , whether they are [[skank]]s, [[skeezer]]s, or [[NORP]]'s.

==What is A.A?==
In 1934, [[OH BILL|Bill Wilson]] ran out of beer money. He claimed to be a [[Christian]] at the end of his rope, but was really a [[JEW]], because he figured out a way to get [[wiggers|loser drunks]] how to give him money for nothing. He wrote a fucking [[tl;dr|book]] telling people they were worthless until they learned that God wanted them to do Bill's bidding. He is considered the most original trolls of the 21st Century.

Once people figured out God wasn't real, and people figured they'd find another way to fix their problems, Bill Jew-haggled his way into the courts so that if you got [[party van|caught]] being  [[fucktard|drunk in public]], you'd have to go to an AA meeting.

Some professionals refer to alcoholism and drug addiction as “substance abuse” or “chemical dependency.” We prefer to call it "[[lulz]]". Nonalcoholics are, therefore, sometimes introduced to A.A. and encouraged to attend A.A. meetings - making it surprisingly easy to pick up anything (or anyone, they're all drunk) you want. [[Hookers and blow]] are kept on ice for emergency party situations. Anyone may attend open A.A. meetings, but only those who really like to get down and drink hard may attend closed meetings.

===Is Alcoholics Anonymous a Cult===

duh I think so 

===Alcoholics Anonymous a Cult===

duh I think so

===Alcholics Anonymous is  a cult===

you betcha

==What Does A.A. Do?==
A.A. claims that it helps people with the [[KFC|original]] [[bullshit|12-Step Program]], and turns drunken assholes into productive members of society. This, of course, is a [[lie|total fucking lie]].

Oddly, A.A. members often insist that A.A. is not a [[religion]] despite the fact that five of the twelve steps mention [[God]]. [http://www.serenityfound.org/steps.html The Twelve Steps.] This seemingly [[Bullshit|bizarre]] idea is justified by claiming that anything qualifies as a "Higher Power," even doorknobs; the A.A. member is encouraged to seek his or her own conception of God. The argument goes something like this:

# Drink your face off.
# [[Fail|Fuck up your life totally]].
# Go to A.A. where you are told that it is not your fault because you can't control it. [[Lie|Only God can]].
# Become STRAIGHT EDGE
# [[????]]
# [[Profit|PROFIT]]
# Get Laid shag a newcomer
=== Bill  Wilson Does Drugs and SEES God For REAL !!!! ===

Whether you like it or not Bill Wilson, founder of AA, found  his higher power on drugs. The Bella Donna Cure used those deadly nightshade plants ,  they get you high,  they poison you so much that you end up in a state where you have one foot in the grave and one foot in the land of the living. You hallucinate your brains out. Dosage is critical. Overdoses are fatal. Bill's preparation for his visionary experience was nothing but years of guzzling cheap rotgut whiskey and bathtub gin. 

Bill's visions or hallucinations were also  caused by or enhanced by delirium tremens, which is infamous for making people see pink elephants or zillions of crawling bugs.

"In the end, after all of the drinking, drugging and debauchery, Wilson remained an irresolute drunk, always seeking that next big fix. Whether it was from occult religion, womanizing or his other drug addictions concerning nicotine and acid, he never looked within to liberate himself from his vices. He literally believed he was powerless over everything! But, dammit, he never drank again so the true believers can overlook all of those other details. "

<blockquote>The following involves LOTS of drugs, drunkenness and debauchery.
This page is NOT for the "powerless"...unless you want to get your H.P. on like Wilson did.
You have the power to choose to use or not to use.
Don't blame me when you decide to tie one on after reading this page.

===Serenity Slayers===

Found in every AA meetin, an AA Big Book thumper,  suffers high emotional reactivity along  with a stong need to control those around him. Extremely  hyper sensitive to those who question the  AA cult doctrine and draw attention to its inconsistencies, fabrications and deceit.   Totally indoctrinated himself, he  faces extreme anxiety when the AA house of cards bullshit is brought into question.  Engages in all manners of  childish temper tantrums such as stomping out of a meeting when the heretic speaks, will yell , name call, attempt to isolate the heretic from others and even succumbs to fits of rage where he will launch into physical attacks upon the heretic to prevent the light of day  from shining in on his program. Can often be seen with other Slayers giving the "I have been conned" heretic the bums rush out the door.

==The I have been Conned==

Many who enter this program realize they have been conned.  I mean really conned.  They thought this program was about alcohol problems only to find they fallen for a bait and switch.  They have found themselves in a cult.  A religious cult where a rock or door knob can be their higher power. Those who question the program are given the  suggestion to go out and do more research which means to drink some more,  many have taken this suggestion to mean hit the internet and upon doing so found out how  they were conned. 

Others came to realize they were conned and in a cult upon  watching the South Park Bloody Mary Episode, and yet others only came to this realization  after viewing  Penn and Teller's AA is Bullshit episode.

Some of disenchanted now have taken up residence on such websites as Stinkin Thinkin dot com  where they post their stories of abuse, terror, and the predators in the roomzzz.  Another reliable  Reference source the aholes on the Wikipedia delete right here !! http://stinkin-thinkin.com/.

Many of conned  spend their time reading the Orange Papers Org. especially the letters where the conned email their grievances and get their Dear Abby response.   Others have joined in campfires where they engage in  big book burnings and story sharing of  how they got conned.
Another reliable reference source that the aholes on Wikipedia will never never ever ever allow right here !!   http://www.orange-papers.org/


===The  Really Pissed Off I have been  Conned===


These are people who have spent years in the 12 step program before realizing they had been conned.  Totally  pee-oooooed for wasting time and energy in  attending meetings, tired on the hearing  endless  drunkalogues and bored with the constant barrage of slogans, it is  these individuals  that are more than likely to become activists.   You will find them at Church Halls as well as other AA meeting sites painting graffitti on the walls , passing out anti AA  literature , and givng out internet  directions to the famous Orange Papers.  Their motto is "I won't get conned again". At times  you will see one or more of them being assaulted by an enraged Serenity Slayer. 


This is serious stuff and their mission statement, a  paroday of the AA premable, is all about being conned and that they won't get conned again.  

RARELY HAVE they seen a person who has thoroughly followed their path.Those who do recover are usually people who have recognized AA as a dangerous religious cult, and will not give themselves completely to AA’s fanatical program.The AA Cult is constituted primarily of men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with anyone… including themselves.
Some of them are not at fault; They were screwed the second they set foot into the church basement door. They were systematically indoctrinated into believing that alcoholics are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands any type of honesty. They should still be held accountable for the behavior that has ruined so many lives. Many AA members suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders. The program requires that they believe alcoholics can never recover. Most of the people who quit drinking without AA have recovered in large part, due to their self-determination and ability to act rationally. Our stories disclose in a general way what We used to be like, what happened, and what We are like now.
If You have decided You want to leave Alcoholics Anonymous and are willing to go any lengths to do it – then You are ready to take certain steps.
At some of these We were delighted. We were sure that We had found a more sound and reasonable way. With all of the earnestness at our command, We encourage You to be resolute and confident from the very start. Some of Us have tried to hold on to Our old AA ideas and the result was nil until We let go absolutely. Remember that WE deal with Alcoholics Anonymous – cunning, baffling, dishonest! Continuing the mental masturbation was too much for Us.
There is only one person who has the power to overcome your alcohol problem – that person is You. May You trust and believe in Yourself now! Delusions and superstitious nonsense availed Us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We learned to protect and care for Ourselves with complete Self-acceptance. Here are the steps We took which are encouraged as a course of action to escape the AA mind trap… 

We decided We were “Not Powerless” over alcohol – that Our lives had become dominated by AA.
Came to understand that We were never as morally reprehensible as some AA members had led Us to believe.
Made a decision to turn and walk away from Alcoholics Anonymous forever.
Made a scorching and fearless indictment against AA as an organization.
Admitted to Ourselves and another Human Being that We had been ambushed into joining a religious cult.
Were entirely ready to relieve Ourselves of the self-defeating bullshit We were taught at AA.
Familiarized Ourselves with cult indoctrination tactics in order that We may never fall into a similar trap again.
Made a list of all AA-members who had harmed Us, and became willing to confront them all.
Called such people on their bullshit whenever possible, except when to do so would significantly injure them or others.
Continued to indict Alcoholics anonymous and when We were wronged promptly expressed our disapproval of it.
Sought scientific empirical evidence that could help Us to defeat addiction; focusing on Ourselves as the Power to carry that out.
Having been awakened from the AA nightmare as a result of these steps, We tried to carry this message to other victims of AA, so that everyone might know the truth about the Alcoholics Anonymous cult. 

You are not alone.
Many of Us have been misled by the religion that claims not to be a religion. Some of Us suffered for years oblivious to the fact that AA offers no reliable or even sincere method to help alcohol troubled people to recover from addiction. When We felt hopeless… They used it against Us. They told us We were powerless.
They did it to break Us down.
They did it to make Us unsure of Ourselves.
They did it to recruit new members for their religious cult.
We’re here to expose AA for what it really is. If You’ve tried AA over and over again, and You’re not getting the results you were promised, maybe it’s time You tried something else.
Think about it.

==How to troll Alcoholics [[Anonymous]]==
*Bring a flask
*Take drink orders
*One-up every 'rock bottom' story
*Remind them how much fun they used to have when they got trashed
*Use only liquor-related nicknames (Jack Daniels, Jim Beam, Johnny Walker, Tina Tequila)
*Repeatedly ask what atheists are supposed to do about step 2
*Insist on last names
*Tell them the whole meeting feels 'a little cult-like'
*"[[Accidentally]]" break the coffee machine
*Mention that the disease/powerlessness concept is flawed and merely an excuse to avoid taking personal responsibility for having hurt others.  Accuse them of believing what they believe because it makes them feel better, not because it's the truth.
*Insist that the 9th Step (making amends) is born out of a desire for self preservation rather than sincere regret.
*Mention that your higher power, Jesus Christ, believes humans have free will and drinking is a sin and a choice.  When they suggest you choose a different higher power, insist they are in the grasp of Satan as they are contradicting the word of God ([http://www.2ndccn.com/Twelve_Steps_to_Hell.html do your research on this]).
*Tell them that your higher power is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus Dionysus, god of wine] (Or similar.  Satan will suffice in a pinch).  When they insist you change higher powers, accuse them of religious intolerance.
*Remind them that all the cigarettes and coffee they consume will kill them just as fast as booze
*Tell them that you drink occasionally but are not an alcoholic.  Say a relative has insisted you go to an AA meeting and you're just doing it to satisfy them.  Watch as they accuse you of being in denial.  Mention denial in AA as being a Catch 22 similar to dunking a witch (the more you deny it, the more it's evident you are an alcoholic).
*Try to get a straight answer as to why a higher power is required to quit drinking.
*Amateur stand-up routines when it's your turn at the mic
*Cough "Step 13" at every woman in the meeting
*Ask if there are alternatives to AA (or insist there are and [http://rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/ToolsResources/Resources.asp#Mutual list them]).
*Show up piss-ass drunk.
