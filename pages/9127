[[At least 100 years ago|For centuries]], [[Wimmins|womyn]] everywhere have suffered the injustice of living in a [[Nazi|fascist]] patriarchy intent on keeping them as [[BDSM|slaves]] to [[A_Womyn's_Guide_to_Males|men]]. This travesty to liberty was only accelerated when womyn everywhere were burdened with suffrage. Since 1920, [[Feminism|feminist]]s everywhere have worked in the hard to end the forced burden of suffrage from female US citizens. Alas, the patriarchy refuses to hear their pleas and womyn are still chained to suffrage.

The road of action is clear. Please [http://www.house.gov/writerep/ contact your representatives] and [http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm senators] and tell them that you will no longer tolerate women's suffrage! In 2008 [[Hillary Clinton]] plans to run for President on an anti-suffrage campaign. Everyone go out and change the world with their vote! FREEDOM FOR WOMYN! DEATH TO THE PATRIARCHY!

Thanks to womyn's sufferage, [[chick]]s now must be called [[chick|chycks]].

==Women's Suffrage Activists==
Most Women's sufferage activists are [[lesbian|lesbians]] and closet [[FTM]]s who wish that they had the power of the penis which men wield daily to control the world and most important the shiny metals that reside within the world. These [[womyn|womyn]] are rather ugly and have been known from time to time to never shave their armpits nor bath. They cry about their pathetic lives and the blood that streams from their gashes just about 12 times a year, but for all their complaining have yet to make anyone a sandwich.
