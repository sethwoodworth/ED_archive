A '''redneck''', also known as a '''hillbilly''' is a [[guns|heavily armed]] [[conservative]] [[white]] [[Gentlemen|gentleman]], from the Southern and Midwestern part of [[America]], known as the Bible Belt. They are also the [[Jews|scum of the Earth]]. They are so prevalent that most outsiders think that this is what all Americans are like, much like how many Americans think all Brits are members of the upper class. When subjected to the company of a [[mundane|normal]] human being, i.e. anyone who can read, or a [[black]] person, they become highly agitated, and [[domestic violence|beat their wives]]. Their society is [[poor|illiterate]], and their main cultural activities include [[meth|finding creative uses for their bathtubs]], [[obesity|improving their figures]] through [[alcohol|drinking]], and [[racism|providing insightful viewpoints on the role of diversity in America today]]. Wannabe rednecks are the worst. Merely coming in contact with one [[IRL]] can turn you homosexual and having an irresistible urge to display the [[confederate]] flag on anything you see.

Oddly, most [[furries]] are rednecks (and vice versa). This is odd because rednecks are notoriously homophobic, despite being [[not gay]].

You can learn more about rednecks from watching the movie "Deliverance."

==Redneck Sports==

Rednecks watch sports frequently, but never actually play any sports, as this would ruin the ideal redneck body type. Their sports of choice include drinking, [[NASCAR]], drinking, and [[incest]]. Rednecks play American football, which is similar to [[Europe]]an rugby, except that it is played by [[negro|gorillas]] and [[retards]]. Perhaps the most popular activity among Rednecks are [[drugs|Oxycontin eating contests]]. Rednecks also enjoy creative alternative sports, as seen here [http://www.crimelibrary.com/news/original/0706/2603_i65_sniper_myspace.html]

==Rednecks and motor sports==

Unlike most northerners whom are raised around normal things such as football, baseball, hockey, basketball, etc. Hillbillies grow up watching NASCAR, dirt bike racing, NHRA drag racing, tractor pulls, monster trucks, boat racing, and any kind of sporting event which involves some type of motorized vehicle. Their cultural fascination with motor sports is believed to be because most of them were born in the back seats of automobiles, or in the beds of pickup trucks, to unwed, teenage mothers whom were taking Oxycontin and Xanax during their pregnancy. With their fathers actually being their cousins, and often distantly related to some vague NASCAR driver or some other auto-racing "athlete."

Update: It has been recently discovered that the reason they watch motorized sports is because most of them are fat, and see motorized sports as a way to be an athlete without actually exercising.

"J'ever done gone'n getted that thar thang you was gonna git from the catalog?"

Loosely translated, this means "Did you receive the item which you ordered from the catalog?" A catalog is a form of [[old media]]. It is similar to [[eBay]], but printed on paper and sent to everybody's house through the mail, another form of old media. Also, a catalog does not have the possibility of a bidding war where the price of an item escalated to [[over 9000]] times its actual value and could be bought by nobody. They also treat the word "done" as a modal verb, putting it in front of every conjugation, ex. "I done did good". They also use "y'all" (you all) in every sentence.

==Redneck Mating==

''Main article: [[Incest|Redneck Mating]].

Since many rednecks come from small country towns in the US, there is a limited pool of eligible people to [[secks|mate]] with. Many rednecks thus marry their [[incest|sibling or their cousin]]. This results in more retarded children, who grow up to be rednecks and do likewise.  There seems to be no way to break this vicious cycle.  This population expansion in the redneck communities results in the [[Republican]]s winning elections.

Also note that redneck men only like redneck girls and will shit bricks if their girlfriend has a mind. She belongs in the kitchen, damnit. This usually leads to them being attracted to buck-toothed ugly shits who will get on their knees whenever Papa tells her to.


== How do I know if I'm a redneck? ==

Don't worry, the fact that you are able to access the Internet means that you are most likely not a redneck. Also, in order to be a redneck, you must first possess several of the following items:

*A rusty wheelbarrow 
*A pickup truck.
*A "[[Dixie]]" horn.
*A banjo
*4 foot tall CB whip antenna on your truck, during and after hunting season.
*Miscellaneous car parts in your overgrown yard.
*At least one car on cinder blocks.
*A tractor, especially if you don't live on a farm.
*A beagle or collection of miscellaneous dogs underneath your trailer.
*A collection of Elvis 45's.
*A Lynyrd Skynyrd shirt.
*A hatred of black person, Jew, [[azn|orientals]] and [[Islam|towelheads]] because they keep bringing the white man down.
*A flannel shirt.
*A "The South Shall Rise Again" bumper sticker and/or a confederate flag vinyl sticker covering your back windows on the above mentioned truck.
*A turkey fryer.
*Six toes, due to rampant inbreeding.
*If you understand what the hell Larry the cable guy is actually saying. Extra points if you actually find him funny.
*If you associate the word [[fag]] with Jeff Gordon.
*An attraction to your sister.
*A shiny new car while your house looks like utter [[shit]].
*At least one Git-R-Done t-shirt; bonus points if you cut the sleeves off.
*[[At least 100]] no trespassing/keep out signs nailed all over your bajillion acre land.
*Any sort of $7 obnoxious singing toy from [[Walmart]]
*[[Guns]].
*At least one country album and you actually listen to it. Bonus points if you have a bluegrass album.
*A [[fat|beer belly]]
*A [[Mullet]]

The gentleman below holds the standing record as the dumbest redneck that has ever existed. Note that he sympathizes with [[furries]], but hates [[Arabs]]:

== The Fascination with Hunting ==

Rednecks hunt in [[KKK|hunting clubs]] located in the middle of butt-fuck nowhere. This allows the typical redneck male increased freedom to engage in [[gay|group sex with other men]] at the clubhouse and out in the wild with the animals, much like [[furries]].  Most rednecks hunt for the imaginary shock value of this now [[old|outdated]] pastime. Some however must hunt for their food because the government has cruelly deprived them of their driver's licenses for driving [[drunk|creatively]], and the local Winn-Dixie just closed the meat department due to [[aids]].


== Redneck fetish == 
There has been a new fetish arising, and that is the redneck fetish.  One needs to be a seriously [[sick fuck|disturbed individual]] to have said fetish, and if you find this turns you on, you should seek [[an hero|immediate help]].
