{{work|pics and details}}

'''Justin.tv''' is a [[Web 2.0]] AIDS infested nest of failed [[college|Ivy League]] [[blogger]]s, needy [[camwhore]]s and a whole lot of [[faggotry]] created by this [[Azn]] named Justin Kan from [[San Francisco]][http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/03/30/MNG8OOUQI81.DTL]. The new term for being on webcam 24/7 is called '''"lifecasting" or "vlogging or vlogger a/k/a vlog"''' rather than the archaic "camwhore". 

The typical lifecaster protocol is to put up a donate link and then work some empathy into the [[you|end user]]. This causes the user to contribute their hard earned dollar thinking they have helped satisfy whatever need the fat slut is crying over at the time. Most of these sluts and faggots buy [[iPhone]]s with their donations even if they originally said it was to buy a new [[cripple|wheelchair]].

The sad thing is that this shit stain site hasn't gone the way of the dot-com bubble burst and basically die off, instead its celebrating a year of faggotry since the site is now over a yr old.

==The Beginning==

Originating as a project to observe an [[azn]] talk to people about the [[internets]], justin.tv evolved into a rudimentary [[MySpace]] complete with a live [[attention whore|webcam feed]] and IRC chat.

Anyone can now broadcast as [[retard|lifecasters]] and engage in a common form of internet panhandling: [[poor|begging for paypal donations]] to [[lie|"go mobile"]] (see: free [[iPhone]]).

Since open broadcasting is available to the entire [[internets]] public, several interesting events (aside from the trolls below) have occured, including but not limited to:
*A live [[Terri Schiavo]] broadcast
*A [[faggot]] 4-channer streaming as "AnonymousTV" with a bag over his head
*A couple having hardcore sex on cam
*A woman in her [[old|40s or 50s]] exposing her rather large breasts
*A 19 year old in Florida ODed and became [[an hero]]

==Raids==
[[Image:jtv-mudkipz.jpg|thumb|Giving in to /b/]]
As is standard procedure in such matters, /b/tards and others have trolled the broadcasters with the usual repertoire of internet [[meme|memes]], including but not limited to: [[put shoe on head]], [[mudkipz]], do a [[barrel roll]], etc. However, just like normal /b/ raids everyone gives up once they're banned after 15 seconds of hardcore super-meme terrorizing

Example of a /b/ raid on a justin.tv channel:

  <4chan1> DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU
  <4chan2> DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU
  <4chan3> MUDKIPZ LOL DESU DESU DESU DESU DESU
  niggertv sets mode +m on #niggertv

Sadly anyone who enjoyed trolling on JTV are locked down and banned quicker than it used to be. Though there are some who will entertain the shoe on head, show feet, boobs, show stomach, show ass, etc requests.

==IRL Trolling==

Going beyond the typical repetition of [[old meme|old memes]], some [[hackers]] and [[detective|internet detectives]] have used the site as a unique opportunity to troll people and then watch their live reactions.

'''Methods used so far:'''
*Using iprelay to have the local SWAT team raid their house.
*Caller ID spoofing between justin.tv users and using their handles when calling. When the lifecaster is asked to tell the chat what number is harassing them they inadvertently give out someone else's number.
*Hacking voice mailboxes.
*Installing keyloggers via recent browser vulnerabilities.
*Ordering lifecasters chinese food, pizzas, plumbers, locksmiths, strippers, singing telegrams, and much more.

'''Groups claiming responsibility'''
*[[B|/b/]]
*[[Anonymous]]
*[[Penis Pump]]
*[[bantown|trannytown]]

==VS WWE==
Hey everybody, lets goto justin.tv and watch illegal PPV streams, so of course the WWE SmackDowned the streams faster than Hulk Hogan can inject his steroids, brother!

"Springbreak JTV Style

*Awwww this is a piece I just love. One of my feel good JTV pieces. of the week. I loved watching their broadcasts and it brings a smile to my face instantly when I look as some of the pictures I snapped and when I watch some of the highlight clips.

*Five of some of the cutest & sweetest JTV broadcasters are spending part of their Spring Break in beautiful Orlando, Florida. Lex (LexFletcher), Nikki (Itsallcouture), Yvette (LadyMixTape), Arnaud (FromParis)and Dennis (Kioken). It was so much fun watching people meet for the first time -- especially JTV friends.

*There might still be time to catch a broadcast of the group. Check out their awesome special events channel designed by one of their wonderfully creative fans -- Maddie -- yes -- the same Maddie that does Dennis' awesome banners! Their next broadcast is scheduled for Saturday night March 22 @10PM on JTV United."

you too can go read the fail at http://justintvgossip.blogspot.com/

==The Moar you know==
As of 2/9/2008, Justin.tv has implemented DoD level defenses to ensure all the previous trolling is contained and restrained before it can happen. Some users do not care if you come into their room and troll or whatever but the ones now who are the camwhores and other attention getters snipe that shit real quick either by their kiss ass moderators or whine and bawww to the asian man himself.

*The new rules allow for keywords to be auto removal in user's room.
*Password protection for rooms so that certain camwhores can get their ego masturbated without needing to be bothered by other lower level members or persons.
*The room bans can be up to at least 24 hours, so if you decide to go and multi troll a few rooms then be prepared to spend 24 hours of not able to "shoe on head" etc.
*A lot of rooms now are auto muting or banning for any urls being posted "justin.tv/xxx or twogirlsonecup", and so forth.
*Be sure to make many sockpuppets so that in case one account goes dead or muted then you have to be ready to jump back to action.
*And the most important protip ever, if you make a broadcast page to mock someone (see Re-Tard vs E-Tard), note that some of those X channel defenders will become internet tough guys, bawwww and whine to the asian man to get Y spoofer Baleeted, send X channel defenders into Y spoof room to badmouth or insult, or it might just be epic fail with no lulz.

Now back to your scheduled programming.

==Special Section dedicated to C-um Stain, oops I mean E-Tard==

===http://e-tard.tv===
FAGGOTRY GOT BANHAMMERED

*Fag has his own special section on this page about this pile of e-shit.

*This guy is a real example of how American taxpayer dollars are wasted so this fucking pile of shit can be home all day with his daddy and play shitty music in the background, act like an internet lawyer when someone else decides to make a parody page of him and he goes bawwwwwwwwwwwing to JTV. Apparently he was able to con some girl to come visit him in January to go suck his small penis, her privated channel is http://www.justin.tv/rachel82.

*Update, this loser decided to go all internet lawyer on someone making a spoof page of him last night (2/17-2/18/08) claimed it was showing [[pedophile]]] porn etc, but in reality it was showing [[pedobear]], Chris Hansen tapes of "Catch a predator vol 4" and live streaming of e-turd and his manwhore rachel82. Apparently this freak has a profile at [http://vampirefreaks.e-tard.tv vampirefreaks], and likes to rave and was a former drug user, what a real fucking winner eh?

*This fag has his justin.tv cam streaming on over 9000 web pages that he fucking owns, even his faggy [http://vampirefreaks.e-tard.tv vampirefreaks] page has his god awful mug on there live. What a tool.

*Still no word if that fag likes to stick his e-penis in http://www.justin.tv/rachel82 e-vag, ha ha get it e-penis, e-vag, since e-tard is synonmyous with the usage of "e-*" anything.

*Hey guess what kids, apparently this cockfuck has decided to leave justin.tv but sadly his AIDS infested SSI living self still broadcasts on his other faggotry filled cam sites.

*RE-Tard moved to [http://www.ustream.tv/channel/e-tard ustream.tv] when will his mom take away his internet and tell him to get a job.

*RE-tard got raided by Canadians LOL http://forum.canucks.com/topic/252056-a-guy-who-streams-himself-247-on-the-internet

*Update Nov-22-2010 RE-Tard has left [http://www.ustream.tv/channel/e-tard ustream.tv] & now moved to [http://www.livestream.com/ETARD_The_LifeCaster_Live_on_WebCam livestream.com]

*Here are his other links [http://twitter.e-tard.tv Twitter], [http://myspace.e-tard.tv MySpace], [http://youtube.e-tard.tv YouTube].

* re-tards Google Phone # (650)-38E-TARD he has his name in the # what a loser.

===UPDATE FOR ALL YOU FAGS OUT THERE THAT CLING TO EVERY WORD I TYPE ABOUT THIS FAG, IM VERY IMPORTANT AND GET MY OWN ED SECTION===

from http://justintvgossip.blogspot.com/

Banning and canceled channels....

YES I THINK IM VERY IMPORTANT AND MADE MY OWN SECTION ON THIS PAGE. HAR HAR HAR. 

*E-Tard - okay I have never spoken about E-Tard -- but I FUCKING SO FUCKING BADLY need to now. (Wasn't getting enough page views) He is mean and nasty, I have no evolved past a First grade mentality yet, and do not belong on the internet. I have known this for sometime now -- because he banned me from his room once (See: [[Butthurt]] ) -- during a little pouting session where he wasn't casting because JTV made him put the 18+ filter on his room. He had a snarky little written response scrolling on his channel, almost as clever as me, but not close enough, for you see, I am god and the center of your world, I accept no imitations. The teacher in me was appalled at the MANY spelling errors (See: [[Grammar Nazi]] ). So my special JTV account had to make a visit to set him straight (How to get one of these accounts: Sign up like any other user) -- in a gentle way. He didn't like my kind suggestions and he banned me.Don't capitalize lol faggot. (See: Unwarranted Self importance Or [[Douchebaggery]] ) 

*Now since his banning from JTV he has taken to having friends of his (yes he does have at least one; More the me, sadly.) spam JTV with his USTREAM link.

*His latest strategy to win friends and influence people -- E-Tard has taken to verbally assaulting friends of mine in Skype, who all, like myself get very butthurt of the internets, because it's very serious business. Very cool, So cool I think ED is my personal blog. 

*Check this out. You might have to click on the pic to make it larger --- to see it, don't click it, I just want more views. If you don't want to do it -- I will tell you what you are missing. It is multiple posts from E-tard himself (lolol I got you now Etard.) spamming his USTREAM (Better Streaming service without midlife crisis oldfucks) channel in Phil's Help channel comment section. Why the fuck does this matter? Why am I acting like a High Schooler Bawwing about not getting asked to prom? 

*Recently a friend of mine got a 24 hour ban from JTV (This hurt me deeply)  for posting a phrase 10 times in a row. Be careful if you get overly excited one day and post the same link or phrase 10 times -- the great penis in the sky will get you! (Yes, I think this is very clever) 

Wahhh someone better break out the vagina tissues and tampons because someone got banhammered for posting a phrase x10, next time fag for x20 and be a winnar.

I know I am going to hell for even writing this article dedicated to this shit stain e-turd.

Hi my name is E-TARD
i was one of the top lifecaster on JTV
but the admins of JTV turned on me
and banned me because
i got sick of users jacking live TV like ESPN TNT WWE SHOWTIME & HBO etc…
doing that is illegal & also was killing the website
one CH showing espn would have like 9,000 viewers
there for killing the webste to the point where me & other members could not stay Live.
so i took things into my own hands & e-mailed espn wwe showtime & HBO telling them what was going on,
as i’m sure you know the owners of thoes TV CHs were not happy about it
JTV found out what i was doing & banned me
when i was banned from JTV i had somewhere around 600,000 peroifle hits
i started on JTV back when it was in the beta code days
but 4 weeks later they opend for anyone to join
& i was cool with that
just as long as ppl are not useing it to jack live TV
if you want to do then go out & download TVU

Your opinion doesn’t matter because you have never been in a sucessful tech company. There will be a second anniversary and you don’t know the laws concerning illegally streamed media online. Go read the Digital Millennium Copyright Act because you don’t know what you’re talking about. Justin.TV was at SXSW and the other networks (ustream and stickam) bearly had any viewers watching their extended coverage of SXSW. Justin.TV doesn’t need iJustine because she isn’t nobody and Ustream sucks. iJustine thinks that people are going to be supporting her ass for the rest of her life, she can’t even get a real job. You need to stay the fuck off of Justin.TV if you got some much shit to say about the site.

RE: txtballa, My friend you don’t know me well enough to make a blanket statement such as the one you’re making on my blog. But whatever man. Opinions are like assholes so you’ve definitely rise to that occasion again and again. I think your post has inspired me to dig deeper. Don’t come here coonin’, and stop dick riding that JTV rhetoric while you have some semblance of dignity left.

@E-TARD

Can’t you get it to your head that you are a rude and mean person. You have yelled at every admin and even tried to ban them. No, you are not a top broadcaster. You have banned almost everyone on JTV. Move on and stop whinning. And sorry to tell you, Apple, inc. will not get a hostile takeover.

Troyallen Says: 
26.03.08 at 1:00 pm 
Go away e-turd. The first time I came into your room, you were a SOB. I wanted to be nice and chat, but you banned my IP address, not a time-out, but a perm ban just for being in another room. I was new to JTV and didn’t know what was going on. You sir are a moron.

Gee Says: 
26.03.08 at 3:09 pm 
JTV for sure is not going to make it. I’ve posted bulletins of great channels on myspace and so far none of my friends have joined. Most of them are either on Stickam or ustream. Originally, Dealer’s channel was great when he started. Watching Dealer, iJustine, Roxie and justin was fun, but iJustine is gone, justin stopped broadcasting, Roxie hardly comes on and lately Alan couldn’t care less about his viewers. JTV is dead.

Son Of Sam Says: 
26.03.08 at 3:39 pm 
I liked Etard I even tried to talk to him on how to get his room off the content filter JTV dropped on him. He pleaded and promised that he’d adhere to the policies of JTV. Then he went straight back to his negativity. It’s no surprise they banned him but he’s no worst then the majority of channels currently on JTV.

anonymous Says: 
26.03.08 at 3:52 pm 
@ Son of Sam,

The main reason E-TARD got banned was because he was disrespectful to the people working at JTV. I have been in his room during the times he has called the JTV admins and even the staff vulgar names. He bothers them 24 hours a day. 7 days a week. They got fed up with him. And what business does he have to even complain about the sports channels? Let JTV deal with it. Does he own JTV? He’s whining because he loves to have people looking at his face while being banned from his room. His bandwidth is getting used up. So, why does he post is streaming video feed on 30 blogs? That uses bandwidth too. He’s a moron dictator.

ETARD is a cum stain. He banned my ip on ustream 30 minutes ago for asking why he wasn’t broadcasting today. He was yelling at me.

The moron E-TARD is still talking bad about JTV and his ban lists, while his boyfriends are fapping to his ugly face. He must be proud of himself

You talk crap about Apple as a joke E-TARD, but you are the real joke on the internet.

ETARD enjoys banning people. He’s now says, he’s going to break the JTV record of around 2,000 with a better script and laughs. The idiot needs to stop broadcasting.

from the tmz of justin.tv faggotry
http://justintvgossip.blogspot.com/

Awww it is so sad that I have to write about such a heartbreaking thing. :-( But Chucky of Obese Not Obsolete recently perished from the earth. I was told by a friend exactly a week ago but held off mentioning it until I found out for sure -- unfortunately it seems to be true. I started watching Chucky last summer. He was so kind to people and would honestly answer any question that people would ask him. He had a strong calling or a mission to educate while providing support to others who were obese. I wish he could have found help for himself. What I will remember most about him is his lovely warm smile, his hearty laugh, his conviction to making things better for others with his illnesses and the cool wall color in his bedroom.
In a lovely sign of sympathy and honor several of his JTV friends/fellow casters have changed their channel photo bar pictures to the above picture of Chucky to honor of his memory.

Chucky -- we miss you! Rest In Peace!

===DesignerGirl - Now This Is Funny===
I was away for most of the day yesterday but it seems that I missed some important Tweets about '''DesignerGirl'''. I am still gathering information. I have heard that she was in a car accident -- hit by a DUI driver - and was in a coma with some broken ribs. I have contacted one of her JTV friends and she said she will keep me posted. It would be nice if we could send her some cards or even call the hospital. I hope she gets better soon and returns to JTV, Twitter, and Epic Chat!

*Somebody call the wahhhhmbulance
*Commentary note, who the fuck would call the hospital and say "yeah man im a jtv addict checking up on designer girl and i wanted to ask her if shed show her feet, or put shoe on head or flash her tits, oh shes in a coma well then shes a cunt."

This bitch loves to whine and bitch on her jtv blog, why is she in here cause shes fucking one of the office slaves at jtv asian headquarters, and the fact this bitch could once walk, but God hated her so they slapped her down with a imaginary made up disease that has left this bitch in a wheelchair like christopher reeve. Oh points get added if you ask to see her nasty ass feet. Maybe she is legit wheelchair bound but I wonder if the boyfriend wants to dump her sorry ass cause he has to be the one who has to wipe the shit from her cunt everytime she goes to the toilet.

*news alert, seems some asskisser or white knight defender of this cripple bitch has been making the rounds of editing this entry out, hell it seems some justin.tv loser follower has been editing cara the cunt page too, so sad full of failure cause ill just keep reverting it back.

[[Image:AshleyMarieandAmberlive.jpg|thumb|Sisters AshleyMarie & Amber]].

Surprisingly Amberlive has a Sister. Sadly she won't be bringing any balance to the force either. This girl pretty much makes myspace graffix and does it for a living.

AshleyMarie used to be in [[Love]] with another caster [http://www.justin.tv/bobtv BOBTV].  They met via [[MySpace]].  They lived together.  Bob would leave his cam on so other geeks could watch him work at his websites. The couple would often take there laptops out while visiting restaurants and broadcast to the world. In December while decorating Ashleymarie & BobTV got into a fight live on cam, ashley did not want cam on, BobTV screamed at her and called her a stupid [[Cunt]]. The couple would appear on and off at JTV for the next few months.  On 15th April Ashleymarie appeared on cam with a new man in her life DAVE.  Bobtv was currently in [[San Francisco]] with [http://www.justin.tv/krystyltv KrystylTV], [http://www.justin.tv/jspin Jspin] & visiting [http://www.justin.tv/officecam THE JTV OFFICES]. DAVE Boasted that he had just had [[sex]] with Ashley in Bob's Bed. Bob was currently [[stalking]] Ashley in her chatroom.  Amberlive was enjoying turning the cam onto Ashley & Dave to make Bob jealous. BobTV would reply with comments about his new Girlfriend, rumoured to be KrystylTV.

*Those two are future porn actresses, or future whores working teh corner in pennshitsylvania.

Both Amber & Ashley both look like someone barfed makeup on them, and Ashleymarie's hair color is fucking atrocious. These two both have JTV layouts that look like they were crafted by flashtards and htmlwhores which include the following:
*fan wankery
*a/s/l tl;dr bullshit
*pictures that show what whores they are
*and other bullshit that you see on myspace, facebook and other gay sites.

Too bad noone gives a shit about these two, but sadly both girls have their ass kissing fans to defend them. Sadly some of these losers like to act all internet tough guys at the instant. Sadly like Amberlive, any lulz attempt or anything to remind ashley of how stupid her sister was by referencing this ED article results in her (sometimes amber comes on her cam page) to become silent and totally ignore. They seem to not acknowledge the past too if someone asks more than once (amberlive was quoted as once saying "I know nothing about that" when someone clearly posted her home address), nor acknowledge the lulz.

===[http://www.justin.tv/amberlive AmberLive]=== 

Playing the not-so-wholesome [[16-year-old_girl|16 year old internet slut]], she begged for money so that she could "go mobile" and shake her b-cup [[tits]] for 50 year old internet creeps. The trolls initially began calling her but soon pizzas, chinese food, and the fire department paid her and her mother a visit. During one cam session she was sitting out front on her porch when the pizza showed up and she started screaming, thinking it was her stalker, "WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR?". She makes occasional appearances on her whore sister ashleymarie's cam. Amberlive has started to broadcast on her cam, but any lulz attempts just end in fail cause of her internet toughguy friends or if you mention any lulz or this article she shuts up immediately and silence is all you hear. Just remember justin.tv now has clamped down on the lulz attempts and they have enacted ways to protect the camwhores like Amber from any lulz.

===[http://www.justin.tv/hgtv HonestGuy]===

A stoner bum [[Rob Levin|living on government disability welfare]] in his mother's garage while lifecasting. His main reason for lifecasting is faking his brother's illness and asking for donations while preaching the magical uses of medical marijuana. 

His first run in with trolls involved a user named pump4life claiming affiliation with the group [[Penis Pump]]. pump4life or commonly referred to as just "pump" managed to socially engineer his drug dealer friend into believing that Honestguy had lost his phone at a bus stop and wanted to call him to be able to return it. Like all chronic losers he fell for the [[trap|trapt]] and gave up his [[dox]].

After the first prank call spoofed as his friend's number he quickly called his friend back to figure out what the fuck was going on. His friend stupidly recited the number that called him and they went on a detective hunt to find the guy and [[Internet_tough_guy|"fuck him up"]]. Honestguy called the number (which was of course spoofed from his local area code) and threatened an old lady who had no idea what the hell was going on. He then went on a rant about going around the corner to the gun shop to "get protected" and wanting to show up at the spoofed number's address.  As for his own safety, he mentions that he has a 10-foot fence around his house (an upgraded version of [[anonymous|closing the curtains]]) and [[buy a dog|5 dogs]].  In true black person fashion, he couldn't go without claiming that it might be justin.tv's fault that he got called, even mentioning a possible [[internet_lawsuit|lawsuit]].

Later pump apparently had been spoofing calls to other justin.tv users as Honestguy. The only documented exchange between him and one of the pissed off lifecasters was between some guy whose mother called Honestguy and threatened to call the cops on him. Hilarity ensued as the dumbass was too afraid to have him call again but Honestguy offered to have the guy call him back.  Seizing the opportunity, pump4life then called Honestguy pretending to be the idiot's dad and socialed his number out of him. More lulz ensued as Honestguy [[Legal threats|claimed]] that the [[FBI]] was investigating and that he was filing multiple police reports. It seems a bit odd that someone growing and selling marijuana would want the FBI anywhere near.

*'''news'''?
Apparently this pothead bum works for justin.tv now, I guess he got hired so he can get justin the best weed to smoke and finally upgrade his cardboard box to a hotel room.

When not calling other lifecasters to harass them (see above), loveless is an [[poor|art school student]] with a case of [[internet disease]].  As she is [[fat|neither attractive nor popular]], she is excluded from many of the [[lulz|lulzier]] shenanigans on justin.tv; however, she did notice this article:

===[http://www.justin.tv/audratv AudraTV]===
[[Image:audratv.jpg|thumb|[[bananaphone|Ring ring!]]]]
A college student who had some moderation issues in her chat.  Many users were [[banhammer|banned or silenced]] for arbitrary reasons, so [[internet detective|one of them]] pulled her [[dox]] and decided to call her instead.  Such an act was deliciously [[ironic]], given that she tried to keep her information private and would not disclose her college or city.  The caller told her to unban certain users and eventually had her pissed off at her own moderators.  Once everyone was unbanned, they resumed the [[put shoe on head]] requests, which were denied until the phone rang again...

*looks like she left the SS Titanic err I mean the SS JTV ship.

An [[ugly]], zit-ridden daycare-worker and her hairy boyfriend who had to remake their account after previous [[drama]].  One night, after viewing prank phone calls to other lifecasters, they made the mistake of [[asking for it|taunting]] the mysterious caller to find their number and call them.  Of course, [[anonymous]] delivered and the pair promptly [[shat]] themselves...but not before calling the spoofed number in the middle of the night.

*Update
looks like the zit-ridden camwhore don't broadcast anymore.

[[Missalyssum]] was a lifecaster. She made her debut mid 2007 where her main form of entertaining was talking to chatters whilst broadcasting herself eating, shitting, getting bitch slapped by her younger brother and singing along to irrelevant songs, practically doing nothing. Occasionally, she would show a tad bit of cleavage here and there, giggling and smiling- you know, the usual slutty/preppy lingo.
