[[File:LulzLogo2.png|thumb|Its logo.]]

[[Lulznet]] (also known as irc.scriptkiddiesrus.org) is no different from [[Lulz.net]], a website devoted to [[gay|homosexual]] [[furries]] raping the shit out of each other. Reports indicate they have a similar-sounding name because Anonymous can't think of anything more original than the word "lulz". Lulznet is a group of wannabe /i/nsurgents corrupted by [[fags]] who think they own the chans. Lulznet is like the [[Jews|World Bankers Organization]] of the chans. Their goal, besides the [[did it for the lulz|lulz]], is to unite all chans into one New Chan Order or some other bullshit.

On October 19th, 2007, all 9 supporters of [[Lulznet]] decided they weren't acting [[butthurt]] enough and hadn't created enough [[drama]] to satisfy their burning need for [[attention whore|attention]].  Thus, a [[DDoS]] attack was launched against [[4chan]]. [[bullshit|This solved everyone's problems in a mature, responsible manner, and the internet went back to normal.]] 

The downtime following this cowardly decision has been so originally termed "[[The Caturday Nap]] of 10/20/07".

==Origins of the network==
[[Image:Januszeal.jpg|right|thumb|Would you trust this faggot with your IRC server?]]

Somewhere in the cesspool of social decay and human filth raidfags decided it would be a good idea to drag everyone else down to their level of retardation. While all the other chans, and ED too, had their own channels and were as happy as could be, [[4chan|4channers]] with [[4chan|4channers]], [[7chan|7channers]] with [[7chan|7channers]], [[pedophilia|12channers]] with the rest of the [[pedophilia|pedos]], this [[i/|/i/nsurgent]] says "Why don't we just combine them all?" This was an absolutely fabulous idea. Except of course that [[Kirtaner]] uses a shitty IRCd and [[12chan]] is [[lazy]] and [[moot]] was eating soup and, shockingly, ''nobody fucking likes each other''.  But our good friends, the 3% Fuckwit Patrol, went ahead with it anyhow because they envisioned themselves becoming [[internet celebrity|Kings of the Internet]].

==[[The Caturday Nap]]==
[[Image:Failurei.png|right|thumb|Butthurt kid who found a GNAA chan spammer.]]

Then someone had the bright idea to enter #4chan on Rizon and demand that [[diaperfur|moot]] and [[unwarranted self-importance|ALTERNATIVE]] join [[Lulznet]] or suffer their wrath.  Apparently, [[User:Kakama5]] thought this would [[fail|work]].  [[diaperfur|moot]] said he didn't care, much to [[noone|everyone's]] surprise.  He claimed he had [[brb soup|other issues]] at hand and left.  The [[DDoS]] began, [[4chan]] [[The Caturday Nap|went down]], and a massive [[shit]]storm was whipped up, the likes of which had not been seen in weeks, perhaps even months.  [[4chan]] [[fags|mods]] bawwwed at each other, bawwwed at the users, and bawwwed at Lulznet.  [[7chan]] [[fags|mods]] bawwwed at anyone who would listen, Raidchan [[fags|mods]] continued masturbating to [[furry]] scat porn, and eventually [[Lulznet]] sank into a pool of its own gurgling, glistening [[failure]], like some hideous misinterpretation of [[God]]'s work being sucked into a primordial tar pit.

The [[DDoS]] attacks on [[4chan]] stopped early in the morning on the 21st of October, but [[diaperfur|moot]] acted like a [[butthurt]] little [[bitch]] and wouldn't turn the site back on for days.  [[7chan]], disabled by a tag-team of [[faggot]] bandwagon kiddies and [[mod]] [[abuse]], redirected to [[Habbo Hotel]] for a time.  Since the raidfags still felt a hint of loyalty to 420chan which previously housed them, it remained untouched and continued to make the entire world just a little bit [[gay|gayer]] every day by existing.

==What Started It==
''Caution: What follows are some of the most [[butthurt]], childish, furry-raping antics you will ever see on the internet.  If you are not a ten-assed shit-stomping cock shelf, you will be disgusted by the passage below.  If you are a ten-assed shit-stomping cock shelf, welcome home. It should also be mentioned that one [[Anonymous]] with [[unwarranted self-importance|delusions of grandeur]], [[unwarranted self-importance|Kakama]], pretending he is [[Star Trek|The Borg]], is not representative of [[Anonymous]] as a whole''.

<pre>
<Locutus_of_Lulz> We are Locutus of Anonymous
<Locutus_of_Lulz> You will respond to our questions.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> Your use of a public IRC netowrk is less efficent for Anonymous and to you.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> We have established a large and stable network, just for Anonyous
<Locutus_of_Lulz> Lulznet.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> irc.lulz.net
<Locutus_of_Lulz> aka irc.partyvan.org aka irc.lulzhost.net
<Locutus_of_Lulz> It is the combined servers of many chans.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> 7chan has joind, fapchan as well; 420chan will when they update their server software.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> the /i/nsurgents built it off our several servers.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> The Patriotic Nigras have added their servers.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> Great things are afoot.
<Locutus_of_Lulz> We will await your return
<Locutus_of_Lulz> But we know that moving #4chan onto the central node is most efficent for all parties.
<moots> not happening
<moots> irc is stupid
<moots> go away
</pre>

<pre>
<Locutus_of_Loli> We do not wish to hinder the progress of 4chan
<Locutus_of_Loli> But we must sadly attack until /b/ conforms to the will of Anonymous.
<Locutus_of_Loli> We shall double the dataforce.
<moots> uh okay
<moots> i am going to go make soup now
</pre>

==Lulznet tries to make a sucessful /i/==
After 420chan died, d0d.cc died, and all the other failure /i/ boards died, the [[gay|administrators]] of lulznet thought they should  take a shot at it. Their shot was off by miles. On 11/19 their board was flooded, and is still being flooded as of 11/20.

Once the flooding died, it was actually almost ideal as /i/ in that it had a gore background and was hosted overseas, in Taiwan.  7chan linked to it under the name /joey/ for a time, until it was too slow for them to give a fuck.  Of course ‘hosted’ is used in the sense that a parasite sneaks into a host and hides there, without the server owner, er, the host, knowing they are there.  Due to this it is even slower then ED, and everyone uses [[711chan]] for /i/ with Partyvan as a backup.
