A commonly-used­­­­­ phrase that describes the socially inept: [[Love Shy|love shys]], [[loser|losers]], [[Fanboys]], [[cosplay | cosplayers]], [[nerd]]s, [[slashfic]] authors, [[gamers]], [[weeaboos]], [[libertarianism|libertarians]], [[anarchists]], [[furfags]], [[/b/tards]], [[Star Trek|trekkies,]] [[World of Warcraft | WoW players]], [[Ediots]], [[Wikipedia]] editors, [[You|you]], and most of all [[trolls]]. In other words, peo­­­ple who know that the light of day will expose them for [[You|the freaks they are]]; Thus,[[you|they]] go on ED or [[you|they]] dwell in their [[parents]]' basement, [[fap]]ping while being ever so [[Politically incorrect|POLITICALLY INCORRECT :coolface:]] on the internet and live off [[pocky]] and [[KFC]].

==Habitats==

Note, however, that while most basement-dwellers do indeed live in a [[basement]], this is not always the case. A basement-dweller needs only to live under the care of their parents long after he or she has the facu­­lties necessary to become a [[W|contributing member of society]]. This includes being a twenty year old unemployed [[college]] dropout whose mother pays your rent (however, some basement dwellers will go to college and get a degree, only to return to their parents' house and fap like there is no tomorrow [see "A Confederacy of Dunces"]). Some "basement dwellers" still live in their parent's normal house as they did when they grew up, particularly if the house doesn't have a basement as is often the case in [[Europe]] and Texas because texans don't believe in basements-they are unholy. Others still live in their [[Chris-chan|parent's bedroom]].

Excluded from the title basement-dweller are people wh­o live with their parents for legitimate reasons. One must remember there i­­s a difference between [[Incest|"living <b>with</B> mommy"]], and Jew Some examples of this include:

* [[Fap]]ping at home between semesters of college
* No point in moving out if your college is a block away.
* Living at home because of financial problems (guess McDonald's doesn't pay as much as they used to)
* Living at home to assist in the [[Lemonparty|care of one's own elderly parents]].
* [[Furry|A very small minority of people who have or had a very serious and prolonged illness]]

Typical basement-dwellers are needlessly burdensome on their parents and/or government. Most of their time is taken up [[masturbating]] to [[furry art|furry porn]] and [[online sex games]], going to [[con|nerdish conventions]], eating chees­­­­­­e doodles, and playing [[D&D]]. In addition, as [[completist]]s, they spend an inordinate amount of time on the [[Internets]], using [[IRC]], [[LiveJournal]], partaking in [[Bandwidth_envy]], and arguing vehemently over their particular branch of [[fandom]]. And yes, you will still be a basement-dweller, even after you've finished building yo­ur new [[shit nobody cares about|"v0.1 2X Overdrive dual-ballast dual-T8-tube 128W 6,500k daylight fluorescent light]]." If you are an [[engineer]] or geologist, [[Vietnam|dig secret tunnel networks]] (or just [[series of tubes|a pressurized capsule network to transport M:tG cards]]) while making secret entrances to find D&D bong sessions and [[plastic crap]].

'''How can I tell if an otherwise typical lolcow is a basement-dweller?'''
:There's a drop ceiling in the­­ir hideous webcam stills, and there's no way that said ceiling is in their "office," as they will claim.  Wood paneling is also a dead giveaway.

Don't be fooled by the presence of a microwave, as the suspect's mother's kitchen can be used to throw people off the scent, but concentrate on the distinctive pallor of the individual's complexion which reveals their subterranean habitat.

A prime example of [[faggot|basement-dweller]]s and/or [[weeaboo]] [[cock|dick]]s.

==Basement-Dwellers & [[Trolls]]==

No - not [[trolls|internet wankers]] like [[4Chan]], but the mythical creatures from Scandinavia. Symptoms include:

*Suffering from greasy skin and warts caused by a lack of washing and living off junk food brought dow­n by their moms every 30 minutes, because they are lite­rally unable to move from in front of their computers.
*Poor eyesight caused by the endless glare o­­­­f the computer screens or because they are [[asians]].
*Rotting teeth caused by grinding them <s>during [[flame wars|sex]]</s> <i>[[fap|thinking about sex]]</i>.
*[http://www.triplestarnews.com/images/the_memo/bonedog/tech_soul/bad_technology.html Poor social life] brought on by virtually no IRL interaction (mom bringing you down cookies - and some more boxes of [[fap|tissues]] - doesn't count). 
*A serious weight problem - they are either [[fat|grossly bloated]] or [[pro-ana|hideously 
skinny]]. The ones with [[neckbeard|neckbeards]] are funnier, particularly when coupled with moobs.

Of course the majority of basement-dwellers are actually [[trolls]], and vice-versa.

==[[weeaboo|Hikikomori]]== 

[[weeaboo|引きっこもり. Japanese basement-dweller.]]  Only difference being most japanese live in apartments, which do not have a basement.  Even Japanese houses don't have basements, apparently prohibited by laws.

{{squote|Hikikkomori ­­live a nocturnal life, in a deep depressive state, far from social responsibilities (sch­ool, work, family) and activities. Even sexuali­­ty is often virtually lived and connected to a sexy manga heroine.|Francesco Jodice|describing the subject of his [http://www.francescojodice.com/video/hikikomori_eng.mov film]}}

[[shit nobody cares about|Interestingly enough]], Hikikomori seem to feel that [[BAW|they've got it worse]] than their western counterp­arts. A Japanese basement-dweller will often explain that [[Japanese]] culture is so simultaneously repressive and demandin­g tha­t they've never properly adap­ted t­­o­ it, causing them to wet themselves if they venture out into the public[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gIx6hZweHc]. Unlike their western­ counterparts, it is estimated that more than ha­­­lf of all­ Hikikkomori abuse/ beat their parents, which makes them far more [[An Hero|cooler]] while remaining anti-social losers. Male Hikikkomori may also e­xplain that they feel they lack social role models because their fathers are entirely pussy-whipped. The large percentage of western basement-dwellers who have to import their [[Pocky]] and download their [[shota]] likely beg to differ. 

''[[Rozen Maiden]]'' has a Hikikkomori as a main character. Much like ''[[Shit|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' before it, having a loser protagonist they could identify with meant that American [[Weeaboo|weeaboos]] latched onto the show like parasitic lamprey, only this time the "sexy manga heroines" and cartoon lust objects weren't [[Neon Genesis Evangelion|overstacked expressionless doll-like girls]], but [[Desu|ACTUAL DOLLS]].

[[Zombie#Max_Brooks|Max Brooks]]' ''[[Faggotry|World War Z]]'' features an hikikomori who becomes an famous [[Crap|hero]] after the [[Zombie Apocalypse]], eh slicing off zombie heads and not afraiding anyone with the help of an [[Lemon party|old]], blind, [[Marijuana#Cannabis|gardener]].  The idea that an hikikomori could ever do anything useful for anyone is the least believable element of [[Shit nobody cares about|the previous sentence]].

For a lighthearted and accurate look at the life of a Hikikkokomori, see the delightful shareware game, [[Yume Nikki]]. In it, a young girl overcomes her deepest fears and becomes [[an hero]] to Hikikkomori and [[Weeaboo]] all over the world. There's also the anime "Welcome to the NHK" which is mostly noteworthy because it doesn't involve power levels and robots for once, the protagonist is a lunatic and, most importantly, unlike [[you]] he wants to change his life and not remain an inept loser by doing something.

==Cellar-dweller==

A '''cellar-dweller''' is not to be confused with a '''basement-dweller'''. Although a person can be both, they might also be one but not the other. Some people are neither, but this article is not about them.

A cellar-dweller might claim to live on the main floor of a house in that they occasionally sleep there, eat there or fetch food from the main floor. The cellar-dweller might even ''own'' the house. However, cellar-dwellers remain in their cellar or basement most of the time because they have chosen to abandon the outside world for the inside world of fantasy tabletop battlegames, similar online or computer games, or some other extremely time-consuming hobby like counterfeiting, manufacturing drugs or [[Josef Fritzl|raping the shit out of your secret prisoner]].

Cellar-dwellers all over the world rejoiced in 1998 when death punk band [http://www.anotherstateofmind.net/antiworld%20home.htm Antiworld] wrote a song just for them, entitled 'Cellar Dweller.'

==Music==
