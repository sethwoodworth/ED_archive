[[Djdlikesxbox]] is a [[13 year old boy]] from [[California]] who got [[troll]]ed to the point of [[butt-hurt]].

== The meeting ==
[[user:l4wl|l4wl]] was in a random IRC channel and got ASLed. After using his standard 14/f/cali response, he was met by a "15/m/ca" followed by "where do you go to school?". l4wl responded "i go to centennial HS in riverside". Seeing the opportunity for [[lulz]], l4wl quickly said his name was Katie Johnson. Eventually in [[AIM]] this turned to epic proportions when DJ fell in love, sending pics of himself holding signs saying that he loved Katie and drawing all over his hand. DJ's awful grammar made typical [[IRC]] conversations seem like [[Pain Series|classic literature]].

== Logs ==
The narrated and annotated conversation can be found at [[djdlikesxbox/Convo]].
