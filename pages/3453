{{youtube2|Gothguurl1989|Gothguurl1989}}, or <s>Wendy</s> Zed, is a [[YouTube]] [[troll]] and [[emo]] attention whore.  According to <s>his/her</s> it's profile they were "once a member of pretentious peoples", but now are completely [[mundane|humble]].  Gothguurl's videos are [[typically]] about someone called "Tasco" [[wat|who apparently is actually Wendy]].  When not threatening his viewers with a butcher knife, [[tranny|He/she/it]] is most likely just a another [[unemployed]] actor on the tubes play acting some asinine and unthoughtout "character" he/she/it came up with one day whilst going down on he/she/it's [[boyfriend]]/[[girlfriend]]/[[Zoophile|significant other]].  Their [[pretentious|risque]] [[cosplay|performance art]] videos have been polluting the tubes since March '08 and he/she/it dreams of someday making the [[luser|D-list]] and becoming an [[internet celebrity]], whilst struggling [[irl]] just to score a gig at a local dinner theater.  

<s>Gothguurl was later revealed to be [[ORLY|a dude]], just some ugly [[douchebag]] with a goatee - basically just [[scroll up]] and read the first part again. </s>

===Update 2009===
Recently, it was discovered Gothgurrl1989 is someone else or '''something else'''. Due to disinformation supplied by [[butthurt]] [[troll]]s, Wendy updated her channel with yet another mysteriously boring [[vlog]]. Wendy is also [[notable]] for being "dark", and "disturbing" according [[ED]] [[hero]] [[TTT]]. It is suggested you approach Wendy with her [[noodz]], as to disable her ability to read gothic poetry.
