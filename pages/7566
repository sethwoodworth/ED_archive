SlashAIMslash

[[Image:SlashAIMslash guy.jpg|thumb|They even went as far as giving /aim/ its own mascot. It just goes to show how original and creative those guys were, throwing away any relations to /b/ and 4chan and starting anew.]]

On June 18th, 2008, when [[moot]] was drunk off his ass and trolling the [[internet|Masters of the Internet]] by telling them that [[/b/]] was going to [[die]], four /b/fags who fell for it made up their minds to become moots of their own and separated from the legion and decided to bring in a new sense of [[memes]], [[lulz]], and other [[virgin|virgin-riffic]] topics for the /b/tard who likes instant communication (as if /b/ isn't rapid enough already)

Hence, the creation of /aim/ (or '''/aimchan/''' or '''slashAIMslash''' because putting /aim at the end of the URL takes you to the actual AOL Instant Messenger, and putting //aim/ or simply /aim/ takes you to a page labeled Aim/, and that's just assholish.) was made by four [[Anonymous]] members who, due to the nature of [[AIM]], could no longer remain Anonymous (so much for all the [[Fox News]] coverage) They were Bleistiftsp1tzer, redsAnzuri2796, AtomicDuck721, and TheREALAmerica (not the one that [[Amerifags]] live on – [[lie|word has it that that one is all fake]]).

It quickly came about when they made a thread on /b/ about the last AOL Screenname thread. Soon, /b/tards posted their screennames (because posting your personal information on a website that's gotten on the news before for hacking and ruining peoples lives is clearly the smart thing to do), and a [[chat|chat room]] was made.

“watchat”, created by Bleistiftsp1tzer, was the first chat room in which topics of casual discourse were engaged in. In other words, it became /b/ in a matter of seconds. The downside being that no one was Anonymous anymore because of their screennames, an upside was that you could now send messages more faster than ever before on /b/. For instance, a user could say black person over and over again with no flood detection screen [[cock block|cock blocking]] him. Questions were asked, such as “Do [[girls]] [[poop]]?” While the obvious answer is [[no]], alleged female users said that they do indeed squeeze 'em out. Of course, declaring yourself a female in a room filled with 30 <s>manly</s> virgins pretty much resulted in you being an open target for an Internet [[rape|raep]].

Also created in seconds on /aim/ were modified and new memes. For instance, TheREALAmerica was the first to say “Don't mind me, I'm on up way up towards the top of the page.” And, uh, 

...

Wait.

That was pretty much the only meme carried over from /b/ and he said it like five times and no one cared. But what people did care about was Morgan Bogle, the first official meme to generate from the new branch of the Internet's shithole.

Like most intelligent memes on /b/, it was just copied and pasted over and over again by all the users who were in /aim/ at that time. Despite being created in a matter of seconds, /aim/ users were already demanding original content and were calling any of those who merely [[copypasta]] the name newfags who didn't even know what they were doing. ([[Newfag|Ring any bells?]]) The creator of the meme was redsAnzuri2796. When asked what inspired him to make it, he just said he had to [[spam]] the name. He (because, just like the Internet, there are no girls on AIM), also said that the name was “bogletizing” when said in one's head over and over again. Again, in a matter of seconds, random AIM users became [[victim|victims]] of the new [[Rickroll|roll]] of the Internet,
[[Image:Morgan Bogle.jpg|thumb|Morgan Bogle. [[Serious Business]].]]
the “bogleroll”, in which users were IMed the name “Morgan Bogle”, which was a link that sent them, when clicked, to Morgan's picture.

[[LOL WUT]]

Picture?

[[OH SHI-]]

TheREALAmerica (again, trying to be the over glorifying bastard that he is) was the first /aim/ user to copypasta the picture of Morgan Bogle, and ultimately made the face in which that is Bogle. He was also the first fag to get banned and kicked from /aim/. That was a bitchy problem. Constantly IMing the same shit over and over again would piss of /aim/'s [[moderators]] (who are stationed in the center of the [[Earth]]) and you would be accused of spamming and ejected from the room. Thankfully, fellow /aim/tards would invite their kicked brothers back in, and the same moronic shit would constantly be said over and over again to the point where people would just get pissed off and leave and then come back again. ([[4chan|Wait, that does sound familiar...]])

[[tl;dr]] – Four fags who thought [[/b/]] was really gonna [[die]] went on [[AIM]] and invited people to a chat so that they could cry about it with their other virgin friends. [[Chaos|Chaos ensued]], new [[memes]] were made, and /b/ was made again the form of a [[chat|chat room]]. [[This is why we can't have nice things]].

==HOW DOES I /aim/?==
[[Image:Signing-of-constitution.jpg|thumb|An artist's rendition of what a typical /aim/ chat room looks like. So far, most agree that this is arguably the most accurate portrayal of an internet community. Note the emphasis on the different colored fonts.]]
1. LOG ONTO AIM.
<br>
2. GO TO /b/.
<br>
3. MAKE /aim/ THREAD AND TELL PEOPLE TO COME TO YOUR [[Lie|BAD-ASS CHAT ROOM SESSION.]]
<br>
4. ON AIM, GO TO FIND OR CREATE CHAT ROOM THINGY SHIT. OR JUST HAVE SOME SOON-NOT-TO-BE-ANONYMOUS DUDER INVITE YOU.
<br>
5. LOG ON, SPEAK INTELLECTUALLY, AND, WHEN ASKED, YOUR A/S/L IS 69/69/69. (Don't even try saying your location is "confusion". AOL doesn't like its users to be in that state, so therefore it bans those words from ever being said. But yet, it allows people to say "horny 14 year old seeking hung and uncut cock. Got pix." I mean, it doesn't make any sense. I don't even think about it anymore to be honest with you, because I just keep getting so damn confuse... ''hey...'') 
<br>
6. MOST LIKELY GET KICKED. GET INVITED BACK IN BY NEW INTERNET BEST FRIEND.
<br>
7. REPEAT.
<br>
8. [[????]]
<br>
9. [[PROFIT!]]
