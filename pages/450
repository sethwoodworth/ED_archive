Andrew Allred
Andew Allred (known online as bomber166) was a [[Maddox]] [[fanboi]], wannabe [[Goon]], and confirmed pant shitter asshole  who was a piece of shit who [[bullshit|suffered]] from [[Assburgers]] and being a [[fagnostic]]. On September 24, 2007, Allred shot and killed his ex-girlfriend, Tiffany Barwick, and a mutual friend named Michael Ruschak whom Tiffany was friends with. Instead of becoming [[an hero]] Allred was arrested and thrown in [[jail]], where he promptly forgave himself and started writing letters to Tiffany's parents. Later he was sentenced to the death and is now sitting on death row (alone, due to other prisoners complaining about the smell).

==What Happened==
[[Image:Andrew Allred.jpg|right|thumb|Andrew Allred, visibly troubled.]] 
[[Image:Tiffany Barwick.jpg|right|thumb|Tiffany Barwick, [[Fat girl angle shot|did it wrong]].]]

Tiffany Barwick was a 19-year-old Florida native and a beautiful girl with a limitless future. In late 2006 she moved in with [[downsie]] life-long [[basement-dweller]], Andrew Allred. Allred was exactly what you'd expect of a [[Goon]]: emotionally retarded and easily amused. Allred spent his time playing with his computer and [http://www.angrysquirrelproductions.com/ blowing shit up with his friends], while Tiffany felt increasingly taken for granted and isolated from her own friends.

The situation came to a head in August, 2007. Tiffany decided to break up with Allred and move out but, in a fit of [[Theoretical Physics|girl logic]], postponed the breakup until after Allred's 21<sup>st</sup> birthday to avoid ruining the celebration. She explained all of this [[:image:Tiffany_breakup.jpg|in her GreatestJournal]] the Tuesday ''before'' the party. 

===Allred's Birthday Party===

[[Image:Michael Ruschack.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Ruschak: "DON'T SHOOT!"]]
[[Image:Allred Target Practice.jpg|right|thumb|Target practice.]]

Described by the Orlando Sentinel as a "[[:Image:OSun_kegger.gif|righteous two-kegger]]," the event was a combined birthday party for Allred and Ruschak. It's not clear whether Allred read Tiffany's GreatestJournal before the party, but either way, the whole thing was an inevitable train-wreck. 

Tiffany kept her distance from Allred for most of the night. Allred got drunk, poured beer on everyone in sight, and generally enjoyed himself. Finally, Allred started throwing firecrackers past Tiffany's head. Tiffany announced that their relationship was over and her friends went to get Tiffany's things. Allred decided to help by hurling Tiffany's belongings—including her laptop—toward the road. Words and rocks were exchanged. During the altercation, Michael Ruschak's sister had to be told twice and was punched in the chest. Finally the [[partyvan|cops]] arrived and told everyone to [[STFU]].

Tiffany went to Ruschak's apartment where she had planned to stay after breaking up with Allred.

===The Aftermath===

<!-- End chatlog section -->
Allred handled the breakup as well as any [[Aspie]] could—he freaked out like he was missing Wapner. He either already had or quickly obtained Tiffany's passwords, and for the next four weeks tormented Tiffany in any way he could think of.

===The Day of the Murder===
{{Q2|like.. durring you have this look... like your eyes... and it just like.. shoots threw me|Tiffany Barwick (CrazedIncuChic)|employing an unfortunate turn of phrase}} 
Allred bought a gun on September 1. It's unclear when Ruschak and Tiffany slept together and when Allred found out, but by September 24 he was [[:Image:Angry_squirrel_post.gif|obsessed]]. He quit his job and spent the afternoon drinking and calling his  friends and family. 

Coincidentally, Tiffany contacted police that morning to report that Allred had sent her a bullet-riddled photograph of herself and to allege that he'd withdrawn money from her bank account. Later that day she spoke with deputies again, explaining that Allred had just sent Ruschak an e-mail reading "The next time I see you, I'm going to kill you." She begged for Allred to be locked up. The deputies [[lolled]] and told Tiffany to [[Gb2|GB2/kitchen/]] to get what she [[Domestic_violence|had coming to her]].

Meanwhile, Allred vandalized Tiffany's [[MySpace]] account, making her profile private except for the message "I'm a whore." Then, using her Facebook account, he scheduled an "[[:Image:Fuckme_Party.gif|Everyone Fuck Me Party!]]" for later that evening. Either Ruschak accepted the invitation or Allred also accessed his account and accepted for him. Tiffany and Ruschak were the only confirmed guests for the [[buttsecks|event]]. Allred then blanked his own web site and replaced it with this:

:<P style="FONT-SIZE: large;">I'm Out! </P>
:<P style="FONT-SIZE: small;">You will find some interesting stuff here very soon:</P>
:[http://andrewallred.com/stuff/ http://andrewallred.com/stuff/]

===Everyone Fuck Me Party!=== 

{{Q2|If you havn't fucked her already and want to you should probley go for it now.|Andrew Allred (bomber166)|Angry Squirrel Production Forums}}

Allred drove to Ruschak's house and rammed Tiffany's car several times. He [[failed]] to kick in the front door, so he ran around the house and shot out a sliding glass door. Once inside he shot Ruschak five times, killing him. One of the several witnesses inside the house attempted to take the gun from Allred and was shot in the leg. Allred went to the bathroom where Tiffany was hiding and shot her seven times, killing her. [[ADHD|He then turned and left]]. Police later apprehended him, [[fail|alive]], near his home. At his arraignment he pled [[coward|not guilty]], and is currently writing [[confession|love letters]] to Tiffany from his cell (see [[Andrew_Allred#Troll's Remorse|Troll's Remorse]], below).

==Public Reactions==

A large number of the [http://www.topix.com/forum/city/geneva-fl/TA957MROUV5P7QPNU initial responses] to the story—being left by the kind of [[comment whore|idiots]] who leave comments on the internet—contain a high level of unintentional [[lulz]] and [[trolling]].

{{squote|Anyone that has not armed themselves in the day and age we are living in are a statistic waiting to happen! Anyone busting through my door is getting a one way ticket to the morgue! I fully understand that I might be going along side them too but it won't be for lack of self defense! The thought of being huddled together with my wife and not being able to defend her, or getting pistol whipped in front of her just does not appeal to me, not to mention the likelihood of the perp killing you both before leaving even if you cooperated. Sudden death syndrome or acute lead poisoning is not the worst possible scenario in the violent crime arena of today!

===<span style="display: none;">Goondolences</span>[[Image:Goondolences.gif|Goondolences]]===

[[Goons]] quickly sprang into action, analyzing the spread of Allred's grouping patterns, misinterpreting the chat logs he posted, and generally being [[Goons]]. <s>Epic</s> Goldmine threads were started on the [[SA]] and [[SASS]] [http://sass.buttes.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=10404 forums].

Just as the story began to die down, another detail emerged. Allred wrote several letters to Tiffany's parents from his jail cell and simply couldn't understand why his missives weren't well received. A Florida judge ordered Allred to stop contacting Tiffany's family, but not before he managed to mail a birthday card in anticipation of Tiffany's upcoming birth date.
