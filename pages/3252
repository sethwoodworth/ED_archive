Gay.pl

'''Gay.pl''' is a [[script]] written by the evil [[cj]] to produce various profoundly [[homosexual]] [[ASCII]] images on [[IRC]]. It is also the main website for [[faggots]] in [[Poland]], but [[nobody gives a fuck]].

==Features==
Gay.pl features a number of wonderfully faggoty features that I love.

* /Gay - Like /say, but makes it gay.
* /Gaycat - cat's a file, but makes it gay.
* /Gayexec - execs a UNIX command, but makes it gay.
* /gay update - gay.pl's self-updating feature. Fuckin' impressive.
* /gv - Announces the version of gay.pl you are using, like the huge cockloving faggot you are.

With the exception of update, you can pass some f(l)ags to heighten the gayness of the experience.

* -1 - Color gradient - Rainbow colors
* -2 - Color gradient - Red, White, and Blue. If you don't use -2, the terrorists win
* -3 - Color gradient - Random colors
* -4 - Color gradient - One random color, plus another a few shades away
* -5 - Alternating greys
* -6 - Greyscale
* -7 - Festive colors
* -8 - [[Canadan]] colors
* -repeat x - Repeat this action x number of times. Very awesome if you have CAN_FLOOD
* -matrix - Makes text vertical. Very LOL.
* -figlet - Makes a horizontal banner. Good for making sure EVERYONE READS WHAT YOU SAY.
* -banner - Makes an [[xbox|XBOX HUEG]] vertical banner. Works best with CAN_FLOOD 
** '''Note:''' -figlet and -banner [[divide by zero|DO NOT MIX]].

[[We]] at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] recommend <code>/gay -1 -matrix -repeat 500 "LOL HAY GUYZ " </code> to provide [[max]]imal [[annoy]]ance. Remember to leave that space in the quotes so the text looks extra pretty. Also, you need [[flood]]ing rights, so don't bother doing this on [[Freenode]]. One user I got [[kline]]d in 3 seconds.

There are other f(l)ags - try /gay help.

==Caveats==
People will fucking [[hate]] you.
