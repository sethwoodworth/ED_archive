'''WHY''' is a [[meme]], showing a picture of [[Epic Beard Man|Tony Kornheiser]] of [[sp|ESPN]]'s Pardon the Interruption with the word “WHY” underneath it. It became popular in late 2009 after a person on [[sp|/sp/]] posted a screenshot of Pardon The Interruption where Tony Kornheiser and black person talked about WHY the Indianapolis Colts’ made the decision to rest Peyton Manning in a game against the Jets, which they ended up losing. Across the bottom of the screen, it said, “WHY did the Colts give up?” The meme continued in a thread where a person asked “WHY do you follow the teams you follow?” with a picture of just Tony Kornheiser’s face and the word “WHY” from the bottom of the screen.

The meme has expanded to nearly every board on 4chan, most notably /v/ and /mu/. Many variations of it exist because /b/ is comprised of delusion retards who don't know WHY they make memes out of anything.
