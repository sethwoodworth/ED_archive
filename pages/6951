Restimulation
__NOTOC__


'''Restimulation''' is a [[scilon|Scientology term]] which describes how a person can [[cake|remember]] certain past [[Bullshit|past life experiences]] by being subjected to various images or sounds, such as [[lemon party]]. Through <s>training</s> vigorous anal sex, [[idiots|Scientologists]] become convinced that they have lived past lives as [[Otherkin|people, objects or animals]]. Be aware, as those who have been "Restimulated," especially [[jam it in|up the pooper]], will immediately attempt to defend their pathetic position by summoning [[Xenu]] to smite your soul. In theory, this horrific event would render you [[retard|retarded]]. Physically, you will witness a raving lunatic pour [[jenkem]] from a flask onto their empty skull, then penetrate their navel with their own [[penis]] (It appeases [[Xenu]]).

{{quote|Restimulation: the “awakening” of an old engram, which occurs when a person’s present environment contains enough similarities to the elements found in the engram to cause a reactivation of it. When an engram is restimulated, a person can experience similar pains and emotions to those contained in the original incident.|So [[your mom|deep]].}}
