Are your pets embarrassed about being neutered? Their four-legged friends need never know, thanks to Neuticles.com, a [[website]] created by Gregg A. Miller of Oak Grove, [[Missouri]], to sell testicular implants that restore the look if not the function of recently removed body parts on [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, and even [[horse]]s (US Patent #58-68140).

In an especially [[Boob|nice touch]], this website opens with a [[flash]] animation of a bouncing ball (naturally). Yes, these cosmetic [[ball|cojones]] are no joke; prices start at $69 a pair. Not to be confused with [http://www.bumpernuts.com/index.html BumperNuts], which provide a similar service for your car.

Many horrified citizens, upon learning about neuticles, have naturally written strongly-worded letters to their congressmen demanding that Gregg A. Miller be hunted down, restrained, and, under local anaesthesia, have huge 90-pound neuticles sewn into each of his facial and [[ass|buttal]] cheeks. This would only be fair. This legislation is currently scheduled for review in the Senate, as soon as [[Larry Craig]] returns from the men's room where he's been since [[last thursday]].


== Origins ==
[[Image:Gregg Miller.jpg|thumb|120px|Gregg, Buck and a pair of neuticles.]]
Like all [[you|maniac]]s, Miller started with an experiment on an unwitting dog, after his Bloodhound named Buck disappeared and was located days later over 20 miles away. Buck had picked up the scent of a female dog in heat. ''"It was either neuter Buck or go through the nightmare of him taking off again and the next time I most likely wouldn't find him"'', Miller told the press.

Miller deserved the 2005 Ig Nobel Prize in Medicine [[for great justice]].
