Led by certified [[bicurious]] [[insane|kook]] and [[attention whore]] '''Marshall Herff Applewhite''', the '''Heaven's Gate''' cult were a [[California]] based, batshit crazy UFO '[[religion]]'. They believed that they could ride on a [[Jesus]] powered [[UFO|spaceship]] that was hiding behind the comet Hale-Bopp if they drank [[Kool-Aid]] upon its arrival.

Sometime in the mid-90's, Herff and his cultists moved into a mansion in [[San Diego]], where they practiced an ascetic lifestyle, denying themselves [[alcohol]] and [[sex]].  The cultists were known for their love of ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', and [[computers]]. During this period, some cult members worked as [[nerds|website designers]], leading some to suggest that the [[internets]] was related to their mass-[[an_hero|heroism]].  

In April, 1997, Comet Hale-Bopp appeared and so the cult [[suicide|beamed up]] to the awaiting spaceship. 39 bodies were found [[dead]] in bunk beds, flat on their backs clad in black pants, black shirts, brand new black Nikes, and purple armbands reading [[Star Trek|"Heaven's Gate Away Team"]]. Their faces were covered with purple cloths, a [[PROTIP|nod]] to the shrouds of [[Christian]] penance. Each member carried $5.00 in quarters for use on the spaceship which Jesus had kindly [[Pimp My Ride|pimped out]] with an arcade and vending machines.

The [[true believers|cultists]] died by taking [[drugs|barbiturates]] mixed into [[cum|pudding]] with a shot of [[vodka]] back. They sealed [[suicide|the deal]] by putting plastic bags over their heads and hitting themselves with bricks.

The Heaven's Gate [[cult]] were heeding the words of the Jew:
{{quote|Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die and not live. Wear Nikes for [[great justice]] bitches!|Isaiah}}
