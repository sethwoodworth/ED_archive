Exploding Van
[[Image:Yellowvan.gif|thumb|Now in [[gif]] form!]]
'''Exploding Van''' is yet another in a series of [[WIN]] unforced [[/b/]] [[meme]]s that came raining down from the heavens like golf ball-sized hail as if a gift from the [[Internets]] [[Allah|Gods]]. This was spawned by a [[Corruption of LOL|Corrupted LOL]]s epidemic that spread thru the [[tubes]] during The Great [[Fox News]] Outing of [[Anonymous]] and their steroid fueled hacking that took place over the historic weekend of July 27th, [[2007]].

The meme comes from a video of an exploding yellow van that was inter-cut with other [[Fox]] footage like the [[football]] stadiums in the [[2006]] [[Jake_Brahm|NFL Bomb Plot]], to suggest that [[Anonymous]] were not only [[:Image:Steroids hackers.jpg|HACKERS ON STEROIDS]] but [[ALF|domestic terrorists]].

Not to be confused with [[Party Van]], though the two vans are often combined anyway.
