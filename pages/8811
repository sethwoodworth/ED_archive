[[Last Thursday]], '''Virgin Media''' got itself a [http://www.techwatch.co.uk/2008/03/07/virgin-media%E2%80%99s-ceo-position-confirmed/ New CEO]. One with possibly no brains yet very large [[balls]]:

{{tinyquote|"The new CEO of Virgin Media, Neil Berkett, has openly stated in an interview that they think net neutrality is "[http://www.boingboing.net/2008/04/13/virgin-media-ceo-net.html A load of bollocks]" and claimed they're already doing deals to deliver some people's content faster than others. They would then put websites and services that don't pay Virgin in the "slow lane", meaning those sites would load slowly and cause most users to give up using them, feeling forced to use whatever Virgin wants to push through their network."}}

tl;dr: Burkett sez ''“FUCK YOU INTERNETZ! KILL TEH [[mudkip|MUDKIPZ]]!!1".''

[[Anonymous]] was not pleased, and due to their massive [[butthurt]], they are taking out their anger by raping Virgin (lol pun). No, but srsly. That bitch is going to get a bleeding [[vagina|vagoo]] from its broken hymen when this shit is done.

It began when a [[/b/tard]] posted [[copypasta]] from a [http://stopvirgin.movielol.org/ site] owned by WoWfag Athene, where him and his hawt bitch are talking about net neutrality.

{{squote|[[tl;dr|“Keep Virgin from destroying the internet... The new CEO of Virgin Media, Neil Berkett, has openly stated in an interview that they think net neutrality is “a load of bollocks” and claimed they're already doing deals to deliver some people’s content faster than others. They would then put websites and services that don't pay Virgin in the "slow lane", meaning those sites would load slowly and cause most users to give up using them, feeling forced to use whatever Virgin wants to push through their network.
This is not the first time an internet provider infringes upon net neutrality, but it is the first time that an ISP so brutally states that they simply plan to limit internet access to a television-like system in which the access provider completely regulates the content you have access to.
Virgin Media has over 3.5 million customers in the UK and the real danger is that when they start applying this system to their network, all major internet providers around the globe will soon follow the trend. Because this is exactly what major ISP's have been wanting to do for [http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071021-comcast-traffic-blocking-even-more-apps-groupware-clients-affected.html years].
But we can stop it.
If the masses of the internet react against this, we will set an example of what happens when one provider tries to take away our freedom. We will make it very clear that any ISP who tries to infringe upon net neutrality will see its popularity go down the drain because the users don't accept it. And we'll see to it that only the providers who care about safeguarding our internet freedom have our support.”]]}}

'''The Basic Gist:''' Virgin make [[facebook|bad sites]] fast, [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|good sites]] slow.
