'''''Assassin's Creed''''' is the 100,000th franchise to be expelled  out of the corporate womb that is [[Ubisoft]]. The French-Canadians who developed this game ensured that it was warmer, steamier and a thousand times more smellier then your typical pile of [[crap]]. Credit must go to those Canadians however, because being able to produce a series whilst having a severe mental and physical disability is quite a feat.

The plot takes place three months [[2012|before the end of the world]], in September 2012 on the 11th anniversary of [[WTC|9/11]]. The [[Jews]] are celebrating 11 years of glorious uprising as the [[FBI]] are still trying to gather enough evidence to legally perform a second [[holocaust]]. A bartender named '''Desmond''' is kidnapped by a corporation (most likely a self-characterization of [[unwarranted self importance|Ubisoft]]) and forced into a machine that "recollects ancestral memories buried into the users DNA" because he is apparently the descendant of [[Jesus]] or some shit. Really, the entire game is a figment of Desmond's imagination, and thus anything you achieve whilst playing is automatically null and void.

Later Lucy takes you to some Assassin [[/b/|shithole]] to find your inner homosexual from the Rennaisance period. The turd you play as is the utmost definition of [[Guido]]. He bangs a chick and goes home to spam /b/ with goddamn [[so cash]] memes. Later his family is killed in front of his very eyes and yet he doesn't give a shit. He apparently thinks it's a good idea to sit back and watch [[Sup|the game]] while his family is butthurt by Fat Albert. Meanwhile in the copypasta factory, he finds his dad's Assassin outfit. Too bad it's same shit, new cape. 


==Characters==

'''FUN FACT''': Did you know real life assassins toked weed before every mission? It's goddamn true!

'''Desmond Miles''': Descendant of Altair and Ezio. Due to heavy interracial breeding he is mostly [[Jewish]] now. Works as a bartender but is kidnapped by a corporation, who want to use him as a guinea pig and use a new invention on him known as the '''Animal Anus''' which can supposedly [[mindfuck|bring back memories from the users ancestors]]. Once said memories have been received, Desmond is almost killed by the people who kidnapped him, but through a [[Deus Ex|deus ex machina]] is rescued by a mysterious woman. Why she was outside of the kitchen is beyond me. Truly, this is a very realistic game.

'''Alta√Ør Ibn La-Ahad''': Dirty [[Arab]] from 1191 whose main purpose is to pickpocket and kill people. In typical [[Arab]] fashion, he loves to pick fights with people on the street just for [[I did it for the lulz|shits and giggles]]. He also enjoys having heartfelt discussions with his assassination targets after slicing their necks, and the guards are polite enough not to interrupt these chats.  He's the only cool protagonist of the series. Note the two dots above the letter 'i' in his name. Bastard thinks he's better then the rest of us. Fucking Arabs. It should also be noted that thanks to the [[lolwut|Americanization of Eastern civilization]], Altair has an American accent.

'''Ezio Auditore da Firenze''': Say it nine times fast. A winner is you. Gay faggot guido from 1480. No matter where this asshole goes, he's always getting some boon. How does he do it!? Is it the fagstain he has on his lip? Only time will tell. His gay lover is Leonardo da Vinci, whom he shares passionate stares with every cutscene. Then there's the [[faggotry|touching]]. Always the touching, patting, whatever you may call it. It's gay and needs to stop. Every male character in the game has at least one spank or indirect hug from Ezio. Speaking of faggot, he can't seem to remember his uncle's name, which turns out to be [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFceNEL9Kik quite-a-surprise]. Ezio has a shitty cape. Oh yeah, and he has TWO dicks instead of one. Could you imagine?

'''Abstergo Industries''': (Pronounced "Asperger's Industries") [[Disney|Evil corporation]] that kidnapped Desmond. Serve as the main antagonist of the game. Their agenda is using the Animal Anus to find the location of Altair's [[Jew gold]], which he buried somewhere in the heart of Israel. Deserve to be burned at the stake due to the fact that a [[woman]] was able to outsmart them and ruin their plans.

'''Lucy Stillman''': Deserves no place in this game and really should stick to making [[sammich]]es rather then rescuing Jews from death. Notice the complete difference from the first and second game's appearance.

'''Rebecca Crane''': I don't know why the producers think it's a good idea to keep adding more female assassins. This woman is also better off in a kitchen somewhere, making baby back ribs for me and the guys. Mmm.

==Gameplay==
The game borrows gameplay elements heavily from other games/franchises. These include ''[[Spider-Man]]'' (scaling walls and buildings), ''[[Street Fighter]]'' (picking random fights with people on the street), ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' (committing crimes and running from the police) and several others. The gameplay is also horribly repetitive, as 90% of the time you will just be tapping the x button to beat up a dirty [[Muslim]] who tried to steal your Jew gold. 

The weapons at your disposal, which you may use to cut or jab through the guards' mysteriously ineffective body armor, include: 
*A sword
*A [[Wolverine|knife attached to your hand]] 
*Throwing knives
*A wrist mounted [[gun]] (I shit you not)
*Your hands

For some strange reason your legs are rendered useless when fighting, despite being heavily relied on throughout the rest of the game. Should you choose to become a [[Criminal Scum|criminal scum]], guards will attempt to kill you rather than confiscate your stolen goods. Should you ever be [[zerg rush]]ed by a group of guards you can simply pick one of them up and throw them into the rest and make a daring escape, or, just kill them all by picking out a person and countering everything he does; it's seriously not that fucking hard. Almost anything can act as a hiding spot, including the park bench. Truly, these are the cleverest [[bot|AI]] controlled bots, seeing as how you are the only one dressed in a fucking Assassin's uniform, it must be impossible to find you (though in their defense, their uniforms were designed so that they might be mistaken for heavily armed, building-scaling monks).

If you get damaged by an enemy an unrealistic amount of blood will spray out of your body in a similar fashion to [[ejaculation]]. Not even GTA has this much bloodspray. This can happen 5-6 more times before you eventually run out of blood, and return back to the Animal Anus' lobby. Also, in the same way as earlier GTA games, you don't have the ability to swim. Something Ubisoft, the lazy bastards, first fixed in the sequel.

==Sequel==
A sequel was confirmed by [[Ubisoft]], whereby you play as a [[Guido]] rather then an Arab/Jew. It's a slight improvement from it's predecessor, but Italians have no place in higher society, just as Arabs and Jews have no place in society at all. In this new one, you get to chillax with Dee Vinchee  and fly around on his MAGICAL FUCKING BIRDWINGS or some shit. Also other Guido stuff like sing showtunes on shit boats and jizza on pizza.

'''Assassin's Creed 2 Characters'''

'''[[guido|Ezio Auditore Da Firenze]]''' - You start off as this guido in the beginning of the game, Sliding out of his mother's snatch like a slip 'n slide. Hitting the wooden floor. His father picking him up and chanting italian gibberish. You suffer from a seizure and start crying. Years later, You are a rich nigger in a bitch gang. Sayin' yo momma jokes and being an Al Pacino rip off. You get a rock thrown at you and your repressed brain damage comes back. Causing your eyes to bulge from the sockets and foam at the mouth while flailing your arms towards your enemies.
