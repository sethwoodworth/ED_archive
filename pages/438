Analogy
An Analogy, by definition is to assist someone in [[lol_wut|understanding]] an [[furry|unknown object]] by comparing it to a [[buy_a_dog|well known]] or universal symbol. Such as to compare [[Goatse]] and [[Your Mom]] for gaping assholes. It has nothing to do with [[Ted Stevens|tubes or pipes.]]

==[[TL;DR|How to tell you have an analogy]]==
It is sometimes difficult to diagnose exactly what an analogy is. Sometimes you will be [[retard|confused]] as to whether you have a simple comparison, or an actual analogy. When Sammy Stephens claims that [http://youtube.com/watch?v=FJ3oHpup-pk Flea Market Montgomery] is just like a mini-mall, it's not an analogy because he's not trying to explain the unique properties of his store. Rather, he is comparing and even equating his store to other types retail outlets.

Now, an analogy would be to say that an [[Trey Burba|airsoft gun]] is like a [[Tyler Peterson|real gun]], except that it shoots plastic pellets instead of [[death|lead bullets]] like a [[gun]] should. Kinda like how your mom [[lesbian|sucks]] [[boobs|tits]], unlike the [[delicious cock]] she was intended. Or how [[My Chemical Romance]] is about as hard as your flaccid peen, unlike, say, Slayer, who made a profession out of beheading [[you]] and [[faggot|fans]] like you.

==Analogies and your education==
Despite all the controversy surrounding the English language and the fails it generates, analogies are not as complex as you might think. In fact, [[Miss Teen South Carolina|most U.S. schools]] teach Analogies in about the third or fourth grade, as making comparisons should be (and are) that simple. If you went to college in hopes of learning about analogies, go ahead and do the [[An Hero]]

==Analogies, Internets, and YOU!==
So what does this senseless faggotry have to do with you, or much less, the Internet on a whole? Well, aside from discussing how much [[Soul Calibur|Voldo]] looks like [[Firefly|Scorpius]] looks like [[Star Trek|A Borg]] looks like [[GIF|Robocop]] who acted in ''[[fail|Above the Clouds]]'' which is exactly where ''[[Adult Swim|Cowboy Bebop]]'' takes place, which is made by the same guy who did ''[[anime|Samurai Champloo]]'' which is like ''[[Inuyasha]]'', but [[over 9000]] times less gay than ''[[Outlaw Star]]''.

Also, in the great laws of the internets, all reposts are a repost of a repost. Meaning that all [[video game]] characters [[Mary Sue|look just like]] [[celebrities]] from the [[at least 100 years ago|Seventies and Eighties]].

((Images to come, folks.))
