'''Userbars''' are [[srsly|seriously]] [[lame|awesome]]. [[You]] should put <s>[[at least 100]]</s> [[over 9000]] userbars on your [[MySpace]] page, or you will never be [[gay|cool]].

==Purpose==
Userbars allow people to express minute, [[Boring|exciting]] aspects of their [[Dying Alone|rich and fulfilling]] lives to [[Noone|general audience]]. If you think that somebody is interested in the fact that you play [[Doom 3]], then you are, most certainly, a [[mega ultra super genius]]. 
Userbars are also a great way to fill up your signature on forums when you have nothing worth saying, nobody wants to know about your cat so they want to know about your [[Intel]], QUAD-SLI [[PC]]... right?

==Proper netiquette==
It is considered polite to make everyone know that Wikipedia rules, and on all [[forum]]s you frequent too, so people can [[troll|admire your fine person]].

==Animooted==
Can't fit all your favorite userbars into your forum signature? Fear not, for you can use [[Shit nobody cares about|ingenious software]] to make one animated userbar out of thousands of others. The new era of annoyance has begun!
