'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=South_Ossetia South Ossetia]''' is a region in [[Georgia]] which has recently seen a shitstorm of [[drama]] and [[lulz]] in the international community due to an outbreak of [[war]]. The war started [[last Thursday]] when Georgia started getting [[butthurt]] about black person separatists in the countries of [[shit nobody cares about|Abkhazia]] and South Ossetia, who have more ties to [[Russia]] than the former [[In Soviet Russia...|Soviet]] republic of [[Georgia, USA|Georgia]] which they are technically still part of. These [[gypsy|separatists]] thought that if the [[USA]], NATO and the EU could recognize [[Kosovo]], then why not them? But since Georgia and the Western coalition are [[buttsecks|bum buddies]], that'll never happen, although Russia wants these regions to get [[Communism|freedom]]. Despite this, at a recent NATO meeting in [[Romania|Bucharest]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] opposed Georgia's [[Wikipedia|request for adminship]], not allowing Georgia to have [[sysop|higher powers]] as a full member of NATO, so Georgia remained [[loser|autoconfirmed]] as the meeting ended in [[anti-lulz|no consensus]].

The war began just as the [[LOLympic_Games|Olympics]] started (by no coincidence), timed nicely by the Georgians as [[Vladimir Putin]] left his [[pederasty|altar boy]] Dmitry Medvedev in charge of the country. Most of [[Europe]] responded by sucking up to the USA and calling for a [[anti-lulz|ceasefire]], although Russia's staunch allies like [[Borat|Kazakhstan]] and [[Armenia]] backed up Russia's claims that Georgia was attacking Russian peacekeepers and that Georgia is the country that deserves to get [[pwned]] for attempting to fuck with the Russian [[bear]].

tl;dr - Soviet [[nigra]]s attacked Georgia to show they still [[pwn]] face at war and, that the [[Americunts]] and [[French]] should not mess with them WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE NOT DOING. Therefore WW3 will start resulting in epic lulz.



==Drama on the [[internets]]==
[[Image:Ossetia_hack.jpg|thumb|Gettin' [[Cyberrape|cyberrape]]d, image posted on site of Georgian parliament.]]
Most [[tabloid]] newspapers went crazy over this. The ignorant shitheads who read [[Rupert Murdoch|The Sun]] engaged in [[ad hominem]] attacks on the Russians despite not having a clue what the entire conflict is about.  This is  because they always believe that [[lie|everything that America ever does or backs up is the right thing]].  However, the [[communist]] sympathizers at The Guardian took a rather different stance. Whilst the Sun may claim that the [[batshit crazy]] [[pedophile]] Barry George killed British TV presenter [[whore|Jill Dando]], the [[Guardian]] tends to instead promote the [[JEWS DID WTC|conspiracy theory]] that she was killed by [[Serbia]]n secret agents for promoting the cause and [[baw|plight]] of Kosovo [[Albania]]ns at least [[10]] years ago on her shitty [[television]] show.  The Guardian still gets pro-[[Bush]] supporters to write [[article]]s for it in its comment is free section.

[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/georgia.nato This pro-US, pro-Israel sycophantic yes man] got a [[attack|verbal thrashing]] by extreme left-wing radicals, keen for [[cultural appropriation]] of Russia and its [[vodka|interests]], producing some lulzy quotes.

== Waking Up The Sleeping Bear ==

For now, it looks like the fucktarded Western coalition should have listened to Russia when it said that there would be [[serious business]] if Kosovo was considered independent. However, since most of Europe (except [[Spain]]) didn't have the [[balls]] to oppose Kosovo's independence, despite it blatantly breaking international [[law]], the world is going to have to suffer the consequences of [[over 9000]] secessionist movements like this in the future.  But due to mutually assured destruction, neither side will actually start World War Three, right?  Right? Not only this, but the little shithead georgians obviously only wanted to nut themselves once they had expanded their limp dick country.  Russia wanted said areas to gain autonomy, but this is obviously a ploy by vlad the impaler to take the territories for himself. (Note: the Russians gained the Crimean Khanate autonomy from the turkadurks in the 1700s, only to annex it for themselves in a lulzy move seven years later.)

'''4 August 2008''' - Georgia sends troops into the state of South Ossetia to fight Russian-backed rebels and Ossetian separatists,  who have been running a de facto independent state for a few years.

[[tl;dr]] - Georgia starts shit.

'''5 August 2008''' - Russia tells Georgia that if dey fuck with Ossetia, shit be on! 

[[tl;dr]] - Russia accepts Georgia's shit, only to throw it back in Saakashvili's face, cause Russians don't take shit from anyone.

== The Men in Charge ==

Russian Macho: In 1999 Putin came to power in Russia, couped the corrupt mafia government and actually did good things: he doubled the average Russian’s income, which tripled the standard of living. He gave back pride to the Youth, secretly hoping they’ll enlist in the FSB. He even anointed Medvedev as president, just cause the dude had a cool last name. ("Medved" means "bear" in Russian, and "-ev" is just a common ending for a lastname.) Being a true leader, Putin also did some questionably good things: he served up lovely Polonium to all those seeking to destabilize Russia, he offered Chechens incentives to stay with Russia, and bombed the shit out of those that refused, and he let the Russian Army win the Second Chechen War by ensuring that Kremlin cronies won’t interfere. He even did some dastardly things, like ignoring the investigations of journalists who were killed; Russia’s big, too much stuff to do, don’t have time to investigate journo-deaths. Sowwy. But not really. 

Georgian "Macho": In 2004 Saakashvili came to power in Georgia, established a corrupt mafia government, whacked one of his opponents, Pakriashvili, and, as is natural to leaders who admire Dzhugashvili, (better known as Stalin,) purged the army. He tried to assault Ossetia in 2004, but failed since they were facing Russian-trained Ossetians and Cossacks fresh from the Motherland. A Wikipedo created [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_South_Ossetia_clashes an article on it], so you can see a full description of how that skirmish went. After the failure, Saakashvili was influenced by the Neocons, whose motto is: "if you fail, get bigger guns and invade, invade, invade!" Between 2004 and August 2008, Saakashvili bought tanks, guns, modern fighting equipment, and spent more of his per capita GDP on the army, than any other leader. Woot! For instance his tank force went from 31 T-72s to 191 T-72s. But since you are an ED reader, <s>I won’t bore you with anymore facts.</s> Already bored.

== The South Ossetian campaign tl;dr==

On August 7th Saakashvili launched an all out attack on Ossetia, called “Operation Clear Field”. His plan was to annihilate all Ossetians living in the area assigned by Stalin to Georgia, and infiltrate it with “Ossetians” who would shout against the evil Russian aggression, proclaim Saakashvili a Deity and beg for union with Georgia. (Protip for wannabe conquerors: when attempting Ethnic Cleansing and later attempting the cover-up, do not title it “Operation Clear Field”. It’s very bad PR.) Saakashvili’s three pronged attack failed at Roki, succeeded against the JPKF base, and ended in a stalemate in Tskhinvali. The latter would become a bitter battle over the next three days, and the only battle of the war that lasted over 12 hours. 

The battle started when the Georgians shelled Tskhinvali with cluster munitions and bombed it from the air. Most of the city was destroyed, but few civilian casualties were recorded, as most intelligent Ossetians fled to the safety of the Red Army. Concerned that they were not killing enough people, the Georgians told the people to flee on the only road that was still working, into Russia, but then they shot up that road. A lot of the smart Ossetians who were fleeing towards Russia and escaped death in Tskhinvali died on that road, and then the Georgians sent in their tanks to crush up cars with desperate people and screaming families. The Georgian Air Force used its American-made helicopters to fire rockets into little straw huts where poor Ossetians lived Africa-style, then sent brave Georgian warriors into the villages to finish off survivors. 

The Georgians made their biggest mistake of the war when they killed 15 Russian peacekeeping soldiers by shelling their base. They also destroyed 2 Russain tanks and a couple of trucks. But Russians captured 44 Georgian tanks, so they didn't really care about losing two. 

The Gerogians then went through the city with tanks and APCs like Rambo wannabes, shooting at the buildings and cars and anyone they saw while screaming WAHOO! Meanwhile, elite Georgian commandos were carrying out a special mission: redirecting all of the city's waterpipes to pump hundreds of gallons of water into tightly cramped basements where dozens of civilians were hiding. Georgian commanders later claimed that they were trying to help out the people and give them something to drink while hiding, and it was not their fault if they were all shittly swimmers. Meanwhile, Georgians villagers living South Ossetia who had been secretly given AK-47's by the Georgian government got their orders, and killed their Ossetan neighbors and friends in order to make room for new, ethnically pure neighbors and friends. The Ossetian militia, aided by Russian Peacekeeping units and lightly armed, sprung into action destroying 4 Georgian T-72 tanks and killing at least 10 highly equipped and NATO/SPRI-trained Georgians. They also shot down a Georgian SU-25 jet and slaughtered its crew. The Georgians were killing dozens of the Ossetian militia, and destroyed 5 Russian-made Ossetian tanks, since they were driven by peasants who could barely drive a car. The Georgians were having a high old time, stealing shit from Ossetian corpses and the ruined city, and taking cell phone pictures of their atrocities to show their families what big men they were, until the Red Air Force joined in on the fun and began bombing Georgian troops and artillery positions, killing lots of Failiorgians and smashing a lot of their advanced military shit to scrap metal. 

The Georgians had a brilliant plan: they wanted to blow up the Roki Tunnel, thinking that the Russians would not be guarding it with SpetzNaz. The Georgians sent in SPRI-trained commandos, which ran into SpetzNaz. A massive raep ensued. The SpetzNaz lost 1 soldier, the 200+ Georgian special unit was completely wiped out, not one survivor. What kind of an idiot would send soldiers trained and armed by mercenaries against the SpetzNaz? Oh right, the planners of this war. 

Russian ground forces began arriving through the Roki Tunnel, ensuring the fail of the Georgian attack. SPRI-trained Georgian Special Forces ambushed the Russian advance column. Some Russian soldiers got killed or wounded, but their general, who was the Georgians main target, got away with a leg scratch. But then again, the Russian Army is bigger than Georgia's population, so no Russian commander really gave a rat's ass. On the other hand, the entire Georgian ambush party got wiped out. The Georgians tried counterattacking several times, but the Russians beat them back with [[fail|heavy losses]] (A mild way of saying absolute pwnage).

Meanwhile, the [[Nazi|Georgian government]] began whining to the world about being the victim, and [[sarcasm|constantly whining about how Russia was invading a smaller country to try to bring it under control]].

Having the World's most manueverable army, Russia was successfully conducting a flanking manuever, when one of its vechicles, BMD-1, carrying five Air Desantniks, broke down. Another vehicle stayed behind to tow it. Meanwhile a Georgian engineering company was conducting a "rapid retreat" and ran into the Desantniks. Despite being outnumbered, 50 to 10, the Desantniks pinned the MPRI trained Georgians in a building, and kept them there until the arrival of the Russian tanks, which then destroyed the entire building. Georgian casualties: 17 dead, 33 captured. Russian casualties: well, erm, one of the suits was dirty, and had to be dry cleaned, that counts, right?
 
A Georgian tank unit tried to out-maneuver the most maneuverable army in the world, and hit the Russians in the flank as they were pouring into South Ossetia. Too bad for them, the Russians already had some artillery set up. As a result, the Russian gunners blasted the Failiorgian tanks to scrap metal and the crews to charred shashlik, then the Russians counterattacked and wiped out whatever was left. 

Soon, moar Russians began arriving, including artilley and armor, but the NATO-trained Georgians actually tried to put up a fight, and heavy street fighting ensued. Being skilled at city street fighting from the Chechen experience, Russian soldiers had no trouble slaughtering the Georgians NATO-trained toy soldiers. Ossetian militia joined in on the fun and wiped out the Georgians inside captured Ossetian villages, losing a couple of guys in the process. 

Russian tanks easily blasted the less-advanced Georgian T-72 tanks, while Ossetian militia also got some with RPGs and molotov cocktails, frying the tank crews to a deep crisp. Some Georgian crews even ran out of their own tanks at night in a panic. The Failiorgians abandoned 44 of their own tanks, wich the Russians captured and towed back to the motherland. 

Meanwhile, the Russian Air Force was having a glorious time bombing up Georgian territory. They killed some soldiers and hit military bases, but the Georgians had put all their military bases in or near civilian areas just to make an emeny look bad by killing inncents. They succeeded, as the Russians bombed anything within half a mile from a military base, and 200 civilians died and lots of infrastructure was smashed. President Sukashvili did not let his government help civilians. He preferred to simply tape civvie suffering, because he wanted moar sympathy from the Amerofags. Hoping to claim a victory anywhere, Failorgians claimed that they shot down [[over 9000]] Russian planes. However, after a complete analysis of the situation, the only "air victory" that the Failorgians scored, was shooting down an improperly used Russian T-22M bomber, which for reasons unknown to all sane people, decided to descend to a lower altitude, which is akin to dancing in a minefield. The TU-22M was shot down because it descended from an altitude of 16 kilometers, to an altitutde of 4 kilometers. Five of the Russian crewmen were killed in the crash, and the only survivor got captured and thrown in a Georgian [[prison|comfort box]]. Even then, out of four flying targets, the Failorgians only hit one plane. The MiG-29s did not make a single mistake. In short, Russian planes outperformed all other planes in combat, while working against a modern, NATO-Radar system. For every Russian pilot killed, 10 got actual combat experience. Two other SU-25s and a SU-24 were shot down by Georgian AA, and 3 Russian SU-25s were accidentally shot down by their own AA. Four of the Russian pilots were taken prisoner. They were then tortured to the point where they had to be hospitalized, then the Failiorgian said that they had been wounded, and showed the world press what good care it was taking of them, all for PR. In a lulzy and forced interview, the Russkie pilots said that they were [[bullshit|getting better treatment than they would have in Russia]]. Two Russian SU-25 and SU-24 jets took Georgian stinger hits and still flew. Despite Russians flying over 1,000 air sorties, the only kills the Georgians got was due to Russian mistakes, making the so-called NATO-intergrated Georgian anti-air defense, the failingest ever. 

The Georgian Air Force also tried to join in on the fun by bombing up Russian columns coming through the Roki Tunnel. They killed or wounded a couple dozen Russians, destroyed some APCs, but they didn't stop the Russkie advance.

Nevertheless, the Russians were not happy, so Russian bombers destroyed half of the Failorgian Air Force - ''on the ground''. And by the way, half the Georgian Air Force was ''seven'' planes. Some American-trained Georgian combat pilots died in that airstrike. How does one country fail so hard? 

The Russians continued to clear Georgian forces out of Tskhinvali. The Georgians wwere losing dozens of casualties every hour, and Russian airstrikes and artillery blasted a lot of the Georgian artillery and killed some crews, forcing Georgian artillery forces to retreat to prevent absolute pwnage. So now, with all their atrty gone along with half their air force, the Russians were free to bomb and shell Georgian positions at will, and keep it up until every last Failiorgian was a rotting corpse. Among the bodies found were black men in NATO uniforms. Since there are [[no niggers]] in Georgia, they obviously were Amerofag instructors training the Georgians on how to properly enforce America's imperial interests (IE [[impossible|beat the Russian Army]]).

The Failiorgians realized that they were in deep shit, so they retreated from South Ossetia, but then regrouped and tried to push back in and this time, they ''almost'' won. Their sneak attack was a total surprise, as the Russians did not think they would actually come back for moar after the asskicking they had received. Thanks to surprise, they killed a couple Russian soldiers and a lot of Ossetians by starting out with a sneak artillery rockets attack, and were overjoyed when they saw the Russians falling back. In reality, the Russians were performing a tactical retreat, in a virtually abandoned city, planning a perfect, large scale ambush.  The Georgians now thought it was their turn. They thought that they managed to push the Russians and Ossetians to the outskirts of Tskhinvali, until the Russians and Ossetians counterattacked with fresh Russian reinforcements from the Roki Tunnel, ensuing full scale slaughter of the Georgians, and a major embarrassment for NATO/SPRI, causing their stocks to plummet. The Georgians managed to put up a good fight at the village of [[Moonspeak|Zemo-Nikosi]]. The small Georgian garrison in there killed some Russians and Ossetians and held the Reds back, until the Russians brought in tanks and artillery, slaughtering most of the Georgians and taking the survivors prisoner. Another major fail for Saakashvili's toy soldiers.

The Georgians then retreated, and thentried to push into Tskhinvali one last time. This time, they were immediately met by a Russian  counterattack with some Ossetian help, resulting in another massacre of Georgians. Georgian commanders described the Russian counterattack as "something from hell". Well, don't mess with stuff that Russia cares about, and you won't be in hell.

== The Abkhaz Campaign: A Very Brief Description ==

While the Georgians were getting raeped in Ossetia, the fellow breakaway Republic of Abkhazia honored its defense treaty with Ossetia, and launched an all out assault in Kodori Valley. One Abkhaz soldier was killed, and two others wounded, but they managed to kill two NATO-trained Georgian soldiers. The following conversation ensued: 

Russians: "Why are you fucking attacking without massive artillery support when we have it?" 

Abkhaz: "Oh come on, it's Failorgians!" 

Russians: "Oh yeah? How many casualties you guys have?" 

Abkhaz: "Two wounded one dead. Can we continue?" 

Russians: "Damn, they are lolcows. However we need to test out our artillery system, withdraw your men!" 

After a massive Russian artillery bombardment, and airstrikes against Kodori Valley, the 2,500 man Georgian contingent was pulverized, and only a battalion of 900 soldiers who didn't have any civilian clothes to hide in survived. Meanwhile, the conversation continued: 

Russians: "Ok, now have fun!" 

Abkhaz: "You bastards stole all the fun!" 

The Abkhaz proceeded to sweep the "special forces" from the Kodori Valley, losing 6 more wounded. Meanwhile over 6,000 Russians who have not seen any combat action decided to go into Georgia and pay a visit to [[Potty|Poti]], [[Kobidobidog|Khobi]], [[P Diddy|Zugdidi]] and [[Weeaboo|Senaki]], destroying military bases. The local Georgian leaders quickly promised not to resist, meaning that the Russians could basically have a field day. The Russian navy blockaded Georgia, but the Georgian navy and coast guard thought they could challenge it, so they sent out a few boats to attack the Russians. One of the boats fired a missile, causing a little bit of damage and starting a small fire on a Russian ship. The Russians then launched another missile, blowing the Failiorgian boat to bits and killing all of its crewmen. The rest of the boats got the message, and sailed away like the French Navy. The Failiorgian navy then sailed away to the city of Bat'umi, and the ships that were left behind were blown up by the Russians, causing a neutral observer to remark: "what a clumsy Russian Bear, sank most of the Failorgian Navy, should've given it to the Abkhaz instead". Why the Failorgians didn't move those ships after a massive epic fail in Kodori, remains a mystery. The fighting was the "highest casualty ratio since the 1800's" a Russian commander remarked, remembering the good times, before his birth. 

The remaining 900 Georgians "retreated in haste" from the Kodori Valley. Failorgians don't like discussing the Battle of Kodori Valley much. 

On top of everything, the Russians in Poti seized US Jeeps, equipped with the latest electronic war gadgets. Other loot from Poti included NATO and Israeli War Manuals, complete training exercises, a list of weapons and how to use them; overall the guides are superbly detailed. "Christmas came early" - a Russian soldier remarked. "The minute Ukraine/Georgia get into NATO, these get published" a senior Russian secret service agent grinned, leaving poor Yushenko to Bawww on the street. Suckashvili was dealing with the ass-raep his country was receiving at the moment, chewing his tie, and was just plain too busy to bawww with Yushenko.

== Georgian retreat == 

On 11 August, The Georgians finally realized that they were neck deep in [[shit]], and adopted the classic French military strategy by retreating like [[faggots]], and hoping Russia decides to not raep them any more than they [[goatse|already have]].

The Russians decided they hadn't even begun to raep and began bombing the shit out of everything; a port, some Gypsies in a apartment and some [[moar]] airfields. Meanwhile, in South Georgia, the U.S. gathered their soldiers that were training the Georgians, as well as all the other shit they had, and [[GTFO|made a strategic retreat]]. The Russians then [[I Am In Your Base Killing Your D00ds|started dismantling]] any Georgian military equipment they could find and even stole some US hummers that the Americunts forgot to bring with them. Too bad the Failorgians took most of their equipment and vehicles with them, so that they could preserve what little honor they had left.

[[shit nobody cares about|It's important to remember]] that the USA is [[serious business|very messed up in this shit]]. Georgia let the US [[rape|train]] their armed forces, and in return they sent [[over 9000|over 2000]] troops to Iraq. Georgia is whining about how [[nobody cares]] about them and isn't sending help, and to combat the bawwwwwing, [[W|George Bush]] said that the attack was "unacceptable" and told Russia to "[[NO U|reverse it's course]]", which [[lie|fixed everything]].

'''Old MiG-29 in da main action'''
<center>{{frame|<youtube>eb6hqzR7tns</youtube>|color=#D8CACA}}</center>

By the end of the day, [[All Your Base Are Belong To Us|all of the Georgian airspace, waters, and Ossetia ARE BELONG TO RUSSIA]]. Russia continued [[rape|raeping]] the Georgians with air strikes around the raep clock, invading the fuck out of Ossetia, taking over the Georgian [[niggerdick|Black Sea]], and prepared to invade from Abkhazia, completely fucking up the Georgians.

In the Black Sea, the Ukraine said that all Russian ships that leave the Russian ports in the Ukraine are going to be [[ban set|b&]] from the Ukrainian waters until the Georgians get raeped hard enough to surrender.

The Russians were pouring into Ossetia faster then Albanians into Kosovo, and were about to invade the fuck out West Georgia. This resulted in a bunch of West Georgians getting scared and moving with their auntie and uncle in [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air|Bel-Air]]...

== Meanwhile, in Abkhazia...==

'''11 August 2008''' -  Abkhazia decided that it had been [[Friend Zone|left out]] of the drama and lulz long enough. It decided to let Russian troops [[gangbang|enter it]], and the Russians threatened to go into Georgia again, thus doubling the pwnage. Abkhazia also [[hacker|stole source code]] from geocities and made this [[leet|l33t]] [http://www.abkhazia.org/ website].


'''Do you smell that KOROVAN?'''
<center>{{frame|<youtube>L8X6I3Dk3Zs</youtube>|color=#D8CACA}}</center>


Other than that, the Abkhazian soldiers began the quest for lulz as they engaged the [[shit|Georgian]] [[retarded|Special]] Forces. Georgians gathered in Tblisi and chanted "meek hile, meek hile!" (moar liek 'Sieg heil', [[amirite]]?), begging for president [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] to stop acting like a faggot and actually do something.




== [[Anti-lulz]] & [[Faggotry]] in Tbilisi ==

[[Image:Lolwutrussia.jpg|thumb|Mikhail having the French speak for him, just to fag everything up.]]
[[File:Saakaskvilicowers.jpg|thumb|Mikhail is scared of the Russian Air Force]]

The Russians had moar fun by bombing up Tblisi's airport, and then some shit on the outskirts. Ordinary people were buying up all kinds of shit and were worried about their assholes due to the massive raep the Russians crave. Meanwhile, Mikhail paid a visit to Gori, when a Russkie jet flew overhead. He then panicked and ran away right in front of news cameras.

'''12 August 2008''' - As if Mikhail couldn't fag everything up a bit more, he had the French--the fucking ''French'', the fucking failingest, most [[gay]] military in the entire world--get the Russians to sign a [[fail|cease-fire]] while [[over_9000|150,000]] Georgians, Azeris, Turks, Gypsies, and some Ukrainians had a massive ghey orgy while cumming to their [[fag|President]] speaking about how they have [[lie|stopped the fighting between Russia and Georgia]] for the time being. 

Because it was covered in cum and French faggotry, the Russians threw it out the window 10 hours later. They, along with Ossetian militia, crossed the South Ossetia-Georgia border [[Surprise sex|into Georgia]] and began to party down back in the city of [[gore|Gori]], Georiga.

== It's a Communist Party in Gori ==
'''13 August 2008''' - Looks liek they were reloading teh Soviet ræp.

[[OVER 9000]] Russian Red Army tanks which, [[BTW]], were borrowed by the South Ossetian military ([[some argue|which]], if you can recall, Mikhail [[fact|said was a]] [[lie]]. <b>Turned out to be the Russkies all along!</b>) set up a base of raep in Gori. They planned to show that faggot Mikhail that the Russian Red Army can easily raep them, АНД ТНАТ УЮѴ АЯЕ НЕВЕЯ ЭВЕЯ АЛЛОѴѴЕД ТО ФУСК ѴѴІТН ТНЕ МОТНЕРЛАНД ѴѴІТНОУT ГЕТТІНГ THОЯОУГЛЫ ЯЭРЬД БАЙ ТНЕ ЯЕД БЭАЯ. РОДИНА-МАТЬ!

The Failiorgian Army had regrouped in Gori after the devastating assraep it received in South Ossetian and Abkhazia. They had taken up defensive positions in the city, and had placed their heavy artillery close by to provide support. But when they heard that the Russians were coming their way, they piled into tanks, trucks, APCs, and even civilian cars, and retreated as fast as they could. They took most of their military gear with them, and what they couldn't take they left behind, including over a ''quarter'' of their advanced artillery guns. They even had most of the civvies leave. Meanwhile, the Russians entered Gori And finding it devoid of Georgians, they [[party hard|partied hard]], slaughtered who ever was left, looted some shit, blocked off all the roads, and then partied harder. Imagine the best party you've ever been to. Then imagine everyone there having their own bottle of vodka, an AK-74 with several clips of silver bullets, and instead of Honda Civics and hand-me-down Mercedes, people showed up in the crisp, camo-painted main attack T-72 tanks parked up and down the street. It's the kind of combat U.S. armed forces desperately wish they could engage in...you know, revenge on a full scale, and really just fucking some weird ethnic minorities shit up while copping loot, wenches and engaging in free for all goatse along the way. Ha ha, well, that's kinda like our invasion of Iraq but unlike Russian special forces, we can't shoot journalists and bludgeon them with rifle butts if they happen to record instances of wrongdoing. That's what Blackwater is for! 

The U.S. seems to be bound by pesky things like "international law" and "recognition of human rights" which are subjects conspicuously missing from Russian military field manuals. Because we invade on false pretenses, we have to uphold hold some sort of global image of "leading the way" in terms of warfare conduct, we basically cut ourselves out of all the cool shit that war is for.

In Gori, the Russians raked civilian apartment complexes with heavy machine guns, stole all of the military the Georgians left behind, salted fields, and impregnated Georgian vag in between lighting huts on fire with zippos and the like. Why do you think all those Russian troops are grinning like devious bastards in all the associated press photos? You would be too if you just got to use that glistening tank-mounted heavy machine gun on a marketplace full of children while you calmly sit in the hatch and pat the looted 72" Sony plasma t.v. loaded next to you, knowing that's going up on your apartment wall back in Russia. The best part as when they stole all of the cool-ass NATO military equipment that the Georgians left behind during their retreat, and declared that it ALL BELONG TO RUSSIA, taking it to Moscow to be put on display. 

The Russians found some military bases teeming with loot that the Georgians had left behind. After taking whatever weapons and equipment they could find, they then took literally ''everything'' that they possibly could, even the toilets. The military bases continued to be looted until they had just empty rooms, all portraits of Saakashvili were defaced, and then the Russians totally smashed them, until they were almost totally destroyed.

The Russian black person Sea fleet and the Abkhazians prepared to re-invade the fuck out of west Georgia, while the good old U.S. of A. planned how to not do a damn thing but talk shit. Again, the whole "rape and pillage" envy thing.

Apparently the Russians--tired from all the looting, partying hard, and raep in Gori, began heading for Tbilisi with some tanks, and [[at least 100]] APC's and trucks to fuck up the Gregorian army [[for the lulz]] (or at least that's what [[LNN|CNN]] and [[Mikhail Saakashvili|Mikhail]] are saying). They were well on their way and they're gonna have fun.

You may be asking ''"Where the fuck is the Failorgian Army now?"'' Well, if you ask they were running like the [[tl;dr|French ran from Krauts back in WWII]], running towards Tbilisi every time they see a Russian due to the amount of raep they have inflicted on the Georgians. They took most of their equipment and vehicles with them, but what they left behind was tempting enough to steal and take to Mother Russia.

[[Yes]] it's true, the Russians then began [[party hard|hauling ass]] down the main Georgian highway to fuck up the Georgians Stalingrad style, and everything in Georgia west of Gori [[all your base are belong to us|ARE BELONGED TO RUSSIA]]. This means at this point, the only the only major city left in the whole fucking country that hasn't been raepd to shit is Tbilisi. [[truth|So yeah, the Georgians were fucked]]. Their paramilitiaries from different Russian ethnic minorities and Ossetian militia went into Georgian villages meeting no resistance whatsoever, where they lined up all the men and slit their throats, dragged all the attractive women away to raep and eventually murder them, and forced the rest out of their homes before looting and then torching the villages. The women who survived to tell the tale to journalists were obviously very pissed off, as they were apparently not attractive.

With having raeped just about everything in the country, the Russians headed toward Tblisi in hopes of capturing that massive [[bitch]] Mikhail and giving him to [[Raptor Jesus|Putin]] to personally raep. They also planned to [[win|overthrow the massive faggotry that is the Georgian military]]. Saakashvili and his top cronies fled to Azerbaijan to save his ass from being [[butthurt]]. 

Mikhail continued to go on CNN '''live''' looking like a complete faggot, apparently attempting to spread his propaganda to the American masses in the vain hope that he could get NATO or the U.S. to keep the Russians from goatseing his ass. Since he was not a [[fag]], Putin preferred to "hang Saakashvili by the balls" instead.

== Back on the Highway to Hell==

'''14 August 2008''' - The Russians were still hauling ass along the only highway to Tbilisi, but now even the fucking [[muslims|Chechens]] are getting in on the action. The whole Red Army are going [[Viking]] on Georgia's asses; pillaging, partying hard, and raeping the fuck out of every thing of value they saw on their way to the capital of Failorgia. The Georgian army didn't do shit, due to all the fail, and instead employed classic French military tactics (ie; running like [[faggots]]).

Then the Russians realized not everyone in their army were getting medals for civilian kills, rape points, additional furlough for torching baby milk factories and the like so they sent in even moar armor and troops to take over Tbilisi, and the [[muslim|Chechens]] are taking all the shit they stole back to Chechnya to sell to Abkhazia for teh monies and [[Islam]]. After all, it's only fair to make sure even the lowliest Russian private can know the joys of lighting grain stores on fire ensuring starvation for thousands in the coming winter.

The Russians stopped here and there every once in a while to roast a good old Shashlik (Georgian-on-a-stick) to eat with copious amounts of vodka to fuel additional acts of pillage (fun). A few times they came across some non-pussy Georgians, but when that happened the Russians just raeped them in a minute, roasted them, ate them, and got back on their way. Meanwhile, the [[niggers|Ossetians]] stole all their equipment and headed back to Ossetia with their loot and bitching new Land Rovers which the Failiorgians forgot to take with them, to clean up all the Georgians the Russians missed. After mopping up, they again caught up with the Russians, stole all the military shit the Georgians didn't take with them and the Russians didn't destroy, headed back... and planned to repeat until Tbilisi falls.

Even though Gori [[all your base are belong to us|ALL ARE BELONGING TO RUSSIA]], the Russians decided that they didn't want it due to all the faggotry of Georgia, and the fact that there is no more loot to steal. Now they are simply abandoning it to back up the [[zerg rush]] in Tbilisi.

Meanwhile the Georgians were bawwwing that the Russians were bombing Gori when in actuality, all the Russians did was simply [[I Am In Your Base Killing Your D00ds|smash some military bases]]. The Georgians were still running their asses back to Tbilisi to keep the Russians from slamming their red cawk up Georgia's already bloody asshole.

After looting and fucking up Georgia's main Black Sea port in true Viking fashion, and sinking four out of nineteen boats of the Georgian Navy, the Russian [[zerg rush|Red Navy's People's Marine Corps]] were on their way to take over Georgia's second largest (and second-to-last city) that's not ALL BELONG TO RUSSIA with over 9,000 tanks to fuck up everything. [[Fox News|FAUX NEWS]] confirmed that over half of his country ARE BELONGS TO RUSSIA.

Anyway, it appeared that the Russians were doing exactly like the did in Poti, as they did in Gori, pillaging the shit out of everything and then heading on to the next biggest city to raep the fuck out of and PARTY HARD, but this time [[epic win|they are going all the way]].

Then the whole Georgian military headed to Tbilisi to keep the Russians from taking their last city and defend it [[Unrealistic Expectations|just like the Spartans did in Sparta]], but they were going to do it in the most faggy fashion [[EVAR]] and fail hard, due to the massive raep that the Russians hunger for.

In the meantime the Georgians did jack shit to keep the Russian Raep Machine from being IN THEIR COUNTRY, KILLIN [[their]] D00DS - all while Mikhail was boarding a flight down to Azerbaijan to keep himself from getting raeped hard personally by Putin.

Pissed that Russians stole all their [[porn|pr0nz]], [[cp]], and torrents in Gori, the Georgian Army retaliated by shooting at WESTERN REPORTERS on the territory Georgia still held, [[I did it for the lulz|for the lulz]] (and possibly also try to blame the Russians for it), since it's about the only thing the Georgians could do to get [[Unrealistic Expectations|America to save them]].

== The Withdrawal Method ==

[[Image:Bawwwww_bunny.jpg|thumb|The Russians made my asshole bleed!]]

'''15 August 2008''' - [[Mikhail Saakashvili|Saakashvili]], [[Incontinent Student Bodies|bawwwing]] from the massive amounts of raep given to him by the Russian Raep Machine, signs another cease-fire and begs like a bitch for Russia to sign it. Russia, having run out of things to raep, [[I did it for the lulz|signs it for the lulz]]. The Jewnited States immediately starts [[internet tough guy|talking all sorts of shit]], saying stuff that you'd expect to hear from a [[butthurt]] [[whore|ex-girlfriend]]...

Russia could care less about because it just [[cum|busted the biggest nut]] [[evar]] [[Bukkake|in the face of]] one of it's former territories, and also knows the US is already fighting two [[luser|losing]] wars and probably won't start a third.

== Wait for it... ==

While the [[fail|peace treaty]] was in [[lolwut|effect]], the Red army decided to have some fun, while the Georgians were cleaning their bloody assholes. 

They blew up another Georgian ship and took prisoner some 22 Georgian armyfags approaching them on top of that, and just to make the point that the U.S. can't do shit, the good old Russians stole a couple of bitching U.S.-made Georgian Army Humvees which the Georgians apparently couldn't afford and still have to pay for since their name is on the lease. Shit!

Meanwhile back in East Georgia, the Russian got within 25 miles of Tbilisi to piss off the Georgians even more, while they destroyed or stole all the Georgian shit, cut the throats of all the men and boys, and raeped all the attractive women. The Georgian Army sent a convoy of their "Special Forces" in pickup trucks, but then they panicked and ran when they actually got close.

The Russians moved towards the Georgian village of [[moonspeak|Lamiksana]], but the Georgian Police decided to stop them. How? By arranging their cars and pickups in a line to block the path of the Russians. The Russians then drove their tanks and APCs  right through the lines and smashed up the cars, just as the [[pigs|terrified cops]] ran away and didn't do shit. 

The Russians slowly began to [[Sex|pull out]] of Georgia, and the Georgian military went back heavily armed in their combat vehicles (the ones they actually took with them while retreating), but they only got close when they were SURE the big bad Russians were long gone. Then, the Georgian Police came back to the cities, while civilians returning found everything of value in their homes was gone.  

However, the Russians did not fully withdraw, as that would be bowing down to the Jewnited Nations. They built fighting positions [[Buttsex|inside Georgia]] near the South Ossetian and Abkhazian border that they called "buffer zones", set up two checkpoints near Gori, and two observer posts near Poti. When hundreds of Georgian soldiers in armored vehicles and pickup trucks came forward to reclaim territory, all it took was a few shells to send the vehicles driving away at full speed and [[Fags|frightened Georgian soldiers]] utilizing French tactics and running like hell. The Georgian Army did not aspire for another asskicking, so they kept their distance, but Georgian citizens were outraged, and hoped that their human chains and protests and demonstrations would convince the Russians to change their minds. The Georgians and the Amerofags couldn't do shit, but the Russians eventually tired of their little games, and after two months they dismantled their checkpoints, and pulled out of Georgia. The Georgian Army then rolled in with its surviving tanks and APCs to [[Internet Tough Guy|Protect the citizens against future Russian aggression]]. In the little Georgian town of [[Pervert|Perevi]], right across the South Ossetian border, the Russians sent in 500 troops, and the faggot Georgian police pulled out without firing a shot. The Russians kept a small garrison and two checkpoints inside the town, while the Georgian Army, which still had a lot of Western-supplied military equipment and vehicles, and thousands of soldiers, was scared to go even close to it for fear of poking the Bear. In October 2010, the Russians dismantled their checkpoints and withdrew all their forces back into South Ossetia. A Georgian Army unit then went into the town, held a victory parade, planted the Georgian flag, and took patriotic photos of the whole thing to show the Army "liberating" the last piece of Georgian territory.

== Losses ==

Georgia lost:

*3,144 soldiers dead (But the Failiorgians attempted to cover it up and said 215, then 162),
*1,964 soldiers [[bawwwww|wounded]]
*36 [[Police|cops]]
*228 civilians
*12 [[prison]]ers
*65 out of its 191 T-72 tanks and some other armored vehicles, some burned, some taken to Russia
*1,700+ [[gun|small arms]]
*Some of its NATO-made artillery and air defense and advanced targeting systems
*Some NATO war guides, packed lunches, and combat gear
*<s>Half of its Air Force</s>
*<s>Some of its Navy</s>
*'''Two branches''' of its military were raped so hard, that it took a full year to rebuild them to their former strength. Bawwwwww. 
*Its self-pride and dignity

Russia lost:

*67 soldiers dead
*5 pilots dead
*283 soldiers wounded
*2 tanks, but they gained 44, so who gives a shit about 2 tanks? 
*6 planes (3 of them from [[Fail|friendly fire]])
*12 prisoners

Also, don't forget the <s>365</s> 168 Ossetian civilians slaughtered in Tskhinvali by the Georgian [[Holocaust]]. <s>150</s> 84 Ossetian militiamen also died defending their homes and land, and an Abkhaz was also pwnt in Kodori.

Remember how NATO thought that its Georgian toy soldiers would stand up to the bear? How's that theory coming along now, Jew-slaves? As for you, Georgia, remember your [[Holocaust|Operation Clean Field]]? How'd that turn out for you? Not the big bad tough guy anymore, [[Canadia|eh]]? 

Moral of the Story: Don't fuck with the Russian Bear, for it assraepes those who fuck with it.

[[Image:Georgian_soilder.png|thumb|100px|The typical Georgian Solider]]

Unlike the Red Air Force losing only 5 airmen, the [[french|Franco]]-Americunt forces had a total of [http://128.121.102.226/aaloss.html seventeen] of their high end aircraft shot down during the first day of [[Iraq|Desert Storm]] (Ie:the "good war") by fifty year old sandnigger AA-guns. The supposedly [[fail|elite]] [[Europe|NATO]] trained and standardized Georgian air defense, couldn't even do a quarter of that even with the latest AA missiles.

== Akhbazia and South Ossetia are now countries... ==

Russia, tired of the U.S. and NATO spamming "GEORGIA'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, GEORGIA'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, GEORGIA'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY" after they recognized Kosovo in the same way while not giving a fuck about Russia declared that they now [[epic|recognize]] [[win|South Ossetia, and Abkhazia]], which means that Georgia failed hard in the end, and the Russians  just want the U.S. just to shut the fuck up with the spamming. As predicted, the U.S. increased its spamming, and bawwed for weeks on end, and as a "fuck you" to Russia, sent more weapons to Georgia.

Now even moar butthurt, Georgia announced that they were cutting their 2 inch diplomatic cock off from Russia, and now are taking the money they spend on the Georgian Embassy which is about enough to replace about 3 pick-ups. The Russia Ministry of International Fuck Yous said that, saying that the [[over 9000|600,000 to 1 million Georgians]] in Russia would be left to the [[holocaust|mercy of fate]], and there's now talks of setting up a Georgian Hunting season in South Ossetia. Unfortunately, there are no Georgians left to hunt in South Ossetia, and if their militia were to cross the Georgian border, it would <s>get its ass kicked fucking hard</s> Have the Georgian Army running scared back to their leader.

== Responsibility and Bawwwing ==

=== Responsibility === 

This section can easily be summed up as the Georgians attacked, and the Russians, being Russians, over-reacted. Saakashvili’s theory is that mystic Russian forces entered Georgia’s territory, using a Martian Stealth Shield. As with all Neocons who imagine shit that doesn’t exist, (see WMDs in Iraq and Saddam-Osama links), Saakashvili attacked. Seeing their troops and civilians under attack, the Russians promptly kicked the Georgians out of Ossetia. And then it happened: Russia saw bases to plunder, and military infrastructure to destroy. When you have nothing between you and the military base of the country that attacked you, loot it in the name of self-defense! And that’s what the Russians did. 

=== EU being useless as usual ===

A year after the war, the European Union wrote a report on it. As with all things where Britain and France had to agree, the Report cost millions of dollars and restated the obvious, except in complex legalese format. The Wikipedos hailed the Report as a savior and built an altar around it, making it the largest single-source section in the article. WP:Dear Reader would disagree, due to all the legalese junk, but when the British and French agree on something, the Europeans must tell everyone about it, irrespective of whether it’s needed or not. It’s not needed, as the OSCE watchdog and all of the sane ambassadors concluded in days, what the report took a year to conclude. If you are wondering what that is, re-read the previous paragraph. 

=== Bawwing about non-existant shit === 

After the Ossetian War ended, both sides claimed genocide, or ethnic cleansing in the alternative. Neither HRW nor any other sane organization confirmed genocide or ethnic cleansing, as it is not possible to confirm something that doesn’t exist. That didn’t stop the Wikipedos from creating an article on it, because after all, non-existent events deserve articles too! Just for the lulz, Russia and Georgia sued each other in the International Court of Human Rights, showing a better sense of humor than most Wikipedos. 

=== HRW Stating the Obvious === 

The HRW found out that the Georgians have mercilessly shelled a civilian city, that had more civilians then military, and denied the civvies escape routes. Much to Saakashvili’s surprise the HRW found that illegal. The HRW also found arson illegal. Marauding was also branded illegal. Naturally no realistic solutions were offered to fix the problems. 

=== HRW Bawwing ===

The war really pissed off the HRW. How can both sides use cluster bombs, so damn effectively, when HRW is trying, and miserably failing, to ban their use?! The HRW boldly condemned the use of cluster bombs, and got laughed at by the International Community, which signed a Convention to allow greater use of cluster bombs. "Shit, they’re going to be used illegally anyways, might as well make it legal," the head of the Convention said. Cluster Bombs 1,000 – HRW 0.

=== HRW + NYT Misstating the Obvious === 

However HRW and New York Times both got their numbers wrong. Out of a population of 15,000, the HRW claimed that 20,000 could not return home, while the New York Times raised that number to 30,000. The entire coverage of the war by the New York Times was so spectacular, that the newspaper received the Stalin Pravda Award, previously given to Baghdad Bob. Despite the fact that the war had roughly 722 military deaths, (500 Georgian, 150 Ossetian, 1 Abkhaz and 71 Russian) and under 600 civilian deaths, (365 Ossetian, first 69 then 228 Georgian and a Darwin Award recipient, totaling 584), the New York Times proceeded to claim that “civilian deaths greatly trumped military deaths”. However with Saakshvili at the helm, the Georgian number of civilian deaths is likely to grow to 400 soon. These people must have a time machine, that they use to go and get killed. Of course the NY Times also claimed Genocide, on the basis of [insert fact here, the NYT doesn’t really have any facts to prove genocide]. Does anyone take them seriously?

== International Reaction ==

The International Reaction ranged from countries stating that Russia was ebil, to countries stating that Russia Rocks! It was anything but unanimous. As for the average person, they just didn’t give a shit. Here’s a sampling: 

United States: [[W|George Bush]] condemned Russia’s provocative, illegal, and aggressive acts of defending its citizens, looting NATO war guides, capturing American-made equipment, and embarrassing the crony he placed in power. “A country cannot invade another country in the 21st Century,” Bush said, just before ordering another bombing of Baghdad. When Obama came to power, he realized how badly the Georgians lost and realized that Russians might actually be helpful, reworded Bush’s stance, merely stating what the US Ambassador said on the second day of the war: “Russia went too far in its retaliation”. This caused Saakashvili to claim that he’ll bawww until 2013! To make up for all the butthurt, the U.S. sent a bunch of aid to Georgia, but to Bush's utter shock, the Russians actually stopped and inspected it, causing even MOAR butthurt to Bush.

United Kingdom: The Jew David Milliband, or Millipede as he is adoringly called by his fans, blamed Russia for being ebil and mirrored Bush’s language, showing that the Colonial relationship is still there, but with Washington being the master. Hey the Brits were on top all this time, might as well be on the bottom for once. After finding out that Russians stole NATO Guides, he called Saakashvili’s actions of failing at ethnic cleansing, killing peacekeepers, destroying an entire city, totally getting his ass kicked, and lying to the entire world, "reckless”, and saying that even with Georgia doing what it was, it did not justify "one country invading another", just as more British troops were being sent to [[Afghanistan]]. Eventually the Amerofags got [[Gordon Brown]], their favorite Euro-poodle, to announce that he'd [[internet tough guy|do whatever it took to counter Russkie aggression]] in the form of threatening sanctions, drawing up a UN resolution condemning Russia, and generally holding his breath until he got what he wanted. This was a SRS BIZNS attack on the Russian people as it almost caused the entire population of Russia to die of laughter.

Ukraine: President Yushenko threatened to close Russia’s base in Crimea, which caused everyone in the Ukrainian Army to piss his pants because of the smackdown by Russia that would follow, and which caused Prime Minister Timoshenko to call Yushenko “an idiot”. Prime Minister Timoshenko then said that Ukraine stood with the democratically appointed emperor of Georgia. Meanwhile Ukrainian Parliament Member Valeriy Konovalyuk was interested where all that money for equipment transferred to Russia through Georgia went, and demanded to check Yushenko’s Swiss Bank Account. This caused Yushenko to shut his trap. The commander of the Ukrainian Navy ordered his ships to block Russian ships from reentering their base in Crimea, but the highly trained Ukrainian sailors did not know how to swim, so they told him to "do it himself". To make up for this major butthurt, Ukraine began sending more weapons to Georgia by ship, while openly [[Asking for it|bragging about it to Russia]]. However Yushenko and Timoshenko lost the Ukrainian elections to pro-Kremlin candidate, Yanukovich, who is now looking at Yushenko's Swiss Bank Account and thinking and Christmas. 

China: The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that "China expresses great concern over the escalation of tension and armed conflicts in South Ossetia", after realizing that if world attention turned away from the Beijing Olympics, the Chinese Government could lose billions of dollars. China called for the "Olympic Truce" to be respected, and asked both sides for an immediate cease-fire as its police beat up and shot hundreds of Tibetans, then took them to prison where they assraped them (Literally!).

France: France decided to try to organize a ceasefire (NOT a surrender). When their peace treaty was signed, the Russians sent a tank column towards Tblisi while the Georgian Army ran from it, thinking that the French would not respond in any way (given French history), but showing a bit of courage and pride, President Sarkozy formally complained about Russia's breaking of the cease-fire. To avoid pissing off either Bush or Putin, Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchener said that France did not care about who was good or bad, it just wanted to [[Hippie|stop the war]]. However this was too bold of an action for France to take on it's own, so they begged for German help. 

Germany: Germany agreed to negotiate a cease-fire with France, but leaned towards Russia. This pissed off Bernard Kouchner of France, who bawwwed all by himself and wasn’t allowed in the negotiating room. At the same time, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that she found some of Russia's actions "disproportionate", but that "both sides" were to blame, to avoid pissing off the Russkies or the Amerofags. After Germany accused Georgia of breaking a cease-fire and attacking South Ossetia, it then said Russia was "equally guilty" for enforcing international law and preventing Ethnic Cleansing.  

Italy: Wanting a Russian oil pipeline and having no relationship with Georgia, Italy stated that they are “very close to Putin’s position” and didn’t want an anti-Russian coalition in Europe, reminding Europeans that winter’s a coming, and Russian natural gas is needed. Italy also realized that in a war, Russia would be the better partner, and dared to keep a cool head throughout the ordeal.

Nauru: Nauru decided to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia in exchange for Russian aid, as a "fuck off" to the Americunts after they wouldn't give it themselves. What do you if you are a small, independent country, protected by Russia, and you want to piss off [[Americunts]]? Jack the Americunt tactics. When Kosovo declared independence, Americunts bribed small countries, like Palau, to recognize Kosovo. Following that tradition, and acting on their own fucking initiative, Abkhazia bribed Nauru with promises of Russian aid money to recognize Abkhazia, thus ending Americunt claims to supremacy in the Pacific with a stroke of a pen. This is the first time that the Americunt Empire was [[pwned]] by a country that doesn't officially exist. How do you say "I pwn" in Abkhazian?

Belarus: Seeing that the Russians were going to protect the Ossetians, and realizing that means that Russians will also honor their military alliance with Belarus, not to mention joint trainings with an army that kicks ass, Lukashenko quickly reminded Putin that the Belarus-Russia dispute is merely an economic one, and stated that “Russia acted calmly, wisely and beautifully”. He even offered to provide free schooling to 2,000 Ossetian kids, a privilege that the parents of 2,000 Ukrainian kids would kill for. Belarus sent humanitarian aid to South Ossetia in order to please Russia. Belarusian police also [[murder|peacefully dispersed]] anti-Russian [[mercenaries|demonstrators]] in Minsk. 

Nicaragua: Wanting a military alliance with Russia, Nicaragua recognized the Independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, causing even more bawwwing from the anti-Russian coalition. Nicaragua also looked at Contras and said - "wat now biatches" - causing even more bawwwing from [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and Contra supporters.

Israel: Israel promised Russia that it would not give Georgia any more weapons after Russia threatened to realease captured Israeli War Guides to Iran, but Israel then started pumping in more money and weapons into Georgia to kiss up to Bush. Israel sent military advisors to lead Georgian Army, and they were easily recognized by the Russians due to their Jew noses. When Israel realized that the Georgian slaughter of Ossetians might be compared to Israel's [[Holocaust|war]] with [[Palestine]], it said that Israel was following the war with "great concern", hoped for a quick "end to the violence", "recognizes the territorial integrity of Georgia", and "calls for a peaceful solution".

Georgia: When Russia began assraping Georgia, President Saakashvili personally got on [[fail|CNN]] and asked the world to stop Russia's merciless and horrific aggression so that he could continue his own. Sukashvili then said that the [[bullshit|Russians bombed Tskhinvali and killed Ossetians to make him look bad]]!!! WTF!!!??? He called Russia's actions of stopping his ethnic cleansing operations "illegal". As Russian tanks rolled into Georgia and the Georgian Army ran in the opposite direction to save itself from being ''totally'' destroyed, the Georgian government begged the world to step in to prevent its downfall. When no one did, Georgia realized for the first time that it was all alone facing a superpower, and began crying for a cease-fire. Saakashvili fled Georgia. 

Russia: Prime Minister Putin called the US a bunch of hypocrites for bombing Iraq and hanging Saddam, and hinting he was going to do the same, and put in a pro-Russian puppet. Putin then told French President Sarkozy that he was going to hang Saakashvili by the balls. However, Putin failed, because he could not find a rope tiny enough to fit Saakashvili's balls. Russia ignored all the protests from Europe and the USA, and Putin and President Medvedev almost died laughing when hearing of "consequences" of throwing a U.S. crony from power, knowing very well that Europe could not do shit when Russia gives them gas and has nukes, and that the U.S. couldn't do shit either while getting its ass kicked in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]].

After making sure that they were capable of Nuking Europe into oblivion without the [[terrorist|''Iranian'']] missile shield shooting them down, the Russians decided to piss off the Americans and Eurofags even more by showing that they can't do jack shit to the Red Empire.

ANNEXING SOUTH OSSETIA INTO THE RUSSIAN EMIPIRE

Thus making the Georgians fail even greater. Now the Russians are booting everyone who's still gay for Mikhail out of South Ossetia, which is about as common in Ossetia as a nigger in a Klansman house.

== Nicaragua finally gets revenge for the Contras ==

In a bid to get revenge for being pwnd by American backed [[freedom]] fighters  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras] [[at least 100 years ago]], Nicaragua has recognised South Ossetia. This is [[lulzy]] because the reason the US sent the goon squad in in the first place was because it feared that Nicaragua would become a pawn of Moscow. 

Expect many other countries that America has pissed off in the past to follow suit. Payback's a bitch!



== Russia finds some Jew Airfields in Failorgia ==

Deciding that they wanted to find out where the 100 Jew UAVs that they have shot-down over Ahkazian waters been coming from, they decided to raid two Georgian Air fields.

But to their surprise, they uncovered that the jews secretly had bought the Airfields from the Georgians with their jewgolds so they could [[jews did wtc|do Iranian nuclear power plants]], and found out that the Jews have been spying on South Russia, East Kazakhstan and North Iran.

After finding out that the Kikes are spying on them, and had bought 2 air fields from the Failorgians, the Russians responded by stealing the kike technologies, and then Selling Iran and Syria moar AA and tanks. Of course, the Failiorgians got away with most of their UAVs.

==Mutiny for the Lulz Time to blame the Russians ==

9 Month after the country he was playing for got pwnt by the motherland, A Good Old Soviet Commander in what left of the Georgian Army balls his self after the Russians gave him many of the jew golds they found at the Isreali Airfields they raided, decided me to troll the fuck out of him and before NATO sent 1000 Polack and Frenchie troops to a base 30 miles away.

On the eve of the Polacks and Frenchies ariving, he started a coup encompassing nearly all the Georgians that weren't still gay for Sakhasivilisi that hadn't already defected to Russia, managed to gather a 500 soldiers and 30 tanks (about half of the Georgian Tanks left when the Red Army Somehow missed them) called up Sahaaksivillis to tell them that they to come and get 'em!

Saaskisvilli immediately got butthurt and sent over 9000 soldiers and cops along with Georgia's last remaining tanks and helicopters to surround the base they took over they stated they wouldn't use force and would stay inside the barracks, and promptly ended the coups peacefully.

This of course was all bullshit, and one of Saakhasvilli's fake, shitty attempts to blame the Russians for everything in hops that NATO will let them join them, like Georgian soldiers attacking Western Reporters then promptly claiming they were Russian despite the fact that the fucking reporters they were shooting at knew they were Georgian.

==Darwin Award==

What war would be complete with a Darwin Award? Originally the Darwin Award was going to go to Saakashvili, for fucking with Putin, but Saakashvili ran off to Azerbaijan, like a true Neocon commander, boldly abandoning his troops in the face of the Russian Bear. The award was picked up by a Nordic Idiot, Stan Storimans, proving once again that the Nordic Race is just as stupid as any other race, but since some [[Nazi]] [[fag]]s still consider themselves the superior race, despite getting assraepd, (quite literally,) in the World's Second Attempt to end all wars, it is insulting to them to mention Storimans' stupidity. Do it as often as you can, do it [[over 9000]] times! 

Here's what happened: The Red Air Force was bombing Failorgia in a north to south pattern. The Russians have just bombed an area north of where Storimans was located. The area Storimans was in, had a tank battalion and an ammunition dump. "Clearly the area is safe for filming", concluded Storimans, and began filming. The Iskander promptly delivered Storimans' Darwin Award on the wings of "tough love". To make this even more [[lulz]]y, Storimans was killed in Gori, Georgia, Stalin's city of birth. Go Slavs go, deliver Darwin Awards to the Nordic Idiots!

Russia is a big [[bully]] and sometimes bullies have to be given a bloody nose by the other [[pedobear|kids in the playground]].|A patriotic Westerner, who supports the centrist politics of such two-party states as the USA and the UK.

|So are you going to be at war with Russia by Sunday? Do you plan to [[unrealistic expectations|bomb Moscow and St. Petersburg and other Russian cities]]? Well, if you do, I must tell you that we the Russians [[patriot|know what Motherland means]]. And we´ll do our [[best]] to make your [[fart|asses burn]] like in [[tonight we dine in hell|HELL]]!!!|A [[crzrussian|pissed off Russian]].

|Russia needs to know that it is insignificant in the face of NATO - it no longer has any real power. The EU & US should secure Georgia and access to its vast oil reserves. [[unrealistic expectations|Then on to MOSCOW]]!|W, UK, 8/8/2008 17:31. [[Typical]] [[ignorant]] [[cocksucker]] who deserves Russian tanks going straight through [[hir]] hometown and destroying hir home.

At least no more attractive people get hurt anymore.
