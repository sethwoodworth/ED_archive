Safe Environment
[[Image:Awesomeangel.jpg|500px|center]]<br/>

Seeking to clean up its tarnished public image in the face of a massive priest [[pedophilia|child sex abuse]] crisis, the [[Catholic]] Church has attempted to foist the belief that magical "guardian angels" are now  [[stalker|in position]] to keep their priests from fucking your kids.  The only problem is that guardian angels don't exist and therefore [[asking for it|your kids are just as unsafe as ever]]... sorry!  Perhaps this is a good thing since, as seen from the [[Verbose Thread|comic book]], it would be very annoying to have a [[tl;dr|mouthy]] flying bitch following us around spouting [[PROTIP|tips]] on how to avoid being priest-fucked.
