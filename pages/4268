[16:19] <~JackNapier> thetudorrose is the leak
[16:19] <andromeda> so that was recent of a screenshot
[16:19] <andromeda> because I didn't have 22 posts until today
[16:19] <Apology> yeah they got our whole sock puppet thread
[16:20] <Apology> well and isn't that Sissy chick an English history freak
[16:20] <~JackNapier> ip ban tudor rose?
[16:20] <Apology> she wrote the necrophiliac fan fic about queen elizabeth and robert semple or whoever
[16:20] <andromeda> yeah
[16:20] <Apology> plus there's a bunch of dumb rose shit on her fanfic site
[16:21] <Apology> I vote gone
[16:21] * musey (~chatzilla@synIRC-DAA45A0B.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #cultofrick
[16:21] <andromeda> BunnySkull you around?
[16:22] <JenJens> lay a smackdown
[16:22] <musey> heya again
[16:22] <JenJens> we found the leak, musey
[16:22] <musey> who's that?
[16:23] <JenJens> thetudorrose
[16:24] <musey> how'd you find out?
[16:25] <andromeda> oh mothergoddamnfucker
[16:25] <andromeda> I was posting as LadyL. And I didn't get this link from you; Jack was mistaken. I got it from the ED talk page.
[16:25] * andromeda facepalms
[16:26] <~JackNapier> what
[16:26] * musey is confused ... but that is not new.
[16:26] <~JackNapier> what 
[16:26] <andromeda> that tudorrose person posted that in the forums
[16:26] <~JackNapier> oh
[16:26] <~JackNapier> damnit
[16:27] <musey> ah
[16:27] <musey> i feel so useless .... what can i do to ... help or do something?
[16:28] <andromeda> eh I just feel like a retard for not noticing that sooner
[16:29] <musey> as in locale? or how did i find myself on cutlofrick?
[16:29] <~JackNapier> yeah
[16:29] <musey> im from Oregon and im a goon
[16:29] <andromeda> muse is samboni, right?
[16:29] <Apology> yah musey has bonafides
[16:29] <@NatashaQuick> yeah
[16:29] <musey> yes
[16:30] <andromeda> thought so
[16:30] <Apology> but if you check the bonafides thread, tudorrose never gave one really
[16:30] <~JackNapier> well apparently whoever added some people are retarded
[16:30] <@NatashaQuick> TheTudorRose was the one that posted the chat logs of Dan trying to get in
[16:30] <musey> i got the sight from Natasha
[16:30] <musey> site*
[16:30] <~JackNapier> like half the cultmembers have less than 2 posts
[16:30] <@NatashaQuick> TheTudorRose got in when the sign-ups were open
[16:30] <~JackNapier> why do we need them
[16:30] <andromeda> i pmed Zoso saying that earlier
[16:30] <~JackNapier> meh
[16:30] <andromeda> that half of them haven't posted or anything, get rid of em
[16:30] <Apology> tudorrose posted "  Yeah, I'm not on SA, or at least not anymore. I could post a photograph or even call someone. In fact calling would probably be better given my digital camera isn't working at the moment.   I'm not Dan. I'm from the U.S. (and not New York) and I have a female voice. "
[16:31] <Apology> nobody ever followed up on it though *facepalm*
[16:31] <@NatashaQuick> if it was sissy she'd tell dan everything
[16:31] <musey> ugh ... 'tudor' ... *facepalm*
[16:31] <Apology> she's posted 21 times though, so just eliminating lurkers wouldn't get her
[16:32] <andromeda> yeah
[16:32] <@NatashaQuick> yeah that's why we don't want to just go banning people
[16:32] <Apology> she'd still be in if we just banned people with low post counts
[16:32] <~JackNapier> wait
[16:32] <~JackNapier> what was her signup email
[16:32] <@NatashaQuick> i'll get it for you
[16:32] <Apology> yes please do something horrible to her
[16:33] <~JackNapier> it was probably a throwaway
[16:33] <Apology> perhaps a large picture of a man's bunghole
[16:33] <~JackNapier> but it would be the most recent email we got of her
[16:33] <Apology> most likely
[16:33] <Apology> but still, don't you check your throwaways for communications
[16:33] <musey> well if she's as smart as rick ... it's probably her main email
[16:33] <Apology> so you can run your scams
[16:33] <@NatashaQuick> also, if dan knew about this forum from teh first day
[16:33] <Apology> lol true musey
[16:33] <@NatashaQuick> which is when thetudorrose showed up
[16:33] <@NatashaQuick> he'd already be on
[16:33] <@NatashaQuick> i'm still checking on it though
[16:34] <musey> has anyone with a newer reg date on SA applied to join cult?
[16:34] <@NatashaQuick> nope 
[16:34] <~JackNapier> NatashaQuick get the email
[16:34] <@NatashaQuick> where does sissy live right now?
[16:35] <Apology> well everybody who responded from SA is probably good
<b>[16:35] <@NatashaQuick>  	jeniann13@yahoo.com</b>
[16:35] <Apology> for instance, Sally Slug has only posted once, but I know her
[16:35] <@NatashaQuick> yeah and all the SA accounts either did PM or added something to their profile
[16:35] <~JackNapier> whoa
[16:35] <~JackNapier> you're fucking kidding me
[16:35] <andromeda> whattt
[16:35] <andromeda> you mentioned that email earlier
[16:36] <andromeda> was that the myspace er?
[16:36] <Apology> lol
[16:36] <Apology> she is p. dumb
[16:36] <@NatashaQuick> nobody that isn't a goon has gotten in since the signups closed
[16:36] <musey> http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080416184733AA0nDFn

[16:37] <andromeda> don't worry
[16:37] <andromeda> I made one just for a purpose like this
[16:37] <andromeda> what should I do
[16:38] <Apology> I can't see her face through the airbrush
[16:38] <@NatashaQuick> friend it
[16:38] <~JackNapier> add her
[16:38] <Apology> yeah
[16:38] <andromeda> that's a whole lotta uggo bitch
[16:38] <andromeda> okay
[16:38] <~JackNapier> last login 5/14
[16:38] <Apology> too bad the clone stamp can't make your nose smaller
[16:38] <andromeda> let me edit my profile a little
[16:38] <@NatashaQuick> well the profile for this person says VA beach and her IP comes back VA beach too
[16:38] <@NatashaQuick> where does sissy live right now?
[16:39] <~JackNapier> how many friends do you have andromeda
[16:39] <Apology> lol
[16:39] <~JackNapier> virginia
[16:39] <@NatashaQuick> i remember her being in america
[16:39] <andromeda> 3
[16:39] <~JackNapier> near the DC border
[16:39] <musey> she's also on an Evanescence fan site
[16:39] <andromeda> 2 of them are in DC
[16:39] <~JackNapier> i mean hold up damn
[16:39] <~JackNapier> that means i already got a pic of her
[16:39] <Apology> I have a myspace where all my friends are cats
[16:39] <@NatashaQuick> apology lol
[16:39] <Apology> OH DO SHARE MY FRIEND
[16:39] <andromeda> i shudder that i just put "i love me some evanescence" in my profile
[16:39] <Apology> LOL
[16:40] <Apology> you can take a long, healthy shower after this andromeda
[16:40] <~JackNapier> http://www.gaiaonline.com/profiles/?u=3186218
[16:40] <@NatashaQuick> we have pics of sissy
[16:40] <Apology> unfortunately the one with all the cats is an Apology account so it's a dead giveaway :(
[16:40] <~JackNapier> http://j.photos.cx/l_cb4abe8749c7a9de99a83a35d550cda1-e44.jpg
[16:40] <~JackNapier> does this look like the photo
[16:41] <andromeda> yup
[16:41] <andromeda> that big ass honker of a nose gives it away
[16:41] <musey> http://www.fictionpress.com/u/455385/
[16:41] <~JackNapier> ahahahhaha
[16:41] <~JackNapier> sheeeeeeeit
[16:41] <~JackNapier> i wish i tried the email earlier
[16:41] <@NatashaQuick> i don't get it
[16:41] <@NatashaQuick> how does this tell us anything
[16:42] <Apology> the secret is, you put 4 ounces of light-reflecting mineral makeup on your giant schnozz
[16:43] <Apology> that way, with all the light reflecting off you, you can't be seen clearly at all
[16:43] <@NatashaQuick> and if they were a leaker why would they post about the first time he tried to get into the forum
[16:43] <andromeda> to throw people off? who knows
[16:43] <Apology> let's post some fake news in the forum
[16:44] <Apology> I'm not sure what though
[16:44] <~JackNapier> hey NatashaQuick
[16:44] <~JackNapier> did the forum require email verifications?
[16:44] <Apology> talk about having a goon going to Dan's house this weekend maybe
[16:45] <Apology> how to give yourself a nose job at home with a Sharpie and a penkknife
[16:45] <@NatashaQuick> and the last thing she posted was a copy of what lolita put up on sissy on badfanfics
[16:45] <@NatashaQuick> i don't think it does jack
[16:45] <Apology> I didn't have to, but Bunnyskull pushed me through due to SA verification
[16:45] <@NatashaQuick> yeah we do it that way
[16:46] <~JackNapier> well
[16:47] <~JackNapier> verify it's her
[16:47] <@NatashaQuick> what do you mean
[16:47] <Apology> we should probably look at all the zero posters too
[16:47] <~JackNapier> natasha
[16:47] <~JackNapier> give me a list of emails
[16:47] <@NatashaQuick> well one of them is timb for example
[16:47] <~JackNapier> like PM them to me
[16:47] <~JackNapier> timb is yospos
[16:48] <@NatashaQuick> i'm saying having 0 posts means nothing
[16:48] <~JackNapier> anyway natasha compile the emails and PM them to me
[16:48] <@NatashaQuick> what do you want to do with the emails
[16:48] <~JackNapier> look at them
[16:48] <~JackNapier> see if i recognize any others
[16:48] <~JackNapier> i read a lot of shit the past 2 days
[16:48] <~JackNapier> on sissy etc
[16:48] <@NatashaQuick> yeah
[16:48] <~JackNapier> might recognize one
[16:48] <Apology> yah you're right, most of the 0 posters signed up after the forums were closed
[16:48] <@NatashaQuick> ok just don't go crazy and start stalking/harassing/banning people
[16:48] <~JackNapier> i also saw a whole bunch of emails loli gave me
[16:49] <~JackNapier> that sissy used
[16:49] <@NatashaQuick> cool
[16:49] <@NatashaQuick> still i think if she were here then dan would know everything
[16:49] <@NatashaQuick> but it can't hurt
[16:49] <Apology> were they closed after the 28th?
[16:50] <@NatashaQuick> it was the third day iirc
[16:50] <Apology> I'm wondering about thewarondrugslost and gatorownage
[16:51] <Apology> idk probably it means nothing but it seems a little odd to sign up for a forum and then not post in it at all
[16:52] <~JackNapier> sent the pic to lolita
[16:53] <~JackNapier> hey
[16:53] <~JackNapier> http://www.myspace.com/lady_leicester
[16:53] <~JackNapier> that's the myspace i found earlier
[16:53] <~JackNapier> lolita said it wasn't her
[16:53] <~JackNapier> but she can't know for sure
[16:53] <Apology> yeah I remember, my eyes still hurt from that
[16:53] <Apology> looks like the same schnozz to me though
[16:54] <@NatashaQuick> those two were bunnyskulls but they were SA members
[16:54] <@NatashaQuick> in anycase dan says it's a goon
[16:54] <Apology> okay, that's good then
[16:54] <@NatashaQuick> yeah most everybody is a goon
[16:54] <~JackNapier> okay
[16:54] <@NatashaQuick> nobody after the 3rd day is not a goon
[16:54] <musey> dan says a goon is giving him the info?
[16:54] <~JackNapier> regarding the Lady myspace
[16:54] <~JackNapier> "(for a while she claimed this was Alyssa's email address but it never worked for Alyssa and Alyssa herself claimed that it was an old one of Sissy's that Sissy was using at the moment to pose as Alyssa)
[16:54] <~JackNapier> "
[16:54] <@NatashaQuick> that's what he said yeah
[16:55] <@NatashaQuick> that doesn't mean it is a gon
[16:55] <musey> well i added the jeniann to my yahoo msgr
[16:55] <musey> maybe she'll take the bait
[16:55] <~JackNapier> what
[16:55] <~JackNapier> don't all pile on
[16:55] <~JackNapier> just 1 add
[16:55] <~JackNapier> all we need
[16:55] <~JackNapier> goddamn
[16:55] <~JackNapier> don't make her suspicious
[16:55] <~JackNapier> what's the yahoo thing gonna do?
[16:56] <~JackNapier> "yeah hey, could i get your pics plz kthx"
[16:56] <musey> who knows... i sent an introduction saying 'i read ur stories'
[16:56] <musey> see what happens
[16:56] <@NatashaQuick> "(for a while she claimed this was Alyssa's email address but it never worked for Alyssa and Alyssa herself claimed that it was an old one of Sissy's that Sissy was using at the moment to pose as Alyssa)
[16:56] <@NatashaQuick> what email address
[16:56] <Apology> "I like dead queens too"
[16:57] <~JackNapier> uh
[16:57] <~JackNapier> the one i used to find the other pic
[16:57] <~JackNapier> about 6 hours ago
[16:57] <~JackNapier> also
[16:57] <~JackNapier> the myspace i found had blog posts of her stories
[16:58] <~JackNapier> not sissy's but alyssa's
[16:58] <~JackNapier> i'm fucking confused
[16:58] <@NatashaQuick> me too lol
[16:58] <~JackNapier> either sissy's whole lifestyle revolves around imitating people or she's fucking wicked
[16:58] <@NatashaQuick> one reason why i'm cautious about the banhammer
[16:58] <@NatashaQuick> that happened to me once
[16:58] <andromeda> i added her on myspace
[16:58] <~JackNapier> Last Login: 5/14/2009  
[16:58] <@NatashaQuick> somebody leaked some stuff on a super elitist forum, though it was more elitist than this one :P
[16:58] <andromeda> not the lady_leicester one
[16:58] <@NatashaQuick> and i got kicked out for it
[16:58] <andromeda> or whatever the hell that is
[16:59] <@NatashaQuick> it took me all of 15 minutes to figure out who really did it
[16:59] <~JackNapier> oh
[16:59] <~JackNapier> JAL
[16:59] <andromeda> yeah
[16:59] <@NatashaQuick> but since they just kicked me out instead of evn asking a question
[16:59] <~JackNapier> stands for Jeniann Leicester
[16:59] <@NatashaQuick> i teamed up with the people who realyl did it and brought them down even harder :P
[16:59] <~JackNapier> I love Harry Potter. I also love the Tudors. I'm a history nut. I love any music not older than I am and I love Gilmore Girls (at least everything before season six) and Desperate Houswives.
[16:59] <~JackNapier> from her gaiaonline
[17:00] <@NatashaQuick> sissys or thetudorrose
[17:00] <~JackNapier> tudorrose doesnt count anymore

[17:02] <@NatashaQuick> sissy is amyleefan
[17:02] <~JackNapier> wait a second
[17:02] <~JackNapier> sissy was accused of stealing jeni's work
[17:02] <@NatashaQuick> on badfanfics?
[17:02] <~JackNapier> i'm trying to find out if she just used a different name and jeni never accused her but other people did
[17:02] <Apology> the gaia has jeni's work

[17:03] <~JackNapier> where is her work

[17:17] <~JackNapier> hold on bella
�09[17:17] * Bellatricks was kicked by JackNapier (JackNapier)
[17:17] <~JackNapier> Bellatrix Black was a good girl once, but that was a long time ago.

[17:17] <~JackNapier> over-reacting?
[17:17] <@NatashaQuick> um that's someone from harry potter

�09[17:18] * Bellatricks () has joined #cultofrick
[17:19] <BunnySkull> well I say abandon forum - I can easily delete it.  Then we move to the new password protected one
[17:19] <JenJens> yeah
[17:19] <Bellatricks> what threads did Dan post
[17:19] <Apology> I'm thinking we seed the old forum with fake information
[17:19] <BunnySkull> Everyone okay with the first forum deletion?
[17:19] <JenJens> go for it i say
[17:19] <@NatashaQuick> problem is how do we know who to move
[17:20] <@NatashaQuick> if we could figure that out all we'd have to do is ban them :\
[17:20] <BunnySkull> and this new forum - well very few people are going to be involved in the new one
[17:20] <BunnySkull> that's for sure
[17:20] <Apology> maybe we can pretend we're gonna call Dan's church
[17:20] <BunnySkull> fuck this 
[17:20] <@NatashaQuick> let's save the forum before you delete it
[17:20] <Bellatricks> I was just looking at his church's website
[17:20] <Apology> I say we keep it as a decoy
[17:20] <BunnySkull> Natasha - do whatever you want.  I guess we could keep it as a "fake forum" and only post BS there if we want
[17:21] <Apology> but really use the new one
[17:21] <BunnySkull> yeah, guess that's fine
[17:21] <Apology> heck I've been posting bs there all day
[17:21] <Apology> lol
[17:21] <JenJens> lol
[17:21] <BunnySkull> Let's really post wild stuff there - like we are talking to irl people in moncton
[17:21] <@NatashaQuick> i mean "save" as in screenshot
[17:21] <BunnySkull> really freak Dan out
[17:21] <Apology> maybe we could pretend that someone is going to Dan's church
[17:21] <BunnySkull> bad
[17:21] <BunnySkull> post a highfield baptist church thread
[17:21] <musey> it'd probably freak him out more if all of a sudden it was just gone *poof*
[17:21] <Apology> true, the irl monctonites is a good idea
[17:21] <@NatashaQuick> looool that's a good idea
[17:22] <Bellatricks> nono he goes to moncton faith vicory now
[17:22] <BunnySkull> K - give me a sec
[17:22] <~JackNapier> since i ip banned and user banned tudorrose

[17:22] <@NatashaQuick> yeah you said that ALF Was using thetudorrose's pics and stuff
[17:23] <~JackNapier> wait
[17:23] <@NatashaQuick> you said that 
[17:23] <BunnySkull> well if it was tudor rose the mole is gone
[17:23] <@NatashaQuick> that ALF was using her stuff in a fake myspace or something
[17:23] <Apology> we could pretend like we'd allied with his enemies at highfield baptist
[17:23] <~JackNapier> 68.10.156.231	US	UNITED STATES		VIRGINIA	VIRGINIA BEACH	COX COMMUNICATIONS INC
[17:23] <BunnySkull> yes, that's what I was thinking apology

[17:36] <~JackNapier> okay
[17:36] <~JackNapier> what are the chances sissy knew aimoo didn't require verification
[17:38] <~JackNapier> hm
[17:38] <~JackNapier> well
[17:38] <~JackNapier> jason didn't know
[17:38] <~JackNapier> "Confrim the account and find the URL to your profile. "
[17:38] <@NatashaQuick> yeah
[17:39] <~JackNapier> wait
[17:39] <~JackNapier> that was from sissy
[17:39] <~JackNapier> sissy sent the instructions to dan
[17:40] <@NatashaQuick> yeah
[17:40] <~JackNapier> so is this real or did sissy make 2 myspaces of alyssa
[17:40] <@NatashaQuick> i got the impression she took the instructions from jason
[17:40] <~JackNapier> er
[17:40] <~JackNapier> not alyssa, jeni
[17:40] <@NatashaQuick> sissy stealing a slightly prettier girl's pics lol
[17:41] <~JackNapier> see
[17:41] <@NatashaQuick> i still don't get why she'd point us to dan trying to get in
[17:42] <@NatashaQuick> we knew he was going to find it and try to get in
[17:42] <@NatashaQuick> at some point
[17:42] <@NatashaQuick> but we didn't know that he actually tried until thetudorrose posted it
[17:42] <@NatashaQuick> theweirdkind account was already pending, we just won't let any of them in until we get something from SA
[17:42] <musey> is she playin both sides of the field/
[17:42] <musey> ?
[17:43] <@NatashaQuick> dunno, but what jack dug up was pretty convincing
[17:43] <@NatashaQuick> see i was dumb and figured sissy would be in canada and she isn't
[17:43] <~JackNapier> alyssa said that the first email, harmony4life was sissy's older email
[17:44] <@NatashaQuick> well for example i have like 5 email accounts
[17:44] <@NatashaQuick> probably more
[17:45] <~JackNapier> but hold up
[17:45] <~JackNapier> lolia keeps talking about sissy posing as alyssa
[17:45] <~JackNapier> not jeni
[17:45] <@NatashaQuick> which one's alyssa
[17:46] <~JackNapier> supposedly sissy's brother's girlfriend
[17:46] <~JackNapier> at the time, circa 2008
[17:47] <musey> is sissy a harry potter nut?
[17:48] <@NatashaQuick> there is some connection on jeni and sissy
[17:48] <~JackNapier> man lolita's gonna be pissed
[17:49] <~JackNapier> i sent 3 PMs
[17:49] <Apology> I'm writing a fake thread on the main site
[17:49] <@NatashaQuick> since autoaim is out of the game we could ban his account just to keep people from hacking into it
[17:49] <~JackNapier> supposedly sissy stole Jeni's writing
[17:49] <~JackNapier> er
[17:49] <~JackNapier> Jenny's
[17:49] <Apology> drumming up donations to take out a derogatory ad in the Moncton Times & Transcript newspaper

[17:51] <Apology> it's solely to give any moles juicy gossip
[17:51] <@NatashaQuick> well you can, i took the donate icon off the forum
[17:51] <Apology> no actual donations will ever be collected
[17:51] <@NatashaQuick> cuz we don't want anybody's $
[17:51] <~JackNapier> i'm listening for names

[17:51] <~JackNapier> did you guys just missm my youtube link
[17:52] <Apology> holy crap that woulda sucked if people donated to the site, thinking it was for the ad

[17:55] <~JackNapier> gonna message her on youtube
[17:55] <~JackNapier> leave a comment
[17:55] <@NatashaQuick> no you'd have to go looking for the donate link since i took it off
[17:55] <Apology> c00l
[17:56] <musey> she hasnt been on there for 4 months
[17:56] <~JackNapier> what should i say
[17:56] <~JackNapier> I wish her dad said "Sissy" or something
[17:56] <Apology> okay so I'm gonna wait about an hour or so so that Bunnyskull's fake thread and my fake thread aren't too close together
[17:56] <@NatashaQuick> we have pics of sissy
[17:56] <~JackNapier> huh
[17:56] <@NatashaQuick> jeniann isn't sissy

[17:57] <~JackNapier> all signs point to jeni ann
[17:57] <@NatashaQuick> yeah
[17:57] <~JackNapier> unless sissy is leading us there
[17:57] <@NatashaQuick> no, she hid it

[17:58] <~JackNapier> your weird and ugly
[17:58] <~JackNapier> hahaha
[17:58] <@NatashaQuick> there's no way a gold plated sax was smelly
[17:58] <~JackNapier> the comment
[17:58] <Bellatricks> she didn't know what a salt shaker was
[17:58] <@NatashaQuick> that dad polishes and stuff
[17:59] <@NatashaQuick> there's too much coincidence
[17:59] <@NatashaQuick> who knows why she'd post the logs of dan trying to get in
[17:59] <@NatashaQuick> but, same area of the country, a lot of matching interests
[18:00] <~JackNapier> yeah
[18:00] <~JackNapier> but that's like saying one anti-abortionist = the other
[18:00] <@NatashaQuick> where did you see those roses you said were plastered all over some site
[18:00] <@NatashaQuick> of hers
[18:00] <~JackNapier> wait
[18:00] <~JackNapier> she is obsessed with royalty
[18:00] <@NatashaQuick> british royals yeah

[18:01] <~JackNapier> the roses
[18:01] <Apology> the wig is like a really cheesy Elizabethan costume wig

[18:19] <~JackNapier> Author: PersephoneMediocris
[18:20] <~JackNapier> Authors note: This is just the prologue or whatever for my new story. Please tell me what you think! I’d like to thank my beta reader Sissy who edited this for me overnight, she’s just wonderful.
[18:20] <@NatashaQuick> i didn't catch her talking about wallis
[18:20] <@NatashaQuick> just the tudors and king george III etc
[18:20] <~JackNapier> natasha read above
[18:21] <Bellatricks> heh now I have to go back again and catch the time where she said it
[18:21] <@NatashaQuick> ok the first link you posted, that was copy pasted and put on our site by thetudorrose
[18:21] <@NatashaQuick> well it's like i was thinking originally, she's a friend of sissy
[18:22] <@NatashaQuick> that's pretty much wraps it up i'd say
[18:22] <Bellatricks> 3:11 where she starts talking about when edward dumped his royalty for his wife (wallis simpson)
[18:22] <@NatashaQuick> and it's about a tranny named wallis lolololol
[18:22] <@NatashaQuick> oh ok
[18:23] <@NatashaQuick> yeah that's it jack
[18:23] <~JackNapier> natasha what do you mean copy pasted by her
[18:23] <~JackNapier> i made that PNG myself
[18:23] <~JackNapier> er jpg
[18:23] <@NatashaQuick> yeah she made another one
[18:23] <@NatashaQuick> i was in her post history i'll find it again
[18:23] <@NatashaQuick> last post she made
[18:24] <@NatashaQuick> http://cultofrick.aimoo.com/categroy/Topic-1-47303.html#NickName_189912
[18:24] <~JackNapier> oh
[18:24] <~JackNapier> so
[18:24] <~JackNapier> it's the same thing
[18:24] <@NatashaQuick> yeah
[18:24] <~JackNapier>  <@NatashaQuick> yeah that's it jack
[18:24] <~JackNapier> what does that mean
[18:24] <@NatashaQuick> it's her
[18:25] <@NatashaQuick> it means it's her
[18:25] <@NatashaQuick> your hunch was totally right
[18:25] <@NatashaQuick> she's friends with sissy
[18:25] <@NatashaQuick> they live nearby each other and both post on badfanfics
[18:25] <~JackNapier> wait
[18:25] <@NatashaQuick> she never said her account name on badfanfics so we don't know if it's really a new account
[18:26] <~JackNapier> what do you mean account name
[18:26] <@NatashaQuick> thetudorrose posted the thread saying "dan tried to get on here"
[18:26] <@NatashaQuick> and said she just made an account on badfanfics
[18:26] <@NatashaQuick> but we don't know the account name
[18:27] <@NatashaQuick> so we don't know if she has a new account, but we do know she's friends with sissy
[18:27] <~JackNapier> what if it's sissy herself?
[18:27] <@NatashaQuick> it could be yeah
[18:27] <~JackNapier> i mean
[18:27] <@NatashaQuick> doesn't really matter, i think you dug up plenty of dirt
[18:27] <~JackNapier> how can two friends share the exact same interests?
[18:27] <@NatashaQuick> right
[18:28] <@NatashaQuick> doesn't matter if she's sissy or friends with sissy either is enough info for us
[18:29] <~JackNapier> but but
[18:29] <~JackNapier> the EP page
[18:30] <~JackNapier> what's enough info if i want the EP page
[18:30] <~JackNapier> it has to be sissy
[18:30] <@NatashaQuick> i mean it's enough info to ban her as the leaker
[18:30] <~JackNapier> well no shit
[18:30] <~JackNapier> the screenshot from Dan does that
[18:30] <~JackNapier> :/

[18:55] <lolki> no no i mean, does he really have pages and pages of the fourm etc. like from jenyen's screen cap
[18:55] <~JackNapier> which one of you has the moncton forums acct
[18:55] <@NatashaQuick> yeah he probably has whatever was there until yesterday
[18:55] <~JackNapier> JenJens
[18:55] <@NatashaQuick> jenyens and zoso have them
[18:55] <andromeda> i thought jenyens
[18:55] <andromeda> yeah
[18:55] <Bellatricks> I only found 2
[18:55] <JenJens> yo
[18:55] <Bellatricks> that was uploaded to moncton forums
[18:56] <@NatashaQuick> he says he has it all though
[18:56] <@NatashaQuick> obviouslyhe doesn't have the mod board but that's it
[18:58] <Bellatricks> sounds like she was in it for the drama more than anything
[18:58] <~JackNapier> ok
[18:58] <~JackNapier> natasha
[18:58] <~JackNapier> question
[18:59] <~JackNapier> why would sissy employ jeni to invade our forums
[18:59] <andromeda> aw he made a new digg for monctonforums.
[18:59] <~JackNapier> when sissy could do it herself
[18:59] <~JackNapier> also there's nothing related to what jeni likes in the member section
[18:59] <~JackNapier> according to the list
[18:59] <Bellatricks> how do you know that sissy put jeni up to this
[19:00] <@NatashaQuick> they're friends
[19:00] <~JackNapier> thats not what i think
[19:00] <@NatashaQuick> or the same person
[19:00] <Bellatricks> maybe jeni is just a drama queen
[19:00] <~JackNapier> amylee registered the same day Dan got the pictures
[19:00] <@NatashaQuick> in any case she's banned and looks like she deserves her own ED article =D
[19:00] <~JackNapier> why would jeni have to do any of this
[19:00] <~JackNapier> i think sissy is jeni
[19:01] <@NatashaQuick> why would they think they'd need to change their passwords every 2 hours
[19:01] <@NatashaQuick> they're retarded
[19:01] <lolki> http://myrrander.blogspot.com/
[19:01] <lolki> there, there's a pic of me acting out a stupid meme and the archives are there for ya
[19:01] <~JackNapier> ahahaha
[19:01] <@NatashaQuick> ty lolki
[19:01] <@NatashaQuick> XD
[19:01] <@NatashaQuick> yes they're both retarded, thetudorrose account is banned
[19:02] <~JackNapier> THEY'RE THE SAME PERSON
[19:02] <@NatashaQuick> yeah
[19:02] <@NatashaQuick> let's save that youtube vid for when she inevitably takes it down lol
[19:02] <lolki> oh fuck tudor rose and the royal obsessed girl hahaha
[19:03] <~JackNapier> as usualy
[19:03] <~JackNapier> the 4channer got the joke late
[19:03] <lolki> lol thanks
[19:03] <~JackNapier> :p
[19:03] <~JackNapier> let's assume sissy and jeni are not the same
[19:03] <@NatashaQuick> i think we have her real name as well
[19:03] <~JackNapier> how would i comment on jeni's youtube to find out?
[19:03] <~JackNapier> sissy's or jeni's
[19:04] <@NatashaQuick> dunno, i can't use mine b/c it's called NatashaQuick
[19:04] <~JackNapier> lol
[19:04] <lolki> haha so, dan has everything and still called a fake school public safety officer?
[19:04] <@NatashaQuick> sissy is most likely jeni ann leicaster
[19:04] <~JackNapier> mine's named different
[19:04] <~JackNapier> but it's common
[19:04] <@NatashaQuick> well he thinks he has everything lol
[19:05] <@NatashaQuick> look this is how stupid these people are
[19:06] <@NatashaQuick> she sent the screens to dan who posted it on the monctonforums.com
[19:06] <@NatashaQuick> with her name logged in at the top
[19:06] <@NatashaQuick> if she'd been paying any attention she would know that we have accounts on his site
[19:06] <@NatashaQuick> and in fact one that he posted is the "we need sockpuppets" thread
[19:06] <@NatashaQuick> they're fucking DUMB
[19:06] <Bellatricks> I feel sorry for the school public safety officer that is read's Dan Lirette's SA thread
[19:07] <~JackNapier> Hello, I'm PersephoneMediocris! I'm only 14, but you wouldn't think so from talking to me. I heard about Loose Change from Gaia Online forums and was convinced something was amiss from the evidence in your video. I've always thought that maybe the government knew more than they said but your film really convinced me. I've tried to show my parents but they think I'm crazy (though I think they've always though that...) and won't watch Loose Change because they think it's silly.
[19:07] <~JackNapier> from 2006
[19:07] <@NatashaQuick> and now sissy is 16
[19:07] <@NatashaQuick> hasn't had her birthday yet

[19:24] <~JackNapier> it's not her fault
[19:24] <@NatashaQuick> they probably look fine in a bra
[19:24] <@ZoSo> hahaha
[19:24] <~JackNapier> bras don't help with that
[19:24] <~JackNapier> not the natural look
[19:24] <@NatashaQuick> yeah it is they sag if you DON'T WEAR A BRA
[19:24] <JenJens> boob tubes
[19:24] <@NatashaQuick> the skin stretches

[19:25] <~JackNapier> screengrab the email off aimoo
[19:25] <@NatashaQuick> which one
[19:25] <~JackNapier> this is why lolita hasnt gotten back to me
[19:25] <~JackNapier> fucking jeni's email
[19:25] <~JackNapier> jeniann13
[19:25] <@NatashaQuick> oh i deleted her
[19:25] <~JackNapier> god. damn.
[19:25] <~JackNapier> :OOOOOOOOOOO
[19:25] <@NatashaQuick> that was it
[19:25] <@NatashaQuick> jeniann13@yahoo.com
[19:25] <~JackNapier> OUR PROOF
[19:25] <~JackNapier> GONE
[19:25] <@NatashaQuick> why do we need proof
[19:25] <@ZoSo> we can find more
[19:26] <~JackNapier> because
[19:26] <~JackNapier> when the ED page is done
[19:26] <~JackNapier> we're gonna post it on badfanfics
[19:26] <andromeda> what proof
[19:26] <andromeda> her thread is still up
[19:26] <@NatashaQuick> he wants a shot of jeni's email from our site
[19:26] <andromeda> ah
[19:26] <@NatashaQuick> but he bannedh er and then i deleted her from the memberlist
[19:26] <@NatashaQuick> banned just means you can't post, she could possibly see the board being on the list
[19:26] <@NatashaQuick> i dunno really 
[19:27] <~JackNapier> no i banned the ip and the user
[19:27] <@NatashaQuick> it looks like it's set up that way with the permissions
[19:27] <@NatashaQuick> but i don't want to get too technical
[19:27] <~JackNapier> holy god damn
[19:27] <@NatashaQuick> well i can't put her back on there sorry
[19:27] <@NatashaQuick> we really don't need that
[19:28] <@NatashaQuick> she was advanced member too
[19:28] <lolki> haha damn
[19:28] <~JackNapier> no wonder lolita knew so much
[19:28] <@NatashaQuick> yeah and that explains why she was ilke
[19:28] <~JackNapier> people were commenting in the thread on badfansfics on how she knew so much
[19:28] <@NatashaQuick> "let's see if he gets in or not"
[19:29] <~JackNapier> that bitch
[19:29] <@NatashaQuick> well she's admin, but on most forums admins can't see the contents of PMs
[19:29] <~JackNapier> i'm going to ruin her
[19:29] <@ZoSo> jack just earned a call out page :3
[19:29] <@NatashaQuick> that was the only smart thing she did, post about dan's failure to get us to think she was legit
[19:30] <lolki> haha the funny thing is, even if she read the whole board, there really wasn't a lot else other than summary there...even if the con on dan was blown, he's no closer to anybody than he was before hahahaha
[19:30] <@ZoSo> this is just a tangled mess of sockpuppets
[19:30] <andromeda> seriously i haven't seen anything like this in years
[19:30] <@NatashaQuick> i have never seen anything like this
[19:30] <@ZoSo> me neither
[19:30] <@ZoSo> been around awhile, this is nuts
[19:30] <@NatashaQuick> at first i thought it might be comparable to ppppowerbook 
[19:31] <@NatashaQuick> how far does this crazy rabbit hole get and will i ever get to wonderland?
[19:31] <lolki> haha my slightly related question: bunnyskull has people from dan's church on the board???
[19:31] <@ZoSo> i think we just hit wonderland
[19:31] <@NatashaQuick> yeah lolki they aren't going to find anything on us
[19:31] <lolki> that's what put me down the rabbit hole
[19:31] <@NatashaQuick> probably because we don't have personal info up on the internet
[19:31] <@NatashaQuick> simple as that
[19:31] <lolki> haha and i don't use the same fucking nickname everywhere
[19:32] <@ZoSo> that should be obvious
[19:32] <lolki> hell, kill the forums

[19:41] <@NatashaQuick> this was the post thetudorrose made in the irc thread
[19:41] <@NatashaQuick>  New to IRC, I don't know if this is a stupid question. I have a Mac and the only program I could get that worked with synirc was Colloquy. I don't know if any of you use it. When I enter in the synirc info and then try to log into #cultofrick I get a box that says "this room is password protected" but there's no place for me to enter a password. 
[19:41] <@NatashaQuick> Anyone know what I need to do?  
[19:41] <@NatashaQuick> and i told her exactly how to do it
[19:41] <@NatashaQuick> and she nor dan still couldn't figure it out
