99.9 is a number less than 100, but pretty much the same number; [[shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about the difference]].

== Usage ==

'''99.9%''' (variantly, 90% 99%, 99.99%, etc) is a figure expressing absolute certainty, but leaving a slight chance of doubt to cover one's ass in the event that one happens to be talking out of it. Much like the [[at least 100 years ago]] and [[no more than 99 years ago]] clauses, but used by anyone from [[advertiser]]s to ignorant forum [[troll]]s in an attempt to validate an arguement otherwise based on hearsay and assumption. 99.9% of the time, "99.9%" holds no [[factual]] grounds, which as a matter of fact ''doesn't'' ensure any [[lulz]], since the people desperately trying to cover up their Green Day-inspired [[lie]]s are usually not worth caring about anyhow.

=== Examples ===

* "99.9% of the time Wolverine would pwn Spider-Man kekekekeke" 
* "''Guaranteed'' to kill ''99.9%'' of ''all'' [[Disease|germs]]!!!"
* "99.9% of [[teen]] [[marijuana]] usage can be attributed to bad parenting."
* "You have a 99.9% chance to get [[pwnt]] on the [[internet]]."
* "There is a 99.9% chance that you will [[fail]] 50% of the time."

== In Contrast to "100% Sure"==

To be "100% sure" of something, is to have no question in your mind that what you believe you know to be true. If someone says they are "100% sure" of something, chances are they are 100% full of [[shit]].
