'''Sam Rossenfoss''' is a pwnt pedo. On the 6th of August, one of his dorm-mates, a person known only to the Internet as JustKoders, found gay kidporn on his box, while using iTunes. Happily, said dorm-mate used [[4chan|4]]/[[7chan]], and posted the image to the right: a screencap of what appeared to be a dorm's shared iTunes folder. The ensuing [[PowerWord: IRL Name|powerword]] usage had to be seen to be believed. In an incredible display of hypocrisy, a [[7chan]] member decided that he no longer liked kidporn any more and reported him to the [[FBI]]. [[4chan]] decided that they [[X is not your personal army|didn't want to catch anyone]], deemed it un-lulzworthy and the admins deleted the thread. 

7chan did the rest of the work in a mad dash, aided with the posting of Rassenfoss's [[Facebook]] to dig up as much information on the pedo as possible, so as to [[ruin]] his shit. An [[AIM]] [[chatroom]] was set up and the [[4chan]] Party Van (temporarily renamed the Sammy Van) was alerted.  His phone number was posted.  Eventually a Facebook group of his entire family was found out. They even went so far as to have people download the files to check that they really were child porn and not misnamed. ''"Excuse me while I change ISPs then take a sledgehammer to my HDD"'', to quote one /b/tard. The most recent information available states that the [[Internet police|police]] had at that time let Rossenfoss go, but the case is still open and Rossenfoss may still be prosecuted.

He also worked at an adventure camp. With small [[children]]. Unsupervised. ;)

{{squote|So for the 4th of July, I basically have come upon a realization. We as Americans are so extremely lucky. This week at camp we have a group of children from ages 4-14 who are from Sudan. They have come fairly recently from the Darfur region and are not familiar with America and they know little or no english. Although I have some trouble because of the language barrier they are good kids. I have grown to appreciate how lucky I am to be alive, much less in a great country like America. Maybe I needed a wake-up call on that sort of thing.}}

{{squote|These past few weeks working with kids have really made me think about my future. The whole thing was a little scary at first but lately as it has gone on I have grown to love it. I have just thought how needed teachers are and from my own experiences. I think it would be good to have an impact on someones life in the more impressionable years and particularly working with elementary school age kids could do that. Just thoughts...}}

Robbert from the ground floor across the hall from Sam Rassenfoss found the taped picture on the door, and turned it in to the campus police. After giving them information and evidence, the cops returned later that night to confiscate Sam's laptop.
