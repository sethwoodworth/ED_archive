<br><br>Wetflame is an [[Woman|emotional being]] and can only respond to [[emo|emotions]]. Now living in Finland (a place he is constantly complaining of government corruption), Wetflame has been known to appear on various internet forums to argue with whoever falls into his [[trap]].

==Wars==

It is proven fact that Wetflame like to start fights on any website that he is currently active at, including backwater internet forums, using various aliases such as IAMNOTARUMBUS, Destroyed, and Nameless_Catfish. Wetflame has graced everything from the Nuklear Power forums, to gaying up [[Habbo]] Raids, to Digg. Yes, fucking Digg, I saw him there once.

Banned, then unbanned, whining about being persecuted and soon to be banned again for having a sig that says 'NiggerCock' in some unknown foreign language. Somehow, one or two people seem to like him, though they themselves are usually [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|extremely unique individuals]] .

In 2010 Wetflame was a [[Drama_whore]] across various electronics forums under various new pseudonyms including Pink Pikachu and The Dark One. 

Wetflame is truly master of [[TL;DR|TL;DR]].

==The Madness Begins==

After [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|his initial introduction to the internet]] Wetflame become obsessed with some [[women]]. This prompted him to send a letter explaining his complex feelings to various board members. 

{{quote| Happy Christmas. I really had to send you something especially because I didn't at your birthday. I really hope we can be friends this Christmas. It would mean a lot to me. I don't want you to be mad at me. I know you keep saying how many chances you've given me but I never keep count. If a person genuinely wants to be my friend, I have no problem with it. So will you be my friend? The truth is that we've never been friends except for when we were in love. You kept count of how many times I hurt you, but did you count all the times I made you feel good inside? It makes everything seem so false when people keep count... But that sounds so mean, so I'll try to change from here on.<br><br>Anyway you've probably stopped reading but if you haven't I guess I better explain a lot of things.<br><br>Anyway, I really didn't want to hurt anyone. The problem is that I am an emotional being and I can only respond to emotions. You don't know how hard it is to totally stop talking to someone you love forever, imagine if Henry didn't want you to speak to him ever again?<br>Think about it.<br>Anyway, I can't do what's best for someone unless they show me it's really upsetting them... Being cold and hanging up on make me want to keep trying harder! Whereas if you had burst out crying and told me I was doing wrong as I did it and not after when it's too late.<br>I'm very sorry about trying to change you, you're fine the way you are. I have a very bad hair fetish...|Wetflame}}

==Banned from Sonic Fanboy site==
After posting too much tl;dr, and bullshit Drama, it seems even the Admins were tired of him.  Therefore they hold a special charity event, where the puspose was to donate has much $$$ has they can in order to [[lie|properly]] get rid of him along with some other black person.  Here's a transcript of this lulzy event.

Later Wetflame being the [[Drama_whore]] he is made tl;dr post about how [[lie|unfair]] retro was with him, basicly replace anyother tl;dr from him with a few names from the IRC trancript and you know all the shit that sheman spewed from his [[ass|orifice]].

==Wetflame's Posts about Internet Fascism==

{{quote| I'm sitting here thinking "What the fuck", after I got banned for 2 weeks, for my first offense, telling a mod to "Fuck off, seriously" after he took on what I perceived to be quite a narky tone; "WE DON'T WANT TO READ ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL SHIT" when I was trying to explain some background information as to why it was pretty urgent that I find a particular kind of broadband. In general, I was bitching about the terrible internet we have in Ireland, sharing my experience of it. So it REALLY set me off that he said that.

I have Aspergers Syndrome and my particular form of it tends to manifest itself in extreme difficulty with online communications; getting overly aggressive at not being able to get a point across. It's difficult to help this. Since the internet is rule based and not logic based - it refuses to take this into account; refuses to acknowledge that it's not fair to hold me to the same standards. I do have ISSUES. But those issues wouldn't be so big if it wasn't for the bigger issue - OTHER PEOPLE. Other people are jackasses.

At least Judge Dredd tends to judge people who actually do things wrong. Opposing the institution, whether it be "official" of a set of clique-ish notions, even aggressively, is not "wrong". Yet it will get you banned FAR more often than genuine, malicious trolling(which most of these forums deserve, directed towards the mods). Even if someone claims they can do what they like with their property, that's still WRONG and it should be DISCOURAGED.

I think a lot of this has to do with a bit of a conservative backlash; mindlessly upholding "Amerikan" values over all logic.

I just wish I knew how to get people to understand.|Wetflame}}

This post actually sparked [[at least 100]] pages of [[lulz]] on one forum he posted it on, and has since turned into delicious [[copypasta]].

==What People Are Saying About Wetflame==
[[Image:A_RAPE_SPIDER_kangajew.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"What the fuck is that supposed to be?" -rapespider]]
<i>This is so stupid. Last night I had a dream I was in school and Wetflame (who looked like a scrawny, blond haired, blue eyed ugly kid in the dream) was next to me. He kept trying to hit on me and touch me in ... err bad places and stuff. He'd like... rub my butt when I'd bend over to pick something up, and I think once he tried to lick me... so finally I yelled at him and said I'd sue him for sexual harrasment if he didn't stop.

If I recall, he did stop too and I remember being dissapointed because I really wanted to sue him.</i>

:~[[attention whore|Sonique Hedgehog]]

<i>I do have a theory that it might be Wetflame, though. I made the mistake of attempting to be sympathetic towards him, and it came back to bite me in the ass when he entered NiD's irc chat and made a total ass of himself. He then called me a backstabber because I didn't support him pestering and irc-molesting* some of my friends as well as quoting Epi Avd every ten seconds after Phage gave him a well-deserved ban.</i>

:~Elbot Wolfcat

<i>Wetflame, just shut the fuck up and go away. No one likes you at this site, no matter how many proxies you use.</i>

:~IUG

<i>I love this shit. Wetflame. I'll have you know, within ten minutes of discovering the existence of Sonic Cult, and Sclassic, I had figured out Wetflame just might be legally a fucktard.</i>

:~blamemyparents

<i>and wetflame joins in. Time for the usual "read right past" stuff.</i>

:~Pachuka/Reala

<i>Wetflame pisses me off. Alot.</i>

:~Slash

<i>What the fuck is that supposed to be?</i>

:~[[User:Sokevinsays|A RAPE SPIDER]]

<i>Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahah</i>
:~[[User:MopHead|MopHead]]

<i>I really tried to be friends with you, but you just kept on fucking up. I'm not sorry.</i>
:~[[User:Madmantyke|Fiz]]

<i>If there was ever an example of how Michael Jackson could be even more fucked up, it is in the face, mind, and ability to communicate with human beings which is WetFlame</i>
:~[[User:Chovy|Chovy]]

<i>BAWWWWWWWWWWWW</i>
:~WetFlame

<i>What the hell is that?  Oh fuck! It's a guy. Hey! Look! Holy shiiiit, that's fuckin' creepy.</i>
:~A lot of people living in Finland.

==What Wetflame has to say about this article==

{{quote|Hah, what the fuck is this? Took their time, but that just makes it grave digging. Seriously, what the fuck? I don't even go to [[Sonic_CulT|Sonic Cult]] anymore, nor is it very nice to make fun of someone who was as emotionally [[aspie|fucked up]] as I was - but hell, ED is all about destroying people, it's not as if it's telling the truth when it claims it's a "parody" site(which it can't be if it posts "real" personal information as this page does).

I would also like to point out that the guys making this article are two of the head honcho worshippers of PACHUKA - convicted [[moot|child rapist]] and non-convicted extortionist, from whom they get their BADASS attitude.

I don't [[molest|touch]] you anymore. Why the fuck do you feel the need not just to let me get on with my "[[retardation|Thing]]" away from your amoral cesspit? Why don't people realise that ED isn't "for the Lulz" at all, and is edited by people who either have worse social skills than I ever had, or are genuinely quite [[awesome|evil]] and [[intelligent|manipulative]] people?

It really isn't your place to "[[fuck|expose]]" me like that if I'm using the name Kittie Rose on other sites, it should be my right to privacy. If you HAVE to take the piss out of me, do it under the name Wetflame, don't link to my fucking myspace/DA/Masters of Fackin shit or whatever else which has nothing to do with anything, and I won't care. But I do forget that ED is all about not caring about other people!

[[butthurt|Why the hell do you feel the need to do this?]]

Though the sheer level of [[fag|homo]]/[[transsexual|transphobia]] in this topic(and this entire site) does confirm for me that the people that hated me weren't much more than sad twats.

Again, the editors of this are paedophile friendly but yet somehow don't like [[tranny|trangendered]] people. This confuses me.|Wetflame}}
