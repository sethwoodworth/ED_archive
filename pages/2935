File system
[[Image:Spantree.jpg|thumb|A simple file system.]]
A '''file system''' is a system used for files. There are many different types of systems to use, but none of them are very good for [[lulz]]. Pretty much the only way to produce lulz using file systems is to put [[Windows]] [[XP]] on FAT32.

Dorks on [[YouTube]] like to make videos about file systems for some reason [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=file+system&search=Search].

==Types of Filesystems==
There are many types of filesystems, and there have been [[at least 100]] produced [[at least 100 years|within the past 100 years]]. Here are all of them, except for the shittest types, which are only used by garptards
