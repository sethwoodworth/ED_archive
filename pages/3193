GOBBLES
{{SecurityFaggotry}}
GOBBLES is the greatest group of [[troll]]s that have ever existed. Their drama-generating techniques used were truly of far greater magnitude than anything that has been seen since. The skill and grace with which they whipped the entire whitehat security industry into a frothing, hateful rage make even hardened masters of trollery like the [[GNAA]] look retarded and inefficient.

GOBBLES was such a master of trollery that songs will be sung of their feats for many generations of trolls to come.

==Who is/are GOBBLES?==
GOBBLES Security is an off-again on-again group of about 20 [[hackers]] who look for exploitable code and security flaws with all sorts of internet related programs. GOBBLES has found critical flaws in many different programs, including:
*Cherokee Webserver
*CSS
*[[Java]]
*[[OpenBSD]] servers running [[Apache]]
*[[UNIX|NTOP]]
*The [[MP3]] file format (see [[GOBBLES#MP3 Hydra]])
*Hushmail
*IRCit IRC Client

GOBBLES is infamous for their no-heads up "Vendor Notifications" which serve as a massive "[[Fuckyou|Fuck You]]" to the company who's product is being [[Rape|worked around]]:
{{quote|The professional staff of GOBBLES Security believe that by releasing our advisories without vendor notification of any sort is cute and humorous, so this is also the first time the vendor has been made aware of this problem. We hope that you're as amused with our maturity as we are. ;PpPppPpPpPPPpP|GOBBLES Security}}

==MP3 Hydra==
In 2003, GOBBLES caused an internet-wide panic when they announced that they were working with the [[RIAA]] to make a [[Spyware|hydra]] that had already propagated to all corners of the internet, infecting some 95% of [[p2p]] networks. Furthermore they said that the exploit was [[Your resistance only makes my penis harder!|totally uncatchable using normal means]].

[[Security Faggots]] the world over proceeded to [[shit bricks]] and [[Delete fucking everything|delete all their music]] from their computers, only to have GOBBLES come out a week later saying that it was all an [[I did it for the lulz|elaborate hoax]]. They also pointed out a security vulnerability in the file format itself that allowed for the insertion of code to delete things from Unix-based systems.

{{quote|The only excuse we can offer for our immaturity is that we like the fame|GOBBLES Security talking to <i>[[Wired]]</i>}}

This has also served to smear GOBBLES name through the muck, so that when they release their next security warning the world will ignore them and pay the penalty.

GOBBLES' more infamous troll targets included [[Theo de Raadt]], Alfred Huger, and Michal Zalewski (aka lcamtuf). He asked whitehat 'security expert' [[Raven]] what she was doing working in security when she couldn't even keep her own laptop from being [[pwn]]ed at schmoocon.

== Weev Gettin' "Tree'd" (though not really...) ==

On Sept. 15th 2009, weev was semi-[[dox|dox'd]] on the notorious [[goatse|Full-Disclosure]] mailing list.[http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/Sep/0167.html (link)]

{{quote|lol buddy i put my name in my own fuckin' blog its not like youve discovered some big secret

also, i lol that it took the worlds most [[waco|well funded law enforcement agency]]

you dudes are [[fail|sad.]]

In essence, GOBBLES gets their name from what [[updownmostly|they like to do to boys cocks]], just like those faggots in [[myg0t|zf0]]. It's not even really a "tree" because his dox [[fail|are not]] in a [[unix|tree format.]]
