Cookies
'''Cookies''' are sweet, delicious treats. Although not as [[Portal|beloved]] as [[cake]]s, the main advantage of cookies is that there can be five in a package. Cookies are baked with sugar, [[flower]], and [[The Matrix|love]] ([[^__^]]). Cookies are the most sought-after objects of the [[Internets]]. Whenever cookies are mentioned, one can expect the Cookie Monster, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], or even Dexter to make an appearance.

==Varieties==
===Browser cookies===
Not all cookies have to be neat, tasty treats; they can be [[But Data does not weight|tiny, weightless bits of data]] as well. '''HTTP cookies''', or '''browser cookies''', are tracking bugs that infest your computer's browser and cache. Websites may use them to see if you visit their site or track unique visits. Websites may also use cookies for authentication, tracking your session, or keeping you logged in to a site for weeks.

Most sites need cookies to be enabled in order to function, especially if you're planning to log in. Unfortunately, most users manage their cookies or their cache. These people, for one reason or another, don't know how to enable or disable cookies. These people never touch their browser's Preferences or Options ''unless'' they're planning to [[doing it wrong|do something wrong]]. They don't even know how to clear their cache or browsing history.

Although cookies could be used to spy and annoy you, cookies are not that harmful. Despite this, people disable cookies anyway and forget how to re-enable them. Cookies aren't [[viruses]]. They can destroy your privacy, but they can't destroy software or your computer. Simply keep them enabled and start clearing your cache every once in a while.

===Fortune cookies===
'''Fortune cookies''' are mystic treats that supposedly contain answers to your future. These fortunes are less cryptic than those created by [[Nostradamus]], but they're also less likely to ever happen. They were created by [[Asian]] [[Americans]] in order to [[profit]] from [[ramen]]-eating [[weeaboos]] who seek "authentic" [[Whaling|Asian cuisine]]. Fortune cookies also tend to contain the supposed winning numbers to the [[gambling|lottery]]. Recently, however, fortune cookies began to stop offering fortune and to provide [[advice]] and [[bullshit|ancient Chinese proverbs]] instead.

[[Protip]]: Point out to [[weeaboos]] that fortune cookies were invented in [[Texas]].

===Cookie Monster===
{{Quote|"C" is for "cookie"; that's good enough for me.|Cookie Monster}}
{{Quote|Cookies are a sometimes food.|Cookie Monster in denial}}

Cookie Monster has generally been viewed as a [[huggle|lovable, huggable]] creature. Cookie Monster is so named due to his fierce and beastly love for cookies and all things sweet. He's been on [[Sesame Street]] since Day 1, and for most of that time, there wasn't any complaining. Cookie Monster introduced several generations to humor and created the {{Youtube|BovQyphS8kA|"C" is for Cookie}} song.

Recently, however, things changed. Over 60% of [[Americans]] were [[fat]] and sloppy. [[Concerned mother|Concerned, Christian mothers]] began to look for a [[scapegoat]]. Someone or something had to be responsible, but it couldn't be themselves. It had to been some evil, foreign influence. It had to be from [[TV]] or [[video games]]; it couldn't be from [[enabler]]s such as themselves. These parents blamed Cookie Monster and flooded Sesames Street's human resources department with complaints.

In response, the Sesame Street executives forced Cookie Monster to cut down on cookies. Cookies became a "sometimes food"; now, he eats [[fruit]]s first. Sesame [[fanbois]] then attacked the Sesame Street executives for turning him into a so-called '''Veggie Monster'''. Cookie Monster denies these claims and claims that he would eat (almost) anything.

===Arnold Schwarzenegger===
{{Main|Arnold Schwarzenegger}}
{{Quote|Put that cookie down! [[Nao]]!|Arnold Schwarzenegger}}

After doing memorable movies such as ''[[Pervert|Predator]]'' and ''[[Holocaust|Terminator]]'', Arnold decided to change his image by doing family comedies and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skBlEbsM0jM Japanese commercials]. This led to box office bombs and Internet [[win]]s such as ''[[wikipedia:Kindergarten Cop|Kindergarten Cop]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Jingle All the Way|Jingle All the Way]]''.

During the film, Arnold (portraying a [[loser]] named "Howard" [[phone]]s home in order to talk to his wife, but an [[asshole]] called "Ted" answers instead. Ted eats some cookies baked by Arnold's [[waifu]] and tells Arnold about how good they are. Arnold then yells:

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">Cookies? Who told you you could eat my cookies? Put that cookie down. NOW!</blockquote>

This was all before the Internets of course, but once the users rediscovered the film, parodies appeared everywhere (specifically [[YouTube]]).

===Dexter's Lab===
{{Quote|Dexter's a cookie.|Robo-parrot}}

'''Dexter's Lab''' was a comedic [[cartoon]] created and produced by [[Russian]] [[Jew]] Genndy Tartakovsky and shown on Cartoon Network. This show featured a [[indigo child|boy genius]] called Dexter and his childish sister Dee-Dee. In a particular episode called "The Parrot Trap", Dexter creates a parrot that mimics anything it hears. Due to interference from Dee-Dee, the parrot annoys Dexter, and Dexter bashes it up. This leads to the parrot going haywire and saying things such as "DEXTER'S A COOKIE", "DEXTER'S A STUPID GIRL", "SMOOTH MOVE DEXTER", "DEXTER'S SECRET", "THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES", and "WORMS AND PLASTIC MINNOWS". This is often parodied and remixed in [[YouTube]] videos.
