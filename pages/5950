"'''Oh god, what have I done?'''" or "'''What have I done?'''", also known as "'''Regretful Man'''" is a relatively [[Forced Meme|new minor meme from those copy-pasting fuckheads]] from [[/b/|the internet hate machine]]. Very similar in premise to [[Rage|fffffff]], the idea is basically 3 panels of mental lapse and the shocking reveal: regret. The overtly sexual nature of damn near every image in the gallery exposes the average [[/b/tard]] for what they really are: fuck-ups and sexual deviants.
