: '''Usage Notes:'''
:: a. Should you pause to think before retorting, your reply—no matter how clever—falls to the level of common insult and you fail it. (It is zing.)
:: b. A zing must be quick, calculated, and articulate, and have no flaws in its logical or figurative consistency.

: '''Etymology:''' English, onomatopoeia, from the sound of a ricocheting projectile (e.g. bullet).

: '''Origin:''' The term "[[burn]]" was [[old meme|overused]], and therefore had died. From its ashes rose several new terms, such as [[snap]], and zing. To be zing is bliss, and neverending once you have it.

: '''Errata:''' The Zing King, or King of Zing, is currently [[faggot|jameth]], who has not yet found a match for his [[faggotry|talents]]. Like the Dalai Llama, he is [[retarded|all-knowing]] in his [[Shit nobody cares about|art]].

: '''Synonyms:''' see [[pwn|PWN]], wit.
