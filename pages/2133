An all-around humorous topic, and the ultimate escape from your [[bantown|flesh prison]], although usually resulting in thinking that you will be reincarnated and [[Unrealistic expectations|being disappointed]]. There are many types of '''death''', but these are all just the ultimate form of [[pwning]] from God as described below. A common way to refer to death [[OTI]]  is being [[IRL banned]].

There are [[Toyota|many ways]] of achieving death, some [[An Hero|funnier]] than [[AIDS|others]]. Death is unique as it is the only common ground human beings have. So remember that the next time some jerk beats you up, steals your bike, fucks your mother and makes you call him Cindy, you have a comeback (albeit a shit one) which is: "'''LOL NIGGA JOO GUNNA DIE!'''"

Think of the world as one huge fucking forum, with God as the admin. Thousands of people are [[banned]] everyday, but there are also thousands of registered new users everyday so it balances out. Except in [[China]], where the mods seem less strict. However, not everyone is [[permabanned]] by God. Some people simply [[Suicide|delete their own IRL accounts]].

<center><b>Death is not synonymous to being [[Murder|killed]].</b></center>

==E-Death==
A fake death involving an [[Internet celebrity]], and thus not to be taken seriously. E-Deaths are attempted by [[attention whore|attention whores]] who think that people will actually [[Unrealistic Expectations|miss them when they're gone.]] It is but one more way for these failures to fool themselves into believing that they will not be [[dying alone]].

On teh Interweb, sometimes "death" is represented by the symbol [[evil|â€ ]]. This is ubar laem and ttly an [[Unfunny|OLD MEME]].

===[[Lie|Notable]] Fakes===
An actual attempt at faking one's death for reasons other than [[Lollercaust|millions of laughs]]. A simple but incredibly effective (in a sufficiently [[retard]]ed community, that is) type of [[attention whore|attention whoring]].
*[[Sui-Chan]] - Infamous emo "live" fake death.
*[[Kewllimesrevenge]] - The fake death that never happened.
*[[Flashman]] - Fake death of a fake person.
*Limeybean - Yet another drama-ful fake death on the Internets.
*[[The Great Sonic-cide of 2007]] - The grand lulz of fake deaths.
*[[Perfection_Girl|Perfection Girl]] - DEAD OR ALIVE?!
*[[Patrick Swayze]] is rumored to be dead of butt cancer but still lives, according to his agent.
*[[PogoRoo]] - Faked death to scam furries out of commission money.

==Real Death==
[[Image:Vultureseatingcorpse.jpg|thumb|Death is delicious]]
The actual death of an actual person. While usually funnier than a [[fake death]], it nevertheless might not be [[Holocaust|completely awesome]]...depending on [[Kill it with fire|how they died]]. The death of your ex-girlfriend is probably not funny because she probably doesn't exist. On the other hand, the old guy with cancer who chartered a biplane and jumped out is pretty much [[A Plus|A+]]. Or when [[Steve Irwin]], who spent his life pissing off crocodiles and other large animals, got im-fucking-paled by a stingray. Also, the death of any [[an hero]] is sure to create [[lulz]]. There is something called the [http://www.darwinawards.com/ Darwin Awards] which is a great source of [[lulz]] while making [[mundane|other people]] think you are fucked up for finding it funny. Real death is a Necrophiliac's dream, and they will make sweet (most likely [[furry]]) love to any festering meat pile.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgbqp4aKCbA Full version here]<br>'''It is believed that there have been a total of 100 billion human beings that have ever lived on the Earth. Subtract the five billion+ alive today, leaves 95 billion persons that have experienced death. Of those, this is probably the most unique set of circumstances resulting in death.'''
