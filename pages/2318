How many of you love '''Dogs'''?  Your [[bestiality|best friend]], [[buy a dog|your protector]], etc.  [[GodJesus]] said in Mathew 7:15-16 to beware of a wolves in sheeps' clothing--do you know what he referred to?  That's right, dogs!  Dogs are wolves that were selectively bred since 100,000 BC by Satan ([[creationism|since people didn't exist till 6000BC]]) and then bred by humans since 6000BC to appear like little sheep.  But inwardly dogs are ravenous wolves.

Dogs love to:
* Scare [[you|people]]
* Attack [[you|people]]
* Smell like rotting [[crap|garbage]]
* If the dog big enough, then eat young children
* If the dog any size, then [[vore|eat whatever is smaller than it]]
* Bark at 150 decibels like a broken record 24/7 nonstop
* [[Rape]] humans, including young [[children]]
* [[Coprophagia|Eat feces]]
* Eat their own regurgitation

And all the while because of their sheep disguise it's illegal to shoot them, poison them, do pet dressing, or even have sex with them. And of course, dog sex is the best. In fact, according to a recent study, having sex with dogs is shown to increase midiclorian count. If somebody walks in [[accidentally]] on you in the middle of the act, many [[lulz]] are bound to ensue, because the dog penis locks inside whatever orifice it has been put into for at least an hour and a half. Of course, you'll never get any dog pussy because you are [[you]], and therefore, you [[fail]] at life. And have a small [[penis]].

==Dog hunting==
You can't shoot dogs, that is, ''unless'' they're "coyotes", which are mostly dog but aren't completely [[retarded]] and can survive in the wild.  Then you can blast away at them 24 hours a day and the animal freaks can't give you shit about it.  Of course, Americans don't know how to cook them, but Cantonese cooks can make anything taste good.  Whether you enjoy the meat or not, it's nothing compared to the priceless expression when you invite over the [[PETA]] [[fags|members]] and they see all those heads mounted on the wall!

==Working With Dogs==

[[You]] can make some dough off this much [[raeped|beloved]] family [[furry|pet]]. 

* Vet: A wonderful profession where you will have the chance to [[bestiality|stick thermometers up dog's asses]], be exposed to [[Aids|multiple diseases that can be passed from animals to humans]] and be privy to Fido's daily bathroom schedule. Get paid [[at_least_100|a buttload]] of [[money]] by prescribing [[drugs]] meant for humans at twice the price to fucktard owners. On the plus side you get to [[pwn|put dogs down]]. 

* Groomer: A [[shit|great]] alternative if [[you]] are too [[stupid]] to pass Med school for animals. You'll have a fun-filled day of being [[guro|slashed]] bloody by newly cut nails, cleaning around Fido's ass and listening to the yapping of small purse dogs owned by [[whores|prominent female celebrites]]. You won't get paid fuck all, but the fun part is making dogs looking even more fucking [[retarded]] than they already are. 

* Trainer: Make shitloads of cash on people too fucking lazy/[[retarded]] to teach their own pet basic commands. 

* Police : Train big fucking dogs to maul [[niggers|criminals]].

* Breeder: Dogs need human help doing such natural things as [[fucking]]. Make [[Profit]] from purebreds and make even [[moar]] by mating two different types of dogs together to create a fun new hybrid with the worst traits of both parents.

==Did you know?==
Other species keep pets too.  Ants tend to beautiful lycaenid caterpillars night and day.  Birds keep [[cocks|cuckoo]]s, who grow larger and larger and more and more demanding, giving the parent birds endless entertainment.  ''"Awww, did my little cuckoo knock that egg out of the nest?  ''Bad cuckoo.''  Let me get you a snack!"''  Like dogs do for humans with a breeder instinct, cuckoos give birds a fulfilling alternative to parenthood.
