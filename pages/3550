A h8r is a truly pathetic soul who [[h8]]s merely for [[teh]] sake of h8in'. This person has no [[Internet Politics|political]] agenda, and no [[religion|religious motives]]; their only goal in life is to h8 on people. Please note that using the word "hater" or "h8er" in a normal conversation will brand you as either a [[13-year old boy]], [[nigra]], [[wigger]] or [[assburgers]] retard. Also, it's a well-known fact that being hated on by a h8r [[Haters Make Me Famous|will totally make your famous]].
==Types==
The people described as "H8ers" can be classified into two distinct groups.

*[[Anonymous]] - who [[IDIFTL|does it for the Lulz]] and never refers to himself as a "hater".
*[[angst]]y [[teen]]s - All are part of [[The LiveJournal Circle Jerk]].  These h8rs tend to h8 the player more than they h8 the game, and do it because they are [[butthurt]].

It is well known that h8ers only consume h8rade.
