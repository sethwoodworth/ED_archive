You know that guy who always shows up uninvited to parties? The guy who spouts off jokes he heard on network sitcoms? The guy who thinks every woman is crazy over him?

That's [[you]], and guess what?

'''No one likes you'''

[[No one]] has ''ever'' liked you.

All those friends you had? [[YTMND|They made fun of you behind your back]]. Every group of friends does this.

* All your edits are reverted
* You are [[gline]]d from [[ED IRC]]
* This has been put on your Talk Page:
{{clear}}
{{unwelcome}}

[[Image:BenderBCClub.jpg|thumb|right|You could disappear tomorrow and it wouldn't make any difference]]
Well, it's easy to say [[Mitchell Henderson|Go Kill Yourself And Then You Will Be Such An Hero]], but to tell you the truth, if No One Likes You now, then everyone will be glad you died. If you care about the rest of the world and weren't so goddam selfish, then you would do yourself in. Because it would make us all very happy.

*Start a [[Columbine|school shooting]] or go on a killing spree and aim for the high score

*[[Vandalism|Edit]] [[ED]]
*[[Troll]]
*[[Fap|???]]
*[[Raptor Jesus|Profit]]!
