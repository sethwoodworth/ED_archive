== Zeriara Ramirez, the name ==

Zer tried to claim that her fursona's name was an acronym (dumb bitch meant anagram) of "Ramirez." However, there is only one 'A' in Ramirez, and no 'M' in Zeriara. Mississippi's education system rears its ugly head once again.

Earlier, however, she tried to claim that it was a mash-up of two The Lion King characters: Zira and some other furry piece of shit she wanted to [[rape]].

== Place of Origin for Holly Massey == 

For several years now, Zeriara has tried to make herself seem like the southern belle of the [[Furry art|furry fandumb]], possibly to make herself appear even more [[Attention whore|unique.]] Unfortunately for her, she's only managed to succeed in making herself seem even more like trailer park [[Redneck|redneck white trash]]. She also likes to claim she's from places like [[New Orleans]] or the Everglades, which she's done on her [http://birdeggsyum.deviantart.com birdeggsyum] and [http://seminolewind.deviantart.com seminolewind] DA accounts. In reality, she's from the shithole Meridian, [[Mississippi]], far away from any real swampland, and with some of the lamest education in the US. There she is known as the "[[Blowjob]] Queen of the South." She was last seen in Indiana, giving head and gargling cum for kind comments on her shitty art.

==ART, continued==

'''Things She "Owns"'''

Since everyone in the world wants a piece of her [[faggotry]], she has quickly established what is hers and what you SHOULD ''NEVER EVER'' TOUCH OR EVEN THINK ABOUT.  According to her, she is the genius who thought up bi-colored eyes, back scars (and scars in general), albinism, insanity, [[sXe]], beauty marks (and beauty in general), [[angst]], fluffy koala ears, lemurs, gore, inverted crosses, spitting/vomiting/coughing/peeing blood, broken hearts, heart markings, opossums, the color green, corgis (after pagedrillgirl, at least), and the habit of slathering on eyeliner in substitution of actual eyebrows.

Don't even THINK of drawing a lemur character of your own, or Zer and all her leg-humping friends will be sure to comment on your picture on how much your character looks SO MUCH like her even if it it doesn't have the stupid fucking Koala ears. (Because all lemurs are Â© Zer, amirite?)

Hell, even if you take a fucking gasp of air, just be sure to expect her coming all the way from whatever house or shack she lives in and bitch on how you're copying her style.

----

'''Character morph'''

Although she claims to be a lemur and own koala ears, her character tends to shape-shift into everything she likes and its grandma. She drew several pages of her character's design in various animal forms, placing giant [[fag]]goty neon green watermarks on all of them, [[allegedly]] meaning, "I OFFICIALLY OWN THIS ANIMAL."

Examples of her raping the natural world:

'''MARY SUE!!  ZOMG!!'''

She creates various [[Mary Sue]]s and inserts them into any [[fan]]dom that makes her clit twitch. These characters are typically either carbon copies of her real-life self (sometimes turned albino and anorexic, which she also invented) or are little boys. 

[[Image:ITS_YO_BABY_by_zeriara.jpg|thumb|right| Throw-away fancharacter-child #4080!]]
[[Image:Hollytakescredit.jpg|thumb|left| Holly likes to take credit for virtually anything she possibly can, including obsessions/fans of the same things she is.]]

Invariably, these Mary Sues bang the villains. Often times, the little boy characters are the offspring of her persona's banging of the villain, including unpopular fan-travesty [[Faggoth|Anton Nicalls]] (sic), the son of [[Gorillaz]] bassist Murdoc Niccals and herself. If anyone she knows draws or shows any form of interest in these fandoms at the same time as Zeriara or afterward, she WILL go apeshit on them, claiming she knew about them first and loves them more. Of course, as this list testifies, her taste in fandoms is characteristically lame -- after all, this is the same person who thought that 'Lady In The Water' was one of the best movies she'd seen in years, and proceeded to brag to all of her friends that she had 'claimed' the Scrunts as 'hers'. It's only a matter of time until she sees the 'Halloween' remake, and claims to have loved the original movies for all her life. The count-down is also beginning to when she'll make a Sue for 30 Days of Night.

And somehow, even though she is obviously guilty of creating countless grody fancharacters, she '''still''' claims to hate fandom bastardization even more than mpreg.

[[Image:Fandomrapefever.jpg|thumb|left| An encyclopedia of stupidity.]]
[[Image:ZerFUGLY.jpg|thumb|right| Could this all be a case of fetal alcohol syndrome?]]
[[Image:zerpocrypsy.jpg|thumb|right| Here she calls some fan out for having Jeepers Creepers fanart, one fandom Zer is known to 'dominate'.]]
Only someone like Zeriara could turn fandom into a game of "who hates who." For example, the main reason she got into the brief Bambi obsession was to get back at her ex, Pocketbatinc (and possible one-up Uranium Husky, someone else Zer enjoys pretending to be friends with while mocking behind their back). Several days after the former displayed interest in the sequel, Zeriara spazzed out and made a massive, failed effort to draw as much fanart as possible in an attempt to make it look as if ''she'' was the one who originally liked the movie, even going so far as to make a competing LJ name (rivalstag) to 'outfan' Pocketbatinc, whose greatestjournal at the time was badass_stag). It should be worth noting that Zeriara's fan-character for Bambi was an albino deer that (presumably) banged the 'villain' of Bambi 2, Ronno. It goes without saying that within days Zeriara had forgotten that the Bambi movie was ever made (until anyone in the future makes an albino deer, in which case you can be sure she will claim to "love the movie for years" all over again).

This isn't the first time she's butchered a fandom just to overshadow someone she dislikes -- she's done it to Pocketbatinc before with Batman and [[Gorillaz]]. Her [[Gorillaz]] fannishness is particularly hilarious -- although she hadn't drawn any fanart prior to 2005 (aside from a few images over the years she'd drawn to suck up to Pacrat, who she likes "despite the fact she's a mexican"). When questioned about the origin of her fan love, she claimed she "got into them through the Tank Girl fandom." When she saw a picture of the band from 2001, she couldn't even identify Noodle (for non-fans' information, this is the 14-year-old girl that she wants to molest), saying that Noodle's previous design must be "a totally different character."

==Tattoos==
[[Image:Pussybitch.jpg|thumb| HOLD MEH HAND OMGZ THE PAENE WRYYYYY.]]
Holly has never been one to get particularly clever tattoos, or even tattoos that wouldn't be easily regretable once she's old and wrinkled. Her skin "art" also seems to carry the trend of looking as though someone scribbled them onto her with a Sharpie marker - due in part to her shitty choice of tattoo artists, and her shittier choice of tattoo designs. 

It is also debatable whether she has ever even paid for any of the tattoos she has, again jumping at any opportunity to let others finance what she ought to do herself. There's a difference between accepting hospitality, and just straight out taking advantage of people's generosity. But so long as Holly benefits, she doesn't care.

Her face has also collected various hunks of metal over the years. Apparently the broad thrives on tackiness.

She was aspiring to be a tattoo artist for a while, until she got a glimpse at cold and hard reality: not everyone is willing to put up with her abuse and childish behavior.  Not only did the man she was apprenticing under kick her out, he hired Chival instead. Zer freaked out at Chival and kicked her out, resulting in yet another one of their lovers' spats. 

'''List of body art:'''

*Cuttlefish on her left hip, design by Grimmorph.
*"Born to Die" broken heart in the same likeness of Murdoc's tattoo from the cartoon band Gorillaz.
*Stitched heart on her breast, design by Grimmorph.
*Stitch scars on her shoulderblades.
*Upside down cross on right arm. ''(Remember guys, SPIRITUALLY she's had this tattoo for years, so she totally did it first. And apparently she humbles herself before God... since that's what the symbol represents.)  Obviously had it before she discovered who Murdoc from Gorillaz was. Obviously.''
*Octopus on her right hip, design by Panda
*Stitched-shut buttcunt tattoo on her lower abdomen, all the way down the groin

==THE DRAMA==

[[Image:DRAMAicon.jpg|thumb|right| There is not a more accurate icon to depict Zeriara in existence.]]
[[Image:ZerHissyfit.jpg|thumb|left|Jesus H. Christ, [[lolcano]].]]

Like the warning says, one of Zeriara's favourite pastimes has always been, and will always be, drawing [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Zeriara/ImageGalleries#Hate_art_drawn_by_Zer hate art] for friends, lovers, fans and enemies alike.  Should you happen across some new tidbit of red-marker-soaked spastic [[internet tough guy]]ism, be sure to save it and bring it on down here for everyone to enjoy!

Obviously, Zeriara is most notable for her long [[flame wars]] with artists all over the [[Internets]] in various archival websites spanning across VCL, Side 7, FurAffinity, and DeviantArt.

Her boasting, relentlessly blind fans, and pushy behavior have actually induced several artists to leave the [[Internets]] (or at the very least, to go insane). 

Zeriara ultimately misses the days when she was [[popular]] on the internets for actually drawing vaguely well, rather than being a huge [[drama whore]]. Sadly, being a huge drama whore is all that she has these days. Her dream of becoming an omgz professional animator will never EVER come true due to her complete lack of higher education (along with talent, drive, responsibility, work ethic, and effort), so she takes this frustration out on those around her, and will continue to do so seeing as her life of cashiering in a [[porn]] store is hardly a satisfying achievement, [[amirite]]? And the only reason Zer clung so tightly to Kaku is because he wants to become an animator.  In fact, their entire relationship was probably just Zer's desperate, failed attempt to ride his coat-tails into a job opportunity. However, any of us who have seen Zer's choppy, misshapen animated gifs know that this will never happen.

'''Zer responds to ED'''

She claims to have never given two shits about this article or even to have read it, but as we know, she is full of [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/User_talk:Girlvinyl/Archive_02#I_was_wondering lies.]  Zer fails.

On her new, seriously shit-faced 'art galleries' she complains about her ED entry and remarks "OH I HATE A LOT OF PEOPLE TOO BUT I SURE DON'T MAKE A WEBSITE FOR THEM." No Zer, '''you just go under anonymous LJ names to make attacks on people who refuse to lick your lard ass'''. Oh, and don't forget [http://www.deviantart.com/view/30310948/ posing as one of your own fans and harassing people.] Not to mention the DeviantArt charades...

Recently, Zer has decided to further her responses to ED through... well, basically, every way she can possibly blow out her ass. She's drawn pictures, used the memes, made ever so subtle references to us in her journal, used altered hate art for icons, and she's even received fanart in relation to this little article.

You could sum it up to Zer taking it in her stride and being a good sport, but since we know that it is painfully obvious that this shit actually bothers her and doubly that good sportmanship is impossible for her, that notion is complete bunk. [[loser|Anyone]] who attempts to deny she's being a whineass about it may care to look at the fact that she failed all over [[girlvinyl]]'s user talk page about us.

What we can bet is actually the case is that Zer is obsessing over her humble little (read: fuckin' hueg) ED article in such a "good sport" manner to mask the fact she's bothered to hell about it. But then, I could be wrong.. I mean, she only references to us every chance she gets, and if she's not doing that she's either whining about the whole thing or pulling another rant from her ass. Oh, no, wait, she does more than that--she generates petty dramas like leaving FA and referencing [http://community.livejournal.com the Zeriara Fan Club] every other upload. How could we forget?

All in all, Zer is truly a creature of great ego. What other artist can you name that would take hate art and make themselves an icon with it?  Whether it's a personal or a creative low, one thing's for sure--it's pathetic. And of course, only she would obsess this much over the interapes. Oh, Zer, you never fail to be such an amazing lulzcow.

After the trail she's levt, how the girl ever expected karma to not come around, rip off her head, and shit down her throat is beyond all of us. Throughout the years, she has deserved every screenshot and paragraph in this article.
May she continue to reap the fruits of her omgzraep for many years to come.

==The Copyright Warz==

[[Image:Zers auction of others art.jpg|thumb|left| Her recent auction that was so "oddly" removed by Furbid staff. Note the characters that do not belong to her.]]

[[Image:ZerContemptStolen.jpg|thumb|right| Yet another obvious jab at Grimmorph.]]

[[Image:Lulzontheforo-zer.jpg|thumb|left| REAL artists don't steal. Lulz]]

[[Image:ZERCRAP.JPG|thumb|right| Where, oh where does she get her ideas?]]

[[Image:Lolresemblance.PNG|thumb|left| Hey.. I think I've seen this before...]]

[[Image:You_just_got_zerd.jpg|thumb|left| It finally happens.]]

Because she pinches off loaf after loaf of one-dimensional, forgettable characters and flushes her gallery due to drama shortly after, no one can be expected to remember any of them -- and usually, neither can she until by chance, someone creates a character that's of the same species or has so much as one similar feature or a matching name. At that point, she'll suddenly remember the turd of a character, post 4300 shoddy images in her galleries, and claim it's a "very old character" that's been "close to her heart for years."

In short, you just can't win with her. At one point it had even gotten so bad that she was persecuting people who created albino characters of any species. The most hilarious instance was when someone drew a picture of an actual albino lemur that had been born at a zoo -- Zer was not amused by this, and sent several of her charade accounts to harass the person.

Just because she doesn't like being copied, it doesn't mean she can't copy other people.  You can view more examples of her rip-offs [[#Things_Zer_has_Ripped_Off|'''here''']].

What's sad is that Zer has convinced herself that she's not copying anyone, but rather taking an idea and running with it, so to speak. It seems to be the case that any time she sees an idea she wishes she'd come up with, she finds some excuse to alter the idea with some minute detail and claim originality for it. At the core of it all, she just wants the attention she gets for these ideas and constantly seeks out approval from others for these ideas, even if the concepts and designs are not entirely her own. 

Though she says she doesn't care what others think of her, it's fairly obvious that it means a great, vast, ENORMOUS amount to her, because the bottomless pit of her self-esteem and ego must be fed by ignorant and easily manipulated fans. Sound a little [http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/3700/3795.asp?index=9743 histrionic] to you? In fact, the disorder could probably explain why Zer is the way she is; the linked page describes her to a T. Now let's wait and see if she if she catches on and figures she can use it as an excuse. [[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Image:Omfzerdisease.jpg Oh wait...]] 
So, technically, we're all making fun of someone with a mental disorder.
It just makes it that much more sad and hilarious all at once.

== ZER vs. [[Snapesnogger]] ==

For a while Zer's whole world revolved around flaming [[Snapesnogger]] underneath various Deviantart accounts before being banned, then denying it on her journals. Oddly enough, they are so much alike in whininess and similarities in crap art and fanbase that [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:JustMarriedcopy.jpg some people believe they should marry]. Zer appears to be most upset with [[Snapesnogger]] because she had no idea who Zer is on the internets. Apparently, Zeriara was mad for being called "ugly lemur drawing girl," so she made a deviantART account with that name and immediately got it banned for spamming.

==Zer vs. Other Cunts==

[[Image:nonose.jpg|thumb|right| Snapesnogger stole the idea of having [[Final Fantasy Tactics|no noses]] on her characters from Zer. This pissed her off more than anything.]]
One of Zeriara's claims to fame, [[Reno Maxwell|Rensis Schmitt/Reno Maxwell]] is what started it all when he/she/it either sent an e-mail to Zer requesting an art trade or emailed Zer asking if he/she/it could draw fan art of her Bassist character Funshine (no one knows for sure which one is the real story). The full details of her response are unknown,  but it was something to the extent of "NO the last thing I want you to do is draw for me. You'll KILL anything you draw." 

During years of drama circle jerks between the two, Zer made a character by the name of Skihi, an almost-direct copy of Rensis' character. For Rensis' lackeys and those who don't have their heads wedged into the bottomless abyss of Zer's ass, the similarities are very clear, but to this day Zer has gotten away with the theft and still posts tons of [[shit|pictures]] of the character to this day.

A prime example of Zer's hypocrisy are the problems she claims to have with Reno. Zer's exes Kaku and Pocketbatinc, and her so-called friends and (former) idols [[Jax the Bat]], [[HMO]], Panda(?), and Psychodjinn are all female-to-male transgenders. This poses no problems at all (at least, until she feels like being [[butthurt]]), but Reno being male/female/both/Giraffe is just too much for Zer. Almost every piece of hate art has something to do with the contents of Reno's pants. Unfortunately for her, her desperate attempts to grab Reno's attention have been failing worse than Ashton Kutcher's acting. As it stands, Zer is the only one that's interested in Reno's gender.

For his own part, Reno seems to have completely lost interest in the feud and now keeps to his own corner of the [[Internets]], despite Zur's repeated attempts to re-spark their fire by posting [[over 9000]] crappy rip-off pictures to her many galleries.

== DevianTART ==
[[Image:OmfgWTFdone1.jpg|thumb|right| Oh yeah she totally does not miss DA]] 
[[Image:ZeronDA.jpg|thumb|left| Zer totally doesn't need DeviantArt... Yeah, right.]]

This used to be Zeriara's main way of spreading her drama, but unfortunately for her, times have changed. She is now permanently banned from the website, and spends her days updating her [[LiveJournal]] and her [[furfag|FurAffinity]] with pointless rambling or asking for cash. She also tends to complain on FurAffinity about how no one comments on her pictures. WELL GEE, I wonder why? ''Bear in mind'' she deletes any pictures when someone points out a striking similarity to another character she's ripped or otherwise criticizes the piece, and then she has to start the comment count again at zero. This system sorta explains the whole "complete lack of higher education" up there.

[[Image:Rude.JPG|thumb|right| Zer misses the days when she could prioritize comments...]]

Before she was banned for [[faggotry]] she got into a bitch fit with a [http://rabidfreak.deviantart.com/ little teenage girl] over her weight. It all started when she uploaded yet another masterpiece conveying herself to look much like a [[Pro-Ana]] girl. Zeriara is in fact a [[fat]]ass but at the time refused to admit it. Even the [[16 year old girl]]'s boyfriend helped her to flame the fat Zer, but Holly insisted she could somehow transfer every stretch mark to another dimension, even going so far as to describe herself as a "SCRAWNY LASS." This resulted in a bunch of overweight Zer-fuckers flaming the [[troll]] on her userpage. The mission was [[abortion|aborted]]. As a [[final solution]], she commented on Zeriara's page, remarking "HI FATTY! *waves*." This resulted in a mostly one-sided argument with her ego until she gave up and reported the teenage girl, thus proving her ultimate [[maturity]].  Sadly, this example is just one of hundreds of mini-flame wars over stupid, useless [[shit|crap]] that Zer used to engage in all over DevianTART.

A permanent ban, however, has not stopped her from getting on the site she calls a failure numerous times under false accounts to start yet MORE drama. Zeriara needs DeviantART, and despite what she says about not caring, the very same day she was banned she had a ''new'' account, and once that was found out (by stupidly watching Panda, her roomate) she quickly began work on her website. Actually, SHE didn't do any work on it; she had OTHERS do it for her. Zeriara needs the Internet, and unfortunately she'll never be as big as she was on DeviantART. Like that's saying much anyway.
[[Image:Nagazer.PNG|thumb|right|...that happens to be the same as Naga Master!]]

So why was she banned? She had been perma-banned in the past for drawing child porn (her kiddy-character Anton drooling semen, actually, which she claimed was actually bubblegum); however, after she and her hordes of masses flamed the help desk, they revoked it and gave her a second chance. Zeriara has blamed Snapesnogger for her ban, claiming her single comment on a journal got her permanently banned. Does that make much sense? Didn't think so. She doesn't want people to know why she was really banned--around the time of her ban she was pissed off at Celena (pagedrillgirl) for having a world for her characters and stomping all over the [[Internets]] to harass others who also came up with this very unique concept. Even though Zeriara herself has Dembala, the ripped off world of darkness, and is the patron saint of harassing innocent upcoming artists, she could not stand this. So she "created" something called Semi Gudduss, a pun on Celena's Demi Goddesses. She invited anyone that happened to pass by her page to make one of these mockeries, and eventually the DA staff caught on after Zeriara tripped over her own lies and couldn't keep the story straight. This is what led to being banned for harassment and ended her DeviantART adventure.

== Anthrocon ==

[[Image:AKon_000.jpg|thumb|right| Zer apparently bleeds black butter around artists more talented than she is.]] 
[[Image:Steal2.jpg|thumb|left| Was the shirt loaned to her or just flat out stolen? Either way, the real owner will never see it again.]]

Reno has been subjected to Zer at Anthrocon also. In 2006 she followed him and his friends around with a camera taking pictures of them. No doubt to masturbate to later. Of course Zer was always standing at least 15 feet away, only capable of being a [[coward|tough guy on the intarweb]]. We here at ED were looking forward to them meeting again at AC07, but supposedly Zer could not make it due to lack of funds. However, she has made that claim in the past and shown up anyway--like at AC05, when she made an appearance 'under cover' in the [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:AC2005Leopard.jpg world's ugliest fursuit]--so anyone who has information on her attendance as AC07 is asked to kindly come forward on the talk page.  Here's hoping she gets banned from the only convention she can afford!

Several people online and in the furry fandumb have stated that if they DO spot Zer at Anthrocon, they'll put her in the hospital or worse. Let's just see if furries are all bark and no bite; Anthrocon 2008 is coming up next summer and the monochromatic lardass plans to attend, assuming she can leech enough cash off her somewhat disenchanted fans. Expect updates here of lulzy AC 2007 photos if someone actually did manage to capture her ugly, makeup-caked face. 

Let's just hope she doesn't attend any more [[Anthrocon]]s; I mean, how many people honestly want her there? Not to mention a few of the people she pissed off are violent and will most likely beat her fat unlovely ass to an albino bi-colored pulp. Many people at the con pretend to like her in order to avoid an overload of [[internet drama]] and death from whiny bitching.

== PAWNS IN THE EPIC BATTLE (continued) ==

'''PsychWeasel'''
[http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Psychweasel The fucker himself]
A little to lesser known buttbuddy of zer, it seems mr. weasel is either obsessed with zer's inability to draw him shitty anatomically fucked artwork, or her constant usage and preaching of marijuana. He is one of zer's come-back costumers, and often talks about her art and how he loves her so. Best example, he joined the zer-should-not-have-been-banned group on Furaffinity. What a goober.

'''Panda'''
Panda was always by zer's side, this being back in the day of zer and panda as roommates, or even as an online friendship. As of 2011, they are a couple, trying to get back together as roomates at panda's house. Most of their activities include smoking weed, smoking weed, and oh, smoking weed.

[[Image:heatherisaditz.jpg|thumb|left| Holly's sister, Heather. Hello there... cutie? Ugh.]]
*'''Heather Massey'''

Not much is known of Zer's younger sister other than that she is relatively ditzy and completely unaware of Holly's deviant sexual behavior, even though Holly has claimed in the past to have made several attempts to cure her sister of her "preppy" ways. Apparently, being a cookie-cutter prep girl is far worse than being a cookie-cutter goth piece of shit who jerks off to animal porn and little boys on the internet. At least Heather can admit to having an actual life, due to the fact that she doesn't actually waste her time trying to be e-famous amongst teenage furries.

She can be seen [http://www.myspace.com/heatherisasweetprincess  here.]  Since this article started calling attention to her she has set her profile to private and started posting more [[internet disease|flattering]] pictures of herself as her deafult photo. Zer has also been known to use pictures of her sister as profile images for her various alt's/charade accounts -- with no word to whether her sister has agreed to this or not.
They were apparently spawned by different men in typical white trash fashion.  Heather still lives with the gaping vagina that shat them both out. Oddly enough, Zer is the older of the two, apparently by about 7 or so years. Heather looks like she has about 15 years on her older sister, though.

== MOAR PlagueDoctorMD drama ==

Also known over the years as EbonyWolf, Wolfgonemad, Pocketbatinc, and now PlagueDoctorMD this [[transexual|transgendered]] artist has had his fair share of TEH DRAMAZ with Zeriara. After her second visit to the residence of the then-EbonyWolf, the friendly pair had a serious falling out. It was reported by PlagueDoctorMD that he had witnessed Zeriara kill various birds, a horny toad, and chipmunk. 

The most grotesque account was the killing of a black bird Zeriara apparently found wounded in a park. Sparing every gory detail, when she was done she had to be driven to a gas station so she could wash the blood covering her hands off. The main atrocity of this account is that she actually ripped the bird's head off and stuck things (twigs, grass, the animal's own leg) down its esophagus. 

PlagueDoctorMD also reported that Zeriara gloated about the killing later on, and not long after also killed a chipmunk by stomping on it, then proceeded to use her teeth to skin the animal. She also compared the skinned animal to a [[Resident Evil]] dog or licker or somesuch after it was skinned, and [[lol]]led about it.

After these occurrences, the friendship between PlagueDoctorMD and Zeriara was all but severed, and the [[drama]] commenced. Zeriara switched back and forth between groveling and lashing out at PlagueDoctorMD, and vague insults were passed between [[DeviantArt]] journals as well as [[blogs]].

Zeriara was a busy bee, pitting any lackey she could against her old friend, making him out to be an abusive, unloving asshole who never did nothin' for her. Except for that plane ticket he bought to pay her way on one of her visits... and a big concert he took her to... and countless fanarts of her personal character... the list goes on and on and on and on.

This resulted in total [[pwn]]age when teh dramaz took a turn for the worst. The worst for Zeriara, anyway. PlagueDoctorMD, who had mostly kept quiet while Zeriara threw tantrum after tantrum because he refused to give in to her manipulations and promises that she would change and "NEVAR KILL ANIMALS AGIN!!1 D8," finally reached the end of his rope. 

In an amazing display of logic and revealed truth, much like an Internet Apocalypse, PlagueDoctorMD responded and shot down lie after lie that Zeriara had so "artfully" smeared across her [[Livejournal]] much like a monkey flings poo (or, in this case, a lemur).

Since then, the relationship between PlagueDoctorMD and Zeriara has become the stuff of [[lulz|truly epic lulz]], leaping on a daily basis between friends and enemies.  Zeriara, jealous of PlagueDoctorMD's new-found popularity since his decision to live purely off of his commission income, tends to follow him around the [[Internets]] like a lost puppy, half-heartedly attempting to outfan any fandom he shows interest in.  Some examples of this include Bambi, Batman, Gorillaz, plague doctors, and most recently, dinosaurs.  It seems the underlying grudge may also have something to do with the fact that PlagueDoctorMD is now dating Zer's former art-idol, [http://psychodjinn.deviantart.com Psychodjinn]. Zeriara has quietly whispered that Psychodjinn is only dating him because he's [[e-popular]], but if you'll take a look at [http://plaguedoctormd.deviantart.com his] and [http://psychodjinn.deviantart.com Psychodjinn's] pageviews, you'll see that the latter easily outstrips the former in terms of popularity.  Zeriara has also drawn hate art for both of them, seen [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Zeriara/ImageGalleries#Hate_art_drawn_by_Zer here.]

PlagueDoctorMD has never once come crawling back to Zeriara (in fact, he and Psychodjinn spend a good deal of their time on the [http://community.livejournal.com/zeriara_fanclub Zeriara Fan Club] mocking her), but Zeriara must have carpet burn on her belly from the number of times she has crawled back begging for friendship. Her true insecurities always shine through when she faces the potential threat of someone calling her out for what she really is. Let's face it, folks, like [[necrophilia|sex with a corpse]], she rarely fails to disappoint.

Despite the few truces PlagueDoctorMD and Zeriara have attempted to forge, Zer can't help but screw it up again and again, most notably for trying to take credit for PlagueDoctorMD's character Marium. Marium is a blue anthro raccoon character created by [http://plaguedoctormd.deviantart.com PlagueDoctorMD] in 1999. Since his creation, Zeriara has made multiple attempts to claim the character as her own, on the grounds that she co-designed him, when in reality she only helped name him. This was back in a time when PlagueDoctorMD and Zeriara were on good terms. 

Since then, Holly seems to have dropped trying to steal Marium since his original creator totally pwned her and any friends who leapt to her ill-conceived defense.

== Her vices ==

[[Image:Olawdthefunny.jpg|thumb|Underage binge drinking is FUUUN]]
[[Image:Zernodrugsplz.png|thumb|left|Zer: INTERNETZ POLICE!]]
[[Image:POTARTLOL.jpg|thumb|left|Zer hates pot and those who use it, but fuck she'll draw anything to impress a greater artist.]]Of note is the fact that Zer has equipped her main character with red pinky fingers and toes, which is questionable since pimps or just plain crackheads often colored the pinky fingers or grew them out longer. This is a quick and easy tool to snort crack, kids! But who's paying attention?

Currently, she has a Goof Troop character named Tweaker who has been drawn wearing pot leaf clothing and holding a bag of [[drug#marijuana|weed]].  Also, throughout her online existence she has had and still has characters who smoke heavily.

Even worse than weed in Zer's eyes are cigarettes. Zer has been known to throw tantrums at friends and strangers alike about their smoking habits, holding it on the same level as heroin and cocaine. The irony in this is her pro-active drinking, which can shut down an entire organ, the liver. Alcohol totally doesn't count, though, in the world of Zer.

More reasoning behind this so-called hatred is that her father was accused of killing a man, supposedly in the middle of a drug-deal, and has been incarcerated for the greater part of Zer's life. Zer claims she does not like to discuss this issue, but you can count on her bringing it up if she ever feels the need for a pity party. At the same time, she will use her father's imprisonment as leverage to her claims of being totally badass and feels it justifies her in saying that she's had it worse than anyone she's ever come into contact with. To Zer, no one can ever know the full extent of her [[emo]]-pain, [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Zeriara/ImageGalleries#Examples_of_Zer.27s_Emo_Tendencies BUT DON'T YOU CALL HER EMO.]

Despite all this supposed seething hate for drugs and cigarettes, she frequently draws herself and her friends' [[furfag|furfag]] characters using both, and has taken commissions for similar subject matter.  [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Zeriara/ImageGalleries#Examples_of_Drug_Enthusiasm Way to stick to your guns, there, Holly...]

'''Zoophilia'''

One of Holly's lesser known fetishes, zoophilia is yet another to add to the horrifying list. It's known that she once sent a link to a furry porn site that specialized in [[Zeta toy|creating animal dildos]] to one of her now ex-girlfriends, saying she wanted to buy a wolf phallus to use as a strap-on. Is it any wonder they aren't dating anymore?

'''Racism'''

[[Image:Hollyracist.jpg|thumb|left|LOL NIGRAS ARE SCARY]]
Another irritating trait, Zeriara is racist, though it doesn't show through as often as her other delightful qualities.

She's shown interest in the band [http://www.prussianblue.net/ Prussian Blue] in the past, a [[White nationalism|white supremacist]] 14 year old duo of twin girls. We're not sure if it's the kiddy diddling urges, the racism, or a combination of the two that caused her to take interest in them.

In her eyes, the only thing that redeems black people is if they draw well and kiss her ass. Otherwise she's throwing on her sheet and grabbing some torches.


----

'''Incest Fantasies'''

What makes Holly's pedophilia less surprising is her incestual fetish. When she was 16 or 17, she willingly claimed that, while smash-faced [[Drunk|drunk]], she stumbled in on her naked cousin, Alexis, and gave him [[Incest|oral sex]] (if you read earlier in the article, you found that Alexis was actually a made up person, a sort of imaginary friend/relative). We're not sure if she actually did blow a cousin and claim it was Alexis, or if the entire thing is simply a warped fantasy of Zer's.  Throughout the years, she has been known to lean toward incestual relationships in roleplay: from [[twincest]] to father-daughter and father-son relationships, Holly likes keeping her characters inside the same bloodline. What makes it worse is that these fetish roleplay relationships almost always include an underaged child, making for a disturbing combination between her pedophilia and incest fantasies. Due to Zer's fetish for father-child incest especially, it makes one wonder exactly how close she was to her murderous, drug-addled father.

==Footage of Zer==

[[Image:Zer_emo08.jpg|thumb|My life sucks, my job sucks, send me your monies.]]

There was a goldmine of lulz to be seen here - including, but not limited to:
*Zer violently bathing her shaking chihuahua in her own obviously filthy bathwater. Naked. While trying to croon to the terrified animal in her nails-on-a-chalkboard voice.
*Panda being almost too fat to fit into the drivers seat of their small hoopty.
*Zer chasing little boys across a playground while wearing a lemur tail, with a very concerned father looking on.
*Zer blasting a song about fellating little boys from her car at a random chap on the sidewalk.
*Zer feeding kittens with the food bummed from her internet buttbuddies while posing and attempting to look sultry at the camera, caked in horribly done makeup.

But alas, she has deleted them in an attempt to escape [[Buddha|karma]]. Too bad she posts images of herself constantly that are full of every type of [[Inconsistent_Personality_Disorder|hypocritical]] bullshit we could ever hope for.
As long as Holly has an ego, we all have a good laugh.
