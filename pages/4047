[[File:Intelminerfatassfag.gif|thumb|right|IntelMiner's FurAffinity ID, improved version. Isn't he [[cool]]?]]
The illustrious [[Microsoft]] [[Windows]] platform has always been famous for attracting some of the [[G|best the computing community has to offer]] as well as being the focus of some of the most [[neowin|enlightened forums]] on les [[tubes]]. From people who think that installing hex-edited video drivers is the height of [[l33t]] [[hax]], to people who viciously attack [[Unix|other]] [[Mac|platforms]] because they can't run [[World of Warcraft]], Windows [[fanboys|users]] are truly a light to the world.

However, not all of them are fine, upstanding citizens. Such is the case of one [[furfag]] '''Shaun "[[Intel]]" Miner''', whose identity apparently revolves around a chip which is a knockoff of the 4-bit circuits used today in elevators and calculators.  To start, IntelMiner is so far on the wrong side of [[rules 1 and 2]] that he can't even see the line. He also claims that he is the "best IT guy in the [[fat fur]] [[fandom]]", despite the moniker "IT guy" not really being relevant to real world jobs since [[at least 100 years ago|2005]] or so.

Typical of the [[btard|/b/tard]] he claims to be, his online personality is similar to an [[Drugs#Amphetamines|Adderall]]-tripping Yorkshire Terrier. He is hyperactive, obsessive and tries to speak in [[meme]]s to appear as one of the [[4chan|cool kids]]. He doesn't appear to know jack shit about [[computers]] or even [[Windows]], only what you might learn from [[basement dweller|spending your life]] trying to repair your Windows install after installing [[Windows Optimizer]]. According to his [[FurAffinity]] profile, he is [[13 year old boy|eighteen years old]], which would explain a lot.

His [[FurAffinity]] gallery is full of fail, most of it simply being regurgitation of shitty [[Photoshop]]s from [[b|/b/]] and screenshots that have no [[furry]] content, in flagrant violation of the [[e-lawyer|TOS]] of the site. His fursona is allegedly stolen (like much of everything else in IntelMiner's life&mdash;see below) from a [[defriend|former friend]], the same one whose [[deviantART]] he subsequently hacked.

He currently lives in [[Australia]], despite being an [[Americunt]]. He [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/12239874/1405007159 claims] that he makes [[over 9000]] dollars as a server administrator, which is resoundingly similar to [[Furaffinity#Dragoneer.2FPreyfar|Dragoneer's]] claims that he doesn't sit on his fat ass all day and watch the donations roll in while the FA server burns. If he really is an 18-year-old "server administrator" (a vague job description, and also unlikely, since the wild-west days of IT are a decade or more behind us), then I'm sure his employer will be [[ORLY|most interested]] in what their erstwhile employee has been up to on the [[Internets]]. After all, he does still live with his parents.

None of this explains how much [[fail]] he is.

==IntelMiner the Drama Whore==
[[Image:IntelMinercalledout.png|thumb|right|IntelMiner getting called out]]
{{quote|How do I shot [[Debian]]?|Actual rebuttal from IntelMiner}}
A typical IntelMiner dramabomb transpires thusly:
#Shaun attempts (usually [[doing it wrong|clumsily]]) to pull paper-thin wool over the eyes of the [[furry]] fandom, claiming he is doing them a favor.
#Most furfags see through his [[bullshit]] like a clear summer's day.
#Someone is always [[stupid]] enough to fall for his ruse.
#Said person(s) get their shit ruined.
#Drama explodes, IntelMiner denies everything.
#Rinse and repeat.

IntelMiner lives in a complex where he ''never'' starts anything. His claims will soon be "confirmed" from his many [[fanboy]]s who flock to his drama-covered journals and take his side.

If IntelMiner starts on you, simply remind him he is a [[fat]] [[sick fuck|fuck]] and that [[nobody cares]] if he installed [[Gentoo]].

==Criminal Activities==
{{quote|Once again, Im an IT guy, I work at an IT store a lot of our customers bring in their super cheap laptops/netbooks and request Win7 removed and XP stuck in its place, we sell XP cheaper because we reclaim the cost by selling Win7 second hand!|IntelMiner, [[bullshit|IT store]] employee.}}

We suspect that IntelMiner may one day be a [[loser|big deal]] in the world of computer-related crime, because already, at the tender age of 18, he has shown the world that he has what it takes to screw over people he wants to be his friends. [[Last Thursday]], IntelMiner told everyone that he was going to sell copies of Windows 7 on the cheap, giving away Ultimate editions for only 20 dollars. This was such a hamfisted attempt to sell [[warez]] from [[BitTorrent]] that even the [[furfags]] at FurAffinity were suspicious. However, as is always the case, a number of furries fell for the ruse and to [[no one|everyone's]] surprise, multiple reports of the software he sold being infected have surfaced. [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1254525/ This] loser says that somehow, his Steam and several other instant messaging and e-mail accounts were hacked, and [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1254525/#cid:10484393 this] comment says that at least one other person had the exact same thing happen to them. Whether or not IntelMiner is actually behind the hackings is [[it is a mystery|anyone's guess]], because given his incompetence it's entirely possible he just passed along an infected torrent to his [[retards|unsuspecting <s>marks</s> customers]].

===The Sting===
When he was caught selling infected copies of Windows 7, several [[losers|upstanding members]] of the [[furry]] community came forward with stories of Shaun's past attempts at separating [[sarcasm|innocent]] furries from their [[prostitution|hard-earned]] [[money]]. One furry gullible enough to fork over the $20 to our scammer friend has come forward and confirmed that the key he received was the infamous [http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/08/01/microsoft-may-block-and-blacklist-22tkd-oem-slp-product-key-for-windows-7-crack/ 22TKD key], which is expected to be [[banhammer|blacklisted]] by [[Microsoft]] very soon. When confronted with this fact, IntelMiner resorted to many [[lulz]]y (and [[lame]]) attempts to defend himself, including the hilarious "IT store" quote above. He also [[nice try|attempted]] to cite [[Yahoo! Answers]] as a source to justify his [[bullshit]], confusing [[copyright|first sale doctrine]] that allows people to sell used software with Microsoft's special type of product key for computer manufacturers. Nevermind that these keys are property of a <s>IT store</s> computer-manufacturing company, and not his to sell, the key was in fact leaked from Lenovo in a highly-publicized event [[last Thursday|last year]]. He [[delete fucking everything|baleeted]] the journal he wrote when it became clear that his attempts to cover his [[ass]] were not succeeding.

Other accounts include attempts to sell cracked copies of Windows XP, which can be had for free on [[BitTorrent]], and an attempt to give away [[virus|infected]] copies of [[video games]].

Ever since Shaun was caught out trying to pull a basic criminal scam (and not doing it very well), his [[butthurt]] has been thinly veiled under a trollish obsession with the person who exposed him. Despite the fact that this occurred [[at least 100 years ago|months ago]], he has not given up, in the great furry tradition of holding Internet grudges for years and [[Xydexx|even decades]]. Experts at one time believed that this was because there is so little meaning or activity in his life that the Internet and obsessing over various random people provide an illusion of satisfaction to him, but they have recently concluded based on irrefutable [[evidence]] that it is because he is a massive [[faggot]].

===Faggots never change===

{{notice|He's still at it!}}

Recently, he was banned from [[FurAffinity]] for [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1842725/ hacking], and, as is a furry custom, blogged about it and mentioned this page, and several contributors to the page, even though they had nothing to do with whatever faggotry he managed to get involved with this time. This sort of obvious [[butthurt]] which he can't hide is why [[troll]]ing IntelMiner is so satisfying. He even thinks the fact that he can [http://i53.tinypic.com/34zy8hg.jpg set up] [[Microsoft|Active Directory]] on his home network is some kind of accomplishment. Besides the fact that Active Directory is basically designed so that even [[Windows]] fanboys (i.e. those that have [[jobs]] pretending they're [[Objectivism|smarter and better]] than the drones at whatever office they work at) can clean the drool off their keyboards and set it up, and the fact that it's entirely pointless for his little faggoty network of Asus white boxes and Alienware computers (see below), when you spend your days at [[basement-dweller|home]], and have a life defined by literally nothing other than [[drama]] on FurAffinity, this is an [[a winnar is you|accomplishment]].

==The [[attention whore]]==
{{quote|Actually, [[USI|judging by our respective friends lists, I have a far more positive fan base than you do]]|IntelMiner|USI problems}}
[[File:Inteltwit.JPG|right|thumb|He actually is fapping to this.]] IntelMiner has a history of hacking people's online accounts, such as [[deviantART]], [[FurAffinity]], and others, and leaving [[obvious|subtle]] hints that he was to blame. Of course, IntelMiner's idea of a clever hint is most people's idea of a giant honking dump truck. He does things like deleting everyone from a user's [[friends list]], except for himself. He allegedly has wanted an [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] article for some time, and was [[butthurt]] when he was removed from the [[Portal:Furfaggotry/Needed|Furfag needed]] page. This suggests IntelMiner is following in the footsteps of other such epic attention-whore furry failures as [[Sage Freehaven]], and is probably [[masturbating]] to this article right now. 

[[You]] can help put a stop to this shit by using non-retarded passwords on your accounts. It's not as if he's exactly a [[1337]] [[h4xx0r]], he is simply enabled by the fact that he is only marginally more intelligent than your average furry, which is to say he probably has an I.Q. of around 47. IntelMiner may even be involved with the uber 1337 [[U413]] crew, so '''''BE WARNED.'''''

==Honesty is such a lonely word==
Perhaps unlike his [[furluminati]] counterparts, who have their [[faggotry]] overlooked in the name of furthering the great worldwide furry conspiracy, IntelMiner has acquired something of a reputation among the [[furfags]] as someone who is "not to be trusted". He seems aware of this, as evidenced in [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1097763/ this] journal. Evidence suggests that he has tried to pawn off his [[warez]] on others before the pile of Windows 7 drama that earned him this page, and he is generally seen by [[furries]] as a two-bit scammer who doesn't so much want friends as he does to make a couple of bucks off of the naive. Of course, being in the furry fandom, he will be a millionaire before the end of this year.

Any furries with information on past dramaclusterfucks caused by IntelMiner are encouraged to contact [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] so that the [[drama]] may be properly documented and the [[lulz]] dispensed in a safe and professional manner.

==IntelMiner And Computer Security==
The man claims to be going to [[college]] (actually, he's going to a [[ITT Tech|TAFE]] school, like [[Ashley Towns|a certain other]] [[web design|computer security]] poser), for [[Security Faggotry]] (and he's gonna get some MCSE thing too, don't you forget it!), yet, as seems to always be the case with such [[attention whore]]s, the [[faggotry]] of his own computer system is unbounded. He runs an [[anonymous]] FTP server that lists the contents of his [[Windows]] C:\ drive, and he still has password based logins enabled on his SSH server.

But here's a [[protip]]: while our friend here has no qualms about actually [[hacking]] someone's password to a web site, or selling copyrighted software with malicious code injected into it, he will [[BAWWW]] like hell and report you to the [[party van]] if you dare to log into this FTP server (which has no password, [[but who was phone|so it's not being hacked]]). Because just like every other [[Security Faggots|Security Faggot]] on this planet, it's no problem when you're ruining other people's shit, but when your own idiocy is pointed out, well, it's [[butthurt]] time!

His DynDNS domain is '''intelmineriv.dontexist.com''', which he no longer updates. He now publishes his [http://intelminer.com/javascript/quotes.js amazing code] and essays that make [[Sarah Palin]] look like a spelling-bee champion at [http://intelminer.com intelminer.com]. His first contribution to the public discourse is a groundbreaking, genre-defining "Linux rant" in which he puts forth the novel and revolutionary opinion that all [[Lunix]] distributions suck. Experts are divided as to what is the bigger delusion: that he thinks he has something new to say on this subject that hasn't already been said in [[over 9000]] different [[Slashdot]] threads, or that he has such an [[USI|overinflated sense of self-worth]] that he thinks anyone actually cares what he has to say on anything at all.

==Silicon [[Ricer]]==

{{notice|'''[[TL;DR]]''': Basically, IntelMiner is like every other suburban teenage faggot to post in [[G|/g/]], but is too stupid to realize he should become [[an hero]].}}

There exist a certain class of computer users who see their "[[shit|rigs]]" as nothing more than an extension of their [[e-penis]]. They don't use these [[computer]]s as practical tools for [[porn|accomplishing work]] as [[you|normal people]] do, but use them to [[gay|top]] their [[circlejerk|online buddies]] in the "who has the [[over 9000|most megahertz]]" competition. This is exactly like people who install 6ft. fins on their Honda Civic, remove the logo, and think this makes them [[l33t]].

[[File:ICanActuallyRunPrograms.png|center|IntelMiner forgets what computers are actually for.]]


[[File:AwesomeCar.jpg|right|thumb|IntelMiner believes his computer is like this...]]
[[File:Barney_and_the_car_by_tooner14.jpg|right|thumb|...It's more along these lines]]
A popular pastime among this crowd is to install [[Apple|Mac OS X]] on their shitty "capacitor popper" PC rigs. As they think Macs are just glorified PCs because they have x86 processors in them, this seems like a good idea. So they download hacked versions of OS X that are adorned with names like "[[faggot|Kalyway]]" and [[chav|street art]] and shout-outs to their [[buttsex|homies]]. Somehow, these people manage to make Mac OS even shittier than the real version from Apple. Experts have recently discovered that this is because they are massive [[faggots]].

After they install and get a simple 640x480 screen, they have to install hacked graphics drivers written by [[experts]] trained at [[ITT Tech]] in the fine art of [[Visual Basic]] and [[Computer Science III]]. These geniuses have no conception of what a pointer is or [[how do I shot web|how to do threading]], and things go downhill from there, if you can imagine that. It's important to remember, the fact that their [[AMD]]-powered rig crashes every time they open [[YouTube]] isn't what's important. It's that they [[USI|have something no one else has]]! But don't mention to these people that [[Linux]] is nowadays more useful, stable, and has better drivers for more hardware, because then you're just a whiny open-source faggot who is too much of a n00b to do a lot of fucking about to be a cheap Macfag, amirite?

It should surprise [[no one]] that IntelMiner's favorite [[Lunix]] distribution is [http://funroll-loops.info/ Gentoo]. Recently, when trying to [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|imply that Gentoo users were better than Debian users]], he was [[butthurt]] enough to make yet another [[journal]] about getting trolled, and then, when he was unsure if he had [[trying too hard|tried hard enough]], he posted [http://i52.tinypic.com/9pom0n.jpg this] graphic of his computers to the Internet. Basically, instead of farting out his [[basement dweller|mom's basement]] playing [[TF2]] and [[failing]] at [[troll]]ing, he spent 45 minutes in [[MS Paint]] trying to show a world that [[nobody cares|doesn't care]] how big his e-peen is. Of course, much [[lulz]] were then had when it was revealed that, as suspected, he owns an Alienware computer, like every other live-at-home teenage video-game tool ever. There was also a conspicuous lack of anything [[Cisco]], leading [[some argue|some]] to question the judgment of a [[Computer Science III]] major who uses a router from a third-rate [[Taiwan]]ese maker of pirated computer chips.

==IntelMiner Fails At Everything==

In a turn of events that surprises [[no one]], he decided to [[stop posting]] his lame single-digit-comment-count journals to [[FurAffinity]] and set up his own [[server]] to host his [[blog]] about [[drama]]. This was done, [[experts]] believe, to ensure no one would ever read or care about his blog ever again. He even invokes fellow drama douche and purposeless failure at life SilverAutomatic as a model of his new drama blog, which ensures that IntelMiner will keep his standards low and fail to meet even those.

As of [[last Thursday]] however, he hasn't even been able to [[fail]], since he's [[fail]]ed at [[fail]]ing.

[[File:IntelMiner_Fails_At_Everything.png|500px|center]]

He [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|can't even set up Wordpress]], so he can run a blog that no one will read. Even [[your mom]] can set up Wordpress. In fact, his server has nothing on it, which is an appropriate analogy for what IntelMiner has to offer the world.

==[[Sockpuppet]]ry==
In a now deleted journal, the [[FurAffinity]] user '''specopsbear''' accused Shaun of impersonating him on ED so that he could [[autofellatio|edit his own article]] and not be noticed. Until it's deleted, IntelMiner's reply denying everything (see Modus Operandi above) can be viewed [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1408348/ here]. After it's deleted a screencap will be posted, of course. 

When looking at the [[Special:Contributions/SpecOpsBear|edits]] made by this account, it becomes pretty obvious that it's IntelMiner, talking about himself in the third person like a [[fucktard]]. It also explains why that account was trying to get shit ([http://stashbox.org/839341/aBriefTour.txt such as this]) taken out of the article. IntelMiner even tried to remove the dox of his virtual boyfriend [[Zareth]] from his original article.

You can tell if a sock is one of IntelMiner's - he will edit this page, get his shit reverted then spam the talk page with terribly hidden [[white knight]]ing. Don't take him seriously.

More evidence of the faggotry can be seen on [[User talk:SpecOpsBear#IntelMiner|his talk page]].

Sockpuppets so far:

* [[User:SpecOpsBear]]
* [[User:DragonWaffle]]
* [[User:Nrr]] (continuing his tradition of identity theft)

We've replaced IntelMiner's brain, that should have told him that this is a war he can't win, with a rotting cabbage. Let's see if anyone notices!

===Nope, not obsessed===

[[User:KlikKlak|This genius]] claims he's not IntelMiner, but he sure seems to have the same writing style and the same obsessions as our faggy friend from down under, doesn't he?
