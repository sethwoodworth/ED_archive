Vaginapagina
[[Image:Feminist_symbol.gif|thumb|right|'''Vaginas''' aren't funny]]
{{ljcomm|vaginapagina}} is a [[LiveJournal]] [[community]] about the [[vagina]], and everything related to it. This is a very serious subject. So stop laughing.  

Vaginapagina is very into the concept of safe space, which means that you can't disagree with people because it'll hurt their feelings. This leads to some weird-ass rules; for instance, if you find out you don't have [[AIDS]] or the herp, you're not allowed to say you're "clean" because that implies that people who DO have STDs are "dirty." This is a big no-no, but somehow [http://community.livejournal.com/vaginapagina/12595781.html?thread=151735877#t151735877 coming out in favor of forced sterilization] won't get you banned.

No, it doesn't make any sense. That's because vaginas are sacred and you just don't understand, you big dumb patriarchal man.
