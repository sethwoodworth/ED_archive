Memefag
{{needsmore|pictures of memefaggotry}}

'''Memefags''' are a particularly aggravating sub-division of [[newfag]] who spam the same [[unfunny]] [[memes]] [[over 9000]] times in <s>[[at least 100]]</s> [[DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS]] threads and never know when to [[stop posting]]. This gives them the impression that they are [[l33t]] [[hackers on steroids|hackers on <strike>steriods</strike> <strike>periods</strike> steroidz]] and frequently sends self-proclaimed [[oldfags]] into a [[rage|RAAAAAAAGGGGGGGE]] upon viewing such great levels of [[fail]].

==[dys]Functional Definition==
[[Image:AdviceRetard6.jpg|thumb|[[No|IT ALL MAKES SENSE!]]]]
''Memefag'' (n): One who habitually abuses [[memes]] within and especially outside of memespace for the purpose of making [[no_girls_on_the_internet|himself]] look like a clever and amusing individual but [[fail]]s to achieve the desired effect.

===Relevant Terminology===
*''Memespace'' (n): For the purposes of this article, those sites on the [[Internet]] where [[memes]] are regularly generated, documented, and/or circulated by nature of the site itself; this designation includes [[ED]] itself, [[4chan|all]] [[7chan|chans]] which are not [[fail]], and earlier [[lulz]] factories such as [[Something Awful]].
*''Memedrop'' (v): The use of a meme out of context; this could mean temporally out of context (i.e. an [[unfunny]] combo in the middle of an actual discussion), or memetically out of context - essentially, entirely [[pic_unrelated|unrelated]] to anything being discussed at the time. '''The key in either case is that said memedropping is considered [[unfunny]] by a plurality of other users''' - some of the best memes can [[Cum|come]] and [[Shit|go]] completely at [[random]] and still propel the [[roflcopter]] to [[OVER 9000|staggering heights]].
*''Memespam'' (v): The repeated and chronic use of a meme or memes out of context as mentioned above; this term assumes said repetition is entirely deliberate in nature. Whereas memedropping can be and usually is an isolated incident, meme''spamming'' is an attempt to [[cuntpaste|simulcast]] one's [[unfunny]] across a number of threads or boards or even entire sites. Typically the most reliable determinant of memefaggotry.

==The Problem==
([[PROTIP]]: Itâ€™s not the [[memes]]! It's [[you]].)

It should be emphasized at this point that contrary to what [[Some_argue|some have expressed]], memes themselves are not to blame for this phenomenon. In fact, as has been said in numerous articles [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|here]], memes are the lifeblood of interbutts culture. That said, would [[you]] appreciate [[Nigra|someone]] introducing [[AIDS|contaminants]] into your [[Pool|lifeblood?]] Actually, [[Bug chasers|you might]], you [[sick fuck]]. But [[mundane|most people]] wouldn't. That is why this can be a very [[flame wars|sensitive issue]] to [[EDiots|so]] [[Btards|many]] [[weev|online]]. Through its careless appropriation of others' [[lulz]], memefaggotry ruins what everyone could have enjoyed for the sake of one. Fucking. Poster. And not even a remotely funny fucking poster. Needless to say, [[this is why we can't have nice things]].

==Life Cycle of a Meme==
[[File:Longpokeplz.JPG|thumb|Collision of memes is a common result.]]

#'''Origin:''' - What makes a great meme? Nobody really knows. Like a case of [[herpes]], some memes are picked up without us ever knowing their origins. Regardless, for all the [[Milhouse|piles]] of intellectual [[Abortion|stillbirths]] floating around in memespace, [[Last Thursday|every so often]] a genuine meme will emerge from its [[NO_BINARIES|binary]] chrysalis and flutter its way into the collective consciousness.
#'''Recognition:''' - The meme is acknowledged. This can either be in the form of an epic, varied and [[lulz|very funny]] thread or simply repeated over and over again by somebody with Down's Syndrome and a keyboard. Memes with adequate levels of [[awesome]] are frequently [[image macro|macroed]], which [[some argue]] is the most reliable indicator that a meme will progress from this stage.
#'''Proliferation:''' - Not only is the meme a regular fixture in the segment of memespace in which it originated, by this point it has most likely moved from its original site (often [[4chan]]) into other areas of the internet within and beyond memespace. Extremely popular memes even end up on T-shirts - a mixed blessing, as this not only increases a meme's rate of proliferation but also the probability of falling into [[Newfag|the wrong hands]].
#'''Saturation:''' - Classic memes fit in here. The meme is willingly accepted as being part of internet culture, however old it may be. Successful memes are able to remain at this stage for some time, and truly classic ones only leave this stage if they are [[Nancy Pelosi|grievously abused in a very visible manner]]. 
#'''Stagnation:''' - The point at which a meme has [[jumped the shark]]. Even successful memes can become [[unfunny]] if they are used excessively or in the wrong context. Borderline memefags contribute to this effect, but more often than not it is a product of either the momentum a meme has gathered in the proliferation stage or the visibility it has garnered in the saturation stage. [[Old media|TV shows]] like [[South Park]] and [[Family Guy]] often pick up memes at this point; whether this is a cause or a symptom of a meme's stagnation is debatable.
#'''[[RAGE#FFFUUUUUUU|FFFFRUSTRATION:]]''' - This is where obvious memefags come in. Unable to realize [[Milhouse|some memes just aren't funny]] or worse, using memes [[IRL]] (like saying "[[lol]]" when someone tells a joke), they can turn the most popular internet phenomena into [[shit]]. This stage is named for the profound psychological impact it has in memespace.
#'''Extinction:''' - While some memes may simply vanish into the ether, once [[You|enough memefags]] realize there's just no mileage left in them, more often than not it becomes necessary to [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|forcibly restrict their use]] through judicious use of the [[banhammer]]. Essentially, [[X Y is X|old meme is old]] and [[nothing of value was lost]].
#'''Resurrection:''' - If a meme has not been used for long enough it can become fresh and funny again. This <s>practically</s> never happens, but this may be because the duration of time required for something to cease to be [[old meme]] could in fact be greater than the age of memespace.

==Symptoms of Memefaggotry==
===Perpetuating vs. [[DOING IT WRONG|Meme Masturbating]]===
[[File:SquirtingMemes.png|thumb|Meme masturbation in action.]]
A good functional definition of memefaggotry is the practice of [[Rape|appropriating]] [[memes]] in an effort to selfishly [[hax|exploit]] memespace's collective [[lulz]] for one's own personal [[I_came|glory]]. As suggested in the definitions of ''memedrop'' and ''memespam'', this can be done either by [[Dynamic_Entry|interrupting]] an ongoing discussion or [[crapflood]]ing a forum with a meme - ''any'' meme  - for no reason beyond sheer [[attention whoring]]. It is easy to spot a memefag by this self-centered and [[unfunny]] use of a meme, contrasted with those of us who simply wish to share the [[lulz]] with all. Such altruistic individuals can help prolong the lifespan of a meme through moderation in its use, while memefags will continue to memespam as long as they get any sort of attention out of anyone.

===Levels of Memefaggotry===

<big><b><span class="co;[Oh god what have I done?!];[I See What You Did There . . .];0;MF1"></span></b></big>
<span class="MF1" style="color:red; padding:5px;"><br><br>#'''Meme virgin:''' These individuals are mere [[n00bs]] and simply don't know any better. They are still getting acquainted with the various memes and at their [[retarded|developmental stage]], they primarily repeat them just to make themselves laugh. How cute. It is difficult to fault these meme virgins for their relative ignorance, but an occasional [[IRC|kick]] is recommended [[for the lulz]] and to screen for potential [[lolcows]].</span><span class="MF1" style="color:orange; padding:5px;"><br><br>#'''Typical EDiot / /b/tard / Channer:''' Your typical garden-variety denizen of an intertubes community, going about his or her business trading [[lulz]] on the open market. Just another day at the office. Typically, memes are used in context and at appropriate times, and most [[EDiots]] or [[B|/b/tards]] or whatever will confine them to locations on the tubes where said memes are most likely to be understood and appreciated.</span><span class="MF1" style="color:olive; padding:5px;"><br><br>#'''Potential Memefag:''' Memes are memes because they're [[lulzy]], and we all know people who are [[fantard|really]] [[gamer|serious]] [[Sp|about]] the things they enjoy. So it's understandable if some people [[rape|don't know when to stop]] once in a while. Just about everyone has been guilty of the occasional unsolicited memedrop at some point or another ([[Irony|this article does so several times]]), but an increase in the frequency of these incidents may be a sign of a definite tendency toward memefaggotry. Fortunately, many posters are able to recognize their own [[unfunny]] before such unsolicited memedropping becomes habitual. But not all...</span><span class="MF1" style="color:green; padding:5px;"><br><br>#'''Meme-curious:''' The tipping point for many memefags comes when they are [[trying_too_hard|habitually memedropping]] out of context [[OTI]] and also occasionally in [[IRL|meatspace]] as well. This is usually nothing more than questioning an acquaintance about their affection for [[Mudkip]]s or mentioning that they are charging their [[laser]]s, but this breach of the [[series of tubes|tubes]] represents a ''faux pas'' not unlike an actor breaking character. To people [[IRL]], it connotes stereotypes of [[basement dweller]]s, while to those [[OTI]], it implies that someone is "at risk" for breaking [[rules of the internet|Rules 1 and 2]] - and if they can't keep memes in confidence online, what other [[Dox|information]] can't they be trusted with? Fortunately, these borderline cases typically avoid known [[forced meme]]s, mitigating the annoyance created at the cost of incrementally diminishing the life expectancy of actually good memes.</span><span class="MF1" style="color:blue; padding:5px;"><br><br>#'''[[Obvious]] Memefag:''' Memefags typically out themselves by clearly and routinely demonstrating that they have appropriated memespace's collective [[lulz]] for [[NYPA|their own personal use]] completely irrespective of the context in which their memes of choice originated. [[Protestfag]]s in particular fall into this category by [[Sarah Palin|going rogue]] and ignoring both the collective groans of memespace and the admonitions of [[Wise Beard Man]], but to their credit they typically avoid [[facefag|unmasking themselves]], which prevents them from slipping any further down this list. [[OTI]], [[x_y_is_x|obvious memefags are obvious]] through similar feats of "memejacking" - a typical sign of this is when a particular user claims a particular meme as his or her own (we're looking at you, [[TARTlet]]s) and spams the fuck out of it in hopes that they might become associated closely enough with said meme to ensure a measure of [[e-famous|e-fame]] for themselves. Like the meme-curious, these [[retards|problem children]] still retain ''some'' measure of discrimination when it comes to their choice of memes, but they are not above the use of [[forced meme]]s by any means.</span><span class="MF1" style="color:purple; padding:5px;"><br><br>#'''Flaming Memefag:''' The point of no return for a memefag is when the all-important Rules 1 and 2 are broken. Not only will this individual [[spam]] and [[forced meme|force]] memes just because [[unrealistic_expectations|they think it'll be hilarious]], they will simultaneously and intentionally [[namefag]] and [[facefag]] themselves in an attempt to translate their [[USI|perceived OTI coolness]] into meatspace coolness. This, of course, is a choice every poster on every site in memespace can make, but once [[Anonymous]] becomes aware of this, it will be [[never|some time]] before they are willing to forgive such an infraction of the [[rules_of_the_internet|rules]]. An additional shortcoming of these [[cancer]]ous characters is a general inability to discriminate between quality and [[unfunny]] memes; it's just as well, however, because at least they're abusing [[old meme]]s instead of ruining good ones.</span><span class="MF1" style="color:magenta; padding:5px;"><br><br>#'''[[ALL CAPS|INSATIABLE MEMEFAG:]]''' These walking [[frunz]] emitters are easily spotted as they generally live under the shadow of the [[banhammer]]. Completely lacking in both restraint and discrimination, they will [[spam]] the [[fuck]] out of any and every meme of which they are aware. [[OTI]] they will at every turn do [[retarded]] things like attempt to [[fail|combo]] [[Milhouse]], invoke [[Girugamesh]], and '''CONSTANTLY''' [[rape]] the [[Necrophilia|corpse]] of the long dead and much pitied (although not missed) [[Rick Astley]]. [[IRL]] they will blab to their [[Lol|"friends"]], their [[your_mom|family members]], and their [[Bestiality|fucking housepets]] about [[Nod Flenders]] or [[Woll Smoth]] ''completely uncaring that these people have no fucking clue what they are talking about''. The worst of [[TARTlet]] offenders fall squarely into this category... scratch that, the '''[[ALL CAPS|WORST OF EVERYTHING]]''' falls squarely into this category. These individuals represent the most imminent threat to the [[lulz]] and [[b&|must]] [[Gline|be]] [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|stopped]] before every meme [[ED]], [[4chan]], and everywhere else becomes just as [[unfunny]] and [[DO_NOT_WANT|unwanted]] as [[Pettan, pettan, tsurupettan]].</span>

==[[IRL]] Memefags==
[[File:Wait_for_it.jpg|thumb|Attendez la meme.]]
{{main|IRL meme}}

Although most memes are created on the internet and picked up by the [[old media]] once everybody has become sick of them, occasionally a meme will originate [[IRL]] and quickly worm its way onto the [[internet]].

One notable example is [[Kanye West]] with his (in)famous line "[[Imma Let You Finish]]" and "[[Yo X I'm Really Y For You]]" (often used together). The most famous IRL memefag is, of course, [[Richard Dawkins]] who coined the word "meme" - a piece of information which magically takes on a life of its own when people start saying it often enough, [[Fact|which in fact perfectly describes memes on the internet]].

==The Body Count==
