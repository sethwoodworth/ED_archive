'''Tim Armer''' (A.K.A. Kool-Aid Man) is a [[oh exploitable|highly visible]] [[Scientologist|Scilon]] [[newbie|handler]], [[insane|footbullet king]], [[homophobe]], and [[Internet tough guy|meathead]] who lives with his [[Dear Sister|sister]] in the [[porn|San Fernando Valley]] in [[Los Angeles|Southern California]]. Recently he was filmed going into a [[Bodies in Pawn|pawn shop]] to see if he could [[steal|borrow]] more [[jew golds|money]] for [[scam|Scilon courses]].

==Failbullet stories==
[[Image:Koolaidscilon.png|thumb|Original Sighting.]]
During [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY/OPERATION_SEA_ARRRGH|Operation Sea Arrrg]], [[Angry gay pope|Angry Gay Pope]] was arguing against several Scicunts, one of which was Tim Armer and while he was putting the Scifags in [[intellectual checkmate]], the Pope [[pwned|destroyed]] Tim's mind and was reduced to the levels of [[Tom Cruise|a laughing maniacal faggot]]. It should be noted that Tim tried to put on his [[cool face]] that day but failed miserably since it just made his face all red, hence the name Kool-Aid Man. According to AGP, as a result of imitating his Scifag savior, Tim was forced to take large numbers of Scientology courses over again at a high cost. This wouldn't be the last time that he had to retake courses or get [[raped|Sec Checked]].
