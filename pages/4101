Internrt
The '''Internrt''' is the vapid space of nothingness that exists between the letter "e" and the letter "r" on the keyboard of various [[nerd]]s and [[geek]]s. Due to a space-time anomaly, their entire [[sex]] life can fit in this space. Often, to the casual observer, this anomaly appears as a blob of indeterminate, perhaps intimate origins, or as a small particle of salty snack food - however '''do not lick it up''', regardless of how tempting it seems. To the geek or nerd, this space represents their entire reason for existence (i.e., their [[virgin]] [[sex]]uality), and they will often bring it up in the middle of an entirely irrelevant [[chat]], [[blog]], [[community]] or [[forum]] thread.
