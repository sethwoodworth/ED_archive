Tony Alamo
[[Image:TonyAlamo.jpg|thumb|right|Wanna fuck?]]
'''Tony Alamo''' (aka Jew) has tried his hand at a [[at least 100|few different trades]] in his life.  He's been a [[Britney Spears|entertainer]], [[Jonathan King|record producer]], [[Fat|health club owner]], and [[unemployed|entrepreneur]].  However, the one industry in which he truly thrived was that of [[christian|evangelist]].  Jew, Alamo used his [[leeching|natural abilities]] to open the Tony Alamo Christian Ministries along with his wife [[Mary Sue|Susan]].  Little did he know how many [[lulz]] were to be had.

Starting out as a [[Hollywood]] street ministry, Tony and Susan spent their days [[pimping]] themselves out to all the [[homeless|fine]], [[criminal|upstanding]], [[Drug-addled Yenta|well adjusted]], [[prostitute|working class]] folks found roaming the neighborhood.  Once they had gained enough [[money]], they took their [[basement dwellers|flock]] and relocated to beautiful [[Arkansas]].  This is where the church really started to prosper and Tony was able to expand his growing [[The Empire of Arkantos|empire]] into a multitude of different arenas including a printing shop, a grocery store, a trucking company and a bunch of other [[shit nobody cares about]].  The church was also able to start offering [[drug]] [[rehab]], [[Computer Science III|job training]] and [[welfare|room and board]] for those in need of help.  This turned out to be a [[Mega ultra super genius|brilliant]] move for Tony as he was now provided with a [[slave|workforce]] for his next venture: [http://cgi.ebay.com/Tony-Alamo-Designer-Denim-NY-Jacket_W0QQitemZ170293209882QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUS_CSA_WC_Blazers_Tailored_Jackets?hash=item170293209882&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1205|66%3A2|65%3A12|39%3A1|240%3A1318|301%3A1|293%3A1|294%3A50 An Alamo clothing line].  However, hindsight is 20/20, and looking back Tony probably should have realized that the [[nazi|labor board]] probably wouldn't take to kindly to his business techniques.  The subsequent [[raping]] from the labor board signals the beginning of what would be an incredible downward spiral which included:

*Being sued in 1988 [[lol wut|for beating an 11 year old through the kids parents over the phone]].
*Supposedly taking 2 [[16 year old girl|15 year old girls]] from his congregation as [[pedophile|"wives"]] after Susan kicked.
*Being sued for [[stealing|embezzling]] [[over 9000|$100,000]] from his trucking company. 
*Having his congregation [[necrophilia|remove Susan's body from the church compound]] just before an IRS raid.
*Ultimately having to give Susan's body back to her family after yet another [[lolsuit]].
*Being convicted in 1994 of federal tax evasion and [http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&FirstName=Bernie&Middle=&LastName=Hoffman&Race=U&Sex=U&Age=&x=98&y=13 serving 4 years in prison].

Since his release in 1998, Tony has resumed his role of head Jew at his church where he spouts off all sorts of [[lulz|lulzy]] comments such as the [[pope]] and the [[president]] are part of a [[satan|satanic conspiracy]] which was responsible for [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]], [[World War II|Pearl Harbor]] and [[9/11]].  This, however, is nothing more than Jew trickery as everyone knows that [[Jews did 9/11]].

Being an [[batshit insane|evangelical church]] you know Tony and his flock are going to be spouting off some [[retarded]] nonsense.  But to really get a feel for the level of [[insane|insanity]] present in the Alamo church, a brief list of some core values is required:

*The [[pope]] is the [[TheAmazingAtheist|Antichrist]].
*The [[Christian|Catholic church]] is the church of [[Satan]].
*The Catholics are also trying to form a [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy|one-world government]]. -Quick someone call [[Alex Jones]]!
*If you [[party hard|pray hard]] enough God will send a [http://www.alamoministries.com/content/english/Gospel_literature/flying_saucers.html squadron of flying saucers for you to see]
*Being [[gay]] is a [[fail|poor choice]].
*Children should get [[rape|married]] at the age of [[loli|puberty]].
*Only Tony knows how to properly interpret the Bible.
*Tony believed that Susan was going to [[USI|resurrected]] and as such, kept her body on [[attention whore|display]] for 6 months after death.<br><br><br>

On September 20th 2008, acting on a tip they received from [[Chris Hansen|a guy who owns a lot of chairs]], the [[partyvan]] [[raid|raided]] the church headquarters trying to find some [[cp]].  Along with the child [[pron]] come allegations of physical abuse, [[baby fuck|sexual abuse]], and [[mormon|polygamy]].  The allegations stem from former [[butthurt]] members of Tony's church who just wanted in on the [[rape|action]] but were [[ddos|denied]] by Tony who holds on to his [[cp]] tighter than he holds onto his [[jew gold]].  While Tony officially denied the charges, the partyvan [[ceiling cat|watches you masturbate]] and as such know that Tony is [[lying]] through his teeth.  Sick and tired of his [[faggotry]], the feds [[v&]] Tony on September 25th charging him with [[pedophile|transporting minors over state lines for sexual activity]].  As of December 6th, 7 additional counts have been filed against Tony which all have to do with [[secks|secksing]] up [[loli|children]].  Have fun getting [[goatse|goatsed]] in the [[prison|big house]] Tony.<br><br><br>

== Quotes ==

{{quote|The living conditions were disgusting. We slept body to body in sleeping bags on the floor. When I was there, I never saw a real bed. At the time I left though, I was sleeping on a cot. We loved it when the weather warmed up, so we could sleep outside where it wasn't so crowded. The bathroom conditions were worse. The toilets were always full because we were told that if we flushed them, the leaching field wouldn't hold it all. So about every two or three days they were flushed. There also wasn't no more than three toilets per 50, 60 men [sic]. I do not know how it was for the women or the children. Showers were very seldom. We either never had time or the water was always cold. I took a shower about once a week.| One of Tony's [[slave|factory workers]] on living conditions.}}

{{quote|Susan said, 'Let’s pray. Let’s hold hands and pray and ask God, ‘God if there is such a thing as flying saucers, show them to us right now.’ ...I heard her say, 'Come on Tony, let’s hold hands and pray that God will show us flying saucers.' I said, 'All right.' She was driving and I took her hand. She prayed, 'Oh Lord, God Almighty, if there are such things as flying saucers, show them to us, Father, in the name of Jesus.' I said, 'Amen, Lord.' No sooner had she said this prayer, and I said Amen, Lord then a squadron of flying saucers began approaching us very quickly from far in the distance. They descended from way up high down within a fraction of an inch of the windshield of the car with a speed as fast as lightning.| [[lol wut]]}}

{{quote|We don't go into pornography; nobody in the church is into that. Where do these allegations stem from? The anti-Christ government. The Catholics don't like me because I have cut their congregation in half. They hate true Christianity| Tony [[butthurt]] over being [[v&]].}}
