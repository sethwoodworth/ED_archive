'''Threadless.com''' is a T-shirt company whose target demographic are the kids that used to buy clothes at [[Hot Topic]], Tshirthell.com and ED Tshirts (in other words [[you]]) in high school, but then they realized that [[goth]] was out and [[indie]] was in, so they had to age it up.

Their slogan is "By Homos for Homos" in that the designs were made by homosexuals for homosexuals, like you.  It doesn't matter if you're [[fat]] or overweight, or chubby, or big boned, or "trying to balance your depression medicine," or "have a bad thyroid", you too can be a part of the [[shit nobody cares about|latest craze]] as long as you have money to spend, and lots of it!  Despite the fact that all the models are skinny, only a fat frumpy [[lesbian]] who is insecure about his/her weight would wear a shirt with this much gay in it.  The shirts are full of thread despite the company name. These [[jews]] have swindled millions from the hands of overweight teens by making shit t-shirts for $4 and selling them for $20. BUY ONE FOR YOUR FRIEND TOO LOL SHIRT BUDDYS!!!

This web site has all kinds of shirts that have been around for [[At least 100 years|at least 100 years]] and are still being marketed to people who think shirts with [[unfunny|unfunny]] things on them are entertaining.  But these [[fags|people]] like [[cock]] in the [[ass]].
