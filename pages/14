[[Image:SupB.jpg|thumb|WTF is /B/?]]

[[Image:Summaryofb.png|thumb|A summary of /b/ in regards to this article.]]

While '''/b/''' is technically a sub-board of many [[chan]] [[imageboard]]s, it is more commonly known as the asshole of the [[Internets]]. According to [[Faux News]], they are also [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNO6G4ApJQY a secret underground network of evil hackers on steroids]. It is populated by [[pedophilia|pedophiles]], [[Furry|furries]], [[otaku]], [[You|basement dwellers]], [[wapanese]], [[Azn]]s, WoWfags, [[otherkin]], Trent Reznor, probably [[Will Smith]], and recently [[gentlemen]]. Also, [[God]] has been known to lurk /b/ for hopes of landing some hawt [[Baby Fuck]]. All these fags are called [[fag|/b/tards]]. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villany.

Everyone who was finally [[permabanned]] from [[Something Awful]], found [[Ogrish.com|Ogrish]] too tame or are trying to latch onto the webwhore in-crowd call /b/ home.  Pedophiles who have crawled out from [[not4chan]] come here to post and collect kiddie porn, but they usually do not last long, as posting CP is a [[permaban]]nable offense. If you're having trouble finding a [[proxy]] for your trolling activities that's not banned from 4chan, it's because the pedos have already gotten them all permabanned by posting CP. But then, why would you want to; trolling /b/ is like pissing into an ocean of piss. They usually retreat to [[420chan]] or [[12chan]] after that, as posting [[CP]] is common practice on those sites' /b/s.

Posting [[shitting dick nipples]] in /b/, however, is NOT a bannable offense and is welcomed with open arms and [[masturbation|fapping hands]].

/b/'s cracked-out mods frequently sticky their [[crap|own posts]], attempting to create their own [[meme]]s, sometimes spamming stickies until the entire board is just a place to view the [[admin|mods']] stickies. Whiny /b/tards have been begging [[Moot|Doug]] to unban snacks ever since (even though it was constant whining to moot that got him removed in the first place).

If [[Goodnight Sweet Prince|a celebrity dies]], plz to be going directly to /b/ for the traditional [[goodnight sweet prince|eulogizing]] of the still warm - perhaps still alive - body.

However when you arrive at /b/ you will no longer see gore threads or any other threads /b/ had used to see about 4 years ago. You will get porn threads all over your face since /b/ is now occupied with [[13-year-old|cancer]] and of course [[Moralfag|moralfags]] ruining every lulz that has to be had. The reason they leech of of /b/ is because they are retarded enough to go to /b/ and look for porn instead of going to a [http://rule34.paheal.net/ nigger pornsite].

The biggest concern about /b/ is now camwhores. Those black person have grown rapidly since [[newfags|kids]] like pr0n alot and mysteriously get affected by those things dark magic and end up bumping threads and giving camwhores attention.

/b/ does [[nobody likes you|not like you]] unless you show some [[tits or GTFO|tits]].

Since the furry population has started raising again, /b/ gets filled with furry threads. Waste of hum-furry rebels decided to go against furday and started making furthreads and injecting /b/ with a small dose of cancer. Thus making furday cease to exist (however /b/ gets raped with old fashionable furthreads on furdays but this time its anal).

However, nobody should ever listen to Urban Dictionary because they are a bunch of elitist, self-important niggers who like to make up words. The best way of describing /b/ is by comparing to ED, as follows...

{{quote|[[Unwarranted self importance|/b/ is sorta like a blind drunk downs syndrome child wielding a chainsaw, whereas ED is like a omglazer guided lulbomb]].|DLB}}

{{quote|<youtube>tRpcqr89f0E</youtube>|[[Picard|Captain Jean-luc Picard]] of the U.S.S. ''Enterprise''.}}

The only definitive thing that can be summed up about /b/, is that each and every single one of the users is an asshole, and damn proud of it.

[[Shit nobody cares about|You have just entered the very heart, soul and life force of the internet. This is a place beyond sanity; wild and untamed. There is nothing new here. "New" content on 4chan is not found; it is created from old material. Every interesting, offensive, shocking or debate-inspiring topic you've seen elsewhere has been posted here, ad infinitum. We are the reason for "not safe for work". We are the Anonymous Army. Cross us and you will fail. Anonymous is everywhere. You depend on us every day. We bag your groceries, we fix your computers. Anonymous sees you before you see him. Sitting at desks around the world right now is a nameless, faceless, unforgiving mafia composed of the best of the best, the worst of the worst and most people in between.

We are 4channers. The people devoid of any type of soul or conscience; we are products of cynicism and apathy, and we spread those very sentiments daily. Anonymous is the hardened war veteran of the Internet. He does not forgive, nor forget. We have seen things that defy explanations. We have heard stories that would make any God-fearing, law-abiding citizen empty their stomach where they stand. We have experienced them multiple times and eagerly await their return.

4chan is a place of sheer genius and utter stupidity, and there is often a thin line dividing the two. Here you will see a state of mind that exists in most human beings, but is rarely, if ever, shown. This is a place where taboos do not exist. 4chan cannot simply be regarded as a simple website or imageboard. It is so much more than code. 4chan is alive and constantly changing. This is a subculture, a self-governing sect of the world, rich in history and foundation. To become a 4chan user is to speak a different language, and to leave behind any methods of conventional thinking you once knew.

There are things here that you will not understand and things you never will understand. If you cannot accept this, then you should leave now, because there is no turning back.]]

[[300|This is 4chan, this is /b/.]]

== Likely Threads ==

Here's a list of 15 threads you are likely to see upon coming to /b/, with no less than 5 per page. No particular order.

Test it out for yourself! It's fun!



*[[Boxxy]] thread (Because [[Stalker|strange obsessions]] and [[Retard|social retardation]] go hand in hand)

* [[Spam]] threads, easy to spot by the strange links and the canned [[Lie|"OP you are so awesome"]] responses that bump the thread until it gets b&

*[[Trap|Traps]] thread (Because /b/ can't ever get enough [[cocks]])

*[[Triforce]] thread (Where you prove how much of an [[newfag]] you are)

*[[You Laugh, You Lose|You Raff, You Ruse]] (Average of 2 actually funny, [[OC|not stale posts]])

*[[Omegle]] chat (So you can spout as many memes as possible to other retards who do the same thing back)

*[[Camwhore|Camwhores]] (Where faggots suck up to [[Troll|non-existent women]] hoping for some sort of [[Imaginary girlfriend|cyber relationship]] since they [[Virgin|can't get shit in real life]])

*Stale [[Copypasta]]

*[[Irony|Hilarious]] spinoffs of [[Advice Dog]] (Like the very witty [[Pokeparents]] or [[Advice Dog/Variations|Courage wolf]]...really clever!)

*A controversial current affair (with extra trollage)

*A random nation/area report-in (so you can gather in one big stupid clusterfuck)

*Lots and lots of anime. This goes with out saying, because you can't be a true [[You|social reject faggot]] without an (un)healthy love for [[Lolicon|childish Japanese cartoons]]

*A '[[Rage]] you lose' thread...usually with links to a [[13 year old boy]] on [[Youtube]]

*Porn. Often with encouragements to drop 'fap folder'. Who keeps a fucking 'fap-folder?' Why, [[You|retards]], of course!

*Fap roulette...spice up your love life.

*A Great Debate Thread (Where Eurotards flamebattle Americunts about having their dicks mutilated at birth, videogames are discussed [[Serious Business|very srsly]], Americans try to defend their beloved country from jealous insults, and [[Trolls trolling trolls |trolls troll trolls]] while pretending to be religious

*<strike>A meet and fuck thread because [[/b/tards]] are only willing to fuck other /b/tards because most of them are social rejects anyway. [[Basement dwellers]] post their city and find somebody else who lives close to them to hang out with, most of the time pretending they're attractive, when the pictures they post are probably ones gathered from their [[facebook]] friends.</strike> A shitty new board has been created exclusively for these kinds of cancerous threads called /soc/.


All of these threads are scattered with large numbers of posts where you call each other [[newfag]] for pretty much any reason, or none at all. Because to be an [[oldfag]]
is a massive achievement, and you don't want just any old newfag coming along not knowing about stuff on the internet.

==Friday the 13th - LOLSCRIPTS==
On June 13th, 2008, 4chan came one step closer to the final solution. A [[script kiddie]] decided to post a script for others to follow its instructions and save it in to Notepad. When the script runs, it posts the guide in a thread on [[b/|/b/]]. The final result was a barrage of lulz and resulted in the newfags that fell for it and didn't know how to stop it getting [[Banned |b&]].  This cycle would reoccur several times thereafter, ensuring that half the posts on /b/ at any given time are [[spam]].

===9 Debbie Lane Brockport New York===
On the morning of August 29, nearly every post on 4chan's [[B|/b/]] was "hey guys, add my AIM: Moderntopia, also come Molotov my house at 9 Debbie Lane, Brockport, New York - who else has a race car bed? I do!!" or "I am spamming your shitty website and there's nothing you can do about it faggots, if you're man enough come fucking get me - 9 Debbie Lane, Brockport, New York"

All there is to say is [[Script_kiddie|LOL SKIDDIES]].

{{quote2|maybe the nearest /b/tard should go round there, and ask if they know anyone who's enough of a cunt to spam their address on a message board.

I'd guess there's a 90% chance they know exactly who's doing it, and an equal chance they have access to a gun, or a heavy blunt object.}}

==Second Civil War==
It has been noted that the Second Civil War of the U.S. was flamantly discussed by /b/ users starting on Friday October 10th, 2008 and continues to be debated on from time to time in new threads.

==/b/ Day 2008==
On October 26, 2008, a bunch of [[Script kiddie]]s caused /b/ to crash. Refugees began flooding /x/, /d/, /v/ and /n/, bringing the cancer with them. The /k/ommandos began a counter-offensive, striking the /b/tards out of /x/. /d/ was left to rot. Refugees from the affected boards streamed into /a/. As of the 27th, the cancer is once again contained to the smoking shithole known as /b/.

== The 100M Fail==
Most of Sunday 30 Nov. was spent by /b/tards trying and epically failing to "Get" 100,000,000 (100M). Moot and the oldfags, as usual, moaned about how failboating /b/ had become, and how GETs now meant nothing. This was promptly ignored. 100M ended up being the largest failget in history. It was taken by the furries, closely followed by the britfags.

==[[chemo|The Day /b/ Died]]==

[[Image:Anontalk_kills_b.jpg|thumb|'''KAYLA > KORAX''']]

<i>See also: [[Anontalk.com#Operation_Antfuck:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back|Operation Antfuck]] & [[RAIDCHAN]].</i>

On December 13, 2008 /b/ came to a grinding halt after hundreds of [[newfags]] deserted the sinking ship as it was getting walloped with a tsunami of spam [[chemo]] from [[RAIDCHAN]] including the familiar '''KORAX > YOU''' and some '''KAYLA > YOU''' for good measure. For a few glorious hours, /b/ was almost as good as it never was; /b/tards didn't have to bump their own [[posts]] and [[threads]] didn't [[404]] in 30 seconds.

==[[Boxxy|The Third Civil War, 10/11 January '09]]==
On the 10 January, every other thread on /b/ was something to do with [[Boxxy]]. Newfags were hailing her as [[Fail|'The Queen Of /b/]]. [[Newfags|Oldfags]] Bawwed, and declared war on the [[Idiots|boxxy supporters]]. Due to the mods failing to [[Banhammer|take action]] against the cancerspam it was decided that [[anhero|an hero]] by DDoS was the only [[Fail|effective]] option. Despite over 9,000 camwhores joining in the campaign against Boxxy by providing an epic number of tits, [[DDoS]] was called for at 00:00 GMT, 11 January '09. Shortly after mods blocked all posts to the site claiming [[lies|img.4chan.org down for maintenance, posting across all boards is temporarily disabled]] before the entire site [[404]]'d, when actually Anonymous pwn'd the servers. Following the Civil War, saying "Boxxy" causes insta-ban. 

[[Image:Jan10maintain.PNG]]

==/b/ DDOS's itself==

[[Image:Advice-moot-DON'T-BLAME--REDACTED-.jpg|thumb|The true face of the attacker.]]

From 5th May - 12th May 2009, /b/ and some other boards grinded to a halt and then went offline. For the many basement dwellers who live their entire lives, dicks pressed against palms, lurking on 4chan, this was an unthinkable disaster.

At first, it was thought 711chan was the culprit, but it was found later on that they were not behind the attack. moot confirmed that he made a mistake by blaming them. [[Moot]] rectified this, and on May 5th, the attack had been confined to the .zip and .img sections. As of May 7th, .img remained under attack. The refugees had invaded and occupied /x/, /gif/, /an/, and /d/, the residents of which wanted them the fuck out. 

No plan for vengeance had been hatched at this point. And as for the stalwart defenders of the boards, the [[k/|/k/]]ommandos, they were temporarily out of commission, and had decided not to try to clear up the shit that was filling /x/. Until the attacks on all areas had ended, /b/ and some other boards would have continued to remain offline indefinitely.

[[Image:Ddoschan.jpg]]

In the end, it turned out the culprits for the 4-5th day offline period were a bunch of morons who blindly downloaded files from links spammed around /b/. This nasty piece of work installed a Trojan that raped the shit out of the available bandwith, effectively DDoS'ing /b/ and the other affected boards without the infected users even fucking realizing it. Since the 12th May, /b/ is back up. Well, it is until the next cloud of retards who will download shit from /b/ without a second thought, and then proceed to gutfuck the forums.

One thing can be for sure: Newfags are to blame.

==[[Twilight|The Twilight Appreciation Station, 1-2 June '09]]==

[[Image:XKCD_on_Twilight.JPG|thumb|<s>Rules 1&2? Never heard of them.</s> The rules only apply to /b/, and are stupid anyway.]]

On June 1, [[Moot|moot]] in his wisdom renamed /b/ the ''Twilight'' Appreciation Station in a blatant attempt  to get [[Xkcd|Randall Munroe]] to notice him. Some lulz were produced by [[Troll|''Twilight'' fans]] discussing the merits of the film/novel and thereby causing [[Anonymous|the peanut gallery]] to respond with their usual [[Rage|wit]] and [[Fail|insight]]. As with most of moot's [[Forced meme|hilarious pranks]], the ''Twilight'' Appreciation Station produced a rare moment of universal [[Facepalm|agreement]] between /b/tards both old and new.

==/b/ DDOS's itself Part 2 : A Clockwork Orange==

[[Image:Fucking spam on B.jpg|thumb|One of the pictures used for the spamming.]]

On the 5th of July, 2009 some [[cunts]] from the 
[http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/making-money/59902-who-has-4chan-posting-script.html Blackhatworld.com] forum, or [[moot]], started spamming a [[faggot|rainbow]] of images of the main character from ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', each a different color than the last. This continued for a few hours, and then eventually slowed down. This started up again later on in the day with a new image, and then stopped once more. The Spammaggedon then started AGAIN with a new image on the 6th, and seemed to continue most of the day. It then stopped at 8:30 PM EST. On the 7th, all zip boards were being attacked with the same image from the 6th. Many ziptards flocked to /b/ asking what the fuck was going on.

Many /b/tards rejoiced at the stopping of the spam, but some missed it. Some saw it as [[chemo]], and discussed it even after it had ended (it would have been fucking impossible to have discussed it meanwhile anyway). Some gave the [[shit]] names, such as Orangesunday, [[faggot|Rainbow]]Alex, but Fucking Spam was decided. As soon as they missed it, it started again, as well as on the zip boards (except for /ck/ for some reason) its all over fucking /b/ again. After the shit began again 4chan remained inaccessible for a great deal of the 7th. 

A day later, new shit came to light suggesting the recent episode of ass fucking of 4chans bandwith, and as a result the shutting down of our beloved /b/, was due to a Trojan disguised as spam that numerous halfwitted faggots had downloaded. Again. Then, on July 10, 4chan and /b/ were <strike>back up and fully functional. All systems are go.</strike> Not any more /b/ is down once again. [[Eurofag|18/7/09]]: The clockwork orange pics were posted so many times that they became a meme. Protip: Repost them as many times as you can. Everyone will congratulate you on posting a hilarious meme and you will be welcomed into the folds of old faggotry with open arms.

See: ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]''

== /b/ Implodes on [[Delicious caek]] ==
:''See also [[4chan fgt hat day]].''

On October 1st, 2009, /b/ had an orgasm of [[over 9,000]] which resulted in a strange kind of meltdown. /[[b/]] was forced to flee to /[[x/]] [[truth|as they always do when /b/ is down]], as well as other faggy boards. With [[newfags]] unsure of how to fap and /b/tards trolling other boards, there were much [[lulz]] to be had. Ultimately /b/ was revived, and the lesser boards would rejoice. It is said that the birthday hats were the cause of the meltdown, but who the fuck cares. A while after it was fixed, it broke again, leaving /b/ frozen and /b/tards flooding the lesser boards again. A few hours later, all boards on img.4chan.org became unavailable, most likely because of the doings of [[Anontalk]].

== /b/ZZZZZZZZZ day - 6/15/10==
On June 15th, moot decided rename /b/ to /b/ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ, and to pierce all of our ears with the sweet sound of the Vuvuzela, also known as the nigger horn. A sound file played that said, "Hey, wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?", then proceeded to play the fucking flat B that the nigger horn makes. <s>As of now, it has not been removed.</s> It's gone, thank god.

<strike>To stop the faggotry, in Chrome, turn off everything in Options-Under the Hood-Content Settings, and in Safari, disable Plug-Ins under Security in Prefs</strike> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]. Get AdBlock and block derp.swf

==GMA Week 7/20/10==
[[Image:B-GMA2.png|center]]
Since [[Jessi Slaughter]] and her hick parents being on GMA, M00t thought it would be a great idea to dress /b/ up for such an occasion including the GMA theme looping as a .sfw in the  background, many a newfag became confused with the constant looping while oldfags relaxed with the safety of AdBlock, Firefox or Opera.

But wait... [[Operation /b/ipolar]] was enacted, causing a horrible mixture of lulz and chaos, which spilled across some of 4chan.

And then... [[Rape|RAEP]]! One of the worst spambot attacks in history meant that a thread lasted a whole 19 (Nineteen) seconds before it was removed. Even /b/tards couldn't stand this, and oldfags, newfags, and summerfags all evacuated in a mass diaspora. 4chan's /c/, /v/, /vp/tr/, and /r9k/ were partially taken over, while /x/ received its WORST RAID EVAR. With /x/ as the de facto /b/, and only a few /b/tards still in /b/, anarchy, lulz, and horror continued throughout 4chan. Ended in the evening, all was well, but raids against the sources of the bots commenced.

== The Day /b/ Died Again (CAPTCHA wars) (28/07/2010)==
<strike>On this particular day, M00t decided to place a verification CAPTCHA (for the lulz)
to EVERY SINLGE GOD DAMN MOTHER FUCKING POST.

/b/ has re-appeared again....we were so close

HTML DOODZ of the last thread http://www.mediafire.com/?dg50zekjipugczy

== So where did the Oldfags go? ==
It is confirmed that many of /b/'s [[oldfags]] left and went to neighbouring boards after they detected the slow decent into [[FAIL]]. Some of these boards are /tg/, /k/ and /x/ which are near impossible to troll on, You will either be ignored or saged instantly. Most of these boards also have [[nazi]] moderators  now which makes it even harder as any content thats not related to the board gets instantly Banhammered. 


== /b/'s Official Anthem ==
It’s a rare condition, this day and age,
To read any good posts on the 4chan /b/ page.
Lolz and memes of the grandest kind,
Some oldfags say it’s even harder to find.
Well then there must be some OC too
Inside these cancerous threads

Cause all I see is a tower of memes
Real lolz burstin’ out of every screen.
As days go by, we’re gonna fill our /b/ with lolziness.
The newfags may cry,
We’re gonna smother the cancer with ragefulness.

When days go by, there’s lolz for you, lolz for me,
For cool stories an opportunity.
As days go by, It’s the bigger lol of the legiony.

== 12/28/10 [[Moot is Olev|MOOT IS OLEV]] ==


[[File:NOBLOCK.jpg|700px|thumb|center|[[music|FUCK IT I'LL JUST LET THE MUSIC PLAY ALSO I SUCK AT SPELLING]]]]

In the early hours of the morning on December 28th, [[moot]] once again went completely [[batshit]] [[insane]]. 

/b/tards furiously f5ing their favorite imageboard suddenly found a new header claiming that "[[Moot is Olev|MOOT IS OLEV OLEV IS MOOT]]" and "where is your god now -or- write moolev on your body!!!!". Confusion abound, threads were made demanding the meaning of this strange new header. 

As if to answer the questions, [[moot]] shifted into '''MAXIMUM OVER[[TROLL]]'''! 

The color scheme of /b/ was switched to the much [[lulz]] eye-burning red and yellow. If this wasn't [[unfunny|hilarious]] enough, the song Cotton-Eye Joe began to play on repeat. Cries of "OH GOD MY EYES" and "why moot why" could be heard around the world.

===brb, ddos===
Moot's faggotry was fairly short-lived however, when the whole of 4chan joined the ranks of MasterCard, Visa and Paypal etc. and ground to a halt from a [[DDoS]] attack. It is back as of 11pm GMT, 28/12/2010, though may be running slowly. Some [[moralfag]] [[skiddie]] wanker named [http://twitter.com/th3j35t3r# th3j35t3r] claimed responsibility for the attack, though he's probably talking shit as there's no way he could take down 4chan on his own. Stupid fuck.

UPDATE: It was later figured by [[oldfags|/b/'s finest]] that the site was taken offline to perform chemo on the cancer (and also for moot's own lulz). 

Since moot made the comment about the site being DDoSed, it has made some news sites wonder if /b/ is still the unstoppable force it was once thought to be.

===>>300000000 GET DDOS===
Right before the [[GET/Post 200M#300,000,000 GET|300000000 GET]] the site went down again. Either moot has gone into ultra troll mode, or some moralfag got real butthurt over some /b/ shit. Either way faggots everywhere are raging.

=1/17/11 - The Day of Darkness=
<s>So moot has decided to be a total fuckhead once again, and has totaly lobotimezed the asshole of the internet by: 
making the title /b/lack
Making a insanely shitty black song which is just a terribad remix of eye of the tiger.
The entire screen is fucking black like niggers.
you can't fucking post shit.

I don't know what the fuck moot is thinking but this is one helluva way to lose traffic to 7chan or some other shitty *chan</s>
''' Butthurt faggot'''

Everything's back to normal, with a notice that some boards were removed.  And the XXX filter has disappeared.

===1/31/11 ***WARNING***==
On the 31 of January of this year m00t plans to lead all of his over 9000 dildo spammers on to AE. apparently they don't like us.. WHERE EVER YOU ARE ADMINS-just beware
