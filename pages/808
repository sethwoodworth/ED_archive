Badlydrawnjeff


'''Badlydrawnjeff''' was an [[aspergers|aspergic]] [[failure|hipster]] who edited [[Wikipedia|TOW]] from an iMac which he carried around to be hip. He would put it in the corner of a dingy failure of a coffee shop and furiously edit Wikipedia until he was kicked out each night.  Without writing several pages about this worthless person, it is impossible to express what a vainglorious skidmark this asshole was.

His main goal was to make sure TOW had articles for every single internet [[meme]], because if the [[419|child in Africa]] does not have painstakingly in-depth coverage of the [[Star Wars Kid]] then we have all failed, amirite? He called himself a "pop culture devotee" which is sort of like a fat chick calling herself big-boned. The truth was he was a sperging faggot who fancied himself a hip product of his generation.

Then one day the Wikipedo admins took a break from [[pedophiles|child rape]] and [[furry porn]] and realized that [[nobody cares|nobody gave a shit]] about those unfunny videos [[your mom]] finds on [[eBaums]]. So they started deleting articles. Badlydrawnjeff was [[rage|'''not pleased''']]. He had grown jaded and discontent with writing articles about books for 12 year old girls ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bratfest_at_Tiffany%27s&diff=prev&oldid=135626849] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Clique_(novel)&diff=prev&oldid=135628984] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gossip_Girl&diff=prev&oldid=135916788] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Clique_series&diff=prev&oldid=136077829]) and furiously reverting vandalism on the [[scat|Cleveland Steamer]] article ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cleveland_steamer&diff=prev&oldid=136052995]). He was fond of articles on internet memes, because he was the sort of empty-eyed hipster wannabe who desperately wanted to sound knowledgable. He would often read and re-read those articles while clapping his doughy little hands with joy. So he tightened his Ninja Pirate Faggot LOL So Random Headband and with a squeaky-voiced cry of "FOR THE LAUGH OUT LOUDS" he got ready to fight the tyrannical system of Wikipedia.  When a dictionary definition article called "Dust bunny," which was predictably about dust bunnies under beds, was hauled into AfD, he cried "'''strong keep'''!" and rewrote the article so that it was just a bigger dicdef, but big enough not to delete.  Were it not for this act of heroism, Wikipedia wouldn't have an entry explaining what a dust bunny was.  Jeff had no idea how they were formed, because he doesn't know anything about IRL matters, so that information is absent from the article.

{{quote|Badlydrawnjeff is [[USI|known to all]]. While he is a [[lie|highly respected]] and [[no life|prolific]] [[failure|editor]], his [[Aspergers|consistent commitment to legalistic process]] and his [[Shit nobody cares about|extreme inclusionism]] are notorious.|Doc Glasgow 22:06, 2 June 2007 (UTC)}}

When Badlydrawnjeff saw that the Wikipedos had hauled him into [[ArbCom|TOW Court]] he was horrified. Then he also saw that they were going to ban him from editing biographies of living persons, because he edited their entries as if he were on ED instead of TOW, de-emphasizing anything positive and making the subject look like a fool. The horror was too much to bear. He let loose with a shriek that broke the windows of the coffee shop he edited from. He committed [[Wikicide]] on the spot. Then he came to this encyclopedia and tried to turn it into TOW with more bad words. That dream predictably failed, because nobody here gave a shit about [[sauce|sources]] and being reputable. Fuck off, Badlydrawnjeff.
