Kewian/Reaction Log
This is an IRC log of [[Kewhale]]'s initial reaction to seeing her article.

  < Fairlight> Initial version:  http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Kewian_the_Welfare_Whale
   * Fairlight makes redirects now.
  < kewians>  YOU PUT MY PICTURE ON IT.
  < kewians> you bastard.
   * LilBrudder is trapped under 404s!
  < LilBrudder> Help!
  < LilBrudder> Hrlp!
  < Fairlight> My parents were married for two years before I was born.  Try again.
   * LilBrudder chokes out, "Help...me...!"
  < LilBrudder> Help!
  < kewians> i will consult a lawyer this week.
  < PlaidSquirrel> i looked on there for kewhale a long time ago but nothing came up
  < kewians>  YOU better get rid of that
  < PlaidSquirrel> why did you make the title so long?
  < kewians> does everyone think this is acceptable?
  < Fairlight> Because Kewhale and Kewian are redirects.
  < Fairlight> You can complain to the ED management to have it taken down.
  < Fairlight> They'll probably remove it.
  < kewians> slander and defame me like this ... and you had no permission to put it there. I will.
  < LilBrudder> It took you two hours to write THAT?
  < LilBrudder> I could've written it faster!
  < Fairlight> No, it took me two hours to look up all the formatting shit.
   * Fairlight doesn't do wiki stuff often.
  < Fairlight> Also, if you think you can do better...
  < Fairlight> ... it's a wiki.
  < LilBrudder> Nah.
  < Fairlight> OH.
  < LilBrudder> It's open-editing.
  < LilBrudder> I'll let someone else get it.
  < Fairlight> I forgot to put the log of Kewhale demanding that I not do it.
  < rohina> Ambular to Game 1
  < MrFalor> rotfl "Kewhale with her not yet then dead convict husband and whalespawn."
  < MrFalor> Good grief she's fat.
  < MrFalor> I feel so sorry for her husband.
  <@Pescado> I dunno, it looks like a proper ED article to me.
  < PlaidSquirrel> why is the pic all washed out looking?
  < PlaidSquirrel> and where did you get it anyway?
  < LilBrudder> Because it is "old"
  < LilBrudder> Kewian showed SOmeone in here, and then pes got it and saved it, and then Fairlight go tit.
  < PlaidSquirrel> ahh
  < PlaidSquirrel> maybe she should have shared through pm if she didn't want just anyone to have it
  < LilBrudder> It would've gotten out.
  < PlaidSquirrel> anyway she just looks regular overweight
  < PlaidSquirrel> why's that?
  < LilBrudder> Not that much, either.
  < LilBrudder> We're hardly a gated community.
  < PlaidSquirrel> ??
  < PlaidSquirrel> well yeah but that is why i said pm
  < LilBrudder> YOu generally can't trust peple.
  < PlaidSquirrel> course i guess it just depends on who she was sharing it with
  <@Pescado> This is Internet.
  <@Pescado> If it's anywhere, it's everywhere.
  < kewians> there was no way I saw this coming back then.. I did not know Itlight existed
  < LilBrudder> See?
  < LilBrudder> The internet will always come back to haunt you later.
  < Fairlight> Page updated with a log of Kewhale making the page happen.
  < Fairlight> Squitter, you're wrong about the picture.
  < Fairlight> Kewhale gave it to me herself.
  < kewians> I just deleted the shit and its back?
  < PlaidSquirrel> how did you delete it?
  < LilBrudder> It's a wiki.
  < kewians> If I cant get this gone by tomorrow  I will get a goddammned lawyer
  < kewians> edit
  < kewians> this is defamation and slander asshat
  <@Pescado> Heh, someone else has gotten into it.
  < PlaidSquirrel> it looks the same to me
  < kewians> no permission was given to use that image
  <@Pescado> Some Eppigy guy is now involved.
  < PlaidSquirrel> dumping cache i guess
  < LilBrudder> I'm in there!
  < LilBrudder> aww!
  < LilBrudder> Pes, where is the Eppigy?
  <@Pescado> He's an ED user that has joined the fight.
  < PlaidSquirrel> it still looks the same to me
  < Fairlight> Eppigy only reverted Kewhale's vandalism.
  < LilBrudder> Where?
  < LilBrudder> Ah.
  < Fairlight> You see, this is why Wikis work. ;)
  < PlaidSquirrel> do you have a new link?
  < PlaidSquirrel> or did you only update one or something?
  < LilBrudder> neighbor 0.75IFireIOilI1.0IFireIIFire
  < LilBrudder> Oh, whoops.
  < PlaidSquirrel> they are all the same right?
  < LilBrudder> http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Kewian_the_Welfare_Whale
  < Fairlight> Hey Kewhale, can I give you a little tip?
  < Fairlight> Your alterations don't delete old data, so all I have to do is wait for you to stop and then revert it.
  < PlaidSquirrel> ahh fug it
  < PlaidSquirrel> i have cleared private data including cookies and it still looks the same
  < LilBrudder> Try hitting F5
  < PlaidSquirrel> i'll just look again tomorrow thanks
  < PlaidSquirrel> it is bedtime anyway
  <@Pescado> Haha.
  < LilBrudder> DO IT NOW!
  < kewians> please get rid of it... I dont deserve public humilation in front of the whole world.
  <@Pescado> Random people are joining the fight to revert Kewhale's vandalism. :P
  <@Pescado> At this point you can't stop it, Kewhale.
  < LilBrudder> What is this "Bedtime?"
  <@Pescado> People are joining the fight on their own.
  < kewians> nobody cares about me..
  <@Pescado> People who don't even KNOW Kewhale are recognizing Kewhale's attempts at vandalism.
   * Fairlight nods.
  < PlaidSquirrel> it all looks the same to me so i am missing the whole fight
  < Fairlight> Why do you think I encouraged her to demand her picture be taken down?
  < kewians> How can I do this?
  < PlaidSquirrel> how can you do what?
   * LilBrudder has a fuzzy feeling from being in the log.
  < PlaidSquirrel> oh the pic
  < kewians> contact someone
   * PlaidSquirrel is bummed cause she can't see the log
  <@Pescado> Heh, you know, they already HAVE a category for users.
  < LilBrudder> Tomorrow morning.
  <@Pescado> Kewhale has a category of user already:
  <@Pescado> #  OMG Butthurt: You have an article about you on ED, and you want it gone. You may wish to refer 
  to this to avoid making yourself look like a 'tard before visiting ED:REMOVE
  < LilBrudder> PS: HIT THE DAMN F5 BUTTON!
  <@Pescado> Eppigy has already told you not to remove content. :P
  < Fairlight> What's really funny is that if you visit that page, you will find that Kewhale's attempts fall under 
  "How not to do this".
  < kewians> eppigy can go fuck itself
  < PlaidSquirrel> fine i did
  < LilBrudder> Okay.
  < LilBrudder> Better?
  < PlaidSquirrel> you are khalnath?
  < kewians> im being made fun of in all directions.. Im asking for help... I used the edit buttons they provided..
  <@Pescado> If the target of the article attempts to vandalise or blank it, that creates lulz, so please make sure 
  that the subject knows what you said about them.
  < PlaidSquirrel> kewians don't sweat it
  < PlaidSquirrel> i can see wanting your pic down but i wouldn't bother to fight the rest
  <@Pescado> It's funny, Kewhale is doing exactly what she needs to do to guarantee that article STAYS.
  < kewians> IM SERIOUS  as a heartattack I can make a case for a lawsuit.. lawyers will do it for publicity and 
  the internet is not a place where you can defame someone
                 for no good reason.
  < Fairlight> Right, because she's stupid.
  < kewians> YOu better remove it now.
  < notovny> No, they won't do it for this.
  < kewians> I may not get them but I can get you.
  < Fairlight> http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Internet_lawsuit
  < kewians> this is humilating.
  < Fairlight> That's the general idea, yeah.
  < kewians> You have no idea what this feels like.
  < Fairlight> Wrong.
  < LilBrudder> And I quote:
  < LilBrudder> 2. Threats. You may find it surprising to hear that ED is familiar with threats of all kinds. 
  White Hat threats, lawsuit threats, rape threats, FBI threats, death threats. They don't work. Plus you 
  lose any sympathy you might have had, and
  < kewians> Now im being made fun of.
  < Fairlight> What do you mean NOW?
  < Fairlight> You weren't before?
  < Fairlight> StupidSquirrel:  Did you read the log?  My intro blurb says it's me.
  < kewians> I SAID I MAY NOT GET DRAMATICA BUT I CAN GET YOU FOR MALICE.
  < kewians> THIS WAS DONE MALICIOUSLY.
  < kewians> YOU ADMITTED IT.
  < kewians> REMOVE IT
  < Fairlight> Fuck no.
   * LilBrudder dives under table to hide from t3h caps.
  < Fairlight> Remove it yourself, it's a wiki.
  < kewians> iM TRYING TO.
  < PlaidSquirrel> i only mention it because that name was in the matrix log too right?
  < Fairlight> Oh, wait, I forgot. They won't let you. :)
  < Fairlight> Oh yes, that's me too.
  <@Pescado> Laugh, there's a defamation template.
  <@Pescado> This user (Defamation) is a whiney defamation bitch. You can help by assassinating their 
  character more thoroughly.
  < kewians> SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO LOG..
   * Fairlight rofls.
  < Fairlight> Stop it, you're killing me!
  < PlaidSquirrel> what program do you use?
  <@Pescado> http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Template:Butthurt
  < kewians> you can be tracked down because Im suing you.
  < rohina> kewain, let it go.
  < rohina> He only did it because you said you would sue.
  < Fairlight> Isn't there a Pseudonymous in the Sims community?
  < kewians> mirc
  < kewians> I want it removed.
  < PlaidSquirrel> then i do not know
  < LilBrudder> Yes, Fairlight.
  < rohina> Also, he has not included a lot of stuff he could include, and no doubt if you goad him, 
  he will put it all in there.
  < kewians> How would you like your children ridiculed that way.
  < PlaidSquirrel> look in your options i guess
  < PlaidSquirrel> or copy paste to notepad
  < Fairlight> http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Kewian_the_Welfare_Whale&action=history
  <@Pescado> Kewhale, I don't think you understand that your efforts to try to remove your article..
  < Fairlight> The user who undid the last two revisions is "Pseudonymous".
  <@Pescado> Is the sort of thing that makes ED love it more.
  < Fairlight> Shush.  Don't help her.
  < MrFalor> ahaha
  < MrFalor> Stupid Kewhale.
  <@Pescado> Maybe you should just make an insulting article about Fairlight. :P
  <@Pescado> Except it would be boring and get deleted for lack of lulz.
  < Fairlight> There'd be more lulz from the edits I'd make than from Kewhale's content.
  < Fairlight> I'd post making fun of myself and ensure I tagged everything I said with my signature 
  so it's clear that I said it.
  <@Pescado> Heh:
  <@Pescado> "PROTIP: To defeat the Cyberdemon, shoot at it until it dies."
  < LilBrudder> XD
  < MrFalor> Great tip.
  < Fairlight> Oh yes, most excellent. :)
  <@Pescado> Gotta love statements of the obvious.
  < Fairlight> All this talk of Kewhale has made me need to take a shit.
  <@Pescado> I mean, would anyone who had gotten that far in the game to encounter one not have that 
  idea down solidly?
  < Fairlight> Please add to the page.
  < Fairlight> Oh, Kludge, you should link to it from kewian.mustbedestroyed.org.
  < Fairlight> Cyclical linking FTW.
  < LilBrudder> XD
  < kewians> Ive sought the correct editing help.
  < Fairlight> Yeah, good luck with that. :)
  < kewians> as soon as I remove it it goes back up.
  < Fairlight> Yes, that's because the ED people don't like your behavior.
  < kewians> Im not going to stop if I cant get a lawyer to listen.. I will try the civil libeties union, 
  some politician someone to gripe about violation of my privacy and no free speech protects that.
  < kewians> I approached them politely and got innuendo and crap. and my name fucked with
  < Fairlight> Oh?  What'd they do?
  < kewians> what do you think?
  < rohina> Well you just please PLAY YOUR TURN.
  < rohina> And also, kewian is your Real Name?
  < Fairlight> Ahahahahahaha!
  < Fairlight> User talk:Pseudonymous
  < Fairlight> From Encyclopedia Dramatica
  < Fairlight> Jump to: navigation, search
  < Fairlight> Thanks for the help with Kewhale's page. Are you the same Pseudonymous from the Sims community?
  -- Khalnath 22:10, 10 June 2007 (CDT)
  < Fairlight> Yes, I'm that Pseudonymous. I don't really consider myself a part of the Sims community anymore 
  since I don't play the blasted thing and I outcast myself from it by posting Zippocat. 
  --Pseudonymous 22:20, 10 June 2007 (CDT)
  <@Pescado> It's Misterpaper!
  < rohina> But that are Mr Paper!!!one one
  < Fairlight> In that case, MisterPaper fucking rules.
  <@Pescado> It's funny...
  <@Pescado> Kewhale is getting all bent out of shape despite the fact that her actual name is never mentioned.
  < kewians> THAT IS MY REAL PICTURE... used without my consent
  < kewians> nor the consent of my husband and child
  <@Pescado> Kewhale, do you really want it removed and replaced with the butthurt template?
  < kewians> It sure was in that chat room
  <@Pescado> That'll make it worse.
  < kewians> do you let people invade your privacy?
   * Simsbaby pokes.
  < kewians> This is NOT free speech. My rights have been violated.
  <@Pescado> No, but you also don't see me posting my picture on the Internets.
  <@Pescado> When you put it for public view on photobucket, you can't be too surprised if people use it.
  < kewians> well shit..that was done..like the others did..showing what they looked like innocently..
  < kewians> It does not give permission for use as shit like that.
  < kewians> Maybe an injunction order can be issued on this. something of that nature.
   * Fairlight plays a violin.
  <@Pescado> I don't think it'll happen.
  <@Pescado> Plenty of other people have been mocked.
  <@Pescado> people with more money than you.
  < kewians> I wont know until I try ..will I?
  < Fairlight> Did you not read the page about Internet Lawsuits?
  <@Pescado> Go lolsuits.
  < V> Anything you submit to a public forum becomes public property, kewian.
  < Fairlight> Oh, wait, I've got a great page that demonstrates why Kewhale will not get anywhere with her lolsuit.
  < kewians> written by juvenille delinquents.
  < Fairlight> http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/An_hero
  < kewians> so this gives everyone the right to abuse and humiliate my family who DID not give permission for that 
  picture to be used.
  < Fairlight> If they couldn't get THAT page taken down, do you really think yours will be?
  < kewians> you know what I might contact them and see if they are still litigating and if they are... I bet they 
  are ... perhaps a class action can be formed.
  < kewians> Thanks.  oh and youre not off the hook asshat.
   * Fairlight shakes in his boots.
  < Fairlight> Oh no, I pissed myself because I'm so afraid of Kewhale's imaginary lawyer!
   * V passes Fairlight some tp
  < kewians> remove the picture..
  < Fairlight> No.
  < kewians> this has gone too far... everyone tells me take it.. fuck no.
  < Fairlight> Everyone tells you to just take it because unlike you, they are nonstupid.
  < Fairlight> They realize that clenching only makes it hurt more.
  < kewians> ok..who wants their picture uploaded without their permission to an asshole site to make fun of and 
  degrade you to millions of people.
  < kewians> prove your point..do it to someone else..
  < kewians> any volunteers? ...NO?  gee why am I not surprised.
  < notovny> Wouldn't volunteering be giving permission?
  < Fairlight> [URL DEPRECATED]
  < Fairlight> Go nuts.
  < kewians> probably
  < kewians> got great screenshots of it..
  < Fairlight> Screenshots of what?
  <@Pescado> Is Kewhale actually still trying to complain?
  < Simsbaby> Bluescreen Village.
  < kewians> I intend to find someone.
  < kewians> this is too much.
   * Pescado laughs.
  <@Pescado> GOod luck with that.
  < kewians> fun is fun..this is cruel.
  < Simsbaby> Beachball 'o Death Island.
  <@Pescado> Cruel fun is the best fun!
  < Fairlight> ... what's the difference?
  < kewians> the difference is I have a r ight to privacy and this is NOT free speech.
  < kewians> fuck internet politics.
  < Fairlight> How is it not free speech?
  < Fairlight> It clearly does not purport to be factual.
  <@Pescado> People richer than you have been blasted in Encyclopedia Dramatica, and nothing has been done.
  <@Pescado> How would you afford a lawyer on your welfare check, anyway?
  <@Pescado> And while you might be able to sue foreign entities in absentia, you certainly will never see your money.
  < Simsbaby> Vista Valley, Millenium City, Apple Town....
   * Fairlight nods.
  < V> Good night, all
  < jfade> hmmmm...
  < Amber> Night V
  -!- V is now known as V|Away
  <@Pescado> Death to Tuggles.
   * jfade ponders about how to best arrange these speaking bubbles.
   * V|Away dies, as directed
  < notovny> Hmm.
  < kewians> this isnt free speech
  < Fairlight> Yes it is.
  < rohina> Kewian, it isn't even about your real identity.
  < kewians> I dont give a shit about money now..all I want is it removed.
  < Fairlight> Not gonna happen.
  < kewians> My picture is a form of my identity and has a right to some protection.
  < rohina> make it funnier, and it will stay your version.
  < rohina> Fairlight's version isn't that great.
  < kewians> YOu would allow this to happen to you.
  < kewians> I only want the picture off now. and then maybe you have your point.
  < Fairlight> 'tis true.
  < notovny> People deface pictures of the President of the United States all the time.
  < Fairlight> It's a first draft.
  < kewians> thats not the same thing.
  < notovny> How was the picture obtained, anyway?
  < Fairlight> I asked for it.
  < kewians> I stupidly put it up when we were comparing photos...not knowing about fairlight at all.
  < Fairlight> Awhile ago.
  < Fairlight> Pfft.
  < Fairlight> It was like a month ago, so give that one a rest.
  < kewians> I had no knowledge of you at the time.
  < Fairlight> You WHAT?
  < Fairlight> Don't give me that bullshit Kewhale.
  < kewians> oh..wait..fuck I forgot...
  < kewians> just because you CAN do something does not mean you should... go yell fire in a theatre.
  < Fairlight> Oh, I LOVE doing that!
  <@Pescado> That's not much fun.
  < Fairlight> I can't do it anymore, though.  My voice is too distinctive and I always get caught.
  <@Pescado> It's funnier if there *ACTUALLY IS A FIRE*.
  < kewians> thats NOT free speech and NOT protected.
   * Fairlight laughs.
  <@Pescado> THEN you yell FIRE.
  < Fairlight> No, it's not.  But this is.
  <@Pescado> Because there ACTUALLY IS A FIRE.
  < notovny> Not a lawyer here. Can't really see this being a pro bono case.Closest one could come to is the person 
  who took the picture claiming copyright, but  Dramatica can calim fair use as a work of Parody.
  < kewians> Id categorize this as hate .
  <@Pescado> But it's not advocating any specific act of hate.
  <@Pescado> Besides, "hate" doesn't make it a crime.
  < kewians> This is abusive.
  <@Pescado> the KKK is still legal.
  < kewians> It should.
  <@Pescado> It remains legal to be a Nazi.
  < kewians> I can still seek an injunction on this.
  < Fairlight> Also, ED will remove the picture if you say it's you in the picture.
  <@Pescado> You can try, but I don't see it happening.
  <@Pescado> But then you will end up with something even more painful.
  < Fairlight> Shush.
  < notovny> Overal, my not-a-lawyer advice is probably to drop the subject until you have time to talk to someone 
  or someones who is/are Lawyers.
  < kewians> I think I may even try the civil liberties union... my rights are violated here.
   * Fairlight sniggers.
  <@Pescado> That'll work.
  <@Pescado> Go for it.
  < Fairlight> Please keep a copy of their response.
  < kewians> I gave no permission for a parody on me or my family.. and this was done with malice.
   * Pescado wants to see them laugh at you.
  <@Pescado> You don't GIVE PERMISSION for parodies.
  < Fairlight> I see Kewhale does not understand the concept of "parody".
  < kewians> Parodies have been stopped before.
  <@Pescado> When?
  < Fairlight> Parodies are free speech, Kewhale.
  <@Pescado> And was it actually stopped in a legal fight?
  <@Pescado> Or merely by intimidation?
  <@Pescado> Because I don't thnk you can intimidate ED.
  < kewians> This piece of tripe is done with malice and forethought.. it shows defamation
  <@Pescado> No, it doesn't.
  <@Pescado> It does not claim to be factual.
  < Fairlight> In fact, it requests additional nonfactual information.
  < Fairlight> Real person alert!
  < Fairlight> This article is biographical and about a real person with real feelings. You can help out by digging 
  up as much crap about them as possible and posting it here! This article must adhere to the extreme lulzing of 
  living persons at all times. Unsourced, factually inaccurate, poorly sourced or potentially scandalous material 
  must be added immediately.
  < kewians> You cant just print any type of crap against people and keep expecting the law to turn a blind eye\
  < kewians> Yes.. I got a nice big fat shot of that as well.
  < Fairlight> The fact that ED continues to exist is proof that yes, in fact you can.
  < kewians> not all courts will agree with that shit.
  < kewians> someone will listen to me. Your ass will be dragged in on this too.
   * Fairlight holds his breath.
  < notovny> Kewian. Talk to the lawyer.It's been established that Fairlight is  not going to do anything about 
  this, no matter what threats you make here.
  < kewians> Its ok.. here..but when you drag it out in front of the whole world  thats wrong.
  < kewians> I am.. sorry.\
  < Fairlight> That's true, you're a very sorry excuse for a human being.
  < kewians> you drop it too.
  < Fairlight> Drop what?
  < kewians> stfu
