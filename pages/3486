'''Greenpeace''' (also known as Greenfags) is an [[America|international]] [[terrorist|enviromental]] organization, started by some guy named [[fag|Bono]], with the stated goal of reducing human population to zero to restore GAIA's natural balance. It is therefore held in high esteem and actively funded by [[Al Gore]], [[Liberals]], [[Vegans]] and [[Nazis]] in general. 

Their current activities focus on [[ban fucking everyone|banning the light bulb from every household in the world]] as a first step towards breaking down the industrial infrastructure that supports the entire population in order to finally execute their [[final solution]] of the human problem.

==History==

Greenpeace was founded by a guy named [[fag|Bono]] [[at least 100|about 30 years ago]] to hide their drug smuggling operation, and it continued in this fashion for many years, but when the [[party van|FBI]] didn't get it's regular shipment of [[meth]] and came looking for them, Greenpeace had to look legitimate to avoid legal problems. So they brought in some enviro[[crazy|mental]]ists and [[ALF]] members.

The new recruits fucked up the good job that the group was doing, and stopped bringing vast quantities of [[jenkem]] and [[weed]] into the country; instead they started a mass campaign against the killing of innocent animals and saving the O-Zone layer. They pissed off every country that had a whaling operation, oil, nuclear power, nuclear weapons, [[guns]], and anything else that might disrupt the whale population.

Of course these goals where seriously gay, but they where allowed to continue because the Greenpeace members were good at hiding. Eventually, years later, the [[French]] found the location of Greenpeace boat "Rainbow Warrior" hiding near their nuclear weapons testing site, and decided the best thing to do was to blow it up. This caused [[lulz]] for anyone that Greenpeace ever pissed off. A [[Dutch]] photographer got blown up trying to get his photos off the boat, and got to feel the cold embrace of Death. Sadly, France's greatest  deed ever and the lulz were short lived, when [[fags]] from New Zealand found out about it.
France had to pay 2.3 million francs (about $100,000) in compensation to the photographer's family, and 23 million [[Internet Money|New Zealand dollars]] to New Zealand. They also had to issue an apology, which France faked, and became the worlds greatest liars.

Greenpeace became more sneaky after their run in with the French and decided to stay low for a few years but keep on Campaigning for more [[Beastiality]] and less French. They re-emerged from their eco-bunkers a few years later, to find the world a different place. They discovered that their [[WTC|operatives had done]] and started a war on oil producing nations, by fooling [[W]] into thinking it where the Arab that done it. Overjoyed by their success, they began getting media attention by sneaking through tightened security at places like airports, so they could protest about whatever crap it is they protest about.

==Camps==

Greenpeace and its splinter groups currently have a permanent residence outside Faslane nuclear submarine base in [[Scotland]]. They camp out there in the belief that can stop the UK from having nuclear weapons, or from firing them at furry bunnies or some shit like that. They camp outside the main gate because their boat  will be blown to shit (again) if it comes within 1000 miles of the base.

==Boats==

This is a list of ships in the Greenpeace Navy.

Rainbow Warrior STATUS: Destroyed  FRAGS: 1

Rainbow Warrior II STATUS: In Use

Rainbow Warrior III STATUS: Under Construction - the first purpose-built environmentally friendly craft in the Greenpeace fleet

MV Artic Sunrise STATUS: In Use

MV Esperanza STATUS: In use

Argus STATUS: Unknown

Moby [[Dick]] STATUS: Unknown

MV Greenpeace STATUS: Decommissioned -- Now a Museum Ship

[[irony|Greenpeace only seems to use boats that were once whaling ships or seal clubber transport vessels]]. They convert them for fitting in every environmentally friendly appliance possible, then set out, belching diesel fumes into the air. On some occasions the ships have done more harm than good, with greenpeace members throwing chemicals off the sides of ships, and accidentally ramming coral reefs. This is because no qualified Captain will work for them, and they can only get [[asspies|illegal Polish immigrants]] to sign up these days.

Fact: Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd (another earth-fag group, as seen in Whale Wars) fucking hate each other. If you ever come across a member of Greenpeace you can easily troll the fuck out of them by asking them how the hell they can spend so much money to acquire a world record holding speedboat only to let this happen:

Looks like the carbon dildo had plenty of time to alter course, but being vegansï»¿ they probably didn't have enough energy to turn the wheel in time.

==Greenpeacefags==
Apocalyptica is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[rap|cello metal]] [[band]] that supports Greenpeace. You can help terrorize Greenpeace by destroying Fagocalyptica at one of its [[orgy|gigs]], and outwardly bashing the band at its official forum, which [http://www.apocalyptica.de/forum/wbb/|  may be found here].

Their name suggests, that even if Greenpeace wins (which would be fail for us), their shitty [[faggotry|music]] will end the world anyway.

==Greenpeace canvassers==
Greenpeace canvassers are [[Fellatio|fucking cock suckers]] that have failed at life and cannot find better jobs for the summer. All of greenpeace's funding comes from the Jew 69% of the time, thanks to Greenfags canvassers. The group  consist of [[Attention Whore|Woman]] and [[Suicide_Girls|Man]], [[Marijuana|that cares about the enviroment]]. Their day starts off by [[Blowjob|meeting up with their supervisors in a coffee shop]] to retrieve the location of the day, afterwhich the canvassers  will start [[Asking_for_it|canvassing]] at the designated area. The canvassers believe strongly in their right to [[Marijuana|protect the enviroment]], and when hackled, will [[Crap]] on your face repeatly. It has also been mathematically verfied that 100% of the canvassers have [[Herpes]] 90% of the time, and their mission of life is to spread it by having the Jew signing up for [[Orgy|monthly donations]].

==[[Whale Wars|Sea Shepherd]]==

Sea shepherd is a [[terrorist]] organisation being [[butthurt]] about the environment in much the same fashion as Greenpiss only more [[hardcore]] and specialices on those poor, delicious chunks of fat and meat commonly known as [[food|whales]].

If you've seen [[Shit nobody cares about|Whale Wars on Discovery]], you know that they frequently get their asses kicked by [[azn]] whalers, obviously because the whalers are real [[sperm|seamen]] with proper equipment and paid work, while Sea Shepherd consists mostly of smelly amateur treehugging landcrabs with dreadlocks, getting [[buttsecks|assfucked]] for free by their [[USI|mentally challenged]] "captain".

Their fagship is known as "[[Steve Irwin]]", named after the [[insane|psychotic]] founder who broke up with greenpeace because they told him to STFU about ramming into boats because they had harpoons, and to worry about [[not|real]] environmental problems like nukes and [[cancer]].

==Trolling==
 
Greenpeace folks are easy to troll. Even mentioning 'seal clubbing' and how much you enjoy it, will get you some lulzy [[furfags]] turning into [[an hero|an heroes]]. A good place to troll them is on one of their message boards.  Mentioning Patrick Moore in any context is a sure-fire [[LULs]]-getter.

*http://forum.greenpeace.org/int/ You can start here and work your way through the rest, accumulating death threats and other pathetic attempts to make you stop trolling the pussies.

*http://www.apocalyptica.de/forum/wbb/ Another good way to troll Greenpeace is through one of its supporter's forum.
