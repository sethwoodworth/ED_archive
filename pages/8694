Unrelated links are links found on the internet that are [[lesbian|misleading]] or have nothing to do with the link word that they link from. This can be witnessed on pages created by [[roman shower|n00bs]] all over Encyclopedia Dramatica, who are unfamiliar with [[rape|how we do things here]], and thus, are [[dead babies|fags]].

==How to spot an unrelated link==
Well, given the infestation of [[buttsecks|13 year old boys]] on the site, it is [[not|almost certain]] that 90% of [[goatse|this]] is linked to just for the sake of it, and [[goatse|this]] has nothing to do with the word it linked from. So, everytime you see [[Goatse|this]] it is likely that [[goatse|this]] is an [[awesome|unrelated]] link. Now get searching and see if you can find [[goatse|one]]!

==Posting unrelated links?==
If [[You|you]] are posting unrelated links, you obviously are devoid of any sort of sense of [[black people|Humour]], or [[mudkip|life]]. You might as well [[butthurt|resign from ED forever and go back to your massive porn collection]].
