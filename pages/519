Evidently somewhat famous among the [[Fanfic lesbians]], {{lj|user=Anniesj}} rose to [[drama]] prominence on [http://www.livejournal.com/users/anniesj/331112.html October 27, 2004] with one of the all-time great [[LiveJournal]] [[comment whore]] posts: [[Image:anniesj.jpg|thumb|right|The original post which [[allegedly]] incited the wrath of Dubya and the Seekrit Service]]

<blockquote style="border: thin black solid; padding: 1em;">For all my LJ-loving friends, this is a word of warning, a word to the wise, and a word of utter exhaustion after the wringer I've been put through in the last twenty-four hours.<br><br>

A couple of weeks ago, following the last presidential debate, I said some rather inflammatory things about George W. Bush in a public post in my LJ, done in a satirical style. We laughed, we ranted, we all said some things. I thought it was a fairly harmless (and rather obvious) attempt at humor in the face of annoyance, and while a couple of people were offended, as is typical behavior from me, I saw something shiny and forgot about it, thinking that the whole thing was over and done and nothing else would come of what I said.<br><br>

I was wrong.<br><br>

At 9:45 last night, the Secret Service showed up on my mother's front door to talk to me about what I said about the President, as what I said could apparently be misconstrued as a threat to his life. After about ten minutes of talking to me and my family, they quickly came to the conclusion that I was not a threat to national security (mostly because we are the least threatening people in the entire world) and told me that they would not recommend that any further action be taken with my case. However, I do now have a file with the FBI that includes my photograph, my e-mail address, and the location of my LJ. This will follow me around for the rest of my life, regardless of the fact that the Secret Service knows that I am not a threat.<br><br>

Obviously, I cannot link to the original LJ post that I made, because I have removed it from my LJ to protect myself and those who commented in that thread from receiving any further visits from the FBI. I apologized for the miscommunication, though I did *not* apologize for voicing my opinion of George W. Bush. I will never apologize for speaking my mind. I will, however, apologize when I say something wrong way and for unintentionally offending/threatening someone, because I am an extremely nonviolent person.</blockquote>

The post received [[9001|5000]] comments (including several pages of assorted [[Dramacrat]]s just generally [[troll]]ing things up) before she finally disabled comments, but, to the dismay of many people, has not yet [[An hero|disabled her life]].
