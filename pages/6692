Puppy Pitcher
{{FYI|The girl has [http://www.inquisitr.com/83848/puppy-drowning-girl-found been nabbed in Bosnia!]}}

'''Puppy Pitcher''' is a [[Bosnian]] girl from Bugojno made famous for a video in which she throws a bucket of puppies into a river one by one. The video was originally featured on [[YouTube|JewTube]], but has since been pulled [[no shit|because of its content]].

<video type="liveleak" id="bb4_1283184704" width="420" height="360" frame="true" position="center"/>

==How it Started==
[[File:Screenshot_YouTube_DogThrowing.jpg|thumb|Thumbs up if you like puppy torture!!1!]]

[[File:Original_puppy_killer_post.jpg|thumb|The post that started it all. This is the brother of the girl throwing puppies into the river.]]

On Monday, August 30th, the original video was linked on /b/ with the text "Plz /b/, flag this video". Soon the [[moralfag]] witchhunt began. Much to the disagreement of many /b/tards who got many lulz out of the video. She was described as 5"6'-5"8', blonde, green eyes, [[Caucasian]]. It should be noted that the lack of [[cats]] present seriously hampered search efforts, as apparently [[Lol|even puppies are fair game]] for most of [[b/|/b/]].

{{quote|On Friday police in the sleepy Bosnian town of Bugojno announced they have identified the puppy killer and her parents, but we cannot reveal her name due to legal issues. According to some unconfirmed reports, she is just twelve years old, which means that she cannot face criminal charges and she cannot be officially named as the culprit, as all criminal investigations involving juveniles are confidential. However, under Bosnian law her parents, identified only by their initials M.P. and M.P. could be faced with a fine of up to €6,000. Under the current penal code, some forms of animal abuse are punishable by short prison terms, but as the girl is apparently under fourteen, this does not appear to be an option.|[http://www.fudzilla.com/home/news/latest/police-nab-puppy-killer source]}}

==The Failed Operation==
The operation was met with nothing but moralfaggotry and fail, becoming the worst operation since the [[R9gay/Raid|/r9k/ "raid"]]. Most of the "suspects" have been either trolls giving false information or just plain [[Fail|guessing]]. Anon became bored of the moralfags fail and moved onto more lulz worthy things.

In retrospect, well meaning moralfags ruined a thirteen-year-old girl in [[Croatia]] for no reason. This is pretty much the opposite of the moralfag doctrine, and thus makes them better than if they had succeeded in their mission. Failing at failing = success.

[http://blog.peta.org/archives/2010/08/girl_throws_puppies_in_river.php PETA] offered a $2,000.00 reward for information leading to the arrest of the puppy killer, which is ironic considering this video would is pretty standard footage in one of their [[propaganda|recruitment videos]].

Additionally, Michael Bay, yes [[Transformers|Michael fucking Bay]], wrote on his [https://michaelbay.com/newsblog/newsblog.php website] that he would reward $50,000 for information leading to the arrest and successful prosecution of the Bosnian hoodrat and the person who shot this act of cruelty.

Since a police station seems to have found her mostly on their own, it is unknown if the money will even be paid. [[Some argue|Sources suggest]] that PETA will dodge out of the bet since they didn't get a chance to utilize [[murder|their own methods]]. Michael Bay probably has enough [[money]] to pay for three seconds' worth of CGI in one of his terrible films out of his pocket.

=== First Wrong Suspect: Katja Puschnik ===
At first, [[moralfags]] thought that the chick was Katja Puschnik from [[Nazis|Germany]], however it became obvious that this was just shit made up by a fail troll [[NYPA|trying to use the Internet as his personal army]]. After languagefags and a [http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=hr&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.24sata.hr%2Fnews%2Fpsiholog-ova-djevojka-bi-mogla-zlostavljati-i-ljude%2F188812%2F&act=url Croatian newspaper] confirmed that [[an hero|our hero]] is speaking Croatian with the accent of a [[troll|Bosnian]]:

<center>{{morphquote|PPtroll|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|Dear White Knight, 
stop reverting. I know that it is her, also as I said before I know she owns this sweater. Be satisfied that someone wrote "unconfirmed", although it's definitely her!|[[User:DerEwigeJude|DerEwigeJude]], preparing to lead her to epic ruin.

|Well it's definitely her, I recognized her, because I was at school with her! Also, I know she owns this red sweater! Bosnia Herzegovina is an error!|[[User:DerEwigeJude|DerEwigeJude]], giving away the fact this was originally a disguised attack article.

|Guys, I made a terrible mistake. I was really believing that it was her, but it isn't. It was because of the similarity and the red sweater she was wearing. You still have to admit that it could have been her, when you compare the pictures. The argument with the accent and some other things convinced me, that it can‘t be her. PETA, please don‘t kill her or pillage her house. Katja, please excuse me for spreading all your personal information and making you this kind of famous. Encyclopedia Dramatica, please delete all information about Katja Puschnik and /b/ don‘t send a thousand of pizzas to her home, make any creepy phone calls or fap to her pictures! Katja, I hope you forgive me. Shame on me, that I thought you would be the girl with the red hoody, throwing nine puppies into a river and laughing while doing it! You have been always so kind to your Icelandic horse Gisli, how could I ever think that you would do bad things to animals? I also remember what you said about things like that at Leitzach. So again, I try anything to make my mistake undone!|[[User:DerEwigeJude|DerEwigeJude]] experiencing troll's remorse.

The very same publication alludes that the girl's brother posted on a [[shithole|Croatian forum]] about the incident, [[lol wut|defending the puppy drownings as "humane"]]. Finding this [[Sock puppet|brother]] could yield the puppy killer herself.

=== Second Wrong Suspect: Antonia Miskic ===

[[File:Antonia_Miskic_-_puppy_killer_twitter_pic.jpg|thumb|The vacuous face of a puppy killer. (lol wrongly accused, my bad)]]

[[Epic fail guy]], the mascot of this mission, quickly tracked down a girl in the wrong Yugoslavian nation. The below Croat was flooded with shit despite the girl who actually did the crimes [http://www.fudzilla.com/home/news/latest/police-nab-puppy-killer being in Bosnia and having a last name starting with P].
 
The alleged puppy murderer, Antonia Miskic, is tagged in a picture on a friend's Facebook: [http://www.facebook.com/album.php?profile=1&id=1634112135#!/photo.php?pid=1045144&id=1634112135&ref=fbx_album This one].

Her name used to be linked to her [[Facebook]] profile, but since the video was [[stolen|leaked]], it appears as though she has [[baleeted|deleted]] her profile.

[[for the lulz|Why would an innocent girl feel the need to do this?]] Possibly because she got shit-stormed with a bunch of messages saying "ZOMG PUPPY KILLER YOU MUST DIE!!!"

Here's a list of the accounts that Antonia has deleted or disguised since being [[fail|(wrongly)]] outed:
* <s>[http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1404342845 Facebook]</s> Deleted.
* <s>[http://twitter.com/antoniasaywhaa Twitter]</s> Deleted.
* [http://www.myspace.com/AnToNiA510 MySpace] - Disguised (which lists her as sixteen years old)
* [http://www.facebook.com/people/Antonia-Miskic/100000892193855 Facebook again] - Disguised (name changed to NIsam Ja and with a [[fake]] profile pic put up)
 
In addition, by searching her name, Antonia Miskic, on Facebook, you can find various fanpages populated by [[hivemind|moralfags]] stating their disgust for her in several languages. [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Antonia-Miskic-Getta-Cuccioli-Di-Cane-Nel-Fiume-Devi-Fare-La-Stessa-Fine/154774544533775?v=wall&ref=ts 1], [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Antonia-Miskic-la-pute-quon-reve-degorger-4CHAN/148006851889322?v=wall&ref=ts 2]

The Facebook lynch-mobs seem to be disappearing as quickly as they sprung up.

===Third Wrong Suspect: Dragana Adzaip===
[[File:Dragana_Adzaip_possible_puppy_killer.jpg|thumb|left|The trail leading to the other suspect.]]

[[File:Dragana_Adzaip_facebook.jpg|thumb|Dragana Adzaip - Would fuck.]]

Some say that the puppy thrower is a different Bosnian girl named Dragana Adzaip. Like Antonia Miskic, this woman was found to be connected to [http://www.facebook.com/nani1711 Martin Mufc-Nani Gaspar], who is believed to be the cameraman of the video, or a friend of the cameraman of the video. There is speculation that this is person who was commenting on the Croatian forum mentioned in the original Croatian newspaper report. As this girl is actually in Bosnia, this is a possibility. Her last name does not start with P, so this remains unlikely.

===Current Suspect: Ivanka/Ivona Pavlovic===
Although it isn't quite clear yet how the name was obtained, this appears to be today's suspect. A leading Bosnian newspaper has published an "exclusive" article after discussion with the family of one very upset Ivona Pavlovic (aw...bless). The whole family is named and some are pictured. Interestingly, a brother of the suspect is called Martin - a name many believe to be the cameraman's, as a "Martin" posted the original JewTube clip which kicked off this huge shitstorm.

If you disregard all of the speculation and Facebook lynch-mobs and all he said/she said [[bullshit]], you can [[Jessi Slaughter|backtrace]] to some of the original [[reddit]] threads where the investigation was actually going in the right direction (meaning before [[4chan]] got involved). The original video poster, Tarankula, had posted on a Croatian gaming forum. The reddit guys then found some of his other posts and profiles, and located an email for him [mailto:trulex47@live.com trulex47@live.com].

==The Queen of /b/?==
It is common knowledge that [[over 9,000]] threads regarding this were made on /b/. At one point, some [[newfag]] declared Puppy Pitcher the "Queen of /b/". [[DO NOT WANT|Anon's response was predictable.]] 


==The Lie about the Happy Ending==

[[File:Alive puppies lol u mad.jpg|thumb|right|lol ALIVE U MAD BOSNIAN HOODRAT??]]

Some Croatian news site is reporting that 5/6 of the puppies survived and were rescued by some old woman. The warm-hearted lady claimed that she fished the puppies out of the river. They are however drinking up to three liters of milk every day, and she is very poor, so please donate money to save these poor puppies. Awwwww. If you actually open your eyes, you will, however, see that the puppies in the video and the ones the old woman "rescued" are not the same.

You can find the article [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=hr&u=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/stence-koji-su-baceni-rijeku-spasila-je-baka-ruza-clanak-186868&ei=F9yCTM-1J4HWtQPug-D2Bw&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ7gEwAA&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/stence-koji-su-baceni-rijeku-spasila-je-baka-ruza-clanak-186868%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff here].

Later it turned out that the story about having saved the dogs was made up to protect the puppy pitcher, who happens to be the direct neighbor of the old lady.
