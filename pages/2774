F.R.O.G. is an abbreviation of French, Russian or Greek, used by {{lj|user=seeker_of_thule}} amongst others.

You don't know who this is because you are [[american|lucky]], but the dumbass who coined this term evidently had no idea that as an umbrella term, it [[suck]]s.  For starters, being [[Greek]] can't be all that bad, the weathers good all year round, the [[women]] are [[hot]] until the age of about 35, when for some reason they all grow [[lesbian|beards]].  French is only slightly worse (unless you mind being called a "[[french|cheese eating surrender monkey]]" or putting up with [[centipedes|female armpit hair]]). At least the food that isn't made of frogs is [[pussy|edible]] and provided you order it [[terrorist|well done]] your steak may not still have a [[necrophilia|pulse]]. Granted, being [[Russian]] has gotta suck, it's fucking [[Brandon Crisp|freezing]], you live in a [[crap|brick shit house]] and the only things you have to look forward to is [[vodka]] and [[slut|filthy]] bitches with permanently erect [[tits|nipples]].
