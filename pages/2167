'''Dejimachan''' is a [[Dutch]] [[chan]] which was created by a [[Bullshit|bullshitting]] and [[Autist|terminally stupid]] member, [[Sovjet Nederland]] moderator Jedi-Mocro, <s>after Sovjet-Nederland went offline because of internal and financial problems</s> and Sovjet Nederland was [[gg|finally released]] from the [[newfag]]got clutches and [[fail]] that is now headquartered in Dejimachan. This was specifically been rejoiced by many  delusional SN folk and is considered the most [[lie|win]] moment of [[2010]] not considering that they've jumped on a bandwagon that has already seen its share of world tours, crashed in a ditch and got sold already.

==Origins==
[[Shit_no_one_cares|After Sovjet-Nederland went down]]. Since his departure from SN, [[Attention_whore|Jedi-Mocro]] decided that he [[You_don't_have_any_friends|had to jump on the bandwagon and create his own obnoxious chan]]. 
Although Sovjet Nederland lost some users, not a fuck was given that day since no one gives a shit about chans anyway, he made clear that he wanted to start all over again, and the only reminiscence of Sovjet Nederland would be that anonymous users are nicknamed [[Henk de Vries]] - call it the Dutch [[Anonymous]], and his own vision of what Sovjet Nederland should've been: [[bullshit]].

==Media coverage==
Dejimachan was covered on [http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2010/09/dejimachan_achter_halsemabedre.html Geenstijl], [[Lie|a relatively popular Dutch satirical news site]], for supposedly housing a person that threatened Dutch politicians via Twitter. The administrators made clear however, that Dejimachan [[Faggotry|"does not condone such actions"]].

In a recent event on 11th November 2010, Dejimachan was once more issued in the aforementioned website. This time Dejimachan was given the "Dutch [[4chan]]"-title ([[wat]]), which gave Jedi-Mocro a raging boner. [[Unrealistic_expectations|An attack of sorts seems imminent from worldwide sources.]]
