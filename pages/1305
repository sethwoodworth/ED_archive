'''CampusBlender''' was the original college social network.  No longer online it was a well conceived [[college]] messageboard network on the [[Internets]] for college students around the US. The [[fgt|creators]] have moved on from the project which served its purpose of connecting college students on and offline well before TheFacebook started spamming college email address.  

The codebase was donated from the original college network, The Wolf Web, based in North Carolina State University: [http://www.thewolfweb.com/].
