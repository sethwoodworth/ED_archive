'''Spaghetti in my Southbridge''' is the latest shitty forced meme to arise from 4chan's [[g|/g/]] board.

It all started when [[anonymous]] took apart his Archos Gmini and posted an image of it, he asked if anyone knew what was wrong with the circuit board. It appeared that a peice of spaghetti (perhaps even a [[Flying Spaghetti Monster|noodly appendage]]) was laying on the southbridge - possibly shorting it.

Cries of [[forced meme]] started just 40 minutes after the thread's creation, when [[anonymous]] said "this has meme potential....". This particular poster was declared a [[faggot]] by the rest of the users for ruining the first original thing to come out of [[g|/g/]] in a long time, and thus relegating Spaghetti in my Southbridge to the dark, moist halls of forced meme status. Whether it is technically "forced" is still open to debate.
