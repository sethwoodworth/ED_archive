<font size="3">Domestic violence is when a perfectly fine and functional male member of society puts his [[woman]] in her place: The Kitchen.</font>
<BR><BR>
Domestic Violence usually occurs in two easy steps:

1.Woman is NOT in the kitchen.<BR>
2.Man directs her to the kitchen using all available methods.
<BR><BR>
It's seriously that easy! Do try it at your home!

==History==

[[rihanna|All women]] secretly -or not so secretly- love being [[Falcon Punch|slapped around]] and '''domestic violence''' is simply the [[foreplay]] for [[rape|rough sex]]. Domestic violence is also the bestest way to show your woman how much you love her and is the [[Semen|'glue']] needed to prevent any lasting relationship ending in severe [[butthurt]]...[[Shit nobody cares about|(at least for her anyway)]]. 

It's always warranted whenever a female speaks, refuses to take orders, leaves the kitchen, looks at another guy or [[Chris Brown|checks your cellphone for other females]]. It's funny as hell too, as sung about by [[Anal Cunt]], in their hit "Domestic Violence Is Really Really Really Funny." Stick it on, then have your friends get popcorn and beer, and they can watch you learn her good.

[[Some Argue|Recent studies now suggest]] that between 80-90% of [[bitches]] did actually [[asking for it|have it coming]], with an additional 10-20% pretty much [[asking for it]]. This comes as a shock to everyone but longtime [[surprise sex]]-advocate [[Mike Tyson]] who has apparently known this for years.

Actually, it's a bit surprising [[ WTF|WHY it's even illegal in the first place]]. From the first seconds of the astounding births of males, the genetic code of knowing how to keep a [[ kitchen|bitch in her place]] already flourishes. So, this can only mean one thing. Those goddamn [[fugly]] [[lesbian]] [[feminazis]] persuaded the [[drunk|shitfaced]] and majorly stoned congressmen of the law with VERY [[pussy|persuasive speeches, letters, actions, and other things women use to change people's mind.]] As written in the [[rules of the internet| Constitution]], " '''any of thou written, even in the shittiest of thy excuses, any of thou shit that thy not maketh sense any particular, any of thy shit written that makes women plead thy rape- IF IT IS WRITTEN! - it shall not be blemished by the marks of erasement. AMEN, AMERICA.'''"

===Battered Men===

Feminists stubbornly deny that domestic violence is also committed by women against men (50%-50%), because they want to keep a monopoly on eternal victimhood. 

The males who enjoy domestic abuse from women have an SM fetish. The males who tolerate domestic abused by their girlfriend/wife do so out of desperateness. For their loser status and lack of game means they cannot attract better women in their lives.

During childhood they were traumatized for constantly being ordered around by their moms, are very attracted to control-freak abusive women so they can relive their hellish youth.

When an abused male comes home after a hard day of work, he can't relax, but must fulfill his second-job as sweatshop slave and punch bag of his dominatrix. 

Battered males get slapped hard by their wives whenever they refuse to do any dirty and dangerous work around the house to serve the entitled princess' neverending list of demands.

Abused husbands keep their sad, private life a secret to avoid being ridiculed for being a doormat or not being taken seriously by captain save-a-hoe cops.

==Criminalization==

After a few thousand years of being [[lulz|beaten and terrorized]] by abusive spouses, as well as being forced to listen to [[retard]]ed jokes about it, domestic violence was made illegal. Once freed, they realized [[no|they could kick the shit out of assholes who were asking for it]]. 

Women were now faced with an important choice, stop domestic violence for all genders or only penalize [[smart|stupid]] [[awesome|violent]] [[MTF|men]]. They chose to go with the latter [[stupid]]ity and [[violence]], cause women get turned on by slapping their husbands during disagreements when they run out of logical arguments. 
Anyway, women screwed up everything since man created rap and most recently reggae ton, so some women are still beaten, yet beaten men are brushed under the carpet and put on ignore. (SmAcK dAt bItCh yO)

==Domestic Violence in the News==

**"The jury is weighing whether that revelation could have thrown O'Toole into a fit of rage so outrageous that she drugged Slaby, waited until he fell asleep, then glued his penis to his stomach, his testicles to his leg and his buttocks together. O'Toole said it was part of a sex game -- so was the nail polish, which she said she used to paint sideburns on him in honor of Elvis."

==Warning==
Domestic abuse can cause serious injury. Without suitable training as well as proper protection, serious damage can be done to the hands, elbows, knees and forehead. Thankfully there is a much easier way.

==Domestic abuse for gays==
Because it's just a fight between two people of the same sex, no one really gives a shit unless it requires repeated trips to the hospital. You can also [[lulz|abuse your partner in public and people just think you're friends]].

Best thing about [[gay]] couple domestic abuse is that it's much easier to get away with. Who's going to go to the police and admit they got beaten up by a fag?
