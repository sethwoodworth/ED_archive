Furtopia
[[Furtopia]] is a [[furry]] webhosting community owned by Gene Angel (WhiteShepherd) and has existed in part or in whole since 1998. The website itself hosts a variety of crap, including an [[IRC]] Server, [[Shit|MUCK]] server, forum, paintchat, and various other shit like a radio show.  

==Forums==
The [[Furtopia]] forums cover many aspects of a [[furfag|furfag's]] life within the furry fandom. Various ares include:

* "Lifesylers" - The furfags that [[wolfaboo|claim to be wolves]] and want to end up being like [[stalking]] [[cat]] in a few years. Home to the many "Do you wish you were an anthro" topics.

* "Furries on Furry" - Where [[furfag]]s talk about what furry means to them. Also home to many "Are you in the furry closet" and "is it okay to have a dozen murrrsonas?"

[[Kathera Lockharte]] also has her little area in the Art section.

==The Night of Goatse==
Furtopia's forums had many flaws besides the fact that IT WAS A FORUM FOR FURRIES. There were a few very large security flaws with the system as well, apparently running on a 5-year old version of their forum software. Essentially, the security hadn't been updated in half a decade.

One of the few awesome trolls within the furry fandom exploited this. [[supercutefurri]] decided to single-handedly destroy the forum in all it's entirety simply for the lulz.

{{Quote|99.9% of the entire attaxx and database zipzip happened the Night of Goatse. this was BEFORE the very first that LOLFurries ever heard of it. it was already GREAT SUCCESS before *anyone* could do a thing about it. well that's not exactly true, since it was a FIVE-YEAR-OLD SECURITY FLAW with FIVE-YEAR-OLD PUBLISHED PATCHES AND UPDATES running on a server COMPLETELY WIDE OPEN WITH NO PROPER OS ACCOUNT OR DATABASE RESTRICTIONS. lol you guys yall c'mon now it wasn't even a good hax0r. asking for it, perhaps? you should be glad it wasn't someone who actually hated you :P.|[[supercutefurri]] on [http://scf58.livejournal.com]}}

The entire situation led to the entire Furtopia community to place blame on LOLfurries until WhiteShepherd could point out who was to blame.
