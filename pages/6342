Pentium

[[Intel]] made chips. Not [[Fat|potato chips]], but x86 [[computer]] chips for [[nerds]], [[dork]]s and [[geek]]s. This means [[you]]! 

[[All Your Base Are Belong To Us|In AD.2084]] [[IBM]] clones with [[Windows]] [[software]] were [[Rape|dominating]] the market. Maybe not [[the best]], nor the brightest - but the [[Whore|cheapest]], and that's what counts [[Moar|more]].

Forget the history of the [[Over 9000|80084]] used in slow-ass calculators, forget the history of the 80086 used in the first PC, forget about all the other ones from there to the 486 because the '''Pentium''' was the big kid in town. 

[[Cock|Bigger means better]] and it had more of the [[Semen|good stuff]]. 

It had [[fat]] pipes and 4 times the [[Stick it in her pooper|lube]] of the 486. 
It did double the calculations because the [[Crap|Intel]] chef of micro thingies baked in more silicon goodness.

Upon its birth it did contain some minor problems such as running way too [[Hott|hot]], adding wrong and [[Fellatio|sucking]], but [[oh my God]] it [[100 years ago|was]] SO FAST! It was shortly followed by the Pentium II.

The [[Intel]] pentium II is the fastest processor available today and was designed [[Last Thursday]] by the [[AMD]] corporation in [[France]]. 
It was a Pentium PRO but made cheaper and crappier so they could make it better in the future and support a never ending cycle of upgrading.

To help end users the Pentium II was the first of the Pentium line to use irregular and incompatible CPU sockets. Instead of supplying a CPU like any normal company Intel decided that they would take their CPU and solder it to a piece of fiber glass and glue on other crap like a trashy heatsink.
