N00dz
[[Image:Spooge.gif|thumb|An example of handy MS Paint skills.]]
Naked pictures, [[allegedly]] of the poster, posted online.  Usually either produced as a byproduct of [[camwhoring]] or carefully-orchestrated [[fat girl angle shot]]s and [[Internet disease]].

==n00dz as a drama-generating technique==

Currently, [[sexting]] is the premier [[DGT]] using n00dz.

Apart from that, keep these rules of thumb in mind when [[DGT]]ing with n00dz:
* Whenever anyone posts a n00d ever, [[save]] it to your hard drive. 
* After that point, whenever any of those people posts anything, post with their n00d.
* MS Paint skills are a plus, too.

Example: [[Zeriara]] posted her n00dz to stop a 7chan raid. An ED user copied them an uploaded them to ED. Now they are used as "picture unrelated" images on many imageboards.

And on the internets a piece of n00dz spreads quickly, as this video shows:<br>

By the way, you can't take your n00ds back once you post them. Anyone can see your n00dz.
