Period
A '''period''', otherwise known as cherry soda, is when a [[woman]] bleeds for two to nine days out of her [[vagina]] and fails to die. Most women say that 'it is natural' and that every woman has them, but this is a lie concocted by [[Whores|evil Jezebels]] and is actually a sign from [[God]] that they hath sinned and are going to hell after [[Jesus]] has skull fucked them. To try and hide the shame, [[Jews]] made tampons for them so that they can carry on with their evil ways. There are two types of tampons that a woman can buy off of a street dealer in exchange for TVs and [[Sega Genesis]]es: the first, soft totem poles that are shoved into the bitch's pisshole for the lulz and can also be turned into bombs, due to the fuses coming out of the bottom of them. The second are large white pads that are responsible for the death of [[Steve Irwin]] as they can be confused with [[Animal abuse|skinned]] stingrays.

{{quote|And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.|[[Yahweh]]|Leviticus Chapter 12:1-2}}    

{{quote|And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.|Leviticus Chapter 12:4-5, GOD}}

While some women would see the light and come to the light the Jesus for salvation, but some throw them in the bin for teenagers/creepy old men who have been watching too much ''[[Hellsing]]'', for them to [[steal]] and [[fap]] over. They are in the same league as panty sniffers and should be shot on sight.

Don't believe ED??? [http://hut.rox.com/pads.html CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!!!]

Of course, there are some of you [[sick fuck|sick fucks]] out there that would bastardize something as sacred as a bitch bleeding out her snatch.  ('''PROTIP''':  Menstrual blood works great as lube.)  That's where the term "Red Wings" comes in as can be found here [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=red+wings].  For the even more perverted fucks - there is MEATBALLING!!!  Meatballing: [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatballing].  Sick sons of bitches!  But you gotta admit - it's a great source of iron and protein!  MENSTRUATION [[FTW|FTW]]!!!

==Moontime==

[[Some argue|Some]] [[women]], who think they are neo-[[pagan]] Earth-mother-goddess-worshiping [[uber]] stupid [[hippies]], [[Denial|have decided that periods are really cool]], and the only reason other women don't think so is because they have been taken in by the '[[True|Period Disgustingness Conspiracy]]', a joint product of the Manocentric Maleocracy and Tampax Inc. These women call their periods 'Moontime' because like the full moon, it drives everyone fucking crazy. Some of them even go so far as to <s> [http://www.livejournal.com/community/blood_art/54657.html#cutid1 paint with their menstrual blood] </s> BALEETED, ensuring they will create a high-quality product sought after by art collectors such as [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] (and a strange smell for weeks to come).

99.9% of all women see the hippies as [[batshit insane]], because [[IRL]], it's not fun to bleed from your pussy and wear diapers for a quarter of the year, unless they have a webcam or join livejasmin.com. 

Although they're doing it wrong, these [[hippies]] are on to something, as mentioning your period is a fucking hilarious way to [[troll]] sexually entitled basement dwellers who think they're going to get to fuck you. Mention clotting for bonus [[lulz]]!
