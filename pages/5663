Nauru
[[Image:Nauru.jpg|thumb|A photo of the small nation of Nauru, overcrowded by refugees.]]

[[Nauru]] is a tiny island nation in the [[Sea nigger|South Pacific]]; in fact it's the second smallest independent country in the world (the smallest being the [[Pope|Vatican City]]) and doesn't even have a capital city. It is most famous for being the dumping ground of [[Australia]]'s would-be ruff-ugees.

Nobody knew that this island even existed until [[Australia]] designed the ''Pacific Solution'' and forced Nauru to provide holiday homes for its illegal immigrants until Australian lawyers make sure they get free housing and a living wage for being on a permanent holiday in Australia. Nauru was understandably pissed off about this, but large cash payments have kept the noise down to a dull roar. [[Liberal]]s (in American) were extremely pissed off by this 'cause Nauru relies on Australia to save it from being taken over by [[G.R.I.D.S.]]-infested [[gay]] pirates.

Since [[last Thursday]] Nauru has officially stopped taking on more of [[Australia]]'s fake refugees in waiting. The island now has enough room for the [[sea nigger|citizens]] to reproduce without anyone falling into the surrounding water.
