'''Advertising''' is the [[Hookers and Blow|promotion of goods and services]], usually paid for by the [[jews|providers of said stuff]]. If [[Jew Gold]] is the root of all evil, then advertising is the fertiliser. Advertising is also the #1 product of America. In fact, in the age of [[NAFTA|free trade]] and everything [[shit|Made in China]], advertising is about the only thing that America actually makes any more. Accordingly, advertising is the de-facto 'gasoline' that drives the whole US economy and, in turn, that of the whole world. If consumers -the beasts of burden upon which [[capitalism]] is born are deprived of information as to the wealth of crap available to make them truly [[lies|happy and successful]] in life, then they will not know what to spend their hard earned, disposable income on and -in turn- deprive businessmen of obscene wealth.

Advertising also [[owns]] the Internets; the oil that lubes [[the tubes]]. Contrary to popular belief, the Internet is [[derp|not free]] and does not run on [[magic|fairy dust]]. For example, if you have a [[ED|popular, growing site]] that increasingly demands additional and larger tubes to deliver the abundance of [[lulz|product]] for a continually [[EDiots|growing audience]] -along with fully functional [[server|pumps and storage tanks]] for all the Internets- but can't find [[jews]] willing to part with [[money|their precious]] for [[niggers|whatever reason]], the [[Girlvinyl|site owners]] will be hard pressed to keep on providing finely crafted infotainment (such as [[lulz]], [[drama]] and [[LNN|happenings]]) out of their own pockets and the goodness of their heart. If the demand, then, overwhelms the supply, the tubes will [[ED is slow|start to back-up]] and eventually burst and necessitate the [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|cessation of services]] unless [[donations|alternative funding]] can be found.

Advertising is a method where a certain product or series of products are brought to the masses via various medias.
i.e: Radio, TV, Street adds and the colorful shit that is covering the shirt of your favourite soccer player. 

The basic idea of advertising itself isn't a bad one and there is nothing wrong in advertising your product to the possible buyers, how else would they know about your wonderful products, such as "easy toothbrush" and "Hawaii chair" (mentioned items can be found from this [http://www.esquire.com/the-side/video/five-useless-products link]).


==Abusing Advertisement==
In need to of moar monies and [[Jew Gold]], the marketing men and [[Whore|Women]] have developed various techniques to achieve said valuables, such as false advertisiment and junkmail. With these two great methods, the sales have skyrocketed and market now controls the goverments of the world.


By using this superior marketing technique, the salesman and big corporate bosses have build great bussiness imperiums.
This comes in 3 diffirent levels, depending on how bad the product itself is, since good products don't need such methods.

=== Level 1: Deceiving advertisement ===
[[File:Mcdonalds double cheeseburger1.jpg|thumb|left|this cheesburger seems to be much bigger and juicier than it really is]]
[[File:Unwrapper double cheese.jpg|thumb|right|reality]]
This is the least abusive method, wich is used to make the product at hand to appear better than it actually is by using various backgrounds and lighting mehtods, or using sexy females to advertise the product( if it is meant for me and vice versa)

For example, fast food restaurants use this level one method to sell their junkfood for the hungry masses.
This also aplies to many other products, from video games to household appliances.

=== Level 2: Misleading advertisement ===
[[File:Fap add.jpg|thumb|left|typical misleading mmorpg advertisement]]
[[File:Evony reality.jpg|thumb|right|reality]]
This is a very common method in the marketing bussiness, where the advertisement misleads the consumer with seducing images, even though the add itself doesn't always say anything misleading. 
There might be various misleading images such as half naked women( used most by mmorpg companies and jewtube fags), very muscular bodies( Bodybuilding supplements)or using a well-known celeberty( Demi Moore), or famous fictional character(every superhero ever) in their advertisement. At first glance this doesn't seem to be very effective way to increase sales, atleast for us normal people, but fanboys and girls buy literally ANYTHING that is promoted by their favourite actor/character.

-Wanna sell your new useless cola brand? Don't worry, just have some famous character drinking your shit(liek santa-clause, naruto or some fappaple material) and BOOOM, your sales go up like a horny cock, when all fanbois and galls drink your poisonous product made of battery acid and diherria.

=== Level 3: Outright lying about your crap ===
[[File:Britney spears diet ad 01.jpg|thumb|left|typical diet advertisement designed to cheat your monies]]
[[File:Worlds-fattest-man-in-the-world.jpg|thumb|right|before AND after the usage of miracle fat burn pills]]
The most desperate method of advertisement, usually used via junkmail and by the street peddlers in some third world countries, like Canada and Britannia.

Mostly used to sell you some fake products to make your penis grow 12inch and to give you the athletic body of David Hasselhof.
