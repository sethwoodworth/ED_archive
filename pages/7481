Shoopbill
[[Image:Shoopin.jpg|right|thumb|350px|The Original Shoop.]]
From the [[autism|autists]] who bought you [[Lioncash]] comes '''Shoopcash''' (or '''Shoopbills'''). This soon to be dead '[[meme]]' fails it because people (and especially [[Americunts]]), are essentially lazy and too cheap to buy the multi-coloured pens or crayons required to make a Shoopbill correctly.

==Shoop Bills==

Created by a bored New Jersey /[[b]]/tard not satisfied with making a mockery of the pitiful [[worthless|US dollar]] with crudely drawn [[lion|>:3]] [[emoticons]], they're already in circulation and awaiting the reviews of art critics in an attempt to raise the US $'s worth to more than a $ from [[Zimbabwe]]. 

They are [[jew golds]] with the [[SHOOP|SHOOP DA WOOP]] face emblazoned over a famous presidents nobody fucking remembers. Lulz ensue when drug dealers see the 'artistic' [[rap|dolla dolla bills y'all]] as the customer tries to pay for their dimebag of [[crack]]. 

A Shoopbill has, thus far, never been rejected so continuation of the creation of the Shoopbills has been encouraged by many [[MS Paint|artful]] /[[b]]/tards. There are many variations of the shoopbill such as the American Shoopbill and the Jynx Shoopbill featured on this page.

==WARNING==

Shoopbill creation is only for [[graphic art|artistic peeplez]]. Attempt at your own risk. Nobody wants to see your FAIL version of [[SHOOP|IM CHARGIN MAH LAZERZ]] fgt.
