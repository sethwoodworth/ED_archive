'''Spacehero''' was an incredibly lonely [[basement dweller]] named Samy, who had a [[shit]] [[MySpace]] with [[no friends]]. He decided to get some.

==Pre-worm==
Samy was one of those basement dwelling [[D&D]] losers on Myspace who [[srsly]] believed that friends on Myspace = friends [[IRL]]. After a period devoid of any additions to his friends list, instead of going [[emo]] and self-[[pwn]]ing, he decided to force people to befriend him like some sort of Big Brother [[sick fuck]]. So, using his [[uber]]-cool 1337 [[skillz]], he created a nice little script that would automatically add people to his Add Friends list and add him to their hero section in their hideous, disfigured, [[HTML]]-raped profiles. 

==I'm [[an hero]]!==
Samy, after many days deliberating and washing his favorite [[fursuit]], implemented his little script designed to add any [[fucktard]] who visited his pitiful profile, complete with annoying hardcore music and more. They would also unknowingly access their own settings, add him to their heroes list, and save it WITHOUT EVEN REMEMBERING.

After about an hour, Samy had [[over 9000]] Myspace [[whore]]s pending in his Add Friends list; by the end of the day, about 1 of every 35 users wanted to be his friend. Being the thoroughly [[retarded]] [[redneck]] twat he was born and raised to be, however, he pussied out after contemplating jailtime for "[[pedophilia|h4x0ring]] Myspace" and [[Delete fucking everything|deleted his profile]]. Of course, according to internet law, his IRL reputation joined him in the basement.

He was reported to have been [[pegging|peg]]ged by his girlfriend afterwards, as a lesson for being a big gigantic Myspace [[faggot]].
