Pooh's Adventures
[[File:poohjumanji.jpg|thumb|left|SEE DA CREATIVITY!]]



The '''Pooh's Adventures series''' is one of the strangest and most mystifying pieces of [[shit]] to emerge from the cesspools of [[Youtube]]. More pointless than [[AMV]]'s and with as much charm as a Lebanese hooker, this series has somehow avoided lawsuits and continues to prosper despite not being...prosperous. While some of these films have been removed by the powers that be, some have managed penetrate a smaller hole known as Vimeo[http://vimeo.com/]. These films aren't only about that diabetically cute [[Disney]] bear and his buddies, Tigger, Eeyore, Piglet, and Rabbit, oh no! These [[Olchai]] have to shove in a shitload of "guest stars;" it's abstract cock much more gargantuan than [[Cartoon All Stars to the Rescue]] or the "Imaginationland" Episode of [[South Park]]. In the world Pooh and his [[furry]] friends, nothing is sacred.

== From Humble Beginnings (Or Giving the Proverbial Finger) ==

Before this shitstorm of utter [[FAIL]], there was a humble Disney fan known as TonyWDA[http://www.youtube.com/user/TonyWDA]. His work primarily consisted of simple editing, such as changing the music in finales or adding laugh tracks. However, most would know him for his animated crossovers, which consisted of splicing various [[cartoons]] to react to a certain scene. Although these types of "Crossover" videos (usually consisting of animated couples from different movies) could be considered gay, retarded, and just fucking stupid, at least these showcase somewhat decent editing skills that contain a teeny bit of win. To say the least, these vids are mostly harmless.

However, the efforts of this dude caught the attention of a lesser Youtuber named bredaniel (now under the alias of Disneydaniel93). He too, decided to make his own crossovers, but with almost little effort whatsover. Like [[DisneyFan01]], his characters do not contribute to or change the flow of the original plot. However, at least DisneyFan01's [[Mary Sue]] was actually ''involved'' in the story, nonexistent as it might seem. bredaniel completely fails here. Pooh and his friends does very little "adventuring" and more standing around giving commentary, saying the [[obvious]], and stealing peoples lines.

As baffling as this seem, such behavior is oncommon in the vast world of the [[Internets]].

== The Pooh's Adventure Formula ==
[[File:Poohthumb1.jpg|thumb|left|Completely original, guys!]]
1. View any film/TV series/cuts-ER I mean, video game, regardless of the original demographic or theme. Perferably anything made by [[Disney]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[George Lucas]], Don Bluth, [[4Kids]], PBS, and any 'family' film made in the last 20-30 years.  

2. Put them through the fantastic program known as [[Windows Movie Maker]].

3. In about 10 minutes, hapzardley place clips of Pooh, Spongebob, The Lion King, hell, anything! 
[[File:Poohthumb2.jpg|thumb|left|Nope, no infringement at all!]]
4. Sentence mixing? Bah! Who needs that shit when you can add subtitles and make it sound like they aren't lazy asses.

5. Don't do, you know, anything cool with the movie. Keep the movie as it orginally was, making sure "guests" only give commentary.

6. Dont grammar chek! Make videos very fast! The fans are very impatent and demand pooh and frinds now!

7. ???

8. PROFIT!!!

==How to Troll==
* One thing you can do is make your own crossover/parody, but use some adult movie/TV show that they have never seen

</center> You'll know its them when they thumb them down!
* Ask them if they can do any crossovers with R-Rated movies.
* Suggest they watch some [[MST3K]] episodes and tell them this is how it's done without sucking.
