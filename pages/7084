'''[http://www.rottentomatoes.com Rotten Tomatoes]''' worthless tool for finding out if the your average [[pedophile|filmophile]] thinks a [[movie]] [[suck]]s or not. This is determined by [[%]]s:

*90% or higher: Currently being [[trolled]] by fans (i.e. [[Twilight]]). Rating off by 200%.
*75% or higher: Average amount of [[trolls]] under this [[bridge]]. Rating off by 75%.
*45%-74% range: Irradiated desert where a few unbiased reviews roam the wasteland. 
*25%-45% range: Where the [[fail|true cinematic gems]] are hiding.
*Below 25%: Face it, even the diehard trolls don't like these. 

On the site, there are the ratings of the super [[leet]] approved "T-meter critics" and the ratings of the [[Aspergers|"RT community"]]. These two ratings can differ from times to times.

In short, any [[scene|douchebag]] with a domain name and enough site views can make a movie sound good. This site cannot be trusted as it gave ''[[Brokeback Mountain|Bareback Mountain]]'' an 84%, [[awesome|Paranormal Activity]] an 83% and ''[[Dyke|Million Dollar Baby]]'' a 91%. For some reason, it has ''[[Pixar|Toy Story 2]]'' ranked higher than ''[[Mafia|The Godfather]]'' in the top movies section, despite ''The Godfather'' having [[fail|a higher user rating and a higher average score]].

==Government==

This site is [[admin|run by]] nerd-hating [[Jews]].  The Jews pick a random number for a movie and let the nerds [[fuck|kill]] each other debating said score.  They are similar to the [[wtf|manatees]] that run Family Guy since they pick shit at random, but differ in that [[Jews_did_wtc|they want money]].
