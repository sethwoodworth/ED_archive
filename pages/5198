'''Markorepairs''' is an unemployed [[basement-dweller]] from [[Finland]], who has posted [[over 9000]] videos on the [[Jewtube]]s, but only a few that aren't in [[Moonspeak]], thus frustrating the hundreds of people on [[Gizmodo]] [http://gizmodo.com/5664821/one-mans-vcr-player-collection-earns-my-best-video-of-the-month-badge who creamed themselves over the epic soundtrack and advanced special effects] featured in his ''magnum opus'', 'My VCR collection VHS recorder'. This epic features his frankly [[Aspergers|insane]] collection of VHS VCR recorder, but he has lost his remoter controlla, so he can't work any of them.

Similar to [[Ulillillia]], Markorepairs is a unique flower who is perhaps best left untrolled; he seems perfectly capable of producing a near infinite amount of [[lulz]] without [[troll|interference]] from anyone else.
==Marko's other interests==
Besides accumulating obsolete technologies in his basement, Marko's other interests include [[rap]] music, being a keen [[internet police|anti-tobacco activist]], [[coffee]], being completely [[batshit crazy]], [[homeless|making dinner from the trash]], and [[LOL|laughing in a scary, insane manner]].

==Tributes==
Some [[basement-dweller|people]] regard Marko as a hero, and have recorded tributes to his insanity.
