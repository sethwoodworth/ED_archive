Lucas Caparelli is a [[jock]] who is notable for [[fail|failing]] at [[facebook]] resulting in his own [[ruination|self-ruin]] and for not having the balls to be [[Cho Seung-Hui]].

==The Drama==

Lucas was a [[football]] player at Wake Forest who was sitting in his father's girlfriend's [[basement dweller|basement]] when like most other jocks, he decided to log on to [[facebook]]. It was the day before he was supposed to return to school for the spring semester, and due to the fact that the Wake Forest students are [[rich and beautiful]] and he was [[poor|not]] and because he was confused by their [[buttsecks|elaborate rituals]] and [[fellatio|traditions]], he felt that he needed to [[Yngwie Malmsteen|unleash the fucking fury]].

He changed his status on [[facebook]] so that it gave the following message for him: 

{{quote|Lucas Caparelli recommends not going to class on Wednesday because he is going to blow up campus. For those left standing he will have an uzi locked and loaded in his bag.}}

Lucas left this ever so credible threat "to blow up campus" on his profile for a whopping 90 minutes before taking it down. However, 90 minutes was long enough to incite a complete [[lollercaust]] as it was plenty enough time for another Wake Forest student to say "OMG [[Virginia Tech Massacre|VTECH]]!!1!1" and report this threat to the irl [[police]].

==The Reaction==

Hilariously, Lucas assisted the [[partyvan]] in apprehending him by [[retard|locking himself out of his own campus apartment and approaching the police for help]] shortly after his arrival back on campus and he was promptly placed under arrest for [[Internet Law|crimes against facebook]]. Lucas was grossly unaware that [[The Internet is serious business|the internet is serious fucking business]] as this quote he gave to the Washington Post shows:

{{quote|"At the time, I didn't think I was going to get in trouble for anything. I know what he's talking about. It's easy. I'm going to explain myself."|Lucas Caparelli}}

However, Forsyth County District Attorney Tom Keith decided he was going to teach the lad just how fucking serious the internet is and is currently considering prosecuting him so that young Lucas can be sentenced to [[butthurt|two years for trolling]]. Caparelli was given the [[banhammer]] by Wake Forest despite being on their [[football]] team and will have to reapply there to go back.

The truly [[irony|ironic]] part of the incident is that Caparelli grew up mere miles from [[Cho Seung-Hui]].

==His [[facebook]] page==
Not content with failing at facebook, Lucas explained his threats partly by his [[wigger|love of rap]]. An admitted [[fanboi]] of Eminem, Lucas used his own rap skillz to pen this catchy number about his hatred of his school on the same day he threatened to blow up campus: 

{{quote|"tomorrow I return to the hell known as wake, scares me so much that in my boots I'm starting to shake, can't find no good, a place with no pleasure, getting stabbed in the face is about the fun you can measure, surrounded by arrogant, rich, spoiled little brats, didn't earn a [expletive] thing, everything was laid in their laps, these cocky bastards are spreading like a cancer, not infecting me though because maybe I'll transfer"}}

In his other comments, Lucas admits to rampant [[faggotry]] by inviting the entire campus to suck his [[cock]]. It is a virtual certitude that he wrote his threat partly because nobody took up his offer. Unfortunately, he has also since made his facebook profile [[friends only]].
