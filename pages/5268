Media Slayer Productions
[[File:MediaSlayerLogo1.jpg|thumb|right|400px|We're edgy]]

'''Media Slayer Productions''' was founded in March 2010, with only two members with two blogs. Sense then this website has been the subject of horrible editing and useless additions of content that no one cares to watch. Media Slayer first got its start from the [http://www.thatguywiththeglasses.com That Guy With The Glasses] website, when a couple of blog posters got together and decided to farm the community of worthless talent and begin a site, stealing content off of the Nostalgia Critic website.[[File:Killingpuppies.JPG |thumb| The Man Who Started Media Slayer]]

== The Site ==

The content on Media Slayer consists of mostly stupid blogs and pointless rants and raves from shitty reviewer personalities. While there is always some potentially good articles and videos found on Media Slayer, its horrible layout system makes it impossible to show anything worthy of seeing. Viewers are often overwhelmed by the huge volume of choices posted on the websites main page.

After many attempts at re-designing the main page, it was finally settled and turned into a shitty [[Google Sites]] webpage.

== Members ==

Currently there appears to be about 12 or 13 members of Media Slayer who do various updates on the website during breaks from watching porn. The Founder is "The Media Slayer" who has only one video posted. His lack of personal content and proper layout of the site suggests that he is in it for the money and not for the sake of trying to produce anything worthwhile.

'''Current Members:'''

''Music Freak'' - a boring nerd who has a really shitty video show where he tries to make fun of how shitty popular musicians are. Also, he probably has no girlfriend.<br>
''The Media Slayer(owner)'' - is a self loathing, hateful, puppy killing bastard who knows nothing about being funny or how to run a good website.<br>
''That BDSM Girl'' - some girl who likes to get beaten.<br>
''Chris The Mad Scientist'' - some crazy guy who spends way to much time in the basement listening to metal.<br>

''Jashykins''-a person so bad at making videos that they couldn't match the site's standards. Now is forced to write blogs to stay on the site.
