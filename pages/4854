'''Limewire''' (also '''Lamewire''', '''Limevirus''' or '''Viruswire''') [[copyright infringement|was]] a P2P [[virus]] sharing program that tricks people into trying to use it to download [[music]] and [[porn|videos]]. For [[pedos]] everywhere it is a hotspot to download [[cp]] and [[loli]].  If you type in one word, your search list will fill up with tacky home made porn videos because apart from [[virus]]es, that is all Limewire really is.  So strap yourself in, you're goin' for a crazy ride!...until Lamewire gives you spyware and you lose all your music.  Was it really that hard to pay out the $6.99 for that [[My Chemical Romance|crappy]] music?  Also note, do not search for the band Cream, you won't find what you're looking for.  Also, don't bother trying to download a full movie, 10 minutes into downloading what you thought was the first Pokemon movie because you're too lazy to drag out your VHS copy, you will click "preview download" only to find out that instead of Pikachu's Summer Vacation, you've been downloading some bitch sucking off some fat dude on his personal yacht while she moans about how good his balls feel slapping her ass while he fucks her tight pussy.  Enjoy your wrong download and your Spyware, asshole.

On a positive note its is good for getting some sweet [[CP]] when the [[4chan]] mods are actively [[404]]ing all the cp threads. Just remember to remove it from the public shared folder or the  [[party van]] could get you.

== Limewire Pro ==
Limewire Pro was nothing but Limewire with a few extra additions that do [[in beta|absolutely nothing to make the program any better]]. They try to make you pay for the upgrade, but you can get it for free simply by [http://rapidshare.com/files/213545371/LimeWirePro5.1.2.zip clicking here]. [[Idiot]]s. The only people dumber than those who thought of Limewire Pro are the [[luser]]s who pay for it. Seriously though, why would anybody at all pay for it when you can download it for free using the free version of lime wire? Seriously. I am not kidding. Just search limewire pro with the search engine built into limewire. Like [[WTF]]?!?!? Are they that stupid

== Limewire Pirate Edition ==
RIAA just got pwnd. Less than a month after its "permanent shut down," LimeWire has been resurrected by an anonymous dev team--and it's better and more powerful than before. Or, well, something like that.
