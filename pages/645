[[Image:Hacker_Rick_FAILFAG.jpg|thumb|right|Fat emo failfag.]]
In a [[desperate]] attempt to gain [[Internet celebrity|notoriety]], [[Buttsecks|sexual favors]], and [[Money|cash]], 21 year-old '''Ashley Towns''' (AKA Ikee), an [[Basement Dweller|unemployed web design loser]], grabbed the three day old and freshly released source code for a relatively harmless [[Shit|iPhone]] [[Rape|exploit]], changed one line of the code and claimed it as his own.  Since it was a slow news day, and because [[old media]] rags are not known for embracing such techniques as “fact checking,” “[[Sauce|sourcing]],” or “actually looking things up” the [[United States of Australia|Australian]] press [[Fellatio|gobbled]] up the story and quickly went to press with it, doubtlessly out of a [[White Knighting|noble]] urge to expose the “[[4chan|dark underbelly of the internet]]” and to out yet another “[[HACKERS ON STEROIDS|hacker on steroids]]” for the good of all mankind.  On top of that, Towns, in one of the brighter moves ever perpetrated, [[Retard|cleverly]] hid his own name within the malicious code, because the Internet’s worm writing community isn’t a seedy and jealous lot, and because nobody would be the wiser…right?

== Background ==
[[Image:Hacker Rick Astley.jpg|thumb|right|More fat emo failfag.]]
Ashley Towns is a [[fat]] [[scene]] [[fag]] who wrote the first true [[virus|worm]] for the [[Apple]] iPhone[http://www.itnews.com.au/News/160078,jailbroken-iphones-fall-victim-to-australian-virus.aspx]. The worm exploits retards who jail break their iPhones but don't change the default password (alpine). The [[internet hate machine]] was told he merely stole the Dutch version of code released on all the usual networks and changed the [[Semen|payload]] to load a [[old meme|Rick Astley]] wallpaper. However this can be easily disproved by looking at the removal methods for the ikee worms (written in C), and the [[script kiddie|dutch scripts]] (.plist). Dutch script kiddie PureInfinity92 previously exploited the same default password hack but his script was considered unworthy of worm status. Anon however took one look at Ikees [[piercing|mutilated]] scene faggot head and questions about [[fact|facts]] like, what networks, and where is the dutch code were forgotten. 

Ikee foolishly tried to obtain some efame from his worm but instead got the usual hate machine [[Internet stalking|stalking]] treatment including spamming him with [[hate mail]] and death threats, narking to the [[pigs]], and attacking his [[Incest|family]]. A hate site was quickly built and an [[Anonymous|Anon]] [[X is not your personal army|personal army]] was formed by one [[racist|Andrew Sanders]]. Mr Sanders personal army [[retards|recruits]] following their great leader created this page.

Ashley Towns enjoys [[Yaoi|tea]], [[gay|long walks on the beach]], and candle-lit dinners. He offsets his [[fail]]ure at life by rendering [[noob|uneducated twats]] on IRC servers in awe of his [[l33t]] hacking skills.  He is now living in [[Poor|squalor]] with his [[Whore|mother]] in Wollongong, [[Australia]], after being [[Banhammer|kicked out]] of his old place for being too [[fat]]. 

While he [[Fail|hasn't]] been able to successfully hold down a job, he is single and looking (HELLO LADIES) but has issues with [[Erectile dysfunction|sealing the deal]] with girlfriends, who tend to dump him in record time.  He's a jobless twenty-something who runs his own [[web design]] firm (see: [[loser|unemployed]]).
When he isn't approaching news outlets trying to claim ownership of the LOLOLFIRSTIPHONEWORM!1!!1!~eleven! he can be found being [[fat]], piercing his face shut because he's so [[Emo|scene]], or playing [[WoW]] while being fat.

[[Image:Smearcampaign.jpg|thumb|right|It's all just a 4chan smear campaign guise!]]
[[Image:Epicpwn.jpg|thumb|left|[[moralfag|Anon]] strikes back, found on 4chan.]] UPDATE: It appears [[internet hate machine|anons on 4chan and 888chan]] are livid about this putz claiming to have [[Al Gore|invented the internets]], uh, I mean the first Apple iPhone worm and have decided to get the bitch [[v&]].

After [[attention whoring|running to the media]] claiming he wrote the worm rather than plagiarized it, he was caught [[Liar|lying]] when he admitted he's only '[[noob|just learning]] C' and that he required help in his first interview. He left his [[dox|real name]] in the source and leaked it to the press to try and garner more attention, then promptly fell out of favor once they [[ugly|got a look at him]]. Ages after it hitting the chans, Andrew Sanders of infamy [http://slackbastard.anarchobase.com/?p=1259 here] created [[fags|Halcon]] a page dedicated to trolling Ikee which [[pwn|pwned him]] in the media and released the Ikee dox which were uncovered by /b/ stalkers.

==Replicating his leetness==
*ssh root@IP "rm -rf /"
*enter "alpine" as password

==Mogeneration==
Apparently, the friendly folks over at the [[Lame|iPhone application development company]] Mogeneration have some difficulty using Google: even though this informal page is the ninth result for the simple query of just his name, they offered him a job which he accepted.

|On examination of the code leaked, side by side with the Dutch worm, it appears identical in functionality and syntax.|Anonymous, Daily Telegraph

|What's wrong with the [[Cops|police]] in Australia? Can't they arrest a self confessed criminal? What good are they?|Anonymous, 4chan.

|The real question is: What comes first, the search warrant or the hard drive format?|Anonymous, 4chan (in reply to above)

|The motivation behind claiming another hackers virus as his own is clearly based on monetary gain, the individual appears to run a web design firm from his bedroom at his mothers house in suburban Dapto, and has yet to file a tax return of any profit from that ABN. With no education, or regular employment, it appears Ashley’s attention stunt is driven for pecuniary gain through attention driven through the media.|Halcon expresses their disappoint.
