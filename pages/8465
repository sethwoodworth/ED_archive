Specializing in fucking things up, misspeaking and generally causing problems and huge embarrassment for $cientology,  
'''Tommy Davis''', born Ibrahim Goldberg (aka [[Footbullet Man]]), is the son of Anne Archer and a member of the elite [[Scientology]] [[liar|"Press Team"]] from the [[OSA|Office of Special Affairs]].  It is believed that Tommy contributes more to the discrediting and destruction of $cientology than anyone in [[Chanology]] or [[Anonymous]] ever could. It is rumored that $cientology is seeking compensation from the manufacturers of the downlink auto vocalization bus fitted to Tommy, which displayed several runtime errors during his last reanimation, causing what the organization called 'A PR Flap.' A spokesman for Cyberdyne Systems, designers of the bus, has said that the glitches in the Davis unit came from his organic components, rather than the implant.

In the past Tommy has brought the world such classics as '''BBC Panorama: $cientology and me''' in which he proclaimed his love of children and cats (but not [[mudkips]]).  Once Tommy was done fucking up with the handling of the BBC, OSA boss '''Mike Rinder''' fled the country (and later the cult) as the impact the shit-storm Tommy unleashed on $cientology was so great.

For the last several months Tommy has been a resident of $cientology's RPF, a gay mens' bathhouse and spa for the rehabilitation of sexual libidos towards [[shota|young boys]] and men. [[Last Thursday|Recently]], Tommy was sprung from the [[jail|RPF]] to handle [[Anonymous]] and [[Chanology]], [[David Miscavige]] should really have known that all he should expect was epic fail so great that Tommy would put onto [[The_Geterator|motivational]] posters and attempted to be forced as a meme by [[moralfags]] within two hours of the interview airing, as [[enturbulation]] users decided that they finally had a reason to leave their [[hugbox]] forum and /b/oldy /b/ound into the /b/ordello that is [[b|/b/]].

Rather [[LOL WUT|surprisingly]], the reaction of this [[rape|influx]] was not greeted with the usual protests of [[GTFO]] from [[b|/b/tards]].  The wealth of amusing potential shoops of Tommy and general hilarity at his epic level of fail, combined with CNN Presenter John Roberts's insistence that Tommy [[STFU]] about [[Rorschach|imaginary threats]] and [[lulz|start talking about the involvement of parasitic aliens in the cult's doctrine]], meant that little Tommy of OSA has achieved the seemingly impossible task of [[buttsecks|uniting]] the [[SFB|warring factions]] of [[Anonymous]] days before [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY/OPERATION_FAIRGAME:STOP|the May Protest]].  '''THX MR DAVIS!!!!'''

* Tommy will never be there at the start of the interviews.
* Tommy's [[gaydar|e-meter]] reading is [[9000|off the charts]].
* Tommy's current location is unknown, but it's probably on the receiving end of a [[David Miscavige|Midget Fist Enema]].
* Whilst [[Anonymous]] laughed at the latest PR fail, the [http://www.villagevoice.com ''Village Voice''] actually did [[fail|something productive]] and <s>wrote a serious article critiquing his performance on CNN</s> made [http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2008/05/scientology_spo.php fun of him and Scientology in General]

{{quote|Davis gives the game away when Roberts asks him to give a basic description of what Scientologists do believe, and Davis can’t do it. Maybe because this doesn’t play well on national TV:<br>

Superhuman powers! The ability to leave your body! To shape space and time with your mind! To be impervious to disease and live forever! And all for only a mere $100,000 in cash, several years of your life, separation from your family and friends, and complete dedication to a dead pulp-fiction writer who dreamed up a religion starring disembodied alien souls being carried through the galaxy on spacecraft shaped like DC-3s!

== Tommy's Fail : A Great Service to Chanology==

'''CNN Interview : May 7th 2008'''

Tommy appeared on CNN with John Roberts an interviewer who will take NO SHIT from anyone, especially some faggot who believes in [[Xenu|Alien Genocide]].  

* Below you can watch Tommy in action, doing what he does best - imitating the keystone cops of Public Relations.

If I were a pathologist, I'd speculate that a [[David Miscarriage|very angry infant spider monkey]] had gotten a piece of Mr. Davis.

==UPDATELINE: Anonymous==

Tommy yet again delivered powerful lulz; perhaps even greater than his CNN dipshittery.  In an investigation done by KESQ-TV's [[baka|Nathan Baca]], Tommy was [[castration|presented]] with a laundry list of LRH insanity that Scilons are programmed to [[divide_by_zero|read as null]] until they [[windows|pay for software upgrades.]]  Confronted by [[Space_Opera|Hubbards' space madness]], the [[Delete_fucking_everything|freewheel pneumonia killswitch]] and [[pwnd|razor-spiked U-R-MY-NIGGER fences]] Tommy kept his cool, and then he fucked the duck.  Starting off he admitted scifags pedal propaganda.  He shortly thereafter expressed his love for the RPF by [[IDIFTL|Confirming the existence of Xenu]] he then [[retarded|pointed out]] that spikes face toward the compound just because [[O_RLY|they were installed that way.]] Finally he went "[[Xenu]]? [[NO_U]]." and proceeded to empty an AK-47 clip into his L.A. gears.

At 1:49, when the reporter [[Win|reads a copy of OTIII to Tommy]], he then tells the reporter [[epic win|that he's "familiar with the material."]]

==Tommy does Nightline==

With Xenu and Scifags now the hippest trend; Tommy now had the honor of having his ass handed to him by a [[old media|National News TV anchor.]]  Gave some lulz, and promptly [[ragequit|pussied out.]]

==Tommy's Tattoo==
[[Image:Sea org.png|right]]

Recently Dallas, the husband of Jenna Miscavige decided that as '''"Tommy has taken it on himself to work on <br> destroying my family behind my back, yet refuses to confront or even talk to me or Jenna"''' - he thought that [http://www.exscientologykids.com/eskforums/viewtopic.php?t=1033 he would troll him] via [http://www.exscientologykids.com ESK], by telling the [[internet]] about Tommy's [[gay|sailor's tattoo]].

{{quote|Tommy did not have just any tattoo, he had the Sea Org symbol on his bicep. He was dedicated to this group. Back then I thought that was the most brilliant tattoo as you weren't going to get tired of that on your arm, hell it would still be appropriate in a Billion years.  <br> Now since Tommy was the Senior Vice-Pres CCI at the time he went everywhere celebs were, every Maiden Voyage and he and Susan (Pres CCI) were there. Well the story goes from James, and confirmed by Tommy; one day Tommy was up with his shirt off on the Sun deck of the Freewinds and [[David Miscarriage|Dave]] is doing his rounds with the public and he sees Tommy there with this new tattoo. Let's just say he was not too happy with little Tommy and asked him, "Did you get IA (Issue Authority) for that?" See Tommy forgot that symbol was trademarked by RTC, oops!<br><br>Well the next few months Tommy was on the cans with RTC for that little mistake and up came a few others|<big>'''CoS being anal about [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY/LEAKED DOX|copyright]]'''</big>}}
