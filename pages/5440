Misterpoet is a regular poster at Sparknotes' Your Poetry message boards. His poetry, usually lacking any creativity, logic, or any semblance to modern English, used to be mocked mercilessly, and his comments sparked some of the best [[drama]] of all time. His Sparknotes profile says his IQ is 72, two points away from being legally [[retard|retarded]]

===Examples of Poetry===

   Death, she is of beauty  
   to my eyes,  
   She calls my name  
   with peace tonight,  
   And I follow her  
   into the light  
   Where everything is clam  
   and peaceful and quiet.  
   Nothing more is around  
   but me and death  
   holding hands.  
   We walk together  
   down the hall  
   into eternity--  
   a room painted sky  
   with roses and a waterfall.  
   Then she drifts off  
   and I'm alone in my twilight,  
   though not afraid  
   of this lonliness...  
   Every-so-often, she returns  
   and we speak of harmony  
   and I smile, full of joy and glee.  
   I can't believe it took so long  
   for her to come and take me.

===The Best of His Drama===
====Comments to Critique====
When someone disagrees with Misterpoet's creative vision and challenges the merit of his "work", Misterpoet gets very upset. Taken from the same thread as the above poem:

:"YOU ARE PISSING ME OFF SAYING I FORCED THE GODDAMN RHYME... I DIDN'T. 
:AND SECOND OFF: I LIKE EMILY DICKINSON! WHO GIVES A FUCK IF YOU THINK SHE SUCKS... 
:I HATE FUCKING PEOPLE SAYING I FORCE SHIT... I DON'T! 
:I have many idol's... Emily, Carl, Cummings, Longfellow, Whitman... and more [http://mb.sparknotes.com/mb.epl?r=1&b=128&m=1007178&t=292403 here]

===="Poet of the Year"====
Once Misterpoet contributed to a scam poetry contest, where everyone contributing a poem gets his or her poem in an anthology with a message saying they are "Poet of the Year!!" Excited, he told everyone at Your Poetry he was "POET OF THE YEAR (BIG ANNOUNCEMENT!!)" His dreams were crushed by the sentimental audience.

====Homosexuality====
Misterpoet claims to be gay [http://mb.sparknotes.com/mb.epl?b=128&m=507698&h=gay,misterpoet here], yet also claimed he had a son and girlfriend, and was engaged to his boyfriend [http://mb.sparknotes.com/mb.epl?b=128&m=1056717&h=kid,misterpoet the "shocker" here]. No one knows how he can lead so many lives at once, unless he is in fact bullshitting.

====ED Drama====
Misterpoet has recently blanked [[User:Misterpoet|his]] and various other [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=User:Thedreadedkettle&oldid=1996954028 ED Userpages] and has threatened ED and [[User:Transmitfailure|TransmitFailure]] with legal action. However, instead, Misterpoet missed his e-court date and instead blanked the page. All e-charges were dropped, and thus, the page stays.

====For the love of Garwy====
As Misterpoet's court date approached and the extent of the charges became known, [[Garwy]] (who Misterpoet had always adored, no matter how much Garwy sneered at him) suddenly decided Misterpoet's 'poems' were now wonderful, and they had email correspondence, no doubt in an attempt to expand their [[pedo]] ring on Sparknotes.
