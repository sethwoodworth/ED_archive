'''''Prototype''''' (stylized as '''''[PROTOTYPE]''&trade;''' because the developers think they're [[cool]]) is an action-adventure video game released on the [[XBox 360]], [[PS3]] and [[PC]], with the [[Wii]] once again being left out because its hardware sux. It was released to generally positive reviews, despite being hyped to ''[[Contra]]'' status like ''[[Assassin's Creed]]''. Upon release it was the number one selling game of that month (not including [[Shit|''Wii Sports'', ''Wii Play'', or ''Wii Fit'']] because they suck horrible donkey dick, like [[User:VandalFucker|VandalFucker]]). 

__TOC__

==Characters==
===Alex Mercer===
[[Image:Alex34.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Cumdumpster|Fangirl]] wet dream.]]
A [[guido]] with a perpetually placed [[Emo|hoodie]], who has no recollection of past events and no idea where he is. He wakes up in a morgue in the building of "GENTEK" and discovers he has the ability to shapeshift. Not only that but he [[OM NOM NOM|can eat people to gain their appearance, skills and memories]]. After a minor altercation with a bunch of soldiers, he sets off to [[Vore|consume]] those who are linked to the company to find out what has happened. At the end of the game you find out through the [[Shit nobody cares about|Web of Intrigue]] that Alex Mercer actually died after he released the virus by smashing it onto the ground before he was shot by the internet police. The virus took over Alex's corpse and Alex was fighting himself the whole time lol.

Alex Mercer is also increasingly becoming a character that many fangirls want to be ripped apart and sodomized by.

===Elizabeth Greene===
[[Image:ElizabethGreeneAIDS.jpg|right|thumb|120px|I'd hit it.]]
[[Image:GreeneAlexHawt.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Unintentional fap material.]]
An aids carrying crackwhore with a bad case of herpes all over her face from all the soldier dick she had to suck for cigarettes. But other than that, she's the naturally infected black person virus who was held captive by Blackwatch after they kidnapped and apparently killed her baby, later known as Jew. So anyway, she is given the codename MOTHER, and is Alex's equal on the natural viral level as Alex is the artificial virus. Or some shit like that. Alex kills her.

===Pariah===
Elizabeth Greene's son, called the ultimate life organism, and would be Alex's opposite as  the ultimate virus, but in this case natural. The game contains a lot of [[Hellsing|dead babies]]. He'll most likely be the main villain in the second game.

===Dana Mercer===
Alex's [[dyke]] sister who he uses to get information and then almost gets killed. She doesn't know her actual brother is dead, but at least now she can [[incest|fuck]] this one, amirite?

===Karen Parker===
Alex's fucking sellout cumdumpster whore of an ex-girlfriend who gave Alex over to Blackwatch, but then Alex [[LOL|kills her in the elevator]].

===Captain Cross===
Fuckin' [[gangsta]] super soldier who works for Blackwatch and is the first 'boss' fight in the game, and he takes away Alex's powers by [[rape|penetrating]] him with a [[penis|long, hard steel needle]]. He feels empathy for Alex even though he must do his job, but he is killed by the Supreme Hunter, who takes his form and punks Alex into working with him.

===Director McMullen===
[[All caps|The FAGGOT WHO STARTED THIS SHIT]]!!!1!

===Dr. Bradley Ragland===
The token black person. Helps Alex when he looses his powers and then helps Dana when Alex rescues her. But Alex was too fucking stupid to not question why Ragland knew so fucking much, and like always was a prick and didn't even thank Ragland for helping him.

===Supreme Hunter===
The last boss of the game, who took Captain Cross' form after he consumed him and [[Noob|got Alex to work for him]]. Supreme Hunter was born when Elizabeth Greene was attacked by Alex and injected with that bloodtox shit and to defend herself she spewed a giant fetus from her throat who Alex beat up until he got some on his shoe, and for some reason that got him to regenerate. *shrug*

<b>TL;DR: YOU ARE THE VIRUS</b>

You control an amnesiac named Alex Mercer who has no recollection of past events and no idea where he is. He wakes up [[naked]] in a [[basement dweller|basement of a company]] called 'GENTEK' with a [[butthurt|throbbing pain in his ass]] and discovers he has the ability to shapeshift. Not only that but he [[OM NOM NOM|can eat people to gain their appearance, skills and memories]]. After a minor altercation with a bunch of soldiers, he sets off to consume those who are linked to the company to find out what has happened.

Once Alex gets out to [[New York|Manhatten]] he finds that the whole city is in disarray. The army is hunting down people who may have a similar disease to him. A black operation group known as '[[KKK|Blackwatch]]' are attempting to rid [[niggers]] who have caught the disease from the city. As Alex traverses through the city he must fight his way through the [[army]], Blackwatch, a bunch of [[Azn|infected humans]] and a pack off extremely feral [[dog]]s known as 'hunters', who look like the result of a [[Dead Space|necromorph]] and [[Star Fox]] orgy. 

So Alex infiltrates GENTEK with the help of his sister, and finds an infected [[MILF]] named Elizabeth Greene who is being quarantined by GENTEK. She escapes the building and becomes the leader of the hunters. Alex makes contact with his ex-girlfriend Karen, who turns out to be a secret Blackwatch employee. She leads him to an officer of Blackwatch whose name is [[Master Chief|Captain King]], where he gets injected with a 'cure' that slowly destroys his powers. If that wasn't a big enough kick in the [[ball]]s for poor Alex, his sister got kindapped too. A guy named Doctor Ragland eventually makes a counter-cure for Alex witch restores his power back, and a [[AIDS|biological weapon]] to kill Elizabeth Green. He injects the weapon into Greene, where she vomits out a mixture of [[semen]] and [[blood]] which transforms into the 'Supreme Hunter'. Alex kills the Supreme Hunter and takes his sister to a safe hiding place.

As the story unfolds with the help of a mysterious contact, Alex finds out that in 1969 the [[government]] created the virus that was designed , I shit you not, to specifically target and kill black person (srsly.). It was tested on the [[niggers]] in Idaho, but unfortunatly, the virus decided not to be racist and instead fucked up everyone. When it got out of hand, the government decided to [[nuke]] the fuck out of Idaho, with Elizabeth Greene being the only survivor, and who was infected with the virus. He also learns about his own past. After someone leaked the GENTEK project, it was shut down and all employees were to [[holocaust|be eliminated]] from life. Blackwatch soldiers proceeded to [[perma-ban]] all who worked on the GENTEK project, which includes Alex. Knowing he couldn't possibly escape, Alex took a tube filled with the virus and unleashed it. The soldiers then shot Alex down. The virus however [[swine flu|spread across the city]] and reanimated a clone of Alex's corpse. That's right, it turns out you're a fucking reanimated virus and its your fault the entire city has gone to shit!

So basically Alex fishes out Elizabeth from the underground with an anti-virus, whose real name is MOTHER, and kills her. Then the secret contact wants Alex to kill the guy who was in charge of all the GENTEK research whose name is <s>McMullen</s> McLovin. When Alex reaches him he [[an hero]]es. After he dies, it is revealed that the leader of Blackwatch, General Randall, wants to [[Shoop da whoop|nuke Manhatten out of the fucking stratoshpere]] to get rid of the virus. The contact, who turns out to be Captain King, tells Alex to board a ship named '[[Ronald Reagan]]' where the nuke is being held. Alex kills the leader of the army, Colonel Taggart as well as General Randall. Captain King then reveals himself to be the Supreme Hunter you thought you killed earlier on. He transforms into his [[final form]] and fight Alex to the death. Alex becomes a [[winner]] after decapitating Captain King and submerges the nuke into the water. When he attempts to return back to land, the nuke explodes and takes him with it. After his fucked up body floats back to land he eats a crow and regenerates back to normal, ending [[the game]] (which you just lost by the way).

==Gameplay==

[[Image:Prototype godhand.png|thumb|left|[[Godhand Edit|Godhand]] edition.]]

[[Image:Guro Gay Dogs.jpg|thumb|[[Typical]] ''Prototype'' scene.]]

{{quote|It was amusing using some of the powers, however that sweet taste quickly turned to a used kitty-litter box in my mouth as I realized I was facing the same. old. enemies. over. and. over. again.|[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/prototype Metacritic]}}
The gameplay in ''Prototype'' was designed to appeal to retarded [[13-year-old boy|13-year-olds]]. You get to make weapons out of your arms (like that guy from [[The Governator|''Terminator 2'']]) and can [[Guro|stab, slash, decapitate, and rip apart your opponents]]. You are able to [[identity theft]] someone by killing them and eating the rotting corpse, prompting you to assume their appearance. If you take damage, you can heal by eating a hunter's [[shit]], also known as "Biomass".

Players have the ability to [[Jackie Chan|scale buildings]], jump unrealistic distances, fly through the air, and can run faster then an [[Olympics|Olympic]] black person on [[steroids]]. Paying homage to the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, players can also jack a [[motherfucker]] if they see fit. Players can take control of army tanks and helicopters and use them to destroy shit. Players also have the ability to turn into a flying cannonball and blast their opponents away, as well as using dead bodies as skateboards as a means of transport. Players can also freely roam the city and go on rampages, fucking up innocent civilians at any time they please, and destroy vehicles. Move aside ''GTA'', [[lawyers]], [[Christfag|fundamentalist Christians]] and [[concerned mother]]s have a new target.

[[TL;DR]]: [[Fail|Prototype]] is every [[Retard|ADHD]] gamers wet dream.

However..If you can somehow fumble your way to the end of the game, AND you still don't think you got your money's woth upon buying this piece of [[shit]], You're given two options:

Restart the entire game after have just beaten it. But this time, you get to keep anything and everything you unlocked in the first run. meaning that it will be a complete push-over and you'll probably have it finished within the [[Nerd|hour]].

Or, [[Shit nobody cares about|Roam the streets of NY, cleaning up all the remaining enemy bases and hives, engaging in "Time Based" Mini-games]], Collecting [[Over 9000]] shiny little [[balls]], Unlock [[moar]] power-ups and stat boosters, and basically just do everything you already did, over and over. In the Gaming world. this is called: [[Lolwut|Replay Value]]

==[[Shit nobody cares about|Mutations]](TL;DR)==

'''[[Wolverine|Claws]]''' - The default mutation and starting weapon. Requires several [[over 9000|billion]] "Evolution Points" before [[Metal|Groundspike]] becomes a viable attack. You will use it twice, upgrade, and never look back.

'''[[Fap|Hammerfist]]''' - Alex forces his biomass into forming concentrated balls of hardened [[shit]] on the end of his arms, then attempts to direct them into the nearest expensive military weapon-thing.You can hurl yourself across entire buildings, beating the shit out of anyone in your way with your mighty [[Banhammer]] fists. Despite being the "anti armor" mutation of the game, you'll have a better chance at drawing a straight line with your own [[dick]] than actually hitting anything with this sluggish attack. Avoid.

'''[[BDSM|Whipfist]]''' - [[The game]]'s most notorious move. Allows Alex the ability to fling his rather large [[penis|phallus]] at people and [[lulz|rip their bodies in half]]. This weapon is your single [[hope]] in hell when the [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|Strike Teams]] arrive. Enables you to reel in people, smaller infected, and pieces of rubble for consumption or use as a projectile. You can also latch onto the helicopters, kill the crew, and [[Niggerjack|Skyjack]] the poor motherfuckers, thus pleasing all the [[GTA]] fags that bought this game.

'''[[awesome|Blade]]''' - The only upgrade in the game that deals out enough damage to make it usable, whilst also being quick enough to avoid getting yourself blown to pieces by the sheer numbers of on-screen enemies coming your way. In the progression of the [[Prototype]] storyline, the power is given after you complete a section of the game in which your powers are removed and eventually regained, as if to [[Bullshit|reward]] you for not snapping the game disc in half in frustration.

'''[[Fail|Musclemass]]''' - Remember this in the trailer? Remember how you pissed yourself with joy at the thought of becoming a giant black person [[bodybuilder]] at the push of a button? No? Of course you didn't, because that's absolutely scatterbrained. Musclemass is the most [[retarded]] power in the game. It's basically just your normal shitty unarmed melee attacks, but now you do 2% [[moar]] damage and throw things about 5 yards further. 

'''[[Firewall|Shield]]''' - A large, black, webby black person forms in front of you, blocking ranged attacks for a limited period of time and allowing you to charge through crowds of people like a human snowplow. After taking a certain amount of damage, this potentially entertaining device shatters into slivers of black mess, requiring you to wait half an hour or so for it to regenerate. [[truth|It's about as fun as it sounds.]]

'''[[Hax|Armour]]''' You are covered in a thick layer of your own [[Jizz|sticky fluids]]. Your attack power is increased, and, obviously, you take less damage. What they don't tell you is that you can no longer dodge, jump, or glide, forcing you to take every attack thrown at you like a big bulls-eye is strapped to your face. You also look like a giant metal black person.

'''[[Aids|Infected Vision]]''' - Allows you to track and detect anyone carrying the deadly [[Aids|virus]], which is pretty much everyone anyway. [[Gay|For some reason, it detects tanks and helicopters, but not infected hives.]] Strange. Like a lot of things in this game. you use it in a single mission, then forget all about it. 

'''[[shit|Thermal Sight]]''' - If you've ever watched [[Chris Hansen|Predator]] you'll know all about this. [[lol wut?|Due to tanks and helicopters giving off no heat]], they basically appear invisible to you. What you can't see can't hurt you, right?


However, to make up for this [[crap|steampile]] of [[fail]], Alex also has a bunch of [[epic]] moves known as "[[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|devastators]]". These include the [[tentacle rape|"Tendril Barrage"]], where he launches several smaller [[penis|phalluses]] from his body that [[rape|impales]] everyone, [[vore|"Groundspike Graveyard"]], where he jumps in the air and smashes back into the ground causing a bunch of spikes to pop up from the ground, and [[shoop da whoop|"Critical Pain"]], where Alex fires a [[Dragon Ball Z|Kamehameha]] that blasts his enemies to [[Hell]]. Basically, you can mash any button and blood sprays everywhere.

==Versus ''Infamous''==
[[Image:Alex and Cole by ZeKarmiSama.jpg|thumb|150px|Pretty much.]]
Another [[crap|game]] similar to ''Prototype'' was released two weeks beforehand entitled '''''Infamous''''' exclusively for the [[PS3]]. Its similarities include [[Spiderman|scaling buildings]], [[Superman|possessing super powers]], and being set in a [[sandbox]]-style city. Sony [[fanboy]]s will constantly try to draw comparisons between the two in an attempt to make themselves feel better over the fact that they spent $600 USD on an expensive [[blu-ray]] player.

It's [[Not|interesting]] to note that those who play Infamous, play [[Guild Wars]], and use [[Mac]] computers. Because they are faggots. They, for some reason, seem entitled to hold up their [[shitty|precious]] Infamous like it was the Holy Grail handed to them by [[God]] Himself, looking down upon Prototype with [[hate]] and [[liberal|biased, whiny]] comments, acting like [[The Game]] is some exclusive for the 360 or something. However, they [[fail]] to count in that it's '''MULTIPLATFORM''', meaning they too can buy it if they fucking want. All in all, it's as if the PS3 fanboys had two cakes to eat, claiming that one tastes like shit just because everyone else can have a slice, and they have a [[shit|chocolate]] cake to eat all to themselves, the [[Cracker|spoiled assholes]].

<br /><br />
<center>{{morphquote|mqtest|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;
|Infamous is on the PS3 only meaning it has better graphics then Prototype. You can't deny the PS3 has better technology.|Sonyfag disregarding that Prototype plays on PS3 as well.}}</center>

==Violence==
As you can tell, this game is violent. Millions and millions of liters of pixelated blood will be [[ejaculate]]d from the bodies of others as you sever them apart. When the inevitable sequel arrives and ''Prototype'' becomes an established franchise, you can be guaranteed millions of 10 year olds whose moms were stupid enough to buy them the games will re-enact what they see. [[Lawsuit|Lolsuits]] will be filed one millionfold, and tragedies will ensue. It'll be the first [[Grand Theft Auto|GTA]] all over again.

Notify [[Jack Thompson]] [[for great justice]].

==The [[Boring|Great]] Challenge==
[[Image:Infamous.JPG||thumb|[[Faggot|Fabulous]]!]]
[[Image:Prototype.JPG|thumb|I'd hit it like the fist of an angry god.]]

A couple weeks and some days ago, a [[faggot|great troll]] named [[Yahtzee]] was comparing ''Prototype'' with the shitty ''Infamous'' and as a joke could only break his indecisiveness if the developers could make their character look good while wearing a bra. The devs thought he was [[Serious|serious]] so they actually made their characters in bras and poorly rendered [[boobies]].

Due to Yahtzee's bad taste in boobies, he gave the winning vote to the creators of ''Infamous'' after vigorously fapping to the picture.
