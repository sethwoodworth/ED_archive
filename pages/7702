On March 15, 2009, a [[hero|heroic]] winged mammal hitched a ride on the ''Discovery'' space shuttle and decided to go [[Star Trek|where no bat has gone before]]. Unfortunately, NASA was not equipped with tiny space suits, helmets and other equipment for their unexpected visitor, and he died some time after arriving in Earth's upper atmosphere. NEVAR FORGET. 

With that, the bat managed to accomplish more than anything your [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] ass could ever hope to, and became an [[Internets]] phenomenon complete with [[shoop]]s, [[JewTube]] tributes, and even [http://www.space-bat.com/ his own website].
