Emotes
{{pixpls}}

'''Emotes''' are words or phrases with asterisks around them, indicating that some sort of action is being performed. It is typically used on instant messaging clients and on [[IRC]], thus making it [[old meme]] by definition.

== *blinks* ==
''This is about the human function. To read about [[lolz]]ing people up with Blink [[HTML]] tags, see [[Blink]].''

Some people are so pitifully [[Internets]]-[[obsession|obsessed]] that they've almost completely lost the power of ''blink''. Occasionally they muster enough brain activity to blink just once, making them so excited that they have to announce it. In many cases this happens so frequently you wouldn't think it was all that exciting, but it's all these people have in their lives so it's best to humour them.<br/>If [[Terri Schiavo]] had been on [[IRC]] she'd probably have blinked. Well done Terri.

== *penis* ==
{{main|Penis}}
This emote, usually depicted as <==3, or sometimes 8==D, represents the ''[[testicles]]'' (indicated with a 3 or 8) and ''[[penis]]'' (closed-off, extended object with some [[notable]] girth) of a human [[male]]. Often used to invite oral sex, as in 'eat a <==3'. Not to be confused with [[heart|<3]], meaning 'I have an incredibly short, but pointy, penis'.<br/>Other depictions include "(_)_)===========D" and "UUIIIIIIIID", and can also be rendered as [[Ejaculating|squirting]] [[semen]]: (_)_)IIIIIIIIIID<nowiki>~~~~~~~o~~~oO~O~oOO~o OO</nowiki>

For [[masturbation]], one would scroll a repeating [[macro]] of the following in a [[chat room]], many, many times:
<pre>
(_)_)=/=UUUU=====D
(_)_)==/=UUUU====D
(_)_)===/=UUUU===D
(_)_)====/=UUUU==D
(_)_)=====/=UUUU=D
(_)_)====/=UUUU==D
(_)_)===/=UUUU===D
(_)_)==/=UUUU====D
(_)_)=/=UUUU=====D
</pre>

== *headdesk* ==
This emote conveys the act of ''slamming one's head into their desk''. This is generally assumed to be due to [[extreme]] [[frustration]] -- perhaps because the store is out of [[fat|donuts]], or because [[fandom|someone totally took Harry out of context]] in that last [[fanfic]]. Repeated impacts of the human skull upon inanimate objects can cause head or brain trauma, and subsequently the belief that emotes are [[funny]] and useful methods of communication.<br/>Variations include: *headkeyboard*, *slaps forehead* and *handpenis*.

== *facepalm* ==
{{main|Facepalm}}
[[Facepalm]] is both a meme and an emote, and has generated hundreds of lulzy pictures of [[Captain Picard]] and others covering their face with their palm, in an ostensible expression of ''"Goddamn, [[WTF]] is this shit?''" There is also a furry-based variation of this emote known as *''[[facepaws]]''*.

== *[[ellipsis]]* ==
{{main|ellipsis}}
[[Irony|...........]]

For even bolder and more [[fail]]-filled irony, say "[[...]]" [[IRL]] rather than trailing off like a [[normal]] [[human being]].
