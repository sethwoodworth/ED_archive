[[Image:Guronasty.jpg|thumb| [[win|No to furries, yes to this.]]]]Once upon a time, [[Anonymous|somebody]] looked at the chaos that was [[4chan]], and said: ''Lo, [[wtf]] is this [[shit]]? [[Furry|Furries]] and [[CP|child porn]]? Verily, it must be that we shall make a promised land, full of violence to deter the [[furry|fucking furfags]] from arriving. And we shall make them [[animu|anime]] chicks, so that we can still fap to it.''

And so, this [[random]] maker of the website sat down and said: ''[[Engrish|What can the fuck is I to do now make for this?]]'' - but lo, an [[stoned|angel]] descended from the ceiling and spake unto [[fgt|him]]. Or [[16-year-old girl|her]].

And he said: ''Play... the best [[music|soooong]]... in the world... or I'll eat your [[iPod|souls]]''. Or maybe not; that could have been the [[radio]] in the background. But the [[anonymous]] creater of gurochan was inspired. And lo, they did [[Deleting your LiveJournal|make a website]].

And verily, the site was [[creationist|finished]], and filled with [[shit]] and [[guro]], and the [[sick fuck|sick fucks]] of the [[internets|intertubes]] migrated there. And it was [[crap|good]].

==Statistics==
[http://www.gurochan.net Gurochan] is a spinoff of [[4chan]] dedicated to [[Guro]] - or gross anime pictures featuring death and gore, as well as pictures of [[shit]], and [[retard|freaks]]. It's run by Chiisai, a [[13-year-old boy]], and a popular character in the slashfic writen by the lonely [[emo]]kids who frequent the site. <del>If you want to troll the site, I suggest you start a thread using the name [[jissouseki|jessy]] (put it in the 'subject' field) on every board, and compare the site's owners to [[Hitler]] and/or [[Stalin]] because they forced you to post anonymously. Also be sure to make reference to the International Jewery.</del><br /><p>

It should be noted that gurochan does not allow [[furry]] art. That's right, Gurochan does not want any [[sick fucks]] mixing in with their normal, healthy Gurochan users who just want to come in and beat off to some good, wholesome animated murder porn. <del> They also don't want sick lolicon fucks posting on their site</del>.  However, ironically, they hope to high hell lolicon stays legal, because if animated child pornography is treated like real child pornography, then animated explicit murder would be illegal, also.

Please note that [[war porn]] is not guro. Nor are pictures of traffic accidents or anything like that. Gore =/= guro.

People also come to Gurochan in order to find picktures of [[shit]] being smeared on people's [[tits]] and [[cock]] in an impression of this being worthy of [[masturbation|fapping]] or [[lulz]]. Amazingly, they still feel that [[furry]] art is more disgusting, so you won't be worried about finding [[metal (furry)|furfags]] in the post where you [[masturbation|are fapping]] over [[crap|animated scat pr0n]].

Gurochan is also the primary housing site for a phenomenon called [[Jissouseki]], where millions of [[idiot|enlightened viewers]] can watch the sick fucks being smashed, cooked, raped, ripped apart, gutted, fumigated, poisoned, blown up, and all manner of other things that people go to Gurochan's /g/ board for. Given that [[jissouseki|desu trolls]] love to shit their green pussy juice over everything, the /s/ board is also perfect for their actions.

No. Their board made for housing non-human freaks of nature is not an appropriate place for jissou.

==Gurochan turning on demographic?==
A user was [[b&]] [[last Thursday]] for posting [[Dissected-chan]].
Turn out they only want Drawings and not photos on there. Makes perfect sense!
