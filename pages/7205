Salute

A '''salute''' is a photo taken by [[internets]] users, especially [[LiveJournal]] users, to verify their identities. The salute photo usually includes a full face shot and a message including the individual's username and some stupid community-specific phrase. Lined notebook paper is a favored material for the message, the idea being that messages on lined paper are immune from [[Photoshop]] and are therefore infallible identity devices.
   
The salute was probably invented by a [[camwhore]] as a way to show off to a captive audience. Though completely useless when compared to sharing [[IRL]] [[dox]], it also carries less danger of [[identity theft]]. Salutes have become an initiating device into many different LJ [[Community|communities]].
  
One of the quickest ways to bring [[internet drama]] to an otherwise happy community is to require all current members to produce an original salute or risk being [[banned]]. The drama comes in two flavors: those who seek to find the most [[offensive]] way to create their salutes, and those who call a [[waaaambulance]] because they don't have access to a digital camera and are therefore being excluded. If the requirement of a salute doesn't cause enough drama on its own, [[moderator]]s and other community members can amplify the situation by accusing posters of certain salutes of being [[poser]]s.
