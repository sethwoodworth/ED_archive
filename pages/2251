Did he die?
{{needsmoar|pretty pictures of death}}
'''Did he die''' is a [[unfunny|hilarious]] [[meme]] originating from some [[faggot]]'s [[Fail Blog]] video on [[YouTube]]. It was originally used to make fun of the [[butthurt|concerned]] viewers, but [[at least 100]] /b/tards found the comments lulzy, and reposted [[for the lulz]]. Like [[typical]] [[copypasta]], it was funny the first few times, but it soon turned into another forgotten version of [[desu]], and is now regarded as [[lie|the biggest, funniest meme for]] [[the cancer that is killing /b/|YouTubers]].<br/>Originally, [[YouTube]]rs looking for [[lulz]] would post this comment on videos where someone was injured or somehow harmed. This quickly spread into other videos which obviously contained [[pain]], [[gore]] or potential [[lulz]] of any sort.
