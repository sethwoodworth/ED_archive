{{an hero}}

'''[[Charles Bishop]]''' was a [[13-year-old boy|15-year-old]] [[An Hero|Honor Student]] from East Lake high school (in fucking [[Florida]]) who became [[an hero]] by flying a small plane into a skyscraper. 

On January 9, 2002 Bishop stole a small plane and crashed it into the 28th floor of the Bank of America Plaza. Hoping to cause [[massive damage]] and kill thousands of people like [[9/11]], he was too stupid to realize he was only [[Fail|flying a Cessna]]. He only managed to [[suicide|kill himself]], what [[An Hero]]. 

This [[dumbfuck]] believed [[Osama bin Laden]] did [[9/11]] when we all know those fucking [[Jews]] [[Jews did WTC|did it]]. Not only that, but later his [[dumbshit]] mom decided his [[acne]] medication was to blame. The Jews at [[Wikipedia]] list him as an "amateur terrorist"...which is an affront to actual terrorists ([[moot]]). On a [[moar]] [[lulz]]worthy note, the loser ate [[cock]]. Lots of cock.
