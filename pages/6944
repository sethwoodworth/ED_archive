'''''Resident Evil 3''''', or "'''RE3'''" as it is known by [[fantards|acronym-savvy fans]], is a "survival-horror" game developed by [[Capcom]]. However, the term [[Africa|"survival horror"]] can be quite misleading, as there is no mention that while surviving the horror, the player must solve more puzzles than [[Bitch|Carol Vorderman]] could shake a stick at.

The story revolves around a [[tits|well endowed]] protagonist, '''Jill Valentine''', and her nerve shattering hell-ride through Raccoon City. The main aim of the game is to help Jill find some clothes to help cover herself up ([[fanservice|or not]]), and if the player so chooses, escape the [[cunnilingus|carnage]] of a [[zombie]] [[crabs|infestation]] before the city is [[pwned|annihilated]].

It inter-relates with the other series of the games, and is set:
*At least 100 days after the events of [[last Thursday|''Resident Evil 1''. (Or ''Zero''. Or both.) ]]
*24 hours before and after the events of ''Resident Evil 2''. 
*Concurrently between both ''[[Resident Evil Outbreak]]'' Files #1 and #2.
*13 days before ''Resident Evil: [[Hello Kitty]] Island Adventure'' takes place.

...Still keeping up?

== Setting ==

'''[[Detroit|Raccoon City]]''' was a small Midwestern [[US]] town turned mega-city with a population of a lot until it was [[Japan|destroyed by a thermonuclear device]] in [[1990s|1998]], probably due to [[liberals]]. Its current population stands at 0. 

Founded [[last Thursday]] by a brigade of traveling [[Otherkin|super-smart raccoons]], many citizens found life in the small burg quite difficult. For example, to even leave one's house required the combination of several different keys all of which were scattered inconspicuously in closets and chests, which themselves required keys to be opened. Driving around town was an equally frustrating experience as most main roads tended to be blocked by stacks of burning cars and/or large crates. 

The Jumping Ban, imposed in 1995, made the navigation of these generic crates especially hard. According to one former resident of the town, visits to the local supermarket required a will of steel. As citizens could only carry 4 - 6 items at a time; '''''Would you like to replace your house key with 1 x tampon? Y/N''''' would've been a difficult choice to make.

However, some argue that solving puzzles while traversing the city actually improved the average citizen's IQ. This theory has been debunked on the grounds that those people with [[Asperger's Syndrome|supposedly high IQs]] managed to be [[Vore|devoured alive]].

The city now has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, mainly because everyone is [[dead]].

It was also formerly home to the Umbrella Corporation, the world's largest exporter of umbrellas and [[AIDS|nefarious mutagenic viruses]].

== Backstory ==

Jill and Chris Redfield were part of a [[retarded|special]] group of cops. One fateful night sometime back, they were sent to investigate why their helicopter [[an hero|fucking crashed]]. It was originally speculated that one of the people on-board had been previously [[shoop da woop|charging their laz0rs]].

A [[lulz]]y adventure ensues in a large mansion where Jill and Chris discover, to their utmost horror that the cliché of zombie films are true! The [[Wal-Mart|Umbrella Corporation]], using the manufacture of [[not funny|medium sized economy umbrellas as a front]], have been developing viral weapons, and [[OMG]] it's turned all the scientists into [[zombies]]!!1one!11 

After many [[drama|protracted battles]] and a plot that flips and flops like the footwear of the same name, the mansion is [[divide by zero|blown up]] and all traces of the viral outbreak (henceforth christened the '''[[AIDS|T-Virus]]''', as it was first discovered in a [[Tea Party|cup of tea]] in [[Maine]]), are eradicated. Chris and Jill, and various other characters of non-importance, escape and attempt to warn the world about the risk of [[pools closed|global AIDS]], followed by mass amounts of [[fried chicken]] and general [[faggotry]].

However, as this is 1998, and [[Pokémon|Pokémon Red & Blue]] are being launched, no-one can be bothered listening to them. 
Chris, in [[desperation]], leaves the country to have his [[Resident Evil 5|own sequel]]. (Because liek Leon totally got ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''.)

[[dumbass|Jill decides to remain]] in Raccoon City, mainly because <strike>'''if she didn't, there wouldn't be a game!'''</strike> she's a [[woman]] and [[Fact|cannot make intelligent choices]]. Duh.

== Plot ==

[[Image:Re3box.jpg|Thumb|250px|right]]

The [[AIDS|T-Virus]] has reached the [[ghetto|streets]] of Raccoon City, turning the local people into [[Vampire|blood thirsty]] and/or [[Republican|flesh hungry monsters]]. 

Jill, realizing this is a [[period|situation]] a woman just can't handle, decides to [[GTFO]] of town while she still can. Upon meeting fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer, '''Brad Vickers''' in a bar, she is warned of a [[Ron Jeremy|stalker that is hunting remaining ''S.T.A.R.S'' members]], and this time it's not just limited to [[Facebook]]. 

The two split up [[doing it wrong|(because it wouldn't make sense to work together)]] but manage to meet up again at the local police station. Wreaking heavily of [[guro]] and [[prostitution]], the stalker is revealed to be none other than '''"[[Bubba|Nemesis]]"''' - a rather [[fugly]] assassin deployed by the [[CIA]] to silence Jill and the [[Nobody|rest of her team]] (more evidence that women just won't [[STFU]].) Nemesis [[raep|skullfucks]] Brad with a [[List of Porn Parodies#A Critical Synopsis of Edward Penishands|giant penis coming out of his arm]] and Jill, doing what only a woman can, runs away. 

Taking shelter in the police station, Jill hears a distress call from what sounds like a [[English is not my native language|foreigner]]. It's only then she realizes this really ''is'' the Apocalypse - when the majority of the white middle classes have been eaten alive and the [[wetbacks]] roll in to claim the [[Los Angeles|'burbs]]. 

Upon finding a lockpick, Jill (The Master of Unlocking) can finally open that pesky [[Fail|flimsy wooden door]] that's been blocking her path for 2 hours. After many more hours of sleuthing down alleyways and conveniently placed [[shit|sewers]], Jill rendezvous with the person who made the distress call, a zombie named '''Carlos Oliviera''' who happened to swim to the scene from [[Cuba]].

However, just when you think she could finally team up with someone who has an assault rifle, Nemesis arrives. Jill once again does what she does best and bolts for the door. Honestly, women these days! Luckily, the duo manage to meet again at a nearby tram station, as it turns both have an almighty fetish for [[mantrain|mass transit]].

The next 36-38 hours of gameplay are spent building a new engine from scratch to get the tram operational. [[Srsly]].

When they manage to get the tram going and there's a slight chance they may just be able to escape the big nasty black person hunting them down for [[chikins]], they realize the brakes don't work. Oops! After the tram [[buttsecks|crashes]] into a clocktower, Jill gets [[raped]] by Nemesis and is knocked unconscious, infected by [[teh]] [[AIDS]]. The player must then take control of Carlos, who must save Jill by creating a vaccine in Raccoon Hospital.'''**''' 

After he [[stick it in her pooper|administers it to Jill]], she comes to, and both of them proceed to kick Nemesis' ass in the final showdown. Carlos radios for help, and none other than '''Barry Burton''', a character from RE1 (infamous for his want of a [[Sammich|Jill Sandwich]]) arrives in a helicopter to save the day. 

They lift off just in time to see Raccoon City [[pwned]] by the [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|U.S.]] government's ejaculatory Thermonuclear Missile, destroying all evidence of the T-Virus and the race of super-raccoons, [[JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!|which were rumored to live in the sewers of the city]]. 

The closing cutscene shows Carlos acquiring his visa.

== Characters ==

[[Image:Jill_Valentine_Umbrella_Chronicles.jpg|thumb|right|Jill. <strike>Note the distinct lack of clothing</strike>'''LOLWUT'''.]]

*'''Jill Valentine''' - Protagonist for both RE1 and RE3. In ''S.T.A.R.S'', she is in charge of the [[ass|rear]]. The game could've been completed twice as fast if she wasn't originally chained to the kitchen. She goes by the motto, "[[in the kitchen|A good woman knows her place]]."

*'''Carlos Oliveira''' - Introduced into the game to rectify the testosterone imbalance. A member of ''U.B.C.S'', Umbrella's fuck-up crew. He handles heavy weapons and is only useful for pushing bells in clocktowers, and pushing balls through his [[asshole]]. Originally from [[Colombia|South America]], he is currently applying for a visa to gain legal entry to the United States and continue his main job of gardening the front yards of white wimminz.

*[[Putin|'''Nicholai Ginovaef''']] - [[In Soviet Russia|Imported from Russia]], he loves long walks on the beach and orienteering.

*'''Mikhail Victor''' - He followed Nicholai to Raccoon City by stowing away on the fucking boat.  Also from Russia. 

*'''Brad Vickers''' - Nicknamed "Chickenheart" because he's a pussy and more sexually vulnerable than [[Ohbutyouwillpet|a four-month-old baby]], he was a fellow ''S.T.A.R.S'' member who found himself on the wrong end of Nemesis' almighty [[Tentacle Grape|tentacle bondage]].

*[[guido|'''Dario Rosso''']] - A [[fat]], stubborn civilian of Raccoon City who, rather stupidly, refused to escape with Jill. Rumored to have Type 5 [[Diabeetus]].

== Gameplay ==

In brief:
<youtube>Hlz2ZjwtS0w</youtube>

<youtube>fjd62GU5MT0</youtube>

Pretty much all you do in the whole game is run about in faggot camera angles looking for typewriters (HAVE THEY NOT HERD OF [[INTERNETS]] YET?!) and try to shoot zombie [[niggers]] in the crotch. This makes the game very hard: You can't aim for shit because the controls suck like [[7chan]] users on their own penises.

== Trivia ==

[[Image:Mixedherb.jpg|thumb|right|Herbs: All the cool kids are doing [[drugs|it]]!]]

*The men almost always have more health than the woman playable characters in the games. Just like [[IRL]]!

*Raccoon City was famous for its esteemed writers. The city had the highest typewriter:person ratio of any metropolitan area on the planet.

*Raccoon City's football team were called the "Raccoon Sharks"...because it wouldn't make sense to call them the "Raccoon Raccoons".

*A brand of soda found in vending machines in the city is called "Juicy Raccoon" - delicious.

*Resident Evil fans are extremely gullible. Capcom somehow convinced them that shitty tank controls are somehow "challenging". If Capcom decides to tell them that playing the game with the controller lodged up someone's anus is challenging, the fans will eat that shit up.
