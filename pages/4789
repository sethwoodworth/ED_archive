Legacy of Kain
[[Image:Lokretards1.PNG|thumb|Ever heard that saying "the fans have a way of ruining/killing the series?" This is a perfect example.]]
Legacy of Kain is a [[shit]] game series about [[vampires]] who travel through time and fight [[aliens]]. 

Although it was created with [[goth]] fags who play [[video games|vidya gaems]] in their parents' basement in mind, retarded [[fangirls]] who exist to prove [[rule 34]] got a hold of it and ruined it. Never mind the fact that all of the characters are ugly old men and [[yaoi|slashing]] them means your crappy fanart or fanfic will contain [[necrophilia]] and/or [[incest]], Rule 34 exists for a reason. 

Despite having a fairly standard video game [[shit nobody cares about|plot]], it does feature [[stolen|inventive]] block puzzles, signifying times before games were dumbed down to suit the ADD-riddled minds of [[you|13 year old boys]]. While providing a casual challenge for [[13 year old boys|you]], they cause the aforementioned to break their consoles and become [[an hero]].



== Characters ==

===Kain===

[[Image:KainScowl.jpg|thumb|Kain's pissed because too many [[fangirls]] pair him up with men.]]
Has a foul temper and quite the habit of talking to himself. [[At least 100 years ago | Back in the first game]], Blood Omen, he got [[rape | stabbed]] by a bunch of [[faggots | random red shirts]] behind a bar, then came back as a [[vampire | goth]] and slaughtered the better half of the population. At the end of the game, Kain had the choice to either be a [[nice guys | good guy]] or rule [[ebaums | Nosgoth]] for [[at least 100 years | at least 100 more years]], the latter being the obvious choice. In Blood Omen 2, literally [[100 years ago | 100 years later]], [[Hitler | Kain]] decided to initiate a [[holocaust | gothocaust]], effectively ridding the world of [[furries | everyone and everything he deemed unfit for his new world order]]. However, [[moot | some weird-ass looking skeleton asshole]] was butthurt over something that happened [[at least 100 years ago | 100 years ago]] and decided to fuck with Kain for the [[lulz]]. At the end of the game, Kain threw the skeleton guy into a [[goatse | black hole]] or something.

In Soul Reaver, [[emo]] [[faggot]] Raziel was introduced as the main character and bastard offspring of Kain (along with [[shit nobody cares about | five of Kain's other dirty, illegitimate emo kids]] who's name no one bothers to remember). [[Butthurt]] over Raziel growing wings before him, Kain had his emo ass thrown into a [[goatse | black hole]], too. Raziel returns like 1,000,000 years later as some sort of blue, [[eating disorder | bulimic]] gothic wetdream with [[blowjob | no lower jaw]]. Knowing that Raziel was coming to kill him, Kain decided to line up his other five sons for slaughter first, [[lulz | because he thought it was funny]]. Raziel finds Kain and fails to kill him because he's too busy [[emo | CRAAAAAAAWLING IN HIS SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN]].

Same exact shit happens in Soul Reaver 2, only with the introduction of Janos Audron for retarded fangirls to slash. 

In Legacy of Kain: Defiance, Kain talks to himself more, then breaks into a fortress and slaughters everyone for no reason other than the fact that he's a huge dick.

Meanwhile, Raziel was too busy angsting over the loss of Janos and being a tool to do anything useful. He eventually picked a fight with Kain and just managed to [[pwned|pwn]] him, then ran off with his heart so he could raise Janos (even though [[irony | it was actually Raziel himself]] who killed Janos [[over 9000]] times). However, due to Kain having more testosterone than a bull moose on epinephrine, he [[divide by zero | tears a hole in reality]], slaughters a bunch of people for no good reason, and goes home.

===Raziel===

[[Image:Kain12.jpg|thumb|Nothing says "I love you" better then tearing out someone's heart]]
An [[emo]] [[bitch]] and [[an hero]] of Soul Reaver, Soul Reaver 2, and Defiance. At first, Raziel looked like a proper emo boi with his shirt off, and had a pair of wings, complete with pseudo-goth wear native to the time. This only lasted for about twenty seconds before Kain got tired of his [[metrosexual]] ass and gave him a swirrlie he would never forget.

Since then, Raziel follows in Kain's footsteps, killing things, and talking to himself, though he does so with quite a lot more emo, and a lot less rage. 

Throughout Soul Reaver, Raziel spent most of his time yelling and killing his brothers, but when Soul Reaver 2 came out, his motto changed a good deal, no thanks to yet more emo and manipulations of some random fuckers. Defiance wasn't too different, as the both of them did a good deal of talking to themselves, and killing things, although Raziel himself became [[pwned|shanked]] in one last act to redeem his emo self.

===Vorador===
[[Image:Legacyoffurfags.jpg|thumb|Legacy of [[Furfags]]? Epic fail.]]
The original  big green [[pimp]] of Nosgoth to many a fan. Easily bored, arrogant, and a generally unpleasant fellow, more so the day the Sarafan gained access to his Sire's keep (no thanks to that [[emo]] bastard, Raziel), [[DO NOT WANT|screamed]], crashed the Guardians' party and [[pwned]] their asses. They apparently did not like this very much for they in turn -- also no thanks to someone else -- beheaded him in response. 

In Blood Omen 2, Vorador came back to life somehow, head intact, with no explanation. He realized that [[One does not simply X into Mordor|he needed help]] kicking some [[ugly]] bastard's ass, he recruited Kain to do so, but lost one of his [[whores]] in the process. 

In Soul Reaver 2 and Defiance, Vorador doesn't do anything but tell Raziel that he's a [[retard]], and then he walks away. Also worth noting that Vorador keeps the corpse of his dad in his basement.

===Janos Audron===

Vorador's dad and the [[bitch]] in almost every LoK [[yaoi]] fan couple that he's involved in. [[Over 9000]] years ago, Sarafan Raziel [[buttsex|raeped]] his chest and took his heart. Janos manages to come back, only to be [[pwned]] several times over throughout the rest of the series.

===Moebius===

An old guy who [[troll|pisses everybody off]]. He ends up tricking and manipulating everyone, including Kain, every step of the way because they're all [[retarded]] enough to believe what he says -- and when they refuse to, they don't realize it's just reverse psychology. Everybody in the game gets [[butthurt|pissed]] at his deceitful character, so he ends up getting his head cut off in Blood Omen 1, and then Kain and Raziel impale him in Defiance so the [[tentacle rape|tentacle monster]] can abuse him.

===The Elder God===

The [[tentacle rape|tentacle monster]] who violates Raziel, Moebius, and apparently [http://games.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=600080634 Janos] as well. Some claim that he is the hub of the wheel, while others call him a [[cancer]]. One thing's certain: nobody cares.

===Characters who don't matter===

*'''Raziel's Brethren''' - [[Anonymous]] because they do not forgive. AKA: a bunch of [[fags]].
*'''Ariel''' - Is missing large chunks of flesh and tends to give Raziel competition when it comes to [[emo]]
*'''Umah''' - Vorador's [[bitch]] who betrayed Kain because she didn't want his [[Legacy of Kain|Kain]][[AIDS]]. Although Kain said that she could've been his queen, we all know that this means [[denial|he never liked her]]. Poses as a huge threat to [[yaoi]] fangirls everywhere, seeing that her only purpose in LoK was to prove that Kain isn't gay.
*'''The Pillar Guardians''' - More [[fags]]. With [[Diabeetus]]
*'''The Sarafan Lord''' - The bad guy who was forgotten completely by fans everywhere when Blood Omen 2 ended.
*'''Hash'ak'gik''' - He [[Divide by zero|Divided by zero]] and lost.

== Fandom ==
[[Image:Kainsandwich.jpg|thumb|right|If you found that kinky, kill yourself.]]

The [[yaoi]] fangirls of this series put [[Snapesnogger]] to shame with their [[bullshit]]. Yeah, they're ''that'' bad. As stated above, not only do they find ugly old men hot, they are also aroused at the sight of suggested [[incest]] (Kain fucking his sons and Janos fucking his sons), [[rape]], [[necrophilia]], the list goes on. Some fans are just [[batshit insane]], or suffering from a horrible case of [[denial]] (mostly [[GoddessMillenia]] and Ramesya of [[DeviantART]].

Those who aren't into any of the above are usually [[goth|goths]], [[emo|emokids]], [[nerd|nerds]], or all of the above. They still get off debating fifteen year-old plot details and believe that Legacy of Kain is [[serious business]], thus making them only slightly less [[fail]]. Most of them are [[butthurt]] that no one else plays the games besides them.

'''EDIT:''' Apparently the [[furfags]] are into LoK as well. Honestly, who didn't see this coming?
'''EDIT 2.0:''' DISREGARD, I SUCK COCKS. It's actually just one [[furfag]] who pollutes the rest of the fanfaggotry with his furry versions of the characters.

=== LoK [[lol-cow|lolcows]]===


http://www.youtube.com/user/jmpawloski 
this fucktard has gone one step farther than most retards and made his own piece of shit game based on KainAIDS inc.
Fuckaholic liked screwing with the whole story to satisfy his gay fantasies.

[[Image:Millieyoutubelulzagain.png|thumb|right|People like [[GoddessMillenia|Millie]] are the reason why it is humiliating to admit that you are a fan of the series.]]

http://www.youtube.com/user/nadjibw : This paranoid satanist fucktard spends all his pathetic wake moments with hunting for encoded satanist shit in every pixels, believes he discovered a fucking epic conspiracy calls it the Legacy of Kain BEYOND THE TRUTH: Eidos is owned by the Illuminati/Satan/AntiChrist, their attempt is to pwn the world through videogames, he is the chosen one paranoid fucktard who has the gift to see encoded message of the Satan nobody else can read, even Raziel's fart carries the symbol of a secret conspiracy. He is a self-proclaimed "genius"  total lulz.


*{{deviantart|scereyahadreamweaver|scereyahadreamweaver}}: This fucked up piece of necrophiliac shit will argue with you,threaten you with beng banned by her "holy order" of lulzcows cock-puppets,and probably lecture you on the 10 rules of lok yaoi-ism and why it's fucking O.K to watch gay dead-vampires having sex. In need of some MAJOR butt-hurt and opinion rape. Pipe any feed on ED, lulz guaranteed.


*{{deviantart|ramesya|Ramesya}}: A self admitted "Crazy fangirl" who's only purpose in life is to make gay and alien parings and spend the rest of her useless life drooling and masturbating over them. TROLL IT, as well as the sickening gay clubs she watches, she's addicted to cocksucking blind bats and Raziel's non-existant penis.


*{{deviantart|jewel-reaver|Jewel-Reaver}}: Another gay lover,not as retarded as most but still worth a mention,her art is pure shit,and her love of yaoi is kept under tight control from most of her friends although she is a member of Yaoi clubs. Anyway, her shit production came to a screeching halt as she was [[Banned IRL]] by [http://idigoddpairings.deviantart.com/journal/25010367/ Deep Vein "Thrembosis."]


*'''[[GoddessMillenia]]:''' The queen of LoK lolcows, so retarded she deserved her own ED article. She also happens to be a [[sick fuck]] who thinks that Raziel putting the Soul Reaver [[in the ass|up his ass]] would be hot. Attempted to delete this article and hers not one but [[fail|twice]].  


*'''[[DJRaziel]]:''' Another person who's retarded enough to have their own article. He's [[GoddessMillenia]]'s [[bitch|boyfriend]], suspected [[pedobear]], and an [[Internet Tough Guy]]. Do not mess with him. He will look you up on google and [[pwn]] you while [[masturbate|fapping]] to good old fashioned Kain/Raziel yaoi. And by "look you up on google", we mean that he tries to dig up dirt on you but [[fail|fails miserably]]. He also believes that [[denial|creating things on a parody website doesn't effect anybody]], which obviously isn't the case, since he and his [[16 year old girl|girlfriend]] are still pissy over it [http://youtube.com/profile?user=GoddessMillenia].  


*'''[[VegetaWorshipper]]:''' The name alone [[DBZ|says a lot]]. VegetaWorshipper (pronounced [[faggot]]) is a [[batshit insane]] [[16 year old girl]] who was responsible for making not only fucked up [http://vegetaworshipper.deviantart.com/ fanart], but a shitty [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/165372 flash video] as well. Although she shows impressive artistic skills, a quick browse through her DeviantART gallery proves that she is [[retarded|beyond redemption]]. Probably because her gallery (especially on her website) consists of [[yaoi]], [[necrophilia]], both mostly both. Needless to say, she is a [[sick fuck]].  


*'''Akane:''' A [[shitty]] artist. She was the first, and for many years, the only [[fucktard]] to create LoK [[yaoi]]. Her shitty [[fanart]], mostly Kain/Raziel, arouses 85% of [[16 year old girls]] in this [[retarded]] fandom.    


*'''[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/564370/Laryna6 Laryna6]:''' A [[fanfiction]] author who has [[at least 100]] stories consisting of nothing but [[you are doing it wrong|really badly written]] sex scenes. She's responsible for making practically every character in Legacy of Kain a [[slut]]. Her favorite couples include Elder God/Janos, Sarafan Raziel/Janos, Kain/Raziel, and Janos/Vorador. Needless to say, she likes [[tentacle rape]], [[incest]], and [[aids]]. Also worth noting that she finds it hot when you call your significant other "My son" during sex. See [http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3641219/1/Hush this shitty fanfic] for proof.  


*'''[http://azuresorrow.livejournal.com/profile Azuresorrow]:''' A Blood Omen 2 [[fanboy]] who will get pissy if you say [[denial|that Blood Omen 2 wasn't the best game in the series]].  


*'''[[Derpaviangott]]:''' Yet ''another'' person retarded enough to have their own article. He is a [[fucktard]] who wishes that [[Hitler]] was still alive so he can throw all the anti-yaoi fans into the oven.

*'''[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/50232/DragonSeerDragonSeer Dragonseer]:''' Another fanfiction author who [[Deleting your LiveJournal|quit Fanfiction.net forever]] after everybody got tired of her [[shitty]] third installment of her [[Tomb Raider]]/Soul Reaver [[crossover]] series. She responds to flames in the most [[bullshit|mature]] way ever, even using threats such as [[Internet Tough Guy|" My next action will be to report you to fanfic, and I’m positive I have enough friends on here to make you’re life miserable."]] Also worth adding, she supports a pairing between Kain and a girl that Kain has known since she was four and grew up calling [[pedobear|"Uncle Kain"]]. Needless to say, she is a [[sick fuck]].

=== Legacy of [[Legacy of Kain|Kain]][[AIDS]] ===
[[Image:Lokfags.jpg|thumb|More [[shitty art]] from VegetaWorshipper, titled "Raziel is a Slut". Please self pwn.]]

Because the fans have turned Kain into such a [[whore]], [[Legacy of Kain|Kain]][[AIDS]] came into existence. After Kain was shanked by a Sarafan, he received some kind of HIV virus which transformed him into a vampire, thus the [[Legacy of Kain|Kain]][[AIDS]] were born. He then traveled town to town, banging all the men and sleeping women, as well as those bitches who are [[asking for it|chained to the wall]], before he eventually banged Vorador. Because Vorador and Janos are apparently [[gay]] lovers, Vorador spread the [[Legacy of Kain|Kain]][[AIDS]] to his sire, as well as his millions of [[whores|brides]]. And because Raziel and his brethren are Kain's [[bitches]], you know that they've been infected. Although Umah didn't want [[Legacy of Kain|Kain]][[AIDS]], chances are she got it from Vorador, since she's his [[slut]] 'n all.

Eventually [[Legacy of Kain|Kain]][[AIDS]] spread into the LoK fandom, turning obsessive fangirls and fanboys alike into [[GoddessMillenia|retarded raving lunatics]]. There is no cure for [[Legacy of Kain|Kain]][[AIDS]], and everyone who's infected will most likely [[an hero|die a horrible death]], for better or worse.

'''Fun fact:''' Because Kain/[[Hitler]] is canon, [[Hitler]] also has [[Legacy of Kain|Kain]][[AIDS]]. [[srsly]].

===Ways to [[Butthurt]] an LoK Fan===

[[Image:Loknazi.PNG|thumb|What happens when you let a yaoi fantard run a [[faggot|COMMUNITAH]].]]

*Write an anti-[[yaoi]] fanfiction and post it on Fanfiction.net. Subsequent [[lulz]] is bound to occur.
*Tell [[GoddessMillenia]] that Kain/Raziel is not canon.
*Tell [[KCR1987]] that Raziel is yours.
*Go to an LoK Yaoi fanart and say "eww, yaoi"
*Talk bad about LoK yaoi on [http://community.livejournal.com/legacy_of_kain/profile this community]
*Say that [http://akane72.bravepages.com/ Akane] is a shitty artist.
*Say that any of the main male characters aren't hot.
*Draw a picture of [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/19039692/ Kain and Moebius kissing] and send it to a Kain/Raziel fangirl.
[[Image:Lokmadeoffail.PNG|thumb|This is a typical LoK [[fangirl]] speaking...]]
*[[Flame]] their [[fanfiction]]. Then laugh when they respond.
*Say that Kain/Umah (or just Umah on her own) is the greatest ever. You wouldn't believe how many [[retard|people]] will get [[butthurt|pissed off]] if you do this.
*Tell the people at [http://lok_clan.deviantart.com/ lok_clan] about this article.
*Tell [[fangirls]] at [http://lokfangirls.deviantart.com/ Lokfangirls] that fangirling sucks. [[Lulz ]] guaranteed.
*Say that [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrwGgu7hD4o Kain's a fucking alcoholic] and that Janos needs a bag of weed.
*Tell the artist of [http://vladimirsangel.deviantart.com/art/Kain-Sketch-5159596 this picture] that she is a gigantic faggot.

== Speaking of Nazis... ==

As if the series couldn't be raped enough, there is a rumor that [[Nazi]] director [[Uwe Boll]] (known for his [[shitty|fabulous]] films, such as House of the Dead and Bloodrayne) is attempting to create a Legacy of Kain movie. [[Fans]] everywhere died from incredibly violent [[suicide|suicides]] the moment they heard about it.

==Drama Sightings==

The most famous drama sightings would be [http://youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&v=xM57qXMPi-w&fromurl=/watch%3Fv%3DxM57qXMPi-w here] and [http://youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&v=9qVSrD---XI&fromurl=/watch%3Fv%3D9qVSrD---XI here]. Those who've visited [[GoddessMillenia]]'s article know what to expect. Sometime ago, somebody wrote a [[fanfic]] called "Down With Yaoi", where the LoK characters caused the deaths of many [[Yaoi]] [[fangirls]]. The [[butthurt]] fans ended up having the [[homophobic]] story taken off of Fanfiction.net, despite the fact that the story was bashing [[fangirls]] and not [[homosexuals]].

Most drama sightings occur when people [[flame]] or [[troll]] LoK fanfiction. Such as here:

*[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1385434/10/Paradox Paradox by Shadowrayne]. 
*[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1269093/13/Tomb_Raider_and_Soul_Reaver_Rose_and_Thorn Chapter 13] of "Tomb Raider and Soul Reaver: Rose and Thorn" by Dragonseer

*[http://www.fanfiction.net/r/1269093/ The Review Page] for Dragonseer's TR/SR fanfic. Her fans, being [[lol-cow|lolcows]], believe that Dragonseer is [[serious business]], as you can see here:


{{quote|<small>TJ*Cracking knuckles*...a first for me..
Rikumon*looking *** And for me too...before we we’re angry like this
TJ: Because of MANY people...but now? Just one*Takes out list of Bunny in the ** hole’s reviews* Lets see now, for your ‘pleasant’ review about the subcharacters. 1)Liking a person who is deceased and willing to digest sickening contents to prove so, if liking a person enough to do that is so stupid. Then might I ask what would you do? 2)Wanting to know about your friends is natural, Im guessing from your response you don’t have many friends in which to speak of? And 3)Exatly how are they annoying. In comparison to you that is?
Rikumon*Takes list*Im in on this TJ, the comment that those guys made about how they were holding up the place. If it is ‘such stupid **’ then tell us oh brilliant one, what have the character’s in your fics said? 
TJ*Looks again with a twitching eyebrow*Rose and the Authoress are stupid hookers ne? Well tell me this, for Rose’s case, if sleeping with the one person you love deeply is being classed as a “Hooker” then I guess you must have slept with thousands of people, in fact I think I know guys in a gutter who’s said something about a good time with a “Bunny” and the authoress is stupid? If she’s so stupid, then why is it she has over a hundred reviews before the thirtieth chapter and you, who hasn’t even posted ONE fic on this site get nothing but flames from even your fellow Reviewers? Oh and Ill save that comment about native Americans for latter seeing that’s a common thing for you
Rikumon*Ahem* TJ and I both agree with this next one about us being, oh and its spelt evanescence, fans. But hey, at least DragonSeer has fans, while you only have a mass of people who want to tie you to a rocket aimed for space after hours of beatings and torture of course. If your so tough, give out your E-mail address then, and lastly if we don’t have lives, why is it you who hates this ENTIRE CATEGORY. Reading the story? If you don’t like LoK, OR TR, then don’t read the fic’s here, or even, just an idea, REVIEW THEM!
TJ: Now for the one about us, being fools and DS being the queen of **? 1)At least we don’t waste our time reading things we hate page after page for the only reason to insult others. And 2)If she is, shut your ** mouth cause then she’s your queen **.
Rikumon: If Virus’s art sucks, show all of us your wonderfully created works of art then ** head. And as said before, if you don’t like the games, then don’t even come here wasting our times with your retarded reviews.
TJ: And I shall finish off the last of it, now judging by the way you feel about Rose. I guess its probably jealousy that she found the one guy she likes and gets to be with him all the time, while you’re a lonely pus faced horse scaring beast who hasn’t seen the sun since the day you escaped from your cage. Oh and lastly for you ** hole dweller, the cleaners called, the white sheet with the hole in the middles finished, and the K groups moved to the big crater I blasted them in.
TJ and Rikumon: DragonSeer, you’re an amazing artist and authoress, keep up the great works. And if the ** keeps bothering you, give us a call and we’ll take care of the K loving **.</small>|[[faggot|TJ]] and [[furfag|Rikumon]]|[[tl;dr]].}}


On the other hand, drama occurs when you write something you know everybody will hate. Like [http://www.fanfiction.net/r/2193257/ here]. Fun Fact: GoddessMillenia takes this fanfic [[srsly]].


== EIDOS Sez: [[Fail|You Fail]] ==
Apparently the people at [[Eidos]] were getting sick of their game being constantly [[rape|raped]] by retarded [[fangirls]] everywhere (or they just took one look at [[GoddessMillenia]]'s DA page) and are contemplating to pull the plug on the series:
