'''Rush Limbaugh III''', '''El Rushbo''', '''Boss Limbaugh''', '''Mount Rushmore''', '''Jabba the Rush''', '''Santa Rush''', or '''Rush LimBAWWWW''' is a [[fat]], [[YouTube_Deaf_Jam|deaf]], [[neoconservative]] prick, and is most famous for translating ''Mein Kampf'' into [[English]] and re-titling the book as ''The Way Things Ought to Be''. Occasionally, Rush doubles as a professional [[comedian]], despite the fact that [[Republican]]s are [[Larry the Cable Guy|incapable of humor]]. His greatest passion is smoking cigars to simulate a black man's cock in his mouth.

'''Fun Fact:''' Rush is his [[srsly|real]] name. And it's a name with no end of comic possibilities. The mindset of his brain-dead followers can be described as "Lower Limbovia" (a play on the great satirist Al Capp's "Lower Slobbovia"). Rush on the radio is so much Baugh-Waugh-Waugh. How do you dance the Limbaugh? Every broadcast, lower the bar of decency and try to get under it...

==History==
[[Image:Rush-nou.jpg|thumb|right|NO U, McCain!]]

Limbawww was a military brat and is from a [[Fred Phelps|family of lawyers]] in [[Missouri]]. In fact, he actually has relatives in the District Supreme Court of Missouri. So if [[you]] [[Sane|hate him]] and live in Missouri, or are even slightly [[left wing]] (which is unlikely seeing as the Bible-belt is populated completely by [[Incest|cousin-fucking]] [[fundies]]), then you're fucked.  

After failing out of Southeast Missouri State University, the shitty backwater commuter college in his home town, he went to the [[Connecticut]] School of Broadcasting (where all radio hacks go to school when they're not good enough to go to a place like Cambridge), '''but he didn't even graduate, and is proud of it'''. Why he was anywhere near a blue state is anyone's guess. There, he joined the [[Republican]] Party and gave head to his god [[Ronald Reagan]] on a semi-regular basis.

At the end of the [[1980s]], he combed his Flock of Seagulls haircut, became a modern day warrior mean mean pride, and got a midday [[radio]] show. It became a rousing success, adored by [[conservatives]] and loathed by everyone else.

tl;dr:

At any one time, Rush Limbaugh is carrying more illegal pills than a Columbian street pusher in Miami. In 2003, Limbaugh was revealed to be a member of an illegal prescription drug ring, from which he regularly purchased [[Oxycontin]] and Hydrocodone [http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/10/10/rush.limbaugh/ (tl;dr version)].  [[W|One man]], who had partied with Rush, was recorded saying "I have never seen anyone snort, nor shove that much Oxy in their nose and ass at one time, I thought he was going to die!" In a [[emo|heartfelt]] broadcast, he apologized to his [[Republican|listeners]] by stating he was "addicted to prescription pain medication" and that he was "no role model," despite the fact that Christianity and conservatism are supposed to be [[concerned mother|family friendly]] and the only true way. 

He was also caught carrying a fairly sizable quantity of Viagra not prescribed to him when he returned from the Dominican Republic in mid 2006 [http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,44888,00.html (linkage)]. After getting [[Party Van|v&]] for felony prescription fraud and possession of a controlled substance, he avoided the inevitable [[buttsecks]] in a Federal Penitentiary by saying he was deeply [[sorry]] and checked into [[rehab]]. [[Irony|Aren't those damn illegal immigrant Mexicans supposed to be the ones bringing drugs into the country, validating closing the borders]]?

{{quote|OxyContin, methadone, vicadin, hydrocodone, Dilaudid if you're lucky, Darvocet, um... codeine, morphine if you can get it, heroin if you can't. Let's see, I also like Dermeral, Darvon, Fentanyl, and Percocet I guess. If I can't get any of these, I just chew some valarian root and punch holes in walls.|Rush Limbaww. So the only reason not to legalize pot is because it doesn't get you as high as vicodin or percocet. How Christian.[http://www.glossynews.com/artman/publish/limbaugh-weed.shtml]}}

In 2009 he was hilariously made official leader of the Republican Party and Michael Steele was forced to apologize for criticizing his show and for cheating on him with Glenn Beck.

==Obesity==
Like most conservatards from the South, Rush Limbaugh has historically been a [[fat|tremendous, morbidly obese shitbag]] throughout most of his adult life. There was a period of time where Limbaugh rapidly dropped a ton of weight with the help of drug abuse. During this period of being not as fat as he was before, Limbaugh snapped a shitload of photographs that he [[Fat Girl Angle Shot|recycled on his website in order to give the illusion of sustained weight loss]]. However, Limbaugh is still quite fat, as has long been evidenced on current clips displayed on his daily "Dittocam". The bottom line is, Rush Limbaugh is ''still'' a [[American|Big Fat Idiot]].

==Conservative Values==
[[Image:Rushinmycloset.jpg|thumb|Mooom! Please tell Rush that Christians are supposed to think [[masturbation]] is like [[abortion]], and an affront to [[God|GOD]]]]

As chief cheerleader for the shrill ultra-right wing of the Republican Party, Limbaugh walks the walk by living his life in accordance with established Republican values. When he's not giving blow jobs to [[George W. Bush]], Rush Limbaugh leads by example with such endeavors as illegally obtaining prescription narcotics and broken dick medicine; getting married and divorced 3 times in a solemn effort to ensure triple protection for the sanctity of marriage; and flying his fat ass to the Dominican Republic for some hot 9-year-old [[ladyboy]] action, with that illegally obtained broken dick medicine after his last divorce to take advantage of that country's extremely [[liberal]] stance on prostitution.  He also became deaf from having one too many cumshots land in his ear hole, and has since had a chip wired directly to Republican talking points radio wired into his skull.

==Stuttering and Hearing Loss==
[[Image:baugh.jpg|thumb|Rush doing what he does best (after OxyContin)]]
Rush Limbaugh stutters and stammers so abundantly during his self-dubbed "Excellence in Broadcasting" radio show, that he is the highest paid drug addicted, morbidly obese, convicted criminal impotent piece of shit on record.  [http://rushcongress.ytmnd.com/ This recent address to Congress] pretty much proved that he is beyond hope.

Deeply insecure about this own peech inspediment, Rush accused beloved actor [[Michael J. Fox]] of faking his Parkinson's Disease [[9000|shaky levels]] on TV to garner sympathy votes for a pro-[[Stem Cell Research|stem cell research]], [[Democrat]]ic advocate campaigning for Congress in the US [[2006]] mid-term elections.

After getting an earful of [[butthurt]] for this he was only slightly [[sorry]].

[http://www.metafilter.com/28723/Painkillers-destroy-hearing Due to his massive consumption] of [[House|Vicodin]] and [[Oxycontin#Oxycodone|Oxycontin's]] (he thought they were M&M's at first) he's also deaf, and can be seen with a hearing aid. This partly explains why [[noone]] can talk any sense into him. He needs a stenographer on the show to tell him what callers are saying. So how do we know if he's just a puppet of said stenographer? Who knows? He often has one-sided conversations with himself on air while pounding his desk, proving his insanity.

==Friend of the [[lulz]]==
Recently, this upstanding man has called for his loyal [[fucktards|Dittoheads]] to infiltrate the Democratic Party and vote for noted [[Muslim]] [[Barack Obama|Barack Muhammed Hussein Obama]], therefore indirectly electing action hero [[John McCain|John McClane]] and making the world safe for [[Republicans|democracy]]. To this end, he advocates riots and arson in Denver, the city where the Democratic National Convention was held in the 2008 [[Convention|DNC]]. When asked why, he said, "I did it for the lulz."

==Bring on the race war!==
In the midst of an increasingly tense presidential campaign, 
<s>[[KKK|Rush]] had a few choice words to say about [[black people]]</s> he had some black guy taking his place for him once, [[not racist|that's not racist, is it?]] [http://www.google.com/images?q=bill+ayers&sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS289US289 (and also apparently forgot that Bill Ayers isn't black)]:

==[[HNNNNNNGGGGG]]==

[[Last Thursday]], Rush Limbaugh suffered a [[overdose|heart attack]] while in [[Hawaii]].  Liberals throughout the world were jubilant about the possibility of Rush's impending [[death]].  Sadly, [[Twitter]]ing ''[[Unrealistic Expectations|"Rush Limbaugh is dead. TMZ to confirm in 10 minutes."]]'' will not make it become true.  Like [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Evildoer_Korea|Kim Jong-il]], Rush is likely to live forever proving that [[Atheism|God does not exist]].  Meanwhile, dittoheads were feeling butthurt over the fact that the majority of the public actually despises Limbaugh and think [[Truth|the world would be a better place without him]].  [[Hypocrites|They]] claim that [[Lie|Rush never celebrated the death or illness of any liberal]] and [[God hates fags|compassionate conservatives]] such as themselves are above such things.

==Rush gets [[Pwned]]==
While guest hosting Wheel of Fortune 2.0, various audience member [[Leftards|activists]] try to cause Rush [[butthurt]].  It begins around a minute into the video with one black person drama, which gets Rush's attention and [[lulz]] ensue. Holy shit [[LOL WUT|waht]]! Rush is not on the radio here!
