'''I am in your base killing your d00ds''' is a [[catchphrase]] that can be roughly translated to "[[LOL]] you got [[pwn]]ed and don't even know it yet."  It originated in on-line multiplayer [[retard|RTS]] [[video games|games]] such as ''[[Starcraft]]'' though specifically ''Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2''.  [[shit_nobody_cares_about|While player one was innocently building Tesla coils and general infantry]], player two is in player one's base, killing his d00ds.  Player one doesn't even notice, so player two sends him a message:
:'''I am in your base killing your d00ds.'''

This line can be used in many situations.  You can use it to tell your friend that you are fucking his wife or to tell a convenience store clerk he is being robbed.

Like any [[old meme]], it now produces [[anti-lulz]].


==[[Teh]] origin of this meme==
[[lie|Like all funny memes]], this meme originated on the [[SomethingAwful]] forums when a screenshot of a game of ''Starcraft'' was posted on the Games forum.

Two players (one unnamed, the other known as 1337h4x (leetspeak for "Fucking Nerd") are in a game of ''Starcraft'', with 1337h4x playing as the [[kekeke|Zerg]] race, and the other as either the Terran or Protoss races. 1337h4x [[Kekeke|Zerg-rushed]] his opponent, and on finding that he was getting raped, his opponent asked:

<n00b>dude, where are you? 

<1337h4x> '''im in ur base, killing ur d00ds'''

This meme was then used to death and abandoned by the forums, at which point it was picked up by the rest of the internets and from there became the utterly retarded LOLcats meme.

==Alternate Wordings==
The basic formula is "IM IN UR <noun> <verb>ING (UR/MY) <noun2>". Noun2 should always be plural, and end in a "Z" not an "S" otherwise [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG]].

* Im in ur base, killin ur troopz.
* I am in your fridge eating your f00dz.
*[[Jasmine Richardson|I am in your house killing your d00ds]].
* [[Virginia Tech massacre|IM IN UR CORREGE KIRRING UR KIDZ]].
* I am in your sweatshop making ur sh00z.
* and so on...
