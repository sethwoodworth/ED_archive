Young Tubers United

{{quote|lol, there's an old guy in that picture|some [[newfag]]}}
'''[[NAMBLA|Young Tubers United]]''' is a secretive consortium bent on spreading the message of [[Pedophilia|man-boy love]].  This [[YouTube]] pedoligarchy is run by Jesari's Dad, [[Irish282]], DJ [[Ytask]], and various unknown sick fucks. While their main goal is to bring back Jesari to [[YouTube]]; many argue that this group has ties to the [[CIA]], Mossad, and most likely The [[Jeff Gannon]] Charm School. Finally, strangely enough [[VK411]] is trying to save this pedo-troll united front here using [[Google]]: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvspgHwxUDM]. Which is clearly absurd, since [[Google]]'s attorneys aren't cool with [[pedo]]s. Nevertheless sadly enough, the future of [[YTU]] remains an unsolved mystery.

==History==

YoungTubersUnited was created as a response to [[Ytask]], and built by '''Jesari's DAD''' to ultimately cover-up his [[fail]]ures in protecting Jesari. While many believe YTU is a real organization, sadly it's nothing more than a front. The obvious truth is Young Tubers United is exclusively made to help [[pedophiles]] that can't log onto [[12chan]]. Currently, it is assumed the [[Ytask]], [[Irish282]], and possibly [http://www.youtube.com/UpDownMostly UpDownMolesty] are at risk of losing their [[YouTube]] channels and privileges due to [[vlog]]ging about 12 year old boys. [[Google]] and [[YouTube]] are beginning to move away from [[unrealistic expectations]] and see [[irish282|the big picture]]. More recently, UpDownMostly filed a couple [[DMCA|YMCA]]s that were linked with this article. Which again, is pointless. Regardless, here is Tim's response [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo45chGl2VY]. Then the best part [[MaskedAnalyst]] response [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT9uBhTLKak].

The situation erupted into a LOLcano when YouTube sent this:

<pre>
Hello Andrew,
We wanted to get in contact with you to let you know of the details 
regarding the status of your son's accounts, Jesari and YoungTubersUnited 
(both of which are connected to the same email address). Due to direct violations 
of our Terms of Use and Community Guidelines, both accounts (and all others associated 
to this email address) will remain suspended.

All users must agree to and abide by our Terms of Use and Community Guidelines 
when they register for a YouTube account. This includes providing accurate 
registration info and being over the age of 13. If a user makes any indication 
that he or she is under the age of 13, regardless of the age they have entered 
on their channel page, we are obligated to take action in order to ensure the 
safety and integrity of the YouTube community.

Inaccurate details were provided at the time of registration for the Jesari account. 
The age listed is 21, which is neither the age of you or your son Jesse, and the 
email address associated with this account is also one belonging to Jesse, who is underage. 
There are also comments made from the Jesari account clearly stating the user is underage
(ie. "I am twelve years old"), which is what brought these TOU violations to our attention.

You are certainly welcome to start a new account in your own name, 
listing your correct age and email address, which you are in control of 
(you can also use our privacy settings to conceal this information from 
public view on your channel, just so long as your correct date of birth is entered at signup). 
And, of course, you are welcome to upload content on behalf of your son 
which is in line with our Terms of Use and Community Guidelines 
to any new account which belongs to you.

We hope this helps to clarify the situation for both you and your son.

Thank you,
The YouTube Team

==Other Grown Men That Are In Favor Of 12-year-old Boys Being On YouTube==
*'''[[ DynaCatlovesme]]''' is one of the minor man/boy love crusaders on YouTube, and is rumored to be the long-lost bastard brother/cousin of [[Irish282]]. DynaCatLovesMe's sole achievement in life is that he has a cat, that supposedly [[bestiality|loves him]]. SPOILER: The cat loves you because you feed it.

*'''[http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=XsprouserX XsprouserX] and [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Pennymm Pennymm]''' are a couple of YouTube [[trekkies|Trekkie]] [[pedophile|chickenhawk]]s that like to run a tag team operation. When a child gets suspicious of one of them, the other one vouches for him, and makes the child feel ashamed of even asking why these grown men would want to get on Instant Messenger and [[Stickam]] with them. These two have also apparently gone to the [[Irish282]] School for Grooming Kiddies. They run a private group called the "Anti-Haters United", a mini-me version of the [[YouTube Vigilantes]], where they pretend to "help kids". Fortunately, enough information was compiled on these two wastes of flesh to put them away in [[buttsechs|federal prison for quite some time]]. For a short time, you can also visit them on their Stickam accounts [http://www.stickam.com/profile/mrnicegui here] and [http://www.stickam.com/profile/picard87 here].

*'''[http://www.youtube.com/user/AngryNotSoOldHippy NotSoOldHippy]''' recently posted a [[YouTube|JewToob]] pedo batsignal informing the rest of the [[Pedophile|chickenhawk]] [[NAMBLA|community]] that the "best [[cp|talent]] on YouTube" aka [[Gary_Coleman|Galipoka]] has returned.

ALL THE VIDEOS ARE DOWN!

==The story Tim and Jesse's Dad Andrew don't want you to know==

[[Ytask|DJ Dustin Gardener]] started his yt4dummies channel on November 27th, 2006 and it was the first draft, if you will, for [[Ytask|YTASK]]. A channel for video collaborations, and DJ wouldn't be DJ if there weren't [[13 year old boy|little boys]] involved. So what does he do? He asks boys to help him make shoutouts, infomercials whatever for yt4dummies. In his travels, he meets a little boy named Jesse (AKA Jesari), and he asks him to make a video about yt4dummies and tells him his plans for yt4dummies and possibly YTASK. The proof was the final piece of the puzzle that had [[Special:Listusers|everybody]] thinking, it's a video on the yt4dummies channel made by Jesse:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twn3YgqSzo0 This is the video.]

[[Image:Irish282 pic.jpg|thumb|right|Check the sweater on Irish, this was NOT shopped. Irish is wearing a sweater with [[User: The thing|Charles']] company name on it, including the "Z" in the end.]]

Consider [[NAMBLA|Jesse's dad's]] and [[Pedophile|Tim Updownmostly]]'s dirty little secret. Jesse made that video for [[Ytask|DJ]] on December 12th 2006. Now Jesses dad gets wind of DJ's plans for yt4dummies/YTASK and thinks: "Fuck, if my boy is going to be [[E-fame|famous]], I'LL be his manager. Anything DJ can do I can do better, and my little cashcow should be making money for ME." So what does he do? He starts Young Tubers United, also in December of 2006. 

In short, Jesse's Dad steals DJ's idea for a collaboration channel for kids on YouTube, and goes ahead with it. However, he isn't able to stop DJ from also going ahead with HIS plans and so [[Ytask|DJ]] starts his own channel, YTASK, on December 31th of 2006.

The thing is, DJ was better at harvesting little boys. He snatched away all the good talent (if you can call it that) right in front of Jesse's Dad's nose. YTASK became Young Tubers United's biggest competition. Jesse's Dad whines and bitches about that to a big YouTuber who is Jesse's biggest fan and admirer: Tim Updownmostly. "Boy oh Boy," Andrew (Jesse's Dad) says to Tim, "that DJ is becoming a pest, he snatches away all the good talent blablabla".

Tim comes up with a [[Fail|plan]] together with [[Irish282]]. Tim figures: Well a lot of things are kinda shady about YTASK, there are no parents involved, there are only shoutout videos... And DJ is only a 25 year old kid, I can [[pwn]] him off the tubes. So Tim helps Andrew by making all these videos "asking questions" and technically [[Pwnd|destroying]] any image YTASK previously had. End result: DJ is [[ruin]]ed.

But then the unimaginable happens: YOUNGTUBERS GETS FUCKING [[Banhammer|BANHAMMERED]] OFF THE TUBES!!!. [[zOMG|Sound the alarms!]] What happens next: Tim, Irish, big signs on 777, videos begging for Jesse's account back and Tim desperately trying to prove that [[Drama|the channel was in fact owned by Jesse's Dad.]] 

Now please note, YoungTubers/YTASK WAS a possible [[Jews|goldmine]], they were both talking to sponsors. Now during the whole YTASK fiasco, it was well known that DJ had an "inside connection" within the [[YouTube]] hierarchy (you can also read about that [[Ytask|here]]). [[Some argue]], this insider orchestrated the banhammering of Jesse as revenge for DJ. 

Also, Tim talked a LOT with DJ. They all [[NAMBLA|knew each other]]. On top of that Updownmostly also tells people that YoungTubers United is <i>better</i> than YTASK and ([[lulz]]ily enough) that it's run by a little boy named Jesse. That was going to be their big selling point: "run by a kid, for kids". In the end, it was their own propaganda that got Jesse whacked from YouTube.

==The Story [[Irish282]] Doesn't Want You To Know==

Now that Jesse has been offered his account back, and refused, there's now an entire movement out there to restore the account of somebody <i>who doesn't want to be restored</i>. Irish couldn't miss an opportunity like this. He left the [http://youngtubers.com youngtubers.com] site up, continued to collect the email addresses and geographic locations of children, all the while planning to construct <i>his own YouTube</i>, where he could have uninterrupted access to the kiddies at all times. He contracted [[Charles Dagley]](who has recently been discovered to be the adult behind LoganSperman2) to make the site. It's under construction at this moment. 

==The YTU/Boylove Connection==

[[Image:Nico_the_pedo.JPG|thumb|Nico loves the YoungTubers...[[srsly]]]]
[[Image:Nicos_shirt.JPG|thumb|Close-up of Nico's shirt: The international Boylove symbol]]

Recently it has been discovered that blatant Austrian pedophile [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=TobiranHorde TobiranHorde](AKA Nico) is a supporter of the "Restore Jesari" movement. Nico has favorited many videos of the YoungTubers, and even left a support message on their Snapvine account. Nico is a well known [[pedo|boylover]], and makes no secret of this, frequently making videos proudly wearing his BoyChat shirt. [[Irish282]] and [[LoganSperman2]] are currently in high gear damage-control mode to control the episode. They've unsubscribed Nico from the [[HelpTruth]] channel, and deleted his Snapvine message to the kiddies.
