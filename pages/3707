High Five Harrison
Also known as Advice Bunny.

Portrays the awesome friend figure who is both shocked and amazed at anything, no matter how socially unacceptable it cares to be, and of course, [[Epic Win|HIGH FIVEEE's]] you for it. 

He is also known to like bacon and dislikes cupcakes. He takes the form of Advice Bunny when he puts on bunny ears because he is [[furry|cool.]]

HA HA HE REALLY FAILS THERE. QUITE UNFUNNY INDEED.
