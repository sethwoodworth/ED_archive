'''Expansion Mansion''' is where [[Oldfag]] [[sickfuck]]s come to fulfill their [[buttsex|deepest]], [[emo|darkest]] sexual desires, and hopefully to die out so we don't have to be engrossed by their impossibly sick fetishes. In case you're wondering just what the fuck '' 'Expansion Mansion' '' means, it is an [[online]] community of discussion, videos and not to mention images based around [[pregnant|inflated]] women, because once your finished with your [[furry]] and [[BDSM]] porn fetishes, over-inflated, unproportional naked [[women]] are the way to go, aren't they?

The site is also known for being worse then [[Imagefap]]. If the website hasn't already taken [[slowpoke|10 minutes to load]], chances are its never going to fucking finish and your hard-on will most probably be killed. But I guess thats a good thing, isn't it? You wouldn't want your girlfriend walking in on you [[fap]]ping to pregnant ladies.

==Other Sickfuckery==
But it's not just pregnant ladies, oh no. This site takes sickfuckery to the extreme. It is a fucking treasure-trove of God-forsaken [[photoshop]]ped images that even [[Goatse]] himself would cringe in fear. Unfortunately due to the large distribution that [[Photoshop]] has gone through, any [[sickfuck]] can edit images. If you would kindly direct your attention to the image to the right, you can see just how bad this nefarious tripe is. 

But it doesn't stop there. The [[loser|users]] that upload these images also seem to be into [[fatass|fatties]], [[bestiality]], [[tranny|transgenders]], horribly botched [[boob]] jobs, and even inflated men. Even moreso, swollen and infected wounds may also be appealing to these degenerates. Lets pray we never have to come across this crap.

==Forums==
Why this site even has a set of forums is beyond me, but apparently it IS possible to have an intelligent discussion on this pathetically sick crap. These fucks can't even be placed in their own category. Despite there being an 18+ age requirement, the literary skills that the average user possesses most likely means the majority are [[13 year old boy]]s.

*'''Rules''': Surely enough, this is the place where [[moderators]] go to express their [[fail|virtually imaginable]] authority on the [[basement dweller]]s that conspire in this [[shit|toilet]] that is EM. Be sure to [[troll]] them because inflation fetish is [[serious business|fucking serious]].
*'''General Discussion''': The large epicenter of formidable and [[retarded|intelligent]] debate. Go here to discuss the 'gradual decline in the moral ethics that was once needed to fap to this shit'. 
*'''Gallery Discussion''': A great big [[circlejerk]] for low self-esteemed nerds who spend all day telling other people how their gallery of images fucking [[own]].
*'''Video Vault''': Fancy name for ExpansionTube. All the videos you and your friends could possibly wish for are uploaded in here. Where [[basement dwellers]] spent millions of lonely nights jerking it when they could be fucking an actual pregnant lady.
*'''Chat talk''': [[Crap]] related to Expansion Mansion's [[IRC]].
*'''Pregnancy Discussion''': [[PROTIP]]: Its your fucking fault you got pregnant. Deal with it.
*'''Pregnancy Pics''': Luckily for you, it does not contain any images of women giving birth.
*'''Pregnancy Vids''': Unluckily for you, it DOES contain ''videos'' of women giving birth.
*'''Natural Bellies''': For women who haven't gotten pregnant and aren't [[fat]], but still have fucked-up body shapes because [[God]] hates them.
*'''Weight Gain''': Unfortunately the most 'normal' of the forums. Chubby-chasers go here to discuss and most likely [[fap]] to overweight fatasses licking [[cake]] out of each others asses.
*'''Pretenders''': Where idiots argue over models who cheat to look like swollen tumours. The real question that should be asked is, why the fuck do models want to look like this?
*'''Stuffers''': Collection of discussion/images/videos of models taking in anything EXCEPT [[dick]], such as air, liquid, food or other reversed crap.
*'''The Boobies''': A spamhappy image collection of giant, oversized, rockhard titties from vacuous [[women]] who would gladly have these kind of [[weeaboos]] fapping to them.
*'''Booty Call''': If you like [[fatass|big butts]] and you cannot lie, you should go here, just to express your interest in them.
*'''Body''': Every other category of 'expansion porn' clusterfucked into one great section of [[sickfuck]]ery.
*'''Dudes Expanding''': Probably the most disgusting and nauseating of them all. Where the 5% of females that comprise the user base go in hopes of more [[Thomas Beatie]] wannabes, as well as dudes suffering from elephantitus.
*'''Anthropomorphism''': Might as well rename it 'FurAffinity 2: Electric Boogaloo'. Seriously, every single topic is about [[furries]], in particular [[Sonic]] furry porn. [[Blazesonic]] would fucking cream his pants if he saw this.
*'''Artists''': Where people go to [[unwarranted self importance|show off]] their [[autistic]] talent. Rather then photoshopping real images, these people draw them, which is even sadder.
*'''Authors''': Horrible [[fanon]] devoted to this horrible fetish. Some of the most disgusting stories you'll never want to bare your eyes upon. 
*'''Morphers''': The breeding ground for the photoshop-addicted [[asshole]]s that created the most twisted images. Seriously, this stuff is even worse then [[The Power 5]], I shit you not.
*'''Off Topic''': Despite it being the only [[sickfuck]]-free subforum, it is home to some of the most idiotic, nonsensical [[flame war|arguments]] that you could possibly find on the [[internet]]. This [[shit]] is even worse then [[fanboy]]s arguing over [[Goku Vs Superman]].

You guys should be sucking my cock. I had to register an account to research this horrible shit. Now every week I'm going to get a fucking newsletter about naked lesbian pregnant bitches fucking, and my mom checks my fucking email! Oh well, it was for the [[lulz]].

==Users==
There are certain users that deserve to be mentioned for contributing their horrible sickfuckery to the [[cancer]] that is killing the internet:

'''NexusT''': The [[asshole]] responsible for most of the images you see before you. This shitwipe needs to be [[b&]] from [[photoshop]] before he creates another puke-inducing disaster. This unwholesome user is the main contributor to the website and has somehow managed to rack up almost 100,000 views from his fanbase. 

'''Solo89''': ''Willy Wanka's Factory'' [[fantard]]. His gallery consists of images that have been pallet swapped so that every single pregnant and inflated girl appears with blue skin, much like that spoiled [[loli]] who ate that piece of chewing gum. He has [[no life|wasted his life]] creating more then 20 pages of these images.
