[[Image:ChristoryPogs.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A photographic history of Chris growing up,<br>...In the form of [[Pogs]].<br><br>''Christ, you couldn't make this shit up!!!'']]

Here at [[ED]], We've gotten a lot of entertainment from the likes of [[Chris-chan|Mr. Christian Weston Chandler]] since that chilly November morn in 2007, when the overweight man-child burst into our hearts like a rupturing [[autistic]] blood vessel. But despite his popularity here, a huge majority of the lulzy events that have kept us ROFLing over the years have only been recorded on the site from chat logs in the discussion page by the various newfags who think shouting JULLAYYY at him is still funny...UNTIL NOW!!!

The following "Christory" is an archive of the events that have played out in Chris' life since the creation of his article on Encylopedia Dramatica, both in and out of the wiki, starting off with the month following up to his "birth" on the Internet world stage.

Enjoy!

''(Note: Any date marked in blue indicates a video uploaded by Chris himself, all other videos from third parties effecting Chris personally are linked in the date's description themselves.)''
