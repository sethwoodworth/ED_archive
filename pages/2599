'''Edit''', also known as EDIT.COM, is the coolest text editor in the whole world. If you love [[IRC]]ing on the [[internets]] and [[You Don't Have Any Friends|have no friends]] [[IRL]], it's more than likely that you'll end up hearing [[lunix]] [[zealot]]s [[Cat fight|politely debating]] when trying to reach a reasoning about which is the best text editor in the world: vim or [[Emacs]]. What they don't know is that none of them is right, since '''Edit''' [[Shit nobody cares about|is more flexible, scalable and feature-rich than]] [[Emacs]], [[Unwarranted self-importance|more powerful and faster than vim and more user-friendly than nano.]]

EDIT IS EDITED *caps lock*

It is rumored that when the greatness of Edit is acknowledged through the whole world, [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Catholic]]s and Protestants, [[Israel|Israelis]], [[Palestine|Palestinians]], [[Republican]]s, [[Democrat]]s, [[Goons]], [[Furries]], [[Grammar Nazi]]s, [[AOL]]ers, [[Queer]]s and [[Texas|Texans]] will all hold hands and sing kumbayah in a big, [[hippy]] circle of joy and peace.
