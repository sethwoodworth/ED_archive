Here
'''Here''' is the place where you are. If you are not here, you are [[Special:Random|there]]. If you are not [[Special:Random|there]], you are [[pwned|dead]]. Here is a concept that implies a [[typo|concious]] entity placing itself somewhere within the real world. The concept of '''here''' has been perverted by people who use the [[internet]] and other [[drugs]]. They say "I'm on the internet" as though the internet was real.

;'''The [[Real World]].'''

;'''[[Earth]].'''
:Scientists and [[Capitalism|capitalists]] for years have been trying to prove that the earth doesn't exist, but they're dumbasses who edit at [[Wikipedia]]. The earth is real and alive. [[Rape|Respect]] [[liberal|her]]. Reduce, reuse, reboot! 

;'''On your [[Fat]] [[Ass]].'''
:Strangely enough, "on your fat ass" is most often where someone is when they think they are [[OTI]]. Both your fat ass and the Internet are full of crap and we think that there is a connection. Could also possibly be [[in the ass|''in'' your ass]].

;'''[[Your mom]].'''
:We've ALL been there, d00d.

;'''The [[Internets]].'''
: Ditto for the Information Super Highway, Cyberspace and Das Webbenstein.

;'''[[The Matrix]].'''
: Dude, if this were all a computer program designed to enslave my mind, then how come [[lolwut|I'm learning so much in school?]]

;'''The moon.'''
: Put down the reefer, man. It's puff-puff... GIVE-GIVE, [[plskthx]].

;'''[[America]].''' 
:  Overflowing with [[obese]] tubs of shit that [[capitalism|consume everything]] in their path as  they slowly rot from the inside out.

;'''Bat Country.'''
: You can't stop here.

;'''[[Your mom]].'''
: d00d, gay.
