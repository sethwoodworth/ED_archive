Meaningless noise
'''Meaningless noise''' is noise containing random non-informational semanticity components. In other words, it don't mean [[shit]]. Many [[post]]s on the [[internets]] are meaningless noise. These should be instantly challenged with "[[LOL WUT|What the fuck are you talking about?]]" Be warned that the author will defend himself with even more noise, as though additional meaninglessness will bring purpose and depth to his [[idiot]]ic blathering.

When engaged in a [[flame war]], it's fine to tell someone his fifty-page diatribe on economics is meaningless noise though it's better to just say it's [[bullshit]]. Make sure to make this reply quickly, so it's clear you [[TL;DR|didn't read any of it]]. Musicians also appreciate hearing their latest work of art is meaningless noise.

Meaningless noise is sometimes a [[troll]]ing tactic used to baffle a [[boring]] forum. [[Non sequitur]]s, scraps of [[Linkin Park|shit band]] lyrics, or a few dozen posts started so you can reply to yourself with random babbling are all excellent ways of gaining the [[attention]] of regular [[community]] members.

**"The curse is a long neglected [[Literature|literary device]], but one I believe should be revived and added to the pundit's arsenal. The floods of invective, tirade, rant and [[snark]] have grown stale and are losing their emotional power. They've become old and comfortable, viewed as reassurance to the supporter and meaningless noise to the opponent." --virge
