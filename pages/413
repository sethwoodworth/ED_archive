American language
{{quote|An atlantic crossing is long, to pass the time my family decided to ruin the english language on the mayflower.|[[Ouchies]]|on being an [[American]].}} 

A language invented purely by accident during world [[World War II]] when a shipment of the letter "u"'s from Britain to America was bombarded by Nazi missiles, hence the lack of the letter "u" in American words, such as: color. Because of the event, many Americans were enlightened so they started replacing "s"s with "z"s ("customise" -> customize). The change to "z" actually makes sense, though, since "s" and "z" are different sounds. The language is now for the most part replaced by [[shit nobody cares about|Esperanto]].
