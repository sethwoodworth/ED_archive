Being '''clever''' is the goal of many rising young stars on [[Internet]] [[forum]]s. However, nobody has ever achieved this goal. If someone calls you "clever," they are without a doubt being sarcastic. You are actually a [[stupid]] person, even more so if you're reading this.

Pursuit of cleverness will probably lead to [[trying|thinking]] too hard, which leads to [[drama remorse]].

**"If you aren't clever enough for a real moment of humour (perhaps an obscure reference to joyce dewitt's appearance on the family feud, or the harrowing tale of your eli wallach movie marathon with no coffee) try a silly hat. at least after you leave you'll get the smile and giggle you had hoped for."
