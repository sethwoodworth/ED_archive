Man The Harpoons
'''Man The Harpoons''', much like [[Facepalm]], is a versatile [[meme]] that can come into [[B|play]] in a variety of situations but is primarily utilized when a great big [[BBW|whale]] is sighted on the [[4chan|horizon]]. To put it simpler, use it when you see a fatass. Also see the [[#Secondary meaning|secondary meaning]] of this meme.

This meme is one that should be [[post|played]] quickly, because it can be neutralized by the [[in before X|"in before"]] ([[harpoons]]/[[TITS OR GTFO]]/[[gb2]])post.

Derivatives of this meme include replacing the word '''harpoon''' with something that would bring down complete [[ruin]] on the victim/poster. For example [[macros]] with lulz like: '''[[The Finnisher]] - For When The Harpoons Just Won't Cut It.'''

=== Secondary meaning ===
A "harpoon" can also refer to a call for an [[flood|onslaught]] of comments or other communication; in this case a call to Man The Harpoons might mean a call for [[Nigra|/b/lackup]] to make more comments on a news story or votes in an internet [[Poll's closed|poll]]. The image evoked is of a whale pierced by multiple harpoons and suffering, or&mdash;in the case of especially effective harpoons&mdash;one of those newfangled Norwegian explosive harpoons which knock out the whale with a single shot (ostensibly for humane kills, but mostly because exploding harpoons are cooler than just plain old harpoons).
