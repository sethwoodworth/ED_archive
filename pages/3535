'''''Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann''''' , or '''''Gurren Lagann''''', or '''''The Yoko Show''''' to the majority of its fans (who [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|lack the attention span]] to remember its full title when creating ED articles), is a shitty [[animu]] made by Gainax, who decided they had gone too long without making a show about [[penis|penises]] and anime chicks that take up most of the fanbase [[hentai|ad infinitum]].

The story centers around the [[Eva|typical emo kid]] main character Simon who finds a robot and proceeds to kill [[Furry|furfags]] with it, as the whole show basically consists of a bunch of explosions and yelling, along side his town's local [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] Kamina and the [[Overrated|iconic]] pair of [[Attention Whore|tits]] Yoko. The main character's robot has the ability to [[Hackers on steroids|hax]] all the other robots it comes in contact with, resulting in some ''Katamari Damacy''-like shit known as "GATTAI!!", or [[buttsex|"union"]]. Eventually a [[loli]] is introduced to the show, but its later revealed that she's a sleeper agent destined to cause the extinction of [[ppl|humanity]] when the main character makes a [[fail]]ed attempt to propose to her. Oops.

''Gurren Lagann'' is very popular with 4chan's /a/, so much so that /a/ has begun hating in much the same way it does ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''.

The only character that isn't entirely made of [[fail]] is a soldier for the [[furfag]] army, Viral. [[Weeaboos]] post [[over 9,000]] threads about Freehaven everyday in /a/ and /y/. Most of these are full of pictures of him taking it [[in the ass]]. Because everyone is [[gay]] for Sage. No exceptions.
[[Image: Viralfendingoffrape.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Viral ain't no prison bitch]]
But, to be fair, he fights with a bigass meat-cleaver-thing and beats up other furfags in [[prison]] showers. Later in the series he breaks out of prison with Simon and joins him in fighting the other furfags.

Other [[stuff]] that happens in the show includes:
* [[Grand Theft Auto|Robot hijacking]]
* Main character's [[brother]] making a robot work because he wants it to badly enough
* <s>Believing in me, who believes in you</s> BELIEVE IN [[YOU]], WHO BELIEVES IN [[Fag|YOURSELF]]!
* Running up ladders
* Giant robots with mouth parts that move when the pilot talks
* Shitty GAINAX ending
* The furfag leader getting out of his giant robot and [[Secks|fucking]] the hero's robot's [[shit]] up with his bare hands.
* [[Anonymous]] [[Retard|drooling]]
* The main character becoming a [[space]] [[pirate]] and going to [[war]] with the entire universe (in an alternate universe. LOL GAINAX.)
* A godly [[final boss]] with the power to freely [[Divide by zero|manipulate the fabric of reality]] and form a robot the size of a galaxy. In the final battle, it literally throws a Big Bang at the [[An Hero|heroes]]. Rather than use its powers to effortlessly [[Delete fucking everything|erase life from existence]], it insists on fighting humanity on equal grounds to make them despair themselves to death.
* Viral marketing
* Furry Holocaust
* Talking with a hole in your chest

'''A Short Plot Summary'''

<youtube>CCO3hTCRFYc</youtube>

''Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann'' is like 4chan, it's about a story of humans/tripfags fight against Han-Rasen/Anonymous. The story revolves around an entire race's discovery of the world, and then continues to take what they think was once their right from the furfags, and the tripfags succeed in taking the world using the power of tripcode.

However the furfags were trying to defend themselves and the tripfags from something much more sinister, that being Anonymous Legion. Anonymous wished to use Majora's Mask to crush the tripfags, however the tripfags ruined their ship and turned the moon into the biggest tripcode in existence. Using this they go to fight head on with Anonymous, [[fail|only to discover great despair]].

[[basement_dweller|Alternatively it could be seen as simply saying "go outside, retard".]] With a number of other meaningful messages about life that wee/a/boo managed to pull out of their arses to justify crying over fiction.

In reality, ''Gurren Lagann'' is simply an amalgamation of stolen ideas. In fact, it was executed much better back when it was called ''Evangelion'', ''Gundam'', ''Gao Gai Gar'', ''Final Fantasy X'' , ''Majora's Mask'', ''Star Wars Episode V'', ''House of M'', ''Independence Day'', ''Ideon'', ''Yamato'', ''FLCL'', ''Gunbuster'', ''Captain Harlock'', and ''CHiPs''.

===The Moral of the Story===
{{quote|The probability of success for this mission was 0%, but it seems theoretical calculations are meaningless when it comes to you guys. But really it's about Kamina fanboy worship and Yoko's hentai material, but mostly about Yoko tits.}}

All problems, no matter how inconceivably large, can be solved by wishing really, really hard. Through sheer willpower and making constipated faces, you can:

* annihilate an entire race of [[furries]] 
* repair and maintain giant robots from [[Aryan|a vastly superior civilization]] in middle of an endless wasteland
* advance from a race of illiterate, [[Arab|cave-dwelling]] people to futuristic levels of technology in 7 years
* break every law of practical and theoretical physics
* breath in space and underground
* instantaneously evolve from a rat to a human
* kill [[God]]

[[Image:LOLWUT2.jpg|thumb|[[weegee|Simon faces the final boss]].]]

* [[Eric Harris|Simon Ass Driller]] - The resident shota for much of the series, after a timeskip he becomes some kind of man whore who [[attention_whore|insists on saving everyone else]]. In nipland, "Simon" is pronounced [[semen|c-men]]. This is due to Simon being full blown gay. Before Kamina dies, Simon is about as useful as a string condom. Afterwards he becomes [[god]] or something and [[raep|raeps]] everyone with his drill.

* [[Original Poster|Kamina]] - Originally the town pedophile, he dies in episode eight. Many anons mourned his death as the loss of a supremely [[GAR|MANRY]] character. His key traits were his orange/red "stunna" sunglasses, extremely long sword and his "plzberapingmyarse" tattoos. [[SO cash|It has been proposed that his real name is John and he resides somewhere on the Jersey shore.]] Desperately wants a piece of Yoko's [[ass]], but dies before he can get some. After he dies, nearly everyone in Team Dai-Gurren begins [[Copypasta|using his catchphrases, mimicking his overly dramatic moves, and spray painting his glasses onto to everything]]
 
* [[Attention Whore|Yoko Ono]] - The epitome of [[jailbait]], this man-killing slut machine is apparently lv.55 in ''[[Call of Duty 4]]'' because she has a [[Penis|BARRET 50 CAL!!!! OMG!!!!1!11!1!]] and dropshots noobs with it while bunnyhopping boingy boingy 20 feet in the god damn air. She is frequently told by the other characters to SHUT HER WHORE MOUTH. Despite being a useless [[cunt]] she receives the most fan service out of any character in the series because her [[tits]] are often the most vital subject of the plot. Also, weeaboos and japs love kneesocks. Had a thing for Kamina, [[Fuck|but then he died]]. Had a thing for Kittan, [[Shit|but then he died.]] Her kisses kill people. Only reason [[you|fanboys]] watch this show. 
* [[Furry|Viral]] - A furfag masochist. [[fail|After getting completely destroyed in seconds]] by Gurren Lagann for the 17th time, he finally says FUCK IT ALL and teams up with Simon after the lolgainax timeskip. We all know that this is only due to Viral wanting to yiff with him. Lordgenome makes him immortal so he can tell stories about how he kicked Simon's ass, [[fail|but is immediately killed by Simon after he does it.]] 

* [[Bald|Lord Genome aka The Spiral King]] - Pronounced "LOR-juh-nome", for some stupid reason. He's [[over 9000]] years old. No, srsly, he actually is. Nia's father and ruler of the furries, don't worry though, he doesn't yiff. In fact, he uses the same method to create furfags to make himself a harem of delicious [[loli]]. At least he was smart enough to make sure that furfags couldn't breed. They reproduce by cloning or some shit. Somewhere along the line Simon [[fucked|drilled]] a hole in his chest, so now he's just a [[lol|head in a jar]].

* [[Awesome|Bruce Ironstaunch]] - Threw a rock at Rossiu and rose to minor internets stardom. [[truth|It is believed]] that Ironstaunch is the man who threw his shoe at another [[W|controversial political douchebag]] [[IRL]].

* [[Hitler|Tony "Rossiu" Stark]] - A religious fanboy Simon takes in out of pity. Becomes a bishonen. He later betrays his fuckbuddy in order to rule human civilization and imprison anyone who disagrees with him. Wants to be Lawful Good, but is just a plain douche. When he realizes what a douche he was, he tries to become [[an hero]], but is stopped by Simon, who invents teleportation ''specifically'' to punch him in the face. That's not a joke, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7jY-n2Dvng that actually happens]. He also tells him to grit his teeth, which is just asking for him to break his jaw. 

* [[loli|Nia Nymphatica McRapebait III]] - Lord Genome's loli daughter who grows up into Simon's worst nightmare. She was originally found [[Baby_Grace|packaged in a storage box]]. 

* [[EFG|Beamspam "Attenborough" McMuppet]] - Almost a mascot character due to his [[Smiley|quirky design]], Beamspam [[retard|likes to hits lots of pretty buttons]] and so as to [[IMMA_CHARGIN_MAH_LAZER|fire lasers]] and make things explode. 

* [[cats|Kittan]] - Yoko's second victim, Kittan was once a proud member of the KKK along with his three sisters, after meeting Kamina & co. he decided to ditch riding backwards dogs for a more comfortable, [[Dildo|banana-shaped mech]]. He is the replacement Kamina after Kamina dies, except twice as gay and not nearly as [[EPIC]]

* [[pig|Boota]] - Simon's [[BFF]] who turns into a [[shota]] at the end of the series, only to turn back into a pigmole again. Boota spends most of the series in Yoko's cleavage, on Kamina's lap (and in one instance, clamped onto his [[cawk]]) or inside Simon's arse. In one episode Kamina and Simon share in eating his arse out. No, srsly.

*[[Faggot|Leeron]] - A scientist you can only assume is male. Frequently equips his homo rapeface and frightens the little children with it for [[lulz]]. Prefers to be called "Beautiful Queen". His design is taken directly from Eureka of ''Eureka 7'', and is still just as [[Ugly|freaky]].

*[[shota|Gimmy]] - A little kid who runs around naked and [[fisting|shoves his finger up random people's assholes]].  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTYKKiT5Byw&feature=related| No, seriously.] The Japanese like kancho the same way we like dick jokes. 

*[[Weegee|Anti-Spiral King]] - The final boss. Anti-Spiral/Weegee enjoys raping young girls, causing despair and giving people LSD.

'''Episode 4 Drama'''


Episode four of the series was guest directed by Osamu Kobayashi, as a result everyone in the episode appeared constipated or as though they'd walked out of [[yaoi|some gay fancomic]]. The weeaboos on 2channel began to complain about this, and Takami Akai, one of the Gainaxfags that produced ''Gurren Lagann'' and a 2channel regular, saw their comments and responded that reading them was [[Eproctophilia|"like putting [his] face next to an anus and breathing deeply."]]

The weeaboos soon found out about how he felt about their constructive criticism and eventually Akai left Gainax because of teh butthurt. Hopefully he did it for the [[lulz]].

[[shit_nobody_cares_about|Though not particularly memorable to those outside of /a/]], there was a raid made on Takami Akai's blog entry. Anonymous defended the episode against the Japanese weeaboo who insisted it was blasphemy, this resulted in much short-lived lulz and Engrish.

'''Did Jew know?'''

* Every character that Yoko kisses dies in the same episode she kisses them in?

* Kamina died a [[virgin]]?

* Simon enjoyed [[secks|sexual relations]] [http://www.japanator.com/the-secrets-of-gurren-lagann-answered--6714.phtml| with Nia during their time together?]

* Viral has the same voice actor that does the [[orgasm|grunts]] for [[Legend of Zelda|Link]]?

=='''The UNITED Kingdom'''==


[[Image:GreatBritainBrigadeflag.gif|thumb|left]]


{{quote|The Norwegian designer, who wishes to remain [[Anonymous]], said he intended the flag to represent the union of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in a [[weeaboo|modern, cool light]].

The [[whut|dragon]] itself was inspired by a Japanese anime television series.

"It represents shouting "UNION!" and [[buttsex|joining together]]; kicking reason to the curb and doing the impossible; fighting the power, and piercing the heavens," he said

And what impact does he think the new flag would have on foreigners like himself?

"That the UK is awesome. I just hope they don't think it's a pirate flag.

"Actually, if this design is rejected as a common flag perhaps the Crown might file it for future use as a privateer ensign on the high seas or in outer space."|British newspaper ''The Telegraph'', [[YHBT|completely oblivious to Anonymous' control over the outcome]]l}}

=='''Huge Yaoi Fanbase'''==


Despite the blatantly [[fursecution|anti-fur]] message of the show (for the first half at least), this series is increasingly popular with all the [http://sroekakia.net great kitsoonay arteests] on the internets - and half the fangirl population of [[devianTART]]. A large number of [[16-year-old girls]] will claim to have watched every episode on [[YouTube]] and absolutely [[fangirl|love]] it!

==Rating==

* ''Action'': [[OVER 9,000]]. Seriously, it's fucking ridiculous.
* ''Lulz'': 7. Episode 4 alone caused massive drama and lulz galore. You also can't help but burst into tears laughing at how ridiculous the final episode's battle is.
* ''Gayness'': 3x^2. Tons of [[tits]], but Leeron wants to [[rape|pierce all the guy's heavens]], if you know what I mean. Fuckloads of phallic imagery.
* ''Furry Gayness'': -10. Whole show is a furry holocaust if you ignore that one faggot-y speech about [[bestiality|man and beast]]. Viral is below 40%.
* ''Fanservice '': 100%. 99 percent being about Yoko posing like whore on a big ass drill, or manly phallic machines and 1% every other unattractive whore that no one gives two shits about.
