Grog
[[Image:4qg5i_bbqgrog.jpg|thumb|[[BBQ]] GROG]]

Grog is an [[evil]] dipshit that has no comprehension of the line between [[trolling]] (the intentional aggravation and annoyance of those who cannot understand [[The Internet Is Serious Business]]) and pure malice. His entire purpose in life seems to be to cause human suffering. His "trolls" consist of him harassing random 11-15 year old kids and their parents until they cry and beg for him to stop. He does this by constantly sending [[Pig|police cars]], fire trucks, ambulances, taxis, food, [[porn]], [[prostitutes]] and other delivered goods to the person's family and also reporting them to the [[FBI]] on charges of child abuse. 

He is little more than an echo of the schoolyard bullying he received as a child. Trapped in an endless ''ko'', unable to escape the pattern of self, Grog gains only temporary shelter from his existential agony by the infliction of mental pain upon others. We hope this sad, pathetic husk of a human being will one day wake up and begin making amends for everything evil that he has done in his life. Sadly, little could possibly make up for the suffering that he has inflicted upon innocent human beings (most notably his parents who in an act of voluntary slavery pay for this retard's existence). In his next life Grog is destined to be a [[dog]] that gets sexually abused by [[furries]].

Grog was quickly and efficiently removed from [[Bantown]] by liberal application of the [[banhammer]]. [[jesuitx]] and [[weev]] are continuing active development on [[Grogv]], a bot that randomly spouts one of over 8000 statements collected from IRC logs featuring Grog. Eerily, you cannot tell the difference between it and the real Grog.
