[[File:Metokurp100.jpg|thumb|right|METOKUR's logo.]]
We've all heard about them: wannabe "trolls" incapable of trolling, who instead try to associate with trolls, in attempt at [[troll shielding]]. Such is the case with the [[Faust and Pory]] article. What started out as some [[User:Pory|cold-hearted bitch]] doxing some [[User:Prof Faust|poor sap]] that fell in e-love with her, quickly turned into a [[lollercaust]] as she soon found her own [[dox]] and [[pix]] added to said article, as well. In the beginning it was "[[I told you I was hardcore|ZOMG LOOKIT ME I'M SUCH A HXC TROLL I POSTED SOME GUIZE DOX THAT HANDED THEM 2 ME]]", but this quickly turned into "[[BAWWWWW|HOLY SHIT MY DOX ARE ON THERE TOO NAO! TAKE IT DOWN! TAKE IT DOWN!!!]][[111]]".

Fast forward now to the [[EDS1]] debaucle. During her hilarious fall from grace, certain wannabe trolls were once again offended that one of their own was, yet again, summarily trounced. Predictably, the [[Streisand Effect]] flung this drama further and faster then it ever would have gone, had it simply been allowed to blow over. In the course of events, as trolls smelled blood in the water, an article was created on METOKUR about [[EDS1]]. The resulting [[butthurt]] about <i>that</i> article (and the two main contributors to it) led to the creation of this one, [[WHY IS THERE AN ARTICLE?|an article about an irrelevant website with 5 active users]].

===Revenge 1.0===
Before coming up with the idea for writing this article, EDS1 and her cuddle crew sought out [[troll shielding]] from [[legi0n]] to help them exact their vengeance. At the time, legi0n was still under the stranglehold of [[Ickeriss69]]. Here you can hear the king of troll shielding [[whiteknight]]ing for [[Allychan]]:

==Background of the website==
METOKUR was hatched from the brain of a naïve [[13-year-old boy]] named John who played with his anime-loving [[nerd]] friends on [[Gaia Online]] and [[Newgrounds]].  Beyond that, METOKUR's genesis is the classic [[YouTube Commentaries]] troll club story.  Kids who desired [[e-fame]] saw the advantages of YouTube and went for the gold.  John changed his name to Habermann, put on a headset, and began making fun of YouTube videos.

{{squote|They have gone out of their way to distance themselves from other [[shit]] commentary channels, even going so far as to [[Trolls trolling trolls|force some of them to put an end to their faggotry]] in a series of videos they called "[[No|Commentator Control]]". An example of this was [http://metokur.blip.tv/file/3569476/ their involvement in shutting down a channel] shamelessly calling itself [[Raymond45154#Initial Trolling|MrRetsupurae]], who took [[Stalker|their love of Retsupurae a bit too far]]. They've also called out commentators such as [http://vimeo.com/11713293 Boomstick545 and RandomDCE] as being talentless hacks, to which [[Pussies|they did not take too kindly]]. Don't expect any collaborations with [[YouTube Nobodies|BigAl and the rest of the ranting gang]] any time in the near future.|How Habermann [[writing yourself into an article|described]] METOKUR on the YouTube Commentaries [[YouTube Commentaries|article]].}}

The next step for Habermann was to gather some other users together and make a private site with no actual YouTube videos to comment on.  There they could hold their covens in secret and be free from spies and enemies.  There they could try to metastasize and spread their ideals and products to other trolling clubs.

==Folks from METOKUR==
*'''Jew [[Habermann]]''' - Founder of the site and personality from [[ED IRC]].  He eventually got banned from ED because he dared to speak the truth, that [[EDS1]]'s [[GOTIS]] faggotry had reached critical mass proportions. The [[EDS1]] Fan Club kicked their [[whambulance]] into high gear to get him [[b&]]. Now the proprietor at METOKUR, he first [http://www.gaiaonline.com/profiles/352046/?_gaia_t_=718 started out on Gaia], and made shitty flash animations at [[Newgrounds]]. Ironically, [http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/searchposts/957380/ so did many of the people that started this article].

Although he identifies himself as a buck-toothed [[I go chop your dollar|chop yo dolla]] black person, he is actually a filthy [[kike]]. Lmte is also a member of the [[YouTube Yahweh Clan]] and an [[B&|ex]]-[[sysop]] on Encyclopedia Dramatica. [[EDS1]]'s cuddle crew got him banned by constantly crying to [[ED]] staff about him trolling [[weeaboo]]s, [[tartlet]]s, and other [[Assburger]]'s victims.

*'''[[Swearing|Game Fucking Fuck Fuck Fuck Fucking Fuck Fucker]]''' - That's the name he goes by - you can [http://gff.metokur.org/ check yourself]. Of course, METOKUR giggles when they think of a name with so many cusses.

==Their Victims==

As an attempt to show off their [[skillz]] at the trolling game, METOKUR constantly makes its visitors aware that they have “[[Bullshit|destroyed]]” their share of victims. Take note that it does not take much effort to troll these groups, if not the common victims of any troll. Also take note that most of the contributors to this article fit into one or more of the categories below. METOKUR's excellence must be noted, folks.

*[[Tartlets]]
*[[Weeaboo]]s
*[[Furfag]]s
*[[Camwhore]]s
*[[Neckbeard]]s
*[[Lolcow]]s
*[[Retro Video Game Kids]]

Oftentimes they are able to provoke much butthurt from they're targets. Here is but an example from a [[white knight]] of one of their targets.

{{clear}}

Various members of METOKUR have come to ED in the past, though the only notable ones are [[User:Habermann|Habermann]] and [[User:Lmte|Lmte]], since both of these people [[zomg|said some mean things on the internet]] to some of the authors of this article. Both were known for being faggots, but Lmte managed to become a [[sysop]] anyhow.  Both are [[disgraced|currently banned]].  Habermann noted in [[troll shielding|his last article]] prior to getting [[b&|the boot]] that [[ED_is_not#ED_is_Not_Your_Personal_Army|ED was a trolling organization]] because he thinks every group that discusses or associates with trolls ''must'' be a trolling organization.

Lmte made light of his own [[b&]] and [http://www.cafepress.com/BrunoOFFICIAL.461728268 started selling shirts commemorating the event]. Cuddle crew weeaboos not capable of understanding that [[YCTAT|you can't troll a troll]] thought [[USI|they had "made METOKUR upset"]].

===[[Portal:Trolls|Trolls Portal]]===

METOKUR's collective (and ultimately destructive) [[troll]] [[fetish]] manifested itself early on in the campaign to have a [[trolling]] [[ED:P|portal]] made to focus on articles about trolls and their acts.  The idea wasn't actually a bad one, and the portal has proven to be pretty good, but initially it seemed like it would be a rehashing of about [[DA Portal|4]]-[[Portal:Chans|6]] [[Portal:Memes|''other'']] [[Portal:YouTube|portals]], and some thought it was pointless, like the [[Portal:Music|Music Portal]].  Habermann did [[pussy|fuck-all to fight for it]], leaving it up to [[User:Dunecat|Dunecat]] to make a stronger case while he [[User:TrainOfThought/Garage|worked on the formatting and colors]].  The campaign was finally successful when some actual [[sysop|sysops]] agreed on having a portal occasionally exclusive to non-Tartlets and [[YouTube Nobodies]].  After it was created, Habermann went right to work [[Dramacunt|updating a little and bitching a lot]], while Dunecat quietly milled away and cleaned up 100-200+ articles about [[dox|doxing]], [[DDoS]] usage, [[power five|shock images]], and the like.  Hindsight is 20/20 and foresight is 20/400, so the hints of Lmte's and Habermann's [[USI|delusions of grandeur]] were totally overlooked during the initial discussions about the [[Portal:Trolls|trolling portal]].

===[[Lmte|LMTE]]-pedia===

Lmte and Habermann sprang from the same sick source, and it showed in the way they edited the [[ED|wiki]].  Lmte was a [[sysop]] and Habermann was a regular user, but they would cooperate occasionally on their articles. It became impossible to revert the edits they performed though, because [[mod sass|reverting a sysop is a no-no]] and Habermann's edits were intertwined with Lmte's. This wouldn't matter too much if their edits were actually ''good'', but the reality was that their edits often weren't.  They consisted of such things as lies, [[SSP|self-promotion]], and [[fiction|completely made-up stories of trolling]]. Oftentimes, they'd expand on stories of the actions of other trolls and [[fanfic|insert themselves in the stories]].

===[[ED Singers]]===
[[File:Lmte_and_habermann_banned.PNG|thumb|A METOKUR member on Lmte's and Habermann's ban.]]

The fateful turn came during the summer of 2010. Seasoned EDitors who watched this article turn into a giant puff piece posted on the [[Talk:ED_Singers#Circle_Jerk|ED Singers talk page]], which quickly spawned into a debate about whether or not the <s>three singing weebs</s> one singing weeb, with [[sock|multiple personality disorder]], was [[Cancer|bad for ED]].  The debate spread to [[ED IRC|irc]], mostly #wiki, where it proved to be very divisive.  Some people just wanted the thing to end and all parties to [[stfu|cool it]].  Some people wanted [[troll|bad things]] to happen to other people.  Some people just wanted everybody to [[Leave britney alone|LEAVE ALLYCHAN ALONE]].

{{quote|<%Habermann> I'm totally chill<br>
<%Habermann> You're offended because I don't like EDS<br>
<%Habermann> lol<br>
<%ShardDax> No, I'm offended because you're a limp-wristed Armchair EDitor<br>
<%Habermann> lol what<br>
<%Habermann> I run a portal bro<br>
<%Habermann> And edit tons of shit<br>
<%Thayo> He does too lol<br>
<%ShardDax> And yet you complain about something and say, "Meh, let someone else do it"<br>
<%Habermann> Stop tossing around wiki insults<br>
<%Habermann> Alright<br>
<%Habermann> Here's my fix for the EDS article<br>

<%Habermann> Or turn it into a two paragraph article<br>
<%Habermann> With the video gallery<br>
|[[User:Thayo/EDS IRC Drama|NO DEAL! We will worship Bellofatto as hard as we possibly can!]]}}

In fact, it wasn't even possible to make any real edits to the article at that point because EDS fans and enemies alike were [[edit warring]]. Furthermore, sysops were banning people who were making edits to the article.  Pretty much the only way to talk about the Singers was on IRC - where Habermann became a central figure in the fight and began to catch a lot of flak from various EDS1 fans.  He was feelin' the heat, so he decided to do the only thing he knew how - [[idiot|throw more gas on the fire]].  The ED Singers had released, around that time, a new shit song called "[[Tentacle Rape]]," which was supposed to be a parody of "Telephone" by [[Lady Gaga]]. Habermann had some underling (Sir Jimbo to be exact) at METOKUR churn out a [[YouTube Commentary]] of the video.  Habermann continued to add a complete section to [[EDS|the EDS article]] about the YouTube Commentary, claiming it was made by an ED member.  Pressed on the issue, he backtracked and admitted the truth: it was made by some peon at METOKUR.  

Some fat people knew it was all bullshit, but when ShardDax called Habermann out ''in the article'' for being useless, Lmte went and reverted his edit. [[ShardDax]] cried about Lmte and Habermann and was banned for 3 days because he had "reverted a sysop."  Angry, ShardDax got on [[ED IRC|IRC]] to [[asking for it|ask for an unban]].  His plan was to [[facepalm|call Lmte a faggot]], but such a brilliant plan was wrecked by an [[lol|extra 4 days being tacked on to his ban]].

===[[Faust and Pory]]===

The original article was written by [[writing yourself into an article|an actual party to the drama]], [[User:Pory|Pory]].  Lmte felt the need to improve the article by making it [[Fox News|fair and balanced]].  Even though the article was [[Exhibit B|pretty bad]] to begin with, being nothing more than an attack article about Faust, Lmte was able to drastically improve it by trolling the author into [[raging]] over it.  Pory and a new friend of hers went and reverted his edits, but Lmte was a sysop and had the upper hand, so Pory and her new friend savored their angst until they could vent their anger by writing this article.  He changed the article name and rewrote it to target Pory <b>and</b> Faust. No fair!

Originally, the article had included a link to Faust's dox.  The mods at the [[ED Forums]] were encouraged by this to find Pory's dox.  They're idiots, though, so they were totally incapable of doing so.  Lmte managed to find Pory's aunt's number, which he proceeded to call in search of dox.  He got the dox, and when Pory found out, she [[shat bricks]].  The irony of all that is that Pory had done the same thing to Faust, essentially.  Regarding Faust's dox, they had been taken down by a sysop more senior than Lmte (in part because the actual pastebin that contained the dox had been deleted).  A warning had been put in their place not to add any more dox.  Lmte was forced to quiet down with Pory's dox for a short time, but eventually managed to sneak them back in to the article.

===[[Troll Shielding]]===
In a strange way, [[Troll Shielding|this article]] would prophetically describe most of the initiators of this one.  After finally doxing [[EDS1]], Habermann created the Troll Shielding article in yet another attempt to paint himself as [[irony|the true troll menace]] and [[Chad Syphrett|the voice of ED]]. It never really occured to him that Lmte's support was the only thing that had kept him from getting thrown out of ED earlier, since the EDS1 cuddle crew had been conspiring against him for quite some time.  He let the irony build by working on the article, proclaiming himself king with no need of defenders.

The article discussed how some [[loser]]s, [[weeaboo]]s, [[furries]], et cetera would use [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] to [[truth|hide from the other trolls]], as if they would be allowed into the treefort and offered some kind of protection.  It also pointed out that "[[ED_is_not#ED_is_Not_Your_Personal_Army|ED is not your personal army]]," in contrast to the METOKUR gang's desire for ED to be just that - their personal army.  The article became pretty much universally contested among those who were actively seeking troll shielding, and many tears were shed over it.  Lmte used his sysop status to revert a lot of the same kind of faggotry in that article that can be seen all over this one.
