Baroness Warsi
[[File:BaronessWarsi.jpg|thumb|350px|right|]]
Baroness Sadaama [[Saddam Hussein|Hussain]] Warsi, Sheriff of Dewsbury, professional [[Pakistan]]i and Chairman of “[[David Cameron|Dave]]"’s New Conservative Party, is the sort of ghastly patronising [[Asian]] woman of a certain age that makes Jewish and [[Italian]] mothers look [[Megan Meier|relaxed]]. First female terrorist to be allowed to stand as an MP for the [[Conservative]] Party, she moulded her image from that of podgy [[Islam]]ic housewife to stroppy [[Yorkshire]] mill owner so successfully that David “Dave” Cameron was able to dispatch huge swatches of the [[UK|country]] to [[Nazi|BNP]] control without even trying. “My father's success led me to adopting Conservative principles”, she explains, although it’s doubtful that her father played on his novelty value as an Asian woman to [[republican|screw lots of money out of poor people]].

==There’s no [[arse]] in Warsi==

What are Warsi’s beliefs? Some are directly in line with Islamic teaching.

*Some of her 2005 campaign leaflets claimed that Labour's lowering of the [[homosexual]] age of consent from 18 to 16 (under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000) was "allowing [[loli|schoolchildren]] to be propositioned for homosexual relationships", and that homosexuality was being [[fox|peddled]] to children as young as seven in schools. On being asked about this after she’s become famous she said “[[Jesus]]! Did I really say that? I was on [[crack]] at the time and I now believe that there should be no sex education on schools of any sort, especially for girls.”

*She went on record saying that [[racist|people who back the British National Party (BNP)]], may even have a point. "They have some very [[hate|legitimate views]]. People who say 'we are concerned about [[crime]] and justice in our communities – we are concerned about [[black|immigration]] in our communities'". On being challenged on this [[Nick Griffin]], BNP Leader, said “At first I was pleased. I’d assumed that since Saddama was from West Yorkshire she merely had overdone it at the tanning salon and was a genuine [[white|Aryan]] at the core.”

*On 30 November 2009 she was pelted with [[egg]]s by a group of [[Muslim]]s whilst on a walkabout in Luton; the protesters accused her of not being a proper Muslim and of supporting the death of Muslims in [[Afghanistan]]. Baroness Warsi told the [[BBC]] that the men were "idiots who did not understand a value of eggs at the time when the Conservatives are driving the country into a double dip recession.”

*When a Tory MP tried to ban [[women]] from wearing burkas in public in 2010, she said that wearing a burka does not limit women from engaging in everyday life. “Limiting women from engaging in everyday life is the job of every good Muslim husband, burka or no burka,” she smirked.

*In September 2010 during the visit of [[Pope]] Benedict XVI to [[England]] and [[Scotland]], Baroness Warsi said the [[work|Labour]] government appeared to have viewed religion as "essentially a rather quaint relic of our pre-industrial history. They were also too suspicious of faith's potential for contributing to society - behind every faith-based charity, they sensed the whiff of conversion and exclusivity," she said. "And because of these prejudices they didn't create policies to unleash the positive power of faith in our society.” She then attempted to blow up the Pope in retaliation for the Fourth Crusade using a home-made suicide vest that failed to work properly.

*In October 2010, she explained electoral fraud in Asian constituencies by saying that the people concerned had learned cheating in [[Pakistan]] and it was part of “Dave’s” ‘[[lie|Big Multinational Society]]’ which encouraged amateurs to run the government and all associated services however they felt like.

==Warsi’s future==

The betting odds at [[gambling|Ladbroke]]’s as of October 2010 are as follows;

Burnt to death in the kitchen 10/1<br>
Sacked for being a moron 20/1<br>
First female Asian Conservative Prime Minister 10000/1<br>
Drowned by her own body oil 3/1<br>
