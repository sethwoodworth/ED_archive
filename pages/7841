Stoned
[[Image:stoners.jpg|thumb|Contrary to [[popular belief]], stoners have a place in society.]]
To be '''stoned''' is to smoke or eat [[weed]], and then [[MONGO|mong]] [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mong+out out]. In the [[Christian]] sense, it is to literally throw large rocks at [[faggots]] and [[Jews]] so they can [[What|repent and go to heaven]]. There is often [[OL]] debate about whether the [[US]] should legalize marijuana use and, if so, what kind of use should be legal. Arguments are sometimes cut short when pro-legalization advocates nod off in the middle of making a point.

Since marijuana has been a popular recreational drug since the dawn of time, there are many slang terms for it: chronic, maryjane, dope, weed, and flush-that-the-feds-are-at-the-door.

Marijuana grants its users extraordinary abilities, which is part of its attraction. While stoned, users can:
* Watch cartoons all weekend without once moving from the sofa
* Resolve any mystery of [[philosophy]] while giggling
* Eat more Twinkies and Doritos than was thought humanly possible
