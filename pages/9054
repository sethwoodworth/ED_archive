Some interesting, odd, or down-right nasty facts that Wikipedia's editors seem to think important enough to share with the rest of the world.

It's nice that Wikipedia actually has an article about titty fucking, but what is even nicer is the fact that they have a spoken article file on the page, so that you can listen to some creepy grease-ball smugly tell you about humping some girl's chest.

[[Image:Towgreatesthitsmilk.png|thumb|Semen contains trace quantities of dopamine, consuming gallons of the stuff will get you high.]]

* Antidepressant: Semen has been proven to act as a strong antidepressant in women. [http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/annotate/node/350] Women physically exposed to semen are less likely to suffer from depression. It is thought that the psychological effects of semen are a result of its complex chemical make-up, including several mood-altering hormones (testosterone, oestrogen, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin and several different prostaglandins, epinephrine, dopamine, oxytocin and serotonin). Because of these properties it has been called "Nature's Prozac".[http://dir.salon.com/story/sex/feature/2002/06/19/semen/index.html] The effect of semen on a male sexual partner (a receiver of semen) is not known.[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200210/crying-over-spilled-semen][http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2457][http://www.springerlink.com/content/wrkl9lc5ueu43rh8] These studies involved vaginal sex without condoms, however, the gastrointestinal tract is much more conducive to facilitate nutrient absorption than either the vagina or the rectum.[http://books.google.com/books?id=Jwx-10FmsBUC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=vaginal+absorption+of+nutrients&source=bl&ots=dPj5dFD5Kq&sig=22xrqUAaJe-y9mEYmybJSIwKPvo&hl=en&ei=Zwk5Su7oDsvBtwfSy_jeDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1]

[[Image:Towgreatesthitsslut.png|thumb|Just in case you forgot what to call your girlfriend, Wikipedia has a list for you.]]

* Men generally prefer that their semen be swallowed rather than spit out because it provides a feeling of acceptance. Also, continuing to suck through the [[orgasm]] leaves him both physically and emotionally satisfied.[http://www.scribd.com/doc/17417011/5-Reasons-to-Swallow-Your-Mans-Semen][http://www.themanschoice.com/Semenex.html]

* Several tribes of Papua New Guinea (including the Baruya, Etoro, Gebusi, Kaluli, and Sambia) believe that semen provides sexual maturation among the younger men of their tribe. To them, sperm possesses the manly nature of the tribal elders, and in order to pass down their authority and powers, younger men of their next generation must eat/drink their elders' semen. This fellatio and seminophagia custom commences among prepubescent males and postpubescents.[http://www.gettingit.com/article/56]

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukkake Bukkake]==

* Some feminists have described bukkake as a sexual fetish culture somehow "beyond sex". Others describe bukkake as symbolic group rape, with its primary purpose as the humiliation, degradation and sexual objectification of women,[http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/pdfplus/10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.25] and that the use of ejaculation is part of a humiliation ritual and generally does not involve any of the female characters experiencing orgasm.[http://books.google.com/books?id=tpiyGxq92RwC&dq=Sperm+Counts:+Overcome+by+Man%27s+Most+Precious+Fluid&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=NR_KqeW4hq&sig=UXY6HxT0Wei3ZEeCYZd2H29JWtU&hl=en&ei=LCySSZfdJoi6NM-Z2YkM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result] However according to the Village Voice, "The porn phenomenon known as bukkake shoots homophobia and misogyny '''right in the face"'''.

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felching Felching]==

* '''Felching''' is a sexual practice involving the licking or sucking of another person's anus. This practice involves a high health risk. In particular, it refers to the act of sucking semen out of the anus of one's partner. The semen has been ejaculated into the rectum via anal sex. The act of sucking the semen and then passing it, through mouth-to-mouth or open-mouth kissing, is often referred to as "Snowballing"; although the latter is typically associated with semen ejaculated into a mouth from fellatio.  

* '''''Felching may also refer to the anal insertion of a small animal (usually a gerbil) for the purpose of sexual stimulation.''''' [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00316740?query_type=advsearch&queryword=felch&first=1&max_to_show=10&search_spec=simple%3Afulltext&order=ab&return_set=entries&sort_type=alpha&result_place=2&control_no=00316740&search_id=4fMp-cA0Ha3-3019&side=M]

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearly_penile_papules Pearly Penile Papules]==

[[Image:Towgreatesthitsribs.jpg|thumb|Ribbed...for her pleasure.]]

* '''Hirsuties papillaris genitalis''' (more commonly referred to as '''pearly penile papules''', or '''PPP''') is a clinical skin condition of the penis. It is a harmless anatomical variation with no malignant potential, although it can be mistaken for genital warts by inexperienced doctors. The papules appear as one or several rows of small, flesh-colored, smooth, dome-topped bumps situated circumferentially around the corona or sulcus of the glans penis. Pearly penile papules are not a sexually transmitted disease and are in fact quite common.

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creampie_%28sexual_act%29 Creampie]==

* Cumfart: Refers to farting (or squeezing) the semen out of the anus or vagina. Examples include "Blow it Out Your Ass" by Elegant Angel, which focuses on milk enemas and anal creampies. [http://www.xbiz.com/articles/82856]

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_ejaculation Female ejaculation]==

* There are innuendos alluding to female ejaculation in books of the Bible. Biblical scholars attest to the fact that there are erotic references to lovemaking techniques in the Bible, and that includes female arousal, orgasm and ejaculation. One example is the Song of Solomon, in which three verses might be understood as references to female ejaculation (4:11-12, 4:14-15, 5:1). One of these reads:

{{squote|A garden enclosed is my beloved, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain ready to burst.|(Song of Solomon 4:12)}}

* Critics of the concept have maintained that ejaculation is merely either '''''stress incontinence''''' or vaginal lubrication. Research in this area has concentrated almost exclusively on attempts to prove that it is not urine...early work was contradictory, for instance the initial study on one woman by Addiego and colleagues reported in 1981, could not be confirmed in a subsequent study on eleven women in 1983, but were confirmed in another seven women in 1984. But in 1985 a different group studied 27 women, and '''''found only urine''''', suggesting that results depend critically on the methods used.

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frot Frot]==

[[Image:Towgreatesthitsfrot.jpg|thumb|Frot is fraught with problems...]]

* For their part, some gay men who defend the essential validity of anal sex rejected most of the claims above, and have at times '''''disparaged frottage as a makeshift, second-rate form of male/male intimacy â€” something better left to inexperienced teenagers and "closeted" older men.''''' In addition, gay men who enjoy anal sex argue that gay men who dislike anal still have an obligation to defend the practice against purely homophobic attacks, especially so long as sodomy laws continue to be enforced in many countries.

* However, the concept of frot did not come into existence until very recently, when Bill Weintraub coined the term frot in 2000 in his article, "Frot: The Next Sexual Revolution", which calls on gay men to adopt frot sexuality and reject the "'''''cultural deathgrip'''''" of anal sexuality.

* Among bonobos, frot frequently occurs when two males hang from a tree limb and engage in '''''penis fencing'''''. Frot also occurs while two males are in missionary position. A special form of frot called "rump rubbing" in which males stand back to back on all fours and rub their genito-anal regions together.

* Frot-like genital rubbing between non-human males has been observed among bull manatees, in conjunction with "kissing". Bottlenose dolphins have been observed rubbing their genitals against the genital area of other males often leading to the penetration of the genital slit, or less commonly the anus. Other forms of frot are also common among homosexually active mammals.  <small>--EDiot's Note: Who is paying for this research???</small>

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis_fencing Penis fencing]==

*Penis fencing is a mating behavior engaged in by certain species of flatworm, such as ''Pseudobiceros hancockanus''. Species which engage in the practice are hermaphroditic, possessing both eggs and sperm-producing testes. The species "fence" using two-headed dagger-like penises which are pointed, and white in color. The "winner" is the organism that inseminates the other. The sperm is absorbed through pores in the skin, causing fertilization in the "loser".

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia Zoophilia]==

[[Image:Towgreatesthitshorsefuck.JPG|thumb|If you have sex with animals, it is rape...unless you perform cunnilingus.]]

* The '''Humane Society of the United States''' has said that as animals don't have the same capacity for thinking as humans, they are unable to give full consent. In his 1993 article, Dr. Frank Ascione stated that "bestiality may be considered abusive even in cases when physical harm to an animal does not occur." This is because animals are unable to be fully informed, communicate consent, or to speak out about their abuse. In a 1997 article, Piers Beirne, Professor of Criminology at the University of Southern Maine, points out that "for genuine consent to sexual relations to be present...both participants must be conscious, fully informed and positive in their desires." Miltski believes that "Animals are capable of sexual consent - and even initiation - in their own way." It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with ("hump") the legs of people of both genders. Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes that '''''as far as cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training''''', and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively.

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapex#Rape-aXe Rapex/Rape-aXe]==

[[Image:Rapex.jpg|thumb|To prevent rape, perhaps you should force your dog to wear one of these.]]

* The Rape-aXe is a latex sheath embedded with shafts of sharp, inward-facing barbs that would be worn by a woman in her vagina like a tampon. If an attacker were to attempt vaginal rape, his penis would enter the latex sheath and be snagged by the barbs, causing the attacker excruciating pain during withdrawal and (ideally) giving the victim time to escape. The condom would remain attached to the attacker's body when he withdrew and could only be removed surgically, which would alert hospital staff and police. This device could assist in the identification and prosecution of rapists. Like most condoms, Rape-aXe also usually prevents pregnancy and the transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Rape-aXe was unveiled on August 31, 2005 in South Africa. Mass production was scheduled to begin in April 2007.

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soggy_biscuit Soggy Biscuit]==

* Soggy biscuit is a purported male masturbation game in which the participants stand around a biscuit masturbating until ejaculating on to it; the last person to do so must eat the biscuit. The game is also known in Australia as "soggy sao" after the SAO brand of biscuits popular there. The term "soggy biscuit" is thought to have originated in Australia sometime in the 1960s. Although the terminology may differ slightly, the notability of the game is such that variations on the theme are referred to in popular culture. The band Limp Bizkit is believed to have derived their name from an alternate title of the same game.

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_punch Donkey Punch]==

[[Image:Towgreatesthitsdonkeypunch.jpg|thumb|Which is funnier? The actual image, or the fact that it is displayed on Wikipedia?]]

* Donkey punch is a slang term for an apocryphal and potentially '''lethal''' sexual practice supposedly performed during anal sex. The purported practice involves the penetrating partner punching the receiving partner in the back of the head or neck (what is known in boxing as a rabbit punch, after a technique to kill rabbits) allegedly causing the receiving partner's anal passage to tense up and increase the pleasure of the penetrating partner. When used, the donkey punch is almost exclusively executed during or just before the orgasm of the penetrating partner.

* There is some controversy concerning whether the initial sexual act is restricted to anal sex prior to the donkey punch, or whether muscular contraction after the blow to the back of the head or neck during vaginal sex can also qualify as a donkey punch. It has even been proposed that a possible use of the donkey punch is to create a situation in which there can be a "surprise anal penetration" tantamount to sexual assault or rape.

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_ejaculation Delayed Ejaculation]==

* Therapy usually involves homework assignments and exercises intended to help a man get used to having orgasms through insertional intercourse, either vaginal, anal or oral, i.e. through the way he is not accustomed to. Commonly the couple is advised to go through three stages.[3] At the first stage a man masturbates in the presence of his partner. Sometimes this is not an easy matter as a man might be used to having orgasms alone. After a man learns to ejaculate in the presence of his partner, the couple gets to another stage where the man's hand is replaced with the hand of his partner. Step by step a man learns to ejaculate closer and closer to the desired orifice. In the final stage the receptive partner inserts the insertive partner's penis into the partner's vagina, anus or mouth as soon as the ejaculation is felt to be imminent. Thus a man gradually learns to ejaculate inside the desired orifice.

[[Image:Phonesex2.png|thumb|The favorite activity of many ronery wikipedo]]
* In May 2008, the U.S.-based social conservative site WorldNetDaily reported the cover image on Wikipedia to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. An officer of the [[Concerned Women]] for America, a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented, "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and pedophilia." EContent magazine subsequently reported the Wikipedia community's internal debate as concluding, "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed", and asserted that Wikipedia contributors "favor inclusion in all but the most extreme cases". In December 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a U.K.-based non-government organization, added the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer to its internet blacklist due to concerns over legality of the image, which had been assessed as the lowest level of legal concern: "erotic posing with no sexual activity". As a result, people using many major U.K. ISPs were blocked from viewing the entire article by the Cleanfeed system, and a large part of the U.K. was blocked from editing Wikipedia due to the means of blocking in use.

* Obviously phone sex is something the [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] male [[virgin]] wikipedo population is quite familiar with.

==Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisco Crisco]==

* Historical battle re-enactors sometimes use Crisco as a lubricating agent for musket balls, to retard the effects of black powder residue. It is also frequently used '''as a personal lubricant, especially for [[fisting]], particularly amongst the [[gay]], [[BDSM]] and leather communities.'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crisco&diff=prev&oldid=329608688]
