With [[television]] ratings in the crapper, advertisers are currently [[trying too hard|hard at work]] trying to [[viral]]ly market their shit products with [[forced meme]]s tied in to dedicated websites in the hope that the likes of /[[b]]/ will pick-up on such [[The King|wacky 'characters']] and spread them [[IRL]] like morons did the Budweisser '''Wassup!!!''' commercial:

The old [[Wendy]]'s gem ''Where's the beef?'' was used by Reagan to tow the mindless television zombies into voting for him.

A [[1990s|90s]] favorite, the "[[MEGAMILK|Got Milk?]]" commercials have spun off the most imitations.

Some are actually lulzy and cross over into [[Internets]] meme-dom, but most [[FAIL IT]] hard. Also, since /b/tards are either broke or cheap fucks, the likelihood of these forced TV memes turning into [[Jew golds]] is slim to none.
