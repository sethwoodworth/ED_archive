{{youtube2|AnonymousThought|AnonymousThought}} is a JewTuber and pretentious [[newfag]] from Clearwater that thinks it's a good idea to project Anon as [[KKK|a knight in shining armor on a white horse]].

== The Mission ==

About the only thing of value about this [[Anonymous Borg|borgfag's]] video is the production values as in his attempt to win new demonstrators for [[Project Chanology]] he both humanizes and belittles Anon by denying everything that Anon has [[ruin|built up]] and stood for while severely [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|breaking rules 1 and 2]]. The video is essentially an overly [[unwarranted self importance|didactic]] diatribe from some [[trying too hard|overzealous]] dbag who claims he is not speaking for or on behalf of anyone and that he is a neutral party, yet [[Irony|he makes a YouTube video informing others what Anon is or is not about]]. [[no|But hey after all srs business is more important than lulz, amirite?]]
