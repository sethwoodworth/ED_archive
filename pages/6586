'''Pregnancy''' is a common and disgusting [[STD|sexually transmitted disease]]. Pregnancy is transmitted via [[straight|heterosexual]] secks - often [[pervert|in the missionary position for the purposes of procreation]]. This deviant behavior has [[ruin]]ed many lives while bringing forth billions of already-ruined lives onto this God-forsaken planet. [[gay|Normal]] people are not at risk for this STD and therefore lead longer, more productive, and wealthier lives. Also, cocks.

The dormant stage lasts nine months, until the disease progresses to [[AIDS|full blown]] parenthood. At this stage, [[pwned|the father]] also contracts the disease. [[Prime radiant|Some people]] are pregnant for 15 months.

== [[Victim]]s ==
Most [[16 year old girls]] on [[livejournal]] [[I accidentally X|accidentally]] after a bad [[Lesbian Break-Up|breakup]] that was obviously their fault, or they just feel that they haven't gotten enough [[attention]] in the last fifteen minutes.

[[Sheneequa]]s also contract this disease at least twice between the ages of 13 and 17, usually due to whoring on the street so her 5-8 kids don't starve when "daddy" blows the welfare check on booze, crack and lottery tickets but his article will focus on stupid white chicks from [[livejournal]] and/or [[MySpace]]. For knocked up teen black chicks, see [[Sheneequa]].

Some men feel that pregnancy is [[pregnophile|the most attractive STD]], with pregnant women giving off a "[[oil|glow]]", even though [[baby|the next stage is permanent]], and will leave the woman [[fat|undesirable]].

The youngest girl ever to get pregnant and have a child was 5. She was in <s>Alabama</s> Brazil. She was <s>[[Rape|raped]]</s> [[Asking_for_it|asking for it]]. She liked it.

== [[ruination|Outcome]] ==

The prognoses for pregnancy follows:
# [[how is babby formed|Full term]]
# [[Suicide]] ([[death]] x [[dead baby|2]])
# [[Abortion]]
# [[Miscarriage]]
# [[Falcon punch]]

[[Image:Falcon_punch.jpg|thumb|The classic [[Falcon Punch]] actually solves teen pregnancy!]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Putnam Seth Putnam]'s [[fail|famous]] song ''You're Pregnant So I Kicked You In the Stomach'' deals with the falcon punch in a sensitive, compassionate ballad.

== Faking it ==
Most of them, as you may imagine, are [[lie|faking it]], either to garner [[drama|sympathy]], [[attention]], or both.  Their "dire announcement" will often be preceeded by several cryptic posts on their [[blog]], sparking the influx  of attention that most of them wish to receive.

You would think that since pregnancy is a somewhat apparent thing after a while, these girls would get caught in a lie, but it's all part of their evil plan - after a few weeks, they tragically have a [[abortion|miscarriage]] (i.e. [[Phaedriel]]), losing the pregnancy (oh well!) and reigniting the deluge of [[drama|sympathy]] from their clueless fanbases.  Most of these girls are [[camwhores]] and [[Thinspiration|internet models]], [[underage]] and aren't going anywhere anyhow, so the bright side is that, well, at least they're not ACTUALLY pregnant and won't give birth to [[bi-curious]] [[emo]] kids.

Underage (4-17) mothers can cause drama in several contexts:
*[[Childfree]] people love to whine and complain about how all the other girls in their town got pregnant at 13 and everyone gave them free cars because of it, while they themselves had to work eighty-hour weeks to put themselves through college as astrophysicists.
*[[Pop parenting|Pop parents]] enjoy being judgmental about teen mothers, unless those mothers are performing all their actions in accordance with the Crunchy Parenting Code of Conduct, in which case they're totally cool and mature.
*Regular parenting boards sometimes suffer teen mother invasions, which results in a bunch of fairly normal women with little [[internets]] experience trying to deal with demands of tolerance from bitter high-school students with bad spelling.
*[[Libertarian]]s like to include teen mothers in the wide and wonderful realm of welfare wank.
*Occasionally, semi-celebrities like [[Jamie Lynn Spears]] or Keisha Castle-Hughes get pregnant before they can vote, which invariably causes eruptions of drama between people who omg loooooove the actress in question and will totally support her no matter what she does, and the people who think maybe teen pregnancy is a bad idea even if you do have millions of dollars at your disposal.
*Invoking the wrath of decent people who work for a living.

== Preventing Pregnancy ==
[[Image:VictorianPostcard.jpgâ€Ž|thumb|Another way to prevent pregnancy is to beat the stork with an umbrella.]]
There are actually [[over 9000]] ways to prevent pregnancy (and only two ways to actually get pregnant, one of which involves doctors asking if you're sure you're stupid enough to do this), but [[over 9000]] [[16 year old girls]] per year get pregnant by [[I accidentally X|accident]]. Most are named [[Sheneequa]].

[[DO NOT WANT|Men can also exercise prevention]]. Although [[fail|these methods do not actually prevent]] pregnancy, they have been known to [[holocaust|systematically destroy]] a person's [[sex]] drive. Unless of course you are a [[sick fuck]].
