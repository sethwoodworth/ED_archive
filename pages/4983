Louisiana

A state located in the southern half of the [[US]], Louisiana was once considered to be a mighty civilization populated by [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] residents. After being discovered in 1994, Louisiana was inducted as a formal US state, making Louisiana the 51st state of America (after [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Sweden]]).

==History==
[[Image:Lousianaresident.jpg|thumb|A ''typical''  Louisiana resident]]
Louisiana was founded by the late president Jean-Louis Rapeyourmamma. Early Louisiana was a marine-based civilization that flourished below water until on [[9/11]] an [[oil]] spill forced the colonies to be constructed on the surrounding tropical swampland. For transportation the Louisianans rode alligators, and for food they were supplied Ramen noodles by [[France]]. To this day, half of Louisiana residents speak [[French]] and mate with alligators named Thibodeaux to sustain their species. 
The State first came about as dickweed Frenchmen (Frogs) were exiled to the region by the English who could no longer stand the smell of the Snails they were eating. They soon realized that they would have to survive on their own. In the beginning after realizing there were not enough snails to eat they began to eat things most humans would not, such as crawfish, putrid soups made from boiling socks, and feces (Roux) known as "Gumbo". They had nothing else to mate with (besides the gators) so in turn began to interbreed with their sisters. Only 4 males were exiled for their crimes of snail eating; Jacques Fontenot, Jacques Guillory, Jacques Guidry, and Jacques Fusilier. Everyone in the state now has only these four last names. The inbreeding can be seen as you drive through the majestic trailer park dotted countryside, and witness the "Cajuns" in their favorite pastime of accordion playing and masturbation. A recent attempt by congress to return Louisiana to France was passed by an overwhelming vote, but backfired when the French president told the USA "Fuck off, I don't want those bastards back!"

Today the state is credited with the invention of [[black people|black "people"]] and [[jazz]]. Uncle Ben is the current state governor and oversees the exportation of West Nile [[Virus]] to the adjacent states. Cajun women much like the gerbil have front teeth that continue to constantly grow and so they have to always gnaw and chew on something HARD!

Louisiana is also home to the vibrant [[New Orleans]]. Or at least it was, until [[Katrina]]. Where have all the [[crackwhore]]s and [[food]] gone? Oh well, it seems that [[George Bush doesn't care about black people]].

Tourist attractions in Louisiana include pine trees, nutria, and people with more than one tooth but [[less than three]] in their mouths. Do to massive amounts of inbreeding done in this penal colony over the centuries it is recommended by the U.S. State Department not to go there to visit.

[[Last Thursday]], Louisiana citizens finally got tired of electing the same [[W|dumbfucks]] over and over, who liked to raise taxes on fucking everything and then keep all the money for themselves and give each other [[Lemonparty|handjobs]] while the common folk continued to wallow in their own [[2girls1cup|shit]] and [[surprise sex]] their cousins and siblings. They therefore decided to elect as their proud new governor Piyush "Bobby" Jindal, an [[loli|underage]] [[India|Indian]] boy (wut), who's promised to bring jobs to Louisiana and repair its [[lulzy]] national image. Too bad Jindal doesn't actually give a fuck about the state and is just using it as a stepping stone to become [[McCain]]'s vice president and then take over the country when the old [[Republican|shithead]] dies a year into his 1st term, lol.

Recently, the cars had armed themselves against idiots. Now they can [http://www.law.wustl.edu/journal/55/109.pdf '''kill'''] them. Willy On Wheels and Grawp commented that the cars are armed with copies of his massive ass and shrunken dick.
