Frequently Asked Questions
'''Frequently Asked Questions''', or ''FAQ'', are simply questions that are frequently asked on the Internet by [[n00bs]]. It is common knowledge that 99% of internet users don't actually ever read a website's FAQ page(s), rendering them as the Internet's equivalent to "WET PAINT" signs and labels on [[Oxycontin]] scripts that say "DO NOT CHEW OR CRUSH!". Most [[website]]s have an FAQ page full of stupid questions (and presumably stupid answers) the webmaster keeps getting asked and have given him a twist in his ball sack.

==Avoiding Conflict==
It's common practice for new users to forego logical methods of gaining knowledge in favor of either pestering other users, or, in far more [[lol|lulzy]] and [[banhammer]]-worthy fashion, mailbombing admins for information readily available on site. To maintain your self-respect, attempt the following before bothering anyone else with your newfaggotry:
*[[RTFM|Find the FAQ on the sitemap.]] If you can't find it, try typing /FAQ after the domain, or opening your fucking eyes.
*[[Lurk]] more and see what other people are doing. It's okay, you're going to end up stealing other people's ideas and reposting mudkips anyway.
*Ask [[your mom]]. She's been around.
*Explore the site and its various functions. Learn by doing. Most things on the Internet are intuitive enough for [[16-year-old girl|people]] to figure out on their own.
*Check the forums (if available) for a section related to user questions and issues. There's probably an existing thread out there already that covers your [[Nobody Cares|dumbass question]]. Don't ask it again in the "Post Dick Pictures Here" section.
*If you really can't find the information anywhere else, then use the website's chain of command in contacting administrators. Contact the moderator before you call Bill Gates and ask him what [[The Game]] is. Your [[ED Sysops Active Duty Roster|SysOps]] will thank you.
