'''kgb''' is a pointless [[text]] service that started in 2009. Its '[[mission statement]]' is to make you even lazier (and poorer) by foregoing the likes of [[Google]] to get easy answers to mundane [[how do i shot web|everyday questions]] and settle bar arguments for 99¢ a pop. It's also a front for the [[russia|real KGB]].

It also provides hundreds of [[crap job]]s for the narcoleptic [[basement dwelling]] hobos who got laid off when Circuit City went bankrupt during the [[Great Recession]] of [[2009]].

KGB also refers to the killing gloves of boxing (Retard Mittens), worn by our favorite russian man-whore, the Heavy.


==How Do I Shot KGB?==

#Text your question to '''542542'''.
#Wait 15 minutes for a random basement dweller with better [[google]] skills than you to search for the answer.
#Receive answer you could have found yourself without paying 99¢.

If they can't find the answer you receive a text telling you that they can't find the answer and there is no charge. [[Lie|You also receive $1,000 and one month free service.]]

Sometimes, the random basement dweller is not aware of the '''kgb''' [[TOS]] so text him back and ask for his name and the name of his supervisor. Then call '''kgb''' and ask to speak to the supervisor to demand your prize. Be sure to mention [[ED]] referred you.

==Trolling KGB==
[[Image:meaningoflife.jpg|thumb|More [[retarded]] than an intentional [[troll]].]]
*Repeatedly ask them [[AIDS|why]] the pool at [[Habbo Hotel]] is closed every July. 
*Repeatedly ask for [[Battletoads]].
*Repeatedly ask them for illegal information like the best place to shoot heroin without it showing.
*Repeatedly ask them for advice about your [[cumdumpster]] not wanting to [[swallow]].
*Repeatedly ask them how not to [[I_accidentally_X|accidently]] a whole [[fleshlight]].
*Repeatedly insist that kgb is wrong about everything.
*Repeatedly insist you got pregnant from oral sex (they get that a lot).
*Repeatedly Text racist/horrible/sexist jokes, and see if they reply...they get [[butthurt|insta-fired]] for answering them.
*Repeatedly ask them why they are named after the disbanded Russia counterpart to the CIA.
*Spam the shit out of them.

Make sure they earn the 99¢ you got from an actually productive and socially useful job, even if you're just [[troll|trolling]]. They may be [[loser|just like you]] and only get [[slave|paid by the question]] but that's no reason to show mercy.

We of course have the power to make this go away. Its called [[google]] and its a reasonable .00¢ a text. Your call dumbasses.

==Update! [[PROTIP]]==
Due to [[lazy|popularity]], [[bucket|robotexting]] has been put in effect. Once a question has been asked and answered (or not) it is entered into a database. If you're a trolling black person, modify your outgoing text when asking the same question.

Actually, the above doesn't work. However, if you spell things wrong, they can't use the already answered questions! [[Winrar|Go for it!]]

They have also gained the power to send the [[Russia|actual KGB]] to your house.
