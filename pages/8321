The Trashman
[[Image:Trashman screencap.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Gentlemen]].]]
'''The Trashman''' (aka Anton Dunn) is a 42 year old "comedian" and black person [[troll]] who recently got [[partyvan]]ned for a well-publicized hoax on [[YouTube]].   '''Trashman''' claimed to have poisoned thousands of bottles of Gerber's baby food with cyanide in an effort to [[win|kill millions of black babies]] and faced up to [[assrape|10 years in prison]]. He pleaded guilty and got one year in prison, three years probation and mental health counseling. The Trashman was indeed a troll but the nature of his [[satire]] was [[Andy Kaufman|risque]] and the very definition of the [[drama bomb]].  He had a tendency to cause massive [[butthurt]] on the tubes, staging numerous hoaxes and [[trolling|goading]] retarded YouTubers on a regular basis.  The authorities didn't seem to see it this way though (Protip: [[Jake Brahm|they never do]]) and it wasn't long before he got caught.  He also operates a low-budget [[porn]] site for a living and states on his [[MySpace]] profile that he is an "[[Nigga Know Technology|Adult website owner looking to network with people in the porn and music world]]."

In a series of videos he release from April to July, [[2008]], he detailed a plan to poison Gerber's baby food products.  Gerber was not amused and [[The man|FDA]] didn't see it as such either.  FDA agents took notice and tracked Dunn via a web site registered in his name - [http://www.chroniccast.org chroniccast.org] - a [[self pwn|website he had streamed across the bottom of some of his videos]].  Dunn has apparently been arrested 3 times in the past year as well on charges unrelated to his video making and the [[prison|sentence]] he received for his Baby Food hoax probably means he won't be making more [[gay]] porn any time soon, just blowing [[bubba]].

==The [[AIDS]] videos==

<font color="red">Lol baleeted.</font>

Back in [[Last Thursday|April, 2008]] Trashman released another hoax video wherein he claimed to have infected between 12,000 - 15,000 [[women]] with his potent black [[AIDS]] [[semen]].  In the video, he basically just reads a list of names of [[black]] chicks he claims to have given the AIDS and then goes off on a tirade about how [[retarded]] they are to engage in [[STD|unsafe sex]].  The tubes are still cluttered with [[lulzy]] and [[pretentious|indignant]] responses to both his AIDS videos and his baby food videos.
