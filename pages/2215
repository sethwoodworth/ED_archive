'''DesuRadio''' and '''DesuTV''' are unofficial media outlets operated by DOZO, Inc., for the userbase of [[Desuchan]] desu. Both take their name from the '''greatest [[meme]] ever''', [[Desu]].

In June 2008, after getting frustrated with months of their website's intermittent downtime, a group of antsy [[faggots]] from [[Desuchan]] decided to create an internets radio station, calling it DesuRadio (no relation with the now-defunct [[Radio#Desu-radio|Desu-radio]]) desu. DesuRadio is based out of Desuchan's [[IRC]] channel desu. Later on in the year, after experimenting with different methods of streaming video, the same antsy faggots hooked up an account on Mogulus (now Livestream) to create DesuTV, which performed amazingly well compared to the radio desu.

Desuchan's unofficial Livestream video channels, administered by a junta of random desufags desu. There are currently three Desuchan TV channels, and a [http://twitter.com/desuchantv twitter feed] announcing shows and schedule changes desu.

===DesuTV (channel 1)===
The first (original) channel, known as '''DesuTV''' for short, usually autoplays random [[Youtube]] crap ranging from MADs/[[AMV]]s of anime like [[Rozen Maiden]] or [[shit no one cares about|Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni]], through [[Youtube Poop]]s and [[Touhou]] MADs to 2ch/Nicovideo meme vids when no admins are around desu. In the evenings Eastern time, though, people usually get online for live streaming sessions, with anime like Rozen Maiden (of course), Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star), Detroit Metal City, Dokuro-Chan, Ranma 1/2, Maria+Holic, Full Metal Panic, and the like desu.

===DesuGames (channel 2)===
Because Livestream is run by [[MPAA|fascist horsefuckers]] who cap video library storage at a shitty 10GB, DesuTV's second channel, '''DesuGames''', was created desu. This channel focuses exclusively on /v/ material, autoplaying hours of content including TF2/L4D/HL2/whatever machinima, [[Desuchan#Staff|Megu]]'s Desu Game Reviews, AVGN, AliBat playthroughs, myg0t rages, and so on. Like the first channel, people usually get online in the evenings to stream live games such as [[Touhou|Scarlet Weather Rhapsody]], PC-98 [[Touhou]] games, [[Legend of Zelda|Zelda: OoT]], and so on desu.

===DesuPoop (channel 3)===
A new channel, '''DesuPoop''', was just recently added to appease the vampiric lust of certain DesuTVfags for [[Youtube Poop]], and to make room on the main channel for more [[desu]]. This channel focuses exclusively on Youtube Poop, whether Desu-related, anime-related, vidya-related, or altogether [[not]] desu. Extremely [[troll|trolly]] desu.

===Mods/VJs===
Basically, anyone who wants to stream shit can be a ZOMG VJ; the way to do it is to ask the channel owner for streaman rights, download the appropriate software, and then fail to suck desu.
However, there isn't a single 'VJ' who is worth thinking about or caring about, just go and [[an hero]] you [[fag]].

==DesuRadio in History==
{{main|Radio#Desu-radio}}

Originally created by a [[b/tard|/b/tard]] named Spork in 2006 and run by a [[weeaboo]] called Neoific, Desu-radio (note the dash) was one of the first "anon radios" (along with [[W.T. Snacks|Midnight Snacks]]), having a reputation of playing "[[shit|random]]" music half the time, and being down the other half desu.  During its brief heyday, Desu-Radio could get about 50 listeners online at any given time—upwards of 150 listeners if there was a thread going in /b/—a maximum of about 300 listeners connected at different times during its Labor Day weekend special in 2006 desu. Several events happening in the space of a few months at the end of 2006, however, led to its sharp decline, after which many of the DJs migrated to [[Radio#/a/radio|/a/radio]] desu. The old and dead Desu-Radio website still remains at [http://desu.ninjabeams.org/ desu.ninjabeams.org] desu.
