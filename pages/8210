The Great Deathly Hallows IRL Raid of 2007
[[Image:TrollingPotterfagsIRL.jpg|thumb|Just one of the many [[IRL Troll]]s that were out in force.]]
On July 21, [[2007]], the 7th and Final [[Harry Potter]] book came out. Just like [[The Great Dumbledore Dies Meme of 2005|the last book]], [[Ebaumsworld]] was able to obtain a copy, many days before it was due to come out, and post pictures online for everyone to [[pirate]], and spoil the ending. However, this leak differed from the last in that [[over 9000]] people [[Harry_Potter#Lol_Dead_people_spoilers:|die]] in this book, marking a ten-fold increase in [[lulz]] potential. Combine this with the fact that potterfags are enormous [[lol-cow]]s, and the [[Ebaumsworld|forces of hell]] had ample preparation time, you have a perfect storm of lulz, the likes of which few have ever witnessed.

== History ==

[[Harry Potter]] has an enormous [[Fandom]] consisting of [[over 9000|over three million]] 16 year old girls, and [[basement-dweller]]s who can't come to terms with the fact that these books are [[fiction|FICTION]], and that they will never be anything more than the [[snapesnogger|worthless piles of crap]] that they are now. So it's only natural that when, quite possibly, the biggest event in these worthless people's lives comes around, that [[Ebaumsworld]] should try to ruin it in every way possible.

=== The Months before ===

Before the real [[Harry_Potter#The_Ruination_of_Potterfags_.2707|lulz]] came out, [[Ebaumsworld]] was happy with spreading [[lie|fake]] spoilers, and [[troll]]ing their forums. much to the [[angst]] of the Potter [[emo|fanbase]]. JK Rowling responded by assuring everyone that the book would not get out before it was due. Oh how wrong she was.

=== The Ruination of Potterfags ===

Of course, it is fucking impossible to keep [[Ebaumsworld]] from getting what [[Ebaumsworld]] really wants. So naturally, a week before the set release date, someone got a copy of the book, and took digital pictures of every last page, because he was too black person to afford a scanner, and uploaded all of them onto [[Gaia Online]]. Soon, the leaked pictures of the book spread to every last corner of the internet, and no potterfag was safe from [[legion]], as they descended upon the unsuspecting masses. [[Troll]]s everywhere had a field day.

AND NOW I AM GOING TO GO AND DIE, BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SPOILED FOR BOOK SEVEN, JUST LIKE I WAS SPOILED FOR BOOK FIVE|Dumbass}}

Before the release of the book, the easiest way to ruin a potterfag was:<br>

1) Get spoilers <br>
2) Pick your favorite venue <br>
3) [[Spam]] like you've never spammed before <br>
4) Keep spamming. <br>
5) ??? <br>
6) [[rape|raep]]/[[profit|PROFIT!]] <br>
(Rape and profit are the same thing)

== Mass IRL Trolling ==

There where scheduled mass-congregations of [[faggot]]s, and [[pedo|small children]] at book stores across the globe on the night of the release. Anonymous was not invited to these "pre-release parties", so the [[Legion]] decided to gate-crash them, and proceeded to [[troll]] the fuck out of everyone there. [[Lulz]] of all kinds, from drive-by yelling, to walking into the store with megaphones, caused many to become [http://martinaquino.wordpress.com/2007/07/20/teenage-girl-kills-herself-over-fake-spoilers-of-harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows/ an hero].

[[Image:Potterforumsclosed.jpg|thumb|right|Potter's Closed]]
At approximately 2:30 AM EST 7/18/07, Potterforums.com was hacked, and an email explaining that the forum was closed due to AIDS was sent then listed out all the spoilers to everyone on their mailing list! The site was actually attacked twice, with both spam bots and crap flood. The admins had to close the forum down to delete all the spoiled content, and ban all the spam accounts generated. Then a second attack-ninja looted the user log and emailed every registered user a copy of the book 7 spoilers. At press time, Ebaums World has taken credit for the attack. [[Moar]] details to follow as they develop...
