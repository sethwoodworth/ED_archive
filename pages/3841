I-Dosing
{{stub}}

I-Dosing is an internet-induced form of self-delusion oligophrenic kiddies resort to believe they're getting high. Pretty much like smoking construction paper in middle school. 

[[lie|In theory]] "I-Dosing" [[fail|works]] by downloading a disturbing soundtrack, plugging the inner ear with invasive earphones and bumping up the volume until the pain is so intense [[idiot|the subject]] begins to delude him- or herself into believing she's getting high, much like being anally penetrated. 

I-doses use something called binaural beats, which supposedly can have an effect on your brain waves. There is little research or proof that this is true. Most people who are I-dosing may be experiencing a placebo effect.

{{quote|When I started I-Dosing a year ago it was just for fun. I had an otherwise  [[boring|normal]] life. Fast forward to now... I've been layed off, I lost my car, and I I-Dose every chance I can get. To pay for my fix I black person and a couple of times [[Scott_Brown|prostituted myself]], just for the iTunes money.

==Reactions==

I-dosing has caused moral outrage from clueless parents, and bizarre behavior from equally clueless teenagers. Below is a small gallery of these reactions.
