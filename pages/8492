Anyone who's ever tried seriously editing these [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] articles! Remember [[13 year old boy|that guy]] who thought it would be absolutely [[Lulz|lulz-worthy]] to [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|spam the entire page]] with [[GIF|gifs]] involving ''Hey Arnold!'' characters and a penis? Remember how [[Moderator|they]] immediately [[b&]] his ass and how he [[Taking down ED|swore vengeance]], claiming he someday show the world how [[Gay|hilarious]] he was? 

'''''Tosh.Fucking 0''''' is that guy who created the a pedophile website called [[jailbaitgallery.com]].

If you're attempting to create [[Impossible|create quality television]], there's obviously a lot of room for [[Fail|epic failure]] and misfires, as evidenced by [[iCarly]] and <s>pretty much</s> anything produced by [[4Kids]]. And yet, no matter how pitiful your eventual creation may be, at least it's damn-near impossible to replace ''Drawn Together,'' [[Jeff Dunham]] (both distributed [[DO NOT WANT|courtesy]] of the always-consistent [[Comedy Central]]), and other [[Chris-chan|certain standards]] you couldn't sink to if you tried. Yet, even under these bleak circumstances, Comedy Central manages to [[Fail|strike gold]] with Tosh.0, a program guilty of [[Rape|raping]] the [[Internets]] until there's nothing left but dehydrated [[cum]]. This isn't ED taking cheap shots at something of [[Shit noone cares about|debatable quality]], like [[South Park]] or even [[The Daily Show|The Daily Fucking Show]]. No, ''Tosh'' is like the [[Final boss]] of shitty [[Television|TV shows]]. If you thought [[The Simpsons]] had gone to hell, wait until you watch this.

==The Show==

Deep from the asshole of basic cable that is [[Comedy Central]], located somewhere between their endless reruns of [[South Park]] and '''Reno 911''', comes '''Tosh.0''': an [[Shit|oh-so-hilarious]] show presented by professional [[moot]] impersonator [[Fag|Daniel Tosh]]. The soon-to-be canceled show [[rape|humps the leg]] of the [[Internet]], and sucks dry everything that [[/b/|/b/tards]] hold dear ''(instead of honing a practical skill or talent)''.

[[Some argue|Many accuse]] the show of being a [[SSP|shameless]] rip-off of G4's ''Web Soup''. [[Shit nobody cares about|This is inaccurate]], as ''Web Soup'' in itself is an unfunny spin-off of E!'s ''The Soup'', which was actually remade from the ashes of ''Talk Soup'', a program which in turn was a rip-off of VH1's ''Web Junk'' hosted by that annoying white guy from ''Half-Baked''. Taking all these arguments into consideration, Tosh.0 is pure shit.

While [[Lie|some hail]] the show's eponymous host Daniel Tosh as the second coming of [[Tom Green]], in reality he's simply a failed insult comic who constantly falls back on [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|retarded humor usually shared in middle school]]. This includes, [[DO NOT WANT|but is not limited to]] [[Dick Masterson|Women-bashing]] humor in order to hide his inability to come up with [[original content]]. Possibly the only amusing part of the show actually happens off-screen, as Tosh participates in "live chats" with viewers over [[Twitter]] during the premieres of new episodes. These chats boil down to Tosh [[Trolling|brutally mocking anybody stupid enough to watch his show]] as his own penance for allowing it to air in the first place.

===Mission Statement===

{{quote|Blogs, vlogs, tweets and pokes have taken over everyone's lives and it's high time someone takes these new technologies to task. Nothing on the Internet is safe in the hands of comedian Daniel Tosh in COMEDY CENTRAL's new series, "Tosh.0."|Comedy Central, unaware of the fact that [[G4]] already tried and failed miserably at this venture.}} 

Tosh has a [[Dubious disclaimer|disclaimer]] which states that he didn't [[Al Gore|invent the Internet]]; he "just makes fun of it". While anybody with half a brain should be able to [[Captain Obvious|figure this out]] on their own, Tosh realizes that his target audience is lacking even that, and constantly reiterates and repeats this disclaimer in every episode. You know; just in case [[Stupid|you forget that he didn't actually invent the internet himself]]!

To meet this goal, he repeats the same three stale jokes every episode ''("[[Women]] are stupid!", "[[Rednecks]] are stupid!", and "[[Swap.avi|lol look at her vomit]]")'' over [[Old meme|old]] viral videos, which everybody with a [[YouTube]] account has already seen at least six fucking years prior. There are also a number of [[gimmick]] bits on the show, including a segment where he sees how many obvious observations he can make about a clip in the span of 20 seconds. However, much like the painfully unfunny [[TGWTG|That Guy With the Glasses]] segment "5 Second Movies", he takes far longer than the time allotted so he can dispense more [[Sarcasm|hilarious]] bits of [[unfunny|comedy]] [[piss|gold]] before moving on to his next novelty segment.

===Web Redemptions===

Perhaps the greatest shame is the program's "Web Redemption" segment, which is [[awesome]] in concept but executed so poorly by the show that you end up wishing they didn't even bother trying. Basically, Tosh manages to arrange interviews with the stars of viral videos ''(Long after they've stopped being funny or [[Relevant to my interests|relevant]])'', under the agreement that he will give them a [[Undo|"chance at redemption on live television"]]. In other words, he tacks an extra minute onto their 15 minutes of fame, feeding [[USI|their already inflated egos]] while simultaneously [[Greed|exploiting them]] for his own purposes.

He routinely uses shirtless men during his web redemptions to make his audience think he's making a joke about being gay, when in reality he is just trying to cover up his own faggotry.

While the idea of finding out what happened to the stars of [[Template:Oldweb|Web 1.0]] looks good on paper, Tosh's horrid interview manner sucks the lulz dry faster than the [[Afro Ninja]] fucks up a backflip. It'd be fine if he was insulting like he is during the rest of the show, but for some reason, he feels compelled to patronize these retards, despite their being smart enough to realize that participating means [[SSP|getting to be on TV]]. The end results are lulzless interview segments, followed by lulzless heavily-scripted skits in which Tosh attempts to upstage the stars while they attempt to redeem themselves.

Here is a list of old memes which Tosh has [[Zombie|revived]], only to kill again moments later.
