Once considered the [[GOP]]'s Lord and Saviour as the second coming of <s>Jesus Christ</s> [[Ronald Reagan]], '''Freddie "Fred" Thompson''' (aka '''Frankenberry''') and the loyal [[fanbois|fanbase]] who urged him to [[actor|quit his day job]] on TV and re-enter [[IRL]] politics to save the party from certain defeat at the hands of any Democrat with a pulse in the 2008 US elections, are currently looking like the fools who swore the Emperor was wearing new clothes in the [[faggotry|old fairy tale]].  He eventually gained even more fame by running the second most [[fail]] campaign in history behind goomba cross dresser [[Rudy Giuliani]].
Once a [[lazy]] Senator and part-time yokel with a reputation for [[fail]]ing upwards, this gruff [[alzheimers|Reagan Republican]] had spent his recent years [[lazy|phoning it in]] as [[NYC]]'s District Attorney in TV's [[tl;dr|long-running]] legal procedural [[shit nobody cares about|Law & Order]].

When other candidates are enjoying  [[Camwhore| non stop spotlight and glorious discussion of the issues]],   Fred Thompson has been relegated to the Skid Row of Political campaigning. Basically, [[Shit nobody cares about| no one gives a fuck anymore]].

{{quote|'We need to be a nation of high fences and wide gates.' A man in the audience called out in agreement. 'You like that?' Thompson asked hopefully. "Alright," he continued, looking for some momentum. 'Can I get a round of applause?' '''A few long seconds later,''' the crowd obliged. |''CBS News December 31st 2007''. Even his BASE [[Erectile dysfunction| can no longer get it up.]]}}

{{quote|The lazier a man is, the more he plans to do tomorrow|Fred Thompson -in his high school year book}}

Fred Thompson is -in a word- [[lazy]]. By all accounts, he was a lazy boy, a lazy teen, a lazy US Attorney and a lazy Senator. Even when courting his blue-blooded first wife, he was half-assed about it leading her father to question his acumen,lack of ambition and suitability for his daughter.

===[[afk|School]]===
[[Image:Lazy Freddie.JPG‎|thumb|right|Fred Thompson (left).  Doing Nothing.''.]]
At high school, his football coach in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, told reporters: 

{{quote|He was smart, but he was lazy. He probably could have been a straight-A student if he'd applied himself.|Coach}} 

He was a clown, known for tossing ice in the cafeteria, making paper airplanes and throwing pennies at the blackboard when the teacher wasn’t looking.

===[[bbl|Legal Practise]]===
[[Image:Nixon-on-thompson.jpg‎|thumb|right|Fred Thompson: The Hair Days. The lights are on but ain't nobody home.]]
During the breaking [[Richard Nixon|Watergate Scandal]] in the early '70s, Freddie served as leader of the Republican side in the Senate's investigation of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s involvement. Years after Nixon's eventual impeachment, The Freedom of Information Act released tapes of the Nixon team's secret discussions about how much shit he was in.

In a May 1973 recording, Nixon shared his concern about whether his own party would go after him with then-chief of staff Alexander Haig.

{{quote|He's talking to Fred Thompson.|Haig}}

{{quote|Oh shit,[[fact| he's dumb as hell]]...Fred Thompson|Nixon}}

In a later conversation Nixon and lawyers were still describing Thompson as not so smart but at least he was [[pwnt|beginning to play ball]].

{{quote|We've got a pretty good rapport with Thompson. He came through fine for us this morning.|Nixon counsel Fred Buzhardt}}

{{quote|He isn't very smart, is he? But he's friendly.|Nixon. A nice way of saying [[retarded]]}}.

===[[brb|The Senate]]===
With eight years in the [[government|Senate]], his legislative record was almost non-existent. A former adviser is quoted as saying: 

{{quote|While the Senate is filled with [[:Image:aspirations.jpg|ambitious men]] who aren't in a rush to get home at night, Senator Thompson kept a lean formal schedule, did the bare minimum to get by and then hightailed it to the [[OM NOM NOM NOM|Prime Rib or the Capital Grille]].|Aide}}
 

==[[LOL WUT|The Run <s>For</s> From '08]]==
[[Image:Thompson_mope.png|thumb|right|Official campaign poster]]

Before being pressured to run for the Republican nomination in the middle of 2007, he was a lazy [[bribery|lobbyist]] and lazy [[anon|character actor]] after he quit representing Tennessee in the Senate because it was too much hard work.

Even Fred Thompson doesn't think he will become president. Chatting to a television reporter, a [[lulz|quip]] from the Hollywood actor cemented the impression that his heart is not in the 2008 race.

Whist trying to motivate his studio to hurry up and interview Freddie, a [[Fox News]] exec said: 


{{quote|The next president of the United States has a schedule to keep.|Carl Cameron}} 

Standing beside him, a deadpan Thompson interjected: 

{{quote|And so do I!|Frank Fred}}

In fact, he had absolutely no ambition to be the President of the USA, he was just too lazy to argue with those around him who were pushing him to run.
