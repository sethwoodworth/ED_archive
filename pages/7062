Romare Bearden (born September 2, 1911, died March 12 1988 of [[cancer]]) was a lulzy [[artist]] who [[wigger|thought he was black]]. Probably never had trouble getting a cab in his life.

He was born in Charlotte, [[North Carolina]], but then moved to New York City, where he spent most of his days. He attended De Witt [[Clinton]] High School, then went on to New York University, but his education was interrupted because he played in the [[lol wut|Negro League]]. He got started doing [[politics|political]] [[webcomic|cartoons]], then some [[Time Cube|cubism]]. Then he went off to [[World War II]], and when he came back, started making crappy collages.

==Collages==

During the 60s he became very interested in [[Victim complex|Civil Rights]] and the plight of his people. So, he protested white oppression the only way he knew how: by cutting pictures out of magazines and gluing them on paper. But it turned out people loved his little collages, and he made millions. Despite his porkiness, he died in 1988 not from a heart attack, but from bone [[cancer]].
