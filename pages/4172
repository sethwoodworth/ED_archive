Jack Merridew
{{boring}}

'''[[Wikipedia:User:Jack Merridew|Jack Merridew]]''' was a prominent [[deletionist]] on [[Wikipedia]] until he was [[Rape|banned]] on March 31, 2008, when it was discovered that he had [[over 9,000]] [[Sock puppet|cockpuppets]] used for pushing his [[Faggotry|deletion campaign]] and for [[Harassment|harassing]] known [[drama whore]] [[Wikipedia:User:White Cat|White Cat]]/Cool Cat. His oldest known account was [[Wikipedia:User:Davenbelle|Davenbelle]], and two other major accounts of his were [[Wikipedia:User:Diyarbakir|Diyarbakir]] and [[Wikipedia:User:Moby Dick|Moby Dick]]. He is also known to have two other minor accounts called [[Wikipedia:User:D73733C8-CC80-11D0-B225-00C04FB6C2F5|D73733C8-CC80-11D0-B225-00C04FB6C2F5]] and [[Wikipedia:User:Note to Cool Cat|Note to Cool Cat]].

==Biography==
“Jack Merridew” is a pseudonym derived from some pathetic character in ''[[Wikipedia:Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Flies]].'' His real name is David.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jack_Merridew&diff=202340604&oldid=202338600 ]

Jack hates stuff to do with popular culture such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]],'' ''[[Star Wars]],'' and ''[[Wikipedia:Honorverse|Honorverse]],'' so he goes around vomiting tags all over their respective Wikipedia articles and tries to get them deleted. This earned him the friendship of an epic faggot and fellow deletionist known as [[Wikipedia:Gavin.collins|Gavin Collins]], and they are now [[BFF|best friends forever]]. This also earned him the enmity of fellow cockpuppeteer [[Grawp]], who was known for making Jack [[butt-hurt]] for several months. Jack was also frequently raided by [[b/|eBaum's World]], as can be seen [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJack_Merridew&diff=192177345&oldid=192177252 here.]

Originally, Jack Merridew’s account name was “[[Wikipedia:User:Senang Hati|Senang Hati]],” which he used to create spam articles for the [[Wikipedia:Senang Hati Foundation|Senang Hati Foundation]] and [[Wikipedia:Smile Foundation of Bali|Smile Foundation of Bali]], two organizations in Bali that kidnap children with facial disfigurements such as cleft lips and subsequently engage in [[Pedophilia|pederasty]]. He had the account renamed to “Jack Merridew,” and then Grawp created a new account called “Senang Hati” [[for the lulz]], which he used to try to get Jack’s spam deleted. Grawp was unsuccessful, and the account was renamed to “[[Wikipedia:User:Senang Hati (impersonator)|Senang Hati (impersonator)]].” [[Irony|Ironically]], Jack’s spam articles still exist, even though they are [[shit]].

Jack Merridew is an English-speaking [[retard]], most likely an [[Ausfag]], who, after getting kicked out of his native country, moved to an island called Bali in Indonesia.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Episodes_and_characters_2/Workshop#Indefinite_block_of_Jack_Merridew ] There, he works for the Senang Hati Foundation and Smile Foundation of Bali, where is he is paid in child [[Slavery|slaves]] to use as sex toys. After being put in [[Bantown]] yet again, he is most likely being entertained by such slaves as you read this.

==The Drama Continues==
Mainly due to support from his deletionist buddies and sucking the cocks of various TOW admins in the [[Cabal]], Jack Merridew was unblocked on May 2, 2008, much to the dismay of the faggot White Cat. However, he was blocked forever once again just two days later [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Jack_Merridew ] after much drama-mongering. He is now confined to editing shitty little projects like the Indonesian Wikipedia and [[Wikimedia Commons]], having his deletionist buddies spam his shitty [[Balls|Balinese]] pictures all over [[TOW]]. Jack is obsessed with drama and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jack_Merridew his edits] are pretty much only on talk or bureaucracy pages. TOW is just a place to interact with people over the internet for Jack and Nothing he adds to the encyclopedia has any value.

==More Drama Coming Soon==

===''"A Leopard Doesn't Change Its Spots"'' ~ Jack Merridew March 16, 2010 ===

Jack has got those admins fooled. He puts on his "I have seen the error of my ways. I've changed. I am reformed. I'm no longer an a**hole" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Motions/Jack_Merridew_one_year_unban_review/mentors_page#I_wish_all_restrictions_to_be_lifted_so_that_I_am| act]. Those idiots are dead from the neck up. Jack isn't bright, it's just that they are so pathetically gullible. While telling them this, Jack's subconscious leaves little turds of truth about himself on Wikipedia, like this one from his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jack_Merridew#Hold_on,_please...| talk page] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jack_Merridew&diff=prev&oldid=350117372| also here]) where he says that he has never seen a leopard change his spots. We agree Jack, too bad the admins don't pay attention to your unchanged spots. 

One day, after ignoring these little turds of truth from Jack, those admins are going to wake up too late to see that they and Wikipedia have been ass raped by Jack. Those admins better lube up as the day is coming sooner than they think.

===Jack Asks To Be Made An Administrator===

On March 16, 2010, ol' Jack made a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&diff=prev&oldid=353098643| request] to be made an administrator. Stock up on that lubricant Wikipedia. You are going to need it. The clock is ticking.
