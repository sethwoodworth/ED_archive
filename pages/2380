Dr. Phail
[[Image:Drphilleather.jpg|thumb|Dr. Phil in full leather atire.]]

'''Dr. Phail''' is a new [[fursona|persona]] on Avatar Palace; its main intention is to generate [[lulz]]. There is absolutely no knowing where this is heading yet; Dr. Phail is a police psychiatrist in lullerzcounty, lullaria and has absolutely no sense of what the young hipsters of today like.

Dr. Phail likes Huey Lewis and the news, Bananarama, Milli Vanilli and the Cosby show. He defiantly knows to his heart it's hip to be square. Including his 74 year old wife, triplets and two other children. He needs help communicating [[moar]] with the young hipster, which is pretty gosh darn hard when you are 45 and still wear the same Cosby sweaters you once bought in the 80s and a bow tie.

==Lollerlog 2, Dr. Phail wishes to become a gangster==

Dr. Phail visits [[Chat palace]] gangsta rooms and wishes to join their fine fraternaty's. However, he isn't familiar with their jive lingo:
