Rules 1 and 2

[[Fight Club]]'s famous [[Rules 1 and 2]] were [[theft|adopted]] by [[/b/]]tards to become part of the [[Rules Of The Internet]]. After all, /b/ ''IS'' Fight Club, bitch.

{{quote|Rule 1: You do not talk about /b/<br/>Rule 2: You DO NOT talk about /b/|Simple rules.}}

It is very important to remember that the internet is [[serious fucking business]] and that these [[rules]] must be obeyed.  If they are not obeyed [[4chan]] might be shut down and the [[nerds|internet superheroes]] who use it will have nowhere to [[fap|say nice things]] to [[CP|anonymous people]].

{{quote|Anyone who takes the rules seriously is a complete faggot.|People who are<s>n't</s> faggots}}

Breaking the aforementioned rules is an unavoidable consequence of having to explain them to noobs. This is ok however, because [[irony|the rules were made by]] [[Gaia]]fags. Rules 1 and 2 were taken lightly until the [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|fallout]] from the [[Pools Closed|The Great Habbo Raid of July 2006]] left /b/ a shell of what it used to be. Since then, many [[Veteran|/b/tards]] have taken it upon themselves to [[irony|protect the name of /b/ from the internet]]. [[Camwhores]] may circumvent the rules, but only by writing it on their <s>(fake)</s> [[tits]].


The interpretation of the rules is still up for debate. [[Some argue]] that the merely mentioning [[4chan]] outside of 4chan counts as an infraction, while [[Newfag]]s tell all their 13-year old friends about /b/ and turn it into fucking [[MySpace]].

==Arguments of Rules 1 & 2==
===A Counter Argument===
[[Image:batrules.jpg|frameless|right]]
As Rules 1 & 2 of the Internet originally came from Fight Club, they retain their original purpose: to keep new people out. Newfags don't understand /b/, and bastardize everything they touch in it. Also, the August Exception only serves to make Rules 1 & 2 into a useless declaration to keep potential raid targets from entering /b/.

Furthermore, trolling /b/ is like pissing in an ocean of piss. [[NORP|Average people]] who venture into /b/ are <s>driven out by an autoimmune system of [[guro]], [[racism]], foul language, and constant trolling</s> welcomed warmly with easy to insert, old and shitty meme [[dildo|suppositories]]. A major reason to NOT talk about /b/ (except to other /b/tards) is to prevent [http://www.zazzle.com/4chan+gifts bullshit like this].

Unfamiliar newfags that completely and arrogantly ignore these rules cause time-treasured (or otherwise) memes to be stolen by [[Jews]]. When newfags follow The August Exception, shit like the [[Longcat Crusade]], this [[Gaia Online]] [[faggotry]], and this [[I Can Has Cheezburger%3F]] shit happens.

Rules 1 & 2 apply everywhere. DON'T FUCKING FORGET IT. This means no /b/ T-shirts, no /b/ posters, no /b/ tattoos; nothing that promotes or advertises /b/. Promoting or advertising 4chan is something a bit different, but considering faggots usually walk up to you and ask "lolwats 4chon?!?!?!?!" it's probably not a good idea to talk about 4chan either.

===Another Quick Point===
{{quote|You're a fucking noob if you don't know the rules of 4chan.  #1: Don't talk about /b/.  #2: DON'T TALK ABOUT /b/!.|Anonymous|on the Times Top 100 poll commentating on Anon's [[Spam|normal posting activities]], March 2009.}}

While these may be the "Rules of the Internet", they are not necessarily endorsed by 4chan itself. One click on the [http://www.4chan.org/rules#b actual rules of 4chan] reveals that besides the normal [[CP|limitations]], 4chan is essentially [[anarchy|rule-free]], and we all know that [[Lie|4channers follow the 4chan rules]].

== The August Exception ==
In an attempt to save face, [[Anonymous]] attempted to rewrite [[history]] with the following declaration:

{{quote|Rules 1 and 2 only apply to [[raids]].|Anonymous|in [[/b/]] replying to Anonymous citing "Rule #1 and #2" on August 7th, 2007}}
Anonymous will probably repeat it until it catches on and is accepted as [[truth]] by all [[b|/b/tards]].

[[time paradox|Citing The August Exception in reply to citations of Rules 1 & 2]] became a meme in itself, instantly creating drama between supporters and detractors of The August Exception.

[[Tumblr|But hey, it's not like anonymous will organize another raid ever again right?]]

==The Animal Farm Exception==

{{quote|2 rules good, 4 rules bad.}}

This was inserted just to annoy people who think that [[ED]] is turning into [[Uncyclopedia]].
