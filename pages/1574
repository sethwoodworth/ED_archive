{{spoilers|text=CRONO DIES, MAGUS WAS JANUS THE ENTIRE TIME, AND DALTON IS STILL ALIVE IN THE DS VERSION}}
<b>''Chrono Trigger''</b> = [[No|ZOMG. BEST. FUCKING. GAME. EVER.]] Also, it was a highly popular [[SNES|Super Nintendo]] game that was (and still is) used frequently in [[YTMND]] fads. It is legitimately regarded as a RPG [[epic]], despite featuring a [[retarded|protagonist that is completely mute]].  In this game, one [[time paradox|time-travels]] to accomplish [[penis|junk]] like going back in time to fight a vicious [[troll|mole]] and save a princess. I shit you not. The original characters were designed by [[Dragon Ball Z]]'s Akira Toriyama and, as evidenced by the picture, we can see [[bullshit|he put a shit ton of effort into new and fresh characters]].

==Typical Conversation==
Dumbass A: "What's your favorite RPG, buttbuddy?"

Dumbass B: "''[[Final Fantasy 7]]'', but of course ''Chrono Trigger'' comes second."

''[[Quest 64]]'' is the true winner, unbeknown to either of the faggots.

== Crono ==
Would have been called Chrono but each character was [[fail|only allowed five letters in their game name]].  The poster child for the video game [[meme|trend]] where the [[lol wat|main character cannot talk]]. Also bears a striking resemblance to the main character in Secret of Mana-- thus perpetuating the incidence of [[weeaboo|13year-old boys]] around the world believing that they are [[no|uniquely chosen for a mystic destiny]].

== Magus ==
[[Image:Trunksjanus.jpg|thumb|[[wat|Guess which one is Janus!]] ]]
Magus is the blue-purple haired [[gothic]] [[elf]] [[magick|wizard]] thing who teenagers masturbate over and write terrible [[slashfic]]. Of course, once [[Final Fantasy 7]] was released, [[Sephiroth]] came along and took his place as the resident long haired [[goth]] [[faggot]] of video game fandom. [[emo|Riku]] from [[kingdom Hearts|Kingdom Hearts]] tried to make a run for the title, but the crown has yet to be relinquished.

<p>An important side note is that Magus is his drag queen stage name. His actual name is Janus, which just so happens to contain the word '[[anus]]'. Is that a coincidence? 
<br>Hardly. <br><br>Both Janus/Magus hail from the [[emo]] [[cock|persuasion]]. Check out this irrefutable evidence:
# They don't talk much.
# They're [[women|moody]] and bring you down when they actually do.
# They complain about the woe of their lives and the [[niggers|darkness]] therein.
# They presumably write poetry when not [[LARP|practicing the art of magic]].
# Their hair obscures the face.

Some [[13-year-old boy]]s still idolize him even though the game was released [[at least 100|some 13 years ago]] and can be seen putting his stupid lines from the game in their signatures on message boards like [[GameFAQs]].

== Frog/Glenn ==
[[Image:Mla.jpg|thumb|The game is so good even the [[Rule 34]] is decent.]]
Frog was a green haired fag knight who was turned into a frog by magus. He joins the party to defeat magus and turn himself back. He discovers the cure can only be obtain orally through Magus' cock which is an optional ending for the game. He was created to spread furdom to animals with scales for furries too radical for mainstream fur fagdom.

== Rick Robo ==
[[Image:Rick-robo.gif|thumb|Rick Astley [[akira|after becoming bonded with]] the [[Internet Hate Machine]] ]]
From far in the future comes this [[steampunk]] [[cock|monstrosity]]. While "Robo" may look like a regular [[whore|ho]]-hum robot, the truth could be no farther and more complex. In reality, the metal shell serves as a heavily protected mobile [[hugbox|sarcophagus]] containing the body of none other than [[anonymous|our]] very own [[Rick Astley]]. Thanks to the miraculous power of the [[internet hate machine]], Rick has the power to [[old meme|survive until the end of time]].

His side-quest is [[boring|notable]] as well.  Robo plots to break free of the evil [[Communist]] regime, and his [[slut|girlfriend]] is the only other one who'll believe in him.  After destroying [[Metroid|Mother Brain]], the fembot tells him that his name is really [[Greece|Prometheus]].  [[Shit nobody cares about|Wait, no one's read Anthem, right?]] Whatever the hell that is.

Evidence of this [[rape|holiest of unions]] is plainly heard in this musical overlay of theme songs.

== Endings ==
''Chrono Trigger,'' famous for multiple endings which varied based on when you finished the game. For example if you fail to steal the idol from the lizard [[trolls]] in the ancient time and choose to beat the big boss right then and there, the world winds up turning out like [[Atlanta]].

==Square-Enix Trolls the Fans==
If you follow the [[drama|news]] regarding ''Chrono Trigger'', you know Square-Enix is notorious for trolling the fans. (''Chrono Resurrection'' anyone?)  Well on May 8th of 2009, they went at it again, this time [http://www.chronocompendium.com/CEOrder.PDF pwning a fan ROM hack years in the making]!  [[Lulz|Apparently reverse-engineering a game is illegal these days]].
