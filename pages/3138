Also known as the [[Furry]] [[Illuminati]]. A secret organization that exists to create moar [[Drama]]. Members of this group are leaders within the Furry Community that go around spreading lies and misinformation (if they didn't exist, then they wouldn't have had to edit this) about the furry community. Its leader, the puppy rapist [[ContiE]], prevents verifiable sources from giving the truth about furries on [[wikipedia]]'s furry articles and other places--including facts from reliable media sources like MTV and Vanity fair as well as [[furry art|pictures]] [[yiff|that]] [[The Kadaitcha Dancers|tell]] [[goatse|the]] [[furry|truth]].  If you think Bugs Bunny or Chewbacca are cool you are not a furry, but if you want to have sex with them you are--but The Furluminati claims that anyone who has watched either on TV is a furry. The Furluminati is associated with the [http://otherkinawakening.20fr.com/index.html Otherkin conspiracy].

==The true Cause==
Many people died to get this top secret information. Memorize it well, lest the Furluminati delete this entire section because of its compromising qualities.

The Furluminati want to overthrow the government, secure a new world order run by furries, and kill all humans and make them their slaves, [[necrophilia|in that order]]. The Furluminati have a strong grip in Europe, Australia and Canada, and they intend to overthrow the American government next. YOU MUST STOP THEM, THEY WILL [[Rape|KILL YOU]]!

The above statement would not have been said if the Furluminati didn't actually exist.  The people would have said "Oh look, propaganda" and carried on with their lives, forgotten of the Furluminati.
