[http://www.ishkur.com '''Ishkur'''] is the web's leading pretentious [[techno]] fuck.

He runs an ugly mess of a site which bemoans the ravers of today, accusing them all of being [[drug]]gies and assholes.  Which makes sense, since he's a fifty-year old [[faggot|club kid]] and, having been banned from every club in [[Canada]], one tends to romanticize their club-going days.  Instead of doing the right thing and putting his [[wapanese|anime-loving]], Ecstasy-addled brain out of its misery, he writes obsessively about [[Oprah]] and attacks [[13 year old boy]]s who call him on his bullshit.

==Guide to Electronic Music==

While the site offers a myriad selection of RaV3R rants and activities (including an [[RPG]] [http://www.ishkur.com/dnd/ lol]), the main attraction is Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music.

The Guide is basically a circular roadmap covering every single subgenre of electronic music, offering [[at least 100]] low-quality samples of the same goddamn song on every page.  But don't let that keep you away!  Also bundled with each little music node is a snarky, [[autofellatio|self-appreciating]] quip pointing out why that particular type of music is less cool than the "[[Wigger|Ghettotech]]" genre and sometimes the author himself.

At any rate, the guide is unavailable on the site at the moment due to him recreating it.  In its stead is a fast-paced montage of raver bullshit and a statement telling us that he will be done when he damn well pleases.  He also begs for money, because PayPal are totally [[PLUR]].
