Believe everything you read

When on the [[internets]] you will read a lot of things, and [[some argue]] that you must be careful what to believe. These people are [[fucktard]]s, why would anyone want to lie to [[faggot|you?]] What would they have to [[Profit|gain?]] Whatever anyone says on the internet is [[fact]] and should be interpreted as so. The proof of this is that this page is on the internet, [[circular logic|therefore it must be fact]].

In some cases, two statements on the internet will appear contradict to each other. For example:
:*[[Jews did WTC]]
:*[[Islam]]ic people are all [[terrorist]]s because they planned [[9/11]]
This can easily be explained by the fact that [[Jews]] and [[Arab]]s are the same people but separated over what colour hats should be worn by the people who served at the Temple of Food in the promised land of Fuchal.
