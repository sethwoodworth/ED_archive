'''Amy Alkon''', also known as the [[drama queen|Advice Goddess]], writes an [[an_hero|advice]] column, ''Ask the Advice Goddess'', which is published in [[at least 100|at least 100]] newspapers within [[americunt|North America]].

For many years, Alkon gave [[blow_job|advice]] on the streets of [[New York City]] as one of three [[shemale|"women"]] who called themselves [[faggots|"The Advice Ladies."]]  She co-authored a book, ''Free Advice - You Get What You Pay For'' with them.  Before [[auto-fellatio|billing herself]] as the "advice godess", Alkon wrote ''Ask Amy Alkon'', an advice column published solely, oh really, [[furry|who gives a fuck?]]

In her daily life, and in her [http://www.advicegoddess.com/ag-columns-blog/newindex.html online blog], Alkon campaigns against [[niggas|SUVs]], [[niggas|bad parenting]], [[niggas|inconsiderate cellphone users]], [[jews|copyright violators]] and [[you|you]].

Amy Alkon is also a [[nazi|staunch atheist]]. She considers the eradication of the <s>Jew</s>"god delusion" to be an important goal for the [[genocide|betterment of society]]. Alkon maintains that the benefits of society often attributed to [[scientology|religion]] and innate human spirituality are better accounted for by evolution.

== Background ==

On [http://www.advicegoddess.com/archives/2008/08/13/is_it_racist_if.html August 13, 2008] a post appeared on Alkon's blog where Alkon called an [[crack|upstanding]] [[whore|woman's]] six children a "black person."  [[faggot|Failblog]], [[Sadly_no|Sadly, No!]], picked up on the post and made a passing [[troll|comment]].  Noticing that something was [[butthurt|amiss]], Alkon used [[tranny|"her"]] [[Internet_detective|internet detective]] skills to see [http://www.advicegoddess.com/archives/2008/08/15/wiki_tranny.html what else] was being said about her in the [[drama|tubes]] and noticed that [[100 years ago|2 weeks ago]] someone edited [[trap|"her"]] [[shit|Wikipedia entry]] for [[lulz|accuracy]].


== Ongoing ==

In a desperate effort to prove "she" is a [[no girls on the internet|she]], Alkon posted a [[2_girls_1_cup|photo of herself]] basking in a [[bukkake|cool breeze]].

While [[banhammer|facilitating discussion]] about critical [[me|issues]], Alkon also made an [http://www.advicegoddess.com/archives/2008/08/16/sadly_no.html#comments interesting observation]:
{{quote|The last two are from the same tiny little turd, this whois info:

I'm writing a book about this now -- about, among other things, people who have no self-control unless they're being watched. They think they're anonymous, and perhaps they are, so they behave in a way they never would if they were face to face and would be called on what they say.

This is the behavior of tiny weeny powerless functionaries during the day and week, whose only power is to grafitti on the wall here, absent the intellect to join the discussion, and the wherewithall, intellectually, to do it.}}

At this point it is unclear what [[idiot|Alkon]] has against [[Anonymous|Anonymous]].

Following Alkon's [[fail|attempts]] to post [[lawyer|personal information]] about the commenters on her site, she engaged in [[No_u|thoughtful discussion]], [[banhammer|embracing new users]], some of whom had visited the site for years. Users began accusing each other of being [[troll|"one of the vandals,"]] and Arthur Miller wrote a play about it. The users at [[faggots|Sadly, No!]] have begun to refer to any [[homosexual|site operator]] who becomes overly-defensive and paranoid as [[Wikipedia|"going Alkon."]]
