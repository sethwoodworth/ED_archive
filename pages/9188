Microsoft named their <s>new</s> ancient version of [[Windows]] (a convoluted port of [[apple]]'s "system 6.1") "XP", somehow discovering that the magic combination of those two letters instantly tickled some leftover reptilian part of the human brain and made any product more desirable.  From that point forward marketdroids around the world started naming everything XP, especially if it was high-tech.

In [[Netspeak]], XP makes something, anything, ''better''!
