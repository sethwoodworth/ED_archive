An online quiz is essentially the modern day version of the Oracle of Delphi. By answering a few seemingly unrelated questions, you can find out information about the deep, dark crevices of your personality. For those people unitiated into the world of psychobabble, this information is usually summarized into a fun form, such as:<br/><br/>

"You're a Shirley Temple!"<br/>
"You're a water angel!"<br/>
"You're Draco Malfoy!"<br/>
"Your kissing style is PASSIONATE!"<br/>
"You will most likely die from: too much masturbation!"<br/>
