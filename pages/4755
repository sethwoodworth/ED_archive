Lateral thinking is the term used for the process of changing the topic of [[Talk page | conversation]] to something [[Ann Coulter | surreal]] to disguise one’s [[own]] ignorance of the subject under discussion.

The [[phrase]] "lateral thinking" was [[coin]]ed by [[Al Gore |Edward de Bono]], a Malteser. Maltesers consist of a spherical malt [[food | honeycomb]]  centre, surrounded by [[milk]] [[chocolate]], and are designed to make [[fat]] people think that they are less fattening because they weigh less than a bar of lard [http://www.guardian.co.uk/notesandqueries/query/0,,-6315,00.html].

For example;<br>

''Q. An airplane crashes exactly on the border between Arizona and California. The two pilots and seven passengers are not identifiable in any way. How do public officials decide where to bury the survivors?''

''A. When you reread the question and realize it talks about burying "survivors," the answer is obvious: Only the Mojave Desert is remote enough to prevent anyone from hearing the tormented screams as dirt is shovelled onto their faces.''
