Galactic Federation of Light
[[Image:Blossom goodchild.jpg|thumb|Blossom prolly hangs out with [[Breatharian|Jasmuheen]]]]

It was predicted that on '''10/14/08, The Galactic Federation of Light''' would show up and rain nothing but [[cum|Pure Love]] down upon the [[you|writhing masses]] for 3 days. This [[True Believer|obviously correct]] prediction was [[lies|channeled]] by a [[lesbian|dykish]] [[fat]] [[Australian]] asperger named '''Blossom Goodchild'''. New Agers like [[Breatharian|Wiley Brooks]] turned into [[Trekkies]] and shat themselves in a fit of [[rapture]] because it was [[Unrealistic Expectations|actually going to happen this time]].  


==The Message==
[[Image:I want to believe.jpg|thumb|left|]]
Blossom Goodchild channeled a message from the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster|Galactic Federation of Light]], and it makes [[batshit|total sense]].

{{Quote |We wish it to be understood that on the 14th day of your month of October in the year 2008 a craft of great size shall be visible within your skies. It shall be in the south of your hemisphere and it shall scan over many of your states[http://www.blossomgoodchild.com/BGthemessage.html ... ] | -Blossom Goodchild posing as aliens}}

==Blossom Goodchild==
Blossom Goodchild is an Australian psychic, and [[No|was apparently an actress]] who, as a child, [[Yes|was believed to suffer]] from [[asspies]] and was [[rape|visited]] in her dreams by a tomahawk-throwing Injun by the name of Whitecloud. Up until her making her prediction that [[Flying Spaghetti Monster| Aliens]] would appear on 14/10/08, she was relatively unknown and had a following of around 200 [[Grammar|of whom she sent her initial prediction to in a]] email listing. Due to the overwhelming response by her [[retards|fans]], she decided to post "The Message" on [http://www.blossomgoodchild.com/ her website]. Due to her prediction, Goodchild was quickly gaining attention with the New Age movement and eventually had to make a recording to clarify the "facts" of her prediction.

This video propelled her into instant E-fame, out of this came two individuals came onto the stage prolly just trying to make some cash. The first individual is the [[canada|Canadant]] Brad Johnson. Brad Johnson created the website [http://www.10-14-08.blogspot.com 10-14-08] in an attempt to make himself an authority and make mad stackz of cash by littering the page with AdSense adds. He filled it with propaganda, fake images, articles, podcasts et cetera. Brad is basically a total douche who mocked the people he called "skeptics and naysayers" (those with common sense) in his podcasts and constantly reassured his sheep that {{Quote| It's going to happen guise|Brad}}

Here are some of the fine examples of propaganda that only a dumbfuck would fall for:

==Propaganda==

==10-14-08 blog==
Eventually after a while everything from normal occurrences such as earthquakes to abnormal things like power failures in Canada  were assumed to be cause by lightships and Brad would make a new post jizzing all over himself with excitement. These posts would be followed by [[at least 100]] comments from people telling brad to [[an hero]] or people jizzing just as much as him. Anywayz after a while users of 10-14-08 got bored and impatient and wouldn't stfu about whether or not the aliens would come so Brad decided to fawn after some fat [[batshit| psychic]] bitch who goes by the name Druanna on her jewtube account. Brad instantly got a raging boner and posted the videos to his blog (he blogs full time about something that isn't real) and shortly after becomes BFFs with Druanna in their delusional fantasy.

There was a chatbox on the blog for about two days, which was [[delete fucking everything|deleted]] when it was spammed with messages of the love of [[Xenu]] and how Brad is a paranoid [[faggot]]. During the week of the prediction, Brad would post anything emailed to him stating that it was the Galactic Federation of Light. This obviously led to [[shoop|shoops]] and tiny lights being posted on the blog with the title of "THEY'RE HERE! THEY'RE HERE!" only to be deleted shortly afterward when Brad was pwned in the comments section by people pointing out obvious [[This Looks Shopped|pixel deformities]].

Surprisingly Brad still runs the blog, which includes blurry pictures, shitty podcasts, and [http://10-14-08.blogspot.com/2008/10/confirmation-of-mars-civilization.html undeniable proof of Martian civilizations.] He still keeps the blank "Until 10-14-08" counter on the side of his blog.

==Blossom Goodchild Publicity==
Of course Blossom gets some publicity out of this

She is interviewed by Mike Quinsey and The Cosmic Eye but the youtube users have removed the videos due to [[butthurt]] however you can see the posts in the October archive of 10-14-08.

==FAIL==
<s>Brad Johnson announced on his blog that GUISE THE LIGHT SHIPS ARRIVED and all of the believers [[an hero]] and ascend.</s> NOTHING HAPPENED, [[Raelian|RaÃ«l]]'s truth has been vindicated once [[MOAR]] . But the [[True Believer]]s never say die. Just like always, these [[basement dweller|mouth-breathing]] dumbfucks quickly rationalized the incident, either by coming up with reasons the aliens never came or by claiming the [[FBI|feds]] are utilizing a [[Conspiracy|massive cover up scheme]]. The incident appears to have been erased from the New Age hivemind, as they have turned their focus on a less ambitious occurrence that happens once a year, 11/11. <small>'''(OMG ITZ ALL ONES!!!1!!WAT A MAGICAL COSMOLOGICAL EVENT!!1!!one)'''</small>

==What if they really did come?==
