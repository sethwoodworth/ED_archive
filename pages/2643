[[File:Emma Jones.jpg|right|frame|Arabian jail... or [[an hero|some other way out]]??]]

'''Emma Jones''' was once your average [[British]] [[woman]] in the [[Middle East]]: [[asking for it|prim]], [[asking for it|proper]], and forever maintaining the necessary degree of vigilance lest an unwashed Arab grab her kicking and screaming off the street for a little international [[surprise sex]]. Employed in the noble (if futile) practice of trying to [[English motherfucker do you speak it|teach Arab childen to speak English]] rather than their godless jib-jab [[moonspeak]], the twenty-four year old seemed to be making the best of a bad situation in '''Abu Dhabi'''... right up to the point where one of her co-workers searched for her on [[Failbook]].

Little did Emma Jones know, she was about to be ''trolled to death''.

==N00ds? In MY United Arab Emirates?==

It seems that before she got on a plane to Camelsville, Emma had [[breaking up|broken up]] with [[CSIII|IT consultant]] Jamie Brayley. Being a [[basement dweller|responsible grown-up]], Jamie reacted with what would usually be an unremarkable response [[Cockblocked|for a man in his position]]: upload all the [[noods]] of his ex that he could get his hands on to [[The Internets]], specifically Facebook.

When [[pwnt]] in this manner, most [[women]] go down the same predictable route: first [[BAWWWWWW]], then a botched attempt at [[DMCA]], followed by allegations that the ex [[almost raped]] them, and finally, acceptance that they have been [[kitchen|put in their rightful place]]. Given that she was in [[Saudi Arabia|Dubai]], however, made the whole thing more [[awesome|dangerous]] for Emma Jones, because [[Muslim]] countries tend to [[prison|take a more old-fashioned attitude to these sorts of things]].

==How do I avoided jail?==

The images were brought to young Emma's attention at work one day, when a colleague casually stuffed a handfull of [[Jew gold]] down her blouse and enquired about the going rate for a [[blowjob|blowjorb]]. Because the only women in Sandniggerland who ''have'' anything under their burkas are [[prostitute]]s ([[lolwut|right?]]), the mere existance of n00ds makes one a whore under UAE law! The punishment? Well, [[rape]], obviously; and then prison. Undoubtedly followed by a lot moar rape.

She couldn't flee the country, because Abu Dhabi's [[cops|1337 camel-mounted police force]] would surely have it as [[USI|top priority to hunt her down and stop her]] at the airport. What other choice, then? A [[man|sensible person]] might have calmed down, and decided that ''at worst'' a jaunt to the embassy to consult an [[attorney at lol]] may have been in order. But no. The chick decided that the best solution was a [[final solution|final one]], and chugged a bottle of drain cleaner.

==What did we learn, children?==

Sadly, this means the sandnigger children ''will not'' [[English is not my native language|learn to English]]. But for [[you|the average slovenly netzian]], there is at least one time-honoured lesson to be derived from this moderately lulzy episode:
