'''''[http://questionablecontent.net/index.php Questionable Content]''''' is a [[webcomic]] for [[indie]] music whores who read ''[[Pitchfork]]'' and cum-guzzling [[hipster]] [[sheep]] who infest the [[college]] atmosphere of the [[United States]] and the rest of the [[Europe|developed world]], trying to act as experts on [[music]] despite the fact that outside what ''Pitchfork'' tells them, they actually know little about music. And just like the name says, its content is indeed questionable. Drawn by [[nobody cares|Jeph Jacques]], this comic has been around since like [[shit nobody cares about|2004 or something]], but now it has a load of guest strips because he's too [[lazy]] to draw new comics every day, despite the fact that he makes his career out of this webcomic. Jacques is also [[Wikipedia:Jeph Jacques|notable]] enough for his own [[article]] on Wikipedia separate from his webcomic,  [[unwarranted_self-importance|strangely enough]].

[[Wikipedia:Questionable Content|Wikipedia describes]] ''Questionable Content'' as a "[[porn|slice-of-life webcomic]]", and true to this description, it often features [[love]] stories and intimate [[sex]]ual situations where these [[androgynous]] hipster [[fags]], like the [[loser|main character]] [[Mary_sue|Marten]] and his [[girlfriend]] (is it [[girlvinyl|Dora]]? Is it someone else? It [[slut|changes so much]] that it's hard to remember) talk [[bullshit]] about music any try to outsmart each other in terms of their [[shit nobody cares about|musical knowledge]], which is [[retarded]] as surely anyone with half a brain would just [[grawp|want to have sex]] rather than embarrass themselves by attempting to outsmart [[Mark Prindle]] whilst approaching [[orgasm]]. Note that the males in this comic are pretty much indistinguishable from the females due to their long hair and feminine features. It's also [[racist]] as it only features [[white people]].

==Questionable Content - The Webcomic==
''Questionable Content'' actually started in like 2003, around the same time as [[4chan]] started, which makes it very, very [[old]], so it's been going for around five years now as of the time of writing. Although it's [[amnesia|difficult to recall]], the first strip with its crappy drawing features a [[ronery]] Marten coming home to his pet [[robot]] [[computer]], Pintsize, who downloads [[porn]] for him. Soon afterwards, however, he is joined by some [[girl]] called Faye who comes to live with him because she is [[hobo|homeless]]. Other characters are introduced and removed (early character Sara was eaten alive by a [[dinosaur]] according to the comic's author as he wanted to kill her off as she was [[boring]]). The comic features more [[women]] than it does [[men]], to cater for the [[fapping]] needs of the stupid hipster [[cunt]]s who read it and think that Mogwai and Mercury Rev are the pinnacles of music without realizing that outside of their little circle of [[teenagers|young people]], [[nobody cares]] about these bands. The characters are drawn extremely realistically these days for this reason, and are read to suppress the sexual and romantic fantasies of [[fat]] college kids of both genders who can't get laid (except with other fatties) but would like to think about doing so.  It is [[internet_famous|notable]] for being a popular [[webcomic]] by an [[weeaboo|"artist"]] with absolutely no knowledge of or facility with pacing, acting, framing, dialogue, or [[shit_nobody_cares_about|any of the rudiments necessary to make a comic readable]].

To fit with the [[unrealistic expectations|themes]] of the young, [[intellectual]], [[cool]] successful irreverent apathetic detached people who are known to everyone else as hipsters (although of course they themselves are in [[denial]] that they are hipsters, [[obvious]]ly) there's constant namedropping of shit bands, movies, writers, poets, philosophers, etcetera. This is because trying to look cool is the only way for them to get around the fact that none of them [[NORP|have a real job]] and are part of the privileged few who are not taking for granted that they were not born [[the child in Africa]].

It's possible that Jacques is a closet [[B|/b/tard]], as many of his comics make references to numerous memes (including [[over 9000]] and [[mudkips]]) and he actually mentions [[4chan]] in one episode. He has also recently created a character who is an obvious /b/tard â€” she talks about [[raids]], is obsessed with manga, and has poor personal hygiene habits, all of which fit the stereotype of someone who spends their time on [[B|/b/]], [[no girls on the internet|except her gender, which negates every other piece of evidence]]. Then, of course, there is PintSize....the robot who is 4chan personified.

Were someone who was not [[gay]] or a [[hipster]] to attempt reading this [[lies|truly inspiring example of character development coupled with an excellent story]], they would likely [[shit bricks]] at the realization that all of the characters are the exact same person. This is [[fail|unfortunately not]] [[common knowledge]], as the [[Jews]] have been covering this up while also pretending the [[holocaust]] actually took place.

==[[Indie]] [[Tits]]==
To further his [[fail|ends]], Jeph Jacques also maintains [http://www.indietits.com/ another webcomic], called ''[[Tits or GTFO|Indie]] [[YOU'RE A BIRD!|Tits]]''. Basically, it features two birds talking to each other about moar hipster bullshit. It's rather [[unfunny]], and it is thought that Jeph Jacques only draws it because he can't think of enough storyline for the steamy, sweaty [[drama]] that permeates ''Questionable Content''.
