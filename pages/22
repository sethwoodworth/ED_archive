/k/
Welcome to the only board on [[4chan]] where you can't say "black person!"

'''/k/''' (also known among [http://www.pinkpistols.org/ Pink Pistols] members as '''Special K''') is the weapons board on 4chan where [[paranoid]], [[Stormfront|socially retarded]] [[redneck|rednecks]] and FPS fapping [[13-year-old boy|13-year-old]] fun boys gather to discuss [[Gun|firearms]], [[ATHF_Terrorist_Attack|bombs]] and how to assassinate [[Boss Nigger|Obama]]. All /k/-users call themselves /k/ommandos and are correct in thinking that Jew can be [[Holocaust|solved]] if everybody carried weapons. The only thing besides the [[:Image:1911.jpg|M1911]] that makes a /k/ommando wet is the thought of [[R. Lee Ermey]] screaming obscenities at them, while they defend their [[fail|mobile homes]] from IRS agents with armor-piercing munitions and claymore mines. They also believe that the [[2012|end is near]] and the only way to prepare for it is to grow a [[neckbeard]], stop taking showers, [[Survivalist|move away from society]] into a camouflaged shed in the middle of nowhere, booby trap the entire compound and shoot anybody who looks at them <del>funny</del> period.

/k/ Is by far the easiest board to troll on 4chan. This is due to the high concentration of underage b& who post there. You see, teenage boys are physically incapable of ignoring trolls, which they perceive to be a direct threat to their E-penis'. ''Every'' troll is a successful troll on /k/ because the hormonally charged teenagers there believe that /k/ is serious fucking business. Compounding the problem is that there are large numbers of teenage boys from both the USA and Europe, which leads to countless threads about which country is better, usually devolving into the classic "I could kick your ass if I really wanted to" style posturing innate to 13 year olds.

==Demographics of /k/==
[[Image:Mantrain2.jpg|thumb|left|/k/ summed up in a single picture.]]
{{quote|He's intelligent, but an under-achiever; alienated from his parents; has few friends. Classic case for recruitment by the Soviets. | - Description of a typical /k/ommando}}
*'''The [[batshit crazy]] libertarian''' - The majority of /k/ is comprised of this demographic. The libertarians on /k/ are young Ted Kaczynski's, who believe that "the gubmint is gonna take our guns n' put us all in FEMA camps." One of the most common topics discussed by them is how to kill [[Partyvan|feds]], black people, and [[Jews|ZOG]]. Another common topic is what to do in the event of an emergency, the answer to which is, invariably, "I'mma git mah SKS n' go inna woods." The libertarians of /k/ usually believe that [[9/11]] was the work of the US government, as part of a conspiracy to take away their rights and let niggers rule the country; they're not exactly sure about the details, but it's something like that anyway. The libertarians of /k/ may or may not own real guns- it mostly depends on whether or not the /k/ommando in question is 18 years old yet, and if his mother will allow him to keep guns in the basement.
*'''The [[Eurofag]]''' - These pansies visit /k/ for the sole purpose of trolling the Americans there. Since Europe is made up of either [[Scandinavia|communist nanny states]] or [[UK|totalitarian police states]], these guys cannot own firearms. So they make up for their lack of [[Pingas]] compensators by trolling /k/, collecting images of weapons, and buying (licensed) [[Plastic_crap|airshit]]. Despite the fact that the typical Eurofag does not have any firearms or any experience, thus not knowing shit, they are the most dogmatic and stubborn debaters when it comes to weapon systems and calibers. The Eurofag is jealous of USA and will take every opportunity to whine, [[butthurt|bitch and moan]] about [[Unwarranted_self_importance|american ways]] and [[george_bush|politics]] and will [[Liberal|celebrate and cherish every US casualty]]. They are common carriers of the [[AIDS]].
*'''The [[Australian]]''' - The sad puppy dogs of /k/. They desperately want to own guns like the Americans can, but due to their [[Kevin Rudd|communist government's]] policies, they are not allowed to. Australians typically post threads bragging about their .22 LR Ruger that they have to keep locked up at the firing range, or asking how they can buy a gun in Australia. No matter what they post about though, the thread will swiftly fill up with [[Josef Fritzl]] memes and jokes about how much Australia fails.
*'''The [[American|Gun Owner]]''' An elusive creature, often compared to Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. It is hotly debated whether any gun owners actually exist on /k/. [[Some argue]] that there once were gun owners on /k/, but they were driven out by tripfags, [[13_year_old_boys|teenage boys]], and the assorted other forms of cancer which now dominate the board. So far, there is no conclusive evidence to prove their existence, and most experts dismiss them as mythological creatures, yet sightings continue to occur every so often. The search continues.

[[Image:Duke Nukem Exposed.jpg|thumb|right|In ur thread, hating ur gunz.]]
==Chemo==
In early March [[2010]], moot awoke from his soup fueled stupor and realized that /k/ was quickly becoming just as cancerous as /x/. His solution? A Nazi mod. Immediately upon assuming control, the new mod began banning all of the [[Stormfront|Stormfags]] and trolls who were killing /k/. At 07:40 GMT the entire front page of /k/ was weapons related, for the first time in 2 years. The regulars of /k/ were pleased and started to [[buttsex|become receptive]] to the new mod. This behavior continued only until the mod was done with the cancer and started banning people for the black person word, [[picture_unrelated|not weapon-related OP pics]], [[homophobia|homophobic]] posts and anything fun in general, in an attempt to transform /k/ into a second [[unfunny|Arfcom]]. The displeasure reached the top when the mod failed miserably to stop the [[cancer|/b/ raid]] and /k/ was flooded with cameras, tripods and fierce flamewars in reaction to a recently released video of [[army|Apache pilots]] [[winrar|pwning]] a bunch of [[arab|sand niggers]]. <s>The mod has been [[too_lazy|busy]] ever since and his only real [[vandalism|contribution]] to the board remains the ban of [[troll|Svet's]] tripcode and wordfilter on the black person word.</s> The mod has returned, more totalitarian as ever, in an effort to turn /k/ into [[OPERATORchan|OPchan]].

==Notable Tripfags==
Just like any 4chan specialty board, /k/ has it's own army of insufferable, bullshitting tripfags who always ruin everything.

{{co|TPB|[GRAB UR SKS AND GO INNA WOODS]|[That gun is shit. Buy a good gun instead.]|0|

===[[troll|The /k/ommando]]===
A poster on /k/ who actually owns a machine gun and a suppressor. As one of the few class III owners on /k/, he is a total dick to those he regards as lowly hobbyists. He is sure to point out how lame semi automatic rifles are when you could have spent the extra $10,000 on a full auto. His trip alone, referring to himself as '''the''' /k/ommando alone reflects a fair amount of faggotry.

===[[Duke Nukem]]===
[[Image:Dukenukemnigger.jpg|100px|left]]
[[Image:SHITFAN.jpg|frameless|160px|right|OH SHI-â€Ž]]
Duke Nukem was the biggest, baddest, most famous tripfag of /k/.  All feared and worshiped him. Then, on a night like any other, somebody cracked his poor password of a tripcode, [[Asking for it|##nigger]]. The /k/ommandos decided on this night to take the [[samefag|samefaggotry]] to a whole new level, causing Duke to [[Butthurt|RAGE]] and hopefully become an hero. And nothing of value was lost. Also he claims every gun is shit, but deep down inside he loves them all.{{clear}} Is currently MIA.

===[[Weeaboo]] Crew===
These work as a team to spread fail and [[AIDS]] to all.  

====[[Touhou|Marisa Kirisame]]====
A [[weeaboo]] [[basement dweller]] who [[80 year old Chinese man in panties|RPs]] as a animu witch girl and trolls /k/ by simply existing. His [[Pingas]] is most likely microscopic, like most [[azn|asians]].  His love for the Five-seveN is unnatural and possibly illegal in all 50 states.  Once left /k/ "for good" and returned the next morning under a different name.  When called out on it by [[troll|Pervasive Fagrant]], he switched back to his old name.

====Kagami====
Another [[weeaboo]] who claims to be a girl.  Shitposts all day and then complains that nobody likes him. Confirmed to be a nigger.

====Arcueid Brunested====
The [[weeaboo]] who started the trend.  He bears responsibility for the entire plague of [[faggots]].

===[[Faggot|Anthraxinsoup]]===
A [[faggot]] who claims to attend the [[college|The air force academy]] and goes on /k/ just to treat /k/ as LiveJournal and shitpost intentionally. He posted pictures of his cock with bullets shoved in his cock hole, which is rare for a tripfag. He claims to be soon married to his [[boyfriend|girlfriend]], which means he will lose all sex expect for when his wife wants a baby (although he shouldn't be allowed to have kids). He likes to brag about how he is attending the air force academy, is getting married, owns guns, will be a [[basement dweller|CRO]], is going for pre-med, going the pharmacy school, getting a 29 on his ACT, becoming a colonel, pharmacist, doctor, lawyer, and politician. He also hated and [[Internet_Tough_Guy|battled]] the [[fag]] that was [[emo|XxXEmofagXxX]], something that he has done right for once.
Some quotes about him and his communism:
EDIT- No one has any quotes about him, or even knows who he is. He just decided to add some made up shit to his already enormous auto-biography here. No one writes this much about a unknown tripfag.
Note that Anthraxinsoup is a massive [[butthurt]] [[atheist]] [[faggot]] who will start [[shit]] threads on [[K/|/k/]] about how [[butthurt]] [[God]] makes him.

===S.T.A.L.K.E.R.===
A pussy who washed out of boot camp but talks like he's a 30 year veteran OPERATOR, and claims to be both a Marine and a Veteran of the Armed Forces. If you ever see a post speaking of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. in a positive light, it is him samefagging as an anon. He does this to put off the illusion that anyone ever agrees with him/he isn't a cockmongling dropout. He also frequently changes his description on this page in the hopes of making people believe he's not a faggot. The only tripfaggot for whom the mods will get off their asses to ban.

===Phil Ossiferz Stone===
A Fudd who spends his time complaining about racism on /k/ and then posts anti-black person rants.  Tells other people to buy bolt-action rifles for home defense in between posting [[Playboy]] scans from the 1980s.  He recently ordered a DVD set of gun training for [[Faggot|homosexuals]] and then teased the whole board with it and refused to torrent it. He decided to show it on a web streaming service but deleted his account after few [[troll|/k/lansmen]] threatened to report him for copyright violations.

===M1A Girl===
An annoying and pretentious [[attention whore]] that's substituting her lack of [[tits]] (she sports a pair of A-cup ''invisitits'') and social life (she has no [[man]]) with guns and with trolling [[virgins]] on [[/k/]]. She spends all her money on guns instead of on makeup, cooking books and [[Kitchen|kitchenware]]. It is widely assumed that her hate of men and her extreme [[penis envy]] (which she compensates with guns)  was the result of her fundamentalist [[Religion|religious]] upbringing and possibly [[Incest|sexual child abuse]]. She was banned but has unfortunately reappeared.

===Get Some===
A [[Canada|Canadian]] who was in the [[shit|Canadian military]].  He loves the [[Gun#M16|AR-15]] more than life itself.  If you are enough of a massive faggot to want to buy that jamtastic piece of shit you should talk to him.

===[[asspie|Pervasive Vagrant]]===
An [[Asspie]].  Used to go by OP, in order to be a [[faggot|funny guy]] and make himself believe that people actually wanted to hold a conversation with him and not the Original Poster of the thread.  Was later banned for [[Faggotry|pervasive vagrancy]], which is how he got the new name.  He gets [[alcohol|drunk]], by himself, on nearly every Friday and Saturday in hopes of forgetting his total lack of friends. He then posts rambling threads on /k/ in hopes of filling the social void in his life.  Often [[butthurt|rages]] at [[shit|politics threads]] in [[/k/]] (despite the fact that for more than a year he himself spammed /k/ with /b/ memes, combos, and other utterly unrelated shit,) at being called out on the fact that his guns are Jew [[shit|surplus]], and at being called a fat asspie.  Gets all of his [[lies|info]] from [[Google]] and [[Wikipedia]]. Calling him out on his [[bullshit|opinions]] and asking for a valid source will either result in him ignoring the post or completely leaving the thread.

===CanadaGoose===
A total pain in the ass. Started posting in early 2010, though claims to have lurked /k/ for years. Also reported to be a former /b/tard. A [[douchebag]] that claims to know everything about camping and survival but in fact doesn't know shit. He has been spotted editing his info on the /k/ article of ED.

===Vojnik===
A [[old|40-something]] [[Muslim]] [[terrorist]] from [[Bosnia]] who currently resides in the USA. He claims to have [[killer|killed]] people in combat during the [[Yugoslavia|1992 Bosnian War]], but obviously didn't. All he does is post shitty [[webcam|livelink]] movies and changes his ED info. What a faggot.

===[[faggot|BOOF]]===
A [[fat]] [[old]] [[pedophile|loser]] who spends way too much time on 4Chan. Claims to be the best tripfag on /k/, and often [[samefag]]s with various replies to bolster this pseudo-reputation. Any thread with [[faggot|BOOF]] in it will often be accompanied by [[dildo|BOOF]] samefagging such quotes as "[[dickhead|BOOF]] IS SO GREAT" and "[[cunt|BOOF]] IS THE BEST" and "I LOVE [[aids|BOOF]]". Justifies his [[liar|self-propagated myth]] by spamming /k/ with his [[fail|shitty threads]] on a near daily basis. Unfortunately 99.999999% of them are nothing more than [[shit|"HEY GUISE WATCH ME STRIP THIS SHITTY OLD GUN THAT NO ONE OWNS OR CARES ABOUT WHILE I BUMP THIS SHIT THREAD TO PAGE 1 FOR THE NEXT 10 HOURS WITH MASSIVE BLURRY PHOTOS"]]. black person.

===ZUN===
God amongst trolls. Hails from a tiny island of chinkapork and is the anti-troll of [[Malaysia]] trolls. Does not post anything related to weapons at all except for the Singaporean Army. Also made Marisa suck his tiny asian penis on MSN for hentai and then posted the chatlog on /k/. Marisa got butthurt over it and /k/ommandos can finally counter troll Marisa just by posting the chatlog. He also is ''looking after'' a delectable little loli.

Doesn't post in /k/ anymore and is seen in /int/.

===Svet===
[[File:Svet_mouth.jpg|75px|right]]
A guy pretending to be a young, attractive, female veteran of the Iraq War. /k/ eventually discovered that he was mining the Facebook page of one Melissa Martin (an 18 year old [[loser|pothead]] from Iowa) for pics. In a glorious act of [[great_justice|justice]], Svet was [[permab&]] from /k/ by moot, now posts simply as two trips: "!AP6PiIKnos!!SpMxCIWJzZd".

===[[faggot|LegalMumboJumbo]]===

[[Image:legal_derp.jpg|thumb|left|Before his hair got fed up with his lies/bullshit and left.]]

Imagine if you were a balding 23 year old who lived at home, had no education and no job. Imagine that your mommy and daddy pandered to you like a child, and you still sounded like one. Imagine that you were still a virgin and that you had the body of a pudgy 14 year old. Imagine that you knew absolutely nothing about weapons, but were an obsessive radio hobbyist who spent his entire high school career dicking about making friends with truckers and the drive-thru people at McDonalds. Imagine that you are a four-eyed loser with a face that not even a mother could love. Imagine that you had no prospects, but a horribly over-inflated sense of self-importance and narcissistic tendencies rivaled only by Charles Manson. Imagine that you had no friends and no girl had ever shown the slightest interest in you. Imagine that you were plagued with crippling loneliness and depression, and your only coping mechanism was denial.

Now imagine that you stumbled across this website called 4Chan that lets you post Anonymously, even with a name, where you can claim anything and everything without having to provide any proof. A place where you are guaranteed attention, even if you don't belong and only cause problems.

Apart from being all of the aforementioned, he is a notorious [[samefag]]. His favourite M.O. is to create a thread asking for general information on one of the few limited subjects he believes he has some knowledge of, then filling said thread with his own replies. This is an attempt to create the illusion that he contributes something to /k/, but it is very transparent and never fools anyone. He is considered by many to be the worst tripfag in the history of /k/ (that's right kids, even worse than Douk or Marisa). <s>Much</s> all of the time these threads will be ripe with images, either pictures of his father's guns (because he doesn't own any because he's a niggerfaggot) or images pilfered from a website used by people who actually own guns. 

Famous [[samefag|LMJ]] quotes:

{{quote| Yet we still find swords, forged by cavemen. Hmmm. | - on why stainless steel is a bad choice for knives}}

{{quote| Broseph, I was 5'7" 135lbs in Highschool. I played officiated Ice Hockey, played paintball competetively, and was well liked by everyone. To this day I'm still friends with a majority of my graduating class. | - on how he's awesome and popular and athletic}}

{{quote| Milling marks everywhere, very loose tolerances, OBVIOUS COPY OF THE COLT 1911A1 but with a lot of "liberties" taken...I'm sure if they were new, there'd be burrs on the metal. | - on the subject of the Tokarev TT-33}}

{{quote| I post zero copypasta or misinformation. I'm rather well liked here by board contributors. | - stroking his own massive ego}}

<center><youtube>ud7sWM-7yA8</youtube></center>
{{quote|He brings new meaning to the phrase "Nasally, whiney nerd"| - Anonymous}}

{{quote| LMJ is the last of the holdout tripshitposters, a relic of a time when shitposting and tripfagging were synonymous. He's coasting on his reputation now. Knowing his reputation is nothing on /k/, he posts superficially /k/ related threads, knowing his very presence will provoke scorn and abuse, which is the only DELISHUS ATTENSHUN he can get. Don't forget your sage, kids. | - Anonymous}}

===black person===
A nigger from Africa that ventured to the U.S. to find a cure for AIDS that was given to him by his nigger back in Africa. Only posts on /k/ to show off his shitty Glock and radio in attempts to increase his penis size so that he can match the penis size of the nigger waiting for him back in Africa. His EDC consists of an African passport and African money. It is rumored that this reminds SA Operator of the nigger that is waiting for him back in Africa and that motivates him to keep finding cure for AIDS. Got b& for being a faggot. Famous for LMJ dicksucking because LMJ is the only tripfag more hated than him and will take whatever he can get.

===[[faggot|SIGfag]]===
A self-righteous and arrogant homosexual from Switzerland who admits this fact in his own trip. Attempts crude trolling techniques which consist of posting a series of expensive gun photos stolen from various online forums and claiming them as his own. He claims to own thousands of dollars worth of class III weapons and machine guns with a SIG 551 being his center piece. This has obviously never been substantiated and can thus this grotesquely stupid trip can be brushed off as a local idiot waving his penis at oncoming traffic in a futile attempt at attention-whoring. Among his deluded rants, he states that handguns are worthless and that a 40-pound 4-foot DP-28 machine gun makes a superb CQB weapon. Is believed to be S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

==/k/ on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]==
[[Image:Ksfavoritecouple.jpg|thumb|Some ragefap material for the fags on /k/.  No need to thank us, we can hear you grunting from here.]]
It has already been repeatedly established that /k/ is the easiest board to [[troll]] on 4chan and probably the entire internet.  The simplest way to do so of course is to suggest that there may currently be a [[woman]] / [[black person]] / [[homosexual]] browsing /k/ or that at one point in time there was one.

But here on [[ED]] is where the true displays of immaturity can be found.  Simply by checking the [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=/k/&action=history history of the page] can you see the amount of [[VIP|vandalism]] the [[Fag|big strong manly man]] [[internet tough guys]] of /k/ sour the page with.  [[Butthurt]] is the main import of ED but on this page it really shines.  

Even more amazing is that all the vandalism suggests that there are people from /k/ that can actually read.  Though it is possible their mothers are reading it to them while changing their diapers.
