==General Guidelines==

# The Church of Scientology is our enemy, but we must respect individual members. 
# Keep a level head and don't do anything rash.  
# Respect police officers and city officials. They are on our side, let's not change that.
# For fuck sake don't bring any weapons.  Bring cake (it's Elron's birthday party after all).
# Bring your mask/ disguise because those pedo scifags liek to take pics of you.  
# Remember Anonymous is AGAINST THE CHURCH NOT THE RELIGION! Scientology members should be informed about FREEZONE Scientology!
# Be prepared to handle any defectors.  Disillusioned followers of the Church of Scientology are our biggest supporters and best PR.
# Beware infiltration by the Enemy and their icecream vans.  
# Pass out information about the Co$ wrongful tax exempt status where relevant (USA, Spain, Sweden, Australia, ???)

== '''SLOGANS''' ==


THEY'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY ''AND'' YOUR LIFE

THE VULTURE MINISTRY 
This refers to the Enemy's illegal and deplorable practice of invading disaster sites such as 9/11 and even hospitals to sell Scientology to victims.  A German politician said about them: 'Where there is carrion the Vultures gather'.

CoS: THE CHURCH OF THE DOUBLE CROSS 
The deleted cross emblem was devised by Alastair Macgregor Crowley a wannabee demonist.

LRH: THE ORIGINAL SP

FREE TOM CRUISE!!

SOUL HACKERS!

KSW- No! SSW- Yes!  [Keep Scientology Working  Stop Scientology Working]



==Bomb threats against CoS?==
According to one ED poster, several threats have been made against various $cientology locations, including "bomb threats, letters with white powder mailed to orgs, ect." These claims, regardless of whether any letters containing white powder ever existed, are a clear example of sci-fag psy-ops. If contacted by your local police about any supposed bomb threats, you should be cooperative and actively work with them in finding out who was responsible. 
<br /><br />
The original poster who brought up this issue further stated that "The people who have contacted the police for the FEB 10th raid to get permits and help organize are being held responsible for these threats, because they have chosen to reveal their names to the public. IF you have ANY information WHATSOEVER regarding these threats, please email (ADDRESS REDACTED), so that these reports can be compiled into a report of the authorities."
<br /><br />
Note that having one central report of possible non-anon-like activity is completely useless, and violates the rule of DECENTRALIZATION. It is quite possible the "bomb threats" entry on ED was itself created by a sci-fag, and there is nothing to worry about. Still, you should be prepared to talk with police about our nonviolent tactics, and if by chance you DO hear of anon mailing bomb threats, please, by all means turn them in.
