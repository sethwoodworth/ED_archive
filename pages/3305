'''Get on [[IRC]] [[fgt]]''' is a [[forced meme]] by [[Sheneequa]], who is a lonely and [[fat]] nigress who forces memes like this and runs her own IRC channels to [[Mental disorder|gain some sense of control]] in her [[shit]] excuse for [[life]]. 

It is pretty easy, just get an irc client (google it if you need to) and type /server <s>irc.encyclopediadramatica.com</s> [[IRC#Anonymuncule|irc.anonymuncule.com]] and then /join #channel where channel is one of your lovely choices below.

==Rooms==
There are several options for your [[goatse|ass raping]] pleasure on ED IRC. The following is a rough description of what to expect when your faggot ass gets on IRC.

===#ed===
[[Image:NormalChat.jpg|thumb|[[lies|How to be awesome on ED IRC.]]]]
[[File:ED IRC final moments.JPG|thumb|[[ED:Address_to_the_State|Memories]]]]
[[ED IRC etiquette|ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER IN.]] You'll need to don your thickest skin if you want to survive in here. '''#ed''' is for the [[faggots|ED community]] at large and [[fanbois|lurkers]] who don't necessarily edit but have taken the [[ED Oath of Allegiance]] and want to discuss drugs, [[pedophiles]], [[Jews]], [[Woody_Allen|pedophile Jews]] and drugging Jews to further the destruction of the Zionist agenda and the establishment of a Palestinian state. And [[Snus]].

===#wp80===
For users of sister wiki [[Whatport80]]. '''<b>[[No Cussing Club|NO F*CKING CUSSING P*SSY]]</b>'''.

===#forum===
Second only to #ed in its user count and #1 for channel activity, '''#forum''' is where all the [[ED Forums|EDF]] [[Retard|cool kids]] hang out and circle-jerk to each other and talk about [[drama|pressing matters]]. Epic threads, and more importantly, homosexual lolcows who use the forums as their fucking [[Twitter]], hit on the ops, and the general autism of the EDFaggots are also discussed on a frequent basis. [[You|No fatties allowed]].

===#wiki===
'''#wiki''' is for ED [[SFB]] only. This room is a [[lie|drama and faggotry free zone]] for [[EDiots]] and [[Dramacrats]] who want to talk about [[Shit nobody cares about|ED stuff]]. Anyone who edits ED is welcome to drop in for assistance, to make suggestions, and [[nobody cares|bitch about other users]].  At the moment #wiki is lacking in its amount of users. If you are an EDitor, a new user who finds [[Template:Ircwiki|this]] on your talk page, or you create a new article, please get your pimply ass on IRC and do something useful with your worthless life.  Remember, ED > [[IRL]].  Articles/areas and their appropriate links that we would like to see improvement on are typically listed in the channel's topic for your convenience.  You can help contribute to front page worthy articles and feel [[Unwarranted Self Importance|important.]]

===#trivia===
For all discussion concerning horrific baby names, dog breeds and Billy Joel.

===#sysop===
Kool Kidz Klub. No darkies allowed.

==A Few Pointers==
[[Image:Hazmat kiddie pool.jpg|thumb|250px|Yes, the kiddie pool is open again.]]
{{squote| The way to learn some is to get [[banned]] and learn your lesson. I get banned alot,usually by [[user:ajt|ajt]] or [[user:weev|weev]]. I have learned to not fuck with weev, EVAR.That means no talking about personal life and shit unless you really get to know him and can have a dozen conversations without him banning you. Same rule applies to ajt too; he has been banning me alot and will [[perma-ban]] you without warning. Just wait it out until morning and get on by another computer and ask [[eppigy]] to [[unban]] you (he is always on). Oh yeah be poliet about it too and don't talk when the person who previously banned you is having a conversation unless you can usefully contribute to the conversation. Don't ask questions instead use the power of the internet to find answers. Also don't ever talk about [[chans]] unless a [[Special:listAdmins|Sysop]] has brought up the topic (discussion of [[anontalk]] is forbidden). There is really no way to prevent being banned when ajt confronts you on something; he bans you, period. That is all I have for you right now.}}

==Topics For Discussion==
[[Image:Lolflood.jpg|thumb|175px|A [[normal]] evening in ED IRC]]

While on ED IRC, pay attention to the channel's topic.  The topic should appear to you when you first open the channel up or in your IRC client's status bar.  Usually, the topic of the channel is very pertinent to what is going on at that particular moment at Encyclopedia Dramatica and can often be [[:Image:Normalircday.jpg|very insightful to the conversation that you are about to enter]]. Topics range from very [[Girugamesh|funny items found on the internet]] all the way to [[Banhammer|how to get help with some code on an article.]]  Typical topics you will find:
*'''[[Drugs]]'''
*'''[[Jews]]'''
*'''[[JEWS DID WTC|Drugs and Jews]]'''
*'''[[ED:QOTN|Winning quotes]]'''
*'''[[Unrealistic expectations|Finding true love]]'''
*'''[[Crazyconan|Quitting IRC]]'''
*'''[[BURK|Being made fun of for your hairstyle]]'''

==mIRC Encyclopedia Dramatica Search Script==
If you use [[mIRC]] for your IRC client - and about 99% of the internet does - this little snippet of [[code]] can be a very valuable tool for your IRC experience and can also be a very fun part of learning some coding for the program, if you are into that stuff.
#Open mIRC's script editor and click on the "Remotes" tab. <br> 
#Make a new mIRC remote by clicking on "File" and then "New."  You should be presented with a blank text area to edit in.<br>
#Paste this line in the new remote:<br><nowiki>alias end { if ($1) { url $+(http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Special:Search?search=,$1-) } }</nowiki><br>
#Save that Remote as whatever you want, but make sure it ends in '''.mrc''' also make sure it is someplace in your mIRC folder.<br>
#Load the remote by clicking on "file" again and then "load."  Find your recently saved .mrc file and click that.  The ED search script is now loaded.<br>
#To use, type '''/end (your search terms)''' in any mIRC channel or status window you have.  The script will locate your search query and open the page in your default [[browser]].  
::Example:  '''/end raspberry rush''' will take you to this page: [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Raspberry_Rush http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Raspberry_Rush]<br>

==Yet Another Encyclopedia Dramatica Script For mIRC==
[[File:EDscriptsearcher.jpg|thumb|Just what the hell is this thing doing?]]
This script searches encyclopediadramatica.com for your search item. If no search word is given, it will give results from a random word.

Syntax for the script is !dramatica search word(s) or just plain !dramatica for random.

There is a ! trigger that will notice the user and a @ trigger that will message the channel if the user has halfops or higher.
