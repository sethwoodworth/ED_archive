'''[http://rateyourmusic.com/ Rate Your Music]''', [[loev|affectionately]] known as '''RYM''', is a website where [[indiefucks]], [[Heavy Metal|metal]]heads and [[Soulseek]] users go to, [[obvious|well]], rate their music. It was founded by a [[Muslim]] immigrant to Seattle on [[Christmas]] Day [[millennium bug|2000]] after being inspired by the grunge movement [[slowpoke|long after]] it had died, and the world has never looked back since.

==Content==

The site basically involves a huge database of every release by every musical artist ever, unless [[you]] released it yourself and it wasn't on a real record label. Users can then rate the release on a "marks out of 5 stars" scale. This system is [[Josef Fritzl|abused, however]], by the metalheads who rate every Metallica, Slayer and Megadeth album five stars, causing [[butthurt]] to the indiefucks who are [[autistic]] enough to rate their music [[gullible|honestly]] and write [[Pitchfork Media|TL;DR psuedointellectual diatribes]] about what they thought of the record whilst maintaining their [[cool]] and "hipster [[irony]]", instead of "THIS RECORD IS FUCKING BRUTAL. GET IT NOW!" or similar.

{{squote|'''I absolutely detest Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Def Leppard, Evanescence, R.E.M., Joe Cocker, Jewel, Nick Cave, Matchbox 20, Meatloaf, Roxette, Scorpions, Shania Twain, Sonic Youth, The Hives, Counting Crows, Incubus, Maroon 5, Staind, Creed, Madonna, Lenny Kravitz, Black-Eyed Piss, Kate-Bush imitator Tori Amos, girl-on-guitar plinka-plonka crap such as Lisa Loeb or Fiona Apple, atonal nu-metal such as Slipknot and System Of A Down, boy-group metal a la Papa Roach and Linkin Park, "still got da blues" dullards like Eric Clapton and Gary Moore, devoid-of-emotion-ballad-manufacturers like Phil Collins, Rod Stewart and Keane, high-pitched hysterical screaming by pseudo-r'n'b sirens such as Alicia Keys, Anastacia, Whitney Huston or Mariah Carey, spoilt little pseudo-rebel lolita-"punks" such as Avril Lavigne and Pink, primitive truck-drivers' blue-collar rock such as Bruce Springsteen, John C. Melloncamp, The Black Crowes and Bryan Adams, ugly neo-Americana rock a la Hootie & The Blowfish and Nickelback, apathetic/sleepy pop-for-comatose-yuppies a la Dido and Norah Jones, laughable baby-punk such as Green Day, Good Charlotte, and Offspring, worthless DJs with family connections such as Moby, hip-hop/rap...

There are also large numbers of [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER|foreign language]] reviews, and some of these even get [[featured article|frontpaged]] (the [[Aryan|American]] admins always frontpage at least one review written in [[Ebonics|a language they don't understand]], because, well, [[multiculturalism]]). RYM is also well known for frontpaging the deaths of every musician in every fucking genre ever, even if nobody really cared about them in the first place, meaning that the site always has a [[Death List|morose]] feel to it.


===Lists===

Users can make their own lists of whatever they want, generating endless [[deletionist|cruft]] and [[shit nobody cares about|trivia]]. However the lists of most contention are those involving [[the best]] albums of all times. Whilst [[Crazy Frog]] has the worst album of all time according to RYM, the greatest tends to alternate between [[overrated|so-called classic]] albums by [[The Beatles]], [[fag|Radiohead]], Jew and black person.
