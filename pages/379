Almighty Pillage
[[Image:Pillage.jpg|frame]]
The Almighty Pillage is a form of [[Flame War]].

To give the basic structure of the Almighty Pillage:
# A gentle and intellectually stimulating conversation starts between civilized members of an [[LJ]] [[community]]. The conversation might be about [[cat]]s, or [[shit nobody cares about|Andrew Lloyd Webber]], or [[God]] or, more likely, about how stupid everybody else is.
# A group of closely allied flamers (or, more likely, [[troll]]s) discover the conversation.
# Each of the flamers individually attacks the [[OP]] and forces the OP to defend themselves.
# If the OP is perceived to have made any contradictions in their replies to the horde, the horde will claim that they have [[pwn]]t the OP.

This behavior is analogous to a plague of locusts and a farmer. The farmer can't protect every grain of wheat 100% of the time.
