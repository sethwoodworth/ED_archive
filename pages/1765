Cops
''This article is about [[IRL]] police, not to be confused with the [[internet police]]''.<br>
''This article also discusses IRL police officers, which are easily (and acceptably) confused with [[pigs]].

'''Cops''' (also known as '''Rozzers''', '''The 5-0''', '''The Feds''' and '''The Filth''') are the [[IRL]] version of [[mod]]s. They have the power to send you to [[prison|rape house]] whenever the mood strikes them. Because they flunked out of grade school, police are less educated than your average black person, and are actually threatened by anyone who can use words with more than one syllable. Contrary to popular belief, they don't just sit in cop cars all day, eating donuts and drinking coffee, but actually spend 90% of their day [http://jeffunscripted.blogspot.com/2008/08/high-police-officer-calls-911.html confiscating weed, making hash brownies, and trolling 911 operators].

The majority of the police force of any given locality is made up of [[Micropenis|tiny-dicked]], insecure [[rednecks]] suffering from some of the most severe and visible [[IRL]] cases of [[unwarranted self importance]]. [[Some argue]] that the [[government]] created police departments to protect the public by enforcing the governments laws. Police are in fact gangs that the government cannot reign in. So it is in the interest of public safety that you open fire upon any police officers you happen to see. However, if you don't own guns because the government took them away (enjoying your freedom there?), you can read this article for some tips on how to deal with the police.

== Origins and Purpose ==
[[Image:Imacop.jpg|thumb|right|[[At least 100|At least 100%]] of cops have [[unwarranted self importance]].]]

Roughly [[Jesus Christ|2000 years ago]], the [[United States]] government decided to [[troll]] the public by shaving [[pigs]] and squeezing them into blue pants and a shirt, then giving them cars with pretty, [[ADHD]]-placating flashing lights. Their scheme has not worked according to [[Final solution|plan]] and the [[IRL trolling]] has become an epidemic. In order to avoid looking as if things have not gone [[Just as planned|according to plan]], they have since changed their mission statement from "To [[White knight|Protect]] and to [[Blowjob|Serve]]" to "Protect (our own skin) and Serve (ourselves)."

Despite there being nigger police, many whitey police officers are still complete [[racist]]s. Any action they take against any minority is multiplied by [[over 9000]], since they can send people to the [[rape]] dungeon, to be [[goatse|raped until they're 60-something]]. They will actually go out of their way to get as many black persons off the streets, which actually makes the ones that succeed a [[pretty cool guy]]. Its a known fact that since the police are essentially the arm of the [[the man]], they were responsible for framing OJ, turning Michael Jackson white, killing 2-pac, stealing [[Mitchell Henderson]]'s ipod, [[WTC]], introducing Tiger Woods to all those white wimmins, [[Rodney King|beating blackie with flashlights]], and faking the moon landing.

If you do something [[murder|bad enough]], they may actually drop the final ban-hammer on you with a [[in the ass|needle in the ass]], and kicking you off IRL. If a slow painful death at the hands of some pussy poison isn't your flavor, try pulling a gun out when pulled over, as it is a proven source of lulz for everyone. Bonus points for shooting the cops then running away. This provides the press with something to cover, the people for someone to root for, and the cops much needed exercise. And when they finally do kill you, you'll be giving thousands of cops all over the nation sweet, sweet release. Because nothing gets these pigs off faster than the thought of a fellow cop gunning down a civilian. Why do you think they got into this business in the first place?

==Types of Police Officers==

[[Image:LOLIPATROLYOU.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cops are [[trollface|trolls]] of the government.]]
[[File:Secret Cop Pig Logo.jpg|thumb|oink oink.]]

*The standard [[Fag|Boys in Blue]]- Fat douchebags that can be seen a mile away in a standard cop car. Usually so out-of-shape that it's a mircale they can make it to a police station, let alone catch a black person at full sprint. Generally [[retard|poorly educated]], [[racist]], and full of [[unwarranted self-importance]].

*Black Cops - Amazingly, although most niggers are afraid to snitch, let alone go to the police, some go against their kindred, and become cops. Usually steroid abusers who speak in [[ALL CAPS|shouting]], and act like they belong to a gang, despite the fact they were probably rejected for not being able to sneak enough coke up their ass.

*Undercover cops - Like the common Jew, these motherfuckers can be hard to sniff out if you [[newfag|dont know how]]. However, if you aren't a complete retard, they're pretty simple to pick out of a crowd, however be wary around them, as even looking in their general direction will get you busted.

*State Patrol - The [[lie|kings]] of the highway, these are the fuckwits that give you tickets for going 2mph over the speed limit. If your a woman, you just have to show a little cleave, or cry a bit to get out of a ticket, and on occasion suck one off. If your a guy, the best bet is to reach through your window and sock one in the testicles, and drive off to make a high speed chase, eventually ending in you [[an hero|driving your car through a tree/off a cliff]].

*[[Wimmin]] Cops - Dykes. Women who weren't born with a big stick between their legs, so they carry a big stick at work. The best defense against this type is to also be a dyke. Normal women and men are pretty much out of luck.

*Snitches - While not technically cops, they are usually considered just as bad. After your average small-time drug dealer gets busted, he'll usually become the cops [[bitch|informant]]. Being an informant is a lucrative and personally rewarding career. Until the cop doesn't need you anymore, and subsequently burns you to make his arrest record look better. 

*[[FBI]] - The governments police, these guys will come into your house while you sleep, and steal you into the night, never to be heard from again. They can/will erase any trace of you from existence, and will keep any information of you from resurfacing. They control the internet, and [[some argue|some say]] they control ED.

*[[Military]] Police - These guys see themselves as big deals being both police officers and [[fags|servicemen]] dispite the fact that you can just drive/walk off their base to avoid arrest (their jurisdiction stops at the gate) and the fact that the ASVAB score requirement for MPs is less than the minimum score to join the military.

*Correctional Officers - These are semi cops that never had the balls to undergo real cop training. Also known as NotAcOps. ProTip - Put any greasy grimy substance you can find on the doorhandles of your local Jail/Prison. This results in anger and random cavity searches. Be careful, as the womyn variety usually hold some serious resentment towards male prisoners.

*Security Officer/Rent-A-Pig/Mall Cop - These are pretend cops who think they actually are cops when in reality they have [[Useless|little to no actual authority over anything or anybody]]; and yet all of the [[unwarranted self-importance|pure unadulterated ego-power stroking]]. It is this [[Truth|grossly narcissistic misconceived view of reality]] that places many of them on the same level as [[pigs]]

   
===[[Ravpup|Identifying An Undercover Police Officer]]===
[[File:Karengillan2.jpg|thumb|Could be an undercover cop double-bluffing]]
[[Image:Pigs_getting_poisoned.png|thumb|right|Pure and utter [[WIN]]!]]
There are a few ways to spot an officer, undercover or otherwise, in public.

*Mustaches, with each half inch thick doubling the odds of it being the po-po.
*Jeans that aren't pants. This can include jean shirts, jean jackets, jean hats, jean socks, jean speedos, jean glasses, and jean contact lenses. Undercover only, because everyone knows that drug dealers are too cool for regular clothes.
*Sunglasses, aviator preferred.
*Bulges in jackets, usually due to guns, badges, or the actual drugs they steal from black person children. 
*Being white, as all drug dealers are black persons, Mexicans, or in rare cases, [[azn]]s.
*Reading a newspaper upside down trying to look nonchalant.
*Talking with other cops.
*Certain phrases from them are dead giveaways. For instance, "You are under arrest", "snort oink snort", and "Donuts? Who said donuts?"
*May have a camera crew following them around to document their [[Buttsecks|'Daring Exploits']]

=== Cops In The [[UK]] ===
[[Image:Anti lulz police.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The MET's modern day recruitment poster[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/25/met_police_defacement/]]]

In the halcyon days where you could leave your front door open without the fear of being robbed, the local police officers or “Bobbies” as they were called, were seen by the general public as local simpletons in suits. Police procedure in dealing with criminals included:

:* [[Whistles go whoo|Blowing whistles.]] 
:* Slipping on banana skins.
:* Shouting “I know where you live” as the perpetrator makes their getaway.
:* Running really fast while saxophone music plays in the background.
:* [http://www.paltelegraph.com/columnists/peter-eyre/4403-the-deeply-upsetting-story-of-hollie-greig Molesting your daughter] if all else fails

Today’s UK police officer is an entirely different beast. '''The Metropolitan Police Farce''' have taken a leaf out of their US counterpart’s books, not in the way that means using up-to-date methods of forensic [[science]] to produce an air tight case against an alleged criminal; but by using deceit, intimidation, hearsay, [http://www.weeklygripe.co.uk/a430.asp harassment], [http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article3368163.ece lies] and [http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1252819,00.html fraud], they can make sure even the loosest case is put forward for prosecution.

In contrast to this, the volunteer group The [[retard|Special]] Cunt-stubbles (or PCSOs aka 'Hobby Bobbies') are about [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2505301.ece as effective as a chocolate fireguard].

=== [[To Catch a Predator]] ===
If you continue looking for [[loli]] and [[CP]] on the internet, then there's a 99.99% chance of you getting the infamous [[Party Van|party van]] logo on your comp. It is inadvisable to use your friend's, or local library's computer to do so, as this can lead to either getting arrested. Because of their severe retardation, Cops are easy to fool this way, and really dont give a shit who they send to jail, as long as he's black.

==[[PROTIP]]s for talking to police officer==
[[Image:Pig gets pwned pwnt on knees.jpg|thumb|Proper handling of a Cop.]]
[[Image:Menezescomposite.jpg|thumb|All people of color look the same to the police, therefore they will all be shot on sight.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7235200.stm]]]

If you encounter one of these '''COP'''s ([[Cockmongler|'''C'''ockmongling]] '''O'''verdressed [[pig|'''P'''ig]]), DO ''NOT'' attempt to reason with it. These beasts suffer from severe [[intellectual insufficiency]] and will attempt to beat you down with the three sentences they know or, failing that, a big [[black]] [[Wikipedia:Nightstick|phallus]]. Instead:

<div style="height:300px; overflow:scroll;">
# Ask him why he decided to drop out of high school to become an officer.
# Ask the [[irony|pig]] if he's Jewish. Cops will really [[rape|love]] you for that. Especcially if they ARE [[niggers|Jewish]].
# Pretend you don't speak English so you must communicate with a series of grunts and oinks.
# Bribe them with a donut when pulled over, or some kfc if its a black person. Always keep both in your glove compartment for emergencies.
# Be concise and to the point when talking to them. They have the attention spans of ADD children on coke.
# Ask him if his career makes up for him being bullied in high school.
# [[GTFO|Calmly walk away]]. Pigs are sensitive to rapid movement and may chase you if you run.
# If you happen upon a female officer, smack her hard on the ass. Most female cops are [[Butch|very effeminate and have nothing against men]]. They may even have [[Lie|sex]] with you!
# Never pull your car over to the side of the road. (Seriously, what are they going to do, go ''Mad Max'' on your ass?)
# Police love the crack, try offering them some on the streets to support our boys in blue!
# Should your pig become agitated, you may need to [[euthanize]] it. Do so by the following means:
#* '''If [[male]]:''' [[Firearms]] are the preferred form of [[murder]], but anything that comes to hand will do the job, really. Beating a pig to death with your [[cock]] (if you can find it) means major bonus [[points]]. Don't forget to ''"put two in its head to make sure that it's dead"!''
#* '''If [[female]]:''' Attempt to suck the pig's brains out. Everyone knows that pigs' brains are located in their lower abdomen, so the penis is the easiest route. [[BJ|Suck]] until the [[cum|brains]] squirt out. You'll know this occurs when the pig sighs out its dying breath and you feel the brains fly into your throat. 
# If all other attempts at negotiation fail, open your car door very fast and bash that fucking pig in the face. If it didn't [[retard|brain damage]] him or kill him, he'll be too incapacitated to give you his precious fucking ticket.
# Play like you didn't know [[9/11|what you were doing was illegal]] even though you know full well [[Masturbating|what you were actually doing]]. If you speak intelligently and clearly when telling them this then they will be so distracted by your ability to form coherent sentences, that they will let you go with a warning.

=== [[Moar]] tips for dealing with cops ===
* Always become highly intoxicated before driving. This way, the cop will be so put off by your mannerisms that he will flee into the woods to regroup (don't know with what).
* If you see a young woman who is being [[alcohol#driving|immorally arrested]], don't think that means you have to sit back and idly watch!  [[trolling_irl|Invoke your first amendment rights]] by filming yourself shouting [http://wakeup2010.blogspot.com/2010/08/arrested-for-calling-cop-nazi.html "Nazi," "Gestapo," and babbling about the ILLUMINATI.]  The officers involved will quickly realize their mistake, release the young lady, and you will have made a [[rape|brand new friend]].
* If you are caught outside the car, or must stop for some [[Piss|important reason]], remember to speak to the pig in its native tongue, by oinking. This will make it feel at ease, and you'll see its joy in the increased blush of its skin, and the loud oinks it replies with.
* When pulled over, it is best to say, "Yeah, I got something for ya, pig" and reach ''very quickly'' into your glove box to get your registration.  
* If you are a minority, try going out in white face. You could do pretty much anything you want.
* Never speak to them. Cops are always trying to size everyone up in the room, and might be trying to get you for something. This is why a lot of [[Internet tough guy|internet tough guys]] are wannabe cops [[IRL]]. 
* Odds are you won't get caught speeding anyway, as everyone knows that they go in pairs in order to blow each other until the shifts up.
* Women should always wear an open shirt, as no officer can resist dem' magnificent tits.

Just in case you're a fucking [[retard]] and think the "tips" above will amuse the cop, make him sympathize with you, and let you go, you are very wrong indeed.  You will quickly be introduced to [[police brutality|a whole new vista of pain]].

Being a drunk, the author of the tips below had his fair share of encounters with the police, some brutal, some rather unremarkable, some very lucky. He's figured out a few things that may help to smooth out an encounter, and he’ll share them with you with the stipulation that he is not a real lawyer, only an [[E-lawyer|eLawyer]] who's been arrested a few times too many.

[[File:Fascist Pigs.jpg|thumb|Never forget. He can kick your ass and get away with it.]]
<div style="height:300px; overflow:scroll;">
*Be polite. Always be polite. Use '''sir''' and '''ma’am.''' Do not call the cops '''[[truth|jackbooted government thugs]]''' or “fuckheads” or “stinking dicklickers.” A little politeness will go a long way. 

*If stopped by an [[cop|officer]], you are required under ''[[moonspeak|Terry v. Ohio]]'' to give your legal name, your address, and your business abroad, i.e. going on a [[beer]] run. Give this information freely and politely. (Actually, not true. The officer must have "reasonable suspicion" which must be based on "specific and articulable facts".)

*Also under ''Terry'' you can be '''[[molest|stopped and frisked]]''' for weapons. This is perfectly legal. [[Derp|A cop digging through your pockets is something I don’t think is legal]], but resistance is futile. Just consult your lawyer. 

*Speaking of lawyers, have one, and have his or her name in your wallet. If you are guilty of something serious, invoke your right to counsel and say that you want your lawyer present for questioning.  You will [[rage|rile]] the cop, but wouldn't you rather survive a bad experience with the pigs than years in [[prison]]? 

*Don’t lie, even if it is in your nature. If you’re drunk, the cop is going to know. If you’ve had four beers before getting behind the wheel, just admit it. Cops tend to like honesty. If you really don’t want to incriminate yourself, you don’t have to under the Fifth Amendment. Say something like “I’d like to invoke my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.” You may have to say it a few times, but be polite and firm and it should work. Just '''DON’T LIE'''. 

*You may be under the mistaken impression that you can get out of an arrest because you weren’t read your rights. Wrong. If you are caught in the act of a crime, the cop can charge you and, since he doesn’t need to question you, you don’t need to be read your ''Miranda'' rights.  I was arrested once for pissing on the front wall of a [[stripper|strip bar]].  They didn't have to read me my rights, obviously, since they saw me do it. 

*If you are going to be arrested, be a man or woman about it. Don’t cry, beg, plead, or bargain. This just arouses contempt in the black heart of the cop. Take your cuffing like an adult. Whatever you do, don’t resist. It could get you '''[[police brutality|subdued]]''' or seriously hurt.

*If you are stopped while driving, keep your hands on the wheel. Don’t go digging in the glove compartment. Comply with the officers requests, be honest, don’t lie, and be polite. 

*Don’t carry drugs or weapons on your person outside. It’s stupid, and the cops will find them.

*Use the '''reasonable person''' argument. Say to the officer something like, “Well, sir, I think a reasonable person in this situation would invoke his right to remain silent, so I’m going to go ahead and do that.” The ''reasonable person'' is a legal term, so it carries weight. 

*DO NOT, under any circumstances, touch a cop in a manner that could even remotely be considered hostile.  Even bumping into an officer's shoulder can and has been ruled as assaulting a police officer, and the penalties for this are extremely severe. 

*If you do have something in your car you'd rather the cops not find, but he can't prove it without searching your car, you do have the right to refuse him the right to search your car.  Just say "I do not consent to any searches," and do not let yourself be bullied by the cop.  Speak clearly and with confidence, and be prepared to repeat yourself.  It won't always work, but it will give your lawyer something to work with.  Also, if he can ''see'' whatever it is that he feels necessitates a search, there's nothing you can do.  This is called the "plain sight" rule.  Meaning if you're stupid enough to leave weed or an open bottle of rum in plain sight, it's your own dumb fault. 

*Also, do not run. Running only adds more charges on to your ass. Plus, no one likes running. If you make a cop run, he will take your ass down hard. 

*If a cop prevents you from leaving but doesn't arrest you, it has been legally ruled detainment. Simply say "If you are barring me from leaving, I request my attorney for this detainment."
