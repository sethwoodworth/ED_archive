[[Image:Spikechester.jpg|frame|That little yellow dog is a '''Me Too-er'''. Fucking douche-bag.]]
A common phenomenon in a flame war, the '''Me too-er''' is that gutless [[fuck]] that will forever agree with the individual you are pwning or being [[pwnt]] by, with countless "Yeah!" and "You fucking n00b, listen to what [[anonymous pussy|xxxxx]] has to say!" posts. Normally, these yes-men are nothing more than a mere annoyance, but occasionally their mindless follow-and-flame tactics are true [[bodyxpolitic|lulzworthy material]], especially when they openly contradict themselves without realising. Weapon of choice: [[iawtc]], [[^]], pointless [[lol]] posts.

So it is your duty to teh [[internets]] to expose that [[cock|little worm]] for the gutless [[flame warrior]] he is. You will be crowned King of Teh Internets for doing so- and what [[D&D]] nerd could resist such [[Admin|power]]?
