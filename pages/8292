The Register

<br>
'''The Register''' is a news website run by [[Britain|britfags]], mainly about [[Computer Science III|technology]] news and [[Hackers on steroids|security]], but also covering [[Internet Law]] among other topics. The site is filled with ads to the point that [[Firefox|adblock]] is almost required to read it. Although generally [[unfunny]], the site does sometimes produce some [[lulz]].

The Register hates the [[Gordon Brown|British government]], especially [[Jacqui Smith]]. They also hate [[Phorm]], although they are probably being [[paranoid]].

They also covered the massive [[drama]] about [[PIFTS.exe]].

==Articles Commentary==
Their articles have a comments system which is full of [[retards]] and people making the same [[unfunny]] jokes over and over again on every single article and getting into the same arguments. Comments are fairly easy to troll, although [[fail|posts require approval]] and if you are too obvious in your trolling, it won't get approved. Be subtle.

The Register hate [[Wikipedia]] too, referring to their editors as "[[pedo|wiki-fiddlers]]".
