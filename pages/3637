Haters
[[Image:Irish282_pic.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Irish282]]: "Many kids are called "sh*t"...I call that hate."]]
In the world of [[YouTube|les tubes]], <b>haters</b> are people who express a negative opinion or dislike of a persons video(s).  Anti-haters are the [[lolcow|freedom fighters]] against [[Victim complex|HATER oppression]].  It's important to note that if you vote anything but <s>5-stars</s> '''Thumbs up'''  on a persons video, you are a hater.

== The "[[hugbox|One World]]" Movement ==
Imagine a bunch of the [[furry|lowest forms of society]] coming together as one.  Of course, these people, doomed for [[fail]]ure, are secretly green with [[jealousy|envy]] at the top artists and [[original content|contributers]] to the [[website]]. They feel that, as the [[ass|bottom]] of the barrel they must go way [[trying too hard|out of their way]] to be the [[fat|biggest]], most [[VioletKitty411|obnoxious]] [[fucktard]]s on the face of the [[interweb|webbernets]] in order to get attention.

For example, people like [[Argent009]] have tried to come up as [[unrealistic expectations|leaders]] to [[unwarranted self importance|speak]] for the [[lusers|unfortunate]].  What Argent fails to realize is that he is essentially vying to become a dwarf among midgets.The sad truth is when it comes down to it -- "haters" are basically people who don't like the content generated by a certain user.  Even a polite critique can result in being called a hater -- much like a non-hivemind edit on [[TOW]] instantly makes you a [[troll]].

The One World YouTube meme was originally started by [[MadV]] before becoming massively viral, which just goes to prove that a lack of artistic integrity isn't always necessary to create enormous Internet memes, even though this was probably the only time in history, where that was the case.

== Lobbying the creators ==
The only video [[Steve Chen]] and [[Chad Hurley]] made were when they were packing up the tent and leaving town, yet for some reason people believe that Steve is someone [[no|everyone can connect and relate to]].  Many anti-haters fool themselves into believing the personnel at YouTube and [[Google]] care about their users despite the fact they were just bought out.  This only reinforces the fact that '''Anti-Haters''' are most [[typical]]ly [[delusional]].
