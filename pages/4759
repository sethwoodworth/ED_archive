Laura Biddulph skyrocketed to relative obscurity/favored JO material among many of the basement-dwelling, vagina deprived denizens of the interbutts after being featured on [http://www.itv.com/itvplayer/video/?Filter=116199 ITV1 60 Minute Makeover] (Skip to 15:30 to see the [[tits|few seconds of the show worth watching]]). The show's only viewer, one [[Basement-dweller|Ginger Pissflaps]], created a thread about Laura Biddulph (the daughter of some trampy bint who couldn't be arsed doing her own decorating) and her magical norks (estimated to be about [http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/3950/21058100879013276624100.jpg 32 DD]). 

== Legendary internet pervert KEANOS FIST ==

KEANOS FIST was one of the first on the scene in the thread after being freshly released from prison following a series of shark molestations after he met fellow sharkophiles through popular website [http://www.gumtree.co.uk Gumtree] and the disappearance and suspected murder of forumista Dr. Octopus. Not far behind was pokey bum loving forumista Canton4, who upon realising he wasn't too far away from Laura's tits decided to hunt her down on the popular site for people with dyslexia, [http://www.facebook.com Facebook]. This caused an unprecedented interest from other forumistas as the notorious [[Cameltoe]] searching sicko Billy The Boozer provided various screenshots (or links to those within the circle) of [http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/9844/21058100879143276611100.jpg Laura's assets].

== Facebook Group ==

This invariably led to Canton4 proposing that a now sadly departed Facebook group was made in her honour by 4everred so Manchester's finest sex pests could ogle her breasts and make silly songs and videos about her and degrading sex acts such as spraying her breasts with AIDS paste, bukkake and scat. [http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/2866/tshirt3.gif Prototype t-shirts] such as [http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/9863/tshirt2.gif this] and [http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/4274/tshirt1.gif this] were even created to capitalize on the merchandising potential for tv's new reality star. The creme de la creme though was the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYy1rtd1K4s legendary video showing Hitler's response], using the well known and perhaps overused but still applicable internet [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Meme meme], made by forumista Lucky Man along with several [http://www.grapheine.com/bombaytv/movie-br-24e0a4791847eb39ea27fac43f12fa5b.html Bombay TV] subtitled short films on the subject by various forumistas.

== Oblivion ==

After a few days the 1000+ reply thread disappeared in to oblivion after chatmaster's crappy server couldn't handle the interest the thread generated. Luckily we only had to wait a few seconds before a new one emerged with what turned out to be a pitiful attempt of a WUM by the mods to make members of the Facebook group have runny excrement running down their trousers/ sisters thongs. They then co-opted Ginger Pissflaps and Canton4 to attempt to make their WUM more believeable after being called out by several forumistas as Bullshit. Unfortunately some forumistas took it far too seriously and the creater of the thread, the aforementioned Ginger Pissflaps, is reported to be in hiding in a toilet being anally beasted by a twenty stone biker somewhere in Manchester's Canal Street in a desperate attempt to hide his tracks by claiming he is a full blown gayer and would never partake in such an act. Unfortunately for him the GMP have recovered what has proved to be his laptop at the Bridgewater Canal in Worsley and are recovering the contents of his hard drive for evidence, which may take a while once they've filtered through the videos of him and fellow forumista Westy molesting various animals such as sheep, horses and hamsters. 

It has also since come to light that Canton4 has also gone AWOL after his father (gerryb) requested he answered a separate thread regarding his part in the seedy antics. Early reports suggest he is possibly heading to Colombia to meet fellow forumista and powder lover Keyser Scholze, if this indeed confirmed then GMP will not be taking any further action against Canton4 as he'll either get himself shot, catch AIDS from a transvestite in a nightclub or most likely overdose on Daz Ultra after mistaking it for plant feeder. These two then came back after an absence of a few hours saying that they have been contacted by the dibble over the entire incident. This is the second attempt at turning it into a WUM which no-one believes.

Laura has placed herself in the public eye by appearing on 60 Minute Makeover and also by her appearance on The X-Factor. Any and all information that may or may not have been acquired was in the public domain and therefore freely accessible to anyone who could manage to turn a computer on. Even Paul Salford.

== 15 Minutes Of Fame ==

As Andy Warhol put it ''"In the future everyone will be world famous for 15 minutes"'' and Laura's time in the spotlight is fading already. Laura has studied the performing arts for many years while also undertaking work experience in the local [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Stripper Spearmint Rhino]. She needs to take this opportunity to become yet another fame hungry slag butchered on the altar of public opinion (and several Premiership footballer's cocks too for that matter) in order to maximize her potential future earnings as a [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Whore Cock Lover].
