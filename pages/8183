The Duggars started out as a man and woman that loved each other very much. They also [[pedophilia|love children]] enough to have had 19 of them so far. 

Using the bible in lieu of the [[Kama Sutra]] (it being too dirty for their god loving sensibilities), as their [[cult|religion]] requires that they have to have one child every time they have sex, and based on their goal to try every position in the book, they are expected to have [[over 9000]] [[demon|children]]. Allowing for 9 months per pregnancy, they will be finishing up sometime in the year 12,000,000 (note: these numbers are based on the King James Bible; the Vulgate of St. Jerome will have them finishing up later as it is a much racier book).

The parents were apparently [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] by [[Christian]] [[batshit|wingnuts]] like the [[demon|children]] and as such only know one letter of the alphabet.  Due to this all the [[demon|children’s]] names begin with “J”.

It is unclear what exactly the father does for a living but [[some argue]] that he pimps out his children and wife instead of working 16 hours a day like the Calvinist he claims to be.
