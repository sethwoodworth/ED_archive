Hotline
'''Hotline''' was a bastard attempt at dragging the bullshit of an [[old school]] BBS into the 90s using the [[internets]]. It originated sometime [[last Thursday]] and was mainly used for trading [[warez]] and [[pornography|pr0n]]. Tonnes of [[script kiddies]] set up Hotline servers running off their [[basement]] cable and dialup connections with [[homosexual|gay]] [[hacker]] names like "Dem0nz Lare" and "WaReZ tHe WaReZ". It required the use of a [[spyware|software client]] and tracker websites, which was too much effort for most internet [[fucktards]] so now Hotline languishes in a putrid pool of its own [[fail]].

Hotline was notable for not only allowing [[pedophilia|kiddie fiddlers]] to trade their [[sick fuck|sick fucking shit]] through private servers but also for the way it combined [[pirate|piracy]] with [[forum|forums]] and [[chat]]. Thankfully, most of the [[over 9000]] servers were created by [[Mouth_breather|mouth breathing loners]] who [[trying too hard|desperately]] wanted to be the [[sysop]] of a [[leet|1337]] BBS back in 1740 or whenever the fuck "War Games" was released.

And if Hotline wasn't bad enough, [[Macintosh]] fags had their own version called '''Carracho''', where they traded OS9 applications, [[CP]] and AIDS. Today, people just use Rapidshit and BitTorrent, but Hotline/Carracho was a mild improvement on IRC, although after you'd spent over 9,000 hours on your parent's shitty dialup modem downloading Dreamweaver 2 only to find a folder filled with [[Goatse]], the desire to become [[an hero]] increases significantly. Today, there are only about fifteen Hotline servers still running.
