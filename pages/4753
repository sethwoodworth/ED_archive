Latarian Milton
[[Image:MOAR_hoodrat.jpg|thumb|Moar Hoodrat!]]
At seven years old, Latarian Milton is the world's youngest [[trolling_IRL|irl troll]].  Since his mom was a rock-smoking [[16_year_old_girl|16-year-old]] [[Sheneequa]] when he was born, his [[grandmother]] has to pick up the pieces and raise him.  
==Trolling on the Road==
For some guaranteed [[lulz]], he stole his grandmother's SUV, pwn'ed several mailboxes, hit [[at least 100]] other cars, and eventually totalled the SUV.  He said he was mad at his mom, but he really just wanted to do hoodrat stuff with his friend who [[smoking|smokes with cigarettes]] 'cause it's [[troll|fun to do bad things]].  They can't put him in [[jail]] because his [[manboobs]] would be [[rape|titty raeped]] by [[Bubba]], his future self.  You see, if your future self rapes you, it will disrupt the time-space continuum and all existence will collapse into a quantum point inside your asshole. The seven year-old niglet proves that the stereotypes about black people that liberals love to dispute (stealing cars and requiring daily rations of fried chicken to quell their nigtardness) are true.

It's common knowledge that the term "hoodrat" refers to sex partners you fuck on the hood of your car because they're so fugly that you don't want your housemates knowing what you're willing to put your genitals up against.  Good to see that Latarian is at peace with the fact that he's basically undeserving of love and respect.

==Trolling in Wal-Mart==
He "soonly" reappeared in the news after he got [[butthurt]] when his grandmother wouldn't buy him [[Fried_chicken|fried chicken]] at [[Wal-Mart]].  He [[pwnt]] his grandmother right there in the store.  Much lulz ensued.

{{quote|'''He just started hitting me in front of the whole Wal-Mart, and everyone in there was upset.  In my stomach, in my legs--wherever he could reach me, that's where he hit me.'''|Latarian's grandmother}}

In attempt to kill the [[lulz]], the [[police]] came to his house and took him to the mental hospital.

{{quote|'''I'm sorry what I did to my grandma truck, and I'm sorry what I did to you people in the hospital.  And I love you, and I hope you be impressed.'''|Latarian Milton}}

==Trolling on Judge Judy?==
No. After Latarian's [[Condoleezza Rice|mammy]] yapped about the show requesting that she [[internet court|sue her daughter]], the following statement was release:

{{quote|'''Judge Judy does not believe in fostering litigation and if that is what happened, then canceling the case was the only option.'''|Pussies from Judge Judy}}

{{quote|[[Unwarranted_Self-Importance|'''She's heard it from everybody but Judge Judy.''']]|Latarian's grandmother, on her check, I mean child}}

{{quote|'''[[Lie|I feel pretty bad about it]]... [I just want to] [[steal|get a job]] in the house, and a wife.'''|Latarian, whose future wife (re)appears seconds later (2:08), waiting for him to [[cum|finish]].}}

{{quote|'''I can be a supa star or somethin', and my grandma...'''|Latarianigger, who just had his Hollyhood dreams shattered}}

==Latarian on The Boondocks ==
Latarian was featured in an episode of [[The Boondocks]] where he was packaged as a [[Demon|Demon Child]] that [[what|couldn't die at all]]. [[Srsly]]
