Pixie [[Australia|Australian]] newsreader '''Charmaine Dragun''' splattered herself all over the seaside in November 2007 after jumping off a cliff called [[goatse|"The Gap"]], a notorious [[suicide]] spot near [[Sydney]]. The "[[schizophrenia|beautiful and bubbly]]" Perth native took her life just hours before she was due to read the 5pm [[Perth]] news bulletin from the Ten Network's Sydney studios.

==Why?==
In a 2006 interview, Dragun said that she hated Sydney and she [[nostalgia|really missed Perth]]. Her boyfriend Simon Struthers, a [[vampire|forensic pathologist]] and [[bisexual|musician]], said that he received a text message from Charmaine, moments before she [[an hero|an-heroically left him forever]], expressing her [[stupid|noble actions]].

The couple, who had been together [[16-year-old girl|since they were 16]], had also begun talking about ruining their lives by starting a family. A music lover, Dragun purchased [[bork|Bjork]] concert tickets hours before her body was found at the base of sea-cliffs, and of course, the logical response to almost listening to [[Ricardo_Lopez|Bjork]] is [[an_hero|suicide]].

[[Necrophilia|As the first forensic pathologist on the scene, Simon Struthers agreed to conduct the autopsy to ascertain her exact cause of death]].

== From Sydney To Perth ==
Google Maps says they are 3,951 km apart, and it takes about 2 days to get from one to the other by car. On an airplane, it takes about 4 hours.

==A kind gesture==
In response to Dragun's suicide, the Ten Network announced that it would move the program back to Perth.

==Shit nobody cares about==
An inquest has [[Last_Thursday|recently]] be launched into her death, but who gives a fuck, amiright?.
UPDATE UPDATE!
After 3 years of interviews, testimony and research the inquisition has discovered that Charmaine was in fact depressed, shocking everyone without a brain.
