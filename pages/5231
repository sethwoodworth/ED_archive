'''Mathematics''' or '''math''' (from the [[UK|English]] '''''maffs''''') is a tired old [[old meme]].  Everyone was [[Socrates|born with preternatural knowledge of math]], and can achieve pinnacles of brilliance even while sleeping. It has numerous numbers in it, unique squiggly symbols and significant irrational actors. It is suggested that mathematics not be attempted under the influence, as [[facepalm|it is difficult to drink and derive at the same time]].
Math, like breathing, needs to be done at all times. The difference being that math is no fucking fun to do.

== Math in the Middle Ages ==

[[Image:Remedial math.jpg|thumb|/b/ are smart]]
Back before the time of [[enlightenment]], when the earth was ruled by level 60 barbs, mathematics were not only frowned upon, but was also proof of the devils [[buttsecks|influence]] on men. (For more on "devils influence" see [[Jews]]) This widespread belief that numbers were Satan's language is attributed by most [[lulz|lulztorians]] to the existence of mathemagicians. Mathemagicians were [[Bloodninja|high level mages]] who cast numerical spells on the village people. Most were fed to lions. This caused great envy from [[Catholics]]. They saw this as the mathemagicians way of stealing their [[Kill_it_with_fire|fire]].

== Math in America ==

'''Math''' in [[Dumbfuckistan]] is something that nobody likes. Americunts do -however- enjoy [[pizza]]. They just don't like trying to figure out the complex algebra that comes with figuring out what all those additional toppings and shit are going to cost them.

== With mathematics you can ==
* Recreate [[dinosaurs|Jurassic Park]].
* Hack [[the Matrix]]
* [[Time travel | Travel back in time]], to become [[Futurama|your own father]].
* Measure your [[penis]] and/or [[vagina]].
* Work in a fish and chip shop and give the incorrect change to customers.
* Calculate the [[Over 9000|length of Longcat]]
* Cheat at [[Nerd|Dungeons & Dragons]].
* Pick up [[chicks]] (<s>Let me be tangent to your curves</s> ahahahHAHAHAHJAAHAJAAAhahaaahaha,[[FAIL]])
* Determine the chances of you [[The Game|losing]] your virginity (0%) to a farm animal (100%) ([[LOL WUT]])
* End up crippled like [[Stephen Hawking]].
* Become [[an hero|a mathalete]].
* Compete in the [[Special_Olympics|Math Olympics]].
* Write a line's or scatterplot's biography because [[lie|it's so important]].
* [[Hackers|Hack the Gibson]]

==How to Troll [[aspies|Mathematicians]] on the [[B|Internet]]==
* 1 =/= .99999...
**Say that .99999... is a [[LOL WUT|increasing number]] that never reaches one
* 0^0 =/= 1
* 0! =/= 1
* Give some proof that two different numbers are equal to each other
**Don't be afraid to divide by zero!
* 0/0 is everything. [[Where is your God now?]]
* boob + boob = boobs  Therefore s = 2
* Claim that the ability to have [[Theoretical Physics|equal amounts of hot dogs to buns]] is impossible

'''PROTIP:''' Make a small image with your equation of choice, post this along with "Prove Me Wrong". Then just sit back and watch every pseudo-intellectual on /b/ rage.

== Rigorous Rules of the Internet ==

===Axioms===


*Do not talk about [[b|/b/]] (Rule 1)
*Do [[Caps lock|NOT]] talk about /b/ (Rule 2)
*We are [[Anonymous]]. (Rule 3) 
*[[Hackers on Steroids|Anonymous is Legion]]. (Rule 4)
*Anonymous never [[Internet Hate Machine|forgives]]. (Rule 5)
*Anonymous is still able to [[spam|deliver]] (Rule 7)
*Arguing with [[Troll]] &equiv; Troll is [[winrar|WINNAR]]. (Rule 14)
*[[Copypasta]] is made to [[rape|ruin]] every last bit of [[original content|originality]] (Rule 22)
([[PROTIP]]: any proof involving Rule 1, 2 or 3 is automatically a [[Divide by zero|contradiction]], leave them alone)

===Set Theory===

*{Girls} &cap; {People on the Internet} = [[nothing|&empty;]]. (Rule 30)
*{girls on the internet} &sub; {men on the internet}. (Rule 29 (a), logically equivalent to Rule 30)
*{underageB&s on the internet} &sub; {undercover [[The Man|FBI agents]]} &cup; {[[Chris Hansen]]}. (Rule 29 (b) w/ Chris Hansen)
*{things that exist} &equiv; {things that have [[pr0n|pornography]] about it}. [[Rule 34]]
*{X: X is sacred} &equiv; &empty;. (Rule 42)
*{things to be taken seriously} &equiv; &empty;. (Rule 20)
*&forall; X: X &isin; [[copypasta|{reposts}]], X &isin; {reposts of reposts}. (Rule 24)
*Anonymous &isin; {horrible, uncaring monsters} (Rule 6)
*{rules about posting} &nsub; {real rules} (Rule 8)
*{rules about moderation} &nsub; {[[Banhammer|real rules]]} (Rule 9)
*{things you can say} &sub; {things that can be altered} (Rule 13)

===Conditionals===

*X exists &rArr; X has porn &or; [[Sick Fuck|Porn containing X]] has yet to be made (can be taken as an [[Rule 34|Axiom]]).
*X claims to be a Girl &rArr; X is a man (corollary of: &not; &exist; Girls on the internet). (Rule 30)
*X claims to be an underageB& &rArr; X is a FBI agent &or; X is [[Chris Hansen]]. (Rule 29 (b) w/ Chris Hansen)
*X is to be talked about &rArr; X is not /b/. (Rules 1 & 2)
*X is a repost &rArr; X is a repost of a repost. (Rule 24)
*X is fucked up &rArr; &exist; Y more fucked up than X. (Rule 36)
*Let P be the proposition: You like rival sites. P &rArr; &not;P (Rule 10, See also: [[Divide by zero|Paradox]])
*&forall;X: X is a carefully picked argument of yours &rArr; X can be easily ignored. (Rule 11)
*&forall;X: X is something you say &rArr; X can be used [[Powerword|against you]]. (Rule 12)
*&forall;X: X can be labeled &rArr; X can be hated. (Rule 18)
*Copypasta is made to ruin every last bit of originality (Rule 23)
**Proof of Rule 23: Given that Rule 22 is true. Rule 23 = Rule 22. &there4; Rule 23 is true. [[Where is your God now?|QED]].

===General Theorems===

*[[Divide by zero|Division by Zero]] is not possible/defined. (Rule 37) (Unless: k/0 = 0, if k = 0 -> 0*0 = 0! [[Win|Solved!]])
*[[GTFO|TITS &or; GTFO]]. (Rule 31)
*How [[penis|hard]] you try &prop; how hard you [[fail]]. (Rule 15)
*An object's beauty/pureness &prop; satisfaction attained by it's [[34|corruption]]. (Rule 43)
*As time &rarr; &infin;, WIN &rarr; FAIL. (Rule 17)
*As FAIL &rarr; &infin;, FAIL &rarr; EPIC FAIL. (Rule 16)
*As length N of thread T &rarr; &infin;, P(&exist; a post in T comparing somebody to [[Nazis]]/[[Hitler]] | N) = 1 ([[Godwin's Law]])
*The time span of original content from birth to [[old meme]] << the total lifetime of a meme. (Rule 21)
**One of the many theoretical predictions to be tested in the [[Large Hadron Collider]]
*Relevance to [[OP]] &prop; 1/n, where n is the number of posts in the thread. (Rule 25)
**There is [[Wikipedia|evidence]] to suggest that Relevance to OP decreases exponentially: &prop; exp(-n)
*Your hate of [[Malcolm X|X]] &prop; Strength of X. (Rule 19)

===Fur-analysis===

*{Furries} &sub; {Bat Shit Insane People}. (conjecture, not yet a rule)
* If X exists &rArr; &exist; Furry Porn with X (Rule 46)
*{Furries} &cap; {Pedos} &equiv; {Cub Artists}
*{Furries} &sub; {[[Shit nobody cares about|Srs business]]}
*{Baby Furs} &sub; {Furries} &sub; {Bat Shit Insane} [see fig (1)]
**{Furries} &cap; {Adult Babies} &equiv; {Baby Furs}
