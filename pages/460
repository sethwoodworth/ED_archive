Andrew Sullivan
[[Image:Andrewsullivan.jpg|thumb|There's no such thing as too [[bear|hairy]]!]]
Andrew Sullivan, aka Sully, aka St. Andrew, aka "RawMuscleGlutes" is one of the most [[1337]] [[blog|blawggers]] of the [[blogosphere|Blog-O-Sphere]]. It is unclear whether he's allied with the [[leftards]], or the [[conservative|rightards]]. But he's certainly reviled by both sides. Andrew used to love [[George W. Bush]], but then Bush betrayed him and now he has a [[no homo|crush]] on [[Obama]]. He possesses levels of empathy for victims of [[torture]] previously thought impossible even for [[gay]] men, and may border on superhuman. This extreme empathy has driven him mostly [[insane]], as apparent from his blawg, which still manages to draw quite a bit of traffic, possibly because he's a train-wreck of [[lulz]] that people cannot look away from. 

Experts advise all persons to stay away from Sully's [[ass|glutes]], since he is infected with [[AIDS|GAY COOTIES]].

== Early Life ==
Sully was born in [[England]], where 99% of all males are either [[gay]] or [[bi]]. He was [[molest|raised]] in the [[Catholic]] church. He moved to America to pursue a career in [[old media|professional political bitching]]. He got a job with the greatest  magazine evar, [[Scott Thomas Beauchamp|''The New Republic'']].[[Image:Andrewsullivanmask.jpg|thumb|At night, Andrew Sullivan sleeps with an oxygen mask that enhances his homosexual powers.]]

== Sully does not care about Black People ==
In 1994, as editor of ''The New Republic'', Sullivan published irrefutable [[science|scientific]] proof[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve] that [[niggers|blacks]] are genetically inferior to [[whites]] and [[azns|Asians]][http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1271]. {{quote|The notion that there might be resilient ethnic differences in intelligence is not, we believe, an inherently racist belief. Sorry, Niggers.|Andrew Sullivan, ''The New Republic''}}

Most of the staff of ''The New Republic'' were [[black people love us!|nigger-lovers]] who distanced themselves from Sullivan's views and were all like "OH NOES!! [[racist|RACISM]]!!1121!" Not long after, Sully was [[ban|fired]] from ''TNR''.

== IRL Troll, Dong Collector ==
Sullivan has called for [[scat|morality]] in the [[gay]] community, and has attacked homosexuals for their "libidinal pathology," and their "reckless" sexual behavior during the [[AIDS]] [[lulz|crisis]]. He also criticized [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] for his "reckless, oblivious, careening narcissism" displayed during the [[Monica Lewinsky|Lewinsky]] affair. [[Ppl]] thought Sullivan was totally [[serious|serial]], but really he was just [[trolling]].

Under the [[AOL]] screen name "RawMuscleGlutes" Sullivan went looking for [[buttsecks|love]] on websites such as BarebackCity.com.

He described himself as:
{{quote|DC Male 35 5'9" 198 32w 45c 17a 19neck big hairy thighs; squatting 8 plates. solid bodybuilder, 10 percent body-fat; huge shoulders, strong, hairy b*tt; semi-bearded. into: hairy, endowed, masculine men. always 4.20. vers/top brothers welcome. uncut a plus.

[[Lulz]] and [[butthurt]] ensued after Sully's [[OL]] hijinks became public. Now He finds other groups to [[troll]].

== Sully Bravely Contracts Faggot Fever ==

St. Andrew is one of the bravest men on the [[internets]]. [[Last Thursday]], Sully courageously contracted [[AIDS|queer cancer]]. He caught it after a [[condom]] broke while he was having [[oral sex]]. Uh..... [[bullshit|right]].

Contrary to [[popular belief]] that this was a [[fail|bad thing]], Sully sez that having the [[AIDS|pansy plague]] is actually [[cockmongler|totally awesome]].[http://boifromtroy.com/?p=4187]
{{quote|HIV transformed my life, made me a better and braver writer, prompted me to write the first big book pushing marriage rights, got me to take better care of my health, improved my sex life, and deepened my spirituality.|Sully}}

To this day Sully continues to [[attention whore|promote AIDS awareness]].

== Trolling the Iraq War ==
Sully immediately supported the invasion of [[Iraq]] and even suggested using ([[ZOMG]]!) [[holocaust|nuclear weapons]]. 
[http://time-blog.com/daily_dish/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2001_10_01_dish_archive.html#6398404]
His eager support grew from his deep [[personal army|respect]] for the [[military|troops]].
{{quote|i'm sorry but i pay for those soldiers to fight in a volunteer army. they are servants of people like me who will never fight. yes, [[BDSM|servants of civil masters]]. and they will do what they are told by people who would never go to war. that's called a democracy.|[http://atrios.blogspot.com/2002/09/andrew-sullivan-who-earned-masters.html]}}
At first, Sully maintained a [[unrealistic expectations|positive outlook]] on the [[war]], and predicted the [[epic|EPIC]] [[FAIL]] of the traitorous [[hippies]], and the [[fail|victory]] of the [[unwarranted self-importance|brave]] pro-war [[blog|bloggers]].
{{quote|If this war continues as well as it has been, won’t the anti-war left not merely be defeated but beyond humiliated?|[http://sullywatch.blogspot.com/2006_03_19_archive.html#114288846423621607#114288846423621607]}}
God forbid he neglect to pat himself on the back for his [[internet tough guy|courage]].
{{quote|The men and women in our armed forces did the hardest work. They deserve our immeasurable thanks. But we all played our part. By facing down the evil, the cowardly and the simply misguided, we have done a great good.|[http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_03_05_archive.html#114159068592087750]}}

Sometime [[last thursday]], Sully decided that he had fought long enough and had made enough brave selfless sacrifice. He grew bored of being a pro-war [[troll]] and decided it would [[lulz|lulzier]] and more [[profit|profitable]] to be goddamn [[hippy]]. He made a complete 180 and denounced his former hero, [[W|George W]] as the master of all [[funny|evil]]. Now Sullivan is an insufferable [[why do you hate America?|America-hating]] [[cock|prick]] who regularly congratulates himself for his [[hypocrisy|courage]] and refers to people who hold the same view that he held a short while ago as "[[coward|cowards]]."

== Torturing a Dead Horse ==
Andrew Sullivan has near superhuman empathy with the victims of [[torture]]. Whenever anyone, anywhere in the world is tortured, his butt begins to tingle and [[butthurt|hurt]]. It doesn't matter whether the victim is being water-boarded, fed feet first through a wood-chipper, or simply wrapped in the [[Israeli]] flag; St. Andrew can feel his pain. Because of this, Sully must blog [[at least 100]] times a week about [[torture]], or his empathic powers will overwhelm his already fragile [[AIDS|herpes]]-addled brain and drive him [[insane]]. That is, more insane than he already is.

== Batshit ==

Andrew Sullivan is now one of the most prominent purveyors of [[batshit insane|insanity]] on the [[internets]] today. Examples of some some of the crazy he's tried to sell:
