The Ugly Barnacle
[[File:TheUglyBarnacle.png|center]]

'''The Ugly Barnacle''' is a motivational story told by [[Fatass|Patrick Star]] in order to cheer up his friend [[Spongebob]], who currently believes he is ugly because everyone runs away from him, and he is too [[retarded]] to realize it's because his breath smells like [[shit]]. Although [[Some argue|many claim]] that the story doesn't help at all, one ought to take comfort in that fact that no matter how ugly they are, they'll never be as ugly as the ugly barnacle. Be happy knowing that there's a barnacle [[lie|uglier]] than [[you]].
