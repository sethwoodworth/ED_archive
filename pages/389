Alt.syntax.tactical
alt.syntax.tactical is a [[awesome|notable]] [[usenet]] trolling organization, closely affiliated with [[homosexual|alt.flaming]] and [[alt.fan.karl-malden.nose]]. The newsgroup is commonly associated with the [[Meow Wars]], despite not playing a primary role in the proceedings.

They are known for their methodical rapage of [[pwned|unsuspecting newsgroups]]. They use a time-tested plan, which goes a bit like this, foo:

#alt.syntax.tactical scours the herd of groups, and picks [[shit nobody cares about|one that is either lame, old, young, or separated from the group]].
#a.s.t marshals some trolls to infiltrate the group and become [[BFF|friendly]] with the target. This is called Group 1.
#a.s.t sends in a [[mantrain|second wave of trolls]] to start a [[flame|flamewar]] with the moles who have already invaded the unknowing group. This wave is called Group 2.
#The two groups of trolls then start flaming eachother, trying to draw others to the defense of Group 1. If they are lucky the flames will get [[goatse|too big]] to be fanned out, and will rage within the group for months to come. Serves the morons right for defending people on the internets, aye?
#a.s.t continues to send in wave after wave of trolls in order to reduce the group to a steaming pile of [[internets]] shit.

Most newsgroups last 3 or 4 waves, and none last beyond 5 or 6. [[1337]]ness personified.

==Common tactics==
*Crossposting
*[[Spam]]ming

A.s.t, being the sadistic [[cunt]]s they are, consider a group [[fuck]]ed when:

*All names appear in killfiles
*Majority or ALL threads in invaded newsgroup were started by a.s.t.      
*[[wikibreak|Regulars/legit people abandon invaded newsgroup]]
*They receive much hate mail - as does their SysAdmin
