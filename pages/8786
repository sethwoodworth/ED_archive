'''Vicious Dog Man''', also called ''Psycho Dog Man, Barking Dog Man'' or simply ''Dog Man'', is a [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]] [[meme]] instigated from an episode of ''A Current Affair'' (some shitty [[Australian]] "current affairs" show) on April 12th, [[2010]]. The episode featured a story about a couple of [[dogs]] roaming a neighbourhood and holding residents in fear. '''Ray Graham''' ''spoke out'' about the dogs, providing viewers with a [[ROFL|funny-as-fuck]] re-enactment of the dogs' behavior. Since being played on [[YouTube]], Ray's re-enactment has achieved smallish [[meme]] status and has even acquired a couple [[Facebook]] dedication pages.

==The Original Video==
[[File:Viciousdogmanbeware.jpg|thumb|Get it?]]
Be sure to watch out for the re-action of the woman in the video, who is Ray's wife. One would argue that is the ''only'' funny thing about the video.

Some people thought this was [[Facepalm|so fuckin' funny]] that it needed a few dedication pages on Facebook. If you also thought this was funny, [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Vicious-Dog-Man/113394535352297 join those pages] and laugh with like minded people about how he goes: RAAARAARARRGRAH.

==Some Remixes==

==ACA Follow Up==
As they say, a win will eventually become a fail. Perhaps this came all too soon, as the ACA re-interviewed Ray and asked him to do another impression. After watching the video, you are guaranteed to stop giving a shit about this entire incident, as they have effectively killed any lulz by trying to turn them back into news, IE: "This person became an internet celebrity, let's ask them [[Shit Nobody Cares About|how they feel!"]]
