'''TinEye Reverse Image Search''' is a pretty [[awesome|cool]] search engine that lets you upload an image, then find it somewhere on the [[internet]]. It crawls the interwebs to find out how the image is being used, where it came from, and can even find modified versions of it. You can also get a plug-in for it so you can search for images just by right-clicking them. Plug-ins for both [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Shit|Internet Explorer]], and [[Chrome]] are available.

[[Some argue]] that you can use it to find edited versions of your [[original content|original artwork]]—[[Tracing|possibly palette swaps]]—by uploading your image. It's [[Shit|not that great]], so you probably won't find any of that [[CP]] you wanted, you [[Sick Fuck|sicko]].

==Shittiness==

TinEye is a piece of [[shit]] [[Newbie|so far]], but you can help by [http://tineye.com/submit_website submitting websites] for it to [[Rape|crawl]]. Hopefully, the people who review the submitted websites aren't [[Fundies|conservative Christians]] who want to censor [[Pedobear|everything]] [[Goatse|that]] [[Tubgirl|threatens]] [[Lemon Party|the]] [[Pain Series|safety of their children]]. You can, however, upload gory images of crime scenes and get results, so censorship doesn't seem too likely.
