Megaphone Desktop Tool

{{notice|Obviously, the '''Megaphone Desktop Tool''' is made of hebe and [[FAIL]] or this page would have moar page views.}}

Controlling a [[hivemind]] is a terribly tough task, even for a conspiracy as complex as the Jews.  Luckily for them, they have a few programmers that were able to devise a tool to keep their useful idiots in check.  They call it the "Megaphone Desktop [[cock|Tool.]]"  [[File:Megaphone_screenshot.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Tool]].]]

Basically, the Tool works just like any other desktop popup virus.  Check it out:

# You get an urgent email from the Jews asking you to "support Israel."
# You click the link, and the Tool is downloaded straight to your [[system32]] folder.
# Every time there's an online poll about Israel, the Tool pops up, opens your [[Internet_Explorer|web browser]], and automatically votes pro-Jew.
# ????
# Jews profit!

Importantly, the Israeli Foreign Ministry supports the Tool.  It's always good to know that you have OFFICIAL APPROVAL when you're a Jew patsy.  Ironically, even though the Tool reminds you to "Voice your opinion" on its popups, it always automatically votes the way the Israeli Foreign Ministry commands it to.  It's probably just as well, considering [[you]] aren't capable of forming your own opinion anyhow.

Being the Jews they are, the creators of the Tool formed an actual company, "Collactive," to sell the tools to other people for their hivemind control activities.  [[fact|An opportunity to profit never escapes a Jew.]]  Collactive was founded using cash from such Jews as Don Valentine, Roelof Botha (the CFO of PayPal and a board member of [[Meebo]]), and Michael Moritz (former board member of [[Google]]).

Excellently, the Lebanese did a [[troll]] on the Jews by hacking the Tool to vote against Israel.

<!-- I need to work on this translation More and more people are wondering how it is that as soon as an Internet news portal with forums and/or comments publishes stuff about Israel that users are critical of, there is suddenly a majority of comments in which Israel's extremist Zionist policy is praised in glowing terms and defended and justified to the max shortly thereafter.

This is not a coincidence!

The Israeli Foreign Ministry has instructed staff to monitor Web sites and Internet forums and alert groups of Jewish activists/Zionists in the U.S. and Europe to websites with material that's not supportive of Israel or promoting Zionist policy in order to spam them with pro-Zionist comments or to rig polls in favour of Israel. To this end, special software was developed: the Megaphone Desktop Tool.

'''The Megaphone Desktop Tool''' is a [[Microsoft Windows]] program, which the World Union of Jewish Students and other Zionist/pro-Israel organizations gives away through the site '''giyus.org'''. The software was published on July 19, 2006 and delivers to its users, in real-time, notifications on important articles, videos, blogs and surveys so their users and can disseminate their views en masse in order to support Israel's Zionist policy on the public opinion front.

Be careful!

This tool connects to a server of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and then gets a list of publications critical of Israel and sends out "Alerts". In this way, the Israeli Zionist government can quickly tell a large number of people and direct them to the specified site. There they will be able to flood forums and comments with pro-Israeli Zionist opinion and manipulate polls and surveys. For the ignorant it then looks like there is a broad level of agreement on Israel's extremist Zionist policy.

It is also observed that not prevent some operators from news portals with a forum and/or comments to plug this type of manipulation of opinion (with ethnic-hatred, war glorification glorification of genocide and ideologies of eugenics and euthanasia are not rare), not even if they for example, be made by the normal Userschaft urges attention!-->


{{quote|Expect plenty of coordinated downmods for any criticism of Israel. [[Digg]] has already been victimized by [[jews|these creeps]] and [[reddit]] is under attack. As for the self post, dummy submissions have been made to reddit to block linking and exposing this disturbing bit of neo-fascism. American patriots, be on your guard! Israel is stuffing our government with their minions to continue taking [[Jew Gold|billions of our dollars]] yearly, committing our troops to death fighting [[Zionism]]'s enemies in the Middle East and now subverting our free speech in cyberspace.|[http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/8foq0/the_megaphone_desktop_tool_is_a_weapon_of_the/ reddit]}}
