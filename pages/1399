Centipede filled vagina
{{warning|[[Not to be confused with|This is '''not''']] [[X? In My Y?]]}}

[[Image:centipedes.jpg|thumb|right|[[X? In My Y?|Probably the most famous incarnation]] of the centipede-filled vagina [[meme]].]]An [[old meme]] which originated with Erik at [http://www.oldmanmurray.com/ Old Man Murray], [[Shit nobody cares about|who went on to be one of the writers for Valve games like]] [[Portal]]. The phrase rapidly became the popular subject of [[image macro]]s and [[photoshop]]s, many of varying quality.

==What to do if you find a nest of centipedes in your vagina==
[[Image:centipedectomy.jpg|thumb|right|This woman found centipedes in HER vagina, but fortunately [[nope|help is at hand...]]]]

# Don't panic.  [[factual inaccuracy|Studies show]] that 1 out of 3 [[women]] have centipedes or centipede-like-creatures in their [[vagina]]s.
# If you are a [[man]] and discover that you not only have a [[vagina]], but that it is filled with centipedes, you may wish to panic a little.
# Centipedes are insectivores.  In order to entice the centipedes to leave your vagina, you may wish to try the following fun home [[Ghey|Blue Peter]]-esque project:
## You will need a tampon, a cockroach, some Scotch tape, and a centipede-filled vagina.  If you are under 18, be sure to ask your parents' permission before attempting to remove centipedes from your vagina.
## Tape the cockroach to the tampon and insert it into your centipede-filled vagina.
## Slowly (and if possible, erotically) pull the string until the be-cockroached tampon slides out of your centipede-filled vagina.
## If you are lucky, one or more centipedes will have gone for the bait and evacuated your now slightly less centipede-filled vagina.  Repeat until you are satisfied with the centipede density in your vagina.
## Helpful hint: since all centipedes are [[azn]], if they are not taking the bait it may be helpful to cater to their particular tastes.  You may want to soak the tampon in soy sauce, or use [[Pocky]] instead of a tampon.  Avoid at all costs the temptation to substitute General Tso's chicken for the cockroach.  Your [[vagina]] will thank you.
# Should you need to enlist the help of others, be sure to state in a loud, clear voice that there are centipedes inside you.  This will cause them to ask where, and give you the opportunity to mutter "in mah [[vagina]]" semi-coherently like Hillary Swank in ''Boys Don't Cry''.  That's always funny.

==Other places to find centipedes==
According to a less-[[funny]] encyclopedia, centipedes can generally be found in tropical climates and in caves of the non-vaginal variety.  However, considering that said encyclopedia made the centipede [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipede its mascot], they are no better than [[furries]] and thus not to be trusted.

[[Dramacrat]]ic researchers have made preliminary efforts to locate nests of centipedes in [[mangina]]s, primarily by inserting [[rfjason]] into [[Dgt]]'s rectum on centipede-hunting expeditions.  However, to date, [[vagina]]s remain the only confirmed habitat of centipedes.

==There are centipedes in my vagina and I'm not afraid to use them==
Like everything else that comes into or out of your [[vagina]], centipedes entitle you, as a [[woman]], to special treatment.  It is therefore your Goddess-given right&mdash;nay, verily, your ''duty''&mdash;to mention your centipede-filled vagina at all opportunities.  You should assume that everyone who disagrees with you, makes fun of you, or fails to buy you things from your [[wishlist]] does so because he is prejudiced against you due to your centipede-filled vagina.  

The key to making your centipede-filled vagina into an effective bargaining tool is to bring attention to it as loudly as possible.  Some suggested options are "JUST BECAUSE I HAVE A NEST OF CENTIPEDES IN MY VAGINA DOESN'T MEAN I'M ANY LESS OF A PERSON!" or "YOUR CENTIPEDE-FILLED VAGINA WOULDN'T FIT INTO AN [[MRI]] EITHER!"
