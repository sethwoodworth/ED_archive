'''[[Wikipedia:User talk:68.39.174.238|68.39.174.238]]''' (colloquially [[Jesus Christ|Jesus Fucking Christ]]) is Wikipedia's most prevalent [[anonymous]] editor. IP 68.39.174.238 has over 23,080 contributions, suggesting that he has no life, is a [[robot]], or is simply a [[Wikipedo]] looking for his [[unwarranted self-importance|15 minutes of fame]]. Although he appears to be a giant [[nerd]], his [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Don't-give-a-fuck|attitude]] towards the [[Ignore All Rules|hypocritical "by the rules"]] users suggest that he is one of the few legendary Wikipedians that might possibly fail to [[die alone]].

==The End Of An Era==
[[Wikipedia:Requiescat in pace|RIP]] 68.39.174.238 (September 26, 2005 â€” December 3, 2008). The Jews at [[Comcast]] have reassigned this fine stranger to [[Wikipedia:User:76.117.247.55|76.117.247.55]]. Check out his [[Wikipedia:User_talk:76.117.247.55|new talk page]] to see uptight [[cunts]] whine about how '''[[Ignore All Rules|OMFG HE'S BREAKING THE UNWRITTEN RULES!!!!]]'''
