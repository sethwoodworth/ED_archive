Wtf omgz

'''{{ljcomm|user=wtf_omgz}}'' is the furry-free alternative to [[Wtf_inc]]. The maintainers possess a more intelligent form of moderation, where they are active enough in the community to immediately seek out trouble and bring down the [[Banhammer]] on deserving [[asshole]]s.  The maintainers of '''Wtf_omgz''' also have a slightly smaller stick up their ass regarding posts, i.e. they aren't whiny [[cunts]] and the decision of whether or not to use an [[LJ-cut]] is up to the original poster. The only criteria is that the subject matter be sufficiently [[wtf]]-worthy. '''Wtf_omgz''' also encourages mockery of the unfortunate individuals who happen across the community by obvious accident, which includes but is not limited to [[furries]], posters of normality, and posters of the ever-dreaded [[old meme]].

As of June 2008, '''wtf_omgz''' has over 3300 members.


== Maintainers ==

'''Wtf_omgz''' is maintained by the users {{lj|hate_engine9}} and {{lj|kittydoom}}.


== Whiners ==

Whiners, like posters of [[old]] [[memes]], are generally regarded with the utmost hatred. It is not uncommon for members to break down and [[cry]] when confronted with the wrath of the members who are better at life than them.

== The Great Pwning of '06 ==

A lonely [[old]] man going by the username  {{lj|madincleveland}} was [[troll]]ing around various communities on [[LJ]]. He caught the attention of {{lj|hate_engine9}} (formerly ilovescabs) and {{lj|kittydoom}} in the {{ljcomm|randompics}} community. He flooded the place with inane posts about [[guns]] and movies, highlighted by scrolling text and absurdly poor spelling. He was [[banned]], but kept circumventing those bans by using one of his many [http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_omgz/677093.html puppet accounts]. Aggreived about being caught, he launched a pathetic attempt to flood '''Wtf_omgz''', but failed as all of his accounts had been preemptively banned. Excessively long story short, {{lj|kittydoom}} and {{lj|hate_engine9}} gathered ridiculously large amounts of evidence against him, and after violating a no contact restriction issued by [[LJ Abuse]], all but one of his accounts were [http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_omgz/691313.html permanently suspended].

== Sissyfight '07 ==

The first real drama of 2007 came with the posting of an image of a sissy man wearing a [http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v23/blazeomatic/dieinafire/AliceSK1.jpg frilly girl's dress]. {{lj|crystastarlight}} decided to be a [[bitch]] and call LJ support, leading the cooler members of '''wtf_omgz''' to laugh and point. Originally, everyone assumed {{lj|crystastarlight}} was just being an [[asshole]] and thought that everyone was laughing at the sissy man because he looked ridiculous. Upon further investigation by {{lj|kittydoom}}, it was discovered that {{lj|crystastarlight}} was not only the moderator of the sissy community, but had a really fucked up face. Many [[lulz]] ensued. 

As a result of the drama, {{lj|crystastarlight}}, aka [http://www.myspace.com/57195069 ChristieLuv] aka {{Deviantart||AdultBabyDiaperGal|AdultBabyDiaperGal}}, has locked down sections of the [http://www.sissykiss.com/ SissyKiss] [http://www.sissykiss.com/forum/ message board] in an attempt to block access to the [[lulz]]. Fortunately, the members of '''wtf_omgz''' are clever motherfuckers and have been scavenging the rest of the site to find more hilarity.

== The Great Butthurt of June '07 ==

Local stupid [[bitch]] {{lj|pixelateme}} stumbled upon the livejournal of trashy-[[racist]]-[[goth]]-thing {{lj|saint_amaimon}} and discovered many [[lulz]] lurked within, mainly through photographs such as the one demonstrated to your left. Pixelate decides instant cool points [[A winner is you|would be won]] by posting his pictures on WTFOMGZ as she giggles sadistically behind the safety of her computer screen. [http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_omgz/1507865.html So she does just that]. [[Over 9000|Over 200]] comments are instantly received as St. Amaiamaiamamaimamon quickly responds to every fucking post with many [[Emo|deep]], [[Crap|gothic]] phrases such as [http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_omgz/1507865.html?thread=18831641#t18831641 "Pig fucker."]

[http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_omgz/1507865.html?thread=18856985#t18856985 Halfway through the comments], it is somehow revealed that Pixelate is actually a [[16-year-old girl|15-year-old girl]]. This leads the biggest badass of them all {{lj|kittydoom}} to ban her ass so fast that her [[loli]]tastic tits manage to jiggle a little for the first time in her life. As usual, a severe case of [[butthurt]] is quickly developed by the preteen, and she creates spare account after spare account so that she may leave just ONE more comment in revolt against the mods before being banned again and again, over and over and OVER as displayed by the suspiciously-named accounts all over [http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_omgz/1507865.html?page=2#comments page 2], such as {{lj|underagebanned}} and {{lj|banned4lyf}}. Eventually she gives up and goes running off to [[MySpace]] where people will appreciate her [[Shit nobody cares about|ultra-funny cynical remarks.]]

Is it over yet?
lolololo...

<big>NO</big>

[[You]] all seem to have forgotten that [[16-year-old girls]] are ruthless, and have many a lacky trailing behind them. User {{lj|dirtylittlecity}} is [[Shocked and Appalled]] upon hearing of her best internet friend ever being banned from a community that clearly states in the rules that if you're underage b&, you get [[Ban|b&]]. So she cuts and pastes Pixelate's original post and [http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_omgz/1510262.html tweaks it a bit]. The thing is, posting a bunch of pics of a [[sexy]] [[azn]] [[whore]] isn't really going to offend anyone, especially when you do it with this as your icon:
