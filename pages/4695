[[Image:Lmgtfy1.jpg|thumb|A typical [[noob]]'s response.]]
[http://www.lmgtfy.com/ Let me Google that for you] is a <s>site</s> tool designed to [[pwn]] [[noobs]] with a single blow. Typically it goes like this ;

# [[Noob]] asks stupid question on a [[forum]] or [[IM]]
# [[Pro]] goes to lmgtfy.com
# Pro inserts the noob's stupid question
# Pro sends noob the LMGTFY link
# Pro sits back, enjoying the noob's retarded [[ALL CAPS]] response. Examples include ; "omgg FUCK YOU[[oneoneone|!!!!!!1]]" , "OH U THINK UR [[Clever|CLEVER]]??" and "[[derp]]".
