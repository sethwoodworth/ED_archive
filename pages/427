Love is a beautiful and tender thing- especially when it presents itself in psychotic stalking and obsession. Then love blossoms into something more, something greater; into [[lulz]]. Thus we come to Amy Steele and her former paramour Brian Shofer. Like many a man before him, Brian thought with his cock and started banging Amy Steele. Amy herself says she's been [[batshit insane]] since she was about sixteen and sees a therapist and psychiatrist regularly. She says herself she is going to attend DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) which is used as a tool to control Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Looking at her behavior, it's fairly easy to see this side of her. Brian, on the other hand, was too much of a dumb fuck to read a couple paragraphs on BPD and not get involved with someone that could potentially kill him. Good job, bro. Thank you [[evolution]].

==A Reasonable Response==
After a decade of attempting to support, help, and love this cunt Brian finally decided that he could not deal with it anymore. [[Mental illness]] is extremely difficult for normals to deal with, something that the [[batshit insane]] don't often take into account or are unable to empathize with. She states herself that he was able to list off all the jobs that she was unable to hold. Which makes it fairly clear he actually cared enough for a long time to try and help her. After a decade, he likely thought things were not going to get better and opted to find another fuck-hole.

Brian knew that he could no longer have contact with her in any form. Those with BPD tend to be [[Anonymous|obsessive and destructive in pursuit of their own fulfillment at the expense of all else.]] So he informed her to have no more contact with him and did exactly that. Her response was to start a blog and bash him, call him out, give out personal information both in [[dox]] form and sexually. This blog found it's way to [[reddit]] which is the time it started blowing up harder as more people were drawn in like flies to [[shit]]. 

<strike>She responded by [[baleet]]ing the blog.</strike>

January 2010, she discovered that Brian and his wife were expecting a baby. Since she was unable to make the baby shower, she decided to revive all her [http://www.brianschofertheemotionlessengineer.blogspot.com deleted blogs].

|I put up this site and these posts (many are very sweet).|[[Stalking]] usually is.
|I dumped my pony's manure in his driveway and left a note that said: "If you treat me like shit, you get shit."|At least it wasn't on his porch.
|I filled up his VM with phone calls.| Very mature.
|I tried to break into his house to get some of my stuff and I have a huge scar on my wrist because my hand went through the window. I told him about it immediately. I could have just let him think someone else did it.|[[LOL|Very likely he would have thought it was random.]]
|I hung a barbie from his new Prius with a bag around her neck.|Getting into some interesting territory.
|I tried to cancel his BHH reservation for NYE b/c I had stayed there with him five times and didn't want him staying with someone else.|[[truth|They'll probably lose it anyways.]]

Amy is a [[liberal]] [[feminist]] intent on throwing off the shackles of her male oppressors by being a strong-willed role model of a woman for the younger generation. [[DISREGARD THAT]]. Amy is a [[liberal]] [[feminist]] who conformed to every backwards ass personality quirk that Brian had thus pretty much rendering her beliefs stupid. 

{{squote|7. A few weeks ago, Brian essentially left me to die. I punched my hand through a window and texted and called him for nearly an hour that I needed a ride to BIDMC because I felt like I was going to pass out and didn't want to do that while driving. What is his takeaway? "You drove to my work to look for me." Well, FU Brian. Thanks for caring that I could have hit an artery and bled out. Perhaps next time, I will hit the right spot and just pass out and die. Would that make you happy? So SELFISH on your part. You used to CARE about me but when I needed you in a medical emergency you continued to IGNORE me.|[[Baw|BAWWWWWWWW]]}}

The bitch bleeds fivish days a month and is worried about a little hour of bleeding? A rational person reading this would be thinking, "An hour? Why didn't you just call an [[Epic Beard Man|AMBER LAMPS]]?" It is important to note that people with BPD are generally not rational when they've been slighted. It's only about them and what is going on in their mind. Her manipulations didn't accomplish her goal so instead she must villify Brian to wound him since he wounded her.

{{squote|Brian Schofer gave me this key to use his truck and can be so stubborn. I moved his truck (the geek was never in a fraternity or didn't go to MIT--where there are also fraternities) so didn't see the humor or the "how did she do that?" in it. Instead he talked about Grand Theft Auto etc. But he GAVE me the key. I'm willing to give i back under certain circumstances.|[[Stalking]] IS humorous.}}

He gave her the key while under the presumption that the pair were on friendly terms. So of course it's perfectly okay if she uses it now to break into his property.

{{squote|7. To make myself feel better, I punctured Brian's condoms with a pin and hope that he gets stuck with a child. He's be a miserable father. He barely likes children and cannot even talk to his nieces and nephews. Pathetic.|This would typically get you killed in most situations.}}

{{squote|WHAT ARE YOU P-WHIPPED THAT YOU GOT INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO TALK TO ME OR DO ANYTHING WITH ME? THAT SEEMS SO UNLIKE YOU TO ANSWER TO A WOMAN. TO LISTEN TO A WOMAN. YOU REALLY MUST HAVE NEEDED SEX BAD. HOW LONG HAD IT BEEN BRIAN SINCE YOU PUT YOUR COCK IN A PUSSY? SIX YEARS?|Maybe he's gay? [[faggot|Closet-case self-loather]].}}

==The Handy J==
[[Image:Amyfemi1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Setting women back for 40 years and counting.]]
{{squote|Brian loves boobs. Loves to suck them, lick them, stroke and pinch my nipples etc and I have big ones: 36C. Usually while I gave him a Handy J, he’d lick and suck my tits [thus the reason he would be on top while I gave him a handy J—boob access]. I would lube him up and off I’d go. [I am not giving away my special techniques and secrets. You can figure them out on your on but mine work! Guys really dig them]. I would keep going—stroking in my special style, fondling his balls and letting him suck my tits until he would finally cum.|Alert the [[internets]], [[truth|men love tits]].}}

In her attempts to villify Brian, Amy has decided to post information about their sex life on the internet. This very enlightened and obviously intelligent woman seems to have missed the memo that anything you put on the internet basically stays there. I'm sure future employers will be very interested when doing a check on her and discovering her behavior. 

{{squote|Brian takes a good 45 minutes to cum with oral sex and sometimes doesn't even come with intercourse: it's called sexual dysfunction. It's a problem/ issue. I KNOW I'm excellent at giving oral sex... I've been complimented so many times. Some guys have been totally blown away at my acumen at giving head.|I'd hire her.}}

A compliment on a blowjob is like thanking someone for giving you a thousand dollars. You're going to do it anyways in the hopes you'll get another blowjob/thousand dollars. The former men that were attached to the dicks she sucked are the most unreliable way to verify this. As an [[EDiot]] and chronicler of the [[lulz]], I am willing to make the sacrifice of letting this slut blow me to give you an accurate assessment of her fellating skills. We [[EDiot]]s are willing to make those kind of sacrifices for accuracy and for the [[lulz]].

{{squote|The Handy J (as Chelsea Handler likes to refer to it), or hand-job. is an art form. And I’m pretty good at them. I’ve got some special tricks and techniques that I like to use to give the guy I’m with complete pleasure and a full release. I know how to use my hands to their greatest capacity and have an excellent skill set sexually. Brian... loved to get a Handy J in the morning. All through our 8-year-long friendship I continued to give him hand jobs. I was getting sex from guys I was dating over the years. He didn't date anyone all that time.|Every 16 year old boy is [[TMNT|Michelangelo]].}}

==The Importance of Medication==
<center>{{morphquote|AmySt2|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;
|You don't care if I get better through DBT in controlling my emotions because then you won't have the full power over me that you had in the past. You like to control women. It makes you feel better about your inadequacies.|Either that or is he gay.
|I'm not making excuses but my new psychiatrist believes I've been on the WRONG MEDS for a year.|Fun times in looney land.
|}}</center>

The [[batshit insane]] need a correct medication cocktail to control the errant ways their brains behave. Being on the wrong medication, an insufficient dosage, or not taking your medication can result in much insanity that normally would not have come to pass. It is admirable that Amy is still struggling to find the correct dosages and therapy she needs to be a functional individual. Make no mistake, this should never be permitted to be an easy opt out for anyone. She wrongly believes, like many mentally ill, that since her brain is broken then she should somehow be above some basic standards of behavior and decency. Simply because one is mentally ill does not entitle to them privilege for their bullshit. This is why the Temporary Insanity defense is almost never used in the courts. They must still be held accountable for their actions. Understanding can be given out, yes. Clearly Brian has reached the end of his ability to be understanding.

==Suicide for Attention==
If you are looking to call attention to yourself and have no problems with joking about suicidal, by all means hit the Massachusetts Governor's [[Twitter]] feed and leave some comments. And then of course, be enraged when someone tried to help her by contacting authorities to assist her.

[[Image:Selfpwnagesmall.gif|thumb|right|150px|Shoulda got on MassGov first.]]
The Tweets that got her [[V&]] for her own good.

<center>{{morphquote|AmySt3|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;
|Breakfast of the depressed. Tea and 2 clonipin. -- amusing to me. I'm a Bostonian. Others perhaps not so much|That's it? Just two?
|Does anyone know a suicide hotline # or good Samaritans. I need to talk -- I wrote this at 3 a.m. because who is up for me to call except those who answer hotlines.|Amazing how many numbers googling Suicide Hotline turns up.
|You'd think I'm planning to disappear as I'm giving things away, getting rid of things.-- Yes, you'd THINK but I'm NOT. I'm purging for my move.|Not at all suspicious behavior from someone claiming to be suicidal.
|<small>My situation is hopeless at this point. 40, single, a MS degree, CMA, no job, just lousy. nothing to live for. @MassGovernor-- I thought the governor should KNOW that his STATE sucks right now and isn't very helpful to me if I can't find a job and am so educated but they call the PO PO instead of getting in touch with me?</small>|Not suicidal at all.
|and ps. @MassGovernor my threat was a JOKE.-- wow. this seems straight forward.|In your mind it probably did, your mind isn't well.
|Do I really want to apply for food stamps? I'm a member of the MFA, ISGM, ICA, Coolidge Corner Theatre. Is that someone on food stamps?-- just stating reality here. It's not pretty.|Eating out of a dumpster and begging are not better.
|All my friends from college are scattered around the US and world (Tunisia). It's really lonely/miserable.-- Of course this is true and it's reality.|[[Why So Srs]] and defensive?
|What do you do when the person you talk to most doesn't want anything to do with you anymore?-- the main source of my depression|Get over it and move on?
|Oh and if I'm so depressed why have I done recent interviews with Jonathan Lethem, Chris Bohjalian, Katherine Howe, Barbara Delinsky, Courtney Sullivan and Jessica Shattuck|Who the fuck are these people? part 1
|and have upcoming interviews with Rachel True, Rian Johnson (Brothers Bloom), Tiffany Thiessen, Mary Karr, Jennie Shortridge and Lisa Tucker?|Who the fuck are these people? part 2
|}} </center>


So apparently she spoke with a woman at the governor's office who had her information and informed the [[cop]]s that she had someone who was suicidal asking if they knew a hitman which Amy thought was sarcastic enough to not be taken seriously. The woman refused to give her name over to Amy, and understandably so. Nutcases usually leave a lot of collateral damage in their wake. Miss Steele was forcibly restrained and [[BAW]]ed on her blog about the bruises she got from the cuffs they used on her. But yet, no one gives a shit about her to bother trying to keep her alive.

[[Image:Pills and thrills.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Needs moar of these.]]
{{squote|So I've been depressed more than usual. I'm clinically depressed and have anxiety like many well-known writers (William Syron, David Foster Wallace, Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath, Virginia Woolf etc.) and I've seen a wonderful therapist for six years and also see a psychiatrist for meds.|Sigh.}}

People like this cunt are why the mentally ill are so drastically misunderstood. They cite famous people that worked through their mental illness but it always comes off as "I'm as special as these people!" Which they are not and most of the time they know they are not. Her citing of her pedigree of a Masters in Journalism and her being brought up in some shit-hole around [[Boston]] reinforces this further in the eyes of the reader. Instead of using her energy to fulfill her ambitions to succeed despite her difficulties she instead spends it on stalking some dumb fuck who got tired of her Handy J's. The difference between the people like Amy and the writers she cited as being mentally ill are those writers cast their sorrow into their work and turned it into something that lasted. [[fuck you|You other faggots just attention whore and make it harder for other mentally ill to adjust.]]

==Sympathy for Brian==
This [[EDiot]] feels that this warrants its own special mention. Various contributors on different websites have expressed deep sympathy for Brian and what he is going through dealing with Amy.

<center>{{morphquote|AmySt4|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;
|Poor Brian. On the bright side, since this went viral yesterday, he's certainly got all he needs for a restraining order. His company should get one, as well.|Poor Brian indeed.
|Brian sounds like a levelheaded guy that saw a bad situation and avoided it before it costed him his life (aka crazy woman kills him, then self more than likely). Do us all a favor and just move on, except not on to someone else. You need to be alone and work on your shit with therapy and medication and let professionals decide when your ready.|Yep, after ten years.
|Bloody fucking Hell, this woman is batshit insane.
I'd do anything to keep myself away from people even remotely like this. I'd have disappeared from the face of the earth if I was the guy. Poor dude.|We're all around you.
|If you Google his name, this is like the 2nd and the 5th thing that shows up. I feel terrible for the man when he goes on interviews.|Pity hire ftw?
|I feel so bad for that guy.. This woman is clearly insane.|Indeed.
|}} </center>


Fuck Brian. Fuck. Brian. Neither of these two deserve pity or sympathy. She said herself she has been being treated for mental issues since she was sixteen in the form of doctors and medication. There is no way that he could not have known the difficulties she was going through or had gone through. He made the choice to be with her despite her being Borderline. His own ignorance of the disease and what it can potentially do is why he's going through this shit now. 

[[Image:God Warrior Marge.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Just as sane as this bitch.]]
{{squote|To those who called me insane, crazy etc. you really should be ashamed of yourselves. Mental illness is serious and I've suffered from it since I was 16. Brian knew that when we dated and while we were friends. Yes, I have a therapist and psychiatrist. So do 60% of Americans and many just go untreated.|Amy defending her bullshit.}}

[[O RLY]].

[[Image:Kidfinger1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Even this kid gets it.]]
{{squote|If I REALLY WANTED TO KILL MYSELF, I WOULD HAVE ALREADY DONE IT. I'VE BEEN DEPRESSED SINCE I WAS PROB. 12 YEARS OLD AND ON MEDS SINCE 18. NO ONE KNOWS MY STRUGGLES. MY MOM IS STILL ALIVE AND MY DEATH WOULD DEVASTATE HER.|So is it 60% of Americans or is it nobody?}}

Fuck Amy too. She knows her mind isn't well or healthy completely but she refuses to trust the word of someone that DID care about her to help guide her through it and continue looking. They're perfect for each other. Both [[ignorant]] as fuck. Stalk on psycho bitch. Stalk on.

==Et tu, Mr. Destructo?==
An enterprising individual made it a point to bring some attention to Amy and her shenanigans on his blog and wrote a bit on the highlights of her tirades. Amy was either pointed to or found the blogs and decided to attempt to defend herself. It appears as though this is the point she decided to [[delete fucking everything]].

{{squote|Where's your real name? For someone criticizing me, you're a hypocrite and ludicrous. 

Some of the posts were written late at night and it's a bloody BLOG. I'm not trying to be the perfect writer on there. It was a way to vent to one person and about one person. Get it. 

I didn't know the book thing meme is about cat ladies. Only impotent men are afraid of them. How silly.

The blogger returns fire by dissecting her post and pointing out some of her batshit insane behavior. [http://www.mrdestructo.com/2010/02/meet-craziest-woman-in-world-with.html/ Sauce.]
