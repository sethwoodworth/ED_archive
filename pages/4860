'''''Linerider''''' is an online web game that lets you draw a line and then watch a guy on a sled ride the line to his death. This may seem [[lulzy]] at first, but play the game and you'll discover that in reality it's actually very, very [[gay]]. 
While at first it required actual time and effort to create a nice track, now every [[you|loser]] on the internet can create one. 
Now tracks are only considered good if you've spend at least [[over 9000|100]] hours trying to decorate your shitty track with useless lines to make it seem less shitty. For some reason it became so popular that it was created into an actual game for the console with 100% more fail and so many easy to put decorations you can't even see the fucking line he's riding on anymore. Of course [[bullshit|it makes perfect sense]] to buy a game you can just play online for free.

==Some examples==
''This is what you want your track to look like, just give it up now, it will never happen, no, [[SRSLY]]''
