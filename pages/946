Big Dog
{{Forced Meme}}

[[Image:Big Dog.jpg|thumb|right|What's the matter? Too MEME for you?]]

'''[[Big Dog]]''' is a forced meme spawned on [[Something Awful|SA's]] FYAD, and soon went to [[4chan|4chan's]] /a/, /mu/ and finally out to /b/ with [[video games]]. The images consist of a [[Internet tough guy|cool]] dog saying something is too DEEP for you. It tries to be [[NO U]], but without the charm. The meme plays with the well-known fear of Anonymous for [[Buy A Dog|dogs]]. The sequence of using Big Dog tend to resemble this exchange:

*'''Anonymous #1:''' "''Final Fantasy 7'' sucked."
*'''Anonymous #2:''' "Don't like ''Final Fantasy 7''? What's the matter? Too DEEP for you?"

The dog itself originates from a line of t-shirts called [http://www.bigdogs.com/ Big Dogs]. The shirts have one of these ''cool'' dogs on it, along with an ''outrageous'' saying such as [[Internet tough guy|"Don't like my ATTITUDE? Take a number."]]ã€€It should also be noted that the entire Big Dog fashion line targets the severely [[fat|obese]]. It is possible that the dog image and [[rage|outrageous]] comments help [[fugly|fat]] people feel better about being huge.
