==Scientology and CRIMES==

Whenever engaging in an conversation with a [[scilon]], they will attempt to put [[you]] in [[intellectual checkmate]] by shouting ''"What are YOUR crimes?"'' They will never allow [[you]] to answer, they will just keep shouting it over and over, because as all [[cults]] know, nothing breaks people like a mindless chant.

All scilons are under the conception that anyone who is critical of their money grubbing cult is a criminal and therefore guilty of a crime. 

===Types of CRIMES===

Since [[you]] won't be allowed to answer the question, these are some of the CRIMES scilons will accuse [[you]] of:

* [[Murder]]
* [[Rape]] 
* [[baby fuck|Baby rape]]
* [[Domestic violence]]
* Assault
* [[Religious]] persecution
* <del>[[Fursecution]]</del> - Fursecution is a widely accepted way to earn your internet points.
* [[Cockblock|Cockblocking]] 
* [[Trolling]]
* Being [[fat]]
* Being [[Mexican]]
* Being a [[Nazi]]
* Being a Jew
* Being a [[irony|Nazi Jew]]
* Being a meanie 
* [[Hatred]]
* Bigotry
* Genocide
* [[Internet disease]]
* Destroying planets and/or galaxies
* Being a pornographer
* Turning invisible on purpose to deceive others
* Conspiring with foreign governments
* Working for or being a [[psychologist]]
* Working for or being a pharmacologist
* Not washing your hands after using the toilet

== Proper Form of CRIMES ==

When talking to [[scilons]] [[OL]], this is the only acceptable response to "What are '''your''' crimes?"
