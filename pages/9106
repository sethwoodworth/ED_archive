Wisdom Cat
Not nearly as well-established as Advice Dog, '''Wisdom Cat''' is the antithesis to the former. Created when one Anon just wouldn't fucking conform and wanted to be different, Advice Cat only offers reliable, helpful advice to [[netizen]]s. For this reason, and for its indirect support of an unfunny forced meme, it is made of [[fail]] and nobody uses it. Also known as '''Advice Cat'''.
