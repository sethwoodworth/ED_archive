Fail to Win

<center>This example <s>fails</s> wins!</center>

'''Failing so hard you loop back to win''', alternatively known as '''F2W''', '''Fail-to-Win''', or '''MulligaWAIT NEVERMIND''', is the act of turning a fail into a win either on purpose or through NO action on your part. The latter is usually the case, meaning that you [[a winner is you|are not a winner]], but rather the [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Crazyhump.gif luckiest son of a bitch on earth]. There many ways to pull off this powerhouse dynamo and spit in the crusty eyes of [[God]], most notably exclaiming "I did it for the lulz!" when you're about to fail/ currently ''are'' failing super hard.

Its [[apples bear|polar]] opposite, '''Win2Fail''', is also fucking hilarious, but is harder to accomplish; only true [[an hero|heroes]] can turn a big win into an epic fail.

'''[[Protip]]:''' Never try to set up a situation that will result in a '''Fail-to-Win''', that just makes you a big [[USI|attention whore]].

==[[Memes]]==
''See main article: [[Meme Combining]]''

Everyone knows the vast majority of memes are [[truth|overused, unfunny, forced, and gay]]. This also means that sometimes, [[what|reasonably fun memes]] are contaminated by the poison of horribly [[unfunny]] [[shit]]. One example:
{{Template:Addtoget|[[File:Soniamdissapointreal.gif|100px]]|[[File:Anon_partyhard.gif|200px]]|[[File:Son_I_am_party.gif|Son I am party]]}}

The result is a cringe-worthy amalgam of [[Zach Braff|Failure to make you laugh]], but Success in mildly entertaining you.

==What [[NOT]] to look for==
[[File:Downey.png|thumb|right|The only exception.]]
If you happen across something that you aren't sure about, run it by the [[TJC]], or alternatively, realize you are a [[fact|dumb fuck]] and desperately need to [[suicide|remedy the situation]]. Avoid trying to make something a '''F2W''' (or any variation) unless the forces of [[awesome]] and [[suck]] are colliding.

[[File:PureFail.jpg|thumb|left|She would be too ugly to rape if this were real. Though this is just a bad [[photoshop]], so it's a [[Epic Sword Guy|double fail]].]]

To the left is an example of what is usually misconstrued as a '''F2W'''; poorly done, unfunny, and not even a chance of having sex with it. Remember: [[tl;dr|No Fails, Fail-Fails, Wins, Win-Wins]], and for fuck's sake, NO [[Chuck Norris|CHUCK NORRIS]].

{{Rainbowsmall|NO CHUCK NORRIS}} 

He is just one of many celebrities that were [[Snob|once considered cool, but then sold out or got really gay, or always WERE GAY]]. Avoid using your [[Brett Favre|fallen idols]] when creating content under the moniker of Fail-to-Win. There is only [[No exceptions|ONE EXCEPTION]]: The [[hookers and blow|up-and-down]] career of [[Iron Man|Robert Downey Jr]], as [[Down Syndrome|Downey]] is the only celebrity in America, hell, [[Shit Nobody Cares About|even the entire world]], that has been caught [[List of sex moves|in the act]], and salvaged such an [[IDK|epic career]].
