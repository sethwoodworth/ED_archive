The '''Flying Spaghetti Monster''' is an [[old meme]] that [[atheists]] created to inflict [[pwnage]] upon [[christfags]].

==History==
When some [[Christianity|dudes]] in [[Kansas]] decided to start teaching "[[bullshit|intelligent design]]" in school, a nerd named [[sloppy tits|Bobby Henderson]] had a vision after overdosing on [[gay]] sex and started the Church of the FSM. Since [[Intelligent Design]] implies the existence of an intelligent but not necessarily omnipotent or omniscient designer, Henderson decided that he could envision a new dawn of [[fail|humanity]]. The all intelligent being can be anything imaginable. Thus, giving birth to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

Later, he wrote a letter asking [[The Man|the government]] to also teach his religion, which he called the Church of the Flying [[sloppy tits|Spaghetti]] Monster. While [[orly|barely]] [[unfunny|humorous]] at face-value, it soon lost its [[lulz]] after other [[Atheism|atheists]] latched onto it and started coming up with [[frunz|hi-larious puns]].

This visionary is still riding on the money of his creation by making an actual church and its very own ''Gospel of The Flying Spaghetti Monster'' book, but it got as old as [[Larry King]]. It indulges itself in overused [[goatse|memes]]. Apparently some of the "pastafarians" got fed up with this assbaggery and started the "''Reformed'' Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster", whatever the fuck that means. The flying spaghetti monster may be the final solution to Mama Luigi's endless quest for lotsa spaghetti, but this is still unknown because it's not like it was funny to begin with anyways.

==Atheists kill the (already nonexistent) lulz==
Self-declared "Pastafarians" cling to the idea of a flying spaghetti-monster in hopes of [[pwn]]ing [[Jesus]]-lovers everywhere. However, running around the [[internet]] saying things like "Thank FSM!" or "Ramen, brother!" betrays a hole in their soul that only <del>accepting [[Jesus]]</del> <del>a lobotomy</del> <del>eating [[Pie|pie]]</del> <del>[[penis|dick]]</del> [[Cake|Delicious cake]] can fill.

[[Coprophilia|Richard Dawkins]] started using the Flying Spaghetti Monster as a serious argument, casting aside like so much old meat his old love, The Purple Unicorns Who Live on Jupiter, so now the [[Rational Response Squad|Rational Response Squid]] and every other random atheist group does as well. Theologians have since speculated that a sense of humor may be a God-given endowment, which would explain why others are [[nerd rage|interested]] with the [[fail|rational discussion]].

==The FSM is God==
What people don't know is that the FSM is <del>God</del> [[unfunny|really not that clever]].

The Flying Spaghetti Monster is to the Invisible Pink Unicorn as [[Chuck Norris]] facts are to [[Goatse|Vin Diesel]] facts. The moral of the story is that gays have AIDS.
