'''Tony '[[lie|Golden Balls]] [[George W. Bush|I'll-invade-anywhere-I-want]]' Blair''' (not to be confused with the Blair Witch) was once the Prime Minster of [[Britain]] and leader of the [[Lemonparty|'The Labour Party']] before [[Gordon Brown]] told him to GTFO.  Despite [[Whore|advertising himself]] to the British public as an approachable and friendly guy when running for the post of PM, he ended up being one of the most hated leaders in Europe. This was mainly due to him starting an illegal war with Bush against Iraq under the notion of "weapons of mass destruction", which apparently [[Srsly|he heard from a taxi driver about]]. Also, he's the Devil Incarnate.



== Early Life ==
Born the son of a cockney bootblack in late Victorian [[London]], Tony worked his way down the [[Cock|greasy pole]] before finally becoming a [[Lawyer]]. He languished in this self-imposed hell for many years, before [[Murder|succeeding]] some fat Scottish guy and landing the [[Balls|plumb]] job of 'striker', or [[Buttsecks|Quarterback]], for the newly-formed 'New Labor Sockpuppets' in July of 1994. <br>
Blair is also well known in the UK as a dancer and light entertainer and was a team captain in the charades based game show 'Give Us A Clue'. His signature dance move is known as 'The Big Lionel' when he stops tap dancing and preforms a [[Homosexual|theatrical]] turn, grins, claps his hands and continues tap dancing. Whilst preforming this move he shouts "big Lionel!" in order to draw more attention to himself. This move has since been used a number of times in his later career, in particular during the cash for honors investigation by the Metropolitan Police to distract and confuse the police while asking him tricky questions.

== Family Life ==
Blair is married to the [[Sarcasm|lovely]] [[Ann Coulter|Cherie]], with whom he has spawned three monstrous children. The eldest, Jormungandr, is a [[Otherkin|serpent]] of such immense size that even [[Goatse]] would wince. Fenris is a huge [[Furry|wolf]], while their only daughter Hela is half [[Necrophilia|corpse]], half [[Pedophilia|girl]]. All three regularly [http://www.guardian.co.uk/more_about/0,,340787,00.html run amok in British cities], [[Semen|cementing]] Blair's absolute grip on power. 

== Relations with America ==

Despite being a (nominal) socialist and former [[Hippy]] who often putted it to [[The Man]], Blair grew [[Gay|somewhat]] close to George Bush in the years he was Prime Minister. [[Some argue]] this is because they both share a love of [[God|Morgan Freeman]], while others claim they are brought together by a mutual hatred of Arab and the shared goal of wanting their oil. Blair was often greeted with cheers from American on-lookers whenever he visited for some bullshit reason that nobody can explain, but then again these particular people had probably never seen another Englishman other than Hugh Grant before.

== Hatred of Muslims ==
Blair, and the [[Lemonparty|Labour Party]] generally, is widely loved for his hatred of [[Arab|Sand Niggers]]. Not content with telling them how to dress, he has also single-handedly [[Pwned]] [http://www.iraqbodycount.net/ several thousand] of them in his time in office. Whether this hatred is merely a ploy to gain votes, or a sign of an underlying decency, is [[Shit nobody cares about|something we will never know]].

== Relations with God ==
Blair is a self confest believer of [[God|Morgan Freeman]] and the teachings of [[Raptor Jesus|Jesus Christ]], and after resigning from office became an offical [[Pedophile|Catholic]]. Blair's love of the Lord, unthough not completely uncommon for a Britfag, is still somewhat unusual considering that not only did he govern a country that is home to well known [[Charles Darwin|sceptics]], but there's also the fact that [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6818004/Just-half-of-Britons-now-call-themselves-Christian-after-a-sharp-decline-in-faith-over-past-25-years.html only around 50% of the population is still Christian], and [[Athiests]] will often [[Attention Whore|broadcast]] their views on [[Richard Dawkins|the sides of buses]] and television. However, being a country of [[Nobody Cares|indifference]] regarding belief, unlike America where it's essential, a Britfag's hate for the grinning shit more than likely stems from his fuck-ups in the Middle East rather than his hardon for Jesus.

== Leaving office ==
After some [[Rape|agreements]] with the current Prime Minster [[Gordon Brown]], Blair stood down after the elections of 2005, and the one-eyed scottish idiot took over. Tony Blair now makes loads of money off speaking at dinner parties and making people pay just to take a photgraph with him. He then became a UN ambassador for the Middle East. He's obviously doing a [[Lie|good fucking job there]], you know with all the [[Fail|peace and all]]. 

He also recently made an appearence for his old mate Gordon telling the country that he should be elected for another term. Tony then fucked off, probably after Gordon told him to in fear of even more hate being flung Gordon's way. However, regardless of Blair's actions Mrs Duffy had already claimed the title of "2010 Labour Re-election killer" with a "[[Racist|bigoted]]" statement.
