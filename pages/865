Basic accounts
[[Image:LJ-User.jpg|right|thumb|"[[AIDS|Ads]]? Not in my goddamn Livejournal!"]]'''Basic accounts''' are a form of account no longer offered by [[Livejournal]]. When this change in policy wasn't announced by [[Soviet Russia|SUP]] in a timely manner, the ensuing [[lulz]] took over [http://news.livejournal.com/106731.html the Livejournal news feed].

== Some History ==
[[At least 100 years ago]], Livejournal offered two kinds of accounts: [[Rich_and_beautiful|Paid]] and [[Poor|Free]]. After realizing how much money he could make on it, Livejournal creator [[Bradfitz|Brad]] [[Livejournal_Buyout|sold]] Livejournal to [[Six Apart]], much to the dismay and horror of users everywhere.

'''S'''ix '''A'''part's '''L'''ive'''J'''ournal (which many [[dramatician]]s saw as the long-awaited return of [[SALJ]]), started their long and notorious history of [[YHBT|infuriating]] Livejournal's userbase by offering a new type of account: '''Plus'''. Free accounts became '''[[retarded|Basic]]''' and Paid accounts remained the same. Plus accounts offered more [[icon|features]], but shat all over a user's journal with [[advertising|ads]].

In the time since, [[basement dwellers]] everywhere have been [[masturbation|beating drums]] to the song of oppression and cruelty practiced by SixApart's policies, including [[The Great LJ Outage Of 2006]] and [[The Great Livejournal Strikethrough of 2007]].

== What Happened ==
After a long, embittered battle with their own users, the Livejournal staff soon realized that they were running out of money for [[hookers and blow]]. They needed to think of a new way to pull in some cash, quick. It wasn't long before they thought of a solution.

In early 2008, a new post announced [[shit nobody cares about|the 100-day anniversary]] of SUP's ownership of Livejournal, including a tiny mention about a [[VTEC Just Kicked In Yo|streamlined]] account creation process.


{{quote|Other changes you may have noticed are the logged-out homepage and registration process for new users. We streamlined and simplified things so that now itâ€™s faster and easier than ever to create a [[sock journal|LiveJournal account]].|theljstaff, [http://news.livejournal.com/106731.html painfully unaware that users would soon catch on]}}

Soon after realizing that [[you fail it|they had, in fact, been had]], many users started commenting demanding explanations. Comments included [[some argue|speculation]] that SUP may or may not be the Russians who own LJ, others demanded a [[I did it for the lulz|full explanation]]. When one was offered by the [[Government|VP of Product Development]], he was flamed by the hordes of [[butthurt]] [[tinfoil hat]]s screaming for the Livejournal staff's blood. Once again showing that the staff have no understanding of the [[internets]], he [[crybaby|complained]] about personal attacks after the second or so response to his comment.


{{quote|I think the personal attacks are a bit much, I'm happy to comment here as long as this is a reasonable conversation.|jasonshellan, completely unaware of the nature of the internet}}

24 hours later, the Livejournal staff suffered [[Troll's remorse]] and made another news post trying to clarify the new changes in policy. Swearing that they didn't want to "undermine the culture of LiveJournal" (as though Livejournal somehow has a culture beyond bacteria), they promptly tried to [http://news.livejournal.com/106909.html explain] their new position.

Shortly after the whole clusterfuck of [[Insane|crazy]] exploded, Russian news site CNews [http://eng.cnews.ru/news/top/indexEn.shtml?2008/03/13/291948 covered the affair], going so far as to ask SUP's head of blog department Anton Nosik about [[I did it for the lulz|why he made the changes]]. He replied with his deeply insightful understanding of [[unlimited disposable income|the blog market]], while tipping his hand about [[spyware|LJ's future policy]].

[[Some argue|Some speculate]] that in the future, the [[friends only]] option will require an additional fee per post.

== [[The Great Livejournal Content Strike of 2008|Content Strike 2008]] ==
[[Image:Content-strike.jpg|right|thumb|BAAAAWWWWWWW.]]Feeling as though somehow [[Unwarranted self-importance|they're going to make a difference]], Livejournal's many [[fandom]]s declared a one-day [[flounce|content strike]], stating that for a single day they won't post any entries or comments to Livejournal. While everyone else wishes they would [[Deleting your LiveJournal|make this permanent]], the outlook on actual change is grim.
