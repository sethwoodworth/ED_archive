==Bookchan on /b/==

As off 6/23/2009 a young /b/ entrepreneur left an innocuous "i'll just leave this here" picture of two delicious breasts. It quickly spiraled out of control when [[Faggot|one member asked for higher res "to see titles of books" in the background]]. Upon picture of books, Bookchan was born. She included many more pics of her with books, choosing to hide her face behind books that /b/ generally agreed were "good". Bookchan was very responsive, and in a rare moment for /b/, universally loved.

[http://www.anonib.com/bookchan/ Bookchan] Is an [[AnonIB]] subboard catering to the semi-literate [[/b/|/b/tards]] who go apeshit whenever they see an ebook thread.  Inside, you will find a level of geekery so profound that your eyes will ''actually eject'' themselves from your skull in a desperate attempt to keep the name of JRR Tolkien from burning into your retinas.

Bookchan is proof that at least a dozen [[/b/]]tards are literate. Any more than that becomes a dodgy assumption.

The joke is on them, however.  Ebooks are a [[Jewish]], [[old media]] conspiracy designed to turn the [[internet]] into yet another library.
