'''David Thorne''' aka '''Tabitha Gnillort''' is an [[Ausfag]] 'writer'/'comedian'/[[attention whore]]/cross-dresser and [[spider enthusiast]] from Adelaide better known for his [[1337]] trollage of [[Facebook]], [[twitter]] and other social networks. He is the author of [http://www.fontainepress.com/davidthorne/index.html ''The Internet Is A Playground''], a collection of 'Tabitha's' trolling tales taken from his site. He is also semi-[[Internets famous]] for his [[Bill Spider]] troll.

However, any cred and props that are due Mr Thorne are completely shot to shit because he claims that he is a devotee of and is inspired by the faggot known as [[Maddox]].

Regardless, Mr Thorne still has game and in late April [[2010]], he started a [[meme]] of epic proportions when he invited the entire world to [[Kate's Party]] on his twitter feed.


==Kate's Party==
''See main article at: [[Kate's Party]]''

On April 21st, Mr. Thorne found a Facebook event for a small local birthday celebration set up by a naive young Adelaide [[cumdumpster]] by the name of Kate. Unfortunately, young Kate fails at Internets  and privacy settings and left the event '''open''' to [[anon|all-comers]]. When Mr Thorne happened across the event, he decided to [[troll|throw a little dick into the party]] by announcing it on his 30,000 followers of his twitter feed:

{{quote|Yay. Kate's having a party in her small apartment. Hit attending & give the host an aneurysm: http://tinyurl.com/29hrgfa|27bslash6}}

The rest is history as this [[tweet]] became a shot heard round the Internets, going [[viral]] and finally landed on [[b|/b/]]. [[ebaums]] quickly set about RSVPing to Kate's party [[9000|en masse]] and spamming up the comments with the usual litany of fucktardery and lulz. They also started sending poor [[noob|unsuspecting]] Kate hundreds of messages with all manner of vile and debauched invitations to their own [[buttsecks|private parties]] and started the search for [[dox]].

==Trolls Trolling Trolls Trolling Trolls==

Not satisfied to let this epic, subtle [[OTI]] to [[IRL]] troll and its attendant [[lollercaust]] become a natural born viral meme, Mr Thorne later decided to [[trying too hard|insert himself further]] into the budding Internets [[drama|brouhaha]] to [[forced meme|force it]] and [[usi|stamp his name on it]]. Already famous for pretending to be [[loli]] on the Internets, he then set up a [[sock]] Kate Miller account and plant another open event for Kate's Party after the OG Kate had pulled the plug on the original event. 

This event is set for May 8th rather than the original event which was set for May 1st and already has another 50,000 plus aspiring party animals. It remains to be seen how Mr Thorne will milk this for maximum drama and lulz but since this meme is already getting [[old meme|old]], it's unlikely that [[nobody cares|anyone will care]] by then.

===David Visits ED===
[[File:Kateisfakee.jpg|thumb|left|David Thorne [[nice try|attempting]] to troll ED's trolls]]
To further his agenda, Mr Thorne paid a visit to [[ED]] on the night of April 25th to try [[divide by zero|trolling the trolls who are already trolling trolls that troll trolls]]. As is his usual [[tranny|bent]] Mr Thorne created an account [[Special:Contributions/Cristina|posing as a girl]] to post a [[shoop]] of an alleged twitter post from '''27bslash6''' claiming that he was, in fact, the original Kate and that even the initial Kate's Party event was of his design and that he had trolled everyone -even ED. He/she then [[get on IRC|got on ED IRC]] claiming that the original tweet had been deleted so there was no actual proof that this wasn't [[this looks shopped|a shoop]].

However, as we all know, [[YHBT|you can't troll a troll]] and ED's crack [[LNN|Lulz News Network]] team of investigative journalists [[calling bullshit|called bullshit]], having already contacted the 'real' Kate Miller and gotten her take on the hueg  [[internet phenomena]] that her party had become. This after due diligence was done and having verified her as '''''not''''' being David Thorne. 

{{quote|And what would you like to say to David Thorne?|ED}}
 
{{quote|Grow up. Get a real job.|Kate}}


It is unknown how this [[pwn]]age affected Mr Thorne, but by the next day, his fake Kate Miller profile and the May 8th [[Kate's Party]] had vanished from the face of Facebook.
