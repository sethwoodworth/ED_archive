[[Image:Tricky balloon.gif|thumb|He does normal clown stuff occasionally]] '''Tricky the Clown''' was one of [[Newgrounds]]' first [[memes]] and harkens back to a time when it was a place of tomfoolery and silliness, like the rest of [[Web 1.0]]. 

== History ==

[[Shit nobody cares about|No-one cares]] who invented Tricky; it's likely that [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/75345 this] [[baleeted|blammed]] movie was first . However, [[E-Penis|famous]]  [[not racist|NGer]] [[shortcat|dwarf]] 'DanPaladin' (aka Synj) is widely credited with popularising the meme with his [[semen|seminal]] piece [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/75657 'xkittyfroggymeowmeow']. It existed to punish the [[epilepsy|epileptics]] who had managed to survive all the other crappy [[Dragonball Z]] [[Plagiarism|ripoffs]] other [[moron|people]] had submitted. The image soon managed to end up burned into the retinas of all who viewed it; there were periods where it was hard to escape. People would have nightmares, full of flashing lights and circus music, in which they got [[raped]], painfully, [[not funny|by a clown]]. 

And Tricky became a mascot for the rest of the [[sick fuck|confused]] children who dared to tread across the wasteland of the NG portal.

Sry dude, but i gotta blam this piece of flying monkey crap. Honestly u have put urself to shame....|Sir-Kaliback|Here I thought this might actually be AH2 but instead there's a clown with an overactive penis. Are you fucking 12 Synj? If a clown with a boner turns you on then go download some gay porn off of Kazza & prepare for a barrel of laughs.I'm sorry but this isn't even a good/funny joke. It's just extremely fucking stupid. This should of been blammed the second it entered the portal but only lived on due to your name being on it. Next time you think about putting a clown with a boner in your movie (possible childhood trauma?) due something much more healthier for yourself like sticking a fork in a toaster perhaps?|Syrynged}}</center>

[[Image:Tricky mashed potatoes.gif|thumb|He can dance!]] The movie [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/87023 [[Weeaboo|^_^!DANCYNIP!^_^]]] set up Tricky's modus operandi: entering unannounced to circus music, waving his [[cock|penis]] about, and then leaving the screen, allowing the storyline to continue. This was followed by the [[Clock Crew]] movie '[http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/75688 N]' perhaps the most important movie of all the Tricky movies and the one others aspired to be like. Tricky was very much the [[screamer]] of his day, although instead of the viewer being affronted by [[pussy|scary pictures]] and [[Youtube Poop|loud noises]], they were treated to rather jovial music, a seizure-inducing background, and a famous clown with his penis out. Newgrounds should be ashamed [[SARS|how well it caught on]].

== The Present ==

[[Image:TrickyNewgroundsTank.gif|thumb|Stand aside!]] Tricky later became a character in the [http://madnesscombat.com/ Madness Combat] series. This [[old meme|killed it]]. He started off [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/121940 acting similarly], but the present day Tricky [[arse|bares little resemblance]] to its initial premise. Many NG [[noobs]] are currently unaware of Tricky in its earliest conception and some of them haven't even seen Madness Combat.

The concept of jovial abuse to the viewer is as strong as ever at Jewgrounds, with a constant barrage of spam groups attempting to [[forced meme|create something as iconic as Tricky]]. So far, all have [[loser|failed]].
