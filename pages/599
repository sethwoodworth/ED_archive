Areems
{{crapstub}}

Areems is the IRC handle of known [[fat]]ty Armands Leimanis, a 16 year old [[Latvia]]n transvestite with a poor grasp of English and a strong grasp of [[User:Pi|Pi]]. 

Areems is the cause of the Latvian IP block (A class-B for a whole country? how lame!) 159.148.0.0/16 being G-lined permanently on [[Buttes|buttesnet]] chat.
