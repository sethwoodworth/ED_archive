Neon Stripes
{{crapstub}}

As we all know, if there is one thing a [[furry]] is good at, it's screaming and whining at anyone who doesn't immediately bow down and kiss their ass over their shitty [[furry art|artwork]] and their love of the canine [[penis|phallus]]. This is a never-ending source of [[lulz]] and while great, it's started to clog up the tubes. In come the Stripes. These guys range anywhere, from [[/b/|/b/tards]] to furries to people who just love the [[lulz]] that seem to follow the Stripes like a sick puppy.

== The Main Goal of Neon Stripes ==

Now, the Neon Stripes will SAY that they're only looking out for what's best in the fandom by ousting those who are in it simply for the porn, and furs who whine and moan incessantly about [[retarded]] [[crap]]. In reality, however, it's nothing more than a [[lie|fa√ßade]] to hide their real intent; making the lives of other furs miserable.

Why would furries make other furries' lives miserable, you ask? The answer is simple- [[lulz]]! Mountains and mountains of it! Yes, the [[lulz]] is justification for any act of trolling, and where [[lulz]] can be found, trolls are almost always there. That's just how things work. 

== Home of the Stripes ==

By this point, you may begin to question the [[facts]] described in this article. If the Stripes are responsible for so many trolling feats, why has no one ever heard of them? The Internets are a vast and lonesome place, and if the correct measures are taken then [[God]] knows you can hide anything. The Stripes do this well since no one (not even the editor of this article) has a damned clue where they come from. They just pop up out of nowhere, strike, then vanish. LJ accounts are created, used, and then deleted. deviantARTlets are spammed and trolled and when the time comes for retaliation- the account is gone! [[Serious]] business, people.

== Random Other Shit ==

Only three of these furs have been properly identified. We know them as Leon, Zeal, and Almost.
There are no record of their [[lulz]] anywhere. You have to be there to see it.
When a whiny little [[shit]] can't get retribution on their attackers, they flail about and viola! More [[lulz]]!
