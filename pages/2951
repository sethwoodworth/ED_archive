'''Find a Grave''' is a website dedicated to documenting [[dead]] people and their graves. It was founded in [[old|1995]], and [[Web 1.0|it shows]]. This website would've been unremarkable except for the fact that [[Wikipedia|anyone can create an account and create an entry]]. As long as you know a person's [[dox]], you can create an entry for your favorite [[an hero]]. Even if you don't have dox, you can still create minor lulz. You can write messages called "Flowers" for the entry. Flowers include a image and some text. This could allow anyone to [[troll]] [[lolcow]]s even after their death. Nevertheless, one ought to be careful, since flowers can be disabled and removed.
