'''Anecdotal evidence''' is the favored form of supportive evidence used by [[girl]]s, [[trolls]], and [[crybaby|crybabies]].

The weight attributed to this evidence is directly proportional to the length of the poster's stories about the topic at hand.  Many [[flame wars]] start and end under the crushing weight and length of some people's "evidence" that [[liberals]] are all egotists (see [[Belt0033]]).

Anecdotal evidence usually begins with a [[dubious disclaimer]], followed by [[IRL]] stories about the poster's [[IRL]] experience with actual [[black]] people, [[liberals]], [[conservatives]] or [[homosexual]]s.  [[Irony|Ironically]], anecdotal evidence does not stand up to [[IRL]] very well, no matter how vehemently the poster asserts his/her experience [[IRL]]!!!!

Experienced [[e-lawyers]] do not need to rely on anecdotal evidence.

==Anecdotal Withdrawal==
Any inconsistencies, examples-to-the-contrary and outright falsehoods are usually met with Anecdotal Withdrawal: statements looking something like, "Well, I guess the homos where you live are different from where I live, I was only talking specifically about those homos with whom I've interacted [[IRL]]".

==How We Know Anecdotal Evidence Is Insufficient==

Cos I once knew this guy who relied on it and liek he <s>lost</s> accidentally the whole case!!!
