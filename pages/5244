Max Gogarty [[spongebob|lives on top of a hill in North London.]] In between wearing [[Skinny Jeans]] and shitting himself, he gets paid by national newspapers to write utter fucking tripe because his dad’s bigger than [[you|yours]].

==Shitting Himself==

It was an unassuming February morning in 2008 when Max Gogarty strolled onto [[The Guardian]] webpage and announced that he was [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/travelog/2008/02/skins_blog.html going to shit himself.]

Max, a middle-class, spoilt fucker from [[Londonistan]] was off to travel Asia for a while. If by “Asia” we mean India and fucking Thailand and if for a while, we mean two whole months. Like any spoilt cunt of a teenager, he wanted to write a blog about it. Unlike any spoilt cunt of a teenager, he somehow landed a blog in an [[IRL]] British newspaper to tell us about his emo adventures taking a crap and fighting off snakes in the middle of a city. 

What poor Max didn’t realise was that comments were turned on. Within hours, [[over 9000]] well-meaning [[trolls|users]] of The Guardian’s Comment is Free board had scrambled to the board to register that they were [[facepalm|slightly disappointed]] in the low quality of the article:

{{quote|how marvellous i think im going to barf with excitement.| – johnnynashjr, last Thursday}}

{{quote|He looks like a cliche, talks like a cliche, and is about to embark on a monumental cliche.
This is a spoof, isn't it?|– No, Lameplanet. It’s not!}}

Unfortunately for Max and the snakes, [[Anonymous]] was present on the board that day and quickly realised that he was the son of a fucking travel writer for the same paper. So began the scouring of Max Gogarty and his shitty arse:

{{quote| “"Max: I'm doing India on my own."
You goddamn heroic bastard. How exactly are you planning on "doing" a billion people?|- Cygnus}}

{{quote|You all should be ashamed. Max hasn’t stopped shitting himself all morning|- Maxmum}}

{{quote|Still maybe we'll get a blog entry about Max waking up after a night in a Thai bar to discover that his kidneys are missing...|- Scorf}}

==Daddy Comes to the Rescue==

[[Image:tsunami_of_hate.jpg|thumb|The tsunami of hate, seeking Max.]]


Thankfully, the paper took the most logical response to dispel rumours of nepotism. They called in Max's fucking father to shout at everyone. No, [[rly]]. He [http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/feb/17/internet?gusrc=rss&feed=technology (Username: Er, MaxDad)] showed up to defend his son, begging the [[trolls|good people]] of Comment is Free to [[Chris Crocker|leave Max alone]]: "'Max won't be writing any more blogs, I thought I'd bring all those heroic internet warriors the good news. Max's trip (which he [[lie|paid for himself]] I'm afraid - sorry) has got off to the worst possible start and he's feeling pretty grim You may like or dislike the blog, but the cruelty is shocking, if quintessentially British." [[Lulz]].

{{quote|The exposure is terrifying,' said Gogarty Snr. 'He's out in India on his own. We were all feeling upset at him going away anyway. But this...this [[anonymous|tsunami of hate]]. We just cannot believe it. He is not an attention seeker. He is just bright and 19 and middle-class - and that's a [[lolwut|crime in Britain]].'|}}



==Wikinazis==

The People turned to Wikipedia to inform them of the terrible injustice going on at Gogarty Headquarters, for the Jews there would uphold democracy, amirite? 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nepotism#Max_Gogarty IAMWRONG.]

[[Some argue]] that the Gogartys petitioned Wikipedia to take down the offending page about Max because it would destroy his [[n00b|burgeoning career]]. ED has taken up the challenge to record Max’s adventures shitting himself in order to provide him with a back-up [[job|career]]. 

==The Future - Moar Incontinence==

Max has two options: to take the noble route and become [[an hero]] or alternatively to keep using daddy’s influence to write mind-numbingly shit articles for a tidy sum. Either option will yield a fair amount of dysentery. 

Or maybe, as The Guardian likes to make use of its own people, they will take the advice of one of the Comment is Free trolls: 

{{quote|In the same way that children who are caught smoking are made to smoke a whole packet to teach them a lesson, the Guardian should be made to go through with this, in the hope that it learns its own lesson. I suggest that the Guardian be required to publish: 
1) a daily blog by Max, for the rest of his natural life

2) daily blogs by all his children thereafter

3) annual compilations (in hardback) of the best of Max’s entries, together with the best of the comments, in time for the Christmas market.|}}

There will be [[MOAR]] on this article when Max returns from India all shat out from his fights with snakes and [[nigras]].
