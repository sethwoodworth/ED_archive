Alex Jones
{{WP80navsmall}}
[[Image:Joker_Jones.jpg|thumb|Why so [[insane|batshit]]?]]
Alex Jones, also known as the fatter [[David Icke]], and the antimatter to [[Rush Limbaugh]], is a "paleoconservative" (read: paranoid conspiracy theorist) and [[oxymoron|libertarian intellectual]] from [[Texas]] (well that explains it) who believes that the [[United States]] is being run by the [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy]].  He can prove all his theories are true; he merely chooses not to.

"If you don't believe 9/11 was an inside job, it is because you consumed fluoride." OR "If you disagree with me, it is merely because you have consumed fluoride. Everybody that disagrees with me is a brainwashed sheeple." -These few quotes are commonly used by Alex Jones and his FOLLOWERS and exemplify the sublime [[logic]] and points of argumentation they implement. 

== Documentaries ==

[[Image:Alex_Jones_cartman_and_otters.jpg|thumb|Alex Jones being taken captive by FEMA]] 
The most notable portion of Jones' longstanding career is the absurd number of documentaries he's made over the years exposing the lies of the [[The Man|government]]. The first big epic title in these [[lie|expos√©s]] was <i>America: Wake Up or [[Waco]]</i>, about the [[FBI]] raid on the [[cult|Branch Davidians]] in 1993.

Average plot summary of an Alex Jones documentary:
* The Branch Davidians were not a cult but a [[Hippy|peace-loving]] religious group. And David Koresh was in [[lie|no way a pedophile]].
* The government is being run by the [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy]], who are in turn run by [[Satanist]]s.
* The Masonic Conspiracy funds [[war]]s through [[jew gold|centralized banks]].
* [[Jews did WTC|Israeli intelligence connection to 9/11]] {{youtube|C7hIQ8UM9Y0|(UNDENIABLE PROOF)}}
* The government is creating a North American Union http://www.spp.gov/ as a cover to poison the world population with nano-technology and en[[slave]] the [[human]] race. ([[Seriously]]. Don't believe it? Try [http://www.endgamethemovie.com/ this on for size].)

All of these documentaries are on sale on one of Jones' various websites. All of them cost a small
fortune for the DVD versions, but since people rip them and put them on Google video no one buys them anyway.

==Radio Show==
[[Image:Jonestard.gif|thumb|Alex Jones gives us an idea of what debating on his radio show is like.]]
Like every [[oxymoron|conservative intellectual]] with a computer, Jones is also [[e-fame|famous ]] for having his own [[radio]] show. Most of the time it tends to be a [[circle-jerk]] of [[conspiracy]] theorists and people who call in only to get [[pwnt]] by Jones' [[fanboy]]s.

[[Shit nobody cares about|Other popular topics]] include:
* Celebrity interviews, like [[Shit nobody cares about|that guy who claims to have fucked an alien]] and the editor of the World Weekly News
* Jones getting [[Loose Change]] made into a Hollywood production
* The [[Jews|true faces]] of the New World Order
* The [[Homosexuality|Elite Agenda]]
* [[Barack Obama]] is the anti-christ.

[[Some argue]] that the Muse song "Time is Running Out" is about the [[blowjob]] Jones gave [[gay|Matthew Bellamy]] to get him to appear on the show.

==The Internet==

[[Image:Showmedavidsbuttfuck.gif|thumb|Typical Alex Jones fans.]] 
Jones runs [[over 9000|a number]] of websites devoted to his war against the [[Jews|elite]], the most notable of which are Prison Planet and Infowars. Both sites appeal to [[basement dwellers|freethinkers]] of the [[tinfoil hat|eclectic]] variety. Though [[conservatives|conservatards]] love to cite Jones as a champion of truth and freedom in the wake of [[W|George Bush]]'s rampant [[faggotry]], any [[moron]] who actually bothers to read his articles would know that [[YHBT|he's just as bad, if not worse]] than the people he so heroically stands against, because he's actually a [[fail|conservative]]. He's supposedly what's called a "paleoconservative", which is supposed to be the opposite of a [[Neocon|neoconservative]]. This makes Jones roughly the political equivalent of a [[Jerry Falwell|televangelist]].

Selling points of an Alex Jones website include:
* Articles about the dangers of [[government]]
* Ads for [[science fiction|critical survivalist literature]] written by [[sockpuppet|ardent Jones supporters]]
* Colloidal silver ([[Wikipedia:Argyria|Argyria ftw!]])
* Trailers for Jones' [[Star Wars|next documentary]]
* Flash ads for the above that eat up your computer's memory until it [[HNNNNNNGGGGG|dies]].
* News about the amero AKA crazy tokens that do not exist

==Dr. Death, 2006==
[[Image:EricPianka.jpg|thumb|This man wants to kill everyone in your family using [[AIDS]].]]
The drama began when a well-known [[science|scientist]], Dr. Pianka, gave a lecture at the [[oxymoron|Texas Academy of Science]] and made some [[troll|off-hand remarks]] about how humans were destroying the planet and how likely it is a [[lollercaust|pandemic]] will [[ban fucking everyone|wipe out a large portion of the population]] in the future. Investigative journalist and general [[fucktard]] Forrest Mims decided that these were the words of a mad scientist bent on wiping out the human population with an airborne virus, and Jones quickly caught on, calling Pianka "Dr. Death", the frontman for the [[Jews|elite's]] New World Order agenda of [[holocaust|genocide]].

In the time since, Dr. Pianka's received a number of death threats from various [[internet tough guy|crusaders for justice]].

==The NWO Illuminati 666==

For every action, there is a reaction. That is the way the world works. For every fat, loathsome [[Penn_and_Teller|Libertarian]] lurking in his trailer-park "fallout shelter," rabidly ordering "survival seeds" from Jones' sponsors, there is an equally fat, [[Hipsters|community-college grad fag]] "ironically" listening to the radio show, [[tubgirl|incredulously gushing]] in pained exasperation at every single one of Alex's insane assertions. 

As such, the only people who actually care enough to vocally and publicly oppose the bellicose Fuck, are knee-jerk [[Keith_olbermann|Olbermann]] [[liberals|fans]]: the same people who thought it "progressive" to elect a nigger president, put a Jew in charge of the banks - and who are more than likely responsible for this very article.

Alex Jones is the definition of [[shit nobody cares about]], and neither should you.

== [[YHBT|Critical Questions for the Alex Jones Fan]] ==
* If Alex Jones' documentaries and books are full of the vital critical information needed to stop the New World Order, why does he still charge money for them? (Note: all can be found for free on youtube, posted by Jones himself.)
* How can a [[Furluminati|world-controlling organization]] be stopped by the very system of government it invented? ...oh wait. It <b>CAN'T.</b>(Note: [[Schizophrenic|They didn't invent it, they simply infiltrated it.]])
* If Alex Jones and [[Loose Change|Dylan Avery]] are all that stands between the government and world domination, why haven't they been killed by CIA hitmen yet?(Note: [[Insane|That would be calling their bluff, and make them more credible.]])
* If fire can't melt steel, then why did [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18380884 this] happen? 
* If heat can't make metal weaker, then why do blacksmiths put shit into fire before hitting it with a hammer? 
* Also, isn't steel ''made'' by melting stuff?
* See if they can define [[Neocon|Paleocon]] in their own words without using anything they learned from Alex Jones or [[Wikipedia]], or see if they can use it in an accurate and non-sensationalistic manner.
* Ask them if they can explain why Jones stated the firefighters were involved in [[9/11]] on his radio show and web site, but when he was questioned about it later he denied he ever said anything like that[http://wtc7lies.googlepages.com/alexjonesvilifiesthefdnyandlarrysilverst].
* Ask them why [[Sellout|Alex Jones]] sucks off [[Scam|homeopathy]] faggots [http://rosemaryjacobs.com/rose1.html hocking colloidal silver], if he cares so much for his [[Money|country]]?
* If Bohemian Grove is a [[homosexual]] hang-out what was Alex Jones [[blowjob|doing]] [[rimjob|there]] in the first place?
* How much did you weigh before you got into conspiracy theories?
* Why does [http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_14?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=the+illuminati&sprefix=the+illuminati everyone] seem to know everything about these "secret" societies?

* Would Alex Jones push me?

==Parking Lot Story==

A source of lulz for the last three years, the '''Alex Jones' Parking Lot Story''' is infamous amongst Jones' cult followers, independent free-press, and Alex's detractors, alike. 

While the reality of the story is up for debate, it is not unreasonable to assume that Alex - [[Singing_Shark|a loudmouth fuck who picks fights with relative strangers]] - started the fight, and then lost it, accordingly. (An example of his reasoning skills can be heard daily on his radio program, [[ad_hominem|where he debates]] with callers who disagree.)

The story goes: Alex and company, including his father, Bob, were having dinner at some restaurant. At another table was a RL troll named [[trollface|Steve]]. Alex recognized the man's voice (as Steve routinely called various radio shows in the Austin area to prank them; favouring Alex's show.) Approaching the man, Alex began to curse at and threaten Steve. Alex, acting big, stated he was going to whip the troll's ass. Steve stepped up and double dawg dared him to step outside...

At first, Alex wavered. But, having a huge ego and a tough guy image to keep up, (and realizing that even if he lost the fight, he could always lie later-on,) Alex went outside to confront Steve.

In the parking lot, Alex was hesitant to fight, but Steve kept at him. 
In true nigger fashion, Alex threatened to pull his piece on Steve, who RL trolled Alex even more by calling him a "pussy;" stating, to the extent, that "only pussies bring a gun to a fist-fight, you jarhead pussy." 

Alex, according to eye-witness reports, ran to his truck, fumbling for his gun, which he apparently slipped into some pocket. Then, with a hand in that pocket, advanced on Steve - who, after a few steps backwards, triple-dawg dared Alex to, "shoot me already, you jarhead bitch." Then popped Alex in the face, dropping him like a faggot.

Alex cried for dad, ordering one of his dinner guests to, "[[forced_meme|Get Bob!!]]" 

While Alex's cohort ran indoors to fetch daddy, Alex got back up and [[pretty_cool_guy|spat blood in Steve's face]]. Steve reacted accordingly, and punched Alex again, dropping him.

[[tldr|Long story short]]: Before fleeing the restaurant parking lot, Alex told Steve that he had [[facepalm|powerful relatives in the FBI]], and reported to them Steve's [now defunct] bookstore as a terrorist front, and [[brad_dayley|Steve, as a pedo, with large cache of CP]]
. 
The fed, in true Illuminati fashion, found Steve not guilty of anything.

Alex, remembering his revelation at dinner the night before, went on-air and claimed that he was jumped by 4-5 knife-wielding assailants (despite not receiving even one cut during his heroic struggle.) They hated freedom, loved to oppresses patriots, and wanted him dead. But, Alex told, he valiantly fought them off with only his bare fists, because he wasn't going to lay down - he wasn't afraid!

To this day, Alex fights to have this story [[Final_solution|removed from the Internets forever]].

==Ways to troll Alex Jones fans==

- Inform them that it was actually the Jews who were behind 9/11

- Tell them Alex Jones is a false flag conspiracy theorists working for the Jews ([[Facepalm|some people actually believe this]])

- Tell them the The Rothchilds are not the reason for their virginity
