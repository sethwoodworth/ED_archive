'''TwilightSucks''', also known as '''TS''', '''/ts/''', or '''/TS/''' is [[Mars Defden|Mars Defden's]] indelible stain on the Internet painted with her menstrual fluids after [[Ragequit|realizing how stupid the Twilight series is after she liked it for 0.25 seconds]]. [[Mars Defden]] claims that the site is for [[Bash|critique of the Twilight series,]] but is truly a Twilight-themed, failed imitation of [[4chan]] filled with [[16-year-old girls]] that are [[newfags]], [[moralfags]], [[Neopets|Neopets users]], [[Gaiafag|Gaiafags]], [[Harry Potter|Potterfags]], and [[Religion|mythologytards]] that had their sanity sapped away by [[Twilight|Stephenie Meyer]]. Strangely, they do the same things as the [[Twitard|Twitards]] they bash, but claim their purpose is higher just because the name of the book and fandom they are bashing is [[Twilight]]. [[Asspat|The staff are the gods from the sky, so there's no use in disagreeing with them.]] There is no need to blame them as the [[X is not your personal army|Mars' personal army]] because they do it out of their own will like vicious [[Dinosaur|velocioraptors]]. Only the trolls and one sane moderator are right about their behavior.
==[[Lie|We Don't Bash!]]==
Only one update on the main site page and two FAQ questions from the main site need to be shown here to summarize their hypocrisy.
{{quote|The Twilight Backlash Has Finally Begun and Officially Hit The Mainstream!

We never thought we'd see the day when the Anti-Twilight community would be able to indulge in some '''much needed mainstream bashing towards the entire Twilight franchise and its rabid fandom.''' [[Serious business|But for those Antis who have been paying attention we've gotten a few bits of victory popping up all over--from Twilight parody videos that continue to flood YouTube's most watched list, popular television shows like Supernatural and Vampire Diaries who bash Twilight in one way or another, and now we're finally seeing movie critics, book critics, and even actual publishing companies who acknowledge the SUCK of Twilight, embrace it, and do everything they can to speak out against the fail!]]|TwilightSucks.com}}

[[Faulty Logic|So it is okay support bashing when YOU aren't doing it?]]
 
 Q: Are You Harassing The Fans?
 
 A: [[Lie|No. And no our goal nor purpose is to upset the fans, at least not intentionally.]] [[Twitard#Twitard_Communities|We do NOT go out of our way to make little fangirls cry or   wet their pants.]] [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1680 We do not support or promote trolling the fans; we keep everything on our own turf.] (However you may see Antis voicing their opinions elsewhere such as Myspace, YouTube, or Twitter. These sites are open to EVERYONE; the fans do NOT own those networks so stop bitching about it!)   
 
 [[Wrong|You will never EVER see one of our members purposely seeking out fans on their own domain in hopes of provoking a verbal battle of insults. Trolling fansites is a highly bannable offense which we do not take lightly.]]

[[Ironic]] [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|since they believe what should]][[Anti-lulz| constitute lulzly material on ED by their standards, which only consists of trolls and Suethors.]] That's right, they support [[sick fucks.]]

{{quote|Q: You Should Shut Down Your Site! DO IT NOW!

A: 7,500+ unique daily visitors, 80,000+ daily impressions, and 4,700+ registered members would clearly disagree with you. As long as they keep coming, that's how long we'll still be up and running--stronger than ever before! You won't be snuffing us out anytime soon. Sorry to burst your bubble cupcake! DX|There are only about 200 members on the site at maximum. That's VERY active all right.}}

Clearly none of the members know the [http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/online_hate/deconst_online_hate.cfm what a hate site is] since [http://twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=13749 someone actually had to ask how to convince someone that TwilightSucks isn't a hate site.] Keep in mind that the linked topic was [[Denial|graveyarded.]]

==Rules==
We have properly translated the rules to reflect the true nature of the site. And yes, we know the translation contradicts itself in so many ways.
<span class="co;[Collapse];[Expand];0;test1"></span>
<div class="test1">
 Since we have rules for the chat posted, and people confuse the standard ToS that comes with every installment of phpBB. What you very likely skipped over when registering for the forum is not the list of rules that we expect our members to never follow.
 
 All "rules" can be modified to whatever the fuck we want.
 
 Instead, here is the rules for the forum that we never uphold. More will be removed in the future if staff members can think of anything that wasn't covered, but these are the only rules of the forum as we have always followed. Up until now, having them be unwritten and implied has worked, but apparently we've got some kids on this site who understand the concept of freedom of speech and open discussion.
 
 So, here we go.
 
 Rule #1: Discussion of anything and everything is discouraged, especially if it involves praising the Mars Defden article. No elaboration needed, as it's quite obvious.
 
 Rule #2: A discussion cannot take place if the opposing sides of a topic are considered. If you can't stand talking to people you don't agree with, participate in discussions. Again, this should be obvious.
 
 Rule #3: This site demotes freedom of speech. Pro-TwilightSucks opinions are accepted, but be ready to attack the other person in the discussion. We have no word filter in place, although we could use one. This means that no words are prohibited. If someone's using a word that you find to be offensive, ask them to stop or even discuss with them why it offends you. If they're immature enough, they won't take your words into consideration and use the word around you. Who knows? You will never change their mind and they'll continue using the word altogether. If you are mature enough to even ask them to stop, then Twilightsucks is not for you.
 
 Rule #4: There are various types of trolls. The ones we ban are [[Lulz|funny]] trolls that '''attack the site and/or its members directly (so it is perfectly acceptable if you all attack one person or speak it in unnecessarily long language).''' When someone says something that offends you. it means they were attacking you. Pointing out that what you said was wrong and/or not thought out well is attacking. How does this interact with Rule #3? Quite simple. It doesn't.
 
 Rule #5: Staff members are, in fact, considered gods of the site. If you say something specifically against one that's intended to offend, you've no one to blame but the victim if the banhammer falls on you. If you have a problem with a staff member, take it up with another staff member. Whether you believe it or not, we are all the same person, we do not have different points of view, and we always agree on things.
 
 In addition, if a staff member does determine that you are an [[Lulz|funny]] troll and should be banned, you are more than welcome to ask another staff member to look into the situation. Provided, of course, that you actually weren't an [[Lulz|funny]] troll. Because we have the same backgrounds, what one deems to be banhammer-worthy might not be such to another. If you do request a reconsideration, it will be discussed amongst the staff as a whole.
 
 Rule #6: There has been some questioning as to what the rules are regarding the posting of images. Basic rule of thumb is that if it's not safe for work, don't embed it, just link and provide a description. The exception to this rule is in the Artist's Venue, where people can seek critique of their art. The rule there is that if it's not safe for work, you say so in the subject of the topic.
 
 Just a note- If a post or a topic violates #4 or #6, never use the report button. Even though we try our lamest, we can be in every thread at once. Reporting a post is the slowest way to call it to our attention.
 
 For those concerned, no. Unless you've been punished already, you won't be punished for breaking any of these rules if you broke them before they were posted.
 
 Okay, so. We've covered pretty much [[Retarded|all the rules we can think of.]] What happens when they're broken?
 
 Well, we're unreasonable, so this is how we do:
 
 1. If what you did was only a mild offense, you'll get off with a warning. Don't straighten up, though, because if you get three strikes, and rule-breaking tends to be spastic (so once you get that second, you've pretty much doomed yourself to get the third).
 
 2. If the offense was medium, or you've gotten your third strike, you get a temporary ban. A medium offense ban or third strike for mild offenses will be anywhere from a few days to a week, depending. As mentioned above, if you think you've been dealt with too harshly, you cannot plead your case with another staff member. Know, though, that we do talk to one another about problematic situations.
 
 3. If the offense was harsh, you're going to get a much longer ban. Could be about a month, but that'll be determined by the person dealing with your case. Again, you cannot plead your case, but if you did something warranting a ban longer than a week, chances are good that more than one staff member was involved with the ruling.
 
 4. If the offense was worse than that, or you're discovered to be a [[Lulz|funny]] troll and not an actual member (and we will not know the difference when we check your post history), have fun elsewhere. You'll probably have a better hope of convincing Meyer to accept criticism than having your ban lifted.

After [[Don't feed the trolls|Shadowkyogre's ragequit]], one member [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=13822&p=588206#p588206 posted a complaint about the e-drama.] Sadly no one tried to reduce the e-drama and [[Spam|switched the topic to food.]] 
{{quote|Out of the fora that I frequent (including the Battleon and Giants in the Playground fora) this one has the highest rate of E-drama. No, really. I'm getting the vibe that every littlest thing I say can potentially offend someone, and get myself offended back. I feel I have to tread carefully, especially around the Vent Station and Serious Business area, the latter is exactly what it says on the tin.|thepaladin, who is quoted for truth}}
Someone then [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=13802&p=586539 ran up to the moderators about how to stop the flame wars.] One of the staff members suggested this:
{{quote|Or, better yet, we can create our own counter-macros.|[[Doing it wrong|COUNTER MEMES]][[Truth| ARE STILL MEMES.]]}} [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=588876#p588876 Read more about their failed counter-meme idea here.]
[[Image:Twilightsucksmoderatorisfedupwiththespam.png|frame|center|At this rate, Chaos is probably going to quit.]]
[[Image:Twilightsucksmemberalsohatesthespam.png|thumb|Has this person used memes, improper netspeak, or spammed non-spam topics?]]
Even after the creation of these two threads, the only moderator with any sense is still frustrated with the behavior of TwilightSucks members and [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=14348 announced her frustrations to the public.] Amazingly, the members pretended to listen to her only because [[Asspat|she was a staff member, even though the last two trolls]] [[Lolwut|clearly stated the same problem.]] To add further to the insanity, here is a list of about of the people that agreed with her, even though they misused netspeak, used memes a lot, or changed the topic of a thread to something completely irrational via [[spam]].
*Too Funk To Drunk
*[[Mars Defden]]
*Meghan
*Fujiko
*Zaxoth
*Stormy
*Angel
*Avocados :D
[[Wut|Essentially half of the people that agreed with Chaos were hypocrites.]] Hurry, Chaos! Hurry and flee before you [[Divide_by_zero#Division_by_zero_will_always_create_a_contradiction|become Zaxoth!]]

==[[Lies|We ARE Keeping everything on our own turf and are unbiased]]==
===[[No|ED, Youtube, and dA is their turf?]]===
[[Wrong|Trolling fansites is perfectly bannable over at TwilightSucks]], but if they troll anyone else, it is obviously acceptable because [[No|every other piece of the Internet is theirs.]] They cannot even adhere to their own standards of [[Twitard|not trolling fansites]] because [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1680 they mindlessly praised the ED article about Twitards and contributed to it.] Zaxoth's claim is that only a few people were involved in it, so they are not hypocritical when they praise it. [[Fact|What he actually means is that anyone who does something like that is automatically exiled from the failland of salvation.]] In fact, they staked [[Youtube]] as their own piece of land by [http://twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=24 bitching about Twilight on Youtube.] The [[Sony-Mae]] article also [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=1014 originated from the bowels of the failpit], where people giggled and shit their pants because [[X Y is X|the author for the Twitard article and the Sony-Mae article is the same.]] Trolling [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=13648 deviantArt] [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=13903 weirdos] is perfectly acceptable since [[No|deviantArt is their territory.]] In fact, they believe that [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=13648#p573848 ED is for pushing] [[Moralfag|their biases on other people.]]
====[[NO U|You got us all wrong!]]====
After reading the article, one TwilightSucks member posted a thread concerning its correctness [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=15356 here.] Unlike the troll posts, which had definite authors, the writer of this article was unknown, leading them to go through the typical procedure of [[Doing it wrong|sniffing out who did the article and toss the butthurt word around to make themselves seem lulzy.]] Unfortunately, their attempts to act [[Anti-lulz|cool]] instead showed how much they need something tangible to tear apart when [[Troll|someone points out their flaws.]]

|[[Clique|Maybe it's cause I'm apart of this community,]] but hell, despite what the EDers write, I think TS has [[Truth|done a good job spreading the Anti-lols around.]]|childofthemoor|I say someone is all pissy and whiney because they're not being favored... or they got banned--so they made an ED as an obvious show of how sad they are at revenge|Phoenixangelgal|[[Yes|But so much of it is true.

Certain things are silly. Others are true, in a certain manner of speaking. If the Twitards get a ED, then why not the opposition. Makes things fair. Our opinion does not make us right. It just gives us a different opinion.]]|Silver Ocean|
Not to mention some things are actually incorrect.

This was made by someone butthurt. They're not being lulzy, they're just being a Stephenie Meyer trying to get payback|Phoenixangelgal|
...o___O

Is it just me, or are half of the example threads on that article not even relevant to the points they're trying to make?

...And since when do any of these members spam everywhere and overuse memes? And why am I on the list? :lol:

    Too Funk To Drunk
    Mars Defden
    Meghan
    Fujiko
    Zaxoth
    Stormy
    Kc11(Mmm Boobies)
    Avocados :D


Can anyone think of some incident where some of the people on this list angered some troll or something? Because aside from the staff members (who would obviously be a target to ED trolls anyway) they seem like just random names to me. .__. I don't think anyone on it spams too much or overuses memes.|Stormy, who is clearly clueless|
The fact that they didn't put me on there says a lot, considering I'm a staff member. Not only that, but any average EDiot would have a lot to say about a mod who's into Nazis and black metal. Those two subjects tend to get a lot of mileage at ED.|Blonde Guardian, stating what she believes ED must cover|
And sometimes it's not doing a good job at being a troll; some of the articles read more like butthurt people that ED was originally meant to make fun of.

And how are people taking this badly? From what I see, most of the members here are having a laugh over the fact that whoever wrote that article missed out on some details that can be considered fine ED bait.

Perhaps you should calm down first?|dragonfire5000, pointing out behavior we already predicted|
This. Maybe I missed something, but I don't think anyone in this thread is really whining about the article at all. We're only discussing it.

I know I couldn't care less what some random trolls have to say about me and one of my favorite forums. I actually find it mildly amusing that they're trying so hard. :P|Stormy, pretending to not give a damn|
I kinda take it badly because I think some Ediots decided to give me and BS a rough time with all the Fangirl Encounters.

I think the # of BS stories might have increased when it was put up.|Phoenixangelgal, admitting her views of ED were scarred ever since she and her [[Fantard|friends]] got the wrong end of the stick|
I think that is the point.

ahhh well...some people just seemed like they where getting butt hurt

naaa I'm actually quite calm, truth be told I just found it funny that some people where taking it "SURIOSLY!!" XD|animekitten1992|
And you only continue to prove our point. We constantly come up with new words to riff on the same subject. ED uses the exact same words to riff on a wide variety of subjects. <_<|[[Faulty Logic|More word choice equals more intelligence!]]|
SK is responsible for more than 70% of that article, I can tell you that right now.

The article is so mind-blowingly unfunny, there's no way she couldn't have written it.|Fujiko, expressing distaste because this does not praise them}}

===[[X Y is X|Obvious bias is obvious]]===
Bias is blatantly obvious in TwilightSucks, even though the name of the site already gave that away. Staff members [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=597217#p597217 base morality on how much they like people] instead of [[DO NOT WANT|how well they can do their jobs.]] The more you get along with TwilightSucks members, the more you [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=599097#p599110 contradict yourself.] As if that were not enough, a staff member claimed [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=8494#p294307 she hates special treatment] even though [http://twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=13548&start=25 she openly gives it based on how much she liked a person's ED article.] When one of their idols [http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=12596 cites ED for Internet culture information], they view it as complete truth even though [http://twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=593456#p593456 they lol at others using ED as a source.] [[Truth|None of their behavior makes sense.]]

==Recommended Trolling Techniques==
*[[Truth|Run in and call them a bunch of hypocrites wasting their time by taking the internet too seriously.]] [[Wut|It'll guarantee you at least seven pages of not caring about the internet.]]
*[[TL;DR|Type up a research-paper sized rant]] and post it in the [[Wambulance|Vent Station]] of what looks like complete nonsense (read: bullet 1, as this is just it blown into enormous proportions). [[Questionable logic|They will prove your point by acting the way you want them]][[ADD| and show they have significantly shorter attention spans if it is not about Twilight.]] If you have [[At least 100|100]] posts or more, it will get dumped into the Graveyard rather than the [[Don't feed the trolls|Troll Thread Depository,]] showing that they thought you were an actual member.
*[[Fantard|Tell them you like Twilight the most and can't stand it when people do not like it.]]
*[[Math|Formulate several mathematical equations modeling their behavior. They won't understand a single thing.]]
*[[Epic Win|Fuck it. Just use every technique from this list.]]
