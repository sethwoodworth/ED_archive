HAARP
[[File:HAARP-CompleteMF1-07w.jpg|center|thumb|600px]]
The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, or '''HAARP''', is an American research program funded by the US Air Force and Navy. Its purpose is to analyze the happenings in the ionosphere and the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology. Although that does not sound like a [[lulz]]y topic for ED, read on ([[srsly|trust us]]): HAAARP does far more harm than good. For those who weren’t [[Time Cube|educated stupid]], HAAAARP was responsible for a number of natural and unnatural disasters, including the famous [[Haiti]] earthquake of early 2010 and the recent [[Iceland Volcano 2010|Iceland Volcano Eruption]] . Perhaps HAAAAARP is an example that luminously highlights the positive impact of the [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|US of A]].

According to [[liars|the US government]] and [[TOW]], the HAAAAAAARP project aims to direct a 3.6 MW signal, in the 2.8-10 MHz region of the HF band, into the ionosphere. While this may sound somewhat innocuous, one must recall that in the early 1900s [[Nikola Tesla]] was experimenting with similar concepts of energy projection and ended up destroying a large portion of an uninhabited forest in Siberia. After his death, the US federal government seized his patents, including plans for a device that could, using the principles of resonant frequencies, vibrate things to pieces. While this device was purely physical, Tesla experimented extensively with [[radio]] waves and [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|directed energy]], and one must find it rather suspicious that the government now has a large array of radio antennas, which can be aimed in a way to direct high- and low-frequency energy at any target of their choice.

An easy-to-understand example likens the HAAAAAAAARP array to the reverse of a radio telescope: a device which sends huge amounts of radio energy into the atmosphere and space, rather than receiving signals. The catch, however, is that HAAAAAAAAARP is capable of heating a 1000 square kilometer area of the ionosphere to over 50,000 degrees, bathing the atmosphere with incredible amounts of radiation. It is this radiation that effectively shot down the US Space Shuttle Columbia in [[2003]]. [[Some argue|Some speculate]] that an [[Al-Qaeda]] operative, under the guise of a college student doing research, activated the HAAAAAAAAAARP array on that fateful day in an attempt to disable a communications satellite broadcasting anti-[[Muslim]] [[propaganda]]. Because Muslims are all filthy Godless retards, he was completely unaware that the radiation he had unleashed caught the Columbia in its path, disabling communications, damaging navigation computers, and knocking the lander off-course, essentially shooting it down in midair.

Another useful application of the HAAAAAAAAAAARP project is to affect and control the weather. The array's heating effect on the atmosphere can be utilized to create high and low pressure systems, [[redirect]] the jet streams. This could be used in both positive and detrimental manners, improving the weather in major US cities or causing massive monsoons or super-hurricanes to destroy those less-important countries.

HAAAAAAAAAAAARP was recently thrust into the spotlight once more in the aftermath of the earthquake in [[Haiti]] and the lesser earthquakes occurring in various places around the Earth afterwards. Haiti, however, was not the first example of HAAAAAAAAAAAAARP affecting earthquakes. In [[2008]], a large quake struck [[China]], killing 68,712 people (who were almost immediately replaced by the Chinese government's population control measures.) Before the quake struck, strange glowing clouds appeared, similar to those seen in the Aurora Borealis or those seen as a side effect of HAAAAAAAAAAAAAARP nuking the atmosphere. Clearly HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARP and China's earthquake are related.

The [[Haiti]] earthquake of 2010 is unforgettable to the people of the world. Why so? After all, there were numerous earthquakes before and after [[Shit nobody cares about|about which nobody particularly cared]]. Of course, the contributing factor to it being unforgettable was that every country was trying to suck their people dry by begging for their money to buy watermelons and fried chicken for all of the black person that, unfortunately, survived. This could have never happened, the earthquake or the Jew-inspired actions of sucking money, if HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARP ceased to exist.

<center>{{morphquote|mq3|background-color: white; width: 600px; height: 200px;|font-weight: bold|If you're not a sheeple and you want to dig deeper, author and lecturer Jerry E. Smith's 1998 book Weather Warfare: The Military's Plan to Draft Mother Nature |not for sheeple
|I like the idea that the New World Order is so powerful that it can cause the earth to tremble| re: Jews
|(cont) but so inept that It needs to resort to science fiction weaponry and disinformation disseminated via T-shirts to secure as militarily weak a target of conquest as Haiti| They were scared of the zombies
|That though it hurls thunderbolts like Zeus, it has the eyesight of Mr. Magoo-it can't distinguish one Caribbean island from another.| NWO is blind
|of course haiti was haarped. hait has oil reserves and natural gas reserves not to mention there marble granite limestone coal and aggregate are the purest in the world.So when the gov wants to take over a place of interest they need a reason like a so called natural disaster.Its funny how the only structures in haiti that did not get damaged are the brand new 75million dollar american embassy which is near the airport and the airport.how much you wanna bet halliburton(oilcompany)rebuilds haiti.like they did neworleans and iraq its funny to me how all theese 3 places have oil in common| I guess it's cheaper than say.... taking the oil in a normal way
