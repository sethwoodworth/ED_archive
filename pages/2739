'''Everybody Draw Mohammed Day''' is an event created in 2010 by cartoonist Molly [[Chuck Norris|Norris]] in order to [[troll]] the fuck out of radical [[Muslims]]. It's also the [[Internet]]'s response to the [[censorship]] [[Drama|crisis]] that ''[[South Park]]'' [http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/19/security-brief-radical-islamic-web-site-takes-on-south-park/ recently underwent on April 19, 2010]. The point of this day is to, well, have everyone draw [[Muhammad]], which is well known to be [[blasphemy]] to every [[Muslim|towelhead]] in the world.

==Origins==
On April 25, 2010, Molly declared on a [[Old Media|radio show]] that May 20 shall be Everyone Draw Mohammed Day. She now insists that this was [[Trolls remorse|just her ego talking]] and now she has [[Gay|backed out]] of her responsibility for this glorious day. However, to her [[Oh noes|dismay]], she inadvertently fired up the ol' [[Internet Hate Machine]], and now has thousands of [[us|the typical supporters]] ready to fight for [[Lulz|Freedom of Speech]].

==FaceRage==
Customary to the [[Violent|peaceful]] followers of [[Islam]], they began to protest and threaten to [[Terrorist|blow shit up]] over the [[Internet]]. [[Internet Tough Guy|Yep]]. There are plenty of death threats, repeated [[copypasta|copy and pasted]] "WE STAND AGAINST YOU", [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Everybody-draw-Holocaust-day-30-June-2010/125126400846347?ref=search&sid=NUWzWcyDIxAB-76fbLKq_A.1829720843..1 blaming the Jews], and posting offensive pictures of [[Jesus]] in hopes that it would stop them (It didn't.) Choice quotes include "In our religion mohammed prophet is [[gay|highly exalted]], no one on this earth may drawing him, respect our religion. If any people on here from hardliner know this article and know where you are, you may be killed. Please respect our religion or you will [[buttsecks|punished]] by my god Allah SWT", "All unbelievers will burned in hell! I will kill you all!", and the occasional [[Oxymoron|sane Muslim]] who says "Yes it’s offensive, but that’s how the world works, GET OVER IT." or "Way to make muslims look bad."

==Everyone blocks Facebook==
[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100519/ap_on_hi_te/as_pakistan_facebook On May 19, 2010, [[Pakistan]]'s government made Internet service providers block Facebook until the end of May.] The [[Osama Bin Laden|prominent residents of Pakistan]] were then unable to play [[Mafia Wars|Sheikh Wars]] with [[Terrorist|their friends]] during that time. 2,000 [[female]] [[Muslim]] students rallied to have the page removed, and [[male]] students wanted a [[Jihad|holy war]] on the [[trolls]]. "Down with Facebook!" was chanted outside courtrooms. [[Facebook]] itself said the images were not against their TOS, however.

Basically, they were trolled [[IRL]].

On the 30th of May, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/10192755.stm Bangladesh decided to join in], citing satirical images of both Muhammed and various political figures, notably the founder of the country and their current leaders, as the cause. They even arrested a man for "spreading malice and insulting the country's leaders" after he allegedly posted some images.

==Nuke Time!==
Predicably enough, after the group on [[Facebook]] garnered <b>70,000 fans</b> and almost 6,000 pieces of artwork blaspheming against Mohammed, the Facebook admins [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|wiped it off the face of the internet]]. The official reason was supposed to be that the group content was [[lemon party|too vulgar]], but everyone knows that Facebook's dictators removed it because they were being threatened with slit throats if they didn't.

The original Facebook group was returned, but with 90% less Mohammed [[buttfucking]].

On the night of the 20th of May, the group disappeared again. At that point it had reached over 110,000 fans and [[OVER 9000|more than 10,000]] pieces of artwork.

Three days later the page was online again with moderators claiming that one of them had been hacked, and this hacker had [[banhammer|deleted the group]].

==It's Over?==
On May 24, 2010, admin of the group posted this...

[[File:Delete_mohammad_day.PNG|center]]

But fuck that, keep drawing!

==Everyone Drawing Muhammad==

Make sure [[you]] draw Muhammad/Mohammed/what-the-fuck-ever too! If you [[deviantART|can't draw]], just make a bunch of scribbles and call it Muhammad. That pisses them off too.

==Everybody Draw the Holocaust Day==
Apparently, some humourless Islamic Holocaust-Deniers decided to make their own special (as in short bus special) form of Anti-Lulz. They reached up into their rectums and pulled out "Everybody Draw the Holocaust Day"; which, Unlike "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day", almost went by without making a single ripple. Here's one of the few JewTube videos that even acknowledge that it had happened.
{{ytplus|Muslims Even Fail at Trolling|<youtube>Iwb4k3Cb4zw</youtube>|Fuck You...|OGjimbo, One of the few people who even noticed the Moslemoron's weaksauce attempt to be "edgy" and "transgressive"}}
And that is why you should only leave Lulz to people who are capable of laughter and creativity.
