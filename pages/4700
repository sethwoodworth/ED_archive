'''LOL INTERNET''' is a meme started [[at least 100 years ago]] by Dunkinbean, a [[Pokemon]]-loving [[furfag]] ([http://wildcritters.us/wc/user/show/77 the] [http://dunkinbean.deviantart.com/ proof]), first used when the [[Internet]] wasn't treated seriously, which makes it the exact opposite of [[The Internet Is Serious Business|Internet: Serious Business]]. It is the phrase that best summarizes the internet in its entirety.

It is also quite popular on [[YTMND]], and has spawned so many crappy spin-offs that any [[lulz]] it originally had is long gone by now.
