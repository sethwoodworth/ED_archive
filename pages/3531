Following the exile of [[Bill Mitchell]] from the world wide internets, [[Failure|Anonymous]] strike groups set their sights on the Initialized.org IRC network, where [[Bill_Mitchell]] had made his home. After scaring the living fuck out of half the rooms on the servers, causing sites to shut down their [[Image:FACE.JPG|frame|Awsome how selective you are with pictures. Lovely how you're all cowards behind the screen, except for the target. Amirite?]]forums in fear Anonymous might target them next, these Anon groups, dubbing themselves [[Zangaroa]] and [[Substantia]], discovered a sand-black person by the name of [[faggot|"krono6"]] who was confident in his [[failure|assessment]] that the /i/nvaders were not [[Failure|Anonymous]]. He then proceeded to break [[Rules_of_the_internet|Rules 1 and 2]] by attempting to [[homeschooling|"educate"]] Init-IRC admins about Anonymous, backing them up with his own falsified claims that he himself was [[an_hero|an Anon]].




=== Internet Drama ===
Gurkirat Vig or "Krono6" typically frequents the now [[owned|obsolete]] channel #tmoti on irc.initialized.org due to some expert Psy placement there is [[serious_business|SRS]] internet drama afoot in certain channels on the server and it would appear that there is an average of three lulz a minute being produced from Initialized. Unfortunately the server appears to be on lockdown and newcomers are not invited. One brave anon however did manage to retrieve this nugget of lulz:<br>
<BR>''
<anakira> Topic for #tmoti is: --! Welcome to TMOTI / www.insatiablemind.com / Official Channel made of muff and jig-jig -- You must be 15 years or older to enter this channel unless otherwise permitted by an op -- Krono6's passwords have been stolen. If you are fucking around, stop now<br>

=== Gurkirat on Password Security ===
''<Krono6> [[amirite|Don't keep brutable passwords]], and that's 'all' you need to do. (''LOL, half this fuckers passwords were "kissmybutt" - ED'')

The real drama was created when [[Anonymous]] was able to read user to channel communications on the IRC server because of an extra installed node. A BIG shoutout to Init-IRC for your lack of security.
