The '''iPhone''' is an iPod...with coast-to-coast tard talk. You used to be able to call fellow [[Fucktards|fucktards]] and tell them about how you just spent the fantastically large amount of [[PS3|$599 U.S. Dollars]] for your sweet new tele full of [[crapp]], but since [[noone]] wanted to pay retarded prices for a phone Walmart now sells them for $99. Jewfails love the iPhone because it sucks dick, and it is the only thing they like more than Jewgold and ovens.

==Bend over, Apple incoming==
The iPhone is Apple's newest way to Jew you, hardcore. The phone retails at $5,000-$6,000 Jesus bucks, but only costs Apple $250 and a bowl of rice (to feed the Asian) to make. Don't forget when the battery dies (and it will) you get to send it to Apple and pay them to have one of their Asians, monkeys or Asian monkeys to do something every other phone company in the world allowed you to do yourself.  They will also delete all your data on your phone, too, because they're too lazy to back your data up. If any Jewfails were to complain, it's off to the oven, you [[Nazi]]!

''Pros''
*Screen that fat people will smudge with their sausage fingers.
*Fingerprint identification (see above).
*Get more dates at the gay bar.
*Easily digestible for the average fat person.
*Pretty colors.
*Blendtec blenders blend it.
*You can break an [[Xbox]] by dropping an iPhone bill on it.
*You can start a 7.5 [[HÃ¦ti|earthquake]] by dropping an iPhone bill on the floor.
*The older phone got cheaper plans with AT&T than most of AT&T's smartphones, but now that's all gone...
*GPS

''Cons''
*DOES NOT COME WITH A HELMET (Dual purpose, lets other people know you're a tard and prevents head trauma related to tardness).
*People sound like robotic shit.
*Can't see the screen at all when you are in full sunlight.
*Could't capture video until the third 3GS came out, making you shell out even [[moar]] jewgoldz for it.
*The camera is like a Jewfail rip-off.
**Most [[Apple]] fans enjoy taking videos of [[you]] touching them to take a glimpse at their waste of money.
*[[Maddox]] [http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=iphone has a full rundown].
*Does not teleport (despite promises to the contrary).
*No [[pirate|free software]].
*Each software update is over 200 megs and can only be downloaded through iTunes and iTunes refuses to pause or save the download so when you get disconnected, you have to re-download the whole thing. iTunes, like Quicktime, changes to a new version every 2 days requiring a 70 meg download each through Apple's software updater program.
*Screen cannot be cleaned with anything capable of disinfecting such as ammonia or even alcohol. Attempting to do so will break the iPhone.
*1/1000 of a single sprinkle drop of water will destroy your iPhone, hence invaliding your warranty.
*No insurance - once dropped, you have to buy a new one.
*<s>No AD2P, cant use your shinny wireless bluetooth headphones.</s> It's A2DP dipshit (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile), and it does now.
*<s>Multitasking is for fags, its retro like [[DOS]].</s> <s>added in version 4.0</s> that's not actually multitasking.
*<s>No copy and paste, you need to be [[Che|revolutionary]].</s> added in version 3.0
*<s>No MMS to keep uncool people without iPhones away from you.</s> added in version 3.0
*1337 [[Dutch|tulip muncher]] PureInfinity92 used the default jailbreak password infecting iPhones with a worm for an extortion attempt[http://www.sophos.com/blogs/gc/g/2009/11/03/hacked-iphones-held-hostage-5-euros/]. The same vulnerability is exploited by [[Ashley Towns|Auzzi haxor ikee]] to rickroll iPhones with much greater win and Sophos credits ikee with the first iPhone worm.

==Service Provider==
As if it isn't enough that [[retard|retards]] are shelling out [[OVER 9000|over 9,000]] dollars for their [[shit|shitty]] overpriced phone that nobody will call them on anyway because they [[You don't have any friends|have no friends]], you also have to use [[Rapist|AT&T]], which will stick it [[in the ass|in your ass]] every month with a 300 page bill that is [[XBox|HUGER THAN XBOX!!111!!1ONEONE1]]

The Jews at Apple were successfully [[Trolling IRL|trolled IRL]] by one of their own when hobbit Frodo Baggins, under the internet handle "geohot", unlocked the iPhone after he refused to believe that [[One does not simply X into Mordor|one does not simply unlock an iPhone]].  Now lucky [[Retard|iPhone users]] can use their iPhones on T-Mobile.  EVERYBODY REJOICE!  A few hours after [[Lie|saying he didn't want to make money off of his work]], Frodo placed the phone [http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=230164884672|up for sale on eBay], along with this gem on his [[blog]]:

{{quote|I am hoping to buy a car with the money, as my previous summer project was going to be fixing up my 3000GT, which I got the engine out of, but never could quite get in back in :)|geohot cashing in on his [[Unwarranted self-importance|fame]].}}

===How to make money off of iPhone===

# For $50 each, buy counterfeit unlocked iPhones from Asia with removable batteries (save customers $80 bucks plus $50 phone rental when changing the battery).
# Sell on eBay. (All iPhones sold on eBay are unlocked and all unlocked sold as new are counterfeit.)
# Close the bank account associated with your [[PayPal]] account when customers file disputes for their money back in PayPal.
# After being suspended from eBay, sell the fake iPhone on [[iOffer]] where counterfeits are welcome with open arms.
# ??????
# [[Profit|Profit!!!]]

:'''or'''
# Eat a tulip.
# Build iPhone worm which tells people to visit a website where you will fix their iPhone for 5 euro.
# Get [[Trolls remorse|Troll's remorse]].
# Return the extorted money and post instructions on how to remove the worm.

==iPhone 4==

[[Image:Ihand.jpg|thumb|Apple's solution to the right hand service problem.]]
OMGWTF IT'S THE NEWEST IPHONEPHWOAR!!!!11

Steve HandJobs announced the newest iPhone last week. 

Features:
*Can only be used right handed(Unless you want no bars)
*It's got a four on the end. Which raises the question "Where was the iPhone 2?"
*Apple hiding that they are still jealous of Google and Adobe.
*<s>[[Fail|Still not on Verizon]]</s> [[shit no one cares about|Now out on Verizon]] you can jailbreak it to work with [[Shit|T-MOBILE!!!!111]]
*Still doesn't support Flash, and [[nothing of value was lost]].
*Isn't Android!!!
*It's thinner so Apple fags can stick it up their anuses easier.
*Retina Display, which is marketing bullshit.
*Blessed by Pope Steve Jobs III
*It's still basically the iPhone 3GS with a 2nd camera on the front and a different resolution.
*Glass on both the front and the back, so you know its indestructible. In fact, it's so indestructible, that cases cause it to break[http://www.cultofmac.com/are-slide-on-cases-cracking-your-iphone-4-take-the-poll/62252]
*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHk3wYrkk7U Steve Jobs try too hard to be apathetic about the iPhone failing]

[[Image:Whoapaple.jpg|Authors: Someone with too much time on their hands.]]

===FailTime===

[[Image:Facetimefail.jpg|thumb|FaceTime is one of the new iPhone features.]]

Even though this technology has been around for years, Apple still can't perfect it - FaceTime still sucks balls even though it's over WiFi. It's like Apple somehow manages to freeze a pizza in an oven.

You could always stick [[Skype|with what you were using before]], but OMG I LOVE APPLE TOO MUCH TO DO THAT.

Still, let's hope [[Camwhore|people]] [[Living_On_A_Prayer|learn how to use this]]..

==iPhone 3G==

[[Image:Iphone vs stone.jpg|thumb|Apple edges out the competition.]]

Announced [[Last Thursday]] Crapple found a new way to piss off [[fanboys]] by releasing a new phone a year later.
 
The features include:
*3G To download your [[CP]] faster, which will also get you [[V&]] quicker, and that's if you're in one of AT&T's shitty ass 3G coverage areas.
*GPS, which stands for Get Past [[Niggers|Spear Chuckers]]. Now your iPhone will tell you [[Where da hood at|what place is a black neighborhood]] so you can quickly [[GTFO]]
*Better battery life. Only 10 minutes longer! [[Divide by 0|But it eats up the battery twice as fast]].
*Higher bills. Pay $10 more for the SAME PHONE a month!
*[[Irony|Tiny fucking cracks all over the phone you bought because it looks good]].
*A soon to be announced recall because of a glitched 3G antenna amplifier that makes the iPhone not pick up 3G coverage in the same areas that other phones do. Quality Engineering.

The iPhone still won't get you laid....unless if you want to continue to get [[fuck]]ed in the ass by an [[AIDS]]-infected [[Steve Jobs]].

==iPhone 3G NOW WITH S==
[[Image:Iphone-burn-1.jpg|thumb|iPhones now catch fire!]]
The jews over at apple realized how fail the iPhone 3G sometime [[Last Thursday]] and decided if they put an S on the end it would all be better. What it really did was add all the [[Shit|features]] that should have been included but they were too stupid to implement.

These include:
*HOLY SHIT 2x FASTER THAN THE IPHONE 3G
*Video camera
*Voice control
*[[copypasta|Cut and Paste]]
*Voice recording
*[[extreme advertising|Turn that bitch on its side and its a LANDSCAPE FUCKIN' KEYBOARD]]
*A compass? Really?
and much more useless shit you probably won't need in a phone.


The 3GS now has a killswitch that won't let the phone work when it reaches 113F/45C. [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,529705,00.html]  Now if you live in [[The Middle East]], near [[Arizona]], in [[Egypt]], or in anywhere else that regularly gets over 110F/43C for most of the year, then guess what?  Your iPhone 3GS just will never work!

==How to commit EPIC FAIL using an iPhone==

[[Image:Iphone_virginity_epic_fail.jpg|thumb|right|The message, along with a picture of said whore.]]

[[Last Thursday]] some dumb [[16 year old]] [[whore]] (excuse the redundancy) had [[buttsecks]] and lost her [[virginity]] on a beach, the slut was so pleased that she felt the immediate need to tell her [[bff]] and wrote her a message with the text "[[OMG]]! Just had 1st time on beach! Gr8! wish u were here", but being the dumb cunt she is she sent it to her [[daddy]], creating much drama and [[lulz]].

Way to go, silly bitch!

==Camera Phone==

If you're going to take photos of your aunt in the shower or attempt to kill a cat remember, that the iPhone's photos contain the GPS coordinates within the EXIF data of each photo. It is [[fail|always]] important to remember to remove such [[Fbi|evidence]] before posting photos on [[b]].

Image:Cat_killer_location.jpg|[[fail|Attempted]] cat killer lives here.
</gallery></center>

=='''Conclusion'''== 
Asshats buy iPhones, don't be an asshat.

The iPhone is the anti-lulz, and only meant for Jewfails.

=='''Trivia'''==
*You have to supply your own lube when you take it up the ass for a 500 dollar phone.
*[[Android|Other phones]] have more features and still look good.
*People in the [[United States]] are more likely to spend money on a worthless item with an [[Apple]] logo while taking it up the ass from a [[horse]] than get a job and contribute to the [[Earth]]

[[image:Iphone2.jpg|thumb|right|Works 100 times betterer than your shitty ass iPhone 4GS. Clothes optional]]

For [[niggers|those]] who can't afford a cell phone plan. You can get the [[iPod]] Touch. It's the same fucking thing only it costs $50-100 dollars more but theres no fucking phone!!!!!111 More Jewry from Apple.

Or better yet, get a [[Windows]] Phone and tape an apple on it. Hey presto, [[Lie|a better iPhone!]] With food included!

==But What's iff Eye's Already Boughtendghd an Iphonezors??==
[[An hero|Kill yourself.]]

==[[Baby fuck|Baby Shaker]]== 
Sometime [[last Thursday]], Apple decided to troll its customers by approving a "Baby Shaker" game for the iPhone, in which: "Baby Shaker makes revolutionary use of the iPhone and iPod Touch's accelerometer to simulate killing a crying infant. When the app starts up with its wailing and carrying on, simply shake it to make it stop. You'll know it's worked when the crying is over and two red Xs appear over the baby's eyes. See? FUN. Not realizing the reality distortion field was turned off at this time, the media response was negative, and it had to be pulled. So if you're an iPhone user and you want to fulfill your dream of shaking little screaming shits until they are dead virtually, you're out of luck.

The Baby Shaker incident set off a worldwide media firestorm. The following is a timeline of the Baby Shaker incident, from the article on KRAPPS.com which broke the news to ultimately Apple pulling Baby Shaker from the App Store and issuing a public apology (which is rare, Apple does not publicly apologize too often):

== Guys With iPhones ==
Just to prove that iPhones are for spoiled [[Homosexuality|fags]], GuysWithiPhones consists of guys camwhoreing themselves in the mirror with iPhones. This inevitably gets followed by comments from a mixture of gay men and a few women that (a) fawn over their hawt bodies, (b) fawn over their choice of cellphone, (c) make irritating nitpicks about the photos forgetting that most are taken in the mirror and (d) obsessively stalk them and link to YouTube videos that show them. It's fucking depressing, but is a useful link when you want to argue with someone asserting that people who aren't queer use iPhones.
