BABY, THE STARS SHINE BRIGHT
[[Image:Btssb.gif|thumb|300px]]
'''BABY, THE STARS SHINE BRIGHT''', or ''BTSSB'' for short, is a [[japanese]] company that sells [[EGL|loli]] clothing. Most of these articles are overpriced pieces of [[crap]], likely crafted by [[fucktard]]ed asian women who think that people actually look good wearing their [[shit]]. All of the clothes sold here look like something only an 8 year old ([[sick fuck|or younger]]) would wear, therefore whenever a [[whore|girl]] wears it, [[pedophiles]] can safely assume she's just [[asking for it]] because only [[attention whore]]s actually buy this trash.  

BABY, THE STARS SHINE BRIGHT is located in [[Japan|Shibuya, Tokyo]] and is the most basic representative of [[EGL]] style. The store is a haven for chicks with absolutely no fashion sense and a [[Peter Pan]] complex. Since [[weeaboos]] must take everything from the [[Japan|land of the rising sun]] and pervert it as much as possible, some of them actually buy this expensive shit and wear it to anime conventions for bonus loser points. BTSSB is an exclusive [[EGL|loli]] brand, and the fact that they threw away their money on brand-name clothing gives them a bigger [[e-penis]] as a result.  

Since BTSSB is a very typical label of the [[EGL|lolita]] style, it a common tag for the Shibuya fashion subculture in popular culture such as doramas, [[manga]], and [[anime]]. Note that all of these references to [[EGL]] are in Japan because no sane person in America would pay any amount of attention to this sort of ridiculousness, except maybe [[Fox News]]. [[fat|Obesity]] by itself is far more newsworthy than buying/wearing these articles of disgustingness and trying to act Japanese, [[fail|while being fat at the same time]]. Right?

How do you make your shit merchandise appeal to people? Combine it with some overhyped shit! This is exactly the case with this fashion line. It is full of shit. Tasteless shit.

== Buyers beware! ==
What is normal ''in'' Japan isn't necessarily normal ''outside'' Japan. Take [[hentai]], used panty vending machines, the 4,387 different [[crap|KitKat]] flavors found in Japanese stores, [[gay|Razor Ramon HG]] and Junichiro Koizumi's hair for example.
