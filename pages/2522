'''''E.T. (The Extra Terrestrial)''''' is a [[Pedophilia|magical]] [[Propaganda|film]] about an [[Mexican|alien]], whos parents hate the fucking sight of him, so they do a [[Maddie|"Maddie"]], dumping him on earth.  He then goes on to [[Rape|befriend]] a [[13-year-old boy|young boy]] called Elliott, before fucking off [[Mexico|home]].

[[Image:ETMJ.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Learning to [[molest|entertain]] from the master]]Creaming at the prospect of a [[Star Wars|Star Wars]] type franchise, Shlomo [[Sell Out|auctioned off]] E.T. to the highest bidder.  As a result, there was narely a surface to be seen that didn't bear E.T.'s [[Retarded|loveable]] visage.  Rumour has it, that Michael Jackson paid $1M for one night alone with the puppet (and not even the mechanical one, with a robotic mouth).  E.T. didn't mind tho, since his asshole was already gaping, due to the combined force of Senor Spielbergo and his [[Jews|associates]].

== The Infamous Atari Game ==

[[image:ET2600-TheBestPart.png]]
Pioneering the now tedious tradition of releasing a shit computer game on the back of the success of a film, Spielberg & Co. decided to cash in on the [[Oh exploitable|fantastic potential]] of E.T. by [[Prostitute|selling]] the film rights to [[Atari]].  Unfortunately the game was so dire that what was forecast as [[Profit]][[Oneoneone|!!!!!11111]] for the people at Atari, ended up in [[EPIC FAIL]], with Atari being reported as "[[An hero]]ed" [[Last Thursday]].  Then, like all American problems, the shady East took [[JEWS DID WTC|the fall]] and [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|almost all]] copies of the game were taken to the Iraqi desert where Atari gifted the sacred land with trillions of tons of imperishable plastic.
