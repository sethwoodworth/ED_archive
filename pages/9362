'''Zinedine Yazid Zidane''' ([[Moonspeak|English translation]]: "the son of a [[terrorist]] whore") is a former [[French]] [[soccer]] player that played for both the French national team and for four European club teams, most recently [[Mexico|Real Madrid]]. Zidane is a hothead with a quick temper -like an angry [[Furry|bull]], he [[In_the_ass|pummeled]] [[Guido|Marco Materazzi]] with incredible force. No one really knows the real reason why he did it but some say that all he wanted was [http://zidanewantscandy.ytmnd.com/ Materazzi's candy] (not of the man variety) but some other say that he just [[did it for the lulz]], in that case who can really blame him?. Despite the headbutt incident, Zidane won the Golden Ball (haha). [[Star Wars|Forza Italia]]!!!

== Incident details==
[[At_least_100_years_ago|About 100 minutes]] into the 2006 World Cup final against [[Italy]], Zidane was sent off for [[pwn]]ing Marco Materazzi via headbutt . Video replays showed Materazzi [[Gay|holding Zidane]] and [[asking for it|pulling his shirt lightly]] after Italy had captured the ball in an attack by the French team. Materazzi let go, and after a brief exchange of words (including "you fucking French fuck"), Zidane walked away from him. Then, the Italian appeared to be saying something - eyewitness reports by lipreaders have him saying "your mother was a nice fuck." Zidane turned around, took a few short steps, [[Fellatio|lowered his head]] and racked his skull against Materazzi, [[pwned|sending him to the ground]]. Play was halted and referee Horacio Elizondo shouted "Wop got wapped!" After the intervention of another official, Zidane was shown the red card and [[fail|sent off]].

== Reactions to the incident ==
After the French national football team returned to Paris, President Jacques Chirac hailed Zidane as a national hero, a "virtuoso" and "a genius of world football." He added: "You are also a man of heart and conviction. That is why [[France]] [[Bobba|admires and loves you]]."

The rest of the world chalked the incident up to Zidane being fucking [[French]].
