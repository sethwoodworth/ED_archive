IRL drama
[[Image:Drama.jpg|frame|Oh! Yes, the drama, we know, we know.]]
'''IRL drama''' is [[drama]] that happens [[IRL|in real life]], as opposed to [[Internet drama]]. IRL drama can cause [[Internet]] drama (ex. [[bitch]] cheats on her [[Boyfriend|bf]] with another guy, then posts about it), and Internet drama can cause IRL drama (ex. post about [[Nazi]]s reveals a friend's [[DAMN NIGGA]] or [[God hates fags|homosexuals]] and causes an IRL fist fight). 

IRL drama is what inspired [[Hepkitten]] to create [[LJDrama]] in the first place.

'''IRL drama''' is the ancestor of [[Internet drama]]. In [[Before the internets|the olden days]] before [[forum]]s and [[blogs]] were established to help [[16 year old girls]] vent about their meaningless daily drivel, they depended on word of mouth to [[flame]] each other so they wouldn't be confronted face-to-face and risk damaging their [[anorexic]] shells.

Through IM's, forums, blogs, and sites like Hi5 they can now lead entire [[flame wars]] without ever even seeing the other person, knowing who they are, and maintaining their safety while picking on someone 3,000 miles away.  

A prime example of IRL drama would be the [[Lollercaust|Holocaust]], in which IRL Jew Jerry Seinfeld made a comment along the lines of "Adolf's momma is a real [[cunt]]". Understandably, [[Adolf Hitler]] wanted to get back at Seinfeld, and evened the score. This is not only an example of IRL drama, but also a prime example of [[Superman|Justice]].
