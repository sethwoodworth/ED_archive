'''Ket''' (aka ''Thedreadedkettle'', ''el oh el'', ''KangaJew'') was an ex-ED sysop who would have remained sysop but he disappeared one day under mysterious circumstances.  It wasn't until five years later that he was spotted again, on [[WikiFur]], surprisingly being a proud donor [http://en.wikifur.com/index.php?title=User:El%2C_oh%2C_el&oldid=149693] [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/WikiFur:Ledger].  Ket does not remember the five missing years.  He only remembers on the night of his disappearance there were strange lights the in the sky and then a few hours later bright lights filled his room.  The next thing he knew, he was dropped off naked in a corn field and five years had mysteriously gone by.

Being that he was now a furry as proven by his Wikifur donation, he was desysopped from [[ED]] per policy that furries are not allowed to be sysops.

== Sex ==
He uses [http://web.archive.org/web/20060101030328/www.fu-fme.com/index.html this handy attachment].
Ket committed suicide at 12:44 AM, Sept. 25th. He was not missed. So he was reincarnated as himself so he could [[yiff]] all those he had not endeared himself to.

When asked why he went and fucked with the article on [[niggers]], he said "Cause it was mindless racism without an iota of wit"

==[[Duke Otterland|Ket]] and [[Google]]==
As we all know, [[Google]] makes cutesy, [[shit nobody cares about|custom]] default front pages for special occasions - like [[Kramer|Martin Luther Coon Day]] and [[Ramadan|Xmas]]. What you may not know is that Ket gave [[Google]] his boomerang and didgeridoo collection to celebrate <i>his</i> special days.

Proof of which is presented below in two such examples ED's [[crack]] team [[Google|dug up]].
