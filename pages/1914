Cute Shit
[[File:Dumbooctopus.jpg|right|thumb|[[GTFO]] My internets!]]
'''Cute shit''' is an all-encompassing term to describe the chronically [[unfunny]] and disgustingly saccharine content that makes its way on to the Interbutts for the amusement of borderline retarded [[NORP]]s and their children. It comes in many flavors, but is always recognizable for its clean-cut attempt at humor, the [[Fail|epic failure]] of this humor, and its patent attempts to look "cute" so that the viewers get a double dose of their electronic retard pills for the day. They might be [[YTMND|retarded GIF animations looping ad infinitum set to idiotic music]], CGI characters performing a well known song from the 60's, or one of those long-ass [[HTML]] intense forwarded emails you get from middle-aged people who thought what they found was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNY LOL. 

==The Failure==

Cute Shit is as old as the fucking interbutts, and probably started with that goddamned [[Dancing Baby]] shit. Note that this automatically makes all Cute Shit instantly [[old meme]] While some early internauts were busy discovering all the neat ways they could send each other [[hawt]] [[CP]] without the need for unsightly stacks of VHS tapes, the vast majority were plugged into [[AOL]] or Netscape and decided that the infinite power of the tubes would best serve mankind if they sent retarded humor-based emails over the company servers. 

The following examples of Cute Shit are here solely for the purposes of illustration. Retardization caused by viewing of any of these videos is the sole responsibility of the video's creators, and they should be [[Funnelgirl|punished]] accordingly.

Based on [[Original research]], any moderately intelligent person with a good sense of humor (i.e. not [[you]]) finds this shit containing a merciless level of [[frunz]]. While [[13 year old boys]] and [[16 year old girls]] might stumble upon these over inflated crap flakes and [[lol]] in their e-pants, Cute Shit is what middle-aged NORPS look up when they aren't doing their banking or looking up [[Sick_Fuck|South Australian farting lesbian midget cumshot porn]]. As they are unaware of superior forms of [[lulz|humor]], and would probably be disgusted by it anyways, they are the target audience of Cute Shit, and will either generate or repost whatever comes their way.

==Pathology Report==

It is already well-known that the [[Internet]] is a shallow mass grave of stillborn attempts at humor that get shat out of every Tom, Dick and Harry once he realized that his idiocy was no longer confined to his immediate friends and family. Cute Shit, however, is often propagated by those without relevant understanding of the internets - while it may be sufficient to tell [[newfags]] to [[lurk moar]], people who indulge in Cute Shit probably remember the good ole days when they used typewriters at work, and also probably called a support line just to turn their shitbox computer on.

Fortunately, the almost radioactive levels of anti-lulz these people generate can easily be converted through the Internet Haet Machine into delicious, safe-to-consume lulz. Simply visit any of the forums they might have located, their Myspace/Facebook page or blog. Post up every shock image, video and link, cleverly disguised as more Cute Shit, then sit back and watch as they collectively shit brix. They might even call the [[cyber police]] on you for extra lulz-points, so make sure that you scar them well.

If going for the high score, remember that you can do this to people you know, like [[your mom]] or some similarly old fuck. So long as you're behind seven proxies, chances are they won't realize your sick fuckery and scream [[IRL]] for your [[trolling]] delight. Bon appetit, asshole.
