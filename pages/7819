'''Steve MacIsaac''' was born like many [[Canadia|Canadian]] boys, slightly retarded and with a vestigial tail, but as Steve approached [[13-year-old boy|adolescence]] the trouble started. A friend of Steve's taught him the phrase "[[Bros B4 Hoes|bros before hoes]]" and Steve took it a little too seriously. He began involving exclusively men in all aspects of his life, including work, play and ''especially'' sex.

But one day the sex was not enough. No matter how many assholes Steve rammed, the [[buttsecks]] [[IRL|reality]] never lived up to his [[buttsecks]] [[fantasy]]. Frustrated and dejected, Steve packed up his things and embarked on a gay spirit quest. He travelled to [[San Francisco]], [[Uruguay|U-R-Gay]] and finally the [[Internets]], where he [[Cum|came]] upon the great and powerful [[Goatse]].

From the depths of [[Goatse]] spurt forth '''The Shits of Knowledge''' and in an instant Steve was granted knowledge of [[Art|The Arts]], through which his most frightening and fagaliscious fantasies could be granted life using pen and paper alone.  

Steve immediately set pen to paper and such a torrent of faggotry flowed from his hands that the [[cock|dongs]] of [[Heaven]] tolled, the sky turned prolapse red and '''Fagnarok''' engulfed the [[Earth]]. The '''Gay Titans''' broke free of their thousand-year prison of frozen [[santorum]] and [[buttsecks|buttsecksed]] the [[Earth]] and everything in it to death, or even worse, gaiety.

Well actually, Steve just drew a [[Macrophile|macrophilic]] picture of a [[bear]] about to [[Secks|fuck]] a boat, along with various other faggy [[Webcomics|webcomics]] and [[Books|books]], but it was still pretty [[bad]].

==[[Webcomic]]==

[[image:Gay weightlifter from behind.gif|thumb|That Adobe速 Illustrator速 sure is a great artist!]]

Every storyline in Steve's [[webcomic]], Roughs, follows the same basic plot:
#A bear gets bored.
#The [[bear]] fucks a random street-fag to relieve said boredom.
#The [[bear]] gets [[AIDS|GAIDS]] (duh).
#The [[bear]] spends the rest of his disease ridden life trying to indoctrinate poor defenceless children into the shameful cycle of buggery and [[AIDS|GAIDS]]. 

As for his [[art]] style, Steve uses these basic steps in creating his webcomic:
#Draws a rough picture in pencil.
#Lets [[Adobe|Adobe速 Illustrator速]] do all the inking for him.
#Uses the paintbucket tool to fill in the colours.
#Has one of his gay-sex slaves upload it to the [[internets]], while he goes and eats another lard sandwich (''*[[LOL]]*, because he's fat *[[LOL]]*'').

The horrifying thing is, that despite having horrible art and conveying a disturbing pro-fag propaganda message, his [[webcomic]] still has quite a large [[Fandom|cult following]].

But instead of drinking poisoned [[Kool-Aid]], these [[retards|cultists]] drink poisoned semen. Poisoned '''ANIMAL SEMEN!'''

==IRL Name = IRL Fame?==
'''Steve MacIsaac''' has decided to forego using an alias and instead use his [[powerword]] as his [[screen name]].

His reasoning behind this is that it will enable his [[internets]] notoriety to trickle over into [[IRL]].

In actuality, it will probably just enable [[/b/|/b/tards]] to track him down, knock on his door and request [[buttsecks]], which he will no doubt provide with gusto. Twelve weeks later, the buttbabies, that will fill future ranks of [[Anonymous]], are born and the circle of retardedness is complete.

'''[[PROTIP]]: IRL name = IRL shame!'''

==A Published Author==

[[Image:SHIRTLIFTER-COVER.gif|thumb|Beware its innocuous cover!]]

[[Image:Sticky Cover.jpg|thumb|Beware its nocuous cover!]]

'''Steve MacIsaac''' has published at least three [[evil]] [[sodomy]] manuals, or as the gays call them "fag rags". The titles of these "fag rags" are "Sticky", "Shirtlifter" and "Shirtlifter 2: The Bloodening".

Priced at $5 and under, these "fag rags" are less about making money than they are about encouraging  adults and especially [[children]] to engage in illicit [[buttsecks]].

All freedom loving individuals must [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|kill these books with fire]], lest our glorious nation be embroiled in [[buttsecks|buggery]].
 
==It's Not Just Faggotry, It's ''Award-Winning'' Faggotry!==
'''Steve MacIsaac''' has somehow used his evil [[Magic|homomancy]] to hypnotize the Xeric Foundation and Prism Comics into awarding him grants[http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/05/08/spring-2007-xeric-grant-winners-announced/][http://www.prismcomics.org/display.php?id=1137], because while under his spell, they believed that providing him with money to make more "fag rags" would be an [[epic]] win for mankind.

Unfortunately, after the spell wore off and these poor fucks realized the dishonour they had caused themselves, they committed [[seppuku]], leaving their wives and children to starve in the streets.
