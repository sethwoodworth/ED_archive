==The most creative thread ever.==

A lovely bit of cancer running rampant all over /b/, the 'doubles' thread is popular among [[newfags]] with no imagination. Currently comprising 90% of /b/, this template works off a simple, yet profound revelation which still [[BDSM|holds /b/ in thrall:]] OMG YOUR POST GETS A NUMBER!!![[GET|11]] 

This in hand, any [[retarded|hilarious]] basement dweller can make a post attempting to bag those elusive double digits, hopefully recieving the promised bauble. (Tits, naming of the proffered phallus, CP etc.)

However, as OP is almost invariably fag, [[unrealistic expectations|don't expect a follow-through any time soon.]]

[[FYI]], 1 in every 10 posts ends in dubz. It's about as big a deal as Wednesday coming or [[Chris-Chan]] getting pissed off.

==Picture==

99% of '''doubles''' threads start with a picture of [[Patrick Bateman]] from the most epic movie evar, [[American Psycho]], pointing at the post number however, since [[newfags]] can't [[torrent]] movies, 99% of them have no idea that Christian Bale was in any movie other than [[Batman]]. This is textbook faggotry and warrants copious amounts of [[sage]].

==Examples==

* "Doubles names my new [[cat]]\[[dog]]\baby\[[penis]]\parents."
* "I want to [an hero], doubles decides my method."
* "Roll doubles and tell me to do anything and I will do it, timestamped."
* "Defuse teh bomb[[oneone|!!1]]"
* "Her face when I rolled doubles"

==Variations==

* Trips
* Quads
* Random number (e.g. 69, 91)
* Double doubles, Trips or Quads. (yes it exists)

==Death of Doubles and Triples==

<s>As of February 20, 2010, [[m00t]] killed doubles, adding [[post ending in xxx|XXX to the end of each post number]] to prevent more [[the cancer that is killing /b/|cancer]]. The 200m [[get]] saw the permanent implementation of the XXX system. The last three digits can be seen using this script.[http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/69598], or this one [http://www.toolsofthe.net/downloads.php] (both require greasemonkey)</s>. Nigger, shut up and check mah dubz!
{{clear}}

As of February 21, 2010 it doesn't matter, anon's just using the <strike>randomly generated filename</strike> [[Unix]] time, numbers for their epic doubles and triples. Oh, but Unix time is easily predictable... so it is kinda stupid. Just like  the original thing.

==Naming and Shaming==

==Doubles, Episode 2: Attack Of The Doubles==

On Monday, January 17, 2011 (Martin Luther King Jr. Day), the XXX was pulled from all boards it was set on allowing the doubles trolololol to once again flow unhindered. However, most doubles trolls had died out by this time or were using a script leaving almost no one to care/notice that XXX had been removed.
