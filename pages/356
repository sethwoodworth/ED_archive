Some time ago, a [[Russian]] [[Livejournal]] user by the name '''trackeri''' posted some juicy <s>[http://trackeri.livejournal.com/15272.html dox]</s> ([[baleeted]]) on a Ukrainian student named [[Aliza Shvarts|Alisa Kuzmenko]], who had the best hobby ever - [[AZN|finding dead dogs and skinning them in her kitchen]] for the [[lulz]] - and, of course, taking pics for posterity.  There was also a couple of videos made, [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|but they're gone now]].

Needless to say, [[over 9000]] angry Russians put their [[drunk|vodka]] and [[wimmin|women beating]] aside to troll Alisa and to show their heartfelt [[furry|love for dead dogs everywhere]].

Her info was almost as lulzworthy as the pics themselves:<br />
*'''Name''': Alisa Kuzmenko <br />
*"I'm on the second year of the international relations college in Kiev, studying international business."<br />
*'''Main online nickname''': lir_fon_tamiir<br />
*'''DOB''': [[Jailbait|1990-08-xx]]<br />
*'''City''': Kiev, Ukraine<br />
*'''Telephone''': +380 xxx-xx-xx<br />
*'''About me''': [[wut|I'm Alice! And that's all I can say!]]<br />
*'''Interests''': [[Final Fantasy 6|Kafka]], [[black metal]], darkwave, [[Irish]] dance, piercing, [[cock|turtles]].<br />

Her partner in crime's dox were also published by trackeri:<br />
*'''Name''': Anna Donchuk<br />
*[[16 year old girl|18 years old]]<br />
*Studying [[bestiality|veterinary science]] in the Agricultural College of Ukraine<br />

==The Cumdumpsters Speakout==

The girls made a statement after the comments started pouring in:

|I don't deny that it is us on the photos. Here goes... She started the second year of her university. All students had to prepare a dead bone and bring it to class. Many bought a prepared cow bone in a store, but Anya has principles, she wanted to find something... We were hoping to get a dead rotten rat at the most, but got lucky - we found a dog (still living) that's just been hit by a car. Well, we picked it up, worked on it and got a fucking awesome skeleton. As for the funny photos - there is exactly the same amount of them as technical photos! And after all, why not laugh, the animal is dead, it doesn't care. Did I answer all of your questions?
|Actually, no, can I [[Stick_It_In_Her_Pooper|stick it in your pooper?]]
|We cannot open a case, because the dog was already dead - says assistant director to Kiev's metropolitan police, Vladimir Dmitrenko. - However, there is still the crime of cruelty to animals to consider. However, we don't have any material evidence to conclusively persecute them for what they did.

After [[Fap|watching through the video several times]], a local newspaper published an article on the matter, citing that the Agricultural College did not give the girls any assignments, and that they indeed [[lulz|did it for the lulz]]. They also say that the video shows them sticking candles into the dog's eviscerated carcass and blowing them out, like on a birthday cake. 
Good times were had by all.

==The videos==

Both girls appeared on a Russian program defending their actions and showing clips of the birthday cake dog.
Caution, massive amounts of [[moonspeak]] ahead.
