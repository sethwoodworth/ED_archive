==The REAL Article==

Aside from being a [[butthurt]] [[emo]]/[[indie]] [[Jewish]] [[Wop]] [[grammar nazi]] with [[OCD]] and [[Asperger's]] (all of the above are true, btw), '''Jude's Army''' is perhaps one of the biggest [[fail]]ures to [[Eelgirl|come out of]] [[MySpace]]. Jude's Army was an [[internet humanitarian]] who worked with [[faggot]]s liek [[Mission: MySpace]] to harm [[pedo|innocent]] MySpace users and kill their profiles. She had a [[fetish]] for reporting [[troll]]s because she haets the [[lulz]]. After having been in an internet [[drama|love quadrangle]] which almost caused one [[retard|dude]] to become [[an hero]], it was brought to light that Jude's Army was not in fact the [[hawt|hot]] [[bitch]] in her photos. Unfortunately, she has refused to leave MySpace, and continues [[Lurker|lurking]] on it like the [[basement-dweller]] she is.

=="Alyssa"==

Before having been found out as a [[shemale|fake]], Jude's Army went by the name Alyssa. She used the name "Jude's Army" for some of her top sekrit groups and forums. She stole pictures from a [[16-year-old girl]] named Albany who lives in [[England]] and claimed to be 21. Strangely enough, the [[jailbait]] Jude's Army stole the pictures from actually looked 21. All the [[sick fuck|guys]] she worked with on her pedo-busting activities who [[fap]]ped to her pictures are guilty of being pedos themselves, since they fapped to pictures of that [[jailbait]]. Jude's Army, however, tried not to laugh at them and continued with her troll-reporting [[bullshit]].

==MySpace Vigilantes==

Jude's Army moderated a group called MySpace Vigilantes, or MSV. Once [[troll]]s found out about this group, they tried to [[raep]] it [[for great justice]], but ended up getting [[murder|kill]]ed because Jude's Army [[fellatio|sucked]] [[Tom Anderson]]'s [[cock]], and MySpace deleted all the righteous lulzbringers. The group used to be private, but is now public. Needless to say, it has  been dominated by trolls. Jude's Army has recently logged in, though she has not done anything, and the group sits there, abandoned.

==Chip==

Jude's Army's greatest accomplishment is a pedo-busting operation she carried out with other members of MySpace Vigilantes. They made two profiles of [[loli|teen girls]] and were able to ensnare an [[retard|unsuspecting pedo]] named Chip.

Chip made a [[lol-cow|lulzcow]] of himself and ended up losing his job, but because Jude's Army was a phony, the evidence could not be taken to court without her [[fat|true identity]] being revealed.

This operation was only one of many that MSV carried out; another known one was known as "Operation [[Urine|YellowCake]]", where one of the other team members [[fail]]ed to successfully bust the pedo, though evidence was gathered.

==The Love Quadrangle==

Can you say [[IRL]] [[soap opera]]? Jude's Army fell in [[love]] with three [[nerd]]s [[OL]] simultaneously, and ended up at the point of meeting all three IRL. However, since she was pretending to be [[hawt|someone else]], she couldn't really meet any of them. One had even planned to propose to her when they met. When the truth about the situation came to light (only weeks before Jude's Army was outed as a fake), the guy almost became [[an hero|an hero to us all]] over some [[shit nobody cares about]] like [[hai2u|a relationship]]. Jude's Army confessed in her blog about the love quadrangle.

That's just the beginning. One of Jude's Army's boyfriends, LoLo, arranged a flight to New York to meet Jude's Army IRL. However, Jude's Army had given him a fake address, resulting in a five-day wild goose chase for LoLo, nights of [[BAWWW]]ing and LoLo's [[nerd rage|heartfelt confessions of love for Miss Alghero]], and in the end, [[lulz|HE NEVER SAW JUDE'S ARMY]]. Jude's Army was exposed shortly thereafter by LoLo as an imposter.

Here is a transcript of an online conversation Jude's Army had with one of her e-boyfriends after he found out [[whore|what was really going on]].

==What is Known About the Real Jude's Army==

All that is currently known about the real Jude's Army is that she is an 18-year-old [[Wop|Italian-American]] female [[basement-dweller]] named Alyssa Alghero. She does live in New York, though her address is unknown. She is a Jew and was in [[NYC]] on [[9/11]], making her a [[JEWS DID WTC|prime suspect in the 9/11 terrorist attacks]]. It is also highly suspected that she is a [[furry]].
