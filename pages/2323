Dogster
Dogster was a [[Flash]] 'animator' that had a tiny and hated career in /f/ starting from Fall in 2005. His abortions were loops of [[azns]] doing something zany with some random chiptune music in the background, each lovingly titled WTF Moments. He also put his obnoxious watermark '''BY DOGSTER''' on each one which didn't help the recent Geovid explosion that year. He has since listened to the general population and got the fuck out, which should serve as a cautionary tale for anyone attempting to appeal with loops of your favorite [[Newgrounds]] .gif of the day
