Mediacrat Voicemails
A series of two voicemails received from [[Mediacrat]] by [[Jameth]] while the former was on his psychotic manhunt for [[Andrewpants]] in San Francisco at the height of the Mediacrat fiasco.  (For full details, please see the [[Mediacrat]] entry.)  [[Jameth]] posted the voicemails to the [[Internets]], and thus many of the most famous [[Mediacrat]] [[catchphrase]]s were born.

===Voicemail the First===
{{audio|voicemail1.ogg|First voicemail (.OGG)}} {{audio|Voicemail1.mp3|(.MP3)}}

''Hello James, this is Joshua Williams, or that is my formal legal name.  I'm calling to inform you that I do, um, intend to file a restraining order against you, and I do intend to extract [[Andrewpants|Andrew]]'s personal information from you, which I demand at least by eight p.m. today in my, um, at my [[Yahoo]] address (just so you know, you can't email my academic one).  It's H-E-Y-Y-S-H-W-A-H at Yahoo dot com.'' 

''What I'm expecting from [[PowerWord: IRL Name|you, James]], is every bit of information you know about Andrew, and if I don't get that, you'll be speaking with the, with a police officer by eight-ten.''

''Also, I would appreciate any pictures that you, that you have of incriminating evidence, and if you don't comply with this information, you '''will''' be speaking to an attorney, and you '''will''' be subpoenaed, and you '''will''' give depositions, and you '''will''' be completely drained of your [[masturbation|personal time]], and you '''will''' be defending yourself from me, because not only did you [[defamation|slander]] me in [[LiveJournal]], you also perpetuated hurtful information of myself, you also changed the words I said, you also impersonated me by making a [[internet disease|fake icon]], you also made up [[slashfic|stories]] about me, and you also got about a hundred and fifty people in on the deal.''

''So what I expect from  you, James (Last name), is your reply with, with everything I've demanded, or you will be hearing from a lawyer, and you will be ... a [[yiff|suit will come against you]], and you're not immune to this stuff.  You might think it's [[drama]]tic, you might think it's [[funny]], but this is [[The Internet Is Serious Business|serious business]], and you are in trouble if you don't answer me, ok?''

''Eight p.m., HEY-SCHWAH (double Y), ot'' (sic) ''Yahoo dot com, with every inf--with every piece of information you can get from Andrew.  I'm talking about address, phone number, where he goes to school, what he does for work, '''EVERY. THING. JAMES'''!''

''Goodbye.''

===Voicemail the Second===
{{audio|voicemail2.ogg|Second voicemail (.OGG)}} {{audio|Voicemail2.mp3|(.MP3)}}

''Hi James, uh, hold on.''

(to cabbie) ''Can you take me to the nicest restaurant with a view ... ah, I want a view of the Golden Gate Bridge and a fine bottle of wine.  Can you do that?  What do you say?  Where should we go?  Where sho...do y...do you have a recommendation?'' <!---I think he says "Scala's" here, but that's not that near the bay, it's on Union Square.  Help is appreciated.}--->  ''Where's that?  Ok, let's do it.  Perfect.''

''So James, I want to tell you, you are now named in my [[Internet lawsuit|lawsuit]] because you would not cooperate, and um, I tried to warn you very much so, and let me just tell you that you are in as much trouble now as Andrew, and I really tried to be your [[friend]], and I really tried to be honest with you, but, um, you [[defamation|defamed]] me and you [[harassment|harassed]] me, and I have an, uh, as you know, an [[unlimited disposable income]], and I will have the best [[Internet lawyer|attorneys]], and [[I will have your humility]], because you were wrong, and you were mean to me, and you will now pay those consequences.''

''This is my final contact with you, James.  The next, the next communication will come from a lawyer, the last thing that you've, you'll ever mention about me in your [[journal]] is that you're being, you're being officially sued by me, or nothing at all.  If you see me in a bar, you'd better not talk to me,  you'd better hide, because I will go up to you and I'll humiliate you.  And I'll tell everybody what you've done to me, and how sick and demented you are, with helping Andrew along with this, and just how perverted you are.''

''This isn't drama&mdash;this is my [[IRL|life]].  And you've ruined my life.  But the good part of it is, James, I have a brand new life.  And I'm rich.  And I'm beautiful.  And I have the perfect friends, and I have a perfect everything, and I know you do, too, so this really means nothing to you, but just so you know, you haven't won, I've won.  Andrew and you and your little posse have inspired me, and given me the confidence through your obsession with me that I might be a model, and that I could be a model.''

''And so, in effect, [[:Image:check.jpg|thank you for the ten thousand dollars the you've already contributed]], and I will be seeking damages from you, and so I'll be thanking you for money in the future.''

''My final words to you, James, are: I did the best I could to be a friend to you, and I did the best I could to be honest and helpful, and to be supportive of you, and I never got involved with your drama, and so what you will now do is learn the lesson that a friend is a true friend when they will just be your friend.''

''Goodbye.''
