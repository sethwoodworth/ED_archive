'''Comic-Con''' is the world's largest convention of [[furry|furries]], [[you|virgins]], and various breeds of [[basement dwellers]]. Every year, [[losers|collectors]] of all [[fat|shapes]] and [[fat|sizes]] herd together and migrate to some poor unsuspecting city that probably is [[asking for it]], cum buckets over [[shit nobody cares about]], and leave the city smelling of desperation and musty fursuits.

It took [[Seattle]] 6 months to wash all the excess [[fail]] it had picked up into Puget Sound after the [[9/11|2007]] event. This created a 3 mile wide oil slick that was later determined to be [[Buttsecks|Astroglide]] and synthetic fur.

==Comics==
With the convention being called comic-con you'd figure it would be all about comics but the only real shit to do with comics anymore is the hordes of [[Wapanese|weeaboos]] and [[13-year-old boy|13-year olds]] that took over the convention gathering around to suck Stan Lee's cock even though none of them has read a single one of his comics. They all probably [[Facepalm|tell him how great batman was]]. There probably still is like 3 booths about comics but they've been mostly [[Masturbation|beaten out]] by all the [[Sephiroth|Sephiroth]] strip shows.

==[[YouTube|JewTube]] Cluster-fuck==
One of the more popular events of comic-con is the various  [[Internet celebrity|"celebrities"]] from YouTube [[Circle jerk|dicking around together]] on the convention floor which includes but is not limited to: [[Fail|Failing]] to Troll, failing to be funny, and failing to be intelligent or knowledgeable. You can usually find people like [[Sxephil|Philip De Franco]] and his group of retarded talentless fuck-buddies engaging in their [[Gay sex|regular activities]] such as pretending to be [[No one likes you|famous or important]]

==[[Cosplay|Cosplayers]]==
[[Some argue|Perhaps]] the most fail aspect of comic-con is the amazing amount [[faggot]] weeaboo cosplayers there are. These people actually think they're cool because they dress up as their favorite [[animu|animu]] character and [[rape|harass]] people. You can <s>expect to</s> will see costumes of anything from star wars, final fantasy, obscure indie shows/movies/games, final fantasy, anime , [[Halo|popular video games]],sometimes though rarely '''Comic-books''',  or even final fantasy. It is a good idea to keep your [[buttsecks|ass covered]] around these guys. 

Every once in a while you might see some one with a really cool, well made costume, maybe even from something you like. If you do remember, just because their costume is cool doesn't mean they are, if they spent the time to make a good costume it is very likely that they are [[You| obsessive no-life faggots]] and approaching them could have [[rape|dire consequences]].

== [[TITS OR GTFO|Women]] ==
While cosplaying is indeed the most fail part of Comic-con, it also happens to be the one thing about that is amazing. Why? Well because women are paid to [[Epic win|dress like slutty vidya game and animu characters]]. It's like [[Awesome| Halloween but all the women are herded into a single building]]. It's true their is a pretty good amount of [[Man The Harpoons|fattasses]] but at least the [[Hottie32|epic fatasses]] can't fit through the doors to enter the convention and eventually give up and [[Gb2|return]] to their kitchens.

As for these hot girls, aside from bringing much win to the convention through their hotness they also contribute something else very important. Without them the convention would smell [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100]] times worse. You see the Nerd is a lazy thing and when he knows he will only be around his fellow nerds he can feel assured that they will accept him and his smell, no matter how horrendous, so why shower? When the women came into the equation everything changed. These [[sarcasm|genius]] men feel that if they shower and groom themselves they can get into the pants of one of the [[Unrealistic Expectations|Double-D skinny chick dressed as Tifa]] that now attend the convention. This of course never happens, [[evar|evar]], but is still a pleasure to those who still have properly working [[Jews|noses]]. Their hotness also attracts a [[over 9000|certain level]] of douche-baggery from the male gender as to be expected from any area populated by half naked hot chicks, but unless you're gay it's totally worth it.

See [[Jessica Nigri]] to see what we mean.

== Vidya Games==
Because video games obviously don't have their [http://www.e3expo.com/| own] [http://www.paxsite.com/| conventions] gaming companies choose to reveal much of the [[Shit nobody cares about|information on their upcoming games and products]] at comic-con. If you thought it wasn't bad enough with all the weeaboos, basement dwellers, and <s>Comic book</s> movie fans, now there's [[Gamer|hardcore gamers]]. This pretty well represents the total rape of a convention based around comics to be about [[sell out|whatever people with money feel it's about]]
