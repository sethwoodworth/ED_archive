Oil

A popular [[Wikipedia]] topic that is particularly loathsome.  Some [[pedophile|Wikipedians]] spend more time arguing about oil than they do about whether it is morally acceptable to kidnap and rape small boys for [[lulz| giggles]].

Lately, there has been some fear that we may run out of oil.  This would interfere with the political agenda of fags and possibly pedos by clamming up the dry hole for all eternity, as well as destroying the [[lube]] industry forever.

==Running out of oil==

People who edit [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] have time to do so because they do not need to hunt and gather in small tribes or live in Arab.  They appear very rich, but that's just because they're burning our ancestors, who have become a tasty brand of oil known as petroleum.

OMG J/K.  It might be lulz-worthy to troll guys who run websites like http://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net/, if only the whole "running out of oil" meme didn't get pwnt all the time in the [[old media|media]].  There's nothing to worry about, kiddies, keep doing your thing and everything is going to be [[pedophile|ok]].

Many geologists believe that we may be able to end our dependence on oil by harvesting [[basement dwellers]] for their oily skin.  This oil is particularly disgusting, and may cause acne, virginity, and a tendency to play [[D&D]]. But we will never run out of oil since Ronald Reagan and Jesus fill the Earth up every several thousand miles.

==Ethnic Cleansing==

Oil burns at a high temperature.  Furries and protesting azn monks are easily [[pwnt]] with burning oil.  However, oil does not burn hot enough to kill [[jews]].  For that purpose, special ovens are required.

You can use your lust for oil to justify killing [[muslims|sand niggers]].  See [[W]].

==Future Energy Sources==

[[Obese|Land Whales]] - America has vast untapped oil deposits trapped in the bodies of these creatures.  An eco-friendly approach to the extraction of this natural resource could come in the form of solar powered rendering plants.  One would simply need to insert the ambulatory oil depots into the center of a parabolic dish and allow clean, all-natural solar heat to drive the process.  The oil that runs off would go to proudly power our energy-hungry [[Suburbs|hummering burbilicious crowds]].  The nostalgia invoked by returning to whale oil strikes a deep chord within us all as well.  One day people will say that it wasn't an obesity crisis, it was an obesity ''opportunity''.
