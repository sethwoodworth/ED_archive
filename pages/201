Abstinence

'''Abstinence''' refers to the position of [[Insanity|voluntarily refraining]] from [[sex]]. Most people who are abstinent do so due to [[Fundamentalist|religious reasons]], a desire to save their [[virginity]] for their spouse or "the right person" or simply because they're are too fucking paranoid, wussy/[[ugly]]/[[dumb]] to get any. Or some combination of the above.

This should not be confused with being a [[technical virgin]], since those who are abstinent refrain from all forms of intercourse, including [[buttsex]]. & yes, there are [[men]] who are abstinent.

== Abstinence-only Sex Education ==
In recent years, the focus of secondary [[school]] sex education is has shifted from application (i.e. [[condom]] use, positions) to abstinence-only. The [[jews|higher-ups]] insist that this is to keep kids safe, but everyone knows that it's really an elaborate scheme to turn as many of them into [[neoconservative]] pseudo-[[Christians]] as possible.

=== Chastity Rings ===
[[Image:Purity ring.JPG|thumb|left|The last thing you want to see on a girl's finger]]

'''Chastity Rings''' (also known as '''Purity Rings''') are wedding rings you wear before you get [[married]] - the person who wears one commits to staying with a partner whom they never have [[sex]] with. They are commonly worn as compensation for [[fact|the realization that no one is really interested in doing them anytime soon]].

==== Who Buys Them?====
===== Females =====
====== [[12 year old girls]] ======

With their [[Intellectual insufficiency|limited mental capacities]], young girls are easily brainwashed into following the [[Jonas Brothers]], who also wear these rings (see [[faggots]]). A subsequent contest is found in the later teen years, dressing as preppy bubble-gum teenie boppers pulling slutty poses/clothes, seeing how much of a [[cocktease]] they can be without actually getting involved in a relationship other than [[Jesus]].

===== Males: Wait, [[What]]? =====
[[Image:Goatse ring.gif|thumb|left|[[Homos]] can have chastity rings too.]]

====== [[Faggots]] ======

Unable to cope with the fact they enjoy having [[sausage]] pumped into their assholes, some men like to pretend they chose not to have sex with [[women]] because of their [[bullshit|religious beliefs]] and not because they're the ones who would be wearing the wedding dress in [[Massachusetts]]. Real men realise that even though [[vaginas]] are scary, they can still be tamed while the girls is still [[12 year old girls|12 years old]] - which coincidentally is the same age most girls want to buy chastity rings.

====== [[Asexuals]] ======

Like being [[gay]], everyone knows that being asexual is not a choice - try though they might, nobody is willing to fuck them. In order to deluded themselves into thinking they are not [[ugly]], empty, lonely creatures they also claim to chose putting off [[sex]], possibly until death.

====== [[Castration|Castrati]] ======

If you don't have the [[cock|junk]], you can't hit that [[booty|badunkadunk]]. Simple as that.

=== Chastity Devices ===

Some sexual deviants get off on having their genitals under lock and key, with someone else holding the key. Of course, they rarely find someone else for that job because they're just too creepy in the first place. If your [[husband]] tries to get you to participate in such a fantasy divorce him, otherwise he'll next convince you to [[cuckold|sleep with some black dude]] and then bring a [[creampie]] back home for him to eat. Of course, he'll chicken out and you'll just get [[AIDS]], you dirty [[whore]].

Of the women who enjoy wearing a chastity belt we may consider none, or at least very few of them, as sexual deviants. They actually have the right idea.

=== [[Christians]] ===
[[Circumcise#Female_Circumcision|Short of snipping the bitch's clit off]] a pretty ring isn't going to stop [[your mom|some women]] breeding like cockroaches. [[Abortion]] is not only simpler but [[funny|funnier]] as once she's been scraped often enough she'll become sterile anyway.

=== [[WWJD]]? ===
The most common excuse people have for abstinence is that it makes Jesus [[happy]]. For most, those stupid purity rings are a way to show that one has made a promise to themselves and to [[God]] to stay "pure" until [[marriage]]. 

As far as these people are concerned, [[Fucking|fornication]] is a 1-way ticket to eternal damnation to the smoltering embers of [[Hell]] along with daily [[sodomy]] by the massive barbed [[shlong]] of [[Satan]]. [[PTSD|Sucks to be them.]] 

===Everyone Else===

Of all the terrible things [[16 year old girls|teenaged bimbos]] get up to - contracting [[STD]]s, [[camwhore|flashing their tits on 4chan]], getting [[pregnant]] etc. - taking a vow not to have sex until they're married has caused the most outrage among parents, because it is the right of every cum-beltching gutter whore to down as many cocks as possible before she becomes [[too old]] to be of any interest.

[[Some argue]] that [[condoms]] are better at preventing [[pregnancy]] than Chastity rings, overlooking the fact that [[14/f/Cali|14 year old girls from California]] should not be hooking up with [[pedophile|men who enjoy girls under a certain age]] in the first place.

You can troll the deviants who participate in enforced chastity by visiting [[forum]]s like [http://chastitymansion.com/ Chastity Mansion] and making up some story about how you regret introducing the [[fetish]] to your [[wife]] and are now contemplating [[suicide]].

== The Only Sure Form of Contraception? ==

In spite of what abstinence-only [[douchebag]]s claim, abstinence does not decrease the likelihood of [[pregnancy]] - not if you sleep next to your partner in the same bed every night. [[Seriously]] - it is a [[true|well-known]] [[fact]] among legitimate sex educators that abstinence has a significantly higher [[failure]] rate as a [[birth control]] method than [[condom]]s or the pill. Brutal [[irony]].
