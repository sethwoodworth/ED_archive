[20:50] <hep> plz advz
[20:50] <Blargh> IT'S PART OF A ZIONIST CONSPIRACY
[20:50] <Crossmack> it has nothing to do with religion
[20:50] <hep> which language barrier?
[20:50] <Culexor> Romantic: WTC woopdee-fucking doo
[20:50] <hep> perhaps you wish to speak another language?

[20:50] <Crossmack> english/arabic
[20:50] <Blargh> OSAMA IS INNOCENT YOU FUCKING KIKE

[20:51] <red5> crossmack you are a duche
[20:52] <Blargh> and war is fucking awesome
[20:52] <Blargh> it makes for great movies
[20:52] <TiCL> Crossmack: do you smoke dong?
[20:52] <Crossmack> War is the result in a breakdown in communication
[20:52] <Blargh> unless it's a zionist war
[20:52] <Barrett> zomg
[20:52] <Crossmack> rather a result "of" a breakdown
[20:52] <hep> um
[20:52] <Barrett> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Q64e0xX9g
[20:52] <hep> not really
[20:52] <Crossmack> you don't think?
[20:52] <Romantic> Crossmack, why would having a unifying language stop war? Isn't war the disagreement of ideas, ideals, and religion the cause of war? Not to mention profit? 
[20:52] <Blargh> you stupid kike, there will always be war
[20:52] <Blargh> you stupid kike, there will always be war
[20:52] <Blargh> you stupid kike, there will always be war
[20:52] <hep> war is caused by the drive of certain humans to dominate other humans
[20:52] <red5> the americans fought the british speaking the same language all the time
[20:52] <hep> usually war is economybased these days
[20:52] <Culexor> WTC woopdee-fucking doo
[20:52] <Crossmack> I think war is the inability to reconcile differences
[20:52] <Blargh> unless we are all brain-controlled we will have war
[20:52] <hep> wrong
[20:52] <Blargh> so take your pick
[20:52] <hep> war is about control
[20:53] <Culexor> war is the woopdee-fucking doo
[20:53] <v0dka> [22:52:31] <Crossmack> I think war is the inability to reconcile differences]
[20:53] <Romantic> Crossmack; or about control/money.
[20:53] <v0dka> [22:52:31] <Crossmack> I think war is the inability to reconcile differences]
[20:53] <v0dka> THAT IS CORRECT
[20:53] <Blargh> we keep our humanity but lose peace
[20:53] <Romantic> Which is not about langauge.
[20:53] <Crossmack> but even still, the US will never go to war with Britain, Canada, Austrailia
[20:53] <PuppyPuncher> Yes Barret, that is very hillarious

<Blargh> do you support israel
<Crossmack> so this 8 year relationship with Amanda has helped a great deal
<Crossmack> I think the state of Israel should not be where it is
<Crossmack> it's causing too much tension
<Blargh> but would you say that you would not approve the murder of six million jews?
<Blargh> *of
<Crossmack> I don't approve of Hitler's actions
<Crossmack> that was the result of allowing a man extreme influence
<Blargh> hitler was pro-environment
<Crossmack> but he isolated himself and became psychotic
<Crossmack> he did not see the destructiveness in what he was doing
<Blargh> it wasn't destructive
<Blargh> he was making the world better
<Crossmack> it was destructive to humanity
<Blargh> only to the inferior races
<Crossmack> however you perceive it
<Blargh> which deserve to be destroyed anyways
<Crossmack> no one deserves anything
<Blargh> yes, jews deserve a painful death for the suffering they have caused
<Crossmack> no one deserves anything.  Humans are insignificant and undeserving
<Crossmack> we must forge our own existance
<Blargh> existence
<Blargh> so you are a transhumanist?
<Crossmack> aye
<Crossmack> what is that?
<Crossmack> like seeing that all people are the same?
<Blargh> someone who believes that mankind should strive to become a designed being, like a cyborg
<Crossmack> I think that is already happening.  I think it is inevitable
<Blargh> you fucking mechanophile
<Crossmack> Don't you think it is happening?
<Blargh> when the robot wars come, i will destroy you
<Crossmack> There will not be any robot wars
<Blargh> robots may be smarter, but they cannot understand LOVE
<Crossmack> The consciousness will always take presidence
<Blargh> you don't even know what you are talking about fag
<Crossmack> I'm talking about implants
<Crossmack> about logging into the internet with our minds
<Crossmack> it is going to happen dude
<Crossmack> already people can control machines with their eyes
<Blargh> that's just the first step towards the robopocalypse
<Blargh> you just go ahead and embrace the destruction of whatever humanity you have left
<Crossmack> you think we would do better to avoid technology?
<Blargh> i will be waiting for you with a rocket launcher
<Crossmack> why are you avoiding my question
<Blargh> i will fire at the sight of your infra-red eyes
<Crossmack> lol
<Crossmack> I am not planning on becoming a cyborg dude
<Crossmack> Humanity is so scattered and confused right now
<Crossmack> it seems like the internet is our way of coming together
<Blargh> get in main chan and affirm that we had this chat
<Blargh> continue discussion in chan
<Crossmack> I"m in ED
<Crossmack> oh i got booted
<Blargh> do machines turn you on
<Blargh> i bet they do, you technophile
<Crossmack> just existentially
