Tumblr
{{quote|Tumblr was originally the good-natured domain of [[hipsters|hip New York creatives]]. It was, on balance, a creative force on the Internet. But the role it played in trolling [[Jessi Slaughter]] shows that Tumblr is developing a nasty side as well.

[[Image:Tumblrtiktok.png|thumb|Accurate parody of tumblr]]

'''Tumblr''' is a popular website that preaches the concept of needlessly minimizing the vowels in words, and it was created, perhaps, for [[blogging]]. While its original purpose has long since been forgotten, its present application is apparent: to provide a [[circlejerk]] space for every [[hipster|hipstr]], [[16 year old girl|16 year old grl]], and [[Indie]] [[artfag|artfg]] to post their favorite stolen photographs and pieces of [[DeviantART|mediocre art]], [[Trying too hard|"meaningful"]] subtitled stills from pretentious popular films, as well as [[wolfaboo|talking about how cool wolves]] are. In short, Tumblr consists of boring and vulnerable, boy crazy high school girls that wish they were someone else and the [[Pussy|sensitive]] guys who ultimately win them over by posting desaturated Polaroids of their meticulously decorated bedrooms.

Tumblr's population consists solely of only the [[Annoying|coolest]] and most [[Poser|trendy]] [[Fags|kids]] in your nearest suburb or recently gentrified urban avenue, as well as talented [[camwhore|photographers]], [[McDonalds|poets]] and [[Burger King|writers]]. If the Internet had property for its users to virtually [[Habbo Hotel|dwell]] in, Tumblr would be the gentrified neighborhood full of studio apartments, paid for by [[mom]] and [[dad]]. Tumblr users probably want to go to [[art school]] to study [[Homosexuality|painting]], and likely will get in with enough [[Parents|hard work]]. But, alas, they are likely to drop out after discovering that reposting images on the Internet didn't magically give them talent. 

Tumblr is also filled with [[newfags]] who steal [[memes]], mostly wolf-related [[cancer]] [[shit]] such as [[Courage Wolf]] and [[Advice_Dog/Variations#Insanity_Wolf|Insanity Wolf]].

== Concept ==
[[Image:TypicalTumblr8.jpg|thumb|[[Cry moar]]]]
Tumblr is based around effortlessly sharing anything, no matter how pointless, annoying or similar it is. Tumblr doesn't take into account that the data you're [[Stealing|posting]] may [[Plagiarism|belong to someone else]], so its users are free to take and repost another person's work with ease, most often [[Copyright Infringement|without citing any source or author]] without punishment. However, since the website is run by a Jew, those little technicalities are panned over. 

Tumblr allows its users to [[Stalk|Follow]] other users, which places their posts on their dashboard. The more users and Followers that "[[like]]" and repost your [[bullshit]] posts, the higher your "Tumblarity" will become. With Tumblarity, Tumblr essentially becomes the [[high school]] of the Internet; people with the highest Tumblarity are rewarded with their blogs being named the most popular. Thus, the blog becomes not so much about blogging at all, but about how much people "like" the "cool" stuff you post - a popularity contest. The original concept of blogging in general is more or less lost when users become [[Deleting your LiveJournal|disillusioned]] from the original purpose of their blogging, and become more concerned with the number of people who "like" the beige picture of someone's feet that they posted.

== History ==
[[Image:David-karp.jpg|thumb|David Karp, the creator of Tumblr, and his MacBook. Big fucking surprise.]]

Tumblr was created in 2007 by an obvious Jew named David Karp, initially funded by his earnings as a [[Pedophile|software consultant]] for a [[CP|parenting website]]. After cajoling his userbase into throwing away their money into his wallet (AKA: fundraising), he had over $5 million dollars to help fund his website dedicated to hosting 200kb, low contrast pictures of anonymous people's belly buttons. To get an idea of the man Karp is, note that he gladly revoked the name of a random user and handed it over to Pitchfork media arguably for [[indie]] cred.

His own Tumblr, found [http://www.davidslog.com/ here], hosts not only his massive [[Ego|popularity]], but also [[Shit nobody cares about|randoms instances from his every day life]], [[Unwarranted_self-importance|for all of his fans to read daily]]. 

[[Image:DavidKarpPodium.jpg|thumb|All hail the hipster.]]
A few examples of the former would be the follow:
{{quote|"Anonymous asked: Why are you so [[Gay|cute]] and [[Retarded|smart]]?

Jew."}}

{{quote|
“I think it’s funny. But I think all your [[Advice Dog|jokes]] people [[Unfunny|misinterpret]] are funny.”

{{quote|[[WTF|will everyone on my dash quit posting pics of david saying “daddy’s gonna protect us?!” as amusing as it is (and totally true, david karp can do anything, we are safe as long as he is here) but i have sexual fantasies about this man, y’all are making it awkward!!!]]|-typical tumblr user}}

== The Users ==
[[File:Dera.jpg|thumb|left|Every tumblr user EVAR. ]]
[[File:Tumblrthinksits4chan.png|thumb|right|Tumblr [[newfags]] steal unfunny memes]]
The average tumblr user is a [[white]], well liked, pretty cool person to hang out with [[IRL]] however once they start tumblogging they become a douche bag [[hipster]] that [[Victim complex|whines]]about having no cool friends, no supporting family members and [[Forever Alone|no love life]] because it's t3h K00l3st!

The usual thing you'll see from a tumblr user is the post "Ask Me Something via My ask Box". DON'T FALL FOR IT! 'cause let's be honest here, if people didn't want to talk to your lame ass before, what makes you think they're going to want to talk to you after you've begged for their attention. If you do ever fall for it make sure they have 'anonymous' turned on so that you can tell them something [[Lulz|mean]]. They'll most likely respond with sarcasm or with [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|I'm too cool for this shit]] which forces their [[Fantard|followers]] to get all [[butthurt|butt hurt]] and flood them with "Don't listen to that anon you're awesome and I want to eat your shit".

About 99.8% of the time someone follows another person without liking any of their post they're doing so just for a follow back. Following the follower back only solidifies how much of a loser the followed one is (probably because they want to hold on to the idea that someone actually cares about the lame shit that they post). 0.1% of the time that someone follows another is because the follower thinks the followed is [[Hott|cute]] and wants to fap to the followed's GPOY's. the other 0.1% is actually someone who cares and they're usually a friend [[IRL]] or a family member. 

Tumblr users HATE when their friends follow them. Mainly because all they ever do is rage and bitch about people they know IRL which might eventually destroy friendships or relationships and expose how horribly shallow and callus the tumblr user really is. Tumblr users HATE [[Facebook]] and view themselves to be superior to anyone on Facebook.

=== Ugly [[Hipster]] -wannabe [[16 year old girls]]===

[[Image:Tumblrpromwhores.png ‎|thumb|right|Having no friends [[irl]] means desperate measures]]

[[Image:Desperatetumblrwhores.png]]

If it hasn't been obvious, then this should be stated: Tumblr is overflowing with desperate [[16 year old girl]]s who are [[hipster]]s in training and [[attention whore]]s.

===[[Azn|Asians]]===
Herds of Asian have been swarming Tumblr. Their blogs (typically titled with doublee letterss and an [[unwarrented self importance|obnoxious phrase about themselves]]) consist of [[Shit|thought-inducing photoshopped pictures with unrelated quotes on them]], [[Camwhore|angled webcam pictures of themselves]] and [[You|other ugly Asian Tumblr users]], and [[butthurt|bawww posts about how much they hate their high expectations asian parents]]. Most of them are filled with [[Azn|azn pridee(:]] but everyone knows they're really a bunch of wannabe-black assfucks. Every now and then, they'll post about a recent break-up, complete with a photo/video of their [[Fugly|fugly crying faces]]. Both male and female users do this, proving that they're all a bunch of [[Fag|fags]]. The asian guys pretend to be black person despite planning to become [[engineers]] after they graduate [[high school]]. The asian girls post about their favorite [[azn]] dramas, [[SHIT|obnoxious k-pop boy/girl bands]], pictures of desserts and bubble tea, and seemingly somehow still manage to get a 4.0 GPA despite the fact they can't form complete sentences and fail math. Both genders will have "Like a G6" by the Far East movement on [[autoplay]].

===People who are "Tumblr Famous"===
* [http://tumblrisforlulz.tumblr.com/ tumblrisforlulz] An [[asspie]] that steals shit off of 4chan and is too retarded to search the true meaning of [[LULZ]]
* [http://fuckyeahumad.tumblr.com/ fuckyeahumad] Another [[asspie]] that re-steals from [http://tumblrisforlulz.tumblr.com/ tumblrisforlulz]
* [http://mikmikmik.tumblr.com/ Milk milk milk] A faggot who attempts to be mysterious and scary but fails horrible. 
* [http://1morezombie.tumblr.com/ 1morezombie] is a tight ass, proclaimed [[zombie]] [[fag]] who is as original as a drunk guido at a Bar Mitzvah. He isn't fooling anyone; he says he's a zombie but has no pictures to prove it.
* [http://blackiesdead.tumblr.com/ blackiesdead] An [[Australian]] [[indie]] kid who posts movie screencaps.
* [http://stuffhipstershate.tumblr.com/ stuffhipstershate] is a tumblr blog ran by to [[ugly|gorgeous]] women who think making fun of hipsters makes them non hipsters. Instead it makes them look like two giant retards laughing in the back of a crowded school bus. Follow them if you're not a hipster.
* [http://facelessemotion.tumblr.com/ FacelessEmotion] is a pretentious, self-loathing fag.
* [http://heartisbreaking.tumblr.com/ heartisbreaking] A [[retard]] and [[fugly]] [[mexican]] who [[weeaboo|holds a deep love and respect for all Asian culture]]. Easy trollbait. Send an ask bashing Japan and she will flip a bitch on you.

===Tumblr Slang===
*GPOY: Gratuitous Picture Of Yourself. Often used on pictures that don't relate to whatever the fuck someone is getting at.
*Topless Tuesdays: [[Attention whore]]s trying to solve their daddy issues

==Tumblr's [[shit|content]]==

* '''Thinspo'''. Every [[16 year old girl]] is guaranteed to have [[at least 100]] pictures of skinny models wearing sundresses or half naked on her blog representing not only her [[indie]][[fashion]] love (she doesn't know shit about fashion; she just likes vintage filters) but also her desperate insecurity about her "average" looks. 

* '''Pictures of couples in luv 4 eva'''  Every teenager on tumblr will have pictures of indie/scene couples kissing or in a sweet compromising position to express their sensitivity and heartache. Expect the couple to have their faces covered or cut out and heavily photoshopped because they're ugly.

* '''Food''' Out of all things you can photoshop, food has got to be the most ridiculously meticulous and detailed. Hipsters will go ape shit for a cup of yogurt on a floral pattern cloth angled and shot with a Nikon/Canon then photoshopped and filtered with fake bokehs. You will even see it happening with fucking [[KFC]], just remember to to include a green background because it's "complimentary to the red". 40k a year art school and that's what they have to show for it.

* '''Harry Potter''' Tumblr is infested with teenagers who think themselves to be so special just because they dislike [[twilight]] and love [[Harry Potter]]. They claim to LOVE reading, but we all know that is a huge lie. The only things they HAVE read are Harry Potter and the responses to their reblogs. They claim to love books and constantly post fashion pics of indie girls reading books, but in reality they organize their bookshelf by color and size and only watched the movies because reading hurts for them.

* '''Quotes''' Get a picture of space or the stars, put a photoshop filter on it, some triangles, then use Helvetica and put some quote on it and wait for your [[over 9000]] followers

* '''Movies''' Every movie screencap on Tumblr is either Mean Girls, the Virgin Suicides, or Inception

* '''Newfag shit''' Tumblr loves the following memes: WHAT IS AIR? [[U MAD]]? (used incorrectly), [[Antoine Dodson]], FFFUUUU, [[Socially Awkward Penguin]]

==Tumblr & 4chan's /b/==
[[File:Tumblrfailbitch.jpg|thumb|A 16 year old girl trying way too hard.]]
It's been long known that tumblr rarely produces it's own original shit, so it isn't really a surprise when old rejected fail memes from [[/b/]] make it big on tumblr. The only problem is that tumblr users are incredibly egotistical and think they own everything that they see on their tumblr dashboard regardless of where it originally came from.

[[copypasta|If you post it,]] it immediately becomes part of [[fail|tumblr culture]], [[amiright]]?

4chan's /b/ really couldn't give a fuck where all it's shit memes went to, but unfortunately for the internet the thing /b/ hates most these days is cancerous [[newfags]]. Not only is tumblr the cancer that is killing the internet, [[retards|tumblrfags]] actually think they deserve praise for their fail raids on omegle and dull sense of [[copypasta|unoriginality]]. [[drama|The hatred brewing between these two communities could possible lead to a cyber war between tumbloggers and /b/tards that this side of the internet has ever seen!!!]] 

===[[newfag|Newfaggotry]] rampant among [[16 year old girls]]===
Tumblr as of recent is full of [[unwarranted self importance|idiots who suddenly feel like /b/ because they bitched about]] [[Jessi Slaughter]]. Interconnected with each other and suddenly believing themselves to be [[1337]] [[France|army]] capable of damage like [[Anonymous]], Tumblr's [[party van]] consists of being covered with stars/space/forest wallpaper, [[STFU|triangles]], running on [[weed]] and [[love]] instead of [[jewgold|Gas]], ringing [[indie|Radiohead]] sirens, and driven by [[hipsters]] in Native American headresses. Tumblr trolling is needed ASAP in order to show them where they belong. Easy troll pickings though is everywhere.

==Operation Overlord==
{{main|Operation Overlord}}
[[Image:Operationoverlordtumblr1.png|thumb|center]]


Somewhere during the night of November 10, 2010, some [[newfags]] declared war on Tumblr due to the fail [[raid]] of [[Omegle]] by Tumblr. /b/ came up with Operation Overlord and reclaimed Omegle while some [[skiddies]] tried to [[DDoS]] Tumblr.
No shit this plan will fail seeing as Tumblr runs on multiple servers and half the community are [[sick fucks]] who regularly look at [[porn]] and [[gore]] to be [[ironic]]. /b/ will need to get creative. Only [[newfags]] try to [[force]] [[raid]]s and think gore is the worst they can do. [[Lurk moar]] and get to know your enemy, [[cancer]].

===How to properly troll Tumblr===

* '''Gorn''' The weak link in the Tumblr community are naive [[16 year old girls]] and high school [[scene]] [[indie]] kids who use Tumblr to [[camwhore]] and talk about their favorite shitty [[band]] like [[Blood on the Dance Floor]] and [[Katy Perry]]. These innocent naive kids who have been sheltered all their lives will be the ones most effected by gore and porn; the rest of the community spend 5 hours a day on the internet and are not phased by gorn because in their [[hipster]] careers, they've seen [[Interior Semiotics|worse]].
** When you post up the gorn, tag it with #fashion, #love, #skins, #harry potter, #food, #art, #jonas brothers, etc to ensure only the young/weak ones of their clan get the dosage. Try at best to follow the little naive kids and change your background to gorn.

*'''Heated arguments''' Tumblr is comprised of cliques, not so much a whole community. Tumblr has users from all around the world having many different interests whether it be [[furry]] porn or [[hentai]].
** Try to start race wars.
** Tell off the white [[liberal]] [[hippies]] 
** Argue furiously about how they should become [[Christians]] to "save themselves"
** Tell them you hate [[gay]] rights
** Do as any other idealogical fight

*'''Javascript''' Remember that Tumblr customization allows [[Javascript]]
**Google up HTML/Javascript redirect script and redirect them to nimp. put on blog, put up hot profile pic of hipster chick, like a bunch of posts etc
***Or pretend to be a fashion blog and put the nimp link in the click through

*'''GPOYs and Topless Tuesdays''' Find the ugly ones and post them on ED for the world to marvel at the carnival/zoo that is Tumblr

*'''Facebook''' The one thing that Tumblr hates more than [[hipster]] shit are their [[16 year old girl]] classmates. The best way to troll Tumblr is to get as many high schoolers from [[Facebook]] to come over to Tumblr and turn it into [[Myspace]]. Nothing infuriates them more than seeing cheerleaders typppe lykeeee dissss omggg and like, talk about the bessst boyfrann in teh worlddd!!111 <333333

*'''Recommended List''' if possible, get as many /b/rothas to recommend you into the recommend blogs to get more publicity

*'''Pro-anas and lias''' Search for "thinspo" "pro ana" "gb" etc and find some anorexic and bulimic girls, then go to their ask boxes and tell them how fat they are/how huge their thighs are to [[trigger]] them.


==Fail Raids==
[[Image:Tumblr.png|thumb|5/16/2010 NEVA FORGET]]
[[At least 100 years ago]], Tumblr has taken to poorly attempt [[Fail|trolling]], via [[Omegle]]. The trolling consisted mainly of starting chats, typing "HNNG", and if replied with a "HNNG", swapping Tumblr urls. Obviously, we have much to learn from these [[Lies|overly advanced]] [[Retards|beings]]. Like all fags, they're incredibly easy to [[troll]].

# Go to Omegle on a Tumblr troll day
# Start a chat with "HNNG" or "WHAT IS AIR"
# Ask for URL
# [[????]]
# PROFIT!!!

*[http://gawker.com/5689652/4chan-vs-tumblr-whoever-wins-we-all-lose ADRIAN CHEN OF GAWKER COVERS STORY] 

Comparable to the [[2012]] of Tumblr, dumbshits all over start freaking out at their impending doom. Naive simpletons simply blanked their page and put in a "lock layout", convinced somehow changing the layout automatically means not being able to be hacked.
"4chan" charts [[Twitter]] trends and various blog sites who have nothing better to talk about join in on the fun. 
Tumblrfags bid goodbye to their "precious followers" and deactivated their accounts.
Desperate and helpless, many start turning to Jew, their glorious owner and beg him for help on his twitter account. [[WTF|Everyone starts referring to him as "Daddy", used as in "Daddy's gonna save us" and "Don't worry, Daddy's here!"]].

When the [[DDoS]] attack of 11/14 began, /b/ was pumped already. Few minutes in, Tumblr was down for 1/3 and slowing for the rest. David Karp disabled ask on his blog.

[[Image:B404severything.png]]

However, some mod took down 4chan's domain but the boards were still up. Dumbshits believed Tumblr to have reversed DDoSd 4chan when in reality /b/ was betrayed by their own mods (some argue because the bad publicity was going to ruin moot's new project, Canvas). The confusion result in neither website having permanent damage but instead of [[Anonymous]] getting a sex slave. Thus out of the ashes, [[4chumblr]] was born. The epitome of everything [[cancer]], [[newfag]] and lack of organizational skill ruled by the [[ADHD]] and sex drive.

==[[Successful troll is successful]]==
{{morphquote|Quotes from Tumblr waving white flag|background-color: white; width: 900px; height: 500px;|font-weight: bold;
|[[Successful troll is successful|"Many people on Tumblr have issued responses, acceptances and even apologies on their pages, which all come down to the same thing: "Leave us alone, we didn't do anything to you". However, because they've done this on their own page, nobody will ever see it. Not many of them have considered that a statement should actually be issued somewhere where the opposing side will see it. So, on behalf of Tumblr, an open letter has been written. Please read it, and think about it. 
<br><BR>

Look, 
<br><BR>
We didn't do anything. To say that we "stole memes" from you is ridiculous. The very nature of a meme is that it spreads around the whole internet. You can't claim that everyone "stole" the Rickroll from you - if nobody had bothered with it except you, it wouldn't be as infamous as it is now. Memes spread. Deal with that. Furthermore, you know that. You know that we didn't do anything to offend you, and that it doesn't really matter. So why carry on? <br><BR>

We'll tell you why; because you were told to. You might agree with our last paragraph, but you'll still join in with the raid, so that you can say that you were a part of it. The real reason will eventually be lost. And then what? Then you yourself will become memes. Pointlessly firing off DDoSes at us, hoping that eventually you'll shut us down. Don't you think that if that was going to happen, it would've done already? It's been hours, and apart from the odd jump (which we're used to, doesn't affect us much if we have to press F5 once), the attack has failed. Some people will have logged off, out of boredom. They've realised that nothing will happen. They had the common sense to log off, give up, maybe watch a movie, go outside...or just keep browsing /b/. That last one seems most likely, but that's fine. /b/ can be a fun place, when it's not terrorizing the rest of the web. <BR><BR>

We know, we know, we trolled you too. And yeah, we failed pretty hard. But that was just an attempt to get back at you! Most people probably didn't know about 4chan until you guys did your thing, they just wanted to join the game, and get you back. It made zero impact. But that wasn't all of us. The majority of us were a little worried about the site going down, but knew that it'd be pointless to try and fight back. All we could do was survive. A few select individuals were dicks, yeah, but that wasn't the majority. In fact, the frightening beforehand was probably more effective than the actual attack! But we're done now. It's over. It's finished. Most of /b/ has forgotten, but there are still people attacking us. If you're one of them, please stop. If you're not one of them, please spread the word. Get others to stop. If you agree with this, get it on /b/ as a cease-fire for both sides. It was fun, and this day will go down in history as a moderately successful raid, but let it end now. You can say that you won if you want (you probably did), because we won't care too much, but you can have this victory. <BR><BR>

Congratulations, /b/. Game over. 

Thank you]] |— The people of tumblr}}

==How to annoy Tumblr==
#Tell them since they all worship [[Kurt Cobain]] as an idol; they should all follow in his footsteps and become [[an hero]]s
#Find a average looking girl who enjoys [[pro-ana]] photography and [[trigger]] her into [[anorexia|ED]]
#Be conservative and tell others [[art school]] and [[homeless|majors in philosophy and english]] will lead no where in life
#Along with that; point out [[Lady Gaga]] sucks to [[faggots]] and be against all gay rights
#Point out stealing [[memes]] and [[poser|pretending to be like /b/]] doesn't make them awesome
#Point out socially awkward penguin and Forever Alone are horrible and killing the ENTIRE internet
#Misspell shit like crazy. Tumblr users are [[Grammar Nazi]]'s and will go ape shit over any spelling errors even if they're typos. For example make sure you fuck up the following- your and you're; Their, they're and there; To, too and two.
#Say [[indie|Arcade Fire]] sucks major balls
#Follow them, then when they follow back, unfollow them
#Tell everyone that Joseph Gordon Levitt is sucking Taylor Lautner's cock
#Mention that you are [[pregnant loli|13 and pregnant]], enjoying partying and getting high, and pretend to like everything they like 
#Pretend to be an awkward [[indie]] boy who [[faggot|plays in a band]], [[lie|studies philosophy]] and likes the same shitty music. Wait for fangirls; ask them for nudes, [[???]] [[PROFIT]]
#Be as conservative as possible. Make sure you make it abundantly clear that you hate the liberal agenda and want everyone to believe in Jesus.
#Support the [[Tea Party]] and be proud to be [[American]]
#Be against Marijuana legalization 
#Say [[Twilight]] is better than [[Harry Potter]]
#Get as many [[16 year old girls]] from [[Facebook]] to join in order to infuriate Tumblr into complaining how it's turning into [[Myspace]]
