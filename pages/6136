'''POS''' stands for ''Pull Out Sex'' and describes a type of (<s>barely</s> extremely effective) birth control and an attempt to decrease the chance of STD transmission.  The [[cock|penis]] is removed from the [[vagina]] or [[anus]] immediately before ejaculation and the semen is deposited on the stomach, back or face of the person/plushy being fucked.  When the semen is spread along the neckline, it is referred to as a [[list of sex moves|pearl necklace]].  Your dad has given [[your mom]] several pearl necklaces over the years.

When someone on the internet chats writes "POS," they are requesting links to images and videos showing hardcore cumshots. 

== Example Usage ==
