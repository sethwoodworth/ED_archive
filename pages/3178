'''GET''' is the act of reaching a certain reply number on one of the many imageboards lurking in the darkness of the [[internets|interbutt]] that keep track of post numbers.  Popularized on [[4chan|4chan's]] [[/b/]], which receives an absolutely ridiculous amount of replies from [[anonymous]] [[pervert|users]] every day. Since then, [[fag|posters]] on other boards have begun to [[masturbation|celebrate their GETs with equal vigor]], happily begging for [[sticky|stickies]] when they reach some trivial number, like five. Which is about all [[420chan]] can hope for.

GET can also refer to the act of predicting one's post number at any time, not just at a milestone.  This can be as simple as the oft-attempted "IF DIS POAST ENDZ IN 4 THAN UR GAY LOL," to the slightly more challenging "HEY GUIZ IF I 55 GET I'LL POST NOODS I SWARES IT" to the [[Statistics|statistically]] absurd act of predicting one's entire post number. 

As trivial as the outcomes of single/double digits GETS are, they are [[Serious Business|taken very seriously]] by anon. Users that GET are considered authoritative on the [[CP|subjects of their posts]], for instance, "If this posts ends in an even number, then God is real/fake." This almost definitely ends in a flame war, as the winning side always champions the legitimacy of using GET to determine validity, the losers try to appeal to logic. These same people exchange roles continuously.

== How To GET ==


When the reply count begins to approach a significant number, generally a whole thousand, million, or some silly number like 11,223,344, people start spamming threads with "__________GET", where the blank is the number in question. Some start spamming thousands of posts in advance of the GET, either in an attempt [[FAIL|to be funny]] or an attempt to stir up competition. Nearing the post in question, the post rate [[Bullshit|increases inversely]] with the absolute distance to the GET. Refresh your browser rapidly while watching the post numbers of the latest posts, use this to gauge the post rate. Post a couple times to determine how early you would have to post to get the desired number. /b/ is absurdly fast, but it's not that fast, don't be an idiot, you get only one chance (unless you've got a botnet and/or proxy). 

==A Step-by-Step Guide to being a GET spamming Faggot==

===[[Homosexuality|Moderators]]===
# Be a [[mod]].
# GET!

===[[Newfags]]===
# Only start redundant new threads. Do not reply to existing threads.
# [[Sage|Post]] [[Furry|something]] [[CP|really]] [[Boxxy|fucking]] [[Girugamesh|retarded]].
# Make sure that within 300 posts of the GET, all new posts 404 by the time you refresh the page again.
# Break the board in question.
# Did you GET? (No -> Go back to Step 1)
# ???
# [[Winrar|GET!]]

==Aftermath==
When the post count [[orgasm|finally reaches the number in question]], it is traditional that everyone on the board reply to the thread commenting on the GET in one of the following ways:

* failget
* FAILGET
* FUCKING FAIL
* WTF IS THIS SHIT?
* modget
* MODS = FAGS
* USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST
* MySQL Connection Failure
* DESU DESU DESU
* [[sage]] goes in every field
* post number truncating goes into effect now.

Also, it's really fun to tell the [[Moderator|mods]] to sticky these content-free threads.




== GET and [[AIDS]] ==
[[image:M=f.JPG|left|thumb|This must be posted within the first [[at least 100|100]] posts of a get.]]
''Mods = fags'' therefore ''Modget = fagget''

In some cultures, acquisition of a GET is thought to cure [[AIDS]] in the same way that virgin-sex does.  In these cultures, those infected with [[AIDS]] who are too small, weak, or underdeveloped to [[rape]] [[jailbait|pre-adolescents]] compete heatedly to extend their phailishly phail lives through the acquisition of a GET.  Many examples of those spending their last years in pursuit of this elusive elixir can be found on the [[internet]]. Moast, obsessed with their own mortality, pursue GETs to the exclusion of lasting social connections or reproduction. The scientific community, unable to [[Karl Popper|disprove]] this theory, remains undecided.

Of course, the fact that anyone obsessed with getting a specific post number on a message board is constitutionally incapable of ever having gotten laid causes one to question why exactly they would need an AIDS cure in the first place. Go figure.
