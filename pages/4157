Iworshipsatin
[[Image:48875.jpg|right]]	 

{{lj|user=Iworshipsatin}} (aka '''Iworshipsatan''') is one of the [[LJDrama]] fatties (along with [[Futhman]] and Tristan, among [[you|others]]), but she has a serious [[fat|attitude]] and is also a [[drama whore]], which distinguishes her from the others. She's been around [[LJDrama]] since it was a simple [[community]], but she kept getting into retarded [[drama]] with others in the comm, and later the site, and that's why pretty much everyone hates her. She brought the retarded [[drama]] home with her when she got [[pregnant]] during a one night stand with a [[killhamster|crackhead]].[http://brainlesswonder.com/lj/iworshipsatin.html].	 
			
==Politics==

A raging [[liberal]], Iworshipsatin that has the "[[George W Bush]] [http://www.livejournal.com/community/colorbar_love/57416.html is hate]" [[colorbar]] on her [[user info]]. Because of her [[socialist]] tendencies, she very quickly realized she would not have any friends in the [[debate]] community, and she created her own debate-style community, {{ljcomm|thought_club}}. Thought club is a group for furry [[bestiality|zoophiles]] who [[rape]] and sacrifice chickens (and of course EAT them FAT FAT FAT).

In 2001, while [[moderator|moderating]] the disaster of thought_club, she was prodded to break out the [[font size=5|big font]] and declare [http://www.livejournal.com/community/debate/128554.html I DID NOT DELETE THE DAMN ENTRY]. Four years later that phrase is still in use in the [[debate]] community as an [[:Category:In Jokes|in joke]], and that's a sad story unto itself.
People with small genitalia still bring it up today because of their limited cognitive abilities to come up with any new fat jokes.

==Iworshipsatin and Fat==	 
OK, she's seriously [[fat]]. She's on [[nonuglyfats]] and other "[[fat]] is OK" communities. Her obesity warrants a level 2 headline.	 
	 
===The [[MRI]] story===

In 2002, Iworshipsatin had to get tested for her [[internet disease|multiple sclerosis]], but could not fit into the MRI. Later on, [[Samia]] and [[Futhman]] were having an argument with Iworshipsatin, and she said on his journal, "YOU wouldn't fit into an MRI either!" to Futhman. This is true, because he is fat also. Nevertheless, the phrase quickly became an [[:Category:In Jokes|in-joke]] in the [[LJDrama]] crowd.

In 2006 she successfully fit in an MRI!
