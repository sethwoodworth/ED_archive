'''Santorum''' can refer to:
# The frothy mix of [[cum|ejaculate]] and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of [[anal sex]]. It may also include [[Silken Secret|lube]].  But who uses lube?
# Any other composite miasma of unpleasantness metaphorically similar to said frothy mix.
# An ultra-[[conservative]] Senator who has since been thrown out of the [[United States]] Congress for being a [[fag]].

Rick Santorum was thrown out of [[crap|congress]] in November of 2006, after allegedly [[rape|fagging it up]] with [[fat|Dick Cheney]]. He was an ultra-[[conservative|ghey]] Senator in the [[United States]] Congress.  A [[Republican]] who gained [[notoriety]] for being like most other Americans - afraid of [[homosexual|homosexuals]], [[pedophiles]], and [[furries]].  His commentary after a [[Supreme Court]] ruling on [[in the ass|buttsex]] laws was the source of many [[lulz]] for [[liberals]] and made [[Dan Savage]] mad enough to equate his name to [[poop|the end result]] of [[gay]] [[sex]].

Rick also made [[lulz|the news]] of the weird by bringing his wife's miscarried [[alien|fetus]] home from the hospital so his ([[Life|living]] but presumably traumatized) [[abortion|child]] could hug it and kiss it and say goodbye.  This is perhaps the most "how to make a [[serial killer]]" formula example of aberrantly fucked-up parenting since Joan adopted Christina.

When not being completely offensive Rick is just plain [[gay|insane]]. A huge [[fanboy]] of ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', the [[liar|Senator]] recently compared the war in [[Iraq]] to the battle for Middle Earth. [http://hotair.com/archives/2006/10/18/santorum-compares-jihadis-to-eye-of-mordor/]

==Santorum The Substance==
Santorum is defined as: The frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex. This definition was popularized by the American columnist Dan Savage, in 2003. He was pissed that Santorum hated gay faggots like him, basically was his deal

The root of the word '''Santorum''' is best described by a [[Stephen Hawking]]

<blockquote>
''I was intrigued by your recent revival of an old Latin term for the by now familiar frothy agglomeration. While "Santorum" is an excellent word, it is a sad reminder of the state of the English language when opaque latinate lexica eclipse our solid Germanic root stock. After all, there is nothing wrong with the fine old Anglo-Saxon "buttbutter," the rustic charm of which evokes the scents and sensibilities of a stolid British grammar school. As regards this particular trope, English is fairly typical of Western European languages; witness the German cognate, "Arschbutter," or the French "beurre anal." Spanish, however, is an interesting exception. The term "Alsaon," like so many Spanish words that have survived since the end of the Moorish occupation, is derived from a Maghrebi-Berber term, which is in turn a corruption of a Latin loan word, none other than "Santorum"!''
