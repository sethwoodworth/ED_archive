'''Steam Furries''' is a [[retarded|Furry Pride]] group on [[Steam]]. 'Steam Furries' like any other group for [[furries]] is full of [[retards]], hypocrites, and [[lie|totally not zoophiles or pedophiles]] people to [[fuck|meet]] each other, [[fuck|play]] together, and roll around in massive amounts of [[drama]]. Members like to show [[idiocy|pride]] by adding shitty ascii and descriptions of their [[shit|creative]] [[fursona]]. The group was created on August 8, 2007 by [[Ghost Menjou]], the overly-sensitive founder who has in the past shown signs of [[rape victim|daddy issues]], as he goes into a faggot rage over [[serious business|something someone says on the internet]], especially if it be a description of what [[furry art]] [[rape|does to your eyes]]. In order to protect the rest of the world from his own sheltered [[pussy]], he immediately bans any individual who dares use the word "[[rape]]" in his royal chat room, and proceeds to [[B&|ban]] anyone who objects to him doing so. He also believes that there are no other [[orgies|furry communities]] in existence for those who he's banned to go to, [[unwarranted self importance|and feels that he has affected the lives of the people whom he's banned in a negative way]]. after a good day's [[lurk|work]] he ventures into his parent's bathroom to [[masturbate]] furiously with a razor blade. The [[disregard that|otherwise]] [[lie|decent]] community agrees that it is a shame that they must all deal with this over-powered nerd in order to continue [[yiff|communication]] with each other.
==Cc2iscool's Server Hierarchy==
[[File:Stuffed raccoon.gif|thumb|left|400px|[[Gabe Newell|Who knew?]]]]

If Zen is the most famous artist in the world of furfaggotry, then Cc2iscool is the [[god]] of furry gaming. CC2 currently has 5 servers running ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. His servers are constantly full, adding to the owner's ego. 

Cc2iscool runs a [[Ventrilo]] server for [[furries]] who play on his servers ([[fact|but this is retarded and redundant as there is in-game voice chat]]). Common subjects of conversation above grunting involve bitching about team stacking, and complimenting each other on their porn sprays that frequent the server. There is a separate channel for [[Team Fortress 2]] but many [[retards|people]] just idle in the lobby and mic spam.

[[Yiffing]] on the server is forbidden to the dismay of every furry ever (Even though you can still fucking spray porn.), and from time to time, /b/tards enter the server undercover and annoy furfags apparently unaware of the Mute Players option.

Every Friday night at 7PM Ct they begin a massive [[orgy|party]] in which they jam pack the three group severs for 10 hours, as they are furries and have nothing to do anyways.

Cc2iscooL [[dumbass|gave away his personal contact info]], [[probably|not]] knowing that it would fall into the hands of a newfag who posted it on /b/, and not a single fuck was given that day.
