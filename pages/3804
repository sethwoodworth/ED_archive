'''Hunter S. Thompson''' was a noted [[IRL]] [[troll]] and pretty much the lulziest journalist of all time. [[Fact|Rumor has it]] that he died doing what he loved: screaming his tits off as imaginary pink elephants ate his liver.

==The Man==
Born in Louisville, [[Kentucky|Kentukkky]] at the age of 45, Hunter distinguished himself with his early alcoholism and [[Psychopath|criminal activity]]. [[Nigra|Jobless]], and having little to no foothold in [[Insane|reality]], Hunter took to journalism to pay for his huge [[IRC]] addiction. By writing his articles while completely [[Batshit insane|off his tits]], he inadvertently stumbled upon a winning style of [[lulz]]y writing he liked to call "Gonzo Journalism", though others preferred the more descriptive "Whacked-out Stream of Consciousness Ravings". 

==Gonzo the spy==
Internets may tell you that the Good Doctor was in fact a [[CIA]] agent. Writers of these conspiracies make these accusations based on the fact that they tried to get away with half the shit he did and they ended up:
*Insane.
*In[[Raped|Jail]].
*InHospital
*InTheGround

==Notable Works==
*Kidnapping.
*Insanity.
*Writing for an Air Force newspaper.
*Shooting Peacocks on his property.
*Shooting anything on his property.
*Shooting himself on his property.
*[[Fun|Shooting Drugs]].
*Trolling ESPN forums.
*Inspiring Transmetropolitan

==LSD Advocacy==
Despite the [[fact]] that [[LSD]] had brought him total [[ruin]]ation, Hunter remained a firm advocate of its use, particularly by the under-6's. In this, his name was added next to Ken Kesey's and Timothy Leary's on the long list of advocates for hard psychotropic drugs that are produced by [[n00bs]] in someone's bathroom, bringing the total to three. On one occasion Thompson created mass [[Lulz]] at a '''Rolling Stone'' magazine retreat when he approached every single person there with what he claimed was his "''very last tab, so keep it quiet''". One can only imagine the fun of being in a crowd of acid-soaked ''Rolling Stone'' employees! Then one can't help to imagine the fun of a giant asteroid dropping right on top of the whole thing and wiping those whiny [[liberal]] RS [[fucktard]]s right off the face of the planet.

==[[Suicide|Self-Pwning]]==
Hunter [[An Hero|became an hero]] on February 20th, 2005. It was a victory for the [[America]]n firearms industry, but a sad loss for the [[America]]n [[Drug]] Industry. His first wife Sandy claimed that "he shot out of the womb pissed-off, and he went out the same way." A [[Joke]]r to the end, he was actually talking to his wife as he blasted his brains all over his study. His suicide note (with the hastily scrawled message "[[Handegg|Football Season Is Over]]" written in black marker as a title) read:

<br><br>
"''No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy. No Fun ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ for anybody. 67. You are getting Greedy. Act your old age. Relax ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ This won't hurt''"<br>

Probably the funniest part about his [[suicide|self-pwning]] was that he called his wife right before [[Banned IRL|kickbanning]] himself, and just as he swallowed that [[shotgun mouthwash]] his wife stopped listening to fix something on the car radio.

==Res-[[erection]]==
On the third day, Hunter S Thompson [[Jesus|rose again]], this time in meme form. Hero-worshiping [[/b/tards]] began [[spam]]ming [[Gif|image macros]] featuring his quotes far and wide. This has done much to further cement his legacy into the [[thread]]s of the OL and IRL worlds, in spite of culling a large [[poseur]] fanbase in the process.



==Hunter's IRL Trolling Techniques==

*Spraypainting "Fuck the [[Pope]]" on the boat of the [[Australia]]n racing team.
*Leaving a trail of [[meth]]amphetamines through Huston airport's customs.
*Diffusing uncomfortable social situations with high-power mace.
*Calling his Mexican attorney a Samoan.
*Screaming lines from the [[The Rapture|Book of Revelation]] in crowded hotels.
*Handing people money, then saying that he needs it back to eat.
*Getting [[Nixon]]'s [[Nazi|SS]] agents drunk on Wild Turkey.
*Never forgiving his brother for being a hellbound [[fgt]].
*Convincing people he was going to be murdered. When in reality, he was just going to self-pwn himself and frame the C.I.A.
*Trolling everyone into believing presidential candidate Ed Muskie was an Ibogaine addict
