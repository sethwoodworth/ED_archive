[[Kathy Sierra]] is a lifetime story in the making. Once upon a time, in the land of [[tl;dr]], a little girl named [[Terri Schiavo|Kathy]] pondered how she could make big [[drama]]s in the future.

When she had nearly grown up, she dreamed of being a [[blogger|bloviator]], flying around in a tiny little [[ROFL|ROFLcopter]] and dispensing minimal amounts of [[lulz]].

Thus we have a portrait of a woman [[Internet Humanitarianism|overcoming adversity]]. You may find the arena sort of ironic. Okay, she gained publicity, was threatened and harassed via e-mail, and now she is on a campaign to save the world.

She is a woman fighting for the rights of [[blogger]]s; talentless, uneducated narcissists who spread their narrow views in public journals.

She is most certainly [[Lie|not]] a [[drama]]tist or [[attention whore]]. If you think she has a [[victim complex]], fuck you, you insensitive fuck, just '''FUCK YOU''' <sob!>.

{{quote|It's the ''threat'' that causes fear.

It's the ''threat'' that leads you to a psychiatrist and tranquilizers just so you can sleep without repeating the endless loop of your death by:

* throat slitting
* hanging
* suffocation
and don't forget the [[sex]]ual [[Cyberrape|part]]...

I have cancelled all speaking engagements.

I am afraid to leave my yard.

When you touch a hot stove, don't you usually react by taking your hand off? By analogy, if Kathy was genuinely hurt, wouldn't the logical reaction be [[wikibreak|taking a break from the internet]]? Not in this case, Kathy Sierra is a [[feminist]] who believes she should be pitied, protected, embellished, and glorified. Psychologically damaged, she so altruistically decided to use her identity as a woman and a victim of moderate [[trolling|electronic harassment]] to stir up [[drama]] and press. Salivating for more, she used the appropriate channels (certainly nothing relating to her publisher, O'Reilly) to attract media. She was now [[attention whoring]] at the nth level.

In [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6502643.stm this BBC article], Tim O'Reilly, the [[Al Gore]] of [[Web 2.0]] and Sierra's publisher came to the podium, calling for a [[Blogger's Code of Conduct|blogger code of conduct]]. In other words, he intends to encourage blogging websites to crack down on free speech. Perhaps it would be a bit more convincing if he wasn't sleeping on bags of gold and stock in his publishing company. One could consider he is a kingpin in a cabal with Kathy Sierra to create an anti-[[troll]] street team comprised of zealous bloggers and fanboy vigilante. A system of power where they are the [[internet police|executive]] and [[internet judge|judiciary]], and ruthlessly crush anyone who doesn't follow O'Reilly scripture. In the meantime, O'Reilly can go publish [[1984]], and since times change, they will have an excuse for you to buy another edition every year. More recently, [[Jimbo Wales|this clown]] has jumped in for a piece of the speech-control action.

==Early Life==
As mentioned in the recent article highlighting the true persona of our heroine, she is not quite what she seems. We can only speculate as to what events lead up to the [[fail]]ures in life demonstrated by her very public behavior. One problem is that like many gals who despise mathematics and science, she wanted to become a programmer for the glory but couldn't, so she had to fake it. Not that there aren't many who can, but ... So, she ended up making up motivational speeches and writing bad textbooks along the same lines, all the time biting her nails wondering if anyone would ever catch her out. One can also easily find liberal doses of other forms of "bad faith" along the way.

==Marriage==

As it turns out, during her initial string of failed attempts at normality, Katherine became the wife of one John Kozel. Now it appears that John knew exactly what to do with this type of woman and didn't hesitate to show her who the fuck runs the show. Despite her need to please the abusive men in her life Kathy ended up in the local emergency room a couple times too many even by her standards.

==Knight in Shining Armor (Fixer Complex)==
Enter the hero of our story, "Master" (Albert) Bates. At the lowest point in Kathy's existence the <strike>love</strike> enabler of her life made his first appearance. After numerous adulterous encounters, Bates decided that Kathy's head game was good enough to make this a semi-permanent relationship. The two got a weekly rate special at the local Red Roof Inn and Kathy filed for divorce.

==Darkest Hour==
[[Image:DESUMURDER.JPG|thumb|TYPE [[DESU]] AGAIN!]]
[[Image:Psychoswirlkat.jpg|thumb|frame|250px|left|The fear!]]When you achieve the level of fame and success that Kathy has there are bound to be detractors and nay-sayers, but no person deserves what was lying in wait for our girl. At the pinnacle of Kathy's "career" some critics of her "work" took the joking a bit too far and the resulting backlash will be most likely be felt for decades to come. These malicious comments expanded on various sexual acts that the poster desired to perform with Ms. Sierra and later progressed to threats of violence. The internet being the serious place that it is, these threats were not taken lightly. Kathy, [[butthurt]] to the max., proceeded to cancel all "BloggerCon" appearances, locked herself into her luxury hotel room, and used the only voice she had to shed light on this atrocity:

:''Tim O'Reilly, you've got to help my insane campaign.''

Since then, she's been riding the [[Whambulance]] all the way to the bank.

== The unravelling of irony ==
[[Image:Kathythetease.gif|frame|center|Remember that girl back in high school who would constantly joke about sex for attention, but call you a pervert when you came onto her? (based on her blog logo)]] 

[[Image:Oreilly.gif|frame|center|"There are some really ignorant, greedy, embellishing bureaucrats out there on the internet. We shouldn't let you speak on behalf of the [[interweb]] or [[lulz]] either. If you want censorship liek [[1984]], go to fucking [[Turkey]]." [[Joseph Evers]] (Collective works, Lulz Press, 2004, )]]
