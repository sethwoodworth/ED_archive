Rob's Law
{{Elaw}}  
'''Rob's Law''' or '''Graves' Law''' states that the amount of pain or humiliation in any life event is directly proportional to the entertainment value of the subsequent story. 

This can be seen in [[LiveJournal]] communities such as {{ljcomm|bad_sex}} and {{ljcomm|customers_suck}}, in the crap drama our friends start, and on the venerable [[LJDrama]]. The law is named after the Ball State student who is credited with creating the law. The Germans already had a word for it, but that doesn't matter where [[internets]] credit is concerned.

One can add their own examples and proof of Rob's Law in {{ljcomm|robslaw}}.

==Rob's Law [[IRL]]==
A non-internet example of Rob's Law can be found in the blues, where the most depressing or affecting songs are considered the best. Rob's Law is also demonstrated on [[television]] in the form of trashy soap operas, humiliating reality TV series, and ''Maury Povich''.
