Callum Cartel is a morbidly obese 17 year old boy who wanted to be an Internet Sheriff on [[YouTube]], but he '''appeared''' to give up on his dream when people pointed out that he was [[fat]]. 

In secret, Callum recruited a group of [[13 year old boys]] that he knew [[IRL]] and videoed them reading out Callum's own hateful and abusive rants targeted at [[You | innocent victims]] on YouTube with the intention of bullying them off the site. At the same time the hypocritical bastard posted videos of himself telling people that there was no place for bullies on YouTube.


== Callum Cartel's Dummy Accounts ==
 
Apart from the [[13 year old boy]]s he had recruited to do his dirty work and the people that they attacked, noone watched Callum Cartel's videos. This was not surprising as all he talked about were large, sweaty men stripping down to their underwear and getting to grips with each other (this is apparently called [[wrestling]] by the [[Gay | Gay Fraternity]]). 

Callum enjoyed making videos of himself wrestling with [[13 year old boy]]s on his bed, although he said he did not know why he liked it. (This situation is likely to have changed now, as his recent activities have brought him into contact with a pedophile called [[Irish282]] on the YouTube website).  

Callum hid his shameful unpopularity by creating over 80 fake accounts on YouTube which he used to subscribe to himself, watch and favorite his videos and, most bizarrely of all, reply to his own comments on those videos.

He also used the fake accounts to subscribe to all the [[13 year old boys]] he was grooming.

== Callum Cartel's Internet Sheriff Activities ==

Like all Internet Sheriffs, Callum Cartel needed to find someone who was being victimised so that he could condemn, harass, bully, vilify and swear at the [[you | victim's attacker]] whilst being seen to retain the [[KKK | "moral high ground"]].

Callum Cartel was jealous of {{youtube2|Reymon14|Reymon14}} because Reymon14 made more entertaining wrestling videos than he did. He also thought Reymon14 must obviously be somebody's victim because he had a speech impediment. 

Reymon14 made videos impersonating wrestlers for fun. Vivalajustin mimicked Reymon14's impersonations, complete with speech impediment, also for fun, as a friend with no malicious intent. 

Oblivious to the actual situation, Callum Calbert rushed in (Internet Sheriff-style), thinking that  Vivalajustin's spoof video was the perfect oppurtunity to throw his Internet-weight around. 

He made two videos ordering {{youtube2|vivalajustin|vivalajustin}} to leave Reymon14 alone. Callum took the oppurtunity to point out thst he was better than Vivalajustin because he had more subscribers, despite this being a lie (since Callum had subscribed to himself with 77 dummy accounts and the 3 accounts on which he posted the videos of his [[13 year old boys]]).

The following gallery includes a blow-by-blow account of the events.

== Callum Cartel's Puppets ==

Since Callum had be completely owned by Vivalajustin, and his Internets were surrounded by TheAbyss91, he decided to deputize some other [[13 year old boys]] to do the public part of his Internet Sheriff work for him.

[[Image:RightJordan.jpg|thumb|Jordan. The 17 year old fugly [[ginger]] chav that wastes his evenings talking to Paperlilies on MSN]]
Callum claimed in his {{youtube|F5l2pfriRWk|"CallumCartels: Top 5 Youtubers Of 2006!"}} video that Jordan (one of his deputies) was messaging [[Paperlilies]] on MSN for an hour whilst Jordan and he were both in Jordan's  bedroom, which according to Callum officially made Paperlilies his (Callum's) E-girlfriend. 

[[HellionExciter]] said some mean things about Paperlilies that he felt had to be said, (which took him about week's worth of videos to do), and Callum decided it was officially his Internet Sheriff duty to defend Paperlilies' [[Honorz]].

He videoed Liam O'Brien (a minor) reading out a stream of abuse directed at [[HellionExciter]] and then he posted it on the {{youtube2|ThatLiamLad|ThatLiamLad}} channel.

In a highly-charged video response [[HellionExciter]] '''declared war''' on ThatLiamLad and made enquiries on the Internet about purchasing a Russian tank that he could use to run Liam over. 

<s>{{youtube|HCCuuF_OtTo|The HellionExciter is attacked by a 8 year old Mega Lol}}</s> - '''Removed by YouTube''' (Only clips of the video now remain in Blunty3000's parody {{youtube|aUAXgN6K18k|How 2 looz at teh Internetz}})

Callum Cartel posted another video of Liam O'Brien reading his [[Internet tough guy]] script, trying to milk the 15 minutes of pseudo-recognition that HellionExciter had given to one of his channels.

{{youtube|IDd2JZbVenA|HellionExciter wants a War? Hes got one.}}


Callum's attempt at being an internet Sheriff had turned into a high profile farce. Comedian {{youtube2|Montagraph|Montagraph}} and Internet pan-handler [[Blunty3000]] both decided to get in on the action too. 

{{youtube|hkv16eMWjDw|Re: The HellionExciter is attacked by a 8 year old !!!!!!!!! - From Montograph  - 5 April 2007}}



In the following video, Blunty3000 ironically fails to draw the parallel between '''Internet Sheriff Callum Cartel with his flunky Liam O'Brien''' (aka ThatLiamLad), and '''Internet Sheriff Damien Estreich and his flunky Nate Burr''' (aka Blunty3000).

Callum Cartel posted another video on his ThatLiamLad channel, this time of himself and [[Ginger | angry-ginger]] Jordan. In the video Jordan threatened that if HellionExciter didn't back off he would start making videos about him (even though he had already made two videos about HellionExciter using 13 year old Liam). Callum stated that he was not homophobic (he is a wrestling fan, so no surprises there) and that if anyone was ever found hiding under his bed they would be [[gay]]. It is unclear why there are so many references made to homosexuality in the video, but many people believe that [[Irish282]]'s hand is now on Callum Cartel's [[Cock | rudder]].
