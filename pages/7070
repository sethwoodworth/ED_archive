'''Rootbrian''' is a 27-year-old [[bipolar|passive-aggressive]] [[YouTube]] [[lolcow]] and anti-[[cyber bully]]ing "activist" from [[Canadia]] who has an evenly shorn ex-unibrow, a [[Dental Plan|grill]] worse than [[Jawsus]]', and the personality of a kitchen utensil.  An [[unemployed]], mildly [[Anonymous|autistic]]  5'4" dwarf ([[penis|no, srsly]]), he has become known as a motherload of LOL on the tubes.  He specializes in [[spamming|producing]] an unbelievable number of [[TL;DR|informative]] and [[gay|meaningful]] videos on a wide variety of [[shit|subjects]] he feels are [[SNCA|important]], as well as providing the odd [[lolcano]] here and there. Brian lives at home [[incest|in a shared room with his brother]] and mother on a steady diet of [[welfare|government cheese]] and is, by far, one of YouTube's biggest sources of [[lulz]] to date.  Rootbrian is basically the YouTube equivalent of that bloody car crash you can't help but slow down to look at.  He's a staunch [[Paul Fetch|Fetch]] [[fanboi]], [[YTV]] supporter, and [[wannabe]] Anon with [[unrealistic expectations|high hopes]] for the tubes and feels he could [[e-fame|hit it big]] if only teh "[[haters]]" would leave him alone. He dreams of getting his own bedroom someday, and scoring a solid [[Dental Plan|dental plan]] if only his [[fugly|mother]] would shell out some [[rich|welfare money]].

On June 18th 2008, Rootbrian's (more like Rootcanal amirite?) video (now removed) caught Anon's attention. In this video, he threatened [[Scientology|the faceless collective of anonymous Internet users]] with his [[personal army]], claiming that if anyone ever tries to [[rape|attack]] him or his friends, there will be blood. This was seemingly done for no other reason than to [[attention whore|draw attention to himself]] and act like a [[Internet tough guy|tough guy online]].

{{quote|"Fuck with or bully me and you'll have to face my friends too."|Brian}}

An ebaums thread ensued shortly thereafter and minutes later the first thread [[404]]'ed with a [[over 9000|shitload]] of [[rage]] posts, the [[raid]] organization on the target subsequently moving to a vent server.  Anon managed to grab his info, which wasn't hard to find as Brian had posted it on the interwebs for the sake of [[ronery|finding]] new Internet friends for this [[Loser|god amongst men]].

Luckily, there have suddenly been hundreds of "friends" calling his home and cell phones, making sure he's getting enough [[cake|delicious]] food delivered to his house. While the vent channel has been generating mediocre lulz, the half-anon <b>snipe</b> ate some steroids and <i>[[Ruination|convinced]]</i> the target to make an exclusive apology video, for otherwise he would provide anon with his [[IP]] and [[Rape|the food treatments]] would continue for a [[at least 100 years|very long time]]. 

<center>{{frame|<youtube>4zCyE_AFmu4</youtube>}}</center><br>

According to the videos he made after the raid, [[anon]] converted his brain into pure [[Cancer|cancer]]. With the [[Lulz|common needs]] satisfied by the traumatized victim, anon moved on to [[Suicide|more important things]].

==Reaction to [[wiki|Wikification]]==
[[Image:Typical_Rootbrian_comments_Oct._8.png|thumb|Brian distilled.  He's reknown as one of the lulziest commenters on all of YouTube and perhaps one of the easiest to troll.  This is essentially a carbon copy of every comment thread Brian has ever spammed.]]
Of course, it didn't take long for this hilarious event and one of YouTube's biggest [[lulzcow]]s to be documented on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|this website]]. After discovering that he was still being [[troll]]ed and that his YouTube shenanigans had been wikified, Brian offered his thoughts on the [[article]]. Unfortunately, this very lulzy video is no longer available since it was posted under one of his older accounts -- which was rightfully [[banned]].  A quote from the video:

[[Image:Rootfag not caring.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rootbrian clearly demonstrating just how much he ignores the haters and his paranoia towards Youtube's "censorship software".]]

Anon lost interest in Brian rather quickly following the initial lulz, but he very willingly spent most of the summer of [[2008]] quite willingly grovelling at the feet of Anon and ED, pleading for others not to troll him. Brian's ability to [[retard|read between the lines]] isn't that great though, and apparently [[obvious|that affability was false]].  So at the whiff of possible retaliation against his [[trolls|oppressors]] -due to the claims of [[Tehbigtoaster|some 13 year old]]- he quickly did a [[180°]] when convinced he could get that sweet, sweet [[unrealistic expectations|revenge]] against his "[[haters]]"....

{{quote|World peace has hit the internet!!|Brian}} 

[[Epic lulz]] ensued shortly thereafter as, due to incidental [[ED is slow|downtime]] on Aug 25th, Brian had assumed that he had actually '''achieved''' that promised "revenge" and promptly blew his load at the prospect of his article disappearing.  He immediately posted an extremely lulzy victory video titled "[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=88b_1244450084 ED IS TAKEN DOWN]!!" declaring that "[[LOL WUT|Anonymous has taken down ED]]".  3 hours later Brian realized what had [[nothing|happened]] and promptly posted a lulzy [[backpedal]] video before he quickly sank back into his clinical [[depression]] and returned to his rigorous masturbation schedule of spamming YouTube with moar lulzy shit. He apparently did not realize that Anonymous is not on his side, and that they want to make him voluntarily become [[an hero]].


==Brian's Butthurt==

[[Image:Rootbrian_pedobear.jpg|thumb|left|Brian loevs loli.]]

To those who still don't know, this article was removed toward the end of 2008 as a result of Brian himself sending in numerous false DMCA's against the '''entire contents of the article''' out of extreme [[butthurt]]. As you can see, the article was restored after somebody finally decided to stop being lazy and counter Brian's bogus DMCA take down requests, despite his desperate (and illegal) actions to have it removed. Brian has a little trouble understanding how the [[DMCA]] and [[law|lawls]] work though, as he is known for his abuse of the DMCA - on YouTube and elsewhere - believing it can be used against anything remotely referential to him or his YouTube channel(s). Gee, [[Michael Crook|sounds familiar]].  

It was also revealed, shortly before his original account went down - in which he had uploaded '''OVER 1,000 FUCKING VIDEOS''' (no, SRSLY) - that the [http://www.rootbrian.com rootbrian.com] website (the website which was supposedly set up by one of his "fans") was in fact set up by himself. No, we're not joking. Brian and the website "owner's" [[IP]]s were [[phished]] on the same day and were [[OH SHI-|identical]], which also means the {{youtube2|rootbrianfan|rootbrianfan}} channel is his - Brian seems to like [[no life|talking to himself]].  

Brian got raped by the YouTube [[banhammer]] not long after only to return immediately as {{youtube2|r00tbrian|r00tbrian}} wherein he continued to [[spam]] and [[cry moar|whine]] incessantly as always. He started wearing a [[Guy Fawkes]] mask for some reason, supposedly because that's what all the [[Anon|kool kids]] were doing and he [[newfag|wanted to fit in]]. Still, this was a vast improvement over the usual [[fugly|fugliness]] viewers are subjected to when watching his [[tl;dw]] faggotry. But he wasn't around long before he was [[suspended]], only to return, once again, as {{youtube2|0RecoveryIsPossible0|0RecoveryIsPossible0}}. It was also recently revealed that he [http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=87d_1244449291 uses a cane IRL].  [[LOL]].

Epic lulz occured when Brian made a series of lulzy responses in early [[2009]] regarding evidence that surfaced suggesting he has somewhat of an [[Pedobear|unhealthy]] interest in underage girls (presumably in some desperate effort to convince people he wasn't watching [[R@ygold]] in his spare time). Brian has since done a great job dispelling these accusations by surreptitiously consorting with the [[YTV]] and the likes of [[Dynacatlovesme]] (who has scripted a couple of videos for him as it turns out).  After being outted as having pedo tendencies for some reason he also made a video where he [http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=f7a_1244452062 vlogged from the mall about it] . Incidentally, in this follow-up Brian states that [http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=cf4_1244452110 Circuit City is conspiring to take down the YouTube Yahweh Clan] Who knew? 

But that wasn't all...he actually [[Epic lulz|got his mother to respond ON video]]!!!!!

After shitting out hundreds more videos of the same Rootfaggotry, his {{youtube2|0RecoveryisPossible0|0RecoveryisPossible0}} account got banned [[for great justice]].  He returned yet again under {{youtube2|TheOriginalRootbrian|TheOriginalRootbrian}} and began his spamming shitstorm with a very lulzy video <s>{{youtube|UZQq69VMiAo|where he cries onscreen}}</s> '''-TOS bawleeted''' (Check 5:46, see for yourself) but [[lulz|claims something got in his eye]].  His recent focus has been on uncovering the sekrit [[conspiracy]] that YouTube has against him, since they keep "[[censorship|censoring]]" his videos and banning him for polluting the site with garbage.  He even threatened to [[Lawlsuit|SUE YOUTUBE]].  FUCKING LOL.

==ED Amazon Store==

[[Image:Rootbrian_cock_goes_where.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Brian loves penis]]
April 28th, 2009, lulz were had as Brian put out an [[Goronchev|ultra smug]] video claiming that he had gotten items "removed" from ED's [http://astore.amazon.com/edvendetta-20 Amazon.com store].  What were removed were teddy bears that were wearing t-shirts that said "[[Pedobear|I <3 pedo]]" on them. In reality Pedo was a [[Swine Flu|Mexican]] kid with cancer that they were selling the bears for to raise money for his treatment. No [[srs|seriously]]. 

In reality, ED's Amazon store just finds shit on Amazon and adds them to the store, [[latin|i.e.]] nothing can be "removed" as such, only from Amazon in general.  Basically, it wasn't ED that was actually selling anything, it's Amazon, and we just pick a bunch of items that are relevant. It's a little [[Some argue|doubtful]] he will have the same success getting "[[PS3|Play Station 3]] bundle" and "[[Rick Astley]] CD" removed.  So basically it was a huge victory for anyone and everyone who hates Teddy bears.

[[Image:Rootbrian Motivator.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]
[[Image:2hourbreak!2.jpg |thumb|right|300px| Two-hour break my ass!]]

Once this article was reinstated in late April [[2009]], it didn't take long for enterprising trolls to alert Brian of the article's continued existence, which in turn led Brian to set out to prove just how little he cares about his article.  In typical Brian fashion he accomplished this, of course, by [[Aspierations|making a nine minute video a mere one day later whining about how little he cared about it]].  This one, entitled ''Down with Encyclopedia Dramatica'', continues Brian's long-held tradition of battering YouTube with [[BAW|whiny bullshit]] and hilarious stupidity.  In the video, Brian gives an in depth view of how little he knows about [[Internet Law|legal issues]] and makes several very bad attempts at insulting the site that he supposedly doesn't care about.  He even touches upon the [[hot topic]] of saying that [[Uncyclopedia]] is better than [[ED]], which is like walking into an apple orchard and trying to piss off the farmers by telling them how much you love oranges.

<center><youtube>3rcM76tfrEw</youtube></center>

As you can see, Brian also makes several proud proclamations of how his video "can't be embedded," as it seems he finally figured out how to edit the settings of his videos, but still can't understand how easy it is to reupload videos to YouTube or any other media site on the internet.

YouTuber {{youtube2|AbsenceReborn|AbsenceReborn}}, with whom Brian had had previous disputes, made a fantastic video summating Brian's faggotry in general.  One of dozens and dozens people have made mocking Brian, it basically summates Brian's retardedness distilled - to which Brian answered in [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxj-I4LsCYY his usual retarded fashion].  Brian also then attempted to [[backpedal]] yet again by stating that he "[[:Image:Trollface.png|only made the video for the lulz]]." (Video removed due to Brian crying to YouTube again)

Of course, Rootbrian has been faking for over two years now. Fast forward to 2010 and Rootbrian is already butthurt over the Twitter spam he is getting. End result - he watches his ED article constantly to remove good stuff in secret. However his attempts are pretty futile resulting in everything getting reverted.

==Deja Vu==

Fortunately, Brian isn't very good at [[Rootbrian#Rootfaggotry|learning from history]].  And as expected, Brian didn't fail to provide [[lulz]] when ED was down (for a whole day!) on May 12th, [[2009]], when he became quite [[I came|excited]] and (you guessed it) posted a series of extremely lulzy responses.  All Brian's E-dreams seemingly came true when he rejoiced at ED being "gone forever".  When she came back, as she always does, Brian got that ol' sinking feeling again to the delight of the YouTube [[troll]] community.  Oh Brian :(

{{quote|Holy shit, I used to work with this guy at a supermarket in Toronto. His name's Brian, and he's a mess. It was a lame job I took just because I didn't have anything else at the time. We mainly just cleared the parking lot of shopping carts. The boss pretty much hired whoever without any prior screening, which is the only way this guy could get a job, I think. Other co-workers included his older brother, as well as a socially inept friend of mine who got me the job, and a Portuguese man who barely spoke English. I am not exaggerating in the slightest. The first day he came to work, he almost didn't come in because he just didn't feel like showing up, and almost stiffed his own brother with having to work a double shift. Yes, his first day. While he worked there, he'd consistently do inappropriate or destructive things like pop plastic bags (scaring customers), and just toss any garbage he found inside the carts onto the ground even after I told him he shouldn't do that (even in full view of the janitor). One day he found an old lightbulb and said he would put it in the microwave in the staff room. I tried to reason with him. I even told him that I use that microwave so I didn't want him to mess with it. But he was convinced it would be a great idea. I finally left saying I wouldn't be a party to it. Even though I tried to pretend I didn't know what was going on, he didn't wait for me to leave the room before he started. My boss lost his contract with that store and we all lost our jobs because of it. I wonder why.|[[anonymous]]}}

==MOAR==
On the evening of June 16, 2010 Rootbrian made a video blog about how he intends on going into the Apple Store in the Eaton Centre Mall in Toronto and destroying several demo units of the iPad they have on display. Jewtube troller TheMissingTooth immediately emailed mall management the video link, who replied that Apple Store staff and management have been informed, as well as mall security. It was also mirrored on several sock accounts as well, to prevent Rootfaggot from trying to delete it in an attempt to cover his tracks.

== Rootbrian fights against false flaggers ==

Brian in an attempt to take down people who were "false flagging" his videos made a video promoting a new team that was against false flagging. The team was known simply as "Team [[Fail|Win]]" needless to say this team effort failed at what it was supposed to do. Stop people from flagging his videos lol.

[[Image:N617253021 1476746 7268.jpg|thumb|right|270px|OH LAWD!]]
[[Image:Rootbrianthequeer.png|thumb|right|500px|Typical responses to one of his videos.]]
[[Image:Middle_class.png|thumb|right|350px|Typical Rootbrian lie.]]
*Makes videos on 3 subjects exclusively: 
#Crying about [[trolls]].
#Destroying his [[mother]]'s microwave by nuking random household objects.
#Whining about non-existent [[censorship]] of his channel and [[Google]] (whilst his channel is fully RID enabled of course).
*He spends most of the day "napping" for 5-14 hours at a time.
*Foolishly responds to hate comments, leading to an increase in his hate "following"
*One of YouTube's most well known pathological [[liar]]s.  Can be caught, at any given time, lying his ass off and/or backpedalling about almost anything whatsoever.  
*His [[mom]] has seen his article.
*Rootbrian surprisingly has a [http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1587416011 girlfriend],She lives in Wigan,United Kingdom while Brian lives in Toronto,Canada. Rootbrian says he can't put any pictures up of them together <s> because he doesn't have her permission to do so. </s>  because previous comments on [http://www.facebook.com/Korally?ref=ts her] facebook have led us to believe that she is, infact, a faggot who wants to see his pen0r  '''LOLWUT?''' 
*Has openly consorted with and supported [[YTV]] and [[Logansperman2]], [[Irish282]] and [[Dynacatlovesme]].  
*His brother was revealed to be '''[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=183_1244449142 even more IRL retarded than he is]''' in a video Brian uploaded where his brother spoke in [[Hurr|slurred]] mongoloid speech-patterns and [[lulz|picked his nose and ate it]]. Despite this, his brother still '''has a job, a girlfriend, and dresses better than Brian'''. 
*[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=87d_1244449291 Uses a cane to walk]. Lol crippled.
*Got owned by [[totse]] when he flamed various users in one of his fits of aspie [[rage]].  
*Has shown to be demonstrably [[bipolar|passive-aggressive]] in his responses to [[trolls]], he will often be completely [[pussy|affable]] one day, then the next a [[ITG|full blown retard]] (although most often full blown retard).  Tends to [[E-psychiatry|suggest]] he has [[obvious|emotional issues]] most [[basement dwellers|shut-ins]] acquire from years of [[anti-social]] behavior and neglect.  
*His "{{youtube2|DaSourLemons|musician}}" channel links to [http://www.keystothestudio.com/ keystothestudio.com] - a website for "[[Asperger's Syndrome|people diagnosed with developmental and intellectual disabilities]]".  Needs investigating...  
*It's suspected that Brian's mom loaned him out for medical experimentation when he was a baby to get crack money. Most of the experimental drugs themselves were likely harmless in the long term, but many of them involved injections which contained a mercury preservative, which is a likely cause of his severely stunted mental development. This was only compounded by the excessive exposure to close range microwave tampering which came in the following years of his life, starting at childhood. At this point, due to these combined factors, he is pretty much a brainless meat puppet, unable to process any information beyond the level of an infant.  
*Some of his videos feature a faint crinkle noise, or a rustling plastic sound. The reason for this is most likely that Brian was never trained to use the toilet, and even though he's in his mid-20s, he still wears a diaper. When welfare is low, he sometimes just sits on a garbage bag without pants, to preserve the Huggies supply.
*A fan of [[lolsuits]].  Has filed [[DMCA]]'s all over YouTube.  
*Sounds remarkably like [[Jawsus]] when he speaks.  
*Supposedly lost his tooth in a car accident.  
*Made claims that he was going to be getting [[tranny|married]].  
*In a call, he shouted for his <s>brother</s> <s>Dad</s> husband and asked him to call the [[police]].  Is he gay?  
*Even [[TehBigToaster]] and [[BodyXPolitic]] think he's retarded.
*His "friends" can open a [[command prompt]].  
*Has suffered permanent brain damage from his microwave experiments.
*Was kicked out of a Rogers Cable store for being a retard and attempting to troll the sales reps working. Then went onto Daily Motion and bawwed about it, claiming ot to be epic [[win]]. [http://www.dailymotion.com/user/Rootbrian/video/xaau7j_rogers-guy-gets-all-nasty-and-agres_shortfilms Watch it here].
*Is 5'4", 24 years old, [[unemployed]], and lives at home with his mother at 190 Woolner Ave 4th floor, M6N1Y3, in a [[buttsecks|shared]] room with his [[ass rape|brother]] in Toronto, Canada.  He's a [[power-bottom|top]], who'd have thought?
*Openly <s>{{youtube|E8kA_ITU4r8|admits having a 3 inch penis}}. No, SRSLY.</s> BALEETED
*His real name is Brian "Root" Collinge.
*Is a butthurt faggot that baws about this very article, and creates sock accounts to edit it in his favor.
*In [[poor|debt]] and wish he could afford a bike.
*Got butthurt from JewTube user 'RootmomIsComin4u' re-posting his videos and adding in humourous annotations and had them tos'd.
*Is African American.
*Bawwed and decided to set his worthless videos to 'subscribers only' because of all the hate and trolling he received. 
*Hangs around in a lesbian bar called [http://www.slacks.ca "Slacks"]. See one of his videos of the establishment [http://www.youtube.com/user/rootbrianrocks#p/u/23/lc0w40zTl6I here]. "This predominantly lesbian hangout bypasses grunge in favour of subtle swank, while gently twinkling tea lights add a touch of romance." Is Rootmom a lesbian? Or does Rootbrian fail at picking up chicks? You be the judge.
*Rootbrian tried to ddos youtube but failed. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBjhu72bqdM]
*Is a pedophile and admits it [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QypQ7JG9oI here.]
*His Facebook relationship status is "In a Relationship" (Hand doesn't count amirite?)
*After abusing his Blackberry for months, Brian was surprised that it no longer works.
*Brags about installing a ten year old [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6CDTZYrqNc nVidia tnt2 video card] into his piece of shit computer.
*The Game.
*Spends a majority of his welfare money on obsolete computer equipment.
*Roots through the garbage of supermarkets and restaurants for food.
*Cried to the admin of MemeGenerator over major butthurt and had his image taken down.
*Was beaten up constantly on his bus when he was in school. Had to change school buses 24 times in grade 5 because of all the bullies. Even as a little kid, people hated this faggot.
*Kids threw rocks at him because they didn't want him around. Now they throw rocks at him because he's a [[pedophile]].
