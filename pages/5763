[[Image:Why 2.jpg|right]]

Nicole Strojek is a chubby chasing fail [[cosplay|cosplayer]] from the Land of Down Under. She is most well known for her poorly constructed costumes, terrible dress sense and being the girlfriend/money bag/whale lover of the infamous Aoyagi-Seimei.

Nicole popped up on the Ausfalia cosplay scene in 2008, but no one gave a shit about her until 2010 when she started dating WCS winner Cattypatra. She used her to get attention and make fake, backstabbing friends before her girlfriend saw the light and dumped that dumb goth bull dyke for Dean Winchester. The fact that Cattypatra dated her in the first place means that she's pretty fucking stupid, but at least she retained an iota of intelligence and got the fuck out.

Her alias on ED is Whiteknight666 and she likes to go around editing the article of her beloved Aoyagi-Seimei and removing her personal details. Maybe she shouldn't have dated such a drama whore and she wouldn't have had these problems in the first place.

==Mystery Illness==

To top off her victim complex, Nicole has a [[Aids|mystery illness]]! She claims that she has stomach ulcers, but even that can't explain her whiny ass temperament and bad attitude. She even got an operation to fix her stomach ulcers of epic fail, but of course, because she is a drama whoring freak they come back whenever someone upsets her. Her most common explanation of why she has stomach ulcers is that she is so anxious about her ex not giving back two of her DVD's that it makes her extremely ill and puts her in the hospital. 

Now Aoyagi-Seimei gets to deal with this epic fail. These two [[fail|lovely]] people are perfect for each other. Maybe if they're together and in the same place long enough they'll be easier to dispose of. Thought it's unlikely because Lily's folds of fat would protect Nicole from the all the bombs.

==The Friendship Cycle==

Nicole is very good at making friends, and losing them. She desperately goes from group to group, craving acceptance, before back stabbing everyone, torturing them mentally and fucking them over. She then baaaaws about how she's the victim and moves on to find more people to mooch off emotionally. She has an extensive list of victims which range from ex-girlfriends to her so-called 'friends'.

This is proven by the fact that many people who she believes to be her [[haters|friends]] all banded together to tell the truth in this article.

=Drama=

There is no beginning or end to the drama that is Nicole. It is a part of her physical make up. Heart, DRAMA, brain, DRAMA, legs, DRAMA, you get the idea. That and her lack of grammar, a la weeaboo.

{{quote|Not only do I have a lot of work I want out of the way for next year, but I seem to be getting roped into more and more drama that I can’t handle.........

I’m still quite sick and my body can’t take this stress……….. I never did anything to hurt anyone, and the people that know me only know I do one thing in my life and that is Cosplay…….. besides that I have nothing else……….

All I wanted to do was keep everyone happy, to keep drama away from my friends and have no one crying or upset but it seems it’s my turn to be the one whose upset and crying.

I don’t want anything from anyone I just need to disappear from people and from the Cosplay community until things are sorted……… I just can’t seem to get it right no matter what I do so I’m outta of it.|Nicole's Journal}}

Yet another piece of shining wisdom from Nicole's journal, this time defending her failwhale girlfriend Lily.

{{quote|I was not going to make this personal but now I have to address this..... Kris, if you want to put a gun to anyones head to blame for all this, point it souly at me...... my gf did nothing wrong, you once protected me the same way she does now, why did the tables turn so much and for what?? Leave her out of this, go start a 4chan thread about me or something but everyone else doesn't need to be slanndered nor involved and if you put her in danger because your angry and stupid, then we will have more than a photoshopping probelm........ YOU DONT REALISE THE DANGER YOU ARE PUTTING HER IN SO LEAVE IT ALONE!!!|Nicole's Journal}}

=The Fail of Gaga Shoot=

[[Image:This is not gaga 2.jpg|right]]

During the relationship of fail with Cattypatra, the bull dyke became obsessed with one Lady Gaga. So what does this Ausfail cosplayer do? She goes and organizes a Lady Gaga photoshoot. With KrisEz as the photographer, nothing was bound to go wrong...until her girlfriend pulled out of the photoshoot because she knew it was a huge cluster fuck.

Since Nicole isn't one to avoid drama, she immediately started kicking up a stink about losing one of the most "important" parts of the photoshoot. Of course, Nicole is skilled at using people and Catty's place in the photoshoot was quickly replaced by a relatively unknown cosplayer.

Graciously, Catty was a good sport, providing Nicole with a majority of the accessories needed for the photoshoot. But Nicole just wasn't satisfied; she ordered one of her "friends" to pick up the stuff from Catty because Nicole was just so furious and then, upon the stark realization that there wasn't a certain Lady Gaga wig, Nicole made several, hate filled phone calls to Catty before ordering her "friend" to go to Catty's house and search for the wig- the minion graciously did as ordered and the Gaga wig was procured.

The results were FAIL. If Lady Gaga saw them, she would probably vomit and claw her eyes
out. The theme "Bad Romance" didn't apply at all and despite the fact that all the girls
spraweled around Nicole, made her look more attractive- SHE WAS NOT EVEN REMOTELY LIKE 
LADY GAGA. 

=The KrisEz Drama=

We all know that Kris is a faggot- but what a lot of people wonder is why he put up with Nicole's stupid antics for as long as he did. There's a lot of speculation he was trying to fuck her- because fucking a lesbian is really cool, but there's more speculation that he was just dumb.

For a long time he was Nicole's personal White-Knight and savior, much as she is for Lily now. He even went as far as sending her a huge bouquet of roses to her workplace when she was feeling sad. In typical lesbian bull dyke fashion she gave the roses to a co-worker, screamed rape and rang her girlfriend in tears. Ungrateful cow.

Finally, the douchebag woke up to himself however after the drama following Nicole's "Petshop of Horrors" photoshoot; most commonly known as the "Petshop of Fail". Looking from the outside in, it seems like it was a general misunderstanding, but Nicole's love of drama,combined with her land-whale of a girlfriend, Lily- turned a molehill into a mountain.
 
A photograph from the shoot was taken and photoshopped by one Fluffy- Kris didn't like this, instead of taking the photograph down- Nicole refused to take it down off of her deviantART prompting Kris to threaten with legal action. Lily then stuck her big fat, pointy nose 
where it didn't belong and made things even worse- Nicole didn't give a shit though- BECAUSE
IF YOU THREATEN LILY THEN SHE'S GONNA COME AFTER YOU.

4chan's /CGL/ board was bombarded with [more] threads about Lily and her fuckwit girlfriend as well as about Kris. Currently, Kris has removed all matierial from his deviantART and makes all of his clients sign Model Release forms- cosplayers, the bulldyke is the reason why you now have to pay for a photoshoot with the infamous Kris; because Nicole and her landwhale of a girlfriend couldn't keep their mouths shut and do what they're told.
