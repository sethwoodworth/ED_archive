The finest example of [[YouTube]] [[fail]] [[evar]], '''I Like Turtles''' became [[old meme]] from the very moment it was created. It centers around Jonathon Ware, (future President of the United States) a [[13 year old boy|10 year old child]] dressed as a [[zombie]] being interviewed at [[Portland]]'s Waterfront Park by KGW News. When asked about his costume, he looks into the camera and mutters the following [[retarded]] words that are now a household [[catchphrase]] of the [[internets]]; "I like turtles." This meme apparently caught on with people on <strike>[[4chan]],</strike> [[YTMND]] <strike>& [[Something Awful]]</strike>, who've now made their own little spinoffs and cross-memes of it.

The following examples are just a few of literally hundreds of I Like Turtle parodies, and each individual video is a prime example of  [[old meme]], [[trying too hard]], and [[doing it wrong]].
