You know that sinking feeling in your stomach when you made someone cry [[on the Internet]] [[virgin|for the first time?]] Do you experience guilt and other [[emo]] [[fgt]] emotions after an epic troll?

This is the medical condition known as '''Troll's Remorse.'''

You may also experience Troll's Remorse when you are caught by [[LJ Abuse]] and [[Banned|lose your paid account]].
Other cases, though not frequent, occur when something [[epic]] happens to someone who doesn't deserve it. As stated, this rarely happens because [[asking for it|everyone fucking deserves it]].

== Common Mistakes ==

* If you are feeling Troll's Remorse, '''do not''', under any circumstances, apologize.
* If you begin to feel Troll's Remorse set in, do not tell anyone, or else you will instantly be branded a [[pussy]] and lose your hard-earned [[respect|internet cred]].
* Make sure you close yourself off from the outside world and pretend you're a villain and not just some [[fat]] pussy.

== Treatment ==

* Saying "[[I did it for the lulz]]" three times instantly clears all guilt.
* [[Cut]] the remorse away.
* View the [[Offended?]] page until you feel cleansed.
* Focus on the fact that your victim [[asking for it|brought it on themselves]] by caring about something on the [[internets]], and is probably a [[furfag]]. 
* Moar [[troll]]ing.
* Get a new account: no one has to know it was you.
* Tell their family it was a good thing they commited [[suicide]] because they would have died of [[AIDS]] anyhow.

== Triggers ==

Some common TR [[trigger]]s include:
* [[My mom just died]].
* I have [[AIDS]] (or other [[terminal]] illness). In this case, switch immediately to [[pool's closed|POOL'S CLOSED]] routines.
* But, I ''am'' in a wheel[[chair]]. (Weak troll.)
* [[Raid Backfire]].
* [[Noone]] likes me! (Note: This trigger officially certifies you as a [[faggot]].)
* [[Niggers]] are people too!(If you are a candy-ass [[faggot]] [[troll]])
