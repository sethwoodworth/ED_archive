[[Image:Trigger isnt gay.jpg|thumb|[[furfag|Trigger]] isn't gay cause its not his [[fursona|character.]]]]
With a group of social rejects and society's outcasts; you will always get a mixture of all the cliques of a high school. Though most furries land in the "loner" or "[[fat]]" categories like [[you]], and there is a never-ending amount of [[lulz]] to be had from those of them that pretend they aren't. '''Trigger Fox''' ([[Powerword|also known as]] '''Torrey''' from Clermont, [[Florida]]) is the prime example of [[hypocrisy]] and furfaggotry in these groups. Not only that, but he attempts to act like a [[douchebag|bro]] to mask his homosexuality. In addition to being a total [[closet]] case, he also [[fursuit]]s and goes to as many furry [[convention]]s as possible.

==The Past== 
[[Image:TriggerOzGay.jpg|thumb|[[lie|Totally not gay.]]]]
[[At least 100 years ago]], Trigger was involved in a very [[gay]] relationship with Oz Kangaroo, another furry in [[Australia]]. The relationship lasted for quite a while as far as furries go, until Trigger's masculinity was [[Rape|stripped from him]]. While attending [[college]], his bros found gay furry [[porn]] of him and his [[Online dating|e-boyfriend]] on his computer. In return 100 CCs of bro rape were injected into his [[Ego|ass]]. With a [[butthurt|sore ass]], he was "forced" to move to convince his daddy to pay for a different college in order to hide his homolove for Oz. With this move, Trigger proceeded to [[delete fucking everything]] that ever related to him or Oz, as well as deny that entire period of his life. In doing this, he became the biggest [[pussy]] in the fandom. With his secrets buried, he grew in popularity among [[furries|the rejects of society]] using his whiny journals and ultimatum opinions. Currently he has been putting on [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1218062/ weight], complaining about [[fursuit|fursuit sex]] and the fandom in general.

He has made [[over 9000]] journal entries, many of them made in [[asspie|small faggoty bursts]]. They can easily be divided into 3 categories, those being him [[fap|admiring]] a [[Jewtube]] or [[Newgrounds]] [[flash]], something about something he did while dressed up in his [[otherkin|fox/wolf/dragon hybrid]] suit, or him bitching about how much [[irony|he hates furries everywhere]].

==The present==
[[Image:Triggerfox_trigwip.jpg|thumb|[[Denial]]]]
[[Image:OceanFurry.jpg|thumb|left|Nothing like the feeling of fresh seawater seeping in through the feet of your [[fursuit]]]]
Currently, Trigger lurks on [[FurAffinity]], trying to [[troll|pick fights]] and [[unwarranted self-importance|assert himself above the rest]]. When called out or criticized, he will proceed to [[BAWW|baww]] and use his [[fanboy]]s to defend himself. He is still very [[butthurt|sensitive]] about Oz. He also hasn't been able to hold down a successful relationship since Oz, since [[gay|he doesn't know how to handle a woman]] and desires [[cock]]. Even though his gay love for Oz remains, the desire to get nailed by a T-rex remains the main objective in his [[no life|life]].

[[File:TriggerDrunk.gif|right|thumb|Trigger follows in the footsteps of many [[closet]]ed [[homosexuals]] before him and becomes an [[alcoholic]]]]
His current hobbies include [[alcoholic|drinking himself into a coma on a regular basis]] (preferably while wearing a fursuit), making [[at least 100]] journal posts a day so that his [[retards|loyal fans]] can stroke his [[emo|ego]] til he can get off (preferably while wearing a fursuit), walking around town or taking long walks on the beach (in a fursuit) and [[BAWW|bawwwwwwwing]] to everybody and furry he can about how furries suck [[copypasta|(in a fursuit)]]. He also enjoys taking pictures of himself in his fursuit, then posting the same image 10 times so his [[zombies|fans]] can [[fap|praise]] how [[shit|good]] it looks.

But remember kids, the fursuit thing is [[bullshit|NOT SEXUAL]] for him.

===The closet fox and the [[insane|mad]] fursuit maker===

{{main|LatinVixen}}

[[File:TriggerPimp.jpg|right|thumb|Yes, yes, we get it. You're kind of a [[loser|big deal]] with the [[gay boys|ladies]]]]
He is currently shacking up with [[LatinVixen]] in an attempt to prove to [[Internet|everyone]] and himself that he doesn't really want [[cock|it]] stuck in his [[pooper]]. This, however, is [[nice try|not working]] because the [[Internet]] never forgets. LatinVixen is either stupid or [[desperate]] to accept such a raging closet fag as a boyfriend. [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|Informed observers]] are currently taking bets as to when the [[truth|rumors]] of a [[cocksucking rampage]] involving Trigger surface. Check the next furry convention for details!

The jury is currently out on whether or not Trigger has a [[job]], since looking at his [[Twitter]] account, we see that he often updates into the early morning hours and then doesn't re-appear until 4-5PM or later. If he is in fact [[unemployed]], LatinVixen is even more of a retard for letting someone [[gay|not enamored with her kind]] drain her [[money|bank account]] of those blingy [[fursuit]]-makin' dollaz.

Shortly after this section was written, Trigger [[friends only|protected]] his [[Twitter]] account, telling us that in fact he is watching this page.

==Fetishes and other secrets==
[[Image:Triggerinflation.jpg|thumb|That's a huge bitch]]
[[Image:Trig&oz love.png|thumb|an example of Trigger and Oz's faggotry]]
Because of his relationship with Oz, Trigger developed an [[inflation]] fetish, which resulted in many pictures of Oz filling him with hot air. There is also the rumor of his deep love for a cartoon T-rex. This most likely is suppressed zoophilia instincts that most furries have. It also shows us that despite his attempts at being the essence of manliness, in reality he's just a big huge [[bottom]] bitch.  This all just proves the fact that he's merely a fine, upstanding [[Guido|citizen]].

He also has a [[boner]] for [http://trigger-fox.deviantart.com/journal/10890431/ Robin from Disney's Robin Hood].

===But wait, there's [[moar]]?===

[[TL;DR]]: Based on [[facts]] and [[Phoenix Wright|irrefutable evidence]], there must have been some sort of [[huge|hueg]] pile of furfaggotry that was unrelated to Oz.

* The whole Oz drama was occurred sometime in 2008
* His oldest journal entry dates back only 8 months ago
* Got [[butthurt]] when he found out his fursuit was initially competing against Oz.  [[Drama|Politely asked]] for his nomination to be withdrawn.  [[http://community.livejournal.com/fursuittourney/64545.html?thread=1712161#t1712161 Him asking to be dropped]]

{{quote|"A LONG ASS time ago (try 5 years now) I joined this fandom."|Trigger is an [[oldfag]], from his [http://ftrig.livejournal.com/22107.html LiveJournal]}} 

This little blurb was pulled from his [[LiveJournal]], and yet when we look through his submissions, the most recently submitted pic of Trigger and Oz was submitted February 27th, 2008. Whats more, on September 15th, 2008 trigger made a very [[emo|deep]] and [[Shit nobody cares about|meaningful]] picture of him [[Bawwwww|expressing loneliness]]. This would mean that they broke up somewhere between february and september of 2008. His oldest journal entry on FurAffinity dates back to 8 months ago, and is at the time of writing about "160 [[comments]] on my last journal!!". This suggests that there was some other mind-shattering pile of furfaggotry and drama which caused him to [[delete fucking everything|accidentially the whole internets]] since Oz.

===The [[denial]] continues===

Not too long ago, in another attempt to disprove his own homosexuality, Trigger went out with [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/jannali/ Jannali], but all traces of their relationship have been cleaned from both of their FA accounts. Her gallery is completely deleted. Maybe she got scared off by his faggotry.
Evidence of his short lived, failed attempt at redemption can be found [http://jannali.deviantart.com/art/You-make-me-happy-117533675 here]. Janalli was also kind enough to make him a [http://jannali.deviantart.com/art/Trigger-Plushie-123621730 plushie fuck toy] of himself, of which he [[lie|does not]] use in any disgusting homosexual furfag manner.

===Another [[Female]] Victim?===

Trigger's moving on to his next victim. [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/remywolf/ Remy Wolf]  Another decent looking female furry in the fandom that Trigger will eventually drag through the mud in trade for making him look straight.  We all know girls like the bad boy jock douche bag. The question is; how far will Remy Wolf go with him until he has bled her dry emotionally like he did orally with [[OzKangaroo]]

Encase you would like to [[white knight]] Remy and contact her. She's conveniently placed her info on her [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/remywolf/ FA]
