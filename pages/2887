Fate/stay night
[[File:FateStayNight.png|thumb|Press Start.]]

'''Fate/stay night''' is a visual novel by Type-Moon. Since it was created by the same people responsible for [[Tsukihime]], this game was bond to /b/loved and cherished by channers. In this visual novel, heroes don't die; instead, they become otherworldly Servants bond to magicians (some trade-off). Masters and their Servants must fight against other magicians and their pets in order to [[win]] the ultimate prize: the [[Holy Grail]] ([[srsly]]). The game is divided into three story arcs or routes: ''Fate'', ''Unlimited Blade Works'', and ''Heaven's Feel''. Oh, and Saber is the female King Arthur.

==GAR==
[[File:GarVsNotGar.png|thumb|Simply explained.]]
<div style="overflow:auto;">{{Main|GAR}}</div>

'''GAR''' is an adjective used to describe beings of extreme manliness. GAR was created by an anon expressing his fondness of Archer. As with many do with [[Bridget]], this person was "Gay for Archer", but he [[typo|mistyped]] and accidentally submitted "I'm gar for archer". 

==Unlimited X Works==
As with GAR, this meme is also based on Archer. Archer is a [[Trace|tracer]] with the ability to [[Art theft|copy many weapons]]. As a result, Archer can create an ''unlimited'' amount of copies in order to deliver [[pwnage]] to his opponents. Archer's Reality Marble (special ability) is '''Unlimited Blade Works''', which he used to create any weapon he wishes. Archer also has a neat, little chant that is often used as an [[exploitable]] [[copypasta]]:

<pre style="overflow:auto;">
I am the bone of my sword.
Steel is my body, and fire is my blood.
I have created over a thousand blades.
Unknown to death.
Nor known to life.
Have withstood pain to create many weapons.
Yet, those hands will never hold anything.
So as I pray, "Unlimited Blade Works".
</pre>

Besides a copypasta, Unlimited X Works can be used in image form, in which the creative image editor must replace the "X" with [[Original content|sometime new and interesting]].

==Gilgamesh==
'''[[Gilgamesh]]''' is the [[unwarranted self-importance|King of Heroes]] and the jerk amongst the Servants. He's an antagonist in two story arcs, and he often attempted hits on Saber. Gilgamesh can open [[portal]]s (via '''Gate of Babylon''') and retrieve legendary weapons from an [[Fallout|ancient vault]]. As with Unlimited X Works, this is often the subject of image modifications.

==Fall/semester mike==
[[File:UnlimitedEssayWorks.png|thumb|Unlimited Essay Works.]]

'''Fall/semester mike''' (aka '''Unlimited Essay Works''') is a spin-off of Unlimited X Works. An anon on [[A/|/a/]] named "Mike" was failing his English course, so he decided to go out with a bang. Instead of handing in his final paper, he handed in Unlimited Essay Works:

<pre style="overflow:auto;">
I am the bone of my essay.
Procrastination is my body, and caffeine is my blood.
I have ignored over a thousand deadlines.
Unknown to MLA format, nor known to passing grades.
Have withstood responsibility to fail many classes.
Yet those classes will﻿ never teach anything.
So, I hand in, UNLIMITED ESSAY WORKS.
</pre>

Mike's teacher wasn't amused (partly because she or he hadn't played ''Fate/stay night''), so she or he gave Mike an D+ and failed him:

<pre style="overflow:auto;">
Did you mean 'bane'?

:(

Most creative way I've seen to fail my class. I hope see you in Fall semester, Mike.

Overall Grade: F
</pre>

Mike uploaded the essay onto /a/. Unlike the teacher, /a/ was amused by the essay and deemed it [[A++]].

==People die if they are killed==
'''People die if they are killed''' is a phrase from the ''Fate/stay night'' [[anime]]. Due to the obviousness of this phrase (Killed = Die), the phrase has been parodied and used as a sort of "no duh" reply.

==Jam It In==
<div style="overflow:auto;">{{Main|Jam It In}}</div>

'''Jam in it''' is a chan meme from a ''Fate/stay night'' doujin entitled ''Platonic Magician H'' ([http://www.fakku.net/viewonline.php?id=2534 available for viewing here]). In this work, Saber needs to replenish her magic powers. Being a [[hentai]], it isn't surprising that this must be done via [[sex]]. Unfortunately, Saber's Master Shirou [[Virgin|doesn't know how to have sex]]. Saber then gives him the following instructions on how to do it (but you're better off [[:File:Jam-it-in.jpg|viewing this file]]):

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">Please put your… That! Your ponos! Here! …My vagoo. And '''J… J… JAM IT IN!'''</blockquote>

This meme spread throughout /a/ and the other boards.

==…You lost me==
[[File:YouLostMe.png|thumb|…You lost me]]

'''…You lost me''' is a meme that spun off of Jam It In. It originates from a fan tribute comic created by the meme-loving [[weeaboo]] known as [http://veloxiraptor.deviantart.com/ Veloxiraptor] (the [http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs11/i/2006/215/6/5/Wouldja_Like_Some_Making_F_____by_veloxiraptor.jpg comic can be viewed here]). In this fan comic, Rin attempts to teach Shirou how to have sex with Saber. She writes the following onto the chalkboard:

<pre style="overflow:auto;">
Mana Restoration for Retards!

8=D --> (())

 A       B

1) Put pOnOs (A) to vagOOO (B).
2) JAM IT IN!
3) ????
4) PROFIT!
</pre>

Unfortunately, Shirou still doesn't understand and says, ''…You lost me''. This image is generally used as a reply to any user asking for sympathy or understanding.
