Cyndre/MySpace Adventure
'''[[Cyndre]]''', best known for his quote, "I want to kill one million jews", is actually a pretty big advocate of social networking site [[MySpace]].  Every week or so he sends me the latest screenshots of his pro-[[Nazi]] and [[JEWS DID WTC]] propaganda.  I didn't expect him to be a Class A [[troll]], but hey, the [[moar]] [[you]] know, rite? [[lol]], [[dunnage]]. His [[Myspace Adventure]] is hosted at [http://www.myspace.com/cyndre myspace.com/cyndre], and if you think any of this is even one bit funny, go kill yourself, you insensitive fuck.

== The Literature ==
''Heh, it's not so often I find a woman so beautiful. You are a beautiful woman. You look like your so smart. I hardly know you, except from your little myspace page.''

''Just from your picture, I view you as a girl mistaken, a girl who is pure, and innocent. A woman who sometimes can be misunderstood. I wish I could reach out, have you rest aside me as I comfort you in person, my warm hands would caress cheeks, your stomach, your breast, and my arm would then lie between them as I breath onto your neck. I kiss your neck, I lightly suck on your soft flesh, as you float away. I want your pain to go away. I want you to be a free woman, I want to empower you. I want to see you embrace the beauty of life, and not be hurt by others. I want you to feel ravished under the weight of my hands.''

''God you're so beautiful.. Please, I've been viewing your myspace for the last 3 months and I can't take it anymore. I love you.''

''Your favorite bands, Your Interests, Your favorite movies, all of them are so perfect. You're such a unique snow flake. I care about you. You are a gentle person, don't be afraid to open yourself up to me. We can be great together.''
