Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines
The rules of the [[cosplay|robo]][[Bureaucratic_fuck|bureaucracy]] at [[Wikipedia]] are known as the '''Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines'''. The Policies can be freely ignored by any sysop, while the Guidelines can be disregarded by a normal editor as long as you have [[Gary Weiss|friends in high places]].
This [[article]] will discuss a few of them.

==How Misinformation Gets Spread==
:''Note: This is only a Guideline.''
#People, over a period ranging from minutes to years, add useful content to an article.
#Prima adds misinformation, or reverts a useful edit.
#A revert war starts between Secunda (who actually knows the truth) and Prima.  Often it's just two people and hundreds of sock puppets.
#Surprise, Prima is an admin! Prima bans anyone who disagrees with them. The lies spread.
#Prima gets bored and tries to add jokes to the article, like this hilarious classic, "A ''small'' sub-set of the [[furry]] fandom does consider a [[fursuit]] a sexual item."  HAHAHA It's [[unfunny|funny]], because it's actually 100% of them.
#[[????]]
#[[Profit]]!

==[[Wikipedia:WP:5P|The Pillars of Wikipedia]]==
The Pillars of Wikipedia are proof that all Wikipedos are [[Muslim]]s and terrorists who need to be shot.

The first pillar of Wikipedia is Wikipedia's basic definition of the project. As the definition of the project was a definition, there have been many calls for it to be moved over to Wiktionary, which is the [[ghey]]est name for any project ever conceived. The people over at Wiktionary thought that this definition counted as original research and decided to delete it. Therefore, Wikipedia deleted its own definition. All of this could have been avoided had the members of Wikipedia simply [[ignored]] all rules.

I, however, managed to save this definition and found the following startling discovery:
{| class="boilerplate" id="pd" style=" background-color:#9f9f9f; border:2px solid #000000; padding: 0px;" cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0
| <font size=5>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.</font>
|}
Truly genius prose.<br>From this they also logically deduced that '''Wikipedia is not paper'''. This is interesting as these two observations manage to go at each other every single day in [[VFD]]. 
:WikiPrima: "This article is [[uncyclopedia|unencyclopedic]]!"
:WikiSecunda: "Wikipedia is not paper!"

That's really as deep as the argument gets.
{| class="boilerplate" id="pd" style=" background-color:#9f9f9f; border:2px solid #000000; padding: 0px;" cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0
| <font size=5>[[Wikipedia:Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License|Wikipedia is free content.]]</font>
|}
This is the part of Wikipedia that makes it the '''"free"''' encyclopedia. "Free" in this case means "free only to be altered, distributed, copied, cited, and transformed in a way that conforms to the agreement contained in the GNU Free Documentation Licence".

Thank God. Now "the whole of human knowlege" is available to us thanks to our lord Jimbo Wales. Thank you, our Lord, for licensing "the whole of human knowledge" under such a [[Wikipedia:Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License|simple understandable legal licencing agreement]]. We ''know'' there is no ''possible way'' that this is ''EVER'' going to come back to bite us in the ass.

{| class="boilerplate" id="pd" style=" background-color:#9f9f9f; border:2px solid #000000; padding: 0px;" cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0
| <font size=5>[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Writers' rules of engagement|Wikipedia follows the writers' rules of engagement.]]</font>
|}
This supposed to be the simplest policy among Wikipedians. As such, it has become the most difficult. The number of policies that have been taken out of this [[Quasidian's Penis|pillar]] are larger than the number of the policies of any other pillar. As such, Wikipedia did what it always does when it faces instuction creep -- it advances it.

They created three different policy pages that sum up the other policy pages. Often when needing one single place to point to they will point at one of these three.

:[[Wikipedia:Civility|Civility]]. Civility is when you put on a happy face and pretend that someone else isn't being an asshole acting in bad faith.

:[[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|Assume good faith]]. Assume good faith is when you put on a happy face and pretend that someone else isn't being an asshole acting in bad faith.

:[[Metawikipedia:Don't be a dick|Don't be a dick]]. Don't be a dick is not a policy created by Wikipedia but instead is located at Meta-wiki. Recently, it underwent a VFD. That's right. Somebody, apparently, would like the right to be a dick on Wikimedia projects. 
{| class="boilerplate" id="pd" style=" background-color:#9f9f9f; border:2px solid #000000; padding: 0px;" cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0
| <font size=5>[[Wikipedia:WP:NPOV|Wikipedia uses the "neutral point-of-view."]]</font>
|}
This is their biggest [[trap|lie]] and this should be renamed "Wikipedia Sysops' POV". For ED's policy on NPOV, click [[NPOV|here]].

===The real pillar of Wikipedia===
Wikipedia has one basic rule:
{| class="boilerplate" id="pd" style=" background-color:#9f9f9f; border:2px solid #000000; padding: 0px;" cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0
|<font size=5>[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Ignore_all_rules|Ignore all rules.]]</font>
|}
All of the other rules have been painstakingly logically extracted from this basic idea. How the hell they managed to pull it off, no one knows, but it's true. On Wikipedia, [[Vandalize|you should ignore all rules]].

==WP:VFD==
:''Main article: [[VFD]]''
A VFD is the process by which articles on Wikipedia are deleted. [[Sarcasm|Thankfully, like all Wikipedia rules, it was carefully planned and written so it is not rampantly abused.]]

==WP:VAND==
An utterly [[fucktard]]ed Wikipedia guideline that doesn't mean shit - just like every single other guideline. The [[admin]]s don't seem to understand it.

==WP:NPA==
Oh, look! A Wikipedo guideline that ''isn't'' ever given any thought or attention! '''Isn't that new?''' Essentially, WP:NPA is an [[Shit|accepted guideline]] that outlines [[Internet lawsuit|why personal attacks are bad]], and what a personal attack is considered to be on [[TOW]]. On TOW, a personal attack is considered to be:

*Disagreeing with [[Tony Sidaway]]
*Disagreeing with [[MONGO]]
*Not being Jew
*Voicing an opinion

Any of the above things are grounds for an [[A winner is you|insta-ban]]. DON'T DO IT (unless you are a [[funny|troll]]) OTHERWISE YOU WILL REGRET IT (unless you are a [[funny|troll]], where you'll just lol).

==WP:NOR==
:''Main article: [[Original research]]''
A policy that says you must [[Citation needed|cite]] that the sky is blue, this policy page is also the private fiefdom of the notorious [[SlimVirgin]] and her cronies.
