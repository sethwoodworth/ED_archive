Fursecution
[[image:furry-jail.jpg|thumb|Put 'em in a zoo.]]

Fursecution is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[furry]]" and "persecution", used by [[sick fucks]] who dress up in animal suits, to describe the discrimination they face for being [[Gay|"different"]]. All furries at some point will claim to have been fursecuted, and they're probably right, since everyone, everywhere hates furries.

A favorite target of [[Dramacrats]] everywhere, furries are well known for providing buttloads of [[lulz]] by, for example, comparing the fursecution they receive to the [[Holocaust]]. All furries are filled with [[Hitler|self-righteous anger]] and overwhelming angst, which makes persecuting them even easier.

The proper technique for trolling furries is claiming that your [[fursona]] is a black person.

:'''[[Mundane]]''': ''"I hate to ask, but could you remove your ears, please?  I can't see the film."''<br/>
:'''[[Furry]]''': ''"[[OMG]] remove my ears!  They are a part of me, you insensitive asshole! FURSECUTION!"''

==The origins of fursecution==
{{squote|[F]urries get so fucking defensive of that shit, dude, because they '''know''' it's pathetic and they're holding on to that last vestige of their [[lie|delusion that they aren't less-than]] in order to maintain some kind of emotional equilibrium.  If that hold breaks, you know they're going to [[an hero]].  Seeing people [[troll|call that shit what it is]] validates [[dying alone|what their subconscious already knows]]: that they're fucking sad sacks.  That kind of self-admission would just be way too much for them to bear.|anon, waxing psychological about why furfags get so butthurt about fursecution}}

[[Image:Fursecution.jpg|thumb|[[DAMN NIGGA]]]]
[[Image:Furries fight humans.jpg|thumb|Humans and furries have battled like this since [[At least 100 years ago|prehistoric times.]]]]


[[Furry|Furries]] brought the hate of the [[Internets]] on themselves. The large majority of furries consider their fandom a "lifestyle". Because of this, no matter how politely you tell a furry that you don't want to hear about their preoccupation with animal sex, they will get offended and accuse you of fursecuting them and claim that you are an insensitive Nazi. [[Lie|Moar reasonable furries used to exist]], but they went extinct a long time ago. Today, any new furries are quickly scooped up and conditioned by the fascist furry state in control of the fandom.

The spectacular overreactions brought by furries quickly caught the attention of [[troll]]s on the Internets. When some of the moar intellectual trolls dug for moar information to parody their furry targets, they unearthed some genuinely disturbing furry pastimes, such as [[bestiality]], body-alterations, the infamous body-paint leopards, and furries with whiskers surgically implanted in their bodies. Furries also proved to have a far higher incidence of deviant kinks such as [[scat]], hermaphrodite worship and [[pregfur|pregnancy fetishes]], inflation, and a strange preoccupation with erect penises due to their sexual insecurity.

The trolls, realizing they'd hit a goldmine, reported their findings all over furry [[LiveJournal]]s, web [[forum]]s, and anywhere else. However, the reaction from the overly defensive furries was what really nailed their coffins. One after another, (like retarded [[lemmings]]) furries with deviant and disgusting sexual kinks loudly defended their sick "lifestyle". Let us note here that saying a furry lives a lifestyle is like saying MTV still airs music videos. Sure, they still air videos, but mostly on TRL. Plus they only air a few short clips of said videos in favor of showing off their retarded VJs, and entertainment news you can look up on the internet. So essentially the fucked up side of furries is [[over 9000|a hundred]] times bigger then the "lifestyle" part of it.

Of course, all furries are [[hypocrite]]s and have no right to [[BAW|complain]]. Given the opportunity they will readily fursecute one another as they are so disgusting that they invoke revulsion even from others of their kind.  As further proof of their hypocrisy, many of those crying fursecution and calling you a Nazi for making fun of them are also the same ones who created the [[Nazifur]] fetish.

Another example of fursecution is how many furries have been seriously [[butthurt]] by what they perceived to be "negative [[media]] attention" (though they should be glad that their pathetic, perverted, and ridiculous little subculture has actually been seen by a small number of people to be significant enough to receive any media attention at all) by shows like CSI, MTV's Sex2k, articles in magazines like Vanity Fair, and Dan Savage's syndicated column Savage Love.  They whine that these media portrayals of them are "inaccurate" because they focus on the perverse sexual side of the fandom (which, in fact, makes the portrayals accurate as furries are pervs even when they don't admit it).  However, nobody cared what the furries had to say because MTV and CSI are at least popular and liked, whereas furries are not popular or liked by anybody.  Nevertheless, some furfags will make the laughable accusation that you get your information about them from MTV or CSI, when it is in fact common sense telling you that they are sick weird fucks.

[[Image:Sir Blargg L4D Scaled.JPG|thumb|Furries ruin [[Left 4 Dead|everything]].]]

[[Truth|It is absolutely okay for you to hate furries.]] Hell, hatred of furries should be goddamn <i>encouraged</i>. They are whiny, twisted, victim complex asshats who don't know enough to keep their creepy fetish to themselves. We're not saying you should [[DO IT FAGGOT|actively sniff them out and attack them]], because if they are keeping it to themselves then they deserve as much privacy as you do with your BDSM shotacon foot fetish. 

What we're saying is that the next time you see someone wearing part of a fursuit, or defending the furry lifestyle in public, or you find someone who uses a furry last name on face book or some shit (you'll know it when you hear/read it), do the world a favour and shoot them in the fucking face. They deserve it.

You may see tons of [[Sick Fuck|Furry scum]] on [[DA]] whining about ED spreading lies. These bastards only want to pat themselves on the back and convince themselves they are not actually fucked up individuals when they obviously are. Remember kids, every EDiot is here to preserve and document the [[Lie|truth]].

{{bigpic|Furfagsqg9.png|frame|250|The single greatest truth about fursecution. [[Anonymous]] Delivers!}}

'''Some successful fursections include:'''
*The obliteration of [[Dracoguard]].
*The humiliation of [[Poeticirony]].
*The homlessness of [[Allan]]
*The IRL trolling of a furcon by Young Lord Sheppard.

Any furry saying this term in anything resembling a serious tone is usually laughed off the internets and driven to [[suicide]].

==[[IRL]] [[Bullshit|fursecution]]==
==="They fired me because I'm a furry!"===
[[Image:Fursecuution.gif|thumb|An example of [[racist|furcism]].]]
[[Image:Furfags get legioned.jpg|thumb|Anne Frank would be spinning in her grave.]]

Really, now. Let's go down the checklist and see for certain whether it was the fandom's fault: 

*Were you looking at `yiff art', i.e. pictures of animal characters with humanlike mammaries and other reproductive organs at work? Are you aware that people also get fired for looking up pornography at work? 
*Was your bizarre behavior (barking, yelping, walking around on all fours, fursuit wearing, etc.) driving away the company's moar conservative customers, or disrupting the work of other employees? 
*Did you try to explain the fandom to a coworker by showing them `yiff art'? 
*Did you try to download some type of flaky furry related program ([[Furcadia]], MUCK clients, etc.) onto a work computer?
*Did you post your [[dox|resume]] on your furry website only to find out that a [http://friends.portalofevil.com/spshort.php?pi=1000569900&ti=1000569877 search engine ranked it as the top result for your employer's company name]?
*Are you as [[asspie|dumb]] as [[Skylos]] and stored photos of [[zoophilia|you fucking your dog]] on your work computer, accidentally deleted them, and them asked the systems administrator to [http://friends.portalofevil.com/spshort.php?pi=1000569925&ti=1000569877 restore them for you]?

==="They won't hire me because I'm a furry!"===

*Do you behave properly at the interview? (No animal noises or jabbering nonstop about the fandom, etc.) 
*Do you have a presentable resume, one that only includes furry if it has a 100% relationship with the job in question? (Example: Fire fighter&mdash;no furry references are recommended. Furry comic book company&mdash;knock yourself out).
*Did you wear the fursuit to the interview? Hopefully the answer is no.

If you answered yes, here's an idea: if you're worried they won't hire you because you're a furry, 
[[Unrealistic expectations|DON'T TELL THEM YOU'RE A FURRY.]] Short of coming to the interview in a [[fursuit]] or making [[yiff]]ing noises at them, they aren't going to know. Some advice? Leave the damn fursuit at home.

Hide your shame, furries. Gays have been doing it for fucking centuries; figure it out.

==Furry Responses==

Have you ever had an argument with one of these sick fucks? Then you've probably heard any of the following bullshit, flatout '''LIES'''.

* "[[bullshit|Not all furries are sick and rape animals and yiff in fursuits!!]]"
Simply respond saying that they chose to associate themselves with people who have, and are known to do this on a regular basis.
* "[[lolwut|You are putting me down for what I am! You are like a nazi in the holocaust!]]"
This is, once again, bullshit. Making fun of animal fuckers online is not anywhere like the fucking holocaust. Jews were '''killed''' simply because of their religion. In all [[serious business|seriousness]], [[asshole|jews are money grubbing assholes]] and were not even as bad during 1941, but furries rape the fuck out of and jerk off to animals and force other people to know about their sick fuckery [[attention whore|with fursonas, shitty art,]] and descriptions of themselves with: [[retard|"OMG IM BLAK FOX WIT WHITE SPOTS I AM BISEXUAL MY BF IS DARKFOXYFLUFF <3!!!]][[1]]". [[furry|Which of the two is worse?]] Furries get made fun of because they OPENLY set themselves up for such mockery. If a furry ever uses this excuse, not only tell them that making fun of furries is not even fucking [[all caps|COMPARABLE]] to the holocaust, but furries aren't even getting killed, as nice as it would be. For [[lulz]], tell the furry one of your relatives died in the holocaust, and that comparing fursecution to the holocaust makes them a bad person, which it does.
* "[[batshit insane|I will come to your house and kill you!]]"
Tell them this is a perfectly good reason to assume all furries are insane. Challenge this person to come to your house and kill you. Since furries (most furries are [[faggot|male]]) use the terms [[pussy|"wuv" and "huggles"]], it is a perfectly natural to assume they are complete pussies, and would more than likely not even do it, and get their asses handed to them even if they did.
* "[[sick fuck|Looking at furry porn does not make me a bad person!]]"
It's fucking beastiality! [[truth|This is like saying that taking a naked baby, taping a picture of an adult to it's chest and jerking off to it is not pedophilia.]]
* "[[law|You can't tell me what I can and can't do! Freedom of expression!]]"
Likewise, freedom of expression works both ways, meaning we can make fun of furries.

Of course, since it is almost impossible to persuade a furry of their sick ways, having an actual conversation with a furry is near impossible. If you do manage to actually talk sense into a furry [[winner|you deserve 57 virgins, a new car, presidency of the fucking world and the fucking Buddha award.]]

==Anti-fursecution==
[[Image:Bunny Rage.gif|thumb|left|The fursecuted fight back]]
[[Image:Maus_cover.jpg|thumb|left|A tale of [[anti-semitism]], or fursecution?]]

The hatred for furries has only intensified since the inception of the term 'fursecution', prompting some furry groups to continue to escalate the conflict. For example, a group known as [[The Kadaitcha Dancers]] targetted a [[Something Awful]] forum [[goon]] named Sockhead for trolling the LiveJournals of furries. ED is currently lacking an archive of the thread or the emails exchanged between Sockhead, his acquaintances and the psychotic Kadaicha Dancers, but basically the Kadaicha Dancers harassed Sockhead's acquaintances in the hopes of getting enough circumstantial evidence to bring criminal charges of harassment against him. Sockhead, lacking a criminal record and easily coerced friends, quickly found out about the probe and told the Kadaicha Dancers to knock it the hell off, which initially resulted in taunts from the Kadaicha Dancers regarding the charges they asserted they were going to shortly bring against him, curiously capitalizing all of their pronouns and referring to some mysterious 'agent'. How they expected to be taken seriously when saying things like "We have been speaking with Our Agent..." is still under investigation.

The taunts gave way to [[emo]] speeches about how wounds from being insulted on the Internets never went away, and finally a half-assed declaration that [[It was a social experiment|they simply wanted to stir up commotion]] on Something Awful, a community that thrives on such commotion, thus mystifying everyone involved.

There are a few other anti-fursecution incidents like this, all as laughable as the furries themselves.

Fursecution has also given rise to the [[Furluminati]] that spreads propaganda claiming that there aren't homosexual furries and that there's no relation between furries and sex.

===Fursecution.net===

Fail furry site that died way too late. Stole everything they showed and lol'd at even by other furries.</s> LOL BALEETED

===Maus===

*The Pulitzer winning ''Maus'', using storybook cartoon art styles is considered by many to be an [[epic]] achievement in the sequential narrative. The ''Maus'' graphic novels describe in vivid detail the trials and tribulations of a [[Holocaust]] survivor -- and his son's present-day struggle with his sense of identity.

:Naturally, contemporary [[Retards|readers]] regard it as a chronicle of the horrors that fursecution can perpetuate.

==Furpocrisy==
[[Image:Standing Proud.jpg|thumb|[[Fursecution Fox]]]]
The ultimate [[You Win the Prize|goal]] of any furry is to gain [[Circle jerk|social acceptance]] and they will do [[Buttsecks|*ANYTHING*]] to try and get it...even if it means [[raping|stepping on]] their own [[fucktards|kind]].  Make no [[fail|mistake]], there is *NO* difference between a furfag who wears a fur suit and one who doesn't.  There is *NO* difference between a furfag who likes [[Babyfur|cub art]] and a furfag who doesn't.  There is *NO* difference between a furfag who [[traces|draws]] [[fail|furry porn]] from [[Disney|children's cartoons]] and those that only draw [[fail|furry porn]] derived from adult interests.  A furry is a furry, and *ANY* [[fail|attempt]] to [[backpedal|deny]] that fact can be easily identified as an obvious [[nice try|attempt]] to try and gain [[Circle jerk|social acceptance]] by trying to argue [[Shit nobody cares about|inconsequential differences]] in the [[fail|hope]] to garner [[attention|sympathy]].  Essentially saying, "okay I'm [[truth|pathetic]], but I'm not as pathetic as [[lie|*THAT*]]..."  They then seek to [[troll|weasel]] their way onto the side of the [[Basement-dwellers|fursecutors]], [[raping|attacking]] their own kind, much like the [[Self injury|Jewish Nazi]] collaborators of [[World War II]].

== A.N.I.M.A.L.S. ==
[[Image:Furicide.jpg|thumb|Keep pulling and you will soon became [[an hero]].]]


Use the ''A.N.I.M.A.L.S.'' approach should you ever find yourself in the physical vicinity of furries:
#'''A'''pproach with caution, as furries have been known to ''R.O.A.R. ([[Rape]] Often At Random)''; Counter this with a swift kick to the testicles ([[everyone|all furries]] have them, especially since there are [[no girls on the internet|no female ones]]).
#'''N'''ever attempt to start a conversation with a furry; they are [[Aspergers|immune to any form of logic and are deaf to reason]]. Verbal abuse is possible, but do not under any circumstances expect a coherent retaliation.
#'''I'''nteresting people do not exist in the furry fandom, only [[Scientology|fools and the fools who follow them]].
#'''M'''ost furries masturbate to [[yiff|furry porn]]; the rare exception to this is often due to its lack of Internets or some sort of [[lie|self denial]]. However, the furry fandom in general is a sexual [[fetish]] so feel free to make this clear.
#'''A'''lways be prepared to [[Virginia Tech|deal]] with the furry gangup, where a group of furries will converge on the non-believer and proceed to bombard with them with "[[Lie|freedom of expression]]" bullshit.  
#'''L'''ight the fuckers up! If you are arrested for [[Win|attacking a man in a vixen costume]], it will make headlines (not to mention your permanent status as a [[Winnar]]), and we all know that furries and publicity [[do not want|do not mix]].
#'''S'''hout at them. They will lose significant swagger, and if they start yelling back it will be muffled by the retarded mascot head they are wearing and only make the situation more [[lulz|hilarious]].

==Fursecutor's Creed==
{{quote|This is as my Master told it to me and now I tell it thee.

There are a billion names of furfaggotry! A billion kinds of furries that slither and slime and defile the land, sea, and wind. Each furry is a kind of sin spawned by the internet's evil. And that internets is very sinful there are many of these damned furfags and their power is great.

As the purpose of all things in nature is to increase, so it is with the furry. They would we joined them and so they seek to overcome us. In alien forms they assault us. In sleep they come to spread doubt and fear among us. They would corrupt our hearts and see us yiff, too. Trust them not nor suffer them to live.

For each furfag destroyed is a soul freed from eternal bondage. Each mortal furry life extinguished is an /i/nsurgent soul raised to glory. Thus, our eternal destiny is written in the blood of the furfag.

With box and tampon destroy the furfag. With pizza and Koran smash the furfag. With credit card hacks and searing Mormons scatter the furfag to the stars. With gore and dataforce and bandwidth rape, with hax and AIDS and Jehovahs, with yellow vans and steroids!

Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all!

As my Master told it me I now tell it thee that thou shalt tell others in thy turn.

In an internet of a million sites, what is the death of one site in the cause of purity? Some may question your right to destroy ten billion furfags. Those who understand realize that you have no right to let them live.|Anonymous, on fursecution philosophy.}}

===Furry Hater's Creed===

<i>I hereby solemnly swear that I will do all I can to uphold the values of humanity, not insanity, as the cornerstone of any society.

To do this, I swear that I will not hesitate to destroy the Furries wherever they may stand or whomever they may be, nor will I back down from my duties.

I realize that their perversion is a black mark on humanity which cannot be wiped clean. It must be cut out entirely and destroyed as a cancer.

Just as the depravity of the Furry knows no bounds, nor shall my thirst for their permanent extermination.

I pledge that I will do all I can to obliterate the Furry fandom, and I swear that all the sick fucks who align themselves with said fandom will go with it into the fiery pits of hell.

And when I am finished, when my glorious task is done, when the last Furry on Earth has been obliterated into nothing more than a smear of sicko porn and fucked-up plush toy, I will rise and say “Look here. The deed is done.” And I will be exalted in glory eternally.</i>
