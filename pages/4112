{{lj|user=ionotter}} is one of the [[furry]] fandom's many [[drama whore]]s.  His [[fursona|murrsona]] name (which may or may not be his real one) is Alexsandyr Troutnoodler.  Already, you know that this guy not only guzzles otter [[cum|semen]], but probably [[fuck]]s trout as well.  

Ionotter is also one of the founding members of the [[Kadaitcha Dancers|Kadaitcha stalkers]].

{{lj|user=ionotter}} flipped the fuck out when he found out that he wasn't allowed to bring otter semen on the plane anymore -- all the post-9/11 Jewery finally hit home.  He also made sure to post this to the communities for every convention he'd planned on attending, telling them [[Fuck_you%2C_I%27m_a_dragon%21|"Fuck you guys, I'm not comin'!"]]. Thankfully [http://hazzzardcore.ath.cx/q/mfm%20Concerning%20convention%20attendance%20and%20flying%20in%20the%20Terrified%20States%20of%20America__.htm they were saved for posterity by] another [[furry]] [[fuck]]-face, {{lj|user=railfoxen}}.  {{lj|user=ionotter}} claims that [[The Man|the government]] is trying to infringe on furry rights by banning animal semen from aircraft.  However, he later claimed to work for [http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/105552.html?thread=2728528#t2728528 the American Government] before [[Delete fucking everything|deleting everything]].

Aren't you glad that [[furry]] [[fat|fatties]] are defending [[shit nobody cares about|freedom]]?  He also later writes [http://community.livejournal.com/mfm/51839.html several crybaby posts] about being [[troll]]ed.

He also takes his man-tits very seriously.[[Image:Ionotter-fatass.jpg|right|thumb|Ionotter at his natural size, doing the only thing he is talented at.]]

==YOU BETRAY YOU PAY==
Everything is [[serious business]] to Ionotter, especially LiveJournal and the internet.  God forbid you suggest that [http://corelog.livejournal.com/484223.html] the trusted bond of the almighty sacred friendslist might not be so secure] (hint: it's not).

<div style="width:60%;overflow:auto;font-style:italic;border:1px dotted black;margin:auto;padding:4px;">Oops, missed it. Oh well, I guess that means you have a spare "apology credit" with me, since I read this anyway..  '''You betray, you pay.'''</div>

This clearly shows that over-consumption of otter semen has had an adverse impact on his psyche.

==The dangers of LJ==
<div style="width:60%;overflow:auto;font-style:italic;border:1px dotted black;margin:auto;padding:4px;">My f-lock is there for a fucking reason. I got FIRED because my boss read my journal and reported my EncyclopediaDramatica page to the commanding officer, because he thought *I* had written it.<br/><br/>It resulted in me getting kicked off the ship in Djibouti, Africa.</div>

The above edit only added to his incipient paranoia:

<div style="width:60%;overflow:auto;font-style:italic;border:1px dotted black;margin:auto;padding:4px;">I'm having trouble remembering if I that quote was in someone else's journal, or my own. I wouldn't be happy if it came from here, instead of a comment in someone else's journal. I mean, if it came from someone else's journal, then there's really not that much I can do about it. Some folks here are "friends" with some really [http://ionotter.livejournal.com/516956.html soul-destroying/soul-destroyed people], and I can't control what those folks do in the journals of my friends.

I'll do a cursory search to see if that quote came from my journal or not and take care of it from there. After all, if there's a leak, it should be '''[[butt plug|plugged]]'''.</div>
