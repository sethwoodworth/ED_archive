'''Dancing Owen''' is a non-meme from  the arse of [[Jewgrounds]]. A character initially known for being a character on a crappy children's show called ''[[Total Drama Island]]'' is now largely forgotten amongst a more immature audience due to a few brief threads on the unread forums.

==Orgin==

This 'meme' was perpetrated by at least 100 fucking [[idiots]] who couldn't get it together enough to even write coherently on [[encyclopedia dramatica]] about it. Their logic was, 'if we quickly post a few threads on the [[shit|NG BBS]] and then shit out a crappy ED page, we'll be [[pointless|the makers of an actual, verified meme]]!' In short, this was all a plan to give meaning to some people who had not yet felt the touch of a woman or the taste of a beer and achieved nothing more than potentially embarrassing the creators in a few years' time.

A year earlier before the inevitable meme was brought to life, Canadian TV which is 70% American programming (with an extra 30% reserved for [[communist|"Can-con"]] revealed the third episode of [[Total Drama Island|Total '''FAIL''' Island]] which is famous for scarring the lives of many Canadians with a scene showing Owen doing a victory dance with no clothes on '''UNCENSORED''' and resulted in Teletoons (lol even Canadian cartoon channels NAMES are gay) getting more faggots to watch it's shitty and poorly done flash animations by airing a censored version to make sure lawsuits do not occur.

As it was an image from an unknown and unloved TV series, nothing happened until a year later when [[lesbian|TOEZ]] posted the photo. A [[basement dweller]] saved it to his computer to [[fap]] to later and started to mass spam the picture on to other topics.

As the attempted meme quickly whithered in Newgrounds, and as very few fans of TDI have even heard of it, nobody pondered the perpetrators, or indeed gave a shit.

===ED and TDW===
The meme is known in the form of an article in Total Drama Wiki and has had its own version of templates on ED.

===YTMND===
Just [[Last Thursday|last Thursday]], the image surfaced again to the dark bowels of [[YTMND]], ironically only Photoshop molested with the words "Dancing Owen" and "Reloaded", hinting that the meme was trying to be forced onto another unwilling internet cesspool. The most tenacious spamming was done in the [[Stickam]] NG chatrooms, resulting in much [[rage]].

===Stickam===

After getting butthurt repeatedly, the fans of this beaten meme think that raiding the Newgrounds Stickam rooms with this shit will turn their luck around by sparking a series of raids known as [[fail|Operation Owen]]. Even though it lasted only twenty-two minutes, it did spark some lulz for everyone else, when the administrator banned the losers.

As a result, this is the first time ever that a forced meme remotely sparked some lulz in any website's history.

==How Dancing Owen almost became the owned.==
While it has been proven that a meme can thrive in Newgrounds unlike [[YTMND|some other cesspools]], this meme, unlike its other BBS counterpart, [[Dickneck]], [[boring|isn't interesting]] to the rest of the NG populace. As a result, the creators are lamely trying to insert this image wherever they can, pointlessly attempting to wedge yet another [[unfunny]] image into an already overcrowded internet.
