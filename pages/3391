Godwin's Law
{{quote2|As a thread grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.|Mike Godwin}}
'''Godwin's Law''' is the [[old]]est meme [[OTI|on the internet]]. It was made up in college by a [[college]] student named [[Mike Godwin]]. According to those who witnessed the event, around 1990, Godwin was actually sleeping in one of his [[shit|law sk00l]] classes when he abruptly woke up from a [[orgasm|nightmare]] about one of two former deviant sexual partners of his that we'll simply refer to as either [[goatse|"Lisa B-S"]] or [[cunt|"Wiggly Toes"]]. His incoherent screaming sounded much like the phrase uttered that has become known as "Godwin's Law":

'''"As a [[Usenet|Jewsnet discussion]] (Later translated to mean any thread [[on the internet]]) grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or [[Hitler]] approaches one."'''

According to those who know Godwin or either of the significant whatevers, both of these ladies were Hitler incarnate, which means the nightmare probably had one or both of them gassing the poor bastard in the Camps. Or making [[sick fuck|hot]] monkee [[rape|luv]] to his fat ass. Same difference.

What followed for Mike Godwin, we can only imagine, was an unremarkable career in [[buttsecks|stag films]]. Thereafter, he went on to become the General Counsel for [[TOW]]. [[SRSLY|Seriously]].

[[Cool story bro|It ought to be noted that the word Hitler could be replaced with anything and the rule would still be true.]]

==Usage== 
[[Image:Godwinned.gif|thumb|Now a verb!!]]
There is a tradition in many groups that, once this occurs, that thread is over, and whoever mentioned the Nazis has automatically lost whatever argument was in progress. Godwin's Law thus practically guarantees the existence of an upper bound on thread length. [[Osama Bin Laden]] has been lobbying for his own variant on the law and has proposed the name "'''Godwin's Fatwa'''" for such occurrences. This has been denied on many occasions on the grounds that Bin Laden is, in fact, a Arab.

Despite the increasing likelihood of such comparisons, the probability of such a post never actually reaches a certainty. Thus, [[some argue]] that a thread can indeed continue into eternity, or until it is cut short by either the indefensible actions of trolls, or [[g2g i need sleep]].

Godwin's Law manifests itself on [[LiveJournal]] so often that it spawned a [[fake journal]], aptly named {{lj|user=godwin}}.

==Important Safety Tip On Usage==
[[Image:Scientonazicult.jpg|thumb|Chanology is subject to this law]]
It is no longer necessary to be a Gentile to be a Nazi.  For example, [[User:Simone|Simone]] is a Jew, but she is still a [[Grammar Nazi]].  There is also substantial evidence that the [[Brb_soup|Soup]] [[Kramer|Nazi]] was a Jew.

== The Godwin Variation ==
[[Image:Hitler_and_Baby_jk.jpg|thumb|Hitler, left, attempting to seduce an infant.]]
Boy, that sounds like a Robert Ludlum book. The Godwin Variation is a natural mutation of Godwin's Law that was almost inevitable as the Law became more and more prolific and respected. In its popularity, it has become a method to voluntarily end one's involvement in a [[flame war]] that has outgrown its hilarity. When one or both sides of a war are reduced to [[Ad_hominem|ad hominems]] (IE, "ur a [[fag]]," "your [[cock|dick]] is small," "[[16 year old girls|girls]] hate you," "you [[fuck]] [[goatse|goats]]"), it is in the best interest of the war that one's personal involvement be killed outright. To do this, one can respond to one or all comments on the thread with the [[Fifty Hitler Post]], which is simply an outrageous number of images of Adolf Hitler in close succession. This is almost guaranteed to get you banned from the thread, thus ending your involvement. Like [[Las Vegas|Vegas]], quit a [[flame war]] when you're ahead.

== Quirk's Exception ==

Intentional invocation of this so-called "Nazi Clause" is ineffectual. He will, however, deliver presents on 4/20 of any given year.

== Occupancy Effect ==
It has [[Some_argue|also been said]] that when a discussion moves towards [[Furry|who/what]] occupies [[Hell|Hell]] that the chance of mentioning Hitler is [[OVER 9000|increased dramatically]].
