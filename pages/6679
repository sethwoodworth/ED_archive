Publicgirluk
'''Publicgirluk''' was a [[drama]]-generating [[troll]] on the [[Bureaucratic Fucks]] [[RPG]] and [[Facebook|social network]]ing site, [[Wikipedia]]. Public girl gained quite a fan base by posting numerous photographs, probably all of herself (although the court of the [[Bureaucratic Fucks]] was out on that one until they blocked her altogether). Said photographs were intended to illustrate the mysteries of the 'pearl necklace', as in the one that doesn't come from oysters (depending on the variety of English, it may come from bush or prairie oysters). The rabid interest this generated is illustrated on [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Publicgirluk&oldid=71710482#Appreciation the old talk page] reproduced below.

===A (relatively) serious request===
:Hi, an image that you modeled for and uploaded was used in the article [[Wikipedia:Pearl necklace (sexuality)|Pearl necklace (sexuality)]].  There is a consensus among the editors that while the picture itself has many fine attributes (as do you) it really isn't an accurate depiction of a Pearl Necklace. Is it possible that you would be willing (strictly for the sake of encyclopedic interest) to provide a more accurate image?  While I'm actually serious about this request, I'd also like to add that if you're interested in having someone review your future adventures in modeling , you're most welcome to contact me via email. Thanks for your contributions to [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia|WP]], and have a great day :) --[[Wikipedia:User:Doc Tropics|Doc Tropics]] <sup>[[Wikipedia:User talk:Doc Tropics|Message in a bottle]]</sup> 17:11, 27 July 2006 (UTC)


Thanks Doc. None of my pictures are modelled specifically for wikipedia they are just suitable pictures of me from my own personal collection. I thought the picture was representative but happy that others don't. If the bf takes a better one I'll upload it. --[[Wikipedia:User:Publicgirluk|Publicgirluk]] 07:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

"It is unfortunate that there was any debate at all here. This was pretty clearly a case of trolling. I would recommend a checkuser on various parties involved to see who else we ought to block in this nonsense. People are really missing the point if they think we should allow this kind of nonsense to go on. This is an encyclopedia, not a free speech zone for trolls.--[[Wikipedia:User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 16:05, 30 August 2006 (UTC)"

: It seems a stunning violation of AGF to assume publicgirluk was trolling without any evidence of it.  My respect for Jimbo just dropped a couple of notches, though I expect others will feel the opposite.  =)  [[Wikipedia:User:LtPowers|Powers]] <sup><small><small>[[Wikipedia:User talk:LtPowers|T]]</small></small></sup> 21:07, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
::Edited to add: isn't his second comment (indef block publicgirl and speedy the images immediately) pretty much an admission that we can ''never'' have free-use images illustrating certain things?  I mean, if not these then what?  [[Wikipedia:User:LtPowers|Powers]] <sup><small><small>[[Wikipedia:User talk:LtPowers|T]]</small></small></sup> 21:09, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
:::No I don't think so. [[Wikipedia:User:Theresa knott|Theresa Knott]] | [[Wikipedia:User talk:Theresa knott|Taste the Korn]] 23:26, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
::::Then what kind of images would be acceptable?  If the image publicgirluk uploaded isn't suitable to illustrate [[Wikipedia:Facial (sexuality)|Facial (sexuality)]], what image would be?  Or are we restricted to illustrations rather than photographs on certain topics?  [[Wikipedia:User:LtPowers|Powers]] <sup><small><small>[[Wikipedia:User talk:LtPowers|T]]</small></small></sup> 00:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
:::::I don't think we are necessarily restricted at all. But these are sensitive matters and should be discussed on the individual article talk pages and a consensus reached. And it should be done on a case by case basis. Illustrations are certainly appropriate for certain topics for sure. Blanket statements mean nothing. [[Wikipedia:User:Theresa knott|Theresa Knott]] | [[Wikipedia:User talk:Theresa knott|Taste the Korn]] 01:10, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
::::::You issue a call for adherence to process, Theresa, but practically every process was short-circuited or ignored in this case.  The images were speedied without even a hint of consensus beforehand, little explanation afterwards; the user was blocked because Jimbo, in what I think may have been an offhand remark, commented that she "looked" like a troll (oh yes - and that those of us attempting to assume good faith were "suckers" for doing so).  These are not examples of WP procedures being faithfully followed.  The community lost its head on this one and is ''still'' losing it.  So yes, I agree with you, consensus ''would'' be nice.  But currently, it would appear no consensus ''is'' required when a pretty woman uploads sexually explicit self-pics.  It's far more meaningful to examine what a system or group ''does'' than what it says it will do.  Already we have lost at least two editors over this, and those are just the ones we know of.  So we can't just say "work the process and it'll go away"; we need to get that new policy page in shape and then use it.  [[Wikipedia:User:Kasreyn|Kasreyn]] 11:31, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
:::::::P.S.  Note that these issues, by and large, were not decided by the editors on the talk pages of the associated articles (such as [[Wikipedia:Facial|Facial]] and [[Wikipedia:Pearl necklace (sexuality)|Pearl Necklace]].  They were decided by editors largely having nothing to do with those pages.  So clearly something is not right, eh?  [[Wikipedia:User:Kasreyn|Kasreyn]] 11:31, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
::::::::The thing is, I simply don't share your views on Publicgirluk's motives here. I don't see her as a poor innocent who was treated badly by the nastly wikipedians. My own views are pretty close to those of Jimbo's although I personally wouldn't have blocked her, Two editors lost? So what? People are always foot stamping and storming off. I've seen it dozens of times before and i simply don't care. Anyway back to the point in hand - I'm not saying "work the process and it'll go away" I'm saying we cannot use this incident to state that " we can ''never'' have free-use images illustrating certain things". Is it necessary for us to illustrate perl necklace? I don't think so, I don't even think we need the article - surely it's a dictionary definition? But that's just my personal opinion. The community may think different, but it's pretty clear that someone uploading a picture of a girl covered in spunk should expect to at the very least be willing to assure people that the girl is willing to have the photo appear hear. The fact that Publicgirluk feigned indignation speaks volumes to me. Please do come to the policy debate page. Actually doing something constructive, rather than the endless talk (which is happening on this page) feels good.[[Wikipedia:User:Theresa knott|Theresa Knott]] | [[Wikipedia:User talk:Theresa knott|Taste the Korn]] 13:25, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
:::::::::Spot-on. -- [[Wikipedia:User:RyanFreisling|User:RyanFreisling]] [[Wikipedia:User_talk:RyanFreisling|@]] 14:34, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
:::::::::Odd.  I thought [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Publicgirluk photo debate|Wikipedia:Publicgirluk photo debate]] ''was'' the "policy debate page".  I'm not sure why you think Publicgirluk "feigned indignation" but it seems like begging the question.  And if I recall correctly, the person uploading the picture ''did'' "assure people that the girl is willing" -- it's just that a lot of folks didn't believe that person.  And if Jimbo's suggestion had been followed (namely that she's an obvious troll, indef block, and speedy all the photos ASAP), she never would have had a chance to do that.

::I couldn't agree more, LtPowers.  Jimbo's word carries astonishing force at WP.  I'm sure he has his reasons for thinking Publicgirl_uk was a troll, but he needs to explain ''what those are''.  If they're good reasons, I'll be satisfied.  I'm ''not'' satisfied by an encyclopedia where his mere ''opinion'' of an editor gets them blocked.  I've left a comment on Jimbo's talk page to this effect.  [[Wikipedia:User:Kasreyn|Kasreyn]] 11:22, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

Jimbo needs to justify his comments. --[[Wikipedia:User:Golbez|Golbez]] 23:35, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

Jimbo is about as wrong on this issue as the sun is hot. My respect for him (as well as a number of other persons involved) did indeed drop, and not just by a "couple of notches". &mdash;[[Wikipedia:User:Nightstallion|<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Nightst</span>]]<font color="green">[[Wikipedia:User:Nightstallion/esperanza|<span style="font-variant:small-caps">a</span>]]</font>[[Wikipedia:User:Nightstallion|<span style="font-variant:small-caps">llion</span>]] [[Wikipedia:User talk:Nightstallion|''(?)'']] 11:32, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
: Two things still bother me about this.  First, that Jimbo failed to provide any reasoning for why publicgirluk was so obviously trolling, and at which point future contributors who try to submit similar material should be considered similarly trolling -- immediately after upload, or only after refusing to take a special "Yes it's me" picture?  The second thing is that Jimbo was not obviously speaking [[Wikipedia:ex cathedra|ex cathedra]] -- if his intent was that publicgirluk be blocked immediately he could certainly have done so himself.  It seems to me he was expressing an opinion, and a few admins who happened to agree took it as justification for an immediate block without community consensus.  [[Wikipedia:User:LtPowers|Powers]] <sup><small><small>[[User talk:LtPowers|T]]</small></small></sup> 19:28, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
::Well, the admin who restored the block after it was reverted claimed that Jimbo had informed him more fully in an email conversation.  I don't know what precisely Jimbo said in that email; no one, to my knowledge, has yet requested that information.  It occurs to me that when Jimbo's remarks are made in his capacity as (essentially) chief administrator of Wikipedia, such remarks should definitely be on-the-record rather than private.  (Of course, his private conversations, when not engaging in his official role, are his own business.)  [[Wikipedia:User:Kasreyn|Kasreyn]] 01:33, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
