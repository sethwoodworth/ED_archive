City glitter
{{lj|user=city_glitter}} was just like any other [[16-year-old girl]]: lived with her parents in the [[suburbs]], loved [[communism|sociopolitical reform]], and had two cats.

Then one day [[100 years ago|about a year ago]] she decided to set her cat on fire in order to extract [[money|sympathy]] from her [[e-pals]].

Like anything that has to do with the suffering of furry little animals, it spiraled out of control when [[at least 100]] hippies sent her cashola via PayPal in order to pay for the $5,000 vet bill.

Don't understand? Here's a helpful diagram.

==Troll's remorse?==
Of course like any [[drama whore]] whose cat was [[almost raped]], it all ended up being a complex web of [[lies]], spun for the sake of social [[drug|experimentation]]. (Note: "[http://city-glitter.livejournal.com/847289.html The experiment was a success.]")

Unfortunately, her friends didn't agree that being [[rape]]d in the name of [[science]] was OK, and proceeded to [[flame]] her after she made a [[ass|but]]-filled apology.  She promptly [[quitting IRC forever|quit LiveJournal forever]].

Basically, she claims she wanted to prove there were good people still left in the world. So she then went on to completely rape them out of some hard-earned cash. She killed off hundreds of good people doing this, and is now regarded by thousands to be a total [[bitch]].

When one of her [[furry]] friends ({{lj|user=foxfur}}) called her on her bullshit, she attacked her via AIM. <strike>That conversation can be found here: [http://onlyslightlyevil.net/ama/aimlog2.html] No it can't it was deleted forever.</strike> Nevar Forget!![http://web.archive.org/web/20061213211639/http://onlyslightlyevil.net/ama/aimlog2.html]
