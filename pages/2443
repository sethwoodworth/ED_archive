'''[http://eq2players.station.sony.com/Nagafen/Dramasetter/ Dramasetter]''', [[powerword]] '''Joseph Kres(s)''', is an [[EQ2]] player on the Nagafen (geez, who would have guessed) that got arrested for robbing a Check 'N Go in Las Cruces, [[New Mexico]]. It occured in mid-January, [[2010]], and the actual event was being broadcasted throughout Freeport as he got arrested. A few weeks later, [[Dankshasta]], when not fucking Azns, decided to find the Google cache entry of the news article. [http://www.eq2flames.com/nagafen/58159-good-bye-dramasetter.html And so he did,] and posted it on [[EQ2Flames]].

According to some [[Guido|guy]] called Dreww, he texted a player called Raax ''the night he got arrested, and asked him to sell his account for bail money''. According to Dankshasta, in-game he used a fucking paintgun.

==Raacs and the "Truth"==
[[File:Raacs_truth.PNG|thumb|right|Raacs says, "Dramasetter will be out [[sic|if]] jail this year. He's not in prison. So please stop it with the rumors."]]

On February 6, 2010, Raacs, who held Dramasetter's game account at the time, [http://www.eq2flames.com/nagafen/58432-dramasetter-actual-truth.html posted a thread about the event] - he said that he'd be out of jail this year. Guess he was right. Praise be to [[Hitler|Overlord Lucan D'Lere]] for being so kind to him.

==Release==
On April 9, 2010, Dramasetter came back to Flames with the following:
(Apparently not aware that 'gangsta niggas' don't play fucking ''EverQuest II''... unless they're on Nagafen.)
