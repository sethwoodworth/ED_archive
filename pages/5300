'''Memorial page tourism''' is a popular [[fun|recreational activity]] on the internet most popular and accessible on [[Facebook]]. When a newly deceased and [[No one likes you|much loved]] dear friend/relative/celebrity/stranger’s memorial page arrives on the newsfeed most [[fags|Facebook users]] can’t help but to click and [[perv|gawp]] as one might at the sight of a [[Brian Peppers|train wreck]] or [[your mum|mangled car]]. These beacons of [[baw]] inevitably draw the [[Infantilism|cry babies]], [[sluts|moral fags]], [[Westboro Baptist Church|trolls]] and [[Virgins|white knights]] of teh internetz together... I SMELL A SITCOM!

[[some argue|Everyone knows]]{{citation needed}} [[shit nobody cares about|what’s-their-name]] was a [[emo|beacon of hope in an otherwise unbearable existence]], an [[failure|A grade]] student who [[fucked|respected]] their teachers and was [[lie|loved by everyone]]. Thankfully some [[attention whore]] has set up a page in memorandum which will let [[you]], [[unwarranted self-importance|YES YOU]], [[live journal|tell everyone]] how you felt about this [[No one likes you|friend of a friend of a friend]] that was in a similar sounding network as you. For whoring purposes they leave these groups open to all-commers so we can [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE|share they love]], which only serves to generously [[Don't feed the trolls|feed the trolls]] which -in turn- leads to even more [[butthurt]] which leads to [[old media]] attention, accusations of [[cyber bullying]], [[Kim Jong Il|expert]] analysis, threats of [[lolsuits]] and, eventually, an [[ED]] [[internet fame|page]] and perhaps even another [[an hero]]. It's the [[lulz|circle of life]]!


{{quote|Lovely Group. Memorial page tourism is way up and continues to grow. So much love, remembrance, vial hatred and most of all comical nonsense of considering a facbook page SACRED ~ !Ha !|Aki Mutsumi|[[Alexis Pilkington]]'s memorial page}}

==Tenderhearted Tourists==
These tenderhearted trauma tourists keep a pen and paper ready at all times to note down names they might see on flowers by the road side, [[Maddie|news reports]] and freshly dug graves, so they can be found later on Facebook. They never knew the dead but they know in their hearts of hearts they would have been BFF's [[fan fiction|with them if they actually ever met them]] [[in real life]], (an impossibility as memorial tourism is a harsh [[basement dweller|mistress]]).

==White Knights==
[[File:Memorial_tourism2.png|thumb|right|500px|Facebook Memorial Page [[White Knight]].]]
Like in days of [[web 1.0|old]], White Knights defend the honour of their [[Oprah|Queens]] against the attack of pipe lurking creatures such as [[trolls]]. These fag enablers were born [[unfunny|without funny bones]] and [[lurk]] in memorial pages waiting to unleash a [[fail|jihad]] on all who dare speak [[truth|ill]] of the dead. White Knights don't care how minor the criticism is because [[objection|YOU ARE WRONG!]] [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|crashing into a tree in a stolen car with a heroin needle sticking out your arm]] is [[Serious buisness|SRS BSNS]] and in no way the [[rofl|'victims']] fault. White Knights are self righteous anti-trolls but often use the same tactics so god forbid you mizspell or bad grammar use.
