'''Benadryl''' is an over-the-counter [[drug]] containing the [[WTF|anticholinergic antihistamine]] '''Diphenhydramine''' (DPH) available at your local Walgreens (other meds with DPH include Simply Sleep, Unisom and various allergy medications). Taking between 15 and 25 pills can result in dreaming while awake and some fairly legit ball-trippage (seeing spiders and shadowpeople everywhere and talking to friends that aren't really there). But if you don't take enough you'll probably just like... want to go to sleep, man. For about 18 hours. Either before or after throwing up a powerful jet of neon green vomit. People who take DPH are usually [[16-year-old girl]]s and/or boring losers who listen to too much [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] and read shit like Hegel. 

'''''[[PROTIP]]:'''''  If you drop something while high on Benadryl, don't worry about searching the floor for it, you were never holding anything to begin with

'''''[[PROTIP]]:''''' Taking Benadryl with acetaminophen (THAT'S [[Wikipedia:Tylenol#Tylenol PM|TYLENOL PM]], RETARD) will [[divide by zero|divide your liver by zero]].  Don't listen to [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|us]] though; [[lie|we're stupid as fuck and don't know the first thing about drugs]].<BR>

'''''[[anal|LIMPTIP]]:'''''
Or you could just get the off brand shit at [[Wal-Mart]] thats just pure DPH. Taking over 700 mg's (AKA joining the [[Jerry Falwell|700 Club]]) will put you in a constant never ending state of [[anal|WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?]] as in melting walls, buzzing trees, garbage cans doing slow motion flips, and all the usual schizophrenic shit. And smoke lots of [[weed]] with it, otherwise you won't feel high and you'll think the trips are real and you'll run outside [[buttsecks|naked]] with a knife and have the [[pig|cops]] called on you.<BR>

====Dramamine====

'''Dramamine''' ('''Dimenhydrinate''') is roughly the same thing as DPH. After [[Fat Larry's Band|Modest Mouse]] released the song titled "Dramamine", [[13-year-old boys]] started to try and get high off of it. People post on trip forums online saying that it made them see shadow people, [[television]]s turned on when they were off and their dead mother bitching about being up too late. If you don't have a [[psychotic]] breakdown, however, [[vomit]]ing will be the highlight of your trip; as for afterward, you will feel so sick and tired you will probably pass out. Sadly, the body turns 50 grams of Dramamine into only 25 grams of DPH, making it twice as hard to get high. Also note that roughly three quarters (or [[over 9000|moar]]) reports on dramamine trips end up with the author in hospital and a BIG fucken hospital bill that you'll be paying off for most of your shitty life.

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Taking 4 bottles (48 pills) is the best way to trip, at least until just before your brain does a runner, and you fucking hope to god your loved ones find you before you die from kidney failure or heart attack, then you'll be rushed to hospital and straight into the emergency room, where nurses named [[Cockmongler|Steve]] will [[rape|force a catheter]] up your [[cock|pisshole]] and force you to drink [[shit|charcoal fluid]], then hours/days later, when you finally come down from your psychotic trip you will spend several days in a mental hospital for your attempted suicide and months of [[Psychiatrists|psychiatric therapy]] and [[rehab]], then your pissed off parents will drag you home, beat you savagely and sell you to a turkish brothel to pay for the 80,000 dollar hospital bill you've just caused them because you didn't bother to fucking research this drug on [[erowid]].  Have fun tripping!
