Sec Check
[[Image:Scilonsssf.jpg|thumb]]

'''A "Sec Check"''' (security check) is a kind of [[torture|interrogation]] that the [[retards|big shots]] of a [[Scientology]] "org" will give to a person when there is a chance they may have been exposed to something that conflicts with [[batshit insane|official Scientology doctrine]]. This happens a lot, as the existence of everything else in the universe proves that Scientology is complete nonsense. For example, if a Scientologist reads a web site critical of the cult, and then reports this to the org (which they are required to do, and which they always do), the leaders will insist upon giving a sec check. The interrogations are grueling and silly. There are sec checks for all occasions, and there are [[Child Abuse|especially harsh sec checks for children]]. Sometimes the interrogators will gang up on the victim, an event known as a "[[rape|gang-bang sec check]]."

Here is an example of something called a "Whole Track Sec Check." As always, the [[victim]] is hooked up to the [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Secrets/E-Meter/index.html "e-meter"] (a <s>primitive</s> fake lie detector) and interrogated for hours with the following insane questions.
