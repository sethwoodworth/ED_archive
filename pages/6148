===All News: All The Time===

News of Anonymous' activity spread quickly, first through chat rooms and forums, then blogs and online news sources before [[slowpoke|finally being reported]] in old media.  The initial response was largely positive and the PROJECT was even dubbed an act 
of [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/21/riaa_hacktivism/ "hacktivism"], a portmanteau of hacking and political activism. Many people were glad to see that someone was finally taking on this dangerous organization even if they disagreed with the [[rape|methods being used]].

{{quote|I understand your concerns about Scientology. However, I do not favor revoking Scientology's tax-exemption because I oppose raising federal taxes on any individual or group, even when I disagree with elements of that group's political agenda. The precedent of tax-exempt revocation may some day be used to justify raising taxes on other tax-exempt groups, including religious organizations.|Congressman [[Ron Paul]]}}

If you would like to help spread our word to your own media so that they can cover us too, here's a handy little form you can email to them.

Dearest Media,
The following is a warning to the Cult of Scientology.  It is being sent to you in order to warn the masses.

On February 10th, 2008, the second stage in the war against Scientology will begin.  All across the world, we will strike as one.  We will continue our protest for as long as it takes to bring them down.  We, Anonymous, are taking a stand for humanity. We are taking a stand for freedom of speech. 

We are Anonymous.
Anonymous is legion.
We do not forgive.
We do not forget.
We ALWAYS deliver.

And we're coming for you.

Signed,
Anonymous.

===[http://ottsun.canoe.ca/News/OttawaAndRegion/2008/02/11/4839922.html OTTAWA SUN]===
By TERRI SAUNDERS, Sun Media

A small group of Ottawa young people took part in a global protest against Scientology Sunday by ambushing staff at the church’s Rideau St. centre.

About a dozen youths stood across the street from the centre as one of their members made his way up to the second floor of the street-front office.

Covering his face was a picture of Rick Astley, a British singer best known for a string of pop hits in the 1980s. In his hand was a portable stereo.

[[Rickroll|“Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,” the young man sang as he danced in front of a church staff member in a meeting room. “Never gonna tell a lie and desert you.”]]

The majority of the protesters wore some form of mask or covering over their faces in order to protect their identities. That was one of the suggestions put forth by Anonymous, an Internet-based group which has recently publicly declared war on the Church of Scientology.
