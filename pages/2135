'''Death List''' is a website where [[sick fuck]]s discuss who is going to [[die]] during any given year. It is the most famous [[deadpool]] on the [[internets]]. These people often receive [[BAWWWWW|complaints]] from those who are [[butthurt]] about the fact that Death List users start [[fapping]] every time someone [[celebrity|famous]] dies on [[Wikipedia]]'s [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_deaths recent deaths] page, and consider it disrespectful to the memory of the deceased.

The site itself mainly deals with people who are [[notable]] enough for a Wikipedia article, and only considers the person valid if they were likely to get a [[UK]] obituary. In accordance with that the [[Uncyclopedia|humour on the website is particularly British]] and thus superior to Americunt humour, although compared to the [[lulz]] of the [[Wrong Location Nigger|multicultural]] internets society of the 21st Century, it can't compare. [[Wikipedia Admin Gallery|Wikipedia admin]], [[Canadian]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Canadian_Paul Paul], is a member of Death List. It should also be noted that his username can be made into the acronym [[CP]].

==History and Deaths==
[[Image:Allingham calment.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fapping]] material for Death List members.]]
[[Image:Gerontobear.jpg|thumb|right|What Death List members are really like at their core.]]
Death List was started in [[at least 100 years ago|1987]] [[shit nobody cares about|as a result of actor Cary Grant's death]]. Some bored [[university|students]] decided to draw up a list of which [[notable]] people they thought would die in that year (and [[fail]]ed [[epic]]ally at it, [[lol]]), the only successful hit being [[guitar|Andr√©s Segovia]]. The list also included [[shit nobody cares about|Dad's Army]] actor [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Dunn Clive Dunn]. Because Dunn, like three other names on that list, is still alive today, Death List members worship him and [[batshit crazy|now believe he is immortal]], and he is also titled as a "[[Creepy|Death List Favorite]]".

Since 1994, the Death List had been restricted to 50 names. Most of these names are people that everyone with a [[no life|life]] has [[shit nobody cares about|long since forgotten about]], the majority of the names being [[old]] or [[cancer]] sufferers. Some of the popular past Death List names include [[Christian|Mother Teresa]], [[The Royal Family|the Queen Mother]], Bob Hope, [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Pope|Pope John Paul II]], while popular names today include secondary mascot [[Prison|Ronnie Biggs]] and [[Gay|Dunn]].

Most of the people who are on the list itself are [[male]], and most of them are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_white_males white], although [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=protect&user=&page=Dead+black+males&year=&month=-1 black] men feature more than women, due to [[Barack Obama|bros]] b4 [[Hillary Clinton|hoes]]. Amazingly, a black woman named [[Muhammad|Ruby Muhammad]] was included on the 2007 list. She claimed to be [[old|born in 1897]], and has the title of "[[Your Mom|Mother]] of the Nation of [[Islam]]." Despite being so old, she still survived the year, and the Death List members complained about Muhammad's inclusion.

People on Death List are [[batshit crazy|unusually fascinated]] by [[old|supercentenarians]], leading some to believe that they may have a [[fetish]] for them. [[Irony|Ironically]], many famous people die in any given year who are not on the death list, therefore making their endeavors [[epic]] [[fail]]. There is also a [[forum]] where people suggest who's likely to die soon, and at present there have been [[over 9000|many]] mentions of [[Amy Winehouse]].

==Relationship between Death List and [[Wikipedia]]==

[[Image:Bartversieck.jpg|thumb|left|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bart_Versieck Bart Versieck]. [[Sarcasm|Extremely sexy indeed]].]]

Despite the lack of a Death List [[article]] on Wikipedia, DL and [[TOW]] are on good terms. For starters, DL supports links to TOW by having links to it on its main page for finding [[shit nobody cares about|more information]] for the Death List candidates, but everyone does that nowadays because every stupid fuck turns to TOW for information these days.

However, there is a more interesting relationship, particularly surrounding the people only [[notable]] for being very [[old]], known as supercentenarians. There is a [[WikiProject]] on Wikipedia about teh [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_World's_Oldest_People World's Oldest People], and although its members are not Death List users, there has been a [[war]] between trusted admin Canadian Paul and the likes of Bart Versieck, a confused man from [[Belgium]] who appears to be interested in little other than women who are 110+ years old, and styles himself as "extremely [[sexy]]". Bart's friend, the [[loser|longevity researcher]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ryoung122 Robert Young], was indef-blocked from Wikipedia for fucking with the [[Wikipedia admins]] and their Nazi regime. Bart Versieck had been on the verge of a permanent [[ban]] for repeatedly editing others' [[talk page]] messages even after many, many warnings. However, Versieck has not edited recently.

==Lol, someone is actually [[offended|OFFENDED]] by Death List!==

[[Image:Vera Lynn CDAJA5464.jpg|thumb|right|[[34]]'d]]

[[Last Thursday]], someone, presumably a [[woman]] due to the name [[Uncyclopedia|Sophia]], got [[butthurt]] over Death List, [http://www.deathlist.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=682&st=120 can you believe it]?

{{quote|this is a [[lemonparty|sick site]] for [[sick fuck|sick people]], hopefully others will feel the same about [[basement dweller|you lot]] when [[Grammar Nazi|your]] [[Heath Ledger|dead and gone]], the people you all [[fap|heckle over]] on this site are people who have made a huge [[shit nobody cares about|historical imapact on our lives]] wether you like them or not, there would be a very boring existence without the entertainment, and helping to make this world a more [[Somalia|tolerable place to be]], with exception of course of those names who tried in the past to make it less tolerable like [[South Ossetia|warmongers]] etc.
Vera lynn was there to give some [[buttsecks|hope and support]] to those who fought for [[Israel|this country]] , you could BARELY imagine how it must have been for those soldiers, those that fell and those families who perished would wonder what [[nothing|they sacrificed thier lives for]] if could have read comments on a [[Electric Retard|pathetic site]] like this from those who [[BLP|cowardly write such demeaning rubbish]]. I stumbled across this to find a site to pay tribute to someone, god knows how I came across this place, the site that crawled out of the [[goatse|gutter]] and am only leaving this comment as obviously as a minority here I stand up for those who cannot speak out because they are not with us and those who would not find this site worthy of a comment or [[internet tough guy|need to justify themselves]]. [[BAWWWWW|shame on you all]], no doubt expect the usual cowardly comments to follow this, but those who do are naturally [[not gay|uncomfortable with themselves]], so you should be.|Sophia}}
