Snugglenets/Nay Quits Irc Forever Again
<pre>
[4:23] @(neigh) i wish there was some way to like
[4:23] @(neigh) transmit actual ideas
[4:24] @(neigh) and feelings
[4:24] @(neigh) through tcp/ip
[4:24] @(neigh) or through english even
[4:24] @(neigh) through anything
[4:25] @(neigh) irc isn't even an issue
[4:26] @(neigh) life conditions as they are (for whomever) are just infinitely unmanagable and when people attempt to render it more managable they just end up in a modular polly pocket hell
[4:27] @(neigh) it's so hope demolishing
[4:28] @(neigh) i refuse to have my life and my humanity and my soul compromised and all i get is misery and negative ebay seller ratings
[4:29] @(neigh) maybe i am a ghost
[4:30] @(neigh) there has to be something to do on earth that involves other people
[4:30] @(neigh) there
[4:30] @(neigh) has to be other people
[4:30] @(neigh) right?
[4:32] @(neigh) i guess the odds aren't in my favour on this one and i should know when to leave well enough alone
[4:33] @(neigh) i have too much faith
[4:34] @(neigh) i invest a lot of faith in people
[4:34] @(neigh) the reason i am in a hypothetical band right now is because i have faith in someone
[4:35] @(neigh) there a just a few people on whom it isn't wasted
[4:35] @(neigh) she is one
[4:35] @(neigh) at least according to my judgment atm
[4:36] @(neigh) so long as i am not remaining willfully ignorant of anything glaring
[4:36] @(neigh) some people will never make it, of course..
[4:36] @(neigh) they'll just continue to be frozen in time, falling in place
[4:40] @(neigh) stressful not being able to do and say what i want
[4:41] @(neigh) i can't wait forever for good things
[4:41] @(neigh) who can wait forever for life to prove itself more than an idle pastime
[4:44] @(neigh) all we do is judge each other idly in some vain attempt to preserve our own status. hearts neutralised and perverted
[4:45] @(neigh) and you know you're never sure, but you're sure you could be right, if you held yrself up to the light, etc
[4:45] @(neigh) question on my mind always is WHAT CAN BE DONE
[4:45] @(neigh) what can be done for them
[4:47] @(neigh) stupid rhetorical questions
[4:47] @(neigh) i wish i could answer that shit and actually do something for once
[4:48] @(neigh) but there is only fear and paranoia and bla bla bla
[4:51] @(neigh) what can be done to stop all of the insipidity and soullessness of life
[4:52] @(neigh) why can be said to a person who sucks ass and is gay
[4:52] @(neigh) what*
[4:53] @(neigh) ANOTHER THING
[4:53] @(neigh) whatever happened to honesty
[4:53] @(neigh) no one tells me shit
[4:55] @(neigh) fears binding every sort of social contact ever
[4:56] @(neigh) easily averted problems, easily changed directions.. struck down by ridiculous and vague jungle fear
[4:56] @(neigh) FUCK IT
[4:56] @(neigh) what can be done for these people
[4:56] @(neigh) i spent so much time
[4:56] @(neigh) catering
[4:56] @(neigh) and caring for that matter
[4:58] @(neigh) my heart and my hands and my mind all belong to me. 100%. and no one around will get anything good out of any of these, my most valuable things, unless they do, 100%
[4:59] @(neigh) belong to me
[5:00] @(neigh) while i'm willing to let my moral imperatives continue to bend, it is time to temper them to greater extent, in the interest of fostering growth + gains in integrity
[5:01] @(neigh) i remember saying the same before lent this year
[5:01] @(neigh) when i was not on the internet for that period
[5:01] @(neigh) my stupid friend dom came back from florida
[5:02] @(neigh) and i managed to naive myself back into stupidtown pretending we could start a groop and be nerds
[5:02] @(neigh) such neurosis
[5:02] @(neigh) such naivety
[5:02] @(neigh) i amaze myself
[5:05] @(neigh) at some point it just becomes so neccessary to cut yr losses
[5:05] @(neigh) i spose
[5:06] @(neigh) i haven't won them all
[5:06] @(neigh) i won some
[5:06] @(neigh) those were ok
[5:07] @(neigh) i've made some people's lives a little brighter in my day
[5:07] @(neigh) some others a little darker
[5:07] @(neigh) god knows i wanted to help them
[5:08] @(neigh) and that i would try my hardest to do so
[5:08] @(neigh) even when there was no promised safe zone at the end
[5:10] @(neigh) i suppose i should return to how it was pre-lent
[5:11] @(neigh) when i wasn't a lovesick goof
[5:12] @(neigh) when i followed the sun totally
[5:13] @(neigh) this whole year was a derailment of that movement
[5:13] @(neigh) i only have fond memories of last winter
[5:13] @(neigh) idk why, it was cold and sucked
[5:14] @(neigh) but i had scarves and socks and enya and dark chocolate and cold medicine
[5:14] @(neigh) and i was surviving
[5:15] @(neigh) i guess there was something corrupt in my anticipation of spring
[5:15] @(neigh) because i shattered when it came
[5:17] @(neigh) i suppose the difficulty of these years shouldn't be underestimated
[5:17] @(neigh) but we always never see it comin
[5:18] @(neigh) i suppose you'd have to know a lot of people to be so literate in failure from the get-go
[5:18] @(neigh) otherwise you'd better be prepared to own up to your own en masse
[5:18] @(neigh) irc is distracting and not snuggly
[5:18] @(neigh) anyways
[5:19] @(neigh) this channel is cursed
[5:20] @(neigh) and you will all suffer a great deal for having joined to it.
[5:21] @(neigh) i didn't notice myself until the other day.
[5:21] @(neigh) so that's why i didn't tell anyone.
[5:21] @(neigh) totally cursed though.
[5:22] @(neigh) anyways
[5:22] @(neigh) yes
[5:22] @(neigh) i will still be around
[5:23] @(neigh) on other venues of correspondence
[5:23] @(neigh) such as aol
[5:24] @(neigh) ta ta 4 now
