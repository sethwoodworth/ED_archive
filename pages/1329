Many Vietnam vets find their solace in heroin and whores.  '''Captain Crunch''' (aka '''John Draper'''), on the other hand, took his tortured mind and abused [[Bell]].  Contrary to what he claims, he actually never had any skill besides lvl 2 soldering. [[blue box|Blue boxers]] had become the [[script kiddie|script kiddies]] of [[phreak|phreaking]] by the time Crunch was doing anything.  He had a friend who realized that the 2600hz sound in a breakfast cereal toy was not the devil speaking to him, it was actually a time travel machine that could make free telephone calls.  [[Woz]] recruited Crunch into his super elite [[bantown|hack team]] and they travelled around the US doing acid and confing.  Soon, he turned media whore and spilled the beans to the Village Voice.  [[The Man]] didn't like the fact that Captain Crunch was bragging so loudly about his [[skillz]], so they put him in [[prison]].

== Working with Woz ==
After working at [[Apple]] for a bit, he programmed one of the first word processors ever for the Apple ][ and the [[IBM]] [[PC]] -- therefore, he should be rich, but he's not because his code was all ripped from [[Bill Gates]].  He blew all his money on acid parties and virgin boy rape factories.

== What he is doing now ==
Captain Crunch is now a dirty old man who convinces 18yo raver boys to let him touch them for "energy work" meditation.  His pupils are pinholes and he's missing <s>most</s> '''ABSOLUTELY ALL''' of his teeth, likely due to [[meth]]. His incredible laundry list of [[Woz|famous people]] on his resume failed to get him any actual work. Once people realized he was completely clueless he had to start his own failure of a business... which then failed. He is now working as the CTO for a small start-up, a job which consists of harassing small children, harassing large children, acting like a child, and smelling very bad.

== Failures ==
His first and only project was [http://freshmeat.net/projects/crunchbox/ CrunchBox] which was supposed to be an [[OpenBSD]] firewall+intrusion detection system. The project proved to be a huge [[failure]] and never went past anything more than talk. However if you talk to Draper he will claim that he sets up custom CrunchBox's for networks at 20 k a pop. Draper has pretty much slipped into obscurity, don't ever start a convo with him or you may never escape, especially if you are a teenage boy. But for those that are brave he can be IMed at jdcrunchman on aim. His other only project was an attempt at making a TV show ([http://www.crunchtv.net/ CrunchTV]) targeted at [[Newbie|noobs]] with the goal of [[Bullshit|"Handling 95% of all the security threats in the Internet Frontier"]]. Future guests may include [[Kevin Mitnick]], [[13-year-old boy|his energy-workout partners]], or [[Homosexuality|his friends]].
