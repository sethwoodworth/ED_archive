Spyro is the name of a budget game series and the budget [[Furry|scaly]] who stars in them.  Created in [[Old|199-something]] for no reason other than to rake in some extra cash from the furry mascot boom of the 90s, by [[Stupid|Insomniac Games]] for [[Playstation|Sony.]]  Of course the games were a commercially successful, yet hideous failure because no one wants to play as a tiny purple lizard.  By the fourth game in the series, nobody really cared anymore and all went of to start playing [[Valve|Half Life]] and other mature games instead of [[Gook|super happy fun time games.]]  This included Insomniac, who fucked off to make the equally [[Retarded|successful]] [[Furry|Ratchet and Clank]] and [[Mass Effect|Resistance]] franchises.

==The Games:  Original Series==

'''Spyro the Dragon'''

The [[Virgin|first]] game in the series, it was widely accepted by [[Retards|hardcore gamers]] and [[Retards|casual gamers]] alike for its low resolution technicolor worlds, the ability to [[Zippocat|torch small animals]] and satisfy your kleptomaniac [[Fetish|urges]] to collect shiny multicolored rocks.  The story involved a little aspie [[Otherkin|Dragon]] named Spyro rescuing the dragon elders who have been tied up by [[Bondage|bondage]] fanatic Gnasty Gnorc.

'''Spyro 2: Ripto's [[Rage|Rage]]'''

Known as "Gateway to Glimmer" to [[Europe|Eurofags]], this game [[Fail|succeeded]] in becoming one of the most furry titles to hit the [[Playstation|PS1]] since [[Crash Bandicoot|Crash Bandicoot]].  [[At Least 100|At least one hundred]] of the the game's levels contain armies of little furry characters and even lolis, who ask you to perform [[Blowjob|tasks]] in exchange for [[Crack|gems.]]  Notable additions to the gameplay formula are the ability to come into contact with water and not evaporate into a puddle of [[Hawt|Dragon cum]], and the character of Ripto, an [[Midget|oompa loompa]] with a [[France|Napoleon]] complex and a dick growing out of his forehead for [[Wut|reasons we can't fathom.]]

'''Spyro 3: [[China|Year of the Dragon]]'''

Spyro is back and on the trail of a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] who kidnapped all the baby dragons from the nursery and hid them in [[Asshole|special hiding places]] because [[Derp|it's definitely safer than hiding them in the giant fucking castle she lives in.]] It's up to Spyro to amass a furry army and take the baby Dragons hymens before the Sorceress can, bonus points if you can bribe them to keep quite with candy.

'''Spyro: [[Weaboo|Enter the Dragonfly]]'''

The first game to not be developed by Insomniac games, it is rarely mentioned among fans because it suffers from a serious case of [[Truth|"I don't give a fuck"]] on the developers part.  The game is just a [[Halo|graphically scaled up re-release of the previous games]] with all the faggy characters imported from the [[Old|last gen]] roster.  Also buggy as shit, code fucked up all the time and it crashed more than [[You|your fat ass when you reach more than two miles an hour walking speed]], with twenty minute loading screens. Awesome!

'''Spyro:  [[Do Not Want|An Hero's Tale]]'''

A beta for the soon to be released Legend of Spyro Trilogy, it abandoned the platforming and [[Idiot|puzzle]] solving focus of the older games and shifted it's attention to the furries that plague Spyro's world.  The goal of the game is to use a black light to track cumstains that the furries leave behind, and eventually finding their furry dens and beating the piss out of them until they die.  Scores for each kill are tallied by a combination of [[For Great Justice|how loud they scream when you wrench their balls off, how much bodily fluid you can drain before they die and the amount of furry tears you collect from their bedsheets afterward.]]  Some [[Fag|experts]] who actually played the game believe that the it's about stopping an evil dragon from draining the planet's [[Cum|energy]] with demonic gems, but who really [[Nobody|fucking cares anymore?]] srsly gaiz.

==The Games: [[The Legend of Zelda|Legend of Spyro Trilogy]]==

[[Image:Frodo_Spyro_Shoop.jpg|thumb|left|The Legend of Spyro games pretty much summed up with one [[Shoop|shoop]]]]

'''The Legend of Spyro:  [[No|A New Beginning]]'''

Deciding that the little purple fag had served his purpose and the Spyro [[Britney Spears|cash cow had been milked to the point of it's crispy nipples falling off,]] the Ausfags at Krome Studios decided to give the ODing series a shot in the heart and [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|rebooted the entire fucking series.]] The game now focuses on Spyro, the [[Mary Sue|last purple Dragon in existence OMG,]] who was aborted as a baby and dumped in a trashcan where the native dragonflies raised him as one of their own.  He grew up as an awkward child, shunned by all the ladyflies for being purple, scaly and having a dick too small for even them to make use of.  But one day some shit fucked up and an evil Dragon bitch named Cynder started destroying the world, Spyro being the [[Fag|hero]] that he is, ran away from the niggerflies village to saev teh daey!

'''The Legend of Spyro:  [[Goth|The Eternal Night]]'''

The [[Electric Boogaloo|Electric Boogaloo]] of the Legend Trilogy, basically the same as the last except Cynder is now a whiny [[16-year-old Girl|teenage]] bitch and Sparx is voiced by Fry from [[Futurama|Futurama]].  The plot involves something about ape [[Buttsex|booty pirates]] kidnapping him and some other shit and Spyro developing an evil alter ego,  but we don't care anymore than we did several games ago do we?

'''The Legend of Spyro:  [[Lord of the Rings|Dawn of the Dragqueens]]'''

The Spyro publishers finally got off their flabby assholes and decided to [[Smart|take the series rights away from Krome]] and give it to some french people who knew their shit.  The games [[Ugly|graphics]] have been significantly updated and new features such as [[Orgy|co-op]] and the ability to rape Cynder if she runs off her mouth.  The <s>[[Good|final game in the series]]</s>LOL another one coming out, it features an epic story entirely [[Lie|original and completely unrelated to Lord of the Rings.]] Basically, the world of <s>Middle Earth</s>Avalar is being threatened by the evil Lord <s>Sauron</s>Malefor who plans to use <s>the One Ring to Rule them All</s>Destroyer to [[Banned|b&]] the entire universe.  After helping in the battle at <s>[[Nerd|Minas Tirith]]</s>Warfang, <s>Frodo</s>Spyro and <s>Sam</s>Cynder meet up with <s>Legolas</s>[[Furry|Cunter]] and travel to <s>Mordor</s>Burning Lands where Ignitus shows up and An Heroes [[For Great Justice|so they don't get hot feet when walking across the warm ground.]]  Along the way, Spyro almost succumbs to <s>The Power of the One Ring</s>Dark Spyro but Cynder gives him a handjob and he returns to normal.  They eventually have a gigantic battle with <s>Sauron</s>Malefor and end up destroying themselves to defeat the [[Harry Potter|Dark Lord.]]  After the credits roll, you find out that Spyro and Cynder are actually still alive and just entered the witness protection program to hide from their stalker Ignitus, who also survived spontaneous combustion.

==Other Games==

[[Image:Crash_Spyro_Experimenting.jpg|thumb|right|The special [[Rape|link]] feature between Spyro: Orange and Crash: Purple]]

'''Spyro:  Season of Ice'''
TL;DR 2D version of the PS1 games.

'''Spyro:  Season of Flame'''
[[Copypasta|See "Season of Ice"]]

'''Spyro:  Attack of the Rhynocs'''
[[Copypasta|See "Season of Flame"]]

'''Spyro Orange:  The Cortex Conspiracy'''
Worst game in the handheld series. No story to speak of, and basically one area to explore. [[No|BUT ITS AWESOME CUZ IT HAS CRASH CHARACTERS IN IT.]]

'''Spyro:  [[Emo|Shadow Legacy]]'''
[[Copypasta|Same as the first two except on DS]]

'''Spyro's Kingdom'''
The working title of a recently announced game for the DS, Wii and whatever else [[Asshole|Activision]] thinks people will buy it on.  Judging by the current title, it seems that it might kick off an entirely new Spyro series.  For anyone who hasn't been paying attention so far, that's bad...really bad.

==Characters: [[Lie|Original]] Games==

[[Image:Oldspyro.jpg|thumb|right|Don't fuck with me, [[Internet Tough Guy|I'M PURPLE MUTHA FUCKA!]]]]

'''Spyro the Dragon:''' A little purple dragon who thinks he's pretty hardcore, but really everybody just plays along with him so they don't hurt the retarded kid's feelings.

'''Sparx:''' One of the dragonflies that [[Rape|bond]] to their own dragon at birth (OH! I geddit, dey boff hav "Draggun" in der naames xDDDD;;),<s> he follows Spyro around and does fuck all</s> DISREGARD THAT, GRANDFATHER CLOCKS!  He absorbs damage whenever Spyro gets hit and [[Satan|cannabilizes amanals for power.]]

[[Image:Elora_Youd_Hit_It.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yes|You would totally hit it you sick bastard]]]]

'''Elora:'''  Introduced in Spyro 2, she is a magical faun, translated from [[Otherkin|Otherkin]] language it means "Whiny fucking goat bitch".  She doesn't do much aside from telling Spyro what to do and telling him to do it faster.  There is an easter egg in Spyro 2 that lets you punch her square in the ovaries and tell her to "Shut your mouth and make a goddamned [[Sandwich|sammich.]]

'''<s>Hunter</s>[[Cunt|Cunter:]]''' A <s>crazed furry</s>they're all crazy, who believes in UFOs and government conspiracies.  Hooked up with Bianca in Year of the Dragon and had a bunch of cross species babies.

'''Bianca:''' A rabbit bitch who worked for the Sorceress until Hunter raped her into submission, she turned heads more than any other original Spyro character when revealed all that was under her cloak was some string and dominatrix boots. She died shortly after Enter the Dragonfly by overdosing on sleeping pills.

'''[[Aboriginal|Sheila]]''' A <s>British</s>there are no [[Australia|kangaroos]] in Britain retard, who pounds Spyro on the side because the other bitch is a goat and Bianca's taken.

'''Sgt. Byrd:''' [[Wut|A psychotic veteran penguin from Vietnam,]] he is the only character to win in the entire series, because he ditches magical firebreath and ground stomping attacks, instead [[ALL CAPS|BLOWING THE FUCK OUT OF ENEMIES WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER BITCH!!!]]  Is actually the Soldier from [[Team Fortress 2|TF2]] in disguise.

'''Bentley:''' A big fuckin' Yeti who uses his [[Retard|retard strength]] to bash enemies faces in with a club and knock shit out in the boxing ring.

'''Agent 9:''' An escaped monkey cosmonaut with a voice so annoying that even Tom Kenny's screeching vocals would be an improvement.

'''Moneybags:''' The Jew who shows up every now and then to extort some cash from you in exchange for doing something that Spyro could do himself if he didn't have clawed muffs for hands.  He doesn't show up in the Legend Trilogy because he knows that if he tried pulling his [[WTC|Jew stuff]] around new Spyro he would probably get a kick in the balls and a broken arm. In the end of each game you can hold him at gunpoint until he hands over all of your hard earned Jew gold that he stole.

'''Gnasty Gnorc:''' The villain from the first game, if you could really call him that.  He spent most of the game telling everyone not to make fun of him because he is seriously business, and even proceeded to magically [[Banned|b&]] the Dragons when they called him names and hurt his aspie feelings.  Came back in A Hero's Tale but... [[Shit Nobody Cares About|well you know.]]

'''Ripto:''' Angry orange midget who wants to compensate for having a [[You|small cock,]] so he takes over the universe.  This happens several times during the original games, each without any proper explanation as to how or why seeing as he can't do anything right.

'''The Sorceress:''' A bitch from Year of the Dragon who wants to [[Abortion|eat the stem cells from baby dragons]] and fuck the corpses so she can live another thousand years

'''[[No|Red:]]''' A crappy Mary Sue of a villain from An Hero's Tale [[Truth|who's even more poorly designed than a Scooby Doo Villain.]]

'''Ember:''' A [[Sonic the Hedgehog|stalker fangirl]] who follows Spyro around and feels him up while he sleeps. Is eerily similar to Amy Rose.

==Characters: Legend of Spyro Trilogy==

'''Spyro:''' Now voiced by [[Bitch|Elijah Wood]], the same guy who was Frodo in [[Lord of the Rings|LOTR.]]  He is now even moar of a pussy than be used to be, always whining about Malefor and Cynder and all the [[Serious Business|cereal shit]] going on around him.  Also made up a second [[Stupid|"Dark Spyro"]] personality so he can tell the Cynder that he [[Because of my Syndrome|wasn't in control]] whenever he decides to [[Rape|fuck her in her sleep.]]  According to everyone in the gaem world, Spyro is apparently [[Raptor Jesus|TEH CHOESEN WUN HOO WIL FREE US FROM TEH EVUL DARK LORD <s>VOLDYMORT</s>MALEPHORE!!1]]

'''Cynder:''' The Mary Sue who switches between being [[Emo|angsty]] and telling Spyro to go away/asking for a pity fuck because she was the [[Satan|antichrist]] for a little while there.  She doesn't do much in the first two games other than make your day shit for the [[Lulz|lulz]], but then Spyro rams a crucifix up her ass and expels the evils, OH LORDY!  She takes a more active roll in the third game, waving her [[Pussy|dark magicks]] at the enemy and giving Spyro a blowjob in the public toilet when he needs to let off some chosen one [[Cum|steam.]]

'''Sparx:''' Now reduced to the obnoxious comic relief who is neither comical nor relieving, he is voiced by a different person in each game.  [[Fag|David Spade]] (Fucking annoying dwarf from Just Shoot Me and Benchwarmers) in the first game, Billy West (Fry and pretty much every other character in [[Futurama|Futurama]]) in the second game.  In Dawn of the Dragon they don't even bother giving him a known voice artist, just some random nigger coz everyone's too busy pausing the game and fapping to Cynder's life story.

'''Ignitus:''' The elder [[Pedophilia|dragon]] voiced by Gary Oldman. (Seriously Black in [[Harry Potter|Hairy Pooter]] and [[Russian|Resnov in COD: Black Ops]])  He doesn't do much apart from bitch to Spyro about the seriousness of the situation, until he commits [[An Hero|an hero]] to halp Spyro and Cynder defeat Malefor.  LOL not really, he is actually alive and has become the new [[Weed|chronicler]] despite clearly bursting into flames earlier on.

'''Cunter 2.0:''' To fit in with the Lord of the Rings theme, Hunter decided to be Legolas in Dawn of the Dragon, except moar furry and [[Serious Business|serious]].  Unlike Legolas however, he doesn't seem to have [[STFU|shutting the fuck up]] or using that longbow he carries around for anything other than pleasuring himself on those cold lonely nights.

'''Malefor:''' An evil Dragon voiced by [[Star Wars|Luke Skywalker]], every talks about how evil he is but he doesn't actually show his face until <s>Order of the Pheonix</s>Dawn of the Dragon.  He then reveals to Spyro during the final battle that <s>I am your father</s>OMGIZZLE HE WUZ A FUCKIN PERPIL DRAGUUN WHO TERNS EVUL AND ITS SPYROHS DESTINEE TO JOIN HIM AND RULE <s>THA GALACKSEE</s>AVALAR.

==The Movie:  The Legend of Spyro [[Avatar|3D]]==

[[Image:Spyro_3D_Poster.jpg|thumb|right|The image that caused a thousand [[Waaaambulance|Bawwws!]]]]

Some time [[Last Thursday|last Thursday,]] the current [[Fags|developers]] of the Spyro franchise revealed that a 3D feature film based off the Legend of Spyro games was to be released in the following months.  This announcement accompanied by a teaser image of the titular purple faggot standing on top of a cliff with his [[Cock|chest]] thrust proudly into the air, made a million fangirls squirt simultaneously and flood most of [[Poor|Indonesia.]]  Of course <s>rational fans</s>everyone else knew that the devs were trolling and many [[Truth|better]] games out there were closer to hitting the big screen, but the fangirls continued to piss themselves in anticipation while refreshing the Spyro site's update page for news.  Months past and the only peep to come out of the devs were that the film was delayed another half a year, but otherwise no information from the apparent voice artists or the company supposedly animating the movie.  Finally the day came when the film was to premiere across [[USA|the states]], and nothing happened.  Spirits began to die down as the hours ebbed away and eventually disappeared altogether.  The next day, Spyro's dev team once again addressed the tubes and revealed that the movie had been cancelled out of lack of interest months ago and never actually started production, the company who had supposedly been animating the film was revealed to simply be making [[Lol| a direct-to-DVD Scooby Doo movie and nevar agreed to produce Spyro 3D in the first place.]] Fans across the world committed mass suicide and the surviving ones retreated to [[Deviantart|Deviantart]] where they could hide their feelings from the world once more, everybody concerned agrees that absolutely nothing of value was lost that day.

'''UPDATE:''' Movie confirmed to be in production by 20th Century Fox, helmed by Michael Bay and Gore Verbinski, teaser trailer set to premiere at showings of the upcoming Halo Movie.

==The <s>[[Retards|Fanbase]]</s>Spyrotards==

While indeed a prime target for scaly fandom, the original [[Shit|trilogy]] went largely unnoticed due in part to [[You|nobody being aware of it's existence]].  That is until the release of the Legend of Spyro trilogy, which introduced a myriad of new furry characters and old furry characters alike.  Combined with the ability to create many [[Lie|original]] characters by simply recoloring pre-existing characters and adding a [[Emo|painfully angsty backstory]], this has proved to be one of the biggest [[Deviantart|artistic tumors]] to grace the tubes colon since [[Sonic the Hedgehog|Sonic the Hedgehog]].

==Creating a New Spyro Character==

'''Step 1:'''  Take an image of Cynder from Google images.  Don't worry about using any other characters, Cynder is the only one you will fall in love with and take [[Rape|care]] of/use as a Mary Sue for your own devious ends.

'''Step 2:'''  Now open the downloaded image in [[Shoop|MS Paint]] and use the paint brush tool to color the character a tone of your liking, and then go outline the edges with black.  Don't waste time making it perfect, the next step will clear up any [[Retard|imperfections]].

'''Step 3:'''  Copy and paste the current image into GIMP or any other trial photoshop software you wish to use and use the blur tool to smooth the outlines and make the image seem hand drawn, using the dodge and burn tools are also recommended to shade the image and give it that professionally [[Hentai|inked]] look.

'''Step 3.2:'''  If you're feeling [[Autistic|creative]], break out the pencil tool and add some [[Ghey|cool]] looking symbols and tattoos to your character.  (Feel free to skip this step, you wouldn't be the first)

'''Step 4:'''  Give your character a name to suit his/her personality.  [[Bad|Good]] choices include Blaze, Ember, Flamior, Flamion, Burnus, Darkash, Poopy Mc. Shitfaced... the choice is yours!  An appropriate backstory is also key to making a [[Bullshit|believable and relatable]] character, popular examples are [[Leet|"Eye am teh last livingh Draggun in a speshul line of super Droggons"]] or [[Ronery|"I is possessed bi a evel demuns that makes me sad and insecure unles yo embraece me luvingly."]]

'''Step 5:'''  Now that your character is finished, post it on Deviantart so all the other Spyrotards and scalies can comment on how [[Bullshit|original]] and [[Wut|sexy]] your character is.

'''Step 6:''' ????

'''Step 7:''' Profit!
