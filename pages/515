'''Amelie Walker''' is an [[Australian]] "journalist" employed as youth affairs reporter for [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s Herald Scum newspaper in [[Melbourne]]. She created [[lulz]] after writing a "news" article based entirely on [[fake|plagiarising user posts]] from the [[raver]] forum [http://www.inthemix.com.au inthemix.com.au] (ITM).  Having spent some time lurking the forum, probably to score [[drugs|E's and Whizz]], she then betrayed her forum drug-buddies by dropping their dox's in a national newspaper article after datamining them on [[MySpace]], even dropping the name of one of the forum users '''Ralph Wiggum!! LOL!!'''.  After this, like any decent [[internet]] [[terrorist|citizen]] they datamined her dox and made amusing [[shoops]] of her ... only to be threatened by the newspaper's [[lolsuit|legal team]].

Perhaps Amelie Walker went into the newspaper game with all the best intentions of a [http://www.education.netpresence.biz/pagedetail.asp?intpageid=1041&stsection=students&intsectionid=2 22 year old journalism graduate], wanting to carve a name for herself whilst sticking at least to the basics of ethical and moral reporting. She probably [[idiot|doesn't even realize]] she's contravening her own industry's codes of practice and journalistic ethics in general - you DON'T interview people under false pretenses!  Though she probably [[retarded|never understood]] what "journalistic ethics" were to begin with. 

* '''CONCLUSION : She is part of the [[cancer]] that is killing journalism, <br>and is contributing to the downfall of the [[old media|printed media]] as a source of news.<br><br>'''

Although dedicated to the [[rave]] scene, ITM owes its commercial success to its [[fail|community guidelines]] [[nazi|not allowing]] any discussion or promotion of [[fbi|illegal]] [[drugs]]. Thus its userbase get immensely [[butthurt]] at the mere suggestion any of them has used drugs ever, when in reality they all take drugs together every weekend.

ITM forums had already been quoted in the news in recent times, starting with a [http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=318494 November 7, 2007 ninemsn news article] misquoting a [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=210287 thread on ITM] where ITMers joked about buying and eating recalled child's toy [[Aqua Dots|Bindeez]].

The next mention came with the [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22819148-5007132,00.html November 26 article] in the Daily Telegraph (also owned by Rupert Murdoch) trying to implicate ITM in organizing an [[rave|illegal dance party]] in [[Sydney]]. Problem was, the [[anonymous]] "journalist" got the site name wrong, instead writing [http://www.intermix.com.au/ intermix.com.au] which is the website for a [[fail|food products company]].

==Amelie's article==

[[Image:Ralph_wiggum.jpg|thumb|120px|Obviously a credible source]]

On Saturday December 8, the annual [[rave|Ultraworld festival]] was held overnight at [[jail|Kryal Castle]] in Ballarat, near [[Melbourne]], and while a few people were arrested for possession and others carried away in ambulances after overdosing, for the other 5000 people it passed without incident (ie. they can handle their drugs).

Then on December 11, [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,2293261-2862,00.html Amelie's article slamming the rampant drug use at the rave was published] in the Herald Sun, entirely based on quotes from the inthemix.com.au forums. While most ITM users use a pseudonym username on the forums, many include a link to their [[MySpace]] in their profile, which Amelie had apparently used to find out their [[powerword|real name]] and [[docs|suburb of residence]] to attribute their comments in the article. 

<big>'''Amusingly one comment was attributed to the forumuser's username <br>as if Ralph Wiggum were a real name - Credible Source!!.'''</big> 

Many forum users were [[butthurt]] at having their already publicly available information made public, and this was made even worse given the article was published on the Tuesday after the rave when they were on their comedowns.

The ITM users responded with a threads like [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=12872 "Post stuff here you want quoted in the herald sun!"] and [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=22897 "So who's up for a rave at Herald Sun HQ?"] before [http://www.inthemix.com.au/forum/showthread.php?t=212877 they started datamining her!]  Looking up ''her'' [[docs|publicly available information]] on [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] producing [[lulz]].  Before long her photo had been photoshopped at raves taking drugs and then photoshopped doing any old unfunny shit. ITM moderators initially allowed this until Amelie caught wind of it and BAWWWWWWWWWW'd to them and they realised the pictures were also against the community guidelines and had to go.
