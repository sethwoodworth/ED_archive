* ajt sets mode: +v Hoveround
<Pokchu> What are his problems?
<ajt> like what kinds of propblkems?
<ZeroUser> parental problems, mental abuse, and the such
<ajt> my father crippled me
<ajt> I am bound to a wheelchair
<ZeroUser> his parents are doing htat to him mentaly
<Pokchu> he has a weak mind then
<ZeroUser> no
<Hoveround> ZeroUser what does that have to do with him blanking pages on ED
* ninjagumby has joined #arbchat
<Hoveround> or you blanking pages
<ZeroUser> i have the same problem
<Hoveround> for that matter
<Hoveround> that is not how wikis work
<ZeroUser> thats my doing 
<Pokchu> Zero: help us better understand this abuse
<ZeroUser> also the furry page is just platantly mean
<ZeroUser> blatently*
<Pokchu> um
<Pokchu> it's accurate
<Hoveround> blatantly  fyi
<ZeroUser> not really
<Pokchu> no, really
<Hoveround> ZeroUser please show examples of inaccuracy
<ZeroUser> lol i dont have the best spelling, sorry
<Pokchu> why do you think it's innaccurate
<ZeroUser> because i was in the fandom for years and i noticed some of whats there but alot of it isnt as serious as its depicted
<Pokchu> why did you choose to become a furry Zero
<Hoveround> ZeroUser please show examples with more specificity
<Pokchu> was it because you couldn't make any friends in real life?
<Hoveround> Pokchu lets try and stay on track
<ZeroUser> i have RL friends
<Pokchu> yeah ok
<Hoveround> specific examples of inaccuracies on [[darkfox]]
<ZeroUser> hmm im not really a furry persay but i do partake in the fandom to a point
<Hoveround> or [[furry]]
* BURK is now known as dosentbelievezerouser
<Pokchu> I'm sorry, continue
* dosentbelievezerouser was kicked by DLB (stop it BURK�)
<Hoveround> ZeroUser - how would you define a furry
* BURK has joined #arbchat
* loljews is now known as zerouserisdarkfox
* Autistic is now known as OneUser
* zerouserisdarkfox was kicked by DLB (stop�)
* DLB sets mode: +i
* cam is now known as HisParentsAreDoingThatToHimMen
<ZeroUser> there are differnt levels of beig a fur actualy
* HisParentsAreDoingThatToHimMen was kicked by DLB (DLB�)
<Hoveround> ZeroUser so on some level, you are a furry
<ZeroUser> i like the anthro animals, that bout it
<Hoveround> "partaking of the fandom", in our definition, = furry
<ZeroUser> in SL all i do is wear the AVs and that bout it
<Hoveround> ZeroUser - I want you to  answer this truthfully as we have IP logs and your current hostname
<Hoveround> and this is important
<Hoveround> are you DarkFox
<Pokchu> So if you're not as much of a furry as you claim you are, why are you so upset over our furry article
<ZeroUser> thnen you have the people that are so involved they go to the extent of body modification
<Hoveround> ZeroUser, are you DarkFox, please confirm this
<ZeroUser> because i know alot of furs and i have respect for the fandom completely
<ZeroUser> um, no im not
<Hoveround> site sysops, can you do an ip match to the page blanking of [[darkfox]] 
<Hoveround> and match it to ZeroUser's current hostmask?
<Hoveround> thanks
<Hoveround> ZeroUser please state how you would like to resolve this matter
<Hoveround> be clear
<ZeroUser> the blanking is done through a random proxy
<Pokchu> Hover: what would that accomplish? we know this is the same guy that blanked [[Darkfox]]
<ZeroUser> that was me i use proxies alot when im surfing, lots of bad scripts out there
<ZeroUser> just remove the page
<DLB> that is not an acceptable resolution
<Pokchu> Zero: Why should we?
<DLB> this is a give and take situation
<Pokchu> Convince us to.
<ZeroUser> ok then make them provide a more accurate depiction of him
<ZeroUser> i hate things that are 1-sided
<DLB> Zero: well, could you give us information that would allow us to make a more accurate depiction of him?
<ZeroUser> there is a reason he acts like that, if they want to post provide that in it just dont a completely hatefull flame
<DLB> or perhaps he would like to be interviewed for his article
<Hoveround> can you be detailed about his reasons for his character?
<DLB> have you talked to him about this whole situation?
<ZeroUser> i doubt it, you can ask him though
<DLB> like: did you do this yourself? or did he ask you to do this
<ZeroUser> i did this ut of respect for my friend because i know what hes going through and this isnt helping
<Hoveround> are you talkng to him now?
<Hoveround> like, on IM ?
<ZeroUser> i dont have his im, i contact him through my freinds list on SL
<Hoveround> �i move to issue a summons for Darkfox to join #arbchat
<Hoveround> will someone second the motion
<Pokchu> I second that motion
* BURK is now known as MOTION
<DLB> i second'd
* ninjagumby is now known as second
<Hoveround> motion carried
* second is now known as ninjagumby
* MOTION is now known as BURK
<Pokchu> BURK, you could just ask for voice
<Pokchu> if you have something to say
<DLB> BURK: and dont fag things up if you do
* DLB sets mode: +v BURK
<Hoveround> ZeroUser - We herewith issue for a summons for Darkfox to join #arbchat
<Hoveround> to speak on his own behalf
<BURK> ok yes darkfox must be here
<ZeroUser> ill tell him next time i see him
<BURK> as we can not trust the words of a vandal
<DLB> would you mind seeing if he is OL on SL?
* DLB sets mode: -v BURK
<ZeroUser> he just pops on SL from time to time, hes taking a break and playing WoW
<Hoveround> �i move we adjourn until darkfox is able to join and verify his identity
<ZeroUser> wich is the worst idea ever IMO but im not gona stop him
<Hoveround> anyone to second?
* ChanServ sets mode: -o DLB
* ChanServ sets mode: +v BURK
<BURK> hoveround i would second but i think we need to question zerouser on his affinity with the accused
* ChanServ sets mode: +v cirrus
<Hoveround> motion withdrawn
<ZeroUser> ask away
<Hoveround> i agree burk
<BURK> zerouser why did you do this
<ZeroUser> aint got nothing to hide
<BURK> dont say out of respect or anything like that
* Pokchu sets mode: +o DLB
<ZeroUser> why, because darkie is close to me, i know whats hes dealing with 
<cirrus> ZeroUser: you will blank an article for your friends wellbeing, but will not stop him playing WoW. I question your motives
<ZeroUser> well its more like i cant stop him
<Pokchu> What did you think you were acccomplishing by page blanking anyway?
<Hoveround> ZeroUser are you located in the UK
<ZeroUser> and trying to will just upset him further
<Pokchu> A page blank can be reverted in five seconds
<BURK> zerouser how exactly does this interfere with darkfox
* ChanServ sets mode: -o DLB
<BURK> its not like this is on the front page of ed
<BURK> so no one but those who google him constantly know of it
<ZeroUser> true but some how he sawit and this upset him greatly
<Pokchu> ZeroUser, please convince us that Darkfox is deeply disturbed and mentally abused by his parents, and he's not just an emo kid vying for attention
* ChanServ sets mode: +o DLB
<BURK> zerouser if he saw it why didnt he take any action himself?
<cirrus> pictoral/textual proof requested
<BURK> yes and no photoshoping 
<Hoveround> ZeroUser the issue here is that this is all hearsay
<BURK> as i have seen many pixels
<Hoveround> we dont even conclusively know that he has an issue with page
<ZeroUser> i can try but i try not to pry to much into ppls lives, what i know is from what hes told me
<Hoveround> is there an email or chat log where he expresses his feelings on he page?
<Pokchu> What?
<Hoveround> Pokchu, i will clarify
<Pokchu> no
<cirrus> ZeroUser: what has he told you?
<Pokchu> I mean What? at Zero
<BURK> zerouser you say that you try not to pry and here you are
<ZeroUser> ill ask him next time hes on, i log everything simce im paranoid like that so that isnt a problem
<Pokchu> How do you know that he's not just trying to get attention?
<Hoveround> so you havent already asked?
<Hoveround> and if so, please paste the log
<Pokchu> You're now acting like you don't know the extent of it
<cirrus> ZeroUser: if you log everything, do you have any logs now?
<Hoveround> of his response
<BURK> you vandalized a page on ed, then claim you have no contact with the aforementioned darkfox
<Pokchu> and you're just going by his word
<ZeroUser> he doesnt want attention, he pushes people away and isolates himself, its not atention
<Pokchu> see
<BURK> then no one would know of him
<BURK> and the page wouldnt exist
<Pokchu> that's an attention grabbing technique
<cirrus> you said you are close to him, this is paradoxical
<Hoveround> �i move that ZeroUser immediatly provide evidence darkfox is aware of the page and it has affected him
<cirrus> seconded
* ninjagumby is now known as SECOND
<BURK> yes
<BURK> seconded
<Hoveround> motion carried
* SECOND is now known as ninjagumby
<ZeroUser> he didnt leave his room in SL for an entire week once untill i pulled him out to a sandbox to shoot shit
<Pokchu> because then people think that he is trying to push them away, and they try to help him
<BURK> preferably photographic evidence of the accused with a sign saying "IHBTBED"
<Pokchu> he whines out "I AM VERY MENTALLY DISTURBED LEAVE ME ALONE"
<Pokchu> LOL
<cirrus> "i have aspergers syndrome!"
<ZeroUser> lets see if i can find my chat logs
<Pokchu> HE WOULDN'T COME OUT OF HIS E-ROOM
<BURK> zerouser if hes on secondlife i will find him myself
<cirrus> ZeroUser: thank you
<BURK> would you rather i find him
<BURK> or would you rather you find him
<ZeroUser> good luck finding him
<Hoveround> let ZeroUser pull the chatlogs (or type them hastily in notepad)
<eppigy> His room in SL?
<Hoveround> so we can see evidence of any effect the page has
<eppigy> what the fuck does that mean?
<DLB> eppigy: you can have virtual pieces of property and shit on second life
<eppigy> jesus
<DLB> in other words, he didn't leave his e-room or irl-room for a week
<ZeroUser> hes part of a family that owns alot of land and a very large house, we all have a room
<eppigy> awesome
<BURK> eppigy yes the advancement of internets disease in this case is terribly advanced
<DLB> Zero: what do you mean family?
<ZeroUser> hes got one of the biggest in the house
<DLB> you mean on second life?
<Pokchu> You're family?
<eppigy> ZeroUser: you mean on the internet right?
<ZeroUser> yes
<eppigy> ok
<Pokchu> E-family
<eppigy> please specify that
<Hoveround> Pokchu  - e-family
<eppigy> it is not reality
<Pokchu> Hoveround: hivemind
<ZeroUser> its more of an RP family but thats how we are twards each other
<BURK> zerouser where is said family and what are the names of these family members
<Hoveround> indeed, pok
<BURK> zerouser 
<BURK> have you ever met him in person
<BURK> talked to him on the phone
* ZeroUser is now known as CrimsonWings_Eun
<CrimsonWings_Eun> thats my SL name
<DLB> why do you have an online RP family?
<Pokchu> um
<CrimsonWings_Eun> just call me crim
<Pokchu> ok
<DLB> ok crim
<DLB> why do you have an online RP family?
<CrimsonWings_Eun> thank you
<DLB> np
<Hoveround> permission from arb to contiue referring to him as Zerouser
<CrimsonWings_Eun> because it gives me something to waste my time on
<BURK> crim, do you know of internets desease?
<Pokchu> Crim, all you need to do is provide sturdy evidence that Darkfox is deeply mentally disturbed
<Pokchu> and the article goes
<CrimsonWings_Eun> i wont respond if you do
<Pokchu> Otherwise he's just being an attention whore
<CrimsonWings_Eun> lol leave me alone for a sec to dig my logs
<DLB> i agree with pokchu
<BURK> yes, a picture of slit writsts, him holding antidepressants
<Pokchu> ok
<BURK> maybe in a diaper with a gun to his head
<DLB> half the people claiming mental illness etc on the internet are just attention whores
-> *BURK* lol
<DLB> and in that case totally deserve an article
<Pokchu> DLB speaks truth
*BURK* pokchu i need you to rewrite his article
*BURK* make up shit
*BURK* whatever
*BURK* but we need to front page it
<DLB> moar like 99% really
-> *BURK* I'm not into making up shit, but sure, I can try making it lulzier
<BURK> this is truth
<BURK> zerouser having a house in sl dosent mean one is mentaly disturbed
<BURK> it means one is a potential threat to the aryan race, but not mentaly disturbed
<Hoveround> CrimsonWings_Eun - please provide those logs now
<BURK> we need evidence
<DLB> BURK: hold plz, he's digging for logs
<cirrus> ninjagumby is requesting voice
<DLB> so he says anyway
<Hoveround> ok
<CrimsonWings_Eun> yea i know but if your there to talk to him and observe his actions you would understand
<DLB> how can you tell what his actions etc are really when all you are looking at is an avatar?
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun  we dont know where he is
<Hoveround> what we need to observe now is any solid evidence having a page on ED has affected him at all>
<BURK> if he was here
<BURK> we could observe his actions
<BURK> and then we might take the article down
<DLB> or if you were to show us where he resides in SL we could see for ourselves
<CrimsonWings_Eun> ill tell him you want to talk next time hes on
<DLB> even interview him if he wants
<cirrus> ninjagumby /r/ voice
-> *BURK* I bet my life savings that this ends in the article just getting longer and lulzier
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun do you think we are retarded?
<BURK> we arent
<BURK> we are resmarted
<BURK> we know better then that
<ajt> I am retarded
<Hoveround> this is going in circles. i'm going to motion again for an adjournment
<DLB> ajt: im sorry :(
<ajt> Hoveround: good idea
<ajt> tell fagly faggerson to produce the furry
<Hoveround> ajt is that a second
<DLB> second'd
<BURK> ajt you take pills for that tho rite?
<ajt> and we will start again
<CrimsonWings_Eun> im just answering questions
<Hoveround> motion is carried, arbchat will adjourn
<Pokchu> So yeah, get Darkfox in here
* ninjagumby has left #arbchat
<Hoveround> until darkfox can respresent himself
<ajt> I have a question for you fagly faggersone
<cirrus> and provide chatlogs
<ajt> just how fucked up are you?
<BURK> ok i nominate the page be revised
<CrimsonWings_Eun> darkie has since moved out to allow another resident to use the room while hes away
<BURK> and front paged
<cirrus> BURK: yes
<Hoveround> seconding that motion
<BURK> until said furry appears in arbchat
<Pokchu> Crim: Away where
<ajt> yeah
<ajt> this archat is concluded
<Hoveround> motion carried. [[darkfox]] to be frontpaged
<CrimsonWings_Eun> i said hes taking a break from SL to play WoW
<Pokchu> you made it sound like he was away on vacation
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun why dont i want to believe you?
<cirrus> can anyone find him on WoW?
<BURK> also 
<BURK> what is his wow name
<CrimsonWings_Eun> not sure what his WoW name is but i can ask
<cirrus> please do
<CrimsonWings_Eun> aint a problem
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun what is your wow name
<CrimsonWings_Eun> i dont play wow on the official servers
<BURK> and how are you communicating with said furry
<CrimsonWings_Eun> we communicate through SLs offline messaging system
<Pokchu> he seems to have deleted his myspace and taken down his FA submissions
<CrimsonWings_Eun> really? thats bad
<cirrus> BURK: can you communicate with him through similar system?
<DLB> lol DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING
-> *BURK* the only way we can add more to the article is by getting more information out of Zero here
<BURK> cirrus likely
-> *BURK* we must pretend that he is our friend
<BURK> ill fire up second life later 
<BURK> and search for him
-> *BURK* and that giving us info will get the page taken town
<cirrus> BURK: affirmative
<Pokchu> tell you what Crim
<CrimsonWings_Eun> um burk

* Pokchu sets mode: +b *!*@l0ld0ngs-9BE4D858.dyn.iinet.net.au

<anomic> your name is cirrus now, is it?
<cirrus> anomic: what Maxipad said
<Hoverround> anomic  - CrimsonWings_Eun is either a concerned friend of [[darkfox]] who wants a page reoval, or [[darkfox]] himself
<Hoverround> we're waiting for some kind of verification
<anomic> Hoverround: so he's a fgt?
<cirrus> this has yet to be 100% confirmed
<anomic> but confidence is high?
<CrimsonWings_Eun> whats not confirmed?
<Hoverround> anomic this is #arbchat, not some faggery daggery doo slinging match. call him a faggot on #ED if you need to :P

<Pokchu> Sheneequa: please ban SoulOfRights for page blanking
<Hoverround> CrimsonWings_Eun you could. in fact thats what a few of us are expecting you to do
<CrimsonWings_Eun> or i could use a proxy, or spoof my ip, or a whole buch of other things

<BURK> sherrod furfag here says he blanked his furfag buddies page
<Pokchu> Sherrod: ok
<Pokchu> PM?
<CrimsonWings_Eun> -_- im not a furfag
<BURK> to keep the mental trauma from ruining him
<cirrus> CrimsonWings_Eun: sadly, your DA says different
<CrimsonWings_Eun> im looking atm my own DA and that a copy and paste
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun tell me, did you make this image: http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/55905978/
<CrimsonWings_Eun> uh huh
<cirrus> furry confirmation 100%
<BURK> DO YOU CONFIRM OR DENY THAT YOU MADE THIS IMAGE WHICH IS LIKELY THE DARKFOX IN QUESTION: http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/55593959/
<Hoverround> so gay
<Hoverround> + furry drawing
<Hoverround> =furfag
<BURK> hoverround this is truth
<Sherrod> i have a question
<CrimsonWings_Eun> hey thats josi
<Sherrod> CrimsonWings_Eun: are you a homosexual?
<CrimsonWings_Eun> yes
<CrimsonWings_Eun> i made that pic for him as some hart for his SL home
<BURK> and do you at least draw furrys
<BURK> and wear a furry av in second life
<CrimsonWings_Eun> na those are edited screenies from SL
<Sherrod> wait... you wear a fursuit in SL?
<CrimsonWings_Eun> what i  think there cute
<BURK> DO YOU WEAR A FURRY AVATAR IN SECOND LIFE YES OR NO
<CrimsonWings_Eun> ya
<BURK> that is a confirmation of both being a furry and a homosexual
<BURK> so by definition you are a furfag
<cirrus> you are thusly pronounced a furfag
<Sherrod> wow
<Sheneequa> straight furries exist
<Sheneequa> they are just not true furries
<BURK> sheneequa truth
* Sheneequa sets mode: +o Sherrod
<CrimsonWings_Eun> they do but are only bout 15% of the fandom
<cirrus> Sheneequa: i know at least one
<cirrus> and he is cool
* eppigy has quit IRC (Quit: Lost terminal�)
<CrimsonWings_Eun> i know 3
<DLB> cirrus: does not compute
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun so you no longer deny being a furry
<Sherrod> CrimsonWings_Eun is telling a lot of lies
<CrimsonWings_Eun> the reason i wear an furry AV in sL is because i think there cute, thats about as deep as my involement in the fandom goes
<cirrus> CrimsonWings_Eun: do you believe that furries are being unfairly prosecuted for their "obsession"? the common term being "fursecution"?
<Sherrod> which is quite against the spirit of the arbchat process
<Sheneequa> CrimsonWings_Eun
<Sheneequa> at one point
<Sheneequa> in the arbchat
<Sheneequa> you said *facepaws*
<Sheneequa> Now
<Sheneequa> why would a human say facepaws
<Sheneequa> Humans do NOT HAVE PAWS
<Sheneequa> you are a furfag who uses faggy emotes, QED
<DLB> also: since you are not humans, you are not protected under the geneva conventions
<DLB> hence fursecution is aaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwright
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun tell me, do you believe that jews flew 2 jet liners into the world trade center towers on september the 11th 2001
<DLB> BURK: i know i do
<Sheneequa> don't forget one into the pentagon
<DLB> and a random field
<DLB> just for the lulz
<BURK> dlb no 
<Sheneequa> and brave AMERICANS wrestled the controls away from the plane headed for the white house
<Sherrod> and one  into an undergorund bunker in pennsylvania
<BURK> aryan warriors fought back
<DLB> hahaha
<DLB> irlol'd
<CrimsonWings_Eun> racist much?
<cirrus> for truth and justice!
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun SAY YES OR NO
<cirrus> Crimson: we speak only the truth
<Sheneequa> CrimsonWings_Eun: it is not racist at all
<BURK> YES JEWS DID WTC OR NO THEY DIDNT
<Sheneequa> Germans did the holocaust right?
<Sheneequa> is that racist against Germans?
<DLB> U MEAN THE LOLLERCAUST
<Sheneequa> jews did wtc
<Sheneequa> it is truth
<Sheneequa> also they prolly did the holocaust too
<BURK> just like how you are a furfag
<CrimsonWings_Eun> im not a fur i just like the AVs
<BURK> 1 + 1 = 2
<BURK> its simple to understand
<cirrus> I'm not gay, i just like sticking my penis in men's asses
<Sheneequa> -1*-1=-1
<Sherrod> CrimsonWings_Eun: what is your purpose for this arbchat?
<DLB> furry + fag = furfag
<cirrus> I'm not racist, I just hate niggers
<DLB> Sherrod: to take down [[furry]] and [[Darkfox]]
<BURK> cirrus irlol
<Sheneequa> to take down furry?
<Sheneequa> what
<Sheneequa> what
<BURK> sherrod he blanked darkfox earlier
<CrimsonWings_Eun> actualy i just want the furry section amended
<DLB> he was all butthurt about that and blanked both earlier
<cirrus> Crimson blanked it under the name ZeroUser
<Pokchu> Sheneequa:I think he knows it's not going
<Sheneequa> lololol
<BURK> claiming the "victim" of said article was mentaly disturbed
<Sherrod> CrimsonWings_Eun: if you're not a furry, why do you care?
<DLB> ie: emo attention whore
<CrimsonWings_Eun> because many of my freinds are
<cirrus> you forgot teen angst
<Sheneequa> CrimsonWings_Eun your chances of winning are equal to the chance of surviving WTC
<Sheneequa> 17/3000
<cirrus> LOL
<DLB> LOL
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun is it because your mom only bakes brownies?
<Pokchu> LOL
<BURK> LOL
<Hoverround> CrimsonWings_Eun are you darkfox?
<DLB> JEWS ATE HIS PIE
<CrimsonWings_Eun> heh
<DLB> ONLY BROWNIES FOR YOU
<Sheneequa> LOL
<Pokchu> Hover: It's pretty obvious he's not at this point
<BURK> pokchu im not so sure
<CrimsonWings_Eun> thank you
<BURK> we dont have darkfoxes DA
<Sheneequa> who is logging this arbchat
<Pokchu> still though
<Hoverround> i remain unconvinced
<cirrus> Crimson: it has been over an hour, where is darkfox?
<Sheneequa> who is logging this arbchat
<Pokchu> Sheneequa: I am
<BURK> shen cirrus
<cirrus> Sheneequa: I have it
<Sheneequa> kk
<Hoverround> there is evidence both ways
<DLB> ditto
<Pokchu> yes
<Sheneequa> when this is done maybe we can snoop out some lol quotes
<Pokchu> get darkfox in here now
<DLB> so we have X3 on arbchatlol
<DLB> shenne: oh there are some gems in har
<cirrus> Sheneequa: I already have one up on [[darkfox]]
<Pokchu> the only way for this to go anywhere is for you to bring in Darkfox
<BURK> shen ooooh we have some
<cirrus> about the SL hugbox
<Pokchu> so get him in here
* Sheneequa is now known as facepaws
* facepaws *
<Pokchu> lol
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun you do understand that you have doomed darkfox unless you bring him here right?
*Hoverround* can u pls unban me from my other hostmask
<DLB> *facepaws*
-> *Hoveround* fine
* Pokchu sets mode: -b *!*@l0ld0ngs-9BE4D858.dyn.iinet.net.au
<DLB> we will just front page that article for as long as it takes to get him here
<CrimsonWings_Eun> meh im trying
* Hoveround has joined #arbchat
<DLB> and make it even moar vicious
* Hoverround was kicked by Pokchu (Pokchu�)
* Hoverround has joined #arbchat
<BURK> we will lie
* Hoverround has quit IRC (Quit: *facepaws*�)
<DLB> haha
<facepaws> kekekeke
<DLB> oh god
<CrimsonWings_Eun> lol hes not even any where near a PC at this point so whats it matter?
<DLB> new meme?
<BURK> we will make up shit you cant even imagine
<facepaws> I love facepaws
*Hoveround* thx
<DLB> iawtc
<Pokchu> lol facepaws
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun it mattered enough for you to delete it didnt it?
* cirrus *facepaws* facepaws
<CrimsonWings_Eun> matters to me because i see it
<BURK> you realize that ed is one of the top ranked sites on the internet right
<BURK> and that now your freinds ed page will be at the top of google
<Pokchu> well
<Pokchu> once it's front paged anyway
*Hoveround* sorry if it sounded like i was being authoritative before, it was actually how i conducted #arbchats which got me permanat ops in #ED in the first place
<DLB> i thought you said he was mentally distressed over the article
*Hoveround* i just hate it when people talk in circles (when it isnt lulzy)
<DLB> and he couldn't come in here and do this himself?
-> *Hoveround* It's okay, ilu still
<CrimsonWings_Eun> parents....
<BURK> and now thanks to you CrimsonWings_Eun he will get even more fursecution
<cirrus> i don't understand
<BURK> and likely suicide with bricks and knives
<cirrus> he was playing WoW earlier and now his parents are angry because of irc?
<cirrus> or am i wrong?
<DLB> who knows
<Pokchu> I vote for Darkfox to be AOTN the 17th and the 18th until Darkfox himself gets here
<Pokchu> all in favor?
<BURK> and they let him have a room in secondlife
<cirrus> seconded
<Hoveround> i second
<BURK> you say that like he owns land
<Hoveround> motion carrier
<Hoveround> motion carried
<cirrus> motion carrier!
<cirrus> release drones
<cirrus> VICTORY
<Sherrod> heh
<Sherrod> you people are like a pack of wolves
<BURK> if he owns land and plays wow, and has the computer and internet connection required for those things
<BURK> that means his parents give him a considerable ammount of money
<CrimsonWings_Eun> he doesnt own lad
<Hoveround> i still want to see verifiable evidence that CrimsonWings_Eun isnt Darkfox
<cirrus> Sherrod: isn't it beautiful?
<BURK> not very likely of abusive parents
<Hoveround> there is NOTHING conclusive presented yet
<CrimsonWings_Eun> its group owned and he part of the group
<DLB> crim: can i have irl pix of you so i can fap to it while reading the logs of this arbchat?
<DLB> crim: can i have irl pix of you so i can fap to it while reading the logs of this arbchat?
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun he still has a wow account
<BURK> and abusive parents wouldnt buy their kid a pc to begin with
<CrimsonWings_Eun> true but GL finding him
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun thanks to you we have his sl name
<CrimsonWings_Eun> and didnt i say he would be back later today?
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun you say a lot 
<cirrus> you said he would be back in an hour
<BURK> but have little to show
<cirrus> it is now an hour
<CrimsonWings_Eun> ones SL name is easy to find
<Pokchu> yes
<Pokchu> I highly doubt that Darkfox really gets abused
<cirrus> it is an acute case of 17 year old teen angst
<Pokchu> yup
<cirrus> mom won't let him stay up to watch avril lavigne videos
<cirrus> and eat brownies
<facepaws> dude every 17 year old in the world has abusive parents
<Pokchu> cirrus: but avril does bubblegum pop now
<CrimsonWings_Eun> whatever
<BURK> CrimsonWings_Eun you dont know abuse
<Pokchu> He probably has no IRL friends, so he pretends to be dark and disturbed so people try to offer him help
<BURK> i have a freind
<cirrus> Pokchu: apparently. i have heard/seen it once
<BURK> who lives in argentina
<cirrus> it was disturbing
<BURK> who has never kissed a man
<DLB> I KNOW ABUSE
<Pokchu> cirrus: true
<DLB> and nagas
<BURK> but has been raped 3 times
<Pokchu> lok

<Hoveround> youve been 'looking' for an hour

<BURK> grim
<cirrus> well Darkfox seems to take his internet very seriously indeed
<BURK> we will ruin you too

<BURK> we arent your average trolls
<cirrus> Crim: you have given us more than enough ammunition
<Crim> go
<Crim> fire away
<Crim> im tired of dealinh with his whiny ass
<BURK> crim tell me, 
<BURK> have you ever talked to him outside of the internet
<Crim> no nor do i want to?
<BURK> outside of this little furry clique of yours
<BURK> then you have done nothing for him
* Pokchu is now known as PokAFK
<BURK> but bring ruin upon him by coming here
<cirrus> Crim: you are a basement dweller and are not "friends" with Darkfox at all
<Hoveround> [09:36] <BURK> have you ever talked to him outside of the internet
<Hoveround> [09:36] <Crim> no nor do i want to?
<BURK> and we all know you have an advanced case of internets disease
<Hoveround> you spent so much time trying to get us to remove the page
<cirrus> you "know" him, but have no personal connection to him other than being a fellow furfag
<BURK> there is no way you will just leave the internet
<Hoveround> and now suddenly you're like "go ahead i dont care lol"
<Crim> im done with him
<BURK> it wont be long before we find your phone number and tell your parents about how you like to dress up as an animal on the internet and fuck horsemen
<BURK> crim do you know of sokitwopaw?
<cirrus> we have done it before

<Crim> thats hharassment and you can be sued for it
<BURK> crim lolololol

<cirrus> ED has yet to suffer any lawsuit
<BURK> "THE DEFENDANT CALLED ME A COCK MONGLER"
<cam> cirrus: no
<cam> There was a law suit once
<cirrus> and would you like it to be legal knowledge that you dress up like an animal on the internet and fuck horses?
<cirrus> cam: oh, why was i unaware of this?
<BURK> also didnt weev go to court with the nathanr drama or something?
<Hoveround> oh god

<BURK> crim
<BURK> no court would take this
<BURK> remember that you and your furfag freinds are still sexual deviants
<cirrus> Crim: would you really like to involve yourself in a lawsuit that would most definitely include shitting dick niples
<BURK> hell sodomy is illegal in kentucky isnt it?
<cam> FACT: Sherrod generates controversy by simply existing.
* DLB has quit IRC (Quit: FIGHT THE ZOG MACHINE�)
<cirrus> cam: only on your planet :P
<cam> truth
<BURK> anyone else notice how crims ip and hostmask changed?
<cirrus> anyway, Crim, I do believe you are seriously underestimating that which is ED
<cam> but really though, how would someone know that Sherrod = Grivinyl without being told or having been in the ED Government
<cam> Disregard the fact that like three people told me straight up
<cirrus> well, you go to [[Girlvinyl]] and it redirects to [[Sherrod]]
<cam> i never go to [[Grilvinyl]] though
<cirrus> you might
<cirrus> i ended up on it once, i think there was a promise of noods

<Hoveround> there is other evidence that suggests he is in OH
<Crim> im using a web based client as im sure you can tell
<Hoveround> such as the ARIN record for the IP he is connecting on
<Hoveround> but this could be laziness on behalf of cin bell

<Hoveround> Crim's ip is reporting as located in Cincinnati OH, at Lat 39.0975, Long -84.4720
