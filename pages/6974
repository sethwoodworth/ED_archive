Rhode Island
[[Image:Bluebug.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Everyone in Rhode Island thinks the Big Blue Bug is hilarious. That is because they are [[unfunny]] and [[boring]]]]
'''Rhode Island''' is a small, [[wop|dago]]-infested principality on the east coast of the United States. This makes it like an [[Americunt]] version of Monaco, but instead of [[hookers and blow]] and people who are [[rich and beautiful]], Rhode Island is filled with [[faggots]], [[Child Abuse|Child Boxing]], [[Liberal]]s and [[fail]]. In terms of size, it's basically a suburb of Massachusetts, or a glorified county at best. It takes 17 minutes to drive through Rhode Island.


==[[People]]==
Rhode Island is entirely run by the [[mafia]]. The National Guard and police are solely composed of fat guys named "Vinny," "Tony," and "Vito" who wear leather jackets and chains, even in their uniforms. [[Irony|Ironically]], there is no crime in Rhode Island, at least of the unorganized variety. This is because Rhode Island posts guards at its borders with Connecticut to keep out any black persons. Should any black persons or [[faggot]]s slip in, it is these guards' duty to beat them into comas. Some black persons have slipped into Central Falls and Pawtucket; these places are best avoided at all costs. 

Rhode Island's capital Providence, like [[Washington, DC]], has a [[erection|boner]] for electing felons as Mayor. One of their mayors, Buddy Cianci, was sent to jail [[last Thursday]]. After he got out of jail, he was promptly elected as Mayor, only to be [[v&]] again a few years later. To make up for it, the good citizens of Providence then elected an admitted [[faggot]] in his stead. Said faggot then outlawed straight secks, excluding Barrington.  

Naturally, all of Rhode Island is composed of [[liberal]] ginzos. [[H.P. Lovecraft]] is also buried here. This means that at any given moment, you can find fat [[goth|goffik]] chicks cutting themselves at his gravesite and attempting to practice [[Wicca]] with their fat, clumsy hands, while nervously keeping an eye out for the aforementioned police.

==[[Culture]]==
[[Image:Tubeham.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Downtown Providence: pictured above.]]
Since Rhode Island is about the size of a trailer park, only [[dwarf|dwarves]], [[Furry|furries]] and [[You|hipsters]] can live there comfortably. More human inhabitants crawl and run endlessly on [[hamster]] wheels and through plastic tubes in the local transportation system, eventually transforming into [[otherkin]]. They use these tubes to visit brightly colored phallic monuments. Backgammon is also popular.

Rhode Islanders, dazed by the bright, shiny colors and slippery surface of the plastic tubes, are among the worst drivers in the nation. The equivalent can be seen by dangling a box of Ding Dongs over a mining shaft full of retards and homeless people.

Since the great [[Furmeet]] of 1929, [[Liberalism|Democrats]] have declared [[Anal|sodomy]] and [[Oral|cunnilingus]] to be legal. This was probably an apology to the black people, because Rhode Island was a major port for slavery in [[at least 100 years ago|ancient times]]. Up until 2009, [[whore|prostitution]] was legal. Then [[Your Mom|someone]] decided it was bad and shit and [[The Man|The Man]] outlawed it.

===[[Music]]===
The entire state of Rhode Island is about as big as your [[Cock#Clinical Micropenis|cock]], and as such is equally disappointing and boring. To combat this, every resident is part of a shitty 'alternative' rock band. You would think that with 1 million people playing guitar all day long, some talent would come out of Rhode Island. Instead you will only find [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badfish shitty cover bands] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_Tick_%28band%29 sell outs].

==Cities==
Rhode Island isn't big enough to have any cities. There is a combination mini-mall and convention center called Providence. Both are made out of empty [[Japan|Miso]] barrels. As the area is littered with faggots, every street is a catwalk. 

Rhode Island is also home to Newport, which is where the [[rich and beautiful]] lived before [[the internet]]. Newport is also where the Jew cancer started spreading in [[United States|Amerikkka]] as home to the United States's first synagogue. Undoubtedly, Jews came to Newport first because they were instinctively drawn to the concentration of [[money]]. They also still make [[cigarettes]] there.

===Olneyville===
The great <strike>city</strike> <strike>town</strike> <strike>village</strike> [[Ghetto|ghetto]] is known for contributing 5 murders to Rhode Island every year. Oddly enough, and surely unrelated, there are only 5 [[Permaban|murders]] every year in the entire state. Olneyville is filled with [[Spics|rodents]], [[Niggers|chicken]], and [[Ugly|cute]] [[old|little]] [[Whores|girls]]. Like any great ghetto, there are "turf" wars. However, unlike every other ghetto, the current war was started by really cool [[Hipsters|college students]] who are trying to take back land from the [[Nigras|current owners]] and [[Buttsecks|stick it to The Man]]. Several warehouses have been converted by [[White trash|unique individuals]] into underground music venues where underage drinking and [[Pedophilia|child prostitution]] are <strike>common</strike> unheard of.

===Woonsocket===

Considered the cultural capital of Rhode Island, residents here exhibit the same social graces as in Kabul. All vehicles driven in town are at least twenty-five years old, both men and women display artistic tattoos on at least 75% of their bodies, and cigarette smoking is an art. Millions of tourists flock to Woonsocket each year to observe the parade of motorcyclists on their way to Dunkin' Donuts. Cultural events include visits to [[Grossman's Bargain Outlet]], lining up to purchase lottery tickets and walking to liquor stores twice daily for a dozen six-packs of beer. Woonsocket also has the safest and most mature drivers in America: average speed and driver's age are 3.7 mph and 93 years old, respectively.

Being as homosexual as they are, the people of Woonsocket have an unhealthy obsession with hot dogs. No less then four hundred wiener dispensers serve Phallus-shaped meat drizzled in liquid meat shit. Every diner is filled with at least one fat woman without a bra and cock-eyed redhead.

Every citizen of Woonksocket is a product of [[wincest|incest]].

Picking up a hooker in Woonsocket is easy. Go to the Arena Cafe (or any bar in Woonsocket) and offer any woman $10 for fifteen minutes in your car. If you know the other person's name, paying for secks is legal in Rhode Island, since there is no other way to do the secks with a non-cousin.

==Edumacations==
Rhode Island is on the border of the oceans that once covered the hellhole of Connecticut (unfortunetly the water receded) and to the north borders the Glorious Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which many argue Rhode Island is just a county of. Like [[Michael Jackson]]'s ambiguous gender, Massetuseetes has no real spelling. Just like Attleboro can also be spelled Attleborough or Fiona Apple. Massive-[[tit]]-usettes was ranked as one of the most intelligent states in all of USSR but this intelligence has not rubbed off on it's small southern county of Rhode Island unlike the [[AIDS]] that rubbed off on it from its black person shipments. Rhode Island is the premature, deformed fetus of Massachusetts and as such is woefully lacking in the edumacations. If you would like to get some edumacations in the manic state of Rhode Island, here is a short list of schools.

*University of Rhode Island: Abbreviated as "URI." The fact that everyone attending this school is an unrepentant retarded idiot is no coincidence. A few rich, militant, token, Che-dick-sucking, "don't say that word around me" faggots/whores go here, but the student body is primarily middle-class, middle-of-the-road white throwaways who couldn't get in anywhere else. Favorite campus activities include sleeping with ugly chicks and bragging about it while drunk, sitting on the hoods of moving cars while drunk, shouting about how drunk you are while drunk, smoking crappy three-month-old weed from your bro's sister's boyfriend while drunk, and deserving to be drug out into the street and shot...while sober. According to esteemed sources like tweaking homeless people, it is an "acclaimed institution with an outstanding reputation." A degree from this school is worth as much as any state school, so basically, congratulations on wasting your life. 
*Johnson and Wales: A place where you learn to make PB and J sandwiches while learning such precious skills as [[fellatio|hospitality]]. Run by hungry [[Jews]].
*Brown University: The students here are either insanely [[rich]] [[WASP]] cocaine addicts, incredibly wealthy Jew [[Rachel Corrie|activists]] who despite their privileged upbringing ironically become [[communist]]s, [[dying alone|socially inept]] [[asspies]] who fap to [[furry]] porn and [[shota]], [[scenester]] fags and everyone else. Although an Ivy League university supposedly full of intellectual dialogue, all conversations here devolve into the equivalent of a Wikipedia talk page about [[shit nobody cares about]], which can actually result in some hilarious IRL [[flame wars]] and drama. 
*Providence College: Run by the Dominicans, an order of priests who were charged with burning Jews [[IRL]] during the Middle Ages. Note that the Dominicans consume more alcohol than the entire student body: a hooch cabinet comprises an entire wall in the priory lounge. The students are split down the middle between drunk [[jock]] wiggers who like to blow their shitty jungle music out of their dorm [[windows]] and religious idiots who think the pope is infallible and earnestly pray for [[Raptor Jesus]] to overthrow [[ZOG]]. The male drunkards are known to have ridiculously small penises that become erect only with the presence of clergy. They also enjoy [[teabagging]] each other in their spare time, and high-fiving over how well they 69-rimmed each other the night previous. The female drunkards also have small penises which become erect in the presence of little boy ass. Each 5th of July, they choose one lucky member of the college community to be fired from Providence into the bedroom of the [[Pope]] (AKA The Emperor) for sodomy and a tour of the Dark Side of The Force Studios where [[gay]] and [[furry]] porn are pumped out. 
*[[Art School|RISD]]: Filled with [[pretentious]] [[scenester]]s who <del>may or may not be</del> are [[faggot]]s. However, unlike their counterparts at Brown, they spend more time on actually putting [[cock]] [[in the ass]] than engaging in typical [[attention whore]] [[angst]] about their [[homo|sexuality]].
*Moses Brown: A school where rich faggots send their spoiled brats. It was founded [[at least 100 years ago]] by the guy on the Quaker Oats box. Students at Moses Brown receive a well-rounded edumacation in being an [[criminal|asshole]], taking advantage of poor people, and [[Buddhism|sitting around being self-absorbed]]. The school claims to have after-school programs that are acclaimed state-wide, which isn't hard to do since Rhode Island is of the size and quality of my fungus-infested toenail.
*Lincoln School: A school full of whores in skanky uniforms. The girls who go there are all either [[lesbians]] or take it up the ass from boys who go to Moses Brown.
*Mount Saint Charles Academy: A school in Woonsocket that excels at hockey and shower buttsecks. The Brothers of the Sacred Cock rape 128% of students who attend the Mount. Brother Roy was well known for raping young men in the showers, especially if they were quadnipped.

==Rhode Island's place in LULZ==

*The Station Night Club: The only interesting thing to happen here was in West Warwick. The hairband [[Semen|Great White]] decided to play a show in a small bar and thought it was a good idea to use large fireworks on a small stage. The result: [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|The bar burns down and a hundred people die]]. Four days earlier, twenty-one nigras had died in a nightclub disaster in Chicago. This shows that when it comes to fatal nightclub infernos, [[Truth|White People are superior]]. Rhode Island truly earned its place as hosting the fourth deadliest nightclub fire in the world.[[Image:stationnightclubfire.jpg|thumb|The first and last time anybody gave a shit about Rhode Island.]]

*The Great Flood of 2010: [[At least 100 years ago|A long time ago]], some intelligent person had the great idea to build [[Over 9000|billions]] of houses and businesses next the Pawtuxet River. [[Sarcasm|Obviously]] no one could predict that even the smallest amount of rain would raise water levels to a catastrophic degree. The end result caused [[Death of a Meme|over 9000]] in damage and the streets were filled with the dead bodies of bunnies and kitties o noez, but at least no one has to listen to that awful Warwick Mall jingle anymore. The Warwick Mall Jingle was so horrible that the day it was written, God made plans to flood the entire mall and murder the song writer. With hundreds of people homeless, the [[Swastika|Red Cross]] stepped in, along with the [[National_Guard|National Guard]], to pass out checks and hotel vouchers. This lead to massive hotel parties involving many [[Hookers_and_Blow|party favors]].
