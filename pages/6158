* '''Brisbane Raid was conducted with moderate win, a person from the council tried to get all 50 of us to stand in a 5m square while the police watched us from a distance.  hundreds of fliers were handed out and many people came over and had in depth talks with us and became very educated about our cause.  at one point someone drove past and yelled out "DO A BARREL ROLL!". a Scientologist plant was discovered watching us from the Coffee Club across the street and with some anonymous tipoff the staff asked him to leave. Almost all anonymous wore masks and carried out the protest with vigor. The peaceful protest broke up at around 1420hrs when our stocks of fliers were exhausted.  moar photos can be seen here: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/23719058@N08/ BrisbAnon flickr photos]'''

'''"At least 40 people [initially met] at the meeting point." at 1pm. This ended up being somewhere between 60-100 [some say up to 200 different people over the course of the day] (reports vary, but 'over 60-80' seems like a good figure) before finish at 4pm. Plenty of flier handing out, plenty of pictures/video footage. The public was generally pretty receptive.'''

'''They even got a fire engine turning on its siren for them.'''

'''The Scientologists' PR department pulled the same shit that they tried with the Sydney protests, posting an article on indymedia.org claiming that violence had broken out and 10-15 were arrested (up from the near identical one they issued with Sydney stating that 2 of the 10-20 protesters had been arrested). The photos used were from the Halliburton Shareholders Protest in Houston in 2005 from the same site. I mean, are they too stupid/stressed/??? that they couldn't even get AUSTRALIAN riot pictures?'''

'''The Scilons hired security in Perth too, who approached the protesters and mentioned that "they have nothing against our cause, and are not particularly in favour of sci, they're just earning a dollar to put food on the table for their kids, so please don't show identifying footage of them." Cool.'''

'''There was a little bit of location issues / confusion in the planning stages of this raid, so it's good to see that anon truly is this versatile.'''

'''OSA / Some Scilon tailed one group (friend of the suspicious-looking trying-to-blend-in guy in red cap). Claimed it was "'His business to monitor [them]' because [they] were 'terrorists'. " Fortunately those involved have him on camera, so epic lulz will hopefully ensue. "'''
