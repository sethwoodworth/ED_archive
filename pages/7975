== And Cadnocat Called Forth The [[Internets]] Police ==

 [07:00] Irssi: Starting query in bantown with Cadnocat
 [07:00] <chimi> seriously
 [07:01] <chimi> you can't sue him for identity theft for you leaving
 your wallet at his house
 [07:01] <Cadnocat> you can under australian law
 [07:01] <chimi> because of your own mistake?
 [07:01] <chimi> no
 [07:09] <chimi> cadno
 [07:09] <Cadnocat> i've shut up on the topic
 [07:09] <Cadnocat> i'll let the courts sort it out
 [07:09] <Cadnocat> i'm prosecuting tommorrow
 [07:09] <chimi> i was actually going to ask for your side of the story
 [07:10] <Cadnocat> the fucker stole my wallet, then bragged about it on irc
 [07:10] <chimi> do you have logs?
 [07:10] <Cadnocat> hum... i dunno, i'll have to check
 [07:11] <chimi> do that
 [07:11] <chimi> :)
 [07:11] <Cadnocat> yah, well if the cops go to his house they'll find evidence
 [07:12] <chimi> evidence?
 [07:12] <Cadnocat> yah, like 10 pieces of identification he stole
 [07:12] <Cadnocat> lucky i stopped my damn cards
 [07:14] <chimi> credit cards?
 [07:14] <Cadnocat> yes
 [07:14] <Cadnocat> credit and debit
 [07:14] <chimi> why didn't you report it right away then?
 [07:15] <Cadnocat> i did
 [07:15] <Cadnocat> 48 hr response
 [07:15] <chimi> but why now are you pressing the issue?
 [07:15] <Cadnocat> but he revealed last night that not only did he
 have my wallet... but posted my deets on chan.
 [07:15] <Cadnocat> so basically he's very stupid
 [07:16] <chimi> well for him to post your dox you had to have done
 something to provoke him
 [07:16] <Cadnocat> i told him he was a rat maggot
 [07:16] <Cadnocat> which is what he is
 [07:17] <Cadnocat> further proved by what he did
 [07:17] <chimi> do you have your wallet now?
 [07:17] <Cadnocat> no
 [07:17] <Cadnocat> i already said, he stole itr
 [07:17] <Cadnocat> it
 [07:17] <chimi> when was all of this then?
 [07:17] <Cadnocat> about 2-3 months ago
 [07:18] <Cadnocat> if he's tried to use my cards, it will be shown
 [07:18] <Cadnocat> he better hope he hasn't
 [07:18] <chimi> don't take this the wrong way, but if this happened
 2-3 months ago, you should have taken care of it then
 [07:18] <Cadnocat> cos I"m going to fucking do a number on this serbian prick
 [07:18] <Cadnocat> yah, i cancelled the cards
 [07:18] <Cadnocat> and now he revealed he had my wallet
 [07:18] <Cadnocat> motherfucker
 [07:18] <Cadnocat> i'm seeing his ass in court tommorrow
 [07:19] <chimi> so if you cancelled the cards, there's no way he can
 commit identity theft
 [07:19] <Cadnocat> not under australian law
 [07:19] <chimi> you prevented any chance of it happening by cancelling the cards
 [07:19] <chimi> i'm not talking about australian law
 [07:19] <chimi> i'm talking about common sense
 [07:19] <Cadnocat> well we're both in australia
 [07:19] <Cadnocat> he commited a federal crime
 [07:19] <Cadnocat> and his ass is toast
 [07:19] <Cadnocat> and I will enjoy it
 [07:20] <Cadnocat> young punk try and take the piss out of an old-skooler
 [07:20] <chimi> hmm
 [07:21] <Cadnocat> he's getting WW3
 [07:21] <Cadnocat> motherfucker
 [07:22] <chimi> what exactly did he post
 [07:22] <Cadnocat> he posted my NIN and my credit card number
 [07:22] <Cadnocat> he's fucking toast
 [07:22] <chimi> do you have a screenshot of it?
 [07:22] <chimi> or is it still there?
 [07:22] <Cadnocat> my cousin is an australian barrister
 [07:23] <Cadnocat> it doesn't matter
 [07:23] <Cadnocat> andrew tells me he is down for 10
 [07:23] <Cadnocat> if I prosecute
 [07:23] <Cadnocat> and he just made it clear
 [07:23] <Cadnocat> that I have to
 [07:24] <chimi> well, if you have no proof of all of this
 [07:24] <chimi> i don't see how you can prosecute him
 [07:24] <Cadnocat> i've got logs
 [07:24] <Cadnocat> and he better wipe that machine fast
 [07:24] <chimi> what logs?
 [07:24] <Cadnocat> so even if it don't work out, he's lost my deets
 [07:26] <chimi> can i see your logs?
 [07:26] <chimi> you can star out personal #s if you want
 [07:26] <Cadnocat> i faxed them to Westpac... and they are on my other machine
 [07:27] <Cadnocat> that means a lot of cable-changing
 [07:27] <chimi> do you usually use that machine for irc?
 [07:27] <Cadnocat> nup, but I'd just got it repaired
 [07:27] <Cadnocat> and wanted to try it out
 [07:27] <Cadnocat> it's my interview machine
 [07:28] <chimi> i thought you wre good with computers though
 [07:28] <chimi> you don't have both hooked up?
 [07:29] <Cadnocat> nope... it's a single net connection
 [07:29] <Cadnocat> i dont waste money on ethernet
 [07:29] <chimi> you're on dsl aren't you?
 [07:29] <Cadnocat> yes
 [07:29] <Cadnocat> also, call it hacker protection
 [07:29] <Cadnocat> only one machine is allowed to be present on the net
 [07:29] <Cadnocat> one is strictly offline
 [07:30] <chimi> i see
 [07:30] <Cadnocat> that eastern european cunt is going to suffer bad
 [07:31] <chimi> no offense, but judging fromwhat you've told me
 [07:31] <chimi> i see no case
 [07:31] <chimi> and considering this is my field
 [07:31] <Cadnocat> oh there'll be a case
 [07:31] <chimi> i'm not bsing you
 [07:31] <Cadnocat> i know
 [07:31] <Cadnocat> i've only told you as much as I can
 [07:32] <Cadnocat> he picked the wrong guy this time
 [07:32] <chimi> like i said, based on what you've told me
 [07:32] <chimi> i see no case
 [07:32] <Cadnocat> like I've worked in the industry 10 years
 [07:32] <Cadnocat> ok
 [07:32] <Cadnocat> you believe that.. let's see what happens
 [07:32] <chimi> i'm not taking sides dude
 [07:32] <chimi> i asked for your side of the story
 [07:32] <chimi> i've already heard his
 [07:33] <chimi> i just don't want bitching and non-lulzy drama in the channel
 [07:33] <Cadnocat> unless he bins everything.. including my wallet
 tonight.. he's fucked
 [07:33] <chimi> it sounded like two girls going at it over some boy
 they had a crush on
 [07:33] <Cadnocat> that is basically my version of a warning
 [07:34] <Cadnocat> i've given him 24 hrs to bin that shit
 [07:34] <Cadnocat> if he still has it, the police WILL find it
 [07:36] <chimi> alrighty
