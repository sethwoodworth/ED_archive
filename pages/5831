'''Northern Ireland''' (known as '''Norn Iron''' to the locals) is a [[terrorist]] camp in the North of the Island of [[Ireland]], and that's the way it'll feckin' stay if you value yer kneecaps, right? It is generally thought to be fought over by the British and Irish governments by those within the "country", but unbeknownest they both really couldn't give a shite.

==History==

The history of the North is a complex and difficult one if you are a Northerner. To everyone else, it's a society divided between two sides of the population: on one side is a bunch of [[Psycho|psychotic]], unemployable, [[chav|white trash]] [[terrorist]] scumbags, who are eternally pitted against a bunch of [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1844540405/ref=sib_dp_bod_ex/104-6400449-3667953?ie=UTF8&p=S00H#reader-link psychotic], unemployable, [[chav|white trash]] [[terrorist]] [[catholic|scumbags]].
People from the North are famous for [[oclet|drinking]], [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108373/ fighting], owning armalites and wearing <s>ski masks</s> balaclavas (Keep your fail American language out of this page). Northern Ireland is governed by a really [[fat]] guy in a leather jacket who smuggles fuel from over the border and steals truckloads of [[fag]]s <s>(cigarettes to our American cousins)</s>(What did I just say?) to feed his six hundred a day habit.

==Diet==
The diet is inspired by that of the peasants of [[Scotland]] from which much of the population spawned from after being imported by the [[England|English]]. This diet consists mainly of Chips and in the absence of fish, Due to the large population of catholics, the [[goatse|orangemen]] eat babies. (this is widely believed to be the birthplace of [[Hitler]]s idea of [[Jews]] eating Aryan babies)

The famous [[suicide|Bobby Sands Diet]] was inspired by [[terrorist|Saint Bobby Sands]], Bishop of [[sheep|Irish-America]].

==Belfast (or Bellshaft)==

If you travel to the lovely and accepting land of Ulster you must go to Belfast! This city has it all, [[niggers|Romanian hobos]] who try to sell you shit you don't want, Romanian hobos who try to ask for money with out trying to sell you shit. A drunk guy who wanders downtown with a guitar and SS officers cap, this man is epic lulz as trying to climb a curb cause him to lash out in anger! It also has a guy with a 'violumpet'. Belfast has one thing all Irish cities don't, a distinct lack of [[chav|chavs]] in the city center. They stick to the outer shit holes and estates and dream of where the next drink is gonna come from and if your a proddy cunt or a feinianist taig. Due to the lack of chavs downtown is swamped with [[emo|emos]], and massive faggots who try to be punks, goths and [[faggot|homosexuals]]. Belfast is famous for its night life, downtown its fucking dead beside the hobos and dissdent republicans, however under the motorway underpass next to the Royal mail building is a magical place of drink, underage sex and shiny yummy pills. This area of wonder is [[New York|New York]] to the natives and is said to be exactly like the city with which it shares its name. Day time activites include, being evacuated due to bomb scares, random chav attacks, stumbling apon a [[Nazis|DUP]] or [[communist|Sinn Fein]] cross community relations rally in which they seek to make amends fo the years of stabbing and shooting each other by calling each other colourful names! If you wish to help this city get better we reconmend traveling to [[hell|East Belfast]] look for a fat, bad guy standing out side the local football supporter club, and ask if you could buy some ''nades''. Once you have picked these up head to the area known as Short Strand and deploy the ''nades'' by throwing them over the peace fence. You will become a national hero and acquire the nickname [[troll|''Stoner/Michael Stone'']].

If you really want to know what "the Troubles" and such are all about, don't be so gullible and believe that it has anything to do with religion.  That's just a red herring.  The true nature of the disagreement is that the Northern Irish lift the dishes when they piss in the kitchen sink, and those in the Irish Republic piss freely, dishes be damned.  If you want to be respected as a North American on the Emerald Isle, inform an old geezer that you know the secret, tell him, and ginger haired maidens will line up to service your every sexual need, a real live leprechaun will shit gold coins for you, and you will be forced to drink Guiness until you are dead, God rest your soul.  It will be an altogether pleasant time you'll never remember.

And thats the guide to Belfast, enjoy your rioting.

==Law==

[[Image:Hurley_and_Sliotar.JPG|thumb|right|One of these things will be used to [[Pwn|cripple]] you for life.]]

Many people think the people of Norn Iron wear <s>ski masks</s>(stop with the fucking American fail language, or I'll do yer kneecaps in) balaclavas because its [[fuck|fucking]] cold but really it's to protect their identities. If you break the law in Northern ireland, you get a summons to appear at a deserted warehouse on some godforsaken industrial estate whereupon four large men with bomber jackets and hurleys (Used in the game of Hurling) will [[mafia|relieve you of the use of your knees]].

==Multiculturalism==

There is a strange race of people in Norn Iron known as Ulster [[Scotland|Scots]]. These people insist they speak a language of the same name, but everyone knows its because they are muck savages who were raised on farms and taught English by a local drunk named Patsy McBride. These people also happen to be '''Protestants'''. This means they are stupid and seem to think that Ireland and Britain are connected in some way. Their past times include saying "no," [[wank]]ing about the Queen, calling the place Ulster and laughing at Bobby Sands. [[Image:Ian_paisley.jpg|thumb|right|Ulster Say Hello]]


The Norn Irish Tourist Board recently released a top ten list of reasons to visit the [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2245817.ece friendly], [[Lies|warm, sunny shores]] of Norn Iron, in which the residents were described as "the most bigoted people on earth". Some 44% of Northern Irish humanoids declared that they would object to gays, non-whites, muslims, jews, or people with an IQ greater than 80 moving in next door to them. This provoked shock and outrage as most people assumed that the total of bigoted hatemongers per head of population would be more like 144%. It also contrasts nicely with the 100% of Southern Irish, Welsh and English people who would like Northern Ireland to be [[afghanistan|someone else's]] neighbour. Scottish people expressed no opinion on the North because they were all too busy drinking and eating battered mars bars.

==Religion==
There is a strange race of people in Norn Iron known as Ulster Scots. These people insist they speak a language of the same name, but everyone knows its because they are muck savages who were raised on farms and taught English by a local drunk named Patsy McBride. These people also happen to be Protestants. This means they are stupid and seem to think that Ireland and Britain are connected in some way. Their past times include saying "no" and having sexual fantasies about the Queen. 

On the other end of the scale are the Catholics. Their pastimes include being [[oclet|alcoholics]] and ranting about dead guys who blew themselves up because they were trying to make explosives while [[drunk]]. Unlike the South, Norn Iron is completely devoid of all [[Hepkitten|Leprechaun]] and [[fairy]] life because the [[Nazi|IRA]] used them all for target practice and the few that were left were sodomised by Paul Berry, a DUP councillor who enjoys the company of "male sports masseurs". Catholics in Northern Ireland have a very strong connection with Padre Pio, indeed, the highest honour you can be given in Northern Ireland is to have a nail hammered through both your hands to make you just like him. 

Contrary to popular belief, this is not a violent act and anyone in Northern Ireland would be honoured to have it done. For some weird reason, Catholics along with Irish Americans seem to think Norn Iron is also somehow connected to Southern Ireland (just because it was a united country up until last thursday), even though the [[Ireland|Southern Irish]] hate everyone in NI and [[America]] and would much rather do [[buttsex|rugby]] and [[blowjob|drink beer]] with the [[Wales|Welsh]].

==Terrorism==

Northern Irelands exports include [[terrorists]]. [[retarded|full stop]]. Imports include bootleg cigarettes, weapons from as far afield as South Africa, <s>ski masks</s> balaclavas and [[Guinness]], which the Catholic population have a dependency on. A never ending convoy of trucks from Dublin feeds their drinking habits.

To many the troubles were really a second war between [[England]] and [[Ireland]]. It appears that Ireland won as it has not had to run Northern Ireland.
