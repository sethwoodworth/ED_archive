BOOBIES!!
[[Image:Jassalol.jpg|thumb|right|the icon]]
'''Boobies''' is a [[forced meme]] posted by {{Lj|user=jassa}} on pretty much every [[LJ]] feed ever.  This [[forced meme]] is a classic example of [[obsession | obsessive behavior]], and mostly leads to [[drama]], in the form of several individuals defending the meme's harmlessness, in the face of [[at least 100]] individuals wanting to know why anyone would spend time on this shit.  As in the case of [[furfags]], Boobies!! proponents are less trouble to ignore than to engage in conversation.

== Rules ==

The "Boobies!!" meme maintains a strict set of [[rules]], dictating who is allowed to post when, with what icon, and using punctuation.  These rules are kept classified, as they contain a dangerously high quantity of [[stupid]], and public knowledge of them would greatly decrease the number of [[Flame wars]] centering around [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|ur doin it wrong]].

== Origin ==

As spoken by the author (if simply inundating 400 LJ feeds with with the same random word qualifies you as an author):  

''BOOBIES!!'' in its current form originated on the old Calvin & Hobbes feed on January 25th 2005. {{Lj|user=kuh}} posted the first ''BOOBIES!!'' on a day when dozens upon dozens of people were posting 'first post[[oneoneone|!!1!]]' as a joke. I thought it was funny, so I posted it too. And then again the next day. And the day after that. It was then that I decided to continue posting it, on a daily basis, for as long as I could. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the main reason I post "BOOBIES!!". Not to get the first post. Not because I'm immature and have an obsession with breasts (or birds)."

== Current State ==

As is often the case on the [[internet]], after three years, the BOOBIES!! meme has evolved into...well, pretty much the exact same thing.  {{Lj|user=jassa}} hopes that, by continuing this meme for [[at least 100 years]], he might reach the point where someone actually cares.

== Known Gaps in the Meme == 

[[Jassa]] was so obsessed with keeping his "streak" going that when he actually left his house for a change, he contacted a fellow member of [[copypasta]]/troll group Zwesome with his user name and password in order to keep the [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|streak]] alive.  Because this user was possessed of [[fail|morals]], [[lulz]] did not ensue. So amazingly unrelenting and [[gay]] that a moderated version of the Sinfest feed, {{Ljcomm|user=sinfest_mod}} was created, with over a third of the members of the normal feed.

== Warcraft III ==
An old meme. 
*1. Open a Warcraft III game room.
*2. Start the game countdown. 
*3. After counting down to 1, be the last one who types "Boobies!"
*4. [[????]]
*5. [[Profit]]!
