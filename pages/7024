<br><br>
Robert Butler Jr. of Omaha, Nebraska was a [[typical]] [[American]] high school student who [[forever alone|just needed some friends]]. He decided to show everybody what a [[cool]] kid he was by bringing a [[gun|toy]] to school for show and tell. While educating one's schoolmates on the proper usage of firearms has become quite [[columbine|common]] these days, Robert is unique in the fact that his father is an Omaha [[pig|Police]] Detective.

=What happened=
[[File:RobButlerMurder.jpg‎|thumb|The <s>victims</s> one victim!]]
Robert originally lived with his [[concerned mother|mother]] in Lincoln, [[Nebraska]] but because she couldn't control his [[rape|impulses]], she shipped him off to Omaha to live with his [[asshole|father]]. His Father, an Omaha State Detective, proceeded to [[beat|educate]] his son in proper sideways gun control, but Robert was too distressed to pay heed.

Robert found the move distressing.He was bullied and got into fights everyday.  Winter break was a tough time for Robert, who missed school so much that he decided to hop into his car for a short visit. Upon arriving at the school's football field, Robert was gripped by an [[masturbation|intense yearning]] for [[buttsex|physical activity]], but because of his health issues, and lack of cardiovascular training, he used his automobile to take a short cut across the football field.  A few of his [[cops|father's friends]] spotted him, and [[prison|stopped him for a small chat]].

A few days later, the school's Vice Principal, Ms. Kaspar, was so impressed with Robert's [[penis|performance]] in school that she decided to extend his winter break by putting him on suspension. Robert decided to show his gratitude by putting on an educational firearms demonstration for the principal and vice-principal, the latter of which was very impressed with his accuracy. The rest of Robert's schoolmates missed out on the show [[retard|thinking that it was just some balloons popping]].
 
Afterwards, Robert decided to shoot himself to increase his hit ratio.

== How it started ==
Since he was new to the school he had no friends and he wasn't trying to [[racist|befriend]] any white kids.  However, he was noticed by some Arab and became friends with them.  Since he wanted them to think he was a cool kid and to join their cool [[terrorist|club]], after smoking his body weight in k2(fake weed) he decided to go back to school even though he was suspended.  He was being a pussy so he decided to trespass on New Years when nobody was at the school, making his act a [[fail|failure]], which made him look stupid to his friends and he still got caught by the 5-O who gave him a citation for his act.

His supension was just ninteen days, which just means his winter break turned from two weeks into a month-long vacation.  He should have enjoyed his new free time, but instead he [[rage|raged]].

=His family=

On top of all of this, it should be mentioned with great irony that his father is a police detective for the local police force so you would assume he would have taught his son a little better.  Or even that he might keep his guns in a safe, non accessible place, like a gun safe or use lock pads on the guns.  He was sent to this school due to "disciplinary problems".

Most likely meaning he was [[raping]] white women, as its in his blood.  He walked into the school [[crazy|calmly]], signed in at the [[admin]]s desk, and spent 4 minutes in a room, alone with the [[fat|vice principal]], before shooting her multiple times in the chest and running across the hall to shoot the [[admin|principle]] as well. he pulled the gun out on a few other people, but didn't have the [[balls]] to [[DO IT FAGGOT|shoot them]].

=School=

Apparently, the people in the school [[retard|thought that the gunshots, were actually balloons popping from a birthday party]]. Even though a security gaurd saw him walk out of the rooms, recognized him and even had a gun pointed at him before Robert walked out of the school.

It should be noted that he was known for skipping school.  This explains his illiterate facebook quote beating his mother, and raping local white women. Based on the  local policy of "officers will not store or leave a [[gun|firearm]] in any place within the reach or each access of a [[underageb&|minor]] or [[woman|unauthorized individual]].  It is likely his father will soon be [[welfare|unemployed]] because of the shame his son caused him.
