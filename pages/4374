John [[wtf|F.]] Kennedy is a famous video game charactor who created [[drama]] after making a cameo apperance in [[JFK Reloaded]]. Kennedy was also a former president of the United States (and king of [[bullshit|Camelot]]) who got us balls deep in [[Vietnam|Nam]], and spent his entire career trying to pawn [[communism|Fidel Castro]], before being assassinated himself by CIA Agent Alex Mason at the end of Call of Duty: Black Ops, (effectivly turning Walter Cronkite into an [[Emo]]). Even thou JFK claimed to be a decorated [[World War II]] veteren, it was later proven that he played no role in the Call of Duty: World At War game. Moar controversy was also in the works after JFK, while in Berlin, admitted that he was a jelly donut [[IRL]].

A similar [[conspiracy]] claimed the life of John's younger brother Bobby, who was killed for knowing too much about [[Anna Nicole Smith|Marilyn Monroe]]. But another, cleverer [[NSA]] black-op effort to target [[shay|Teddy Kennedy]] failed when the [[Massachusetts]] <s>senator</s> [http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/08/26/obit.ted.kennedy/index.html now rotting corpse] cunningly managed to drown the young female assassin at Chappaquiddick.

===Did You Know?===
* JFK didn't do Marilyn Monroe because she was easy, he did her because he was hard!

* The Kennedy family death curse inspired the "Final Destination" films?

* [[Asking for it|He had it coming]].

* John F. Kennedy couldn't handle the mean streets of [[Dallas]]?

* Bobby Kennedy was killed by some guy who was probably a [[Palestine|foreigner]] or at least looked like a foreigner and had a stupid repeated name (Sirhan Sirhan)?

* [[Ireland|The Irish]] cannot be trusted with authority, liquor, [[woman|females]], cars, cars with bombs in them, [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Cuba|Cuba policy]], jobs that should go to real [[Americans]] of [[W|English descent]], or [[Bill O'Reilly|television shows]]?

* If you make your vice-president a [[Texas|Texan]], he will [[Lyndon Johnson|kill you in order to get the job for himself]]?

* JFK's sister created the [[Special Olympics]], where you're still [[stupid|retard]]ed if you win, kind of like arguing on the [[Internets]]?

* A cash prize ($100,000 or was it $10,000?) was offered for the first person to successfully play a [http://www.jfkreloaded.com/ video game] in a way that matched the lone and insane gunman theory (a.k.a. single gun theory)? The makers got a cash payment from Teddy before anyone claimed the prize and then promptly pulled the game. Try to find [[JFK Reloaded|the game]], or most comments on it, and be prepared for a [[crapflood]].

*John F. Kennedy was flagged for PvP at the time he was assassinated?

=== Copypasta ===

{{squote|During that tense flight from Dallas to Washington after the assassination, Jackie inadvertently walked in on Johnson as he was standing over the casket of his predecessor and chuckling...<br/><br/>Of course, President Johnson is often given to inappropriate response—witness the puzzled timing of his smiles when he speaks of grave matters—but we must also assume that Mrs. Kennedy had been traumatized that day and her perception was likely to have been colored by the tragedy. This state of shock must have underlain an incident on Air Force One which this writer conceives to be delirium, but which Mrs. Kennedy insists she actually saw.<br/><br/>`I'm telling you this for the historical record,' she said, `so that people a hundred years from now will know what I had to go through... That man was crouching over the corpse, no longer chuckling but breathing hard and moving his body rhythmically. At first I thought he must be performing some mysterious symbolic rite he'd learned from Mexicans or Indians as a boy. And then I realized—there is only one way to say this—he was literally fucking my husband in the throat. In the bullet wound in the front of his throat. He reached a climax and dismounted. I froze. The next thing I remember, he was being sworn in as the new president.'|Jackie Onasis}}

[[TL;DR]]

==Why [[They]] Done Shot JFK==
[[Some_Argue|Some say]] that he secretly opposed the [[Vietnam War]] (although he ratcheted it up [[IRL]]), others say that he thought [[Israel]] developing a [[shitload]] of [[:Image:Nuke_Explode.jpg|nukes]] might be a little dangerous and wanted to stop them (since no-one heard this theory until [[last Thursday]] it's probably right), and yet others say it was all because he wanted to [[out]] the super-seekrit space-[[alien]]-hunters at [[Deus Ex|Project Majestic]]. There are about a dozen other theories. Who the fuck knows?
