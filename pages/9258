Yngwie is a type of [[Sweden|Swedish]] custard made from equal parts technical skill and utter [[Microsoft|lack of imagination]]. He once tried to become well known in pop music, but no one could say his name, so everyone pretended he didn't exist. However, the [[interbutts]] has made it [[copypasta|easy to spell his name]] - relegating him to a certain obscurity. It is rumored that Yngwie's parents were a result of the Lebensborn project during WW2.

As a result of Malmsteen's journey into the obscure, he has revolted against earthlings by hoarding their [[Hookers and blow|cocaine, hookers]] and occasionally taking hostages with a sawed-off double barrel shotgun[http://www.guitarsite.com/Yngwie.htm].

In the late 80s, on a flight to [[Japan]], Yngwie got drunk and started ranting about how much he hated donuts and [[fag]]s, when a [[woman]] suffered a [[Sand-filled vagina|hissy fit]] and decided to pour ice water on Yngwie (who had fallen asleep). Yngwie awoke and flew into a [[Domestic violence|rage]] where he roared at the [[bitch]] "You unleashed the fucking fury! YOU UNLEASHED THE FUCKING FURY!!!"[http://www.blabbermouth.net/yngwie_tokyo_flight.mp3], at which point he removed a guitar from the luggage rack, played an arpeggio from hell and a giant flame engulfed the woman.

Swedish news report with the audio recording of Yngwie unleashing the fucking fury:

In 2006, <s>Malmsteen died of a tragic [[Cum|cum]] overdose. His body was found [[Raep|violated]], inside a dumpster in Stockholm. Recently his bastard son, Yngwie K. Malmsteen, has filled his father shoes, recording and producing albums under his father's name, and living up to the same [[Fail|win]] that his father had.</s> <s>What the fuck? Malmsteen isn't dead you stupid sack of shit. He just released an album last year. DO YOUR RESEARCH GODDAMMIT!!</s> <s>You mad?</s> HAHAHA DISREGARD EVERYTHING SAID HERE, WE SUCK COCKS

==Youtube Drama==
Yngwie is known to throw [[PMS|hissy fits]] over the smallest things, and his recent drama with [[YouTube]] parodies of him shows it. He had one YouTuber by the name of St. Sanders banned for posting a video making fun of his shitty playing. Soon, the entire internets was outraged and the videos popped up everywhere. ED expects Yngwie to receive a large amount of [[butthurt]] for his recent [[faggotry]].

==Did you know?==
Yngwie was arrested for holding his girlfriend hostage with a shotgun. There was a video here, but Malmsteen's management [[Michael Crook|made a copyright claim]]. [[Some argue]] that the news report was [[lies|false]].

Yngwie also doesn't like donuts. Given how [[fat]] he is, this is surprising. This video was also chucked, proving that unlike most celebrities, Malmsteen behaves like a common [[blogger]] instead of learning to just ignore mean videos.

Due to the high level of fail in his albums during the [[1990s]], Yngwie has resorted to selling his Ferraris on Ebay. Most people suspect the greatest factor in his downfall is the rising price of [[Sweden|Swedish]] meatballs combined with their addictive nature.

Due to insufficient funding, his most recent album was forced to use a cover made in MS Paint.

Yngwie can play over 16 notes a second, meaning he can suck hard AND fast.
