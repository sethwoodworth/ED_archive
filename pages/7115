Rules of the Internet
__NOTOC__
There is no real set of '''Rules to the Internet''', only a standard 3 on which everyone agrees (1, 2, and 34) and some bullshit rules that came out of nowhere. There have been countless renderings of the rules, all of which have sucked balls in one way or another, the earliest originating from [[IRC]] faggotry. Nonetheless, since all [[13-year-old boys]] subconsciously crave supervision because their parents are physically and emotionally unavailable (much like converts to [[Islam]] crave direction in a [[IRL|world gone mad]] after leaving the family [[hugbox]]), '''The Rules of the Internet''' have become a virtual Internets [[Bible|Ten Commandments]] for them. 

Of course, as with all [[religion]]s, when [[bullshit|divine laws]] are left open to interpretation by [[aspies|mere mortals]], there will always be [[Anonymous Borg|fucktarded zealots]] who insist on [[Taliban|enforcing said laws]] with an [[DDoS|iron fist]].
