Rape dollars

Ever since [[Nixon]] abandoned the Bretton-Woods agreement to back the United States dollar with gold and instead decided to [[ruin|"float"]] the [[dongs|dollar]], the dollar's value has been merely the shared delusion of everyone that uses it. Initially we did this because the [[faggot|French]] and [[nazi|German]] governments mounted an attack upon the dollar, exchanging as much of it for [[jew gold|gold]] as possible knowing full well that we had [[FUBAR|deflated]] the price of gold and could not keep up with producing gold at [[over 9000|$35/oz]]. We abandoned a gold-backed currency because the United States was unwilling to accept foreign constraints upon its economic policy.

However, once again with a floated currency we have hit the same barrier. Today foreign investors hold far more in US government bonds and liquid currency than the worth of our nation's gross national product. [[jews|Foreign banks]] now get to decide the price of the dollar more than the US economy, Federal Reserve, and the legislative branch of government combined. There is a solution that's in the best interest of all Americans: the adoption of RAPE DOLLARS as the official US currency.

National Institute of Justice estimates placed the annual social cost of [[rape]] and other [[BDSM|sexual assaults]] of adults at 127 billion dollars, or about $508 per U.S. resident. That's even with rape being at a [http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/rape.htm record low as of 2003]! If we increase our national rape production we could easily put that value at upwards of several trillion dollars! Rape is an endlessly renewable resource. If we back our currency with it we can print as much money as we want without it being inflationary! RAPE DOLLARS are instant riches.

The best we can do now is educate people on the advantages of RAPE DOLLARS. In the future we can envision a world with a universal rape-backed currency, and a paradise of incredible proportions. RAPE DOLLARS will be the first step towards achieving that world.

As of 2006, the Rape Dollar is roughly equivalent to [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/VC50P2.jpg 50 British pence].
