StumbleUpYours
[http://www.stumbleupyours.com StumbleUpYours] is <s>an [[InterWeb]] [[community]] created by former [http://www.stumbleupon.com Stumbleupon] members and co-run by Squirt, a minor [[Internet_celebrity]] and [[Not-Bob]], who is still on his quest for a moderation free world</s> [[Baleeted|BALEETED!!!]]

==The purpose of Stumbleupyours==
[[Image:stumbleupyours-food.jpg|thumb|Yum. Daily dog vomit]]
A true and honest hangout for only the most disgruntled former stumblers, where Squirt (who inevitably got himself [[permabanned]] from [[Stumbleupon]]) has free reign to post daily pictures of his high cholesterol meals on styrofoam plates, and give his tired point of view on the topic of [[censorship]] and other frightfully boring subjects. You will find more of the same shitty art and bad poetry as you did on [[Stumbleupon]] but now it's only on display for this [[clique]] of [[drama queen]]s and [[attention whore]]s. If you didn't leave [[Stumbleupon]] in the midst of a [[flame war]] or dramatic blaze of glory, you won't be welcome at Stumbleupyours.

==The rules==
*On signup, you must run the gauntlet of the almighty Squirt before you are free to post. 
*You must agree to [[lurk]] [[Stumbleupon]] on a daily basis, and post as many links to the forums as possible. Extra points are earned for leading members to a controversial topic which can prove Squirts greatness, or if you become a [[sock puppet]] and start threads in his good name.
*You must state your disgust for [[Stumbleupon]] at least twice per day, pretend that you have uninstalled the toolbar and swear allegiance to Squirt, or you will be banished forever and have an entire thread dedicated to you.
*You must post pictures of your food, be it on paper, glass or styrofoam. It must resemble dog vomit or will be edited into obscurity.
*You must always agree with Squirt. Give him sympathy and support and always laugh at him behind his back.
