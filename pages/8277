The Nightmare Before Christmas
{{Spoiler|Jack Skellington steals Christmas, is shot down by the army, and [[WTF|Oogie Boogie is made of bugs]] and dies!!1!|/spoiler}}

[[gay|The Nightmare Before Christmas]] is a bulimic, gay pride film for social rejects to fap to, created by [[necrophiliac]], [[faggot|Tim Burton]] in an attempt to make corpse fuckers feel cool (because [[srsly]], the only people who won't run from them screaming will already be [[dead]]). Despite the lack of commercial success, it has a [[cult]] following amongst [[goths]] and [[emos]], who often spend ridiculous amounts of money on merchandise from the film at their local [[Hot Topic]], sacrificing their weekly allowance as homage to their mopey and ungroomed god, Tim Burton.

=Characters=

(The ones worth noting, anyways)

<b>Jack Skellinton</b> - an incredibly jaded [[emo|skeleton]] who is about as tall as a house and as thin as your anorexic little sister. Is deluded into thinking the King of Halloween can deliver severed heads as Christmas presents (maybe secretly for the [[lulz]]?). Is stalked by a [[fat]], undead [[ginger]]. God help him.

<b>Sally</b> - a creation and property of the town scientist, Jew. Sally is madly in love with Jack so the logical thing she does is stalk him. But to her despair, Jack has no interest in her whatsoever in the entire movie, which is, of course, due to the fact that she is (like most emo girls), downright ugly and quite a fatty. 

<b>Dr Finklestein</b> - a crazy scientist that has an obsession with creating dead women. Also, a Jew. [[No|Surprised?]]

<b>Lock, Shock, and Barrel</b> - A trio consisting of two [[shota]]s and one [[loli]], they kidnap Santa...and that's about it.

<b>Oogie Boogie</b> - Argumentatively a wannabe [[KKK|klansman]] yet also a sentient black person (indicated by his [[pimp|ape voice]], dice addiciton, and [[pedophile|child prostituition]]) potatosack . [[WTF|Made of bugs]]. According to [[IdeaWiki]] he killed [[Jett Travolta]].

<b>Santa Claus</b> - a [[fat]] [[pedophile]] twat who gets kidnapped by children and used to make [[pr0n]]. Incredibly unimportant to the story considering his fap-status to the spawn of [[cracker|white christians]].

=Teh Plot=

[[Image:Nightmare-Before-Christmas6.png|frame|right|That fucking skeleton!]]

A couple of cringy numbers from the undead, and the scene is set: main character Jack Skellington is tired [[shit brix|scaring the shit]] out of people for the [[lulz]]. 

Going for an [[BAWWW|emo sobbing session]], Jack gets lost in the woods and finds a <s>[[Pedobear|small child]]</s> set of doors leading to holiday-themed worlds.

Meanwhile, Jack is stalked by Sally the [[transvestite|ragdoll]], who wants to bone him. Instead of telling him and risk infecting him with her [[ginger]], she instead hides behind a grave [[emo|slashing her wrists]].

Jack opens a tree-shaped door that leads him to a [[Michael Jackson|magical faggoty wonderland]], filled with [[cocaine|snow]] and [[Midget|elves]]. Following yet another [[gay|musical number]], Jack decides to [[steal|claim]] Christmas as his own holiday and brings back several [[semen|Christmas-related items]] back with him, to show his [[vagina|friends]] and bring forth his [[concentration camp|plans]] to take over some holiday once harbored by [[christfag|Jesus freaks]], for Epic [[Lulz]]. Some think Jack is really just a massive [[troll]]. 

During the process of taking over Christmas, Jack hires the help of [[whore|Lock, Shock, and Barrel, Oogie Boogie's sexslaves]]. Their mission is to [[rape|kidnap]] Santa and stop him from [[raping|giving presents to]] [[13 year old boys]]. Taking the [[fat]] bastard back to Halloween Town, Jack may [[Holocaust|carry out his master plan]]. As it turns out, the kids take Santa to Oogie Boogie's, a rejected Klansman with a [[niggers|gambling problem]] where he plans to have [[kinky|awkward banjo sex]] sessions with Santa.

Finally, Jack goes on to play the role of an [[anorexic]], [[emo]] Santa by delivering [[buttsecks|presents]] to children around the world. Despite the fact that Jack has been the king of Halloween for [[Over_9000|hundreds]] of years and has no concrete idea of what could pass as a [[AIDS|good present for kids these days]], he delivers presents including a [[Guro|severed head]] and possessed toys which would only be considered decent in [[Alabama]] or in Jeffery Dahmer's house. During this time, Sally attempts to save Santa, only to be [[FAIL|captured]] by Oogie and kept as his [[whore]] and, more importantly, [[women|maintain his kitchen]]. After [[shitstorm|numerous alarming calls]], the army intervenes and eventually [[pwnt|blows the FUCK out of Jack's emo-mobile]]. This validates that [[FAIL|Jack is a failure]] when it comes to Christmas, ensuring plentiful [[lulz]] for all until he starts being [[emo]] and sings again. 

After he gets off his [[emo]] ass, Jack goes back to Halloween Town and saves Santa. He [[fucks]] Sally (saying "fuck it" and not feeling concerned of [[AIDS]] on account of being only bones) as Santa goes off to give [[rape|presents]] to all the good little [[shota|boys]] and [[loli|girls]]. [[j/k|Everything's fine]] and once more, the [[emos]] and [[goths]] of the world are [[semen|creaming]] themselves over a [[gay|ridiculous]] film.

=New Faggotry vs. Old=

[[Last Thursday]], Disney decided the [[drugs|coke]] pile was running low and that the [[emos]] and [[goths]] could do with new [[fap|wank]] material. By new I of course mean release the same old [[shit|shitty film]] with [[emo|wrist-slitting]] scene music replacing the old tunes. Long-time faggots such as [[Fall Out Boy]], Marilyn Manson, and [[Panic! at the Disco]] all whined and shrieked down a microphone for several hours to produce the new sountrack, causing fangirls and fanboys to orgasm and [[shit]] their pants while watching the movie. All at the same time.

===What do the Old fags of the Fandom Think?===

[[image:Sally_cosplayer.jpg|thumb|Don't make eye contact...]]

While the scene kids of today want to drug the remake and sleep with it, the goths of yesteryear cry big black tears at the supposed [[rape]] of their favorite film. They liked it before it was cool to like it! [[truth|Except, it was never cool.]] They're particularly [[butthurt]] over the change in music, [[gay|licking the balls]] of their second god, [[faggot|Danny Elfman]]. Then again, it's Fall Out Boy. Who could blame them?

The emos remain in the middleground being pussies.

===Is it Worth it?===

No.
