Nicholas Morency
Nicholas "The Nixtr" Morency was a longtime [[Transformers]] fan, known for a series of [[unfunny|waaaaacky]] parody [[fanfic]]s and his hard right-wing political point of view.
Nixtr had a long and questionable track record on [[USENET]], including [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/3958f5e7f43138aa?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&c2coff=1 an online proposal to his girlfriend].  Incomprehensibly, she said yes.

More interestingly, Morency was arrested in early 1999 for offering 1.5 million dollars to anyone who would [[murder]] an [[abortion]] doctor for him.  When the [[FBI]] seized his computer, they also discovered disks containing thousands of images of [[kiddie porn]].

==The Drama Unfolds==
When a [[wiigii]]er [http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl686588447d&dq=&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&c2coff=1&selm=98h4gc%24pql%241%40news.igs.net posted the news of Morency's initial arrest] to USENET's alt.toys.transformers, the resulting explosion of drama and comedy probably peaked when [[Zobovor]] argued that [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/292a18aaae2dcf3b?dmode=source&hl=en possessing pictures of children being raped doesn't necessarily mean that you SUPPORT children being raped], [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/a46ae71435f35daf?dmode=source owning a copy of ''Lethal Weapon'' is tantamount to actually comitting murder], and that [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/11ea66d5749e089c?hl=en offering a bounty for the murder of another human being wasn't as bad as idly threatening to kill someone because you hated a TV show they wrote].  (Note: The latter ''is'' considerably gayer than the former, however.)

==The Resolution==
Morency was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, and cried like a total [[pu55y]] in court.  He also reportedly, upon being told that his kiddy porn was being confiscated, asked if he could still look at regular [[porn]].  However, at no point did Morency *ever* express any regret for trying to hire an assassin.  Morency was released [[last Thursday]].  As a part of his settlement, Morency is not allowed to own a computer, access the [[internets]], or play with toy robots ever again.
