'''Notepad''' is the name of the free word processor that comes with [[Windows]]. Like all things [[Microsoft]], it is complete and utter [[shit]] and should be avoided like the [[Swine flu|plague]]

==Limitations==

Notepad is so ''goddamn [[fuck]]ing fantastic!'' It has advanced functions like saving, loading, help topics (lol, srsly), and most importantly, '''quitting''' (which is the only useful feature). It also has a lulzy function called Time/Date in any case you would be too lazy to look at the bottom-right corner of your screen. Other groundbreaking features include one font at a time, no OLE, no formatting, no [[spell check]], and a serious lack of [[pr0n]]. All of this adds up to lulz on Microsoft.

==Advantages==
The advantages of Notepad are limited to two things. First it takes up so [[midget|little]] RAM that you could run it on [[your mom]]'s computer, which means you can keep it open alongside [[MSN]], [[Photoshop]], [[Half Life 2]] and the [[apocalypse]]. Although Notepad doesn't have them fancy features like them city folks' word processors, it does have replace (Ctrl-H) which is useful for mindless [[sex|repetitive tasks]] such as converting all the moves in [[list of sex moves]] to headings or dot points from whatever it currently is, or changing all links to your [[e-nemy]]'s user page on a talk page to link to [[asshole]].

==The Code==
The code for Notepad can be likened to injecting yourself with liquid [[shit]] - it is messy, disgusting and will ''sure as hell [[kill]] you.''

== Conspiracy ==

If one opens Notepad, which isn't too hard to do, and types in "Bush hid the facts" (w/out the quotes}, saves it (doesn't matter what the document name is), closes the program, and opens the document again, the sentence you typed will be gone. Depending on what version you have, it will either show as <strike>boxes</strike> " 畂桳栠摩琠敨映捡獴 " with <strike>[[Japanese]]</strike> [[Chinese]] characters installed (which roughly translates to [http://translate.google.com/?hl=en#zh-CN|en|%E7%95%82%E6%A1%B3%E6%A0%A0%E6%91%A9%E7%90%A0%E6%95%A8%E6%98%A0%E6%8D%A1%E7%8D%B4 Liubenrenmo Tiantouyingjian Mongoose]) or nothing at all. SO DOES THIS MEAN THAT HE [[9/11|HID THE FACTS?]]

== Notepad Fevotees ==

The only people who use notepad are those who either:

# Don't have the [[money]] to buy [[Word]];
# Are too stupid to [[pirate]] Word; or
# Haven't figured out that [[Windows]] is bundled with a less shitty word processor, Word Pad.
# People who realize that Notepad is a text editor not a word processor and would rather not have a red squiggly line appear every time they type [[Programming|<code>cout << "stfu noob";</code>]].
# People who like to actually have their code compile when they don't have an IDE available. (Just try compiling code written in MS [[Word]].)
# People who don't have enough [[tubes]] to download Notepad++.
