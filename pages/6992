'''Rick "Dirty" Sanchez''' was a [[CNN]] 'newsman' who is best known for getting [http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-november-8-2005/moment-of-zen---sanchez-taser Tased] so he could get a real gig at CNN. In [[2010]] he graduated from being a reporter in the field doing stupid shit like jumping into the middle of hurricanes to getting his own show called '''Rick's List''' where all he did was [[tweet]], read [[twitter]] posts and rip-off [[Keith Olbermann]]'s list of ''"The Worst Person In The World"'' with his own segment called [[Death List|''"The List You Don't Want To Be On"'']]. 

In October, 2010, Mr. Sanchez was [[fired|shitcanned]] and [http://ricksanchez.blogs.cnn.com/ removed from the Internets] by the [[jews|Sanhedrin]] after going on [[Sirius]] and calling [[Jon Stewart]] a bigot and saying that [[fact|Jews control the media]]. This after being [[butthurt]] over Mr. Stewart's constant [[trolling|snipes]] at the self-procaimed '''King of Twitter'''.

==Early Life==

Rick Sanchez was born on a [[Cuban]] banana plantation in 1958. When he was young, [[Fidel Castro]] chucked a rock at his head while he was climbing a tree for bunch of [[Cocks|bananas]], causing Rick to fall and [[Terri Schiavo|sustain permanent brain damage]]. He also worked as a truck driver briefly as a cover to smuggle illegal Cuban immigrants into America. His first trip was cut tragically short when he drove off a pier in Havana and his truck sunk to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. Unfortunately, he survived the event and was eventually deported to raise the collective IQ of his [[cuba|native country]].

When his family came to America, Rick was forced to learn [[English]] by reading [[txt msg|text messages]] off of the phones of wealthy [[Florida|Floridians]] that he had stolen, which is why a vast majority of his show consisted of repeating [[twatter]] messages he had received in a voice similar to that of [[Rush Limbaugh|a stroke victim on painkillers]].

In the [[1990s| 1990's]] Sanchez landed a gig on WSVN Channel 7 ([[Faux]]) in [[Miami]]. He was the first in a long line of orange skinned [[Oompa-Loompa| oompa-loompa]] reporters on WSVN. He was paid in rice, beans, and cigars.

==Working at [[CNN]]==

Rick Sanchez is the dictionary definition of [[trying too hard]]. His rise at CNN began when he helped [[Rupert Murdoch|Larry King]] understand what a computer is while changing one of the elder host's diapers. Larry was so impressed with Rick's knowledge of technologies that he made sure Ted Turner gave him an important place at the company. Ever since, Americans have wondered how somebody far stupider than they are can be qualified to tell them what is going on in the world. Leading the charge to make fun of this twat was [[Jon Stewart]], who had run out of retarded people to make fun of since [[George W. Bush]] left office. [http://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/The-Jon-Stewart-Jokes-That-Drove-Rick-Sanchez-Overboard-5246 Here is a small sampling of the many times Jon Stewart made fun of Rick Sanchez over the years.] He also wrote a book (entitled ''[[Irony|Conventional Idiocy]]: [[JEWS DID WTC|Why the New America Is Sick of Old Politics]]'') that sold a grand total of [[Fail|802 copies in its opening week]].

==[[USI|The King of Twitter]]==
Being such a [[USI|self-styled expert]] in all things [[social media]], Mr. Sanchez was asked (or begged) to be the host of the first annual ''"[[short bus|Shorty Awards]]"'' (the Oscars for [[twitter]] users) in [[2009]]. This reporter can think of nothing else to write beyond the preceding sentence. It's just that...it [[hur dur|speaks volumes about Rick Sanchez, twitter and all things social media]]. Here's the interview he gave CNN International about the whole shebangabang. He sounds like he was jerking himself off under the desk.

Rick was also forced to defend CNN's use of [[twitter]] after getting ridiculed by Jon Stewart.

==Not Working at CNN==

Rick finally got fed up with [[Jon Stewart]] calling him an assclown on an almost daily basis and unloaded on him on a [[Shit nobody cares about|radio talk show]]. He also took this opportunity to point out that both Stewart and Sanchez's bosses are a bunch of [[Truth|greedy liberal Jews]], costing himself his job in the progress:

{{quote|[[old meme|One of my best friends is Jewish!]]|Sanchez}}

In retrospect, calling [[Fred Phelps|Ted Turner]] a member of the ZOG Machine might not have been a great move. He can now enjoy standing in the unemployment line while some [[Mexican]] takes his job.

It should be noted how much delicious [[irony]] there is in the fact that somebody who portrays himself as so media savvy - and especially [[1337|NEW media savvy]]- would run his mouth on satellite radio like nobody was ever going to hear it and then [[tweet]] it all over the globe.

It should also be noted that before Mr. Sanchez's parents were forced to flee from [[Cuba]] in the '60s with only the clothes on their wet backs, that they were rich, elitist <s>light-skinned</s> white (damn Jews) Cubans who thrived under the U.S. backed Cuban dictator '''Fulgencio Batista''''s fascist regime at the expense of the minority <s>dark-skinned</s> black (fucking kikes) Cubans until Fidel Castro and [[Che]] booted their lilly white [[British|arses]] out of Havana.

===Jon Stewart Responds===

During [[Comedy Central]]'s ''Night Of Too Many Stars'' benefit for [[autism]] the following evening, Mr. Stewart was quick to twist the knife in Ol' Dirty Sanchez's back.

{{quote|Giving money is a great was to assuage a guilty conscience. If you work on Wall Street for example. But if you went on radio and said the Jews control the media...you may want to hold on to your money. But if he's right about the Jews, all he has to do is apologize to us, and we'll hire him back.|[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i5a116168a138e4eed6c378d6b9cedfd6 Jon Stewart]}}

===Rick Sanchez Apologizes...===
[[File:RICKSANCHEZ_wife.jpg|center|thumb|500px|...through his wife.]]
According to Mr. Dirty Sanchez's wife's Failbook status update, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/05/rick-sanchez-jon-stewart-apology_n_750656.html he has spoken to John Stewart and apologized]. Jon Stewart called him [[thin skin]]ned and couldn't help [http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-october-4-2010/hurty-sanchez running a victory lap around the vanquished Sanchez] on his Monday show following the shitstorm, comparing him to Steve Carell's character in '''''The Office'''''.

Meanwhile, [[Christopher Hitchens]] has thrown his 2Â¢ into the ring saying that Sanchez is 100% correct about Jews [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/04/christopher-hitchens-rein_n_750015.html and should be reinstated].

{{quote|The best way to demonstrate the hidden influence of [[jews|the chosen people]] would be for Jon Stewart and others to join me in calling for Rick Sanchez's reinstatement. If it then didn't happen, it would help us understand [[jews|who really pulls the strings around here]].|Hitchens}}

[[Some argue|It has been rumored]] that CNN repeatedly tried to kill off Rick Sanchez in the hopes that they could replace him with a [[Unrealistic expectations|normal, human being capable of actually reporting the news]]. Some of these attempts are documented above, but other cases exist that aren't as well documented on the [[interwebs]]. Examples include leaving Rick alone on top of a mountain like a member of a [[OM NOM NOM NOM|Uruguayan rugby team]], and leaving Rick alone in a life raft in the middle of the ocean. CNN was running [[Pool's Closed|polls]] to determine what [[An hero|stupid stunt Rick would attempt next]], only to have their problem solved by the evil leftard media. [[Moonspeak|Telemundo]] is currently considering letting Rick [[Yiff|taunt angry bulls]] as part of their sweeps week this coming season.

==Miscellany==

===[[Irony|Rick Sanchez vs. Lou Dobbs]]===
Prior to getting his own show and [[Craigslist|Rick's List]], back in [[2007]] Rick Sanchez got into it with CNN's token <s>blowhard [[bigot]]</s> American hero Lou Dobbs, a tireless crusader against '''[[ALL CAPS|ILLEGAL]]''' Beaners (<s>despite being married to one</s> get it right [[leftards]]). Every night, good ol' Lou would go on and on and on (and on) about how the waves of <s>Latino immigrants</s> illegal Mexican aliens swarming to America from south of the border would be the death of [[the Great Satan]]. Finally, some programming genius figured out that throwing a former illegal immigrant into the lions den to be [[flamed|savagely mauled]] by King Lou would be great TV. Naturally, dumbass Rick played the [[victim complex]] card and went mano-a-mano with Mr. Dobbs about how he feels devalued by Lou and his [[racists|ilk]] and [[irony|pled for tolerance]] and civil discourse when it comes to nonexistant minorities along with [[bawww]]ing about how his hard put-upon illegal parents (Paco and Adella) had to service [[The Man]] working multiple jobs whilst [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER|neglecting to learn English]] to give young Ricardo a shot at getting fired for his English language skills.

===[[OJ Simpson|Rick Sanchez]] vs. Pedestrians===
[[File:Rick_sanchez_comment.png|thumb|250px|LOL comments]]
Rick Sanchez is a major fan of American [[Handegg]] and never gets tired of telling everyone on TV about how fond he is of the [[NFL]]. Never. He used to spend about as much time talking about [[Handegg]] as he did about [[SFB|the '''real''' news]]. This explains a lot since extreme [[Handegg]] fanbois are complete morons. Mr. Sanchez and his love of man-on-man violence became such a running joke on CNN that even when Jon Stewart made fun of Sanchez's obsession it was already [[old meme]] at CNN. The moral of this story is [[DON'T MESS WITH FOOTBALL]]!!!

Rick Sanchez likes Handegg so much that he once killed someone over it. On December 10, 1990, Sanchez [http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1991-08-07/news/the-forgotten-man/ ran over a pedestrian with his car and left the scene]. His victim was paralyzed and eventually died in a hospital on November 2, 1995. Mr. Sanchez had just left a game between his hometown Miami Dolphins and the Philadelphia Eagles when he pwned the dude. Breathalyzer test results determined that Dirty Sanchezâs blood alcohol level was 4 times above the legal limit. Somehow, this repressed minority figure skated on all the charges except for pleading no contest for DUI.

===Rick Sanchez and [[Furries]]===
In 1997 while working at [[FOX News|WSVN-TV]] in Miami, Rick Sanchez was forced into teasing and introducing a story about furries.
