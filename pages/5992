Omnetscient
'''Omnetscience''' is the power possessed by someone that ''always'' knows what other users mean, irrespective of what they actually say or how unclearly they say it.

These people, like all [[psychic]]s, are highly prone to [[drama]].  They can often be found on [[LiveJournal]] advertising their talents to anybody that makes mention of online confusion or disagreement.

Their belief in their own [[skillz]] makes them unusually easy targets for [[troll]]ing, so much so that there's really no point in bothering.  However, it is not uncommon for them to ''pre-emptively'' get trolled by casual passers-by. In these situations, the unwitting troll may be incited into more trollish behaviour, which could be the beginning of a [[Jameth|promising career]], or they may just respond in kind, which is the sort of witless [[crap]] you should expect from someone that hangs around omnetscients.

Omnetscient people also tend to be [[Grammar Nazi]]s and [[feminist]]s.  They're invariably young, immature [[16 year old girls|female]]s who describe themselves as "old souls."

Some of them are [[Bureaucratic fucks|admins]] on [[TOW]] and block people for rudeness when they've been perfectly polite, because they know that said people mean to be rude.

==Examples==
* [[Tawneelynne]], who alone among [[LJ]] users knows that everyone who trolls her is going to [[rape]] her.
* [[Girlmecha]], who knows better than [[bisexuals]] and says they are all [[poser]]s.
* Most of [[Wikipedia Admin Gallery|these guys]].
