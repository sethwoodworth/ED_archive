Crazy Bus
[[Image:Crazybustitle.png|thumb|right|The god awful Intro]]

With the technological advancements in [[Scientology|SCIENCE]], we have be lucky enough to be given electricity, television and the [[internet|series of small tubes]] you sit on every day of your dreadful and empty existence. Then we were given a little electronic box to play the [[vidya]] all day on, then that all changed.

'''Crazy Bus''' is the pointless and god awful game made in 2004. It basically consists of just an intro title and [[Fail|no game play whatsoever.]]

Do you like having your ear raped? 

Well look no further.

Feel like singing along? 
<br><br>Crazy bus, crazy bus, Riding on the crazy bus
<br>Riding up, riding down, Driven by a funny clown, 
<br>Wacky, goony, goofy, spoony, [[drugs|High]] as a plane or a balloon-y
<br>Crazy bus, come ride with us, As we ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
<br>It's a crazy bus, but not a schmazy bus, Don't make a fuss, just come with us,
<br>Slappy, sloopy, gloppy, gloopy, Happy-happy, hoopy-hoopy,
<br>Dopey, doffy, screwy, blue-y, Gooey, chewy, fooey, dewey, Absolutely bus-a-looey, 
<br>Crazy, lazy, crazy, crazy bus, A flat tire is no problem, Because it's only flat on the bottom, 
<br>A flat tire is no problem, Because it's only flat on the bottom, So let's go! Let's go! Let's GO!
<br>Wacky, goony, goofy, spoony, High as a plane or a balloon-y
<br>Crazy bus, come ride with us, As we ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
<br>It's a crazy bus, but not a schmazy bus, Don't make a fuss, just come with us

<br> Possibly <i>the</i> gayest song ever made.
