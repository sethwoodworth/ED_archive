John Cooper II

'''John Cooper, II''' is an obscure "screenwriter", author, and mental institution escapee from Morehead, [[Kentucky]] or as he prefers to call himself "[[Internet celebrity|A Real American]]", and his limited e-fame is mostly due to his prominent consumption of [[Vore|vore]] porn rather than his M*A*S*H fan-fiction GRAND RAPIDS O'REILLYS, which he published on the M*A*S*H fan site "Best Care Anywhere" and no where else.  A legend in his own lunch break, he capitalizes each and every every proper noun, and peppers his shit with words [[Noone|no one]] has ever used like "Groovy", "Y'all" and "Old Chap". It has been suggested he [[Katrina|suffers]] from [[schizophrenia]], [[multiple personality disorder]] -- on account of his posting comments under both John Cooper II and Tom "Mac" McMillan -- , or [[Asperger's Syndrome|tourette's syndrome]]. He probably was also fed [[LSD]] when he was four and was a member of the Vienna Boys Chior. He thinks [[Lindsay Lohan|Janis Joplin]] is the "Queen of [[Heavy metal|Heavy-Metal-Punk]]", that Johnny Winter is not an albino, but a session musician for Tholonius Monk and he enjoys posing as the cilents of [http://www.bondstars.com Bondstars], including most of the [[shemale|female ones]] and George Lazenby. Cooper says Bob Denver hated [[Glitter's Cap-Page Board|www.glitterrock.org]] and all the Bondstars found the captions based on their movies, dull. He thinks [[Republicans]] are the source of all evil in the world and plans to feature them in his movies as [[ghetto]] gangsters despite the fact that George Wallace and Lyndon Johnson were both Democrats. He believes [[John McCain]] is a commie, and hates [[Barack Obama]] and fears he will ban booze and pork, which along with SweetTarts and Tab cola, make up the staple of his diet, like [[redneck|most people]] in Eastern Kentucky.  His heroes include Archie Bunker, due to the fact he believes TV characters are real, he also thinks French philospher, Jean-Paul Sartre never existed.

The same pattern can be found in his postings on message boards and forums, much to the continued horror and [[Mark Foley|embarrassment]] of other [[Cyndre|visitors.]] On many occasions, individuals have suggested simple improvements he might make in his writing, but his imperviousness to common sense knows no bounds, or as he states, because he wants to [[Lie|"stick to his ethics".]]

==The Future of Cinema==

He intends on making a [[Lens flare|movie]] based on his fan [[Palestine|fiction]] called RADAR O'REILLY COUNTY SHERIFF which will star [[Lindsay Lohan]] and a [[At least 100|horrendous]] number of over-the-hill and/or dead TV actors -- [[Unwarranted self-importance|all of whom Cooper claims to know]] and have told him the script is "Really Groovy!" The details of his plan are truly [[tl;dr]], but they apparently involve a nurse, a sheriff, and Grand Rapids, Minnesota. He plans to include "REAL HISTORICAL FACTS AND EVENTS" which he knows nothing about and his resource is a book on the history of police cars.


One of his chief activies appears to be leaving [[batshit|unreadable screeds]] on the guest pages of various actors and actresses. [[tl;dr|Full text]] of two of them, left on washed-up British actor [http://www.patrickmacnee.com/work/work.html Patrick Macnee's] [http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:_LPLSgLW7vIJ:www.patrickmacnee.com/data/guestbook1e.html+mayberryradio%40yahoo.com&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=2 guestbook] below:

''Script for "SONS OF THE AVENGERS" has added my good friend TERRY COLDIRON (currently employed by the public school system) in BULLITT COUNTY, KENTUCKY to the casting list for the role of JOHN STEED, JR. with TERRY'S brother LARRY as HORATIO STEED, & their cousin JAMIE as ALBERT STEED. Also, upon reviewing the script SIR ROGER MOORE had tears coming to his eyes when he learned that I included his characters of SIMON TEMPLAR from "THE SAINT" (quite a popular show when "THE AVENGERS" were on the air) as well as LORD BRETT SINCLAIR from "THE PERSAUDERS", he did after both "THE SAINT" & "THE AVENGERS" were cancelled. TONY CURTIS (SIR ROGER'S co-star from "THE PERSAUDERS") is happy as a lark knowing he gets to reclaim his role of DANNY WILDE from that series. Now while certain associates of mine are currently settling plans for LINDA THORSON'S salary for the film, I've got other associates negociating with DIANA RIGG for a cameo appearance as MRS. EMMA PEEL, & HONOR BLACKMAN for a cameo as DR. CATHY GALE. Meanwhile, former BOND girls EUNICE GAYSON & ZENA MARSHALL have given thought & agreed to portray the roles of LADY BRENDA SINCLAIR (to be portrayed by MARSHALL) & BEATRICE WILDE (to be portrayed by GAYSON). KEN ADAM (the production designer of 1962'S "DR. NO") is helping to scout out locations in GEORGIA (close to the towns of COVINGTON & CONYERS) where the first five episodes of the 1ST season of "THE DUKES OF HAZZARD" were filmed at as well as most episodes of the series "IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT" as based on the 1967 academy-award winning nominee for both BEST PICTURE & BEST ACTOR for the late ROD STEIGER. Ofcourse, KEN ADAM has given his full-scale approval for some filming in the town of SPARTA, ILLINOIS, where the theatrical film version of "IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT" was filmed in the 1960'S. Scenes taking place in areas such as ORLY COUNTY, GEORGIA; BISHOP COUNTY, GEORGIA; WINSLOW COUNTY, GEORGIA; OSAGE COUNTY, GEORGIA; CHICKASAW COUNTY, GEORGIA; PLACID COUNTY, GEORGIA; CHOCTAW COUNTY,GEORGIA; MAYBERRY, N. CAROLINA; & MT. PILOT, N. CAROLINA, will be filmed in MENIFEE, ROWAN, BATH, CARTER, BOYD, MONTGOMERY, ELLIOT, MORGAN, LEWIS, FLEMING, & MASON COUNTIES in KENTUCKY. The main reason is that all of those backroads going through the dangerous twists & turns & such in the foothills of the APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS would look great film, especially with closeup shots of the cast members & the vehicles their characters are to drive in the film, meaning the cameras will be mounted onto FORMULA-1 racing cars from circa1966 when the late JOHN FRANKENHEIMER filmed the race car epic "GRAND PRIX" as well as the cameras in the beds of a series of 1967-72 FORD pickup trucks of the F-100, F-150, F-250, & F-350 types transport additional cameras that'll also be filming the car chase scenes as well as aerial photographer DONNY RIDDLE whom although he's an AMERICAN, well, he sees himself as another JOHNNY JORDAN whom handled aerial photography for the films "YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE", "CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG", "ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE" & "CATCH-22". It was during filming on "CATCH-22" when JORDAN fell out of his special harness and died. Ofcourse, now through the use of special parachutes concealed under clothing nowadays as introduced to us by aerial stuntman B./J. WORTH whom has worked on numerous BOND films from "THE SPY WHO LOVED ME" to "LICENSE TO KILL" thinks that the idea of will work, & if such an idea was used when JOHNNY JORDAN was alive, well, he'd still be here today. More details later. Bye''</blockquote>

''Filming on theatrical motion picture entitled "SONS OF THE AVENGERS" to be delayed for the time being. However, pre-production is in the works for PATRICK'S portrayal of a man with an ill wife & a batchelor son possibly in his late 30'S. ROGER MOORE, PATRICK'S co-star from 1985'S "A VIEW TO A KILL" will portray the son whose name is DALE LEVIN. The book on which this other film is based is entitled "LOVING PROMISES", & was written by GAIL GAYMER MARTIN. Her official website is www.gailmartin.com, & she may be able to answer certain questions if any!? Also, this film will feature appearances by STEPHANIE BEACHAM, KRISTINA WAYBORN, CAROLE BOUQUET, CAROLINE MUNRO, KEN ADAM, & RICHARD DREYFUSS just to name a few castiing possibilities! Cameo appearances shall include GREG EVIGAN unloading his truck from his classic AMERICAN tv series "B./J. & THE BEAR". Further updates to be delivered later. Bye.'' </blockquote>
Macnee shut down his guestbook after this. Cooper has settled down with a mail order bride and has not been seen or heard from since July of 2007.
==He returns==
On May 29th, 2008 he returned to the BCA boards to continue posting shit, he said future US President [[Hilary Clinton]] endorsed his story, than disappeared. Around the start of 2009, he returned again, and filled every thread in the "Fan Fiction" section of the BCA with his shit.
