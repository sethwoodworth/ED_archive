'''Daily Kos''' is [[blog]] where [[liberal|pinko]] [[retard]] [[basement dwellers]] highlight the [[moar]] [[insane|deluded]] of the [[leftard]] section of the [[tinfoil hats|tinfoil hat]] crowd's [[conspiracy]] theories about [[George W. Bush]], [[conservative]]s, and the state of the [[United States|nation]].  Articles on this shrill blog repeat how Bush stole the election ''ad infinitum'', that Dick Cheney is a [[robot]] when he is actually just an ''eminence gris'', and [[BDSM|fantasize]] about [[Ann Coulter]] being a man. This last claim is particularly cruel in view of the Daily Kos viewpoint that [[shemale]]s should always be identified as women. 

The Daily Kos is a prime example of why we should be [[Genocide|warming up the ovens]] for most bloggers.

'''Protip:''' 90 percent of the groundbreaking news on Kos is bullshit. Posting it on any intelligent [[forum]] will make you look like a [[retard]].

==A History==

Daily Kos was founded by a [[beaner]] and closet [[homosexual]] named '''Markos "Kos" Moulitsas Zuniga''' in [[2002]] after spending the previous six months <s>"interviewing for a job" with</s> being trained by the CIA.  Created to "[http://www.dailykos.com/special/about#link fight the right in the blogger wars]," it has become a [[e-popular|popular]] clearing house for [[liberal|pinko]] [[news]] and [[propaganda]].   Like its sister site, [[Wikipedia]], posters don't care about [[fact]]s, but see the site as a vehicle for truth-free propaganda, and treat their own wild-eyed theories as [[common knowledge]]. Some also believe that Markos, being born on [[Owned|September 11]], 1971, is the main-brain jew behind [[Jews did WTC|WTC]].

==Kos the paid consultant==

In 2004, during the Democratic Party presidential primaries, Markos was a '''paid consultant''' for the [[Howard Dean]] campaign.  You see, Kos is close friends with Joe Trippi, Dean's former campaign manager.  He hardly told anyone about his being on the Dean campaign's payroll, and only disclosed their relationship after being pressured by media watchdogs.  He finally posted a [http://www.dailykos.net/archives/002972.html really super pissy disclosure] for the duration of his time as a Dean consultant.  To this day, he hates anyone bringing up his consultant work, and [http://www.dailykos.com/special/about dodges the question] about it.

Joe Trippi, Howard Dean's former campaign manager, is now the campaign manager for [[John Edwards]]' 2008 presidential run.  The fact that Kos has been shilling for John Edwards since the beginning of 2007 is surely an unrelated coincidence.

==Drama==

* The site has a very interesting policy on [[comments]], barring new users from commenting on the first day they sign up.  That is because they are [[fascist]] and fear dissenting thought.

* They constantly have blog wars with [[Little Green Footballs]] in an attempt to see who can penetrate the other's tinfoil most deeply.

* If [[you]] offer a dissenting opinion, the moderators constantly ask for "proof" that your opinion is right, even if you've already given it. If you continue to give dissenting opinions, you will be labeled a [[troll]] and have your posting "privileges" revoked.

==User Diaries==

Because founder Markos Moulitas is a paid CIA disinformation agent charged with discrediting the liberal movement and is thus usually too busy cashing his CIA checks to provide adequate material for the blog, Daily Kos is now driven largely by user diaries. These generally fall under one of the following general headings:

* "My brother's friend lost his job FUCK YOU GEORGE BUSH *UPDATE* My brother's friend is still unemployed after two years FUCK YOU GEORGE BUSH!

* "FUCK YOU GEORGE BUSH w/poll"[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Kos.jpg#file]

* "I have an opinion about Israel. Does anyone else have an opinion about Israel? If so, we should argue about Israel on my user diary."

* "HAI GUYZ I'M JOHN EDWARDS, WHATZ GOING ON IN THIS BLOG?!?111111!?1"

* "Let's pretend like we rightfully despise Christianity."

* "Hey, somebody just sayed something we disagree with, the [[GOP]] must be planting shills!"

* "That idea is totally unrealistic and would never work in the real world, good job, we all agree."

* "Fuck the war, and everyone who fights in it, they are all mother raping, baby killing, fascists...but I support the troops."

* "Republicans don't care about poor people.  Does anyone else in my gated community agree? My butler does."

* "Bill O'Reilly is a liar. Who cares that he has the number one watched cable show in the world." Not to say that Bill O'Reilly is not a liar.

* "It's conservatives fault we have high gas prices. Do you know how much it costs to fill up my mini van when I drive my 4 ugly, c-student kids to no-contact tag practice or to leadership counseling?"

* "I'm pro-choice. And no, its not because I'm to fat and ugly that no one will fuck me...FUCK YOU GEORGE BUSH!"

* "King George McChimperor BusHitler killed my dog!  FUCK YOU GEORGE BUSH!"

* "BREAKING!  Ron Paul supporters and Hillary-loving PUMAs caught red handed giving donations to Blue Dog Democrats and Ralph Nader.  And I just lost my job.  Waaah!"

* "Global Warming: It's MUCH, MUCH WORSE than we thought 3 days ago when I posted my last panic diary about global warming"

* "Stop calling it 'global warming' dammit, call it 'global cooking' or 'global baking'.  'Warming' is a corporate scam to downplay the urgency.  

* ONOZ WE'RE DOOOMED and billions of people and polar bears are gonna drown because the oceans are gonna rise 50 feet because George Bush stole the 2000 election from Al Gore.  FUCK YOU RALPH NADER!!!"
