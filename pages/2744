Everything is Terrible!
[[Image:Terrible_logo.jpg|thumb|If everything is terrible, nothing is.]]
A promising faculty of [[win]] mixed with [[newfag]], '''Everything is Terrible!''' is a blog set up [[last Thursday]] devoted to perfecting video [[lulz]] that successfully shits on [[new media|social media]] by not allowing [[Fucktard|users]] to contribute their own content. Instead, EIT's [[alone|moderators]] search the bargain bin at Goodwill looking for VHS nuggets of gold that are so rare and unwatchable their [[old meme]] status is forgotten. This has allowed the website to prevent creating any memorable [[memes]] therefore staying untainted by the douchebaggery of participatory culture and focus on cutting edge [[Old_media|ironic humour]].
