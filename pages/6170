'''Target site March 15th:<br>
11AM @ 4810 Sunset Blvd (Big Blue) -- This is the same site that we went to first on February 10th. Due to Starbucks' "No Masks" policy we are likely forgoing a pre-meetup spot. Feel free to show up at Big Blue up to a half hour early.

'''Ground Rules:<br>
Avoid "hate" signs. No "Honk" signs; people will honk anyway. The "honk" rule is a rule implemented by the police. Bring a cake for you and your friends. There will be cake that anyone can have (please be a sharing person!) but don't be upset if someone doesn't want to eat cake, because it might be hard to trust a masked person giving you food. :) This is a birthday protest for L Ron Hubbard, who's birthday is on March 13th.

'''Flyer:<br>

Feel free to make your own, just make sure it has this contact e-mail (hitsut@gmail.com) on it so we can keep spreading the word. Get with some friends and spread these flyers as much as possible =) The "ALAS" government lobby will start on the 26th; more details forthcoming.
