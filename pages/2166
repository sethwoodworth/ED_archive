CTV's advertisement-laden website for its [[teen]] [[drama]] series Degrassi: The Next Generation.  The site was started [[last thursday]], and although initially populated by well-wishers of Joey Jeremiah, who was the [[fag]] in the hawaiian shirt and fedora in the original show, the site soon became a haven for [[prostatot|prostatots]], [[camwhores]], sufferers of [[internet disease]], [[pedophiles]], and other sources of constant [[drama]] interacting with the greasy [[fanboy]] center.  All of this [[drama]] is heightened by CTV's adherence to being [[Canadian]].

The site is littered with posts asking for [[rape|dates/meetings]] in secluded parts of the Edmonton mall, girls who have been [[abortion|pregnant]] [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100 times]] and a selection of [[cutters]], [[furries]] and [[13 year old boys]].  Although the site is primarily inhabited by [[16 year old girls]], the occasional 8 year old [[attention whore]] has been known to post about her 27 year old ex-convict [[pedophile|internet boyfriend]] in Yellowknife.

Degrassi.tv has become an [[anorexia]] support group, a [[teen]] hotline for health issues, usually relating to [[cutting]] or [[abortion|pregnancy]], and love of the boards' most powerful entity, a thirtysomething known as Vitch, notable for not being able to decide if he is a [[homosexual]], a [[furry]], or [[Gorgeous George|both]].

Degrassi.tv is notable for as much advertisement as a tripod site, and for being complicit in the [[Fifty_Hitler_Post|Nazi movement]].

It is notable that the [[forums]] or "clubs" suck ass when dougdafoe is not around.

The moderators have also been known to not let the word [[orgasm]] be included in user's handles.
