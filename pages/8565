Trumi
[[Image:Trumidenial.JPG|thumb|250px|[http://comments.deviantart.com/4/970282/702441830 Typical trumi denial]]]
{{deviantart|trumi|Trumi}}, also known as '''pat''' or '''True me''', was an annoying,naive, [[Engrish]]-speaking [[Poland|Polish]] [[animu]] "[[art]]ist" and a [[drama whore]] [[crybaby]] who quit DeviantART,as he stated-forever, and came back the next day with a bang,
in order to annoy everyone more.

==About trumi==
[[Image:Trumi4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Trumi visits [[you]]r DevianTART page. "Does it satisfies you?"]]
Exactly who-even we don't know !
[[Image:Attention plz.jpg|thumb|"Please see and comment"]]

Attention was all he cared for-so he got what he deserved-a ban ! 

Trumi typically was going around and asked random people to comment on his " old traces". When told he had badly [[traced]]-off his [[shit]], he;s went totally [[emo]] and [[stalking|stalked]] you on the [[Internets]] while [[whining]] constantly and declaring you to be his new "Internet [[friend]]" (or [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2799953/722604435 "fiend"]). Trumi age is unknown (as of 2008) and well,as he was actually quite naive , there could be no excuse for his [[faggotry]].

When called on his obvious tracing, he will do one of these following things:
* Hide the comment ( because he is a coward and a naive one) 
* Send a note to the offending [[tartlet]]/[[troll]](like that would help him...)
* Fire off a long message full of spelling and grammar errors expressing his useless frustration that he can't prove he didn't trace.
(He was not convincing and he couldn't even type properly).

Or he will just flood the offender with a large number of various messages over the period of several days- hoping that he would be forgiven- just like a typical naive fool he was.

{{quote|'Practice makes perfect'|Trumi's "Personal Quote"}}

'Practice' made a fool of you,Trumi ! 

{{quote|Do not have|Trumi's new "Personal Quote" ([[do not want|
plain,unoriginal and obviously not invented by him ]])}}

[[Image:Trumiright.JPG|thumb|center|Trumi agrees (not hidden by him for reasons unknown)]]

All of these proves that he was naive and may have had emotional issues.

==The Trumi Saga of 2008==
===April 27: ED deviantcide===
[[Image:Trumibye.JPG|thumb|Goodbye cruel Internets!]]

On April 27, 2008, within the hours since the creation of this article, the news about it reached trumi, who promtly launched the [[final solution]].

{{quote|Well. It's really high time for me to say goodbye. I have been put to [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Now everyone will learn about my foolishness if they think I am a tracing emo fool. This is the end. Game over. I have removed all deviations and i wish that other artists will remeber me. [[Pwnt|Thanks ElStormo you won]]. Sorry for removing all the favs.|Trumi|[http://trumi.deviantart.com/journal/18050062/ bye !] ''(Apr 27, 2008)}}

{{quote|I didn't expect him to [[delete fucking everything]]... sorry mate, [[I did it for the lulz]].|[[User:ElStormo|ElStormo]]}}

Well, good night sweet prince. 

===April 28: Back with a vengeance===
[[Image:Trumi3.jpg|thumb|You tell the nasty people, trumi!]]

After getting over the initial [[butthurt|ED trauma]], trumi has decided that [[Internets|the world]] would be much less [[lulz]]y without him, and so he has returned the next day from the place where all [[an hero]]es go, and in his own,pathetic words, "some blocks will help". It would seem trumi still holds the people who pointed out his plagiary responsible, rather than the plagiary itself and his lack of skill. [[Denial|Wiping his gallery and blocking hecklers]] will obviously hide the fact that he can't draw for shit and is a complete looser,who fails at life.
He further said he [[George Bush doesn't care about black people|doesn't care about <s>black people]]</s> critics now, and stated:

{{quote|Even ED won't [[rape|bother]] me, becuase I like [[Wikipedia]] (tm) better.|Trumi|[http://trumi.deviantart.com/journal/18066859/ I am back !] ''(Apr 28, 2008)}}

This was already voted [[Lol-cow|as The Greatest Comeback of 2008]]. Curses on you,Trumi !

===April 29: Trumi understands something important===
[[Image:Double facepalm.jpg|thumb|Double facepalm.jpg]]

{{quote|I understood something important thanks to Encyclopedia dramatica. It's purpose is to make people learn on their mistakes and to make them laugh not only at others jokes,but also at ourselves. [[shit nobody cares about|It is very important.]] This ED article is [[funny]] and helpful: it taught me how to behave to not do the same mistake again and to be honest and mention original artists. Also Thanks to them I got over it. I will remember to mention or credit the original users and won't bother others to see pics I have-[[attention]] comes when it wants to. Thanks Encyclopediadramatica staff- Thanks to you I will be a better artist [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|and avoid same mistakes in the future.]] 

Now I understand the true purpose of ED:[[drama|to make people better.]]|Trumi (as ''[[User:Glaci|Glaci]]'')}}

What  a pathetic way to go ! He should have remained silent and embarrassed...
and took his time to reconsider his wrongs.

As written [[vandal|four times in a row]] [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Trumi&diff=1997535327&oldid=1997535225 in this article]. [[You fail it|Way to go]], trumi! 
So just get it,shut up,accept your past and don't make it worse,ok ?

==The story ends==
With the day 2.10.2009 trumi has been banned from deviant art for harrassment.
This was the end of his story with art...or was it ???

We advice you-forget about him.
Even if he has changed or stopped tracing-he will always remain as a proof-
that not everyone has what it takes to become an artist. Just don't 
waste your time with this guy.
