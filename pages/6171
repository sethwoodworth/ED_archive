==RESOURCES:==
http://xenu.net for general information and resources<br>
http://xenutv.com for video. Watch picket clips so that you know what you are up against, especially if this is your first time.<br>
http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology for general news<br>

The rules for this protest will be very similar to the last one. I will come up with a set of recommended guidelines for the protest, and add additional information as it comes in. I am going to try to coordinate the media this time around.

Bring wedding cake for the Brides of March as well; they have a big day themselves.
