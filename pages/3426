Googlewhacking
[[Image:Whack.JPG|thumb|A good start.]]
'''Googlewhacking''' is a game made for sad, lonely internet addicts who want to [[Wank|jerkoff]] [[Google]] for  the search result '1 - 1 of 1'. Googlewhacking was made popular by [[Unfunny|comedian]] Dave Gorman who [[Scam|made a living talking about his faggoty trip]] and inspired a generation of net [[fgts]] to lose a life and any self respect they once had. While most people would stop after about 3 mins of this bullshit, some people can go for months '[[Fap|whacking]]' and is a common event for [[butthurt]] ED [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|vandals]] who [[Death|fail at life]].

==Game Rules==

*Rule Number One: Become [[fat]], have no girlfriend and don't buy anything new (your going to need all your money for the [[Internets|provider bill]]/snacks/drinks/[[Suicide|poision]]). 

*Rule Number Two: Results 1 - 1 only, two words only and they must be in the dictionary. [[Screencap|PICTURES OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN!]]

*Rule Number Four: If you can not find a whack...[[An Hero|go to school for the last time]].
