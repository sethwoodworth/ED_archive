<br>

An expansion pack to the original [[Rules of the Internet]], '''Rule 63''' states that for any given male character, there is a female version, and vice versa. This is likely due to [[basement dwellers]] who are <s>uncomfortable with their true sexuality</s> of an insatisfiable nature. Obviously, it is [[Delicious Cake|time worth]], unlike ''most'' '''Rule 34''''s (who are, in all it's [[Fail|greatness]] only a dick cumming into a tongue that is shopped here and there), since mostly only [[Weeaboo|those with a mastery in drawing skills]] can conjure those levels of [[Fail|perfection]].

'''However, Rule 63 is absolute bullshit, due to it being untrue. Why? Because no one wants to see [[The Young Ones|Mr. Balowski]] as a chick or [[divide by zero|Man-Killer as a dude]].''' If that is the way [[Retard|you]] think, then [[CAPS LOCK|GET THE FUCK OUT MOTHERFUCKER]]. The internet isn't made for pussies like you.


* Keep in mind that all '''Rule 63''' is already a '''[[Rule 34]]'''. If there IS porn of it, then there's porn of [[Alexis|sex-changed]] characters. So [[Protip|don't go]] all [[Nerd|batshit insane when you see a 63 in a 34 gallery]].


==Often Mistakes==
[[Some Argue|Some may]] come to thing that if it's a [[Bridget|cross-dressing]] or a [[Futa]] it is a Rule 63. This is obviously fake, as the same gender still persists. To become a 63, one must go through [[Furries|full sex change]].

Wait, does that mean that a futa 63'd equivalent would be... [[Mangina|OH GOD, NO]]!
