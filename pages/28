'''/tv/''' is a fucking awful board full of spam and reposts. Operating under the guise of a television and film forum, /tv/ hosts the most obnoxious assortment of trolls, pedophiles and aspergers sufferers on the internet. Over half the active content at any given time is copypasta and reposts curtsy of some moron and his proxy. Content on /tv/ rarely strays far from rampant [[America|homosexuality]], [[Asperger|Glauworship]], 0/10 trolls and daily shitstorms over any film made after 1990. A typical thread normally begins with a blatant troll post that no intelligent person would reply to, and two hours later, the now 200 reply thread will still be bumping on the first page.

/tv/ has a unique cycle of hate and love. When a film comes out /tv/ will spam threads 24/7, worship the actor, spam pictures, and invent fan fiction. However after exactly two weeks, [[Hipster|when the general public and critics also love the film, /tv/ will turn their back on said film, and crucify anyone who is still a fan.]] However this cycle was broken with Avatar, and in this case /tv/ hated the film the moment that the trailer came out.

One of the most depressing facts of /tv/ is that most posters are too addicted to the board to even watch films or television. Instead they choose to while away their lives forcing memes, arguing with trolls and discussing [[Shit|Joss Whedon's latest canceled show]]. Some of these people even [[insane|believe]] they have a chance at making it in the film industry themselves.

Don't bother posting a legitimate opinion about a show or movie on /tv/, as your post will most likely just be bombarded by green text and reaction images. 

==Obsession with [[Lost]]==
/tv/ has a bizarre obsession with JJ. Abrams' [[bullshit|never ending cliff hanger]] Lost. Indeed, fans of the show even managed to steal the 3M and 6M gets (but not the 5M /v/ GET, despite [[lies|claims]] by lostfags to the contrary). Lostfans are a rabid bunch who claim anyone who doesn't lap up the shows bullshit isn't educated enough to understand it. They brand any comment against Lost a "stale copypasta", and anyone who tries to reason with them an idiotic troll. This obsession is looked upon by the wider /tv/ community with disbelief as to why any one would watch the dumbest shit someone could possibly come up with, let alone actively support said shit and discuss it on an almost daily basis. But then, the same could be said for 99% of what /tv/ discusses on a daily basis.

===An example of LOST fans making up bullshit to fill in the shows plot holes===
Anyone else think that Rose may actually be Desmond in the future? Yes, i know it sounds retarded at first, but just think about it. For one, they both have similar eyes. Look at the eyes. The eyes are always important. And the facial features, there is just something strangely similar about them despite the obvious gender and race difference.

Perhaps Desmond at some point loses Penny and little Charlie Hume and maybe Widmore captures him and, blaming him for Penny's death, injects him with some weird island $#!% that gives him the appearance and hormones of an African American woman. Sometime down the line he loses his memory and believes he is actually Rose, 50 year old black woman from the Bronx. And with all the time travel paradox crap, Rose/Desmond meets Bernard in 2003/2004 or whatever and marries him and gets on 815 and crashes on the island, where past Desmond is still back in the hatch. And now past Desmond and future/current Desmond (now Rose) both exist in the same timeline as a paradox. I know it's far-fetched but I just have this really strong feeling, and they HAVE given really subtle clues along the way. What do you guys think?

==Film Shitstorms ==

===Juno===
/tv/ will deny it, or will possibly not even remember it, but Juno was at first regarded as a fucking masterpiece. It now symbolizes [[Indie|everything /tv/ loves to hate]].
[[Image: Indie_as_fuck.jpg|thumb|right|Pretentious hipster shit]]

===The Dark Knight===
In what may have been the biggest [[Shitstorm|shitstorm]] in /tv/ history The Dark Knight came out, and managed to best show the famous /tv/ cycle. In the first two weeks of its release, /tv/ got a [[Erection|hard-on]] so big that [[Neckbeard|Stanley Kubrick]] could have shot a 3 hour landscape of it. There was even a fucking sticky, an unheard of idea in the land where there be no [[Homosexuality|mods]]. 

However, as is always the way, just over two weeks went by, and /tv/ saw the critics overwhelmingly positive reviews, and the amount of Jew that it was making. So falling back into their semi-hipster, semi-retarded ways, /tv/ turned on the film. Nowadays if one is to post a thread saying how they liked The Dark Knight, they are informed that they are a kid, [[Black_Jesus|an idiot]], and a [[Bill_Hicks|faggot]]. 

===District 9===
[[Image:D9Slash.jpg|thumb|right|The reason no one likes District 9 anymore]]

In an almost mirror image to The Dark Knight, District 9 came out in mid- 2009, and went through the same cycle. If one were to visit /tv/ shortly after its release, it would be surprising that one wouldn't stumble upon Shartlo Copley slash fiction, fooking love notes to baby Prawns, and general overhyping of a pretty good film. But then in came the cycle. And the rest, as they say, is history. 

===[[Avatar_(movie)|Avatar]]===
[[Image:Abatap1.png|thumb|right|Abatap, a crazy Russian Avatar fan.]]
[[Image:Avatar3.jpg|thumb|right|]]

The fa/tv/irgins, being slightly older than the average /b/tard, and slightly younger than the faggots on [[R9K|/r9k/]], of course had a love affair with [[Nazi|James Cameron]] films. Despite them being identical to the Michael Bay films that they hate now, it was only second nature, their first being to fap to [[Jailbait|Selena and Demi]], to get excited about Avatar, even though they had no idea what in the flying fuck the movie would be about - only that it would be about ''avatars'', but then again they had no clue what it was - or what it would eventually look like.

The day came, every neckbeard had greased their forehead, and swept their basement. It was the day that the Avatar trailer was to be released. But wait a minute, before they saw a single second of this trailer Quicktime crashed, proving once and for all that [[Apple|Apple]] is the equivalent to a Chevy Corvair driven by Stevie Wonder. Nonetheless it finally came, and the whole of /tv/ witnessed, [[Furries|FUCKING FURRIES]]. 

However a [[Slavery|select few faggots still have faith in their master.]]

===AVATOLD===

Since the premier of the Avatar trailer /tv/ has criticized and attacked the film and director [[Mega_ultra_super_genius|James Cameron]] for his blue furry fetish. Trolls insisted it was shit and that it would be the biggest flop since Waterworld. After the shitstorm settled and the dust cleared it became apparent that Avatar was loved the world over. James Cameron has now directed the number one and number two top grossing films of all time, [[Fact|making him the most successful director in history]]. The [[Butthurt|Avatar haters]] have been AVATOLD.

===What about older, or foreign films?===
Well no need for that. As every film made before 1980, and not produced in America is pretentious hipster trash.

==/tv/ on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]==
A majority of the [[VIP|vandalism]] on ED surrounds articles about [[deviantArt]], [[furries]], [[fags]] and [[religion]].  However, this article generates an unbelievable amount of vandalism, proving that the rich and sophisticated culture of /tv/ is worse than the bunch of racist pedophile [[13 year old boy|13 year olds]] on [[b|/b/]].

Most of the vandalism comes from one superfaggot who bitches like nothing you've ever seen if you say anything bad about his [[internet girlfriend]] he is [[stalking]], [[fugly|Summer Glau]].  Maybe if he keeps [[white knight|defending her honor]], one day she will drop the restraining orders against him.
