Zeitgeist Movement
[[Image:Zeitgeistmovement1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Might as well be [[Scientology]].]]
The Zeitgeist Movement is the poorly preached activism group for [http://www.thevenusproject.com/the-venus-project-introduction/about The Venus Project]. Its ideas are based on Peter Joseph's second interwebz film Zetigeist: Addendum which is about Jacque Fresco's ''The Venus Project''. Joseph claims to want to change the world for good while insulting bible bashers and the pride of people who've spent their lives doing an irrelevant and pointless job.

Joseph points out what a bunch of sheeple we really are, but because he's such a smug faggot who attempts to convince retards to join the movement using words such as "symbiotic" and "aquitable" he fails to gain much serious interest. He also does far too much preaching to the converted which is much like [[you|fapping in front of the mirror]]. If Joseph didn't want people thinking he's the leader of some cult he shouldn't have named the movement after an irrelevant fucking film.

==Goals of the Movement==
Zeitards aim to replace monies with a new world, assuming people are able to stop being crack cunts and Bieber fags, which is referred to as a Resource Based Economy, which is a hippy notion that everyone on the world can be happy and healthy. 

They say that money is now irrelevant as it was originally put in place as a replacement of trade and barter because there wasn't enough shit to go round, but now we have machines to make as many chocolate bars and [[fleshlight|fleshlights]] as the world needs, everyone can have enough shit. Even [[niggers|Wilbert Bomatay]]. And that over 90% of jobs wouldn't be needed if we replaced them with technology and it became globally realised that being the floor manager of television programmes such as Jeremy Kyle are only going to devour your soul and intelligence. The reason you're doing your part-time Burger King job or whoreing yourself out is for money, if you didn't need money to live, you could do shit you actually want to do.

We live in a derp society where we're told we have to do shit we don't want to or don't like. Perhaps the reason chanfags live on the internet is because they're freely allowed to be the fags they've always dreamed to be. We're so brainwashed we can't even ask, why do I have to do this shit? Answer almost always leading back to money. It's the reason we have more slavery than ever; profit is now a justification for slavery and lack of medical funding.

It is believed that we must address root causes to grow and prosper as a race. The example they give of catching a serial killer and executing him is a great one. People scream for the death of that individual instead of taking him aside, learning what caused the behavior and trying to ensure that aspect of society gets fixed. This is a new and innovative idea. It doesn't sound anything at all like criminal psychology, or investigation, or profiling which we started doing [[at least 100 years ago]].

Education would be based around actually being able to not get butthurt over everything we will face in life and improving intelligence, not information which is only necessary to learn so you can show your employers that you're willing to do any job regardless of whether you actually liked it or not. It's pretty obvious that most of the people who receive an education are still ignorant fucks, with the amount of teen preggers, rednecks and jew lovers, and parents can't be trusted to teach them anything valuable because they also received a derp education.

Joseph addresses these topics for tl;dr people such as yourself on his [http://www.blogtalkradio.com/peter-joseph radio blog] and even has regular discussions on the Zeitgeist Teamspeak channels because he's secretly a massive nerd.

==The Foundation of Stupidity==
The basis of the movement is the information presented in [http://www.thezeitgeistmovementuk.com/site/zeitgeist-addendum Zeitgeist:Addendum]. The creator of the films is one Peter Joseph. This ignorant twat believes that his mother's role as a social worker allows him to form sound judgements of the world of the poor and have-nots. He still manages to be a yuppie independent film-maker on his own time.

==A Revelation==
Once upon a time there was a man who created a magnificent story to manipulate people into giving him their money and subsequently power. He told grand stories that so enamored people and brought them into his fold that their devotion to him at times was limitless. He flat out lied and bent the truth to offer up a grandiose story for his followers, much the same as Peter Joseph. It is clear who Peter Joseph really is.

The reincarnation of [[L. Ron Hubbard]].

Peter is just one boat, a bunch of child cruelty charges, fraud charges, and a mental illness away from being a Clear. Godspeed L. Ron Joseph. Godspeed.

==Zeitgeist Movements Best Student==

[[Image:Studenti.jpg|left|thumb||Peter Joseph Merola on the left with his best student Tucson,Arizona shooter Jared Lee Loughner on the right.]] Jared Lee Loughner is the Zeitgeist Movements best student. Jared watched and believed in the online conspiracy theory film Zeitgeist: The Movie affected Loughner's view of the world. Jared lee Loughner following the tenets of the Zeitgeist Movement took out a politician U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Tucson,Arizona on January 8, 2011 who was shot in the head and killing at least 6 people including a United States District Court Judge, John Roll, and left 14 others wounded.  



==Zeitards in your Life==
Do you have a special Zeitard in your life? Will they not shut the fuck up about the truth about the [[New World Order]], the [[Federal Reserve]], and all manners of other fucking annoying bullshit they are only parroting from the movies? They have most likely just watched Joseph's first video which is actually about the 911 conspiracy theory and near proof of religion being bullshit. Regardless of any evidence he may or may not have, trying to prove either of his opinions on these matters is like telling a faggot christian to prove their god. There is always a douchebag saying "well prove God isn't real." 

It is obvious God isn't real. Or you wouldn't have such bad luck getting [[poon]].


==The Venus Project==
[[Image:Venus_de_Milo.jpg|thumb|right|70px| [[rule34|No exception]].]]
Now we come to the Venus Project. The Venus Project was started a few decades ago by a man named Jacque Fresco. He believes that a resource-based economy rather than a monetary-based economy would allow humanity to expand and grow. Unlike L. Ron Joseph, Jacque was alive through the Great Depression and has worked extensively with the under-privileged. He also does not bitch and whine about stupid shit without having ways to change it and fix it. Nor has he been noted to use manipulation to force his agenda. 

Why Jacque has opted to align himself with this yuppie tool-bag is beyond reasoning. It can only be assumed that the reason is because of Alzheimer's and L. Ron Joseph's siren song; luring him to his death on the rocks. [[troll's remorse|He is mentioned here only because he has aligned his Project with the movement as he actually seems like he knows what he's talking about in general.]]

Fresco's ideas are often mocked because of his allegiance with Peter Jospeh, despite the 94 year old man currently touring the world giving two hour lectures. His determination is comparable to master Yoda, so [[bare props|respect]] to him.

==Critical Questions for the Zeitgeist fanbase==
<center>''You will probably get some long winded explanation that in no way answers any of these questions, something like "in a resource based economy there would be no need for..." or "Things like this are a product of a money driven society..." Ask these questions again and again until you get a clear answer''.</center>
*In a "resource based economy" who controls the the distrobution of food, water and technology? 
*What do we do with rapists and child molesters?
*Are you telling me that rapists rape for monetary gain?
*What do we do for people who can't work and contribute to society?
*What do we do with people that just don't want to work?
*Will there be gulags for people that don't want this kind of society?
*How is this not a bad remake of Marxisim with fancy future looking cities?
*If these cities are so free why are they all focused on keeping people herded together like in a prison? 
*Will there be some sort of SS or KGB type organization to stop people from starting a bartering system that would lead back to currency?
*If a Tesla Coil was a super neat invention that would have solved our energy crysis then why in the fuck does it have to be plugged into a wall to work?
*Why does the Venus project ask for money instead of asking for resources to buil their super cities?
*In the venus project FAQ it sais religion would be allowed but people would not be able to "force" their religion on others. How would this work considering that 9/10 atheists think that someone saying "bless you" after a sneeze is a conversion attempt (the 10th atheist just starts convulsing out of anger).
