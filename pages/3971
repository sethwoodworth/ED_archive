''See same article at [[Uncyclopedia]]''

'''[http://illogicopedia.org/wiki/ Illogicopedia]''', is a [[wiki]] which consists of utterly [[uncyclopedia|unfunny nonsense which no one can understand]]. The wiki's goal is basically to make no sense and be as unamusing as possible. It is widely believed that the bulk of the site's content is created by scripts running random word generators, as it would be quite [[depression|depressing]] to think that people actually write that stuff.  

Formerly hosted by [[Wikia]], it has much of the same user base as [[Uncyclopedia]], which contributes to the unfunniness of the website.

==Slogan Thieves==

*Their slogan, "In illogic we trust."
*ED's slogan, "In lulz we trust."

They stole ED's slogan, inscrutable as it is.




==Illogicopedia's ED entry==


The disappointing result of Illogicopedia's editors actually trying to form sentient thoughts for once, rather than simply slamming their [[retard|helmets]] against their keyboards. As such, it's a sad combination of their standard failed attempt at surreal humor that misses the point entirely and an inane rant on [[b|/b/]].
