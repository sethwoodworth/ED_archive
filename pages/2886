Fatass Denial Bloggers
'''Fatass Denial''' is the LULZy opposite of anorexia: it's when [[fat]] fucking [[hambeast]]s live in total [[denial]] of their bloated existence.  They often have blogs reeking of this [[Fat#Fat_Mentality|fat mentality]], which generates big fat LULZ

Here are some of these bloggers:

==Miriam Lazewatsky==
[[Image:Miriamlazewatskyfired.png|thumb|obese Miriam Lazewatsky claims her fatness is a 'social construction' SRSLY]]
Miriam Lazewatsky blogs at donewiththisshit.tumblr.com. What makes this moron especially funny is that SHE THINKS SHES BLOGGING ANONYMOUSLY...as a result, various confessions she's made about her pitiful fat fucking self are now blasted across teh internet:

Thanks to her obesity, obscentity-laden blogs, we now know all about:

* [http://miriamlazewatskyfatty.blogspot.com Miriam Lazewatsky's sexual fantasies] (involving rape)

* [http://twitter.com/mlazpwn/status/8605819984 Miriam Lazewatsky's Mirena IUD] (which Miriam Lazewatsky BLOGGED is "in love with" TMI!!),

* How Miriam Lazewatsky BLOGGED that she uses the same lube as her parents (ew, just EW!)

* How [http://www.autoadmit.com/thread.php?thread_id=1212387&forum_id=2#14014617 Miriam Lazewatsky BLOGGED about her tits] (G-cups, tracked with stretch marks) and ass ("I have rolls of fat on my back that I'd prefer not to highlight," she BLOGGED)

But a quick scan of Miriam Lazewatsky's blog shows she hits all the bases for [[Fat#Fat_Mentality|fat mentality]]: she blames society for being called a fatass (rather than her FAT FUCKING ASS), she backstabs people on her blog, then screams VICTIM!!1 when the lying fat fuck gets found out, she blames the BANK for her bouncing checks (rather than, oh, her lamebrain's inability to do ARITHMETIC).

Stephanie Vincent blogs at radicalhateloss.com. Which is pretty funny, since she obviously LOVES being a hambeast...or, at least, she loves donuts too much to shut her fucking piehole and go on a diet!

This is my tummy. I love it, because I’m fairly certain it’s not going anywhere. I haven’t always loved it, but I figured out that I didn’t hate it because of the way it looked to me. I hated it because I let other people dictate how I felt about it: it ceased to be my own. 
My tummy has changed very little, whether it’s been attached to a serious athlete or a waitress who eats a free hamburger at work every day. It’s soft and squishy and sometimes people like to tickle it and sometimes people like to be CONCERNED FOR MY HEALTH about it. I’ve defended its existence to family members. I’ve filled it with ill-advised 3am munchie creations. Boyfriends have blown raspberries on it. It’s hiked and biked and rowed and swam all over the place. Once in India I had food poisoning and my host mother rubbed oil on it (something about “drawing out the heat”). It’s part of the physical landscape upon which my life and relationships have unfolded, and that’s why I love it. I love it because it’s mine and nobody else’s.  |[http://thetummyproject.com/post/1239006338 Typical fat bitch] Kath Barbadoro rhapsodizing about her beastly belly on The Tummy Project}}
