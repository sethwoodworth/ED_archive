Gambling
[[Image:Russian-roulette.jpg|thumb|Popular gamble in The Game Of Life.]]
'''Gambling''' is a multi-faceted phenomenon popular in both [[IRL]] and [[OTI]]. Sometimes 'legal' and sometimes 'illegal', gambling is almost always a good way for you to become [[FAIL|very poor]], very quickly and to make [[WIN|rich men]] of those who conned you into playing whatever game you're [[addicted]] to and betting your mortgage, kids' [[college]] funds and your [[marriage]] on. 

Often described as "A GAME FOR REAL MEN, YOU [[Fag|FAG]]."

There are many ways in which you can participate in [[FAIL]]ING.

== Online Gambling ==
A big favorite with [[13-year-old boys]] and [[16-year-old girls]], this form of gambling usually involves their [[parents]]; in that the parents don't know you're running up hueg losses on their Visa cards.

=== Online Poker ===
Since [[ESPN]] decided that [[poker]] is a legitimate sport (despite the lack of any real exertion &mdash; unless you count facial ticks as "flexing") and [[celebrities]] made it ''[[cool]]'' on such TV shows as [http://www.bravotv.com/Celebrity_Poker_Showdown//index.shtml ''Celebrity Poker Showdown''], online poker has become the [[addiction|game]] of choice for [[hipster]] [[high school]]ers.

===[[Fucktard|Typical Online Poker Player]]===
Meet Prahlad Friedman: [[vegan]], Jew [[California]]n, [[weaboo]] [[rap]]per, [[wigger]], [[Fag|online poker]] [[Queen|champ]] - and that's according to [[Wikipedia]].

[[PROTIP]]: You'll wish it was a [[Rickroll]].
<youtube>o-4gT6FJX-M</youtube>
Friedman plays online under the names [[Nazi|Zweig]], [[Indian|Mahatma]], [[Hippie|Spirit Rock]] and [[Pro-ana|Prefontaine]]. Not like you'd ever want to talk to this [[asshat]]. This sort of borderline [[aspie]] [[retard]]ation is encouraged in the poker world to make their [[Unwarranted self importance|players more memorable]].

<strike>What makes it worse is that he's a millionaire. </strike> [[Kewian|LOL broke]]. [[Lulz|Word]].

===[[Online Sports Betting]]===
[[Image:Manningbreaker.jpg|right|thumb| [[I Am In Your Base Killing Your D00ds|In ur Super Bowl, fuckin up ur odds.]]]]
These are websites run by small groups of [[Mafia|similarly interested people]] with [[unlimited disposable income]]. Sports betting has its own language, dealing with [[TL;DR|vigs, overs, unders, spreads, yada yada yada]]. What the language boils down to is that if you don't pay me, [[bitch]], I'll [[OJ Simpson|fuckin strangle your ass]]. Or at least [[rape]] your credit score into dust. Everyone thinks they'll beat the system on a sure thing. Everyone thinks they're smarter than the bookies but we all know the house wins in the end. Every fucking time. [[You]] are no different.

=== Online Bingo ===
One of the most popular online gambling games is online bingo.  According to the Internet Bingo Blog, there are over 357 online bingo sites currently operating.  Some operators require players to download free software to play their games. Other operators use JavaScript or Adobe Flash based games that allow you to play immediately online after registering a player account.

And here is what you play:

== Casinos ==
[[Image:LasVegasSign.jpg|thumb|300px|Disneyland for [[Adult|adults]].]]
A '''casino''' (cash-eee-no) is a magical wonderland, an [[hookers and blow|adult playground]] with bright flashing lights, lots of nose and copious amounts of free booze (as long as you're [[gambling|playing]]) served by aged trollops in mini-dresses and fishnet tights. They're also a great place to go if you're short on breath, since casinos pump their rooms full of pure oxygen to keep the drunken, sleep-deprived [[NORP]]s awake and 'alert' enough to keep on turning over all their money to the [[Mafia]].

Casinos are places where [[idiot]] people pour money into brightly lit noisy machines and [[masturbate]] while waiting to become instantly rich.  Often, casino use is as [[Drug|addicting]] as any other type of [[crack]].

Common fantasies at the casino include "doing" the cocktail waitress, blowing the blackjack dealer or being "[[Fuck|shown a good time]]" by the sexy hotel clerk.  None of this ever really happens, of course, but since "what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas" and no one's stories can ever be verified, such tales of ribaldry abound.

The denizens of casinos tend to be [[whores]], thieves and other dregs of society such as overweight families from the Midwestern United States dressed in matching polyester and dragging four or five screaming kids behind while "on vacation."  These wankers, while commonly seen as prey by the locals of casino-hosting villages, are also the source of much of a casino population's wealth, so the "bleed them till they die" mentality hangs in careful balance with the "show them a good time" ethos.

If a normal person is confronted with a casino, normal human curiosity and thrill-seeking behavior, combined with the urge to "strike it rich" can be an overpowering force sucking the poor person into the maw of despair that is the casino floor.  But strength can be found if one looks away from the [[epilepsy]]-inducing flashing lights long enough to notice the dry, shriveled husks of humanity inevitably attached to the slot machines.

Casinos are found all over the world:
[[Image:Magua.jpg|right|thumb| [[Magua|When the tourist is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies, Magua will take all the tourist's money, so that the tourist will know that his bank account is wiped out forever]]]]
*[[Las Vegas]]
**Wretched hive of scum and villainy. Don't let the commercials fool you. If everyone in Vegas was [[rich and beautiful]] then they wouldn't film so many episodes of "[[Cops]]" there. Vegas seems all cool until you get your drunk ass battered and rolled into a gutter by a couple of [[Weegee|no-neck goombahs]] because you won a few too many hands at the tables.
*[[New Jersey|Atlantic City]]
**Like [[Las Vegas]] except '''all''' the [[hookers]] have [[AIDS]].
*[[Native American|Indian]] Casinos
**Injun casinos are like the payback for smallpox blankets. Like Las Vegas except that the guidos have fucking tomahawks. Don't worry about losing, the tribal council will probably blow all that money on king-size bottles of [[Alcohol|Listerine]] anyways.
*Cruise ships
**A casino you can never, ever, ever leave...unless you jump overboard. This seems like a great idea after you lose your pension at the [[shit|craps]] table.
*Europe
**Home of respected gambling establishments filled with hot and cold running [[pussy]]. Only [[Leave Bond To Me|James Bond]] can afford to gamble here.

== Street Gambling ==
On top of straight-up [[419 Nigerian Email Scams|cons]], like '''Three Card Monte''', played out for [[the white man]]'s [[Jew gold]] on the bustling streets of most major cities, there are many popular [[lose|games of chance]] played in dark alleyways and basements - including craps, [[buttsecks|cock fighting]] and [[Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this|fisticuffs]] - which are especially popular with [[Redundant|broke, alcoholic blacks and Hispanics on parole]].

== Legal Gambling==
===The Lottery===
Many cities, states and countries around the world have legalized gambling in the form of '''lotteries'''. These take place in various forms but are totally not evil like regular gambling since all the money that a bunch of glue factory workers from some crap town you nevar heard of doesn't win is supposed to go to schools or some shit.

Lottery winners are usually the [[Gaia Online|scum of the earth]]. Even when they win millions of dollars they remain [[white trash]], kind of like [[Wigger|Eminem]]. Lottery winners also run into horrible fates with uncommon frequency:
* Rick Camat - won millions in the [[California]] lottery only to be shot to death by cops.
* Oscar Cordoba - stabbed his wife repeatedly and killed his mother in law.
* Gerald Muswagon - hung himself after spending all of his lottery winnings and being arrested twice.
* Iorworth Hoare - won the lottery while in jail for serial rape.
* Kevin Lee Sutton - shot some girl in the head with a .22.

===Horse Racing===
[[Image:Deadhorserace.jpg|thumb|right| Wilbur? Why?]]
Horse racing takes place at large tracks populated by [[Lemonparty|old people]], [[Alcohol|hopeless alcoholics]], the [[poor]], and scared [[white|rich]] people who huddle away from the masses in private booths. Horse racing can be likened to [[yiff]]ing in the sense that they both make you hate animals. The idea is to pick the horse and '''jockey''' (an old horse racing term that means "[[Tom Cruise|freakish midget]]") that [[Mr. Hands|come in]] first.

People at the track put all their faith and hope in losers with the worst odds, hoping that the noble beasts will [[Unrealistic Expectations|break a streak of bad luck]] and make the gambler rich. Then the gambler drinks when the horse loses. The horse, now useless to their owner, is then shot. Either that or they bet for the unbeatable horses that are guaranteed to win. This makes them pennies at a time, barely enough to cover their astronomical bar tabs. The horses that win wear out faster, making them [[DOS|antiquated and useless]] before they normally would - working their way to the [[Tumbles the Stairdragon|inenvitable broken bone]] and [[shotgun mouthwash]].

So horse racing produces two things:
*[[Ireland|Drunks]]
*[[Pwn|Glue from Fallen Horses]]

"OTB" betting parlors are places that allow you to watch horse races and bet on them without leaving the comfort of the bar.

==Stock Market==
Some people like to place all their faith in the [[suicide|stock market]]. In 2007, all teh players in the stock market were [[pwned]]. Some people place the stock market above their very own [[pedobear|allah]], which is actually more rational, considering that the real lord & savior is mr. [[raptor jesus]]. For some reason, people continue to play in the stock market game, they are usually douche bag hot-shots that are most probably very queer and [[homosexuality|love to take it in the pooper from other males]].

==Rock Paper Scissors==
[[File:Scissors-beats-paper.jpg|thumb|Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and [[OJ Simpson|we all beat blondes.]]]]
Scissors beats Rock because you can't cut Paper with a Rock.

Paper beats Scissors because when the Scissors is safely wrapped in Paper you can even run holding them. Even if you trip over a Rock.
