Edward Lewis Brown and a couple of [[rednecks]] in early 2007 decided not to pay their taxes (Which is generally a bad thing to do to the [[Man|the Man]]),  so the feds got pissed, and basically tried to get them for their tax crimes (3 total ,20 including his wifes tax crimes). When the [[FBI|federal agents]] went to get him, they came back unsuccessful, so when "We The People Radio Network" (is an online radio station for [[rednecks]], and people with [[idiots|no idea of how laws work]]) heard about this crap they decided that now would be a good time to get publicity. On the night of July 28th Edward called the radio station telling them that they heard gunshots nearby. Then, Anonymous heard about what was going on, and decided to join in on the fun also. After the first call had been posted on random boards (which was a big no-no on Anons part) random newfags, WoW guilds, and /b/tards decided to take part of the festivities.

==Interesting Moments==

During the online talk show called, WTPRN, /b/rothers decided to raid. One of the most hilarious callers was, "Neil Bauman," calling in to defend his good jewish boy Eric Bauman. They believe in good family values and it is madnesss that people were calling in and saying other wise. Mentions of Mike Jones, over 9000, and pedobear were worked in wonderfully. Jason Worsley, the host, believed the phone call was legit, successfully blaming ebaumsworld. lulz.

==A few problems==

During the raid Anonymous had a few problems with the calling. (Screeners) Even a lulzkiller told them what was going on a few times. One of the hosts on the radio show even found one of the IRC chat rooms #tomgreen, and knew some information as to what was going on and then some. (but it wasn't the main room that started the raid (#fox on 420chan) hur hur hur.)

'''Fun Facts''': Seven of the original OP pics were images of the Oka Crisis, strong evidence that the /b/tard leading the raid thread was a Canuck on the "crazy crack."
