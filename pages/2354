'''[[PROTIP]]''': PastorDavies on AIM.

Pastor [[Donnie Davies]] is a hoax e-sane surrealistic comedian music actor known for reminding us through song of [[Fred Phelps]]' message that "[[God Hates Fags]]". He became [[internets]] infamous after being partially [[ban]]ned from [[YouTube]] for suggesting that [[homosexuality]] was a disease that could be cured though [[love]]. While it is unclear what Donnie Davies' true intentions are, it is obvious he is one obnoxious, attention-whoring, '''fat-ass''' motherfucker. It is assumed that the song "Never Get Ahead," by Chicago All-Star '''Bobby Conn''', was written for Davies. Both Colby Starck (drummer for Bobby Conn) and actor Todd Quillen openly deny they are Pastor Donnie Davies. To this day both claim they are "not that fat."

Donnie's life story. Most assume one can see Donnie during his "gay years" in the background of the clip featuring Bobby Conn (otherwise known as Iggy Pop with a Moe Howard wig).

==Gay Trivia==

*Donnie claims to be [[e-pals]] with gay blogger [[Andrew Sullivan]] [http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish].
*According to Davies' "Love God's Way" webpage, such bands as Wilco, Bobby Conn, The Gossip, Sufjan Stevens, Lil' Wayne, and Queen are dangerously invading family life through [[faggotry]]. Donnie goes onto to explain, "Parents should keep careful watch over their children's listening habits, especially in this Internet Age of MP3 piracy."

{{quote|Hi, my name is Donnie. I'm a youth Pastor from Louisiana re-located to Houston, after [[Katrina]]. I've been working with a new ministry called "Love God's Way" to help spread the Lord's good Word. Hopefully I can meet some new people on the internet and continue our ministry's growth. 
I'm the lead singer in a band called Evening Service. We are a Christian band dedicated to God's word and taking on tough Christian topics, such as [[homosexuality]] and abortion.|Pastor Davies }}
