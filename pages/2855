Fan dub

'''Fan dubs''' are [[shit|irreverent gemstones]] that help bridge the gap between anime released in [[America]] and [[Japan]]. [[Japan]] is usually way ahead of the translated versions in America, and fans that get stuck on a cliffhanger sometimes just can't wait to find out what happens next. Looking at fan dubs is more sensible than having to wait 3 years and paying [[Jews|$59.99]] for three episodes. Sadly, seeing a fan dub might leave one more confused and disappointed than if they were to see the untranslated Japanese version. 

Another use for fan dubs is parody work or tributes of sorts. Surely, nothing is more [[fail|hilarious]] than casting your puberty-entrenched middle school class as the cast of Evangelion! And surely we can all enjoy people being RANDOM!!!!1!1 and saying out of character, dumb shit in cartoon-like voices for hundreds of hours across the entire lifespan of an anime series? The answer is no - what the fuck is wrong with you, haven't you tortured us all enough by wearing your [[Naruto]] headband in public? Why don't you take your stupid PC microphone and [[Meatspin.com|sit on it and spin!]]

A fan dub differs from a [[fan sub]] in that a person records their voice over top of the original actors', whereas in a fan sub, the sound is not altered but a translation of the conversation is written along the bottom of the screen.

==Anime Fan Dubs==
The people that produce anime fan dubs are often your garden variety [[wapanese]]. Their voices are often obscured by their second or third chin, which do not allow their mouths to open fully. Because females might be a foreign creature far too exotic to come into contact with in real life, males who make fan dubs might simply use men to voice act as the female characters. They raise the pitch and produce eerie, shrill voices that even the most pedestrian [[trap|transsexual]] would scowl at in disgust.

As a special bonus, there are two unique categories one can divide anime fan dubs:
*'''Those who try to match the dubbing to the length of time and way the animated character's mouth moves'''. The words are often strained, the grammar is lacking, sentences are unnecessarily wordy or absurdly brief at times and it still looks weird as fuck.

*'''Those whose dubbing begins too soon, runs past when a character stops speaking, and runs over into other character's visible speaking on screen'''. The script might be coherent and the voice acting might be better this way, but it's confusing and looks bizarre and amateur. 

===Programs Used For This Stuff===
*[[Windows Movie Maker]]
*[[Apple|iMovie]]
*[[VIRTUALDUB YAYYYYY]]
*[[Microsoft|PowerPoint]] (For the professionals)
*[[Sony Vegas]] (For the people who like to steal programs)
*[[Adobe|Adobe Premier]] (For those who actually try at life)

==Manga and Anime Fan Subs==
A new threat is coming to your safe, suburban neighborhood. Every single day, thousands of choppily edited manga scans are uploaded en masse onto a website whose servers cannot handle having more than 2 visitors at the site at the same time. The translations are, like the anime translations, often awkward and lacking in grammar. Often, a white square is superimposed over the Japanese text and then black Arial font is added on top of that square. It looks ugly and it reads like something you drunk texted last night.

Anime fan subs, meanwhile, don't go to the extent of completely voicing over all their shoddily translated work. They just leave it in subtitled form, so you can read gibberish while you watch anime, weeping silently in confusion. 

To completely understand the awkwardness of anime dubbing, just read the fan subs out loud to yourself from this gallery. The fan-made translation was bad enough, but when [[you]] are sitting there, scratching your [[neckbeard]] and saying these things out loud, it becomes even worse nonsense. This sort of [[rape]] of the English language could only be rivaled by [[Youtube]] comments.
