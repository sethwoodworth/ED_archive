'''LtFlagger''' ([[Power Word]]: Adam Tyldak) is a family-leaving [[pedophile]] who frequents the game [[Subspace/Continuum]].  At the height of his reign of terror, he was grooming a 15-year-old girl by the name of Tally3993 to be his sex slave.  He was also notorious for [[fucktarded|paying the players on his Hockey Zone team]], Scorgasms.  Players were paid based on their statistical performance, and despite the fact that everyone on this team was [[fail|awful]], it is estimated that LtFlagger has spent [[at least 100]] dollars of his own money on paying his players.  When his [[unlimited disposable income]] ran out due to him being court-ordered to pay his child support payments, he vanished without a trace, leaving many [[retard|talented internet athletes]] high and dry without their earnings.

==Background==

[[image:LTFCR.jpg|thumb|right|LtFlagger on [[Chat Roulette]]]]

LtFlagger first emigrated to Hockey Zone from another area of Subspace, Metal Gear CTF.  At first, his arrival was not very noteworthy.  Nothing was known about him other than that he was a greasy 27-year-old man from Illinois who worked some kind of IT job.  That all changed on one fateful day, when LtFlagger decided to piss into an ocean of piss and introduce his [[CP|girlfriend]] to the [[faggots|fine denizens of Hockey Zone]].

LtFlagger is known for his high sense of [[unwarranted self-importance]].  He will frequently go out of his way to inject himself into chats and forum conversations to brag about himself, his [[pedophile|love life]], and his [[lie|high-paying job]].  He has a very high view of himself in spite of the community's unanimous rejection of his child-grooming, pedophiliac tendencies and profound [[retard]]ation.  He apparently has no shame, going so far as to [[Asking for it|post pictures]] of his [[fat]], greasy self with his underaged girlfriend.

==Tally3993==

In the span of one conversation, LtFlagger managed to morph himself into HZ's public enemy number one.  By inviting his girlfriend and known minor, Tally3993, to come play Hockey Zone with him, LtFlagger showed that he clearly had no qualms with talking openly about their [[rape|relationship]], even though he is 12 years her senior.  LtFlagger had also previously admitted that he had left his family, a wife and three kids, and [[loser|bragged about refusing to pay child support]].  This fact made everyone rage even more as LtFlagger described, at length, his [[rape|loving relationship with a minor]]:

Tally3993 enters the arena to confirm the story, and reveals, among other things, that she is a young girl with problems at home, making her a prime target for LtF's grooming.  Seriously, this shit can't be made up.  The entire conversation reads like a log that [[Chris Hansen]] would be holding as he asks you to [[V&|have a seat over there]]:

Mr.Jack+> wut do u plan 2 b
Mr.Jack+> ltflagger whatis your current career
Tally3993> i have no idea
David Seam> 2: that aside, is it not embarassing around friends when u say u date a 15 year old....its an insult to your intelligence
Mr.Jack+> tally are you planning to go to college
Tally3993> im just doing what i love right now and thats singing dancing drawing
Leafy> oh my god

Leafy> didnt mommy tuck u in
David Seam> ltflagger can u answer my questions plz
David Seam> i feel i deserve the truth
David Seam> 1.  are you some sort of outcast, id say 99% of males in our age would be ashamed of having a 15 year old girlfriend
LtFlagger> Yes nub
LtFlagger> heh
LtFlagger> Not in the least david
Reppotimus> did you see his picture
Reppotimus> straight off of maury
Nub> ROFL
The game will start in 26 seconds.
Nub> The fact that he isnt ashamed of having a 15 year old says a lot though.
The_Crushe> so your an internet predator?
LtFlagger> No reason to be ashamed
David Seam> 2. even if you say ur some visionary who sees above cultural norms and taboo,  do you think you could also possibly be a defective human who cant land a chick on his own mental maturity
Reppotimus> david really giving this his all. i am impressed
Tally3993> i mmore mature than u
David Seam> sure kid
David Seam> shut the fuck up and let adults talk
Nub> David have you ever been in love or do all you care about is the size of one's T&A and how well they put out?
Neverendin> That might be true actually
Nub> Just out of curiousity
David Seam> ok and finally my 3rd question
Tally3993> no u shut up u dont know what my life has been like
LtFlagger> Unfortunately, in todays society, you are as likely to find someone of equal "mental maturity" in a teen, as you are a mother of 3
Reppotimus> U DONT KNOW ME
LtFlagger> Hun, calm down
Reppotimus> ice cream usually works on kids her age lt
Reppotimus> try that
Tally3993> no he doesnt know the shit ive been though he cant judge me and u know it
LtFlagger> Sweetie
LtFlagger> Please calm down?
LtFlagger> He is just trying to get you riled up
David Seam> 3. you guys both have stated you are from broken homes that are fucked up, there is a correlation between this and these fucked up alternative lifestyles you feel are normal
David Seam> what shit have u been through
David Seam> and are you implying your better then me because you have been through feces
LtFlagger> Why is this a "fucked up alternative"? Because it is considered taboo by TODAYS standards? For the vast majority of human history, she would have been married off and started a family with someone exactly like me by now. Sometimes "progress" is
LtFlagger> anything but.
David Seam> well ltflagger
Reppotimus> for most of our history they didnt know a whole lot about mental development
LtFlagger> I suppose my view of equality for everyone would also be a "fucked up alternative"?
David Seam> during hte vast majority of human history black people used to rub sticks together and make ape noises in jungles
LtFlagger> Reppo: We still dont.
Reppotimus> we know more than we did

This shocking admission was followed up by numerous angry threads on the HZ message boards, demanding action against the family-leaving pedophile.  LtFlagger's natural response was to post pictures of how happy he and Tally were together.

File: tally2.jpg|And again.

</gallery>

Tally3993 has never appeared in HZ again following this exchange, and LtFlagger has seldom mentioned her since.  [[murdered|Her current status is unknown]].

==Scorgasms==

LtFlagger wanted to play for a team in Hockey Zone.  He tried so hard to [[impossible|make himself attractive]] to any of the league rosters, going so far as to play the position everyone hates, goalie, on a regular basis.  However, none of the existing teams would accept the pedophile onto their squad, citing [[CP|irreconcilable differences]].  

When LtFlagger realized that he was not going to be accepted onto any of the existing league teams, he realized that his only course of action was to create a team of his own.  However, realizing that nobody would want to play with a morally-bankrupt, child-molesting scumbag without some sort of incentive, he decided to kill two birds with one stone and offered to [[lolwut|pay his players]].  This way, he could play on a team and flaunt around the fact that he makes so much money, [[fail|he can afford to spend it on an internet spaceship hockey team.]]  Don't ask him about his child support payments, though.

Every player on LtFlagger's team, Scorgasms, received a "contract" similar to the one below, which was offered to a player named WhiteIrishRebel.  Of course, seeing as this contract was nothing more than a forum PM sent to each of his players, it was about as legal as a [[truth|27-year-old man having a romantic relationship with a minor.]]  This led to many people being [[butthurt]] when LtFlagger was eventually court-ordered to pay his child support payments and promptly [[quitting IRC forever|quit HZ forever]].

===Payments===

Players on Scorgasms were given the choice of receiving the payments in installments after each game or in one lump sum.  People who chose to receive payments in installments made some money, as they were paid at least initially.  People who chose to receive their payment in one lump sum are [[retard]]ed and received nothing.

==Current Status==

LtFlagger has vanished from Hockey Zone ([[obvious|though he is likely hiding under an alias]]), but he is presumed to still be at large.  His lack of remorse for taking advantage of a 15-year-old girl in a vulnerable situation, or his [[Asperger's Syndrome|general lack of understanding that it was even wrong]], implies that he is likely engaging in similar pedophiliac grooming activities with another underaged girl.
