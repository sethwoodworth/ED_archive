Cyndre
[[Image:Cyndre_noob.jpg|thumb|right|300px|ED users protect the Internet from untold horrors with [http://www.gimp.org/ Gimp].]]

'''"Cyndre the gheyz0r motha fucka"''' (formerly known as Domster until that nick lost all credibility and reputation) is the administrator of his gaming corporation Psychic-doom. Cyndre is "Not your average run of the mill person", and is supposedly rich and powerful (However, he is not [[rich and beautiful]], as his picture proves), with "At least .1%" of his trained elite force willing to eliminate his enemies at his very beck and call. One wonders why he still lives in [[Canada]] if he's so god-damned rich.

He is currently in preparations to launch a multi-million dollar [[internet lawsuit|Internet lawlsuit]] against [[ED]] and its owner [[Joseph Evers]], justified by damages caused by his [[deflamation]] by the evil [[internets]].  According to Cyndre, damages has been done to, but are not limited to his mother, kids, wife, uncle, business, all of which are probably worth $30.  But let's be fair, $35 with inflation, don't be an insensitive fuck.


== A Product of Incest ==

Currently speculation abounds that Cyndre is actually a [[retard]] ([[down syndrome]]), not just a [[fucktard]]. This also lends weight to the [[Incest|MystForm-as-Mother]] viewpoint.

==Scar?  What Scar? ==

The mystery of his scar has puzzled countless anthropologists. Possible causes:

*[[Skullfuckery]] accident
*Got too close when [[yiffing]] a [[dragon]]
*Consequence of diving headlong into his [[internets]] millions
*Result of a barroom brawl with [[Jimbo Wales]]
*Removal of implants as a former drone in the [[Star_Trek|Borg]] collective.
*Caused by [[Duke Otterland|Duke Otterland's]] antlers during a hot, but totally not [[ghey]] kiss
*Shit, what can I say man?  Don't eat out [[Ann Coulter]]
*Where doctors inserted [[Lobotomy|frontal lobe]] tissue, in order to give him the motor skills to use a computer. 


==Cyndre is a Con Artist==
Cyndre runs 'donations' on his server where people can pay him money to get stupid items in the game. He calls them donations because he is illegally running a Mu server so he doesn't want to get in trouble. Daily, he bans people from IRC if they come in and ask why they haven't received their items that they paid for.

On this little game, there are special items or something, which get duplicated, and in order to stop the cheating he said that anybody who hasn't donated to him would get all their special items deleted. So everybody with the special items who had not donated yet did so in hopes that their items would not get deleted. Then, after everybody donated, he deleted the items anyway.


== Imaginary Wife ==
[[Image:Coulterdry.jpg|thumb|right|His wife.  Who totally took that picture, so it's copyright, you know. [[kthxbye]] ]]
Cyndre's biggest fan is his mother. She has a [[centipede filled vagina]] and is very concerned about "young Cyndre" losing internets millions as a result of [[ED]]. ([[User:MystForm|Some people]] claim that [[cunt|MystForm]] is Cyndre's wife, not mother. This is unlikely because even a man that ugly could not possibly be desperate enough to marry such a raving [[bitch]]. This woman is totally [[asking for it]].) She was so concerned that she posted the "takedown request" she submitted to the ED [[Attorney at lol|Attorneys at LOL]] to the talk page of his article, reprinted here for [[lulz]].

=== You People Are Insensitive Fucks. ===

'''FW: Image takedown req'''

''You people have no idea what sort of economic fall-out you can have on young Cyndre.  He could lose millions because of this article, and it's all because you little punk ass kids talking shit to people on the internet.  Putting pornographic images on his kind of site when he logs in and your the admin and you the person that just banned him you mother fuck.  MY EMAIL, WEBMASTER@PSYCHIC-DOOM.COM.  Now take down this article or literally i swear to god I will come over there and MEET with you people at your school and talk about ur little system administration. FINE! Now take it down.'' --[[User:MystForm|Cyndre's Anonymous Friend.]]

=== Is "she" a sock? You Decide! ===

 00:40 -!- Cyndre is now known as MystForm
 00:40 -!- Cyndre [domoneya@serious-BD704744.cable-lynx.net] has joined #arbchat

Here, Cyndre claims to have edited his article 6 times but the only user he could be referring to in the [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Cyndre&limit=500&action=history edit history] is [[User:MystForm|Mystform]]. 
 01:21 < Cyndre> I edited it.
 01:21 < Cyndre> 6 times
 01:21 <@zionistacat> lol
 01:21 < Cyndre> it was changed each tiem
 01:21 < Cyndre> thank you very much
 01:21 <@yirimyah> no, i meant the chatlog
 01:22 <@zionistacat> its a wiki

Pictorial evidence of MystForm is inconclusive. While it does lend [[fat|weight]] to the argument that she exists, pictures only show her from the neck up. (Unfortunately, she has a face only her husband could love.) It is believed that MystForm is either an obese hag or possibly a [[homosexual|drag queen]] since gay marriage is legal in Canada.

== Moar Socks! ==
[[Image:Zc-cyndre.jpg|thumb|150px|Is Zionistacat a Cyndre sock???]]
It has been rumored Cyndre is looking for new socks, and to prove his 'diversity' is looking at Iran for a new 'mate.' Should he fail with his [[Canada|Canadian]] "deflamation" suit, he will then have a nuclear arsenal to fall back on. Look out, ED!

'''People who may also be Cyndre'''
* [[User:Zionistacat|Zionistacat]]
* [[User:Miltopia|Miltopia]]
* The [[Pope]]
* [[Jacknstock]]
* [[Feltcho]]
* [[Steve Ballmer]]
* [[Your Mom]]

'''People who are definitely not Cyndre'''
* [[User:Thedreadedkettle|Ket]]

=== Is that the real truth, Cyndre? ===
As part of his devastating [[lol|"deflamation" case]] Cyndre claimed his [[Roman Shower|picture]] was somehow stolen from his computer. Probably by the [[13 year old boys]] that play his retarded game.
 06:49 < Cyndre> because I feel that its deflamatory towards my person and having
                 a picture of me that I didnt post is privacy invasion, because we
                 never posted that picture on the net
 
 06:53 < Cyndre> I agree with you tfo, but when stolen pictures and real names are
                 used its not funny any more
 
 07:27 < Cyndre> I tried to talk.  Thanks for deflaming me, my website, and posting
                 a picture you have no right to even possess.

But the hardworking and diligent ED users have uncovered some evidence that casts doubt on Cyndre's claims of data theft...
 <Cyndre> www.webstickys.com/Cyndre.jpg
 <max_> Cyndre: we've stopped pasting links to revolting images now
 <enok> LOL
 <enok> LOLOLOL
 <Chillin> holy shit your ugly!...almost feel bad

This was posted after everybody else in the chatroom showed their pic. He then called everybody fat and ugly and stuff, so they asked him to show his pic and he did.  Could it be that Cyndre posted his own nauseating mug and, upon being laughed at, removed it in a profound fit of [[butthurt]]?

== Internets Court ==
[[Cyndre/Chatlog|Hey everybody, Cyndre wants to go to internets court because he got "deflamed" on ED]]

  <Tranz> has anyone here seen the front page of www.encyclopediadramatica.com?
  someone SUE THEM.

To help it fund the Internets Court fees, more allegations are required!
