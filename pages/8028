Tardblog

'''Tardblog''' was a [[blog]] written by [[special]] education teachers at different times under the pseudonyms "Riti Sped", "Sarah Hammon" and "Miss Pell." Hilarity ensued, both from sticky-faced tard stories and from the self-righteous harpies who attacked the page with tears and recriminations. Unfortunately, the original site hosted by some guy went down and the new site came up with a new author. There are various archives of the old site on the web. [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is no substitute for [[Google]].
