Murftim 76
[[Image:Murftim_76.jpg|thumb|Tim of Murfreesboro doesn't want anyone to see this picture, so he put it on [[MySpace]]]]
Sometimes, online behavior can be [[Wat do|difficult]] to comprehend. {{lj|user=murftim_76}} posted an invitation on  {{ljcomm|user=nashvillians}} for other couples in his area to meet him and his [[Man The Harpoons|wife]]. In his profile, {{lj|user=murftim_76}} had a link to [http://www.myspace.com/murftim_76 his myspace.com profile], where a picture of the happy couple was available to the [[Internet|world]].

It doesn't take much investigation to get from the invitation to the picture. However, when the picture was posted as a reply to {{lj|user=murftim_76}}'s post, he first complained that the picture was insulting, then deleted the reply, then deleted the entire entry, then left the community and finally went to the extent of [[Deleting_your_LiveJournal|deleting his entire livejournal]].

How bizarre. I wonder if he'll be back.
