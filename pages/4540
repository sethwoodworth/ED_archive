'''Kentucky''', abbreviated '''[[lol|KY]]''', is a largely boring state in [[Dumbfuckistan]] that was founded by Colonel Sanders and his army of chickens. The natives were pecked to death, and the land was settled by [[redneck]]s and [[obese|fat people]] who founded its many trailer parks.

Kentucky is known for its [[KFC|fried chicken]], hills, hillbillies, [[meth|meth lab]]s, and [[Dental plan|toothless residents]]. Everyone who lives in Kentucky wants to leave Kentucky. There are no internets in Kentucky. If you [[cybersex|encounter]] someone on the internet who claims to be in Kentucky, beware, because that is a lie. To see examples of real Kentuckians, simply watch any episode of [[Maury]].
