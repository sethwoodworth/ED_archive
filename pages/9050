Right after [[pornography]], food is the main concern of most [[basement-dweller|internet users]]. Though it is known that people (especially [[Americans]]) will eat almost anything, some foods are harder to swallow than others. Many of the dishes listed below come from [[Asian]] — particularly [[Japan]]. Noticeably, many of these bizarre foods are also considered aphrodisiacs or [[Erectile dysfunction|cure impotence]]. [[Coincidence]]?

<center>'''Not to be confused with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta_(food) Placenta (food)].'''</center>

*Consumption of uncooked human placenta carries risks associated with other human blood products, primarily risk of hepatitis B,C and HIV infection. However, eating one's own placenta does not carry those risks.

*Human placenta has also been an ingredient in some traditional Chinese medicines.

===Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balut_(egg) Balut (egg)]===
[[Image:Balut.png|thumb|300px|Tastes like chicken. Small, gooey, bloodied chicken.]]

*A balut is a fertilized duck (or chicken) egg with a nearly-developed embryo inside that is boiled and eaten in the shell. Popularly believed to be an aphrodisiac and considered a high-protein, hearty snack, balut are mostly sold by street vendors in the regions where they are available. It is commonly sold as streetfood in the Philippines. 

*The age of the egg before it can be cooked is a matter of local preference. In the Philippines, the ideal balut is 17 days old, at which point it is said to be balut sa puti ("wrapped in white"). The chick inside is not old enough to show its beak, feathers or claws and the bones are undeveloped. The Vietnamese prefer their balut matured from 19 days up to 21 days, when the chick is old enough to be recognizable as a baby duck and has bones that will be firm but tender when cooked. In Cambodia, it is eaten while it is still warm in its shell. It is served with nothing more than a little garnish, which is usually a mixture of lime juice and ground pepper.


===Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-cannibalism Self-cannibalism]===
*Some people will engage in self-cannibalism as an extreme form of body modification, for example eating their own skin. Others will drink their own blood, a practice called autovampirism, but sucking blood from wounds is generally not seen to be cannibalism. Placentophagy may be a form of self-cannibalism. On January 13, 2007, Chilean artist Marco Evaristti hosted a dinner party for his most intimate friends. The main meal was agnolotti pasta, which was topped with a meatball made from the artist's own fat, removed in the previous year in a liposuction operation.

*Forced self-cannibalism as a form of torture or war crime is not uncommon. Erzsébet Báthory forced some of her servants to eat their own flesh. In the 16th Century, Spanish colonizers forced natives to eat their own testicles. Incidents were reported in the years following the 1991 coup in Haiti. In the 1990s young people in Sudan were forced to eat their own ears.

*One famous case of self-cannibalism is the Armin Meiwes trial. One of the persons involved, Bernd Jürgen Armando Brandes, had wanted his penis to be amputated; after Armin Meiwes amputated, they attempted to eat it together but found that it was too hard.

[[Image:Monkey brains.jpg|thumb|260px|Still warm.]]
[[Image:Monkey-brains.jpg|thumb|right|Still cold.]]

*Monkey brain is a controversial foodstuff, often attributed to the Chinese, but also found in certain other countries. The practice of eating monkey brains has led to over-hunting in Indonesia, especially due to the unfounded belief that eating the monkeys' brain can cure impotence.

*In Western popular culture, the consumption of monkey brains is repeatedly portrayed and debated, often in the context of portraying exotic cultures as exceptionally cruel, callous and strange, with the following variations:

:*the brain is eaten cooked 
:*the brain is eaten raw (occasionally directly out of the dead monkey's skull) 
:*the brain is eaten fresh, spooned out of the skull while the monkey is still alive 

*Consuming the brain and other nerve tissue of animals is hazardous to health. Besides the high fat content of brains, brain consumption can also result in contracting fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other prion diseases in humans and mad cow disease in cattle.

===Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_mountain_oysters Rocky Mountain Oysters]===
*Rocky Mountain oysters, also known as prairie oysters, are a North American culinary name for edible offal, specifically buffalo or bull testicles. They are usually peeled, coated in flour, pepper and salt, sometimes pounded flat, then deep-fried. This delicacy is most often served as an appetizer.

*Rocky Mountain oysters are sometimes confused with lamb fries or animelles (lamb testicles), which are served in a manner similar to Rocky Mountain oysters. A few other descriptive terms, such as "cowboy caviar," "Montana tendergroins," or "swinging beef," may be used.

*It is a well-known novelty dish in parts of the American West and the Canadian Prairies where cattle ranching is prevalent and castration of young animals is common ("prairie oysters" is the preferred name in Canada, where they may be served in a demi-glace, not deep-fried).


===Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu_marzu Casu marzu]===
[[Image:Cheese maggots.jpg|thumb|Cheese goes well with a glass of wine and intestinal lining.]]

*Casu marzu (also called casu modde, casu cundhídu, or in Italian formaggio marcio) is a traditional Sardinian sheep milk cheese, notable for being riddled with live insect larvae. It is found mainly in Sardinia, Italy. Casu marzu literally means "rotten cheese" in Sardinian, and the cheese is known colloquially as maggot cheese.

*During the fermentation process, the eggs of the cheese skipper Piophila casei are either intentionally introduced to the cheese, or a female Piophila casei lays her eggs in the cheese, sometimes exceeding five hundred eggs at one time. The eggs hatch and the larvae begin to eat through the cheese. The acid from the maggots' digestive system breaks down the cheese's fats, making the texture of the cheese very soft, as described. By the time it is ready for consumption, a typical Casu marzu will contain thousands of these maggots.

*Several food safety issues have been raised in relation to Casu marzu, including anecdotal reports of allergic reactions and the danger of consuming cheese that has advanced to a toxic state. In addition, there is some risk of enteric myiasis, or intestinal larval infection. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Piophila casei larvae are very resistant to human stomach acid and can pass through the stomach alive, taking up residency for some period of time in the intestines and causing stomach lesions and other gastrointestinal problems. The larvae have powerful mouthhooks which can lacerate stomach linings or intestinal walls as the maggots attempt to bore through internal organs.


===Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikizukuri Ikizukuri]===
*Ikizukuri usually begins with the customer selecting, from a tank in the restaurant, the animal (shrimp, octopus, lobster, assorted fish) they wish to eat. The chef, who is most of the time a sashimi chef takes the animal out of the tank and filets and guts it, but without killing the animal, which is served on a plate, sliced, with the heart still beating.

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannakji Sannakji] - Sannakji or sannakji hoe is a variety of hoe, or raw dish, in Korean cuisine. It consists of live nakji (hangul: 낙지, a small octopus) that has been cut into small pieces and served immediately, usually lightly seasoned with sesame and sesame oil. The nakji pieces are usually still squirming on the plate. It can also be served whole.

:*Because the suction cups on the arm pieces are still active when the dish is served, special care ought to be taken when eating sannakji. The active suction cups can cause swallowed pieces of arm to stick to the mouth or throat. This can also present a choking hazard for some people, particularly if they are intoxicated. One must thoroughly chew so that no piece is big enough to stick to one's throat. Some people like the feel of the pieces wriggling as swallowed, and so will not completely chew up the particles. Those who are new to eating sannakji should completely chew it up into tiny particles before swallowing.

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odori_ebi Odori ebi] - Odori Ebi (踊り海老 / 躍り海老, odori ebi /lit. "dancing shrimp"?) is a delicacy of Sashimi. It is translated as living or dancing prawns. The sushi contains baby shrimps (Pandalus borealis) still alive and able to still move its legs and antenna while being eaten. The meal is prepared quickly to keep the prawn still alive, usually dunked into sake in order to intoxicate the shrimp. The person eating the prawn would usually dip the live shrimp into a special dipping sauce and quickly chew on the animal to kill it.

[[Image:Kopi Luwak.jpg|280px|thumb|This coffee tasts like [[shit]].]]

*Kopi Luwak (pronounced [ˈkopi 'luak]) or Civet coffee is coffee made from coffee berries which have been eaten by and passed through the digestive tract of the Asian Palm Civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) and other related civets. The civets eat the berries, but the beans inside pass through their system undigested. 

*While it has been referred to as the world's best coffee, taste is subjective, and the different production modes of Kopi Luwak around the world bring varying results.

*Kopi Muncak (also Kopi Muntjak) is a similar type of coffee produced from the feces of several species of barking deer, or Muntjac, that are found throughout Southeast Asia. Unlike civet or "weasel" coffee, this type is usually not produced from captive deer and most commonly collected in the wild, especially in Malaysia and in the Indonesian Archipelago.


===Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faggot_(food) Faggot (food)]===
*A faggot is a kind of meatball. Faggots are a traditional dish in the UK, especially the Midlands of England.

*A faggot is traditionally made from pig's heart, liver and fatty belly meat or bacon minced together, with herbs added for flavouring and sometimes breadcrumbs. The mixture is shaped in the hand into balls, wrapped round with caul fat (the omentum membrane from the pig's abdomen), and baked.

*Faggots were used as the subject of an infamous 2004 radio advert by the UK supermarket chain Somerfield. The commercial featured a husband challenging his wife's repetitive routine of a set meal for each day of the week. While he wanted lasagne, he was told that, as it was Friday, he was to have faggots. He responded: "I've nothing against faggots, I just don't fancy them."

===Found on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Toilet Modern Toilet]===
*Modern Toilet is a unique bathroom-themed restaurant chain with several locations located in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Everything in the 2800-square-foot, three-storey restaurant is based on items from a bathroom. The checkered tile covered walls are adorned with showerheads, while plungers hang from the ceiling along with fæces-shaped lights. The chairs are actual unworking toilets, dishes are served on plastic miniature toilet bowls, and drinks in miniature urinals. Owner Wang Tzi-Wei opened Modern Toilet after the success of his ice cream shop that sold swirls of ice cream served in mini toilets.

*Owner Wang Zi-Wei, an ex-banker, stated that his inspiration for the bathroom themed restaurant came from a Japanese robot cartoon character, Jichiwawa, who loved to "play with poop and swirl it on a stick." 

*Customers dine while sitting on acrylic toilets adorned with "roses, seashells or renaissance paintings." The tables that the meals are served on are bathroom sinks covered with glass tops. Meals are served in miniature toilet bowls and drinks are in miniature plastic urinals which the customers can take home with them as a souvenir. Dessert ice cream is served in a dish that resembles a squat toilet.
