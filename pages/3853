'''IDK, my BFF Jill?''' is a [[mini-meme]] spouted at random moments, in reference to a Cingular commercial where a [[loli]] named Beth Anne is bitched out by her mother for [[cyber|cybering]] too much with her [[BFF]] Jill. Usually, someone responds '[[AIM|TISNF]]', which stands for 'This is so not fair!', which is absolute [[fact]].

==Spin Off==
Another commercial was released by Cingular in an attempt to gain moar lulz by changing the original commercial, but its fatal flaw was that it was [[shit|not funny]] the first time and so this one [[fail|fails]] even harder.

==Spoof==
This is  a spoof of the original commercial, and is actually funny.

==Techno Remixes==
An animator and music artist known on [[Newgrounds]] as Haxxy has created techno remixes of the two commercials in attempt to restore some of the lulz that these commercials destroyed. The remix created for the first commercial (located [http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/90265 here]) was received well and was soon carried to [[YTMND]] and [[YouTube]] to receive even more views than the original webpage. However, the second remix created (located [http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/95892 here]) never received quite as much attention as the original, although the artist claims to be happier with the end result.
