Leveling up, more commonly known as +1, 1up, and [[World_of_Warcraft|level 48 DemonOgreOfTheNight]] is the process by which a fat nerd can experience the sense of [[xbox|achievement]] of a promotion coupled with the crippling loneliness of a video game. Whilst a real life promotion gets you more money, cool stuff, and of course bitches, a levelup in a video game gives nothing but a longer period of time until your next levelup, and another hefty dose of that crippling loneliness that has definitely not left you a churned up manic depressive just waiting for an excuse to [[Columbine|show them all]]. The same often applies [[IRL|in real life]] when you realize that despite all your hard work, your boss is still seven years younger than you are.

==A Breif History of Levelup==

The year was 1947, and the most advanced technology could not even produce [[gay|light-up fanny packs]], so two Jew [[hax0rz|programmers]] by the names of [[Newton|Thomas T.Goldsmith]] and [[Einstein|Estle Ray Mann]] made the first ever video game, a missile simulator. This was a [[shit|very original]] concept, eons ahead of its time, with the groundbreaking ability to display a [[Atari|small dot dot on the screen]]. Their test subjects soon became weary of the same repetitive tasks, however the developers were lost for what they could possibly offer. A shoddy animated graphic and memorable one second [[web 1.0|MIDI]] sound could never fool people into thinking they had actually achieved something, could it?

After much [[TL;DR|productive collaboration]] they had finally done it, not only had they made the first video game but they had mastered a process by which normal people could complete a series of repetitive tasks, receive no actual reward, then complete a series of slightly different repetitive tasks, and receive no actual reward. The cycle could continue almost infinitely and the people would still sit, endlessly focusing on the task at hand as long as they percieved a light at the end of the tunnel. This beautiful and heartwarming principle remains almost unchanged to this day.

==Levelup in the New Millenium==

Since the "remarkable" invention, levelups have [[cock|penetrated]] their way into the [[basement]] of every [[13 year old|teenager]] alive. Levelups are a valid birth control method, as many young males are under the impression that [[Super Smash Bros|mashing the 'X' button]] for 12 hours will benefit their lives, when in fact it will prevent even the spottiest girl from shuffling off her underoos in order to bounce awkwardly on their cock for 26 seconds.  The [[fail|brilliant plan]] from two fags with more time than sense has evolved from a dot on a screen to a [[ITT Tech|full-fledged cult]]. 

One of the greatest births from this evolution is the new [[gay|fad]] for [[MMO|mmorpgs]] shit, where you basically get to create a character model (made by some [[lonely]] [[fat fuck]] at his mom's house), give it an [[original character|original]] name, select a [[job|class]] (a fabricated concept that deludes you with the notion you're actually [[lie|worth shit]] in life), and sit through some [[tl;dr]] tutorial that [[boring|details the history of fantasy fuckland]] before getting the living fuck [[griefing|PKed]] out of you for thinking you actually had any chance at survival. [[Online]] or [[irl|offline]]. Because everybody [[WoW|gets exactly what they pay for]] rite guise?

==[[Trying too hard]]==

[[You]] try too hard at every game you play, and just because you boast about it, it doesn't mean it is worthy of boasting. Your [[OL]] "friends" (guild [[fag|fuckbuddies]] or otherwise) only care about you when you are being useful, so when you go to school/work and wonder how impressed people are that you spent 20 hours leveling up be sure to bear this in mind.
