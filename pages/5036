Lynzee Stauss
'''Lynzee Stauss''' is the [[16-year-old girl|teenage]] author of a [[old media|school newspaper]] article titled "College Really Isn't Necessary" which first hit the [[interbutts]] in August 2006. The article claims that [[whore|girls]] shouldn't have to go to college because "girls need to be girls and get their nails done or go shopping." Don't worry, though, she can understand if girls want to go to [[pro-ana|beauty school]]. Boys, on the other hand, "need to work if they want a good life ''becasue'' obviously their wives won't be bringing home the money."

Of course, one can just imagine how this played out with the [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] [[nice guy]] [[gamer]] crowd. The righteous indignation among sacks of [[shit]] who make no money and can't land themselves a job anywhere above the ladder than Big Lots was immense.

'''''[[PROTIP]]:''''' The astute reader might realize that Lynzee's article was <s> possibly</s> almost certainly an attempt at satire by a [[dumb]] person. If so, it ended up turning into an unintentional troll of amusing magnitude. Read on.

On February 8, 2008, some clones who run a [[ghey|highly original]] site about drinking and college friended Lynzee on [[MySpace]] and proceeded to steal all her [[CP|pix]]. They then posted every one of the pix (all 96) along with the article and some [[copypasta]] from her profile and said it was "public domain." LOL [[fair use]] [[amirite]]?

The stolen pix hit [[digg]] within hours and made the front page on the morning of February 9. Shortly thereafter, Lynzee [[baleeted]] her MySpace profile no doubt under a massive [[crapflood]] of diggtards and failfags filling her inbox with ranting along the lines of "U WORHTLESS GOLDIGGING [[cunt|CUNT]] U SHOULD BE [http://www.pnwriders.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-22736.html CURBSTOMPED] btw y wont any girls who look liek u an ur friens have [[sex]] with me im a [[nice guy]]"

Shortly after THAT, the college drinking clones [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|deleted the pix]] from their diggbombed server because of "[[lawsuit|business objections]]" from their owners. Well, it's more accurate to say they deleted the ''links'' to the images from their article. Fortunately for enterprising nerds with [[hax|wget]] they were [[win|still on the server]]. :)

==The future==
Certain things are guaranteed.

* Lynzee Stauss will be grounded for 1 week for underage drinking when the evidence is mailed to her house, and later become addicted to [[cocaine]] and [[fat|Slim-Fast]] and get large diamond rings because of it.
* The dudes who stole the incriminating images will be [[FBI|v&]] and [[CP]] will be found on their [[computer|computhars]]. Also [[Anonymous]] will [[DDOS]] their server due to a massive flood of requests for JPGz, but it will be blamed on [[Scientology]].
* [[Basement dwellers]] will fap to Lynzee's slightly disturbing smile for years to come, then post rants with crusty fingers about how all [[women]] are beings of pure malice. Then they will cry themselves to sleep and be late for work at Radio Shack.

The wild card comes if anyone successfully gets Lynzee's [[dox]]. This is likely because her [[PowerWord: IRL Name]] is already known and fairly unique. If this happens there may be IRL trolling and possible [[serious business|srs.biz]].
