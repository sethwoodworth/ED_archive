Popular belief
[[Image:Fanboy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fanboy]]s are often dominated by popular belief.]]
"Popular belief" is where pseudo-solipsism and a complete lack of historical and general knowledge clash together to spawn a mindless atrocity that is already a big wheel in modern civilization's degenerating media-machine. "Popular belief" can be easily defined as every [[fact]] that has been thoughtlessly copied from the sensational [[media]] by [[16 year old girls]], and generally by a lot of brainless fucks. You'd be surprised by how much bullshit you're constantly lured into.

==Examples of popular belief==

* There were no [[WMD]]s in [[Iraq]].
* Israel is a [[terrorist]] nation.
* We spend 1/3 of our lives asleep.
* Green Day is an innovative band because they won 50 Grammies.
* <s>[[Hitler]] only had one testicle.</s> [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1087380/Did-Hitler-really-ONE-testicle-A-historian-sorts-extraordinary-truth-far-flung-myths-Fuhrer.html OOPS LOL IT'S TRUE! (but not for the same reasons as the song says)]
* [[Windows]] Vista = [[gay|God]].
* [[Chris Crocker]] is human. (LOL J/K)
* [[W|Government]] did [[WTC]]
* [[Wikipedia]] is an encyclopedia that [[faggots|anyone]] can [[edit]].
* Anything said on [[Digg]].
* [[Cho|Cho]] didn't do it for the [[lulz]]

Be warned; it's NOT [[true]], quite the contrary actually.

== A class on its own ==

People who believe all this nonsense are also those who keep bothering you with their blunt and obtuse [[opinion]]s on whatever matter it is they have absolutely no expertise in. Sadly, if you'd just take a look around your direct social environment, you'll find numerous people qualifying these criteria, hell, you're probably one of them, you vacuous shit, I can already hear the mindless winds shrieking through your skull, just [[gtfo]] already, black person!
