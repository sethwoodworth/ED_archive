'''Pop parenting''' is a tactic of [[babyfuck|childrearing]] that is becoming increasingly popular on the [[Internet]], especially [[LiveJournal]], where mommies compete to see who is the best parent and no one wins because it's [[retarded]] and no one cares [[IRL]]. 

Pop parenting is, inherently, doing whatever the Internet tells you to, including not vaccinating your children and copping a holier-than-thou attitude when faced with any other e-parent. Misleadingly labeled "attachment parenting", nothing really matters except pretending you practice obscure and wholly inefficient parenting techniques, making huge posts about how [[waffles]] kill babies (see [[Nouglybabies]]), quoting fake studies, saying how their [[religion]] is best left for them to decide ([[Star trek|or create]]) by themselves, posting pictures of your [[babies]] [[at least 100]] times per day, and eventually turning your children into the shrieking hellbeasts that justify the attitudes of [[childfree]] folk everywhere. 

The best part about this parenting technique is that, in reality, pop parents are so busy on the [[Internet]] arguing about how formula and doctors suck and talking about their [[moontime]], that their kids really sit in playpens [[Angelique_DeSatanos|neglected all day]]. 

A sub-breed of the pop parenting phenomenon, [[Boob Nazis]], spends a lot of time talking about how letting a 5 year old breastfeed is totally okay and not sexually [[pervert]]ed at all, scolding those who dare to give their children a bottle, and generally being [[retarded]]. So-called "mama [[drama]]" is a source of [[lulz]] for many, as evidenced by [[Nouglybabies]]. 

== Pop Parenting Sites ==
===Mommy Connection===
This is a popular pop parenting [[forum]], in which access is granted by the [[admin]]s. This is solely to show who is really running the show. You are promised a laid back atmosphere with little [[drama]]. Attaining access is easy, just say you have a cooch, you like anal sex and you have a few [[babies]] running around somewhere, and they will let you in.

Do not be fooled by the charming colors. These women are [[boob nazis]] who will defend the teat at all cost. They will make sure everyone knows that only bad moms feed their children formula. A way to get them all worked up is to mention that you've had your son circumcised or use the term [[retard]] to describe an idea you do not like. 

Most of these women are from the St. Louis area, which that statement alone tells you that the majority are [[fat]] [[whore]]s who shop at [[Wal-Mart]]. All intelligence is lost, as these women are self-proclaimed professionals, while they stay at home being a maid to their milk-puppies. A large percentage of these women are [[fugly]] and fat and will make [[at least 100]] threads talking about the fantastic sex they had. Of course, according to most of them, they are fat because of genetics, not necessarily due to the double-pounder they just inhaled. [[Pity sex]] or no sex, that's their motto!

Due to their unfulfilling [[IRL]] lives, most often come [[online]] to berate a someone that pointed out the fact that they are all [[fat whore]]s. They will mount up their [[clique]]s and then start with calling everyone a [[troll]] or [[drama queen]]. This of course, makes them seem smart to themselves and their parenting skill far surpass those of the other moms on there.
