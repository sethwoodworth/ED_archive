'''Ph33rForums''' are where all the crazed [[13-year-old boy|fans]] of DigitalQu33r flock to in an attempt to find out when the latest episode of Ph33r's [[Gay|awesome]] [[Machinima]] productions will be released to their prepubescent, whiny little hands. It is very well known for housing [[internet]] idiocy that could make even [[/b/]] [[newfags]] become [[an hero]]. The site was conceived [[Last Thursday]] by DigitalPh33r after seeing his [[blog|Blogspot]] overrun by inane comments and death threats by his [[Aspie|troubled fans]], thinking that shifting to a forum would solve all the problems of the internet. However he was sorely mistaken, and the forum was flooded with [[newfags]], and the situation went from bad to worse. However, Ph33rForums is home to many [[Gay|intelligent]] and [[Troll|awesome]] people who will frequently [[Did it for the lulz|do it for the lulz]].


== The forum community ==
===Game nights===
[[Image:Contest.jpg|thumb|right|DueLearner showing his organization skills.]]
The DigitalPh33r community is well known to be a close-knit and sometimes [[Gay|questionable]] one, but despite all odds they have managed to pull off some feats of accomplishment. For example, a weekly '''''Community Game Night''''' takes place in which all of Ph33r's [[13 year old boy|fans]] face off in [[Halo|Gaylo 3]] matches to prove their [[win|victory]] over one-another. It is a well known fact to everyone, even those who [[newfag|haven't even played them before]] that the Ph33r CGN matches are made of [[AIDS]] and [[fail]] and should be avoided at all possible costs.


== How to win (and fail) at Ph33rForums ==

Because of the fleeting levels of [[nerd rage]] that surmount within some members of the forum, it is a well known fact that Ph33rforums is comprised only of [[rage]] hungry idiots who [[baw|angrily pound their fists at the keyboard then proceed to steal cars and beat up old people]]. The few more sensible [[fucktards|members]] at the forums will proceed to flame and burn these users as they slowly back away from the resulting cesspool of [[nerd rage]] and will almost always be [[ban|PERMAB&]].

Looking at these two sides of the field, the ones who proceed to flame those have raged seem to be given priority, not the other way around. Unlike most places on the [[internets]], Ph33rForums is known to [[Haet|look down upon]] excess flaming or trolling, and one day of clever jokery will land you in hot water from the forum [[fags|regulars]] and probably with a sharp [[banhammer]] shoved up your cervical tubes in an effort to get rid of anything [[funny|unfunny]].

'''A comprehensive guide:'''

1. Hate DigitalPh33r

2. Bitch and complain until your [[Angry German Kid|keyboard breaks in half]]

3. Be flamed and burned

4. [[Hax]] the forum leading to mass confusion

5. Repeat step 5

6. [[????]]

7. [[Profit|PROFIT!!!!!]]


And remember everyone, the more you swear, the edgier and funnier you'll be!

No you betch. Heh. Kate rulez FTM droolz.

== The Random Section ==
[[Image:Newinternethatemachine.jpg|thumb|right|When you see it, you'll shit bricks.]]
[[Image:BelAir.png|thumb|left|One of the more epic of wins achieved.]]
The [[/b/|random]] section of Ph33rForums, also known as '''''/DP/''''' or '''''Diet [[/b/]]''''' is one of the ultimate cesspools of [[win]] and [[justice]] on the internet. Several [[epic win|epic wins]] have taken place there, many of them achieved [[for great justice]] and future viewing.
Occasionally however, the dark side of the [[internets]] can show through here and [[drama]] will ensue leading to [[haet|haetred]] on the forums and potential ban. 

A large controversy occurred [[last Thursday]] when some [[faggots|forum members]] got fed up with the excessive [[meme]] [[Copypasta|references]] made on the forums. They declared that [[meme|internet memes]] are [[serious business|SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS]], and moved to have several respectable members [[ban|B&]] because of it. However, after an [[Flame war|agreement]] was reached, [[faggotry|peace]] occurred on the forums as an [[Creepypasta|unusual]] twist of fate.

{{quote|<small>It's getting excessive, honestly, it was funny for about 5 minutes, then you \b\tards had to carry on and on posting all night with yuor random images of pure bullshit. It's not funny, It won't be anymore it has just aggrivated most of the forum goers, beacuse we cannot make a topic without it being spammed to living shit with complete and utter nonsence.

Please, I and many behind me, beg you, Stop with your fucking lame 4chan memes, keep them at 4chan, or whichever chan you frequent. Keep that shit out of here.</small> |Koala, declaring [[haet]] on internet memes being used on our innocent little forum.}}

== The Death of Ph33rforums ==
At least 100 years ago, Jon BAAAAAAAAW'D over all of the people harassing him and asking him asl. So he asked the admin to [http://www.digitalph33r.net/index.php shut down the forums.]

Before it shut down however, the admin informed the users that he was making another forum that was exactly the same as the old one but with references to Mr. Ph33r removed.
== Much ado about Nothing ==

When your fanbase is comprised entirely of [[13-year-old boy|13-year-olds,]] you're guaranteed to be on the receiving end of [[butthurt|butthurt]] and [[BAW|BAAAAWS]]. Digitalph33r is no exception, and ever since he disabled comments on his blogspot, the whiny brats have made Ph33rforums their official Myspace for whining about how [http://digitalph33r.forum2u.org/this-is-bullshit-jon-read-this-t3536.html Jon ruined their lives.]

These comments manifest themselves in two forms: the [http://digitalph33r.forum2u.org/wtf-digitalqueer-t3724.html illiterate moron,] or, occasionally, some supposed TROO MASHEENAMA ARTEEST will pop out of the woodwork and say what everyone's already known since [[Last Thursday|last thursday]]; namely, that Digitalph33r is a talentless hack. Um...No shit?
