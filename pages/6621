'''Peter Turner''' aka '''Proffate''' or '''Lanceypoos''' is a well respected member of the [[deviantART]] community. This of course is not surprising considering that he is in fact a [[Coppercab|ginger]], [[tranny]], [[furfag]] and tartlets of all avenues tend to be sick fucks who get off on this kind of shit. He also likes to hang around at [[Fur Affinity]] where he keeps all of his [[furry|furfaggotry]] hidden away from his "professional" [[deviantArt]] account. Peter makes hilarious [[troll]] bait for several different reasons, chief among them being mentioned above. He has the strange delusion that as a [[transexual]] he would make an excellent [[Obvious|trap]], despite the fact that he looks like a mysteriously carrot topped, albino black person.

== Obsession With Herro-Roo ==

[[Image:3572321739 be3aa7e331 o.jpg|thumb|100px|Team Rocket never looked so repulsive.]]

Another odd delusion of Peter's comes from his [[Internet Stalking|infatuation]] with fellow tartlet [[engrish|Herro-Roo]], a female [[furfag]] who gives him the horn. According to one of the many garishly vomit inducing pieces of "[[art]]" he has created for her, he has been [[Doing it wrong|trying to get her to come and stay with him for Christmas]] [[Its a trap|for the last four years.]] It seems old [[faggot|Rocky Horror]] here is [[Dying alone|pretty useless at taking hints]]. He has requested pictures of himself and Roo together from a number of different artists, including a sketch where both of their "fursonas" are [[wut|male and sucking one another off.]] This creepy [[Brian Peppers|stalkerish]] behaviour around her seems [[weeaboo|"kawaii"]] to most of the mentally defunct furfag community, but even one or two of their sweaty, [[neckbeard|neckbearded]] number have pointed out that it's more than a little bit creepy. If you really have it in your mind to troll him it is suggested you bring this issue up, it tends to result in some delicious cyber rage.

Recently, his [[Chris-chan|love quest]] came to an abrupt [[Fail|end]]. Though he didn't go into details, one can only assume his [[shit|creepy presents]] landed him in absolute [[Mary Sue|trouble]], Which of course caused him to be [[lie|swearing to no longer to swoon after her again, talk to her, or even think about her what so ever. At all.]] Which is [[bullshit]] because everybody knows that all [[furfags]] [[Srs_bsns|never give up on their quest]] for [[cock|love.]]

{{quote| '''You may notice that Herro aka Drip Dry has been removed from my deviations, and my [[Emo|life.]]
I'm not here to slander anyone but suffice it to say, [[Cool story bro|hearts were broken]], [[ಠ_ಠ|and through no fault of my own.]] [[Success|We'll never be speaking again.]]'''|Peter Turner being [[butthurt|heartbroken]].}}

What's even more upsetting is his [[Truth|slanderous usage]] of the word [[bro|'Bro']] to describe another [[furfag]], because clearly she's not a bro- Also, to this black person[[watermelon|nose]], she's more of a [[rape|target]].

== Flash Videos ==

Peter creates flash videos, all of which are considered genius by his peers but completely lacking in originality by everybody else. He steals his ideas from viral trends, internet [[meme|memes]], metal bands and [[wapanese|Japanese]] children's cartoons but fails to make anything even fleetingly humerous from them. They seem to alternate between chronicling the adventures of his delusional life to random furfaggotry and other [[shit that nobody cares about]]. Watch them at your own risk, they have been known to cause chronic cases of [[diabeetus]] in the [[loli|young]] or [[cancer|terminally ill]].

== Refusal To Vote ==

[[Shit_nobody_cares_about|During the December of 2009 Peter thought it would be a good idea to refuse to vote in the Australian election, this resulted in him being fined one hundred dollars. Because of this he baaawwed in his journal and pleaded to his watchers for commissions. Why he couldn't just do a decent days work for the money (or just fucking vote) nobody knows, maybe the fact he is a human leech had something to do with it. Needless to say the ever predictable furfags in need of kiddy porn and fuck knows what else drained their parents bank accounts and saved the filthy tranny from what should have been a well deserved bout of prison rape.]]

Boy, [[liar|politics sure are interesting]]!

== Transexualism ==

[[Image:862216white-chicks-posters1.jpg‎|thumb|Yes even two negro actors in make up look more like a white chick than Peter does.]]

As has been mentioned Peter is a [[Special_poetry_slam|tranny]]. He prefers the term [[Faggot|"transgender"]] however and gets [[RAGE|annoyed]] should you call him by any other [[Powerword|name]]. For some obscure reason he believes he makes a [[lolwut|beautiful woman]] despite having the most gigantic nigger nose it's possible to see on a caucasian. He also has an absolutely terrible complexion and a head shaped like an easter island statue. All of these features combined make perhaps the most non feminine look a person could possibly have. One could even stoop to saying that Peter may well be the missing albino love child of black person and that [[lol|black midget]] from Leprechaun 2.
