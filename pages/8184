[[Image:ED_civil_war.jpg|thumb|250px|The '''ED Civil War''' in a nutshell.]]

It is the fate of every popular website on the planet to become the grounds for a squabble so huge that it divides the majority of its users. Some users side with the original site and its administrators and some attempt to found [[List of *chan boards|rival websites]]. It usually happens after the original site has been around for a while. [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] was born in [[2004]] - and since about the age of [[shota|4 began to feel the first effects of being fucked from the inside]], kind of like [[Madeleine McCann]].

==War? What War?==
[[Image:ED-is-not-Hitler's-Uncyclop.png|thumb|We are funny]]

[[Some argue]] there is no 'civil war' - just a bunch of butthurt users clawing and screaming at one another as all good [[trolls]] do.

===This is not a War...===

[[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is '''[[DRTISC|not]]''' homophobic, sexist or racist because there is a page for literally everyone on ED. [[You]] only have to look at the [[Loli]] page to realize nothing whatsoever is sacred.

Cliques (including, but not limited to) [[Niggers]], [[Furries]], [[Jews|Kikes]], [[Muslim]]s, [[Fundies]], [[Faggots]], [[Armos]] and [[moot]] are all very easy to make fun of because of the evolutionary flaws which drag them to the bottom of society - not unlike [[pandas]].


Other groups - [[men]], [[white people]], [[heterosexual]]s etc. are more difficult to make fun of, since they are considered the norm. Their pages are written like somebody read one of the pages about themselves and decided to even the score. Replace the word "nigger" with "cracker" and you've got the page on white people, even though Caucasians are much further up the evolutionary ladder.

Such edits usually cause [[baw|arguments]] like these:


*''This page is unfunny. A butthurt reader saw a better page and tried to get their own back. --Lulzlover
**''Lolwut this article is racist/sexist/prejudice for the lulz! [[My Immortal|You motherfuckers]] can't handle being told what goddamn fucking disgraces you are! Don't forget the suicide note on MySpace before [[an hero|you go]]! LULZ --Drizzlingcumbucket
***''Your edits are a load of bullshit - you're just some [[newfag]] who thinks he's got anonymous on his side! --FuckingMudkipsYEAH
****''You have NO IDEA what satire is do you? --Monkeyspunk
*****''Stop [[BAWW|BAAAAAWWWWWW]]-ing about the fucking page and rewrite it yourself you fucking crybaby! --Buttonhole
******''LOL the talk page is even funnier than the article --Heyguiselol
*******''NIGGERS COCKS JEWS FAGGOTS LULZ AM I RITE --Anon789
********''Y'all niggas are posting in a troll thread --[[lemonparty|Al Sharpton]]
*********''FUCK [[your|YOUR]] SHARPTON -- Vanessa Hudgens
**********I can't believe I created this page. Seriously, what was I thinking? [[facepalm|*facepalm*]] -- [[Writing yourself into an article|MudkipsPlz]]


[[Image:Kid VS Cock.gif|thumb|Some wars are more frightening than others.]]
Many pages on [[ED]] have editing wars which involve users [[cutting]], [[butthurt|vandalizing]] and [[no u|insulting one another]] on the talk page. Eventually some of the users will be named and shamed for being hypocrites who like to dish out the shit but can't take it themselves if they're lucky, but are usually [[B&]] for their faggotry. They are the lifeblood of [[ED]]. This is not the so-called "Civil War". Such [[Jesus|sacrificial lambs]] are [[Drama|what keeps ED going.]]

Examples from the talk pages:

*[[Talk:MySpace Trolls|MySpace Trolls]] [[Wikigroaning|(the talk page is longer than the fucking article)]]
*[[Talk:White_people|White people]]
*[[Talk:Atheist|Atheism]]
*[[Talk:Man|Men]]

===''THIS'' is a War===
[[Noone]] has firmly established the exact start of the war. Most likely, it was shortly after [[anonymous]] declared [[jihad]] on [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Scientology]].

Most of the bullshit that [[anonymous]] gets up to is confined to the internet. Seeing an opportunity to cause some [[IRL]] damage, members went and protested against this false religion, and this is where the trouble started: Anonymous - which attacked those who took the internet too seriously - were starting to take themselves too seriously; and became what they [[irony|hated most]].

====The [[Retards|Players]]====
[[Image:Anothernewfag.jpg|thumb|Your typical [[ironic|ED hater]]]]
[[Image:Beef!.jpg|thumb|right|The fight continues...]]

The battle is not only between moralfags and hatefags - it's also between newfags and oldfags. [[Sarcasm|Even the internet is not safe from drama]].

Originally the newfags and moralfags were attacked for ruining Encyclopedia Dramatica's [[Irony|good name]]. It was turning the sacred [[internet hate machine]] into a cyber vigilante patrol - destroying the very purpose of ED. Sadly the [[SysOp|mods and admins]] either couldn't ban someone for being [[unfunny]] or were too damn lazy to spam their userpages.

The newfags and moralfags re-grouped and started freely [[internet tough guy|attacking]] users who had pointed out their faggotry by saying the oldfags [[lie|weren't funny anymore]] and that hatefags were too dumb to realize that the best way to really hurt someone was to pretend to be their friend.

Just like [[liberals]] vs. [[conservatives]] the newfags and moralfags want to see a change in ED saying it has become stale and non-threatening whilst the hatefags and oldfags want to see it stay the same before it's flooded with users who like [[anime]] and [[furry|anthro art]] too much.

[[YHBT|The admins and mods sat back and laughed whilst scratching their balls.]]

==The Outcome==

The "war" is still in progress. Some have [[B&|fallen]] and gone back to ranting about how [[fuck]]ing awful ED is in their [[LiveJournal]]s. Some continued their aimless assaults, utilizing an endless stream of [[proxies]] to register new accounts only to be [[banhammer|hammered]] yet again. A scant few realized that they were acting like [[retard]]s and quit, watching from the [[IRC|sidelines]], [[lulz|laughing]] quietly to themselves.

[[The Rapture|In the future]], the remaining members may look back on this and either [[lol]] or [[Delete fucking everything|try to forget the whole fucking thing]]. Some users will turn it into the new [[Godwin's law]]. Others will claim that this is proof you can in fact troll a troll, but this is an attempt to hide their unholy blasphemies by saying, "[[AOL#AOL_Speak|LOLs I wuz only joking guise and joo fell 4 itt!]]" or as they say on [[Meow Wars|Usenet]], [[I did it for the lulz|"Jus trollin guv, honest I was!"]]  "Trolling" people into fucking you up the ass with your own idiocy is not and never will be a form of trolling.  It's just getting fucked up the ass, and at best because you *WANTED* to get fucked up the ass, nothing more than that.

Whether [[you]] think this is [[serious business]] or [[LOL INTERNET|not]] shows what side of this shit-flinging contest you've chosen.

==A Note to All ED Haters==

Is this the end of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]? Not fucking likely.

There are [[Special:Statistics|tens of thousands]] of users at ED. No matter how many are busy fighting each other there will be ten times more hunting for [[lolcows]] and [[drama llama]]s to feed their hunger. The [[16 year old girl|16 year old]] [[tartlets]], the semen-stained [[furfags]] and money-grubbing [[Scientologists]] will not cheer and cry "We've won!" There are plenty of users waiting for them to drop their guard, and drop their guard they will.

== [[Internet Law|Bunker's Law]] ==

A satirist's popularity is inversely proportional to the percentage of people that understand him.

This is based on the observations of Carroll O'Connor, known as famed bigot Archie Bunker on ''All In The Family''. Towards the final days of playing his Archie character, racists and homophobes would walk up to him on the street and thank him for standing up for what they believe in.

This law may be at the root of the cancer that is killing ED.
