'''Bananaphone''' is a song written by Raffi, which became an [[internet]] phenomenon [[Last Thursday|at one point of time]]. It provides a small amount of [[lulz]] followed by a huge amount of hatred for mankind.  

==The Original Song==
[[THEN WHO WAS PHONE|Bananaphone]] was written in 1994 by famous [[unfunny|humorist]] Raffi [[Jack_Kevorkian|Kevorkian]]. Like other [[pedophilia|children's entertainers]] such as [[User:Barney|Barney]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Ouizgzy3M], [[Walt Disney]], and [[Pixar]] [http://www.landoverbaptist.org/news1199/toystory.html] [http://www.landoverbaptist.org/news1101/monsters.html] [http://www.landoverbaptist.org/news1104/incredibles.html], Raffi enjoyed placing various subliminal messages into his songs to corrupt the minds of the youth. In this case, he sang about bananas and ding-dongs (reflecting his [[pig bottom]]edness) and then added some random words and sound effects for good measure.

Like any Raffi song, listening to it causes the need to kill or mortally wound infants. One might say they were [[Dr Kevorkian|better off that way]].

==Bananaphone as an Internet Phenomenon==
Eventually, some [[fat]], [[You Don't Have Any Friends|lonely]] [[basement dweller]] got a hold of this song. Then (clearly intent on spiting the rest of the world for the miserable life he had to live), he increased the song's pitch by 6 semitones, combined it with a [[Azumanga Daioh|shitty meme]] from [[4chan]], and created a [[flash]] video out of it. Other [[basement dweller]]s soon saw this and used it to make more flash videos, combining the song with an [[Badger Badger Badger|even shittier meme]].

The video spread like a destructive wildfire across the [[internets]]. Millions of people got the annoying song stuck in their heads and died horrible, horrible deaths [http://thefriendsociety.com/anim.php?id=bananaphone&w=550&h=400]. The meme forever scarred the already [[insane|fucked up]] [[YTMND]] community, resulted in the complete collapse of the entire [[Vodka|Russian economy]], and caused bloody civil wars in several [[Something Awful|third world countries]].

The video was eventually banned by both the [[United Nations]] and the [[W|U.S. Government]]. Today, even mentioning the flash is considered a [[The Internet Is Serious Business|serious]] felony and can be punishable by [[Internet jail|jail time]] or even [[death]].
