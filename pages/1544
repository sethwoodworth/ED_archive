Once upon a time, Chris Brown had [[The Boondocks|a nigga moment]]. He repeatedly beat Rihanna until she [[Incontinent Student Bodies|baaawed]]. It is a known [[fact]] that Rihanna gave him herpes, or that's what his [[nerd|representative]] claimed. [[Chris Brown]] was said to have [[Jeffery Dahmer|bitten]] Rihanna, so maybe she thought this was all some sort of [[kinky]] game that they were playing. The [[lulz]] about this situation will certainly make for a [[meme]] later in the future.(NOT) <br>
Rihanna, being a stereotypical black person, stayed with [[Chris Brown|Chris]] even though he beat the living shit out of her. I bet Rihanna is singing SOS now.

== Who says you learn from your mistakes? ==
After a long [[Incontinent Student Bodies|bawfest]], Rihanna and [[Chris Brown]] decided to get back together. Why? The reason is [[dumb|unknown]], but it is said that their relationship ended because of [[pools closed|herpes.]]
Then again, a lot of male [[niggers|Negros]] tend to [[domestic violence|hit]] their [[bitch|female companions,]] and then in the end they get back together. It's a cycle of [[lulz]] that keep on rolling.<br>
I mean, some would think that after getting the [[shit]] beaten out of you, you would be pretty pissed at the person and even sue them. I guess Rihanna just likes her men to be dominant and take control of their [[bitch|girl]]. After a long talk with her family, she decided to break up with [[Chris Brown]] and press charges. She [[snitch|testified]] to his asswhipping in front of [[sysop|a court of law]].<br>
[[Chris Brown]] pleaded guilty to a felony assault, and has to do [[internet jail|six months of community service.]] I'm sure that there will be more [[lulz]] and that he will continue to have more nigger moments, therefore ensuring this place as a [[retard|dominant male]] black person. Also, the [[niggers]] at the [[prison|state pen]] will love to [[rape|fuck]] his tight, little ass.

== NEED MOAR PUBLICITY ==
[[everyone|Some]] think that [[Chris Brown]] did not have a black person moment, but instead was looking for [[fantard|publicity]]. Considering how [[retard|retarded]] [[Chris Brown|Chris]] is, I wouldn't doubt this. To get moar publicity, [[Chris Brown]] [[baw|sent out an apology]] via [[jewtube|youtube]].

Next he'll probably make a song about a douche named [[faggot|Makaveli]] and pretend to be dead, thus igniting a huge [[flame war|controversy.]]

After this, Usher, [[Attention whore|needing a lot of publicity]], decided to take this oppurtunity to make a [[Bash|negative comment]] towards [[Chris Brown]] and [[pussy|apologize for it.]]

== He Can't See [[Michael Jackson|The Man in the Mirror]] ==

At the 2010 BET Awards, aka "black person," Chris Brown was to sing and dance like a minstrel to the songs of [[Michael Jackson]]. At first, things seemed to be going off without a hitch, and Brown seemed to be renewing himself for the GOOD things he was known for (something about being a [[Raver|dancer]] and [[Gay|wearing funny clothing]]). Then, when a touch ironic song, [[Rape|Man in the Mirror]] came on the mixtape (which some attribute to a [[IDIFTL|producer making a last-minute change to the line-up]]), [http://tv.gawker.com/5574053/chris-brown-breaks-down-during-shameful-michael-jackson-tribute-at-the-bet-awards Chris broke the fuck down like a bitch] and started [[BAW|BAWing]] live, on-stage, in front of what is essentially the [[LOL|ENTIRE BLACK MUSIC COMMUNITY]]. This would also include, but not limited to, his producers, people who lol'd at him, probably his ex-punching bag Rihanna, most of the Jackson family and kids, and assuming anyone still gave a enough of a fuck about him to still invite him, his inspiration for what he does, [[Bubba|Ike Turner]]. Talk about [[Troll|giving up the ghost]], amirite?

== Rihanna's fourth album ==
Being a typical [[Bitch|woman]] about the matter, Rihanna is releasing an album dedicated to the incident. The track list has been confirmed, but the record company is picking between ''Bitches Get Bruises'' and ''Hoes Get Hit'' for the title.

#''Abuse Me''
#''It Was All My Fault''
#''I Deserved It''
#''Hit Me Baby One More Time''
#:([[Britney Spears]] cover)
#''Sorry I Gave You Herpes''
#''Oh Wait, I Had AIDS Too''
#''Call Me When You're In Prison''
#''When You're Choking Me''
#''Make Me Pass Out''
#''Bye-Bye Cellphone (Hello Beating)''
#''I'll Go Make You a [[Sammich]] Now''
#''[[Whore|Unfaithful]], Part II''
