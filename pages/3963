[[Image:Idlenet.jpeg|right|Description]]

'''[http://www.idlenet.org Idlenet]''' is the [[IRC]] network on which #[[insub]] and #[[1justin]] can be found.

Founded by Encapsulate, Toast, and [[cj_]].

The first server's were insub, gruntle, and evil, and were first linked on 06/20/01. The original name for the network was "WhoreNet", since it was full of dirty whores ([[hepkitten]] and Toast). This was soon changed to Idlenet for obvious reasons (an entire network just for one channel? How lame!). Soon [[hepkitten]] talked to Jej about linking his server (sfrh) to Idlenet and moving a certain uppity IRCchannel over from the blatant instability of [[EFnet]]. 

Shortly after the [[9/11]] attacks, certain members of Idlenet hijacked CNN's closed caption feed and ported it to a specially written perlbot to stream into a moderated [[IRC]] channel for up-to-the-minute [[news]]. Somehow this got [[Slashdot]]ted and before anyone knew it, Idlenet was flooded with news seekers. Some quick shuffling of connections had to be done (what with three of the servers being on DSL lines) and outside brought in popskull to help with the [[bandwidth]] issues. Eventually after a few weeks, things trickled off to a more manageable level, though several channels stayed around. 

Idlenet is always looking to offer new, unique services. The CNN Feedbot is still around in case of national disaster or [[airplane]] building attacks. Perlgott [[cj_]] set up an [[IRC]]-[[AIM]] gateway that allows instant messaging through [[AOL]] via IRC message commands.

==Madcow==
Madcow is a bot that resides on irc at idlenet.org - #insub - Madcow knows all - sees all.

Madcow is love. â™¥

If you want to rapidly annoy the residents of #insub, try asking madcow to look up some definitions. Recommending "madcow urban mdma" and "madcow urban townie" plz. 

==Decline==
Sometime in late April to early May [[2005]], [[hepkitten]] cockteased some [[Latvia]]ns and they launched a [[DDOS]] attack upon Idlenet.

As of 9/21/05, Idlenet is [[dead]].   All servers are in the process of delinking.
