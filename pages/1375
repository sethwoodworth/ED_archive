'''Cata[[otherkin|morph]]<nowiki>ism</nowiki>''' is a [[Wikipedia]] editor/[[lolcow]]/[[sick|gender nazi.]]  '''His''' M.O. is to revamp all dispute discussion into a conversation about his gender.  '''He''' is known for flaring up at anyone who does not acknowledge his claim to be "genderqueer" (more like JEWderqueer, [[amirite]]?) and at anyone who doesn't address him as "singular they".  Generally, people are not inclined to use bad [[grammar]] to [[Hitler|appease]] this douche, but the flaming is usually significant enough to make people lose focus on the article and let '''him''' do whatever they want, because to revert '''him''' without <s>arguing over his gender</s> discussing the changes is a [[ad hominem|personal attack]], lol.

'''His''' gender fanaticism [[fail|cost]] '''him''' adminship[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Catamorphism] and '''he''' [[wikibreak|took an indefinite wikibreak]][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Catamorphism&oldid=66172055], which '''he''' is [[now|currently]] still on.  Had '''his''' adminship succeeded, '''his''' sexual deviance would have qualified '''him''' for the Authorized [http://sonicgivesadviceonrape.ytmnsfw.com/ Anal Rape] branch of dealing with [[vandal]]s.

== Dealing with they ==
If you encounter '''him''' on any dispute, the best way to milk '''him''' for lulz is to constantly refer to Catamorphism as '''he''', '''him''' or '''his''' and completely ignore any attempts '''he''' makes to "correct" you.  This will generally cause the involved editors to erupt in lulz, and will decrease '''his''' chances of becoming an admin.

{{Quote|What I did to Catamorphism, nominating her for [[Bureaucratic fuck|adminship]] when I knew she would be [[attack]]ed visciously and shot down was just my sick idea of fun. I have to admit, I [[Hater|hate]] bull[[dykes]], and I've hated bulldykes ever since I saw them on my [[college]] campus. [[Liberal|They]] told us to be [[Bullshit|tolerant]], but I just can't. There's a certain degree of conformity and decorum that must be maintained. Catamorphism had [[Unrealistic expectations|better change her attitude]] if she wants to get a real [[job]].|[[User:PreciousBodilyFluids|Brian G Crawford]]}}
