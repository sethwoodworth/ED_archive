A '''deep thinker''' is an opinionated windbag with a vast knowledge of idiocies who swirls around the drain of everything he says as if it was worth a damn simply because he ostensibly differs from the majority.  They usually have [[Bullshit|a fascinating array of sputtered verbalizations in this corner on life and society]].  They might be found here and there but some believe their favorite habitat is [[LiveJournal]] in particular and [[Sheep|following around the ol' philosophy professor like an annoying puppy]].


==What They Do==
Deep thinkers will express their ideas to you, and will often go into a shitfit when you tell them they're full of shit and need to [[GTFO]] immediately.  They're the kind of people who will tell you [[Shit nobody cares about|about that convention they went to where they had to live like people in a 3rd world country, and how it's sick that we live in such luxury]].  When they get older, they tend to grow a [[neckbeard|beard]] (hence the nick name "beard-o", or a weirdo with a beard) and make sure it's way too goddamn big, even grooming it so they stand out from the rest of society, including the other depraved jackasses that hang out at IHOP, the deep thinker's usual stomping ground.  They're the ones who also try to explain to you about why we should use [[fascism]] because it's more efficient, or why [[The Lion King]] is horribly [[racist]] because the bad guy is darker than everyone else.  You can tell them that the movie is made for [[children]], and that the bad guy is darker to help them differentiate the protagonists from the antagonists; but they will most likely accuse you of simply not being able to understand what they're talking about.

==[[LiveJournal]]==
Deep thinkers are often found on [[LiveJournal]]. [http://www.livejournal.com/interests.bml?int=deep+thinker] This is only the tip of the iceberg however, as there are thousands more who simply don't show up in a search for "Deep Thinker".

==Slashdot and Digg==
With the advent of [[lies|web2.0]] deep thinkers can be found lurking in the comment sections of [[Digg]] and [[Slashdot]] waiting to condescend and bash your ideas and thoughts. Deep Thinkers often do not care what you are talking about, as long as they get a chance to tediously explain their [[bullshit|opinions]].  The simplest solution to this is never to express an idea, thought or opinion that you genuinely believe, or to avoid web 2.0 in the first place.

==Possible Occupations for a Deep Thinker==
Even though deep thinkers are a useless burden on society, they can often find themselves jobs.  Some occupations include,

# Philosophy Professor: An occupation that takes [[bullshit]] to an art form, a philosophy professor is a perfect job for a deep thinker.  All you need to do is spout off some rhetorical garbage and the drooling morons eat up your every word
# Priest: you can spout even more rhetorical garbage, and even more drooling morons eat up your every word. And they put some money in the basket now and then.
# And uh...
# Hmm
# I guess that's it.
# No, wait, one more: doing... nothing. Yeah, that's it.
# [[????]]

Deep thinkers, like [[Asspie|asspies]] differ from proper nerds precisely because their chosen [[Faggotry|field]] has no real-world practical application whatsoever.
