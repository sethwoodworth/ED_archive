Dice

'''Dice''' refers to any die with more than six sides, because [[RPG|Role-playing nerd]]s are too good for [[Monopoly]] dice. Their best use is as a weapon: hide it in the chip bowl and wait for someone to choke. Very versatile, and you'll have saved the world from another [[Lifetime]] Channel wedding show of [[fat]] brides wearing purple robes and grooms carrying swords.

Everyone knows that the awesomeness of your die is precisely equal to the awesomeness of your [[cock]]. Not only do they show that you are TRULY a [[ripper|hardcore]] gamer, but they roll higher than any mundane plastic die possibly could. Plus, the high-end models do far more damage when hurled directly into your friend's eye!  As such, you MUST throw down [[At_least_100_years_ago|at least $100]] on solid gold dice. Since [[nerds]] don't have girlfriends to waste their [[money]], this does not present a problem.

The most important numbers on a d20 die are the numbers [[oneoneone|1]] and 20.  Rolling a 1 is like projecting your [[IRL|real life]] directly onto your character; i.e. they [[fail]] astronomically at everything. For example, going to open a door and instead decapitating yourself. Roleplaying nerds need to roll die for every action: tying shoes, taking a piss, or deciding which episode of Battlestar Galactica to [[fap]] to.
