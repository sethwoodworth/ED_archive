E-dentity
An '''e-dentity''' is the persona that users of [[LiveJournal]], [[IRC]] and other mass-communication [[Internets]] tools present to others. Because most everyone on the Internets are [[Anthropophobia | anthropophobic]], [[basement-dweller | basement-dwelling]] [[nerd]]s, their e-dentities always portray them as being cooler than they are [[IRL]]. Thus, while a [[16 year old girls | pre-teen]] [[fangirl]] may be timid and acne-riddled in the real world, on the Internets she can craft an e-dentity for herself which portrays her as a beautiful, sexually uninhibited popular kid.

Building a good e-dentity is the first step to becoming [[e-fame|e-famous]]; individuals with particularly interesting or well-crafted e-dentities tend to become [[Internet celebrities]].

If you are not careful, someone can [[Identity theft|steal your e-dentity]].
