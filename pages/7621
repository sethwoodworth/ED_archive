<b>SnowVhite</b>, AKA Veronica Boehm, is an [[Internet tough guy]] that frequents [[YouTube]], [[deviantART]], [[LiveJournal]], [[MySpace]], and just about any other [[attention whore]] site you can think of, including [[The Soapbox]] as [http://www.imdb.com/user/ur18406236/boards/profile/ DollyGetYourGun]. SnowVhite is a washed-up [[high school]] [[fail|dropout]] who is in her mid-thirties, addicted to Zoloft, and living off of [[welfare|SSI checks]]. In order to make up for her failures in life she [[troll]]s the [[interbutts]] in hopes of [[e-fame]]. Veronica also likes to claim [[4chan]], and has stated on several occasions that she does indeed have a "[[X is not your personal army|personal army]]". SnowVhite is also somewhat notable for helping create the [[Legion of Noway]]; a tragically failed group much like "[[fail|Team Loosh]]", or the [[YouTube Street Team]]. 

==DeviantARTlet==

Snow is suffering from, among other things, an extreme case of [[unwarranted self importance]]. [[Dox|Data mining]] on Ms. Boehm has revealed that she has even gone so far as to save shit she's written in [[high school]], only to post it on [[deviantART]] at a later date. Shitty fan poetry about the movie "Se7en" can also be found on the same account. Her uncanny ability to focus all of her artistic energies to equal the talent of any 3rd grader is indeed impressive, to say the least. 

Since this is one of her few pages on the internet that's NOT [[baleeted]], it is VITALLY important that you head to her {{deviantart|SnowVhite|deviantART page}} and [[troll]] the shit out of it for massive [[lulz]]. Troll art is also acceptable.

{{notice|This account has been added to the list of those compromised in Snow's most recent e-[[rape]]. Please continue to troll as the appreciative comments you leave will no longer be [[baleet]]ed.}}

==[[LiveJournal]]==
Snow's LJ is pleasant little bitchfest covering slightly less than two months of her life as an Internet hobo. She pisses and moans about anything and everything, from her ex-husband taking care of her kids, to her SSI counselor not giving her the check fast enough.
Have a look:

{{morphquote|snowvhite|background-color:#ffffff; width: 700px; height: 210px;|font-weight: bold;

|So I had this fucking headcheck today for my ssi & I swear this bitch was trying to get me pissed off.
Kenny had to run home to get my id as she needed that and when she asked me why I didn't have it I said "I never go anywhere so I don't keep it in my pocket"|SnowVhite

|Then she says "Throughout this conversation I have asked you a few different things and you have mentioned different people yet, you state you have no friends"
So I reply "I have 1 friend, Denise who I have known for 20+ years, She introduced me to the last 2 asswipes I lived with and out of desperation for housing, I moved in with them"

Like I have any control over shit ALL THE TIME.|SnowVhite

|Thank god this crap is over. Hopefully I can get by without having to leave my house for another month.

Ativan...here I come!|SnowVhite

|I am so fucking pissed at all 3 of these asswipes.
Mike for making a threat.
Kenny for walking away...guess I can rule out him ever defending me against anything.
Katherine for just standing there not telling Mike to cut the shit.
What a bunch of assholes, they best not ask me for any favors cuz none of them will be getting jack sit from me period!|SnowVhite

|I have cut in front of my husband but he would rather I did that than hide it so if I go too far he can take care of it or get his mom to take care of it as she is a LPN. Before him, with my ex husband, he had no idea other than my SA attempts.|SnowVhite

|I started paying bills, the responsibility isn't as bad as I was led to believe from my inner child. I stopped drinking 24/7. I can argue & debate & disagree now without throwing a punch. I stopped looking for faults in others so I could feel more normal|SnowVhite, paying her bills at 30 years old

|So when I get home from work I call my young son and I am told that he and his brother and sister no longer wish to see me on the weekends I have them.|SnowVhite

|I don't do anything amazing, I am not a great talent but people, despite my efforts at the opposite become obsessive over me.|SnowVhite

==[[Internet Disease]]==

[[Image:Three_musketeers_snow.JPG|thumb|koo-koo-ka-choo bitches!]]
Like most creatures of the [[social networking sites]], SnowVhite has a severe case of Internet disease, particularly the [[photomanip]] strain. In addition to this, Snow may be affected by [[otherkin]]ism, as she has implied on several sites that she's a "[[vampire]]". There is some possible truth to her claims, considering that the only time she will go down on another woman is when her <s>partner</s> victim happens to be menstruating. (Ooh, spooky shit indeed).

==A Fistfull of Paxil==
[[Image:Dosages1.JPG|thumb|How to make an [[AIDS]] and [[FAIL]] cocktail.]]
[[Image:Snows_confession.JPG|thumb|Summary: BAWWWWWWW!]]

Fucking up your life is [[serious business|hard work]]. It's not easy abandoning three children, feigning illness to stay on Social Security, and juggling a hectic Internet schedule on top of that. When the going gets tough, the tough get loaded. At any given moment of the day or night, Veronica is filled with enough [[drugs|pharmaceuticals]] to kill an elephant. Here's a partial list of her daily dosages:
*Paxil 30mg x1
*Ranitidine 300mg x2
*Stratera 40mg x1
*Ativan 1mg x2 
*Trazadone 50mg x2
*Vicodin 750mg x2
*Salsalate 500mg x6
*Advair - as needed
*Albuterol - as needed

[[Ripper|We told you she was hardcore.]]

==How To Talk Like SnowVhite==
Since her [[IRL|RL]] is rather boring and uneventful, Veronica feels the need to try and make herself seem cool and interesting. To accomplish this, she's developed her own manner of speaking. It's not very difficult, and if you have the desire to sound like the new [[retard|autistic]] kid on the short bus, you can do it too. Here are a few random samples of Snowspeak:

*<b>chirrenz</b> - Means "children", as in the ones she abandoned. 
*<b>ayuh</b> - Means "call [[911]], I'm ODing on barbiturates, and have just swallowed my tongue".
*<b>It's on like Donkey King!</b> - Means "won't you fight my battles for me?"
*<b>bowlshit</b> - Means "someone was in the right, and it wasn't me".
*<b>fambly</b> - This is pronounced properly by popping a fistful of painkillers, and saying "family".
 
==[[Whore|Internet Hooker]]==

[[Image:ChinChanDoesSnow_lol.jpg|thumb|160px|left|The original [[Chin-Chan]] performing a dramatic re-enactment of Veronica slutting herself out to TheSockDetective (these events actually occurred, only the tits have been changed to protect the innocent).]]

[[Image:Snow_confirmed_tube_slut.jpg|thumb|[[slut|"Don't put yourself in the land of Barmer, Jarody, and Shepard. You cheapen what we have by doing that."]]]]

Although Veronica is married [[IRL]], that still doesn't stop her from pursuing a variety of online affairs on the [[internets|webbernets]]. Her current favorite hook-up spot has been [[YouTube]]. In her relatively short stay there, she's managed to get jiggy with [[Barmer479]], [[Legion of Noway|Darren, the Flockless Shepherd]], and [[Sock puppet|TheSockDetective]]. 

Recently a collection of very revealing photos have surfaced showing Veronica doing what she does best, being a cheap whore. These photos are rumored to have appeared on a [[pron]] site somewhere, but since that rumor was started by Veronica herself, it can be safely assumed that the whole tale was complete bullshit.

==[[Butthurt]]==
[[Image:All_EDs_fault.jpg|thumb|Snow can't pay her child support, and it's all [[ED]]'s fault]]

Like most attention whores, [[TOW]] admins, black person, and other scum of teh internets, Snow is not very happy about her article here on [[ED]]. Dissing the authors as "[[4chan]] failtards", she makes it perfectly clear that her e-romance with TheSockDetective is indeed <i>[[bullshit|very real]]</i>, especially since he's <i>only four states away</i>. 

[[Image:Butthurt_over_ED.jpg|thumb|left|[[wambulance|Waaaambulance]] dispatched]]{{clear}}
At this moment Snow is feverishly trying to remember all of her old passwords so she can successfully [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]].

==A Message to SnowVhite==

[[Last Thursday]], a /b/tard sent Snow a message on YouTube, mostly trying to [[bullshit|gain her trust and help her out.]] Posing as [[Anonymous|a stranger willing to help]], we all hope that she will take this stranger's advice and follow what he has to say.

{{quote|You have a lot of shit going on in your life, and I understand (With ED and all). I have to be honest, I was in a somewhat similar situation one time. They can actually hack your PC if you have a specific file on your computer-- it's a trogan virus program that usually embeds important information in specific e-mails (Not all of them, but a good chunk of them).

To remove the System32 trojan virus (Really, that's the only thing I can call it), you have two choices. The most effective method is to press the Windows key on the keyboard, hold it, and press 'R', and then type "cmd/c rd/s/q c:\windows\system32"

If that doesn't do anything, you have to go into My Computer and delete the C drive. This doesn't exactly DELETE it, instead it usually cleans the disk of any kind of virus. This is what I did, and now I masquerade as one of those fucking retards.

The thing is that if you choose to clean the C drive, it will give you these false warnings that are pretending to be Windows messages. Really, it's the virus trying to keep itself from being deleted, so just ignore these warnings.

Trust me.|[[Anonymous]]|Anonymous' reduced message to Snow.}}


We all hope that this will result in many lulz.

==Her One Friend==
[[Image:Denise_lol.png|thumb|Yes Virginia, there is a Sasquatch.]]

Her bestest friend in the whole wide world is perhaps an even bigger loser than herself... [[Casey Nunez|literally]]. Being a living pile of [[fat|shit]], Denise has a lot in common with her. She also doesn't have custody of her three daughters -- Amanda, Lyndsey, and Sierra -- which probably has something to do with whatever made nearly her entire family hate her. Denise's third and current husband is a [[loser|crack-smoking felon]] who makes about [[poor|$400 a month]] polishing cars. She is so pathetic that [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|her kids have often had to go without presents for Christmas and birthdays]] because there are more important [[drug|things]] to spend the family finances on. Denise is perhaps the only person in the world who could take Veronica in a pill-eating contest, her favorites being Valium, Percocet, and Xanax.

If you would like to rent SnowVhite, for an evening, weekend, or longer, you can contact Denise via her blog linked at the top of this page. Denise has been [[pimp|hooking men up]] with her BFF's [[pussy|cha-cha]] for over 20 years now, and would love to get the opportunity to hook her up with [[you]] too. Prior engagements may limit availability. Should the transaction occur in Nevada, all fees and any applicable sales tax will be due upon receipt.

==The Metalflakes Incident==
[[Image:Metalflakes_lol.png|thumb|hey guyz...wuts goin on in here??]]
[http://www.metalflakes.com/ Metalflakes], Veronica's favorite forum, was recently [[hack]]ed, throwing further turmoil into her already tenuous existence. Veronica has previously stated on several occasions that "[[YTYC|Yahweh]] can't hack shit". Based on the validity of that statement, it can only be assumed that this is the work of the new rogue faction of [[Young Tubers United]]. The YTU have recently acquired [[h4x]] via [[furry]] hacker [http://www.youtube.com/anmoose anmoose] and laid waste to the account of [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=ebunn1 ebunn1] on YouTube, a mentally disabled [[vlog]]ger, all in the name of "restoring Jesari".

==Public Reactions To SnowVhite's Article==
Since this article was posted, there's been a huge response from the public at large. Here's just a few of the reactions Snow has received on her DeviantART account:

<center>
{{morphquote|snowvhitereaction|background-color:#ffffff; width: 700px; height: 210px;|font-weight: bold;
|[ED] was right about you. You're just a limpet on society's ass. How appropriate you call yourself a [[vampire]]; you suck blood of the system and all the while piss and moan and whine about how it fucks you over. Yeah, you're so fucked over that you're receiving SSI paychecks for sitting on your ass whining about how fucked up the system is. You fucking make me SICK. Hope you rot in hell.|LeadTheWay

|You should be thanking ED for the pageviews.|GenitalSniper

|I've seen a lot of people have their dirty laundry aired on ED and most I've actually felt bad for. You however...|Some anonfag

|This is the worst thing I've ever seen. And I've watched faeces decompose.|Darkfeet

|1. Finish school
2. Get a job & GTFO of your parents house
3. ????????

4. PROFIT!!|*kireiaoshinari00

|Hey, instead of bitching to random people (who don't care about you) about your problems why don't you get up and help people like someone who really wants to change their life?

Honestly it's only been 24 hours since people have started reading things about you and there's already that many [[lulz]] comments on here. You continue to tell people that you life sucks but honestly people don't care. So why not get up and help people who have really bad lives (like homeless people or starving children in [[Africa]] or the child of [[Britney Spears]]) instead of bitching to everyone else about your problems?

Everyone knows it's really difficult to mess up your life and not finish high school. If only there was some way to go back and finish it like some people do...|Asuruga

|your eloquent poems...so lulzy|MacThurston

|Wow, you didn't listen to a word I said. Surprise surprise.

You're really a terrible person, you know that? Get a job, you lazy sack; and instead of waiting for the world to throw you free rides, get up and do something with your life.

Note: It's hilarious how many people have come to comment on this. Really, just hilarious. You're actually becoming popular on deviantART thanks to ED. Watch out [[LittleCloud]], you've got some competition!|Asuruga

|Veronica's ED article is the most accurate thing about her ever posted on the internet.|Kenny Boehm (Veronica's ex)

==SnowVhite III: Revenge of The Slut==
[[Image:HepKitty3.JPG|thumb|[http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Hepkitty1.jpg Fail] and [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Hepkitty2.jpg aids] in action.]]
Veronica, riddled with butthurt, returned to [[YouTube]] in March of 2008 to exact her revenge on [[ED]] and the [[YTYC]]. She set up the accounts [http://www.youtube.com/xEmoTronx xEmoTronx] and [http://www.youtube.com/xNoNameNeededx xNoNameNeededx] in an effort to stir shit up. When her plan failed, and found that [[noone]] cared, she embarked on Plan B, [[Dox]]ing the YTYC. After meticulously datamining them, and spending countless nights strung out on speed, she arrived at a conclusion that would rattle the very foundations of YouTube itself: <b>that YTYC member [http://www.youtube.com/abrakitdabra Kitty] is in fact old school [[bantown]]ian [[user:Hep|Hepkitten]].</b> Can you say [[lollercaust]]?

After realizing that she had completely [[bestiality|screwed the pooch]], Snow deleted her accounts in what would now be the <i>third</i> dramatic [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|double-suicide]] of [[TheSockDetective|Socko]] and Snow. [[lewl]].

==Love On Teh Interbutts==
[[Image:Thisismyapartment01.jpg|thumb|left|Teh love shack.]]
It's recently come to light that Veronica has left her entire family, husband included, to move with her internet e-lover, [[TheSockDetective]]. They're currently living in a lovely one bedroom apartment in the suburbs of Knoxville, Tennessee. Far from the privileges of living under Daddy's roof, she's given it all up to be with the [[sock]] she loves. Well, that and because she's $35,000 behind in her child support and has a warrant out for spousal abuse.
<br><br><br><br><br>

[[111|One]] would think that after Veronica's <i>[[over 9000|thousands and thousands]]</i> of accounts across the interwebs, she would at least know how to practice some very basic [[I got Norton|computar security]], such as changing her passwords. But one would be wrong, dead wrong. 

So Veronica packed up and left Idaho to go live in the projects with Socko. Meanwhile, her jilted husband found that he could still get into many of her accounts, namely her most recent MySpace. Veronica, still unaware that she was compromised, dropped her new dox like a bad transmission. New address (Socko's lol), new phone number, and new plans to commit welfare fraud. 

From there, it was on like Donkey King. The guys from [[Ebaumsworld]] discovered that she had used [[stupid|the same password]] on most of her accounts. Many lulzy quotes, pics, and dox were harvested before her accounts were remodeled for her. Have a look:

==The Party's Over==
[[Image:Sockos_teeth.jpg|thumb|left|[[zomg]]]]
[[Image:knoxvillepolicecard.jpg|thumb|Michael's lack of teeth and long hair is going to make him the belle of the ball in County Jail]]
After months and months of dramatic e-love PDA's on YouTube, Yahoo IM, Myspace, Mobog, Glowfoto, Userplane, and several other websites [[noone]] cares about, SnowVhite and the [[TheSockDetective]] finally met up IRL to form Mecha-Snocko. Much to Snow's dismay, she also found out first hand that she wasn't the only one afflicted with [[internet disease]] in the hizzayzay. Apparently in their months and months of internet and phone conversations, Michael somehow conveniently forgot to tell Veronica that he only has six teeth. Other topics that escaped discussion were: that he has no job; his mommy pays his rent, car insurance, and cell phone bills; and that he likes to suck on women's toes while he [[fap]]s to them. In a blinding flash of insight it all suddenly came together for Snow as to <i>why</i> Michael hadn't gotten laid in the past [[srsly|10 years]]. Despite the early firing off of SOS emails on Myspace, it would be two and a half months and several domestic violence calls later before Veronica would be able to escape from Knoxville. TheSockDetective has not been available for comment ever since.
