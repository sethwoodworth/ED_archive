Mockskin
==Mod Drama Sunday==
[[Image:Mockskin.png|thumb|144px|Mockskin reveals himself. Makes me sick.]]
In the beginning, there was a 7chan mod and [[Perl]] coder named [[Mockskin]]. And for a time, it was good. He coded several little fixes that allowed 7chan to function. It was because of this, that the other mods and users put up with his [[bullshit]]. In an [[NO U|image]] of himself, he is shown as having, long, greasy locks and in the process of growing a [[unix beard]]. By some he was compared to [[Hitler]]. He resided in 7chan's [[IRC]] channel 24/7. This is evidence that he had [[no life]]. 

After quitting the job of being 7chan's equivalent of Coda, he somehow inexplicably held on to his jumped up position of power (both in the IRC channel and the imageboard). This led to him being a complete [[dick]], constantly criticizing everyone and everything. However, we put up with his shit; we put up with his reign of terror. That was until someone stood up to him: Mockskin was publicly terrorised and humiliated by a [[underage|16]] year old boy posing as a bisexual [[azn]] girl on the IRC channel and /b/. 

This [[ChibiQ|revolutionary]] of sorts was /ignored by Mockskin until s/he posted degrading images and chatlogs of him. Mock then went [[apeshit|fucking mental]], deleting posts and banning people on /b/. Drama ensued. He then added the words "mockskin", "mock" and "[[moot]]skin" to the banned word list. Afterwards, he sent an email to admin with a [[an hero|quit]] message. He continued deleting posts critical of him until the mod password was changed. 

We are now free of his tyrannical menacing. On the 29th of October 2006, he quit 7chan following lots of [[drama]] and [[lulz]].
