Animation Source
[[File:Animation source.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''[[myspace|Animation Source]]''', another name for myspace with a furry twist, is a massive online sprawling [[shit|shithole]] that contained the elements of many different animations, which most of the time were dumb as a door nail or had no point what so ever. Ran back in 2004 by a webmaster named Steet, who let the site go all to hell in a hand basket. First starting with a site called DramaSource... erm BaltoSource (also known as BullshitSource) which to which in the present state is famous for people getting ass hurt cause someone's opinion wasn't what theirs was. Back stabbing members, DRAMA! & lots of it, for having the most mind '''sad-bastard-yiff-hating-annoying-as-fuck Balto fans''' you could imagine, and a huge amount of Goth/atheist kidz who liked to cut their selfs in order to feel special. '''Way to go!''' fucktards

(Aka "Street") 
[[Pedophile|Steet]] is the founder of the [[Drama|DramaLand]] sites. He is a [[lazy]] fuck, who doesn't bother to do his job. Instead, he piles all of his responsibilities on his admins and moderators, while he makes more dead sites. It is rumored that he'll make any [[N00b|n00b]] a moderator if they give him a [[Blowjob|BJ]]. 
Whenever there's a problem on the site, he'll run away on a "vacation" just to avoid it. He doesn't want responsibilities, only to rule the internet, as he believes that he, himself is God of the internet.
[[Image:2hquu53.jpg.png|thumb|left|Steet proving how [[horrible|excellent]] of an admin he is.]]


Steet originated from the IcyBoards were he always told everyone on the site that his goal was to create a wesbite known as Balto Source. The administrators of the website, Fluke and Silver Husky, being the douchebags that they are, laughed and told him how pathetic he was. Until then they realized their bigotry that Balto Source was born. That was when Steet starting [[sleeping|meeting]] everyone around the Icy Boards to look for moderation.


Once his monstrosity of a site was born he roamed the wilds of the Balto fandumb looking for victims that would join his shithole site to make it popular with the Balto humpers.  He managed to sucker in several talented artists which in turn suckered in more suckers, till this site became a blackhole of diarrhea.  Drawn to the mediocre Balto arts like flies to shit, every 10 year old future furry had joined the site, which in turn caused the fandumb to implode upon itself.  Shortly after this implosion all the reasonably decent sites closed or died, making Balto Source the bane of all Balto humping faggots.  Balto Source, in short, is the reason the internet sucks.

==The Staff==
The staff or so called big ass moderators, think they are the top of their game considering they are the fucking color green or orange. They are a elite group of Nazi's who push around and manipulate anyone they see fight. This site has since fired over half of it's staff members since some couldn't get along & tried to take each other out in order to gain more control then they already had. Now now if you talk to the staff all off the time won't get a damn thing done, they all like to boss everyone around rather than do their damn jobs, and when they do get off their lazy asses they manage to make the problems worse.

Guess what? Now ANYONE can become a moderator!! All you have to do is ask, even though its against the rules! If Street, or the admins say "no", just throw a huge fucking tantrum, and threaten to leave the site. Since they're so desperate to become the most popular site on the internet, they can't afford to loose members, so they'll give you whatever you want!

==Members==
[[image:Wowc3.jpg|thumb|common shitty Blaot fanart]]
'''''(also known as BSers, BaltoSourcers, Bullshitters)''''' With the members of this shit palace you'll get a occasional welcome then you could say HIII!! and they would be on your ass for it. for spamming their precious Shoutbox which does nothing but create more problems for everyone else. The members here think they are the gods of the internet since they can so call "mini mod" and say NO SMS!! and the staff lets it go by, without saying a damn thing. what the hell?? 
[[image:Mmmmmmmtasty8D.png|thumb|left|TASTES LIEK [[penis|Chicken]] ]]
The members are usually whiny bitches, who have to fucking complain '''WHENEVER A NEW RULE IS ADDED.''' They'll start bitching, and cause huge flame wars on the site, until they get what they want. Most of the members are retarded imbred childen, pissy teens, or perverted adults. Some of the members like to use DramaSource like a DATING SITE (srsly, WTF???) 
The Queen of the DramaSource sites is [[C4tspajamas|CatWhoHas14Tails]] since all the members will gladly lick her [[Vagina|pussy]] because they love her [[Shitpile|art]].
Lets not forgot that the members also lack creativity, and will commonly fight among themselves about [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Shit nobody cares about]].

And to be a "popular Member" all you have to do is : Wolf/Doggie art! Thats right! Look at many artists, [[bitch|Catwhohas14tails]], [[Dyke|Zukothecat]], [[Emo|Hecate]],[[Whore|SilverDeni]] all do doggie art, and get INSTAAAA LOOOOVE.

==The Source Sites==
[[File:Girls_fashion_source.jpg|thumb|wow Steet.... wow]]
[[File:ANOTHER_ONE.jpg|thumb|right| oh God... ANOTHER ONE? plz troll]][[File:Lol_fail.PNG|thumb| Lol just another dead, useless site that no one gives a crying fuck about]]

DramaSource has been the most famous for having the most dead sites on the internet, and creating a new damn site for every movie imaginable. the so called staff can suggest a '''Alice In Wonderland''' source for girls & it would be up the same damn day no members but another dead ass site that no one pays attention to, and can be a another place for the members to start shit on each other, what a great idea Street!
It has been made so that you can own your own DramaSource (not like there's already enough, amirite? nope. they need MOAR). All you have to do is ask Street, and he'll make one for you because he doesn't have the ballz to say no to his precious members
lets list all the sites, shall we?
*Balto Source
*The Lion King Source
*TaleSpin Source
*Princess & the Frog Source
*All Dogs Go to Heaven Source
*Spirit Source
*Lady and the Tramp Source
*Robin Hood Source
*Mulan Source

Isn't it funny how all but BaltoSource seems to be dead?





==Rules to the sites==
even though no one seems follow them, and you can basically get away with anything, other than having "mini-mods" all over your ass. Then again... since anyone can make up their own rules, it doesn't really matter.
*NO Swearing!!! ITS A KID FRIENDLY SIGHT! 
*NO Double posting!!! EVEN THOUGH COMPUTERS MAY LAG SOMETIMES, AND DOUBLE POST ON ITS OWN, ITS STILL AGAINST THE RULES. This equals an instant ban
*No offensive icons or signatures!! ''Posting offensive shit on the ShoutBox, your profile, and other member profiles is perfectly acceptable though''
*No animations!! Animations are a big no-no
*NO TYPING IN ALL CAPS!! ITS CONSIDERED SPAM!! (do it for the lulz)
*NO SMS!! Its hard to read. since no one on this site knows what "lol" means, you're not allowed to use it, or its an '''instant ban!'''
*NO short answers! you can't say "good job!" or "i like it!" or "this sucks!" (ect.) as a reply to anything. If not followed, then ''INSTA BAN''
*NO Off topics! you're not allowed to change the topic, or instant ban (I'm tired of saying this)
*NO Moderators!! no asking to be a moderator!! (lol, this doesn't count as a rules anymore, since anyone can become a mod, amirite?)
*NO MAETS!!!
*NO PORNO'S
*NO Steeleing!! (its funny how they'll allow you to color over a screenshot. Isn't that stealing? LOL [[Hypocrites|HYPOCRITES]]
