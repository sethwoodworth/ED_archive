Retro
[[Image:Hiphipyuck.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Degenerates on display]]
'''Retro''' is an [[Ad Nauseum|irritating]] non-sexual fantasy found [[AIDS|epidemic]]ally in fashion, [[music]], architecture, and human behavior, in which reproducing an imaginary, glorified model of how [[life]] supposedly was in the past is perceived as better than creating something new. It is distinct from [[Nostalgia]], which is merely an [[infantilism|infantile]] and neurotic inability to let go of one’s own shitty experiences that somehow seem better than life in the present day. Almost always, a Retro approach to a particular aspect of culture is something imposed by corporations and [[media]] conglomerates, while nostalgia has more to do with one’s own personal [[Asperger's syndrome|psychological problems]]. It is made to seem [[Pretty cool guy|cool]] through using [[irony|ironic]] humor to both make fun of and get all weepy about the shitty way things used to be.

==The good old days==

For example, [[white people]] who grew up in the [[United States]] during the 1950s remember it as an incredibly boring time, bloated with idiotic rules and restrictions, in which it was impossible to have any fun whatsoever without [[suspended|being marched straight to the Principal’s office]]. ([[Negro|Negroes]] and other [[Mexicans|colored people]] have no history, so it is unknown how their lives were.) Nevertheless, twenty years later, the international [[Jews|Jewish]] media bosses realized that they could make a killing by pushing the 1950s as an [[Lolicon|innocent]] time of teenage fun and hi-jinks.

Sure enough, young people began to go all out in mimicking the attitudes and fashions of “Happy Days,” “American Graffiti,” and other Jew retro perspectives on a time gone by. Meanwhile, parents were also caught in their psychotic nostalgia, realizing the total inaccuracy of the retro portrayals, yet thinking back fondly of those times. A later version of this problem came with the popular but similarly inaccurate “That ‘70s Show.”

==A long and sordid history==

Retro crazes have been pervasive throughout human history. Many [[fascist]] revolutions have been launched with the goal of restoring the nation to the way it was in a mythical “Golden Age.” Adolf [[Hitler]]’s national fantasy was a rather artistic variation on this theme.  Imagine a pure race of strong [[men]] and fertile [[women]], living in their rustic farmhouses and massive neo-classical buildings, wearing cute matching outfits, worshipping [[Cthulhu|heathen Nordic gods]], going hiking in the Alps, eating [[penis|sausages]]. To bring back this happy era, it might have to get a little messy first. You there! [[Holocaust|Into the oven.]] Hop-la. There you go.

==Hippie Dipshits==
[[Image:Samurai Pizza Cats.gif|thumb|Retro enthusiasts are STILL concerned that this was a "BLATANT RIPOFF" of [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES]]!]]
Another example is that of the [[Hippies]]. Everyone knows that the hippies of the late 1960s and early 1970s were some of the '''L'''aziest, '''S'''tupidest and '''D'''irtiest people to walk the earth since Neanderthal (and that might be insulting to the Neanderthal). Unfortunately, unlike the Neanderthal, hippies haven't been wiped out by their far superior relatives --- the human race. Most hippies were violent, semi-retarded and often criminally insane. Older hippies who are still alive can usually be seen begging for a dollar at the corner liquor store. Yet again and again, the hippie lifestyle and aesthetic of the “Summer of Love” is promoted as a beautiful time of peace and love, health and freedom – the opposite of what it really was. Year after year, a teeming new cohort of dirt-children makes the Haight-Ashbury scene, looking for some free love, [[drugs|get high, babie]], flower-power, vegans-but-smoke-cigarettes, share some lice, spread the ringworm, try some scabies. The insipid rock music of the hippie days yet again can be heard whining from the windows of high-pollution old Volkswagens.

==If music be the food of love, turn it the fuck off and get a job==

Why is it that the cheeziest pop music of 40, 30, 20 years ago can '''constantly''' be heard in the second-hand emissions of one’s fellow subway-travelers’ iPods? Why is every new generation of young people "re-discovering" the pop tunes that drove you fucking nuts back when you were much younger? You have to ask yourself: Who is getting paid? Answer: <strike>Italians</strike> Jews.

On the other hand, why '''won’t''' they release the 1970s video archives of [[:Image:Soultrain.JPG|Soul Train, with host Don Cornelius?]] WHAT ARE THEY HIDING?

Retro is a phony aesthetic that is packaged, promoted and sold to the gullible, insecure consumers of a later time.
