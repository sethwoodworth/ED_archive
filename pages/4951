It all began [[Last Thursday]], when officials revealed the hip new [[London]] 2012 Olympics logo to the public. This new logo was supposed to be [[ghetto|urban]], [[awesome]], [[wut|active]] and [[extreme]]; however, it turned out to be one of the most ghastly sights since the public broadcast of Janet Jackson's nipple piercing. The cost of this logo to British taxpayers was a whopping [[over 9000|£400,000]] (about $604,000). Yes, it cost '''that''' much for someone to draw two simple, ugly geometric figures with a pair of highlighters.

The public's reaction was nothing short of outrage, and the logo was described as "a broken swastika" [http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/sterlingtimes/vpost?id=1940575&trail=15#3]. It's amazing how the campaign was so bad that it's brought back nightmares of [[Godwin's law|World War 2]] and the [[Holocaust]]. In fact, careful examination of the design will invariably reveal its resemblance to two people having [[buttsecks]]. You see it now!

None of the British public like it. A [[13 year old boy]] could've done better for a fiver!

==Animated Epilepsy Version==
As though the standard logo wasn't bad enough, the official website also featured a [[flash]] animation of the logo in action. The animated version involving a diver flashed so rapidly that it caused epileptic fits across Britain, exactly what [[Pokemon]] did to [[Japan]] and the [[Scientology|Church of Scientology]] did to the [[Epilepsy Foundation]]. The offending animation was removed from the site, but a segment of the animation has been preserved on ED for those who are still interested in what it feels like to have a [[AIDS|seizure]].

==Fan-Created Designs==
Due to increasing [[crybaby|outrage]] over this logo, many different fan versions of the logo have been submitted to the main site and others. Most of them were equally shitty and full of [[fail]]; however, there was '''one''' design that stood out among the others:

[[Image:2012goat.jpg|center|The superior logo that made its way to the [[BBC]].]]

Yes, someone was smart enough to implement the iconic [[Goatse]] design in their submission, creating one of the greatest and most [[lulz]]worthy logos ever made. [http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=bb0_1181036190 This design even made it on to live television.] The person who submitted this was a poster on the British imageboard [[B3ta]].

==[[A Challenger Appears]]: Chicago 2016!...oh shit, it's Rio 2016==

President Obama, his wife and Oprah Winfrey spent quite a lot of time in Copenhagen, [[buttsecks|petitioning]] for Chicago to be the location for the 2016 games. Obama feels that Greece and England shouldn't have all the fun by keeping graft and waste-ridden athletic competitions to themselves, and needs to feed his ego by being a president who personally brings Olympic games to the USA. Obama was pressured by Oprah and his homies back on the street to get the games so they could get all that IOC money to dress up parts of the ghetto. That is tear down some housing projects, throwing some poor niggers on the street to build a state of the art Olympic village for the athletes. Construct more overpriced venues so they can overcharge the IOC to build facilities with low standard materials, and cheap labor so they can pocket the difference. After the games are over let the facilities become abandoned and fall to ruin to be overrun by the same squatters they through out on the street 4 years prior.

If Chicago had hosted the games, new logos and the city's storied tradition of political crony-ism and corruption would surely have generated enormous lulz. But Obama and his wife decided that he was so amazing with the Nigra Powers that they only gave 20 minutes speeches after a crappy video about how great Chicago is. Then again they both probably knew their beloved city did not stand a chance to Rio. Rio has things that Chicago didn't, Hot Beaches, Hot naked girls, titties and Hot underage naked girls, which won over the crown in Copenhagen, the CP capital of Europe. All Chicago has is Lake Michigan with fat slobs laying of the beach.

Alas, Chicago was voted out on the first round. There goes the chance that Chicagoan Marc Griffin's High Caliber Table Game, [[Bulletball]], would become an Olympic Sport. However, Rio does have shantytown slums, beaches, [[whores|hot bitches]] and a child prostitution network that even [[ACORN]] would evny. This raises Pedobear's hopes that Bangkok, Thailand will one day host the games. With Fox news and Obama's Conservative opponents voicing concerns of President Obama's crony corruption, and a video of a kid being beaten to death in that fine city. With these corruption and safety concerns the IOC decided to give the 2016 games to Rio a city just as run down and corrupt and crime ridden a chance to suck on the International money tits. So now Rio can tear down the favela's, throwing niggers out on the street, to build an Olympic village and facilities that will be abandoned after use, to fall to ruin and be overrun by he same squatters they through out 4 years prior. They are already well on their way with creating a shitty logo that is being blamed for plagiarism.
