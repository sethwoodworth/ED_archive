Social journal

A blogging site that ran the [[LiveJournal]] software, SocialJournal went offline in early January of 2005.

While the site's demise would have upset its emotionally unstable users anyway, the damage was only compounded by the suddenness of the shutdown and users' inability to receive a copy of their precious writings.

On their farewell page, the former operators of SocialJournal advised users to go use [[LJ]] with the now heart-rendingly ironic assurance that "they have been around for years, and they will not be going [[Russia|offline]]."
