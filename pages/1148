Bravestar
[[Image:Bravestarr3030.jpg|frame||left|Yeeee haww, wanna [[yiff]]?]] {{clear}}

A cartoon about a dirty [[Mexican]] lawman set in the Wild West, in space!
Notable for featuring an anthro [[horse]] called Thirty/Thirty as BraveStarr's sidekick/mount/hole, as well as many other [[furry]] characters.
The villain, Tex Hex, rides a [[horse]] that can turn into a jet-powered hovercraft, [[WTF]]?

One of the many cartoons of the 1980s that may have spawned a generation of furries, BraveStarr had poor animation and ran for only one season. A feature-length movie and various merchandise including a [[video game]] were also released by greedy network [[jews]] to suck money from children.
These days it is an epic source of nostalgic lulz simply due to the large quantities of [[furfaggotry]] involved.


==Cast==

===Bravestarr===

The main character.  A hero, lawman, and thrown bone to the minority population.  Along with his neat hat and spot-on Billy Jack impersonation, Bravestarr had the ability to copy the powers of a handful of animals.  This included the strength of a [[gay|bear]], speed of a puma, throwing skills of a girl, and [[penis|wang]] of a horse.  He had to rely on these fruity powers because, like other cartoon heroes of his time, Bravestarr's gun was fucking useless.

===Thirty/Thirty===

A robot horse.

===That's it===

If someone tells you that there was anybody else in this show, call them a liar and don't listen to whatever they say.
