'''Marry Your Favorite Character Online''' is perhaps one of the biggest piles of [[fail]] on the [[internet]]s, not just because of its [[stupid]] concept to allow [[16-year-old girls]] and [[13-year-old boys]] to [[sex|get freaky]] with fictional characters, but because there is little to no moderation AT ALL.  This means the [[fangirls]] using the site are allowed to submit [[over 9000|over 90000000]] different profiles of Johnny Depp without being told that THERE ALREADY IS ONE, [[retard|RETARDS]].  But, on the bright side, the lack of moderation also makes MYFCO a great place to [[troll]].

Essentially, this website is one of the biggest examples (outside the [[furry fandom]] that is) that  [[Rule 34]] is valid on the interwebs.  If it exists, there is someone on MYFCO married to it. No exceptions.

== How it "works" ==
1. [[Fanboy]]/[[fangirl]]  is [[obsessed]] with an actor, singer, or (more likely) a [[cartoon]] character like [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] or [[Rangerphile|Chip and Dale from Rescue Rangers]]. 

2. He/she wants to marry him/her, but can't due to consistent [[fursecution]] from the [[the man|powers that be]].

3. [http://www.myfconline.com/boards/index.php?do=view&type=messages&master_id=3151 He/she cuts herself/himself], goes to MYFCO, and looks for their character.  

4a. If their show and character is there, they can "marry" the character.

4b. If not, they can submit the character, or even their own [[fursona]] for supreme wankery.

This is how it SHOULD go. But of course, the idiotic teenage members of the site submit the same show over and over again, usually adding unnecessary punctuation and [[emoticons]]. Yes, [[Naruto]] is there, with proper capitalization, but there's also [[all caps|NARUTO]], [[emoticon|nArUtO^______^]], and [[leet||\|4rut0]]. And then there's the people who submit categories like "OMG THESE GUYZ ARE HAWT", filled with characters that already have a proper show, causing [[butthurt]] bureaucrats to whine for [[at least 100]] years. 
The [[16-year-old girls]] are prime [[lulz]], but the truly alarming thing about the site is that you can marry even the [[Lolicon|youngest characters]] on any given show. So they're not only enabling psychos now, but [[pedo]]s. [[GG]] MYFCO!

Users there can't deal with [[trolls]] very well, as seen [http://www.myfconline.com/boards/?do=view&type=messages&master_id=4982 here] and [http://www.myfconline.com/boards/?do=view&type=messages&master_id=5180 here]. Most of the time they flock together in a thread and make empty threats, or claim to grow [[otherkin|demon armor]] to "[[retard|FIHGT TEH EVUL!11!]]" This usually brings many [[lulz]].

==The Great [[i/|/i/]] Raid of April 9th, 2007==
The [[i/|/i/nfidels]] conducted a full-on assault of this netslum complete with [[longcat]], [[mudkip]]s, [[porn]], and [[moar]]. Epic [[lulz]] were had by all.

In conducting the raid, an unsavory cross section of the open internets was unearthed. Users such as [http://www.myfconline.com/Paper_Hearted_Samurai Paper_Hearted_Samurai] represent this group adequately. Her behavior in the spewbox on MYFCO's main page can be summed up as follows:
#Whine, cry, and hurl [[retarded]] threats at [[Anonymous]].
#After realizing that winning against [[Anonymous]] is futile, this [[weeaboo]] attempts to go sheep and [[troll]] herself.
#Since [[Anonymous]] does not forgive, nor forget, user is [[pwned]] until they [[GTFO]] the internets.

Feel free to troll her on [http://profile.imeem.com/YvHqyJ this site] and at seppukusamurai@hotmail.com.
