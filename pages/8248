'''''The Internet Is Serious Business''''' is a phrase used to remind those who have just been successfully trolled that being mocked on the [[Internet]] is, in fact, the end of the world.  Common variations include, '''Internet... Serious Fucking Business''', '''The Internet: Serious Business''', '''Internet = Srs Business''', '''SRS BIZNS''' and even just '''INTERNET!!'''  Plural: '''The Internets Are Serious Businesses'''.

The phrase is often used as the text of an [[image macro]] or to highlight the [[Stupidity|complexity]] of a [[flame war|heated debate]] in an internet [[forum]].

[[Jameth|James Robert Murphy]], 38, of Columbia, South Carolina, was sentenced to 5 years of probation, 500 hours of community service, and more than $12,000 in restitution for two counts of [[Trolling|Use of a Telecommunications Device (the internet) with Intent to Annoy, Abuse, Threaten or Harass]].

Murphy was indicted in April 2004, for [[trolling IRL|sending harassing emails]] to [[Seattle]] resident Joelle Ligon and to other employees of the City of Seattle. He pleaded guilty to two counts in June 2004. [[internet court|In sentencing Murphy]], [[tl;dr|U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Zilly]] told Murphy he "[[I did it for the lulz|...did not demonstrate the type of remorse he should under the circumstances]]."

'''In The Summer Of 2005''', the internets was taken by storm by the serious business event known simply as '''"[[YOU FUCKING STOLE MY CLOUDSONG]]"'''.  This was an event in the game "Dark Age Of Camelot" where some nerd made numerous [[internet tough guy|death-threats]] against a party of people who stole his rare item, a "Cloudsong".  Was made popular by [[DeviantArt]], but was mislabelled as "''[[World of Warcraft|WOW]] is serious business''".

'''On January 14, 2006''', a new lawsuit came about when a "man" [http://www.courttv.com/news/2006/0112/chatroom_suit_ctv.html sued his internet buddies after he was made fun of in a chatroom.] This is an excellent example that the internet is still SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS.

'''In July, 2007''', US Navy Petty Officer Russell Tavares was sentenced to seven years in prison [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19980505/ for driving 1,300 miles to burn down the trailer owned by someone who called him a "nerd" on the internets].  SERIOUS BUSINESS INDEED!

Another example is Tracy Williams, a college lecturer who used a Yahoo group as a base for repeatedly hassling one Michael Keith Smith (a member of the [[Douche|UK Independence Party]]), discussing the Iraq War. He ended up suing her and [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/4829932.stm winning £10,000], though whether or not this had something to do with Tracy's flagrant breaches of [[Godwin%27s_Law|Godwin's Law]] remains unreported. Tracy obviously grossly underestimated the seriousness of the business in which she was engaging (or something). Likely originated on the [http://www.genmay.com/ General Mayhem] forums.
