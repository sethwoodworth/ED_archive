'''Bandwidth envy''' is a condition triggered by your fellow [[basement dweller]]s' bragging about their [[Atheist|ungodly]] amounts of bandwidth for downloading [[furry]] [[porn]]. This can result in an unhealthy [[lust]] for your neighbor's internet speed, especially when you think it could solve your [[life]]'s biggest problems (admittedly, most of which probably involve an insufficient supply of porn). The amount of bandwidth one has is generally proportional to their [[nerd|e-peen]], but inversely proportional to the amount of sex they have.

==History==
Bandwith Envy started in the mid 90's. At the time dial-up modems were the only option and people with cable modems were few and far between, later the cable connections became available and thus the start of bandwith envy. Asking any player on an online game would forever claim to [[lie|have a T1 connection]]. Players that were clearly connected at 56k would claim to have girlfriends in their house downloading terrabites of MP3 files slowing down their T1 connection. In reality these people were attempting to play [[Counter Strike]] via dial-up connection to AOL.

[[Normal]] men and women suffer from have [[penis envy]], but since [[penis]] size only matters if you're capable of attracting an [[IRL|actual]] sex partner, pipe size becomes a substitute for cock size.

===Decline===
Due to practically every man and his dog having a fast internet connection outside of [[Africa]] and [[Australia]], the amount of bandwidth one has is now almost redundant. To improve latency in online gaming, the speed of one's rig, and the quality of networking in the household has become a major factor.
