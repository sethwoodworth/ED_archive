'''LoveBugz.Net''' is a website dedicated to the love of having tiny little [[AIDS| parasites]] [[wtf| living and fucking]] in your pubes.
You have to be a [[faggot| friend]] of the owner of the website to gain access to his forums, and to even be able to get the maggots, you need to [[sex| fuck the guy]].

==What the fuck is this shit?==
Apparently, on the FAQ, it states that "[[bullshit| A japanese bug scientist bred them special. Into like domesticated social insects. Over a whole lot of generations, he picked out the largest and tamest bugs and bred those for the next generation. Just like a cool dog, after a thousand generations you get a beast that's really friendly.]]"

That's right. They were bred by an [[AZN]] for your pube-itching pleasure. But not only is it completely normal to have lice on you, it's also a fantastic feeling on your scrotum. They don't bite, but [[Gross| they do eat the dead skin cells off of you]]. [[Hippie|It's natural]]!
