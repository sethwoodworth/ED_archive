'''LOST''' is an [[Shit|award-winning]] show about a bunch of whiny [[fucktards]] stuck on an island in the [[internets]] written by several [[Star Wars]] [[fanboi]]s. The only lulzworthy character in this show is [[John Locke]]. Mainly, it's Gilligan's Island with moar [[drama]], moar [[fucktards]] and no [[unfunny|funny.]] The show should be renamed The [[John Locke]] Hour because the only reason people watch the show is to see him fuck up shit [[for the lulz]]. 

It's a huge success online, due to the fact that the main characters include a [http://lostpedia.com/wiki/Hurley fat underachiever], a [http://lostpedia.com/wiki/Locke genuine fruit loop], and a [http://lostpedia.com/wiki/Jack cunt who thinks that he's always right]. The fact that the writers introduce a [[retarded]] twist in '''every''' episode is viewed as a redeeming quality amongst fans of low-quality [[drama]].
The show has a huge following among [[basement dwellers]].<br>

Due to the fact that many [[gay]] and/or [[retarded]] people who spend way too much time on the [[internets]] identify with the show, it has become an [[old meme]] in record time. One of its unifying themes centers around crying.

==How to make a retarded tv show==

The lost producers, Jew and friends pulled off an interesting stunt. He and his idiot friends got around their three-foot graffix water bong and came up with a concept of an island inhabited by some hippies who do goofy science shit, or something. Being the mid 2000s and nothing else on TV was all that great, ABC gave it the greenlight and pretty soon they were writing a show. However, they ran out of ideas so they decided to take a cue from the Airport series. Much like Airport 1977 "The Long Version" (shown on TBS every 3 weeks), they decided to include flashbacks of every single character from every god damn phase of life. They did this until the producers could browse enough internet forums to find the coolest, wackiest plot ideas their viewers could come up with. The best idea won and was then integrated into the script. They kept this up for years until the ending which they drew up on an Ether binge, the end.

==The Characters==

SPOILER ALERT: EVERYONE IS DEAD

*<b>Jack</b>: Whiny bitch and possible [[skinhead]]. Although he is a surgeon, he has so far botched every  operation. He married the only survivor of his medical skillz, who in turn cheated on him because he doesn't have a penis. On the island, he has continued his tradition of crying about not being able to "save everyone". We know, Jack, we know. [[John Locke]] pwns Jack in every possible way. Only faggots and some girls think Jack is the main character instead of Locke. Has a sister asking for some [[incest]] on the island (you know what to do, Jack). Also at the very end of the show he dies after killing the smoke monster. Good job [[retard]]. <B>DEAD</B>

*<b>Kate</b>: A wanted criminal and an emotional bitch with [[Canada|beaver]] teeth who [[rape|can't make up her mind]]. Later in the series she gets in Sawyer's panties.  Main purpose on the show is to cause [[angst]] and get kidnapped by Others, but now agrees that Jack is as [[crazy]] as [[John Locke]] for thinking it's his destiny to [[Intellectual_Checkmate|destroy]] the island. Otherwise, Kate is there to stand around and yell at Jack for [[doing it wrong]] and fucking her favorite boytoys.  She even took part in a ten on one [[gangbang]] in a deleted scene.<B>DEAD</B>

*<b>Sawyer</b>: [[Redneck]]. Enjoys eating polar bear food and has a porn collection somewhere. Actual name is James. He picked the name Sawyer because that was the name of the man who molested and killed his mommy and daddy. Makes up nicknames for people on the island and trolls people's inherent character flaws for the lulz. Like Jack, he refuses to grow a full beard. Jumped out of a rescue helicopter because there was too much extra weight on it, rather than throw that fat turd Hurley out like a real man. Ends up fucking Juliet, Kate and Ana Lucia AKA every girl Jack wants to fuck. High-fives all around. Also fucks [[ginger|Charlotte]] in ghost epilogue, although she looked like a ghost while alive.<B>DEAD</B>

*<b>[[John Locke|Locke]]</b>: Bad ass [[skinhead]] box worker who likes going [[ICP|chicken hunting]] and he will [[John Locke|fuck your shit up]]! Only purpose on the show is to cause [[lulz]] by killing a main character every three episodes. Tried to [[emo|kill himself]] because he saw his pathetic life had no meaning, but later changed his mind and Ben finished the job. Dead but <s>will</s> <s>return(ed)</s> RRRESPAWN! after fucking up enough shit in hell. Allowed [[Satan]] to take over his body so they could wreck shit as one entity. Or, more likely, he was Satan all along. <B>DIED 3 or 4 times who really gives a shit, he's still fucking shit up.</b>

*<b>Hurley</b>: [[Fat]] [[Mexico|Mexican]] also known as Hugo, who won the lottery after working in an empanadas store. He then proceeded to burn his house down and break his mother's leg. Then he turned himself in to a mental institution. Since then he has moved on to more productive things, like sneaking around eating tubs of ranch dressing and crying about being [[fat]]. Holds a guitar case, not yet revealed, but it's obviously full of [[fat fuck]] food.  Later it was revealed to be a [[gay|wooden Egyptian symbol]], which Hurley ate because he's a fatass. [[lolwut|He also becomes the new Jacob]] <B>DEAD</B> probably after taking a number 1 on his number 2.

*<b>[[An hero|Michael]]</b>: [[Nigra]]. Known for stealing watches and watermelon. Also <s>yells for</s> abandoning his son in typical [[Child Abuse|black fashion]]. Left the island after his stash of KFC was blown up by Locke. Only line in the whole series was [[LINK MAH BOIIIII|"MAH BOI!!!"]], repeated [[over 9000]] times an episode. <s>Recently returned to the island, believably, as a black person.</s> <B>DEAD LOL</B>.  He became a black person as soon as he left the Island. Didn't go to heaven because he's black.

*<b>Walt</b>: Is actually Walt [[Disney]], but came back as a black person, and does creepy shit like kill Shannon, which is a good thing. [[John Locke]] [[Stalker|stalks]] him so he can be the world's craziest wheelchair [[pedophile]]. Basically has nothing else to do but tell his father to [[gtfo]] because he told Walt he killed two [[women]] as the actors were due to be killed off because they got [[arrested|raped]]. <B> DEADER </B>

*<b>Mr. Eko</b>: An [[African]] heroin-transporting priest who encourages Charlie to build a <s>church</s> KFC on the island. One of the few characters that was actually cool, but inevitably killed simply because he's a [[nigra]]. He's killed by a random, [[black]] smog monster (possibly out of <s>someone's</s> Locke's ass). <B>DEAD</B> SPOILER ALERT: EVERYONE IS DEAD

*<b>Jin and Sun</b>: <s>[[Azn]]s. Jin was a hitman for Mr. Roboto, aka Suns father. Meanwhile, Sun was banging a penis headed businessman who throws himself out a window after having sex with Sun because he doesn't want to be a father. MAJOR OMG TWIST UPDATE: Jin is now alive even though he trusted a black person to defuse a bomb rather than set it off, and saved himself from becoming another [[racist]] death, which would have added more [[lulz]].</s> <B>LOL SUB DEATH</B>

*<b>Lapidus</b>: The main character of the show.  An [[alcoholic|alcoholic]] pilot with [[over 9000|over 9000]] feet of chest hair.  He personally blew up the Ferarri on [[Grand Theft Auto|Miami Vice]].  <s>Will more than likely be the Canidate who replaces [[God|Jacob]].</s> <s>Killed off-screen by a door.</s> Makes a comeback in the finale where he trolls Richard and Miles into fixing a plane for him after they save him. Believed by many to be the younger brother of [[Epic Beard Man|Epic Beard Man]]. Crashed plane shortly after leaving island;<B> DEAD </B>

*<b>Keamy</b>: A [[Internet Tough Guy|ruthless]] mercenary who shoots [[16 year old girl|Alex]] and [[pretty cool guy|doesn't afraid of anything]].  Led a mission to capture [[Josef Fritzl|Ben]] because he is the only person even remotely as creepy as him.  He makes great [[Bacon and eggs|eggs]].

*<b>[[asshole|Boone]]</b>: Locke's bitch. Tries too hard to become a main character on the show and gets himself killed while trying to steal a stash of [[drug|heroin]] from a crashed airplane. Actually fucked his [[Incest|sister]] Before crashing on the island and was a gay [[porn]] star specializing in German scheisse (scat) videos on the [[interwebs]]. <B>DEAD</B>

*<b>Charlie</b>: Pronounced "Chah-ley". Heroin addict, brainwashed Mr. Eko follower, and bassist in the fictional band [[cock|Driveshaft]]. All he ever does is redeem himself and try to drown Claire's BAAAEE-BEEEEE!!!!. Fucks Jack's sister Clair. While completely stoned, he hears that Frodo Baggins is in a secret underwater base and goes down to save him. Drowns in the process after realizing it's too late and that Hobbits <i>can't swim</i>. <B>DEAD</B>

*<b>[[bitch|Claire]]</b>: Mocked constantly for having a ridiculously nasely voice, always whining about CHAAAARHHHLLIEEEE!!!! and bitching about her BAAAEE-BEEEEE!!!!, Aaron, aka [[penis|Turnip Head]]. She is in fact the only Australian on a flight originating from Australia. <s>She's dead or a ghost or some shit like that</s> recently reappeared, as she enjoyed her former [[emo]] life in the dark rape cabin with her father.  She is now the second coming of the French jungle bitch, and also [[fat|fat]]. <B> DEAD </B>

*<b>[[terrorist|Sayid]]</b>: [[HOW CAN SHE SLAP?!?|Iraqi]] with 1337 skillz. Torturer. Breaks necks with his feet for the lulz. Always finding new things to triangulate. Every woman he falls in love with ends up murdered. Did Benjamin's bidding and killed many people (including himself) because he's too retarded to realize he's a tool.  Recently became [[star wars|Darth Vader]] after The Monster offered to bring his dead girlfriend back to life. He later had a change of heart and went [[an hero]] [[for great justice|to save every one else's lives]], or because he is [[islam|muslim]] and [[jihad|that's just what muslims do]]. <B>DEAD</B>

*<b>[[whore|Juliet]]</b>: Former [[porn|porn star]] and fertility doctor who's known for [[murder|killing women]] and their [[abortion|babies]] on the island. Likes to read books and share her opinions on them with other people in her bookclub. Once had lesbian sex with Angelina Jolie. On the island, hooks up with Sawyer, which is unfortunate for everybody who isn't Sawyer. Ends up [[pwn|pwning]] the population of the pregnant woman at the end of the Dharmaville season, <s>and no one knows if she will become [[an hero]] until next season</s> is totally dead, but manages to have a [[tl;dr|death soliloquy]] in spite of having been right next to a nuclear explosion.  Her death causes Sawyer to turn into a [[drunk|drunk]] [[emo|emo]] with [[shit|shit]] stained underwear. SPOILER ALERT: EVERYONE IS DEAD <B> NO REALLY? YES. DEAD. </B>

*<b>[[weegee|Benjamin Linus]]</b>: [[Cancer|Wheelchair]] cubbyhole-hidin' bitch-ass baton-wielding motherfucka that plays head games and lies about everything because he is too [[Tom Cruise|creepy and annoying]] to have friends. Rumored to have genetically inherited eyes from an insect. Had a crush on Juliet and was rejected for being too damn ugly and a creeper. He killed her love interest on the island because he's a jealous, manipulative bastard. Also, had his own daughter killed by accident because he's a manipulative bastard who's willing to gamble the lives of even those he gives a shit about. Father of Hannibal Lecter. Gassed his dad and threw Locke in a mass grave after he shot him. Now he is [[John Locke|John Locke's]] pet bunny, geddit? <B> DEAD.</b> See <i>Hurley</i>.

*<b>[[Asking for it|Alex]]</b>: Danielle's long lost hot [[16 year old girl|16 year old daughter]] that was kidnapped by The Others, possibly so Ben can make a vest out of her flesh because he's <s>crazy</s> totally normal. The first character in TV history to actually get shot in one of those scenes where somebody is pointing a gun at them and threatening somebody else that they'll "totally do it"; Keamy actually did it. What a badass. <B> DEAD </B>

*<b>[[Jesus|Desmond]]</b>: Was shipwrecked on the island and spent three years in a hatch pushing a button and [[fapping]] with Dharma ranch dressing. Inevitably doomed everyone and made the flight Oceanic crash when he failed to do his job. Calls everyone "brotha", supposedly because he was a monk for like three days.  Probably a [[George_W._Bush|closet racist]]. Was once a member of the [[shit nobody cares about|Royal Scots Regiment]]. Had visions of Charlie dying, and knows where lightning is going to strike. Predicted 9/11 and [[2012]]. Has epic seizures where he goes back in time and Daniel Faraday tries to get him to save everyone. The only character to get a happy ending (the actor's reward for molesting cast members). Shot to <b>death</b> by Ana Lucia. <B>DEAD</B>

*<b>Ana Lucia</b>: A dyke bitch with a bad attitude who likes to abuse her power. Put on the island after failing at being a [[Police brutality|cop]] and actress. Realizing she also starred in a crappy [[Resident Evil]] movie, Michael decided to shoot her. Fortunately, she died after being pounded by Sawyer in the jungle. <i>NOT</i><b>DEAD</b> - possible spin off.

*<b>Libby</b>: Psychiatrist. Stopped Hurley from sinking the island by throwing himself off a cliff. Fell in love with him to make him feel better about his ranch sauce addiction and his inferiority complex. Purposely got herself killed to avoid commitment. Because she's dead Hurley will die alone. The producers/writers say that she'll never be seen again, as they continue to make up shit as they go along.

*<b>Shannon</b>: [[Incest|Incestuous]] [[cum slut]] and sister of Boone. Was glad when he died because he was constantly in her grill about shit. Fell in love with Sayid and made plans with him to build a sand fort together in Iraq. Was shot by Ana Lucia because she didn't know how to STFU while walking in the jungle.

*<b>Bernard and Rose</b>: Old, fat white guy and his [[fat|bootylicious]] black person wife. According to the writers, they were forced to edit out many potentially [[DO NOT WANT|sexy]] love scenes. Possibly removed because, on a timetravelling island with smoke monsters and polar bears, it would be too much of a stretch to think that Bernard can still get it up. Oh did i forget to mention they're <b>DEAD.</b> Although Rose was seemingly the only black person in PurgatoryLA.

*<b>Crazy French Lady</b>: Old crackwhore. Runs around being [[black_people|dirty and savage]].  Excels in staring at the camera crazily. Steals from Sawyer's porn collection and Charlie's pot stash, then blames [[Anonymous|"The Others"]] for doing it. Wife of Tarzan. Recently [[pwned]] by a bullet through her tit. Returns in Dharmaville time to tell the story of how she [[pwned]] her team because there was no anti-crazy antidote.

*<b>[[Basement dweller|Daniel Faraday]]</b>: [[Neckbeard]] [[batshit]] scientist. Probably has [[Asperger's syndrome|Assburger's Syndrome]]. He feels the need to wear a tie on an island in the middle of fucking nowhere, as an example of pure [[nerd|nerdiness]]. Probably got beat up and had his lunch money stolen often as a kid. Recently got pwned by his mommy in the past because he was always mumbling and being an all-around annoying aspie. <B>DEAD</B>

*<b>Miles</b>: [[Azn]] disciple of [[Kenneth Eng]] and [[Cho Seung-Hui]] [[fanboi]]. Also a [[AngelofthyNight|ghostbuster]]. He finds them with his weird-ass vacuum thing. Don't ask. Locke made him eat a grenade because he hates mud races. Obvious [[necrophiliac]]. Son of Dr. Candle/Wickman/Wackface/Chinkman or some shit like that. Died on Ajira plane. <B>DEAD IS BETTER</B>[[Image:MilesPeanuts.jpg|thumb|Who said you could eat those peanuts?]][[Image:cholost.jpg|thumb|Thats no Miles.]]

*<b>Charlotte</b>: [[Ginger]] [[cunt]] from the UK. Got a nosebleed from eating chocolate and died, and was [[raped]] by Daniel as a child in a deleted scene, as she was [[asking for it]]. 

*<b>The Monster</b>: Giant black person cloud. Does nothing but kill people who are about to reveal answers.  Recently revealed to be the [[final boss]] of the island, taking Locke's form and recruiting people for his [[evil|eeeevil]] purposes. <s>His true name has not yet been revealed so fans have come to call him [[at least 100]] different things including [[woll smoth|The Man in Black]], [[flock|Flocke]], [[God hates fags|Esau]], [[bear|Smokey]], and [[pedobear|Jacob's]] [[Chris Hansen|Nemesis]]</s> in a massive troll by the writers, it was revealed that HE NEVER HAD A NAME. EVER. SPOILER ALERT: EVERYONE IS DEAD - <B>DEAD</B>

*<b>Richard</b>: <s>The main character of the show.</s> [[John Locke|Locke's]] current bitch.  Wears makeup because he's [[gay|secure in his masculinity]]. Stays the same age so he can bone young <s>chicks</s> boys forever.

*<b>Jacob</b>: King of the island, his true face was revealed in the finale of season 5. And is a [[stalker]] and a [[pedophile]]. Also the reason behind most of Benjamin's angst, because he never seems interested in him or his [[unwarranted self importance|ego]]. Later passes the torch to Jack who 10 minutes later, in a [[stupid|brilliant]] tactical decision [[retard|makes Hurly the new Jacob.]]

*<b>[[Typo|Arzt]]</b>: Highscool teacher who loves spiders, appeared in one episode where he BAWWWW'd about being a background character and wanted to do more. Then proceeded to get his ass blown to shit, proving that its safer to be a nobody. Except for that one time they killed all of them.

*'''[[Pedo|Tom Friendly]]''': Colossal [[faggot]] [[redneck]] and probable [[bear]]. Wanted to prison [[rape]] Sawyer, so Sawyer eventually shot him, as everyone thought he was the real Sawyer.  
[[Image:charliebear.jpg|thumb|Charlie is a well-known [[furry]].]]

*'''Jim Robinson''' from [[Neighbours]]: In a fail attempt to hide from worldwide [[Party Van|typecasting]] by starring in all known [[americunt]] tv shows and movies. Winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize and Shatner award for most over the top acting [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yATh1D-3u8&feature=related]], and at least 100% likely to die of an epic lulz heart attack at any moment.

*'''The Russian''': Has an insane [[Hacker|healing ability]]. Combined grenade with Charlie to produce lulz. Stabbed his own eye to prove that he's one of the cool kids.SPOILER ALERT: EVERYONE IS DEAD

*'''Frogurt''': Sold frozen yogurt off the island, but denied this fact to Hurley to avoid the [[vore|inevitable consequences]]. Got pwned by a flaming arrow.  Also wore a red shirt before getting pwned to death (Star Trek ripoff, anyone?).

*'''Steve/Scott''': [[Gay]] lovers who tried to reenact [[lulz|The Parent Trap]] on the island every episode.

*'''Vincent''': A cute puppy dog. Jacob, [[God]], or the Cloverfield monster hiding in a dog's body. Has magic powers to lick its own balls and never get hungry. Always disappears and then conveniently reappears to boost moral when everybody wants to kill themselves. 

*'''Penny''': Hot piece of ass who was almost replaced by a cardboard cutout because all of her scenes feature her staring wide-eyed at Desmond while being completely unimportant to the plot (she was trying to find the island, but Charles Widmore beat her to it without even trying very hard). Ben wants to kill her, probably because Juliet rejected him and he can't get a piece of ass of his own. Survives, sadly, to see if Desmond can predict when she'll die already.

*'''Matthew Abaddon''': <s>[[Pedophile]] black person. Very intriguing character with lots of important back story, so they'll probably never mention him again.</s> Dead.

*'''Christian''' <s>[[typo|Sheppard]]</s> '''Shephard''': Has a more religiously symbolic name than [[Jesus Christ]]. Off the island, he lets his bitch-ass son Jack push him around because he got caught drinking while performing surgery (who doesn't?). On the island, has fun by making Jack chase him off a cliff. Places bets with Jacob about whether or not he can convince [[Locke]] to do dumb shit like "move the island" and jump into a well.

*'''[[Old people|Eloise Hawking]]''': Old hag who tells Desmond to [[gtfo]] to the island or [[earth]] is [[pwned]] by [[2012]]. Is the mother of Daniel Faraday, and will always [[incest|love]] him. Had [[old]] [[people]] [[sex]] with Widmore. Due to go the same way as Widmore when they both get [[Aids]] together for the [[lulz]] and [[an hero|die]]. Forced the rescued survivors to go back to the island (but that's what [[dumb]] [[ass]] Jack doesn't think, thanks for the tip, [[Jihad|Sayid]].

<B>[[Stupid|EVERYONE IS DEAD]]</b>
(SPOILER ALERT)

==Doing it for the lulz==
[[J. J. Abrams]] as a result of this show, was outed as being [[moot]]. In the ultimate act of [[troll]]ing, put on his best trollface when concocting the story arc of Lost. Until the series finale, this long-suspected fact was often disputed. However, once the show ended and ultimately revealed nothing (and as such, disappointing a legion of fans), it was proven that he simply [[did it for the lulz]].

It also corroborates the notion that (much like The Island actually purgatory), that /b/ is, in fact, actually Hell.

*Triangle: Jack, Kate, and Sawyer, the hot threeway action Lost fans wish they had.
*Jate: Jack+Kate shipping. Has a knack for disregarding reality.  Kate already fucked Sawyer, so this pairing fails.
*Skate: Same, but filled with filthy [[furries]]. (Hence Josh Holloway's [[emo|"razor-free"]] stubble.)
*Jew: Sawyer+Juliet shipping. Canon now that the two have had sex.
*PBJ: Claire and Charlie. Most [[fanfiction]] includes [[crossover]] [[mpreg]] storylines. Total gay.
* [[cock|Cocke]]: Claire and [[Locke]], e.g a fifty year old man and a [[pregnant]] teenager. One of the sickest.
*Sayid: [[arab|Towelhead]]+[[Pro-ana]].  Shannon died, but deranged fanfic authors tend to do "Ghost Sayid" stories before [[your mom|their mom]] catches them in the basement. 
*Shoone: The most fucked up of the bunch, this features legal incest.  Unfortunately it's [[canon]] since Boone actually screwed his sister in one episode.
*Rescued: The charcters actually do end up getting rescued sometime. But when they return they're hit with [[real life|their pathetic fucking lives]], huge tax bills and decided to go back to the island to escape the bills.

== Lostpedia ==
{{quote|Desmond's ability to predict the future is actually him somehow channeling predictions from The Island or the magnetic force itself. This is demonstrated through the similarities between the hieroglyphs witnessed by [[Locke]], which were displayed on the Countdown Timer during the system failure, and Desmond's prediction. One interpretation of the hieroglyphs Locke saw in the hatch is "She/Rises to the sky/in Flames//He/Dies." The first part, "She/Rises to the sky/in Flames/" is the female part of the sentence (it's on a red background) and the second part "He/Dies" is male and is on black. This sounds similar to Desmond's prediction about Claire and Aaron getting into a helicopter and Charlie dying in The Looking Glass. SPOILER ALERT: EVERYONE IS DEADDesmond's abilities will develop and evolve as the series continues leading to the point of which he can travel through space and time at will. Because of this he will appear in other character's flashbacks and flashforwards with the knowledge he has in the present and try to stop them from coming to the island. The sound you hear between flashbacks and present event is the sound of Desmond breaking through time. The quarantine may also have been faked by Ben and the Others after the Purge, to keep the station inhabitants in their stations, and keep their various experiments running. The Monster would then be a security system meant to enforce the Quarantine, and perhaps deliver the Periodic Food Drops as well. Boone is alive and living underground with Charlie and Eko.|Typical Lostpedia User|A theory on why the polar bears attacked Sawyer in the first episode.}}

SPOILER ALERT: EVERYONE IS DEAD

A truly bizarre place that rivals 4chan in its ability to create memes. No matter what you post there, the bulk of the responses you receive will be either a out-of-context quote from the show or some other non-sequitur of a meme. During the Off-Season, everything worsens, as Off-Topic threads become a way of life. In other words, this board is epic beyond belief.
