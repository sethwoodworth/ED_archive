Friends list
The '''Friends list''', also referred to as '''FL''' or '''flist''', is a primary and compelling feature of [[LiveJournal]]'s software, and is often a stupid source of pointless drama.  It makes gathering friends ("[[friend]]ing") and reading their posts a simple one-click task.  But it is also what keeps many users locked into LJ's abusive and tightly controlled world, instead of choosing some other [[blog]]ging system.

The Friends list is often wielded as a special register of importance, and removal from it ("[[defriend]]ing") can cause anxiety and questioning from the removed.  Example: "I'm so fucking sick of that bitch, she is totally off my friends list." 

A "Friend of" list shows who has friended that person. It can be a source of endless drama when people get upset about [[serial adders]], [[trolls]], people they don't like, or ex-friends appearing in their list of supposed "friends".  These upset people often mistakenly think that people who have friended them can read their [[friends_only|"friends only"]] entries.  All the whining eventually caused LJ to make [[ban_set]] remove a "[[stalker]]" from the friend-of list, allow users to hide the list altogether, and implement the "Mutual Friends" list option.

In [[fandom]], one sign of a [[BNF]] is their extremely huge friend-of list.
