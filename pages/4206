James Watson

'''James Watson''' is the name of prominent black person [[scientist]] that [[you]] may know from your [[school|high school]] biology class as the man who, along with [[acid]] fiend Francis Crick, discovered the structure of DNA, winning him the 1962 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  However, [[shit nobody cares about|nobody really gives a shit]] about this, and Watson's most important work is actually very recent. After many frustrating years of research, James Watson successfully proved the link between [[Black People]] and [[stupid|a general lack of intelligence]].

==Prospect of Africa==
[[Image:Third leg.jpg|thumb|right|When determining what races are smartest, most scientists overlook pictures of Africa.]]

For years, thanks to some human rights activist in the sixties, everyone has believed that the intelligence of Africans was the same as the rest of the world. Watson, however, became the first person to show scientific evidence that [[truth|black people are actually less intelligent than white people]]. It only took a genetic biologist to finally state this obvious fact.

{{squote|''One of the world's most eminent scientists was embroiled in an extraordinary row last night after he claimed that black people were less intelligent than white people and the idea that "equal powers of reason" were shared across racial groups was a delusion. '''James Watson''', a Nobel Prize winner for his part in the unraveling of DNA who now runs one of America's leading scientific research institutions, drew widespread condemnation for comments he made ahead of his arrival in Britain today for a speaking tour at venues including the Science Museum in London. The 79-year-old geneticist reopened the explosive debate about race and science in a newspaper interview in which he said Western policies towards African countries were '''wrongly''' based on an assumption that black people were as clever as their white counterparts when "testing" suggested the contrary... Dr Watson told ''The Sunday Times'' that he was "inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa" because "'''all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours â€“ whereas all the testing says not really'''". He said there was a natural desire that all human beings should be equal but "people who have to deal with black employees find this not true."|[http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/article3067222.ece The UK Independent]}}

[[Image:Kramer niggers.jpg|thumb|right|Watson made some [[Kramer|new friends]] through all this.]]

The black community instinctively became so angered that they caused the rest of the white scientists around them to become so as well. Remember, your average laboratory has one black scientist for every ~10,000 white scientists. Using their [[Drugs|voodoo-hypnosis]] techniques, the black scientists were able to convince the other scientists to ban Watson from signing books, and from talking at the London Science Museum.

Not only was the black man's voodoo magic good enough to convince all the other scientists that Watson is wrong, but it was even [[Troll's remorse|able to convince Watson himself that he was wrong]].

==Mr. Watson has the last laugh== 
The fight wasn't over yet.  Watson got the better of all the [[genius|smart white folks]] by revealing that he was himself black and had DNA tests to prove it[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article3022190.ece].  Forced to accept that Watson knew what he was talking about, the scientific community agreed that he had conclusively proven that niggers are indeed [[retarded|not so bright]]. 

==Black Employees==
As well as finding the link between stupidity and Africa, Watson was also able to link this claim to [[Oxymoron|black employees]] being much less intelligent when compared to white employees. This all goes with what his new [[Hitler|"Genetic Inferiority Theory"]] states.

==Other Scientific Discoveries==

Along with his theories on black inferiority, Watson has made some other groundbreaking scientific discoveries, including his work on isolating the gene that controls [[homosexuality]], in order for him to pass a law that would make abortion legal for women whose babies are found to contain this gene.

He also discovered that blacks are more likely to commit [[rape]]. This theory is based off personal experience and the work of fellow scientist [[Common knowledge|Captain Obvious]].

Some of his current projects include an experiment which may discover the link between [[o rly?|fat people and laziness]].

Recently, Watson gained the [[head|support]] of [[mouth breathers]] everywhere when he [[lies|discovered]] that fellow scientist Rosalind Franklin was one of them.[[http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2007/10/watson_stoops_to_new_lows_in_c.php]]

Because of their talent for <s>missing the point</s> viewing things from a unique perspective, all [[Asspies]] now [[buttsecks|love]] Watson for allowing another famous dead scientist to join their [[circle jerk]].

{{Quote|I suspect that is probably the most insightful thing that Watson ever said about Franklin...
