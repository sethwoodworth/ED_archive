'''The Anti-Twilight Movement''', shortened to '''ATM''', is one of the more popular [[Twilight|Twilight]] hate sites. Ironically, the ATM is known for hating Anti's as much as [[Twitard|Twitards]], often posting equal amounts of blogs and hatemail [[lulz|LOL'ing at how retarded they both are.]] Despite making a website, their general apathy toward Twilight and lack of [[srs|serious business]] has brought up the theory that they don't actually care about [[Twilight|Twilight]] and are just really good trolls who are [[for_the_lulz|fucking with everyone.]] This has garnered them much negative attention in the Anti community, but also provided much lulz.

The site's main attractions are their [http://theantitwilightmovement.webs.com/mailbag.htm pages of Twifag hatemail], gallery of lulz, and general ridicule towards [[Twitard|Twitards]] and [[TwilightSucks|raving anti's]] alike.

The admins are [[anonymous|anonymous]] and mostly only appear to post blogs, sell shit, ban people, and ridicule their members for liking [[anime|anime]] and [[Harry_Potter|Harry Potter.]] The members of ATM are mostly [[loli]]s, [[furry|furfags]], and [[Maddox]] fans. 

== Feud with [[TwilightSucks|TwilightSucks]] ==

After a raging anti-Twilightfag posted a story on the [[TwilightSucks|TwilightSucks]] forum [[BAWWW|BAWWWING]] about a [[Twitard|Twitard]] who [[drama|viciously attacked her friend with acid]], the ATM decided to post a blog about the utter [[bullshit|bullshit]] of the story. They later added [[TwilightSucks|TS]] to their [[Epic_win|Wall of Shame]] because of all the [[truth|hypocritical bullshit]] and [[faggotry|raging preteen faggotry]] infecting the site, claiming that [[truth|TS was just as insane as Twitards, consisted mostly of trolls, stole content from their site, and lacked any content worth reading.]] TS members [[shitstorm|freaked the fuck out]], and rationalized the hate by calling theATM [[butthurt|butthurt and jealous.]] Administrator [[Mars Defden]] made the shitstorm official by [http://twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=11089 writing an entire thread dedicated to whining about it.]
<s>TheATM initially [[LOL|LOL'd]] at the drama, but eventually '''TS''' [[bitch|nagged]] them so much they finally [[fail|gave in and made peace.]] But mostly theATM [http://z13.invisionfree.com/antitwilightmovement/index.php?showtopic=311&st=0#entry2169096 doesn't really care,] and is probably just [[I_did_it_for_the_lulz|fucking with them.]]</s> [http://theantitwilightmovement.webs.com/shame.htm Disregard that, back on the Wall of Shame.]

<s>The ATM has, as of late, taken to [[Irony|banning any member for questioning the situation]], whether they were a member at the time or not for retarded reasons like asking questions and changing anything that contradicts their [[faggot|dear leader]] with, [[BAWWW|"BAWWWWWWWWW"]]

[http://www.twilightsucks.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=740521#p740521 ...Odds are, if you resort to banning people for asking the same question over and over, then you aren't explaining yourselves properly. Or at all in this case.] They just take the equivalent of [[BAWWW|cramming their fingers in their ears and whistling dixie.]]</s> [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/6/6f/Lolexposed.png O I see what you did thar.]

== APRIL FOOLS MOTHERFUCKERS ==
[[Image:SERIOUS DOG.jpg|thumb|left]]
As an [[April Fool's]] joke, ATM deleted their site and [http://theantitwilightmovement.webs.com/LOL.htm replaced it with a very serious puppy instead,] then decided to leave it up for a few months [[i_did_it_for_the_lulz|just to fuck with people.]] This was followed by much[[butthurt|butthurt]] on the part of angry site members, which [http://theantitwilightmovement.webs.com/blog.htm?blogentryid=4536540 greatly amused the admins.]
