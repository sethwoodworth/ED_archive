Left 4 Dead
{{spoiler| IN THE SACRIFICE FINALE YOU ARE THE OLD SURVIVORS WERE YOU HAVE TO DIE SO YOUR TEAM WILL ESCAPE!1!!!!!!11!1!!!!1!!}}


'''''Left 4 Dead''''' and '''''Left 4 Dead 2''''' are ''Half-Life 2'' mods designed by [[Bulletball|Marc Griffin]] that pits four U.S. border guards against a horde of [[Mexicans|Mexican zombies]] that [[Zerg rush]] them continuously, trying to enter the United States illegally. The games are notable for their high [[Sarcasm|re-playability]] and dynamically generated content, ensuring that [[Lie|no two playthroughs are ever the same]]. They also are ideal FPS games for those chickenshits and [[13 year old boys]] who cannot play against real live armed players for shit in [[Call of Duty 4]] because they prefer easy and unarmed zombies instead of other [[basement dwellers|people]]. The story behind it is some [[BitingBeaver|bitch]] bit a guy and it spread like [[Swine Flu|rabies]], just like every other zombie apocalypse. It also has a Faggot [[Fleshlight|Flashlight]] that is [[Zapatero|Magic]] and [[Yes|doesn't make a Fucking Difference]]

==Characters==
At the heart of ''Left 4 Dead's'' [[sarcasm|deep and well-written]] storyline are eight main characters that the average player will find difficult not to relate to, and find it hard to find them somewhat interesting.

===Protagonists===
====L4D====
*'''[[Oldfag|Bill]]''': 98 year old acid addict and former [[Metal_Gear_Solid|FOX]] member who believes he is a war veteran because he wore a uniform to his daughter's 13th birthday for a stripper act and forgot to take it off before he passed out from his latest ecstasy rave. He was based off [[Dane_Cook|Josef Fritzl]] and started the zombie apocalypse by multiplying with his children. [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|DIES IN THE SEQUEL! BOO-HOO!]]

*'''[[B^U|Francis]]''': [[pussy|Hardcore]] biker and [[Internet tough guy]]. He commonly goes on 4chan and spams all boards with the message "ima biker [[IRL]]!!!!11!!!!!111111oneelven1" Has an obvious thing for Bill, and openly longs to see him smear [[cum|boomer vomit]] all over his body as evidenced by the opening movie. [[Nietzsche|Hates FUCKING EVERYTHING]]. Except vests and apparently niggers as he develops jungle fever for Rochelle in the sequel.

*'''[[Nigra|Louis]]''': Touted by the developers as a representation of the every-day man trying to survive in a chaotic situation, but obviously thrown in at the last moment to fill their black person quota. Be sure to shout [[ALL_CAPS|"PEEELZ HERE!"]] when you see Louis [[sarcasm|cause that stupid meme hasn't played itself out yet.]] In the sequel he injures his leg and can't walk, meaning he is just another black guy trying to get out of doing work. 

*'''[[Every girl who plays L4D thats right the entire 7 of them|Zoey]]''': [[16 year old girl]] added to include at least one pair of boobs that hasn't half-way decomposed. Adds an element of fantasy to the game, as she is able to take more than one hit of damage before [[Woman|collapsing into tears]], and avoids rape while alone with three men who will undoubtedly never see [[pussy]] again. In the sequel she seems to have a crush on Ellis, which makes her a stand-in for all the 13 year old girls who want him to fuck them. 

*'''Chicago Ted''': [[Meme]] commonly used on the ''Left 4 Dead'' Steam Forums. Originated from Seanbaby's [http://seanbaby.com/cleveland/index.html Ultimate Article.] In the article, Seanbaby writes that he and [[Centipede filled vagina|Erik]] saw "No bitch is safe from Chicago Ted!" written in a bathroom stall. This was referenced to by Valve via a small inscription on a saferoom wall that reads "No zombie is safe from Chicago Ted." [[Moar]] info on Chicago Ted can be accessed on the Chicago Ted thread (probably dead at the moment) which is now [[at least 100]] pages long. Not even Chair zombie can kill this hero.

[[Image:NickxEllis.jpg|thumb|right|Left 4 Dead 2 is basically Brokeback Mountain with [[Furfags|zombies]].]]
[[Image:Coach_Heals_Dat_Ass_by_Xtermination.png|thumb|right|Left 4 Dead 2. Now with 25% more black person.]]

====L4D2====
*'''[[Redneck|Ellis]]''': A 23 year old mechanic with [[ADD]] who will ramble on about his pal Keith and never shuts the fuck up. He likes everything, including [[Mr. Hands|horses]] and Nick's cock up his ass. Being a pretty boy and stupid has made him a [[Fantard|fangirl]] magnet. Single-handedly responsible for making [[16 year old girls]] play the game, angering all male nerds since L4D is SRS BUSINESS [[gay|and vagina ruins everything!]] He wants to marry and impregnate Zoey which makes his boyfriend Nick jealous.

*'''[[Fresh Prince|Coach]]''': A large black ex-<s>football(not the faggot kind Europeans play)</s>handegg player who has obviously caught the dangerous [[fat|boomer]] disease and is slowly turning in to the first black person boomer. [[Fresh Prince|His first name is Uncle and his last name is Phil]]. He is obsessed with chocolate like all fat people, and has an  [[LOLWUT|ass-healing fetish]]. 

*'''<s>[[Sheneequa|Rochelle]]</s> A GIRL''': A [[black chicks|black chick]] who was once a news reporter and [[Twitter]] user. She is a fan of [[Bisexual|Depeche Mode]] and was created so there can be lesbian [[34]]s that do not require the [[Bitch|Witch]]. When you misfire and hit her, she bobs her head and goes "OH NO YOU DID-N'T!". She is also the most hated character in the game, mainly because she has the personality of the average ironing board. Actually, she is so uninteresting that her major personality trait is the fact that she has a [[pussy]].

*'''[[Jerk|Nick]]''': A [[con]]man with a really expensive white suit he stole from a [[Mexican]] drug dealer after killing him. He went to Georgia to scam the inbred hillbillies, but instead found the state full of zombies and niggers. He spends most of the game acting like a [[drama queen]] and sexually harassing his young [[twink]] Ellis. Even though he will sometimes yell out "TITS!" like a [[retard]], he doesn't mean it. [[faggot|He just wants cock.]] 

*'''[[Cock boat|Virgil]]''': A magical boat with a Cajun accent.

*'''[[Metallica|The Midnight Riders]]''': Non-playable southern rock band that Ellis and Coach jerk off to. Their songs are about [[awesome|beating shit up, driving motorcycles, kicking ass, and fucking women]]. Rochelle, being a cunt, points out that they lip-sync.

*'''[[Subeta|Keith]]''': Ellis's old boyfriend who has now replaced Chicago Ted on the ''Left 4 Dead 2'' Steam Forums as the most powerful entity in the universe.

===Zombies===
====L4D1 Bosses====
[[Image:Nighttrain.JPG|thumb|right|Brilliant writing and character development give way to thoroughly engrossing protagonists.]]

*'''[[Fat|Boomer]]\[[Gabe Newell|Gabe]]''': Not actually one of the infected, but an [[You|average, treacherous fat person]] like the CEO of VALVe who made this game. Vomits on players to arouse spectating zombies so much that they can't help but get in on the action. Explodes in a mess of vomit and cheeseburgers, as all [[fat]] people do. Also proof that Left 4 Dead isn't set in America, or about 70% of the infected would be boomers.

*'''[[Chav|Hunter]]''': Infected who were once [[Cute|abused]]. Throughout the entire game will run around being sneaky and [[Ninja|hiding in the dark]]. As with all [[Emo|emos]], they are unable to contain themselves at the thought of Bill's ass, and are often heard making loud, growly snarling sounds like the controllers in Half-Life, giving away their location. Being the "least ugly" out of all the special infected, hordes of [[Fat|fangirls]] dream of fucking him. Because getting turned on by a [[Necrophilia|rotting zombie]] is [[Sick fuck|awwwwight.]]

*'''[[Tentacle rape|Smoker]]''': An altered version of a design previously proposed by a [[Tentacle rape|Japaneesu man]], the smoker attacks by flinging its [[dick|long phallus of a tongue]] up to about thirty meters, [[Rape|and using it to squeeze the life out of its victim.]]  

[[Image:Lindsay_lohan_jeremy_piven_party.jpg|thumb|right|You've startled the Witch!]]

*'''[[Killdozer|Tank]]''': Entity thrown in by the game engine to <b>[[Delete Fucking Everything|ruin fucking everything]]</b> if the players are determined to be performing too well. Throws shit and takes a million hits to kill.  Is able to magically turn cars, baggage carts, and any other [[cock|large objects]] into balls of paper that can travel limitless distances with the swing of a fist.  [[lulz|Laughs are generated]] if a fully-healed player is knocked off a roof in one hit. 

*'''[[Bitch|Witch]]''': Sits in the middle of your path [[emo|crying for no reason]].  When called out for being an obvious [[attention whore]], goes [[I_TOUCHED_HIS_PENIS!!_OMG|BATSHIT INSANE]] and runs all over the place screaming and clawing at its victim while pushing everyone else out of the way like a [[bitch]]; Typical [[LiveJournal]] user. 

*'''[[Emo|Screamer]]''': A special infected that only a select few individuals have encountered and is a playable infected by using VALVe's secret code by [[Truth|pressing Alt and F4 simultaneously]], accept confirmation, etc. Was an emo and always will be an emo, too pussy to attack even in its afterlife and resorts to screaming at the top of its lungs to alert [[Over 9000|over 9000]] zombies to you which make the game crash......'''RAGEQUIT'''.

====L4D2 Bosses====
*'''[[fap|Charger]]''': Re-uses remixed zombie sounds from Half-Life 2 because VALVe can't be fucked. It charges the fuck at you and blows you out of the way then continues to ass rape you by pinning you with his fappin' arm. This Infected was not actually thought up by VALVe but a uncredited steam forum user called ms255. VALVe emailed him saying that the infected was based on different whiteboard ideas; ms255's response was [[Tits_or_gtfo|"Tits or GTFO"]].

*'''[[whore|Spitter]]''': A special infected meant to split your trolling team up. She spits what used to be sperm, but a chemical reaction turned all the sperm into a dangerous mass of acid. Has as much jaw as fanboys have brains and just "spits" the fuck out of you in lame attempts to separate the group so she can rape the males. VALVe reportedly paid noted beauty Sarah Jessica Parker $8,000,000 to model for the Spitter.

[[Image:Mini_me_verne_troyers.jpg|thumb|right|When not called on to attack the survivors, the Jockey manages to lead a normal life.]]

*'''[[lol|Mudmen]]''': As VALVe calls it, a "uncommon common infected". [[Stupid|Genius]]. Runs on all fours and uses a cheap GUI effect that is mud on your screen. VALVe classes this as being sophisticated enough for a game. Mudmen are the closest things to a real black person in the game, so prioritize them above other infected.

*'''[[An Hero|Fallen Survivor]]''': A survivor who got [[rape|raped]] by zombies and is now infected. Runs like hell if spotted. If killed will drop some items to pick up, like health kits and molotovs. Grab them for yourself and refuse to use them for teh [[lulz]].

*'''[[Bitch|Wandering Witch]]''': VALVe ran out of ideas and decided to make the Witch able to walk in daytime mindlessly. Remember: you win 1000 points if you shoot the witch in a non-lethal spot while all survivors are around her! Also, walking up to her and flashing your light in her face will achieve the same effect.
**'''[[Jennifer Wilbanks|Bride Witch]]''': Appears only in The Passing. Cries while "Here comes the bride" plays in the background, and gets PO'd when hillbilly rock plays.

*'''[[Gary Coleman|Jockey]]''': To appease the number of [[sick fuck]]s out there, VALVe decided to include a zombie that not only looks like [[Josef Fritzl]], but also will fucking [[Rape|rape]] your head like it's going out of style. Srsly. But of course, a real rape scene in a video game would make every game rating official across the world have a fucking orgy of [[Banned|B&]], so VALVe made it unrealistic by giving you a little bit of choice in the direction it goes. Also has some [[Cripple|disease]] that makes him a [[Midget|midget.]]

*'''[[Shay|Female Boomer]]''': Just imagine a more attractive version of [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. The female Boomer is exactly like the male Boomer, except she's suppressed by the other special infected and is treated like their little zombie [[Bitch]]. Her actual name is Lynn. If you see her there is a rule: you need to yell '''INSTANT FAP!''' as loud as you can while pressing "C".

==Realism Mode==

L4D2 introduces the much-vaunted realism mode, which boasts the following [[Bullshit|realistic features]]: 

* 8 adults, [[Dumbasses|none of whom know how to swim.]]
* [[Anorexic|Emancipated girl]] with sharp fingernails who can [[Pwn|outright kill someone]] with one claw swipe.
* [[Steroids|Giant overgrown zombie]] that somehow still takes hundreds of bullets before it finally dies. (Real bullets traveling through a big target made of mostly muscle mass would tear it to shreds, see: ballistic gel tests)
* Infected that somehow survive for weeks without food, water or sleep. By the time L4D2 happens, the zombies would either have starved to death or [[Cripple|barely be able to move,]] let alone run at top speed and attack like maniacs, making you slow to a crawl with a single hit.
* Ankle deep water that makes you move like a [[Retard|crippled toddler.]]
* [[America|An entire country full of guns, ammo piles, health kits, pain pills, etc.]] but not a single knife that could be useful for say, cutting a fucking smoker's [[Cock|tounge]] while it's [[Rape|strangling]] your ass.
* Survivors that can jury rig a pipe bomb with a ticking alarm to explode, but can't figure that just throwing the damn alarms would keep the zombies occupied as well.
* Military that's too stupid use drop chemical weapons on the zombies, opting to use [[Terrorism|expensive, infastructure damaging bombs instead.]]

==AI Director==

The AI Director is the in-game version of [[God]] almighty.  The AI Director can make your zombie killing experience a breeze, or a trip through hell.  It basically works like this; If you do poorly, the AI Director will have mercy on you and give you extra medkits and pills.  If you do well, the AI Director will go completely [[batshit crazy]] and dump an impossible to survive zombie [[rape|rapefest]] on you until you and your entire team is dead.  This is especially prevalent on Advanced and Expert, where the AI Director will randomly decide that you need to die, right fucking now, and there's nothing you can do about it.  Enjoy coming out of the rescue closet, [[fag]].

==Fanbase==

The L4D fanbase is broken up into two groups. First is the all male group made up of lonely [[basement dwellers]] and [[13 year old boys]] who suck at [[Halo]]. They mostly congregate on the ''Left 4 Dead 2'' Steam Forums and bitch and whine about every little thing imaginable in the games. Usually how the special infected suck in Versus, when in actuality they just suck playing them. How the crappy first game, which is the same stupid game as the sequel except even more buggy, worse characters, and with less crap, was [[Lie|better]]. Complaining how they are VALVe's bitch compared to [[Team Fortress 2]]. They don't get no silly hats. Or making 8,000,000 demands that VALVe has to fulfill or they will scream and cry like the little 5 year old girls they are. 

It's no wonder VALVe hates their guts and avoids interacting with them. It is said that VALVe chieftain [[fat|Gabe Newell]] only visits this asshole of the internet to lick the salty tears as they drip down the forum's face. Then he eats another sandwich. 

The other group is made up of [[16 year old girls]] who draw and write about Ellis screwing Nick or Zoey. They came for the [[yaoi|Nick/Ellis]] and Ellis/Zoey and don't give a shit about anything else.

These two groups never mix, so for maximum lulz be sure to troll the ''Left 4 Dead 2'' Steam Forums with topics like "Should Ellis and Zoey get married?" or go for the jugular with "Does Ellis spit or swallow Nick's cum after blowing him?"

There is also a small subgroup of female fans that make the ugly and hideous zombies, like the Hunter and Smoker, all sexy for whatever stupid fucking reason. [[Sick_fuck|Apparently having rotting eyes or cancerous tumors is a turn on to some.]] These girls have an I.Q. below 75 and should be mocked and kept from breeding. They are also often furries(see below) which explains a lot.  

L4D has also managed to attract a number of [[furries]] and [[weeboos]]. Furries taint everything so their presence can be explained. Weeboos likely because the game inexplicably became very popular in Japan. Even [[troll|Hideo Kojima]] is said to be a huge fan of the games which might explain why his [[Metal Gear Solid|own games started to suck.]]

==Online Drama==
Much drama ensued when Left 4 Dead 2 was announced. The first dramatic turn of events was the [[jews|ESRB]] telling Valve that the cover having three fingers missing from the hand was '''unacceptable'''. The hand was the same one as on the previous cover, except the index and middle finger were bitten off with the thumb. The ESRB said those two should be tucked behind the hand, [[lolwut|still giving the impression that they were missing]] and [[retard|the thumb could stay]]. When asked why this was, the ESRB promptly responded with "[[Tits or GTFO]]".
[[Image:L4D2covercontroversy.jpg|thumb|[[Serious Business|Hands on the cover are serious business.]]]]

The second drama to happen was with the fans. Hours after seeing the announcement for the sequel, they all had a heart-attack and sprinted to their laptops to post a petition against the release (inspired by the many that have worked before). Why? Because they don't want a new cast, new gameplay, new zombies, new '''anything'''. Even though they've wasted hundreds of hours playing the same shit, memorizing the layout, and finding all the glitches. They cannot possibly show off their mad skillz if a new game comes out. They [[bawww]]ed about the game until Valve finally told them to STFU, and that their boycott didn't do shit. 

Valve then invited the two leaders of the boycott to take a trip to their HQ to play the game pre-release, to which they were rightfully put in their place and realized that they were being retarded and will now almost definitely buy the game. As a result of this 'Selling out' the rest of the butthurt boycotters have proceeded to label the leaders as traitors or bribed by Valve. Because that is much easier for them than to accept that their own faults. All of this amounted to a big nothing as L4D2 sold like heroin in the suburbs and everyone ended up buying it.

<strike>Austrians</strike> Australians also got into some drama. The [[Australia| Ausfaglian]] version of the ESRB royally [[Banned|banned]] Left 4 dead 2 from being sold in Australia. This desion made many Ausfaglian [[Gamers|gamers]] [[RAGE|rage]] that they would not be able to kill 3 new types of zombies with a black person and an axe. [[Nazi|OFLC]] were [[Baw|bawwing]] about how the game was too violent for [[13 year old boys| people]] under 15, even though most Ausfaglian gamers are [[virgin| 21-35]]. [[shit nobody cares about| VALVe has since released a statement saying there pretty "bummed" about the decision, and have now submitted an edited down version.]]
