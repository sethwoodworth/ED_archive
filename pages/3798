Human flesh search engine
'''Human Flesh Search Engine''' is how the [[Chinese]] refer to the phenomenon of thousands of [[Anon]]s whipped up into a frenzy of searching, Google Earthing and doxing in one of their periodic stampedes of mob justice. It is given its own page here because it sounds awesomely cool, like something out of [[The Human Centipede]].
