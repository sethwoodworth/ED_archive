A '''Zombie''' is a dead person who hasn't figured out what "dead" is supposed to mean yet. Unlike [[vampire]]s, zombies are bone-[[stupid]] and can do only three things: 

#Shuffle
#Groan
#Eat
#Rape

Their favorite food is human flesh, particularly brains, making most skinny [[scene]] kids essentially invulnerable. One wonders why they don't just eat each other, but apparently mindless corpses are picky eaters.  With the rise in [[basement dweller|internet culture]] on [[4chan|4-chan]], [[Gaiaonline]] and Encyclopedia Dramatica in these past few years however, one can only assume that they are merely getting annoyed with [[you|us]].

Sometimes they will eat the hell out of anything that moves (dogs/horses/mice/bugs), while [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095990/ yet other times]], they like [[kittens]]. [[true|a lot]].

==[[Meme]]==
Zombies have been a popular subject of horror movies since director George Romero got a bunch of [[Homeless|amateur actors]] together, smeared them with Bisquick and dirt, and filmed a movie where [[everyone dies]]. He did this several dozen times over the next few decades, adding more red food coloring each time, and every [[shit|crap-ass]] filmmaker looking to make a quick buck followed suit, realizing that not only are zombie movies cheap and uncomplicated, they also benefit from [[Retard|a completely undiscriminating audience]].

Zombies are similar to [[ninja]]s, [[pirate]]s, and [[Monty Python]], in that any inherent entertainment value they might have had for [[you]] is now hopelessly [[ruin]]ed by years of [[fucktard]]s screaming OMG NINJAS VS PIRATES - NO NO WAIT - '''ZOMBIE''' PIRATES, like that somehow [[Uncyclopedia|makes them funny]].

[[THEN AL WAS A ZOMBIE]] is another not-meme-meme

==Christianity==

Every so often, an [[idiot|irreverent]] [[atheist]] is struck by a brainstorm: hey - like, Jesus died and shit!  And then he came back!  From the grave, man!  That totally makes Jesus a zombie LAWL UR WORSHIPIN [[Zombo.com|ZOMBO-GOD]] U ST00PID SHEEPLE.

This <strike>unique</strike>, <s>edgy</s> idea has occurred to over a thousand people before you, so shut the fuck up before Thomas Aquinas rises from ''his'' grave and [[rapes|beats]] [[you]] to death.

==[[Shit nobody cares about|Zombie Characteristics]]==
Some zombies are caused by radiation and others by disease, some are fast and some are slow, but [[shit nobody cares about|no one really cares]] because when there are a couple thousand dead people nearby who want to eat your face, the finer points of zombie taxonomy just don't register on the importance scale.

Example: [[:Image:ZombieArghRun.jpg|Radiation zombie, virus zombie, or your mom]]? Either way, RUN AWAY!

===Dangers of Hanging out with Zombies===
Even though [[your mom|EVERYONE]] KNOWS WHAT ONE IS- people seem to get into avoidable situations with zombies '''every day'''.<br> 
[[You]] may think zombies are cool, but you might not have thought about just how uncool it would be to spend time around the living dead.<br> 

Hopefully, this helps- and you '''stop liking zombies'''.<br>

*'''Lots of Walking''' - Zombies do not drive, and like [[crack|crackheads]], they are constantly on the move. They are kinda dicks, and make you do a lot of walking/running to keep up. jerks.<br>

*'''Being Outside''' - Zombies are notorious for trolling buildings. They hate houses, and have declared a fucking jihad on doors & windows.<br>

*'''Being Eaten''' - this one is kinda obvious, but really. they will fucking [[gay|EAT YOU]]. if physical activity and being outside weren't bad enough for [[you]].<br>

*'''Face Biting''' - no one is really sure why, but people really [[srsly|REALLY]] like to put their faces in zombies faces (only to be bitten). whether due to the not-understanding of the nature of zombies, or what. anyway, it [[lie|has been documented]] [[at least 100]] times.<br>

*'''Property Value Depreciation''' - Zombies will bring your neighborhood's resale down faster than any other minority.<br>

*'''Go Crazys''' - Dead people are creepy, and they smell bad. plus they are old and don't have anything lulzy to say- so hanging out is reaaaly stupid. you'll go [[batshit insane|crazys]]. i've seen it.<br>

*'''Social Limitations''' - Zombies totally will make you a shut-in. It's a well-known [[fact]] that when a zombie is around, your [[Neckbeard]] Generaton stat goes up +30%<br>

*'''Humor Atrophy''' - zombies do not use the internets, so they are immune to the lulz. it'll happen to you too.<br>

*'''Viruses/Internets Rot Disease''' - Again, even though they do not use internets, zombies still manage to sign you up for spam email and forward you 'lols'<br>

*'''Send Moar Police!''' - Unlike everyone else, zombies like the [[police]]. you crazy, zombie.<br>

*'''Practical Jokes''' - Zombies are practical jokers, and love to catch you when you aren't looking and <b>bite you to death</b>. don't expect to catch any sleep with these clowns around!<br>

in summation- [[noob|nubs]] think zombies are cool because they have never spent time with any (like black people).

==Zombies and Michael Jackson==
Zombies are well known for their past alliances with <s>[[Michael Jackson]]</s> [[aliens]]. However, relying on Michael Jackson to protect you in case of a zombie invasion would be unwise, as Michael Jackson is now one of the walking dead these days.

update:<br>
Seemingly failing at being [[white]], Mr. Jackson decided to try to co-opt a new ethnicity, [[dead]].<br>
I talked to one the other day, and it seems like recently the zombie community at large has sought to distance themselves from MJ.

==Zombies as a metaphor==
Many filmmakers and writers like to use zombies as a metaphor, or as social commentary.  Zombies' lack of brains make them ripe for incisive, scathing comparisons with people who shop in [[Hot Topic|malls]], people who enjoy [[Fat|eating food]], people who walk city streets and other members of society deserving of satire in poorly-scripted films.

Dissolute English majors with no plan for their lives will often choose to study zombie films as a "specialty", because classic literature is hard and has lots of words.

Brains eh? What's that all aboot?

==Max Brooks==
[[Image:126885687326.jpg‎|thumb|[[You]] might not be able to get any living [[pussy]] now, but you will get some undead pussy after the Zombie Apocalypse.]] 
Author Jew did the world a disservice in 2003 by writing and publishing [http://www.amazon.com/Zombie-Survival-Guide-Complete-Protection/dp/1400049628/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204236883&sr=8-1 ''The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead''], a mildly amusing parody of those "worst-case survival guide" books favored by [[conservatives|gun nuts]], [[liberals|conspiracy theorists]], and [[Trying too hard|overly-earnest]] [[Pedophilia|Boy Scout troop leaders]]. ...Until the book comes equipped with built-in ZOMBIE DETECTING/DESTROYING LAZERz, would hardly call it 'complete protection from the living dead'.

Zombie movie fans latched onto the book and treated it as a goddamn [[lies|Bible]], as if Brooks actually intended his advice to be used in anything resembling a life-or-death situation.  Sure, they reluctantly acknowledged that Brooks' fictional "past outbreaks" were fiction, but that wasn't the ''point'', they'd tell you. No, no - the point is that the Zombie [[Holocaust]] ''could'' happen, and it probably ''will'', and [[Unrealistic Expectations|they'll be the only ones who are prepared]]!

If we're to believe these people, the truly successful resistance to zombie attacks will be that put up by [[13 year old boy]]s whose only acquaintance with firearms is what Max Brooks said about them in the "Weapons" section.

'''And then I'll pull out my ''[[weeaboo|wakizashi]]'' and do a [[Barrel Roll|''backflip'']] and [[Internet tough guys|cut the zombie in ''half'']]! [[Yinepusayi|PWN]]!!!1'''

Or, you know, you'll [[Piss|wet]] your Spiderman Underoos in terror and your cheap con-shop "blade" will shatter on the pavement when it slips from your shaking, [[Basement Dweller|Cheetos-stained]] fingers. Same difference.

Brooks followed up on this with [http://www.amazon.com/World-War-Z-History-Zombie/dp/0307346617/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/184-8784809-6742814?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230055712&sr=8-1 ''World War Z''], in which the author asked his [[Mental illness|imaginary friends]] about their thrilling adventures in the exciting World of the Dead.  Much of the book consisted of [[Shit nobody cares about|trenchant sociopolitical commentary]].

== Obama connection ==
According to a investigation by [[Fox News]], [[Satan|President Obama]] is actually a voodoo magician turning [[Americans|White People]] into zombies during the 2008 election. His new [[Murder|health care reform]] actually aims to turn more people into zombies. If you see a smiling census worker standing at your door, get a goddamn [[Rifle|rifle]], will ya?
