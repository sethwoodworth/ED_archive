There's a lot of [[crap|crappy]] [[pop]] stars in the [[world]] today, but have you ever heard of one so [[fucktard|fucktarded]] as to sample ''The Sound of Music'' in a club track? Meet '''Gwen Stefani''', 38 year old [[Realitysquared|lordy assface]] of the pop music industry.
==Her 'Talent'==
Gwen has no talent. If one listens to the studio and live versions of her songs, it's easy to tell that her voice is more heavily edited than [[TOW|TOW's]] [[Stephen Colbert|African Elephants article]]. Further analysis shows that Gwen doesn't exactly sing, but instead mumbles and whines through her rather pronounced proboscis, with one microphone shoved up one nostril, and second shoved up either her vagina or her rectum to provide two channels for stereo recording.

Listening to Gwen's attempts at music is strongly advised against, as the AMA has confirmed that exposure to anything associated with Gwen will cause a colony of [[cancer|cancerous]] [[brain]] [[tumor|tumors]] to spring out of nowhere and [[death|kill]] you within 10 seconds. To get an idea of what she sounds like without committing [[suicide]], imagine an Emu having a massive organ failure and shooting [[balls|testicles]] out of its ass. For some reason, [[Scuzz|hipster kids]] love this dreadful sound, most likely because [[pedophile|the ear-fucking they got from their dads]] as children made them deaf. That and they're [[hipster|scenewhores]] who love how she looks. See: [[TOW]] for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollaback_Girl featuring an article on one of her all-time most craptastic songs.]

==Her 'music'==
Gwen started out in the third-wave [[ska]] band No Doubt, who jumped onto the scene in 1995, and then quickly fell victim to the [[nobody gives a shit]] curse. Regardless, they released 3 albums after that, and are working on another one. Experts say the CD will sell less than Bible Adventures. During her time in this band, Gwen would often [[whore]] herself out to her fellow band-mates, including her brother, which would have made for some hot [[incest|incests]] if all the guys in the band weren't [[anal sex|banging each other]] behind the scenes. The fact that the [[fag|fags]] [[anime|dye their hair]] is all the proof in the world you'd need. Eventually Gwen broke off from the group, because she was angry at the band for not letting her at least watch their [[S&M|flamboyant sexcapades]]. 

As a solo artist, Gwen knew she couldn't cut it by doing crappy generic pop songs, so she did the only thing she knew to do; start putting out crappy generic '''[[hip-hop]]''' songs. Just about every song that Stefani makes is about the [[urine|ropes of gold hanging out of her ass]], how [[Sexist|women are better than men]], or about how she's [[DevianTART|artistic and creative]] and [[noone]] understands her. Every song she does will feature some two-bit [[rapper]] to raise her [[Street cred|street-cred]] through the roof, because Gwen will do anything to have her ass pounded by a bushel of black person cocks. The only good thing to ever come out of her music was the [[meme]] "THIS SHIT IS __________", but even that was fail, since it came from people actually listening to her Emu-testicle-shitting quality voice.

==Harajuku Girls==
Gwen likes to claim that the [[cosplay]] freaks in Japan's [[Harajuku]] slum district have inspired her and she's their "biggest fan". Truth is she'd never heard of the Harajuku or the faggy nip retards until she saw an [[MTV]] story about how a bunch of Jap gals were dressing up just like her and selling their twats for crack. She flew over there to see what it was all about, and wound up hiring two of them off the street to appear with her in all her shitty videos and to suck her pussy when she's on the rag. Gwen then wrote a song that took all of three minutes to record that exposed millions of USians to more Jap faggotry, and prompted most historians to agree that we shouldn't have stopped with the nuking of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Japan|Nagasaki]].

==Other Useless Tidbits==
*Gwen keeps her hair pulled back in a tight ponytail in order to counterbalance her nose, which causes her face to sag downward due to its size.
*Stefani was the mentor on the shit-show [[American Idol]] to host the show themed 'Things that Inspired Gwen Stefani'. Apparently her own music inspired her. [[Ego|Egotistical?]] [[Yes|Nooo.]] Pretty much, she had nothing useful to say, and was only there to whore out her album and national tour with lackey [[Rap|Akon]].
*Gwen has a [[fashion]] line for [[baby|babies]] called LAMB, that is devoted to making your one year old look as [[slut|slutty]] as possible. It is Gwen's belief that '...It's just terrible that  today's children are getting so little [[cock]]. So, why not speed up the process and make your children look like fresh, fresh pedo meat? Trust me, they'll thank you for it later on.'
*Gwen had a crackbaby with the lead singer [[Bush|of some band]]. The [[abortion|baby]] was apparently the inspiration for LAMB. No pictures of her scantily clad child exist, since the [[FBI]] would probably bust down her door for it.
*Thanks to her becoming responsible for exposing the world to the Harajuku freaks, Gwen now has an entourage made up entirely of [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] [[Japanese|Japs]] who follow her around, dressed as [[Goth|Gothic]] [[Loli|Lolitas]]. Gwen has drawn criticisms of [[Wapanese]], which she responds to with "OMG THAT IS SO KAWAII!!!!/1" Before shoving sticks of Pocky down her tight-lipped [[ho]] throat. Or is that her rectum? Is there a difference?
