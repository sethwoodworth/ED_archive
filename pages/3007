'''Foetus soup''' (or '''Fetus''', in American Retardese) is a rare [[food|delicacy]] which originated [[at least 100 years ago]] in [[Vietnam]], [[China]] or some other [[Asian]] country. Foetus soup is the only reason [[Tom Cruise]] goes to Asia.

== Ingredients & Preparation ==

To prepare the perfect bowl of foetus soup, you will require the following:

* At least one [[pregnant]] [[female]]
* One wire coathanger
* Being a sickfuck
* Some [[Terri Schiavo|vegetables]]
* Some herbs and spices
* Asian ancestry 

Firstly, [[abortion|procure]] the foetus from the female. It is best to use a coathanger for this, as the standard vacuum-and-grind method of extracting the foetus will mangle it and render it useless for eating. An alternate, should you not have a coathanger, is by using a [[falcon punch]].  You may now discard the empty female.

There is no need to gut the foetus. Place it in a bowl of cold water, and add the vegetables. Next, season with your herbs, salt and pepper, and mix well.

Bring to the boil and let it simmer gently for one hour. The resulting broth with chunks of [[dead babies|dead baby]] may now be [[eat|consumed]] at your leisure, either hot or cold.

== Other Oriental cuisine ==
* Pho
* [[Dogs]]
* [[Cats]]
* [[Dead]] [[army|American soldiers]]

== Discovery ==
Foetus soup was brought to the [[internets]] by [[Colin]], who is noted for eating various fucked up things, not least [[Scotland|haggis]] and baby seal.

Foetus soup also happens to be [[moot|moot's]] favorite soup whenever he is [[Brb, soup]].
