A clone is like an identical twin except it is a genetically identical replica of an original male or female.  Identical twins are identical to each other, with no original.  Some people, those people with a twin, are lucky to have a clone, so that they can study “themselves” in person, but most people are not.  As cloning techniques improve, human clones may become an eventual reality.  As of 2009 clones are merely a source of interest, generating questions such as: “What would my clone do?”, “Would I like my clone?”, and “Would my clone like me?”.    

==Famous Clones:==

* Terry the tadpole: (1952) Many scientists questioned whether cloning had actually occurred and unpublished experiments by other labs were not able to reproduce the reported results.
* Carp: (1963) In China, embryologist Tong Dizhou cloned a fish. He published the findings in a Chinese science journal which was never translated into English.
* Masha the Mouse: (1986) A mouse was the first successfully cloned mammal. Soviet scientists Chaylakhyan, Veprencev, Sviridova, and Nikitin had the mouse "Masha" cloned. 
* Dolly the Sheep: (1996) From early embryonic cells by Steen Willadsen. Megan and Morag[citation needed] cloned from differentiated embryonic cells in June 1995 and Dolly the sheep from a somatic cell in 1997.
* Alpha the Bull and Beta the Bull: were cattle cloned 2001 and 2005
