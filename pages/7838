==Headquarters==
[[Image:Stingray_Head.jpg|thumb|A rare image caught by a spy of the Stingray Headquarters]]
Not much is known about the Stingray Headquarters. Only one undercover agent has ever managed to infiltrate the [[terrorist]] group. The photo to the right being the only information received before he was painfully and horrifically killed by a barb which punctured the heart.

Investigation on the received photograph only revealed a few things.

One, being that the Stingray [[Terrorist]] Organisation obviously have a technology far in advance of our own.

Two, the headquarters also appears to be mobile. This photo was taken near a small town called Swanley in Kent, England. There is no trace of the Stingray Headquaters left. Except some rubble and an old push bike.
