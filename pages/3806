Hurr
[[Image:Hur.png|thumb|250px|right|<center>'''HURRRRRRRRR'''</center>]]
The sound of a [[retard | retarded]] person attempting to [[lol]].  A term used frequently on the [[Something Awful]] forums to denote and emphasize stupidity in the sentence preceeding it, particularly old/stupid humor and the overuse of [[memes]].  It may be drawn out with as many rs as desired, or capitalized for added effect.  The word does pop up occasionally in normal [[IRL]] usage for similar purposes, but has gained "offical" status as [[Something Awful| SA]] lingo due to widespread use there.

== Example Usage ==

Overused [[meme]]: ''"Slapping [[NEDM|Happycat]] onto images is so funny HURR."''

Shitty humor: ''"George Dubya=George DUMBya HURRRRR!!!"''

General use: ''"I'm really still a virgin if I've only been fucked in the ass hurr!"''

Joke to Truth: "''Larry the Cable Guy is HILARIOUS HURRRRR HURRRR HURRR!''"

Tony Abbott: "Stubb-stubb-stubble, fuck"
