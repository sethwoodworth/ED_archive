On [[9/11]]/2006, the nigras did it again.  Filling up the pool and many other rooms, the Habbo mods completely failed.  Lines of proud, black niggers filled the pool area, creating mass havoc for all of the faggot 10 year olds playing the game.  The win is attributed to [[Afroduck|AFRODUCK]], the leader of all nigras, who watches over the pool at all times.


== We Will Not Forget ==

Many /B/rothas were lost in the epic battle, many recieving a permenant IP ban from the hotel. But one thing that is known for sure, we will never stop torturing those fags.  The racist mods will FAIL.

AMEN.

== The Aftermath ==

Even days after the full raid, noble nigras still flooded the hotel, creating another noteable and unplanned block on the 14th.  Apparently, some new faggot mod tried to stop them, only to be showered in DESUs and YOU FAILs.

==BREAKING NEWS [[OMG]]==

It appears now that [[nigra|any well dressed black man]] is getting [[banned]] by TEH MODS. [[Oh noes]]! It appears that this will continue until the mods grow up or /b/ raids the shit out of Habbo such that the mods surrender. Unfortunately, neither has a lead. Disguises to avoid a ban include lolicons, furries (lol), and white wimmenz. Stay tuned for more details.

==Habbo Revisited Revisited==
Habbo Revisited Revisited will take place on October 30th, right before Halloween.

It's after the epic Ebaums raid

It's before Halloween.

/B/lackup is on its way.

On the 30th, a pixelated version of infamous jew Wierd Al will be at the, "Teen People Terrace", at 3PM PST/ 6PM EST to answer questions. Ruination of his stay is mandatory.
