'''{{lj|user=Klerck}}''' was a semi-[[e-famous|famous]] [[Internets]] [[troll]], who ran the shock site Klerck.org, where many of the old standards of the trolling trade, such as [[Lemonparty]], the [[Pain Series]] and spin.gif (which would eventually spawn [[Meatspin.com]]), were mirrored. 

Klerck started a petition to rename ''[[Lord of the Rings|The Two Towers]]'' to something less offensive. The petition read:

"''Those of us who have seen The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring know what an amazing director Peter Jackson is. When I learned that there apparently was to be a sequel, I was overjoyed. However, Peter Jackson has decided to tastelessly name the sequel "The Two Towers". The title is clearly meant to refer to the attacks on the World Trade Center. In this post-September 11 world, it is unforgivable that this should be allowed to happen. The idea is both offensive and morally repugnant. Hopefully, when Peter Jackson and, more importantly, New Line Cinema see the number of signatures on this petition, the title will be changed to something a little more sensitive.''"

This of course caused rabid LOTR [[fanboy]]s to attack, and they struck back with a petition against the petition. Petitionsonline.org eventually took down Klerck's petition, making the Fanboy Petition the first internets petition to actually accomplish something. He was also an anally disgruntled homosexual.

Besides IRC, Klerck was often found posting on forums such as shacknews.com , [[slashdot]] and [[stoofoo]]. His most notable work among these websites was his page widening post exploit on slashdot which caused fustration among the community as they had no way to moderate such behaviour. He was later banned from these websites due to his trolling antics.

On March 8, 2005, Klerck [[suicide|killed himself]] with a shot to the head- but not before first informing the internets! Indeed, he both updated his LiveJournal and chatted on [[IRC]] before offing himself. [[Attention whore]]? We'll let you decide.


A L0de Radio Hour episode was dedicated to the death of Klerck, which can be heard[http://lrh.ww88.org/archives/LRHS2E8%20-%20RIP%20KLERCK%20-%20MORE%20LIKE%20GET%20YA%20DICK%20JERKED.mp3 here]
