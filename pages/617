'''Armed Blowfish''' is an incredibly hot [[Scottish]] woman, currently living in [[Torpark]], [[China]], who enjoys getting [[rape]]d.[http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=11377&st=20] Men rape her again and again and each time she screams with pleasure. However, she is embarrassed of her enjoyment, and tries to cover it up with accusations of victim-blaming.[http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-August/078515.html][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Armedblowfish&oldid=136240411]

== Almost an admin ==
Armed Blowfish ran for adminship on [[Wikipedia]] and lots of men voted for her because she is so [[hot]], but some still opposed because she is a bad bad girl who uses [[Torpark|TOR]]. Hey, thanks for letting me know about TOR! [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=9399]

==Playing hard to get ==
Blowfish may lock the door and put up a barricade to make it hard to get her. A man who surmounts those obstacles will make her feel all warm and fuzzy and loved.

<blockquote>By the time you know the danger you are
in, it is often too late. You hear the sound of someone entering
downstairs...door opening and closing...footsteps...and then the
voice of the man you fear. You don't believe you could run out past
him. There are no ladders to escape out the window. You could
scream, but there's no one around to hear you...and even if there
was, he's a friend of the neighbors.  All of your friends are busy at
this time of day, and you know the police won't be sympathetic...and
even if they did come, they wouldn't come in time. Instead, you check
to make sure the door is locked. It is, but you are afraid that won't
be enough. There's no bolt. All the time you hear footsteps. He
arrives, demands entry, starts proclaiming how hurt he feels. You
tell him to go away. He starts picking the lock, all the time
screaming about how hurtful your refusal to see him is...how he has a
right to see you, touch you...how much he loves you. You try to
barricade the door, but you aren't strong enough to move any of the
heavy furniture. Eventually, he successfully picks the lock and
knocks down the barricade. He blocks the doorway with his body,
perhaps around 300 lbs heavier than you. He continues his insane
banter, even as you yell at him to go away. Adrenaline has been
surging through you bloodstream for some time, making you more
energetic, stronger. Perhaps you can fight your way past. You have
no self defense training, but you manage to jam you knee into his
groin. He bends over a bit, but remains firmly blocking the
doorway...and in a moment he pushes you hard onto the floor, onto the
toppled remains of your barricade, calling you a "sick puppy". Before
you can get to your feet, he drags you onto the bed and pins you down
there, only a bit of thin cloth between his groin and your chest. He
keeps up his banter...how hurt he his...how cruel and evil you
are...how much he loves you...and even starts to cry, all while
keeping you pinned, all while you keep telling him to go away. [http://www.nabble.com/Moving-forward-t4208607.html]</blockquote>

== Now offering FREE BLOWJOBS ==

[[Image:Blo1image.gif]]

Blowfish loves to suck cock and will beg strong men to let her give them [[blowjob]]s. She loves [[cock]] so much she will give a blowjob to anyone, even weak men, just so long as they have cocks. She does full deep throat and swallows the cum. Her [[Gorean|ultimate dream]] is to be enslaved by a powerful man who will rape her every day and sell her body to other strong men.

== The Second Rape ==
Armed Blowfish describes what she called [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-August/078515.html The Second Rape.]  This happened while she was playing ''[[StarCraft]]'' and got an early [[Zerg rush]]. She wasn't happy losing so early in the game so she disconnected her modem so her opponent would get a "draw" instead of a win and she would get a disconnect instead of a loss.
