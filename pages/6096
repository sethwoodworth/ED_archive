"Otherkin.com" is a forum where the most severely mentally ill [[basement_dwellers|basement-dwellers]] congregate to discuss the trials of being [[batshit_insane|a mythical creature in a human body]]. The users of this website claim to be the standard cookie-cutter otherkin creatures, from [[FYIAD|dragons]] to [[twilight|werewolves]] to [[lord_of_the_rings|elves]]. The website hosts a variety of boards where the [[otherkin|board members]] may also discuss more [[no|normal]] things such as [[hentai|anime]], [[wicca|religion]], and [[magick|magic]]. The boards are open membership, which might give the average [[internet_hate_machine|hate-filled internet user]] the perception that the forum is easy to troll. However, this is not the case; users of [[otherkin|otherkin.com]] actually seem to [[masochist|enjoy]] trolls.

==What Horrors Dwell Here?==
The members of Otherkin.com can be broken down into 4 catagories.

==='Real' Otherkin===
[[crazy|'Real' Otherkin]] are the few people on the wretched site who actually, completely, absolutely believe that the are indeed mythical creatures. These lolcows can be easily distinguished by their [[nazi|grammar nazi]] tendancies, [[elitism|elitism]], and their ability to easily admit that they may indeed just be [[insane|insane]] as opposed to a lvl 80 [[dragon|dragon]]. The real otherkin are the most likely to believe themselves [[hipster|obscure]] and even [[ugly]] kintypes. Strangely enough, the real otherkin are the least obnoxious of the four member catagories. 

===Wishkin===
[[hopeless|Wishkin]] are the most [[pathetic]] of the four catagories. A 'wishkin' is a freak of nature who doesn't actually believe that it is an otherkin but pretends to be one in a desperate attempt to be [[goth|unique]]. They comprise the majority of the site and can be identified by their bad grammar and tendancy to label every newcomer 'fluffy'. 75% of wishkin are wolf [[furry|therians]] because [[wolfaboo|wolves are so majestic]].

===Skeptics===
[[the_amazing_athiest|Skeptics]] make up a fairly large chunk of the otherkin.com membership. [[lie|They believe only in the laws of nature]] and vehemently tear down any idea with supernatural elements. Surprisingly, the skeptics get along quite well with the 'real' otherkin. They all are most likely [[closet_furry|otherkin in denial]]. Why else would they be on a forum full of nutjobs, other than the fact that they have no friends IRL?

===Trolls===
[[Trolls]] are trolls. Most of the trolls on ok.com fail miserably because they are obvious. The only way to successfully troll the forum is to infiltrate the member base and start as much drama as possible. While otherkin.com is constantly bombarded by trolling, only a patient, basement-dwelling few have actually succeeded in terrorizing the members.

==Joining Otherkin.com==
How to blend in with the Otherkin.com community:
# Create an account with a fantasy or [[new age|new-age]] sounding name
# Determine what your 'kintype' will be. Extra credit points if you combine your primary kintype with a secondary [[furry|wolf]] type, because [[bullshit|everyone knows that wolves are majestic and beautiful creatures]]
# Post on 'First Retreat' with your kintype. Say you have past-life memories. Remember to offer *cookies*! If you want to do a follow-up, write a novel on the 'Members' History' board about how as a child [[loser|nobody liked you]], and how [[assburgers|you always felt different]]. You'll get a lot of sympathy.
# From there you can spread out to different boards. Remember to relate everything you post back to your kintype.
# After a while, if you aren't banned by the [[nazi|admins]] for some ridiculous reason, you will be accepted by the members and community as a whole. Congratulations, you have no life!

==Fluff Hunting==
A favorite pasttime of Otherkin.com is 'fluff' hunting. A member of the boards will find another otherkin site or forum, post its link in the 'fluff hunting' subforum, and engage in [[bukkake|group ridicule]] of the site and those involved with it. This would be all fine and dandy if the opening page to Otherkin.com weren't a disclaimer that says this:

{{squote|Warning: The following site contains information on the subject of otherkin. This includes vampires, weres, demons, angels, fae, elves and dragons.

This is not a roleplaying site, and the information stored on this site is not to be used in the hunting of vampires or any other type of otherkin. By clicking on "I Agree" you are accepting these terms. Please do not come to the site with a closed mind. There are plenty of people we have to deal with in real life who have the same outlook. This page is designed to share infomation. You do not have to agree with this information, but respect other people's right to learn.

On a personal note, vampires and otherkin rarely attack humans. We have found other ways to live and co-exist. Vampires have gone out of its way to live with the human race with minimal impact on their well being. Now that we have gone out of our way to co-exist, it is time the human race did the same. Forget what you see on Buffy, we might not be the nicest people on the planet, but when you have some psycho with a crossbow trying to "slay" you, we all of a sudden don't think too highly of the human race. And if it comes down to a fight between a vampire and a "slayer," I hope you can run fast...|[[srs|srs otherkin]]}}
How can the [[obese|members]] of Otherkin.com take themselves seriously when their own front page implies that otherkin [[attack]] humans? The most logical explaination is they're too busy masturbating to [[hentai]] read the disclaimer.

==Admins==
The [[admins]] of Otherkin.com are mostly [[twilight|'vampires']] who for some reason decided to create a website for [[FAE_Inc.|fairies]] and [[inuyasha|demons]] instead of remaining where they belong in a [[gothic]] [[twilight|vampire]] circlejerk community. These admins are feared by each and every non-troll member of Otherkin.com and have been known to deal out the [[banhammer]] for petty disagreements. The banned members are listed upon a thread that incidentally happens to be the largest thread in the entire forum. In order to prevent what should be considered an inevitable banning, members suck the admins' [[cock|e-dicks]] on a regular basis. In stark comparison, moderators don't seem to have a purpose upon the forum and can be argued with freely.

==Quotes From Real Mythical Creatures==
<center>{{morphquote|otherkin.com|background-color: #FFFFFF; width: 1000px; height: 200px|font-weight: bold;
|Hey, it's a long story, and people who don't know about theosophy and other related things often laugh when they hear about the dragonwolf, just because, as I was told we're only about 30 in the world. I have no idea if Sapphire is one. Maybe it's just a name coincidence.
Since we're so few there is no community and most people never heard of any of us.

Alexander The Great was one. Jesus was one. An atlantean General was one(for those who believe Atlantis existed). I don't really know many dragonwolves. And since I don't care to prove to the world I am one of them or that they even exist I'll avoid being ridiculed by people who don't know, please understand it has happened a couple of times already :/

The problem is can't quite prove it because I'm still learning about it, and I'm still learning astral travel which will allow me to learn much more about myself. They described my astral body as being a red and black fire dragon with two pairs of horns. The primal energy behind it would be creativity, just like for all fire dragons. A dragonwolf would have a lot in common with other dragons, but also with wolf therians. It's a combination of the two things actually.

Now, my claims have been rejected by people who simply don't have my knowledge.. I mean, if you disagree at least be respectful, that's all I can ask for.| Maddox Dragonwolf informs everyone about the historical significance of dragonwolves.
|Luci...all talk and yeah he's a bitch but i still love him just the same. we talk alot still though not as much as we used to. Gabe. He's a character always has been and again love talking to him. I never could stand michael really but thats personal preference. so now i feel like I can actually be myself about talking to them and not feel totally crazy!|Rubyrose describes her personal relationship with the devil and God's messenger.
|I was made to serve. When I am not serving, my body actually aches. I was the Familiar of some higher being.(possibly a Celestial, but more likely a Higher-Up Demon)
Anyway, I managed t escape for my old master, and found a little nook were I could create a living space. But I still longed to be serve a ward, so I tricked a witch from the physical plane into summoning me, creating a bond, and letting me live with her, do her work, and help her small town (it had fallen to an illness, and, for reasons unknown to me, I had the power to help them heal or something). After many years, she died, and my I returned to my plane. It felt like a million lifetimes of loneliness, not having anyone to serve. I became so sad. But then another Master summoned me. He was a terrible man, ho performed experiments on corpses and summoned evil beings to aid him in his terrible magick. He tortured me with these beings, and never gave me rest (metaphorically speaking). Eventually, I was saved by a girl, who I served for many years, until she left. I have no idea where she went, but, once again, I was alone... So I decided to become a human. I was experimenting with forms, and incarnated into my current body.

you may notice that I didn't mention the whole 'Bran' incident. This is because that part of my history is still pretty foggy.|xxravenohayexx tells everybody about his life as a demon and brings up many questions as to what 'Bran' is and why there was an incident.
|My life has been filled with hatred, misunderstanding, and betrayal. Sometimes to the point of my seeking oblivion. As a child, I was scorned by peers, and then soon scorned even by adults, hated and misunderstood even by my own parents. Even as an adult, I am not part of the flow of human society.|LostSphinx, one of the many suicidal societal rejects that dwell on Otherkin.com.}}
