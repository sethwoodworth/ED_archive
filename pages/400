It is a question which has plagued many a [[troll]] for centuries: Which is funnier - [[racism]] or [[sexism]]?

Amanda Kijera is a professional [[liberal|activist]] campaigning for the rights of women and black people worldwide. When she heard about the [[HAARP|earthquake]] in [[Hæti|Haiti]] she was one of the first to volunteer to help the indigenous population.

Unfortunately for her, the country was made up entirely of niggers with an [[truth|average IQ of 62]]. As a white woman in that situation it was just a matter of time before she got raped and murdered/eaten.

Who was to blame for this brutal nigger raping a women who was only trying to help his people? THE [[White people|WHITE MAN]]!

Apparently out of a need to rationalize the event and make it fit in her world view where niggers aren't animals, [[lol wut|she blamed white men for oppressing the nigger enough to make him go insane and rape her]]. In an amazing turn of events she has become so desperate to fight the power she has collectively trolled even the [[feminazis]].

|I begged him to stop. Afraid he would kill me, I pleaded with him to honor my commitment to Haiti, to him as a brother in the mutual struggle for an end to our common oppression, but to no avail. He didn’t care that I was a Malcolm X scholar. He told me to shut up, and then slapped me in the face.|Malcom X approves of this!
|Stop dividing Black families by distributing solely to women, which only exaggerates male resentment and frustration in Haiti.|Fuck women - that'll stop rape.
|I went to remind them of the many great contributions that Afro-descendants have made to this world, and of their amazing resilience and strength as a people. Not once did I envision myself becoming a receptacle for a Black man’s rage at the white world, but that is what I became.|That's what you get for being an oppressive little cracker slut.
|While I take issue with my brother’s behavior, I’m grateful for the experience. It woke me up, made me understand on a deeper level the terror that my sisters deal with daily.|So technically it wasn't rape at all.
