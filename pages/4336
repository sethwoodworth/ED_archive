Jimbo's Japan Tour, 2007
==The Big Tour==
[[Jimbo Wales]] is visiting Japan from early March to early April of 2007, presumably on Wikifoundation cash. WTF is he doing there? No "meetups" have been announced, there are no press releases, there have been no area-specific announcements. 
Jimbo has made the following statement.

Living and working, LOL. He is obviously either using Foundation money to stay at an extremely expensive hotel or being put up by someone very wealthy, ''gratis'', in the style to which he is accustomed.

===Srs.[[Wikia]] Biz: Most Likely?===
Hypothesis 1: He is there to whip up support, investment, and idiots who'll donate work or cash to his profit-making Wikia and Wikia search-engine businesses.

===Srs [[Wikipedo|Foundation]] Biz===
Hypothesis 2: He is there to try to stop topical edit wars on the local [[wikipedia]].

Hypothesis 3: He is there to try to whip up money for the foundation from the local [[wikipedia]].

Hypothesis 4: The local [[wikipedia]] is trying to break away from the foundation and he is there to try and stop them.

===Holiday===
Hypothesis 5: He has been on a permanent holiday ever since he made fortunes as a [[porn]]-[[king]] and [[Internet]] [[liar|scraper]], but you can't admit [[shit]] like that; this is just more of the same, in a different place.

Despite having a shitload of money, he is lounging around at someone else's expense; now he's also got the rotten breakup with [[Essjay]] to get over.

[[Shit nobody cares about|Who knows]]?
