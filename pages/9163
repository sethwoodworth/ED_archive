[[Image:Uncyclopediapotato.png|thumb|[[B&]] from ED? This is your new [[Hell|home]]!]]
[[Image:What'sthedifference.PNG|thumb|[[None]].]]
So, [[you]] decided you were [[butthurt|sick and tired]] of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and want to move on to other inferior wikis because you were banned for "no reason"? Upon searching for a new home, it is most likely that one who was [[b&]] from ED for their faggotry will migrate to '''Uncyclopedia''' as they feel their [[unfunny|hilarious]] sense of humor is not appreciated here. Fortunately for you, writing an article for [[Uncyclopedia|Hitler's Uncyclopedia]] requires a very [[retarded|intelligent]] variety of satire and [[Lies|takes years of practice, determination and effort]]. Luckily, you just so happen to have all those [[talentless|useful skills]]. Uncyclopedia is the "''content-free wiki''" (<u>example of a common Uncyclopedian joke</u>: More like free content, [[No|amirite]]?) in which "[[shit|content]]" is used to sugarcoat the word "funny", one must adapt to the styling of their writing-method. As ED archives the events of Internet drama, memes, trolling and anything else that generates [[lulz]], Uncyclopedia documents on the [[Shit nobody cares about|significant topics to which no sane human being is aware of or concerned about.]] 

As any [[faggot|Uncyclopedian]] will tell you, Encyclopedia Dramatica is nothing but a [[irony|cheap knock-off]] wiki that's copying Uncyclopedia (fun fact: ED was around before, albeit only about a month older). So everything on their website is [[bullshit|clearly original content]] and ''much better'' than anything on ED.

==Getting Started==
[[Image:Monkeyoncomputer.jpg|thumb|Uncyclopedians are typically [[macfags]]. Most of them aren't human either.]]
[[Image:Wtf is this sht edited.jpg|thumb|The [[typical]] reaction everybody has when stumbling upon Uncyclopedia.]]
In ED, writing an article about some stupid shit about [http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Solomon_Islands_vs_Sandwich_Islands Solomon Islands vs Sandwich Islands] that isn't even relevant to anything will quickly be [[baleeted]] right on the spot. However, on Uncyclopedia, anything goes whether it be about [http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Garnox some made up alien planet] or something in the lines of the [[What|Dodge ball Massacre of 1332]] (there really are articles like that). In a nutshell, the main goal is to write whatever the hell comes of out your massively stretched [[Goatse|anus]]. Additionally, as ED is bias, Uncyclopedia is known for many articles being first-person for added faggotry. As for what to include in your article, the basis for content would be whatever you can generate from [[FGSFDS|smashing your head]] upon the keyboard repeatedly until you either fill the page or go unconscious. Or you could always have a monkey high off cocaine type for you as they make up the majority of users in Uncyclopedia. 

If one word was used to describe their articles and sum up the entire website in general, it would be '''unfunny anarchy'''. It's pretty self-explanatory. 

===What to Write About?===
The [[crap|wonderful]] thing about Hitler's Uncyclopedia is you can write about [[Shit no one cares about|anything!]] And that is no exaggeration; it's literal. You can write about that huge zit on your left testicle named Bobington CriggleJornpuff, or an article of the menacing meditation of infrastructures polluting the galaxy Zenonpotinfdf in the 7th dimension of your marbles. You can even [[Writing yourself into an article|write about yourself]] since Uncyclopedia is about everything that everybody else could care less about. Always remember that the key point of every article in Uncyclopedia is to [[spam]] the shit out of the page with meaningless nonsense until you run out of space that their [[HostGator|nigger]] servers cannot handle.

Another helpful asset concerning about ideas on potential new articles is to look at the heap of all the other shitty articles. The main idea is to [[cuntpaste]] everything from one of their "good" articles (if one can even call it good) but giving it a different title. Remember, you'll need to be [[Not funny|funny]] and not [[irony|just stupid.]]

===Knowing When it's [[Bad Article|Good]]===
[[Image:Very_Ugly_Jew.JPG|thumb|Meet your new [[Jews|sysop]]!]]
Uncyclopedia prides themselves in [[Unwarranted Self Importance|being random, witty, and funny]] and want to [[Unrealistic Expectations|continue]] being good at what they do [[nothing|best]]. And since its [[raeped|approved]] by Wikipedia, [[sarcasm|it must be a good website!]] For every good article by their standards (which is really, really low), the article must contain [[Lies|lotsa TRUFAX]] as well as a detailed explanation on how "[[gay|epic]]" your article is within its respective page and how everything on any other website is an "[[epic fail|<s>fail</s> Epix Fail]] lolololol". When writing an article, you must strive to be exactly like [[Carlos Mencia]] or [[Family Guy]] in which you steal material and [[buttfuck]] it in your own idiotic rendition which drains the comedy dry out of any droplet. Of course, it will appeal to [[13 year old boys]] and [[Frat|frat boys]] drunk off their ass who [[Not gay|deny being gay]] even after licking their best bro's ass. Additionally, if your article doesn't make anybody laugh, fret not as you're clearly doing your job and on your way of getting a featured article!

===Rating System===
The thing Uncyclopedia has that many other Wikis do not is a [[attention whore|rating system]]. The rating system justifies a quicker view of just what others feel about a particular article. To them, the higher the rating the better the article is. But to the rest of the world, the higher the rating the more reasons it'll give you to leave the internet of your [[AIDS]] and [[kill yourself]]. Unsurprisingly, it's not very difficult to achieve a 5-star rating for your article on Uncyclopedia. Just suck some cockz and you're well on your way of earning plenty of 5-stars on all your articles! '''But remember''': any article that is actually funny and relevant to matters that people actually care about will be instantly given 1-stars and it is highly probable that it will get deleted within a week. The reason for this degree of [[Waaambulance|resentfulness]] towards funny articles is that all Uncyclopedians are extrememly insecure and any sign of good content will make them lash out in jealousy and [[nerd rage]].
 
Another useful tip to know about the rating system is learning how to rate all your articles by yourself. If you're having a hard time getting any ratings on your article(and let's face it, you're nobody important) your best bet is to create [[sock puppet|multiple accounts]] on Uncylopedia and rate-spam until you feel like you're somebody important when you're clearly not. Don't forget that you're not the only one using this method; the entire website is along with all the admins. But seeing as the admins control the website, it would be redundant for them to create multiple accounts as they can automagically set their articles to 5-star selfishly like the greedy [[Jews]] they are.
 
And if that doesn't work out, you can always go and [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|blank all the pages]] you see.

==The Know-Hows==
[[Image:Toilet45.jpg|thumb|This is a demonstration of the process of making an article at Uncyclopedia.]]
[[Image:DDEshit.JPG|thumb|This seems to be an ideal candidate to become  a featured article on Uncyclopedia.]]
Simply put, if Uncyclopedia was a cartoon character, it would be [[Milhouse]]. They both sadly think they're hilarious, important and feel they should be taken more seriously yet everyone is too busy to point and laugh at them. Now that you have a basic sense of what to write about you should try to understand what goes in these articles rather than just keyboard smashing. You'll also have to know the fundamental equation that goes with every Uncylopedic article: ''Random gibberish - Humor - Effort + Stupidity (admin dick sucking)= Featured Article''. 

As you proceed, these are basic know-hows you must include in any article down there.

===Quotes===
<code><big>''"Quotes like this are necessarily important in Uncyclopedia "''</big></code><br />
:<code>~ '''[[Jimbo Wales]] on Quotes'''</code>

<code><big>''"Quotes is a sad attempt to make things funny, FOO! "''</big></code><br />
:<code>~ '''[[Mr. T]] on Quotes'''</code>

<code><big>''"The more you have the funnier it is. HAHAHAHAH THAT IS SO FUNNEH"''</big></code><br />
:<code>~ '''[[Oscar Wilde]] on Quotes'''</code>

<code><big>''"Quotes are....what the fuck am I doing here?"''</big></code><br />
:<code>~ '''[[Normal people]] on Quotes'''</code>

===<s>Strikethrough</s>===
<s>Lol, you know what's a really good way of sounding funny? It's when you use strikethrough!! Using strikethrough is more effective to piping because it points out the sarcasm even better. You see, scribbling over something puts emphasis on a joke you tried to tell that your friends didn't understand. Strikethrough is a very underrated joke and only fucktards with no sense of humor won't understand it. Usually, people will fucking yell and stuff like that when you do strikethrough! STRIKETHROUGH STRIKE STRIKETHROUGH!!!! Hey are you still reading this? I get a little lonely sometimes...What was I talking about again?</s>

===Pop Culture Reference===
It worked for [[not funny|hilarious]] shows like Family Guy, so it should work for you too! Be sure to start it off like them too! (i.e. Remember when or Like that time I...)

===[[Trying too hard|One Liners]]===
[[Lies|You need to be a comedian when you're writing!]] Always start your article with one liners as they tend to be the best attention grabber. Nothing like a good ol' [[amirite]] can't do to do the trick. You can also make a pop culture reference and use <s>strikethrough</s> to make your hook even [[worse|better]]. But you want people to think you're even funnier, don't you? Well, if you're running out of [[shit|good material]], you always have some [[Chuck Norris]] jokes to fall back on. [[Humanity|Who doesn't like a good Chuck Norris joke?]]

===Randomness===
[[File:JimboApprovesWdong.png|thumb|[[Truth|Every single Uncyclopedia article in a nutshell.]]]]
[[Do not want|Random, you say? Yeah I said random, you got a problem with that? Ya??? Let's take it to the streets bub!! I like turtles, what about you? My dad has 6 toes, did you know that dooode? Have you ever known how much excess fat a whale has, it can feed an entire ecosystem in the planet Tarnania. Speaking of which, how do you like duck tape cause I like the gray ones. i don't like blackies. So annehwaiz, am I the only one who notices the springs in a bed can make you jump higher? I wuz like "no wai"! My brother is in a fraternity, did you know?]]

[[AIDS|Am I boring? How about now? Is it working now. I got a new fart app on my iPhone last week that I spent $5 on. I like Subway. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW? SDKFJKSLDJFSDKAFJLKL;SDJF SKD;FJSKLJF KSJFSADKOJF OJSADFKOJ? IS THIS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU CAPTAIN? I HAVE VERY GOOD grammer! I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED, DOES IT END WITH AN A OR E? I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE WITH AN E. Oh hey, I forgot about strikethroughs. I'm pretty sure the code is [striekthrough] and with slash point...or is it called dash? I like turtles!!!1one!eleven]]

==Images to Include==
Almost done with your article but still feel something missing? Fear not as all you need to spice up your new article is some [[shock images|pretty pictures]] to add some razzle-dazzle. Since bad images that [[your mom]] don't approve are not allowed, you'll have to think outside the box. Below is a gallery of what to include in every Uncyclopedia article as it relates to everything they're about.

==Uncyclopedic No-nos==

[[Image:Ugly hibbies 2.jpg|thumb|These are what Uncyclopedians usually look like. Please be nice, as they have [[Assburgers]].]]
Despite being the retarded anarchy they are, Uncyclopedia actually does have some rules. For starters, Uncyclopedia claims they are uncensored when they clearly [[Contradiction|do not tolerate]] any kind pornographic or shock images. So that means no [[Lemon party]]...of course if one were to upload [[CP|pictures of little kids playing]] it will remain there for all eternity. Or at least until the [[fbi|FEDS]] come by. They will also tell you over and over again that you're not allowed to state clear [[facts]] such as all black people like [[chikins]] and commit crimes all the time or that women were made for [[secks]] and being [[in the kitchen]]. It's their policy to state false information yet they will also tell you that lies are unfunny which they admittedly say [[Common knowledge|they're unfunny]]. Too bad everyone knew that from the start.

{{quote|[[Unrealistic Expectations|'''The mission of Uncyclopedia is to provide the world's misinformation in the least redeeming and searingly sarcastic and humorous way possible''']]|Uncyclopedia with their wishful thinking|color=red|size=360%|textsize=400%||sourceSize=100%}}

There also happens to be no toleration for [[Internet tough guys]]. As you may or may not know, Uncyclopedia is guarded by the [[Cyber Police]] and cyber bullying will unleash [[consequences will never be the same|consequences that will never be the same]]. So you have to be [[pussy|nice]] and all the articles you write also have to be nice, mmkay :). Additionally, you will also have to show respect for your fellow Uncyclopedian no matter how much of a faggot they are. So no reporting them, [[Kittens|no filling their userpage with various shock images]], no posting hateful comments on a fucktard's user talk page telling them to either stop their stupid bullshit or [[GTFO]], and '''NO NAME CALLING'''!!! Everybody there is very [[autistic|sensitive]] and they must be treated with [[BAWWW|respect.]] You must always have good behavior!
 
Furthermore, there shall be [[no cussing]]. None whatsoever. Since Hitler's Uncyclopedia is a [[Anti-Lulz|SFW]] wiki, there shall be nothing of the like on the website. Never forget, they want to keep things G-rated because anything obscure or offensive is ''being stupid and not just funny''.

==What Happens if My Article gets Deleted?==
[[Image:GodhatesUncyclopedia.png|thumb|[[You|Who in the hell doesn't?]]]]
If you've been following this guide step-by-step, you would generally have no problem. But since [[you]] can't do anything right, even so much as write an article that's good by a shitty excuse for a wiki's standards, you don't have much hope in life. As you were already weren't good enough for ED's standards, you were most likely bad for their standards meaning less faggotry here and more over there. It's a win-win situation. In the event of having your article [[baleeted]], there are only a few options you have to do. But knowing [[you]], you'll just screw this up like you did with everything else in life.
*Declare [[Vendetta]] and [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]]!!
*Give the admins Pie. They do not like [[delicious cake]]
*Submit your deleted article again. Repeat the process if it gets deleted once again until you get banned
*Post some dox
*Upload naked pictures of yourself and post it on as many articles as you can
*Declare [[e-Jihad]]
*Spam [[recent changes]] with minor edits and add "BLANKING IN PROGRESS" IN THE DESCRIPTION
*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

If your attempts of any of the above were all futile (which is no surprise at all), then there is only one [[Final Solution]]. Video tape yourself committing suicide and post in onto their site. It'll definitely bring you the attention you've never deserved.
