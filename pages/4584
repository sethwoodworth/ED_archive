Killchan
{{old}}

'''Killchan.org''' was a short-lived *chan that claimed to be the "[[420chan]] fallout shelter."  It was doomed to [[failure]] from the start for its use of [[Zenofeller|red and green on black text]], shady hosting, and having been run by a [[13-year-old boy]].

Fortunately for the internet, it was quickly invaded and destroyed by nefarious [[pedophiles]] JAYDUB, meatloaf and Aqualung who [[spam]]med the site with [[loli|child models]].

After a while, Killchan's owner's parents found out their son was hosting [[Nude|nekkid]] photos and promptly grounded him from the [[internet]] for [[at least 100]] months.  He put up a laugably false [[FBI]] statement after taking down the site.
