Internet petition
[[Image:Typical_Internet_Petition.JPG|thumb|Typical Internet Petition.]]Did you know [[you|your]] opinion [[lie|really matters?]] Like, [[lie|really?]] [[LIES|Even on the Internet?]] Well, thanks to Internet petitions, it does! By [[anonymous|anonymously]] signing an online petition, you can change [http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/taylorswift/ artists' tour dates], [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=14612150958 gas prices], [http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/all_ages_venue_lexington/ local laws], [http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/FreeIraq military decisions], [http://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/701239440 the Constitution], and even [http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/intlfundp2p/ events in other countries.] Feel the power!

Statistically, 33% of online petitions are about bringing back some obscure [[anime]] series that is [[Shit nobody cares about|truly missed by loyal fans]]. Another 33% of internet petitions are devoted to moral crusades such as [[fag|gay marriage]], [[abortion]], [[weed|legalization of marijuana]], or saving the Clock Tower. The other 33% of petitions are about serious hot button social issues, like [[net neutrality]], [[Tibet]], or [[shit nobody cares about|Darfur]]. The remaining 1% are petitions to give the death penalty to morons who don't realize 33% + 33% + 33% only equals 99%.

Internet petitions are [[serious business|serious, serious, business]]. Only sign them if you truly and sincerely believe in the cause they are trying to promote, because you wouldn't want to give the petionee a wrong impression,  because they do take note. Companies/governments who are petitioned against really pay attention to these petitions. If x number of anonymous Internet people say they believe in this cause, they MUST comply, right?
