Happy wheels

'''[[Happy Negro|Happy Wheels]]''' is a singleplayer motocross game made in [[flash]], notable for it's [[lie|unique]] gameplay, superb [[guro|gibbing]] system, and and ability to create [[funny|humorous]] situations. It's yet another instance of an obscure game instantly becoming popular upon being mentioned by someone who is moderately well-known, it this case [[Machinima|Adam Kovick]]. It is decent as a timewaster, but not deserving of the [[TL;DR|50 page threads]] it has spawned in a number of gaming [[forum]]s.

==Gameplay==

The goal of Happy Wheels is simple: get to the finish alive. You are permitted to lose any nonessential body parts and [[nigga stole my bike|even your vehicle]], as long as you are not killed in the process. A wide variety of deadly obstacles can be found along the way, from everyday deathtraps like spike pits or landmines, to more unconventional things like a giant shotgun or [[satan]]'s mouth. Most people ignore the goal and simply try to get their character killed in [[unfunny|funny]] ways. The controls are fairly standard, with the exception of the ability to let go of the vehicle and subsequently [[Ragdoll Physics|flail around on the floor like a fish out of water]]. If you join and log in to the website, you can save replays of your runs for [[noone|other people]] to see and rate. A popular map in happy wheels [[typical]]ly involve falling off ledges, [[Indiana Jones|running away from a large moving object]], or sitting inside a special vehicle designed to travel down a pre-set path while getting bombarded by wrecking [[balls]].

===Level Editor===
Happy wheels' level editor primarily uses [[ms paint|geometric shapes]] for construction. These shapes can act as a foundation, physics objects, part of a [[series of tubes|series of moving shapes]], or a combination of the aforementioned things. Shapes can be connected by joints, which can either move freely or rotate automatically. Most of the other things are what you'd expect to find in a motocross game, boosters, finish lines, spikes, [[noone cares|etc.]] Most map-makers for Happy Wheels are [[Autism|autistic]] [[basement dweller]]s with the attention span of a goldfish, so expect most of the [[You|User]]-ubmitted levels to be extremely [[boring]] and predictable. To be fair, it's better than the level editors in [[Super Smash Bros|many retail games]]

==Characters==

Happy Wheels currently has 5 playable characters (7 if you count the son and [[girlfriend]]). Each one rides a different kind of vehicle and has up to two riders. There is some variation in how they control, but they are all easy to figure out. Details on each character is listed below.
*[[Epic Beard Man|Wheelchair Guy]] - An old homeless man in a [[LOLWUT|rocket powered wheelchair]]. The rockets can be adjusted and activated to either [[hax|move very quickly or become airborne in places you wouldn't be able to.]] Using him is often considered to be cheating, so he isn't used terribly often. [[and nothing of value was lost|Not that you're losing much from this]], as most replays of the Wheelchair Guy either involve flying to the finish line completely unharmed or slamming into a wall at [[at least 100]] miles per hour.

*[[faggot|Segway guy]] - A suited man on a segway. There is little else that can be said about him, he has no gimmick to speak of. In spite of this, Segway Guy is played fairly frequently.

*[[Josef Fritzl|Irresponsible Dad]] - A guy on a bike with his son. Was the first character to have someone accompanying him, which was found to offer many opportunities to create [[lulz]]y situations. Several maps have been designed specifically for [[awesome|riding off a ramp and tossing your son into a basketball hoop]].

*[[man the harpoons|Effective Shopper]] - A [[fatass]] riding in a powered shopping cart full of groceries. Tends to either be the easiest or hardest character to play as depending on the map, due to the [[fat|size]] of both the character and the vehicle.

*[[Date rape|Moped Couple]] - The first new character to be added to the game, Moped Couple is another pair of characters on a bike. This time the second rider is normally sized, [[An Hero|but she will tightly cling onto her boyfriend even when he is dead and the bike is heading straight into a pit of death]]. Has a weakened version of the Wheelchair guy's rocket boosters instead of a jump.
