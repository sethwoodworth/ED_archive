'''Leonassan''', born [[Christopher Walken]], 16 November [[1984]] is an [[attention whore]] emo [[tard]] who frequents the [[Portal of Evil#POE-News|PoE News]] forums. His [[emo]] ramblings and penchant for self-hurt have become his trademarks, and he constantly and incessantly whines about how his daddy touched his special no-no place [[last Thursday]].

He claims to have had a life that is so fucking [[TL;DR]] that he felt inclined to [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|create a thread all about him]] which [http://www.caltrops.com/pointy.php?action=viewPost&pid=419 oozes originality].

In his full autobiography, he reveals shocking seekrits including:
----
*''First grade was where the trouble started. For starters, my first grade teacher was a very old woman who probably should have retired years before, but was still teaching because she wanted to get her full pension, about halfway through the school year she lost her mind and stabbed another student with a pair of scissors, I remember hiding under the desk but not much else about that. We got a new teacher after that. I also remember getting in trouble for taking a bunch of the faceplates off the wall sockets and for hiding in a cabinet when the teacher was looking for me.''
*''I was sexually molested by several pre-teen to teenage boys. They talked a few of my friends and I into playing a "game" with them. They called it "the gross game" (anything "gross" is instantly interesting to a 6 year old boy, I guess) and it initially consisted of playing with/touching each other's genitals, and slowly progressed to worse things. About the time they demanded I suck them off (I didn't know what that meant at the time, but I do now, obviously) I refused. Which got me stuck in a trash can which they also stuck a hose into and put the lid on, and then sat on the lid, and I was told that I was either going to do what they wanted or they were going to drown me. In my defense I held out as long as I could but eventually I gave in and, at the age of 6 years old, sucked 4 pre-teens and teenagers off in my parent's back yard.''
*''...my dad caught me and one of the boys in my closet (har har, fags in the closet!) with no pants on. I got drug out to the garage and beaten for hours until I finally caved and told them what was going on, they tried to tell the parents of the older boys about this but they got "Well, MY child would never do that", and when I was taken to a psychologist to see if they could get evidence for a suit, they did the whole "Show me on the doll where they touched you" and I just kept making fart noises and laughing.''

After he published his e-book about shit [[noone]] gives a fat flying fuck about, noone wanted to have anything to do with a [http://www.poe-news.com/forums/sp.php?pi=1001245037 perverted pale-faced geek like him]-which was just totally predictable.
