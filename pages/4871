===LIONSGATE'S GAME===
<br>
The best Saw series thread in the history of the internet<br>
<br>
Hello, my friends in Saw. It's your friend, Hrodulf, (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw),<br>
here to rap at you about your favorite movies for a little bit. You know which ones<br>
I mean.<br><br>
'''Here you see the sad wannabe troll's first failure, assuming the persona of the movie'''<br>
'''he is mocking.  Good going [[faggot]]'''<br>
<br>
Here's my excellent Saw 4 "theory." Jigsaw and Dr. Gordon are both<br>
in it, and the movie is nothing but them (offensive sexual reference deleted)ing<br>
each other for three hours. You all can (offensive masturbatory reference deleted)<br>
to it and you will (offensive ejaculatory reference deleted) so hard your (offensive<br>
testicular reference deleted) will dry up and fall off.<br><br>
'''Lol, repressed faggot'''<br>
<br>
I predict my vision for Saw 4 will be the best entry in the Saw Series to date.<br>
<br>
'''Hm, this one is truth'''<br><br>
If you respond to me, and I think it's stupid (which it probably will be, but<br>
no offense, have you guys been reading the garbage you've been posting in here<br>
lately?) I'll print your idiotic (offensive excretory reference deleted), laugh<br>
at your stupidity, grammar and spelling, (offensive urination reference deleted)<br>
and (offensive excretory reference deleted) on it, photograph it, and e-mail the<br>
picture to you. If you respond, better give me an e-mail address or some other way<br>
to get it to you. Otherwise my trap will be even worse. I'll upload it somewhere<br>
else and put the link in the forum, so everyone can laugh at what I did to you.<br>
<br><br>
'''God how many things are wrong with this guy?'''<br><br>
Still want to respond to this? Be careful. I might think it's stupid. If what<br>
you say to me doesn't make sense, you might have a problem.<br>
<br>
And give me a way to send you that photograph. It's for your own good. Otherwise,<br>
everyone will see it also, not only you. And who knows where else I'll upload<br>
it. Lots of websites. Have you been counting them? That's a good job for some<br>
of you idiots to try to do. It will keep you happy for years.<br>
<br>
Have I pwned you guys yet? You want more? Dying for that photograph? Should I e-mail<br>
it or post the link in here? You decide.<br>
<br><br>
'''Like that was going to work.  Who would give their e-mail address'''<br>
'''to a retarded little boy playing at being a troll?  Idiot!'''<br><br>
Please respond. I'm so lonely. And I need some idiots to talk to. And there's<br>
plenty of them on this forum. In fact, I think there are definitely too many.<br><br>
'''Yeah, you were in there Hrodulf, so there was one too many at least'''<br><br>
<br>
Let the game begin!<br>
<br>
Your best friend in Saw,<br>
<br>
Hrodulf (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw)<br><br>
'''What a horrible faggot.  This is the faggiest thing I have ever seen anyone say on the internet'''<br><br>
<br>
(REAL LIFE JIGSAW HAS BUMPED THIS THREAD.  HE PWNS ALL OF YOU).<br><br>
'''Um, only in his overactive imagination'''<br><br>
<br>
(by the way, this is the first time I have ever bumped a thread on this forum in<br>
my life, and probably the first thread that was actually worth bumping.  I regularly<br>
laugh at my (offensive posterior reference deleted) off at the (offensive excretory<br>
reference deleted) you morons bump sometimes.  And this is also the first thread<br>
that there is a justifiable reason to bump, since it will never be responded to.<br>
I'll bump it every now and then.  It will be fun.  Do you like my trap?  Am <br>
I a good Jigsaw?  Have fun on my forum.  I know it says Lionsgate, but I am the <br>
actual person in charge here.  If you have any complaints about the place, please<br>
bring them to me.  But be careful.  I might (offensive urinary reference deleted)<br>
and (offensive excretory reference deleted) on them if I think they're whiny,<br>
stupid, or just don't like them.  And I'll take a picture.  And you know<br>
what I'll do with that picture.  Thank you for reading my threads and getting<br>
pwned.  And you didn't like master1 and KenJIxxx's pwnage, all you did was<br>
complain about it even though it's just words on the internet.  Do you like <br>
my pwnage better?  I have a different style, but I think theirs is also good.  Just<br>
because I like Salvador Dali doesn't mean that I can't like Picasso too.)<br><br>
'''TL;DR, ever hear of paragraphs?  Probably not, loser'''<br><br>
<br>
Food for thought.  Not that any of you think, or really have a valid justification<br>
for continuing to eat, either.<br>
<br>
Your best friend in the entire world,<br>
<br>
Hrodulf (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw).<br>
<br>
[OH AND THE THREAD I WAS TRYING TO BUMP DISAPPEARED.  IT'S LUCKY I HAVE ALL <br>
MY THREADS THAT COUNT BACKED UP ON MY HARD DRIVE.  IT'S VERY FUNNY HOW THINGS<br>
JUST DISAPPEAR ON SAW FORUMS SOMETIMES.  ARE YOU LAUGHING AT THIS?  I SURE AM].<br>
<br>
[HUFF MORE OF MY THREADS.  I'LL PUT THEM ON ANOTHER SITE AND LINK THEM ALL TO<br>
WHEREVER I WANT.  GO AHEAD, I WANT YOU TO DO IT.  I AM REAL LIFE JIGSAW, AND YOU<br>
ARE PLAYING MY GAME, LIONSGATE.  DO YOU LIKE MY GAME?  YOU KNOW THE RULES ALREADY.<br>
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.  AND GIVE ME YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESSES ALSO.  YOU KNOW WHY I NEED<br>
THEM].<br>
<br>
It amazes me you can make a movie about people getting torn apart for no reason,<br>
with no chance to escape their traps, and you can't deal with some words on <br>
a website.  Is my thoughtcrime too much for you?  Read 1984 lately?  You are the<br>
inner party, the thought police, and big brother and many other things.  And I think<br>
that's funny.  Compare your movies to what you are in real life.  Compare what<br>
I am in real life to your movies.  Like the comparison?  I do.<br><br>
'''Ok, I'll make the comparison.  They're movies and you're retarded.'''<br>
'''Like the comparison?  I do.'''<br><br>
<br>
Have someone call me sometime, I love to talk to idiots.  It's what I do all<br>
day in this stupid forum.  Ban me also.  You know what will happen if you do that.<br>
<br>
Have fun watching Saw 4, Dr. Gordon fans.  That was a present just for you.  Will<br>
you watch it?  I won't.  I think I want to commit suicide just because I watched<br>
Saw 3 two times.  I need therapy.  Do you think I can sue Lionsgate for the bill<br>
for the therapy?  I need a lawyer.  Wait, I am a lawyer.  Ok, cool.  I'll look<br>
into if I can do that.<br>
<br>
Let the game begin! (I'm not the repeating myself, this is the "can I sue<br>
you for making the worst movie in the history of the world" game.  This is <br>
my game.  Will my lawyer powers pwn Lionsgate?  Let's see if I can file the <br>
stupidest lawsuit in history and waste the money on buying an index number).<br>
<br><br>
'''Why did you waste four hours of your life writing this shit?'''<br><br>
You know who I am by now.<br>
<br>
'''Yeah a faggot attention whore'''<br>
<br>
Hrodulf (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw)<br>
<br>
===SKYLAR (AN SAWIRLFAG)'s GAME===
<br>
'''HRODULF'''<br><br>
Hello my friends. I am not being a dope. ('''YES YOU ARE''')  I consider<br>
all of you my friends, even though some may not like me ('''MAYBE IT'S'''<br>
'''BECAUSE YOU'RE RETARDED'''). I even like our flamers, master1 and<br>
KenJIxxx, because ('''I'M A FAGGOT''') even with all their flaws, they are<br>
still people. Which I think some of you have forgotten.<br>
<br><br>
'''SKYLAR'''<br><br>
I've not forgotten they are people. I've also not forgotten things they've<br>
said about my innocent family. People have to earn my friendship and the way to <br>
get there isn't to wish that my son gets murdered.<br><br>
'''HRODULF<br><br>
I didn't mean you, Skylar. And it amazes me that out of everything I wrote here,<br>
this is what you chose to comment on. But I understand. It's ok.<br>
<br>
Did you like my story? I'm still writing it. Got any good ideas?<br>
<br>
Hrodulf (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw)<br><br>
'''SKYLAR'''<br><br>
I've not read it yet. I'm still in class and I can't just stop typing<br>
notes long enough to read it all right now. I shall read it later.<br><br>
'''HRODULF'''<br><br>
Ok Skylar, I didn't need to know all that though.<br>
<br>
Sorry, though. I like you Skylar. You are one of my best friends on this forum. <br>
And you know that I accept people of all sexualities. I think it's important<br>
to be open minded about sexual diversity and am excited to be living at the dawn<br>
of a more enlightened attitude towards GLBT people after two millenia of ignorance,<br>
barbarism and stupidity.<br>
<br><br>
'''Told you he was a fag, I called it'''<br><br>
<br>
I'm sorry, your husband's name escapes me right now. Could you tell him <br>
I said hello? I would like to meet him also. He must be a wonderful person. I also<br>
love my wife very much.<br>
How much do you love your husband, Skylar? What would you give up for him? Tell <br>
me, I'm curious.<br>
<br>
Hrodulf (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw)<br><br>
'''SKYLAR'''<br><br>
I would give my life up for my husband and my children.<br>
<br>
Skylar<br><br>
'''HRODULF'''<br><br>
I'm glad to hear that, Skylar. I also would give up my life for my wonderful<br>
wife. Hopefully we will never have to. We should enjoy our lives. Every day is a<br>
good day, Skylar.<br>
<br>
Even over the internet, I can detect some drama in your responses to me, although<br>
I've said nothing but nice things to you. Do you want me to write a story called<br>
"Skylar won't leave my house!" and post it all over the internet? <br>
I'll do it, you know. And it will be (sexual reference deleted by the MPAA) <br>
hilarious. Tell me your husband's name. He's going to be in the story too.<br>
<br>
I'll make you both comedy stars if you don't start being nicer to me. I <br>
am in charge here now. If you and your husband don't want to be the next Cheech<br>
and Chong, in a hilarious story I am equipped to write about you, post it all<br>
over the internet, and link it to this forum so everyone can laugh at what I did<br>
to you, you'll have to be much nicer to me than you're being now.<br>
<br>
Be nice. Or pay the consequences.<br>
<br>
And don't complain. I have the right to write a story about you if I want. Ever<br>
read the constitution? I can change the names if it bothers you that much. Or you<br>
could just sue me. That would be even funnier, I'll write a story about that<br>
too.<br><br>
'''Get the faggot net, this is the worst faggot we've ever seen on the internets.'''<br>
'''He's actually more of a faggot than the real fag Skylar who is irl homogay'''<br><br>
<br>
Get the picture, Skylar?<br>
<br>
Please be nice to me. For your own sake.<br>
<br>
Your best friend,<br>
<br>
Hrodulf (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw)<br><br>
'''SKYLAR'''<br><br>
I would never involve you or your wife in anything I wrote so I think I should be<br>
granted the same courtesy.<br>
<br>
Skylar<br><br>
'''HRODULF'''<br><br>
That's exactly what I want, Skylar. Courtesy.<br>
<br>
Be nice. You're playing one of my games now, by the way. Can you be nice to <br>
me?<br>
<br>
Let's find out.<br>
<br>
Let the game begin!<br>
<br>
Hrodulf (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw)<br>
<br><br>
'''IT'S A MOVIE IT ISN'T REAL YOU MOUTH BREATHING SPECIAL EDUCATION FAGGOT'''<br><br>
<br>
===THE TWO GAMES COME TOGETHER===
<br>
Lionsgate, I've decided to be nice. Skylar is in one of my traps also:<br>
<br>
You can help each other out. Try to escape from your traps together. I'll make<br>
up more rules later. I'm busy and need to make dinner. All of you have been <br>
pwned by some random guy from New York. Including a multi-trillion gajillion<br>
dollar movie company. Too bad all their money can't buy them my brain. It's<br>
mine and it's not for sale. It has sentimental value for me.<br>
<br>
Ban me Lionsgate, please, I'm begging you. I want you to lose my trap. By sacrificing <br>
youself, you can save Skylar. He's suffering.<br>
<br>
Make your choice Lionsgate. Save Skylar? Do you like him enough? Is he worth saving?<br>
<br>
Let the game begin (um, again, because it's a new game now).<br>
<br>
And pretend you're in that crappy washroom, so this is all more realistic for<br>
you. I hope you like my games. You should make this into a movie. It would have <br>
been better than Saw 3 was.<br>
<br>
Pay attention, since I could post more rules at any time. Careful. Watch this thread.<br>
And ban me. Come on, do it. I want the ban. I'm trying to set a record for websites<br>
I've been banned from.<br>
<br><br>
'''Are you trying to set a record for being a faggot too?  Because you already did, you can stop now'''<br><br>
<br>
Your dearest friend,<br>

Here's some new rules for your game, Skylar. You're in the washroom from Saw I with<br>
Lionsgate. You're both my prisoners in this ridiculous forum, which is more <br>
disgusting to me than that stupid washroom in that sewer was. It smells worse in<br>
here also.<br>
And the new rules:<br>
<br>
===THE NEW COMBINED GAME : LIONSGATE VERSUS SKYLAR IN THE WASHROOM FROM SAW I===
Ok, Lionsgate, I'm back. I gave my wife dinner. Here are the final instructions<br>
for this game. I will also post it into Skylar's thread, and pm it to him. It<br>
wouldn't be fair if he didn't know the rules.<br>
<br>
Skylar, you can save a movie company from being publically humiliated on the internet<br>
by leaving this Saw 3 forum forever and never coming back. I am sick of hearing <br>
about your family. I have nothing against your family, like master1 and KenJIxxx<br>
do, but I'm sick of hearing about them and all the drama. The soap opera you're<br>
starring in on here, with master1 and KenJIxxx as the wacky neighbors is officially<br>
over. I'm ending it. Don't worry, there are other places for you to go online.<br>
<br>
You can come back when Lionsgate makes a Saw movie about your family. master1 and<br>
KenJIxxx will probably buy about ten million tickets to it.<br>
<br>
Will you save Lionsgate, Skylar? Let's find out.<br>
<br>
You're both in that washroom now, Skylar, you and Lionsgate. They can save you<br>
from your trap by banning me, but banning me triggers their trap, which is I post<br>
this trap wherever I want and link it here. You can save them, Skylar. Come on, <br>
step up to the plate, they need your help here. They're too stupid to save themselves<br>
from me.<br>
<br>
You can end it all Skylar. Or you Lionsgate. Make your choice.<br>
<br>
Having fun playing my games, the two of you?
<br>
By the way Skylar, I forgot, if you leave and save Lionsgate, but come back later,<br>
I write that story about your family. But it won't be Skylar won't leave<br>
my house, it will be Saw 4.<br>
<br>
And I'll pm it to master1 and KenJIxxx.<br>
<br>
Am I a good Jigsaw, Skylar? Why aren't any of you guys responding to me? Usually<br>
you morons can't keep your hands off your keyboards spewing idiocy. How about<br>
you, Lionsgate. Do you like my trap? Will it be in the next movie? Maybe if you <br>
ban me I can make the movie with puppets and put it on youtube. Come on, ban me.<br>
Make me an internet star. Pwned.<br>
<br>
Have fun playing my games! You're very good test subjects and I played the both<br>
of you like nintendo 64.<br><br>
'''NINTENDO 64?  I bet you unlocked every level of Mario64, in'''<br>
'''between masturbation sessions to Playgirl.  FAGGOT'''<br><br>
<br>
Later, I need to have dinner. I'm hungry.<br>
<br>
Hrodulf (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw) <br>
<br>

===THE END===
<br>
Lionsgate and Skylar are in the washroom RLJ<br>
<br>
Pwned.<br>
<br>
Whatever happens I win.<br><br>
'''NO WHATEVER HAPPENS YOU FAIL'''<br><br>
<br>
Come on guys, make your choice. I don't have all day. How long this trap goes<br>
on for is up to the both of you. Maybe you should have a chat. It should be on the<br>
forum though. It's much funnier that way, don't you think?<br><br>
'''ANYTHING WOULD BE FUNNIER THAN MORE OF YOUR RETARDED PRETENDING TO BE JIGSAW AND DISPLAYING WHAT A FAGGOT YOU ARE'''<br><br>
<br>
Pwned. I just felt like saying it again.<br><br>
'''ONLY FAGGOTS SAY PWNED NOOB'''<br><br>
<br>
This trap is dedicated to master1 and KenJIxxx. And my grandmother<br>
I love you and miss you, Grandma.  I hope to see you in heaven<br>
where there are no idiots. They're all in hell, which is this stupid forum.<br><br>
'''Actually the forum is probably a good representation of what hell is like so he got some truth there'''<br>
<br>
Later guys, make up your damn minds already. Assuming you have any between the two<br>
of you.<br><br>
'''You sure don't have one'''<br><br>
<br>
Hrodulf (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw)<br>
<br>
Ok, guys, let me give you another choice.<br>
<br>
Skylar, you don't leave, and Lionsgate, you don't deletexor any of my posts<br>
or ban me. You know why. The game will never end, there's no time limit, so <br>
effectively, I will be a god here and more powerful than the mods. As I always was,<br>
really.<br><br>
'''LOL NO COMMENT NECESSARY'''<br><br>
<br>
It's sort of funny how you brought this all on yourself. I'd say Pwned again,<br>
but I'm sick of saying that. It's really stupid. Even when it's true.<br><br>
'''How did they bring this upon themselves?  Jesus you are really just fucking Ed Gein level crazy'''
<br><br>
Maybe we can get around to talking about Saw in this forum now, instead of stupid<br>
garbage and Skylar's family. I don't think this should be the Skylar's<br>
family forum, do you? Apparently Skylar does, however. I wonder why that is.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I'm in charge now.<br><br>
'''LOL UNWARRANTED SELF IMPORTANCE ALARM JUST WENT OFF'''<br><br>
<br><br>
Talk to you again soon,<br>
<br>
Your friend in Saw,<br>
<br>
Hrodulf (a.k.a., Real Life Jigsaw).<br>
<br>
P.S. By the way, Skylar, don't forget about your original game. That hasn't<br>
ended yet. You still have to be nice to me, or your family stars in Saw 4 for the<br>
immense enjoyment of master1 and KenJIxxx. I improvised this entire trap on the <br>
fly and ensnared you and a major movie company like little insects in my web, and<br>
I am the spider. Imagine what I could do to you and your family. I could even let<br>
master1 and KenJIxxx help me write it. I'm sure they would find some extremely<br>
creative ways to make you all suffer. They have a lot of motivation! That's <br>
all a good writer really needs, did you know that?<br><br>
'''In your case, extreme stupidity is all a faggot writer really needs'''<br><br>
<br><br>
Don't worry, I'll make up all new, better traps than this one for your family if you break<br>
my rules. I'm a very creative person.  And I think this will be a much better<br>
forum now, with me in charge of it, don't you?<br><br>
'''No.'''<br><br>
<br><br>
Don't worry, I'll be a benelovent dictator. I'm new at ruling people,<br>
so if I'm abusing my power, let me know. Don't worry about that disgusting<br>
stuff about going number 1 & 2 on your posts. I was just kidding that time. <br>
That's too much effort for too little reward for me. I just needed for you idiots<br>
to not respond to my posts so I could play my game with Skylar and Lionsgate without<br>
being interrupted by stupidity.<br><br>
'''The first intelligent thing said by Hrodulf in this entire transcript'''<br>

Oh, and Lionsgate, I forgot one little thing. I remember reading weeks ago there<br>
was talk about wiping this forum out.<br>
<br>
Do I need to tell you what will happen if you do that without my permission? Better<br>
bookmark youtube, I'll give you advance publicity for Saw 4. And it will be <br>
free! Aren't I kind?<br>
<br>
Do I really need to sign this post?<br>

'''FAGGOT FAGGOT FAGGOT FAGGOT FAGGOT FAGGOT FAGGOT!!!!!!!'''<br>

==Commentary conclusion==
'''Wow.  What a stupid little faggot.  There's just no words.  I'm looking for words but I can't find them.  Let's analyze this goat fuck:

1)He pretended to be Jigsaw<br>
2)He mildly annoyed some forum mods, and thinks that means he "owned" Lionsgate<br>
<br>
That's all I can think of I'm too disgusted by this faggotry right now.  I'll add more later but feel free to add more explanations of why this is so fail in this section.  Thanks.<br>
