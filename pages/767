BNF
=Big Name Fan=

Someone who is so active in [[fandom]] that their name becomes famous &mdash; well, among fans, at least.  Basically, the fandom version of the [[Internet celebrity]], although the term originated [[IRL]].

Sometimes BNFs have a devoted following of [[fangirl]]s.  BNFs are often a focal point of [[wank]] and [[drama]], usually because of said fangirls.
