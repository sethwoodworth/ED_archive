'''Scumbag Steve''' is one of the newest [[memes]] that originated from [[4chan]]'s /[[b]]/ section not too long ago in Janurary 2011. The meme started out as just another cancerous [[advice dog]] (or just another unfunny [[image macro]]) variation of a [[wigger|white mac-daddy, Hip-hoppinit Gangsta pimp]] named Steve with his baseball cap worn sideways. Most pictures of him had something along the lines of him saying something that would seem "cool" and "hardcore". Of course, this is no surprise as there hasn’t been anything good coming from 4chan [[Truth|since the day it launched]]. Although at first, it seemed like another unsuccessful yet [[bad|good]] attempt at creating a meme, it happened to spark a [[shitstorm]] on [[Reddit]]. Thus from the [[Shit nobody cares about|nothingness]] it was on /b/ it became quite a popular topic on Reddit.

Now many variations of Scumbag Steve have been created with most of them originating from various members on Reddit. This, however, has actually spurred out some [[unfunny|hilarious]] versions of the original image much like how people on [[tumblr]] splurge out [[forced memes]] because [[Lies|they’re so funny]]. Since then, there has been other images used of some wanna-be rapper who didn't do much to deserve the shit he's getting around the internet.

Even a [[furry]] version of Scumbag Steve exist.

==The Real Steve==

The origins of Scumbag Steve actually come from a [[rapper]] whose name is actually [[whitey|"Boston Blake"]]. The images originated from his [[MySpace]] music account (lol, who still uses that?) which  one of the originals coming from the album cover of his [[shit|hit]] album "Ma Gangsta". On da mic, Steveo goes by the name '''"Weezy B"''' and his group go by the name of '''Beantown Mafia'''. Apparently, the only person in the Beantown Mafia is just Boston [[Loneliness|himself]]. Of course this will change [[Unrealistic Expectations|when his album will go triple platinum and make tons of money]] just like many of the other [[Lies|successful]] MySpace music bands.

===His Career===

Though he may seem like a [[gay|charming]] person, Weezy B really didn’t do anything to reach the attention for people to make a meme out of him. Besides looking like a total [[douchebag]], he hasn’t caused much drama like other [[lolcows]] on the internet. With the sudden growth in popularity and becoming an [[e-celebrity]], many people have tried contacting him and wanting to know more about him in order to exploit him more to further expand the meme. There have also been people who’ve tried pushing him to do an AMA.

[[IRL]], Boston Blake is yet another kid hustlin’ on da cold hard streetz in da suburbz, feel meh? He even talks with [[ebonics]], both [[OTI]] and in his [[Basement|comfort zone]] outside the internet. On MySpace, he happens to only have [[No friends|43 friends]] at the moment (most being other MySpace artists who practically add anybody) and no current concerts (if anyone would dare going to it). As of now, he is independent rapper, though it is [[No|highly likely]] that he could get signed into a major record label considering it doesn’t take much effort to become a rapper.

==Drama==
[[File:Scumbagsteve1.jpg|thumb|120px|Why is this no surprise?]]
Like stated before, as soon as word hit of this meme, it became talked about everywhere on Reddit and on /b/. With this delicious opportunity, many underagedb&s felt they could [[troll]] the hell out of this guy. Like whenever a popular meme emerges, those with [[No life|a lot of time on their hands]] began finding whatever they could about Scumbag Steve whether it be his music, images, or potentially lulzy quotes.

That, however, didn’t go as planned considering that Scumbag Steve’s MySpace account was inactive since 2008. But to no avail, those who [[USI|wanted to go down in internets history as successful trolls]] didn't stop there. And thus the ever expanding onslaught of image macros and advice dog spin-offs began plaguing in Reddit, Tumblr, and even the [[The cancer that is killing b|remaining cancer]] that is /b/.

===The Harassment===

Much like how tumblr got with [[Jessi Slaughter]], Reddit began trying to get cheapshots at Scumbag Steve. From adding him as a friend on MySpazz, to posting his music on [[JewTube]], all were just pitiful attacks. Most weren’t aware of his inactivity, so a lot of the hateful comments and attempted trolling were pretty much for nothing. Although the meme has been making quite a name for itself, it hasn’t been determined whether or not if the real Weezy B is aware of all of this, but this doesn’t seem to bother others. As many intend to troll him, a few others have started threads on 4chan claiming to be Steve and rage in the style of the [[So cash]] meme. There have also been [[raids]] being planned of the sorts as well. 

==His [[earrape|Music]]==
Just like any other rap song, Scumbag Steve's music is [[Typical|pretty much garbage]]. As of now, there only seems to be 1 song on his profile titled "We get a lot of it" (misspellling "A lot" as "Alot" to show how gangsta he is). Much of it, if one can bear through the entirety of the song, is pretty much any other rap song in which he brags about the riches, ho's, and drugs he claims to have. There seems to be quite a few people on YouTube who create unfunny parodies of Scumbag Steve's raps. That, however, is typical when a meme starts rising. Expect there to be boring rants of how much of a "wigger bitch" he is by YouTube nobodies in the near future.
