Anti-Goatse Law
[[Image:Hello.jpg|thumb|left|Pictures of my wedding]]{{elaw}}

The law passed by [[W]] and the [[Republican]]s that goes a little like this:

Chapter 110 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after section 2252B the following:
(a) Whoever knowingly uses a misleading domain name on the Internet with the intent to deceive a person into viewing material constituting obscenity shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both. 

(b) Whoever knowingly uses a misleading domain name on the Internet with the intent to deceive a minor into viewing material that is harmful to minors on the Internet shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 4 years, or both. 

(c) For the purposes of this section, a domain name that includes a word or words to indicate the sexual content of the site, such as “sex” or “porn”, is not misleading. 

(d) For the purposes of this section, the term “material that is harmful to minors” means any communication, consisting of nudity, sex, or excretion, that, taken as a whole and with reference to its context— 
(1) predominantly appeals to a prurient interest of minors; 
(2) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors; and 
(3) lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors. 

==Which basically means==
If you click on this picture of the [[goatse|Channel Tunnel]] then I go to jail! Sucks to be the [[GNAA]] I guess. But it's still legal to post the link without telling people what it is, as long as you use the name Goatse.cx, which has a part that sounds like sex in it so it's okay.

==Holmes is on the case==

Fortunatly 225B is only four doors away from 221B on the Baker's Street (thats Holmes's yard), so this whole thing should be cleared up post haste what.
