Clear Channel
[[Image:Clearchannelbillboard.jpg|thumb|Clear channel uses [[boob shots]] to spread its reign of terror.]] 
'''Clear Channel''' is a [[shit]]ty corporation that's killing [[old media|radio, television]], and [[pirat ponton]].  They own about 15% of all radio stations in the [[United States]] (which, using [[liberal]] [[statistics]], means about 95%) and a bunch of venues and billboards, so it is difficult to live a Clear Channel-free lifestyle.  

==A Clear History==

Clear Channel (or CC) was founded during the disco era of the 1970s.  A superfreak by the name of [[John Travolta]] bought a couple [[Texas]] radio stations in order to distribute disco propaganda to the masses.  In no time, he became [[rich and beautiful]] and bought a whole bunch of radio stations.  Sadly, he kept playing disco music and irritated a lot of [[liberals]] in the process.

==Drama Channel==

Since CC has [[conservative]] leanings and represents what many believe is wrong with so-called [[old media|media]] consolidation, it causes a visceral reaction amongst liberals.  Be sure to mention their political history and how few stations they own, because liberals hate [[fact]]s.

For added [[lulz]], let them know that CC distributes the liberal talk show station.  You could make [[azad_slide]]'s head explode in a [[marquee]] of [[fucktarded]]ness!
