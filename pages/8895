Originally called ''The shorthanded skirmish against illegal substances which may or may not cause harm to somebody'', the '''[[war]] on [[you|drugs]]''' is a US [[lie|war]] waged by [[the man]] for [[lulz]] and [[booze]] [[money]], initially on smelly pot smoking [[hippies]] in the mid 70s in the hope of turning them from [[lulzy|useless]] hippies that spend all their welfare money on imported drugs into [[yuppies|useless]] [[Your Mom|yuppies]] that spend all their easy earned money on imported furniture from [[Europe]] and [[Japan]].

The war on drugs was later described by graduates of the [[common knowledge|school of friggin obvious]] as "''...a slutty waste of public funds which could have been better spent on [[drugs|oversized golden calves]] dropped randomly by stealth bombers over [[Canada]]''."

== Drug war strategy ==
#jews dispense welfare
#[[niggas]] spend welfare check on drugs
#welfare checks fund the dealers' [[gangsta]] lifestyle
#junky run out of money and drugs
#[[crimes]] committed to get more drugs
#welfare [[ruination|marginalized]]
#jews = happy
#[[????]]
#[[Profit|PROFIT!!!]]

== Arguments against the war on drugs ==
*A tax on legal drugs would bring [[money|revenue]] to troubled [[government]] agencies, now that [[W|Bush]] [[I accidentally|accidentally]] the economy.
*It costs [[over 9000|multiple metric fucktons]] of [[pwned|taxpayer]] money
*It has contributed to the largest [[slavery|prison population]] in world history
*[[fail|There has never been any evidence that it has done anything to meet its stated goals]]
*It has left us with a bunch of unemployable ex-convicts
*Making anything illegal makes it profitable, allowing even the smelliest [[Mexican]] [[douchebag]]s to produce trailers full of cash just by carrying stuff from one place to another and occasionally murdering competitors/bystanders
*The murder rate suddenly increased during [[alcohol]] [[fail|prohibition]], and dropped steeply after its [[troll's remorse|repeal]]. The crime rate during drug prohibition continues to increase, for [[common knowledge|COMPLETELY UNKNOWN reasons]], since [[sarcasm|the two are not even remotely similar]]
*Drugs {other than alcohol and tobacco} are cut and tanted by AIDS
*[[unfunny|Lulzkill]]. Junkies are funny when they have drugs.

== [[shit nobody cares about|Arguments for the war on drugs]] ==
*[[Amy Winehouse]]
*Serious [[lulz|entertainment]] and on-the-job training for [[the man|US special forces]].
*[[Timecube|Linear time is lie]].
*When ingesting cocaine, an otherwise placid Negro will, due to his Transformer ancestry, temporarily become a cocainzed super-negro and go on a sexual rampage door to door, raping one white woman after another. [http://www.druglibrary.org/SCHAFFER/History/negro_cocaine_fiends.htm Proof].

With the odd exception of hundreds of innocent people, the war on drugs has proved to be [[Whitey|America]]'s most [[lulzy|light-hearted]] war to date.
