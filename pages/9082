[[Image:William_J_Lashua.gif|thumb|250px|]]
Wednesday, September 1st, 2010; A regular anon posts a picture he took of a flier featuring a man looking for people to join his 90th birthday party. Fellow anons wept tears of true bawww. Determined to find who this man was, anons set out to make an old man happy, in what is now known as ''Operation: Strangelove''.

==Who is William "Birthday Boy" Lashua?==

[[File:Lashua 4.png|thumb|Now they are just sending cards to both Mr. Lashua and the Legion.]]

'''William J. Lashua''' was a man who (at a time before teh [[internets]]) joined the [[Army]] Oct 4 1943, serving for the duration of [[WWII]] plus six months, killing Nazis [[for great justice]]. He did this to keep the [[Nazis]] from [[raping]] your grandmothers and killing people that would otherwise pollute their gene pool. [[some say|Some say]] he is a real life [[King of the Hill|Cotton Hill]], though with intact shins. He is a great old man. He had his birthday party on [[Eduard Khil|September 4th]], 2010, at the American Legion Hall in Ashburnham, MA. 
 
===Operation: Strangelove===
Anonymous called the Ashburnham American Legion party (where the party was hosted), asking for the reservation and getting the name of the birthday boy. A quick search on the internet led to a man named William Lashua III, the old man's nephew. Old Army enlistment records were located.
From there, a veteran database, local VA, name and address were found.

===Operation: Birthday Boy===
A great burst of love for William developed and blossomed into an outpouring of cards, gentle sentiments, and emotional admittances.
Fans came together on Fakebook together and within a day the fan page for William's Birthday had over 1,300 likes. As night fell on the USA, various anons googlebombed "Happy Birthday William J. Lashua."

A plan to LOIC a Nazi website in his honor has not come to fruition yet. Keep your eyes out, and don't forget to provide verifiable updates when possible!

==It's Still A Party Even If [[You]] Aren't Invited==
[[File:Lashua 5.jpg|thumb|Screencap of original reddit post.  Of course some /b/tard is freaking out about it.]]
During the shitstorm of excitement, William's grandson took pause and [http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d8uyh/i_am_william_j_lashuas_grandson_please_read_this/ posted the following] to [[Reddit]]:

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
<p>Kind folks of reddit, My family and I appreciate the outpouring of love and generosity. There has been a large misunderstanding. The poster which I'm told was found at the Gardner Stop & Shop was more a local notice for people that know him. It was in no way to indicate that he is alone. He has 7 children, many grandchildren, and even great grandchildren. In his younger years he was a foster parent to dozens of foster children. He is well liked in the community, and will be fully supported on his 90th birthday. I ask that if you don't know him, to not attend the party, as it is for his friends and family. The venue for the party is a very small hall, and will be full to capacity with people he knows and loves.</p>

<p>By all means, send cards and well wishes, but please refrain from sending gifts/strippers/cakes/candies/etc. and instead please make a donation in his name to a local vetrans charity.</p>

<p>Thank you again for all the love and well wishes, we certainly never expected this. You are awesome reddit, now please help me spread the word to other outlets and make sure this is a smaller, enjoyable party for him.</p>

<p>'''Edit:''' There are so many replies, I can't begin to respond to them all. I love the fact that the internet has rallied behind this as a cause, and my family is overwhelmed with what we've seen and read. I've made this my soapbox to talk to "internets" and I feel it's a good place to do so. The outpouring of love, respect, and generosity has been amazing to say the least, but really... please... there are so many others less fortunate than my Grandfather that deserve this as well. This Labor Day weekend, go to your local VA hospital, sit, and visit with the men and women there. Stop off at a nursing home and visit there. Donate to a vetrans charity. Do some good for those who fought for you, and really do have no one to call family or friend. Still do all the nice things you wanted to do for my grandfather, please do. Use that positive energy and make someone super happy. They'll appreciate it more than you'll ever know.</p>

<p>'''edit again:''' For those of you still thinking of sending cards, please use the following address:</p>

<p>William J Lashua c/o American Legion<br/>
132 Williams Road<br/>
Ashburnham, MA 01430</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

|Yeah, I don't think I can even come close to stopping the internet love machine... as it sits we're gonna have a local cop to direct traffic and run some crowd control if need be.|[[faggot|Grandson]].

|What did you tell him? "Um, so..... the internet may be coming. We could use some help."|Some dude's reply.

|The jerky's already in the mail|Somebody at Bridgeford Beef Jerky is sending them some free product.

|The jerky will most certainly be appreciated, I know I keep saying in many threads that he doesn't have any teeth... but really, I'm sure he'll figure something out to eat the jerky. If nothing else, I'll at least snag you some pix of him with it. |William doesn't have any teeth!  :(

|I would love to hear the story of your family's reactions when you told them "The internet is going to Grandpa's party. And, uh, he's kind of a big deal.|Yes, William IS a big deal.

|    The outpouring from the internet will definitely be too much.  Please don't say this when talking about the strippers we sent you.|Wow, now I want to go.

|srsly i can laugh about puppies in a river, burning cats, hummilating etc. but i feel really bad for this man... he's probably lost all his friends and lives alone... this is really bad. like most anons. have fun calling me a moralfag.|William has more friends than you.

|WELL FUCK YOU ANONYMOUS IS LEGION! WE CANNOT BE CONTROLLED, WE CANNOT BE STOPPED. WE DO NOT FORGIVE AND WE DO NOT FORGET ABOUT OLD DUDE'S BIRTHDAY 
THIS SHALL BE A BIRTHDAY OF LEGENDS. POEMS SHALL BE WRITTEN OF IT. IT IS VERY LIKELY LASHUA WILL NOT SURVIVE AS HIS HEART SHALL BE UNABLE TO TAKE HE INTENSITY OF THE PARTY THAT WILL OCCUR. ASHBURNHAM WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. THE INTENSITY OF THE PARTY THAT WILL BE THROWN FOR LASHUA WILL REDUCE IT TO A SMOLDERING HUSK OF WHAT WAS ONCE A CITY.  LET THE PART BEGIN!!!!!!!|Uh...Okay...
