Something is on fire
'''Something is on fire''' is a common tactic employed by [[unfunny]] [[IRC]] users, saying "[[brb]] <insert object> is on fire!!!!" in an attempt to generate [[lulz]]. Rather than owning up and admitting their horrible sense of humor when called out on it, the user will continue to assert that something is, in fact, on fire.

Despite the serious lack of [[lulz]] in this [[old meme]], "Something is on fire" jokes keep showing up on [[Bash.org]], a site well known for its [[unfunny]] [[IRC]] quotes.

===Example===
:<penispump> brb [[City_glitter|cat is on fire]]
:<vaginarooter> you aren't funny.
:<penispump> no [[srsly]]!!!1
:<vaginarooter> if you have the time to tell us, [[pictures plz]].
:<randombystander> [[pwned]]
