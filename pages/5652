Nathan Satan
{{crap}}
[[Nathan Satan]] is one of the names used by The Devil.  It is the persona he uses when he craves the lulz.

==Accusations==
With accusations of spousal abuse and abuse of other [[woman|women]] in his life, Nathaniel Harris started out making websites devoted to various forms of [[sex]]ual deviancy and [[furry|perversion]].

==World of the Occult==
Eventually, drawn to the world of the [[occult]], Nathaniel became involved in chaos magic, [[Satanism]], and the writings of such authors as [http://www.harvestmoon.net/library/chumbley/chumbley.html Andrew Chumbley] and [http://www.hermetic.com/spare/ A.O.Spare]. Nathaniel would later go on to invent stories about being a member of a "witch family" named (almost in farce) "The House of the Old Ways", and lift large amounts of information from Andrew Chumbley's writings, and from [[ceremonial magic]] and Satanism, creating his own "book" called [[Witcha: A Book of Cunning]] - although this would have more honestly been subtitled "A Book of Conning".

==A. Reader Reviews Witcha==
Not content to be the published author of a very poorly written book on flakey satanism, [[ceremonial magic]], and new age [[paganism]] as well as being an amateur [[tattooist]] who is able to utilize such things as [http://web.archive.org/web/20020804151731/dr.nathansatan.chaosmagic.com/photo2.html Talasmagickal] ([[sic]]) emblems, Nathaniel began an online campaign to make more money off of his ill-conceived project. He went to Amazon.com and [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1869928776/qid%3D1115229938/026-1602929-4720438 impersonated A. Reader], making a glowing review of his own book, hoping to boost his sales. What he did not realize was that any Amazon user could see that his own profile was linked to every review that he wrote &mdash; and when word spilled out all over the internet, embarrassing Nathaniel, he attempted to remove the review. Luckily, a coalition of concerned people took incriminating screenshots, forever exposing the deceitful Nathaniel.

==Family Seekrits For Sale==
As book sales waned, Nathaniel, in pure charlatan form, started selling the secrets of his "authentic traditional witch family" witchcraft through a correspondence course for the cost of 650 [[American]] dollars. There is no telling how many people have been suckered by this fraud, but at least one very dull yet outspoken person named [[Tekla]] is a devoted disciple of this con artist.

==Guestbook Gleanings==
Nathaniel has quite a few enemies who came onto his [http://web.archive.org/web/20020819070622/dr.nathansatan.chaosmagic.com/fsguestbook.html original guestbook] (which he took down without thinking about the [http://www.archive.org archive that saved it]) and made accusations of domestic violence while also providing his address and phone number for diligent Internet sleuths.

==Mother May I==
In the archived guestbook, Nathaniel admits his own mother was the only one who came to defend him. Also take note of how he threatens to kill people who "try to use his guestbook against him" by "chopping them up with a machete". Surely, a great and powerful witch indeed, to be able to use a machete! Such wisdom must have been absorbed from his ancient House of the Old Ways.

==Aliases and Pseudonyms==

Nathaniel also goes by the names; 

*Dr. Nathan Satan, 
*Dr. Satan da LaCroix, 
*Lovernicus, 
*Skratte, 
*Sinister Elf, 
*Uberreiniger (At Live Journal, where he plays like a flakey fake "goth" christian)
*Mel, (Melliferas at Live Journal) Uberreiniger's flakey fake pagan girlfriend who is [[fat]]. She's even more fat than [[This is warmth]].
*The Dark Phaerie, 
*Tekla
*Tom Vinegar
*and the Fool on the [[Internets]] 

And he can be easily recognized by his use of double consonants in words that do not need them as noted in the review by A. Reader (formiddable) and others words that can be seen in his [http://web.archive.org/web/20020819070622/dr.nathansatan.chaosmagic.com/fsguestbook.html original guestbook].

==New Developments==

Savvy users of the [[internets]] were able to find evidence in the form of IP addresses in the headers of messages posted to a [[Yahoo!]] group, proving without a shadow of a doubt that Tom Vinegar, Tekla Wyrd, and Nathan Satan are one and the same person. Another recent glowing review of the book Witcha over at the US [[Amazon]] site by none other than Tekla Wyrd is actually another spoofed review by Harris himself! Oh [[teh]] indignity of it all!

'''*TOM VINEGAR:  80.3.128.4'''  
'''*LOVERNICUS:  80.3.128.4'''
