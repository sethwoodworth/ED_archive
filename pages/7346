Seed Plz
[[Image:Desperation.jpg|thumb|left|IRL seed plz]]This is a phrase used by [[luser]]s who are trying to [[leech]] some [[warez]] or [[pr0n]] from a [[torrent]] site. Usually, the torrent in question is   has been seeded [[at least 100]] days ago and [[everyone]] including [[your mom]] downloaded and left before the [[MPAA]]/[[RIAA]] homos got to know about it. At this point, however, some [[douchebag]]s decide to download the shit and get slammed in the face by '''0 Seeds''' message. Inevitably, these buttmunchers start moaning and bitching about why [[noone]] is seeding. These types of faggots also make exorbitant promises, like "will seed to 10:1". Unfortunately, these are the same motherfuckers who have just left another tracker with a ratio of '''0.004'''.
