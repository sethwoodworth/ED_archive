'''Mike Gravel''' is a flat-broke, [[batshit insane|crazy old coot]] and [[old meme]] from Alaska and a candidate for the 2008 Democratic nomination for President of the United States. Like his 'soul mate' <strike>Libertarian</strike> Republican candidate [[Ron Paul]], (also a proud member of the [[Lemon Party]]), Mike  Gravel is a [[loser|maverick outsider]] with virtually no chance whatsoever of generating anything moar than lulz and Internets. Neither of them has a chance of getting elected because Ron Paul is a batshit crazy <strike>Libertarian</strike> Republican and Mike Gravel is a batshit crazy [[anarchism|anarcho]] [[fag]]got in hiding.

That said, Mike Gravel gets the [[ED]] seal of approval for throwing some dick into an otherwise terminally [[politics|dull party]].
