Divierto
{{pixpls}}

'''Divierto''' is a very popular community on the site [http://www.greatestjournal.com greatestjournal]. It first started out as a community called "Divierta" but as soon as it took off, one of the mods sucked asshole and deleted the community. Since GJers could not live without their pointless-post-every-five-seconds-community, on came it's masculine replacement, divierto. Many rejoiced. [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Fags Others] created "TEAM DIVIERTA" icons and tried to combat the wave of those moving on. Soon it died and divierto blossomed.

Some GJ users use Divierto as a place to ask for advice (sometimes life altering)

== Layout == 
The standard black/gray/white generator style is a staple and damn if a mod (well, if they're around) tries to change it even slightly. While located on GJ the mods never put the Snakes On A Plane lyrics on the layout despite it saying "soon the snakes on a plane lyrics will be here" and never did. Suckers.

== Trolls ==
Trolls used to frequent divierto until the moderators decided to turn it into an asylum and seal off the place from the outside world so divierto-ians could fester inside like maggots with their icons cropped at the eyebrows. A few famous trolls would be:

* [http://www.greatestjournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=birthdaycat birthdaycat] 
* [http://www.greatestjournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=drunkcat drunkcat] who was always drunk.
* [http://www.greatestjournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=keyboardcat keyboardcat] who was kind of boring and made no sense
* [http://www.greatestjournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=sharkcat sharkcat] who always seemed to be being eaten by a shark but never digested
* [http://www.greatestjournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=kukluxkat kukluxkat] who offended many a peoples.
* and everyone's favorite, [http://www.greatestjournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=gatomexicano gatomexicano], who was a Mexican.

Still, sometimes other trolls manage to squeeze their way through the mods and then post pictures of their vagina with marker and toilet paper, with a shoutout to the community. 

== Memorable Posts ==
Once divierto moved to [http://asylums.insanejournal.com/divierto insanejournal], everything was still boring and [[shitty]] for a while. Then [[pot|potheads]] [http://sufjan.insanejournal.com sufjan] and her [[lesbians|friend]] [http://babyshambles.insanejournal.com babyshambles] started doing "fun stuff" like the divierto presidential election, the divierto awards show, and the divierto war on [[childlove]]. Other than that, people only remember shit that [[republican|Hannah]] says about abusing her future children. Then there was the weird phase of "jokerizations" of icons that occured thanks to [http://lucifer.insanejournal.com lucifer] brought over from (livejournal) ONTD because liking Batman is only cool when everyone else is loving Batman and dead Heath Ledger.

== Cat Macros ==
Cat macros have become a staple of a divierto-ian's diet as black persons progressively stole it from [[4chan]] to these [[16 year old girls that piss their pants everytime their bastardization "caturday" comes so they can post their [[moron|genius]] [[Photoshop]] antics.

== Leisure Time ==
During their leisure time, the divierto-ers don't go out, oh no. They flock to [[fuanon]] and go wild and snap off their bra-like username and go anonymous. Either they A. become bitchy, B. become bitchy, or C. write homosexual [[fanfiction]] of children's shows. They beg other anonymouses in the community to post a "post your most recent pic" entry so they can harass and insult the looks of many girls who have self esteem issues to begin with. Their goal through being anonymous is either to 

* make their head explode, a la [http://www.epix.de/images/scanners4.jpg 'Scanners']
* shit their pants
* delete their journal
* buy/sell/trade usernames

Some succeed and users delete their journal henceforth giving themselves lives, while other just argue to no avail as anonymouses gang up on them and declare a [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/H8 hate-on] for that particular user.
