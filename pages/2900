Fdisk
{{haxor}}
'''Fdisking''' your friends was once all the rage. Basically [[1337]] people of the time would use the DOS command fdisk.exe to ''clear off somebody's hard drive'' by erasing the partition, which got rid of all the [[warez]] appz, [[pr0n]], and other fun stuff off of somebody's computer. In essence, it was [[pwn]]ing someone's HDD. If you were caught Fdisking someone's computer, they would most likely call you an [[asshole]]. However, if you could get away with the act, you might succeed in making someone [[Emo|cry]], or even [[threatening suicide|threaten suicide]].

Some like to say fdisk is useful, and you should reformat at least once a year. But everybody knows people aren't smart enough to use fdisk as anything but a last-ditch resort to save a dying computer.

Fdisk does not entirely destroy data, it merely removes the partition, leaving you with a giant giant data chunk you can't access. Formatting is the [[final solution]], which also does not remove data, and only overwrites it with a layer your [[box]] can use and ignore the data underneath. This of course will be a poor defense against the [[FBI]] finding your giant cache of [[CP]] and taking you to prison while laughing at your lack of haxor skills. The child predator-approved method of hard drive [[pwning]] is [http://dban.sourceforge.net/ DBAN] overwrites your HDD with [[b|random shit]], making it so maybe a kilobyte of data could be [[recovered]] from forensics over a span of 6 years; making it not only useful for our [[pedo]] friends, but those who are afraid of [[1337]] hax stealing their [[Identity theft|identity]]. It also takes 7 years to actually work, so you're better off shoving your HDD up your [[ass]] if the [[partyvan]] is closing in on you...
