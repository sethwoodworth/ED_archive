Hai guy
[[Image:Haithread.PNG|thumb|300px|Original thread.]]

'''Hai guy''' was accidentally created by some fagget who thought [[B|/b/]] was [[Personal_army|his fursonal army]]. He wanted his OP picture to be shooped to say "HAI". Needless to say, anonymous shooped it with everything but HAI. Dumbass.

Unexpectedly, the topic started off strong with all signs pointing to epic win. It still maintained its uber glory, though newfags and [[MS Paint]] fags spending [[over 9000]] hours on Hai Guy dirtied it up a bit.

There were definitely a bunch of fail "LOL shoop this text with meme" attempts, but overall it was a pretty good start.
