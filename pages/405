Amber Baird

An 18 year old [[psychopath]] [[Cracky Chan| Crackyfag]] from Wilmington, [[North Carolina]] has recently been discovered flaunting images of a skinned [[cat]] online. The disturbing images feature the heavily pierced, butch male Amber Baird holding the burnt and defiled carcass of the small cat, while wearing medical gloves. The most sickening of the collection being a photograph of his gripping the head of the animal, whilst holding it close to his tongue, mocking the cats rigour mortis. The images were originally posted on her personal [[Facebook]] profile, where an uproar from her friends and followers soon ensued. Only hours later the images had been leaked online and were being protested against on various websites, including Tumblr and the infamous forum 4Chan, where an even bigger uproar occurred, because we all know how 4Chan feels about their [[cats]].


It is unclear as to why Amber [[IDIFTL|did such a cruel thing]], or why she was [[camwhore|evidently so proud of her actions]], but the images were [[Fucktard|soon removed]] from her profile as the news spread about her antics. Amber's 21 year old sister, the [[White trash|unfortunately named]] Krystal Lynn, argued that her [[dyke]] sister had found the cat already dead, and had just decided to boil and deface it's corpse, [[Liar|as you do]]. This theory, however, remains a theory until proven otherwise.

Sensing blood in the water, several [[faggots|valiant warriors]] from a highly respectable [[/b/|4Chan board]] decided to try tear dear Amber's life apart. After throughout entering her name in the Facebook search engine, then having a go on Google, the [[faggots|valiant warriors]] soon discovered Amber's [[Facebook]] page, her [[Youtube]] account (home to a lovely video of her sniffing paint or something), and her [[Yahoo]] idiom. These knights then proceeded to send her mean e-mails, create a nasty Facebook group, and dig out some worthless information, feeling satisfied with a [[Fail|job well done]]. It wasn't until [[Last Thursday]] that someone pointed out how these valiant warriors weren't doing anything that people began to try. The [[sarcasm|brilliant]] plan hatched was to innundate Amber with pizza (I kid you not). After 100 or so people had ordered [[over 9000]] pizzas, all from the same Pizza Hut, and all to the same ''wrong'' address (a 26 year old woman who just happened to share Ambers name), some bright spark realised the mistake. Claiming [[IDIFTL|it didn't matter]], better digging was done, and they finally got [[wut|something right]]. It is now known that you can reach Krystal Lynn (Amber's sister) on 910-777-4390 (go on, give her a call, she's a bit shy, so you'll have to be persistent) and that Amber's parents live in Wilmington too, at 1619 Gander Drive, NC 28411 (you should order them a pizza or something, everyone's doing it). Krystal, Amber's mouthpiece, claims neither of the sisters live at that address any more, but that doesn't matter. [[IDIFTL|Do it anyway]]. As for Amber herself, it is currant theory that she's living with her boyfriend, although do to the tragic loss of Droidfag, no address can be confirmed.

During the hunt for the [[fugly|lovely Amber Baird]], a [[hero]] was born. It is hinted that Droidfag went to school with Amber, that he uploaded her yearbook, and as he was in the aria, he said he would check out addresses. Now people didn't hold much to Droidfag's words, thinking [[Internet Tough Guy|he wouldn't deliver]]. [[epic win|But Droidfag did]]. He began uploading photo's of Amber's parents house, checking out an address she was alleged to live in (it turned out a [[Black People|lovely African-American family]] lived there) he closed in on the final target. However, just as he had arrived at Amber's alleged house (and announced "dubs" would decide what he would do) the thread [[404]]'ed. Our Glorious OP created another, and many [[bumps]] were posted, calling for Droidfag, but Droidfag had fallen. Most likely skinned by Amber Baird, Droidfag died a heroic footsoldier, a valiant defender of the cats. An [[hero|anon who delivered]].


Droidfag was a [[GOD]] AMONGST /B/, and we shall NEVER FORGET him!
