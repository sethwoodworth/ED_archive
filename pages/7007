'''Rina-Chan''' (AKA "'''[[Fat Princess|Runka-Chunk]]'''", '''[[Death Note|Kira]] [[Powerword|Buckland]]''' [[irl]]; formerly known as "[[Inuyasha|KagomeHigurashi]]") thinks she is a [[unwarranted self-importance|professional]] voice actress, when she is really a [[Scenewhore|whore]] and flagrant [[Wapanese|weeaboo]] (Fact- She used to be known as [[powerword|Gwen Buckland]], but she had her first name legally changed to 'Kira' because [[WTF|'Kira makes people think of a kitty cat']]). Born July 16, 1987, Rina-Chan grew up in [[Alaska]] with her mom, [[daddy|dad]], and her 20 Inch spike-textured vibrator, which she was given to her at the age of 19 due to her bad luck with the opposite sex. At some point, Rina-Chan stumbled over [[animu|anime]] voice actors and found that she sounded <i>exactly</i> like [[:Image:Bubblegumcrisistokyo.jpg|tight spandex]]. [[Reliable sources]] say that Rina-Chan is rather [[Hott|HAWT]] when viewed from [[Fat Girl Angle Shot|the right angle]], and if you have any pix ([[Adobe®_Photoshop®|shopped]] will do) to prove it, your [[sad|contribution to this article]] will be most appreciated. 

But even the [[tourneyfag|tourneyfags]] from the Super Smash Bros. scene don't want to bang her because her high pitched 3 year old voice can paralyze giant gorillas with one word alone. She even has IRL boys from ARASUKA (Rina-Chan also "speaks" Japanese, completing her weeaboo image) drooling after her all the time (the most notable is Full Metal Mario, or some shit like that). According to resources, he never shuts up about her, and wears a worn out Mario cap that smells like ass, but she still will not have the sex with them, because they are not pixels or openly gay men.

She [[blowjob|somehow]] managed to get enough "[[special|support]]" (by sitting in a gutter begging for change) to start a shitty [[weeaboo]] convention in [[Alaska]] called [[Shit nobody cares about|Senshi-Con]], and the attendance reached as high as [[You|twenty furries]]. Rina-Chan also started the "Voice Acting Club", a [[unwarranted self-importance|prestigious and extensive community]] dedicated to, for, and maintained by [[weeaboos|voice actors of all ages and genders]]. Oddly enough, the concept began with [http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/207423/1 a single thread] at Newgrounds dedicated to the [[shit|same purpose as the website]].

She is known to constantly drink caffeinated energy drinks and coffee. This enables her to actually speak like a person. It also enhances her "voice talent" by making her sound even more [[shit|professional]].

Rina-Chan's group of friends in the land of [[Sarah Palin]] and penguins consist of girls and guys who are [[wat|uglier than her, AND want to have sex with her]], or pretend to be her friend to for the lulz (these people are likely faggots and furries).

== "Voice Work? More like noise work" ==

[[image:VA_lifestyle.jpg|thumb|right| This is Rina-Chan's room...So, you still want to be a voice actor?]]

Embracing her [[blowjob|talent]], she found her way to [[Newgrounds]] and did voice work for projects of [[unfunny|varying notability]] as well as voice acting her (at-the-time) namesake in [[Shit nobody cares about|''Inuyasha'' fan flashes]]. She was a huge [[attention whore]] and basically forced people to listen to her voice. Thus making her involved in tons of [[shit|projects]]. This made her very popular with [[basement-dwellers|the boys]] and she was catapulted to [[Internet celebrity|stardom]]. And this, of course, gives her an [[Unwarranted self importance|ego]] the size of her [[vagina|birthplace]]. Because she is the only [[trap|girl]] on Newgrounds, and is coincidentally a voice actor, her annoying fucking voice can be heard in EVERY FLASH CARTOON EVER MADE.

Since 2004, she's become one of the more [[slut|prominent]] female voice-actors for flash animations and other projects. She winds up in a number of projects (despite the fact her voice sounds exactly the same [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h818PfkzaHE regardless] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYf_nqG_UtU of] [http://spacetree.com her] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQlXbgJ5ep4 role]) because clearly, she's [[THE BEST|the only female voice actor out there]].

Eventually, all the [[shit|fame]] started to catch up with Rina-Chan. Soon, she would move to [[California|California]] and get some [[pity sex|professional]] voice acting roles in [[shit nobody cares about|video games and anime]]. But, she has moved back to Alaska as stated here [http://allisbrawl.com/blogpost.aspx?id=16523]. Even with [[cock|all this]] on her plate, Rina-Chan still wasn't [[orgasm|satisfied]].

Rina-Chan said this after doing some voice work for some stupid ass-friend's work. Check the piece of shit here.

Voice acting club forum user and all around [[unwarranted self importance|conceited know-it-all Azn bitch]] Hnilmik unintentionally demonstrates [http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/330490 some of the same voice acting qualities of Rina-Chan in this audio parody on Newgrounds.]<br>


=="[[Super Smash Bros.|Brawl Taunts]]"==
In mid-2008, Rina-Chan approached one Kirbopher (famous for creating flash animations that look like they were drawn by a 6 year old. Fact- [[WTF|And offers people to actually PAY him for it]]) with a proposition: three minutes of [[Sex|her talents]] in exchange for three minutes' worth of animation.  Thus, "Brawl Taunts" was born and Rina-Chan reigned supreme on Newgrounds once more. Not one, not two, but THREE movies were made to make fun of a game that makes fun of itself, thus ensuring she would [[Lie|be remembered]] long after she was [[dead]].

The cartoons contained little to no actual jokes. The jokes that were in the cartoon (if you can even call them that) were lame, incredibly overused and unoriginal. Most of the material consisted of gay [[4chan]] [[memes]], [[gays|homosexuality]] (which is a requirement for all of Rina-Chan's "parodies" because [[sarcasm|Yaoi is soooo funny]]) and basically just showing what happens in the game with [[lie|witty]] observations. This is the recipe for [[shit|comedic gold]].

The Creators of "shit taunts" as their non-animated counterparts. Together they have made themselves infamous, by selling themselves out constantly by making terrible, unfunny parodies of things they don't even like themselves, and by voice acting rape scenes, which were based on their childhoods. Here, they bestow their douchebag IQ within this pointless interview.

== "The Backalleys" strike with "Brawl Funnies" ==
[[Image:Brawl-funnies-banner.png|thumb|right|Made with God's hands.]]
[[Image:102019 rina ch0n.jpg|thumb|right|This is the biggest favor she'll ever get from a person, [[fact|she's fuckin' ugly]] and will never ever be hot enough to [[Unrealistic Expectations|actually be fucked by Captain Falcon]] ]]
With Rina-Chan and Kirbopher been unchallenged and praised. On May 7th 2009, [http://www.thebackalleys.com/forum/ The Backalleys] which surprisingly consists of some Newgrounds members declared war against Rina-Chan, Kirbopher and the "Brawl Taunts" "franchise" with a three part flash collaboration project that would be called "Brawl Funnies". The reception to "Brawl Funnies" were both positive and negative, but mostly overall praised and accepted due to the fact that some actual Newgrounders finally had the balls to put Laurel and Hardy (Rina-Chan and Kirbopher) in their rightful place. Rina-Chan and Kirbopher's reaction to this comedic genius remains unknown.

<center><youtube>HoIaHI8F3sI</youtube></center>

Many of [[weeaboos|Rina-Chan's fans]] misunderstood the intent of Rtil's contribution, "Rina-Chan and the Brawl Boyz," (which was clearly the short that was drawn the best) and actually enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons. Which made for more [[lulz]]

Rtil and the Back Alleys are obsessed with Parodies, but are constantly pissed off because the parodies they make are so shit they cannot meet the standards of Kirbopher and Rina-Chan, which are terrible to begin with, so they show their hate every now and again by wasting their nights making boring flash cartoons making fun of other retards like themselves. At least some of them actually can draw.

== Her Reputation as a [[Tourneyfag]] ==
[[image:RinaPaunch.JPG|thumb|right|170px|The [[sarcasm|sexy]] monster returns to haunt us at [[Tourneyfag|EVO Game Tournament]]]]
[[Image:Juri not like.jpg|thumb|170px|right| Juri Han is not impressed by Runka-Chunk's trolling.]]
[[tourneyfag|Tourneyfags]] are torn whether to worship one of the only [[lie|precious]] females in their sausagefest community, or to bash the living shit out of her. Of course, they end up worshipping her for her [[unwarranted self-importance|talent]] in voice acting and [[lol|smash]].

As stated before, tourneyfags aren't desperate enough to screw her. Yes, these sad, pathetic virgins who still live with their parents still [[do not want]] to do Rina. Then again, she likes [[anal|being a virgin]].

== [[Incest|Rina And Dad Have A Moment]] ==
[http://www.youtube.com/user/DruoxTheShredder DruoxTheShredder] uploaded a video known as "Rina And Dad Have A Moment," in which he bitches about Rina's shitty voice talent (ironic, because his own voice acting skill consists of screaming into the microphone retardedly fucking loud, or sounding like a [[fag]], but that's just his real voice,).

It was removed shortly afterwards, followed by another video, where Druox revealed that he removed the video due to people from a forum known as [http://www.thebackalleys.com/forum/ The Backalleys] showing hatred toward the bitch and that he didn't make the video to [[Sensitive|hurt her feelings]] (also showing how big of a pussy he was).
