Semiotic
{{boring}}

'''[http://s1.zetaboards.com/Semiotic Semiotic Forums]''' are a lulworthy [[Australian]] based affair dictated by [[Terrorist|Islamic extremist]] Sayf Udeen. They were created in November 2007, but the admins staged a hack for lulz and drama. Today they have re-opened on Zetaboards software and more and more closed minded 1337 kiddies, [[liberals]], [[vegetarians]] and [[homosexuals]] are joining every day.

== Sayf Udeen ==
[[Image:Mr_Jihad.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The only book Sayf Udeen's 4 wives and [[at least 100]] children can read.]]
[[Retard|Semi-liberal and semi-conservative]] this [[Muslim]] like any good [[Muslim]] believes everything must be his way or things will get blown up. He is not used to lulz as they are not permitted in [[Islam]] and considered worse than pre-marital [[Sex]].
He is married to four women, Rola, A'shadieeyah, Zara and Amira and has [[over 9000]] children. His favorites are Abdul-Majeeb, Jasheed and [[Osama Bin Laden]].
He also hates [[Atheists]] and [[Why do you hate America?|Americunts]].
