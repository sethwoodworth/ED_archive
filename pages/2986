[[Flameviper]] is a [[13 year old boy]] who believes he is the greatest thing to hit the [[internets]] since [[TOW]]. He is also a [[Internet court|convicted]] Wikipedia [[sock puppet]]-master and has been [[b&]] forever for his [[faggotry]]. Flameviper suffers from an acute case of [[unwarranted self-importance]] and does not know what [[Computer Science III|CS-III]] is.

==Wiki-Faggotry==
Flameviper's dearest dream [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Flameviper12 is] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Son_of_a_Peach becoming] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Son_of_a_Peach_II a] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Flameviper_X-1 Wikipedia] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Flameviper Administrator].<br> Too bad Flameviper has been perma-[[b&]] from Wikipedia over [[At least 100|six]] times, as well as being booted from [[Uncyclopedia]], and numerous other wikis all over the interbutts for ban-evasion, sockpuppetry, abuse, faggotry, failure to deliver lulz, and [[Shameless self promotion|self-whoring]]. He has a [[Mental illness|disorder]] similar to [[Snapesnogger]] in that he cannot take any form of criticism. Telling him that he has done something wrong will invariably merit a flood of insults including his [[unfunny|hilarious]] one liner: "Your mum". Flameviper has managed to even get in trouble on a site like [[Illogicopedia]] and it is predicted that his next stop to go and "hope to become an administrator" will be [[Inciclopedia]]. Flameviper has [[copypasta]]-d the same info into all of his wiki userpages, this information in itself is [[shit nobody cares about]]. Instead of reading about what level he is on [[Runescape]] or what his rating on [[hotornot]] is, people would much rather see a '''snake getting punched in the face'''.

==Living with mom==
As with most [[basement dweller|basement dwellers]], Flameviper lives with his mother. Unlike most basement dwellers, he can only get on the internets at certain times. Naturally these are the times when he is ripe to be trolled.<br/> 
<pre>"an hour (or two hours) every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday, and Friday (weekdays). 
This time is usually pretty consistent, from 12:10 to 12:45.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm sometimes on between 10:45 and 
11:20, but don't count on it.
On Saturdays, I might be on for a short time, and on Sundays,
I will probably never be on.</pre>
[http://www.illogicopedia.org/index.php?title=User:Frameviper&diff=4661&oldid=4660 This diff] explains his unavailability at certain times.

When Flameviper is not on the internet, his mom is downloading [[scat]] porn and he is masturbating furiously in his room to [[Snapesnogger]] art.

==Identity Crisis==
Flameviper professes to be:
*[http://zelaron.com/forum/member.php?u=11604 A 21 year-old] from the planet Xanthyr 5,
*[http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Flamevyper A 22 year old Youtube user]
*[http://flameviper12.stumbleupon.com/about/ A "23 year old dracosurgeon" from Fargo, North Dakota],
*[http://www.myspace.com/flameviper A 26 year-old computer programmer from Arlington, Virginia],
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Flameviper&oldid=106887577 A Wikipedia editor],
*[http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/User_talk:Flameviper#Indefinite_block An Uncyclopedia editor],
*A sockpuppet of [[Jacknstock]],
*And a voracious insatiable faggot.

However, [[ED]]'s top sleuths have discovered that Flameviper (aka Flameviper12, Son of a Peach, Whosapeach, Flip_Merav_21, HUNGY MAN etc.) is in fact a [[13 year old boy]] called [[PowerWord: IRL Name|Adam Ridley]]. Though the last point is probably true too.

== Fur Faggotry ==
[[Image:Snake_getting_punched_in_the_face.jpg|thumb|left|ED's official policy towards Flameviper]]
Although he'll deny it, FlameViper was once an active poster on [http://www.furry-furry.com/bbs/search.php?search_author=flameviper furry-furry] <-- Click to see his postings. He recommended good places to find pictures of furries with "[[tubgirl|blurred genitals]]," making him a [[furfag]] who should [[yiff|yiff in hell]].

=== Some Quotes from FlameViper on Furry-Furry ===

{{quote|"fo me it was when i was 12 or 13 i cant remember which just wondering whether anyone found out about it earlyer or if I found out about it too young?"|--FlameViper|October 9, 2006 (Topic: When did you first discover furries and yiff?)}}

==Encyclopedia Dramatica==
Flameviper [[get on irc fgt|got on irc]] to try to get an ED account and hopefully become an admin while the wiki was down. ED e-detectives immediately searched multiple [[internets]] for information on the [[fucktard]].

Upon finding his [http://editthis.info/flameviper/ personal wiki], he spammed into the channel that [[you|we]] shouldn't vandalize it with [[goatse]]. Multiple instances of ''Huge3.jpg'' were uploaded instead.<br/>
FlameViper's problem with ED is genetic and it could have been cured by a 23rd-trimester [[abortion]]. He is prone to mood swings and nasty outbursts due to [[diabeetus]] and [[aspergers]].

===Why no good deed to him goes unpunished===
Someone actually was nice to him and encouraged him to write his thoughts about Wikipedia and ED. Flameviper is such an asshole, he falsely accused the person of copying that from somewhere (when it was too short to even copyable in the first place) and then Flameviper [http://editthis.info/flameviper/Special:Recentchanges?title=User_talk%3AFlameviper&diff=2130&oldid=2113 ignored the request].

===Butthurt===
For the first time in [[at least 100]] years, someone with an article about them on ED did not [[delete fucking everything]] in a butthurt rage. No, FlameViper is much more anal than that. He got an account on ED for the simple task of changing every '''V''' on this page to a '''v'''. This was his plan b, after his original plan to attack ED was laughed at by the people he was trying to recruit. No [[hugbox]] and no [[waaambulance]] were present - this was pure [[nerd]] rage at its finest. Flameviper has added nothing else notable to ED, further cementing proof that he is a [[failure]] at [[IRL|life]].

==Questionable Décor==
While E-Detectives were observing the Flameviper in its natural habitat - [irc://irc.chat.freenode.net/freenode-social freenode social] - they became aware that he had an unusual piece of décor in his toilet. Namely a picture of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night Vincent van Gogh's ''Starry Night''] above his toilet. 
As it turned out, Flameviper does not in fact have a poster above his toilet, but rather a mirror, as quoted in [[ED IRC]]:
<pre>[10:14] Flameviper: bathroom has a mirror above the toilet</pre>
This is presumably to quench his mother's aforementioned [[cast fetish|scat fetish]] through an elaborate arrangement of mirrors that allows her to touch herself without hauling her [[fat|mammoth]] ass off the bed.

==4chan==
On Flameviper's [http://editthis.info/flameviper/Things_that_are_awesome "Things that are awesome"] page he states that "4chan sucks, and then you leave, and then you read Encyclopedia Dramatica for 14 hours, and then you get everything."<br/>
Flameviper is incorrect in his analysis of 4chan. Firstly, [[lies|4chan is not that awesome]], and secondly; the mandatory hours that anyone should read ED for before entering the rest of the internets is [[at least 100]]. Flameviper has also bastardized [[longcat]] into [http://editthis.info/flameviper/Longviper this abomination].

==Forums==
<blockquote>Hey Sparky ''[Flameviper]''. It's mercenarie213, from RIO.

I want to tell you that if you have reason to suspect RIO of attacking your wiki, then you should remember that [[Sarcasm|you weren't exactly the greatest user ever]].

I'm not trying to be mean at all. I'm just pointing out the facts to you.

What you did: 
*[[Troll|Intentionally annoyed everyone on the site]] 
*<font color="red">'''Posted CP on the site'''</font>

What we did: 
*[[Vandalism|Attacked your wiki a few times]].


So, to be frank, we did much less to you then you did to us.

I will not, and have not taken part in an attack on this wiki, but I feel like you need to understand why some users are still upset at you.

Thank you for your time, and you can ban this account now if you feel the need to.

==Proof of his Jewishness==
<pre>
<NeoLobster> Failviper: here's a test. There's a dollar bill and jesus in a tent, and it's on fire.
<NeoLobster> Which do you save?
<Failviper> the dollar

==Youtube==
On his quest to fag up every community website on the internet, [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Flamevyper Flameviper has a page on YouTube] that proves that he is most certainly a [[13 year old boy]]. There is much evidence pointing towards this, but a simple video should suffice.
