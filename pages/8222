[[Image:Screenshotljdown.png|thumb|Oh fuck, where will I write angsty bullshit now?]]
[[ALLCAPS|<s>ON NOVEMBER 4TH OF 2006 THE LJ WAS DOWN. RIOTS BROKE OUT IN ALL AROUND AMERICA. ASSMUSTARD WAS ASKED TO VERIFY THIS DISASTER AND FOUND THAT THE LJ WAS JUST AS DOWN IN IDAHO AS EVERYWHERE ELSE, AND FEARED.</s>]] [[I_suck_cocks|HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]


THE MEME BEGINS NOW.

== CHAOS ==

(6:23 am EST)

MANY IN #ED WERE [[Faggot|SCARED]] AND [[Fap|BORED]] WITH WAITING FOR HELP TO ARRIVE. ONE SUCH VICTIM, [[User:logan|logan]] CONFESSED WITH STABBINGTON FOR HOURS, STAYING INDOORS AND OFF THE STREETS. [[Shit_Nobody_Cares_About|MANY PEOPLE WHO USE LJ DO NOT HAVE CARS, THUS FEEDING THEIR RAGE WITH JEALOUSY FOR THOSE WITH REAL LIVES. THIS IS THE REASON MAINLY CARS WERE DESTROYED. BUT ALSO CONVENIENCE STORES, AS THEY HAD, IN A FIT OF CONFUSED RAGE AND DEPRESSION, EATEN EVERYTHING IN THEIR APARTMENTS AND DORMS.]]
