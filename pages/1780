Copyright
{{clear}}
{{elaw}}
"'''Copyright'''" is a rallying call used by [[butthurt]] fags. After the [[raep]] the [[faggot|victim of copyright infringement]] will call foul and [[serious business|sue]] the [[Anonymous|bad people]] who stoled their work and made them [[libel|look bad]]. Usually used in the event that raiders have made parody artwork of [[lie|THEIR]] characters, but can be used as a convenient catch all when you're feeling butthurt.

It's especially [[lulz|lulzy]] when people who claim copyright infringement make a living drawing and writing Sonic/Final Fantasy/Harry Potter [[slashfic|fanart and fanfiction]]. 

When a butthurt fag cries "copyright infringement" remind them that they almost certainly wouldn't make an IRL court claim over their drawing of two crocodiles [[yiff|yiffing]].

According to U.S. Law, you can neatly sidestep copyright by claiming "[[fair use]]":
:Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.
