At its most basic, '''capitalism''', or '''jewocracy''' is an economic system which permits the exchange of [[money]]  for [[sex]] with relatively little interference from a centralized [[Big Brother|government]], and which, in turn, assures that the whore puts out. In practice capitalism uses the [[The Man]] to keep down the [[niggers|bruthaman]]. The ultimate goal of any person under this system is to make as much money as possible while making everyone else as poor as dirt or some kind of shitty sub-dirt. It was invented by [[Ayn Rand]] in the November 1959 edition of [[X_Files|The Objectivist]]. 

Capitalists believe that the [[Raptor Jesus|Invisible Hand of the Market]] will lead the rich to heaven where they will achieve a level of wealth they could previously not even imagine. Capitalism is often the basis for much [[drama]] in [[LiveJournal]] political [[communities]]. [[Jews]] (except [[Noam Chomsky]]) and [[conservative]] types argue that capitalism is the best way for the [[United States]], and thus the world. [[Liberal]] [[Communist]]s ([[azad_slide]] and [[pirat_ponton]], for example) think that it does nothing but [[fuck]] the poor. Capitalism was and is the driving force behind the colonization and murder of [[Niggers|non-Western peoples]], but [[some argue|it has been said]] they are now [[asking for it|better off for it]]. Capitalism has spawned such places as [[United States]] and [[Good Korea]].
    
In [[IRL|reality]], the correct form of economic policy involves [[ePoints]].

And, no, idiot. Capitalism doesn't have anything to do with typing in [[ALL CAPS]].

==Theory==
[[Image:Capitalism.PNG|thumb|left|Capitalism made visible]]
[[At least 100 years ago]] a man named Adam Smith was living in a shack in [[Scotland]] making a living trolling Presbyterians. He suddenly had the idea that if people owned private businesses instead of working for feudal lords, a force called the "[[Raptor Jesus|Invisible Hand]]" would guide people in the market to make decisions that would eventually lead to [[orgy|everybody's benefit]], [[faggotry]] and [[butthurt]]. He concluded that without a centralized government interfering in a [[devianTART|perfect market]] and with good conditions between buyers and sellers, people would be unable to exploit each other and would be motivated to provide good products and services in spite of [[gangbang|exploiting each other]]. He ran off into the city and found a [[Gay|life-partner]] named [[David Hasselhoff|David Ricardo]] who added to his theory later.

To have a "free market" there must be (1) "perfect competition" (no buyer or seller can unilaterally influence the [[microsoft|market]]); (2) "perfect knowledge" (all buyers and sellers have and provide the same [[data|information]]); and (3) "perfect mobility" (all buyers and sellers can [[troll|move]] to where they have the greatest competitive advantage). Since this does not exist in the US or any other country, no country truly has a capitalist society or ever will. Instead we have Corporations that want to buy and sell your life like a cheap piece of crap from [[Walmart]].

Although [[Some argue|people claim]] that there is no alternative to capitalism today, that's total bullshit since, as we've already pointed out, Capitalism is a fairytale, and, unlike the theory, [[IRL|in reality]] most capitalist countries are full of shitty service sector jobs and low wages. But that's okay.. because [[you|most people]] would just squander their money on [[hookers and blow]] anyway...

Capitalism was popular among [[4chan|intellectual circles]] but nobles and kings hated it. Eventually people got sick of feudalism and [[hack|overthrew]] it with the [[French]] Revolution and the war between generally educated middle class craftsmen against the vested interest of the ruling landlords and nobility. Then everyone was happy and [[anal sex|celebrated in the streets]] as businessmen hatched out of eagle eggs to swoop in and piss down wealth on the proletariat. Everybody lived in paradise (except for the [[poor]]) buying Microsoft computers and selling [[crap|Abercrombie]] until the dark rise of Capitalism's nemesis: [[Socialism]].

The two ideologies fought each other across parallel dimensions for [[at least 100]] years, eventually (after the epic battle of [[Mecha-Hitler]] and [[Stalin|Robo-Stalin]] at Mount Olympus,) earning the epithet, the Cold War. This was cause for a lot of drama and [[lulz]] throughout much of the 20th century and still to this day as, even with the end of the war, the two philosophies continue to fling [[shit]] at each other. Especially in online journals on teh [[Internets]].

Neither ideology is dead yet, (since neither ideology has actually been implemented yet,) but every now and then one will claim the other is dead and buried as a cheap way to claim victory. Some people think socialism died with the fall of "Communism" [[last Thursday]] (it didn't,) but these days capitalism is looking increasingly screwed as more poors protest against it every year. The heathens.  Indeed, there are an unfortunate number of pesky proletarians who still don't know what's good for them.  If only the Indian sweatshop worker could get off his/her lazy socialist ass and read a book by Jeffrey Sachs, he/she would know eventually capitalism will create a utopia, as has been prophesied.

==Modern Capitalism==

The advent of robotics has greatly aided the cause of of capitalism. Advanced collection droids called the IRS(Invasive Rape Service)now patrol capitalist cities and outlying areas. These robotic rapists peer inside a civilian's house during the late hours of the night, to detect a an income of less than $100,000 a year. If such is detected, the IRS agent breaks in and then ransacks the place. Once all of the victim's possessions have been stolen, eaten, and digested into money, the robot begins raping the home owner, killing their soul with every robotic thrust. This metallic phallus is actually a "soul vacuum", which is used to suck up the rapee's soul for sale to Satan. Once their task has been completed, the IRS agent returns to it's masters (the Government and Capitalists) and cums a bounty of wet, green capital in a disgusting bukkake of horror, delighting in the reality that no one cares about you in any system, except Communism, and that life is really just a descent into a fresh hell every day.
