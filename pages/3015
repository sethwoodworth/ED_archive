Food Not Bombs

'''Food Not Bombs''' is one of the premier [[attention whore|attention whoring]] organizations of the world. They are a loosely affiliated network of worthless [[anarchist]] and closet [[pyro]] [[bombshock]] user groups all dedicated to the [[stupid|fucking idiot]] [[hippy]] idea that some lousy digested [[food]] they found on the [[toilet]] is somehow cooler than the totally [[awesome]] high tech [[bomb|bombs]] that ensure the [[United States of Americunts]] [[military]] supremacy. They like to [[shameless self promotion|feed the homeless]]. FNB recently got fucked [[in the ass]] by the city government of [[disney|Orlan-duh]], [[florida|Flori-duh]]. FNB is currently on the process of changing their name to "[[Fellatio|Cock Not Bombs]]".

==Background==
At first glance, Food Not Bombs has the potential to be one of the world's [[idiftl|lulziest]] IRL [[troll|trolling]] groups. Unfortunately, for all of us, they apparently take themselves seriously. Like most [[socialist|excluded commie]] groups, their membership appears to be comprised mainly of [[rich and beautiful|rich]] college students suffering from [[unwarranted self importance]] who believe their [[leftard|left-leaning ass fucked]] ideas are [[serious|serious fucking business]].

==History==
The group began in the early 1980's, protesting a nuclear power plant built near [[Boston]]. In a move typical of the self-important, they turned to graffiti [[vandalism]] when they couldn't gain any attention based on the merit of their shit arguments alone. They spray-painted the slogan "Food Not Bombs" around the city [[Asperger's syndrome|because they fucking seriously thought that nuclear bombs are made at nuclear power plants]] (in a way, they are, indirectly, as [[TL;DR|plutonium - which is almost useless for anything but bombs - is one of the most likely products of the uranium enrichment reaction]]). As a means of increasing the amount of people that showed up to their protests, they began to hand out free meals to [[homeless]] people made with surplus food (garbage) from local grocery stores. Thus, a shitty [[meme]] was born.

==Orlando Food Not Bombs==

Last Thursday, a particularly [[gay]] form of Food Not Bombs appeared in Orlando, Florida. Despite its veneer as a world class tourist destination, Orlando has a growing problem with the homeless. Intent on making everyone know their position [[Why do you hate America?|against]] recent [[Manifest Destiny|American military action]], Food Not Bombs decided that the best way to <strike>exploit</strike> help the homeless was to parade them around Lake Eola, a public park right in the middle of downtown, close to where lots of rich people live and/or work. However, by doing this, they pissed off their own rich families and thus, got beaten and raped then kicked out of their houses (like their precious homeless people) by their fathers. FNB decided to pass out free meals, made from food found in a dumpster, at Lake Eola every Wednesday at 5pm. (because [[bum|bums]] only need to eat once a week, [[amirite]]?) By sheer [[coincidence]] (hint: because of their faggotry), crimes commited by [[poor|transients]] in that area increased.

===City Attempts to Ban FNB Faggotry===

Orlando [[moderator|leaders]] have had a long tradition of hatred for the homeless, and current mayor Buddy Dyer and city commissioner Patty Sheehan are no exception. Infuriated by Food Not Bomb's moronic antics, they attempted to [[ban]] them. The City created a poorly worded ordinance saying that no one may feed more than 25 people in any park downtown without obtaining a permit, and no one may obtain more than 2 permits per year. But the FNB kept exploiting [[Goatse|loopholes]], like holding feedings in the street, or sending several groups to the park at once, each one serving less than 24 people.

When the Orlando Commission made the ordinance, they also designated a "large group feedings" site on Sylvia Lane, in an [[poor|industrial]] part of town, about a ten minute walk from Lake Eola. The city would offer security and clean-up at this site. FNB rejected the site as "[[cry|unacceptable]]" due to the lack of running water, [[Larry Craig|public restrooms]], and pretty flowers. In lieu of restroom facilities, the city provided four "gross" port-a-johns at the site. Though port-a-johns are good enough for [[mexicans|construction workers]] and [[military|soldiers]] serving in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], they just won't cut it with the rich and beautiful gayctivists of Food Not Bombs and the homeless people they <strike>fuck in the ass</strike> <strike>help</strike> exploit. What FNB failed to mention was that their biggest problem with the Sylvia Lane site was the egregious shortage of [[camwhore|news-cameras]], [[old media|media]] people, and [[attention|ATTENTION]]. Because what's the point of feeding homeless people if [[noone]] is there to see you do it, amirite?

===OPD Fucks Up===

On April 4, 2007, the Orlando [[cops|Police]] made a huge mistake by arresting an FNB [[hippy]] named Eric Montanez for violating the "Large Group Feedings" ordinance. Then they threw him in the [[jail|pokey]] to [[rape|rot]], for a few hours, until the [[ACLU]] bonded him out. The officers making the arrest managed to restrain themselves from [[don't taze me bro|tazing]] Montanez, but the incident still provided Food Not Bombs with a smug, self-righteous sense of persecution, and more importantly, the attention they so craved.

===The Orlando Five, NEVAR FORGET!===
[[Image:Orlandofivefoodnotbombs.jpg|thumb|Look at the brave smiles on their faces. If I didn't know better, I would say that they ''wanted'' to be arrested.]]
On June 27, Food Not Bombs [[protest|protested]] outside a fundraiser for Mayor Buddy Dyer. Since their very presence wasn't obnoxious enough, they decided to bring a bunch of fucking drums to maximize their [[faggotry]]. When they refused to stop drumming, Orlando Police arrested 6 of the protesters for violating the city's "Don't be a Fucking [[Douche]]" ordinance. Their names: Jonathan Giralt, Ryan Hutchinson, Bryan Jones, Brett Mason, Eric Montanez(him again? what a coincidence!) and Will Vertlieb. Giralt was a minor, and had the charges against him dropped. "The Orlando Five" are awaiting trial.

FNB now refers to Orlando's Mayor as "Cruddy Dyer-rhea" because they love diarrhea. How [[retarded|clever]].

On July 19, The Orlando Weekly paper named Food Not Bombs as the "Best Protesters" of 2007. FNB [[shameless self promotion|bragged]] about the [[bullshit|honor]] on the front page of their website, which should tell you where their [[comment whore|priorities]] are.

===Orlando Pwned===
On October 8-10, Food Not Bombs held an event called "Ladle-Fest.". which would coincide with the trial of Eric Montanez. It was three days of pure attention-whoring and hot meals served three times a day so that the homeless could [[OM NOM NOM NOM|eat]] well, for three days anyway. On the 9th, FNB defeated the City of Orlando by getting Montanez acquitted of the charges against him. Orlando Food Not Bombs achieved [[EPIC]] [[FAIL]] by weekly feeding [[shit]] to the homeless and flooding the city with their pot-smoking gay-parade-marching crap. They got all the attention they wanted by convincing people that bums would be dropping dead left and right from starvation if they couldn't get their free once-a-week meal from FNB. They also likely received a lot of donation money that could have gone to one of the '''16 other service providers for the homeless''' in Orlando that serve three meals a day seven days a week, have no problems following city ordinances, and aren't in it for the attention.
Regardless of the service the homeless are fed from, they now can focus their welfare on the thing that got them poor in the first place, drugs and alcohol.
Thats donation and tax payer dollers hard at work, helping drug addicts afford food and drugs so they can die of overdose with your help.
