P.A. Palace
[[Image:Nigras.jpg|thumb|WHO BE BEEFIN WIT US?]]

'''P.A. Palace''' is, [[IRL]] a store serving the needs of the gogo community in [[Washington, DC]] and black person, [[Maryland]]. This would be [[boring]] and unremarkable except for the fact that their message boards contain [[epic]] amounts of [[lulz]] and [[drama]] due to their high amount of e-thugs and [[internet tough guys]] leaving [[all caps]] and [[altcaps]] rants like [[shit nobody cares about|WHO IZ DA DEEPEST HOOD IN DC????]]. It is incredibly likely that most of the posters are [[13-year-old boys]] who have nothing to do all day but talk trash on the internet and huff [[jenkem]]. 

== ROLL CALL == 
The Roll Call section of the community [[forum]] is frequently the  biggest source of [[lulz]]. The posts on the Roll Call forum usually follow a similar pattern:

1. Prima: My [[gang|crew]] is superior to all others.

2. Secunda: Prima's [[gang|crew]] is a bunch of [[pussy]] [[ass]] [[niggas]]. In fact, my crew is the one that is superior.

3. Tertia: The previous posters are incorrect, for I have the superior [[gang|crew]] etc. 

4. [[????]]

5. [[PROFIT]]!

Of course, [[Over 9000|all of these posts]] demonstrate that everyone on P.A. Palace knows that [[ALL CAPS|Caps Lock is Cruise Control for Cool]]. But the truly remarkable thing about P.A. Palace is that unlike most other [[site]]s on the [[internets]], the majority of the people who post on P.A. Palace are [[trolls]], albeit [[Trolling IRL|IRL Trolls]] who actually go out and commit crimes. [[Some argue|The other possibility]] is that the most of the posters are actually [[white]] [[13-year-old boys]] [[masturbation|fapping]] about their [[OL]] toughness. In fact, the [[irony]] is that many of the posters to P.A. Palace openly acknowledge the fact that many users are probably only [[internet tough guys]] who would be too scared to back it up [[IRL]].

The posts usually then delve into [[internet tough guy|threats of violence or death]] before some [[faggot]] steps in with pleas to remember their [[dead]] [[nigra]] [[boyfriend|best friend]] who [[shit nobody cares about|went down in a blaze of gunfire]] [[last Thursday]].

Very few posts are actually about gogo music.

== Trolling P.A. Palace ==
[[Troll|Trolling]] P.A. Palace is still unknown, since [[the man|whitey]] is frequently too scared to visit the website. However, [[Some argue|a number of theories]] exist:

''''The [[4chan]]'''' Calling out the users on being mere [[internet tough guys]] and calling them [[pussy]] [[faggots]] who have never even killed anyone, and that their [[gang]]s are composed of entirely of [[white]] kids who take it [[in the ass]] would effectively [[troll]] P.A. Palace. However, it is more likely that since most of the [[shit nobody cares about|discourse]] that occurs on P.A. Palace is [[niggers|forum users]] [[troll|trolling]] each other, any actual concerted trolling effort on the message board would just be like [[b|pissing in an ocean full of piss]]. 

''''The [[racist]]'''' [[Fifty Hitler post]]s and postings of the [[DAMN NIGGA]] image, as well as pictures of [[chikins]] and [[Verbose Thread]]s would likely produce a great deal of [[drama]] and [[lulz]].
