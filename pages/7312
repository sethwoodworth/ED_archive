*Topless [[camwhore]]s
*Evidence of [[fucktard]]edness/embarrassing admissions/[[epic]] [[win]] in [[IRC]]/[[forums]]/feedback pages on major news websites/[[your mom]]'s [[MySpace]]
*[[Habbo_raid|Habbo raids]]
*Amusing [[typo]]s
*[[Porn]] movies for [[cock]]-extraction to use in [[photomanip]]s
*[[Anime]] to create [[image macro]]s
*Posts to have proof after trolled users [[delete fucking everything]].
