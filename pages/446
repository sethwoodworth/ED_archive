This is an article about '''''Ancient Realms''''', a weekly cult-favorite [[webcomic]] by esteemed Titan50.

Titan began his career when he joined [[Drshnaps Productions|Drshnaps.com's]] [[forum]]s mid-2005. Originally a "[[noob]]", Titan learned from his mistakes and has since racked up over 1,000 posts and become of of DSP's most respected [[Admin]]s and is in the process of becoming a site author. When asked of his success, Titan simply replies "wot?"

Among his fellow forum members, he is acknowledged as the coolest guy ever. Ever. 

All things aside, DSP Forum members were devastated when Titan decided to leave in early 2006. Forum members attended a [[Chatroom]] "Goodbye-Party", Jer (Drshnaps.com's webmaster) made a heartwarming monologue that lasted an entire Chat page and Sephy made a post on the main page paying a homage to Titan50. The script of this speech can be seen at DSP's chat logs.

Although Titan still continues his now-award winning comic, he is no longer active at any running forums and little has been seen or heard of him in a few weeks. Email him at geraldwhear@aol.com. Comments on his page are also appreciated.
