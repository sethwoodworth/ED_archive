{{cs|niggazzz|History (Taken from their site and written by Webmasta)|
The MySpace Niggaz are a rejected few that dare to challenge our corrupt soCiety. Based with theiR lyrics And theIr desire to make a stand aGainst what is right, the MySpace Niggaz have been in existance for a year, and invisble for the last 2. Originally createD by a lone wArrior, named Nigga Fo Life (ZACH), the MySpace Niggaz consisted of Nigga Fo Life, Jerome (Nick), and Da Bronx Boy (Zach again). They went into groups and spoke their opinion about life, loVe, and polItics. At thE end of 2006, dawned two more Niggaz, Matt Q and Rodney. AS the MySpace NIggaz went on, the Hataz began to viciouSly fight the NiGgaz. Time after time, the niggaz myspace prOfiles were deleteD by racist biggots and corrupted MySpace officials. 

At the end of 2006, Bronx Boy had met Kazztaur, a very outspoken individual. From there Kazztaur began to align himself with the group, who by then had created a website. In the beginning of 2007, Nigga Fo Life was pinched by MySpace, banned completely. His legacy lives on.

Things had gotten even worst throughout their group as the famous Nigga, Rodney turned against his own people. Rodney had a feud with a famous hater known as Louie, and at the height of the fued, Rodney, along with his partner J-Money turned on the Niggaz.

Things were quiet on MySpace. Kazztaur was the only one to go out independently and show his leadership skills as the Head Nigga when the Niggaz, Matt Q, Kazz, and Bronx were under attack.

As the Head Nigga of the group, the group was left with no order. The MySpace Niggaz had a sit-down and discussed what would become of the MySpace Niggaz without their leader.

It was voted and decided that the MySpace Niggaz must have a strong leader in order to continue. Kazztaur was elected as the Head Nigga that would speak his mind through his words in the land of the internet. Da Bronx Boy would be the Under boss, and Matt Q the consigliere.

New Members were inducted in the group. After finding Kazztaur, Bronx had come to Matt Q and told him that he has a fantastic recruit. Matt Q approved the new nigga, and Lil Scrilla was inducted into the group. Matt Q also gave the ok to add Head Bussa from Oakland into the Niggaz. Lil Scrilla remains extremely faithful to da MySpace Niggaz. He obeys the rules and is almost as on MySpace as much as Kazz.

KC Kidd (Kazz) entered the picture, as one of the most self detrimental niggaz of all time. Known as the "Webmasta", KC Kidd was able to open up a good communication between the Niggaz. Its a proboards site and they go by "colors" so as not to be noticed if infiltrated. Kazz is "Mr Black". Scotty debts WAS Mr Silver.  The Niggaz get deleted once every week, so KC Kidd decided to form a group for the Niggaz themselves seperate from MySpace to protect them from the Haters. KC Kidd remains a made nigga, but stays behind the scenes away from the spot light because he spends most his time running the Kazztaur pro to keep the fuck up.|0}}

[[Image:MattQButtOuch.jpg|thumb|Matt Q prior to the [[butthurt]] incident.]]
[[Internet Tough Guy|Matt Q]], born to a single black mother and an unknown father in Harlem's HUD subsidized housing projects, Matt Q quickly became familiar with inner city street life. By age 7, Matt could disassemble and assemble a .45 blindfolded. By age 12 Matt, was the first child in the neighborhood to lose his virginity to the neighborhood "ho". Known for his caterwauling temper and urban womanizing of local "blak hos" Matt Q quickly became reputed as one of the most fiercest and deadliest street gangsters in all of the five boroughs. In Chinatown Matt is known as Liu-la-lu-wee, which literally translates into "Don't fuck with dat boy". In Little Italy, the Mafia hitmen always cross to the other side of the street if ever Matt Q is spotted in the vicinity. With a superior knowledge of firearms, narcotics, prostitutes and special affection for Rap and Hip Hop music, Matt Q rules Harlem with an iron fist that would make Joseph Stalin's spine tingle. 

===Da Bronx Boi===

With nowhere else to go Da Bronx Boy returned to his apartment behind Yankee stadium where he still resides today. A strong supporter of President Bush and the vast "neoconservative conspiracy", Pro-Life Da Bronx Boy is often involved in furious political disagreements with many misguided liberals. He is a proud supporter of AIPAC and the State of Israel, which often agitates the anti-semitic haters. Never quick to shy away from an argument, Da Bronx Boy remains one of the most politically motivated myspace niggaz.

Born Scott Earl Debbaro in 1985 to an unmarried high school couple from day one Scotty was bound for something big. At age 3, his father Carl died in a drug deal. Scotty is known for his loud mouth, and how quickly he is to type legibly and kill his character.

===KC Kidd===
KC Kid, aka Kazztaur is a fail troll.

===Jerome Da Godfatha Nigga===
Jerome was born on the mean streets of Watts, California to a crack smoking prostitute mother and 50 bloods. They all gang raped her so the father is unknown. Although they were never arrested for the crime, they are all now dead. Jeromes mother died while giving birth to him so he was sent to a foster home in the suburbs of California. Due to the traits of both parents, he was very violent from the start. As soon as he was able to walk he stabbed both of his parents and took all the money he could find. He wasn't arrested because he was too young to be sent to court so he just was sent back to the home to live with other parentless children. Since it was impossible for him to be kicked out Jerome saw the opportunity to whatever he wanted. He started a gang of bloods and they all took over the home and killed all the adults. They all ran off to various places and Jerome hasn't seen any since then. Jerome was too young to own a house so he was stuck living in various places and made a living selling drugs. He has all sorts of horror stories from his childhood, which won't be on here due to the length. When asked about writing a biography he said "fuk dat noyz bukz b fo krakaz n i aint lettin doze krakaz reedin ma lyf n shit." When he was 18, he finally bought a house with all his drug money... The day was September 11 when he saw the greatest attack against the white man ever (Jerome is aware of the white body count in WW2 but he said that it wasn't during his lifetime so he doesn't consider it the best attack against the white man). He then converted to the Muslim religion. This is the end of his biography because he does the same thing every day and he only wanted the significant things that happened during his life.

===Tyrone===
