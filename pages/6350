'''Perfection Dolls''' are a vomit inducing [[MySpace]] group that originated on [[Vampire Freaks]] in 2004.  They moved to [[MySpace]] because they are an assload of [[camwhore]]s. They claim to be exclusive and only allow 250 members to join. In spite of this restriction, membership is 47 now. Membership is constantly fluid and changes often due to [[nobody cares|inactivity]] or some self-conscious cutter getting their feelings hurt, thus causing them to flock away and trash Perfection Dolls for hurting their feelings. In order to get in the group you must have a rocker [[mullet]], wear a [[bucket]] full of make-up, [[Photoshop]] your zits out of all your pictures, and use some kind of distortion/blur effect to your picture to make it more difficult to see your face. Perfection Dolls is a [[clique]] where they all hype each other up and tell each other how perfect they are. Their poster band is [[Shit nobody cares about|Cinema Bizarre]] (a crap glam trash [[weeaboo]] band from Germany). They claim to be [[elite]] and [[unwarranted self-importance|envied]] and unlike any other of the [[scene]]/[[emo]] vanity cliques. In reality the are a bunch of self-conscious, [[zit]] faced, pricks that wish they knew who their real daddy was. 

==Members of PD==
As with most typical [[emo]] and [[scene]] groups where the pictures are shamelessly photshopped and they whore out their [[MySpace]] address to get as many friends as possible, the people all look alike and claim to be 'anti-social' and 'hate everyone'.  The girls are usually clones of each other and the boys pretend to be [[bisexual]] yet won't do more than kiss a guy because [[buttsecks]] is too messy.  Most members in the group range from 16 to 21, live in their mom's house and starve themselves while [[cutting]] their arms and thighs with kitchen knives and exacto knives. 

==The Douche Without a Face==

The leader of Perfection Dolls is a giant pink sock.  His name is Jase, age 25 and from the UK.  He always wears a cover over his face and a patch with an X over his eye.  His hair is photoshopped red in the two photos he has up of himself. According to his Doctor he has a genetic disease that runs in his family causing all of his teeth to blacken and rot out. He also suffers from the gout and has a bad case of the clap from fucking all the goats in town. He lives off of his mom who is the town whore. His dad took off shortly after his birth, he later committed suicide because he could not forgive himself for having such a pathetic and ugly son.

==Individuality and PD==
[[Poser|Posers]]. Non-unique. Every one of them look the same and appear to be humanized version of the popular [[Bratz]] dolls. They all have emo hair and heads way too big for their [[Loli|tiny little bodies]].  Emo children. [[Attention whore|Attention seekers]]. [[Camwhore|Camera whores]]. Perfection Dolls are a perfection beauty group that bases everything on your looks and not your intelligence.
