On September 11, 2001, Anthony Joseph Pereira was last seen rushing into the burning World Trade Center buildings, but was never seen again.

For two years, his final entry, posted September 10th, still got commments from people wishing him a peaceful rest in the afterlife. For two years, he was always linked to the tragic terrorist attacks.

However, after two years, the truth was discovered: Flashman was a fake. 

A few sharp-eyed LJ users noticed some inconsistencies in the flashman story, and they did some investigating. What they found was just plain fucked up.  Apparently, a girl by the name of Rhyein created Flashman for <del>unknown</del> attention whore purposes and posted on an anime message board. The [[Fox News|Internet sleuths]] found that both Flashman and Rhyein's IPs were the same.
