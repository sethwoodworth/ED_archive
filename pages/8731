VTEC Just Kicked In Yo
[[Image:vtecsimpson.gif|thumb|right|Milhouse is '''NOT''' a meme, and neither is this mediocre fucker.]]
== History ==
Hugely popular meme originating from the /p/ board on [[4Chan]] (Primarily used for the posting of photos), like all good memes, it started to die naturally. However thanks to the [[Virginia Tech Massacre|Vaginia Tech massacre]], several /b/tards noticed a similarity to the abbreviation of Vtech to that of Vtec, and well you can only guess what happened from there.

For dubious and unknown reasons, Anonymous is not a great fan of the VTEC system in Sony cars, perhaps due to the fact that such engine / speed wankery is solely the domain of 
idiot,<del>over-privileged children</del> poorfags and their love of [[ricers]] (Japanese Muscle Cars. See ''The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift'' for further elaboration. On second thought, '''don't'''). Something the aforementioned Anonymous and his bedroom / TCP-IP habitat cannot condone. After all, the average [[4chan|4Channer]] thinks of visiting [[Habbo]] as the equivalent of getting some sun and fresh air. Hence, if cars of any import are mentioned, the term '''"VTEC Just Kicked in, Yo!!111oneoneone"''' is posted, with accompanying image. RESULT.

== So what exactly IS VTEC? ==

VTEC is an abbreviation for '''Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control''', which in essence is a combination [[dildo|electronic]] / mechanical '''doohickey thingummyjig''' that gives your yummy Sony the equivalent of multiple cam[[penis|shaft]]s. As the engine moves into different RPM ranges (and if you actually even give a shit) , the engine's computer can [[masturbate|activate alternate lobes]] on the camshaft and change the cam's timing. In this way, the engine gets the best features of low-speed and high-speed camshafts in the same engine. Isn't that just FANTASTIC? I mean, fuck the wheel and penicillin, this is what civilization is all about. Srsly, no wonder [[4chan|4Channers]] ripped the '''fuck''' out of it. Way to go.

VTEC was succeeded by the imaginatively named '''iVTEC''' engine, where the '''i''' probably stands for the same shit it stands for in [[iPhone]], [[iPod]], [[iTunes]], and [[truth|iFuckedYourMomUpTheAss]].  But [[you]] already knew that.

[[Image:vtecinside.gif|thumb|right|I can think of worse things to have inside. A rectal thermometer up your [[ass]], particularly.]]

==  Do '''YOU''' Own A Vtec? ==

You! [[no u|No, you!]]! VTEC engines occur in many makes of car, and not just Sony and other [[Ricer]] runabouts either. Enthusiasts have been known to fit them into Fords, into Cadillacs, even into the odd mini or two, as they too wish to feel the full force of this meme, to know themselves exactly what it's like to realise '''VTEC JUST KICKED IN, YO!!''' 

Once you've experienced this, make sure all of 4chan knows too. C'mon, [[No | do you think they want to be left out?]] [[Truth | Remember, they're not laughing at you, they're laughing WITH you.]] (And remember, the [[cool_dude|cool guys]] with the [[so_cash|cooool cars]] get a free date with [[Cracky-Chan]]. '''ZOMGLOL!!!!!''')

Another VTEC video. The speedometer has had its miles per hour removed, showing only km/h. They reach about 150mp/h for you faggots who can't read metric.

==Trolling Guidance==
VTEC owners are easily trolled on the [[tubes]].  Simply enter any Honda owners' forum and candidly mention the following:<br />
<br />''My Volkswagen diesel produces more torque at tickover than your VTEC motor does at the redline''<br /><br />
and await the lulz.
