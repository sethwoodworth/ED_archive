TLA
'''TLA''' is [[Lie|commonly used]] as an [[abbreviation]] for '''Three Letter [[Acronym]]'''. This definition is historically flawed, since [[acronym]]s are supposed to be pronounced as a single word rather than spelled out.

You've got two options:

* Reject the formal meaning of the word "acronym". Heck, just look at the {{tname|acronyms}} box below and tell me that you don't spell almost all of them out. Why should petty rules about grammar stop you now?

* Embrace revisionist history. Call it a '''"Three Letter [[Abbreviation]]"'''. Join the [[Grammar Nazi]] party while you're at it, loser.

Note:  Use of common TLAs such as [[OMG]], [[WTF]], or [[LOL]] do not, in any way, make one [[1337]] or anything other than [[faggotry|teh ghey]].  Doing so will warrant relentless [[rape|raep-age]] of [[your mom]].
