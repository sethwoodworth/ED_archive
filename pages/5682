'''[[Neil]] [[Gay|Gaiman]]''' is a [[pretty cool guy]]. He came to fame for his work on the comic book series [[Sleep|Sandman]] (which guest starred [[Mars|Martian]] Manhunter) and [[Harry Potter|Books of Magic]] (which guest starred [[Constantine]]).

He also wrote novels, two of which were made into the movies [[Crybaby|Coraline]] (starring [[Dakota Fanning]]) and [[Star]]dust (starring [[Catwoman|Michelle Pfeiffer]]). His better novels, [[America]]n [[God]]s and its sequel [[How Do I Shot Web?|Anansi Boys]] of course received no media attention despite having a black person with [[Mordor|A HUGE GAPING VAGINA THE SIZE OF A HALLWAY]].

Finally, just like [[Moore]] got to do [[Superman]], Neil got to draw [[Joker]] mourning all over Batman.

He makes extra money by selling the name rights to his to the [[Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab]] to make special perfumes to raise money for...

==On Loli==

As a leading member of the '''Comic Book Legal Defense Fund''' ([[CP|CBLDF]]) he is fighting for free speech, and blogging about it as well:
*"''What makes [[lolicon]] something worth defending? The lolicon stuff is all about [[sex]]ualizing prepubescent girls, yes? Why do you, personally, think that it should be defended?''" -[[Nobody Cares|Jess]]
:"''We see Death putting a [[condom]] on a [[banana]] and talking about how not to get [[pregnant]], diseased, or dead. The Chief of [[Police]] in Jacksonville [[Florida]] thought it encouraged [[teen]] sex. The declining number of US rapes may be due to the wider availability of [[porn]]. You seem to want lolicon banned, and people prosecuted for owning it, and I don't.''" -'''Neil'''

==On [[Sexting]]==
''"I think that prosecuting as "child pornographers" a [[16]] and 17 year old who were legally able to have sex, because they took a sexual photograph of themselves and emailed it to themselves is utterly, insanely wrong''" -'''Neil'''

==NeverGay==
In 1996 as part of the [[BBC]]'s Learn To Spot Gays Week, Gaiman wrote a special drama set in London's Paparazzi Land starring several kids from Drama School with rich parents, and a bunch of BBC "Luvvy" actors, one of which was a genuine homosexual. License payers were invited to take part in the new concept of a "phone in" and identify the deviant. (It turned out to be Hywel Bennett [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwhere].)

==Neil Gaiman Is Not A Scientologist==
Nope.

Not even slightly.

Just like [[Will Smith]].
