EDiot
{{notice|Urban Dictionary definition: In layman terms, an EDiot is a [[Nazi]]-like sore on the ass of society. EDiots like to spew garbage rhetoric, [[why do you hate America?|Anti-Patriotic litanies]] and are apt to [[basement dweller|hide behind a keyboard and monitor]]. EDiots are also known to claim to have a [[User:Guise|military background]] when in fact they are for the most part some [[16-year-old]] punk who can't go outside for fear of a righteous ass beating.

<i>EDiot [[User:Theburk|Burk]] is a prime example of an EDiot. EDiots like to spout Nazi like statements and shows a general hatred of all Americans. EDiots also likes to claim [[LOL WUT|to have served in Vietnam]]. Unfortunately the only jungle EDiots have ever seen were the hairy tangles of genital hair belonging to their gay lovers.</i>}}

[[EDiot]] is a nickname for [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] users.  It's like [[Dramatician]]/[[Dramacrat]], only it's used more as a reference to ED trolling instead of [[EDiting]]. 

Invented on [[get on IRC faggot|#ed]] by [[OldDirtyBtard]] in 2006, it is the Encyclopedia Dramatician's counterpart to [[b/|/b/tard]].

EDiots generally sit in their chairs at home, furiously [[masturbate|masturbating]] to [[furry]] [[porn]] and [[hentai]] while watching Seinfeld, then every once in a while they unload onto their mother's bed and roll around in it, wondering what the hell they're doing with their withering cocks and miserable little lives. 
Each and every EDiot [[fact|thinks that he is absolutely fucking hilarious]], mistaking referencing their [[britfag|favourite]] [[animu]] [[furry]] show as [[unfunny|pure hilarity]]. ED editors tend to also use articles as [[an hero|an way]] to show off their "super fucking hilarious" macros and, occasionally, super not-[[retard]]ed-at-all [[dA|devianTart]]work dedicated to lampooning [[shit nobody cares about|innocent fucks]]. Most ED editors have [[no life|no lives]]. You might as well have VD.....iot.....
