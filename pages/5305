Mensa
<big>'''The following is an example of a shitty non-internet related article that has no business on ED. You can help by doing [[ED:LULZ|exactly the opposite]] when creating an article.'''</big>

'''Mensa''' is an [[elitist]] [[geek]] organisation that uses pitifully low-ceiling "[[intelligence]]" tests as evidence that they have something to feel good about. The organization exists purely for the ironic lulz of bilking people of their money to "confirm" their huge intellects. Flattery is pretty much the oldest and most blatant con on the planet, as well as the most effective: IQ testing administered by Mensa runs from $18 to $40 in the US, and you can take the test twice. Once you're a [[winnar]], you pay just $52 annually! A steal at twice the price!

Membership dues are PLZ 60 in Poland. At least they ask nicely there.

Like [[Asperger's Syndrome]], it's not uncommon for people to [[self-diagnosed|self-diagnose]] Mensa-level IQ-[[skillz]] by doing [[stupid]] [[online quiz]]zes.  Some people may even claim to be members, but real people that have made the mistake of joining will invariably tell you that they dropped out after they discovered what [[loser]]s Mensans are.  Most people just take the test for the [[lulz]].

Note that the proportion of the population that qualifies to join Mensa is exactly the same as the proportion that has [[BPD]], which may explain why they maintain a [http://www.us.mensa.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Psychologist_Directory&Template=/customsource/psysource_list_intro1.cfm directory of psychologists] on their US website.

If you are in Mensa, you have to wear a t-shirt that says "I'm with stupid -->" at all times.

===Facts [[Noone]] Cares About===
* Natsukigirl claims her [[I have a 140 IQ|IQ to be in over 150]] based on a test she supposedly got told the results of when she was 11.
* Mensa is very selective. Its average member I.Q. is 98.
* [[At least 100]]% of Mensa members are [[Engineers]] from [[MIT]]
* Mensa means "[[idiot]]" in [[Mexico|Latin]], "cafeteria" in [[German]], and "[[otherkin|complete failure at life]]" in [[English]].
*[[Billoon45]] has a proven IQ of 45, due to lack of air from fucking balloons.

===Mensa-Chan===

Some [[Chan|bitch]] decided [[100 years ago|today]] to post some [[tits]] and noods on [[4chan|4chon]]. She happened to note her affiliation with MENSA, something about her IQ, and also, tits. Due to her compliance with [[Anonymous|our]] demands, she was named a [[Chan]], and recorded here for [[lulz]].
