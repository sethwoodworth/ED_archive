Khimeros
[[Image:Khimeros_News_Post.jpg|thumb|right|The front page... [[lies|This wasn't badly edited in MS Paint at all, for sure, I swear.]] ]]


'''Khimeros''' is a crappy [[Wajas]] / [[pokemon]] / [[Neopets]] knock-off where middle-aged women and [[jailbait|prepubescents]] go to breed MOAR REALZ [[sparkledogs|sparkle animals]]. The site is run by a [[retarded]] [[furry|furfag]] named [http://virtuaIonyx.deviantart.com/ Onyx].

==About the site==

[[Image:Khimeros_Dog_Thing.png|thumb|right|Arabasti - Very original.]]
[[Image:Lin high.jpg|thumb|left|Look at that creeper face. This furry is high as a kite.]]

=== Breeding sparkledogs: a novel concept ===
The "point" of Khimeros is to breed [[fugly|colorful]] [[sparkledogs|pixel animals]] until your eyes begin to scream, puke blood and fall out of your face, provided you don't hit your "Lair"'s limit of 200 ways to slaughter someone's retinas. This limit can be upped by paying [[Truth|real money]] for more opportunities to make [[God]] cry. [[Loser|Obsessive hoarders]] willingly pay $50 or more for [[shitty|fancy]] recolors of the exact same art and think nothing of [[Money|paying]] for clones of their [[fursona]]s. 

<center>The junk they bring to Arabasti is just like the site - trash?</center>

<center>Trashy is as trashy does, fule. No litter bugs allowed!</center>

=== What Not to Do ===
You are '''[[DO IT FAGGOT|NOT ALLOWED]]''' to say you are bored in chat whatsoever or Onyx's staff will be on your ass with their assorted weapons of choice. Onyx however has expressed her boredom herself, violating her own TOS. Everyone within the chat is too scared by her supreme faggotry to say anything, or else they may lose their Mod status or lose out on potentially being useful enough to become a Mod.

You are also '''[[DO IT FAGGOT|NOT ALLOWED]]''' to conduct trades in the chat, but again Onyx, her pet Kimera, and her [[pussy whipped]] coder will do so why all others within the chat sit and watch without typing a word.

==Drama and BAWWW==
=== Theft, Fraud and Wank ([[retard|expert]] talking here) === 

[[Image:Beads.png‎|thumb|left| Only $1 each.]]
Like most breeding sim games, Khimeros has a [[Internet_money|currency]] that people purchase with real money to buy $50 pixels and items that can only be bought through the "cash shop", such as a [[Nerd|+1 shirt of]] [[Fail]]. For Khimeros, this currency is called "beads", and like all other sites with this concept Khimeros has had issues with beads and the concept of the "cash shop".

When beads first made their debut, they were sold as a "Strand"; ten beads per $5, or two beads per dollar. Not long after, Onyx decided that it would be [[Rickroll|perfectly okay]] to change the bead price from fifty cents each to a dollar each and cut every player's bead stash in half, regardless of how they got them YOUR FACE (either by purchase or from other users), and regardless of the fact that fucking with something someone has already purchased is [[illegal]]. The reason? Apparently the average [[fantard]] can't count.

When confronted about the issue, Onyx claimed that it would all [[divide by zero|equal out]], since she also cut the prices of customs in half, which supposedly means players [[Lies|"have as much as they did before"]]... And since she's the [[Jesus|admin]], she can [[cunt|do as she pleases]]. Onyx, not understanding the concept of [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Legal#The_Limp_Bizkit_Principle getting what one pays for], went on to claim that despite being listed as a "strand of ten", people payed $5 worth, and that is what they still had. Of course [[Your Mom|Onyx]] objected to being a [[Your Mom|thief]]. 

=== The Name Games ===
[[Image:Flax_face-1.png|right|[[unfunny|OMG CLEVAR]].
Like most SIM sites, the staff tends to consider itself [[incest|family]]. And like all families, the staff tends to have moments of [[Stupid|complete idiocy]]. In other words, they decided to act like [[retards|mentally fucked-up five-year-olds|they're awesome]].

[[fucktard|Onyx]], deciding that people were [[angst|complaining]]] too much about the item "Flax" being typo'd as "flax", in an [[not|epic]] moment of [[fail|intelligence and adminly responsibility]] renamed the item to '"[[unfunny|your FACE]]"'. The [[epic]]ness was so overwhelming that brains came out of everyone's nose and they ate more babies to celebrate.

Not long after, after telling new site members that it [[bullshit|wasn't possible to change their usernames and log-in information]], Onyx and her friends had a [[orgy|lively romp]] in the chatroom, in which Onyx changed the usernames of staff of older members.YOUR MOMMAS FACE When newer members and those not deemed as worthy became confused and wondered why they couldn't get their own names changed, Onyx decided to [[rape|bless people]] with an item that could change their usernames...for a [[Jew gold|price]], of course.

[[Bitch|Onyx]] is a complete pandaphile zombie from Vancouver who enjoys turning everyone into hippie treehuggers. The idea of this [[Lies|OMG ORIGINAL]] site was spawned when its [[Bestiality|zoophilic fantasies]] were going completely unfulfilled by [[Wajas]]. As a result, it decided it was going to throw together a website that was ZOMG MOAR SPESHULER and had actual [[Mary_Sue|human avatars]], to leave the option of dogtucking with human characters wide open as a possible [[Role-playing|roleplay]] option within the canon of the Khimeros storyline.

Onyx has art made as she gets new in real life pets, this is how she gets her ideas. She claims to be running an original site but in reality she is using it to project her [[furry|zoophiliac]] [[rape|love]] that is not all that original when it comes to pet sites.

She thinks she is '''SO ORIGINAL''' that if any other site produces a similar item she see's it as copying her ideas. If someone made an [[Tygras|ocelot character]] that of which was not faggotly rainbow patterned you would be copying too.  

She promises all of these new things to come but is currently working on her new site known as Aluriya - see below. 

One of the other things Onyx excels in is using people. It has been many times seen with every new staff member that she acts like a best buddy when someone is useful to her, and as soon as they live past their usefulness, she will treat them as scum who are not worthy to take up her OMG SO PRECIOUS time. She loves them, uses and abuses them, them dumps them with nothing but the title and very irregular BEAD PAY.

Onyx has said herself in the chat that she supports the Japanese whaling vessels and that on her annual vacations she like to go up north and club baby seals to death. 

'''More on staff pay''': Staff are only given 20 beads once a month (On extremely regular dates I might add!) for their hard work while Onyx is busy rubbing one out on her coder's face while yelling "YOUR FACE". These 20 beads can buy staff one generation (1) pet or they can blow it on very few cash shop items that have different rarities distributed. It takes the average person $40+ USD to acquire every item, while the owner simply puts the items she wants in her inventory for free. On top of the shitty pay staff also get treated shitty. Why anyone would want to be staff is beyond even [[God]].

Onyx really enjoys expressing how [[butthurt]] she is in the chat when she see's people ranting about her fantasy [[your mom|bestiality]] website. She epically fails in acting like it doesn't bother her, [[lolwut|but in reality she is crying while sucking her thumb for comfort, as she pretends to be her rainbow ocelot fursona seen there to the right]].

If you bring up how much of a ripoff her website is she will shove server costs in your face and then sick her staff, or users whom suck-up on your ass, and from there you will become a total outcast because it's considered BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWING.

Her favorite chat face is >___________________> which is an obvious sign of irritation or dislike for you. Be careful when you see this face, it can mean; a ban is coming or she is planning to [[furry|fingerbang]] your dog.

Onyx released what she calls "Roleplay Communities". This was a scam which she had hoped would draw everyone from [[Wajas]] onto Khimeros. This was an epic fail further proving that Onyx is a raunchy snatch. When it didn't go the way she wanted she decided to [[emo|whine]] about it in chat like everything else!

Onyx has [[obese|some sort of back disorder]] and a love for the game coder Pyro who publicly denied her when she attempted to e-rape his nuts. She was denied due to her becoming a [[you|fat]] fucking [[women|kwhore]] in front of the computer, because she can not do even the simplest of IRL tasks. She has stressed that her back disorder is from getting nailed by a horse from a petting zoo nearby her duplex, even though talking about anything of an explicitly sexual nature is against the [[Hitler|overlord's]] rules.

==Other admins==

*'''Nasire''' - Laziest, one of the [[emo|whiniest]] coders in history... has been known to admittedly pull big sections of her own furry glorification site's coding and shove them into Khimeros when she can't be bothered to code things PROPERLY... you know... like she's PAID to do... (A fact Onyx LOVES to bawww about when her precious coder goes missing.) Onyx does especially [[fuck|favor]] her coder despite her absent mindedness and total retardation. This coder apparently is a software engineer but her skills say otherwise. Something extremely simplistic can take this coder three weeks to a month to complete despite Khimeros being her full time job.

*'''Crash''' - [[kill it with fire|The pregnant, moody one who is complaining every day about the new little furfag she's going to pop into the world in a few months]], but on the bright side she seems to have used it as an excuse to stop paying Khimeros any attention... maybe she's just smart enough to see a sinking ship when there is one!

*'''Kimera''' - Previously known as Onyx's attack [[fursona|dog]], she's a snarky bitch who loves to tear into people when they aren't looking, or openly when her [[BDSM|mistress Onyx commands it so]]. She owns rats and is more commonly known as "Rat Woman" due to her sensational love for them. She mass breeds them to sell to those who desire to have them inserted into their anus, she too participating. She is said to be making a great deal of money from this venture... apparently making more than Onyx is currently making from Khimeros! 

==The Moderators==
[[Image:Rabbitskull.png|thumb|left|Save these to save your life. Offerings appease the Mods. ]]
[[wat|The Moderators are too elite for anyone else with their purple faces]]. The other members weep wishing they could be so [[fail|awesome]] but they know they never can. 

=== Things to Know ===
*'''Pony''' A [[gay|Heterosexual]] guy named Pony? Clearly this person enjoys having a good butt romping done to him... preferably by something of the equine persuasion. Also sense hes a mod you can't argue with him! He starts arguments and will test you to see if you argue back! WHY? do you ask?! Because He has no real life and he being fat makes him angry! Though originally he'd take out his anger on Lop (his girlfriends or whatever)and beat the shit out of her, but to our surprise hes too big of a pussy to fight her in fear of getting hurt from his battles! He wont show his real self because of all the the [[domestic abuse|bruises on his face]]! 
*'''LotS(A.K.A Lady of the Sea)''' pulls out her [[loldong|Chatwhip]] if you enter without bowing. She plays the role of most important Mod, and most strict. With this skill she is able to inflict some real serious business that makes her a real power hungry twat machine. She claims to take her khimeros staff duties as SOOPER SRS BZNZZ! And yet in chat she can more commonly be seen bitching about her many health problems than Khimeros related situations. With almost no prompting she will begin said complaining until everyone is so sick of it they either leave chat or [[Emo|commit suicide.]] She takes high offense to anything written about her and gets upset at the slightest insult. When you talk to her about anything that has nothing to to with Khimeros she likes to shove her opinions down your throat by saying you can't argue with her because she is a "mod".
*'''TrinkaPuppy''' will just sic her pythons on you, and since these pythons are often used similarly to Kimera's rats. She is a fat whale with nothing going for her. Trinka tends to conform to those around her and twist her stories. She gets annoyed when others exaggerate their storytelling and whatever the fuck, but hypocritically does the same thing.
*'''LizBlackDog''' is the HARDCORE Mod for when battling comes out, she plays the part well by cussing like a sailor and acting like a hideously fat rhino on steroids.
*'''Away''' is the innocent one, the mod that is Onyx's current favorite and pet because she is presently sort of useful in helping her create her next furfag fantasy site, Aluriya. She has since moved onto Aluriya as head mod. Promotion or demotion? You decide.
*'''Bella''' is the spoiled brat of the team, who demands to have one of everything and is well known for BAWWWWW tantrums in chat... also LOVES to spread her furry love around. Rumor has it that when she first joined she was under 13, and may still be now, not that her precious "Onyx" would believe it.
*'''Coyote''' is so thick that you can insult her to her face and laugh as she fails to understand you... how this person ever became a mod is a wonder to all on the site. Thankfully isn't a mod anymore.
*'''Angelic Ophelia''' is the staff that is hardly noticed and tries too hard, she thinks she is a [[twilight|sparkling vampire]].
*'''Twi''' is a middle aged woman who refuses to show pictures of herself, everyone knows for quite obvious reasons it is because she is a [[your mom|fatass]] hermit. She does some site art that is not even that good, and for the most part parks her ugly donkey ass in the chat room blurting comments that no one responds to. You would think she would catch on.
*'''Wild Rose''' is the single most useless moderator on the whole site.  It's unclear what, if anything, she actually does.  Apparently she is some kind of personal friend of Onyx IRL, ever since they ran a dog prostitution ring in Onyx's basement and fucked golden retriever puppies together.  Wild Rose shamelessly uses Khimeros to sell copies of her crappy fake published [[Vanity_press|Lulu]] book that if you were not a total dumbass, you could read for free on her lame website, though why you would EVER want to read the shitty fantasy puke-inducing crap is beyond anyone.  Anyone with a brain anyway, which clearly anyone who would be on Khimeros DOES NOT possess.  So whatever.

==Khimeros Fanbrats==
[[Image:Fanbrats.png‎ |thumb|left|The biggest Fan-brat of them all.]]
The [[elitist|typical Khimeros user]] is an [[elitist|awesome]], [[otaku|animu-obsessed]], illiterate inbred who probably has inclinations towards durtaggotry and are easily corruptible. Many of them are utterly spineless brass kissers and cocktuckers who will say anything to get into Onyx's good graces. By no small coincidence, the bulk of them are users who seem to be under 12, which works out as purely ideal for [[your mom|Onyx]] and her "[[Your Mom|personal tastes]]".

Those who can't get in or get frozen like to whine on [[Aywas|other sites]] and claim they are too good to buy virtual currency. Every single member has [[dyslexia]] and gets offended by everything. They are all [[your mom|uber]] touchy to the max.  If you offend them, they will loudly let you know and you'll never hear the end of their OFFENSE. 



==Other Fagbrat Followers==
*'''Miss Mossy''' is a pre-teen wannabe "emo" who only showers once a month and never brushes her hair.  Her stinky ass can be found in chat complaining about every thing she happens to lay eyes on, she never seems to be happy.  
*'''Chase''' is an adolescent Asian who claims to be a [[troll]] and love [[trolling]]. Trolling is against Khimeros TOS but everyone knows that this person is a lying Arab seeking recognition by the more dominant color, so everyone ignores the fact that Chase is borderline [[Chris-Chan|mentally retarded]] [[Asian]] and accepts them for their trolling failure.
*'''Soleil''' Also wants to be a mod so she can spend even more time sucking Onyx's cock, unfortunately she is not furry, talented or literate enough to give Onyx the all important hard on for her, and therefore she cannot rise to the level of the staff.
*'''Silvered Fox''' sits on the computer all day long while she struggles to make an income by making [[furfag]] attire.
*'''FairyEyez''' sits and waits in the chatroom hoping to be recognized someday, to be blessed with a purple Mod name.
*'''Khuriya''' is like the secondary attack dog to Onyx. When Kimera is busy putting rats in her ass, Khuriya takes their place.
*'''Lop''' is Pony's [[obese]] girlfriend but everyone knows she is the same person, and there is no denying that Lop is really Pony's [[whore|sex horse]].
*'''Coral Rain''' used to hang out on Khimeros a lot until she was made fun of too hardcore that she never came back. She dreamed of becoming a Mod and helping people with their CSS needs, when she herself couldn't even construct slightly clean code.
*'''Hitsuji''' is also known for baawing. They sold what they described as their most prized pets on Khimeros. They went on hiatus once doing this only to return and pour their heart about their idiocy in the chat room. Onyx was immediately at their side claiming that she would help Hitsuji get his pets back. Would Onyx have done this for her site users, the site she claims to love and care about so much? No! Friends only, gtfo. Shortly after their loss they began nagging about becoming a Mod. They were never Modded but are now a "Roleplay Moderator", which is a basic user with privileges that are hardly worth having.
*'''Shadowedblood''' is yet another [[fatass]] that spends her time chatting it up. She claims to be going to school for her software engineer degree or some shit like that. Funny thing is this was never mentioned until she knew that the Khimeros coder had a degree in this field(Which is highly doubted that Nasire, the site coder, does in fact have a real degree). Shadowedblood will go on about coding whenever it is mentioned, but she is really an incompetent underaged dumbass.
*'''KetSabi (Ket)''' is an anorexic alcoholic freak and secretly has four kids! She claims to be 100LBS but we all know she edits all of her pictures to make her look like a twig! She's actually 300LBS! She's able to speak about her illegal love life freely and nobody saying something about it! But once she says she took a drink of a Margarita she gets yelled at by her [[your mom|enemy]] Pony! They will go as far as ignoring each others existence on Chat to trying to get each other kicked off. Fun times.  She is also so pathetic that she had to add herself to this page because no one else pays enough attention to her to add her.  How pathetic is it that she had to put herself in?  She is also too stupid to realize that no one believes her lies in the chat and mostly everyone ignores her. Tis sad.

==Aluriya.com==

Onyx hopes to steal more money and bankrupt her fellow furtags. The site was designed by CHASE and AWAY of Khimeros, who's knowledge of Web Design does not surpass the usage of scroll box's. These two are useful to Onyx because they will bow to her mighty faggotry and get free admission into Aluyria simply by providing their animals for Onyx to bang. Onyx's knowledge of anything but animal sex and yiff leads her to be amazed by even the shittiest things she is shown. That and she does not have to pay them any real $$$, as she would rather spend that on her next months [[your mom|animalsex.com]] subscription. 

Chase and Away are guttertwat's in training. It is foretold that in order for them to one day reign supreme they must get whore hutt tucked in by Onyx's trusty strap in dock, that of which was custom made to resemble her rainbow ocelots dock. Rumor has it that they have accepted these stipulations.

[[Last Thursday]] Aluriya.com went live and in alpha and costs $15 dirty dollars to get an account with shitty customs costing $20 and [[wajas|custom customs]] costing anywhere upwards of $100 from a shit overpriced artist.

We all know that Onyx is very good at coping other sites. If you were tired of [[aywas|Aywas]] and Digis you can play Aluriya now. It's the same exact thing only with Hibbary artwork slapped on top. Even better, Onyx is such an [[lie|awesome]] administrator that she left ALL of her image folders open for you to download all her content! Ever wonder how their images work? Well, now you can download all the files and piece them together on your own site. 

*[http://www.aluriya.com/static/]

Content includes, but not limited to, NPCs, human characters, concept sketches and upcoming species. Why spend the money to see what the site is about when you can just go through all their folders?
