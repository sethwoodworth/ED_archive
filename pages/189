Aaron Sorkin
[[Image:Sorkin.jpg|frame|Crack makes you hornrimmed!]]

Aaron Sorkin is a whiny old crackhead who can't stand the [[lulz]], case in point, his new show, "Studio 60", which is only good to watch if you're completely pretentious and full of [[crap]], or if you're looking for an alternative to [[heroin]].  Don't say this to any [[yuppies]] or they will run you over with their Range Rovers while yelling "OMG STUDIO 60 IS SAVING TELEVISION FROM REALITY PROGRAMMING!!!!!1111", when really, wouldn't we all rather watch [[attention whores]] sucking [[cock]] for [[crack|money]]?

Sorkin has his [[goatse|head so far up his own ass]] that in the first episode of S60 he informed his audience that "their remote is a crackpipe".  Sorkin likes to pretend he doesn't know what a crackpipe looks like. 

== THE FOLLOWING SECTION IS FUNNIER THAN STUDIO 60 ==

Sorkin got lulzed over at [[Television Without Pity]] (back when it was known as Mighty Big TV), where he read the forums about "The West Wing", got all [[emo]] about it, and then wrote [[butthurt | AN ENTIRE EPISODE]] of a show supposedly about the inner-workings of the White House where all he did was [[bitch]] about how the moderators on forums are [[fat]], chain-smoking [[nerds]].  Despite the fact that this is [[lies | true]], it was still totally [[lame]], but it made a lot more sense once everyone figured out Sorkin is a crackhead [[fact | for reals]].

Sorkin is also [[obsessed]] with his ex-girlfriend Kristen Chenoweth, who isn't half bad, but that's why the character of Harriet on S60 makes one want to cut out their own ears from the inside first.  He wrote [[butthurt | AN ENTIRE EPISODE]] of S60 about how girls shouldn't appear in [[porn|lad mags]] just because he was mad everyone saw his lady's [[boobs]].

[[JEWS DID WTC | Sorkin also did 9/11]].  And then wrote [[butthurt|AN ENTIRE EPISODE]] about it.
