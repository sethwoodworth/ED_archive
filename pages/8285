'''''The Powerpuff Girls''''' is the [[animu]] equivalent of a fifth-generation inbred retarded web-toed [[whore]] from [[Florida]]. Born of an [[incest|incestuous]] fuckfest between [[Japanese]] animation and [[Wapanese|fanboys]] who actually managed to stop [[masturbate|jerking off]] long enough to get a real job, and also by [[Cocaine|sugar]], [[Shit|spice]], and [[Goatse|everything nice]], it is an [[unfunny]] cartoon birthed [[last Thursday]] starring three handless [[asking for it|prostitots]] who save the world from [[W|an evil monkey]]. Full of [[loli]], it has a cult-following among [[13-year-old boys]] and a poorly-written Internet fan comic by [[Bleedman]] and [[Mikemedia]].

== Plotlines ==
[[Image:Ppg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Haters gonna hate]]]]

While the show has been deemed too god awful to even score a 3 a.m. time slot in [[Iraq]]iana, for a brief period in Generation Y's long and embarrassing history it was actually advertised on some pedo cartoon network between Looney Tunes bashing [[niggers]] and [[Germany|Krauts]] marathons. Featuring a bunch of new age Cabbage Patch dolls incapable of giving a good hand job the basic idea revolved around sucking off evil robots, space monsters, and sometimes both at the behest of the US government's war on Jesus hatin'.

Eventually something usually happened that nobody ever witnessed because they were too busy switching the god damn channel the second the title music started. Everybody that could claim knowledge about how any episode of this show ends is probably lying because they were too busy pounding themselves to climax over the neighbors' 5 year old daughter to glance over at the animated loli ass on TV.

== Characters ==

===Professor Utonium (aka Bill Boxbody)===

[[Image:PimpinUtonium.PNG|Professor Utonium in his "lab".|thumb|Professor Utonium in his "lab".]]

Cursed with a body that had absolutely no curves whatsoever, the Professor found it impossible to find love with any women who did not have creepy right angle fetishes. [[Virgin|Unable to gain a family the normal way]], he realized that his only choice was to use [[Virgin|science]] to grow some children. He decided that the best way to do this was to toss a bunch of crap into a bowl and blindly mix it right next to a fragile glass container full of the most volatile substance known to man, [[Ecstasy|Chemical X]] . Inevitably, everything blew right the fuck up, which, if you remember your [[science|high school chemistry]], always results in little girls being born. In between pulling shards of Pyrex glass and plastic out of his body, Professor Utonium named his new daughters the Powerpuff Girls. He then later discovered that they had superpowers, making his name choice a little less retarded.

This whole thing brings up the possibility that there were less successful attempts before the Powerpuff Girls. The Utonium house's basement is most likely filled with mewling, deformed children begging for the sweet release of death. Also, the Powerpuff Girls' last name is Utonium. That's funny.

===Blossom===

The leader of the girls, Blossom, AKA Bosom, is a smarmy know-it-all gingernut who took the role of leader because Bubbles was too stupid and Buttercup was too busy fisting herself and crying while watching ''Teen Witch''. She was usually the one who came up with the plans to defeat evil, although almost all of these plans were "Beat evil about the head and face until it is bleeding and can never control its [[shit|bowels]] ever again." Blossom is most likely the one who decided that all three girls have to dress alike and color coordinate, which is why her sisters despise her so much. 

Blossom is depicted as intelligent, outgoing, and brave, and was therefore slammed as a bad role model by the few [[Christians]] who knew how to work a television.

===Bubbles=== 

Bubbles (Boobles) is the [[retard|cute]], or [[stupid]] one. High-pitched, air-headed, blond-haired and blue-eyed, Bubbles is the ideal that [[Hitler]] had striven for so many years ago. Her naivety and inability to understand how the world works made her the victim of many a villain's scheme, from being tricked into killing millions to being convinced that there are puppies and candy in a white, windowless van. She also has the ability to talk to animals, but that never did any good unless knowing where alley cats [[shit]] ever helped saved the day. [[Pedobear]] finds her the most delicious of the loli trio.

===Buttercup=== 

The [[meth|meth addict]] [[dyke|tomboy]] of the group, Buttercup (Affectionately known by the fandom as "Buttercunt")
is a bullish lesbian trapped in a world that refuses to understand or accept who she is. This caused an incredible amount of frustration and anger to build up inside of her, which would lead to her venting it in the most unhealthy way possible for a kindergarten kid with god-like powers. Oh, did you rob a bank? Well, Buttercup is going to show you what-for by slowly twisting your limbs off. You jaywalked, did you?  Buttercup will teach you a lesson by boiling the skin off of your bones with her heat vision. This sort of horrifying violence continued unchallenged through the whole series because everyone thought it was cute and not a cry for help. 
You can make any [[Wapanese | Japanese]] person cry by pointing out that Buttercup's a boy that wears dresses, technically making him [[Gay|cool]].

===[[W|Mayor]]===

The retarded leader of the City of Townsville. Can usually be seen whining about wanting his [[dongs|pickles]] or Bubbles's [[pussy|octopus]]. He cannot do anything by himself, and it's still being questioned why he's still running the town. He's voiced by [[Spongebob|Tom Kenny]], so no wonder everyone hates him.

===Miss Bellum===

The only reason to watch this shit. She has a hot body to which you can fap vigorously. You don't like her face? Well, isn't it a good thing they never show her with one. So [[Oh exploitable|paste on whatever face you want on her]].

==The Bad Guys==

===MoJoJoJoJoJoJoJoJoJo===

A big green monkey and the girls' most persistent villain.  Professor Utonium made the mistake of choosing a monkey as a lab assistant, not realizing that monkeys have a natural hatred of people made entirely of shapes.  As a result of the monkey's [[terrorist]] activities, the Powerpuff Girls were born and the monkey became green and [[Indian]].  He put on a turban and a pair of 70's boots and started a historic career of getting into fights with children.

===Fuzzy Lumpkins===

A big [[gay|pink]] hillbilly.  He spends all of his time playing the banjo, hating minorities, thumping [[Christian|bibles]], [[Incest|partying with family]], and voting for [[Sarah Palin]].  These sinister, justice-hating acts usually earned him a well-deserved beating from the Powerpuff Girls.

===The Gangrene Gang===

A gang of evil minorities whose superpower was lowering property values wherever they went.  The Powerpuff Girls would often have to chase them out of golf courses and diners at the request of the mayor. They include a [[Mexican]], a [[fat]] idiot, a [[retard]], a Jew, and your common [[douchebag]].

===[[Transvestite|"Him"]]===

A big red demon who would pass as a succubus if not for the cliche goatee. His superpowers are the same as those of [[Satan]] because he IS Satan. He fights the Powerpuff Girls for the lulz because he knows they can't actually beat him without [[God]].

===The Rowdyruff Boys===
The [[gay|male]] equivalents of the Powerpuff Girls. These little boys are subject to shitty [[LOL WUT|romantic fanfiction pairings with their enemies, The Powerpuff Girls]], from the hormonal fangirls. The most common pairings are BlossomxBrick, BubblesxBoomer, and Buttercupx[[Lesbian|Butch]].  If any of that last sentence made sense to you, you should spend at least a few seconds feeling embarrassed.

===Sedusa===
A slut who can control her hair. Her name is a combination of [[slut|"Seduce"]] and Medusa. To achieve her goals, she [[rape|rapes]] people. In animu version of Powerpuff Girls, she has bigger tits and is nymphomaniac

== [[Japan]] strikes ==

[[Image:Blossomrape.jpg|thumb|right|Blossom in anime form. Go on, fap. It's okay.]]

A maddening [[Sonic|moebius]] strip of pop culture was created when ''The Powerpuff Girls'', a show that regularly parodied anime, was made into an anime that parodied its source material. Within that insane whirlwind of double-parody and self-self referencing, the girls were given complete anime makeovers. They were given actual digits instead of the phallic nubs their limbs ended with.  Blossom was no longer smart, but the sort of sugar-obsessed girl tradition has come to expect from cartoons. Buttercup became an even bigger lesbian, but was no longer afraid to admit it. Bubbles pretty much stayed the same.

Professor Utonium was also given a son, but still no wife. His body was de-blocked in a landmark operation that required fifteen straight hours of surgery and twenty gay hours of fondling.

If the original ''Powerpuff Girls'' was like a fifth-generation inbred Floridian whore, than the Japanese version is like the child that fell out of her while she was walking around, too retarded to know that she was pregnant and not just "gettin' fat". The show was not quite as well received as one might have expected, mostly because suddenly the girls were too old for the sicko [[pedophile|fans]] of the original show to jerk off to. To the show's credit, it managed to remain significantly less [[creepy]] than the [[Bleedman]] comic, although it really would have had to work its ass off to out-creepy his work.
