'''Push Butan Receev Bacon''' [[Bear|is another one of those]] [[4Chan]] [[memes]] that originates from a pointless [[shoop da whoop|photoshop]] pasty lol-trolls create whilst waiting for their retarded mother's [[Jews|cornbread to heat up]]. [[At least 100 years ago]], like the [[The Sandwich Chef]] that preceded it, a simple panel became the source of much [[lulz]] and confusion. Well, not really - '''Push Butan Receev Bacon''' scores very low on the lulzometer because it's both boring, and not very memorable.  As such it has since been ignored off of the internet.
