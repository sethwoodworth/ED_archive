Cisco

Cisco, aka liquid crack, is a "beverage dessert wine", bottled by Canadaigua Wine in [[New York]].  If you go to their [[website]], you will get the IMPRESSION that Cisco wine is for casual sundress parties with friends and loved ones out on the patio.  This couldn't be farther from the truth.  Cisco wine is a bum wine.  It is for the lowest of the lowest of society, to go from zero to drunk in $0.99.  Its [[alcohol]] content is 18%, and is known to cause hallucinations and psychotic episodes.  Drinkers of Cisco wine have been known to [[LOL_WUT|strip naked and run down Market Street, screaming. The FTC has required the bottle to contain the warning "This is not a wine cooler -- 8 servings".  fo0bar has tried Cisco wine, and shortly later felt the urge to grab a shopping cart and fill it with garbage bags filled with old clothes and cans.

Listen for these telltale phrases:
