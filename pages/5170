Whilst MapQuest may look like a sluggishly slow mapping and directions website for [[retard|morons]] who can't afford a [[old media|Rand McNally]] atlas to use for help in finding [[pr0n]] shops and [[hookers and blow|brothels]], [[some argue]] that [[MapQuest]] is, in actuality, a [[leet|l337]] [[troll|trolling organisation]], rivaled only by [[Bantown]] and [[GNAA]] in driving people [[batshit crazy|round the bend]] and -ultimately- to [[suicide|suicide by bricks]].

MapQuest was cool until [[Google|Google Maps]] came along and pretty much kicked its ass in every way. It is now the Excite.com of map websites.
<br><br>
However, you probably know MapQuest best for getting [[you]], your [[friends]], [[your mom|your family]], the [[dog]], the [[cat]], the [[Steve Irwin|Crocodile Hunter]], Christopher Columbus, [[Hitler]], [[Rob Levin]] and [[everyone|a host of others]] completely and utterly [[lost]]. 



==The MapQuest Effect==
In fact, almost every mistake, wrong turn, [[error]] in judgement, miscalculation, [[war|woar]], crime against humanity, atrocity and just plain bad ideas (google:  [[Miltopia]] + conception) in all of human [[history]] can be blamed on bad directions -'advice' if you will- from MapQuest. And if it wasn't, one can probably get away with 'The MapQuest Excuse' for things both large and small from "MapQuest ate my homework" (in lieu of 'the dog') to "MapQuest made me do it!" (in lieu of "the voices in my head").

This was [[last thursday|recently]] [[demon]]strated in the Middle East by [[Iran|Hezbollah]], who unintentionally sparked a woar between Lebanon and [[Israel]] when they kindly stopped to give some Jew [[army|hitchers]] a ride. Unfortunately, MapQuest directed them to take the [[Jews]] hostage, deep into [[Goatse|Southern Lebanon]]. [[Israel]] responded by sending [[at least 100|at least 1,000,000]] fighter jets to bomb the shit out of [[Iran]], but again...fucking '''MapQuest!!!''' 

When the smoke cleared, much of Lebanon's infrastructure was destroyed, [[lol|mainly bridges and roads]], and estimates of [[ruin|the overall damage approached $15 billion]]. Thanks to [[MapQuest]], 1,191 [[terrorist|Lebanese civilians]] were [[pwnt|killed]] and 4,409 [[butthurt|injured]]. Also, [[YHBT|1,000,000 Lebanese were displaced and forced to flee to safer areas]]. 

On the [[Nazi|Hook-Nose]] side, 44 [[loser|civilians]] were [[banhammer|killed]] and [[at least 100|1,350]] [[butthurt|injured]]. Estimates of the number of [[winrar|Hezbollah fighters]] [[pwnt|killed]] range from 80 to 81, while 119 [[fag|IDF]] [[hippy|soldiers]] were confirmed [[banhammer|killed]] with approximately 400 [[Abner_Louima|injured]]. 

The two [[shota|young]] [[Israel|Kike]] [[pussy|soldiers]] are still [[lost|looking for the directions]] to Barney Greengrass.
