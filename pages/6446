'''Pizza''' Bombing (or any other fast food for that matter) is a lulzy way of causing grief for anyone you don't liek, all from the comfort of your Mom's basement. '''Pizza''' bombing consists of sending copious amounts of '''pizza''' or fast food to a target. The food is delivered to the target's place of residence or business where they will have to deal with a deliver order of 4 large Pepperoni's and a side of Coke and garlic bread.

== Ordering by phone ==

See [[Prank Call]] for tips on how to stay anonymous and not get angry '''pizza''' companies coming after you. Some have even convinced '''pizza''' companies to write "/b/" with the toppings and open the door screaming "POOLS CLOSED!" as was the case with [[WitnessX]], who's mom thought it was poisoned and called the cops, for epic win. Too bad it was the wrong target.

== Ordering over the Internet ==

Potentially the lulziest method, also the easiest for all you lazy fgts out there.

'''OBVIOUSLY USE [[TOR]]!!!'''

* [http://anonym.to/http://www.papajohns.com Papa Johns] - a very good site
* [http://anonym.to/http://www.dominos.com Dominos] - some people have reported this site forces Flash that bypasses proxies.  Just install [http://noscript.net/ NoScript] on Firefox and have [[Javascript]] on but flash blocked and it will not do this
* [http://anonym.to/https://quikorder.pizzahut.com/phorders2/register.php Pizza Hut] - this site was designed by evil people purely to be sadistic. 
:* Each page requires 100 megabytes to load (and you'll be squeezing that through Tor). 
:* Their page is nothing but shitty HTML and broken [[Javascript]] links.
:* Trying to order means fighting with their website literally for hours as their [[Javascript]] won't let you order anything (e.g. "Order this pizza" button just does nothing) 
:* Their popups that are uncloseable will block the screen as you have to click through tons of custom design options just to order a basic pizza. 
: By the way, be sure to register first as if you don't, you'll discover their website just won't let you finish your order or anything due to bugs so you have to clear cookies and start over.
