'''Wetlook''' is the enjoyment of a person or people wearing wet clothing, without getting naked or having sex. Devotees are mostly men. There are two separate categories of wetlook fetishism. The first group just likes to look at people in wet clothes. The second group likes to wear wet clothes. It is a sexual fetish, where the enjoyment comes from the observation of wet-clothed persons as well as getting wet oneself, but other people enjoy getting wet themselves for entirely non-sexual reasons. Many people enjoy the way as wet clothing looks, when molded to the body, as well as the way the clothing feels against the body when wet. Furthermore, light colored clothing, especially white goes transparent when wet that many people find appealing, exciting and sexy. The clothing also has a sheen to them when wet as well as change color when wet. It can also refer to clothing that is shiny in appearance and thus is termed “wet-look”.

Wetlook is often considered to be borne out of the idea that wearing clothes while swimming or bathing is forbidden, improper, or nonconformist. Those who enjoy wetlook report discovering their enjoyment at an early age, as young as five years old. Usually happening from having a wetlook experience themselves, from observing someone else getting wet or getting wet themselves. Those enjoying wetlook do so in different ways - some enjoy the act of getting wet, while others enjoy remaining wet. Some enjoy getting wet slowly, while others like the surprise. There are different kinds of jokes, where the point is how to become wetlook. For example, dunk tank. Basically, a dunk tank consists of a large tank of water, over which a seat is suspended. By striking a target, the seat will tip or fall into the tank of water, thus "dunking" whoever is sitting on the seat. Underwater shootings, swimming, posing under the water also can be considered as a way of wetlookism.
