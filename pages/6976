Ribaldry
'''Ribaldry''' ([[Wikipedia:Ribaldry|see TOW]]) is defined as one of the major categories of [[sexual]] entertainment, and is the least likely one to give you an [[orgasm]], after [[pornography]] in first place, and erotica (such as softcore porn which will get your dick hard but won't give you a good point to climax to). However, ribaldry is the one which is most likely to generate [[lulz]] and thus teh overall [[pleasure]] is often comparable with having a [[fap]] or even real [[secks]] when all the different ways in which you can enjoy yourself are compared against each other. Read on.

Since most [[chan]]ners are unemployed, [[lazy]], [[stoner]] [[alcoholic]] [[asspie]]s, they have a lot of time to masturbate. Indeed, they quite happily have enough time to masturbate when they're bored with [[no life|lots and lots of time left over still to do nothing]]. And since the chans are [[NSFW]] boards, there is nothing [[moar]] that their [[penis]]es can do once they've fapped 5 times in a day and they're still looking at porn. Therefore, they go on to [[lulz|laugh at it]].

This manifests itself within the many lulzy [[image macro]]s and [[gif]]s that are made by people on the chans, when they combine lulz with porn. (indeed, [[Jj.am]] has a huge role to play in terms of dictating the ribaldry of the [[internets]]). Ribaldry can be found in many [[shock site]]s such as [[2girls1cup]] and [[church of fudge]] because you're better to laugh at that than actually fap to it [[amirite]]? (Unless you're a [[sick fuck]], that is.)

==[[IRL]] ribaldry==
IRL ribaldry is quite [[unfunny]]. It has been known for [[at least 100 years]], even since Chaucer wrote [[shit nobody cares about|The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wife_of_Bath's_Prologue_and_Tale#Sex_and_Lollardy Even TOW knows it] "Sex and [[LOL]]-[[fat|lardy]]", [[QFT]]). Nowadays, it basically involves people talking about how they'd like to eat the [[cunt|pussy]] of the nearest [[woman]] to them whilst they are [[drunk]], offending the woman and getting her to call the [[partyvan|police]] on the [[hobo]] who made the offer.
