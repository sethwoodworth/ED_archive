Ganja Yoda
'''Ganja Yoda''' is one of the stupidest [[Advice Dog spin-offs]] that has ever been conceived. It's the product of a gaggle of retards thinking of things stoners say, rewriting it in the famous Yoda sentence structure and then using MemeGenerator to slap it onto a picture of a [[Unfunny|joint-smoking Yoda]].

Originally appearing on the 5th of Marchtember, '''Ganja Yoda''' is seen by anyone with an inkling of a sense of humor as unfunny. However, there are still potheads who claim that it's the funniest shit ever; unfortunately, these permastoned faggots often forget how little their opinions matter.
