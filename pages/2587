Economy
The '''[[shit|economy]]''' is what organizes all of mankind's productive forces to combine their efforts and produce vital stuff like porn movies or mobile phones with [[at_least_100|at least 100]] ring tones. As such it is, by definition, the sum of all [[serious business]].

The principle is essentially this: 

#X prints $10
#X loans $100 to Y
#X demands $110 from Y
#Y asks for $10 to pay the interest
#X loans $10 to Y to pay the interest
#X demands $11 from Y
#Y asks for $1 to pay the interest
#X loans $1 to Y to pay the interest
#X demands $1.10 from Y

...and so on.  This system will continue forever with no problems whatsoever.

According to movie director [[Leftard|Oliver Stone]] one of the main factors that makes the economy function is human greed. He therefore [[Butthurt|decided to make a movie]] about the [[Sin|immoral nature of capitalism]], which [[Epic Win|ironically]] drove [[Over 9000|many young people]] to become [[Jews|capitalists]].

It is theorized that the Economy was invented by extra terrestrial aliens, [[Flying Spaghetti Monster|Flying Spaghetti monsters]], and Zeus.

[[Historian]]s generally agree that the development of the economy can be divided into three phases: the [[Old]] Economy, the New Economy, and the [[Camwhore]] Economy. [[David Icke|Cutting edge thinkers]] believe we should bathe in hemp oil because soapy water causes cancer.

== The [[Old]] Economy ==

[[Image:Feudal_system.jpg|thumb|The feudal system.]]

In the days [[before the Internets]], the economy was based on what is known as the "Feudal System." In this system, the [[King]] and [[User:Girlvinyl|Queen]] [[owned]] all the land, which they then parceled out to the [[:Special:Listadmins|nobles]] [[I will have your humility|in return for their fealty]]. Everyone else were serfs or smurfs or something and didn't get [[jack]].

[[Image:Feudal system simple.JPG|thumb|In the days of old economy, this looked like a good idea.]]

===Free Markets Under the Old Economy===

[[Image:Old_economy.jpg|thumb|left|How the Old Economy worked.]]

During this period, some [[philosopher|thinkers]], such as Adam Smith and [[Ayn Rand]], [[some argue|argued]] in favor of a "free market," because a free market is, [[liek]], a market, and &mdash; it's ''free!'' That does sound good, yes, but, unfortunately, it turns out that this doesn't mean [[free|"free" as in "not costing anything."]]  Nor, apparently, does it mean [[Free Software Foundation|"free" as in "freedom."]] Rather, it means "free" [[shit nobody cares about|in some other complicated sense nobody really understands]].

In any case, no free market was ever created during this period, because all markets were under the secret control of the [[Jews]].

== The New Economy ==

[[Image:New_economy.jpg|thumb|left|How the New Economy worked.]]

The [[Internets]] were invented by [[why do you hate freedom?|freedom-hater]] [[Al Gore]] and were controlled, in their early days, by the Defense Department &mdash; a well-known nest of secret [[anti-American]] subversives.[http://wwx2.tripod.com/mccarthy.html] Commercial use was therefore strictly prohibited (and in [[fact]] the ".com" suffix originally stood, not for "commercial," but for "[[communist]]"). All of that changed, however, [[at least 100 years ago|one fine day in 1994]], when the courageous "Green Card Lawyers," [[Cthulhu|Darth Canter and Dartha Siegel]], sent out their pathbreaking [[spam]] to the assembled [[nerd]]s of [[Usenet]]. This resulted in great rejoicing, as well as in [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.syntax.tactical/browse_thread/thread/5cd5b91558cb0f32/0626c191b823f549?lnk=st&q=&rnum=1&hl=en#msg_0626c191b823f549 the birth of the New Economy].

===Free Markets Under the New Economy===

[[Image:Jews_control_new_economy.jpg|thumb|OMG secret Jewish Internets. Moreover: [[lol]], Gopher.]]

Under the New Economy markets were no longer controlled by the [[Jews]], but rather by a mysterious force known as the [[Jews|Invisible Hand]]. This [[some argue|led some to conclude]] that truly free markets were now possible for the first time. The main [[idiot|believers in this theory]] were the so-called "day traders," who hoped to [[EXTREME ADVERTISING|MAKE MONEY FAST]] by buying shares in ridiculous, no-future, loss-making dot-com ventures such as [[LiveJournal]] and [[Apple]]. In the end, unsurprisingly, [[Special:Listadmins|the inside elite]] kept all the [[money]] and the "day traders" were left with [[jack]].

=== <span id="Economist_Magazine"></span>The ''Economist''  Magazine ===

[[Image:Great_tits.jpg|thumb|Only the highest of highbrow [[humor]] over there at the ''Economist''.]]

This international magazine served as an inspiration to Canter and Siegel, and to the New Economy as a whole, due to its convincing argument that problems such as hunger, war, disease, and [[419|AN UNCLAIMED SUM OF $10,000,000 (TEN MILLION U.S. DOLLARS) LEFT IN SECRET ACCOUNTS BY THE LATE PRESIDENT, GENERAL SANI ABACHA]] could be eliminated at a single stroke if only the barriers to [[spam|world trade]] were brought down. Nowadays, however, the ''Economist'' is known for loving [[open source]] software and hating [[teh]] [[Microsoft]] and [[teh]] [[SCO]]. This, of course, is a blatant [[contradiction]].

The ''Economist'' is also known for publishing, each week, an editorial [[cartoon]] which is not only extremely well drawn but also bafflingly, mind-bogglingly [[unfunny]].

== The [[Camwhore]] Economy ==

The New Economy ended [[last Thursday|sometime in 2000]] when it was suddenly discovered that, whereas Old Economy businesses were all built out of "bricks and mortar," the New Economy had been using [[bullshit|a more flexible building material]]. This was known as the "dot com bust."

[[Image:Tableshoehatonhead.jpg|thumb|left|How the Camwhore Economy works.]]

[[Image:Good Economics.jpg|thumb|right|Sounds good to me.]]

The immediate result of this was that [[at least 100|thousands]] of workers in Silicon Valley and [[San Francisco]] suddenly found themselves laid off from their cushy, all-casual-dress, skateboard-around-the-office, unlimited-free-Nacho-Cheese-flavored-[http://www.doritos.com Doritos &reg;] [[jobs]]. But [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.furry/msg/21391850df744e31?dmode=source&hl=en the entrepreneurial spirit soon reasserted itself] and rebuilt yet another New Economy on the ashes of the old.

Given the nature of its architects, it is only natural that the mainstay of this New New Economy (if you will) was getting [[16 year old girl]]s to show their [[boob]]s [[OL]].

On a happier note, however: despite the unfortunate success of the Camwhore Economy, [http://chris-landslide.livejournal.com/342.html furries still get fired].

===Free Markets Under the Camwhore Economy===

Besides the [[Camwhore]]s themselves (and of course the [[porn]]ography industry), the main bastion of free market [[capitalism]] [[now|in today's world]] is [[eBay]]. Despite the continued opposition of [[Bill Gates]], [[RMS]], and [[Joseph Stalin]], eBay has succeeded in bringing [[P-p-p-powerbook|the benefits of international free trade]] to us all.

==Economics as a Drama-Generating Technique==

This is just too obvious, and also too easy, like taking [[candy]] from a [[baby]]. But try, for example, accusing someone of committing the "Lump of Labor" fallacy, or some [[gay]] shit like that (and don't forget to also [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.politics.immigration/tree/browse_frm/thread/9ec4174fdd493db0/7b0c1d449f82f729?rnum=41&hl=en&_done=%2Fgroup%2Falt.politics.immigration%2Fbrowse_frm%2Fthread%2F9ec4174fdd493db0%2F65d61bc29c1a7b55%3Ftvc%3D1%26hl%3Den%26#doc_8382dfc9617b7525 flame his spelling]). Or try telling a bunch of [[woman|hysterical]] [[fucktard]]s that they should like [[Wal-Mart]] because it creates jobs.[http://community.livejournal.com/anti_sweatshops/2150.html#t7782] If you come across a math type then one can ask for a mathematical proof of the viability of the fractional reserve system under dynamic conditions. When one needs to end an argument and return his broker's margin call, one need simply post high-resolution pictures of gold, guns, or ammo and pawn any economic argument.

The best thing about economics is that, even though it's supposedly a "science", it's mostly just making shit up and finding evidence that agrees with the shit you made up, so you can always use it to support your point of view.  Make sure to tell anyone who disputes you to "read an economics textbook some time", because you know they won't and they won't be able to prove that you haven't either.

==Drama-Generation as an Economic System==

Despite the [[fail|attempts]] of many to turn the [[internets]] into a [[cock|tool]] for capitalism, it's [[truth|true]] economy has always remained loyal to ideals of the [[Dramacratic]] Trolligarchy, revolving around the import of services in the form of [[drama]] and export of goods in the form of [[original content]], utilizing [[lulz]] as a standardized [[Jew gold|currency]].

When [[you|one]] considers that the [[internets]] [[nothing|export much less]] than they import (due largely to the [[fact]] that most imported drama comes in the form of unwitting donations), it is easy to see why this economic system continues to endure, as the [[netizen|netizenry]] end up much [[Lie|richer for the arrangement]].
