90 Day Jane
90 Day Jane is/was [[stupid]] [[emo]]-[[cunt]] [[internet]] [[attention whore]] who pledged to end her life in <STRIKE>[http://90dayjane.blogspot.com/ 90 days]</STRIKE> (blog deleted. See: The Game Is Up!).  She opted to use blogspot for cataloging her diatribe and was quoted as saying the following on her profile:

{{tinyquote|I am going to kill myself in 90 days. What else should i say? This blog is not a cry for help or even to get attention. It's simply a public record of my last 90 days in existence. I'm not depressed and nothing extremely horrible has lead me to this decision. But, does it really have to? I mean, as an [[atheist]] I feel life has no greater purpose. My generation has had [http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Fight-Club.html no great depression, no great war] and our biggest obstacle is beating Halo 3. So, if I feel like saying "game over", why can't I? Anyway, I hope you enjoy my thoughts as the clock runs out. Also, if blogspot takes this down before i'm gone just go to www.90dayjane.com. Please don't attempt to "help" me. If you want to truly help, please send me ideas on how to do the deed. thx-Jane}}

== The Story == 
She attracted a fair amount of attention very quickly, much more than she wanted, or so she claimed. Her [[whining]] talked about how suicidal people seem to shave their heads and or faces in the movies, what she was going to do with all her [[shit]], and mentioning the fact that she'd even bought a dress for the occasion. She enabled comments on her entries, meaning that various netizens were kind enough to either try and talk her out of it, call her a [[stupid]] [[cunt]], encourage her to do it RIGHT AWAY instead of waiting, and just outright mockery. The comments themselves were more of a [[lulz|lolfest]] than her entries, which were about as exciting as Bucharest on a Monday night.  Since she deleted the blog, all entries and comments are no longer viewable, but we have captured some of them here. 

A particularly helpful netizen called jessiKa, made a very pretty picture just for the occasion, labeling her for what she is, a vapid and [[whining|pathetic]] [[attention whore]].  The irony of this article being here in response to her being one has not escaped us, but the potential [[lulz]] from such an event cannot go ignored. 

Jane requested that rather than people trying to save her, that they offer up ideas on how she should do the deed, and someone suggested she created a live [http://www.ustream.tv UstreamTV channel] for the last month of her journey, so that we could all have a laugh at her expense and perhaps witness the grand finale itself. Later on down the line, she was allegedly approached by a TV network.

{{quote|I've received some wonderful emails from individuals, but also media outlets. Many of them have been respectful and simply asked questions or for perhaps an interview. Which is understandable even though I am declining to be interviewed.

Then I got this email from a HUGE television network.|}}

== Dressing For The Occasion ==
Jane bought a new frock for the event itself, and documented such on the wonderful [[YouTube|JewTube]].

== Stop The Blog I Want To Get Off! ==
As a result of all the heckling and not very nice comments from the oh so helpful netizens, five days into her countdown she considered [http://90dayjane.blogspot.com/2008/02/day-85-stop-this.html stopping her blog,] and stated the following:
{{quote|Ok, let's be real. I read your comments and a lot of you have been emailing me.

I really want to reiterate that this is a public but anonymous record and was not meant to be a big thing. I didn't think anyone would find it or even care if they did. I guess I was wrong.

Honestly, I've been thinking about stopping the blog.

Usually I go online to distract myself from my problems, not be faced with more. Yes, this is my fault. I can accept that. The internet is completely unpredictable and I have put myself out there. Unintentional or not, I made my bed and now I have to lie in it. I don't expect any pity here.

So, as it stands now, I won't be changing the direction it has taken.
Also, enjoy this wonderful pic that "jessiKa" emailed to me. I actually thought it was funny.|}}

Clearly what this [[dumb]] [[bitch]] needed was a good [[rape|raping]], and a nice syrupy [[dong]] in the mouth, rinse and repeat as necessary.  Since this was all a huge [[emo]] stunt whether she was dead or not, she still needs a damned good slap for [[EPIC FAIL|EPIC FAILURE]].

== The Game Is Up! ==
One of her commenters posted (anonymously of course) the following:
{{tinyquote|Anonymous said..."90 Day Jane" is a production of two Hollywood wanna-be people -- a woman and her current boyfriend (the guy who's doing some of the camera work in her video). He's also responsible for writing some of the site (or at least did so for a bit).  How do I know all this?  Because I know "Jane" personally and although she'd kill me to say this, I think this is f**** up beyond belief, even for her.......}}

'''On the date of 13th February 2008, 90dayjane posted the following bag of [[shit|shite]] in her [[blog]]:'''

''"90DayJane is a personal art piece about me. It was meant for me and (what I ignorantly thought would be) a small number of people who might find it on BlogSpot. It is the result of me tapping into the darkest part of myself and seeing where it led.  What I have written and filmed, at its core, is from a place of truth. I am the girl in the videos. I have great disappointment with my generation and its obvious obsession with celebrity culture rather than their fellow man, thus the former Chuck Palahniuk reference.''

''I wanted this blog to be about personal discovery and truth. But the correspondences I have received have taught me more about those qualities than I could ever express. 90DayJane has become its own entity and has influenced me. In fact, it has changed my perspective as a human being.  I feel a massive sense of responsibility to my art, but more importantly the readers of this blog. My closeness to this project must have made art seem like reality to many people. That is not a reaction that I expected nor can I morally justify. This is why my project, 90DayJane, will be taken down in the next few hours. 
''

''90DayJane was meant to mirror the tragic figure, Christine Chubbuck. Newscaster Christine Chubbuck committed suicide in 1974 by shooting herself in the head live on air. She was very vocal about her depression to those around her and gave every indication of her exact intentions leading up to the event. Sadly, no one reacted or helped Christine and those left behind could only ask "why". 
''

''Her story both inspired and terrified me because I can truly empathize with her rage and even her isolation. I wondered how Christine's life and subsequent suicide would play out in our time. Would the internet be yet another place of isolation to her or an escape? If she remained vocal about her intentions would anyone bother asking "why" or even noticing before the fact? Would the reaction (if any) of the public change her intentions?
I thought this mirror might reflect the isolation everyday people feel and the lack of true human connection on the internet.''


''It is my feeling that the internet is the best and worst example of human interaction. This was painfully proven to me by reading every comment and every email. I believe I owed that to everyone. I know we all saw the dark side of the reactions in the blog comments. There was so much hate, immaturity and apathy. But, I truly wish everyone could see the beauty and honesty in the emails; many people feel like Jane (me). People have been more real and heartfelt than I thought was possible. I owe them a debt of gratitude for showing me the difference between people's reactions and their true feelings. I understand.''


''I do want everyone to know that I accepted no money for 90DayJane despite multiple offers from television, film, books, etc... I will not release my identity and I ask not to be contacted for any type of promotion. I want only for the people who wrote to me to know that I hear them and feel the same way. Your emails touched me so much. Please, share your thoughts with someone in your life or express them in a positive way.


''To everyone, please reach out to those around you. It's much harder to ask for help than to offer it.''


''In the video above I created a PostSecret revealing this project for what it is. I am in no way affiliated with them, but their site does great work for suicide outreach. At any rate, PostSecret gives me both strength and perspective whenever I read it. I hope it does the same for you.
''

''thx- 90DayJane''

'''Again, the blog in its entirety was removed before we had a chance to grab it. From the very beginning, this was either going to be an actuality, or a stunt to see how many people would run with it.  It didn't however last very long either way, and proved to be a pathetic [[emo]] stunt on behalf of other [[emo]] kids, or [[emo]] kids who have already killed themselves (thank fucking god).'''
