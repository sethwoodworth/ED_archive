'''Waco (moar like Wacko, [[amirite|amirite?]]) was the most famousest of all the [[Texas]] BBQs.''' [[9/11|On February 28th, 1993]], the small town of Waco, [[Texas]] was host to the '''Waco Siege''' (a.k.a. '''''[[Janet Reno]][[Saturday Night Live|'s REAL Dance Party]]'''''), a [[BBQ]] of EPIC proportions, when the [[Habbo Hotel|compound]] of the [[Christian]] '''Branch Davidian''' [[cult]] got [[pwnt]] by US Attorney General and part-time male impersonator [[Janet Reno]], leading a combined ATF/[[FBI]] [[Party Van|raid]] to troll [[batshit crazy]] leader '''David Koresh''' into giving up teh loli. That and the ''totally legal'' 150 [[guns|assault rifles]] and 8,000 rounds of ammunition in the complex.

Her [[leet|1337]] [[IRL trolling]] skills resulted in complete pwnage and ended with the [[permaban]] of 4 raiding [[FBI|fedpigs]], 87 [[True Believers|true believers]] (including 25 [[children]], 2 [[fetus]]es) and Koresh himself, after an [[win|EPIC]] 51-day [[raid]]. 

[[Irony|Ironically]], the 'official' pretext for the raid was to prevent another [[Jonestown]] where [[at least 100|over 900]] [[true believers]] [[suicide|self pwnt]] themselves. It worked. The FBI was successful in stopping anyone from committing suicide. By murdering them first. God bless the USA.  

==In AD 1993 War Was Beginning== 
[[Image:Dietcult.jpg|thumb|right|Good shopping in Waco]]
Like many other pro-firearm [[conservative]] [[Christians]] who endlessly harp on the Second Amendment, the Branch Davidians were as right-wing as it gets and hated the [[United States|US]] government with a passion.

The Branch Davidians started in the 1930's when a bunch of Seventh Day Adventist kooks decided that the Seventh Day Adventist [[church]] was not crazy or [[lulz|lulzy]] enough for them.  They moved from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], which was also not lulzy enough for them. Away from the sin and vice that only a city composed largely of [[Mexican|Mexicans]] in zoot suits and cowboy hats, clear-speaking black person, and [[atheist|godless]] [[gay]] [[Jews]]. They moved to [[Texas]], where everything is pretty much okay and everything is bigger except [[penis|penes]]. 

Koresh took over the role of "the Messiah reborn" by [[troll|challenging]] the Davidians' previous messianic leader to a contest to see which one of them could be the first to raise a person from the dead. Koresh did not actually participate, but instead called on the previous leader and had him arrested for [[necrophilia|desecrating a corpse]]. Thus, Koresh became the new leader; or as he preferred to be called, "Christ 2: Electric Bugaloo". 

Strangely enough, David was also a fantastic [[masturbation|guitar player]] and had some [[old meme|excellent rock and roll songs]]. Srsly.

So they build this big [[Habbo Hotel|compound]], which they called the International House of David. Unlike the International House of ''Pancakes'', which serves up Texas-style pancakes, grits, and burgers 24/7; the IHOD served up Texas-style [[anal sex|buttsechs]], [[baby fuck|baby fuckin']], and [[pedophile|child molestin']] with a side of [[Jesus]].

==What Happen?==

In 1992, the [[ATF]] stopping lovingly stroking and polishing each other's [[penis|military style rifles]] long enough to hear prolonged bursts of automatic gunfire coming from IHOD.  Figuring they were having a [[Counterstrike]] [[unicorn orgy|LAN party]] with a really awesome [[audiophile|surround sound system]], they decided to go to IHOD and see [[wtf]] was up.  Being avid [[cosplay|cosplayers]], they came in real mil-spec anti-terrorism gear, complete with blue ripstop BDU's, Kevlar helmets, body armor, light guns that looked like real M16A2s, MP5s and Glock 19s, as well as dummy flashbangs. As the list of ordinance demonstrates, the safety of the civilians inside clearly came first. 

The FBI then drove to a local Safeway in their own trucks, pulling cattle trailers, since the vans and humvees the ATF provided were [[moar|not adequate]]. They loaded up plenty of Tecate and Bud Light, tortilla chips, salsa, frozen pizzas, and flammable tear gas.  

Unfortunately, the gunfire was not actually a LAN party, but a bunch of [[survivalist]] sociopaths with [[Asperger's]] preparing for the [[Bill Clinton|apocalypse]]. Their leader, David Koresh, had long taught that someday, the [[government|gummint]] would send a bunch of [[ATF]] agents to storm IHOD and force them at gunpoint to knock off all the [[sick fuck|completely normal, morally upright behavior]] in which they were engaged, and give up all their cool guns. Had he not be burned to death by the FBI, he might have been able to remark, "told ya so!"

The [[ATF]] came to the porch ready to [[Grunge|rock and roll]] ''with'' the Branch Davidians, but instead were greeted with a lot of [[Black Metal|full-metal]] [[pwnage]]. The ATF agents said [[WTF]] and proceeded to try to radio the communications officer, which was unsuccessful, as he had turned his radio off to [[masturbate|stroke]] his [[harbl]]. When he finally wiped the jizz off his hands and turned it back on, they informed him that there was a good-old, [[dark age]]-style castle raid taking place and that they were getting [[pwnt]].  Upon hearing this, the communications officer cried, "'''NO WAI!!!'''"  The ATF responded "[[ya rly]]," so he immediately got on [[AIM]] and [[IRC]] to get some real guns over there as well as an extra [[server]] or two.

==Someone Set Up us The FBI==
[[Image:PARTY VAN TIEM.jpg|thumb|left|<b>OLIOLIOLIOOO!</b>]][[Image:Gonnagetus.gif|thumb|right|250px|Government, Don't mess with it.]]

After Round 1 had ended, 3 ATF agents had been [[dead|permabanned IRL]] and another 22 had gotten shot in the [[cock]], but they had only managed to [[pwn]] 6 Branch Davidians in the process. A 2 to 1 ratio is unacceptable, so the FBI [[admin]] stepped in and dedicated a few servers to successfully taking IHOD. 

The FBI set up shop, the Branch Davidians decided to use [[basement dweller|camping]] as a counter tactic, and a 51 day standoff ensued.  The FBI sent agent Jeff Jamar, who had previously successfully made [[an hero]] out of three other people suffering from [[Christian|Jesus Syndrome]] in Ruby Ridge six months earlier; to similarly make [[an hero]] out of each and every Branch Davidian.  This is, of course, because the [[government|gummint]] is controlled by [[liberal]] [[gay]] [[Jews]] from [[Massachusetts]] who hated the obvious righteousness of David Koresh, lord and savior.

[[leftard|Half]] of the FBI thought that the best solution was nonviolence and negotiation. That anyone gullible enough to believe a failed [[attention whore|rock star]] who looked like [[Howard Stern]] on a bad day was the messiah, was already leading a life even the FBI couldn't make worse.

The [[Neo-con|other half]] thought that the best course of action would be to get as many [[Fox News|reporters]] on the scene as possible and have a 24-hour, up-to-the-minute broadcast of every tactic the FBI was going to attempt so that the rest of America could see how badass they were, followed eventually by ''[[Ragnarok]]''.

To prepare for this, the FBI borrowed nine tanks and five CEV's from the Army.  A CEV is what happens when a [[killdozer|tank fucks a bulldozer]]. They then proceeded to host a monster truck rally in the front of the IHOD using David Koresh's cars, which '''pissed the hell''' out of Davey Koresh.  They also borrowed some [[fursuit|fursuits]] from the Anti-[[Furggotry]] wing of the Delta Force's [[l33t]] closet, in preparation for the attempt to [[lul]] them out of their [[basement]].

They also set up a bunch of loudspeakers and would repeatedly [[fan art|fart]] into a microphone fed through a distortion pedal at inopportune moments; such as when Davey was taking a leak, which caused him to [[lol|giggle furiously]]. The convulsing motion causing his [[w|flaccid penis]] to jerk about, getting fresh messianic [[piss]] all over his bathroom, to his consternation.

He then had to get a few [[16 year old girl|16 year old girls]] to lick it up, which meant that they couldn't be sucking his dick at the same time. Because of this, he decided to [[IRL troll|troll the radio]], angrily lamenting how the government was a bunch of [[Hitler|Hitlers]] and could they please stop shooting at us? No? Oh ok then.

==All Your Church Are Belong To Us==
Finally, after 51 days of not shooting anyone, the FBI was starting to get really bored. At the same time, Koresh had [[raped]] or [[almost raped]] every loli in the IHOD, and was also getting really bored.  He was forced to turn to his stack of old issues of ''Time'' Magazine and read about [[leftard|Jan Palach]] and [[azn|Thích Quảng Ðức]],and thought to himself, "If I ever decide to become [[an hero]] I'm going to do it that way."

[[lesbian|Janet Reno]] was getting really bored too, and after listening over and over to the song "Eat The Baby" by psychobilly band '''The Meteors''', decided that they may be on to something.  Not realizing that this was just [[republican|an joke]], she contacted [[Bill Clinton]] who, being a black person, agreed on the condition that at least a couple of then were batter fried, and that they could throw some [[weed]] in there, too.  At this, she started hatching plans on how to best go about barbecuing the 25 children in the compound.  She ordered the tanks and CEV's fitted with lazors, and for as many tanks of propane and bottles of Bullseye BBQ sauce as possible to be shipped to Waco immediately.

The plan originally was to poke holes inside the IHOD, which was divided into three sectors.  Helicopters were to air drop mesquite and hickory into sectors one and two, while a tank would deposit a ton of the finest quality Afghani bud the law could confiscate onto section three. After which a fire would be started in the ground floor, all the exits sealed, and then [[Bill Clinton]]and some [[whores]] would stand on the roof, getting the best high ever. The Guinness Book of World Records was on hand to certify the FBI as having created the biggest bong ever.

Unfortunately, David Koresh, believing that "drugs are bad", didn't inhale. Janet Reno freaked the hell out that someone could pass up the chance to get that high and ordered all [[hell]] to break loose.

Agents say Branch Davidian members ignited the fires, alleging that observers saw a [[men in black|man dressed in black]] bend over with cupped hands and then saw him wipe the cum off his mouth with his sleeve and return to work, being payed [[at least 100]] dollars an hour to be a tool of the Zionist government and create all sorts of comic Jew mischief

This is later identified as the mirth of a nation, inflated at the sight of their president and vice president using the world's biggest bong and then laughing jovially.  They were seen to be competing to see who could hold it in the longest, and Clinton lost when Al Gore said "Hey now, Bill, don't [[blowjob|inhale]]" causing him to let loose and croak, "[[dude]], [[fuck]] [[you]].  haha."

==Aftermath and Cultural Impact==
[[Image:Waco burns time.jpg|thumb|right|<b>CULTURAL IMPACT!</b>]]
The night of April 19th, Bill Clinton appeared on air and, typical of his normal nightly broadcasts to the American public, quickly stripped off his pants; revealing a rather small, but swollen erection.

Clinton then sat on the desk in the oval office, threw his legs as far as they would go behind his head and attempted to bend over far enough to get his penis into his mouth, because sure as hell Hillary wasn't going to do it. When it became obvious that this was not going to happen, Janet Reno came onscreen, her large, deflated breasts swinging freely; a large, black, freshly lubed dildo between her legs; and proceeded to take Clinton from behind. She then pumped Clinton for ten minutes, demanding to know the location of the Jade Donkey. 

Clinton finally gasped, "It's right here" and laid back so that his erect penis was pointing to the sky, mimicking the Washington Monument in the background. Reno then straddled him and proceeded to bounce up and down, his Presidential Peener alternately penetrating her vagina and ass, before he finally shot a load of steaming presidential jizz all over the desk. This was one of the busiest nights ever for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline, and the incident, set in slow motion to Massive Attack's "Angel," remains one of the most widely viewed videos on [[YouTube]]. The incident garnered wide applause from liberal Europe (because they thought Clinton was fucking another dude); the Middle East (because they though Clinton was fucking a camel); and anyone who like granny porn (self explanatory).

The UN gave the burning of a church a standing ovation when it was brought before the council for human rights, and proceeded to ask if there were any leftovers, [[lulz]]. When it was admitted that the Branch Davidians had already been devoured, most of the UN said "it's cool bro, we know, we were just fuckin' with yuz."  However, Yassir Arafat of the [[Arab|Arabs]] blamed this on the Jews and immediately ordered [[at least 100]] school buses filled with Jew larvae to be immediately blown up in retribution.  Clinton said "[[WTF]]" and invited both Arafat and arch rival, Yitzhak Rabin, to the White House to do blow off the asses of hookers together.  What followed this was six years of peace in Israel, all because of the events that transpired in a small town called Waco, Texas.

Gulf War Veteran and [[KKK member]]] Timothy McVeigh became an [[terrorist|hero]] two years later on April 19, 1995, when he bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, OK in retaliation for the events at Waco. He did this because Oklahoma is a [[liberal]] state filled with [[Jews]].  Not a single [[conservative]] [[Christian]] who voted [[Republican]] died in this attack.  Timmy Boy thought he got vengeance and lulz for his actions, but the lulz were on him, when he was sentenced to die by [[rape|ass rape]] which was carried out over the course of six months by [[gay]] [[black]] [[Jews]].

The record for "World's Biggest Bong" continued to stand until [[9/11|September 11th, 2001]] when [[Osama Bin Laden]] took the title, creating ''two'' much larger bongs out of the World Trade Center in [[New York]], NY.

===Teh [[Internets]] Weigh In===

Many survivalists, [[Alex_Jones | conspiracy theorists, and pedophiles]] cried about the whole incident, citing that the government used "pyrotechnic devices" that caused the fire, thus murdering Koresh.  However they fail to realize that having a complex wall to wall with stockpiles of fuel (lol [[retard|survivalism]]) is a extreme fire hazard brought on by themselves, not to mention that they were totally [[asking for it]].  Another claim is that besides brainwashing & fucking underage girls, fortifying the complex & stockpiling weapons, leading a cult that refused to surrender, and firing upon federal agents; they were [[Victim complex|'''perfectly innocent law-abiding citizens''']].  All this drama is basically a grown up version of your average [[13 year old boy]] screaming "BULLSHIT CAMPING FAG[[oneoneone|1111]]" when you killed them on [[Xbox|Xbox live]]. 

The anonymous freedom of the [[internets]] has given all these [[retard|people]] a [[forum]] in which to [[troll|verbalize]], endlessly, their "views" on the "truth," which would be [[lulz|fucking hilarious]] if it was not for the fact that people '''actually believe''' the above, are [[butthurt]] about it, and own guns themselves.  Insanity LOVES [[LiveJournal|company]], and whereas for a few years, this company was limited to the town watering hole and a pitcher of beer, these people now can swap their "observations" and "theories" on what happened with one another nationwide.

[[Srsly]] though, if you go and buy three firearm magazines this month, at least one of them will have an op-ed in which the [[retard]] writer, invariably a [[fat]] [[white]] guy from a state like [[shit nobody cares about|Nebraska or Iowa]] that's positively '''filled''' with degenerate minorities and sexual deviants - who is obviously [[l33t|in the know]] - will make some off-the-cuff remark about how "our government's actions against a small church in Waco, TX, will not go forgotten" and "nor will their oppression of a small group of patriots who were murdered in Ruby Ridge, ID," either.  This can be taken as proof that there is an unsettling number of people in the [[United States]] who are [[batshit crazy]].  Our only hope is to get [[Bill Clinton|Premier Bill Clinton]] back to rule this country with an iron phallus and create a few more barbecues [[for great justice]].  [[Desu]]!
