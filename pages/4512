'''Kawaii''' (可愛い) is a term that means, "cute" in Japanese. A term [[DO NOT WANT|abused]] by [[Wapanese]] fags and my dad's cock, I call "it" weeaboo, and for those who are blissfully unaware, in Japan, no one who is either male or a girl over the age of 12 uses the word, but '''I''' do. Many hope that all of America's "[[otaku]]" are deported to Japan, like they apparently want, and then are all committed to mental wards for acting like [[retard]]ed children. Things that are considered "kawaii" are [[bishounen]], [[chibi]]s, cosplayers, and [[Mary Sue|extremely]] [[slash|shitty]] [[fanfic]]s written by nearly illiterate [[wapanese]]. Wapanese enjoy screaming "kawaii!!!!!!!!!11!!111" at the top of their lungs at anything that moves. Scientists are looking into and believe it might be a mating call to attract other Wapanese.

Every time you say kawaii, your [[Pingas]] shrinks.
