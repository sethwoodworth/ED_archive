The Throw
'''The Throw''' is a technique used by particularly calculating and experienced [[trolls]] during [[flamewar]]s to make their opponent lower their defense and provide fodder for their own degradation.  So-named by the [[martial arts]] [[cliche]] of offering a handshake, then dramatically throwing the person to the ground.  This is usually done by feigning [[Asking for it|vulnerability]] on your part, thus prompting your opponent to do the same.  But when they bare their [[fursona|soul]] to you, trash it with everything you've got.

An example of a basic Throw:

  Prima and Secunda have been flamewarring for some time.
  
  Prima: Hey, I'm sorry about being such a dick about this, my girlfriend dumped me yesterday
  and I've just been sad and angry ever since ;_;
  
  Secunda: Oh, sorry. Well you're lucky, I've never even had a girlfriend.
  
  Prima: HAHAHA OMG YOU FUKKEN [[loser|LOSER]] GO KILL YOURSELF!!!

The throw's most important feature is that it becomes more effective the more you know about your opponent.  Reading their [[LJ]] or [[MySpace]] can help but observing what they post in the given community is usually best.  Find out what their personality is and how it can be exploited. A Throw need not be done with [[Emo|emotional]] [[crap]] either, anything that will provoke a [[serious business|serious]] response from the target can potentially be used to throw them.

It is very easy for a Throw to backfire, only use it if you [[Zero Wing|know what you are doing]].  Firstly, your opponent may not take the bait because they've either [[old meme|seen it before]] or [[Aspie|have no emotions]].  Always have a good [[NO U|comeback]] ready for what they may say when they spot your [[trap]].  Also, if you're too insistent in trying to badger something personal out of the target, you may appear [[creepy]] and like you think [[the Internet is serious business]], and those who may have supported you in your [[lulz|righteous endeavor]] might turn against you.

It is the mark of a master troll (or sometimes a [[Knuffy|really dumb target]]) to execute a Throw more than once on the same person.

It should be noted that not everyone seen showing weakness in a flamewar is attempting a Throw.  They might just be a [[pussy]].
