When art imitates life, you can be sure there will be [[Faux News|people too stupid to understand]].  Fox managed to take a breath between selling the actual war and making shit up to interview one Karen Meredith, a video game expert and Gold Star Mom whose son died in the [[Iraq]] War.

The [[UK]] defence secretary (lol, spelling) Liam Fox (lol, Fox) was [http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/defence-secretary-calls-for-medal-of-honor-boycott-711738 up in arms] about the content.

In response, [http://www.medalofhonor.com/multiplayer EA even sets up to pretend they're not Taliban.]  [[No|Will they sell it now]]?

===Release===

If all the pre-release hoopla weren't enough, EA had some tricks up it's sleeve for the actual game release.  In order to hype the release EVEN MOAR than they previously had, a midnight release was planned.  Pre-order customers, who were stupid enough to believe the Jew lies, thought they'd be able to download the game AT MIDNIGHT, just like the jobless [[basement dwellers]] who were lining up at their local [[Gamestop]]s.  In fact, these [[sucker|special pre-orders]] were told they would have to wait another 16 hours just to start downloading, let alone playing.  Sixteen hours later, there were no downloads to be had.  A message was left on the forum stating that "[there was] something wrong with the file."  [[Rage]] ensued.

PS3 users complained that the single-player game kept crashing their consoles.  Xbox players cried that the multiplayer sign-on screen hung up their machines.  On the rare occasion that one could actually connect to a populated server, there was plenty of lag to be had for all.  The hit detection was so far off that it was common to get shot around corners.  All of this, coupled with the fumbled release, was too much for some gamers, who ran back to Gamestop to piss away a couple more of their parents dollars.

Once the PC gamers finally downloaded, installed, upgraded [[Punkbuster]] manually, uninstalled, re-downloaded, reinstalled, re-checked Punkbuster, uninstalled, then reinstalled again with a lower version of DirectX, the gamers found themselves in [[Juba the Baghdad Sniper|a world of hurt.]] 

However, this is all mostly general stuff, now lets get into the specifics..

[[Idiot|Out of respect]] for the soldiers in [[Afghanistan]], [[Electronic Arts|DICE]] decided to give this game a multiplayer. Medal of Honor 2010's multiplayer is the disgusting, nauseating bastard child of [[Battlefield: Bad Company 2]]'s and [[Modern Warfare 2]]'s multiplayer. It features many recycled sounds and game mechanics from [[Battlefield: Bad Company 2|Bad Company 2]], some of those game mechanics having already been stolen from CoD. The graphics also aren't as good as Bad Company's. According to [[Retard|most of the people who play the multiplayer]], it is the most [[Lie|tactical, realistic, skill-based, and totally noob free multiplayer to ever be created by anyone that will keep you interested for years and years to come]]. [[Lie|ITS SPAWN SYSTEM IS FUCKING FLAWLESS, AND KILLING PEOPLE AND STAYING ALIVE IS A REAL CHALLENGE THAT ONLY HARDENED, SKILLED PLAYERS WILL BE ABLE TO DO EFFECTIVELY, AS THIS GAME'S LEARNING CURVE IS VERY HIGH! NO COD FAGS ALLOWED!]]

Lol, jk.

'''First Beta'''

After playing the first beta for 5 minutes, it was already easy to see that this game was going to be the epitome of fail. The guns had no recoil ([[Fail|this hasn't changed]]), the game froze every time you died, and there were glitches galore, which there still are. Not much else to say here, it sucks.

'''Second "Beta"'''

It wasn't REALLY a beta, but more a [[Fail|4 day demo of the game]]. Although a few major glitches had been fixed, [[Obvious|it was still bad, of course]].


'''The Weapons'''

In Medal of Honor 2010, there are less than 20 guns to choose from. You know what that means asshole? It means that [[Modern Warfare 2]] has more guns than this game does. Like [[Modern Warfare 2]], every single gun in this game has no recoil and can be easily be used to [[Troll|kill]] people (while shooting full-auto) from across the god damn map ([[Fail|this includes pistols]]), which is actually not that amazing considering that the maps are about as big as an [[asian]] man's penis. Some retards will say that you need to burst in order to accomplish this, but in reality, you don't. To add this, all of the guns perform the same and all kill instantly. They also all sound the same, each using the same uniform BOOM BOOM BOOM sound to give the guns a more [[Gay|manly]] feel. Then you have the explosives, which includes C4, grenades, grenade lawn chairs, and rocket lawn chairs, all of which do little to no damage, with the grenade only able to be thrown 3 feet with a fuse of 0.5 seconds. Last but not least, the reticle for the guns while firing from the hip is extremely small, which means that you won't even need to use your irons sights 99% of the time to kill people from across the crap, or map (again, pistols can do this also). This ultimately leads to a boring, repetitive, horror show of a game, by [[Electronic Arts|EA]] of course.

Assault Rifles = Snipers

Snipers = [[Obvious|Well.. Snipers]]

Carbines = Snipers

Sub Machine-guns = Snipers, but with a super high rate of fire.

Shotguns = With slugs, Snipers

Pistols = You can snipe with these too..

Light Machine-guns = [[Fail|Total crap, them being the most inaccurate guns in the game with oddly enough the most recoil as well]].


'''The Maps'''

Another reason why this game fails is the sheer lack of maps, with only a pathetic 6 in total. Coupled with this, the maps are, as mentioned earlier, about as big as an [[asian]] man's [[Penis|dick]] and are as open [[Goatse|as...]] Most of the maps are pretty much the same, with the layout slightly changed in each one. This goes unnoticed by all of the [[Retard|hardcore MOH players]]. There is also a small amount of game modes, those being Team Assault (an attempt to make boring old team deathmatch sound cooler), Sector Control (domination from [[Call of Duty 4|CoD4]], but worse), Objective Raid ([[Fail|everyone rushes to the same spot over and over again to line up for the shooting gallery]]), and worst of all, Combat Mission. Combat Mission is only featured on 2 maps (thank god), and is like rush from [[Battlefield: Bad Company 2]], but on a scale 100 times smaller with much crappier spawns. They attempted to make it slightly different, by changing the objectives from [[Penis|M-COMS]] to something else, but this does not disguise the fact that this is the same clusterfuck [[You]] remember from [[Shit|Bad Company 2]]. A new game mode known as [[Rape|Clean Sweep]] will also be available later on as DLC (Jew). This mode is basically just search and destroy from Call of Duty in yet another tiny-ass map that [[Fag|console players]] will definitely enjoy.


'''The Score Chains'''

Score Chains in Medal of Honor are basically like killstreaks from CoD ([[Fail|again copying the game they claim to be different from]]) except that there are defensive and [[Rape|offensive]] rewards, and they can be earned by [[Shit nobody cares about|taking objectives]]. They are similar to [[Modern Warfare 2|Modern Warfare 2's]] LOLstreaks in that they are total rape and pwnage, except that they act much faster. Rewards include [[Shit|ammo, ammo, ammo,]] [[Bomb|a few different kinds of aerial strikes]], and a [[Cock|BIG-ASS CRUISE MISSILE]] (more leik jewz missile, [[No|amirite?]]).


'''The Customizations/Perks'''

You get to choose from a few different attachments and perks ([[Lie|SO REALISTICAL!]]) which are basically the same as Call of Duty's, just disguised as something else. [[Shit nobody cares about|These include the basic red dot/eotech sight]] (called holographic by [[Retard|IW]]), [[Shit nobody cares about|the sort of sniper scope thing, a suppressor, an increased zoom scope, hollow point ammo]] ([[Fail|stopping power from CoD]]), [[Shit nobody cares about|some sort of laser sight, and shotgun slugs]]. People will say MOH's perks/attachments are [[Lie|more realistic in some way, shape, or form than CoD's]], but let's be honest, they're not. [[Shit nobody cares about|No one cares..]]


'''The Spawns'''

Self-explanatory. This is, of course, on Combat Mission.

==The Campaign==

<center><youtube>7BLnDP9EkdQ</youtube></center>

{{quote|This is the best , the black ops that game really sucks is a shit black ops have the most bad grafics i see is a shit and in all call of duty they hack well if you hack is good but when you are in a match and the other player have the JTAG , shit you star scriaming and then say this game sucks aaahhh and then turn of the game but with Medal of Honor that dont gone happen. |A foreigner|}}

We basically know what's going to happen here. The [[America|Americunts]] will go in there, kill a bunch of muslims (that's about the only good part of the game), maybe lose one soldier or two, and then gtfo leaving [[Afghanistan]] in a heaping rubble. Ah, [[Awesome|America..]]


'''Story'''

The game's campaign starts off soon after the [[Old meme|9/11 attacks]] (memefags insert 9/11 joke here). It follows men who are apart of the DEVGRU operators, who all get AWESOME code names, them being Mother(fucker), Doodoo, [[Christfag|Preacher]], and [[Furry|Rabbit (possibly a furfag?)]] who also work with a sandnigger [[Arab|towelhead]] known as Tariq, who has the intelz that they need. [[Retard|Little did they know]] that Tariq was actually a sneaky bastard who had lured them into a trap. After the Americans prove that bitch wrong and kill all of his buddies, the Americans interrogate Tariq to find out that there are [[Over 9000|over 9000]] talibanz waiting up in the Shit-i-kot valley to shoot them. After this part, every other mission is just [[Shit nobody cares about|securing stuff]], [[Michael Bay|blowing stuff up]], [[VTEC Just Kicked In Yo|driving around]], [[Michael Bay|blowing more stuff up]], [[Gun|shooting people]], [[Shit|being shot at]], [[An Hero|actually suffering a bullet wound]], some on rail levels, and [[Death|dying]]. Not much of an interesting story beyond this mission. Other memorable code names include [[Cat]] (Panther), [[Las Vegas|Vegas]], [[Shit|Deuce]] (more like [[Douchebag|douche]], amirite not needed), and Dusty.

The SP and the MP work quite differently. In the campaign, the guns have ever so slightly more recoil than they do in the multiplayer. The SP also features the ability to slide as well as prone, grenade cooking, and much more guns. [[Fail|The graphics in the SP are also better than they are in MP]]. The singleplayer also features a slight bit of [[Al Gore|gore]], which is [[Fail|not seen in the multiplayer]].

In conclusion, the singleplayer is just as boring and repetitive as the multiplayer, and [[Truth|TOTALLY NOT HARDCORE]]! [[Lie|However, it is realistical]].

Also, in an attempt to actually sell this crap, the MOH 2010 Limited Edition comes with an HD remake of MOH: Frontlines which of course the [[Shit nobody cares about|PC]] does not get. 
Jew  ([[Truth|which only 1337 people haz!!!1!!1!]]) also comes with the ability to gain early access to the [[Duke Nukem Forever|Battlefield 3]] beta, which is probably the ONLY legitimate reason to buy this game (if it isn't vaporware, lulz.)  All this win, combined with the close releases of both ''Fallout: New Vegas'' and ''CoD: Black Ops'' has resulted in a mass exodus, leaving the EA MoH servers empty enough to echo.
