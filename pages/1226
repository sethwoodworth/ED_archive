On May 15th, 2008, some butthurt faggot '''([[User:El-Kaneo]])''' thought that he could get [[internets|internet]] revenge on his ex-girlfriend by [[The GRIDS that is killing ED|posting a picture of her on ED]], which is a sad combination of [[retarded]] and [[pathetic]]. A month later, '''[[User:Bunlckr]]''' discovered his new [[girlfriend|girlfriend's]] pic on ED's [[Emo|Emo page]] and decided he would flex his [[fucktard|obvious internet mastery]] and fix the situation. However, rather than simply going through the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Deletion policy|proper channels]] to get the picture removed, Asslckr decided that he would [[vandalize|take matters into his own hands]]. 


==OH NOES!!==
[[Image:El_Kaneo_schoolwtf.jpg|thumb|150px|El-Kaneo, ultimate example of a [[crybaby|cry baby]].]]
[[Image:Michael_bunlckr2.jpg|thumb|150px|Bunlckr / Asslckr / Dicklicker... all applicable.]]
First, Asslckr decided to put on his best tough guy face and vandalized [[User:El-Kaneo|El-kaneo's userpage]] with the following [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=User:El-Kaneo&oldid=1997601055 lulzy message]:

<blockquote>
<big><big>"</big></big>El-Kaneo, also known as Kane, also known as dickhead... a resident of singleton lives in greenwood avenue... [[X is not your personal army|telling you his house number would be... well least of all dangerous most of all fun...]]<br>
<br>
he seems to have a problem with me... and my [[girlfriend]]... i think thats because he thinks [[slut|she cheated on him]]<br> with me... [[lie|completely and entirely not true]] dickweed.... she left you, thats all...<br>
<br>
its certainly not reason enough to upload an image to a public website depicting her as an emo... besides being illegal... its also put a target on ur head... well dont worry buddy... i'll be paying you a visit soon enough...<br>
<br>
<big><big>[[Lulz|enroll urself in the school of hard knocks... cause i'll be instructing u soon...]]</big></big> <br>
(sic.)<big><big>"</big></big>
</blockquote>

Yeah, like anyone gives a shit about some random faggot on the internet enough to go down to this guys house.  

He then [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Emo&diff=1997601033&oldid=1997600146 deleted the pic from the emo page], not once but [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Emo&diff=1997601035&oldid=1997601034 twice].  The second time, he showed off his awesome wikiskillz, when he attempted to replace the photo by [[idiot|linking directly to his photobucket]]. ([[PROTIP]]: if you don't want people to fuck with you, then don't link to your ''public'' Photobucket album). The picture he tried to link to was the following:

{{clear}}
[[Image:Bunlckr tough guy at law.jpg|center|]]
{{clear}}

I'm sure [[internet police|Interpol]] will get right on that. Ironically, none of these things are illegal, however making [[internet tough guy|serious threats]] of physical violence on the internet ''is''.

Finally, Asslkr tried to blank the picture itself three fucking times, each time being [[cock block]]ed by ED's superior security software. At this point [[User:SecurityBot|SecurityBot]] had put up with enough of his fail, and [[B&|raeped]] him for his faggotry.

Remember kids, the internet is serious business.

==Begging for mercy==

After being booted, Bunlckr emailed [[User:WhiteMystery|WhiteMystery]] for assistance, which is what he should have done IN THE FIRST PLACE:

{{quote|hello, im sorry im a ED [[nub]] and was trying to [[Vandal|remove a picture of my girlfriend from this site]]. I'd like to be unbanned but i know that this might not happen. But i would like to request that this image is deleted http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Emo-bitch.jpg
please and thankyou. hope to be unbanned and image deleted soon.| "Michael"}}

WM took immediate action and promptly ignored him. Two days later he sent another message under the impression that [[Unrealistic expectations|he was actually going to be unbanned]] and that he had been banned a second time. Either that, or he's a fucking [[liar]].

{{quote|ok white mystery this seems to be the second time security bot has banned me. [[Liar|i'm not purposely trying to vandalise this site mate]]. im just trying to remove pictures of my girlfriend. [[BAWWW|it has offended me A LOT to see her on here]]. i just want the image removed. please. you can remove the page about me and the page about El-Kaneo if you want

i dont mind if you dont unban me but [[no|please remove the image.
please]]. you will find it on my user page because someone [[Raep|"buttraped"]] my page| [[facepalm|Face McPalm]], Private Detective.}}

After that pathetic display, it was obvious that there was only [[Troll|one reasonable course of action]].  

Most of the pictures on this page were ripped directly from his publicly open [[Photobucket]], including another picture of his girlfriend Erin (see top of page). Furthermore, this idiot was also stupid enough to [[Asking for it|leave a plethora of personal information just lying about on the internet]], as you will see below.

==Google that shit!==
[[Image:Google that shit.jpg|thumb|150px|"Google that shit!"]]
[[Image:Bunlckr iphone.jpg|thumb|150px|posting info in a public Photobucket = footbullet.]]
On his user page, Asslckr openly invites you to Google his name as he is clearly [[serious business|hot shit]].

<blockquote>
<big><big>"</big></big><nowiki>[Bunlckr]</nowiki> is the shortened form of [[Rimjob|Hypnotic Bun Licker]].<br>
Is a username used by Michael.<br>
[[Google]] searching bunlckr will return results all pertaining to me. lol.<br>

We kindly took him up on his offer:

==Update: [[User:El-Kaneo|El-Kaneo]] does not liek==
On July 28th, 2008, El Kaneo <i>finally</i> took notice of the page dedicated to his pathetic excuse for internet use. He decided, obviously [[unrealistic expectations|not learning a single lesson]] from the story on this page, that he would go [[Facepalm|face-to-face with Encyclopedia Dramatica's mighty SecurityBot]]. The results were, as expected, unsurprising:
