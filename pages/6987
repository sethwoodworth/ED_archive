'''Richard [[milhouse|Milhous]] Nixon''' a.k.a. "Tricky Dick" was the 37th president of the [[United States of America]] and the last great [[Republican]] President.  He was also the first full-blown [[batshit]] crazy to reside in the [[White House]].  According to [[DaMuffinMan]], he is also the [[Final Boss of the Internet]].  He made his name as Representative from California's 12th District.  During his tenure in the House of Representatives, as a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) he exposed State Department employee Alger Hiss as a [[Soviet]] spy.  He later became U.S. Senator from [[California]] and Vice-President of the United States under President Dwight D. "Ike" Eisenhower. Even though he was born and raised in [[California|Commiefornia]], he hated [[liberals]], [[Jews]], [[Commies]], hippies, the unemployed, counter-culture types, black persons, and [[sick fuck]]s.

Nixon is best remembered for his involvement in the break-in of the Democratic Party Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel on June 17, 1972 and its coverup.  This was probably the stupidest thing Nixon ever did, because he would have got more information about what the Democratic Party was up to by simply writing them for some brochures, since the burglars found out virtually nothing.  He also visited Red [[China]] without [[puke|vomiting]] on anyone, escalated [[Vietnam|a war]] that killed thousands for no good reason, and wiretapped everyone he knew ([[divide by zero|even himself]]) because of his increasing paranoia. Our [[Britain|British]] friends fondly remember him for taking it hard in the ass from Sir David Frost, the [[God]] of [[BBC|their brand of journalism]], live on network television.

Some years after his death, Nixon [[Jesus|rose from the dead]] and spent several years playing a minor role on ''[[Futurama]]'' before landing a role in the [[fail|epic]] movie version of ''[[Watchmen]]''.

==Nixon: Troll President==
[[Image:Phucshopped.jpg|thumb|200px|Look at that! Obviously shopped.]]

Nixon was also the biggest [[trolling IRL|IRL troll]] to ever occupy the White House. The following is a list of [[epic]] [[troll]]s that Nixon was involved in:

* Pwning Laos and [[Cambodia]] by conducting a secret [[genocide|bombing]] campaign against them that everyone knew about.  Nixon denied his involvement in the bombing of Laos and Cambodia to his death, even though he admitted to just about every other naughty thing he did.

* Almost nuking [[Vietnam]] so he could watch them freak the fuck out.

* Trolling [[Ohio|Kent State]] by having the [[Military|National Guard]] shoot their [[hippies|students]].

* [[Dick Cheney|Had a bunch of heart attacks and strokes but somehow survived them all]].  It is rumored that he and [[Dick Cheney]] secretly developed a cure for heart attacks which has not yet been revealed to the general public.

* Believed that the famous picture of [[azn|Kim Phuc]] running down the street after her village had been napalmed was [[This looks shopped|shopped]]. He could tell from some of the pixels and [[irony|from seeing quite a few shops in his time]].

* Trolled Democrats by hiring a bunch of people with weird names to [[rape|penetrate]] the Democratic headquarters in DC to get [[n00dz|secritz]].

* Got so [[RAGE|pissed]] at [[mormon|a muck-racker reporter]] [[East_High_School_Salt_Lake_City|columnist Jack Anderson]] for uncovering his shit right and left, Nixon ordered his lackeys to [[die|make him 'disappear']] Nixon's aides "acted on his behalf" and tried to have him [[murder|assassinated]]. 

Nixon definitely knew that [[JEWS DID WTC|Jews were capable of doing WTC]] but he still hired several [[Jews|of them]] to work in his administration, including [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[unfunny|Ben Stein]]. It can only be concluded that [[I did it for the lulz|he did it for the lulz]].

==Watergate==
[[Image:Watergate1lg.jpg|thumb|[[I See What You Did There|A visual representation]].]]
On 17 June 1972, Nixon hired some Mexicans and Jews to rob the Democratic Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in [[Washington, DC]]. His first mistake was assuming that a Democrat would own anything of value. His second was hiring Jews to do a nigga job. When the henchmen were spotted lurking into the hotel wearing recon armor and "We Heart [[Dick]]" buttons, they were detained and questioned. Being the experts of deceit they were, they claimed they had only done it for the free peanuts promised to them by an unknown [[transvestite]] they met in the lobby. The scandal would have blown over, had not famous [[porn]] star Linda Lovelace called Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and handed over an incriminating series of tapes on which Nixon can clearly be heard ordering the imprisonment of anyone known to have snickered at his middle name.

Once the liberal media got a hold of this news, no zone was free of spin. Nixon cried to [[Henry Kissinger]], who took his moneys and told him to go into hiding. [[In the ass|In the end]], he decided to resign the presidency, effective at noon [[Last thursday|tomorrow]]. He was pried from The Oval Office with an iron stick of liberal +10 summoning (now owned and masturbated with by [[Keith Olbermann]]) and dumped on the [[George W Bush|White House]] lawn with orders never to return.

===The Tapes===
Nixon loved wiretapping people so much, he put recording devices throughout the White House and [[irony|tapped his own phone lines]] so he could remember [[bribery|everything he talked about]]. When the tapes of intimate private discussions between Nixon and his chief advisers were made public, people were fascinated by the [[drama]] and [[lulz]]. Never before had average [[American]] citizens been privy to the inner workings of government. 

====Nixon and The Jews====
'''Nixon:''' Well, listen, are they all [[Jews]] over there?<br>
'''Colson:''' Every one of them. Well, a couple of exceptions.<br>
'''Nixon:''' See my point? You know goddamn well they’re out to kill us.

====Nixon, Drugs...and The Jews====
'''Nixon:''' Now, this is one thing I want. I want a Goddamn strong statement on [[drugs|marijuana]]. Can I get that out of this [[wut|sonofabitching]], uh, Domestic Council?
<br>'''Haldeman:''' Sure.
<br>'''Nixon:''' I mean one on marijuana that just [[gore|tears the ass out of them]]. I see another thing in the news summary this morning about it. You know it's a funny thing, every one of the bastards that are out for legalizing marijuana is [[Jewish]]. What the Christ is the matter with the Jews, Bob, [[everything|what is the matter with them?]] I suppose it's because most of them are psychiatrists, you know, there's so many, all the greatest psychiatrists are Jewish. By God we are going to hit the marijuana thing, and I want to hit it right square in the [[pussy|puss]].

====Nixon on How The Jews are Total Cowards====
'''Nixon:''' I didn’t notice many Jewish names coming back from [[Vietnam]] on any of those lists; I don’t know how the hell they avoid it...if you look at the Canadian-Swedish contingent, they were very disproportionately Jewish. The deserters.

====Nixon on Everybody, But Mostly The Jews====
'''Nixon:''' The Jews have certain traits...the Irish have certain — for example, the [[Never drinking again|Irish can’t drink]]. What you always have to remember with the Irish is they get [[Northern Ireland|mean]]. Virtually every Irish I’ve known gets mean when he drinks. Particularly the real Irish... the Italians, of course, those people course [[Jersey Shore|don’t have their heads screwed on tight]]. They are [[Lies|wonderful people]], but...the Jews are just a very aggressive and abrasive and obnoxious personality.

===Nixon on [[Abortion]]===
{{Quote|There are times when an abortion is [[Falcon Punch|necessary]]. I know that. When you have a black and a white, or a [[rape]]|Richard Nixon showing why he was elected president.}}

====The Missing Tape====
According to [[BBC|David Frost]] and his [[Britain|cohorts]], Richard Nixon deleted 18 minutes of tape in which he laid down the foundation for the WTC attack plans, told his aides who shot JFK, explained in great detail the UFOs being kept at Area 51 in [[New Mexico]], had a viewing of the behind the scenes footage of the first lunar landing in 1969 and reviewed aloud the ingredients of the brain control supplements the government puts into the tap water.

==The Death of Nixon==
After being ejected from the White House like shit from your asshole the night after you ate Thai food, Nixon packed up his [[woman|wife]] and rode his golf cart back to his Spanish villa on the Pacific Ocean in California, where he spent the next several years praying, crying, being interviewed by David Frost and planning his eventual and triumphant return. His bitches were sent to court and questioned by the [[circle jerk|Senate]] until they all eventually [[suicide|self-pwned]] or went missing. In an act of [[bribery|kindness]] to his predecessor, President [[fail|Gerald]] [[Aspie|Ford]] gave Mr. Nixon a "full and complete pardon," meaning Nixon could nevar evar be put on trial for any alleged wrongdoing. He died in 1994 and was buried in secret so his grave could not be defiled. His last words were "[[Henry Kissinger|Where the fuck is Kissinger!?]]"

==Hunter S. Thompson's Eulogy of Richard M. Nixon==

From Rolling Stone, June 16, 1994


HE WAS A CROOK
by Hunter S. Thompson


MEMO FROM THE NATIONAL AFFAIRS DESK DATE: MAY 1, 1994 FROM: DR. HUNTER S. THOMPSON SUBJECT: THE DEATH OF RICHARD NIXON: NOTES ON THE PASSING OF AN AMERICAN MONSTER.... HE WAS A LIAR AND A QUITTER, AND HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BURIED AT SEA.... BUT HE WAS, AFTER ALL, THE PRESIDENT. 
"And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird."

---Revelation 18:2 

Richard Nixon is gone now, and I am poorer for it. He was the real thing -- a political monster straight out of Grendel and a very dangerous enemy. He could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time. He lied to his friends and betrayed the trust of his family. Not even Gerald Ford, the unhappy ex-president who pardoned Nixon and kept him out of prison, was immune to the evil fallout. Ford, who believes strongly in Heaven and Hell, has told more than one of his celebrity golf partners that "I know I will go to hell, because I pardoned Richard Nixon."  

I have had my own bloody relationship with Nixon for many years, but I am not worried about it landing me in hell with him. I have already been there with that bastard, and I am a better person for it. Nixon had the unique ability to make his enemies seem honorable, and we developed a keen sense of fraternity. Some of my best friends have hated Nixon all their lives. My mother hates Nixon, my son hates Nixon, I hate Nixon, and this hatred has brought us together.

Nixon laughed when I told him this. "Don't worry," he said, "I, too, am a family man, and we feel the same way about you."

It was Richard Nixon who got me into politics, and now that he's gone, I feel lonely. He was a giant in his way. As long as Nixon was politically alive -- and he was, all the way to the end -- we could always be sure of finding the enemy on the Low Road. There was no need to look anywhere else for the evil bastard. He had the fighting instincts of a badger trapped by hounds. The badger will roll over on its back and emit a smell of death, which confuses the dogs and lures them in for the traditional ripping and tearing action. But it is usually the badger who does the ripping and tearing. It is a beast that fights best on its back: rolling under the throat of the enemy and seizing it by the head with all four claws.

That was Nixon's style -- and if you forgot, he would kill you as a lesson to the others. Badgers don't fight fair, bubba. That's why God made dachshunds.

Nixon was a navy man, and he should have been buried at sea. Many of his friends were seagoing people: Bebe Rebozo, Robert Vesco, William F. Buckley Jr., and some of them wanted a full naval burial.

These come in at least two styles, however, and Nixon's immediate family strongly opposed both of them. In the traditionalist style, the dead president's body would be wrapped and sewn loosely in canvas sailcloth and dumped off the stern of a frigate at least 100 miles off the coast and at least 1,000 miles south of San Diego, so the corpse could never wash up on American soil in any recognizable form.

The family opted for cremation until they were advised of the potentially onerous implications of a strictly private, unwitnessed burning of the body of the man who was, after all, the President of the United States. Awkward questions might be raised, dark allusions to Hitler and Rasputin. People would be filing lawsuits to get their hands on the dental charts. Long court battles would be inevitable -- some with liberal cranks bitching about corpus delicti and habeas corpus and others with giant insurance companies trying not to pay off on his death benefits. Either way, an orgy of greed and duplicity was sure to follow any public hint that Nixon might have somehow faked his own death or been cryogenically transferred to fascist Chinese interests on the Central Asian Mainland.

It would also play into the hands of those millions of self-stigmatized patriots like me who believe these things already.

If the right people had been in charge of Nixon's funeral, his casket would have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. Nixon was so crooked that he needed servants to help him screw his pants on every morning. Even his funeral was illegal. He was queer in the deepest way. His body should have been burned in a trash bin.

These are harsh words for a man only recently canonized by President Clinton and my old friend George McGovern -- but I have written worse things about Nixon, many times, and the record will show that I kicked him repeatedly long before he went down. I beat him like a mad dog with mange every time I got a chance, and I am proud of it. He was scum. 

Let there be no mistake in the history books about that. Richard Nixon was an evil man -- evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it. He was utterly without ethics or morals or any bedrock sense of decency. Nobody trusted him -- except maybe the Stalinist Chinese, and honest historians will remember him mainly as a rat who kept scrambling to get back on the ship.

It is fitting that Richard Nixon's final gesture to the American people was a clearly illegal series of 21 105-mm howitzer blasts that shattered the peace of a residential neighborhood and permanently disturbed many children. Neighbors also complained about another unsanctioned burial in the yard at the old Nixon place, which was brazenly illegal. "It makes the whole neighborhood like a graveyard," said one. "And it fucks up my children's sense of values."

Many were incensed about the howitzers -- but they knew there was nothing they could do about it -- not with the current president sitting about 50 yards away and laughing at the roar of the cannons. It was Nixon's last war, and he won.

The funeral was a dreary affair, finely staged for TV and shrewdly dominated by ambitious politicians and revisionist historians. The Rev. Billy Graham, still agile and eloquent at the age of 136, was billed as the main speaker, but he was quickly upstaged by two 1996 GOP presidential candidates: Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who formally hosted the event and saw his poll numbers crippled when he got blown off the stage by Dole, who somehow seized the No. 3 slot on the roster and uttered such a shameless, self-serving eulogy that even he burst into tears at the end of it.

Dole's stock went up like a rocket and cast him as the early GOP front-runner for '96. Wilson, speaking next, sounded like an Engelbert Humperdinck impersonator and probably won't even be re-elected as governor of California in November.

The historians were strongly represented by the No. 2 speaker, Henry Kissinger, Nixon's secretary of state and himself a zealous revisionist with many axes to grind. He set the tone for the day with a maudlin and spectacularly self-serving portrait of Nixon as even more saintly than his mother and as a president of many godlike accomplishments -- most of them put together in secret by Kissinger, who came to California as part of a huge publicity tour for his new book on diplomacy, genius, Stalin, H. P. Lovecraft and other great minds of our time, including himself and Richard Nixon.

Kissinger was only one of the many historians who suddenly came to see Nixon as more than the sum of his many squalid parts. He seemed to be saying that History will not have to absolve Nixon, because he has already done it himself in a massive act of will and crazed arrogance that already ranks him supreme, along with other Nietzschean supermen like Hitler, Jesus, Bismarck and the Emperor Hirohito. These revisionists have catapulted Nixon to the status of an American Caesar, claiming that when the definitive history of the 20th century is written, no other president will come close to Nixon in stature. "He will dwarf FDR and Truman," according to one scholar from Duke University.

It was all gibberish, of course. Nixon was no more a Saint than he was a Great President. He was more like Sammy Glick than Winston Churchill. He was a cheap crook and a merciless war criminal who bombed more people to death in Laos and Cambodia than the U.S. Army lost in all of World War II, and he denied it to the day of his death. When students at Kent State University, in Ohio, protested the bombing, he connived to have them attacked and slain by troops from the National Guard.

Some people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for Objective Journalism -- which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition was often painful.

Nixon's meteoric rise from the unemployment line to the vice presidency in six quick years would never have happened if TV had come along 10 years earlier. He got away with his sleazy "my dog Checkers" speech in 1952 because most voters heard it on the radio or read about it in the headlines of their local, Republican newspapers. When Nixon finally had to face the TV cameras for real in the 1960 presidential campaign debates, he got whipped like a red-headed mule. Even die-hard Republican voters were shocked by his cruel and incompetent persona. Interestingly, most people who heard those debates on the radio thought Nixon had won. But the mushrooming TV audience saw him as a truthless used-car salesman, and they voted accordingly. It was the first time in 14 years that Nixon lost an election.

When he arrived in the White House as VP at the age of 40, he was a smart young man on the rise -- a hubris-crazed monster from the bowels of the American dream with a heart full of hate and an overweening lust to be President. He had won every office he'd run for and stomped like a Nazi on all of his enemies and even some of his friends.

Nixon had no friends except George Will and J. Edgar Hoover (and they both deserted him). It was Hoover's shameless death in 1972 that led directly to Nixon's downfall. He felt helpless and alone with Hoover gone. He no longer had access to either the Director or the Director's ghastly bank of Personal Files on almost everybody in Washington.

Hoover was Nixon's right flank, and when he croaked, Nixon knew how Lee felt when Stonewall Jackson got killed at Chancellorsville. It permanently exposed Lee's flank and led to the disaster at Gettysburg.

For Nixon, the loss of Hoover led inevitably to the disaster of Watergate. It meant hiring a New Director -- who turned out to be an unfortunate toady named L. Patrick Gray, who squealed like a pig in hot oil the first time Nixon leaned on him. Gray panicked and fingered White House Counsel John Dean, who refused to take the rap and rolled over, instead, on Nixon, who was trapped like a rat by Dean's relentless, vengeful testimony and went all to pieces right in front of our eyes on TV.

That is Watergate, in a nut, for people with seriously diminished attention spans. The real story is a lot longer and reads like a textbook on human treachery. They were all scum, but only Nixon walked free and lived to clear his name. Or at least that's what Bill Clinton says -- and he is, after all, the President of the United States.

Nixon liked to remind people of that. He believed it, and that was why he went down. He was not only a crook but a fool. Two years after he quit, he told a TV journalist that "if the president does it, it can't be illegal."

Shit. Not even Spiro Agnew was that dumb. He was a flat-out, knee-crawling thug with the morals of a weasel on speed. But he was Nixon's vice president for five years, and he only resigned when he was caught red-handed taking cash bribes across his desk in the White House.

Unlike Nixon, Agnew didn't argue. He quit his job and fled in the night to Baltimore, where he appeared the next morning in U.S. District Court, which allowed him to stay out of prison for bribery and extortion in exchange for a guilty (no contest) plea on income-tax evasion. After that he became a major celebrity and played golf and tried to get a Coors distributorship. He never spoke to Nixon again and was an unwelcome guest at the funeral. They called him Rude, but he went anyway. It was one of those Biological Imperatives, like salmon swimming up waterfalls to spawn before they die. He knew he was scum, but it didn't bother him.

Agnew was the Joey Buttafuoco of the Nixon administration, and Hoover was its Caligula. They were brutal, brain-damaged degenerates worse than any hit man out of The Godfather, yet they were the men Richard Nixon trusted most. Together they defined his Presidency.

It would be easy to forget and forgive Henry Kissinger of his crimes, just as he forgave Nixon. Yes, we could do that -- but it would be wrong. Kissinger is a slippery little devil, a world-class hustler with a thick German accent and a very keen eye for weak spots at the top of the power structure. Nixon was one of those, and Super K exploited him mercilessly, all the way to the end.

Kissinger made the Gang of Four complete: Agnew, Hoover, Kissinger and Nixon. A group photo of these perverts would say all we need to know about the Age of Nixon.

Nixon's spirit will be with us for the rest of our lives -- whether you're me or Bill Clinton or you or Kurt Cobain or Bishop Tutu or Keith Richards or Amy Fisher or Boris Yeltsin's daughter or your fiancee's 16-year-old beer-drunk brother with his braided goatee and his whole life like a thundercloud out in front of him. This is not a generational thing. You don't even have to know who Richard Nixon was to be a victim of his ugly, Nazi spirit.

He has poisoned our water forever. Nixon will be remembered as a classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest. But he also shit in our nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory like a brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.

tl;dr Faggot died lol
