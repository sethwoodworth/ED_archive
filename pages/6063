Opinion
[[File:Opinionpauly.JPG|thumb|right|PaulStrealer is wrong, and needs to stfu]]
An '''Opinion''' is a fictional concept used by [[pussies|individuals who hate confrontation]] or [[internet tough guys|people who can’t stand being told they are wrong.]]  The truth is that everything you say is [[Doing it wrong|right]] and people who can’t handle the reality of their own [[aspie|idiocy]] label it as an opinion so that they can pretend that it may not be true.  The proper response to being told that what is, in fact, [[truth]] is just your opinion is one of the many variants of [[ALL CAPS|STFU YOU FUCKING RETARD HIPPIE]].


==Origin==
Opinions were invented by [[hippies]] when they were spawned in the 1960s.  Unlike other species of [[shit|humans]], the [[hippies]] couldn’t handle realizing the flaws in their [[dream|ideology.]]  They sought to end corruption in politics and war by doing lots of [[drugs]] and listening to shitty improvised [[music]].  Since the hippies were part of a reproductive boom for the people of URTH, they all grew up to be democrats and had a shitload of [[loli|babies]] just in time for the [[internet]].  Now there are millions upon millions of [[retards]] parading around cyberspace saying whatever they want and becoming [[butthurt]] whenever they are told in what way they are completely and utterly fucking [[stupid]].

==Types of Opinions==
Opinions, like technology, [[atheists]], and [[AIDS]], have evolved into several subspecies.  Each inherently idiotic due to its roots, yet different enough to warrant explanation.  Understanding the various types of opinions is necessary if one hopes to [[pwn]] [[newfags]] rather than become one themself.

===Humble Opinion===

{{天|'''PRO TIP:''' Do not have a humble opinion unless you are about to say some seriously insulting shit afterwards or else you '''WILL''' look like a [[Cock goes where?|pussy]]|Protipwagon.jpg}}

A '''Humble Opinion''' is used to describe something said by [[The Blue Waffle|a pussy of disturbing proportions.]]  Before saying something that might make another hippie-spawn [[butthurt]] they will insert '''In My Humble Opinion''' followed by either a flaw in someone they are afraid of or a record-settingly stupid theory.  This is a tactic used to preserve their [[ego]] so that when the subject begins to [[rage]] at them, they can say that it is just their opinion and therefore [[fictional]].


If the user of the humble opinion is a bad-ass it will be followed by [[flaming]] and [[samefag|insults]].

Example: '''In our humble opinion, anyone reading an ED article on opinions is a fucking loser who can't back up what he says.'''

===Entitled Opinion===
An '''Entitled Opinion''' is born from situations where the number of people saying shit that isn’t true far outweighs [[fact|what you are saying]].  Feelings are hurt, and [[girl|someone who is trying to avoid broken ideologies]] interjects with that famous phrase that usually only makes things even more [[lulzy]]:
{{Quote|Everyone is entitled to their own opinion|Someone trying to follow in the footsteps of their retard [[hippie]] parents}}
This denotes that even if the people you are attempting to educate are denying that [[JEWS DID WTC|the jews were behind September 11th]] you have to let them remain in their [[bullshit|ignorant bliss]].  This person, who is usually a [[lolcow]], believes in peaceful and free coexistence.  They are willing to enforce this [[fiction|opinion]] with an iron fist, [[irony|ironically.]]

===Your Opinion, Man===
[[File:FLR_lern2bedismissive.jpg|thumb|right|Clearly in denial]]
Unlike most other instances of opinion, '''"That’s just, like, your opinion, man."''' has become a manifestation of opinion [[IRL]] and is usually not encountered on the internet unless on an [[Big Lebowski|independent movie]] loving [[community]].  When encountered IRL, it’s a common phrase used by a [[hippie]] ([[No|surprised?]]) who considers themselves to be on friendly terms with you, which they obviously are not.  You will encounter this phrase when you tell them something on a personal level to fuck with their view of the world, and they directly tell you that they’d rather ignore the [[truth]].  The “man” is added as in hopes you will [[Do not want|view them as friendly and try to coexist]].  The answer to this, if you have learned anything you should know the proper response from reading the first paragraph of [[Self aware|this article]].
