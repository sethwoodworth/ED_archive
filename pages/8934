Weathercat
[[Image:Wettercat.jpg|thumb|right|Verdammt klar, Wetterkatze]]'''Weathercat''' ([[Nazi|German]]: ''Wetterkatze''; real name ''Lupin'') is a [[Nazi|German]] cat whose mission is to assist meteorologists with television weather forecasting. The feline forecaster became an [[internet]]s phenom on 8 January 2009 when Reuters broke the story of Weathercat on its online news feed.

{{squote|<b>A cat wandered onto the set of a live weather forecast by Germany's leading [non-credentialed Swiss] meteorologist JÃ¶rg Kachelmann and waved its tail in front of the camera as it rubbed up against his leg.

Kachelmann had just started his two-minute forecast after the news on Tuesday when the cat appeared. Without missing a beat, he scooped Lupin up and finished his forecast while the cat pointed a paw at the weather map.

'I don't know how he got into the studio,' Kachelmann told Reuters, adding Lupin belonged to a staffer who was out of town.

'I noticed him when he rubbed against my leg and thought people might wonder what was happening. I figured it would be easier to control the cat by picking him up. Cats get annoyed if they feel ignored. So I made sure he didn't feel ignored.'</b>|}}

The video of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP4zaMvV__4 Weathercat's TV debut] has become one of the most widely disseminated online items since [[goatse]], bringing goofy, baby-like grins to the faces of everyone from [[homosexual|hardened Marine drill instructors]] to [[cult|custard-brained high school guidance counselors]].
