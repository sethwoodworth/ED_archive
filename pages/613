'''Arkansas''' is a small state northeast of [[Texas]]. Most Arkansans are descended from a band of [[fucktards|Neanderthals]] that floated to North America from Europe on a log bundle [[Over 9000|over 9,000]] years ago, and survived in isolation among Native American peoples before reuniting with other [[white people]] [[at least 100 years ago]].

As part of the Louisiana Purchase, a large number of stupid, hairy Frenchmen bred with the recent neanderthals before it became part of the United States. Although this arguably increased their intelligence beyond neanderthals, they don't want to act like they are anything more than [[retarded]].

The legal pronunciation of Arkansas (Ark-en-saw) is a mongolation caused by the Frenchmen in Arkansas. The French Americans preferred the way it would be pronounced by a Frenchie, and since the state was part of the Louisiana Purchase, no one cared to argue. While ugly people would have preferred to pronounce the state ar-kan-sas, now the accepted form is ark-en-saw. This is one of the earliest examples of trolling in the United States government. However, most other place names in the state have been Americanized, rendering Arkansas non self-consistent and liable to suffer spontaneous existence failure at any moment. States other than [[Mississippi]] are praying for this day since it will raise the average education level of the U.S.

Until recently, Arkansas had the second lowest number of bachelor degrees per capita, second only to Mississippi. This means that it is near impossible to find a girl to have an intelligent conversation with, but makes them easier to fuck.

Arkansas has developed a little-known dialect of its own. In Arkansas, the name for someone who is single and over the age of 20 is "divorcee." The name for someone over the age of 16 is "mother" if female or "father" if male.

Arkansans are a hearty race, accustomed to surviving off a diet of hog fat and common weeds.  A favorite pastime amongst Arkansan men is displaying their [[cock|"dong"]] to [[women|womenfolk]]. Arkansan women, for their part, amuse onlookers by slinging a [[tit]] over one shoulder and squirting milk behind their back. Arkansans are unique among [[southerners]] for retaining [[Democrat|Democratic]] tendencies in sizable numbers; which betrays the unusual divergence of the DNA from their more uniformly [[Republican]] neighbors.
