'''[http://blue-six.deviantart.com Blue-Six]''' from deviantART, is a 21 year old black person living somewhere in California named Isaiah. Nobody is quite sure how to pronounce the train wreck of letters that is his given name, but everyone pretends they do since they assume it is his slave name. Isaiah, hereafter referred to as "Nig Noggy", spends at least 8 hours of his day in the deviantART chatrooms, where he socializes by role playing a fantasy land in which he is a 15 year old Japanese school girl. However, to outside observers, his bizarre rituals simply make him appear to be some sort of anime-obsessed [[faggot]]. 

Nig Noggy appears to have little or no personality. The bulk of his messages comprise of smilies such as the big grin or giggling. Even when he was dumped by his white girlfriend (an ugly dyke-looking white girl by the name of "yashachan" - probably some other [[anime]] obsessed freak) all he managed was a consecutive series of :D and XD emotes. Nig Noggy is perhaps the best evidence yet that black people have no souls. 

==Nig Noggy's Poems: An Exercise in Distilling Faggotry==

''why do humans try to measure the non-tangible?<br>
''i love her "this" much<br>
''she wants "that" much of my heart<br>
''he needs "all" of my mind<br>
''pieces that don't fit, mashed together<br> 
''a hodgepodge of emotions and duty.<br>
''the cicada breaks me from these thoughts,<br>
''a reprive gladly taken -<br>
''but I can't help but wonder;<br>
''how much is too much?<br>
''what is enough?''<br>

Clearly, Nig Noggy has mastered the art of shitty emo poetry, and he [[Ebonics|can't spell]] for a buck, either. He may also be one of the reason so many people hate [[niggers]].
