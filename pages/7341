Secret policy document
{{elaw}}
[[Image:AngryBook.jpg|thumb|left|The LJ ToS is kept in a secret book bound in human skin known as the NecroTOSicon]]
The policies and procedures document intended to guide [[LJ Abuse]] [[fanboy|team members]] in enforcing the [[LJ TOS]]. This is [[Internet Law]]'s equivalent of the [[fail|Patriot Act]].

This document was leaked to certain non-Danga employees and then posted on various sites around the [[Internets]], which created huge [[drama]].
