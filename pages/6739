{{lj|qweerdo}} is a member of <span class="ljcommlink">'''[[brutal_honesty]]'''</span> and a noted [[fag]]. However, unlike your average cute and loveable fag, Qweerdo has [[AIDS|HIV]] [[IRL]]. No, srsly. And the best part? He [[fuck]]ed guys [[in_the_ass|constantly]] after finding out he was HIV+, and he didn't tell them, which makes him essentially a [[serial killer]].


"I did meth for 20 years.
The meth made me hyper-sexual.
About 10-15 years ago I tested positive for HIV. (It's not that I don't know almost exactly when I got it. I just can't remember how long it's been.)
After finding out about the HIV, I continued having anonymous sex without telling people. I was safer, sometimes.
I'd love to be able to blame it all on the drugs but that's just not possible. I knew what I was doing.
Now, nobody "gave" me HIV. I went out and got it. I knew what I was doing then, as well. I wasn't trying to get it but I knew it was a very real possibility with what I was doing.

I don't know what else to say. I'm sorry I did it but there is absolutely nothing I can do about that now."


Qweerdo was also a [[meth]] addict for [[At least 100|at least 100]] years. Since he quit doing meth, and therefore hanging around with [[fag|people who do meth]], he has not gotten laid once. Considering these pictures, that's not surprising. He does, however, attempt to [[rape|proposition]] every male in brutal_honesty. Everyone secretly hopes that {{lj|korean_guy_01}} will someday come out of the closet and agree, because every member of brutal_honesty wants Korean Guy to die of [[AIDS]].
