Sniffer

'''Sniffer''' is a [[meme]] used en masse by [[4chan|/b/tards]] when referring to an extremely lethal and dangerous object in possession of anybody who knows their [[Computer Science III]].

[[Lulz]] ensued on [[Shit nobody cares about|April 24th, 2010]] when apparently, a [[16 year old girl]] provided [[fap]]-worthy material to her boyfriend, whose [[Facebook]] account was then [[Hacker|haxed]] by a [[newfag]] acquaintance by the charming name of [[Faggot|Chris Rowland]] and proceeded to post [[dox]] and [[Image|pics]], resulting in further lulz. While the [[HACKERS_ON_STEROIDS|hacker]] in question is probably getting [[Ass Rape|ass raped]] by the [[Party Van|FBI]], 4chan is erupting amid laughter over the stupidity of these three (now two?) virgins.
