BitTorrent
{{WP80sm}}
'''Bittorent''' is a peer-to-peer [[porn]] file sharing protocol used by [[Basement Dweller|basement dwelling]] [[Technical virgin|virgins]] to download massive amounts of [[Furry|furfuckery and yiffporn]].  It is probably the most common protocol for transferring the insanely large folders of [[yaoi]] back and forth over the internet.  Other common files that are transferred over the bittorrent protocol include [[hentai]], tentacle rape porn, [[Acrotomophilia|amputee porn]], [[Pedophilia|pedoporn]], dutch porn, and [[Snuff|snuff porn]].  It is estimated that [[Statistics|over 35%]] of the internet’s traffic is found on the bittorrent protocol. It will [[rape]] your [[internet]] connection so good your [[ISP]] will probably [[cock block]] you, and yet the software downloads shit at less than 1 kB/s on a [[Never|good day]].

== '''History''' ==

Bittorrent was created in 2001 by programmer [[Bram Cohen]] who kept this [[magic]] under wraps for two months.  Finally, after realizing that he would need [[Moar|more]] [[ppl|people]] using the protocol so that he could download his [[warez]], [[loli]], and [[MP3|illegally shared music files]] faster, he uncorked this genie from it's bottle and the internet has not been the same since.

== '''How Bittorrent Works''' ==

The initial owner of a porn file will make what is called a torrent.  He then uses this torrent to [[Seed Plz|seed]] his [[Sick Fuck|perversity]] to other [[Fag|perverts]]  around the world.   Each pervert who downloads the initial seed also uploads the pornographic data at the same time, this leads to a very fast and efficient way to distribute your [[Wapanese|Japanese]] [[Roman Shower|vomit porn]] to all of your [[friends]].  As each downloader completes the initial seed, they also begin seeding the files.  This exponentially increases the downloading speed for the rest of the [[Pervert|depraved old men]] who are looking for pictures or videos of your little [[Incest|sister]] dancing with a [[poop.mov|Sharpie]] [[In the ass|in her ass]] in front of her [[Camwhore|webcam]].  The more seeds there are, the faster you get to [[Fap|beat off]]. 

Don't get demotivated after downloading an antivirus and realizing it has a virus after infecting your pc beacuse you couln't scan the antivirus setup because u didn't have an antvirus and u were already attempting to have one and u infected your pc because u didnt have an antivirus when ure looking for one.

== '''Bittorrent Clients''' ==

There are [[Over 9000|approximately eleven-billion]] Bittorrent clients available.  Here is a brief list of popular clients:

== How to properly create a torrent ==

* If video content, edit in a title-credit at the beginning, something like "RiPpEd bY z3r0c00l" with some nickelback playing over some CG fire in the background. Alternatively place a high-contrast watermark in one of the corners throughout the feature (bonus points if it's animated!)
* If a DVD-R image, make sure it's [[shit|PAL fullscreen]] and that you don't mention that in the description. Also take out all the extras and commentary, since people only download DVD-R images because they want a 4GB mpeg with a menu.
*Include a couple text and .nfo files that contain information on where to find you and your friends on [[IRC]].
* [[RAR]] everything into a 100-file split archive. Everyone will be on broadband but you're actually doing everyone a favor by shaving off those 2 megabytes. If you are [[scene]] this is mandatory. You're [[important]], so your releases should require twice the needed space on their drives; the rars for seeding and the unrar'd content for its use.
* Password that fucker and have a long list of things people have to do to get the password (most likely clicking your ads somewhere). Why should they get '''''your''''' shit for free?
* Attach your [[username|hacker alias]] to the resulting torrent's filename, because ripping shit is only getting harder, and people need to know who rules the school ([[truth|you do]]).

== Video Quality Designation ==
* If shot with a camera from a seat in the theater, it is TS.
* If shot from the projection booth with a high quality camera and later synced with a direct audio source then it is a DVDSCR.
* If it is a rip from a DVD meant to go to the [[Jews|academy]] (watermarked, other video irregularities) then it is a DVDRIP
* If it was ripped from a commercial DVD meant for consumers then it has no designation and your description shouldn't include screenshots.

=='''Opponents of Bittorrent'''==

[[Image:Download a car.jpg|thumb|175px|left|fuck, i might even download a truck - [[Killhamster]]]]
[[Image:Torrent a car.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Check out the sweet rides I downloaded.]]
[[Image:Bt3.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Even dead guys can torrent.]]
Anybody smart enough to get out of the [[HTML|http and ftp]] league will, with any luck, make Bittorrent [[No girls on the internet|his]] preferred way of attaining pr0n. Luckily, it doesn't take much [[brain|brains]], and due to frequent [[copyright]] crackdowns Bittorrent is a [[Drama Llama|drama generator]] like no other. If it gets shut down the world would witness a drama explosion of such [[epic]] magnitude and proportion that [[Russia|Chernobyl]] would look like a urinal [[cake]] in comparison.

In most countries, it is highly illegal to distribute copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright holder. Because of the potential for people to [[steal|try]] [[music]] albums or watch movies prior to purchasing them, copyright holders hate Bittorrent.  Because of Bittorrent, users are now capable of sifting through the 99% [[crap]] that copyright holders dish out on the unsuspecting public, and actually enjoy what they watch or listen to.

Many opponents of the Bittorrent protocol like to use the argument that "You wouldn't download a car" as an example of [[Moralfag|why a person should not use a Bittorrent client to download illegal files]].  This argument is rather silly though, considering the fact that if you actually used the Bittorrent protocol to download a car, you could quite possibly end up dead or severely injured due to an automobile flying out of your router. Also, if it were possible, yes, yes [[you]] would.

=== '''HTTP Competition''' ===
BitTorrent is slow, time-consuming and insecure. Even if you use a private tracker (Demonoid is not a private tracker dipshit). In the other hand, HTTP, which was invented 7 years prior to BitTorrent, offers a higher speed download and upload via SSL Protocol (makes you immune, really). But it requires money. Money requires income. Income requires job. Job requires skill. Skill... We'll leave it at that.

=='''Trackers'''==

[[Image:DavveywolfBZ.jpg‎ |thumb|250px|right| A typical Private Tracker: a mashup of [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|EGO and PARANOIA]] (eg Davveywolf of TheBox.bz)]]
Just what is a torrent tracker?  A Bittorrent tracker is a main [[server]] which assists you in downloading all the [[CP]] and [[Matt Sanchez|Dirty Sanchez]] porn you could ever imagine. A tracker will serve your [[IP]] to [[random]] people who want to [[fap]] to the same porn that you do. Be careful, [[Mike Sandy]] can get a hold of your [[IP]]. The owners of such Tracker servers feel it necessary to remind you that downloading copyright software, movies, music, and porn is an [[Internet Law|illegal offense]], and that they do not actually have any of those files on the server.  

If you use public trackers you will get in [[jail]] where [[Bubba]] will give you [[extreme]] [[rape]] for your ghastly crimes against welfare of multi-billionaire "[[sellout|artist]]s" like Snoop Dogg.

A private tracker is a tracker that only [[snob]]s can use.  They are generally restricted by passwords and the [[Virgin|users]] are carefully watched to ensure that they are breaking the law just as much as everybody else is. Private trackers usually require an invite code to join which can only be obtained by from a [[Nerd|Member]] of said private tracker site. Occasionally some private tracker sites might "open" up for a weekend or so where people can join without needing an invite code. 

[[Last Thursday]] it was determined by the courts that it is illegal to profit from private tracker sites so instead private sites rely heavily on donations from its members to stay on teh [[interwebz]]. Donations are also one way of obtaining invite codes that you can give to <s>all your friends</s>random strangers you meet on the internets. You also can get upload credit added to your ratio, a small jew gold star next to your name which will grow your [[e-penis]].

=='''What Is Bittorrent To You?'''==

Bittorrent is a lot of things to a lot of people.  The [[P2P|protocol]] has opened up the internet to millions of users.  It allows the [[You|average nerd]] to see things that were [[Censorship|previously held unseeable]] at a faster rate than ever before.  Here are some random thoughts on what the Bittorrent protocol means to the [[typical|average]] [[luser|user]]:
