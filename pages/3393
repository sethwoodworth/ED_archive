[[Image:GokuvsSuperman4.jpg|thumb|right|Five seconds later, they started fucking.]]

Since the beginning of the [[internets]], [[basement dwellers|man]] has wondered who would win in an [[epic]] battle: '''[[DBZ|Goku]] or [[Superman]]'''? Much debate has been had on the [[internets]] (hell, even [[4chan]] has argued on the subject) as to who is truly the greater [[an hero|superhero]]. It has been prophesied for that the [[epic|epic battle]] will take place on the [[2012|21st December 2012]], [[divide by zero|thus causing a rip in the Space-Time Continuum]], creating an imbalance of matter and we're definitely [[OMG|all going to be fucked]] (except for Superman and Goku).

Much more likely, however, is an unbelievably [[Faggot|gay]] [[crossover]] hosted by '''DC''' and '''Shūeisha''', consisting of Goku pulled into Metropolis to help Superman defeat Lex Luthor, who will have stolen the [[Balls|Dragon Balls]] to wish himself super powers so that he can take control of the entire multi-universe.  Five pages will be devoted to the fan service duel which will, naturally, end in [[lulz|a draw]].

Google "'''Superman vs. He-Man'''" for historical context.

==Serious Business==

[[Image:GokuvsSuperman2.jpg|thumb|right|It begins!!]]

The battle is [[Serious Business]]. If you think we are [[retarded]] for believing in it you should go be [[an hero]]. One day it will happen and when it does, [[rape|we'll all be fucked]]. This'll be even worse than [[Large Hadron Collider|two Falcon Punches colliding]]. Honestly, [[you]] should [[Death|kill yourself]] right now before this happens.

This is [[true|so fucking serious]], we will gladly unload several more tired in-jokes we'll pretend are genuine "memes" at you, just to impress upon you the dire nature of this [[Shit nobody cares about|completely imaginary struggle between insanely over-powered fictional superhumans]] that are at the same time cornerstones for massive industries and also impossibly, [[Lame|impossibly lame]].

Seriously, this is right up there with [[Batman]] vs. [[Superman]], [[Star Wars|Imperial Star Destroyer]] vs. ''[[Star Trek|Enterprise]]'', and [[Sony]] vs. [[Nintendo]], in terms of ludicrous shit nerds take so seriously all you can do is stand there and stare, despairing for the continuance of our species. Besides, there's no fucking contest. [[some argue|Everybody knows]] that the Star Destroyer would tear the ass out of the ''Enterprise'' before they ran low on forward deflector shields.

==Ultimate Showdown?==

Before getting involved in this particular idiot debate, it is first important to understand the capacities of the combatants:

===Goku===

[[Image:Gokustamp.jpg|thumb|He carries his scrotum on his belt.]]

*Despite being an alien (his real name is like Cockrot or some shit), is one hundred percent [[Japan|Japanese]].

*Can go Super Saiyan 4, which is three more than Super Saiyan 1. Only faggots bother with prime-numbered Super Saiyan transformations.

*Saved the world at least 5 times, each time from horrible god-monsters who were mainly there to pick a fight with him.

*Fucked Chi Chi at least once, meaning at least once, Chi Chi's mouth was too full of dick for her to shriek her usual obnoxious, grating blather. The woman they got to dub her voice in English is like iron nails down the chalkboard of your soul if you're some wapanese faggot.

*Is the guy with a power level that was [[old meme|OVERRR NINNNNEEE THOUSAAAAANNNNDDD???]], thus forcing the internet to put up with kids who are considerably younger than the series repeating this exclamation fucking endlessly.

*Is a major player in the [[hentai]] industry. Seriously, Goku shows up in more [[Rule 34]] images than any other anime character.  Stumpy little fucker has stuck it in everything.

*Blow up planets with an energy blast, and then spend the rest of the season doing literally nothing but eat and fuck around like a spastic in a space shuttle. No, really.

*Extremely popular and yet has never been in a single [[video game]] worth a fucking damn.

*Incapable of throwing a single punch without first spending at least ninety minutes going HHHOOOHHHHHH in extreme close-up shots.

*Trained by a series of comedy perverts living in a variety of bizarre environments.

*Initially based on [[China|Chinese folktale anti-hero Sun Wu-K'ung]], the [[furry|Monkey King]], an arrogant and self-serving [[furry|trickster demigod]] who stole magic, immortality and a magic staff from a series of increasingly powerful men; picked a fight with a literal army of gods and beat the shit out of all of them; pissed right in the middle of the Buddha's palm and had a fucking mountain dropped on him in punishment. On the whole, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West way fucking better than ''Dragon Ball Z''.]

*Has made creator Akira Toriyama enough money to buy and sell you and your entire family a million times over.

*Died and was brought back to life through alarmingly retarded [[Deus Ex]] Machina magic plot devices, died again and his dipshit offspring took over for him and destroyed the franchise.

*Surrounded by mostly useless people who do very little besides bog him down.

*Immediately recognizable and infinitely lame.

*Died when an alien blew up.

----

[[Image:Übermensch.jpg|thumb|[[Nietzsche]] can't be wrong.]]

===Superman===

*Despite being an alien (his real name is like Fag-el or some shit), he is one hundred percent [[American]]. Just like [[Jesus]].

*Can move at the speed of light, but lets the Flash hang around because he's too nice a guy to tell the useless fuckwit to go screw himself.

*Can [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|fire lazers outta his eyes]], fly, and suck a bowling ball through six hundred miles of garden hose.

*Fucked Lois Lane, despite [http://www.rawbw.com/~svw/superman.html basic physics] stating more-or-less blatantly that such an action would completely obliterate the woman. Seriously, he'd literally tear her in half on his first thrust, to say nothing of ejaculate akin to artillery fire.

*Wears his underwear on the outside and nobody's ever had the balls to tell him how gay it looks.

*Can apparently hold a black hole in his hand. Fuck it, it's DC Comics. They restart the entire universe every few years.

*Has [[Pretty cool guy|saved the world]] pretty much at least once a month for the past sixty years.

*Extremely popular, and yet has starred in [[Superman 64|one of the worst video games ever made]].

*Can turn back time by flying around the world counter-rotation until it turns backwards, thus causing every scientist in the world to simultaneously [[Rage|choke to death on their own enraged bile]].

*Strong enough to push the Earth out of orbit, yet has not done so because Earth is where he keeps all his stuff (including a [[Awesome|mansion made of fucking ice]] and a [[Sick fuck|room full of wax dummies of all his friends]]).

*Creators [[Jews|Siegel and Schuster]] hilariously [[Pwn|fucked out of ownership and royalties]] by DC Comics. Same as with Bob Kane and his creation, [[Batman]], neither them nor their families have seen a fucking dime from the billions Superman has raked in.

*Died and the franchise was nearly destroyed by four dipshit replacements until he was returned to life through an alarmingly retarded deus ex machina magic plot device.

*Surrounded by mostly useless people who do very little besides bog him down (including [[furry|dog]], [[13 year old girl|female]], [[bestiality|horse]], and [[shota|younger boy]] versions of himself. Also [[wtf|Beppo the Super Monkey]]. Yes, really.

*Immediately recognizable and infinitely lame.

*Survived when a fucking galaxy exploded.

But it doesn't really matter. Someone will eventually threadjack with a [[Shoop Da Whoop]] or some other played-out meme and end the mess in instant [[fail]]. This is often used as a [[final solution]] in a Goku vs. Superman flame war, seeing as how nothing but a wild non-sequitor can possibly stop a pack of feral ADD-addled fanboys from arguing about this meaningless shit for fucking months on end, we shit you not.

Much like the endless and endlessly tiresome ninja versus pirates moderately-funny-once-for-thirty-seconds-joke-that-will-not-ever-die, Superman vs. Goku is a [[fanboy]] versus [[13 year old boy|fanboy]] debate, an argument that will rage until the combatants get bored and go back to fapping over [[loli|lolicon]] [[porn]].

As such, it is a potential lulzmine with even the most basic [[troll|trolling]], as [[basement dweller|fanboys]] are left wholly incapable of rational thought when the object of their [[sick fuck|creepily obsessive affection]] is on the line. Suggesting that, for example, [[anime]] X is [[Evangelion|pretentious]], [[Naruto|retarded]] or [[Dragonball Z|practically unwatchable]] will earn you a face full of [[internet tough guy|death threats]]. [[Mary Sue|Fanboys]] will gladly trample their own mothers to be the first to call you a [[faggot]] for disliking their favorite imaginary character or believing that a different one might be in any way superior.

It's barely sporting, but still a [[did it for the lulz|pretty fun way to kill an afternoon]].

== REAAADDYYY...FITE!! ==

             UNABLE TIO FAP TO YOUR SHOTA PORN BITCH.
Goku fanboy: Goku could literally take the energy from the black hole and use it to fuck supes up. 
             He can take the energy from the entire universe and absorb it. Superman included. You 
             can't beat that

Superman fanboy: THIS IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS. YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKER, SUPERMAN HAS FUCKING SAVED THE 
                 WORLD MOAR TIME THEN GOKU HAS HAD SEX. YOU CAN'T FUCKING BASE YOUR SHIT ON PEOPLE

             ABOUT CELL YOU DUMB SHITWIPE. HE DIDN'T USE A FUCKING SPIRIT BOMB AGAINST CELL DID HE 
             FAGGOT??!?!?!?! 

</pre>


This goes on until the thread [[404|404s]].

Notice the distinct progression of events:
First, sides are chosen and the argument escalates to [[ad hominem]] almost immediately. When that fails to score a win, completely fucking [[fuck you im a dragon|made-up]] powers are ascribed to the individual combatants and used as evidence of superiority.  Observe: at no time does either side recognize that they are not in fact discussing [[irl|'''real people''']]. By the end, nearly all text is [[ALL CAPS|caps]] and they're more or less screaming gibberish at each other, and will continue to do so until the thread capsizes or one of them passes out.

Take out the names and it's two little kids screaming "MY DAD CAN BEAT UP YOUR DAD!" at each other until one of them starts crying.

This faggotry has plagued mankind longer than [[herpes]] and is exhibit fucking A in the case against our species.

==Gokuman==
([[moar|moar]] like [[Gook|Gook]]man,[[amirite|amirite]]?)
If Goku and Superman did that [[Sound Docking|gay fusion dance]] from Dragonball Z. Cause you know DC or who ever makes Dragonball Z wouldn't let one of them lose the fight. 

==Video==

This is what happens when sad little faggots get their hands on editing software and horrible cock-rock (cos fighting should only be set to [[gay|fabulous]] dance music):
