<s>Brinks Home Security</s> [[Goatse|Broadview]] Security (as of July 2009) is both a new [[meme]] and a shitty [[WRY|alarm system]] that [[pussy]] [[liberal]]s can get [[Rape|installed]] on their [[hugbox]].

==<s>The Ad</s> Fail==

black person: *KNOCK*<br>
[[Ginger]] [[Chick]]: [[WTF|Did you hear that?]]<br>
[[Epic Fail Guy|Random Dude]]: [[O rly|It's our first night in the new house,]] do you want me to check?<br>
Ginger Chick: Ok<br>
Random Dude: *Walks to top of stair case*<br>
Random Dude: *Notices that black person is attempting to break his front door down* <strong>(Why would he knock if he's going to break in?)</strong><br>
Nigga: *THUD* *THUD* *CRACKLE*<br>
Alarm: [[WRY|WRYYYYWRYYYYWRYYYYWRYYYYWRYYYYWRYYYYWRYYYYWRYYYY]]<br>
Nigga: *sprints off into the night <strong>(Duh - Everyone knows black person run fast)</strong><br>
Random Dude: [[ALL CAPS|I SAW A GUY TRY TO BREAK IN!!!]]<br>
Ginger Chick: [[LOL_WUT|WHAT?]]<br>
Random Dude: [[No|THE ALARM - IT SCARED HIM OFF!]]<br>
[[Bananaphone|Phone: RING RING RING]]<br>
Ginger Chick: *[[Then who was phone|Picks up phone]]* [[Sup|Hello]]?<br>
[[Closet Furry|Closet]] [[Fag]]: This is [[India|Andy]] from [[Fail|Brink's Home Security]], are you alright?<br>
Ginger Chick: [[OMFG|MY HUSBAND SAW A SOMEONE TO BREAK IN]]<br>
Closet Fag: [[Switch police on|IM SENDING HELP RIGHT NAO!]]<br>

==The [[Lulz]]==

Obviously, security systems from Brinks seem to be [[over 9000]] times [[moar]] effective at deterring [[Anonymous]] than traditional [[Alex Wuori|dog curtains and phone tracing]].

Of course while the [[WRY|WRYYYY]] noise may scare [[Anonymous]] off, a black person will simply pull his [[Gun|glock]] out and [[Sean Taylor|shoot the homeowner in the cock]] for installing such [[16_year_old_girl|annoying shit]]. And of course anyone who buys such a security system is a [[pussy]] [[liberal]] who cannot use [[gun]]s, and will be therefore [[Dead|B& IRL]] by some [[The_Crackhead|piece of shit on welfare looking for cocaine money]].

==Meme Status==

Given all this win, "THE ALARM - IT SCARED HIM OFF" got meme status on /[[b]]/ and /[[k/|k]]/ for its [[Lies|correct]] portrayal of how a black person can [[No|flee like a scared kitten]]. [[Cool story bro|GREAT COMMERCIAL, BRINKS]]. YOU ARE TOTALLY GIVING PEOPLE A [[Unrealistic Expectations|REALISTIC IDEA]] OF WHAT black person DO WHEN THEY HEAR SOMEONE [[WRY|CLEARING A LEVEL ON PACMAN]].
