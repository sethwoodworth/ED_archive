== Known Side Effects ==
[[Image:Thegroup.jpg|thumb|Silly hats are awesome!]]
Due to its potent ingredients of shredded baby foreskins and [[holocaust|ashes]], he-brew has the following side effects:

* Increased beard growth ([[men]] and [[women]])
* A marked enlargement of the proboscis
* [http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=aoJKR3Jm2Yc Genital Mutilation]
* Thinking silly hats are totally [[lie|awesome]]
* Losing the ability to write in anything but [[leet|gibberish]]

== The Kike's time machine theory ==

It is now belived that the original bible was 5 times [[Longcat|longer]] than it is now. The theory suggest that the Jew used an [[Israel|Israeli]] time machine to go back in time and curse the Bible translators in their own new language. So it's belived that the Bible translators knew the future of their "holy" language and for what it will be used for, and stopped writing the bible. Therefore, not all of the Bible got translated into Kikrish and there is more to be found, that explains why the old Bible's story never really got to an end. As much as crazy as it sounds, when people get drunk and start writing, they actually complete the story of the Bible. It is well known that the [[Fag|Bible translators]] were drunk, so it makes sense that their lost voice speaks through [[alcohol|drunk]] people. Next time you get drunk, write something and give it to some old Jew, and mabye it will become a new Bible.

If you [[fail|try]] to say "[[yes]]" when you drunk, it sounds like "Ken" - כן which is the reason why Jews live in Cana'an and not in [[Canada]] (both sounds close to "Ken", ask [[black Jesus|Moses]]). Just come to some Kike, ask him if he want's more [[Jew gold|money]] ("more" because you just gave him money when you [[I came|came]] to him, remember - with Jews you ALWAYS lose)  and you'll here "KKKEEENNN!!!!".
