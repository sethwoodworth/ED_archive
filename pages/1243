'''But you are died!''' is a another example of the illiteracy that pollutes the internet. This [[forced meme]] started when a /[[b]]/tard was lurking on [[JewTube]]. What they found was a classic example of [[Engrish]].


== What was found ==                                           

While the /[[b]]/tard was watching a [[Heath Ledger]] tribute video, they noticed a comment that said:

{{quote|I love you heath ledger !!!
but you are died !|JewTube fangirl}}

The comment was made by someone claiming to be [[at least 100]] years old, and [[German]]. This means that the conspiracy theories are correct, and yes, [[Hitler]] are not died and still walks among us.

== /b/'s response ==
This resulted in an session of lulz. In the mode of [[Pretty Cool Guy]], the way to use this is to say 

{{quote|I love you (insert dead celebrity, fail celebrity or celebrity you want to be dead)!!! but you are died!}}

== [[A Challenger Appears]] ==
Recently during the non-stop raid of [[Soulja Boy]]'s chatroom, another illiterate ape spouted "The all gonna died!" or some shit like that ([[niggers]] don't speak English either)So remember kids, you are going to died. End of story. For now, you can mourn those who are but died before us. They gonna died, you gonna died, we gonna died, But they are died!!!
Nevar Forget!
