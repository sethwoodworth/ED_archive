'''Suicidechan''' ("'''Kaseychan'''","'''Minorchan'''", "'''Failchan'''", [[powerword]]: Kasey Dugan) is a [[crazy|lovely]] [[16-year-old girl|young lady]] known for her constant [[An Hero|suicide]] [[Fail|attempts]], suffering from random bouts of [[GOTIS]], and having the body of a [[loli|thirteen year old girl]].

Her story begins when her ex-boyfriend of [[Anon|unconfirmed identity]] posted her [[noods|nudes]] on /b/ and claimed that she had just attempted suicide and may be dying. She was immediately [[dox|doxed]] and promptly spammed with friend requests on her Facebook. Being the [[naive]] young teenage girl she was, she accepted these requests.

She then went to /b/ herself to dispel the rumors of her death. This lead to her being [[trolled]] hard and tricked into giving more information about herself that /b/ used to further harass her. Perhaps her first 
mistake was thinking she could reason with a 
[[b|bunch of horny 20 somethings with severe social issues]]


==The Great Debate==
Kasey presence sparked a debate amongst [[btards]], similar to [[Boxxy|the Original Queen of /b/]]. When she went on [[Tinychat]] to tearfully confront anon, she soon displayed lovable affection towards all who were actually nice to her and even put on an [[Loli|innocent]] and [[whore|chaste]] show for /b/ involving several costumes.

==Trap?==

Within weeks of Kasey's pictures being posted on /b/, users began to analyze them and a minority grew that was convinced she was a [[trap]]. The first form of evidence was a [[retarded|genius]] side-by-side comparison of infamous trap Bridget and Kasey's original Facebook profile image. btards then began dissecting her features, pointing out perceived masculine features, such as her small breasts.

Coupled with her refusal to show [[vagoo]], this faction began to harass Kasey, trying to get her to admit to having a penis but she simply ignored these threats. Tragically, [[Aspies|expert photo examiners]] of /b/ were unable to find the outline of a cock in her panty shots or even an adam's apple, leaving the trap fetishists utterly disappointed.

Based upon her location, [[Texas]], it is unlikely a tranny would be able to go unlynched by angry [[butthurt]] mobs of hicks and her [[redneck]] family doesn't seem the type to be accepting of [[fags]]. This seems to be a case of [[basement dwellers]] who fap to traps projecting onto the newest [[camwhore|chan girl]]. Which says a lot about the current [[shit|state of /b/]].
