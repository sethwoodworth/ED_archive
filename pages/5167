This famous sex technique widespread among [[Homo|Homos]] have shocked [[at least 100]] people on t3h intern3tz. Even in the [[Simpsons]] a reference was made, as shown at [http://mantrain.net mantrain.net]
At [[shit nobody cares about|leet conferences]] one can hear shouts for the mantrain, most common are:
* CHOOO CHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
* ALL ABOARD!
* JOIN THE MANTRAIN!

Many [[h4x0r|wankers]] meet in #pr0n on irc.pulltheplug.net to spank the monkey to various mantrain-alike pics.

===Research & Development===
[[at least 100|Many]] scientists researched on the question of how many men are needed for a full circle, considering [[cock]] sizes and bellies - all in a completely scientific and [[prostitution|professional]] manner. One of the discoveries resulting from this research was that if the critical mantrain mass is surpassed, the whole conglomerate may collapse into itself, causing a [[goatse|strange gaping phenomena]].

===Typical Reactions===
These were the most common reactions among heterosexual men who were exposed to the sight of a mantrain:

== World of Warcraft ==
One of the features of [[World of Warcraft]] is a "follow" command, which sets your character to automatically follow another character.  This ostensibly makes it easy for parties to stay together, and for others to lead you to difficult-to-find areas.  However, there is also no ability to stop anyone from following you whenever they choose to - probably because it doesn't affect your character directly.

Building a mantrain is the first step - it's recommended to have at least four characters for a mantrain, including the one being followed.  The best players to follow are [[newbies]], and they'll often be anybody below level 10.  Identifying a newbie is simple - when you begin following them their character will stop, visibly look around (they haven't mastered the camera yet), and then begin a series of jerking experiments to discover that, ''yes'', you are following their every move.  

Typical behavior for a mantrain is incessant chatter about irrelevant things - making sure to trigger the profanity filter as reasonably often as possible - and constant [[emote]]s, including ''/dance'' whenever the followed player stops for whatever reason.  Voice emotes will allow you to flirt, tell jokes, and generally fill up the griefed player's speakers with [[bullshit]].  Send fast-running characters off to buy booze at inns whenever you run out - the 'drunk' messages will fill up the [[chat]] window even when your characters are being actively ignored.

The only escape from a mantrain is for the followed character to die in a dungeon and run into the wilderness after resurrecting at a graveyard, or for them to log off.  An advanced griefing technique that may end up getting you banned is to add followed newbies to your friends-list so that you can follow them whenever they log on.

The final step is to watch for mention of your mantraining on the appropriate realm forum and [[lol]].
