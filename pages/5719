Never
[[Image:Hello.jpg|thumb|right|Never]]
No. Not going to happen. I don't care what [[you're]] going to say, it's not going to change anything. You might as well just [[GTFO|leave]] if you think [[you]] can do anything about it. So just leave. Now. What, you thought you could actually DO something? You? Do something? That's very sad. I mean, you're never going to accomplish anything in your life anyway. Why are you trying now? You might as well lie down and die. Nothing will ever happen because of you, so you should just stop before you hurt yourself. Really. Just stop.
