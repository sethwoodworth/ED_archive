DisneyFan01
'''DisneyFan-01''' is a 25-year-old, socially retarded, [[Disney]] [[fangirl]] and Total [[Olchai]] from the [[Republican|South]]. And quite possibly the biggest [[Suethor]] since [[MaruMariMaru]]. She lurks around [[Deviantart]] inserting herself into Disney movies, [[Dragon Ball Z]], [[Kingdom Hearts]], and Muppets. <s>She</s> her[[mary sue]] travels to various worlds trying to quench her thirst for the putrid cocks of [[ugly]] men, and even writes/draws [[crossover]] [[fanfiction]]/[[fanart]] of her [[Tatiana the Tiger|menagerie]] of [[ugly]] lovers fighting over her! Bitch may have low standards, but they're still [[unrealistic expectations|entirely beyond the realm of possibility]]. On top of all that, she's written a ridiculously long fancomic about how her self-insert and the ugly guy from some Disney movie [[ALL CAPS|SAVED KINGDOM HEARTS FOREVER.]] Or something. Honestly it's not the sort of thing that a healthy mind can easily follow, so all [[anonymous|anon]] can do is speculate. [[Image:IRL2.jpg|thumb|right| Behold: The Man Trap]] [[Image:DF-IRL.jpg|thumb|right|She denies to the death that self insertion|she is not her character]]

DisneyFan01 seriously believes that she can work for Disney animation studios and single-handedly bring back traditional animation by creating an epic Disney movie about her obviously self-insert character falling in love with Piccolo from Dragon Ball Z and that fat guy from [[Dolphy|Treasure Planet]].

[[some argue|Some others might argue]] that because all she draws is terrible fanart that is all unimaginative [[crap]], DF01 is not truly a unique and beautiful snowflake. [[lies|But they would be ''wrong'']]! Because she is [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/16675031/643496326 "''completely original and one of a kind'' "]. Just ask the [[retard]]s that [[fap]] to her work in TARTland.
It should also be noted that, despite having completed [[art school]], she is [[virgin|uncomfortable with]] [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/7488643/918822526 drawing from the nude form]. This is just one example of typical DF01 logic, in which she's A OKAY with drawing her character in semi-sexual situations with an ugly cyborg furry, but GOD FORBID she's forced to stare at any [[penis]] other than Silver's. 

===Mary Sue Mary Sue Mary Sue===
[[Image:Colo_chan_vs_John_by_DisneyFan01.jpg|thumb|left|Boys boys! Stop fighting! You can do better than this [[Aspie]] fucktard. Kill her, then find an ACTUAL woman with some class]][[Image:lulzbewbs.jpg|thumb|Marina's just an ordinary girl who goes on extraordinary adventures involving Disney worlds and Captain Hook plotting to [[rape]] her. [[lol wut]] ]][[Image:Wellsaid1.jpg|thumb|left| TL;DR Long story short DF is ripping off Twilight with her cliche' love story about selfish bitch sues]][[Image:Marina s Character Sheet by DisneyFan01.jpg|thumb|right|ttly original u guiez]][[Image:Lying_Beside_You_by_DisneyFan01.jpg|thumb|right|Marina is a fickle goddamn whore. This is so copyright lulz]]

Her only creation bearing the faint semblance of [[Original character|original]] work is her obnoxiously sweet, innocent and somehow simultaneously [[slut]]ty [[Mary Sue]] "Marina Seadrift". In a now sadly deleted scribble on DeviantART, DF01 once admitted that she modeled Marina after [[slut|Jessica Rabbit]] and [[Sailor Moon|Sailor Neptune]], among others. This is especially beautiful because Sailor Neptune is a lesbian and Jessica Rabbit brings whole new meaning to the childhood game "chubby bunny". Marina has the personality of a cardboard box, and in her character sheet, DF is grasping at straws, but saying modesty is a "flaw" and one of her personality traits is "having good balance".

<s>Disneyfan</s> Marina was originally created as a love interest for Piccolo from [[Dragon Ball Z]], otherwise known as the asexual dickless slug alien guy whom the most retarded of fangirls seem to fall in love with. Despite this hideous race of green muscular men repeatedly being portrayed as able to make babies all by their lonesome and Marina unconvincingly being portrayed as a 30 year old virgin, [[WTF|"Colo-chan" and Marina appear to have had children together????]]

Marina somehow magically got her virginity back around the same time DF01 saw Disney's giant box-office bomb "Treasure Planet" and dumped Piccolo for the even more hideous John Silver: otherwise known as ManBearPig - [[http://blog.mazoo.net/archives/silver.jpg]] We're super serial. 

DF01 immediately began to write an epic fanfic-slash-fancomic called [[shit nobody cares about| "Faithful Hearts" now known as "Faith of Heart"]], which is basically [[Kingdom Hearts]] only 100 times shittier, starring Marina instead of [[shota|Sora]] involving no [[Final Fantasy|Squarenix]] characters, [[Disney]] channel cartoons like [[fag|Phineas]] and [[emo|Ferb]] and featuring non-Disney characters like Beetlejuice. The shitty cartoon version. Marina is also instantly friends with every single Disney character she meets, plus any other character she meets, not to mention every single villain hits on her no matter if they're [[necrophilia|dead]], [[gay]], or a sack of bugs without functioning genitalia to speak of:


[[Image:Everyonethinkssheshot2.jpg|frame|center|This doesn't make her a Sue, does it?]]
[[Image:Bed_Sharing_by_DisneyFan_01.jpg|thumb|left|Disneyfan demonstrates her knowledge of anatomy and proportions]]

One random [[LJ]] user amused by this dramafest summed up DF01's self-insert Mary Sue character and her epic story perfectly:
[[Image:Df01 animatedfatty.gif|thumb|OM NOM NOM FATTY LIKES TO EAT]] [[Image:parentspfft.jpg|thumb|left|Even <s>DF01's</s> Marina's parents disapprove of her "healthy" infatuation]]
{{squote|She has a Disney princess self-insert character who goes to different Disney worlds with her best friends, Donald, Goofy and Jiminy, wielding a magic rainbow sword creating by King Mickey in order to defeat these black monsters called Nightmares (which are controlled by "those who have pure darkness in their hearts" and "feed off the light inside pure hearts") Not to mention King Mickey runs off because the stars are fading, as the "Nightmares" are destroying other "worlds," Merlin gives them the Winnie the Pooh book with missing pages, they have rocket ships piloted by Chip and Dale, and I think there's a plot where they have to rescue kidnapped Disney Princesses.

She might as well change the title from "Faithful Hearts" back to "Kingdom Hearts." This is even a more blatant ripoff than Kilala Princess. Like, she isn't even trying to be original she just has her terrible self-insert OC, and she sounds [[Scientology|too entrenched in her own fantasy to even realize how ridiculous this all is.]] 
|Some fag on [[Livejournal|LJ]]}}
[[Image:suethordreams.jpg|thumb|right|Not a Marysue living DF01's dreams, amirite?]][[Image:snowflakesue.jpg|thumb|right|Are we having fun yet?]]
DF01 also seems to believe that she can defend her character from [[Mary Sue]] accusations by giving her [[bullshit|"flaws"]], but these "flaws" tend to amount to things like: she thinks she loves puppies and kittens just a wittle toooo much and she's a sweet, naive, [[virgin]] (the best kind, [[amirite]]?)



===John Silver===

[[Image:Emocyborg.jpg|thumb|Emo John. SO CUT MY WRISTS AND BLACK MY EYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEES]]

{{quote|<small><small>Yes, I love John Silver. I can admit it. Who cares of he's an animated character!!!! He's real in my heart, and I don't want anyone to try and change my mind about it! You find me cool about it, thank you. You think I need psychological help, SCREW YOU!!!</small></small>|DF01, telling her haters to GET BENT!!}}
{{quote|Don't find me weird just because I'm in love with John Silver.|DF01, contradicting above quote.}}

Most [[suethors]] pair their [[lie|"original character"]] with a character they’re hopelessly [[obsession|in love with]]. DF01 is no different, but is in the sense that she's in love with a [[OMGWTFBBQ|fucking fatass robot bear]]. Or whatever the fuck he is. When not refining her [[crap|skills as an artist]] in art school or living vicariously through her character by placing her in almost every Disney scene she can think of, she’s drawing smut art of John Silver and <s>herself</s> her Mary-Sue. Oh nvm, they’re just cuddling. Honest!

{{quote|<small>Also, I have a doll of John I sleep with every night.  I know, I'm twenty years old and I still sleep with a stuffty. It's a little weird.</small>| DF01, stating the obvious}}

DF01 is also known to [[FanFiction.Net|twist the character of John Silver from a jolly, reasonable fellow into a whiny, self-loathing, depressed burden on everyone around him who lives to be complimented]]. This is of course common to all fangirls who inevitably have to to turn every character into an angst-driven sack of shit that only <s>they</s> their totally original character can save from the brink of despair no matter what their original disposition may be.


{{quote|<small>It's not the looks that matter in a man, it's his personality. Besides, all the good looking ones are taken.</small>|DF01, not understanding that anyone worth dating wouldn't go near her with a 35 and a half foot pole.}}

===[[Tracing]] Duhuhuhuhuhuhrama===
DF01, following in the footsteps of many a great Disney-DeviantART before her, clogs up DeviantART's severs with "art" featuring characters and poses ripped straight out of [[screenshot]]s from various Disney films. Of course she denies it up and down, while crawling back into her [[hugbox]] and crying about how she'd never do such a thing; the mere thought of anybody accusing her of such on the [[internets]] is breaking her deep, <s>autistic</s> artistic heart.

DF01 and other TARTlets have somehow gotten it into their [[stupid]] heads that "referencing" refers to the process of looking at one piece of art, copying it exactly (whilst not tracing), and calling it their own art. And since it's not directly tracing it's A-OKAY! But since her "references" tend to be wobbly, lumpy monstrosities that only vaguely resemble what she was copying in the first place, she should probably just stick to tracing.

A famous excuse of DF01 for her epic FAILURE as an artist and as a human being is a common scapegoat used by the most savvy of politicians: 

<small><small>Of course, I think I squished Hook's waist a little in the last one. But no one's perfect..</small></small>

-DF01 (LIKE NO WAI, RULLY?)

DF01 can prove she doesn't trace. She has an eyewitness.

She vainly attempts to defend her artwork in [http://disneyfan-01.deviantart.com/journal/21821327/#comments  This journal entry].

{{quote|<small><small>Real referencing occurs when an artist is trying to draw a picture, let's say of a horse walking, and suddenly says to himself 'Oh fuck I have no idea at all how horse anatomy works.'

At no point will he attempt to copy line-by-line a horse and then claim it as his beautiful and perfect work.

Now, once upon a time it was fairly obvious to all who weren't utter retards (or as they are called in Disneytard circles, "[http://comments.deviantart.com/5/16675031/643759952 psychopaths]") that DF01's work was traced. So naturally, DF01 was called out on it, overlays were produced, and [http://snarryfiend.livejournal.com/3763.html LiveJournal]posts were made [[lulz]]ing at it all.

DF01 responded in a way that totally didn't make her look [[butthurt|like a juvenile assrape victim]], because she's 23 you guys, and that sort of shit is what people grow out of by that age. Oh wait hahaha here's what really happened:
[[Image:Df01butthurt.jpg|thumb|right|DF01, "truly in tears right now." ]]
[[Image:Admits to copying.jpg|thumb|Wait, so she DOES copy screenshots!? I never would have guessed!]]
{{squote|'''I am truly in tears right now.'''

I was accused by a fellow deviant ([[redundant|not naming any names]]) of most of my pictures being traced when they are really used with references. And now my heart is in a lot of pain and I'm not just saying that to get to all of you. My heart is really hurting. I was even told that I would be banned because of this false accusation.

I don't want that to happen.

[[Image:orlycopy.jpg|thumb|right|You don't say.]]Naturally, this ridiculous explosion of attention-whoring over what could be seen as a trite matter really endeared DF01 to the haters. Dozens of fans, all equally as mentally stunted as DF01 herself, flocked to her hugbox entry to tell her to not listen to the "''[http://comments.deviantart.com/5/16675031/643476792 anti-Disney fan creeps]''", because after all, [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/16675031/643522455 they] [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/16675031/643634602 are] [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/16675031/643504436 just] [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/16675031/643499663 jealous.] [[logic|QED]], bitches!

===DisneyFan01 on Youtube===

Like any true internets user, {{youtube2|JohnSilverfan01|DF01}} has herself some [[YouTube]] videos. She has recently taken up the hobby of begging her mindless fans to give her videos some thumbs up. [http://disneyfan01.deviantart.com/journal/17849197]
Witness the fruits of her animation studies and see just how wrong [[ED]] has been about this [[LOL WUT|amazingly talented]] [[art school|art student]]:

Next Marina gets a voice, the voice of the animated harlot who in the late 80's single-handedly sexually confused so many of the young men who now spend their days [[fap]]ping to [[animu]] tentacle porn: Jessica Rabbit. [[irony|Ironically]] DF01 chose the famous, iconic phrase "I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way":

<center><youtube>RhI-F7Azir4</youtube></center>

Apparently she just wants Marina to come across as a 30 year old [[virgin]] [[whore]], because she continues the trend of making her sound like a cliche sassy sex-bomb from a 1940's film. Observe: {{Youtube|uUxku35TTrY}}

On top of that her fans have made [[over 9000]] [http://youtube.com/results?search_query=Marina+Seadrift&search_type= fan tribute videos] to <s>DisneyFan01's</s> Marina Seadrift's and John Silver's love.

With her totally original art and her totally mature attitude drawing bottom-feeding [[asspat]]ters like moths to a flame of suck, DF01's fans were quick to carry the burden of [[butthurt]] back to their own journals, generating a mass influx of BAAAWWWing into DA's drama-abused database all about how horrible horrible haters are e-bashing DF01 and how run-on sentences make for more shitty articles. Remember, folks - You can safely ignore and throw away any comments that are critical of you and your art, but those mindless and contentless comments giving you and your art praise are an entirely different [[vagina|kettle of fish]]! Because the former are just jealous of your mad piss-all-over-[[Disney]] skillz. And besides that, what they are saying is [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/16675031/643639935 slander.] [[Slander, Slander Salamander|SLANDER, SLANDER SALAMANDER]].

So back to the point, there are now several journals on DA bitching about how people should [[buttsex|lay off'a]] DF01. Mostly they are, in the process, attacking fellow TARTlet [http://www.kellywormtongue.deviantart.com kellywormtongue], known to us on ED through retarded [[Snapesnogger]] drama, and [http://www.fallenbybrokenwings.deviantart.com fallenbybrokenwings] who apparently deserves to be killed for all of this. Because DF01 is too busy wading in her own [[emo]] tears to defend herself, and since [[irony|it isn't nice to pick on other deivants]], she'll let her rabid, retarded fanbase avenge her instead.

===OMG TEH PUPULAR AHTEESTS DON'T LUV MEH===
Y'see children, DF01 is under the impression that anybody who +watches her on DevianTART is automatically her [[BFF]], and must [[circlejerk]] with her whenever she so desires it. So when one of her BFF's took the side of reason over the whole tracing fiasco, DF01 never went crazy on QuietWatcher, just a few of her rabid fans.
{{quote|<small>I never claimed to be your friend so don't anyone send me nasty messages about being a traitor or whatever. I'm just a watcher, and right now I can't be as quiet as I would like.</small>|quietwatcher, [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/16675031/643639666 LOL]}}

[[Last Thursday]] DF01 posted a comment on one of [http://www.kellywormtongue.deviantart.com kellywormtongue]'s [http://kellywormtongue.deviantart.com/art/The-Liar-77502423 drawings] in hopes to <s>reconcile</s> have Kellywormtongue link to her shitty art again. It was known that Kellywormtongue commented occassionally (before DF01 was outted as a tracer) on DF01's pictures which, in DF01's [[retard|special, delicate mind]] meant that they were BFFs. Even though Kellywormtongue said in the description of the picture that it was about a [[emo|nightmare]], DF01 naturally assumed it was about her:

[[Image:Dfkwlulz.jpg|thumb|center|300px|Lulz.]]
[[Image:Backinlove.jpg|thumb|center|300px| Spoiler Alert: Kelly came back to DA just to lick DF's ass]]

Most understand that DF01 is trying to get a [[hugbox]] out of KellyWormtongue because she used to link to her page. After a rabid anti-fangirl of DF01, [[User:Fallenbybrokenwings|Fallenbybrokenwings]], showed what this [[lolcow]] really is, Kellywormtongue stopped associating herself with the tracing cunt and took down fanarts she did of [[Mary Sue|Marina]]. Anyone with half a brain knows that the only reason DF01 is bawwing so much over Kellywormtongue is because she gave her most of her page views.

===The Fanherd===

</gallery>}}

For reasons unknown, DF01 has a fanherd so large, it could compete with [[Snapesnogger]]'s legion of mindless tards. These folk seem to think that pageviews equal artistic skill. All of them seemed to have an understanding that tracing is soul-raping art theft until [[Dolphy|a more talented Disney-tard]] with a [[Dolphy#The_Basics|nearly identical Treasure Planet Mary-Sue]] (and the sense to get wet over [[pedophile|the nubile adolescent boy]] rather than the fat disgusting robo-bear) wrote a rambling journal about how [http://dolphy.deviantart.com/journal/16700903 DF01 is innocent] because she doesn't trace, she just poorly copies what she sees. 

'''This just in''' DF01 has announced on her [http://disneyfan-01.deviantart.com/journal/19609027/ journal] that she is going to halt production on her current comic and pursue something new!  This is hope that perhaps something of substance with believable characters and a more mature story line may be in her future, but her fans [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/7488643/791510699 are not pleased that she's 'giving up'].

DF01's fans also take it upon themselves to defend her against the OMG HATERZ, whether it's [[spamming|scoping]] out her comments box ready to pounce on the slightest critique, or making journal entries on her behalf, telling her critics to [[Britney Spears|LEAVE HER ALOOOOONE!!!]]


{{squote|Okay, there is this thing going on that I just realized. People are bashing (disneyfan01)  about her artwork! I've seen her artwork and it's super good! People keep bashing her and I think it's not right! So if you're one of those people, please stop! I also think (kombat-unit)  is being waaaaaaaaaay harsh on her. So please stop. 

Anyways, that's pretty much it.

[[Role-playing|Alvin: So not! Did you forget what happened at school?]]

Me: [[ADD|Oh yeah!]] I have great news! My crush Zack asked me out! So I obviously said yes! But when we were talking at PE, little miss "wicked-witch-of-the-west-cast" (also known as [[dox|Shelia Gonzalez]]) started talking about us and how we were going to make out! It was sooooooo embarrasing! Luckily Zack is a [[oxymoron|nice guy and cussed out Shelia]] and defended me! Ha! Anyways, Zack is [[whore|one]] of my loves now! 

But that's soooooooooo not the point! I'm still mad at everyone who bashes (disneyfan01) !!!!!!!  

STOP BASHING HER PEOPLE!|[http://crazycartoongirl.deviantart.com/ CrazyCartoonGirl] is crazy.}}



A few of her right hand men include:
*Keblademasteress[http://keblademasteress.deviantart.com/] is a no talent sycophant who has to take movie quotes as a substitute for comebacks. She also doesn't realize the feminine form of "master" is "mistress" and is incapable of spelling words as simple as "key."  Her hobbies include long walks on the beach, crying to DF01 when someone says something mean to her, spamming people with RP comment threads, and vomiting on her keyboard to help write incoherent sentences. Let it also be known that she is [[Delusional|madly in love with]] [[JohntheEnforcer]]. Was recently banned for RPing porn in deviation comments. [http://i43.tinypic.com/aeptgp.jpg][http://i42.tinypic.com/301k1ow.jpg][http://i39.tinypic.com/331od5f.jpg]
*[[JohntheEnforcer]] is a 28 year old man who still lives with his parents and likes Sonic the Hedgehog. His love for [http://keblademasteress.deviantart.com/ Keblademasteress] burns with the fiery passion of a thousand suns.  
*[http://caseygraves.deviantart.com/ Casey Graves] wants to be Dolphy soooo bad. 
*[http://coppertopdragon.deviantart.com/ Coppertopdragon] the man who loves DF01 and doesn't seem to comprehend that she would rather be alone, obsessing over an overweight bear thing than be with him. [[Pwned]].
*[http://chibi-schnurri.deviantart.com/ Chibi-Schnurri] is a DBZ fangirl whose artwork looks like it came right out of MS paint. She's also in love with Captain Ginyu of the Ginyu Force, but will only kind of admit it [http://chibi-schnurri.deviantart.com/journal/17876204/#comments]. She's also a massive lying attention whore.
*[http://maskedsugargirl.deviantart.com/ Maskedsugargirl] is OMG [[weaboo|SUPER KAWAII DESU!!!!!111 :3 ^w^]]She also likes to lick DF01's ass every day, acts as her slave, and probably the most annoying disciple of DF01.
*[http://destiny-star.deviantart.com/ Destiny Star] can't seem to pull her tongue out of DF01's ass. Possibly her most hardcore followers.
*[http://morty340.deviantart.com/ Morty340] He is a pathetic faggot that just recolors sprites and claims it as his art.  His comebacks fail at everything and yet he continues to try even though we all know he fails.
*[http://chibikan.deviantart.com/ Chibikan] A closet die-hard DF01 fan from [[Ohio]] who will [[:Image:Tenderheart.png|take you down]] even if she does choose to represent herself as a CareBear.
*[http://herbaldrink.deviantart.com/ HerbalDrink] Should probably make one of his "Don't do this" for DF-01's work, he's soooo good at them on the Complaints Forum.

===June 02, 2008. A Day That Will Live In Infamy===
[[Image:DF01_banned.jpg|thumb|right|Well.]]
[[Image:DF01hax.jpg|thumb|"[http://comments.deviantart.com/5/18631199/742939385 We're here for ya, girl. I'm praying for you.]"]]

[[Image:Loldisneyfan01forum.PNG|thumb|right|lol]]On this day, a clever anon posted a link to a fake login bar in her comments, which was supposed to lead to fan art. Several noble TARTS claimed to have seen this fan art[http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2730558/741996247?offset=5470#comments](thru page 551, then the lulz begin). Taking the bait, she soon found herself locked out of her account.

Before [[delete fucking everything|replacing]] her shitty artwork with lulzy shock images, the "hacker", pretending to be DF01, posted a journal entry stating that ED has won, shes quitting internet forever, and moving in with Coppertopdragon. Massive lulz ensued as her fantards actually believed [http://disneyfan01.deviantart.com/journal/18631188/ she was tired of life and just ''gave'' her password to ED to vandalize her page] and was going to give up her beloved Mary Sue for her new life with coppertopdragon and her new [[job]] working at Disney (Like any one would believe Disney would ever hire her). The very idea her fans would actually believe she'd not only settle down with a real man but get a real job speaks to just how retarded they are. However, they still fail to realize that vandalizing an ED page is pointless, while vandalizing a DA page is pure win.

After at least three hours of bitching and reporting, the DA mods put down the pipe and banned DF01's account([[not|Goodnight, sweet prince.]]). But not fast enough to keep those pesky anon from screencapping all of the glorious lulz. The gallery below is an example fantards at their most violent, the most notable being [http://yuiharunashinozaki.deviantart.com/ YuiHarunaShinozaki], who's reactions raise an important question: Which is worse, spamming a DA page with [[goatse]], or throat-backstabbing one for doing so?

DF01 made her return as Disneyfan-01, the most original name ever, shortly after receiving it up her butthole. Her fans, displaying their intelligence, rejoiced, having feared she was left for good. In addition, several comments made by them show us all that the internet is a place for rainbows and sunshine, completely ignoring the fact that it was DF01's fault for the whole hacking incident. 

All fans could sigh in relief, they would soon feed off of her feces again as she posted her old images.

==DF01 in the Real World==
===Career===
{{squote|Yes I did. Majored in animation.
Right now I work at Walt Disney World as a Cast Member and I'm waiting for an opening at the drawing department there. That's where artists draw characters for the guests, from Mickey to the new Disney Fairies are drawn in the style an animator would draw them.|On working at Disney World}}
[[Image:Disneyfan01PedoDefenderWTflol.JPG|thumb| DF01's part-time job when not tracing the shit out of Disney is: being a [[Sick fuck|strong, liberated denfender]] of the [[child molester| Kiddy Fiddler Club]], sponsoring for the deceased and beloved, [[Wacko Jacko]]. And some [[BAWW]] ]]

As of May 2009, DF01 was apparently working at Walt Disney World as a "cast member". Like most students that waste their time and money getting a degree that will get them nowhere in life (see Music Performance and Philosophy), DF01 got hers in animation and is now putting it to use by being a "cast member". 
When pressed further, DF01 reveals 
{{squote|No.
A Cast Member is what they call anyone who works there. I'm what most managers call a host. I like to see myself as a life guard because I work at a playground.|-Aka, you'll be stuck there a while.}}

{{squote|Full time at Hollywood Studios, Honey I Shrunk the Kids Playground.}}

This is bullshit, however, as if you look up "host"on the Walt Disney World job website, the only results returned are in the "custodial" department. So really, she's just a janitor who happens to work at Walt Disney World. If you mention this, however, her page-lurking fans tend to make up ridiculous excuses saying that "once you're in, you're in." Apparently that means that you too can delude yourself into thinking that cleaning up kid piss and vomit all day will get eventually get you a job working as either an animator or a character artist.

===Her "Love Life"===
[[Image:Df01-is-a-bitch-omg.jpg|thumb|left|A tender love note sent betwixt the lovers]][[Image:BURNN.jpg|thumb|left|What a poor pathetic little fuck.]][[Image:Tartlets.jpg|thumb|right|OMGZ U BETTER TAEK THAT DOWN U BONG BOOGER BRAIN!!!]][[Image:Lies1.jpg|thumb|left| DF01 tells some very sad/pathetic truth]][[Image:Tartlets2.jpg|thumb]]
Disneyfan01 is also a typical Suethor in that she is obsessed with a fictional character to the exclusion of any real person. Prime example is this poor bastard. [http://coppertopdragon.deviantart.com/art/I-am-the-foo-dog-ninja-64195918]
His name is Randle Rodgers, a.k.a. Coppertopdragon and he leads what seems to be (SRSLY?) a sane, relatively normal life.  He works at Disney World at a ride nobody ever bothers with unless the line for Space Mountain is too long, he has some poetry on his page DeviantART that doesn't suck too much ass, and was DF01's one-time roommate[!?].  What appears to be the only major source of fail in his life is the fact that he is in love with Disneyfan01.  That's right, this moron actually wants to stick his [[cock|p3nor]] in DF01's stanky, centipede-infested [[cunt|vag]]! 

[[Image:norealmen.png|thumb|left|DF01 explains why John Silver is her only romantic option in life]]

According to several reports from various Myspace sources from their hometown, this stupid bitch has been running this poor son of a bitch around in circles for years!  Reportedly, they went to school together from the 6th grade.  He has professed his love to her on several occasions, and she has turned him down in favor of some animated character that doesn't even exist!  This raises a compelling question:  Is it more pathetic to finger your twat while fantasizing about a robo-bear, or to pine after the girl that engages in such disgusting behavior?  The debate among scholars continues.

Clearly, this assclown is in love with her beyond reason! Why, you might ask, would such an exceptionally [[retarded|gifted]] man decide to love this girl?  Simply put, he has hope that one day she might change her mind about her [[emo|"loner philosophy"]] and love him like a real woman would.  Like that's ever going to happen, since she is obsessed with fucking a goddamn cartoon bear-borg to the exclusion [[what|of dating a real man who is constantly throwing himself at her feet]].

[[Image:Sex slavz.jpg|thumb|right| DF01 caught cheating on Manbearpig.]]

===[[ALLCAPS|EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT!!!!!!  I KNOW HER!!!!!!  ]]===
[[Image:BUTTHURT.JPG|thumb|And still she denies it]]
The following testimony was written by someone who may or may not have been DF01's roomate. How anybody could stand living with her is anyone's guess. All it really does is assure what the general public already knew: that DF01's nothing but a pretentious little aspie, with absolutely no concept of reality, let alone what constitutes as good art.
{{squote|I [[o rly|actually]] went to school with this girl, and not only is she a talent less hack, a stuck-up bitch, delusional and uninformed about the lack of respect from other students, but her freshmen year was known to body-chuck people in the hallway, unaware of the common practice of 'asking people to move'.  

As one of her roommates freshmen year, I found out she does indeed have [[aspergers|aspergers disorder]], and according to the online sources, [[shit no one cares about|a common displacement of reality is for the person to mistakenly envision themselves as an 'idiot savant' or 'rare genius' in some creative field.]]  Needless to say, another symptom I witnessed is an unhealthy addiction to TV, movies, and video games.  Gosh, I wonder.... not that I don’t enjoy listening to her mimic Pee Wee Herman quotes endlessly.  That’s how you make friends, right?  Parrots have more charm.    

I love how she posts a picture of the animation lab in Kinney Hall (art school in Columbus, OH) pretending her spoiled minimum-wage forever ass could ever afford, I'm sorry, MOMMY AND DADDY could afford her very own light table for *gasp* tracing.  Because that's what it's for.

I *am* relieved to be enlightened that she is still indeed a virgin; it means she has yet to love someone more then herself.|DF01's ex-roomate}}


DF01 has alleged that she has an IQ of 135, which she also gave to her self insert mary sue. In DF01's own words: 

"...And as for the I.Q., I gave her the same number as mine because I want her to be smart above average, but not a genius. That's just what I am. So, I just decided on that."

lulz

Further proof that this asspie can not have an I.Q. of 135, she completely gushes on her dev journal about loving the Dragon Ball: Evolution movie. Anybody with '''half''' a brain didn't even go see that shit, but DF01 did. And she's probably making a bawful fic about her new and improved(?) version of 'Collo-chan'


[[Image:idiotdf01.jpg|thumb|left|Further proof a [[retard]]ation]]


One must wonder how she functions properly with no brain.


==Amazing and Clever Retorts==
DF01 is also known as the epitome of maturity, below are examples of her witty replies to the many people who offer any comment other than "OMG SILVER AND MARINA FOREVARRZ".


<center>{{morphquote|mqtest|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;

|You think you can do better? Prove it! Hah! You can't! And My teachers say I have potential! So I WIN and you suck!| DF01's reply to someone who critiqued her animations on Youtube, in which she fails to realize that "potential" is code for "you suck and may continue to suck in the future".

|GET BENT!|DF01's favourite comeback.

|How would you know? I don't see you in the class. And I'm not slacking off. I said I'm a lot better now than when this was made. This was one of my first tries in animation. You think you can do better?|DF01, displaying ignorance that one doesn't have to be an artist to recognize shitty art.

|My artwork is my children!|Not being creepy or grammatically incorrect at all.

|haha, that's so funny I forgot to laugh. GET BENT! Stop reading the lies you read on that ED shithole!|Lies? I guess she can't stand looking in a mirror.

|You think my stuff sucks?! I'd like to see you try if you think you're all that. Get bent!!|Using her signature line.

|Well, believe me that I am working on some things that are very original. Let's see what they'll[ED] have to say about that.|More *~**OrIgInAl**~* Mary-Sues eh? Yeah, just what we want.

|Ho ho and ha ha, so funny I forgot to come home next week.|  DF01 has begun deluding herself.

|Either you back the hell off and have that page deleted ((most likely referring to ED)), or things are going to get rough with the law, you bong residue brain!| Srsly, what kind of comeback is that?  She also seems to think that tracing is lawful and paying someone out is unlawful.

|Yeah, like you and yo momma| DF01, after being called a retard. Apparently she's black person now.

|Silver is more human than he is bear, but quit while you're behind.| A poor attempt at reverse psychology.

|Die. You are not funny
You are not cool
You are not better than everyone else.
You are just a sick bastard who just comes up out of nowhere and show off the most disgusting image ever for absolutely no reason what so ever. Go ass rape yourself with a rusty razor blade and die.|On getting NIMP'D
