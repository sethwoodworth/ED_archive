The '''Goddess Bunny''', or Sandie [[Brandon Crisp|Crisp]] as s/he is known, is one of the more disturbing non-[[porn|pornographic]] video stars on the [[internets]], because he looks like a mix between a [[holocaust]] victim and [[Chris Crocker|Britney Spears]] due to being stricken by [[AIDS|polio]] as a child. Sandie became a minor [[internet celebrity]] by appearing in [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnxtk53KJ1g this video] and the band Punk Bunny's video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jelYpyXIsM8 Water Sports]. More notable was her appearance in Marilyn Manson's Dope Show video, as an object of sexual affection for Manson and crew. Sandie also appeared in a Carrie Fisher movie called "Hollywood Vice Squad".

It should be noted that Sandie is actually a guy, whose real name is Johnnie Baima. It is interesting to note that Sandie/Johnnie is a [[transvestite]], not a [[transsexual]]; this means he has a [[penis]] and wants to keep it.

Some [[sick fuck|retard]] decided he wanted to make a documentary about this thing, consisting mostly of archival footage and an interview, in which Sandie revealed that he was [[raped|loved in the ass & mouth]] repeatedly throughout childhood, including once in a [[party van|van]].
