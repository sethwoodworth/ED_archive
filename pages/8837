Vox's Posse
[[Image:Voxs posse portrait.jpg|thumb|right|A foxtaur gorged with bunny babies is sexy, [[no]]?]]
'''Vox's Posse''' may sound like a name for a furry gang that does [[gang rape]] everyday, but the reality is much more horrid than that. Vox's Posse, also known as '''Vox''' and '''xionzappa''', possesses an ego so huge, it doesn't realize that even villains are not immune to the curse of cliches and [[Recolor|cutouts]] made from [[butt]]s and [[cock]]s [[OM NOM NOM|munching away at pieces of paper]] decorated with his [[No|lovely]] face. Yes, we're calling it an '''it''' because it is into bunnies and feminine males with which it does... [[DracoGuard|things.]] It loves sharing its [[Lie|vast repositories of knowledge]] with other voraphiles and barking orders around its [[Slut|playmates]]. [[JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!|And it will hunt you down if you don't follow its orders to the letter.]]
==Notable Porn Stories==
[[Image:DLDR.PNG|thumb|left|Vox's typical [[attention_whore|attention]] whoring post]]
Vox's Posse is most renowned for his Tales of Epsilon, which is on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere where [[Baw|everyone apparently gives a shit, but doesn't do anything]]. Ruled by the [[No|lovable]] Vox, there are four major tales that take place in this island:
*[http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=171368 Tale One of Epsilon - Spark of luck]: Get out your eye bleach, because you will need it. Vox's Posse dumps a shit-load of information about the laws of his wet dream, which are [[Srsly|none]]. Not only that, the [[fursona]] of his bestest buttbuddy, [[sick_fuck|Sparky the Chu,]] pops in as a main character along with several other [[Pokemon]] for absolutely [[self-insert|no reason]]. Everyone who read the story cried at the end, but only because they had a three-second delay in realizing being tricked into being eaten is one of Sparky's most euphoric fantasies.
*[http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=172760 Tale Two of Epsilon - King Me]: Part two holds almost no real connections to part one, other than introducing [[Fantard|robotic clones of his buttbuddy]] shoved inside King Vox's gut in order to video tape the deaths of his meals so he can post it up on Youtube. Essentially, all you're doing is viewing Vox's Posse's [[Unrealistic expectations|deepest, darkest desires.]] 
{{squote|1="I used to be a human, actually. I'm from a planet called Earth. Only humans lived there and they thought they were the only species in the galaxy. I remember my life pretty well, up to my eighteenth birthday. I can remember the day before it just fine, but then the memories just stop. Next thing I remember, I woke up as a fox-taur on this world. That seems so long ago. Truth is, I'm not really sure what I am, but I do know what I can do." ... "I have complete and utter control over every thread of reality on this entire planet. I can create, control, alter and destroy anything that I wish."|2=Vox's Posse|3=[http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=172760 Tale Two of Epsilon - King Me], using a writer's cop out for his [[fetish]] fantasy}}
*[http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=175879 Tale Three of Epsilon - Faded Flowers]: A sob story where the author fulfills his wish of reforming a prey character, because a set of pictures made him [[masturbate|cry]]. In particular, [http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=10761 this one.]
{{squote|1=Okay, this story has a bit of history to it, so before we get to the good stuff, you're gonna have to listen to me ramble. I apologize in advance.

When I first entered the vore community, I saw a series of pics that broke my [[cock|heart.]] Uvuzi devouring a poor bunny who was offering her flowers. Here are the first pictures in the series: http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=10761 http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=10764 http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=10767

Those pictures broke my heart. [[emo|I really felt]] for the poor [[attention_whore|thing]], seemingly just wanting to make a friend. Soon after, I ran into [[sick_fuck|Strega]] in a chat room and asked (well, more like [[buttsex|begged]]) him to let me reform the little guy. I was amazed when he agreed. Ever since then, due to his generosity, [[mary_sue|Damien]] has been one of my favorite characters, a carefree little bunny lamia. Recently, I've wondered...[[rape|what ever happened to his family?]] I always assumed Uvuzi ate them, and I realized Damien had never really [[an_hero|come to grips with that as a character.]] This inspired me to write [[shit_no_one_cares_about|Faded Flowers]].

I warn you as the [[sick_fuck|reader]] now, this isn't like my other two Epsilon stories. This is far less [[fetish|fetishy]] and dark and far more [[emo|emotional]]. There is vore in this story, but it happens early on and the story continues long after it. If you're looking for a porn story, this isn't it. I tried to write something emotional about a character I feel very close to and I can only hope I succeeded. Please leave a comment when you're done. I put [[cock|a lot]] into this story and hope the reader feels [[pervert|something]] from it. Enjoy!|2=Vox's Posse|3=putting his journal in the artist's comments}}

[[Image:Arttheif.PNG|thumb|Creativity? What's that?]]

*[http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=183722 Epsilon Side Story - Hope]: Vox's Posse's first attempt to actually develop prey items as actual beings. However, it is really, really hard to sympathize with a [[furfag]] child, especially when their parents are [[retarded]] enough to trust a daycare center which probably has an [[furfag|anthro]] [[pedo]] raccoon that eats children with its cock employed as a daycare caretaker. Or maybe they sent their child to the daycare so the caretakers can have another child [[whore]]. The picture that's posted on the wall in the end is only there so Bags, the caretaker that ate the "sympathetic victim", can [[masturbate]] furiously. [[Srsly|To believe someone commissioned him to use the same brain lapses in here is rather unbelievable.]]
*[http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=183577 Epsilon Side Story - Marl's Fate]: You don't really need a summary from us. Well, except for a quote:
{{quote|1=[[Unrealistic Expectations|As he closed his eyes for what he thought was the last time, he praised the creature all around him, calling him perfect, marveling at the splendor of what would be his new world, his new place in life. And then, Marl fell asleep, never expecting to wake up.]]|2=Vox's Posse|3=[http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=183577 Epsilon Side Story - Marl's Fate]}}
In other words, the commissioner basically [[DO NOT WANT|paid for the honor of sucking Vox's Posse's cock.]]

==Roleplaying his way: It's ''the'' [[law]]==
[[Image:Voxs posse into little boys.jpg|thumb|left|[http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q228/ryuhaku_todoh/00118_panda_heso_122_664lo.jpg A fine example of the perfect penis for Vox's Posse.]]]
#You cannot eat his [[mary_sue|characters.]]
#If you do, they must not die.
#However, [[rage|you must die.]]
#You must be gullible.
#You must be [[pervert|horny.]]
#You must not fight, even while being raped.
#Only Vox's Posse is allowed to [[usi|godmod.]]
#He finds people who do combat RPs with him laughable, but only because he can godmod his way through.
#Provide [[Pedo|soft, tender penises of little kids,]] like in the picture to the left, [http://s137.photobucket.com/home/ryuhaku_todoh/recentuploads?page=4 taken from his photobucket profile.]

Basically, rping with your friendly neighborhood Vox is simple. You sit there and get [[fun|raped]] repeatedly, and then eaten. If you don't like that, he'll [[rage|ask]] you why you're [[cyber_sex|roleplaying]] with him. Chances are, you're a gullible piece of [[voraphile|voraphilic]] shit he begged to roleplay with.

(If you missed them, go back and read over it again. There are exactly 3 [[logic|logic]] fails hidden in that paragraph!)

Of course, if you do do what you're told and allow yourself to get raped and eaten, you can still [[rage|anger]] the great Vox's Posse if you don't do exactly what he says. This is because you have no free will of your own. This guy, he's important. If you don't kiss his ass enough, he might just ridicule you publicly for not bowing to him.

And then, as if that's not bad enough, he will talk crap about you behind your back, even going so far as to mock his rape victim (the character you used to give him something to fuck). He's actually pretty infamous for saying nasty things to people in private after an rp, but we have yet to get a hold of any of these notes or chat transcripts because, well, everyone [[emo|deletes]] theirs as not even vorefags have time for this guy's shit. But if you look at the section on the Suethor battle below, we can confirm that that spawned many [[no_u|hate filled]] exchanges in private.

==Chat Behavior==
Vox's Posse has only a few options of behavior on a chatroom. In an [[ronery|idle]] state, he will simply post repeated LFRP nonsense, generally stating that his current character is lounging around and looking [[whore|sexy]]/[[lie|cute]]/bored/[[vore|hungry]]/[[FYIAD|whatever the hell he wants]]. Upon being approached, his behavior depends solely upon the literacy of the victim. If the person is capable of speaking decent English, he will [[rape|be perfectly willing to RP with them, and will proceed to destroy their soul at the conclusion of the RP, regardless of whether they consented to such treatment or not.]] When called out on this, he will [[rage|angrily declare]] that he [[lie|does nothing that the other person asked for]]. Apparently, [[sarcasm|looking at Vox means you're just asking to have your soul destroyed]]. Note: every character profile includes a note that the character can "digest souls and reform prey." However, his characters never reform prey unless the prey is another of his own characters. Or a moderator.

For those [[moron|people who fail to meet the literacy standards required to die at the hands of Vox's posse]], he refuses to take the logical route and inform them that he is not interested, or to simply ignore them. Instead, he finds such LOLCREATIVE ways of ridding himself of unwanted furries as picking them up and placing them near someone else who is clearly trying to avoid them, or [[wat|having a brain-damaged penguin row them into the middle of a lake and abandon them there under pretenses of treasure]]. Of course, [[fail|anyone dumb enough to require this treatment immediately godmods their way back, anyway]].

On a separate level are chat moderators and artists, whose legs Vox will hump on sight. These are completely immune to his usual reckonings on literacy (though his main [[bitch|bodyguard]], Tristan Hawthorne, claims to be an [[grammar nazi|English major]]). However, he doesn't care whether a person speaks more eloquently than Shakespeare or talks like a black person on [[crack]] if they can either protect him from scary people criticizing him, or draw him free pictures.

[[TL;DR]] Vox pisses off smart people, fails to deal with dumb people, and kisses the asses of mods and artists. A good way to troll him would be to pretend to actually seek an RP, and proceed to insist that what he's doing is [[YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG|wrong]].

==[[I DUNNO LOL|How does I count characters?]]==
Although Vox's Posse has created [http://www.villichat.net/cgi-bin/yumchat/desc.cgi?Voxs_posse a plethora of characters], you only need to know the one master template for all his sadistic villains: 
The [[USI|self proclaimed]] [[Original Character|‘Sexiest fox-taur named Vox in the universe.’]] Every vicious predator, like Vox, has a [[Mary_Sue|heart of gold]] underneath piles of fluff [[OM NOM NOM|growling for your flesh.]] This is to make sure that when they [[Fap|devour]] you, they can give you a long, passionate [[Yiff|fuck session]] before [[Buttsecks|shoving you up their asses]], which is the most preferred method. The second most common method is a strange form of [[Sound Docking|docking]] where the predator shoves more than your cock inside his cock. The rarest method of them all, which appeals to most [[voraphile]]s is the classical snake-like eating style. The best part? You can't fight back! Of course, you're safe if you possess no morals. They love [[16 year old girl|innocents]]. 

Despite the cruelty of his villains, they end up saving people you should [[Mary Sue|obviously care for.]] Everyone has the same set of morals, so even heartless psychopaths should care for nice, hard working people who don't get what they "deserve" in life. If you don't, you're worse than Vox: You don't even have feelings! It makes you wonder if Vox actually imagines about eating the people he saved. They ''are'' innocents, you know.
===[[Self-insert|Scratch that, there's only one]]===
Recently, Vox's Posse revealed [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1405373/ the most obvious thing ever,] except for the fact that it turns out that [[Wut|everything takes place in or on his fursona]]. Of all the fursonas, even the unusual [[DrMusic2|werejohncandy/grinch]], [[Fantasy|why make it a world?]] Mr. Vox's Posse, as always, has a mindnumbing tale that [[ALL CAPS|YOU MUST LOVE]]:
{{quote|1=First off, lemme talk about Vox. What he is. He was originally a black cat anthro. The name came from a character from the old game 'Loaded' for PS1. She was a female DJ who killed people with soundwaves. The fox-taur idea came when I saw this picture http://www.chakatsden.com/chakat/Images/alle.jpg I just fell in love with that personality, that confidence. I was very shy at the time. [[Art theft|I wanted that to be my character.]] [[USI|Confident]], [[sex]]y, [[Redundant|arrogant, vain]], kind of a handsome, slightly villonous predator obsessed with beauty, [[Mary_sue#Furry.21Sue|inspired heavily by Vega from Street Fighter.]] Oh what a long way I've come.

For a while, Vox was that. [[Wambulance|I mean, the whole 'god of a world' only came up about a year ago. Around the time of the VOCT. Coincidence? No. The tournament scared me and I became afraid of what would happen if someone took Ploro's soul.]] It really, REALLY got to me. I mean, I knew it was just a non cannon story, but such cool entries made me feel weak and a little usless. So I decided I was going to do two things. I was going to start writing and I was going to make Vox powerful.
...

Beforehand, I just had attacks bounce off fact for no reason. He just wasn't there for combat. I gave him a story. I made him the spirit of a world. [[Mary Sue|Gave me a reason he's so strong, a way to protect the souls of my prey chars]] and [[Wat|a setting for my stories.]]|2=Vox's Posse|3=[http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1405373/ his journal]}}
[[TL;DR]], [[Self-insert|Vox only exists as a wish-fulfillment device.]] 

So if Vox is a wish-fulfillment device, then what are the characters that Vox saves? Why Vox's Posse, of course!

Isn't it ironic for his ego that he's inserted himself as both the damsel in distress and the tyrant in his little world?
==He's got no idea what he's talking about==
Vox's Posse's mind is [[Sarcasm|absolutely astounding.]] Here are some valuable nuggets of knowledge he wants to share with [[you]].
{{morphquote|mqtest|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;
|...No. I don't think so. To be a god you have to be born a god and have control over some element, right? I'm just a controller. I rule over my little speck in the galaxy and that's that.

|Unless Sparky got one very angry, he knew he didn't need to worry.

I guess Epsilon still uses candles...

|The only problem was, Vox already had a mate. With the amount of sex that both Vox and Dizzy partook in, neither was angry, yet the problem had to be solved. Vox decided to make things simple.

|The Ballroom. A name like that might evoke the image of a fancy room filled with royalty, dancing with partners to piano music from long ago. Vox's Ballroom wasn't quite what one would imagine.

The Ballroom was a single room of a rectangular shape. This room, despite its inaccessibility, was easily as massive as a sporting stadium|This room's existence is there for the sole purpose for allowing Vox to shove shit up his ass in private
|Vox knew that he had done cruel, terrible, unforgivable things and he was not going to deny that. These people had come with the hope of seeing good triumph over evil. Yet it was not their kingdom. Instead of helping the poor, the hungry and the forgotten, they had chosen to go on a crusade. They were interfering in another's kingdom, trying to tell someone else how to run their world.|[[Fantasy|Basically, the world works because his mind has direct control over it]]
|The taur looked worried. "Most of them have already faded into the afterlife. Oh...oh my god...he hunted children. He hunted children because they were harder to catch..." There was terror in his voice. He knew Percius was two-faced, but hunting children out of the public eye was far beyond what Vox thought him capable of.|Eating kids is a noble thing if you're Vox. [[Fact|Otherwise, you're a piece of shit.]]
|Vox shook his head. "Relax, Sparky. I wouldn't dare hurt these three. They are not prey of my city and are the unfortunate victims of a false hero. I've tucked them away deep within me. They're curled up within my essence, snuggled safe and sound." He smiled warmly, making Sparky and Damien smile as well. The taur then let out a soft 'Uuurp.' He'd laugh. "Sorry, that was Percius' soul. Rather sour for my taste but it had to be done."|[[Lolwut|Benevolence: It's only evil when Vox doesn't do it.]]

==He will attack you publicly and privately if you don't rp the way he tells you to==
What the hell do [[suethor]]s, a serious critic, and a person who just wants some errors fixed so he can [[fap]] properly? They all disagree with Vox's Posse! Depending on which category you fall into, Vox's Posse will treat you in three different ways, each with a clear example:
#He will keep your comments unhidden and laugh at you behind his computer screen, since you actually think Vox is a character.
#He will call you a troll, if you don't remember every detail from stories about watching paint dry if you're a critic.
#Even if you're a fan of his works, he'll delete your comment if you find many faults in it because [[No|fans must love everything]].
===Battle of the Suethors===
Nothing can rip your eyes, ears, or any other sensory organs out than a Suethor screaming about how powerful his/her/its character is. When you take two Suethors and combine it with the faggotry from [[voraphile]]s and [[furfag]]s, the level of stupidity is astounding. Generationslayer, whom already got into another [[No one cares|nerd fight]] with another equally retarded tartlet, just had to run into the all-powerful Vox as his new sparring mate. Fortunately for us, and unfortunately for them, they just couldn't decide who has the bigger, meaner, nicer [[self-insert]], as seen below.
{{bigpic|Loreit vox power comparison.png|1000|300|
[[shit_no_one_cares_about|Nerd fights,]] it's not like they're ''completely'' pointless.}}

Unlike Generationslayer, Vox's Posse is [[Butthurt|incapable of forgiving you]] if you EVER try to say that you're better than him. Or his character. [[USI|It just isn't possible.]] (See picture 2)

===You can't remember my stories? [[Troll]], I say!===
[[Image:Voxandpersonambigfullchat.png|thumb|The full log, for your viewing pleasure.]]
A little more recently, a person decided to ask Vox various questions in detail about his story and the various pitfalls that even a horny reader would notice if s/he wasn't a furry. Some of the highlights from their conversation are here, where Vox reveals several disturbing things in his mentality and his stories:

{{Bigtext|xionzappa: Heh, I'm sorry that you feel that way. Plenty of people have told me otherwise and, in fact, requested more of him. I have an odd feeling that you dislike fatal vore...

A: No weak physically or mentally, just kind of weak as a personality. Something almost unmemorable.

xionzappa: Philosophical? *Chuckles* None of this is meant to be philosophical. You seem to be implying that I'm trying to make a 'point' with my stories. Not at all. I simply made a world. A world, yes, without sympathy. *Shrugs* A world where the food chain is applied to sentient beings. I don't want you to 'agree' with Vox. He's just there for you to watch.

A: In other words, "Porn star"


A: You mean if Vox were a normal guy, not a taur, not a furry, not even a vorish pred, would people still like him?

xionzappa: And...you're not offering any sort of 'advice'. You're just saying 'This is bad! Fix it! >8{' And yes, I like to think so. :3 Such duality in him that I love. He sees the world in such black and white. "Things to protect and things to use."

xionzappa: It's why a lot of people have told me they prefer him to other preds. They could have a story with anyone and they choose Vox.

xionzappa: Answer my questions above. Why does Vox protect, from what you've read? Also, you disliked all my stories, even the ones not in Epsilon?


A: But let me get back on topic. I think you think Vox protects things because they're useful to him. But that alone doesn't imply duality. To be able to use something, it has to exist.

A: Thus, logically, you protect those tools you plan to use again. It's not duality, it's logic.

xionzappa: ...Okay, that alone proves to me that you didn't read the stories very closely. What of Damien and Ein then?


xionzappa: And I hardly want critique from someone who doesn't remember the details of what they're critiquing. That's a troll.|800|400}}

'''[[tl;dr|Some main points from that conversation:]]'''
*He admits that Vox is basically wallpaper in his world, and then says [[camwhore|the stories are about watching Vox.]]
*He thinks protecting your tools only so that you can use them later is [[lolwut|duality]]. 
*He says he knows the other person hadn't read his stories because [[truth|there's no logic in them.]]
*He believes trolls are people who don't remember his stories, even though his stories are about a guy he admits to being basically as interesting as paint drying.

=== Interview with a [[Pedobear|Pedophile]] ===

*Well, either way, we found the [[CP|child porn]] in your photobucket
*That's all. Baiz

*...Erm...okay?

'''A 6:47 pm'''
*Yeah. Just thought I'd inform you of that.

'''Vox’s Posse:  6:47 pm'''
*You found the child porn [[fap|'drawings']]. Nice to know.

'''A 6:48 pm'''
*Yeah, nothing [[Party_van|legal]] that can be done about it no.
*I just thought I'd tell you you're a [[Voraphilia|sick human being]].

*<Snerk> Molester? You seem to be blurring the lines of fantasy and reality.

'''A 6:49 pm'''
*Or.

'''Vox’s Posse:  6:49 pm'''
*...Or?

'''A 6:49 pm'''
*Or, it's reality.

'''Vox’s Posse:  6:50 pm'''
*Ah. [[truth|'He has drawings of it, he must do it in real life'.]] Nice to know. I'll be sure to tell everyone who's drawn someone shooting someone that they're a [[K/|murderer]]. Anyway, [[butt_hurt|I'm done talking to you.]] Our conversations never seem to go well.

'''A 6:51 pm'''
*Well, actually the quote above shows a general leaning towards "Fantasizes about molesting children."

'''Vox’s Posse:  6:52 pm'''
*Once again, not talking to you. Our conversations never go well and you don't like to listen.

'''A 6:52 pm'''
*Oh no, I love to listen.
*You have this uncanny ability to twist your tongue.
*Last time it was like a pretzel.
*You want a picture?
*It looks kind of like that kid.
*The one in the picture.
*You know, the one you fantasize about molesting?
*Over and over... all sorts of positions.
*Till you both get sweaty.

'''A 6:54 pm'''
*Yeah, I know about those too.

By blocking like a [[13 year old girl]], Vox's Posse admitted to [[pedophilia]], on levels comparable with both [[MJ|Micheal Jackson]] and [[Pedobear]]. The [[pedo]] says that [[no|as long as it's imaginary, it's not wrong,]] and refers to more pictures than the one we [[fap|found]]. In conclusion, Vox's Posse is a [[fetish|sick]] little [[gay|hussy]] who wants to [[dildo|plug his ass]] with kids.

===[[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|OMFG DELETE EVERYTHUNG!]]===
A fellow voraphile attempted to give honest critique to Vox's Posse, hoping he would fix errors so obvious it prevented the reviewer from masturbating. Before reading the original review, you may want to skim [http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=172760#c297482 the story where the review used to be.]
The original review, which was deleted by Vox's Posse, is right here:
<span class="co;[Collapse];[Expand];0;test1"></span>
<div class="test1">
I've read some of your work, particularly the Epsilon stories, and formed a general review of them. I'm not sure where to post this, but I guess I'll post here, the first story I read from you. 

Now, while your narration provides a solid view of what the reader sees, your content is lacking. And when I say lacking, that is an understatement. Here's why:

*Information dump at the beginning: You're guilty of it. This treats the readers as if they are stupid. It is better for them to "explore" the world by having bits of info being released to them, giving them a stronger emotional hook to bite.

*The society structure: Is way out of balance. If you're aiming for the prey to be extinct, go for it! Keep it that way! But at that rate, the preds would die since they can't seem to consume normal food. The prey should be very capable of fighting back since they do all the hard work, while the preds are only in the "prestigious" positions: positions that involve sitting. Also, is Law 29 needed? Your stories already describe them as helpless, and even if the prey were helpless, the preds would still go extinct due to their lack of self-discipline (this is very similar to the spending habits of Americans in the 1920s, which eventually pushed them into the Great Depression). It's implied that the predators do not need to eat to live because when they eat, they get fat. Fat is formed on creatures when they have extra energy they cannot expend. 
Recommended history examples to help:

**Due to the amount of corruption, you may want to examine the Industrial Age for good examples of this. 
**You may also want to study Marxism too, since the governmental policies seem akin to this.
**Also, consider examining the citizens when the Prohibition was still around: people in Epsilon shouldn't be trusting the government if it's run by predators, let alone a day-care.
**1920s, as already stated previously

*The character design: Obviously shows that it is your wish fulfilment mechanism. For one, all of your predators have the ability to digest souls for no reason. Vox gets to rule with an iron fist with no one opposing him, even though the prey items do have a chance (see item 2). Dizzy is an suck-up solely made for Vox, and it's in a typical role: a girlfriend. Your characters can reform prey, but due to your preferences, it rarely ever happens. Not to mention, the villains seem sadistic for the same reasons (which could bore the reader). Either strip that power or actually implement it. Also, your characters are far too based on your personal life (see Damien or Sparky). This is a mistake amateur and/or beginning writers make a lot.

Recommendations:
**Get out more. Girls don't mindlessly praise their boyfriends.
**Don't make too many characters that are based off of your personal preferences or life in great quantity. I honestly wouldn't mind if there were one or two, but there's about 10 or so.
**Remove Vox's ability to alter reality and replace it with something else or make it actually backfire. What's the point of ruling over anything when he has as much power as that?
***Altering reality should actually not work due how it works (given the information in the story):
http://aryion.com/g3/showitem.php?id=174834 <-- Your first comment in there, particularly this sentence: He can control the reality of his being. Notice the his part of it. That would imply he could only alter the reality of himself, but that's another story. Anyway, this "box" isn't just in three dimensions, but would also have to extend to time since it has to encompass all of his being (the fourth being time). Any sudden change in reality might cause this "box" to break or collapse. So if you thought "I must make myself bigger fast" and used this method to grow, you'd break this "box" instantly.
***Consequent  [Too much, even if it worked properly!]: If Vox abuses his power too much (which he does, due to the stories you write), his body should've mutated beyond belief and he should NOT be able to perceive reality normally, like others do.
**See the era recommendations for making your characters more believable.

*The world residents: Do not make sense. Near the beginning, you state this:
<snip about Sparky> Even if they had, he was such a small meal that they likely would have left him be.
^If that's the case, wouldn't the prey class citizens end up being his size at this rate? Since the preds prefer bigger meals? And what are Pokemon doing here?  I honestly can't see why or how Pokemon got in here or play a crucial part in your stories.
Also, another case of world residents not making sense:
Unless Sparky got one very angry, he knew he didn't need to worry. Unfortunately for him, the defense mechanism that most pikachus could rely on, their low current of electricity, didn't seem to work in Epsilon. 
^Stop raping Pokemon. Pikachus, Raichus, and Pichus...ANY Pokemon can kill them if they output enough electricity...unless Sparky's a baby...meaning he's a Pichu. But he's not. See item 2 for more about society.

If this non-offensive review met all the criteria for the "[[BLANKING_IN_PROGRESS|Vox's Posse Cleanup]]," it makes you wonder [[Over 9000|how many]] similar comments got deleted. No wonder why there's a dearth of comments on the fap material: it's just that horrible.

====[[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|''OMFG DELETE EVERYTHUNG!'': The Sequel]]====
Upon discovering his article, he registered under the name [[User:Xionzappa|Xionzappa]] and [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|deleted fucking everything.]] Of course, this isn't just out of [[butthurt]]: it's just [[USI|him controlling his insignificant speck of the universe]]. In fact, his [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Vox%27s_Posse&diff=1998424500&oldid=1998424494 edits] to his article prove his journal to be correct on a far more sad scale:
{{quote|1=I'm not too fond of doing battles and such. Too attached to my chars and not fond of stories I don't control.|2=Vox's Posse|3=[http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1215118/ FA journal], [[Typical|proving he cares more about his imagination than other furfags]]}}
This thoroughly explains his recent remarks to one of his friends:
{{quote|1=(12:49:01 PM) xionzappa: Tell me if there's any way I can help. :3 As I said, I want you to do well as a writer. And, as always, feel free to ignore my criticisms.

If you really want to know to more about what Vox's Posse felt from the usual butthurt, here's the [[furfag]]'s reasons.
{{morphquote|mqtest2|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;
|(12:01:06 PM) xionzappa: *Nod nods* I'd say, though I dun exactly want to discuss it. Not terribly fond of that article, you see.

(12:02:02 PM) xionzappa: Point is, that's on a website that bashes furries all the time. x3 Take it all with a few large grains of salt.|Vox's Posse, [[Lie|not caring about his article]]
|(03:51:33 PM) xionzappa: Cause everything's so misquoted and poorly done. x3

Furfag is a common nickname, considering many of the pictures of the furry communities involve gay canines humping eachother.|Vox's Posse, [[Lies|pretending furfag doesn't offend him]]}}

==Joining the Fanclub==
Vox is a very picky [[roleplay|roleplayer]], and therefore restricts himself to [[elitist|a small circle of extremely verbose, loyal friends]]. However, even the [[White Knight|most verbose and loyal]] aren't guaranteed his eternal [[rape|friendship]]. The only people to whom Vox's friendship is guaranteed are [[Bawww|the moderators he can come crawling to whenever someone criticizes him]] and [[fanart|any artist who is willing to draw free pictures of his characters on demand]]. In fact, though he claims to keep [[elitist|very high standards]] with the people who he is willing to roleplay with, he will [[hypocrite|make an exception]] for anyone who falls into the previous two categories; artists, admins and [[moderators]]. Furthermore, even the most literate and loyal friends he has are liable to be tossed aside as soon as he grows bored with them, unless they serve one of the two aforementioned [[buttsex|purposes]]. Yes, even the ones who are [[pedophile|ready and willing to play a group of frightened, crying children for Vox to shove up his self-righteous ass]].
