The Singing Shark
[[Image:Imasharkww3.jpg|center]]

The Singing Shark is an internet comic as old as the internet, depicting a shark singing (obviously). It originated in 2008 on the webcomic "The Hockey Zombie" when the artist Chris VanGompel wanted to do a week long tribute of shark comics for Discovery Channel's Shark Week.  

There are about 25 original Singing Shark comics, plus uncountable online variations.
