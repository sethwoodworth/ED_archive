Phaedriel
[[Image:Waddaskank.jpg|frame|right|Pure fuck meat. She would have really made herself a career in porno.]]

'''Phaedriel''' aka [http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/hivemind.html#299 Sharon Kershee Tahsequah] is a little [[emo]] injun whore who spends every minute of her small life at the [[Wikipedia]] cesspool. This [[admin]] wannabe enjoys writing long tearful essays and emotionally charged messages with no purpose besides stirring up the libidos of nerdy basement dwelling teenage boys like [[Sceptre]] and Matthew Fenton. She is also a protégé of [[MONGO]] and she will go any distance to kiss his ass [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMONGO&diff=64167196&oldid=64165242], though no intercourse could ever take place between them because of the [[homosexuality]] of the former. Phaedriel relieves her nymphomaniac sexual impulses with long, over the top messages carefully written to make herself look like she cares when all she wants is to call attention. She has never made any real contributions, because her only goal is to make [[at least 100]] wikifucks jerk off with her pics. Editing or "vandalizing" her page will result in a revert within 4 seconds from one of the virgin administrators constantly refreshing her page hoping for a new pic upload. 9 out of 10 wikipedos and wikinazis cannot ejaculate without reverting a page.

She was first nominated for adminship, but declined, a clear sign that she is in fact a chickenshit who doesn't want any real responsibility other than being a full-time [[attention whore]].  Then she was nominated again and accepted. She won adminship due to [[hawt]]ness, and her support vote were things like: ''"That's hot, Sharon!"''; ''"I did "That's hot" first!"''; and ''"Support based on her user page's self-portrait alone."'' This proves once again that [[Wikipedo]]s think with their [[dick]]s.

She is a [[wiccan]] in [http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:8eUS-cknCk4J:www.icq.com/groups/members.php%3Fgid%3D36714+%22Sharon+Kershee+Tahsequah%22&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1 The Silver Moon Coven] and possibly an [[otherkin]]. As she is practicing evil magic, [[Fact|she is going to Hell where she will suck Satan's cock for eternity.]]

==Hawtest Wikipedo eva==

[[Image:Phaefuck3.jpg|thumb|right|Phaedriel's birthday wish list.]]
Despite drinking too much of the [[Kool-Aid]], she is actually [[hawt]].  This makes no sense.  Could she be a [[Kelly Martin|shemale]]? [[Srsly]], [[secks|I'd hit it]], dude...

* She is not hawt - she is a skinny ana. Srsly: it'd be like poking a bicycle frame.

==Knocked up==

[[Image:Anal Penetration.gif|thumb|right|How she became administrator at Wikipedia.]]
Apparently, she had too much hardcore wikisex (one [[bureaucratic fuck]] too many), and it finally caught up to her. She has not revealed the identity of the father, because she can't tell who of all the wikisucks she got laid with at Wiki-fukin-mania may be. Wikipedos went zOMG [[idiot|how fukin' sweet!]], but srsly, they didn't give a shit. All they wanted was her to [[abortion|abort]] just to keep bangin' and knocking her up over and over.

==Miss Carriage==

[[Image:Indianslutz.jpg|thumb|right|Phaedriel taking part in a Rain Dance with her tribe. Notice the absence of penetration involved and her sexual frustration.]]
[[Image:Bitches-phaedriel.jpg|thumb|Wikipedians don't know what happened yet.]]
During her pregnancy, thanks to [[FAS|alcohol abuse]]*, she had a [[miscarriage]] of a [[down syndrome]] fetus baby. [http://ehealthforum.com/health/topic79791.html] Phaedriel got all [[emo]] and feeling [[butthurt]], she vanished for many glorious months. But good things never last foreva. In June 2007, she came back and using either Google images or pictures of a friend's baby and she immediately quelled the rumor with a stock photo of a baby on her userpage. The [[asking for it|love bombing saga]] continues...

== Oh adoring morons, how I love thee ==

*Even Daniel Brandt thinks this little bitch's srlsy fucked up, and dedicated her his best quote eva: 


{{quote|It might be time to compile a list of gushy love-bombing messages from Phaedriel to minors at Wikipedia. This behavior by her is inappropriate.|Daniel Brandt}}

{{quote|In the last days, and for reasons that don't matter here and now, I was feeling very down; it happens sometimes, none of us is above that. I never wanna paly victim in those circumstances; I'm just an ordinary person with ordinary problems, nothing more. I just wanted everyone who visited me to know why I wasn't in the talktative mood I usually am, and to explain why my replies were scanty. The least I expected was the incredible message you sent me, and all the wonderful effort you put in cheering me up... and most important, how you succeeded in your endeavour. the way your words and comfort seemed to stem from the very screen felt like an embrace, and I had re read it many times, and listened to the beautiful music you shared with me... I have no words to describe it. And you did all that for ''me'', a complete stranger... I'll never forget this, my dear Skookum, ever.|Tha bitch herself}}

{{quote|We all love you, Kylu, because we see the great goodness in you, and your incredible will to help and work hard. Please, remember that if your faith ever fades away again. With a great, BIG hug, your friend now and always.|Yours truly, tha Wikislut}}

On Valentine's Day of 2006, Sharon wrote a long-winded post about how Wikipedia is her substitute for a boyfriend. The very fact that she went to Wikipedia to write a huge journal on Valentine's Day is only further evidence of how very lonely she is-- which is strange because she looks like pure fuck-meat. The reason for this post was a reply to a comment she heard (probably from this encyclopædia) that '''"Wikipedia is not a place for happy people,"''' lulz. The rest of her journal had the thoughtful insight of a [[16-year-old girl]], going on about human nature and shit like that.
{{quote|I may be down, but I'm not dead - and my heart's alive and well, and I won't let it bleed for long. I do not take the Internet so seriously as to make me cry...|Phae-fuck-meat-driel}}
She puts on the persona of a strong-willed individual in this message, which isn't just lulzy in itself, because if anyone's reduced her to tears, its our lovely encyclopædia. The rest of the message is mostly just more pretentious Wikipedia-humping shit.

==Phaedriel caught in a lie==
She has said for a long time on her userpage, "Since I joined Wikipedia a couple of months ago, I must tell that never, ever, I've felt diminished nor discriminated in any way by another user."

*What about all the vandals and trolls who have put sexist and racist remarks out there?
*What about all the vandals and trolls who have went around saying "LOL Phaedriel miscarried" on Wikipedia?

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_EndoExo EndoExo,] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Mike_Garcia Mike Garcia],

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_CIyde CIyde],
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Gorge_He George He], and [[Amorrow]].  They all did this crap to her. Poor Sharon.

Then others claimed she had a bad influence on children and was the one who convinced [[Nathanr]] to give into the constant flirting and seduction from a 15 year old internet slut even though Nathan didn't really want to.  Moreover, Daniel Brandt even said, ''[http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=3110&pid=13318&st=0&# "It might be time to compile a list of gushy love-bombing messages from Phaedriel to minors at Wikipedia. This behavior by her is inappropriate."]

Okay now, everyone, can you imagine if Phaedriel wasn't a hot woman, but instead a man doing all that love-bombing? He'd be instantly be branded as a pederast.

If she's never felt diminished nor discriminated against, then why is she always going on long wikibreaks to get away from all the attention she gets?  She's an attention whore, so it's not likely that she leaves because the positive attention is too hard to handle.

Which would explain why they love to come here and vandalize the fuck out of everything.
