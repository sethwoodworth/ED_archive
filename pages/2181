Deluge
{{boring}}

'''Deluge''' is the [[open source]] equivalent of [[uTorrent]]... which is free anyway. Like every other [[BitTorrent]] client, it can be used to download [[Adobe Photoshop]] and huge amounts of [[pr0n]] quickly and illegally.


==Technical Shit==
Just like every other [[Linux]]-based program, Deluge prides itself on a bunch of fancy words and things that make the user feel totally [[l33t]]. Examples, quoted straight from the [http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/About horse's ass]:
*Uses libtorrent in it's backend. ([[your mom]] is similar in this regard)
*Client server model with a daemon process. ([[WTF]] is this, I don't even...)
*Features multiple user-interfaces including: GTK+, web and console. (To make it seem like you're doing something that definitely isn't [[CP]])
*Will work just fine in GNOME, KDE, XFCE. (Linux, Linux, and Linux)


==But it's OPEN SOURCE!!!!!!1==
{{unwelcome}}
[[Srsly]] though, because the program is open source, any [[l33t]] [[hacker]] can download the super secret code and modify it. So even [[you]] can... you know... change it.

'''Possible Modifications'''
*Maybe put some fuckin... like... your name or some shit on there.
*Put a picture of dicks or something.
*OMG let's make it set [[Lemonparty]] as the background LOLROFL
*[[????]]
