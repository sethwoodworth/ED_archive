GodTube
[[Image:Godtube lol.jpg|thumb|right|'''SUP /i/'''?!]]
'''[http://godtube.com/ GodTube]''' <s>is</s> was a free video sharing website that was [[asking for it]]. GodTube.com was basically the trollers' gift that kept on giving. Much like [[JewTube]], but which specialized in Christian-themed videos which [[Blu Aardvark]] is "so down for". In particular, GodTube has been compared to [[Conservapedia]], a Christian conservative encyclopedia opposed to [[Wikipedia]], and '''[[MyChurch]]''' (LOL), a Christian version of [[MySpace]].

GodTube was founded by some god-fearing [[cunt]], Chris Wyatt, who is currently a student at Dallas Theological Seminary. Word on the street is Chris Wyatt was formerly a TV producer for CBS show Kid Nation. GodTube was privately funded by investors, and dumbfucks who think evolution shouldn't be taught in schools.

==Controversy==

Christian Russ Seehafer posted a video criticizing the site as founded on hubris and theological arrogance saying that "It is beyond me how anyone can claim to be so down with our maker that they are able to slap his approval on anything they deem 'christian'." The video appeared on the front page of the site and was subsequently removed. It was then reinstated with a comment from GodTube's CEO.

It is also notable that supposedly [[VioletKitty|VK411]] was hiding out somewhere on the site.


A question that some of these god fearing fucks will never answer is, where is your Jesus while your priests are raping little boys? 'Jesus saves'? Tell that to the little boys who were [[ass]][[raped]] in Church. But hey, as long as it's in the name of the [[God]], It's [[awwright]]!

==Broadcast Him Invasion==
Various [[Anonymous]] groups (such as 420niggertits) were alerted  to the existence of GodTube, and finally someone dropped [[LSD]] here [http://www.not420chan.com/i/res/90890.html#i90890].

===The Invasion Begins===
<pre>
GodTube's site search, which could be used to find videos, groups,
and users, did not correctly sanitize its input. The problem however 
is using normal ASCII characters inside of any quote (single, or double)
would cause the page to output a script error, which would keep the 
vulnerability's payload from executing. In this example I converted:

'location.href="http://www.awesomeandrew.net/"'
into its decimal equivalent 
for each character in the string, and then had it evaluated inside of 
the String.fromCharCode function to help it execute. Therefore when 
using this example in vulnerable URL you'll force an instant redirection 
to a new location.

A similar vulnerability was found within the login page, which 
was accessible whether the user is logged out, or currently 
logged in. The above example simply alerts the user with their 
cookie data (if the cookie exists), but could obviously be used 
for much greater, or malicious purposes such as phishing, stealing
cookie data, altering user information, installing third-party 
malware, or just about anything else that's possible using a computer.
The input goes unsanitized again, but using quotes with ASCII characters
inside will cause a script error again so String.fromCharCode must
be used when quotes are required.

Another vulnerability, just like the other reflective cross-site 
scripting holes I've already found, but inside the user signup page.
In this instance however I forego the String.fromCharCode, and use 
the eval function to evaluate statements made after the URL's fragment
identifier (the hash symbol, or "#"). Using the script placed within 
the vulnerable area an evaluation is made on the data following the URL,
which is then executed as the payload. As with an cross-site scripting 
vulnerability this can be used for an array of purposes.
