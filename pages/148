AMX Mod X
[[Image:Twistylogo.jpg|frame|Quality content must surely abound within]]
[http://www.amxmodx.org/forums/ AMX Mod X] is a web site that includes a [[forum]] on which [[Twilight Suzuka]] is no longer a dev.

AMX Mod X is also an extended scripting language for Half Life, the game that was released in 1998, an entire millennium ago, paving the way for Wolfenstein and Pokemon Snapshot. Much like [[basement-dweller|other refined gamers]] the good people of AMX are caught up in the past, where the [[Nintendo|Nintendo Entertainment System]] is the only thing that the truly cool kids are playing.

However the AMX community cannot quite relinquish the experience that a FPS offers, namely letting the player pretend they have a [[gun]] and can get away with using it frequently. Hence their persistence in continuing to support and develop the oldest role-playing game released on the PC, Half Life.

[http://www.amxmodx.org/forums/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=2331 Twilight Suzuka] looks something like Mimi from the [http://imdb.com/title/tt0111945/ Drew Carey Show]. It was never a [[dev]] of [[AMX Mod X]], it only created various worthless modules. It eats nothing but penguins and knows Gabe Newell (aka "Gaben") personally.
