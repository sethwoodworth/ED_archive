'''Inara BBS''' is the latest in a series of many spinoff [[BBS|boards]] from [[ISCABBS]].  That's right.  In 2006, drama on a text-based [[telnet]] [[Citadel]] led to a split ''25 years'' after original Citadel was first created.

The main goal of Inara BBS is to separate the [[tard]]s from the [[bureaucratic fuck]]s of the Citadel world: Inara gets all the "special" [[lusers]] and ISCA keeps all the [[Nazi]]s plus notable BBS [[pussy]] Bearwalker.

And so it begins (NB, this guy is the sysop):

==Camwhore Drama==
The room called BexLikesGunsButtsBoobs> on Inara is dedicated to sharing pictures of [[guns]] and [[ass]] on a sekrit [[Flickr]] account which is invite-only.

A sample of the room's charter:

 Ok this is the fun part.  Each week I will post a new body shot and firearm of
 the     week.  I am taking pictures of body parts:  male and female, clothed in
 undies or nude.  They can be crotch shots, boobs shots, butt shots, whatever.
 If it's hot, it's in.

A user named [[User:Cernorama|Cernorama]], driven to a fit of apoplectic rage by the inferior quality Midwestern [[fat girl angle shot]]s dominating the photo stream, mirrored the pictures and posted the [[Yahoo]] IDs of all participating camwhores to a sex-wanted group, leading those users to be [[crapflood]]ed by hundreds of desperate males.

Cernorama used [[Tainted Love]]'s yahoo account to post the camspam bait.  Both were later [[twit]]ted, Tainted Love after she attempted to explain that Cernorama was "striking back the only way he can" after "50 users ganged up on him."

Then, because the admin hadn't figured out how to [[perma-ban|IP block]] people and because twits can still read messages on Inara, [[at least 100]] users with a [[ops|roomaideship]] ganged up on Cernorama and kicked him out of their rooms.  They posted happily about their progress while doing so.  It was like a picnic.

The next day, Inara was [[Denial of Service|DOSed]] from a single IP and [[Howard Beale]] decided it might be a good time to learn iptables.
