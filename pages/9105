Wisconsin (or as the locals call it, WisCAAAAANsin) is a huge shithole in the [[Illinois|Midwest]]. The birthplace of the [[Republican]] Party, [[nazi|Senator Joe McCarthy]] and [[nazi|The John Birch Society]].  In other words, Wisconsin is essentially [[Texas]] with eight months of winter.  It houses [[fact|73% of the country's fat people]], [[redneck]]s and [[alcoholic]]s. 


The typical Wisconsin resident is a truck driver who owns a farm and is married to a cow. In fact, if you look at a satellite photograph of Wisconsin, you will see lots of green from the state's massive amount of corn and John Deere tractors.

If you are lucky enough to stumble upon an inhabited location in Wisconsin, you will find [[over 9000]] Indian casinos, bars, and liquor stores. There are no houses in these cities because everyone lives in underground retirement homes.

If you are ever challenged to a drinking contest by someone from Wisconsin, don't.

== History ==

[[At least 100]] years ago, some [[French]] guy named [[Star Trek|Jean Luc-Picard]] became Wisconsin's first Space captain, landing in a cornfield near modern-day Corn Bay in search of [[cp|child pornography]]. Sadly, all he found were [[Native_Americans|red people]] and corn.

After the Revolution, Wisconsin was part of the U.S. Useless Territory. It was then governed as part of [[AIDS]] Ranch, [[Faggot]] dump, and [[Michigan]]. Settlement began when the first two public [[eBay]] offices opened.

The state STD is AIDS (aka [[faggot]] disease), which reflects Wisconsin's early sexual history. Many town names such as AIDS Point recall a period [[at least 100 years ago]] when Wisconsin was an important sexual concentration camp.

After all of this faggotry occurred, larger numbers of [[Jews]] arrived, and the state subsequently became over one-third Ash. Most became small business owners, especially known for their nick knack shops and dildo emporiums. Others moved to Milwaukee to find employment and make their usual profit from the city's high concentration of gullible [[nigra]]s.

The official [[sheep|religion]] of 'Scaaaaansin is based on the American't [[handegg|football]] team, The Green Bay (fudge)Packers. Worship of these [[fag|athletes]] is regarded as [[serious business]], and the indoctrination of children to this mindless [[NORP]] faith is common.

In 1836, Wisconsin became the undeclared loser of the [[Toledo]] War of 1835, a dispute that it wasn't even a part of. This says a lot about Wisconsin.

== Geography ==

The landscape of Wisconsin was formed by the movement of glaciers during the ice age. These glaciers changed the land by carving out bluffs and depositing soil to form Wisconsin's trademark hills. Unfortunately, these glaciers occurred thousands of years ago when civilization did not exist. So instead of rightfully destroying Wisconsin and all of its backwards [[white trash]] inhabitants, it turned the area into an outdoors haven for hicks throughout the Midwest who can't afford a real vacation.

Fortunately, there is still hope. Wisconsin shares borders with two of the Great Lakes. If [[global warming]] - the only remaining political tool of dirty, [[Madison|pot-smoking]] [[hippies]] - does exist, it will cause these lakes to flood most of Wisconsin, turning the land into a boiling stew of cheese, beer, bratwurst, flannel jackets, 80s rock cassettes and the [[Dutch]].

== Wisconsin Cities ==
'''Milwaukee:''' Allegedly Wisconsin's largest city.  Supposedly a place that despite being within Wisconsin's borders has a people population that [[over 9000|far outnumbers]] the cows including heavy concentrations of [[nigras]], Mexicans and [[hipsters]] as well as miles of running and biking trails, and a huge [[fag|art museum]].  However, because [[redneck|Wisconsin people]] are afraid of all of these things, no one has ever actually gone to Milwaukee to see if it really exists.  It is widely suspected that Milwaukee was created by the media for news stories about black person and as a setting for lame nostalgic sitcoms.  An alternate theory states that Milwaukee did exist at one point, but that [[Sick fuck|Jeffrey Dahmer]] ate the entire population between 1978 and 1991.

'''Madison:''' Wisconsin's [[dirty|communist]] [[hippy]] hatchery.  Takes pride in being the "Berkeley of the Midwest" without regard for the fact that it's just like every other fucking college town in existence and that being like Berkeley is nothing to be proud of.  Madisonians like to think they live in such a unique and intellectual city for being [[communist|green]], tolerant of [[fags]], and believing in [[liberal]] policies.  But they're really just unaware of how low the bar is set in a state where Green Acres and Hee Haw are considered cultural programming.  The University of Wisconsin now admits more students from the east coast than from in-state as part of an ongoing 30-year plan to completely eliminate having to deal with people from Wisconsin by the year 2025.

'''Green Bay:''' What you would get if [[Redneck|Larry The Cable Guy]] designed a city that was granted an NFL franchise.  Prides itself on its "family friendly" environment despite the fact that domestic violence [[True|doubles on days when the Packers lose]] and the majority of kids who grow up here become meth-addicts who work at Wal-Mart or sit home and collect disability checks.  No one in Green Bay has any aspirations beyond [[Hunting|killing animals]] and [[alcoholic|attending the next $10 all-you-can-drink night]].  They used to take pride in the Packers when they were led by the local [[Redneck|wrangler-wearing]], smaller-dicked version of [[Jesus]] known as [[Douchebag|Brett Favre]], but even he decided in 2008 that he could no longer stand to live around these freaks and the already astronomical local suicide rate went up accordingly.

'''Appleton:''' Exactly like Green Bay, but without a football team.  Also responsible for producing [[nazi|Senator Joe McCarthy]].

'''Lake Geneva and Door County:''' Elaborate tourist traps whose economies are dependent upon marginally-successful Chicago businessmen who can't afford to vacation somewhere that people actually want to go.  The average vacationer in one of these places thinks "roughing it" means sleeping in a $30,000 camper.
