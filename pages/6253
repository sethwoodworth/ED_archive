A '''paper trail''' is a way in which [[Jews|bureaucrats]] and researchers used to track people and things before the internet was invented [[IRL]]. Paper trails provide the best kind of [[lies|proof]] (written) for one's arguments and because of this they are still used today. Scholars often [[Bullshit|utilize]] paper trails to come up with proof for their [[shit|theories]].

==How to prove a point with a paper trail==
# Locate [[Islam|something]] which you disagree agree with.
# Inform everyone you know that this thing is a [[lie]].
# Go to a library, museum or archive; locating the appropriate documents, preferably ones which are [[tl;dr|extremely technical and hard to understand]]. In a pinch, one may create fake, tea-stained or sandworn scrolls and tomes instead.
# Cite said documents thoroughly; remember, people being lazy, the more you cite, the less likely anyone is to call you on your bullshit.
# [[????]]
# [[W|Profit!]]
