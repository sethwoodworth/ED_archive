Moon Man
'''Moon Man''' is a [[YTMND]] [[meme]] stirring up [[epic]] [[lulz]]. Created [[last Thursday]] using [[gif]]s of an [[80s]] [[McDonald's]] [[TV]] mascot, he/it started off a rather innocent fad, but user Farkle brought him to fame by [[trolling]] black persons with blatantly [[racist]] statements/threats of [[violence]] (most often chanting [[KKK|"K-K-'''''K!'''''"]]) using a [[soi|text-to-speech program]]. [[Some argue|They say]] it's his nonchalant delivery that [[win|drives it home]]. More recently, however, he has been utilized through [[YouTube]] by [[Anonymous]] in their battle against [[Scientology]], as well as informing [[Chanology]]'s [[newfag]]s how they are [[doing it wrong]].

Recently, AT&T b& users from making moon man audio clips by adding a list of censored words. [http://public.research.att.com/~ttsweb/tts/demo.php Trying to make a voice-to-text file that contains the words "Moon Man" will get you this warning].
