'''YouTube''' (sometimes called '''[[Jewtube]]''') is a place where every illiterate [[fucktard]] on the [[internet]] converges. It is also a [[crap]]py video site, which is just as bad as Break.com in all manners of fugly girls posing, [[noobs]], drag queens posing, [[fantards]], clips from [[gay]] [[animu|animes]], [[old meme]]s, and [[goth]]/[[emo]] videos.  Practically everything in the "[[attention whore|most viewed]]" and "[[honorz|top rated]]" categories are either softcore [[Operation YouTube|porn]], clips from [[Family Guy|shit tv shows]] or sporting events, [[YouTube Poop]], [[weeaboo]] [[anime|faggotry]], politically incendiary crap, horny [[azn|azns]], stupid pet tricks, [[niggers|Soulja Boy]], [[men]] measuring their manboobs [[lie|(HOT!)]], and let us not forget [[loli|underage girls]] shaking their asses on camera, and [[shit|everything else]]. YouTube is pure [[drama]], the entire [[UGC|user base]] being full of [[emo|overly-emotional]] morons who will [[BAWWWWW|whine]], bitch, and moan at the slightest [[troll|provocation]]. So much as a drawn [[mspaint|picture]] of another user with the words "poopy head" on it will instantly cause a shit storm. YouTube's most loyal viewers include [[Juggalos]], [[emos]], and [[Jews]]. It is also wise to note that the YouTube fags find [[sarcasm]] to be scary and difficult for their [[13-year-old boy|underdeveloped]] brains to understand, so it is generally advisable (unless you are [[trolling]] the [[fucktards]]) not to use sarcasm as, like [[irony]], it will cause a shitstorm within their mentally [[retarded]] heads.

It is important to note that YouTube was named by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' to be the [http://www.time.com/time/2006/techguide/bestinventions/inventions/youtube.html best invention of 2006]. Coming in second was a formula to prevent [[cunt|cervical]] cancer (No, [http://www.time.com/time/2006/techguide/bestinventions/inventions/medicine2.html srsly]). Well, these are the same liberal fuckwits that labeled Finland as the #1 country in the world to live in, despite not providing any real evidence as to why. The [[sick fuck|sick fucks]] probably just like the legalized drugs, underaged girls, and lack of any real economic contributions to the world.

[[Last Thursday]], [[Google]] bought out YouTube and renamed it [[Santorum|Goo]]Tube [[beta]], shortly thereafter the era of [[The Promised Land]] began. And on March 31st, the year of [[Satan|Our Lord]] 2010, they have made their beta the [[Rape|inescapable]] face of the site, completely sealing their [[Shit nobody cares about|content]] in a vast cavern of [[fail]]. Nice job shitting where you eat, faggots. [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS]], THEY CHANGED IT BACK.

Unless you're [[butthurt|hurting]] their [[crybaby|e-feelings]], [[retards|YouTube users]] [[fellatio|adore]] absolutely any [[itschriscrocker|wretched shit]] uploaded to their site at all. Many people like to upload [[unfunny|hilarious]] videos of [[retard|themselves]] and [[scenester|their friends]] doing [[Shit nobody cares about|something absolutely crazy]] like a silly dance, putting on a stupid hat, performing some asinine [[self pwn|stunt]] or [[Battletoads|prank]], or making a movie made of sheer faggotry for the internet to enjoy. YouTube is a website which enables every [[lonely]] and desperate [[basement dweller|low life]] to spend endless amounts of time pursuing some shred of [[E-fame]] whilst providing a home for all others to troll them.  It really allows us all to grasp [[THE POWER OF ONLINE VIDEO COMMUNICATION|the power of online video communication]].

YouTube is almost as shitty as [[Yahoo Answers]] in terms of faggotry. However, there is just a little more freedom to flame [[niggers]] due to the fact that [[white people|Hitler doesn't absolutely own the site]]. On YouTube there are the typical emo faggots who QQ about their lives...([http://www.youtube.com/user/TheKittyKiko click here for example]). These fags often end up on forums such as /B/ on 4chan. They are crap.

==[[Typical]] Uses==
[[Image:Efwed.jpg|thumb|left|110px|The YouTubes is [[serious business]]!]]

Beyond finding [[unfunny]] crap to watch and interesting news clips of [[RFJason CL Experiment|internet dramaz]], YouTube can also be used as a tool for queers to shove their [[Chris Crocker|faggotry]] down the throats of [[Palestine|our great nation]]. Now remember... YouTube is basically just a free porn site for people (such as [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Commandothelion CommandoTheLion]) with odd fetishes.  Searching for [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gay+kiss&search=Search "gay kiss"] turns up more videos than you can shake a [[cock]] at. The ultimate [[pwn]]age for [[ghey]]s is when a [[Gay Kiss|gay kiss]] video is taken down, since it gives them the opportunity to flare up and bitch about [[fursecution|homophobia]] on the [[internet]]s.

If you find yourself on a gay blog or MySpace and don't see any embedded [[Gay Kiss|gay kiss]] videos, you may rightfully claim [[winning the internet|2 free internets]] from the site's owner. Don't hold out though, you're much more likely to find a [[straight]] [[furry]] or a [[diabeetus|diabetic]] who doesn't remind you of a [[Shay|rhinoceros]].
 

== Things First Time YouTube Browsers Should Know ==
* You'll never be famous or even create a [[meme]] because the website is now basically a Hulu promo with [[16 year old girl|intermittent retarded 16-year old girls who love Jesus plugging Jenny Craig]].

* Within ten minutes of first clicking that link that brings you to YouTube, you will inevitably find [[Chris Crocker|someone whom you instantly hate with a burning passion]].  As a speciality: <strike>[[Goronchev]]</strike> [[lol]] account [[banhammered]].  There are no exceptions to this rule.

*If you like something, there is a strong possibility that someone is going to call you out on it and call you a _____ american.  Every video that has comments has a comment which contains this "insult", guaranteed.

* If the above rule takes effect and the object of loathing is '''not''' a [[Truther|9/11 conspiracy]] theorist, you are probably not on YouTube. Tell them it was done by pissed off [[Gay| Muslims]] no matter what you think for lulz.

* Yes, they have [[Mystery_Science_Theater_3000|''MST3K'' clips]]. Lots of them. F-YEAH.

* YouTube Users are known to complain about [[lies|false copyright claims]] against them so they can get their [[shit]] videos and accounts back up so YouTube can feel sorry for them and to poke fun at the "[[haters]]" and/or act like a total [[faggot]] for [[at least 100]] videos to get the point across. 

*You will always need to make backup accounts to avoid flagging [[fags|users]] just in case you are a [[troll]].

*YouTube is an endless video war to see who can stroke their e-peen even higher and act like a [[victim]] most of the time. 

*YouTube is Jew.

*It is mandatory for all fagtube videos to have a shitty intro (made with [[Microsoft|Microshit]] movie maker,([[Queer]] ass music included)) that is longer than the video itself.

*Subscribers don't mean a damn thing.  See figure 2 to the right.

*By all means do not post that comment about [[Family Guy]]!!!

==[[Copyright]] Bullshit==
[[Image:YouNoobs.png|thumb|[[Typical]] YouTube drama.]]
[[File:youtuber.jpg|thumb|right|Life cycle of a YouTuber who uploads videos.]]
[[Image:Viacomyoutube.jpg|thumb|right|A billion dollar hissyfit.]]
[[Image:Subscriberfail.PNG|thumb|right|powerful706 has 33413 subscribers and none of them are watching his shit.]]

[[100 years ago]], YouTube was a haven for [[pirates]], who made it totally awesome for us by outweighing the [[camwhore]] shit with almost every [[anime]], [[TV|TV show]] and [[porn]]o movie you could think of.  But then, one day, some [[faggot]] from Viacom whined about [[everyone]] spreading a clip of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' all over the [[internets]] and the shitstorm began.  

As a result, YouTube became [[Nazi]]s and decided to wipe off every piece of [[copyright]]ed material they could find, including those taken with a shitty [[webcam]]. Although few of these remain, millions of [[AMV]]s remained untouched. YouTube also loves to [[pwn]] any account that has hosted these video clips, just [[for the lulz]], but the so-called "offenders" would come back anyway and post their shit again.

===Update:===
YouTube has now implemented an automatic pwning device to take out copyright material. The system functions by identifying code in your uploads. For example if you were to download some other useless video off of YouTube then upload it directly YouTube would reject it automatically. It can also detect other profanities such as severe violence, gore, nudity, and [[Trevor Rieger]].

===Another Update:===
YouTube has implemented a system where, in certain countries, you may or may not be able to view certain videos based on arbitrary legal restrictions. Oh noes, [[Britfag|British]] users can no longer watch music videos, which is total [[win|bullshit]]!!!!!!!!
===But then, how?===
[[PROTIP]]:
* 1. Get the whole address of the video (like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbaTur4A1OU)
* 2. Go to [http://keepvid.com here]
* 3. Paste the address to the textbox
* 4. press OK, then select a link to download, and [[Pirate|download the video]]
* 5. watch it, and laugh at the copyrightfags
* 6. [[????]]
* 7. [[PROFIT!]]

==The [[DMCA]]==
[[Image:Dmca swastika.png|thumb|right]]
YouTube is likely the biggest worldwide hub for [[DMCA]] abuse on the entire internet, as well as home to the endless debate that has resulted from it. Since the site's inception there have been endless [[whaaambulance|diatribes]] concerning DMCA abuse by individuals who are clearly oblivious as to the actual legislation. This is usually because most people on YouTube who fancy themselves "[[USI|vlogger]]s" are [[fugly|un-photogenic]] self-involved highschool dropouts who would rather whine about [[The Man]] than face the reality of their own ignorance.  

If you get a video removed or you get banned by someone filing a false DMCA, here's some clarification for complete and utter [[retards]]:

*Upon receiving a properly formatted take-down notice YouTube will remove content '''regardless'''. Despite common misconceptions of complete idiots, YouTube does not check your [[SNCA|content]] to verify whether it is infringing of others' [[copyright]]s, nor does the site make value judgments on content or whether it is infringing. '''If YouTube did this they would themselves become [[serious business|liable]]'''.  If you have something removed you must either:
#Drop your own [[dox]] in a properly formatted DMCA counter-notice to prove you were right and restore the content. It's pretty fucking easy if you're not a complete [[you|retard]], just click on copyright at the bottom of YouTube and follow the steps.
#Provide a fake DMCA counter-notice anyway. It doesn't matter how much you bullshit, as long as you file any kind of counter-claim then YouTube HAS to put your content back up within two weeks. At that point the only way another party can then have your content removed legally is to pursue their interests in a court of [[Internet Law|IRL law]] in the US or through the international courts. [[PROTIP]] - you are not testifying in court at this point so there's no risk facing [[Party Van|perjury]] charges, you [[pussy|pansy]].
*The DMCA is intended to protect intellectual property - not to remove objectionable content.  This is perhaps the most fundamental misunderstanding of the DMCA - this and complete ignorance of applicability the "Fair Use" clause of The Act.  But because YouTube is, and always will be, inhabited by clueless [[low-life]]s who would rather the site remain a [[hugbox]], there are always those who will be willing to perjure themselves to save their fragile psyche the torment of [[gtfo|criticism]].
*Putting something stupid like "NOTICE I DO NOT OWN NICKELODEON STUDIOS" on your uploads of [[Spengbab|Spongebob]] episodes does not give you the legal right to upload them. Pointing out the fact that you don't have the intellectual property rights to the content that you uploaded without permission is like a black person riding around town holding up a sign that says "I DO NOT OWN THIS [[Bike|BIKE]]" and thinking that makes stealing it legal.
*No one made you upload anything in the first place, dumbfuck.  If your shitty vlog got taken down by some [[butthurt]] [[aspie]] or batshit [[furfag]] then fucking [[cry moar]] faggot.

People that bitch about Fair Use & DMCA in their video descriptions as a [[occupatio|preemptive strike]] against takedown are hilariously easy to troll. The best part is that their belief in themselves as experts in the legal system means they will keep responding with long-winded [[RAGE|ragefits]] about how they have the constitutional right to upload pirate copies of TV shows and movies. When you get tired of making them dance like an e-puppet for your amusement, simply email a link to the copyright owner (most studios have a link on their website for legal notices) - be polite and brief, you're not doing it for their sake but for [[lulz]]. Within a day or so the videos will be taken off YouTube, and your victim will spend the next week [[An hero|crying under their bed]] because they not only lost their precious view count, but they were proven utterly [[Arguing on the internet|wrong on the internet]].

==YouTube as a [[The Man|Corporation]]==

Have [[you]] ever wondered why YouTube doesn't seem to respond to your [[BAWWW|queries]] (once you've jumped through enough hoops just to contact them, that is) or why they do not seem to care about the [[retard|average user]]?  If you've ever wondered why YouTube doesn't seem to care about your videos being removed or flagged, your unjust banning, [[trolls|someone harassing]] [[you]], technical glitches, suggestions for improving the site, or just about any valid appeal, well...here's your answer:  

[[Image:YouTube View Count breakdown.png|thumb|center|830px|[[Google]] is simply far too busy [[stealing|making money]] off of others work to care about any supposed YouTube "Community". [[Jew gold|Dollars and sense]] baby.]]

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0bGs-hhenI This video], shown below, shows the dirty secrets of YouTube as a corporation.  For instance, nearly all popular YouTube videos are made by private companies.  One of the many of these companies is, Hi-Arts Entertainment; they create videos for 27 of the top 90 YouTube celebrities.  You pay them 36% of the profits and they make your scripts, edit your videos, and upload it.  Another thing is how all the popular people on YouTube use the technique Faking The Suspension.

==The [[Banhammer]]==

[[Image:Banhammer Mallet metal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Every [[troll]] should feel the [[cock|long hard shaft]] of the banhammer at least once.]]

YouTube punishment is usually a form of [[ban]] from the service by deleting the guilty party's account.  However, it remains unclear how long the suspension lasts since YouTube doesn't know how to use email unless it deals with an idle [[DMCA]] threat. [[Some argue|Some suggest]] a YouTuber's [[IP]] address may be blocked from the server to prevent them from ''creating'' another account, sometimes indefinitely.  These actions are thought to be invoked for such offenses as violating [[Bullshit|YouTube's Terms of Service,]] [[troll]]ing [[Renetto]], jerking off on cam while smoking a [[Cuba]]n cigar, disrespecting [[Miaarose|Mia]], or promoting [[Partyvan|illegal]] acts.  If you have been [[IP]] banned for [[TOS]] violations you will get the following message if you try and register an account:

[[Image:YouTube ban message banned.jpg|frame|center|If you get this message you got [[IP]] banned, bitch.]]

This ban is purely for the ''creation'' of accounts - if you create a new account via [[proxy]], YouTube does not re-ban you if you go back to the regular one.  

The truth is that unless you do anything that would attract the attention of [[The man|law enforcement]], most [[trolls]] can return immediately after they've been suspended and (most of the time) aren't even IP banned.  That is, of course, unless you were stupid enough to put [[Facefag|your face on cam]].  YouTube has demonstrated thus far that their policies towards banning users has been, and continues to be, '''arbitrary''' at best over the last 4 years.  This is because certain users/vloggers have demonstrably been given the dreaded ''[[perma-ban]]'' and are never allowed to return, whilst others are banned yet are allowed to return without hindrance (i.e. Theboringdispatcher, Warren25smash, etc.)  This means there is an arbitrary discrepancy between a perma-ban and a regular ban and you'll never know which the mongoloids on the [[YouTube Staff|YouTube staff]] have arbitrarily decided to give you.  

For [[DMCA]] violations there is a 3-strike rule in place, but the details surrounding this policy are still sketchy.  For example, some people have had 3 videos removed in one instance but are not banned, others have been banned for 3 separate occasions.  YouTube's employment of this "policy" has been about as straightforward as their arbitrary [[TOS]] bans mentioned above. 

Some countries like [[Turkey]], however, banned YouTube to show them who the real boss is.

===Update=== 

YouTube has made policy changes regarding bannings. Accounts can now be "[[pwnt|muted]]" for certain periods of time for [[TOS]] violations or breaches of "Community Guidelines". Being "muted" doesn't mean your account is [[banned]], it means that you may or may not be able to upload [[porn|content]], post [[comment]]s, or interact with your account  during your mute period.   As a result of the changes they have somewhat relaxed their policy towards breaches of "Community Guidelines" and [[TOS]], but not for [[DMCA]] violations - you're shit out of luck if you were banned for those.

==[[YouTube View Fraud]]==
[[Image:Viewfr_obvious.png|thumb|right|View fraud is the most obvious when new users with no subscribers do it. This video has 16 comments, rated 62 times and has 185,000+ views. [[YouTube_View_Fraud#Detecting_it|VPC:]] 11,572. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC4y84lEQ3U Link to video].]]
YouTube has had, and will continue to have, a long history of users gaming the system: scammers, frauds, and desperate [[attention whores]] all competing for attention of the average moron to give them a solitary click on their video.  Some do a little more than this though, and take extreme measures to abuse the system and garner views.  

''For moar info see the article on [[YouTube View Fraud]]''

==YouTube as explained by [[Ted Stevens|Sen. Ted Stevens]]==
[[Image:Series of tubes small.jpg|thumb|left|150px|YouTube is '''not''' a big [[truck]] either.]]
YouTube is a very great tube, on it you can see people who have made moving pictures, and put their moving picture through a bunch of gigawatts, and gilgabites, until it is on YouTube's tubes. These tubes can be viewed by other [[WHATTHEBUCKSHOW|chaps]] and can be put on other tubes, so whether you're watching a moving picture about flying machines or the new telegraph, you can always receive jollys at YouTube, and have a [[gay]] ol' time.

==YouTube [[Comment]]s==

[[Image:NIGGERNIGGERNIGGERNIGGERNIGGER.PNG|thumb|right|[[Typical]] channel comment.]]
[[Image: Doobish.JPG|thumb|right|The only comments Doobish will ever get.]]
[[Image:Youtubearguement.jpg|thumb|right|[[Typical]] YouTube [[arguing on the internet|argument]].]]
The "comments" section on every video was created with the intention of viewers to post their thoughts and opinions about any given video. Sadly, this section will ALWAYS invariably lead to a rant about [[race]], [[politics]], [[religion]], or other [[anti-lulz]] shit by some fag claiming to be an exec of a large corporate business, who somehow manages to find some time in their busy schedule to whine, bitch, moan, and [[arguing on the internet|argue for hours on the internet]] with other retards, converting a comments section of a video site into a makeshift [[forum]]. These "comments" are always responded to by similar [[basement dwellers]] and [[13 year old boy|12 year olds]], sparking a great debate, one which is seemingly decided by the vocabulary and amount of technical terminology used by either party, otherwise known as [[intellectual checkmate]].
[[Image:Lolwhatyt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Typical]] YouTube account.]]
[[Image:Titletoolong.png|right|thumb|Jew hates [[lion|lions]].]]
[[Image:RetartedYTconvo.png|thumb|right|YouTubers engaging in intelligent conversation.]]

This was by no accident, but by YouTube's design. YouTube has secret random nonsensical wordfilters (the help pages just say to try rewording your comment) that just make comments not show up and give no error message or explanation and one's well though-out comment text is then intentionally, forcibly lost through YouTube's [[Javascript]] forms so that after losing a long, thought-out comment that took 30 minutes to make, and several times in a row, people eventually just write, "[[YOUR]] A FAGGIT".

In Spring 2010, YouTube decided to troll its members further by [[bullshit | improving]] the  video page and comments section.  This has lead to a nearly unprecedented amount of [[nerd rage | NERDRAGE]] and [[butthurt]] with over 9000 users threatening to [[Quit IRL | leave Jewtube forever]].  <s>Google</s> YouTube has yet to offer a satisfactory [[jewgold | reason]] behind this change but we shall keep you posted as this shit storm develops.

'''UPDATE''':
On July 8th, [[2009]], YouTube admins decided to share some [[lulz]] by [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|CENSORING ANY YOUTUBE COMMENT]] containing any profanity.  The result included a shitstorm of hate and immediate bypass of the filter to [[RAGE|vent their frustratio]]n (FU-CK YOU YOUTUBE N_IGGERS BLOCKING OUR F-UCKING USELESS AND IDIOTIC POSTS, ***-GOTS, I'LL SODOMIZE YOUR CHILDREN WITH A BASEBALL BAT).  After a few hours, the ability to troll the comments in a regular fashion was re-instated, with censored material immediately becoming visible once again.  Much [[lolwut|confusion]] will ensue as people wonder [[wtf]] just happened and why their FUCKs' and SHITs' were covered in [[Censorship|****]] for a few hours.

===Comment Audio Preview===
Sometime in November [[2008]] YouTube ripped off an issue of [[xkcd]] by installing an "Audio Feedback" system that allows you to hear your comments read back to you before you post them.  Naturally, this idea should have stayed in the realm of "Haha, what if?" because it's completely fucking [[fail|useless]] in practice.  The only real use for the device is to amuse one's self by typing ridiculous bullshit into the comment field to hear it read back to you by a robot with a speech impediment.  This shit has never worked in the first place.

==How To Score Cheap [[Lulz]] On YouTube==
[[Image:Stealtube.jpg|thumb|right|YouTube = fail]]
If you're in for some [[lulz]], you've come to the right site.  Usually go to any video which has a lot of views (suggestions would be a religious [[JewTube]]er or some [[shit band]] videos) and just say something completely against the tide. Then a bunch of [[13 year old boys]] will type furiously about how the [[internets]] is [[serious business]]. They'll probably send you a [[email|PM]] with some long [[bullshit]] about how you are wrong. Here is a generic statement for you to use:

"''This is a total rip-off of ______________ (insert old band or movie name)''"

Better yet, if the original poster of the video is the type to actually respond to each and every comment he gets with a long argument which fills the text limit, well you can say the most racist, sexist, bigoted comments imaginable and they will respond with accusations of trolling while also flaming you back as if they think you typed those comments in the height of serious-ity. Find a user like this and you will find yourself uttering the phrase "He's responding, he's responding, I cant believe he's responding."  

The first step in getting any lulz in the above fashion first centers upon finding a tuber you don't like. <BR>
But don't worry...you will. (In fact, it's damn <s>near</s> impossible not to.)

Most YouTube users will get butthurt over just about anything, which makes them perfect [[troll]] targets. Here are some examples of YouTube butthurt and what usually happens as a result of it:
*Someone leaves a negative comment on one of their videos ''(which usually results in an endless series of video responses in which they [[fail|try]] to "[[Intellectual Checkmate|destroy]]" each other.)''
*They get their videos removed or their account suspended ''(which usually results in a major boycott plan to not log onto YouTube for an ENTIRE DAY!!!11!)''
*The ToS gets more strict (see above).

===Cloning===
A person who makes a YouTube account exactly the same but they replace the l with I or replace the I with l. If the YouTube account doesn't contain those letters than the person cannot be cloned. Clones also must clone the listed friends and make a copy of the person's YouTube videos. Another popular method is copy and pasting the original person's profile. Clones work when the person closes the account as well because then if you close the clone account and spam someone they will think it's the person you're cloning that did the spamming. You can also use clone to disguise as someone to become an admin of a stream. Then you can ban every moderator in the stream when nobody is in there. As you can tell this can cause [[lulz|mass confusion]].

<B>Example:</B>
Here's an [http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSaneRevelation original channel] and here's [http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSaneReveIation its clone].

Here is another [http://www.youtube.com/user/randomlaughingman original channel] and here is the [http://www.youtube.com/user/Rand0mIaughingman clone].

There is currently a Clone Wars raging amongst a faction of dedicated trolls and YouTube user [http://www.youtube.com/user/Beamshipscaptain Beamshipcaptain]. The original declaration of war was made in October 2009 by now banned clone leader "TheBeamshipCaptain".  

Several other trolls have now taken arms and created clone accounts. There are currently at least 10 clone accounts, ranging from [http://www.youtube.com/user/BeamshipsRevenge BeamshipsRevenge] to [http://www.youtube.com/user/MorganshipCaptain MorganshipCaptain], and [http://www.youtube.com/user/randombeamshipman randombeamshipman](who is a hybrid of [[randomlaughingman|randomlaughingman]] and beamshipcaptain).

The clone armies will not rest untill the internets have been purged of these idiots.

== The Subscriber Security Hole ==
[[Image:Prntscreen22.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Another prime example of YouYube fucking up the page [[shit|design]]]]
Some time ago [[Anonymous]] discovered whoever coded YouTube [[fail|sucks]] and left a security hole on their website for people to exploit.  It involves a YouTube user's subscribers count on their profile page and how it can be exploited. 

Here's how it works:
*1) Subscribe to target user
*2) Unsubscribe
*3) Repeat
*4) [[????]]
*5) [[PROFIT]]

The first time a user subscribes, the subscribers count increments by 1, but does [[not|NOT]] increment any time you do it again. However, unsubscribing will decrement their count by 1. [[4chan|eBaum's World]] eventually found note of this and decided to attack [[Lonelygirl15]]'s page and bring the count from tens of thousands of subscribers down to 0. It has also been done to her [[retard|longface]], Jew-nosed [[fag|widow]] '''Danielbeast''' and other various YouTubers like [[Daxflame]] and [[VenomFangX]]. A script has also been developed to exploit this hole with about as much manpower as an [[Indian]] call center...but [http://img410.imageshack.us/img410/5972/howierma1.jpg nobody can seem to locate it.]
The glitch was short lived before YouTube employees got off their asses and did something about it, but the [[BAWWWW|whining]] from vloggers across the site was incessant and pointed for this short period as many users were upset about losing their [[honorz]].  

===Update:=== 
The [[YouTube Staff|YouTube staff]] finally got this shit fixed.  Hallefuckingjulah, it only took them a year and a half.

===Update:===
There's was recently another [[goatse|gaping security hole]] based on the [[YouTube Subscriber Hack|same principle]]. HURR DURR YEAH BOSS WE TOTALLY FIXED THAT SUBSCRIBER BUG.

== Comment Security Hole ==
{{main|YouTube Independence Day}}
July 4th, 2010, at 6:17 AM Eastern Time, the very first thread went up on Ebaumsworld' forums. Detailing a script that you could plug in to make your text red and scroll across the page. Soon, it was discovered that not only did this delete/hide all other comments besides yours, but that it rendered every button except the ones on the video itself as useless as a [[Faggot|Brit's dick]]. Cries to infect the pages of [[Shota|Justin Bieber]], [[Fred]], and [[G4]] were made. It was [[lulz]]y, all was well. 

Then someone posted a thread on [[/b/]]. 

Within the hour, a few new scripts had appeared, one would render the entire background black. Nothing except the video playing. Another would allow you to make fake message boxes when the page opened. But the third is where things get out of hand. The final one allowed [[you]] to redirect videos to anywhere on the [[internet]]. Combined with the now unflaggable videos, [[cp]], [[gore]], and [[porn]] in general began to popup disguised as "[[Justin Bieber]] - Baby," or "[[Lady Gaga]] - Poker Face."

Meanwhile, Ebaums was in its usual disorganized chaos. /v/ had started it all with a code obtained from /g/, then /b/ entered the picture due to /v/ and shit hit the fan. Moralfags came out in droves, /b/ was flooded with [[Jewtube]] Assault images. Everyone believed that the final battle between [[4chan]] and YouTube was about to ensue. A new Ragnarok of the internet. Some said it was being taken to far, that innocent people would be [[v&]]. These people were, predictably, promptly ignored.

Obviously, YouTube kicked its shit into high gear. Three and a half hours in, "Safety Mode" was live. Opening the comments still activated the scripts as normal, but now they weren't automatic. The push was losing steam on 4chan, as more and more moralfags woke up and took time away from their [[Whore|mother]]'s dried up teat to post their [[Neckbeard|OUTRAGE]]. This [[bitch|bitch move]] thus draining morale on the shitposters even further. 

In the aftermath, 4chan was blamed for the incident, as planned by the cock-lovers at [[EbaumsWorld]]. In reality, 4chan did not find the exploit.

==YouTube Impersonators==

[[Image:You Fail.jpg|thumb|right|Apparently not.]]

[[Image:Jewtubelul.png|thumb|right|Mods are monkeys?]]

===FeelMyTube===
One of MANY porn knockoffs to be mentioned.

===[[Bestiality|Beast]] Tube===
<strike>It's where furfags go to fap.</strike> Do you even need to fucking ask?

===Kissyoutube===
Type in "kiss" before a YouTube video, and you can download it.
Ex: www.youtube.com/whateverthehellvideoyourewatching becomes www.'''kiss'''youtube.com/whateverthehellvideoyourewatching.

=== Dailymotion ===
Dailymotion will one day replace YouTube for all your internets blogging needs. God Bless those Gay Frenchfags!

=== [[JewTube]] ===
[[Image:Jewtube lawl.jpg|thumb|It's fucking real]]
A website comprised of Jewish-oriented user-generated content.  JewTube was founded by Jeremy Kossen, a Los Angeles-based Jew that was afraid the domain would be used for lulz.  
Jewtube is also a great place to buy and sell blue-eyed gentile babies so you can crucify them for unknown [[Kabbalah]] rituals... 

Oddly enough, [[Google]] is trying to out-jew the New York City based company NetParty for the use of the name '''"JewTube"''', on trademark grounds. Ironically, Google is headed by a trio of [[Nazi]]s.

=== NSFW YouTube ===
Allows you watch YouTube videos that you need to be 18+ to view. Put nsfw in the address and you watch any video you want.
Ex: www.youtube.com/whateverthehellvideoyourewatching becomes www.'''nsfw'''youtube.com/whateverthehellvideoyourewatching.

===Podblanc===
*http://podblanc.com/
Racial or "racist" stuff that YouTube bans is allowed here...

===Pornotube===
If you don't like [[masturbation|jacking off]] to [[emo]] videos and [[camwhore|camwhores]] then Pornotube is for you! Just make sure to click on Straight Content before browsing, else you come upon an absolutely [[gay]] video of three guys [[Lemonparty|jacking off on each other.]] Due to Pornotube's [[pie|sorting algorithm]] you will probably  be overwhelmed with cocks in the "straight" section as well.  This is not a bug, you are a [[fag|closet homosexual]] and they know.

=== Redtube ===
See Youporn

===[[Shockingtube]]===
A wannabe [[YouPorn]] site hosting a wide range of fucked-up shit of highly questionable legality and <s>fagality</s> in video format.   Ex.Meatspin,BME Pain Olympics,Fred.

=== Trampletube ===
For [[sick fucks]].

===[[Vloggerheads]]===
[[Renetto]]'s answer to YouTube. Predicted to die before [[last Thursday|next Thursday]]. See the article for moar details.

===[[Xtube]]===
Xtube is a copycat of YouTube, but instead of regular shitty [[webcam]] videos, this has regular shitty webcam porno videos. The only thing that would make this less shitty is if it had [[at least 100 years ago|less than 9,000]] videos of your mom being blasted by some fag.

*<s>http://www.xtube.com/play_re.php?v=7viFI-S122-

The lollercaust will be televised.</s> Or not.

It's also the only YouTube pornographic impostor to have a furfag community.

=== YouJizz ===
This site has [[porn]] (duh) but it mostly contains guys blowing their loads on some random [[whore]]s face.

=== [[Youporn]] ===
This site is for horny [[13 year old boys]] with no life and an obvious addiction to cumming on their computer screens.

=== EmpFlix===

Normal porn, of reasonable length and quality for people who don't masturbate to car-accidents. Not for 4chan.

===Yuvutu===
Yet another 3rd rate porno knockoff.

===Outube===
A porn website that was made in case little kids accidentally misspelled YouTube. After many complaints the website was changed so it looks nothing like YouTube.

===<s>88tube===
88=HeilHitler+Tube=...take a guess! Has racial music on the front page currently.
*http://www.88tube.net/</s>Not anymore!

=== [[Godtube]] ===
Well it's not for atheists so just take a guess.

*http://godtube.com/

=== [[Yiffytube]] ===
The furries got tired of websites with no furry porn so they made their own YouTube clone dedicated to only furry videos.

==Further Drama==
The frequent battlecry YouTube posties fret over is its growing ties to the [[old media|corporate media]]. <BR>
*[[Renetto|Paul Robinett]] told the ''New York Post'' "It is starting to appear as though the regular guy doesn't have a chance on YouTube anymore. The majority of the content on YouTube belongs to people like me, yet they seem to be cutting deals with everyone that owns content but us." <BR>
*"I'm starting to feel some twinges of betrayal," said Ben Going (aka Boh3M3). They seem to be more money-oriented than I imagined."

==YouTube's "Community Council"==
Since Damien Estreich failed so epically at his job as an "advocate" for the community, YouTube, in an act of pure laziness, decided to create a "Community Council" to direct any complaints (because they are too busy making [[money]]) from the "community" to 5 users: Bravesgirl5, {{youtube2|BradOFarrell|bradofarrell}}, {{youtube2|sarrycrey|sarrycrey}}, {{youtube2|tlg847|tlg847}}, {{youtube2|visiblemode|Visblemode}}.

</center>

===Update:===

YouTube's officially sanctioned "Community Council" is now completely [[ruin|defunct]].

==YouTube RickRolls [[You]]==
[[Image:YouTube April Fools faggotry 2009.png|thumb|right|They did something even gayer the next year.]]
On [[April Fools Day]], 2008, the fags at JewTube redirected all featured video links to Rick Astley's [[Never Gonna Give You Up]], hoping users would applaud JewTube for its originality and suck its [[e-penis|e-cock]].  This pathetic attempt at an April Fools joke "fooled" nearly [[Over 9000|one hundred thousand]] [[newfags|people]], attempting to milk an already [[old meme|dead meme]] for everything it's worth. Not since [[douchebag|Carson Daily]] Rickrolled his own audience on national television or the [[Rickroll#Rickrolling the Nation|Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] has there been such blatant faggotry. '''Update''': [[Nancy Pelosi#Death of Rickrolling|Someone]] actually managed to top it. 

==YouTube's New Channel Designs==
[[Image:New_channels_screenshot.png|thumb|left|Proof that YouTube's new channel design is [[shit]]]]
In [[2009]], YouTube started changing everyone's channels and renamed them [[Santorum|Goo]]Tube [[beta]].  In July, they made it fully mandatory.  

Features of the new design:
* 90% of the [[link]]s and buttons on your channel page are [[Javascript|JavaScript]].  None of them work except in [[Internet Explorer|IE]] 4.0 with security features [[ass rape|completely off]] and only version 4.0.
* No one can view your [[faggotry|video]]s, your [[porn|favorites]], [[etc]].
* Channel [[comments]] links.  For instance if your YouTube username is <nowiki>http://www.youtube.com/user/ScarletSanctum</nowiki> , your link to view the next series of comments is the broken link <nowiki>http://www.youtube.com/user/&start=10</nowiki> .  You have to correct YouTube's own faulty [[HTML]] by editing their link and making it <nowiki>http://www.youtube.com/user/ScarletSanctum&start=10</nowiki> .

YouTube's initial [http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2009/06/new-channels-coming-soon_9910.html blog] about the changes has received nothing but complaints from the "YouTube Community" and their "help" [[forum]]s have had the same reaction to the faulty [[beta]] design since early Spring.  YouTube never fixed any of the problems with their shitty design and has now decided to make the new channel design mandatory and only old accounts from before the changeover are allowed to retain their oringal look. This is YouTube's way of proving that none of their [[monkeys|employees]] have ever visited their own website.

==YouTube [[2010]]==
[[Image:YouTube verified accounts.png|thumb|right|You're just piling fail on top of fail now.]]
[[Image:Google_Promotes_Freedom_of_Speech.jpg|thumb|right|US Government robots collude with YouTube to block unwanted facts which they "copyrighted."]]

===YouTube Wants Your [[Dox]]===
So some of [[you]] might have thought that in 5 years of YouTube's clueless [[fucktards|administration]] they couldn't possibly make worse decisions than they already have; well it turns out you were very fucking [[wrong]].  YouTube has now made new changes that have nerds [[rage|raging]] again:  

*They implemented an "[[Dox|account verification]]" system, demanding you give them a fucking [[cell phone]] number just to open an [[sock|account]].  This is by far the queerest change they've made in years.  The days of being able to set up socks at lightning speed are over and it means they're fewer and harder to come by.   So enjoy your fucking [[txt]] [[spam]] and [[This is the second notice that the factory warranty on your vehicle is expiring|telemarketers]] if you sign up for a new one.   '''Sidenote''': There have actually been reports that YouTube doesn't always seem to ask for this during sign-up, but this is a [[myth]] at this point.   
*They changed the video page layout towards a [[retard|crack-baby]] interface, moving shit around and implementing [[I CAME|like]]/[[gtfo|dislike]] ratings rather than the old star system, they also added some a faggy '[[autoplay]]' list of assumingly related shit to the right that [[nobody]] can figure out.   
*Fucked up the [[comment]] system, again. 
*They have now implemented subscription limits. The number of subscriptions you can have is somehow derived from the number of subscribers you have. 

[[Image:YoutubeRage.jpg|thumb|right|Just some of the thousands of comments that express [[rage]] at the new layout.]]

The thing is, now older YouTube accounts (ones from the first half of [[2007]] or earlier) are at a premium because these accounts are unique in that: 

# <s>They do not require the [[faggotry|new layout]] and are thusly much less [[fag]]gy.</s> - they've now been assimilated too  
# They are able to upload vids over [[tl;dw|10 minutes]].   
# They have less [[ass]] in general.   

Rest assure these are just a taste of the [[shitty]]ness YouTube has in store for us this year.
