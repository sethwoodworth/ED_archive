Basketball
[[Image:Basketball Midget.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Basketball is my favourite sport, I [[Gay|love]] how they dribble [[Fap|up down]] the court!]]

'''Basketball''' pretty much describes itself. Being the black person choice of sport, basketball is something between [[bulletball]] and [[soccer]] - awesome at times, but [[homosexual]] in general. While it is technically the [[Loser|second]] most famous sport on the planet, [[Nobody likes you|nobody really likes]] basketball, except for the niggas and [[Lithuania|lithuanians]].

== Ancient history ==

Basketball was ejaculated by some faggot Canadian who fled to [[USA|America]] sometime around 1910. This obviously not being tragic enough, the sport actually became famous. A couple of decades and there is the [[Extreme advertising|fucking]] NBA. There's not much history to basketball, actually; the only thing worth mention is that basketball players in the 80s wore these [[retarded]] shorts that were [[gay]] beyond [[faggotry]]. [[PROTIP]]: Mention that a Canadian invented basketball to a American nigra for extreme butthurt and lulz.

== How do I shot ball ==
[[Image:Gaybasketball.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Every single basketball picture cointains gay. [[Srs]]. [[Rule 34|No exceptions]].]] 
The basketball general rules aren't that complicated either, because if they were, how the fuck would niggers play it? Anyway, you get the ball and you shoot into the basket. Congratulations - you are now eligible to join the NBA. Also, you have to dribble the ball, can't step out of the court and you can't [[Punch|show a nigger wassup]] - the last regulation is obviously the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJGxA3GTTtU&feature=related hardest for the ballers to stand].

However even if you follow these rules, the local [[retards|referees]] have the last call - which is wrong [[99%]] of the time. Just watch this:

It is a [[fact]] that every single basketball player worth/not worth [[shit]] is in the NBA. The National [[Buttsecks|Basketball]] Association is called the best basketball league there is; however, it's just a big mantrain of [[niggers]]. Here are some notable "superstars":
*Magic Johnson - known to all basketball fans as [[Lie|TEH SECOND BEST BASKETBALL PLAYAR OF ALL TIME!!11!!]]. However, he has [[AIDS]] because he was receiving anal and giving blow to his basketball teammates.
*Michael Jordan - the mascot for basketball, also rich as fuck. He is frequently called the best basketball player there ever was; little do these [[retards]] know that he sucks [[cock]] throughout all games.
*Lebron James - he was supposed to be the next Jordan, but how is he any good if he [[Troll|HASN'T WON AN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP]]? He also likes to eat his fingernails. [[Sick fuck]].
*Kobe Bryant - at least this one managed to win the trophy. 5 times. Also mastered the way of [[cry|crying]] his way out of [[rape]] charges.
*Larry Bird - [[Loser|ancient player, white ginger]].
*Gilbert Arenas - got [[B&]] from the NBA for a while for attempting to [[Gun|cap]] a fellow nigga.

== Basketball for the virgins ==

Since almost every person on the internet is so [[fat]], [[There are no girls on the internet|he]] is permanently inable to move, many great video game designers such as [[EA]] Sports took time to create [[Fail|basketball video games]] for such sad basketball fans described above. Sadly, every single one of these basketball franchises failed miserably. Also, you can create a 7.2 nigger [[pedophile]]-looking nigger in NBA Live.

== Lulzy events and mentions ==

A sport isn't a sport if it doesn't have any [[retarded]] misunderstandings, epic fails and overall memorable moments and/or things, either popularized by [[4chan|4chan's]] [[sp|/sp/]] board or simply being bad enough to become [[Meme|memes]] without no actual effort.

=== Vince Carter ===

While not an event, /vc/ shot into memedom with the help of /sp/. There are no actual reasons why Vince Carter is seen as such a [[No|funny]] thing, it's just that he sucks. He was known for his hardcore [[Anal|slam dunks]], but now when he's in the Orlando Magic, Dwight Howard stole his spotlight as the key slammer, so he went back to the worthless and [[Loser|attention-unworthy self]] that he truly is. 

=== Buzzerbeating ===

Last seconds of the game. Your team is losing by one point. [[You]] get the ball. You shoot, and as you hear the stupid [[Vuvuzela|"BRRRZZZ"]] sound, the ball hits the basket, thus earning the win for your team. What you just scored was a buzzer-beater, also known as a "clutch shot". A buzzerbeater occurs in almost every game of basketball, yet it is still considered [[awesome]], because, well, it can make one team [[Bawww|cry]] and the other team [[FUCK YEA|celebrate]] in a matter of seconds. What's not to like? 

Anyway, over the history of basketball, there were several buzzerbeaters that were not only awesome, but also fucking [[hardcore]]. One was known as "The [[Shit|Shot]]" - Michael Jordan made it against the Cavaliers, won the game and also won the series. It was actually nothing much, except that Jordan, when shooting the ball, did a retarded jump and thus gained insane [[Science|hang-time]], and thus staying in the air for [[over 9000]] seconds. 

=== Havlicek stole the ball! ===

"Havlicek stole the ball" is a quote that was blurted out by some [[fat]] and stupid broadcaster in a game of Boston Celtics fighting the Philadelphia 76ers. Yes, it is not a meme, but it's probably the earliest example [[IRL]] of [[all caps]]; what's not to like?

{{quote|And Havlicek steals it! Over to Sam Jones. [[Copy and paste|Havlicek stole the ball]]! [[Cum|It's all over]]! It's [[Oneoneone|allll]] over! Johnny Havlicek is being [[Rape|mobbed]] by the fans! It's allll over! [[Copy and paste|Johnny Havlicek stole the ball!]]|Johnny Most, obviously excited about the win.}}

=== Game 7 ===

A "Game 7" is played in a first-to-4-wins Playoff series, wherein the two teams are tied (in this situation, both are at 3 wins) and the said Game 7 is a deciding match where the "[[Epin|winner wins everything]]". Of course the deciding match can be Game 5, Game 3 or Game [[Over 9000]], depending on the number of wins needed, but since in the NBA you need four wins, Game 7 is the most widely known term because NBA is [[serious business]]. A game like this happens quite often, however it still is probably the highest peak of [[drama]] there can be in basketball, hence the [[13 year old boys|young basketball enthusiasts]] saying things like "OMG this game is so tense i'm going to [[crap]] my [[shit]]".

The latest Game 7 to happen is the Lakers vs. Celtics match in the NBA Finals, and since a 3-3 series in the finals is [[hardcore]], everybody expected to see a pissholdingly suspenseful match, but what everybody saw was the Lakers [[Pwnage|ass-breaking]] penis inside Boston's pink asshole. [[Waambulance|But seriously, going so far only to lose in such a close series should be heartbreaking]].

=== Raptor devours cheerleader ===

A raptor devoured a cheerleader. [[FUCK YEA|Yes.]] Needless to say, bitch got what she deserved - why the fuck wasn't she in the kitchen, making raptornip?
