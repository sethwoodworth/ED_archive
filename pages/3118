Fuckkk everyone
{{lj|fuckkk_everyone}} was a [[communal journal]] (not to be confused with [[community]]). A bunch of us used it and had a good time. Eventually it got [[suspended]].

I used fuckkk_everyone to troll some friends of my [[IRL]] friends. Once, I made a corresponding [[AIM]] SN, and starting Lulz with this real douche bag on-line. Since he was friends with my IRL pal I knew a lot about him, like his phone number and where he lived. After I made it clear that I know everything about him (I also did a [[WHOIS]] [[lol]]), he invited me over to his house (which was about 5 miles away) ([[wtf]]). I said "ok", and then went to bed. 

Turns out, he called the cops on me, but when they showed up nobody was there because LOL I was sleeping.  Hilarious as usual.
