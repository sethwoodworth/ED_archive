[[Image:Vheadsbanner.jpg|center|600px]]

When legions of fragile [[vlogger]]s first sought refuge in [[The Promised Land]] during The Great Exodus over a year and a half ago, the emotionally frail masses desired a sanctuary from [[haters]], from [[trolls]], from the daily reminders of how [[anti-social|socially inept]], [[no one likes you|unwanted]], and [[fugly|un-photogenic]] most of them really are.  A few people found it.  Most did not.  Since that day the silently [[low-life|desperate]] and perpetually [[butthurt|disgruntled]] have pined for an [[unrealistic expectations|utopic vlogger Shangri-La]]. Enter '''[http://www.vloggerheads.com/ Vloggerheads.com]'''.

==Origins==
[[Image:Renetto das Vloggerheads7.jpg|right|thumb|350px|[[Hitler|Paul]] knows best.]]
After 2 years on the tubes, [[Renetto]] had become disillusioned with his [[YouTube]] experience; he'd fallen out of favor with the [[YouTube Staff|YouTube staff]], most people had become tired of his consistent [[misleading thumbnail|thumbnail cheating]], his [[SSP|sensationalist tactics]], and his penchant for [[drama bomb|controversial]] and shallow content.  The YouTube "community" had become saavy to the fact taht [[renetto]] (aka Paul Robinett} would do nearly anything to get [[honorz|views]].  And after a brief attempt at creating [[drama]] once more by [[victim complex|whining]] incessantly over being [[DMCA]]'d and engaging in a failed (and very [[shit nobody cares about|anti-climactic]]) [[flame war]]s with [[Greg Solomon]] again, Paul made a statement (in true [[drama queen]] fashion) that he was going to leave YouTube [[Delete fucking everything|forever]] - this despite being part of YouTube's [[hookers and blow|partner program]].  Of course, he never actually <i>did</i> leave (and never will) but this lead him to steal a previously failed idea from other YouTube vloggers first initiated at the turn of 2006-7: an exclusive "vlogger" website (initially titled "[[LOL WUT|RenettoTube]]").  The site was launched at the end of July, 2008.   

==The Site Itself==

[[Image:Krystal can't enjoy her sandwich Vloggerheads1.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Krystal can't enjoy her sandwich|:(]]]]
'''Vloggerheads.com''' is a website that offers solace to [[wannabe|aspiring]] [[internet celebrity|e-celebrities]], the [[victim complex|emotionally delicate]], the [[delusional|naive]], the [[you don't have any friends|lonely]], and anyone else whom feels [[BAWWWWW|under-appreciated]] in their failed [[cry moar|ventures into vlogdom]].  The site is essentially a shoddy mirror of an [[old|archaic]] version of [[YouTube]] (on the [[Ning]] platform) with the mission statement of offering a "[[hugbox|hate-free]]" environment for [[vlogger]]s which supposedly incorporates an active "[[unrealistic expectations|anti-trolling]]" system to discourage <s>trolling</s> any behavior not sanctioned by the powers that be. Vloggerheads is also the bi-polar opposite to another pathetic Ning site known as [http://www.dramatube.net DramaTube.net]. Both sites troll each other on a daily basis and their combined butt fuckery has managed to reach a new pinnacle in epic failure. The site originally operated on a virtual blocking system based on the honor system, ie. if you were asked by someone not to post comments on their videos/contact them, you would be [[banned]] if you continue to.  This was all but abandoned shortly thereafter as well as the ambiguous nomination system originally in place where, if member invited is banned from the site (for whatever reason), the person who nominated them loses their ability to nominate/invite in the future.  Renetto, who touted an "[[dox|Identity Verification]]" program to validate memberships as a gimmick for the site to discourage trolling, abandoned this idea not long after as well.  The Vloggerheads Gestapo ({{youtube2|tlg847|tlg847}}, {{youtube2|renetto|renetto}}, {{youtube2|Kenrg|Kenrg}}, {{youtube2|Faintstarlite|Faintstarlite}}, {{youtube2|josephbeuys|josephbeuys}}, {{youtube2|Periurban|Periurban}}) have essentially made compromise after compromise to the point that there is almost no moderation at all now, not that it matters since the site's activity has slowed to a crawl.  

The term [[unwarranted self importance]] truly fails to adequately encompass the exact intentions and mindset of the creator(s), since, for all intents and purposes, the site is simply a [[failed]] attempt to create online [[Elitism|oligarchy]] for the faint of heart.  Proven abuse of power was shown to be shockingly common since the site's inception.  [[Free speech]] is more a privilege there than a right and should you annoy the [[admin]]strators, who've made surgical efforts to feign the notion they rule with a "[[no|fair]]" hand, you may find your ass [[permabanned|curbside]].  The blatant [[irony]] of the existence of '''Vloggerheads''' is that the site itself, which is supposedly a [[nobody cares|drama-free]] zone, was the brainchild of the biggest [[drama whore]] in the history of YouTube itself.  The stench of [[faggotry]] and [[pretentious]]ness resulting from the '''Vloggerheads''' drama polluted YouTube for a good portion of the summer of [[2008]].  

The site was and is still home to many [[butthurt|scorned]] vloggers and past [[YouTube]] and [[Live Video]] [[lolcows]], individuals whom desperately desire a place to drone on about the [[boring]] aspects of their days without the risk of having their fragile [[ego]]s levelled by [[trolls|meanies]] leaving a nasty [[text]] [[comment]].  The userbase largely consists of [[lamers]], [[old]] men, and the [[typical|garden variety]] online outcast (as well as real life [[#Give Us Your Tired, Your Poor...Your Registered Pedophiles...|pedophiles]]).  The site is, in a lot of ways, just a more [[fucktarded|ill-conceived]] version of [[The Kewl Kids|the kewl kids]] club of yesteryear.  In October, 2008, renetto gave up on his plans to keep Vloggerheads a closed community and opened it's doors for public viewing, probably due to Paul's desperation to maintain site-traffic and his [[obvious|not-too-subtle]] marketing plans for the site.  

The site is a symbol of the misplaced [[nostalgia]] the fragile have for the 'good ol' days' on [[YouTube]]; a hope that it would provide the solace they felt [[Live Video]] promised them.  Many were anxious to join the site with the hopes that it would some how wind the clocks back to [[2006]] for them, releasing them from their ever-present fear of [[trolls]], or somehow wipe away their embarrassing e-trails of [[self-pwn|self-ownage]].  The site is a manifestation of a deep desire the frail and easily vexed share for an exclusive online [[circlejerk|clubhouse]] or an [[perfect|idyllic]] vlogger paradise.  One that never existed in the first place.  Eventually the platform hopes include [[hivemind|group think]] software and scented candles shaped in the form of [[dildo]]s.

'''Vloggerheads''' is a both a confirmation and timely reminder that it is still [[serious business]] on the tubes.

==Sweet [[Irony]]==

After 2 years on the tubes, [[Argent009]], a man who's [[ORLY|had his problems with trolls]], made a very astute commentary on Vloggerheads.  Argent used to consider the internets very [[serious business]], but seems to have drastically changed his philosophy on the internet and [[trolls]] over time.  He warns Vloggerheads users that they are only inviting trollage with their faggotry.

{{quote|1=There are a few people who you guys would consider "haters" that were able to teach me a few things about being a vlogger.  One of the first things is if you take yourself seriously, and you're a vlogger...you're asking for trouble.  You have to realize that if you're putting your face out here on the internet, you're an [[attention whore]], and you are [[asking for it|asking]] for people to [[flame|criticize]] everything you do.  You're ''asking'' for people to look at your videos and pick out everything you could do that could be possibly wrong, and point it out.  Why else would you be on here if you weren't a bit of an attention whore?|2=[[Argent009]]|3=shortly before Hell froze over}}

==Give Us Your Tired, Your Poor...Your Registered Pedophiles...==

[[Image:Joshua_RSO.JPG|thumb|Joshua's other account on the [http://www.nsopr.gov/ Dept of Justice website]. ]]
The vlogging Mecca was rocked with scandal in October of 2008 when it was discovered that within these hallowed halls was none other than registered sex offender Joshua Adam Harrison. Apparently Joshua had made it through the Vheads ultra-intensive security measures without a hitch. When questioned about their judgement in this matter, one founding member responded:
{{quote|1=And, what if the record is correct? What should we do?|2=[http://www.youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&v=1TdIqY7Rq_c&fromurl=/watch%3Fv%3D1TdIqY7Rq_c tlg847]}}
When asked about the possible dangers to children, Tom also had this to say: 
{{quote|1=VH is an over-18 site. And, we're also public. That means that anybody can view the site but only people who claim to be over 18 can interact with others. If there's somebody lying about their age on our site, they really aren't doing too much more than they could so simply by watching the vid publicly. And, to be honest, the age-verifying lie detectors were just a tad over our budget at this point. BTW, if you'd seen our site you'd see that kids aren't very likely to want to spend time there.|2=[http://www.youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&v=1TdIqY7Rq_c&fromurl=/watch%3Fv%3D1TdIqY7Rq_c tlg847]}}
[[Image:No_Kids_On_Vloggerheads.JPG|thumb|center|500px|[http://www.vloggerheads.com/profile/Andrew Whoops!] Looks like the [[Young Tubers United]] slipped through too.]]

==The Future of Vloggerheads==
[[Image:Renetto vloggerheads jews.jpg|center|510px]]<br />
There isn't one. <br />
Under every scenario the inevitable [[ruin|collapse]] of the website is an obvious denouement.  More [[shitty|shoddy]] than [[Live Video]] and twice as restrictive, it was doomed from its conception.  There are many reasons why the site isn't likely to last, but whether the site is able to weather those initial hurdles or not (it wasn't), it has received enough bad publicity to seriously affect it's growth and appeal - growth that was already stunted by the enormous [[logic|obstacles]] the creator(s) faced simply getting the site off the ground.   In October [[2008]], Vloggerheads opened it's doors for public viewing as a last-ditch effort to some how drive more traffic there, only no one gave a shit anymore.  

Originally Renetto [[pimp]]ed Vloggerheads on the premise that members would have to provide their credit card number and/or a wealth of [[dox|personal information]] to remain on the site.  This [[faggotry]] was '''completely abandoned''' due to widespread opposition and the [[obvious]] impracticality of the idea in the first place.  This was never more than [[gimmick]] that was promoted to get the [[butthurt]] to come to the site from YouTube.  Of course, this wasn't before Renetto had actually gotten [[dox]] on several people who, [[idiots|for some reason]], over-anxiously offered up their personal info to him '''before''' they were actually ''required to'' in accordance with any proposed site "policies".  This was only the beginning of the [[fail]].

{{quote|
[[ORLY|Tom was being dishonest.  I don't believe at the point he set up Vloggerheads that there was any prospect of the tropolus ever coming into being and I think he knew it.  He mislead the community.  

I was a fool to believe in Tom and the project so much.  Vloggerheads is a lost cause; the community we once had is fragmented beyond repair.  If there was any opportunity, if there was any opportunity at all, it is now gone]].|{{youtube2|Periurban|Periurban}}|former admin at Vloggerheads.}}<br>
<center>TL;DR: <big><big>'''[[GG]]'''</big></big></center><br>

[[Image:Shitty Vloggerheads clones.jpg|thumb|right|Other sad attempts to create "vlogging" sites.]]
An unfortunate by-product of the Vloggerheads debacle was that every [[lazy]] and unoriginal [[moron]] eventually began creating their own shitty [[Ning]] vloggers sites (ie. [http://www.dramatube.net Dramatube], [http://www.moarvideo.tv/ Moarvideo], etc.), in-turn believing they would create the next vlogger hot-spot, each managing to be even more [[lame]] than Vlogggerheads itself, and each worse than the next.  And now every [[asshole]] and their [[your mom|mother]] has some shitty Ning site to post their [[dogshit]] [[no one]] will ever see.  

The thing was also that Vloggerhead's traffic had slowed to a crawl well before all this despite [[Renetto]]'s [[fail|best efforts]] to pimp the site on [[YouTube]] - which he did by actually [[stealing]] other users' videos and posting them on his channel without their permission ([[greedy|monetizing]] them in the process) - and taking every chance he could to spam his thinly veiled [[SSP|advertisements]] on YouTube or [[victim complex|pretend VH was "under attack" by trolls]].  The [[truth]] is that the goals of the site and the founding members were far too [[unrealistic expectations|utopian]] to begin with and it has become more and more apparent that Renetto's ultimate goal was to market the site for some manner of sell-off or [[profit]] sometime in the [[never|future]].  

===The TLDR Version:===
[[Image:Circa Rigel Vloggerheads1.png|thumb|right|[[Circa Rigel]] seems to feel "betrayed".]]
[[Image:Vloggerheads fail.jpg|frame|left]]

Renetto is one of YouTube's most notable [[troll]]s himself.  His Vloggerheads venture basically equates to a mass manipulation of a bunch of thin-skinned [[low-life]]s to jump on board his sinking ship whilst never giving a shit about them to begin with, all in a secret plan to turn a profit down the line.  Now, those same retards are feigning false [[cry moar|indignation]] and [[bawww|whining]] endlessly about being "[[whore|used]]" and "[[obvious|lied to]]", and actually [[Stupidity|believed one of the most notorious and shameless megalomaniacs on YouTube cared about them in the first place]].  But chalk this one up as yet another [[failure]] on his part, and on every level, since the site is currently a fucking [[nobody cares|ghost town]].

{{quote|The vloggers claim their new community is already “[[trolled|under attack]]” by bullies from YouTube, and considering the urgency with which they address the camera, you almost expect to hear [[pwned|bombs]] in the background — but then you remember that [[pedos|middle-aged men]] who spend all their time making videos on YouTube [[unwarranted self importance|might also take all sorts of things more seriously than most people]].|From [http://newteevee.com/2008/08/19/youtube-community-at-vloggerheads/ NewTeeVee] a lame ass blog about "viral" video}}

==Trivia==

*Vloggerheads is registered on [[Ning]].com.  It is not so much its own site as a private group on an [[wikipedia:ning|existing website]], one that specializes in hosting private [[porn]] groups.  
*The site has partially functioned as an exploit for [[Renetto]] to collect [[dox|info]] on perceived E-enemies.
There's a profile on Dramatube labeled 'Renetto' people think it's an impersonator, but it is in fact [http://www.dramatube.net/profile/Renetto Renetto himself].
