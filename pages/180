A bit sus
It is [[common knowledge]] that sus stands for suspicious. "A bit sus" (often accompanied by surreptitious nose tapping, which makes people look [[stupid]]) is an adjective meaning that an innuendo has just occurred, is currently in the process of occurring, or will occur in the near future, or that something or somebody is not what it seems. Its main use is [[irony]], because anyone who doesn't get the joke is either not a raging faggot, or an [[idiot]].

== Nothing Sus ==
Stemming from a defunct TV show in which two [[homosexual]] men did suspicious things like vaccuum clean each others pants and suck on large sausages, following which they would say "[[not gay|Nothing sus]]!" Nothing Sus is therefore synonymous with A Bit Sus, only with extra [[irony]], unless you are already using A Bit Sus with [[irony]], in which case it signifies that the innuendo involved [[gay|teh ghey]].
