Gigaloader
[[Image:gigaloader.jpg|right|thumb|[[DDoS|"Server stress testar"]]]]
'''Gigaloader''' was a website that made the creating of [[lulz]] much easier by constantly loading the images of another webpage you didn't like. This fucking pwned the bandwidth of your most hated website to the point where the owner would be so overcome by the hosting fees, they would hopefully become [[an hero]]. Gigaloader was known to both [[Internet_Tough_Guy|hackers on steroids]] and [[Computer_Science_3|website programmers]]. However, the Gigaloader site now says that it has been disabled. The domain is up for sale.

==How it worked==

#Anonymous declares war on a website
#[[Over 9000|Over 9,000]] people post [[copypasta]]'d image lists to gigaloader
#Anonymous wins the [[Internets|internet]]
#[[Butthurt|Blacklisted]]!
#??????
#[[Profit!]]

==Other Shit==
The website also had some other tools, like the proxychecker, which checked to see how [[anonymous]] your connection is if you're behind a proxy. This was useful if you enjoy wearing [http://www.blackpeopleexist.org/foiled tinfoil hats]. There was also a messageboard (http://www.gigaloader.com/request/) which was a great place to spam up when domains start getting blacklisted.

==Scientology==
Due to [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY]], [[Scientology]].org has been gigaloaded [[OVER 9000]] times and because of some crap about somebody called Andy or something, it's been blacklisted from being gigaloaded. Fags. It is believed that over 99% of [[newfags]] didn't use a proxy and will probably get [[Rape|raped]] by [[Scientology|Xenu]].
