 Hello,
 &nbsp; 
 Most of you don't know me but who cares, right? I just felt like writing this. 
 &nbsp;
 Over the past few days I've been accused of hacking the servers, attacking
 Cyndre's home network and betrayal. I've been helping Psychic Doom for over a
 year now and I was still willing to help untill the welfare recipient, also
 known as Cyndre started accusing me of hacking his precious servers. He is now
 associating my name with everything that goes wrong on his network, even tho
 it's "internet" it still hurts me. As mentioned above, I put alot of time into
 Psychic Doom, why would I throw that all away? Cyndre has even threatened to sue
 me, I only have one thing to say about that... Be my guest. Just today, I saw
 Mystform entering the IRC channel and rant about how they need the donations
 to feed their children. Mystform; You and your so called "genious" think you can
 con 12 year old kids, therefor.. It's all your own damn fault, you deserve to
 be poor.

 For over a year I've spent most of my spare time on your shit, you think you
 can just use people and get rid of them as soon as you feel you don't need
 them anymore. No wonder you are on disability.. Someone probablu kicked the
 shit out of you when you tried to pull the same shit on them. You pulled the
 same shit on me as you pulled on Anti a few months ago, how can you possibly
 live with yourself? You are incapable of running a server and you abuse people
 to do it for you. Do you pay them? No. You have been promising me logs of my
 "hacks" and yet you fail to them to me or anyone else. You and I both know
 there are no such logs, hell.. you are too retarded to even know what logs are.  
 &nbsp;
 For the techies out there;
 &nbsp;
 The servers were down because cyndre edited /etc/pf.conf without any knowledge
 about firewalls and routing. He "accidently" routed his data to the wrong
 computers/servers and these on their turn crashed as they couldn't cope with
 it.  
 &nbsp;
 I will probably get a lifetime ban for this but hey, rules are there to be
 broken.
