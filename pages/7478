'''Shon Terry''' (Who the fuck names their kid "Shon"?!) is an [[cwc|autistic faggot]] on YouTube who is a marginally better singer than [[Nichole337]], [[earrape|and that's not something to be proud of]].  By how talented these two are, they might make a [[ugly|cute]] couple.  Just pray that they don't reproduce!  He has [[unwarranted self importance|3 different YouTube accounts of himself]], all of which combined have [[failure|less than 40 subscribers]].  He has claimed to be [[autistic]], and therefore [[lulz|you have no right to make fun of him.]]

Shon has a [[woman|whiny, effeminate voice]] and almost always has a [[emo|faggy]] hairstyle in his videos. He claims to have a [[retard|st-st-duh-uttering problem, probably from his alleged autism]]. He is also a [[gaymer|gamer]], and spends much of his free time [[fap|fapping]] to screenshots of [[World of Warcraft]] characters and the [[Jonas Brothers]].

==Things that Shon enjoys==
*Posting [[Nichole337|shitty vocal covers of shitty songs]].
*Posting videos of himself playing video games. Most of these videos (like his entire "Let's Play" series) have less than 100 views.
*Fapping to Halo 3 machinima.
*Fapping to Night Elves on [[World of Warcraft]].
*Fapping to [[you]].

==His YouTube Videos==
Shon's [[shit|musical tastes]] consists of: the [[Jonas Brothers]], [[Dragonforce]], and [[Breaking Benjamin]].  Here are a few videos from Shon's worthy-to-shittastic collection.

==Lost in Time==
On May 29th, 2010, Shon uploaded a new video of himself singing to "Lost in Time" by [[shit|With Man Comes Massacre]]. The video was a contest entry, of which a grand total of [[idiots|2 people submitted entries]].  Shon was delighted when his video was selected as the [[loser|winner of the two entries.]]

=="WTFRokerz versus Gays"==
Sometime [[Last Thursday]], Shon posted 3 videos of himself arguing with a random [[beaner]] over Xbox Live. Apparently, said beaner insulted Shon's imaginary girlfriend and spouted other random insults you'd hear from a typical [[13-year-old boy]]. Shon [[bawww|retaliated]] by [[irony|repeating that the beaner was gay]] throughout all 3 videos. Watching all of three videos in succession is a guaranteed way of killing several hundred brain cells. However, Part 2 is the lulziest of the three: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9qW3rwJuds

[[tl;dr]] It's hilarious how easily one can [[troll]] Shon.
