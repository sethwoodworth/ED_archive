Operation LazarusTV
{{Potential}}

{{moar|objective writing and less [[personal army]] bullshit}}

A simple request hit /b/. Bring back a television show, preferably a shite one, to prove to the world that we can still effect their lives and make them shit their pants like little girls. Essentially this is all we want to do. The history will be documented, the lulz captured and the plan will be kept a fucking secret so that no TV company sniffs out the idea.

==The Show==
The show in question will not be mentioned by name, it will henceforth be referred to as '''"The Show"''' from this point forward. '''"The Show"''' was decided by a group of Anons because it is a prime target, it was both shite and popular. How it managed this no one knows. All we can confirm at this time is tell you that it will be re-aired for one night only.

==The Plan==
===Step One: The Resurrection===
The plan is simple, even a newfag could pull it off.
* Find and join the IRC channel
* In the IRC channel ask what '''"The Show"''' is
* Rumours should be posted in the following places:
* Enter forums and fan pages and post stuff
* Find the actors and ask them if the show is coming back on Twitter, Facebook etc.
* Let as many people as possible know about the return of the show
* YouTube videos of '''"The Show"''' and comment about its return

This is the NON-PROFIT part of the operation and will take some work

All you need to do is create a hype for '''"The Show"''' preferably amongst fans of the show. This mean going on to forums and making a post declaring that '''"The Show"''' is coming back for a Thanksgiving special. All we do is throw a match on to the sticks and twigs and shit and leaves, and then whoosh... the fans will do the rest. We then need enough support and backing from the anons to prepare for Stage 2 and to guide the fans like sheep towards key areas to target.

These key areas include: the actors', directors' and writers' Twitter feeds will need to filled with questions about the rumours. Asking them if the show is really coming back. Hopefully some people will cotton on to this and start asking. Double hopefully some news corps will see this and catch on and maybe put some pressure on them.

===Step Two: The Burial===
After the show airs, we bury it. We do exactly what we did in Step One, but with acidic vile hatred towards the show. Calling it the worst thing ever on television, that the actors are tired, that the show should have ended the way it did before and that it's a travesty.

This can be pre-empted by not watching '''"The Show"''' when it airs.
