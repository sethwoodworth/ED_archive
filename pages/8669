Under Construction
[[Image:Under_Construction_1.gif]]

If something (usually a website) is '''under cronstruction''', it usually means that its creator is too [[lazy]] to put any content on it. This is often accompanied by a banner or picture of some sort saying "under construction", because [[nobody]] on the [[internet]] has the attention span to read text that isn't accompanied by some kind of [[porn]].

=Websites that are under construction=

*[[Wikipedia]] is technically under construction at all times, since it can never really be finished. It is one of the few under construction websites that ever has anything added to it. Unfortunately, everything that's added makes it suck [[moar]].
*[[MySpace]] is clearly under construction, because [[Lies | no finished product could ever be so terrible]].
*[[7chan]] is currently under construction due to an FBI raid. Let it be known, CP = Party V&.
