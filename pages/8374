They see me rollin'
[[Image:They see me rollin'.jpg|thumb|[[Typical]] example of this meme in use.]]
'''They see me rollin'... They hatin'''' is another textual [[meme]] which has been floating around on teh [[chan]]s for some time now. It takes its name from the lyrics of a Chamillioniare song which the author of this [[article]] has not heard because he does not listen to shitty [[rap]] music or whatever the fuck Chamillionaire is. This textual meme takes its form in various [[image macro]]s and [[demotivators]], often featuring [[retarded]] children like [[Juliana Wetmore]], [[cat]]s or [[fat]] people on motorbikes or wheelchairs (hence the "see me rollin'" part) which is considered to be their version of [[Pimp My Ride|riding on their pimpmobile]]. It is assumed that the "they hatin'" part refers to either [[discrimination]] against them, or jealousy, although why one would be jealous of them remains a [[mystery]]. 

The meme has been shaved down to just rolling, but it has been seen in the form of rollin, rawlin, rooolin, and rolla, along with whatever the moron posting thinks is lulz, which is stupid because the whole thing is completely retarded. if you see this word, it is a sign nothing interesting is happening and you should just leave. Now people have been slapping it on on other subjects,so rather then it saying '''rollin''' the pic would end with another word ending in '''ing''', but without the G.

Do a [[Google]] image search for the phrase and you'll find that most of the shit related to this phrase that originated in [[4chan]] has now been stolen and put on [[Ebaumsworld]]. [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] in turn is stealing these images from Ebaumsworld [[for great justice]].
