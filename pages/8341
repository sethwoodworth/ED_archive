[[YouTube]] is a home to not only [[shit]] videos, but also shit people and communities. These communities either have groups of their own on the site, or are just given [[YouTube Super Fags|collective titles by outsiders]] to group them together easier. The subject of this article is based on the latter. Enter The Youtube Thomas Club, a thriving, previously undiscovered garden of potential trolling and [[lulz]]. The community is mainly made up of [[Chris chan|man-children]], [[13 year old boys]], and [[16 year old girls]] that apparently [[Masturbate|jack off]] to Thomas the Tank Engine. Like all youtube communities based around a children's franchise, the members can [[Aspies|get easily offended]]. If you give their work [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|anything less than 5 stars]], it will lead to a shitstorm that will last months.

==The basics==
The Youtube Thomas Club is a collective term for the various [[Retards|interesting individuals]] of youtube that still watch a show they should have grown out of when they were 7, and have a tendency to make crappy videos in tribute to it. They usually stick together tightly in their little online community because they have no friends [[IRL]]. They are rather quiet and often keep to themselves compared to say the [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] fanbase, which are very much [[Batshit crazy|vocal]] and tend to breed nutters like [[Alix Henriol]]. However, like the Sonic fanbase, it is not difficult to troll these individuals and produce some quick lulz.

==Their videos==
With the invention of [[Windows Movie Maker]], even complete dumbasses can make videos. This is evident by the sheer amount of shit produced by these kids and uploaded for other equally thick people to see. There are 7 main types of video that they make:

===The tribute/music video===
The most common and easiest type of video for Thomas Club members to make. These will most often consist of either slides of stolen pictures, or clips from Thomas and Friends, often coupled with with shitty pop songs such as [[Gay|'Life is a Highway']] and other shit aimed at the [[High School Musical]] crowd. Failing to get any decent quality footage, these kids will settle on [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|recording episodes off their TV screen using their $10 webcam]].

===The episode reenactment===
A popular genre that these kids practically orgasm over. These are made by the uploader simply playing with their train toys in their mother's [[Basement|living room]] while having an episode playing on the TV in the background to create the sound. Very little is done in terms of proper editing, but that does not matter. [[Retards]] will give it 5 stars no matter what the quality is.

===The fan episode===
Take the above, except replace audio from the TV with audio of the fucktard uploading the video, mumbling their own horseshit [[fanfic]] that is most likely [[Truth|a carbon copy of an existing story except with some name changes]], and even when it is not it still sucks.

===The redub===
These kids just love adding to the shit pile on YouTube that most people call redubs. The sound is usually ass, the quality of the footage is grainy, and listening to kids (and occasional man-child) trying to imitate their favourite characters is just sad.

===The series and voice roles===
As if the episode reenactment wasn't bad enough, they have to create their own retarded series that consists of other users "auditioning" for shitty things they call voice roles. They do this by recording themselves trying to talk like one of the trains. If the fucktard accepts  their terrible voice, they use it for their stupid series that no one cares about. The sad part is that they think they are successful actors.

Believe it or not, they will do lines for anything.

===Thomas/Cartoon Crossovers===

As if the never ending shitpile from the Thomas youtube club wasn't enough. Some fags steal ideas from cartoons then combine them with Thomas The Tank Engine and noobs actually laugh at this sort of shit . It's bad enough some of these dumbasses still like Thomas never mind the thought of them having an orgasm over a video that contains no original humor. No wonder some cartoons are not that funny anymore because their jokes have been reduced to being used in shitty Thomas Cartoon [[crossovers]].

===Thomas Parodys===

Yet another waste of cyberspace. Noobs in the Thomas Community will typically take a couple of scenes from a cartoon or a Pizza Hut commercial with Ringo Starr and the Monkees and have Thomas audio in the background or vice versa. A lot of this shit is poorly done and most use the same clip over and over again and a lot of the time the same clip is repeated over and over again in the same scene with poor editing which is very sloppy looking; even the most oblivious cannot fail to see the shitty quality in a lot of these parody's; oh wait yes they can.....

==Their undying [[Homosexuality|friendship]] for one another==
The members of this group will not only make videos dedicated to Thomas, but they will also dedicate them to their [[Stupid|friends]]. Most often, these videos will either be one of the above genres, or something that otherwise still revolves around Thomas in some shape or form. For example, the below video is of a manchild showing the viewers around his basement full of Thomas toys in dedication to one of his idiot friends.

{{quote|My mom is going to order me ... d-mmm ... do-get hef-the second Henry's [[Goatse|tunnel]] on eBay.|A 20-something year old man on the topic of getting his [[Whore|mother]] to [[Loser|order him a wooden toy railway accessory]]}}

As well as making asses out of themselves on camera, they may also create [[OC|recolours]] of already existing characters to represent their friends.

{{quote|dude your a relly pice of work if you think all his Eils friends are redards no of them areï»¿ and you got a lot of never saying that|[[Fag|Silveralexgamer123]] pathetically trying to defend the maker of the above video}}

Despite their affection for each other, they do not seem to give helpful advice for one another on how to improve the quality of their videos, choosing instead to hold circlejerks over them, and if you question this, you get into trouble.

==Easy trolling==
Like all retards on the internet, they are very docile things at first, but as soon as you say anything that is not 100% praise, [[Batshit Insane|they turn on you and get nasty]]. [[Some argue]] that they are like this because their hugboxes are either broken, or they never had them in the first place.

A typical response to receiving a one star rating or critical comment from someone that does not like their work is usually to throw a temper tantrum and get his/her fellow retards to flame the hell out of whoever was not swallowing his/her terrible work like it was [[2girls1cup|chocolate]].

These kids also get very stroppy if you steal their [[Lie|hard work]] or emulate it in a certain way, since they are [[aspies]], and often claim copyright even though they are using someone else's characters/story/etc. This was evident when [[BLACKbusterCritic]] started archiving the events of the Thomas community for [[Trolling|reference material]].

<youtube>IKPmqB6aIck</youtube>

Some members often see this sort of stuff coming, and put a pathetic little notice at the beginning of their videos, saying they will sue [[you]] if you steal their video/idea. It it advised that [[Anonymous]] steal the videos with these sort of warnings on them, edit and re-upload them, and watch as the little kid on the other side of the internet tries to hire an [[e-lawyer]] for his case.

Note the first part of the above video, and you will find Thomas Fags are extremely butthurt after their page blanking was reversed.

Make your own Thomas "parody" using dialoge from an adult-oriented movie or TV show, something [[you]] like, which Thomas fans would never touch with a 10 foot pole

==BRWS Competition Faggotry==
[[Last Thursday|One day]], a YouTube Partner by the name of Simierski thought that he'd be able to weed out the 7% of the YouTube Thomas community that wasn't retarded by doing a social experiment. For this, he set the community a challenge of creating an [[Original Character|original character]], that was actually somewhat original, for his model train series that [[Nobody Cares|no one else gives a fuck about]]. He would then give out prizes to the people that actually did their research on the topic of making a character that would fit into a series about steam engines in 1950's Britain. [[Sarcasm|Amazingly]], even the most basic of instructions were ignored, and over 90% of the entries fucked up on at least one of the requirements, if not all of them. Some even stole characters from other sources, including Thomas.

<center>{{fv|id|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold; |<youtube>c3M5c570yM4</youtube>|<youtube>9lLz0upJ02s</youtube>}}</center>

After the winners had been chosen, alot of the inbred morons who made completely crap entries started crying about the whole ordeal, even going as far as to [[WTF|draw their creations crying]].

==How to spot a Youtube Thomas Club Member==
It is fairly easy to spot one of these lurking in a friends list or in a comments box. Here are some pointers:
*May try to show off in comments by posting [[Shit nobody cares about|useless railway trivia]].
*May have a channel avatar that relates to or includes Thomas.
*Has a list of friends and foes in the description box of his/her profile.
*Has channel rules in same description box, mostly along the lines of "NO BAD COMMENTS OR [[Pussy|I BLOCK YOU!]]".
*Will most likely list Thomas and the Magic Railroad as a favourite movie even though it is shit.
*Will be friends with loads of other YT Thomas Club fucktards.
*Will always have at least one video of a shitty slideshow dedicated to either their favourite character out of the show or [[Original character]] bullshit.
*Will often cry if you downvote their videos for lulz.
*[[???]]
*[[PROFIT]]!

=="Normal" Thomas fans VS Youtube Thomas fans==
Small children make up a majority of the norms of course, but there are a select few nostalgia fags, who pride themselves on being like an exclusive club on Sodor Island Forums. Despite its [[communism|extreme censorship]] and slighty [[Tim Buckley|dodgy staff]], they believe that being a member of this message board makes them better than their [[Basement-dweller|Youtube-dwelling brederin]]. [[Wat| Even though a lot of their own members think that the inclusion of female steam engines in a show that's not even marketed towards them is an afront to their childhoods]], making the rivalry between SiF and YouTube, basically a [[Unwarranted_Self-Importance|Snobs]] vs [[Sick Fuck|Slobs]] slagging match.

As a result of being [[Owned|shown up]] by SIF, the Youtube Thomas Club constantly have [[Oh noes|hissy fits]] about them and make [[H8|hate videos]] to try and stop people from joining their forums. Of course they fail most of the time because none of creators of the videos can develop solid arguments for shit, and just fall back on [[BAWWWW|"DEY B& ME CUZ DEY DIDNT LIEK ME! :("]] and [[MS Paint]] edits. A fine example was made by [http://uk.youtube.com/user/MichaelGeorgeHartley MichaelGeorgeHartley], who suffered [[butthurt|anal pains]] when he got banned from SIF, most likely for being a [[dumbass|fucking idiot]].

{{quote|They generally slag off the videos and their creators on the forum, calling them [[noobs|n00bs]], which, [[Bullshit|if we change a few letters around]], becomes [[PINGAS|nob]], which is a shortened variation of knob end| [[LOL WUT]]}}
It's like I'm really watching [[FOX News]]!
