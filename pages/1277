CSI
''Not to be confused with [[CSIII]]''

'''''CSI''''' (for Crime Scene Investigation) is a TV show that comes in three flavors, all of them cheese; ''[[CSI]]'' (set in [[Vegas]]), ''[[Miami|CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[NYC|CSI: New York]]''. Contrary to popular belief, two thirds of the three shows are made of pwn and lulz, the exception being '''''CSI: New York''''', which is devoid of anything that could even be considered 'acting', drama or lulz despite the presence of [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/ Lieutenant Dan].

Highlights include watching David "[[Hansen|Horatio]] ([[INAM]]) Caine" Caruso keep putting his sunglasses back on (whilst he's never been seen removing them) and [[tubgirl|relentless torrents]] of unfunny [[anti-lulz|'zingers']] that are so horribly [[FAIL]] they actually [[WIN]] (see [[Rules of the Internet]]).

However, it is the original '''''CSI''''' (Vegas) that delivers the most, having shone the spotlight on such abhorrent human perversions such as [[furries]], [[infantilism]], [[vampires]] and [[Awesome|Nazi-style experiments involving lobotomizing homeless people]].

{{Quote|Who the hell knows what goes on in a furpile?|Catherine Willows}}

In essence though, they are '[[boring|procedural dramas]]' where wannabe cops catch sloppy criminals through the likes of [[DNA]] from [[cum]] stains and skin cells then make them confess with highly [[drama]]tic dialogue under dim lighting while Horatio completes all the tough sleuthing work by looking through his eyebrows at people and speaking really quietly so his voice sounds deep.

==Notable Episodes==

===Fur & Loathing - The [[Furry]] Episode===
[[lulz|One notorious episode]] featured a [[furry]] who had been [[drugs|drugged]], [[NRA|shot]], then [[lol|run over by a truck]], as well as explaining the definition of the word "[[yiff]]" to the viewers watching when the episode aired on October 30, 2003. Also, this particular episode makes it quite clear that groups of furries are always engaging in yiff orgies in the back of [[Convention|furry conventions]]. This resulted in thousands of furries across the internet ranting about [[bullshit|this injustice and how the episode showed them in a bad way.]] Fortunately no furries complained about it in [[RL]] as they were too embarrassed to show themselves. Also, as a note of lulz and graet justice, the killer wasn't punished. BALEETED!!!!

===The [[Second Life]] Episode===
