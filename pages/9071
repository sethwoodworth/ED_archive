'''Wikitruth''' is a [[dead]] website once dedicated to exposing the awful [[truth]] about dirty [[Wikipedophile]]s.  Demise notwithstanding, any newcomer to the sport of kicking [[Wikipedia]] to [[death]] would have loved to read the articles there as an element of their preparatory education. Their [http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Special%3AAllpages&from=uncensored&namespace=0 collection of old and pre-censoring versions of Wikipedia "articles"] was once unsurpassed.  Bear in mind, however, that each and every Wikitruth editor was a [[batshit insane]] [[Nazi]] [[fucktard]] who was originally [[banned]] from [[Wikipedia]] for levels of sheer [[faggotry]] [[impossible|beyond even the scope of TOW]].

==History==
Wikitruth was a [[Wiki]] but [[New User Registration#Closed Registration -- Wikitruth|only for a very small group of bores who absolutely did not want you signing up for it]]. The site said that [[Wikipedia]] was a pile of [[Pelican Shit|pelican shit]] and that [[Jimbo Wales]] and all the other [[retard]]ed editors (e.g. [[MONGO]]) were a gang of dictators who ruled the wonderful world of Wikipedia. Now who could believe that? 

Over the few months when the site had some semblance of life, it also accumulated twenty or so original articles worth reading at least once. Then on February 5, 2009, it was locked down. [http://wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Goodbye]

Then in October 2010, [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=31017 the wiki closed down for good].


And then Wikipedia Review learned that [[Wikipedia:User:Silensor]] is the one who founded the site.  He was never an administrator and quit editing in 2007.

[[Image:Wikitruth poses with Jimbo Wales.jpg|thumb|500px|right|Wikitruth's peak moment is conclusive proof Wikitruth is run by teh [[cabal]] zOMG!]]

The site was supposedly run by a bunch of [[butthurt]] editors from Wikipedia who were probably kicked off for being bores. Before they all [[died]], [[Jimbo Wales]] claimed that "they are probably all [[troll]]s banned by Wikipedia" and "the site is a hoax" in spite of the fact that some articles on Wikitruth could only have been obtained by a Wikipedia administrator or the most compulsive watcher-and-copier or [[cache]] seeker. Now that the site is long [[dead]] and [[Wikipedia]] provides more [[drama]] every few weeks than Wikitruth's original articles ever covered, it looks like [[Jimbo]] might have had some inside knowledge when he called it a hoax. 

The '''very few''' and '''very inactive''' ([[dead]]?) users all have stupid names:
*Badlysketchedbob - in all the ways that [[Badlydrawnjeff]] was a good name, this one is complete [[fail]].
*Bob Johannsen 
*Brass tacks 
*Buttafuoco 
*Climbing Jack 
*D3str0y ‎(Bot) 
*Grammarbitch 
*Hightimes 
*Honeycomb Hideout 
*Jachin 
*KITTYLOAF 
*Kira 
*Lane ‎(Bot) 
*Leper Messiah 
*Mastigoteuthis flamea 
*Nibbler ‎(Bureaucrat, Sysop) - some lame conspiracy name 
*Nittygritty ‎(Bot) 
*Seek ‎(Bureaucrat, Sysop) 
*Will.i.am.tell (Bureaucrat, Sysop) - a dumb play on words

There were any guidelines on how to register as a member to be able to edit the Wikitruth wiki. This is presumably decided through some other form of interaction.
