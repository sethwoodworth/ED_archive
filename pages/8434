'''Tinal''' has been known to hang around members of [[Bantown]] and the Old [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] crew. As a result he attempts to command respect from others because of it, and sometimes he may get it from a newbie but [[fail|more often than not he just gets a response along the lines of: "lol k".]] He requires attention to live and gained notoriety for pwning 420chan's servers.

===Tinal on 420chan===

Tinal is one of the head moderators at [[420chan]] and a total [[fag|faggot]]. [[No one likes you|Everybody fucking hates him]], except the [[newfags]] who always think Tinal is [[awesome|the shit]] at first and that [[feem]] is just shit. Their opinions of both people reverse within a week or so because Tinal just isn't capable of not acting like a [[aspergers|retard]] for more than that amount of time. Whether it's saying something incredibly fucking stupid and then [[YHBT|claiming to be trolling]] when he realizes what an asshat he is being, or if it's [[ITG|threatening]] to [[K-line|g-line]] someone for simply disagreeing with his opinion. Anyone who has known Tinal for a relatively short amount of time will realize that he is a complete and utter [[fucktard]]. 

===Tinal? A [[gay|Gay]] [[Transvestite|Gender Confused]] [[furry|Furry?]]===

[[Last Thursday]] Tinal posted and stickied a thread in [[420chan|420chan's]] [[/b/]] asking all 420channers from [[California]] to [[homophobe|vote yes on Prop 8 and re-ban gay marriage.]]Some of the more naive channers dismissed it as [[troll|trolling]] but others who knew of Tinal's past [[faggotry]] knew he was being [[serious business|serious.]]
[[Image:AntiGayBingo.gif|right|thumb|The guide Tinal used to make his [[fail|infallible]] arguments against gay marriage.]]

This thread of course started an argument in the 420chan IRC channel which led to Tinal bitching about gay marriage. Some dismissed him as trolling and trolled right along with him. Some took him seriously and either argued with him or ignored him because [[nobody cares|they didn't really care.]] Most of those who said they voted "no" on Prop 8 were G-lined by Tinal and called "fag lovers"

The argument however sloped into whether Tinal was trolling or not. [[truth|Tinal repeatedly insisted that he was not trolling]] yet others still accused him of being a troll, either because they believed he was trolling or to simply troll him. Tinal went to great lengths to prove he wasn't trolling by making [[stupid|convincing]] arguments and typing in [[all caps|all caps.]]

Eventually his frustration with people not taking him seriously led him to admitting that he once had a boyfriend and with the power of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], he [[ex gay|de-gayed himself.]] Despite this, some people still persisted in calling him a troll and as a result he also admitted that he once was a furry and he gave up a link to a [[LiveJournal]] account called '''Catgirl-Ninja''' and claimed it was his.

With a little googlework on "Catgirl-Ninja" it was also found that Tinal had a [[SheezyArt]] account as well. The plot thickens. 

By now it should established that everybody at this point knew that Tinal was indeed serious, yet some still persisted in calling him a troll to see if he would say anything more... 
and he did.

He admitted to having chatlogs leftover from [[cyber|cybering]] with other furries. One of the people trolling him managed to squeeze a chatlog out of Tinal before getting G-lined.

[[Image:Tinal fursona.gif|left|thumb|Tinal's fursona. [[weaboo|AWWW KAWAII NEKO DESU ^__^]]]]

Looking through his [[SheezyArt|SA]] account, it's obvious that Tinal's desire to ban gay marriage in a state that isn't even in his fucking country is not out of logic, but out of an attempt to run away from his gay furry past. His gallery, a pile of [[photoshop|shoopage]], was skimmed through and his [[fursona]] was found along with a bunch of journals which have content with hazardously high faggotry levels. Read at your own risk.
