==An Introduction to Fail==

{{quote|Of all the mutilations of the English language that have surfaced on the Internet, the abuse of the word "fail" would surely count as one of the very worst.  The word "fail" was originally a verb, so grammatically correct use would be "I am worried that I am going to fail the test."  However, its usage has changed over the years, as internet users of various web forums began using it as a noun, referring to something as being "full of fail," as an adjective, such as saying, "This is fail," or even as a general exclamation of disgust by saying quite simply, "FAIL."|-Some [[Grammar Nazi|douchebag]] providing an example of fail}}

The [[meme]] (YOU FAIL IT) [[shit nobody cares about|originates from the arcade game Blazing Star.]]  Of all the game's obvious draws — among them fast-paced action, disco music, and [[animu]]-style cut scenes — its staying power comes from its [[Engrish|wonderfully terrible Japanese-to-English translations]]. If you beat a level, the screen flashes with the words: "You beat it! Your skill is great!" If you lose, you are mocked: "You fail it! Your skill is not enough! See you next time! Bye bye!"

==Epic Fail==
[[Image:Epicfail.jpg|thumb|Read this [[Omegle]] conversation for an example of an epic fail at trolling.]]

Any epic fail is a fail so incredibly bad that it paradoxically becomes a win. You cannot try to get an epic fail, because that would just be trying to attain a win. And then you would be [[trying too hard]].

It is important to distinguish between garden-variety fail and epic fail. For example:

Fail: Driving your car into a tree.

Epic fail: Crashing the Hindenberg into the Titanic because you got distracted by a Detroit Lions game on laserdisc.

== The fail/win paradox ==
Is a [[paradox]] created by [[hippies|deep thinkers]] constructed to create a failed [[Mindfuck]]. It simply puts a goal to "fail", and then asks if said test subject succeeded in achieving that fail. If the goal were to fail, and [[you]] failed in failing, then you achieved your goal to fail, thereby winning. If you achieved the fail you set out to achieve, that would be considered a win - the only logical outcome is to win when the goal is to fail. But even if [[you]] [[win]], you're still [[retarded]] for trying.

== Fail...==

Is in fact not quite that hard to accomplish. To fail, you must simply be unworthy to [[win]].
