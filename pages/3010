'''To the delight''' of [[basement dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[weaboo]] [[fags]] everywhere, another shit [[PS3]] game from [[Japan]] comes into their greedy, Dorito and chocolate-stained hands. It wasn't that hyped, but the few that bothered to buy it were taken into a [[drugs|magical world]] of [[Swirlface|monsters]] and other such WTFery. One of those games celebrated for having a [[shit|deep]] story line full of [[rape|mystery]] and [[Goatse|intrigue]]. Let's take a look.

*<b>[[Mary Sue|Ellen]]:</b> some [[blonde]] with your typical [[Japanese]] [[animu]] face. Is 22 years old, but as it's a Japanese game, she looks closer to their legal sexin' age so the designers all had something to fap to whilst weeping over their small [[cock|penises]] and [[you|lack of lives]]. If that's not enough, you see some cutscenes of her when she was actually [[loli|young]], most of which she's [[Pedobear|locked in a cave]] under some Henge, [[rape|crying and scared]]. She has [[orphan|no parents]], has [[over 9000]] costumes in the game, and has a tight little arse that gamers fantasize about while they [[masturbate|dirty their tube socks]]. If Ellen's not [[Liberalism|bitching]] about finding her mother, she's busy taking it [[asking_for_it|up the ass]] from Keats in the Faery Realm. A deer head on a wall hits on her in the game. Srsly.


*<b>Keats:</b> a reporter who doesn't really exist, but you don't find this out until the end of the game, and it makes for a shitastic ending. He's actually Herve, the kid who [[sex|took Ellen's virginity]] when they were kids, then [[an hero|gave up his life]] to save her when she went all [[emo]] and [[almost_died|almost]] bled to death. He was dying from a fatal [[STD]] anyways, so he figured he'd rather die than have to pay a [[lawlsuit]]. Herve was obsessed with some [[Science_fiction|Sci-Fi]] [[nerd]] magazine called The Unknown Realm, so [[epic_fail|he grew up in the Netherworld to look like a pic Ellen drew of him to work for a magazine that went out of print years ago]]. Keats has a purple trench coat which he uses to conceal [[loldongs|himself]], then [[screamer|flash]] little girls like the barman's youngest daughter, wears [[fag|very tight pants]], and constantly looks like he belongs at a [[grunge]] concert. Ellen's guardian but [[too_lazy|never actually protects]] her.


*<b>[[Nobody_cares|Suzette:]]</b> an angst-ridden bitch. Her life was ruined because her [[orphan|family members all died]] and went [[batshit insane]], and she blames Ellen for it. She likes to [[banned_IRL|kill]] people.


*<b>Scarecrow:</b> an extremely [[queer]] Half Life who looks like... a scarecrow. Imaginative. Was created from Ellen's [[lust|desire]] to spread the joys of [[sex|getting laid]] unto the [[IRL|real world's]] people, and so at the end of the game he goes [[DBZ]], morphs into a giant piece of [[shit]] with beaks and wings, and attempts to [[Evangelion|rape the entire world]]. [[Fails]] utterly when Keats [[STFU|bitchslaps]] him and Ellen [[owned|beats]] the living shit out of him with her <strike>Pokemon</strike> [[penis|Folks]].


*<b>Livane:</b> an [[old]] lady who looks young, but has been isolated for so long that her [[ass]] and [[cunt]] have fused together and formed a [[Pain_Series|bony growth]] over them, much like an over-aged female turkey. She used to be a Messenger like Ellen, but she learned that the Faerys were in charge of a tree that was making it so people weren't [[scared_kitty|afraid]] to die, which let them [[lulz|fight wars and kill each other for no reason]]. Livane decided to [[lulzkiller|kill the Faery's lulz]] and stab the tree with her giant pointed [[dildo]], making people afraid to die. She continues to lead a resistance against the Faery King. She told young Ellen that if she [[emo|cut herself]], she could save Herve from his [[STD]], thus causing Herve's [[quit_IRL|death]] and almost causing Ellen's. [[troll|Many lulz were had]].


*<b>Belgae:</b> an invisible [[book|bookfag]] who guides Keats and works as Livane's [[bondage|sex slave]]. That said, he's had nothing to surprise rape with his invisibility for some time, and so became a homosexual. Is a Half Life, but used to be Livane's [[the_Giver|Guardian]], like Keats is for Ellen. He and Livane tell Keats [[pussy-whipped|what to do and where to go]] in the game.


*<b>Faery King:</b> an oldfag who rules the Faerys. He tried and failed to get Livane's ass into his bed, and so he looks for a new Messenger ass slave to do his bidding. Tells Ellen that she'll find her mom in the Netherworld if she keeps running around defeating monsters and giving him blowjobs. She never actually does find her there, though.


*<b>NPCs Nobody Cares About:</b> In Doolin, there's a bunch of people that no one really pays attention to. The hag, whose name we never learn, but is Ellen's mother and is [[Portal|ALIVE]]. And old couple, the Lesters. Mr. Lester is a [[rapist|doctor]] who tried to cure Herve, but realized that [[sick_fuck|fucking him up the ass]] and contracting the virus himself wasn't helping. He experienced [[troll's remorse]], but Suzette [[pwnt]] him, but his wife survived. The Lighthouse keeper, Ryan, who was pwnt by the hag. A washed up, bitter actress in a wheelchair named Harriet who [[Harry_Potter|always wears black]]; she gets [[murder|killed]] by Suzette. She originally sent Ryan to get pwnt [[I_did_it_for_the_lulz|for the lulz]]. O'Connell, who went [[insane]] when he lost his girlfriend, Ingrid. He hypnotises Ellen later to make her give him a [[rimjob]] [[/b/|while he tapes it]].

Herve is Suzette's [[Thats_not_funny%2C_my_brother_died_that_way|brother]]. He dies before she's born. Heraldo is Suzatte's [[father]]. The hag kills him before she's born. Regine is Suzette's [[mother]]. She goes [[crazy|fucking nuts]], [[violence|beats Suzette]] every day just for existing [[Truth|like any good parent]], and sends a letter to Ellen to lure her to Doolin to [[headshot|kill]] her. [[Irony|The hag kills her before the game starts]]. There's also the Pub owner, who has a daughter named Fiona and a loli named Charlotte who can see Half Lives. They have [[you|nothing]] to do with the story.


*<b>Half Lives Nobody Cares About:</b> Every night, a bunch of [[goth|half-alive freaks]] break into the local pub, turn on all the lights, and [[party]]. Of course everyone is too [[stupid]] to notice anything. There's a skeleton named Charlie with a sax he can't play because he doesn't have lungs, some eyeless pig thing with horns named Jimmy Squarefoot who has a [[erection|hardon]] for a banshee named Frizzie. There's also [[fat|Damona]], who has a pet [[Sonic|hedgehog]], and some [[furry|rat in a coat]]. They all just sit around [[beer|drinking]] unless they want you to [[gangbang|do something]] for them. In which case you talk to the giant pipe-smoking hairy [[penis]] behind the bar named Ganconer.

<b>Summary:</b> You play as Ellen and Keats, but all the characters suck.

==Story & Gameplay==


Ellen goes to Doolin looking for her [[dead]] [[mother]] because she got a letter from her, but is too [[woman|female]] and [[blonde]] to realize that [[Silent Hill|dead people can't send letters]]. Keats gets a phone call from some [[bitch]] in Doolin who says Faerys are going to kill her. He thinks it'll make a [[lulz|lulzy]] story, so he goes, too. They meet on a cliff where a [[gravity|lady falls from the cliff]]. Ellen passes out, then [[drug|vividly hallucinates]] about a [[schizo|voice]] telling her to go to the pub. If the voices in your head are telling you to go out at 3am to get hammered, [[common_sense|you naturally listen to them]]. She meets a talking scarecrow who tells her to [[rape|go underground with him]].
[[Image:Folklore_Pouke.jpg|thumb|right|110px|[[Lie|Folklore is an excellent game with wonderful and creative characters]].]]

Meanwhile, Keats is sitting in the [[hole]] he was given to sleep in, [[marajuana|smoking something]] really good. He hears a voice telling him to go to the pub. He wanders dazedly to the pub, meets an invisible [[fag]], and goes underground, too. Ellen [[necrophilia|screws]] a dead body and absorbs [[herpes|something]] that becomes some [[what|new clothes]]; the Cloak of [[fail|Sidhe]], that allows her to [[fellatio|suck the souls]] from men and [[beastiality|animals]] the way [[loli]] and [[shota]] sucks the souls of millions of [[basement-dwellers]] worldwide. Keats, who is watching from a distance, thinks this is hawt and starts [[fap|fapping]] furiously until he releases some [[cum|special white energy]] that makes him [[Arnold_Schwarzenegger|all powerful]]. Belgae just says, "ur her guardian, [[lol|lolz]]".

Gameplay includes:
* [[Jameth|Giving it and taking it in the ass]].
* Raping Ellen [[at_least_100|at least 100]] times.
* Flashing [[lolis]] and [[midget|small people]].
* [[???]]
* [[Profit|PROFIT!!!]]

From here, it's just a load of more [[bullshit]]. Ellen meets the Faery King, and Keats meets [[lesbian|Livane]]. They both tell you to go and kill this big ass monster called a Folklore to [[lolwut|find out some shit from some bugs]], but they only want you to do it so they can make it back to the [[faggotry|tree]] with Livane's barbed [[dildo]] stuck in it. You go around beating the shit out of things from a bad Final Fantasy [[fanfiction]] (Folks), sucking out their souls and forcing them to fight for you. The game says they used to be human souls, making the game extremely [[furry]].

{{quote|Poor pacing becomes a primary issue, followed by annoyingly long boss battles, the occasionally frustrating soul-sucking mechanism, repetitive gameplay, lots of backtracking (I thought we were done with that in the 90's), a boring plot, and lots of other little features that collectively keep Game Republic's latest project from reaching the quality [[gamer|gamers]] expect from a PS3-exclusive.|Shiva Stella from GameBump, wanking about the shit gameplay and loading times.}}

==WTF==
After you complete a chapter with one character, they give you the option of running through the [[nerd_rage|exact same chapter]] with the other one, but from a slightly different perspective. Ellen and Keats get different [[Pokemon]] to use with different abilities, ranging from [[BDSM]] and chloroform to beatings and [[rape]]. If you'd rather not alternate between the two, forcing them to perform [[fellatio]] on each other, you can just play as one until near the end of the game. Then you have to complete the other character's story up to the same point. Most sane people would become [[an hero]] for playing this, or just smash the system before this point, but no one owns a [[PS3]].

[[Shit nobody cares about|Though it takes place in "Doolin", the village was originally "Limerick", but the Japanese pronounced it "Lemrick". They changed the name to reduce the global trolling it would cause]]. Lol, [[Japan|Japanese]].
