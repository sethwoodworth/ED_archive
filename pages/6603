Prince Jeremy/Chat logs
Back to [[Prince Jeremy|Originating article]].

This article is really fucking [[tl;dr]]. In summation, this nigger furry wanted to remove things, got b&, got lured into an arbchat by another EDiot, failed at arbchat (piss-poor negotiation tactics), tried to baleet fucking everything, and got b& again. A few weeks later he is lured back into yet another arbchat by same troll, lulz ensue, and now has an outstanding debt of 800 IRL dollars in legal fees. Then the ex-furry MelkiahFox was able to drag him back in and make more lulz for the channel. The logs are lulzy, but before you continue, grab a beer and take a piss, 'cause this is one lolcow that never dries up.

[10:39] <tfo> if you enjoy never winning
[10:39] <zionistacat> approaching the discussion as a debate, to be won or lost, is your first mistake

[10:45] * DukeOtterland has joined #arbchat
[10:45] <DukeOtterland> Hi.
[10:45] <DukeOtterland> Sorry I lost my temper.
[10:45] <DukeOtterland> Let's try this again.
[10:45] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: it's ok
[10:45] <DukeOtterland> I'm sorry I got upset.
[10:46] <zionistacat> we understand it's stressful for you.
[10:46] <weev> Its understandable. Must have a lot of pent up rage having to explain to 
your parents why you wear diapers.
[10:46] <DukeOtterland> Yes, now please tell me if there's anything sensible I can do to 
get that article removed, toned down, or removed from Google.
[10:46] <weev> yes
[10:46] <weev> You can do a pice of furry art
[10:46] <bleep> photos of you in diapers with a sign saying "I have been trolled by Bantown"
[10:46] <januszeal> removed from google?
[10:46] <januszeal> jp;k'
[10:46] <weev> that says "I haev been trolled by bantown"
[10:46] <DukeOtterland> ...
[10:46] <weev> and also take a picture of yourself
[10:46] <DukeOtterland> That's far from sensible.
[10:46] <CRYRAPESOCK> Suing LJ would be sensible in this situation.
[10:46] <weev> holding a paper sign that says it
[10:46] <weev> also
[10:46] <DukeOtterland> Can't you just act like normal human beings?
[10:47] <weev> you can make a small donation to me
[10:47] <weev> for my time
[10:47] <TiCL> hey give him abreak
[10:47] <DukeOtterland> Yes, please.
[10:47] <weev> in filling out the removal paperwork
[10:47] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: I think you should maybe 
watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9mTWGP-Ce0
[10:47] <zionistacat> it may help you understand a little more about ED
[10:47] <TiCL> that's a good video
[10:47] <DukeOtterland> Okay...
[10:48] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: what, exactly, are your issues with your article?
[10:48] <DrainageCat> I'm here to demand more pictures of cats. Please comply.
[10:48] <DrainageCat> That is all.
[10:48] * DrainageCat has left #arbchat
[10:48] <DukeOtterland> Yes, I know some of the stuff actually occurred in LJ...
[10:48] <weev> yeah
[10:48] <weev> you could always sue them
[10:48] <DukeOtterland> But my issue is that the article is *inflammatory*.
[10:48] <DukeOtterland> I actually don't have any objections to the article being up at all...
[10:49] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: what, exactly, do you want?
[10:49] <DukeOtterland> I do have objections to the article showing up so high in Google.
[10:49] <TiCL> DukeOtterland: that's your fault
[10:49] <DukeOtterland> For my article to be at least removed from Google searches.
[10:49] <DukeOtterland> How so?
[10:49] <weev> DukeOtterland: what do you expect? ED has huge pagerank because millions of people read it.
[10:49] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: we have no way of adjusting google's search rank
[10:49] <weev> your websites are crap that noone cares about
[10:49] <weev> therefore, ED is higher up on google
[10:49] <TiCL> you couldn't make your own page good enough to be at the top
[10:49] <Jewkemia> lern SEO furfag!
[10:49] <TiCL> I suggest you copy the article and put it in your website
[10:49] <DukeOtterland> By the way, that video doesn't work.
[10:50] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: contrary to popular opinion, ED has no affiliation 
with Google, despite both having a secret cat cabal
[10:50] <Jewkemia> lol
[10:50] <weev> you could pay google
[10:50] <weev> for ads
[10:50] <Jewkemia> not to mention the whole jew thing
[10:50] <zionistacat> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9mTWGP-Ce0
[10:50] <weev> that feature your website as a sponsored website
[10:50] <weev> for 'dukeotterland'
[10:50] <januszeal> lol
[10:50] <Jewkemia> yea, like anyone else with a fucking business would
[10:50] <zionistacat> you could pay ED to advertise your web site
[10:50] <weev> or you could just pay me and make the IHBT BY BANTOWN pictures
[10:50] <TiCL> that's a cool idea
[10:50] <weev> and your article will come down
[10:50] <DukeOtterland> I'm not sleeping in bed with my enemies.
[10:51] <Jewkemia> iawtc
[10:51] <TiCL> then get raped
[10:51] <Jewkemia> lol
[10:51] <DukeOtterland> Why does the video take forever to load?
[10:51] <bleep> Believe me, I woulnd't want to be in bed with someone who wears diapers recreationally
[10:51] <zionistacat> enemy is such a negative way of looking at it
[10:51] <weev> bleep: so both DukeOtterland and darkcube are out?
[10:51] <Jewkemia> no, but i'd do ya behind the dumpster at dennys, if it made you cry a little
[10:51] <wattage> Neutral adversary.
[10:51] <bleep> weev: yeah
[10:51] <DukeOtterland> It's also negative to post all that nasty stuff about me.
[10:51] <zionistacat> i prefer to think of us as conflict enhancers
[10:51] <Jewkemia> no, but i'd do ya behind the dumpster at dennys, if it made you cry a little\
[10:51] <weev> bleep: darkcube has massive tits tho
[10:51] <bleep> weev: HOT!
[10:52] <bleep> weev: darkcube has a dungeon too :O
[10:52] <zionistacat> wattage: yeah, but neutral.
[10:52] <januszeal> lol
[10:52] <bleep> idiftl
[10:52] <Jewkemia> actually, we are the harbingers of Justice!
[10:52] <weev> neutrality? in my dramaticas?
[10:52] <bleep> Internet Justice
[10:52] <weev> its more likely than you think.
[10:52] <Jewkemia> lol
[10:52] <zionistacat> lol weev <3
[10:53] <wattage> <3
[10:53] <zionistacat> is neutrality the same as not giving a shit?
[10:53] <Jewkemia> no
[10:53] <weev> it might be
[10:53] <januszeal> brb
[10:53] <weev> cause i dont give a shit about DukeOtterland 
[10:53] <bleep> I just find his page lol
[10:53] <DukeOtterland> If you don't give a shit about me then you can take down that article.
[10:53] <weev> or his stupid 'your article violates copyright law' shit
[10:53] <weev> DukeOtterland: like i said
[10:53] <Jewkemia> what say you, duke of otterland?
[10:53] <weev> draw the art
[10:53] <weev> take the picture
[10:53] <DukeOtterland> Well, you are technically breaking the law.

[10:53] <weev> DukeOtterland: oh yeah?
[10:53] <Jewkemia> NO U!
[10:53] <weev> cite the law we're breaking
[10:53] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: we document lulz and drama
[10:53] <DukeOtterland> How can I trust you?
[10:53] <weev> i assure you
[10:53] <bleep> DukeOtterland: then take us to court
[10:53] <weev> ED has a lawyer
[10:53] <weev> that makes like
[10:53] <weev> 1mil+ a year
[10:54] <zionistacat> and you make lol drama
[10:54] <weev> and specializes in copyright law
[10:54] * januszeal has quit IRC (Quit: bai bai #ed ilu all :D�)
[10:54] <bleep> If you sued ED you would just create more lulz
[10:54] <bleep> Especially as your deviant sex life became part of public record
[10:54] <weev> man
[10:54] <bleep> I wonder how your parents would feel about that
[10:54] <weev> that would be hilariously awesome
[10:54] <DukeOtterland> How exactly did you view the Friends-only posts I made in babyfur and smart_furs?
[10:54] <weev> DukeOtterland: yes please sue us
[10:54] <bleep> I bet they'd disown you
[10:54] <TiCL> DukeOtterland: you can make your page rank higher by linking back to ED
[10:54] <Jewkemia> we are, of course, all attourneys at lols, registered and everything
[10:54] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: did you watch the video, it clarifies some of the 
subtleties of ED that I think you have missed.
[10:54] <DukeOtterland> The video won't freaking load.
[10:55] <DukeOtterland> oh, there it goes.
[10:55] <Jewkemia> try it again, this time without failing
[10:55] <weev> DukeOtterland: jameth has an exemption created by LJ to let that account 
view every post on LJ

[11:01] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: srsly, we cannot help our page rank or our placement in 
google's search results. Buy an ad on your page if that's your issue.

[11:01] <DrainageCat> why don't you like your page?
[11:01] <bleep> And getting nuked on the last day != good
[11:01] <zionistacat> i know
[11:01] <zionistacat> i'm hurt
[11:01] <zionistacat> we made it a good page too
[11:01] <DukeOtterland> Because it paints a very negative picture of me.
[11:01] <DrainageCat> how so?
[11:01] <DrainageCat> lol
[11:01] <bleep> ED pages only call the shots as they are
[11:01] <weev> DukeOtterland: perhaps its because you are a worthless person
[11:01] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: it paints an accurate picture
[11:01] <bleep> There is no spin with ED
[11:02] <DukeOtterland> Yes, there it.
[11:02] <bleep> It's like a photograph
[11:02] <DukeOtterland> *is
[11:02] <bleep> A photograph doesn't change what is in it
[11:02] <weev> okay
[11:02] <zionistacat> no, there is not. because we don't care
[11:02] <bleep> It simply captures it.
[11:02] <weev> DukeOtterland: haev you not purchased a fursuit?
[11:02] <bleep> So we took a photograph of you
[11:02] <weev> DukeOtterland: have you not worn a diaper?
[11:02] <DukeOtterland> Yes, I have purchased a fursuit and experimented with diapers.
[11:02] <DukeOtterland> But that's my business.
[11:02] <TiCL> loooool
[11:02] <weev> not when you put it on the internet!
[11:02] <bleep> Except it is on the Internet
[11:03] <weev> it becomes the internet's business
[11:03] <zionistacat> then how did it come to be on the internet?
[11:03] <t12> and as we all know
[11:03] <DrainageCat> Did your experiments cure any diseases?
[11:03] <weev> if you wanted to keep it your business, then you should have kept it to yourself
[11:03] <t12> the internet is SERIOUS business
[11:03] <DukeOtterland> Well, I posted Friends-only posts in LiveJournal...
[11:03] <DukeOtterland> But apparently someone at ED managed to get snapshots...
[11:03] <DrainageCat> but we're your friends.
[11:03] <weev> DukeOtterland: �what have you learned?
[11:03] <zionistacat> obviously you should be a little more discriminating in who your friends are
[11:03] <TiCL> e-betrayal
[11:03] <Jewkemia> and remember, the internet is SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS
[11:04] <bleep> YETH
[11:04] <zionistacat> srsly srs
[11:04] <t12> doublesrs
[11:04] <weev> DukeOtterland: this is pointless if you have not learned anything
[11:04] <weev> what have you learned?
[11:04] <Jewkemia> have you at least learned somethin here?
[11:04] <weev> well, pointless for you. quite lol for us.
[11:04] <DukeOtterland> I've learned that it's folly to fight you people.
[11:04] <DrainageCat> Also, "Duke" is not a proper title for an American citizen.
[11:04] <zionistacat> oh, that was a given
[11:04] <DukeOtterland> My title is fictional.
[11:05] <Jewkemia> Also, cocks.
[11:05] <weev> thats funny. you signed a "legal" copyright notice with it
[11:05] <weev> that was super lol
[11:05] <zionistacat> DrainageCat: that's ok cause Otterland is imaginary

[11:07] <TheRightHonorableEdLolington> hear ye hear ye
[11:07] <DrainageCat> Maybe when Otterland's communist dictatorship is overthrow 
you'll be re-installed as a sort of unifying figurehead while the constitution is written
[11:07] <bleep> And your future employers will read about it
[11:07] <DrainageCat> like Karzai

[11:08] <bleep> They must be ashamed
[11:08] <weev> he told them he wears the diapers to test out for when he gets his fursuit.
[11:08] <TheRightHonorableEdLolington> someone should find his parents and make sure they know
[11:08] <TheRightHonorableEdLolington> all day
[11:08] <TheRightHonorableEdLolington> and night
[11:08] <TiCL> DukeOtterland: how do you live with yourself?

[11:08] * DrainageCat is now known as Barrett
[11:09] * TheRightHonorableEdLolington is now known as Sundays_Mail
[11:09] <bleep> Perhaps we should get in touch with Jeremy's parents

be seen by thousands of furfags every day
[11:12] <zionistacat> i know
[11:13] <zionistacat> thats what i'm telling him
[11:13] <Sundays_Mail> it might be deflaming yourself, but if you want your shitty book to sell...
[11:13] <zionistacat> as far as marketing, we are the most affordable option when it comes to 
reaching his target audience
[11:13] <DukeOtterland> bleep: For your information, I'm not fat.
[11:13] <TiCL> iawtc
[11:13] <Sundays_Mail> true story
[11:13] <bleep> Haha
[11:14] <bleep> The only one he responds to is what I say
[11:14] <zionistacat> DukeOtterland: plus, a link back from ED could also increase the 
rank of your own pages, as srscat pointed out
[11:14] <Sundays_Mail> a rediculous amount of ediots are also furfags and cosplayers 
and shit amirite?
[11:14] <bleep> So that means he's insecure about his appearance
[11:14] <zionistacat> bleep: if you were a skinny white boy from texas that wanted 
to be a purple otter in diapers, wouldn't you be?
[11:14] <bleep> DukeOtterland: have you ever touched a girl?

[11:15] <zionistacat> I thought you were saving yourself for marriage?
[11:15] <wattage> Tell us the story of the first time you lost your innocence
[11:15] <DukeOtterland> I'm a virgin.
[11:15] <bleep> Haha
[11:15] <zionistacat> oh.

[11:15] <zionistacat> ah, we see. they didn't die
[11:15] <weev> DukeOtterland: tell us how you masturbate with plastic bags and crisco
[11:15] <weev> you pathetic fucking loser

[11:16] <DukeOtterland> I'm actually enjoying this.
[11:16] <bleep> Likewise.
[11:16] <DukeOtterland> I do masturbate often, though.
[11:16] <zionistacat> TiCL: that is a remarkably apt question
[11:16] <bleep> I am glad that I have a job, a wife and don't wear diapers
[11:16] <DukeOtterland> I'm glad I don't act like you people do in real life.
[11:16] <Sundays_Mail> lol, i'm just glad i dont wear dipers
[11:16] <DukeOtterland> For your information, I liked wearing diapers.

[13:06] dukeotterland124: Thanks for telling me this.
[13:06] dukeotterland124: And I toned down the article.
[13:06] Jewkemia: yea, blanking it probably isnt the best idea; that 
gets noticed
[13:06] dukeotterland124: *nods*
[13:09] Jewkemia: so it looks like a little comprimise is the solution 
after all, huh?
[13:10] dukeotterland124: yes
[13:10] dukeotterland124: thanks
[13:10] Jewkemia: just glad to see that jokes can be made without 
people getting too pissed

[13:11] Jewkemia: it's all a part of being e-famous, you know?
[13:11] dukeotterland124: yeah
[13:11] Jewkemia: ya gotta give a little, but that doesnt mean you 
gotta give too much
[13:11] dukeotterland124: i'll just try not to piss off anyone online 
anymore.
[13:11] Jewkemia: well, you have reason to get pissed, that article was 
pretty deflamatory
[13:12] dukeotterland124: indeed
[13:12] Jewkemia: and it did violate your copyrights
[13:12] dukeotterland124: yeah
[13:12] Jewkemia: but I'm glad to see a comprimise could be made
[13:14] Jewkemia: (Link:

nobodys and sock for pullin this kinda shit
[13:17] dukeotterland124: Well, I really don't konw how to get into 
contact with admins...
[13:17] dukeotterland124: And usually they've been asinine.
[13:17] Jewkemia: just look for the kewlkids and leave messages on 
their talk pages
[13:18] Jewkemia: if they let you back in, then they probably dont care 
anymore
[13:18] Jewkemia: [about being asinine]
[13:19] dukeotterland124: Where can I find the kewlkids?
[13:19] Jewkemia: i'm looking for the link now

[13:23] dukeotterland124: okay
[13:23] Jewkemia: there's usually someone on there from the admin list
[13:23] dukeotterland124: okay
[13:23] Jewkemia: they have little @ signs next to their names
[13:23] dukeotterland124: k
[13:23] Jewkemia: do you have the address?
[13:24] dukeotterland124: No.

[13:24] Jewkemia: go to the #ED room, and ask to schedule an arbchat
[13:26] dukeotterland124: Sheesh, are all the admins like that in IRC?
[13:26] Jewkemia: like what?
[13:26] dukeotterland124: Complete idiots.
[13:26] Jewkemia: complete EDiots.
[13:26] Jewkemia: but how?
[13:26] Jewkemia: what happend?
[13:26] dukeotterland124: Well, all talk idiotically and such..
[13:26] Jewkemia: oh

[13:27] dukeotterland124: yeah
[13:27] Jewkemia: did you get your arbchat?

[13:39] dukeotterland124: Huh?
[13:39] dukeotterland124: Nothing.
[13:39] Jewkemia: nothing?
[13:40] dukeotterland124: Well, it's futile to debate those idiots.
[13:40] Jewkemia: do you have the logs?
[13:40] Jewkemia: how bad was it?
[13:40] dukeotterland124: Fuck...
[13:40] dukeotterland124: No.
[13:40] dukeotterland124: How do I log
[13:40] dukeotterland124: How do I log?
[13:40] Jewkemia: it depends on your client
[13:41] Jewkemia: or you can just cuntpaste them into notepad
[13:41] dukeotterland124: What would you do with them?
[13:41] Jewkemia: i just wanna see how it went
[13:41] dukeotterland124: What could you do?
[13:41] Jewkemia: did you lose your temper?
[13:41] Jewkemia: not much
[13:41] dukeotterland124: Sort of...
[13:41] Jewkemia: i can give you advice
[13:41] Jewkemia: but htat's the best
[13:41] dukeotterland124: ...
[13:42] Jewkemia: that's your first mistake
[13:42] dukeotterland124: Can I at least get it removed from Google 
searching?
[13:42] dukeotterland124: The article?
[13:42] Jewkemia: if you control google, or if you can play by their 
rules long enough to get them to do it
[13:42] dukeotterland124: Well, they insist on a lot of bullshit such 
as "apologizing for being a faggot" and such...
[13:43] Jewkemia: was that before or after you lost your temper
[13:43] Jewkemia: ?
[13:43] dukeotterland124: probably after
[13:43] Jewkemia: ok
[13:43] Jewkemia: cool down, then try again. start off with an appology 
for gettting upset so quick, that'll disarm them
[13:44] Jewkemia: remember, dont give up. eventually they wil get bored 
and cave
[13:55] Jewkemia: how's it coming along for you?
[13:55] dukeotterland124: Not very well, I'll Notepad it.
[13:55] Jewkemia: cool, then send it to me
[13:56] Jewkemia: just tell them you'll do whatever they want, if 
they'll calm down and act rationally
[13:58] Jewkemia: have they agreed?
[13:59] dukeotterland124: To what?
[13:59] dukeotterland124: No.
[13:59] dukeotterland124: I'm logging the chat now.
[13:59] Jewkemia: act reasonable
[13:59] Jewkemia: ok
[13:59] dukeotterland124: Yes, I am.
[13:59] Jewkemia: just keep talking to them, eventually they'll start 
to like you a bit more
[14:00] Jewkemia: o, I was clarifying that i meant to ask if they were  
acting reasonable
[14:00] dukeotterland124: Hardly.
[14:00] Jewkemia: yea, just try not to do anything to make them mad, 
then theyll get bored and give in
[14:07] Jewkemia: anything?
[14:07] dukeotterland124: I'm trying to get the text file uploaded
[14:07] Jewkemia: are they calming down?

[14:13] dukeotterland124: okay
[14:14] Jewkemia: but remember it's just the internet. you cant control 
it
[14:16] Jewkemia: wow, that is a bit rough
[14:16] dukeotterland124: What can I do about it?
[14:16] Jewkemia: id just keep trying to reason. persistence always 
wins
[14:16] dukeotterland124: Really?

[18:47] x Marks the kW: it was in the wiki article
[18:48] dukeotterland124: ...
[18:48] x Marks the kW: but they didnt have a link to your book
[18:48] x Marks the kW: so i figured i'd try this
[18:48] dukeotterland124: What kind of article was it?
[18:48] x Marks the kW: it was pretty funny,, kinda mean, but like in a good humor kinda way
[18:48] dukeotterland124: ...
[18:48] x Marks the kW: you know?
[18:49] dukeotterland124: So it *was* ED...
[18:49] x Marks the kW: maybe

[18:49] dukeotterland124: I'm familiar with the site.
[18:49] x Marks the kW: yea
[18:49] x Marks the kW: its pretty funny
[18:49] dukeotterland124: Well yeah, some of it's funny, but when they launch personal attacks against furries...
[18:50] x Marks the kW: everyone fursecutes
[18:50] x Marks the kW: its nothing that even wikifur hasnt done
[18:50] x Marks the kW: is it?
[18:50] x Marks the kW: how personal was it?
[18:50] dukeotterland124: *shrugs*
[18:50] x Marks the kW: anyway
[18:51] x Marks the kW: i found your article and i liked the sample chapter and the fanart
[18:51] dukeotterland124: Uh, thanks.
[18:51] x Marks the kW: which book is thatfrom?
[18:51] dukeotterland124: I guess.
[18:51] dukeotterland124: Well, you can read the samples at the Lulu site I gave you.
[18:51] x Marks the kW: you said you have two
[18:51] dukeotterland124: Probably Org's Odyssey.
[18:51] x Marks the kW: ok
[18:51] dukeotterland124: They're both linked.
[18:51] dukeotterland124: My storefront link again is (Link: http://www.lulu.com/dukeotterland)http://www.lulu.com/dukeotterland
[18:52] x Marks the kW: is that asgard like the tree?
[18:52] dukeotterland124: ?
[18:52] x Marks the kW: i always liked vikings
[18:52] dukeotterland124: Yggdrasil is the tree.
[18:53] x Marks the kW: right
[18:53] dukeotterland124: My books are rooted in Norse mythology.
[18:53] x Marks the kW: ok
[18:53] x Marks the kW: that's probably why i liked your style
[18:53] dukeotterland124: I'm surprised that ED article gave you a *positive* impression of me...
[18:53] dukeotterland124: If you aren't joking.
[18:53] x Marks the kW: its funny
[18:53] dukeotterland124: You're serious?
[18:53] dukeotterland124: ...
[18:53] x Marks the kW: they do that even with the admins
[18:53] dukeotterland124: I see.
[18:53] x Marks the kW: it didnt seem too harmful
[18:53] dukeotterland124: Well, I actually lost some friends because of that article...
[18:53] x Marks the kW: ?
[18:54] x Marks the kW: then they probably werent your friends
[18:54] dukeotterland124: On LiveJournal
[18:54] x Marks the kW: and besides
[18:54] x Marks the kW: if the article is too harsh, you can always tone it down
[18:54] x Marks the kW: its a wiki
[18:54] dukeotterland124: I actually wanted that ED article removed, but the admins 

seem like complete idiots...
[18:54] dukeotterland124: No, they revert it.
[18:54] dukeotterland124: And banned me.
[18:54] dukeotterland124: Fighting them is futile.
[18:54] dukeotterland124: So I might as well bear that Scarlet Letter.
[18:54] x Marks the kW: did you blank it? i got banned from wikipedia for that once
[18:55] dukeotterland124: No matter how much I even tried to tone the article down they kept reverting it and 
ultimately banned me for repeatedly editing it...
[18:55] dukeotterland124: So I've just given up.
[18:55] x Marks the kW: did you try writing to the admins?
[18:56] x Marks the kW: maybe they thought you were a vandal or something
[18:56] dukeotterland124: I told you, I talked to the admins, but they're complete retards.
[18:56] x Marks the kW: but im sure if you let them know its you and you hint at the 
possibility of legal action they'll tone it down
[18:56] dukeotterland124: Oh no, I don't want to go there.
[18:56] x Marks the kW: dont outright say it
[18:56] dukeotterland124: Just forget it.
[18:56] x Marks the kW: well, if it makes you feel any better, it's not too mean
[18:57] dukeotterland124: Just don't mention it.
[18:57] x Marks the kW: but if it bothers you, you should do somethign
[18:57] dukeotterland124: Well, but do keep an interest in my books.
[18:57] dukeotterland124: No.
[18:57] dukeotterland124: I just wanna forget it.
[18:57] dukeotterland124: So don't mention it again.
[18:57] x Marks the kW: does it bother you?
[18:57] dukeotterland124: Forget it!
[18:57] x Marks the kW: im sorry
[18:57] dukeotterland124: ...
[18:57] dukeotterland124: The more I try to fight them, the worse the article becomes, 
so just forget it and don't even mention it again.
[18:57] x Marks the kW: ok
[18:57] dukeotterland124: But do keep an interest in my book if you want.
[18:58] x Marks the kW: do you want me to take care of it for you?
[18:58] x Marks the kW: i will

4:17:50 PM***#arbchat You need voice (+v) (#arbchat)
4:17:50 PM <weev> Why do you think you deserve to get treated differently than all the other trollees?
4:18:03 PM*** <weev>  has voiced hep
4:18:06 PM <DukeOtterland> I'm not asking for special treatment.
4:18:09 PM <DukeOtterland> And I'm not a troll.
4:18:11 PM <weev> yes you are.
4:18:15 PM <weev> i said trollee not troll
4:18:17 PM <OldDirtyBtard> -> <weev> : +v plz
4:18:20 PM <weev> i would not do you the respect of calling you a troll
4:18:27 PM <weev> now listen
4:18:32 PM <weev> we have an informal removal process
4:18:41 PM <weev> but frankly i don't feel like filing the paperwork
4:18:43 PM <weev> it is a lot of work
4:18:53 PM <weev> but if you pay me $600 for my time then i will make it happen.
4:19:07 PM <DukeOtterland> That's extortion again.
4:19:10 PM <DukeOtterland> Isn't it, X?
4:19:11 PM <weev> $700.
4:19:19 PM <tehdely> you should pay him; it really expedites things
4:19:30 PM <DukeOtterland> I'm not paying a cent.
4:19:48 PM*** <weev>  has removed the “moderated” room mode
4:19:51 PM <weev> alright
4:19:55 PM <weev> the offer stays on the table at $700
4:19:56 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> this isnt working
4:19:57 PM <qurve> There is no relevant case law to support your extortion claim.
4:20:01 PM <weev> does the jury feel this is reasonable?
4:20:07 PM <Blargh> aye
4:20:09 PM <tehdely> yes
4:20:13 PM <qurve> aye
4:20:15 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> the duke will not pay extorion monis
4:20:15 PMLOAGaye
4:20:16 PM <OldDirtyBtard> i think its fair
4:20:30 PM <OldDirtyBtard> its not extortion
4:20:30 PM <YagamiLight> aye
4:20:32 PM <qurve> The true question Duke is under what premise said images should be removed?
4:20:33 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> that's illegal and you can be arrested for it
4:20:38 PM <weev> so arrest me
4:20:39 PM <OldDirtyBtard> if you want something doing
4:20:43 PM <weev>  <X_Marks_the_kW> : its now $750
4:20:44 PM <OldDirtyBtard> you pay for the work
4:20:45 PM <qurve> "Because I want" is not a legal argument.
4:20:45 PM <weev> good job
4:20:51 PM <bleep> That my mom has and will be in Oklahoma for the few days 
and that my dad goes to work most of the day has given me a rare opportunity to 
cub out more often. I still have plenty of Molicares, and I went through one today, 
having taken it off just recently.
4:20:56 PM <Jewkemia> lol raise it again
4:20:56 PM <bleep> Wha the fuck is wrong with you
4:21:04 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> duke
4:21:07 PM <DukeOtterland> Yes?
4:21:10 PM <bleep> Man, you're the type of person we bring back to the agency and 
beat with a rubber hose
4:21:24 PM <weev> you're not paying for the removal, you're paying for my time to 
give you special treatment and file the paperwork
4:21:26 PM <weev> fyi
4:21:28 PM <bleep> And dump you naked in the middle of a bad section of town.
4:21:33 PM <OldDirtyBtard> do i hear $800?
4:21:37 PM <OldDirtyBtard> time is money
4:21:52 PM <DukeOtterland> I want that article removed or I'll call federal authorities.
4:21:53 PM <OldDirtyBtard> we all have work to do
4:21:56 PM <OldDirtyBtard> hahahha
4:22:00 PM <qurve> Duke, under what premise?
4:22:00 PM <OldDirtyBtard> party van
4:22:10 PM <weev> 19:21 <+ <DukeOtterland> > I want that article removed or I'll call federal authorities.
4:22:13 PM <weev> $800
4:22:13 PM <weev> for sure
4:22:14 PM <bleep>  <DukeOtterland> : I can give you the number to contact
4:22:17 PM <qurve> They will tell you it is fair use.
4:22:25 PM <bleep>  <DukeOtterland> : But you'll be getting me or one of my friends.
4:22:33 PMckeu <DukeOtterland>  i'm sure federal authorities will like you a lot 
once they see your "art"
4:22:35 PM <weev>  <DukeOtterland> : lisetn dude
4:22:36 PM <bleep> And as I said, we take your type out to the agency and beat 
you with a rubber hose.
4:22:38 PM <OldDirtyBtard> duke: i think the feds have al qaeda to get to first
4:22:40 PM <weev> we have a staff of 3 lawyers
4:22:40 PM <qurve> And then you will be on federal record making a complaint for beastiality artwork.
4:22:41 PM <weev> for ED
4:22:43 PM <DukeOtterland> Explain fair use, please.
4:22:45 PM <qurve> Which will end up in a file.
4:22:47 PM <weev> if you think that we don't know copyright law
4:22:51 PM <weev>  <DukeOtterland> : i already fuckin pasted it to you
4:22:52 PM <DukeOtterland> It's not bestiality artwork.
4:22:53 PM <weev> in the last arbchat
4:22:58 PM <Jewkemia> i need a beer
4:23:00 PM <Jewkemia> brb
4:23:02 PM <weev> you can google it your retarded self this time
4:23:05 PM <qurve> Duke, it is animals engaged in sexual acts.
4:23:09 PM <weev> google: "fair use" copyright
4:23:14 PM <tehdely> i need to finish wiping
4:23:16 PM <qurve> While legal, it will go into a permanent federal file.
4:23:19 PM <weev> and you'll find out lots about copyright law
4:23:24 PM <tehdely> this shit is taking forever
4:23:25 PM <weev> that you obviously do not currently understand
4:23:42 PM <weev> listen i offered you a way
4:23:51 PM <DukeOtterland> If you don't know what fair use is why are you hiding behind it?
4:23:51 PM <weev> to get the article taken down that would be alot cheaper for you than litigating
4:23:52 PM <qurve> The federal authorities keep databases of such things similar 
to any other potential criminal watch list.
4:23:56 PM <weev> and you fuckin acted like a little insolent bitch
4:24:01 PM <weev> so you know what? its $300 extra now
4:24:10 PM <weev> dont like it? don't pay $800 and the article stays up forever
4:24:24 PM <weev>  <DukeOtterland> : I FUCKING PASTED YOU FAIR USE IN THE LAST ARBCHAT YOU STUPID AUTISTIC RETARD
4:24:31 PM <weev> YOU CAN DO YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH THIS TIME
4:24:32 PM <OldDirtyBtard> duke: you dont think we contend with this all the time?
4:24:49 PM <DukeOtterland> I don't believe my article falls under fair use because it's defamatory.
4:25:00 PM <qurve> It is critical, not defamatory.
4:25:05 PM <qurve> Everything in that article is factual.
4:25:07 PM <weev> AHA
4:25:09 PM <qurve> Unless you are claiming otherwise.
4:25:14 PM <weev> man
4:25:15 PM <OldDirtyBtard> we know "fair use" extremely well
4:25:16 PM <weev>  <DukeOtterland> : basically
4:25:20 PM <weev> here are your options
4:25:21 PM <weev> pay $800
4:25:27 PM <DukeOtterland> No, you are not using it for critical or scholastic purposes, 
you are using it for inflammatory uses.
4:25:29 PM <weev> or have your article stay up forever
4:25:31 PM <DukeOtterland> And I'm not paying any money again.
4:25:37 PM <weev> then you're fucked
4:25:39 PM <OldDirtyBtard> duke; SATIRE
4:25:42 PM <DukeOtterland> You're using it as hate propoganda, not fair use.
4:25:42 PM <weev> i'm personally making sure your article stays up forever
4:25:46 PM <qurve> inflammatory is subjective.
4:25:46 PM <weev> what are you gonna do about it? huh?
4:25:54 PM <DukeOtterland> You're not getting any money out of me.
4:25:55 PM <bleep>  <DukeOtterland> : why don't you get it over and sue us alreadyt
4:26:01 PM <qurve> It has no legal basis outside of direct threats of harm.
4:26:02 PM <DukeOtterland> You can't make me pay, I own that art.
4:26:05 PM <bleep> I mean, it won't get far... but you could at least try.
4:26:15 PM <DukeOtterland> Hate speech is illegal too.
4:26:16 PM <qurve> Duke, ED makes no claim that you do not own that art.
4:26:23 PM <weev> thats fine
4:26:26 PM <weev> then you're not getting any time out of me
4:26:32 PM <weev> and your article stays up
4:26:33 PM <qurve> ED however has a legal fair use right to use it for certain purposes such as criticism.
4:26:33 PM <weev> indefinitely
4:26:34 PM <Blargh> duke otterland if you pay $900 dollars we will keep the article but change it so that it is positive
4:26:35 PM <weev> until the end of time
4:26:42 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> im right here
4:26:50 PM <OldDirtyBtard> Duke: ED knows what we can and can't get away with
4:26:56 PM <bleep>  <DukeOtterland> : that isn't hate speech by any definition.
4:26:58 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> this is hate speech
4:27:00 PM <qurve> Hate speech is not illegal duke unless it contains direct threats.
4:27:08 PM <weev> basically
4:27:11 PM <bleep> Still isn't hate speech
4:27:12 PM <weev> any contradiction of me
4:27:13 PM <bleep> It is critical.
4:27:16 PM <weev> is going to make that $800
4:27:17 PM <X_Marks_the_kW>  this is not protected under fair use
4:27:17 PM <weev> just go up
4:27:17 PM <qurve> It is not hate speech regardless.
4:27:22 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> my dad is a lawyer

4:31:37 PM <qurve> You claim that ED is posting defamatory information about you, 
but you do not deny that everything in the article is factually correct.
4:31:40 PM <qurve> Yes or no.
4:31:44 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> he was admitted in 81
4:31:48 PM <DukeOtterland> It is correct, but the truth does hurt sometimes, does it not?
4:31:50 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> the first time
4:32:03 PM <qurve> So everything in the ED article is in fact truthful?
4:32:04 PM <DukeOtterland> Just because something is true doesn't mean it's right to post around the Internet.
4:32:07 PM <DukeOtterland> Yes.
4:32:14 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> that's right
4:32:15 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> also
4:32:18 PM <qurve> Ok, in that case it can not be legally defamatory or libelous.
4:32:21 PM <qurve> Because it is true.
4:32:25 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> this does not fall under fair use
4:32:30 PM <DukeOtterland> But it's inflammatory nonetheless.
4:32:31 PM <qurve> So ED has no culpability in that matter.
4:32:36 PM <qurve> That's one issue
4:32:40 PM <qurve> And is settled.
4:32:43 PM <qurve> Agreed?
4:32:50 PM <YagamiLight> agreed
4:32:56 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> this is similar to posting a judges home address online
4:33:03 PM <qurve> The content of the ED article is not defamatory or libelous
4:33:04 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> you can all go to ejail for that
4:33:09 PM <OldDirtyBtard> no it isnt
4:33:13 PMCyllene <X_Marks_the_kW> : So put us in jail.
4:33:15 PM <qurve> Duke, agreed?
4:33:16 PM <DukeOtterland> ejail?
4:33:23 PM <DukeOtterland> Agreed with what?
4:33:26 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> jail
4:33:28 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> sorry
4:33:30 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> typo
4:33:34 PM <qurve> That the content of the ED article is not defamatory or libelous.
4:33:40 PM <qurve> Because it is in fact true.
4:33:45 PM <DukeOtterland> No, I disagree.
4:33:47 PM <qurve> We must agree on that point first.
4:33:56 PM <DukeOtterland> Just because it's true doesn't mean it's not inflammatory.
4:33:59 PM <qurve> What is factually incorrect in the article?
4:33:59 PM <DukeOtterland> Agreed?
4:34:06 PM <qurve> I didn't say inflamatory, that is a seperate issue.
4:34:08 PM <Jewkemia> what i miss jews?
4:34:11 PM <qurve> We need to go through potential issues one at a time
4:34:12 PM <DukeOtterland> The article is true, but it's just plain tasteless.
4:34:19 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> and it's hatespeech
4:34:23 PM <Blargh> then you have no legal basis
4:34:24 PM <DukeOtterland> Indeed.
4:34:24 PM <qurve> For something to be defamatory or libelous it must be untrue.
4:34:32 PM <Blargh> it also must cost you money
4:34:35 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> tell them what bothers you about it
4:34:36 PM <DukeOtterland> ...
4:34:39 PM <qurve> So if the article is in fact factually accurate it can not by definition be defamatory.
4:34:44 PM <Blargh> since you hve no way of proving either
4:34:49 PM <Blargh> you cannot sue us
4:34:54 PM <DukeOtterland> The article bothers me because it features Friends-only posts I made in LiveJournal...
4:34:57 PMCyllene <Blargh> : You can sue anyone.
4:35:09 PM <DukeOtterland> And a comment I made in someone else's LiveJournal apparently reproduced without their permission.
4:35:09 PM <Blargh> cyllene: sue us and WIN
4:35:16 PM <qurve> The record reflects that you have previously agreed that while (in your opinion) 
distasteful, the article is in deed factually true.
4:35:21 PMCyllene <Blargh> : Right,  <DukeOtterland>  would never win against ED.
4:35:22 PM <qurve> Hence it can not be defamatory.
4:35:23 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> he can and he will
4:35:26 PM <qurve> Agreed Duke?
4:35:27 PM <DukeOtterland> It is harassment because it stalks actions I've taken in LiveJournal.
4:35:33 PM <DukeOtterland> What am I agreeing with?
4:35:37 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> exactly
4:35:41 PM <qurve> What I just said 10 times.
4:35:45 PMCyllene <X_Marks_the_kW> : Anyone can talk. Let's see you do something.
4:35:50 PM <DukeOtterland> It does defame me, so I disagree.
4:35:54 PM <qurve> The ED article is factually correct and by definition can not be defamatory as a result.
4:36:00 PM <DukeOtterland> Ever hear the expression "The truth can hurt"?
4:36:05 PM***Cyllene is now known as Vagina
4:36:07 PM <Blargh> no
4:36:08 PM <OldDirtyBtard> maybe i'll sue the duke for offending my sensibilities
4:36:11 PMVaginaheh
4:36:16 PM <DukeOtterland> ...
4:36:17 PM <Blargh> odb: yes
4:36:30 PM <qurve> duke
4:36:40 PM <DukeOtterland> The article uses my art without my permission.
4:36:46 PM <Blargh> duke i am suing you for emotional distress caused by looking at your disgusting furry bestiality porn
4:36:49 PM <OldDirtyBtard> i think the whole furry thing is dissgusting
4:36:51 PM <DukeOtterland> Whenever you post something online, it's already copyrighted.
4:36:54 PM <OldDirtyBtard> and unAmerican
4:36:56 PM <bleep> Hahah
4:36:57 PM <qurve> Duke, answer this question:
4:36:59 PM <bleep>  <DukeOtterland> : sue us
4:37:01 PM <bleep>  <DukeOtterland> : please
4:37:04 PM <qurve> Is the ED article factually accurate?
4:37:08 PM <bleep>  <DukeOtterland> : because you know what happens when you sue us?
4:37:11 PMckeu <OldDirtyBtard>  agreed.
4:37:15 PM <qurve> Without regard to whether you like the article.
4:37:16 PM <bleep>  <DukeOtterland> : your sexual deviance becomes a part of public record
4:37:19 PM <DukeOtterland> Well, it really crosses the line of good taste.
4:37:20 PM <qurve> Is it factually accurate?
4:37:22 PM <bleep> And people will search for you in the future
4:37:25 PM <qurve> good taste is not in question

4:37:36 PM <DukeOtterland> Every little thing on that article is inflammatory.
4:37:37 PM <bleep> And they will find you are a diaper-loving pervert
4:37:38 PM <bleep> And they will find you are a diaper-loving pervert
4:37:38 PM <qurve> IS THE ARTICLE FACTUALLY ACCURATE?

4:37:39 PM <DukeOtterland> You're breaking the law.
4:37:39 PM <qurve> IS THE ARTICLE FACTUALLY ACCURATE?
4:37:39 PM <bleep> And they will find you are a diaper-loving pervert
4:37:39 PM <OldDirtyBtard> nor are people who collect CP
4:37:39 PM <qurve> IS THE ARTICLE FACTUALLY ACCURATE?
4:37:45 PMckeu< <DukeOtterland> > I am not having sex with anyone! <--- thx for confessing
4:37:50 PM <qurve> It's a yes or no question duke
4:37:51 PM <DukeOtterland> Yes, but it is illegal to post private things on the internet!
4:37:52 PM <qurve> IS THE ARTICLE FACTUALLY ACCURATE?
4:37:52 PM <Jewkemia> lol
4:37:59 PM <bleep>  <DukeOtterland> : haahaha
4:38:04 PM <DukeOtterland> Yes, but that doesn't make it right to post online.
4:38:04 PM <bleep> That's the most pathetic thing I've ever heard
4:38:09 PM <qurve> duke follow along with me here
4:38:09 PM <bleep> Anyways, sue us plz
4:38:13 PM <bleep> That's all I'm asking
4:38:13 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> he's got a case here
4:38:16 PM <qurve> YOu agree the article is factually accurate, correct?
4:38:17 PM <DukeOtterland> Thanks.
4:38:23 PM <bleep> Because I want your perversion to become a part of public record.
4:38:29 PM <bleep> And your life will be ruined.
4:38:32 PM <DukeOtterland> I agree completely, but again, THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT TO POST ONLINE!
4:38:35 PM <qurve> DUke
4:38:37 PM <qurve> the act of defaming; false or unjustified injury of the good reputation of another, as by slander or libel; calumny
4:38:41 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> can we plz discuss what it is that we want removed, and how we can agree on how to remove it?
4:38:43 PM <bleep> Because a lot of companies do heavy background searches
4:38:44 PM <DukeOtterland> You ARE injuring my reputation.
4:38:44 PM <qurve> That is the definition of defamation
4:38:47 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> can we plz discuss what it is that we want removed, and how we can agree on how to remove it?
4:38:48 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> can we plz discuss what it is that we want removed, and how we can agree on how to remove it?
4:38:49 PM <DukeOtterland> I want all pictures removed.
4:38:49 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> can we plz discuss what it is that we want removed, and how we can agree on how to remove it?
4:38:51 PM <OldDirtyBtard> by admitting it's all accurate, you have just ruined any chance of a lawl suit
4:38:54 PM <qurve> So by definition the article is not defamatory agreed?
4:38:55 PM <DukeOtterland> You can keep the words, but take down all the pictures.
4:39:00 PM <DukeOtterland> I disagree.
4:39:00 PM <qurve> Once you agree to that we can move on to other issues
4:39:09 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> any pictures of him invade his privacys
4:39:11 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> -s
4:39:18 PM <DukeOtterland> Thank you.
4:39:23 PM <qurve> Duke, you have the attention span of a fucking 2 year old.

4:39:34 PM <X_Marks_the_kW> he could
4:39:34 PM <qurve> We can't arbchat if you can't hold a conversation.
4:39:46 PM <qurve> And answer simple questions.
4:39:46 PM <DukeOtterland> Yes, for violating my privacy.
4:39:50 PM <Blargh> duke how accurate are our fanarts of you
