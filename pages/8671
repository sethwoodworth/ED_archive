Underground Forum
{{watch}}

[[Image:dattco931.jpg|frame|right|'Online Martial Arts Community']][http://www.mma.tv/TUF The Underground Forum] (TUF) is the Internet's biggest online martial arts community.  The forum supports the sport of Mixed Martial Arts [[Mantrain|(MMA)]] fandom, grappling, UFC and other sports, which [[John McCain]] once said are akin to [[Large Penis Support Group|human cockfighting]].  However, we all know they are serious win, ''amirite''?

The forum was created in [[last thursday|1998]] and has grown to accommodate hundreds of thousands of users and [[homosexual]]s. The forum itself has a certain underground feel to it as it supports criminals, violence and men in tights who [[buttsecks|'wrassle']].


== The architecture of TUF ==

TUF is made up of various subforums.  The most trafficked forums however are the TUF itself and the Otherground (OG) forum.  Other forums include International forums, So called [[Expert]] Q&A's and General Martial Art forums. The OG forum prides itself on not talking about MMA fandom; however, much drama still ensues since they are the paragon of [[you|MMA fagdom]].

== TUF Culture ==
[[Image:GameSpot.gif|frame|right|TUF forum has many similarities to GameSpot]]
Users names are separated into different colors so as to befit the apartheid like atmosphere of the forum. Professional Fighters, who have nothing better to do than hang out on line and talk shit to toddlers, are green.  Green is a good choice as it is the color of the snot beaten out of the fighters since none of them are good at fighting; just talking about it. Because of the high level of testosterone involved in being a real [[internet tough guy]] many [[flame war]]s online actually end up in a cage much to the hilarity of armchair generals and gays alike.

[[Moderator]]s of TUF are red. Some moderators turn off this option off so as to mix it with their lower brethren. Becoming a moderator on a TUF subforum is easy and many known trolls are now moderators. There is also a mysterious 'rogue mod' (Nick May, still being a faygot after all these years) who dishes out avenging angel vigilante bannings on poor MMA fanboys.

Users who pay for extras on the site are blue.  The extras included on the site include being able to post HTML and having your name looking like a [[faggotry|smurf]]. Black names are known as [[niggers|mudnamers]]. Nothing is [[AZN|lower]] than a mudnamer and you will be reminded of this daily by [[goatse|bluenamers]] since the forum is simply a model for the oppression of apartheid that was once prevalent in the country of [[aids|South Africa]]; home of the creator of the forum, [[money|Kirik Jenness]].

Anyone with under 1000 posts are also referred to as [[sick fuck|KKM's]] (a term for a HMTL spamming troll who went by the misnomer KingKnightmare). The term now lost in the fog of MMA parlance is oft-quoted by fanboys to reaffirm their homosexuality status in the online tribe of [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|penis worshipers]]. Homosexuals on the forum are also refered to as Romosexuals which is an entirely clever play on the language of [[brazil|Brasil]] whose people pronounce their R's like H's.  Faggots are also called [[mormon|faygots]] due to their gayness.

Also, if you post on the forum you automatically do the following [[unrealistic expectations|IRL]]:

*[[buttsecks|Bench press 500 pounds]]. 
*Have a 12 inch [[gay|wang]]. 
*[[lie|Run a quarter mile in 5 seconds]]. 
*Tap out [[beaner|Rickson Gracie]] (whoever the fuck he is). 
*Eat hand grenades and piss napalm HAHAHA DISREGARD I SUCK COCKS.
*Chug 100 litres of [[buttsecks|spirits]] and beer without getting drunk. 
*Fuck a bevy of [[whore|supermodel]] girlfriends who you refer to as crap.
*Pack a mac-10, espouse street lingo and tell everyone how suburbia is like downtown Los Angeles.
*Are a legendary streetfighter in your home town whose [[alleged]] streetfight record is [[over 9000|over 9000-0]].
*Operate the death star at full capacity.

== Notable Users of TUF ==

Kirik Jenness - Kirik created the MMA boards, is uber-moderator and is often pictured with a large WWF-esque belt.  He has expressed his desire for an ethnically homogenous society, and has complemented a transsexual on his looks many, many times. 

[http://www.knucklepit.com/mixed%20martial%20arts-dana%20white.htm Dana White] - President of UFC.  Think Don King without a spine and keeps his grandmother chained to a wall.

Machine May - TUF once had an extraordinary [[sick fuck]] moderator named Nick 'Machine' May. Machine May claimed that he was a poor streetfighter who also ran a billionaire dollar sun tanning empire. His lies and [[attention]] seeking eventually drove him from the site after he was trolled into submission.

Mr.Zipplokk - 39-year old embittered moron who is best known for collecting email addresses of young males on the site for the purpose of email harrassment.  Alternately challenges other members to fight or to engage in gay sex.  He has had one of his challenges accepted by BIRD, a long time MMA forum member and amateur boxer.  This caused Zip to tuck his little pee-pee right between his legs and run off like the scared little girl he is.  

RickMassMMA - 5'2" fanboy "MMA Journalist" who thinks he's God's gift to women.  Due to his diminutive stature, he posseses a huge inferiority complex, which leads him to threaten the physically handicapped with bodily harm in order to preserve his feeling of manhood (or lack thereof.)

OneManArmy (tm) - Standing at 4 foot, nothing. OneManArmy, otherwise known as OMA is the midwest champion (of the world). He trains with current UFC figher "Handsome" Matt Wiman. OMA suffers severely from a case of little man syndrome. Got permanently banned from the UG for posting a false report of the death of former UFC fighter [[shit nobody cares about|Kimo Leopoldo]]. Ironically it was only after OMA posted that Kimo was dead that for the first time ever, people actually gave a flying fuck that Kimo even exists.

Train Judo- [[Fucktard]] named Quincy Rice from Michigan who wears hospital scrubs and seems to think he is some kind of badass, but only won one amateur fight and retired, declaring himself one of the greatest fighters in the world. He constantly tries to sound tough and threaten people, but his efforts are pointless as we all know he sucks cock every night.  He runs a school of deluded fools who train with him and call themselves the "droogs" which, as everyone knows, is a Spanish word that means "a whale's vagina."

== Drama on TUF ==

Drama on TUF is created by [[troll]]s, female [[attention whore]]s who want to bed pro-fighters, burnt-out fighters who make ridiculous claims about returning to the ring a la Rocky Balboa, [[13 year old boys]] arguing about the deadliness of monkey kung fu, sleazy fight promoters who screw upcoming fighters and just plain ol' homosexual testosterone. There are always scams running on TUF under the guise of an infirmed member needing money for medical bills, an out of work single mother in need of a boost, etc; these are usually transparent efforts to avoid labor at all costs by trolls who use sympathy as a weapon against the stupid and financially stable. A lot of the trolling drama comes from a rival MMA forum entitled [http://www.fightsport.com/fsport/jsp/index.jsp Fightsport]. Fightsport trolls spend all day mulling over the [[drama]] of their TUF-brethren and regularly launch [[Almighty Pillage|Mongol-style invasion]]s of the forum.

=== Current Drama ===

20 year old MMA [[fanboy]] Robert Mrotek who posts under the pseudonym "Fearless Goat" [[allegedly]] [http://www.lukebeston.net/2005/04/lukebestonnet-allegedly-contacted-by.htm talked trash] about professional fighter [http://www.sherdog.com/fightfinder/fightfinder.asp?fighterID=64 Chris Brennan] in an email to another fighter [http://www.sherdog.com/fightfinder/fightfinder.asp?fighterid=14 Guy Mezger]. It was later found that trolls may have [[allegedly]] stirred up the [http://www.lukebeston.net/2005/04/person-claiming-to-be-guy-mezger_30.htm trouble].

Mrotek was outed by Ryan Lankford for having pled guilty to the criminal offense of sexual assault.  He is strongly disliked for his propensity to draw attention to himself and to type in "TTT" literally dozens of times on threads he creates. 

[http://www.ktfo.tv/default.asp KTFO] fight promoter Craig Fields who goes under the name "Holla C" [http://www.lukebeston.net/2005/03/mayhem-miller-provides-proof-that.htm doesn't pay] fighter [http://www.sherdog.com/fightfinder/fightfinder.asp?fighterID=1807 Jason Miller] and then also challenges UFC boss Dana White to a [http://www.lukebeston.net/2005/03/ktfos-holla-c-attacks-ufc-challenges.htm fistfight]. The forum goes up in arms against the fight promoter.  Much drama ensues including many of the forum notables supporting the thievery of professional fighters.

There is also a poster named Bill MacPherson who posts as Ike Turner on Fightsport.  He is known to obtain the email addresses of others on the Underground and Fightsport and attempt to arrange real-life meetings for the purpose of having gay sex.  Several posters from Fightsport have taken him up on his offer, only to be met with an about-face reverse dick-tucking.  He currently posts under the Underground handle, "I Drink Man Juice."

== Accusations of Nationalist Oppression against UK ==

It is widely perceived that there is a lot of nationalist oppression practiced against people from the UK who post on the Underground forum. This is widely perceived to be a result of the superiority of UK fighters and UK people in general. The UK is a nation of only 60 million people and yet it has a winning record in UFC fights against the much larger USA (350 million people). It is believed that this - along with the superior striking ability of UK fighters - is the main cause of the oppression of the UK posters.

This oppression takes many forms. One of them is in posting derogatory photoshops of the top-ranked, future Middleweight champion and Hall of Famer, Michael Bisping, who hails from Clitheroe in the UK, even though Bisping is now just two fights away from a UFC title shot. This oppression also takes the form of unfair treatment by renegade moderators - in particular, the aformentioned mrzipplokk and ausgepicht (who is notably for having suffered the first ever actual nervous breakdown on the UG, and for having a restraining order taken out on him by UFC Welterweight champion, Georges St. Pierre).

However, in recent times the ranks of the UK posters have grown and they have united to form what is known as UKTT (UK Top Team), in order to fight back against the nationalist oppression of UK posters in general. The roots of UKTT lie in the creation, by world-renowned MMA authority, explodingboy, of the original "Official Team UK/Bisping Bandwagon" thread. This thread is notable for having broke the record for the number of "ownings" in a single thread (at last count over two dozen ownings were handed out by UK posters on hateful American posters).

== TUF's moar retarded brother: The Otherground ==

Completing the area that attracts homosexuals, the Otherground forum also boasts a high level of disabled persons, black intellectuals, British guys who bash the American government, pedophiles, and Christians. 

The Otherground forum began as an area where Underground Forum posters could share various topics unrelated to the gay human cock fighting that is MMA. As it turned out, gay human cock fighting was what placed the Otherground on the Internets map. 

Dahosse (a TUF member; arrested in May 2005 for stalking Ricco Rodriguez in Huntington Beach) attempted to use his super cool Republican legislative powers to shut down the OG. However, the Otherground was almost entirely comprised of retards, blacks, fags, [[Bestiality|goat fornicators]] and NAMBLA members.  This promptly made the various [[Racism|affirmative action]] groups, ACLU pussies and whiny TUF forum members get together for a brixshitting threesome - they threatened to take Kirik to internets court and throw millions of dollars down the crapper.

In turn, Kirik's only available recourse was to take out the "ARCHIVES" section, a section where mods had saved classic threads.  These threads are still available to paying members that Kirik deems worthy enough to suck his cock for the privilege.  

=== Current Drama - OG ===

Forum member Z Guard was recently outed as an angsty [[azn]] teen shota. Claims to have extensive insight into modern global economics owing to extensive [[goatse|internet research]], or more likely [[World of Warcraft|Gold Farming]].  Rumored to have an apartment in the sweetest part of [[basement dwellers|town]].

* SergeK (likes [[tranny|Eastern European women]]; posted his desktop with 'TRANNY' folder in plain view) likes [[shota]]

* KirbyLovesTacos (one of the stars of TLC's Fattest Teen series; died in the 5th season due to severe obesity and fear of ArtWanderlei)
* tjmitch (the most average member by far; shouldn't really be mentioned in this section)
* Gritty (Rhode Island's biggest and only [[faggot|Laker fan]]; hates [[List of sex moves|ATM]] Debit cards; Sued by Hidden Valley Ranch for slander)
* Alex Wysocki (injected growth hormone into penis to achieve average penis size; dropped out of Jordan Lynch body off competition)
* Jordan Lynch (retarded teenager adopted by Kirik for sexual purposes and pill testing)
* The People's Knee (Winner of the Ugliest Man Alive competition in 2006, 2007, and 2009: retired; sued Peter Jackson for unauthorized use or depiction of self image in all three Lord of the Rings film: won; caused cancellation of the Hobbit prequel movie to Lord of the Rings)
* Retard (Recently released from prison for unlawfully collecting social security benefits due to unfounded claims of mental retardation; currently dating breezah; used to fornicate with 17 year olds in Texas as their laws of statute allow this) 
* SisterSteel (transsexual voice of the OG; recently completed transition of woman to man; clit is up to 4 inches, matching AWysocki's growth hormone penis goal; claims that women hit on her more than men do because they "want to surf her forbidden waters" which, when chemically broken down in a lab, consists of astroglide, diet mountain dew, growth hormone, and hot dog juices)
* McDonald's Fan/Mick Donald's Fan/McD's fan/KKM (Quite possibly the only heterosexual on the OG; a highly respected fast food journalist and disabled veteran) also a gigantic faggot with a congenital third penis near his mouth
* angryinch (winner of the 2008 Ugliest Man Alive competition; defaulted on Chrysler Crossfire and Epiphone Les Paul payments; made fun of by Japanese people) 
* OGTT (Otherground Top Team - a band of miscreant homosexuals who clout their 'top' position in various man-on-man relationships; claims of world domination have fallen short of even 1/100,000,000,000% of planned goals; due to this, scientists and researchers have surmised that the OGTT are most likely 'power bottoms') 
* Evil Master - A conspiracy retard, in the truest sense of the word.  EVERYTHING is a conspiracy, and no amount of knowledge will change his mind.   Loves to leave threads unanswered, ignores questions, and is hated by everyone but a handful.  His inverted penis is a sight for sore eyes.
