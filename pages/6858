[[Image:ray jones.jpg|thumb|His most beloved [[cumrag]].]]

'''Ray Jones''' is a [[sick fuck|jolly fellow]] [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=318+old+robstown,+corpus+christi+tx&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=318+Old+Robstown+Rd,+Corpus+Christi,+Nueces,+Texas+78408&z=16 from Corpus Christi] [[Texas]] who is openly and proudly  in love with Gadget Hackwrench from ''Chip n Dale's Rescue Rangers'', making him a [[Rangerphile|Rangerphile]]. However, worse than most Rangerphiles, Ray actually [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|believes he is in a monogamous relationship with this cartoon character]] despite having a wife, children, and grandchildren. 

He has been known, and in fact has openly admitted to, dressing members of his family as characters from ''Rescue Rangers'', doubtless for some [[pedophilia|sinister and twisted]] purpose, as well as producing a [[shitload|staggering amount]] of [[shitty art|artwork]] detailing what can only be called a pathological obsession with Gadget. The sheer volume of his "[[shit|art]]", as well as his [[no life|single-minded dedication]] to the insane idea of loving a cartoon character and his vocal support of recruiting others to this cause, has led him to become the [[GodJesus|God-Emperor]] of all [[Rangerphilia]], worshiped and adored by all the [[fucktard|degenerate retards]] that practice the perversion.



Just remember, kids: '''''It's not nice to fuck mice'''''.

[[Image:Bestpicevermadeforray.jpg|thumb|PLEASE RAY, NOOOOO! *sob*]]

''First, [[Lie|while I have created a few original characters]], all my art revolves around [[Pedobear|Gadget Hackwrench]], who is copyright Disney. Obviously, there are legal issues. Why not create a mouse character and work with her instead of Gadget. Doesn't work that way. My feelings are for *Gadget*. She is the one I am motivated to [[masturbation|pick up my pencil]] for, to moderate websites for, to toil hours for with [[no life|no possibility]] of any compensation other than to lay my work at her tiny feet as a [[semen |love-offering]].

The problem is that I am serious about my work with her and [[Lie|I do a great deal of G-rated work as well]]. I plan to do much more pron and much more family-friendly art and stories in the future. My family friendly activities have been negatively impacted by my X-rated work. There are deviantART who will not allow me to post their art in the G-rated Rescue Ranger fan calendar I assemble each month because of it. Other Gadget artists will not even talk to me on that account. This in no way shakes my confidence that my work is basically *right* but sometimes I do feel that it costs me something.

There is the family thing, too, of course. I have a wife, two sons and a couple of grandchildren. My wife and sons are aware of my work. I cannot say they are happy about it, but since they know it is part of my creative impulses, they are willing to put up with it. I would hate, however, to have any repercussions from it cause *them* any problems or discomfort. Again, I cannot help but feel there is a potential cost there.

Work hasn't really been in the equation. Some of my coworkers know of my art, but I don't think they consider my G-rated pictures any weirder than my smut.

Okay, before getting into the next part, let me emphasize that I am not subject to hallucinations or anything. I am perfectly well aware that Gadget does not really exist. "She" is physically only a collection of drawings. But I have in my mind an image of her, her behavior and personality. Sometimes I feel that she has developed from the TV cartoon into a sexually mature young lady mouse. She has the same needs and wants for a healthy, vigorous, and nurturing sex life as any other strong and energetic young woman. [[Sick_fuck|And I have tried in all my work to give her that life.]] We all need to be [[Rape|loved]]. But I think it is just as important to find someone in life who is worthy of our love to whom to give it. But on the other hand, that is quite different from the Gadget of the original series. Sometimes I am torn by the feeling that she would not want to be so open about it, that that would be [[Canon|contradictory to her basic personality]]. That, for all the heart and warmth I try to put into my work "she" would still not care for such a public expression of it. that I am forcing her to fit my own ideas and opinions and 
disregarding hers. That dichotomy does hurt sometimes after a short period, I changed my mind and came back to it again.

There are any number of motives. For one thing, as Priest mentioned, there is sheer physical desire. [[Furry|I love Gadget.]] I admit it. If that makes me [[insane]], so be it. I gain so much more than I lose. I ache to show that love in both porn and in G-rated work. All theories about artistic freedom and freedom of expression aside, we all know that there is, in our society, an inherent conflict between the two. [[Wank|That is a flaw in our society.]]''"

[http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?pi=1000157652 HAY GUYZ, RAY JONES DOESN'T CARE THAT WE THINK HE'S A MOUSEFUCKER.]

I am a Rangerphile. [[Old|I am 51 years old]] [[Bullshit|with college degrees in biology and
chemistry.]] I am married and have grown children of my own in college now. I
have a ''Rescue Ranger'' website and do original art...I have a collection of RR books and toys. In short, [[Batshit|I have reached a point in life where I feel I am free to recognize what I like and
free to say so.]]

For the critics, I have something to say which is for your own good. Please
understand that I am not trying to injure you or cause you irreparable harm, but
rather to teach you something about life. Here goes:

You don't like my RR "obsession" and consider me and my brethren nerds and worse.

Deep breath now.

I. Don't. Care.

That's right. Means absolutely nothing to me. I know what I like about the
cartoon series, what it means to me artistically, psychologically, and
imaginatively and I do not need anyone else's validation for it. It's called
"self insight" and is probably THE most politically incorrect of all states.
For some of you this may be an almost apocalyptic revelation, but for your own
good, there it is.

Now, I recommend that all of the fashionably dressed, properly "big grown up boy
now", pseudo-cool types stop here, lest it get even worse.

Proceed at your own risk!

You were warned!

==Activities==

[[Image:Rangerfags.jpg|thumb|Welcome to the party, Longcat and /b/tard!!!!]]

Ray has a few shitty webpages that are [[Asking for it|begging]] for rape. They're all full of his horrible, horrible fan art of Gadget and other characters from ''[[Rangerphile|Rescue Rangers]]''.

He has also written fapfiction about Gadget. One may wonder how a mouse and a human can fuck, but he illustrates how in horrible drawings of himself and Gadget (though he never [[Jam It In|jammed it in]] because even Ray's tiny shriveled dick is too large for the average mouse). Through these, his '''urethral fetish was discovered and is begging to be exploited.''' 

Ray Jones suffers from a falsely inflated ego, thinking everyone on the internet is just foaming at the mouth to see his [[Shitty art|art]] or read his fapfiction. Nobody does though, mainly because all his work centers around himself: yes, he self-inserts his old fat ass into almost everything he does. 

Ray moderates a forum called [http://www.theacorncafe.org The Acorn Cafe] about the Rescue Rangers. All of the "[[Rangerphile|Rangerphiles]]" there have [[no life]] and hate [[/b/tards]]. His lulz potential is just above [[over 9000|9,000]]. The best way to help milk this [[lulzcow]] is to try to obtain personal information by contacting him through his sites.

[[image:RayJonesCoS.jpg|center]]

==People in his life==

[[Image:Rayjonesbluedress2.jpg|thumb|left|Meet Jalapena - Hola!]]

[[Image:Ray's Friend.jpg|thumb|OMG HE HAS FANS?!]]

Ray has a wife; she does not like his [[Shitty art|porn]]. Maybe this is because he draws her as a fat mouse-whore who fucks that stupid fat character that likes cheese? Perhaps. It could also be because Ray openly admits all over the internets that he actually loves this crappy cartoon character more than his wife.  

Ray also has two sons that are grown with kids, both know he loves a cartoon to '''some''' extent - but only in the "wtf" and not the "OMG get away from my childrens" sort of way. Perhaps someone should send them some nice letters, since his friend [[Alexreynard]] accidentally [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/535030/ doc dropped him] in his FurAffinity journal.

[[Image:Gadgettime.jpg|thumb|left|"Hey grandpa, can I see your fanart?"]]

We know one of his daughter-in-laws knows about his sick obsession to some extent as well. According to the other "[[Rangerphile|Rangerphile]]", she apparently is the person who actually sewed the Gadget costume Ray's grandchild was wearing.  If only she knew Grandpa Ray wrote a 36-page comic about fucking that same cartoon character. Creepy.

We also now know according to his long journal post on [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/rayjones/ Yiff Gallery] that is co workers actually know a bit about this as well. Needless to say, Ray does not realize how insane he is, and shares his art with everyone that will look for more then 5 seconds. After which they promptly RUN AWAY.

Ray states "''Work hasn't really been in the equation. Some of my coworkers know of my art, but I don't think they consider my G-rated pictures any weirder than my smut.''"

Uh huh, Ray. Keep telling yourself that, old man.

==The True Victim== 

[[Image:rayspoorwife.jpg|thumb|He keeps her around to sew his cum rags.]]

The true [[victim]] in all of this faggotry has to be his poor [[Domestic violence|neglected wife]], Imelda. What lady would tolerate this sort of '''OPEN''' insanity from her husband?  The man mentions their names all over the tubes, making Ray's whacked out [[Rangerphile|Rangerphile]] lifestyle completely open to the whole world to [[Fursecution|bask in awe]] of. He draws [[over 9000|LOTS]] of porn of a children's cartoon character that he himself did not even watch as a child. Not just naked sweet anthropomorphic toon mouse bootie + tit pics, but pages....PAGES of fan comics about him fucking a 5" animal. He buys old crusty toys of the doll online that some child used to drool on and has [[buttsecks|tea parties]] with them, probably while she is at work or sewing his latest cum rag. 

[[Image:Biteit.jpg|thumb|right|Foreplay for Ray.]]

[[Image:OMGTOYSEXS.jpg|thumb|$300 plush toy, I shit you not.]]

The [[cum|icing on Ray's twisted cake]] is that he actually includes her in his porn. No, he does not draw porn of him fucking her for 40 pages in ponds of sparkling roses, she is some sort of whore-mouse named "[[Mexican|Jalapeña]]" that looks like she is about to go to a [[rave]], is a waitress, and fucks the fat mouse character Monty. Could she fuck one of the chipmunks who is apparently quite the penis eye-candy for Rangerphiles? NO! NO PRIME CHIPMUNK DICK 4 YOU IMELDA!!! You get the fat one that likes cheese and hangs out with a bug.

The sad thing about some of the pages that [[7chan|Internet geniuses]] have dug up is that we don't even need to add text to some of them to lulz off the computer chair. We will let the actual quotes from his pieces about "Jalapena" do the rest of the talking......

* "He paid me ten dollars. Ten dollars for my virginity! Bastard! It was probably the smallest bill he had on him."

* "I followed the smell of food to the dumpster back in the motel restaurant. In my whole life, that was the best meal I ever had."

* "I did it a few times until the one guy - a squirrel - asked me why the hell I was selling myself so cheap."

We hope Imelda wises up, packs her bags, and goes back [[In the kitchen|home]]. Run for it lady, before he [[Bestiality|kicks it up a notch]] and starts sewing little gadget [[cosplay|outfits for real]] and fucking them instead of you!

==Awesome Fanart! It only took him 54 years to draw that good!==

Ray is a master of [[Ms_paint|digitally rendering illustrations]]; that's why we hate him so much. /b/tards say this art a 54 year old man draws about a cartoon character gives them epic lulz, but the Rangerphiles have figured out that the chans are full of shit and they actually [[Lulz|LOVE]] his sexy, hairy, mouse-on-man art! You are correct [[furry|Rangerphiles]]! You win TEH [[Aids|INTERNETS]]

After Ray found out several [[Anonymous|art enthusiasts]] had become fans of his adult art and wanted to share his hidden gems to his forum BFF, he did the noble thing and beat them to the punch.  He stated to his [[furry|peers]] that he was now officially going to quit drawing his magnificent adult work 4 EVER and just let it fade away on the internets. [[Anonymous|We]], however, feel that they are a great value to art as we know it and wish to archive it so future generations may [[lulz|admire it]]

==Awesome Fanfiction!==

Everyone knows you have to be a [[retard|great]] writer before you can be a decent comic author. Ray Jones proves he's no slouch with his own [[Ray Jones/fanfic|fanfic]] about fucking Gadget in some other way than in his original comic. Prime [[lulz]] in here. Click '''[[Ray Jones/fanfic|HERE]]''' to read this [[fat|beautiful]] [[fanfiction|tale]] of [[sex|love]] and a powerful [[fetish|bond]] that can never be broken.

UPDATE: /co/ has thoughtfully provided fanfiction about Ray.

[[BAWWW|Imelda looked up from her book as she heard the door open. Her husband Ray poked his head through. "Hey, honey. Want to watch Rescue Rangers with me?" She smiled politely and shook her head. "No thank you. Aren't you... Forgetting something?" He thought for a moment. "Popcorn? I could always make some for you. You like the healthy diet stuff, don't you?" She sighed. "No. Go watch your cartoon." She said, resentment seeping into her voice. He didn't notice and shrugged. "Alright. If you change your mind..." He closed the door and left the room. She tried to read more but didn't feel like reading any more. She flipped to a page with a picture and stared at it, thinking of other things. She thought of when she was a child. All she had wanted(other than a flying pony, but what little girl didn't?) was a prince to come and sweep her into his arms into his palace where they'd live happily ever after. As she got older her fantasies had sobered. A kind man with a sense of humor that would always be there for her, love her for who she was. She felt a sob coming, but pushed it down. She closed her book. She felt an urge to throw it against the wall, but waited a moment and gently placed it on her nightstand. She pulled the string of the lamp and pulled the cozy blanket over herself. She heard the cartoon in the living room, and before she knew it tears were rolling down her face, and she started sobbing.
It was their anniversary.]]

Is there anything Ray [[fail|can't do!?]] [[shit|Amazing!]] Do you keep these in your [[Basement_dweller|living room]] for your whole family to [[vomit|admire]], Ray?

==Gadget Hackwrench's Official Response to Ray Jones' Obsession of Gadget==

[[Image:Image-gadgets_response_on_perverted_ray.jpg]]

== Mousefucker is back ==

[[Image:Gadget pron.jpg|Deep Space Toon Mouse Bootie|thumb]]

After being reminded [[over 9,000]] times that fucking mice is wrong, it seemed that Ray Jones had finally realized how much of a [[sick fuck]] he really is. He proceeded to announce that he was done drawing Gadget porn for good. Only the [[Rangerphile|Rangerphiles]] were left to bawwww while the rest of the Internets rejoiced. Unfortunately, this was all a lie. 

To nobody's surprise, Ray returned to his sick and twisted world of Gadget erotica, much to the disgust of the entire Internets. It's like a typical story of a drug addict who can't stay away from the shit. But this involves a 60 year old furfag, [[rule 34]] involving Gadget Hackwrench, and a urethra fetish instead. Things only got worse when Ray made a sequel to ''Cheer Up Gadget'' called ''Gadget's Space Stories''. But before the Internets could shit itself yet again, most of the Gadget porn magically disappeared. It was [[Delete fucking everything|deleted]] by Ray in an attempt to thwart any possible shitstorm that would've developed as a result of his latest fucked up work. Too bad for Ray the comic is still a piece of shit regardless.

He has uploaded this to his new [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/jonescientific FurAffinity account].

== Ray found a new victim ==
Ray found a new victim to perpetuate his furfaggotery: Tink. May [[Anonymous|God]] save us all:
[http://www.theacorncafe.org/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=21780 Click here for his confession]

Also, saved for great justice:

{{quote|<small>Um, why am I posting about the new Tinkerbell movie here instead of on the off-topic board?
<BR><BR>
BECAUSE DISNEY HAS TRANSPLANTED GADGET'S BRAIN INTO TINKERBELL'S BODY!!!!!
<BR><BR>
I'm not kidding! I always understood that "Tinkerbell" was a derivative of "Tinkle Bell" (and bells were sometimes used to indicate fairy voices). But in this new production, they take it literally - Tink is a "tinker fairy" and a rather ditzy inventor. Unlike the nature fairies, her department serves a support role for the other fairy departments, making various sorts of tools and such.
<BR><BR>
Having just been created by a baby's first laugh, Tink is assigned her new post. She finds the routine work boring but becomes fascinated with trying to make something out of some human junk she finds. She wants to visit the human world to see where these fascinating springs and screws come from, but tinker fairies do not do that. So she makes some attempts at becoming a different type of fairy. During these various fiascos, she cheers herself up by reassembling a broken music box she finds.
<BR><BR>
One last attempt at changing jobs ruins the fairies preparations for spring and she nearly runs away. After a last minute change of heart, she starts churning out a series of new inventions to accelerate the other fairies work - all of which work exactly as planned. Sound familiar?
<BR><BR>
It's a pretty good movie overall, quite humorous (especially when Tink tries to teach a hapless baby bird how to fly or to supply some light for a squadron of fireflies). But come on! The only things missing are the mouse ears, a few "golly"s and a scar around her head from the brain transplant!

<Ray_jones> They're always sick, we're taking you fuckers down.
<Chipfan> Go ahead and try, you'll never destroy our sites and you'll never stop all of us.
<Ray_jones> lolololololololololololololol, we are legion.
<Chipfan> So?
<Ray_jones> So Anonymous eats pieces of shit like you for breakfast.
<Chipfan> You eat shit for breakfast? o_O
<Chipfan> hahahahahahaha
<Ray_jones> You'd like it if I did, wouldn't you? ;)
<Chipfan> Actually, I like something else for breakfast.
<Ray_jones> Yeah? Like what?
<Chipfan> Reese's.
<Ray_jones> Candy? For Breakfast?
<Chipfan> Not candy. Reese's Puffs Cereal!
* Chipfan hands Ray_jones a bowl
<Chipfan> Try some

So I did.

I shoved the spoon in my mouth, and a totally bombastic wave of peanut butter and chocolaty taste bombards my taste buds.

Reese's Puff Cereal:

It's Reese's, FOR BREAKFAST!

And so we learn here that Anonymous is really fucking [[ADHD]].
