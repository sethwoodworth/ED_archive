Regardless of where you park, [[ALLCAPS|'''MEET UP BY THE FUCKING DINING HALL AND BAND BUILDING!!''']]
Co$ is due South-East of where we will be meeting.
Judging by the pic, this looks like a 20-ish minute walk or so, remember:
*We have the opportunity to garner public support, [[DO_IT_FAGGOT|DO IT!]]


==Dress code==
[[Image:ANONYMOOSE2.jpg|thumb|Anonymoose approves this dress code]]
*Wear nice clothes. You just have to be presentable.
*No masks. Sun glasses, a hat and even a scarf are recommended to [[Anonymous|shield /i/dentities]].  Surgical masks are acceptable, too.
*Die hard Anons will be in black suits, white dress shirts, black ties
*Purple medical gloves <s>are a possibility</s> ARE A [[Fact|REALITY]] AND WILL BE PROVIDED BY ENONYMOUS IN SIZES MEDIUM THROUGH X-LARGE ([[gay|LOL THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID]])

[[Image:IRL_support.jpg|thumb|This is how we want to look (except no paper covering our faces)]]

'''[[PROTIP|IMPORTANT:]] Even though AZ is an open carry state, DO NOT BRING GUN[S] WITH YOU.  GUARANTEED  [[Banhammer|ARREST]].'''  Srsly, I will [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Punch0dv.gif kick your ass].

# No megaphones.
# No fighting.
# No yelling.
# No drinking/drugs.
# Obey any [[Party_van|law enforcement officers]] present.  [[Don't_Taze_Me_Bro|DO NOT FUCK AROUND WITH THEM]]!
# We cannot [[Pool's_Closed|/b/lockade the entire sidewalk]], there needs to be [[AIDS|room]] for people to [[hax|get by]].
# Do not under any circumstances threaten a [[Scientology|scifag]].  If they [[Emo|piss you off]] and you want to [[Pwnage|curbstomp them]], '''DO NOT DO IT!!'''  It would be beyond [[lulz]] but your [[Party_van|arrest]] and subsequent [[raep|anal prison rape]] would not be (for you, that is, we would will lul irl).


''From NinjaLlama:''
While it's still fresh in my head:

I spoke to Jeff (Woods?) about our protest on Sunday. A few plain clothes phx police officers are going to be at our protest to make sure everything goes smoothly.

Regarding picket signs, there's no law about having a certain sized handle on your sign, it's not regarded as a weapon. Feel free to put a handle on your sign if you want to.

Along with not impeding traffic on the sidewalks, we also cannot block a driveway. This isn't a big deal on the 7th st. side of the building, but the Indian School side has three or so driveways. An officer will just ask you to move over if we do block a driveway.

Filming people is completely allowed as we are going to be on public property. The officer I spoke to recommended that if we wanted to get a good overview of the whole protest that we set up a camera across the street.

'''We don't need a permit regardless of the number of people who show up.'''

<Enonymous> so what was the deal with the cops?<br>
<Enonymous> the scifags already contacted them?<br>
<Ninja|Vanish> a new guy (to me) called me back, some guy named Jeff<br>
<Enonymous> right<br>
<Ninja|Vanish> said he was told to call me back because he was already working on our stuff<br>
<Enonymous> o rly?<br>
<Ninja|Vanish> didn't say anything about the scifags calling at all<br>
<Enonymous> hm<br>
<Enonymous> well that's good then<br>
<Enonymous> so plainclothes?<br>
<Ninja|Vanish> yup<br>
<Ninja|Vanish> sounded like there's going to be at least 2<br>
<Enonymous> nice<br>
<Ninja|Vanish> he seemed fairly surprised that we were as organized as we were, well, pleasantly surprised at least<br>
<Enonymous> good<br>
<Enonymous> did you stress that anyone acting outside of our rules needs to be ejected, regardless if they are "with us" or "them"?<br>
<Ninja|Vanish> yup<br>
<Enonymous> sweet<br>
<Enonymous> I'm sure they were glad to hear that<br>
<Ninja|Vanish> indeed<br>
<Ninja|Vanish> he said we were going about everything the right way and that we shoud be fine<br>
<Enonymous> good<br>
<Ninja|Vanish> okay, I'm gonna go get dinner, my stomach is getting angry at me<br>
<Enonymous> k<br>
<Enonymous> ttyl<br>
'''<Ninja|Vanish> oh yea, he said that if we plan any other protests after this one, to call him and notify him and we'll get the same support''' -- [[EPIC]] [[WIN]]<br>
<Enonymous> fucking killer!
