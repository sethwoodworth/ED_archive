Journal
A '''journal''' (manly word for diary) is "A personal record of occurrences, experiences, and reflections kept on a regular basis; a diary."[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=journal] An '''on-line''' journal (as opposed to an [[IRL]] journal) is the same thing, only it is kept on-line, and is usually open to the public. IRL journals are traditionally private. Many people keep an OL journal and a separate IRL journal. Males should never admit to keeping and maintaining a journal <s>cuz</s> because your friends will think you're some kinda fag.

==Types of journals==

===IRL journals===

IRL journals can usually be found under beds or deep inside a [[Boobs|chest]] of drawers, next to the vibrator, or hidden under a playboy magazine in your teacher's desk. They are normally hand-written rather than typed. You normally have to date a [[16 year old girls|girl]] for a couple of months before she will offer you a chance to read her [[IRL]] journal.  [[You]] should refuse unless she will not [[anal sex|have sex]] with you until you do.

===OL journals===

On-line journals are typically open to the public, although some journal sites give you the option to hide specific entries (or the entire journal) from unauthorized users. [[LiveJournal]] calls this feature making entries "[[friends only]]", and making your journal "friends only" is a popular way to avoid [[troll]]s. But since [[me|you]] are an insatiable [[Attention whore|comment whore]] and have no friends anyways, this is kind of redundant.

===A Comparison===
There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Your IRL journal will never be famous, and you will never become an [[Internet celebrity]] thanks to an IRL journal (Unless, that is, you have a really good public relations agent, like Anne Frank. However, you can write anything you want in your IRL journal without getting in trouble (except for that [[Pedophile]] that got tossed in prison for writing about child [[pornography]]), whereas OL journal sites often have [[TOS|Terms of Service]] which you must abide by.

Both IRL and OL journals have "Me" as the primary subject. Creative diarists will sometimes veer into related topics, like "What do you think of me?" and "Here's what me thinks of [[you]]."  [[Meme]]s and personality-analyzing quizzes are eternally popular entries in [[journal]]s because they allow the author a new way of looking at himself, sometimes with pie charts. Pathological egomaniacs use "I" and "me" about four times per sentence, while [[16-year-old girl]]s and leather-clad submissives will always use a lower case "i" or even speak about themselves in the third person -- though their journals are no less self-centered for it.


===Fictional Journals ===
Some people use the diary structure when writing fiction. This is useful for writers who don't have any actual writing abilities whatsoever but still want to achieve critical and commercial success. Some of these are tragedies, like [[Fatass|Bridget Jones's Diary]], and some are comedies, like ''[[Time Cube|The Diary of Anne Frank]]''.
