'''Computer gremlins''' are what cause everything and anything on a [[computer]] to go wrong.  They are everywhere technology exists, constantly attempting to meddle in your technological affairs. When a computer crashes, is acting slow, or just won't do what you want it to, you can rest assured that computer gremlins are working overtime to ruin your day.

B.T knows what's going on.

==History==
[[Image:GremlinsMAC.jpg|thumb|Somebody's [[Mac]] is in serious trouble.]]
Back when [[Al Gore]] invented the [[Internets]], the [[communist]] revolutionary [[Gary Coleman]] formed a small band of anti-internets elitists in an effort to destroy it. These followers later were dubbed computer gremlins.

==Info to know==
Computer gremlins prey on helpless [[noob]]s and the [[Oh god how did this get in here I am not good with computers|computer illiterate]]; they have few vulnerabilities. One is cottage cheese; computers should be thoroughly doused in cottage cheese to prevent any tomfoolery computer gremlins may try to carry out behind your back. Another is deletion of the [[System32]] folder, which totally negates any and all malicious activity gremlins get up to, prevents future infection, and has the bonus effect of doubling your computer's processing speed.
