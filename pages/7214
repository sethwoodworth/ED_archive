The moment the Earl of '''Sammich''' slapped [[cock|meat]] between two pieces of bread, the [[world]] changed. It has ushered in a brave new world of culinary revolution. Our taste buds can only thank [[God]] that such a delicious entrée known as the sandwich exists. Sandwich!  Oh, beautiful sandwich!  I love you in so many ways. I love that you are compact and mobile. Your deliciousness is ever so apparent. Make no mistake, a sandwich is the best meal in the world.

The reason the sandwich is so good is because of how it is made; i.e. by [[woman|women]] who know their place. And suck a mans dick while preforming the task of making him a sammich which makes the sammich much better, as long as she's not a stupid fat whore. Take any edible object in the world, and that object is instantly made better by being stuck between two pieces of bread. The combinations are endless. The peanut enthusiast can thank his lucky stars, for instance, for the peanut butter sandwich. [[Cheese]]: staid and [[boring]] until you transform it -- with the aid of wheat and a pan -- into a grilled cheese sandwich. Let us not forget the ultimate sandwich in the world: the BLT. Separately, <s>bacon</s> (bacon is never boring.), lettuce and tomato can be quite [[boring]]. But add them together, top it with [[semen|mayo]], and bring on the bread, a BLT creates [[ruin|havoc]] upon your taste buds­ or -- as I like to call them­ -- your pleasure sensors. Yes, with so many combinations, this is one of the reasons the sandwich is the best.

Yet, it is also compact and [[slut|mobile]].  In other words, sandwiches make eating practical. While you ''can'' enjoy a sandwich on a plate, there are also myriads of places a sandwich can be enjoyed. Take, for instance, your car. While eating spaghetti when you are driving is possible, it is guaranteed to be messy. Not so with the sandwich. With only one hand, the sandwich can be enjoyed and consumed within minutes. Any [[roman shower|mess]] at all is minimal, and the best thing part?  You come away mostly clean. Also, a sandwich can also be enjoyed on a park bench, in a [[lollercoaster|roller coaster]], and in prison. The sandwich sees no ethnic boundaries -- unlike [[cephalopod|calamari]] and escargot.

Make no mistake about the sandwich; while it may be pragmatic in its design, it is also tasty. There is nothing comparable to a BLT. You may think that [[China|Chinese]] food comes close, but nothing can make you praise the Lord the same way the marriage of [[fruit]], vegetable, and Jew [[meat]] does.  A [[vulva|roast beef]] sub with Monterey jack cheese also puts you in ecstasy. The same can be said about a [[dong|cucumber]] sandwich with a hint of mayo. The sandwich is not only a boon for the culinary arts, it is also Western civilization's greatest statement.

[[Some argue|Make no question about it]]: the sandwich is the greatest. It can be made so many ways. It is compact and can be taken anywhere. Most importantly, however, it tastes great. The sandwich should be appreciated for what it is: it is not only good food, it is [[Man]]'s greatest statement about Existence -- condensed in edible form.
