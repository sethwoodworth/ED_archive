Long ago before the [[internets]], forbidden information ranging from how to make atom bombs to how to perform [[buttsex]] was obtained from [[IRL]] books published by Paladin-Press. '''Paladin-Press''' "Publisher of the Action Library", is the one stop shop for [[pyro]]s, [[anarchists]], [[survivalist]]s, and other [[basement dweller]]s to get their kicks. With these books you can even learn how to be the host of a [[Waco|massive barbecue]].

Some of their books and videos include:
*"Huffing Raid": The wonder drug
*Terrorism for Dummies
*Super Martial Art Death Techniques by Billy Blanks
*How to murder someone with a gun
*[[kill it with fire | Molotov Everything]]: How to vent your teenage angst
*Prove [[you | Your]] Innocence with [[Venn Diagram]]
*Murder/[[an hero | Suicide: The Final Solution]]
*How to Steal.  Written by [[Eric Bauman]], Forward by [[Quentin Tarantino]]
*Lol, y u stab me?: Defending yourself from [[Steve Irwin | stingray barb-in-the-heart]] attacks.

== Internets ==
In the 1980's most [[survivalist]]s who bought paladin press books had them stolen by their [[13 year old boy| 13 year old sons]], who in turn translated them into 1's and 0's resulting in the birth of [[Text files]]. These were uploaded to the internets, and the rest is history.
