Zeal
'''Lekali-Zealot''' (also known as '''Zeal''' or '''Rampant''') would appear to be just another furry at first glance; [[yiff]]ing anything she may come in contact with like a sexually frustrated [[furfag|rabbit]], but a more in-depth glance shows something completely different. No doubt about this one guys, she's a [[troll]].


== Outward Appearances ==

Originally a male human with purple-tinted skin and wings, Zealot has since changed throughout the 4 years she's been seen on the intarwebz. From [[dragon]] to feline to hermaphroditic feline to whatever the fuck else you can possibly think of. At the time of this article's birth, she is... some kind of freaky cat thing, uhh... hell, not many know WHAT the hell she is. White fur, four ears, and half her face reduced to a skull. Very [[attractive]], I'll tell you.

When not trolling, Zeal just acts like any furry would; emo, [[horny]], and a well-rounded [[lolcow]], but even at this level, she exhibits massive signs of trolldom including, but not limited to [[flame wars]] and attacking furries at a personal level.

== The Lulz ==

Some trolls may actually classify Zeal as being a bit... overenthusiastic about her [[lulz]]-gathering. Oh sure, there are the conventional [[lulz]] generating techniques like insults and [[mudkip|mudkips]], but more often than not, she'll attempt to gain personal information to spread around to other trolls, hijacking emails, and generally running the victim clear off whatever site she found them on, only to get [[ban|banned]] herself shortly afterward in a sea of holy fire. Lolmartyr. Kinda selfish, though, since once the [[lolcow]] escapes to the safety of obscurity, no other troll can have fun with them.

She also enjoys spreading [[drama]] around with suicide threats, horrible poetry (which is obviously a trolling attempt) and links to the [[Pain Series]]. This usually gets her banned too, only to return moments later with a sock puppet, and the [[lulz]] continues. What fun!

== WTF is Rampant? ==

The furry known as Rampant seems to be closely associated with Zeal. For those who don't know, Rampant is a red fox and a non-stop trolling machine who only appears in times of massive drama and turmoil. The reason the two seem to be connected is one's disappearance moments before the other appears. [[sock puppet]], anyone?

== Where To Find Her ==

Like most furries, Zeal can be found on the site [[Yiffstar]], though she's made, um... appearances at smaller conventions. However, unlike most trolls, she doesn't have a [[LiveJournal]] account, or at least no one can find it. Also, since she seems to love a good AIM raid, her AIM is Legend of Zealot. Some say she has other contacts, but no one cares enough to dig them up.
