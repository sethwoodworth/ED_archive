The furry [[fandom]]. A living [[furpile|cesspool]] of the desperate and [[goatse|twisted]] [[sick fuck|individuals]] clogging the internets with [[otherkin|fox wolf dragon hybrid]] cum. However, there are those that are even scorned and looked down upon by these [[retarded|mentally impaired]] individuals. A common term for such individuals is [[furfag]]. Foxon is the [[otherkin|physical embodiment]] of [[furfaggotry]] at its concentrated finest.

'''Foxon''', also known as ''Coleton Gower'', is a 19 year old <!--(DOB: 1991 april 14th)--> [[BPD|Asspie on steriods]] who hails from Prince George BC, Canada. He joined the furry fandom at the tender age of [[underage b&|15]]. His hobbies include whining, [[emo|cutting himself]], [[babyfur|shitting himself]], [[what|sleeping with a plushie that he pisses on]], [[tl;dr|writing hundreds of journals about how he can't write]], [[Bam Margera|treating his parents like shit]], and being [[butthurt|paranoid]] about anything and everything involving his ex [[Kitsune Youkai]]. Even worse, Foxon tries to convince everyone that the plushie he sleeps with is actually [[incest|his sister]].

==The Legend of Foxon: Butthurt Rising==
[[image:4yearsago2.png|thumb|proof that Foxon was a furry when he was 15. keep in mind he was born in 1991.]]
The source of Foxon's [[butthurt]] goes back to 2007. It all started when Foxon got together with [[Kitsune Youkai]]. A [[tl;dr]] pile of furfaggotry and [[drama]] began unwraveling as [[Kitsune Youkai|kitsune]] and his fake [[sockpuppet]] [[plushie|sister]] began [[yiffing]] with other peoples [[sockpuppet]] [[fursona|murrsona]]s. Since Foxon has [[BPD|Borderline Personality Disorder]], he instantly regarded this as though they just got married and Foxon found [[Kitsune Youkai|kitsune]] getting a [[blowjob|bj]] from a 2 dollar [[whore]] in a [[pooper|back alley]]. On November 15th, 2008 11:51 PM Kit broke up with foxon for being a whiny emo bawwfag retard. he then promptly made [http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/522040/ this journal entry] to baww about it.
What followed for the next year or so was the slowest break up ever (broke up and got together 3 more times), ending with Foxon being inflicted with a terminal case of [[butthurt]] that still lasts to this day.

[http://pastebin.com/nZprmFCW A brief summary of why Foxon is acting like such an asspie as written by Kitsune Youkai.]

==The Legend of Foxon: Oracle of [[Butthurt]]==
[[Image:Baww journal.png|thumb|Regularly yiffs with [[pedophiles|people much older than him]].]]
Ever since going through the pile of [[drama]] that he went through with Kitsune, coupled with his [[BPD]], Foxon has gone through the rest of his life as a [[WoW|lich]] from the [[DnD|plane of eternal woe]], constantly sucking all happiness from those unfortunate to come into contact with him. He has decided that since his [[oti|online]] relationship was [[srs bsns]] and made him have some [[butthurt|second thoughts]] with online relationships, he thought it would be best if [[unrealistic expectations|none of his friends knew each other. Ever.]] This however, was made a bit difficult by the fact that all of his friends [[fail|already knew each other]]. To try to fix this irreversable [[fact]] Foxon decided that the best course of action would be to [[BAWW|throw huge shitfits]] at all of his friends at all times.

From that point forward, his mood has been going up and down faster than the shoreline of [[tsunami|thailand]]. He made up his own fake sister so he could have one just like [[Kitsune Youkai|kitsune's]] and also found other [[troll bait|furries]] who bought into his huge pity stories to be his [[dying alone|online family]]. Any time he sees or hears anything vaguely resembling [[Kitsune Youkai]], he instantly goes on another BPD fueled crusade of butthurt against all who are within earshot. This also usually results in at least 1 [[gay|faggy]] [[tl;dr|journal]] entry made about how [[lie|hard]] his life is and how [[denial|paranoia]] is an excuse for everything and how talking to a councilor of a [[retard|special]] school is the same as a licensed therapist.

==The Legend of Foxon: The [[Shit]] [[babyfur|Maker]]==
As well as his [[asspie]] behavior and [[BPD|paranoia]], Foxon is also notorious for his [[shit]] and [[piss]] fetishes. He is immensely turned on from [[jenkem|the smell of his own shit]], dosen't see anything wrong with living in a room that [[what|smells like piss]] and is an admitted and [[oxymoron|proud babyfur]]. As seen somewhere within the quotes section below, Foxon used to sleep with a [[Kitsune Youkai|plushie that was supposed to be his sister]] which he [[piss|marked]] regularly. Eventually the smell was bad enough to almost peel the paint off the walls so his mom washed it. When Foxon learned of this, he [[raged]], [[BAWW]]'d and [[emo|slashed his wrists]] over it. After screaming at his mom about it for a few hours, he cut off the plushies tail (his [[plushie|sister's]] name was foxtail [[irony|get it lol]]?) and threw it away. In a much later journal entry, he later claimed that his mom forced him to throw it away  (because that's SO much less embarrassing than doing it yourself).

{{Squote|Well I've only washed her twice... in months i've had her. That may sound gross but hear me out. I know it's kind of embarrassing but Zearoth or someone of nature would understand. I enjoy scents, its how foxes know their mates, territory, etc. So if my plushie has a certain scent it makes me happier.

Yes, in short, I marked her a while back and it stunk up my room but I was happy... after a huge blowup and fight with my mother I was FORCED to let my mother wash it becaue it was "Rather it gets washed or I'm throwingit out!" *whimpers* parents are so mean...|Foxon|color=silver|size=360%}}

==The End of Foxon's Internet Life==
===[[deviantART]]===
[[Last Thursday]], Foxon discovered that not everyone likes him.  He discovered [http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_fa/1115294.html this gem]: a livejournal entry bashing him and his embarrassingly bad art and stories.  Because it's a totally reasonable reaction to have, he [[Oh noes|QUIT DA FOREVER]]!!1!11  This is simply further proof of Foxon's (and all babyfurs, really) inability to act in mature ways.  What do you expect from someone who thinks shitting himself is cute?  
<center>{{bigpic|Foxon quits.png|500|200}}</center>

===[[Fur Affinity]]===
[[image:FoxonEDEditing.png|right|thumb|He mad.]]
[[Image:Foxon edit.png|right|thumb|And again.]]
[[image:FoxonEDBombed.png|thumb|right|Foxon asking for white knights]]

This wasn't enough. Someone decided it would be lulzy to ED bomb his FurAffinity.
<br/>[[image:FoxonEDJournal2.png|600px|center|The result.]]<br/>
Expecting the '''entire fandom''' to submit to his every whim and desire, Foxon took on the entire furry fandom in the form of the demand "If you want me to stay, give me reasons why!". Obviously Foxon doesn't realise how [[unrealistic expectations|unrealistic these expectations are]].

He also went and deleted almost all of his submissions and all of his page comments. Also, he now wants any [[None|remaining friends]] of his to white knight for him. Now he's [[quitting IRC forever|quit furry forever]] he will probably (and hopefully) become [[an hero]].

{{Quote|I appear as a silver fox with bandage wraps, but did you know that I'm [[Insane|half dragon]]? I'm actually what my name is, I'm a [[fuck you im a dragon|Fox-dragon]]; a "[[Spastic|Foxon]]".

I am a full silver fox, no draconic attributes or traits, but I have the blood of the dragon from a transfusion I had with one that gave me my elven abilities in magic. (Irl, I do know bits of the elven language, so I can only cast spells that I know. Further knowledge, more spells).

I do, however, have wings. I don't show them, and it is actually a spell to use them. the spell is, "Uru'loki [[Raep|Ripa]]." to summon my wings. They [[erection|grow]] out of my back until they are fully grown, takes only a few seconds and is no pain.

My wings are sceathers, so feathers instead of membranes, and they are completely silver to match my body. From lack of use, I have little to know acrobatic ability with them, just normal flying and gliding.|Foxon, on his [[No|TOTALLY ORIGINAL]] fursona.}}

That's just touching base with what i'm really going through with the whole laziness thing, but you'll all learn that my journals are long and very personal... so, just don't read em if you don't like them. ^^;|Foxon, on [[MOAR]] [[PROTIPS]]|

I was thinking of doing writing commissions for people. Maybe not full stories because they take way too long, but I was thinking like small 1000-3000 word short stories that are pure yiff for a small price like 10-20 dollars.

Back in November I deleted my level 70 druid for this same upsetting suicidal behavior and drama. It hit me again and I wasted three whole months of my life.|Because [[WoW]] is worth killing yourself over.|

I hope I get the swine flu and die.|Don't we all?|

Well, my parents might force me to go because I have no babysitter even though I'm fuckin 18. My parents don't think I'm mature enough. I don't want to be dragged anywhere this summer. It's Florida or broke...|Wow, what asshole parents! It's not like you're a suicidal [[babyfur]] or something, [[amirite]]?|

I';ve NEVER BEEN SCAMMED IN MY LIFE out of money becsause I'm more secure than they are and I continue to stay that way...|Yep, never been scammed. Ignore the plushie you [[HAHAHA, OH WOW|spend hundreds on]] that never came.|

I dont suggest drinking Cat nip. it tastes a lot like minty tea, quite good actually if you add some sugur. But it gives u bad headaches and no high. We didnt hellucinate but was fun =3|

The Cat nip in humans doesnt make you go crazy or speed up like crack, it mellows you out. The more mellow you get, the higher you get (eventually you see hellucinations) but at about 2am or 3am last night I started to get INSANELY hyper... I'm not even kidding. I was talking about... blood and seed sucking were-pirates and jumping up like super mario and.... oh shit, lots of things... >.>

Anyone who knows me irl, knows this is NOT the Foxon I am. XD|well of course not, the Foxon we all know is far to emo for expressing anything except [[emo|soul rending]] pain.|

There's nothing wrong with me through my eyes, sure I'm a little strange but we're all into our own things. ^^|Whats the matter, can't see your diapers past all the scars on your arms?|

Well I've only washed her twice... in months i've had her. That may sound gross but hear me out. I know it's kind of embarrassing but Zearoth or someone of nature would understand. I enjoy scents, its how foxes know their mates, territory, etc. So if my plushie has a certain scent it makes me happier.

Moving in withsomeone is very perminent. We have had many quarrels in the past but he still (by this offer) thinks that I would be worth LIVING with? I was speechless.|us too|

*cries* can we always be this nice to each other like this? There's no need for violence among us. I did already make my incantation in that one email. i bound myself through elven magic to your future pregnancy so whether I like it or not, I gave you my most sincere blessings. Thanks for apolgizing Cat. ^_^|GEEZ KITSUNE, HE USED ELVEN MAGIC AND EVERYTHING!|

I can't pay for Linden or whatever currency SL uses because my parents forbid me from using their card when I last stole their card to get points on Requiem (only 10 bucks....) to help my depression (I was severely depressed that day...)|[[No|Stealing is ok if you're depressed]].|

For three years I've wanted to be a ninja and this year I might do it! I just now started looking for a costume... so on short-notice, I may not get it...|[[HABEEB IT]]!|


So, before you comment, think of this: Will I approve of your comment? If I can get advice or critisism out of it, [[lie|I won't block you]]. If you are just saying "WTF is wrong with you?" You get the blocker.|Foxon on being [[trolled|trollbait]].|

Soooo... piss off you flamers. The one that pissed me off the most might be "If you don't like flames, don't put logs on the fire." I told him something like 'Go to hell you fuckin tree.' I know, horrible come-back, but I found it funny. X3|Foxon, on being [[trolled|trollbait]] (continued).|

Now, this is my MOTHER I'm talking about. She took two important items, both sentimentally and emotionally attached to me. She took them WITHOUT PERMISSION on more than one occassion... and had no respect for it. I used those items in my times of depression (when I break down) and she still things I shouldn't have them.
I'm a babyfur technically. I don't do it irl but online I do have a cub form. The items that she took were two pacifiers that I bought with my own allowance one day months ago. They help me feel better when I'm emotionally depressed... but she won't accept that they're mine and she won't get past it...|time for the trusty [[suicide|xacto knife]].|

She then said that she was EAGER for me to move so she wouldn't have to care about me anymore. She also said that she didn't want me for Christmasb and that we may not even have one this year because I put no effort into my family and I dont desurve a Christmas.|Foxon on having the best mom ever.|

Remove it........... it's MY CHARACTER and you don't have permission to use my character! DELET IT|DELET IT|

I have no way to escape my drama from my fuckin ex unless I leave the fuckin fandom or force people to stop talking to him so I can at least have friends...

I'm fucked...|Coleton Gower|

Sure, I'm not a full baby fur, but pacis and diapers (not right now mind you... because of my parents ~.~) are okay by me...|well thank god you're not a FULL FLEDGED BABYFUR and are only into diapers and pacis|

I wish some people...Would wipe themselves off the face of the internet and the earth. They do nothing but cause drama, bring sorrow, bring pain, and do nothing but suck up to others and vice versa. So many people I wish could just... go away...|hmmn... people on the internet who cause drama, sorrow, pain and does nothing but suck up to others... now who does that sound like?|

So I watched 1Man1Jar... i thought "lol so he's bleeding... big whoop" and I was laughing while Metal was going "Disgusting!"

Then my eyes started to blurr... I then went blind for 10 seconds...

Then my hearing faded to nothing....

Then my eyes were closed and the next thing I knew, I was hunched over Daggas's computer desk in front of me; I passed out from the sheer sight of all the blood and imagining the pain.....|Foxon on [[1man1jar]]|

because when I get home I MUST get on WoW cuz I'm too paranoid my "hunny" will be doing something I hate, which is everything.|Foxon on relationships.|

This behavior of paranoia started OVER A FUCKING YEAR AGO! It started on April first of 2008, the declared Worst day of my life. It also got worst when my "hunny" left back for home on August 2nd. I spent 3 months in depression from missing him so much, and then November we started doing the whole break-up, get back together loop... so I've been suicidal since November of 2008. It got to a constant point by February, and now I'm going out of my way to get knives and almost attempting suicide.|Foxon on how cybering is [[srs bsns]].

|I'm tired of being shit on and being treated LIKE shit. I quit this bullshit fandom and the drama along with it. You guys wanna see someone rage quit and "bawww"? Fine. Enjoy my tears and endless pain. I hope every one of you fuckers named above BURN IN HELL AND DIE A SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH!!
