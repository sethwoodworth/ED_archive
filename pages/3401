Goldfish
[[Image:Freshly_Caught_Goldfish.jpg|thumb|Here is how big your average goldfish gets.]] 
A '''goldfish''' can be many things:

* <s>A small, bowl-housed pet that is low-maintenance,</s> A hard to care for pet that grows to at least a foot long, needs 100 gallon tank at full size, lives for 20 years, and is usually kept by most fucking stupid retards who end up killing it in ten days by keeping it in a fish bowl.
* A tasty crunchy cracker snack with a face that smiles at you.
* A bloodthirsty wild beast that has a singular goal: to kill Dan Rather.
* A [[dildo]]-shaped object that fits snugly [[in the ass]].
