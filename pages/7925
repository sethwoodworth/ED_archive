Surgipedia
'''Surgipedia''' is a parody of [[Wikipedia_Policies_and_Guidelines|fucked up Wikipedia policies]] currently making the rounds on teh [[Internets]]. Unlike Wikipedia-generated parodies of itself, which are uniformly [[unfunny]], Surgipedia is actually lulzworthy. For this reason, Surgipedia is not likely to find its way onto [[BJAODN]] anytime soon.

== Teh Joke ==

Several [[Wikipedian|Surgipedians]] have gathered in an operating theater. On the table lies an unconscious man whose left leg looks dark. Surgipedian #1 grabs a sheet prepared by the patient's doctor that details the problem.

Surgipedian #1: "Whoa, he's been lying here for 26 hours, we sure got a backlog again. It also says on this that he has a 'claudication' and a 'chronic venous insufficiency' in the left leg", looks at right leg, "and we are asked to do a 'leg segmental arterial doppler ultrasound exam'. Whatever that is. His leg looks pretty good to me".

Surgipedian #2: "You looked at the wrong leg. It says the left one".

Surgipedian #1: "I looked at the left and it's looking totally normal!"

Surgipedian #2: "The left from his [[POV|point of view]]! Do you know where your left leg is?"

Surgipedian #3: "No need for shouting, #2, please remember Surgipedia guideline [[Wikipedia:Assume Good Faith|'Assume Good Faith']]. #1 was just trying to be constructive!"

Surgipedian #2: "I was only trying to be constructive, too!"

Surgipedian #3: "Well, let's just get to back to this guy."

Surgipedian #1, feeling securely at the helm again: "I remember something I read once on a website about heart diseases; when your arms or legs turn dark, you got a heart problem".

[[Fake editor|Surgipedian #3]]: "Yup, you are right. It's something about the veins in the heart being clogged up."

Surgipedian #2, feeling outdone: "I think it's something about having not enough oxygen in your blood!"

Surgipedian #1: "[[Citation needed|Can you cite a source for that?]]"

Surgipedian #2: "My aunt Thelma had something like that and I wrote a paper about it for my biology class at school!"

Surgipedian #3: "Please remember Surgipedia guideline: No Original Research! Let's get back to the man's heart problem! What should we do?"

Surgipedian #1: "I think you need to cut open his ribs and give him a heart massage or clean the veins or something".

Surgipedian #3: "Sounds reasonable. After all, when you get a massage to your back, the blood there flows better as well. I just wrote an article about it".

Surgipedian #2: "Heh, that is original research, too!"

Surgipedian #3: "Several Surgipedians agreed on that article to be correct. Are you trying to be a nuisance or do you want to do that man some good?"

Surgipedian #2: "Of course!"

Surgipedian #3: "Then please stay constructive! How do we cut the man's ribs?"

Surgipedian #1: "You need a saw or something."

Surgipedian #3: "A saw? Surgeons use scalpels when they operate. I think you just need to cut a hole and poke your fingers through".

Without further ado, he grabs a scalpel and cuts a hole approximately where the heart is and sticks two fingers through.

Surgipedian #3: "I can't reach the heart, my fingers are not long enough!"

Surgipedian #2: "Then do that thing with the veins!"

Surgipedian #3: "How do you do that?"

Surgipedian #2 "Well, my aunt Thelma finally had something they call a bypass and [[Some argue|they cut open the veins, I think."]]

Surgipedian #3: "But that is orig..., well let's try it. But I will have to push in the scalpel pretty deep to reach the heart. Shall we do it?"

Surgipedian #1, #2: "Support."

Surgipedian #3 remembers Surgipedia guideline [[Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages|"Be Bold!"]], grabs the scalpel in his fist and swings his arm in preparation for a deep push into the hole, but at that moment a [[non-notable|surgeon]] comes by.

Surgeon: "Stop! What in the world are you doing?"

Surgipedian #3: The man has a problem in his leg and we are going to cut his heart veins open."

Surgeon: "What? All I see is a man with vascular problem in his leg and another that wields a scalpel like a knife. Are you aware that pushing a scalpel into someone's heart will kill that person?"

Surgipedian #1: "We have decided by majority that this is the proper thing to do. Besides, can you prove that pushing a scalpel into someones heart is deadly?"

Surgeon: "You decided by MAJORITY? Are you all nuts?"

Surgipedian #2 feels that there is [[Completely irrelevant history|finally someone besides him to put down]]: "Please, no personal attacks!"

Surgeon: "I will fucking personal attack you if you endanger someone's life!"

Surgipedian #3: "We need to call an [[bureaucratic fuck|admin]]!"

Surgeon: "Alright, do that, but put that scalpel down!"

An [[Wikipedophile|admin]] comes by.

[[Jimbo Wales|Admin]]: "I have heard that a guest is violating Surgipedia rules".

Surgeon: "I am a surgeon and these people are about to kill this man by pushing a knife into his heart!"

Admin: "Reviewing the archived discussion, you are in violation of rules Surgipedia:Assume Good Faith, [[Vandalism|Surgipedia:Vandalism]], [[NPOV|Surgipedia:Neutral Point of View]], [[Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks|Surgipedia:No Personal Attacks]], [[Some argue|Surgipedia:Avoid Weasel Words]] and Surgipedia:Do not disrupt Surgipedia to make a point. You will be [[banhammer|blocked]] from accessing Surgipedia for one week. Please use the time to review [[Wikipedia_Policies_and_Guidelines|Surgipedia guidelines and rules]]."

[[fucktard|Admin]] and desperate Surgeon leave.

Surgipedian #3: "Okay, where were we?"

Surgipedian #2: "You were about to cut his heart."

Surgipedian #3: "Yup. I propose that so-called 'surgeon' was just a [[troll]] and we should go ahead."

Surgipedian #1 and #2: "Agree."

Surgipedian #3 slams the scalpel into the man's heart, who is dead within moments.

Surgipedian #3: "Why did he die?"

Surgipedian #1: "It's his fault. There was nothing WE did wrong!"

Surgipedian #3: "Maybe we should add him to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_deaths recent deaths] list.

Surgipedian #2: "Nah, he's just not [[notable]] enough."
