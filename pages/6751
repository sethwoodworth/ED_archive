[[RFJason]] (Jason Fortuny) and {{lj|demure}} conducted an experiment. They posted an ad on the [[Seattle]] area [[Craigslist]] to see what kind of responses they could get, although it is strongly suspected by some [[faggots]] that the entire project was used as an attempt by Fortuny to fuck {{lj|demure}} [[in the ass]] (success rate undetermined.) A similar scientific study was done on the [[CosmicJohn CL Experiment|Portland Craigslist]] by another person who is not Jason Fortuny.

In the end, the experiment proved that a lot of guys [[OTI]] are into kinky sex with hot chicks. [[Common knowledge|STOP THE FUCKING PRESSES.]]

__NOTOC__

== The Experiment ==
Here is the ad verbatim, with pic:

Once it was posted, they sat back and enjoyed the responses. The 
[http://rfjason.livejournal.com/410835.html original thread] is available on livejournal.

==From small prank to huge debate==
Originally just a small prank by [[RFJason]] and demure, the entire thing exploded to the point of being [[old meme]]. Fortuny's LJ entry received hundreds of comments fast, then it was picked up by [[waxy.org]]. From there it went on to [[Wired]]. From there it went on to [[Fark]] and the [[BBC]] and countless other places. A New York Times article is in the works.

===Ethics 101===
The replies to [[blog]] postings have ranged from Jason Fortuny is a jerk (he's even been called sexist, don't ask us on this one) to the men deserved it to ''both''. {{lj|demure}}'s involvement in the whole thing has been ignored by the bloggers and the commentors for the most part. Perhaps the reason this whole thing has gotten so big is because of all the debate snowballing this into a net phenomenon.

The ethical debate continues to rage.  The Associated Press consulted the [[Craigslist]] [[CEO]], an Oxford/[[Harvard]] [[Internet law|law]] professor, and an [[EFF]] staff attorney for their wire piece.  Regarding Fortuny's postings, "It's one of those questions that could find its way onto a law school exam because it is comparatively new territory," [law professor] Zittrain said.  Fortuny's liability under Washington state law, [EFF staff attorney Kurt Opsahl] said, rests on whether the disclosures are of legitimate concern to the public. "As far as I know, they (the respondents) are not public figures, so it would be challenging to show that this was something of public concern," Opsahl said.

It should be noted that everyone who responded with personal information/[[cock]] pics/from a [[work]] address should return their internet. [[Ted Stevens]] is looking for a new one.

===Impact on ED===
Encyclopedia Dramatica has been mentioned in some sources by name, some as just a satire site hosting the images with no link.  An [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/fn/4179361.html AP wire story] says "Fortuny then posted all the replies on a Web site devoted to parodies and satires online." An MSNBC piece featuring ED and is available on [[YouTube]], by [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y6LqhrdAxg clicking here]. The piece shows a user scrolling through ED while blurring out the images, additionally, in the browser's address bar "ENCYCLOPEDIADRAMATICA.COM" is digially added in large, black, bold letters. MSNBC apparently uses a new kind of ie only availble to news stations. The local [[Seattle]] television news went so far as to interview one of the respondents. [[RFJason_CL_Experiment#firas_hazimeh|Firas Hazimeh]] who refers to himself as "Nate" is interviewed on the Komo station and talks about his experience. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O4qeWF9sPE&e See the clip]

ED's [[alexa]]rank peaked at 1246, receiving tens of hits every second. The server strain caused the need to turn off logins, most images, and edits after much downtime.  The article received 90K views before being deleted and restored. You can see the current amount of views at the bottom of this page.

===The Saga of Jerry and "Wife"===
* [http://rfjason.livejournal.com/411436.html Official thread]

Jerry has already contacted me by e-mail, demanding I remove all traces of him from my post. This appears to be an anonymous reply from him in my LJ: http://rfjason.livejournal.com/410835.html?thread=7629011#t7629011

Jerry claims he has an open marriage. Can anyone confirm/deny this?

Edit: Update. Jerry and his "wife" contacted me on AIM

====Part I: Email conversation with Jerry====
<span class="co;[Collapse];[Expand];0;RF1"></span>
<span class="RF1">

;From Jerry@emailaddress.com
:> You will remove the pictures of me from your stupid craigslist experiment.
:> My wife and I have an open relationship, don\'t believe me? Contact her and
:> ask her. But you will remove me, you have no right to post this kind of crap
:> without first knowing the full details. Here is the bullshit i want you to
:> remove: http://rfjason.livejournal.com/410835.html?thread=7600851..t7600851

;From Jason
:Why should I?

;From Jerry@emailaddress.com
:Because I would appreciate it, because my wife and I have an open relationship
:and I would never "cheat" on her. Because we play with others to enhance our
:own relationship. Because she is fully aware of what goes on. And again
:because I'd appreciate it.
:
:I don't want to fight this out with you, I understand why you're doing
:this - to husbands that actually cheat, however, I wouldn't do that - my wife 
:and I are fully participating swingers, now please remove the thread.

;From Jason
:Well, if anything, this should help you meet MORE people.

;From Jerry@emailaddress.com
:And it's not the way I want it done. So you have no intentions of removing it
:then? That's fine, I'll ignore it and move on with my life.

;From Jason
:Wait, I thought you were going to sue me?

;From Jerry@emailaddress.com
:I'll look into all my options, and if I choose legal recourse, it
:wouldn't be a
:lawsuit. It would be a criminal case, if that didn't work, then I imagine I'd
:have to settle for a civil suit. But either way, this is the last time I
:communicate with you. I have nothing more to say - by even responding in the
:first place I gave you what you want, and that was foolish of me.

:[10:29] JrITadmin69: Just the man I was looking for.
:[10:30] RFJason: Hi Jerry. I just replied to your e-mail.
:[10:30] JrITadmin69: and i replied to yours
:[10:30] JrITadmin69: Look, I understand what you're trying to do with your experiment.
:[10:31] JrITadmin69: And I don't take offense, other then that you didn't attempt to get the whole story, and jumped to conclusions.
:[10:31] RFJason: I didn't jump to any conclusions.
:[10:31] JrITadmin69: And I learned my lesson as well, don't include my face anymore, assuming my wife and i decide to continue with our lifestyle.
:[10:31] JrITadmin69: Sure you did, you assumed I was cheating on my wife without her knowing what was going on.
:[10:32] RFJason: I don't really care what lessons you learned.
:[10:32] JrITadmin69: So then all you really do care about is hurting people.
:[10:32] JrITadmin69: Gotcha.
:[10:33] RFJason: I don't think I'm hurting anyone.
:[10:33] JrITadmin69: You don't think slandering my name isn't hurting me, or my wife?
:[10:33] RFJason: How is this slader?
:[10:34] JrITadmin69: by saying i'm cheating
:[10:35] RFJason: When did I say you're cheating?
:[10:35] JrITadmin69: it doesnt matter, I'm not going to give this any more attention.
:[10:36] JrITadmin69: My wife knows the truth, and thats what matters to me
:[10:36] JrITadmin69: the rest, I just don't care
:[10:36] JrITadmin69: that thread is full of unverified crap
:[10:36] JrITadmin69: i love my wife, she loves me - thats what matters
:[10:37] RFJason: For anyone who has said "unverified crap", you may respond to them directly. Please point out where I wrote "unverified crap" about you.
:[10:39] JrITadmin69: The mere fact that you posted pictures of me without my permission - and then assuming that i'd have a "skank" pretend to be my wife
:[10:39] JrITadmin69: the entire post is meant to infer that i'm cheating
:[10:39] JrITadmin69: you're facilitating the entire process
:[10:39] RFJason: But where did I actually say you're cheating?
:[10:39] JrITadmin69: look it doesnt matter, you can pretend to be innocent in the entire thing
:[10:40] JrITadmin69: you may not have directly said it yourself
:[10:40] JrITadmin69: but what was the purpose of your experiment in the first place?
:[10:40] JrITadmin69: But honestly, I may have to contact my attorney
:[10:40] JrITadmin69: Just to see if I have any legal recourse
:[10:41] JrITadmin69: Since you did post pictures of me without my consent.
:[10:42] RFJason: go for it.
:[10:42] JrITadmin69: And if I do.. I can gurantee my wife would be standing next to me in any court appearances.
:[10:42] RFJason: ok.
:[10:42] JrITadmin69: All I asked was for a simple thing, remove the thread
:[10:42] RFJason: You let me know when that lawyer thing happens.
:[10:42] JrITadmin69: Is that really so difficult?
:[10:42] RFJason: You have no idea.
:[10:44] JrITadmin69: Whatever, I'm done with this. Have fun continuing your fucked up crusade.
:[10:45] RFJason: Hey thanks!
:[10:45] RFJason: What's your lawyer's name and number, just so I know to pick up the phone or sign for his letter?
:[10:49] RFJason: Jerry, do you even have a lawyer lined up, or is it an empty internet threat?
:[10:51] JrITadmin69: Before I get to that, I have a few other options available to me
:[10:52] JrITadmin69: such as contacting livejournal, I'm not even sure if they allow nudity
:[10:52] RFJason: You'll want to check the TOS.
:[10:52] JrITadmin69: I will.
:[10:57] JrITadmin69: You agree to NOT use the Service to:

:[10:58] RFJason: Looks like you have some work to do, Jerry!
:[10:58] CMAITGuy: http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=112
:[11:00] JrITadmin69: http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=107
:[11:00] JrITadmin69: so it does appear that you're in violation
:[11:00] JrITadmin69: looks good to me, time to hit the phone
:[11:00] RFJason: I'm glad you feel empowered.
:[11:00] JrITadmin69: all i want is the thread removed, but if i even have a chance to have your account banned, then hey, cool.
:[11:01] RFJason: So why are you still here talking to me? GIT R DONE!

====Part III: IM Conversation with Mrs. Jerry====
<span class="co;[Collapse];[Expand];0;RF3"></span>
<span class="RF3">

:[10:30] Trinity069: this is heidi, the wife of jerry...
:[10:30] RFJason: Yes, I'm sure it is. Pls stand by while we independently verify Jerry's status.
:[10:31] Trinity069: who are you and how do you know either of us
:[10:37] Trinity069: who are you?
:[10:37] RFJason: Oh, I'm just a gigolo, and everywhere I go, people know the part I'm playin...
:[10:38] Trinity069: how do you know us...why would you start this forum
:[10:38] RFJason: Paid for every dance, selling each romance. Ooooh what they sayin?
:[10:38] Trinity069: respond with a real answer
:[10:39] RFJason: That's about as real as it gets, since your identity as Jerry's wife cannot be verified here. You might be Jerry for all I know.
:[10:40] Trinity069: well its Heidi, whats your number and I can call you later this evening, my cell doesn't have service right now
:[10:42] RFJason: Oh hi, "Heidi". That will not help me independently verify Jerry's marital status.
:[10:42] Trinity069: how the hell do I prove im his wife
:[10:43] Trinity069: I really want this to stop
:[10:43] RFJason: You don't. That's why I keep using the word INDEPENDENTLY.
:[10:43] Trinity069: well than what can I do
:[10:43] RFJason: Pretty much nothing.
:[10:43] Trinity069: nothing...
:[10:43] RFJason: Jerry says he's going to get a lawyer.
:[10:43] Trinity069: can I ever
:[10:44] Trinity069: cant you just delete, it isn't your life
:[10:45] Trinity069: you are being such a jerk.....
:[10:45] Trinity069: and very difficutl
:[10:46] RFJason: No, it's really simple. When Jerry's lawyer comes around we can begin the year long process of deposition and pre-trial hearings. I'm sure Jerry's photos will be very old meme by then.
:[10:47] Trinity069: just delete it, what the hell do you get out of it by being such a jerk
:[10:47] RFJason: I don't know. Love?
:[10:49] Trinity069: love..?
:[10:49] RFJason: I really have no idea. I just took a blind guess.
:[10:50] Trinity069: whatever
:[10:51] RFJason: Yeah, pretty much.
:[10:51] RFJason: It was nice talking to you "Heidi."
:[10:52] Trinity069: well it wasn't nice talking to you...people like you are...
:[10:53] RFJason: trying to independently verify Jerry's status.
:[10:54] Trinity069: what good will that do, you don't believe me anyway
:[10:55] RFJason: Yes, that's why we're INDEPENDENTLY verifying Jerry's status.
:[10:56] RFJason: Heidi, can you define "independently" for me?
:[10:56] Trinity069: no I dont' know what it means!!!!!!
:[10:59] RFJason: Ah. That would explain why you're having a hard time understanding me.
:[10:59] Trinity069: all of you go to hell, jerry and I will move on from this, because none of its true, and besides hurtful words, you have not succeded in anything by your damn forum you felt you had to start and feel the need to keep...
:[11:00] RFJason: Wait, does this mean you're not going to sue us?
:[11:01] Trinity069: no didn't say that
:[11:02] Trinity069: im done talking to you, im getting no where no matter how hard I try...you made your point, you contacted me on myspace and are even talking to me, and still won't delete it so you are just a total jerk and must get a thrill out of hurting people
:[11:02] Trinity069: good people
:[11:02] RFJason: I never contacted you on myspace.
:[11:03] Trinity069: oh well two other people did, someone sent me the links of jerrys ad and your damn forum
:[11:03] RFJason: Ah. Good internet soldiers, they are.

Edit: Update 2: Jerry, you sent cockpix from your emailaddress.com address. WHOIS says that domain is the "REDACTED". YOU SICK FUCK! http://rfjason.livejournal.com/410835.html?thread=7641811#t7641811

Edit: Update 3: here is Jerry's e-correspondence with me. He is going to seek criminal charges.

====Part IV: E-Court with Jerry and RFJason====
Jerry is now [http://rfjason.livejournal.com/412185.html going to sue] RFJason in [[e-court]]. Judge Lollercaust will preside.

:<I>OMG I just talked to Jerry on the phone. Oh how I wish there was a way to record phone conversations on my cell phone. Let's just say Jerry is freaking out. He wants all of his stuff removed, but he's already filed a complaint with LJ_Abuse, but he wants all of his stuff removed. His lawyer is Mr. Smart out of Yakima. Jerry will contact Mr. Smart shortly and Mr. Smart will send me some kind of registered mail, I'm sure. Jerry has also promised that my publicly available information will remain ... publicly available. Yeah. It was a very pleasant conversation. Jerry's a nice guy! We're just having a little disagreement over what should be done next.</i>
