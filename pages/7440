Shay
'''Shay''' was a 485 pound mule who stirred up a lot of drama by being [[fat]] and smelly and eventually [[dead]]. The story involved {{lj|Shiroioji}}, Statik, and Dereck.

Go into the article ready to laugh at Shay.  She was in the wrong, because she is [[fat]].

Ugh and all the shitting in this Shay needs to be [[killed with fire]].

== The Early Years ==
Shay and Shiroioji met [[100 years ago]] on the interwebs, through a [[gay]]/[[lesbian]] parenting community she had been very active in. She mostly wrote about raising her son, Shane, as a single [[lesbian]]. They [[Cyber|talked online]] actively, until they both acquired cell phones. Often times, while Shay and Shiroioji were on the phone, Shay's son, Shane, would [[pedophilia|chat with  Shiroioji]] on the computer.

Shay was soon kicked out of her house by her evil [[grandmother]], rumored to be [[this_is_warmth]]. She, in the typical fatass style, went from place to place staying with friends, generally being a disgusting burden on everyone. But this did not last long, and she soon asked Shiroioji to stay at his place, and get her bearings. He agreed, thinking he would get [[Laid|some]].

== Shay: the Friend, the Roommate, the Smell ==
Upon moving in with Shiroioji, the house started to smell like "dirt and rotting vegtables". This was supposedly due to a [[Disease|hormonal imbalance]], "which would mean that she had a [[Ass|bum]] full of [[shit]] that couldn't be [[Douche|wiped]]". After  Shiroioji got in trouble with his landlord he arranged for her to stay with one of his friends, and she would have a job to pay rent. Sounds like a fair arrangement, [[amirite]]?

Well, she soon got in trouble with the new landlords as well due to the stink, causing drama in the complex, and being an overall fat burdensome animal. 

This is what sparked a chain of events.

== The Beginning of the End ==
Shiroioji received an [[e-mail]] from Shay saying that she was going to "[[Self pwn|do what she had to do]]", and then an e-mail from her son, saying she was going to hurt herself, so he called 911. Upon arriving to her house, they found she had downed a bottle of Valerian root, and arrested her, although nobody could figure out how they got handcuffs around her basketball wrists. Later, Shiroioji called her father.

[[Tl;dr]], her father is actually her step father, and she has no son. Shane was just Shay pretending to be a boy. None of the friends she's ever stayed with have met him. The reason for this is because he [[abortion|died soon after birth]], being too small. Her body was so gluttonous that it actually denied the boy nutrients in the womb. As Shiroioji wrote, she "took the fun out of dysfunction".

SO, back to the real reason we're here. She left Statik's place a mess. So, Shay being Shiroioji's friend first, he went to help.

Basically, it went like this: [[Period|menstrual blood]], shit stains EVERYWHERE, one duffel bag full of food trash and more [[shit]], another duffel bag containing two 2-litre bottles of urine and assorted waste. The bed sheets were stuck together with diarrhea dried between them. Apparently she has slept in this for several days. If a professional cleaning crew was called to make a budget, it would have probably amounted to [[Over_9000|at least $9,001]].

== Home Jenkem Factory ==
The [[old|new]] found drug [[Jenkem]] prompted officials to research Shay from the evidence of bottles filled with collected Jenkem. It turns out that Shay forced herself to have diarrhea so she could mass produce Jenkem. She would then go to the middle school nearest her and sell the Jenkem for $10 dollars a dose. The police caught on but it was too late...

== Death ==

[[Image:Shay2.jpg|thumb|NEVAR FORGET!!!]]

Shortly afterwords, Shay shit the bed, figuratively this time.  She was found dead on the floor near a multitude of candy wrappers. She died from [[diabeetus|diabetic]] [[barrel roll|overdrive]] or some shit, which is Latin for eating yourself to death because you're a damn fatass. [[Noone|No one]] was sorry. They decided to [[kill it with fire|burn her body]] like they would any dead mule, but the fire lasted so long from burning off the fats that the apartment complex caught fire (damn, amirite?).
