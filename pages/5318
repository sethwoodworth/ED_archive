'''Metafilter''' (found at '''www.boyzone.info''') is a niche site targeted towards the underrepresented demographic of [[Liberal|white rape-apologists with credit cards]]. Originally a SEO spam site that stole its content from Fark, it has since developed into what could charitably be described as an [[Juggalo|"AIDS Volcano."]]

== Mods ==
[[Image:Hill_giant.jpg|thumb|The Metafilter mod team ready for action]]
Like a bonsai tree of failure, Metafilter is carefully [[BME|pruned]] to meet the standards of its mods. If you ever wondered what kind of person would actually want their website to be like jayisgames with concern-trolling [[Fake_Bisexual|Registered Democrats]], read on.

*'''mathowie''' created the site in order to talk about his two passions: [[Buttsecks|professional wrestling]] and [[Chris_Benoit|auto-erotic asphyxiation]]. He will often PM members of the site to boast about how good he is at watching television.
*'''Jessamyn''', in addition to her "work" on the site (which consists of deleting ask.metafilter answers written by known [[No_girls_on_the_internet|women]],) is a librarian in some tiny New England shithole. Due to her efforts, the library is empty of everything except [[Gor]] novels.
*'''Cortex''' once paid $5000 for a [[fursuit]], then wrote an album of [[Klingon]] [[Linkin_Park|folk songs]] about it.
*A couple of '''other guys.'''

== Memes ==
Metafilter is the last stop before [[your mom]] on the old meme train. This is due to the fact that they pulled a train on your mom. There is some indication that they might get past goatse and Monica Lewinsky jokes by 2014.

== Ask Metafilter ==
[[Has_anyone_really_been_far_even_as_decided_to_use_even_go_want_to_do_look_more_like?|Ask Metafilter]], the site’s popular advice page, is useful for swift responses to your IT questions. Relationship questions are a different matter:

<pre>Dear Metafilter,
I am a 20 year old lesbian who has just moved to a new town, and I'm too
young for the bar scene. How should I meet other gay women?
-anonymous

Dear anonymous,
Sometimes relationships can go seriously wrong.  What if the other woman is not really gay?  You definitely need to lawyer up.
-ParisianSnowflake

Dear anonymous,
I'm a straight guy, but I'm sure I can answer your question. You see, blah
blah blah friendzone blah blah ladder theory blah blah George Sodini was right blah blah blah.
-AwsumDood39

Dear anonymous,
Have you considered therapy?
-SelfSatisfiedAndIntellectuallyLazy

Dear anonymous,
You need to find Jesus!
-Konolia</pre>

Ask Metafilter’s [[Buttsecks|Human Relations]] tag is dominated by [[Protest-chan|“anonymous”]] questions from confused souls asking, for example, whether they should be troubled that their husband wants to engage in wife-swapping or their the[[rapist]] has recommended that they join a [[Christian|vegan sex cult]]. In all cases expect the recommendation to be more [[Gay_rehab|therapy]]. When the questions aren't from [[Fake_bisexual|invisible lesbians]] and insufferable sad sacks whining about how much they, as middle-class Americans, have it worse than starving African [[7chan|AIDS]] [[Babyfuck|baby rape]] victims, they're from equally insufferable [[Nice Guys]] who want to know how best to get away with date [[raep]]. Any [[Chris_Hansen|known woman]] caught [[Asking_for_it|asking a question]] about her relationship will rightfully be called a slut over and over, until her post is deleted by Jessamyn, who can't stand the thought that her [[Centipedes|centipede-infected vagina]] isn't the only one on MetaFilter.

== Taking Offense ==

At Metafilter, the residents cherish the chance to express offense on behalf of vegans, feminists and other stock campus leftist types. This is an attempt on behalf of most "MeFites" to relive their wasted youths by pretending that they have any knowledge or understanding of [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|current political issues]], rather than face the fact that they're a bunch of [[World_of_Warcraft|pasty, overweight, middle-aged cube-dwellers]] who spend their evenings masturbating to [[Kimmo_Johan_Alm|CP]] before [[Dying_alone|crying themselves to sleep]]. Though most members of MetaFilter will pretend to be [[Ron_Paul|cowardly liberals]], almost all of them are in fact [[50_Hitler_Post|Nazis]], and probably [[Chris_Chan|furries]] as well.

In the wake of particularly [[Butthurt|traumatic]] front page posts, huge swaths of comments on the sub-section [[Boychat|MetaTalk]] are devoted to working out just how offended people are. One recent enormous MetaTalk thread, for example, devolved into a [[Tl;dr|tedious and arcane discussion]] of how offended [[Camwhores|feminist theorists]] should be if [[Linetrap|transsexuals]] show up at [http://www.empflix.com/view.php?id=32600 women’s rights meetings]. Afterwards most of the participants logged off MetaFilter and headed over to /b/ to fap to [[Cake|delicious lolis]], all the while [http://www.lemonparty.org congratulating] themselves for being [[Newfag|smarter than your average /b/tards.]]

== Self-Congratulation ==
MeFites are famous for [[Auto-fellatio|lauding themselves]] for pulling together as a community. [[I WOULD HAVE SEX WITH ALL THIS WHITE GIRLS|“Oh my God you guys are so amazing,”]] someone will post after a [[Permabanned|death]] results in a chain of “.” symbols, and then the mod will post it to the front page.  Everyone will be [[Dat_ass|amazed]] by themselves for honoring the dead person with a mass of astute punctuation marks, demonstrating the [[Retarded|good sense]] of being on Metafilter instead of [[4chan]]. Just recently they gave themselves a [[Masturbation|stroke]] over how they busted up a [http://metatalk.metafilter.com/19420/Update-on-K-and-S white-slavery ring]. Of course, like most of their good deeds, it exists [http://www.miconian.com/2010/05/23/metafilter-and-the-russian-sex-slaves-that-never-were/ only in their imaginations.]
