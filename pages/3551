HA! HA! Guy
[[Image:HA HA GUY.jpg|thumb|500px|center|'''HA HA''']]
This [[meme]] is so [[At least 100 years ago|ancient]] [[shit nobody cares about|that its roots are unknown]] since the [[13 year old boys|founding fathers]] of this [[old meme|historic meme]] have long ago left the Internets due to losing their virginity and/or getting a life.

Howevar, [[nice try|scientists of the speculative arts]] have posited that it dates back to 1773 when an [[terrorists|angry mob of colonists]] helped spark the [[9/11|American Revolution]] by dumping their [[British]] massas' tea supply into Boston Habah. 

The [[IRL troll|epic troll]] became known as [[ATHF Terrorist Attack|Boston Tea Party]] and when asked to comment on it, ringleader John [[Masturbation|Hancock]] (who later invented the signature) said: '''"HA! HA!"'''

==LOL, SRSLY Though==

[[image:OriginalHaHa.jpg|thumb|right|HA! HA! I'm advertising... wait, what?]]

This is the real origin of Ha Ha guy. It is generally thought to be from some time between 1850 and 1900. It advertises Forbes Dry Photographic Plates, and you can see a reverse watermark from the scanner saying "Photographic" backwards across his face.

The "[[Internets]]" version first appeared on [[SA]] in January 1953 from whence it spread to [[Fark]] like a fucking [[Zerg Rush]]. In a desperate attempt to stop the flood, on the weekend of the 15th of July (a weekend renowned in the annals of mediocrity as "The Grey Wave") the mods encouraged posters to post HA! HA! in every thread they could in the hope of wearing the meme out.

"[[Suicide|Backfired]]" has never been so well defined (to say nothing of overestimating the intelligence of your userbase).

HA! HA! Is also lulzworthy for creating a GIGANTIC shitstorm of drama between internet detectives vehemently debating its real origin. The question of whether [[Shit nobody cares about|Forbes Plates]] were dental plates or photographic plates was apparently such [[serious business]] that different camps - naming themselfs "HaHa-ists" - defined themselves as either Dental HaHa-ists or Photographic HaHa-ists.

[[Some argue]] that this pyrotechnically pathetic spectacle had more lulz per square thread than the meme itself, especially given that one can solve the whole matter in about two minutes by actually picking up a real fucking book rather than relying on fevered combing of [[TOW]] and [[Snopes]] for all your knowledge of the world (you fucking dork).
