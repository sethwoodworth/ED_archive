ITT
[[Image:Suicide girl asking for it.jpg|thumb|ITT we post [[Cracky-chan|jailbait]].  Plz.]]
'''ITT''' means "in this thread."  It is similar to discuss in its simplicity and common usage by lazy, unoriginal [[fucktard]]s. It is common [[newfag]] practice to start threads asking what this phrase means.

It is often used as a cheap ploy to gather [[furry]] [[shit|scat]] [[porn]] and Harry Potter [[slashfic]] without having to do any [[internet stalking|research]] at all.

ITT has also been bastardized to mean "It's Tool Time," usually to mean "Break out your [[Photoshop|Photoshoop]]" on a particular image.
