'''I heard it on the Internet''' is a phrase used to affirm the credibility of one's sources. Reputable internet sources include [[IRC]] channels, [http://www.angelfire.com/oh/ilovesaxophones/ Angelfire] websites with animated gifs, and [http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/10/18/football.threats/index.html?section=cnn_topstories 4chan].

Use it in everyday speech and intellectual or philosophical discussion. Your opponents will be stunned by the immediate truth of your claim. Information derived from an internet is a a form of divine inspiration, and if anyone still disagrees with you, [[witch|burn them]].

"I heard it on the internet" stopped working on anyone but gullible twelve-year-olds right after the dot com bust. The words have been known to reduce historians and journalists to sobbing children. It can still be used as a cop-out when you realize you're completely wrong in the middle of a conversation. The phrase was first used by Jesus Christ. 

John 1:50 
  Jesus answered him, "Because I told you,'I saw you browsing 4chan,' do you believe? 
  You will see greater things than these! I heard it on the Internet."

On October 18th 2006, a bomb threat, then thought to be [[serious business|serious]], was reported by the FBI. They claimed hundreds of thousands would die when multiple football stadiums across the country would be hit simultaneously by radiological "dirty" bombs, and that they had heard it on the Internet. Luckily for the world, it turned out to be [[4chan]] [[copypasta]]. The /b/tard responsible was subsequently arrested, and sentenced to be [[rape|raeped]].

The validity of Internet-derived information rests on the general consensus that the Internet is [[Serious Business]]. [[Some argue|There are those which hold that]] the Internet is a disreputable or unreliable source of information due to the lack of sources or the writer's anonymity, but those people are '''[[stupid]] [[Nazi]] [[Fag|faggot-ass]] [[pedophiles]] and members of the [[KKK|Ku Klux Klan]].'''
