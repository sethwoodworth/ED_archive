Pop'n Music
{{crap}}

[[Image:Popnlogo.png|thumb‎]] (スーパペドマシーヌ) is the most dangerous video game ever created. The object of the game is to mash colored buttons until your hands bleed while watching [[furry]] cartoon characters dance, in order to play Japanese pop songs about sushi, anime, video games, and various other things no one who isn't [[wapanese]] would give a fuck about.

==History==

[[Image:mimiandnyami.png|thumb|If you were a ''Pop'n Music'' player looking at this picture, you would be ejaculating onto your monitor by now.]]

''Pop'n Music'' was originally conceived as a secret project of the Japanese government to destroy western society. Their hope was to create a game which would turn anyone who played it into a [[gay]], [[furry]], [[pedophile]], or ''gafupedo'' (ガフペド), with superhuman reflexes. Reflexes that would allow them to overthrow their respective governments, and force anyone who refused to join them to watch gay furry porn until they went insane. However, like all Japanese plans for world domination, their idea backfired as they forgot to tell anyone outside of Japan the game existed. Additionally, over 20 versions of the game had already been released by the time they realized their mistake, and it had become quite popular in their homeland. Consequently, Japan now has the largest population of gafupedo on the planet.

==Outside of Japan==

Even among the most hardcore [[japanophiles]], relatively few know of ''Pop'n Music'''s existence. Many argue that this is for the best, as people have been turned into gafupedo just by hearing a vague description of what playing ''Pop'n Music'' is like. If you know anyone who plays ''Pop'n Music'', do not hesitate to kill them and burn their corpse, along with any copies of the game you can find. There is no cure for being a gafupedo, and even a second wasted with indecision may cost you your only chance to avoid being turned into one.

The following games bear some superficial similarities to ''Pop'n Music'', however none of them have the power to transform people into a gafupedo. There's still a pretty strong case for staying the hell away from them though.

*''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''
*''Beatmania''
*''[[Guitar Hero]]'' if you are too fat to actually move.
