'''[http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/ Fbr_trash]''' ([[Weeaboo|Fueled By Ramen]], a label dedicated entirely to signing Fall Out Boy and [[Paramore]] type bands) is a community on [[LiveJournal]] full of [[preteen]] [[fangirls]] who think they're the [[shit]] for pretending to [[hate]] shitty [[emo]] bands like [[Faggotry|Panic At The Disco]] when they actually [[fap]] to them every day. It gets deleted by one of the moderators every few hours either due to mood swings resulting from menstruation or [[lulz]] not meeting their expectations.

[[Image:BeatDeadHorse.gif|thumb|Describes this community perfectly.|right]] [[Image:Beating-a-dead-horse.gif|thumb|See above caption.|right]] [[Image:vennfbr.jpg|thumb|Pretty. Accurate.|right]]Most of the people here use '~*' to a highly ~*irritating ~*degree, and pretend that they know [[meme]]s, while really not saying any past variations of so I herd u liek [[mudkip]]. There are [[over 9000|way too many]] pages of spam posted to this community every day, 1% of which is <i>actually</i> whining about Fueled By Ramen bands.

Fbr_trash (commonly referred to as <i>fbrt</i>) was started by the most [[retarded|rabid]] of fangirls [[at least 100]] years ago. Membership is closed at the moment. [http://community.livejournal.com/patd Go cry somewhere else.]



==History==

Even though the present posts suck walls of dicks now, it was once a qualified [[lulz]] worthy community. [[Over nine thousand]] years ago its first deletion was made. The mods' mood swings kicked in once they decided the community no longer had the [[lulz]] it used to. The flock of [[preteens]] BAAAWWW'd and made a new, [[more]] shittier spin off version of the community known as oicfbr. Oicfbr was full of unfunny jokes, bitterness, and clique members. Once the community came back from the month long [[brb]] the delusional [[preteens]] nearly creamed themselves and flew to their mother community to celebrate, and shat up the entire community in the process. Now the community is considered permashit, besides the occasional [[lulz]] worthy post.

==The Pete Head==

[[Image:Fugpetewentzut4.jpg|frame|The infamous Pete Head.]]

Due to the inflow of shitty posts in the beginning of the reign of Fbr_trash, moderator, [http://prostitution.livejournal.com/ prostitution], decided that a form of punishment was needed in order to keep the posts in check. She came up with the brilliant and [[epic]] idea to [[spam]] each post doused in shit with a page-stretching picture showcasing Pete Wentz's [[fag|fug]] as hell face and horse teeth.

Not only did this keep the posts and members alert, but it also minimized the amount of [[shit nobody cares about|OT]] posts.

The <i>Pete Head System</i> is still currently being used within the community.

==The Cycle==
Fbrt goes through the same process that repeats itself every few months; it goes as follows. 

* Something hilarious/scandalous happens within FBR
* All the noobs start joining because they want to know the ~details on said event.
* Fbrt milks the scandal/hilarity for as long as it possible can. 
* People start complaining that the event is old news and everyone needs to stop posting about it. 
* No more hilarity is happening so people start posting memes and unrelated things.
* The noobs go 'oic' and they contribute to the memes. 
* The mods go 'omg fbrt wut is wrong with u'!!!
* The comm gets deleted for a month because that will ~totes make it more awesome when it returns.
* The comm returns, cycle begins again.

==Members==

The members of fbrt can be subdivided into many different categories as follows.

===Mods===
The mods are all [[Nazis]] who will [[permaban]] you for lulz (or actual helpful posts, such as the case of [http://www.livejournal.com/~robotbear]). In reality, they are all lazy and get asslickers to do everything for them. It is assumed that either there is no posting queue, meaning nobody checks the posts, and [[delete fucking everything|fucking everything]] gets posted automatically, or that the mods don't actually give a [[shit]] about keeping the journal on topic.

*Current mods:

*[http://www.livejournal.com/~saturnus saturnus] Previously [http://www.livejournal.com/~marciletsdisco marciletsdisco] Also referred to as "Marci" or "Macri". Alleged fangirl who secretly brags about not listening to FBR bands despite her frequent lurking of the [[faggotry|Panic at the Disco]] Livejournal community. Is friends with other mods, so was given moderation privilege due to association. Pushover.
*[http://lurid_eye.livejournal.com lurid_eye] Just ended a long term relationship with William Beckett, due to his recent bitchassness. Has rebounded with Gabe Saporta and is now waiting for the invite into his basement. Certain reports state she is actually Alex Marshall, due to her 'lurid eye,' others know Alex Marshall is most likely a bitter anon. Token Mexican. She owns numerous sombreros and ponchos and has a taco factory in her kitchen which will be perfect for when Molex comes over.
*[http://loln.livejournal.com/ loln] Australian. No one knows where she came from but she's here. Is indie.
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~prostitution prostitution] Previously peetwents, also referred to as "Molly". [[Batshit_insane|Batshit insane]] and an [[elite]] powertripper. Only mod that actually [[b7]]s people that need to gtfo. Most proficient mod that actually lays the smack down when OT comments become abundant. Nobody knows what she is doing rn since she got remodded after lurid's useless takeover a couple of months ago.
*[http://microwatts.livejournal.com microwatts] Is one of the two new mods. Constantly forgets her midol resulting in massive, raging PMS like bitchy behavior. Is a valley-forge girl.
*[http://taffys.livejournal.com taffys] New mod and previous clique member. Sweet hot bitch. Would date Tanner if his dick was big enough to reach her in Australia.


Not so current mods:
*[http://ohnoezlolhan.livejournal.com ohnoezlolhan] Died.
*[http://stfxup_lauren.livejournal.com stfxup_lauren] Known as laur laur or lolo. No one really knows where she came from originally, but everyone worships her. Probably because she's a [[whore|hot]] alcoholic. Dropped her ass up outta college much like Kanye West and Ryan Ross but wants everyone to know that she's in college now (lol okay jac vanek). Major bitch who likes to complain about old memes like her involvement with The Cab and how Alex Deleon scribbled on her macarena or something. Dicks around with groupie sluts all day. Huge bitch. Pretty much runs shit but has no qualms about being a complete and utter dick to anyone who bothers her even a little. Favorite activities include drinking, chainsmoking and taunting fat preteens from backstage.
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~obeytheempress obeytheempress] Also referred to as "Tara". Brags about performing sexual favors for her [[azn]] boyfriend. Also original moderator, creator of community. Much like a flareup of genital herpes; she comes around every once and a while just to be annoying, everyone pays attention to her, and then she goes away again for a long period of time....but you can never completely get rid of her.
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~homophobia homophobia] Also referred to as "Nat". Most [[indie]] of the five moderators. Admired by other supposed indie Fbr_trash members such as [http://www.livejournal.com/~old_fart_1 old_fart_1] and [http://www.livejournal.com/~ftaires ftaires]. Is friends with [http://www.livejournal.com/~prostitution prostitution], and was alleged first member, so was given moderation privilege. Doesn't really do anything anymore. Was demodded and replaced with Lauren which basically ensures dramallama until the end of days.
*[http://kevinpowerspace.livejournal.com/profile kevinpowerspace] Kevin Kane from the band Powerspace. Was given moderation privileges by [http://www.livejournal.com/~prostitution prostitution] and [http://www.livejournal.com/~marciletsdisco marciletsdisco] as a joke. A negotiable amount of d's were being s'd and, to this day, he still remains a moderator. CEPT THAT HE DELETED. SO N.

===The Clique===
[[Image:Macrossitdownix7.png|frame|Self-explanatory.]]
The Clique is a group of very close "friends" who may or may not be [[lesbians]] plotting a giant orgy in the near future. Most moderators and members of Fbr_trash blame them for all the problems within the community. This includes: lack of [[lulz]], obnoxious new members, lame posts, shitty manips, and the apocalypse.

They are hated on mostly for invading Fbr_trash posts with their shitty inside jokes, one of which includes a [[shit nobody cares about|panda]]. They also make shitty posts asking members to join their aim and/or [[stickam]] chats, however once someone enters said chat, that person is ignored, denounced, belittled, and/or disregarded to the fullest extent. The clique may think the chats are funny, but [[irl|in reality]] they're [[not funny|not]], don't bother.

The Clique is kind of dead now, most likely plotting a civil war.

The Clique consists of (give or take a few members):
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~turnthisaround turnthisaround] Also known as Jess. Would suck [[pussy|Nate Novarro]]'s dick if given the chance and loves Tom Conrad just a little [[creepy|too much]]. One of the few original members left who call people out for being [[retarded]], which makes her hated by [[n00bs]].  Is not as bad anymore, but is still a raging bitch every once and a while. Is dead.
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~organs organs] Ximeng or ~Sha-mung~ Recently kicked the fuck out of the clique because of overall bitchassness. Is dead.
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~sup sup] formerly known as [http://www.livejournal.com/~mayfair mayfair] and [http://www.livejournal.com/~mayfair taffys] Aka kate/k8/k*/k7/ksomeothernumbersandsymbols. Token Australian. Is extremely qt and is a mega bitch. Is related to Dan Young and Michael Guy Chislett. Is married to Tanner which rises anger out of many desperate girls such as soup_opera and Darian. Is involved in a world war sparked by Darian who wants to fuck Tanner up the butt. We are yet to see what's going to go down. She is also a sexy bitch. Momo tree. 
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~awkwardlovin awkwardlovin] Token asian. Better than Ximeng. Needs to GTFO. Loved by retarded clique members. Is obsessed with shitty boy bands. Is the creator of the worst memes in the world. Will shove a grenade up your dickhole if pissed. Shady fucking character. Is too nice to n00bs.
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~ftaires ftaires] It's official, he's gone to the dark side. He is widely accepted by all members and suspected to be engaged in a possible romance with [http://www.livejournal.com/~sup sup], granting immediate acceptance into The Clique, as per citizenship-by-marriage. However, speculations points out that she probably hates him nowadays. Still living unless he has OD'd or Spoken Woods has been signed.
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~tsoaf tsoaf] Usually the starter of the fail filled aim chats that take place. Also sucks [[bitch|jess's]] dick very frequently.
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~volbeats volbeats] Def. the noobiest of the clique. 14 years old, also known as Jane. Predicted to be the next one kicked the fuck out of the clique also because of her disgusting obssesion with the [[fags|jobros]]. Also got b7ed recently for going batshit OT in a ~help save our fbrt movement~ post even when anons and mods warned her. Will remain the noobiest for fucking ever. Is dead.
*[http://www.livejournal.com/~alanbosley alanbosley] Ali, aka terrorist, aka dyke, aka Ali the terrorist dyke. Was exploited by Zak Broman who told the world Ali's deep dark secret, that she is the one responsible for 9/11. Finds it amusing to stalk any and every band member that crosses her lesbionic path. Ali Carcache and Regina George were seen canoodling at Chris Isen's halloween party. Zak Broman also masturbated on stickam (but failed). Douche.

The Clique are known to be Soviet spies who will report any shittalk. So watch yo mouf nigga.

==Noted Regs==
This is all [[fact|tru fax]].

'''Males'''
None of the fbr_t d00ds post anymore, making the site a complete vagfest.

*[http://www.livejournal.com/~rickrosstheboss rickrosstheboss] Previously [http://ftaires.livejournal.com ftaires] Possibly the only male in the community to ever post a full head shot, making him [[fap]]ping material for all the [[sif|regular]] [[16-year-old girls|members]]. Self-proclaimed [[indie]] [[douche|kid]], and Conor Oberst [[fangirl]]. Has a sexual bond with cats and when he finally [[never going to happen|loses his virginity]] the cat will have to put his dick in the right hole because he won't be able to figure it out. Refuses to date black girls. Is soulmates with [http://cucumbers.livejournal.com cucumbers] because of their indie fuck love conversations. Threw his shit on the neighbors roof that one time.
*[http://livejournal.com/~lustbug lustbug] Previously [http://fugslut.livejournal.com fugslut] Is rumored to be a girl. Sonny Moore fangirl/boy. Gets his dick sucked by everyone in the comm.
*[http://youth_hasfled.livejournal.com youth_hasfled] One of the newer males. Is black and Canadian. Is most likely a homosexual. When he's not replying with simply lol is pretty funny which makes the comm suq his big blaq diq. 
*[http://radio_collides.livejournal.com radio_collides] Is pretty irrelevant and posts once in a while but has a dick so.

'''Females'''

*[http://cucumbers.livejournal.com/ cucumbers] Constantly in competition with Tanner to see who is the bigger [[tool|hipster]]. A total indie fuck that is always complaining about everything. Thinks everyone likes her but they really all find her annoying. She should probably just leave.
*[http://amor_perfecto.livejournal.com/ amor_perfecto] Has been here forever. Loves TAI... with a passion. Has a ginger afro. Nothing else need be said.
*[http://amandaglynn.livejournal.com/ amandaglynn] probably sane.
*[http://splinches.livejournal.com splinches] Previously [http://barakat_obama.livejournal.com barakat_obama]. Thinks she is the shit because she hosted an anon_post while fbr_t was on a break. Knows that guy from Skins and Slumdog Millionaire, wants his dick. Sexy.
*[http://truffulaseeds.livejournal.com truffulaseeds] NO ONE CAN FUCKING PRONOUNCE HER USERNAME. Original person with the Emma Watson icons. Has recently becoming widowed through the tragic loss of our very own [http://ohnoezlolhan.livejournal.com ohnoezlolhan] (R.I.P). Is still in mourning but manages to stay strong and continues to post a constant spew of retarded comments for the sake of the [[anons|children]]
*[http://methodoflove.livejournal.com methodoflove] Has basically come to the comm to take the title away from [http://stfxup_lauren.livejournal.com stfxup_lauren] as Lauren, the comm slut. Has a tendency to not make any fucking sense but the collective fbrt pretty much accepts it because she has a nice rack and that's all that really matters at the end of the day. Rumored to be the sleazy and slightly retarded clone of [http://truffulaseeds.livejournal.com truffulaseeds] that was dropped into a pool as a child, and, let's be honest, she was down there for a while. Likes to keep anime pictures of herself in her binder.
*[http://wishwishwish.livejournal.com wishwishwish] Began the Matthew Gray Gubler craze. Thanks a lot bitch. Known by her dreamcatcher icon. No one knows or understands why her un is 'wish' three times. Has a boyfriend, as she loves to remind the bitter, menstruating masses. Has a double life playing drums for that band on Fearless.
*[http://timider.livejournal.com timider] FBRT's IRL Indian with a homophobic/racist father. Can be funny at times, but is usually irrelevant. Smells good. Loves Adam Lambert with a passion.
*[http://iamgringa.livejournal.com iamgringa] Tends to be slutty, but is remembered for trolling That One Time. Knows perverts IRL. Paid for FBRT's account one time so we could get the 'expand' button back though, so all is well. Is also unhealthy obsessive when it comes to Eminem.
*[http://to_our_savior.livejournal.com to_our_savior] Otter icon. Only has one tit and won't stfu about it, rumored she lost it when [http://buhgahs.livejournal.com buhgahs] bit it off. Is in the Itteh Bitteh Kitteh Committeh according to buhgahs.
*[http://navahomies.livejournal.com navahomies] Previously [http://neelyohara.livejournal.com neelyohara]. Still called neely. Indie slut who constantly makes Alex Greenwald posts despite the pleading and begging of all other members. Is in cohorts with other indie sluts [http://cucumbers.livejournal.com/ cucumbers] and [http://acquirings.livejournal.com acquirings] to turn the comm into OT [[shit]].
*[http://5foot4.livejournal.com/ 5foot4] Previously [http://rynarawss.livejournal.com rynarawss]. Sweet princess who stans for MCR.

===Anons===

The anons of fbrt, also known wholly as "Bitter/Angry/Rude Anon", are known for being extremely [[butthurt|hostile]] in almost every post. They attack members of the community  at random for being [[fat]] and jealous. They are one of the only sources of real [[lulz]] and are too familiar with the oh so classic lines "u r a pussy because you won't post under ur real name!!!!11!!!!", "ur opinion doesn't matter bc ur anon!!1!1!111!!!!!", and "______ anon is ______". 
Also make you piss yourself laughing. 
[http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/810849.html?thread=33514849#t33514849 Example of One Anon]
[http://ftaires.livejournal.com/34908.html?thread=230492#t230492 Example of Many Anons] [http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/812366.html?thread=33717838#t33717838 and another] [http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/810849.html?thread=33519969#t33519969 and another]
[http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/2289112.html?thread=221850072#t221850072 and another~]

Anonymity has now become somewhat of a trend on fbrt. Anons are now creating accounts named after popular fbrt members and just adding "anon" at the end. For example [http://www.livejournal.com/~barakat_anon barakat_anon]. Possibly one of the most annoying trends. It's kind of over now, though. Another trend was weirdly sexual fanfictions about various members. Recently they began creating accounts with an Fbrt member's username backwards and flipping their icons. It wasn't neither funny nor clever.

===n00bz===

*[http://ffancykid.livejournal.com ffancykid]  Annoying fangirl of all sorts. Posts useless articles and crap no one truly cares about. Can be a rude bitch to anyone who challenges her, making it fun for anons to bait her into fights. Met Snoop Dogg, probably the only person you will ever find who is obsessed with snoop and panic at the disco, together. faggot
*[http://jbftw.livejournal.com/ jbftw] Noted [[pedo_bear|Gabe Saporta]] fangirl. Has admited to lurking outside his apartment, so is obviously a creep who should gtfo of life. Constantly asks people when they got through to the cobra phone because she can't seem to comprehend that Gabe does not want to talk to an obsessive twat like herself. should probably give up on life and cobra starship because neither of them seem to be working for her.
*[http://x-unitydivides.livejournal.com/ x-unitydivides] Loves the Jonas Brothers. Is most likely the origin of all the Jonas Brothers fan fiction on the internet. Would have a foursome with the Jonas Brothers. everybody says shes so sweet but shes really a big bitch. and if it came down to having sex with the jonas brothers she probably wouldnt do it in fear of offending her lord.
*[http://fghtffyrdmnss.livejournal.com/ fghtffyrdmnss] writes panic at the disco slash. examples include, but are not limited to: ''He felt Ryan's, oh god he is way too huge to be doing this cock pushing through the tight ring of Brendon's entrance.''
*[http://hopelessheartz.livejournal.com/ hopelessheartz] Most likely an annoying as fuck [[sif]] who lives in a purple hoodie. She is noted for trying way too hard and constantly calling the cobra starship phone making it impossible for anyone else to get through. No one likes her. Tries to make sure that Gabe her bitch, or vise versa. Fails at it. She basically needs to stfu and/or gtfo but both would be preferable. Obsessed with [[pedo_bear|Gabe Saporta]] and faps to him every night. Isn't banned anymore. Is in a feud with [http://livejournal.com/~lalalalalavish lalalalalavish].
*[http://daviiestarship.livejournal.com/ daviiestarship] Definition of a tool. Claims he slept with Chris Donathon of the Medic Droid when he was 13. Was beat up by girls. Lies about his age. Known for over exaggerated use of "D:" ":|" and ":(". Needs to take a hint and GTFO IMMEDIATELY. Emo/scene. Constantly complains about his sister and is friends with tvanon (???). Does not "WANT TO BE IN THE FUCKING ED." Too late bitch, you're added. Hasn't posted as frequently as he used to, only to fight off anons and bitch about The Academy Is..., Probably finally got a fucking clue.
*[http://hristv.livejournal.com/ hristv] Alcoholic who got Kevin Kane's name tattooed on her tit [http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/2247061.html#cutid1]. Would be considered a Reg, but her ultimate ink fail will forever regail her to the rank of n00b.
*[http://aquarelrivers.livejournal.com/ aquarelrivers] A wannabe. Tries way too hard to ensue lols. Thinks she is part of an elitist group on the web. Pretends to be indie. Sucks dicks of everyone above her. Most recent noob idiot.
*[http://ranges.livejournal.com/ ranges] Openly stans Pete Wentz. No one really knows what to think of her. Showed up during the 2nd olympix as [http://superanonn.livejournal.com/ superanonn], but renamed shortly after they ended. Will bite your dick off if you post male models in her posts.
*[http://oceantea.livejournal.com oceantea] Used to be [http://chokes.livejournal.com/ chokes] the annoying All Time Low fan b7 in the olden days where the comm was rid of obnoxious sluts. Has the most fragile anus known to mankind, any and everything causes her to become insanely butthurt and converts that butthurt into bitchiness. Can be butthurt for weeks maybe even months so don't fuck with her. But some stupid fucks instigate so it's not entirely her fault.
*[http://caselyn.livejournal.com caselyn] Dumb as fuck Fayley who needs to leave. Since when does she stan MCR?

==Famous Lurkers and/or Members==

There are several Fbr members that have been seen lurking and/or posting in Fbr_trash.	 
Below are the members that have been confirmed:	 
*<b>David Blaise</b> of the band This Providence	 
**Frequents the Fbrtrash AIM chat, has taken a (notably bitter) fansign	 
*<b>Andy Horst </b> of the band This Providence	 
**Frequents the Fbrtrash AIM chat, has admitted to lurking the neighboring community [http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_secrets fbr_secrets]	 
*<b>Vicky T</b> of the band Cobra Starship	 
**Posted and deleted a video on [[YouTube]] discussing the supposed hatred and shittalking within the Fbrt community, made and deleted an epic comment in the post that posted said video, created a blog acknowledging the backfire from both the video and comment	 
*<b>Gabe Saporta</b> of the band Cobra Starship	 
**Fellow band member, Vicky T, told members of Fbrt that Gabe had replied anonymously to a secrets post the community [http://community.livejournal.com/cobra_secrets cobrasecrets], believed to lurk Fbrt every now and then. Made a shirt stating "FBRT FTW LMYV", short for "Fbr_trash for the win, lick my vag"
*<b>Alex Suarez</b> of the band Cobra Starship
**Entered an Fbrtrash AIM chat and admitted that him and fellow band member, Gabe Saporta, lurked and that they "cracked the      up." Is now mad at FBR_trash for upsetting his mother with the Gabe Is Dead scandal.
*<b>Kevin Kane</b> of the band Powerspace	 
**Frequent Fbrt poster and commenter, acknowledged his presence in a comment, has taken a (notably witty) fansign. Is now a moderator.
*'''Alex DeLeon''' of the band The Cab
**Doesn't post or chat, but is known to lurk hardcore. He admitted to [http://stfxup_lauren.livejournal.com/ stfxup_lauren] in person that he often lurked the site out of boredom and could quote back comments that she had made on the site. (This is a sign of his obsession with the mod, although some believe that Lauren is actually the one obsessed.) Claims to find it hilarious - but this is highly doubted.
*'''Alex Marshall''' of the band The Cab
**The whole of The Cab are mega-butthurt over fbr_t, and do their best to ~warn and inform all other fbr bands about the community, the most recent example being The Hush Sound, leading to an equally butthurt interview where Greta and Dan both insist they've never read the community, but seem to know a fair bit about it. Dirty hippies. [http://sweettangerine.net/test.php?subaction=showfull&id=1219623244&archive=&start_from=&ucat=&]
*<b>Pete Wentz</b> of the band nobody's heard of
**Listed FBR_T in his top 9 for 2009 saying "because i love the haters. there is something in me that gets that. i like it if its witty, if its faster than me. if you burn me. i dish it alot, i deserve to take it some too. (which member do you think i am? i like you. you are the wild west." [http://petewentz.com/post/68073784/top-9-for-the-start-of-2009]

==The Birth of Effie B. Artie==

Effie B. Artie was grew up visiting several small comms. She was fond of the ever popular [http://www.livejournal.com/~viawentztop viawentztop] as well as the more general community of [http://www.livejournal.com/~anonquestions anonquestions]. When she came across Fbr_trash, she was flooded with inspiration, and began writing every fleeting thought she had down on paper. This became her artwork, her masterpieces. 

Artie released her first single "Bad Romance" shortly after her first visit to the fueled by ramen inspired livejournal community. Critics condemned her for her unconventional, blunt lyrics. She continues to release singles every few months, and her popularity has grown exponentially. Whoever wrote this section needs to finish it ok cool.

==Getting The Band Involved==	 
*<b>[http://community.livejournal.com/paramoremusic/1753502.html?thread=22393502 paramoremusic g8] - probably one of the community's most treasured "pwn". </b>

Unknowing [http://www.livejournal.com/~paramoremusic paramoremusic] member made a statement that the band Paramore was "bringing back rock and roll." All knowing moderator, [http://www.livejournal.com/~Obeytheempress obeytheempress] called out Unknowing [http://www.livejournal.com/~paramoremusic paramoremusic] member, spawning an epic thread of [http://www.livejournal.com/~paramoremusic paramoremusic] n00bz defending their god Hayley Williams. Somewhere in this thread, the one and only Hayley Williams replied to [http://www.livejournal.com/~obeytheempress obeytheempress], saying something along the lines of "Hey man, IAWTC! We aren't reviving rock! But don't bash my vocal chords man, I can sing FREAKING MARIAH STYLE!". Resulted in [http://www.livejournal.com/~paramoremusic paramoremusic] n00bz making comments like "WOW HAYLEY YOU OWNED HER!", when in fact, Hayley was agreeing with [http://www.livejournal.com/~obeytheempress obeytheempress]. [http://www.livejournal.com/~paramoremusic paramoremusic] is now a prime target for [http://www.livejournal.com/~fbr_trash Fbr-trash] bashing.

This was considered an [[epic]] event in Fbr_trash history due to Tara's ability to "get the band involved". You can find Hayley's response and the thread in it's entirety [http://community.livejournal.com/paramoremusic/1753502.html?thread=22393502#t22393502 here].


*<b>[http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/1629668.html?thread=60494052#t60494052 kevin from powerspace g8] - the most legendary thing that has ever happened to fbr_trash.</b>

In some post that nobody cared about, a member of the Fueled By Ramen band Powerspace left a comment using their band journal. This member was Kevin Kane and he succeeded in making the entire comunity shit bricks. Fbr_t was not only surprised by him keeping his promise and making a sign, but also his knowledge of internet speak and the amount of lulz he brought. [http://i32.tinypic.com/bc2rr.jpg Blaise-ically.]


*<b>[http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/1658274.html Vicky-T g8] Vicky - T looks like a man.</b>

Member (and noted gkarth fangirl) [http://www.livejournal.com/sseasonalaffair sseasonalaffair] made a post jokingly calling out [[tool|gkarth]] as a pedo. Post has since been [[baleeted]] due to the mods wanting to suck gkarths nine dicks.

*<b>[http://www.kierensmith.com/main/2009/04/to-all-scene-queens-and-fairweather-fans-suck-it.html Some Dude In A Sing It Loud/You Deserve To Be Slapped]-No Press Is Bad Press</b>

Sing It Loud dude [[faggot|Karen Smith]] made a post in his [http://www.kierensmith.com/main/2009/04/to-all-scene-queens-and-fairweather-fans-suck-it.html blog] calling out Fbr_Trash and a gossip site [http://fueled_bygossip.livejournal.com Fueled By Gossip]; and claiming that they deserve to be [[Pedophilia|slapped]]. He was supported by [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Australia Dan Young] from the band This Providence in his views. Proof: [http://twitter.com/thedanyoung/status/1582021411 this] and [http://twitter.com/thedanyoung/status/1582100628 this]. Undoubtedly this was only an act to get some publicity for his shitty [[Fail|band]]. And again, the worst part is his band was never well-known enough to be on Fbr_T.

The whole FBR_Trash [http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/2544351.html?page=1#comments unite] to fight this dude back and spammed memes in his blog's comments. Surprisingly, majority of these comments are funny. Some Sing It Loud [[12_year_old_girls|fangirls]] try to [http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/2544351.html?thread=391471583#t391471583 defend] their idol, but they spectacularly fail because of their lack of logic. This also would not be complete without some stupidity from Karen himself; deleting most of the negative comments he received in his blog.

This Karen dude also famously displays his inability to count properly as he claims that he has [http://twitter.com/kierensmith/status/1582533509 4000 haters] while FBR_Trash only has 1000 members. What he also does not realize is the comments on his blog are likely to be posted by the same few people. Kevin Kane from the band [[shit nobody cares about|Powerspace]] also [http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/2544351.html?thread=391630303#t391630303 responded] to this faggotry Karen was displaying. The publicity gained from Karen's actions had been bigger than any other calling-outs by other bands because FBR_Trash had really done nothing to this band for the sole reason of nobody caring enough about them. 

It has been a noted coincidence that this band collaborated with Alex Gaskarth (see above)in one of their songs  and this dude might only be following Gaskarth's footsteps. Only he's way uglier than Gkarth. And wouldn't be likely to be featured on the cover of AP anytime soon.

'''DO YOU WANT SOME SALT FOR THAT BURN, KAREN?''' 
''We think YOU'RE the idiot.''

==Drama/Historical Events==

*<b>Lolwentzfucks feud</b>: When Fbr_trash first became a community, many people over at [[Anonquestions]] (a Livejournal community on the other side of the [[internets]]) claimed that the community was too similar to the Livejournal community lolwentzfucks. Words were said, spam was given and taken, but in the end Fbr_trash "prevailed" and lolwentzfucks ended up permanently [http://livejournal.com/~lolwentzfucks butthurt].
*<b>Taking over an entire community</b>: When community [http://community.livejournal.com/we_love_fbr/ we_love_fbr] was spawned, it was brought to fbr_t's attention that something along the lines of "WE ARE THE COUNTER COMMUNITY OF FBR_TRASH. FBR_TRASH ARE SHITTY ASSHATS WITH NO LIFES LOLOL!!!!!" was set as [http://community.livejournal.com/we_love_fbr/ we_love_fbr's] user info, fbr_t attacked. One fbr_trash member schmoozed one of the [http://community.livejournal.com/we_love_fbr/ we_love_fbr] mods into making her a mod, then she demodded all of them, opened membership, and all fbr_trash members started spamming with n00dz, manips, etc. [http://community.livejournal.com/we_love_fbr/ we_love_fbr] got butthurt, and their 12 year old member [http://community.livejournal.com/sinnotatragedy sinnotatragedy] thought it would be cool to report fbr_trash for "harassment". Fbr_t went on a week long scare of getting banned by the internet police, and when they were not, all things went back to normal and they all patted themselves on the back for such an epic [[pwn]].
*<b>Oicfbr feud</b>: During the time of the lolwentzfucks feud, Fbrt worried about the community's ability to remain undeleted and active. In an attempt to salvage the community's spirit, several backup communities were created, thus the birth of oicfbr. That community began to become active despite Fbrt's victory over lwf. The feud of Fbrt vs. Oic then began. This battle continued over a long period of time, even becoming the cause of Fbrt's deletion at one point. However, Oic's shitty inside jokes, creation of [[shit nobody cares about|joobz]], and constant babbling of the word <i>doof</i> ended up being their demise.
*<b>Roxania h8 g8</b>: Fbrt member, [http://livejournal.com/~roxania roxania], was a well known oicfbr frequenter. It is said that she became so [[butthurt]] from Fbrt's actions against Oic that she ended up creating a long, yet very [[epic]], post on oicfbr letting everyone know how she "really felt". Excerpts from this post include "I'M A FUCKING CHRISTIAN BUT IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT I ENJOY <I>[[lulz|PREMARITAL SEX]]</I>" as well as rants on how she's 15 but still more wise and witty than all the members of Fbrt, et cetera. This epic event ended up being even more epic due to a dramatic reading of the post being done on [[ytmnd]]. Roxania can be seen every now and then posting [[memes]] and/or anon posts in Fbrt, but as of late it is speculated that she has [[butthurt|left the community for good]].
*<b>William Beckett's secret bb g8</b>: When some creepy fangirl posted birth records of [[women|William Beckett's]] secret baby, this side of livejournal shit themselves. Pictures were found, marriage records were found, and all fans of the band The Academy Is decided that fbr_trash was the place to get the info on their womanly God's secret child. The member count of fbr_trash nearly doubled, stupid n00bz were called out, trolls resulted, and all loyal fans of the band cried and cried because they weren't the ones to carry his first child. In September 2009 the rumors were confirmed by Beckett himself in [http://pics.livejournal.com/srchxandxdstry/pic/0006seat some issue of Alternative Press.]
[[Image:Snapshot20080105231725vq4.png|frame|A comment left from an Fbr_trash member during the Dear Mr. Urie g8.]]
*<b>Dear Mr. Urie g8</b>: Long ago, on the community [http://livejournal.com/~fueledbygossip fueledbygossip], a screencapped version of a blog that fellow [[camwhore|scene queen]] Lana Jade had ~supposedly~ written was posted. This blog was controversial in many ways. It discussed issues such as her relationship with [[shit|Panic at the Disco]] member, Brendon Urie (proven within the blog to be more than just friendly) as well as intimate details from their supposed relationship (one involving Urie, his cum, and a coffee table that was inevitably ruined). This printscreened version of the blog was later posted on Fbr_trash, causing an inflow of fangirls to comment with different variations of "oic", "lol",  and "I knew Brendon got down like that." As the pages grew more numerous in response to the post's claims, it was obvious that this had become [[serious business]]. The seriousness of this post had even been confirmed when an anonymous supposed friend of Lana had commented telling Fbrt's members to "stop", "stfd" and "to get a life". No strangers to these commands, the members of Fbrt dusted this friend hidden in anonymity off their shoulders and continued to ridicule both Lana Jade and Brendon Urie. Over time, Lana flip-flopped saying she didn't write the blog and that a friend, out of spite, had hacked her profile and written it. Fbr_trash, not fooled by such [[bullshit]], refused to believe what she had to say and kept addressing the topic at every opportune (and even inopportune) moment. It is yet to be confirmed whether or not Brendon Urie did, in fact, ruin said coffee table, but hear you me, if it's the last thing these Fbr_trashers do, it'll be to solve this mystery. 
*<b>Convoitises h8 g8</b>: During the creation of this Encyclopedia Dramatica page, [[o rly|bitter anons]] continued to edit in a section dedicated to Fbrt Clique member convoitises (see also: The Clique). The section included condescending details of her [[irl]] life and values as well as being pwned, pwning other members, and being held in contempt. The Convoitises section inevitably grew longer than the ED sections for both Mods and The Clique combined. It eventually became a battle versus anons and users to see who could either <i>edit and delete</i> or <i>edit and add back</i> the section. After reading the selection, Ximeng grew worried of the people within the community and their obsession with seeing her [[fail|go down in flames]] and/or becoming butthurt. In the end, it was concluded through a second party [[butthurt|flounce]] that she was no longer a part of the community. Former mod Alyssa made a post with an Eric Prydz song on autoplay that stated "ROXANIA AND CONVOITISES HAVE LEFT THE BUILDING." This resulted in her losing her mod position, and many angry anons telling her that no one gave a fuck, and really, no one did.
*<b>Ryan/Keltie love g8</b>: Moderator [http://livejournal.com/~marciletsdisco marciletsdisco] made a post claiming that she had received a stern instant message from a concerned lurker of Fbrt asking them to discontinue discussions of Ryan Ross (guitarist of Panic at the Disco) and his girlfriend, Keltie Colleen. Though the full content of the instant message was never revealed, she posted an excerpt from said message in which the concerned lurker stated that they did not want their screenname being leaked. The post she made addressing this message stated that Ryan and Keltie would "appreciate it", implying that they do, in fact, lurk Fbrt from time to time. Several minutes after Marci had made the announcement, another user, more than likely a hilarious [[troll]], made a post spamming with Ryan/Keltie pics that said "hey let's discuss ryan and keltie." It is also speculated that Fbrt member [http://livejournal.com/~mormonisms mormonisms] also received a similar instant message from the same screenname, more than likely being confused as a mod by the concerned lurker. This information, however, has yet to be confirmed.
*<b>Shaant dix g8</b>: Shaant pm came out in a personal bulletin and then took it back (baleeted it) because he realized that Fbrt had screencapped that shit.
*<b>March 21st</b>: An epic day of [[spam]].

*<b>America H8 G8</b>: An anon went on ranting on how american's deserve shit and thank god for 9/11. Pure bullshit.

*<b>SAVE TEH SCENE</B>: Two wannabe scene queens posted a video on YouTube and mentioned how fbr_trash was part of destroying the scene and how the trashing was so out of line. <embers lol'd and it wasn't long before the wannabe sqs posted anonymously about how everyone was insensitive and shit.

*<b>Gabe is dead</b>: A picture of [[Pedophilia|Gabe Saporta's]] death certificate was posted along with a screencap of MTV news saying that the band had been in a car accident and Gabe had died on the scene. Even though it was obivously fake, many [[sif|fangirls]] proceded to [[an hero|cry]]. Realising that it was indeed fake, said fangirls hid away in [[fail|shame]]. Later it was reveled via AIM with Alex Suarez that his mother had found the fake MTV news screencap and also was [[BAW|upset]]. Many [[fail|members]] were banned and people [[fail|begged]] for him to love FBR_T back. 
*<b>FBR_T's Bday</b> (and Mr. Kevin Kanes - Coincidence? I THINK NOT!) 1 whole year! 1 whole year! - Lulz were had with mega spam and the release of apparent Shaant n00dz. And when Gabe Is Dead (see above) got too far out of hand.

*<b>Everyone gets banned</b>: The mods along with their nazi followers including [http://livejournal.com/~meteorics meteorics], [http://livejournal.com/~accentuations accentuations], [http://livejournal.com/~crotches crotches], [http://livejournal.com/~howtosavealiz howtosavealiz], [http://livejournal.com/~stfxup_lauren stfxup_lauren] and [http://livejournal.com/~lurid_eye lurid_eye] banned over 1000 members in 8 hours from fbrt. Noobs and slash readers/writers alike wept onto their keyboard because they were ban_set. An epic day overall.
*<b>Molex + Demi = OTP</b>: First started as a [[Fail|rumor]] posted in [http://livejournal.com/~fueled_bygossip fueled_bygossip], but was then confirmed true that [[Retarded|Alex Deleon]] is in fact, dating [[Slut|Demi Lovato]] leads everyone to either A.) Be extremely creeped out or B.) Posting [[Pedobear|Pedo bear]] gifs and macros.
*<b>fbr_lust</b>: The anti-fbr_trash community [http://livejournal.com/~fbr_lust fbr_lust] was discovered, leading to fbr_t members [http://livejournal.com/~loln loln], [http://livejournal.com/~lizlilah lizlilah], [http://livejournal.com/~ftaires ftaires], and an anon (later to become [http://livejournal.com/~atacarnival atacarnival]) devising a plan to get atcarnival modded to fbr_lust. atacarnival convinced the n00b mod of fbr_lust, [http://livejournal.com/~cheaplocket cheaplocket] to mod her, and ftaires was modded in a bet. cheaplocket was de-modded, and in turn, loln, lizlilah, and [[Pedophile|Bill Nye the Science Guy]] were modded, and an epic night of spam ensued on fbr_lust, only for most of the regs & the mods to wake up the next day confused and/or rotfling at the latest fbrt conquest. \o/
*<b>Soup_Opera h8 g8</b>: Nooby slash writer [http://livejournal.com/~soup_opera soup_opera] confessed in a tmi post that she was in love with [http://livejournal.com/~ftaires ftaires].

Lurking ensued and [[dumb ass|soup_opera's]] slash, including stories about [[hipster|ftaires]], were posted on fbr_t for the world to see. Lulz were had, butts were hurt, but in the end [[sif|the clique]] ruined the internet life of another innocent noob. noobs
*<b>Creepypasta</b>: Member [http://livejournal.com/~turnthisaround turnthisaround] made a post where everyone had to post Creepypasta. This post was probably the most epic FBRT has seen in ages. Members and anons bonded while shitting brix at the same time. The celebration/rebellion lasted all the way till morning. Then in the afternoon, members and anons noticed the Creepypasta post was deleted. Everyone was outraged, but mostly anons. Butthurt comments were posted, gauntlets were thrown, the community's overall status was critiqued, and the big question "WHO DELETED IT?" was never solved. This act of backlash resulted in FBRT being deleted once again, long over due though.
*<b>Fbrt Lovefest</b>: When the [http://community.livejournal.com/fbr_trash/2398412.html 2009 FBR Predictions Post] went off topic, people began going to the [http://www.smalltime.com/anon.html Anonymous Message Server] and posting their deep, dark, and sometimes dirty secrets. Often, this would end up with someone back at the predictions post replying to the anonymous messages with words of encouragement, love, hope, or support. Eventually, this spreading of love made its way into the message server, and the usually catty fbrt turned into one big, loveable, ball of fluff where everyone was accepted and no one was turned away. Members (and non-members) [http://livejournal.com/~ymously ymously], [http://livejournal.com/~onlust onlust] [http://livejournal.com/~mystickromance mystickromance], [http://livejournal.com/~steatopygia steatopygia], [http://livejournal.com/~suq9dix_anon suq9dix_anon], [http://livejournal.com/~ohaithare ohaithare], [http://livejournal.com/~lavintage lavintage], [http://livejournal.com/~tightenedribbon tightenedribbon], [http://livejournal.com/~rachelrainna rachelrainna], [http://livejournal.com/~nabii nabii], [http://livejournal.com/~lurid_eye lurid_eye], [[http://livejournal.com/~windstreaked windstreaked], a ton of anons, and SO many more people spread the luv~*~* just in time for the new year.

During a typical TMI Thursday,  member [http://livejournal.com/~birdcaged birdcaged] mentioned that of a internet phenomenon called [[Drugs|"I-Doser"]], which thus lead to her [[dealer|to give out]] all the possible download links to share with the other members. Soon after everyone in the post went i-doser crazy. Everything from peyote to weed was tried that night.

All of the mods are b7. Then Tanner tried to get modded, but failed like he always does. In a last.fm chart post, the mod who took over posted clandan's chart and everyone began to shit brix.

==Posts==
[[Image:Macrosovercastkidsnx2.jpg|frame|100% of Fbr_trash members are classified as Overcast Kids regardless of their affiliation with Fall Out Boy.]]
The posting style is where you really see how hypocritical these [[lusers]] are. Posts about hating bands are full of people pretending to agree. Posts about liking a band get the [[OP]] [[LOL]]'d at for admitting to like what they're supposed to be ~*trashing. [[Memes]] get by far the most replies, as the lurkers come out, get abused for posting and end up [[butthurt]].

As aforementioned, about one percent of this community's posts are actually complaints about Fueled By Ramen Bands (i.e, a show was canceled, their new album is [[shit]], et cetera), and the rest of it is talking about [[fanfic|slash fiction]], how [[emo|bad their day was]], and just plain [[spam]].



'''Last.FM posts''' are made every Sunday. The post allows members to flaunt their [[last.fm]] charts for the rest of the [[internets]] to see. You will notice the majority of charts consist of FBR band [[faggotry]], [[Hardcore]] [[crap]], rock-pop [[fail]] and [[Indie]] as fuq [[shit]].

===Anon Posts===
Anon posts are posts made when Fbr_trash becomes dead and desperate. They fall under the categories such as "TMI" and "post your deep dark secrets". Some users, however, feel that they are too high and mighty to go under anon, so they continue to post under their username. Unfortunately for them, they are not put on a pedestal and the mods will usually [[permaban]] them for their rebelliousness.

Not only are secrets revealed within these posts, but many conflicts have also been started. Below are a few infamous excerpts from said anonymous posts.

{{quote|[http://www.livejournal.com/~simpleyetcolin simpleyetcolin] You're not really funny or insulting and it's come to the point where I feel like we're sitting in the 3rd grade cafeteria and you keep handing me your shitty mashed potatoes that no one likes, and it's like, just stop already, I don't want your mashed potatoes. So if you could just not waste my time and yours, that would be awesome, thaaaaaanks.|[http://www.livejournal.com/~corrinezilla corrinezilla]}}

{{quote|when I masturbate, I refuse to go too far because I want a boy to make me organism for the first time.|''(Anonymous)''}}

{{quote|anon posts always make me masturbate.|''(Anonymous)''}}


These posts may/will consist of icon [[spam]], [[meme]] [[spam]], and [[pix]] of guys these hormonal girls want to fux (the vast majority are Models and FBR members.

===Ftaires' Corner===
Pretentious indie fuck [http://www.livejournal.com/~ftaires ftaires] had started creating random posts, what he identified as <i>Ftaires' Corner</i>, on Tailj. He was later banned due to no one giving a fuck. He then decided to move his corners to the shittier side of the internet -- where a conveniently placed Fbrt was awaiting his arrival.

He posts approximately once every week and his posts are usually almost always shit stained.
They either consist of one or more of the following:
*Lame indie bands that no one gives a fuck about
*Lame indie bands that like 2 people give a fuck about
*Shitty songs on autoplay that no one gives a fuck about
*Lost
*Made up Fbr shit that has the potential to be funny but is usually overshadowed by his pretentious indie fuck ways therefore no one gives a fuck

He continuously begs to be unbanned but when his wishes are granted he continues being a huge dickhead.

{{quote|If you're too much of a pussy to post un-anonymously, you have no right to talk shit. :/|Ftaires}}

The mods don't care about these ridiculous posts because they are too busy fangirling ftaires seeing as he is the only male in the community that:
*posts regularly.
*is old enough for them not to feel guilty about fapping to his pics. (sorry, simpleyetcolin)
But in reality, ftaires is just another douchebag using livejournal to create unrealistic sentiments of his own importance. Oh, and he's gay.

==The Demise==

[[Image:15501385wo2.jpg|thumb|Blame it on the_last_detour.|right]]
On April 1st, 2008 Fbr_T was deleted.  It is rumored that this is because [[pussy|Keltie Colleen]] (known for trying to fuck [[women|Ryan Ross]] and being a [[stripper|dancer]]) lurked and got all butthurt so she whined to the mods until they complied.  She should totally just [[an hero|kill herself]].

{{quote|keltie colleen can suck my dick. 
why the fuck does she care what an internet community says about her ass? it's not like she wants to be some big CEO or the next Oprah Winfrey. She's a fucking Rockette - and last time I checked, being talked about online doesn't really affect your ability to can-can. She should grow a pair of cojones and realize that the internet is not as serious business as she wishes it were, and take responsibility for her own epic failure, and not blame a bunch of fifteen year old girls for problems in her real life.
