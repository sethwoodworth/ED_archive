Sarah Monahan's Vagina
[[Hey_Dad..!|Hey, Dad!]] was an Australian sitcom from the [[Last Thursday|1980's]] featuring a [[pedophile]] architect, his daughters (of which at least one was delicious and ultimate irresistible [[loli]], a bimbo [[ginger]] secretary, two [[retard|mentally challenged]] male characters and an annoying fat kid who went on to become both the national face of toilet paper, and a [[Christian|Christian Missionary]].

Had this been where the story ends, this in itself would not be worth of ED's attention, beyond some awkward masturbation for some of the more [[You|fucked up]] readers.

However, like [[Glenn Beck|Glenn Beck, who raped and murdered a young girl in 1990]], this show had a dirty little secret. That dirty little secret was Sarah Monahan's Vagina.
