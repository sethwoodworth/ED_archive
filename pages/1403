Cerebus
{{needsmoar|humor}}
'''''Cerebus''''' is a black-and-white [[furry]] [[comic]] series starring a talking [[LOLWUT|Aardvark]]. It started [[at least 100 years ago]] as a poorly-drawn ''[[Gay|Conan the Barbarian]]'' parody and ended [[last Thursday]] as a somewhat-better-drawn narrative and philosophical [[Fail|trainwreck]]. At 300 issues and [[Over 9000|over 6,000]] pages ''Cerebus'' is the <s>[[shit nobody cares about|longest-running originally English-language comic book series ever by a single creative team]]</s> definition of [[TL;DR]]. 

''Cerebus'' is most notable as a record of the [[mindfuck|mental disintegration]] of its [[Canadian]] author, Dave Sim, who over the course of its creation  went [[batshit insane]], became a  radical [[misogynist|anti-feminist]], and bored his readers with endless pages of non-comics [[Butthurt|whining]] about the opposite sex. He insisted that this [[misogyny|opposition to feminism]] didn't make him a misogynist, despite [[Bullshit|metaphysical]] discourses in which [[ALL CAPS|Every other Word is Capitalized for Emphasis]] about how the "[[Rape|Female Void devours the Male Light]]" [http://www.theabsolute.net/misogyny/sim.html] and [[Asking for it|passionate arguments in favor of rape]] ([[srsly]]).

No surprise coming from a gender which has no ethics, no scruples, no sense of right and wrong.|Dave Sim, [[irony|not a misogynist]]}} 

He then declared himself a [[fundamentalist]] <s>[[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|Muslim]]</s> (one religion wasn't crazy enough for him, so he read the Jew, [[Bible]], and [[Koran|Qu'ran]] and decided to combine the [[crazy]] from all three). He now gets his kicks from [[pro-ana|fasting]], not touching his [[penis]], [[cutting|prayer]], not letting anybody else touch his [[penis]], alms-giving, and trying to pretend he doesn't have a [[penis]]. Dave's conversion to this [[batshit insane|unique]] form of [[conservatism]] caused much [[drama]] among [[Loser|people who take comics seriously]], and simply mentioning his name can be an effective [[troll]]ing technique in comics forums.[http://tcj.com/messboard/viewtopic.php?t=3057]

The originator of the thread referenced above, summed the situation up very succinctly and in delicious lulzy fashion thus:

{{quote|Just stop for a moment, Danny, amidst the turmoil and travails that is your daily existence, and consider this; Lets say you, yourself, had drawn 300 issues of a comicbook about an aardavark. Then, to add insult to injury, you started having deep and penetrating insights on the subject of man/woman relationships, and the whole biological/physiological ramifications of that, pertaining to the conclusion that those damn cunts are just no damn good. And then, on top of that, as if your over-worked brain wasn't already teeming (veritably) with sharp and keen insight in that regard. You then, decided to read the holy scripture (editing out those tainted chapters written by those no good, vaginally-impaired Biblical prophets) and somehow added Muhammad as the final word -- from Moses to Jesus to Muhammad (it all makes perfect sense after 300 some issues of an aardvark-infested comicbook manifesto). And then, on top of that, you subjected yourself to endless critical abuse from the razor-sharp mind of no less than Gary Groth.|acebackwords, bringing the [[lulz|truth]]}}
