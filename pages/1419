[[File:ChanThreadWatch2.png|thumb|500px|right]]
'''Chan Thread Watch''' is a program which allows you to monitor a shit load of threads from 95% of chans. It will download all the images and the HTML file, Then it will keep checking it. Downloading fuck tons of [[pr0n]] has never been easier. It is written in C# and requires the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=5b2c0358-915b-4eb5-9b1d-10e506da9d0f .NET Framework 2.0] to run. It's open source, and is able to run on [[Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac]] (the latter two via [http://www.mono-project.com/ Mono]).

The developer is lazy, however manages to update it when necessary.

==Installation==
[http://sites.google.com/site/chanthreadwatch/ Download], unzip, and run. Keep it on a flash drive for on the go fapping.

==Usage==
* 1. Copy paste the URL of the thread into that box that says URL
* 2. Select the interval you want to check the thread at (1 minute is best for 4chan /b/, most threads on other boards/chans don't 404 that quickly, so higher intervals work)
* 3. ADD THREAD
* 4. Fap away

If you close the program, it will save the list of active threads and restore them when you start it again.
