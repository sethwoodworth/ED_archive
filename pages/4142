Israblog
[[Image:Typical_israblog_user.JPG|thumb|Typical user's blog, contained with the regular bullshit attention whores write about]]

'''Israblog''' is a [[blog]] portal, based in [[israel|jewland]] except that it's a magnet for [[attention whore]]s, [[13 year old boy]]s and [[16 year old girls]] '''in Hebrew'''. Because it's in a Jew language, it is automatically assumed that everyone there is Jewish, and as such, Israblog reeks of Jewish [[faggotry]].

Because Israblog is only one of its kind (probably because hebrew is such a shitty language only Jews ever bother to study it), it has become the universal portal for the aforementioned [[attention whore]]s who, either by choice or stupidity, whore for their attention, boost egos by bragging about their number of hits, or any other form, but '''in Hebrew'''. Israblog also helps propagate [[internet drama]] by listing completely useless information like common birthdays, [[n00b|newcomers]] and RSS feeds on its main site. The site even states that the [[shit]] written by their attention whores actually belongs to the attention whores and not the Israblog host, a major improvement in Company-User relations since every major company realized their EULAs are [[crap]].

As for the shitty Hebrew language and its rules, pretty much like English, the [[13 year old boy]]s and [[16 year old girls]] managed to totally butcher whatever rules the language has, as [[1337]]speak and all variations of [[netspeak]] has somehow infiltrated the Jewry of Israblog and took over the Jewish part of the [[internets]].

Naturally, the [[the Internet Is Serious Business|seriousness of the internet]] is undisputed, for in Israblog, due to [[israel]]'s small size, everyone knows everyone [[IRL]], and friends who know each other [[IRL]] do indeed whore for attention together, as well as (naturally) add each other to their friends lists. Unfortunately for them, [[internet drama]] regarding their precious possessions often seeps into [[RL]] [[drama]], making some [[troll]] who managed to instigate the drama [[a plus|A+]].

Jew greed has infiltrated the Israblog site as well with [[ebaum]]-esque ads. Unless you're bored to fucking death, do not enter the site. It's not like you'll understand anything there, it's too Jewish.
