This article refers to current events and may change based on [[old media|the news]].

A '''deadpool''' is a betting pool where the gamble is on who will die first. Much like horse racing, fancy bets like trifectas are allowed, even encouraged.

[[Rotten.com]] maintains a deadpool where end users are awarded points for selected persons who die in a given year. There is also a deadpool called [[Death List]] which has been [[shit]] at predicting who's going to die since [[2007]].

==That Other Deadpool Guy==
'''Deadpool''' is the the name of a popular Marvel Comics character, who was killed at the end of the new [[shit|fantastic]] ''[[Wolverine]]'' [[movie]]. However, '''that''' Deadpool was completely different from the comic book version of himself, something his [[fanboys|fans]] [[Nerd_rage|found perfectly acceptable]]. 

Deadpool, the comic book character, is known for breaking the fourth wall by speaking to readers and commenting on the [[Disney|Marvel]] universe in general. Amazingly enough, Deadpool actually can be funny and his [[Sick fuck|twisted sense of humor]] has made him popular across [[/b/]] and [[4chan]] in general.  [[Gay|Ryan Reynolds]], who played Deadpool in the ''Wolverine'' movie will return to his role in a standalone ''Deadpool'' film, which will [[Truth|completely ignore everything that happened to Deadpool in the Wolverine movie.]] Even so, expect [[butthurt]] fanboys to bitch and moan about how [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|HE'S NOT BEING DONE RIGHT]] [[oneoneone|AGAIN!!!1!1!111!1]]
