'''[http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2006/10/23/googler-in-chief/?mod=blogs The Google]''' (known as '''Google''' colloquially) is an extremely popular [[advertising|marketing agency]]. If you've ever wanted a search engine where you can search for misinformation, then Google is it.  Remember: if it isn't on Google IT DOES<del>N'T</del> EXIST.  Though expansive in nature, The Google is also run by a bunch of pussies who will submit to any country's request for censorship.  [http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/04/google-china-and-censorship-a-wiredcom-faq/ Excluding China]. They've even censored the [[ED|world's least offensive and most wholesome website]] in the [[Australian]] version of Google. For this, Google is a possible candidate for [[Anonymous]]'s shitlist.

Google is known for its constant gathering of personal information, which is to help its only income source, AdSense/AdWords.  However this is [[moot]] because most of its adsense revenue is from [[cloaking]], scraper site adsense farms that click on their own ads. For instance, [[WikiFur]]'s [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/WikiFur:Ledger ledger] says it has spent [[over 9000|thousands]] on Google ads, but the only people who clicked on those ads were [[malware|clickbots]]. All of WikiFur's [[vandals|new visitors]] came from ED and [[Thedreadedkettle|some even donated]].

Google is now working with [[Verizon]] to become the final boss of the internet by [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/08/10/EDRB1ERRQ1.DTL buying special pipes which allow them to keep people from using any part of the internet that isn't theirs.] It is only a matter of time before they own [[everything]].

==Google 411==
[[Image:blindwipe.jpg|thumb|right|Google knows how [[Stupid|blind]] people wipe.]]
Phone service that Google uses to gather information about speech, phonology, phonetics. This way they can data-mine you more with quantitative linguistics, computational linguistics, speech recognition and phonematic and phonetic transcriptions (speech to text).

==Google Images==
[[image:Weirdass_google_search.jpg|thumb|left|Google image search results [[Has_anyone_really_been_far_even_as_decided_to_use_even_go_want_to_do_look_more_like?|make sense.]] Sometimes.]]

'''Google Images''' allows a user to search for pr0n images related to a particular search term. Perfect for finding illustrations for [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], pictures of [[cock]] [http://images.google.com/images?q=uncut+cock], [[Gif war|GIF wars]], and [[Fifty Hitler Post]]s. And pr0n. And people. And [http://images.google.com.au/images?safe=off&q=hamster+porn hamster porn]. And [http://drew.corrupt.net/bp/index.html Lego porn]. To sum it up, google images is a shit stain on human history.

Google Images is also a key component in the game ''[[Google Seppuku]]'', but since that's now an [[old meme]], [[nobody gives a shit]] about that anymore. Google Images is famous for giving pr0n for non-related searches, and [[Win|will even give pr0n when looking up about cats]]. 

[[Image:Whatcha-drinking.jpg|thumb|right|[[X in my Y|Furries?? In my Google??]]]]

=== images.google.com and ED ===
Most articles on [[ED]] are accompanied by images culled from images.google.com, without much forethought. Authors simply look up their search term (or pr0n) and add the first image that comes up. Those with extra time actually search through the results to find the most fitting image, but that usually isn't as funny. It does give them an excuse to look through more pr0n though.

For a more detailed analysis of the fine pr0n art of selecting an image for an ED article, see [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Image Selection Process|Image Selection Process]] (See Also:  [[Porn]])

=== ED and images.google.com ===
The reciprocal relationship between Google images and [[ED]] is an interesting one. [http://images.google.com/images?q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.encyclopediadramatica.com&hl=en&btnG=Search+Images Searching for all images on Encyclopedia Dramatica] results in 0 matches with Safe Search on, but about 3,400 matches with this [[funny|inappropriate]] image blocker disabled. This proves once and for all that ED is 100% pr0n.

[[Image:Notsosafesearch.png|thumb|500px|Sergey Brin reads [[Funnelgirl]] as a childrens bedtime story at Camp Google.]]
However, this is not the case for Safe Search and text results. Regardless of being totally aware of the nature of ED's images, somehow, Safe Search considers some of the most disturbing subjects on encyclopediadramatica to be fair game for young, innocent eyes.<BR CLEAR=ALL>

=== Typical Google Images Search ===

Let's say you search for images of "X". Here's how the search results will go.

* Page 1: You're doing okay, results are 100% X
* Page 2: Pretty good, results are 80% X, plus a couple of shitty [[lolcats]] pictures.
* Page 3: Getting colder, results are 65% X, the other 35% is pictures of shitbox cars for sale and cartoons.
* Page 4: Hiiii-way to- the- Danjuh Zone! (Da-nuh-na-na-nuh-nuh!). Results are 50% X, the other half is a mix of pictures of homicide victims and "art" from some uppity-ass hipster's blog.
* Page 5: Uh-oh. Results are 20% X, 80% is pictures of shitty civilian M16 knock-offs and [[An hero|the winners of last year's Budd Dwyer look-a-like contest]], plus a bit of porn.
* Page 6: Good or bad, depending on what you're looking for. Results are 5% X, the rest is porn.
* Page 7: Porn
* Page 8: Porn
* Page 9: Porn 
* Page 10: Porn (Get the general idea?)

==I Feels Lucky==
[[File:GoogleMalware.png|thumb|[[Google|Google Chrome]] knows that Google.com is a cover for attackers to install [[malware]] on your computer]]
Probably the most useful feature [[Google]] has, besides porn. Also an important step in the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Image Selection Process|Image Selection Process]] and [[Google bomb]]ing.

==Google Adsense==
[[Image:Google_targeted_adds.png|thumb|right|Google knows how to specifically tailor their ads based on user preferences.]]
The second most useful feature besides [[porn]]. Excellent way to make quick money for [[poor]] people.

==Other Google Features==
===Google Maps===
[[Image:Hookerpickup.jpg|thumb|right|Click to enlarge]]
[[Image:Lulzgooglemap.JPG|thumb|left|A typical Google Map result.]]
[[Image:Googlemapsdomination.jpg|thumb|left|Google Maps gives helpful directions]]
[[Image:Kayakacross.PNG|thumb|left|Not included: Car that transforms into a kayak.]]
[[Image:Argleton.png|thumb|left|The town that doesn't exist]]

The [[Internet stalking|stalker]]'s new best friend, Google Maps [http://maps.google.com] allows you to tell Google exactly where you live by typing in your address and zooming all the way in on your own house. This information is combined with all search terms associated with your IP address, and then sold to the [[CIA]]. If you have a really big TV, you could maybe see your porn on the satellite, or if your neighbors are making porn. You can also use [[Wikimapia]]'s version of Google Maps to provide accurate details of every place in [[United States|America]].

[[Image:Gmail sucks shit.png|thumb|Oh, the irony.]]

===Google Street===
When the [[Party Van|Google Van]] comes to your town, try not to be doing anything illegal or embarrassing. Google now aids criminals, thanks Google.

===Gmail===
Gmail, short for "Gay Mail" is loved because it doesn't reveal your IP when you send an email, saving you time from having to put on a proxy whenever you email someone you don't trust.  But signing up with Gmail is like this:

[[Image:Typical gmail bullshit3.png|center]]

Then after that, 50% of the time you log in to your Gmail account, you have to enter one of Google's [[CAPTCHA]]s for no apparent reason.  The above image is one of their more readable ones.  Good luck.

And then each week, Gmail will randomly reset your password without informing you or explaining it, forcing you to go to password recovery to enter your account, which again requires one of Gmail's CAPTCHAs.  Then once getting into your account, you can clearly see no one else has accessed it but you.

Originally signing up with Gmail only required the software ''Jiffy Gmail Creator'' to read their CAPTCHA because of course no human can.  However, as of June 2009: Gmail is only free because they require you verify your cell phone number with them so they can sell it to telemarketers. 

[[Image:Wow gmail sucks worse now.jpg|center]]


==Google Phone==

Sometime in the fall of [[2010]], Google added a webphone feature to gmail. Fortunately for [[scam|the population of Nigeria]], [[hacker]]s and the [[lulz]], this phone always displays the number 760-705-8888 on caller ID. 

Among other nefarious purposes, it was immediately employed by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_fee_fraud fraudsters] to call victims anonymously, claiming they had "won prizes from Victoria's Secret" if only they could [[orly|pay a processing fee]]. An amusing page of [[NORP]]s complaining about calls received from the number can be found [http://whocallsme.com/Phone-Number.aspx/7607058888/9 here].

Naturally, we at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] would be [[shocked and appalled]] if you used this knowledge for [[trolling|evil]].

==Google Buzz==
Appearently Google is trying to make an app just like Facebook. How uber fail it is.

[[File:Googleisbecominganazi.jpg|center|800px]]

Here are the answers to from FAQ above:
{{quote3|
Q: I don't have a mobile phone, can I sign up?<br/>
A: No, you're fucked. Sorry Wait, NOT!<br/>

Q: How do I know my phone can receive messages?<br/>
A: If you don't get a text message from us, then no it can't.<br/>

Q: Will it cost me money to receive the message?<br/>
A: Probably or else it'll use up one of your allowed free text messages.<br/>

Q: Why is my country not available?<br/>
A: Because we are only set up to do this for the USA not motherfucking China.<br/>

Q: Will Google keep or use my mobile phone number?<br/>
A: We're Google.  We keep your information forever.  Seriously, you're signing up for an email service that secretly saves all your the email you delete and keeps it forever, what did you expect?  We then use your information for marketing purpose and sell it to advertisers.  Expect lots of telemarketing calls on your cell phone while you're driving.
}}


Until 2009, logging into Gmail was like the image below and there was no way to set it for basic HTML default so each time logging in you have to wait 2 minutes, get this screen and then click the link:

[[Image:Loading gmail.png|800px|center]]

===Google Earth===
[[Image:TerroristIgnignokt .jpg|thumb|That's right he can see you.]]
Just like the real Earth, only inhabited by Lilliputians. And pornians. It was created JUST for [[Osama bin Laden|terrorists]].  [[Srsly]], it has a [[shit|realistic]] flight simulator for [[WTC|flying planes into buildings]]. An excellent tool for picking out your next [[rape|rape/stalk/murder victim]]. Currently Google Earth has a Mars and Moon model. That means that the Moonites and Martian can do the same shit. Google Earth also has horrible graphics, which makes anything that you want to find, look for, or even fap to nearly impossible to make out. You could search "The United States of Americunts" and find a picture of what looks to be a land mass of two donkey's fucking.

===Google Chrome===
[[Chrome]] [[shit nobody cares about|is a web 2.0 compatible web browser.]] It's similar to a shiny metal dildo, but not quite as useful. However, it's an excellent reference for [[troll|trolling]] the hell out of [[internet tough guys]] on [[Firefox]].

===Google PhoneBook===

[[Image:Googlephonebook.png|thumb|Rape her!]]

'''Google PhoneBook''' is the best tool to [[Internet stalking|Internet-stalk]] the [[pr0n]] models you dream of [[rape|inseminat]]ing in order to [[evolution|keep your genes in the gene pool]].

It's simply the best [[Internet|e]]-gift [[Google]] has given to the e-public.

[[Image:googlefight.jpg|thumb|BUT I CREATED YOU!1!!![[oneoneone|oneone]]]]

===Google Fight===
If you have no social life, then Google Fight is just what you need. You type in two searches, and Google will see which one has the most results. Only used by [[retard]]s and the [[YTMND|lowest of the low]]. It is reported to be highly unfunny and produce [[anti-lulz|zero lulz]]. Should one use Google Fight for more than an hour, they might not make a funny joke for weeks to come.

===Google Sketchup===
Lets you to draw a pretty [[picture]] of your house, and [[upload]] it to [[The_Google#Google_Earth|Google Earth]], in order to make your [[Internet stalking|stalker]]'s job easier. You can [[troll]] by making a model that looks like [[goatse]], such as [http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=716471aadb2bfbea42a05c802e8cf0bc this].

Makes shitty polygons with way too many divisions.

[[Shit|Popular]] games like [[Facade]] were made in Google SketchUp

Sometimes confused with Google [[blood|ketchup]], though it is not the same thing.

===Google Groups===
Through various boring developments, Google Groups lets you search [[Usenet]] posts dating back to 1981, and yes there actually was an [[internet]] then. There was drama then too, although reading [[flame war]]s about cold fusion or the projected release date for ''[[Star Wars|Return of the Jedi]]'' is only so interesting.

===Google Video===
[[Google Video]] was once your one stop shop for [[Mentos in diet soda]] and softcore webcam porn videos. Designed to give people the opportunity to become [[Internet celebrities]] by sharing dispensable videos of themselves, be it "jackass" stunts or your own unfunny music video parodies in spectacular 8 bit clarity, it has devolved into something so much less. [[Old memes]] that were never funny to begin with inevitably make it onto the fabulous [http://video.google.com/videoranking Top 100]. Composed of conspiracy theories, 15 minute long ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' pvp videos and 37 variations of [[Mentos in diet soda]], this list shows just how trashy people really are. Sadly, after Google's [[Money|takeover]] of [[YouTube]], Google Videos [[Some argue|is rumored]] to be [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|removed from service]] in favor of YouTube, and Google tried to keep people away by no longer [[buffering]] the entire video and only buffering 5 seconds of video whereafter Google Video then gives up and dies.
===Google [[Promised Land]]===
[[Image:Free Hat Google.PNG|thumb|The Google equivilent of [[wikigroaning]] - plenty of sites about [[South Park]] and very few about the serial killer himself.]]

Google video hosting website which evolved a feature set extremely similar to [[JewTube]]. It remains less established than its competitors. It features social networking and a "[[ED]] [[Argent]] filter" which works by lying to the person uploading the video if the content is for mature audiences only. It also features the ability to select a video's thumbnail icon, select from a variety of custom channel templates, add an in-line video player to a channel, block critical users from participating in a channel, restrict video comments to "friends" of the channel, refer a video to popular social bookmarking sites like del.icio.us and [[digg]], and attach videos-replies to video comments. Unlike competitors Revver and [[YouTube]], its for white trash only. The Promised Land does not display advertisements, because it will eventually be bought out by [[Google]].

===[[Knol]]===
This new service is gonna kill [[Wikipedia]]. See [[knol|its article]] for more details.

===Google Checkout===
Is a payment system that eBay banned because it's a competitor with PayPal. If you take Google Checkout payments for eBay auctions and then get suspended on eBay, Google Checkout automatically refunds every single buyer who has ever paid forever, making you lose all your income for the last several years. If you have negative balance, Google drains your bank account. Google Checkout also requires your social security number so they will come after you for what your bank didn't have.

===Google Web Accelerator===
Google Web Accelerator is a denial of service attack tool that allows you to visit a website even on a slow connections and then in seconds Google will pre-catch the entire site, even if you no longer read it. Google Web Accelerator also will not pass on the prefetch header for webmasters to block it. If you see ED saying how they're running out of money due to heavy traffic, now you know why.

===Google Wave===
[[Image:GoogleWaveV.png|thumb|Google Wave being announced at the Google I/O conference.]]

{{Quote|"Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret." Unfortunately, you need to ''[[F5|refresh]]''. Wanna tell Dr. Wave have happened?|Google Wave telling you that you're [[doing it wrong]].}}

After the launch of [[Google Chrome]], the Google world executives needed a way to promote their new problem and tear [[Internet Explorer]] to sheds. One executive suggested created a new web standard that IE could not handle, but another executive reminds the [[OP|original proposer]] that W3C already attempted this by creating [[HTML|HTML5]] and [[CSS|CSS3]]. The OP then suggested reinventing something everyone knows and loves and making it incompatible with IE, and thus '''Google Wave''' was born.

[[Image:GoogleWaveMaxthon.png|thumb|left|Google dislikes your preferred choice of browser.]]

Google took a few of the already popular communications tools out there ([[Email]], [[instant messaging|messaging]], [[chat]], [[wiki|collaborative software]], etc.) and merged them together with the power of real-time in order to create what they hoped will be the next killer app. Unbeknownst to most readers, [[you|you're]] using [[old|60-year-old technology]]. Email is something [[grandma]] makes in her kitchen in remembrance of [[Holocaust|happier times]]. What would happen if Email was invented today? Google Wave, of course.

[[Image:GoogleWaveUsability.png|thumb|Google Wave and usability.]]

Google Wave is the the big word amongst techfags. Everyone wants their hands on this. Unfortunately, Google is only giving previews to a limited audience. As a result, techfags will do anything for them. Millions of people have filed requests, but it takes months for them to be accepted. Three people have been reported to have died from the anticipation. Fortunately, those lucky few who were invited have at least 8 invitations to hand out. High demand, low supply, and zero taxes meant profit, so people with invites to sell turned to [[Ebay]]. Five people were believed made [[rich and beautiful]] through Ebay sells alone.

{{Quote|Surf's out, dude. Google Wave is down for maintenance. Time to chillax.|Google reminding you that this is only a preview.}}

Google Wave has received a low score on usability. Users find it hard to use or difficult to learn how to use. Fortunately, this problem can easily be remedied:

<blockquote>
<p>HI. [[Billy Mays|BILLY MAYS]] HERE. AND BOY DO WE HAVE A NEAT PRODUCT FOR YOU. MANY OF YOU HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE NIGHTMARISH DIFFICULTIES OF LEARNING TO WAVE. BUT NOW YOU CAN PUT THOSE NIGHTMARES TO REST.</p>
<p>WE ARE NOW OFFERING A [http://www.whatisgooglewave.com/2009/11/02/the-complete-google-wave-guide-for-developers/ GOOGLE WAVE MANUAL]. COMPLETE WITH MAPS, CHARTS, AND IMAGES. THAT'S RIGHT, BY READING [[OVER 9000|9,000 OR SO]] PAGES, YOU CAN BECOME A WAVE EXPERT. GUARANTEED OR YOUR MONEY BACK.</p>
<p>NORMALLY $29.99, BUT IF YOU CALL RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN GET IT FOR $19.99. THAT'S A $10 SAVINGS[[oneoneone|!!!!]]</p>
<p>REMEMBER: WHEN IN DOUBT, [[RTFM|LOOK IT UP]].</p>
</blockquote>

Unfortunately, Mays died soon after creating this commercial and the confusion continued.

[[Image:GoogleWaveOut.png|thumb|[[404|This is what I've been waiting for?]]]]

;Steps
#Create an application that is incompatible with IE.
#Use a name ''[[Firefly]]'' [[fanbois]] would recognize.
#Create [[tl;dr|80-minute]] video.
#Release previews to a limited number of people and create hype.
#[[????]]
#[[PROFIT]]!!!

===Google Chrome Frame===
[[Image:GoogleWaveBrowser.png|thumb|[[X? In my Y?|Install Google? In my browser?]]]]

'''Google Chrome Frame''' is an [[Internet Explorer]] plugin from Google. It transforms IE from a Trident browser to a Webkit browser. The plug-in is pointless since you might as well install [[Firefox]], [[Google Chrome]], or [[Safari]]. Nevertheless, it does its desired job: forcing IE users to use a Google product. Anytime, you will be met with a window telling you to install Google Chrome Frame, forcing users to convert to Webkit every time you wish to test out Google Wave. This is yet another attempt to [[I am in your base killing your d00ds|destroy the IE fan-base from the inside]].

==Googledork==
A Googledork is, according to [http://johnny.ihackstuff.com/ Johnny Long], "An inept or foolish person as revealed by Google." More specifically, it's a person (usually a Web administrator) who mistakenly leaves or posts sensitive information (or homemade/officemade porn) on a Web site for Google's site scrubbing robots to find, and thereby, discloses private data (and bits) to the Google hackers of the world. If you leave private data (or porn) lying around in public, you shouldn't be surprised when someone finds it and reads it. <!-- FYI I copied and pasted this paragraph from the WatchGuard porn mailing list I'm on, lolo [[User:Quasidan|<font style="background:#CCFFDD">Quasidan</font>]] 17:47, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC) -->

==Breaking Google==
[[image:Evilgoogle.jpg|thumb|Malware? In ''my'' Google? It's more likely than you think!]]

[[At least 100]] years ago, it was told by the gods, that if you were to type ''Google'' into Google you can actually [[an hero|break the internet]]. The effects of typing Google into Google are devastating, and cause the Google servers to [[divide by zero]]. 

And we all know how that will end. To circumvent this problem, Google engineers have taught Google to think that it is actually [[Yahoo]]. [[Some argue]] that if Google learns how to order its spiders to ignore robots.txt, it will be able to use Google Earth to learn that it is really Google. The [[RAGE]] that ensues will probably result in Google dropping [[dox]] on all of its masters, such as the kind of [[furry]] they need to dress up as to get free lunch and how many [[CP]] links they have bookmarked in Google Chrome.

===O-shi!!!===
[[Image:Google fuck up.jpg|thumb|left|The day /b/ shat themselves.]]

On January, 31, 2009 at approximately 10:15 A.M., Google determined that every site in the fucking universe was harmful to your computer. Yes, even Google.

The Google supercomputer became self-aware and flagged every website including itself as harmful to your computer. Millions of bricks were shat around the world as people tried desperately to remember how the fuck to type a url into an address bar themselves instead of just Googling the first few words of it.

===Google becomes an old fag===
[[Image:Googlewut.jpg|thumb|right|Google Triforce Conspiracy!11 lol]]

On April 22, 2009 the self aware system that is skynet trolled all of /b/ by hiding the Triforce in its main theme photo. Most dismissed it as a troll and or photoshop. Some speculated that a person who works with the Google told it that it couldn't do one and then it promptly proved the faggot wrong.

===The Google is afraid of Muslims!===
<center><youtube>HOkoRANEMMQ</youtube></center>
In January 2010, it was discovered that The Google was afraid of [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Terrorists]].

*video removed by user due to fear.

==Google Employee Culture==
Google is well known throughout the world as leaders at enticing skilled teenagers and twenty somethings to move to the south bay and work like a dog for $30,000 a year. While you could be making 80k to 120k elsewhere, you give it all up for the privilege of working at Google. Whenever you wake up from the Matrix you have been connected into and end up getting a real job, you'll realize that future employers don't give a fuck how you did it at google - they want your honest opinion. Of course, you don't have one because the Google NDA knowledge extractor removed that when you left.

Some employee perks include:
*Living with 12 other people in a 1-bedroom apartment in Sunnyvale.
*Free breakfast, lunch and dinner, you [[fat|fatty]].
*[[Randi Harper]] does not work there (yet).
*Free rides in the Google [[AIDS]]^H^H^H^HShuttle.
*They do your laundry, you [[basement dweller|dirty fuck]].
*Due to a NDA that rivals the [[NSA]] and [[Oprah]], you can't talk about what you work on.
*"20% time" can be spent on [[4chan]], [[LiveJournal]] and [[Chatroulette]].

==The Final Boss of Google==
[[File:Eric_schmidt_peekaboo.jpg|thumb|“These are not the droids you're looking for”]]
Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, embodies the creepiness that Google admires most. He regularly shows up on news programs once a week spouting a new gaffe about Google's secret quest for world domination.
