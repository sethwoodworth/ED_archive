Deadly.org
The original '''deadly.org''' was a small, [[OpenBSD]]-centric news site. It no longer exists today, having been replaced by [http://www.undeadly.org undeadly.org] following an [[April Fool's]] prank gone wrong. 

== The Failed April Fool's Day Joke ==

On April 1, 2004, the [[moderator]]s at deadly.org, in a brazen display of [[Attention Whore | attention whoring]], announced that they had grown tired of administering the site, and were closing it down. There was much outcry from regular readers, as was intended.

What was not intended was for one of those readers to put up another site with the exact same format, and even their old important information, within a matter of hours, stating he would gladly step in to carry on the tradition and provide a place for the users to get their OpenBSD news.

Only later was it revealed that the stunt was just a practical joke, and that they had not intended to let the site die. [[I accidentally X|Oops]].
