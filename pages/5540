A '''mundane''' is somebody who isn't [[batshit crazy]]. The word is typically used by [[:Category:Subcultures|sexual deviants]] who suffer from megalomania, but varies according to group:


*[[Goth]]s / [[Emos]] - ''Mundame''
*[[Jews]] - ''Goyim'' ( meaning "cattle")
*[[Scientologists]] - ''Pre-clear''
*[[Asperger's syndrome|Assburgers]] - ''Neurotypical''
*[[Atheists]] - ''[[Sheep]]'' *
*[[Faggots]] - ''[[Breeders]]'' (hetros only)
*[[Asexual|Asexuals]] - Sexuals ([[what|used as an insult]])
*[[Furries]] - Humans ([[what|used as an insult]])


Mundane users will usually not be found participating in [[LJ Drama]]. However, when backed into a corner it is possible to drive them to the point of [[insane|insanity]], causing them to go on a [[kamikaze]] rampage.

In fact, Mundanes will not be found participating in the internet much at all beyond the occasional Google search, Amazon purchase, or Ebay lurk. This can be remedied by recommending them to [http://www.lemonparty.org/enter.html a certain charity for the elderly],[http://www.meatspin.com/ a certain gay rights website], [[Offended|or ED's own collection of fine art photography]]. Viewing these pages will invariably scar the smooth, milk-colored surface of a Mundane's perception of humanity, while satisfying a Freudian curiosity that resides within them, with end result usually being complete destruction of their sanity.


<small>*NOTE: [[Furries]] do not use the term sheep, for fear of [[offending]] somebody's [[fursona]].</small>
