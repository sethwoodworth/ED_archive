'''Plastic Crap''' is the collection of [[Anime]] figurines, ''[[Star Wars]]'' vehicles, action figures, ''[[Simpsons]]'' statuettes, Gundams, "limited edition" J-list items and other made-in-[[China]]-by-child-slave-labor trash that [[Basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[nerds]] (often [[wapanese]]) surround themselves with. Like mold made of consumerism and [[lonely|loneliness]], Plastic Crap first appears in one area before spreading through the house, covering the walls with cheap shelving and endless rows of products designed for [[13 year old boys]].

The amount of Plastic Crap in a room is inversely proportional to the likelihood that the room will be used for [[secks]]; thus, increasing the collection beyond a certain point is a bold declaration of [[masturbation|celibacy]].

Taking it a step further, you can also display your plastic crap on your car. This makes [[neckbeard]] identification much, much easier.

Good thing is, your car becomes a really effective loli bait (or a pussy deflector).
