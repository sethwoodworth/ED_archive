'''''Jackass''''' is a [[television]] series about [[trolling IRL]] and shoving objects up one's ass.

It was created [[last Thursday]] when Johnny Cocksville sent some videos of himself [[Mr. Hands|down on the farm]] to a shitty skateboarding magazine which featured them in a gay flick. 

==TV Series==

Being completely [[recolor|original and witty]], MTV signed a bunch of fags to hurt themselves and terrorize the populous. Original episodes are famed for assholery involving simple, cheap stunts. In an early episode, they drop a leaking chemical tank in front of some [[negroes]] who in turn panic and sprint away in a [[lulzy]] fashion.

While it is true ''Jackass'' sold out the second MTV's balls touched their lips, most [[13 year old boys]] have never seen the original seasons (or original [[Family Guy]], [[South Park]], [[The Simpsons]]) and base judgments on present-day garbage.

==The Movie==

The [[fact]] that even one person watched this piece of [[shit]] is a blight on society.

After making enough cash the producers took it to the next step: a fuckin' movie. This turned out to be a stunt to [[RAPE|suck ten bucks from the wallets of gullible parents and teenagers with bad spending habits]]; ''Jackass: The Movie'' was just the TV show on a movie reel.

Attendance increased when it was revealed there was nudity in it but millions were disappointed to find that this nudity was just Steve-O's ass and they were once again forced to [[fap| search 'nudity' on Google Images]].

==Duh Sequels==

In true Hollywood fashion, ''Jackass'' had to be milked for all it's worth. The resulting sequels resulted in moar cock, anus and testicles, leading audiences to question if these movies are ways to show off their junk.

== Plagues on Popular Culture==

*Watching Steve-O stick a hose in his ass and butt-funnel beer.
*Various other anal insertions, including [[Bam Margera]]

==IRL Jackasses==

Imitators come with some pretty lulzy results.
