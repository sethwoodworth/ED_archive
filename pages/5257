Me versus the World
The 'Me Versus the World' [[Flame War]] is possibly the most stupid of all the flame wars. Any idiot can pull it off, and since the responses are all so predictable, very few [[lulz]] occur.

# A Flamer (or [[troll]], as is usually the case) targets a large group of people, usually a [[Livejournal|minority of subnormal intellect]].
# The troll then wages a full scale war against every single member of the community.
# The troll will invariably feel smug or self-righteous.

Here is a very common example of the 'Me Versus the World' Flame War:

* Budding young Flame Warrior finds an [[LJ]] community dedicated to victims of rape.
* Budding young Flame Warrior posts a delightful message to the effect of:
*:''Now, I'm a tolerant, understanding, sensitive guy, but people who are raped are always sexually provocative and generally sexually promiscuous harlots. I think we should adopt the [[Islam]]ic practice of stoning all rape victims to death. What are your thoughts, hussies?''
* All [[Hell]] breaks loose. If the budding young Flame Warrior appears to be losing, he'll just say: 'Hey, hey, hey! You stupid [[dyke]], I was [[j/k]]!!'
