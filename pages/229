'''Adequacy.org''' was a trolling/satire website established in 2001 for the purpose of publishing lulzy articles. Since by that time most people were beginning to figure out that the Onion wasn't for reals, Adequacy.org and other satire websites filled the useful gap of providing outrageous [[bullshit]] suitable for posting on forums and getting everybody mad, the fake articles were mostly about [[Nigra|nigras]], television and other shit. Because of the [[Emo|sensitivity]] of these subjects, it caused quite a bit of [[lulz]] and [[drama]].

==Sample Articles==

=== [[Is Your Son a Computer Hacker?]] ===
[[Old meme|Several years ago]] the Adequacy.org crew made a drama-inducing article about finding out if your child was a [[Hacker|h4x0r]], which caused many lulz when [[Pedophile|loving parents]] everywhere prevented their children from [[Pr0n|using the internets]]. The article was pure lulz to anyone who was not a dumbass.

===Trolling [[Jimbo Wales]]===
Adequacy.org effectively trolled [[Jimbo Wales]] himself, getting him to say he was a [[Randroid|anarchocapitalist gay]] and also kind of a gun nut. He also posted racist and homophobic comments, saying muslims are all "[[Truth|murderous thugs]]", and was butthurt about 9/11.

==Death and Rebirth==
Adequacy.org was shut down on 11 September 2002, which suggests [[Jews did WTC|foreign involvement]]. However the site is not up and running again, adding yet another [[troll]] site to the cancer-ridden face of the internet.
