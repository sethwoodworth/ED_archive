Wolfie

{{pixpls}}

Xephkaz Kkarnage (aka wolfie or Mami Inoue) Does not SAY she's a [[furry]], but one glimpse of her so-called artwork will tell you that she's not just a furry, she's (omg) a [[closet furry]]! But if you bring this up with her, she will assault you, saying that she is not a furry because furries are all about [[sex|teh sexxorz]], which incidentally, is true. And she [[lie|doesn't want furry sex.]]


== The Furry ==

An orange-furred (with pink runes) huskie/dragon/ghost mix that calls herself a [[vampire|third-blood]], her furry looks more like a psychadelic wolf than anything she should describe it to be. A four legged "feral" animal, she has two long black drago wings and a white tipped tail.

== The Person ==

Wolfie in real life is an unloved [[emo]] psuedo-goth who spends all her time molesting other dA users and watching over her own account like a mother hawk watching her breakfast. She virtually lacks a life and has droped out of school because she could not handle the pressure of her other peers. She constantly is at war with her family and goes completely emo whenever this (or furries) is brought up. This leads to hardcore [[lulz]] production, so you should do this at every possible occassion.

== She Lieks It ==

Wolfie has lots and lots of obsessions, ranging from Ron Perlman, or his alter-ego Hellboy to her various Role Play sites, including one she made up all by herself! She is in love with anthropomorphic creatures (but not n a sexual way, oh no no no!) but let's all remember, folks- she is NOT a furry.

== Hellboy ==

Wolfie has [[shit|spawned out]] [[at least 100]] pictures of Hellboy or her Hellboy/husky lovechild, whose name couldn't be remembered because no one cares. She has a nearly fanatical... oh what the hell, it's fanatical obsession with him and can be seen outside his door each night, waiting for him to love her.

== deviantArt ==

What does Wolfie love more than overmuscular demon [[fag]]s? Nothing! But her devantArt comes very close. She watches over it like a fucking fortress and checks her messaes at least 654060486050 times every hour. She also submits her art to it and watches [[at least 100]] others, almost all those others -you guessed it- [[furries]].

== She Dun Liek It ==

Not all Wolfie's life is happy. ): She hates her famly but two people and makes herself go emo on a daily basis whenever they start fighting, retreating for the time being back into Hellboy-world.

== Furries ==

Normally, [[h8]]ing furfags is a very redeeming quality, but it don't do shit when the person hating furries IS a furry. If anyone brings up the fact that she is one, she instantly goes [[batshit|into defcon 4]] and assaults you and all your kin with her walls of rants and whiny shit. This generates [[lulz]] in untold qualities, better even than the [[Habbo]] Hotel raids. Seriously. It's that fucking great.

== Social Interaction ==

Does Wolfie ever go outside? Does she have a fucking life? Will she ever have sex? If you answered "NO" to all three of those, you must know Wolfie very well. She rarely ever goes outside or leaves her computer (except to go to work. Gotta pay for dial-up service somehow!) and she wants to be a nun because she has accepted the fact that she will NEVER get [[laid]]. Ever. Never ever ever. So she keeps herself walled up in her room and cries.
