'''Debugging''' is what [[programmer]]s do to [[beta]] [[software]] to make it take up more room on your hard drive if it is running too efficiently.

== How to debug ==
#First you must write a program to debug, copy one off the [[internet]], or bang on the keyboard while having large [[cock|sausages]] tied to your fingers.
#Try to compile/run/[[masturbate|play]]/[[rape]] "your" program or [[whatever]].
#Work out which part of your program is not correct. The best way to do this involves either the trial-and-error method with a hex editor, or alternatively a [[Pagan|Ouija board]].
#Fix the code, or whine about it not working on a [[forum]] until someone does it for you.
#If it still doesn't work, [[srsly|seriously]], go whine about it on a [[forum]] until someone does it for you.
#Try again. If you don't get any errors, then your error checker is probably broken.
#When everything is working fine, publish the program on your [[Freewebs]] website, discuss it on a [[Proboards|Proboard]] and [[Unwarranted self-importance|write an article]] about how "OMG aws0m3" your [[Image]] [[penis|Organiser]][[â„¢]] is.
#?????
#[[profit|PROFIT!!!]]
