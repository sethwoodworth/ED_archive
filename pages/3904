I Don't Watch TV
'''"I Don't Watch TV"''' (or sometimes '''"I Don't Have A TV"''') is a [[lie|phrase]] commonly used by [[hippy|arty]], [[elitist]] [[lesbians|rug munchers]], [[gay|cocksuckers]] and [[fags]] of [[poor|all varieties]] (usually in a snarky fashion) to distance themselves from [[everyone|the rest of us cavemen]] when discussions arises about hot-topic [[fag|fanboy]] shows.

Example:

 Prima: '''"Did you see [[House]] last night?"'''
 Secunda: '''"Oh...I don't watch TV!"'''
 Prima: '''"...[[GTFO]]"'''


This [[unwarranted self-importance|statement]] is used either when they're too [[poor]] for cable or when a faggot thinks they are more [[liberal|cultured]] than you and have to [[fap|read books]] and go [[IRL]] for entertainment. It makes them feel better about their shitty lives when they get asked about [[Win|popular]] shows like [[South Park]], [[CSI]], [[Lost]], and [[Pimp My Ride]] that everyone talks about around the water-cooler.

Sometimes, you'll [[nice try|catch]] one of these fags out when they slip up and say something like "Watching the ''Little Mermaid'' DVD" in answer to the question "What are you up to?"  To which the best response is: [[Unfunny|"So what...you just rented the DVD and stare at the box?"]]  Similarly, [[at least 100]] percent of non-TV-watchers are fans of ''[[Firefly]]'','' Arrested Development'', seasons 1 and 2 of ''Family Guy'', ''[[furries|Freaks]] and [[otherkin|Geeks]]''...are you noticing a pattern here?

This [[cunt|species]] also frequently claim that they don't own a [[computer|comp00ting machine]], hate the [[Internets]] and don't even have an [[email]] address.
