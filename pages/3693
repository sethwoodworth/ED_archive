The word "hero" can apply to one of four main hero-classes.

=== The Ancient Hero ===
[[File:Greenlanternracist.jpg|thumb|left|Hal Jordan aka Green Lantern finally admits he hasn't done anything for African-Americans because he is racist.]]
Traditionally, heroes were the kind of men that could raze an entire village to the ground, slaughter the children, and be home with enough time to [[rape]] the [[women]] and eat dinner. [[Vikings]] are a prime example of the legendary heroes we laymen once worshiped as minor deities. It is thanks to the viking invasion of [[Scotland]] that there is still a large enough human-to-sheep-blood ratio to allow successful breeding of [[humans]]. If ever one finds themselves in the shadow of an ancient hero, they should be forewarned that they could get stepped on, or at the very least, [[almost raped]].

=== The Modern Hero ===

The modern hero, is any person who manages to capture the attention of stupid [[16-year-old girl|teenage girls]]. An example of a proclamation of heroism:

:''PrincessBrittany1122: [[liek]], omgwtfbbq, that singer is [[liek]], totaly HAWT, hes [[liek]], totaly mi HERO!!!11''
:''SekcStephie6969: omigod i no he is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo mien 2!''

=== The Real Hero ===
Everybody knows that real heroes, like [[Superman]], wear leotards. Firemen are not real heroes, contrary to popular belief; they are actually part of the [[Illuminati]] Jewish [[conspiracy]].

=== [[An hero]] ===
He was such an hero

to take it all away.

We miss him so, this you should know,

and we honor him this day.


He was an hero to take that shot

to leave us all behind.

God, do we wish we could take it back

And now he's on our minds.


Brother, nephew, son and friend

He was all these things and more.

Yes, we'll always remember seeing him

with his brains upon the floor.
