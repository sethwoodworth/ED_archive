Norichan822: Hello.
MusicNeutron: Who is this?
MusicNeutron: ?
MusicNeutron: Hello?
MusicNeutron: Who is this?
MusicNeutron: And how do you know me?
MusicNeutron: Where do you know me from I mean.
Norichan822: Nobody you actually know.
MusicNeutron: Oh really?
Norichan822: I've seen you on DA and Last.FM.
MusicNeutron: Where do you know me from.
MusicNeutron: Impossible.
Norichan822: Oh?
MusicNeutron: This handle isn't listed.
MusicNeutron: This handle is PRIVATE.
Norichan822: I'm an internet detective.
MusicNeutron: Yeah right
MusicNeutron: For all I know you're a hacker.
Norichan822: I heard you had some troubles with some trolls.
MusicNeutron: Yeah, and?
Norichan822: I'm here to help.
MusicNeutron: How did you get this screen name?
Norichan822: As i told you, I'm an internet detective, son.
Norichan822: Don't underestimate my abilities.
MusicNeutron: I never listed this handle anywhere.
MusicNeutron: So don't lie to me.
Norichan822: I'm not lying.
Norichan822: Stop being so paranoid.
Norichan822: See, that's you're problem.
Norichan822: it's on your ED page.
MusicNeutron: Who is this?
MusicNeutron: I'm not messing around.
Norichan822: An internet detective.
MusicNeutron: And how do you know who I am?
Norichan822: I friggin' told you.
MusicNeutron: You told me you knew me from two sites I'm on
Norichan822: Yep.
MusicNeutron: That's all you told m e.
MusicNeutron: *me
Norichan822: Who I am is not important.
MusicNeutron: And why do I get the feeling this is somebody I can't stand?
MusicNeutron: From those sites.
Norichan822: Pssh.
Norichan822: You think I'm a troll?
MusicNeutron: I don't know.
Norichan822: See, you're paranoid.
MusicNeutron: I don't know you from any of those two sites.
MusicNeutron: I don't recognize the name Norichan822.
Norichan822: That's because i never contacted you until now.
Norichan822: Doi.
Norichan822: Even if i told you who I was, you wouldn't know me.
Norichan822: So there's no point.
MusicNeutron: This is Shadow Blaziken, isn't it!
Norichan822: Uh, no.
MusicNeutron: Then who is it?
MusicNeutron: Who are you on last.fm?
Norichan822: See, I'm telling you your paranoia is getting to you.
Norichan822: I'm not on Last.FM, per se.
Norichan822: You're not going to find out my identity like this.
MusicNeutron: Is it Hairmetaladdict?
MusicNeutron: TimSkinner?
Norichan822: Nope, and nope.
Norichan822: As I said, I don't use Last.FM.
Norichan822: I use Pandora.
MusicNeutron: Okay
MusicNeutron: Who are you on DA then?
Norichan822: I was RevengeoftheSeaweed.
MusicNeutron: Never heard of you.
Norichan822: Exactly.
Norichan822: I told you.
Norichan822: You do not know me and this s the first time I have contacted you ever.
Norichan822: But I have observed you.
MusicNeutron: Okay
MusicNeutron: Oh really?
Norichan822: Yeah, really.
MusicNeutron: First, tell me what you did to really get my AIM handle and where you got it from.
Norichan822: Your ED page.
Norichan822: It's in the Talk section.
MusicNeutron: Who the hell posted that?\
Norichan822: I told you I was an internet detective.
MusicNeutron: I don't even have that listed anywhere!
Norichan822: Well, evidently, somebody found out.
Norichan822: Either that, or you're lying.
Norichan822: You must have posted it somewhere to someone.
MusicNeutron: Who on ED listed it?
Norichan822: I don't recall.
Norichan822: nevertheless, somebody found it, otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation.
Norichan822: A logical deduction, no?
MusicNeutron: Whatever let's get to the point. What do you want?
Norichan822: To ask some questions.
Norichan822: Is that all right with you?
MusicNeutron: Okay
Norichan822: Good.
Norichan822: Now, what's up with this Shadow Blaziken character?
MusicNeutron: She won't stop ridiculing me, she doesn't care that I'm handicapped, and she treats it like a big joke.
Norichan822: You're handicapped?
MusicNeutron: Yes.
Norichan822: Howso?
MusicNeutron: I have aspergers
MusicNeutron: And OCD.
Norichan822: ... And how are you handicapped?
MusicNeutron: Isn't that a way of being handicapped? Aspergers?
Norichan822: Not really.
MusicNeutron: Whatever
Norichan822: Not unless you decide to use it as a crutch to garner sympathy.
MusicNeutron: She doesn't give a shit that I have a hard time getting around when it comes to certain things, and I had to get my cousin who's staying with me to tell her off since I'm apparently not doing a good job at it.
MusicNeutron: And she thinks it's me.
Norichan822: Your cousin?
MusicNeutron: Yeah
MusicNeutron: My cousin!
Norichan822: I hate to play the Devil'S Advocate, bu that sounds suspect.
MusicNeutron: Why?
MusicNeutron: Why does everybody think that somebody else who defends me is just me under an alternate account?
Norichan822: like, your cousin just HAPPENS to care about your online life enough to defend you from her.
MusicNeutron: No
Norichan822: Well, look at it from the other way around.
MusicNeutron: My cousin's ony on the web at night.
Norichan822: If you're harassing someone, and then someone who types very much like the person you're harassing comes to their defense, adamantly insisting they are not the person they're defending...
Norichan822: Doesn't that seem odd?
MusicNeutron: How is the way I type not common? Alot of people type the way I do!
MusicNeutron: It's a common way of typing!
Norichan822: There's a certain tone in the writing that can be detected.
MusicNeutron: How so?
Norichan822: I took some creative writing classes, it's just the way someone writes certain words and phrases...
Norichan822: Like, the wording of something.
Norichan822: It's difficult to explain.
MusicNeutron: Well I guess it's just a coincidence then.
Norichan822: Well, can you see why somebody would think that?
MusicNeutron: Maybe
Norichan822: I mean, it's the internet, it's very easy to lie about such things.
Norichan822: And, it's done often.
Norichan822: I've seen it.
MusicNeutron: Whatever
MusicNeutron: Next question
Norichan822: Somebody says something stupid, and to save face, they say their younger brother or sister is the one that really typed it.
Norichan822: Very well.
Norichan822: What does she ridicule you about?
MusicNeutron: My opinions
MusicNeutron: On things I like.
Norichan822: On?
Norichan822: Such as?
MusicNeutron: I don't consider certain artists to be classified under genres that they're usually labeled under.
MusicNeutron: And she won't leave me alone!
MusicNeutron: I had to block her ass!
MusicNeutron: And I had to turn off my shoutbox!
Norichan822: Well, labels exist for a reason.
MusicNeutron: Labels have nothing to do with it.
Norichan822: In music, ys.
Norichan822: yes*
Norichan822: I happen to consider myself an avid music fan.
MusicNeutron: I just have a different opinion on certain artists' genres, and she doesn't respect it.
Norichan822: Classification is important.
Norichan822: Well, your opinion on what the artist's genre is doesn't matter.
Norichan822: The artist's opinion on wat their genre is does.
Norichan822: You could say that a band is any genre you want, but if the artist says otherwise, you're wrong.
MusicNeutron: Yeah
Norichan822: you're agreeing with me, but are you really processing this?
MusicNeutron: But I haven't heard an artist that I consider to be under a different genre say that they're the genre they usually get classified under.
Norichan822: Mayvbe she has evidence to back up her claims?
Norichan822: oH, YOU HAVEN'T?
MusicNeutron: No.
Norichan822: Bleh, capslock.
MusicNeutron: I haven't.
Norichan822: What about Soundgarden?
MusicNeutron: What about them?
Norichan822: They're grunge.
MusicNeutron: Okay
MusicNeutron: Well I don't agree.
Norichan822: I think you know this.
Norichan822: Well, you're wrong.
Norichan822: Chris Cornell would say you're wrong.
MusicNeutron: Yeah, I heard that.
MusicNeutron: But look at Motorhead!
Norichan822: The man practically invented grunge with Mother Love Bone.
MusicNeutron: Lemmy Kilmister says that they aren't a metal band, but everybody else says they are.
Norichan822: Lemmy's right, then.
MusicNeutron: But still
Norichan822: End of story.
MusicNeutron: People keep saying they're metal
Norichan822: His band.
MusicNeutron: Yeah
Norichan822: He should know.
MusicNeutron: I know
Norichan822: Then shut up.
MusicNeutron: But I'm talking about what everyone else says.
Norichan822: Everyone else is retarded.
Norichan822: they're sheep.
MusicNeutron: Okay.
Norichan822: SPIN says Dahsbpoard Confessional is emo.
Norichan822: Emo died in 1995.
MusicNeutron: Okay
MusicNeutron: I get the idea.
Norichan822: Circle Takes the Square was Emo.
Norichan822: Yes.
Norichan822: Chris Cornell says Soundgarden was grunge, they're gunrge, whether you like it or not.
MusicNeutron: Okay
Norichan822: Accept it
MusicNeutron: I believe you
MusicNeutron: Geez
Norichan822: It's okay to like them.
MusicNeutron: Alright
Norichan822: Why do you hate grunge so much anyway?
MusicNeutron: The lyrical content for the most part.
Norichan822: Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney were great bands.
Norichan822: Lyrical content?
MusicNeutron: They usually just whine about how miserable their lives are.
MusicNeutron: Doing a ballad is one thing
MusicNeutron: But when all your songs are just you whining like a panzy.
MusicNeutron: That's a problem.
Norichan822: Alice in Chains doesn't really whine.
MusicNeutron: Okay
Norichan822: Pearl Jam doesn't whine.
Norichan822: Dinosaur Jr doesn't whine.
Norichan822: Mudhoney doesn't whie.
Norichan822: Whine*
MusicNeutron: Okay
Norichan822: Nirvana didn't whine.
MusicNeutron: Oh, they didn't?
Norichan822: Nope.
Norichan822: I should know.
Norichan822: I own several albums.
Norichan822: mostly screaming.
Norichan822: Not whining.
Norichan822: but since I doubt you listen to them, you wouldn't know.
MusicNeutron: Nirvana overall is just downright depressing. I've heard their stuff on the radio alot.
MusicNeutron: And it wasn't just one or two songs.
Norichan822: Radio singles suck.
Norichan822: This is a cardinal rle of most good music ever.
Norichan822: rule*
MusicNeutron: I'm pretty sure they've played non-single stuff too.
Norichan822: if it's on the radio, it's a single.
Norichan822: Duh.
MusicNeutron: Pink Floyd's "Young Lust" was never a single, and I hear that on the radio sometimes.
Norichan822: Sometimes.
MusicNeutron: Exactly, that's the point.
Norichan822: But, you can't judge a band by one or two songs.
MusicNeutron: Not every song played on the radio was released as a single.
Norichan822: Whih is exact;y what you are doing.
Norichan822: You aught to be ashamed.
MusicNeutron: What am I doing?
Norichan822: Judging a band by one or two songs.
MusicNeutron: No I'm not!
Norichan822: Yes.
MusicNeutron: I'm just saying:
Norichan822: You said so yourself.
MusicNeutron: That just because you hear a song on the radio doesn't mean it was ever released as a single.
Norichan822: You said you'd only heard one or two Nirvana songs.
MusicNeutron: No I didn't.
MusicNeutron: I said I didn't hear just one or two songs.
Norichan822: Yes, you did.
Norichan822: Scroll up.
Norichan822: Nirvana had many, many singles.
MusicNeutron: Okay
Norichan822: It's okay to not like them, but you seem to have a hate boner for them.
MusicNeutron: How do I know ALL of the songs I've heard them play of theirs on the radio were released as a single?
Norichan822: Assume so.
MusicNeutron: Whatever.
MusicNeutron: I just don't like them, okay?
Norichan822: That's fine and all...
Norichan822: But you seem to have a raging hate-boner for them.
Norichan822: Which boggles my mind to no end.
Norichan822: I'm simply trying to figure out why that is.
MusicNeutron: I feel that they took fun away from rock music.
Norichan822: I feel that hir metal took away the substance from rock music and turned it all into vapid glitz and glamor, taking away it's power.
Norichan822: Nirvana brought it back.
MusicNeutron: How? Just because of the clothes?
Norichan822: And the make-up.
Norichan822: And the hair.
Norichan822: And the sex.
Norichan822: And the drugs.
MusicNeutron: You're just judging it on appearance?
MusicNeutron: Remember the old saying:
Norichan822: That's all hair metal was.
MusicNeutron: Never judge a book by its cover.
Norichan822: Appearence.
Norichan822: That's exactly it.
MusicNeutron: No, there were alot of talented musicians in those bands.
Norichan822: Those bands had no real impact beyond appearence.
Norichan822: I mean, on music in general.
MusicNeutron: And you're acting as if they still dress like that.
MusicNeutron: I don't care about the clothes.
Norichan822: They're gone.
MusicNeutron: It's the MUSIC that matters.
Norichan822: The music is dead.
Norichan822: Hair Metal was the most vapid, self-centered, wanktastic, masturbatory msuci ever invented.
Norichan822: music*
Norichan822: How was it art?
MusicNeutron: It was fun.
MusicNeutron: It makes me feel good.
MusicNeutron: It makes me happy
Norichan822: About yourself.
Norichan822: See?
Norichan822: masturbatory.
MusicNeutron: And doesn't make me all depressed or anything.
MusicNeutron: No
Norichan822: Yeds.
MusicNeutron: Masturbation has nothing to do with it.
Norichan822: Yes.*
Norichan822: it has everything to do with it.
MusicNeutron: How?
Norichan822: Just like self-help books.
MusicNeutron: This makes no sense.
Norichan822: Masturbation of the soul.
Norichan822: that's what it is.
Norichan822: It's all about good times and partying.
Norichan822: Self-centered, pety shit.
MusicNeutron: So? There are songs from the 50's like that.
MusicNeutron: and the 60's and 70's.
Norichan822: You're making a mistake.
MusicNeutron: About partying.
MusicNeutron: Good times
MusicNeutron: Having fun
MusicNeutron: Enjoying life
Norichan822: You're assuming that Hair Meta was the omly music the 80's produced.
MusicNeutron: No
MusicNeutron: I'm not
Norichan822: Sorry, I listened to hard Core punk.
MusicNeutron: I'm just trying to explain something.
Norichan822: Music about society and social change.
Norichan822: About emotion and poetry.
Norichan822: Not about licking whipped crasm off of a sixteen year old girl's boobs.
Norichan822: cream*
MusicNeutron: It's just a song. I don't think they'd do that in real life.
MusicNeutron: Geez
Norichan822: O RLY?
Norichan822: The problem is, you get too into music like that, you lose touch of stuff that matters.
Norichan822: They're not even clever songs about partying.
MusicNeutron: No I don't. I'm very neclectic in my musical taste. I like stuff from all eras.
MusicNeutron: 50's
MusicNeutron: 60's
MusicNeutron: 70's
Norichan822: They're generic and bland.
MusicNeutron: 80's
MusicNeutron: 90's
MusicNeutron: today
MusicNeutron: But alot of today's stuff I don't like.
Norichan822: So do i.
MusicNeutron: And my preferred decade is the 80's
Norichan822: Your point being?
MusicNeutron: And that's it.
Norichan822: Uh-huh.
Norichan822: You're missing my point.
Norichan822: I too, listen to a lot of 80's music, but I hate hair metal.
MusicNeutron: Well, I try to respect other people's opinions.
MusicNeutron: But I don't be an asshole to them unless they be an asshole to me.
Norichan822: I like 70's music, but I hate arena rock.
MusicNeutron: Okay
MusicNeutron: But like I said:
Norichan822: And yet, arena rock and hair metal seems to be the bulk of what you like.
MusicNeutron: So?
Norichan822: I'm just saying...
MusicNeutron: I like the sound of it.
Norichan822: Isn't that a little odd, if you think about it?
MusicNeutron: The instruments
Norichan822: What's your favorite avant-garde band?
MusicNeutron: Geez, isn't anybody entitled to their own opinions anymore in this day and age? I guess not.
Norichan822: Opinions should be well-founded.
MusicNeutron: avant-garde? What do you mean? People with aspergers people have a hard-time understanding certain things.
Norichan822: Avant-garde.
Norichan822: Artsy stuff. Off-the-wall music.
MusicNeutron: In other words?
MusicNeutron: Oh
MusicNeutron: Lots
MusicNeutron: Queensryche
Norichan822: Such as?
MusicNeutron: Pink Floyd
Norichan822: ...
MusicNeutron: Uh, what else:
Norichan822: They're not Avant-Garde.
MusicNeutron: They experiment
MusicNeutron: They've made rock operas
Norichan822: That's not avant-garde.
Norichan822: You think that's experimenting?
MusicNeutron: Then name me some examples of avant garde then.
Norichan822: Try making an entire opera album with no actual words: only gibberish.
Norichan822: Try making an album deconstruting popular songs from the sixties.
MusicNeutron: If you're talking about regular opera with people who sing really high.
Norichan822: No.
Norichan822: I'm talking NOT AN ACTUAL LANGUAGE.
Norichan822: I MEAN, ACTUAL GIBBERISH.
MusicNeutron: That would be weird.
Norichan822: it's been done.
MusicNeutron: Like that stuff in the first Sims game.
Norichan822: The album I was referring to is The resident's "Eskimo."
Norichan822: It was released in around 1980.
Norichan822: It was consdered for a grammy.
MusicNeutron: Hmmmm
Norichan822: The residents have revolutionized music in more ways than you could imagine.
MusicNeutron: Okay
Norichan822: And you probably never even heard of them.
MusicNeutron: Well hey, I can't help it if Aspergers don't do or like certain things that most normal people do.
Norichan822: They invented the music video. they pioneered interactive CDs.
Norichan822: STOP SAYING YOU HAVE ASPERGERS.
MusicNeutron: ?
MusicNeutron: But I do.
Norichan822: THAT IS NOT AN EXCUSE.
Norichan822: NO.
Norichan822: STOP IT.
Norichan822: NO WONDER YOU'RE BEING MADE FUN OF.
Norichan822: YOU KEEP LEANING ON ASPERGERS AS A CRUTCH/
Norichan822: STOP IT.
MusicNeutron: The only place on last.fm that I had aspergers was in this dude's shoutbox.
MusicNeutron: And that's it
Norichan822: it's not Aspergers. You're just uneducated.
MusicNeutron: I didn't mention it anywhere else.
Norichan822: You've mentioned it multiple times in this IM conversation alone.
MusicNeutron: I've been in special ed classes my whole life except for 8th grade.
Norichan822: And I was in special ed preschool and kindergarten because my parents thought I had autism.
Norichan822: Boo-fucking-hoo.
MusicNeutron: No
Norichan822: Stop it.
MusicNeutron: I mean not just those
MusicNeutron: But middle and High School too.
Norichan822: I know.
Norichan822: Shut up about it.
Norichan822: It's not an excuse for the fact that you're uneducated.
MusicNeutron: How so?
Norichan822: Aspergers does not make you retarded, so stop using it as an excuse for being retarded.
MusicNeutron: I never said it did.
Norichan822: You practically are
MusicNeutron: I said that somethings are hard to understand or figure out.
Norichan822: IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THEY AREN'T.
MusicNeutron: If I was retarded, I wouldn't be able to speak to you properly.
Norichan822: Jesus Christ, I thought Asperger's kids were supposed to be brilliant.
Norichan822: Like people with Autism.
MusicNeutron: Here, maybe this will explain better:
MusicNeutron: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergers
Norichan822: You, on the other hand, use Aspergers as an excuse to not think about anything.
Norichan822: I KNOW FUCKING WELL WHAT IT IS.
MusicNeutron: Alright
MusicNeutron: Geez
Norichan822: DO NOT FUCKING PATRONIZE ME.
MusicNeutron: Okay
Norichan822: Good.
Norichan822: Because unlike you, i don't make excuses for myself.
Norichan822: I have ADD, but I still am reading and comprehending what you're saying.
MusicNeutron: Okay
MusicNeutron: So I don't know about certain artists most other people do. Why make a big deal out of it?
Norichan822: Because it shows you're musically uneducated.
MusicNeutron: Don't blame me. Blame the idiots who handled my classes or whatever in middle and high school.
MusicNeutron: I'm very hyper active
Norichan822: They wouldn't teach you about that, stupid.
MusicNeutron: I like to mimic people and things
Norichan822: That's shit you have to take t upon yourself to learn.
Norichan822: And stop blaming everybody else for your problems.
Norichan822: Or is that another symptom of Apsergers? Dodging responsibilty?
Norichan822: Shit, I can do that on my own without that.
MusicNeutron: Geez, why is it that everytime I try to back up a statement, it's always taken out of context?
Norichan822: You're so used to blaiming your teachers for not being able to handle your own behavior, or blaming your so-called "handicap."
Norichan822: because i'm reading between the lines.
MusicNeutron: Okay, apparently, I'm not doing a very good job at explaining myself. Why don't you ask my mother. She'll explain it better than I can, but she's sleeping right now. It's almost 3 in the fucking morning.
Norichan822: Because I aced the SATs for reading fo comprehension.
Norichan822: I don't want to talk to your mother.
MusicNeutron: Well you'll have to, because apparently, I can't explain myself.
Norichan822: I doubt she would explain it any better than you could/
Norichan822: You're just lazy.
MusicNeutron: How so?
MusicNeutron: No
Norichan822: yes.
MusicNeutron: I'm trying to explain
MusicNeutron: But you don't understand
Norichan822: You blame your lack of understanding on your condition.
Norichan822: That's lazy.
Norichan822: No wonder Shadow Blaziken makes fun of you.
Norichan822: You set yourself up as a victim.
MusicNeutron: Why? Because my opinions on some things are different?
Norichan822: All she's doing is giving into the temptation.
Norichan822: because you're practically setting yourself up.
Norichan822: And you just refuse to get it.
MusicNeutron: My opinions are setting myself up. Okay, this isn't making any sense.
Norichan822: It's mainly the fact that you refuse to understand things that aren't convient for you.
MusicNeutron: Such as?
Norichan822: That sets yourself up to be made fun of.
Norichan822: When i was teling you earlier that Soundgarden is grunge.
MusicNeutron: Okay
Norichan822: I had to practically bash you over the head to explain that they were, indeed, gunrge.
Norichan822: grunge*
Norichan822: Because you hate grunge so much, it doesn't fit in your reality that a band you like should be grunge.
MusicNeutron: Okay
MusicNeutron: FINE
Norichan822: If I start saying things that you can't follow, you bring up Aspergers as an excuse.
MusicNeutron: Maybe I don't hate ALL of grunge.
MusicNeutron: But I do hate much of it.
Norichan822: Have you ever even listened to Mudhoney?
MusicNeutron: They were in that movie Black Sheep.
MusicNeutron: They did one tune
Norichan822: And?
MusicNeutron: But that's all I ever heard
MusicNeutron: Sounded like an okay tune.
Norichan822: What about Dinosaur Jr?
MusicNeutron: Yeah
Norichan822: You like them?
MusicNeutron: Yeah
Norichan822: Mudhoney and Dinosaur Jr. are grunge.
MusicNeutron: O
Norichan822: yeah.
MusicNeutron: I've heard Mudhoney get called grunge, but not Dinosaur.
MusicNeutron: Alternative Rock, yes
Norichan822: Dinosaur is grunge.
MusicNeutron: But I've never heard anyone call them grunge.
Norichan822: They are. their early stuff is, anyway.
MusicNeutron: Except for one person.
Norichan822: Me?
MusicNeutron: No
MusicNeutron: Some guy named Toaster Kun
MusicNeutron: Another troll.
Norichan822: Well, you just set yourself up for trolling, and then you seem baffled as to why you're being trolled.
MusicNeutron: Well maybe I just can't understand why these bands get put under the genres they usually get put under.
Norichan822: Well, then.
MusicNeutron: Besides, not everyone will agree with the masses.
Norichan822: That's your own lack of understanding at work.
Norichan822: Perhaps if you did some research, you'd understand.
MusicNeutron: What kind of research?
Norichan822: Internet detective work.
MusicNeutron: Whatever.
Norichan822: You want to know how to not get trolled?
MusicNeutron: Yeah
MusicNeutron: Of course
Norichan822: 1. Don't block people.
Norichan822: That's a sign of weakness.
MusicNeutron: I don't block people unless they really get to me.
Norichan822: That also sends a signal that the trolling is working.
Norichan822: And that you're caving into the pressure they're putting on you.
MusicNeutron: So what are you saying? I should just let them fill my shoutboxes and stuff up with shit I don't wanna hear?
Norichan822: You block someone, or delete their comments, that's as good as admitting defeat.
Norichan822: Yes.
Norichan822: Because it'll show that you can take it.
MusicNeutron: No
Norichan822: That you're a man.
MusicNeutron: I just don't want to put up with it.
MusicNeutron: I'm trying to be a man of peace.
Norichan822: that you're not a pussy that hides things he doesn't want to hear.
MusicNeutron: And they just add fuel to the fire.
Norichan822: Just leave it there and ignoreit.
Norichan822: Don't react. At all.
Norichan822: Not hiding, deleting, nothing.
Norichan822: just leave it and ignore it.
Norichan822: If you don't react at all, they get bored and go away.
Norichan822: By hiding, deleting, or blocking people, you give them fuel to their fire.
Norichan822: You practically goad them on.
MusicNeutron: Is that so.
Norichan822: Yes.
Norichan822: I know this for a fact.
MusicNeutron: Well what if that has nothing to do with it? What if I just don't want people posting stuff like that in my shoutbox?
Norichan822: Who the fuck cares?
Norichan822: What's the big fucking deal? It's a fucking shoutbox.

MusicNeutron: That's their opinion
MusicNeutron: Not a fact.
Norichan822: Then why did you state that The Wall is the best album ever like it's a fact?
Norichan822: Why not just say it's your favorite album?
MusicNeutron: I was just giving my opinion. I was just saying that I THINK it's the greatest album of all time.
MusicNeutron: I wasn't like, like:
MusicNeutron: Ihhh
MusicNeutron: *Uhhhh
MusicNeutron: This is the greatest album of all time, and if you don't like it, fuck u!
