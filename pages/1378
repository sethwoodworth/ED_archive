Catherine Deveny

From time to time, the decadent and depraved Australian public turn from savage bigots into angelic puritans. Such as when a "[[bullshit|national icon]]", the late [[Steve Irwin]]'s daughter, Bindi, is mentioned in the same sentence as "getting laid". Enter '''Catherine Deveny''', some unheard of Australian comedian who was invited to the Logies (like the Golden Globes, but non-notable and more rigged - seriously) and decided to give a blow-by-blow account of the event on [[Twitter]].

As usual, the Australian public's selective hearing was tuned into the [[Atheist]] comedian, and boy did she slip up (apparently). The newspaper she writes for fired her, bowing to the pressure of the wowser public.

[[Haters gonna hate]].

{{quote|I do hope Bindi Irwin gets laid #logies}}

Well, she is [[loli|only 11]] or something, but who can stand such an annoying little [[cunt]]? Bindi is riding on the coat-tails of [[Steve Irwin|her dead ecological-terrorist father]], and is fueled by her mother's insatiable appetite for more money and fame.

Bindi's comments [[Shit no one cares about|were not heard]] in the aftermath, presumably because she's a mere puppet of her media handlers, not a free-thinking, individual little snow flake.

|Catherine who??? She is a nobody who obviously gets off directing cruel comments towards others. A DISGRACE.
|
|Catherine who? WHAT THE !!!!!!!!!!
|[[You]]
|Typical female comedian. Trying ever so hard to be both funny and successful.
|Richard Pryor, telling her to get back to the kitchen
|absolutely disgusting.... i get that your a comedian but [[Engrish|YOUR]] NOT FUNNY... making fun about molestation and paedophelia about an 11 year is disgusting... your low ... and i think making fun of someone dying of breast cancer is disgusting..... i could care less that there "celebrities" but the content of those jokes were not funny and i hope you feel ashamed of yourself!!!!
|
|Oh you're a comedian (LOL)....never heard of you loser. Such disgusting and vile comments made about a young girl...Grow up you immature ridiculous woman.
|
|She's a comedian? This gutter trash isn't funny. She fails as a comedian IMO. [[Ugly]] too.
|
|Absalutely disgusting! How a person can be so bitter (Comedian or not) I do not know! To write such loathing and derogatory comments, especially about an 11 year old and a persons deceased partner, I do not know. I feel sorry for you Deveny. You should be ashamed!
|
|this woman is seriously disturbed.
|
|Perhaps Catherine Deveny should actually use her brains and THINK before she uses Twitter to degrade and offend other people! Her comments about Bindi Irwin, a little girl who lost her beloved Dad, are offensive, as well as her nasty and uncalled for comment about Tasma Walton!!
|
|Whats funny about hoping an 11-yr old has sex? Its illegal Deveny!! Your vile and disgusting. Sounds more like your the one who's the joke not your pathetic comments. Use to be a fan - glad I'm not anymore.
|
|Sarcasm and witticism are fine but out and out cruelty like the comments regarding Bindi and Rove are way below the belt. Especially making sexual comments about a child. I used to like reading Deveny's column. Not anymore!

Nobody gives a fuck. Go home and be offended in privacy. Cry yourself to sleep that you wasted so much money buying TV Weeks so you could vote your crappy pseudo-celebrity, and I hope you choke a bit knowing that you ROBBED Shaun Micallef of some recognition.<br /><br />

The recent outrage over Deveny's twitter comments is not her first brush with [[lulz|controversy]]. In 2007 she made some [[whore|revealing]] comments in defense of adultery.

{{quote|It's easy to forget that we're just mammals wearing clothes. I'm always reminded when the spring racing carnival comes around of the primal urge we have as animals to [[sex|procreate]].|Deveny}}

{{quote|Lifelong monogamy is an unrealistic expectation that makes people feel like [[fail|failures]]... People are torn between their emotions and an archaic expectation that was conceived when the average life expectancy was 30. Monogamy is a wonderful way to maintain what the church and the state would call "social order" and, more importantly, to ensure paternity to hand wealth down to offspring.

Things are different now.|Deveny}}
