== Origination ==
Happycat is one of the older [[SA]] [[memes]], dating back to early 2003 when it was discovered by Fancycat and a truckload of other [[goons]], launching it into meme status by posting it and Photoshopping it all over the fucking place. The [[cat]] itself is a British Shorthair with an amusing grin, thus receiving the dub of Happycat. It was used by a [[Russian]] cat food company as a mascot, but apparently it was a shitty choice because they've been out of business for [[at least 100 years]]. It managed to surpass the more-bannable Fiestacat in popularity, but even now Happycat is usually bannable because goons mostly deny the existence of their own memes. He made a slight comeback when a goon with a spare $1000 decided to make an ad in the LA Times involving the cat of happy.

== The YTMND Era ==
Although Happycat has ran his course on SA, [[YTMND]] has adopted him as their next giant meme. Years ago, when a video on [[Ogrish]] was found showing a cat in a box being torched, YTMND white-knighted their way to the top to get the video and creator destroyed, while ignoring the other less-important videos of human torture and death. Along the lines someone made a YTMND site featuring a play-by-play of the video, complete with [[Doom]] music in the background. An outraged catlady claimed that not even Doom music made this funny. [[NEDM]]. Thus, the new YTMND flavor of the month was born. Various cats were used in sites, but once the [[exploitable]] Happycat entered the arena, it was a whole new fad. Happycat is now the official NEDM mascot to this day, with the theme 'We Interrupt this Program' by Coburn. Chap stick is somehow involved

== Rude Kitty ==
On Myspace, someone attempted to profit off of Happycat with the Rude Kitty line of [[crap]]. It involved slapping Happycat on shirts, bags, stickers, and other things with captions worthy of [[Gaia]]. Once found, YTMND rushed to the scene once again and managed to get Rude Kitty off the face of the earth. It was a time of grief for Happycat, but he pulled through with help from his gay husband [[that_fucking_cat|Tom]].

== 4Chan ==
Like any other cat, Happycat will usually show up on [[Caturday]] or any other thread about cats. He shares his stardom with friends [[Longcat]], [[Limecat]], [[Speedycat]], [[Ceilingcat]], [[Zippocat]], and the other cats with numbers totaling [[over 9000]]

== Everywhere else ==

For some reason, people thought slapping the phrase [[I can has cheeseburger|I CAN HAS CHEESEBURGER?]] on Happycat was comedy gold, when in reality, is a load of comedy [[Unfunny|pyrite]] at the least. With [http://lolcats.com/ Lolcats] gaining notoriety, we can only hope the general populace doesn't destroy Happycat, lest he ends up losing meme status to [http://icanhascheezburger.com/tag/happycat/ fags] who act like they're the first ever to find it

== Destruction of Happycat ==
[[MySpace]], the much hated social networking website populated by [[emos]] and [[fags]] is soon to be invaded by [[newfags]] all thanks to Tom Anderson's idea to incorporate Happycat into his shitty excuse for a social life.
