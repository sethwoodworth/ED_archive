[[Image:Wikinazi.gif|100px|right]]
The '''Wikipediametric''' mailing list, also known as the '''Eastern European Mailing List''', is an internet brigade of fascist [[Eurotrash]] [[TOW|Wikipedo]] [[faggot]]s butthurt over Communism (which Wikipedia is). A guild in the MMORPG that is Wikipedia, this cabal went around injecting their ethno-fascist right wing rhetoric into Eastern Europe related subjects through such tactics as coordinated revert warring and stalking, harassment and trolling on their enemies until eventually, they got [[pwnage|leaked their email archives]] at [[Wikileaks]]. The faggots immediately started crying. The brigade was sued in Wikicourt, resulting in a very lulzy and delicious protracted court circus. After weakish [[Unrealistic Expectations|temporary]] topic bans, most are already back in action.

==Background==
The WPM email list was a secret cabal where users called on their fuck buddies for [[blackup]]. Typically, one [[cabal]] member picks an [[edit war]] on their enemies, and sends their [[spam]] to the mailing list to call for backup. Then, all the cabal members come and edit war, making one or two reverts each. The cabal then concentrates [[stalking]], [[harassment]] against their enemies until said enemy is provoked into lashing out. Then the cabal orchestrates a ban against said enemy by using some [[Wikipedia:User:Sandstein|Wikipedo admin used as their fuck puppet]]. Rinse and repeat. One particular user who fell a victim was the hated [[wikipedia:user:Russavia|user:Russavia]], some random [[Wikipedo]] over half the mails are about.

The EEML web brigade consists largely of Estonian or Poland nationalists. Estonia is a shitty little country no one cares about that was pwnt by the Soviets in World War II. Putin could have pwnt this little shithole without lifting his finger. As such, the web brigade is butthurt over all Russian and Communist subjects. It is also where Estonian [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crime_in_Estonia&diff=prev&oldid=296310464 pedophiles] like the EEML users live, and they suppress anyone who points out the truth. Similarly, Poland is a filthy poisonous swamp in Russia pwnt by the Nazis. This web brigade does not want you to know that.

Such lulzy methods have been used by people like [[Grawp]] on 4chan, only this is worse because it is being used to promote [[fascism]].

Like Scientologists, the users find any possible way to harass and attack their content opponents and anyone who gets in their way.

Other methods included taking a book out of the [[Wikipedia Jews]]' [[talmud]], by electing their own [[CheckUser]]s and admins to push their agenda. The members also maintain a long list of sockpuppets to help with their warring. One user even donated socks to a banned user.

The list is hosted on the aptly named "Wiki[[pedo]]meter" site. The list members regularly have [[Lemonparty|Lemonparties]].

==What Happened==
Piotr Micula aka [[Wikipedia:User:Tymek|User:Tymek]] had posted his Wikipedia account password to the mailing list for other mailing list members to use. Someone logged into his Wikipedia account and used the [[Special:EmailUser]] function to send a link to an archive of the list hosted on [[Wikileaks]] to nine administrators. The Arbcommies believe that one of the list's own memebers team-killed them, while the brigade maintains that they were hacked. Three of the admins were [[Wikipedia:User:Jehochman|User:Jehochman]], [[Wikipedia:User:Alex Bakharev|User:Alex Bakharev]], and [[Wikipedia:User:Future Perfect at Sunrise|User:Future Perfect at Sunrise]]. By leaking in this manner the mole had ensured maximum drama as the mailing list participants would start pointing the finger at each other, at least one of the nine admins would make the archive public, and Wikipedia was free set up an [[Internet Court]] case on this as the leaking was done on Wikipedia servers. Bravo, well played sir!

As a result, Wikipedo user [[Piotrus]] had his adminship revoked. The members still maintain that everyone except themselves are paid editors of the Russian state, and still cry buckets about how unfair the world is to them, not realizing that Wikipedia is no place for faggot fascist fucks like themselves.

==Fascist crybaby Vecrumba is trolled by ED==
[[User:Bantustan|Bantustan]], an ED user came over to TOW for the lulz and actually [[Irony|ended up getting one of the Wikipedos banned]].

{{quote3|'''Bantustan''': Greetings Wikipedians, Poeticbent mentioned me above but I wanted to assure you that I'm not part of Wikipedia's Russian cabal. I speak for myself but I have no animosity towards the mailing list members and I am grateful for the lulz. I've never even had a Wikipedia account. Looking at what has happened I'm really surprised that volunteers who've contributed such a large portion of their time to such a project would be treated with such utter contempt by said project. Why would anyone want to continue to contribute to such a project when they are outed by said project and forced to participate in an internet court circus?

'''Radek''': Greetings, you are absolutely right, its surprising that we have to hear common sense from someone from ED. This project is really going downhill.

'''Alexia Death''': Hi Bantustan, I can has your babeez? Fat girls need lovin' too. To answer your question, one wouldn't want to contribute.

'''Vecrumba''': Greetings from the bawwwer, why would anyone want to participate in a website that attacks people you don't know with the [[Lulz|vilest of slander]]! I know who you are and where you work. Your first name is xxx your wife's first name is xxx and your mother and mine have an irma connection. Your credit card number is xxxxxxxx. Also, my mother can beat up your mother. 

'''Russavia''': Vecrumba, you shouldn't have done that. Even if that user is an IP user you've violated WP:OUTING.

'''Vecrumba''': Give me a break! Go ahead and blame the victim. I don't appreciate being called a "Fascist Eurotrash Faggot". My parents were pwnt by the Russians and I need revenge against you pigs.

'''Russavia''' to '''Knights Lago''': Knights Lago, please block Vecrumba he has violated WP:OUTING

'''Knights Lago''' to '''Vecrumba''': Banhammer time!

'''Manning''': And in addition to the 3 day Ban from Wikipedia, you are banned for a week from the arbcom page. To be served consecutively.

'''Vecrumba''': Unblock me pleez, you communist pigz!!!!. How much did the Russians pay you for that, Knights Lago? '''''<u>I'm using bold, italics and underline!!!! Wahhhh!!!![[oneone|1!11]]</u>'''''

'''Lankiveil''': No way faggot, you are blocked.

'''Future Perfect at Sunrise''': Vecrumba you idiot, did you really think that was his real personal info?

'''Sandstein''': WTF just happened.

'''Future Perfect at Sunrise''': PM me if you want details on the lulz, Sandstein.

'''Sandstein''': No thanks, I'm too busy banning Wikipedia regulars while [[Fag|autofelating]] myself.

'''Future Perfect at Sunrise''': But Sandstein, baby, I want to [[Fag|autofelate]] myself with you!}}

==Radeksz: Dumb [[Poland|Polack]]==
[[image:Meanwhile in Poland.jpg|thumb|left]]
[[Wikipediametric/Radeksz|'''View The Oversighted Content Here''']]
[[image:RadekAccidentally2.jpg|thumb|right]]

Just when Arbcom was about to let most of the mailing listers go scott free and amid accusations that the EEML is still active, Radek Szulga [[I accidentally X|'''accidentally copied and pasted the entire screen from inside his Gmail account''']] onto an Wikipedia article whilst proxying for a banned user by copying text he sent in an email. The content of the post was oversighted. The relevant parts of the edit is reproduced at [[Wikipediametric/Radeksz|this subpage]] for your pleasure.

The hated [[Communist|Russavia]] was [[Anti-lulz|blocked for one week]] by the Wikipedos because he [[lollercaust|could not contain his glee]] and linked to the above content.

The delicious [[irony]] is that the mailing list participants complained that their private emails had been released to the public by a mole and yet here they are releasing their own private emails to an even larger public.

==Miscellaneous Drama==
[[wikipedia:User talk:Manning Bartlett|Manning Bartlett]], an incompetent Arbcom clerk who was a TOW user since 2001, banned a sysop for fighting with the lolcow [[Jehochman]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shell_Kinney&diff=prev&oldid=327039499]. As a result, an arbcommie overturned this sudden ban and Bartlett stormed off butthurt.

==So what's the big fucking deal of a mailing list?==
[[Image:Wikitrap.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Web [[wikipedia:Brigadier General|Brigadier General]] Piotrus in cabal uniform]]
[[Image:Piotr Konieczny Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|right|230px|<sub><span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Krokodylczny<font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;"> talk </font></span></sub>]]
Well, nothing. As a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) where you progress through the game by getting your opposing editors blocked and inserting your POV into articles, it is natural that the players would form a guild of like minded editors to push their own POV and get their collective opponents blocked. So Wikipedia is really just a battleground of different warring guilds. However, since all MMORPG's are controlled by [[Zionists]], the only guild/cabal that is allowed on Wikipedia are the [[Wikipedia Jews]]. All other guilds other than the Wikipedia Jews will be [[Kill it with fire|killed with fire]] by the Zionist controlled [[Arbcom|Arbcommies]] and Zionist controlled Wikipedo Administrators. 

This Jewish double-standard was apparent when prominent WikiJew [[Jayjg]]Jew [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-December/087744.html sent out a message that was intended for his Jew Cabal members that accidentally went to the entire WikiEN-l mailing list]. There was no arbcom case about this incident; hardly anyone complained; and Jayjg kept his Admin, Checkuser, and Oversight tools.

So, one wonders why this particular brigade gets harassed by the WikiJews and their allies when all they did was play by the rules? Well, maybe Anti-Nationalist/PasswordUsername is right. Maybe Eastern Europe is filled with Nazi Collaborators who are out to send the Eastern European Jewery to the oven. The mailing lists crybaby, Vecrumba said it himself: ''"The Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. denounces all Balts for complicity in the Holocaust: They knew what was happening."'' [http://lettonica.blogspot.com/2007/04/pters-jnis-vecrumba-interview.html (sauce)]

==Who was the mole?==

It is difficult to determine which of the mailing list members was the mole of the group. One would think that Tymek was the mole as the Wikileaks link to the archive was sent via his Wikipedia account. [[Some Argue|Others argue]] that Piotrus might have been the mole based on his conduct on ED. [[We]] believe that the mole would have been someone who didn't get mentioned by Arbcom, didn't take part in the mailing list shenanigans other than being a member of the mailing list, and didn't get involved with the arbcom case. The only mailing list members that didn't get sanctioned by Arbcom were Alexia Death, Biophys, Ostap R, Poeticbent, and Sander Säde. Out of those members, the only one that didn't really take part in the arbcom case was Ostap R. All the other members would have something to lose with having the mailing list outed. Could Ostap R be the mole? Your guess is as good as ours.

==The court circus concludes==
After months of continual fighting, Arbcom finally concludes, banning most EEML web brigadiers for a year. Now with nowhere to insert their fascist propoganda, the web brigadiers have nothing to do but sit around and wank themselves off to pictures of Mussolini sacrificing babies in Satan's name. Some of the editors "retired", moving on to new sock accounts so they can infiltrate the [[Wikipedia Jews]].
