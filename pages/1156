Breadsona
[[Image:Jew breadsona.gif|thumb|Breadsonae have a strong basis in real life.]]

A Breadsona is the "inner tortured soul" of a Bready, and is used as an avatar in all their online communicae. Inside the heart of each Bready beats the true being of an anthropomorphic bread or sweetcake. A Breadsona is typically much less [[fat|doughy]] than the Bready's real-life body, and often has healthier skin. 2% of [[SomethingAwful]] [[goon]]s are Breadies, and the remaining 98% of goons are closet-Breadies. As such, Breadies are widely considered to be the only [[moron|internet subculture]] that are fatter and greasier than [[Furries]].

Because of the [[gay|otherworldly]] nature of their "alter egos", Breadies can be classified as a sub-species of [[Otherkin]], which is pretty fucking sad but hey, at least they're [[some argue|arguably]] better than [[Otakukin]].

==Typical Activities for a Breadsona==

Breadies are active in the [[online]] [[roleplaying]] scene, generally RP'ing as their Breadsona in places such as [[LiveJournal]] and [[SheezyArt]] (bitches ain't good enough even for [[DeviantArt]]). In fact, Breadies even have their own secret version of [[Furcadia]], called "Breadcadia", that is also created by an ex-[[Ultima online|Origin]] employee, unequivocally proving that not all the people who worked on [[Ultima]] are furries.

However, being that most Breadies are socially impotent [[retard]]s, most Breadsonas are the biggest [[Mary Sue]]s since [[Sonicrocksmysocks]]. This can make for some awesome RP's.

==Breadsona Drama==

Of course, any retarded internet subculture has its drama, and Breadies love to get worked up about their Breadsonas (since it is the representation of one's perfect inner soul, and as such is beyond fault). The biggest dramabomb thrown around the fandom is, as it often is with [[fur]]s and [[otherkin]], the declaration that another's *sona is less than perfectly original. Since almost all Breadsonas are some combination of "fallen angel, half-angel, half-demon, werewolf, vampire, [[wtf|half-vampire]], half-animal, half-dragon, half-[[penis|meat]], etc...", it's [[lie|pretty hard]] for a Bready to create an [[lol|original Breadsona]], unless they wanna go all out and pull a [[SapphyDracases]].

Ah, and it is always worth mentioning that muffins are to Breadsonas what foxes are to [[Fursona]]s.

==Furries aren't the only ones who can do stupid shit to words==

The best Breadsona is considered to be the one with the most Breadsonality, though there are weekly contests held in sekrit IRC to determine which it is. Caution: During these contests, things can get very Breadsonal.
