'''Silken Secret''' is a brand of lube manufactured by [[in the ass|As]]troglide which unintentionally created much [[lulz]] on the [[internets]]. 

In April 2007, a text file containing 4,528 orders for the product was leaked, which included their address, e-mail address, age, gender, and reason for purchase (with reasons usually being "[[centipede-filled vagina|vaginal dryness]]" or "[[anal sex|intimate activity]]"). 

The text file was posted on thegeeklounge.net, and was spammed on [[ED]] [[IRC]] by [[User:Refeniz|Refeniz]].
