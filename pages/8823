Vocational Independence Program
[[File:Vipclassrt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Vocational Independence Program's Class of '09.]]

'''Vocational Independence Program''' ''(AKA '''The VIP''')'' is a fake [[school]] for [[Aspies|losers]] with "learning disabilies", who don't want to be independent after their [[Wikipedia:K–12 (education)|K-12]] school career.  Most retards who survive the [[Special Education|special education program]] develop a loathing for being patronized, and want to get the fuck out of school and be independent. [[You|Others]], however, become totally reliant on the system, and become homeless bums.  Their [[concerned mother|mothers worry about their children]] being burdens on society ''(Too late, [[lol]])'', and so the Vocational Independence Program program was instituted to smooth over the horrible parenting that was inflicted upon their kids. 

The program was first founded at [[Wikipedia:New York Institute of Technology|NYIT]], another Jew college on Long Island that only cares about money, as opposed to actual education, making it the typical second-rate state school at which sluts and [[internet tough guy]]s get their humanities diplomas.  The VIP has served these losers rather miserably over 20 years, as the program itself does not have any sort of separate license or accreditation.

'''[[TL;DR]] Version:''' The Vocational Independence Program is retards teaching retards.

== [http://www.psychologicalandeducationalservices.com/ Stephen Migden] visits VIP! ==
Stephen, an expert on [[You|losers, layabouts, and idiots]] decided to [[troll]] the dirty secrets of VIP.  He met with [[Retarded|Bill Russell]] to discuss the [[Lie|important aspects]] of the VIP program.  Little did he know, the program was an extremely small, pathetic, and the students disrespect their teachers on a regular basis with [[annoying|classic pranks like stink bombs and calling them by their first names]].  An important [[IRL]] [[Intellectual|Ph.D.]] like himself must avoid being an obvious troll or risk his monies, so he obligatorily fakes troll's remorse whilst trolling, preventing [[moralfag]]s from getting uppity.

I did not notice the VIP students interacting with the other, mainstream students on the campus or in the dining hall, [[troll's remorse|although]] in my experience it is not unusual for the students from one program within a university to have little interaction with students from another program.|Stephen Migden, commenting on the properly [[racist|segregated]] structure of the NYIT VIP

|The typical VIP student is between 18 and 22 years old, with an IQ in the 70's.|And you thought this was a joke.}}

Of course, Bill Russell reassured him by pointing out that the VIP students were simply retarded, [[Wikipedia:Spoiled child|spoiled brats]].  Besides refusing to interact with other normal people, these brats have their own food source, a coffee shop, in their fake school so their lack of social skills would not interfere with normal people.

my friend whose a grl w/ high functioning autism and has a lot of speech problems...goes to this program i was just in c. islip...and its a great program...its for kids w/ signifecent ld but sum of my friends friends have adhd(didnt meet them so dont know the extent of there adhd) but most of them are autistic/aspergers its a gr8 program...my friend loves it and everyones guarenteed a single dorm(trust me u need that single its soo small im surprised my friend fit all the stuff she fit in it..and it is a tiny single) the only thing i feel weird about is that her mom is there evry weekend!! i mean it takes 30-45 minutes from my house to the central islip and her mom is further and this was the first time i had been there i hadnt seen her since june..|lesmizzie, A retard defending the VIP program

|VIP has nothing to offer to special needs students. They don't even give them an associate degree. How are they going to lead an independent life?|Mara19, An obvious troll is obvious

|Plenty of people live an independent life without a college degree or AA. NYIT-VIP is not aimed at students who are ready for college. It's aimed at lower-functioning young adults with autism or similar disorders. It (claims to) teach those young adults to become productive members of society. I don't know anything about the program but what I've read on their website, but I do know that there need to be programs like this, for the many autistic young adults who are not yet ready to live independently but who can learn to improve their social, academic and life skills.|Cardinal Fang, Another retard defending the VIP program

|As a former VIP student, I would conclude that it is a bad school for special needs students. The first week of VIP was boring because they don't have any activities scheduled. In the second week, they started doing testing. The testing was part of the process of their track system. Track 2 is the "smart students". Track 1 is the "slow students". The staff at VIP does not know anything about helping special needs students. Special needs students need to be in a regular school. They were subjected to special education classes as well as bullying in high school. It's time they were placed with the mainstream in college. Community colleges allow special needs students to be INCLUDED unlike VIP! It is not worth the three years at VIP. Parents do your special needs children a favor by not sending them here. Send them to a community college.|Mara19, Now a former VIP student! LOL!

On [[TOW]], Vocational Independence Institution redirects to the NYIT, clearly the leading pioneer in retard-prep.  Their world-class facilities and professional staff are second to most, and their wiki lists major accomplishments such as:

* 2002 - They got internet
* 2003 - 2nd campus indoctrination center opens in [[middle east]]
* 2005 - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Bobby Got 5th place in a solar car race]
* 2007 - Talked about science stuff and got awarded $500,000
* 2008 - Builds another building

The NYTI VIP website is dedicated to a series of values, which they list for the prospective student:

# [[moralfag|Integrity]]
# [[bullshit|Innovation]]
# [[bullshit|Cooperation]]
# [[bullshit|Quality]]
# [[suicide|Commitment]]
# [[NORP|Professionalism]]
# [[WTC|Safety]]

==Q&A: [[Nothing|What do YOU know]] about VIP schools?==

What sorts of qualifications are required?  Well, there's a short answer and a long answer.  The short answer is a pulse, but the long answer is detailed below: all of these future scholars were accepted to NYIT!

==Classes at VIP: Developing the foundation for [[unrealistic expectations|quality education!]]==

The [[stupid|intellectually challenged]] that attend a VIP institution naturally have need of a gentler learning curve.  The following videos illustrate the [[epic fail|typical nature]] of VIP courses which tend to cater to the [[retard|underdeveloped mind]] and prepare them for the real world by way of [[dumbass|simple]] learning steps, an [[Liberalism|interactive experience, and exposure to diversity]].


*Competence in [[Book|literacy]] and [[poetry|communication]] is extremely important to [[Awwright|be competitive]] in [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|industry]].  The following video shows the typical VIP student struggling with a simple problem, then being assisted by a [[nigress|black woman]], which encourages a [[script kiddie|dependence on others to solve their problems for them]] as well as laying the seeds for an underlying hatred of minorities through damaged [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|pride]].


<center><youtube>ML8IL77gQ3k</youtube><br /></center>



*The [[internets|global market]] is constantly expanding.  Exposure to foreign advertising strategies allows students to develop methods of [[For great justice|stealing the good parts of said strategies]] and also learning to [[hate|detest]] the [[Japan|strange and inexplicable nature of foreign peoples.]]

<center><youtube>JRTFVOf6vyI</youtube><br /></center>



*Key to developing advanced learning skills is motivating students to do [[research|independent research projects]].  [[Ali G]], famed VIP graduate, has a classic series of videos where he investigates deeper into a wide variety of topics; one such being [[economics]].  Any VIP institution models their independent projects in a [[copypasta|similar manner]].
