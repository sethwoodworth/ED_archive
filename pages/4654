Kristopher
'''I AM KRISTOPHER''' is a short-lived [[forced meme]] from that filthiest of websites, [[Livejournal]]. The whole thing was spawned during one of the many [[flame war|battles]] between [[homosexual]] [[troll]] [[Chaos wraith x]] and [[wiccan|pagan]] King of the Sockpuppets [[Son of Art]].

==Darkpaganism==
===How it Began===
{{ljcomm|darkpaganism}}, a community noted for its [[retarded|intelligent]] contributions to discussion of the [[magick|occult]], had long since become a stomping ground for Robin Artisson and his [[tl;dr|verbose]], [[shit nobody cares about|off-topic]] bullshit. Sometime in December 2007, [[Chaos wraith x]] did a [[attention whore|bunch of yelling]], and directed the community to Son of Art's [[Son of art|ED page]]. Artisson, fuming with rage attempted to fight back, but was quickly assailed by a few other users.

One of those users was named Kristopher.

Not content with [[masturbation|casting curse spells]], Artisson soon showed up on ED's doorstep, ready for [[vandalism|revenge]]. Artisson, himself owning [[at least 100]] sockpuppets, decided to insist that all of Chaos' friends were, in fact, sockpuppets. Chaos was, in turn, a sockpuppet of Kristopher. [[shit nobody cares about|Or something. I don't fucking know]].

Regardless, after that whole [[clusterfuck]], Chaos and his [[sock puppet|friendslist]] were inexorably [[soul bonding|linked]] to the name Kristopher.

===I AM===
Around this time, only after realizing they'd all been labeled Kristopher, the group came up with a [[stupid|brilliant]] idea: grab a Spartacus icon and [[identity theft|claim to be Kristopher]]. All at once.

Returning to the hallowed halls of {{ljcomm|darkpaganism}}, the group then set upon Artisson, spamming him resolutely with claims of the name of Kristopher until he was forced to [[delete fucking everything|delete his comments]] and flee from the community like a [[butthurt|whipped dog]].

Thus ended the first in what would be a long string of [[9/11|Kristopher-related raids]].

==Trail of Destruction==
Between the months of January and April 2008, Kristopher cut a large swathe of destruction across [[at least 100|a number]] of Livejournal [[community|communities]]. Some of the raided comms include:

* {{ljcomm|metaquotes}}
* {{ljcomm|thedressingroom}}
* {{ljcomm|ask_me_anything}} - This resulted in [[at least 100]] users being banned from the community.
* {{ljcomm|mock_the_stupid}}
* {{ljcomm|objectivists}}
* {{ljcomm|egl}}
* {{ljcomm|badmakeup}}
* [[Childfree]]
* [[CF Hardcore]]
* [[Thequestionclub]]
* [[SF Drama]]

==The Return to Darkpaganism==
Not satisfied with the [[flame war|violence]] and [[ban_set|terror]] induced by raiding random communities, the collective Kristopher set their sights on the cesspool from which they spawned: {{ljcomm|darkpaganism}}. It was late one Saturday in April when Kristopher [[Zerg Rush|descended]] on the unsuspecting community, [[crapflood]]ing, posting fake [[religion|religious]] text, [[intellectual]] [[tl;dr|quandries]], [[pr0n]] and [[epilepsy|seizure-inducing flashing images and text]]. On top of this, they were followed by [[Chris Hansen]], who loudly proclaimed his presence to the community via broken [[HTML]].

The population of Darkpaganism quickly scattered and panicked over the entire mess, and once again, absentee maintainer {{lj|theunicursalhex}} was nowhere to be found. 

Though the planned raid was only supposed to last for [[Rape Clock|three hours at most]], further [[lulz]] were had when [[Son of Art]] returned and proclaimed the villainous monster responsible would [[dying alone|die alone]]. This brought the attention of the parties involved in the raid, and they continued attacking the community for another day altogether.

Kristopher, having [[flame wars#Salt the Earth|salted the earth]] and driven {{ljcomm|darkpaganism}} into the ground, had finally ended his [[terrorist|career]], knowing that his [[lulz|purpose]] had been served.

Two days later, {{lj|theunicursalhex}} returned, deleted most of the Kristopher/Chris Hansen entries, and decided that stricter controls needed to be placed on the community. She also declined [[Son of Art]]'s request for maintainer status, thinking that [[loose Change|he helped stage the whole thing as an excuse to take over the community anyway]].

* Choose a community.
* Flood the community's posts with assertions that you are, in fact, Kristopher.
