'''Newbies (newbs, n3wb5, noobz, n00bs, n00bzors)''' are those, whose [[Loser|lack of capacity for conversation, wit and appropriate behavior in a group setting]] [[IRL]] is amplified when [[OL]], a setting where they feel [[anonymous|liberated]] and therefore have [[Psychopath|no sense of liability]]. They create [[Rage|frustrating]] situations for those they come in contact with. Contrary to the moniker a person can be OL for many, many years and remain quite [[Retarded|n00bish]].

== Characteristics ==

Newbies are [[College|epitomized]] by their lack of knowledge, seemingly unfathomable [[stupid]]ity and ignorance towards the rules and standards of etiquette. They are also known for their [[Drug|excessive use]] of [[1337]] because it's likely that the internet is the [[American|first time in their lives they've been required to use significant reading skills]].

Newbies are susceptible to [[malware]], [[virus]]es/trojans and internet [[scam]]s, because they are not only [[Stupid|naive]] but also have personality faults. [[Lazy]], lascivious, lecherous, [[greed]]y, unwilling to [[read]] anything or [[research]] their new playground, they click eagerly on anything that excites their [[E-psychiatrist|Id]]. After a few thousand [[pop-up]]s and experiencing rapid deterioration of computer performance, they belatedly become afraid that their [[PC]] is filled with some pretty nasty shit. If they see a warning in front of them that says their computer is infected, they erroneously click the shit out of it, hoping for even a meager chance of [[Delete fucking everything|wiping the slate clean]]. The newb will then have to explain to his father or boss why Busty XXX Whores want to perform for him. [[Lulz]].

== Early Newbs ==

The first newb was a member of the [[British]] [[Parliament]] who asked Charles Babbage, "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?" To which Mr. Babbage replied; "I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question." Which is ancient British for "[[Facepalm]]". Newbs therefore inspired the first computer acronym, [[GIGO]].

== Difference between Noob and Newb ==

There is no difference, anyone who says otherwise is spreading cancer
