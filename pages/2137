Like all websites on the [[internets]], [[Death Note|Death Note Online]] tried to exist just for the [[lulz]]. It was a [[gg|noble]] cause, but like all things in life, all it takes is one [[sick fuck]] to screw things over. [[Death Note|Death Note Online]] was a website made for the [[fanboy|fanboys]] of the [[animu]]. The concept was [[shit|simple]]. Write down someone’s name, and then write about how they are going to die in a funny manner. Soon, however, the website backfired. Badly. On November 15, 16, and 17 (of 2007), all hell broke loose over a small high school in northern New Jersey.

[[Image:Kurtteeth.jpg|thumb|110px|A typical Death Note Online user.]]
In order to get onto Death Note Online, all yall have to do is type in “[[shit|Death Note Online]]. Wow. Okay, now crack your fingers, jerk one off, and get ready for the next step. I want you to click on the [[raep|open]] button. Deep breaths, move your hand steadily up and down. Fap, fap, fap. 

Click view entries at the top, and gaze at all the others who have been here before you. A pen should pop up, and that is how you will lead yourself into glory. [[Cock]] in one hand, the other on the keyboard, now [[You]] can [[fail]] too.

People quickly get the point of the website. Put down a name, and make them die in a funny way. Genius, [[amirite]]? [http://www.deathnoteonline.com/page5 The beginning] was great. It was all done for the [[lulz]], and the best thing was, the entire website is [[anonymous]].

Word gets around to the [[sick fuck|quiet kids]] that the site exists. [[dying alone|So they quickly got to work]]. Just in time to fuck it up for the rest of us. Like all the stereotypical quiet kids, they took out their vengeance against the [[fucktard|popular fucks]]. Typing in names faster than [[masturbate|masturbating]], names quickly began to fill the Death Note. And their deaths were not lulz-worthy. 
[http://www.deathnoteonline.com/page645 Check out Megan Smith and Bennet] 

As it turns out, almost all of [http://www.krhs.net/ Kittatinny Regional High School] is on the website. It’s more accurate than the yearbook. Soon, more and more names began to turn up on the website, names of [[camwhores]], [[goths]], and [[nerds]] poured in.

[http://www.deathnoteonline.com/page684 check out the only Dan!]

[http://www.deathnoteonline.com/page630 Paige becomes a victim]

[http://www.deathnoteonline.com/page644 Devyn becomes a [[sick fuck|sick fuck’s]] new twisted wet dream.]

The school took action as soon as all the popular girls and boys began to complain, and many students were raided.

Fingers were pointed. Kids were crying. Names were withdrawn. All in all, Kittatinny was up in arms for about two days. For two days, all the popular coc– I mean jocks, couldn’t trust anyone. Especially those [[sick fuck|quiet kids]] that they made fun of maybe just one too many times. 

Death Note Online is still up and running, but is getting more anti-lulz. 

[[You]] can help by either raiding [http://www.deathnoteonline.com/ Death Note Online] or [http://www.krhs.net/ KRHS]. Do [[You|Your]] part and achieve the lulz.

As of November 21, 2007, the School Administration has believed that the "writers" of the horrible death notes have been caught and are getting [[serious business|punished]]. 

{{quote|As of now, we would like to thank all the [[anonymous]] students who helped us narrow down our search for the contributors to the horrible and sick website. Have a Happy [[Thanksgiving]].| School Vice-Principal}}

It's obvious that the admins are still scared [[shit|shitless]], seeing as their names were taking up space on the website as well.
