The licenses for most [[software]] are designed to [[anal]]ly [[rape]] you, leave your destroyed [[ass]] on a Hollywood sidewalk, where your tattered remains will be photographed and dumped on the [[internets]]. By contrast, the '''[[GNU]] General Public License''' is intended to guarantee your [[freedom]] to share and modify your ass--to make sure that it is free for all its users. It will also give you [[AIDS]] and make sure that anyone using your ass will get it as well. Oh, and this also applies to software, too.  Speaking of software, this General Public License applies to most of the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s software and to any other program whose authors commit to abusing it. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to [[freedom]], including the freedom to deny other people's freedoms.  Incidentally, this does not mean lower prices. As [[Microsoft]] has [http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/facts/default.mspx factually shown], most GPLed software is actually more expensive than proprietary software.  Still, our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the [[freedom]] to charge for copies of "[[free]]" software, that you receive [[source code]] or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new [[free]]ware programs; and that you know you can deny others the right to do these things.

The new GPL version 3 will be so powerful that it will allow the [[Free Software Foundation]] to [[pwned]] [http://www.forbes.com/2006/10/12/biz-biztech_cz_dl_1030forbes_104_slide.html all major tech companies including] [[IBM]], [[Sun]], [[Red Hat]], HP and [[Novell]].
