Guess the Gender
{{pixpls}}

'''Guess the Gender''' is an old forum game played by members of the [[Anti-Emo Federation]], started by [[Mission: MySpace]]. It started in 2006, then became inactive for a period, and is now back up and running. It's a source of [[lulz]] when [[emo]] [[fag]]s find it.

==RULES==

These are the actual game rules.

<div style="color: black; background-color: white; border: thin black solid; padding: .5em;">Every day, I will post the images of some [[emo]]s or [[scene]] kids. Your job is to guess the gender(s) of the individuals posted.

Each emo has one primary gender. The four primary genders are: [[fag|emofag]], [[bitch|emobitch]], [[dyke|emodyke]], and [[LOLWUT|hermie]] (hermaphrodite/androgyne). No emo has [[divide by zero|multiple primary genders]].

Some emos also have secondary genders. Valid secondary genders are [[tranny]] and [[fat|whale]]. For each secondary gender you identify correctly, if you got the emo's primary gender correct, you get a point. However, if you call a non-tranny a tranny or a non-whale a whale, your response will be [[DOIN IT RONG|marked as incorrect]]. Remember: not all emos have secondary genders.

NEW TWISTS

Some rounds, I will leave some sort of hint as to the emo's gender - a puzzle, a URL, a bulletin (add me to get these), or something of that nature.

The "me factor" is also going to play into it - some rounds, I will guess the emo's gender. I may use my [[sockpuppet|other profiles]]. Sometimes I will guess correctly, sometimes I will intentionally guess incorrectly. It's up to you whether or not you trust me.

If you get five rounds in a row entirely correct, you will get an [[for great justice|emo link]]. If you get ten rounds in a row entirely correct, [[winrar|your score will be tripled]].</div>

Posting this game in an emo forum is a [[win|great]] [[troll]]ing tactic and a source of many [[lulz]].
