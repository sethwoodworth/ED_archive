{{quote|Community-collaborated Q&A, the wiki way.}}

'''WikiAnswers''' from Answers.com is the same as [[Yahoo Answers|Yahoo! Answers]], but with marginally less stupid questions and answers. Nevertheless, it does not stop people from asking questions like "''[http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Can_you_get_sick_from_swallowing_sperm Can you get sick from swallowing sperm?]''" or "''[http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_china_in_western_or_eastern_china Is china in western or eastern china?]''". '''WikiAnswers''' is owned by Answers.com, and much like [[TOW]], is owned and run by [[Jews]] for [[profit]]<sup>[http://www.answers.com/main/ir/about_company.jsp]</sup>.

==Incentives==
'''WikiAnswers''' provides very little incentive to actually contribute to the community. You can ask as many questions as you like, and the only reward you get for answering questions is a little number next to your name and perhaps a spot on the leader board. Naturally, this system of maximal effort, minimal reward attracts the unemployed, the disabled and the autistic to contribute to the website, leaving [[Noone|those of us with a life]] to ask silly questions while high.

==Choice Q & A==
[[Image:Wikianswersq.png|thumb|right|350px|Doing it right]]
'''Q: [http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_pictures_on_offended_from_encyclopedia_dramatica What are the pictures on offended from encyclopedia dramatica?]'''

'''Q: [http://wiki.answers.com/Q/I_am_34_and_a_virgin_should_I_give_up_trying_to_find_someone_and_just_hire_an_escort_to_lose_my_virginity I am 34 and a virgin should I give up trying to find someone and just hire an escort to lose my virginity?]'''

A: "[[Bullshit|No, you should keep trying to find the right person for you before loosing your virginity. Virginity is a very precious item that cannot be replaced, so you may feel like you have lost something if you hire an escort to loose it to.]]"

'''Q: [http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Can_you_still_have_sex_when_you_are_on_your_period Can you still have sex when you are on your period?]'''

A: "[[Winner|Yes and sometimes it can be more enjoyable than when you are not on your period. It can get messy but who cares, if you are enjoying it why stop. Why stop yourself from getting pleasure just because you're on your period. Go for it I certainly do.]]"

A: /v/ is that way ----->

==Why no lulz?==
The reason '''WikiAnswers''' contains significantly less lulz than [[Yahoo Answers|Yahoo! Answers]] is because the content is heavily moderated, just like [[TOW]]. There are no arguments, and troll answers are easily deleted by contributors because its a wiki. Questions that devolve into debates and cause drama are quickly locked down with an [[unfunny|NPOV]] answer. Despite having almost unlimited possibilities with questions, answers are water-down shit.

==The Orange Guy==

ED has [[Ae-tan]], TOW has [[Wikipe-tan]], and '''WikiAnswers''' has "The Orange Guy". Rather than being a [[Weaboo|kawaii]] gothic lolita however, The Orange Guy is the [[fail|fluid orange stickman]] from 90s [[Nickelodeon]].

{{tinyquote|Blanchette says it was more by accident that the Orange Guy has a great balance of "cute" and "professional" with his big head, chubby extremities, lack of facial features, and puffy-cartoon body.|WikiAnswers}}

The concept of The Orange Guy as "cute and professional" further stigmatizes '''WikiAnswers''' as a watered-down internet corporation, intent on drawing in users who won't be offended by foreign or otherwise controversial content.
