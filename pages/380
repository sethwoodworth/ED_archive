Almost-Chan
{{old}}

On December 11,2007 [[Anonymous]] once again showed their love of cats.
In a [[thread]] lasting [[at least 100]] posts, [[/b/]] gave OP advice on how to keep a kitten found under a trash bin alive. 
Within the thread there was only one mention of [[zippocat]], and a few sets of [[spam]]ming "[[guro|rape it to death]]" and "[[Lolwut|juden]]". 
The strength of Anon's feline [[rape|love]] overcame those easily with offerings of [[jew gold]] to support this new-found [[lolcat|feline]] mascot.
After hours of anxiety the newborn, dubbed "Almost-Chan" seemed to be in good health.

This kitten and the OP are so full of [[epic win]], they have received the [[Unwarranted Self Importance|Official 4chan Seal of Approval]].
