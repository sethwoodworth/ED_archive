Coke Music
'''Cokemusic''' is what you get when combine the shitty interface of [[Habbo Hotel]] and the [[lag]] of [[Furcadia]], with 15% less [[homosexual]] [[furries]]. It was designed by Sulake, the parent company of [[AIDS|Habbo]], so expecting anything other than fail would be [[trying too hard]].

In some strange way, it was somehow better than Habbo Hotel because you don't have to pay [[money]] for anything, but then again, [[Maple Story]] is free, and that still isn't any better than the shittiest [[MMORPG]]. However, MMO's are shitty anyway, yet [[retards|people]] continue to use them. 

The main objective of Cokemusic was to create songs in exchange for '''cred''' from users, creating [[Rave|dance parties]] and attempting to become the next hottest DJ by mixing pre-recorded loops together, just like in the real world.

In 2007 after the disbandment of Cokemusic, Habbo introduced a similar feature called [[shit nobody cares about|trax]], which is far easier to work with, but even [[shit|shittier]].
