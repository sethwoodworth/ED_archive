Church signs
{{needsmoar|Text - maybe a gallery}}
Church signs are [[God]]'s way of communicating to you what he wants you to learn this week! Alot like Polka Dot Door. Like both you drive by, or in the case of the 'The Door' you flip by it, you stop for a bit, try to pay attention to what the message is, and then move along. But in the end noone pays attention to them, because it's the church, and in the case of 'The Door' it was somewhat [[French]]. And noone pays attention to [[French]] people anymore.[[Image:Th_sign_church_knees.jpeg|thumb|God has many positions he wishes you to 'experience'.]]

Another example is a loose mouth can find it's ways into a tight spot, and other oral sex related phrases.
