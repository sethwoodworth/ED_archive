{{Quote|TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life|Motto and (failed) goal}}

'''TV Tropes''' is a custom-designed [[wiki]] devoted to entertainment media. Topics range from how much everybody loves [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer|Buffy]], how much everybody hates [[Twilight]], long discussions about the [[Fact|accuracy]] of some interpretation of a [[Neon Genesis Evangelion|completely fucked up TV show]], [[fap]]ping over anything and everything [[Japan]]ese, arguments and whining over every little change to the site, and, rarely, sub-par analysis of tropes and storytelling conventions.

Despite ostensibly being based around the model of literary analysis popularized by Joseph Campbell, it is much closer in spirit to [[4chan]] due to the average member's favoritism towards [[in-joke]]y [[meme]]s over clear communication and constant in-fighting due to allowing any and every [[fandom]] to use the site, but without any self-deprecating awareness of their own idiocy. As a result, just as how [[deviantART]] breeds hack artists and [[FanFiction.Net]] breeds hack writers, TV Tropes breeds hack critical analysts.

The site is largely characterized by its high saturation of [[basement dweller]]s, [[aspie]]s, [[weeaboos]], wannabe [[elitist]] sophisticates, [[fanfiction]] writers spamming about their latest [[Final Fantasy VII|Cloud/Sephiroth]] [[slashfic]], and [[troll]]s milking them all for the [[lulz]].

[[You]] can find the website [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage here] and a guide on how to be a [[Troll|productive]] [[Vandal|member]] [[Vandal/How-to#TV_Tropes_and_Other_Ghetto_Custom_Wikis|here]].

=History=
[[Image:TvtropesLogoOld.png|thumb|Former TV Tropes logo]]

Before [[Al Gore]] and [[Internet|his greatest contribution to humanity]], memes were controlled by a small circle of [[oldfags|writers and poets]]. [[Shakespeare]] dubbed these literary memes "tropes". [[At least 100|Over the next century]], more and more people were invited into the writers' circle and the tropes spread. Eventually, [[newfags|modern media]] abused these tropes until they became [[cliché]] and commonplace. Tropes were not a secret any longer and viewers and readers began to spot them instantaneously in any [[manga]], [[television]] show, or [[movie]] they watched.

In 2003, it was determined that an entire wiki should be constructed to contain these tropes, and thus TV Tropes was created due to popular demand. Shortly thereafter, an invading army of weeaboos, furries, and other leprous retards overran the place and drove the founder of the site, Fast Eddie, farther to the faggot side. Sing a song of mourning to a once [[AIDS]]-free site, for it is no more. A place where the conversations of friends and lovers echoed through the halls has now been replaced by the yiffing of [[furries]] and the squealing of [[wapanese]].

{{Quote|We are not Wikipedia. We're a [[goatse|buttload]] more informal.|TV Tropes on article style}}

When discussing article format, TV Tropes often compares itself to [[Wikipedia]], which it has dubbed "[[The Other Wiki]]", or "TOW". ([[Some argue]] that TV Tropes [[Al Gore|invented]] the term "The Other Wiki".) Unlike Wikipedia and its [[OCD]]-filled [[cabal]], TV Tropes does not revolve around [[serious business]] or [[notability]].

Many users, however, seem to forget this quite often.

The worst example of this is the large population of [[weeaboos]] on the site, who seem to be on some sort of [[Mormon|god-given mission]] to make sure that every page will have a Japanese name, [[over 9000]] [[anime]] and [[manga]] examples and a [[shitty|nice]] little picture from [[Shit nobody cares about|some random anime series]] on them. This is made worse by the fact that examples are sorted alphabetically by medium, and "anime" comes before "film", "literature", and "TV". Engaging this problem [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|head on]] is, as proven by brave attempts from the other parts of the userbase, known to generate massive [[butthurt]] amongst these pathetic [[neckbeard]]s, and will send them out in long and exhausting [[circlejerk]]s with occasional cries of "persecution" and "marginalization", which will continue until any opposition gives up in frustration. But they will accept marginalization if all media are marginalized [[equal rights|equally]], which can be done with the "folder control" that [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Collapsing Objects|collapses]] each medium, hiding anime examples from everyone who doesn't want to look at them (like us).

Any [[Oxymoron|intelligent Internet-goer]] should also be wary of the heavy infestation of [[furries]] and other [[attention whore]]s, who regularly abuse the no-notability guideline, using the site as a dump for various shitty and AIDS-infested [[webcomic]]s and [[fanfic]]s, and make a sport out of adding these shit stains of the Internet on every trope page they can think of, no matter how vague (or non-existent) the connection is. But at least "webcomics" are near the bottom of example lists, and you can use folders on them too.

Much of the site is hellbent on sucking the collective cocks of all the members of [[That Guy With The Glasses]] and [[The Spoony Experiment]]. The moment one of them reviews something, the page for it will get rewritten to conform to their opinion, swamped with tropes that only pertain to the online review, and get linked on So Bad It's Good/Horrible less than an hour after it goes live. If no page exists for the work reviewed, then a page will be erected based only on clips seen in the video. Every further reference to the work anywhere else on the wiki will promptly get spammed by quotes and memes from the episode in question. In turn, several TGWTG members think it's hilarious to make thinly-veiled references to TV Tropes, which only serves to encourage them.

==Troper Tales==

[[Image:Trope-tan fanart.png|thumb|left|200px|Tropers are [[bullshit|very talented artists]].]]

[[File:Bubble Asian Man.jpg|thumb|What happens if you browse TV Tropes for too long.]]

{{Quote|This troper is 6'6, can beat up a room full of people by walking in, can bench press 4 elephants balancing on each others' backs, and is geared up for getting a First at Oxford. And invented C++. And TV Tropes. And the Sun.|[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/GeniusBruiser The average Troper's Tale]. [[Lie|Not a parody.]]}}

{{Quote|Whenever someone creates a new Troper Tales page, a kitten is put in a blender.|[http://tinyurl.com/TroperBlendKitten An apt description.]}}

One of the most popular parts of the site is a section called "Troper Tales". Here, the [[aspie]] [[basement dweller]]s write monumental loads of [[bullshit]] about how they're totally awesome [[Mary Sue]]s ([http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/MarySue oh, wait...]) and not a waste product of society. Some fantasies they want the world to indulge them in include:

* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/BrilliantButLazy Brilliant But Lazy]: "I'm totally smarter than Albert Einstein multiplied by Stephen Hawking, but because I'm lazy, I'm writing an anonymous self-congratulatory paragraph on a Wiki instead of curing cancer."
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/ReallyGetsAround Really Gets Around]: "I'm totally not a virgin! In fact, I slept with hundreds of women while I was in the waiting room for a dental cleaning appointment!"
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/BeautifulAllAlong Beautiful All Along]: "I look ugly, but I'm really beautiful when I get my hair shampooed, change out of my filthy clothes into a dress, have extensive plastic surgery to remove all the potch marks, and I [[Photoshop]] a celebrity's head over my own. Honest."
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/InsufferableGenius Insufferable Genius]: "I'm a fucking douchebag and I admit it, but I'm a Mensa member, so FUCK YOU!"
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/TheWoobie The Woobie]: "PITY ME, GOD FUCKING DAMMIT!"
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/BreakTheCutie Break The Cutie]: "Hey, I am the fucking nicest, purest and sweetest human being to ever live! And, as all of you lower forms of life know, every day of my existence is a blessing to you worthless pieces of garbage and your shitty planet! Then why the fuck are you assholes being so mean to poor little me?!? [[Hugbox|HUGS PLZ!!!]]"
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/BrotherSisterIncest Brother Sister Incest]: Deleted due to epic failure.
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/CompleteMonster Complete Monster] Deleted once already because it became the bees knees for delusional teenage retards that aspired to show how badass they are by writing fictional stories about their murderous rampages. "This one bully used to tease me in school, so I pushed him down the stairs and broke his neck, AND FELT NO REMORSE!!!1"
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/InsaneTrollLogic Insane Troll Logic]: How fucking morons on TV Tropes try to disguise their idiocy, by using a tacky misrepresented word to help them feel better for being dropped on their head. None of it is insane, logical or trolling, but don't tell them that! You'll hurt their feelings, and they will resort to [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/TearJerker crying about it in the same wiki...]
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/LimitedWardrobe Limited Wardrobe]: Disgusting board where scores of tropers admit to never changing clothes. [[lie|But they wash all time, though.]]

Here's a fun game: find a page that doesn't have a Troper Tales yet (for example, [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/BadAss Bad Ass]). Write an obvious parody making up the dumbest shit possible. Without fail, dozens of other entries will pop up essentially claiming "no, MY story is better than YOURS!" You can already see the results of this on [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TroperTales/GeniusBruiser Genius Bruiser].

==[[Inevitable|Edit Banned]]==
[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=5cma6iojg5o27puhulc24sje&page=1 This is the area in the forum] where people who get [[Banned|lolbanned]] from TV Tropes go to suck Fast Eddie's dick, and pray that is magical cum of story catalogging will allow them to come back and complain how bad the Last Airbender movie was. Note how only the illiterate retards, attention whores and trolls come to this thread and beg to come back, and nobody with any visible intelligence comes here. Mostly this thread serves to help Fast Eddie increase the size of his ePenis by telling retards to fuck off (while secretly letting them suck his dick and have cybersex with them in PMs to earn their way back onto the site).

==Subjective Tropes==

Unofficial site policy holds that TV Tropes is [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ptitleq40okv0trw6h not the place to whine, moan, or bitch about anything and everything]. A quick look at [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YMMV the Subjective Tropes index] (also known as Your Mileage May Vary) and everything that links to the pages contained within will reveal that to be [[bullshit]] of the highest order.

In truth, the Subjective Tropes are completely useless because tropers have no standards whatsoever and add the most pathetically shoehorned examples as a knee-jerk reaction. It's a redundant category anyway, since almost all categories on the website are the result of subjective hair-splitting.  They serve as a telling sign of how pathetic they really are. Things you will learn about tropers from the subjective tropes:

* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel Nightmare Fuel]: Tropers are gigantic fucking [[pussies]] that shit their pants every time the ice cream truck comes around the corner.
:* Tropers are pussies who can't tell the difference between what is and what isn't supposed to be scary. This means a lot of shit that should have been marked [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighOctaneNightmareFuel High Octane Nightmare Fuel] is marked as regular nightmare fuel.
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discontinuity Discontinuity]: "I don't like this work, therefore, I declare it to not exist!"
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker Tear Jerker]: "My favorite character just found out the clerk at Starbucks shorted him a nickel. I... I think I'm gonna cry... [[BAWWWWW]]!"
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowningMomentOfAwesome Crowning Moment Of Awesome]: Absolutely anything and everything about a troper's favorite show, ever, collected onto a set of hideously gigantic pages.
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDecay Adaptation Decay]: If the [[animu]] of their favorite [[manga]] decides to change the birthday of the coffee shop clerk that appeared in some bullshit filler chapter, the neckbeards will all scream "DECAY!" and bitch about how it's a corruption of a literary masterpiece and that evil company is taking a giant shit on the franchise.
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon Moral Event Horizon]: "This character cut somebody off at the turnpike. UNFORGIVABLE! [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster COMPLETE MONSTER!]"
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard Magnificent Bastard]: Who the hell even knows what this means any more?
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/DethroningMomentOfSuck Dethroning Moment Of Suck]: Distilled [[Nerd Rage]] so pure that you can almost hear the grinding of many gritted teeth, smell the countless pants that were pissed in anger, and taste the bitter, salty tears dripping from hundreds of double chins.
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/Ptitlew9bltta3dv6n So Bad It's Horrible]: Exactly the same thing as Dethroning Moment Of Suck. In theory, DMOS is the scene when a work becomes SBIH, but in practice, there's no fucking difference in the pages themselves. Tropers still use this as a way to pretend their opinions are [[fact]]s by linking to it when they talk about [[Twilight]] and shit.  Until it's replaced with a link to [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ptitlethsq3mffp09i So Bad It's Good], because it turns out that there is a single toe-sucking bumblefuck who actually enjoys it for reasons other than laughing at someone's failure.  And that one person somehow makes it not a complete piece of shit.
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay Ho Yay]: "Two characters of the same sex are close friends. They must be [[gay]]!"
* [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFicRecommendations Fanfic Recommendations]: Users within the fanfiction "canon" suck each other's e-peens while simultaneously providing ample lulz to those brave enough to read the "masterpieces" linked.  Note how they either aren't as great as the other authors claim, and/or are written by [[sick fuck]]s.

Finally discovering the lit drama bomb in their hands, the admins of TV Tropes have decided to take all of the Subjective Tropes from the "main pages" and putting them in their own [[ghetto]], possibly hoping to apply the [[final solution]] to them, when nobody is looking, as the community would instantly shit itself and then roll over and die, if their precious opinionated pieces were outright deleted.

==Trolling TV Tropes==

TV Tropes is a more difficult site than most to [[troll]] due to the fact that most tropers are already gigantic trolls, but since it's mostly [[attention whore|posters of note]] who engage in this sort of behaviour, they easily [[hypocrisy|get away with it]]. It's like trying to troll [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|this very wiki]]: the bar is much higher than usual. Grab your notebooks, [[Script kiddies|kiddies]], for here is the list of ways tropers troll themselves and how [[you]] can imitate them:

[[Image:Natter.gif|thumb]]

The first thing to know is that there are both edit bans and forum bans, thus two goes at trolling on a single account. Save the forum for later, as they provide more exquisite drama.

First we'll discuss trolling on the the wiki itself. Most important, above everything else: if you happen to see an example that is wrong, or written in a way you don't like, or says a work is shit/good, or raises a point you'd really like to talk about, just put a bullet point under it continuing the line of conversation. TV Tropes calls this "[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConversationInTheMainPage Conversation On The Main page]" (or "natter" as everybody that isn't an admin calls it) and long batches of it "[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreadMode Thread Mode];" we call it "our god given right."
* Actually, they call it "Conversation '''In''' The Main Page." It's even in your link, but you're too lazy a fuck to even read it.
** Fuck you, I was on a deadline to write this.
*** Guys, shut the fuck up. Conversation On The Main Page is a valid redirect. Both of you fail for not looking at the alt title box in the upper right.
** This Christian troper is offended by OP by his uncapitalized usage of the name God. Do not hold God's name in vain, you fucker.
*** Does your god (HAHA HOW R U GONNA STOP ME?!) approve of you calling people fuckers?
*** Fuck you, God doesn't care if I swear at you. You're just a heretic.
(The above example is a prime example of [[unfunny]] meta-humour that is loved so much by all tropers. Try to imitate it and other tropers will add to your natter on their own, making it grow to a bloated tumor that remains surprisingly long, since it's obviously tongue-in-cheek, amirite?)

After a little spot of shit-stirring, read the [[TV Tropes#Troper Tales|Troper Tales]] section above. Now write about [[you]] and your shitty friends on the main wiki instead of the Troper Tales page. When making these edits, always use "this troper" to refer to yourself. It Just Bugs Me (the wiki pages, not the subforum) is a prime place to foster your nerd rage and call every work 'riddled with plotholes' just because your measly brain couldn't get it. Write negative Reviews for popular works. The options are virtually endless. Squick everyone by adding creepy things to the Fetish Fuel page. Use old pothole memes that the site deleted for being utter shit such as "I Am Not Making This Up" and "Rape The Dog".

One thing worth pointing out is that all redirects are displayed at the top of the page in a box named "alt title(s)". Since TV Tropes claimed that "[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeedsARedirect?from=Main.RedirectsAreFree Redirects Are Free]", there's nothing stopping you from making redirects out of [[tl;dr]] [[verbose thread]] diarrhea and then making a new one for every last possible wording. For example, [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueEyes Blue Eyes] can have redirects from "People With Low Amounts Of Melanin Within The Iris Stroma", "People That Have Low Amounts Of Melanin Within The Iris Stroma", "People Lacking Melanin Within The Iris Stroma", "Men Lacking Melanin Within The Iris Stroma", "Men With Low Amounts Of Melanin Within The Iris Stroma", "Men That Have Low Amounts Of Melanin Within The Iris Stroma", "Women Lacking Melanin Within The Iris Stroma", "Women With Low Amounts Of Melanin Within The Iris Stroma", "Women That Have Low Amounts Of Melanin Within The Iris Stroma", "Azure Eyes", "Baby Blue Eyes", "Sky Blue Eyes", "Silvery Blue Eyes", "Greenish Blue Eyes", "Aquamarine Eyes", "Navy Blue Eyes", "Eton Blue Eyes", "Cerulean Eyes", and so on. All of that will appear on the top of the page and if they complain, just tell them you're helping to make the article easier to find on Google.

The forums are even funnier. Your first stop will be in Trope Repair Shop, where you will oppose every single rename or major revision, evar, merely on principle. This is usually accompanied by claiming bad faith on the part of "SPOON" (some group that TOTALLY WANTS TO TURN THE SITE INTO WIKIPEDIA, GUYZ!) and talking about how they're fighting the war to keep creativity in. Occasionally, they might actually give reasons why they oppose the action, but that usually just comes down to "I like it, therefore, EVERYONE ELSE MUST LIKE IT!" It's just as retarded as it sounds, but judging by [[Wapanese|Nakama]], IT FUCKING WORKS! (Protip: mention [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nakama Nakama], or any Japanese trope name for that matter, in a rename discussion for some prime [[lulz]]). The other side of this is to say "We are not [[4chan]]" or "We are not Encyclopedia Dramatica" (HEY GUYZ THAT'S NOT NICE!). They even created an article called "[[Godwin's Law|Troper's Law]]" that you can see [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/Ptitler7tmx55n here].

Moving on to other fertile grounds, Yack Fest is the place where tropers go for their daily attention fix, and especially the Insecurity thread can be mined for lulz by giving faux advice. The gender threads (just pick one at random, there's a new one every week) are also good. Just drop a comment about being totally incapable of understanding transgendered individuals (90% of the userbase), sit back and watch the drama unfold. Complain about every last little fucking thing that happens with the site both on the Wiki Talk and It Just Bugs Me subforum (duplicate threads are advised). The [[Waaaambulance]] never rests. Make a thread complaining about a meme, buzzword or other insignificant little thing in It Just Bugs Me. Godmod in Forum Games. Start a liveblog, then never finish it in Live Bloginations. Writer's Block and World Building are where the [[aspierations|aspiring]] authors talk about their hackneyed [[anime]]-inspired [[fantasy]] stories. Easy lulz can be had by giving [[constructive criticism]], calling them out on ripping off other stories, and suggesting blatantly satirical and/or sabotaging ideas. Concern Troll in On-Topic Conversations. Imitation and infiltration works better than spot-it-from-a-mile trolling, as evidenced by the Leanan fiasco, where a troper created a cute sockpuppet persona then made her die, provoking many tears.

However, none of this compares to the [[Hiroshima]] of trolling: mention ED! Srsly, it doesn't matter what context you use it in. If you mention ED and don't call it the most evil site on the internet, a flame war will instantly break out as tropers start throwing hissy fits and call you the next Hitler. Try to save this for the end of your career on the site because the moment you drop a mention of ED, dozens of tropers will start [[Wikistalking|stalking all your edits]] for just about anything to get you [[banned]].

==The problem with TV Tropes (fo' realz)==

[[Image:Tvtropesbawwwww.GIF|thumb|right|200px|A compilation of some of the BAWWWWW that the site gets daily. Just look at the fucking thing.]]

As the previous sections illustrate, the average "troper" is a gigantic fucking retard, but luckily, anyone with a degree in Internet [[Psychology]] can easily figure out why they're so stupid.

Your average troper is a [[fantard]] devoted to at least one work or creator. Like all fantards, it's a religion to them: they are close-minded to any view not conforming to their viewpoint, and they will start holy wars if people disrespect their faith. They even admit everyone is part of some blindly devoted fanbase [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability here]. This is why they're convinced that vilifying their opponents and making slippery slope platitudes about "WE ARE NOT WIKIPEDIA!" and "STOP SUCKING THE FUN OUT OF THIS SITE!" is the way to debate everything. It is why they created opposed groupings "SPOON" and "FORKS" for the sake of being able to say "ALL THOSE SPOON MOTHERFUCKERS ARE RUINING THIS SITE!" It is why nobody can fucking '''debate''' anything.

Related to the above, your average Troper is blatantly anti-intellectual, has a ridiculously small comfort zone, and thinks anything that isn't stupidly simplistic or entirely based on emotion is bad. Not only are they idiots, they distrust anyone else that isn't also an idiot. They honestly believe responding to a well-reasoned argument with [[tl;dr]] is just peachy keen. It's also the reason why they hate [[Wikipedia]]. They are too proudly stupid to write for it and need a site where they don't have to prove shit or actually give a real argument for anything.

Much like the English professor who reads too much into something, tropers are content to see subtext where there is none and argue endlessly about it (albeit with a much dumber vocabulary). The average troper has a self-important perception of themselves as some sort of guardian of fiction, and is thus able to discern which devices the creator of a work should or should not use.  The idea of [[Old_Meme|"Discredited Tropes"]] is proof of this delusion. There is a mistaken belief that a list of story-telling devices as perceived by autistics is a legitimate guide to literature, film, music, and games.  But devoid of their proper context, these individual tropes are meaningless and won't help the poor soul with his scriptwriting class.

The "real life" sections are the cancer that is killing TV Tropes. It's bad enough they spend all their time consuming and talking about shitty children's TV shows they're 10 years too old to be watching, but having sections where they apply fictional tropes to real life makes them think their lives are just as banal as their favorite fiction and everything really does boil down to "I am obviously right" versus "they are obviously wrong". It is why they feel entitled to write monumental loads of bullshit about themselves and a whole section of the site called Troper Tales had to be made to keep all the fuckery off the main site. It is why they are so averse to anything not as simple as black and white. This belief that they're living out the story of [[Harry Potter]] or some other shitty fantasy is why they can't function as a productive member of society.

To top it all off, the [[aspie]] count on TV Tropes is through the roof. Both real aspies and self-diagnosed "I want an excuse to be a fucktard" aspies. THEY TAKE PRIDE IN THIS. THEY DON'T WANT TO CHANGE. THAT IS WHY THEY ARE ON TV TROPES INSTEAD OF A REAL SITE.

[[tl;dr]] tropers are delusional aspie fantards that think the world is just like [[Pokémon]] and they are totally the heroes. [[Fail|I am not making this up]]. Now back to your regular scheduled [[lulz]].

== TV Tropes declares war on lulz ==

[[Image:The_Lulzkiller.jpg|thumb|left|Only known photo of [[anti-lulz|Fast Eddie]] without his mask.]]

{{quote|Yeah, you're not going to be happy here. We're out of the bile business.|Fast Eddie}}

{{quote|This post was '''thumped''' by the Shillelagh of Whackingness}}

In June 2010, site owner Fast Eddie and a bunch of the admins sat down and talked about how they believed that the amount of "negativity", "[[lulz|libel]]" and "[[truth|slander]]" on some pages was getting overwhelming. They decided that they were too lazy/busy giving each other handjobs to continuously monitor the pages in question, and, instead of actually doing the reasonable thing and hire some niggers and spics to do the job, Fast Eddie stepped in, stripped half of the pages' content, and locked them from further editing. This, of course, led to hilarious examples of [[hypocrisy]], such as pages like [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors Protection From Editors] (which is portrayed as a bad thing on the page) getting protection from editors (get it?), and [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrwellianEditor Orwellian Editor] (again: portrayed as a bad thing) was suddenly missing a good chunk of text without so much as getting a notice that explained why. 

This of course was a clear signal that you now have to be a super-[[HIV|positive]] ass-fairy in order to edit TV Tropes, and that any edginess, such as calling retarded creators out on the bad quality of their shitty work and their shitty behavior, is now strictly verboten (and, yes, that especially applies to [[Chris-chan]] and [[Tim Buckley]]). This ultimately means that any trace of funniness that ever was to be found in the wiki is now completely gone. Forever. Well, not forever; their pages on Maradonia Saga still makes fun of it, and several other pages do too.

[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Ptitleh1qfbg3l Of course, Fast Eddie shows he's perfectly fine with a really harsh article on some furry's bad fanfic by helpfully moving it to its proper place]. [[wut|But rules were made to be broken by the people who made them, right?]]

==Their article on Encyclopedia Dramatica==
[[file:cutlist1.png|200px|thumb|left|Note how Fast Eddie gave no reason the second time...]]
[[file:cutlist2.png|200px|thumb|left|...and how it had to be cut three times before they sent it off to the permanent redlink club.]]
[[File:Redlink.png|200px|thumb|right|In an epic moment of [[fail]], they cop one of our own catch phrases and leave a big-ass redlink to our article on the very page where they explain ''why'' they no longer have an article on us.]]
{{quote|•Kick The Dog: Some people who are attacked really do have personality and mental disorders that haven't been taken care of well. Encyclopedia Dramatica holds nothing back for those people.}}

{{quote|•Over Nine Thousand: They seem to love this one. Its ubiquity is derided on some pages. On one of the new Improvement Drive pages, it pretty much says "No more. Alright? Stop."}}
They used to have an article on us, no lie. There was a time when it was locked on a version that spent several paragraphs acting like this site is the root of all evil on the internet (sort of like every other website in existence) and violated their own unspoken rules about not declaring real life people or organizations as "evil", but after some time, Fast Eddie went through and deleted most of that. It was locked partly to keep out the schmucks that [[Asking for it|think it's a good idea to taunt ED]], but mostly because they were worried that [[Troll|some enterprising individuals]] might spread [[truth]] about the site.

Unfortunately, his lulz-steamroller didn't stop there. For a time, the Reviews and It Just Bugs Me sections were unlocked and unmoderated, predictably devolving into cesspools of drama, hyperbole and butthurt over Encyclopedia Dramatica's very existence. Since Fast Eddie seems to now be taking lessons from the [[Conservapedia|Andrew Schlafly]] School of Wiki Management, he predictably locked and deleted both sections. After some [[DO IT FAGGOT|careful consideration]], he went ahead with axing and salting the main article as well. This just goes to show that they're major pussies because if [[Wikipedia]] can maintain an article despite ED going so far as to make a [[Portal:Wikipedia|whole goddamn portal criticizing them]], why can't they handle one single article?

However, it can still be made at ptitles3n797ms, which translates in [[moonspeak]] to Encyclopædia Dramatica. If you recreate it at the latter, they won't catch us as fast!

==[[Google]] [[pwn]]s TV Tropes==
On October 27th, 2010, [[Google]] noticed the sheer oversaturation of [[sick fuck]]s on the site and [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=9lvm2r0f3zho5qst6yux72it&page=2#47 pulled their advertising]. Since the site [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=9lvm2r0f3zho5qst6yux72it&page=4#86 costs thousands of dollars a month] and [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=9lvm2r0f3zho5qst6yux72it&page=2#27 they only had enough money for one more month], there was a very real possibility the site might have died. The bureaucrats started working overtime to [[X FUCKING Y|censor fucking everything]] and the [[BAWWWWW]] levels eclipsed even the Sonichu drama.

Sadly, it was not to last. After creating an [[Soviet Union|Iron Curtain]] around the most blatant "mature content" and finding a [[Advertise_on_Encyclopedia_Dramatica|less discriminating advertising company]] for those pages, Google gave them back their ads on November 9th. Many lulz were killed in the process.

You can still [[Troll|help]], though! Since the whole site is full of [[Anti-lulz|content unsuitable for any decent human being]], be sure to report every single page on the wiki as "mature content" (the button named "report this article" in the upper left corner). Start with [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/index_report.php this page] and work your way down the list.

==IJBM CONTROVERSY==

In the post-festive spirit of 2010, Fast Eddie decided to troll the site's users by announcing the deletion of the "It Just Bugs Me!" forum, the favourite whining place of socially awkward aspies and dickfaced faggots:

{{quote|A lot of problems come out of IJBM. Easily half the moderation work. The ugly half, at that. All the mods have talked it over a bit and are in agreement that it is the cause of trouble, not the victim of it. 

The premise is the problem. Asking for bitching gets you bitchiness. 

So here is what we're going to do. Shut it down for real. Shutdown date is Friday, 7 January.|Fast Eddie [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|doing what he does best]]}}

Predictably, the forum descended into a civil war of nerd rage and intolerable whining, divided between pro and anti IJBM factions, with many vowing to [[DO IT FAGGOT|flee the forum immediately]]. A few unimportant ones were banned for rebelling against the mods and being a general retard.

==Google Banned==
Apparently the highest level of ban you can earn on Tv Tropes is called a Google Ban, where instead of redirecting the users to Malware for the lulz or a flashing epileptic GIF of [[Goatse]] that would kill most of the users on sight, they redirect you to http://www.google.com. The reason they do this is because in essence, they are still Google's bitch and are still suckling its nipples for enough funding to host Fast Eddie's site [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=12921861770A31063600&page=0# that he breaks on a regular fucking basis.]

* '''Fast Eddie''' — The founder of the site and its most successful [[troll]] to date. He does not believe in [[free speech]], is mentally [[retarded]], is very [[paranoid]], and, above all, is incredibly [[lazy]]. He's also [[butthurt|not fond of]] words like [[weeaboo]] because they are "[[lol wut|derogatory specifically in a way that is against our]] [[Losers|cross-fandom]]." He claims to be working for a "major videogame producer", which might explain why he [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/archived_discussion.php?s_t=Main.ZeroPunctuation does not like game critics like] [[Yahtzee]] or negative opinions in general, because a game he personally worked on getting a negative review apparently causes him to [[Dying alone|cry himself to sleep at night]]. So much of a pussy that he can and will ban anyone who dares to say a negative thing about his precious pet project.

{{quote|Cut yet another Yahtzee quote. Let me put this as delicately as possible. The guy is a critic. He gets liquored up and cusses about stuff he doesn't like. Couldn't create anything cool himself, so he's going to inflict his mouth on everyone who can.

...

Yahtzee, is that you, you bilious, bloviating bag of batshit? Would it kill you to give another site a reach-around link once in awhile? It turns out one or two members of your audience can actually read. It might give them something to do while you are out scoring meth.

There. That should make him feel welcome.|Fast Eddie on [[Zero Punctuation]]}}

{{quote|Sorry, but we are not about complaints....This is a fan site, dudes. It is about people liking stuff. Not the other thing.|Fast Eddie on complaining}}

* '''Electivirus''' - A faggot nigger who can't talk about anything other than his smelly ass or other guys asses. He also makes many shitty posts that consist of nothing but dumb-ass elipses.  Most famous for his fantasies of riding the meaty yellow cock of [[Pokemon | Electivire]] and mashing the period button for replies, he is best known for threatening to kill himself when the deletion of IJBM was announced: {{quote| This is fucking bullshit! There's no way in hell I am gonna stand for this! You hear me? I love this place, I can't live without it! I need it! If you take it away from me, I would die! I refuse to live without it. Hear this mods, If you dare take away IJBM from me, you'll have one less troper coming online from here on... }}

* '''Chagen46''' - A self-diagnosed schizophrenic little kid with a persecution complex that thinks he is smart as shit but his posts prove otherwise. He also shits himself whenever someone has an opinion that differs from his own. He looks like jar jar binks with dreadlocks and has a diaper fetish like the sick faggot he is. He is also a homophobic bisexual who jerks off to [[lolicon | Touhou]] (then again everyone does on that site) and [[Hypocrite | apparently hates incest people]].

|What is it about diaper fetishism that turns normal people into sly bigots?
Ever since I outed myself, I can't go a single discussion without someone saying some kind of deragatory comment about it. I think I'm the only one on this fora who has been subject to slander against my fetish.
We can have guro fans, macrophiliacs, and fat fetishists, but how fucking dare you have a diaper fetish. Heaven forbid.
Seriously, people, it's a god damn underwear fetish. Now please, someone tell me just what makes a lingerie fetish different from a diaper fetish. They're both underwear fetishes. Yet one is accepted and one isn't.
I'm getting sick of the "creepy" comments. Let me live my life the way I please.|Chagen being the lolcow he is.
|I'm not the most sane or stable person out there.|Duh.
|I'm ''crying'' right now. I'm fucking ''crying'' tears in real life.
Or I would if I could cry anymore.|Surprisingly, nowhere near as emo as most of his posts.
|This post was thumped by the Codfish in a Derby Hat|How most of Chagen's posts end up.
|Not like I need real women anyway. I have my 2D ones. At least they love me.|[[wut]]
|But feeling miserable makes me feel better.|'''''[[wut|WUT]]'''''
|Look god dammit, it was the first time I ever actually gave a shit about somebody besides myself. The first time I fell in love. And it was crushed. Crushed beyond all fucking repair. You don't recover from that. You don't.
You guys are just convincing me to abandon all romance entirely. Which I should. No girl would want a [[asshole|nice guy]] like me anyway.|Keep in mind, he's talking about someone he only knew online.

Now I'm Female Gender/Male Sex for no reason at all.|A hypocritical, self-absorbed, whiny, annoying little fag. In other words, the perfect troper!}}|color=#A46846}}</center>
{{clear}}

* '''AHR''' - A whiny bitch who posts like she's on her period 24/7, goes on long pointless rants, and cusses up a storm thinking it makes her look cool. She's obsessed with FPS games, and wants to get a giant noob tube shoved into her cunt by her transgendered fuck buddy. She tried to call out ED one time, thinking that TV Tropes was superior to that of ED. {{quote | They are just a bunch of neckbeards sitting at their computers talking shit about people. Why pay any mind to them? It's not like anyone reads ED anyway...}}
* '''Anonymous User''' - The most useless poster on the site. 95% of his posts consist of "HURR I KNOW WHO STARTED THIS THREAD". [[Asspie|Is incapable of talking about anything that doesn't have to do with news stations, fonts or buses.]] Is not affiliated with [[Anonymous]] in any shape or form. Biggest waste of a potential trolling username since [[User:Anonymous|our own Anonymous]].
* '''Tnophelia''' Probably the most retarded user on on the site. Admitted to being a cunt from livejournal and a gaiafag, she rages and gets butthurt about being called a troll, and generally is fucking useless and stupid. Her stupidity is so immense she can hypnotize these poor fucks into thinking she's funny. She also made a different account so she could talk to herself to milk her ego and make herself feel important.
* '''Blaze Bullet''' - The horniest and most pathetic user there. He makes threads about how he wants to "FUCK the SHIT" out of girls he sees in school but doesn't have the balls to talk to them. He is also retarded and cannot spell for shit.  He makes numerous alternate accounts to evade his ban just to whine about more bitches he will never get because he is a pathetic loser. Most of the fags that inhabit the site always talk about him, because it's the closest they can get to a troll that will return on a monthly basis, because in all honesty, real trolls have better things to do than waste time on a shitty site that's just as easy to troll as [[YouTube]].
* '''Myrmidon''' - User who does nothing but bitch about trolls and has the dumbest looking avatars of furry animals/humanoids. Wants to ride [[Fag|Tongpu's]] huge, psychotic cock. Treats Joss Whedon like a God and nuzzles his balls whenever he gets the chance.
* '''DYRE''' - The forum pedophile. This is not surprising as he has the mind of a five year old. Beats off to pictures of Yotsuba everyday, and can apparently suck his own dick. Mention how horrible Kodomo No Jikan is even once and he will burst into tears and slit his wrists.
* '''Waltzy''' - Dumbass slut who got peeped on by a bunch of horny motherfuckers because she was too stupid to close her fucking window when she changed into her jammies. The thread she posted about this still exists today but is filled with nothing but spam and trolls trolling trolls as well as lots of huggles and jammies~! >:3 She really really REALLY likes niggers. So much she makes threads about them all of the time. Most likely pregnant by now, spending her free time getting cockslapped by humongous niggers (maybe even a [[double nigger]]) and reading books on how to cook and suck cock at the same time.
* '''Edmania''' - Prick who thinks he is funny with his snarky comments when he is actually the farthest thing from it. Wears noting but avatars of flat chested anime <strike>chicks</strike> "[[Trap|chicks]]". Claims to be asexual to cover up the fact that he wants to fuck little albino boys, or solely for the reason that no girl, retarded or not, would want to fuck him. So he cries on the Forum's ONLY sex topic and tries to belittle others for their sexual experiences (and jerks off silently in the dark to them).
* '''Dark Lady Celebrian''' — Also known as [[Starprincess801]], she has decided to turn to the only online community [[shitty]] enough to handle her delusional, [[retarded]] antics.
* '''Scythemantis''' — The guy who runs [http://bogleech.com this blog.] Very easily irritated, prone to [[Nerd Rage]] at the drop of a hat. A [[Lolcow|low-hanging fruit]], perhaps?
* '''Made Of Meat''' — [[Disregard That I Suck Cocks|Oh nevermind]], she was banned for being a passive-aggressive bitch and now is [[An hero|getting psychological therapy]]. 
* '''DragonQuestV''' — Fag who has no life whatsoever and is constantly bitching and moaning about how he/she/it wants to bring "objectivity" to TV Tropes. Is Fast Eddie's bitch.
[[Image:Nicktheswing-usi.PNG|thumb|right|I'm gonna make lots of money and take down ED! I'll show you all! You'll see!]]
* '''Nick The Swing''' — An [[aspie|aspiring]] fantasy author with petty revenge fantasies of [[taking down ED|buying out ED]] due to being [[butthurt|trolled on YouTube]]. Claims to admire [[Death Note|Light Yagami]] and believes himself to be "[[batshit insane|Ax Crazy]]," which serves to show how much of a [[USI|self-important]] douche he is.
* '''Jisu''' — Stereotypical weeaboo [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/archived_discussion.php?s_t=Main.TokyoMewMew who goes into a spergy fit of rage whenever someone doesn't use names or words that she considers "pure"] on her precious magical girl animu pages and stages personal boycotts of page name changes that she doesn't like.  Also gets mad whenever someone posts evidence that her favorite lesbian pairings aren't canon.  Even other tropers think she's a nutcase who takes things way too seriously.
* '''Rebochan''' - The sum of all [[fantard]]s and a conflict monger that gets off on seeking out controversial pages so he/she can write hostile [[TL;DR]] rants attacking everybody he/she can find. Very easily provoked, only cares about "[[debate|winning debates]]", responds to negative reviews of his/her favorite works with personal tirades, and produces tons of lulz when he/she gets going. The jury's out on whether he/she is a good troll or really is this bitchy; either way, there's great potential for [[lolcow|lulz-milking]].
* '''Fawriel''' - The original designer of Trope-Tan, and somewhat gay furry from [[Finland]]. Was once hit by a car, [[Unwarranted Self Importance|or rather, "headbutted a car"]]. Is still a horrible artist, and is still getting beat up by his parents.
* '''Asalieri''' - A staff member of the [http://thebusystreet.com/ Busy Street blog], who's brave, but [[Banhammer|short-lived]], attempt to speak out against the circle-jerking, self-righteous and oppressive nerds that inhabits the forums, proved that not only is it a bannable offense NOT to be a [[That Guy With The Glasses]] [[fantard]], but that merely presenting and defending a differing opinion is considered both "rude" and "trolling" in the eyes of the Commie [[moderator]]s.
* '''Bioelectricclam''' — best summed up in this quote for the [[Avatar_The_Last_Airbender|Avatar]] movie:

{{Quote|honestly think that we won't be seeing any sequel to the cartoon now. This movie really is that bad. I'm just, right now I am kind of in a state of shock - '''I really loved the cartoon, really really loved it, and seeing it treated in this way is like, to be truthful, it is like watching my sister get raped, or maybe slightly worse.''' At least if my sister was getting raped, I wouldn't have to pay money for it, you know?

Just, God man, why did they let Shyamalan anywhere near the franchise? His movie repertoire is awful, he had no experience with anything like an epic action adventure movie, and frankly he is a bit of an egomaniac who likes to put himself into his movies. So what if his kids were fans of the show? You know what, I am a fan of the show, why can't they make me the freakin' director?! God I just don't even understand things anymore. Let's just hope that Shyamalan's career is over forever, and that maybe they will do an animated movie or something once the negative press dies down./}}

[[tl;dr]] ?

Apparently watching his own [[incest|sister]] get [[raped]] is just as bad as watching the film version of a children's cartoon.

* '''Tongpu''' - One of the site's best trolls (second only to [[USI|Fast Eddie himself]]), specializes in sucking off mass-murderers, buttfucking other tropers using their own blood and creeping everyone the fuck out ("[[Wambulance|Waaaaah, he admires sociopaths! He's so scary! HE'S A TROLL!11]])

* '''Weissritter''' - A Dadfucking nagging bitch who says everything pisses her off and causes her to have Menstrual problems. Too bad she doesn't know that everyone else hates her 100 times more than she hates everyone else. The only thing remotely interesting about her is the [[Virgin|supposed]] [[Lie|hawt lesbian sex]] she has on a daily basis.

* '''Rallyfan[[OVER 9000|9000]]'''- Gun-obsessed military nut who thinks he's hard, but probably never even touched a gun in real life. Is notable for being the whiniest butthurt fag in TVTropes history. He told the wiki that anime was horrible [[Butthurt | and the masses raged against him.]]

* '''Ryal''' - Pissy little faggot former [[Legi0n]]aire who decided to get revenge on the TV Tropes community by- [[Boring|GASP!]]- saying mean things about it [[personal army|on Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. He is totally awesome, and [[Gay|fellates]] twelve [[User:Ryal|virgins]] a week.
