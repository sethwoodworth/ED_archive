'''''Scenario…'''''<br><br>

You and your [[family]] sit together at the dinner table; it is 6 o’clock and you are all prepared for a delightful meal where you will all eat together as a unit and share a relaxing conversation about each other's [[shit nobody cares about|antics and deeds]] from the busy day.  It is a time for rest and it is a time for quiet reflection.  The [[beef]] roast is perfect and mashed potatoes steam slightly in their crockery bowl.  You share a smile with your sister as she hands you the Brussels sprouts.

Suddenly, you and your family are [[Offended|rudely]] and brusquely removed from your calm and quiet time together by the curt jangling of the telephone.  A quick glance at the caller ID delivers you the message that you are being called by 1-202-607-2954 '''“Concerned Women”'''.  Curious, you pick up the [[phone]], wondering just who or what '''Concerned Women''' are and why they might want to call you during such a relaxing time. You bring the phone receiver to your ear and are greeted by mechanical noise resembling static and then the line abruptly disconnects.

You calmly sit back down to your meal and attempt to regain that relieving solace you once had, only to find that the phone call sits on your mind, ruining any comfort you once had…

{{quote|I am on the FUCKING  Do Not Call list. I get at least three calls a day from these assholes who just hang up.|Concerned Telephone Owner}}

202 607 2954 is a wireless phone that calls from the [[Washington, DC]] area. Some searches return an owner of CWA, NRSC, or NO ID, while other searches return a listing as “Concerned Women of America.”  Whatever the case, the entity that owns this phone number is making telephone calls to just about everywhere within the continental United States, and it is doing it several times a day.  After a small amount of digging, the phone number turns out to be used by InfoCision, a telemarketing company, on behalf of Concerned Women for America, a fundamentalist [[Christian]] organization founded by religious crackpot Beverly LaHaye.

If you ask a representative of the CWA about getting more than one call, or if you complain that you are on the national no-call list, they will apologize and state that the auto-dialer must be broken.

===Beverly LaHaye===

[[Image:Concerned Women for America - 22.jpg|thumb|Beverly LaHaye]]

[[Image:Concerned-Women-for-America.jpg|thumb|Tim LaHaye, looking like a marionette, shilling for Mike Huckabee.]]

Beverly LaHaye, who founded the CWA in 1979, is a wacko pro-Christian activist that shovels her shit in both the print media and online. [[Win|Her books deal with keeping women in the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant.]]  She is openly against contraceptive use and wishes to “de-gay” faggots by brainwashing them with a series of straitlaced didactic designed for [[Retards|Sunday School six year olds]].

Beverly also has the honor of being married to Tim Lahaye...Christian minister, author, motivational speaker, and the guy who brought us the stunningly mediocre film [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190524/ ''Left Behind''], which starred another fundy Christian wacko: [[Homosexual|Kirk Cameron]].

Because these two wield such power within the fundamentalist Christian circles, they must be considered crooks and thieves in the same vein as [http://www.answers.com/topic/jim-bakker Jim Baker] and other charlatans of his ilk.

===Concerned Women of America===

{{quote| <small><small>The Concerned Women of America is a women’s rights group based on beliefs founded in Christianity.  They are active in the Pro-Live movement and wish to [[Forced_Meme|promote Biblical values among all citizens]] through prayer, education, and by [[Violence|societal influence]].  They see a massive decline in the moral values of the United States and wish to bring about a change.</small></small>|From my phone call with InfoCision.}}

In a nutshell, they are a [[Fundamentalist|fundy]] extremist group.

What does that have to do with calling you up morning, noon, and night, only to hang up on you right as you answer the telephone?  A lot of people are wondering just that.  Because this not-for-profit ministry was founded by Beverly LaHaye, all this good intention falls to nothing and results in the average person who might be interested in this sort of thing to be bombarded and browbeaten by shrill moralizing through…yes, you guessed it…repeated telephone calls.  As they are non-profit, they are [[Proxy|exempt]] from the no call list and can call you just about any time they want.  Call and complain, they will tell you that their auto-dialer must be malfunctioning, and then they will assure you that you are removed from the list.

Two days later, you will get a call, probably when you are '''WATCHING A YANKEES GAME''', that will be from..."Concerned Women".

===InfoCision===

[[Image:Concerned Women for America - 24.jpg|thumb|Average response to an InfoCision call.]]

[[Image:Concerned Women for America - 29.jpg|thumb|Big bucks and football stadiums...InfoCision.]]

{{quote|Received multiple calls. The one time I spoke to them last month, I told them to take me off the list and they have not done so.|January 30, 2009...and you are still getting calls in June.}}

InfoCision is an [[Ohio]] company founded in the 1970s by Gary Taylor in his garage.  They specialize in working with not-for-profit companies like [[Church|churches]] and lobbyist groups.  Because all of this money is either [http://shop.encyclopediadramatica.com/collections/frontpage/products/ed-typeface-logo-shirt donated or given freely] by the government, [[Nobody|everybody]] is responsible for Taylor’s success and for those annoying telephone calls you get all the time.

InfoCision’s involvement with the CWA is as a paid freelance contractor used to make phone calls on their behalf.  Because the CWA is a not-for-profit organization, they are not on any current national no-call list.  InfoCision uses this fact to its [[Money|advantage]] by repeatedly ignoring any lists, complaints or requests for removal from the national No Call list.  

By calling InfoCision, I was able to reach Sal Varsalone, a customer care specialist who deals with people who actually call back the number 1-202-607-2954 “Concerned Women”. Sal explained to me that InfoCision receives money from the CWA and that is how the workers at InfoCision are paid.  Sal went to some length to explain to me that this was all done by [http://shop.encyclopediadramatica.com/ anonymous contributions and donations,] but did not wish to discuss any sort of money donated by political action groups or lobbyists.  At that point I was given the number for the CWA’s Washington, DC office (1-202-488-7000) and told to call during normal business hours.

Don't think this stuff can add up to big bucks? InfoCision just paid for a brand new stadium on the [[College|University of Akron's main campus in Akron]]. The total bill was 55 million dollars and now the Akron Zips have a shiny new stadium to play in. It should be noted that the stadium is currently hemorrhaging money, due partly in fact to the wise Akron personnel leaving the lights on all night, just in case anyone within a two mile radius wanted to sleep.

==How Can a For-Profit Company Be Tax Exempt?==

[[Image:Concerned Women for America - 20.jpg|thumb|[[batshit|Wendy Wright]], President of CWA.]]

{{quote|By taking and mixing the two most annoying things on the planet, fundamentalist Christians and telemarketers, the CWA has increased revenue several hundred fold. Also, they are pestering the hell out of their own base with little or no regard for the law...why are they allowed to do this?|A detractor of the CWA and their tactics.}}

Simple, have two companies.  The CWA is both a 501C3 ministry (which is totally tax exempt) and a 527 lobbyist group (which is a political action group funded by corporations and the federal government) at the same time. 
 
A '''501C3''' is a group founded for Religious, Educational, Charitable, Scientific, Literary, Testing for Public Safety, to Foster National or International Amateur Sports Competition, or Prevention of Cruelty to Children or Animals organization.  By being a 501C3, the CWA is exempt from taxation by the United States federal government.  

A '''527''' is also a tax-exempt organization utilized to influence the nomination and election of candidates.  They are also involved in swaying public opinion to attempt to change laws or strengthen currently existing laws.  They are funded by political action groups that are paid for directly by corporations and even lowly tax payers who wish to donate, but they also get funding directly from the federal government.

This is where this all gets really fun.  Since the 202 607 2954 number calls out to people all the time, you can expect that there are several complaints about the number on various “what number is this?” call sites all over the web.

==A Troll?==

[[Image:Concerned Women for America - 21.gif|thumb|CWA lunatics protesting something...probably something fun.]]

There is some conjecture that various Pro-Choice groups are using the “Concerned Women” ID tied to the telephone number in an attempt to annoy the American public into hating Christian groups by calling at odd  hours and several times a day.  This is not the truth.  Through telephone calls to several CWA offices, ED has been assured that they (the CWA) are the people responsible for the calls, and thus they are the people who are creating the anger.  So, if you have somebody you would like to complain to, direct all of your rage, vitriol, and hate at the CWA, not some tree hugging hippy Wook group that likes pro-choice.
