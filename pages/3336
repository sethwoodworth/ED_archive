Ginger Genocide
[[Image:MIA-sharkshirt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|As you can see, she is [[India|a wog]] from [[Britain]].]]

We all know that [[gingers]] are mutants who must be eliminated from the human gene pool. Exhibiting the traditional tolerance that [[Muslims]] are famed for, [[British]] singer M.I.A. (real name Maya Arulpragasam) released a video for her single ''Born Free'' on [[Jewtube]].

The video itself depicts a [[Genocide|paramilitary roundup]] and mass execution of [[redhead]]s. Under the absurd rationale that this constitutes [[offensive]] content, Jewtube deleted it. Initiating the [[Streisand Effect]], this generated an assload of [[attention]] for M.I.A.'s mediocre career.

When people were asked why they were offended by M.I.A's brilliant new video, they didn't mention the gingers who were lined up and shot or the extreme [[violence]], [[lolwut|just the negative depiction of the US flag]]. When asked, Jew said, "M.I.A. is a provocateur and someone who tries to [[Troll|rile people up]] in a variety of ways. Yes, it's [[Metal|brutal]] and at times a bit overly [[drama]]tic, but it's also a form of [[Trolling IRL|political protest]], [[USI|a downright subversive bit of art]] created by [[Bullshit|an artist]] on a major label, Interscope."

One has to wonder exactly what she was protesting.
