Advocacy
[[Image:Avocado2.jpg|thumb|Advocacy can take many forms.]]

Advocacy is a kind of singularly dull, perpetual [[flame war]] carried on exclusively by [[nerd]]s.

It all starts when a nerd extends their sense of self to encompass their favourite [[operating system]], [[programming language]], [[open source]] license, or anything else they have may have developed a certain strong digital addiction to.  Because the nerd's sense of self is involved, advocacy is, in fact, a particularly [[retard]]ed form of [[shameless self-promotion]].

Once their ego is firmly attached to their chosen [[fetish]] XYZ, an advocate lies in wait until the subject of XYZ comes up on an unrelated or distantly related [[Internets]] [[forum]], [[newsgroup]], or [[mailing list]].  Only at such a point will they begin to actively advocate XYZ.  Beginning with what they consider to be eminently [[logic|rational]] arguments for why XYZ is [[teh]] [[g00dz]], they progress through various stages of persuasion: benchmarks, anecdotes, opining, rhetoric, sophistry, [[ad hominem]]s, whining, and finally [[quitting IRC forever|quitting XYZ forever]].

While the internal [[drama]] level of advocacy is very high, the external yield is nearly nil, since XYZ is inevitably a piece of [[shit]] anyway.

History does not record a single person changing their mind due to exposure to advocacy on any subject whatsoever.
