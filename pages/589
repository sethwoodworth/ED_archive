Arcades are places you used to go when you didn't own a [[Sega Genesis]] or a [[SNES]]. Or you were sick of playing shitty arcade ports on your [[Atari]] 2600. All of them are currently dead, since the invention of arcade quality graphics on consoles. The only arcades left open are ones with [[DDR]], Guitar Freaks, driving games, dumbass horsey rides, or maybe the newest House of the Dead, which, incidentally, is also a pretty good description of any arcade you can name. Of course, you can probably play ''[[Spiderman|Marvel]] vs. [[Capcom]]'', but really, go fuck yourself if you contemplated that.  

Of course, you can always go play some games at the world famous Pac-Man Arcade in Pasadena, California...wait a minute, there's ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' in the Pac-Man arcade? Oh fuck you internet, FUCK YOU! They're urinating on [[Nolan Bushnell]]'s grave, and he is not even dead!

Arcade machines are those big pieces of shit that were probably the first portable game systems evar... if you had a generator. Games were usually twenty five cents, Dragon's Lair was the first FMV game and the first game to charge fifty cents. Most arcade machines today have blank screens, [[masturbation|sticky buttons, sticky joysticks]], broken buttons, etc. They're just a mess. Usually, the only functioning arcade machine is ''Marvel vs. Capcom 2''.

All arcade games after the mid 90's sucked, other than ''[[Metal Slug]]'', which of course, everyone loves. 

Of course it really doesn't matter now with the creation of MAME.

==List of Popular Arcade Games==
*[[Super Mario Bros.]]
*Super [[Street Fighter 2]] Rainbow Champion Turbo EX Plus: The Ultimate New Challenger Zangeif (The Alpha Fury Edition: Hyper Turbo)
*[[Mortal Kombat]]
*[[win|Dragon's Lair]]
*Galaga: No matter how many enemies you kill, more are sent.  There is no way to "win" the game.  A chilling referendum on the war in Iraq and the first example of games as art.
*Gradius: Pissed gamers off because acquiring all upgrades was a fucking bitch. [[an hero|The player dies by a stray bullet]] and is forced to gather the upgrades again.
*[[Space invaders|Space Invaders]]
*[[Is_this_Battletoads|Battle Toads]]
*Double Dragon II
*Contra: Every weapon besides the spreadshot sucked ass. No one used the laser because it got you killed more than it helped you.  The basic plot involves [[Lost|a couple of fags trying to get to the heart of an island and destroy it]].  Neither of them brought shirts.  It was [[ghey|the 80's]].
*Marvel vs. [[Capcom]] 2
*[[Simpsons]]
*Pulstar: R-Type knock-off by SNK. It was ripped-off to the point that most gamers considered it to be an unofficial remake of R-Type.
*Final Fight
*R-Type: Famous for making arcade gamers suffer from anger problems the rest of their lives.
*[[Soul Calibur]]
*[[Bad Dudes]] vs Dragon Ninja
*Initial D: usually surrounded by [[azn]] gangs that think its [[serious business]].  The most fun to be had is in trying to puzzle out [[My Tiny Dick|what the D is an initial of]].
