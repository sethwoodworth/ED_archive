On Monday, November 1, 2010, the San Francisco Giants won the world series against the Texas Rangers, bringing San Francisco its first-ever World Series win.  In jubilation, the [[gay|residents]] [[stoner|of]] black person ran into the streets to show their appreciation to the team.  They did so by overturning buses, shooting each other, burning things, and taking over a donut shop.  The Giants Riot has the honor of being the first riot in world history to be organized (as well as a riot can be) through social networks.  People were checking into the riot on Foursquare and "#sfriot" was a top hashtag on [[Twitter]].  Flickr had a photo pool, and a [http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~starbird/aux_map.html tweetmap was made].  [[old media|Actual news]] ignored the riot until the next morning, so the only way to get information was on Twitter and through an online feed of the SF police scanner.

==Happy Donut==

Several hours into the riot, radio traffic on the emergency bands started to center around a donut shop / Chinese restaurant called Happy Donut.  The police repeatedly had to break up fights in the area but were beginning to be attacked themselves as rioters threw beer bottles on them from Happy Donuts.  The donut shop had essentially been captured by the mob, and the police were beginning to worry, as evidenced by the distraught calls to Southern Command.  After some time, the police managed to assemble a platoon-sized assault squad (augmented by borrowed police from San Mateo) and storm the donut shop.  After heavy fighting, Happy Donuts was retaken and the bear claws and cheap coffee were secured to resupply the SFPD.

==Prop 19==

On Twitter, concerns were expressed by the rioters that they might have a hard time waking up in the morning to vote.  Why that is significant is that on the ballot was Proposition 19, the proposition to legalize marijuana for all users over 21 in California.  [[hipsters|Those participating in the riots]] were an important part of the effort to pass the law.  

The Twitter users' worries proved well-founded.  Proposition 19 failed 45-55 in the general election.  If only the hipsters had been well-rested, they might have passed the bill.  Instead, they were sleeping off the soreness of being beaten by police.

Understandably, the [[police]] were quite stressed.  There weren't enough police to go around, rioters were throwing bottles at them, they were being shot at, Happy Donut was occupied by rioter scum, their cars were getting broken into, and their assault rifles were getting stolen.  The harried dispatchers decided to allow "justifiable use of force," which is demonstrated in the photograph at right.

This riot was the world's first riot to be organized (insofar as a riot can be) via social networks.  #sfriots was the top hashtag on Twitter during the riots, and rioters checked in through Foursquare.  Yes, Foursquare.  The Giants Riot had a Mayor.  Videos made it to YouTube and pictures made it to Flickr before the riot was even half over, thanks to 3G internet on smartphones.  A few hours into the night, [http://www.sfriots.com/ an official website had been created].    

Here, we see a fight break out in a McDonald's during the riot.  This particular fight happened because some [[sheneequa|lady]] cussed in front of some other chick's niglet.  Everything fell apart as the rioters began to beat each other and record videos on their phones.
