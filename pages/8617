Plenty of [[sick fuck]]s abuse and slaughter [[cat]]s. [[Kenny Glenn|Some knock them around for fun]], while other subhumans prefer to murder them in [[Camrose Cat Killers|microwaves]] and [[Cheyenne Cherry|stoves]]. A contender for the  (alleged) ultimate high score in feline slaughter is '''Tyler Weinman''', a creepy little suburbanite who was accused of mutilating and killing over a dozen cats prior to his recent arrest and exoneration.

==Details==
Weinman's parents are divorced, he likes dogs, and he [[douche|acts like an innocent angel]] in an attempt to conceal his smartass [[Fursona|persona]]. His standard M.O. is to gut and crush the skulls of his victims, and conveniently leave them on the front yards of their owners. He's also found the time to gouge out the eyes and cut off the snout of one of his earlier targets.

[[Some argue|Experts speculate]] that his hatred of cats may be a result of being [[Rape|raepd]] by [[Furry|furries]] at an early age.

==BUSTED, FGT==
In a lame attempt to appear innocent, Tyler joined a [[Failbook]] group devoted to catching him, which retroactively served to draw more attention to him. Undercover [[police]] arrested him during a party on his prom night, booked him while he was still wearing his [[fag]]goty tuxedo and made him miss his dance.

==Out On Bond==

For [[Incest|whatever reason]], a whopping $249,000 was collected to pay Tyler's bail. However, police have recovered knives and [[cutting]] tools hidden in his room that will be tested for kitty DNA, and with the use of a GPA device, have also determined that Tyler's car was near the scenes of the crimes around the times that they occurred, [[Fail|which he has desperately denied]]. The [[cops|piggies]] have also found [[Philip Markoff|scratches on his body]] that might have been inflicted by his victims.

==WHOOPS==
[[Image:TyleryoulittlePRICK.jpg|thumb|right|Have you ever wanted to punch something as much as this in your whole life?]]

According to numerous [[Fisting|investigating]] officers who have no reason to jeopardize their careers by lying, [[Fail|Weinman twice alluded to an admission while trying to make a deal with them]].[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami-dade/story/1163383.html]

{{quote|OK, so let me see if I understand. As long as I tell you about the cats that I did, you can get rid of the others?|[[Idiot|Tyler]], having not yet struck a deal}}

== /b/'s Reaction ==

[[Image:Scaredkitten.jpg|thumb|right|"Is it safe to come out yet?"]]

[[Image:TylerW.jpg|thumb|right|AWWWWW, SOMEBODY HAS A BOO-BOO ON HIS WIDDLE NODE]]

{{quote|If they catch him, they're probably going to give him 2 months in jail (if even) then set him out again on maybe like a $50 charge. AS WITH ALL ANIMAL ABUSE CASES. Fucking laws. All animal abusers should be put to death, simple as that.|Anon telling it like it is.}}

{{quote|Kill him first. Then if the murders continue, find another anti-social teenager to kill. Repeat.
Problem solved.|Rinse, lather, repeat.}}

{{quote|I hope you all get accused of a crime you did not commit one day.

This kid has not been convicted and the news articles offer no proof linking him to it.

Police often get the wrong guy just so they can product some sort of result for the case.

But keep up the attitude of "well he was accused so he must be guilty". When it's your turn, others will do the same to you.|[[Some argue|Sources say]] this user might be the real killer.}}

== Free the Cat Killer ==

To make matters more interesting, Tyler's butt-buddies, local sluts, and [[Your Mom|mom]] have established a [[Facebook]] group asserting his innocence. According to them, he's the [[OJ Simpson]] of cat killers, and must be innocent. The members of this group are reported to hate cats, and more notably tend to fap to [[Furry art|pictures of dogs]].

== Exonerated ==

On the 26th of November, 2010, Tyler was [http://www.wsvn.com/news/articles/local/21002833080096/ cleared of all charges against him]. According to Miami [[Old media|local news]], the State Attorney's Office dropped all charges when "Medical testimony determined the cats were killed by predatory animals and not a human being." Apparently, these predatory animals are heartless monsters who can cut open animals with surgical precision and leave them in their owners' front lawns on 19 separate occasions. Here [[you]] were, thinking that the only monsters in Miami are [[Jews]].
