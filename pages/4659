Kung Fu

Kung Fu is a method of self defense invented by the [[azn|azns]] to keep foreign countries from invading for their rice.  Kung Fu is inherited genetically and cannot be mastered by any other race, aside from the occasional black person. [[IRL]] Kung Fu has never worked. Ever. This is due to bullets having the ability to go through skin, and the contrary being impossible.  [[Anime]] Kung Fu wouldn't work either if more people carried guns and weren't [[fucktarded]] enough to fight more experienced [[azn|azns]] unarmed.

==Kung Fu Styles==
There are many styles of Kung Fu, most of which were [[furry|ripped off from animals]]. Being the sick, demented fucks they are, [[furfags]] often claim that because kung fu masters practiced animal forms, they are also furries in the "spiritual" sense.

[[At least 100 years ago|In the 70's]] there was a popular television show called Kung Fu. The main star was [[David Carradine]], a [[white man]] without [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowface one asian drop of blood in his entire body]. The show was originally written by [[superior|Bruce Lee]] but the producers said he was too chinky to be on TV and decided to pull an [[Eric Bauman]] by taking his notes and cast some random drunk guy, who happens to be David Carradine, and cast him as a [[lol wut|half-asian]] that knows Kung Fu, despite the fact that Carradine can't even fight for shit to save himself from 5 year olds; in his favor, he recently took a good, hard, look at himself and [[AnHero| acted accordingly]].
