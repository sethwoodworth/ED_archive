Taken from the novel ''[[1984]]'' by George Orwell, '''Big Brother''' is the imaginary, omniscient and supposedly benevolent figurehead of the [[Stalinesque]] totalitarian regime governing [[Australia|Oceania]]. Nowadays, the term Big Brother is applied to the [[United States]] government because they are supposedly watching us all the time. It is also used liberally whenever anyone, anywhere mentions technology, example
<s>Fuckhead: Cameras are really powerful these days
Fucktit: Yeah, if we don't monitor them we'll have Big Brother watching us.
Fuckhead: o rly?
Fucktit: ya rly. 
Fuckhead: NO WAI!</s> 
[[DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS]]!!!

The above exchange is not funny. Our apologies.

[[Liberals]] like to say [[George W. Bush]] is Big Brother, but that's bullshit. Bush is too stupid to be as powerful and all-seeing as Big Brother, and besides, Big Brother was supposed to be benevolent.

More importantly, Big Brother is a reality [[Television|TV]] show based on the life and death of [[Scientology|L. Ron Hubbard]]. A bunch of no-life [[dickhead]]s volunteer to live in a house and be taped 24/7 doing [[pegging|embarassing things]] such as taking it [[in the ass]] and [[rape|raping]] each other. Contrary to popular belief, the show's inhabitants are genuine human beings. This fact, however, remains in dispute. Everyone from the past series' of the show are now either dead or working as internet [[pedophile]] [[basement dwellers]] pretending to be [[16 year old girl|16 year old girls]].

In the 2006 season of Aussie Big Brother, a slutty whore went over to the bed of two men. Whilst on it, they held her down and one member slapped her in the face with his penis. The "Turkey Slapping" incident caused a huge uproar across the state and the Prime Minister John Howard (the one who takes it up the ass from George Bush) asked for the show to be removed.

Big Brother was let off on a technicality; the incident was shown on the 24/7 live cameras on the BB website, and everybody knows there aren't many laws for internet stuff. Except [[pedophilia]] and possibly [[rape|rape porn]].
All in all, the only people who saw it were a bunch of  [[13 year old boys|weirdo freak losers]]
who just happened to be watching a shitty mindless show at 2AM. 

==UK 2007 Celebrity BB==

In the UK 2007 celebrity BB, <s>the [[Old_media|Sky news group]]</s> everybody in the UK [[drama|accused]] a disgusting, fat, hideously un-classy beast(a.k.a [[Jade Goody]]) of racism against an [[India|Indian]] ([http://www.shilpa-shetty.com Shilpa Shetty]) which reached international [[drama|news]] status and had the British Prime Minister [[pwned|apologise]] to the Indian [[Pakistan|Prime Minister]]. [[Asking for it|Incidentally, as of 2009, Jade "Cocksucking" Goody is dying of terminal cancer.|]] 

The rest of the country found themselves in a moral dilemma:  Who should get the brunt of their hatred? The terminally (ill) uneducated Jade Goody, or the hawt (but foreign) Shilpa Shetty.  The answer proved that the British are far more snobby than they will ever be racist (as long as the foreigner has good tits).

However, in [[India]], a woman carrying a child of mixed nationality would be [[fire|burnt]] alive by the parents should they find out.

Please, while you're there in [[Europe|"Yurop"]], point out that the English are now so politically correct that they will not even protect themselves against being falsely accused of racism, just incase it could be seen as racism. However, since the three making the "racist" remarks were [[fat girl angle shot|fat]], [[tranny|transgendered]] and [[ugly|a Miss England]], the media were looking for an [[troll|excuse]] to ruin their careers and get even [[moar|moar]] money from their "[[Shit nobody cares about|exclusive stories]]" and [[lulz|lulz]].

==Big Brother Africa==
THIS IS AFRICAAAA!

==Australian Big Brother==
As of at least 100 years ago, Australia stole Big Brother. Some whore got turkey slapped one time, and people lolled. The bitch was asking for it,  this was [[Josef Fritzl|Josef Fritzl's idea]]. Originally he was going to write in his daughter and himself but got rejected when 10 found out that he was not making it a mudkip. She also got compensation after the show ended
, the 2 guys raped her and she finally got what she wanted. Last thursday, [[Corey Worthington|Corey Faggoton]] has decided to join Big Brother Australia.  This was like dropping [[EFG]] in a [[Tom Cruise|Faggot's]] house. He got assraped by the crowd, booing until the faggot left the compound. Noone has yet to kill him. On monday the 21st, this fucking shitty show was finally axed as the show had [[shit]] ratings.

== الرئيس ==
They tried to do a Big Brother in arbabia, but because the show had men and women together it got [[Pwnd|banned]]. The [[terrorists|muslims]] are scum.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3522897.stm]
