[[File:Adrian Chen Spelling Bee.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[You]] wish you could be this cool.]]
'''Adrian Chen''' (aka [[Gay]]drian Chen) is yet another classy member of the [[Gawker]] [[paparazzi]] [[Faux News|blogger squad]].  [[IRL]], Adrian's a [[AZN|half-breed]] dwarf fresh out of [[University_of_Phoenix|community college]] whose buckin' for one serious [[blowjob|promotion]] from [[Jew-ish|Nick Denton]].  Chen fell in with the Gawker crowd some time ago and has been refining his [[attention whoring]] and [[jew gold]]-rearing techniques with surgical precision lately, most recently during a proudly touted "[[flame war|e-war]]" with [[*chan]] he and fellow blogger Ryan Tate declared on behalf of Gawker Media as a [[lulzy]] response to the thousands loling at their [[white knighting]] and [[internet humanitarianism]] over [[Jessi Slaughter]].  

Oh, he's also an [[Unrealistic expectations|aspiring filmmaker]]:

[[File:Adrian_Chen.png|thumb|right|250px|"o hay guise, can I be [[white]] too?"]] 
So, during Chen's self-imposed crash-course in [[A Scientologist's Guide to 4chan|*chan 101]] he seems to have taken Anon's [[bawww|words to heart]] despite his [[failures|tactics]] being pretty self-evident to even the newest of new.  Some things are becoming increasingly clear, though, and he began to reveal some things about himself: 

1) Is perhaps the most [[trying too hard|obsequious ass kisser]] on the entire Gawker [[circle jerk|blogger squad]] (Ryan Tate [[mantrain|second in-line]]).  Seems willing to subject himself to almost anything to [[SSP|get ahead]], and would probably jump at the chance to give Nick Denton a [[COCK|reach-a-round]] for some scraps from the table.  

2) A younger, slightly more internet-saavy (and [[azn]]) version of [[Parry Aftab]] in the making.  Was probably the kid who'd have happily [[snitch]]ed you out in [[high school]] for cribbing in the hopes it would get him good letters of rec from the principle so he could major in "[[Faggotry|Journalism]]" at some [[shit]] school.  He calls this [[failing|trolling]], of course.

3) Can someone be [[butthurt]], [[white knighting]] AND scheming for [[jew gold]]s all at the same time? [[¯\(°_o)/¯]]

==Chen's [[Anon|Current Obsession]]==
In an elaborate ploy to get in good with Denton and farm pageviews, Chen attempted (and is still attempting to) make [[B|/b/]] [[RAGE]] with his coverage of Ebaums's raid on [[Jessi_Slaughter|"Kerligirl13"/Jessi Slaughter/Jessica Leonhardt]] and [[Blood on the Dance Floor|her favorite faggot band]].  While [[I|/i/]]nsurgents and [[BRILLIANT!|Gawker commenters]] alike quickly deduced this [[jew gold|self-serving chink's plot]], a small number of clueless retards started threads [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|urging DDOS]] of Gawker and, predictably, a raid on Chen himself.  Gawker contributors, hoping for some trifles from Denton's bottomless coffers of jewgolds, greedily screencapped these [[cancer]]ous posts and re-published them as evidence of a /b/-Gawker "feud".  Of course, in doing so they ignored the replies of the majority of [[/b/tard|/b/tards]] who, in a display of uncharacteristic wisdom, [[sage]]d the cancer and disregarded Chen's attention-whoring.  Gawker continues to milk this non-incident, portraying itself as a muckraking martyr standing strong against [[cyberbully|cyber-bullies]] (faggotry has been screencapped to avoid linking):

As long as you continue to click on these posts and rage over them, Gawker and the [[blogger]]s themselves will collect money.  During the week of July 17th [[2010]], Adrian Chen alone is estimated to have made about $6,000 just based on page-views...many of those pageviews attributable to /b/:
