Visions

'''''Visions''''' is a [[Christian]] [[MMORPG]]. It was discovered by [[EQ2Flames]] users in December of 2009. The game isn't even being developed by actual game developers, unless "Heaven's Blessings Tiny Zoo" is an actual company, or Laurene Wells is like, the [[Smed]] of it. In fact, of their total goal on their [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1799801709/visions-a-christian-MMORPG profile, they have obtained <font size=5>$107 out of $58,692</font> by their deadline]. Actually, the game looks like ''[[Darkfall]]'' except worse. So they should probably win an award for that [[lulz|feat]]. <sub>And ''[[Darkfall]]'' actually released...</sub>

It's also worth noting (and [[funny]]) because a devout [[Catholic]] game developer, [[Brad McQuaid]], referred to [[Vanguard|the perfect MMO]] as ''The Vision''.

Fuck it, it's the [[Aion|WoW killer]].

{{quote|Where most other online games have the play character kill a never ending hoard of enemies to gain experience and purchase levels from a trainer, Visions will have play characters learn their skills by completing quests, and then use their skills to improve their ability that skill. The skills they use the most will be the skills they are best at.|The developers, on the game being [[Darkfall|yet another "skill-based" game]];}}

''Visions'' is supposed to be a first-person [[MMORPG]], except without the whole [[FPS]] stuff. Maybe you can be like David and have a slingshot to shoot down [[D&D|giants]] or something. The plot takes place in about 100 A.D. during the times of [[Weev|Emperor Trajan]]. Over time new emperors will [[boner|rise]] to the [[toilet|throne]] and new [[EverQuest|quests]] will appear.

There are are fuckton of classes (but not as much as ''[[EQ2]]''), separated into [[deviantArt|crafters]] (bakers and shit), outdoorsmen such as [[Farm Town|ranchers]], physical classes like [[Oh no you didn't|mercenaries]], and scholastic classes (like an entertainer. [[Whore|How]] the entertainer entertains is never mentioned.)

There are also supposed to be classes based on scriptures...aptly named "Scripture Quests". Too bad, due to the game's lore, there isn't anything like [[Lol|nail Jesus to the cross for 100 XP]] or almost sacrifice your son to [[God]] to prove your faith.

The page claims that the cash would have gone to office supplies, [[MS Paint|software used for developing]], marketing, and street preachers. Since there's been nothing suggesting [[Tabula Rasa|the project ending completely]], one can only assume that it's still going. The plan to release this in March 2010. Uh-huh. [[Aventurine]], what say you?

They also plan to use their own money for...
