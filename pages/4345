JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
[[Image:Araki.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The creator of JoJo's, [[fag|Hirohiko Araki]] at age 84.]] 

'''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure''' is a [[manga|mango]] created by some [[Azn|Azn]] named [[Fag|Hirohiko Araki]] because he had nothing better to do [[At least 100 years ago|sometime in the 1980s]]. This series is famous for [[Za Warudo|Dio Brando]]. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is Shounen Jump's second longest-running manga ever, and because it is the origin of [[za warudo|two]] [[WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY|memes]], it is the only good [[manga|animu]] to have ever been created. No exceptions.

==Plot==
[[Image:FUCK.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[WTF|An average scene in JoJo’s]].]]

There are seven storyline arcs in JoJo's, because Araki has [[ADHD]]. These arcs are:

*Phantom Blood
*Battle Tendency
*Stardust Crusaders
*Diamond is Unbreakable
*Vento Aureo
*Stone Ocean
*Steel Ball Run

The main plot of JoJo's in each arc is basically a descendant of the Joestar bloodline [[rage|pissing off]] Dio in some manner. No, really. The plots of each arc are basically about pissing off:
   
*Vampire Dio
*Vampires LIKE Dio
*[[Moar|Moar]] Vampire Dio
*People with supar powers because of vampire Dio
*Vampire Dio's son
*Father Bootylicious (Dio's [[buttsecks|bff]]) and one of Vampire Dio's bones.
*[[Raptor Jesus|Dinosaur Dio]]

At the end of pissing everybody off, the JoJo of the arc usually dies, or [[pregnant|has babies]]. Or both. Nobody really cares about any of the arcs other than Stardust Crusaders, because life doesn't get any better than vampires that can [[Za Warudo|stop time]] and [[WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY|drop fucking steamrollers on people]].

==Characters==
All the characters are [[bullshit|well-designed and realistic]]. The protagonist of each arc [[I See What You Did There|always has the term "Jo" somewhere in his/her name twice]]. Other characters are generally named after singers or bands, Italian food, or fashion companies. Sooner or later, they're going to be named them after [[memes]]. Sometimes though, Araki decides to be a normal [[Azn]] and make their names [[Wapanese|Japanese]].
The main characters for each arc are as follows:

[[Image:C-Moon Bootylicious.jpg|thumb|right|100px|<s>Father Pucci's</s> Father Bootylicious's stand, C-Moon.]]

*'''Jonathan Joestar''' - Basically the [[OP]] of all the JoJos. [[Shit nobody cares about|No one cares about him]] because he got [[pwned]] by Dio.
*'''Robert E.O. Speedwagon''' - Once threw a hat at Johnathan and became his BFF after Johnathan beats the shit out of him. Later on, all he really does for the rest of the series is shit himself when something scary happens. Araki then subsequently trolls the audience in every other installment of the series by [[u mad|murdering]] a Speedwagon descendant in each of them.
*'''Dio Brando''' - The first troll in the series. He one day decides to troll Johnathan until he gets trolled himself. Since he doesn't want to appear butthurt, he turns himself into a vampire and trolls the Joestar family even after he's dead. Unfortunately, faggots are diluting his badassness by using "WRYYYY" as much as they quote Family Guy.
*'''Joseph Joestar''' - Usually regarded by [[fans]] as [[No|the rough equivalent of Chuck Norris]]. Reappears again in the 3rd and 4th series as an [[old]] faggot with a stand that lets him [[tentacle rape]]. He is also well known for having the power of [[mindfuck|predicting what other people are about to say]].
*'''Jotaro Kujo''' - The Jojo who started the whole trend with stands in his arc. He's supposedly 17 when he's first introduced in the 3rd arc, but apparently [[wtf|looks like he's in his 30s]], and every series he reappears in afterwards, [[lol wut|he looks younger]]. [[Fangirls]] often make up [[shit|fanart and/or fanfics]] about him having [[sex]] with his buttbuddy, [[fag|Kakyoin]]. Kills Dio with a [[Falcon Punch]] at the end of the 3rd series. His stand is a blue she-male called Star Platinum that can fist at the speed of light.
*'''Josuke Higashikata''' - Elvis Presley wannabe (his hair is a fucking pompadour) with money instincts of a Jew, which makes him the [[lame|coolest JoJo out of all]]. He is apparently known for [[rage|flipping the shit on anyone who makes fun of his ridiculous hair]]. His stand can fix shit and is also the biggest [[pussy]] because he's the only Jojo who doesn't have the balls to actually [[pwn|kill]] anyone. Though to be fair, he did turn someone that pissed him off into a living toilet, which counts for something I guess.
*'''Giorno Giovanna''' - Dio's bastard child, which let him inherit some of Dio's [[win]]. Started out looking like a typical [[azn]], but as he grew stronger, [[DBZ|his hair turned yellow and his eyes became blue]]. His first stand was a weak piss-yellow bitch that did nothing but grow trees, but after it got stabbed by a magical [[penis|arrow]] it gained the ability to [[divide by zero]].
*'''Jolyne Kujo''' - Was starred as the main [[whore|heroine]] in the 6th series as a short break from the meat train of [[gay|male]] JoJos, but due to his [[faggotry]], [[fag|Araki]] drew her like a [[shemale|man]]. Her stand is made of silly string.
*'''Johnny Joestar/Gyro Zeppeli''' Imagine Johnathan and Will from the first Jojo and make them 10 times gayer. Nobody gives a fuck about Johhny, he's a cripple who [[fag|shoots his nails at people]]. And Gyro is a [[gay]] cowboy. Obviously these two were created after [[fag|Araki]] watched Brokeback Mountain one too many times.

==Stands==
Stands are the physical manifestation of whatever super power each JoJo's character has. They first appeared in part three, and were named based on color and any given tarot card. Later Araki got fucking lazy and decided to name them after songs/bands. It can be noted that Araki is lazy and every final boss has a stand with some sort of time ability. At least 80% of these make no fucking sense without a tl;dr explanation. The most recent involves speeding up time so fucking fast the universe resets. In the meanwhile, living things don't get sped up, leading to getting pwnd by things as simple as automatic doors.
