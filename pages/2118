'''''Dead Space''''' is a <s>survival</s> action-horror video game that requires the player to not only kill the enemies, but [[rip and tear|literally rip the enemies to pieces]] creating beautiful bloodbaths. This game was a surprise to everyone since the game's developer, [[EA]], makes all of their games with no gore in them. EA was [[Derp|clever]] enough to put some [[Lulz|dark humor]] into the game, but most of the [[people]] that bought the game did not understand this type of humor. Therefore, the dark humor was somewhat of a [[fail]]ure in the game. Some gamers were irritated at the fact that that the game was either [[Lol wut|too short]], [[Retard|the puzzles were too hard]], [[Left 4 Dead|the gore was repetitive]], or too scary (even though it wasn't at all). Fortunately, there was always a troll on any review website that put them in their place.

==Storyline==

[[Image:DeadSpace_VaginaMonster.jpg|thumb|Damn straight that's a [[vagina]] monster. The final form of goatse.]]


The story starts off with the player as Isaac, an engineer sent to investigate and [[Fixed|repair]] the [[Japan|''Ishimura'']], the ship that the player will be running [[Metallica|frantically]] through throughout [[The game|the whole game]]. Isaac and his crew, Zach Hammond (who DIES) and Kendra Daniels (who ALSO DIES), Johnston and Chen (who DIE), exit the wormhole in their ship the "Kellion" and see how badly the ''Ishimura'' was raped. The [[Rape Clock|rape meter]] detects high levels of [[rape]] on the ''Ishimura'' and, like fucktards, they decide to board the ship. Isaac is also there to find his [[Girlfriend|bitch]], Nicole Brennan (who WAS ALREADY DEAD). While traveling into the [[butthole]] of the Ishimura, the Kellion goes out of control and crashes into the docking bay.

[[Image:Markers_everywhere.jpg|thumb|plot summary.]]

After this event happens, Isaac, Zach, Kendra, Chen, and Johnston [[Miracle|miraculously]] get out of the ship without any wounds. As they run into the lounge of the ship, the whole place turns into a [[shithole]] (as if it wasn't already) and all hell breaks loose. Isaac stands and watches through a window as his crew is attacked by creatures and Chen and Johnston are killed. Isaac has to run his unarmed ass out of there and go into an unstable elevator, then acquire's a fucking futuristic staple gun that is horrible at killing enemies.  Later on, Isaac meets up with [[Scientology|Unitologists]] who are [[Insane|batshit insane]] over the [[Dianetics|Marker]] which caused all of the shit on the ship to happen in the first place.  One of the Unitologists, [[L. Ron Hubbard|Dr. Challus Mercer]] (FUCKING DIES), releases his "[[Cockmongler|prototype/hunter]]" to kill Isaac. This [[Moshzilla|creature]] is a pain in the ass due to the fact that [[Superman|IT CANNOT DIE]] unless you [[KILL IT WITH FIRE]]. It follows Isaac around throughout the rest of the game until he finally arrives at the [[Penis|shuttle]] where it can be burned. During all this, Isaac is constantly annoyed by Kendra, Zach, and his [[Imaginary|girlfriend]], Nicole.

Eventually, Kendra becomes a Jew and runs off with the marker so she can sell it to some other colony. Fortunately, you pull that [[slut]] back into the ship and fly down to the planet that the ship is orbiting. Isaac then plants the marker on the planet because his (DEAD DEAD DEAD) girlfriend told him to. Being the bitch that she is, Kendra reveals to Isaac that Nicole had [[An hero|killed herself]] and all this time he's been [[Batshit insane|hallucinating]], as the Marker used her image to control him and bring itself back to the planet, where it turns out Isaac made a [[Rosie O'Donnell|giant vagina monster]] wake up. Kendra gets [[Vore|eaten]] by it, the player kills it and escapes from the planet, the planet explodes, and Isaac is <s>killed by his [[zombie]] girlfriend who inexplicably got onboard the ship</s> '''IT WAS A HALLUCINATION'''.

All in all, the entire fucking thing is pointless. You did not save a single soul, the monsters would have died of [[AIDS]] eventually, no one will know anything of what happened on that damned ship, and Isaac is <s>still a tool who does whatever the shit people tell him to do '''DEAD'''</s> '''ALIVE''', '''SEQUEL ANNOUNCED'''.

==Sound==
Sound plays a big part in Dead Space. This is one of the many hot sounds you will hear in the game:

==Dead Space 2==

'''Dead Space 2''' was announced at E3 along with a trailer and some of the story line. Isaac Clark has managed to survive being [[Buttsecks|raped]] by his dead girlfriend and has now gone utterly [[batshit|batshit insane]] from [[meth|dementia]]. You're rescued and taken to a space station called "The Sprawl" in the [[Arkansas|middle of nowhere]]. Soon after he arrives, a necromorph outbreak occurs due to retarded Unitologists believing in [[Indigo Children|"the next stage of human evolution"]]. Shitstorms happen, [[The Man|gov'ment wants to keep you down]] and you keep having bad acid trips. Oh, you also get to [[win|kill children in this one]].

==Unitology==
[[Scientology|Unitology]] is a [[religion]] in the game that revolves around the Marker (a big [[dildo]] with writing on it). The followers of this religion believe that the Marker brings eternal life and that human life started somewhere other than Earth. The Church of [[Scientology|Unitology]] has great political and economic power, allowing the [[religion]] to buy ships, weapons, and colonies. Later on in the game, Isaac realizes that the ship is not a mining vessel, but a [[Hurr|combat ship designed to kill stuff and things]]. After Isaac finds this out, he stumbles upon more audio logs of people [[Bawwwww|bitching and moaning]] about how there are illegal activities going on, or the occasional psychopathic follower whispering into the mic. 

[[Some argue|Some people think]] that [[EA]] put Unitology in the game in order to stick it to [[Scientology]] [[Idiftl|for the lulz]], but [[It is a mystery|that is a mystery]].

==Dark Humor==

[[Image:DeadSpace AttackBaby.jpg|thumb|RAWR!]]

Most of the humor in this game is "dark humor". In other words, the humor is [[Not|lulzy]]. This humor is shown in various ways throughout the game:

*When entering one of the rooms in the beginning of the game, a man will be bashing his head into a wall repeatedly like a [[retard]]ed person.

*A blind woman will be hugging and talking to a corpse with no limbs. The dumbass will somehow magically die a few seconds afterwards even though she has no wounds. This is when the player gets the power of kinesis and will be able to pick up her dead body and [[Necrophilia|do things]] with it.

*As the player enters the child care center, they will meet up with monsters that resemble [[Harlequin Ichthyosis Fetus|mutated babies]]. The player will be able to stomp on these baby monsters. This makes ''Dead Space'' [[lulz|unique]] in the fact that it is one of few games where you are actually allowed to kick and [[Pwnt|curbstomp]] babies [[Idiftl|for the lulz]].

*In the medical ward of the ship, a man is lying down on a table while a doctor is [[Gurochan|chopping him up with a saw]]. For [[sick fucks]], this is probably the hottest thing going on in the game. The doctor will then look at you and smile. Shortly afterward, she will become [[an hero]] and slice her throat with the saw instead of [[Irony|going to you for help]].

*Isaac's psychopathic imaginings of other crew members saying, "[[Lolwut|MAKE US WHOLE AGAIN]]".  

*Near the end of [[the game]], Kendra, the Jew [[bitch]] in the game, tries to get off of the planet. Instead she literally becomes a [[guro]] [[rape]] toy for a [[tentacle monster]].

==The Ishimura==

The S.S. ''Ishimura'' is the piece of shit [[ship]] where the game takes place. It is reinforced by more ribs than a mutated cow and probably took the 3D designers [[over 9,000]] years to create. Despite all this designing and making everything look "pretty", it was completely useless due to the fact that it is so fucking [[Goth|dark]] and every other room is [[Period|littered with blood]] and dead bodies. 

The designers ripped off the ''Alien'' films and made the ship a maze of vents and other places for [[freaks]] to crawl through. The player never really gets to look in these vents, even though it would be seriously scary if the player was forced to navigate them while avoiding the [[orgy|cluster fucking]] of being jumped on by multiple necromorphs. It can be assumed that the vents are the equivalent of your college dorm room--full of dead bodies, bongs, piss stains on the rug, a large turd in the bathtub, and over all [[necrophilia|good times that you will later regret on your 40th birthday]].

==Dead Space: Downfall==

[[Image:TTA_Downfall_by_GuiMontag.jpg|thumb|[[Furry|Screenshot from Dead Space: Downfall]]]]

''Dead Space: Downfall'' is a failure of an <s>anime</s> American-animated movie [[Fail|showing]] how the necromorphs came to be and how they [[This is why we can't have nice things|fucked everything up]]. The people at EA thought it would be cool to allow the player to see what happened before Isaac boards the ship. This ruins the fun of the player be able to wonder how and why everything is messed up in the beginning of the game. The idea of buying this movie is [[retarded]] in itself. For every [[win]], there is always a [[fail]]...

On a side note, this is every [[Sick fuck|guro-lover's]] wet dream. There's more [[Al Gore|gore]] in this [[movie]] than there is [[violence]] in all Gears of War games combined.

Bring spare underwear, since [[you]]'re watching it.


<s>'''SPOILERS:''' Everyone DIES.</s> Any dipshit with a brain knows that if they play a game in which everyone is ALREADY FUCKING DEAD a movie set as a prequel will have EVERYONE DEAD AT THE END OF IT.

==Dead Space: Extraction==
 
Another fucking prequel coming out for the [[Wii]]. It's going to be a first-person shooter without free movement. You play as a bunch of other losers [[Shit nobody cares about|no one cares about]]. First there's this miner named Sam Caldwell, and he and his buddies extract the marker. Then, shit goes wrong, and they hide like pussies. After getting lost, they find that people have gone batshit insane. After riveting people for ten minutes, the next character you play as, a rent-a-cop named Nate McNeil, and his gang shoot him dead. Days later, Nate and his butt buddy Gabe Weller, a GAR tough guy from the Ishimura, decide to rape some bodies. After seeing even more people go insane, they run around and find some slut named Lexine Murdoch. After failing at getting off the planet, they find some pompous tart named Warren Eckhard. The they FINALLY find a ship and go to the Ishimura. After more TL;DP action, Warren betrays you and then dies. Nate gets his hand impaled on a spike from an alien, and you have to cut off HIS FUCKING ARM to free him. Then Nate, Gabe, and Lexine get on the shuttle, and there's buttsex all around.

==Necromorphs==

[[Image:Dead_Space_Om_Nom_Nom.jpg|thumb|[[OM NOM NOM|OM NOM NOM NOM NOM]]!!!]]

[[Image:DeadSpace_FlyingVag.jpg|thumb|A vagina monster in the background with a slasher.]]

Necromorphs are the [[Zombie|living dead]] that Isaac fights off throughout the whole game. Most of the necromorphs originate from humans infected with space AIDS. In order for a person to turn into a necromorph, the person has to be <s>dead</s> gay. Then, a [[DaHaloChick|piece of flesh]] [[Necrophilia|fucks the dead body]] of the person, [[Goatse|stretching the flesh]] and making all of his or her limbs blades. There are multiple types of necromorphs in the game. All are extremely annoying.

<b><u>Types of Necromorphs</u></b>

*<i><b>[[Slashfic|Slashers]]</b></i> - Slashers are the most common necromorph found in the game. Being weak, these enemies are cannon fodder and a waste of time. These enemies are amusing though because of the fact that they run into malfunctioning doors and get chopped up to bits. [[Chikins|Yum]].

*<i><b>Leapers</b></i> - These fuckers jump all over the place like a kid who has [[ADD]]. Complete with blades for arms and a tail that is used for whipping attacks, it can do [[massive damage]] to Isaac. Fortunately, this type of necromorph can be easily raped with a [[Emo|cutter]] or [[Saw|sawblade]]. [[Arnold|Turn that muscle into mush.]]

*<i><b>[[Lurk Moar|Lurkers]]</b></i> - These are simply babies. All they want is for Isaac to hug them but instead he shoots them with his space hammer, so three massive cocks pop out of their backs and fling razor sperm at him. The only satisfaction that the [[Sick fuck|player]] will have from these monsters is the [[baby fuck|curbstomping and kicking of babies.]]

*<i><b>[[Fat|Guardians]]</b></i> - Guardians are mutations of [[pregnant]] [[Russian]] [[women]]. They cling to the walls and cannot move. They shit out [[Harlequin Ichthyosis Fetus|baby necromorphs]] every few seconds, and will [[rape]] your head off with their [[tentacle]]s if Isaac gets too close, making the difference between them and normal Russian pregnant women impossible to notice. Once the player kills one, though, it lets out a [[Orgasm|climactic cry]] and dies.

*<i><b>[[Pregnant]]s (aka Preggorz)</b></i> - Pregnants are post-[[Fat Chicks in Party Hats|eat attack]] fatties. Once they come close to Isaac, they will shit out small octopus-looking [[Paul the Psychic Octopus|creatures]] called "swarmers". 

*<i><b>[[Spiders|Swarmers]]</b></i> - [[Scat|AIDS infected feces]] that scuttle around and latch on to Isaac. Isaac must have a self-induced [[seizure]] to shake them off.

*<i><b>[[Divide by zero|Divider]]</b></i> - Dividers are a pain in the ass to kill. The player will start shooting at one just like any other enemy thinking that it will die. Instead, the thing breaks up into multiple pieces which [[BDSM|whip the shit out of Isaac]]. When killed by a divider's head, Isaac gets skullfucked then decapitated, replacing his head with the divider's head, producing what could be described as one of the most [[lulzy]] deaths in a video game.

*<i><b>[[Bubba|Brutes]]</b></i> - Plows through everything like the [[killdozer]]. Raping the hell out of everything, this necromorph does tons of damage and will '''fuck you up'''.

*<i><b>[[Swine flu|Infector]]</b></i> - A [[Vagina|piece of flesh]] that flies over to dead corpses and brutally [[rape|skull-fucks]] them until they turn into a slasher. These slashers are normally the color of [[crap]] (nugget brown, not baby green) and are hard to kill.

*<i><b>[[Epilepsy|Twitchers]]</b></i> - Extremely fast slashers. [[Boxxy|They shake their head all over the place]] and attack in packs. Battles with this enemy will make the player [[Frustration|frustrated]].

*<i><b>Black Slashers</b></i> - Same as regular Slashers, but they are [[DOUBLE NIGGER|twice as strong, twice as fast, and have twice as much health]].

*<i><b>[[Left 4 Dead|Boomers]]</b></i> - Mutated humans with a giant explosive tumor for an arm. Shoot the arm and enjoy the fireworks.

*<i><b>[[Drugs|Wheezers]]</b></i> - A collection of eight [[Tits|huge-lunged]] almost-an-heroes blowing bongsmoke all over the place. Largely considered to be the easiest monsters in the game, due to being weak and rooted into the ground. You have to kill all of these as part of a mission in order to prevent the utter rapage of the ship's oxygen.

==Characters==

*<i><b>Jew</b></i> - The player's character. Isaac will be all of the other characters' [[Slavery|slave]], doing stupid tasks that they can do themselves, such as turning off the reactor even though they are right near it. Isaac finds out that he is [[Insane|psycho]] because, even though his girlfriend is dead, he keeps [[Necrophilia|seeing her]].

*<i><b>[[Bitch|Kendra Daniels]]</b></i> - The stupid whore who is really nice in the beginning of the game and then tries to backstab Isaac in the end. She [[Fail|fails it]] though, and gets pwnt by the Hive Mind.

*<i><b>[[Black|Zach Hammond]]</b></i> - [[The man]] who tells Isaac to do tasks so that the crew can get off the ship. He [[Lie|tries to meet you every chance he can]] but is always interrupted. Whenever Isaac does meet him in the game, though, Zach is always hurt because he's a little bitch who doesn't even know how to use his weapon. Finally, he is ripped apart into tiny little pieces by a [[Chris Benoit|brute]] (because in any good work of horror, the black guy ALWAYS dies first). 

*<i><b>[[L. Ron Hubbard|Dr. Challus Mercer]]</b></i> - [[Scientology|A fucking idiot]] who thinks that the necromorphs give everlasting life. He is so fucked up that he creates a [[Pedobear|"prototype/hunter"]] to kill Isaac. Of course Isaac [[Owned|pwns the monster two times]] and Charles goes [[an hero]] via letting himself be [[fellatio|skull-fucked]] brutally by an Infector.

*<i><b>[[German|Doctor Terrence Kyne]]</b></i> - A [[Scientologist|Unitologist]] who tries to help Isaac, but the dumb fuck gets shot by [[Whore|Kendra]]. Like Isaac, he seems to still be [[Necrophilia|seeing]] his dead lover.

*<i><b>[[Jailbait|Nicole Brennan]]</b></i> - Isaac's dead girlfriend. Isaac sees her throughout the whole game and at the end of the game has [[zombie]] sex with her.

==Bosses==

*<i><b>[[Vagina|The Leviathan]]</b></i> - A giant [[goatse]] in an even more giant tumble dryer. When weakened, it shoots [[Tubgirl|exploding loogies]] at you.

*<i><b>[[Pedophile|The Hunter]]</b></i> - A magical, giant necromorph that CANNOT DIE!!OMGWTFBBQ!! The only thing you can do to keep this thing off of your tail is to cut all of its arms and legs off, which will only act as a minor annoyance as it [[Fuck|instantly grows them all back]]. Eventually you lead it into an LG brand refrigerator and freeze it, but that bastard Mercer predictably thaws it. Then you have to [[KILL IT WITH FIRE]] just to prove you won't put up with Mercer's bullshit anymore.

*<i><b>[[Giant enemy crab|The Big Thing That Throws Shit At You]]</b></i> -  Why doesn't this monster have a name? The writers were [[Too lazy|lazy]]. Basically all you have to do is shoot the fuck out of it with a laser turret gun. (You have to do this because it's blocking the signal to some other ship that crashes into you because it picked up an escape pod that had [[pussy|just ONE of the EASY necromorphs in it.]])

*<i><b>[[Hentai|The Hivemind]]</b></i> - The final boss of the game. the Hivemind is a really, really, really, REALLY big [[penis]] shaped tentacle monster that will fuck you up if you don't kill it fast. All it really does is smash its tentacles at you and [[Bill O'Reilly|scream in your face.]] Some of the [[nice try|<s>Sciento</s> Unitologists]] say that it controls every single necromorph. [[THEN WHO WAS PHONE|Then when you kill it, how is your girlfriend still alive]]?

To make things simple, here is walkthrough on how to kill these things.

*The Leviathan - First shoot the glowing things on its tentacles, then [[Fellatio|shoot into its throat]].

*The Hunter - [[Run Chubby|Run]], cut off limbs, run, cut off limbs, run, cut off limbs, burn. Done!

*The Big Thing - Like I said, [[Bukkake|shoot the fuck out of it.]]

*The Hivemind - Okay, this one is really complicated, so pay close attention. First you have to [[HNNNNNNGGGGG]]

==Weapons, Upgrades, Gadgets, and Utilities==

[[Image:DeadSpace_CutterGun.jpg|thumb|Isaac using the shitty [[cutter]] gun against babies.]]

<b><u>Weapons</u></b><br>

*<i><b>211-V Plasma Cutter</b></i> - A Future Fucking Staple Gun from the Fucking Future. Isaac finds it in the ship's [[Wal-Mart|Home Depot]]. This is the first weapon that the player will pick up in the game.

*<i><b>SWS Motorized Pulse Rifle</b></i> - This [[awesome|gun]] does <s>hardly any</s> <b>MAXIMUM</b> damage and runs out of [[Cum|ammo]] extremely quickly. Most people [[Baw|beg]] to differ by saying that it's great for [[Gary Coleman|small enemies]], but those people are retarded.

*<i><b>PFM-100 Hydrogen Torch Flamethrower</b></i> - [[KILL IT WITH FIRE]].

*<i><b>IM-822 Handheld Ore Cutter Line Gun</b></i> - This gun is meant to cut [[Killdozer|things in half]]. Guts will go all over the place when this thing shoots.

*<i><b>C99 Supercollider Contact Beam</b></i> - [[LAZOR|IMMA CHARGIN' MAI LAZOR!1!11]]

*<i><b>Force Gun</b></i> - A space age leafblower, used like a shotgun.

*<i><b>RC-DS Remote Control Disc Ripper (AKA Sawblade Gun)</b></i> -[[Extreme advertising|THIS MOTHER FUCKIN' WEAPON WILL NOT ONLY RAPE THE SHIT OUT OF YOUR ENEMY, BUT ALSO SLICE AND DICE THAT MOTHER FUCKER. YOU SEE THAT MOTHER FUCKER RIGHT THERE AND SHING, DONE!!!!]]

*<i><b>The Javelin Gun</b></i>-New weapon in Dead Space 2 that shoots [[cocks|titanium spikes that pin enemies to walls]]. The alt fire electrifies said spikes.
<b><u>Gadgets</u></b>

*<i><b>Stasis Module</b></i> - A device that allows you to slow stuff down a little, so you can either run away like an overcharged speed-freak or get a better shot at [[Ball|the more vulnerable parts of an enemy.]]

*<i><b>Kinesis Module</b></i> - Another doohickey that enables the ability to move stuff around [[Psychic|with your mind]]. Used to move the corpses of female crewmembers into erotic positions by [[You|freaks who get off to dead chicks]].

<b><u>Upgrades</u></b>

*<i><b>Weapon Upgrades</b></i> - It's not even worth the trouble of trying to find [[The Power 5|power]] nodes to upgrade the [[Humane weapons|shitty weapons]].

*<i><b>Suit Upgrades</b></i> - The suit can be upgraded in two ways: the [[Level Up|level]] (one to five) or with power nodes. Upgrading the level of the suit makes the suit look [[Shit|awesome]] while the power nodes upgrade armor and damage. This is ridiculous, though, because of the fact that the upgrades [[Goggles|do nothing]].

<b><u>Utilities</u></b>

*<i><b>Shop</b></i> - The player buys stuff here (you should know that by the name of "shop", [[You|fucktards]]). The player has to spend [[Jew Gold|money]] that is virtually useless on guns that suck ass.

*<i><b>Bench</b></i> - No, you do not sit on the bench (unless you want your [[Goatse|ass ripped open]]). The bench is an upgrade station to make your equipment from bad to worse.

==Quotes and Bitching==

{{squote|The only thing 3rd person does for a game is kill the realism and cut your viewing area in half. When I was able to move around the game got much worse. Picture Resident Evil 4, but with more sluggish controls.|Obviously someone who's a Jew.}}
