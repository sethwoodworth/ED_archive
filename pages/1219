'''Bullshit''' is when you [[George W. Bush|lie, but fail at it]]. '''Bullshitting''' is the aforementioned failure, and is considered a pretty good way of picking up some [[pussy]] at the local bar on a Friday night- by [[lies|describing your rich, handsome cousin's life as your own]], for example. '''Bullshit''' can also be used to describe [[nonsense]], but is rarely used to do so.

Where does the word come from? Well, [[Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh|dur-hey]], it comes from that brown [[shit|fecal matter]] that [[Lol-cow|cows]] produce when you've fed them too much beef, cheese, or small children (no shit).

The origins of the word "bullshit" do not require [[lame|amazing]] deductive powers of [[internet]] [[nerds]] to deduce where the word came from. Why!? Just look at the word for a second...okay? Now find a cow and place your head directly under its ass (presumably after you have fed it large quantities of [[Chinese]] [[Scruncher or Folder|toilet paper]]). You must wait for [[at least 100]] minutes until said cow delivers its large brown envelope. ''Note: this process is the only way to avoid becoming [[unfunny|utter]]ly confused about the true meaning of "bullshit."'' 

If you're still [[I'm so confused|confused]], here are some more [[fact|facts]]: At first, people used "[[poop|humanpoop]]", but seeing as how the word "human" was not a four-letter word and to compare a human to a [[human]] would not be as [[funny|lulzworthy]] as comparing a human to an [[animal]], a new word had adopted. Also, people refused to use the word "poop" because it made them sound like a [[13-year-old boy]]. Next, people started using "[[Food|cowpie]]", but that was too unpopular considering that there were [[Over 9000|too many]] insults already found in the ''[[Islam|Insults for Dummies]]'' handbook that already used the word "cow" and there were too many complaints that the stuff did not even taste like [[pie]]. Additionally, "cow" did not pass the four-letter litmus test. Finally, after much trial and error, people switched to using the "bullshit." And there you have it, the history of bullshit.

It would also be worth noting that everything you have just read in the paragraph above is complete bullshit.
