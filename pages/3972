[[File:PWNED.jpg|thumb|This image has a [[Good Joke:Word Count Ratio|GJ:WC]] of precisely 1:100,1 - making it just over twice as [[unfunny]] as [[Ghostlight]].]]
[[File:Rfjasonpoocomment.jpg|thumb|This image contains a lot of words, but nowhere near enough jokes to compensate for the automatic +1,000 words that an image is worth.]]
[[File:Yergunnagetraped.jpg|thumb|[[cp|Sharing images]] is a good way to get [[raped]]]]
[[File:Cutekitten.jpg|thumb|This image contains four words, none of which stop the entire image from simply being one gigantic joke.]]

Because an '''image'''=1,000 words, the [[Good Joke:Word Count Ratio]] is lowered to 1:1,000 or worse.  However, from [[pron]] to [[pornography]], images [[fap|play a vital role]] in the [[internets]].

==File formats==

{{tinyquote|PNG is a lossless format and is important for ARCHIVING purposes, as well as its support of alpha transparencies and palette based images, however for general web use you should always use JPG unless, as I said, you have a palette based image or an image that needs a transparency.  For general use, a JPG image with the least amount of compression will be virtually indistinguishable from a lossless PNG, in fact, unless you're an nth level graphic designer and specifically know what to look for, and take the time to CLOSELY examine the file, you will not be able to tell the difference.  Further, the image you've provided, was not ORIGINALLY a PNG, in fact it appears to be a from a webcam that was likely using an MPEG variant for compression, which, as you obviously don't know, is a derivative of JPEG compression.  So essentially your stupid ass took an ALREADY COMPRESSED image and then you saved it as a PNG file, needlessly bloating it.  Because you simply can't pull quality out of your ass that didn't exist in the first place.  Furthermore, as a rich little white kid I'm sure 454 KB, A HALF MEGABYTE OF DATA, seems like "nothing" on your parents high speed Internet access, however the VAST MAJORITY of the planet does *NOT* half high speed connections.  Furthermore, needlessly bloating images can also quickly muck up the cache files of people's browsers and can generally have an all around degrading affect to the performance of their computer as well as make their browser less stable.  Basically, the more shit you're pouring into memory, the greater the chance for fuckups, and unless you have EEC, high grade, very expensive memory, well that means you're exponentially increasing the odds that people's browsers are going to choke and crash on your needlessly bloated image.|'''TL;DR'''-[[User:Itchy Balls]] pretending to know his [[CSIII]]| on an [[File_Talk:04-13-10_tits.png|ugly tit-shot's]] talk page.|color=limegreen}}

===BMP===
'''Bitmap''' is used by [[Windows]] computers for everything; every time you [[copy|CTRL+C]]/[[paste|CTRL+V]] images, use [[screenshot|PrintScreen]], or use [[MS Paint]], [[Windows]] creates a BMP file.  As a very compressed and workable format, they recommended for any online [[serious business|work]].

===GIF===
<div style="overflow:auto;">{{Main|GIF}}</div>

Technically lossless, each pixel only holds 8 bits of [[data]], they have less color options than JPEG's.  GIF files become blurry and disfigured when enlarged or shrunk.  The only advantage of GIF files are the [[porn|animated images]].

===JPEG===
The most common format on the [[Interwebs]] due to amount of [[data]] that can be stored in each pixel and is recommended for [[Flickr|photographers]].  JPEG is lossy, and [[quality]] is lost each time the image is compressed.

===PNG===
<div style="overflow:auto;">{{Main|PNG}}</div>

[[some argue|The greatest on the Interwebs.]]  It was created to replace GIF , the files are lossless, and can be enlarged or shrunk without much damage.  PNG files would've eradicated GIF from the web if it weren't for two things:
#[[Micro$oft]] decided to not support it until [[Internet Explorer|IE 7]].
#The dev team decided to drop support for animation.

===MNG===
Created by the inventors as PNG, this format supports animation better than GIF.  As a result, [[Steve|Apple]] and [[Bill|Windows]] decided not to support MNG in their browsers.

===APNG===
An extension of the PNG format that supports animation.  APNG files are smaller and simpler than '''MNG'''.  [[Mozilla]] decided to [[troll]] the MNG community by dropping support and adding APNG support.

===SVG===
As vector images, they are better than raster images and can be resized without distortion.  Vector graphics are ideal for high-quality artwork.  Unfortunately, Internet Explorer requires plug-ins to render SVG.
