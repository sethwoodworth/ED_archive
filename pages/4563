'''Kewlies''' or '''Cool''' is a word that is used in order to be sarcastic or describe [[13-year-old boys|insecure children]]. It used to be used as a reference to temperature, but only [[Nerd|nerds]] use it for that now. Now if you ask somebody what the word cool means, they will [[o rly|tell you it refers to something that is cool]]. However, there's a good chance that they're just being [[Sarcasm|sarcastic]] because [[you|who]] the fuck uses the word "cool" anyway? I mean, [[SRSLY|really]]?


==What is coolness?==
Scientists have been pondering this for [[at least 100 years]]. This is because scientists want to be cool, so they can get [[pussy]]. Unfortunately, as [[nerd]]s, they will never be cool.

==How to measure coolness==
[[Shit nobody cares about|The standard SI unit of coolness is Fonzies or simply Fn, in honor of the coolest cat ever. The Fonz.  The formula for measuring coolness is: time x atomic coolness= overall coolness. Lets try an example!
Jimi Hendrix started his music career in 1966 to 1970. That is 883008000 sec. (Which is 4 years.) Next multiply 883008000 sec. by the atomic coolness. The atomic coolness of being a kick ass guitarist is exactly 100.897 acu (atomic coolness units). Now, just multiply both numbers: 883008000 sec x 100.897 acu= 8.90929 x 10^10 Fn (fonzies.) Note: 1 Fonz is always written as: 1 (sec.)(acu) which equals 1 cubic Fonz.]]
