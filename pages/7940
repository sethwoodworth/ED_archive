'''Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff''' is an incredible webcomic that makes you want to pour hydrofluoric acid on your eyes for the fact that it is the greatest thing you will ever see, and sight no longer matters. The author states that he does this to keep it more [[ironic]]. Millions of reasons as to why it is "the only website on the internet that matters" become apparent the moment the page first loads, but none of them matter because today i put jelly on this hot god.

== The Comic ==

The comic centers around two hella sweet bro gamers, getting into crazy hi-jinks and shit you'd have to be HIGH just to DO. Unlike those [[Ctrl Alt Del|copy and paste webcomics]] made by [[noobs]] abusing [[Photoshop]]'s dodge/burn tool, SBaHJ is crafted by master artisans with [[MS Paint|only the finest software known to man]].

It originates from a separate comic called [http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ Homestuck], which is frequently shat over by [[co|/co/.]] [[MSPaint Adventures|Homestuck is a somewhat complex comic]] [[shit nobody cares about|in the style of old text-based games, full of mind fuckery and time travel. It centers around 4 13-year-old kids who play a game which inadvertently fucks up their world, in favor of creating a new world.]] Dave Strider, one of the kids, is the current author of Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff. He is probably the [[cool]]est fucking guy you will ever know, or hope to be. That is all there really is to say on the matter.
