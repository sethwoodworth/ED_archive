'''Abducted IRC''' is a network whose members consist of exiled Indians, plotting [[Iran|Iranians]] and people banned from CyberArmy. The [[Cyndre|Psychic-Doom]] channel lives here. 

== I am MIZORAM and the state of India ==
[[At least 100 years ago]], the Mizos were exiled from India and CyberArmy. Since then, they have plagued the internets with their [[Furby|strange language]].  Their eunuch mother, India, will only permit 1 computer & IP per 24 families; as Indian families generally contain at least 70 members, this can be problematic.

Popular native slang terms are "dongs", "chukssss" & "lolzzzzzzzz." The former word is especially popular in #[[cock|shillong]], which may have a spiritual linking to India's hijra people (pictured).
