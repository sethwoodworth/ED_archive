The most powerful [[number]] in the world, but not the universe (see [[42]]). This series of hexadecimal shit is illegal in the United States, but not in the rest of the world, as they have sane laws (meaning that this number > the First Amendment), and single-handedly brought [[Digg]] [[fellatio|to its knees]] like a dominatrix. In the form of a hexadecimal string.

This incredibly boring line of [[bullshit]] is basically a code that will unlock every [[pwned|HD-DVD]] in existence. Fascinating stuff, I know. Apparently some [[retard|genius]] hacker, Arzenami, made it and decided to post it on an [[aspie]] forum. This sparked an internet [[circle jerk]] of panic and rampant nerds getting [[boner]]s trying the code out and spreading the good word. Everyone keeps posting it everywhere in an attempt to look like an [[Hal Turner|internet tough guy]]. [http://www.google.com/search?q=09+F9+11+02+9D+74+E3+5B+D8+41+56+C5+63+56+88+C0 Google "09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0" for moar info.] This basically goes to show that no matter how hard the motion picture industry tries to prevent [[pirate|piracy]], they [[fail]].

==How he did it==
To cut a long and boring story short what Arzenami did was make the completely un-remarkable assertion that whether you watch or rip the DVD you'll have to decode it and to decode it you need the key. Armed with this he realized also that to use the key any software that played HD-DVD's would have to load it into the computer's RAM before it was used in the decryption. What he did then was simply ID the part of the RAM being utilized by the HD-DVD playing software and then forced a dump to disk of that area of the RAM. He then simply looked through all the information that was dumped into a text file from his RAM for the string of hex and lo he looked upon it and saw that it was good.....so he shared it around, like AIDS except its [[Bug Chasers|something you'd actually want]].

==But no one gives a shit anymore==
Because Blu-ray won the [[special Olympics|format war]] faggots. <s>Enjoy your useless key.</s> In fact Blu-ray and HD-DVD use same encryption system called [[AIDS|AACS]], and HD-DVD being [[pwned]] means Blu-ray is pwned as well. Now that's how you can download high definition pr0ns. Next time you [[fap]], don't forget to show some respect to those hackers.
