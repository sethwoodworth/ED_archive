[http://www.stumbleupon.com StumbleUpon] is an [[InterWeb]] [[community]] which allows users to customize [[drama]] to their personal tastes. Through the user blog pages you can discover all types of shitty art, and by using the toolbar you can see the same flash animations that you're already sick of.
==WTF is SU?==
StumbleUpon may appear to be a toolbar to install in your [[browser]] of [[Mozilla Firefox|choice]], but the true features (ie. pure, unadulterated drama) naturally only come alive in the community aspects.

SU has user blogs [http://hardtohandle.stumbleupon.com/ where god awful photography and bad poetry can live side by side] and a forum section to group sites and form [[cliques]].

==Drama on SU==
[[Image:Stumbledrama.jpg|thumb|right|A drama SOS sent out to liz-cord's true friends. [http://www.stumbleupon.com/url/www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/ad62cedac4.jpg Community response:] "Good luck rallying the White Knights of the Internet. They don't care about your problems: they just want pictures of your tits."]]
For bonus points use a naked pic of yourself as an avatar and post in the [http://happy-birthday.group.stumbleupon.com/ Happy Birthday] forum.

Surprisingly, most of the drama is in the [http://gay-porn.group.stumbleupon.com/ forums]. In the "core forums," a pentangle of immaculate posting, the admins regularly delete threads and ban users for "unnecessary" posting. Many [[lulz]] were had over user [http://squirt.stumbleupon.com/ Squirt's] permanent ban from one (or possibly two) forum(s).
Additional drama comes from the friends network, where you can either fawn, be a minor [[internet celebrity]], or simply surf people's blogs for [http://putita.stumbleupon.com/ pr0n].

==Trolling==
Most Stumblers, desperate to be validated by the internet and rack up huge amounts of "fans" to lengthen their e-peen, will nearly always accept friend requests from complete strangers. Because the site is built on old code the [[ebay|new owners]] hardly ever bother fixing there are still plenty of glitches and oversights begging for abuse most notably the "Send to" function.
#Go to furaffinity
#Click the review button to see who thumbed it up to find all the furfags.
#Add them as friends.
#Go to [[The_Great_ImageFap_Troll|any]] [http://someshit.on.nimp.org/ great] [[pain|webpage]].
#Send the page [[over 9000]] times to them in a row.
#????
#PROFIT!
==Content==
99% of the sites you'll come across in any given category will consist of [[lolcats]], [[child porn]], [[old meme]]s, [[Chuck Norris]] jokes, shitty [[portal]] references,  [[Ron Paul]] [[faggot|fanbois]] and that webpage you just saw 5 minutes ago. The users are the only thing worse than the websites - Everyone will comment by simply copying and pasting some sentence found on the website, followed by either "lol" "XD" or "love it!". For example, a stumbleupon review of ED would probably look like:
