[[File:Ironmannumbers poster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Coming May 2011]]

You've seen YouTube videos like this go viral every month. April of '09 brought us [[Angry Homo Kid]]. May of that same year would bring us [[MMORPG Freak Out]]. [[Epic Beard Man]] took the public by storm in February of 2010. The flavor of April-May for [[2010|this year]] is actually a video submitted to YouTube at some point last year, and which only ended up going viral the next.

'''Iron Man Numbers''' documents the supposed break-up of [[Youtube Nobodies|YouTube user]] {{youtube2|jerkstore|Ryan "Jerkstore" Dicks}} with his [[batshit insane]] girlfriend, Jenna. The video runs 8 minutes in length, and contains more memorable quotes than you can shake a stick at. Ryan would later [[troll's remorse|take the video down]], but luckily, [[trollface|someone else had a copy]].

After the video went viral, Jenna [[What|cut up her face]] while Jerkstore lol'd, and promptly submitted the video to YouTube.

==[[WTF]] are "Iron Man Numbers"?==
According to [[Urban Dictionary]] in [[2009]], 
{{quote|1=When something reaches a very large number of hits. Similarly to the hit blockbuster movie Iron Man did in theaters.|2=[[Urban Dictionary]]|3=[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Iron%20Man%20Numbers]}}

You probably could have inferred that, but we'll tell you anyway. More importantly, why was he [[USI|bragging about his thread's view counts]] while discussing a relationship?

==Background==
Jerkstore aka Ryan was just a hipster fag on this rap forum back in 2006-7.  There was this female user [[milf|Myst]] that started to build a liking to him.  Ryan, 18 at the time, decided he wanted to meet up with Myst(Jenna) IRL(who was at least like 27).  They seemed to have hit it off pretty well and ended up living together.  Well a while after Ryan posts this thread below:

{{quote|as those close to me have heard, i just recently got home from my 2 and a half month stay with jen. i broke up with her the day after i got home. an abortion of a relationship and a long time coming. she's a [[Canadian|repulsive humanbeing]].  [[Aspierations|to prove that i don't give a fuck anymore i decided to make a post."]]}}

Not much is known in regards to background at the moment. Due to the Tim Horton's cup and the Shoppers drug mart bag, we can assume he is in [[Canada]]. Details of the relationship are still unknown.

==Real?==
There remains some debate over if this is real. Many of Ryan's videos are full of [[attention whoring]] and [[some argue|some have called]] their performances a mere charade. However, [[me|some]] point out that Ryan deleted the video from his [[youtube]], perhaps out of [[troll's remorse]] or realizing the legal status of recording a phone call without the other party's consent in most states as evidence that shit's real. It's pretty lol either way, but of course we at ED prefer drama, so we're hoping shit's legit.

===Update===
[[File:Ironmannumbers -not me.jpg|thumb|WARNING! This photo is not Ryan.  Nobody who looks like this could be expected to have IRON MAN NUMBERS.]]

It seems [[Rob McElhenney|Ryan]] is still dating Jenna.  He claims, publicly on his [http://www.formspring.me/jerkstore forumspring account] that they '''''"the background behind this video is i was getting a lot of attention online that day which is always a trigger for my girlfriend and going through relationship problems and on my online peak had discussed breaking up (we break up a lot but as of right now going to say currently together)..."'''''  Why this idiot would put up with the antics of a shrill bitch like Jenna is beyond definition and only points to his own dramatic lack of self respect.  Further, Jenna reads Linda Goodman's "Love Signs" (as shown in one of the pictures below) and constantly posts about crystals and moon phases which only further illustrates her lack of common sense.  Hey, guess what?  These two deserve each other because nobody else should be subjected to  his attention whoring and her dingbat hippy mannerisms.

Ryan is also a very conscientious boyfriend as well, despite the fact that he posts retarded youtube videos of his girlfriend freaking out, thus ruining her already shaky mental well-being, he feels the need to stay away from all the "hot chicks" on soulseek.  '''''"i quit for [[WTF|jen's sanity]] she was very jealous of all the chicks that wanted to fuck me and the fact that half of them lived in california."'''''
