A '''colorbar''' is a pseudo-[[meme]] which originated as [[Marriage is love]] by {{lj|shared_boxers}}.  Generally composed of a table with [[HTML]] color codes or an image-based strip of pictures manipulated in [[photoshop]] to be colored as a rainbow, a colorbar is generally subtitled with the expression "X is love," wherein "X" denotes whatever vile perversion the colorbar is about.

==Best Examples==

Very soon after the first colorbar ("marriage is about love"), a second colorbar came out, titled "marriage is between a man and a woman".  This second colorbar received much negative [[attention]] but was nowhere near as popular as the first one, because most Americans are idiotic, [[Bible]]-thumping [[redneck]]s who disagree with all-around equality, but have been brainwashed by a media campaign designed to portray [[sodomy]] as a natural expression of love.

Since then, colorbars have joined the ranks of other types of meme art such as the [[image macro]] in becoming increasingly complex and often finely crafted, and being used for the purposes of [[troll]]ing or making amusing or ironic points.  Some of the best image-based colorbars are presented here.
