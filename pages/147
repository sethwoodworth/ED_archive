AMV
{{potential}}

An '''AMV''' ('''A'''nime '''M'''usic '''V'''ideo) is a [[music video]] created by [[animu]] [[fantard]]s. The videos are made by splicing together clips from animé [[film]]s or [[TV]] episodes and spliced together to fit whatever [[retarded]] song the greasy fanboys desires.  The word "fit" is used lightly because 198% of all AMVs are made by cutting up a video without even listening to the song. Copious amounts of stock effects are often used, courtesy of their [[pirate]]d version of [[Sony Vegas]].  Luckily, these [[Faggot|editors]] [[Fail|are highly skilled at their trade.]] Generally, these "[[lies|artist]]s" create their "[[art]]" via the [[art theft|theft of other people's material]] and [[DeviantArt|rarely create anything remotely original]]. 

It is a well known [[fact]] that [[99%|49%]] of all AMVs are of [[Dragonball Z]] set to [[Linkin Park]]'s song "[[Emo|In The End]]" while the other [[99%|49%]] are [[Naruto]] clips set to songs by [[Pathetic|Three Days Grace]] - either [[Sob story|Pain]] or [[Unwarranted self importance|I Hate Everything About You]]. The remaining 2% are set to [[They Might be Giants]], but nobody wants to talk about that. However, if you ever use a Kitaro song for an AMV, [[you're doing it wrong]]

== [[Video game|(Video) Game]] Music Videos==
Another type of AMV is commonly known as a '''GMV''' ('''G'''ame '''M'''usic '''V'''ideo), or a '''VGMV''' ('''V'''ideo '''G'''''ame'' '''M'''usic '''V'''ideo). These are generally made by [[fanboys]] that are too [[lazy]] to be bothered to watch animé. While AMVs are dominated by shitty Naruto and Dragonball Z videos, GMVs are [[99%]] [[Kingdom Hearts]] (because Sora is, [[like]], ''soooooo'' [[hawt]]!!) videos and the last 1% are made by totally [[fag|awesome]] [[Nintendo]] fans.

==The People Who Make These==


Are the total snobs of the weeaboo world. They think they're hot shit because they know how to [[pirate|pirate]] episodes of their favorite tv shows, add some rainbow colors and cut some scenes here and there, slap their favorite Linkin Park song on it, and upload it to Youtube! WOOOOOOOAH! [[not|So talented]]! There are three different breeds of this type, classified by their level of [[failure|success]].

*'''Casual Newbies'''- Usually ages 10-13. They're new to this sort of thing. Not exactly snobby but a total red flag for [[troll bait|trollbait]]. Their AMVs always consist of complete suckage due to the fact that it's probably a boring picture slideshow because they're too dumb to figure out how to get and use actual clips from shows. That or they're using [[windows movie maker|Window Movie Maker]] and have no idea as to what the hell they're doing. Has little to no subscribers but some friends in the making.

*'''Casuals'''- This is the larval stage of the Casual newbies. Casuals still suck but this time take their time to make it look half-ok. This is also the stage where they probably outgrow WMM. They also grow in subscribers and friends because of this... Unfortunately, their faggotry only gets worse from this. When popularity comes so does a big head, and the delusion that you have talent and can count it as "job experience". Maybe that's stretching it, but you never know when you have people roaming around the internet like..

*'''Those Hardcore Weeaboos'''- Final stage of AMVers that blossom into a butterfly of torchure. Usually ages 16-35. All of them have already upgraded to [[sony vegas|Sony Vegas]] and more than likely have a lot of subscribers/friends. They're the popular weeaboos on Youtube who like to host AMV contests for the little ones, and also like to critique other AMVs like they're so talented at it and [[unwarranted self-importance|know everything about the profession]]. They'll also block you if you have anything negative to say about their attitude/videos. If you thumbs down one of their AMVs they'll hunt you down like a prairie dog and shoot you in your sleep. If you ask them if you can take some of their clips, they'll go apeshit on you and make a whole [[BAWWWW|drama video]] how people should stop stealing their clips, even though [[irony|the tv episodes weren't theirs in the first place since they didn't make them and must have pirated them from somewhere]]..

==Youtube Staff love AMVS==
Instead of deleting the minions of AMVs from obviously stolen copyrighted animation, the Weabooish admins spend the time deleting actually good content proving how much of dumbfucks they really are.

== "The Org" ==
This is [[bullshit|the real deal]], folks. All those YouTube AMVs are child's play. If you want [[AIDS|quality entertainment]], come to the [http://animemusicvideos.org Org]. [[Shit nobody cares about|Everyone knows that the Orgy only breeds top-notch editors, and the AMV makers of YouTube are just faggots that don't know anything. And don't even think of giving criticism to a video unless it's worse than your work, because only the Gods know what makes something good or bad.]] [[truth|But of course all AMVs are gay and all AMV makers are fags.]]
