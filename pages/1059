'''BlueshineWolf''' (also known by her fans as "Nikki" or "Moon" @w@) is a [[16-year-old girl|15-year-old]] [[furry]]/[[wolfaboo]] who is most noted for two things: creating unremarkable [[sparkledog]] characters and then [[bawww|throwing a bitchfit]] when people don't start [[fap]]ping to them. She is currently whoring herself out to her fans by selling $30 [[dildo|figurines]] of her [[sparkledog]] character [http://www.patchtogether.com/store/store/view/id/167 Assuva], as well as [http://blueshinewolf.deviantart.com/art/T-S-Poster-136991718 giant posters] of her [[wolf]] characters, which have been confirmed by several sources to be "[[creepychan|creepy as shit]]."<br/>Despite the fact that she is only a high school student, Blueshine has already elected herself [[Final boss|Queen of the Wolves]] and will proceed to sic her [[personal army|mindless fans]] on you if you dare to [[Constructive criticism|critique]] her [[shit|beautiful artwork]].

==[[Twilight]] Spirits==
[[Image:niksters.png|thumb|left|Hanging with a sparklewolf is not cool, kids. Someone's going to feel stupid for making things like this once they grow up.]]
[[Image:bswolfcover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Omg [[Kay Fedewa|originality]].]]

Blueshine's pride and joy is her comic, inventively titled ''Twilight Spirits'' (yes, fucking [[Twilight]]) that she made when she was [[13-year old girl|13.]] [[Facepalm|Yes, fucking 13.]] she never dropped the generic sparkleshit she thought up of [[You|like everyone else did at the age.]] Unlike Moonshine, [[Unrealistic expectations|she never dropped the stupid shit and moved on to her senses.]] This [[shit|completely original and thrilling tale]] tells the story of a young [[Sparkledog|sparklewolf]] named [[Mary sue|Moon]] who goes on an [[Boring|epic]] journey to find... to find...well, you see, BlueshineWolf is too busy fapping over her own artwork to even bother finishing her comic. After a [[boring|thrilling]] 13-page run, she's halted work on ''Twilight Spirits'' to work on a new comic about a [[weeaboo|wolf living in Japan]] who [[Naruto|takes karate lessons]]. It ended up being yet [[Srsly|ANOTHER comic that she never finished.]] [[Epic fail|Way to go, Blueshine!]]

Despite the fact that the comic has no plot or substance, despite the fact that Blueshine has stopped thinking about it, and despite the fact that she refuses to discuss it, she has somehow managed to attract a humongous number of [[retards|fans]] to her shitty comic despite that [[Lazy|she never fucking finished it,]] [[Not|always says she's going to finish it,]] [[Lies|and makes up excuses to evade her angry fantards on WHY she didn't finish it.]] Repeat.

[[image:Tsofficalsite.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Nikki showing her writing skills]]

Truly a master of her craft.

==Disney==
Oh lawd, She is now [[Attention whoring|insisting]] she is [[Lie|getting hired by Disney.]]

{{quote|EDIT: Also another update about my art status. I'll be posting my owed artwork [[Never|as soon as these events pass.]] I've been getting less and less time on the internet. [[Lie|I've been taking several trips to Disney to take care of artwork matters and such.]] Big changes are happening, I'll most likely be [[Not|getting a job]] at the parks [[LOL|after school ends.]] Needless to say, things are getting tougher and busier, but things are finally taking a turn for the better, and I'm glad.| Srsly, u gaiz}} 

Because we all know Disney wants to take in a cookie cutter cliche sparkledog story that wasn't even finished, that was also made by a ''16 year old girl'', right? [[Bullshit|(cuz hur granny gawt sick and died omg :[)]]


==Fantardation==
Of course, since Blueshinewolf is too much of a [[pussy]] to fight her own fights, she gets her [[13 year old girl|fans]] to fight them for her. Since her [[Lie|Granny died]] fans have been asspating her and violently defending her even more than before. However what they do not know is that this is yet another excuse, [[Yes|or perhaps lie]], as to why her comics will never be finished. 

Typical.

==Totally Original Characters==
[[Image:Blooshoinwolf.jpg|thumb|[[Woll Smoth|Blooshoon's roaction to thos artocle]].]]
[[Image:Moony this is sparta.jpg|thumb|TO!!! THIS!! ARTICLEEE!!!]]
[[Image:Moonyisnotamusedcopy.jpg|thumb|IT'S MOTHERFUCKING HULK OUT TIME.]]
Blueshine is fiercely protective of her [[Hinauchi|original characters]]. As these characters are all hideously designed sparklewolves, one would wonder why the fuck anybody would care, yet somehow the [[DeviantART|general public]] manages to [[fangirl]] her horrendous evolutionary dropouts:

*'''[http://blueshinewolf.deviantart.com/art/Assuva-Character-Study-139172094/ Assuva]''': This glaringly bright red wolf is the main target of her h8rs. It is not the trolls' fault, however, that she picked a name that starts with [[ass]]. But you see, according to Blueshine, having a character with disproportionate anatomy and 100% saturation coloring does not make him a [[sparkledog]]. Exhibit 1 as to why she is a [[retard]].

*'''[http://blueshinewolf.deviantart.com/art/Moon-2010-design-139871941/ Moon]''': Note the ttly original name. Despite the fact that Moon has anime hair and is white with unnatural bright fucking blue markings, [[Retard|Blueshine insists she is not a sparkledog.]] Like any [[Unoriginal|good]] main character, Moon has several [[Kay Fedewa|very original rage forms]] she can switch into. She's also an [[emo]] pussy [[Mary Sue]] of a wolf who lives in [[Wapanese|Japan]] and [[Wat|speaks with a British accent.]] [[Mary Sue|Oh, and she's the alpha of her pack and the CHOSEN one to save her pack, of course.]] Way to fuckin' go.
Another thing about her character is: that it’s STOLEN!!! Yes, stolen. Bullshit have stolen Moon’s design from -> [http://silverpoot.deviantart.com/art/Doggie-V-S-AiruKitty23-20339445?fullview=1 Airukitty23] and [http://koalakitty23.deviantart.com/art/Our-Beautiful-Babiez-20136112 Koalakitty23]. Just look at the date: 2005!!! OMG! And what about our lovable  Shitwolf: [http://blueshinewolf.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=240#/d1rfug9 first pic of Moon in her gallery], it's from 2008. Freaking 3 years later. 

{{quote|I don't get it. How? How does my comic look like hers. It pretty much sounds like if Kay Fedewa has wolf fights or red wolves in her comic,that anyone else who has wolf fighting and red wolves in their comic is copying.Kay Fedewa has a completely different storyline than mine. I would never copy her ideas,nor do I intend to in the future of my comic. Please guys, I don't appreciate that. And it's not only me,I've seen it around DA as well. And frankly,I don't think it's fair.| BSW fails to recognize a clone when she sees one}} 

Here we have Blueshine, [[Crybaby|bawwing]] in her journal when people pointed out the many similarities between her and [[Kay Fedewa]]'s comic BBA - both have red wolves, dire wolves, giant wolf wars, and a female character with rage mode. Not to mention the nearly identical designs and styles.

Blueshine was pissed by the accusations and seemed to conveniently forget that a few weeks prior she'd posted this:

{{quote|please respect my copyrights.i put a lot of thought into my characters,and it's really flattering if you like him,but i do not like it when you copy him.that goes for all of my characters. that last copy off was pretty similar.i'll tell you how,not to mention some others i've seen.

assuva:
markings:red fur,white belly,tail,face,paws.black wing markings,leg markings,face markings.
comic character
rank:captain
age: older wolf

copy offs
markings:red fur,white belly,tail,face,paws.black wing markings,leg markings,face markings.
comic character
rank:captain
age: older wolf|BSW cares about her brilliant original characters}}

Got that, people? One comic can't claim red and black wolves as their own! That's totally unfair! But if you make a red and black wolf, Blueshine will jump your ass. Oh hello, [[hypocrite|hypocrisy]].

==BUT IT'S MY STYLEEE!==
[[Image:Bswolfcomment1.png|thumb|right|[[Chris Crocker|LEAVE BLUESHINEWOLF ALONE]]!!!]]
[[Image:Blueshine is a hypocrite.jpg|thumb|Blueshine hates neon colours. Oh the hypocrisy...]]
[[Image:Bswnomorewolvs.PNG|thumb|right|sick of wolves!?]]

Blueshine constantly receives constructive criticism from artists who can actually fucking draw and know what they're talking about regarding her deformed doggies. However, she has never been known to reply to the comments. Uncharacteristic of your typical [[tartlet]]: the typical reaction would be to suck up to the popular and talented artists.<br/>But it's okay guys, because it's just her [[shit|totally unique style!]] She is the epitome of originality. [[lies|She totally did not rip off Ginga.]] 

===Early Period===
Blueshine has ripped off pretty much every sparkledog on the face of the [[Internet]]; probably having even traced several drawings form cartoons for a while, judging by the huge style changes before discovering Kay Fagewa and her [[shit|beautiful]] comic.

===Kay Period===
When Blueshine discovered Kay, she saw the light that day and decided to suck KF's cock by writing a shitload of journals saying she will one day make a comic featuring [[sparkledog|colourful wolves]].

===The Animu Movement===
People got suspicious so she ripped off {{deviantart|SilverDeni|SilverDeni's}} former [[animu]] style when she noticed it getting popular. Within a few submissions, Blueshine went from [http://blueshinewolf.deviantart.com/art/totally-random-76224689 this style] to [http://blueshinewolf.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=96#/d2c8dxq this shit], and we knew she had finally settled on the horribly deformed [[anime|Ginga Densetsu Crackhead]] style and lived happily ever after. Her wolves have huge heads, dipped backs, and maws that look like annoying rectangles just thrown together and are always open in a "GASP" expression throughout her whole comic. The only difference between Ginga and Blueshine is that Ginga doesn't have [[Lopunny|fucking ridiculously huge ears]] half the size of their heads, and hers are way more furry than necessary.<br/>BlueshineWolf is the only person who can draw worse dog anatomy than Ginga.

===Creation of a Master===
But this isn't enough for her, oh no. Like many Tartlets, Blueshine will defend her shitty-ass sparkledog art to the death. It's her style guys! She can draw whatever she wants! Fuck all that garbage about [[science|color theory, symbolism, and cohesive designs]]!
 
===Another Animal to Rape===
Blueshine's new obsession is big [[pussy|cats]]! By some miracle, they actually have natural colors. It seems as if she had just discovered feline artists such as [[Dolphy]], Evana, and Balaa. That, or she just finished watching The [[Lion King]]. Of course she can't draw them though, [[Facepalm|without giving them the anatomy of a dog.]]

==I DO NOT WANT YOUR FUCKING CRITIQUE.==
[[Image:BSW CRITIQUEEE.jpg|thumb|180px|right|She decided this why? [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/4102693/1455709617 Oh yeah.]]]
[[Image:Blueshinewolf_has_issues.png|thumb|100px|right|One of the profits: Sprakledog [[emo]] moments.]]

Painfully simple, yet painfully effective. Blueshine haets critique and will proceed to bitch you out or send her fans to attack you. Because, let's face it, she's clearly a [http://blueshinewolf.deviantart.com/art/Heart-of-Courage-184394563?q=gallery%3Ablueshinewolf%2F114850&qo=10/ Master]  [http://blueshinewolf.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d2ym9yt/ Of]  [http://blueshinewolf.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=48#/d2hd9zr/ Anatomy].<br/> Remember kids, screencap any lulz you see immediately - Blueshine is infamous for [[DELETING FUCKING EVERYTHING]].

===WAIT- CRITIQUE PLZ!===
After some flaming and a few kicks in the ass, she's decided to accept critique. Blueshine, herself, has finally realized how shitty she is, and how pissed off people were getting when she wouldn't accept critique. The rules probably still apply, though, since she only accepts "nice" critique. Good luck with that, kid.<br/>If you want to troll Blueshine, it's a very simple process.

#Go to her [http://www.blueshinewolf.deviantart.com/ DeviantArt] page
#Find a picture that doesn't have comments disabled (rare) or just her front page
#Write a critique of her art/methods that doesn't asspat her.
#?????
#PROFIT!

====Sample Critique====
*Your lines are fucking wobbly.
*Your chins are fucking huge.
*Maybe START YOUR FUCKING COMIC ALREADY?
*Stop using crappy photoshop brushes for your background and not crediting for them.
*Now, how about trying some realism? There is not a single picture in your gallery that IS FUCKING REAL!
*Stop denying that you draw sparkledogs. Just accept it and move on.
*Make Moon, y'know... less of a MARY SUE!
*Move on from wolves. You're 15 now, girl.
*Can you do any other expression other than "GASP!111" ?
*Stop acting like you are so freakin popular.
*Internship at disney... right.
*Start fucking studying anatomy. The "wolves" you draw now look like boneless Akitas with back problems.
*Start fucking studying character design. There is more to a character than LOL SHE HAS HAIR
*Start fucking studying character archetypes. All your characters are the either so bland you don't notice them or agonizingly cliche.
*Start fucking studying form. Your foxes look like dogs. Your wolves look like dogs. Your cats look like dogs. Etc.
*Start fucking studying storytelling. If you wanna rip from [[Kay Fedewa]] at least make it have substance and not make it very boring/cliche.
*Start fucking studying color theory. Stop using bi-colored sparklewolves with blindingly saturated coloration, it is far from natural.
*Spend more than 5 minutes on your art and actually implement line variation and not-lazy coloring.
*Learn to do your own damn backgrounds. You're going to piggyback off someone while you make cash off it? Nice.
*Stop concentrating on trying to whore out your character toys and posters and actually try to improve.
*You have 3 webcomics going simultaneously. Slow the fuck down.
*Draw something other than shiney animu animals for once. Goddamn.
*If you say you don't care about [[Anonymous|Whining comments]], then STOP FUCKING REPLYING TO THEM!!

==Twilight Spirits - Animooted!==
Because ''Twilight Spirits'' was in SUCH high demand, Blueshine decided to create a {{ytuser|blueshinewolf2|Youtube account}} to showcase [[anime|animations]] for ''Twilight Spirits: The Animated Series!'' While she's still looking for someone with a convincing [[British]] accent to play Moon (seriously), you can check out some of her [[shit|wonderful]] animations in the meantime! Warning: The following may cause seizures.

==Blueshine Vs. Fanbase==
It doesn't really matter if a character was created over [[At_least_100_years_ago|100 years ago]] or [[Last thursday]], it is obviously ripped off of Twilight Spirits! Most of Blueshine's [[drama]] comes from <s>her fanbase itself</s> herself while whining that everyone copies her designs. The obvious response is that people do it for the [[profit]]. It's clear that her fans respect their idol greatly when they start creating look-a-like's of her characters. And of course ol' Nikki does nothing to stop them because she's just another [[attention whore]].
