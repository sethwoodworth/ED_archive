God Mode
[[Image:GodMode2.jpg|thumb|right|A little known fact about the purple-haired kid is that he was born with a dick on the back of his head, as is demonstrated by the author's idea of an IRL [[internet tough guy]] in pannel two. FAP!]]Every online [[webcomic]] is an unfunny snorefest of varying degrees. Sure, you got garbage like ''[[CTRL ALT Delete]]'' and ''[[VG Cats]]'', but then you find things like ''[[God Mode]]''. ''God Mode'' is the end result of combining the most untalented [[fucktard]] in existence with worst [[webcomic]] the internet can offer. Done by ace comedian and artist Ryan Kerns, each page has about as much humor and style as the [[Pain series]]. It follows the story of a bald protagonist who reviews video games. With him are some [[whores]], some dumb guy who works there too, and a boss who's an [[animu]] tough chick with an attitude that beats up the male characters. Already starting off at the height of originality, most of the comics consist of Nintendo fanboys showing their ultra gaming knowledge, and the chain-smoking whore boss beating up the bald kid for getting an erection while playing ''[[Battletoads]]''. ''God Mode'' was chosen by a panel of six judges as the [[The cancer that is killing /b/|cancer that is killing the internet.]] In fact, the only funny thing that has ever come from this violent mark on the internet is his good bye thread on his own forum, which the first page of comments were nothing but "This comic fucking sucked."

==New Leadership==
After being scared off by his lack of popularity, Ryan went on to photograph anorexic whores and cry himself to sleep. He was replaced by some other [[faggot]] Mexican named Raven Perez who actually has some degree of comedic talent in comparison. While the first comics were [[Skuee]] bad, these were only regular bad. Now, apparently, it's written and drawn by someone named Adrian Ramos, and the art has gotten worse and the writing horribly dull - way too dull to effectively mock.

==Popularity==
God Mode only started receiving some degree of attention after it was discovered by [[4chan]]'s /v/. Much like any other gaming webcomic, the strips were mocked from dusk till dawn. Unlike [[Penny Arcade|BALD]] edits and the 2-Panel trick used for [[Tim buckley|CAD]], [[Anonymous]] could do nothing to improve these horrid abominations. All Anon could do was stand by and read them, brain cells dying from speech bubble to speech bubble. But there was hope! /v/ proceeded in posting "Funnier than Godmode comics"! These consisted of stale jokes like "poop" and the sort. The mocking of ''God Mode'' by 4chan was the height of the comic's popularity. After Raven and then Adrian took over, Anonymous stopped caring about God Mode. In reality Anonymous never cared.
