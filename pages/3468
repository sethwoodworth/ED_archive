Graphical User Interface
A '''Graphical User Interface''' (GUI, often pronounced GOO-ey) is a point-and-click computer interface used by pussies who don't know how to use [[command line]]. For example, when you are watching that video of [[Goatse|Kirk Johnson]] fisting himself, you are using a GUI.

==History==
One of the first GUI's was PARC, which had windows, toolbars, and other common features of what we would consider a GUI. 

==Modern GUI's==
The most popular Graphical User Interface systems today include [[Apple|OS X]], [[Windows]], and [[IBM]] OS, but only [[faggots]] use these.

==Lunix==
[[Lunix]] is an operating system that offers a GUI but can be programmed to run without one for those who are [[man]] enough.
