==Prologue==
It should be noted that the Fifty Hitler Post concept can be applied to anything else. In a [[flame war]], the opponent can be silenced by posting their own picture fifty times. This works particularly well if they are ugly. [http://community.livejournal.com/dc_snark/29657.html?thread=228313#t228313]

==The Traditional Fifty Hitler Post==

# Firstly, make sure the situation warrants a 50 Hitler post. See Godwin Variation for more info on this.
# Go to [[google|Google images]] and find a good picture of [[Hitler]].
# Use [[HTML]] to make an image tag pointing to the URL of the picture.
# Copy and paste that 10 times, and then copy and paste that block 5 times, so that you get 50 Hitlers. Make sure you have no line breaks in between, but that you do have spaces, so that it wraps. See '''Variations''' below.

==Variations==
''Some say there are fifty variations of the Fifty Hitler Post.  Here are a few:''
# '''The Video Hitler''' - Embed [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4xHwtGwBc8 This video] into your post. Very useful if you wanna draw that extra little bit of attention to your Fiddy Hiddy or if the forum you're on won't let you post images.
# '''The Horizontal''' - Make sure there are no line breaks in between the Hitlers; wrap the whole thing with a NOBR tag. Gets its name from the horizontal scroll bar it creates, not from the [[sex|horizontal mambo]].
# '''The Mexican''' - Add a [[marquee]]. The '''Triple Mexican''' uses three marquees.
# '''The Vertical''' - Line break in between each IMG SRC. AKA '''The Middle Finger''', for the extended movement of your middle finger on the mouse scroll wheel to get through the comment. See example below.[http://my.opera.com/Pokemon%20Masters/blog/2007/06/03/pokemon-diamond-and-pea?cid=21808611#comment21808611 epic middle finger]
# '''Hitler!''' - with added sound (either circus music, NAZI anthem, [[media:YakitySax.mp3]], or a [[YTMND]]). Not possible on [[LiveJournal]] but some of the more insecure sites (such as [[MySpace]]) might allow this.
# '''Chinese Water Torture''' - only posting one Hitler in a comment, but repeating the comment every minute. Even if the user checks his email every minute, he is still guaranteed to have at least one image of Hitler in his inbox every time. Also harder to delete (although the user can still delete the entry). 
# '''Stalin''' - Fifty images of Stalin in succession. Can be used as a response to a Hitler post, although you will still lose.
# '''Birthday Hitler''' - Download the Hitler image and [[Photoshop]] it, adding a birthday hat. Then upload and post as Traditional. Note: you may only make a Birthday Hitler post on your birthday, or on an LJ entry where it's the [[OP]]'s birthday.
# '''Where's Waldo''' - One of the 50 Hitlers is a different image of Hitler.
# '''Andy Warhol''' - use photoshop to make Andy-Warhol-style poster of 50 Hitlers.
# '''The Txt Only''' - for text-only browsers and dial-up users, a "50HP Lite" version was created. Just write "hitler.jpg" fifty times. Can be used with any of the above.
# '''Fifty Furries''' - Replace the Hitler image in any of the above with an image of a [[furry]]. Bonus points if it's a furrified Hitler. 
#'''Fifty Terri Schiavos''' - Replace the Hitler image with an image of [[Terri Schiavo]].  As she is now dead, the [[lulz]] associated with this will be minimal, and this has already become an [[old meme]]. The best use of [[Terri Schiavo]] would be in a "Where's Waldo" variation, either with a single Terri among 49 Hitlers, or reversed, with a single Hitler hidden among 49 [[Terri Schiavo]]s. alternately, one could just [[Photoshop]] a Hitler mustache onto Terri's face (this method works with other dead [[retard]]s such as [[Superman]]).
#'''Fifty Natalee Holloways''' [http://www.livejournal.com/users/ohbutyouwillpet/9378.html?thread=444834#t444834 first ever!]
#'''Fifty Ironic Hitlers''' - While the Fifty Hitler Post is almost always [[irony|ironic]] (since such a post works best if there is no mention of Hitler beforehand), the FIH variation pushes the ironic envelope to the max. This can be done by incorporating images of the Star of David or Alanis Morrissette (offshoot of aforementioned "Where's Waldo" variation)
#'''Fifty Preview Post''' - A technique first applied by [[George W. Bush]], an example can be found [[User talk:Neue Wache|here]]. There exists however one rule: the subject must be a [[homosexual]] and/or a [[Hitler]][[fan]]atic.
#'''480 [[Brian Peppers|Bpeps]] Post''' - First used on the [[Brian Peppers]] community on [[LiveJournal]]. [http://www.livejournal.com/community/brian_peppers/59950.html?view=740654#t740654 First EVAR!1]
#'''50 Seizure Post''' - Preferably used when targetting epileptic or just [[Asperger's Syndrome|ass pie]] children in general. [http://www.livejournal.com/users/enochfallax/20629.html?view=181653#t181653 Exempli Gratia]
#'''50 Lollercaust Post''' - Preferably used when someone makes a moronic comparison of something to the Holocaust, [http://community.livejournal.com/anti_bisexual/39556.html?thread=1022084#t1022084 such as associating people who think bisexuality is fake to Holocaust revisionists. (First ever!)]
#'''50 [[Ana]] Post''' - Great to hide behind the [[lj-cut]] of an application to a [[rating community]].  [http://www.evernex.com/livejournal/20060121/lol.htm 1sT eVa!!1] (actually only a 20 ana post)
#'''50 Jiminy Glick Post''' - Original Jimmy Glick 50 [http://community.livejournal.com/_got_emo_/57186.html?view=453730#t453730 here!] This post was eventually deleted by a bunch of angry emos. 
#'''Fifty Ron Jeremy Post''' - Ideal for underage kiddies. [http://www.myspace.com/streakingguy  First EVAR!!!] (recently deleted unfortunately).
#'''Fifty Meth-Head Post''' - Delivers megatons of offense to impressionable, ditzy [[16 year old girls]] who randomly write poems about how, like, bad drugs are or how we need to save the kittens. May garner [http://city-glitter.livejournal.com/847289.html?thread=4551609#t4551609 LJ abuse threats].
#'''[[A thousand flaming penguins]]'''
#'''Fifty Hard Gay Post''' - Sometimes known as the ''Fifty Haado Gei Post''. Involves fifty continuous images of Masaki Sumitani dressed in black leather as his Razor Ramon Hard Gay persona. Bonus points if the image is an animation of Hard Gay doing pelvic thrusts. Even more bonus points if you can get ''Livin' La Vida Loca'' by Ricky Martin to play in the background.
#'''Fifty Stavros Post''' - CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL. What more needs to be said?
#'''Caecilius est in horto [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caecilius_est_in_horto] Post''' - First evar!!!111oneeleven [http://zapruder.livejournal.com/448517.html?thread=2706181#t2706181]
#'''Fifty Matthew Shepard Post''' - [http://community.livejournal.com/new_gay_boys/459038.html]Great for {{ljcomm|user=new_gay_boys}} or [[User:Neurogeezer]].
#'''Fifty [[Hasselhoff]] Post''' - [http://zionistacat.livejournal.com/4375.html?thread=17687#t17687] Great for recruiting more [[lesbian]]s
#'''Fifty ASCII Hitler Post''' - Previously thought to be solely theoretical, the Fifty Hitler Post is made up pictures of Hitler made up of ASCII characters. It can not be image files to be a true Fifty ASCII Hitler Post. This would both be able to match the Horizontal and Vertical normal versions in size due to the amount of characters needed to do make a recognizable image. It would be extremely difficult, to the level of the following styles as it would require both m4d sp4c1ng skillz and m4d l1ne br34k1ng skillz. Attempting this would most likely cause m4d c4rp4l tunn3l c4s3z. (Note: This is not the same as the one shown below. I'm talking about full-sized Hitler faces of an artistic level of quality, [http://ascii50hitler.freehost10.com/ like this].)
#'''[[9000|Nine Thousaaaaaaaand!!!!]] Hitler Post''' - Few things can match the dangerousness of this concept when implemented as it has the possibility of crashing browsers if used properly.  If possible combine it with other styles like The Horizontal, The Vertical, Chinese Water Torture, or the every image is a different picture methods. One thing of note is that this would probably be used to best effect with pictures of [[Vegeta]]. (Because there's [[Furry|almost]] nothing [[lol|funnier]] than 9,000 pictures of a walking hormone with [[gay|constipation]].) When this method is combined with the Fifty Hitler Post Post it becomes a weapon of mass bandwidth/forum destruction. Note: This was accomplished at 13:37 in the poster's local timezone ([[srsly]]) at [http://russserv.inventforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=239 http://russserv.inventforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=239](If someone can pull this off on a forum with active mods before getting [[banhammer|banhammered to oblivion]] please provide a link.)
#'''(Fifty Hitler Post)<big>Â²</big>''' - posting a fifty Hitler post fifty times. If you succeed in posting a FHP fifty times without getting interrupted by a [[banhammer]], you get to join the exclusive [[lemonparty|Fifty High Club]].
#''''Five [[Tay Zonday]] Post'''' - posting five Tay Zondays, stepping away to breathe in and then posting five [[moar]]. Repeat as required
#''''The Meta-Hitler'''' - posting smaller images of Hitler in the shape of Hitler's face, so when you step back and view it from a distance, it looks like a giant picture of hitler.
