Maturity
[[Image:Fucktard.jpg|thumb|Maturity at its finest]]
Maturity by definition is the measurement of one's ability to overcome life's obstacles without giving in to [[emo|emotions]], anger, as well as refrain from creating unnecessary [[drama]].  People who are mature are [[mundane|normal]] people who can laugh at themselves, admit their flaws, and not dwell on [[shit nobody cares about]].  Here is a short list on people who can be considered mature:

*People who are not [[teenager]]s
*People who are not [[Leftarded]]
*People who are not [[Conservative]]
*People who use common sense instead of giving into emotions (IE: Not being a [[woman]])
*People who face their problems instead of running away from them (IE: Not being a [[man]])
*People who do not have [[trigger]]s
*People who do not [[Yahoo Answers|turn to the internets asking 13 year olds to solve their problems]]
*[[EDiot|People with a sense of humor]]
*People with [[opinion]]s

Sadly, mature people make up a small [[White people|minority]] on the internets and recently have been put on the endangered species list.  With the stupidity-nurturing world of [[Web 2.0]] in combination with [[MTV]], VH1, Fuse, and teenagers living in [[suburbs]], the true definition of "Maturity" will soon be erased from the pages of history.

People who are truly mature do not need to advertise their maturity, because their actions basically speak for themselves.  Ironically people who are the '''''least''''' mature use the word as a weapon to claim superiority over their rivals.  These people are the dreaded [[teenager]]s, who constantly feel the need to [[attention whore|assert themselves]] as being more grown up and smarter than they will ever dream to be.

The worst offenders are unsurprisingly [[16 year old girls]].  Their constant self-righteousness, inability to solve any problem without threatening [[suicide]], [[cutting]],  use of drama generating techniques, throwing a hissy fit over bullshit like the [[Toilet Seat]], and inability to shut the fuck up  makes them the epitome of immaturity.  One of the most annoying traits is the use of [[trigger]]s which these girls in their fevered self-righteous mindset use as an excuse to flip out at people without critical reprisal because of their "[[almost raped|traumatic past]]" which is 99.9999999[[%]] [[lies]] or bloated exaggerations.

I am sure that if any of you who has spent even one day in high school, you would have heard someone try to win an argument with no supporting evidence or any reasoning either than the claim that they are more mature than you or calling the other person immature (calling them "ignorant" is also used a lot).

== Immaturity Into Adulthood ==

Part of [[Puberty|growing up]] is learning from ones mistakes, swallowing ones pride and realizing that you might be responsible for your own failures instead of constantly playing the [[victim complex|victim]].  Unfortunately, a growing amount of adults will refuse to mature thanks to chronic exposure to the internets.  [[Immaturity]] in adults affects mainly [[basement-dweller]]s who refuse to accept the harsh realities of the real world.  The big problem is any "[[furry|stupid behavior]] no matter how wrong it is, there will have a special place on the internet where it is "accepted".  This growing acceptance is the reason why we have so many adults prancing around in [[furry|fursuits]] and [[babyfur|diapers]] without being dragged out into the street and shot.  A perfect example of an immature adult is the former lordy-assface of DeviantART, the yellow alien [[Jark]], who took his cyberjob so [[serious|seriously]] he tried to rally an uprising and donation to his [[faggotry|cause]].

== Notable Immature Behavior ==

*Use of [[trigger]]s
*[[Pro-Ana]]
*[[Suicide]]
*[[Internet Disease]]
*[[Nice Guys|Nice Guy]] syndrome (AKA: Permavirgin)
*Use of "[[Bros B4 Hoes]]" catchphrase.
*Claiming any sort of [[mental illness]] to excuse your dumbassery
*Use of [[Sob Story|sob stories]]



As a final note, there is a silver lining here in a world full of [[immaturity]].  These people are the most vulnerable targets to [[trolling]], therefore the world has an endless untapped supply of [[lulz]].  Long after all the earths [[vespene gas|natural resources]] are used up, there will still be drama-a-plenty.
