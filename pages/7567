'''Slash Firestorm''' is known as a "popular writer" (we use the term loosely) on [http://anime.adultfanfiction.net/authors.php?no=1296803608 AdultFanFiction.net]. In his [[fanfiction]] he likes to portray himself as an angst-y [[Faggot|badass]] who uses [[Pokemon|POKEMON]] AS WEAPONS and "THE CHOSEN ONE" who will save the world! He is in fact a psychotic shadow of a 23-year-old man living in [[white_trash|Pensacola, Florida,]] an all-around furfag, and clearly a [[Retard|man who does not liek]] [[Mudkip|mudkips]] since he only writes about [[Pedophile|fucking a Gardevoir.]]

Since his most popular <s>original stories</s> [[Self-insert|self-inserts]] are Pokémon-based, Slash is of course not a [[closet furry|furry]], and neither are his fans. The fans are [[retard|"special"]] at best, since the vast majority of them are unable to write a proper sentence to express a coherent thought. This works to Slash's advantage since his writing is on par with their limited intelligence.

[[Image: Slashfat.jpg|thumb|"Look, its a bug! That's, like, almost a Pokémon! ...Does that mean I can fuck it?"]]
Slash Firestorm, or Jason [[Powerword|outside of the Internet]], is a Canadian-born but American-raised [[lol-cow]] that likes [[Al Gore|nature]] and "creative activities". He is a former [[homophobe]] who has recently embraced his inner [[Gay|gay/bi]] self. According to his [[MySpace]] ([http://www.myspace.com/slashfirestorm oh yes, he has one]), his "ideal mate" would have to enjoy running around in the [[Chocolate Rain|rain]], love watching [[Porn|movies]], and have a sense of [[Uncyclopedia|humor]]. Besides the inference that Slash is, in fact, a [[virgin]], we can safely assume that any girl who enjoys said things would drop Slash faster than a live grenade when she saw what horrors he has wrought in the name of "art."

[[Politics|Politically]], according to his [http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/blog/slashfirestorm defunct pro-Obama blog], Slash is a [[conservative]] but was turned off by eight years of the [[Bush]] administration, so he now supports [[Obama]]. Slash thinks he holds a modicum of progressive ideals, but more likely than not they serve as fetish fuel for whatever wank story disguised as a [[Final Fantasy|MEANINGFUL TALE]] he's writing this time. Obama's presidency is failing due to Slash's support.

Like any good [[basement dweller]], Slash is a fervent participant in [[Newgrounds]] and [[LiveJournal]]. He is surprisingly ineffective at both because he fails to make any sort of impact or impression, just like anything outside of the insulated world of Pokémon adult fanfiction. It doesn't help that he wastes his time writing the same post in three different blogs (he doesn't [[copypasta]]) instead of putting it all in one place. Then again, he may be preparing for the eventual trolling that will hit him like [[Hurricane Katrina]] thanks to his presence in the [[Internet|tubes]].
 
Lastly, Slash Firestorm is a [[Fat|massive]] fucking [[attention whore]] who [[BAWWW]]ed in the talk pages about how this article doesn't meets his own [[Fail|EPIC]] writing and humor standards. One would think he is trying to suck an [[Admin|admin's]] cock on [[TOW|Wikipedia]], but [[This is Sparta|this is ED]] and we tire of that [[B&|shit quickly]].

== His "Art" ==
[[Image:99542 Sexy Gardevoir 58 122 509lo.jpg|thumb|left|You would think Psymakio would be a [[Shiny pidgey|shiny Gardevoir]] the way Slash treats her.]]
Slash Firestorm has written numerous short stories and fanfics, all of which are absolute dreck. There's a common formula to all of them, which only adds to the fail. His protagonists are all called [[Mary Sue|Slash Firestorm]] (NOT A SELF-INSERT!), the female love interest to Slash Firestorm all have unpronounceable names like [[WTF|Psymakio]], and there's a [[Sephiroth|main villain]] who [[Oh noes|Slash Firestorm would be like]] if he didn't have the [[Hate|love]] of the oddly-named female protagonist. [[Shit no one cares about|There's a theme of this trinity of characters who transcend any one story, and this bizarre love triangle often tries too hard to explain good, evil, and how love bridges the two]]. In other words, Slash Firestorm writes the same story repeatedly, naming the protagonist after himself (but he's NOT A SELF-INSERT!), using the same character guidelines, changing only the setting, the words, and a couple of names. Sounds more like [[copypasta]] than "art".

Slash Firestorm [[Delete fucking everything|BALEETED]] his old non-''Sinners''-related work from AdultFanFiction.net. Because of this, he has no idea that he in fact sucks as much now as he did in the past. If he believed in self-improvement and was an artist that didn't have a severe case of [[unwarranted self-importance]], he would have kept this past work not only for the [[lulz]] of it all but also to gauge how to best improve his abilities, but like any artist on the internet, he doesn't. However, we know for certain that he has written stuff about ''The [[Legend of Zelda]]: Wind Waker'' and ''Golden Sun''.

So what problems are present in his work? Read on and find out for yourself!

|For a moment the thought came back to him---the idea of simply giving up now, throwing in the towel, accepting his impending corruption and the horrible death that would soon follow. Leaving now would spare his friends...and his mate...a great deal of heartache and trouble. Perhaps even their lives. She would get over it. She was strong. She---|From ''Shadows of the Night''.  Slash is thinking of [[an hero|pwning himself]], which would be the best Christmas present of all.

|"I...wow, Gardevoir...you're...wow," Slash stammered, not really the least bit prepared to see her fully undressed, even as horny as he was. She was a stunning thing of beautiful, soft skin, liquid moonlight in female form...small in build, yes, but more than enough to satisfy him. The blue stickiness of the lollipop dotted her cheek, neck, and the upper portion of her chest, contrasting on her pale skin...and yes, despite his shellshock at the sheer beauty of the angel before him, he was still very up to the task.|From ''How Many Licks Does It Take''.... Slash has a [[loli]] fetish.

|I have done some terrible things in my life, and I will tell you about them. The fact that I was crafted by some terrible people does not justify my actions. But I'll tell you about those people, too. You will hear about the Dark Man and his little science project. You will hear about how we nearly destroyed this world, he in his nihilistic rage and me in my unconscionable ignorance. You will hear how I rebelled and escaped from his grasp, only to foolishly attempt the same kind of evil myself. I did not learn my lesson quickly enough.|From ''Janus''. This is [[Mewtwo]]. Yes, the anime's Mewtwo.

|A readout flickered over the device on Kiako's face, and the dark man's expression suddenly turned ominous. "You take me for a fool, do you? It's on your person. And you will pay the price for your attempts at deceit. Magmortar, incinerate this worm. The Pearl is indestructible, so do not worrying about holding back."|From ''Sinners'', Chapter 3. Everyone speaks like this.

|"Actually, Kirlia...I, uh...I see it like this. Pokemon are clearly sentient creatures, able to consent or turn down...advances...from people. Since they are capable of making a choice, I don't think it should be anyone's concern what humans and Pokemon...do." He felt his face redden another shade and tried (and failed) to shake it off. "That's not a very...popular opinion...and I would almost certainly lose my trainer license if I publicly advocated it...but that's how I feel."|From ''Sinners'', Chapter 5. Slash supports [[bestiality]].

|The two sat in silence in the dim room, enjoying each other’s company, before Slash whispered something.

“Psymakio.”

"Hmm?"

“I...I was thinking you could be named Psymakio. It makes me...think of you.”

"How so?"

“Well, I was thinking of some foreign names, because I couldn't think of any common ones that seemed to suit you, and ‘Miyako’ came to me...it means...” he smiled shyly as he continued, “...'beautiful night child'.”

Her breath caught as she heard that. "Master..."

“But it didn’t sound exactly right...the name itself, I mean...so I changed it a bit. Made it sound more...suited to you. But it’ll mean the same thing to me. Whenever I look at you...your beautiful silver skin...it makes me think of moonlight and silver taking the form of an angel, so...”|From ''Sinners'', Chapter 13. Every "love talk" is sappier than [[Twilight]]'s.

|Now listen to me closely, and mark my words well. Fate is not tolerant of stupidity, but it is, on occasion, merciful towards love...particularly young love. It spared the pair this time, allowing their kiss to go unnoticed amongst the flowered fields of the pass, preventing any prying eyes from falling upon them...but I tell you, readers, that fate's patience and mercy has its limits.|From ''Sinners: Arc 2'', Chapter 3. Meet the [[Olngact|omnipresent narrator]]. He'll be around a long time.

|There was a sort of magic in the room, and everyone, psychic or not, seemed to feel it. Perhaps it was the very faint and subconscious bond that Gardevoir had begun weaving amongst those gathered here over the past two weeks...but that didn't diminish the sensation.

"This may be our last palaver for quite some time," Watson said quietly. "Whatever lays ahead of you is going to be very dangerous."|From ''Sinners: Arc 2'', Chapter 4. Hey kids! Can you find out where this started to suck? I'm sure you can!

|I'm so sorry, Psymakio, I'm so fucking sorry. I shouldn't have...done any of this. All my actions...trying to protect you but instead ripping you apart...I did exactly what that Shadow wanted, followed its every lead, letting myself be controlled like a puppet...and now what can we do? How I can ever make up for what I've done?|From ''Sinners: Arc 2'', Chapter 7. Do you feel that? That's the ANGST, son!

|'''YOU CONSORT WITH HUMANS? HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN YOUR BLOODLINE, CHILD, TO BETRAY YOUR OWN KIND BY LAYING WITH THEIRS?'''

I did not forget or betray anything!

'''THEN WHY?'''

Because I love him!|From ''Sinners: Arc 2'', Chapter 13. The "Because I love him/her" answer works IRL. This is a fact. Slash will try it in court when he's hauled in for lolicon material.

|"I will ask you one more time. If you do not answer, I will break every bone in your body and throw you to the monsters in the mountains. If you're lucky, they will wait until you're dead before they begin to eat you. If you're not lucky...well, eating you is the least they can do to you." He paused, letting it sink in, and smiled menacingly. "Where is the Pearl?"|From ''Sinners: Arc 2'', Chapter 13. Out of FUCKING NOWHERE Kiako goes psycho because this story was clearly lacking in EPIC.

Since all of his available "art" revolves around ''Sinners'', it's no surprise that everything he has done recently is focused only on that. From truly awful lesson of Pokémon pornography involving Gardevoir and his (TOTALLY NOT A) self-insert to a parody about Pokémon's Ash Ketchum that's about as funny as a rape trial, Slash Firestorm's creative prowess is on par with the art of [[Kay Fedewa|certain people]] [[Snapesnogger|who also can't take]] [[Daveykins|a lick of criticism]]. What's that, you're saying? Slash Firestorm can't accept criticism? Why, no he cannot! Like any good hack artist on the Internet, Slash Firestorm turns into an [[Internet tough guy]] that thinks he's funny or witty when the merest hint of negative criticism is sent to him.

On the disturbingly fetishistic side, Slash also has a [[The Sandwich Chef|thing with food]] in which he almost always uses a food analogy to convey sex. For example, Slash says [[Imaginary girlfriend|Gardevoir]] smells and tastes like 'vanilla' for nearly an [http://anime.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=600041040&chapter=16 entire chapter]. He also manages to do nearly every sex position in one chapter, except anal, [[No|BUT THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT TIME]]. In the end, the real-life Slash Firestorm is going to [[Dying alone|die alone]].

== His Views on Art, Criticism, and Editing ==
[[Image:Gardyouraep.jpg|thumb|What Slash Firestorm thinks art is.]]
[[Image:slash_mock.jpg|thumb|[[Doing it wrong|Wrong Slash.]]]]

Slash's views on these essentials can be summarized in this short list:
*[[Bullshit|Art evolves only in a loving environment. The more love, the faster evolution occurs]].
*Everything he writes is [[shit|gold]].
*The only valid criticism is pointing out contradictions in plot structure and grammatical/spelling errors.
*If a thesaurus says two words are synonyms, they both mean exactly the same thing and are able to be used in exactly the same context because a thesaurus wouldn't list merely SIMILAR words as synonyms.
*It is OK to break fundamentals of art arbitrarily, even when no point is to be made of it.
*[[fail|EPIC]] is the only true way to write.

Slash honestly believes that to be a good critic, you must first accept the world and enjoy it unconditionally. Only when you have done so, you can give criticism that will allow a story to grow. Unfortunately, nobody told Slash that art is [[The Internet is serious business|SERIOUS BUSINESS]]: historically, artists have been absolute assholes to each other on a scale matched only by [[Goatse]], and negative criticism is absolutely required for any artist [[Fact|to understand that doubt creates art]]. Without a little something called "accountancy", an artist will suck forever, but Slash seems to like mediocrity enough to remain in an eternal [[circle jerk]] with his fans.

Taking a glance at the [http://anime.adultfanfiction.net/review.php?set=read&no=600043169 reviews page] for ''Sinners: Arc 2'', we can see that the majority of reviews are just there to fondle Slash's e-cock, and the few reviews actually trying to critique him are written by fans [[molest|touching]] only on minor plot elements and plot [[ass|holes]]. When the [http://anime.adultfanfiction.net/review.php?set=read&no=600043169&limit=&page=20 negative reviews start to roll in], the [[butthurt]] is so immense that Slash and his fans go to great length to discredit the reviewers just because they don't like the story. Did you get that? Slash and his fans claim the reviewers are not legitimate because '''they don't like the story'''. It was ugly from the get-go because the first reviewer said the Pokémon porn was repulsive. Despite repeated claims from the "trolls" that the reviews were written because [[truth|the entire story was shit]], Slash covered his ears and kept saying that they were just there because they got grossed out by the porn and should have left when they [[RTFM|read the disclaimer]] warning about bestiality.

It doesn't help that Slash takes a condescending, [[Fuck you I'm a dragon|know-it-all attitude]] when dealing with negative critics. He uses the phrase "good sir" as if he were an old [[British|English]] fogey and ignores anything past a certain point when it becomes clear that the review isn't being written to give him a [[rimjob]]. If you're going to review him, you'd better take the K-Y, sing praises about the story, and make your review as saccharine as possible to even be accepted by the ranks of his fans... although [[Lurk moar|why would you want to do that]]?

Perhaps the truly sad part of it all is that Slash Firestorm is not a bad writer with spelling mechanics. He spell-checks, proofreads, and at least SOUNDS pseudo-intellectual, which is usually more than can be said about [[n00bs|many Encyclopedia Dramatica users]].

== ''The Masterpiece'' ==
[[File:Slash's Fantasy.png|thumb|Slash's opinion of ''Sinners''. He wishes it were [[File talk:Slash's Fantasy.png|this awesome]].If you save him youre a Jew.]]
Firestorm's magnum opus of shit, described (perhaps flatteringly) as a "pretentious story penned in gilded pages" by one of ED's [[anonymous]] reviewers, is his EPIC titled [http://anime.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=600041040 ''Sinners''] (now in its [http://anime.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=600043169 second "arc"]). Slash Firestorm's description of this story is "the bond between a [[self-insert|trainer]] and his [[Gardevoir]] [that] goes from devotion to forbidden love---and that love may be [[unrealistic expectations|the only hope the world has left"]]. In case you didn't register it yet, this story is about a relationship between a Pokémon and its trainer, complete with [[Rule 34|graphic sex scenes]]. The fanfic world he [[steal|created]] is so in-depth and convoluted that you'll need a flow chart to keep track of all the characters, alliances, settings, and timelines. The story also happens to dabble in the [[4chan|destruction and corruption of the world]], [[Longcat|the gods]], and all that [[money|Nintendo holds dear]]. Are we feeling the EPIC yet? Before Slash continues updating this monstrosity of nature, he is re-writing and re-editing the entire story so far. This is to everyone's benefit because it means we don't have to see any more of him.

Sinners is a continuous story, divided in 'Arcs' but is to be read as a whole. These are only the factual [[Wat|plot-wise]] happenings, for the entire drama, read it all (if you can survive after it, you win AN INTERNETZ).

The thing is just over 725 pages in length and just concluded its second arc, but Slash Firestorm says that what he has written so far is merely an introduction. How he's going to stretch it [[Over 9000|over 2000]] pages is anyone's guess, but it will likely involve [[Naruto|lots more EPIC filler,]] handy use of the thesaurus, prose purpler than a priapic penis, and maybe some more rape. It doesn't help that the pacing is as slow as a three-legged turtle.

Problems in the story range from overuse of cliches and tropes without any change to them, a thesaurus-influenced word in every third line dropped into casual conversation, self-insertion (BUT THERE ISN'T ANY, REALLY!), spotty morality, purple prose, convenience and coincidence that would shatter the disbelief of even the most hardcore fantasy fan, switching from third-person to narrative without the slightest incoming hint, and a serious need of an editor to cut down filler and extraneous dialogue. The entire concept for the story was influenced by an [[What|erotic Star Wars fanfic featuring incest between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker]], but amazingly that doesn't make it any more horrible than it already is.

So what makes this story so popular? It's hard to say, but drama experts attribute it to the sheer amounts of the [[LiveJournal|elements Angst (An), Emo (Em), and Asperger's (As) in roughly proportional amounts]] packed into each chapter. [[Some argue|Some scientists theorize]] the [[Americunt|common Western teenager]] and young adult basement-dweller of this generation is naturally attracted to these volatile elements. Stories that contain An-Em-As ("enemas") [[Science|attract readers through electromagnetic force]]. It doesn't help that ''Sinners'' is a fanfic about Pokémon: the [[Japanese]] [[anime]] influence exponentially concentrates these elements, and fanfics have a [[Black metal|strange vibration in their words]] that draw thousands of views from [[Wapanese|weeaboos]] and [[cutter]]s everywhere. Regardless, the story is even popular amongst users in 4chan's [[b|/b/]] and the other *chans, which suggests that there are a lot of hidden [[sick fuck]]s in Anonymous's ranks... or else it's just very [[lulz]]y. Now that child rape is present twice, it's probably the former.

But despite all of its popularity and the dubious accolades that Slash Firestorm garnered for himself, a momentary darkness formed on the horizon. The [[troll|dangers and accusations that would be leveled]] at our [[lie|favorite non-self-inserter]] would prove to be more than a mere annoyance, for they would [[oh noes|shake the very core of his foundations as a writer]]... although these foundations were pretty flimsy to begin with.

== The [[EPIC]] of the ''Sinners'' Review War: A Recounting of the Battle ==
[[Image:Demon_Eyes.jpg|frame|center|<center><big><big><span class="co;[I Hath Read Enough!];[Click Here To Read This Epic Tale];0;test5;black"></span></big></big></center>
<span class="test5"><br><p>On the evening of the twenty-seventh of June of the 2008th Year of Our Lord, the lands of the reviews page for ''Sinners'' looked as normal as any other day. Fans of [[retarded|questionable intelligence]] and taste frolicked and danced, watched by the setting sun's lone eye, as they sang their praises to Slash Firestorm for his talents, berated him to pen the next chapter of his epic tale, and pulled up their favorite passages of the Gardevoir/Slash erotic lovemaking to take a few furtive minutes with themselves. Slash Firestorm, lord of the land, busied himself by writing the next chapter of ''Sinners'' in his private study in the highest turret of his castle. He checked the land now and again to take note of his followers' desires, shortly before visiting his LiveJournal, Myspace, and Newgrounds profile to voice some more opinions that none but his most trusted (if absent) e-fiefs would take note of.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it was a normal day, like any other... before the dark cloud appeared, engulfing the last rays of the dying light. This obsidian nimbostratus, as massive as it was featureless, approached the ''Sinners'' land, and many of the fans paused their gay joy to glance up at the nearing fog, confused as to its meaning but inexplicably afraid. Slash glanced out of his window, and when he saw the hanging monster, he ceased his [[masturbation|self-pleasure]] at the latest batch of adulation to regard it in more detail.
</p>
<p>
"This looks bad," the stocky man muttered to himself as he noticed there was no wind pushing the cloud along. "I wonder if-"
</p>
<p>
Slash was suddenly [[fellatio|blown]] back by a foetid gust of wind from the ghastly nimbus, and while at first he didn't understand what was going on, he realized that the cloud was speaking to him.
</p>
<p>
"Slash Firestorm!" the onyx cloud roared as loud as a thousand lions, "I demand you to heed my warnings, and recognize the error of your ways!"
</p>
<p>
A dazed and confused Slash got up, but his answer was a mere "What?" spoken in a whisper. Down below in the review lands, dozens of fans and readers screamed and tried to flee the area, trampling each other underfoot as the strongest and fastest of the lot rushed into Slash's castle, pressing the guards aside as they sought cover from the next blast from the cloud.
</p>
<p>
"Do not pretend you cannot hear me!" the cloud boomed to the background of human screams, "Exit your tower and face me!"
</p>
<p>
Mustering his courage at this sudden threat thanks to adrenaline, Slash pulled up his pants, donned his armor and sword crafted from the finest dwarven steel and elven mythril, and marched down his tower's steps. He couldn't be entirely sure, but he felt [[ceiling cat|an ominous presence that seemed to be watching him from the cloud]], staring at him as he made his way down to the stables. He mounted his finest war horse and galloped alone out of his castle's grounds to the now-empty fields of his review lands.
</p>
<p>
"I am glad to see that you are brave enough to face one that does not bow in your presence, one that does not flinch when you speak to them, one that does not believe you are a master artist in literature," the cloud spoke again, this time softer. "Perhaps there is hope for you yet."
</p>
<p>
"Who are you, demon?" Slash shouted at the cloud, his courage beginning to ebb away. "Why have you come to my lands and called me outside of my home in challenge?"
</p>
<p>
"I am [[anonymous]]", the cloud answered cryptically, "but not in the way you expect me to be. I am but one man, much like yourself."
</p>
<p>
"If you are a man, why are you in a cloud?" the puzzled writer countered.
</p>
<p>
As if by response, the cloud seemed to decrease in size. But voicing an actual answer wasn't the cloud's intention. Before Slash could realize what was going on, the voice in the cloud began to voice a barrage of criticism that buffeted Slash and his horse, and this latter was so frightened that it threw its rider on the ground when it reared back. The criticism of the cloud was strong, but it didn't penetrate the armor that Slash wore.
</p>
<p>
"You are a flawed writer!" the cloud was saying. "Your story, the epic titled ''Sinners'', is an abomination to Creation and all of Art! It is not so much its awful content as its execution! You have crucial writing techniques and ideals that you must work on if you wish to join the ranks of the illustrious artists in all of the lands!"
</p>
<p>
The voice went into further detail, and while Slash was taking it all attentively in horror, a seed of defiance and discontent was planted and began to rapidly bloom in his heart. [[erection|It grew]] the longer the cloud talked, and he began to fear it less and less with every passing second as he [[sex|remounted]] his horse. As the cloud's tirade drew to an end, a number of Slash's more loyal followers had approached him, armed for battle as he was. They still looked apprehensive, but their love for Slash's story and his modest talents had sparked their own bravery.
</p>
<p>
When the voice ceased to speak and paused for a few seconds, evidently waiting for a reply, each of Slash's allies spoke in turn, trying to counter this unknown threat. They claimed that the cloud was merely an [[troll|evil influence without anything of worth to say]], and that it was only trying to sow discontent for its own nefarious use. Slash himself spoke last, but not only did he reply to the cloud, he took the moments after he spoke to reply to his own readers' earlier wishes. Perhaps it was to strengthen his own resolve.
</p>
<p>
The cloud hung silent as it appeared to mull over Slash's defiant response. He had fought back against each of the cloud's accusations, and lastly told it to "elope away", as if this last sarcastic edge would force the cloud back. Before he and his allies knew what was happening, the cloud grew once more, but from its depth came forth a figure cloaked, caped, and armored in darkness, riding down on a chariot pulled by two ghostly, skeletal horses. Yielding a long spear, the figure landed his dark chariot in front of the war party, regarding them coolly and with a hint of disgust.
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps it would help get my message across if you saw me in person," the foe stated. "I am Jack Nativity, [[slashfic|a writer of a different sort]], but unlike you, Firestorm, I am aware of standards that must be adhered to. Moreover, I know that what is required of an artist above all else is the ability to accept criticism."
</p>
<p>
This last statement was the most shocking of all to Slash. Criticism? The idea itself was ludicrous, if this Jack Nativity was to be believed. The only criticism Slash needed to get by was to be pointed towards any contradictions or plot holes in his masterful epic. What need did he require of being pointed out of his idea's executions? Wasn't it enough that he was expressing himself, and that his technique's improvement was not a priority?
</p>
<p>
Slash suddenly charged the dark figure in lieu of parlay, trying to catch the threat off-guard and prevent any of his followers from becoming lured by Nativity's words. As if expecting this, Nativity stabbed out with his spear, forcing Slash to abandon his rush. Taking a cue from their leader, the others also rushed forth, swinging their weapons wildly and screaming bloody murder. Nativity seemed to ignore their blows, however, whether by his armor stopping their blows cold, or their slashes swinging through the dark man's body as if they were attacking a phantom. Whoever this Jack Nativity was, he seemed to be focused on Slash Firestorm alone.
</p>
<p>
As the light-armored Firestorm and the dark-clad Nativity [[buttsex|traded blows in a furious duel]], the two traded further words as well. Nativity, obviously disgusted and even disappointed, listened as Slash called him a troll and told him he was not worth heeding in a short, exasperated reply. Furious at being dismissed so bluntly, Nativity lashed out with his spear in a sudden reversal, catching Slash right on the chest and throwing him clear off his horse and into the grassy knoll.
</p>
<p>
"I thought you had more self-respect as an artist to hear something that doesn't agree with you and challenge it with words rather than with a misapplied feeling of superiority," Nativity began curtly, drawing back his spear and glaring at his fallen foe. "I'll be quick: you are a self-insert. You must research accountancy and self-doubt, as it creates all art. I enjoyed your work because it was shockingly bad and it was fun to tear it apart, not because it was good like your followers here say it is. [[unwarranted self importance|If you're dismissing my criticism just because I am not accepting of your world, you are no artist.]]"
</p>
<p>
Our [[an hero|hero]], puffed up and too proud at having been knocked off his steed, bravely challenged Nativity on the merits of what makes an artist and why the dark menace was no editor. "You are a troll! You are a stuck-up, snobby editor who cannot appreciate the world I created! A critic must ground himself in the work and like it before they can critique it!" Slash ranted, his face turning deeper shades of crimson as he continued his shouting. "You do not know how to read! You are simply here because my story contains Pokémon and humans having sex, despite my warnings! You cannot help me!"
</p>
<p>
As if to reply to his latest rant, Nativity simply whipped his chariot up into the sky. Thinking he had won, Slash got up and brushed himself off as his allies helped him, but before they saw what was happening, two more figures appeared in front of them, where Nativity once stood. One looked just like the black person, but appeared shorter and yielded a sword and a shield. The other was a fully-robed man like an Oriental assassin, yielding two small daggers.
</p>
<p>
The new arrivals didn't give the heroes a time to think: the two were already attacking, and it was with difficulty that they could fight them back, even outnumbering them. All the while, the two began to voice their own concerns with the story, calling themselves Not Jack Nativity, Honest, and Alpha Xi. Slash managed to severely wound the dagger-yielder, Alpha Xi, as he finished his battle speech and killed the smaller Nativity look-a-like after this one angrily noted that if Slash truly was once a troll, he would not have picked a fight with them. Alpha Xi, evidently more willing to talk now that he was hurt and alone, stopped fighting. Confident they'd win if he tried anything, Slash and his party granted him the mercy to talk.
</p>
<p>
"You do not know writing," the assassin began. "You will always be a hack if you dismiss any review that does not begin with praise."
</p>
<p>
"I'm not writing for you," Slash replied coolly. "Likewise, I'm not going to allow your words to poison my lands in the form of a review if it's just to [[attention whore|gather attention]]. Your first tirade, and the little Nativity clone's, have already been purged from the land, and it has been cleansed."
</p>
<p>
"Then continue your work if you wish," Alpha Xi spat bitterly, "but you still have not learned what the art of being a writer is, nor what makes good plot."
</p>
<p>
Incensed by this last comment, Slash replied: "I am quite happy with my writing style, and I know what criticism is supposed to be. You and Jack Nativity think that my writing needs to change because it's too 'EPIC', and that already discredits you. You did not get into the world I have made, which any critic has to do before they can be effective or legitimate. And your friend was right: I should not have replied to you at all."
</p>
<p>
With this last sentence complete, Slash raised his sword to behead his foe, but as it swung out, the sword was stopped dead by a spear's haft. Slash looked up and met Nativity's eyes beneath the latter's helmet. As the assassin mentioned some last words, he was warped away by magicks unknown, but no words were spoken otherwise.
</p>
<p>
"Since continuing to fight further will only hurt someone else, which was not my intention, I will take my leave," the steely voice of Nativity rang, cooler than ice. "I will part with a warning: you do not understand criticism or good writing, even after I tried to explain it to you. You do not understand the purpose of art and editorializing. [[lie|I was here to help you]], not hinder you, but you desired to face me as an enemy. Not a concerned harbinger of art, but an enemy. I will cause no further trouble to you or your flock: continue as you will. May you someday learn to write."
</p>
<p>
That said, Jack Nativity brought his ghostly chariot back into the cloud he rode on, and the nimbus began to roll away, giving way to a natural night. All of Slash's allies were silent, but as if bolstered by the dark warriors' exeunt, Slash Firestorm confidently shouted one last cry to the heavens.
</p>
<p>
"You could never help me, Nativity! Not with your ignorance of my story and willingness to immerse yourself in the Pokémon world I have modified and created with a part of me. My work was everyone's work: my fans helped me, my allies assisted me, and my closest friends aided me. You and your kind, the ignorant, the unable to read, the pitiful realists... You cannot help my story develop, or help me improve. That is because you could not understand, with all of your hate towards the story's [[porn|erotic content]], that a critic or editor must like the material before reviewing it. You would never know what I planned, because you don't know anything! I was not a self-insert! My plot was not predictable! My style is my own! May you someday learn to read!"
</p>
<p>
The battle, which had raged on for a number days and nights, had drawn to a close. The besieged fans within the castle had exited, and to celebrate the victory, a weary Slash called for a holiday for all. The horrors of the war were quickly forgotten by the tenth of August as the fans giddily compared the visions of one of the story's characters as being perfectly accompanied by Coldplay's latest hit, ''Viva la Vida'', as a soundtrack.
</p>
<p>
Life had returned to normal for the land of reviews, but the very same invaders of Slash's dream world had catalogued the war that had raged and brought them to the occult and all-knowing range of Encyclopedia Dramatica, where the battle between lulz and fail was stored forever. Their reasoning was that someday Slash Firestorm would regret keeping memories of the war that would open old wounds and bring along new clouds of darkness to his peaceful land, and maintaining a record of the battle as e-history would be essential for veracity. Only time will tell what happens from here, when the information is compiled and presented...
</p>
<p>
TL;DR EPIC version: An anonymous reviewer posted in the reviews, saying Slash's writing ability sucked, and that the posting was done not because of the Poképorn, but rather because the EPIC was atrocious. Slash got butthurt and replied with anger. The anonymous reviewer, naming himself Jack Nativity, replied again, but Slash's second reply was dismissive and said the reviews were "TL;DR". Nativity replied one more time curtly and Slash got pissed, telling Jack that he was just a troll and had nothing of worth to say because he didn't immerse himself in the story. At this point, two more reviewers, Alpha Xi and Not Jack Nativity, Honest, popped up to give their own two cents. Their replies got promptly deleted, so Alpha Xi delivered a last parting shot or two and Slash replied to him, deleting the true final comment. Jack Nativity also gave one last post insulting Slash Firestorm, but gave Slash the last word and told him he'd not bother him anymore (in the review page). Slash replied to him and finished the matter, thinking he pwnzorzed them.</p>
