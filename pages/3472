'''Grawp''' is Wikipedia’s foremost page-move [[vandal]], and has taken the position that [[Willy on Wheels]] previously occupied, and far surpassing him. Like all sequels, he is [[proxy|tougher]], [[/b/|faster]] and has more devious ways of [[pwnt|wasting the time]] of and [[attack|harassing]] [[sysop]]s on [[TOW]]. He has used countless sockpuppets, and uses every single one to make numerous page-moves, topped off at the end with a personal attack in the unblock request, like the [[cum]]shot that ends a [[porn]]o. It is believed that he is an [[Americunt]] and edits on open proxy, therefore cannot be pwned by [[IP]] directly. He is also a ''[[Harry Potter]]'' [[fanboi]] as evidenced by his username, and his edits tend to reflect an interest in other [[fandom]] [[crap]] such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons|Dungeons & Dragons]]'', although he clearly [[secks|gets laid]] more than Wikipedians do, as proven by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=move&user=&page=Vagina this], and claims to have a [[Big dick|massive cock]]. All of this adds up to him being one of the Wikipedia sysops’ most hated vandals, especially given his purported status as a major [[Slut|ladies’ man]], much to the envy of Wikipedos.

==[[Epic]] Vandalism==
His career [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Grawpy began] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&user=Grawp_the_Giant in] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&user=HAGGGER%3F September] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&user=Grawp 2007], and he wanted to [[Spam|promote]] how much he [[Incest|loved his brother]], hence him moving all pages to HAGGER??????????? and [[Dickgirl|HERMY]]??????????? for the [[lulz]]. Although he was relatively [[unfunny]] at that point, his editing style shows a clear pattern towards the fact that he is probably either an [[EDiot]], a [[btard|/b/tard]], or both (latest [[tabloid|news]] has confirmed that he is, in actual fact, both). He also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Cadderly_Bonaduce reverts] [[Cocksucking|legitimate edits]] as vandalism.

He has succeeded in getting many pages [[Criteria for speedy deletion|protected due to repeated recreation of deleted material]] and has even had the high honor of being [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Titleblacklist recognized in the MediaWiki] title black person list. So much for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:DENY “denying recognition”!] His vandalism is permanently visible in the logs, for example such as here when they were pwnt epically with [[goatse]] and [[LOL WUT]], often with the help of a bot, to cause the [[Firefox|browsers of Wikipedia sysops]] to crash, creating an [[epic win]] against them. His vandalism logs are often used to make statements about culture, [[politics]] or society, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Bony_devil here], in the names of the pages he moves them to. He also always tells users to visit the [[GNAA]] website which crashes your [[computer]].

==Past life==
:''Main article: [[JarlaxleArtemis]]''
In [[2006|a past life]], Grawp (real name [[Jeremy David Hanson]]) was the Wikipedo [[Wikipedia:User:JarlaxleArtemis|JarlaxleArtemis]], a user who was frequently banned because he [[Aspie|couldn’t play well with others]] and picked fights with [[Linuxbeak]]. As a result of his antics, he was a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/JarlaxleArtemis repeat] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/JarlaxleArtemis_2 visitor] to Wikipedia’s [[ArbCom|e-Court]]. Jarlaxle also despised the TOW administration and had no problem making his feelings clear to them.

To achieve his aims, he did [[vandalism]]. [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|Mission Accomplished]]. 

Well, not really. He got [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Long-term_abuse/JarlaxleArtemis this page] made about him that outted his first middle and last name, birthdate, school, and more information than even [[Daniel Brandt]] could uncover. He kept trying to blank the page to no avail. Eventually, the page became a talking point on [[Wikipedia Review]] for why Wikipedia administrators deserve outting, so [[Krimpet]] deleted it. (Krimpet would later restore and delete it again in a fit of [[bipolar]] pique.) Finally, in a fit of [[Lulz|benevolence]], the offending [[dox]] were [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=Alison&page=User%3AJarlaxleArtemis%2FArchive+I baleeted] by arch-nemesis [[Alison]]. He then left [[TOW]] only to return bigger, badder, and better as Grawp. [[Some argue]] that his vandalism rampage is a cover for the having one of the [http://gaygamer.net/2007/01/top_10_gayest_tabletop_charact_1.html Top 10 Gayest Tabletop Characters] as his username.

==[[Unwarranted Self Importance]]==
[[Image:Grawpdemotivator.jpg|thumb|left|He takes his mission to a crazy extent, but he’s going it alone.]]
[[Image:Hagrid.jpg|thumb|left|[[hagger|Grawp's brother]] doing an impression of the [[HA! HA! Guy]].]]
[[Image:Grawp.PNG|thumb|Grawp attempts to pwn [[Sweet Eva]]’s ED page. This will always be a [[fail]]ure, because despite his [[win|efforts]] at Wikipedia, ED will [[unrealistic expectations|nail this cunt to the ground]] because ED does not tolerate that [[shit]] like Wikipedia does.]]
[[Image:Lol wut avocado.jpg|thumb|When pwning Wikipedia with Goatse and LOL WUT, a [[retard]]ed Wikipedia sysop on the administrators’ noticeboard thought that the LOL WUT image featured an ''avocado'' instead of a ''pear.'' Also, there’s ''eleven'' consecutive posts, not twelve, due to TOW’s two-hundred-megabyte-per-page limit.]]
[[Image:GOTHAGGER.jpg|thumb|Identified again.]]
Grawp has a tendency to let things like this ED page get to his head.  He has sought to spread his name by using his HAGGER??? [http://www.partyvan.info/index.php/Special:Contributions/Grawp move vandalism] on the [[partyvan.info|Insurgent W/i/ki]], and spams links to this ED article on the various /b/s out there.  The mods only smile and delete all posts, as his powers stop at the border of Wikimedia and Futaba.  If anything his imageboard spam, coupled with his attacks of anon wikis, makes him look pathetic despite his [[win]] on Wikipedia.  However, it should be noted that [[User:Kakama5|Kakama5]] is also rather [[butt-hurt]] about his pathetic little wiki being [[ræped]] to such a great extent.

In particular, Grawp needs to realize when spamming /b/ that [[Anonymous]] is not his [[personal army]], and repeatedly asking /b/tards to vandalize Wikipedia is a form of [[cancer]]. Yet in spite of /b/ not being his personal army, it sure does act like one. This was proven at a TOW [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Grawp CheckUser case] in which Grawp was found to have spammed the shit out of 4chan and possibly other chans with requests like “Please go to http://wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=B&action=edit&oldid=204349478 (b0rked link, do not click) and click ‘’Save page.’ ” In this, Grawp is actually a successful [[troll]] because he gets masses of mindless anons to replace the featured article with HAGGER? and also causes massive butthurt to Wikipedia admins who really cannot cope with the epicness of Grawp. This is because contrary to [[some argue|common belief]], Anonymous are just [[sheep]] who are part of a cult that is just as dangerous as the [[Co$]] and will do whatever someone who is smarter than they are tells them to (well, the newfags at least—the old anonymous is a [[Internet tough guy|tougher nut to crack]]). It is under debate as to whether the lulz generated by the cancer is [[lie|beneficial]] in the [[dick|long]] run.

He also lol’d when [[Jack Merridew]] was pwnt for abusive [[cockpuppet]]ry, and hates the [[IP address|checkuser]]fag [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Thatcher Thatcher] with a vengeance, because he automatically blocks Grawp socks. You can help by creating as many accounts as possible then donating them to Grawp, like the [[feels good man|dream life]] of a serial [[Fapping|masturbator]] making [[money]] by donating his [[semen]] to [[lesbian]]s who want to get pregnant, which [[Epic win|both spreads his genes and he doesn’t have to take responsibility for the consequences]].

Grawp is living proof that when [[Jimbo]] said that allowing anyone to edit as one of the core principles of Wikipedia, it won’t work like Jimbo said it would. Jimbo made the [[anal]]ogy of sitting near strangers in a restaurant. Yes, they can kill you with that [[rump|steak]] knife if they want to, but that doesn’t stop people going out to restaurants, does it, so why should it stop a [[exploitable|freely editable website]] being successful? The reason is people like Grawp. People behave [[OTI]] differently than they would in real life, hiding behind their [[anonymous pussy|anonymity]]. However, recent research has suggested that the evidence points to Grawp being a genuine Mmbabies in real life, who would stab you with that steak knife given half a chance whilst screaming a battle cry of “HAGGER???????????????????.” Therefore Wikipedia is actually doing the wider world a favor by keeping this black person [[furry|animal]] sitting in a chair harassing people OTI than going out and committing IRL vandalism, or [[murder]].

==Motivation==
[[Image:Urban Rose.jpg|thumb|right|[[Urban Rose|This chick]] was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=205343638 concerned] about Grawp, and contemplated getting his ISP to cut off access for abuse. Grawp reacted to this by telling her “[[I'd hit it|I jacked off to the photograph of you that used to be on your user page!]]” See her page for moar delicious drama.]]
[[Image:Grawpani.jpg|thumb|right|Moar lulz at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AN/I administrators’ noticeboard]. Reality check: it’s cocksucking pieces of shit (i.e. everyone who contributes to Wikipedia) who are the sheep, not Grawp.]]

[[Image:Anothergrawpvandal.jpg|thumb|right|Grawp has recently taken to replacing popular pictures used in Wikipedia articles with [[Nikki Catsouras|shock images]], in combination with his [[GNAA]] tactics, personal [[attack]]s, page move [[vandalism]] and attempts to crash administrators and vandal-fighters’ [[Firefox|browser]] windows. All things considered, Grawp is a vandalism juggernaut who can be most aptly compared with the [[Hitler|Axis Powers]] in [[Europe]] circa 1941.]]

It is true however, as we all noticed, that it’s not just Wikipedia that Grawp has a problem with. He seems indeed to be a [[batshit crazy|misanthrope]], who will use maximum force to destroy and corrupt as much as he can on any [[wiki]] he can find. An example of this is the obscure wiki [http://corpknowpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page CorpKnowPedia], which long ago died a [[dissected-chan|painful death]] due to [[spam]]bots, eating up its remains like [[Slipknot|maggots]] [[NOM NOM NOM|feasting]] on a rotting corpse. Despite this, Grawp is like the [[bird|vulture]] who is [[Man points|man]] enough to [[a challenger appears|challenge]] the little [[faggots|maggots]] at their own game, and thus CorpKnowPedia’s festering remains have been [http://corpknowpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/Grawp pwnt with HAGGER????????????] everywhere and even the spammers are wary about touching it now, because HAGGER????????????? damages the reputation of the [[bullshit]] they are spamming. CorpKnowPedia is also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/CorpKnowPedia famous] for having an [[AFD]] debate about it, whereas it’s one of at least 9,000 articles that quite easily met the [[criteria for speedy deletion]] yet got debates, anyway.

Grawp's determination to infuse the staid, [[boring]] realm of Wikipedia with delicious entropy has generated a considerable amount of rage among its admins. There’s a likelihood that the faggots at Wikipedia are going to make a serious attempt at contacting Grawp’s ISP for [[Lulz|long term abuse]], as set out in this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Abuse_reports/Grawp_IPs manifesto]. However, it is believed that Grawp is too [[hardcore]] for such elementary tactics and will continue to provide lulz for a long time to come on Wikipedia. It is also believed that Urban Rose has reacted to this ED page by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Urban_Rose&diff=205814138&oldid=205160429 removing] personal information and a photograph of her, which will remain on ED longer than [[Fred Phelps]]’ idea of how long Heath Ledger’s stay in [[Hell]] will be.

It is also known, however, that there is another vandal of not nearly the same stature—[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Headstrust Headstrust] (in actuality, an account created by Grawp before he was known as “Grawp,” as he has been editing Wikipedia since January of 2005). He, along with [[Molag Bal]], has been showing behavior that imitates that of Grawp recently, to the extent that the wikifags [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ronin_of_Chaos can’t even determine] whether it’s the real Grawp, or just a [[Saddam Hussein|body double]]. However, the real Grawp is [[Pretty cool guy|cool]] with Encyclopædia Dramatica (and is a regular contributor to this page) and any vandal spamming ED with Grawp-style vandalism is [[Some argue|most likely]] not the real Grawp.

Another serious issue raised came about when Grawp, like [[Daniel Brandt]], has said that Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Criticism_of_Wikipedia&diff=prev&oldid=170833633 is being used for spying]. The [http://www.lkozma.net/wpv/index.html website] shows a map of the world, and records IP edits that take place and shows the location they are taking place in. Although Wikipedia may seem a welcoming place full of [[Wikigroaning|familiar pop culture subjects]], do not be deceived - edits there leave a trail that someone can follow to come back and hurt you using. Wikipedia is simply not a safe place to edit, unlike [[Encyclopædia Dramatica]].

Grawp’s method of spamming [[4chan]] also highlights a vulnerability—both of Wikipedia itself, a useless mass of [[shit]] masquerading as something of value, and that of the supposedly anonymous editors themselves. For example, when anons are told to vandalize a page with “HAGGER???????” some of them actually [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I%27m_into_Something_Good&action=history do it], and not only that, they [[DOING IT WRONG|do it wrong]], as in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/88.107.83.9 here]. This user’s [http://samspade.org/whois/88.107.83.9 WHOIS] information, revealed to absolutely any internet user by Wikipedia, gives anyone the ability to contact that anon editor’s [[Net neutrality|ISP]], which is just one reason why we should go down with the tyranny of Wikipedia [[nao]]. The other is that [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=17175 Wikipedia is a dangerous cult] that is on a par with [[Scientology]] for those who become involved with it, and Grawp is a [[Terrorist|freedom fighter]] against the playboy, womanizing encyclopedist Jimbo’s goal of world domination, funded by his [[slave]]s, much as with Scientology - donating to Wikipedia is more than paying “[[Cash|tithes]]” to a church; Wikipedia is a more powerful [[religion]] than [[Christianity]] that Grawp is fighting against.

Also, Wikipedia anti-vandalism [[tool]]s all have [[gay]] names, like “[[Hugbox|Huggle]]” and “[[Twink]]le,” so when the slaves to Wikipedia install these programs they are being [[BDSM|humiliated]] by their servitude AND by calling them gay names. Grawp assaults this faggotry like a hot knife cutting through butter.

From the Grawp-hating Wikipeon (now converted to the dark side of [[trolling]]) Urban Rose:

==Grawp’s Legacy==
[[Image:Grawp lol pokemon.jpg|thumb|Grawp would be a [[Awesome|formidable]] [[Pokemon]]. Unfortunately, he’s not one.]]
A number of changes have been made to Wikipedia because of Grawp. Like [[Willy on Wheels]] single-handedly caused Wikipedia developers to create a feature called “autoconfirmation”—where an account has to be at least four days old to move articles, edit semi-protected pages, upload an image over another image with the same name, mark new articles as “patrolled,” etc.—Grawp has also inspired changes in MediaWiki technology. Due to Grawp’s rampant page-moving vandalism, Wikipedia now has a “[[Wikipedia:MediaWiki:Titleblacklist|title blacklist]],” and auto-confirmation for an account has been increased so that accounts still have to be at least four days old, but they now need at least ten edits.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28technical%29&oldid=214235417#Autoconfirm_now_requires_10_edits. ],[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Autoconfirmed_Proposal/Poll ] Also, there is now an “action throttled” feature where non-admins can only move eight pages (not counting the attached talk pages) at a time. After moving eight pages, they have to wait about thirty seconds to move more. The throttle also applies to IP addresses and non-autoconfirmed accounts if they try to make more than eight edits in a quick succession.

Furthermore, all of the chaos and havoc caused by Grawp during his page-moving sprees has resulted in some rather [[lulz]]y [[drama]], as can be seen in the [[faggotry]] and [[whining]] <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive141#Titleblacklist_whitespace_issue here]</span> and <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive141#My_bad_:.28 here (click on “Show” to the right of “Threads about errors”)]</span>, when the admins tried to stop Grawp (and failed miserably, of course) by editing the title blacklist page and ended up accidentally preventing all [[Worthless|non-admins]] from creating any page anywhere on Wikipedia that had a space in the title (which included all user talk pages); this has happened at least three times so far. Because the only requirement for becoming an administrator on [[TOW]] is the ability to suck the [[Wikipedia Cabal|Cabal]]’s [[cock]]s, it comes as no surprise that incompetent [[shit]] like this occurs in the first place.

Grawp, with the help of some rather dimwitted TOW admins, has also managed to considerably slow down—and sometimes even freeze—the entire English Wikipedia database a few times, resulting in nobody being able to edit or make any changes to Wikipedia ([[King Jimbo]] is also partly to blame, as he spends most of the money Wikipedia makes from donations on <span class="plainlinks">[http://valleywag.com/362564/transcripts-of-wikipedia-founders-sex-chats private jets]</span> and [[Rachel Marsden|hookers]] instead of Wikipedia’s servers). This occurs when a page with several thousand revisions is deleted and/or undeleted in response to Grawp’s vandalism purposefully ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Palpatine ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Harvard_University ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=NASA ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Heath_Ledger ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Mara_Salvatrucha ],  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Censorship ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Personal_computer ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Swimming_pool ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Burrito ] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Flowers_for_Algernon ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Wikipedia:Notability_(fiction) ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Tor_(anonymity_network) ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Gimli_(Middle-earth) ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Streisand_effect ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Intentionally_blank_page ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=CP-violation ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Marina_Orlova ]) or by mistake ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Lost_(TV_series) ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Genghis_Khan ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Also,%20Bilbo%20Baggins’%20uncle%20invented%20golf%20when%20he%20used%20a%20club%20to%20knock%20off%20the%20head%20of%20a%20goblin%20chieftain,%20which%20went%20down%20a%20rabbit%20hole.%20If%20only%20golf%20were%20still%20played%20that%20way… ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=South_Africa ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Nazism ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Star_Trek%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83%E2%80%83 ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=%EF%BB%BF%D2%A2AGGER%3F ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Lol;_it_only_killed_a_bunch_of_Chinks._There’s_too_many_of_them,_anyway,_due_to_overpopulation,_so_the_earthquake_did_China_a_service. ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Robert_Mugabe ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Ellen_DeGeneres ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=%EF%BB%BFGuyana ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Wikipedia%3A%CE%89%CE%91G.G%CE%95R%3F%3F ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=H%2B%2B%2BG%2B%2B%2BG%2B%2B%2BE%2B%2BR%3F ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Woodlouse ]).

Another feature has been added because of Grawp called “global blocking.”[http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steward_requests/Global&oldid=1144695#71.107.128.0.2F18.40global_request ] This feature is used to block IP addresses from editing all [[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia]] wikis except Meta, including their own talk pages. Grawp was the first person to be globally blocked; however, he can easily get around this minor obstruction by simply using [[7 Proxies|proxies]]. More upgrades in reaction to Grawp include separate expiry times for edit and move protection to pages[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=Jennifer_Connelly ] and a new option for administrators to disable the ability for a user to edit their own talk page when blocking (without having to resort to protecting the talk page).[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&oldid=241589083#Allow_this_user_to_edit_own_talk_page_while_blocked ] Also, the title blacklist now prevents redirecting pages to blacklisted titles, and replacing all the page content with a small amount of text sometimes no longer makes an automatic edit summary, as can be seen by comparing the edit summaries of these two edits: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kylu&diff=241891675&oldid=241889948 ], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kylu&diff=242120993&oldid=242044756 ] (yet some still do work [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=242131576&oldid=242131519 ]).

For one night, Grawp took over two wikis owned by Wikipedo admin [[Werdna]], who was using them to test a new feature called the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Abuse_filter|abuse filter]], which he designed primarily to stop Grawp and other page move vandals, although [[irony|ironically]] the testing ground for this feature ended up being [[raped|abused]] in itself. Due to Werdna’s extreme [[Assume good faith|naïveté]], Grawp became a bureaucrat (one step higher than an administrator) instantly upon registering an account at one of his wikis. [[All your base are belong to us|He then gave himself global sysop, steward, checkuser, and bot rights on that wiki and another wiki on which Werdna was testing his ultimate weapon against Grawp, the “abuse filter.” Grawp globally locked all accounts that were already registered on Werdna’s wikis and stripped them of their powers]], including Werdna (Andrew), [[Alison]], Kylu, and Cometstyles (Warpath). Soon, he invited other [[EDiot]]s to his new wiki and showed them how to become god-accounts like himself. Grawp and the EDiots’ reign of terror came to an end when Werdna came back online and locked the database. He then deleted the anti-religion wiki and reset the entire database of the test wiki.

It seems that Grawp has also managed to get a Wikipedo blocked by inadvertently using the same IP address as him.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Senator_Palpatine ] Lol, Wi-Fi.

{{quote|'''HAGGER!!!!!!!!!''' If Grawp, or the "1000s of socks" guy, had to make 20 good edits with each sleeper before he could activate it, we would probably see a decrease in vandalism, or at least an increase in helpful typo corrections...|[[Thatcher]] 23:15, 7 May 2008 (UTC)}}

All this means, though, is that Grawp and others will just undo twenty edits from [[Wikipedia:Special:RecentChanges|RecentChanges]], without regard to whether that is reverting vandalism or reverting [[AGF|good faith]] edits, then go on a HAGGER???????????? spree.

{{quote|Harry Potter is real. Lucius Malfoy is real and on Wikipedia, too.

Wikipedia admins are now at the stage where they’re sick of hearing about Grawp. Their method is “revert, block, ignore.” Grawp, meanwhile, seems to be running out of sockpuppets. Could this epic lulz-fest be coming to an end?

{{quote|Regarding a certain page move vandal to be remained nameless...

I brought it up in another thread that [[epic win|you are being trolled]], and Jackaranga made a similar comment in the latest thread. Your zealousness inadvertently [[NOM NOM NOM|feeds the trolls]].

Why I understand your desire to have said vandal stopped, what I and others are expressing to you is that you can't stop the single user, because it is not a single user. It was an idea brought up by someone in [[4chan]] and is copycat vandalism. IPs will span the globe and in definition. Each thread that is dedicated to the vandal gives 4chan as well as [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|the other source]] you mention for information the “[[lulz]]” they operate on. It is not hard to revert, block, ignore. Time and experience has shown this to be true. Deny recognition, because endless hunts and abuse reports will only excite them more.

Once again, thank you for your efforts. They are not in vain. But further threads and revelations of socks, sleepers, and IPs are actually what these users game you with. Seriously, it is fun for them. I know it is hard to turn the other cheek, but you should.|Keegan 07:05, 26 April 2008 (UTC)}}

{{quote|That is why I honeypot my talk page - the IPs participating in the type of [[shit]] I got yesterday find it an [[delicious cake|irresistible target]], which allows me to shut them down for three months apiece, removing another attack route. And when I do block, I almost never retort with a snide comment - I usually block without fanfare and apply the Anonblock template with same. I have brought it up before at WP:AN, and I will say it now: [[BAWWWWW|SHUT UP AND STOP FORUM-SHOPPING TO GET HIM/THEM SANCTIONED]].|Jéské (v^_^v Karistaa Usko) 08:11, 26 April 2008 (UTC)}}

{{quote|So how in the future should I respond to having come across lists of socks that need to be blocked? Would it be better if I contact an [[anti-lulz|admin via email]] than creating a thread?|Urban Rose 13:11, 26 April 2008 (UTC)}}

{{quote|That would probably be [[the best]] route, particulary try to contact one that has knowlege of the situation and/or IPs. You really have done a good job in [[cocksucking|taking on]] the [[Big dick|monster]], but there is only so much that can be done. Happy editing to you.|Keegan 15:54, 26 April 2008 (UTC)}}

Whilst the [[butthurt]] Wikifags cannot do anything about the revision-edit vandalism from 4chan, they are starting to close in on Grawp’s page move vandalism on the English Wikipedia…but hey, that’s a point…have [[Shit nobody cares about|non-English Wikipedias and other Wikimedia projects]] had [[Pwnt|their own taste of HAGGER?????]] yet? [[Wikia]]? We shall see.…

(Actually, [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Grawp other] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/GrawpSock Wikimedia] [http://incubator.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Grawp projects] have felt Grawp’s wrath already, as have [http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Grawp Uncyclopedia], and [http://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Speciale:Registri&type=block&page=Utente:Grawp Non-English language Wikipedias]. A good place for Grawp to hang out would be [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects “Proposals for closing projects”] page at the Wikimedia Meta-Wiki, in which the [[Moldova]]n [[Wiktionary]], which was made by [[butthurt]] Moldovan nationalists who can’t accept that their language is the same as [[Romanian]], could be epically pwnt with cries of “HAGGER????????.”)

The anti-lulz could also be reversed by [[you]], reading this page, imitating Grawp. You could create an account, wait seven days and make twenty small edits to articles (the required limit for page moves), then launch an assault on them with multiple Firefox windows open and the pages to be moved to at the ready. Note the title blacklist and “HAGGER” as it stands cannot be used, although Character Map can be used to get lookalike characters to allow HAGGER to slip through. However, Grawp also is known for [[Art|inventive]] titles that he moves them to, so a degree of creativity is required to result in a [[Hawt|beautiful]] page move vandalism log—imitating Grawp truly is an art form.

Wikipedians believe that Grawp’s [[Unrealistic expectations|reign as the king of page move vandalism has finally ended]] after he was [[Wikipedia:WP:DENY|denied]] by Wikipedia and all his [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Grawp|socks and categories were deleted.]] The [[Fail|results]] of this are yet to be seen, although [[some argue]] that sticking your head in the sand is not a viable defensive strategy. However, as the admins devote more time to fixing the exploits in [[MediaWiki]] that Grawp uses than actually contributing content, Wikipedia has effectively been trolled for life.
