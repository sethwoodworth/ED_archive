2002
Year of the Black Horse.  Lots of [[lulz]] this year being as it's even.  Even years are always more interesting then odd ones.  Don't let [[2001]] fool you, [[9/11|nothing interesting]] happened that year.

* We all [[Apple switch ads|/switched]] to eating apples, because [[Ellen Feiss]] said so
* Processors jump a whopping 133mhz between January 2002 & December 2002
* We all sat around the [[internets]] and got interactive a Danga (not to be confused with dingle_berry)
* Still 2 years before [[ED]] was created.
* [[Shit noone cares about|Virtual dress up dolls]] became the new [[Loli]] craze.
