Southern Decadence

According to [[conservative]] journalist J. Grant Swank, Jr. (which sounds like one of the [[gay]]est names of all time, by the way), Southern Decadence is "a yearly hoopla celebrating practicing homosexuality as a legitimate, giddy lifestyle" set in [[New Orleans]].  Mr. Swank goes on to describe the event in florid, frightening detail: "Thousands upon thousands were going to crawl all over [[New Orleans]] 'to celebrate their sexuality'."  These depraved [[faggots]] would then go on to "re-enact [[Bible|Sodom and Gomorrah]] in broad daylight -- and into the night haunts, as well".

But, according to J. Grant, "Then came along [[Katrina]]."  He goes on to describe the anguished [[oh noes]] of all the soggy [[homo]]s in gleeful detail: "Now [[New Orleans]] is under water, bathing in sewage and devastation rather than providing downtown fountains for homosexual capers aplenty."

Homosexual capers aplenty.  Sounds like this guy knows what he's talking about.  If you care to read the rest of the article, it is here.  [http://www.michnews.com/artman/publish/article_9292.shtml]
