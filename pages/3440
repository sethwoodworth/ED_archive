It all started when a [[Something Awful]] [[goon]] named '''Dr. [[Quinn]]''' first spotted '''George Alexander Yarid''' on public access:
      
:''There's a public/cable access host here in Richmond, VA who calls himself Gorgeous George. He's a big fat son of a bitch with greasy hair, ill-fitting clothes and a heavy dose of self-delusion. And he also looks like L. Ron Hubbard amirite? He's sort of a local celebrity - just about everyone I know has had some sort of real-life encounter with him. He's been hosting his little call-in show for about the past 10 years, I think, although my friends and I only discovered it maybe 3-4 years ago. Anyway, needless to say, we had no choice but to prank-call him relentlessly. Unfortunately, he was only on maybe 12 weeks per year.. but we made those weeks count. During any given episode, we had at least half a dozen cellphones dialing in, the end result being that literally about 90% of the calls he received were us insulting him.''

[[Image:George-joey.jpg|thumb|Gorgeous George: Lookalike to one of America's greatest heroes.]]
George Alexander Yarid, aka Gorgeous George (born July 16, 1968), is 42 and still lives in a tri-level house with his mother. It is a decent house in a decent neighborhood, but it's not the mansion George likes to say it is on TV. Alimony money pays for it and his mom must be pretty tolerant to let her [[basement dweller|retard son]] still live with her after 42 years. Gorgeous George used to deliver food for a living. Now he <s>sells coupons</s> hosts karaoke nights on occasion. Fun facts about GG:

{{quote|Woooooo!|Gorgeous George}}
{{quote|I am Wooooooooooooo, THE BABYMAKER|Gorgeous George}}

[[Image:Morbidly Obese.jpg|thumb|One of the many truthful calls George has received]]
*Although he rants against fat chicks, they seem to be the only type of girls who will show up on his show. 
*He often claims that his show is getting picked up by UPN. Not surprisingly, though, he's still on public access.
*He often wears a t-shirt with his own picture on it.
*He thinks he's God's gift to women. He also thinks he's an [http://home.comcast.net/~qcebt/gg_skits.wmv absolutely hilarious sketch-comedian].
*A female Richmonder put up a personals ad on a local phone-based dating service. After a couple days, she received a cocky but friendly message in her inbox from George. The next day, another. A couple days after that, a less friendly, more aggressive message. And it went on and on for two weeks, each message getting more and more angry. "You're lucky I would even lower myself to talk to you, you stupid bitch!" and so on.
*He is, in fact, not particularly gorgeous.
*He is thought to be <s>a bisexual</s> gay.
*He refuses to admit he's a greasy cunt wad.
*He constantly trips on his own fat gut.
*In [[British|cockney rhyming slang]], any person who exhibits these traits is referred to as a "cheddar" (Cheddar Gorge; Gorgeous George).
*His constant hooting and repetition of verbal diarrhea in the form of swear words and predictable insults is most likely the result of Tourette's Syndrome and/or inbreeding.
*He has spoken about the Church of [[Scientology|Sollentolgy]] and [[cult|Jehovennis Witness]].
*He fucked Rick Darius on a pool table and broke it.

Update – GG Sux fever has spread worldwide and is on every video sharing site through out the world. Recently his videos were uploaded to tudou.com which is based in Taiwan. If you know anything about Taiwan is blatant disregard for copyright laws. There motto in English roughly translates in to “Censorship in any practa… in any, any, any verbiage, in any proximity of the word is is a blatant crime.” Which is where GG got his expression from.

==Gorgeous George Show==
{{quote|Sollentology|Gorgeous George}}{{quote|Jehovennis Witness|Gorgeous George}}
[[Image:g_george.jpg|thumb|When in Gorgeous George country, it is well advised to keep on your toes (note that this is a wax mannequin of [[Jodie Foster]]).]] 
[[Image:Georgealicious.jpg|thumb| This totally describes George's looks.]] [[Image:Gorgeous_george_hooker_2_5.jpg‎|thumb|George with one of the many hookers with STD's he has brought on his show. Notice the picture captures him for the fat pig he is.]]
The Gorgeous George Show is the television equivalent of [[AIDS]]. The show itself is about as comedic as watching your parents die of [[cancer]], and then engaging in unprotected penetrative sex with a putrid dead porcupine with a maggot festering case of hemorrhoids (but at least that would smell better). George and his retarded lap dog, Kevin, both have severe speech impediments. The production values make the average Christmas morning home movie look like Werner Herzog by comparison. The jokes themselves are only funny if you've never been allowed to leave your house in your whole life, and have therefore never been introduced the concept of humour until just seconds prior to seeing it, and the likely result of that would be for you to immediately develop a phobia of anything calling itself comedy or humour for the rest of your sad life. In many respects, the show provides an archetypal example of why cable access television is a gigantic failure, while simultaneously contributing the sole reason to preserve it. In any given episode, you can expect to be treated to any one or more of the following EnGorgeous George trademarks:
*GG yelping like he's being penetrated in the ass with [[South Africa|cactus skin condoms]].
*His retarded sidekick, Dogfucker Jones, who looks like Squeak from the Academy Award winning film, Baseketball. Apparently he's not allowed to speak much. Doing so causes small children in Africa to catch [[AIDS|Syphillis]].
*Some random [[black]] guy who looks ashamed to be in the studio.
*Some random Asian martial arts instructor who immediately gives up martial arts for life after a Karate demonstration by George, also leaving said Asian with life long night terrors.
*Fat chicks miming Britney Spears. This has negative sexual arousal value (DErections).
*Random female guests (almost exclusively drug addicts or prostitutes or both) who's only purpose is to sit and laugh nervously at GG's jokes while he stares at their breasts.
*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjerrmYbBM| The crappy introduction to his show.]
*"Gorgeous George's Donkey Penetration Extravaganza".
*GG attempting to do karate and collapsing under his own fat.
*GG being [[fat]]. 
*A [[semen|strange white discharge]] lodged in his hair.
*GG drinking his own urine and [[oral_sex|fellating]] a whole circus, while assorted 10 year old boys rub his fat ass down in Crisco.
*GG knowing that 99.9% of his calls are insults and yet [[retarded|he still takes calls]].
*George beating [[Kaye Lazar]] for talking.
*You know what? Fuck this. Gorgeous George is just a fucking mess. Abandon hope, all ye who enter in. When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares also into you. Watching a segment that does not feature him being insulted via phone repeatedly, has no point. You will just come away feeling like you've been hit by a mac truck of pure fucking idiocy (or a pasty moist object of equivalent weight). I remember sitting down to watch it one night; I was left with this feeling I shall never describe. It's worse than disappointment. It is the feeling of your soul slipping away through your hands. Gorgeous George is that stray dog at the pound. You know which one. That [[13 year old boy|13 year old]] mangy cobbled together mutt found chained to a post on I-80. Instead of being lovable and friendly though, it's meaner than piss and just sits there all day and pisses and shits itself. For the love of Jesus Fucking Christ on a Stick, I hope nothing good comes of this guy, ever, or that his sphere of influence ever expands outside of a crowd capable of grasping irony. 
*Every episode ends with a montage of GG taking an 18 inch dildo from multiple angles. This montage goes on for 25 minutes (metaphorically speaking).

==Sue==
[[Image:Fontaine2.jpg|thumb|GG and his lovely bitch Sue. Notice Sue's [[beastiality|fearful look]]. What a pimp!]][[Image:Georgeandsue1.jpg|thumb|the day before Sue hocked her ring for crystal meth]]
[[File:GGHASPOSSE.png|thumb|Studly]]
[[File:clean your goddamn house.jpg|thumb|this is what he calls home]]
[[File:His_house.png|thumb|His mansion]]
For two years, Gorgeous George made repeated reference to his [[stripper|girl]] Sue, who lived in Las Vegas. Many joked that he had created a fantasy relationship with a [[stripper]]. In his season finale for 2005 (after returning from a two week absence), he delivered a 45 minute monologue, detailing his trip to [[Vegas]] to bail Sue out of jail for a crystal [[meth]] addiction. Therein it was revealed that Sue was, in fact, a stripper (and purportedly still is).
In Vegas, George proposed to Sue; she accepted his gift of a ring and necklace, hocked them, and fled the scene.  She's currently married to "some biker bozo."

Meanwhile, George still hasn't taken that [http://www.gorgeousgeorgeshow.net/sue.html shitty poem] about her off his website.  [[butthurt|Pussy whipped much?]]

==The Prank Calls==
As time went on and the prank calls continued they became a Richmond pastime. As more people jumped on the GG insult train it gained critical velocity and turned into an unstoppable lolz-train bound for dramatic trainwreck. There were [http://alluvion.org/stats.php?info_hash=e845b0df6195973b3e8f7969c7cd0c04ba22cb4f several GG prank call clips] released to record the lolz for those who do not have Richmond public access. These clips became immensely popular on the SA forums.

According to George's website, "These so-called internet geeks obviously have too much time on their hands. Most of them are college drop-outs or science fiction nerd computer game Star Wars goons who are all sons of bitches!!!"

Somehow Gorgeous George found out that his show was being distributed on the [[Internet]] without his consent. This led to him going on an [http://home.comcast.net/~qcebt/gg_internet.wmv insane rant] on his show about how he was going to [[sue]] everyone involved for [[copyright]] infringement, [[RIAA]] style. Thankfully GG never figured out how to make a [[DMCA]] request!

During this episode George stopped taking phone calls, but in the next episode he states that the public access administrators (who hate the fat fucker just as much as we do) told him that he had to take calls, and the pranks immediately resumed.

Here are some examples of the memorable calls people have made:
*Fatass
*Dickhead
*Douchebag
*[toilet flush]
*Hey George, I've got a relationship question for ya. My girlfriend a couple weeks ago, she started playing hard to get. And recently she just stopped responding to any of my calls. And I was wondering, did you eat her?
*MORBIDLY OBESE!
*You live with your mom
*Hey, take a bath you fat pig!
*I just wanted to say happy birthday to ya, and I also wanted to say that you're very fat
*Im gonna miss your bloated ass (he was going off the air for 2 weeks)

*Walrus Fucker
*Fuck you George
*Hey,why are you so fat?
*Stop stealing jackets from Century 21 agents you.
*Hey George, pick me up some spaghetti.
*You stink like shit.
*I would have stopped by to say 'Hi,' but you were stuffing your fat face.
*Eat my dick.
*Do you think that he ([[George W. Bush|George W. Bush]]) should drink his own urine like you?
*Fatso..uh fat.
*[[Barack_Obama|Obama]] is a [[socialism|socialist]] , and you are a fat.
*It's a situation where the (Dallas) Cowboys could get hurt here like you could get a disease from the crack whore.
*Hey George, did you get lucky with that prostitute last week?
*I'd also like to say that you have a fatass.
*Somebody nutted in your hair.
*Hey George, fuck you--
*Hey man I was just wondering. I had a couple of questions. I was trying to take count, and I lost count. how many chins do you have?
*I've been a big fan of you for years and I absolutly loved you on Hoarders.
*CLEAN YOUR HOUSE FAGGOT!
*Sorry i don`t speak G.A.Y
*Fat Virgin
*Hello..you're fat.
*Hey, how ya doin'...ya stupid fuckers?
*Homosexual.
*Hi, you're a complete douche. (Kaye Lazar's Cavalcade of Fun)
*Hey, where's that big fag. (Kaye Lazar's Cavalcade of Fun)
*You're a fuckin'--
*I wanted to ask you about the stripe in your hair....um, it looks pretty stupid.
*That girl was right.
*We prank call your home.
*We prank call your cell phone...you should answer more.
*I myself am overweight, you are overweight, together we can lose weight.
*I'm thankful that I banged Sue and gave her a ring for--
*Hey George, it's GGYanksHisSausage, you're still a fat fuck. I'd like to wish George a Merry Christmas.

==The Zopilote Era==
When zopilote moved to Richmond, the first thing that popped into his head was to go fuck with Gorgeous George. He took one of his friends with him and visited the studio after GG's show, making his best attempt to make friends with Gorgeous George. He pulls a promise out of Gorgeous George to let him be a guest on the next show. Project Georgehem had begun.

A massive effort began on livejournal, some Richmond forums, and on the VCU campus to organize a mob to flood the public access studio during GG's next show. On the day of GG's next performance, several phone-calls were made by interested parties to ensure that GG would actually be on that night. All responses were positive: Gorgeous George's show would go on. Shortly before the show, the crowd gathered outside Richmond's Siegel Center. A cursory headcount revealed a figure around 50 people. 

Upon reaching the TV station, zopilote banged on the door and waited for a representative of rva public access to speak to. No answer. He tried several times. Still nothing. It didn't take long for the mob that followed him to begin assisting, banging on all the doors and windows and screaming a frequent taunt such as "COME ON OUT AND FACE US, YOU FAT FAGGOT!" However, inside the studio Gorgeous George was not there to answer their demands. His show had been spontaneously canceled to make way for an interview with the man running as a [[President]]ial candidate for the [[Libertarian]] Party, Michael Badnarik. Given the circumstances, the staff of the public access TV studio came to the only logical conclusion: that a rogue pro-establishment [[terrorist]] group had come to [[assassinate]] the Libertarian candidate. They called the [[police]], and within minutes there were more flashing lights outside the TV studio than there are at a [[rave]]. Faced with armed and angry law enforcement agents, the crowd dispersed.

==George Strikes Back==
On 30 June 2005, just two days after this article first went live, George sent [[Weev]] the following '''highly erotic''' [[e-mail]] (Note: emails are [[sic]]):

<blockquote>That disturbing picture that you sent through e-mail was viewed by others. (SUCH AS AN HENRICO INVESTIGATOR).
 Keep the shit up and you will end up in cell with worthless faggots like yourself showing you which way is up. 
 All your other loser friends at VCU can rot in hell . If there are any more disturbing pictures that are sent 
 through my e-mail, there will be problem on your hands. You do not know who your fucking with. Your the new
 poster child to carry the torch for those losers from the joke of a show Wednesday night crap explosion.
 Just know any vulgar pictures , such of what you sent this past Monday, is consider a felony. Do your fucking
 homework. Keep the shit up and we will see who gets the last laugh.</blockquote>

Within the hour, he sent another one:
<blockquote>I know that a bunch of you assholes get off on somebody else's problems. You all are a bunch of pissants that
 are miserable with yourself. Pushing my hot buttons talking about my girl Sue. Sue is doing fine and is getting
 the help she needs. I talk to her at least once a week and she and I have made peace with one another. She has
 a support group that help and she knows that I'm only phone call away.
 It is true that I had some odd jobs here and there, bartending, doing catering events and working as a D,J for
 private parties that I do. Also have my own personal business that I'm making a lot of lute and enjoy doing.
 So otherwords my plate is full. 
 It is true that I have a second house windsor farms that I recently purchased over a year ago , plus my house
 in the west end. I also buy houses , get them fixed up and then resale them. So once again I have hands in
 different projects. 
 Lastly, I have worked hard in getting my show in other markets . So I do not need bunch (sic) of compulsive 
 masturbators, such as you turdlings, needing to be concerned with my endeavours. George</blockquote>

'''Conclusion:''' (sick)

==Gorgeous George and the Denny's Debacle==
Rumor has it that sometime in the 90's, George became confrontational with a person who he supposedly overheard talking smack about him and his shitty public access show. This is what allegedly happened  
The G.A.Y. was eating there and he over heard this guy named Matt talking shit about his FAT ASS from a few booths away. Matt was with his little brother and his girlfriend. Fat G.A.Y. yarid went over and confronted Matt. G.A.Y. then said some SICK SHIT to matt's TEN year old brother and took matts keys! So matt told GG they were? gunna take it outside!

Matt was walking out the door and turned around to clock the 350 pound douche when the fat pig tried to sucker punch him! Too bad when? he did GG tripped on his FAT GUT and matt landed a haymaker and a roundhouse kick to the shit's FAT COCK SUCKING FACE! when GG tried to get up, matts HOT SEXY EROTIC girlfriend rushed outside and pulled out a can of mace from her purse and PWNED him with it! The cops came and took the fat away, George was crying the whole time. George admitted this happened on the hooker vid, he should remember it as he was the only one at Denny's over 350 lbs!

==Fat fuck strikes back, again==
In late 2008, the Gorgeous George show made a low key return to television.  Despite the valiant efforts of ED to stir up potential win, the return apparently went unnoticed.  An update on the fat man's site (<i>"To all those people looking for insults from the callers and the prank callers, look again"</i>) pretty much confirms a lulz genocide, and can only be attributed to Jew.  Hilariously, the pig is also charging money for subscription to his blog, and for DVDs of his failure of a show.  Clips from the 2008 season are available [http://www.gorgeousgeorgeshow.net|on his site], and show that [[Bullshit|his show remains a powerful message, and a shining beacon of hope amongst tumultuous times of shallow, uninspired and unfunny television]]: as well as the fact that George has lost no weight, [[Pedophile|Kevin still scares the shit out of me]], the production values of the show are still [[shit]], etc etc etc etc etc etc.  And ultimately, no-one prank called the fucker.  Epic, merciless [[phail]] has swept Richmond. In more recent news GG has been commenting on various Youtube videos such as [http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/80787612/ Gorgeous George with Hooker]. Although he threatens to take the videos down, it's been several months and nothing has happened proving that even Youtube hates Gorgeous George.

He is still around, voting down comments but he is too chicken shit to say anything. George, why didn't you show up to the bars.. it's just a fight. Now everyone knows that you're a coward, along with the huge list of other things which make you a piece of shit. Now, he has gotten the Gorgeous George with a Hooker video along with a bunch of other videos taken down. They were quickly re-uploaded making the fat fuck's victory short lived. Though apparently, the youtube staff is rubbing George's dong for him and now almost all the Gorgeous George videos have been removed.

The latest activity from The Large One, comes from a prank call made to his personal cell phone where a friendly individual tried to wish him a happy new year and being the fat raging froggy faggot that he is, GG exploded into a flurry of [[Butthurt|QQing]] with much lulz to ensue.

== Gorgeous George's Pollard Park incident==
[[File:Pollard_park.jpg‎|thumb|Scene of the crime. Whats ironic and even more funny about this, is that its down the street from a childrens hospital.]] 



Sometime in 2009, a bunch of young kids were insulting "The Large One" telling him he's not in shape or fit, but FAT! This caused GG to go Irate and GG proceeded to go on a tirade(shocker)and while he was jumping up and down in a fit of rage, GG's 2 inch dong was exposed to the the young children because his G-Unit shorts didnt properly cover his private area. The cops were called immediately, however it is unknown what happened to GG as a result of this incident. But to be on the safe side, its best that you dont allow your kids to go to Pollard Park so they dont encounter this SICK FUCK!

==Fat Fuck goes on a tirade==
Recently Mr. No-Sense-Of-Humor decided to whine and bitch to YouTube that his videos from his show are being used without his permission (In other words he pulled a DMCA card from the same pocket he keeps his twinkies in) Being the selfish Mama's boy he says "...and what I have on youtube on GG on DVD account are the ones and only ones related to Gorgeous George that are going to be on there." In the same weezing breath he also admits there is nothing he can do about people making videos with his likeness. So apparently if you want to put GG's head on a turd while he does the Cha Cha that's OK.

While watching the videos you'll notice a couple of things:
#His desk is cluttered with trash.
#He stole a bunch of trophies from Salvation Army.
#He still uses Video Tapes which makes sense because his sense of aesthetics hasn't changed since George Michael was in the closet.
#He got a dirty Sanchez from Kevin.
#He has a [[mullet|mullet]].
#He put on another 100 pounds.

Unfortunately, GG took down those videos off of Youtube but thanks to the Taiwanese you can watch GG's butthurt again in it's original glory.

===in forma pauperis=== 
On the 11th of March 2010, the case was dismissed as George not only filled out the complaint incorrectly [http://ia331227.us.archive.org/1/items/gov.uscourts.vaed.251588/gov.uscourts.vaed.251588.2.0.pdf], but also used the wrong color crayon when doing so. Also of note was that an '''in forma pauperis''' (IFP) application was accepted. An IFP is described as a ''petition filed by a poor person in order to proceed in court without having to pay court costs such as filing fees.'' [http://www.lectlaw.com/def/i020.htm]. So much for the six income figure.

== Gorgeous George 2007 Episode (GG likes to be sexually whipped)==
In this video GG displays some sexual activities(around the 7:30 mark) by having a woman whipping him and apparently gets turned on by this.
This just goes to show that GG has no problem being the bitch!  
[[File:Gg ed page.jpg|thumb|GG is also no stranger to Chippendale's]]

Note: The title of the video is "2010 Show 2 Part 2: The Gorgeous George Show", The part where GG is being whipped is from a 2007 episode.

From time to time George will actually create multiple accounts and argue with other

There is many more that are unaccounted for as well!

George now plans on suing Youtube! 
:"''Looks like YOUTUBE IS GOING TO BE﻿ SUED. JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED.''" - '''ggshowrules''' Epic LULZ will definitely ensue!

[http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=6d487524742b5d34&hl=en link to the page where George writes about being butthurt and confirms he plans on suing youtube]

Then, in a shocking turn of events GGonDVD (The fat pig's main base) was taken down completely, most likely for disgusting and VILE content of George DANCING WITH A HOOKER! 

George spouted some butthurt threats that were nothing the goons hadn't encountered from the fat before, this time it was more like a death keel, a squealing pig refusing to be put down.

July 20,2010 George made a new account 'GorgeousGeorgeonDVD' reuploading some of his old videos that had got taken down on his GGonDVD account for ToS. Before you know it this account will also get banned as well for ToS

==Gorgeous george show 1994-2010==
The following message was sent out by the tranny at sometime on youtube.

"I've currently have decided with long thought and going back in forth to retire from the Gorgeous George Show. It pains﻿ me , but it is no longer fun anymore. I might change﻿ my mind about this, but for now, there will not be a 6 week season for the show, due to personal stuff that I'm dealing with. I might change my mind in the future and restart the show, but at this time, there will not be a 2010 season."

He`s pretty much saying that he is too butt hurt to do any of his horrible shitty shows and wants to quit.Which means that the goons have defeated G.A.Y and have ended the fats streak of false copyright flagging.

G.A.Y. followed up with this message.

Photos of G.A.Y. from the 2010 season





The GAY recently stated he was retiring from his crappy show due to burnout. In all actuality, he only said that to use it as a decoy so none of the prank callers would call into his shitty show and make it worse(better). Therefore this signifies that George will always be stubborn and host his stupid show, and therefore, The Goons all over the internet should always have their phones ready to prank call the FAT! Here are videos of his 2010 season

guy is easily weighing 400lbs! FAT FUCKING-

==The G.A.Y. Life Since Pubic Access==


[[File:Gorgeous_George_Wet_Dream.jpg|thumb|What The G.A.Y. Dreams About at Night]]

GG has fallen on fat times and is looking for any kind of entertainment work. He is so desperate that he is signing up at all of these entertainment agencies on the Internet like Voice 123 which is a agency that hires voice talent (Obviously, DUH!). Read some of his “Qualifications”

[[File:Gorgeous George Voice Over Resume 1.gif|What The G.A.Y. Dreams About at Night]]
[[File:Gorgeous George Voice Over Resume 2.gif|What The G.A.Y. Dreams About at Night]]

Apparently he can do impersonations of all the current and great celebrities that all of the kiddies go gaga over these days like Howard Cosell, Ronald Reagan and Walter Cronkite. As you can see GG is up to date with all the happenings in our world.

He also says that he provides adult content which is code for he wants to do a video where he “Rubs dongs with your Daddy.”

If you want to hire GG you can go to [http://voice123.com/georgeyarid The G.A.Y. profile on voice123.com]

Recently he got cranked on his youtube. GG actually thought he was going to fly to L.A. and shoot a pilot for a show.

[[File:Fat_Football_Jersey.jpg‎|thumb|A recent sighting of the mulleted baboon:Note hes gained another 100 pounds. You can tell by his fat gut literally ripping that Dallas Cowboys Jersey.]]


Recently, some new intimate details were revealed about GG's DISGUSTING and VILE behavior towards women (As if we needed more proof). Info comes via another poor victim of GG's idiocy, a girl named Sara on Facebook who had a few run ins with the FAT. 

This proves without a shadow of a doubt that people like Gorgeous George shouldn't be allowed to exist other than in a circus freak sideshow. Aka, "The Gorgeous George Show".

==Space Mountain is banned from Richmond radio==

[[File:1 guy and a pig.jpg|thumb|The final moments before GG got banned from the radio station for his disgusting content and defamation of character on people.]]

12-21-10

Gorgeous George got over 45 complaints for his radio show and because of that he is now banned from WCLM 1450. This was mainly due to a perverted “cover” of "Chestnuts Roasting on an open fire" (He also cursed several times during the show which didn’t help either). For example, instead of singing “Merry Christmas” he sung “Merry [[Clitmas]]” (Clever, ain’t he?) then there was a part of the song where he talked about molesting women from ages 1-93. Not only is he a pervert and possible rapist but child molester as well. This all happened within the first 15 minutes of the show. 

Then for the next 30 minutes Gorgeous George got [[butthurt]] and whined and bitched about Sara. Basicaly calling her a lying whore (considering how much he loved Sue, that would still be an upgrade). He then, in a lame attempt, pretended that she called the show. The problem is the pod on her channel was so low that it was inaudible. Just like his Public Access show, he doesn't know how to control the equipment (mainly because his fingers were still sticky from eating Popeye's chicken); however, the last time he played it, the audio sounded suspiciously similar to Brenda. She has neither confirmed or denied this, then the idiot at the end of the show took calls and got pranked (what a fucking surprise). You can listen to the show here (5 parts):

Update: as of 12-30-2010 Gorgeous George criminal record. Behold the immense criminal record (I had no idea they stacked shit that high!)

The 11th one is GG's fathers criminal record, proving that his dad did indeed shoot a dog for crapping on his lawn.

==GG’s new cohort Brenda Bradshaw==

[[File:Brenda_Bradshaw_talks_about_the_shroud_of_Turin_0002e.jpg‎]]

Brenda Bradshaw is a 62-year-old washed-up has been of a psychic who has been wanting to get into GG’s pants for a long time because she can fit in them as well. She appeared on the GG Christmas radio show claiming that in 2011 some production company would pick up his show and syndicate it throughout the country (lol that’s not even in the ballpark of wishful thinking.) 

Soon after the GG show was made, a goon made a video response which was lulz. Shortly after that, the double chinned psychic made a video response of her own, which she'd promptly remove due to how butthurt she got over the comments.

Over a week's time, Brenda battled the goons by putting up videos with bad clipart, but the goons persisted and fought the psychic valiantly. As a result, she has closed her main YouTube account.

She still, however, has a vimeo account:

http://vimeo.com/user5214607

Visit her myspace page

http://www.myspace.com/555153398

Tuna caverns has opened up her stinky youtube lips with two new accounts. One dedicated to the fat fuck and the other dedicated to her lack of "skills" as a psychic.

Prophet Brenda

Gorgeous George Rules

http://www.youtube.com/user/GorgeousGeorgeRules

When you think of GG what is the first thing that you think of? According to Brenda it's Heavy Metal, '90s style head banging, hamburgers and Taco Bell...Well at least shes got the fast food part right.

<youtube>m1YKg8rXLI4</youtube>

Here is a example of how insane Brenda is. The first thing you'll notice is that her chins of fat flock together. Also, she is as bloated as Elvis' obese corpse. She's also got a really bad case of clown lip (This was probably due to the fact that Tammy Faye Baker taught her how to put on make-up).

<youtube>IAdY_bK10t0</youtube>

Believe it or not she has two GG channels with the same videos. I guess she loves stereophonic fat coming at you in all directions.

http://www.youtube.com/user/GorgeousGeorgeRuIes

Even though they are not related they both look and act alike in alot of ways. For example…
    
1. They both weigh as much as the average American 2 bedroom home.   
    
2. They both have double chins that weighs as much as a Mack truck.   
    
3. They both have that insane look in their eyes that would make Hannibal Lecter piss his pants.   
    
4.  They both think they are apex of beauty even though they are as ugly as Pat from SNL.   
    
5. They both think they are the pinnacle of talent when in reality they are as talented as William Hung (but unlike William Hung they have never had a hit record or their 15 minutes of fame)   
    
6. They both have tits that drag on the ground (likewise they both don’t wear a bra)   
    
7. They both have really big fat hairy and flabby arms.   
    
8. They both went to the Josef Goebbels school of propaganda.

9. They both wonder “What is causin’ all of this?”

UPDATE – Brenda has opened up another channel this time dedicated to the fictional “Cyber Bully Watch Network.” She got really butthurt when someone posed as her (as psychicbrenda2) to get info out of GG and now she want them to close their account voluntarily…lol

==Gorgeous George is losing his "MANSION"==
[[File:GGspigpenSold.jpg|thumb|The pig pen hits the market!!]]

Recently, the splooge haired pudgey accidently messaged a goon on youtube with some news, thinking they were PsychicBrenda1. It was about how his worthless ass doesn't in fact make a SIX INCOME FIGURE (Big surprise, right?), and is close to losing his "MANSION" that mommy gave him.

''"Hey Brenda, my [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GecEMnUVX2w video] Addressing this matter will be up by friday. I'm going to rip these a-holes a new one.

''My main concern right now is saving my home and there is nothing I can do, just about coming close on having a nervous breakdown. I have to show the mortgage company my income and I have nothing to show them, since what I make is cash in hand with driving the taxi. Though I have to turn around and pay three hundred dollars a week for rental of the cab. Which makes me averaging maybe about 300.00 dollars a week. Even though New's Years eve I made that in one night. Though I can't count on that. So there is no consistency on my income. Plus the internet advertising is a bust. It wasn't as good like what I was doing at Magazine COMPANY I was working for.''

''I need guarantee income to save my home or if not the writing is on the wall. So as bad as it is in dealing with this internet bullshit from the assholes, it is only a secondary issue. I need to concentrate on keeping my home that I've been living for 38 years of my 42 years of my life.
''If I lose that house it will devastate me. I'm desperate and I need to make a steady income and average about 1,000 a week. This is ordeal is draining me and zapping my strength. What I'm thinking about is keeping the taxi job, but get something during the day that is steady and get rid of the internet advertising gig.Making the Taxi job nights only.''

''I need a win fall of dead presidents, or altogether equaling a 1,000 dollars a week to maintain my sanity.''

''I was going to get Angela to invest in a coffee house and she has been going back in forth with me and now the guy went up on the price. Now she and I just got off the phone with a heavy argument. Throwing her nasty insults at me about me living in poverty and how I can't do it without her help. Another fucking emotional roller coaster in dealing with her bullshit.''

''So Brenda, my life is little bit more entangle with angst than you thought. Anyway, the moral of this story, I need any help you can offer with this.''

''G G"''

Maybe this will teach GG a little bit of humility. Now that he's soon to be cut from his mother's FAT, putrid, umbilical cord and has to deal with the REAL WORLD. A world where coupon sales and Takeout Taxi don't pay the mortgage. Could this be the end of the road for GG? The final nail in the coffin? Did George's entire existence finally DIE?!? I guess we just have to wait and see!
