Nullface
{{Forced Meme}}

'''Nullface''' is derived from the game [[Metal Gear Solid|Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops]]. It was created by [[Paki|Ravi Singh]] on the popular Metal Gear Solid fansite "[[Forum|TheSnakeSoup.org]]."  Nullface functions as the [[trollface]] for Metal Gear Solid fans.  The idea behind this image in the story is that Null is a kid who wants to kill the hero, Snake, but can't because Snake is such a badass.  He can't handle it because everyone told him [[unrealistic expectations|he was the perfect soldier]] when he was growing up.  He is filled with [[angst]] and [[rage]] to the point of putting his head in his hands and squinting.
