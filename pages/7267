'''''Saw''''' is what happened when two gay Aussies (one Chinese and one white) named James Wan and Leigh Whannell decided it was a good idea to make [[guro]] into a film series. The series is popular among [[13 year old boys]] for its drawn-out [[torture]] [[porn]] and gory nudity which only a [[sick fuck]] such as [[you|yourself]] could [[fap]] to. But that's all totally okay because each film ends with a pointless, [[retard|retarded]] [[shit nobody cares about|twist]] that makes it fine and dandy for people to enjoy watching other human beings having their intestines ripped out and fed to pigs. Even then, it's still better than that [[epic fail|Hostel]] [[shit]].


== Films ==

===Saw===
The only one which actually had [[shit]] to do with saws. It was apparently quite good, since it turns out that the [[old]] [[cancer]] [[cripple]] has actually been organizing massive death [[trap|traps]] from his hospital bed inbetween chemo sessions. He [[homosexual|chains two guys in a room together]], [[pwn|almost rips some bitch's mouth open]] and [[pyro|sets a guy on fire]]. Other than that, some nigger gets shot for [[trying too hard]], which is always [[lulz|lulzy]].

===Saw II: [[Electric boogaloo]]===
[[Heavy Rain|This one's about a bunch of guys in a house doing stuff so they don't die]]. There aren't even any traps this time, because all the people are completely fucking [[stupid]] and either [[fucktard|kill each other for no reason]] or get themselves shot by not listening to [[Anonymous|Jigsaw's]] [[bullshit|instructions]]. The twist is that the cocktease from the first film is now a villain, which is [[retard|stupid]] because nobody agrees to put themselves in a house full of poison and psycho [[wigger|wiggers]].

===Saw III===
Some [[fat]] guy can't get over the fact that his son was [[pwned]] by a car, so [[Sick Fuck|Jigsaw]] forces him to do a load of [[retarded|weird]] tasks which range from [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|burning]] his sons [[shit]] to shooting a lawyer in the face, which will cure him of his [[depression]]. Obviously that'll cure him. This film is notable as somebody finally has the [[balls]] to slice open Jigsaw and beat his creepy little [[the game|games]]. Ironically, Jigsaw still managed to kidnap the fat guys [[loli|daughter]] and [[shotgun mouthwash|blow off his wife's head]] from beyond the grave, so I guess fat people still [[fail]]. However, it is not all bad, as the film contains imagery of a fat guy killing people, which is always [[lulz]]. Unfortunately, this is the installment where the morons writing it decided it would be good to kill off Jigsaw, the only character in the series that actually had any elements of [[lolwut|win]].

===Saw IV===
No, of course it doesn't end when Jigsaw dies. But nobody knows how they fucked over continuity to bring him back, since nobody bothered to see it. All that's known is that the twist involves the third and fourth films happening at the same time, which [[all caps|MEANS JIGSAW IS ALIVE DURING ''SAW IV''!!!!1HOLY SHITOMG]]. But seriously, nobody cared. The fat guy from ''Saw III'' briefly reappears for about one second before he gets killed, making the previous film completely pointless. This film ''could'' have been alright, but the point stands that they repeated all the [[bullshit]] they did wrong before, and it [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG| came out ever so shittily]]. Also, [[sick fuck|Jigsaw's former fuck-buddy]] becomes the new Jigsaw.

===Saw V===
Nothing happens in this film except some guy talks to himself for two hours, and then gets crushed by a wall. That's literally it, unless you count some boring and irrelevant subplot about a fire that Jigsaw was somehow connected to.

===Saw VI===
An Jew is rejecting people from being covered probably for the [[lulz]], the [[Balloon Boy|attention]], or the fact [[Obama]] never spread the wealth like he [[bullshit|promised]]. The Jew has to walk around and kill people, only to find out it was all useless and gets [[fail|killed himself]] by some [[emo]] kid. What a wonderful idea for a movie. Also pointless, besides the series itself, is the fact that an exceedingly minor character faked her death, likely for [[lulz]], and after miraculously returning from the dead, she [[You|proceeds to be of no use for the rest of her life]] until getting gutted like a fish and dying in the middle of the movie before catching the bad guy. See: [[epic fail]]. Also Jigsaw's former fuck-buddy proves to be incompetent because he gets his ass kicked by a [[woman]]. 

===Saw VII===
Basically the same as Saw VI, except instead of a dickhead insurance guy we get a dickhead con artist. Two guys let the [[whore|woman]] they're both banging get gutted, that [[fag|dude]] from [[Linkin Park]] gets his skin ripped off, and Jigsaw's [[bitch|ex-wife]] finally gets [[pwned]]. Also, [[Inconsistent personality disorder|it turns out that one of the gay guys from the first movie was alive all along and willingly helping the guy who kidnapped him and his family]], most likely for the [[lulz]]. He "ironically" [[shit nobody cares about|traps Jigsaw's former fuck-buddy in the same room he escaped from in the first movie]]. AND IT'S ALL IN 3-D HOLY [[SHIT]].


== Characters ==
[[Image:JohnKramer.jpg]]

Although there are [[over 9,000]] characters in the franchise, none of them actually survive more than one film except Jigsaw. By default, this should mean that he's totally [[awesome]] to live while all those other bitches get killed, but everybody knows <s>old people aren't cool</s> [[Epic Beard Man|HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]. 

Everybody else is just there to get their balls ripped off on-screen, so they don't count.

== Traps ==
The whole "plot" of the movie is people getting tortured by all sorts of [[Sick Fuck|sick]] [[trap|traps]]. These "traps" (sometimes called [[The Game|games]]) usually involve people that get their [[Wat|eyes cut open]], [[WTF|lungs being castrated]] or [[LOL WUT|penises being chopped off with a hook]]. For an [[Fap|unknown reason]], most of the [[Fucktards|audience]] (see below) love watching these little games. 

These [[Bullshit|meaningless]] traps conclude [[99%]] of the movie, which obviously shows us that the writers can't think of a better storyline [[What|than a guy saving another guy from drowning in pig shit]].

== Saw: The Vidya Gaem ==
[[Image:Saw.jpg|thumb|right|[[No|Dying to play?]]]]
[[Last thursday]] it was announced that there will actually be a [[video game]] based on the series. This made all of the fanboys [[jizz]] their pants, because [[ALL CAPS|"HOLY SHIT TEH BST MOVEI EVR GON BECOME A VYDYA GAEM!12 HOW AWESOEM IS TAHT"]]. 

Unfortunately, it turned out to be more of a [[Silent Hill]] puzzle/adventure game, rather than a gorey killing-spree-fest. Most of the game includes running through a room to grab a key before you explodes yourself, going towards FREEDOM! only to be fucked over and have it be locked off with a "LOL FAG" spray painted on whatever locked it, and being chased by a [[manbearpig]] thing.

For the most part you have to '''save''' stupid bitches who are too dumb to free themselves, whilst getting yourself fucked up in the process. (ex. getting injected with poison while trying to save some chick you never met before, without having her getting electrocuted to death.) The only time you actually kill anyone is in [[fail|self defense]], since you have a key surgically put inside of you that everyone wants to get their dicks on. Oh, btw: [[spoiler]]. 

One of the only reasons people play this game is because it bleeds [[serious business|gamerscore]] for Xbox fags, like a [[furry|raccoon]] on a highway.

== Fans ==
Due to its large amounts of blood and lack of anything else, ''Saw'' has unsurprisingly become [[popular]] on the Internet. However, the last few films have caused nothing but [[IMDB]] [[butthurt]] as [[fag|fags]] cry over the slow death of the [[lie|best series ever]]. You should [[troll]] these people if you get a chance. Just mentioning how much ''Saw VI'' will suck causes endless waves of [[angst]] to [[piss|flow]].

Of course, no Saw fan has ever seen a decent gore-centric film, like Flower Of Flesh And Blood or August Underground's Mordum, but they all think they're super badass because they claim bullshit like [[Trying too hard|"dude, Saw is so fucking awesome, I love those movies so much! All that blood and gore and murder and human anguish is so fucking cool!"]] And yet if they watched Begotten, they would simultaneously puke and shit their pants. Begotten is pretty fucking boring though.

Unfortunately, [[forum|forums]] are rarely set up for the series. With nowhere to share their [[shit nobody cares about|intelligent thoughts]], this causes [[fanbois]] to upload endless amounts of boring videos of them talking for ten minutes onto [[YouTube]]. Some people also think it's a good idea to make their own versions of Saw traps which are met with critical acclaim from other [[Internet]] [[fag|fags]]. And, as with all things on the Internet, others go and ruin it further by making fucking stupid videos about SpongeBob being trapped in Jigsaw's lair. No, really.

The only "big name fan" (see also: [[douchebag]]) that has yet popped up in this [[Michael Jackson|creepy-ass]] fandom is known by the oh-so-cryptic pseudonym "that_evening". We are fairly sure she only makes graphics and writes [[fan fiction]] because she wants to do Costas Mandylor. http://community.livejournal.com/evening_dream/

'''EDIT:''' "that_evening" is no longer the only Saw fanfiction writer and is still not as obsessed as [[House of Jigsaw|teenage_roadkill.]] See also: [[Desperate]]. And although we are ''fairly sure'' that_evening only writes because she wants to do Costas Mandylor, we are certain that teenage_roadkill only writes because she wants to ride Costas Mandylor's disco stick like a coked up Lady Gaga straddling a mechanical bull during rodeo week.
