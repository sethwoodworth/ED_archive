'''█▄ █▄█ █▄ ▀█▄''' is laughter at someone else's expense (from the German concept of "[[Holocaust|Schadensfreude]]"). This makes it inherently superior to [[lolcats|lesser forms of humor]]. Just as the element of [[buttsex|surprise]] transforms the [[secks|physical act of love]] into [[rape|something beautiful]], the [[butthurt|anguish]] of a laughed-at victim transforms [[lol]] into lulz, making it longer, girthier, and [[ED:LULZ|more pleasurable]].  Lulz is engaged in by [[Brenda Williams|Internet users]] who have witnessed one major economic/environmental/political disaster too many, and who thus view a state of voluntary, gleeful sociopathy over the world's current apocalyptic state, as superior to being continually [[emo]].

Example:

You're driving on a two lane highway, listening to music and whatshit, and suddenly, you see two people go in front of you and box you in, going at a shocking 20 miles an hour on a 60 mile an hour lane, forcing everyone to get in your way.  The [[asshole]] in front of you decides to pull a prank and slams on his brakes.  You cannot react in time and [[Buttsex|rear-end]] his car.  He speeds off in his stupid [[Prius|lunchbox]] and the other guy takes an exit.  Luckily, you get the guy's license plate (U42-6MN, Tampa, FL).  You look up his information through the DMV, find his address, and launch your assault.  [[spongebob|Every waking moment of his life will become a swirling torment of pain and misery.]]  He will begin to look before opening the shower curtain, because half the time, you will be there with a knife in hand.  He will not cross the road because you will be there waiting to run him over.  He will not cook with salt because he thinks you laced it with cyanide.  His life, terrorized. For the lulz.  Win.

The term lulz was coined by [[Jameth]], and is the only good reason to do anything, from [[troll]]ing to [[rape]]. After every action taken, you must make the epilogic [[dubious disclaimer]]: "[[I did it for the lulz]]."  Sometimes you may see the word spelled as [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|luls or lolz]], but only if you are reading something written by a [[faggot]]. [[PROTIP|Pro Tip]]: If you feel particularly [[douchebag|pretentious]], or if you're talking to Frasier, use the term "epicaricacy" instead of lulz.

<pre>

agreeable occupation for the mind

A corruption of lol.
</pre>

==Etymology==

Below is a conversation said to have been held between [[Jesus]] and [[Putin]]. Whether it is apochryphal is disputed by black person

<pre>

Putin says:

lulz
man
what's the etymology of lulz
i know it's derived from lol
but how did it acquire the "u" and the "z"
WHAT BROUGHT ABOUT THIS CONCEPTUAL REVOLUTION 
IN LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 

Jesus says:

haahahah
well first off
a semantic shift had been undertaken to coalesce 'lol' from an 
abbreviation into a noun.
after the noun became established, multiple grammaticalisations 
could be carried out, such as verbing, declining and such and such
however, the 'act' of 'lolling' became too equated with stupid 
fucking faggots, so it came to be abandoned
and, by simple survival of the fittest, it is the pluralisation 
'lols' that came to prominence

Putin says:
hahaha

Jesus says:

once 'lols' became established, it underwent multiple 
vulgarisations 
such as 'lawls', 'lalz', 'lolz' etc etc
until the canonical form 'lulz' became codified by the great 
king Unbar of the Undernets*

Putin says:

HAHAHA
oh man

Jesus says:

this was done in part to subdue the last of stupid fucking faggots 
by building a wall of self-referential sarcasm
similar to the rift between the old and the new testament
whereby the christians are like 'lulz fuck jews, they're christians 
who haven't evolved yet'
but at the same time they're like 'lulz we bow before jewish prophets 
and we use jewish words like 'hallelujah''

so it is then to cover the embarassment of having grammaticalised an 
internet abbreviation as stupid fucking faggots did

Putin says:

hahaha

Jesus says:
and so it to sever all possible ties with them,
that the vulgarised form 'lulz', albeit unorthodox, has been assumed.
</pre>

<nowiki>*</nowiki>This allegedly refers to either [[Ceiling Cat]] or the proverbial [[centipede filled vagina|Éminence Grise]] of the Internet, but there is disagreement between black person, see Neumann 1977 and Smith 2002 for further discussion.

==Overview==
Beginning as a plural variant of lol, Lulz was originally an exclamation but is now often just used as a noun meaning interesting or funny internet content.

According to [[Fox News|the media]], Lulz is a corruption of [[LOL]], which stands for laugh out loud. It is part of sekrit code used by [[anonymous|evil domestic terrorists]] in their attempt to ruin innocent peoples' lives. These terrorists, known as "[[Anonymous]]" get lots of "lulz" from staging "invasions" of [[Insane|children's websites]] such as [[Habbo Hotel]].

According to Mattathias Schwartz of the ''[[New York Times]]'', Lulz is "how [[troll]]s keeps score" and is defined as "the joy of disrupting another’s emotional equilibrium". Given that lulz has been extensively covered by both FAWCKS NUUZ and the NYT, it would seem to be [[notable]]; however, it is only accorded one small section of the [[Wikipedia]] article on [[Lol]]. 

Senior Dramacrats believe lulz originally came from trolls on [[LiveJournal]], where it was then spread by [[usi|our very own website]]. The chans would pick it up later, proving the unifying ability of lulz, as detailed below.

Lulz is the one unifying force in the world. Those experiencing it are bonded mentally and emotionally. It is the [[funny|greatest experience you will ever have]]. Your first 'lulz' is akin to achieving your first orgasm, only magnified. If one is truly experiencing the lulz, they will be invulnerable to all attack. Lulz is known to show other life lessons by any means necessary, such as [[Agentmike|to not download CP, especially under the alias you use for everything else]] and to [[Peppermintpatti|not]] [[Tawneelynne|be]] [[Bravesgirl5|an]] [[attention whore]].

Using lulz in your spoken vocabulary also makes [[you]] a [[faggot]], and increases the likelihood that [[you]] will [[truth|never get laid]].

*''We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act and to find the lulz before they [[strike]].''

*''Typical result of lulz [[overdose]].''

==IRL lulz==
*fo0bar saw a California car with a LULZ license plate driving in [[Reno]].  Surrender your secrets to me!
*[[User:Amnesiac|Amnesiac]] found out that London Underground calls itself "LUL" internally. The precise amount of lulz generated by this discovery is unknown, but presumed to be [[unfunny|quite low]].

==Further developments==

===The beginning===
{{quote|Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, "Let there be lulz," and there was lulz. God saw that the lulz was good, and He separated the lulz from the unfunny. God called the lulz "'''Encyclopedia Dramatica'''," and the Unfunny he called "[[Uncyclopedia]]." And there was pr0n, and there was pedophiles — the first internets.|Genesis - The Bible}}

===Ancient version===
In ancient times they referred to lulz as lvlz as in:

 <augustus> Byzantivm was pvvnd this morning.
 <nerva> lvlz

An early scholar of lulz was the Roman poet Lucretius, who described the phenomenon [[at least one hundred years ago]]:

{{squote|It is pleasant, when the sea is high and the winds are dashing the waves abovt, to watch from the shore the strvggles of another.<br><br>LVLZ|Romans loev Schadenfreude}}

=== Modern Times===
# Ask not what your lulz can do for you, but what you can do for your lulz. - John F. Kennedy.
# We have nothing to fear, but Lulz itself - Franklin D. Roosevelt
# i did it for the lulz - Jack ruby

===Totalulz===
n. to be completely engulfed in hilarity; can also mean a completely uniform lol. Example:

 <mike> n00bs are stupid
 <dan> lol
 <bob> lol
 <alf> lol
 <mike> totalulz

===The sealclap===
Extreme totalulz can induce a '''sealclap''', an involuntary clapping motion.

In the {{audio|lulz.mp3|Good lulz}} as linked here, the [[basement dweller]] subject complements his fit of totalulz with two distinct sealclaps.

===The lulz scale===
The Lulz Scale, currently in development by [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] staff, will be used to rate everything [[OTI]] on a simple scale of Lulz. The Lulz Scale will vary between [[Uncyclopedia|0]] and [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|Over 9,000]].

===Frunz===
[[Frunz]] is the complete opposite of lulz. See also [[anti-lulz]].

===Limits of lulz===

No matter how lulzy [[you]] think something is, it has a chance of being [[anti-lulz]] or just plain wrong:

{{quote|Some times not even the lulz are worth looking at fuckloads of weird [[furry]] [[pornography]].|[[User:Einsidler|Einsidler]]}}

{{quote|yes they are|[[you]]}}

==Fun fact==

The word "lul" means [[cock]] in the [[Dutch]] language, so whenever someone says "I did it for the lulz" they are quite literally saying "I did it for the cock."

==The Lulls==

Phonetically, the English pronunciation of lulz is also homonymous to the word "lulls", which has Quantum Deep Significance and stands for the fact that no matter how hilarious any gags happen to be, they will eventually become unfunny if repeated too often, at the wrong times, and/or  by the wrong people. When this occurs, the lulz can effectively become the "lulls" in the humor continuum...which open up into gaping, sucking holes leading to the Anti-Lulz. ''You never know when the lulz will suddenly let you down - and the only way to not be at risk for that occurring is to ensure that the lulz never truly matter to you.''  What would happen if the tables turned and the lulz stopped being funny because the laughing-with turned to the laughing-at, and you became the target?  The moment this begins to matter to you, all hope for you becomes lost.  Therefore, it has to not matter, ever...at ALL. 

This shit was actually just made up by some asshat lawn gnome trying to pass itself off as a troll, and  thus must be completely disregarded by your awareness, RIGHT NOW.
