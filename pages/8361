Theory
[[Image:Fuck your theory.jpg|thumb|right|The best response when dealing with opposing research.]]
A '''theory''' is any idea or hypothesis that has yet to be proven undeniably troo by [[science]].  In common usage, the word theory has [[Cum|come]] to mean any [[opinion]] or [[retard]]ed thought that anyone thinks up.  Moarover, the theory does not necessarily have to be based in any kind of [[logic]] or have any regard whatsoever to the real world; just so long as it can't be proven either way, [[you]] can refer to it as a theory.  As such, people often get confused, mistaking [[Holocaust|theory]] for [[JEWS DID WTC|fact]].  If a theory can be continuously [[Prove me wrong|proven]] in all circumstances, it becomes known as a [[Internet law|law]] and [[noone]] bothers to question it.  This subtle difference is what separates petty musings like the theory of gravity from repeatedly tested [[internets]] phenomena such as [[Godwin's Law]].
