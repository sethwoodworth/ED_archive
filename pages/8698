Unwarranted Self-Importance

A theory introduced to civilization in the form of [[Socrates]], '''Unwarranted Self-Importance''' (USI) is a disease that gives you the feeling that you are actually worth something [[You|despite not having made any contributions to anything at all, and actually making the world a much shittier place]], thus making yourself look like a complete douche. 


This is common amongst [[Kanye West]], [[BoA]], [[LiveJournal]] and [[Kuro5hin]] users, [[chav]]s, pre-med or PhD students, [[Apple]] users, [[Kevin Martin|famous weathermen]], Coalition soldiers who have [[Bullshit|actually]] been to [[Iraq]] and anyone who drives some sort of "green" hybrid car while simultaneously expecting your gratitude for saving the [[Earth|fucking earth]]. It occurs on [[ED]] all the time.

Unwarranted self-importance is also often associated with [[flamer]]s or [[n00b]]s, [[America|Americunts]], and anyone who contributes to this page. It will be found on sites where posts or edits are encouraged, as many imagine themselves [[I did it for the lulz|working for some greater power as they upset others]]. It also comes into play when the unwarrantably self-important are [[penis envy|lacking]] in one or more areas of their lives, e.g. [[I Don't Watch TV|being too poor to afford a TV.]] Most people that reward themselves with the feeling that they are important can easily be considered [[attention whore|bastards]].

People who believe themselves important should seek <s>help</s> medical treatment, perhaps because of [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] tendencies - except for [[User:Jacknstock|Jacknstock]], [[b&|who was fucking fired instead]]. USI has become an epidemic, and is spreading faster than diarrhea in a Mexico City restaurant.

==The SCIENCE! of USI==

Luckily, [[Psychology|psychologists]] are hard at work figuring out what causes USI for the sake of building better [[troll]]s worldwide. Next time somebody claims they're totally a big deal, just throw some of these concepts at them:

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority Illusory superiority]: You are better than everybody else. You're a better driver, better worker, and better everything. Of course, the problem is that EVERYBODY thinks this and how can EVERYBODY be better than EVERYBODY ELSE?
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias Self-serving bias]: Your successes are because you're awesome, your failures are because [[The Man|THE MAN]] is keeping you down! Can also be applied to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group-serving_bias groups].
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect Dunning-Kruger effect]: When somebody is so [[fucktard]]ed, they don't even realize they're a [[fucktard]] and continue to do the exact same shit over and over again.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias Choice-supportive bias]: "I knew I shouldn't have bought the full DVD box set for [[Avatar the Last Airbender|this shitty cartoon]] without pirating a few episodes first to see if I like it, but... um... my [[Unrealistic expectations|future kids]] will like it!"
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollyanna_principle Pollyanna principle]: Every compliment you get is [[fact]] even when they're bullshitting and you know it. What are you going to do, tell them that you're not awesome?

==Elitists==
[[Image:Elros.jpg|thumb|Elite is also the name of an [[Israel]]i chocolate manufacturer.]]
[[Image:Prodouchebag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Poseur]]s often have unwarranted self-importance.]]
[[Image:bro1.jpg|thumb|right|USI is a disease that infects 89% of [[douchebags|bros]] everywhere.]]
[[Image:Yahoo_answers_faggot.png|thumb|right|Unwarranted self-importance in its purest form.]]
[[File:Ironicalness.jpg|thumb|Did I misunderstands the orders by posting this here?]]
[[File:Nicktheswing-usi.PNG|thumb|[[TV Tropes]],another reason to hate humanity]]

An ''Elitist'' is an individual who thinks he or she is somehow better than/above the rest of the [[Internets]], yet always manages to have the time to stop and lecture from some moral high ground/soap box.  In [[reality]], they [[fail]] just as hard and often as [[you|the rest of us.]]

Elitists often give their [[opinion]] regardless of whether it is welcomed, and it is always [[truth|condescending or pedantic]] in nature. [[tautology|It kind of is what I'm doing right now.]]

{{quote|What if I <i><u>[[ALLCAPS|AM]]</u></i> so important?|[[You]]}}
If the above quote applies to [[you]], then you are [[Insane|perfectly sane]] and should seek out [[Xenu]] for further guidance.

===Reasons for Elitism===
There are multiple reasons someone may think themselves less pathetic than the rest of the human race. This is usually due to the following reasons:
*They are [[pro-ana|thinner]] than you
*They are [[FYIAD|dragons]]
*They [[Fred Phelps|hate fags]] more than you
*They are [[Ann Coulter|more conservative]] than you
*They are [[hippies|more liberal]] than you
*They [[Tom Cruise|eat moar placentas]] than you
*They have [[Art School|more artistic talent]] than you
*They are [[Asperger's syndrome|more special]] than you
*They [[Atheists|believe in God less]] than you
*They [[Xtian|believe in God more]] than you
*They belong to an [[Furry|oppressed fandom]] that [[Lies|is not a choice]]
*They [[Don Henrie|drink more blood]] than you
*[[douche bag|They]] value [[Fact|The Truth]] more than being liked
*They are [[Cooldude|cooler]] than you
*They have an [[bullshit|older]] [[Wicca|religion]] than you
*They know that [[Hannah Montana|nobody's perfect and they've got to work it again and again until they get it right]]
*They know that the above reason is complete [[faggotry]], and you don't.
*They have more [[Don't_Date_Him,_Girl|venereal diseases]] than you

==Examples of Unwarranted Self-Importance==

===On Wikipedia===
Basically, most Wikipedians are guilty of unwarranted self-importance. The mildest cases are those who think their edits are actually contributing significantly to an encyclopedia. Jimbo-christened administrators have unwarranted importance, but it may or may not be self-importance, since Jimbo seems to think them important (or more important than other peons [yes they are filthy plebs] ). The worst case of unwarranted self-importance are those Wikipedians who have not been Knighted by Jimbo, but pathetically, desperately want to be, like [[wikipedia:User:Jaysweet|this guy]], so they actually start sycophantically acting like administrators,in the hope that their "initiative" will be noted and rewarded. Here is an example of Jaysweet's self-importance:

{{squote|Hi, if you are reading this you saw that I am helping out at the administrator's noticeboard, even though I am not an admin. I believe what I do is useful, and I will continue to do so unless/until an admin asks me to stop. I created the disclaimer after a user became frustrated that he had filed a report and a non-admin had responded. I think I was helpful in that case anyway, but in the spirit of full disclosure, I now often let people know as soon as I answer an ANI report that I am not an admin, especially if I believe the thread will eventually result in admin intervention.|Jaysweet|[[Wikipedia:User:Jaysweet/Why_I_help_out_at_ANI_even_though_I_am_not_an_admin|Source]]}}

===Elsewhere===

{{squote|That's a laugh. I have worked with the F.B.I. and I assure, you do not want to be in their sights. DDOS could involve Homeland Security, and, having some rather good friends in that organization, I would be scared right now, if I were under investigation.

I have had F.B.I. clearance 3 times. I have been interviewed about peoples in this town that work for the government that I know. They are very thorough. A lot of blather going on here.|Zathros|[http://www.myce.com/news/fbi-launches-investigation-of-operation-payback-36410/ Source]}}

== Ironically... ==
Most trolls, [[irony|and even ED itself]], suffer from severe USI.

== How to keep yourself from contracting the USI virus ==

* Step 1: Take down your social networking page. Sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Myspace]] are one of, if not THE most common sources of USI, as most people on there post [[Shit nobody cares about|pictures of themselves on a 3-day smack bender and update their status to show that they're giving head in a strip club restroom]].
* Step 2: Delete your Twitter account. If you want to talk to people, use a fucking phone or your e-mail, dipshit.
* Step 3: If you have an iPhone, get rid of it. [[Fact|USI comes as a standard app on those things, and is another common source of the virus.]]
* Step 4: Avoid sites like [[4chan]], [[DO IT FAGGOT|take them down if possible to prevent others from getting infected with USI]].
* Step 5: Doing things IRL is encouraged, such as going for a walk outside, getting a job, or [[Sex|fucking]].
