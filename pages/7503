''It should be noted that the reference to $10.5 million in the following letter represents the entire net worth of Sierra Leone.''

It is rumored that the admins of [[jailbaitgallery.com]] fled to this country to avoid being arrested by [[chris hansen]]

Hello my dear,

Compliment of the day, I’m Mrs. Joan Buka from sierra-Leone. I picked interest on you after glancing through your short profile, I deemed it necessary to disclose this important issue. I lost my husband during the [[Admiral Ackbar|rebel]] attacked in 2003. 

Before his [[death]], he had an account with a bank here in Cote d’Ivoire, where he made a deposit of US$10.5 Millions Dollars. This money was for the purchase of cocoa procession machines and development of another factory, unfortunately he did not meet his target before his untimely death. 

Why I contacted you, due to the agreement he had with the bank during [[semen|deposit]], I’ve been denied total access to the money, the bank Manager told me precisely that the money was deposited in a suspense fixed account with a clause attached to it for onward transfer into a foreign account. That the bank will follow the agreement written and signed by both (the bank and my husband). I was advised to look for a foreign account where the money can be transferred before I can have access to it. 

Since security here cannot be guaranteed besides, I’ve lost my husband, I hereby ask you to do me a favor by standing as my late husband’s [[serious business|foreign business]] partner and the beneficiary of the money to enable the bank effect the transfer into your account. 

I have plans to invest this money in continuation with the investment vision of my late husband, but not in this place again rather in your country. I have the vision of going into real estate and industrial production, please if you are willing to assist me and my only son Ken, indicate your interest in replying soonest. 

The bank has given me requirements I should forward to them: 
*1. [[Powerword|Your full name, contact postal address]]
*2. [[docs|Your phone and fax numbers]]
*3. [[Job|Occupation]] 

If you agree on this, I’ll give you 15% of the total share when transferred, then 5% will be given to you if you made any expense on the cause of the transfer. Waiting to hearing from you, please once I hear from you I'll send you my pictures, also the deposit certificate the bank gave to my late husband. 

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation, REPLY ME HERE:(joanbuka@katamail.com) Call me: 0022507057738 

Yours, 
Joan Buka
