'''Meele''' is an [[allegedly]] [[insane]] [[stalker]] who likes [[anime]], ''Phantom of the Opera'',  [[artycat|cats]], and [[cosplay]].

== First Impressions ==
Melanie did not have a happy childhood. Her best friend poisoned her cat, which was a present for her fifth birthday, in retaliation for Melanie telling her mother that she was on drugs. She developed tumors on her cheeks as a result of school-related stress, which could only be relieved through acupuncture. She had to give away some of her cats, and some were even born dead, because she was too stupid to spay them.  ''Both'' of her grandparents died.  She suffers from a bad hip induced by a childhood injury, a back injury from being struck with a chain, anxiety from being stalked, an [[centipede filled vagina|undisclosed physical inability]] to have sex, and [[anorexia]] because no-one in her family knows what a supermarket is.

At least, that is how her mother explains why people think Melanie is ugly.  General consensus is that it's genetic.

Her mother reports that Melanie's friends say "that they dont` know how she is able to keep from going insane," but balances that with the [[queer]] "the [[God|good lord]] gives you as much as he knows you can take, with Melanie I would say the cup is over flowing." This supports the basic thesis that Melanie is one of God's mistakes. 

Nobody is 100% sure that Louise, Melanie's mother, actually exists. Apparently, they type under the same accounts in forums, and on various LiveJournals, giving cause for speculation that they may be the same person. Melanie has been known to have more personalities than [[Yinepusayi]], and Louise may be just another one of them -- either that or Melanie may have her mummified corpse hidden in the attic.

== The Phantom of the Opera is Here, Inside My Mind ==

Melanie likes [[Wikipedia:Peter Karrie|Peter Karrie]], an obscure [[British]] actor who has played the Phantom several times in Andrew Lloyd Webber's creepy stalker musical. She likes him so much that all she wants is for him to return her calls, and also to not return to [[Canada]], because if he does then she'll file a restraining order against him. At least one of her personalities appears to believe he sexually molested her when she met him at the theatre's stage door.  

Melanie and/or Louise began their campaign to get him to call them in [[2004]], by threatening to ruin his reputation if he did not get in touch with them. In [[2005]] they began to post their convoluted and contradictory story on more than fifty web sites, where they were furious to be greeted with bafflement and mockery. They are currently engaged in e-lawsuits against a large number of unspecified individuals.
