'''I, for one, welcome our new X overlord''' is yet another insipid internet [[meme]]. It reached its height in [[fail|popularity]] shortly after becoming a subheading of sorts on the [[r9k]] board on [[4chan]].

==History==

The origins of this [[meme]] extend back to when ''The Simpsons'' was a somewhat decent show, capable of delivering [[lulz]]. 

The particular episode in question ("Deep Space Homer") featured a scene with the recurring character and local news anchorman Kent Brockman, who was reporting from Springfield about a live news feed from a space shuttle. Due to an oafish mistake by Homer Simpson, the experimental ant farm on the space shuttle had been broken and the live news feed showed an ant slowly floating across screen. Kent Brockman mistakenly believed the ant was some sort of gigantic ant-like alien and willingly submitted himself to the aliens, betraying humanity, with a declaration on live TV that " And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords".

The complete context of the sentence in that episode can be seen here:

{{quote|Ladies and gentlemen, uh, we've just lost the picture, but what we've seen speaks for itself. The Corvair spacecraft has apparently been taken over -- 'conquered' if you will -- by a master race of giant space ants. It's difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive earth men or merely enslave them. One thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here. And I for one welcome our new insect overlords. I'd like to remind them that as a trusted TV personality, I can be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves.|News Anchor and Enormous Pussy Kent Brockman}}

==Uses==

As with all memes, there is no actual use or application for this anywhere but in fetid bogs like the [[4chan]] or [[SomethingAwful]] forums. As of early August 2009, even [[r9k]] no longer has this particular quote featured as a subheading, so even the asshole of the internet wants to take a courtesy flush on this meme. 

You can apply just about any word for X, creating [[shit|awesome]] new varieties. 

* I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords - '''Original'''
* I, for one, welcome our new robot overlord - '''As seen on [[r9k]]'''
* I, for one, welcome our new sysop overlords - '''Major ass-kisser version'''
* I, for one, welcome our new unoriginal inside joke overlord
* I, for one, welcome our new [[4chan.js|chemo]] overlord

==Doing It Wrong==

[[Image:millhousefail.jpg|thumb|To put it in mathematical equation format, Milhouse<Meme so Milhouse is not X, unless it is (Milhouse+[not a meme])/0.]]

{{quote|I, for one, welcome our new Milhouse overlord.|Milhousefag that forgot Milhouse does not belong anywhere near a meme.}}

Another way to do it wrong is to "[[troll|accidentally]]" word the meme incorrectly, causing [[butthurt|unrest]] as others try to correct you or put you in line. Fair warning, however: further defending your glaring error may result in a classic case of [[Trying Too Hard]] Syndrome. This one, like most memes, is quite tired and very few [[lulz]] can be milked from it alone when trolling.
