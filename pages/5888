'''<3''', otherwise known as the "nutsack", was taken from a [[Bash.org]] [http://bash.org/?500874 quote] in which someone misread the heart [[emoticon]] to be a nutsack. This [[unfunny]] term was quickly adapted all over the internet.

This term is used in a sentence in which one proclaims his/her love or affinity for a certain person, item, ideology or commodity. Such examples are below.


==Usage==
*"I nutsack [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com Encylopedia Dramatica]"
*"I nutsack your art!"
