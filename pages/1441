[[File:024dchr.jpg|thumb|Chase, circa 2009?]]

'''Chasethehedgehog''' is a self-proclaimed [[Failure|Internet celebrity]] and [[Faggot|artist]].  He believes himself to be within the top ten percent at [[DeviantART]] even though he draws like a blind 7 year old with Down's Syndrome. So yeah, he probably is. Born in 1994 and has probably been claiming to be 18 for at least five years now.

Somehow, a [[b|/b/]]tard stumbled across one of Chase's Microsoft [[Paint]] drawings of [[Sonic the Hedgehog|Sonic]] and posted it on /[[b/]] and a link to his page was also featured on the invasion board on [[7chan]]. Literally dozens /[[b/tards]] visited Chase's page and commented about Chase's sad excuse for [[Crap|art]]. As one would expect, those comments consisted mostly of [[Harassment|death threats]].  Since Chase suffers from [[retardation]], he claimed that he had called the [[Internet police|police]] and that they would be coming after all those who threatened him, generating much [[lulz]] within the [[Internets|tubes]].

Despite just about everyone having now realized the breadth of his epic [[fail]], Chase has recently taken to spouting off about how he [[lie|doesn't care what everyone else thinks of his work]], and how his recent milestone of 100,000 page views makes him a god (despite the fact that 90-97% of his views were in the name of milking one heifer of a [[lolcow]], the remainder being in pity). He is, therefore, a [[retard|LIVING PARADOX]]. Chase was also born with a [[Autism|genetic defect that made him unable to detect sarcasm]].

[[Image:Nooneloveschase.PNG|thumb|The Epic Truth]]

==Drama in early 2006==

[[Image:ChasePWN3D.jpg|thumb|A DeviantART mod got Chase pwn3d.]]

Along with the 4chan raids and all other lulz produced by Chase, the lulz began much earlier in 2006 when he posted a journal about how a [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/297089/ flash movie] about Sonic dying made him [[BAWWWWW|cry]].  This resulted in many fierce battles between Chase and the movie's author and several other Deviants who enjoyed it. So much lulz was made then that a deviantART mod came over and made Chase [[pool's closed|close the pool.]]     

A troll account was then made to make friends with Chase, under the name of <del>[http://toxickitsune.deviantart.com/ ToxicKitsune]</del> BALEETED, who posted drawings of the fox and Chase taking it [[in the ass]]. Things got even more lulzy when Chase decided to hold a contest, but all the entries won because they were made of [[buttsecks]]. Two more trolls were made, but in the end, all three trolls got perma-banned, and Chase left a suicide note, taking all his masterpieces with him.     

Nobody is quite sure what happened to Chase after he failed to appear and generate lulz for two whole months. He was long presumed dead, and thought to have sacrificed and essence into the infamous program MS Paint, or sucking cock. However, he recently resurfaced (unfortunately) with a new "Sonic in Soleanna" drawing based off the shittiest game in history.

==100,000==

[[Image:Mobius celebration by chasethehedgehog.jpg|thumb|[[Lulz]]]]

On June 24, 2007, Chase received his 100,000th [[Attention whore|page view]]. Congratulations, Chase! Your failure at life has now been witnessed by [[over 9000|over 100,000]] people; [[you]] must be so proud!

{{quote|"[[USI|its for the big leagues" what are you talking about?? I have over 100000 page views..i AM the big leagues here]].|[http://comments.deviantart.com/5/13836076/499376931 ChaseTheHedgehog, talking to sonicgirl21.]}}

After gaining 100,000 views, Chase's ego exploded in a tidal wave of lab-destined sperm and made a picture out of it. Unfortunately, he assumes that each of these pageviews came from admirers of his sad excuse for art, when he owes 98% of those page views to ED raids. What is in store for the thirteen-year old boy now? Our best guess is that it will include moar Sonic pictures, moar lulz, and moar underage b&.

[[Image:ChaseTheHedgehog Lies by Miniskirt.jpg|thumb|Too bad ConceptArt doesn't give two shits if you're a [[retard|top artist]].]]

Once again, Chase displayed his amazing [[Homosexual|awesomeness]] by posting his personal favorites on [[ConceptArt|ConceptArt.org]]. If you don't know, ConceptArt is a serious art website, run and created for professionals, and built on the ethics of hard work and constructive criticism. Of course, Chase didn't realize this and [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=102945 spew upon the forums such blatant faggotry], it's amazing the whole of the continent didn't blow itself up in a hurricane of egotism that would put Katrina to shame. Chase, of course, completely ignored what anyone had to say and refused to admit that his art was shit so he could finally start improving. Before things reached their climax, an astute [[FYIAD|lulzdragon]] posted a link to the thread on 4chan for all the other [[FYIAD|lulzdragons]] to see. The mods closed the threads before any REAL lulz could be had, but the threads still stands for those of you who are bad enough dudes to save the president.

==[[lie|Chase knows REAL art!!1 SRLSY!!1]]==

In an attempt to stem the flow of [[lulz|criticism]], chase posted a clarification of his earlier comments regarding being better than most people on DeviantART. For you see there is an important fact that the spammers were unaware of; "Many people on here don't even post art"! Yes, chase is referring to the vast collection of sadly misguided individuals who post "junk like photos and poetry", instead of things that require [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/60382432 real artistic skill], like for example...Sonic art!, which is apparently done by many of the BEST artists. After all, "sonic art is not easy to master."

Following in the best spirit of [[faggotry|Unwarranted self-importance]], chase proceeded to announce that since so many artists work for money, he will too. As soon as his parents buy him a scanner, we [[suicide|lucky]] people will be able to order pictures from the great chase for prices tentatively set at between $5 and $30, depending on the number of characters, and whether the drawing is to be done in pencil, or full color. When he was [[PWND|put in his place]] by other DeviantART on his [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/13836076/499360457 comments page], he either made a [[OVER 9000|exceptionally ]][[retard|witless]] remark or an even [[fail|bigger gem]] spewed forth from his mouth.

Chase is now apparently [http://chasethehedgehog.deviantart.com/journal/13836076/ taking commissions]. [[Moron|Who wouldn't want a shitty MS Paint Sonic for $15?]]

== The Protect Chase club! 'stop the flamers!!!11' ==

A group of sad Chase [[faggots|fans]] (most likely alts) made a [[orgy|club]] against Chase haters. The Club has a HUGE amount of [[retards|members]] (4 [[fucktards]]). That includes the [[retarded|famous]] Chase himself. Chase was made the [[faggot|'special member']] by the Chase fan that owns the club. The journal can provide much [[lulz]] in one's spare time.

==YouTube==
Like any good DeviantART extraordinaire, Chase has set up a [[YouTube]] channel so he may share his godly works of art with the world.  As of yet, his channel consists of but one video: a slide show of his work set to a climactic tune, the magnitude of which can only hope to match the caliber of Chase's art.

==Chase's [[Fail|Triumphant]] Return==
With his gay love child [http://ZER0thehedgehog.deviantart.com Zer0thehedgehog], Chase returned.

[[Image:Chase.jpg|thumb|[[Internet]], [[Retard|chase knows how it works.]]]]
[[Image:Chase_subtle.jpg|thumb|Chase: Master of subtlety]]
Chase, after spending much time in hiding from the trolls, the haters, and everyone who offers him constructive criticism, reemerged from the darkness to create a new account under the identity of twisterfiendish. His efforts to remain concealed were thwarted, however, due to the fact that his [[troll|fans]] found him in less than a week of the account's creation. He's attempting to [[sodomy|stick it]] to the man by filling his favorites gallery with [[The Anti-ED-Club|anti-ED]] stamps and "taunting" his enemies with [[butthurt]]-sounding journal entries, all the while claiming that he is not, indeed, [[retard|Chase.]] In a [[fail|failed]] attempt to hide his true identity he changes his profile's country every week or so and doesn't even care to use an online translator to reply in other languages. Currently he claims to be [[German]] and, obviously, blocks everyone trying to comment on his page in the noble language of [[Hitler]]. Some more taste of his [[logic]].

*[http://twisterfiendish.deviantart.com/ Chase's new DeviantART account]

Also once upon a time, Chase decided to join the EdProofDa group on Deviantart to protect himself from the trolls, or so he thought. Being the idiot he is, he fell into the hands of an actual troll who was running the account. It appears chase decided to go into detail as to which he is awesome. He found out that it was a huge mistake talking to EdProofDa after he realized that he was talking nothing but butthurt.

This time, Chase is trying to fool new trolls into thinking he is an admin. He wuld lyk ttly ban any1 dat evun luks @ him bad. He also makes [[awesome]] MS Paint fan art of anyone that trolls him.  Also, Chase will now hide a [[99.9%|certain amount]] of comments that [[butthurt|anger him]]. How will we [[DeviantART#Viewing Hidden Comments|get our delicious fix]] of [[lulz|entertaining]] hate spam now?

==="I AM NOT CHASETHEHEDGEHOG, WHOEVER HE IS"===
[[Image:ChaseIdiotFanart.png|thumb|When it comes to making people look like idiots, Chase is king.  Incidentally, however, the only person he ever makes look like an idiot is himself.]]
{{squote|Listen, people, <b>there is a serious misunderstanding here. people go on and on about how I'm this mysterious chasethehedgehog guy,</b> and because they hate him, no one even barely considers my art, they just hate it because they hate him! Well look around no further and scan the whole site for proof, because that guy's dead, and he's been gone forever. So hate him, I don't care, it's not like he's even around to feel it, but STOP GIVING ME CRAP ABOUT IT! I'm sick of it! I can't even preform as an artist while everyone's all attacking me for no reason and everything! You're going over the edge with this whole thing! I mean, I am SOOOO damn tired of all this abusiveness and attacking. <b>Sure, I used to draw sonic stuff, and I uploaded two old pics, but big deal, I draw weapons now!</b> [[lie|Weapons aren't from any video game]], hello! I drew them myself from nothing and [[MSPaint]]! That's not any fan stuff, so it's not like you can say that you hate any fandom, because all my work comes from the mind!

'''No twelve-year-olds are allowed on this site, ''because it's impossible for them to make art at such a young age according to U.S. Law''''', which is the same law that DeviantART runs by. So wait a year to art, but until then, STOP BOTHERING ME AND LET ME PREFORM MY ART IN '''PIECE'''!

Thanks a bunch, $twisterfiendish.|Chasethehedgehog}}

Further evidence that twisterfiendish is Chasethehedgehog is that they're both fucking idiots.  As you can see from the boldfaced selections in the quote, he comes off claiming not to be Chase.  However, about halfway through, he begins to speak of "drawing Sonic stuff" and "uploading old pics".  But if twister is not Chase, how could he have "used" to draw Sonic fan art or upload "old pics", given that he registered no longer than a week before he posted this?  Get your shit straight, Chase.

Also, more recently, he has made demands that this article is taken down posthaste ([[chasethehedgehog#"Free Art!"|detailed here]]).  If he was not chasethehedgehog, why would this article bother him in the slightest?

<center>[[Image:Proofchase.jpg|Twisterfiend lets slip evidence]]</center>

This is undeniable proof that twisterfiendish is chase:


<center>[[Image:Proff twister is chase.jpg]]</center>

checkmate!

===The Idiot Hat===
[[Image:Joe_the_troll.png|thumb|A summarizing of Chase's intellect.]]
In a desperate attempt to drive away the trolls, Chase has made it his mission to attack them head on [http://twisterfiendish.deviantart.com/journal/25471635/] by drawing shittastic portraits of his enemies which have since been [[baleeted|taken care of]], partly so he still has a [[never|chance]] at becoming admin, partly due to the [[lulz|reaction]] to the hats: [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/126864966/1102714575], [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/126864966/1102751852], [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/126856758/1102624614].

However, this did not last long.  After a while, Chase managed to muster what carcinogenic little brain cells lay in his cobweb filled skull and realized the entire "idiot hat scheme" (which was suggested to him by a troll) was just an effort to show others his true [[retard|level of intelligence]] once again.  Being the [[retard]] that he is, he decided to do one last idiot hat... for a subscription, which he thinks will make him an [[admin]]. The person who [[lied|promised]] Chase a subscription has yet to give it to him.

==="Free Art!"===

After several weeks of duking it out with troll raids from the *chans and Encyclopedia Dramatica while pretending not to be phased, Chase is now offering free art to whomever can "delete" Chasethehedgehog's ED page.  However, this will end in failure for a few reasons:

* Every edit to any article on Encyclopedia Dramatica is saved to the database, making deletion impossible.
* Any vandalism can easily be undone with minimal effort.
* No human being would want a shitty MS Paint drawing from a [[Desu|twelve-year-old retard]].
* Nobody is stupid enough to really support him.





===="Plan M!"====

[[Image:NOW I KNOW MY MASDFS.PNG|thumb|left|Masdf's. She knows them.]]

Chase moved from the now deleted Plan M, whatever the fuck it was, to Plan P. There is no official word on Plans N and O, most likely due to them [[fail]]ing faster than Chase can think them up.

Plan '''M'''asturbate

Plan '''P'''enis

Plan '''K'''KK

'''Breaking news!''' Chase took his dick out of Plan P, and moved on to Plan K.

'''More Breaking News!''' Chase has trashed Plan K and has moved onto Plan C, which apparently is the best plan yet.

'''Moar Breaking News!''' Chase has now actually [[lolwut|declared war on the trolls]]. Naturally this will fail, despite the fact he has actually managed to convince a small group of retards ([http://captainbilly.deviantart.com/ CaptianBilly,] [http://destinymew.deviantart.com/ His ex,] [http://scorcho160.deviantart.com/ Some idiot,] [http://foxclaw100.deviantart.com/ Another idiot,][http://roobyroobyroo.deviantart.com/ A script kiddie who thinks he's so cool because he edited ED to say Chase is awesome] [http://slayaplaya14.deviantart.com/ and lastly the most retarded one of em all, save for Chaseypoo that is.]) He has also [http://twisterfiendish.deviantart.com/art/A-Message-To-My-Army-133340703/ written a small "inspiral speech"] to his [[retard|"troops"]]. On top of that there is a new [http://chat.deviantart.com/chat/twisterwarroom chat] up, which he calls Twisters war room. It contains a link to the aforementioned "inspirational message" and a warning about expert snippers. In the mean time a certain [http://RedRoseStrife.deviantart.com/art/Deck-of-52-King-of-Clubs-133319273 Tartlet] has begun to take advantage of this, and is releasing playing cards, depicting all the highest ranking members of the imaginary troll army Chase has convinced himself exists. While the deck is not completed, it is on its way.
It would appear that the Great Troll War of '09 is about to make its mark on the many pages of Deviantart.

=== Taken Over In Chat Room ===
[[Image:chase_is_gullible.jpg|thumb|left]]
For who knows what reason, TwisterFiendish (a.k.a Chase) made a chat room and viewed it in his journal, warning for 'ALL TROLLS TO STAY AWAY OR ELSE SNIPPERS SHOOT YOU', knowing that trolls and such are going to get in anyway, and also knowing that "snippers" are some kind of scissors, so now, apparently, scissors can shoot bullets now! He soon learned to never trust people... or at least don't forget the people that messes with him. Later on during the chat, while Chase/Twister was away, one of the admins happened to betray him (ya didn't see that coming, did you?) and made everyone in the chat room an admin. Then from there, they did their thing, and banned Chase from his own chat room.


{{squote|How much gullible can this guy get? Now he thinks that chat has a bunch trolls, hacking his chat room just to mess with him, ranted about it in his journal, and started attacking anyone going 'LOLOLOLOLOL' at him. So, he banned everyone from his chat room till next time. We all know he's gonna get memory loss and let in some trolls "without" knowing, and this all is going to happen again.|DevianTART Troll.}}

<s>The troll who actually did the banning decided to remain anonymous, until Chase forgets about it. She got an idiot hat, that's all that needs to be known for now.</s>

It was Movetron.

Chase went into an absolute fit when he found out that he was banned from the chat room. When he regained admin privileges, he [[banned]] all of the other admins in an [[Fail|attempt]] to regain control. It was a few hours later that another troll [[Delete fucking everything|cleared]] his entire ban list.

Also, if you do manage to get into his "new" chat, he'll ban you for the slightest comment or calling him chase.
Even [[Fag|White Knights]].

====FLAWLESS VICTORY. FATALITY!====
DestinyMew has now deleted everything from her deviantTART page probably due to a severe case of butthurt. All that remains is a picture of [[George_W._Bush|Dubya]] flippin the bird, which could possibly mean she's more [[retard|awesome]] than initial reports suggested.

OH SHI-- SHE IS BACK! Like all TARTlets she just can't [[GTFO|stay away]].

==What People Have to Say==
[[File:IcanguessChase.png|thumb|When Chase was indicted by Interpol for posting such terrible artwork and having a gigantic ego, the head of Interpol, Lind L. Tailor, said "The mastermind behind the bad art, known as "ChasetheHedgehog," has an extraordinary ego, and is a hypocritical, vile, and immature tartlet." He then said ""Chase," I can easily guess what you're thinking. You act like a child. You are an evil that must not be allowed to exist in this world. "Chase," you are far lower than the poets and photographers that you think you have the right to judge."]]

| No one is going to fucking rape you. Just teabag you.| [http://ghostlemur.deviantart.com Squid Radiation]

| and you just are uncreative and crappy enough to steal Sega's chaacters, and visually rape them. Even MySpace snapshots own you| [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/13836076/518132963 RuneFaust owning Chase.]

| you are a sad little child.| [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/13836076/522915239 PearlHeart, poet], giving Chase the news.
|Doesn't matter if you like it or hate it, it's still art. And I won't get started on that photography comment. There are are too many things to say, and you're just not worth the time.| [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/13836076/527578634 Even a FURRY hates Chase!]

| You don't have the talent to take a good photo.| [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/13836076/528132233 IZSBHR talking to Chase.]

|Does that mean Chase is going to kill Jews? 
Come to think of it, Hitler also started off as a terrible artist...o,O;;| [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/13836076/518136778 Best deviantART convo ever.]

|You know nothing about art. You spend two seconds to draw a shitty sonic doodle while good photographers work for hours just to get a photo to come out just right. It's more than just "pressing a button," you have to have the right equipment so a photo comes out looking better than just a snapshot. You can't compare yourself to them, fan boy. I don't give a shit about what your "opinion" is because your opinion is retarded.
As for poetry, people spend a hell of a lot more time and effort on poetry and other writing than you'll ever spend on your stupid sonic MSpaint doodles. You can barely spell your own comments and journal, so how can you compare yourself to writers?| [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/13836076/509722315 Epic winning by BloodstainHurricaneX.]

|"but photography is not art. its basically cheating"
YEP. THAT'S CHEATING. YET DRAWING A BLOB AND FILLING IT WITH RED AND CALLING IT A HEDGEHOG ISN'T. :c| [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/13836076/516677726 Another great conversation by *Relientk-nux.]

|Excuse me, but you are a retard.

Photography takes hours, even days sometimes. There's a lot to do, from hours and hours of makeup, to wardrobe, to prop placement and lighting setup, to digital mastering, along with a lot of very very expensive equipment. How you can even compare yourself to photographers is beyond me, seeing as your three-second-paint-doodles hardly pass for discernible shapes, much less 'art".

As for writing, you have no room to talk. You can barely spell your own name, much less write a novel or a poem. And if you did write a story, it would probably be a dime-a-dozen fan-fic with no plot or imagination (or grammar) that wouldn't be worth the 2kb it takes up on your hard drive.

Seriously, you have a massive ego that's grossly disproportionate to your skill. You only have those "OMG 100,000 PAGE VIEWS" from the tons of people coming here to laugh at your failure. It wouldn't even be so bad if it weren't for you shoving your e-penis into everyone's faces like you're some kind of god when your art is on par with something a kindergartner finger-painted.|[http://comments.deviantart.com/5/13836076/754651251 Slightly TL;DR, but still lulz.]

|ChasetheHedgehog, your grammar is so poor that even my +10 in Language:Chat Speak cannot save me.

Roll a Fortitude Saving Throw versus No Artistic Talent, oh shit, you rolled a 1, you now are permanently deprived of any artistic talent, though you never had any in the first place.| [http://thedarkmage.deviantart.com TheDarkmage] Even D&D jokes are better then Chase's artwork.

|Can you understand this language? If not, then...

0K@EE, C@N U UNDURst@nd me now???????
oka, you pic is tribblee fukeng baaaaaaaaaaad
die in hell i hatee u| [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/40559724/1027947300 doomgrip776 pwning Chase.]

|Poetry and photography ARE art, you egotistical fuck. Your ego is bigger than Russia and the USA (including Canada) combined.|[http://wolfey-evil-princess.deviantart.com Wolfey-Evil-Princess], politician

|So you say that your crap is art but photos and poetry are not?| [http://okamixami.deviantart.com/ OkamiXami]

|Oh, for fuck's sake. God made a mistake when he shat you out.

"they only do junk like photos and poetry"

What? if photography and poetry is junk then what the hell is the shit that you've been posting? It looks like it's been done by a blind five year-old. You're so creative aren't you? EET LOOKS LYK SONIC BUT ITZ RED!!!1!!1!!ZOMG!!1!ONE!1!!11!1!ELEVEN!!! GENIOUS! LOLZ@!1

Real artists appreciate art in every form it comes in.

|Chase draws terrible| [http://myahthetiger.deviantart.com/ MyahTheTiger] ORLY

|i just lol'd so hard at this| [http://mystiique.deviantart.com/ Mystiique ]

|WHAT?! YOU BITCH.| [http://catiethedark.deviantart.com/ CatieTheDark]
|You know, for someone who really hates other people's opinions, you sure bloody love to give your own tww cents about everything. Here's a good idea:
Stop expressing YOUR opinions, and maybe everyone else will stop expressing THEIRS. Here's how a troll works, kiddo, because you haven't figured it out already:
1) Find someone who thinks they're all that
2) Poke it.
3) Point out contradictions.
4) flame videos and pictures made in response. Seriously, just don't make anti-troll pictures. It worsens everything.
And lighten up. The only people too good for ED to troll are Morgan Freeman and Ninjas. you're nuts if you compare yourself to them.
I'm not trying to troll here, but... c'mon, dude. You make a complete mockery of the word 'art'. Sonic's great and all, but make more of an effort. Get a better program, learn to shade... If not for yourself, then in the name of Sonic and ART.|[http://rubbishcarrot.deviantart.com/ Rubbishcarrot, being a lulz-killer by trying to make Chase better himself]Also, rather TL;DR.}}</center>

== '''The "Troll War"''' ==

Recently, Chase's faggotry took it to the next level when he declared a troll war, demanding that people turn over the [[faggot|troll leader]]. This of course sparked numerous lulz as many a troll stepped up, claiming themselves to be the leader of the trolls. The most notable of these self proclaimed "troll leaders" was the blatantly obvious GeneralTroll, who wrote an extensive forfeit letter in his [[http://generaltroll.deviantart.com/]]. Chase, being the faggot that he is, does not know that trolls have no leader, as they are in it for the lulz. During this so called "war", Chase has compared himself and his merry band of douches to [[wigger|Abraham Lincoln]], but he has [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|edited that journal entry in an attempt to look like less of a cockfag.]]


== Now is your opportunity to support the Lulztrain! ==

Chase has made it possible for you to buy into his faggotry and buy Twister Brand Hats, Cups and shirts. [http://www.cafepress.com.au/twisterfiendish.416229235] Support the lulz! Buy an ULTIMAET SHADOW!!!11oneone TSHIRT today.
And yes, it IS Chase's Merchandise according to his poll [http://twisterfiendish.deviantart.com/journal/poll/828964/].
But whatever the [[fuck]] you do, don't wear it in public. You may also drink from an [[Idiot]] Hat mug to Twister's everlasting idiocy, and a Zapdos Hat, which unfortunately, hasn't got the idiot hat on it. Poor Merchandising, Chase.

== The 2nd "Troll War" ==
[[Image:Twisterchatowned.jpg|thumb|His #TwisterWarRoom chat in a terrorist attack with ebaumsworld.on.nimp.org]]

Yes.  He has returned with a [[boner|vengeance]].  And he's not fighting [[trolls]] this time.  He's up against "some [[deviantart|dA]] [[terrorist]] organization".  He claims they even took out a few of his secret [[snippers]].  He is also fed up with [[you|people]] telling to "[[Chris-chan|CHECK INTO A MENTAL HOTEL]]."  He also states some people are threatening him with "[[Spax3|lawsuits]] and [[hacking]]".

== Contest ==

[[Image:Chasewarspic.png|thumb|The winner of his contest made [[win|this.]]]]

Chase decided it would be a great idea to have another [[fail|contest]].
[[trolls|Contestants]] would have to draw a picture of his [[lie|SO NOT CHASE]] character, [[furry|Twister da Hedgehog.]] Chase, being the [[retard]] he is, thought it was also a great idea to send a [[fail|handmade piece of art.]] Although being told that it would probably result in the [[winrar|winner]] spreading his address all over the [[Internets|tubes]], [[dumbass|he still wants to send his "special gift" to the winner]]. B-Comes-Before-L won.

His address:(Note a tax building so probably where his parents work)
Twisterfiendish c/o
"You Sell" Ship 'N' More
20 North Summit Street
Crescent City, Florida 32112

== Contest 2 ==
Chase has announced a second contest to draw a scene from the supposed troll war.[http://twisterfiendish.deviantart.com/journal/30557942/]

The contest ended 20th of Feb, but since chase had to go back and make moar monies at McDees, the winner got their prize on the 25th. You can see the winners artwork [http://ungdi-sea.deviantart.com/art/GDI-X0-153913092 here]

== OMG SPEAKING REQUIREMENTS!!! ==
There are now rules to talk to Chase. Aparantly now you must do the following before you can speak to him.

1.) You have to have a non-troll avatar. The awesome face, an ED logo, and ANONYMOUS don't count and will get you either ignored and/or banned.
2.) You have to make real art, not just dumb troll art.
3.) You must have more than 10 friends.
4.) You should avoid cussing as much as possible.
5.) If you wanna have bad things to say, you'd better offer useful advice too, and not "KILL YOURSELF" or "STOP DRAWING" or stuff like that
6.) No advertisement!
7.) No spam!
8.) No flaming!
9.) No being jealous!
10.) No racism!
11.) No bad memes!
12.) No theft!
13.) No hacking!
14.) No spying!
15.) No being an overall jerk!
16.) ...
17.) oh wait I skipped 16
16.) No dissing Sonic. He is awesome.
17.) No calling me Chase.
18.) Respect other people!

...but wait, he doesn't meet #2!  wouldn't that mean he can't talk to himself?

== Chatroom hacking ==
Chase's chatroom, #TwisterWarRoom, has been hacked so many times it's not even funny anymore. But if you'd like to get a chance to fuck shit up in there just for the [[lulz]], just ask that furfag [http://zack-the-dragon.deviantart.com Zack] for a [[promotion]].

== New Chat! ==
Attempting to regain control of his troll war, Chase decided to make a new chatroom here: [http://chat.deviantart.com/chat/UberRoom]. Obviously, it's always a [[retarded|great]] idea to post a link to your "troll free" chat.

==Snippers==
[[File:Snippers1.png|thumb|Artist's interpretation.]]
Snippers are some type of scissors frequently mentioned by the Internet celebrity himself. He claims that these scissors have the ability to shoot bullets, which helps him defeat [[troll]]s, rather than go through the trouble of being teabagged by them due to his lack of sexual edutainment necessary to [[rape]] them. What remains to be asked about "snippers" is where they're manufactored. Most likely a [[Muslim|terrorist]] orgamization by forking them out of their ass just like every [[Shit|part]] of [[Roblox]]. If you need any more info about this wonderful topic, the schematics of the snipper are drawn in MS Paint by Chase himself.

==-Ducks are faster than hedgehogs. -NO!==
Apparently, Chase has been spending too little time IRL looking at stuff, and it is supposed that he's never seen a real hedgehog. Not to mention a real duck. Around December 2010 it got him into a spirited discussion with [http://leekduck.deviantart.com the latter] and [http://i-hate-commercials.deviantart.com a voice of reason] over which is faster. Lack of reality check, [[retard|retardation]] and [[furfag|sonicfaggotry]] has made him claim badly that [[lie|a hedgehog would outrun a member of waterfowl]]. Desperately trying to prove his point, he has made many [[dumb]] mistakes. In his little autistic world:

* Ducks are mammals
* [[lolwut|Ducks are slower than gravity]]
* [[divide by zero|An electric current is slower than almost everything]]
* Hedgehogs have the same amount of feet as hedgehogs

obviously generating [[lulz]]. Check out yourself here: [http://twisterfiendish.deviantart.com/#/d34au8t]. No better way to prove your point than to make a shitty MS Paint pic, [[amirite]]?

== A Challenger(s)? appears ==
Apparently some people, Motivated by Encyclopedia dramatica have started to undertake a mission to redraw every single artwork done by chase, albeit BETTER as in, not troll art OMFG ! Shit just got real! -> It's a Troll doing the Art! and he's a Limey! http://tornadobugger.deviantart.com/art/Bloody-Work-Part-1-189527818
