Mod Sass

[[Image:Originalmodsass.jpg|thumb|The first recorded incident of mod sass and subsequent [[b&]]]]
When you're called out on your [[bullshit]] by a [[mod]] or a [[sysop]] on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|Encyclopædia Dramatica]], a [[forum]], or even our very own [[ED_Forums|EDF]] (And you will be), the timid cowardly [[sheep]] of society will simply stop what they're doing and lurk for awhile.  When you write yourself into an article and soon find your user page covered in [[Porn|(un)desirable images]], the timid cowardly sheep of society would get the hint and apologize to the person who put it there.  However, anyone with an actual ounce of self worth will actually stand up for their rights.  Unfortunately for these poor souls, all mods of any website, forum, [[IRC]], etc. in real life have godly powers.  They can snap their fingers and have you die [[IRL]].  They can teleport into your room physically and then beat you up.  [[Srsly]].  So if you piss off a mod [[OTI]], they will make your IRL hell. All mods must be feared and respected.  <b>SIEG HEIL!</b>

==Definition==
[[Image:Permabanned.gif|frame|Mod sass in real time.]]
Ranked as the #1 way of earning yourself a piping hot stack of bancakes, mod sass is the act of giving a mod or a sysop sass when you are ordered to cease your [[faggotry]] and read either [[ED:101]] or [[ED:VIP]], or just [[stop posting]] altogether.  Depending on where it takes place, some mods may not even care, while others will obliterate you off of the face of the interbutts if you start any shit.  Two exceptions to this rule are that mod sass is always acceptable on [[Uncyclopedia|any other wiki]] and all chan boards.

==Reasons for Mod Sass==

* [[Butthurt]]
* [[Unwarranted Self Importance]]
* [[Trolling]]
* Fucking six dogs in the ass
* Temptation
* [[Mthrfkn|The mod is a complete dick]]
* The mod in question is [[moot]] and if moot bans you, it means you are super cool now because he actually acknowledged your existence.
* Any combination of the above

* Continuing to write shit articles even after having [[Template:Dummies|this]] slapped on your talk page.
* Calling the mod or mods a [[faggot]] when told to [[STFU]].
* [[User:Stevejoe13|Making a new account to whine on the forums about your ban.]]
* [[Moon_beam_750|Saying that you should replace a mod on the forums because you're too fat for your jeans.]]
* [[Reverting]] or [[vandalizing]] anything [[ED Sysops Active Duty Roster|made by a sysop]].
* Fucking with or removing templates that are put on your user or user talk pages by a sysop.
* Vandalizing a sysop's talk page, [[VIP|which is automatically reverted]], after having your terrible article baleeted.
* Not providing your tits after being [[Tits_or_GTFO|politely requested]] by a sysop.
* Not writing stuff on your forehead in lipstick for [[User:ShitsSoCash|Ca$h]] and posting the pix.
* Being a mod and sassing yourself.
* Breathing the wrong way.

| valign="middle" style="overflow:hidden; padding:0 1em; text-align:left;  font-style:italic;" | &nbsp;<br />I got a theory about this list. See, when you sift through ED, you'll notice two things: It's only funny when it's pointing out the truth (well, so long as it's never about themselves, 'cus when you make fun of ED, that's crossing the line!) and there's a bunch of internet nobodies you've never heard of. My theory the average ED editor is such a profound loser that he can't be bothered to think up anything clever, or witty, or satirical by the dictionary definition of the word (or do anything of actual signifigance with their lives, for that matter), so they piss off whoever happens to get within reach so they write up some dumbass article full of racial and homophobic slurs. That shit's edgy, yo. Lulz and whatnot.
 
"Oh, Tabby! You're just cranky 'cus your inbox is being constantly flooded with messages you don't give a rat's ass about!" True, voice in my head, true. But I've tried retrieving my password once and tried getting off this damned list three times, and clearly that ain't workin', so here's what gonna happen: I'm gonna try to unsubscribe to this crap one more time, then I'm spamming you assholes with whatever shit I feel like harassing you with until I get taken off this damned list. We'll see how you like it until you figure out how to filter your email and eliminate my minor annoyances! THE DAY IS MINE NOW!

==Mod Sass on ED==
[[Image:Repost.png|thumb|What happens when you repost your deleted article.]]

Mod sass on ED is one of the most heinous of acts, even worse than [[pædophilia]], [[bestiality]], or being Jew.  Doing so will bring down upon you the terrible wrath of the [[Sysop|gods]] and their almighty [[banhammer]].  Anyone who would defy their authority will be left to rot in the banned list with a bloody, [[Goatse|gaping asshole]].  There is zero tolerance for it here and consequences are worse than being burned in hellfire for eternity.  If you've really pissed someone off, there will be more consequences than just a permanent ban from ED in its entirety.  Here is an eyewitness account of what might happen:

{{squote|I'd be very careful in insulting the mods, even playfully... I have witnessed their terrible final form: a Legion-style coming together of penis in ass, penis in penis, finger in ear and ass, toes in mouth, tongue in bellybutton, nose in eye-socket and penis in every other hole transformation into one single, exceptionally fat monster of unjust punishment, dark lulz and ultimate hellfire. This awful beast of the murk belches cheetos smoke and gurgles a sick slime, as bodily fluids from the mods are leaked and sucked into one another, like a primitive blood, ejaculated throughout the creature...so to all those posting here, BE WARNED.|Flu|warning the rest of you.}}

In short, you'd better learn your place you fucking dirty peasant.  Don't be that person.  Don't be a faggot.

==Getting Even==

What if you get banned for mod sass? Well, he who lulz last, lulz loudest.
