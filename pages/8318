The Tale of the traveling Afghan War Diaries
{{pixplz}}
{{Spoiler|Trust [[Noone]]}}
On Sunday, July 26 5pm EST, [[Wikileaks]] dropped a [[drama bomb|major drama bomb]] that greatly surpasses all other drama bombs. Over [[over 9,000|96,000 pages]] that covers around 91,000 different reports and incidents about the Iraq and Afghanistan war from 2004-2009. The majority of these reports are from individuals reporting about incidents ranging from raids, corruptions, bribes, patrols, suicide bombings, etc. Alone these reports seem to document typical happenings in war, together they paint a [[gore|grim picture]] about how [[antilulz|bad]] the war in Afghanistan and Iraq is going.

==What is the big deal?==
What everyone is complaining about is [[Ted Stevens|you cannot simply dump this much info onto the internet at once]], such action  will overwhelm the internet. These people argue that Arab will manage to get these 96,000 pages downloaded without Big Brother frying their computer for simply looking at this leak. These people also claim that due to these documents being leaked that American soldiers will die because some asshole was unpatriotic enough to leak documents about the war. 

An hour later, these same people who deemed the leaker as unpatriotic have withdrawn their earlier statements as it turns out that nothing so far in the report is actually about [[rape|Obama's surge]] or any currently active operation. According to these people, the majority of the documents examined at this point suggests that these are reports from incidents that have already happened. Not only that nearly all of these [[boring|classified]] reports are the lowest level of classification, at a mere '''secret'''. Currently the most uncovered classified documents included in this report discovered so far is about how NATO covers up how they [[accidentally|accidentally]] kill children by firing rockets at houses they believe are housing suspected terrorist leaders. It is unsure how they are "suspected" terrorists as Arab are all terrorists.

{{quote|Each report consists of the time and precise geographic location of an event that the US Army considers significant. It includes several additional standardized fields: The broad type of the event (combat, non-combat, propaganda, etc.); the category of the event as classified by US Forces, how many were detained, wounded, and killed from civilian, allied, host nation, and enemy forces; the name of the reporting unit and a number of other fields, the most significant of which is the summary - an English language description of the events that are covered in the report.|Wikileaks, explaining what the leak documents}}

===The Prince Weighs In===
Now this is a story all about how<br>
My war got flipped-turned upside down<br>
And I'd like to take a minute<br>
Jus' sit there man<br>
I'll tell you how Wikis ratted on Afghanistan<br>

In west Helmand province, born and raised<br>
In the hum-vee was where I spent most of my days<br>
Chillin out maxin relaxin all cool<br>
And shootin' some children outside of their school<br>
When a couple of guys<br>
Who were up to no good<br>
Started leakin' secrets in my neighborhood<br>
I got on one lil wiki and I said in frustration<br>
"We strongly condemn the disclosure of classified information"<br>

I whistled for a plane<br>
And when it bombed near<br>
The pilot said "We hit those civvies, oh dear"<br>
If anything I could say the generals don't care<br>
But I thought "Naw forget it, good goin' in the air!"<br>

I pulled up in Herat about 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to the natives "Yo homes, smell ya later!"<br>
Pulled out my rifle<br>
Shot them all dead<br>
Then Wikileaks said, that I'd lost all my cred<br>

==List of the Drama (more to come!)==
* [[lulz|The Pakistani Intelligence Agency whose job is to help fight the Taliban is actually aiding the terrorists]].
* [[common knowledge|The Afghanistan government is corrupt]]
* The Taliban are being supported by [[Russia|outside]] [[China|powers]].
* [[obvious|The US invaded Iraq and Afghanistan so they can surround Iran in preparation for an upcoming invasion]].
* The Taliban are much better armed than the US is reporting.
* US forces have killed a large number of civilians as well as their own and afghan troops.

==Who Dunnit?==

It was [[Lady Gaga]].

{{tinyquote|I would come in with music on a CD-RW labeled with something like [[Lady Gaga]], erase the music then write a compressed split file. No one suspected a thing and, odds are, [[orly|they never will.]] I listened and lip-synced to Lady Gaga’s 'Telephone' while exfiltrating possibly the largest data spillage in American history. Weak servers, weak logging, weak physical security, weak counter-intelligence, inattentive signal analysis… a perfect storm.|PFC Bradley Manning}}

This time, it wasn't the [[weev|usual suspect]] but a pissed-off US Army [[btard|intel analyst]] in [[Baghdad]] called Bradley Manning. On July 30th, 2010, an [[aspie]] hax0r aptly named [[Adrian Lamo]] went to [[old media]] and [http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/07/29/lamo.profile.wikileaks/?hpt=C2 told CNN] why he'd [[facefagged]] the [[Kale|US Intel Analyst]] for leaking the [[dox]]. Apparently the brave soldier [[Bradley Manning]] was pissed off with being in the sun all day and felt [[so ronery]] he randomly hit on Lamo on [[snugglenet]] IRC. Since being diagnosed with [[PTSD]] or some shit, he'd been reassigned to setting up the stage and latrines for a USO show for the troops featuring [[fap|cheerleaders.]]

====Logs====
''The below is excepted from a lengthy exchange [http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/06/wikileaks-chat/ between Lamo and Manning on Wired].''
<pre>
(7:20:26 AM) Lamo: how’re you feeling today?
(7:20:37 AM) Manning: im feeling a little better…
(7:20:52 AM) Manning: i had a lot on my mind, keeping to myself
(7:22:18 AM) Lamo: anything new & exciting?
(7:24:21 AM) Manning: no, was outside in the sun all day… 110 degrees F, doing various details for a visiting band and some college team’s cheerleaders…
(7:24:43 AM) Lamo: cheerleaders.
(7:24:46 AM) Manning: ran a barbecue… but no-one showed up… threw a lot of food away
(7:25:20 AM) Manning: yes, football cheerleaders… visiting on off season… apart of Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR) projects
(7:25:39 AM) Lamo: *sigh*
(7:26:01 AM) Manning: >shrug<
(7:26:37 AM) Manning: im sunburned… and smell like charcoal, sweat, and sunscreen… thats about all thats new

===Adrian Lamo===
[[File:Lamo_article_main.jpg|left|thumb|[[lmao|Lamo]]. You can help by stalking [http://www.facebook.com/felon?v=wall] him on Facebook]]
[[File:Lamo_twitter.png|thumb|300px|Super douchey patriot]]
The [[old|30 something]] hacker and [[lulzkiller]] went on to say that he went public with Manning's name because he "[[what|didn't want to be a coward]]." It should be pointed out that at his age, he is still eligible for military service and if he really didn't want to be a coward, he would have been standing neck deep in sand and camel shit right along with PFC Manning instead of getting all [[USI]] to the media from his Sacramento [[hugbox]]. Ironically, Lamo now faces an angry mob who wants him [[dead]]. He says he has received death threats in person and on his [http://www.facebook.com/felon?ref=ts#!/felon?v=wall&ref=ts Facebook] page and [http://twitter.com/6 Twitter] messages from people who feel like he betrayed PFC Manning.

As for Manning, he's just a fucking idiot because he believed his "confession" would remain off-the-record after swallowing Lamo's bullshit that he was an ordained minister. Manning has been charged with eight violations of the U.S. Criminal Code, including allegedly illegally transferring classified data.

In 2004, the self-described [[1337]] hacking superstar Lamo was convicted of one count of [[SFB|computer crimes]] after breaking into the [[New York Times]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Lexis-Nexis]]' computer systems. Lamo also admitted to haxing '''Excite@Home''''s company network and breaking into the internal networks of [[Yahoo!]] and MCI WorldCom. Like [[Goatsec]] Lamo claims that [[lie|he did this as a public service]] and only went public after informing the hacked networks as to their [[goatse|gaping security holes]]. 

Unlike [[Weev]] however, [[lmao|Lamo]] is an unlulzy faggot with [[hueg]] levels of [[USI]] and was starring in his own [http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5573874/Hackers_Wanted_(2008) "documentary" ''Hackers Wanted: Can You Hack It? The 'Homeless' Hacker Adrian Lamo'''] at the time of his arrest. [[Unemployed]] and flopping from city to city by Greyhound bus, Lamo was [[Internet famous]] for being "[[hobosexual|The Homeless Hacker]]." When he surrendered to face charges for the Times hack [[camwhore|he has a camera crew in tow]]. He was ultimately sentenced to [[basement dweller|six months home confinement at his parents’ home]].

==Conclusion==
At first when this info was leaked it seemed that the person who did this <s>was</s> is motivated by [[jews|greed]]. However, as more is read into these documents, it seems that the leaker didn't steal all this info solely for the intent of selling their story years down the road, but was motivated by a sense of [[moralfag|justice]]. Despite that none of this information being leaked will compromise any current action in the war, the [[Obama|White House]] is throwing a shit fit and will likely [[ruination|crucify]] the leaker. The sad part of this whole affair is it will likely lead to new stricter laws to punish whistle-blowers. Such laws will damage the freedom of speech and the willingness to report corruption and injustice that keep our government a republic.
