{{quote|the fact that this is still on is indicative of the trend of networks squeezing every last drop of out a series and then grinding the dust for more flour for their next shit cake. i used to love this show up until the fucking musical episode and now i can't stand it even when i'm high.|[[420chan|Ebenezer Nommlebitch]]}}

'''The Fairly Oddparents''' is one of many shitty animated shows on Nickelodeon. Created by [[faggot|Butch Hartman]], it is plagued by cookie cutter writing, repetitive gags, substandard animation, flanderized characters and [[Simpsons|being on the air way too long]]. The show uses an inferior flat animation style because the animators don't know how to draw a cylinder or hand correctly. [[Family Guy|Every episode is the same and the writers just insert different pop culture references and repetitive gags to change it just enough so that the audience doesn't notice]]. The Fairly Oddparents is notable because it was one of the first American shows on Television to be this shitty. It's one of those shows that will not die. They tried to kill it before, But then it came back with a baby, [[shit nobody cares about|who was wished for by Timmy because Cosmo and Wanda can't have a kid on their own]] ,and became even shittier. They're afraid to kill it again because it would probably [http://www.tv.com/the-fairly-odd-parents/a-top-secret-fairly-oddparents-project!-hint-its-andquotaliveandquot/topic/2877-1337446/msgs.html come back as a half-assed movie]. 

==The Fairly Oddparents is super fabulous!==

{{quote|It's straight... in a gay kind of way. XDDD (That actually sums up the show itself. :'D)|bradsgurl}}

So you're part of the [[Basement-dweller|rank and file netizens]] that thought that [[SpongeBob Squarepants|Spongebob]] was [[gay]]. Well it's a little known fact that [[Fact|FOP is way gayer than spongebob could ever hope to be]].

*ITS ABOUT <strike>FURRIES!</strike> FAIRIES! 
*In the episode [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOaaBRPC0PM&feature=related Fairy Fairy Quite Contrary] Timmy and Remmy Buxaplenty could be seen playing a game called 'Virtua Stud' which is a reference to the 1995 hard core gay porno film [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310318/ Virtual Stud.]

*In the episode [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw3oVj2I7Q8&feature=related Action Packed] there was a loose cannon cop on the edge who doesn't play by the rules named Ryan McCain which is a reference to a [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2204001/ Ryan McCain] who was in the gay porno Black Cocksuckers 2.

*FOP has tremendous amounts of [[Transvestite|cross-dressing]], one good example is the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML4lhUA3Ti4&feature=related Miss Dimsdale] episode where Timmy's dad tried to enter the Miss Dimsdale beauty competition, in a dress. Worse yet, Adam West expressed interest in him. 

*In the opening of the Fairly Oddparents episode [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFxtBZfa16M&feature=related The Boy Who Would Be Queen] Timmy is seen enjoying the soap opera ''The Kissy Kissy Goo Goo Romance Hour'' on a portable TV. If that wasn't gay enough yet, later in the episode [[LOL WUT|he is turned into a girl]] and develops a new appreciation for comic books because they have [[no homo|"muscular guys in spandex fighting crime."]]

*In the episode [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T7S2We45rM&feature=related Nectar of the Odds] it turns out the recipe for best tasting lemonade that Timmy could come up with included some of Cosmos [[cum|''fairy juice.'']] The episode has inspired some [http://Garabatoz.deviantart.com/art/Cosmo-Flavor-128097901 pretty delicious fan art] on [[devianTart]]. 

*According to the article [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a913643474~db=all~jumptype=rss The Boy Who Would Be Queen: Hints and Closets on Childrenâ€™s Television] Dr. Jeffry P. Dennis wrote "on the teenage Web site [[My Space|myspace.com]], [[tl;dr|over 10% of the profiles that list Fairly Oddparents among their interests identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual]]."

*In the episode ''Fairly Odd Baby'' Cosmo and Wanda have their own fairy baby. Guess who has it? [[Fag|Cosmo]], that's right, the [[transvestite|''guy'']] fairy. But wait, there's more. At the end they name their purple male fairy baby ''Poof''. Yes, of all the possible names they could have given it, they name it ''Poof''. This is also British slang for a homosexual male.

*Timmy's teacher, Denzel Crocker, is a reference to [http://www.iafd.com/person.rme/perfid=DannyCrocker/gender=m/Danny-Crocker.htm Danny Crocker], a gay porn star in the early 90's. Both share the same initials.

*[[WTF|The mayor of Dimmsdale is a goat.]]

Due to FOP's status as number 2 most popular show on Nick it sort of flew under the christian gaydar when James Dobson went gallivanting around saying that Spongebob was gay because of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnD8BYjZiW0 that little tolerance video] he was a part of. Amazingly though the Fairly Oddparents were featured in that video too. Why didn't Dr. Dobson say anything about FOP? [[Probably|Shouldn't the christfags have been preventing their kids from the evils of FOP before spongebob?]] [[yes|They couldn't have just targeted spongebob because it was slightly more popular at the time, right?]] [[Lie|Of course not, they're all reasonable moral upstanding individuals who cannot lie or mislead anyone in the eyes of god]].

In addition to gay references, the show contains overt references to [[sex]], [[bestiality]], [[incest]], anti-Semitism, and [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FetishFuel/TheFairlyOddParents an assortment of fetishes for all ages].

==Fairly Oddparents, or Family Guy Jr.?==
Seth Macfarlane and Butch Hartman are [[Buttsex|butt-buddies]], so it's no surprise their shows are nearly identical...

*Butch Hartman, the creator of the Fairly Oddparents, worked with [[shit|Family Guy]] creator Seth Macfarlane on Johnny Bravo.
*Butch Hartman worked with Seth Macfarlane on a short animation called [[Bestiality|Zoo Mates]].
*Hartman worked on a few episodes of Seth's show Family Guy, including Brian, Portrait of a Dog.
*Both FOP and FG share [[cumdumpster |Sarah Frost]] as a director.
*Both Seth and Butch are [[Atheists]].
*Dr. Hartman on Family Guy is named after Butch Hartman.
*Both Family Guy and The Fairly Oddparents have outrageous amounts of [[trying too hard|pop-culture references woven into their episodes.]]
*Both show's themes were written by Ron Jones.
*Both shows have Adam West in multiple episodes.
*Both shows have had [[KISS]] in at least one episode.
*Both shows endorse homosexuality, [[fact|and want you to become gay]].
*[[truth|Both shows suck.]]

==Fans==
[[Image:Oddparentscomputer.jpg|thumb|Internet [[stalker]] in his basement.]]
The Fairly Oddparents has a diverse little fan base, ranging from your average [[13 year old girl]] to your [[Basement-dweller|20 something basement dweller]] who lurks on [[Co/|/co/]] 24/7.
<center>Let's take a look at this [[Lie|20 something]] [[Olchai]].

==Trolling Material==
The place to troll internet users with FOP is [[Co/|/co/]], the place on [[4chan]] where [[Olchai|grown men discuss the finer points of comics and cartoons]]. Any FOP related post will immediately be responded to by a shitty trip fag who has zero troll detection abilities and will take anything FOP related very seriously, especially any sort of minor criticism towards his [[waifu]] Trixie. You may find trolling /co/ very easy as they are a bunch of [[Emo|emotionally fragile]] people taking [[no life|refuge on the internet]] and [[pedophile|find comfort in watching children's shows]]. 

How to troll people with The Fairly Oddparents. 
*Say that The Fairly Oddparents is the same show as Family Guy.
*Say that Poof is a good character design.
*Say that when Timmy Turner grows up he will Marry Tootie and not Trixie Tang (This works vice versa for Tootie [[fanboys]]).
*In fact, saying anything bad about Tootie or Trixie will draw the wrath of the hordes of faggots. Mostly Trixie, as she is Asian and thus more of a [[weeaboo]] [[Yellow Fever|magnet]].
*When you see a Trixie Tang thread, immediately respond to it with an [http://blogs.redding.com/mbeauchamp/archives/Tang.gif image of the tang drink mix].
*Say that there's a live action film version of the show being produced.
*Claim the the show is racist, anti-Semitic and/or misogynist.

==Copy Pasta==

The children of south Africa sat around their table that morning. Their body's full and their meat bulging. As a colossal bird sat in front of them.

Their father had returned home last night after making peaceful discussions with the guerrilla's leader. Odd considering he was demanding genocide of their entire tribe just a week ago.

In the middle East, Michale Rosenbaum and Ackmed Jiinana both went out for a drink, Taking in their customary jabs at one another in good fun and with good grace. For though they were both religious men, they knew that God and Heaven was big enough for both of them.

In China, The first laws regarding proper medical care for all of it's citizens was instigated. And the government handed over sovereignty to the people of the nation.

The final act was set at the United Nations, When all the world's leaders and all the world's men agreed to set aside their differences and see the world set in the right direction. All nuclear weapons, all guns and rifles, all weapons that could harm anyone were destroyed. And the people rejoiced for there was nothing left to fear.

_____________________________

In America. Two magical creatures and a young boy watched TV.

"So lemme get this right. Nobody thought to try and rid world hunger, instigate world peace or remove all disease and suffering? Even with an unlimited supply of magic powers?" the boy asked.

"Not really," the green haired one said.

[[Irony|"Damn. Kids are dicks,"]] the boy commented.
