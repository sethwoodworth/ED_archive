[[Image:MGWOTM.jpg|right|thumb|This is the sinister intent of all [[Christfags]] ]]

The '''Good Person Test''' (GPT), is a [[gimmick]] used by many [[Christfags]] to try and attempt conversion of a non-christfag into the flock. It was invented by [[Ray Comfort|Ray Cumfart]] of [http://www.livingwaters.com/ living waters ministry] who wanted to have a cookie-cutter type of [[faggotry| evangelism]] that could be done by even the simplest of [[retards]]. This is done by the use of questions that are so rigged that it makes pro-wrestling bookies green with envy. These questions are meant to steer you into their sales-pitch, and in giving up your individuality, your intelligence and believe in stupid shit like [[creationism]].

'''The Questions To Remember'''

''1. "Do You Think You're a Good Person?"''

''2. "Have you ever told a lie?"''

''3. "Have you ever taken anything that did not belong to you?"''

''4. "Have you ever looked at another person with lust or desire?"''

''5. "Have you ever been angry with another person?"''

''6. "Have you ever taken God's name in vain?"''

''7. "What happens when you die?"''

=== How to mess with a practitioner of that method===
It is possible to mess with [[Christfags]] who use such methods for maximum [[lulz]]. The key to this is to answer their questions with a question. This frustrates the [[Christfags]] who will try to bring you back to the topic of the conversation. Their sense of [[unwarranted self-importance]] will push them to want to have the last word.
