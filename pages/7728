Spectrophilia
[[File:Nutbusters.png|thumb|300px|''Nutbusters'' - [http://www.muffia.com/naked-movie/nut_busters/home.htm yes, there is porn of it].]]

Combining the two most popular topics on the internet - religious debates and sex - '''Spectrophilia''' is sex with ghosts. Ghost sex does not, as most people think, involve people dressing up in sheets with a vanishing dildo, but being molested by the spirit of someone who has died. Having little success with the living, spectrophilia is the chosen orientation of [[psychic]]s and [[otherkin]] enthusiasts while allowing them to remain [[technical virgin]]s.


==It is NOT [[Necrophilia]] - it is Inter-Paranormal Relationships!==

Both involving sex with the dead, ghost-fucking is automatically associated with corpse-fucking. Spectrophiliacs (or [[sick fuck|spec fucks]]) however adamantly deny that there is any connection between their fetish and necrophilia.

First, like animals and small children it is often it is the ghost - most likely the spirit of Ted Bundy - who makes the first move. Most ghosts prefer to masturbate their victims although others will throw them down and have full [[ass]]tral sex with them. Admittedly, it is difficult to imagine how it is possible to rape a ghost due to their terminal lack of body. For the same reason it's hard to imagine how a ghost can rape a human.

Second, spectrophilia is often preferable to necrophilia as dead bodies smell bad and are gross. They also tend to break apart and liquidate like soft cheese if pounded too hard. Specrophilia by contrast [[derp|is a deeply spiritual experience]].


===Subsections===
Since having imaginary sex with a corpse wasn't [[retarded]] or creepy enough there are several fetish extensions to add a little spice to an otherwise dead sex life:

*<big>Haunted Doll:</big><br />
:Remember Chucky from the ''Child's Play'' movies, or those scary-as-shit ventriloquist dolls? [[Rule 34|Somebody, somewhere is masturbating to them]].

*<big>Katoptronophilia</big><br />
:An unsurprisingly common fetish which involves [[fapping]] in front of the mirror in the hopes a ghost [[in the ass|will appear behind them]]. This <s>rarely</s> never happens and they have to settle for their own reflections. This is also [[Narcissistic personality disorder|known by another name]] or simply [[twincest]].

*<big>Paranormal / Spectral (prefix)</big>:<br />
:Any fetish - but with ghosts. Got a fetish about being pissed on, but by ghosts? ''Paranormal Urophilia''. [[Twilight|Do vampires make you wet]]? ''Paranormal Haematophilia''. Like masturbating to yourself in the mirror? ''Spectrophilia''. Fetishes such as these exist despite the fact that ghosts don't have cocks or cunts, cannot produce body fluids and, most importantly, are already dead. Yes, ''Paranormal Necrophilia'' is possible.


===Evidence===
*Having sexual fantasies of a loved one shortly after they have died. This sometimes includes the family pet.

*Many report having intense sexual feelings and even an [[orgasm]] despite the fact ''[[dying alone|nobody was with them]]''.

*Most spectrophiliacs experience ghost sex for the first time shortly after reading about it online. This suggests the ghost was reading over their shoulders and started getting ideas.

*Ghosts rarely masturbate people in public - except at cemeteries, funerals or during murder tours. They will however attack while at home, particularly if their victims are watching snuff movies.


Despite [[sarcasm|such compelling evidence]] concrete evidence for ghost sex is scant. If however you have ever mysteriously popped a boner at a funeral or woken up with the sheets all sticky you can be sure you have been visited by a paranormal pervert.

|Sudden through my clothes I felt something in my genital region. And the two hands still holding my shoulders to the bed forcibly. Then it moved against my penis slowly at first. I was in a panic now I started to yell but an unseen hand heavy and seeming very solid went over my mouth. I then realized that the pressure of what wad that of feeling like a large man was now on top of me and his ghostly penis was now diving in between my tightly closed legs.
The feelings stopped abruptly after about 20 minutes had gone by as I felt the heavy body collapse on top of me. And then abruptly it was gone. And I was shaken and shaking from this ghostly homosexual contact. The fear was that I was raped in essence by a very real unseen strong malicious force. I am not homophobic or was not even at that time in my life. But if to me forcible sexual contact with someone living or dead is not pleasant unless that's your personal fetish. At the time I personally asked the ghost to have sexual contact with me to see if the Harp's were telling me the truth of their haunted sexual experience's.|[[No homo|Isn't it great to have another man suck your cock and not be gay?]]

==SPECIAL MENTION: The Popobawa==
[[File:Popobawa.jpg|thumb|The dreaded one-eyed monster.]]

In the highly-reputed country of [[Africa]] residents believe they are under constant threat from the butt-raping bat-ghost, the [http://popobawa.net/ popobawa]. Its key features are its magical ability to [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1446733.stm suddenly appear during elections] and the curious habit of fucking men up the ass. This has lead many to conclude that despite the many people laughing at the silly darkies who believe in [[Twilight|vampire rapists]], the [[GNAA|Gay Nigger Association of Africa]] are showing the first signs of intelligence, as they have thought up a brilliant excuse as to why their assholes are all red and swollen.

The alternative is "[[rape|FUCK YOU]]! VOTE FOR ME!"
