'''Piotrus''' claims to be a [[geek]], [[otaku]], a [[weblog|net freelancer]], [[Mensa]] [[tool|member]], [[singularitarianism|Singularitarian]], [[Shit nobody cares about|Magister Artium]] in [[economy|economics]], and one of the top 100 [[fanboys|active editors]] of the [[wikipedia|SS Blowhard]]. He was an [[sysop]] from [[Last Thursday|back in the day]]. It was good to see that a [[bullshit|Magister Artium degree]] being accepted by an organization other than [[Scientology|CULT:CoS]].

Recently, Piotrus was betrayed and disgraced by his former [[Wikipedo]] comrades and his [[sysop]] rights removed. He now seeks revenge and has come to [[ED]] for aid. He began by revealing the [[secret]]s of the [[Wikipediametric]].

==Your Humble Servant==
[[File:ProkonsulPiotrus.png|thumb|Piotrus also administrates the [[EVE]] [[wiki]].]]

He displays the modesty that has become the [[Nevar|common]] trait of all [[sheep|dedicated Wikipedians]]. In keeping with the humble traditions, he adopted the name and self-appointed title of "Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus". This moniker comes complete with its own obnoxious user box/graphic thingy to ensure that his contributions [[attention whore|do not go unnoticed]].

It is also pointed out that the term Prokonsul Piotrus ''is not'' a diminutive (means tiny or wee), but is a Latinization (means deluded or [[cock|cocky]]). According to Freud, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar &ndash; but Piotrus always means dick. Throughout history, the term proconsul has meant that someone is [[All your base are belong to us|asserting authority over a place]] where they do not have any right to do so. The modern day translation in the [[poland|Polish]] language is 'buttinski'. Some prominent proconsul figures: Julius Caesar, who was stabbed repeatedly by his close friends, after he was named sysop of Rome. [[Donald Rumsfeld|This jerk-off]] is a more current proconsul, as he has now [[lie|declared victory]] in Iraq on several different occasions. 

==Tripe==
Piotrus offers a 9 part essay on how to [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/How_to_deal_with_Poles deal with Poles]. The article indicates that he does indeed have the ability required by [[Wikipedia|BS orgs]] to make even simple things overly complicated and [[unfunny|pretentious]]. There has been a simple [[Hitler|1 step method of dealing with Poles]] in place for the past 60 years.

A [[gay|salad-o-meter]] displays the [[The Darwin Awards|awards]] he has convinced others that he deserves. There is some fine print along the bottom of the image that is hard to read at first glance, but upon magnification, it is just a reminder that he cannot use syrup to toss a salad on holy days &ndash; but on those days, a kosher jelly will do fine as a substitute.

[[wikipedia:User:Piotrus/Bookshelf|The bookshelf link]] gives a list of [[not|supposedly]] rare books. A one-page cliff note books titled [[noone|Who the Fuck Cares]] is available and that sums up the entire library.

|Hi, [[Alison]]. Sad to say, I have been banned for 3 months despite all my hard work for the project. I would "go Grawp" on them like [[user:Bantustan|Bantustan]] suggested, however many of us are moving on to new accounts, especially the ones that are "retiring". Some of them may or may not be using proxies. They are being purposefully vague on the mailing list in fear that they will be outed again, but I do have a suspicion: do a CU on the wikipedometer.net IP range (do a DNS lookup), and see if anything comes up from that /20. If something does, it's most likely Digwuren. If something does indeed come up, please put in a good word for me when I appeal my desysoping.|Piotrus plots his comeback
