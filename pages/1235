Burn a Koran Day

{{quote|If violence happens in reaction to this, the violence was not caused by us, it has just been exposed.}}

'''Burn a Koran Day''' was the [[drama-generating technique|brainchild]] of a rabid Floridian [[Christfag]] and [[Troll]] pastor called Doctor [[Monty Python|Terry Jones]] set to coincide with the anniversary of [[9/11]] (which also happens to be the official end of [[Ramadan]] and Eid el Fitr aka Moslem Christmas Day). To [[IDIFTL|further facilitate teh lulz]], Mr Jones [http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/27216/dove-world-outreach-center-general-petraeus-and-everyone-else-speaks-out-against-quran-burning/ contracted with] a local [[KKK|armed militia]] called the “[http://www.rightwingextreme.us/index.php/about-rwe.html Right Wing Extreme]” to provide security -protecting the [[Nazis|book-burners]], keep things orderly and provide further [[lulz]], [[drama]] and [[Liberal]] butthurt.

The original event was scheduled to take place on the church grounds, but extreme media coverage has resulted in a national event. However on 9/9/2010 Jones became a [[pussy troll]] and announced that he would [[Pussy Troll|cancel]] his event because Imam Rauf Sharia was no longer going to extend his holy land to ground zero. However after Jones had made this announcement, Imam Rauf Sharia called the Reverend's bluff and said he had made no decision. The two are scheduled to battle on [[9/11]] in [[New York]] to [[cat fight|dispute]] the situation. And thus, the good Doctor will have attained his lifelong goal -and the real point of this whole affair- to get the fuck out of his hick town and go hang out with the [[Jews]] in [[Jew York City]].

According to the [[Failbook]] page for the event (which has over 14,000 members), on September 11th, 2010, from 6pm - 9pm, they were going to burn the [[Koran]] on the property of Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, FL in remembrance of the fallen victims of [[9/11]] and to stand against the evil of [[Islam]]. Islam is of the [[Devil]]! 

It should be noted that if the 24/7 newscycle hadn't jumped all over this hot potato like flies on the shit it is and ignored that [[batshit]] insane old coot, this would have pretty much gone unnoticed. 
=='Doctor' Terry Jones==
[[File:Islam-is-of-The-Devil-Front-Cover_0.jpg|thumb|left|Terry Jones' on why [[Christians]] are from Mars and [[Muslems]] are from Hades.]]
Terry Jones was born and raised in southeast Missouri and, incidentally, went to high school with [[Rush Limbaugh]]. [http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/09/who-knew-terry-jones-and-rush-limbaugh-were-high-school-classmates/1 Srsly]. Originally a Jew, Dr. Jones embraced [[Christianity]] after finding [[shota|how much fun you can have as a Christian]] during his 30 years in [[Europe]] as a [[rapist|missionary]]. Upon his return to Florida, Jones became a [[pedo|pastor]] for the Dove World Outreach Center, a church consisting of a whopping 50 families all of which are probably related. The church also contains a [[prison|boarding school]] in which the students are not allowed to do anything other than [[molest|worship Jesus]] or [[molest|hate Islam]].

Before his current mission for 15 Minutes of Fame, this Grade A [[attention whore]] once lorded over a church in Germany where he taxed the congregation like he was some kind of Xtian [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and was fond of telling his sheeple that old nugget of wisdom from [[Adolf Hitler]] that "[[slavery|arbecht macht frei]]" before [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1310602/Koran-burning-pastor-Terry-Jones-expelled-German-church.html?ito=feeds-newsxml getting banhammered] for being too [[EXTREME]]!


Dr. Jones is also a [[batshit crazy]] Braveheart fanatic (proof that batshit crazies stick together), and has Braveheart memorabilia in every room of his church.  The [http://www.youtube.com/user/BraveheartShow Youtube channel] Jones started is also named "The Braveheart Show".

In his [[not|best selling]] book [http://www.islamisofthedevil.com/ Islam is of the Devil] he writes:

*Why Islam is not a religion of peace but of violence ([[Faux News|he learned it from a reliable source]]).
*[[Holy_shit|How the political history of Islam can demonstrate what will happen in the future if it is allowed to flourish]]
*[[Gay|What you can do to take a stand for the truth and engage in the spiritual battle to reclaim nations from the grips of Islam]]

{{quote|God has given the body of Christ everything it needs to become an apostolic, overcoming church in America and around the world. But instead of mobilizing for the battle for truth, many Christians today are bowing to society. Mired in political correctness, the church remains ignorant about one of Satan's most successful, and most accepted attempts to counteract the truth of the gospel—Islam.|Terry Jones}}


===Ten Reasons To Burn The Koran===
{{bigpic|10_reasons.jpg|900|300|10 Reasons To Burn The Koran}}

Pastor Jones [http://islamisofthedevil.com/blog/2010/09/5-more-reasons-burn-koran goes on to provide 5 additional reasons]:
{{bigpic|BurnAKoran5MoreReasons.png|1100|350|5 Moar Reasons}}

But most rationally, just [[for the lulz|do it for the lulz]].


===Get Your Koran, For Free===

Just [http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=free+koran Google 'Free Koran']. Try and get a couple and then do as this [[Atheist|brave patriot]] did notice the southern accent:

'''Never pay actual money

===Other Ways to Burn a Koran===
[[File:Koranburncd.jpg|thumb]]
*Using a CD burner.
*[[Don't Copy That Floppy|Use it in place of foil whilst BBQ-ing roast pigs.]]
*Use the pages to roll a [[weed|spliff]].
*Stuff it inside a [[Irony|Terry Jones effigy]].

===Terry Jones Versus [[Irony]]===
*Terry Jones is the Christian equivalent of [[Richard Dawkins]].
*Everything in ''Islam is of the Devil'' is [[truth|true]].
*His protest has made people hate [[Christians]] more than [[Muslims]].

==Opposing Groups==
===The US Army===
Recently, Final Boss of [[US]] forces in [[Afghanistan]], General David Petraeus, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/09/07/2010-09-07_terry_jones_pastor_of_dove_world_outreach_center_will_go_through_with_koranburni.html spoke out against Burn a Koran Day], saying that this kind of bullshit could only serve to [[troll]] the Taliban  causing severe [[butthurt]] that would have further endangered the already tenuous welfare of his cannon fodder on the ground.

{{tinyquote|It could have endangered troops and it could have endangered the overall effort in Afghanistan. Were the  burning to have taken place, the safety of our soldiers and civilians would have been put in jeopardy and accomplishment of the mission would have been made more difficult.|Petræus}}

General Petræus, however, [[fail]]ed to notice that the Taliban generally get butthurt about anything and everything anyway.

In other news, Defense Undersecretary John Bottom made a personal call to Penelope Lane, 27, of Green Springs, Nevada, to protest that she had been seen [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1148363/Libraries-Bible-shelf-sop-Muslims.html placing the Koran on the second shelf] in the school library.  After some urgent protests, she agreed to keep the Koran on the top shelf, after the local Imam arranged to get her a higher stepstool and helped her cart away some older editions of the Linux Bible to make room.

===The Pope, [[John McRage]], Interpol, The US State Department, [[Hilldog]] and [[Black Jesus]]===
As pressure mounted, Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton finally [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20015869-503544.html got involved and issued a statement] skewering the pastor like a shish kebob hoping that it would take the pressure off the USA's [[terrorists|secret Moslem]] President Obama to come to the rescue of his real Holy Book. However, Hilldog's comedic turn didn't sufficiently assuage the butthurt and Obama was [http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-obama-koran-burning-20100910,0,1430372.story forced to weigh in on the situation], calling it a "[[epic win|recruiting bonanza for Al Qaeda]]".  This after condemnation from the Pope, John McCain, Secretary of Defence [[Bill Gates]]. Also, [[Interpol]] issued an international warning based on tips from [[oxymoron|Pakistani intelligence]] about possible repercussions and the US State Department issued an official warning for all Americans travelling overseas to pretend to be [[Canadian]].

===Bitching Bleeding-Heart Liberals===

Another group of [[butthurt]] [[Americunts]] are the [[Communists|liberalfags]] complaining that burning a religious book about [[Arab|Islam]] is [[racist]]... even though Islam is a religion, not a race.

However it's important to note not everybody opposing '''Burn a Koran Day''' is a [[raghead]] or inflicted with [[liberal guilt]] - some just really, really hate [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|Jews]].

==Supporting Groups==
===Conservative Rednecks===
Continuing the [[Christian]] tradition of burning books that aren't the Bible, inhabitants of [[Florida|America's wang]] would have been cooking s'mores over [[Muhammad]] to celebrate the religious freedom of the [[USA]]. Down with Arab "religion"! Up with [[Oxymoron|religious freedom]]!

===[[Internet Tough Guy]]s===
[[Amazon.com]] and [[Google]] are all in favour of the book-burning because they despise the printing press and have been working tirelessly to destroy ink and paper book in their relentless [[crusade]] to digitise fucking everything.

==The Lulz End==

[[File:Double Koran.jpg|thumb|left|Two minutes of American entertainment]]

As of [[Last Thursday|September 9, 2010]], in a classic case of [[Troll's Remorse|troll's remorse]], [[Pussy Troll|Jones]] has backed down. He has not stood his ground. Instead, he will be traveling to [[New York]] on Saturday to meet with the Mosque's organizers. 

According to a [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11255366 BBC News Article], he has agreed to not [[Lollercaust|burn]] the [[Mein Kampf|Koran]] because the [[Ground Zero Mosque]] is [[lies|being moved]]. The Jew have stated, however, that they have [[Trolls Trolling Trolls|no plan to move it]]. During a press conference ([[Dumbass|apparently he hasn't heard]] the Mosque isn't going to be moved after all), he stated "[[Lies|We would right now ask no one to burn Korans]]. We are absolutely strong on that. It is not the [[time]] to do it." See, the confusion arose because the local Imam who offered to act as a go-between (and went on TV to announce that the Ground Zero Mosque would move) was not actually authorised to do so and was trying to [[attention whore|grab himself some TV face-time]]. 

Meanwhile [[Donald Trump]] has jumped on the bandwagon by [http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2010/09/09/donald-trump-inserts-himself-into-mosque-controversy/ offering to buy the property] where the [[Ground Zero Mosque]] is slated to be built. And [[God hates fags|Westboro Baptist Church]] has [http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/20100907_WBC-to-Burn-the-Koran.pdf stated] that they will continue to burn the Koran on the set date... [[Irony|while carrying "GOD HATES AMERICA" signs]].  

You know, it's pretty fuckin' pathetic when America has to rely on ''[[Fred Phelps]]'' to show the world that [[Americunts|we]]'re [[irony|not all a bunch of pussies]].  Maybe the media will let Muslims worldwide know that we've allowed Phelps to run around for the past thirty years picketing the funerals of our own soldiers, picketing where the president's kids go to school, and generally making an ass out of himself.  At which point they might get an inkling of the whole freedom of speech thing, and have to go celebrate by blowing up themselves and fellow Muslims, with great victory.

<center>Unlike pedophile prophet-lover Terry Jones, WBC never [[God hates fags|fags]] out. For balance, they also burnt the doomed fag flag of the USA besides the unholy Quran.</center>

==[[Disregard That]]; A [[Koran Man|master troll, a hero and absolute legend]] has saved the day ==
[[File:HATERS-GONNA-HATE quranman koranman.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Koran Man]] approaches...]]

[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11256182 Pastor Jones has now said that the book-burning is now on hold rather than cancelled.] The crazy old coot says [[oh noes|he was lied to]]. He had spent days waiting for a [[NO U|sign from God]] to cancel the protest, and that the sign had come in the form of a deal with a local Imam to relocate a controversial Islamic cultural centre due to be built near Ground Zero in New York. However, since the local Imam had no juice in the matter, he's reneging on the deal.

{{tinyquote|Given what we are now hearing, we are forced to rethink our decision. So as of right now, we are not cancelling the event, but we are suspending it.|Jones}}

In addition, the [[Party Van]] has paid several visits to Pastor Jones over the last few days.

Even though Pastor Terry Jones backed out of burning the Koran, someone claiming to be inspired him has burned one at [[Ground Zero]].

This [[Islam|Koran]] burner was later identified and got [[Banned|fired]] from his [[New Jersey|New Jersey Transit]] job.


Two other reverends in Tennessee have also carried out what Terry Jones couldn't bring himself to do.

Geordie chavs show how it's done. They got v&. 

Shockingly, these men were arrested, even though THEY BROKE NO LAW. Northumbria Police arrested them on the grounds of inciting racial hatred, not realising that Islam is NOT a race. No wonder that hero [[Raoul Moat]] hated them.

Northumbria police are very wrong about racism. Islam is﻿ not a race. It's just fucking ink on paper. By arresting them, they have drawn massive media attention.
