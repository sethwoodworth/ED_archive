Arkansas Sports Talk.net, otherwise known as the Island of Misfit Toys and Arkansas' own bastion of wanton [[faggotry]], is a [[Circle_jerk|message board]] populated by known [[Child_molester|ex-Woopig.net posters]], [[Douchebag|35 year old men]] still living in their parents' basement, and known wanton [[faggots]].  After only a few months in existance, the site is already dying.  How surprising.

== History ==

Almost [[100 years ago]], a [[Faggot_icon|disgruntled member]] of some other website decided to run things his way, and he started his own board, which came to be known as AST .  Not long after, it exploded to a massive count of 1500 members, half of those registered by the [[Fuckwit|board owner]] to jack their numbers up, the other half known rejects.

Frequent topics by [[Anonymous_pussies|members]] include Hogville, [[Furry_love|hobbies]] that many of AST enjoy, Hogville, offline [[NAMBLA|club memberships]], and Hogville, and lying, whining, and crying like [[pussies]] about how Hogville banned them when they, in truth, deserved it.  [http://arsportstalk.net/smf/index.php/topic,728.0.html A lot of that] goes on these days.

'''Lojinx''' - The same Basstun [[Shemale|tech dude]] that was ran off from [[Woopig.net]] for cocksucking rampage   Has big mouth online, but wouldn't smart off to an eight year old in person.  Lojinx keeps faux photos of other websites' admins on his hard drive.  Very creepy, but par for the course being that he's a 35'ish year old [[virgin]].

'''[[Fucktard|Hoggysoprano aka Skip]]''' - Stunted little [[motherfucker]] with a smart mouth.  Can kick anyone's [[ass]], anywhere, but prefers his [[Furggotry|brawls]] on a state line or at a Sonic.  Has had [[Buttsecks|cordial relations]] with your wife.  Has a gut the size of a snare drum from drinking Milwaukee's Beast.  Enjoys jacking off bulldogs in his spare time.

[[Image:Idiot.jpg|thumb|Skip on his day job.]]

'''Beatnikluv''' - [[Bitchdyke|Lady]] that thinks the world revolves around her, with [[Fugly|looks]] that could scare the [[shit]] out of [[Hillary Clinton]].  Is [[Head|very talented]].  Ask her sometime why she's one of the handful of their mods and admins that are asking in privateto be let back on Hogville.

'''[[Cum_slut|Swahili Steve]]''' - Has set the world record for being many different types of [[whore]], from [[attention whore]], to [[drama whore]], as well as [[comment whore]], to the plain old run of the mill whore.  Take a step back, guys.  There's no tread left on those [[Vagina|tires]].  It's more now like trying to throw a [[Penis|hot dog]] down a hallway.  Is sweet on some poster named Razorwire.  Run for the hills, Razorwire, unless you want to [[STD|end up taking penicillin]] for the rest of your life.  Swahili Steve is known for being a [[snake]] lover.

'''NJHawgFan and Esteshog''' - Not much is known about these [[Pansexual|two]].  However, they are the Terrance and Philip of AST, only on a slightly more [[Twinks|disturbing level]].  Estes has a known [[Psychopath|rage problem]] over the internets, which is classic irony considering [[Dork|he was picked on]] by bullies in school and never recovered from it.  NJ, who is a [[Moron]], has now shown his own psychopathic tendencies by stalking ex-wives of former AST members.

'''porkrindjimmy''' - The Pied Piper of [[Bullshit]].  Has a semi-large [[cult]] following that would willingly [[Suicide|off]] themselves themselves if PRJ told them to.

Loves creating fake [[MySpace]] pages to [[stalk]] people. Has [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=169450836 his own Myspace page]. 

'''The Whyte Boar''' - Perfect example of what was said earlier on this page about reject posters who whine about their rightful [[ban]]s. All this guy does is whine. The Whyte Boar is in extreme opposition to the state's proposed animal cruelty laws, because it would end [[Beastiality|his favorite hobby]].

== The Future of AST ==

Being that Arkansas Sports Talk is a perfect definition of what a [[Nazi]] board is, and taking into consideration that the whole "I was unfairly [[banned]], let me show my rage over the internets" [[Bullshit|bit]] is getting old, the future of that site is not a bright one.  The [[Adolf_Hitler|board owner]] has already had to deal with and make a futile attempt to curtail the endless rumor-mongering and slander that is spread on there on a daily basis, so it's a safe bet to say that sooner before later, a defamation [[lawsuit]] will be filed against them.  

When that happens, AST will fade away, appropriately like a popcorn fart in a hailstorm.  Lawsuit or not - it already is, from looking at their declining registration figures.  

It's not like nobody can't see it coming, whether it be from a lawsuit, disgusting potential members from the rampant wanton faggotry, or being [[dumb]] enough to start a board [[war]] that will end with their loss.  Several of their mods and admins are already asking, in private, to be let back onto the board that AST rages against.  So, the rats are already jumping off that sinking ship.  Can't say that we blame them.


== Latest Drama ==

'''Skip vs Everyone'''

About 100 years ago, [[Attention_whore|Skip]], author of the now famous Nigger Manual, claimed to have undeniable proof that a certain coach went [[In_the_ass|stepping out]] with some [[16_year_old_girls|lady]], and says he will post proof of it at 9 am March 20, for all the [[lulz]].  That is like, so [[2007]].

The first question is, how does he have [[pictures]] of them in the first place?  Omitting the obvious reason, of course, that he's gone back to his [[Stalker|former profession]].

9 am comes and goes, no proof.  Some [[Cult|people]] that had formerly believed [[everything]] he had to say were now questioning his [[Nothing|credibility]].

Skip, being Skip, flies off into a [[rage]] with his [[IMMA_CHARGIN_MAH_LAZER|usual threats]] and poor [[Bash|smack]], as evidenced by the following:

[[Image:Skipmeltdown3.jpg]]
[[Image:Skipmeltdown2.jpg]]
[[Image:Skipmeltdown.jpg]]

How will the [[psychopath]] come up with something he doesn't have?  Have the [[sheep]] finally gotten wise?  Will there be heads [[photoshop]]ped on [[pr0n]]?  Will board owner [[Mecha-Hitler]] pull a deus ex machina?  Tune in next time...

Next time - '''Still''' no photos.  Skip is now [[bullshit|claiming]] that he was contacted by a lawyer.

When he finally posts it, it is so going to be heads pasted on pr0n done in MS Paint.

Even later than next time - Again, no photos.  Where all the white women at?

== Latest-er Drama ==

{{rainbowpyramid|OH NOES BOARD WAR LOL!!!111}}
<BR>
<BR>
The split on AST that was predicted [[100 years ago]] for the summer of [[2007]] finally came early.  Several [[Nazi]] admins and [[Sanjaya]]  pushed several posters too far with their lame quest for the lulz, and they left and started their own board, but not before firing the first shots in a new [[Cat_fight|board war]].  

It's like [[Christmas]].

AST began because several members got mad because rumors were moved to a new rumors forum.  Later, they ended up alienating some of their members because they moved [[Santorum|rumors]] to a rumor forum.  Thus, a new equation has been born.

Evil Nazi admins * AST (hypocrisy) + disgrunted members = New board (Death of AST).

In the words of their illustrious board poison, [[Fag|Jack Boar]]: ROFLoL!!!1 AST you been [[own3d]]!!

== Unanswered Questions ==

- If the new board that split from AST is indeed its sister site, as [[Stalin|Sal]], the mighty [[cock]]-handler asserts, why isn't there a link to it on the main page?

[[Image:links.jpg]]

''Could it be that there are not tidings of goodwill and joy from AST to its newly-spawned child?''

- If AST is indeed thriving, then why are their post numbers and number of new topics in a three month decline?

- Why did so many people jump ship to the new site from AST, including Robo-Stalin?

- When will the majority of AST posters who were banned from another site finally tell the truth about their bans?

- Will the new board become AST-lite and follow the same doomed path to failure as AST is?

- Will Sal ever get over his rampant case of [http://arsportstalk.net/smf/index.php/topic,13674.0.html penis envy]?
