Pastede on
{{crap}}


[[Image:Dominic3.jpg|thumb|His hed iz pastede on YEY!]]
Used to refer to something unbearably stupid or ludicrous, usually in the form of "{object of scorn} iz pastede on yey!"  (The deliberate misspellings are half the point of the joke.)

== Origins ==
This initially spawned from the [[JournalFen]]-based [[FandomWank]] community, which exists to mock the idiocy in [[fandom]]s. The story goes that ''Lord of the Rings'' [[fangirl]] [http://www.livejournal.com/users/crystalgamgee/ Crystal Gamgee] knew the actors of the LotR movies well enough to get them to pose for sketches - sketches which were forgeries using borrowed photos and obvious [[Photoshop]] filters - when in reality, Crystal was just another shitty artist and fantard that nobody important knows, similar to you. While caught up in defending her [[Lie|lies]], she displayed an obvious [[photomanip]] (pictured to the right) of actor [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0597480/ Dominic Monaghan] supposedly lying on her bed. In the process, "My hed iz pastede on yay!" was first used by Crystal herself to display her own lack of credibility, [[skillz]], and intelligence.  "Yay" in the original has mutated into "yey" in later use.
