[15:07] * JB_Wook13 /facepalms
[15:07] <ZalbaarWk> I find that offensive to my fursona. we came here looking for likeminded individuals, and we've just been met with prejudice
[15:08] <Jenifur> yes
[15:08] <JB_Wook13> it's tards like this that give us guys trying to actually get in touch with our inner fursona
[15:08] <JB_Wook13> In fact
[15:08] <JB_Wook13> I feel like somewhat of a pioneer
[15:08] <Jenifur> this channel *IS* predjudicial towards trolls
[15:08] <ZalbaarWk> i am a wookie! not a troll :(

[15:09] <JB_Wook13> After I was told that wookies were indeed a possibility for a fursona
[15:09] <JB_Wook13> especially for the reasons I decided to get in touch with my inner wookie
[15:10] <JB_Wook13> My last name is Baca
[15:10] <JB_Wook13> I'm really furry IRL
[15:10] <JB_Wook13> due to being spanish
[15:10] <JB_Wook13> and italian
[15:10] <ZalbaarWk> lol, that's cool :D
[15:10] <JB_Wook13> and I'm 6'3"
[15:10] <JB_Wook13> There was no other logical choice
[15:10] <ZalbaarWk> i don't have a cool surname like that :(

[15:11] <ZalbaarWk> i find the phrase "walking carpet" offensive tho. what if I called someone in this channel a "walking coat" or something? :(
[15:11] <JB_Wook13> well
[15:11] <JB_Wook13> PETA does that to furries
[15:12] <JB_Wook13> it's really messed up
[15:12] <JB_Wook13> IMO PETA is a terrorist organization
[15:12] <JB_Wook13> a wolf in sheep's clothing if I may
[15:12] * Mercutio wows at this awesome example of bad parenting. They gave the little girl ecstasy. http://www.deletedyoutube.ftvteen.com/?v=xG33EnK29R4

[15:13] * TaoChakat pirrups? =^^=
[15:13] <MaxIssaSadBunny> What does PETA have on furries? They're morons without a single redeeming quality, but I didn't think they gave a shit about furries.
[15:13] <JB_Wook13> they do
[15:13] <JB_Wook13> Well
[15:13] <JB_Wook13> Some of them
[15:13] <ZalbaarWk> they have a lot of furries in the organisation i think
[15:13] <JB_Wook13> the ones that wear fursuits and whatnot
[15:14] <JB_Wook13> I remember hearing about some condemnation of them because it represents bad things
[15:14] <JB_Wook13> it's mocking the plight of certain animals I think it was
[15:14] <JB_Wook13> they called it a joke
[15:14] <JB_Wook13> I read about it a while ago
[15:14] <JB_Wook13> and kind of brushed it aside
[15:15] <MaxIssaSadBunny> We make animal costumes out of synthetic fabrics, because we like animals. Hmm.
[15:15] <JB_Wook13> yeah
[15:15] <JB_Wook13> well, these are the guys that claim to save animals
[15:16] <JB_Wook13> and then go take strays an euthanize them
[15:16] <MaxIssaSadBunny> If they insist on deceiving themselves, what the fuck are we going to do about it?
[15:16] <JB_Wook13> I dunno, it's like the KKK really
[15:16] <JB_Wook13> what if they start reaching out and touching people
[15:16] <Kittiah> Fuck PETA :P
[15:16] <MaxIssaSadBunny> They get their arms broken.
[15:16] <JB_Wook13> if anyone would do it, I think ALF and PETA would be the IRL fursecutors
[15:16] <Kittiah> right idea, wrong execution
[15:17] <Kittiah> JB, that is an abboration of a compund word, take it back immediatley X.x
[15:17] <Kittiah> *compound
[15:17] <JB_Wook13> lol, sorry
[15:17] <JB_Wook13> I read it
[15:17] <JB_Wook13> and thought it was fitting
[15:17] <JB_Wook13> I take it back
[15:17] <Kittiah> Thank you :)
[15:17] <JB_Wook13> they are persecuting the furries
[15:17] <Kittiah> Well, I dont feel paticularly persecuted
[15:18] <Rocky> PETA and Greenpeace are very much alike.. Good basic idea, but has attracted too many nutcases.
[15:18] <Leik> o.O 
[15:18] <JB_Wook13> yeah
[15:18] <Leik> Crocodiles help turtles to the water o.O 
[15:18] <JB_Wook13> and nutcases have a bad habit of not keeping hands to themselves
[15:18] * TaoChakat hopes shi doesn't class as one of the Greenpeace nutcases. =\
[15:18] <MaxIssaSadBunny> Rocky: Not exactly.
[15:19] <Leik>  TaoChakat, you're the 'Green' part of Greenpeace :P
[15:19] <Rocky> *snickers*
[15:19] <MaxIssaSadBunny> TaoChakat: As long as you don't consider humans more expendable than wild animals, I wouldn't.
[15:19] <TaoChakat> Leik, my friend, you are silly. X3
[15:19] <Leik>  Danke sehn :>
[15:19] <MaxIssaSadBunny> Oh, I like that Leik. Hehe.
[15:19] <MaxIssaSadBunny> Green and peaceful are both great.
[15:19] <JB_Wook13> you know what would stink
[15:19] <TaoChakat> MaxIssaSadBunny: No I don't.
[15:20] <JB_Wook13> if our world got destroyed by some uncontrollable force
[15:20] <JB_Wook13> and all of our conservation was in naught
[15:20] <Kittiah> ...yeah, that would kinda suck

[15:20] <Jenifur> that process is already in progress
[15:20] <Mercutio> You've convinced me, time to eat all the endangered species while I still can.

[15:20] <DracoSilverscar> sure i'm gonna die but i'm gonna hotwire a car and go joyriding first!
[15:20] <TaoChakat> I don't think it'd suck if the world got destroyed... cuz we wouldn't be around to label it as 'suck' ... =\

[15:21] * Erik_Tategami_ (~Erik_Tate@fur-62891D7.hsd1.mn.comcast.net) has joined #softpaws
[15:21] <DracoSilverscar> well by technicality almost every force that COULD destroy the would would be more accurately labeled as "blow" than "suck" because almost all of them are something expanding or impacting
[15:22] <JB_Wook13> well.
[15:22] <JB_Wook13> I don't mean as a planetary destroyer
[15:22] <JB_Wook13> I mean
[15:22] <JB_Wook13> like a volcano goes off
[15:22] <DracoSilverscar> still blowing ;p
[15:22] <JB_Wook13> ah.
[15:22] * Erik_Tategami (~Erik_Tate@fur-3FD5D126.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout�)
[15:22] <DracoSilverscar> just thats molten lava being blown into the atmosphere
[15:22] <MaxIssaSadBunny> A burst of gamma radiation from a supernova would incinerate everything on one side of the planet in an instant and render the atmosphere all over the planet unusable soon thereafter.
[15:23] * Erik_Tategami_ is now known as Erik_Tategami
[15:23] <DracoSilverscar> that would be nasty o..o

[15:24] <Leik> What if NA was the side that was wiped out? 
[15:24] <Kittiah> Why Seattle?
[15:24] <JB_Wook13> seattle has delicious coffee.
[15:24] <MaxIssaSadBunny> I'm speaking of a very large star, at least 50 solar masses, within the Milky Way.
[15:25] <DracoSilverscar> what about nova scotia? nothing out of the ordinary happens to us. we'll be last to be destroyed even the hurricanes avoid us
[15:25] <Kittiah> If tis gonna be an orgy to end all orgys and the world is gonna get destroyed, then surely you want somewhere breathtakingly picturesque to fuck your last moments away?

[15:53] <JB_Wook13> one of the kids

[15:54] <JB_Wook13> for telling them not to play in the street

[15:55] <JB_Wook13> he saw them hangin out in front of my house once
[15:55] <ZalbaarWk> i went to school with an african princess
[15:55] <ZalbaarWk> she was such a bitch

[15:57] <ZalbaarWk> but niggers are a different species all together. like, you can get white niggers too
[15:57] <JB_Wook13> gangstas should be given their own island
[15:57] <JB_Wook13> like australia
[15:57] <JB_Wook13> except
[15:57] <JB_Wook13> once we got them all there
[15:57] <Dsan> has it ever been taken into consideration that not all black people are into gangsta culture?

[15:57] <ZalbaarWk> australizzila
[15:57] <JB_Wook13> I know this
[15:57] <JB_Wook13> that's why I said black people vs niggers
[15:57] <rfm> man, buncha racists in this channel
[15:57] <ZalbaarWk> ya
[15:57] <JB_Wook13> niggers are the guys that do drivebys
[15:57] <archmapping> ...
[15:57] <Alvain> Heh, I'm from a Section 8 Housing project in Dallas, Texas... I'm not raciest, I'd have been shot to death if I was.... oddly, despite most fo their grandparents being really racist, most of my black friends in texas didn't care that I was white as a sheet.
[15:58] <Dsan> is there a real difference?
[15:58] <ZalbaarWk> oprah winfery is a black person
[15:58] <JB_Wook13> black people are the people you and I are just like
[15:58] <ZalbaarWk> 50 cent in a nigger
[15:58] <ZalbaarWk> case in point really
[15:58] <Alvain> Now that I live in small town wisconsin I'm amazed at people around here.
[15:58] <JB_Wook13> yeah
[15:58] <rfm> What did 50 cent do to deserve that title.
[15:58] <ZalbaarWk> he looks like a greased up slave ready for auction without all his bling
[15:58] <JB_Wook13> claim he was super hardcore for getting shot
[15:58] <JB_Wook13> well
[15:58] <JB_Wook13> not just that
[15:58] <JB_Wook13> his actions
[15:59] <ZalbaarWk> and he's another jumped up super-gangsta
[15:59] <JB_Wook13> he raps about the thug life and shit
[15:59] <Alvain> Went on a class field trip to Washington DC and all the kids here were afraid to order from the black waiter.... I think that's a form of racism that's almost as bad as open calling of names.
[15:59] <ZalbaarWk> niggers give black people a bad name :(
[15:59] <ZalbaarWk> Alvain: that's mean
[15:59] <JB_Wook13> that psuedo soldier mentality is what is causing so many problems these days
[15:59] <Alvain> Complete ignorce.
[15:59] <ZalbaarWk> but its because of niggers that black people are up against such racism
[15:59] <Alvain> ignorence*
[15:59] <JB_Wook13> agreed.
[15:59] <rfm> Wasn't 50 cent's first song about how he wasn't a gangsta
[16:00] <rfm> and how he hates people who call themselves that
[16:00] <Alvain> Also, I've beens hot, fuck 50 cent.
[16:00] <JB_Wook13> However
[16:00] <januszeal> rfm: he isnt doing a good job showing that
[16:00] <JB_Wook13> despite the differences between niggers and black people
[16:00] <JB_Wook13> I can't help but notice
[16:00] <Alvain> been shot*
[16:00] <Dsan> oh well, carry on, I just as well find this entertaining.
[16:00] <JB_Wook13> every black person I've ever hung out with
[16:00] <JB_Wook13> including my best friend dennis
[16:00] <JB_Wook13> they all like watermelon in a supernatural way.
[16:00] <rfm> There's a difference between being consciously racist and subconsciously racist
[16:00] <JB_Wook13> don't get me wrong
[16:01] <JB_Wook13> I like me some watermelon
[16:01] <JB_Wook13> but Dennis could eat an entire watermelon like for breakfast
[16:01] <ZalbaarWk> stereotypes are there 'cos they are true :D
[16:01] <Alvain> yes, I don't see how this is wrong?
[16:01] <JB_Wook13> It's not
[16:01] <JB_Wook13> It was jsut an observation
[16:01] <rfm> stereotypes are there because they're widely thought to be true
[16:01] <ZalbaarWk> just like the lazy mexican or the covetous jew
[16:01] <JB_Wook13> well
[16:01] <Alvain> ....
[16:02] <JB_Wook13> mexicans are NOT lazy
[16:02] * Alvain laughs.
[16:02] <JB_Wook13> I live in Arizona
[16:02] <Alvain> I don't know anyone in my family that's lazy/
[16:02] <rfm> you've been shot, alvain?
[16:02] <ZalbaarWk> i've been friends with a few mexicans and they were damn lazy
[16:02] <JB_Wook13> and we have like the fastest development of any state
[16:02] <ZalbaarWk> like, they'd just sleep in class all day and stuff
[16:02] <JB_Wook13> well
[16:02] <Alvain> Note: Half mexican, 1/4 native american, 1/4 irhs.

[16:03] <JB_Wook13> one race I personally never understood
[16:03] <JB_Wook13> was the jews
[16:03] <JB_Wook13> only religion with their own turf that was "given" to them
[16:03] <ZalbaarWk> are they even a race? like, christians or muslims aren't a race
[16:03] <Dsan> er, what is there to understand?
[16:03] <JB_Wook13> WHY
[16:03] <JB_Wook13> are they a race
[16:03] <Alvain> I'm a fucked up combanation though, I should be drunk constantly. Heh, Irish, mexican, native american.
[16:03] <Id> Yeah really

[16:04] <Alvain> Five.
[16:04] <JB_Wook13> no no no
[16:04] <JB_Wook13> My question is this
[16:04] <JB_Wook13> jews are not a race
[16:04] <rfm> Judaism is a religion centered around a race
[16:04] <JB_Wook13> which race?
[16:04] <MachWolf> waaark!
[16:04] <rfm> well uh, there isn't exactly a scientific definition of "race" man
[16:04] <Alvain> Smallest generates 2.7 million dollars a day, largest generates 5.7.
[16:04] <rfm> it's a social construct
[16:04] <JB_Wook13> give me a locale
[16:04] <ZalbaarWk> so if i converted to Judaism, i'm not really a jew?
[16:05] <Alvain> This is why I have free college, free medical, and also get 15,000 dollars a year for being alive.
[16:05] <Alvain> Because we own casinos.
[16:05] * Alvain shrugs.
[16:05] * Kittiah_ is now known as Kittiah
[16:05] <ZalbaarWk> Alvain: its a conspiracy! :P
[16:05] <JB_Wook13> rfm... seriously
[16:05] <rfm> hold on a second here
[16:05] <JB_Wook13> ok

[16:06] * Draegan (~noemail@c-24-8-88-140.hsd1.co.comcast.net) has joined #softpaws
[16:06] <ZalbaarWk> that's a lot of money
[16:06] <rfm> because it's similar to "Jewish", without the religious connotation
[16:06] <ZalbaarWk> are you going to put it to a reserve?
[16:06] <Alvain> My native american tribe is one of the few that... you know, gives basically everything back to their people.
[16:06] <JB_Wook13> that's far too vague. Israel has been a conflicted nation for centuries
[16:07] <JB_Wook13> ask the paki's
[16:07] <Alvain> I'm going to buy another house.
[16:07] * Alvain shrugs.
[16:07] * MachWolf licks Alvain
[16:07] <JB_Wook13> jews are like a forced society
[16:07] <ZalbaarWk> Alvain: what about your brothers?
[16:07] <JB_Wook13> nobody really has to acknowledge that term
[16:07] <Alvain> I have one.
[16:07] <rfm> israel has only been a nation at all for half a century
[16:07] <Alvain> He's going to do the same.
[16:07] <JB_Wook13> right
[16:07] <JB_Wook13> a jewish nation
[16:07] <JB_Wook13> but
[16:08] <archmapping> :o
[16:08] <JB_Wook13> it's not even fully recognized by the likes of saudi arabia
[16:08] <rfm> I mean it's conflicted because it's considered holy land by three different religions
[16:08] <rfm> so?
[16:08] <JB_Wook13> and religion is a major deciding factor in society right?
[16:08] <rfm> Nation isn't recognized by someone who hates them, big whoop
[16:08] * archmapping hates religion
[16:08] <JB_Wook13> so if it's divided 3 ways, how can you hand the social title to one?
[16:08] * rfm hates /organized/ religion
[16:08] <Alvain> Come on everybody take a trip with me. Down to mississippi, down to New Orleans. They got honey suckle growing on the honey suckle vines and love is blooming there all of the time.
[16:08] <ZalbaarWk> archmapping: are you atheist then?
[16:08] <archmapping> actually
[16:08] <JB_Wook13> especially when WE gave them jews the land?
[16:08] * archmapping is more with rfm
[16:09] <archmapping> I hate organized religions
[16:09] <Alvain> Why the hell is Mach licking me?
[16:09] <ZalbaarWk> so do you believe in god?
[16:09] <archmapping> because he is a furry and furries do things like that
[16:09] <MachWolf> i....dont......know?
[16:09] * Dsan waits for the next great UFO religion. :)
[16:09] <JB_Wook13> jews were a social class before they had their own land
[16:09] <JB_Wook13> a la the holocaust
[16:09] <archmapping> I suppose so, ZalbaarWk.   But I don't any sort of religious activity at -all-, really.
[16:09] <JB_Wook13> even hitler recognized them
[16:10] <JB_Wook13> hell, Germany will arrest you these days for mentioning the holocaust out of respect for the jews
[16:10] <archmapping> I'm more apathetic to the whole thing.
[16:10] <rfm> Uh
[16:10] <rfm> no
[16:10] <rfm> they'll arrest you for denying the holocaust
[16:10] <rfm> but you can mention it all you want
[16:10] <JB_Wook13> not really.
[16:10] <ZalbaarWk> archmapping: that's good. atheists are as bad as the most religious of people
[16:10] <JB_Wook13> I have a friend that lives there
[16:10] <ZalbaarWk> like, they're always out to "convert" others to nonbelief and stuff
[16:11] <JB_Wook13> but anyways
[16:11] <JB_Wook13> this is al lregardless to my main point
[16:11] <archmapping> I don't mind atheists as long as they're not all outward about it, as I don't really mind any other religion that isn't out trying to fucking convert people.
[16:11] <JB_Wook13> why the hell do they deserve to be the only religion that was given it's own land
[16:11] <MachWolf> i dunno, im a nonbeliever, but i dont try to convert others :3
[16:11] <rfm> What
[16:11] <ZalbaarWk> that's good
[16:11] <JB_Wook13> and to change the social status of EVERYONE who lives there to jews
[16:11] <rfm> o.o
[16:11] <rfm> Okay, Israel was founded for the jewish people, not the jewish religion
[16:11] <archmapping> I'm somewhere between "There is a god.", "I don't care.", and "Prove it to me."
[16:12] <JB_Wook13> and what makes them jewish?
[16:12] <archmapping> I seriously have better things to worry about than religion. :>
[16:12] <januszeal> JB_Wook13: their noses?
[16:12] <rfm> The ability to trace their lineage to a certain ancient semitic tribe
[16:12] <JB_Wook13> so you are saying that I can call myself nordic
[16:13] <JB_Wook13> because I can trace my roots 5000 years back?
[16:13] <JB_Wook13> and because of it
[16:13] <JB_Wook13> people should run around calling me a nord?
[16:13] <JB_Wook13> that's ridiculous
[16:13] <ZalbaarWk> that means we're all black really, if evolution is to be believed
[16:13] <rfm> Strawman argument
[16:13] <rfm> The reason that that is what "Jewish" means is because that's how it's used
[16:14] <JB_Wook13> lies. ask zalbaar what he uses jewish for
[16:14] * rfm rolls his eyes
[16:14] <rfm> commonly used
[16:14] * archmapping listens to music
[16:14] <JB_Wook13> it's regionally a term used for a religion
[16:14] <JB_Wook13> and there it's ALSO used for religion
[16:14] <archmapping> Tomahawk - Flashback <-- awesome band
[16:14] * MachWolf steals archmapping and runs off laughing maniacly
[16:14] <JB_Wook13> israelis calls themselves israelis
[16:14] <ZalbaarWk> but its like niggers. people can be huge jews without being jewish at all
[16:15] <JB_Wook13> despite their NATIONAL RELIGION
[16:15] <rfm> Actually people are trying to use the term "Judaist" for people who follow the religion

[16:15] <ZalbaarWk> yes
[16:15] <JB_Wook13> debate over
[16:15] <JB_Wook13> anyways
[16:15] <rfm> go back to gbs
[16:16] <archmapping> lol JB wins
[16:16] <ZalbaarWk> its common knowledge

[16:16] <ZalbaarWk> snooker's fucking gay
[16:16] <JB_Wook13> my point is "jews" should not get their own nation because Scientologists shouldn't get their own nation.

[16:18] <JB_Wook13> that's because the land was given to the jews, even if jews don't necessarily inhabit it
[16:18] <JB_Wook13> therefore, it should be stripped from the jews and given to the people!

[16:19] <Draegan> Hue: save me from the furries.
[16:19] <JB_Wook13> why? I don't know.
[16:19] <Alvain> I'm just saying I don't care if balls touch.
[16:19] <HuehueCoyotl> Draegan, smoke pot and let that alienate you from the crowd
[16:19] <rfm> JB_Wook13: Okay, so here's the problem which needs a solution: If there is no jewish country, where can jews go so that they don't have to worry about ever being oppressed?
[16:19] * BlakDrgn (~_@m055e36d0.tmodns.net) has joined #softpaws
[16:19] <ZalbaarWk> ok. its just been a common identifier over whether something is gay or not. like, somebody tell me what i'm wearing is gay and i'm like, nu-uh, balls aren't touching!
[16:19] <JB_Wook13> rfm: easy. America.
[16:20] <Leik> lololol 
[16:20] <Draegan> Hue: but some of them are too socially inept to care.
[16:20] <ZalbaarWk> if there's no jewish country how can there be jews?
[16:20] <Leik>  Yeh, Jews aren't persecuted in the US either.
[16:20] <JB_Wook13> unless we suddenly turned into an anti-semetic nazi fascist country
[16:20] * archmapping ponders just using these Egyptian textures for a deathmatch map of some sort instead of Team Fortress
[16:20] <JB_Wook13> dude
[16:20] <JB_Wook13> scientologists don't have their own country
[16:20] <ZalbaarWk> they will go into space
[16:20] <JB_Wook13> and look at mormons
[16:20] <ZalbaarWk> christians?
[16:20] <JB_Wook13> they just inhabit a specific area
[16:20] <JB_Wook13> read: utah and Arizona
[16:20] <ZalbaarWk> LOLOLOL
[16:21] <Draegan> and I truly, truly hate Mariachi music.
[16:21] <JB_Wook13> if the jews all move to an area
[16:21] <ZalbaarWk> Draegan: yes
[16:21] <rfm> JB_Wook13: YES BUT IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE SCIENTOLOGIST OR MORMON IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN'T TELL
[16:21] <ZalbaarWk> so you're saying you can see a jew from a mile off?
[16:21] <HuehueCoyotl> All religion should be outlawed
[16:21] <JB_Wook13> so jews stand out as potentially dangerous or strange people?
[16:21] <HuehueCoyotl> and then there won't be a problem
[16:21] * ZalbaarWk has jew sense. it is tingling
[16:21] <rfm> no, jews stand out as jews
[16:21] <HuehueCoyotl> More people have died in the name of god than for any other reason
[16:21] <JB_Wook13> and?
[16:22] <HuehueCoyotl> So, eliminate religion, and you eliminate the problem. :)
[16:22] <rfm> And lots of people hate jews
[16:22] <JB_Wook13> lots of people hate mormons too
[16:22] <ZalbaarWk> HuehueCoyotl: yes, and then we can have one big atheist planet
[16:22] <JB_Wook13> they need to not act so jewish
[16:22] <HuehueCoyotl> I didn't say atheist
[16:22] <HuehueCoyotl> I say no religion. :)
[16:22] <JB_Wook13> and then the problem is solved :)
[16:22] <archmapping> holy fuck i wish this band still existed
[16:22] <ZalbaarWk> but no religion implies atheistic views
[16:22] <HuehueCoyotl> I have spiritual beliefs, but I am not religious.
[16:22] <HuehueCoyotl> Not really
[16:22] <rfm> JB_Wook13: If your last name is rosenberg it doesn't fucking matter how non-jewish you act
[16:22] <ZalbaarWk> 'cos no religion = no god
[16:22] * archmapping <3 Peeping Tom
[16:22] <HuehueCoyotl> Zalbaar, wrong.
[16:22] <HuehueCoyotl> Read what I just said
[16:22] <JB_Wook13> sure it does
[16:23] <JB_Wook13> Myl ast namei s baca
[16:23] <ZalbaarWk> that's a contradiction in terms
[16:23] <JB_Wook13> as mexican as it gets
[16:23] <JB_Wook13> and I'm totally white.
[16:23] <HuehueCoyotl> Zalbaar, no it isn't
[16:23] <JB_Wook13> that's hypocrisy dear sir
[16:23] <Leik>  JB_Wook13, they did that in WWII, but they had a space problem in the potential areas so they made the ingenious idea to turn them to ash; they haven't figured a way out to turn them back though...
[16:23] <ZalbaarWk> religion = belief in something
[16:23] <HuehueCoyotl> I don't follow any religion
[16:23] <HuehueCoyotl> lol
[16:23] <HuehueCoyotl> No.
[16:23] <HuehueCoyotl> I don't follow any religion, so how would you define me?
[16:23] <HuehueCoyotl> I have personal spiritual beliefs.
[16:23] <ZalbaarWk> what do you believe in?
[16:23] <rfm> JB_Wook13: And I'm sure that there are people racist enough that they'd hate you after finding that out :)
[16:23] <JB_Wook13> diest hue
[16:23] <ZalbaarWk> what are those beliefs?
[16:23] <JB_Wook13> and it' all good
[16:23] <JB_Wook13> America was founded by diests
[16:23] <HuehueCoyotl> Diest is not a religion.
[16:23] <JB_Wook13> it's belief
[16:23] <HuehueCoyotl> But yes it was, and yes that is good. :)

[16:24] <Leik>  Religious discussions are outlawed here, btw.
[16:24] <ZalbaarWk> why?
[16:24] <Leik> better can it before the mods start banning people 
[16:24] <Leik> :P 
[16:24] <HuehueCoyotl> Leik, kill yourself
[16:24] <JB_Wook13> rfm: true, but I'm a big enough man to shoot their faces out for trying to hatecrime me
[16:24] <ZalbaarWk> well i think its much nicer than talk about niggers and jews
[16:24] <HuehueCoyotl> There are people in here capable of carrying on a decent conversation for once, it seems
[16:24] <JB_Wook13> racists: fursecute me at your own peril
[16:24] <rfm> JB_Wook13: lol, and if you're outnumbered?
[16:24] <Leik>  Furries are a race?
[16:24] <Leik> lol 
[16:24] <JB_Wook13> Assault rifles are unbanned in Arizona
[16:24] <HuehueCoyotl> Furries are a bottom of the barrel social group
[16:25] <rfm> and if THEY have assault rifles?
[16:25] <JB_Wook13> Then I'm going down like a tranny hooker on overtime
[16:25] <rfm> Yeah you're quite the internet tough guy, champ.
[16:25] <ZalbaarWk> hot and sweaty?
[16:25] <JB_Wook13> LIKE TONY MONTANA
[16:25] <JB_Wook13> XD
[16:25] <ZalbaarWk> LOLOLOL
[16:25] <JB_Wook13> hey
[16:25] <archmapping> Leik is right, though.
[16:25] <JB_Wook13> I'd rather be an internet tough guy than a persecuted jew.
[16:25] <archmapping> but uh
[16:25] <archmapping> anyway
[16:25] * JB_Wook13 /ends debate
[16:26] <JB_Wook13> at least we fought for our land
[16:26] <JB_Wook13> they got pwned X6mil
[16:26] <JB_Wook13> and we felt band and gave them a strip of land as a consolation prize
[16:26] <rfm> yeah debate totally over dude
[16:27] <HuehueCoyotl> If 'we' means Americans when we founded this country
[16:27] <JB_Wook13> nah
[16:27] <JB_Wook13> it means "we" the americans who ganked the indians
[16:27] <HuehueCoyotl> okay good, I was about to lol.
[16:27] <HuehueCoyotl> America is founded upon the genocide of native Americans.
[16:27] <HuehueCoyotl> Pretty sweet country huh
[16:27] <ZalbaarWk> awesome
[16:27] <JB_Wook13> <3
[16:27] <rfm> JB_Wook13: Are you actually descended from any of those americans?
[16:27] <StarShadow> Most countries are founded on genocide
[16:27] <JB_Wook13> yep
[16:27] <HuehueCoyotl> Star, no.
[16:27] <ZalbaarWk> like Africa
[16:27] <rfm> I mean I'm pretty sure I'm not
[16:28] <JB_Wook13> My great great great great great grampa was a texas sherriff
[16:28] <JB_Wook13> he fought in a bunch of indian gun battles
[16:28] <BearKing> failure to assimulate on thier part somewhat
[16:28] <JB_Wook13> reports of a 22-0 KDR
[16:28] <HuehueCoyotl> Sounds like a bedtime story your mom told you JB
[16:28] <rfm> I guess racism really does run in the family
[16:28] <JB_Wook13> he was shooting other mexicans :(
[16:28] <archmapping> lol JB, he should have gone CPL imo
[16:28] <JB_Wook13> nah, the bed time story was 22-0 all HS
[16:28] <JB_Wook13> no scope
