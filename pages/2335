<font size=9>DOMO FOR ALL!!!</font>



'''Domo-kun''', or simply '''Domo''', happens to be a giant walking piece of [[shit]]. Truth be told, he is also the [[furry|mascot]] for the Japanese Broadcast Company, or JBC for short. On their network, at any given moment, little "[[unfunny|funny]]" shorts used for station identification can be viewed, ranging from the vastly confusing to the God-awful want to barf feeling one gets when he or she watches Apollo 13 backwards at twice the speed. To the common ED reader, both him and his [[weeaboos|fans]] should be avoided at all costs.

== Origins ==

[[Image:DomoKun.png|thumb|right|The Aryan ideal of Domo-kun's creators.]]

As stated earlier, Domo-kun was created as a gimmick by the JBC for station identification. Why or how they did this is beyond most normal-thinking individuals - no where in the little "shorts" does the station's likeness appear, meaning it could have easily passed off as an [[crap|Eastern European art student's project from the 1980's]], which shall be discussed later. Some episodes do have a little watermark in one of the corners, however. In the first "episode", we witness an old rabbit named ''Mr. Usaji'', which is actually a play on words derived from the [[wapanese]] ''rabbit'', which is ''usagi'' (how the hell do you look at something and say it's a ''usagi'' [[amirite]]?) and grandfather, which is ''[[old|jii-chan]]''. Mr. Usaji wakes up to find an egg has somehow landed in his burrow. It hatches, and a large square-shaped turd with arms and legs pops out, complete with jagged teeth and beady eyes. Why the rabbit does not want to [[kill it with fire|kill it]] or run away is beyond us - and it's not like he can't see either, he wears [[WWII|Tojo]] specs. The second episode is where he gets his name - ''Domo'' - as he watches the television and it just so happens to say "doumo, konnichiwa." Again, the [[wapanese]] spell domo like doumo, which is basically [[moar]] proof that Domo-kun's creators are [[fucktards]].

Other characters include a bat who has a drinking problem, three [[furry|foxes]] that like to destroy things, a bear that aspires to be a [[baseball]] player, another bear who is too hungry to maul people, a weasel girl who is a [[yuppie]], and a ghost that appears randomly and seems to have no connection whatsoever with the plots. All of this is 100% [[fact]]. If you don't believe it, look it up. So when the bat-mother isn't beating her kid after spending long hours at the bar or the foxes aren't wrecking things, Domo can be found making [[retard|slow, deliberate movements, exciting blinking effects, or talking, which he does by making one long, droning yell.]]

All the "episodes" are pretty much like that. Domo-kun doesn't understand something, so the old rabbit must either teach him or face [[pain]].

== Implemented into Society ==

[[Image:Doomokun.jpg|thumb|left|180px|She was never seen or heard from again.]]

Like attracts like. You may have heard this rule before, and Domo-kun is no exception. Domo-kun first gained his (her? its?) popularity in [[Japan]], where he was quickly admired and adored by [[16-year-old girl|16-year old girls]], [[13-year old boy|13-year old boys]], and pretty much everyone in between. 

[[Image:DomoKitten.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[X Y is X|Old joke is old]].]]

But like [[Hello Kitty]], it wasn't enough to just keep the brown crap box on their own goddamn island. They had to make more money off of it. Their target: Japanese wannabe fantards and pretty much everyone else who has uttered "KawaiiiiI!!11!" in their lifetime. This, of course, is referring to pretty much half of all [[Americunt]] teens and pre-teens, as well as young adults who think he'd look cute next to their baby, because [[lie|babies aren't afraid of something that looks like it's going to fucking eat them]]. According to hardcore fantards, Domo-kun made this jump to America on July 28, 2001, when [[Fark]] reported about Domo-kun, just like they do with all other [[unfunny]] news, cliques, and random drama. [[Some argue]] it was because of the article's thread number, which happened to have [[1337]] in it. Whatever. It still doesn't account for the overpriced merchandise of Domo-kun you can find in  [[white trash|big box retailers]] in and across the US and Canada. 

Domo-kun did, however, enjoy some internet success. This was typically brought on by [[azn]] wannabes, though. Everyone has seen the Domo-kun picture with him running in a meadow with the [[God_kills_a_kitten|incorrect caption]] below that picture, which usually prompts the typical [[wtf]] response from first-time viewers. In terms of the *chans, Domo-kun has had marginal success, which is typically followed by massive [[fail]] once [[weeaboos]] get their hands on him. One can only think what these fantards truly wish to do with a brown-colored, compact, [[furry]], creature...

==Domo-kun? In My Target?==

[[Image:Domokuntarget.JPG|thumb|There is no God.]]

To cater the overprotective [[white trash|soccer moms]] and idiot [[Americunts]] who aren't weeaboo or deny the existence of Japan, department store chain [[Walmart|Target]] has taken the liberty of integrating Domo-kun into American [[failure|culture]], making him [[WTF|the mascot of Halloween]]. That means people will have access to shitty candy and anything else that the face of a brown retarded monster can be plastered on, and he'll be forever remembered as a Halloween character and not as a mascot for a Japanese TV channel and an [[old meme]]. Of course, wapanese retards who don't know any better will gladly pay [[money|top dollar]] for this [[shit|merchandise]] that will eventually be found at a local thrift shop. Needless to say, this introduction of Domo-kun to the [[mainstream]] audience will deliver untold levels of fail. More so than Domo-kun's fifteen minutes of fame in the early days of the [[Internets]].

==God Help Us All==
Below are just a few examples of the Domo-kun faggotry found from across the world.

Also, in several backwater villages across Florida, at the local 7-11 one can buy coffee in a Domo-Kup! Faggotry!

==Your Own Domo Costume==

[[Image:Make_domokun.jpg|thumb|110px|right|Being queer is a snap!]]

Lulz can be had designing your own Domo costume for Halloween. All you need is a giant cardboard box, brown paint, scissors, and no life. Just follow these steps below:
#Get a U-Haul box and paint it brown
#Cut out circular eyes, armholes, and maybe nostrils so you can see better. 
#Brown sweaters / pants could be used for arms and legs.
#Using your [[artfag]] skills, paint some teeth and a mouth.
#Have fun running around like a [[faggot]].
#????
#PROFIT!

Please note, if you do this with no prior intentions of lulz, you're a [[weeaboo]] [[fucktard]]. The world laughs at you.
