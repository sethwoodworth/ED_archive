'''[[Wikipedia:User:HighInBC|HighInBC]]''' (AKA H, AKA Until(1 == 2), AKA Chillum) , is one of the many [[TOW]] administrators who fear [[troll|trollz]] and other things that go [[rape|bump in the night]]. He speaks in the faded monotone voice of a pot ruined hippie. Due to his drug-impeded judgment he wields his banhammer like a firehose, and is clearly a [[MONGO]] sympathizer. Also, he sucks cock. 

In November of 2006, HighInBC played a prominent role in the final deletion of the [[GNAA]] article, and continued his insane crusade into the next month, by putting his [[racist]], [[fundie]] beliefs and values on display by persecuting the GNAA's  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive66#Timecop_out_of_time fearless leader] [[Timecop]]  over [[Lie|alleged]] [[Cyber|threatening phonecalls]]. Due to marijuana-induced memory loss, his former username was too long to remember so he had it changed to '''[[Wikipedia:User:H|H]]'''.
==Drama==
HighInBC's wiki-assholery finally pissed off the wrong person, and High ran afoul of an [[internet tough guy]] named ColScott (yes the King of Manson, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ColScott ColScott] on wikipedia), who posted his [[docs]] on his blog. ColScott's rabid and moronic fans started a campaign to [[Wikicide|drive HighInBC off Wikipedia]] by e-[[harassment]] and  e-[[Internet stalking|stalking]]. This failed, and Colscott and TOW came to an agreement, and peace was had.

Unfortunately for HighInBC, ColScott forgot to take down his docs, and the GNAA got their hands on them and fucking [[Ruination|ruined]] him. 

The only confirmed information we have right now is that they called his work, his cell phone, and his family, and [[Lol|threatened to kill every single fucking last one of them]]! No bitches, these phonecalls weren't made up this time. Not much is known now, but there are [[anonymous]] reports coming in that HighInBC's <s>[[sex]]-[[Black|slave]]</s> wife is dead, [http://www.gnaa.us/pr.phtml?troll=gnaa-hybc assassinated] by internet trolls (See Pic at right!). HighInBC hasn't been seen on Wiki since. Serious sources on [[TOW]] indicate that High is gone for good, and that they might finally get the smell of pot smoke out of the [[IRC]] channels.

{{Quote|If my involvement in Wikipedia is so dam important to you that you will threaten my family then fine, you win, I am outta here. I hope that satisfies you and you will leave me alone. [[The Internet is serious business|It is just a web site for fucks sake]].|HighInBC}}

In conclusion, payback's a bitch. Timecop banned, December 2006, never forget. 

But wait, there's more! Like a true [[bureaucratic fuck]] hooked on the [[Drug|wiki-crack]], '''H''' decided that having sysops on TOW was more important than his family's lives, and he came back with a new account [[Wikipedia:User:Until(1 == 2)|Until(1 == 2)]], and was granted adminship in a super secret ceremony, think [[Furluminati]]. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=&page=User+talk%3AUntil%281+%3D%3D+2%29 here], sloppy, sloppy.

==Wikicided again==

[[Last Thursday]] Chillum got upset that people were mean to him so he bawwed and flounced

{{tinyquote|Because the community has been consistently [[bawww|failing to protect its members from abuse]], and because those that do attempt to prevent such abuse are treated so hostile [[flounce|I am out of here]]. I will find a project that has minimum requirements for treating people with decency, I don't want to relive grade school again. I love the idea of Wikipedia but [[bawww|I don't see why I should keep getting kicked in the teeth]] and ask for more. Cya.}}
