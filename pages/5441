Misticvitamin
A 17 year old [[pedophile]] that chatted with a [[Anonymous|14 year old girl]] on AIM who was disguised as an [[FBI|FBI agent]]. After sending the "[[loli]]" a photo of his misshapen cock, Anonymous proceeded to bust out the always epic FBI [[copypasta]], causing misticvitamin to immediately break down and beg for forgiveness, even giving out his phone number is in an attempt to get the "FBI" off his ass.

FBI Anonymous proceeded to post the log and screenshot of misticvitamin's dick on [[4chan]]. Much lulz was to be had when other anonymous began to call his phone number. One anon got misticvitamin's mother and told her that the court day was September 7th. Another anon also called, mentioned that his son had stuck it in the girl's pooper, causing the mother to freak out. The [[OP]] also called the phone number, but apparently the OP actually did sound like a loli, misticvitamin went into disbelief.
