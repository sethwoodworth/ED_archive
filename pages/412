While many top e-psychologists have ruled the internet to be the most serious of businesses, [[some argue|many argue]] that ''American Idol'' is the most professional, serious of serial businesses to ever exist on [[Islam|Muhammad's]] great, purple [[Earth]]. The professionalism of this serious business is evident in the fact that it's always number one in ratings every single year. While you might think this means ''American Idol'' to be a good show, it is really just ''Star Search'' with everyone singing nigger music. It's hundreds of pop star/country singer/rock star rejects clambering to win a cream-of-the-crap contest. Every contestant ever to win this show has gone on to release a shitty, uninspired album consisting of pure pop culture pablum, guaranteed to be as inoffensive as they are profitable.

If you know a friend who actually buys these albums, and loves everything ''American Idol'' related, please do the world a favor and [[shotgun mouthwash|shoot that friend in the face]], as these people are a common cause of [[cancer]]. There's [[over 9000|30 million]] of these people, so there's [[Slavery|a lot of work to be done]]. [[Truth|The only reason ''So You Think You Can Dance'' is on TV at all is because it's from the creators of this crap.]]

==Format of the Show==

[[Image:Antoinella.jpg|thumb|120px|right|<strike>Antonella Barba pisses her way to the top of ''Idol''.</strike> [[PWNED]] on the final top-twelve cut.]]

For about the first month or so in the series, ''Idol'' is actually worth watching, since here they show lulz that would be regarded as some of the [[lulz|lulziest]] hours on television. Basically, [[Retard{{!}}unique]] [[shit|batshit]] people who can't sing come in and (over)act, because they're attention whores and think anyone but themselves will care that they went on TV, and sacrificed whatever dignity and self respect they ever had. Most people do it for the lulz. Interestingly enough, the people who are shown during the audition round possess a wider range of suckitude than the people who are actually good, who themselves possess a range of being a quality singer. To put that in normal people terms, everyone who gets through sounds the fucking same. 

After a bunch of losers are picked, the show moves onto Hollywood Week, where the contestants go through many yawn inducing reality show antics such as writing their own terrible songs and pairing up in threesomes. To [[noone]]'s disappointment, no sex ever occurs in these threesomes. Although much relief was felt when everyone found out [[fat|Ruben]] black person wouldn't be taking off his clothes. Ever. No one wants to see that fat blob of chocolate pudding rolling around on the ground, burying his gelatinous head into Kelly Clarkson's [[vagina|vagoo]].

==A typical black girl band entry==
(The black person [[woman|sluts]] walk in/=.)

Simon: So, what are your names?

Sluts: Ah, this is [[Sheneequa|Sheneequa]], this is Aneeta, this is Hanita, (etc).

Simon: Ok, and what are you going to sing?

Sluts: We gunna sing (Insert dramatic/slightly romantic song name here) by Destiny's Child.



Slut 1: Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah, no, no, yeah

Slut 2: WHOAWHOABABYNONOBABYWHOAWHOAWHOAWHOANONONONONONOBABYBABYBABY

Slut 3: Whooa-ooh, yeah, yeah whooa-ooh, yeah



Simon: Ok, stop.


Sluts: Ah yea was it good?


Simon: No, it was absolute crap.


Sluts: AH YEA U CAN'T SING DON'T DIS A'AR TALENT U GO TRY SING DEN LISTEN TO DIS U STILL DON'T WANNA LET DIS THRU 


Slut 1: NONONONONONBABYABYABYANONONOABYBAYBYABYBAYBANAONAONAYBAYBAYBAANAN 

*NOTE: All three sluts try to get a pity pass to [[Hollywood]], claiming those were the noises they made as they got raeped.

(Eventually, Simon has to call security to remove the sluts.)

==American Idol is a Corporate Whore==

When ''American Idol'' isn't pimping people who are carbon copies of the last million pop singers to pollute this earth, it's dropping its skimpy mini skirt and opening itself to [[rape]]. Although it would technically be consensual, since ''American Idol'' loves money like Simon Cowell loves cock. On a weekly basis, the show is assfucked by Cingular, Coca-Cola, Ryan Seacrest's hundreds of various hair products, bad taste, and Ford. Hell, half the show is devoted to promoting these shit companies.*

''*Not true. Advertising and product placement on Idol are only 46% of the show's time. That means there's 54% of pure entertainment! ''

==The Judges==

[[Image:Happy Randy Jackson Negro.jpg|thumb|right|100px|"OH LAWD, PAULA!"]]

===[[YTMND|Randy Jackson]]===

Stereotypical useless Nigglet who raffles off overused Niggarian slang, such as "Yo dog!", and "That was aiight man!". He's almost as equally useless as Paula. For a great drinking game, take a shot of Tequila (or eat a chicken wing, Randy's favorite food) every time Randy calls someone pitchy. The game would apply to every time he says "Yo", if it weren't for the fact that you would be given alcohol poisoning/[[diabeetus|diabetes]] from this.

===[[Something Awful|Simon Cowell]]===

[[Image:Simoncowell.jpg|thumb|Simon Cowell, a man devoid of any talent so much that he sucks the blood of America's innocent young victims.]]

[[Image:CowellMoney.gif|thumb|Simon Cowell wants YOU to give him all your money.]]

Semen Cumwell (moar liek cumbucket, amirite?) is one whiny individual; beingï»¿ in the business so long you wouldn't expect him to get so [[butthurt]] after every bad performance. Even considering that, he is the most mentally capable person of the three judges, actually giving helpful comments to the contestants. Because ''American Idol'''s fanbase is so [[fucktarded|mind fuckingly retarded]], they boo every single thing that comes out of Simon's mouth, because [[deviantArt|criticism is BAD and WRONG]][[oneoneone|!!!!1111one]] It doesn't really matter though, since Simon actually made the show. Because of this fact, Simon is not entitled to life, though the possibility exists that he might have created the show just so sentient life can enjoy the [[lulz]] delivered by his constant verbal [[pwn]]age of the contestants. It will be an especially lulzworthy moment when Simon meets [[Snapesnogger]], even though he will be torn apart by her fans.

[[Some argue|Some contestants argue]] that Simon should not be on the show due to being [[English]], even though they miss the point that Randy is a nigger from god knows where and Paula is an offspring of a Arab and a [[Canadian]] Jew, therefore making Simon more [[redneck|ideally]] American than the other judges.

Some info has led to the conclusion that he is actually the evil king of the beavers, as you can clearly see:
<youtube>M8el_P4yvfc</youtube>

===[[alcoholic|Paula Abdul]]===

Although she has constantly denied it, one can clearly see that Paula Abdul carries about ten whiskey canteens in her bra at a time (got to do something to make up for all that missing merchandise!), sneaking drinks from them about every half second. Because of this, Paula always acts [[beer|drunk]] when she's on ''American Idol''. She can deny that she's an alcoholic all she wants, but there's no way in hell she wasn't on something when she decided to hit [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Image:Coreyclark.jpg this]. It would be a mistake to ask Paula what she was thinking, since this would imply that Ms. Abdul actually forms thoughts in that Captain-Morgan's-soaked little brain of hers. As for her skills as a judge; [[Sheneequa|she]] never has anything useful to say.  Ever.

'''UPDATE:''' ''A day that will live in infamy'' - As of August 5th 2009, Paula will [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32293116 no longer be hosting.]]  :(

===[[Dyke|Ellen DeGeneres]]===

Ellen will combine her great success in the music industry with her biting wit to zing American Idol's performers, for the [[Fat|edification of middle America]].  That is, if she can get her face out of [[hot|Portia de Rossi's]] lap for a second or two. Although to be fair, if you had access to that lap, would you?

===[[n00b|Kara DioGuardi]]===

Is the new judge introduced in season 8 in order to make up for the fact that American Idol's only female judge is a fucked up alcoholic who is either nursing a hangover or is in the process of getting one. Unsurprisingly, DioGuardi has an IQ of 23, which is higher than the rest of the other judges IQ, especially Abdul's -54. 

She believes that she is a [[lie|good singer]] herself, the truth is that no one bought her shitty ass songs when she started her career, since they have been reported to cause the mindless idiots who bought her shit to spontaneously combust. Ironically, all the songs that she helped write for very well known singers (since the dumb-fucks don't even know how to count) usually end up as big hits. Just like the other judges, she really doesn't know what the fuck to do on the show, since she herself doesn't contribute anything useful.

==The Hosts==

===[[Uncyclopedia|Ryan Seacrest]]===

A closet [[homosexual]] who loves to wear [[women]]'s underwear and beachwear under his suits every time he goes on ''American Idol''. He is infamous for his catchphrase "Seacrest, out", leading him to believe he's [[Unwarranted self-importance|hot shit]]. Although whenever he tries to act chummy with the judges, they treat him like a big ugly dog with warts on its eyes and shun him. He once had an extremely faggy live talk show on FOX, but it got cancelled, much to the dismay of his 10 fans. Probably because FOX is poor as shit and couldn't afford Seacrest giving away so much free crap. He should be hit in the face with a tire iron and thrown screaming from a top the tallest nearby skyscraper.

It has been confirmed by former underage female AI contestants, that Simon Cowell forced them to perform sexual favors for him in turn for teh win.

===Bryan Dunkleman===

[[Dorian Thorn|Oh hell, who even cares about this faggot.]]

=="Real Talent"==
In [[Texas]], there arose such a man that all were in awe. But he was a humble man, insisting that it was Simon Cowell's glowing man-spunk that gave him an incredible voice. This man was the silver-clad, Renaldo Lapuz.

==Vote for the Worst==

[[Image:Sanjaya Girl Crying.jpg|thumb|right|"OH GOD! '''MAKE IT STOP!'''"; ''Ashley Ferl'', The Crying Girl]]

During the third season of ''American Idol'', a community called Vote for the Worst formed in the deepest bowels of the [[internet]]. Basically, a bunch of [[nerds|people]] band together to vote for the worst contestant on the show, to purposely piss off the producers and make AI fans [[butthurt]] and angry. This community alone has made the latest season, season six, highly watchable since instead of just a few people sucking, everyone sucks. They are Internet Nazis, as 3 or more posts per day on the VFTW forum qualifies an instaban. Currently, the Nazis are pooling <strike>support for Jason "Stoner" Castro.</strike> Now that they [[Fail|Failed Miserably in keeping one]] [[Faggot]], now they pool their support for David "Gaspy" Archuleta. <strike>So far, they are succeeding.</strike> They fail in the end. Many [[lul|lulz]] are had at this as all the [[fangirls]] cry.

===[[Sandjob]]===

But no one sucked quite like [[Sanjaya]] "Sandjob" Malakar. For several weeks during the finals in 2007, Sanjaya was [[fucking|hulaing]] his way though the top 12. In doing this, he had successfully pissed off everyone involved with ''American Idol''. {{youtube|7IPxBLkf2F0|He even made a little girl cry with his shrieking}}. Simon has even gone so far as to say he'd [[quit IRL|quit ''American Idol'']] if Sanjaya wins. (This statement makes one thing very clear: Sanjaya must win ''American Idol''. Except he didn't. [[Owned|Karma finally caught up with his candy-ass faggotry]].) He also has a sister with {{youtube|LV7q7eL6j1Q|quite the set of jugs}}. She originally made it to Hollywood Week, but got cut near the end, most likely due to Simon's hatred of the breasts. The /i/nsurgency was to answer to the call of [[Anonymous]] and see through to the victory of Sandjob, but they also got [[fucking]] [[owned]].

==Idol winners==

''American Idol'' winners follow a formula -- every last one of them was an unattractive, untalented, sell-out bitch who dropped out of school to be on the show, can't sing worth a fuck, and fucked the judges to win, even though the season was staged so they could win. They then pull an album out of their ass that will inevitably flop leaving them with no option but to sing in the Lion King on Broadway or gay bars in West Hollywood. Of course, anyone who tell them that they suck mad ballz is just a "jealous [[Chris Crocker|dumbass]]" Carrie Underwood is the only exception to this rule, mostly just because she's fuckin hot, unlike that fat oompa loompa Kelly Clarkson or Ms. ghetto queen [[Sheneequa|Fantasia]]. Any actual talent on her part is negligible at best, since vaginas are really [[secks|only good for one thing]].

In fact, the idols actually take longer to tour than legit musicians, because after they shit out their album, they instantly begin doing months of nothing but commercial jingles and the same putrid [[Disney]] load of shit commercial where it shows them fucking up "When you Wish Upon a Star", while they're being crowned Idol in slow motion and you can see the ghoulish, pruny smirk on their face that reminds you of [[Dubya]] when he gets away with his newest ass-rape.

The only notable ''Idol'' winner ever was [[Attention Whore|Kelly Clarkson]], but the only reason people didn't instantly forget who she was is because she looks like a pear shitting a pumpkin out of it's stem, which is so much lulz that people overlook the fact that she has a range of maybe half a note. Clarkson is such a God-Awful singer that there was a point people would rather listen to William Hung than her. The rest of the ''Idol'' "winners" should go [[Shit no one cares about|here]]. Though Carrie Underwood's NFL commercial where you saw her dick brought her a quick 15 seconds of fame.
