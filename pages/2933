Fikirtepe is the [[crap|crown jewel]] of the Constantinople, [[Turkey]] and by far the [[Ghetto|richest region in the city]]. Its inhabitants consists of [[guidos]], [[gheys]] and [[styla]]s. They can all be sorted under the title Arab of [[Turkey]].

== '''Overview of Fikirtepe''' ==

Located in the Anatolian region of Constantinople, the monthly income of its citizens are estimated roughly around 300$, which is entirely spent on black person. The arsenal of a common citizen can be quite dangerous as seen on the news. [[http://www.etikhaber.com/content/view/79488/50/]][[File:hugs.jpg|thumb|right|Give it up for Ottoman Fist Pump!]]
[[File:Apa%C3%A7i_stayla.jpg|thumb|right|Turkish people in their habitat]]

The dwellers can be summed up to these categories:

*[[Raghead]]s, muslim women are raped by their husbands and their family 7/24. [[Incest|Including brothers]].

*[[Styla]]s, low income youth infected by the [[Unrealistic Expectations|empty promises made by popular culture.]]

*[[Guido|Apache]]s, this fairly larger group is made of both stylas and strong-silent type emo group called "[[delikanlı]]," which means "crazy blood" in Turkish.

== Fikirtepe Further Explained ==


Daily life starts in Fikirtepe by Islamic prayer as wake up call. During daytime, unemployed men can be observed mostly watching gallop races or [[Pedophile|abusing children]], but they take a break from their activites at least 5 times a day to fulfill their duty to [[Allah]]. Females are forced to work as a slave in their own house to [[Kitchen|wash their man's feet and obey]]. Failure to do so will get them killed or their kidney being sold on [[eBay]]. The styla street dancers perform their magic and continue to impress while small starving children are pickpocketing tourist bystanders. Puny police forces cannot subdue these small criminals since they are agile as a Compsognathus[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRS8xBHjtic]] [[File:fikirtepe.jpg|thumb|right|Fikirtepe, the place where real men is blended everyday to their full potential.]]. Part of the youth attends to gatherings of Nationalist Movement Party, where they take oaths to kill Armenians and other minorities, apparently just for kicks, since no sane Turkish Armenian or Kurd would even come near Fikirtepe. Nearly every week a fight due of a love triangle situation occurs and [[Allah|Blood God]]'s will is satisfied. The typical male [[BAWW|sings ballads]] of [[Girlfriend|love to his affectionate]] by making [[YouTube]] videos on her name. In Turkey, every neighbourhood has its psycho, but in Fikirtepe every street has one. [[Mount|They usually ride on oversized kangal]][[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roy61jCl2o0]] dogs which are supposed to be dead years ago by rabies, but somehow with hashish and islamic dark energy, survived.

*Official fan page of the Fikirtepe on facebook[http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fikirtepe-Delikanli-Grubu/29960177687#!/pages/Fikirtepe-Delikanli-Grubu/29960177687?ref=search].

*In Fikirtepe, favourite pass time of the year is [[Sexual Harrasment]].

New Year's celebrations are the longest days for Turkish Police Force since unsexed hordes of Fikirtepeians constantly appear on the news sexually harrasing women, mostly tourists. After public footage was released in 2008 when 82 men was filmed raping women by beating their boyfriends first, they were quickly brought to justice by Istanbul's finest and were sentenced to pay a sum of 31$.

*Although Fikirtepe's image is constantly being polished by media on the news like "Fikirtepe is the perfect choice for investors in Istanbul"[http://www.haber7.com/haber/20070628/Yatirimcilarin-yeni-gozdesi-Fikirtepe.php], sometimes few heroes step up to deliver the [[lulz]] like Ömer Ulusoy, a perfect provacator who escalated a nation wide spread feeling of terror by raiding a University 500 miles away from where he lives. [[Hardcore|By wearing a sleek suit and a sword tattoo on his forehead]], [[Columbine|he fired shots to students]] and walked away. He was caught 2 years after the event when he was shopping for condoms to rape leftist girls. Few months later he was released due to his good behaviour.

*When people are not busy trading drugs and weapons, or watching football on TV or joyriding with 80 hp cars with ridicilously high volume, they like to fight. Here's an example of daily life. Be careful of the guy at 0:58. [[Cthulhu|You will hear an ancient language no one is able to comprehend]]. Oh and yes, Turkey has [[Fox News]] too.
