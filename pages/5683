[[image:Neko_myspace.jpg|thumb|Neko [[Fail|attempting]] to sport a [[MySpace]] [[Internet Disease|pose]] like every other [[typical]] [[16-year-old girl]]]]

'''Neko''' is yet another contribution to [[16-year-old]] [[drama llama]]s and makes her home on some [[weeaboo]] site [[nobody gives a shit]] about. She also has a fetish for [[emo]]s and [[FTM|girls dressed like boys]]. It is even rumored she has a thing for [[pedobear]], given her compulsive need to label any 18+ individual a [[pedophile]].

Not that pedobear has a problem with having a lolifan.

== Summary ==

Neko is your typical [[Fat_Whore|socially graceful teenage girl]]. She spends her internet time posting on the [http://www.inuyashajourneychat.com/forums/ InuYasha Journey forums] in hopes that some [[drama]] will erupt so she can have something to bitch about. Common [[weeaboo]] belief is that she is the single most prominent source of [[anti-lulz]] on the site, getting [[butthurt]] over jokes and comments that may not necessarily even address her. She also thinks [[yaoi]] is [[Kawaii|OMG KAWAII DESU NE]]![[oneoneone|!!1!]] [[^__^]]

Despite her [[anti-lulz]] ways, however, her hyper-defensive personality makes her amazingly fun to [[troll]]. [[Truth|In fact]], [[Bullshit|research has shown]] trolling is about the only way to generate any entertaining discussion with her (the only other ways are to ignore her or hope the [[mod]]s [[b&]] her again). '''[[Win|Bonus]]:''' She's also about as [[dumbass|smart as a rock]], making arguments with her extra [[lulz]]y.

For [[lulz]], you should definetly message her at kittym777@hotmail.com or call her at 705-599-4086.

Like any other [[16_year_old_girl|Sixteen-year-old-girl]], Neko also has a [[faggot|crush]] that she would [[an hero|die for.]] Ever since the [[GTFO|departure]] of this [[13_year_old_boy|faggot]], Neko has been forced to [[emo|slit her wrists]] as compensation for [[fail|not being able to fuck him.]]

== Fun facts ==

*Neko lives in [[Canada]] with her mother and more animals [[over_9000|than you can count]].
*She [[Love|fucking loves]] Pussycat Dolls (because what [[16-year-old girl]] doesn't like pop stars dressed like cheap [[hooker]]s?)
*When she doesn't agree with you, [[ALLCAPS]] ARE SURE TO FOLLOW, '''SOMETIMES WITH BOLD [[Extreme|FOR GOOD MEASURE]]'''.
*She does not believe in [[fact|lie]]s, instead choosing to stick to her guns and believe in the [[Lie|hard fact]]s.
*She is a [[A_cat_is_fine_too|fan of cats]]. (HOLY SHIT REALLY? THE PSEUDO-[[Moonspeak|MOONSPEAK]] MONIKER DID NOT GIVE THAT AWAY)

== All aboard the fail train ==

On August 8th, 2009, Neko apologists and [[idiot|internet professionals]] attempted to vandalize this ED page, resulting in many [[lulz]] when they realized ED is a wiki site with a bot that rolls back vandalism attempts.

{{clear}}
On August 10th, 2009, these people did not bother to spend the previous 48 hours pondering why their vandalism strategy didn't work the first time, instead choosing to pat each other on the back before reality sunk in:

<pre>AlbertR: There! I zarking fixed it for you! Go look. Edit: Fuck. Nvm. Gimmie sometime.

AlbertR: I tried. I failed. :(

Neko: Thank you anyways.

AlbertR: Rofl. Read the first paragraph. I edited it to make it seem like it's talking about Travis. Edit: It's stuck on auto-fix or something. Whenever I try to edit it and add happiness to it, it auto-matically goes back to being an emo page. Edit Edit: I can't even edit it to make it seem like I'm talking about someone else..What a zarking rip.

Neko: Thanks anyways Ken, but i'd like the person who did it to man up and fix it themselves, because I am not going to stop until it's fixed.
</pre>
