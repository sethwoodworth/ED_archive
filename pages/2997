[[Image:Flood_detected.jpg|thumb|The flawless shooping skill of [[anonymous]] is clearly evident]]
'''Flood detected''' is <s>the latest</s> a piece of shit [[meme]] to be spawned from the vile [[internet]] cesspool known as [[4chan]]. 

It started after [[moot|moot's]] [[The Chemo That Is Curing /b/|recent faggotry]] meant a lot more posts on [[B/|/b/]] were being blocked with the message "Flood detected". As a result, a [[Fag|really, really clever]] [[/b/tard]] made the stunning leap of logic and realised that "flood" could be interpreted as "The Flood" from [[Halo]]. One shitty shoop and a [[Fail|super-duper-awesome]] thread later, and you have the comedic brilliance which only a greasy cluster of [[anonymous]] [[basement dweller]]s can achieve. Which is to say, very little.

== Usage ==
Flood detected usually consists of Captain King having a [[Drug#Heroin|Sherlock Holmes]] hat, pipe and magnifying glass [[photoshop]]ped onto him, or [[Shit nobody cares about|amazingly funny macros]] with Captain King and the flood. Flood detected is known to be super effective against combofags, who will themselves have to combat the [[Nazi|timeout limits]] on posting in a thread.

== Controversy ==
[[Some argue]] Flood detected is made of [[epic]] [[win]]. Actually, there isn't really much controversy, really, because they're wrong. It isn't.
