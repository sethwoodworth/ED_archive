== Purpose ==
Done in the spirit of Ambrose Bierce's [[The Devil's Dictionary]], '''Encyclopædia Dramatica''''s purpose is to provide a central catalog for the e-public to view parody and satire of [[drama]], [[meme]]s, [[e-pal]]s and other interesting happenings on the [[internets]]. 
The goal is to provide comprehensive, reference-style parody, to poke fun at everyone and everything on the internet.

While the articles themselves are mostly satirical jabs at Internet users (both individually and in groups) and phenomena, bear in mind that the Encyclopædia Dramatica itself is a parody of a [[Wikipedia|much less funny online encyclopedia]].  As such, ED articles tend to make fun of the supposed [[NPOV|objectivity]] and [[factual inaccuracy|accuracy]], [[nazi|elitism]], and [[WikiEdit Drama|stupid edit wars]] of such sites.  In other words, expect blatant, biased lies, and expect boring truths to get deleted quickly.

ED's third purpose is to catalogue [[Internets phenomena]].  In this role, it's actually a fairly good reference for [[drama]]tic events and things like [[meme]]s and [[netspeak]], provided you bear in mind the first two purposes and take what you learn with a [[Girlmecha]]-sized grain of salt.

== History == 
Sparked after several people were denied from posting to [[Wikipedia]]. The moniker was [[coin]]ed by [http://livejournal.com/users/33mhz 33mhz] on [[jameth]]'s [http://www.jameth.us journal]. [[Mediacrat]] was the crucible that created ED.

Encyclopædia Dramatica was created December 8-10th 2004 while [[girlvinyl]] was impatiently awaiting the delivery of her [http://www.apple.com new ibook]. [[ghettofinger]] and [[girlvinyl]] were outraged and amused at the ill-treatment of [[internet celebrity]] [[jameth]] by the moderators and [[nerd]]s at [[wikipedia]]. [[Girlvinyl]] decided it was time to present an alternative to the fascist hold they had over information on the internets. 

Creation of the project was swift and is under constant development. December 10 was the inaugural install and first operational night of Encyclopedia Dramatica. ED has since peaked at a an alexarank of approx. 1800, not counting the [[RFJCLE]] fiasco which put ED on the national news and crashed our servers [[2006|back when they sucked]].

All users are welcomed to create and modify content to more accurately reflect the internets and help archive the never ending supply of hysterical [[e-drama]]. Please continue to add articles so that the Encyclopedia Dramatica will provide answers to questions like "What the hell is [[mediacrat]]?" and "Where are the [[lulz]]?".
