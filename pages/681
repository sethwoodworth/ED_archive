'''Atlus''' is a [[Japan]]ese game company known for making games that require actual brainpower to beat, if you suck shit at thinking then your best bet is to grind untill you can press X to win like in Final Fantasy. Their fans are even more pathetic than [[World of Warcraft|Warcrack]] addicts, because unlike an MMO, Atlus games have no potential for even online social interaction to occur.

However, it should be noted that [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Atlus America does not actually develop games, but they are more of a localization service, translating games from many developers into]] [[English]].

== Atlus Games ==
Atlus Games are famous for requiring more grinding than [[World of Warcraft]] and being more creatively bankrupt than the latest EA Sports rehash. Some of their most famous games include:

=== Persona ===
[[Image:Fatlus feels Japanese.png|thumb|Shooting yourself in the head to summon monsters is a national sport in Japan.]]
A game where you [[An_hero|shoot yourself in the head]] to summon your "persona", which fights monsters for you. Popular with [[emo]] kids because it involves shooting yourself in the head. Persona 4 upped the ante by introducing a [[fag]] and a [[reverse trap]] into the mix, giving [[/v/]] an excuse to make [[over 9000]] threads about it as they all simultaneously got a boner.

The second game also had Hitler on it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS_4RvPvTS0

=== Shin Megami Tensei ===
You play the role of just [[Anonymous|an average guy fapping to porn on the Internet]]. Then you get a popup telling you that you can summon [[goatse|demons]] through the computer. Common sense would have told you not to click popups, but you're an idiot. After fucking up the world, you're now a patsy stuck in a war between [[Longcat|God]] and [[Tacgnol|Lucifer]]. Sucks to be you. Seeing as how you can kill God in this game, it's perfect troll material for [[Christfag]] gamers. Just go to any Christian gaming board and recommend it to someone looking for a new RPG to play. Don't spoil the plot for them, it's funnier if they find out themselves.

=== Digital Devil Saga ===
[[Image:Digital Devil Saga OM NOM NOM.jpg|thumb|They are deelishus enemeez; you must OM NOM NOM them!]]This game takes place in a [[Jenkem|really fucked up]] world called the Junkyard, where [[Fucktards|everyone]] dances to the will of [[WTF|upside down naked albino people]] [[Mecha-Dildo|strapped to a machine]]. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTCxVY0MGtw|Seriously.] Amidst being pleasured to [[Drunk|new heights of ecstacy,]] they tell the asstards that they must ascend the [[9/11|obligatory Shin Megami Tensei tower]] to reach [[Caek|Nirvana]]. One day a [[Lazer|Lazer]] descends from the heavens and causes everyone to [[OM NOM NOM|OM NOM NOM]] each other. It is said that every time Fatlus OM NOM NOMZ another [[Scientologist|enemy]], he gains [[OVER 9000]] [[MOAR|MOAR]] pounds.

=== Disgaea ===
Nobody knows what this game is about, other than killing the same penguin millions of times in hopes of finally leveling up enough to advance the plot (which will never happen). This game is also notable for their refusal to upgrade the graphics beyond anything you might see on [[Habbo]]- even with the superior power of da [[Playstation 3|PS Triple]] (word yo) at their disposal.  It also houses [[over 9000]] kids who think they are [[otherkin]].  Prime example would be [http://www.youtube.com/user/adventxangel adventxangel.] He is the real Laharl!  News flash!  He's 24 years old and trolls people's comment boxes!  Another Disgaea worshipper is [http://www.youtube.com/user/liubaio Liubaio.]  He faps off to Disgaea 24/7, but is rather unfunny.  He does get [[butthurt]] alot and can't defend himself well.  His modding skills are piss poor.  That's because he has raped over 9000 penguins in the process.
Like [[Capcom]] with Devil May Cry, they thought that the series was so [[lie|awesome]], that it was completely [[not|necessary]] to make an [[anime]] out of it. Like Devil May cry, it [[Beer|barley]] has more than 10 episodes which involves nothing but [[lame]] and unfunny jokes that [[fail|makes disney channel shows more desirable]]. The only difference between the 2 is that Dante from devil may cry does nothing but eat [[American|pizza]], and Laharl from Disgaea is a skinny pussy that thinks his lame shorts and shoes are [[1337]]. But they both have a too good-for-you attitude.

=== Trauma Center ===
Trauma Center is a game developed for the [[Nintendo]] DS and Wii. This game provides a [[Lies|realistic portrayal of surgery]], in which the player is required to perform tasks seen by everyday surgeons such as removing tumors, disarming bombs lodged in their patients' anal cavity, [[What|drawing the pentagram to slow down time]] and [[Giant_enemy_crab|removing indestructible spider webs created by mutant-superviruses from their patients' hearts]].

== Atlus Fans ==
Due to the excessive amount of sitting on your ass and absorbing radiation from your TV screen required to play these games, Atlus Fans (aka "Fatlus") are all incredibly fat, as depicted by this series of [[MS Paint]] pictures, ironically, created by [[/v/]] whose populace is just as fat.
