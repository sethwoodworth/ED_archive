Windows Media Failure
'''Windows Media Player''' is yet another bloated [[whore]] piece of software brought to you by the [[Sick Fuck|toothless chaps]] over at [[Microsoft]]. Nobody loves Windows Media Player. You can play songs and shit and watch movies and what have you, and is the default [[pr0n]] player that has come with every version of windows for the last hundred years. Everybody loves pr0n, nobody loves Windows Media Player. Unfortunately, no video format is known to play on it unless you download additional codecs. It offers an easy to use interface, such as closing the window and getting [[winamp]]. Helpfully, WMP [[fail|organizes]] all your [[CP|media]] for you, but only after waiting hours while it is being added to the built-in library. However, there are several [[lies|innovative features no other player half its size implements]], such as [[winamp|syncing]] your [[Mitchell Henderson|Ipod]], and [[winamp|scrobbling]] your shitty music to display on your [[Last.fm]] profile.

For some reason, [[Windows 7]] does not support the Windows Media Player toolbar, which was the main reason that [[you|most people]] used WMP.
