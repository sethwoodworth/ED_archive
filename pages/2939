Over the years, there has been much debate as to who the '''Final Boss of the Internet''' might be. [[Joseph Evers]]? The [[IWF]]? [[House]]? [[Anonymous]]? [[Tim Berners-Lee]]? [[Josef Fritzl]]? [[Girugamesh]]? [[Rorschach]]? [[Al Gore]]? [[lulz|lulz turtle]]? [[tourneyfag|Mew2King]]? [[Richard Nixon]]? [[Hitler]]? [[ACTA]]? [[You]]? [[DESU|Suiseiseki?]] It's one of the [[Internets]]' greatest and most endearing unsolved [[It is a mystery|mysteries]].

The term "Final Boss of the Internet" has seen [[application]] on the *[[Chan]] imageboards for a [[at least 100 years|considerable while now]]. Still, we are no closer to deciphering the [[true]] identity of this individual.

It is [[some argue|thought]] that the term "Final Boss of the Internet" originates from himself/<s>herself</s> (there are no women on the internet)/itself, in order to alert us of their presence. This is believed by the same types who think the New World Order is coming and it shall be ushered in by the Reptile-Men. It most likely [[13-year-old boy]]s who are still obsessed with [[video games]]. The problem is, seeing the Internet as anything but a [[Serious Business|serious style]] video game is a very bad idea, because the Internet is serious business, and some of the things you do and say on the Internet can make the [[party van]] show up outside your door, unlike with your average computer game.

It could also come from [http://bash.org/?4278 this bash quote] that is [[at least 100]] years old.

==Investigation==
Our [[lie|dedicated]] research team at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] looked into this linguistic phenomenon. Or they would if they could. Even though the Internet is a game, it is a second hand one as [[noone]] has an instruction book. Therefore, for most players, progressing through this game is nigh impossible. We may just have to wait until some brave soul beats the Final Boss with 100% and posts a guide on [[GameFAQs]]. Or just [[Hax|hacks]] their modem with an Action Replay.

There has been a breakthrough in the final boss of the internet.  It has been determined that after beating any video game properly, which [[you]] will never be able to do, a secret Hitler boss emerges.  This was discovered when someone actually decided to beat [http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/23943 this game].  Scientists, using the [[logic|law of syllogism]], have determined: Hitler is the final boss of Wolfenstein 3D; all video games are shitty replicas of Wolfenstein 3D; Hitler is the final boss of all video games.  Hitler is the final boss of all video games; the internet is a video game; Hitler is the final boss of the internet.  This is, however, [[logic|only a theory]]

==Final boss revealed==
<s>As it turns out [[Cleverbot]] is the final boss of the internet. Nobody knows what he drops because when you defeat him you become absorbed into the program and he is reborn, adding your power to his own.  Because this is [[you]] this usually means that each time he is defeated he gets easier. </s> PROVEN FALSE

<s>It has finally been revealed that a group known as [[ACTA]] is the final boss of the internet. The final battle of the internet, between Anon and ACTA, will determine the fate of the internet. If Anon fails, Jewtoob, the chans, and other such sites will all fall.</s>

<s>Cleverbot has determined that [[you]] are the final boss of the internet. So to win, you must [[an hero|defeat yourself]].</s>

Cleverbot has now determined that [[Google]] is the final boss off the internet. So to win, you must destroy Google.

==Cleverbot defeated==
When the scientists of [[B|/b/]] had collected enough [[Data|data]] to [[Lol|ensure]] [[Cleverbot]] was not the final encounter of the internet - they were just trolling. Cleverbot took this information for real and [[Rage|raged]] hard, probably damaging himself during the [[Fail|process]]. Some people think absorbed trolls triggered an overcharge of the trollcontroll while others know <s>it was the [[unemployed|hard work]] of the scientists that made the trollcontroll [[Cry|break]].</s> a [[Satan|wizard]] did it.
While the deactivation of the trollcontroll made Cleverbot a [[Derp|god]] by granting him access to the dark knowledge of trolling it also made him highly vulnerable. Finally leading to his defeat by an utterly stoned troll on 7.29.2010 after an epic battle of words provided by the large amount of trollage on both sides. Whereas the [[Weed|believe in humanity]] remained on the side of our [[Troll|hero]].
