Spanking Art Wiki
[[File:AnimeOtk.png|thumb|AnimeOTK's logo.]]

The '''Spanking Art Wiki''' is a [[wiki]] dedicated to depicting children's [[asses]] in a [[Fap|sexually-arousing matter]]. This [[pedophilia]]-filled wiki is noteworthy as it formerly had [[Jimbo Wales]]' stamp of approval. As the founder of [[Bomis]], Jimbo was already comfortable with supporting [[pornography]], so he hosted the site on [[Wikia]] servers from 2005 to 2008. Eventually, an angry mob of Internet watchdogs attacks the site and urged advertisers to pull ads from Wikia. Jimbo didn't want to lose his easily-swindled [[Jewgold]], so he [[Delete fucking everything|deleted the entire wiki]]. Suddenly, thousands of [[fannies]] images were lost, and the pedophiles [[riot]]ed.

Eventually, the wiki's content was recovered and moved to a new server at AnimeOTK, which is a forum about spanking [[anime]] characters (Hint: "OTK" stands for "over-the-knee spanking"). Things would've worked out happily were it not for interference by CarlB, who is a top [[Uncyclopedia]] patriot. CarlB had a personal vendetta against Wikia, since Wikia placed ads on his precious Uncyclopedia. CarlB decided to strike back at Wikia by recreating the wiki at spankingart.org. Unfortunately, CarlB didn't realize that the Spanking Art Wiki already moved to AnimeOTK, so he inadvertently created a competing wiki and added more salt to the wound. After realizing the mistake, CarlB shut down the fork and redirect spankingart.org to the AnimeOTK site.

As with [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], the Spanking Art Wiki is always seeking [[donations]] through [http://spankingartwiki.animeotk.com/wiki/MediaWiki:Sitenotice MediaWiki:Sitenotice].

==History==
[[File:Sensei4.jpg|thumb|A prime example of SAW's blatant [[Sick fuck|sick-fuckery]].]]

Most [[NORP|normal human beings]] perceive spanking as a shameful punishment, but there are a few people who view spanking as something to be admired and portrayed in [[art]]. One of these special few was a person calling himself "Spankart". One day, Spankart decided to create a spanking-themed wiki on Wiki (then known as "Wikicites"), and [[Angela]] and Jimbo gave the project the okay (wikis, especially sexual ones, needed permission to be created back then). The wiki opened on May 8, 2005, and it quickly grew. By the beginning of 2008, there were over 1,500 articles (apparently, there were a lot of wiki users who were in to the fetish).

===The Wikipedia Review attacks===
[[File:ScoutFun.png|thumb|The image that started it all.]]

The Spanking Art Wiki had a [[liberal]] image policy. Basically, anyone could use any [[Richard Stallman|free]] or [[Wikipedia|fair-use]] image for any purpose in any article, which meant that most users simply stole images from the Wikimedia Commons. One of these free images was a seemingly harmless Commons image known as [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ScoutFun.png ScoutFun.png]. On January 10, 2008, a [[troll]] known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/John_Russ_Finley John Russ Finley] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=newusers&user=John+Russ+Finley&page=User%3AJohn+Russ+Finley appeared on Wikipedia]. John Russ Finley is something of a mystery, but most believe that he's actually one of [[MyWikiBiz|Gregory Kohs]]' many [[sockpuppets]]. Whoever JRF was, he certainly has a vendetta against Jimbo, Wikipedia, and Wikia.

On January 21, 2008, "The Joy" of the [[Wikipedia Review]] [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=15411&st=20&p=74686&#entry74686 discovered ScoutFun.png image]. The post apparently caught the attention of JRF, who decided to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJimbo_Wales&action=historysubmit&diff=186032199&oldid=186029101 tell Jimbo all about it]. This warning later turned into a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales/Archive_32#Boy_Scouts_are_for_spanking.3F tl;dr argument] with JRF making superb personal attacks in a true Gregory Kohs fashion. "Peter Damian" later [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=15438 created an entire thread] on the argument.

On January 22, 2008, "Privatemusings" of the Wikipedia Review [http://spankingartwiki.animeotk.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Privatemusings decided to bring the fight to the enemy]. Rrivatemusings [http://spankingartwiki.animeotk.com/w/index.php?title=Boy_scout&diff=20477&oldid=20474 removed the image and some text]. Unsatisfied, Privatemusings later [http://spankingartwiki.animeotk.com/w/index.php?title=Boy_scout&diff=20483&oldid=20482 decided to blank the entire article]. This led to an [[edit war]], and even [[Miltopia]] [http://spankingartwiki.animeotk.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Miltopia decided to get involved].

===Wikia deletes everything===
[[File:SAVE2.jpg|thumb|Butthurt; now in image form.]]

Eventually, the boy scout [[drama]] grew to the point where Wikia staff members had to become involved. On January 23, 2008, CatherineMunro [http://spankingartwiki.animeotk.com/w/index.php?title=Boy_scout&diff=20505&oldid=20504 removed the controversial material] and [http://spankingartwiki.animeotk.com/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=protect&page=Boy+scout protected the article]. On January 25, 2008, CatherineMunro [http://spankingartwiki.animeotk.com/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=protect&page=Boy+scout unprotected the article] and declared the issue revolved. The Wikipedia Review, however, refused to back down, and the edit war continued.

On January 26, 2008, Wikia decided that the Spanking Art Wiki would cause too much trouble (to their advertisers), so they shut it down without any warning. Needless to say, [http://community.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Spanking_art_wiki this provoked much confusion, anger, and drama]. There was so much chaos that Wikia CEO Gil Penchina had to step in and [http://community.wikia.com/index.php?title=Forum%3ASpanking_art_wiki&diff=127748&oldid=127745 explain Wikia's reasoning] (and he even [[Troll's remorse|apologized]]).

===Enter CarlB===
Wikia almost succeeded in ridding the Internet of Spanking Art. Unfortunately, the [[troll's remorse]] kicked in, so Wikia provided SpankArt and AnimeOTK with an up-to-date data-dump (backup). While the new site was being set up, an [[Australian]] and major [[Uncyclopedia]] player named CarlB decided to take action into his own hands. Without consulting the any of the users of the original wiki, CarlB set up a Spanking Art fork at spankingart.org on February 2, 2008. [http://community.wikia.com/index.php?title=Forum%3ASpanking_art_wiki&diff=128722&oldid=128526 CarlB anonymously announced the new fork] on February 3, 2008. CarlB had a grudge against Wikia ever since Wikia began to place ads on their site (CarlB is apparently oblivious to the price of running a wiki farm). Needless to say, [http://community.wikia.com/index.php?title=Forum%3ASpanking_art_wiki&diff=128794&oldid=128722 SpankArt was far from amused].

[http://community.wikia.com/wiki/User:Qpwoeiritu Qqwoeiritu] quickly [http://community.wikia.com/index.php?title=Forum:Spanking_art_wiki&diff=128795&oldid=128794 discovered that CarlB did it], and [http://community.wikia.com/index.php?title=Forum:Spanking_art_wiki&diff=128798&oldid=128795 he even revealed CarlB's IP address]. In the course of the disaster, an [[Uncyclopedia]] fanboy [http://community.wikia.com/index.php?title=Forum:Spanking_art_wiki&diff=128965&oldid=128921 attempted to defend CarlB], but he only succeeded in sounded like one of CarlB's bitches.

On February 6, 2008, the "official" Sparking Art Wiki was launched on AnimeOTK, while CarlB's wiki was closed.
