'''The Cold War''' was an IRL drama that occured between 1947 and 1991. It involved the [[USA]] and the [[USSR]] squaring off over which nation had the largest [[W|political dick]]. It began after Hitler became [[an hero]] after Berlin was [[Pwnt|entered]] [[Whore|from several directions]], and the Communists and Capitalists had time to fall out with each other instead. The Cold War [[Fail|never became a war as such]], and was devoid of any direct conflict between the two parties involved. Instead, the two countries [[Troll|argued over ideology]], ran [[meatspin|propaganda campaigns]], became involved in [[dox|espionage]], and made other small nations fight for their own amusement. Eventually, the Soviet Union [[Self-pwn|bankrupted itself due to unreasonable expensive arms campaigns]], and the Americans won. 





== Origins ==
Following the [[fail|fall]] of Berlin and the end of WW2, the Allied Powers found themselves disagreeing on how to run Hitler-less [[Nazis|Germany]].  More specifically, the U.S wanted to paint the country a lovely shade of [[butthurt]] blue, but the Soviets were adamant about the [[over 9000|ten thousand]] gallons of [[rape]] red that Stalin ordered to be made for arbitrary reasons.  After painting the whole of Germany, the US and USSR proceeded to paint the rest of the world either red or blue.  A 44 year standoff with <s>thousands of nuclear weapons at the ready</s> '''[[truth|THOUSANDS OF THERMONUCLEAR DICKS]]''' ensued.

[[Image:SSgouzenko.JPG|thumb| Gouzenko trolling as Anonymous]] Soviet Russia being a diplomatic new nation and friend to everyone decided that they should make embassies. In a Canadian embassy there was Igor Gouzenko. Igor, one day in 1945 got a letter from his government saying he had to go home. Igor liking his life in Canada, did not want to give up his subscription to Beaver Magazine or his maple syrup. Afterall he couldn't have his wife feed him and his unborn child on those shitty food rations and live in a small house without a newfangled furnace. Who wants to burn wood for heat ammirite? Thus, the Gouzenko had a thought, a terrible thought. You see Igor was a cipher clerk in the embassy he filed things that had ciphers, you could say he had a collection of files about what Russia thought of Canada, the US and Britain. The files also had information about sleeper agents and nukes. So he stole fucking everything and visited the media. Igor with the humongous file collection ran into the offices and screamed "It's war! It's Russia!" Naturally, they laughed their asses off and sent the crazy fuck out on his arse. Instead he went to the RCMP. Who being the nice gentlemen and ladies they are got him contact with CSIS (it's like CIA but more Canadian). After realizing his shit was legit Canada told Britain, and then America was told too. Thus starting the shitstorm once the American government heard about the Ruskie's plans of evil spying!

Igor was then given witness protection, appeared to the media and court as Anonymous (he wore a bag over his head). Igor's documents busted 39 spies in Canada alone. But half of it was bullshit and only 18 of them were really spies. Igor knows sleepers, he's seen quite a few people sleep in his time. Gouzenko then wrote two books which were fucking awful, and sail the promotional waves still dressing like prechan Anonymous. The only people who ever saw his face after his defection were his family and co-workers. After doing the whole media frenzy and getting a movie called Iron Curtain made about him he got fat, spent his money on anything that had a price tag, just like MC Hammer and Will Smith, only he had less money, and no lulzworthy song. When he asked Canadian government to be paid $7000 a year, they politely told him to GTFO and then he got the beetus and went blind. Then finally the epic troll died in 1982. Anyway to sum it up Igor is the asshole who started the Cold War.

== The Iron Curtain ==
[[Image:Reagan_smash.gif‎|thumb|Reagan single handedly taking down the Berlin wall]]
Severely [[butthurt]] over the fact that none of the other Allied Powers were down with his whole a-million-deaths-is-a-statistic idea, Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] took the most [[butthurt|mature]] route and promptly established a metaphorical "Iron Curtain" across Europe, dividing the continent into the Eastern Block, which included Russia, its satellite states and a slice of Germany, and the Western Block, which included pretty much everyone else.  The Iron Curtain was centered in Berlin, where a massive wall was [[boner|erected]] through the middle of the city [[serious business|just to show how serious Stalin was about his breakup with the West]].  Spearheaded by the Americans, the remaining Allied Powers formed the [[NATO]], an organization who members vowed to defend one another if they were invaded, apparently completely forgetting about [[WW1|the disaster that occurred the last time Europe tried mutual protection pacts.]]  In response the Soviet Union drafted up the Warsaw Pact, a <s>similar treaty</s> of [[lies|friendship]] between the USSR and the states it was [[raping|oppressing]].

== International Trolling ==
The Cold War is notable for the displays of [[epic]] [[trolling]] done by both the US and USSR.  Some of the more memorable [[fail|incidents]] include:

[[Image:Big_scary_bear.jpg‎|thumb|The Russian's most dangerous weapon]]
*'''The Berlin Blockade''': [[Did it for the lulz|Stalin thought it would be funny]] if he cut off all of the supply routes into West Berlin thus forcing the US and Britain to suck his dick in order to get the food and fuel that they needed.  The West responded with the Berlin Airlift, a series of massive airdrops that kept their half of the country well nourished and fueled, [[Counter troll|and totally made the USSR look stupid]].  After the success of the airdrops Stalin had a bout of [[troll's remorse]] and lifted the blockade.

*'''[[Korean War|The Korean War]]''': When Communist [[North Korea]] invaded the Democratic South as part of their campaign to ensure that no one in Korea would ever have access to electricity.  The US and UK immediately rushed to the South Koreans aid, [[stupid|sending thousands of troops to help defend a region that most American's probably couldn't find on a map]].  The North however, was backed by the massive Chinese army and the USSR, [[smart|who only sent weapons and supplies instead of their own soldiers.]](Actually the Soviets did send fighter pilots because every one knows [[Truth|Asians can't drive for shit]]).  The war ultimately ended in a stalemate, and Korea remains divided along along the 38th Parallel, [[fail|exactly as it had before 3 million died fighting over it]].

*'''U2 Incident''': Pilot Francis Gary Powers was flying [[drunk]] and got his ass shot down over Soviet airspace.  The US initially tried to deny that the plane was theirs, claiming that it was [[o rly|obviously a civilian pilot who simply got lost at 70,000 feet]].  That story, however, went right out the window when [[pwnt|the USSR produced a live pilot and extensive wreckage of the spy plane]], humiliating US leaders and adding 3 inches to Soviet Head of State Nikita Khrushchev's penis.  Ironically enough, of the 8 SAM missiles launched at Powers' aircraft, one of them [[epic fail|actually hit and took down a MiG that had been sent to intercept the U2]].  

[[Image:Kennedy_fail.jpg‎|thumb|Kennedy's face upon realizing he's been trolled hard by Castro]]
*'''The Bay of Pigs''': PROTIP: [[Gone get raped|Never send a bunch of ex-con's and Cuban exiles to invade a nation backed by Soviet armor and artillery]].

*'''[[Cuban Missile Crisis]]''': The cuban missile crisis happened because Castro wanted some dick to suck after taking over cuba, so he went to the USSR and demandied to see the big dick in charge, when he saw the soviet leader he took his cloths off immediately got to his knees and sucked the shit out of the soviet leader, after the leader blew his load through every hole of Castro's body, Castro asked if he could get nukes for Cuba so he could IRL troll the fuck out of the Americunts. After the Americunts found out what Castro did it was all over the news with the headline in the press saying "Fidel Castro sucks soviet leader's cock". After Castro heard about this madness he began to troll the Americunts saying "If you don't retract these libellous claims I'm gonna throw a hissy-fit and nuke you!". As soon as Castro had made this laughably feeble threat (because obviously Khrushchev wouldn't have given that filthy dago launch codes) the Americunts almost injured themselves laughing, right up until 1991 when he came out of the closet. It was an epic win for Americunts and a good day for Walt Disney.                                        

*'''[[Vietnam War]]''': Notable for being one of the most epic fails in US history, the Vietnam War was the result of trolls not knowing when to pull out.  It all started when USSR-backed North Vietnam attacked US-backed South Vietnam, being super secret, the US began to B-52 the shit out of the NVA.  Calling [[hax]], the NVA brought in their buddies in the USSR and hid in places like tunnels and [[lulz|schools]].  After about a good 10-15 years of a so-called "Secret War", the US went into overkill mode and thought that it was Korea all over again.  It ended up being like the ending of Platoon, but over, and over, and over, and over.

*'''Afghan Invasion''':  The USSR wasn't cool with only the US pulling an epic fail, so they decided to reenact Vietnam in Afghanistan.  The US and Super-Troll Charlie Wilson gave the local Mujahideen Resistance every gun ever, and a few Stinger missles, to fight the Soviets with.  In the resulting carnage, the [[lulz|whole Soviet army got defeated by a few guys toting RPGs and AK-47s hiding in mountains]].  That sounds familar!  [[Billy Mays|But wait, THERES MORE!]]  There was also this one cool dude who got access to the US funded buttload of guns, his name was Osama bin Laden.  Not even shitting [[you]].

== [[Space|The Space Race]] ==
[[Image:Challenger_Explosion1.jpeg‎|thumb|Just one of NASA's many failures]]
The Cold War also played host to the Space Race, in which the US and Soviet Union raced to see who <s>could fatally launch someone into orbit first</s> [[avatar|has the best special FX skills]].  Sputnik 1 made America [[butthurt]] as the Soviets sent the first man made [[dildo|object]] into space ([[SPACE NAZIS|that we know of]]).  Russia added salt to the wound with Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, hoping that the rest of the world would forget about the horrid [[fail|failure]] rate of their missions.  NASA went on to [[truth|fake the moon landing]] and [[lulz|blow up space shuttles]], still oblivious that the [[Nazi|Nazi's]] were already actually [[truth|on the moon]].

== The Arms Race ==
A superpower's [[Chode|dick]] size is measured by the number of nuclear missiles (LOL! THEY'RE SHAPED LIKE PENISES GET IT?!!!!!!) they have at their disposal. Just like any [[man]] knows, he will tend to [[lie|exaggerate slightly]] to make himself seem more [[Erectile dysfunction|potent]] than he really is. Every time the Soviets [[Cock|whipped out]] their wares for display at their [[Objectophilia|May Day parade]], the US military would demand more <s>penises</s> weapons so the other countries wouldn't [[My Tiny Dick|laugh at them]] in the shower. The Soviets would in turn build more [[Dongcopter|weapons]] to [[goatse|close the gap]]. The whole cycle would repeat itself until the world runs out of fissionable material or [[Castration|everyone dies]], whichever happened first.

== [[lie|The Strategic Defense Initiative]] ==
[[Image:Lego death star 1.jpg‎|thumb|The finest 1980's high-tech weaponry that money could buy]]
On March 23, 1983, [[Star Wars Kid|Ronald Regan]] unleashed his greatest troll on mankind. The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was Regan's [[troll|plan]] to build a deathstar to end this <s>destructive</s> [[Circle jerk|conflict]] once and for all.  The Soviets collectively shit their pants and started work on an even better deathstar with blackjack and hookers. This is why SDI was nicknamed "[[Star Wars]]," honest. The fact of the matter is that Regan knew it was impossible to really build a fucking deathstar. But [[OMG|holy fucking shit]], the Russians [[Gullible|lapped that shit up]] and bankrupted the whole country trying to build one. Every scientist not in on the joke [[butthurt|denounced]] SDI and called it a farce. It didn't matter, because [[Global Warming|nobody ever listens to scientists]].

== Collapse of the USSR ==
After being [[pwnt]] by the Arab during their failed invasion of Afghanistan, the Soviets returned to Russia, where a [[Detroit|failing economy]] awaited them.  As Gorbachev realized that the USSR was [[dying alone|dying]], which was [[obvious|tipped off]] by the fact that the Soviet military [[no u|refused to take orders]] from the [[KKK|Kremlin]], he tried what he called [[goatse|glasnost]].  The glasnost (or "Openness") took down the "Iron Curtain" and led directly to the fall of the Communist Party.  Oh, and some [[shit|shitty]] concrete wall.

== The Colder War ==

[[some argue|Some believe]] that the Cold War had [[O RLY|ended in 1991]]. However, everyone with a 2 digit or more IQ score, can notice that the Cold War is not over, but rather mutated into an even [[Above Top Secret|more secretive]] conflict, known as The [[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger|Colder]] War. Sure, on the surface it might seem that the U.S. and Russia are [[BFF|BFFs]] - Russia is supplying the U.S. with cheap [[whores]] and mail order brides, the U.S. is infecting Russia with it's McDonald's and reality TV - but behind the scenes the [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE|war machine]] keeps going. The Americans have placed nukes and missile interceptors in Poland, Russia's annoying neighbor, just to show those dirty Commies who's in charge (to which the Russians responded by [[Polish Lollercaust|wiping out the entire Polish goverment]]). Meanwhile, the Russians are selling weapons to every [[Iran|country]] or [[Al qaeda|organization]] that hates America, to afford their [[Alcoholic|vodka addiction]], and are keeping a good steady relationship with [[why do you hate america?|America's haters]] such as Iran, North Korea and China. tl;dr, just like the in the Cold War itself, the Americans and Russians are fighting each other without "really" fighting. [[Sheep|BUT EVERYTHING IS OK, MOVE ALONG FOLKS, NOTHING TO SEE HERE.]] But what about China?

==TL;DR==
'''The US and USSR had a near-5 decade long intercontinental thermonuclear dick waving contest, and the whole of the Third World had to swallow.'''
