Kitsune Youkai
[[image:Kitsune and firecat.jpg|thumb|right|In actuality, there is only one furfag in this picture.]]
On the vast reaches of [[the internet|les tubes]], people have for years been making [[sockpuppets]] on [[forums]], [[DA|online communities]], and even our blessed [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. [[some argue|Some people]] only make [[sockpuppets|alternate accounts]] for peaceful purposes, such as [[buttsex|sharing]] an account with other people to collaborate on work. [[trolls|Others]] make their [[sockpuppets|alts]] in order to troll people under [[proxy|false pretenses.]] There are even [[spam|those]] that would make hundreds of different pages, simply [[for the lulz]]. But now... now [[Sock puppet|sockpuppetry]] has a new name, a master of the [[obvious|SUPAR SEKRIT]] alternate account. Enter the world of......

==Kitsune Youkai==
[[image:Kitsune Youkai irl.jpg|thumb|right|Patrick Sullivan with his [[whore|sister]]]]
{{Furaffinity|kitsuneyoukai}} (AKA [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/firecat Firecat] Patrick Sullivan) is a 20 year old furfag from Lake City Florida. He is [[circlejerk|recognized]] by the [[furfags|furry fandom]] for his various comics and pics of him [[incest|fucking his sister.]] [[fact|He brags about this to everybody that he can as often as he can.]] The only problem with doing this is that his sister is actually a fox plushie in his room. He has been living out the [[lie]] that he has a sister for four years, fooling the 2400ish furs on his watchlist. Kitsune joined the furry fandom when he was [[underage b&|16]], [[speedycat|instantly]] [[spam|posting]] [[buttsex|comics]] [[Fan Art|of]] [[Inuyasha|Shippo and Kilala]] [[Yiff|fucking]]. Other comics that he has made are about [[Rule 34|Nall and Ruby from Lunar: Eternal blue]], [[agnph|some guy fucking a floatzel]] and of course his foxy version of himself with his [[Plushie|sister.]]

Kitsune Youkai has had two previous [[Marriage|mates]] that he has had copious amounts of [[buttsecks]] with, along with his current true [[love]]. However, he is completely [[not gay]], since he only [[yiff]]s his [[plushie|sister]]. These furfags would be [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/zshimada/ Zero Shimada] and [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/foxonthefur/ Foxon]. There was a HUEG pile of furfaggotry that went down from this pseudo love triangle, resulting in Foxon being reduced to a quivering pile of [[butthurt]] and [[emo]] and Zero threatening to [[suicide]] for a few months, eventually going back to being generically [[emo]] afterwards. A detailed though somewhat misleading account of the entire ordeal can be seen below. 


==The Furfaggotry==
[[image:Zero Firecat bawww.jpg|thumb|right|Zero [[bawwwww]]ing about being dumped by a sockpuppet]]
When reading, keep in mind that Firecat is actually Kitsune Youkai, and Zero knew that Firecat was fake. That's right kids, '''[[LOL WUT|Zero threatened to kill himself because a sockpuppet character that he knew was fake broke up with him!]]''' BAWWWWW!

[[TL;DR]]: Kitsune is manipulative, Foxon and Zero are just stupid

[http://pastebin.com/nZprmFCW Kitsune Youkai's furfaggotry, as written by Kitsune Youkai himself]

==Firecat==

Firecat is the name of Kitsune's fake sister. 'She' is supposed to be the younger sibling of the two. 'Her' [[FurAffinity]] account was created February 6, 2008 and comments can be seen on 'her' yiffstar which date back to "2 years ago". Its only activity on FurAffinity is sometimes commenting to shoutouts people have given her talkpage, faving [[shit|pictures]] that Kitsune has made and [[SUBTLE HINT ALERT::|disappearing for months at a time.]] The only submissions on Firecat's userpages are those that were made for the fake account by Kitsune himself.

Firecat can also be seen sometimes playing on the private [[World of Warcraft]] server that Kitsune is hosting. They have been seen running instances together at the same time, however, Kitsune has admitted to having a [[hax|bot]] program to automatically play cat.

Firecat can also be seen at their house in [[Second Life]], where all of their [[Fantards|adoring fans]] flock to [[yiff|pay respects]] to the [[closet|happy]] [[emo|couple.]]

It is worth noting that Kitsune says that they are full blood siblings, and not step-brother/sister. 

It is also worth noting that '''<u>Firecat is not Christine Padovan.</u>''' This was the result of [[newfag|jumping to conclusions]]. Christine Padovan is completely unrelated to Kitsune's furfaggotry.

==[[Phoenix Wright|Evidence]]==

The sheer amount of [[proof]] that shows that Firecat is fake is only rivaled by how [[duh|obvious]] most of it is. So far, three of his past [[NOT GAY|male]] [[love]]rs have all admitted that Firecat is fake, '''Along with his own brother [[IRL]].''' Foxon can be seen [[bitch|bitching]] that Firecat isn't real on [[yiffstar]], and at one time FurAffinity before the mods [[banhammer|persuaded him]] otherwise. Zero has admitted on many an occasion that Firecat is fake. Another [[furfag|furry]] that says that cat is fake is Twilight, a yoshi [[man|girl]], who is briefly mentioned at the beginning of Kitsune's account of his [[Furfaggotry|love rhombus]].

[[Image:Kitsune Youkai's brother.jpg|thumb|right| Kitsune's brother admitting there is no sister]]

In addition, There is the [[obvious|subtle]] [[fact|hints]] that are strewn about. These include but are not limited to:
*Kitsune has never given an [[Powerword|IRL name]] for his [[plushie|sister]].
*Firecat [[Never|rarely]] goes online, and even when she does it's about something to do with Kitsune
*The only [[pr0n|pictures]] on her Fag Affinity page are those made by Kitsune
*When both Kitsune and Firecat are in the same online chat, they are never seen [[retard|typing at the same time]]
*Kitsune has admitted to having a bot on World of Warcraft to automatically play Firecat. He has been known to [[fact|suddenly stop moving every time Firecat says anything, then start moving again once her message has been posted]]
*Firecat's YIM cannot receive buzzes, file transfers or do group chats. This is ''obviously'' because [[lie|her Yahoo! is broken]] and not because [[truth|Kitsune just made an alternate email account and is using the online email chat since you can't have more than one Yahoo! instant messenger chat open on one computer at a time.]]
*The only proof that he has shown that his sister exists is a [[shitty|small]] [[shoop|low res]] pic that he posted on [[christmas|annual superjew day]] 2009.

==[[all caps|I'M ON ED?!?!?!?!1]]==

By his own means, kitsune has realized that he has his own little corner of ED, the eternal monument to his douchefaggotry. His initial response was "being [[denial|happy]] he's considered [[retarded|important]] enough to warrent one". However, upon it's debut as [[AOTN]], his FA was spammed with [[at least 100]] flamey messages from pissed off [[anon|anon's]] and [[furfags]] alike. He went emo and drew this, still completely oblivious as to why ANYBODY could possibly be pissed off at him for the lie that he's been forcing on [[furries]] for the last 4 years. He still blames everybody but himself and has no idea why the internet is [[internet hate machine|so mean]]. If he put half as much effort into getting a [[irl|real]] girlfriend as he did being a [[sockpuppet|sockpuppeting]] [[bawww|bawfag]], this entire page could have been avoided.

[[image:Yiffed in hell.jpg|center|I don't understand why everybody that I've been manipulating and lying to for years called me a stupid liar on the innernets!]]

===Other [[raeg]]===
Oddly enough, kitsune wasn't the only one to be pissed off at the fact that he's got an ED article. [[Foxon]], when finding out that this page existed, raged not over the fact that he was called the [[retarded]] [[sockpuppet]] [[cyber|cybering]] [[emo]] [[sheeple]] that he was, but because kitsune would suddenly reach levels of [[Brandon Crisp|internet fame]] magically overnight. Foxon's [[butthurt]] from being [[ignored|baleeted from kitsune's friendslist]] has not diminished, but rather taken [[zerg|deep root and manifested]] itself over the years within his psyche, forming a [[smoking|hazy miasma]] over all thought processes whenever kitsune's name is mentioned. <strike>Obviously Foxon's just jealous that he dosen't have a page of his own.</strike> [[foxon|LOL JAY KAY HE DOES NOW BITCH]]
