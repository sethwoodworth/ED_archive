'''Bcc''' is short for '''blind carbon copy''' and is primarily <i>supposed</i> to be used when sending [[email]] to a large number of your friends or contacts so that the [[spam|message]] is received without revealing everyone's email addresses to dozens of random strangers. A message sent successfully in '''Bcc''' mode will only reveal the sender's email address.

==Drama==

Failure to use '''Bcc''' in the appropriate situations is a common mistake amongst Internets [[nubs]] and a sure-fire [[drama-generating technique]]. Failing to Bcc is the leading cause of [[nerd rage]] and [[butthurt]] to seasoned [[Internets]] users who will usually respond by personally [[flaming]] the sender for being a [[lrn2|newbie faggot]] in reply or publicly respond in turn by sending a message flaming said faggot in [[everyone|'''reply all''']] mode so that everyone can mock the loser.

==The Upside==
By [[harvest|saving]] dozens of email addresses you never had, you can pad your address book with victims for your own spam messages. If you are unlucky enough to know somebody semi-famous, you can often pick up the personal email addresses of bona fide celebrities for your stalking pleasure.

==Trolling==
Any group of any given person's friends is going to be a diverse bunch including people of different races, religions and political affiliations. Since many group emailings are going to be sent to the sender's entire address book -regardless of the demographics- it's pretty much unavoidable that common group emails such as petitions and political material are going to end up with unsympathetic recipients. Thus, [[trolling]] for butthurt can be easy pickings. 

By hitting '''reply all''' to a message that has not been sent out in '''Bcc''' mode, it's fairly easy to set off a shitstorm of other '''reply all''' missives as some fucktard in the group will get their panties bunched and feel the need to feed the troll. Insulting politicians, religious beliefs and/or causes that the emailer is shilling for are always good for the win in these situations, as is [[buzzkill|killing the emailer's buzz]] via publicly shaming by replying to all with a [[Snopes]] link debunking their [[virus]] warning or '''''PLEASE FORWARD THIS MISSING GIRL'S PICTURE''''' bullshit.
