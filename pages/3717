"'''Hipsters'''" are elusive creatures who will never [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/extreme-fear/201009/the-sad-science-hipsterism admit to being hipster.] They can be found in great numbers, centralized in urbanized areas such as [[Jew York City]]. There are several breeds of <s>douchebag</s> hipster including, but not limited to, the art fag, indie fag, and most obscure of all, the [[wut|Avant-Garde]] fag. Hipsters rarely breed with those not in their subculture, leading to incestuous deformities including gaping holes in their ears and the  inability to distinguish color.

Devoted to anything hip, hipsters are obsessed with [[Gay|art]], [[ugly|fashion]], [[faggotry|music]], [[Apple]] [[shit|products]], and [[Unwarranted self-importance|indie flicks]]. Because hipness is inversely proportional to notoriety and popularity, the hipster's interests are fleeting and every six months it will throw out all of its collections. 

You will first notice the perfume of a hipster, a distinct and elusive scent of Parliament cigarettes and Palm Breeze, with a  hint of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Alternatively, they may smell of Gauloise Blones cigarettes, Djarum Cloves, Camels, Lucky Strikes and, in vegan breeds, American Spirits. Mainstream cigarettes such as [[White Trash|Marlboros]] and [[niggers|Newports]] are unpopular among this species due to their lack of marketing to children.

Hipsters are rarely aware of their condition and may shun others of their breed. [[irony|"Look at all the dumb fuck hipsters in here"]] is a common mating call of the hipster dialect.

tl;dr--A hipster is someone who tries to be as different form possible from everyone as they can, in a constant fight to be "hip" and "edgy". Everybody who isn't a fucking retard knows what a hipster is and only morons use the word to describe people who aren't hipsters. In fact, it seems the only people not capable of understanding what a hipster is are other hipsters.

==A Comprehensive List of Hipster Genus==
[[Image:Hipster_by_pashion.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[DESU|NEEDS MOAR SUNGLASSES]]]]

===Typical Hipster===
*The typical hipster is generally an unemployed, angry, self-loathing faggot in his late teens to early twenties. May openly claim to be trying to [[ghey|"discover his place in life."]]
*Many will claim to have lots of enemies and no close friends due to being "misunderstood." Be warned, this is merely a ploy to gain sympathy. Those not familiar with the culture will come to discover very quickly that most don't particularly enjoy the company of your typical hipster because he is an angst-ridden, narcissistic douchebag who bitches and moans about as much as your 13-year old sister.
*It will insist that you are a conformist for any variety of reasons. It will go as far to insinuate every living being on the planet is a conformist, the exception being himself.
*It may openly claim to dislike the hippie culture. This is hilariously ironic, as hippies are incredibly dirty and your typical hipster dresses like a homeless person, frequently carries an STD and rarely showers.
*It will have gone through several fads in high school before having settled on hipster. These may include, but are not limited to [[punk]], [[scene]], [[emo]] and [[goth]].
*It does not have a concentrated attention span, and its interests are evenly distributed in the avant garde, hip art, music, fashion, etc. 
*[[ghey|It may carry an appreciation for European culture.]]
*It holds an odd fascination for really bad, cult indie films. Tommy Wiseau's "The Room" is no exception, ever. [[Truth|Seriously, this movie is like the Napoleon Dynamite of the hipster culture. Every fucking hipster and their grandmother quotes this shit endlessly.]]
*It may dress decadently, but not as overly indulgent and gay as the '''avant garde''' hipster. 
*It will only listen to [[shit|bands you've never heard of]]. If non-hipsters ever adopt this music, they will quickly lose interest
*It enjoys art and literature, but doesn't know fuck all about how to create either.
*It may claim to be an anarchist, nihilist or existentialist, but knows little to fuck all regarding the ideals behind any of aforementioned movements.
* [[Ghey|Loafers]] are the designated footwear of [[fake|hipster fashion]]. The loafers indicate that the hipster has successfully [[rape|courted]] and stolen from an [[elderly]] man, retrieving their loafers as a prize.
*It must use aviator or Ray Ban knockoffs and other massive glasses to block out the sun 
*It rides a "fixie" [[bike]], i.e. a bike that can't coast and has no brakes, because conventional bikes and cars are too mainstream. May endlessly attempt to pound the notion into others that [[lies|"he had a fixie before they were cool."]]
*It may express a sense of "ironic" enjoyment for bad '80s bands and unfashionable clothing, but it secretly actually likes some of that shit. 
*If by some miracle it managed to get accepted into a university, it will most likely be found studying [[Shit nobody cares about|English, Philosophy, History, A Foreign Language, Graphic Design and various other concentrations in Art.]]
*It will always own an iPhone and other various Apple products. In fact, the majority of people who work in Mac Stores or for Apple tech support are in fact, hipsters.
*It is essentially a walking stereotype and due to this will carry with it no trace of a genuine personality or intellect outside of aforesaid traits.
*As a new trend of 2011, Hipsters of all kind just have to have a sort of [[fetish|fascination]] with the Galaxy/Space. But sadly enough, Hipsters don't have enough knowledge on why they like it. They only do because [[lies|they like for its pretty colors, its oh-so-originality, and to try to hide the fact that they are all the same damn stereo-type]].
*It always have to associate itself with its obsession with TRAINGLES. Probably from playing ''The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess'' way too often.
 ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ ▲ !!!!!!
*Like every typical Hipster on either its [[Tumblr]] or [[Deviantart]] profile, most of its pictures always have to contain either [[shit|traingles]] or [[poser|space]]

===Indie Fag=== 
*Generally like any shitty band as long as they dress in the correct way.  Pretend to have a deep understanding of music but generally are just talking out of their ass.  Occasionally they actually like good bands and drive sane people away from those particular bands.

*They are the most badly dressed of the bunch and can be easily identified. Both sexes have the tendency to wear button up shirts, straight legged pants, a hoodie, and some type of flat bottomed shoe. If born a girl,  it may wear flats and a sweater. Sometimes it is difficult to tell indie boys and girls apart because they were born so much alike. 

*The Indie fag is just the remains of what hipsters ''used'' to look like. But despite their refusal to evolve they are still accepted as a part of the hipster community. They listen to all the [[shit|coolest and most subversive]] music that you have never heard of. And if you have heard of them... well.. they heard them first. 

*Indie fags are the most likely to [[Prostatot|smoke pole at 13]]. They own records and more than a dozen Kurt Vonnegut novels. Any obscure old work of literature is bookmarked on wikipedia.

*Indie fags of both sexes like to grow sideburns and beards.

===Avant-Garde===
Avant Garde hipsters specialize in fashion. They are wear the most outrageous costumes but pretend that they did not spend 5 hours preparing their outfit the night before. Whatever is in, they wore it before it was. 

They tend to be obsessed with finding the new.  They remain elusive because their fashion changes every five seconds, but they are the person that looks the most ridiculous. And if THAT is ridiculous, you are just an unfashionable dolt. Their music taste is always current, hip, and leans towards the indie, electronic, new wave, and post-punk, or whatever noise their favourite DJ made when he passed out onto his keyboard. 

A notable avant-garde hipster is It-Girl [[Cory Kennedy]]. The best place to keep track of hipster fashion is [http://www.latfh.com/ here].

===Shoreditch Twat===

This is a specific genus of [[British]] hipster. Like American hipsters, the British hipster will own every single Apple product released(including the special edition [[Steve Jobs]] shaped buttplug), listen to only the most ironic/obscure fax machine samples for music and smoke only the coolest/obscure/ironic cigarettes known to man (subject to availability in U.K, these are Marboro lights or Camels).

Typically new-media/digital/art graduates (funded by their parents for the most part), the Shoreditch Twat will use plenty of seemingly meaningful words (like "paradigm" or "dynamic"), however, upon closer scrutiny, these mumblings can be exposed to be as empty and as vacuous as the person uttering them. 

What differs between the standard UK hipster and the Shoreditch Twat is generally considered to be the location of the hipster i.e the Shoreditch Twat works/lives in Shoreditch, [[London]]. 

"The Shoreditch Twat" was initially a fanzine set up by a night club promoter (a [[idiot|Twat]] magazine for his Twatty clientelle-how ironic/awesome) but the concept was brought to the wider public attention by satirist Charlie Brooker in his spoof TVguide listing website TVgohome, appearing as a "listing" simply titled "[http://thegestalt.org/simon/cunt/ CUNT]".

This fictional Tv listing was later made into the TV show "[[Chris_Morris#Nathan_Barley|Nathan Barley]]" with the aid of legendary [[troll]] producer and writer [[Chris Morris]].

===Debatable Teenage Hipster===
The Debatable Teenager Hipster isn't a real hipster since technically hipsters don't exist until after high school (here they failed at being a [[pretty cool guy]]). Unless it's a 18 year old or 21 year old in high school from flunking those years from getting stoned and being the drunkard, they are usually living off parent's money. In fact, they are worse than Hipsters. They're [[Fail|wannabe-hipsters]]. 

These wannabe-hipsters exist mostly in suburbs where they found out about hipsters on the internet and thought oh so [[cute]]. They usually have a [[Tumblr]], where they post shitty pics and have other shitty wannabe friends with whom they engage in regular [[Circle jerk|circle jerks]]. These faggots are also 'photographers', which means they made their parents buy them a $800 DSLR and took a photo of their street. All Wannabes will even admit to being hipster, proving that they are not hipsters, as real hipsters would never do that. Having [[Slut|Lady Gaga]] and [[Slut|Kesha]] as favorite artists while calling yourself a hipster somehow doesn't seem ironic to them. Should the following be said you know you have a [[faggot]].

* '''OMG! I'm such a hipster!!!'''
* '''Look at MY hipster clothes!'''
* '''I should've been born in the city. There's more intellectuals like me.'''

In fact, even mentioning the word hipster and claiming to be one makes you a wannabe.

Really dumb people and people with raging levels of not-with-it-ness will confuse the DTH/adult scenecore faggot with the hipster. This is false, and a great way to spot an avowed non-hipster. Did they just refer to the girl with the raccoon eyeshadow, pink hair, and platform fuck-me boots as a "hipster"? WEE-OOH, WEE-OHH: NORP identified.

===Simple Guide: Hipster Shore===

==Behavioral Patterns of the Hipster Species==
[[Image:Hypsteriphone.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Suburban hipster (Note the iPhone and Guitar Hero controllers)]]
# '''The "Hip" which can be named is not the true "Hip".''' Many ascetic religions seek a life of simplicity. "Hipsters" seek a life of obscurity. The great vessel of their obscurity is the "hip". <br /><br />As they fall deeper and deeper into the "hip", they find themselves further away from the accursed "unhipness" of the mainstream. Once  engulfed in the "hip," they begin to sink further away from the mainstream and still further away from the "hippest" in the scene. In this descent, the "hipster" may begin mumbling akin to the Pentecostal church's speaking in tongues. <br /><br />The mumbling is what happens in towards the final stages of the hipster baptism as they begin to discover bands so "hip" and obscure that they don't yet know if they are bands yet. There are no words in all but the most obscure dialects to describe music that imaginary bands make, so the hipster begins to mumble, or only pretend to speak.
# '''All personal labels are considered "unhip" and the great "hip" ones will not abide by any such labels.''' <br /><br />Hipsters, though they know full well that they are "hip", will never answer to "hipster" and will refuse the word "hip". They are known to speak in a "hip" pseudo-language combining actual words, cliche portmanteaus, and [[shit nobody cares about|shit they just made up]]. The "Hipster Handbook", an expose on the "hipster" lifestyle says '''"What was once cool, now is deck"'''. ''Deck'' means "cool" to other hipsters, as it is ''fin'' or "uncool" to say cool. These are now outdated, and to say such common hipster phrases is decidedly base.
#The "Hipster"'s lifestyle is shrouded in a mystical rhetorical substance known as '''"irony"'''. <br /><br />It is said that hipness manifests in areas with the most irony. As a difficult concept to understand, perceiving irony requires hipness in itself. Irony can also be perceived and created out of the unhip. Whatever the irony, once perceived by the hipster it must be decoded for [[Gov.palin@yahoo.com|hidden messages]] and take the prophecies of the great hip to heart. <br /><br />'''If you see a "hipster" lethargic on the couch watching "Gillian's Island", this is what he is trying to do.'''
# '''Remember:''' "Bisexual" is the new "I'm so drunk!"

===Hipster Lifestyle===
[[Image:KillHipster.png|thumb|right|150px|How to kill a Hipster.]]
They show their devotion by listening to [[batshit insane|Guided by Voices]] for hours on end, and are harmless until engaged in a discussion on music. They can become violent once induced in a music trance, so be sure to satiate them by putting on a copy of [[Shit|Pavement's beloved album '''Slanted and Enchanted''']].  Once they have calmed down, turn off the music and kick them out of your apartment as fast as you can.

<s>Consult the Hipster Handbook</s> There is nothing you can do to protect yourself when engaging hipsters in discussions, as they have perfect memory your musical tastes. You will need to convince them that you were only being momentarily [[ironic]] in stating that "[[Shit bands|Linkin Park]] isn't too bad." "Hipsters" themselves claim this with ''[[American Idol]]'' performers.

To get hipster [[pussy]] or [[cock]], you must start an [[indie]] rock band, have access to at least a keybump of [[cocaine]], and backstage passes to any [[Canadia|Of Montreal]], Fleet Foxes, or <s>American Football</s> [[Furry|Animal Collective]] concert. Hipsters devote their young adult lives to overcompensating for any [[Dungeons & Dragons|social failures]] of their first eighteen years, and therefore find it nigh impossible to pass on any offer of sex.  

Hipster chicks occasionally engage in [[Hipster Grifter|grifting]], which is a fancy way of saying that she just robbed you, bitch.

===Hipster Relationships===

It is a common understanding that hipster relationships do not last long as they have yet to discover love. Monogamy is a ludicrous and dreaded as an unhip concept. The hipstyle, a term for the lifestyle of the hipster, is to date as many fellow hipsters as possible before thirty-five, upon which they simply disappear completely.

===[[Hipster]] Irony===
[[Image:IRONY!!!.JPG|thumb|right|150px|This woman actually enjoys Darkwing Duck, but pretends to be wearing this shirt "ironically".]]
The fourth definition of irony is perhaps the most complex, and is frequently used by [[emo]] kids, though often they are not aware of this fact. '''[[you|Hipster]] Irony''', as it is called, determines irony as being a self-awareness of one's behavior, insofar as that behavior is incongruent with what is expected and what actually occurs. An example can be seen [http://www.cryingwhileeating.com/ here]. Irony is thus ''self-awareness of irony'', under this definition. It is only thanks to this latter type of irony that the emo and hipster [[scene]]s are considered in any way cool (ironically enough, only by other [[Retard|emos, hipsters]] and Jew), and not just another branch of [[geek]]dom. 

For example: a person who wears, say, a ''Legend of Zelda'' t-shirt, but who does it ironically in the hipster sense, is being self-aware of the irony of their situation — they are in essence saying "[[Man]], isn't it so ironic that someone as cool as me would wear such a geeky shirt?" Thus it is that emo kids and hipsters get away with wearing and participating in a lot of what is otherwise considered "fringe" or uncool behavior.

The selection of the correct tee or fashion item with the highest level of irony is a complex process. Irony is a byproduct produced by careful aging of once-popular things, products, or ideas. Much as a can of grape drink, given time and yeast, will become a fine [[wine]], a popular idea allowed to wallow into obscurity can become rich in ironic value. Much as a trained pig can find truffles, a hipster can smell irony in an [[old]] thing and make it cool. The irony-aging process can take months or years. For example [[furry|Thundercats]] was popular in 1983, by 1988 was passé, and by 1994, virtually unknown. By 2004 they were obscure enough that wearing a [[Furry|Thundercats]] printed tee is ironic and hence "cool".

[[Truth|Anyone who participates in hipster irony is actually not cool at all]]. This means that they are actually the victims of traditional irony. [[Obvious|Which is ironic.]]

Another example of [[Hipster]]-[[france|esque]] Irony are men's pink shirts.  [[Hipsters]] believe that wearing a [[pussy|pink]] shirt expresses how comfortable they are with their [[homo|sexuality]], when in fact pink is a [[feminine]] color.  So by expressing their sexual stability, they aim to insinuate manliness.  It then becomes ironic that they are insinuating manliness through the color pink.  [[Fact|But of course no manliness is expressed because all Hipsters are fags]].

==Vice Magazine==

If you want to be a hipster, here's the how-to guidebook. Since they get all of their information off of Google, there's nothing in there that you didn't already know, but it'll give you the lowdown on how to be a [[douchebag|hipster]]. Since nobody told them that nobody reads [[wall of text|Tl;dr]], their articles are always tl;dr. Don't even bother trying to read one. Instead, go right to the Do's and Don'ts' page and click every single picture until you find something [[funny]].<s>gtfo, no one has read vice in years. a lot of the dumber ones migrated over to cobrasnake (but even that's kind of disreputable and passe). the smart ones started their own tumblrs and are currently awaiting book and/or movie deals.</s>'''DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS!'''

==American Apparel==
[[Image:Realnerds.gif|thumb|right|150px|Hipsters are stealing nerd culture and making it "ironic".]]

The temple of hipster, specializing in plain clothing, in every color under the sun because it is [[fact|the pinnacle of hipness to own a t-shirt in fifty different colors]].

Their side-operation is hiring ugly girls for [[The_Boss|Dov Charney]] to fuck. The models in their advertisements are all [[IRL]] salespersons. You can be sure of that, because professional models are never that buttfuck ugly. This is just fine for Dov Charney, because fucking girls uglier than him hardens his dick.

When searching Dov Charney you will find article upon article [[Rimjob|laving his butthole]] by talking about how sexually charged his ad campaign and general store layout is. You will also find articles about how he is now going broke. If ugly chicks in a minamalist-furnished storefront is sexy, a sex therapist may be called for, instead of another bottle of viagra.

Not surprisingly, shirts sold from [http://shop.encyclopediadramatica.com/ The ED TShirt Shop] use American Apparel.

==Hipster Bars==
Hipsters love to cram themselves into downtown bars that sell Pabst or Miller High Life for double what it costs at the corner store. They can be seen holding their piss beer by their chests while awkwardly interacting with each other. Human interaction is nearly impossible in a hipster bar because the required loudness of the music is 194db. Hipsters actually like this because they have nothing to say anyway. The music is either obscure indie faggotry or a "mashup" that may contain elements of songs you like, but will be layered over four songs you hate. Severe ADHD is required to properly enjoy a mashup.

==The Cure==
If you or anyone you know are mutating in to the hipster, the first course of action is accepting what you or they have become. The second is to [[genocide|kill yourself and all of your new friends.]] This will assist the rest of society in engaging the species when their ironic methods become a threat to us all.
