The SEGA Dreamcast was SEGA's final foray into the hardware business. Released on [[Last Thursday]] and ultimately pwnt by SONY, the console is remembered as that one console that everybody vaguely remembers, but forgets seconds later. To give it some credit, though, it did live up to its name: you would dream as you would fall asleep playing it because of how fucking boring it was and it would cast [[nothing|some of the best games of all time]].

==History==
Realizing the deep shit they had gotten themselves into because of the SEGA SATURN (it's a long story), SEGA attempted to redeem themselves by releasing a nextgen console that kick the balls out of the Nintendo 64 and SONY PlayStation. After a faggy codename phase, the console was given the name Dreamcast (as well as a pointless Windows CE from Microsoft. Yes, this console could browse the internet. Shame nobody did that on it though) and upon release, it was financial success...

... for a couple of fucking months. SONY pulled out the PS2 and managed to sway most of the consumers away with its super advanced "[[all caps|DVD PLAYER]]", as well as the Sony of [[God]]'s support from EA and Squaresoft. SEGA faced massive pwnage and would drop out of the hardware business, becoming [[n00bs|third party developers]]. Isao Okawa (former SEGA chairman and infamously known as the dumbshit that made the bet that the Dreamcast would succeed) and many SEGA fans responded by [[an hero|having the final dream of their lives]]. According to some [[fanboys|people]], the dream will live on, even though everybody knows that they're all playing XBOX or some shit nowadays.

==Memorable Games==
[[Image:Dreamcastlol.jpg|thumb|Dreamcast, Semen Face, Whats-His-Face, and Bitch Face charge into battle.]]
''NOTE: [[LMAO|Most of these games have been released on several, unrelated consoles.]]''<br />
''<b>Crazy Taxi</b>'' - This CRAAAAAAAAAZY game was known for making being a taxi driver more badass than it was [[IRL]].<br />
''<b>Phantasy Star Online</b>'' - It's an MMORPG ... ON A CONSOLE. <br />
''<b>Jet Grind (or Set) Radio</b>'' - Ever wanted to spray ''gayffiti'', while somehow [[insane|dodging cops, armed paratroopers, crazy assassins, and tanks]]? Now you can! <br />
''<b>Samba De Amigo</b>'' - A game with [[racism|monkeys, maracas, and mexicans]].<br />
''<b>SEGA <s>B</s>ass Fishing</b>'' - The world's first fishing game (mainly because nobody fishes IRL).<br />
''<b>SEGA Sports Games</b>'' - SEGA's answer to EA Sports. (Note: There is no difference between them)<br />
''<b>Semen</b>'' - You talk to this fish guy through a microphone, you're an asshole. That's just about it.<br />
''<b>Shenmue</b>'' - You play as this dude whose father was killed and won't move on with his life until he finds [[Buttsecks|closure]].<br />
''<b>Skies of Arcadia</b>'' - An RPG ... WITH PIRATES!<br />
''<b>Sonic Adventure 1 & 2</b>'' - The last Sonic games anybody really was forced to buy and the last to not ''completely'' suck.<br />
''<b>Sonic Shuffle</b>'' - Some lame Mario Party ripoff that nobody cared about. It is impossible to win in this game.  <br />
''<b>Space Channel 5</b>'' - Earth is being invaded by fat neckbeards and you must dance to stop them. There was also a Michael Jackson cameo somewhere.<br />

There was also a selection of thirdparty games such as SoulCalibur, Marvel vs. Capcom, and PowerStone, but most of those are on XBOXLIVE or some shit so nobody cares.

==Fanbase==
[[Image:Dreamcast2.jpg|thumb|What is it with Japan and [[loli]] [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:360tankx6.jpg console drawings?] ]]
The Sega Dreamcast fanbase will have you believe that they are smart, sophisticated, and seasoned gamers, but really encompass some of the more retarded [[fanboy]]s. Not quite as bad as the Xbox 360's fanbase mind you, but still pretty bad. 

They constantly send Sega angry email letters asking them why they haven't made the Dreamcast 2 yet and also make bullshit statements on how the Dreamcast 2 would do well today, obviously forgetting that the gaming market has been overrun by casual gamers who play nothing but [[Call of Duty 4]], [[Guitar Hero]], [[Halo]], Madden, and the [[Wii]]. They also love to brag that they bought their Dreamcast on 9/9/99 (day 1 in the [[USA]]) thinking that will give them [[penis]] cred. When Sega announces that they are remaking a classic Dreamcast game, they drink massive amounts of [[booze|Red Bull]] and go on a destructive Internets rampage to celebrate. They then buy the game, realize it sucks in its new debased form, throw fits, and go on an angry rampage, stupid [[sarcasm|because this obviously wasn't the first time Sega has debased a good game]].

==IGN Trolls Dreamcast Fans==
In A.D. 2006, war was beginning. [[IGN]] created a mysterious new blog called [http://blogs.ign.com/Dreamcast2-IGN Dreamcast 2]. On it, they made blog posts hinting that there would be a second Dreamcast. The blog eventually became popular near the end of the year due to news coverage, and the blog itself managed to be pretty humorous. The blog said it was going to make an announcement a couple of months before the Dreamcast's anniversary. There was even a post about a "mysterious" package that was sent to them by the president of IGN Japan. The president of IGN Japan even left a comment on that post. All of this led the moar fannish Dreamcast fans everywhere to believe that there was [[Rly|rilly]] going to be a new Dreamcast. It turned out to be a cheap as hell promotion for the official reopening of the Dreamcast section on IGN, but still possibly one of IGN's best trollings, pissing off countless fanboys, including the writer of the original version of this article this time around.

Three years later after everyone forgot about this, IGN made a [http://games.ign.com/articles/102/1021451p1.html top 25 Dreamcast games] article on 9/9/2009, for the Dreamcast's 10th anniversary in North America. This list was perfectly reasonable, but for the sake of the [[lulz]], they left out the Sonic Adventure and Shenmue games. Adding fuel to the [[fanboy]]-[[flame]]s , they made a [[lame]] [[flame]]bait article [http://games.ign.com/articles/102/1023747p1.html where their staff dissed the games].

==Dreamcast VS. Wii==
[[Image:Dreamwii.jpg|thumb|NO GOD DAMMIT [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG]].]]

{{quote|Some Wii fanboys love to compare the Wii to the Dreamcast. They will go on about how the Wii is innovative and revolutionary in gaming, just like the Dreamcast was. They forget a major detail: hardcore vs. casual or even senile. The Wii is revolutionary, but it's just not elite. The Dreamcast was pretty much the diametrical opposite, even for 3rd party games ...|Some faggoty Dreamcast Fanboy}}

This is a retarded arguement used by Dreamcast [[weeaboo|fanboys]] to try to justify their obsession with a shitty console. 

The Wii was targeting casual gamer/old people, and succeeded, while the Dreamcast was targeting "hardcore" gamers, and got rejected and subsequently died. This means the the Wii, with it meager appeal to gamers, was still VASTLY more successful than the Dreamcast.

LOL

Some more points are demonstrated in this video, but unfortunately the guy who made it comes off as a combination of [[elitist]] [[faggot]], ignorant [[moron]], and [[Xbox]] fanboy.
