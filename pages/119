'''7 Proxies''' is a [[chan]] [[meme]] that originated from [[btard|people]] who [[h4x|hacked]] some [[16 year old girl|bitch's]] shit. They hacked her college [[Jew gold|financial assistance]] fund and then went through her computer, found [[porn|images and videos]] of her, and posted them. Being told they'd be  caught for hacking her college shit, she was met with this response:

{{quote|I WENT THROUGH 7 PROXIES<br>GOOD LUCK|Anonymous|Post #39511552}}

This meme has since become somewhat obscure, but is commonly used in an intimidating or sarcastic manner, or in discussion about online mischief requiring the use of [[proxy|proxies]].
