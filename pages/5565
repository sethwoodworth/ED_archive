'''[http://www.mylifeisaverage.com My Life is Average]''' '''(MLIA)''' is an [[unfunny]] sister website to [[FML]], the purpose being less about whining faggotry and more about ostensibly [[awesome]] events.  This site is only useful for emo kids to whine about how these things can never happen to them.  Like its sister site, many stories reek of being fake, and [[over 9000|at least 15]] stories have been shamelessly stolen from [[bash.org]].

Typical stories revolve around [[Harry Potter]] fags versus [[Twilight]] fags, rewordings of FML posts, and unusual things that teachers have done (proving that the posters are mostly [[16 year old girls]]). One of the bigger trends is lying about a family member or friend dying recently, but [[bullshit|always wanted to have a MLIA story posted before he/she died]], and can only achieve that dream if [[you]] vote for it to appear on the front page. 

According to [[TOW]], the stories are moderated, but the general level of maturity suggests that the [[mods]] are either asleep half the time or the same kids submitting this crap.

In addition to the aforementioned [[FML]], another similarly [[Lie|entertaining]] website is [http://www.mylifeisg.com My Life Is Good], where high school students engage in a [[circle jerk]] of how [[Fail|awesome]] their lives are.

== The Commenters ==

Like any other forum style website- the comments are segregated into [[over 9000|three]] groups. [[Gods|Regs]], [[you|normals]], [[trolls]], and [[n00bs]]. All of them (except the [[OP]] loving newfags are evil, spiteful bastards. They'll cuss you out in a heartbeat and provide sympathy if you are deemed a valuable member. If not, [[tits or gtfo]].
