Dragon Cave
[http://www.dragcave.net Dragon cave] is a conspiracy to glue all the [[16-year-old girl | Teenage Girls]] in the Internets to something other than their webcams run by a complete [[drama whore]] who goes by the name of Theodore J. Lipscomb (TJ).  Ok, so it's not really a [[The Game|game]] so much as it's really staring vacantly at a screen clicking madly while your soul is being sucked into the void, and TJ is not so much a moderator as the [[Mangina|Queen Twat]], but who's counting? 

====The Average Dragon Cave User====
[[Image:Sadpedobear.jpg|left|thumb|A heavy Dragon Cave user]]
Spotting a [[Zombie | Dragon Cave User]] is incredibly easy! 

* Glassy, vacant eyes
* Dry skin and overall poor hygiene [[Image:Typicaldcuser.png|right|thumb|A typical Dragon Cave user.]]
* Incredible [[retard|intelligence levels]]
* Membership to [[Noobs|Compulsive Poster's Anonymous (CPA)]] [[Image:Donthurtdragons.png|right|thumb|How DARE you harm pixels!]]
* Constant droning on and on about [[shit|very important Dragon Cave stuff]]
* Extreme protectiveness of said [[shit|Very important Dragon Cave stuff]]
* [[Female]] and/or [[Jailbait|Jailbait]]. If they claim to be older, they usually are [[loli|seven]].
* Very sad [[Pedobear]] shaking his head and crying nearby.
* Will freak out at the mention of harming pixels


[[Image:YellowSnow-DC.jpg|right|thumb|Yellow Snow- Dragon Cave's favorite treat!]]Elite Dragon Cave players have permanent [[PMS]]. Almost all of them have raging hardons for TJ and gladly suck his [[e-penis]] whenever he whips it out in front of them (which is frequently). They are even [[fucktard|Smarter]] than the normal Dragon Cave users and love to flaunt it at every single opportunity. Time not spent sucking E-Penis is spent roleplaying out [[Furfag|Awesome Dragon]] [[Mary Sue| Roleplay Characters]] notable for having zero physical descriptions and almost always the same personalities. 

The moderators are useless [[assburgers|Aspies]] noted for their [[special]] [[maturity]] levels and [[cunt|being total cunts]]. The loudest of them are notable [[Otherkin]] and are even more protective of the Dragon Cave bullshit than normal as they don't know the difference between [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|real dragons]] and shitty pixel art "dragons". Time not spent jerking it to [[furfag|Dragon "art"]] is spent bashing newbies into the ground for asking [[WTF]] is up with the total lack of information on how to play this game. God forbid someone let slip one of Dragon Cave's [[Bullshit|Awesome Secrets]]!

====Rules of Dragon Cave====
[[Image:Dragcave.png|right|thumb|What happens when you tell the Secretz]]
Dragon Cave operates under a strict code of silence. Anyone who so much as says a peep about the many secrets of the dragon cave will be [[Voraphile|eaten by T.J]]. Once any word is uttered about the many incredible secrets of Dragon Cave, the [[banhammer]] Comes down leading to [[lolicon|Loli Pancakes]] and lots of [[Baw]]wwwing.

Dragon Cave Players are encouraged to necro topics instead of creating new topics as, according to faux moderator Sabbita "[http://dragcaveforum.technoized.com/index.php?showtopic=26020 "It saves bandwidth"]. Apparently Bandwidth and server space are the same in Dragon Cave due to some [[Retard|quirk of computer physics]]. As a consequence, posting any thread, even if it only barely resembles a locked thread from three years ago, results in thread locking and possibly a big celebration concluded with the summoning of the [[Party Van]].

The Admins are also apparently [[hugbox|very fragile]] and possibly [[emo]]....
''If you have an issue with the site admin, take it to PMs. If you post it in the forums, everyone will jump into the thread, causing '''lag''' and stress and bad feelings, eventually resulting in the site admin '''feeling so worthless because everyone is insulting them that they just pack up and leave.'''''-- sabbita/Layn ([http://dragcaveforum.technoized.com/index.php?showtopic=26020 link here])

... so please, coddle the Admins. They NEED you! 

This place is just screaming to be trolled.

===TJ09: the Queen Twat===
If the game being a boring clickfest run by overprotective commies who are so afraid that you'll figure out water dragons hatch from blue eggs wasn't enough, behold the trainwreck that is TJ09- the Queen Twat and creator of this atrocity.

"TJ09", AKA [http://dragcave.net/ T.J. Lipscomb], is a 17-year old from Shelton, Connecticut with a massive yet amazingly fragile ego. Most likely he is a [[furfag]], [[otherkin]] and most likely secretly a [[cuntboy]]. TJ's hobbies include stealing shitty pixel art from videogames, getting nailed for stealing shitty pixel art from videogames, [[Pedophilia|seducing teenage girls]] into making him shitty replacement art, and throwing tantrums when others don't do exactly as he says.

====How to Treat your Users====
[[Image:TJname.PNG|thumb|right|All those eggs mean he's "[[asspie|special]]"]]
One day in the fall of 2008 the teenage girls got sick and tired of the Admins' trigger-happy banhammer and censorship of even the most basic aspects of play and decided to make a thread called [http://dragcaveforum.technoized.com/index.php?showtopic=26015 How To Treat your Users] with the hopes that TJ would mend his [[stupid|evil]] ways. The resulting emo comments and flamestorm reached a category five on the [[lulz]] scale. Here are a few choice excerpts from the horse's mouth.

'You know what? You're right. Clearly I cannot handle both what is going on in life right now without having my stress roll over into how I act on this forum. So instead, I'll abstain from visiting this forum until things calm down to the point where I can actually deal with people in a polite manner.''--TJ09 @ Nov 5 2008, 05:09 PM

''People. I did not post here to be a drama queen and attract everyone's pity. The OP has valid points, so stop flaming them. '' --TJ09 @ Nov 5 2008, 06:06 PM

The Site Admin TJ09 (T.J. Lipscomb) changed his title to '''Clearly too rude for this forum''' after locking the thread.

[[Image:TJ09support.png |thumb|left|Mark of a butthurt fangirl]][http://dragcaveforum.technoized.com/index.php?showtopic=26030 A great big Bawwwww] rose out of the forums after the How to Treat your Users thread was locked with all the girls scared that TJ had left the site 4EVA!!! Dozens of members started sporting "I support TJ" buttons and banners while bawwing extra loud at everyone who suggested that Mayyybe TJ was wrong and that maybe he needed to grow a pair and stop being such a [[twat]]. Dozens of "we support TJ", "We Love TJ" and "please come [[loli|screw]] us TJ!" threads cropped up, spamming out all notable content from the forums in most sections of the site. A few users pledged to leave the forums as well in honor of TJ's leaving the forums. 

Though everyone hoped they would not return, most never left and neither did TJ. Instead he instead began lurking instead of moderating his own forums leading to massive spam and after listening to butthurt fangirls crying over him supposedly leaving the site 4EVA!! he posted a news post called "Uhou Idcesbot!"

====Uhou Idcesbot!====
[[Image:UhouIdcesbot.jpg|thumb|right|Asshattery in Furfag-speak]] What started as a [http://dragcaveforum.technoized.com/index.php?showtopic=28013 news post] in [[furfag|Saurian]] (no shit, TJ is so lame he makes announcements in the language from the [[furfag|Starfox]] games) became a rant fest of epic proportions once someone found a [[IRL|Real Life]] picture of TJ and posted it. TJ saw this, panicked and wiped the thread to try to remove all traces. He then proceeded to show how much more mature than the rest of the forum he is....

Translation:
''Well aren't you all reaaaaaaaaaaaaal mature. srsoy. Break my forum... psh.''

''By the, this topic is far from record-setting. News topics have gotten to 2YY pages before.''

This had absolutely nothing to do with the initial post into which the new "anouncement" was edited and everything to do with the fact that apparently the Dragon Cave forums handle [[popular|massive numbers of posts]] about as well as TJ handles his users. The display of asshattery and wiping the thread of all posts did not stem the tide of posts, however, and the thread was up to over 200 posts and rising within 20 minutes of the wipe, many of which basically could be summarized as [[Stfu]]. Feeling butthurt that his cry for attention and attempt to cover-up his ugly mug [[fail|failed]] to pan out as intended, TJ wiped the thread a second time, locking it, and completely shut down the forums. When the forums came back up online the above image had been [[deleted]].


=faux mod Sabbita/Layn=
[[Image:NotSabbita.JPG|left|thumb|100 px|Not Sabbita]]
A [[unwarranted self importance| self-important]] [[loli|12 year-old girl]] who likes to think she is not only a moderator but [[Epic Fail|good at computers]]. After this article was found she changed her screenname to "Layn" to try to [[fail|throw off]] the [[trolls]]. This [[no|might have worked]] if she didn't keep the same avatar, attitude, posting style, [[Delete fucking everything|deleted]] every single one of her 5,000+ posts and [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|burned]] her Dragon Cave scroll. In fact, [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:DCTrolls.jpg using a picture of herself as her avatar] didn't help.

Her main claim to fame is being even more [[paranoid]] and [[anal]] than 50 Elite Dragon Cave users combined! She flits around the forum to spew her opinion everywhere and actually think it means something, when really what most of the kids is roll their eyes and skip her posts.  Newbies think she's a mod. TJ's fangirls think she's a god. The rest of us think she needs to [[STFU|Shut the fuck up]].

When not being a [[drama whore]], Sabbita is busily churning out nauseatingly-bad dragon "sprites". She likes to [[BAWW|whine]] when it looks like her sprites are not the favorites in a thread because she's so [[hugbox|special]]. 
 
She also likes vandalizing this article with the [[fail|very clever]] alternate name of  [[User:Magicdragon|Magicdragon on ED]].

===Sabbita 2.0: Crazywargod===

[[Image:Crazyy.png|left|thumb|So [[lame|wise]], I'm gonna quote [[fucktard|myself]]!]]Crazywargod is like Sabbita/Layn 2.0. More [[butthurt|helpful]] and annoying than ever, crazywargod seems to think he is a mod and therefore has the [[BAWWW|authority]] to tell people when to shut up, continuing to attempt to get in the last word himself, however [[retard|unreadable]] those "last words" may be.

Often seen in [[retard|debate]] topics, he is adamant on starting shit he cannot finish, and when he finally realizes he has been [[logic|outwit]], he quickly [[BAWWW|backs off]] and demands all users do the same. After all, it's the only [[flame wars|respectful]] thing to do!eleventy!!

==They found us!==
In the local [http://forums.dragcave.net/index.php?showtopic=39235 Art Nazi thread] ([[OMG]] posting the sprites with credit is BAD, m'kay, and results in polite mails to [[BAWW|STOP SPREADING TEH SECRETZ]]) they actually found and posted a link to this thread. 

Thanks for the FREE traffic to all guide sites like this that would have otherwise gone unnoticed, thus preserving your secrets! [[retard| Thanks, geniuses]].

''QUOTE (Loli @ Feb 15 2009, 03:44 AM)
How in the world is that cheating? If we had some magical program that auto hatched eggs or changed what came out of it that would be a cheat. It's called a guide for a reason genius! If you don't want people to know without hatching their own eggs you might as well block access to all scrolls too. Most people would be able to put two and two together and realize what adults and hatchlings come out of what eggs after seeing a few scrolls. Hell that's how I decided on my own eggs in the first place.''

''QUOTE (Layn @ Feb 15 2009, 12:51 AM)
the point of the cave is to learn what egg hatches into what on your own. that is how tj designed it. Posting guides is against this, as they reveal to anyone what becomes what, and takes away teh challenge that is the game. learning what tehy hatch into still takes some thought.''

''Do you even read what you post or are you just parroting that from everyone else?'' -- Seiken no Hisui in reply to Sabbita/Layn and Loli  Feb 15 2009, 03:57 AM



[[delete fucking everything|'''Thread Wipe!!''']] with rewrite of first post:'' This is not a thread for discussion. Just post the link or links in question and leave. Do not respond to others' posts unless you have pertinent information to add. '''If you find dragcave art on a website and it is not being posted as a collectible or in strict relation to dragcave (as a scroll link, etc) please post a link to it here''' or report it to the site if it is one such as deviantart where they will remove it. Even if it has a "from dragcave" tag somewhere it is still likely to be theft, as you are not allowed to use dragcave art without permission from the artist (and the artists are not likely to have given permission). This is especially true if the poster has edited it and is not giving credit. I greatly dislike egg guides, but '''as long as they are not claiming to have permission and there aren't any adds on the guide don't bother posting them'''. They're more trouble to take down than they're worth. '' -- This post has been edited by Pokemonfan13 on Feb 15 2009, 08:07 PM (contradict much?)

=What Dragon Cave does not want you to know=
These are the highly guarded secrets of Dragon Cave. Posting these on the Dragon Cave or any affiliated site will get you banned, flamed until black and cripsy by teenage girls, and then eaten by TJ. In the interest of free speech and saving time for anyone who might ever contemplate joining Dragon Cave, these dark secrets must be brought to light! Without these dearly-kept secrets there would be far fewer [[16-year-old girl]]s glued to the screen and madly clicking and [[Pedobear]] would be much happier.

Think of the [[Pedobear]]- spread the secrets.

All art is copyright the [[looser|wonderful artists]] at [http://dragcave.net/ Dragon cave]. [[Fuck you|Thank you]].

Updated: Now there's a Wikia site dedicated to this [[crap | site]]. To help put less [[bullshit | information]] and shitty pixel art on here, read what you want at [http://dragcave.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Cave_Wiki that site]. Queen Twat found his brain and realised other [[Retard | people]] had brains too and could actually work out what dragon came from what egg. About fucking time too.

====Pokemon Night====
[[Image:Dc pokemon night.jpg|right|thumb|[[April Fools]], Nintendo might sue!]]
On the night of [[April Fools]], [[Cuntboy|TJ]] decided to whip out his [[e-penis]] and replaced half the sprites on DC with [[Furries|Pokemon]] sprites. Much [[Baw|BAWWWWING]] arose as the Art Nazis realised that for the few minutes they used those sprites without credit, Nintendo would sue DC. [[Retard|Others]] simply [[Baw|Bawwwed]] about the admin's account getting hacked while some posted that they couldn't get to sleep because they were crying too hard about not knowing what was happening (unfortunately we couldn't retrieve this post as TJ [[Delete fucking everything|deleted the thread]], surprise). Yet no one stopped to realise [[Fail|it was April Fool's night anyway]].

====St Patrick's Day====
Many [[Furfags|members]] decided to join the usual [[Retard|Elite DC players]] in awaiting to see if [[Cuntboy|TJ]] would release new shitty pixel art. Much to their dismay this didn't happen plus the fact that so many [[Furries|people]] where on the site, DC had a [[Fail|server crash]]. [[Baw|Bawwing]] occured once more as people could not check up on their dragons and even more [[Baw|Bawwing]] occured when their pixels got [[Raped|killed]] as the server was down for 2-3 weeks. Once TJ restored the server though, the [[16-year-old_girls| 16 year old girls]] hailed his work and sucked his [[e-penis]] hard.

Asshattery at its greatest:

<div style="height:200px; overflow:scroll;">
''You enter the cave as you did daily to adopt a dragon hatchling or egg, adding to your family. But what you find were no dragons, no eggs, only something else, something much more sinister than the annoying Lagmonster Dragon you tackled once before. Piles of adult dragon and hatchling bones scattered about as well as egg shells of various dragons. A low growl is heard as you enter the cave and soon you find your path blocked by a sinister dragon that was feared by all. Sharp fangs gnawing in flesh as claws ripped apart everything in its path. Solid datachip wings were folded to its back as its red eyes of death make you shriek in terror....you were staring into the eyes of none other than the Datamonster!''

''All was thought to be lost for the beloved dragons and there was thought to be no hope in rescuing them, no matter how hard the owners tried. The Datamonster was just too strong! Just then, a knight stood out amongst them all by the name of TJ09.''

''Raising his trusty sword-of-recovering, TJ09 took a mighty swing at the Datamonster's vile bloated stomach. The awesome power of sword rent asunder the evil beast hide, releasing and reviving all the dragons trapped within. The Datamonster let out a final mighty roar of anguish, clawing at the sky as if trying return the escaping dragons to his gaping maw. Having released the dragons TJ09 made a mighty leap and with one sure sweep of his magnificent sword beheaded the vile Datamonster, ending it's threat once and for all!''

''But, unbeknown to TJ and the revived dragons, The ferocious and evil Datamonster still clung to the mortal coil. As the brave knight walked away, the cybernetic beast's limbs began to twitch, nearly imperceptible to the eye. Then the camera panned in on the creature's severed head, as it's glowing red eye slowly opened up and narrows, vowing to seek revenge.''

''TJ09 is now a hero! He lead the way as all the dragons returned home to their beloved families. The owners cried with joy as they were reunited with their beloved dragons. TJ09 smiled, knowing the journey was long, the battle was hard but all in all, it was worth it all. With the mission completed, the brave and heroic knight disappeared into the light, awaiting for the next time his help would be needed.'' - [http://forums.dragcave.net/index.php?showtopic=62313 Aug 12 2009, 01:50 PM]

== Fangirl Says No More! ==

Dovealove, the 'artist' with the most shitty pixel art on the site, had a fight with TJ and decided she would remove all the art she ever contributed to the site. Not that we're complaining, less shitty art the better! However! Trouble ensues!

''"Hopefuly this will slap some sense into the community, tj included to treat their artists better" - bluebell rose Jan 30 2010, 08:16 PM''

More [[lulz]] was created on the thread when the mods themselves began bickering in the thread. TJ, being the [[prick]] he is, treated the [[16 year old girls]] like [[shit]] because being fangirls, they would never stop sucking that [[e-penis]].
This seems more like a repeat of the past, [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Dragon_Cave#How_to_Treat_your_Users "How to treat your users"]. Sources have revealed that [[Cunt| Attention-Whore]] [[twat]] TJ had tried to dominate and control everything on the site and obviously couldn't handle it. This is also why he is the only admin on the forum and why no one else has the amount of eggs under their name as him.

http://forums.dragcave.net/index.php?showtopic=81010&st=0

And of course, the mods have locked this to prevent bawwwing because their egos are just too fragile to handle it. And before they [[delete fucking everything]]:

== Christmas '09 ==
Twas the night before Christmas, and every [[retard|member]] was shitting their pants in anticipation of the long-awaited Christmas dragon of 2009.  But, it was soon discovered that something was amiss!  There was not just one dragon to be had, but 3 [[shitty art|beautiful]] [[recoloring|recolors]].  The [[furfags|members]] rejoiced, until realizing that they could each get only one, and [[BAWW|they couldn't choose which]]. 

This was a [[Oh_noes|catastrophe]]! Now they would [[nevar|NEVAR]] have all the dragons!  What was to be done?  Why, what Dragoncave does best; whine about it. The members banded together, swarming from [[goatse|far and wide]], and began to baww loudly in every forum thread that remotely touched on the topic in the hopes that [[cuntboy|TJ]] would [[lol|realize the error of his ways]] and revert the dragons back to one color.  Sadly, most of these threads have been [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|deleted]].  Their [[lulz]] is lost to us forever.

Some [[retard|clever]] IRC [[basement dweller|dwellers]] thought they'd be [[an hero|heroes]] and decided to figure out [[it is a mystery|how the site assigned versions of the dragons to different scrolls]].  When their brains gave out after a few minutes of such strenuous detective work, TJ stepped in and [[naked|revealed to all]] how it was done:

The mystery was solved!  The [[furfags|members]] discussed this new development avidly while continuing to baww about how much they [[H8r|hated]] what color they got.  Suddenly, from out of nowhere, TJ pulled out his mighty [[e-penis]] and proceeded to [[B&|ban]] several of the people talking about it, including one of his own [[OP|OPs]].  The reason stated was that "reverse engineering went against Dragoncave's rules", despite the fact that [[fail|it was TJ who told them how it was done in the first place.]]  The remaining members, furious at their admin for being such a [[fucktard]], proceeded to whip up a shitstorm of [[FYIAD|rage]] and [[BAWW]] such as had not been seen since [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Dovealove's bitchfit]].  Eventually, the IRC settled down and everyone resumed jerking off to the new pixel dragons.
