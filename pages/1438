A '''charter school''' is where [[concerned mothers]] send their gifted [[children]] because public schools are, well, [[shit]].  [[Some argue]] that charter schools refuse to accept [[retard|challenged students]] and lack [[black|diversity]].  Charter schools are designed small to create an excuse as to why they cannot accept that many students; therefore they can choose to accept [[DAMN NIGGA]].  The reasons for this are [[racist|varied]], the most obvious being to keep it from becoming another [[jail|alternative school]].

#Charter schools allow public money to fund privately owned, exclusive schools, taking away from the collective pool for [[you|every other student]].
#They are often [[religion]] based.
#Unlike [[fucking magnets|magnet schools]], which actually focus on specialized education, charter schools are really just a place to send your kids if you live too close to the ghetto.
