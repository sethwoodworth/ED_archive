WEB SHERIFF
{{Elaw}}

'''WEB SHERIFF''' is an [[party van|organisation]] devoted to [[trolling]] such sites as [[Oink]] and [[Pirate Bay]] in search of freshly stolen music on behalf of [[Capitalism|poor, starving musicians]]. Their business is based on restoring the [[Shit nobody cares about|online reputation]] of the music industry by sending legal threats to websites and ISPs. Being an organisation founded on internet expertise, their website has clearly been designed by a [[13-year-old boy|top web-design team]]. WEB SHERIFF puts its time and resources firmly into rooting out the [[b|causes of online evil]].

Unlike the [[Net Authority]], WEB SHERIFF does not work for the good of the [[Internet|tubes]], but entirely for [[anti-lulz|profit]]. The business model works along the following lines:

# Convince [[Prince|musician promoting their new album]] they can gain [[money|publicity]] and restore their [[Shit nobody cares about|online reputation]]
# Repeatedly send legal threats to [[Pirate Bay|piracy websites]] and sources of [[win|lulz]]
# ????
# [[PROFIT]]! (Or not.)

WEB SHERIFF is run by [[e-lawyer]] John Giacobbi, who has been on television [[old media|news]] to talk about the internet and is therefore an [[expert]]. The name WEB SHERIFF itself shows that he [[Internet tough guy|means business]]. [[Serious business]]. In addition to helping rid the Web of dangerous pirates, WEB SHERIFF's quest also involves ridding it of [[Fair use|"Subversion"]] and [[epic win|celebrity porn]]. If you have a problem, if [[Shit nobody cares about|no one else can help]], and [[Anonymous|if you can find them]], maybe you can hire... WEB SHERIFF.
