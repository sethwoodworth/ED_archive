Cuntpaste
[[Image:PonyVaginalContractions.gif|thumb|No, not this cuntpaste.]]
'''Cuntpaste''' is slightly crude Internet slang for ''cut and paste''. It is pronounced as ''[[cunt]]-paste'', and is also used to refer to ''copy and paste.''

{{squote|Hold on while I ''[[cunt]]paste'' this [[chatlog]] to you. It's fuckin' funny.|As an example.}}

Note that the key difference between "cuntpaste" and "copypasta" is that cuntpaste is used as a verb, whereas copypasta is used as a noun.
