Furseiseki
__NOTOC__
[[Image:Furry Desu 1.jpg|thumb|Original post, involving your standard "furry looking clueless" picture.]]
'''Furseiseki''', or '''Furry [[Desu]]''', is a [[mini-meme]] from [[/b/]] on [[7chan]]. It combines [[desu|one of the greatest internet spams of all time]] with [[furry|the worst thing to hit the internet evar]]. The result is just like every other furry spin-off: a fake smiley, fox-looking, overly-hyper creation that has nothing in common with the original meme except a slight visual resemblance. Being of typical furry creativity, Furseiseki images display a broad range of facial expressions, from eyes wide open and smiling to eyes wide open and frowning to eyes shut and smiling to eyes shut and frowning. Also, [[Sage Freehaven|one user]] envisions Furseiseki saying "YIFFU" instead of "DESU", thinking this an amusing reference the furry term "[[yiff]]", which means "I want to anally violate a [[cat|housecat]]." He's very wrong, of course.

==Reaction==
[[Image:Icuyiffingdesu.jpg|thumb|left|This is what you're fapping to.]]
The Furseisiki thread was met with the usual reaction from /b/; namely, everyone thought it was disgusting, talentless furry faggotry. Repliers posted the [[desu|real desu]] looking pissed and [[Cracky-Chan]] looking disapproving, called for the general extermination of all furries, and generally told the [[OP]] to [[GTFO]]. Like in most furry threads, several posters had never heard of furry faggotry before, and discovered it and all of its [[sick]]ness from the thread, proving that furries posting [[porn|artwork]] only leads to making more enemies.
