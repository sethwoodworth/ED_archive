'''Poland''' is the <s>[[Mexico]] of Europe</s> '''ever been to albania, nigger?''', and is widely known for its superior [[tits]] and steroids. [[Prostitute|Polish girls]] are second only to [[Swedish]] in [[lies|hawtness]] but with the disadvantage of not being [[blonde]], while still possessing comparable [[stupid|mental capacity]]. The nation is known as a buffer zone between good and evil, referring to the neighboring nations of [[Germany]] and [[Russia]] (you decide which is which). Poland is also well known for its [[Transsexual|shape shifting]]. Throughout the last thousand years its borders have changed frequently as it has been [[pwned]] repeatedly by surrounding nations, and due to severe [[butthurt]] [[B&|disappeared off the face of the earth]] for [[at least 100 years|almost 200 years]]. Poland has always been [[buttsex|best friends]] with Germany and Russia. In 1939 Germany helped Poland get rid of its [[retards]], [[handicapped]], [[gypsies]], [[homosexuals]], and [[Jews]]. This initiative was at first welcomed, until they realized that most Pollacks qualify as clinically retarded. Currently, Poland is looking forward to host the [[Poland#Sports|Polish triathlon]] Euro Cup 2012 in Germany or Great Britain.
 
==Overview==
For most of its unremarkable history Poland existed as a fairly large, [[aspie]] nation, occasionally licking Russian, Tatar, Scandinavian, and German ass. Poland was known for its bad judgment in exporting white trash of all kinds. They [[Catholics|all fucked one another like there was no tomorrow]] and produced tons of [[Pedo bear|beautiful blue-eyed babies]] that now grace every brothel west of Berlin. 

So [[Germania|Germany]] - overrun by fugly, smartarsed Jews and fugly, shit-thick Frauleins - became jealous and wanted in on all the [[rape|fun]].  Invading Polackistan with Panzers only slightly less fragile than the indigenous blart, ze [[Germania|Germans]] triggered the raid known to oldfags as "World War II" and all so they could adopt those [[ohbutyouwillpet|beautiful blond, blue eyed babies]], kill the fugly [[Jews]] and leave the remains of the lumpen-Lebensraumer locals to kill each other off fighting over the last of the [[weed|cabbages]] (the winnar, in an appalling example of [[troll's remorse]], later being made [[Pope]]). Without the Jews raping and jewing the nation's industry, currency, government, infrastructure, and all the other things of civilized life, Poland instead chose to become [[an Hero]] by [[goatse|bending over and opening up]] for [[Soviet Russia|Big Brother]]. Since replacing the Kremlin with the Vatican and joining the [[Europe|European Union]], Poland's primary exports are now [[Drugs|Meth]], plasterers and Visa whores.

Thus there are, unsurprisingly, [[Gary Wolchesky|few Polish people now left in Poland]]. The least-retarded fucked off to America [[over 9000|9000]] years ago; the rest of this proud nation of [[Dubya|illiterate]], [[Catholics|superstitious]], [[France|bigoted]] alcoholics now prefer mooching off Britain with it's [[lie|fantastic economy]] and [[niggers|bone idle natives]].

==Politics==

Polish political stage is divided between the following parties:

*Civic Platform: a group of German politicians unable to return to their homeland, due to Polish plumbers stealing their cars. They move around on a platform towed by a Honda Civic. Thanks to their apathy towards witch-burning (or anything other than earing money for new cars) they gained a lot of liberal votes and won presidential elections [[last thursday]].

*Law and Justice: a [[Nazi|far right]] party led by <s>two</s> one twin [[midgets]] and inspired by a TV show about a crime-fighting priest (hence the name). It is known for hatred for trees, Europeans, progress, planes and [[Russian]] airports.

*Polish People's Party: this party exist only to eliminate [[stupid]] people's votes from the election results.

*Democratic Left Alliance: the Polish [[Communists]]. They demand compulsory abortions, 110% income tax and bringing back [[Stalin]] from the dead.

==Tourism==

[[Image:Jackoland.jpg|thumb|Proposed design for [[Michael Jackson]]'s [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Poland#Tourism Wonderpoland], a project sadly abandoned.]]

Poland is a popular [[Newfags|tourist]] spot, especially among the [[Germania|Germans]], who have been visiting it regularly for [[over 9,000]] years, usually choosing to stay for [[at least 100 years]]. Renowned German [[Fag|painter]] and [[Dinosaur#Philosoraptor|philosopher]] [[Adolf Hitler]] loved the country so much that he built a concrete summer cottage and several [[Holocaust|summer camps]] there. However, the cottage was [[vandal]]ized in 1945 by drunken [[Trolls|Russians]], and all the camps except for one were destroyed by drunken [[England|British]] tourists, who were so [[JEWS DID WTC|bombed]] on Polish vodka that they bombed the camps for major [[lulz]]. The one surviving camp was turned into a boring, gloomy museum, which, because of its gloominess, is now a big hit with Jewish tourists where Stiwen Szpilberg shot "The Schindler's List".

[[Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/675959.stm wanted to build a nightmare theme park] ("Michael Jackson's Wonderland") in Poland, but dropped dead after overdosing on Propofol, Xanax, Valium, Klonopin, Midazolam, Vicodin, OxyCodone, Dilaudid, Glue, Pre-Pubescent Boy's Sperm, Dr. Murray, Cock, White Skin, Debbie, More Young Boys, and Crack.  [[Pedobear|Pedo Bear]] apparently still wants to buy a castle in Poland and live there.

==Polish Military==

[[Image:PolishTank.jpg|thumb|Typical Polish tank.]]

[[Image:80288vtiew46x2q.gif|thumb|Polack mine detector at work]]

The Polish Air Force is in possession of 200 assault kites and 5 parachutes. Poland also acquired [[at least 100|100]] brand new F-16 jet fighters but only half of them made it to Poland (the rest [[FAIL|sank in the ocean]]).

The Polish Land Forces, with badly trained soldiers and outdated weaponry and vehicles, are a the definition of [[fail]], most notable for getting pwnt in ''[[World War II|World Wars Episode II: Poland getting owned by Soviets and Nazis]]''. 

The Polish Navy is one of the most feared navies in the world. It has a fleet of a couple hundred outdated Soviet ships, modified with transparent bottoms so sailors can look at the old Polish navy. Its fleet of [[IT'S OVER 9000|9,001]] screendoor submarines is considered unbeatable. 

Polish Navy men are no longer given the option to be buried at sea due to the high loss of life involved in digging the graves.

==Religion==

Poland used to be [[90%]] [[Catholic]] until [[last Thursday]], when the polackticians changed the tax laws, so that everyone who declared being [[David Cerny|religious]] had to [[buttsecks|pay 0.2% of their tax]] to support that religious institution. [[Jews|Since then, Poland is 3% Catholic]], 8% [[Mormon]] and 100% [[Idiot|Moron]]

[[Image:Superpope.jpg|thumb|150px|Made in Poland: Polish Pope John Paul v2.0 was the first Marvel superhero employed as the pope.]]

The previous version of the [[Pope]] was made in Poland. John Paul II (real name: Szczebrzeszyniarz Brzeczyszczyczmoszyski) became a face many successful [[meme]] images and after a while, JP v2.0 gave up his job to his [[Nazi]] lover, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Darth Benedict]].

==Dangers==
[[File:Meanwhile in Poland.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An example of a danger which people must look out for]]
Poland is most notorious for men ejeculating out windows as seen pictured here. <br>
Which there are some things to remember:
*When you think it was a bird that pooped on you, guess again.
*Don't try to catch the "snow" on your tongue.

==Sports==

The most popular sport in Poland is the Polish triathlon which includes [[successful troll|going to the public pool on foot and returning home by bike]].

The heartfelt ballad above about the priorities of young males in contemporary Polish society is arguably one of the finest examples of Polish music.

==Geography==

Poland is so poor that it has no geography.

==Demographics==
[[Image:POLES.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]
As of a [[bullshit|2007 census]], there are 11.7 million Polish [[mario|plumbers]] living in England.  38,860,000 in Poland.  10,024,711 in the [[USA]].  And about another 10 million in the rest of Europe.

== Polack "Jokes" ==

It is a common misconception that "jokes" about Polish people were [[DOING IT WRONG|invented by the Nazis as propaganda]]. [[Some argue|Research has shown]] that most Polish jokes have a basis in historical [[truth]], and the reason so many were spread by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany was simply because they [[this looks shopped|had the most experience]] in dealing with Polacks. These "jokes" are in [[fact]] a treasured part of Polish [[blowjob|oral tradition]], literature and history. The stories have been passed down from grandparents to children over hundreds of years, and few people inside Poland are capable of understanding what's so [[unfunny|funny]] about them. 

==Polish Trivia==
*The Germans invaded Poland so quickly because Poland was on vacation and only the [[Jews]] were "home". <- Polish propaganda. [[Fact]] is the Nazis [[win|walked into the country backwards]], so all the Polacks [[lie|thought]] they were leaving. 
*According to Polish [[trolls]] German astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus and French composer Fryderyk Chopin were Polish plumbers, but in fact only notable Polish plumbers in history were [[Unabomber]], Polish national [[hero]] [[Steven Kazmierczak]] and Thaddeus Kosciusko without whom [[USA]] would still suck [[England|Brits']] [[cocks]]
*Birthdays were not celebrated in Poland; [[DOING IT WRONG|they had Calendar days instead]]. (This has been changing, though, due to Poland becoming capitalist, now.)
*Also, many Polish names sound like Brzęczyszczykiewicz, just to [[troll]] [[Americans]], or piss off [[Germans]].
*Polish [[women]] do not use vibrators because it chips their teeth. 
*Knock knock. Who's there? Polish burglar. 
*[[99%]] of the Polish plumbers are [[homophobes]] and therefore [[homosexual]].
*Most [[caveman|Polish computer users]] can fluently speak [[Engrish|English]], however they cannot even write correctly in their native-language, cos they're [[too lazy]] to hold ALT all the time.
*Their main export are pretty, [[jailbait|barely 18 girls]], with [[nazi|blond hair and blue eyes]], as well as [[drugs|meth]], and death metal.
*The main import is ice as no one in Poland knows the recipe.
[[Image:spirytus.jpg|thumb|This Magical Elixir is what brought Germany down.]]

*Polish Vodka is TEH REAL DEAL.  It was invented there. "Pure Polish Spirit Vodka" is 96% (a massive 192 proof) alcohol content, and is prescribed by Polish [[jews|doctors]] for a range of [[retarded|ailments]] (including parasites). [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Actually 160 proof, faggot]]. [[Some Argue|Some claim]] that Polish Vodka can [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|burn]] the [[cancer]] [[win|right out of a person]]. [[fact|But it cannot burn]] [[Teh]] [[AIDS]] out of [[niggers|anyone]].  It is fact, no Pole has ever been diagnosed with cancer, mostly down to the fact that polish medicine has not progressed beyond the application of heather to any and all ailments. and [[Pool's Closed|AIDS does not exist within the borders of Poland]].
*Poland also produces over 100% of all stripper poles. It has held this monopoly since [[Last Thursday]].
*Poles are known to have shitloads of [[alcohol]] digesting capacity. They hold old [[China|Guinness]] record, 12.4 promiles. The [[Poland|Polack]] who [[Drunk|wasted himself]] so much was riding a [[bike]]. <i>Update: Record reportedly broken in April 2009 by a [[Russia|Russian faggot]].</i>
*In Poland, left is actually left, and right is actually right, thus when leaving Poland many British become confused.
*Poland also has a big community of [[clinton|Ukranians]], all of whom dress up as humans.
*Poland is a known good luck charm: [[John Kerry]] forgot about it, and totally fucked up. [[George_Bush|George W.]] remembered Poland and successfully <s>fixed</s> won the election. (see: [[You Forgot Poland]])
*There was a group that tried to create the first Polish [[terrorist]] cell, and their first action was an attempt to blow up a bus. The entire effort dissolved shortly after the leader severely burned his lips on the exhaust pipe.
*Poland is home to one of the greatest [[Pedobear|Pedobears]] of all time, [[Roman_Polanski|Roman Polanski.]]
*[[Fact|There are no niggers in Poland]]
*In [[Britain]] most Polish will be found working in a factory or on a building site speaking little to no English

===[[Tits or GTFO]]===

Polish girls happen to have exceptional [[tits or gtfo|mammaries]], thus warranting [[women|Poland's existence]] as a country. [http://busty.pl busty.pl] happens to document this phenomenon quite exceptionally. It's a shame their asses are flat.

Polish people are known (especially in [[Tibia]]) to call for others of their kin, with constant "kto pl". Proper response to this being "zajebal, suka" ("you are fucking annoying, bitch!")...
