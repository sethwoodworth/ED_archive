Tinyurl
[[Image:TinyURL heading.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A magnet for faggotry in our [[Web 2.0]] world.]]'''tinyurl.com''' is a website which provides a shorter, alternate link for any web [[URL|URL]] address.  Although the site also allows anyone to easily [[paranoid|preview]] the destination URL of any '''tinyurl''' address given to them before they actually click anything, it does offer a certain amount of utility for very lazy trolling/[[rickroll]]ing/faggotry as it effectively masks the address from anyone who's the [[gullible|trusting]] type.  <br><BR>

==[[Typical]] usage of Tinyurl==
[[Image:TinyURLwebsite.jpg|thumb|right|340px|Proving useful to [[13 year old boys]] everywhere.]]
Tim sends Eric an email stating "omg check out [http://tinyurl.com/moq2m this new site] u have 2 see it!!1!" <br>Eric, not being the sharpest knife in the drawer, clicks the link and spends the next day trying to unsee what he's just seen.  Another use is [[FBI redirection]].

==Being inventive==
Tinyurl lets you choose a custom redirect name such as <code>tinyurl.com/georgebush</code> or <code>tinyurl.com/hotgirls</code>, make use of this when posting on certain forums. For example if you're posting a link to a new [[Grand Theft Auto]]/[[World of Warcraft]] trailer, make the link something like <code>tinyurl.com/wowtrailer</code>. Sadly most of the good ones are already taken.

==Trivia==
