Ragnarok
{{Needsmoremudkipz}}
[[Image:Ragnarok.JPG|thumb|Wheeeeeeeeeeee!]]Although many believe that the term "Ragnarok" refers to the great battle detailed in [[Viking|Norse]] eschatology, Ragnarok is actually a graphical roguelike game set amongst the background of Norse eschatology, all of which was made up by the creator of this game, blessed be by [[Allah]].

Note: Not to be confused with [[Ragnarok Online]], the [[MMORPG]] played by [[Asians]] and [[AZN|AZNS]]. This Ragnarok is only played by [[white]] people who dig [[Metallica|shit music]].

==Gameplay==

The object of the game is to immediately mix all of your potions to create new ones and then to drink the resulting products to see if anything cool happens. Usually, this results in the player exploding (causing the game to end), although once in a while it might also cause the player to be polymorphed into a plant (causing the game to end), or in the player losing his legs (causing the game to end when the player inevitably [[pro-Ana|starves to death]]). It was also theoretically possible to [[faggotry|play the game in the "correct" fashion]].

For a brief period in the early 1990s, this was the most fun it was possible to have without access to [[drugs|low-quality marijuana]] or [[cutter|razor blades]].
