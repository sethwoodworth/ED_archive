Nurelli
{{potential}}

[[Image: Bootiful.png|thumb|400px|center|The art…it’s just so beautiful!]]

'''Nurelli''' (currently known as Relloo too) is a whiny [[wolfaboo]] who thinks her art is [[rip-off|SOO ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE]] that she will throw a bitchfit each time someone dares to steal her bootiful rainbow wolves. She is an asskisser to both [[mirrorzan|Mirrorzan]] and [[blueShinewolf|Blueshinewolf]], and her style obviously proves it, her gallery is nothing but [[shit|shitty ripoffs, anatomically incorrect wolves and shitloads of vent art]], since she loves begging for attention while sucking up to popular wolf artists.
The best way to troll her is to tell her she is a ripoff.
DO IT! [[drama|YOULL HAVE LOADS OF FUN!]]
Just remember she blocks everyone who doesn’t give her the necessary amount of [[asspat|asspats]] to stroke her massive ego. 
Oh, did we mention she has a comic? She sure does! And of course her fursona is the main character who is a hero AND SAVES THE DAY!

Nurelli is also well known for the common [[butthurt| “IM LEAVING DEVIANTART!!” ]] syndrome, running off every month to a new account because she CANT STAND people criticizing her amazing creations because clearly, they are too perfect and there is absolutely nothing wrong in them.
Her past accounts were:

== I AM NOT A RIPOFF! ==
[[Image: Cloneddd.png|thumb|400px|center|Lost son?!.]]
Even if you accidentally thought about Assuva or Zan while looking at Nurelli’s fursona. [[lie| THEN YOU SHOULD GET YOUR EYES CHECKED BECAUSE THEY LOOK NOTHING ALIKE!]]
Nurelli can’t stand being called a [[rip-off|rip-off]].  I mean just look at her amazing and unique character Tex, TTLY NOT CLONED. Even the green eyes like Assuva’s are coincidence, she is THAT original guyz. 

[[Image:ripoff1.png|thumb|left| Not a ripoff, yeah right.]] 
[[Image:troublee.png|thumb| I smell trouble]] 
[[Image:bitchfit.png|thumb|CHANGE IT OR I WILL THROW A BITCHFIT]]
Even though Nurelli clearly ripped-off Zan's style, she kissed ass hard enough for Zan to let her steal her style long enough to get over 40,000 pageviews or [[moar|moar.]] 


And all this doesn't prevent her to accuse OTHER people of [[wat|stealing HER design]], I’m dead fuckin serious. Nurelli claims that her artwork is completely original and will not tolerate anyone that makes a fursona that has any wings on it's body.[[lulz|EVEN THOUGH SHE STOLE IT FROM ASSUVA.]]

If you happen to create a slightly similar design get ready to get your ass [[flame]]d. She will proceed to write a [[TL;DR|TL;DR]] journal about how people are [[lol|TROLLIN]] her and send you her entire army of fantards. This fantards consist of nothing but wolfaboos and [[furry|furries]].



{{quote| Drama and [[Trolls|Trolls]]. and why would i want to be on a website where i am talked behind my back. Back stabbed. falmmed ([[sic]]. Yes, she actually wrote that) and all that stupid stuffff D: |

== Art ==


As mentioned earlier, Nurelli’s [[shit|art]] consists of nothing but [[sparkledog|rainbow wolves]] and bad [[cock|anatomy.]] Let’s take a look at the [[shit|creative and extraordinary]] imagination of this [[cunt|wolfaboo.]] 
Below is a substantial amount of evidence proving that she is nothing but a [[emo|whiny, butthurt bitch.]]

As you can see her art is [[shit nobody cares about|repetitive as hell]] and the only purpose is so you give her attention and [[asspat]]s.

<center>After seeing this video, her fantards threw a massive bitchfit and Nurelli baweed. Read the comments for extra [[lulz|lulz]]. </center>




Nurelli recently [[baw|bawwed]] when she was flamed by Zan and was told to [[fuck|change]] Tex or Zan would NO LONGER ACCEPT ASSKISSING FROM HER.
She flipped out and flooded her watchers with shitloads of vent art before running off to a new account.

[[Image: zannurelli.png|thumb|400px|center|nurelli whinning to her fantards ]]

She immediately re-designed Tex and transformed her into a hideous beast with a metal arm ripped off of [[baw|Fullmetal Alchemist]]. Once again proving that color balance is for the weak. Nurelli's head is so far shoved up her fucking [[goatse|asshole]] she thinks her fursona is the most beautiful creature ever. Her gallery is nothing but that shitty wolf in different poses, all with the same [[retard]]ed expression on her face. 

But try telling her that and she will [[b&|block]] your freakin ass.
