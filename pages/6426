Piracy
Piracy was invented by a bunch of [[basement dwellers]] about the time of the invention of the [[interwebz]]. Piracy is now used primarily by [[pedobear|13 year old girls]], [[basement dwellers|moar basement dwellers]] and pretty much every [[white people|computer literate]] male in the world. But not by niggers, [[No_Niggers_On_The_Internet|of course]].
