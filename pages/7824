Known [[furry]] chaser and perpetuator of [http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2007/asshole-driven-development| Asshole Driven Development], Steven F. Lott (a.k.a. [[Boxxy]]'s stalker) is a consistent and relentless [[troll]] of all programming web sites including but not limited [http://www.stackoverflow.com| StackOverflow] and [http://ankitfadia.in/| The Ankit Fadia Fanclub].  While he professes to be a rock star [[Python]] programmer, most of the code he is known to have written is copied and pasted from [[Goatse_Security|other people]].

==Programming Experience==
While there are no full-fledged applications released by [[Douchebag|Lott]], he has been known to heavily contribute the following projects:

* [[IMDb]] reviews
* [[MySpace]] advertising components
* [[Windows|the winsock API]]
* [[Hipster|various LiveJournal plugins]]

The following Bash script was found in an arbitrary location on [http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/| Lott's site]:

His [[macfag]]giness has created a cult-like following among his [[gay|sailor]] acquaintances: he is the chair of [[Steve Jobs]] Fan Club Local 122.  Lott frequently tries to get his articles published in [[Faggot|Maclife]] under the pseudonym Ronald J. Charmenfelter, but all have been rejected under the notion that he has some semblance of programming ability.  Lott has been banned from all Macworld Expos for impersonating Steve Jobs in 2008 at [http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3454/3903193613_752df81d46.jpg  DragonCon].

Lott also has known ties to known [[DOUBLE NIGGER|Ankit Fadia]].  

Lott is also an amateur film producer specializing in online video [[furry|pet]] Christmas cards and Jew.

==Troller Extraordinaire==
[[Some argue]] that people with extremely large, protruding foreheads must be very intelligent.  While Lott displays intelligence at random and infrequent times, most of his [[troll]]ing is driven by his [[Aspergers|Aspie]] tendencies to spew incessant [[Bullshit|bull shit]], thus defying this theory.  Lott can be found at any time of the day sniping posts on [http://www.stackoverflow.com| StackOverflow].  Never offering any sort of solution, he is very quick to tell people that their questions are stupid or their answers are wrong in spite of overwhelming proof otherwise.  This attention whoring behavior has had him perma-banned from [[Something Awful]], thus the reason for his frequent trolling on StackOverflow.
