===Calling all [[Ausfag]] Anons!===
[[File:Poster3.jpg|thumb|250px]]
You are cordially invited to join an [[Anonymous]] protest [[IRL]], coming soon to a city near [[you]] in support of [[Project Freeweb]].

Although we're aiming for a fun, [[pussy|non-violent]] protest that's [[trying too hard|respectful towards the politicians and non-believers of all stripes]], the kind of retarded [[moralfag]]s that ruined [[Project Chanology]] by running around in [[EFG]] masks spouting memes will not be tolerated and need not apply. In fact, wearing a [[V]] mask may put you at risk of getting [[facefagged]] and mocked by your 'fellow' Anons as [[ALL CAPS|WEARING A FUCKING V MASK DOES NOT MAKE YOU 'COOL' <i>OR</i> ANON]] (see the [[Boston Fail Party]]). [[tl;dr]]: NO WANKERS!

===Conduct===
Apart from Rule 1: Don't be a wanker, don't stray too far from the press releases and YouTube messages that accompany the recent vidyas (see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEc80U46hIQ this] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30sYTuP_UnM this]) and avoid talking about any accusations of 'criminal' activities like the DDoS attacks that other Titstormers are engaged in. If provoked, steer the conversation away from this by saying that ''[[you]]'' personally don't take part in the DDoS aspects of Operation Titstorm and that this part of the campaign is handled by our 'experts' in that field. After all, most 'freedom fighters' have [[verbose thread|parliamentary wings]] as well as [[raidfags|paramilitary wings]]. IRL protesters are the public face of Anon and -as such- Anon 'ambassadors'.

Once we have been there for an hour or two and get a foothold it should be easier to do this. Bring masks if you must but -moar importantly- bring lots of flyers, banners and signs. I will have a petition for all to sign once we get there!

It looks like we will be good-to-go for the necessary permits as I've spoken to APH security and they didn't seem to care, so unless we fuck up we should be left to do our thing as long as we want and keep our crew under control.

Bring your [[iPhones]] and such if you have one and -if you don't already have one- download a chat client for it so we can keep in contact with the control channel. Otherwise, [[mibbit]] should do the trick.

Try and get as many pix and vidya as possible. ED will be the premiere destination for people to read reports about '''Project Freeweb''' and we want to offer as complete a record and documentation of this important protest.


===IMPORTANT SHIT===
#DON'T FUCKING SHOUT MEMES. Last thing we want is for the media to corner some uneducated newfag who ends up talking about [[mudkips]] or [[Picard]] instead of the focus of the protest, which leads me to point 2:
#KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. Read up on the [[ACMA]] and know exactly how it will affect the internet, get on IRC if you need to know more.

<big>Calling all '''Canberra''' [[Ausfag]] Anons!</big> 

'''WHEN''': We will start at 3pm aest Saturday, February 20 and will continue a [[STFU|slient protest]] until this shit ends. We hope that it will start other protests elsewhere in the world (at embassies and consulates) but we have the responsibility to set it off as it's Australia whos copping the bullshit.

'''WHAT''': We need to stress the basic troubling implications of censorship of <i>any</i> kind and especially the importance of maintaining the free flow of information the Internets provides. Citing "[[human rights]] violations" sounds a bit over-the-top but since it's inherent in the government's [[ACMA]] plans (as it pertains to freedom of speech and the vital role <i><u>that</u></i> plays in the very fabric of democracy) it's not ''really'' [[harbl|'crazy talk']].

===Outside Australia===
There has been interest in creating protests outside Australia.  If you think one of these won't be fail, feel free to insert your own city below, with Facebook group.  Protesting outside an embassy would probably be a good idea.
