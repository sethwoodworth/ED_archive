Brink
{{Crap}}

[[File:Brink.png|thumb|alt=Brink|Hey look at that huge fucking building bro!]]
'''<s>Borderlands</s> Brink''' is an as of yet unreleased, multi-platform game that is due to arrive late 2010, but according to some [[you|faggots on the internet]] the game isn't due until 2011.  But of course nobody cares because everyone realizes that it's just [[copypasta]] of [[Borderlands]] with the [[Sonic|"runner"]] engine of Mirror's Edge.  Brink is the hideous and abandoned love child of Splash Damage Studios who are also the irresponsible fathers of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, DOOM 3, and Enemy Territory: Quake Wars.  Furthermore it is being published by Bethesda Softworks, which garentees every fan of any [[Elder Scrolls|shitty game]] ever to cum all over [[basement dweller|their rooms]].

=== Plot ===

The plot is still rather sketchy, but consists of a gigantic place called '''THE ORC''' ('''O'''verdramatic '''R'''andom '''C'''ity/Island) designed to keep [[you|the hippies]] happy.  In the Brink universe, the entire world was built to some [[faggot]] idealist [[hippies]] liking.  Therefore, it was only a matter of time before the entire planet soon saw the apocalypse.  Nothing that cool is every shown, however, since you are stranded on THE ORC in the middle of fucking nowhere.  All the hippies are happy on their eco-friendly island until many boats from the outside world full of black person arrives.  Just like [[niggers|minorities]] [[IRL]] they believe that just because they're country is going to hell and being [[pwnd]] like Noah's Ark, they deserve to live on THE ORC with everyone who moved there legitimately.  Having good sense, the [[hippies]] say [[no]] and so ensues a massive [[World War II|lulzfest]] between the [[police|polees]] and the [[niggers]]. The game trailer wildly advertises that Brink will make every [[hippie]] blow a load when they play it, every jew get [[offended]] from being reminded of [[holocaust|the greatest moment in history]], and replace [[Call of Duty 4|Cock of Duty Modern WarmFap]] as one of the worst games of all time.  You get the option to play as the [[police|polees]] or the [[satan|niggers]] in a constant struggle of gunfire and [[rape]].  Unfortunately in Brink, it doesn't matter which side you choose as the [[niggers]] have infiltrated both and you will be forced to play as one regardless of who you agree with.  Because niggers are hated by all, it is speculated that no one will want to play Brink.  Each side has a different [[shit nobody cares about|goal they are pursuing]] so the fate of THE ORC is up to [[you]].  Though, ultimately the games plots don't really matter as ever nigger who buys this game will just be unlocking the Uzi and [[rape|raping]] the white women.  Meanwhile [[you|everyone else]] will be playing [[Is This Battletoads|good video games]].

=== Modes ===

Brink lets you play either in single player with the games [[melting pot|multi-cultured AI characters]], or online with the usual [[lie|12 year old hackers]] and 40 year old [[virgins]].  Splash Damage, having the shitty PR department that they do, has been quick to assure [[you|everyone]] that both of these modes will be exactly the fucking same.  Apparently, they thought they could rip off every apocalypse movie in history, then realized there was nothing new to add.  If you were expecting to play something different when loading up a different mode of play, you should probably have just turned off your fucking TV and gone outside anyway.

===Classes===

{{Notice|'''No matter what class you pick you will still be playing as a black person.'''}}

While playing on THE ORC, you have an option to play as one of four different classes.

*The <s>[[borderlands#classes|Roland]]</s> Soldier class is reserved for players who prefer to use their whole fist when [[fap|pleasuring a lady]].  It comes equipped with [[moar]] ammunition for [[you]] and your [[faggot|teammates]], and shit that explodes.  Pick this class if Silvester Stalone makes you wet.

*The <s>Engineer</s> [[Faggot]] class is for huge tweekers as they can take shit apart and fix it.  This class was created purely as a joke and can never be played properly by any person alive [[Black Jesus|except for one]].

*The <s>Medic</s> [[House]] class lets you boss every other player around and own the hospital.  A downside to this class is your addiction to painkillers and having to abuse Indian-Americans.  Oh wait, that's a plus.

*The <s>[[Team Fortress 2#Helpful Tips|Spy]]</s> Operative class was created to appeal to the [[James Bond]] masturbating clique of the gaming world that everyone hates.  In this class you get to sneak around behind enemies like a <s>[[pacifist]]</s> pussyfest and hack computers like you're a ninja [[Bill Gates]].  You can also disguise yourself as an enemy soldier much like [[Team Fortress 2|another shitty game]].  [[Faggots]] who [[fap|love]] ninjas will undoubtedly spam this class until you [[ragequit]] [[videogames]] forever.

===Custimizashin===

Brink comes packaged with plenty of clothes for [[indigo children|you]] to put on Barbie and Ken.  So much in fact, that the games [[PETA|creators]] have boasted [[over 9000]] different ways for you to look like a [[faggot]] before you [[an hero]] in Brinks ongoing [[holocaust|lulzfest]]. This is hardly surprising, as the lead concept artist for brink has a vagina.   There are also plenty of [[Dildo|weapons]] you can choose to hold providing they match perfectly with your [[Shit nobody cares about|pants, shirt, shoes, hat, battle scars, hair color, and eye color.]]  However, further gameplay footage has shown that there are merely 10 or so different outfits per side.  This also means that if you wanted to use a policemans helmet with a niggers shirt, [[Rage|TOO FUCKING BAD!  YOU WILL WEAR ONLY THE CLOTHES FOR YOUR TEAM BECAUSE SPLASH DAMAGE SAYS SO!]]

===[[boring|Features]]===

*Brinks first [[STD]] is something that the genius' at [[idiot|Splash Damage]] decided to revolutionarily name '''Smart'''.  Smart lets you do all of the shit that you could do in mirrors edge, except it adds an extra helping of [[fail|phail]].  Instead of having to do unimportant shit like jumping or ducking, you instead hold down the left trigger (or sprint button in Prototype [[amiright]]?) and your character will know what to do just by looking at something.  Apparently, Splash Damage had so little faith in their fans that they removed [[sarcasm|unnecessary]] shooter elements such as jumping and ducking from the shooter all together.

*Rather than boasting [[over 9000]] different guns like [[borderlands|some other shitty games]], brink just added a bunch of boring regular weapons and is boasting [[over 9000]] different kinds of clothing.  Splash Damage seemed to have forgotten that they were developing a first person shooter.  However, further speculation suggests that they merely decided to make 12 year olds [[butthurt]] for the [[lulz]].

===While Waiting===
Because you're reading this, you're undoubtedly [[shitting bricks]] waiting for this piece of shit to come out for the [[xbox|exbawcks]], while waiting you could:
*Masturbate to an M. Knight. Shyama[[Drama Llama|llama]] movie
*Namely The Happening
*Dress your blow up doll like John Lennon
*GO HUG A FUCKING TREE
*Protest the governments oppressing laws concerning the seeking of [[loli]]
*Go smoke a pack of American fucking Spirits
*Sacrifice a goat to save Darfur
*Enlist with the games [[PETA|creators]]
*Fap constantly
