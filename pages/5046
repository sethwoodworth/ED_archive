MCM
'''Multiverse Crisis Mush''' is a MUSH. MUSHes are like [[MUD]]s, except you can't gank noobs, and instead have to roleplay doing so. Similar to Tapestries or FurryMUCK, except it's only 90% furries. If you're into such faggotry, set up your client of +1 to Virginity to connect to port 5001 url eddie.rpg-works.net -- If you are HARDCORE NERD, use your Telnet client on your computer already. 

Multiverse Crisis Mush (also called MVC, which the [[admin|furries]] complain about constantly) was created [[100 years ago|at least a thousand years ago]] when the current king/director of the place decided that all the other video game roleplaying places didn't have enough [[Pokemon]] in them, and his own little Pokemon place failed utterly, mostly because of faggotry.

== The game ==

The main story is of a flux that occurred ten or so years ago in the game world, which united every fictional world (and some RL ones) into a big fuckin' planet. A giant sphere that mish-mashes every type of terrain imaginable, even space itself, which is explained away by the retard admins as having air but zero gravity. This level of creativity makes them suitable employees of [[Marvel Comics]].

== The Factions ==

On this mush, you can be either Union, (gud gais) The [[Confederate]]s (while not actual rednecks, they still hate niggers) and some people that nobody cares about. (Unaffiliated)  It's a lot like the left and right wing of American politics, except more people pretending to have e-sex with each other.

== The Admins ==

*Agent Jones - A [[fat]], unrepentant [[FF7]] fanboi who plays [[gay|Sephiroth]], who for some reason was not insane or a faggot (yea rite) among others, such as the Metroid Queen. (obvious [[vore]] fetish) Like many of the MCM admins, he will pretend to be cool with you as long as you have more power than he does or [[attention whore|something he wants]]. Got fired because he couldn't handle the <s>MASSIVE ENEMY DAMAGE</s> crowds of people seeking to join the faggotry of the place. This is because he suddenly got a [[life]] and it turned him [[emo]].

*Charon - The self-named Gripestaff, mainly because since he is 30 he assumes he knows shit better than everyone else. While being a man-the-harpoons fatass, and having at least two [[BBW]] ex-girlfriends (now starring in internet porn, not kidding, he actually told people about this stuff on NC-channel) he is a total asshole when not confessing he is the nicest person in the world. Was originally okay before contamination by other staff members, excepting bizarre furry fetishes.

*Reliant - The actual person in charge of the mush. He once played Proto Man on [[M3|Mega Man Mush]] before he realized that the presiding admins there would not allow for his faggotry, since their own faggotry was much greater in comparison. While for a long time he seemed okay, he quickly became frustrated and began to lash out at everyone when the amount of apps appearing in the mail box became too great for his wapanese app-staffers to handle.

*Fearless Leader - The king of the mush in name only, Fearless Leader (aka Red) plays that kid Ash from Pokemon, like, the TV show. After being kicked out of Video Land for wanting his [[Pokeman]]s to be sentient (something Sinistar would not allow, as he loves the bestiality angle on Pokemon) he came to form Multiverse Crisis Mush, then allowed it to be taken over by Eta Carinae and Nefarian, because his self-esteem is divide by zero.

*Govic - A giant-robot obsessed furry who once played Solid Snake on Video Land, like Fearless Leader, he left because noone liked him. He is in charge of the nigger-haters (Confederates) 

*Nefarian - While she/he/shi is appstaff, he never does any work and mainly trolls the NC and Confederate channels looking for sexor with Eta, the former coder who made the utterly borked in-game combat code. Once made a giant event in which her characters (and several admin only characters) were turned into Succubi by Kefka (also an admin, big surprise) and they then proceeded to totally rape the fuck out of the game in general. Needs to become [[an hero]].

== What these guys love ==

* They love when people connect and use the @chat g=[repeat(%b%r,999)] command repeatedly. Or you can use 'say ""', or 'pose', or whatever the fuck you feel like doing. They love it to pieces.

* Apply for characters who are exactly the same except gay. This makes up about 90% of the game population anyway. They may complain it's overdone.
