Coward
Cowards are often encountered on the internet. Sometimes, the cowardice is obvious, as when an [[internet tough guy]] blusters knowing that no one can find him [[basement-dweller|in his mother's basement]]. Other times, it's really obvious, as with [[anonymous pussies]].
Good example [[dalhusky]].

<i>Coward</i> is an especially popular insult during political debate. Hawks can be accused of cowardice because they are on the [[internet]] instead of chewing out the enemy's jugular vein; doves can be accused of cowardice because they are [[hippie]] [[fop]]s who couldn't win an arm-wrestling match with [[Martha Stewart]].
