Clare Werbeloff

[[Image:Clare_werbeloff_1.jpg|thumb|right|Clare is a fearless defender of the [[racism|Aussie way of life]].]]

(Before we begin, a "wog" can also be a term for a black person. Be advised and edit accordingly.)

Every once in a while, there comes along a [[troll]] who manages to capture the hearts and ensnare the minds of other trolls and [[mundanes]] alike. Be it their charisma, charm, intellect, humour or dedication, these people are to be revered and are often looked-up to within this [[ED|internet culture]] we all include ourselves in. 

But sometimes, a hot [[Girl|bitch]] just says something stupid, and it gets on the news.

'''Clare Werbeloff''' (aka, The ''Chk Chk Boom'' Girl) is typical [[bogan|Sydney scum]] and an [[Australian]] [[attention whore]] who managed to [[IRL]] [[troll]] the Australian media. This is no feat, however, as many people have been able to do it with relative ease. What makes her special is that I would totally [[I'd hit it|give her one]]. Clare rose to [[Internet celebrity|Internet fame]] by giving a [[racist|first person]] account into the [[crime|sporting antics]] of some of the [[guidos|the lesser species of humanity]] to a [[old media|Nine News]] camera crew covering a shooting in Sydney.

==The Video==

Imagine, if you will, the [[Erection|hard]] streets of [[Sydney|Sydney's]] Kings Cross. [[Whore|The Cross is an infamous red light district]] located in Sydney, [[Australia|Australia's]] biggest city. Its a weekend night, and [[drunk]] and disorderly people are walking the streets looking for entertainment. Suddenly, [[Counter-Strike|gunfire]], and screams wail from the terrified onlookers as a gang shooting unfolds right before [[I was there|their very eyes]]. A [[Fat|large]] man of [[Lebanese]] heritage has gunned down a man also of [[Lebanese]] heritage, but of a [[Pro-Ana|smaller]] build. Police are summoned, and without delay news teams from Australias [[Old Media|Nine Network]] are dispatched to document the drama which is unfolding.

In order to display a [[Fake|first hand]] account of the procedings, they call for a eye witness account from a [[girl]], Clare Werbeloff, of the proceedings and an [[Bullshit|intricate]] timeline of the shooting. [[Idiot|Little did they know]], the entire interview was a [[Bullshit|fabrication]], albeit an [[Lulz|entertaining]] one. The antics of Clare were broadcast, never-the-less, and within a short time, went viral on [[YouTube]]. Hence, the birth of a mainstream [[Meme]] of sorts, '''Chk Chk Boom!''' and '''The fat wog shot the skinny wog'''. 

24 hours elapse, and already T-Shirts emblazened with her now-infamous words are being sold on a [[America|US]] website. Drink bottles that also featured the words were produced as was a [[rap]] music video remix. 

{{quote|This morning, my friends and I came out of a tattoo parlour and there were these two wogs fighting. And the fatter wog said to the skinnier wog, "Oi bro, you slept with my cousin, eh?" And the other one said, "No man, I didn't for shit, eh!" And the other one goes, "I'll call on my [[Awesome|fully sik boyz]], eh!" And then he pulled out a gun and went [[pwnd|CHK CHK BOOM!]]|Clare, on [[guido|wog]] antics}}

==The Reaction==
[[Image:Thatsracist.gif|thumb|left|The general reaction.]]
Predictably, [[BAW|knickers were in twists]] all over the old media and [[Internets]] after Clare's account of the events of the evening, and not too long after that a [[meme]] was born. The greasy wheels of [[capitalism]] went in motion to create '''CHK CHK BOOM''' merchandise for the [[cancer|meme market]], and [[White Knights]] proclaim how [[shocked and appalled]] they are to [[nobody cares|anyone who cares]] to listen to them. She has now been [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,25534071-5001021,00.html hounded out of her home], and the [[drama]] shitstorm raged even harder when it was revealed that she didn't witness the shooting at all, and was only [[I did it for the lulz|saying so for a laugh]], and to get the [[attention]] that her [[Josef Fritzl|daddy]] didn't give her.

Unsurprisingly, ''A Current Affair'' - a shitty [[Faux News]] wannabe programme - are thinking of hiring her as a presenter. They claim this is because they are impressed with "her look, confidence and chutzpah", but it's mainly because their uber-[[conservative]] immo-hating audience will [[fap|bust a nut]] all over their television screens when she comes on with her [[racism|delightful social commentary]].

Unfortunately Skippy The Bush Kangaroo was unavailable for comment.

|The revelation that Clare Werbeloff made up her “chk-chk boom” story changed everything, just like [[WTC|September 11]].

The fact is that she did NOT witness the shooting. This was confirmed by Kings Cross Police.
