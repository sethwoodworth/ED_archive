'''The Bayeux Tapestry''' is a very large piece of embroidered fabric, more than 70 meters [[Longcat|long]] and only half a meter wide (that's about 230 feet long and 20 inches wide, for the [[Americunts]] in the house). It was created in the late 11th century to document the leading tapestry [[memes]] of the time, most of which were remarkably similar to the internets memes of our modern day, as well as the events leading up to the invasion of [[England]] by William the [[Bastard|Conqueror]], Duke of [[France|Normandy]] in [[9/11|1066]].


== The Battle of Hastings ==
The Tapestry contains hundreds of images, divided into scenes, each describing a particular meme or historical event. The scenes are [[Series of tubes|joined into a linear sequence]], allowing the viewer to "read" the entire [[fan fiction|story]], starting with the first scene and progressing to the last. However, because at some point in the past thousand years it was cut up into numerous sections, no-one is really sure what the correct sequence actually was. In the final analysis, it doesn't really matter. We know that the English lost because most of the army was out [[buttsecks|mucking around]] in [[Scotland]] and [[FGSFDS|Wales]], and Harold of England's forces were mostly [[rednecks|local farmers]] he [[rape|forced into service]] for a six-week period before [[Goofy Time|harvest-time.]]

== Fail becometh Win ==
Thus, the scarecrow English team got their asses kicked by the feet and swords of the heavily armored knights of French Normandy - the Normans were Vikings from Norway, who had moved to France for the tax advantages - but surprisingly, they grew to be very happy about the aftermath of the invasion. For one thing, thousands of [[Yuppie|rich Frenchies]] swarmed over and built up a bunch of luxurious castles, cruised around the countryside in their shiny oxcarts on the weekends, [[beer|mead]]-tasting, and the local people realized that these rich assholes actually spent a lot of money on expensive shit, so there were lots of opportunities for commerce. Soon it became cool for the local people to mince around practicing their French, and the old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon grunting noises they used to have as language didn't sound so good anymore. Eventually, the French and Anglo-Saxon sort of blended, and eventually became [[Internets English|the language we all know and love]] today.

== But the memes ==
This is where a study of the memes becomes imperative, as their appearance on the [[Internet]] is not only instructive from the historical point of view, but also helps to illuminate the meaning of a whole range of memes. The past is mostly a bad memory, and the future is uncertain, but the memes of the Bayeux Tapestry provide for the internets a precise and ancient mirror of today.

== How to make ==
A Bayeux Tapestry for any drama or meme can be created with a '''Historic Tale Construction Kit''', a magical place that can be used to illustrate anything.

===[[Skillz]] to write [[furries|tales]]===
*Use ye olde [[English]]. For example instead of "[[your mom|Yo mother]] is a [[whore|hoe]]," you could say "Thy mater maketh her [[money|wealth]] upon her back."
*Fit as many [[people]] into each frame as possible.
*Claim you drew the final [[image]].
*[[Photoshop]] "[[Goatse]] [[pain series|and friends]]" into the image.

===Topics===
When [[Jacknstock|on the internet drama hath taken place and the affairs all a huggermugger]], generally the fray canst be summarized in a great tale. Tis shall serve two purposes: Firstly, it shall produce [[lulz|great mirth]] for the [[Special:Listusers|onlookers of the fray]]; secondly, the situation shall be told to the tardy masses.

Topics regarding the intrigues of the Court are can also serve for much [[lulz|amusement]], but thou wouldst do well to make use of ye olde English. For example, "lol, [[bush]] [[suck]]s" shall become "Thy king's engagement in [[Fetish|questionable activity]] doth stir in me great mirth."
