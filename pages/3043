{{lj|forunlawfulck}} is an [[80 year old Chinese man in panties]] who pretends he's a 20-year-old blonde [[slut|girl]] to get his [[at least 100 years ago|100+ friends]] to help him [[troll]]. She also used to [[fellatio|suck]] [[killhamster]]'s big gorgeous [[dick]]. Her [[Internet lawyer]] is [[Nevin Zehr|englishpigdog]], who, like all horny [[13 year old boy]]s, wants to see [[n00dz]] of her.

Throughout her sordid career, she has trolled [[Nazi]]s, [[Goth]]s, [[Nazi]] [[Goth]]s, [[furries]], [[Republican]]s, [[Anarchists (LiveJournal community)|Anarchists]], [[otaku]], and just generally been a [[bitch]].

== The Blonde [[Pedophile]] ==
It is widely known that '''forunlawfulck''' is a [[serial adder]] who has 69,105 friends, most of whom are [http://www.livejournal.com/users/englishpigdog/info pre-teen boys] that she has cockteased into a frenzy using [[Internet disease]] photos. She is also suspected of [[bestiality]] due to an alarming number of [[icon]]s featuring wet [[cat]]s.

She brags about having lots of sex, but don't let her lies fool you. Although she hits on [[Internet celebrities]] like [[killhamster]] and [[recommendation]], [[The Virginmobile|she's never actually had sex]] with any of them because they're thousands of miles away, and she is an 80 year old Chinese man who is only attracted to little boys and has a hard time getting an [[erection]] otherwise.

She is also a [[lesbian]], and she and fellow closet lesbian englishpigdog lure [[16 year old girls]] into their warped furry lesbian sado-masochistic sex dungeon.

== [[Drama]] ==
She is an [[attention whore]] who likes to create e-[[drama]] with the help of{{lj|thespoony}}, her friend who got [[Permabanned]] for [[flame war|flaming]] every community known to [[God]].

[[Community|Communities]] she likes to create drama in:

*{{ljcomm|gop_vs_dem}}, a lame [[Political communities|political community]] she has the run of because she's friends with the [[moderator|mods]]. [http://www.livejournal.com/community/gop_vs_dem/221591.html 1]
*{{ljcomm|anarchists}}, which she started the massive drama in. [http://www.livejournal.com/community/anarchists/1061869.html#comments 1]
*{{ljcomm|statements}} [http://www.livejournal.com/community/statements/6754401.html 1] [http://www.livejournal.com/community/statements/6754401.html?nc=28 2]
*{{ljcomm|sufjan}} [http://www.livejournal.com/community/sufjan/117815.html 1] [http://www.livejournal.com/community/sufjan/117013.html 2] [http://www.livejournal.com/community/sufjan/116966.html 3] [http://www.livejournal.com/community/sufjan/116321.html 4]

Communities she [[moderator|moderates]] that create mild amounts of [[lulz]]-y drama:

*{{ljcomm|internetdisease}}
*{{ljcomm|iwantinwtfinfo2}} 
*{{ljcomm|wtf_user_info2}}
*{{ljcomm|sufjan4furries}}

She got literally hundreds of people to respond to a post that a furry made in {{lj|iharthdarth}}'s lame journal with "[[lol]] furry", which subsequently became a [[netspeak|catchphrase]]/[[old meme]].

Her friend {{lj|zhzhblyad}} stole {{lj|brn_eyd_grl}}'s icon of a dog in a party hat, and shooped in beady red eyes and a [[syringe]] in its mouth. {{lj|brn_eyd_grl}} [[Internet lawsuit|threatened to sue]] {{lj|thespoony}} for DMCA copyright violation. This resulted in an old meme involving dozens of [[unfunny]] icons featuring [[The Not-So-Great Syringe Meme of 2005|beady red eyes, syringes, and party hats.]]

Some moron gave her moderator status to {{ljcomm|death_note}}, which is a standard [[weeaboo]] [[animu]] community. She [http://www.livejournal.com/community/death_note/624493.html proceeded to de-mod] all of the other mods and mod her friend. [[basement dweller|Members of the community]] [[Godwin's Law|called her a Nazi]], compared her to various bad characters in the anime, accused her of trying to dominate the world, and [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Vandalism|vandalized]] [[Wikipedia]] and [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] articles to inform people of her Nazi ways.
