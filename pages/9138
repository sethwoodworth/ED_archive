[[Image:Italian-nativism.jpg|thumb|right|Study the above phrases. See the pattern? Good. If you are [[American]], you have just fulfilled your foreign language requirements.]]'''Wop''' is the scientific term for [[Italy|Italians]], also known as Dagos or Wogs.  [[Some argue|One theory is]] that it was derived from the Italian word "guappo" which was mis-pronounced by [[redneck]] [[United States|Americans]]. In Italy, this term was supposedly used to describe an organized gang of IRL tough guys called the Guapperia. Do not confuse them with [[Internet_tough_guy|Internet Tough Guys]] or they might put your head in a vice. However, if you are not retarded, you will notice that WOP stands for WithOut Papers, Without Official Papers, or WithOut Passport, all of which describe the average dago immigrant. Because [[bullshit|Italian is so different from English]], a wop will usually add unnecessary vowels to English words. Should you encounter a wop, show your respect by imitating this practice as seen in the image at right.
