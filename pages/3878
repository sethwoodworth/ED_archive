An '''iPod''' is the family of overpriced [[hipster]] jizzrags thrown together by the [[Apple]] Corp-to-tha-oration-izzle. What makes this family of overpriced hipster jizzrags different from other Apple jizzrags is that this family plays the MP3 files. Note: the files it plays are actually .m4ps, [[Nazi|forcing you into a corner of buying Apple products for the rest of your life.]] Fun Fact: For every [[Money]] you spend on your iShit, you will spend another [[Money]] on [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Igoatse.jpg accessories.]

The original iPod could hold about 5 or 10 MP3s and was fragile enough to break when you looked at it funny. There is also the iPod shuffle that was released [[over 9,000]] years ago and held about 1GB of songs and was small enough to fit [[in the ass]] before being sat on and broken. [[Goatse|An elite few]] however are able to perform anal insertion with a standard size iPod. There was an [[Chris_Forcand|iPod Touch]] released last August or something, which is basically the same thing as the buttsechsing [[iPhone]]. Avoid it. When you open the [[Pedobear|iPod Touch]] box, an evil [[mudkip]] will crawl out and [[lulz|eat your children]] and your [[cat]]. So, don't fucking buy one.

It works with the program called [[iTunes]] that people who are [[stupid]] use to buy music files online and can only be played with the Apple. [[WTF]]? In addition to iTunes, it comes with [http://www.apple.com/support/windowsvirus/ extra software with special Windows features]. You can also buy off an overpriced and pretty [[shit|shitty]] list of [[pr0n]] and games. They are fucking useless, aside from the fact that you can likely [[trolling IRL|troll people IRL]] with them.

The iPod has long been a subtle reference to [[Worldwide_Masonic_Conspiracy|white supremacy]]. Note the [[Kkk|all-white skin]], headphones, and a price only affordable by the Jew.

[[Andrewpants]] has been known to sell iPods over the [[internets]]. He'll give you the deal you can't refuse on an [[iPod]]. Speaking of which, you won't believe how much he paid me to say this! He's going to be stuck with a load of iPods, because the teenage nerds reading this will [[Enter Your Zip Code For a Free iPod Nano!|enter their zip codes for a free iPod Nano]] instead.

Warning! If you lose your [[significant other|iPod]], [[Mitchell Henderson|you]] will have no choice but to [[an hero|kill yourself]] for some reason. That's just, like, the way the universe works, man. If you even break the screen, those assholes at the Apple store will charge you 300 bucks to fix it. Cheap huh?

All iPods come with a factory warranty, but it's guaranteed that as soon as your warranty expires, your iPod will [[fail]]. And if perchance your iPod fails before your warranty expires, you can always mail it in for a [[Bullshit|brand new iPod]] that will be shipped [[P-p-p-powerbook|within 1 business week]].

== The iPod Shuffle ==

[[Image:Do_Not_Eat_iPod_Shuffle.png|thumb|Apple shows concern for its [[retards|core demographic]].]]
[[Image:Blackmanwhiteearphones.jpg|thumb|Can you taste the sheer cool radiating off this Shuffle-owner?]]

The iPod Shuffle is exactly the same as a regular iPod, without any of the [[fail|unique and sexy]] features of a standard iPod. It was simply a marketing ploy by some Jew working at Apple to get more money out of you. This bitch somehow thinks that people who already own an iPod are going to rush out and buy an iPod Shuffle, because "Random is hte wne rreod (The new order)". The great stupidity of an iPod Shuffle is that its main selling point is its shuffle feature. Note that every other iPod has a shuffle feature. And a screen. And more capacity. And more battery life. And more [[lulz]].

In fact, the only thing the iPod Shuffle does have is an extra $50 spent on 2GB of memory that [[stupid|you could have gotten for only $10]] for ANY OTHER MP3 PLAYER. This does not count the desire to bash your head repeatedly against the wall upon purchase.

Anyone who owns both an iPod and an iPod Shuffle is a [[fucktard]] who should be immediately thrown into a pit of [[batshit crazy]] anal raping [[goatse|goatses]]. [[Tyra Banks]] could work, but this has not yet been tested. Also note how the original iPod Shuffle looks like a tampon, and the new one like a condom wrapper.

== The iPod Nano ==
The iPod Nano is [[Apple]]'s replacement to the iPod Mini, which had a battery that went absolutely dead if you ran it out and recharged it more than once. The Nano is absolutely worthless in design. It sports a screen about the size of a quarter to view all of your favorite [[porn]], see all of your [[emo|album art on]], and now even squint at your favorite [[desu|four videos]]! As of the first iteration, the iPod Nano came in the iPod's original colors, then came in four [[gay|new]] colors, and now comes in five [[shit|newer]] colors. The 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is a fucking useless brick for what [[tonight we dine in hell|you pay for it]]. You can save money by <strike>getting a cassette player</strike> [[kill it with fire|killing it with fire]] which is superior to the Nano in every way, yet the Nano [[PROFIT|sells]] [[over 9,000]] units every day! Lulz!

== The iPod Video ==
Eventually Apple realized that people wanted to watch [[pr0n]] on their iPod. So they created the iPod Video and released videos on [[iTunes]], but since it only had certain movies like ''[[Jack Sparrow|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', everyone just put their own [[warez|pirated]] videos on it. After video support was included on the iPod Nano, they released the iPod Video again but called it the "iPod Classic". It was exactly the same as the Video but added a pointless image on the menu that took up half the screen and slowed down the iPod while you waited for it to load. 

== The iPod Touch ==
Congratulations, you have been selected to receive a [[lies|free iPod Touch!]]

As of [[2012]], Apple has released the iPod Touch, a [[Fact|gimpy version]] of the [[iPhone]] which features [[crapp|everything]] but the phone and a portable version of [[shit|Mac OS X]]. It's the latest piece of shit to be spewed out of Steve Jobs' [[Goatse|loose asshole]]. It has been known to not work at all, be shipped without it's battery, [[Mitchell_Henderson|be stolen]], freeze up, come without software, and even [[Irony|refuse to download music]] (iRony?). The iPod Touch is constantly referred to as the "iTouch". This term is typically used by [[pedophiles]] and lazyass [[Retards|teenagers]], and causes much [[rage]] amongst the mentally stable percentage of the human population. Apple [[faggot|fans]] proclaim this as being the best iPod ever, when really, they're just saying that to hide their [[butthurt|shame]] that they own a shitty MP3 player and not an iPhone or one of the clearly superior 8-tracks or cassette players. The only people who actually use this crappy music player are those who jailbroke it. Jailbreaking in itself is fail, because half of the software to do so will brick your iPod Touch. After the warranty expires. [[user:Feuer|Feuer]] uses one because he fucked up his computer, and he's a toolbag. Did I mention that its auto fill feature changes fuck into duck, and that it will drive you batshit insane when trying to type on this fucking page?

== The iPad ==

Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse with the iPod Touch, Apple developed a new jizzrag, the iPad. The iPad is the exact same thing as the iPod Touch, but [[over 9000|a thousand]] times larger and [[at least 100|twelve billion]] pounds heavier. It still plays music, but again, it's fucking huge. So much for on the go. The starting price for these bricks is 600 dollars, so if [[you]] are stupid enough to buy one, we suggest you [[Balloon Boy|create a hoax to get enough money from reality shows
]].

== The iPod is NO MP3-player ==

[[File:Ralph ipod retard.jpg|thumb|[[Retard|Typical ipod user]]]]

As we all know, the iPod is an MP3-player. [[Fact]]. 

[[idiot|People who have iPods don't seem to think so]], and they think it belongs in a whole other category of gadgets. 

This strain of thought usually runs in two categories: one group who never says "I want to put this song on my MP3-player", but instead they like to replace the word MP3-player with iPod, because they're all [[n00bs]]. Old [[German]] books are full of iPod [[grammar nazi|propaganda]], these people probably have adapted a [[chan|modern]] version of this. Also, adults who [[learn to|do not know how to internet]] and see [[you]] with headphones plugged into a fucking boombox, [[they]] know it is really an iPod.

While it IS possible to listen to [[warez|mp3s]] on an iPod, you are required to use the super [[FAIL|win]]some software iTunes, which renames all your files to [[gay|FAGZ.mp3]] and other such variations, to deter from [[fun|song-sharing]]. However, [[Apple]] does not want you to be without the muzak, so they supply a [[shit|fan]]-tastic store on [[internets|teh internets]] so you can pay [[Over 9000|1,200% more]] for your songs while artists go broke and [[Steve Jobs]] shits on a solid gold <s>toilet</s> throne. Oh and you can't listen to them anywhere but your iPod. [[no|Car?]] [[no|Work?]] [[maybe|Upstairs?]] This is because iTunes music is in [[gay|.m4p]] format which means "Media 4 Pricks". Note [[Apple]]'s [[1337]] use of the numeral [[faggotry|'4' in place of the word 'for'.]]

The second group of people would rather their [[fail|iFail]] be used as the Swiss Army knife of penis size enhancers.  They will go to any length, risk any breakage, to do things such as put Linux on their iPod so they can [[basement-dweller|play Doom]] with the [[gay]] little click wheel and have a background picture of [[whore|Stormy Daniels]] bending over for cawkage.  But, their [[jailbait|jailbreak]] efforts [[fail]] and leave them with a [[accidentally|borked]] operating system, so they inevitably become [[an hero]].  

Both groups, needless to say, [[win|<strike>fail</strike>]] win more than a [[tubgirl|Mideastern whore]] with a STD.

== White Headphones ==
It is generally accepted by those who own iPods that white headphones are the ultimate symbol of greatness and paying a shitload for just that. Anyone who does not use white headphones is probably a [[Uncyclopedia|Nazi terrorist lesbian alien who should have rotten buffalo wings thrown in their general direction]]. In the case of those who do not own white headphones, the accusations are reversed. Thus, it is best for headphones to be abandoned at all cost, and psychic relations forged with iPods so as to hear the sweet, sweet music within. These headphones usually last from 1 hour to a week, the speaker usually blows out. They are a piece of shit. You can solve this problem by buying overpriced Sennheiser headphones that cost [[over 9,000]] dollars.

Black iPods exist, but they also include white earphones. This is because Apple has a selective anti-black person policy. Good for them!

=== [[White]] Headphones and [[Black]] People ===
An excellent way to [[trolling IRL|troll IRL]] is to wear white headphones with some shitty $5 Walkman. As thieves associate white headphones with iPods, they will then try to steal it. When they discover that what they have just stolen is worth [[over 9,000]] dollars less than they thought it was, you will most likely be [[raped|stabbed]]. Because some black iPods were made, [[Apple|some people]] referred to them as nigPods.

==Care and Servicing==

[[Image:PopeHitTheDove.gif|thumb|Typical iPod ad.]]

[[LOLWUT|An iPod is the only thing your nuts can scratch. Be careful not to touch the iPod. Doing so will present you with a mystical tree. The tree has many leaves and you must pick one. One and only one, the correct one. The wrong one will unleash a cyber-virus that will infect your brain and kill you. This leaf will buy you enough time to get to the future doctor and have him swap your brain into a female body. Then, without nuts, you won't have to ever worry about scratching them or your iPod.]]

==So You've Broken Your iPod?==
Have you played your iPod? Looked at it? Opened the box you purchased it in? If so, it is now inoperable. Immediately purchase a new one. You are low on money? Steal some. [[Alex Wuori|Suck a dick]] if need be. Apple is not responsible for any damages that occur to your iPod, including damages that may be a result of [[Steve Jobs]] gleefully raping your anus with an iPhone.

==iJacking==

[[Image:ToCatchAnIJacker.png]]

Thanks to [[NBC]] and [[Chris Hansen]], the age-old mystery of what happens if someone leaves a boxed and unsecured iPod in public has been answered. Armed with ten thousand dollars worth of iPods, they set off across the [[United States]] in their Pedo's Winnebago [[It was a social experiment|to conduct their own experiment]].
This consisted of:
*(1) Leaving an iPod in public.
*(2) Recording the "theft".
*(3) Tracking down the iPods.
*(4) [[????|????]]
*(5) [[Profit|PROFIT]]!!!  

Since [[Apple]] was unwilling to assist Dateline's staff with their iEntrapment and general assbaggery, [[NBC]] payed a [[spam|spam haas]], $40,000 (Real Jew Gold), to bundle some spyware with the included copy of iTunes; the experiment only caught thieves that happened to use the included version of iTunes and to supply their actual physical address.   

Results: People do not have any reservations about taking iPods left in public because they are a commodity; iPods are ingots of hipster gold.
