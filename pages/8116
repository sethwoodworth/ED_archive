[[Image:Deatheggboss1.png|thumb|[[Avril]] vs. Thatcher. With no [[condom|rings]] it's pretty tough to [[win]]. Having said that you get as many attempts as you like because there is no limit to [[sockpuppetry]] on [[TOW]].]]

'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=move&user=&page=User%3AThatcher&year=&month=-1 Thatcher]''' is the [[Final Boss]] of all [[Wikipedo]] Checkusers, and once you beat him, you're quite close to winning [[The Game]] as there are only a few [[robotnik|bosses]] of higher stature on Wikipedia that you have to beat to unlock the hidden secrets of this text-based MMORPG and finally give the wiki, and by extension the entire [[web]], freedom. Unlike [[Alison]], whom we can at least feel a moderate degree of sympathy for due to her postings on the [[Wikipedia Review]], Thatcher is a heartless soul who delights in crushing his enemies, although on a good day [[Avril Lavigne]] can K.O. his evil, psychotic cold heart. He uses his minions such as [[NawlinWiki]] to conduct the small tasks for him, so that he can take on the big guns, like [[open proxy|open proxies]], which if you try to edit Wikipedia from, you'll find that Thatcher has often blocked it. This means that this [[internet tough guy]] is pretty much solely responsible for keeping both ordinary citizens of [[China]] and those who wish to upload illegal content away from Wikipedia, although in theory the latter could manage on a non-proxy if they did not fear the [[partyvan]]. It is believed that Thatcher is an employee of the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] and an agent of the [[FBI]] on the side as well.
