[[at least 100 years|A long time]] ago, the [[Internets]] was a place where one could "[[fap|surf]]" through the tubes and look up [[porn|information]]. This was long before the days of [[furries]] and [[fucktards]] and it was good. Until one day when [[Al Gore|some jackoff]] decided that it would be [[unfunny|funny]] if he was to post a picture of himself with cat ears on the internet, thus began The Ruination of the Internet.
This ruination is mostly thanks to the [[Emo|assholes]] and [[Furry|cockshiners]] clogging up the [[tubes]] with [[shit nobody cares about]] and not being sorry for it. Said clogging can be attributed to the [[over 9000|countless]] numbers of [[Furry|shitty]] [[shit|art]], whiney-ass/[[unfunny]]/unnecessary videos, and [[emo]]-filled bitchfests in the form of [[blog]]s. 

==Who's to Blame?==
[[Image:Poopdildo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shit|The usual weapon used by every ruiner of the Internet]].]]
Truly, there is no single [[you|person]]/[[website]]/thing that can be accounted for the ruining of the [[Internet]], but in fact, there are [[at least 100]] things that can be blamed, as they all have contributed to the Ruining of the Internet in one form or another.
