==A People's History of Prostitution==
At the dawn of history - [[Evangelical|around 6000 years ago or so]] - humankind had no [[money]] to speak of.  Thus, [[man]] had to exchange goods and services via the barter system.  The first known prostitute traded her [[beaver]] for his beaver pelts and thus, the occupation of prostitution began. Prostitution is the oldest known profession.

During the time of [[Jesus]], prostitutes were widespread.  Jesus himself kept a prostitute in his personal stable ranks and also kept company with a nice young lady named Mary Magdalene. 

Many [[serial killer]]s get off on [[killing]] them.
