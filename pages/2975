'''[[Fisting|Fists]] The Echidna''' was first spotted on [[deviantART]] in September 2007. She instantly declared herself the one and only [[retard|wife of Shadow The Hedgehog]], submitting image after image of her fan-character "Fists" in [[list of sex moves|romantic clinches]] with [[Cutter|Shadow]]. Anyone who dared tell her that Shadow wasn't real and that she was [[Insane|crazy]], was declared a [[Mega ultra super genius|retard]]. 

This makes her a typical [[Mary Sue]], thus she should be [[trolled|avoided]] at all times.

Like all good deviantARTlets, Fucktard The Echidna draws [[traced|completely original]] re-colored ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog|Sonic]]'' fan characters. In fact, the name "Fists" is so original, that [[at least 100|at least four]] others can be seen on [[deviantART]] at any given time. Amusingly, all of them seem to have missed the [[lulz]] garnered by the name.

[[last thursday|In January 2008]], Fists opened a [[YouTube]] account and proceeded to show off her [[AIDS|talents]] in video format. Most of her videos are [[Internet tough guy|incoherent rantings]] at supposed enemies - [[lulz|imaginary or otherwise]] - or anyone who dared to pair [[emo|Shadow]] with someone other than [[Fucktard|Fists]]. 

After [[raping|alienating]] everyone on both deviantART and YouTube, Fists [[b&|blocked]] pretty much every ''simple'' troll method on her accounts that she could think of and now sits screaming out her [[Shit nobody cares about|shit]] onto the [[internets]], while no-one can do anything about it.

Fists believes that if you ship a [[drug|crack]] pairing like [[slut|Tikal]] and [[faggot|Shadow]], or [[gay|Sonic and Silver]], you're retarded and [[Internet tough guy|should have your ass kicked]]. The characters have to have seen each other, and have [[recolor|matching color schemes]]. Though this doesn't seem to apply to her [[Mary Sue]], who [[doing it wrong|doesn't even exist in the series to begin with]]. Her love with [[cutter|Shadow]] is [[retarded|ENDLESS]] She made a [[OVER 9000|five]]-minute long video explaining [[shit nobody cares about|what fan pairings are and are not retarded]]. And if you do not agree, you're a "doof" who deserves to be [[flame war|stoned to death.]]

Fists is likely to be the [[Gaydiamond]] of the ''Sonic'' community.

[[cheating|She has a boyfriend named Johnny]] and she claims to love him. Poor Bastard.

==[[lulz|How to Piss Fists Off]]==
[[Image:FistsIRL.PNG|thumb|Fists sure is a [[fat|looker]]... Is '''it''' supposed to be a female?]]
# Create a YouTube account.
# Put her [[shitty art|character]] as your icon/background.
# ??????
# [[profit|PROFIT!]]

An easier way to piss her off is to say Shadow is a FICTIONAL CHARACTER, gay, stupid, retarded, etc. The possibilities are endless!

==Fists' opinion on Art==
[[shit nobody cares about|Fists is a fan of re-colors]], and her friend {{deviantart|sonicsclone16|Sonicsclone16}} '''(Who is actually [[Stupid|Fists]] on disguise)''' supports her [http://sonicsclone16.deviantart.com/art/pretty-much-MY-opinion-90317827 in this view.] 
ALONG WITH {{deviantart|sonamelia|Sonamelia}} '''(Which is, another account of her, shared with the sister)'''

{{squote|the people who recolor pictures don't fucking care how much people worked hard on pictures, THEY RECOLOR THE PICTURES GOOD OR BAD. ...ok, mostly good pictures they recolor. but still, you guys are responsible for making the pictures! so if you don't want people recoloring them, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE THE PICTURES IN THE FIRST PLACE|{{deviantart|sonicsclone16|Sonicsclone16}}, being [[butthurt]] after critique on her art.}}

[[Fail|And such a foolproof reasoning that is! If you don't want to be re-colored, DON'T DRAW]]!

===[[Shit|Own Drawings]]===
When Fists isn't [[Fap|re-coloring images]] she clearly had no permission to play with, [[doing it wrong|she's attempting to draw for herself]]. And such [[Shit|art]] she produces! Isn't it a wonder she hasn't fallen victim to <s>sonicsclone16's</s> '''her own''' re-color theories?

Just the name "Fists" will give you a damned ugly idea of what this character would look like under the crushing hands of rule 34.
