'''[http://www.felicefawn.com Felice Fawn]''', also known as Lauren Emma Cook, is a photographer, retoucher, and artist from England, seemingly well-respected with a clean track record. That is until she became [[batshit|internet crazy]] after releasing [http://www.model.felicefawn.com self portraits] of her looking like a dead skeleton while apparently unaware of her retarded appearance and unfazed by the comments she received on her weight. Her fans are primarily teenage [[hipsters]], shitty artists, amateur photographers and bloggers who have too much time on their hands.

A photo diary was discovered in 2010 of an anorexic girl, rumored to be Felice. The girl shared Felice's hair color and necklaces, and blanked both thighs exactly where Felice has tattoos along with her [[titties]] and [[cunt|vag]]. 

Although Felice looked like a disgusting bag of bones earlier this year, and despite self-proclaimed (read: [[lies|quite apparent]]) weight-gain, the extent of how severe her Anorexia has apparently been purposely kept under-wraps: she still denies having any form eating disorder whatsoever, in spite of common knowledge of her hospitalization earlier this year, as well as regular visits to a hospital throughout 2010 (heaven forbid somebody actually need to see a doctor for any reason other than anorexia). She openly rants about [[pro-ana|anti-anorexia]] and anti-[[thinspo]], another suspicious aspect of her online persona.

Felice Fawn confided in close friends that she may [[an hero]] should someone produce an article leaking any information about her. This naturally led to her white-knighting friends [[lulz|vandalizing]] this article. Since she builds most of her relationships on [[lies]] with people to gain [[attention whore|maximum attention]] her claims of [[an hero]] are actually false and her friends simply feed her histrionic behavior. She loves to play the victim card because [[bullshit|she's done nothing wrong]]. Anyone who considers hiring her should know that they just encourage her "illness" and support her "disease". Way to be a role model. Please tell this [[whore|fatty]] to eat a sandwich.

Not only is Felice Fawn an attention whore but it has also been suggest that she's an emotional vampire. Her [[furry|friends]] often complain about how she will go out of her way to induce some type of emotional suffering from them. This includes being jealous of their other friends, breaking up with them, and setting conditions for the relationships she has with them. The conditions usually are that she's the only one they're allowed to talk to.

Her most recent victim of this would be Bassdammit/Andy. He was left heart broken and bankrupt after his relationship with her. Due to wanting to see more vag and tits he still hangs around desperately waiting for her to realize that he's her true love. It is rumored that he spent shit tons of money on phone calls to her since they both live in different countries. After this she wouldn't let him come see her and she wouldn't let him fly her there. She didn't want to "take his money". Nevermind he spent $5,000+ on calling her. All of this because she'd freak out if he didn't while he was out and call him a cheater while she's fucking Rich who is her boyfriend. Baw.

==Felice Fawn the Furry==
Felice Fawn not only has a presence on social network sites but also takes part in [[Furcadia]]. There she is well known as Amia but she recently switched to Empusa. [[Bella|Naturally, everyone wants to have sex with her]]. Now, because she is a [[whore|good person]], she has the tendency to [[yiff]] other [[furries]]. She has even gone through [[lies|great lengths]] to hide her furry lovers from the [[fag|boyfriend she lives with]] who supports her.

Bringing up her furry lovers and the fact that she lives with someone she calls her [http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/profile.php?id=793270320 boyfriend] will often incite [[lulz|drama]] and [[lies]]. [[Drama]] will often occur when her boyfriend is contacted and questioned about how he feels that his [[furfag|girlfriend]] cheating on him with [[furries]].

Currently on her furry [[deviantart|DA]] she <s>[http://amiazest.deviantart.com/journal/17257929 scams people out of $40 cash for a 95x95 pixel square]</s> (deleted) of her amazing [[shit|art]].

Felice Fawn also has a reputation for being a stalker. One user, Dollette/Ashley, has become a victim of Felice's obsession. She claims to be her mortal enemy, but Ashley couldn't give a shit about Felice's attraction to her. Felice has produced many [[lulz]] from her stalking such as nudes of Dollette and personal cam feeds.

To troll Felice and her friends on Furcadia please do all of the following:
*Link this article
*Bring up eating disorders
*Ask her how many furries she's [[yiff|yiffed]]
*Tell her that her [[religion]] sucks
*Accuse Felice of being an [[attention whore]] when she begs everyone to watch her on cam

==Felice and Animal Abuse==
Although just what exactly happened to her chickens and previous cat is unconfirmed, There are hints that she abandoned all of her previous pets. For a respected animal rights [[PETA|queen]], there are quite a few rumors that Felice actually left her chickens in someone's backyard after she found out no one cared if she [[fucked|kept]] chickens around her house. She also refuses to rescue animals and buys from animal farms instead. There are even suggestions that Felice left her older cat on the side of a road when her [[fake|boyfriend]] bought her a new kitten. Despite the fact that her chickens are [[lies|home with her family in their yard, and her cat had passed away from old age]] before she received her new kitten, [[Vandals|butthurt chairforce furries]] seem to be taking the internet ten times more seriously than previously expected.

==Felice and Everything Else==
[[Last Thursday|Last week]] Felice Fawn decided that she is an atheistic Satanist and [[gothic]]. After someone questioned her on these views she decided that everyone must be ignorant and then wasted space on the internet explaining her [[bullshit|religious views]]. If you can ignore her irritating voice, you may be able to educate yourself with all the [[crap|knowledge]] she has to offer. In her blog she shares her all knowing opinion on various topics such as [[feminism]], wearing fur, and [[hypocrite|animal abuse]].

Felice has recently done an [http://www.vimeo.com/17035223 interview] where she explains that she's completely original and that no one inspires her. She also touches on other topics such as how she was [[gothic]] as a kid and how she [[retarded|flunked out of college.]] She goes on to say that she doesn't believe you need an education to be successful. The [[hipsters]] who watch her should be reminded that this advice comes from someone who is too [[retarded]] to eat.
