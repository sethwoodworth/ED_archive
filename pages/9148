World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was made [[at least 100 years ago]] when the big truck known as the Internets was invented by [[Al Gore]]. It was founded by three gay [[Bill Gates|rich nerds]] who loved experimenting with [[Jenkem]] ([[Cool|Before everyone was doing it]].) and loved playing [[Tetris]] way too much.

They wanted to make loads of bullshit rules and regulations so that new, upcoming web designers wouldn’t make websites that would make theirs look [[gay]]. Steadily over time, their power grew (as did their need for [[Internet Police|policing the internet]], crack, and hookers), and so over time W3C became known as the ‘Website Fashion Police’ with their endless lists of regulations and requirements to make websites look like shit. Of course many designers over time gave them the metaphorical finger of [[win]] and ironically still made websites that sucked balls.[[FAIL]]

In order to try to [[attention whore]] harder, they created more rules and regulations and decided to update them every three years or whenever one of them gets laid, whichever first. They also are installing a W3 Alert button in all copies of [[Windows]] Vista what will make a loud screeching sound at computer max volume for six weeks to alert others to updates in the W3c regulations. They had to promise Bill Gates infinite [[porn]] and blowjobs in order to do this, but they claim is it worth it.

The World Wide Web Consortium regulations are often invoked by pretentious journalist wannabes who keep [[blog|blogs]]. They do this in order to bash websites they've been [[banhammer|banned]] from. It is unknown as to why these people feel that they need to cite bullshit rules created by a bunch of [[Unwarranted self-importance|egotistical]] cunts who have no power to enforce them, but it is believed that they think this will make them look authoritative and knowledgeable about how the Internets work.

==Fact of the day==

[[people|Not many people]] know that the World Wide '''Web''' is named because of a [[Camel_spider|spider]], whilst the Inter'''net''' is named because of a [[fish]]. In 1987 the [[Fox|Toho Film Company]], creators of [[microsoft|Godzilla]], commissioned an out-of-work [[nerd]] called [[Steve Jobs|William Gibson]] to write a new [[monster]] movie. Gibson envisioned a virtual [[Tokyo]] in which the [http://godzilla.wikia.com/wiki/Giant_Mutant_Widow_Spider Giant Mutant Widow Spider] battled for supremacy with [http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Magikarp_(Pok%C3%A9mon) Magikarp] with the inevitable [[lulz|comic results]]. (Or I just [[lie|made this all up]] because I <strike>was [[wow|bored]]</strike> thought I was on [[Uncyclopedia]].)
