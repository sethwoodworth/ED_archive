'''/fa/''' is [[4chan]]'s [[Ghey|Fashion]] board. The residents of /fa/ are collectively known as "[[Faggot|/fa/ggots]]", "/fa/iries", "/fa/gs", and so forth. /fa/ is a [[Pussy|worksafe]] board focusing on [[Penis|fashion]], [[Cock|beauty]], [[Party|social interaction]], and other [[Secks|things]] [[you]] will never, ever experience.

[[Irony|Ironically]], the only career option available for /fa/ users is an FA: ''[[Airplane#Flight Attendants|Flight Attendant]]''.

[[Image:ScreenHunter_01_May._14_01.01.gif|thumb|Typical /fa/ thread.]]

Being [[4chan]]'s fashion board, /fa/ is populated by [[Hipster|hipsters]], [[Fags|homosexuals]], [[Girls|cumdumpsters]], and fat [[basement dwellers]] pretending to be either a hipster, homosexual, or cumdumptser. 

The most common threads on /fa/ are:

* "''Is this classy?''" (OP picture is a troll picture from /b/ posters)
* "''What jeans will go best with my new [[Gay|Chelsea]] Boots?''"
* "''What are you wearing today?''"
* "''How should I cut my hair?''"
* "''I'm only 22, but I'm getting [[Old|wrinkles]]! Where in NYC does cheap Botox?''"
* "''Ksubi or Nudie? What pair of jeans should I [[Steal|spend $350 on]]?''"
* "''Why are Asians the sexiest race?''"

Despite the hipster/[[scene]] user base on /fa/, the general lack of [[B/|braindead, moronic, fucked-up retards who think that same thing posted over and over again is the pinnacle of humor]] makes [[Request|/fa/ a generally pleasant board to visit.]] Not all threads are focused on fashion, with there being decent discussion of all topics in a [[Anal|depth]] that is impossible to achieve on [[B/|/b/]].

==Fat - Ana==

[[Image:Fat-skinny3_Full.jpg|thumb|Same shit, different BMI.]]

In the world of /fa/ there exists two types of human body. I know what you're thinking - "''Male and Female, right?''" '''WRONG!''' you [[Mundane|un-cultured, filthy, common, gutter scum]]. The lines of male and female are crossed so frequently that no one is sure if they have blended into one, or spawned a hipster exclusive [[Trap|third gender]].

The two human body types that /fa/ggots will only take notice of are the [[Fat|Obese]] and [[Ana|Anorexic]]. This is due to the fact that /fa/ users are all themselves at either one extreme or the other. /fa/ has frequent [[Pro-ana|Thinspriation]] threads, showcasing the best celebrity photos of the Olsen Twins, [[Brisbane|The Veronicas]], and Holocaust victims.

The honest truth is that it is hard to imagine [[Pedo|people who spend time on 4chan]] having any sort of body apart from the [[Amy Winehouse|thin and fragile frame of a whore]] with [[AIDS|HIV]] or being weighed down by the sweaty, fungi breeding fat rolls made famous by the likes of [[Oprah]] and [[Whale|Moby Dick]]. So therefore, everyone on /fa/ fits into either of these two categories.

So where do ''[[fat|you]]'' think you [[McDonald's|belong]]?

==New York City Meet-up Fiasco==

{{Warning|Despite what [[User:Unhelpfultripfag|faggots]] say, this all actually happened.}}

[[Image:1242088178691.jpg|thumb|The /b/ infiltrators at the /fa/ NYC Meet.]]

[[Image:FAINJURY.jpg|thumb|/fa/ wounded.]]

[[Last Thursday]] /fa/ had a meet-up in New York City for the purpose of [[Buttsecks|exchanging fashion tips]] and [[Rape|op-shopping]]. Little did they know that shit was going to go down, and once again at the center of it all was a [[bored]] and restless /b/.

{{quote|For those that [[No one cares|don't know]], on May 9th New York /fa/ was assaulted by /b/tards. 

This is a continuation of the original two threads on the subject. The description of each infiltrator is 

mostly taken from the original OP's post and information gather in that thread|Posted on /fa/ after the "attack".}}

'''But what even happened?''' What happened was that four or more /b/ "spies" pretended to be part of the /fa/ meet-up in NYC. All was well, and everyone was wandering aimlessly when suddenly, and without warning the /b/ spies threw ''flour'', ''eggs'', ''water'', and other ingredients to [[Delicious Caek]] at the defenseless /fa/ggots.  

{{quote|Three /fa/gs were injured noticeably, others had minor scratches or [[BAWWW|flour all over their hair]].

When some of the people at the meet up [[Lulz|tried to beat up]] the /b/tards they failed because the 

[[Cool Story Bro|floor was slippery and they ran after both assaults]].

/b/tards [[Win|didn't get hurt]], as far as we know.

This all doesn't matter, [[Lies|we ran back to the hostel in Brooklyn and had fun all night]].|An account from a /fa/ user.}}

After some serious [[Kenny Glenn|Internet Detective]] work /fa/ had worked out the following about the infiltrators: (''Use the above thumb image as a reference.'')

* '''Number 1''' - ''She was quiet, and believable and very flirtatious, no one suspected she was one of them. Her real name is Amanda, and her forum name is LittleSister. She has an article in ED under the name "[[New York Nurse]]".''

* '''Number 2''' - ''The girl with the annoyingly nasally voice. Most people did not suspect she was a spy, but a couple did due to her [[aspie]] behavior. [[Cool Story Bro|She claimed that she originally lived in Chicago and now studies at NYU]].''

* '''Number 3''' - ''We know he lives in Manhattan, he told us his name was [[Swine Flu|Pedro]]. His forum name is Incognito.''

* '''Number 4''' - ''This is a [[Goth]] Jew [[Trap|man who dresses as a female]]. His real name is Jacob Speregen, and his forum name is either Abby or TheLaughingMan. He pretended to be #2's friend during their infiltration. He is [[Gay|Gaston's boyfriend]]. He lives in Brooklyn and is 21 years old. He is currently in court for an attack against Scientology. He goes to school at BMCC.

'''They mean [[Serious Business|business]]''' -

{{quote|This is war on /b/, they attacked us twice, 

they will go down. They are meeting on May 16th in front of the Scientology building to 

protest.|/fa/ declares war on /b/.}}

The interwebs [[Flame|battle]] that proceeded after all this on the /fa/ board, (/b/ was still down, due to [[DDoS|attacks]]), was one that /fa/ had never witnessed. Most of the e-bullets looked something like this:

{{quote|/b/ and /fa/ both fail equally

[[Truth|KEEP IT ON TEH INTERNETZ]]|Good advice, Anon.}}

{{quote|What the fuck exactly are you going to do?
A few /fa/gs show up to a Scientology protest... 
They '''WILL''' outnumber you, they won't cry if their clothes get ruined, you'll get beat down again... 
You've lost. Get over it, you ginormous faggots.
Revenge on /b/...funniest shit I've heard all week.|Keyboard Warrior}}

'''And finally...'''

{{quote|I, for one, hope someone gets [[Columbine|shot]] and this ends up on [[Fox|the news]].|THE INTERNET}}

But just as soon as it started, /b/ was back online, and the [[trolls]] went back to the homeland. Peace and order was restored n /fa/ as the usual moans of "Whatever", "What is she wearing?", and "Have you got coke?" were to be heard amongst the "Ray-Ban" and "Eyebrow Waxing" threads.

But the 9th of May will forever be remembered as the day that saw both /fa/ggots and /b/tards outside, in the sunlight, ''doing something physical''.

<br>

All you [[Brisbane|Brisfags]] out there, take note. The Brisbane /fa/ meet-up is was planned for the '''5th of June, 2009'''. They met at ''Fat Louies'' in town and got drunk [[Fail|without incident]].

==[[V/|/v/]] Raids /fa/==

[[Image:Vfaraid.gif|thumb|/v/ [[Fail|raids]] an empty /fa/.]]

[[Image:Vfaraid2.gif|thumb|Moar bullshit.]]

On the 19th May, /v/, 4chan's [[Virgin|video game]] board decided to raid /fa/, proving once and for all that they really are just a collection of fat, neckbearded loners who are merely jealous of /fa/ for having friends and being invited to parties.

The raid was a complete failure, with /v/irgins just posting [[Pokemon]], in particular, [[wat|Graveler]]. There was also some reference to the IRL /b/ raid on the NYC /fa/ meet up.
 
It is obvious what sparked this raid. An unknown /v/irgin came to /fa/ only hours beforehand, asking about sneakers and was violently put down by /fa/:

<center>[[Image:ScreenHunter_01_May._19_00.46.gif]]</center>

This caused massive [[butthurt]] amongst the /v/ ranks, as they cannot stand their [[Crap|comfortable]] shoes being paid out. As a result the staplers killing /b/ used to raid /y/ was used against the 12 year olds attacking shoes eating shit. tada
