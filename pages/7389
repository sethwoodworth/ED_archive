[[Setsuna Toushirou]] ([[Powerword]]: Alexis Jacobs, born April 17th, 1994) Is a [[16 year old girl|16-year-old]], [[art theft|plagiarist]] [[attention whore]] from Missouri, with gums the size of [[Horse|Phar Lap]]. Not content with merely pissing off the artists she [[fellatio|admires]], she will not stop until all of her friends [[rape|hate]] her.

=The Setsjewna Toushitrou Saga=
[[Image:Flat_as_a_pancake_setsuna_toushirou.jpg|thumb|[[loli|Flat as a pancake]]!]]
[[tl;dr|Once upon a time]], in a sleepy [[Josef_Fritzl|basement]] of the internet known as [[sheezyart|Shittyart]], a porn-tracing [[weeaboo|appreciator of Japanese culture]] was born. Venturing into sites where she was [[underage|clearly not permitted]] to travel, she gathered up images of [[rape]], [[panties|scantily-clad]] [[loli|lolis]] and pictures of pink-haired anime chicks with the [[tits]] she wished she had. Her [[penis envy|breast-envy]] having reached critical mass, in an envy-fueled rage she began to transpose her own [[ugly|desu-eyed likeness]] onto them. But the story did not stop here, oh no...

==Sheezyart Shenanigans==

After completing several of these obviously-traced bastardizations of the works created by [http://ccreayus.web.fc2.com/ Creayus], [http://danbooru.donmai.us/artist/show/5331 Carnelian] and [http://hoshikata.topaz.ne.jp/kurimomo Kurimomo], Setsuna wondered what to do next. The answer was obvious: [[tits or gtfo|Post them]] on the [[internet]] and complain about how big her [[trap|non-existant tits]] are. Following the natural order of this [[schlick|slippery slope]], she began to latch on to several [[furry|fandoms]], including [[Code Geass|Code Gayass]], [[Bleach|Bleaugh]] and [[D.Gray Man|D.Gay Man]], pairing her traced, self-insert [[mary-sue]] characters with [[Dying alone|every male character ever]]. Not feeling that she should [[backpedal|cover up the fact]] at all, Setsuna saw fit to give all of these characters names which highly similar to her own. The end result was a plethora of characters whose names began with "[[anal|A]]".

A few [[faggots|brave souls]] caught on to what was happening and began the [[rape|purge]], only to be met with countless oblivious [[white knight|white knights]], hooked by the [[lie|promise]] of huge tits that would never be delivered, like so many before them.

[[rape|Screaming]] [[lie|innocence]] all the way, she was [[gtfo|ousted]] and felt the [[butthurt|sting]] of the [[banhammer]] - permanently.

==Retreat to Deviantart==
[[Image:Setsuna_toushirou_contagious_gums.jpg|thumb|The reality-breaking gums are contagious, they must be quarantined and [[kill it with fire|purged with fucking fire]]]]
[[bawww|Crying]] as she fled in search of a new [[hugbox]], Setsuna finally arrived back on the [[muddy dicks|muddy]] doorstep of [[devianTART]]. She was [[pwn|beaten]] and [[rape|broken]], but [[retard|not deterred from trying again]]. Still fueled by the [[rage|anguish]] over her [[penis envy|flat chest]], Setsuna began tracing and posting her mary-sue [[loli]] self being [[rape|raped]] by characters from various [[animu]] franchises once more. This time, she decided to add [[Chris-chan|Pokemon]] to the mix.

Unfortunately for Setsuna, since devianTART is much larger, this [[anal rape|exposed her]] to many more people. [[ediot|Many of which]] were far more [[anonymous|unforgiving]] than her previous assailants.

==First Sighting==

[[Last Thursday|Some time ago]], Setsuna's antics were [[stalker|observed]] by EDiot [http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showpost.php?p=327166&postcount=1312 FuckThatShit]. Not realizing that the [[The Game|game]] was up, Setsuna decided to instead start tracing overtime and compensate by [[delete fucking everything|deleting any and all comments]] which might endanger her cunning plan.

==Isolation of Friends, Apparent Mental Challenges==

[[Image:Setsuna_toushirou_curbstomping.jpg|thumb|Alex's [[BFF]], Nate, helping the [[dental plan|state of those gums]] with a well-placed foot to the head!]]
[[moron|Not heeding the warnings]] of many of her [[IRL]] friends, or even that of the outraged [[tartlets]] online, Setsuna continued her parade of self-degradation. Even after her [[lie|friend]] [[idiot|Ariel]], an apparent failure of a [[goon]] posted [http://kolourz.livejournal.com/12695.html this beautiful ode to friendship], Setsuna [[idiot|continued on]], oblivious that her kingdom of traces, rips and whiteknights was crumbling around her.

{{quote|Because she is [[dumb|oblivious]] and [[stupid|unchanging]] as fuck. Christ, you've been banned on one website for this, yet you keep doing it? For at least a year, too! You have actual [[autistic|artistic]] talent and nothing to show for it when all your posted stuff - even the sketch dumps - are traces. I ask you why you never post your [[kawaii|cute]], actual-drawn stuff and you just shrug. This isn't a matter of 'well, if they don't like it they can just stop looking', this is a matter of you realizing that this is seriously bad for you to be so damn constant and ignorant. [[lie|I'm your friend]]! I won't stop looking! Hell, I can't even tell you in words because last time I politely asked you to draw something other than what you do draw, you got [[butthurt|upset]]. And you pointed out a picture you did for you favorite movie months back as a savior to say that not all you draw is [[dying alone|egostroking/wish fulfillment/couples]]. Good god, girl.|Ariel|beating her head against a wall}}

Before long, the [[devianTART]] situation reached [[godwin's law|critical mass]], prompting a [[raid|call-to-arms]] in order to [[stalker|find out more]] about Setsuna, with aim to [[troll]] her off the face of the [[internets]], and possibly [[an hero|real life]] as well.

==WhiteKnights==

Tell anyone of these idiots below that she's an attention-whoring tracer and they will still defend her. [http://zerosmistress.deviantart.com/journal/35815664/?offset=60#comments Interestingly] she makes a journal telling anyone who accuses her of tracing to not bring her friends into the issue but to speak to her about it and yet what happens? They're blocked and their comments hidden cause she doesn't need anything bad on her page. With the names she's given to her closest friends I think it's fair to say she's closet lesbian who enjoys fucking mothers.
