Dave Eggers/Control
[[Image:Eggie_censor.PNG|thumb|right|Elimination from the Yahoo! database in Oct. '07 after a couple of months back in: seems to be back now (May '08).]]
===First Known Case of [[Missing White Womyn Syndrome|MWWS]] (Not Named at the Time)===
The [[Dave Eggers|Eggie]] empire rigorously controls who is and isn't allowed to keep an article on the golden [[turd|boy]] listed in [[Search engine|search engine]]s. Whether it's stupid fans who've never read a book otherwise ('cept of course [[Harry Potter]], like Eggers' scrawlings, a [[moron|cretin]]'s recourse for literature) in their lives making false complaints, fans at the [[Internet]] search companies, complaints by the management company or whatever else, the narcissist Eggers absolutely pwns the search rankings, so the article has a long history of being in, out, and almost in the main search engines. 

Someone occasionally complains or looks it up, so the search engine puts the stuff back. Still, it never gets too far, 'cos it's always been taken off the databases as soon as it started heading for the top hundred hits on the [[shit|heroic author]]'s name.

===Examples===
As of the 20th of August 2007, the only Yahoo! hit for this article was on [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Category:People Category:People] here. Yahoo! put it back on, the article started climbing, someone complained or was [[butt-hurt]] so it was censored again (see the pic.). Google is even worse; for a long time the article wouldn't come up for "Dave Eggers" but was in the database (only for a search on <name> + dramatica); now it isn't there at all. This has been repeated lots of times, and the other links on [[Dave Eggers]] have suffered the same fate (thank OMFG they are still in existence). A fairly nice one revealed by the yahoo search on Aug. 20 '07 (in the top 100) has already been disappeared, depriving book readers of the chance to find it here, as well as on the search site.

Both [[Yahoo!]] and [[Google]] re-listed the page after the [[Missing White Womyn Syndrome]] article and embarassment over the Digg listing. Both had a little [[lol]] at the time by only listing this section (when it was part of the article) in the summary. [[Yahoo!]] is the better site because it seems to have left the article on since then.
