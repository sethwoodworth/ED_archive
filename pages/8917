== The Fans == 
[[Image:Shitty_Warriors_OC.jpg|thumb|150px| [[epic fail|An unwiped ass looks more appealing than this]]]]
The [[fantards]] of this series are possibly worse than the [[Twilight]] [[fantards]]. They believe that Jew is a real religion and they must say "Oh my StarClan" instead of [[OMG|Oh my God]]. The [[fantards]] believe that every piece of art ever of a cat is Warriors related, and therefor always ask "OMG WAT WARRIOR CAT IS THIS??". The [[fantards]] like to draw [[crappy]] [[MS Paint]] drawings of Warrior cats and post them on [[devianTART]]. 

Roleplayers

Recently, a bunch of furgfag otherkins have made Warriors "Roleplay" sites where they pretend to be their own Mary Sue cats and have buttsecks with each other. Although these sites are scattered around the internets, most can be found on Wetpaint, a shitty wiki-host site where emofags can make websites about their pierced nipples and bawwww about their lack of a life. Notorious among these "roleplay" sites is Lunastar's Quest. The site is full of furfags who think that they are incredibly creative because they named their character "Glitterkit" and gave them a tragic past that no one cares about. The site creator, LunaStar, is an uptight Jew bitch who gets butthurt when anyone draws a picture of a cat because she claims to have invented the style in the first place. 



== Kugyay ==


Although of course the worst fucking site of them all is that shitty little thing made on FreeWebs. Kugyay or something? Basically every clan is like one thousand fucking pages long (I kid you not) and every character ever '''SITS IN A CLEARING. HOW HARDCORE'''. Srsly though. The place is infested by '''oldfags, newfags, basement dwellers, girls who are never gonna get some and noobs'''. They spend their time sitting in The Clearing, ignoring eachother and commenting on the weather. Fortunately some fucktards became majorly butthurt about the arrival of nekos and scene kids so Kugyay's retarded younger brother Neko Kugyay was born. It's basically the same except everyone is gay, bi, scene or a noob. The only true difference is that Neko Kugyay is a huge endless gang bang whereas on Kugyay sexing is '''FORBIDDEN''' and if you get caught doing it you will get '''DELETED FROM THE FUCKING INTERWEBZ!!!1!!11ONE!''' Yeah, Kugyay is some hardcore shit. 

Tbh the site used to be '''awwwwright''' until some newfags and otherkin rushed in, causing major butthurt to all the 'legends' (self-proclaimed '''SUPASTARZ''') and making them flee to sites such as YouTube and devianTART. The only decent roleplayers left are little girls who think saying '''*explodez!!!111111*''' and '''CHEESE''' makes them random, trollz ('''WE SALUTE YOU!),''' and ''people no one cares about.'' 

The biggest fag of them all is Viper aka '''Hitler'''. Because Shadowclan just wasn't '''badass''' enough, this furry made itself it's very own site where 3847576383920939572904 'evil' cats gathered to learn how to become Nazis. People still worship him even if he completly ditched this site of his and comes on every 5 months only to tell that he's too tired to lead them all to apocalypse and that he has to take his fuckin pills because he has ADD. They think they are cool and evil when really it's all just a cheap rip off of that '''white furry pirate that no one cares about.''' Butthurt oldfags ('''Boring people''') and attention whore nooblings ('''Mary Sues''') constantly try to take him and the rest of the Hitler Youth but there's just '''so fucking many of them''' that it's literally impossible. The latest attempt was by that '''fat faggot''' called Larkfur or something. He spent like a whole day making an army to pwn the Vipers with but when he did, his faggish rp brother called '''Dare or something''' pwnd him. It is noted that the basement dweller who plays Larkfur was extremely butthurt and ranted on in like '''four fucking journals''' on his/her dA. '''Get a life, faggot.''' Those faggs at viper think they're so badass and that they can decapitate everyone with their magical demon powers. Only no one actually pays attention to them when they're on their murder strikes. Most of the site is actually filled with spams by spammers who have more life than all those noobs begging to join Viper's shit army.

For those who liek teh animal smex check out another shitty site called www.freewebs.com/lovefox-female or '''some shit like that.''' It's a never-ending orgy with things like ''''pEBBLEPAW MOANED WIV PLESUR ND CUMD IN HIS MOUTH'''' and ''''BIG HORNY TOM: *looks around with a boner*'''' I'm not even kidding. Troll the fuck outta this place and just wait for the lulz to come rushing in.

[[image:warriors_fan_series.png|thumb|150px| [[sad|IM THE BIGGEST FAN EVER!!1!]]]]
A breeding ground for all Warriors [[fantards]]. There are [[9001]] videos that are Warrior Cats realated, and all of them are either [[crappy]] slideshows done on [[Windows Movie Maker]], or crappy [[MS Paint]] animations.

'''Sbcatfang'''

Her "animations" consist mostly of butthurt fights and badly drawn AMV's. Along with her own "fans," she roleplays as the fagtard cats, and makes millions of mary sue characters. Her ideas aren't even EVER original, and she copies the 'more famous' "animators'" pictures.She probably was dropped on her head as a kid.

'''AlliKatNya'''

[[13-year old girl|God of the Warrior cats population on YouTube]], [[AlliKatNya]] is one of the worst animators of all time. Her cats look like [[Lady Gaga|anorexic]] rats with tufts of hair, and her animation ideas have been used [[over 9000]] times. [[fantards|People]] tend to [[trace|copy]] her style directly, thinking her style is OMG SO GOOD!! Even [[YOU]] can draw better than this furfag.

'''DarkKokiri'''

Voted most likely to become [[an hero]] in highschool.

'''Frostbitethewarrior'''

Is sbcatfang's bitch.She loves giving blow jobs to her cats , Preferably one named pepper.When she's not getting [[ass raped]] by Sbcatfang she tries drawing mishaped rats and copying Alikatnya's art.. She CAN NOT draw a cat without [[blasting it with piss|drawing one eye closed or lopsided]].If you acuse her of being a side-kick she protests like a [[N00b]]. She pretends to be a higher rank, *Like DarkKorkiri, and some other lame fags* and makes friends with more kitty bitches. If you troll her enough she will pee herself.
Steph: REALLY?
Danny: No Kidding.

'''LisaMini32'''

Is some underaged kitty drawer who can't help but get easily pissed because she has anger problems. She is an hero, according to Dumfuck123LOLZ!'s interview.
