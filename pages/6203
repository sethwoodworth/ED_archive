EPIC FAIL!  Miatanonymous here.  I'm disappointed in you, San Jose!  For a city of <b>OVER 900000</b> people, we should have been able to conjure up more than the 6-8 protesters I saw.  Be there next time and don't punk out!

Major win, but decreased turnout. about 150 people at its peak. There was an unveiling of the Arnie Lerma White Rose anonymous flag, a reading by DisconnectedSon (BAAAWWWW), and a presentation of a Thank You card for the SFPD for being awesome. A sound permit was obtained and we had a big boombox for jams. An anon brought water, muffins, and energy bars. A late night raid also took place around 7pm to disturb a scilon shin-dig they thought they could sneak past us.

'''You all fail''', 48 people is 12 less than last time. Step it up. Minimal scilon activity, they had a class A motorhome, a small truck proclaiming the evils of psychiatry, and another nondescript panel truck right in front of the org. They made a deal with the city that allowed them to not repark them and just feed meters all day long. Cake was had, and some of the VOICELESS actually ordered a shitload of pizza for protesting anons. Win was had with an hero ipod protection device (picture to come), distinct lack of old media. Moar info soon

Anonymous rallied once again in Portland. The turnout was the same as out last time, around 100 anon showing up in grand total. At the most in one time, there were about 75. Just like the last protest, we had to duel another political protest right down the street. This one was against the Olympics in [[China]]. There also were Pro-China protestors as well, and they decided to march. Anon switched gears for 30 seconds to shout "free tibet" at the marchers, before turning their attention back to the CoS. After the protest, anon decided to hang out, and much lulz were had. The CoS in Portland likes to put up propaganda in the windows, this time it said, "free Tibet". Their sign above the door failed, and fell down as well.

<center>The Las Vegas protest commenced around 11AM PST. Anon gathered. A partyvan was on site stocked with water and cake. Aside from private security, there was no police presence. Attendance was down presumably due to conflict with some local weeaboo event. Despite that, lulz and cake were had. Also, we had Lord Xenu as a special guest. He's not as bad as the Scilons make him out to be. </center>

The Reno protest was a lot of fun. We had just as many people this time as we did last time, 15-20. It was a great day and one Anon brought a speaker so rickrolls plus delicious (cup)cakes were had by all. We handed out flyers and marched from our location to the Reno Org. The Org was [[fail]] due to lack of cars and foot traffic, but we did meet a guy who did not claim to be a Scilon but it was pretty obvious he was. He was a nice guy and we had some great debate with him over the practices of the [[Scifags]]. Overall it was a good day, and we all can't wait for the next one. IF ANYONE HAS ANY PICS AT ALL PLEASE UPLOAD THEM. i have a few but not nearly enough and i can't be bothered to upload them right now.
