'''Wild Wolf Society''', otherwise known as the furfag shit-hole of the internet, is just another one of the many hotbeds for [[wolfaboo]]s. It's a fictional [[roleplaying]] site that has somehow survived for ten consecutive years. Despite it's locality to Wyoming, humans have somehow never found the region or imposed on it and if you ask about this, the administrators will end you. The general populace of this filthy rat's nest consists of [[furries]], [[basement-dwellers]], and your occasional [[lesbian]]! No, I'm serious. Even the wolves are lesbians. I'm sure you can imagine the absolute killer parties these guys throw when they're not enacting their sexual fantasies upon this Faggorilla cesspool. Furthermore, their [[losers|virtuous, easy-going members]] manage to drudge up more drama than a bunch of pre-teen girls tossed together with one [[faggot|Justin Bieber]] CD... and most of them are adults!

==The Administrative Team==
[[File:WWS logo.jpg|thumb|right|Awoooooo.]]
Perhaps the shittiest part about WWS is their circlejerk of self-righteous personnel. You know, the dumbshit fat-asses that haven't done anything progressive in their life except for masturbate to their retardedly boring characters and write ridiculously [[tldr|looooong]] posts full of such bullshit you'd wish you were a cow bound for the slaughterhouse. If you're not in cahoots with this winning bunch of home-bred idiots, don't expect to get much of anywhere IC or OOC wise on the site. You'll probably notice that upon close evaluation of the packs, only the ''staff'' are alphas! That's right folks, the only people important are the people ten feet up Houkie's asshole! You'll hold a position about as inconspicuous as [[Jessi Slaughter]]'s virginity  if you're not licking the admin's coochies. Not only are you guaranteed to never be important if your tongue isn't snogging their tight-lipped clown holes, but you're also guaranteed to experience blatant favoritism.

There are four [[Server admin|queen]] furfags. This means that whenever a member wants to take a dump they have to ask permission from four admins. All four are equally bitchy, arrogant, stupid and boring, so it's easy to forget one of them, be it Houkie the retarded egomaniac, Kat the patronizing moron, Nicole the rude newbie, or Akumu who's been at WWS since its conception but who everyone still forgets about because she is so mind-numblingly boring and useless. And if you forget one of them, they all scream and cry with disbelief and annoyance. How could we possibly forget one of these icons of uniqueness? All we wanted to do was take a dump.

It seems to be beyond the administration's comprehension that waiting for four admins to get back to you takes longer than waiting for one. Four times longer to be exact.

The WWS administration insist upon requiring four way permission because they don't want to make one another feel left out or unwanted (even though they all [[Girl Drama|bitch shamelessly]] about one another on LJ and IM anyway), so WWS is being forced to go through four times as much time and effort as required in order to feed the admins's circlejerk. The only members with a scrap of talent are long gone, leaving only butt-feeders. Everyone on WWS actually feels this, which is why MSN WWS chats are the center of dramadom on earth.

Naturally, other than complaining about one another and whining about their precious [[bullshit|rules]], the one thing the admins bitch about the most is how WWS is "just a game". Even though they are four butt-ugly nobodies who were bullied in high school and now jerk off to people who pretend to be their friends because their scared of getting banned.

Should you ever dare to venture to the desolate land that is Wild Wolf Society, keep your ears up, [[furfag|pup]], because you'll more than likely have a run in with the site's tyrannical, batshit insane creator named '''Houkie'''. When she's not busy sniveling over her inability to return to [[Alaska]], she's fapping to pictures of herself like the [[fat|lonely broken soul]] she claims to be. And lest you're wondering, she's currently romantically involved with a cockloaf named '''Wacy'''. That's not a typo; the pussy is actually named Wacy. Not only is this lovely gal particularly [[Waaaambulance|annoying]] with her constant pity-me-[[Tea_Party|tea parties]] but she's also what those on the internet like to refer to as a shitty [[artist|artist]]. If you throw her 30$ of your hard-earned money, she'll make you an atrocious manipulation of your choosing ~ she'll take a bland, boring wolf image that could have been salvageable into something nice and she'll overboard it with shitty brushes and patterns and call it professional art! The money that you could have spent saving puppies from [[Puppy_Pitcher|monsters]] is now going into feeding fat greasy cows! Not to mention this particularly [[Americunts|unskilled]] gal will go around [[Cry_moar|begging]] you to spot her ugly ass some money to support WWS while she has enough moolah to send her ass back to Alaska! If this isn't the epitome of [[furfag|furfag]] panhandling, what in the dear Lord's name is?! [[File:jessiehoward.png|thumb|right|Our super sleuthing skills have led us right to her facebook! Her name is Jessie Howard. What an unfortunate looking toad.]]

[[File:Whatidonteven2.jpg|thumb|right|In case there was any [[Bestiality|doubt]]. Here is Kat doing what [[Dying alone|she does best]].]] [[File:Whatidonteven.jpg|thumb|right|At least it isn't [[Sick fuck|unrequited]]...]]

Next up on the infamous list of [[fugly]] admins is '''Kat''' (Kathleen Loerch) ~ Kat got her position by shoving her tongue so far up '''Houkie's''' tight little asshole that she was probably tasting what [[Fat#Whale|Houkie]] had for dinner last night. '''Kat''' gets so much attention because she is particularly unskilled, equally as dumb, and desperately more than anyone wants to be part of the [[retard|cool-kidz-clan]]. Her characters are bland and unappealing just like Houkie's. Of particular note is her character [[nigra|Sarasvati]] who is as exciting as watching grass grow. So to make her character fit in with the mass of [[retards|morons]] running around she has made Sarasvati lose a paw! If this doesn't get '''EVERYONE'S''' PULSE QUICKENING OHMYGAH WHAT WILL!! Because everyone knows NOTHING is more exciting than [[lulz|DRAMA]] on a site run by adults struck with perpetual tidal complexes!

[[Retard|Kat]]'s particular brand of asshattery is exemplified by her [[fap|belief]] that the people of her beloved Wild Wolf Society like her, when actually some of her favorite furfags like nothing better than to devote group AIM [[Drama|chats]] to the lulz of her disillusion. WWS is tenser than a bodybuilder's [[ass]] as it waits for its admin team to realize how much it is laughed at. Rule #2 of WWS is to lie to the admins because Rule #1 is to lick their dirty cornflakes or get hit with the [[Cock|banhammer]].

Even better than [[fat|Houkie]] and [[ugly|Kat]] is '''Eve''', the self-proclaimed elitist who really just ought to make her living being a professional anal polisher. With characters armed to the teeth in lol-worthy material, it's a wonder at all she's gotten anywhere in WWS, much less life! In her spare time she says she herds cows up and down hills like a [[expert|pro]] but it makes you wonder why she isn't mindlessly cropping grass with them! Eve has also been struck horribly by the ugly-tree, and likes to compensate her ugliness for being a [[Douchebag|holier-than-thou]] wench who really should just invest her time in something more profitable like '''stop breathing'''.

'''Nichole''' is a newer recruit to the battery of fat fuck WWS administration, but she has proved herself to be no less aggravating when it comes down to double-standards and bigotry. Nichole, despite only having three months of WWS [[Virgin|experience]] under her belt, was chucked into relevance when cousin – that's not obvious favoritism, not at all! – Jessie Howard grew bored of her current fleet of desperate kowtowers. And when she's not rolling in Houkie's [[Fat|residual blubber tarnish]], you'll often find her toddling awkwardly and uselessly around the board with nothing better to do than scoot her ass on everyone's faces like a cur with [[Aids|worms]].

==Joining WWS==
Admission into the site is about as easy as pie, thus making it exceptionally easy to troll. That is, unless, you desire keeping any shred of originality you have. Should you stray from the WWS wolf protocol, prepare to be flamed relentlessly and then snarked about on their [[livejournal|livejournals!]]

When joining, you should first be cognizant of their initiation/[[Faggotry|hazing]] process. This usually involves molesting your profile with their judgmental eyes and then rolling their fat asses over to the ''Gossip Thread'' where they will carry out their blowhard complexes and proceed to rip apart your character. That is, of course, assuming they're done advertising their own mundane threads! If you thought that this would be a fun experience, think again.

==Character Imperatives==
Oh ho ho! You thought you could just join WWS with your conventional, tree-peeing wolf? Not so! You must come in at an angle if you expect to be noticed. In order for anyone to reply to your threads or, hell, talk to you, your character must be any of the following:

* '''A Northern Warrior''': Ill-advised unless you enjoy getting ripped a new one by [[self-important|prototypal assholes.]] Everyone likes to think their character is [[original|the best thing under the blessed sun]] and if they even notice a single resemblance they'll be sure to rip your e-asshole so far from your body you'll wonder if it was placed in Mars. But wait, there's more. The decorum for having one of these badass personalities (unless you're a cool and hip somebody) is to be emotionless and callous: that's right, no one has EVER thought of that before! Not to mention if you don't have a Norse name, forget having any semblance of importance there. Finally, for brownie points, bring your character in with a bird familiar! It can be anything: A crow, a vulture. They should also have norse names.  (Applies to male characters only.) [[Image:BobotheWarrior.png|thumb|Those warrior wolves sure are winners!]]
* '''Scarface Incarnate''': Scars, scars, scars! It's all about the scars, kiddo. Scars = hardcore, therefore, your character should have a minimum of at least twenty. If you can stomach it, go wild and [[vagina|split your character's face open]]! The scars MUST be [[vagina|pink]]. No matter how old the scars are, or how thick a wolves' coat is. (Applies to male AND females, but dominantly males.)
* '''The Troubled Alpha Of A Former Pack/ Troubled wolf!!!''': If your wolf wasn't an alpha in a past pack, go home. No, I mean that. Go home because the only way you'll ever be that important is if you're back in your fictional past life. If, like many others, your pack has somehow been exterminated, sulk about it until you're given the opportunity to open up about it to somebody who <strike>gives a fuck</strike> doesn't care. Of even better mention are wolves with [[victim_complex|problems in their past]] because everyone knows that nothing is more interesting than reading about how your boring character got [[aids|railed]] up the ass by a tire-iron. These wolves are especially fun to read because their writers are under the impression that their character's history is  [[emo|interesting]] and thus supplies for a good read. (Applies to both genders.)
* '''Japanese Import''': Despite the illogical circumstances from which these oriental wolves hail, there always seems to be a tidal wave of them. Let's not forget that they are almost always white and can't speak a goddamn lick of [[Engrish|Engrish]]. WWSers will never learn.
* '''A saucy, sultry minx who humps anything with a pulse''': It's also okay to be hypocritical here. If you've previously chided somebody for having a character that gets around, it's totally alright to turn around and slough your own character through a similar situation. (Applies for females only.)
* '''Genetically Modified Wolf''': This wolf is special because so far it's only been allotted to a few especially [[retarded|unoriginal]] characters. Of obvious mention in WWS is that there is '''minimal human''' influence, but if you're important and caressing one of the staff's massively throbbing '''e-dick''' you'll be sure to able to rp one of these wretched creatures! Yup, folks, if you weren't already sick of [[self-important|double-standards]] of ludicrous proportions, well, here's more to dish out. 
* '''EVERYTHING ELSE''': If you're thinking of joining your precious character and it doesn't fit into any of these categories, prepared to be shunned by a fat cow who wields her [[banhammer|banhammer]] in the same fashion a fat kid lovingly carries around a greasy burger. According to tyrannical cunts who think they run shit, you can't have a character that's black, brown, grey, or any sort of color in between. You cant have a wolf with two different colored eyes and you cant have a wolf with personality unless you want to be accused of stealing some village idiot's [[original|boring and uninteresting]] character!

==Biting The Hand That Feeds You==
WWS admins, like the slimy grubs they are, think that by enlisting the help of their devout [[sheep|members]] they are doing the game a favor. That's right. Helping your admins is a ''privilege'' and may god have mercy on your soul should you take advantange of that privilege! One day, these generous old saints took it upon themselves to open a [[Formspring|Formspring]] account in order to vacuum in all those delicious suggestions. Well, that was their initial gimmick anyway. Leave it to one genius to render it with disrepair, leaving lulzy comments calling them out on their bullshit that leaves the admins feeling [[raped|violated]] and [[butthurt]]. Such is the way of Formspring, but leave it to the WWS team to completely disregard any shred of advice from anyone other than themselves! 

When that operation falls through the cracks, we all know it's second best to make a survey asking the members to be honest and open in their suggestions. But, alas, honesty and reversed praise is too much for their brittle souls to handle. When all else fails, [[Rage|RAGECLOSE]] the survey and tuck it into the recesses of the archives where nobody will ever discover the ugly truth.

==The Drama Ensues== 
[[File:Sarasattention.png‎|thumb|right|Sarasvati will go to extreme lengths to make sure you're paying attention to her.]]
If you thought that the drama stopped '''OOCly''', that's where you are mistaken. You see, WWSers have such massive, pulsating e-dicks that it's obligatory that they bask in the unremitting worship from all inferior members. The [[dick|biggest]] prerequisite to this swelling internet erectile phenonemon  is to have a character with an equally huge ego! Of the many, many washouts that inhabit the [[Retarded|sacred]] site, there are a select few who can't help but continually flaunt their veiny e-cocks which are bursting with [[Zoophilia|repressed urges]].

==Extra LOLCOWS for your amusement==
''' Members of honorable mention''': this means these members are '''TRES IMPORTANTE''' and [[USI|if you don't acknowledge/pay attention]] to their throbbing e-dicks your character will be shunned for life like a homosexual at a christening party.[[File:Zinalol.png|thumb|right|[[Lie|a very attractive young female]]]]

'''Zina''' (Rosina Ramirez): At the foremost of self-righteous [[cunts]] we have a particularly unskilled writer with more unoriginal and bland characters. Her wolf is white with yellow eyes and, you've got it, is an asshole in character. Not to mention he's an incestuous freak of nature who fucked his aunt because the [[unoriginal|"dark side"]] took over him. It's probably best to mention that not only is this character a self-proclaimed [[pimp|pimp]] but he's also mated to the tartest hossy you'll ever cross. Furthermore, if you don't recognize her character as something important not only will you bruise her massive ego but you'll probably get terribly snide comments that will pr. much end your e-life. Zina is particularly enamored with her art, and if you don't share the same high opinion of her ridiculously over-priced kindergarten/cave-man wolfeh drawings you'll be sure to flamed extra good 'XDDD' Also to be noted is Zina's effortless ability to act like a complete [[Cocksucker|dickhead]] at any time, whether or not you've got your hands down her trousers. Piss this malformed toad off and you will most certainly be met with a rigid retort, but this is to be expected from an anti-social closet zoophile. Zina frequently has fantasies about wolves boffing each other and has actually written the pathetic, eye-stabbing details of said boffing multiple times. She has even gone so far as to write incestuous threads to express her inner struggles. She is an unfortunate-looking greasy cunt of a person and it would be wrong to suggest that she is human. She's almost like, magic, right? Well that's what her tit-sucking fans think in any case. Zina would be shamed to know that 90% of the online community absolutely hates her. She commonly amuses herself by sucking Houkie's fat e-cock and jamming her sticky thumbs up the asses of powerful moderators like '''Brit'''. Beware of this narcissistic, steaming pile of shit, for she will pretend to be your friend and then pull her two-faced self out and disown you forever, thereby ruining your e-life. Go to her LJ for her bawwwfests about how SHE TTLY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BEING MADE FUN OF LOLOL SHE'S SO ABOVE IT (despite the fact that she checks this article every fucking day and uses it to defend herself, in spite that NOBODY GIVES A FUCK)! 

[[File:kjlolol.png|thumb|left]] '''KJ''': A wolf [[faggot|rpg]] wouldn't be anything if it weren't for the [[sheep|lackeys]] that run around like chickens with their heads cut off just screaming for their [[Basement Dweller|lives]]. And like any proper rpg site, a '''village idiot''' is always in popular demand.  KJ is an annoying and snarky little girl who will bitch about you in her [[Livejournal|diary]] if you don't fawn over the importance of her extremely annoying characters. Not only does she run at the pack of mundane and mediocre characters but she also seems to think no one can have a character similar to hers and if you do well, you'll get a '''free''' feature in her livejournal! KJ is the queen of [[Ragequit|RAGEQUITTING]] and will do so if you don't rise to her expectations fairly quickly. KJ is fervently <b>Pro-Life</b> and [[STFU|SHAME ON YOU]] if you disagree or otherwise discredit her whopping fucking ego. Above all else, KJ owns the Groenendael dog breed and should you have the giblets to use a Groenendael picture, or, LE GASP, make a Groenendael character (shockhorror!!), she'll throw a bitch-fit and huff until you bend to her will and she is once again Princess Of The Groenendaels. (KJ is filed under <i>Certified Ass-Kisser</i>) [[File:KJCow.jpg|thumb|right|Certified Ass-Kisser]]

'''Sonia''': This ginger slag is the poster child for [[Aspergers|Assburgers]], and when she's not whining about her paltry life, she's tonguing WWS's proverbial [[Cornhole|cornhole]]. Not to mention she's a massive furfag and embraces this fact in her fat-rolled arms. She's currently saving up her expenses for a [[Faggot|fursuit]] despite the fact that this makes her [[Cow|utter]] furburger persona come '''full circle'''. Sonia claims that her inner struggles are few, but her [[Livejournal|livejournal]] belies this fact entirely. It seems that every week she has something new to yap about, whether it be about her totally rockin' job at [[Mcdonalds|Mcdonalds]] or how hurtful the people on WWS are. And despite her glaring objection for WWS's conduct (and who could blame her), she currently plays a certain plucky broad named [[Retarded|Salene]]! Salene, a cookies-and-cream [[Ugly|beaut]], fits the term "Mary Sue" like a glove. Self-proclaimed goddess, Salene trumps around Silver Creek with her ass up and her pair of quasi-tits up to her ears. When she's not luxuriating in Zion's kiss-ass lavishing and asspats, she's out on the street corner advertising what her slattern ass has to offer: nothing.  [[Sarcasm|Sonia is no way a murrypurry furfag and you should never, ever grope her at an Anthrocon. Should you do this she might have the grounds to reach down your throat, grab your testicles, and drag them back up through your nostrils...]] but I doubt her fat ass could make the stretch.

==Raging Hypocrisy Parties==
Perhaps the most endearing aspect of this furry rendezvous is the glib nature of their administration: they'll spin some mighty fine fallacies to make themselves sound credible when they're faced with harsh reminders of their [[Ignorance|complete ignorance]]! For a site that seemingly markets itself as a representation of [[IRL|IRL]] wild wolves, they seem to cop-out of that idealization when comes down to your character's [[Confused|sexuality]]! You can't make this shit up. When traversing amongst the vast array (lolnotrly) of personalities, you'll probably eventually find yourself coddled in the moist crotch of a lesbo. Now, before you ask "How the fuck did I get here?", we don't fucking know.  The site is a complete mindfuck and with any luck you'll be [[B&|banned]] for some completely irrelevant shit. Just throwing that out there. Did I mention that aforementioned [[Lesbians|lesbos]] are WOLVES? No, you heard correctly. WWS has a drove of homoerotic wolves, some more closeted than others, but still. If you're uncomfortable with having your eyes fondled by the creepily detailed penning of sexually frustrated girls, I suggest you stop where you are and GTFO the vicinity immediately. Who cares if the explicit read makes you squirm, right? Right? It's all for the greater good? 

'''Wrong'''! You might as well just quit by your own free well, because if you're feeling oppressed or daresay ''violated'' by the threads, God forbid you allude this discomfort to [[Admins|The Royalty]]. They'll just call you a [[pussy|pussy]] and tell you to get thicker skin. Because at WWS, reading furry erotica is a matter of [[Creepy|backbone]]. Don't you tongue your dog's anus too? No, just Houkie and Akumu then? Furthermore, below we have excerpts of some lesbian love makin'! <u>Read at your own peril</u>. 

<center>{{morphquote|Wild_Wolf_Society|background-color: #FFFFFF; width: 500px; height: 200px|font-weight: bold;
|Her dark tail fluttered along the backs of Versailles' legs, teasing at the gap between them with the lightest of tickles. With a wink of her own, she supplanted her face with more kisses.|Ghoti/Jaybird I had no idea wolves had the ability to move their tails in such a versatile manner! How interesting. Also, wolves can kiss? News to me.
|She had allowed herself to delve deeply into their shared pleasure; she drank Ghoti's kisses as if it were the finest wine. Closer toward the source of her passion did the black female traverse, and Versailles made a breathless sound deep in her throat. She was about to admit Ghoti into her sanctum- |Versailles/Ebony Shake it off, shake it off! I know, disgusting huh? Do not want to know the source of this chick's passion. Do. Not. Want. }}</center>

Can we have a collective ''ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww''? These [[Lesbians|fishbreaths]] just consummated on my screen and now I feel like I need to go take a hot shower.

==Characters Of Interest==
It's a well known fact that the characters of Wild Wolf Society are steeped in the [[Semen|jizz]] of their creators, but it's also worthy to know that the wolves themselves have proved time and time again that they can, without much effort, bring teh lulz to the table. We'll give these red-letter forefathers of [[Wild_Wolf_Society|Faggot Land]] exactly what they scrabble for: spotlight! [[file:essieandsven.png|thumb|left|Mein name esk Sven and I am ask Warrior.]]

The center of our attention, and probably the most attention depraved character of them all, is '''Sven'''. Ring any bells? Sven is the white [[stupid|northerner]] who hails from... yep, you guessed it! '''Winterheart Forest'''. When his head isn't jacked up Nightingale's fag end, it's usually sucking on Esmerine's throbbing member. And when he's not sucking on that, he's polishing his own damn whiney hiney for the next photo op. Sven doesn't know much about leading a pack, we've found. In fact, none of the wolves at WWS seem to know jack shit about running a pack. Sven's portrayal of the Beta rank shows to us just how much of a '''controlling bastard''' he really is! Look [[Fugly|sharp]] and behave like a dickhead: that's Sven's motto and he's sticking by it to the bitter end.

One wolf that sticks out among the rest is <b>Bruce</b>. His name leaves an ugly, bitter aftertaste and although he might be  [[Trying too hard|a decent fellow]] beneath his expletive-laden idiocy, it all fell away when he stuck his fat head 200 ft. up Mount Firefly's [[Virgin|virgin]] ass, selling miss [[Bitchcakes|bitchcakes]] Versailles his [[Molested|untainted]] soul.

If you weren't sick already of the powerful norse wolfehs from the [[stupid|north]] then we have more in store for you. Branching off of the verbatim of proverbial bore we have a wolf of particular interest because, (like all the others!!) he is just '''boring'''. After selling his soul to Sven in exchange for eternal ass-clouting, cleansing and the typical kiss-ass rituals, we have '''Mohawk'''. Mohawk isn't really anything exciting, actually, he's nothing special at all except for the fact that he has decided to attach himself to Sven's hip like a leech desperately sucking for trivial attention. Mohawk's creator, Jaq, is a woman of reputed ~fame~ on WWS because she can cop out mediocre graphics that are ~~all the rage~~ in the wild wolf world. Because of her nonpareil lack of talent (both in the internet world and the social one) she has been handed a special place in the circle-jerk as the court jester. Her character is about as exciting as a blank sheet of paper and DAMNED if you don't agree with her because if you don't you just may not ever get a [[lulz|special]] uninspiring graphic from her again. Her character deviants from the norm in the fact that he is extremely uninteresting. Between daily rounds of pissing on random rocks, howling because he ith a warri0r frum the n0rth, and cleansing out Sven's dirty shit-portal it's a small miracle he's been handed the Guardian co-rank.

'''#346''' is another wolf we'll touch on, though not much dirt can be said of this offbeat digit due to his novelty. So far we know that he's been roofied and [[Raped|bum-raped]] by a cluster of [[Winners|people]] on an airplane, then dragged <i>across the Pacific Ocean</i> and dropped off in the middle of Buttfuck, Egypt. As you can probably deduce, this was a massive <u>OMGDRAMAZ</u> move in favor of the writer's arrant [[Sarcasm|creative spirit]]. 

Another wolf we'd like to draw to your limited attention is '''Roheryn'''. With a name full of random retardation and a ooc complex that stems off of neuroticism it will come to you as no surprise that she's desperately vying for your attention. Her character falls in the category of being extra mediocre because it is a character '''with a terrible past''' and between bouts of flirting with unoriginal jackasses from the north and having intercourse with packmembers it should come to no surprise that no one likes her!! With a [[jackass]] personality to boot, be prepared to be flamed on at a daily basis if you don't agree that her character is perfect. Not only does her character reach the pinnacle of the opposite of perfect, but she'll also bitch to you until kingdom come at the turn of every '''rank shuffle''' because her character is ALWAYS being thwarted the rank she deserves!!!

Another character of particular note would be none other than the admin's character herself–'''Esmerine'''! She is the mate of Svaggot and main concubine of his harem. She recently convinced Svaggot to challenge Jazz, compromising her own dignity and dragging him down with her. As was to be expected, they lost and [[Coward|ditched that Popsicle stand]], pussying-out in favor of ousting the squirrels from Maplewood Forest and claiming it as their own. Ooooo, you guys really had to fight for that one! Moreover, when Esmerine isn't painting her nails or blabbing about Svaggot, she's usually bearing down on some poor pack-member and chastising him for pissing on HER dirt. She thinks she's hot-shit... and yet she's modeled after [[Taylor Swift|Taylor Swift]]. Wat? What happened there, Jessie?

More recently, we have been brought up to speed with <b>Versailles</b>, a white French wolf who just [[Sexually Frustrated|can't make up her mind on her sexuality]]. Formerly mated to a nigga named Bronx, that was one affair that didn't last long–she trapped him under a fucking log and flooded their home, thus killing him. Soon thereafter she attempted to off her own son, but was unsuccessful in that endeavor and he wound up in some namby-pamby land where readers were introduced to another nigga named <b>Fish</b>. Well, as it goes, Versailles and Fish hooked up and cooked up a yawn inducing love-interest that lapsed into a drippy "marriage" as they put it, because they're ttly for gay rights and rebelling and shit. However, before this [[Sarcasm|interesting]] union, [[Irrelevant|Versailles had a fresh batch of enfant terribles]]. Moreover, she mostly hates anyone who doesn't kiss her pasty ass and/or bends to her demands. She has been recently crowned as Alpha female of Mount Faggerfly (is that what it's called?) so prepare for more asshattery on her part. Oh, and did I mention the author of the character writes [[Creeper|smut]] and has named her poor child after her fictional wolf? If that's not absolutely pitiful then what on God's green earth is?

Want MOAR hatred? Here's another hot steaming cup of absolute faggotry for you to try to digest. <b>Meagan</b> has been around since the sun but she sure as hell hasn't improved any. If you see her [[shit|posts]] be sure you shut your laptop down immediately before its internal hard-drive shits the bed from viewing such a shitfest. She plays <b>Love</b> mostly but occasionally she'll hop on her BBA-esque characters and plague the board with her stupidity. When she's not smothering <b>Jazz</b> and stroking his dick for the next contending alpha position she's riddling the board with her illiterate and useless posts. 

One we didn't cover yet.. Don't worry <B>Kira</b>, we haven't left you out of the lime-light. I'm sure while your friends were getting all the glory you were absolutely <i>besides</i> yourself green with envy. But fret not, my glory-houndish [[fat|voluptuous]] neanderthal.. since you can't hold a job or amount to anything/get laid I've taken it into my own hands to give your well deserved spot where you too can scream 'PAY ATTENTION TO ME'. To be fair, there's no clue where to start the bashing. Let's begin with WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED KIRA. Kira used to be somewhat decent at posting. Now her posts are just as shitty as the rest of the board's. You'd think she'd hopped on Zina's dick so hard she got a rectal bleeding and it affected her post style. 

Fatalis. Fatalis, Fatalis, Fatalis. What a hideous name to go with an absolute ogre of a person. No, seriously, that's what she looks like. Fatalis has been around as long as the shithole has, and if you haven't noticed SHE hasn't gotten any better either. Her writing style must have emerged from the sewers. There's a common pattern here and it sure as hell isn't improvement. While she's out stuffing her face the rest of the world is stumbling over her posts and trying to figure out what the hell this girl is writing about. She will also treat you like the shit under her feet, because she likes to emulate the dick Admin that she so fervently sucks on.  

And here's a little basement dweller we like to call <b>Nightsky.</b> HEY WHOEVER DID THIS NEEDS TO FINISH IT, DUMB-ASS. Nightsky likes to perpetually scream WRRYY ME about everything and obviously everyone steals her ideas. HERE'S AN IDEA. Do us all a favor and quit the internet, Nightsky, because you're about as relevant as the shit <B>Eve</b> slowly squeezed out of her wrenching rectum last night (and I bet you money Jaq was hovering beneath her with her mouth wide open).  

Above every other dickhead that looms among the smorgasbord of dickheads is the oh-so-pleasant '''Spooky'''! One of Houkie's newer doormats, Spooky has firmly attached herself to the staff's secreting teets – thus earning her a coveted place in the moist cleavage of the Administrator's titties. When she's not sucking on those, she's writing for her [[Emo|über misanthropic puppet]] who was [[Sarcasm|cleverly]] dubbed after Norse Mythology but has somehow picked up the language of Mexican. A hit-it-and-quit-it kind of guy, somehow this toolbag managed to get exiled from Mount Faggery when he reunited with a previous [[Rape Victim|flame]]. As it goes, Sarasvati was green with envy that this monstrosity wouldn't have his way ''her'' and with a butt as hurt as MJ's kids, she kicked his sorry ass out. Of course this only encouraged Spooky to furiously ride Kat's hard-on until she practically shat out a shiny new Alpha title for her butler, and thus Fire Crescent Lake was born. We like to refer to her and all the retards that go there as <b>Flaming Retard Lake</b> residents, given the amount of [[sarcasm|obvious intelligence]] that brews there. One of the first <b>jackasses</b> that will ostracize you if you have a Norse character, Spooky is as good as a writer as she is smart. With <b>run on that go on forever and forever and then stop a little and then go on for another ten years and then run on for a little longer like a marathon runner</b> it's a fucking wonder the dipshit managed an Alpha position. But hey, if you suck enough dick, maybe you'll get in the same place. Also, she thinks she can draw, and like Zina, will charge an absolutely <b>redonkerous</b> price for art that will make your eyes bleed. Oh yeah, this is one of the <i>shitheads</i> that contributed to the closure of the <b>Gossip Thread</b>.

On that same note, WWS has managed to gather a coterie of <i>cunts</i> that are dumb enough to think everyone is infatuated with their characters to the same extent they are. While we're slamming <b>Norse Nobodies</b> let's get on topic with <b>Loki</b>. This maggot somehow managed to crawl her way into the comforting and smelly hole of some Admin's swollen anus and has landed herself spot on the Activities staff along with the <u>retard we mentioned above</u>. Like all her Norse-nobody counterparts, Loki leads an [[exciting|lie]] life where she perpetually polishes out Sven's asshole. We can't tell if when she dinks around the board if she's being serious or not, but her comments on the <u>Gossip</u> thread have left everyone wondering ... <i>where the fuck is this hag's brain?!</i> Not only that, but, who the fuck is responsible for <b>bringing her onto this earth?</b> The same retard that produced all the other Norse retards? Everything she contributes is beyond <i>ignorant</i>, and... speaking of ignorant...

<b>SAGAXUS!!!!!!!!!!</B>  Ohoho boyo I bet you didn't think we'd talk about you? This kid is something else. He joined and started bitching like a girl with a elephant tampon lodged up her ass. Scotty is as dumb as a sack of bricks, and his comments left on the thread rival Loki's. This is the idiot that thought he could challenge alphas (LOLOL NOT SO, SEE BELOW!! You must first kiss some serious Houkie-heiny first!!!) and then threw a pissy fit when he couldn't. Did we mention his character carries around a necklace that has a crystal in it? All we can say to admins is <b>"Who left the gates open and let a retard wander in?"</b>  Oh, and word of advice: tuck a tampon and quit your bitching Scotty, because if it were up to half the members on WWS, your ass would have been banned a month ago.

==The Double-Standard Phenomenon==
WWS hosts double-standard parties out the wazoo. When they're not sucking eachother's tits, usually the higher ranking members are found to be marinating in their elitist privileges. Among these privileges: fighting for the alpha rank. The dickbutt admins, being stuck in their perpetually parvenu ways, take the game so fucking [[Joke|seriously]], that in the history of <i>ten years</i>, there has never once been an Alpha that hasn't been subjected to the sucking of Houkie's [[Burger King|greasy fat rolls]]. In fact, if you're not one of her palsy-walsy gigolos, you won't ever stand the chance of even <i>challenging</i> for a higher rank. Except for Houkie and her friends. Not you. Houkie and friends. Did you hear that? <u>Double standard up to the rafters</u>.  

Let's take for example our current event in the WWS: <b>Sven</b>, the dishwater asshat that we [[Repeatedly|briefly]] mentioned earlier, has risen to the occasion of contending with <b>Jazz</b>, current Winterheart Forest big-man. Somewhere in the back of Sven's mind, he was led to believe he would be an astute rival for the capable alpha male and was further encouraged by–yep you guessed it–<b>Esmerine</b>! Can you guess who plays this stupid hag? Ding ding ding! [[Asshole|Houkie]]. Somewhere in the grand scheme of things, Eve bullied her way into Houkie's good graces and as such, the fire-assed twatbird wielded her magic admin-hammer to force Gerra into letting Sven challenge so he can be Emperor Of The Assgoblins.

As it turns out, Houkie will <i>never</i> settle for sloppy-seconds, so she decided to let [[Faggot|Jazz]] keep his piece-o-shit lot and decided to [[Swiper no swiping|swipe]] some place called Maplewood Forest. How anticlimactic and [[Ghoti|gay]].

{{quote|Characters may fight or spar.  No rank or mate challenges unless previously arranged with all participants and the Administration.|The rules according to the the admins.}}


{{quote|Characters may catfight.  No rank or mate challenges unless you're sucking my cock or worshiping me profusely. Also, it helps if you're my character's mate!|The rules according to everybody else.}}

==Oh no! They found us!==
When the darlings finally followed the cupcake trail to this article, they tried to keep it on the DL. Unfortunately for them–Livejournal exists! And twitter! We also got some insider dirt thanks to an Anonymous [[Lurker|source]] with teh leg1t hack0r skillz. The ones afflicted by the article are too [[Lazy|cool]] for BAWWWW and thus decided to take the <b>old tool road</b> and tried to play it off [[Denial|like this article didn't even effect them]] but later revealed via twitter how [[Aroused|appalled]] they were that people on the interwebz could be so MEAN!!! (Except for Ghoti's player, Jaybirdbirdfag, who lamented her desires to [[Crybaby|quit]] the [[Overreaction|entire site]]) They must be used to the hate. What a surprise. 

An indirect quote from Jessie herself:

{{quote|[[Denial|I'm above da haterz. In fact, I care so little that I'm going to make one of the pictures into an avatar, hehe. Won't they be surprised when I don't rage! LOLOL My cleverness is making me hot and bothered.]]|Houkie/Jessie Howard, being "above" the haters. That must be a new thing for her, being [[Zoophilia|ABOVE]] something. Isn't that right, Wacy?}}

All the other sheep followed suit, implementing their lovely dedications in some way shape or form to the site, despite the fact that the artfags who drew the pictures cannot see them to feel bruised anyway. Good job girls, you have mastered [[Butthurt|Butthurt]] like a pro!

On '''Saturday, October 16 2010''' the admins tried to take away possible material for this article by [[Pool's_Closed|'''SHUTTING DOWN EVERYTHING''']]! Oh, yeah, you sure showed us out the door. Leave it to Houkie et al to believe that they are wearing the pants in this online relationship. Well ladies, as they say in Layman's terms, [[Your_resistance_only_makes_my_penis_harder!|YOUR RESISTANCE ONLY MAKES MY PENIS HARDER!]] Keep resisting, we'll keep fapping... and then we'll add more shit that makes us giggle. So, with all that said and done, we formally invite you to [[Cry_Moar|CRY MOAR]]!!!!

==People that need to be talked about==
If you have any damage with anyone on WWS go and edit your own piece because this is a GOD-DAMNED FREE FOR ALL. WRITE about the below if you know about them :) :))))
