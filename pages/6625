Programming language
{{haxor}}
[[At least 100 years ago]], some [[h4x0r]] named [[Alan Turing]] used his [[Rice out#Two|heavily-modded]] [[old media|cassette recorder]] to [[proof|prove]] that all possible ways of [[hacker|hacking]] halfway-worthwhile [[crap]] on a [[computer]] are actually the same.  Since then, it has of course been critical for [[nerd]]s to [[advocacy|determine which one is teh best]]. [[Msdn]] also hosts many other programs used for [[hack]]ing into [[people]]'s private lives/[[LJ]]s.

In all, programming language is the reason why some [[basement dweller]] in Connecticut can sneak onto your computer and steal the picure of you [[furry|masturbating in your raccoon outfit]] and post it on [[4chan]] therby destroying your life.
