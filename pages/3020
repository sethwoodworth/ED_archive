'''"...for great justice"''' is a [[mini meme]] offshoot of the [[All Your Base Are Belong To Us]] meme where [[mundane]], everyday tasks are made more funny by adding the suffix '''"...for great justice"''' to a directive, invitation, or announcement.  It is generally assumed that a person using this phrase (or any other meme) has nothing of [[lulz|real value]] to express.

Examples:

{{squote|I'm going to go take a shit '''...for great justice.'''}}

or.. 

{{squote|I'm 32 and I still live with my mother '''...for great justice.'''}}

or.. 

{{squote|You must [[goatse]] the forum '''...for great justice.'''}}

or.. 

{{squote|I will [[baby fuck|fuck this baby]] '''...for great justice.'''}}

Like all mini-memes, as [[time]] will tell, this will become old meme as soon as it used more than once.

== Possible Origins ==

Since the text is taken from the opening cut scene of the 1991 [[Europe|European]] [[Sonic|Sega Mega Drive]] version of the japanese game Zero Wing, [[some argue]] it's the same '''''"For Great Justice"''''' catchphrase used by the [[fail|japanese hero]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rapeman Raepman] edited from 1985 to 1992. (I refuse to pipe that).

== Meme-bombing ==

"For Great Justice" is the name of [[User:Davekov]]'s collegiate senior thesis. Making it, perhaps, the first meme ever printed on the diploma of an accredited university.

== Variations ==
* [[fursecution|Fur great justice!]]
