Pro-Ana
{{WP80}}

The Pro-Ana/Pro-Mia internet movement is a haven for young women and those of an [[emo]]tional persuasion who have trouble distinguishing a diet from an eating disorder. Those who involve themselves in this movement have been found to also not know the difference between a lifestyle, a disease, and a religion. Characterised by constant [[butthurt]], masses of [[flaming]] and [[trolls]], being unable to move for [[moralfags]] and an unholy amount of [[16 year old girls]], the average pro-ana website takes everything bad about [[the internet]] and adds it to pretending to have a serious mental disorder. At least it's scant on [[memes]].[[Image:Thinspiration.jpg|right|thumb|DO NOT WANT|Go ahead, pinch an inch]]

==The Concept==
[[image:Not_ana.jpg|right|thumb|Just because you're not fat, doesn't make you anorexic. Also [[OMG]] this girl is hideous.]]
There are several concepts relevant to the pro-ana community, and several distinct factions. They are as follows:
===The Lifestyle===
People who believe that anorexia is a choice and is nothing more than an extreme diet. Often talk about drinking [[shit|shitloads]] of [[piss|green tea]] (see:[http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Redbraclet.png  pic in Gallery]), because they think it'll help them lose those [[fat|last 3 pounds]]. Usually [[scene]] girls, and usually hot despite their attention seeking, [[sick fuck|it is completely normal to simultaneously hate and fap to them.]] So don't worry.

===The Victims=== 
People who believe they genuinely have anorexia, though rather than get the [[Dr. phil|professional]] help they need choose to whine on messageboards, profiles and forums. Characterised by a tendency to slip between avid defense of the community and tantrums begging other people to get help and blaming their peers for their general [[fail|failure]] at life. Genuinely believe that pro-ana websites are a valid support network and a means of dealing with their issues.

===The Fangirl===
Has a fairly normal diet with occasional attempts at losing a few pounds. Likes the attitude of the trashy scene ana girls and wishes she was like them, so tries to fit in even though her parents [[Lie|are monitoring]] her [[internets]] time and will send her to therapy if she looks at any [[NSFW]] images.
[[Image:Thingirl.jpg|right|thumb|I do not care how ill you are I would [[fuck]] you with all the [[furry|fury]] I possess.]]
===The Fatgirl===
As above, but replace "a fairly normal diet" with "masses of fatty food and zero exercise". Pretends to be both a lifestyle ana and a victim of the disorder. Wishes she was anorexic, but will always be a McDonalds botherer.

===The Worst Kind===
Believe that anorexia is a religion. [[Cult|Worship]] "Ana", supposed goddess of skinny folk. Have chants and wear red bracelets to signify that they are [[batshit]]. Love the shitty band Silverchair. Have poems and songs and all manner of pseudo spiritual validations of their lifestyle. Ridiculously easy to troll.

==Wannabes??==
It's a major [[Facepalm]], when [[Lolis|Children]] wanna join in:

==Celebrities and Anorexia==
[[Image:Poshspice.jpg|right|thumb|Posh Spice, aka Victoria Beckham has a well documented eating disorder. It seems to work for her.]]

Of course celebrities love a good eating disorder. Lots of publicity, plus [[Chris Crocker|one faction of adoring fans]] screeching that everyone should leave you alone because you [[lie|have a naturally high metabolism]], and the other screaming that [[OMG|THE MEDIA MADE YOU DO IT!!11!]]. Either way, the celebrity inevitably makes hundreds of thousands of dollars off of it, and you buy the long awaited no-holds-barred memoir.

Some celebrities with reported eating disorders:

* Mary-Kate or Ashley - An enemy of [[PETA]], Mary-Kate Olsen's eating disorder was widely reported throughout 2004. One fat and one skinny twin = LOL.
* Posh Spice - A follower of the "Skinny Bitch" diet, the former spice girl and full time moocher has been dubbed Skeletal Spice by the media and reported as anorexic/bulimic for over 10 years.
* Karen Carpenter - American musician who died at 32 years old weighing less than 80lbs, worshipped by many anas.

== The Silliness Continues ==
[[Image:Beatanorexia.jpg|right|thumb|If this guy can beat it, so can you]]
Those who are pro-ana believe that [[No|anorexia is not harmful and is a lot like getting a tattoo.]] They are only correct in this assumption if the tattoo needle is infected with [[AIDS]] from the last customer, the tattooist is a giant [[bear]] named Moe, and the tattoo is of the phrase "[[batman|Holy fucking idiocy!]]" tattooed across their very visible rib cages.

[[Fact|Indisputable proof]] that anorexia is a disease is easily found in the title: "pro-ana." The lack of nutrients flowing to their brains obviously keeps them from realizing that it's an'''o'''rexia and not an'''a'''rexia. Or something. Actually, that's no good. Forget the title. Indisputable proof that anorexia is a disease is easily found in [[Fact|common sense and unanimous medical opinion.]] The lack of nutrients flowing to their brains obviously keeps them from realizing that they are [[retarded]].

When these pro-ana girls find out meds such as Adderall can suppress hunger they immediately schedule appointments with their pediatricians. Suddenly every self-conscious girl "needs help focusing", or is "bouncing off the walls hyper". If there are at least 5 or more functioning braincells left in the pro-anas' head they skip the doctor and do the most logical thing possible:  they hold a pharmacist hostage until they are supplied with Adderall, or another hunger suppressor. Of course, the pharmacist would have to be either a legal midget or an armless degenerate if they are incapable of defending themselves against an [[16_year_old_girl|80 pound skank]].

However, there is still a silver lining to this disease, at least for [[fat|those of us who don't have it]]. An anorexic girl will stop having her period, since her body is so starved for any form of nourishment it will withhold any form of biomass it can (except for [[shit]]ting, on the rare occasions they have enough food in their system after purging), and this includes ovulation/menstrual blood. Basically, for however long they are [[stupid]] enough to be actively anorexic, pro-ana girls are sterile. Not that it matters, since if a pro-ana girl got pregnant, either the baby would die from malnutrition or she'd get an [[abortion]] because '''God forbid''' she gain 10 pounds. Either way, natural selection wins, and these girls can not breed. Also, if you happen to be a [[chris hansen|pedophile]] but don't feel like going to jail, dating a pro-ana girl would be a good idea. You can have a [[skank|girlfriend]] with the body of a loli, with her zero tits/curves but still be dating someone over the age of 18. It's win win!


==[[LiveJournal]] and Anas==

And some other communities too... But mostly [[LJ]].

There are [[Ana 4 avril|pro-ana websites]] all across the [[Internets]]; they are easily found by searching for "pro-ana" or "no1 undrstandz me :'(" or "purging tips pls 911!!!" The [[LiveJournal]] community of the same name, {{ljcomm|pro_ana}}, is one of the most prolific.[[Livejournal]] is the home of Anas everywhere, who can talk shit with no fear of retribution and compare weights with middle aged [[England|paedophiles]] pretending to be [[16 year old girls]].

[[Image:Streettrashana.jpg|thumb|The weight all pro-anas aspire to.]]

*'''something-fishy'''&mdash;Run by [[nazi]]s. This board is for recovering only, and is [[unfunny]]. Numbers are replaced with asterisks because knowing someone else's weight might make a [[lol wut|fishy suicide]]. Making a thread to exchange hug emoticons is also against the rules, because it might make a fishy feel left out and [[suicide|make a meaningful contribution to society]]. Any post has a 79% chance of causing suicide. Dr. Phil recommends it.

*'''TF'''&mdash;Filled with [[fail|drama]], but insanely repetitive. Most of the posters there are [[old]] now, and don't post about [[vomiting]] or starving much anymore. There is a forum specifically for flames, and that's the only real reason why anyone goes there. TFers are almost always [[vegans]], [[liberal]], and [[stupid]]. 

*'''P.A.S.S.'''&mdash;stands for Pro-Ana Suicide Society. Full of [[16 year old girls]] who get [[raped]] by the entire football team, their doctor, a teacher, their principal, and [[your mom]]. Anyone questioning stories of surprise sex is banned.  

*'''{{ljcomm|user=Purgatorium}}'''&mdash;A LiveJournal community that once kicked out a tranny troll for being overly supportive for far too long.  Now at '''{{ljcomm|user=the_purg}}''' ( lol the [http://tinyurl.com/2vudnda account has been purged] )&mdash; because purg_chic deleted the original.

*'''{{ljcomm|user=Proanorexia}}''' &mdash;A LiveJournal community once run by a [[suicide|suicide case]], and later transferred to a [[pedophile|55 year old]] man. Currently the "World's Largest Pro Anorexia Site".

*'''{{ljcomm|user=24_7_posting}}''' &mdash;A LiveJournal community under the same umbrella as ProAnorexia. It's mostly filled with [[fat|wannarexics]] and college kids who think they are the [[shit]], when really they're all [[fail|mocked]] on communities they didn't know existed.

*'''Life Beyond EDs'''&mdash;A LiveJournal recovery community run by the scrawniest, gayest, eating-disorderiest transvestite on the net, Johnnysboysriot. Johnny frequently uses kittens, rainbow brite, and sparkles in his saccharine-sweet motivationals.

*'''{{ljcomm|user=AnorexicQueen}}'''&mdash;A [[LiveJournal]] community known for having at least 98% [[Virgin|wanna-anas]] making up its membership. Not very active any more, [[cry|closed]] [[fail|membership]] and posting.


*'''{{ljcomm|user=pro_ana}}''' is mostly populated by [[retarded|impressionable]] girls between the ages of 13 and 18, with the occasional [[faggot|"ana boi"]] prancing in to show off his femi-hipbones (there used to be an older crowd, but they are now in [[death|graves]]).

[[Image:Liberianchild.jpg|thumb|More typical thinspiration.]]
After repeated [[trolling]], including the notorious and yet-unsolved [[Sansgras]] incident, the community and its many spinoffs have become pretty much closed to new members.  Often new members must post applications, like in [[rating communities]].  New members may be rejected on the basis of too high a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index BMI], [[fauxlimia]], or having a "cliché" [[thinspiration]] such as [[Mary-Kate Olsen]].  Much like rating communities, an "accepted" or "rejected" [[image macro]] is then bestowed upon the applicant. 

[[Image:Anabonesreject.jpg|thumb|left|"Rejection" [[image macro]] from a pro-ana community.]]
[[Some argue]] that anorexia and bulimia are the results of a fear of fat people. However, LiveJournal and [[California]] both have large populations of both fatasses and anas. Anas are as much to be avoided [[IRL]] as BBWs, since both give off pungent stenches of sweat and vomit, both grow hair on their backs, and both are likely to have massive heart failure and die on you at any time. When not vomiting, asking for purging tips or being catatonic, anas like to spend their time trolling celebrity blogs like that of well-known fatty [[Perez Hilton]] as they are [[butthurt]] by their own inability to eat.

==Drama==

Billions of trolling sites exist, one of the best being [[LiveJournal]]'s fabled [[Ana 4 avril]]. There are also sites dedicated to bash these [[fail|ANAAZ]], such as {{ljcomm|user=lol_anaz}} but they're really just Pro Anas in denial and fail just as hard if not harder than the ANAAAAAAAAZ.

*'''{{ljcomm|user=proanorexia}}''' was a popular Ana paradise. It's history with maintainers is quite [[lol|tragic]]. It was occasionally moderated by a laxative bulimic and crack addict with a criminal record for beating the shit out of her own mother until mid-to-late 2006, when it was transferred to Kristi4, who then committed [[suicide]] on January 27th, 2007 after finding herself unable to deal with the sheer volume of nitwits. The moderator of the bulimia acceptance community then [http://community.livejournal.com/purgatorium/4433540.html accused Kristi4 of making the whole thing up] without bothering to do any checking that would require her to actually get out of a [[chair]] to dial anyone on the phone, resulting in great drama. LJ passed on teh boss hat to Kristi's good friend, Josie, who tried to moderate but resulted in [[fail]]. It was then when [[User:Eljay dramatica/Not this planet|DYLAN]] begged to take over. Dylan was named the new maintainer and all anAz worshipped him. He created his own community {{ljcomm|user=dylans_corner}} to tell anaZ how to better kill themselves. He then quit his job in order to help the poor unfortunate aNaZ, opened a suicide hotline, and become teh AnAz God. He then began [http://community.livejournal.com/lol_anaz/267372.html charging money] for membership to PA under his "[http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/1596/44538886.jpg Help a Girl Get Better]" scheme (major failz!). All at the blooming age of 59! Creepy? {{ljcomm|user=dylandetective}} thought so too. They worked to get info on the [[pedophile]]. After his handy double agent moderator {{ljcomm|user=justtryingtofly}} told him they were on to him, he continued moderating under a new account, {{ljcomm|user=sarjmarteen}}, and refusing to answer any questions as to where Dylan went, who this new maintainer was, and the fate of their poor AnAz LJ lives. In April 2009, {{ljcomm|user=dylandetective}} trolled both ProAnorexia and 24_7_posting, and finally interrogated "Lauren" (500+ comments AND they got a nose, an ear and a lip ;)). That was the last we heard of Lauren, Sarjmarteen, or our dear Dylan. Enough information gathered, the authorities were notified and Dylan was imprisoned. The community is currently being moderated by superwoman ({{ljcomm|user=fighting2win}}) who is trying to tend for those who's posts are not eaten by unicorns or those who create cotton candy bracelets as a means to connect to the sites colours.

==Trolling==

There are many ways to troll pro-anas. The best ones are to tell them they are fat. Even though any rational person can tell that they are far from fat, these girls will take it to heart [[batshit insane|because of their disorder]].

*"Have you put on weight? You look good!" (they won't think so)
*"You only ate a crouton all day? Hm...are you sure you even needed the crouton?"
*You can also attack their other physical features that might be lacking because of their disease. For example, anorexics have bad skin, are balding, and their skin is yellow.
*Tell them they have no boobs, therefor, are not a valued member of society
*Tell them no reasonable person would find them attractive
*Tell them that a lot of people would prefer to fuck a whale than a skeleton. At least whales have warmer pussies. 
*Tie them down and force feed them lard.
*Tell them about Jesus. All religious people despise other religions.

== The Truth ==

Despite everything above and what everyone else says, the fact is that most pro-ana girls are disgustingly fat.  Most of them could be pretty, if not for the fact that they have 10 or 20 pounds of horrible repulsive fat on their bodies, which they are too piggish and lazy to lose.  Their friends and family are typically aware of this, but are too nice to say anything about it.  If they would just exercise more and eat less, they could finally have an attractive body, but these lardasses refuse to do so, and keep thundering around grossing out everyone who has to look at them.  Sadly, there is probably no hope for them.
