{{quote|Now, I will give the most anticipated answer for an Aion player, and for NCsoft. What's wrong with Aion? Why does everyone flee away?

'''''Aion''''', also known as ''[[moonspeak|タワー オブ アイオン]]'', ''[[what|아이온: 영원의 탑]]'', ''Lineage II with Wings'', and ''[[azn|Land of the Chinese Gold Farmers]]'', is another [[shit|MMO]] made by [[Korea]]’s version of [[Blizzard]], NCsoft. If [[you]] really liked ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', or any other MMO for that matter, then you’re in luck. With ''Aion'', you won’t be leaving your basement anytime soon, as the developers have made a game that would have graphics that would be as [[blu-ray|realistic]] as a fucking movie, but have content as interesting as a [[Sonichu]] comic.<br/><br/>After ripping off the CryEngine used for ''[[Crysis]]'' graphics, the game developers decided gameplay didn't need to be unique or different from other games. People would only be allowed to complete content in their shiny new mmo and get much needed Internet fame if they had dedication. So, if you aren't willing to give up your life savings and several thousand hours in playtime, then you're out of luck. The plot and gameplay don’t really make any sense in the beginning either, and as [[you]] slowly wrap your head around how the game works, [[you]] soon realize that you will be sitting in your chair for a LONG time. The community is not much help either, as it 50% gold spammers, 25% [[13 year old boys]], and 25% [[Chris Hansen|pedos]].
==The Gameplay==

{{frame|{{morphquote||background-color:#ffffff; width: 700px; height: 210px;|font-weight: bold;

|This was carefully crafted by NCSoft to screw you over.|Kold

|RNG is the great equalizer. It makes it so that poor players progress exactly as fast as the skilled players (And skilled players have no way of pulling ahead). That's exactly the logic that Candyland uses - it's a great game for kids because there is no strategy, they're likely to win and lose just as often as the parent playing with them. For the adults, though, it's really sort of pointless.|-SirNiko 

|RNG is a really bad way of "adding challenge" becuase its about luck not about skill or tactics. Basiclly, instead of rng aion should have made a better combat and movement coding/engine and made alot of posistional, reactionary, situational, and other styles and abilities.|Jetrpg - www.mmorpg.com

==How to Play==

{{quote|[[fact|Fact]] is that Aion hands some people their shit on a silver platter and punches others in the balls.|Beefcake}}


*[[Pokémon|Grind]] to level 18.
*Grind to level 50.
*Complete all of the [[shit|campaign quests]].
*Do the [[Cock|long and hard]] Fenrils/Miragents chain quest to get all of the [[Jewgold|epic]] PvE armor set.
*Once you get the last piece of the [[shit|awesome]] PvE armor set, the credits will then come in and roll meaning that you have [[Winrar|completed the game]] of ''Aion''!
*[[Kill yourself]].

==Races & Classes==
[[File:Aion_races.jpg|thumb|right|The good guys and the bad guys.]]
[[File:typicalass.jpg|thumb|right|Typical [[Scene|Asmondian]] Player]]
[[File:Prussianblue.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Typical [[White supremacist|Elyos]] Player]]

===Races===
*'''[[Jesus|Elyos]]''': High elf-angel hybrids. [[Amuria]] draws these often. They're more ''[[Final Fantasy]]''-ish than the other race...

*'''[[Black|Asmodian]]''': They're essentially dark elves. With dark skin and so-totally [[goth]] getup, they are a favorite of "[[hardcore]]" players with "badass" characters.

*'''[[Jews|Shugo]]''': They're the [[Jews]] of Aion because manly all of the NPCs in Aion that sells, buys, auctions items are [[Jews|Shugos]], it is a rumor that the war between the [[Jesus|Elyos]] and the [[Black|Asmondians]] started because the [[Jews|Shugos]] knew there would get some [[Jewgold|profits]] if they had a war going on...those fucking [[Jews|Shugos]].

*'''[[Zerg|Baluar]]''': [[Zerg]] rip-off looking creatures which are the true bad guys, but if the Jew didn't say to the Baluar that [[Adolf Hitler|Aion]] was going to plan a [[Nazi|mass genocide]] on them, this whole war wouldn't have started in the first place, it goes to show that the Jew are the true bad guys.
===Classes===
*'''[[white knight|Templars]]''':<br/>Being the "[[white knight|tank]]" class of the game, these guys have ridiculous defensive abilities that no one can really match, and in most mmos, these abilities are only useable in pve. Thanks to the broken, disfigured mechanics of ''Aion'' though, templars are also one of the best pvp classes. For example, when an enemy tries to run away, the templar takes out his [[BSDM]] whip and forces him to come back for some painful, violent sex that can't be prevented. This is considered balanced in ''Aion'' though, as most people are concentrated on the 10 year leveling process.

*'''[[Guido|Assassin]]''':<br/> A class that depends on stuns just like what a [[guido]] heavily depends on using [[%27Roids|roids]] to attract [[fags]] for a [[anal sex|good time]]. Assassins are only good for [[raping|rifting]], and [[Gangbang|DPSing]] the hell out everything and using stealth to surprise those [[fags|carebears]] PvEr's and making them [[butthurt]] and spam LFG [[BAWWW|that they can't level and attain epic PvE items]]. Assassins are also the [[ginger|red heads]] of the Rangers because of the fact that they will be <s>[[Over 9000|OP]] in the upcoming patch 1.9</s>, actually the Assassins are screwed in 1.9 because the [[guido|skilled players]] found out that the Assassins are a [[shit|pure skill class]] and they are nothing without their precious [[%27Roids|stuns]], feel free to reroll on a Sorc as it will become the [[Overrated|FOTM]] class.

*'''[[aspergers syndrome|Gladiators]]''':<br/>A class somewhat comparable to an [[autism|autistic]] squirrel with two broken legs, a gladiator is like the [[fucktarded]] cousin of the [[rapist|assassin]] and the unwanted stepchild of the templar. If you want your playtime being defined by frustrating battles comparable to a [[pedo bear|small animal]] facing off against a F-22 fighter jet, then the gladiator might be for you. Everything kills them. Assassins? Yep. Templars? Yep. Ants? Yep.

*'''[[douchebag|Rangers]]''':<br/>Nicknamed ragers because all they do is cause other people to [[rage]], rangers are the overpowered, broken character favored by the sweaty, pimple faced [[13 year old boy|teens]] and [[internet tough guys]] playing the game. They are the “[[jock]]” class and if you pick one, [[internet|everyone]] automatically equates you to being a monumental [[douchebag]]. But if you want to troll the fuck out of people and make life hard for everyone else, pick a ranger.

*'''[[goth|Spiritmaster]]''':<br/>If you’re a 13-year-old [[goth]] who spends his time listening to [[Slipknot]] and Children of Bodom [[irl]], then this might be the class for you. The angsty, [[emo]] counterparts of the superior sorcerers, spiritmasters cast [[aids|evil spells]] and control a variety of walking sex toys. While other classes are busy attacking the giant vibrators and pocket pussies, the [[goth|spiritmaster]] puts his [[aids|dots]] on them. If his [[aids|dots]] succeed in killing the target, the spiritmaster has the option of having violent sex with the dead body as is the norm in goth culture.

==Leveling==

{{quote|The people that say "There is no grind go back to WOW" are the people this game was aimed at. Idiots.| Deezlar of Aionsorce}} 


''Aion'' is like every other MMO in that to get to the actual [[dragons|content you care about]], you have to spend weeks [[faggotry|leveling up as high as possible]]. In any [[Final Fantasy|standard RPG]], leveling or progression steadily increases by about 10% or 20% per level. This causes a more [[tits|enjoyable]] game because the player isn't [[rape|overwhelmed]] by sharp increases. [[math|If the expreience points necessary to level up double for every level gained]], it leaves the impression that the [[cake|carrot]] is unreachable.<br/>NCsoft has done exactly this. With 75% of the game taking place between levels 40 and 50, they're essentially forcing you to grind tens of thousands of monsters after 45 with no other content.

[[Image:Aionxpcurve.jpg|frame|center|As seen above, ''Aion'' takes a unique approach to gaining experience.]]

[[Truth|Not to be outdone by their competitors]], NCsoft hyped the ever-living shit out of ''Aion''. We're not talking advertising here, we're talking thousands of [[Fanboy|''Aion'' Fanboys]] spamming their ever loving MMO on every MMO forum out there raving how amazing the game will be, and how it is going to be the ultimate [[World of Warcraft|WoW]] killer. Many people will tell you that NCsoft didn't send these people but anyone who tells you that is a [[faggot]] [[Fanboy|''Aion'' fanboy]].

The [[Fanboy|''Aion'' Fanboys]] with their constant [[spam|spamming MMO forums]] did however convinced the [[basement dwellers|denizens]] of these MMO forums that they were telling the truth that [[lie|NCsoft is indeed the best MMO company out there]], but if you did played ''[[City of Heroes]]'', ''[[MMO|Lineage 2]]'', and the many other [[shit|great title games NCsoft hosts]], and if you weren't a [[retard]], then you would know NCsoft is widely considered as one of the worst MMO companies out there (who have the money to be worth a shit),  producing the biggest grinding curve in every pay to play games they produce and had a horrible reputation before Aion. But of course, when the game turned out to be [[shit|horse shit]], Everyone was surprised because the [[Fanboy|Aion fanboys]] did their damn job of over hyping this shitty [[MMO|''Lineage'' clone game with wings]].

But the [[drama|fun]] doesn't stop there! Although they have a smaller western player base than ''[[Free Realms]]'', ''[[Gaia Online]]'', and ''[[Age of Conan]]''; Aion-Source, the [[fanboy|Aion Fanboy]] place to be at has an endless supply of [[lulzcow]] worthy drama waiting for [[EDiot]]s to milk the shit out of.
 
===Short Timeline of ''Aion''===
[[Image:Awesomereview.png|thumb|Typical [[fanboy|''Aion'' fanboy]] review]]
[[Image:Google_Aion.png|thumb|[[The Google|Google]] never lies]]
[[File:Eq2flames_meta_aion_truth.PNG|thumb|[[EQ2Flames]] user Meta explains to a fanboy.]]
''Note'': Everything mentioned below is still [[drama]] on the forums. Even 11 months later, that's how [[butthurt]] these [[fanboy|Aion Fanboys]] are.

*'''[[shitstorm|Launch Day]]''': <br/>I hear you say to yourself: "How can they possibly fuck up launch day? They knew the exact number of preorders because they worked with [[GameStop]] and tracked it on their website on a counter they bragged about! [[Impossible|It would be impossible to not have enough capacity!]]" And you would be right, but you're also not NCsoft. NCsoft knew they would have [[over 9000|at least 500k players]] on their first two days because of preorders, but they purposly capped servers at 25% capacity, and made 9 hour queues on most servers. Why? [[For the lulz|They did it for the lulz.]], and to [[troll|troll hard]] a lot of eager players to play Aion which ensued mass [[butthurt]] in the forums afterwards.

*'''[[Cake|Misleading Beta]]''': <br/>We're talking ''[[Age of Conan]]'' quality here folks, but then again NCsoft took this whole [[crap]] to a whole new level. Just like [[shit|Funcom]] [[lie|another great MMO company that will overtake Blizzard someday]], NCsoft purposly capped their Beta at level 30 to [[bullshit|"preserve fun"]]. Less than a month into the game, the population realized they were tricked. Levels 1-30 were considered the "good stuff" of the game, and after that there is an amazingly large spike in XP curve and a huge drop off in content, just like what you would encounter in some shitty generic Korean MMO. All those [[fags|hardcore Aion fanboys]] who spammed in every gaming forum because the beta was so awesome pretty much proceeded to [[become an hero]] after this incident.

*'''[[banned|YOU'RE BANNED]]''': <br/>NCsoft pretty much got their [[orgy|thinking caps out together]] and thought of a great plan to pull out their [[banhammer]] and hit their [[balls|player base's weak point]] for [[MASSIVE DAMAGE]]. The hammer came down viciously considering the players had the ability to report people automatically for farming and botting, and NCsoft started banning people for simply talking to a gold seller, or people who unknowingly purchased an item on the AH from someone who bought gold. NCsoft [[seriously]] banned around 10-20% of the people who bought the game in the first few monthes. NCsoft did this all for one reason: For fucking [[jewgold|profit]], and just when they slashed their price on the game, they knew that these [[retard]]ed [[fanboy]]s would come back and buy their game again at half price. [[Win|Fucking touché indeed NCsoft]]

*'''Server Transfers''': <br/>After two months, the game was losing players, as many of the players found that this was not the ultimate [[World of Warcraft|WoW]] killer they were looking for. Not only did about half their players simply stop playing in the first two months, but they REPORTED banning [[over 9000|over 100k more]]. Server numbers plummeted and [[pee|PVP]] dried up. But hey! Those pesky wait times are gone! NCsoft is quoted as announcing that Server Transfers will be available in November 2009. So they kept their word right? What do you fucking think? They're still not in the game yet after seven months, yet they announced that it will cost $25 [[jewgold|Jew dollars]] for a transfer, yet again showing that NCsoft is looking for more [[jewgold|profits]] before they dump this shit game like what happened to ''[[Tabula Rasa]]''.

*'''The Banning Continues''': <br/>After a while, their numbers fell even more, and NCsoft's hammer arm got tired, most likely because NCsoft [[masterbate|masturbated]] too much with that hand or perhaps they finally found out they couldn't make any more [[jewgold]] because the [[retard]]ed [[fanboy]]s got the picture and decided to finally quit, but that didn't stop them from fucking up anymore! So you own a fort with your Legion, and everyday out get your money. Do you take it out and get on with your life? Thats what I thought too! Thats until NCsoft sent everyone [[divide by zero|trillions of Kinah in the mail at random, and banned everyone who took it]]. The great insult wasn't that some bored [[redneck|neckbeared]] did it [[for the lulz]], but that they have a system in place that automatically bans you with no questions asked if you open a mail with too much money in it. Yes. [[troll|You can actually grief people by sending them a lot of money in Aion.]] I guess these [[jackass|Aion developers]] forgot to turn it off because the [[retard]]s actually found out there were doing it for [[jewgold|profits]].

*'''[[Shit Nobody Cares About|Fortress Timers]]''': <br/>[[Shit Nobody Cares About|In a minor hotfix, NCsoft randomly lowered the time you have to capture a fort from 2 hours to 30 minutes. This made taking a fort mathematically impossible on most servers. Also, it desynced the dredgion so the balaur can't take forts back because of this timer. They still haven't fixed this]].

*'''Patch 1.9''':<br/>Forward months ahead, and servers are down to less than 1000 online at peak on [[Friday]]. Korea has had Patch 1.9 for months now, but NCsoft are being [[stupid]] as always and delaying the date to perhaps [[2012]]. The hilarity ensues when NCsoft says it is being delayed [[lie|because of translation time]], and everyone with [[smart|rational thought]] tells them that 1.9 is just a bug fix and class balance patch, so there is literally nothing to translate. Don't worry guys, [[truth|NCsoft has never lied about a date before.]] Let's not get started by the amount of [[butthurt]] [[fags]] that are playing [[anal|Assassin]] at the moment and they are planning to [[protest|boycott]] NCsoft if 1.9 does indeed nerf their skilled based class.

*'''[[Jesus|Public test Server]]''':<br/>In [[Last Thursday]], it was announced that Aion will get a testing realm! [[Holy shit|Holy Shit!]], NCsoft must be pretty desperate for [[jewgold|profits]], so they decided to go along the Blizzard [[World of Warcraft|WoW]] route and make a test server! And in true Aion fashion, every single person on the forum went into a [[shitstorm]] with hype, [[trolls]] found this as an opportunity into getting the [[fanboys]] to waste $15 [[jewgold|Jew Dollars]] to resub the game, and then watch them [[BAW|complain]] afterwards that their test server was nothing more but a meer joke. There were people who had signatures counting down to the test realms opening, and [[lie|they were 100% sincere in their excitement!]] Aion was so depraved of anything at all to do, that [[fail|people were actually resubscribing to play on a realm that their characters will be periodically wiped from.]] [[Yes|Can they seriously fuck up a standard feature in every MMO for the past 10+ years?]]<br/>[http://www.aionsource.com/topic/110239-information-on-refunds-for-those-who-resubscribed/ What] [http://www.aionsource.com/topic/110222-so-they-lied-to-us/ do] [http://www.aionsource.com/topic/110215-not-sure-i-heard-this-right-no-19-on-pts-for-another-2-weeks/ you] [http://www.aionsource.com/topic/110215-not-sure-i-heard-this-right-no-19-on-pts-for-another-2-weeks/ think?] 

*'''Patch 2.0''':<br/>'''SPOILERS''': Patch 2.0 won't be the saving grace of Aion, and everyone will just run off to [[SWTOR|another MMO]] capable of deeming to be called the ultimate [[World of Warcraft|WoW]] killer, but everyone knows that the ultimate [[World of Warcraft|WoW]] killer will just be another fucking clone of [[World of Warcraft|WoW]]. Those that stay in Aion will make [[no life|5 lvl 30 characters]] just to get the greatest [[shit|ganking set]] of armor, and Aion will be nothing more but twinked out characters [[pee|PvPing]] each other... oh wait. Actually, the game is not bad now and better then wow in some ways. And WAYYYYYYYY better then FF14. 

*'''[http://www.massively.com/2010/05/18/aion-1-9-patch-dated-server-merges-announced/ Server Merges Announced]''':<br/> On May 18, 2010, server merges were announced because ''Aion'' is plummeting. [http://www.eq2flames.com/aion-online/63263-game-dead-yet-7.html Fanboys claim that HATERS GONNA HATE], even going as far as saying that if you don't like ''Aion'', you probably [[what|can't afford it]]. However, they're just in [[denial]] that ''Aion'' failed in the [[USA|west]]. Retards.

*'''Patch 1.9 Released!'''<br/> On June 2nd, NCsoft finally released Patch 1.9 in the west. The patch came four whole months after the korean patch, and created massive lulz within the community. When it released, the forums immediatly sprang to life wit complaints. [[fail|The fact that the patch was 4 months late, was enough to incite violence, but the patch lowered quest rewards, making the grind take longer.]] On the other hand, it made gold loot drop far more often in the few dungeons the game has, making you get all the loot from them and causing you to quit that much faster.
**[http://www.aionsource.com/topic/112848-did-they-really-fix-the-grind-thread/ Here] is [http://www.aionsource.com/topic/112538-ncwest-wakeup-supplements-discussion/ some] sample [http://www.aionsource.com/topic/113095-19-didnt-deliver-for-me/ drama.]

*'''Server Merges!'''<br/> Server Merges are coming, and they plan to lower the game to having 5 NA servers, combining 3-4 servers into one server. Surely they can't fuck this up, they've had so many6 shitty MMOs fail in America so they should have tons of experience in this field.<br/>Edit: [http://www.aionsource.com/topic/115288-server-merge-delayed/ Sonova] Bitch. Spoke too soon. Proof positive that NCsoft are simply trolls doing their best to make Americas hate South Korea, meaning NCsoft is actually secretly ran by Kim Jong Il.

==Tits or GTFO==
[[File:NCsoft.png|thumb|right|[[No|Yes]], yes it is.]]
''Aion'' is [[one]] of [[dungeons and dragons|two]] MMORPGs that feature Aurora Technology's Gender Identity System. With this system, [[Men|players]] who want to create a female character must pass a [[tits or GTFO|Webcam Test]]. Aurora Technology believes that restoring a player's real gender can [[bullshit|make female players feel respected]].<br/>It should be noted that lulz would likely ensue if an actual female were to fail said webcam test.

==IP Blocks==
NCSoft, with its abundance of intellect, recently decided to block IP address ranges where a large percentage of users fell under the same IP. Considering that a substantial number of players were connecting via proxies due to NCSoft's server lag, this was an [[obvious]] mistake.
{{clear}}
==Pool's Closed==
[[Image:aion-fail.jpg|frame|center|After 10 minutes of playtime, the server is going to boot you, and you're going to see this screen again.]]

It is suspected that these "server full" messages were caused by hundreds of crazy-ass [[nigras]] who decided to attack a mystical online universe instead of closing pools, although it is [[at least 100]]% true that the servers were, in fact, full due to [[AIDS]].<br/>[[Shit that nobody cares about|Yeah it was fixed]], but who the fuck cares?

'''Copypasta
'''

Why do you guys all run when the first 50 shows up? I noticed this last night and today. Asmos are always out ganking away in Eltnen, especially right by Golden Bough Garrison not too far from the temple. Asmos just griefing it up.

Then one elyos 50 comes out and kills one of you guys, and suddenly you disappear. This happened to me just a couple hours ago. Some sorc was there camping the area with all those crab looking creatures and killing every lowbie that was there. Then suddenly he got dropped in like three hits or so by a 50 assassin that popped out and took him down.

A few minutes later, that same sorc was back again with a few friends. The sin took down the sorc again and the lowbies in the area help as much as we could. We ended up killing the gankers and the sin hung around watching over the area so we could finish questing. No more asmos the rest of the day.

I gotta tell you, if the asmos on this server are that terribad that they flee at the first sight of a level 50 elyos when they don't have enormous numbers on their side, I'm gonna have so much fun when I get to 50 and get some gear.

I'm gonna be a HUGE griefer. I'm beginning to think, just based on what I've seen here so far, that the asmos clearly rely on their numbers and not on skill. Every time I see an elyos 50 vs an asmo 50 1v1, the elyos almost always wins. It's like the old horde vs. the alliance in WoW, where all the alliance had was numbers, but all the skilled PvPers played horde, and it showed whenever the numbers were even.

I get ganked a LOT while questing here regardless of the zone. Eltnen, Heiron, Abyss, doesn't matter. But what it's teaching me is how to survive. And I'm sure other low level elyos are learning the same thing.

No way I'm transferring now.
