Cyberpunk

'''Cyberpunk''' was the unholy spawn caused by a bad bag of mushrooms and a rather lukewarm reaction to ''Lord of the Rings'' slashfiction. The general point of all cyberpunk is that evil [[Microsoft|multinationals]] have taken over the world, and only a handful of hackers and/or AIs that may or may not want to destroy all humanity can save the day. They do this by entering the most embarrassingly bad vision of the [[Internets]] ever.  

Cyberpunk internets are almost complete quasi-physical constructions, which means something as simple as following a link or looking into a new folder means literally walking from one end of a [[Time_Cube|virtual reality]] to another. To upload or download files, they have to make their avatars literally drop or pick up files inside giant cities, when FTPs or web browsers can do the same thing in seconds. TECHNOLOGY!!! 

Similarly, all but the most advanced of AIs are quasi-physical phenomenon, meaning that for no good reason, having one virtual reality person [[cutting|stab]] an AI [[Quitting_IRC_forever|deletes]] them.

To cover up for the fact that a sci-fi book using essentially real-world technology only a few decades more advanced than ours can somehow fail to grasp even the most basic of [[blue_box|computer]] workings, they try to add something [[Scientology|mystical]] or [[religion|religious]]. For example: "[[OMG|zOMG]]!!! The corporation is [[Cthulhu|Babylon]], and the computers are Zion!"

Note: If it's the [[Matrix]], they went with the COMPLETELY different mystical component of "zOMG!!! The computers are Babylon, and the [[people|peoples]] is Jew!!!"

Cyberpunk is not just a genre of books; it is a lifestyle. Just like being [[furry]] or [[gay]] is a lifestyle. The majority of cyberpunk kids grew up in homes wallowing in the [[fat]] of their [[buttertroll]] parents and, unable to fight for themselves, they turned to the [[Internets]] and became [[troll]]s.  

==Spinoffs==
Like all [[retarded]] [[crap]], this genre of already [[w|dubious]] literary value gave birth from its [[Centipede filled vagina|centipede-ridden womb]] to several different flavors of dumb spinoffs:

*'''[[Steampunk]]''' is when you have steam powered mecha like in that Will Smith movie. It's generally very stupid because, during the time frame in question, [[England]] was the [[United States]] and the [[United States]] was all about [[cowboy]]s fighting [[black|Indians]]. The critical consensus in most circles suggests that contemporary steampunk literature is built around the use of steam and hydraulic action as a metaphor for homosexual attraction, what with the pumping, spraying, heat, and high-pitched noises. Steampunk is also interesting for having spawned a particularly special genre of music that would sound passable, if the lyrics weren't so stunningly fucking stupid (see [http://www.abneypark.com/ Abney Park]).

*'''Cthulhupunk''' is the highly improbable genre in which you get nerds on the [[Internets]] worshiping [[H.P. Lovecraft]], and somehow they aren't just being [[fat]] [[loser]]s but, like, ''it's all real''. Tentacle [[rape]] is often involved.

*'''Donkeypunk''' is a [[sex]] maneuver used when you're doing Johnny Rotten or [[Necrophilia|Sid Vicious]] from behind.
