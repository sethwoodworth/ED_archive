Crinklepedia
'''Crinklepedia''' was a website for adult [[Diaperfur|diaper fetishists]] and [[babyfur]]s. [[Anonymous]] raided them in the wee hours of the morning of January 11, 2007, and nothing of value was lost.

==The site== 
Crinklepedia was a crappy wiki site about diaper fetishism.  It was mainly used by pedophiles, furries, and retired astronauts. 
 
==You-know-who doesn't forgive==
Starting at approximately 10:30 PM Eastern, using the shared accounts "TheUnfrogivingAnonymous" and "KramerThinksYourAllNiggers", /i/nfidels and [[eBaum]]ers descended on the site, and quickly realized they were the only people on. Instituting a firm grasp of the wiki, pages and catagories were changed, moved, and otherwise fucked with. Some pages got [[Bel-Air]]'d, others got [[DESU]] floods, still others were replaced with [[yiff|YIFF IN HELL FURFAGS]]. [[Zippocat]], Game Over and various other shock pictures flooded the site, especially after they told the legion to "[[irony|Grow the fuck up]]".

==Oh [[shit]], here comes the Poop Police!==

Eventually, several [[fags|regular users]] logged on and noticed what Anonymous had done, tirelessly reverting or blanking pages anonymous had [[rape|raeped]]. Unfortunately, at that point, the legion outnumbered the official users on the site by a large margin, and any changes back to "official" versions was quickly reverted to Anonymous' far more epic versions. 

<s>Un</s>Fortunately, the site has been baleeted.<br><br>
