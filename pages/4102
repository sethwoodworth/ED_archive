An '''Interrobang''' is a [[lulz|corruption]] of "!?" or "?!". The Interrobang arrived on [[7chan]] [[last Thursday]] when [[anonymous|someone]] posted the [[Wikipedia]] link to this certain puncuation, inspiring much [[shoop|shooping]]. It is probably the most [[lulz|lulzy]] punctuation mark [[evar]], and not a means for arabs to get information out of you.
