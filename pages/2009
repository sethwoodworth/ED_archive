'''DandCVideos''' are a couple of piece of [[shit]], [[racist]] [[vlog]]gers on [[YouTube]] who are best known for their hatred for black person, [[azns]] and [[producing101]]. An inbred [[white trash]] Canadian couple from a backwoods town, their a pair of psychotic, bitter, and obsessed old morons who are notable only for having the [[crap]]piest [[spam]] ridden [[YouTube]] channel.  They are known for having a [[fucktard]]ed internet presence in general due to the fact that they spam their nonsense anywhere and everywhere in the hopes that people will somehow forget how [[fugly]] and disgusting they both look.  They live somewhere in a hidden [[lulz|trailer park]] deep in the forests of Ontario and will most likely die penniless and have spent tens of thousands of hours online trying to attain just a tiny bit of [[e-fame]] to justify their sad pathetic lives.  E-fame that ain't comin' [[Image:DandC toothless retard.JPG|thumb|right|250px|David: toothless dbag]]

==Spam==
DandCVideos, aka David and Charmaine Voisine, will stop at nothing to [[spam]] [[YOU]] with their utter fucking bullshit.  They have been rumored to be [[internet]] sociopaths based on their previous experience in [[stalk]]ing fellow [[YouTube]] users. D and C are also known to be completely obsessed with Elvis and anything with a maple on it. It is suggested that [[One_does_not_simply_X_into_Mordor|one should approach D and C with care]], due to the nature of their massive [[spam]] campaign.  David and Charmaine are masters at the art of [[shameless self promotion]] and take any opportunity whatsoever to try and promote their inane, pointless, bullshit in an attempt to [[The Kewl Kids|make it big on YouTube]].

==Ignorant Racists?==
[[Image:DandCVideos stare.JPG|thumb|right|200px|It's unclear why David is always rolling his eyes like a [[retard|mental deficient]] and staring off into space, [[some argue|some speculate]] that it's an involuntary reflex due to years of huffing [[jenkem]]]]
[[Image:DandC subscribers.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Their subscriber base.]]
The video they made asking [[Thewinekone]] to go back to his "homeland".  [[Not racist]] at all.  DandC are '''obsessed''' with the much more successful Canadian vlogger (and azn) Thewinekone.

==DandC leave [[Vloggerheads]]==
In sept. 08, after initiating some [[batshit]] drama with another vlogger ({{youtube2|Airricksreloaded|Airricksreloaded}}) on [[Vloggerheads]], and after finding out [[no one]] wanted to watch their shitty "vlogs" there either, they [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|closed up shop]]. Looks like even the Vloggerheads hugbox [[Lolcano|doesn't even want them around]].
