'''Insectduel''' is a 23 year old, male ROM-hacking veteran named '''Rondell L. Mol√©''' from the Bronx. Since an early age, he has shown a passion for [[buttsecks]] and still drops the soap to this day. As an experienced artist, Insectduel has proven his skill by making forum signature banners with [[photoshop]] to advertise his critically acclaimed ROM-hacking work. Much of his art is reminiscent of [[animu]] and the "''Winx Club''".

He takes care to keep his name from being tarnished; for example:

{{squote|You can no longer view my MySpace page anymore. The profile will remain in private. However, I've still cannot host a real pic of me in public for safety reasons.|Insectduel}}

He also wishes people to take him and his affairs [[serious business|seriously]]:

{{squote|Our staff, our board, and rules are [[serious business|SERIOUS]]. This is not a joke board.|Insectduel, from part of the headline of his forum}}

In addition to the skills he's learned in [[Computer Science 3]], he's also mastered the use of the English language from his foray into 12th grade English. His proficiency with the Japanese language is also apparent:

==ROM-hacks==

Ever since passing [[Computer Science 3]] in High School, Insectduel has produced work loved by many throughout the community like '''"Afterworld 8"''' and several other [[Faggotry|masterpieces]]. He also has a few projects in development, some of which will allegedly include [[Hacking|"ASM"]], a programming language that he'd learned while in [[Computer Science 3]].

==Fame==

Some critics have said that sometimes he's gone as far as to patronize the [[n00b|less experienced]] ROM-hackers, and even stating that this message may upset the casual browser:

{{squote|Condensed Rules for idiots like you

One. No SPAMMING
Two. No flaming, either. Idiots will be banned on sight.
Three. No acting like a mod unless your name is in a flavor other than 0.
Four. No advertising. (This includes MySpace)
Five. No being stupid.
Six. Don't ask for ROMs. It's posted everywhere. Don't be a stupid moron and ask (you'll get permabanned)
Seven. No, you can't have a copy of Proboards. Stop asking. We are never associated with the Proboards development team.
Eight. Hacking a ROM and showing nothing but screenshots of a single level with nothing new is a good way to get a thread closed.
Nine. No profanity bypassing.
Ten. Gross amounts of stupidity will be banned on sight.

If you obey these rules, you'll do fine. Disobey them and I'll ban you.|Insectduel, from his "Newbie Forum"}}

Others have criticized his work; they've called it poor and Insectduel himself a newbie, citing the irony in that he is allegedly a newbie calling others newbies.

His harshest critics and most beloved followers agree: He is responsible for the contempt in which he is held. His friends say that others are jealous of his skill and creativity, others claim that he is a hack, with a poor attitude and a lack of any tangible work under his belt. Regardless of which side one is on, most acknowledge his fame, which may be [[attention whore|exactly what he intended]].
