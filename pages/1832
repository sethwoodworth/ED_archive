'''Crazy Gideon''' ([[Powerword]]: '''Gideon Kotzer''') is a [[batshit insane]] [[Israel|Israeli]] [[crook|business owner]] residing in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].  He is best known around L.A. and [[YouTube]] for his fucked up collection of [[Advertising|TV commercials]] for his electronics store, Crazy Gideon's, that aired late at night.  Unfortunately, this is why Crazy Gideon's had to close forever at the end of January 2010 because [[normal people]] don't watch TV when his commercials aired.

==The [[A challenger appears|Challenge]]==
Crazy Gideon bought a warehouse in 1991 in downtown L.A. and wanted to get into the consumer electronics business.  The challenge he was faced with was to take all the [[Shit|damaged merchandise]] that name-brand and off-brand warehouses didn't want anymore because they were:

* Discontinued
* Made obsolete
* Fell off the truck and chipped but still worked
* Refurbished

Crazy Gideon had to try and sell it like new so that even [[retards]] would buy this shit, since people would rather piss more money away to popular chains like [[Geek Squad|Best Buy]].  In order to cover up his [[scam]] and stay in business, Crazy Gideon was left with no choice but to let his insanity out in a set of commercials, embedded below.

# Be willing to destroy your own merchandise.
# Hire a [[creepy]] sales floor staff to make people feel uncomfortable as shoppers.

If you search for L.A.'s favorite Israeli on [[Google]], you'll see that they have his website flagged as potentially harmful for your computer.  If you're a casual [[Firefox]] user and try to visit his site, it is listed as a reported attack site.  The power of his craziness is so intense, your [[Spyware|antivirus software]] mistakes it for malware.  Remember, [[ALL CAPS|IF YOU DON'T BUY FROM CRAZY GIDEON, YOU GET MALWARE ON YOUR COMPUTER!]]
