Eric the Midget
{{crap}}
'''Eric the [[Midget]]''' (real name Eric Lynch, aka Eric the Astronaut, and Eric the [[buttsecks|Shitty-Penis]]) is a [[fail]]ed abortion and frequent caller to ''The [[Howard Stern]] Show''.

Though he was born sometime [[last Thursday]], he has outlived every prediction of lifespan by nearly threefold.

===Physiology===
Eric the Shitty-Penis' physiological profile

====Appearance====
Lynch is less than two feet tall, and may or may not have legs. Either way, the little fucker can't walk without the use of cybernetic prostheses. Because these don't FUCKING EXIST, Lynch is relegated to a chair strapped to a banana board.

Per Jimmy Kimmel, Lynch's hands are creepy, srsly: [http://www.marksfriggin.com/news08/2-25.htm#mon "it was like shaking hands with a rotten plum."]

ETM's eyes are reminiscent of [[Happy Negro]] at a watermelon buffet, possibly due to the excessive speed at which he travels...sans legs.
His skin appears blotchy, and covered in blemish, and he dyes his hair an inhuman shade of copper.

Lynch wears glasses, because he is a perennial dork, whether the frames can withstand his mighty eye-bulge is unknown.

====The Power Chair====
Eric the Midget is approximately 21 inches tall when not perched upon his power chair. Though it is unclear whether this chair is an actual source for Lynch's evil powers, he clearly derives mobility from this modern-day siege perilous, which allows him to cover level terrain at [[over 9000]] miles per hour. 

====You Know what they say about Short Guys====
On [http://www.marksfriggin.com/news06/5-15.htm#wed May 17th, 2006] Eric the Midget (ETM) was set to teh task of measuring his hog. He reported it was somewhere between 6 and 8 inches, but later confirmed that he was only five, which by midget standards makes him comparable to Mandingo and various other negroids.

====Reproductive Capability====

ETM is a self-admitted [[virgin]], and has only ever got to first base with his [http://www.kendrassecret.com fake camwhore girlfriend]. On the same date that he measured his wang, the virgin who could kick the bucket at any moment decided it would be prudent to deny a sexual encounter with pr0n actress and noted [[attention whore]] Tabitha Stevens.

He now openly admits to having spastic midget secks with his bedding, and cumming in his "PJ Pants," though not washing after.

Fortunately for his roommate, Eric doesn't do his own laundry which effectively leaves the patsy (named Jon) [[pwn]]ed.

Sometime last Thursday Eric visited the bunny ranch and lost his virginity to a partially decomposed whore named Airforce Amy.[[Image:Etmnoodz.jpgâ€Ž|thumb|250px|right|Eric and Joan Rivers after the greatest 12.7 seconds of his "life"]]

====Speech====
ETM has a tiny body, so TINY FUCKING LUNGS, HELLO?! This inhibits his ability to speak without adding 1-2 extraneous syllables to any given word (e.g. "good morning" becomes "goo-ood mo-r-orning").

As a result of his errant and troubling speech, his vocal stylings are nearly indiscernible from the Martians featured in "Mars Attacks."

====Fucked Up Foot====
On March 2, 2009, Eric the Midget revealed on the [[Howard Stern]] show that he is [[Pwnt|club-footed.]]  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csHGvaPITpQ "I'm club fucking footed you asswipe."]

===Psychological Profile===
Eric the Astronaut lacks any reasonable grasp on reality, causing him to believe a shit ton of nonsense which no rational person would.

====Idol Expert====
Eric is a self-proclaimed expert on ''American Idol''. Not only does he consistently [[fail]] at live [http://jfsc.tv commentary] via stickcam, he also perennially falls in love with a random, and not necessarily attractive contestant (see also [http://dianadegarmo.com Diana Degarmo]. When you fail at being a spectator of an abortion of a pop culture phenomenon, you are the incarnate of fail.

====Diana DeGarmoo====
ETM met her briefly at a meet & greet event, and then got her phone number from Howard Stern.
After repeatedly calling her [[mother]], he failed yet again at coordinating any semblance of a plan to, get this: INTRODUCE HIS PARENTS TO HER'S!

The fail resonated through history itself when DeGarMom called the Howard100 news team to report that he was stalking their daughter.

====Katherine McPhee====
See above, but with an attractive bitch.

====Kendra====
The most recent of Eric's delusions of able-bodiedness: the whore from [http://kendrassecret.com Kendra's Secret dot com]. In a ruse crafted by Johnny Fratto, Kendra was selected to pretend to be ETM's girlfriend. She did it to get publicity, and Eric the Detective didn't think anything too suspicious about a video camera constantly rolling tape while he attempted to catch mono from a pastie-wearing "stripper." 

A double-pwned backfire occurred when Eric got his first lapdance and decided he was going to "play the field."

===Trolling===
Even though ETM has been trolled by God since birth, some people still wanna troll him. Here are some strategies that have worked for others:
* '''The Gub'ment''' Eric the stupid Midget is trolled by [[republicans|congress]] each and every day that the [[USA]] doesn't allow Stem Cell research
* '''[[Howard Stern]]''' who has on numerous occasions tried to get Eric to fly by strapping balloons to teh Chair of Power;
* '''[[Tom Cruise|Scientologists]]''' who believe Eric looks like a body thetan
* '''[http://jfsc.tv Johnny Fratto Social Club]''' where people harass him by asking legitimate, and often mundane questions on his American Idol cam show; he always b&'s them forever (until the next day)
* '''Diana Degarmoo''' by denying him a date and looking like a troll herself.
