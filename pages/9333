For the [[2010 World Cup]] in South Africa, FIFA decided to make a [[Lie|safe, fitting]] mascot. However, they unfortunately decided on an [[anthropomorphic]] leopard and called it '''Zakumi'''. [[Furries]] soon caught on, immediately spreading their [[furry]] [[AIDS]] to [[Africa]].

Zakumi is simply a [[horny]] [[shota|teenage]] leopard. Zakumi spends more time in [[furpile]]s than he does playing [[football]]. Of course, have you ever seen him on the pitch? No, you haven't. Before, during, and after a match he is instead found being a submissive bitch in the stadium's changing rooms.

{{quote|i would totally yiff zakumi if he didnt have aids|A furfag}}
[[Typical]]ly only furfags find Zakumi interesting. Everyone else will just think "aw, what a cute mascot" then ignore it completely.

In the league of [[furfaggotry]], Zakumi is either drawn as a cub or an adult, even though according to FIFA he was born in June 1994 making him a teenager. It doesn't matter to [[furries]], they think [[pedophilia]] is [[awwwright]].

Zakumi is already on [[Facebook]], [[Ychan]] and a bunch of other mainstream sites.
