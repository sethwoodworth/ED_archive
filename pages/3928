A common catchphrase for haughty assholes who think that lies about their feeble intellects impress anyone, "'''I have a 140 IQ'''" (alternatively, "'''I have an IQ of 140'''" or "'''My IQ is 140'''") is a staple of [[flamewar]]s on the [[internets]] involving [[13-year-old boy]]s, [[asspies]] and self-absorbed [[basement-dweller]]s.

==Comeback==
Asking the perpetrator what '''IQ''' actually stands for or where 140 falls on the IQ test bell curve will - more often than not - result in silence until they can [[Google]] it. Also, be sure to tell them that tests on [[Quizilla]] aren't meant to be taken seriously.
