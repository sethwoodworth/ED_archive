Raid Backfire
[[Image:backfire.jpg|thumb|Whoops.]]

A raid backfire usually occurs when some [[retard|idiot]] posts a raid target that is either undeserving or simply a bad target using a username (on any of the [[*chans]] or other [[anonymous]] posting sites) or on a sign-up board with a username he commonly uses across the [[OTI|intertubes]], and after a [[fail|single google search]] the aspiring raidfag has [[dox|all he needs]] to ruin the person's life.

A good example would be the backfire-raid on [[Alex Wuori]].

After a raid backfires it is common for the [[retard|raidee]] to attempt to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|remove all evidence]] of his epic [[fail|failure]], usually resulting in him getting hit again for his attempt to take down ED or his ED page after discovering it. This happens on [[forums]] [[YOU RUINED IT!|all the time]].

The problem facing the [[Retarded|genius]] masses of today is, they believe that whomever they are asking is their [[personal army]] and will usually not take part in the raid at all themselves, which generally causes the bored [[Anonymous|anons]] of today to [[Justice|attack the person calling for the raid instead of the intended victim]] but this is usually only done by aspiring [[moralfag|/i/nsurgents]] who believe they are doing the right thing simply by attacking the person who is calling for [[buttsex|blood]].
