Computer graphics are those pretty things that eat all your megabytes and megahertz for breakfast. They allow us to do everything from see what its like to steal cars and beat up hookers, to draw [[furry art|sexualized anthropomorphic artwork]] with ease.  The most primitive form of computer graphics is ASCII shown here:

Modern graphics can be broken down into main 3 categories: 2-Dimensional, 3-Dimensional, and 4-dimensional, and can be tightened with the [[Computer Science III|appropriate education]] and [[gay|hairstyle]].

=== 2-Dimensional: ===

Is the old and tired crappy graphics that [[emo]] kids love to see by playing E.T on the [[Atari]]. 2-D graphics nowadays are mostly used in at least 78,294,062 shit [[Randy Solem|Mario vs. Sonic flash animations]]. Despite not even being sperm when this stuff was released, [[13 year old boy]]s will love all this "nostalgic" flash on [[Newgrounds]] because it's trendy. The only current use of 2D graphics nowadays are PowerPoint presentations '''Fun Fact:''' The only game to ever be released on the [[apple|Mac computer]] was a 2D game by the name of ''[[BOLO]]''.

=== 3-Dimensional ===

Three dimensional graphics are the new hotness these days that can improve things at the same magnitude as [[Lens flare]]s. In the film industry 3D graphics have given us wonders such as: Jar-Jar Binks, the spinning car in ''Along Came A Spider'', and a [[The Singing Shark|shark]] that eats [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. [[Gamer]]s in the pursuit of a better gaming experience, will spend more than the equivalent of the gross domestic profit of most third world countries on graphic upgrades for their PC's. These upgrades include [[SLI]] setups, water cooling, power supplies, raver lights, coffee maker, and [[FuckU-FuckMe|vaginal ports]]. Unix-based operating systems can be navigated in cyberspace to lock out Velociraptors thanks to 3D graphics. It is a known indisputable fact that more and/or better graphics in videogames = Better gameplay as shown by this scientific graph:

3D's biggest accomplishment is replacing 2D animation; that not only puts the entire population of [[Korea]] out of work, but also enslaving them with ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.

=== 4-Dimensional ===

Only available with purchase of Sony's latest and greatest console: the [[Playstation 3]].  The fourth dimension is being able to hatch crow eggs by tilting the revolutionary sixaxis controller. Pity its still no where as good as a computer.
