In A.D. [[2010]], war was beginning and on February 10th, [[Anonymous]] unleashed  a massive [[DDoS|Blitzkrieg]] on [[Australia]]n government websites in a ''[[awesome|Shock and Awe]]'' commando [[raid]] dubbed [[Operation Titstorm]]. 

This marked the opening salvo of a war that had been brewing since March, [[2009]] when [[Wikileaks]] published an [[Xbox]] hueg [[ACMA/Full List|list of dox]] on websites that [[Rudd|The Final Boss of Australia]] and his sidekick -Communications Minister [[Stephen Conroy]]- had decided were too hot for [[Ausfag]]s to handle without leading to the [[ruin]]ation of the nation and that were to be [[permab&]] from the country's delicate Internets tubes by the biggest set of [[dog curtains]] this side of [[The Great Firewall of China]].

It is important that all Australians, [[12-year-old boys|particularly young children]], are protected from this material.|Conroy,on being a bad parent|December, 2009}}

Anon was not amused and after declaring war on [[Kevin Rudd]] and co and firing [[DDoS|warning shots]] in [http://www.inquisitr.com/36578/anonymous-vs-the-australian-government-play-by-play-live/ September 2009] an all-out assault on Parliament House was called off since Anon had [[Operation Fatfuck|better things to do]]. 

However, in February 2010 [[Stephen Conroy]] couldn't leave it well-enough alone and after announcing that [[The Man]] would also be banning pix of [[azn|small breasted wimmins]], [[Rule 34|cartoon pr0n]] and [[squirting|female ejaculation]] and then mocking Anon on national TV, the ceasefire was done for and Anon picked up Conroy's thrown gauntlet and announced that hostilities would resume and that this time, they weren't fucking around.

And Anon created [[Project Freeweb]] and saw that it was good..

==The Raid==

On 10/02/10 a single [[:File:Titstorm_OriginalPost.png|OC /b/ post calling for action]] from a [[Tripcode|tripfag]] called Pulser made it through the gauntlet of [[newfag]] shitposts, [[sage]] and [[inb4]]  [[404]] all the way to Anon Central who let loose the seething hordes of [[steroidal hackers]] and sparked up the [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE]] to launch the [[LOIC|Low Orbit Ion Cannon]]s for a [[raid]] the likes of which had not been seen since the heyday of [[Chanology]].

A [[Chanology]]-esque YouTube video was posted, with the following message to the Australian Government:

{{quote|Hello, Prime Minister Rudd, Governor-General Bryce, and members of the Australian Parliament. We are [[Anonymous]]. Over the past several months,

Your ban of pornography depicting [[loli|small breasted women]] is not only discrimination against people based on physical characteristics, but also a 
first step down the slippery slope of [[ACMA|internet censorship]]. Your proposed implementation of mandatory ISP filtering is an outrage, and Anonymous 
cannot allow this to happen. If there is any foreseeable threat to our organization, it is internet censorship. Therefore, [[SFB|we take your actions very seriously]].

The main reason why [[Anonymous]] is so up in arms about [[ACMA|the whole escapade by the Australian government is because of Internet censorship]].  Even though Anonymous has the collective IQ of a pack of Dyslexic hippopotami, they're finally right about one thing: the Australian government is trying to censor the internet.  They've banned [[hentai|drawn porn]], squirting, and small breasts in porn.  The first being for seemingly no reason at all (to try to curb child porn), the second because they consider female ejaculate urine (which has been proven to not be), and the last to, again, curb child porn.   Most of these things are usually viewed on the [[Internet]].  To quote them from the official announcement

*''The attacks hit the Australian Parliament House and Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy websites this morning. At 10:58am the websites appeared sluggish, with some not responding, as well as a FatMan.''
*''A statement from the Attorney-General's office said the Australian Parliament House website was unavailable for approximately 50 minutes due to a distributed denial-of-service attack by "individuals belonging to the 'Anonymous' group".''
*''"[[disregard that|It is now back online]]," the statement, received at 11:14am, said. But the websites still appeared sluggish.''
*''"Australian government agencies identified as potential targets by 'Anonymous' were briefed in advance and [[buy a dog|were provided with suggested mitigation strategies]]," the statement said, adding that the Department of Defence Cyber Security Operations Centre continued to "monitor the situation".''

==Original Letter to the Press (February 8th, 2010)==
<strong>Letter From Anonymous</strong>

<pre>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


﻿Greetings Australian Government Officials, Members of Local and International Press, and the General Public. We are Anonymous.

Austrailia - 2/8/2010 - Over the past several years, we have maintained a close watch on the actions of the Australian Government
with particular focus on its stance towards internet censorship.

Australia's laws on internet censorship are already among the most restrictive in the western world. Their government filters
more internet content than any other Parliamentary Democracy. For some elements within the Government, including Telecommunications
Minister Senator Stephen Conroy, this still is not enough. Late in January of 2009 he proposed legislature that would lead to
mandatory ISP filtering for all of Australia. The stated goal is to prevent Australia from viewing "illegal and unwanted content"
on the internet.

Anonymous' concern with this legislature is twofold.

First, the ambiguity of the term "unwanted content" is completely unacceptable. No government should have the right to refuse
its citizens access to information solely because they perceive it to be "unwanted." Indeed, the only possible interpretation
of "unwanted content" is content that the government itself does not want to be seen.

More importantly, Anonymous does not approve of the steps already undertaken by the Australian Government to control what their
populous sees. Claiming to be cracking down on "simulated child pornography," many depictions of women with small breasts in
pornography have been banned. Officials cannot claim that they believe the models in these movies are in fact underage, as the
production the titles that have been affected are heavily regulated to ensure the age of the models. Instead they are relying on
earlier ambiguous wording that allows pornography featuring models that "appear to be" under 18 years of age to be treated in the
same manner as actual child pornography.

The repercussions of this censorship of a natural body type on the psyche of Australian women cannot be understated, but this
is not Anonymous' concern. The Australian Government will learn that one does not mess with our porn. No one messes with our
access to perfectly legal (or illegal) content for any reason.

We are Legion.
We do not Forgive.
We do not Forget

Expect us.</pre>

==Second Press Release Letter (February 12th, 2010)==
<strong>Letter From Anonymous</strong>

<pre>Dear Kevin Rudd, members of the government and media,
     We know you have noticed our recent actions against the mandatory ISP filtering scheme. We know it has been published in
several news outlets across the globe. This is our stand. We will not sit back as the government takes away our freedom to access 
otherwise perfectly legal pornography and other websites which are not illegal by any other law and which do not pose a threat to 
Australia on an economical, moral or security level.

We would like to make it clear that we do not want to be associated with the "terrorist" stigma. We are simply demonstrating a 
protest on the exact medium of which the Australian Government are trying to filter. Why? We, as Anonymous, the collective legion of 
internet users who fight for great justice and lulz, are the ones who will be affected most by this ridiculous law. This is not a 
terrorist movement. This is not a matter of National Security. This is a way of protesting in which we feel we are getting the media 
and public attention needed to further our actions. No one is getting physically hurt. No one is being denied  necessities. Nothing 
is being targeted that would cause harm to a regular citizen of .au.

Yes, our methods are somewhat illegal, but sometimes these actions must be taken to ensure our message is displayed, especially in 
Australia's case.

The statistics in for and against the Mandatory ISP filtering and being displayed in a poor manner. Let anonymous assure you, there 
are more every-day internet users against the filter than there are for it. Anonymous from around the globe as a collective, is not 
just fighting for Australia, but to prevent the global denial of free speech and access to otherwise public material, which is a 
real possibility. These filters aren't the first step against Australia's freedom, and it is nowhere near the last. We must stop it 
before it spreads, before its too late, and Freedom is gone, not just for Australia, no but for the whole world.

Furthermore we are against the criminalization of things that are not, and should not be, by any means illegal. We would also like 
to let it be known that we are not fighting for the legalization of things that have been illegal in the past. Child porn is 
understandably illegal, it is unfortunate that there is the illegal trade industry for this sort of content. Anonymous accepts and 
welcomes the restrictions of this law. However, criminalizing the pornography of small-breasted women (18+) is completely absurd, 
considering there is a huge market and industry for such material. The idea that having taste for a woman with a small figure and 
small breasts can be found as close to pedophilia is both discriminatory and synonymous to insanity. 

We are Anonymous, a collective of the internet. If there is any foreseeable threat to our organization, it is internet censorship. 
Therefore, we take your actions very seriously.

We shall proceed to do everything in our power to annihilate your government's presence on the internet.

TL;DR: THE COUNTRY IS BECOMING A COMMIE DICTATORSHIP AND WE WONT STAND FOR IT

You have nowhere to hide, because we are everywhere.
We are Anonymous.
We are legion.
We do not forgive.
We do not forget.
Expect us.</pre>

==Casualties==

An Australian Anon known as bush has been fined 550 ausfag gold and had his computers and CP have been seized by the [[AFP]] for inciting others to DoS in the Titstorm. [http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/internet-filter-protest-computer-terrorism/1976743.aspx]

Another Anon known by the name Rand has also been charged and had his computers seized by the [[V&| Australian Faggot Patrol]] and is still yet to be convicted. The [[AFP]] has given him full credit for being the mastermind of the so called [[terrorist]] attack.
