'''Raw foodism''' is a <s>concentration camp diet</s> [[Alternative_medicine|altie diet]] and [[cult]]. Like [[religion|all cults]], followers are required to accept particular [[batshit insane]] dogmas as [[truth|the truth]] or they receive the [[banned|banhammer]] for being brainwashed by the [[Jews]]/[[government]]/corporations/establishment/etc.

Raw foodism's doctrine states that [[Lol_wut|"cooked food is poison,"]] and is to be referred to as "[[abortion|dead food]]." They believe the process of cooking food magically "[[Retarded|saps the body's energy]]."  The doctrine also incorporates the [[vegan]] religious pipe dream that raw food is the [[meat|natural diet of human beings]] -- that humans are fruigivores, like [[poverty|poor people]] and birds.

[[Fundies|Adherents]] to the vegan raw food diet formally refer to themselves as raw food healthfag dilettantes. Of all it's [[Telemarketing|notable endorsers]] none are more notable than [[Kevin Trudeau]].

==Symptoms and signs==
A person involved in raw food faggotry exhibits several distinguishable beliefs and behaviors. These include but are not limited to the belief that [[jews_did_wtc|the Jews did 9/11]], Germ Theory [[denial]], [[hardon]] for [[Oprah]], [[elitism]] and [[moralfag|moralfagginess]], and excessive usage of the words: ''organic''; ''natural''; ''[[Ikea]]''; ''dead food''; ''standard American diet''; ''standard western diet''; ''home remedies'', and ''healthy''.

Most raw food healthfags have an [[Eating_disorder|obsession]] with raw fruits and vegetables; they worship them, pray to them, and [http://www.yuvutu.com/modules.php?name=Video&op=view&video_id=403890 use them for sexual gratification], especially [http://www.yuvutu.com/modules.php?name=Video&op=view&video_id=367788 zucchinis], [http://www.yuvutu.com/modules.php?name=Video&op=view&video_id=382480 cucumbers], and [http://www.yuvutu.com/modules.php?name=Video&op=view&video_id=379021 corn cobs]. By eating the raw foods "[[slut|Mother Nature]]" has provided them with valuable mana points or "life force." Moreover, they believe if the infidels do not accept the holy trinity of raw fruits, vegetables, and [[sperm|nuts]] the punishment will be death by [[old|old age]], [[AIDS]], [[cancer]], osteoporosis, Alzheimer's, heart disease, [[diabetes]], [[depression]], and delusional parasitosis to name a few. However, they maintain it's never too late to turn one's life around by a "lifestyle change" through the raw organic power of the raw foodism doctrine.

The raw food healthfag will often believe to possess the super-human ability to rely solely on their senses for detecting raw food contaminated with bacteria. Unfortunately [[IRL]] for the healthfags, the human senses cannot detect certain [[Funnelgirl|dangerous bacteria]] that have contaminated raw foods, such as ''Listeria Monocytogenes''. Fortunately for the rest of us, willful food poisoning from negligence generates lulz.

{{quote|Germs! It's interesting people would fall for such a thing [...] [[Trap|you would never ever ever eat a tomato that was bad if it was raw. You can sense it. You can touch it and it feels wrong. You smell it and it smells bad... even if it gets passed all that, you put it in your mouth and spit it out and go, aw that's bad...  So you don't need to have that same concern about germs]], that you would when you're cooking food.|Doug Graham, [[Alternative_medicine#Chiropractic|wannabe doctor]] and raw foodism guru}}

Raw food healthfags are required to eat [[over 9000]] lbs of supplements per day because of a lack of Vitamin D, protein, and other deficiencies. Aside from the risk of food poisoning, rickets, dental erosion, malnutrition, and the inability to menstruate in a third of females; raw food healthfags are completely healthy despite their lulzy unnatural [[an hero]] diet.

{{quote|People eat some steamed potatoes and things on raw|The typical intelligence of a raw food healthfag who doesn't understand something cannot be both steamed (cooked from its natural state) and raw at the same time.}}

===Enzyme myth===

Most raw food healthfags embrace the idea that there are enzymes in plants that help our own digestion and they are inactivated by cooking. What they fail to understand is that enzymes get inactivated anyway in the stomach, and are useful only for the plants, not for those who eat them. Humans produce their own digestive enzymes always.

==="Life force"===

When real evidence is slim to none people use their imagination to support their fairy tales, otherwise known as [[goatse|pulling shit out of their ass]]. Raw food healthfags are no different. They borrow from <s>old age</s> [[hippies|new age]] beliefs, and claim raw food contains mystical "[[rape|life force]]" or even "oxygen." 

==="Better" nutritional value===

Raw food healthfags claim a [[YOU_ARE_DOING_IT_WRONG|strict raw food is more nutritious]], but a close [http://www.nutritiondata.com inspection] tells us that they are [[Lol|wrong again]]. Raw/cooked [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|cabbage, spinach, eggs, soy beans, and peanuts]] contain essentially the same thing while boiled [[semen]] (the staple of the raw food diet) triples its Vitamin K content. Besides, cooked food is easier to eat (raw cabbage?), tastes better, and [[scientist|scientists]] say it aids in digestion. Also, some foods are not edible raw, like legumes (toxic) and grains (tastes like [[shit]])

==Evidence of efficacy==
Raw food healthfags maintain that [[none|the scientific studies show]] their doctrine is the [[truth]]. However, when the cult of raw foodism is confronted with legitimate evidence that contradicts their dogma, they will resort to [[self-troll|self-trolling]] by attacking science -- every time bitches, like clockwork -- thinking it is actually a positive argument for a diet based only on raw fruits, vegetables, and semen. As with all ideologues, any contradictory evidence to their beliefs will be interpreted as an invalid conspiracy cover-up or spin.

==LFRV (Low-life & Fat Raw Vegans)==
Among the raw food healthfags there is a [[superman|superclass]] known to [[you|others]] as LFRV. Among their doctrine, donkeys are holy animals, the earth is actually [[dick|banana]] shaped and [[Jimmy Wales]] is an honest individual. According to them, the ideal ratio of mouth, vagina and ear sex is 80:10:10. Also, no more than 10% of daily [[virgin|intercourse]] should come from an animal. [[aliens|They]] eat 3000 [[cock|bananas]] a day and [[oral sex|ingest]] no more than 2 milligrams of avocado for 25 years. They are [[obese]] individuals and should be avoided at all costs, with some minor [[furry|exceptions]].    

=== Good evidence for the efficacy of a raw food diet===
...

===Bad evidence for the efficacy of a raw food diet===
* [[spam|Word of mouth]]
* Since raw food healthfags are obsessed with their new "lifestyle change" which incorporates exercising and being an outdoorfag; they conflate not being a [[obesity|fat]] [[World of Warcraft|sedentary slob]], with the efficacy of their raw food diet. It is [[common knowledge]] that they [[fail|misattribute]] any new found benefits to their idiotic diet while the benefits they are seeing or feeling are actually from a [[Alternative_medicine#Placebo|placebo]] and/or the exercise and [[Solaris|sunlight]] they are getting compared to their previous [[basement dweller|inactive lifestyle]].

==Raw food industry==

For this "natural" lifestyle you have to buy a dehydrator, a food processor, a juicer, raw food books, expensive tropical fruit, supplements and moar. The [[fail|alternative health]] business is a billion dollar industry, but unlike other unregulated markets ripe for the picking of gullible and ignorant consumers, the raw food and alternative health industry consists only of honest mom and pop ventures or maverick "experts" that wouldn't sell the public snakeoil.

Notable raw food extremist gurus:

* David WOLFe
* [[your mom]]
* Tom Billings
* <s>Doctor</s> [[Alternative_medicine#Chiropractic|Chiropractor]] Doug Graham
* [http://www.ecologos.org Lawrence "Larry" "Laurie" "[[Lulzy]]" Forti]

"Larry" "Laurie" "Lulzy" Forti is the current [[black|negro]] king of the raw food movement with queen, Tom Billings. Tom Billings founded the raw food movement when he found out that drinking your own urine is indeed raw and so he decided to also add fruits, vegetables, [[balls|nuts]], seeds and various [[animal]] products like cow dung, sperm and 100% natural, organic, pasture fed, free range, young, non-GMO, unhomogenized, wild, fresh,[[vegetarian]] horse dicks to his diet. Tom is also an extremist, crank, fanatic, zealot, bigot and a [[rape|widely appreciated]] [[gay|drag-queen]].
