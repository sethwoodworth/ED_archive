'''Pounced.org''' is a personal ad site for [[furries]]. More often than not, its users do not put up real pictures, but instead a picture of their crappily-drawn [[fursona]]. When a real picture ''is'' posted, however, one can assume that said furry will be a fat fucking male [[cracker]], or female [[bulldyke]].

Unlike most other personals sites on the Internet, there are several interesting phenomena surrounding Pounced.org in particular. One such phenomena is that [[only 2 percent|a small portion]] of the users are [[straight]] [[women]], implying that the website is one gigantic sausage fest. One would think that the few females using this site would have to deal with hundreds of messages from porn-crazed weirdos, but this assumption is clearly wrong, seeing as how all of the guys on this site are flaming [[homosexuals]]. Another point of interest is that from time to time, one will cross paths with the elusive [http://pounced.org/personals/viewad.php?&hpad=9086 Black Furry]. This is indeed a conundrum, seeing as how the common furry stereotype is [[fat|out of shape]], [[ugly]] [[white|honkies]].

==Underage B&==

Pounced.org has recently decided that the site is full of too many fucking [[pedophilia|pedophiles]]. However, rather than remove the loli-addicts from the site, they took the easy way out instead and [http://www.pounced.org/wiki/wiki.php?htitle=TosChangeNoMinors&hshowcomments=1 gave all users under 18 the boot]. This caused a general uprising from [[Basement-dweller]]s who rely on the internet for [[sex]].

|That's just horrible. You're depriving a lot of people from the opportunity to make good friends and find happiness. I love this site. I found the love of my life on Pounced.|[[An hero|Vernon]]
|Though it may seem horrible that pounced is not letting minors on the site anymore, its not all bad. I personally would like to know that the person whom I am talking to or rp-ing with is over 18. There are lots of human laws out there that could get us in trouble if we started to make any type of "advance" on a minor. I don't know about other furs, but I sure as heck am not going to human jail for being a "sexual predator." No way! This foxxie would never survive in jail. (whimpers)|[[Mary-Sue|Xalelydo]]

==Typical Ads==
[[Image:Pounced_scrnshot_.jpg|thumb|Fake age, gender, and pix.]]
Many people use Pounced.org for the sole purpose of finding [[random]] people to have hot [[MSN|AIM]] [[Unicorn Orgy|roleplays]] with. Users also give out their email addresses, and will sometimes include their [[dox|home phone numbers]] — needless to say, calling said numbers can result in massive amounts of [[lulz]]. Since furries are [[Aspergers|socially retarded]], many fail to realize that Pounced.org is supposed to be a dating service and not a [[LiveJournal]] substitute, oftentimes giving too much information about themselves.

{{squote|Gay, Bipedal black and hyper yiffy werewolf looks for online intercourse only. I just want to be contacted by VERY YIFFY top gay male furs who strictly want online sex and specially those who love to mount wolves over and over, several times a day. I highly prefer lions (!!!!!), foxes (!!!), other wolves (!!!), coyotes, and tigers. Other species are welcome as long as they're not avians and scallies. Just Furry critters and Ah!

{{squote|1=My fursona is a Lynx/Fox because I happened to have cyber sex with a 21 year old furry and I fell in love with him for a while...I am against circumcision totally. It is a horrible practice that robbed me of my completeness. My outer foreskin, ridged band, and all nerve endings that were apart of them were removed, all of them irreplaceable. I am trying to stop in the future from this happening to anyone else. In the future, probably in 10 to 20 years at most, stem cell research will be at the least partially complete and we can clone at least things that we have lost, like arms and legs. And for those of us who miss our completeness that was taken from us at birth, our foreskin.|2=[http://pounced.org/personals/viewad.php?&hpad=6724 what]}}
