Sonic X Bloopers
[[Image:Sonic_X_Bloopers.GIF|thumb|Don't watch them, they're awful]]
===What They are===
They're a [[bad]] branch-off of [[Speakonia]] based videos that dragged on for [[over 9000]] episodes because it took them that long to realized that they sucked.
===How they Started===
[[FireGoron]] made a video called [http://youtube.com/watch?v=qMPbpcnBr10 Sonic X Blooper: Chris Thorndyke] which did not get any views, but it inspired the creation of [http://youtube.com/watch?v=aqK8ABq2LGA a second one] which has [[over 9000]] views because something singing about how black person they are, is SOOOO funny. The series finally gained '''super popularity''' when ZenkaiKenny0 made a third episode, which quickly climbed to the most viewed of the three (duh). When DBZsonic made the 4th, the four of them became known as the Original Sonic X Bloopers team. O lawd T_T<br>Just when FireGoron promised that blooper 19 would be the last of them, he went on and made blooper 20, the '''worst''' yet most favored by the team.

People even made "fan bloopers"

===End of the Sonic X Bloopers===
Awww boohoo. Apparently [[FireGoron]] and ZenkaiKenny0 were in an argument, and everyone took Kenny's side due to his popularity. DBZsonic happened to be one of those people, and he fought back by deleting all of his Sonic X Bloopers. This caused FireGoron to close his account and tell everyone that '''he was leaving youtube'''. He then posted a message on DBZsonic's account that he hacked into that told everyone how he was gang [[rape|raped]] by all of his friends.
