Wtfuazrp
[[Catchphrase]] born from the [[livejournal]] cesspool known as [[debate]].


== History ==
WTFUAZRP ('''W'''ay '''T'''o '''F'''uck '''U'''p '''A''' '''Z'''ero '''R'''eply '''P'''ost) was born from the acronym ZRP ('''Z'''ero '''R'''eply '''P'''ost), a term which [[nerd|debate regulars]] used to describe a post that had no responses.  This was understandably something of an event in a community consisting of around 1,500 members, half of which are generally bored [[troll|trolls]], and it usually occurred for the following reasons:
*The post was so incredibly well-written, well-researched, and comprehensive that nobody could find anything to bitch about.  See also [[TL;DR]]
*The post was so obnoxiously stupid that the trolls were stunned into not knowing which part of it to mock first.

Debate never came to a consensus on how long a post had to actually be in existence before it officially became a ZRP, though for a time it was agreed that it should be once the post was pushed off the main-page.

This lack of consensus led to the generation of WTFUAZRP - this term is used to address the first person who responds to a post that would have been a zero-reply post if only they'd kept their fucking mouths shut.  

Nobody knows, to this day, quite why anybody cared about ZRPs in the first place since once one was discovered, no matter how old, it was immediately fucked-up on purpose or ruined by [http://www.livejournal.com/community/debate/1509045.html gay love.]

== Contemporary Usage ==
Today a WTFUAZRP is used as nothing more than a blank statement that the post sucks and that the commenter -- although replying to it -- doesn't think enough of it to comment on it.
