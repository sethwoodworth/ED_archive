Talk Page Editors
[[File:Dorian_Thorn_Convo.PNG|thumb|500px|Typical talk page discussion.]]

'''Talk page editors''', [[not|affectionately]] known as ''Dramacunts'' (not to be confused with ''[[Dramacrats]]'') are self-confessed [[EDiots]] attemptting to [[troll shielding|blend in]] by bullying [[retards|new users]] while being sycophantic to [[sysops|anyone they think will give them power]]. They spend much of their time frequently complaining about certain articles on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], often without actually fixing or adding anything [[funny]] to the article in question. They are however much more than just whiny little bastards or [[vandals]] - though at first they appear to be the very lifeblood of [[trolling]] and [[drama]] they are known to be [[The GRIDS that is killing ED|a particularly horrible disease known to bring down wikis]]. Many EDiots are only revealed to be Dramacunts when provoked and should be [[eugenics|prevented from spreading]] as soon as they have been identified..

==Symptoms==
1. <b>Projection of Butthurt</b>

Dramacunts always claim certain articles are written by people who are the opposite of the article subject. For example - the article on [[white people]] must have been written by some uppity nigger or the article on [[men]] was written by [[BitingBeaver|a psychotic bitch]]. While this point is <s>occasionally</s> invariably true, this does not stop the fact that the article on [[blacks]] was written by a [[failed]] [[wigger]] or the article about women was written by a chauvinist pig and they are still hilarious.

2. <b>Insertion of inappropriate jokes</b>

Not [[lulz|inappropriate in the good way]] - inappropriate in that they simply don't belong there. Jokes about dumb Americunts belong in the article about [[Americunts]], not [[Britfags]]. Jokes about Christians belong in the article about [[Christians]], not [[atheists]]. 

:*[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Canadia&diff=1998335261&oldid=1998335246 Making fun of Canadians isn't satire but  making fun of Americunts is.]
:*[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=White_People&diff=1998297980&oldid=1998297428 It's true niggers are dumb and lazy, but not white people. That's racist.].

3. <b>No matter how the article is written or how many times it is re-written, they continue to complain that it is not offensive.</b>

If this were so then they would not complain - loudly and persistently - about said article.

4. <b>A misunderstanding of [[Bunker's Law]].</b>

===Making Talk Page Edits To Fluff Your [[e-peen]]===
'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Sometimes new users are really [[sysop|sockpuppet]]s with [[banhammer|surprises]]. Walk with caution:

#Join [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Special:Recent_Changes RC Patrol]   
#Wait for a [[n00b]] user to make an edit, or a [[bad Article|new article]].
#Blast their user page with <nowiki>{{yourgay}}</nowiki> (the creator never read [[Your]], apparently).
#Call them a [[faggot]] on their [[talk page]], because originality is so [[old meme|pass√©]]. 
#Run back to [[IRC|#ED]] and [[USI|point out your latest fake edits]].

===Cause (a.k.a. "The Isaac Hayes Effect")===
All Dramacunts have a serious and sadly incurably mental illness known as '''The Isaac Hayes Effect'''. The condition itself is named after [[dead]] black person Isaac Hayes who played the voice of Chef from [[South Park]], a show popular for it's crude and [[offensive]] humour. [[b/|Nothing was sacred]] and they frequently enjoyed pissing off [[Christians]], [[Jews]], [[Gays]], [[women]] and [[fatties]]. He abandoned the show when they started shitting on [[scientology]] - which just so happened to be his religion. [[Hypocrite|It's different when they make fun of YOUR beliefs]].

The same goes for Dramacunts. Certain articles cause massive amounts of retarded editing wars, namely:

*[[Men]]
*[[Atheists]]
*[[White People]]
*[[Talk:Anarchy|Anarchy]]

Why? <i>Because the majority of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] users are white, atheist males.</i>

Put simply the Isaac Hayes Effect is a sub-division of [[Liberal Butthurt Syndrome]], except that instead of being bleeding-heart flower-children they are bitter, bloated Nazi-wannabes. They have feelings too you know. Interestingly one of the few articles which has (mostly) escaped this onslaught is the page on [[Heterosexuals]] - thus confirming the fact that Dramacunts are [[faggots]].

Due to a terminal lack of imagination, a few smug pricks refer to the Isaac Hayes Effect as Conservative Butthurt Syndrome.

===Misdiagnosis===
Not everybody who complains about an article's shittiness is a Dramacunt. Sometimes the article is just [[shit]]. Similarly just because an article is subject to <nowiki>{{Retarded Editing Wars}}</nowiki>, such as [[Asperger's Syndrome]] or [[Snapesnogger]], this does not mean the people involved are Dramacunts. They are just [[cunts]].

==Case Studies==
{{main|Disgraced Encyclopedia Dramaticians}}

*<big>[[PirateSmackK]]</big> - After a brief vandalism spree on [[TOW]] gave him his 15 seconds of fame, PirateSmackK brought his talent over to [[ED]], but over the years has become an even-malignant cancer on the wiki, leading to him getting his very own article. Though thrilled over his new e-fame, today Pirate tries to keep his [[bullshit]] to a minimum and limits himself to only twelve active [[sockpuppet|sock]] accounts at a time, lest the sysops publicly release his [[dox]]. Oh yes, we do have them.

*<big>[[VandalFucker]]</big> - An ex-[[sysop]] whose finger became stuck on the deletion button. After flinging a good deal of shit about, his own talk page mysteriously went missing as well. This lead to him being unceremoniously de-opped and thrown off the wiki. [[The Missing Talk Page Of VandalFucker|He now has an article to call his own]].

*<big>[[Pokchu]]</big> - An ex-sysop who didn't hit the delete button fast enough. When his parents were sued because of [[Robert Pierson|an article he wrote]], he promptly denounced [[EDiot|his profession]]. Sadly Pokchu's article is no more, but the effect it had on his family will hopefully last forever.

==Conclusion==
[[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]'s popularity stems from its willingness to shamelessly mock everyone and everything - even it's own fanbase. Dramacunts fail to realise this and frequently confuse [[ED]] with [[Metapedia]]. Noticeably however even [[ED]] itself suffers from the Isaac Hayes Effect too - [[irony|the only thing they take seriously is their right not to take anything else seriously]].
