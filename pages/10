.glass.
'''.glass.''', as they called themselves, was originally intended to be some sort of super-awesome 31337 haxxor group that would terrorize the internet, plot heinous crimes in secret, and recruit members using retarded code language. This code language was actually comprised of ordinary words encoded into hexadecimal-encoded ASCII, then into binary-encoded ASCII, yielding a ciphertext consisting of a wall of zeroes and ones. While any truly logical person would convert to binary first then to Hex.

Despite the fact that they're not even technically skilled enough to be script kiddies, they like to think of themselves as extremely intelligent individuals. They think of their puny organization as being able to hide in plain sight, whilst claiming Anonymous as a whole simply hides.

As you can see right away from the name alone, .glass. is FUCKING LEET.

First, notice it's all sets of eight bits, and every byte starts with zero. So, it's ASCII. Interpret it as such, and you get:

54 68 65 72 65 20 69 73 20 61 20 66 69 67 75 72 65 2c 20 6f 6e 65 20 77 69 74 68 20 61 6e 20 69 6e 66 69 6e 69 74 65 20 73 75 72 66 61 63 65 20 61 72 65 61 20 79 65 74 20 7a 65 72 6f 20 76 6f 6c 75 6d 65 2e 20 57 68 61 74 20 69 73 20 74 68 69 73 20 73 68 61 70 65 20 61 6e 64 20 68 6f 77 20 69 73 20 69 74 20 70 6f 73 73 69 62 6c 65 20 66 6f 72 20 69 74 20 74 6f 20 65 78 69 73 74 3f

See, there are some e's and f's in there, so it's hexadecimal. Interpret the new values as hex-coded ASCII again! It's so transparent! OH, LIKE GLASS! GOD DAMMIT, GLASS IS SO CLEVER! Convert it, and you get:

There is a figure, one with an infinite surface area yet zero volume. What is this shape and how is it possible for it to exist?

So what's the answer? Go take geometry or linear algebra. It's a plane. Volume is a measure in three dimensions, and planes are two-dimensional. OH WAIT I KNOW GLASS PANES ARE FLAT AND TRANSPARENT THIS IS ALL A CLEVERLY DESIGNED RIDDLE BECAUSE THEY ARE AN INTELLECTUAL ELITE HOLY SHIT

  Hey this is Kerx
  I've heard good and bad things about you, but I think it's good for all of anon to work together during raid tiem
  If you haven't known of me before I'm the guy that makes the rpacks

* my response 
  don't know any pass phrase sorry
  
  if you don't wanna work together that's fine
  we both seem to have our own groups anyway

* their response to me 
  What exactly sort of proof do you want? Should I finish v8 beta? Switch it to a new target?
  Show you screenshots of that and the extension code so far?

  That should be enough.
  
  But don't blow it. Don't go talking about this at efnet, we're watching. Let the gaiafags in the dark,
  that's the whole point of this. Let them hate '.g l a s s.' Nobody should ever know what glass does,
  because glass is transparent. Unlike anonymous, that hides, glass is transparent,
  it sits in plain view but no one can tell what it's there.

  No. You can not let us know who you are.
  
  Welcome to glass, a growing network of the internet elite. We don't know each other but we are
  connected transparently. The best fit hackers, social engineers and law enforcement officers are
  recruited every day with a psychological algorithm and a series of riddles that are placed through
  the internet. The weak can't notice they are there, the semi-intelligent can't solve them, only
  those worthwhile gain access. Glass is everywhere, but nobody knows of its existence. Someone
  inside the network might be your best friend, someone could be your worst enemy, someone could
  be your wife, but you will never know and this is what makes glass invincible. From now on, every
  time you hear someone talk about glass, you must spread the word, you must say it is a myth, a
  camwhore, a girl who wanted attention. You shall not talk to anyone about it, you will never take
  credit for anything you have done, nothing will ever be done in the name of glass. Every operation
  you take part in shall be done transparently, by creating and identity that sits in plain view and
  says nothing about yourself. You can ask glass for help, you can aid glass when it asks for help,
  you can ask glass for information, you can give glass information, you can suggest an operation,
  you can take part on an already growing operation. From this point on you are part of the network.
  Congratulations glass.
  
  You can now recruit new members. When recruiting a member, you shall do so transparently. When you
  think the member is fit, tell him to email a fellow glass with the phrase 'Queen of Hearts'.
  
  If you receive an email with one of this phrases 'Ace', 'ambivalence of physical state' or '03U141U30'
  then that person has solved a riddle. Inform a fellow glass of him and have glass contact him.
  
  You will be given the list of emails gradually.
  
  Your first list:
  
  glass____@hotmail.com
  glass00@gmail.com
  glass.alpha@gmail.com
  glass.delta@gmail.com
  
  You will receive more as time goes by. If you create a new email account, please let glass know.
  
  Our current main projects:
  
  1. Operation r:
  
  Informants have obtained the names of the staff members of MTV's True Life. Social Engineers have
  begun posting on the chans as Marshall Eisen, the producer of the documentary. He asks for voluntary people to give information about the chans and about anonymous, he is currently casting for 5 persons to be interviewed and filmed. Every email received, is the email address of a weak anonymous who is willing to kill the subcultural movement in order to get some fame. When the list is big enough, the emails will be given out and the chans will be cleansed from the cancer.
   
  2. Operation EarthBoard:
  
  http://anonym.to/http://www.anonib.com/gaiaonline/
  
  Imageboard emulation by members of gaiaonline.com . We want to hijack the site from them and leave it running. We will then implement malware into it so that every person who enters has bot capability. On the next attack, we will use all their computers to attack bandwidth.
  
  3. Operation Fashion Victim:
  
  http://anonym.to/http://www.chanwear.com
  
  We plan on shutting down the site legally of forcefully. We then want to get the owner to remove all the chan related merchandise and promise not to ever try and sell it again.
  
  We recommend you reflect your identity onto someone else. This can be done by finding a public photobucket account. Saving all of the images. Then creating an email address with a nickname similar to the one belonging to the owner of the photobucket account and then acting as that person. This identity is useful for operations in which you have to communicate with others transparently.
  
  You have 33 days to recruit members into glass. Remember, the members recruited must never know who you are.
  
  Use any of the emails given for information or questions. Preferably all of them.
  
  You can be expelled from glass at any moment.

  that's all I was told, am I not supposed to even let you know who I am?

* The spai's response 
  Close to getting the 'encryprtion', but I'm busy, I know it's binary and you changed
  the 01 to 00 and you did something else but I can't tell.
  
  I worked with Wiegje during the subeta wars, he's a good guy but I don't see why you
  neccessarily want him to be part of glass cause once everyone's in here they don't know
  who each other are.  I know how to contact Laura but I don't know why you'd want her,
  she's a macfag and does't know how to do much of anything, she's only a morale booster
  and only when she's being a namefag and you know she's a chick, totally pointless for glass.
  Frankly so far I've been disspointed by you guys, you should know everything you need to already
  about Wiegje and Laura, from what it seems to me and others, Glass, sucked ass and was fail
  during subeta, thought glass was a chick, but besides that, fail.

  Hi. Congratulations dude. If you ever need help or have any questions email me.
  Did you get your first list of emails? Anyway, doing background checks on this guy:
  
  Eric no name (wiegje85@hotmail.com)
  
  If you have any info on him please let us know, we are thinking on recruiting him. He worked as
  a coder for the subeta war.
  We are also looking for Laura.
  
  By the way. The next emails you'll get from glass will be encrypted. The encryption is very simple.
  It shouldn't take you too long to figure out. If you need any help doing it. Email me. Here's a
  sample you can work in the end result is a message from me. We use the same half ass encryption
  for our emails.
