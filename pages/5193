'''Mark Levin'''Jew is a [[homosexual]] [[neoconservative]] American radio host and the former [[homosexual|life partner]] of [[Ronald Reagan]].  During the 1980's Levin [[whore|worked]] for President [[Ronald Reagan]] perfoming [[sex|such tasks]] as [[fellatio]], [[69]], and the occasional [[Cleveland Steamer]].  After his lover went [[insane|batshit crazy]] and starting [[tubgirl|pooping himself]], Levin began an unlistenable talk radio show as well as a sexual relationship with fellow [[conservative]] [[douchebag]] [[Sean Hannity]].  Levin is also famous for his [[bestiality|great love]] of [[dogs]], although [[marry Your Pet|not in the traditional way]].  He and actress Fran Drescher are currently locked in a [[flame Wars|heated battle]] for the title of "Most Annoying Voice in the History of Mankind."  

== Shitty Books ==
Levin has [[crap|written]] [[shit|three books]] to date.  One is about Supreme Court members not being [[fascist]] enough.  The second is more lulz worthy, as it is a book [[basement dweller|devoted to drooling over his two dead dogs]].

''Sprite was so beautiful. He had big brown eyes and the softest fur I'd ever touched.  But neither of these features compared to his beautiful rosey red penis.  Sometimes after I'd returned from the studio after a long day of sucking off Sean and Rush, I'd find myself stroking it for hours.''

The third book is about [[delicious Cake|the destruction of America's asshole with the habanero sauce that is satanic liberalism]].  Levin pimps his books every five minutes on his "radio show," and also gets [[sock puppet|screened callers]] to call in to [[fellatio|praise]] the [[Bible|holy book]].  Levin responds by purring like [[Mark Foley|the Conservative pervert in a room full of young male interns]].  Every once in awhile a caller gets through who makes a good point against him, but don't worry Levin knows how to deal with this.  He simply turns down their volume and shouts like a 12 year old [[fag]] until they hang up.  Then he calls them a [[liberal]] bitch and everybody wins, [[amirite]]?  

All of Levin's [[shit|books]] are famous for having very few pages and very large print, so as to assure that his painfully [[retarded]] fans can understand the context.  It is rumored that he will soon be authoring a children's book, but his publisher has expressed concern that his [[Republican|adult fans]] won't realize that it wasn't written for them.

== Gay Relationship ==
In August of 2004, Levin met [[conservative]] talk radio host [[Sean Hannity]].  Sharing a fondness for ignorance and hatred of [[niggers]], Levin and Hannity quickly fell into raging gay anal sex.  On occasion Levin appears on Hannity's television and radio show, flirting hard before driving hours to fellate him.  Levin enjoys speaking softly to his listeners about this when he shyly coos "Sean's always trying to get me on his show..."  Contrary to popular belief, Hannity's nickname for Levin ("The Great One") comes not from his admiration for his broadcasting skills, but from his admiration for Levin's [[rimjob]] skills.  

== The Homosexual Bunker ==
Levin's radio show and podcast reference a [[Coast to Coast AM|bunker from an undisclosed location]].  This is [[Pool's Closed|due to]] President Obama's blackness, fear of minorities, and [[AIDS]].  Levin got the idea after witnessing Dick Cheney's superhuman paranoia during the Bush administration.  The bunker is in fact a fortress of [[fag]]gotry.  Eyewitness male prostitutes report of bizarre sexual acts including Eagles, slices of apple pie and sodomization with the American flag.

== Nicknames ==
Levin uses a number of unclever nicknames to describe anyone he wants to troll.  These include: [[liberal media|MSLSD]], [[cloaking|New York Slimes]], [[Keith Olbermann|Keith Overbite]], [[liberal|statists]], and [[communist|marxist]] to name a few.  Thanks to this practice, it is painfully easy to spot a Levin listener on the internet, as they can only mimic the "satire" of their Jewish FÃ¼hrer.  If the name in question can resemble anything negative, Levin uses it repeatedly to the delight of his rich white listeners.  Imagine a [[the child in Africa|child in middle school]] [[Rush Limbaugh|making shitty puns out of names and institutions]] and you get the point.  But of course conservatives are the real "adults" in the political world.  Wink wink.
