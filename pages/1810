Cowman109
'''Cowman109''' is a [[Wikipedo]] [[Bureaucratic Fuck]] who cant go more than ten minutes without sticking his spic nose into other peoples business.  Like most of the people occupying higher positions in Wikipaedia he is either a [[13 year old boy]] or a [[pedo|full grown man]] pretending to be a 13 year old boy.

==About Cowman109==

Like a happy [[fat]] piggy rooting for delicious truffles in the forest he digs up any traces of interference, vandalism or just editing that he doesn't like and [[baleet|baleets]] it, before leaving an [[tl;dr|overly wordy]] explanation on his victims talk page.[[Image:Wikibadge.jpg|frame|right| Awarded For Bureaucratic Fuckery]]

Though there is little information to be gained from his front page, through lengthy examination of his [[tl;dr]] posts and some use of Google, ED has learned the following:

*His mother is some sort of spic or a beaner.
*He does not liek Mudkips.

==Oh Noes, not THE CABAL...==

Cowman109 wasn't content with merely adding and editing content, oh no.  Cowman109 is the Coordinator of the '''Mediation Cabal'''.  Scary, [[Amirite|amirite?]] This used to be a two person job until Cowman109 sucked a whole lot of [[e-penis]] and crawled and begged for them to open up another slot so he could wheedle into it.  It is worth noting that he was helped into this position by the Lord High Asshole of Bureaucratic Fucks:[[Mongo]].  It is widely believed the two were bought together initially by their love of rampant tree sex.  

Cowman109 may or may not have been involved in doing [[WTC]] with Mongo, but he has notably and very rapidly (because he has nothing better to do than watch the revision page all day long like a good [[basement dweller]]) [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&diff=prev&oldid=95156990| removed some awkward questions that were asked of Mongo]and then applied his cabalistic Banhammer to the guilty party, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=95157642  without trial or fair hearing,]for such is the [[unwarranted self-importance|mighty power]] he wields.  

The stated purpose of the Mediation Cabal is to mediate in arguments: this gives them the right to interfere in anything that may be disputed on Wikipedia (which is pretty much everything), quote dull policy at people and then [[masturbate]] frantically at their [[God]] like power to erase other peoples words from a computer screen.

Ironically one of the things that some of the people are complaining about are Cowman109's edits and reversions.  It is a tribute to the majestic inability of the [[cockmongler|cockmonglers]] at [[Wikipedia]] to ignore hypocrisy from their favoured few, that they are totally and utterly unable to acknowledge any conflict of interest in giving someone Admin powers ''and'' control over arbitration for people who feel they have been unfairly edited.  

If you are a Wikipedo then Cowman109 is your Judge, Jury and Executioner.  He is the head of the Wiki Gestapo.  Baleet yourself now, there is no more hope.

==Lol, whut?==

[[Image:cowmanNO.jpg|left|thumb| Cowman109 knows no mercy]]This little bitch has been [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cowman109 granted]the position of [[cunt|Arbitration Clerk.]] This means he documents all the episodes of Wiki-Banhammer wielding for posterity.  

So soon this teenager is able to edit and revert at will, refuse his victims any mercy in their arbitration, and then doctor the records so it looks like he has been completely fair.  

[[Lie|Wikipedia is democratic, fair and balanced.]] Just like Fox News.  

==KIA==

Cowman109 has made [[over 9000]] edits to the page discussing the phrase [[owned|KIA]] as part of one of the longest running disputes since the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hot_dog Great Hotdog Debate of 2001.] If you would like to troll him this may be a good place to start. You could start by asking how it is that a 13 year old boy knows so much about military terms.

==WIKIPEDIA IS RUN BY CHILDREN==

Seriously, how young do you need to be to have this level of knowledge about kids' films?

== THE PIANO - Play it Again, Sam ==

As mentioned previously, [[Lolcow|Cowman109]] plays the piano.  I think this pretty much ends any speculation that may exist about his [[gay|sexual orientation]].  Like all pretentious teenage boys with a sensitive side he wants to be [[attention whore|famous]] so has the obligatory YouTube channel.  

Also in keeping with his [[Wapanese]] [[Desu|pretensions]] he has learned to play music [http://uk.youtube.com/signup?next=/watch%3Fv%3DM22SVd2DOkE| from] [[Zelda]].

<s>Troll him on YouTube [http://uk.youtube.com/user/Cowman109| here]</s> (BALEETED).  Personally my sock puppets and I like to ask him to give us some [[Chocolate Rain]].  Actually as he is part [[Mexico|beaner]] he could maybe give us a burst of La Cuccaracha like the Taco eatin' motherfucker he undoubtedly is.
