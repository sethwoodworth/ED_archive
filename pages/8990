'''''Whirled''''' is an [[Bullshit|original]] game that is nothing like ''[[Second Life]]'' where users can upload and sell their own [[Dick|avatars]] [[Pregnant|created]] in flash and sell them in the in game store. [[ORLY|Of course]], players can also [[Prostitute|buy furniture for their rooms]], but [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about that]]. [[You|All players]] either [[Fail|play]] as the Pokemon [[Lucario]], something from ''[[Naruto]]'', or something free in the shop, since they [[Fail|are too lazy]] to [[Sex|play]] games to make any of the game's [[Jew Gold|currency]].

==The Store==

[[File:lolwut1.jpg|thumb|This is a normal reaction to the shitty store]]


Whirled allows [[Gamer|players]] to sell furniture, avatars, and backdrops made in Adobe Flash, [[This Looks Shopped|Photoshop]], Gimp and like programs. Avatars can be coded as .swf's that [[Gamers|players]] can play as [[Fap|to express their "originality"]] by playing as someone else's [[Abortion|creation]]. [[Fags|Noobs]] ignore this, and upload pictures of their favorite [[Pokemon]] or television show character and sell them for ungodly prices. This doesn't stop them from complaining about even the cheapest of prices. [[Fail|Why pay a lot when you can just bug the creator to lower the price]]?

Many players scream "Deat 2 Statikz" and other [[Lolcats|similar badly spelled and grammatically challenged messages]] to players who use avatars that are not .swf's. This has caused childish [[Flame War|wars]] to break out like the plague where players will purposely choose avatars that cause [[MMORPG|lag]] to annoy other players.

==Currency==

[[Image:Exploding_head_3.jpg|thumb|Average reaction to ''Whirled'''s currency system.]]

When pricing [[An Hero|an]] [[Dick|object]], the [[Your Mom|creator]] has the choice to sell it in coins or bars. When selling in coins, the creator gets [[nothing|virtual money]] when [[Fag|someone]] buys. When priced in [[Dick|bars]], the creator receives [[bling bling|Bling]] which can be cashed out for [[Jew Gold|money]] [[IRL]] whenever an item sells. One bar is equal to [[at least 100|at least one]] bling which is worth [[Over 9,000|nine]] cents. The creator only receives 30% of earnings, though, meaning for every bar's worth they sell they get three cents. In [[over 9,000]] weeks, the creator will have made [[at least 100]] cents.

==How to Win==

Unlike ''[[Second Life]]'', there is a scoring system in ''Whirled''.

*1. Join.
*2. Upload [[Over 9000|at least 100]] pictures of [[Naruto]] or [[Pikachu]] in the avatars section.
*3. Complain about how high avatar prices are.
*4. Buy an avatar of [[Furry|Lucario]].
*5. Walk into a heavily populated area.
*6. [[????]]
*7. [[PROFIT!]]

Bonus Points: Use a piece of [[CP]] as an avatar in a heavily populated area and time how long it takes to get banned.

==devianTARDs==

In hope of winning a new [[crap|MacBook]], flocks of [[devianTART|Deviant]] [[bullshit|artists]] joined whirled after [[devianTART]] started a contest to create the coolest room. This contest made furniture important, and thus the furniture market prospered, at the price of [[Retards]] running all over whirled.

People who play Whirled are a rejected breed of a homosexual who is forced to dwell in the far corners of the internetz in a shit hole well known as whirled.com

==How to know if someone you know is using Whirled==
1. They are a 13 year old boy.<br>
2. They are obsessed with Kawaii.<br>
3. They have a new boyfriend/girlfriend every 5 minutes.<br>
4. They rush home to participate in an internet war.<br>
5. They know a 13 year old boy.<br>
6. They know every word to the Caramel Dansen.<br>
7. They are obsessed with Moogles.<br>
8. They are azn.<br>
9. They talk about Whirled like it is important and act like people care about what they have to say when they are referring to Whirled.<br>

True fans of Whirled can simply live off of wars for weeks at a time. Wars are not based on actual game skill its more of a game of who is the biggest bullshitter with the gayest avatar, almost like those games you played when you were a kid with your friends and you always made up a new power that made you win every 5 seconds...oh did I say almost I meant exactly.

==History of Whirled Wars==
Whirled used to be a peaceful place of dwelling with the occasional troll until one day some (fake) financial genius Dethbate decided to use the popular Thing Thing games and make Thing Thing [[avatar]]s. Soon enough he had been the first person except for that [[fag]] that made moogle avatars to make millions of coins (because bars are fucking retarded pay-to-play crap on a free site). He had a legion of [[over 9000]] mindless followers with loads of coins willing to suck his balls off for free Thing Thing [[avatar]]s, which he didn't give out, cause he was a greedy fucktard. At the peak of his sales he decided to make a group called Thing Army which was a plague of [[over 9000]] 12 year old boys who harassed and begged group moderators for free [[avatar]]s or a promotion. When the 12 year old boys did not receive promotions they were threatened to either leave, cry, or make a group that hated Thing Army...but still begged for free [[avatar]]s.<br><br>
When they still did not receive free [[avatar]]s they would find a way into the Thing Army rooms and molest their cap locks button and type their little hearts out. They soon realized that did not work because people had the ability to mute them. The 12 year olds then became [[butt hurt]] and started working for money either by playing [[unfunny|lolcaptions]] and made every caption "that's what she said" or "[[your mom]]" in order to appeal to their peers making them rich so that they could now afford Thing Thing [[avatar]]s.<br><br>
With [[avatar]]s gained, they now came into Thing Army rooms and began pretending to shoot members and acting like they were spying on Thing Army and knew about their secret plans. This sparked an idea in Dethbates head to go to war with his [[butt hurt]] 12 year olds only for personal gain. Dethbate made a new rule that you could only participate in war if you had a certain Thing Army [[avatar]] which made him make even more money. Wars started in public places and usually lasted [[over 9000]] hours until one of the 12 year olds had to get off because it was their bedtime. Wars annoyed the rest of the whirled but Dethbate chose not to stop them until he himself was annoyed with them because he was no longer making money so he quit Thing Army. Upon quitting, he left Thing Army to someone who had really been running it the whole time while he had been [[fap]]ping to the amount of money he made.

Later, Dethbate repeated his scheme, refreshing the look of the avatars he made to resemble the actual Thing Thing Games rather than shitty knockoffs, creating another group and using the hundreds of new followers to gain exorbiant amounts of coins with little to no effort, which was generally pointless as the [[fag]]s that run whirled decided that anything listed in a bars price could only be bought by [[butthurt]] 12 year olds who begged their parent for [[over 9000]] dollars in whirled moneys. Dethbate probably made more money for claiming to be fighting the establishment by listing his creations for low amounts of coins.

==Whirled through eyes of a normal person==
Dear Diary, 


Today on whirled I made [[At Least 100|a bunch of Statics]] mad, but they're [[Pedobear|pedofiles]] anyway. I played tetris, I got 227 coins after just one hour! Maybe I can get that Kawaii [[emo]] avatar now!<br> 
Anyway, [[brb|I gotta go]] eat 5 buckets of [[KFC]]. 

Bye diary!

==Whirled through the eyes of a Static==
todsy i was tking wit my bf, and he told me that he was cheastingsd on me wit 4 gurls!
but i went to superdoll.com and made a hot  avatar. dsfafgtrhtwgerwt352323545rgdfvsdacasdcsadcsdcsdaffdgdfgrghgfbfdfsvscsadsqwre2e144356567hgtbbsdbvdfvsdafert45rt65436567577878 iz my avatar sexee?
==Whirled through the eyes of [[Anonymous]]==
LOLOLOLOLNo.
==Kawaii==
Originated when some [[fag]] joined Whirled under the name of Cherub released the base for Kawaii.
When it became popular, a bunch of [[retards]] started making edits non-stop.
Now in every place you go, there's a 99.9% chance you'll see a 
fucking Kawaii avatar if it's not a group of [[furries]] or [[pokemon]] fags.
Either way you still have to see's those pieces of [[shit]].
Thankfully the base is nowhere to be found on Whirled, and the popularity decreased a bit.
You can still find the base on sharing sites as 4shared or 2shared.

PWOB:Person without Bars.
