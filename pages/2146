Decantering
{{Quote|What's more, it's magnificent and jaw-dropping.|''Kami no Shizuku''}}

'''Decantering''' is a corruption of the word "decantation" (from the verb "decant"), which is the process of removing solid sediments from wine. It involves pouring wine from the bottle into a flask-like vessel known as a "decanter". Normally, making and working with wine [[Boring|wouldn't be exciting]], but a manga artist decided to create a manga about wine [[Trying too hard|anyway]]. The end result is ''Kami no Shizuku'' (fr: ''Les Gouttes de Dieu'', en: ''Drops of God''), which is a dramatic manga about a son trying to claim his inheritance through a [[Facepalm|wine tasting contest]].

The silliness involved in creating a manga about wine attracted the attention of [[A/|/a/]], and an [[old meme]] was born. /a/ was amused by the fact that protagonist Kanzaki Shizuku is able to dazzle everyone in a restaurant by decanting wine from such a height.
