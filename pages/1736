Connex Trains pwn3d
[[Image:ConnexTrains.jpg|thumb|200px|Truth in advertising.]] Connex is the metropolitan rail operator for the city of [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. It has the power to piss off every passenger by overcharging for tickets, only hiring [[batshit crazy]] drivers and being more inconsistent that michael jackson's skin colour. The only thing made of moar fail is Cityrail in [[Sydney]], and to a lesser extent, [[Brisbane|Brisbane's]] Queensland Rail.

==OMG HAX==
On February 23, 2007, awesome and anonymous irltrolls hacked the Connex system which sends SMS text message notifications to registered customers, sending messages from Connex telling them that ticket inspectors loved killing people and would help bomb a train.

Connex has claimed it will prosecute the trolls responsible. However, if Connex's investigations department are in the same technical league as the retarded fuckjobs who run the rail network itself, [[Anna Nicole Smith]] will be snowboarding in hell before they find out whodunnit.
