The term ''shout out'' refers to the practice of properly according respect to one's friends on some type of available media. This includes [[television]], [[old media| radio]], and the [[internets]]. It is used by [[16 year old girls]], [[God|religious people]], black person, [[wiggers]] and [[weev]]. Its internet form often uses [[altcaps]] or specialized images made by the one [http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=icyblugurl shouting] out.

==Linguistics==
It is believed to be a bastardized form of the urban slang ''props'', a practice wherein one black person properly accords respect to another brother, usually in the form of hand-clasping, rap lyrics, or not shooting them.

==Origins==

The [[Bible]] mandated obligatory shout outs to [[God]], incorporating various hand gestures and postures involving submissive stances and offering easy anal access.  You are considered a bad [[Christian]] if you do not offer [[God]] your ass at least twice a day.  Many [[insane|fundamentalist]] Christians decry modern Christian rock forms of shout outs (incorporating [[Jesus|J.C.]] into their lyrics), citing lack of anal exposure.

[[Muslim]]s adopted the most vulnerable of positions due to their inherent [[homosexual]]ity.  The terms ''prayer'' and ''assuming the position'' are interchangeably used in modern times.

==Various uses==
*After winning a fight, a boxer will give a shout out to [[God]] for allowing him to be victorious.  This is immediately followed by a shout out to whatever criminal (i.e. Don King) promoted the fight.  Shout outs are immune to [[religion|hypocrisy]].
*[[Rap|Hip Hop]] lovers will call their local radio station to give shout outs to their friends.  These friends will normally be named after cartoon characters ("snoopy") or hair care products ("aqua net").
*[[white trash|White people]] will call news shows and wait two hours so they can give a shout out to [[old media|Howard Stern]] and giggle like a school girl with two fingers in her lap.
*[[Nerd]]s will give shout outs to [[Linux|lame operating systems]] and [[RPG]]s in internet forums to help increase their [[street cred]] with [[homosexual|nerd hags]] 

==Types of shout outs==
*Big ups
*Props
*Holler
*Whatever the hell a medieval town crier did (cried probably)
*Romanian impalings
