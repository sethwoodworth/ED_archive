Yamanote Halloween Train

==Japan and its Glorious Subway==
[[Japan]], like [[Middle East|many weird little countries]] that do not matter in the grand scheme of our excellent, more civilised world, have little and no interest in the western festival of [[Halloween]]. In order to educate the [[Otaku]], many normal people, or ''GaiJin'' hold a yearly [[Mantrain|celebration]] on the Yamanote line of the Japan central subway system. This is an excellent excuse to [[Win|drink, sing, strip, offend]], and generally give the indiginous people some trick or treating to remember.
The traditional [[Wapanese]] have proven themselves time and time again to be overly [[Butthurt|sensitive]] when it comes to hijinks on their subway, as seen by:

*The 1995 Aum Shirikyo Sarin attack
*The fact that the tranport authority have had to introduce women only subway cars due to all the illegal [[almost rape|groping]] being perpetrated.
*The [[banning]] of a Japanese game in which you rape [[women]] on the subway. RÃ¦p is literally the only purpose of the game. Sounds fucking awesome.
*The gagging order stopping officials releasing a girl's name as her family were dissatisfied with the way her death on the subway  was handled by the staff of the underground train network, random move.
For one night a year, our brave brethren of drunk middle class white people in their early 20s allows them to forget their woes and have not just a journey, but a party too. A gift to the people who [[hate|make them feel so welcome]].


==Gaijin, on my Yamanote Line?==

The Yamanote Halloween [[Mantrain|Train]] Celebration has been going on since the early 80's, and is generally a [[Habbo Hotel|non violent]] gathering of westerners exercising their Dubya given right to do whatever the fuck they want, wherever the fuck they want to.
Unfortunately, the advent of AL Gore's invention: The Internets has given those pesky Japs the [[2chan|means]] to share information about the celebration, and, even more worryingly, protest the fact that their cheif mode of transport is essentially ruined one night of the year because of the whims of [[people|retards]] not even vaguely interested in any other part of their way of life. 

Another point of contention from the Japs is that many of their womenfolk join in the celebration, and this, as we know from every [[Hentai]] ever made, simply does not gel with the Japanes notion of what women should be doing.

==2Chan==

In October 2009, members of 2Chan, the biggest discussion board in Japan, caused a furore when the plans regarding the partytrain, no relation to the [[partyvan]], were blown out of all proportion on the board. Before you could say [[Weeaboo]], plans were being made to push '''GaiJin''' under the tracks and people were threatening to [[I'M PRESSIN CHARGES|press charges]] against the partygoers, mostly on false statements. Further fuelling the hate, the harshly worded email above was sent to an online magazine. Harrowing stuff there. Many potential partygoers were put off by the flamewar, and the actual party ended up being a [[failed|piss poor]] attempt to stick to fingers up at their slanty eyed nemeses.

Please note below: The Yamanote Halloween Train was once awesome.
