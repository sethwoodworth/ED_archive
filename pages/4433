Judas YouTube blacklist
[[Image:Digitil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Renetto]]'s Guilt pushes [[DiGiTiLsOuL]] over the edge]]

The Judas YouTube blacklist—more properly the  internet YouTube entertainment industry blacklist, into which it expanded—was the twentieth-first-century list of real people, actors, directors, musicians, and other entertainment non-professionals who were denied being featured on YouTube because of their political activites in [[THE PROMISED LAND]] or associations, real or suspected. Contributors of YouTube were barred from work on the basis of their alleged membership in or sympathy toward [[LiveVideo]], involvement in liberal or simply hyprocritical political causes that enforcers of the blacklist associated with [[argentism]], and/or refusal to assist federal investigations into [[YouTube]] activities; some were blacklisted merely because their names came up at during [[Renetto]]s' unoffical ''e-hearing''. Even during the period of its strictest enforcement, the late oughts through the early ones', the Judas blacklist was rarely made explicit and verifiable, but it caused direct damage to the non-careers of scores of YouTubers, often made betrayal of friendship (not to mention principle) the price for a livelihood, and promoted ideological censorship across the entire e-community.

==Important to Note==
*As the YouTube nation moved into the mid ought sevens, the attitudes and institutions of Renetttoism slowly weakened. Changing public sentiments undoubtedly had a lot to do with this, but one way to chart the decline of [[Renetto]] through a series of bullshit accusations and the [[FilthyWhore]] sex scandal.
*Many argue the Judas YouTube blacklist died on Thursday, Feburary 22, 2007. This occured when YouTube featured the popular jew-boy, [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=jackdanyells Jackdanyells] (obvious). Jackdanyells is/was a contributor to LiveVideo; however, shockingly enough[[YouTube]] featured Jack again for third time. The only catch was this time, they actually let Jack edit the front page of the site. Thus, many see this as the death of the blacklist[http://www.livevideo.com/jackdanyells].
*Blacklisting sometimes results in a ''domino effect'', as in the case of [[DiGiTiLsOuL]],  who was one of the many [[YouTube]]traitors blacklisted during the [[Renetto]] era.

===Definition of Judas:===

*Judas 
- someone who betrays under the guise of friendship double-crosser, double-dealer, traitor, two-timer, betrayer - a person who says one thing and does another.

*Judas
