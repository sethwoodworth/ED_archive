Operation Earl Grey
[[File:Tea_party_tea_leaf.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|"Anonymous" soccer mom]]
In late July 2010, a picture depicting a well-known [[Anonymous]] slogan being used by the [http://anonym.to/?http://oregonteaparty.ning.com/ Oregon Tea Party] appeared on [[reddit]]. The slogan was the classic "We are Anonymous, We are Legion, We do not forgive, We do not forget" line.  Soon afterwards, [[Oregon]] soccer mom [[teabaggers|tea party members]] were seen bearing signs emblazoned with the slogan.

While it's ironic that a group of irate [[conservative]] American [[NORPS]] would even want to be associated with a slogan that carries with it a stigma of [[internet hate machine|cyber bullies]], the phrase happened to be valuable [[oxymoron|intellectual property]] of [[Anonymous]], [[711chan|some]] of [[Partyvan.info|whom]] were [[offended]] enough to attack the Oregon Tea Party in retaliation, running raids dubbed "Operation Earl Grey" and "Operation Teabag."

==Conspiracy?==

Some have claimed that this is a clever Tea Party attempt at turning [[internet hate machine|channers]] into a [[personal army|political activism machine]].  However, the [http://tinyurl.com/26bghjb July 22nd Google Cache of the Oregon Tea Party profile on teapartypatriots] clearly shows otherwise. They also admitted to stealing the slogan and tried to placate the angry mob by straight up brown-nosing, praising Anon's tactics and resourcefulness, as shown: "Anonymous: we appreciate your resources and admire your tactics. You have taught us more than you know. As you requested, we are no longer using the Anonymous quote."


==Victory Through Spam==

[[Partyvan.info]] were the first to attack the tea partiers.  The primary strategy consisted of spamming "DESU" all over the Oregon Tea Party's Facebook page.  In response, the Oregon Tea Party went [[friends only|invite only]] and effectively killed Anonymous' ability to do any attacks or trolling on Facebook.  Recognizing their own success, the tea partiers went friends-only across the board, on every website and profile that could have anything to do with them.

==What Anonymous Wanted==

The main goal of '''Operation Earl Grey''' was nothing more unusual than to get the tea party members to [[lulz|screw up and do funny stuff]].  Anonymous claimed with the usual [[unwarranted self importance|highfalutin bravado]] that it was on a holy mission to punish the Oregon Tea Party for copyright theft and breach of "[[Rules of the internet|rules one and two]]."  

==Real Results in 90 Days or Less: Dox==

Somehow, the trolls managed to get the [[dox|personal information]] for a [[obvious|public figure]].  Geoff Ludt is the "[[Obama|organizer]]" of the Oregon Tea Party, and as such is the main target for Anonymous' hatred.  They found his email addresses (geoffludt@gmail.com, geoffludt@gmail.com), [http://www.ludt.com personal website], full name ([[powerword|Geoffrey Lewis Ludt]]), phone numbers ((503) 329-6932 (work), 503-320-4399, 503-320-8458, 301-302-4539 (tea party official)), home address (231 88th Ave., [[Portland]], OR 97216), [[job|place of business]] (Ludt Violin Co., 10244 SW Taylor St. [[Portland]], OR 97225-7058), date of birth ([[old people|1973-11-12]]), and history of donations to Presidential candidates ($220 to [[Mike Huckabee]] in 2008).
