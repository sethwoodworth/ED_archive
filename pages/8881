==FACT==
[[Jews did WTC|IFPI DID OINK LOL IFPI]]
==It's not a replacement for [[Oink]]!==
[[Image:Not%3Doink.png|frame|center|Nope...nothing to do with [[OiNK]]!]]
The mods have made it clear that Waffles.fm is no replacement for [[Oink]] nor is affiliated with [[Oink]] in any way.  Anybody suggesting otherwise will receive the [[banhammer]].

==Ratio==
Bragging about your ratio is the only way to make your [[Epenis]] bigger.  Of course everybody's ratio is [[Over 9000]] now that free-leech has been in effect forever.  If you can't become a power user then they don't love you and you fail at the [[Internets|Internet]].

==[[What.cd]] Drama==
When Oink died, tons of [[shit nobody cares about|sites]] want to become Oink's replacement.  A 14 year old boy who was [[butthurt|STEAMED]] over waffles bigger [[Epenis]], he wrote this letter to the users of What.cd, another [[Oink]] wannabe.
[[Image:Cherrywafflebite.jpg|thumb|Waffles get creamed.]]
<pre>
Dear registered user of the site [What.cd,

We have recently been investigating the activities of the 
users of the site http://www.what.cd/ and we have found that 
this site exists for the sole purpose of music piracy.

Pirating music is a criminal offence and we believe it should 
be obvious to you that the results outweigh the benefits - hard 
working artists won't be rewarded for their work and will stop 
producing music, ultimately leading to a severely reduced 
selection of music both in the shops and for download.

The RIAA had hoped that the disabling by the police of the large 
illegal music site, Oink.cd, would stop a lot of people from 
engaging in piracy, as they don't want to be seen as criminals. 
However, this appears to not be the case, as two large new sites 
have sprung up in its place.

This email is the final warning to all of you who were members of 
Oink.cd and are current members of What.cd. If we find you to be 
committing any more criminal acts of piracy then we will have to 
press charges against you, as representatives of the major record 
companies of America.

Yours Faithfully,

The RIAA
</pre>

This letter of course created tons of [[drama]] and made everybody at [[Failure|What.cd]] [[delete]] their account and move to waffles.    [[Fags|What.cd admins]] are still [[butthurt|RAGED]] over this.

==Users==
Waffles.fm is inhabited mainly by hyperactive [[retards]]. One particular retard who goes by the name of [[mutescream]] claims to be one of the [[Darwin Award|smartest]] individuals in the [[world]]. However, his constant [[Comment whore|inability to construct coherent sentences]] blatantly contradicts his claims of inhuman [[Stupidity|intelligence]].

The forums are populated by psychotic moderators who are complete assholes to anyone who doesn't suck up to them. They enjoy going on power trips and masturbating by themselves in their rooms. 

Another Waffles.fm [[wanker]] named [[Moron|DiMO]] constantly claims to be one of the world's [[Internet poor|richest ]] people. He IRCs 24/7 from his mansion that is (presumably) located somewhere in Hollywood and spends his nights getting mad [[cock|pussy]]. Or so he would have you believe.

There is also a [[fag]] that uses the nick of [[Attention_whore|Ratti]], whose most notable achievement is kicking himself out of an irc channel for being gay, something which he has done more than once.

The channel does have one notable[[Troll]] (well it did, until he got banned for it), however, named [[pwned|battleof1812]]. This user consistently displays an [[virgin|inability]] to interpret even the most basic forms of data and statistics presented to him, despite the [[Reality|claims]] made on his part to be a [[Cut|forensic pathologist]]. Perhaps such [[Fail|incompetence]] would explain why he is not performing medical procedures on living people, as they would likely sue him for malpractice. Such chutzpah is very commonly seen in [[IRC]] channels. His profound [[Bullshit|contradictions]] are sometimes misconstrued as reality, but, as any reasonably intelligent being will recognize, they are merely words that should be treated as something to be [[KILL_IT_WITH_FIRE|mocked]] as often as [[furries|humanly]] possible.

===Waffles.fm users are good at math:===
{{Quote|HOWEVER, the average ratio for this site does not have to be one, and in fact, it will always be higher. to prove this, pretend there is a site with only two users. one downloads 40 mb and uploads 20 mb, and the other downloads 20 mb and uploads 40 mb. the first users ratio is .5 and the second users ratio is 2, and the average of their ratios is 1.25.|Waffles handle: josh}}
