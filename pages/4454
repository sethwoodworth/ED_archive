Justin Catalano is a young [[Teenager|teenaged]] [[Homosexuality|gay]] [[man]] in [[Rhode Island]]. He is the founder of the "hair club for men", the [[1772 Society]]. He lives in Warwick, Rhode Island [[Basement-dweller|out of his parents house]] and trades fake stocks on his [[Facebook]] account because he doesn't have any real [[money]] to trade real stocks, because he lost it all on the market. Justin is a supposed "[[conservative]] [[republican]]" and a wannabe [[future]] [[Politics|politician]] but unfortunately for him, he is as fake as the tan on his sister [[Courtney Catalano]]'s legs.

Justin hates [[Islam]] and all other [[religion]]s except for [[Jesus]] Christ. Wake up Justin, Jesus is [[Death|dead]].

==Political Aspirations==

Justin wishes to one day become a politician. He even went as far as setting up a "society" so that 10 years from now he can show the documentation and proof that he was dedicated to the politics that he stands for. The [[1772 Society]] began as an attempt to boot strap his political future. Unfortunately for him, politicians are supposed to be caring, sensitive people, not [[H8|bigots]]. Justin claims to be a voracious traveler, when in fact the only thing we know he is voracious for is large amounts of dong.

==Stock trading activity==

Justin is a staunch supporter of [[oil]] stocks (moar like oily cocks, amirite?). He defends oil companies and makes fun of people who are looking for alternative power sources on the sole basis that he has to contradict what at least 50% of the country wants. Justin has made many large investments in oil companies but lost thousands of dollars (most of his savings) last year and recently because he is too [[retard]]ed. Instead of getting a real degree in some sort of [[science]], he chose to [[fail]] at [[life]] in the liberal arts sector. Because of the loss from trading stocks. Justin, despite looking like he may be [[success]]ful, buys his suits with [[Ryan Bilodeau]] at the [[George Zimmer|Men's Warehouse]], lives at home with his [[Your Mom|mommy]], and borrows money from his [[daddy]] to pay bills. It is a known [[fact]] that Justin is [[poor]] and mooches off his family.

==Justin's [[H8|hatred]] and bigotry==

It is well known and supported that Justin is basically a [[Nazi]]. He hates black person, Jews, and all Islamic [[culture]]s. Yet he prides himself on being a "[[Terrorist|true son of liberty]]" and also a future politician. Justin, some advice, you can't go around documenting your hatred for other races and cultures, post it on the [[Internet]], then run for office. You see this stuff gets archived and documented, and will come back to bite you in the ass anytime you try to run for a public office. The [[1772 Society]] is a hate group.

==Justin's ties to [[Ryan Bilodeau]]==

[[Ryan Bilodeau]] is the famous Rhode Island young republican that was ruined by [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Justin took over for Ryan when Ryan was too ruined to be effective. Hopefully Justin is ruined like Ryan was and will stop his retarded attempts at trying to improve his chances in politics. He is probably too busy inhaling furious amounts of [[cock]] to care.
