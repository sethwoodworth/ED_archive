Grogv
'''Grogv''' is a branch of the 1.0 trunk of [[Dikkv]], a creation of the [[GNAA]]. It is very similar to Dikkv, except it uses a database of quotes from world-famous faggot [[Grog]].

To invoke Grogv, % php grogv.php, making sure to edit the file to choose which [[IRC]] network and channel you wish to annoy with sexually insecure comments about fucking women from various countries.

Grogv is released under the GNPL (Gay Nigger Pubic License).
