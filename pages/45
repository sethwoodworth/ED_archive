#A gay Van Halen album released in, you guessed it, 1984. 
#A novel written circa 1948 AD by George Orwell, telling the story of an overpopulated society where humans eat a [[delicious_cake|delicious treat]] called Soylent Green. In this [[Communism|socialist utopia]], everyone is watched by an entity called [[Facebook|Big Brother]]. The sheep population is reminded of this [[fact]] by ubiquitous [[propaganda]] posters displaying the [[meme|catch-phrase]], "[[Mark Zuckerberg|Big Brother]] is watching [[You]]". The protagonist, a proud worker of [[Wikipedia|The Ministry of Truth]], has [[sex]] with a lot of [[women]] and is then [[BSDM|tortured]] by a government agent named [[unfunny|Conan O'Brien]]. In the image to the right, you can see the female who liberates us all from the evil that is Conan O'Brien.
# 1984 wasn't written as an instruction manual.
#*[[Liberals]] love to make analogies to this [[old media|book]] all the time, because [[America]] is such a totalitarian, fascist state where you can be imprisoned for saying anything bad about the government.  
#*You may notice that [[Satan|"84" is "48" reversed]].  This is [[lie|purely coincidental]] and [[bullshit|in no way relates to]] the [[Jews|Jewish conspiracy]].
#*As we all know, 1984 in reality was [[sarcasm|exactly as depicted in the book]]. George Orwell is a fucking [[retard|genius]]; we should just call him George ORACLE or something, [[amirite]]?
# 1984 was also the year my cat died because I [[fisting|fist fucked]] him. RIP Snuggles.
# Some fag named [[User:Saivert|Saivert]] gives head 1,984 times a day
# George Orwell totally intended for his book to be read by high school freshmen and teachers who work for a government funded organization. There is no irony in a teacher who doesn't understand the [[Communism|history]] the book is using as context.
# The year the [[Internets]] was invented by [[Al Gore]].
# The year that ''Breakin' 2: [[Electric Boogaloo]]'' was released.
