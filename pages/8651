'''UOGamers: Demise''' is an ''[[Ultima Online]]'' freeshard which caters to more [[pussy|timid]] players who [[bitch|complain]] when there isn't a [[shit|Trammel]] [[X? In my Y?|ruleset map in their shard]].  The [[shit nobody cares about|economy]] is [[shit]]; even buying items with only a few half-decent mods costs tens of thousands of [[jew gold|gold]].  Essentially, you need to [[masturbate|farm]] for [[over 9000]] hours to be able to amass the necessary amounts of [[jew gold|jew golds]] to buy a powerscroll so your skills don't [[fail|suck]].

[[Oh Exploitable|However, it should be noted that it is very easy to amass absurd amounts of cash in short amounts of time]].  Simply make a crafter, work up your skills and sell your [[shit]].  After you get 50,000 [[Jew gold]], roll up a [[nerd|mage]], go to [[furry|Heartwood]], and buy a [[hippie|Spellweaving]] book and [[hax|macro]] yourself into godhood.  Use your newfound powers to [[SHOOP DA WHOOP|blast the fuck]] out of any hostile creature you see; the tougher the better.  black person are recommended for ease of [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|killing]] and relatively decent [[shit|loot]].

Basic way to win at this [[shit]]:

*1) Use above info to reach [[hax|godhood]].
*2) Amass absurd amounts of [[jew gold]].
*3) Spend said [[jew gold]] on absurdly good equipment to ensure your invincibility.
*4) Buy a house.
*5) Form a [[hugbox|guild]].
*6) Invite random [[13 year old boy|noobs]] into said guild to amass an army.
*7) Go to [[4chan|Felucca]] and [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|KILL FUCKING EVERYTHING]].
*8) Congratulate yourself on being a complete [[retard]].
*9) Realize your life was wasted trying to [[win|do the impossible]].
*10) Become [[an hero]].

Sadly, even if you [[win]], you still [[epic fail|fail terribly]] and do not [[PROFIT|profit]].  Actually devoting any time to this [[shit|shard]] in any serious manner will immediately cause your life to [[divide by zero]] and you will [[die alone]] [[at least 100]] times.  Sorry, [[retard|bub]].

== [[Retard]]ed Events ==
Every now and then, the [[batshit insane]] [[admin]]s decide in their complete [[retard|idiocy]] to [[mindfuck]] their players with completely illogical quests and "[[shit|events]]".  These are usually marked with [[shit]] appearing in town (usually [[forum|Britain]]), telling you that [[OH SHI-|something has gone awry]].  You have two choices at this juncture:

*1) Be a [[retard]] and investigate.  You find clues, but they lead to complete dead ends.

- OR -

*2) Ignore this [[shit]] and go about your [[masturbation|business]].

Taking the [[shit|2nd path]] leads to less [[fail]] (although that is nigh impossible on this shard), but you miss the [[shit nobody cares about|uber-1337 items]] that you get for [[LOL WUT|being a good]] [[retard|investigator]].  Most of this [[shit]], however, is practically [[fail|useless]] considering you can just farm for better stuff.  [[Fail|Good going]], [[you]] [[retard|fucking retards]].
