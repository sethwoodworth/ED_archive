'''''Bioshock''''' is an [[FPS]][[RPG]][[MMO]][[OMGWTFBBQ]] released in [[2007]] for the [[Xbox 360|Ecksbawks 360]] and [[PC]] (and in 2008 to the PS3) to the commercial [[A winner is you|success]] of [[Basement dweller|basement dwellers]] and critical success of [[Video Game Critic|game reviewers]] alike. The genre was later shortened to FPSRPG (First-Person Shooter Role-Playing Game) so that it could fit on the game box, and eventually shortened to just FPS when the game's developers realized that [[Fable 2|the game had practically no RPG elements]]. The game is noteworthy for being good enough to be worthy of note, for having a [[ZOMG]] DEEP storyline, and for being the only [[video game]] in anyone's memory that allowed the player to brutally [[rape]] and [[murder]] little girls. You can replicate the experience by playing any Fallout game (preferably Fallout 3) while reading ''Atlas Shrugged''.

===Plot in under 5 seconds===
[[Ayn Rand]] under the sea. You enter an underwater city called... surprise surprise [[Bible|"Rapture"]]. You kill things, strangle/rape little girls, [[Cockblock|Big Daddies]] for the right to strangle/rape them, and inject some sort of blue glowing liquid into your veins. Its like that weekend [[Oldfag|back in 98]]...


===Plot in [[tl;dr]]===
You play as some guy whose name really isn't important, and whose goal is to rescue some [[loli]] and kill people with both [[Gun|guns]] and by taking narcotics to grant you magic powers.  The game is set during 1960, when the protagonist's [[9/11|plane crashes]] into the <s>World Trade Center</s> Atlantic Ocean, where he discovers a hidden city at the bottom of the ocean called "Rapture". Of course, the city is in a state of despair worse than that of [[Nawlins|New Orleans]] after Hurricane Katrina (<s>minus</s> including the black people [[George Bush doesn't care about black people|looting]]), and it's up to our [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] [[An hero|hero]] to solve the obligatory mystery surrounding the whole mess.

Your character starts out with nothing [[moar]] than a [[Dildo|wrench]] with which to beat his foes upside the head, but soon acquires some guns and [[drugs]] to help him along. The protagonist then starts shooting up the drugs ("plasmids") like a heroin [[addict]] going through withdrawal and learns that, through the magic of [[science]], he has gained [[Blowjob|special abilities]], such as the ability to spawn an army of [[dongcopter|wasps]] from his [[Penis|forearm]] or to [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|set shit on fire]]. The player then finds out that in order to recharge his powers, he has to continually take a high strength brand of heroin known as "EVE".

So, Jack (that's the protagonist's name, [[No|in case you really care]]) has to find a bunch of [[Jailbait|little girls]], called "Little Sisters", that have a kind of [[Semen|genetic material]] called "[[Jenkem|ADAM]]". After finding the little brats, it is then up to you to decide if you want to [[Rape|harvest]] or [[Almost rape|save]] them. But before you can do that, you have to contend with their guardians, called "Big Daddies". The Big Daddies are basically just tough [[Epic Beard Guy|motherfuckers]] in metal diving suits that will attempt to [[rape]] you with either a giant gun or a giant [[Cock|drill]].

There's also this guy named "Atlas" who [[buttsex|helps]] you along for about the first half of the game. He gives you [[PROTIP|useful advice]] on how to advance and kill the game's enemies, called "Splicers" (pronounced "sploicehs"). He guides you on your quest to kill Andrew Ryan, the city's creator. Well, it turns out that Jack's actually Ryan's illegitimate son. And what's moar, Ryan has you [[Sodomy|sodomize]] him to [[death]] with a golf club by using the phrase "[[safeword|Would you kindly]]...", the same phrase that Atlas has been using to control you! And Atlas isn't even Atlas, he's some black person named Frank Fontaine! Oh yeah, [[spoiler]] alert.

So then Jack's rescued by some [[German]] [[MILF]] named Dr. Tennenbaum, who houses the Little Sisters and used to run a child [[Prostitute|prostitution]] service before the city went to [[shit]]. Anyway, in case you [[Retard|haven't yet figured it out]], you have to go kill Fontaine and save the day. When you first meet Fontaine, he looks like a [[pretty cool guy|normal guy]], but when you fight him at the end of the game, he looks like a cross between The Incredible Hulk and [[Chris Benoit]]. Pretty much the dude jacked himself full of [[Meth|ADAM]] and became jacked and black ([[jenkem|A man with black skin on drugs!?]] NO WAI!) But don't worry, all you have to do is walk up and stick a syringe in his chest, and then shock him so that he can't move; wash, rinse, and repeat, and you'll beat this insultingly easy boss, who is then [[gang rape|stabbed to death]] by [[loli|little sisters]] with syringes.

[[Trying too hard|BUT WAIT! This isn't actually the final boss! After you've finished Fontaine, Pedobear comes out from the shadows and attempts to rape your freed Little Sisters. You have to fend off Pedobear until the Partyvan arrives, at which point he'll flee. After this, you've beaten the game, and you get to view the ending...]]

THE ENDING: The ending that you get is determined by how you behaved in the game, as a pitiful attempt by the developers to make it seem like the game has moar depth and variety than it actually has. If you saved every Little Sister that you came across (you [[pussy]]), then you get the good ending, where you're some kind of [[Gary Sue]] character that waits out his days watching his new daughters grow and everything's all perfect and wonderful. But if you killed even one Little Sister (you [[sick fuck]]), then you're some kind superpowerful [[Hitler|Hitleresque]] madman bent on [[Scientology|world domination]] and you crash a submarine into [[Jew York|New York]] or some shit. What's that, you'd like some sort of middle ground?  Well, tough shit.  This is all you get. It also totally set up for an EVEN DEEPER [[Failure|sequel]].

===Gameplay===
[[Image:Bioshock-gh.jpg|thumb|left|[[Godhand Edit]] version of ''Bioshock''.]]

Bioshock's gameplay can best be summed up as saying that it's sort of like that of ''System Shock 2'', an older [[PC]] FPSRPG. Actually, a better description might be to say that if you took ''System Shock 2'', submerged it in a bucket of water, Ridiculously dumbed down, and turned back time to the year [[Before the internets|1949]], that you would get ''Bioshock''. In [[fact]], ''Bioshock'' is often considered a "spiritual successor" to ''System Shock 2'', much in the way that you might tell your [[English]] professor that your [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] paper is a "spiritual successor" to the original.

But enough about that, let's talk about the game itself. First off, and as stated previously, ''Bioshock'' is [[your mom|very easy]]. Easy like you could probably beat the game in a few hours with your eyes closed while playing another game on a portable system. For instance, there are Vita-chambers, which revive you when you die, placed at about every other turn, so you have no real fear of dying. Furthermoar, any damage that you've inflicted to your enemies will remain after you die, so you could run through the whole game with a wrench if you wanted to. Of course, if you did this, then you'd miss out on abusing your abilities to do awesome things such as [[Zippocat|setting a dead cat on fire]] with Incinerate and throwing it at your enemies with [[Psion Guild|Telekinesis]]. To offset this, the developers released a new achievement, via [[Xbox Live]], that gives you 100 [[Shit nobody cares about|gamer points]] for beating the game on hard without using a Vita-chamber. Of course, this just means that you'll have to abuse the game's save function a little bit moar.

''Bioshock'' (moar like ''Biocock'', [[amirite]]?) is touted as an FPSRPG, but has very little RPG elements. The only real customization is that you can occasionally upgrade your weapons and put gene tonics on yourself. There's no inventory screen, so any food that you find you must devour on the spot like a starving black person child. Additionally, you can [[Hacker|h4x]] things in the game to make them work for you. Naturally, the word "Hack" made all of the basement dwelling gamers [[jizz]] themselves in delight, but it turns out the hacking is just playing a prettier version of the old [[Windows]] game, ''[[Homosexual|Pipe Dream]]''. It's also incredibly easy, and you could probably hack anything in the game with your feet.

The game is very atmospheric, and occasionally tries to get [[Creepypasta|scary]]. However, due to the aforementioned difficulty, the game [[Failure|fails]] miserably at doing this, since you can practically run around and beat down every enemy with your [[dong]].

==What's the matter?  Too DEEP for you?==

[[Image:Big Dog.jpg|thumb|right|[[Big Dog]] approves of ''Bioshock'''s depth.]]
[[Image:bioshock_water.jpg|thumb|left|Bioshock's idea of the libertarian nightmare.]]
[[Image:Redneck_toilet.jpg|thumb|left|What the libertarian nightmare really looks like.]]


''Bioshock'' is commonly praised for having a [[In the ass|deep]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]] story and for [[Bullshit|exploring the moral implications of the human condition.]] If you ever tell one of the [[Deep Thinker|deep thinkers]] who holds this mentality that it's just a video game, be prepared for a [[tl;dr]] dissertation on [[A frank discussion of mental illness|psychology]] and how you "just don't get how DEEP ''Bioshock'' is." Unfortunately, these people fail to see that it's a [[Lie|FICTIONAL VIDEOGAME]] and not a scientific study. At most, the game is just telling you that [[Ayn Rand]] was a fucking [[retard]], which is blatantly obvious to anyone who isn't one of [[Randroid|her kind]].


{{quote|BioShock has been praised for providing "an entirely new tool through which to explore philosophy, psychology, and morality."|From the ''Bioshock'' article on [[TOW]].}}

Much of this mentality probably stems from the fact that Rapture was a society built from the ideals of [[science]], [[art]], and [[Walmart|industry]] without any moral restrictions. It would appear that this lack of moral code, coupled with natural human behavior, led to the downfall of the Utopian society. It couldn't have been the fact that the citizens had the ability to electrocute each other with the snap of a finger. Nor could it have had anything to do with the fact that everyone in the city was [[Batshit crazy|batshit insane]], or that there were vending machines on every street corner that sold guns and ammo. Nope.

In reality, the ZOMG DEEP AND PROFOUND nature of ''Bioshock'' is just a device to drive the plot along while you're not freezing people and blowing them up with grenade launchers. Nevertheless, you could always use the downfall of Rapture to troll [[Atheism|atheists]] and [[libertarian|libertarians]] about what would happen to society if their retarded views were applied, but then again, it's just a video game.

[[Image:Hacker's delight.jpg|thumb|right|Finally! A [[Hackers on steroids|solution]]!]]

This speech, given by Andrew Ryan at the opening of the game, was posted on [[B|/b/]] one day as a means to oppose the [[censorship]] imposed by [[Moot]] and his [[The Chemo That Is Curing /b/|new posting rules]]. However, rather than simply [[sage]] the thread or call the [[OP]] a [[cocksucker]], the denizens of /b/ [[cuntpaste]]d the speech repeatedly, but changed it slightly to fit the various characters that they inserted into Andrew Ryan's place.  And thus, a sort of mini-[[meme]] was born. There have been a few attempts at recreating the original thread, but all have been complete [[You fail it|failures]]. Additionally, ''Bioshock'' threads are relatively common on /[[v/]], where the /v/irgins can be found arguing over the moral implications of the game and [[Masturbation|fapping]] to pictures of Little Sisters.

==DRM==
[[Image:Pedoshock.jpg|thumb|right|Another [[Pedobear]] shop.]]
In order to stop people from [[theft|stealing]] the game, the [[Fucktard|executives]] at 2K decided to put [[DRM]] in the PC version of ''BioShock'', thus limiting the amount of times the game can be installed. The limit was set at two, but has apparently been upped to five. The game accomplishes this by installing a root kit called "SecuRom" on your system, which can potentially rape your [[I GOT NORTON!|security]] and [[Lulz|fuck with your programs]]. Of course, this is not going to stop anyone from [[Pirate|pirating]] the game. So, in reality, all this does is cockslap 2K's paying customers in the face by treating everyone like a criminal. Naturally, tremendous amounts of [[nerd]] rage have stemmed from 2K's decision, with [[Flamewar|flames]] flying all across the [[Internets|tubes]]. Unfortunately, 2K has shown no signs of changing their policy, so you'll just have to continue killing splicers with [[faggot|Ken Levine's]] [[Fellatio|penis in your mouth]].
