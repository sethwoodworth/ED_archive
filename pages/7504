Sig
{{potential}}
[[Image:AnimeSig.jpg|thumb|Every sig ever made.]]
A '''sig''', or signature or faggot-flag, is a small image that is automatically placed at the end of a forum post. There are many different kinds of forums which allow users to display sigs, but it is most popular among [[Super Smash Bros|gaming communities]], [[animu]] clubs, and other [[WWOEC|fagpools]].
<br><br>

Think of a sig as the [[internets|internet's]] version of a tattoo:
*It's fucking [[gay|hardcore]].
*It [[Party van|goes with you everywhere]].
*[[Azn|Every single one looks the same]].
*It's DeviantART; rather, useless, [[Fan art|shitty design]].
*It indicates that [[you]] are a [[douchebag]].
*[[Fat whore|Fat chicks]] typically have more of them than anyone else. 


== Sig Making ==
[[Al Gore|Internet Jesus]] set in place seven specific rules for the creation of all sigs.

#Download grunge, tech, and abstract gfx brush sets from [[deviantart|deviantart]]
#Open bootleg copy of [[Photoshop|PhotoShop]] (or [[The GIMP]] if you're a [[pussy]] and not a [[pirate]])
#Create a canvas size 400x150
#Cover the canvas with random brushing
#Insert random anime or video game character and text, preferably in [[ALL CAPS]]
#Retire as Professional Graphic Artist
#[[????]]
#PROFIT!

''PROTIP:
For greater justice, pay no attention to how the lighting and color scheme relate to your sig's [[harem|animu character]].

== The Theorem ==
Extensive studies on forums and various forms of sig research have lead to the development of the formula
[[Image:Sig.jpg|frame|center|Science at work.]]
which shows that "devotion to Sigs is inversely proportional with social life."  [[Wikipedia|Some people]] argue that sigs can eventually lead to living in your parents' basement, and/or a van down by the river. This extensive research has basically shown what everybody already knew: that Sigs are reserved for gheys and jews. This theorem has been proven through the use of [[mudkipz]].

== National Sig League ==
'''Nationalsigleague.com''' (NSL for short) is the web's official home for [[serious business|sig battling.]] The world's top [[bullshit|graphic designers]] mingle here to discuss their [[rape|trade]], and to show their skills in combat.


{{Quote|Welcome to NSL, The National Sig League! The place to be if you’re into challenging yourself, having fun and battling in ways never before seen. NSL is after all a league so on top of [[pokemon|battling]] your [[wtf|art]] and all it’s cool features, you can have a chance to be in the top rankings!| NSL, true justice league}}

===Classification===
Upon joining the forums at NSL, you must be classified before you can begin battling. A potential [[fag|sig warrior]] must post five signatures, which will be judged by the [[unwarranted self importance|GFX Crew]]. 90% of the graphics crew twats will vote "novice" without even taking a glance at the sigs. Their signatures will usually be "simple" to reflect their expertise, as they have "evolved beyond complicated designs. This is also known as a [[lie|writers block]]. After intense deliberation from the GFX Crew, a sig warrior will be classified as one of the following: 

*[[newfag|Novice]]
*[[newfag|Moderate]]
*[[lurker|Intermediate]]
*[[basement dweller|Semi-Pro]] 
*[[basement dweller|Professional]]

After being classified, the warrior will hone his battle skills with the advice of senior [[basement dweller|SIG SUPER SAYAINS]]. [[lulz|The warrior's new devotion in life is the art of battling sigs.]]

===Battle System===
[[Image:Sigbattle.jpg|thumb|Typical sig battle.]]
The typical sig battle consists of two sig warriors battling to the death in hopes of winning ultimate samurai honor.

Once two warriors are ready to commence battle, they will hand their fate to the Battle Bot. The Battle Bot posts the sigs and the battle begins. Intense voting can go on for [[at least 100|at least one hundred]] years. Once all votes have been cast, the winner is revealed. 

*Winning a sig battle assures your breadwinning capabilities to [[noone|potential mates]], and a guaranteed spot in upcoming special olympic games.

*Losing a battle is certain ultimate shame, leaving no option but [[An hero]].

===Pro===
[[Image:Prosignerd.jpg|thumb|Professional artist fully equipped and battle ready.]]
The primary goal for any sig warrior is to reach the Professional level, which is said to be more prestigious than any [[IRL]] honor. 

Becoming a professional sig warrior is no easy task. Many warriors will spend countless hours training for this. A devoted sig warrior will [[waste|use]] a better part of his life perfecting his brushing skillz. Once a sig warrior's brushing skillz can produce enough depth, he will be knighted by Sir Paul McCartney. 

'''''He is officially [[gay|pro]]!'''''

After becoming an officially ranked Professional Artist, the sig warrior can either stay at NSL and receive handjobs daily from budding sig warriors, or graduate to the professional art world of [[deviantart|deviantart.com]].

== Ripping ==
[[Image:Ripped.jpg|thumb|left|It's true.]]
Ripping is the act of using someone else's sig in any way [[almost raped|without consent]]. Ripping is [[Serious_Business|serious fucking business]], therefore some sig rippers will go through [[penis|great lengths]] in trying to hide their [[Shit nobody cares about|crime]].

Sig makers take great pride in their [[haha|work]], and will prosecute to the furthest extent of the [[internet law|law]] if you are found ripping their [[shit|art]].

===Hypocrisy===
The thing is, every sig is a rip of something else. Sigs are collages of other peoples' work. A sig is comprised of brushes (not made by the sig maker), a render (not rendered by the sig maker) and shitty [[Photoshop]] effects (not programmed by the sig maker).

===Drama===
For [[lulz]] and guaranteed drama, raid a sig forum and rip everyones sigs.

== Confusion ==
There is an awful lot of [[retard|confusion]] between legitimate, actual banner art (such as insignias, recognizable logos, etc.) and sig black person.  For one, most graphic and web designers would spend anywhere between two hours to two weeks of [[fap|careful thought]] and [[drugs|planning]] to work on their company's design, page layout graphics, etc.  A signature designer, on the other hand, can usually make their [[shit|piece]] in about 10 minutes thanks to [[Google|Jew magic]] and [[Photoshop|CS3]].  Thus, in many communities, people who make signatures feel that they are [[bullshit|better than most graphic designers]] because their commissions takes less time to finish.  Of course, when quality isn't an issue, it's not surprising that people would be able to get [[lie|so much hard work done]].


'''Please Note''': Sig and SIG are equally [[fag]]gy but opposite in direction.<br>
*A SIG is a Special Interest Group created for the purpose of<br>    directing attention toward [[E-Bully|serious problems]] that can result<br>  in [[Megan Meier|tragic losses]] but often times end up becoming [[an hero|an hero]]. <br>
*A sig is a crappy graphic created for the purpose of<br>  [[attention whore|directing attention]] to one's self. 

==In the Media==
Sigs were made popular by [[unfunny|hilarious]] old meme Zero Wing, when Cats, the game's antagonist, commanded the player to "take off all sigs for [[lulz|great justice]]."  Unfortunately, [[furries|gamers]] thought the dialogue was an error in translation, and disregarded the message.  Goatse resulted.  Scholars still maintain that, had it been taken more seriously, Zero Wing could've made the intertubes [[over 9000|over nine-thousand]] times less ghey.  This position is generally known as the [[serious business|Riemann Zeta-Hypothesis]].
