'''Jim Gaffigan''' is a [[Dane Cook|famous comedian]] who frequently appears on [[Comedy Central]].  He got pwned by '''[[b/|/b/]]''' when [[b/|/b/]]tards [[hacked]] into Heather Blough's [[Facebook]] account and dug up some embarrassing private messages they've sent each other. Screen captures of the exchange were posted on [[b/|/b/]] and sent to internet [[celebrity]] news sites and a few articles were published, giving full credit to [[b/|/b/]] for the hack.

==The Private Messages==
In the messages, Gaffigan hits on [[slut|Blough]] and they flirt back and forth. Eventually she sent Gaffigan a few private [[nude]] pics and they decide to hook up at his hotel after the show.

During the [[raid]], the entire private message conversation between Gaffigan and Blough was captured, posted on [[b/|/b/]] and published.
Gaffigan, a married man, seems to intend to [[I accidentally X|accidentally]] his marriage by shagging the porn star in his hotel.

==Thanksgiving is not for whores==

During the [[b/|/b/]] [[raid]], a few private albums of [[Attention whore|Heather Blough]], who was revealed to be the personal account of [[porn]]star [[slut|Mellissa Midwest]], containing several [[nude]] pictures of her were made public, which made her brother rather [[rage|angry]]. In a private message he let's her know that she is no longer welcome to join the family on Thanksgiving. This too was posted on [[b/|/b/]] and articles.

==Breaking rules 1 and 2==
In a classic [[cancer]] move, several [[b/|/b/]]tards broke [[Rules 1 and 2]] by sharing info and taking credit for the [[raid]]. One was even quoted in an article:


{{quote|I was one of the of the /b/tards who participated in the raid on Heather Blough’s Facebook.
A bit of background, about a week ago someone who works with here posted her password on [[b/|/b/]], he had got it through a keylogger he really shouldn’t have been running (though I would argue she shouldn’t have been on Facebook while she’s supposed to be working); /b/ went mad, all trying to get in, change her password etc, anyhoo someone tipped her off and she went mad. The OP (original poster) kept giving us updates, one hilariously from “the toilets, I’m on my iPhone”, about what was happening, security coming in etc.

SO…the other night, someone came on and said “I’ve got her new password”, several /b/tards promising only to get her photos etc and not change her password or anything offered their email addresses and requested the details,. I did too, for a laugh, I figured I would be ignored. I was wrong. I recieved her password, and got into her Facebook account. I think I spent over an hour in there, accept friend invites to her from /b/tards, I also made her private photo albums viewable to anyone. Things got interesting when her brother came online and initiated chat, which I ignored. It was while I was in her account that he sent the “Don’t come home for Thanksgiving” message, it is included in the attached file. Not long after I finished and came online, some lulzkiller from /b/ had tipped her off.

ENCLOSED is everything I grabbed from the raid. I somehow missed some of the bits you have (they come from a different /b/tard) but screengrabbed any messages that were noteworthy (there wasn’t much), mostly the ones that confirm she is a dirty slut. Included is the ‘Thanksgiving’ message and also a tip-off she recieved about /b/, needless to say that individual will get his come-uppance.

Enjoy!

Oh and just one more thing, and this is important- I DID IT FOR THE LULZ!|[[Attention Whore]]}}
