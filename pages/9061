=Word Power Friendship=




In the beginning of 2001 Word Power Friendship or WPF was created by Trace Elliot and John Turtletaub. it has since become an international phenomenon. It is a two man comedy and musical group. Totally dope and mostly word. With innovative jokes that take on racism, the establishment, and religion. Their music is pure mockery in a style similar to Ween or Frank Zappa.
