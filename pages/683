Attack
[[Image:Usburn.gif|frame|right|Desecrative attack]]

'''''To attack'''''. Kidnapped verb used by "freedom of speech"-advocating cunts on Wikipedia commutatively instead of ''to criticize'', ''to bash'', ''to identify'' or ''to call by name'', as a [[power word]] to express victimhood and self-pity. The power word is an aspect of what [[The Wikipedia Review]]'s Jonny Cache [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=10531&view=findpost&p=37359 calls]:

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">How To Attack Your Enemy From A Position Of Pseudo-Wikness</blockquote>

The [[butthurt|butt-hurt]] makes [[wikipedophile]]s not address their emotional problem directly, having to resort to yet another distortion of meaning. The determinant nominalized verb is especially favored in nominal phrases such as ''attack site'', an umbrella for antiwikipedia Web sites discussing individual wikipedophiles, like [[Encyclop√¶dia Dramatica]], Wikipedia Watch, [[The Wikipedia Review]] and [[Wikitruth]], and pseudoantiwikipedia Web site [[Wiki Abuse]].

In Wikipedia's thick rulebook, the term ''attack site'' came to fruition [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:No_personal attacks#External_links|in a paragraph]] by [[SlimVirgin]], an [[attention whore]] whose drug-addled nervous system and easily irritable intestine get reflected on her anxious, greedy, aggressive writing style, typically including a condescending first-person, plural-number personal pronoun (''we need'') and vague impersonal pronouns (''it means''), expressing supposed need or obligation, a way of indirectly shoving her recommendations up people's asses in the form of ''[[not be confused with]]'', converting those recommendations into imperatives, then suddenly switching speeds by throwing a ''[[you]]'' fastball with an emotionally laden "I put words in your mouth" ''wholeheartedly'':

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;"><span style="background-color:yellow">We need to</span> create an environment where <span style="background-color:yellow">regular editors</span> feel supported when they're <span style="background-color:yellow">attack</span>ed from outside, not one in which they get attacked even more for trying to defend themselves. <span style="background-color:yellow">That means not kicking up</span> a giant fuss when links are removed, even if <span style="background-color:yellow">[[you]]</span> don't <span style="background-color:yellow">wholeheartedly</span> agree with the removal. <span style="background-color:yellow">It means not mocking</span> someone over and over in public because he reacted badly to being outed and asked for a link to an otherwise decent blog to be removed. <span style="background-color:yellow">It means not taking up</span> the cause of the attackers just because you think a policy proposal went too far.</blockquote>

Translation:

*we need to = I, the superior Jewess, do
*regular editors = I, the poor Jewish victim
*'''attack'''ed = talked about
*it/that means not doing = don't do
*you = you, the [[moot|asshole]]
<big>Oh, my God, they're attacking us <nowiki>[</nowiki>= me, the Jewess<nowiki>]</nowiki>! Attacks from everywhere! Attacks!</big>
