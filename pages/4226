'''Jarrad Willis''' was a 20 year old (soon to be 21) from Mt Eliza (near Melbourne), [[Australia]] who wrote something ghey on the net about shooting people and then became [[an hero|an hero]] after the media coverage it gained, [[lie|such a loss should never be taken lightly]] and his family's loss should <del>not</del> be the subject of jokes <del>unless you are a [[Juliana Wetmore|faceless cunt]]</del> without exception. On Saturday December 8th, 2007 he pretty much died for posting on [[b|/b/]] that he was about to pull a [[Robbie Hawkins]] and shoot-up The Grove mall in [[Los Angeles]]. After the [[FBI]]'s [[4chan]] divison [[spies]] ratted him out, [[m00tle]] got a visit from [[The Man]] and coughed-up his [[IP]] so's they could track down the wannabe [[an hero]] and [[spoiler|nip any potential threat]] in the bud. 

[[No|Think about this you anti-social nerds?]]

Jarrad was questioned and released after being charged with '''"[[god|creating a false belief]]"''', said a driver for the Aussie Party Van fleet. Australian police already knew Willis, they said, "because he [[lie|had done things like this in the past]]."

Australian authorities are currently looking for a long list of people also accused of '''creating a false belief''' including [[Jesus]], [[Scientology|Tom Cruise]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Jimbo Wales]] (and his [[true believers]] at [[TOW]]), and all the people who say [[Al Qaeda]] -and not the [[Jews]]- did [[9/11]].

==Aftermath==
Shortly after the drama subsided, the investigation and charges were dropped due to Criminal Police knowing less about Victorian law than their fellow [[USA|Americunt]] counterparts. Leaving the [[LAPD]] with an estimated $100,000 bill, and making Jarrad one of the [[IRL Troll|most successful IRL Trolls ever recorded]].

He is also responsible for the largest criminal newfag influx to 4chan that contributed to [[100|at least 100]] [[Unfunny|Raff you Ruse]] threads, and continues to wreak havoc amongst the denizens of /b/.

==[[Copypasta|The Threat]]==

==Oldfags==
[[Image:Jarrad_willis-what.jpg|thumb|left|[[7 proxies|Proxies Willis]]...do you use them?]]
The [[13-year-old boys|peanut gallery]] at [[b|/b/]], already all [[butthurt|atwitter]] about the hordes of invading [[newfags]] that are currently swarming to [[m00t]]'s all new [[Web 2.0]] designed [[:Image:Fresh_page.jpg|main page]], are now [[shitting bricks]] over an [[invasion]] of nosy [[old|reallyoldfags]] curious to see "what is all this 4chan.org and it's shenanigans?" 

Initial [[old media]] reports dubbed 4chan a [[social networking]] site and [[B|/b/]] is a [[blog]]. However, [http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,22897706-5014108,00.html at least one] finally gave credit to 4chan for [[LOLcats]].

[[LAPD]] by this time had already announced that should Jarrad be [[pwnt|convicted]], they will go after him for an estimated  $100,000 in damages to [[butthurt|cover the cost of the local police operations]].

==An Hero==
Faggot ended up becoming [http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=606851 an hero] possibly to avoid jail rape for having bans on his hard drive. Fgt should have skipped the post and saved $100,000 by becoming an hero the day before. One in the head saves 100k in the pocket.
