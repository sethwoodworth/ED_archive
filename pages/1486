'''Jack Chick''' is what happens when a comic book artist becomes a Christian [[fundamentalist]]. A typical Chick tract will usually feature a person who has yet to be "saved" or will be tricked by another character, who is usually the [[Satan|Devil]] in disguise. The character will eventually return to [[Jesus]], after realizing the error of their ways. Everyone who isn't a Jesus freak goes directly to Hell, or is actively working for the Devil. They're often full of hilarious misinformation about just about fucking everything. Jack Chick tracts are a [[The Sandwich Chef|popular target]] for [[Photoshop]]pers, in part because they are so [[Crazy|batshit insane]]. The inherent problem with [[shoop|shooping]] a Chick Tract is that the original untouched comics are usually the pinnacle of lulz and therefore cannot be improved upon.
