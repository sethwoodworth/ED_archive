'''Caveatipse''' (aka. Depressionman, Indy The Great, Emma Watson's toilet slave (his words not ours)) is an impoverished [[bum|layabout]] who believes that his idiotic posts on the [[Internet]] are worth reading. He likes to pitch himself as the "[[Unwarranted self-importance|third greatest troll]]" based on his tired schtick; this is despite being trolled himself numerous times.

Matthew pretends to be all sorts of things, from a [[Bullshit|ghost hunter]] to a linguist to an heir to a fortune. Everything he says and does is solely meant to promote himself. He has been called to the carpet numerous times for lying and half-truths; when he is caught in a lie, he merely calls the accuser a "stalker" and demands that everybody come to his aid.

==Tinychan==

[[Tinychan]] is the first clone of [[AnonTalk]], founded by Jan Martin after he was unmade as an [[AnonTalk]] moderator. The board went through a few different phases before Matthew found the board in late 2009.

Going by the handle ''Indy The Great'', and [[lie|claiming to be from]] [[France]], Miller proceeded to become known for his constant drunken [[Shit|shitposting]] and willingness to [[camwhore]], as well as making outrageous claims that he would have [[AnonTalk]] taken down and [[Kimmo Alm]] on the run from [[Partyvan|the law]] within 6 months with some kind of a [[fake|secret]], [[i|/i/]] style campaign called "Operation Kimmophile," later renamed to "Operation Gunlimmo." Over a year later, [[AnonTalk]] is still up and [[Kimmo]] is still up to his usual faggotry.

After [[Tinychan]] was switched over to [[4chan]]'s servers, he changed his name to '''Depressionman !qeK7ilt6gI''' (tripcode: "mytripcode"), but also posted under the names '''Bill Cosby''' and '''Sharice Turnipseed !pdO.BiWpeg''' (tripcode: "#ryane").

In early 2010, with a number of the users complaining about his constant posting of drivel and numerous arguments with even the most lenient of the moderation staff, one of the moderators decided to begin [[B&|banning him on sight]]. Once word of this got out, Matthew hit a pitch-perfect note playing the victim card and gathered enough support to move over to a similar board, [[Minichan]].

These days, Matt Miller is a "permaban on sight" on Tinychan. Ltamake hates Miller so much that when someone posts Matt's dox on Tinychan, he'll leave them up. This usually leads to lulz such as DMCAs from Matt and spam attacks.

==Birth of Minichan==
[[File:DMFatfuck.jpg|thumb|This is the obligatory reply to any topic DM makes on Minichan.]]

[[Minichan BBS|Minichan]] is another AnusTalk shithole clone; it began with a number of [[butthurt]] [[attention whores]] from the old tiny4chan kept getting banned. After a user named [[faggot|ninjj]] was banned by Jan he rallied all the [[tripfags]] into leaving [[Tinychan]] for [[Minichan BBS|Minichan]]. 

It has since matured into it's own [[hugbox|unique board]], with Miller posting [[over 9000|over 90%]] of the boards [[shit|content]]. 

Miller currently posts here and constantly shits out posts about cooking, being an [[Apple]] [[fanboi]] and the [[shitpost|digestive functions of women]].

==Matt's Excessive Camwhoring==
Matt Miller posts thousands of images of himself, his apartment, the view from his balcony, his toilet, and his collection of expensive ghost hunting equipment.

He has so thoroughly documented his life and surroundings that even a [[ChadSyphrett|chimpanzee with Asperger's syndrome who just escaped from the zoo]] would be able to [[dox]] him. This greatly feeds into his [[paranoid]] notion that he is being obsessively stalked. By posting one of the below images, you will send Matt into a fit of [[rage]] as he will have forgotten having taken the picture himself and will rightly assume that you are his devoted stalker for life.

==LAGHOUL==

GHOUL, is Matt's ghost hunting and [[fake|paranormal]] site was started by Miller amongst a flurry of pleas for help with web development. Miller launched it along with an ATBBS style forum, bringing several [[faggots|members]] of the [[Minichan BBS|Minichan]] community over as [[moderators]].

[[File:Fog.jpg|thumb|An example of Depressionman's literary skills.]]
Recently, Miller's excursion into the paranormal, and his flailing attempts to garner something of an Internet presence, have hit a snag. After a few tries to present himself as someone with a genuine interest in the paranormal, a big deal was made of Miller's attempts to pass off photographs taken from elsewhere on the web as his own ghost photographs. This followed a previous attempt to pass off long exposure photographs taken by Miller himself as paranormal phenomenon. A number of his stories [http://minichan.org/topic/15889  were called out as lies], and his web of excuses gradually collapsed backward upon him.

At this point, Miller is remaining mostly quiet on the subject ghost hunting. His GHOUL site has sat mostly quiet as late, a toy cast away by a [[Chris-chan|manchild]] no longer interested in being associated with the lies and embarrassing false hopes it represents. Since his latest attempts to garner attention by pleading for money and hyping fake ghost stories has had to be put on hold for the moment, Miller has returned to the tried and true methods used before. Aside from his sporadic attempts to cast himself as the victim of a smear campaign, he has recently been seen on [[Minichan BBS|Minichan]] asking questions about gaming computers and posting snippets of puerile prose involving fog.

==Pre-Tiny/Minichan==
More background. Miller's [[scat|fecal]] obsession is nothing new. He has used it to great effect in getting attention before, and he relies on the shock value to gain attention. In late 2007, a series of posts were made to anonyblog.com that trace back to Miller:

<pre>"It was just a little thing I did with the Kodybear. It is no big deal."
Indy the Great is bathing in a giant vat of teenage girlturds (pronounced as one word) 
when Halifax enters the room. Halifax the Bi-Curious Necromancer and Manservant vomits 
explosively for five minutes, puts on a hazardous materials suit, then enters.
"Ugh. Lord Indy?"
"Yes, yes? What do you want? I am bathing?"
"So I smell. It seems, Lord, that the Kodybear and the Magogo have foiled our plan."
"WHAT? How?"
"They have given the earth a colostomy and rerouted the Taco-Bell-Shit (pronounced as 
one word) to Ricky Finklestein's trailer."
"Hmm. You know, even I have to admit, that is ingenious. How can I fight against so 
brilliant a plan? I say, on just this one issue, that we join forces with the Kodybear 
and keep force-feeding (pronounced as one word) Taco-Bell (p.ronounced as one word) to 
Mother Gaia. By the way, how are our Taco-Bell (pronounced as one word) stocks doing?"
"We have netted 190 trillion dollars, Master."
"Wonderful!"
"But, the Kodybear and the Magogo have been training monkey warriors, and they are 
coming to reclaim the TurdKave. Apparently, they have kannons filled with muriatic acid
 to dissolve bone."
"Curses! We are foiled! The only option is to abandon the TurdKave and retreat to the 
Turdstar. Are the girlturd spaceships ready?"
"Ready."
"Then leave the skeleta here to fight against the bear and the monkey. Maybe they will 
at least kill a few million Magogoi (correct Greek plural). Until then, are my Afrikan 
negroidal slaves standing ready on the Turdstar?"
"Yes, Master."
"Then what are we waiting for?"
In the dead of the night, a sparkle of light emits from the TurdKave. A spaceship, made 
of gi.rlturds (p.ronounced as one word) and shaped like a turd, shoots out. Several hours 
later, it reaches the Turdstar - an exact replica of Darth Vader's Deathstar. But where 
the giant hole for the laser gun was, there is a giant gi.rlanus (p.ronounced as one word). 
Inside is a giant turd, 4 times bigger than earth itself. INDY THE GREAT sets himself up 
in the captain-chair (pro.nounced as one word), and the Turdstar becomes fully functional.
"Shall we blast the bear, the monkey, and the Vapor?"
"Not yet, Halifax. Not yet. First, I want to kidnap the monkey. Send in Resurrected 
Manservant Leroy Cleophus Washington. He is now undead, so he cannot be killed. I want 
him to kidnap the Magogo."
"Yes, Lord."
INDY THE GREAT puts on a Darth Turdor mask and begins to breath heavily like Darth Vader. 
He begins his turd training in The Fart, his version of The Force, and waits to see what 
unfold in the Great Battle of the Turdkave (all prono.unced as one word).</pre>

This kind of attention seeking behavior is typical of Miller; For him, there is no negative attention. A response is a response, whether it is amused support, sympathy, or death threats. Once people have acknowledged his presence he will do anything to remain relevant. 

He spent a number of months trolling the [http://yarisworld.com YarisWorld] forum under the name "Caveatipse". <s>Trying to register an account on that forum using the name "Caveatipse" will result in an automatic permanent IP ban.</s> [[DTISC|No, it doesn't]].

=="Stalking"==
[[file:I bet Sk did this.png|thumb]]
Matt constantly whines about being "stalked" online. He has posted several long rants about receiving death threats and having his personal life impacted by invasions into his email and online accounts. Small portions of this are no doubt true, as Miller has collected as many irate followers as sympathetic fans. This is Miller playing the [[Victim complex|victim card]] to great effect again and blowing a small amount of truth out of proportion.

Matt Miller believes that he is being stalked by a [[hacker]] named [[script kiddie|sK]] and some guy named [[why.jpg|JAmes MAthews]] (yes that's how he spells it). Back in the late spring of 2009, [[samefag|2 anons who took the names UltimateCake and sK]] started a board called Depressionman BBS. It was originally a reasonably harmless [[griefing]] operation geared towards [[phishing]] [[tripcode|tripcodes]]. However,  Tinychan mod Nickalollyoff was dumb enough to [[asking for it|use the same password for his tripcode ''and'' his Tinychan mod account]]. sK logged onto Tinychan with Nickalollyoff's account and proceeded to [[delete fucking everything]]. Some [[tripcode]]s were found, some email passwords were guessed, but these were scattered events done by bored teens on the web, not as part of some devious, collective effort to ruin Matt Miller. Miller [[Asking for it|leads people along]], leaving openings like weak passwords, ''read: poopfart'', for [[forever alone|angry virgins]] to take advantage of easily. Once he hints at the desired outcome enough and someone takes the bait, Miller has a new crisis to talk about. More importantly, he has a new reason to talk about himself.

This is a game that Miller plays all too well, and the [[Victim complex|victim]] persona is played to the hilt. He has already enjoys a bit of online sympathy, playing a role that resembles both the outrageous carnival barker who makes the most outlandish and ridiculous claims and the village idiot, who cannot help but do so.

This latest round of manufactured controversy and obviously false claims is simply Miller's latest attempt to stay relevant. The current crowd has come to view Miller as [[Asperger's syndrome|eccentric]] and harmless, but the interest and outrage have died down too much for him.

Lately, Matt's new "stalker" alias is "Timber Nigger", who apparently made one prank call to Matt before leaving Mini/Tinychan forever. Subtle, Matt.
