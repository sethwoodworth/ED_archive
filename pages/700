Austnet
{{spoiler|[EVERYTHING ON THIS PAGE IS BULLSHIT AND MOST LIKELY INCOMPLETE SO FUCKING FIX IT]}}

AustNet is an IRC network formerly run by Oneyed and RogerY that was built on the unreal ircd base with custom written services code added which makes it good enough for them to call it a new ircd appropriately titled Austhex.

AustNet was the target of a ddos attack by iCER/darkacid but he bragged got owned then went to court and shit but got off quickly making it [[Shit_nobody_cares_about]]. 

In 2007 there was a fight between opers and some cunt /squit most of the servers and formed a new network called AustIRC which has never had more the 50 users in its life. Many dumb AustNet users did not know what to do when this happened as the network was left with only two servers. Many nerds puckered up and offered to help in an effort to get irc pussy and soon there were more servers and connecting issues were over. Realizing that unreal was a shit ircd base, and had been owned with backdoors, AustNet decided to switch to inspircd. 

In a retarded move AustNet decided to cause trouble and give operator access to iCERs best mate Stevie, who runs the servers donut.austnet.org and ataxia.austnet.org. '''only faggots use these servers'''.
Stevie in turn added his [[Redneck]] friend Blackdevil to the operator list, who owns the channel #teens and is a known [[Pedophile]]. This caused a dramatic drop in users falling from [[Over_9000]] to nearly below 1000.

Sometime in 2008 the AustNet homepage and AustNet services help sites were defaced.

With servers located in [[Australia]] and the [[USA]], AustNet is an excellent IRC network to troll. If you get glined, leave it to attempt to reconnect, after a while, you get let in again. Make sure that when you get back in, you retain the same nick and say "Hi guys, I'm back" for maximum annoyance. 
It can also be fun to mass register nicknames on AustNet as they require no email authentication like any real ircd.

Then when advised to take anti-religious discussion elsewhere, I was banned from #christian.

But of course, I was still somewhat thirsty for more:

What the fuck was this then?

Other channels to try: DO A /LIST FAGGOT!

These are pretty [[shitty]] examples from [[faggot]] with a huge [[dick]]. 


Please note trolling the Operators on AustNet is NOT RECOMMENDED as they practice [[Computer_Science_III]] and have unlimited resourses and if you piss them off they will attack you and get your [[Internets]] turned off as shown here:
