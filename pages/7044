'''Roy L. "Rocky" Dennis''' is the main character from an old [[eighties]] film titled "Mask" about a [[sick fuck]] with [[Juliana Wetmore|a very hideous face that should have been aborted long ago.]] He is based on an [[IRL]] freak with the same name and disgusting facial deformation. In the movie, Dennis falls in love with a [[Blindness|blind girl]] (because let's face it, no woman in their right mind would want someone as ugly as he is). When he [[raep|scores]] his dream girl, he gets separated from her and suddenly dies. A similar fate which is bestowed on [[you]], minus the girl of course.

==MASK Comic==
A few months ago, some guy on [[LiveJournal]] named James Harvey shat out a little [[webcomic|comic series]] about the movie MASK. Upon viewing of these comics, one will find they are a [[perverted]] work of art straight from the anus of [[hell]], somehow being both amazing and [[lulzy]]. In it, Rocky begins to discover the [[prostitution|real reason]] why women were created other than being [[in the kitchen]] and becomes a [[pimp]] whoring his former blind love interest. Once an ugly freak around whom no one wanted to be, Rocky begins making quite a name for himself by satisfying all the lonely customers seeking a little [[anal|female attention]].

With his blind girlfriend now just a paperweight to him, Rocky practically becomes a don. From sawing her legs off, to injecting [[drugs|heroin]] into her system, the webcomic seems to get the true moral of [[secks|true love]] more than the movie ever could.

==IRL Rocky(The Ballad of Roy Lee Dennis)==
[[File:Rocky Dennisfamilyguy.jpg|thumb|120px|An [[unfunny]] parody of Rocky from a [[Family Guy|horribly unfunny show.]]]]
Unlike the comics, the movie is based on the [[boring|fascinating]] life of Rocky Dennis, the aforementioned hideous mutant with the [[fucked]] up face. Of course, no one wanted and not even a mother [[DO NOT WANT|could love]] a face like his. Ol' Rocky was born on December 4, 1961 and died when he was still an angsty, depressed 16 year old boy. He was [[fucked|blessed]] with a wonderful rarity that only occurs once out of every 22 million births, so of course his condition was ''special''. But just like Juliana Wetmore, another repulsive freak that is an eye sore, Rocky's mother didn't get an abortion like she should have long ago.

Compounding this mistake, he lived a shitty life like all freaks and got treated like the vermin he was. His brother died from [[AIDS]] (srsly) and Rocky himself wasn't expected to reach [[Maturity|adulthood]] due to his condition. From this cautionary tale, we learn the importance of [[abortion|coathangers]].
