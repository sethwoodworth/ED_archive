CareerBuilder.com
{{boring}}

'''CareerBuilder.com''' is a [[shit]] website where anyone who is [[unemployed]], majored in some liberal arts field like [[Bailout Plan|screwing people over with their retirement plan]] can find a [[job]] easily, provided that they have at least one relative who was a Jew or have mastered [[Scientology|OT 3]].

[[You|The rest of the world]] are shit out of luck.

==Create Profile, Receive Spam==
Because the economy is so fucked up right now, you may think it would be wise to make your resume public on the Internet.  What you will really get is more [[spam|exposure by marketers]] rather than headhunters or employers.

Regardless of what you majored in or what part of the country you are in, you will be asked to do all sorts of shit that you had no interest in applying for, like being a repoman in the next county, a credit card counselor in India, or the bookie in Poland for some Nigerian Prince who wants you to hold on to a piece of his fortune by giving him $500.

Then their is the spam for credit card and loans and drugs from [[Canada]], because the folks at career builder think you are [[emo|depressed]], flaccid, and can afford to purchase a loan or credit card with an interest rate that will likely enslave you for the rest of your life.

==Upload Resume, Apply for Spam==
One of the things that pisses everybody off who uses CareerBuilder are the forms at the top and bottom of nearly every page that try to get you to sign up for something you have no interest what so ever in doing it!

Forms like:
* Do you want to join the Navy?
* How about enroll at [[CSIII|DeVry University]]?
* [[Bullshit|Sanford Brown]]?
* [[Arizona|University of Phoenix]]?
* How about the Army National Guard?
* Come on, click this! You'll get more [[spam|exposure]] for your resume. (see next section)

==Pay the Jews, Recieve More Spam==
Recently, the Jews at CareerBuilder came up with an idea to bilk more money out of the desperately unemployed, the same way that televangelists and Scientology get their lulz: They want [[You|YOU]] to pay [[Jews|THEM]] more money.

If you are on [[welfare|unemployment benefits]], the check the government gives you ain't worth shit, especially if you have bills to pay, kids to feed, and a mortgage.  This is assuming the government doesn't try to block extension of those benefits before they go on a two week break. But hey, [[Hookers and blow|what's an extra $60 out of your pocket going to pay for?]]

Paying them $60 gets you nothing but more of the the same results had you spent that money on [[weed|something more important]].
