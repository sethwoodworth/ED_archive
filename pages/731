'''''Azumanga Daioh''''' is notable in that it features only one male character, who is of course overworked because he has to be a [[pedophile]] ''and'' a [[furry]], and probably more things if he had more screentime.  It is also that rare kind of anime filled with schoolgirls but lacking even one [[pantyshot]], yet [[otaku]]s still smell the scent of vaginas in the air whenever they watch the show, which inevitably causes furious [[masturbation]].

To make up for the lack of [[almost raped|breast groping]] gags, every remaining character is therefore one or more of the following: a [[lesbian]], [[alcohol|a roaring drunkard]], a raging [[pedophile|lolicon]] magnet, a [[plushie]], or just plain [[batshit crazy]].

Although the mangah and anniemay have ended several years ago, series creator Kiyohiko [[Narcissistic personality disorder|Azuma]] decided to revive the series after working on [[404 Girl|Yotsubato!]] the whole time.

==Plot==
It's likely about [[school]] life in [[Japan]], who knows!

No, wait... [[Seinfeld|It's a show about <i>nothing!</i>]]

Or, maybe this video sums up the whole series.

==Characters==
*[[Osaka]] - The character who is spacey and dumber than a bag of door knobs, yet the most revered character as everyone who watches ''Azumanga Daioh'' will always erotically fantasize about Osaka [[at least 100]] times in every episode. 
*Chiyo - Token [[loli]] of the series. You can't have an anime without [[at least 100|at least one]] loli character, [[amirite]]?
*Tomo - Hyperactive and always a [[bitch]] to Yomi.
*Sakaki - Tallest girl of the gang who has an obsession with cats and other [[pain series|cute]] animals resulting in her keen interest in [[bestiality]]. [[Some argue]] that her obsession with cats is the true reason for [[Caturday]], but people still [[shit nobody cares about|don't give a shit]].  
*Yomi - Suspected [[fatass]] through Tomo's eyes. Her jelly-rolls and stockings make her erotic. [[Some argue|However, some people say she is just anorexic.]] She is also the only character with an on-screen nude scene.
*Kagura - The jock of the gang. Her grins may make her the female equivalent to [[Cockmongler]].
*Kaorin - [[Dyke]] who got little screentime throughout the rest of the series. She is fucking gay for Sakaki.  She is constantly stalking and planning to [[rape]] her but always gets too nervous to actually do it.
*Chihiro - Kaorin's friend who was [[Poland|forgotten]] after the third episode.  Her short hair-cut suggests she's a [[lesbian|dyke]] and likely Kaorin's first crush until she saw Sakaki's huge tits. ...Or, maybe her kitty panties...
*Yukari - [[Lie|The best teacher in the world.]] Known to be [[drunk]], a horrible driver and often competitive towards Nyamo, but she did it for the [[lulz]].
*Nyamo - PE teacher who seems to put up with Yukari's lulz-inducing mayhem.
*'''Kimura''' - [[Pedobear]] in human form. He lieks schoolgirls, but later in the series it's revealed [[shit nobody cares about|HE HAS A WIFE AND DAUGHTER!! ZOMG!!!!1]]

==Internets Relevance==
''Azumanga Daioh'' launched a hundred [[memes]] that were old before they were invented.
Seriously, places like [[4chan]] practically hemorrhage [[Photoshopped|shopped]] Osaka and Chiyo pics.

==Rating==
*''Action'': Can't you fucking read?  '''Nothing happens!'''
*''Lulz'': [[Over 9000]] if you're a [[fangirl]]. About .35 if you're a [[Simpsons|Homer Simpson]] to [[anime]].
*''Pedophilia'': [[Chris Hansen|Why don't you take a seat over there]]...
*''Morals'': At least there's no [[Bleach|violence]] or suggested [[Pokemon|slavery]] themes.
*''Overall'': [[Lie|It's better than Lucky Star, so it's got that going for it]]
