'''/co/''' is a board on [[4chan]] where [[anime|cartoons]] and [[manga|comics]] collide. Theoretically, it's supposed to be about the discussion of cartoons and comics, but in reality is used for anon to discuss [[Drawn Sex|animated porn]], whine about their [[Virgin|sex lives]], and circlejerk with [[tripfags|drawfags]]. To their credit, they do attempt at creating [[original content]] more often than most boards, but it's usually just gay 'Music Meister' porn or [[gay|anthropomorphic personifications of the various boards on 4chan]]. /co/mrades, as they refer to themselves, are probably the least harmful [[4chan]] users [[stupid|to meet in real life]]; whilst the others will just [[rage]] at you for not having their opinions, /co/mrades usually at least buy you dinner first before [[A Game of Pretend|asking you to dress up as Neil Gaiman]]. /co/ is also unusually tolerant of [[femanon]]s, unlike its cousin [[v/|/v/]], with whom it has an uneasy relationship.

== History ==
/co/ was created [[At least 100 years ago]] as a refuge for western-style cartoon porn aficionados to go and [[fap]] over pictures of [[Superman|Power Girl]], [[Spiderman|Black Cat]] and [[Deadpool]]. This mass exodus of [[basement dweller]]s has also had the result of making [[a/|/a/]] full of only weeaboos.

== Ways to Troll /co/ ==
While trolling is an art, even the greatest artists must start somewhere. Following the bullets below will help you to begin a solid career in trolling. '''NOTE:''' Sticking around the threads for a while may actually get you interested in [[shit nobody cares about|comix]], so troll carefully.

* Mention Scott Pilgrim. At all.
* Sage or otherwise shit on sharethreads.
* Post unrelated images in storytime threads.
* Praise [[CTRL ALT Delete|Tim Buckley]].
* Praise Liefield's artwork.
* Tell them that you REALLY enjoy the writer Bendis.
* Criticize anything written by Ed Brubaker or Alan Moore.
* Complain about the [[over 9000|four]] different Flashes in the DC Universe.
* Create god-awful [[OTP]] threads.
* Start a drawfag thread without drawing anything.
* Complain about the new Captain America.
* Compare [[Mattmurderface|Joe Murray]] to [[John Kricfalusi|John K.]]
* Mention [[John Kricfalusi|John K.]]
* Bring anything from /a/ to the board. Note: This may fail due to nostalgia-fags
* Start a ''[[Total Drama Island]]'' or ''[[16-year-old girl|6teen]]'' thread. For extra trollage cred, upgrade it to a [[ship]]ping thread.
* Post the [http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v636/JMPTX/thunderdome/Week%2046/Group%20C/HawkPG.jpg image] of Power Girl kissing Hawkman.
* Start a "Who was the better Joker?" thread.
* Ask what the Green Lantern's superpower is.
* Say /co/ is love.
* Mention Maggie at any time,you don't even need a picture, however this is particularly effective in Adventure Time threads. 
* Make fetish-related requests in drawfag threads (scat for bonus points).
* Praise Cartoon Network for moving to "[[IRL|real life"]] programming. Shit will hit the fan and lives will be lost. Have fun with this one!
* Ask why other artists can't draw as realistically as Greg Land does.
* Make a thread about comics and/or cartoons.  The /co/ janitor really hates those.
* /co/ has found a recent love for ''Hey Arnold!'', just find one and say you hate Rhonda and/or that Helga is one-dimensional and boring.
* Discuss [[Dragon Ball Z]] or [[Digimon]].

===Troll copypasta for drawthreads===

====Chun Li/Wonder Woman====
[[File:Chunners.jpg|thumb|right|The accompanying image]]
Ok, this is after a long fight/foreplay, so they're both pretty sweaty and stinky.

Chun Li had this outfit on, but now she's half naked and she has unshaved armpits and legs (because they'd be covered by the outfit), the armpits are very hairy, but the legs aren't incredibly hairy, just average, she's half-Asian anyway. She has sweat stains around her armpits (if the discarded outfit is visible in pic, if not, disregard. She is muscular but also a bit chubby, she has semi-visible upper abs and very meaty legs and thighs. Her lower abs aren't visible, and she has a tiny bit of a lower belly. Typical Asian long pubic hair. Her feet are dirty and stinky (she has one of her boots off).

Wonder Woman is completely naked save for her bracelets and tiara, she is very muscular, and has a lot of armpit stubble (but they're shaved, though not very recently). She also has a hairy bush and an unshaved happy trail. Shaved legs, again with some stubble. Her toes and feet aren't shaved (if she has her boots off). 

Chunners is kneeling around Wonder Woman's torso, pinning her down with her massive thighs. She is displaying her hairy cunt to WW, and pissing all over her tits and face. She has one arm behind her head, and she's in the process of letting her hair hang down (taking off the head dress things), so her hairy armpit is clearly visible. Her other hand is behind her chunky butt, fingerfucking her ass. There is some poop residue on the visible part of her finger and around her anus.

Wonder Woman is lying down on her back in complete bliss, both of her arms raised above her head so her armpits are on display, her wrists tied by her own lasso. She is sniffing and possibly licking one of her armpits. Her large clitoris is erect and throbbing, and she is rubbing herself onto one of Chun Li's discarded boots, which is lying between her legs. There migh be faint poop residue around her mouth suggesting Chunners let her lick her dirty finger.

====Furry/Statue of Liberty====
[[File:Bridgetboots.jpg|thumb|right|Yiff in hell.]]
Bridget from an American Tail wearing nothing but sexy boots, fishnet stockings, and a garter that goes around her waist. She is standing naked on top of the statue of Liberty and waving the Irish flag. Pronounced armpit (possibly pubic and belly) fur and tuft of chest fur would be great. I'm not the original requester, I just really liked the request so I'm pasting it!

Also the original requester posted a link to fuckawesome Western boots she should be wearing but I forgot to save it. I pasted similar boots into the ref image but I'm not sure if they're exactly right.
