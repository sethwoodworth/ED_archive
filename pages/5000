'''''Lucky Star''''', is an [[typical|overrated]] [[animu]] that most of /a/ has been creaming their pants over since its debut in April 2007. Catered to [[pedophiles]], the show follows the completely ordinary lives of "17" (lol) year old high school girls, drawn to resemble eight year olds-- which makes fapping to the bath scene [[Sarcasm|totally okay.]] Whereas the show may have its moments, like Tsukasa being attacked by goats, they're few and far between. Most of the shows are sequences of dialog that last for hours on end, wrapped up with one witty retort when each scene closes. Rinse, lather, repeat. More or less, the show is just a bunch of girls acting like a bunch of girls, which is fascinating to the average [[ronery]] [[otaku]], but to the less pathetic viewer: simply boring. 

It is extremely easy to [[troll]] the shit out of the ''Raki Sutah'' fanbase, as they are the figurine-collecting, futon-lounging, hentai-ogling otakus who most likely own at least one of those creepy pillows with an anime girl printed on it, and they honestly have nothing better to do than defend the show containing their imaginary girlfriends. 

The only three reasons [[weeaboos]] like this waste of internets is because (A) the show has animu references pouring out the ass, (2) the characters' ASPECT RATIO (they're 17 years old but look 7), and (D) each girl's personality is designed to appeal specifically to the ronery otaku. None of which make up for the fact that the show is [[unfunny|less funny]] than [[Chuck Norris]] facts.

==Plot==
''Lucky Star'' follows the lives of a group of high-school girls from their freshman to senior year (junior to senior in the case of some). Most of the show consists of the protagonists, especially Konata, being [[unfunny]], referring to other [[anime|animes]], and being [[lesbian|fags]]. Every episode basically shows 30 minutes of the girls [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[shit_nobody_cares_about|talking]], and [[vagoo|OMG IT'S SO STINKY!]], and looking "[[goatse|cute]]". About the only reason anyone sits through this [[shit]] is to [[troll]] and have something else to base their [[yuri]] fantasies on. Or rape, if you're a [[sick fuck|pedo]].

In summary, ''Lucky Shit'' is an enormous cock-tease for [[you|sad otakus]] and provides no real plot and a script that a down syndrome child could create.

==[[Lolicon|Lolis]]==
[[Image:Kagamin.png|thumb|150px|Kagami. Yaoifan.]]
'''Konata Izumi'''
<br/>Konata is an OMGSOKAWAII!!! [[Basement dweller|Basement-dwelling]] [[otaku]], and main character in the series. She fucks away most of her time playing H-games, fapping to [[CP|Yuri]], poking fun at [[oxymoron|superior animes]], and huffing paint (This is why she always has that retarded expression). She exists primarily as a device for Jew to insert as many [[Haruhi]] references as humanly possible and more. (Of course, the fantards and [[Wapanese|weaboos]] who watch it would probably still [[Faggot|suck KyoAni's dick]] even if it were 100% references. ZOMG CODE GEASS! ZOMG MARIMITE! etc.)

She has [[Loli|no tits]]. She is also a [[Lesbian|fag]].

Also is probably [[fat]] [[IRL]].
<br/><br/>
[[Image:Tsukasa.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The typical scene in ''Lucky Star'' when Tsukasa takes her first look at [[lemonparty]] on her cell phone.]]

'''Kagami Hiiragi'''
<br/>[[Bitch|Tsundere]], and second most talkative character in the series. Kagami is a [[nerd|hard worker]]. She is also [[religious]]. Bitches constantly throughout the show because Konata copies her homework even though she lets her do it, leading us as viewers to believe she is [[Lesbian|gay]] for her friend. Also bitches about her weight, which is [[over 9000]].

She has [[tits]], though in the [[pedo]]style of Kagami Yoshimizu, they are never drawn.
<br/><br/>

[[Image:Miyuki.jpg|thumb|200px|Miyuki, the trap oldfag.]]
'''Tsukasa Hiiragi'''
<br/>Kagami's twin sister. Like Konata, she copies off Kagami, who bitches about this less because Tsukasa is [[Retarded|special]]. She is made fun of a lot, but is usually too stupid to be offended and laughs at herself instead.

She also has invisible tits.
<br/><br/>

[[Image:Yutaka.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Yutaka being [[unfunny]] in the classroom.]]
[[Image:Minami.png|thumb|150px|Minami (almost) exposing her flat chest to the world.]]
'''Miyuki Takara'''
<br/>Possibly the only not-quite-loli character in the series (adults excluded), Miyuki is called a protagonist, but really she exists only to provide a pair of [[tits]] (to reassure you the show isn't just for [[sick fuck|pedos]] - it doesn't work). Secondarily, she exists to provide [[tl;dr]] explanations of things like [[shit nobody cares about|why hair loses its color under sunlight]] which the characters are wondering about when they could actually be doing shit and being [[funny]].

She's also fucking [[Money|rich]].
<br/><br/>

'''Yutaka Kobayakawa'''
<br/>Yet another [[pedo]]bait, [[Kawaii|moe]], titless character in the series, because KyoAni and Kagami Yoshimizu honestly think that [[Not This Shit Again|too much is never enough]]. She is even shorter than Konata, and has even less tits. Lived with Cousin Yui before moving in with Konadad and daughter. She calls Konata "onee-chan" despite the facts that Kona is - one, not her sister, two, two years her senior, and three, probably smarter even though she's a basement-dwelling fag.
<br/><br/>

[[Image:Misao.png|thumb|150px|left|Misao uttering her catchphrase. Translated, 'I suck cock!']]
[[Image:Ayano.png|thumb|150px|Ayano.]] 
'''Minami Iwasaki'''
<br/>Doesn't talk much. Keeps mostly to herself, probably only interacts with Yutaka because she's [[kawaii|cute]]. That doesn't stop them from being [[gay]] for each other.

Basically [[Azumanga Daioh|Sakaki]], with shorter hair and no tits.

She is also fucking rich.
<br/><br/>

'''Misao Kusakabe'''
<br/>Bastard child of [[Azumanga Daioh|Tomo and Kagura]], and maybe [[Bestiality|Tadakichi-san]] (note the enhanced left canine). She is athletic, and like most athletes, also [[retarded]]. In a few years, she'll probably be making millions and pulling awesome benders. Or maybe just the last one.
<br/><br/>

'''Ayano Minegishi'''
<br/>Misao's friend, looks out for her. Not much to say, but she bakes a mean [[Marijuana|weed]] cookie.
<br/><br/>
[[Image:LuckyStarPatriciaHiyori.png|thumb|200px|left|Geeks.]]
'''Patricia Martin'''
<br/>Gaijan transfer student from the [[United States|US]]. A [[Wapanese|weaboo]] faggot, she learned Japanese from [[anime]] and [[manga]], which is why when she's saying hi to Kona and friends they think she's asking them if they're [[gay]] (which is a valid question since they are, but still [[retarded]]). Only purpose in the series is to give fucktarded [[wapanese|weeaboos]] [[unrealistic expectations]] about being [[lie|accepted]] in Japan.
<br/><br/>

'''Hiyori Tamura'''
<br/>Doujin artist. Draws shit ranging from guys getting it [[in the ass]] to [[Cunnilingus|cuntmunching]] [[lesbians]].
<br/>[[Image:Gheyfgt.jpg|thumb]]
[[Image:Lucky-channel.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The usual [[lies|unfunny]] ''Lucky Shit''.]]<br/>

'''Akira Kogami'''
<br/>Junior high student and self-proclaimed idol and captain of ''Lucky Channel'', the three-minute bit that runs at the end of every episode. She almost always starts off every ''Lucky Channel'' cute and chipper and [[asking for it]], then degenerating into a total fucking [[bitch]] whenever Minoru introduces himself, meaning that about 2 minutes and 50 seconds of every episode are dedicated to Akira bitching her stupid yandere ass off. STFU, GO GET RAPED ASSHOLE LOLI
<br/><br/>
Essentially, her entire existence on the show is to be the anime embodiment of a [[forced meme]] as she constantly tries to bitch and whine about not being in the show and beg the audience members like an [[moot|internet celebrity]] to convince the staff to give her actual screen time. Since [[Fellatio|sucking their cocks]] obviously didn't work.
<br/><br/>

'''Minoru Shiriashi'''
<br/>High school student in the same high school as Kona and friends, appearing as 'Sebastian' in the show; he is also the assistant on the ''Lucky Channel'' bit, and sang karaoke for the ED of four episodes (wa-wa-wa-wasuremono~). Akira, who seems threatened by his very presence on the show, bitches at him constantly. That doesn't make him not a [[faggot]], wearing twin doriru on his head in an early episode, and wearing a gay blonde sunflower wig [[IRL]]. Minoru Shiraishi's voice actor is Minoru Shiraishi. IRL, he is waging war on [[The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya|Haruhiism]].

==[[Pedophiles|Adults]]==
[[Image:Nanakonafapsession.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Nanako and Konata [[Camwhores|get it on]] [[OL]].]]
'''Nanako Kuroi'''
<br/>Homeroom and history teacher, and also a [[basement-dweller]]. Nanako wastes time [[OL]] with Konata at night playing ''[[Warcraft]]'' and [[Masturbation|flicking her bead]] to webcam of her student's JB cunt on MSN. [[Srsly]]. She's unmarried, and sometimes hits on Yui because she doesn't know the bitch is already taken.
<br/><br/>
[[Image:Yui.gif|thumb|right|Yui "Moeblob" Narumi, being retarded.]]
'''Yui Narumi'''
<br/>Konata's cousin. Despite being a [[FBI|police officer]] she is a completely [[retarded]] blob of moe like the teenagers. Sometimes they even play dating sims, although this annoys Konata out of fear she's going to get [[V&]]. Yui frequently comes to Konata's house completely [[Alcohol|wasted]], and while drunk does stupid shit like sliding around on some shitty Japanese chair. She has a husband, [[an hero|but he's nowhere to be found.]]
<br/><br/>
'''Kiyotaka Narumi'''
<br/>Yui's [[Poland|forgotten]] husband.
<br/><br/>
[[Image:LuckyStar-Sojiro.png|thumb|200pix|left|Soujiro.]]
[[Image:Meito_Anisawa.jpg|thumb|100pix|Meito Anisawa after getting jizzed in the eye]]
[[Image:Ghostmum.png|thumb|200pix|left|Kanata (left).]]
'''Soujiro Izumi'''
<br/>The [[basement-dwelling]] [[otaku]] faggot Konata calls her dad; he is also the equivalent of [[Azumanga Daioh|Kimura-sensei]] as far as personality goes in this series and, thus, a gigantic pedophile. He has a [[Xbox|hueg]] camera that he takes with him to local events so he can snap shots of titless Lolitas and post them on [[2chan]]'s /b/. He is responsible for Konata's gheyness and infatuation with pr0n, having read shitty yuri doujins to his daughter since she was 5. ([[ZOMG]]!)
<br/><br/>
'''Kanata Izumi'''
<br/>Soujiro's [[shit nobody cares about|forgotten]] wife. She is a [[Dead Friend|ghost]]. She also looks about as young as her daughter, despite being [[at least 100|at least 20]] years old. When Soujiro and Kanata initiated the [[sex|dance routine]], it must have looked like [[loli|awesome shit]].
<br/><br/>
'''The Hiiragi Family'''
<br/>Too many lolis to name. Hawt.
<br/><br/>
'''Yukari Takara'''
<br/>Miyuki's mom. A [[dumbass]].
<br/><br/>
'''Meito Anisawa'''
<br/>The dumb fuck who works at the Animate store who's always trying to sell Konata worthless anime shit that she never buys from Animate. I'm going to sleep now.
