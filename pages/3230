[[Image:GarfieldMasterbating.jpg|frame|Then one day, Garfield discovered one of the sad facts of life. [[Masturbation]].]]

'''Garfield''' is the name of:

*'''''Garfield''''' by [[White|Jim Davis]], a chronically [http://www.garfield.com/comics/comics_todays.html unfunny comic strip.]
*'''''Garfield: The Movie''''', directed by [[white|Peter Hewlett]], a [http://www.foxhome.com/garfieldthemovie/ completely unfunny movie.]
*'''''Garfield and Friends''''', an [http://www.povonline.com/Garf%20Episodes.htm unfunny Saturday morning cartoon show] for [[kids]].
*'''James A. Garfield''', a chronically unfunny [[President]] of the [[United States]]. [http://www.wondermark.com/d/189.html]

The comic strip, movie, and television show are all about a [[fat]] [[Italian|lasagna-crazed]] [[cat|pu55y]]. The plot never thickens. Due to its extremely high level of [[unfunny]], ''[[Garfield]]'' is a frequent target of [[Photoshop]]pers. [[Some argue|Some believe]] Garfield is a rehash of "A Christmas Carol" with Garfield as Scrooge and Nermal as Tiny Tim.

The comic itself is about 33 years old (up to date - 2011). It's birthdays are celebrated every year in Davis's stories, yet [[that fucking cat]] doesn't want to die anyway. [[Some argue]] that this is a proof of Garfield's superpowers, although in fact it's only one of many [[Science|scientifically proven]] idiotic ways of ticking the day off for an author. Just like other classical [[unfunny|hilarious]] jokes like "I hate mondays", "Where is my fuckin' food" or "Kill a Spider Week" etc. 

Below is a list of a [[copypasta|typical Garfield jokes]]:

* [[Masturbation|Garfield loves himself]].
* Garfield hates mondays.
* [[Hambeast|Garfield is eating]].
* [[Too lazy|Garfield is sleeping]].
* [[False|Garfield is cynical]].
* Garfield is killing spiders.
* Garfield is watching TV.
* Garfield is drinking coffee. 
* Garfield is not chasing mouses.
* Garfield is trying to do performance on a fence.
* Garfield is screwing over [[Fag|Jon]] / [[retard|Odie]] / [[faggot|Nermal]] / [[Emo|mailman]].
* Garfield is screwed by a [[Lol wat|talking bathroom scales]].
* Garfield is dating [[whore|Arlene]].
* Garfield is stuck in a tree.
* [[Schizophrenia|Garfield is speaking with a teddy bear]]. 
* Garfield is travelling to some rathole.
* Jon is trying to get laid.

Lorenzo Music (AKA: voice actor of Garfield) doesn't suck by proxy. He in fact, <s>owns</s> [[dead|owned]].


==GarfieldTools (comic strip creator)==
<b>GarfieldTools</b>, the ''Garfield'' comic strip creator, is used to create [[lulz|funny and inappropriate]] automatically generated comic strips using the Garfield art and allowing a user to insert their own text. [http://www.dougshaw.com/garfield.html It is available here.]

[[Image:Garfshit.gif|frame|center|[http://www.garfield.com/fungames/comiccreator.html Create some strips!]]]
[[Image:Garfield_suicide.png|frame|center|No, Garfield, you have to suicide with [[The Great Sonic-cide of 2007|bricks and knives]], not imaginary ropes.]]

==Traditional or typical GarfieldTools conceits==
* Garfield can <i>go crazy-eyed,</i> and has the power to <i>make Jon go crazy-eyed.</i> Sometimes he does this in order to make Jon into his [[slave]], but mostly to make Jon [[STFU]]:
[[Image:Garfieldeyes4up1.jpg|frame|center|Garfield makes Jon go crazy-eyed for asking stupid questions while he's eating.]]
[[Image:Garfieldeyes.GIF|frame|center]]

* Usually when Garfield doesn't say anything, <i>Vulgar Jon</i> makes up for it by being even more creepily [[furry|perverted]] than he already was:
[[Image:My3rdgarfieldedityz6.jpg|frame|center|Oh, how typical.]]

* <i>Garbuckle</i> or <i>Garfield-Jon</i> exists in a state of [[shit no one cares about|superposition]], like the homeless [[Hippy#Jerry_Garcia|Jerry Garcia]]-[[dog]] [[Uogamers:_hybrid|hybrid]] from <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</i> This is more likely part of Jon and/or Garfield's terrified realization that [[Fight Club|one is obviously hallucinating the other]]:

[[Image:Jonfacerv6.jpg|frame|center|Who is Jon? Does Garfield exist?]]


[[Image:Official_Garbuckle_081027.gif|frame|center|OMG IT'S AN OFFICIAL GARBUCKLE!!1]]
This also confirms that Garfield is a [[faggot]] popper user.

==MS Paint Time==
Another method of making ''Garfield'' [[funny]] is simply editing Garfield out, thus making Jon look like a crazy fuck.
[http://www.garfield.com/comics/comics_archives.html Go Crazy.]
One fellow [http://www.truthandbeautybombs.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=4997 started by editing out only Garfield's thought bubbles], making Garfield act more like a "normal" cat. Another went further, [http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/ edited out Garfield ''entirely''], and actually [[what|published a book about it]]. [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345513878/?tag=garfield02-20 what the fuck]?

===Garfield minus Arbuckle===
Not quite as [[lulz]] worthy, but still [http://garfieldminusarbuckle.blogspot.com funny]:
[[Image:Garfield_insane.gif|frame|center]]

===Garfield minus Garfield minus Jon===
Taken one step further:
[[Image:Gmgmj1.gif|frame|center]]

===Garfield Minus Garfield Minus Jon Minus [[Bleach|Backgrounds]]===
And to the [[final solution|logical extreme]]
[[Image:Garfield_Minus_Garfield_Minus_Jon_Minus_Backgrounds.png|frame|center]]

===Garfield minus Garfield plus [[LAZOR|Shoop Da Woop]]===
