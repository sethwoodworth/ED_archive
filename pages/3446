Gossiprocks
'''Gossiprocks''' is a gossip forum filled with old, menopausal bitches who are probably ugly and have no lives. Occasionally, there might be a few [[16 year old girls]] and [[gay]] guys that post there too, but most of the kiddies got driven away by the crankiness of old and smelly vagina. They claim they have lives IRL, but so far, there is no proof of that due to the [http://www.gossiprocks.com/forum/latest-gossip/ hundreds of pages] they've built up on with pointless celebrity babble.

== Bitter Jealous Fatties ==
Since having one board isn't enough for these arrogant twats, they had [http://bitterjealousfatties.yuku.com/ another one] accurately named after them. Due to the [[e-drama]] the bitches have endured, this board isn't as active as it used to be [[at least 100 years ago]]. Created from some gay guy, almost all the faghags went towards Gossiprocks and started doing damage over there. This still hasn't prevented the [[trolls]] from creating massive [[lulz]] to their precious old-lady community. Some well-known trolls include:
<p>'''Lolijume:''' [http://www.gossiprocks.com/forum/high-school/97339-can-we-talk-about-lolijume.html Got a whole thread dedicated to her]</p>
<p>'''Femmefatale:''' The [[fat|High Priestess]] of all Had herpes and the [[lie|most perfect life]]. Evar. Created a [[meme|most lasting impression]]</p>
<p>'''Sandcastles:''' Was a mediocre story-teller, providing the fatties with tales of the life they wish they had. Unfortunately, it was a fake troll from some idiot with another account. Somehow, the mods found out and resulted in [[banhammer]].</p>
<p>'''Yoyanna:''' Talked about weird shit like pubic hair and getting horny over your step-brother.</p>
<p>'''JaylaMaria123:''' A recent troll that also talked about the weirdest shit, like smelling balls and being a [[ugly|semi-decent]] looking person.

There are also some notorious [[circle_jerk|clusterfucks]] that lurk around the board 'til this day. Be warned that they will kill and suck your blood for the eternal youth they've been longing for.
