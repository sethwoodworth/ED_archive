==Calgary, Alberta==

*NOTE* The church of scientology owns a piece of land on 14th Avenue and 6th Street S.W. It is a large building located on a park. Perhaps this will be a good place to meet and take some pictures as it is a frequented part of town in the center of the beltline.

CALGARY CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY-Feb 10th 2008-Time TBD
:824C Edmonton Tr NE
:May relocate if inclement weather continues.  Epic Cold=Epic Fail

* Anon wondering where relocation is going to be held if epic fail weather continues. E-mail: young-mensans@shaw.ca

* All comers should have some sort of face mask, there should be some flyers at the event, but if any more can be brought they've got some over at [http://partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology partyvan.info]. We will be gathering at 6th Street near the LRT and we can travel by transit or people can drive if we're able to find an overflow parking or other nearby lot. We'll be aligning with the global raids on February 10 around 11 AM. The operation is still in infancy, so more details will come out as they're available. Email calgarycosraid@gmail.com for faster updates.

* Anon would be well advised to confirm the existence of a Co$ in Calgary in the first place. A quick google search of the location shows that a tattoo shop exists at the given address, and suggests that no Co$ has existed in Calgary for quite some time. Tattoo parlors come and go regularly, and all evidence suggests scifags haven't had an easy time getting set up here, so its possible one of the two recently flopped and gave way to the other. Either way, the location is somewhat remote and unlikely to draw attention. Anon suggests there would be moar epic win in a protest at Olympic plaza across from city hall (poster the c-train lines).

After an intelligence gathering mission, it would indicate that the Church of $cientology no longer operates in Calgary.  This is fairly encouraging news, however we should still hold a campaign to spread the word.  The details are below:

What: Leafleting Campaign<br>
When: Feb 10 (more days if able) 11:00 to approx. 14:00 (2PM)<br>
Where: Major Areas (LRT Stations, Post secondary campuses, shopping areas, downtown)<br>
Weather should cooperate with us at this point in time, will continue to monitor

Bring digital cameras/camcorders.  Any pics and video we can get will make for epic win.

If at all possible, we should conference on the channel #yyccos on the Rizon IRC network (irc.rizon.net) or visit [http://www.rizon.net www.rizon.net] and use web chat before the campaign in order to ensure total organization.  As has been discussed, we are in the clear as far as the city is concerned so long as we don't block anything or make a huge mess (though feel free to raise a little hell). Though the Co$ may not have a base of operations in Calgary, Anonymous can and must help ensure it remains that way.

Raise your fists and signs, don your masks, prepare your docs and flyers.  This will be a pivotal step in ensuring Calgary is defended against $cientology.  They will expect us. 

Anon suggests wearing a hat and sunglasses, but not masks for handing out leaflets. The chance of actually coming in contact with a scifag are minimal, and its better to look approachable and friendly when explaining to people why we must work to make sure scifags never build additional pylons in Calgary. Anon also suggests mentioning the plight of our /b/rothers in Edmonton fighting against the scifag infestation. Further, if someone can dig deeper to find out if scientology is considered a religion, or if the scifags get tax breaks it would give anon something to raise awareness about, and with any luck take away from those dirty tom cruise lovers.

I haven't seen any planning for the April 12th protest as relates to Calgary, and was wondering if there was any being done. Even if they've truly packed up and left, which seems doubtful, we must support our northern Edmonfag brothers in the Albertan struggle against C$, and ensure it doesn't gain a foothold in our city. I am prepared to bring cake for all (or, for as many as I can afford, at least).

: Bring signs and flyer's if possible
: Do '''not''' come with intent to cause trouble, Peaceful protests. Read the rules!
: Bring cameras and recording equipment if possible
     
'''REMEMBER.''' You have the constitutional right to peaceful public protest and assembly(it is guaranteed by Article 40.6.1.ii and 2 of the revised Irish Constitution of 1937 if you need to look it up). Make sure to let the scientologists know this and tell them they are interfering with your constitutional right if they try to BullBait you. 
At the same time, Co-Operate fully with the Gardaí. 
They do have the right to shut the protest down if it is a danger to public safety or the protest obstructs passage of vehicles or pedestrians 
(Particularly be careful of this because the red LUAS line passes through the street). 
They usually don't have to enforce these, but be prepared. 
Bring cameras and recording equipment if possible

==A couple tips==
*The meetings scheduled with Partyvan's Project_Chanology have been merged with the meetings scheduled here, for added connectivity. If there are mutliple organizers for your area - contact them both.
*Consider omitting the word "Fag" in giant capital letters (a la "NYCFAGS, MIAMIFAGS, LONDONFAGS, ect.), lest those who stumble upon it mistake it for a gathering of homosexuals. It won't exactly appeal to the church groups we're trying to lure in, either.

We don't have enough information around for this raid yet.  This is a major raid that has already gotten the attention of the Scifags.
During the practice raid on 2/02 Scifags meet the anons at a coffee shop down the block BEFORE the actual raid had started. 

We have a sympathedic to our cause copy shop that has agreed to print fliers at the cost of $0.01 per sheet.  This can only be done through one specific individual so if you want your own flier printed at cost; sign up at www.enturbulation.org and participate in Santa Barbara & UCSB SoC raid thread.  We have confirmed 20 anons to show + who ever they bring unrelated to the internet + video documentation. GET MORE INFORMATION OUT THERE.  THIS IS A MAJOR SCIFAG COMMAND BASE LOCATION.

===ST.Louis,MO===
UPDATE, dedicated STL Raid forum:  http://cosstl.lumak.net/

Looking for Anon in the St.Louis area for raid on ST.Louis Church of Scientology.

EMAIL: clanstl.david@gmail.com 
just so I can get a feel for how many are coming. In addition to posting relevant info here, a centered email might hurry things up. (DO NOT USE PRIMARY EMAIL ADDRESS) I don't want to know who you are and releasing private info is retarded. Get a fake gmail account.


Location:      6901 Delmar Boulevard 
University City, MO 63130 

Time: before 10:30am to picket 10:30am service

Meet: Starbucks (a little further down Delmar) at 10:00AM CST

Bring: signs, fliers, disguises*, cameras, as little ID as possible, and anything else that strikes you as a good idea.

Remember, this is not just a anon-specific event. Invite whomever you wish to. Bearing that in mind, remember rules 1 and 2. This is our shit, keep it that way. Make it seem like a normal protest.

~* I will check on the legality of masks in STL, but chances are slim they are legal

Updates and specific plans will come soon.

===Berkeley, CA===
Essentially we're going to protest at the Berkeley Church on February 10th in accordance with all the other raids. Plan is to take BART or another form of public transport to Shattuck Square, meet up at the Tully's coffeeshop before hand. From there, we move to the actual church where we will PEACEFULLY protest and hand out fliers. All members are advised to carry some means of recording video and are recommended not to wear masks as we don't want to run the risk getting V&. Hats, loose clothing, and facepaint/bandannas are all recommended though. Be extremely prudent with your identification. Reach me at deusexmechanicus@yahoo.com for any further info.

Church dox: 
63 Shattuck sq
Berkeley, CA 94704
(510) 540-4789

UPDATE: Again, do NOT wear masks. They will get you undue attention from Berkeley's Finest who fucking hate masked people and think they're all anarchists. Don't even go there. The Berkeley cops are on our side on this one so for fuck's sake don't piss them off. Do not block the sidewalk. Leave at least six feet for people to get by. The cops know it's going to happen and are completely cool with it.

Also no megaphones. You need a permit for amplified sound in Berkeley, meaning you need to sign your name and shit.

Someone please make a big motherfucking sign. Like a huge sign.

Our goals in Berkeley should be twofold:
1. Inoculating college students against the Scientlology virus by telling them how fucking dumb it is before they even get approached by a Scientologist, and

2. Getting the Church of Scientology office out of Berkeley. They already left (read: got ran out of town on a rail) during the 80s, and they only came back last year. Now they're back to prey on Cal students. 

Notice how their web address sounds like it's some some historical Spanish mission: www.berkeleymission.org. Registrant is in Berkeley.

===Chicago, IL===
CHICAGO CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY - Feb 10th 2008 @ 11AM CST

:-Gameplan
:Arrive at 11:00 am CST on February 10, 2008.  We are meeting outside of S & G Restaurant, the address of which is below.  Promptness would be appreciated so we can all march on the Scifag HQ en masse.  At S & G we will distribute gear and media and go over the basics of the protest again.  We will have "Hello, my name is" stickers on which you can write your IRC nick, "Anonymous" or whatever.  This is totally optional.  If we have a good number of anon, we will send some (in groups of no less than 2) to nearby intersections and streets to hold signs and pass out fliers to pedestrians.  The rest will do the same outside the HQ.  Grouping off is an optional choice for all anon.

:Concurrently, the Scifags will be holding their Sunday service inside.  When this concludes and Scifags begin to depart, we will call back all anon to HQ.  This will be the most intense moment of the protest.  They will swarm and we will swarm.  They may try to egg you on, yell at you, hit you, etc.  DO NOT ESCALATE THE SITUATION.  Cameras will be rolling.  If you don't feel bold enough to calmly engage them on their brbchurch's horrible practices, simply remain silent or mockingbird everything they say to you.  Keep moving; this ain't Habbo.  Stagnant protests are illegal on sidewalks.  Do not even look like you might be blocking traffic- spread way the fuck out if need be. 

:After this commotion, we will disperse to a wider area and return to signs and fliers.  We will also begin reading dox, playing CDs, videos (if we have them) and starting chants.  This will continue on as long as anon is willing to fight, which means no less than 4 hours, but hopefully more.  The majority will remain centered around HQ.  Coordinators will be attending to wants of groups of anon (if such exist), and you will be given our cell numbers for immediate access.  Even still, you will probably be in eyesight of HQ.  There are a number of food options around the area- we will be happy to make runs for you if you don't want to leave post, but of course, you can fuck off and grub on your own if you please.

:-Attire
:It will probably be mid to high 30s, so warm clothes are a must.  Three-piece suits (not clown suits or furfag suits) are HIGHLY ENCOURAGED, and black suit/tie is preferred.  Dress to make an impact.  Else, a winter gear is fine too.  This is important: wear a hat, scarf, and sunglasses if you're nasty.  If you want to get crazy, wear a wig to attract attention without looking like too much of an asshole.  DO NOT WEAR A V MASK or any other silly mask.  We want to look srs, but Scifags may take your picture.

This is it - Anonymous will be picketing at the heart of the beast, on their home turf. This particular protest is SERIOUS BUSINESS! Park very far away from the protest and/or take public transportation - scientologists and their private investigators will be following anons and taking pictures. They will try to identify us so they can come fuck with us at home. OSA and their thugs will try to start fights with us. Anonymous will remain calm, cool, and collected. The Sci Fags also employed several off duty cops for 45 dollars a hour. (as quoted by xenutv) Please be aware of this.

===Columbus, OH===
COLUMBUS CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY - Feb 10th 2008 @ 11AM EST

:30 North High Street, Columbus, OH 43215
:Meet at Starbucks @ 10 W Broad St #120.  Bring signs and cameras.  Know your shit & Stay cool.

Event flier: [[http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/4/40/ColumbusScientologyRaid.jpg]]

Email: stopxenu@gmail.com

What to bring:
-You should bring signs. Do not say Church of Scientology OR Cult of Scientology, as the first one makes the public sympathize and the second one could get us sued. Just say scientology.

-Memes. Once we get to the church,  memes are strongly discouraged. Keep your memes on the screen. 

-fliers. We need fliers to pass out to the public so that they may be informed about CoS. Search the web, there are plenty, or email me and i can send you some links. Bring extra fliers for those arriving with very little or no fliers at all. 

-warm clothing. Be prepared for the weather, especially if its going to be a longer picket.

-DONT bring any ID. Keep all of you stuff in front pockets as these are harder to pick. Memorize your drivers license number. 

-DONT bring anything that can be interpreted as a weapon. this includes sharp/large sign handles. 

Also, know your material. They know we are coming, so they will probably have some OSA people out there to debate us. I recommend xenu.net and xenutv.com for a quick brush up.

====Police Presence At the Raid====
I have emailed the police about the raid just to clarify the rules. Here is a combination of my email and their response. I will be in contact with the police department at the raid. It is likely that they will send a person to assist us.

Mr. *******

I will in all likelihood be the on scene supervisor for your event. I appreciate you contacting us in advance. let me start out by responding to your questions:

1. Are we allow do wear masks or cover our faces as we protest? Several of our party would prefer their identity remain anonymous.
::There is no city ordnance in Columbus that prohibits you from wearing a mask. However, I notice that this will be a worldwide event. If you plan to also protest in Cincinnati mask's are prohibited in that city.
2. Are we allowed to take video footage/record audio of people on public sidewalks? Do we require their consent?
::You may take video. However, I must warn you that you may be challenged by the person being targeted/videoed and a confrontation may occur.
3. What types of picket signs can we use that couldn't be mistaken for weapons? Are wooden handles allowed, ect?
::Wooden handles are only prohibited when entering an event that has security checkpoints. The police are well aware that wooden handles can be used as weapons and are prepared to take action if they are used in any manner other than what they are intended for.  I would recommend a smaller width handle just large enough to support the sign.
4. Are there any other specific rules we should be aware of as we picket?
::Yes, I have attached a flier that I pass out at large demonstrations/protests/marches.   (I will make this flier available to anyone who wants it. Email stopxenu@gmail.com

The Division respects your right to exercise your first amendment rights.  The amount of police presence is determined by the lawfulness of the group/crowd as well as crowd size. This could amount to a cruiser drive by to monitor periodically or a complete contingent of officers in riot gear. Please think of who you can appoint as informal leaders in your group that can assist you and us if a problem arises.

Parking is near local school within walking distance but out of sight of COS, meet there at 10:30, we will walk to COS after we meet. There are no store nearby so bring food and water. We need a permit, just in case. There are two areas we can stand, one on a sidewalk next to the COS yard and  one across the street. If we stand near the church, do not go into their lawn, and do not block pedestrians. It is unknown to me if masks are allowed, so until further notice, bring them. Bring signs, flyer's, cameras, and anything else helpful. Do not bring anything that could be considered a weapon.

LAS VEGAS CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY- Feb 10th 2008 @ 1 PM  
:846 East Sahara Ave., Las Vegas, NV 89104
:Meet at the nearby Marie Callender's restaurant (600 E. Sahara).
:Since this is going to be in Sin City, we're guaranteed a lot of media attention.  Much lulz will be found.

DRESS CODE: Stay anonymous. Wear a mask of your choosing,or a hoodie that covers your face well. Wear normal clothes,an anonymous costume, or a xenu costume. Bring anti-scientology flyers and pickets. Remember, we are protesting the actions of their organization, not their beliefs. We're not anti-religion, we're anti psycho-cults.

:'''PRO-TIP:''' If you're concerned about the CoS following you after the raid, you might want to consider parking at the Las Vegas Hilton and taking the monorail to the Sahara.  It's not a long walk from the Sahara to the meeting point, especially if you go out the back exit to Paradise Rd.  This gives you plenty of opportunities to ditch anyone who might be following you.

These are the rules for the raid. They must be followed. Please Watch the Video and Listen closely. They will help to ensure much win and minimal loss of hit points.

====Orlando Event Map====
[[Image:scifagmap.jpg]]

====Recommended Reading====
-'''Florida and Orlando State Laws'''<br />
Leave all weapons of any kind at home. This is a peaceful protest. Objects which someone could "mistake" for a weapon are also a bad idea to bring.
<br />Wearing [http://tinyurl.com/yvtve9 masks] in Orlando is illegal. The cops WILL come down on you for this.  Large sunglasses, wigs, and hats are safe.
<br />Remember that this protest is about the actions of Scientology. We are not here to harass their beliefs or mythos.
<br />Remember Lisa McPherson. The 2/10/2008 protests are in her honor.
<br />Bring and hand out as many fliers as you can. Suggested fliers are found [http://www.whyaretheydead.net/mirror/xenu.ca/pickets/leaflets.html here].
<br />Make any large signs out of soft materials such as cardboard and note or poster board.  Long metal or wooden handles are considered weapons.
<br />No alcohol or drugs are allowed.  We will not remain anonymous if we're arrested.
<br />Music can be played (boom-boxes preferred)at a moderate level of sound.  This will be moderated by 'megaphone'. Rule of thumb: if it sounds loud from two two car lengths away then the scifags can trap the police with their own statutes.
<br /> More Florida laws can be read about [http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=View%20Statutes&Submenu=1&Tab=statutes&CFID=39325787&CFTOKEN=11015538 here.]
<br />Remember scifags like to cause trouble while pretending to be with your group.
<br />Remember the Stand Your Ground policy, it's useless to our cause but they can use it as free license to attack anyone "threatening" to them.

-'''Clothing'''<br />
Wear casual clothing.  Baggy jeans and a tee-shirt or button up shirt are recommended.
<br />If you wear any form of identifying clothing please wear clothing which resembles the headless-suit or green-face Anonymous images.
<br />Please wear large, reflective sunglasses and a hat or wig.  Cowboy hats work well for hiding your face.
<br />Hoods ARE a banned item along with masks, but facepaint is just as obscuring and quite legal.
<br />Remember to cover up any distinctive marks, tattoos, scars, or unique personal features.
<br />Keep all wallets or identification in front pockets, they're much harder to steal that way.
<br />Bring a change of clothing or towel in case they turn the sprinklers on again.

-'''Supplies'''<br />
Bring fliers from [http://www.whyaretheydead.net/mirror/xenu.ca/pickets/leaflets.html here] or make your own. We must focus on their crimes and not on their beliefs or myths. 
<br />Bring boom-boxes. If it's loud from two car-lengths away then it's too loud. Suggested music: Anything retro, rickroll, whatwhat, chocolate rain, little girls. Avoid pirated music, the scifags may decide to try and get the MAFIAA involved.
<br />Pack a lunch or bring drinks. A cooler should be fine. Eat things that wont sit heavily in case you need to run.
<br />Cameras and Camcorders are great!  Spy cams and recorders are good choices, small and easy to use.
<br />If you have equipment for a LIVE INTERNETS FEED please bring them.  It would make the most perfect lulz.
<br />

-'''Media'''<br />
Any media or anonymous who is qualified in assisting with the media can contact anon1532@gmail.com.<br />
All videos related to the Orlando raid will be released by anonOtown on youtube.  Distribute openly.<br />
Contact [http://orlando-copwatch.info/ Orlando CopWatch] and let them know about our protest.

Still planning on this one, we have a good number of people willing to do it, but more help is always appreciated. 
Need to check into Pittsburgh's protest laws & mask laws. This one is going to be completely legal and nonviolent. Depending on local laws, we'll either go with masks (V and/or aliens for the lulz!) or wigs/hats/scarves/all that stuff. The CoS here is relatively new, which makes this a good time to strike. 
In addition, there are multiple people in Pittsburgh who are very outspoken against CoS, including a CMU prof and an ex-Sea Org (yes, you read that right). We may try to contact them and either get them to help directly or just get advice. It also might be worth contacting local churches and the like.
We still need:
* ideas - cool/funny/noticeable things to do while raiding
* publicity - posters, etc. for the raid
* a meeting location (could somebody scout the area? or maybe we can just take a look at Google Maps, etc.?)
* more people

NOTE: For some time, the date for this raid was set as February 9th.  This is incorrect.  The raid is occurring on the 10th, with all the others, at 11am.  If you show up on the 9th, you're gonna look like a fucking nutter

ANON UPDATE: I have contacted the Deputy City Clerk Mary Beth Doheny over the phone and she has sent me the city ordinances concerning protests. Masks are allowed. Obstructing pedestrian traffic is not. For more info come to an IRL planning meeting at the Kiva Han on Forbes and Semple on Saturday, February 2nd at 3:00PM. -Anon.

Your right to protest is protected under law. A lawful protest permit application has been filed with the National Park Service and Municipal Police of DC. Please respect all local and federal laws while participating - you are the face and voice of Anonymous.

Hey guys. I <strike>searched through Kansas State Law and Wichita City Law for any mask laws, and came up with nothing. So, it's safe to wear your masks at protest... just don't wear anything.. stupid. I strongly suggest a good, neoprene, face mask. You can breathe through it, and it's going to be FUCKING COLD outside. Just make sure to wear something over your eyes.
[http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?sofocus=bs&sbrftog=1&dfsp=1&catref=C6&from=R10&_trksid=m37&satitle=face+mask+-ski+neoprene&sacat=11450%26catref%3DC6&bs=Search&sargn=-1%26saslc%3D2&sadis=200&fpos=67220&sabfmts=1&saobfmts=insif&ftrt=1&ftrv=1&saprclo=&saprchi=&fsop=1%26fsoo%3D1&fgtp= Some neoprene masks on eBay] Also check out PartyCity on Rock or Kellogg. Mardi Gras is coming soon so they should have something.</strike> [[DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS]]

Okay, apparently this isn't true (though I took the fucking time to search the laws and even the cops couldn't tell me if that was a law in the state of Kansas or the city of Wichita). I can't do this shit by myself, you assholes. If you wanna do this, then post some fucking info on the Facebook group. I feel like I'm the only person doing this shit.

UPDATE: SHITLOAD OF INFO!

1. Local press and media have been notified.

2. Weather forecasts include wind and rain. Be prepared.

3. Police have been notified. There is no permit required to protest.

4. Ability to hand out flyers may be hindered due to city solicitation laws.

5. No excessive noises. Excessive Noises = disruption of religious services = ILLEGAL!

6. Select Anon will be needed for security detail. ENLISTMENT GUARANTEES CITIZENSHIP!

7. Masks, according to KS activist who is organizing this, are not prohibited by law but are discouraged for credibility reasons (so says the organizer). Other means of concealment (hat, scarves, sunglasses,) are encouraged. (Anonymous is at it's own discretion here)


SPECIAL NOTE: Wichita, Kansas, is the spiritual birthplace of Scientology. L. Ron Hubbard lived in Wichita between 1951 to 1952. His addition to Dianetics which has evolved into this scourge called Scientology was thought up in 1952, during LRH's residency.

Therefore, this city should be considered a heavily symbolic target, much in the same matter as Clearwater or Berkeley.

Also, there are UNCONFIRMED reports that local celebrity, Jenny Craig spokesperson, and all-around thundercunt, Kirstie Alley, will be on hand. Kirstie is a Scientologist who heavily funds the center in Wichita. She may orchestrate a counter-demonstrative force to undermine our message and make us as intolerant internet terrorists to the media. We can not allow this. 

Anonymous is scheduled to meet at the College Hill Park on Douglass Ave. at 9:30 AM. 

Anonymous is also encouraged to fulfill their hunger at Spangles. There is no special reason other than that place is pretty fucking awesome and there's about one on each block in Wichita.

We need to keep a 100 foot buffer away from the church to be legal, and we need traffic to be able to pass through.

Peaceful propaganda mission directly in front of (or across from?) the church—fliers, signs ("honk if you disagree with Scientology"), etc. Hate is a strong word, try not to use it in your propaganda. Masks are highly encouraged (Guy Fawkes is ideal) both for anonymity and for effect; a group of a dozen or more all with the same face is a powerful image. It may be best to keep silent, especially with Scifags attempting to bait us. Letting them argue with a wall of silent Fawkeses should be very lulzy.

: Try to keep your propaganda "pro", rather than against.  What we're FOR is freedom of speech, freedom of knowledge, freedom of religion. This will make it harder for them to call us haters or criminal radicals or other such sillies
:Picketing directly in front of the building is legal so long as there is a 1 foot gap between people allowing people to enter and leave the building.
:Police in the Boston MA area are quite lax about protesters so long as they don't cause trouble. Obey Boston Police to avoid v&.
:Also, the sidewalks and side streets (not counting parking lots!) are NOT private property. Should the SciFags try to tell you otherwise, recite your favorite copypasta, and then ignore them.

'''DO''' bring cameras, camcorders and flyers and signs—the more the better.
'''DON'T''' bring obnoxious retards. This isn't about shouting memes.

Scientology HQ on Beacon Street is only two blocks away from Newbury Street.  Their "body routers" (street sales people) are ''always'' at the corner of Hereford Street and Newbury Street giving away free tickets for their ''Orientation'' film or "Stress Test" (the personality test).

The right to wear costumes is protected. ACLU has a handout on how to [http://www.acluga.org/docs/protest.handout.pdf Protest rights].

*New Hampshire sucks. I'll have to come to the Boston raid. Pick a time, and add more info before I email.
::*I think the time is pretty definitely noon, to coincide with the other raids across the country.

===Austin, TX -  11am, February 10th===
====Need Moar Austinites with knowledge of the laws input====
**I will create an anonymous event on facebook once the details are sorted out. As well as a craigslist post. We need to find out the laws about protest, before it becomes too late for any kind of paperwork one might have to fill out.
*We need to know about protest laws, are masks allowed, what kind of photography is allowed.
***(Anon from Portland, OR: Can you call the Texas ACLU?  What about constitutional freedom of assembly--as long as nobody is blocking roads, sidewalks, not causing safety hazard, etc.?)

-i called today and spoke with the city of austin. they said we need to file for an event to use right of way. they need to be filed 60 days in advance or something, and costs about 100 to file the permit. however im going to double check because it seems a little bit much for just a few people down on the sidewalk. 	 
but as for the masks and photography, ill call tomorrow and check as well. 	 
i already started putting up flyers though, you should be able to see them lol

-i set up a facebook group for discussion and spread of information http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=7839963934&ref=mf

2200 Guadalupe St # 2<br/>
Austin, TX 78705<br/>
(512) 474-6631<br/>

--

Set at 11am to ensure lunch/church crowd. Could someone find out the laws for Austin? Masks, wigs, photography(can we photograph strangers), zoning protests, etc? Invite all your friends. At 11am, exactly, everyone walk to the place and begin protesting. Do not park nearby, Scientologists love to follow people home. I believe the UT Towers bells will ring at 11. This should be your cue, if not, just walk over at 11am.
:Silent protest would be great. Signs/flyers, but no talking. This is effective because the Scientologists get all their kicks out of arguing with people.

===New York City, NY: Sunday, February 10, 1:00pm===



Raid / protest of 3 NYC locations is a GO.
* We're a go for TWO raids on Feb 10 @ 1pm. Same MO as the others (quiet and peaceful and en maske, jerks) in , Times Square, and the Celeb Center simultaneously, passing flyers and dox, carrying picket signs? and being quiet and creepy. Anon is working her ass off getting as many civilians as possible- don't ignore all the weirdo liberals in our fair city! Recruit normal human beings, too! We need a leader for the Harlem raid- Email: anyamaus@gmail.com 3rd Party Website: [http://scientology-nyc.weebly.com/ NYC Scientology Raids Site] <<< HARLEM HAS BEEN CANCELED BC HARLEM SUCKS

'''NOTE:''' worried anon here with [http://www.nlgnyc.org/pdf/MaskMemo.pdf a word of caution to mask-wearers]. According to this document, wearing a mask while convening with 3 or more people is against the law. It is only legal if the masks are demonstrably communicative and that the public-at-large will understand its meaning. Furthermore, there must not be a more important governing reasoning for the courts to disallow the masks. I'm not sure how this applies to Anon, considering the symbolism behind the Guy Fawkes mask and its recent use in a blockbuster film, but it's definitely something to consider and something I don't have an answer for. To those with a clearer understanding of this law and how it pertains to us, ''please'' edit this note with more information. Thank you.
<<< Okay, have sought legal counsel- *bring* masks, as 3 at a time may wear masks without running into trouble, but also bring scarves (it's winter, for fuck's sake) sunglasses, hats, etc. Bring your masks anyway. We don't want to push any buttons (moreso than we are) but we can also play it by ear.

'''NOTE:''' Confirmed locations as to where to purchase a Guy Fawkes mask in the city would be greatly appreciated.
<<< Amazon has them for $6 and $12.
<<< The Halloween Adventure Shop has them for something like $11. I bought mine on 1/27 and there were at least a dozen in stock. A dozen is only so many though - we still need more locations.

''NEEDED'' Someone set up an IRC channel. Carpool/ bus from New Jersey? Some brave anon want to host a site?

===Philadelphia, PA: Sunday, February 10, 11:00am===
	 
'''PHILADELPHIA CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY''' - Feb 10th 2008 @ '''11:00AM''' EST (UPDATED Feb 5th at 12:50AM)

:1315 Race Street (near 13th and Race, see Google Maps and Street View)
:Philadelphia, PA 19107
:Tel: (215) 564-1547
:Hours: M-F 9.3AM to 9.3PM, S-S 9.3AM to 6PM

'''meeting time''': 10:00AM-11:00 AM (We will probably give you slow anon's a few extra minutes, but 11:00AM is the preferred time!)

'''meeting location''': Philadelphia City Hall Statue Thing. (Flyers will mark the way from the subway up to meeting place for those taking SEPTA!)
[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=&daddr=39.953141,-75.164617&mra=mi&mrsp=0&sz=20&sll=39.953091,-75.164257&sspn=0.000291,0.001245&ie=UTF8&ll=39.953141,-75.164384&spn=0.000291,0.001245&t=h&z=20&om=0 Location of Statue.]

'''dress code''': BLACK SUITS REQUIRED (males, tie optional) or dress as nice as possible!!!

'''expected participants''': As of 2/05: Confirmed: 47, Possible: 71.

'''laws''': NO MASKS (punishable by fine), try to find other means to conceal yourself using hats, wigs, dark glasses, face paint, scarves, or bandannas. More laws TBA, an anon is investigating and notifying authorities.

'''supplies needed''': large and bold signs, videocameras, boomboxes with tunes, your dedicated friends, flyers of anything you think would help. As stated in a few other places, AVOID THE WORD HATE IN YOUR SIGNS. Remember, we don't want to be associated as a "hate" group. 

'''transportation''': Public transportation is HIGHLY reccommended for the following reasons: 1) We are meeting at city hall, that is a big stop for both the El (Blue Line, or Market-Frankford Line) and the Broad St Line (Orange Line). 2) To keep Scientologists from casing us, Public Transportation is easy to use to duck out and lose a casing scientologist. However, if you must drive, the general suggestion is that you park either nearby on Market Street, or on Broad Street (north or south) so that it is easy to get onto a subway and up to City Hall. If you opt to not use Public transportation at all, there is LOTS of parking around, but be forewarned, the Philadelphia Auto Show is also in town, so you will be competing for spaces. [http://www.septa.org/maps/click_map.html The SEPTA Map can be found here.] SEPTA lines stretch all over Greater Philadelphia, and a nice strategy for using a line from Norristown into 15th Street is noted [http://ethernet.ath.cx/clanxdrx/showpost.php?p=9265&postcount=63 here].

'''conduct''': This is a peaceful and nonviolent protest, so if you want action go fuck off. We will remain calm and lawful in all situations and document reactions by the scientologists. REMEMBER: We are REPRESENTING Anonymous, and are focusing on the tyranny/deception of the CoS rather than the beliefs of Scientology members. DO NOT GO INTO THIS PROTEST UNINFORMED AND DEVOID OF FACTS. Please read the effective raiding guidelines on: http://partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology/Target_IRL prior to coming down. 

'''contact''': Send emails to anonymous.phila@gmail.com to coordinate further if needed. (To be safe, create a separate untraceable email and do not reveal anything about yourself, check for changes by scifags on the wiki)

For info/suggestions contact xenuslc at hotmail dot com.

One Facebook event has been created, but marked "secret" for obvious reasons. I suggest making further groups and inviting your friends; as long as we all meet at the same place it doesn't matter if we know each other.

Press releases should be distributed to KUTV 2, KSL 5, and ABC 4, as well as the Deseret News and Salt Lake Tribune. Please edit this article if you have done so.

Any Anon willing to stay around for a while is welcome to come to the KUTV studio on Main for the start of the 5:00 PM broadcast.

IMPORTANT: Any peace officer, as defined in Utah Code Annotated section 53-13-101 et seq., charged with enforcement of city ordinances, may stop any person in a public place when he has a reasonable suspicion to believe the person has committed or is in the act of committing or is attempting to commit a public offense and may demand the person's name, address and an explanation of his or her actions. It is unlawful for any person stopped and questioned under these circumstances to knowingly and intentionally conceal or attempt to conceal his or her identity, falsely identify himself or herself, or furnish or give false or misleading information to any such peace officer. (Ord. 74-03 § 1, 2003: prior code § 32-10-1). Cooperate with the police. BE CAREFUL. If you are charged with any crime as a result of the protest, the mask will add a Class B misdemeanor.

The following steps should be taken to avoid intimidation/harassment by the CoS:

1. At least one or two people in the group should be filming, if only with camera phones. This way, if any legal action is brought, we have documentation.

2. If possible, wear a mask in order to protect your identity. Scientology's methods are no joke. Many of Anonymous and their supporters have seen V for Vendetta too many times, so Guy Fawkes masks, or Tom Cruise masks if available, are preferred.

3. Under no circumstances should you respond to any Scientologist presence with violence or threats. Scientologists who respond to protests are taught to go as far as legally allowed to goad protesters into violence or making threats, and then bring legal or police action against them. Satisfying as it might be to punch a Scientologist, their resources are too great for us to want to be involved in a legal battle with them.

4. I would suggest taking public transportation or parking away from the Scientology building. They will most likely have people with cameras waiting.

"In light of recent and previous attempts by the Church of Scientology to suppress negative media, we're using this opportunity to increase public awareness about the church's activities.

Many reports exist of Scientology being linked to use of heavy-handed tactics (including legal, physical, and psychological harassment) to discourage or prevent open and transparent studies by the media, academia and government of this organization's beliefs and practices.

While we believe that individuals have an immutable right to spirituality, we also believe that individuals have to right to engage in peaceful, open discussion about belief systems without fear of retribution."

I set up a livejournal [http://anonvsscigr.livejournal.com] account for the raid. Not sure if there needs to be a permit for demonstrating, but if one can be acquired, it would certainly help. As the mission seems to not be quite a busy area, a downtown rally at fulton/division (like the anti-war protests) might be better.

The address is not a busy area, but is also a private residence, which seems to either have just been purchased or just been put on the market. The house has a Greenridge Realty sign in the front yard, but the property does not appear to be listed on the Greenridge website. (I did a drive-by photo. I didn't notice what the sign said as far as agent or if there was a SOLD sign there. Plus, the photo I took was just a little too blurry.) </s>

Scifag outpost is at 2004 Ridge Road, Ontario. Sign out front says "Success School of Driving".

====Things For Locals To Do====
# Check out the location, find out good places to gather and raid
# Post fliers around RIT, UoR, Nazareth, etc. (LOL NAZ HAS NO FAGS-- BUT DYKES. ZOMG FLIERS WERKED ON!!!)

====Notes====
Rochester is a big city. Ontario NY is the nearest CoS location, only a half hour drive away. (28 mins for Rochester, 40 minutes for RIT)

Rochesterfags report here. Especially RIT students. RIT is a tech school, so I know there's probably a number of us here. There's shitloads of /b/tards and the like at this school, so even if not enough of us are yet "in" on the operation, it's a great recruiting ground to get more raiders. Remember, anon even to each-other. These guys infiltrated the US gov't, they can do it to us.

This also goes for anyone in Ontario, but Ontario looks like a smaller city/town/etc than Rochester, so I think Rochester should be our primary recruiting grounds.

Someone needs to research the location, see if it's still an active church, etc. Research local laws and everything.

Also, no masks, as it's against the law.  Sunglasses, and hooded sweatshirts (It's fucking cold up here anyway, so a hood/scarf should be acceptable attire regardless).  Meeting location not yet planned. /r/ing that someone in the area scout the church and local area, see where our picket will gain the most attention.

Anyone want to organize a pre-raid flier hand-out on the RIT/UoR/etc. campuses? Spread some word, build support for Anon, maybe bump up attendance on 2/10? I'll case the area tonight, looking for a good place to picket.

Flier: [[Image:UpstateNYRaid.jpg]]
>> Original writer here, didn't know that the church was in a Rochester suburb. I saw on the CoS website that it was in Roch.

Syracuse and other central NY /b/rothers: We should support our /b/rothers in Rochester, as we don't have a raid location here. Should we pass fliers out before hand at SU?

I will paper Ithaca and Cornell over the next few nights.

I can help paper some of the SU buildings (mostly the dorms and a few academic ones.)  However, I don't recommend anyone posting flyers inside of Hendrick's Chapel, it's sure to cause trouble.

(Not the OP?) Further note, for those working at Naz. Very small groups of /b/rothers. I had to inform people about this. Using "FAGS" won't be a good idea. That would offend more people on campus than anything, again small /b/rothers population. But emphasizing the Co$ crimes is a good place to start, it will attract the attention of Amnesty International, LAMBDA (Gay-Straight Alliance), Peace and Justice majors, Psych, Social Work, Religion, you understand. Tunnels would be a great place to post signs, academic buildings (Golisano aka GAC, Smyth, Psych Center (EPIC), Carrol Hall (Health Services is located there, find a Speech major or do it quickly), Shultz Center is good), students, obviously can attempt the Res Halls.

Russell Means, famous Native American activist is going to be at Nazareth on Feb 4th. Not to steal his thunder, but you may find a large group of people who would be interested in stoping discrimination/hate crimes/ cults...

Although there is no "C"o$ here, a potential mini-march could be organized.<br>

===Buffalo, NY===
February 10th - 11am
836 Main Street. Buffalo

Masks are NOT legal in NY. Wear a scarf and sunglasses if you're worried!
Dress warm! Wear layers!

Plz be taking the Metro rail so scifags don't follow you.

Also alert all U/B/ and /B/uff State students about this, especially since CO$ tried to infiltrate UB a few years ago!

[http://forums.enturbulation.org/viewtopic.php?t=128 Moar info here!]

Also there is a Sabres game that day. Plz be also handing out flyers near HSBC arena because [[over 9000]] Sabre fans will be in town. Use this to draw attention to our cause!

===Charlotte, NC Feb 10 11:00AM===
[[Image:Finiscifismall.jpg|thumb]]
Because the Charlotte mission is only open 8 hours a week (no weekends) and is in an area where there is little to no foot traffic, a small group of local anonymi will be meeting downtown instead to hand out flyers and talk to pedestrians. Raid time will be 2 o'clock to ensure maximum foot traffic. By 2 everyone's out of church and the sports bars are open.
Anyone interested in joining the SParmy may either bring their own flyers and show up, or contact anonymicharlotte@yahoo.com for more details. If you come on your own, we're bound to find each other- Charlotte's a small city.

The previous information is questionable. partyvan.info's information is more specific and therefore probably more accurate. "We will be on the corner of N. Tryon and Trade St. at 11AM." Check out [http://partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology/Target_IRL/America#North_Carolina their site] for much more information.

Per CMPD masks are not permitted. Also, if you wish to bring signs, there are rules for what signs may be constructed of. Refer to these pages for more info:

===Fayetteville, AR, February 10, 11:00AM===  
There's no church I know of guys, but there is one big place out here, and it's the U of A. As far as I know, masks out here aren't prohibited, so let's get some Guy Fawkes or Tom Cruise masks out here. I would suggest parking around Dixon St. only because of the traffic around the university. We'll be meeting up around the Stadium, and move towards campus.
This is the perfect chance for anyone in NWA to finally display some anon colors. I don't want the be the only here guys, Bentonville, Rogers, Springdale, Silom Springs. You guys really aren't that far.

===Oklahoma City, OK: February 10th, 11:00 am===
There's supposedly a church in McAlester and a Narcocon facility in Arrowhead, but seeing as the concentration of Oklahoma anons is in the metro, we're gathering there.

Please see [http://forums.enturbulation.org/viewtopic.php?t=6 this Enturbulation thread] for information on the exact location of the raid and the (optional) pre-raid meeting on Saturday evening. The proper permits have been filed with the city; the police are aware and supportive.  Media will be notified in advance. Bring signs and literature, dress neatly, Due to state laws, '''NO MASKS'''.

'''THE RAID WON'T BE HELD AT THE CHURCH-- It's secluded and no one will care. The protest is being held at the Westfield Plaza by Britomart, intersection of Queen street and Customs street.'''

Oh whoops yep you're right.

==Other Cities==
There is a 90% probability that there are raids in the other cities, especially since Scientology NZ's headquarters are in Wellington. If someone can confirm this (My IP is banned from the IRC server for some reason), that would be good. If it's the 10th and noone has done this, go by your local Scientology "church" at 11AM and see what is happening.
