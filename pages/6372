Petz community
{{crapstub}}

The petz community is where petz enthuaists,many in their 20's, go to fap over virtual pixel animals. They "create" things by "hexing". Hexing is a lesser known art form. The most popular people are the ones with the "best" hexies. These are [http://warlocktrades.blogspot.com/ Lox], [http://www.estaar.co.uk/ Star] and whoever else can churn out the same crap as everyone else. Basically, whoever can stick a bunch of spots on an edited breed base. It's not all in the spots however. Artistic elements like textures, body mods, and shading are also included.

The main forum is [http://petzforum.proboards.com/index.cgi RKC]. Of course, most members are on both to try and get more popularity. The best hexers are the ones with the most friends, because they have been on this forum for 7 years, since they were 13, which is reasonably explained because petz was released in 1995. since they have nothing better to do than create the same shit as everyone else and moan about their boyfriends and periods.
[[File:loxdifferent.png|thumb|These are two of Lox's files. As you can see, they're nothing alike. They don't even have the same eye color!]]

Sometimes members get butthurt in the extreme and feel the need to go trolling others on the intarwebz to make themselves feel better, while they cry alone at night in a dark corner because they don't know how to hex and Petz is still their LIFE.

On the contrary my dead ED writer we do not troll the intarwebz to make us feel better. We read the moan filled shit above to get out LOLz. I think you will find that people like your good self troll because they have a shit meaningless life. This article is only proof or your poor existence of a human being. 

And sometimes pathetic and childish members of the community have to go on a bitch bender moaning about people  because they aren't as valued. Get your head out of your arse, dicklick. I'm thinking someone has green eyes.
