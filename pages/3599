'''The Hampster Dance''' or Hampsterdance is one of the [[old meme|oldest internets memes]] in existence. It was originally a lame Geocities page with rows of animated GIFs of hamsters and rabbits dancing to a sped-up version of [[Whistles go whoo|"Whistle Stop"]] by Roger Miller that OMG made him sound like a hamster LOLOL!!111!  Also, yes, "hampster" is [[Spellcheck|misspelled]], but that's what was in the original site's address so get over it.

It was created by a [[lesbian]] [[art school|art student]] from [[Canada]] as a deliberate attempt to create the worlds most annoying internets [[meme]]. But the world took its revenge out on this whore as she didn't own the music used for her animation and failed to copyright the name "hampster dance" and had to register [http://www.hampsterdance2.com www.hampsterdance2.com] instead. She also had to pay royalties to [[Disney]] for stealing their lame music.

==Knock Offs==
The success of the Hampster Dance lead to every [[faggot]] with a mouse and a copy of Frontpage Express to create their own vision of the Hampster Dance and at it's peak it is estimated that there were [[over 9,000]] of them. As a result, there was invariably almost always one for everything and if there wasn't, it was only a matter of time. Seeing as most of these were on free [[geocities]] and [[fail|AngelFire]] accounts most of them have thankfully disappeared off the edge of the [[Internet]]. But still some linger on forgotten and collecting dust in the darkest corners of the interwebs.

==Music Chart Hit==
In the [[United States of Australia]] this meme was so enormously popular that it spawned a series of hit songs on the music charts and stayed there for eleventy-zillion years, pissing off all who heard it more than once.

There was also an even lamer [[shit|hit]] single in the [[United Kingdom]] that brought joy and laughter to [[13 year old boys]] at least 100 years ago.  Spare a thought for the poor rodent that was abused in the video below.

==Fact of the Day==
[[BBC|Canadian]] [[16_year_old_girls|children]]'s programme ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_Riverbank Tales Of The River Bank]'' featured a [[hamster]] called "Hammy" who used to [[marijuana|fly]] around in a [[hot]] air balloon whilst taunting [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishbone_%28TV_series%29 Wishbone the Historical Dog].
