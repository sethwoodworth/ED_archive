[[Common knowledge|It is widely known]] that the [[internet]] is swimming with [[GOTIS|copious]] [[USI|quantities]] of [[Cancer|corrosive]] [[AIDS|contagions]] that [[Rape|creep]] into [[Fact|every user that dares to step in]]. Among these [[GRIDS|diseases]] are [[Neopets|virtual]] [[Wajas|pet]] [[Masturbation|simulation]] sites: [[gay sex|public baths]] created by and made for [[furries]], [[16 year old girls]], and [[asspies]]. Unsurprisingly, each pet site ends up being a [[Copypasta|rip-off]] of the last, trying desperately to Jew as much jewgolds as possible from their [[Retard|userbase]] by offering overpriced features that offer [[Truth|absolutely nothing of value]], online or off.

'''Aywas''' [[Bullshit|is no exception]]. Actually, it might be worse than every other shit site combined. Like the rest of those unoriginal, [[Work safe|bland]] websites, the [[Faggots|staff of Aywas]] [[Shit|has managed to make an entire game]] out of screwing each of its brainless users out of every penny they own.

What sets Aywas apart from the [[Neopets|competition]] is... oh yeah. Nothing. You can [[Beastiality|breed your pets]], [[Trace|have their lineart changed]], and many other [[Rape|awesome things]], as long as you don't mind paying out the ass.

==The Site itself==
[[File:Itsnotmeguiz.jpg|thumb|left|How the admins help their users.]]

Aywas, like the rest of the virtual pet simulation websites on the internet, has made its sole purpose to steal money from its [[Furry|retarded]] [[16 year old girl|userbase]]. The goal of Aywas is to [[Pokemon|capture, buy, and collect the various species and color schemes available]], and to [[Unrealistic Expectations|achieve such a goal]] one must fork out the dough. Oddly enough, this community’s business sense resembles that of children's politics: “My daddy is bigger than yours, so I get ''all'' the candy”. In this case, the “candy” would be tiny, pixelated creatures with [[Zeriara|hideous designs]], [[Branca|poor lineart]], [[SapphyDracases|shoddy coloring]], and [[Trufax|cost enough to feed a Somalian village for a year]].

You are expected to try and make the [[Fursona|sexiest pet]] on the site and then brag about it to others because you [[Asking for it|totally earned it]]. The site also updates every month with several new pets that you can purchase via – you guessed it - real money! Because it’s [[Bullshit|totally worth]] paying $10 for a [[Retard|tiny pixilated furfag on the internet]].


The site was [[Shit|founded]] by [[Slashfic|Slash]], an indecisive faggot, late in 2009 because all of the other [[Porn|virtual pet sites]] were [[Uncyclopedia|"too boring"]]. Slash demonstrated his [[Stupid|superior decision-making ability]] when he revealed that he hired [[Troll|Qwayzar]], a coder, paying $5000 to code Aywas. ''IN ADVANCE."" Stroke of sheer genius there. Qwayzar coded minor shifts so that everything could function with his framework. He then grew bored of Slash's bitching and lack of originality and quit, saying it was because he wanted to “[[Masturbation|work for himself]]”. It is also painfully apparent that Qwayzar’s work was [[Shit|sub-par]], being only worth a mere $15. It was soon discovered that fixing his sloppy coding would cost approximately '''$5000'''. Because of this [[Abortion|botched birth]], the site has come out [[Down Syndrome|horribly disfigured]], and the [[Fags|site staff]] are trying to Jew as much money as they can out of their users in order to pay for the [[Drugs|corrective surgery]], which honestly isn't much of an improvement.

==Pets==
[[File:RAREST_FAGGOTRY_EVER.png|thumb|The rarest pet of the site. You want it. YOU WANT IT.]]
There are several Aywas species that resemble animals in real life for example, [[Sea Kittens|“gael” instead of fish]], and “melo” instead of dog.  Not only are there nineteen species but there are countless recolors of each species.

A majority of these creatures are found by [[Pokemon|exploring the world and catching them]] with virtual equipment that you pay with real money.Other species are so special that you can only get them through lucky “zaps”, random potions or items or by expensive custom crystals. There is however an [[useless|Aywapedia]] that is used as guide, however, it is outdated and never updated thus rendering it completely useless and another waste of money.

One nifty feature of the site that attracts visitors is the ability to customize your pet. Like everything else on the site you must pay depending on which breed you chose, how much editing was made, the amount of lens flare and BeeJay’s mood. As a result, $25 to $100 is spent on creating the typical emo/sparkly/bloody pet the owner desires.

For a small fee of just $25, users can breed two pets of the same species. The breeding will result anywhere from one to four offspring but typically two is produced. This causes most players to split the fee so that each can have one offspring. From January to March of 2010, Aywas’ true laziness shines as a great number of offspring never showed up. Users approached BeeJay about this situation and asked why their expensive [[babby]]s haven’t arrived. She has responded to them stating that they were done but that she was just too lazy to even upload the images.

[[File:FailArts.jpg|thumb|Lineart request getting the usual "no" from BJ.|left]]

After a week, she finally uploaded them all and major issues were met. Such issues included stray lines, poor edits and bad coloration. BeeJay got so fed up with the comments that she threw a hissy fit and blamed it on the user’s .psd source files. The ultimate decision made by the mods was that the users would have the ability to color their own offspring.

One thing Aywas is notable for is the obsession of constantly revamping the images of their species as a ploy to get their users to shell out more cash. This is referred to as '''line art changes'''. Take a scenario in which a user has already paid to customize some old line art. They can simply buy a draw crystal which costs about $5 then pay an unrelated artist to color the line art for $10 to resemble the old version. This all is followed by BeeJay giving the typical “no” because one tiny detail just isn’t right.

Only the best of the best would have this amazing privilege of gaining a '''hybrid''' Aywa. Two different species will only spawn one offspring and that’s for the low price of $75 and that is if the required breeding crystals are even available. Unlike normal breeding, users will only receive one hybrid out of cross breeding. On top of that edits on the parents are usually not carried down to the hybrid and users are basically pushed into a corner in which they have to pay more just to modify the hybrid even further.

==Key People==
[[File:28amdep.jpg|thumb|The only known picture of the Aywas moderators.]]
*'''Slash''' – Known for begging for money ever since he wasted it all on shit coding. Slash’s gender is widely unknown and debates were waged on whether or not to call Slash male or female. Slash claims to be male however the article regarding Aywas refers to him as a female. He is probably just a tranny wannabe.
*'''BeeJay/[[Blowjob|BJ]]''' - Known for being the PMSing bitch of the site due to being rude, impatient and abrupt. In 2010 BJ finally got sick of Slash's bullshit and left her position as second-in-command.  Since leaving, BJ has actually become relatively nice.
*'''Frey''' - The exact opposite of BJ; a complete pussy.
*'''Airr''' - Likes to add herself into ED articles. Was a popular user and great artist; however, she left because she was busted abusing her breeding privileges, and came back under the name of "Basil". It was rumored that she finally got tired of the Slash's idiocy, but she probably started that herself.
*'''Mokitty''' - Mokitty is well-known for her bizarre custom creations. Likely she was made a moderator because Slash wanted access to all of her art before it could be sold elsewhere. Ever since Mo became a mod her custom creations have become nonexistent. Perhaps she now feels popular enough that she doesn't have to pump out thousands of [[b|/b/]]-inspired creatures that were really never all that funny in the first place. 
*'''WyrGecko''' - Well-known as keeping a lair full of Every. Single. Aywa. on the market. Despite her collection, her taste in customs is disgusting, consisting of nothing other than neon-green critters reminiscent of Nickelodeon's Slime.
*'''Skitty''' - Once known as a rather nice and fair user, once she took on her modship she went batshit insane.  Skitty has the OH-SO-IMPORTANT job of deciding which crystal a custom will use, and thus how much it will cost to make.  But don't worry, as long as you are lodged safely up her ass you can get away with ANYTHING!  The more she likes you, the more you can edit the stock lineart and still keep it in 'bronze crystal (or 'we-[[raep]]-your-wallet-less') range.

==Community and events==
[[File:Failrage.jpg|thumb|left|Just a normal day in the Aywas community.]]

The word that best describes Aywas’ community would be “fucked”.  Users are often unsatisfied with certain payments or the sheer stupidity of the mod’s decisions. On one hand, the mods are brainless morons who wouldn't know what a good decision looked like if it bit them in the ass. On the other, the user base is filled with whiny brats that can’t live without Aywas. Most events occur when a [[Divide by zero|random item multiplies due to a glitch]], due to the absolute shit coding. Then said item is confiscated and deleted from the website. This result in users whining about how unfair it is that they didn’t get any of the items.

On May 2, 2010, Slash has revealed the wonderful [[Science|genetics]] of the world of Aywas stating that hybrids will only have a 10% chance of inheriting the paid edits from their parents. That means that users will happily spend $75 on a hybrid with no edits and they will like it. This adds more drama as people were already complaining about having to pay $75 for one hybrid whereas it used to be common to have two.

{{squote|There has been some concern with how people are expecting edits on hybrid offspring to pass over from two edited parents. '''The sheer fact that people expect this is something that needs to stop''', as it was intended to be a rare occurrence for babies. '''Edits are a [[bribe|privilege]]'''. All hybrid artists have been informed of this and now I am informing all of you that the chance for hybrids to have edits is now 10%.|Slash's initial news post|God Forbid she lose out on a few extra dollars. Silly users. Why should you expect anything for $75?}}

Frey, realizing that Slash is an incompetent bitch, tried to convince Slash out of this ridiculous plan. After a day, the percentage went up to 20% with the promise of flipping a coin, rolling a dice or some other trivial method to give people the possibility of multiple line art edits. Finally Frey has concluded with the following statement.

{{squote|More discussion has prompted that we're going to allow a better compromise for how edits on hybrids are handled now. We're hoping this ends up sounding fairer in the end. We are going to '''let''' [that's not condescending at all] you have edits 50% of the time when you breed using a Breeding Coin, which is similar to now. However, to push our '''[[Conspiracy|agenda]]''' of non-edited hybrids, any breeding where the two parents are non-edited will have a slightly higher chance of getting an extra offspring. We are also putting the limit at edits on hybrid offspring at 25%.|Frey}}

[[File:Melo diamonddust.png|thumb|The new and improved melo.]]

A few days later, most of these decisions were repealed and new rules, which were exactly like the old ones, were placed. However, safe guards were placed in order to assure that people would not pay so much on overlays. Ironically, the word “overlay” refers to anything they don’t like about their offspring. Some artists were put on probation; however, they neglected to tell who was behind the atrocities labeled as hybrids. Later on, it was revealed that Slash has been looking for outside artists to recolor the pets at a whopping rate of $2 per pet. But [[¯\(°_o)/¯|where did the remaining $73 go?]]

Sometime ago, Slash decided to completely fuck up the pets. However, he promised that the sacred melo, the most popular pet, would never fall victim to such drastic changes. But by the end of August 2010, Slash asked the website if they wanted a revamp. The majority of the user base responded [[no]] to his proposal but he then followed up with a cluster of empty promises until enough of the ignorant n00bs were persuaded.

When the new and 'improved' artwork of the melo was revealed, it was ultimately labeled as [[shit|terrible]] by the users and they began to regret their choice of letting Slash tamper with the most beloved pet on the website. Despite numerous complaints, polls and suggestions, Slash ignored all of them because it doesn’t matter what the users think once Slash sets his mind on something. After all, Slash is the most important user on the site, dontchaknow?

This finally ended by early September when the “perfect” melo was unveiled. Those that were still unhappy had to suck it, but if they wanted the old line art then they could simply just throw more money at Slash to get it.


'''Jan. 2011 Scavenger Hunt''' -
Guess the first one didn't cause enough BAWWWWW, don't worry though! It's back! And with 100% ''moar'' tasks based around site wealth! ''Totally'' fair, amirite? Right! ''Especially'' if you're on Team [[Elitist|YoDa]]. Last Scavenger Hunt [[Elitist|YoDa]] came out on top, no surprise there right? They totally [[cheated|won fair and square]] and ended up with more points than even possible, and, just as we all predicted, insisted Slash had added wrong. Of course [[dumbass|Slash]] believed their [[lies|honest word]]. But this time, the task list seems as if it were made just for YoDa. And it probably was if [[bitchdyke|BJ]] saw it three days before the hunt started, like last year.

Some of the impossible-to-every-team-but-YoDuhh-tasks are:

'''Collect Every Item That Ever Existed Ever''' (Yes, that includes all the rares [[noob|you'll]] never have.)  - ''Because, you know, the only [[snob|people]] who have EVERYTHING are all on one [[Yoda|team]].''

'''Code Shit That Slash Can Use For Aywas For Free''' - ''Ok fine. So maybe this one is still possible, even if you're not YoDa. Though YoDa does have Wyrgecko, [[coincidence|who just so happens to be able to code]] Evident from her coding shop. Very weird indeed.''

'''Every Pet That Ever Was Ever''' - ''Everybody, besides [[assholes|YoDa]], is too busy enjoying life to sit and collect worthless pixels on [[hell|Aywas]]. No surprise there.''

'''Waste A Hybrid Potion On A Site Pet''' - '' It's okay, they all have 5 more, what's one less going to do?''


Pretty much everything in this hunt is based around site wealth, popularity, and [[blowjobs|cock sucking]] ability. All of which YoDa seems to possess and more.
To those not "kewl enough" to join YoDa, I bid you luck in your fight for 2nd place.

Ah, but YoDa wasn't the only team [[cheat|with an unfair advantage]].  Just about every team that placed had one or more mods as members.  Team "Whip Mah Hairrr" even had Slash as a 'mascot'.  Of course they placed!



'''Jan. 2011 - Introduction of the Bronze Crystal'''

This handy item was introduced halfway through the Scavenger Hunt and allows a user to pay $15 to make a custom with 30% or less edits.  This crystal is lodged safely between metal (0% edits) and blue (50%), and is soooo inexpensive that all members can buy a bajillion of them!  This has led numerous members to throw up tons and tons and tons of their pets, asking Skitty "ARE ANY OF THEZE BRONZE?!?!"  Unfortunately, depending on how much Skitty likes the owner, it doesn't seem to matter what percentage they really are... To her they will always be bronze.
