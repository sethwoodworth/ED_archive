'''Fort Hood''', also known as the [[Islam]] meets [[US]] Army sequel to [[V-Tech]], is the location of a well-played round of expert mode [[School_Shooting|school shooter]] by [[Some Guy|some guy]] who apparently never grew up. On November 5, 2009, [[muslim|Major Malik Nadal Hasan]] went [[batshit]] and [[Columbine|shot up 13 people]], [[win|injuring many more]], on no less than [[America]]'s largest army base, happening to be in [[Texas|the biggest fucking state]] (who could have guessed?).  The shooter was a third-rate [[irony|psychiatrist]] who'd been advanced to major (in spite of fail) to prove some kind of point about love and understanding. 

As news sites raced to out-[[first post|first-post]] each other, the [[fact]]s were distorted by a [[Do not want|reluctance]] to release his name or photo for the first day or two (yeah right, typical shooting rampage, [[Not|don't think so]]). 

What we '''did''' know was that [[Virginia Tech|Vtech]] just went camo. 

After the press caved in to the people's right to know, we got a flood of [[PC|pathetic excuses]] for the [[whore]] in news articles for the rest of the week. Meanwhile, a flood of loser [[blog]]gers and [[liar|columnists]] jumped in to use Hasan's massive fail to push [[the R-word|stupid]] agendas (usually [[moar]] pathetic excuses, [[Islam]], or [[Israel]]). Columbia Pictures is expecting to release the film adaptation early next year. 

And it all happened on [[Guy Fawkes]] ([[Anonymous]]) Day!

Facts about the Fort Hood massacre are scarce due to army [[facepalm|embarrassment]]. With two large-clip [[gun|pistols]] in hand, whether or not he needed to reload is unclear. Current reports indicate that the shooter is wounded but alive and is able but unwilling to cooperate with the investigation. 

While 13 victims is not a [[high score]], it is a new high score at the [[Doom|nightmare difficulty]] level of own goals on a military base. The bad guys on this level had infinite ammo (no guns though) as well as nearly infinite men and the largest cache of armored vehicles in the continental [[US]]. The major is also believed to have received an expert marksman mark in [[fail|bootcamp]] at Fort Bragg.  

Unfortunately, he gets no bonus points. 
His rampage was allegedly stopped by a [[feminism|girl]] then a nigger as the press decided which cause to deify and he didn't even earn [[An Hero]] achievement points [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2009/11/12/2009-11-12_civilian_cop_mark_todd_was_real_hero_whose_shots_ended_ft_hood_masscare_says_his.html]. 

Game over, "Major Hasan": not just a traitor but you don't even get your 72 virgin boys to [[Buttsecks|butt-fuck]] in hell 'cos you were too much of a [[pussy]] to [[An Hero|off yourself]]. His final slugging average as of the 5th of November is 13/38, far short of [[Virginia Tech Massacre|Cho]]'s 31/29 on [[college|easy mode]].

The FBI knew that Hasan had tried to contact Al Qaeda but did nothing about it. [[Gg]], [[CryptoKids]].

==The Dichotomy Of Nidal Malik Hasan==
===The United States Army Officer===
[[Image:Phillieshasan2.jpg|thumb|[[dangerdan]]'s dad?]]
[[Image:Nidal Hasan.jpg|thumb|[[Awesome|Major Awesome!]]]]
'''Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan''' was the army psychiatrist who benefited from [[PC|affirmative action]] in a huge way then balked at the idea of being sent to [[Afghanistan|Goatfuckistan]].  He balked so hard, he had to shoot 13 fellow soldiers to death and grievously wounded 38 other suckers in a speedy shoot-out on November 5, 2009 at the Fort Hood Army Base in ''Kill''een, Texas (named after Dolly Parton's classic song <i>"Killeen, Killeen, Killeen, Killeen, I'm begging of you, please don't kill  my man"</i>).

Was he just a seriously disgruntled [[dangerdan|Philadelphia Phillies fan]], maddened by the inferior efforts of his team to obtain a second World Series title? 

Early reports on MSNBC claimed that Major Hasan attended [[Virginia]] Tech. Between [[Michael Vick]], [[Cho]], and this, that's strike three. Encyclopedia Dramatica would like to salute [[Virginia Tech]] for its [[drama]]tocratic productivity. 

Hasan was also known for being pissed off at other Muslims for not being devout enough while he regularly attended [[fat|Texas strip clubs]].

===The Psychiatric Doctor===
[[Image:Cropped-Hasan--vitals.com-screenshot.jpg|thumb|1 star out of 4?  Ouch. Also, [[lol]] at 'caring doctor'.]]

Hasan is a psychiatrist and spent his days surrounded by people who might seem just as likely to shoot up a military base or college campus as he is if we could only forget his affiliations.  Some [[internet detectives]] found his [http://www.vitals.com/terms?next=doctor/profile/1811199052 doctor review page].  Unsurprisingly, his ratings were complete shit.  His last client was also being deployed to Iraq, making Hasan super [[emo]], and posted this comment on the same day that Hasan became a legend:

{{quote|Although he was hard to understand (strong accent) this doctor helped me come to terms with my conscientious objector status.  While I am still not thrilled about being deployed to Iraq, I at least understand how doing so to protect my fellow soldiers is a good thing.|Pvt J. Hammond}}

This proves that [[cyberbullying|saying "mean things" on the internet]] is a life or death situation.

===The Retaliation===
{{Main|Jason Rodriguez}}
Only a day after Hasan's lulzy trollfest, a devout Yankees fan took things in to his own hands. His name was [[JROD|Jason Rodriguez]] and as an attempt to one-up his Philadelphian counterpart, he started shooting some former co-workers in an office building in Orlando. JROD's victims were so much fewer than Fort Hood's that he didn't even attempt to kill himself or confront police. That's right, he just walked away and no one had any idea where he went. He was eventually brought in to custody a few hours later. In any case, the world series of killing people appears to be going to game 3.

==Obama Responds==

Just after the tragic shootings occurred, President Obama was notified by his press corps.  Here is a brief synopsis of his reaction:

{{squote|When I spoke here last winter, this nation was facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs per month. Credit was frozen. And our financial system was on the verge of collapse. 

As any American who is still looking for work or a way to pay their bills will tell you, we are by no means out of the woods. A full and vibrant recovery is still many months away. And I will not let up until those Americans who seek jobs can find them until those businesses that seek capital and credit can thrive; until all responsible homeowners can stay in their homes. That is our ultimate goal. But thanks to the bold and decisive action we've taken since January, I can stand here with confidence and say that we have pulled this economy back from the brink...<b>oh, and by the way some shit went down in Texas, but nobody cares about Texas because rednecks are worse than sand-niggers. Also: HEALTHCARE HEALTHCARE HEALTHCARE! </b>|}}

==The Moar You Know: Hajj Edition==

*The police officer who put four holes in his bomb tossing ass was a SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, the worst kind of single, white female. Take that you bomb-tossing, wife-beating pork fuckers.  Allah is ashamed!
*The bitch who shot him used SWAT hax to raise her accuracy.
*[[Pro|He killed 13 and injured 38 at an army base in only 3 minutes.]]
*He's a [[irony|psychiatrist]]. [[In b4]] [[Scientology]] complaining, as gun control faggots shouldn't be able to touch this one.
*He fucking [[win|survived]], GO [[navy|ARMY]]!
*Turning Albert Camus' words about the stranger killing an Arab on their head, Hasan made himself into an [[Arab]] stranger killing a lot of his comrades for no good reason. 
*M. Night Shyamalan has already acquired the movie rights. What a twist!
*He should have been psyched about going "[[Middle East|home]]" on deployment, join up with the folks back home and all, but ...
*He was butthurt that [[Black Jesus]] isn't pulling troops out of [[Afghanistan|Durkadurkastan]].
*He was seen giving away Qur'ans, furniture, and blowjobs on the morning of the spree. 
*He used the [[Call_of_duty_4|Last Stand perk]] to try and kill the cop that took him down.
*He was brought down by a girl. For a jihadi like Hasan, that's like getting pwned by a goomba in [[Mario]].
*He had Phillies in 7, so instead he put 13 in heaven.
