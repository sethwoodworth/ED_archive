'''[http://www.knowyourmeme.com Know Your Meme]''' is essentially the end product of greedy [[The Man|corporate intervention]] into ''anything'' [[OTI]].  The site itself, which was for a short time a subsidiary of multi-national corporate giant [[Sony]], was created entirely for the benefit of the [[newfags|newest of new]] and the odd over-the-hill, [[old media]] [[NORP|type]].  It is distinct from other sites (e.g. [[The Lurkmoar Wiki|Lurkmoar wiki]]) in that '''Know Your Meme''' is clearly intended for [[serious business|mass commercialization]] of every [[limecat|"cute"]] [[meme]] that ever sprang forth from a *[[chan]].  It's also mostly [[safe for work]], which is fucking [[lame]]. 

Since its inception, KYM has had no shame [[greed|corporatizing]] the internet culture they take no part in and, moreover, are exceedingly [[asking for it|arrogant]] about this fact.  You will often see this smarmy attitude first-hand from the odd [[mod]] or [[douchebag|site rep]] attempting to justify the site's existence with such disingenuous statements like "nobody owns a meme, we all do", which is fine, except [[irony|they are a fucking company that is making money off of them at the same time]].  If they could [[copyright]] every meme in existence, they would - a corporation's eternal mission is the divide and conquer mindset.  It is basically [[I Can Has Cheezburger?]] raised to the tenth power and with 100 times the [[faggotry]].  The site survives largely off of retarded [[YouTube]] users, [[Gaia]]fags, and legions of other [[you|12 year olds]].  


==History==
[[Image:Staff from know your meme.jpg|thumb|left|200px||We're in ur memes, fucking them up.]]
[[Image:Kym.png|thumb|1. Kill Your Meme<br> 2.[[????]]<br> 3.[[PROFIT!]]]]
[[Image:Memeprofit.JPG|thumb|You may ask "why don't my videos have ads on them?" Because they don't generate money like Rocketboom does!]]
Although the site has been up since December 18th, 2007, it's surprisingly small and lacks content.  /b/ on its worst day will never be as corrupted by newfaggotry and [[AIDS]].  They hired {{youtube2|mememolly|mememolly}} to anchor their "webshow" in July, 2009, who just happens to also be in the [[jewgold|YouTube Partner Program]].  

What's worse is KYM signed a major distribution deal with [[Japs|Sony]] in [[2008]]. Now you can learn about memes while you're browsing on your fucking [[iPhone]] in class or playing [[MWF2]] on your [[PS3]]!  Soon enough, you'll see [[niggers]], [[kike]]s, and [[guido]]s walking down the street wearing XXXXL shirts stating that their [[penis]] size is [[over 9000]].  Supposedly this deal fell through not long after, but it will not be long before they're sucking more corporate [[cock]].

[[Image:Knowyourmemecancer.jpg|thumb|right|KYM will deadpool any memes they can't profit from.]]
KYM/Rocketboom managed to multiply already unthinkable faggotry with their Jewtube "webshow".   The show consists of some [[whore]] show host or similarly clueless "[[dipshits|researchers]]" doing their best to read a fucking teleprompter or script to explain any given meme in the most [[unfunny|WACKY]] way possible. Soon everything you used to hold sacred will be able to be downloaded to some retards [[PSP]] for [[WTF|the low price of just $19.95]]...the days of reading through endless lines of boring [[text]] are over! Just watch a short YouTube video, and you'll be an instant oldfag. You can now spout memes with the best of them: '''LOL HAY U GUISE ALL YOUR BASE ARE AN HERO OVER 9000 MILHOUSE XD AM I COOL YET?'''

*Know Your Meme constantly get their facts wrong. In their video on [[Weegee]], they state that he simply originated as a creepy drawing that someone uploaded on the internet, completely glazing over the fact that Weegee is undeniably real, and will kill you. They also contend that [[Pedobear]] [[WTF|PROTECTS]] lolis. We all know how wrong that is.
*Unsurprisingly, KnowYourMeme.com was named [[Time Magazine]]'s 50th best website of [[2009]], which is ironic because all of its content is derived from other websites.   
*It is also completely useless because you could just use [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] to research any meme that's worth two shits, and [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|many which aren't]].

Every other week or so, "[[Assholes|researchers]]" from the thoroughly tongue-in-cheek [[Wut|Rocketboom Institute for Internet Studies]] explain what's funny on the Web and why â€” so [[Fail|you can be 1337 and have a life too]]. |Time Magazine|completely disregarding '''other websites''' ("wink wink") that did what they do about a decade earlier and much, much better.|color=silver|size=360%}}
