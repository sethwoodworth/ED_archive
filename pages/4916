Lmao
[[Image:LMAO IRL.jpg|thumb|right|[[IRL]]]]

Similar to [[lol]] and [[rofl]] in its usage, '''lmao''' is used to express [[lulz]]. The main difference being that you have to use ''four different keys'' on your keyboard, compared to only two with lol. For this reason lazy bastards use lol more, and rarely ever use "ROFLMAOAY," which is only ever used by [[fucktards]].

Another alternative includes adding an "f" to make "LMFAO."  The "f" stands for "fucking" (laughing my fucking ass off) to add more "lulz".

Lmao isn't as good as lol[http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&word1=lol&word2=lmao], but can defeat the almighty lulz[http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&word1=lulz&word2=lmao].  However, lmao suffers a considerable loss to cheese[http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&word1=cheese&word2=lmao].  Anyone who doubts the omniscient knowledge of [[Google#Google_Fight|Google Fight]] is obviously a [[fucktard]].
