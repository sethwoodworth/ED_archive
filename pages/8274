The New Effort
{{stub}}

'''The New Effort (TNE)''' is a forum about [[SASS|a forum]] about [[Something_Awful|a forum]] created by "former" goon [[#Hangly Man|Hangly Man]] to replace the [[Something Awful Sycophant Squad]] message board. Unlike SmyD, funny shit actually happens at TNE.{{citation|citation needed|fagmins smyd}} In recent months TNE has moved away from trolling [[SomethingAwful]], as that requires actual effort, and instead prefers to pick at more low hanging fruits like [[Reddit]], [[OKCupid]], [[Kicesie|some crybaby slut on youtube]] and [[Onideus Mad Hatter|a tubby faggot in a shack]]. In addition, TNE's administration has developed the ability of making balding, middle aged men meltdown over people they know only over the Internet. TNE IS FULL OF THERMITE, NIGROSEXUALS and Tim Dang posts.
