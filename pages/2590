'''Ecuador''' is a country in South America, cleverly placed right on top of the Equator. 

Though in most respects quite like its next-door neighbour, [[Peru]] -- vast [[cocaine|coca]] plantations, ridiculously high-altitude cities, a hat-and-poncho-mad populace -- Ecuador is different in one crucial way. Acting at the behest of friendly [[Colombia|Colombian]] millionaires, its citizens have taken to building huge submarines in the coastal swamps, filling them up with tons of cocaine, and delivering the coke wherever it is needed. 

These submarines are as much as 100 feet long, are equipped with air conditioning and machine guns and can go more than 5,000 miles underwater without surfacing.

It is 3,527 miles from coastal Ecuador to [[Los Angeles]]. It is [[Over 9000|9,009]] miles to [[Tokyo]].
