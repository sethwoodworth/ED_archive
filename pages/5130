Mailing list
[[Image:Listserv.gif|thumb|Why [[troll]]ing is so easy.]]

Email lists with subscribers. This [[old media]] is used for the purpose of discussion or disseminating a large amount of email to a select group of people quickly and efficiently. In the days pre-[[web forum]], they were the only way to really communicate with other [[alpha geek]]s to get help with various technical issues. Still prevalent today, although somewhat in decline.

==Drama on Mailing Lists==
[[Drama]] on mailing lists is extremely effective, because everyone on the list receives every piece of e-mail. 

To prolong the drama, you should reply to each message in the conversation (to all of course) with "Please do not reply to the list", "Isn't this off-topic", etc. This is the mailing list predecessor of [[NO BINARIES]].  

If you want to generate even more drama, send a long message announcing that you are [[Quitting IRC forever|unsubscribing]] with detailed reasons why.  Then, don't unsubscribe, and reply to every reply with "Please do not reply to the list".

:Subject: [Cs430] Outputting XPM Images
:To: cs430@face.cs...
:Ok, so I'm using a matrix for storing my pixel map and then printing that out to a file.  However, since I'm outputting 250,000 or so characters for a 499x499 image, it takes forever, I'm about to try using string buffering instead of string concatination, but I'm not expecting much improvement.  Got any ideas?

:::My idea:
:::A) I already wrote my XPM output and its fast as shit mr lj.  Maybe its cuz I use a man's programming language, and you use pussy-shit java.

:::B) It is Saturday night, drink a fucking beer stop writing code.  You are lucky we are having a pong tournament at my apartment and thus I saw this at this hour.

::::To: cs430@face.cs...
::::Dear class,
:::: 
::::I would like to take this time to apologize for my email I sent last Saturday night.  This email was completely inappropriate; while my intent was never to send it to the full list, it should not have been written in the first place.  Please accept my apologies, and be assured that it will not happen again.  If any of you felt offended, feel free to contact me and I will speak with you directly, otherwise I hope we can put this matter behind us and continue with a healthy class environment.

::::Sincerely,

Tell Major Major Major Majordomo that Eric Thomas made this shit up. Similar to a [[BCO]] A listserv is an automatic mailing list server.  You send an e-mail request to a central location with certain words in the subject or body of the mailing.  Soon you will be a member of this listserv and will undoubtedly receive thousands of pointless e-mails written by pointless people regarding pointless crap about which you joined in the first place.  People on the internets think slow and like to do things really fast.  You can use a listserv to connect with like minded people's that share a common interest in the same crap that you like and have the e-mails sent directly to your inbox.  This is very convenient for people that like to sit and stare at their outlook express hoping that someone will write to them.  Such popular listserv's have included the Jonathan Taylor Thomas mail server, Postal Blowfish, some Star Trek crap, some church crap and countless listservs about Wonder Woman's titties.  [[Flame wars]]  began when the early [[Internets|netizen]]’s of listserv’s and [[BCO]]’s realized that they didn’t need to be nice to anyone on the internets since no one can see you with your hand on your cock through a cathode ray tube monitor.  unless you’re a 30 year old [[camwhore]] that shaves your nether regions and gets [[13 year old boys]] to [[j/o]] with you, which is a different story altogether.

==Usage==
Listservs can be used for [[good]] as well as [[evil]]. Please follow these guidelines to allow for maximum [[lulz]]:
* Always reply to all
* Always include binaries (see [[NO BINARIES]])
* Always email the list with admin tasks (unsubscribes, digests, etc.)
