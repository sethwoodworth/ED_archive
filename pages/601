Argent009
[[Image:Lulz agent.jpg|center]]
{{TOCright}}
[[Argent009]], also known as ''"RollerPig"'' or '''The Mole''', and now re-registered as '''Argentium009''', is a 43-year-old [[gay]] [[cripple]] on disability who [[Fellatio|mooches off]] his [[Lemonparty|senior-citizen]] partner, Roy, for rent and food.  Slightly [[crazy|off his rocker]], he spends his days on the internet trying to get hired by '''Steve Chen''' at [[YouTube]] and '''The Vice President of Content''' at [[livevideo]] [http://www.livevideo.com/Argent009], and has a penchant for class action lawlsuits and is apparently involved with the '''International Web Police''', [http://www.thecomputerwizard.biz/fp_letter_to_victims.txt], thus diagnosing him with a srs case of [[victim complex]]. He, like many other [[failfags]] believed he would take down [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]]...as always [[lulz]] ensued, along with epic fail. 

He also bares a stunning resemblance to [[Cyndre]], has a lump-crease of fat on his forehead, and has been trolled by [[bantown]] [http://host.encyclopediadramatica.com/calls/argent009-cropped.mp3 here]. In what could not have been better timing, Argent009 experienced profound [[butthurt]] (possibly Ray ran out of lube) and [[Quitting IRC forever|quit YouTube forever]]. And he really means it [[at least 100|this time]]. As part of his retreat to the [[hugbox]] of [[The Promised Land]], Argent009 ceded all of YouTube to the authority of [[Bantown]] and its designated representatives.

More recently, Argent had a heart attack and has been listed in critical condition.

== Coup on [[YouTube]] ==
[[Image:Argentkilling.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Argent is [[serious business]].]]

All the while during the [[PeppermintPatti]] drama, Argent was going on a pseudo-campaign to gain control and leadership over the [[Youtube Street Team]], after an email received from a top rep at [[YouTube]].  He was later found too annoying and unstable to fit the position, and is now [[moar]] e-humble. The following is a [[copypasta]] of a poorly written, cryptic, e-mail user [[wattage]] received in his mailbox.  All of the following is verbatim.

''<blockquote>Argent009 is already dancing upon command, he is pretending to post his Steve Chen emails as a response to one of Renetto's videos, when all he is really trying to do is stop Steve Chen from backing out off employing him.</blockquote>''

''<blockquote>Argent009 is only PRETENDING to be the General of the coalition to stop the haters. No one actually follows him. If he gets any power he will only put his few friends on the Street Team, no one else would work with him.</blockquote>''


== The Battle of Argent009 ==
{{MoarYoutube|Argent009/YouTube}}
 When Argent009 heard of the trolling 
 done by wattagecat and [[ED]], 
 he reacted with an eerie, dark video 
 with death metal in the background.  
 He was a force to be reckoned with.  
 He attempts to represent [[democracy]] 
 yet at the same time desires that youtube 
 be turned into a [[fascism|police state]].  
 Not to mention the death threats, deletion 
 of videos, and annoying the shit out of Steve Chen.

=== Declaration of war ===

=== Final Warning ===
[[Image:Argent009-finalwarning.PNG|thumb|250px|How to view the [[lulz]].]]
You can view the final warning <strike>[http://sabrael.net/ed/videos/player.swf here]</strike>[[Baleet|BALEETED!]] in the Argent009 folder, the video is named "Final Warning".
For some odd reason Argent009 seems to believe Google and YouTube will come after ED.  He does not explain why he believes that laughing at a fat guy is a criminal offense.  Google and YouTube have so far refused to defend Argent009's right not to be laughed at.

=== YourTubeCommunity ===
A lot of his [[shit]] is based around his crappy Joomla website.  [[Nobody gives a shit]]

{{quote|LOL! "MediaWiki"?|[[Argent009]]}}

== His fantasy ==
Argent009 dreams of, and [[masturbation|masturbates]] violently to, the very notion of having moderation abilities (see also: sysops/ops/moderator/forumwhore shits) or other assorted powers at [[YouTube]].  He is constantly degrading himself in vain efforts for support from his subscribers in an attempt to lead them all, though to what terrible ends he would lead them to, no one is sure. The plan seems to involve the nefarious [[YouTube Street Team]], which may or may not exist and may or not be planning a group suicide ritual in Guyana. There's just no way of knowing!

It is not unlike the avert-your-eyes brown-nosing [[Shadow42]] and [[Slowking_man]] give on [[freenode]] in their attempts to gain [[respect]] and eventual [[jews|Jewhood]].

== Seeking wealth ==
[[Image:Argent009-classaction.PNG|thumb|right|'''C'''lass '''A'''ction '''L'''awsuit, zomg.]]
Argent009 has a reputation for trying to form a class action lawsuit against various organizations, it's pretty obvious that he's just in it for the money, liek [[mediacrat]], [[amirite]]?

{{:Argent009/Class Action Lawsuit}}

Also [[internet police|international web police]] lulz.

== Argent009 is a [[LJ killers|killer]]?! ==

[[Image:Rollerpig.gif|thumb|right|Argent009 aka "RollerPig"]]

Look at him, for fuck sakes.  His agenda is to [[MySpace]] the haters [[irl]] and brutally sodomize his enemies with the tip of his mighty, mighty spear. ''He doesn't fucking care for human life.''  '''BEWARE!!!!'''

Argent009 apparently cannot even write an [http://www.amazon.com/www-ZEDO-com/dp/B00006I7EH Amazon review] without proposing violent acts against his fellow man:

<blockquote>"This site is a propogator of spyware and adware. If this is how you do business you deserve to be put out of business faster than you can say 'Chapter 13'. If you support sites like zedo.com then you support cyber-terrorism, digital theft, the destruction of private and public property and the invasion of privacy of every individual on the internet. This site should be targeted and shut down immediately! I found these so-called "REVIEWS" while hunting for a method to REMOVE Zedo's spyware intrusion on my computer after 12 different spyware removal tools failed to kill it. My next step is to kill it by reformatting my hard drive and calling a lawyer to file a lawsuit against this company. If you have been affected by Zedo's evil activities, I suggest you contact an attorney today and file a report with the Better Business Bureau. Companies like this should be shut down and their owners taken out and shot in the head!"</blockquote>

No one at Zedo could be reached for comment concerning whether or not its owners had yet been taken out and shot in the head. Nonetheless, Argent009 was reported to Amazon for his violent threats by a concerned citizen who just happened to be e-stalking him, [[lol]].

== Sockpuppets ==
Argent009 has a school of [[sockpuppets]] to approve his points.

=== vvattage ===
<center><youtube>Sa0XYJYNlyE</youtube></center>
Argent009 created a [[sockpuppet]] account on [[YouTube]] to try to mock wattagecat.  Although his VLOG was meant to instigate and offend him, it actually came off as [[lol]].  Proof that it's difficult to break the law of [[YCTAT]].  However, once our detectives caught on to him, the video was deleted, alas.

=== The Mole ===
{{Main|The Mole}}
The Mole is a squinty-eyed alter ego that argent used on his forum.  The Mole is a person who supposedly logged onto [[bantown]] has seekrit ties.

==WMD's==
Weapons of Mass Degeneration.
[[Image:Is this how i trolled.png|thumb|lol, premium account at ebaumsworld!]]
[[Image:Wwwwhhhhatttt.jpg|thumb|right|OMFGLMAOROFLOL]]

The [[E-detective|Lulz Intelligence Agency]] uncovers the [[Ted Stevens|dictator]] of the [[YouTube Street Team|YouTube Street Team's]] stockpiled weapons of mass degeneration and a full scale invasion is declared. He has refused to disarm and ejected all LUN inspectors from the [[Iraq|country]], thus leaving the ED [[Internet Military]] no choice.

==Obsession with the [[Old|ancient]]==
Like most YouTubers, Argent009 latches onto the latest [[Nornna]]-esque fad. Which just happens to be a [[Geriatric1927|79-year-old man in adult diapers, '''Geriatric1927''']], in an to-his-eyes elaborate to-all-others clumsy and embarrassing, ruse to further his [[attention whore]]ing skill set. I.e.,:
[[Image:Argent009 obsession.PNG|center|frame|This charming [[spam]]]]
[[Image:Argent009 says not spam.PNG|center|frame|Not spam?]]
[[Image:Argent009 facist.PNG|center|frame|Even random e-people agree, he's a [[Nazi]]]]
[[Image:Argent009 denies being nazi.PNG|center|frame|[[NO U]]]]

'''Source:''' http://thefates.wordpress.com/2006/08/15/geezer-virus/

[[Some argue]] that, in fact, Argent009 is perpetrating the perfect crime by [[raping]] this poor [[Disease|Alzheimer's victim]] repeatedly behind closed doors, leading to more tears shed in the shower by the victim than all the tears shed in the showers at Auschwitz.

== Scuffles with [[Wikipedo|Wikipedos]] ==
{{quote|I am Argent009, view me on YouTube, what other proof could anyone need?|Argent009 is the definition of Unwarranted Self Importance}}
[[Image:Dr_katz_chair.gif|right|thumb|Well, my [[E-psychiatrist|e-diagnosis]] is that you're a self-loathing moron with an inferiority complex who craves the acceptance and adoration of others as an authority figure]]
As reflected [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Geriatric1927 here] in the talk page for the Geriatric1927 article on [[TOW]], Argent009 does not understand the conventions/common courtesies of wikifags. 

Regarding edits that don't designate Argent009 as GeriatricBumLover1927's heir designate or whatever gayness:

''<blockquote>Whoever is editing the entry for askgeriatric.com to say he has no control over the site, stop it now, you are a bold faced liar. That is Peter's official website and he has complete control over it. I am Michael, his friend who set it up for him, none of you have any knowledge of this situation so quit your nonsense. If it's edited again I will report it.</blockquote>''

Notice how he throws around [[Power_Word:_IRL_Name|the power words]] to try and establish his credibilty? Anywho, the [[Wikipedo|pedos]] babysitting the article then go on to pee-pee slap him for his idiotic formatting and putting things like "DO NOT EDIT" next to links to his website in the links section. He then throws this temper tantrum:

''<blockquote>See Point #1, wasn't I clear enough there for you? I don't do a lot of Wiki editing. As for arguing my case better. Sorry, I wasn't aware that having the person that this Wiki article is about say "THIS IS MY OFFICIAL WEBSITE AND THIS IS MY FRIEND WHO IS DOING IT FOR ME" wasn't a valid enough arguement... As for "threats", reporting someone for messing with a wiki article, you're just plain wrong. Users have been blocked from even accessing Wikipedia for abusing it in the past and if you continue to abuse it you can be blocked. Do I need to show verifiable proof of this too?</blockquote>''

You're going to [[Internet jail]], buster!

''<blockquote>I could go on but I've proven my point as far as it needs to be. Anything you may say from here on out is worthless blithering and you should just save your breath. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by Argent009 (talk • contribs).</blockquote>''

Oh boohoo you big baby. [[PROTIP]]: [[Template:Sign|FOUR FUCKING TILDES.]] Also, he cites the [[Stephen Colbert]]/[[TOW]] drama and congress [[edit wars]] as proof that the [[internet police]] are on the case!

One last bit of irony. Here he is trying to mock the wikipedos for calling his self-appointed stewardship of GeriatricOvenOperator1927 a bunch of unverifiable bullshit:

''<blockquote>Next time I'll have him write it out in triplicate, have it notorized and delivered to the homes of everyone who uses Wikipedia for you. Adding the links (redirects, what the heck ever) was an attempt to show you the PROOF of what was said.</blockquote>''

Given the fact that he's now FILLING OUT FORMS AND HE HAS *57 OMFGWTFBBQROFL, this is sincerely, honest-to-god milk of a true lol-cow.

== Declaration of [[War]] ==
To prove his hatred of [[Jews]] and [[children]], as well as his love of [[fascism]], he has declared war on all that is good and true.

== Enjoying the publicity ==
[[Image:Argent009ad.png|center]]

== Starting over ==
Obviously overwhelmed with all the smack he talked as an [[internet tough guy]], Argent009 followed through with a final solution, to [[Deleting your Youtube Videos|Delete his youtube videos]].

== An Internets Entrepreneur ==
[[Image:Argent mousemat.jpg|thumb|right|I SELL CRAP ON THE INTERNETS]]
Argent009 needs YUO to help him stay online by buying cafepress products so he can use the $0.50 markup to finance a batcave for the Street Team

"Buy some ugly garbage from this shop and help support my habit of wasting my time on YouTube."

You heard the man, do it! And do it from:
http://www.cafepress.com/argent009

DO NOT STEAL THE IMAGES THEY ARE COPYRIGHTED

== Selling out ==
[[Image:Argent tat.jpg|thumb|guess which crippled appendage the lucky winners tattoo is going on?!?]]
As if selling his disgusting face on a T-shirt isn't enough, Argent is now trying to sell his body on [http://cgi.ebay.com/Tattoo-Advertising-Space-YouTube-LiveVideo-Your-Ad_W0QQitemZ120077314967QQihZ002QQcategoryZ102333QQcmdZViewItem ebay for advertising], you can buy a tattoo on his arm for a starting bid of a mere $10,000 or buy it now for '''$50,000''' in non-internet money. How delusional can you be to think someone will want to spend money advertising on someone who has a pathetic 600 youtube subscribers (mostly [[wattagecat]] socks) and talks about killing people on the internet, crying about being butthurt and pretending he is a NSA Agent? Great publicity for your company!

If typical Argent009 behavior ensues expect to see Argent009 claim to be sponsored by [[Google]]/[[YouTube]]/[[Steve Chen]] in the near future. Alternatively for megalulz you can cut him an Internet cheque and get [[goatse]] tattooed on his arm.

== The LiveVideo Saga ==
[[Image:Argent009-LiveVideo.png|thumb|right|Argent serial blocking and messaging general [[wattage]].]]
[[Image:Argentfucks.JPG|thumb|Argent009 and LemonHoles]]
[[Image:ArgentleavesLV.png|thumb|So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night!]]
Eventually Argent009 switched to LiveVideo. Unfortunately it was not to last, as batshit rantings against random LiveVideo users drove [[The Promised Land]] against him, and he has since gone into exile once more, searching for a place that [http://pornotube.com that will accept him].

==Re-invention==

Recently, Argent reinvented himself as a Mike Skehan clone with something called “The Ass-Hat Report”. However instead of criticizing other YouTube users, he just spends what seems like days talking about how butt hurt he is over subjects that have [[old meme|long died.]]He appears to believe that [[ED]] is now supported by YouTube in their [[Lulz|campaign of hate]], because one of his videos was deleted due to [[AIDS]] and [[fail]]. Oh, and he showed [[mudkip]] pussy. It can now be inferred Argent definitely [[Mudkip|lieks mudkips]]. Apparently he also believes ED is a cohesive organization, and that a wiki asking for donations to maintain their site is now considered internets panhandling. After dragging his butt-hurt ass across the comments sections of his videos, all of which possessed [[Flame war|rational]], [[Caps lock|well typed]] and put together arguments as to why he failed so miserably at [[teh internets]], and why he's a [[fag]] that won't just let shit go, Argent chose to take his characteristic [[Nazi|Nazi-esque]] [[final solution]] of [[Deleting your Youtube Videos|deleted his Youtube Videos]]. In another characteristic act, Argent chose to project his feelings of butt-hurt in a [[Unfunny|"this is so funny"]] video towards anyone that disagreed with him ever. He now does not allow people to embed videos, so follow this link [[for great justice]].

==Argent's rampage against MyLemonHoles==
In 2006, Argent went on a [[bantown|ban]] spree against a [[fucktard]] named MyLemonHoles who claimed to have cancer. Besides giving massive donations to [[KFC]] and [[McDonalds]], this is the only thing Argent has [[evar]] been useful for.

==[[Disregard that]]...==
After some 2 years of videomaking OTI, and taking some serious steps towards a self-induced [[HNNNNNNGGGGG|coronary]], Argent recently made a video (concerning the drama on [[VH]]) wherein he seemed to have drastically changed his perspective on internets and trolls.  Argent, someone who used to consider the internets very [[serious business]], has now seemingly changed his philosophy on trolls and his past...  

{{quote|1=There are a few people who you guys would consider "haters" that were able to teach me a few things about being a vlogger.  One of the first things is if you take yourself seriously, and you're a vlogger...you're asking for trouble.  You have to realize that if you're putting your face out here on the internet, you're an [[attention whore]], and you are [[asking for it|asking]] for people to [[flame|criticize]] everything you do.  You're ''asking'' for people to look at your videos and pick out everything you could do that could be possibly wrong, and point it out.  Why else would you be on here if you weren't a bit of an attention whore?|2=OH SHI-}}

===Why it's important===
The fact that one of the most trolled men in the history of the internet has managed to do a complete 180, tends to suggest that [[trolling]] not only works, but more accurately that it has the power to even help the target in the longrun.  [[renetto|Some]] [[Danielspengies|others]], [[Pigslop|though]], [[smugfag|seem]] [[Paul Fetch|doomed]] [[Battim|to]] [[Casey Nunez|repeat]] [[Tom Serson|history]] [[TheRedskull|forever]].  

==Current==
Argent's been a little inactive for most of [[2008]], but with the advent of [[Vloggerheads]], and amidst the hub bub over their [[TOS]], [[copyright]] issues, constant bawwwfest about [[trolls]], and [[renetto]]'s shitty running of the website, he made some serious progress in [http://www.vloggerheads.com/video/video/show?id=2225835%3AVideo%3A331476 trolling renetto].
