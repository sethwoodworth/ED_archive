<b>Greg Solomon</b> is a long-winded internet jackass-of-all-trades, and the ''christpunching'' arch-enemy of [[Renetto]]. Thinner, yet just as [[boring]], Greg Solomon continues to vie for Renetto's coveted spot as the 10th biggest [[asspie]] on [[YouTube]]. Armed with a fake pair of Oakley's, a hat to cover his bald head, and the obnoxious habit of speaking of himself in the third person, he sets out to topple Lex Luthor for the Championship Belt of the WWF. [[Some argue]] that Mr. Solomon currently owes Renetto a grand and his precious video camera. Greg, is also a paramourator of the ''black'' '''cock'''. Greg solomon is known to strangle kittens when not on [[YouTube]], and it notable for taking [[theredskull]] seriously.


== Greg Solomon, [[internet lawyer|Internet Lawyer]] ==

One of Greg Solomon's first YouTube adventures was reaching into [[Zenarcher]]'s ass and ripping out his spleen. Zenarcher had 
posted a video about copyright law, [[copyright infringement]], and how he was well within his rights to [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atCF5kyR6J4 post videos on YouTube from his mother's basement]. Greg Solomon went [[apeshit]], and immediately broke into a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9rA1UXTlDs double] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0DcOTRC6KY suplex] of verbosity that would make even Matlock [[shit|soil]] his Depends. 

== Enemies of Greg Solomon ==

In his relatively short YouTube career, Greg Solomon has managed to piss off 89.37% of all YouTube users. Here is a small sample of people who currently [[hate]] Greg Solomon:

== The Renetto/Solomon Wars ==
[[Image:Solomon_plays_poker.jpg|thumb|i gots an ace beeyatch!!!!]]
[[Image:Solomon_fan_pic.jpg|thumb|It's rumored that Greg Solomon is a card carrying member of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_pistols Pink Pistols]]]
Renetto apparently started this drama by making a video called [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC_K0OI-wWI Let's Play Some Poker], where he gave the finger to everyone and claimed that he had some inside connection to Youtube execs [[Azn|Steve Chen]] and [[Wapanese|Chad Hurley]], ala [[Argent009]]-style. Renetto eluded that he would pay out $100.00 to anyone that could [[proof|prove]] him wrong. After several responses ensued, Renetto made another video where his "proof" turned out to be [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-yrsxwW0G0| some crap that he had written on his hands]. Like [[hookers and blow]], Greg Solomon takes his [[poker]] very seriously, and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g4pMwS-9hg this really chapped Greg Solomon's nuts]. Of course, lengthy video diatribes ensued.

In the end, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPDS43jxtik Renetto produced the emails from Mary Rose and Steve Chen], instantaneously knocking Greg Solomon's [[dick]] in the dirt, and rendering him one of the biggest [[lolcow]]s in YouTube history. Strangely though, these emails stated how [[YouTube]] was "watching and caring about what went on in 'the community'", but apparently they didn't care ''enough'' about this [[crap]] to speak for themselves.

Not content with just pissing off thousands of people, Renetto further aggravated the situation by making some statement about 
blowing something up on a plane, giving clear indication that [[JEWS DID WTC|Renetto did WTC]]. One of Renetto's viewers demanded an apology 
from him. Drunk on his own [[internet celebrity]], instead of an apology, he offered yet another smarmy [[THE POWER OF ONLINE VIDEO COMMUNICATION|video]]. 
Unsatisfied with just one battle, Renetto called out Greg Solomon again, re-invigorating one of the biggest YouTube pee-pee sword fights of 2006.

When Renetto issued his "Flag me, I dare you" challenge, Greg Solomon through down the gauntlet. He issued the 
"[[Spam]] me, I dare you" challenge, while also threatening to bone Renetto's wife in the ass and pour [[Cillit bang]] into her gaping
bunghole. A series of [[tl;dr|tl;dw]] videos ensued, ultimately ending with Renetto pussing out and making some half-assed apology.  Follow along with [[fail|epic]] battle here:
