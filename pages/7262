'''Saul Sugerman''' is the patron saint of drama and [[Shit nobody cares about|pointless edit wars]] on the [http://www.daviswiki.org/Front_Page Davis Wiki], a wiki for the small college town of Davis, California.  Notably, he insists on enforcing [[NPOV]] on Daviswiki, a non-NPOV wiki.  Also, nothing makes him more enraged than Scandinavian furniture being sold at affordable prices in an assemble-it-yourself manner.  As such, he has mounted a major campaign on Daviswiki to portray [[Ikea]] as the Devil, claiming that buying from them supports [http://www.daviswiki.org/IKEA?action=diff&date2=1135271536&date1=1135270920 eating Jewish babies].  The local [[Ikea]] has not even been built yet.

His contributions on the Daviswiki led to epic [[edit war| edit trench-warfare]] and the creation of the first ever [http://www.daviswiki.org/Talk%3aCost_Plus_World_Market?action=recall&date=1111525712 talk page] on that wiki.  More recently, he has been pestering people about the content of the [http://www.daviswiki.org/IKEA Ikea page] on its  [http://www.daviswiki.org/IKEA/Talk talk page].  Sugerman doesn't like to [http://www.daviswiki.org/IKEA/Talk?action=diff&date2=1134889578&date1=1134880987 check his facts], leading others to observe "Dude, your ass must be SORE after pulling so much untruth out of it."

He is a firm believer that wikis are [[serious business]], and he [http://www.daviswiki.org/SaulSugarman?action=diff&date2=1118746660&date1=1118745792 doesn't fear you] (though this was deleted, so maybe now he does?).  There is also an entire [http://www.daviswiki.org/SaulSugarman%3aComments page] dedicated to people arguing with him.

Some believe that SaulSugerman was created by the radioactive fallout and furtive sexual exploits of the [[Daviswiki Deepthroat / Fingercuffs Incident]].  Sugerman's offspring [[MatthewKeys]] only creates drama on his own vanity page, but he's still learning.
