Many of us have got drunk and made a complete tit of ourselves at polite gatherings. Gordon Bennett actually held the world record. [[Seriously]].

=The Man, The Legend=

Dearly beloved, in the 19th Century people were leading the damned boring life. There was no [[Tumbles the Stairdragon|Tumbles]] weeping for cocaine whilst simultaneously eating his sunglasses and cartwheeling majestically down our stairwells. There were no [[Hepkitten|Hepkittens]] passing out nude on our lawn tables, and no [[Joseph Evers|Josephs]] to punch our girlfriends and attempt hilariously explosive self-destruction at our conventions.

Only one man had the vision and the balls to stand proud and say "No - THERE SHALL BE [[LULZ]]." Newspaper magnate and proto-dramacrat, James Gordon Bennett the ultimate douche.

==It Was The [[Lulz]] Of Times, It Was The Frunz Of Times==

Before we continue, it should perhaps be pointed out Bennett's shenanigans would barely raise an eyebrow amid the Sunday morning fug of regret on [[irc|#ed]]. However, these were dark times; in those days ED was called The Guiness Book of World Records, and lulz pretty much consisted of finding people who could bounce a paddle ball for fifty hours or were unusually fat or ugly and pointing it out to the world at large. (Oh yeah, it's a whole new world now.)

In these bleak times when using the wrong soup spoon was held on a par with [[raep]], Bennett would stride into restaurants and yank the tablecloths out from every table which he passed. Like a stage magician, only without the bit where all the food and drink stays on the table. He would then take out a huge wad of [[Jew Gold|cash]] for the lost food and dry cleaning bills, and sit down to order his food.

Thus, the history books already recorded that Bennet was full of win. Regular win, obviously; epic win would have been getting the customers to apologize and pay the bills themselves. Nonetheless, he was well established as a [[lulzy]] son of a bitch. However, it was one fateful night at a party thrown by his hoity-toity socialite wife-to-be Caroline May. Bennet arrived about as [[Drunk|physically refreshed]] as it is possible for a human being to be, staggered through the guests apparently unaware of his surroundings, whipped out his [[cock|majesty]] and proceeded to mistake the fireplace for a urinal. This caused his fiancee to shriek the now-immortal words:

==Aftermath==

According to history, May broke off the engagement and Bennett was forced to flee to [[France]]. In actual fact he told her to gb2kitchen and she was lucky to escape [[domestic violence|a horsewhipping]]. Bitch tells me I can't piss in my own fireplace, get what coming to her, ya dig? The Guiness Book of World Records officially acknowledged Bennet as the [[EFG]] of his time, awarding him the prestigous "Worst Faux Pas" award (the 1890s equivelant of the Vox Dramatica prize). Receiving it he announced "My work here is done," and set off across the English channel to troll the [[French|cheese-eating surrendermonkeys.]]

The phrase "Gordon Bennett" was forever immortalised as the "WTF R U DOIN" of its era, and can still be heard echoing like song from the lips of the funny computer from Red Dwarf and people trying really, really hard to be British.
