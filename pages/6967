'''UPDATE! SITE IS BACK ONLINE! MAN YOUR CANNONS BROTHERS!'''
'''Revolution Muslim''' is a [[internets|website]] where closeted [[terrorists]] sit and discuss their revolution in the name of [[Allah]].  However, unlike other [[towelhead]]s, they don't have the balls to [[jihad]] against the [[Personal Army|American military]], so they act as [[internet tough guys]].  Revolution Muslim received much [[hacking|attention]] from [[Anonymous]] for making Matt Stone and Trey Parker bleep out [[Muhammad]]'s name in [[South Park]].

== What's known ==

As of now, very little is known about Revolution Muslim's website.  [[Some argue|It is thought that]] the servers that host the Revolution Muslim website have had their [[DDoS|priorities shifted and their resources redistributed]] for other customers.  However, a few things are known...

For example, their e-mail address is (was) revolutionmuslim@gmail.com

== Warning to Matt Stone and Trey Parker ==

Revolution Muslim is well known for its [[butthurt|dissatisfaction]] with South Park's depiction of Islam.  Like most [[lie|reasonable]] groups, Revolution Muslim decided to express its [[offended|outrage]] over the 201st episode of the program in the following statement:

{{quote|We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show. This is not a threat, but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them.|Abu Talhah Al-Amrikee, of Revolution Muslim}}
Trying to mask their threat as helpful advice, Revolution Muslim forced censorship down the throats of all who watched the episode of South Park.  Anonymous, hating censorship (and everything else), quickly [[trolling|rose to the occasion]] and [[pwnt|put Revolution Muslim on the right path]].

==Anonymous's video response==

==Dox==
 
At the writing of this article, Revolution Muslim's website is [[lulz|still down]].  However, a cursory glance at Google in a search for the website provides the phone number (718)312-8203.  The area code is assigned to the New York City area.  New York City is well known for its pizza, so Anons should consider treating them to [[raid|pizza deliveries]].  Just remember, no pork products.

The group's Facebook page also indicates that they have used PalTalk before for informational meetings.  On April 1st, 2010, Masjid Syed Qutb in the Islam section of Paltalk is listed.  No other events have been planned, but Anons should be on the lookout.

Zach Chesser aka Abu Talhah Al-Amrikee was the guy who originally posted the twitter post about warning South Park about retaliation. “May Allah kill Matt Stone and Trey Parker and burn them in Hell for all eternity. They insult our prophets Muhammad, Jesus, and Moses…”

==Revolution Islam==

A few days after the south park incident a "concerned citizen" made a website called Revolution Islam. The site was a deliberate troll attempt at mohammed which worked and pissed off the butthurt muslims. They demanded the site to be taken down with out any sense of irony. [[File:Mohammed-gay.jpg|right|thumb|Revolution Islam site]]

==Note==
الله هو كلب خنزير means "Allah is a Pig Dog" and is one of the most insulting things you can say to them.

Remember, they do have a Paltalk that is announced on the blog link posted below.  You can ask them questions, and even though the comments are monitored, overload the system.

For extra [[lulz]], project irony.  As much as [[Anons]] hate sucking up to [[the Man]], report the RevolutionMuslim blog as a hate site with Blogger's [[tool]].  Censorship for those who want censorship.  Anons, do not forgive.  Do not forget.  Make them expect you.

==What you can do==

Make sure their server [[DDoS|no longer operates]].
