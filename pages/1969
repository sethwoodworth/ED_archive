'''DMT''', short for '''[[Shit nobody cares about|N,N-Dimethyltryptamine]]''', is the most [[win|hardcoar]] psychedelic drug known to man. While DMT can be found in many plants including blades of grass and your [[Brain|pineal gland]], the [[Meth|crystallized]] or powdered forms that get you high are [[The Google|easy to obtain]] and affordable if you're willing to [[Buttsecks|buttfuck]] your mind. However, if you are a [[Chemistry|chemist]], you can extract enough DMT from grass to trip many balls.  Alternatively you can look it up on teh [[google]] and extract it with pool chemicals, a few buckets and a turkey baster.  The effects last from seven to ten minutes.  Many people who have taken DMT report seeing [[Mexico|aliens]], and when asked to describe the [[Faggot|aliens]], all describe the same aliens.  The most common ways to do DMT are smoking or snorting.  After people do DMT, they will forever think that they are the shit because they found, paid for, and ingested the most ridiculous psychedelic on [[Scientology|Teegeeack]], when in reality [[You|EVERYONE]] has tripped on DMT before.  DMT is a natural chemical in the human body and is what causes dreams.  Every time you go to sleep and start hitting REM sleep, you trip balls for 2 hours.  DMT is also released in mass quantities when one is about to [[an hero|die]], so the [[Jenkem|easiest and cheapest]] way to attain DMT and trip is to [[an hero|kill yourself]] right now.


If you live in the black person, have access to a shaman and are [[batshit insane]], then you may like to try a refreshing beverage alternative to smoking or snorting DMT. This delicious drink is called [[Joseph Evers|Ayahuasca]] and is for those who find [[LSD]] 'a bit vanilla'. Some of its more positive effects are the ability to see [[over 9000|millions]] of [[Mudkips]] along with the likelihood of explosive [[diarrhea]] and [[puke|vomit]] that would put [[tubgirl]] to shame.

There was a declension of gnosis that proved to me in a moment that right here and now, one quanta away, there is raging a universe of active intelligence that is transhuman, hyperdimensional, and extremely alien"|[[Stoner|Terence McKenna]] ([http://deoxy.org/t_thc.htm sauce])}}

==5-MeO-DMT==

'''5-Methoxy-dimethyltriptamine''' is the [[Chin-chan|ugly sister]] of DMT. It can easily be obtained [[online]] because of its legal status, or found in many natural sources like various plants and toads. If DMT makes you feel like you're being catapulted into the center of the universe and seeing alternate dimensions, 5-MeO-DMT makes you feel like you're being catapulted into a black hole or a meat grinder. All of your friends who say they've done DMT are lying and they've really done 5-MeO-DMT.

==Colorado River Toad==
It's been said Bufo alvarius, also known as the Colorado river toad or the sonoran desert toad, is a big, fat brown toad that lives in the sonoran desert or the rivers of Colorado. The venom milked from the glands can be dried and smoked because it contains bufotenin and small amounts of 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine. Orally taking the venom ("licking toads") is dangerous because fucktards don't know that there are cardiotoxic (kills your heart you fucking moron) substances in the venom that are only active orally. But you'll probably be ok because...
