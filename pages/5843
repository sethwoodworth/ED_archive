A common lie added to a [[forum]] or [[journal]] post to indicate that the author is about to make a mindbogglingly [[racist]] statement, or after they already did.

**Lul later post found while trawling on stormfront.org- Soldier of Sweden: For example, I am 100% Swedish and this makes me very proud, so while I have great respect for fellow whites, I couldn't imagine letting somebody into my family who wasn't also full Swedish. I realize that may be a bit extreme, but seeing as my family is 100% Swedish, it gives me a concrete racial identity and I love that. How do you guys feel?

**"These Goddamn diaper-headed mother fuckers, don't know who they're fucking with. They want to go back to the Stone Ages, fine we'll blow their camel-fucking asses back to where they came from. Not that I'm a racist, but fuck'em okay? Any man who is so afraid of a women that he tries to deny them an education, or humiliate them beyond belief. Maybe all the men were jealous of the women, because if you noticed, none of the men have any teeth, I'm sure they did that for a reason, so they can give better head. They don't want any women around doing it better."

A more complicated variation of "not racist," this one involves

#Beginning a sentence with "Anyway I can't be racist because..."
#appending any of these excuses:
## "my great grandad was from (some [[nigra]] country)"
## "[[I have a lot of|I have a]] (insert minority here) friend"
## "my boyfriend/girlfriend is (insert minority here)"
## "I called him a 'nigga', not a 'nigger'"
## "I'm [[Christian]]" 
## "I'm a pacifist" (no really)
## "I'm [[Irish]]"
## "I'm not even white"
## "as a longtime [[Mac]] user..."
## "as a devout [[Fag]]..."
## "I said so"
## "I'm majoring in Liberal Arts"
## "I admire the work of [[Woll_Smoth|Will Smith]]"
## "that's what's so insane about this"
## "Libertarians are incapable of being racist"
## "I bought a coloured TV"
## "[[Chris-chan|I'm 1/16 Cherokee]]"
## "I hate them for the way they smell, not because they are subhumans."
## "I vote Democrat" or "I voted for Obama"
## "I love watermelon"
## "I had [[secks|fucked]] a [[fucktard|fucktarded]] black person
Remember that the more effort spent in convincing someone you are not racist, the more likely it is you are, in fact, [[racist]].

==Exception==
Granted, because the loony left will often interpret the most innocent statements as racist, kneejerk [[liberals]] will sometimes use this statement to make it clear to the [[retarded]] that they are not in fact making a racist statement. They're wasting their time, of course. 
An example of such a conversation follows:

[[Liberal guilt|Guilty liberal]]: Sushi originated in [[Japan]]

Crazy [[leftard]]: RACIST! 

[[Liberal guilt|Guilty liberal]]: Oh God I'm sorry. I'm not racist, but sushi really did originate in Japan. 

Crazy [[leftard]]: ONLY RACISTS SAY "I'M NOT RACIST!" DON'T YOU GET IT!!!!! 

[[Liberal guilt|Guilty liberal]]: Oh God, you're right! Should I sign up for sensitivity training, or just off myself right now?
