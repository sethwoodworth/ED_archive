Back Orifice
'''[[Goatse|Back Orifice]]''' is a program created by the [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] to let them moar easily h4x0r j00r b0x0r. It consists of two pieces: a server part that installs when you open that email from Grandma entitled "FLUFFY BUNNY PICS WEBSITE #56" but see a bunch of [[1337|gibberish]] instead, and a client part that someone runs on another computer and uses to [[pwn]] you. It runs on port 31337 (lol get it?). Ur [[Dox|infoz]] promptly lay in the hands of the [[Skript_kiddies|evildoers]]. 

Because it was created before [[9/11|the world changed]], it is [[Fact|widely assumed]] that Back Orifice was a major player in the hijacking of Oceanic Flight 815.

The new version of Back Orifice, designed in 2006, is designed more as a [[FuckU-FuckMe|Remote Administration Tool]], or RAT. All this "administration" is bullshit, RATs are only used to screw with people. They main feature of the new Back Orifice is a keylogger, used to <s>read ''everything'' you type and steal all your shit</s> look at you while you [[sick fuck|fap to CP]]. Other funny shit commonly found in RATs is stuff like freezing the mouse and turning off the keyboard.
