Prince, the artist formerly known as Prince, [[shit nobody cares about|the artist formerly known as the artist formerly known as Prince]], and the artist formerly known as [[Image:Princesymbol.png]] '''IS HERE TO RECLAIM THE INTERNET''' that he says is his by noble birthright.. '''This just in''' [http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/thatsreallyweek/100156/july-5-11-this-is-what-it-sounds-like-when-the-internet-cries| Prince declares the internet over]

[[Al Gore]] has made comment that he's ready and prepared to defend his invention against Prince's 'tubes d'état.

Prince's face is '''[[Serious Fucking Business]]'''. He has recently declared an [[E-Jihad]] on all images, [[tattoo]]s, and anything that looks remotely like him, including the [[jesus|Shroud of Turin]] and [[Goatse]]. He is planning to sue all black persons, [[Will Smith]], and the continent of [[Africa]] for having melanin and eating [[KFC]].


== Career Overview ==

Much like his second cousin twice removed [[Barack Hussein Obama]], Prince is a [[Ann Coulter|halfrican]] split between those of nigra and [[white]] descent. His great ancestor was relative to [[slave|Sally Hemmings]], and in spite of his celebrity status the Jefferson family still tell him "[[Wrong Location Nigger]]" when he shows up for family reunions. Prince is still suspected to be responsible for the [[Y2K]] devastation which he had predicted back in the [[80s]], when [[BBS]] was what still passed for an [[internet]]s connection.

[[Tay Zonday]]'s musical hero, Prince was the first artist to perform a rain dance as a form of popular [[music]]. However, due to overwhelming levels of [[faggotry]] and [[GRIDS]], Prince's rain was [[gay|purple]] rather than [[jenkem|chokklit]]. He is in the closet on [[at least 100]] different [[batshit]] levels, ranging from his obvious homosexuality to [[bestiality]] and beyond. If anyone knows what it sounds like when doves cry, it is Prince, who found out when he tried to stick his [[penis]] inside of one. After sampling the sound of the [[butthurt|dove's reaction]], he put it to a drum machine and it became his biggest hit.

At the peak of his popularity, Prince was often compared to singer [[Michael Jackson]], although unlike Jacko, Prince was not a pedophile. Regardless of how hard he'd try to be one.

A [[internet lawsuit|lawlsuit]]? Over MY fan site? It may be more likely than you think. Prince has declared a mighty war on all content containing his lordly image, meaning that middle-aged women and [[fgt]]s everywhere will be seeing their websites closed like a [[habbo|Swedish swimming pool]].

Prince has hired the [[WEB SHERIFF]] to scour the tubes, [[SEAKING]] images and content that may contain his face, hands, fingerprints, saliva, penis, faeces, semen, air he may have breathed, water that at one time was his piss, and any [[NO BINARIES|binaries]] he may have interacted with. What Prince [[Bitches don't know|doesn't know]] is that he's sparing the entire internet and world at large every single eye-molesting [[Geocities]] site dedicated to worshipping his [[herpes]]-infested [[dong]]. 

The [[Jewtube]]s are also off-limits, Prince has declared, so that [[noone]] can watch him sing about naked girls wearing [[linux|red hats]]. Several accounts have allegedly been [[baleeted]] by his [[leet]] h4x0r rent-a-cops.

{{quote|THIS CHANNEL WAS CREATED TO SILENTLY PROTEST PRINCE AND HIS '''NAZI-LIKE''' BEHAVIOR ON YouTube|[http://www.youtube.com/user/SilentPrinceProtest SilentPrinceProtest]|invoking [[Godwin's Law]] in [[ALLCAPS]]}}
<br>

It is rumored that he is trying to figure out a method by which he can copyright the word Prince itself to extract several thousand years of back-pay from the [[Chav]]s for their flagrant abuse of integrating his product with their [[government]] and [[history]]. He  has also been sighted going door to door in the [[Amerikkka]]n midwest, demanding totals exceeding $[[9000]] from every housewife who thinks about him in the shower while they grind against the flexible massage extension.

Prince has also threatened to sue [[The Pirate Bay]]. Get in line, [[douche]]bag.


==Prince Fans United==

And what could all of this super cereal hijacking of his Lordship bring about? A war between Prince '''and his own moronic fanbase'''. 

Yes, they've formed a website to fight back against the man they [[love]] and cherish the most. The site endorses websites such as [http://www.princefams.com Princefams.com], [http://www.housequake.com Housequake.com], and [http://www.Prince.org Prince.org] which have all received threats of internet lolsuit for sucking his [[e-penis]].


== Prince's Fanbase ==

Consists wholly of [[gay]]s, middle aged women, [[gay]]s, men with male pattern baldness, [[gay]]s, and [[your mom]]. Prince's fan base are the kind of people who think [[hippie|patchouli]] smells good and actually listen to Barry White when they lay down some white wimmenz. They are currently exploding with [[butthurt]] and [[drama]] over his edict by birthright to pwn their [[nostalgia]] orgy websites.

[[Forum]]s on every PFU-affiliated website are discussing the issue, but no visible [[troll]]ing has taken place as of yet, possibly because noone really gives a flying [[fuck]].


==Fan Lyrics In Protest==

<pre>
Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I liked to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys
Who were up to no good
Startin making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suite case and send me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air Living like?
Hmmmmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, wine all that
Is Bel-Air the type of place they send this cool cat?
I don't think sow
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightening, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I can say this cab is rare
But I thought 'Now forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

==JULY 5-11: The Internets is Over.==
[http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/thatsreallyweek/100156/july-5-11-this-is-what-it-sounds-like-when-the-internet-cries/ OH SHI-]

[[Last thursday]] Prince [[failed|tried]] to create the biggest [[forced meme]] [[evar]] by saying that the [[internet]] is [[dead|over]]. [[Obviously]], this caused one of the biggest [[lollercaust]]s that [[history]] has ever seen. [[Some argue]] that this may become a [[IRL|reality]], but only if Prince [[redundancy|keeps doing what he's doing]].


==Lulz come quick, Lulz come in a hurry. There are [[trolls]] in the temple tonight!==
Trolling Prince? Can one troll Prince? The answer is yes, but this will generate [[lulz]] at a minimal level. The reason? Prince will Jew making you poor and your mother suck cock for a nickle or a hit of blow. [[Some argue]] that because of his actions towards the [[internets]], Prince ,himself, is trolling the internet. It all points to the truth. Consider the following, You can try to troll Prince [[IRL]] or [[IRC]]. However, in the end, your father loves his music and your mother rushes upstairs to the shower to masturbate to him while listening to Darling Nikki (women really love that song). [[Truth|Your parents conceived your pathetic ass while listening to his music. With that being said, your mom pretended she was being fucked by Prince rather than your dad making Prince your real dad.]] People believe that he rages at this whole ordeal of not being paid his money by the tubes, but this is in fact the complete opposite. Prince clearly has us all fooled into thinking he is [[butthurt]]. In actuality, the evidence points that it is the internets, including his fanbase, are the ones who are BAWWWW-ING. Prince is filthy rich, and making women climax at his presence as as selling platinum albums is just the [[cream]] (Yet another hit song). Prince's true intention is not for the money. Prince is like any other troll, but unlike the vast majority of trolls, Prince can actually get laid. This explains why he would [[trolling|go around in public wearing panties, perform was a penis-resembling guitar, and have 98.5% of his music about sex]]. Prince does it for the lulz. This makes Prince the greatest [[troll]] in the music industry.

DID YOU KNOW...

...that in his spare time, Prince is a regular on [[4chan]]?

...that Prince was a [[/b/|/b/tard]] until [[newfags]] killed it? Prince also hates newfags.

...that our [[fag|man]] [[moot]] is a fan of his?

...that Prince has always exhibited behavioral qualities of a troll? He has always been the harbringer of controversy (IRL and in his film debut, Purple Rain)

...on a related note, he made a song called "[[Controversy]]" for his 1981 hit album called "[[Controversy]]", which caused mass amount of [[butthurt]] and, you guessed it, [[Controversy]]?

...that there was no Parental Advisory label on music until 1984 when [[Al Gore]]'s wife [[concerned mother| Tipper]], caught their daughter masturbating to "Darling Nikki" and pushed for that bill. [[Epic|You have Prince to thank for that.]]

...that Prince can actually [[divide by zero]]?

...that Prince can actually [[triforce]]?

...that Prince knows [[your mom]]?

...that Prince is a fan of [[Boxxy]]?

...that Prince is more bad ass than [[Chuck Norris]]?

...dis cat could ball, man!

{{quote|Why don't you purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka?| [[pwn|Prince to the internet]]}}

{{quote|I did it for the lulz| Prince telling the truth. Indeed a true man of honor}}


[[Image:Blue screen of death.gif|thumb| Prince also invented the [[Windows|blue screen of death]] to troll Windows users. The evidence is in the lyrics of his 1984 song, "Computer Blue" from his best selling album "Purple Rain".]]




[[Image:FFFUUUU computer blue.png|thumb|left|[[that fucking cat|THAT FUCKING PRINCE!]]]]

Exhibit A: Excerpt of Lyrics to Computer Blue

"Where is my love life?
Where can it be?

There must be something wrong with the machinery
Where is my love life?
Tell me, where has it gone?

Somebody please please tell me what the hell is wrong
Till I find the righteous one
Computer blue

Till I find the righteous one
Computer blue"


Analysis: The evidence is clear. Not only has predicted Y2K but also geniously the infamous blue screen of death. To add lulz into the [[lollercoaster]], he has also told the story by means of mocking a typical [[basement dweller]] not being able to go on something awful or look at rule 34 because of this PC issue. Because of this, this only further supports the fact that Prince is the troll and a damn good one too. Perhaps, the Prince of trolling.


Want further reassurance? In the 90's, Prince substituted his name for [[Image:Princesymbol.png]]. This symbol is known as the love symbol or [[loev]]. Lulz ensued (as always) when [[fantards]] and left tards alike, raged as to what was his name. Prince, like the epic troll that he is, sat back and watched the shit storm he deliberately brewed as people engaged in the biggest flame war of the decade. This lead to most of his music videos of the 90's to be labeled "The artist formerly known as Prince" acronym TAFKAP (note: exclude the letters "T", one of the letter "A"'s, and the letter "K", what do you get? Trolling at it's best). This too was unsatisfactory as people (fans alike), to further bitch on the fact his new name was [[long cat|tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong]] to pronounce or spell. [[Lies|Prince finally had enough lulz for one life time]], and showed a [[troll's remorse]] for the [[over 9000|thousands]] of lives lost during the war. When questioned about this, Prince replied simply with these words..
