'''Powerpoint Presentations''' are a series of [[image macro]]s made less informative by replacing all the [[kitten]]s with stock report figures. Generally used by people who wouldn't know a computer if it raped them in the ass, to show their worthless colleagues pieces of worthless information, in an effort to somehow justify their pointless existence as a pathetic office drone with nothing to show for their lives whatsoever. With flying text and clipart.

Powerpoint has been known to cause [[AIDS|herpes, genital warts, heart failure, gum disease and pancreatic cancer]].

OpenOffice.org provides an [[shit|open source]] alternative to Powerpoint, but is just as [[fail|useless]].

If you are faced with the prospect of sitting through a shitty Powerpoint presentation, here's some things you can do to lighten up the mood for everyone.

* Yell "Go back a slide black person, I wasn't done reading that shit" every time the slide is moved forward.
* [[Hackers on steroids|Haxor]] your teacher/coworker/boss's laptop and replace all images in the presentation with [[mudkips]] and/or [[goatse]].
* [[an hero|Kill yourself]].
