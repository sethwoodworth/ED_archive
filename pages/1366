'''''Castlevania''''' is a [[video game]] series that started out as a [[Mario]] [[pwn|pawning]] action-adventure for the [[NES]]/[[SNES]]. Over the years, however, the newer Castlevania games slowly succumbed to the tsunami waves of anorexic [[13 year old]] [[animu|anime]] [[fantard|fanboys]], and [[emo]] furfags who never even heard of the original series. Games like Castlevania: Judgement appeals more to the [[Sonichu]] fanbase.

== The Story ==
All games in the series consist of one of these two plots:

'''Before 1997'''<br>
Castlevania games before 1997 were done in arcade style. It opens with a vampire hunter in front of Dracula's castle.  Then a bunch of levels where the player gets knocked off of platforms over 9000 times by Medusa heads.  The player proceeds to kill  bats, mummies, Frankenstein monsters, [[Niggers]], and Death before fighting Dracula.

'''After 1997'''<br>
After 1997 all the games became non-linear and got a ton of RPG elements are added. The vampire hunting industry gets taken over by transexuals clad in name-brand fashion acessories. Players alternate going back and forth through a castle collecting a large amount of cool weapons and [[shit nobody cares about|useless crap]] needed to kill Dracula. Also, if you'd like to shit bricks, Alucard spelled backwards is Dracula.  People will feel the need to point this out for over 9000 years after the release of the game.

''A note about non-linearity in Castlevania - The post SoTN games really are linear, because they are just a series of fetch quests to get items and beat bosses and fornicate with other men so that whichever Belmondo you are controlling can have the [[twilight|story]] pushed forward.  If they really were non-linear, you could just go kill Dracula and then go outside to find women to have sex with.  Then again, you're reading ED, so you might as well just play Julius mode and avoid the embarrassment.''

== The Games ==
[[Image:Castlevan1game.gif|thumbnail|NES Castlevania.  That's right, [[LOL WUT|in the 80s zombies were pink.]]]][[Image:Sotn1.gif|thumbnail|Symphony of the Night]][[Image:CastleL.jpg|thumbnail|H-H-H-HOLY CROSS]]
*'''Castlevania'''<br> 
The first of the [[shitstorm]] of games yet to come. It consists of getting you getting knocked off ledges and dying. After struggling to beat the game you unleash hard-mode where your are CONSTANTLY [[zerg rush|zerg rushed]] with as many fucking bats as possible. The ability to change direction in the middle of a jump did not exist, causing most players to uncontrollably <font color="red">'''RAGE'''</font>. The next 3 million games are like this, each with slowly improving graphics.

You play as Simon Belmont, a Vampire Slayer who uses a leather whip and other kinky [[Catholic]] sex toys to rape 8-bit skeletons. The Bosses of the game are of Dracula (obviously) and your standard B-Movie monsters like Mummies and Frankenstein.<br>

*'''Castlevania 2:  Simon's Quest'''<br> 
This game exists solely to sell copies of [[Shit nobody cares about|Nintendo Power]] to tell people what to do with the red crystal.  In an attempt to revolutionize all gaming, Konami [[fail|tried their best]] to integrate RPG elements into the sequel to their Medusa-head-dodging simulator.  Of course, they fuck it all up and it has all the usual problems of [[AIDS|JRPGs]]; poor translation, useless leveling system to pad out gameplay, random uses for random items, and an attempt at a unique THE MORNING SUN HAS VANQUISHED THE HORRIBLE NIGHT.

*'''Castlevania 3:  [[faggotry|Dracula's Curse]]'''<br> 
Realizing the [[abortion]] they had produced, Konami went back and shuffled around the sprites from the first Castlevania.  They then added some new characters, most notably [[Fag|Alucard]].  Other than that, it's the same game as the first one, starting a tradition that the series would reset with Symphony of the Night.

*'''Super Castlevania IV'''<br> 
In order to appease [[you|12-year-olds]] who wanted to see Castlevania in glorious 16-bit color, Konami [[serious business|messed around]] in their [[basement dweller|labs]] for awhile and pooped out the best side-scrolling Castlevania to date.  Seen by some fans to be a remake of the original, it is really Konami trolling its fans because every side-scrolling Castlevania is a remake of the original.

*'''Symphony of the Night'''
The sprites are cooler and the game system has been RPG-ified. The story line is the epitome of failure, but the gameplay is so great you won't give a fuck. There are shitloads of weapons, items, and other crap to run around with making the game a lot less boring. You play as vampire named [[Fag|Alucard]] and plow through the castle to find the owner is a Belmont. You receive Magic Beer Goggles to find out he's [[date rape|controlled]] by the evil lawyer, [[Cock|Shaft]]. This creates loophole in his contract allowing Dracula to be revived ''again''.

*'''Castlevania and Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness'''<br> 
Amazed at the continued success of the least innovative series to date, Konami decided it was time to troll their fans and see if there was something they wouldn't buy.  It took them two tries on the N64, but they succeeded.

*'''Castlevania Chronicles'''<br> 
First released for some Japanese computing machine in 1993, it was later released on the PS1 in 2001, scaring [[virgin|long-time fans]] that the series was reverting to its prior suck.  It's a remake of a remake, or maybe just a remake of the first game directly....oh hell, it's that game again.

*'''Lament of Innocence'''
After fucking up Castlevania 64 they decided to give another go at a 3D Castlevania in the series. The end product wasn't half bad.  It wasn't half good, either.

Basically you play as Leon Belmont, a knight who fought in the Crusades who has to save his [[hoe]] from some [[ginger]] vampire named Walter. [[irony|To make his whip strong enough to fuck Walter he has to murder his wife with it]]. He does so and it creates teh whip "Vampire Killer". You go back after Walter and kill him, then there is a crazy twist revealing how Dracula came to be.

*'''[[DeviantART|Portrait of Ruin]]'''
Probably the [[fact|worst]] Castlevania ever made. You play as Jonathan Morris and Charlotte Aulin (Aulin meaning All-in in reference to her huge fucking vagina, the cock teasing bitch). The castle is now full of paintings/portals which lead to Egypt, England and wherever the hell they please. The Final Boss is a bald-headed fuck who paints pictures. He was just one of the many vampires to have bought Draculas real-estate after his death. To kill the final boss you must under-go training [[srsly|taught to you by a ghost]]. After you beat the game you can play as "Richiter" Belmont. The rest of the game has its share of typos.

*'''Curse of Darkness''' 
Some really weird game where you play as some retard named Hector who [[Retard|chooses to place his trust in a weird monk instead of a spiffy time traveler.]] There's also this dumb witch who's the sister of the psychotic ginger you're trying to kill the whole fucking time, I mean seriously wouldn't you stop a guy from killing your brother? but noooo, she says hes CUUURSED. Anyway, you go through the game, getting furries and fighting really weird and easy enemies, kinda like every other single castlevania game without the gathering of furries and shit. You can get alot of weapons like a light saber, a power glove, and death's scythe but you often have to sacrifice already pwnage weapons to get newer ones, which some people prefer the older ones but saved so they're fucked.
Your rival is Isaac, he's kinda like the joker but in olden times and really fucking gay with red hair. He owns Trevor belmont, then kisses him right before he finishes him off. The furry monsters comprise of some faggy fairy no ones ever gonna use because it's just for pussies, a golem thingy that can turn into a weeaboo, a gay dog-giant, a blob that kinda looks like chaos from sonic adventure and THE JUGGERNAUT, BITCH.
Then there's a black mage thing that's pretty badass but one of its last forms are some princess girl that spams stars at shit. 
Then you get a bird which is just.. A bird. One of it's forms are a mass of meat on a pair of wings.. really weird.
Then you get the devil type... innocent devil. Real creative, huh? Then, after you go through all the boring shit you fight the last boss, DRACULA. (OMG!) After Hector pusses out on killing Isaac, that weird monk faggot reveals that he's Death, and hes gonna rape your ass, right after he sends Isaac in a coffin to turn into Dracula, however that works. Then you fight death and hes the slowest most miserable fuck you could ever possibly hope to fight in a game. After you beat the game, you can go into boss rush mode for a material which you couldn't before to get the power glove which is really just t3h l33t h@x. if you use it's best special it makes a motherfucking volcano in the ground.

tl;dr: Just another Castlevania, except you summon monsters and there's a time traveller that has nothing to do with the story.

== Characters ==
<br>
'''Vampire Hunters'''<br>

*'''Leon''': The [[old|first]] member of the clan to wield the whip. He had anger issues and some very lame lines, such as [[ALL CAPS|"I'LL KILL YOU AND THE NIGHT!" and "CARVE THEM ON YOUR CURSED BODY AND PERISH!"]]. He's also emo, which is surprising, since the game took place in [[at least 100 years ago|1095 AD]], when the emo subculture was yet to befoul the world.<br><br>

*'''[[Simon Belmont|Simon]]''': The Belmont [[e-famous|everyone knows and loves]], and starred in the original, which is always the best. Konami loves him so much that they [[copypasta|recycled]] his game several times. Truly all that is man, Simon can do fucking anything with the whip. The only thing that sucks about Simon is that he can't do shit on the stairs (except in ''Super Castlevania IV''). ED hopes he kills Stephanie Meyer in the next Castlevania.<br><br>

*'''Trevor''': An [[old meme|ancestor]] of Simon.  He needed [[buttsecks|friends]] to kill Dracula.  What a pussy. He also married a [[transsexual]] [[Harry Potter|witch]]. He pops up again in one of the newer 3D games, where he does nothing but [[troll]] the player. He gets his comeuppance, however, when he's taken down and [[molest]]ed by the game's villain.<br><br>

*'''Richter''': Fought alongside [[lolicon|Maria Renard]] and [[gay|Alucard]]. He was controlled by Dracula, but only after [[buttsecks|getting his shit kicked in]] by Alucard did he come to his senses. He originally looked like [[Street Fighter 2|Ryu]], but was updated for ''Symphony of The Night'' and the ''Dracula X Chronicles'' to look like every other Belmont, with the added bonus of greasy, unkempt hair. May be related to [[You are doing it wrong|Richiter Belmont]], who you can play as in ''Portrait of Ruin''.<br><br>

*'''Julius''': A modern Belmont, Julius [[shit nobody cares about|is the most powerful Belmont to date]], and is the only one to have [[neckbeard|facial hair]], which may or may not be related to his [[buttsecks|powers]].<br><br>

[[File:Alucard CV.jpg|thumb|right|Whenever someone mentions that this is [[fact|the real Alucard]], an army of whiny [[fucktards|fanboys]] will make [[butthurt|pained rebuttals]], and claim that [[fangirl|Ayami Kojima's]] is the [[lie|real one]].]]
[[File:Slutpha.jpg|thumb|right| Left: Sypha before his sex change. Right: After sex change.]]
*'''[[bishie syndrome|Alucard]]''': The son of Dracula, and his pseudonym is Dracula spelled backwards. [[Shit nobody cares about|His real name is "Adrian Farenheit Tepes".]] [[emo|He hates his dad]], probably because he was [[raped|not given enough hugs]] as a child. In the future [[weeaboo|he pretends to be Japanese]], calling himself [[Mexico|Vagina Alucardo]].  . He is the most [[masturbate|fapped]]-to person in the series by [[faggots|fanboys]] and [[whores|fangirls]] alike, due to his [[God Mode|cool]] powers and [[gay|hawt]] looks. Suggestions have been made of just going ahead and making a game where you play as Alucard to rescue Alucard from Alucard in a castle that's made of nothing but high-resolution images of Alucard.


*'''[[gay|Soma Cruz]]''': A half-[[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] high school [[Wapanese|exchange student in Japan]] in [[future|2035]] who is supposed to be Dracula's [[ mary sue|reincarnation]], and can [[blow job|absorb]] souls from [[Furry|monsters]]. He can [[Everquest|equip souls]] to gain [[Fifty Hitler post|new attacks]] and [[Otherkin|transform]]. He is quite androgynous, only surpassed by Alucard when it comes to looking like an animu man-whore.


*'''[[slut|Sypha Belnades]]''': Sorcerer who [[fail|helped]] Trevor Belmont in Dracula's Curse. At the end of the game, he is revealed to be [[hermaphrodite|she]], and apparently [[emo|had a hard life]]. ([[Metroid|Gee, now where have I seen this before?]]) After [[faggot|IGA]] took over, and [[Konami]] granting him power to [[delete fucking everything|change everything]], Sypha and Trevor made [[buttsecks|babies]] and gave birth to new [[mary sue|super-powerful]] [[faggots|Belmonts]], [[shit nobody cares about|most notably]] [[gay|Juste]]. In the [[rape|fighting]] game ''[[crap|Castlevania: Judgment]]'', where [[Death Note]] artist [[Epic Fail|Takeshi Obata]] did the character designs, he gave Sypha [[tits|a new rack job]], as well as a [[Premenstrual Tension|PMSing]] personality, thus giving birth to her new name; [[slut|Slutpha]] [[bitch|Bitchnades]]. She's also a [[WTF|witch who works for the Church]].



*'''[[Blonde|Maria Renard]]''': Richter's sister-in-law who attacks by throwing [[cock|birds]]. Originally shown as a [[loli|little girl]] kidnapped by a [[black|dark]] [[priest]], she next appears as a [[horny]] [[jailbait|teenager]], chasing after Alucard. 


[[File:Carmilla.jpg|thumb|right|You'd [[fap|hit]] that.]]
'''Dracula and his Bitches'''



*'''[[vampire|Dracula]]''': The constant villain of the series. In every game, he gets brought back from the dead, and a Belmont has to kill him again. His usual tactics include breaking a [[Over 9000|number]] of wine glasses and transforming into his [[Karl Rove|true form]], which is never the same thing in any game, possibly the only variety in the series. <s>[[Some Argue|Supposedly]] destroyed once and for all by [[Wise Beard Man|Julius Belmont]] in 1999.</s> HE'S BACK!!!



*'''[[Internet tough guy|Death]]''': Before death, a nigga. no, really. thats all you need to know.




*'''[[whore|Carmilla]]''': Carmilla fucking loves Dracula. No. [[Srsly]]. She has [[butthurt]] over the fact Dracula is gay with Death and prefers his [[pun|boner]] over her [[fail|tits]]. She likes to wear typical whore outfits like fishnets and platform high-heels. [[emo|Alucard]] acts like he hates her and [[domestic violence|wants to kill her.]] [[rape|But we all know what he really wants from her.]]

== The Fandom ==
There's little information available about the ''Castlevania'' [[fandom]] currently, as it rarely escapes it's parent's basement. 

There is multiple fandom for ''Castlevania'' such as the knockoff JKA Mod being developed by omegasigma from FileFucks. There are now multiple ways to troll the fandom.

* Go on a ''Castlevania'' board and say that ''[[Lie|Castlevania: Legends]]'' is [[canon]], and that Igarashi [[fail|removed]] it from the time-line because he's [[retarded|sexist]].

* Start a [[forum]] topic stating that the [[retro|classic]] games are [[fact|better than the Metroidvanias]].

* In a poll about who's the best character, point out that [[faggot|Alucard]] is a shitty hero and [[Simon Belmont]] is moar manly.

* Tell them that the [[PS3]]/[[Xbox360]] game with Alucard is canceled, because [[unoriginal|Koji Igarashi]] was fired from [[Konami]], due to the [[shitty]] and repetitive games he has produced for the last [[at least 100 years|10 years]].

* Say that [[Metal Gear Solid|Hideo Kojima]] and [[Spain|Mercury Steam]] now own the ''Castlevania'' series.
