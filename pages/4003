'''''Incarnate''''' is a comic book [[traced|conceptualized, written, and drawn]] by Jew, son of [[KISS|that guy with the tongue]]. 

It recently rose to Internets fame when it became apparent that the characters and storyline were ripped off from various other manga, many of the panels were straight-up traced from said manga, and half of the art was not even <s>drawn</s> traced by Simmons in the first place.

Other than that, the "original comic" is about Revenants, who can regenerate. That's it.

==First Denial of Publication==
''Incarnate'' was originally up for publication not so long ago, under the name of [[skullfuck|Skullduggery]]. It was supposed to be published by IDW, a publishing company in alliance with [[Satan|Gene Simmons']] own comic company, but even then the art was so bad that the deal fell through. Nick was [[butthurt]] over the fact that not even his daddy's company would publish his kiddy book.

{{quote|Well, first off, the art simply wasn't good enough. The people at IDW must have had the patience of saints to deal with the chicken scratch I turned in to them. My art was messy and juvenile. Amateur at best. I'm nowhere near pro now, to be sure, but I'm miles beyond what i used to be, especially in character design and overall neatness. And, with the help of Nam Kim and his team, the book has really turned into something I can be proud of.|Nick Simmons|when displaying good sense.}}

However, Nick, instead of improving his art like everyone else does, decided it was best to trace. Because everyone knows you can do it on a professional level.

==Plagiarism Exposed==
[[Image:Bleach_incarnate_comparison.gif|right|thumb|What do you mean, traced?]]
[[Image:IncarnateHellsing_comparison.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Totally completely different.]]

Early parallels were drawn between [[shit|''Incarnate'']] and ''[[Hellsing]]'', namely the character design - Mot, the main character of ''Incarnate'', is basically just a gayer version of Alucard, the main character of ''Hellsing''.

While the alarm bells were sounded, nobody [[Shit nobody cares about|gave a shit]], and the similarities were just that - similarities. That is, until the [[wapanese|''Bleach'' fandom]] decided to put ''Incarnate'' and ''Bleach'' panels side by side and - surprise, surprise - proved that there was much, much more to it.

It turned out that, not only were the characters of ''Incarnate'' incredibly similar in design and personality as the characters of ''Bleach'', but that many panels in ''Incarnate'' had actually been traced. It seems that [[faggot|Mr. Simmons]] has plagiarized character designs, fight scenes, plot segments, dialogue, poses, and expressions both from [[manga]] and from online artists.

With no time to waste, the entire [[wapanese|''Bleach'' fandom]] was put on red alert. This then spread across the Internet. Faster than you can say "[[Streisand Effect]]", poor old Nicky was facing down the barrel of millions (and millions) of angry wapanese [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|charging their Bankai]] looking for his head on a [[wat|Naginata]].

==Backlash==

[[File:KuboSimmonscomparison.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Oh, shit! He's tracing [[IRL]], too!]]

Despite the ''Bleach'' fandom taking their sweet time to find out about this outrage, they went [[batshit insane]] over it, and they expected Simmons to make an official statement on the subject. Unsurprisingly, Simmons has not said anything to counter these accusations. [[Some argue]] that he is too busy crying through mouthfuls of ramen and pocky. However, several [[wapanese|weeabos]] somehow got a hold of [[fat|Kubo Tite]], the author of ''Bleach'', who has since made a [[Twitter|tweet]] acknowledging the plagiarism:
 {{quote|<small><small>So, uh, from yesterday night until this morning, there've been an amazing number of messages from overseas fans along the lines of "There's a manga imitating BLEACH in America!" Well, I had a look at the site and I don't understand English that well, but I think what's written there is something like "It's a manga drawn by Gene Simmons' son, Nick Simmons."

'''To be honest, the fact that Gene Simmon's son is a manga-ka disturbs me more than whether he's really copying or not'''."</small></small>|[[Troll|Kubo Tite]] - on not giving a fuck.}} 

On February 25th, however, [[OMFG|the weeabos actually got something done]]. The publisher of ''[[Incarnate]]'', [[poser|Radical Comics]], announced on its official blog that it would be halting distribution and production of ''Incarnate'' "until the matter is resolved". It will be interesting to see how his daddy gets Nick Simmons [[incest|out of this one]].

===Facebook Troll===
[[fag|Nick]] himself appeared to have gone on [[Facebook]] to defend his shitty tracing job. He said that he had never ever heard of ''Bleach'', had never read manga in his life (despite listing his favorite mangas and mangakas in various interviews as well as on his dA account) and [[BAWWWW|had no idea why everyone was being so meaaaan to him]]. Predictably, this was soon revealed to be a troll, but it was funny while it lasted.

===4chan Faggotry===
In honor of this mind-bending turn of events, [[moot]] decided to honor the shenanigans and renamed the /a/ board from '''Anime and Manga''' to '''Detergent and Magma''' (after fake Nick dissed ''Bleach'' as a "Detergent" comic and misspelled Manga to "Magma"). Because of the massive history of plagiarism in comics and cartoons, someone in /a/ suggested that /co/ also be renamed - to ''Plagiarism''.

==Nick's "Apology"==
On March 1st, Nick released (through a [[proxy|'representative']]) [http://comicsworthreading.com/2010/03/01/nick-simmons-releases-statement-takes-no-responsibility/ the following] statement:

{{Quote|Like most artists I am inspired by work I admire. There are certain [[lol|similarities]] between some of my work and the work of others. This was simply meant as [[an hero|an homage]] to artists I respect, and I definitely want to apologize to any Manga fans or [[USI|fellow Manga artists]] who feel I went too far. My inspirations reflect the fact that [[bullshit|certain fundamental imagery is common to all Manga]]. This is the nature of the medium.


I am a big fan of Bleach, as well as other Manga titles. And I am certainly sorry if anyone was [[offended]] or upset by what [[no u|they perceive]] to be the similarity between my work and the work of artists that I admire and who inspire me.|Nick Simmons |on not understanding the meaning of the word 'homage'.}}


Unfortunately, as this is clearly [[bullshit]], it has achieved nothing beyond making everyone angrier.
