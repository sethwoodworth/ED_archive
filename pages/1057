== What? ==
A Blue Box was a small, tone generating keypad, that allowed you to place long distance calls without paying. In the 1970's and 1980's when coins were deposited into a payphone certain tones were played, a tone for a quarter a tone for a dime, you get the idea.  When those tones played in whatever it cost to place the call, you were granted free phone calls.  This exploit has been found and since been rendered obsolete unless you can find old ass payphones somewhere....  Thusly, heroes could harass the world and invoke epic [[lulz]].

The Blue Box is not really blue; its superior wozzyness compels others to think that they see blue.

the blue box is the calling card of woz. anyone else claiming to have a working box is full of shit, and therefor full of woz. except for [[Captain Crunch]]: he's just full of crunch-berries

== History ==  
Long before the invention of the [[internets]], the typical college student had little to do except [[hippy|waste everyone's time]].  But because Woz was a [[nerd]], he liked to waste his time in other ways - like building computers.  After reading an article about the little tone machines, [[Woz|Steve Wozniak]] started building Blue Boxes.  They were originally created by a "Captain Crunch" but he bestowed his knowledge unto Woz [[for great justice]]. Woz was informed of its risks but under the influence of [[Steve Jobs|Steve Jobs's reality distortion field]], he was ordered to sell them for profit(!!!).  This didn't cause too many problems, except a few got in the hands of [[13 year old boys]].  They, being the annoying attention whores they are, gloated a tad too much of their 1337 haxxorz skillz and got the IRL banhammer.  Luckily, Woz and Captain Crunch avoided these idiots, laid low, and were never apprehended for their good work.
