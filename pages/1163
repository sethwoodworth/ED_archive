'''Pro wrestler Brian "Crush" Adams''' died in [[Florida]] of natural causes at the age of 44.  Two months after his buddy [[Chris Benoit]] became [[an hero]], "Crush" finally [[cum|succumbed to]] a broken heart. 

His [[incest|wife]] found him in bed, tied up [[Auto erotic asphyxiation|in some strange contraption]] that seemed to partially strangle him while he masturbated.  However, authorities confirmed that this had '''nothing''' to do with the WWE star's death, and that he was just a very emotional guy who really had no particular reason to go on living.
