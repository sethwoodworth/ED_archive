The '''[http://www.drudge.com/ Drudge Retort]''' (motto: ''[[goatse|Red Meat]] for [[furfag|Yellow Dogs]]'') is an e-colosseum where bitter IRL oldfags, alcoholics, sociopaths, the chronically unemployed, Christfags, rednecks, charlatans, racists, junkies, retards, and [[you|various combinations of the above]] gather to [[Ad hominem|brutally savage]] one another on a daily basis (and, occasionally, to [[Internet_Politics|discuss politics]]).

Shortly after entering his third consecutive sunlight-free decade of life, a [[n00b|17th-level paladin]] known IRL as Rogers Cadenhead took [[Computer Science III]], thereby gaining enough XP to become a [[leet|1337 h4xx0r]]. Thus, young Rogers discovered a way to [[jewgolds|make a living]] and remain a basement dweller at the same time.<br>

Cadenhead used to run the [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.cruel.com Cruel Site of the Day], and also [[win|exposed the fact]] that [http://workbench.cadenhead.org/news/2828/wikipedia-founder-looks-out-number-1 TOW founder Jimbo Wales had been editing his own biography]. Then, sometime [[last Thursday]], Cadenhead registered the domain '''drudge.com''' before that greasy dickbag [[drudge|Matt Drudge]] could get his [[smegma]]-encrusted hands on it. As a result, most users who end up habitually shitposting at the Retort [[win|found it entirely by accident]].<br>

As parody is the Retort's [[abortion|birthright]], it is only fitting that many [[retard|Drudgetards]] themselves are [[lulz|absurd mockeries of the human form]].<br>

News of this article was [http://www.drudge.com/news/121650/does-drudge-retort-mean-you brought to the DR's attention] by [[User:Jotun|an intrepid EDiot posting as '''LarryMOAR]]/Zarathustra''', who risked e-life and limb to spread the lulz. The chosen handle differs by only a single letter from the name of a [http://www.drudge.com/user/Larrymohr legitimate poster] and emulated his writing style, further adding to Drudgetards' confusion. In the end, LarryMOAR paid the ultimate price for injecting a bit of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|EDiocy]] into an otherwise ordinary late PM/early AM on the Retort. Fortunately, his other dissociated identity - Zarathustra - lives on to troll another day.<br>
All motions for restraining orders, [[LOL]]suits, claims of libel, as well as requests for endorsement deals and interviews, have been forwarded to LarryMOAR/Zarathustra's [[e-lawyer]], who stated that he was only authorized to release the following statement:<br>
{{frame|My client, LarryMOAR/Zarathustra, is in fine spirits this morning, and is expected to make a near-full recovery after being hit with the [[banhammer]] early this AM. He would like you all to know that he [[IDIFTL|did it for teh lulz]] and that he's been [[cannabis|properly medicated]] so as to prevent complications during his [[trepanation|upcoming surgery]] -- which was deemed necessary for the greater good of the gene pool. Mr. MOAR notes that hospital food isn't nearly as good as microwaveable Hot Pockets, Kraft EZ-Mac, or Mom's Spaghetti, however, and eagerly awaits returning to the simpler pleasures in life -- such as the unforgiving pwnage of n00bs in the [[World of Warcraft]], and masturbating before he masturbates to get the day started by 3 in the afternoon.|color=#CCCCCC;}}<br>

Apparently this prank was so successful - with Drudgetards effectively misdirected and spun in so many circles - that a [http://www.drudge.com/news/122154/retort-wednesday-nooner#2649988 full confession] would not suffice to quell skepticism among DR regulars:<br>
{{quote|Zarathustra, Bull shit. You didn't post it. Opportunist.|Posted by Ron_Karate.}}<br>
Disappearing into the crowd like an awkward pimple-faced teenager at a highschool dance, Zarathustra can now only spectate as blame will likely continue to be assigned to more favored scapegoats:
*''I am betting it's either Rex or Jackass. It's typical of their ilk.''
*''My guess would be that Montecore is the author of the page.''
*''Montecore's not that clever. I'm pretty sure it is ozarkaggie''
*''The culprit in my opinion? I believe Hans has come back and paid us a visit.''
*''I was thinking Nulli. He's been way too quiet lately.''
*''Does anyone remember the Secret Diary of Rogers Cadenhead?''
*''Creative enough to be Doc, but I don't know if he's geek enough. I'm going to guess that it was done by Roger's wife, who probably sees us as the bunch of freaks we are.''
*''it has manypaths written all over it - syntax. has he even weighed in on this yet?''
*''101 - was this your work? Tell the truth, man!''
*''AU, that you?''
*''I'm also beginning to think "Olly" is AU.''
*''Soooo? Olly (aka AU?) could have done the "What Does the DR Do for You?" thread along with help from Hans. AU did the background music for Han's "Drudge Retort Report" radio show so wouldn't be the first time AU and HANS worked together.''<br>
Recognizing that he'd been [[trying too hard]] for an unappreciative world, Zarathustra swore an oath to never leave Mom's basement again. Furthermore, in anticipation of the [[armageddon]], this hopeless fail-troll resigned himself to living out the rest of his days by surviving on microwaveable pizza rolls, chocolate milk, and masturbating '''at least''' six times a day to [http://thetrawbros.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/jessica-alba-bikini-07.jpg pictures of Jessica Alba].

Radio: Cadenhead Does Drudge Retort Report
http://www.drudge.com/archive/118276/radio-cadenhead-does-drudge-retort-report

We begin just as the rage is building to fever pitch. Goatman and Briwo have made some kind of "bet" - which really means it's shit nobody cares about - and now Goatee is eager to meet IRL.

~~~~~~

San Antonio (lots of vets and active duty there, so they will be easy to find) two weeks from today. $500.
I'll let you know the specific bar in the next few days.
I'll have to do some googling, but I'm not going to waste my time if you are simply going to back down.
Will you be there?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:05 PM


Will you, or will you not be in San Antonio two weeks from today to fulfill your end of your bet?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:09 PM


I'll be there two weeks from tomorrow. What bar will we be at, and can you suggest a hotel for me to stay at?
I'll make the reservations today and post my orbitz.com itenerary to prove it.
What airport do I fly into and what hotel is closest to the bar we'll be at -- sweetie. LOL
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:13 PM


Oh, BTW, are you cool with the $500 being the wager?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:13 PM 


You could've avoided the 'bluster' if you answered my questions about the particulars the first time.
Anyway, tell me what airport I'll be flying into in two weeks and the closest hotel to the bar where this bet is going to take place.
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:15 PM 


Sorry to be 'blustery' but getting information from you is like pulling teeth.
Airport and hotel, please.
If I don't show up in two weeks, THEN trash me.
But I can't be there if you don't tell me the airport I fly into.
Don't worry about the hotel -- I'll do that myself.
You seem to find these simple requests quite difficult.
So what airport will I be flying into?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:19 PM 


I'd love to meet more DRers in person.
Most of them are very nice people.
Anyway, briwo -- *sigh* -- once again:
What airport do I fly into in two weeks? fuck.
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:24 PM 


What airport do I Fly into in two weeks so that we can settle our bet?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:27 PM 


I guess I was never stationed on a ship that had a port of call [at Ft. Lewis].
I googled since it was such a fucking hard question for you to answer.
Do I fly into SeaTac? Is that right?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:29 PM 


Is SeaTac the airport I will be flying into?

Is SeaTac the airport I will be flying into?
Briwo, you are making it clear you have no intention on honoring your bet.
If you don't want to, just say so.
If you are going to be a man and honor it, help me get my travel together.
Is SeaTac the airport I will be flying into?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:36 PM 


if I knew you were one who makes a bet then renegs, it would've been over a long timem ago, too.
Is SeaTac the airport i will fly into?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:37 PM 


I hesitate even going here since it took so longfor you to type those six letters, SEATAC. But I have to know since Seattle is a big place and I simply don't want to go to every one of them looking for you: what is the name of the bar we will be at?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:39 PM 


*sigh* here we go again. Which bar?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:43 PM 


The bulk of my ff miles are with Continental, and I don't think they fly into there.
but I'll rent a car and drive if that is where the closest bar is.
BTW, what is the name of that bar?
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:45 PM 


...considering it took dozens of posts to get to this point and for you to type the six letters SEATAC, clearly you have such a problem.
Posted by goatman at 2009-02-27 05:48 PM 


BTW, I look forward to the trip.
I like Seattle (actually I like the entire US, so don't get too big headed) and the rest of the state.
I have a friend who lives in Priest lake Idaho and a cousin in Vancouver WA.
I'll probably make a couple of side trips while I'm up there to see them, too.

~~~~~~

the despondent liberal's weapon-of-choice would have been a purse - just as Joe suggested.
#91 | Posted by JeffJ at 2009-06-01 04:19 PM


You are full of shit. What if you couldn't get to your purse? What if you were overcome and someone took your purse and choked you with the straps? What if they got the jump on you and emptied the contents and shoved your own lipstick up your nose -- rose petal pink in one nostril and coral red in the other? What if the bad guy grapped your cuticle scissors and hacked a hole in your neck? What if when you swung the purse, your compact came out and the sun reflected off of the mirror in it and it blinded you? What if the car keys came in contact with an electrical outlet right next to you and you were electrocuted.
See, I just proved a purse is not a good weapon. No purse, no crime.

Actually it's the most dangerous thing to attack anyone with. Or is the left immune to a fact attack when caught bending the truth?

How do I get away with the shit I post around here? Don't blame it on RCade, blame it one the fact that Goatman is terrified of me. He is literally afraid to flag my posts.

#176 | Posted by goatman at 2009-06-01 05:37 PM


The Old Southern White Gentleman posts to other people about putting cocks down their throats and stuff like that and it deosn't even get deleted, much less dumped. I think RCade counts on the unbelievable amount of posts the poor guy makes every day for his ad revenue. I mean, he and BoOB can make 1,00's of posts in a single day on one single thread. I think Goat is the goat who lays the golden egg for RCade.

The [[Faggotry|Artist Formerly Known As Jak_Se_Mao]] is an alcoholic pony-raper who lives on, and "[[Buttsecks|maintains]]", [[Brokeback_Mountain|Brokeback Ranch]] in Pony's Asshole Burns Like Fire, [[Texas|TX]]. Somehow, Jak manages to stay conscious for a few hours each night - after a full day of [[Anal|digging post holes]] and [[Beastiality|shodding ponies]] no less - long enough to diarrheapost all over the DR. When he's not taint-deep in one of his unfortunate animals (or passed out in a 10-gallon cowboy hat full of his own vomit) Brokebak Jak can be found piss-drunkenly raging against [[Ghey|anything that threatens]] his precious [[USA|"Anglosphere"]].
{{quote|How does Jak manage to work 12 hour days digging post holes and stringing fence wire when he's on here at 2 or 3 am every night drunk on his ass? Lucky Strikes and beer combos are doing a great job hardening his arteries. No doubt the only thing getting hard around his house except his wife's heart.|AmericanUnity}}<br>
But, since [[Black_Jesus|President Obama]] was elected, a stormy, black mood has been following Jak everywhere he goes. Being one of them good ole' Texas boys, the presence of a 'coon in the Oval Office has ruined the rompin' hootenanny them ''white boys'' had been enjoyin' in them dayumned ''White House''. The undeniability of Obama's [[RAPE|sudden unwanted invasion of Fox News]] hangs like an albatross from Jak's neck to the point that he can no longer enjoy shodding the ponies, as they've long ago been stretched and blown out by his furied pony-poking. These days, not even an ice-cold Coors Lite and Lucky Strike combo (for those rough, scratchy days on the job, Jak needs that beer that won't fill him up and ''never'' slow him down) can quell Jak's [[rage]], so he seeks an online refuge from the realization that his worldview is quickly dying.<br>
In an interesting case study of both Freudian projection ''and'' reaction-formation, Jak's booze-soaked brain jerks to life, imagination suddenly sputtering online, whenever teh gheys come up in conversation or [[#Tosser|Tosser]] is detected posting. Perhaps wishing to escape the ennui of daily life as a pony-poker in Texas, Jak fantasizes of a little foreign four-legged pussy to add to his little black book. Then, frustrated by Tosser's affronts to his delicate sensibilities, an alcohol vapor hovers around Jak's head as he pecks at the keyboard just long enough to project his beastial fantasies to the entire [[internets]] before passing out (hopefully face-down) in a pool of his own beer vomit.

They have discount programs. If it's not a matter of money then make a new appointment with your shrink Rex. Seek help, seriously. Sitting on your ass, spending hours a day watching metal bands on YouTube until you've worked yourself up to a rage, is no way to go through life.|Whatsleft

|If this "REX ZEITGEIST" is [[virgin|unloved]] or [[masturbation|bored]] or lonely or whatever is his problem]], this thread is a total waste and at times I for one despair of this site.

[[old|Old Man Ray]] has seen a ''lot'' in his [[at least 100 years|lifetime]], and he wants you to know that he's finally figured out [[the game]].

A previous incarnation of Ray lived in 17th-century Holland and [[the game|lost the game]], along with all of his worldly possessions, when [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania Tulip Mania] went bust. Legend has it that Ray went so far as to barter away his ''last [[jewgold]]'' to speculate on a single tulip bulb, only to be ruined when a sailor mistook it for an onion. To his great dismay, Ray discovered the sailor "[[ruin|eating a breakfast whose cost might have regaled a whole ship's crew for a twelvemonth]]". The events of [[goatse|that horrific afternoon]] seared an indelible mark on Ray's eternal spirit and his anguish reverberated across centuries. Ray decided to never again part with a single jewgold, and vowed to accumulate as many as possible in his future lives.<br>

Over time, Ray has witnessed many an empire rise up only to be bitchslapped back down to earth by [[fail|hubris]], and notices many of the familiar symptoms occurring here in the USA. Rather than succumb to the [[Shit nobody cares about|forces of history]], Ray has taken preemptive action, singlehandedly constructing a fortress made of solid jewgolds -- complete with gilded meats, vegetables, and various potables. He sees the rest of the world as playing court jester to what will be his [[college|epistemologically-ordained]] royalty, but might still like to watch you chase and scrounge after a few jewgolds between noshes on the turkey leg you will be bringing him. In case [[you|the mob]] becomes too unruly or the best-case scenario otherwise doesn't pan out, Ray has personally overseen the construction of his very own [[headshot|Golden Gun]], and feels quite confident betting it against whichever antenna [[#Buffalo_Bob|da' bOoB]] chooses.<br><br>
