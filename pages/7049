'''ROFL''' ''(archaic: '''ROTFL''', pronounced '''"Roffle"''')'' is primarily used by smug [[16 year old girls]] laughing at each others' [[shit nobody cares about|hilarious antics]]. 
It meant '''"rolling on the floor laughing,"''' and was first used as far back as Shakespeare. In 'Macbeth' he wrote:

{{quote|Glamis thou art, and Cordor, and shalt '''ROTFL thy cvnt off''', when we kill that fvcking King|Shakespeare knew how work the blue}}

Two days after Shakespeare wrote this, it became irritating. By the advent of Broadband it was as pass√© as corduroy and today it is considered firmly [[old meme]]. DO NOT USE THIS EXPRESSION. If you do the reader may mistake you for an asshole and injure themselves ROTFL at your expense. To do so is to indicate that you are as slow as your dial-up connection and TWICE AS FUCKING ANNOYING.

To update the expression and safeguard it against the [[bullshit|HORROR]] of the [[windows|millennium]] [[XP|bug]] it was streamlined by removing a superfluous 'T'. This was found to increase its productivity by up to 25%, preserving the internet users' time for [[pr0n|more important pursuits]]. Win!
