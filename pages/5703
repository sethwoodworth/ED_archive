'''Nerdcore''' refers to the Nerdcore [[music]] genre or Nerdcore internet scene.  Nerdcore's a sub-genre of [[hip hop]] spawned in large part due to legions of [[manboy]]s' eternal love of [[internets]], [[science]], [[Atari|ancient consoles]], shitty [[DOS]] [[games]], and [[nostalgia]] for childhoods filled with [[plastic crap]].

As opposed to [[hip hop]], [[O RLY?|it should be noted that Nerdcore is produced and consumed by a 99.9% white demographic]].  

[[Not to be confused with]] [[wiggers]], the nerdcore [[fanboi]]/[[fangirl]] tends to be the more [[self aware]] than your average [[ebonics|ebonic]] spouting, [[suburban]] [[white|white-bread]] faggot.  Nerdcore fans both shamelessly bathe in their own hopeless, pale-faced [[geek]]dom, whilst at the same time maintaining a healthy loathe for most [[almost rapped|other wigger faggotry]].  The fanbase is largely [[internet]]-based to begin with, the lion's share of productions being released [[OTI]] independently, as the online "community" is known for being [[no homo|tight-nit]] with its fair share of [[elitist]] faggots.   Most nerdcore fans and [[artist]]s tend to distance themselves from anything "mainstream" altogether (as all [[subcultures]] do), [[facepalm]]ing at most of the [[techno|house]]/[[raver|trance]]/[[Kanye|Top 40]] faggotry that flood our tubes these days, thus most nerdcore fags are [[SFB|fervently dedicated]] to the genre, exclusively.  

==Style==

To save you from a shitload of ambiguous [[tl;dr]] you'll find everywhere else, it is simply defined by topic and lyric, not necessarily style - [[science fiction]] and [[geek]]-culture as its primary inspiration; [[hip hop]] as basis for form.  [[Sampling]] of ancient [[DOS]] and [[Nintendo|8bit]] [[video games]] is the norm, sometimes giving the music a flavor similar to [[chiptunes]], but it is never usually ''that'' electronically based, sounds ranging greatly.  

Common topics include [[internets]], ones [[1337]] [[basement dweller|prowess wit cumputoors]], [[WoW]], [[Star Trek]], [[Star Wars]], and, due to [[obsessive]] lust for [[retro]], any number of [[old school]] text-based [[PC]] or [[IRL]] [[Role playing|role playing]] games, [[D&D]], [[Magic: The Gathering|MTG]]...you get the gist.  

Although it has spawned largely due to [[lonely]] childhoods filled with [[Amiga|bleeps and blips]], [[some say|it's been said]] the genre itself also originated partially as reaction towards the drastic [[failure|downturn]] and fashion-show-like [[faggotry]] of the [[hip hop]] genre and [[niggery|related culture]] in the late [[90s|90's]] (basically after [[P Diddy]] left an enormous [[shitstain]] on it).  Thus, nerdcore flourished with the [[no life|internet-saavy]] and [[whitey|largely white]] fanbase who'd became fed up with [[bling]]-hop and the epic industry [[circlejerk]]ing...
