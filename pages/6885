Reason
If you, [[your mom]] or your [[wigger|dawgs]] want to make some ''fly beats'', some ''heavy beats'', even a couple of ''<s>fat</s> phat beats'', then '''Reason''' <s>is the ridiculously overpriced program you seek.</s> Just torrent it [[Faggot|fgts]].

Reason was created, like most [[Habbo Hotel|good things]], by ghey Finns under the banner of Propellerhead Software.  They utilized [[Emo|cutting]] edge MIDI technology, combined with high frequency fart audio sampling techniques to create a program capable of producing myriads of styles of [[music]], anything from [[techno|jungle]] to [[techno|breakbeat]], [[techno|ambient]] to [[techno|synthpop]].

It is an amazing tool and has become as much an industry standard as ProTools.  Unfortunately, [[No more than 99|99.999%]] of Reason users prefer to make "music" that sounds like [[retard]]ed children smacking their heads against an electronic drum kit while [[old meme|''Scarface'']] plays in the background.

==Reason Musicians==
They are never actually musicians, because real musicians know better than to solely use Reason (or any other program by itself).  Instead, these are primarily [[scene]]sters who asked their [[geek]] friends to have them [[Warez|pirate]] a copy of it, due to some flash of [[aspie]]-like inspiration.  

Thankfully, these "musicians" soon realize it takes more than listening to [[goth|The Cure]] for 80 hours straight to be an artist, and eventually give up on the program.

Before they do that though, they figure out how to post their shit music onto some dark, dank music forum that allows that kind of thing.
