In the early morning hours of July 5, 2009, after a night of fireworks and constant drinking, [[Moot]] decided to go on [[Bittorrent]] and download one of Stanley Kubrick's films. He picked ''A Clockwork Orange''. The main character of this film, [[LINK MAH BOIIIII|Alex m'boy]], is a total [[troll]]. After watching the film, Moot felt dismal comparing his life of trolling with that of Alex. Moot knew that he could not emulate Alex because Alex was serious about breaking the law. Moot also saw the recent problems plaguing /b/ with no [[meme]]s having [[epic win]] created in the last month. He had to take charge of the situation.

==The Situation==
After forced and failed memes such as [[EPIN]], the creation of the The Vidya at /[[v]]/, or the Lanced Jack and Tiaga situation on /a/, Moot was going to force down a meme that no one wanted and troll the heck out of /b/, as a protest against all of the newfaggotry and lack of OC and quality new memes.

==The Attack Begins==
In the early morning hours, Moot began flooding /b/ with scenes of ''A Clockwork Orange'' in the pop-art "style" of [[fag|superfag]] Andy Warhol. The first attack went nuclear, flooding the site for hours straight with few breaks until finally letting up at 3 p.m. on July 5th. During this time, fellow [[Anonymous|Anons]] constructed bomb shelters to escape the nuclear radiation seeping from the threads of non-original content. Soon those threads also went 404 and left [[Anon]]s to deal with the harsh elements. Many, however, used [[/x/]] as a safe haven.

==The Second Attack==
In the afternoon hours of July 6th, the chemo treatment of /b/ continued with Moot flooding the board with threads of ''Clockwork Orange'' pics in different dominant colors. The attack let up again at around 7:00 p.m. Central Time. Most people just decided to leave /b/ and go to other boards, believing, as usual, that this was some kind of [[DDoS]] with /b/ as the only target. Little did anon know, sitting in his mom's basement jerking off with his [[Fleshlight]] that the following day, all hell would break loose.

==The Third Day==
On Tuesday, July 7th, 2009, Moot decided to truly destroy 4chan once an for all and have it rise like a great winged [[Furry]] from the ashes of non-OC. He proceeded to use his [[personal army]] of spambots that he likely recruited from [[Anontalk.com]] to spam every single fucking board on the site. Notably, /r9k/ the board for original content of all sorts was left unscathed. This was used as the fallout shelter for the wasteland that 4chan had become. For hours almost the entire site was bombarded with pictures from ''A Clockwork Orange'' in different hues.
