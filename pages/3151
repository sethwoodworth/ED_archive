Fursecution Fox
[[Image:Standing_Proud.jpg|thumb|center|600px|This is the original Standing Proud image drawn by Taurin Fox to protest [[fursecution]].  It has nothing to do with protesting the banning of gay marriage.]]

'''Fursecution Fox''' is that nasty looking, effeminate, man-boobed, crying fox you see in those [[rape|touching]] images posted by furries when they are bitching about [[fursecution]] and won't [[STFU]]. These are based on [[An hero|''Standing Proud,'']] the well known piece of [[furry art]] created by [[Taurin Fox]] in 2004. It is full of [[AIDS]] and [[BAWWWWW|furry bitching]].
