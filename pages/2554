EPIC

__NOTOC__[[Image:Soepic.jpg|thumb|VERY EPIC BUSINESS!]]

'''Epic''' is used to refer to something particularly incredible. For example, a standard, non-epic [[win]] would be posting a single [[lulz]]worthy thread on any forum, or creating a particularly [[oh exploitable|lulzworthy picture]]. Alternatively, a standard [[fail]] usually consists of a very basic failure, i.e. [[unfunny|trying to be funny and sucking]]. An [[epic fail]] usually results in (preferably) an [[suicide|IRL permaban]]. Or at least, that's what it used to mean.

Now it's a meaningless adjective which /b/ staples into every single thing, be it truly epic or not. "Epic" is /b/'s 3rd most overused word of all time.

Overuse of the term in an online context (sadly) originates from ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', where in the earliest version of that game, an "epic" item (weapon or piece of armor) was the highest level item that was commonly available. [[fail|Very win.]]

Sadly, the term is often abused by [[12 year old]] faggots who use it far too often; thus robbing it of its potency.

Like a lot of things, it may be difficult to grasp the scope of things that can or cannot be labeled epic without first exploring some examples. If you [[retard|still don't get it]], see below.

===[[Epic Win]] vs. [[Win|Normal Win]]===
[[Image:Epic_bj.jpg|thumb|<strike>Yes this is EPIC.</strike> Lulz eye fetish.]]

Win: [[headshot|Shoot an old man in the face]] and get away with it.<br>
Epic Win: [[Dick Cheney|Get him to apologize to you]].

Win: Become [[President]] of the [[America|United States]].<br>
Epic Win: When you [[W|get less votes than the other guy]].<br>(This is actually an epic fail on the part of the American people, but a good example of epic win for [[George Bush|Dubya]].)

Win: Create a Dos attack on a goofy fake religion.<br>
Epic Win: Start an international, Warren Ellis-approved, [[IRL]] movement to liberate millions of tards from a goofy fake religion. <br>

Win: [[Cunt|Vag]] tap a girl at a party for being a [[your mom|dumb bitch]].<br>
Epic Win: Have girl kiss and [[asking for it|apologize to you]] for having done it.<br>

Win: Give a [[feminazi]] what she [[rape|deserves]].<br>
Epic Win: Make her admit it was her fault.

Win: Getting away with playing games at [[school]], when the teacher is looking.<br>
Epic Win: Having teacher joining in on [[the game]].<br>
Epic Fail: If the teacher wins.

== Mathematical Definition of Epic ==

It is trivial to spot Epic things in category theory. If q : B â†’ Q is a coequalizer of some pair of arrows, then q is Epic, where a coequalizer is just the dual of an equalizer. 

If we have a Category A with all the people who can die horribly and a category B in which the situation spirals out of control. And a category Q where the fucktard is found in a empty hotelroom with a dildo in his arse. And a category Z with all the outcomes that leads to its final demise. We can draw the following diagram:
<pre>
  f,g   q
A -> B -> Q
     |z   |u
     \--> Z
</pre>
Then the action (arrow) q is truly Epic, if and only if there exists a unique arrow u, such that uq = z. In normal terms, if there is no action u, which leads the subject from the dildo part to its own demise, it is not Epic.
