'''[http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=8107097531 Bebo Concerned]''' is a [[Bebo]] group that is moderated by a gang of undersexed middle-aged mothers, who feel as if it is their God-given duty in life to single-handily police the entire Internet. The group came to the forefront of Anonymous' attention when it and a sister group called Fake Finders organised a mass report against one of Anonymous' main Bebo haunts, inevitably leading to its deletion by the KGBebo Administrators. This led to what one with a deep understanding of the Internet and its surrounding tubes would call a [[shitstorm]], as an army of restless trolls with nothing better to do with their time decided to seek revenge on those who had so mercilessly depraved them of their [[OL]] home. 

== War ==
War broke out and not long after, [[anonymous]] had gleaned enough information about these privacy-savvy moderators to start taking back the [[Internet]] and the freedoms that it had promised them. It was found that one moderator was a 40-something year old blind [[vegan]] whose main hobby in life seems to be having epileptic fits. Upon discovery of Jennie Ellouise's (real name: Amanda Belcher) personal information, Anonymous quickly published everything to the public domain, along with several [[Photoshop]] edits of her [[Facebook]] profile image. This single action alone, against a blind vegan woman who suffers from epileptic fits, proves that [[Anonymous]] is physically and emotionally incapable of showing any mercy whatsoever.
== Anne (Bebo Mama) ==
Anne Swillen, the head modfag behind Bebo Concerned, operates under the screen-name '''Bebo Mama''', which pretty much sums up her entire do-as-I-say-or-else [[OL]] attitude. Her information, and information/images relating to her darling young daughter Katrina, were also found and distributed to the general Bebo populace.


== Iain Rooney ==
Iain Rooney is a Loyalist [[Scotsman]] who is steadily balding at the age of 21. Fat and unwanted by [[cumdumpsters]], Iain spends his time on the Internet, herocially battling away against evil demonic trolls. Please take some time to read a story that Iain wrote when he was 20.

'''it was on a october night in callander and me and my friends were walking by the calalnder graveyeard when we got a glimps of a figer staring at us it was glowing in the dark. as we looked at it to me and my friends it lookd like a green lady. so we all when to the libery the next day to look up on this lady and it come back as a lady who was murderd or drowned in the river teath at callander. meny years ago. she was murderd by her son who was so drunk he didnt know what he was doing to her. to this day it is still thair . we were very scared and couldnt move for shock. so. we all went in to the graveyard to look rownd the grave stones and it was a name that came to me amedeletly. it was maggy morison of callalnder. we took the cam corder in with us and filmd it to 10.00 pm and got something on cam. it was that lady. and thats the end of my story.'''
