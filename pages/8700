When it comes to [[YouTube]], pomposity is no rare commodity among [[vlog]]gers. <b>UpDownMostly</b>(AKA Tim), however, takes the frickin' cake. UDM loves to get on "the Tubes" and drone on and on about this and that involving online youth. Tim believes he's an authority on every subject, and loves to make videos telling you just that. Though many of his [[fanboy]]s are quite impressed with his vast worldly knowledge, most of YouTube can only attest that he has clearly [[fat|mastered the refrigerator]].

==Tim Who?==
[[Image:Dustinpicta.jpg|thumb|180px|Tim's competition: [[Ytask|Dustin Gardner]]]]
UDM was relatively unknown and mired in obscurity until the epic battle that transpired between the [[pedophile|kid-collecting]] titans [[Young Tubers United]] and [[Ytask]]. Tim sided with Young Tubers United, and engaged in an active campaign of discrediting Ytask, even though both group's activities were highly suspicious. When DJ of Ytask managed to get Young Tubers United and Jesari banned, Tim (and [[Irish282]]) went absolutely [[apeshit]]. Tim even went so far as to travel to the "One Tube" gathering in New York, on 7-7-07 to protest, and try and get Jesari reinstated. When that turned out to be total [[fail]], UDM returned to producing [[TL;DW]] vlogs on his usual boring subjects. (Tim is currently up to 362 videos, [[zomg]]!)

==Profiles in Hypocrisy==
[[Image:Tims_gay_m_and_m.JPG|thumb|UDM's channel icon, a big, gay, round fruitloop full of [[shit|brown stuff]]. Hmmm, sounds familiar.]]
[[Image:Tim_tin_foil.JPG|thumb|It can be kiddies tiem now?]]
[[Image:Upmostlybus.jpg|thumb|Scoping out boys on the bus and angry that this boy has a girlfriend.]]
It was soon after Tim returned from "One Tube" that people began asking questions. In UDM's own video "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Yxgv5yljU|Vid 4:Response to Baseballfeather9]", Tim stated in no uncertain terms that ANYONE that is involved with kids, even him, should be held accountable. And that when such people are asked questions, there should be answers, and good ones. UDM, however, changed his tune when people actually DID started asking those very same questions of him. Instead of answering the questions, Tim put his channel on lockdown (ala [[Irish282]]). No comments or video responses got in or out without his express consent. [[Anonymous]] wouldn't accept that, and continued the accusational assault [[sockpuppets|through other avenues]]. Tim made [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQyBhH95qzo this stupid video](removed), thinking that would help him. [[Moar]] [[fail]].

Project Lufthansa was launched. The plan was simple: release as many anti-UDM videos as possible at the same time. The signal to "go" would be timed with Tim's next uploaded video, and tagged with the same meta-tags as his video. This insured that they would show up in the sidebar next to his vid, something he had no control over. The mission was a huge success. Tim cracked. He broke down and released this lulzy response video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHUHxPR65cM Q and A For the Wolves].(video removed)

==The [[Final Solution]]==
Tim finally came to the realization that he was screwed. There was no way that he could continue his previous way of life and remain subscribed to so many underage [[13 year old boys|boys]] and [[16 year old girls|girls]]. The ghosts of the past just wouldn't let him get on with his life. He nuked his channel and [[Ban_fucking_everyone|banned fucking everyone]]!!!111 After which he posted this lulzy disclaimer: "I recently SCRUBBED my entire channel. Subscribe if you like."

==A New Lease On Life==
After [[Ban_fucking_everyone|banning fucking everyone]], Tim felt cleansed. It was as if he could now explore subjects that he was [[pedophilia|too afraid to touch before]]. Zipster made a video in which he pretty much pleaded for people to not call him a pedophile, despite his prior membership in the [[YouTube Vigilantes]]. Tim made a [[butthurt]], but lulzy,  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXa8a3vTork response video] where he said, "[[whambulance|at least you haven't had a video game made about you]]"(please see below for [[moar]] about his video game). Tim is now even posting up [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJTpq3Vh_U4 online safety videos!] Surely, [[Irish282|a pedophile wouldn't do that!]].

While Tim was busy pretending to fight pedophilia, [[YTYC|the real pedo-hunters]] were making short work of him and his cohorts. This disturbing video hit the scene, and established the link between him, [[Irish282]], [[Young Tubers United]], and [[sick fuck|boylovers]] like [http://www.youtube.com/user/tobiranhorde TobiranHorde]. 

When word gets to Nico(TobiranHorde) that UDM is dissing his Boychat shirt, Nico makes a video titled: "[[bullshit|I am NOT pedophile]]". Tim immediately issues this stern talking-to: "I'm going to be very wary of my interactions with you" Oh noes!!! Updownmostly confesses: "I'm an asshole." It's true.

==Tim makes up a whopper of a lie==

[[Image:Deepfryerburns.jpg|thumb|right|Actual deep fryer burns.]]

In his latest foul move Tim makes up a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXMgZiuwIDI whopper of a lie]. He told the [http://www.youtube.com/user/tjsmomma parents of TJ] his son fell with his arm up to his shoulder in a deep fryer. He was brought to the hospital and miraculously he was not only let go off after a week (this is impossible with burns this bad) he also has no visible "bad scars" according to [[Pedophile|Timothy Ladd (Updownmostly)]]. 

This incident proves Tim is related to [[God|Jesus Christ our lord]] himself. To clarify: Tea leaves horrible burns to a person if applied [[Fail|properly]], and is only 65 degrees maximum. A deep fryer is set on 265 degrees minimum up to a whopping 375 degrees maximum. If a person has his whole arm burned that bad he could die easily if unattended. It would have the person lay in the burns unit for a long, long time and leave horrible scars that would need plastic surgery for years to come.

It would require skin grafts and lots of treatment. [http://www.hse.gov.uk/slips/experience/flash-fries.htm Source of what these scars would look like irl], as well as proof that when you slip and fall you would not get your whole arm up to your elbow into the deep fryer. However, the fall angle is debatable, the story of only a week in a burns unit is impossible as well as the not leaving scars part is nothing short of a huge whopper of a lie.

Update: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SYzYKMGj2U Suddenly the deep fryer was already turned off, and Tim describes the picture posted here in his new video as his own.]

Another update: Tim silently removed both videos. I wonder [[Lie|why]].




==UpDownMostly talks about ED==
[[Image:Young_tubers_united_irish282.jpg|frame|right|[[lolwut]]...fake domain registration info?...i thought Irish was against making up fake accounts!?!?!]]

Epic phail. '''Here is [[ED]]'s rebuttal [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5HMfu3H8wg]'''. The Weather is NOT FINE

'''Embedding disabled by request. just click on image and be directly linked to [[drama]]'''
<br>
UpDownmolesty talks about all the [[drama]] and the [[YouTube]] '''COMMUNITY.''' (A word often used in epic phail on youtube). Yet he phails to answer the simple questions asked to him. Pretending to be the youtube Dali Lama and putting all the blame on youtube at the same time. His boytoy was underage, thus banned. Deal with it, fatty.

Also he talks about "reconnecting" with all the young supple lads in his subscriber-base.

==UpDownMostly's [[Fat]] [[Faggot]] Friend Phil To The Rescue==
In this [[tl;dw]] video Tim's friend, "EastSide Phil" the [[faggot]], gets on his moral high horse and breaks into a <s>[[Fat|diabetes]]</s> diatribe that puts even [[themaskedanalyst]] to shame. In this whirlwind of verbosity, the portly fairy breaks it down into very simple terms for the "younger viewers": long-winded cum-guzzling asspirates are morally superior to people that battle [[YouTube]] [[pedophile]]s. [[STFU|Whatever you say Phildo.]]  
<br>
<br>

{{quote|While I am a cum guzzler, I am not an asspirate. You guys might want to correct that.|'''FantasticBabblings''' - ''because ED is [[lies|"Full of Truth"]]''}}

==Tim's Less Than Triumphant Return==
After approximately three weeks, Tim decided that [[LiveVideo]] sucks ass, and returned to YouTube. Of course he was ashamed at what a punk ass bitch he was for reneging on his own rebellion against YouTube, and subsequently returned full of more whiny butthurt angst than ever. This necessitated that Tim open up a new "edgier" channel to release his butthurt on, called {{youtube2|UDMRAW|UDMRAW}}. Tim vowed to talk about "more controversial" topics (like his pedophilia) on his new channel, and promised to leave all detractors unblocked, in an effort to keep dissent off of his {{youtube2|UpDownMostly|UpDownMostly}} channel. 

==Breaking The Lawl==

[[Image:Updownart.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's rendition of fat bastard, UpDownMostly]]
Despite his new bold channel, and his new muppet-like clean-shaven appearance, Tim has decided to beat a hasty retreat into the nether regions of the Internet [[Lawlsuit]], ala [[DynaCatlovesme]] style. Unlike Dyna's version, prepared by an actual [[lawyer|shyster]], Tim's version has been put forth in [[lol|vlog format]]. This can be seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWRivYUtFuI here].
==Deja Vu==
[[Image:Crashdummy.JPG|thumb| Tim forgetting that [[nobody cares]].]]

Tim, still unhappy that YouTube refuses to give him a partnership, decided to runaway... again.[http://www.vloggerheads.com/profile/UpDownMostly This time however], Tim decided on the slowly dying silver bushed circle-jerk known as [[Vloggerheads]]. The difference between this and his adventure on the [[live video|promised land]] is that this time his cocksucking fanbase didn't make the transition. He also seems to have let loose with concealing his pedophilia, as he made around 5 video responses to a 4 year old, one that appeared on his lap in a handful of YouTube videos. He also decided that trying to be a conductive member of society was below him, within his second month on the site he asked such in depth questions as "do faggots have souls?" "are [[niggers|black people]] evil?" and of course the always asked but rarely answered "does [[Sarah Palin]] shave her vagina?" (the answer is no btw.)

Shortly after he began posting his videos to his [[loli|4 year old friend]], vloggerheads was compromised, and the videos were leaked. Soon after people began asking questions, unlike Tim's questions these were a bit more reasonable, questions like "why is a 54 year old making so many videos and sending presents to a 4 year old?", the answer to this question [[pedophile|should be obvious.]] Shortly thereafter Tim scrubbed the videos, but by that time it was too late, and Mikeskehan had already infiltrated the site. He began crying of course that such people should not be allowed on the site lest its homosexuality be challenged, and in the interests of "free speech" asked how far it could be taken before someone was banned. His first attempt to see how far it could be taken was his series on whether or not homosexuals have souls. His second was to post Sarah Palin nudes all over the site. Turns out the answer to Tim's question was "free speech goes as far as your mouth goes down [[Renetto]]'s cock-shaft". This event made him a social outcast on a site full of social outcasts. In order to get his views back up and get more attention he began talking on cam about how he was molested as a child, and how trolls operated on early MUD systems, when that all failed to distract people he came up with a false illness that he is currently [[lolcow|milking]]. Presently Tim can be found crying on cam (both literally and figuratively) in a desperate bid to get more views on his YouTube account, since his Vloggerheads account is dying a slow, painful death.

==Dr. UpDownMostly, I Presume==
[[Image:Orly niggers.png|thumb|[[cool story, bro]]]]
In addition to his other [[none|many talents]], Tim has now decided that he's also a highly qualified [[E-Psychiatrist|Internet Psychiatrist]].

==The fat man cometh (webstore)==

[[Nambla]] Timothy started Jew people now by reselling cheap crap for lot's of jewgold. Through a fellow [[NAMBLA]] member, he can host 10.000 domains for nothing as long as there's lots of [[shota|boysex]] involved.

*[http://updownmostly.com/store/ His NAMBLA boyloving megastore]
*[http://udmhost.com His shitty reseller hosting crap (check those prizes LULZ)]

Whether he was inspired by [[LoganSperman2]] to start a web panhandler "service" is unclear. It is clear however that he grosses in an extra income of 12 cts per month.

==More scamming by the fat man==

That's right! All you need to do for a lousy 100 $ gift certificate is do [[Fail|all the work]] for the fat man's mala fide [[Scam|web company]]! If [[NAMBLA]] Timothy was inspired by [http://www.youtube.com/wackadoodlefreezone tjsmomma] to start a little pan handling online is unclear. What the fatman is asking in said video, logo and calling card design, is upon the most costly expenses for any company.
