'''Sarah Palin''' (AKA: [[Barbie|''Caribou Barbie'']] and ''Sarah Failin'') is a criminally [[insane]] [[neocon]] blow-up doll. Intellectually unqualified to be a pre-school teacher, Sarah Porkloin ran for Vice President of the [[United States]] with [[Republican]] [[John McCain]]. Notoriously [[attention whore|photogenic]], she is also the former [[Alaska|Governor of the Kitchen]], a [[Quiverfull|mother of <s>five</s> four]], and a total [[GILF]]. Palin is also currently tied with [[Christine O'Donnell]] for the [[Shit nobody cares about|Guinness world record]] for [[Sarah Palin|Stupidest Person on Earth]]. In addition, she also holds the world record for loosest vagina, which she obtained after giving birth to a 15-pound tard baby whose head is roughly the size of [[Alaska]]. Despite her shortcomings, she often appears in the wet dreams of [[fat]], balding [[conservative]] [[males]] because of her large [[knockers]] and lack of speaking ability. She is also a self-described "Mama Grizzly," so take from that [[furry|what you will]].

A former [[stripper]], Sarah Palin was discovered by McCain in a sleazy Anchorage [[Lemonparty|gentleman's club]] while he was attending a [[lemonparty|champagne party]] in the VIP room. She's the hottest piece of ass ever involved in presidential politics, except for maybe [[Ron Paul]]. She's likely to become the [[Republican]] batshit [[Christfag]] candidate in 2012 or once the race riots after [[Obama]]'s assassination have died down. In short, she'll [[derp|herp your derp]], America.


==Republican's #1 Whore==
[[Image:Palin_original.jpg|thumb|She's not disrespecting the flag cos it's not touching the floor...yet.]]

{{quote|One sign at a rally [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080907/ap_on_el_pr/mccain_palin] said about Sarah Palin, "Real change with a real woman."  That is opposed to [[Ann Coulter]] who is [[shemale|not]] a real woman.}}

Republican men like her because she knows when to shut up and take it up the ass and giggles when [[McCain]] calls her a [[cunt]].

When asked about being Vice President:

{{quote|Palin told Kudlow that she could not answer the question of whether she wanted the job '''“until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the VP does every day'''|[Sarah Palin] [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25970882/ Beauty Queen]}}

It is a fair question, according to the Constitution, the Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided. Also they have the responsibility of [[Dick Cheney|shooting a lobbyist in the face]] and going to state funerals.

People say this woman looks like [[Saturday Night Live|Tina Fey]].

===Miss Congeniality===
[[Image:Better_than_tats.JPG|thumb|Sarah Palin - '''Better''' than [[lemonparty|tits]]!]]

[[Shit nobody cares about|Born February 11th 1964 in Sandpoint, Idaho]], this moose-burger eating, fly fishing [[Creationist]] got her [[Lesbian|Dyke]] on early by playing high school [[basketball|Basketball]] and was given the nickname [[Bitch|Sarah Barracuda]] by the other carpet munchers on her team. 

Not satisfied with going down on [[Lesbian|tall homely girls]], she applied to go down on [[Whores|beauty pageant contestants]] in the [[Feminism|Miss Alaska contest]]. Not having enough Vaseline for her teeth thighs and ass, she won second place, the equivalent of [[Fail|Miss Congeniality]]. According to her, she displayed her naked body for money "[[Hookers and Blow|for college]]" - excellent training for a career in politics. It is highly wondered if Palin's tits are saggy or still at milf stage.

<b>Here's VP [[MILF|MILF]] [[100_years_ago|in 1984]] she was just an [[slut|ILF]] (Please, don't [[FAP]] to this!): </b>
<youtube>KJfYgzfbNyk</youtube>

Rumor is her talent was [[List_of_sex_moves|Eskimo deep-throat]].

After many adventures doing [[pr0n]], Palin headed off to [[Idaho]] state and got her BA in [[Chris Hansen|Journalism]] officially making every shit ass local news anchorman and wanna be [[Actor|performance artist]] ready to be a [[Republican]] Vice Presidential Candidate.  True to her journalist heritage, Palin reads [[Over_9000|all]] the newspapers[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRkWebP2Q0Y].

Somewhere between [[Ass Rape|ass raping]] chicks and local sports and meteorologist anchors sporting a [[1980s|dynasty haircut]], she married a guy who believes that getting onto [[Fucktard|a snowmobile is an actual sport]] and popped out [[Birth control|four children]].

After [[Blow job|blowing]] her way into being on the city council and then the [[Shit nobody cares about|mayor of Wasilla]], she missionaried an [[Fail|unsuccessful run]] for lieutenant governor in 2002. When that didn't work out, she doggy styled her way as chairman of the [[Shit nobody cares about|Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission]] and finally gang banged her way into a term for governor of [[Alaska]].

==Why Palin?==

[[File:Palin invisible dicks.jpg|thumb|[[Invisible]]!]]
[[Image:Sarah-palin-BJ.gif|thumb|Palin's vetting process.]]
[[Image:Palin_M4.jpg|thumb|Actual [[k/|/k/ommando]]: [[Masturbation|FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP]]]]

It's fairly obvious that after going through [[Google|the vetting process]] for VP, Palin was the last Republican in America without any [[Pedobear|skeletons in her closet]]. Unfortunately, the GOP forgot to pat down Palin's [[Bristol Palin|family]]. After several 'scandals' recently came to light, one McCain strategist said they were "keeping their fingers crossed" in hopes that additional information does not force McCain to [[Disregard that|revisit the decision]]. According to this Republican, the McCain team used little more than a Google as part of a rushed effort to review Palin.

Apart from that, the [[Original research|only logical conclusion]] that can be drawn from Palin's selection is that she [[fucked]] her way to the top. The first time McCain and Palin met [[last Thursday]] they hit it off and had hot, passionate sex. Whilst [[Bukkake|blowing]] McCain she kept stopping right before he was about to [[cum|blow his load]] and asking if [[I Can Has Cheezburger?|I can has Vice presidency]], McCain finally gave in and shot his [[I Came|warm drippy cum]] all over her [[lemonparty|wrinkled fucking face]]. McCain only used his wife for money and the sex between him and that [[cunt]] had worn out. After John McCain gained a craving for the [[MILF]] Palin and later he called Palin back and asked her to become his running mate and fuckbudy. Palin was disappointed with the size of McCain's [[cock]] but accepted so she could become the vice president. Having dumped his first wife for another woman [[Pedobear|twenty years his junior]], McCain was also falling back on his reliable, tested strategy of using young, attractive women to fulfill his political ambitions.

===The Campaign gets Coyote Ugly===
Since picking the Eskimilf as his running mate, her airheadedness, her ties to extremists, the Bridge to Nowhere, her environmental policy, the corruption charges, her stance on abortion, her bookburning, her sucking of [[Bush]]'s cock, everything about her has caused most of America to [[shit brix]] en masse at the prospect of her anywhere near the White House. Polls indicate she is the single biggest drag on the McCain campaign, and McCain only now seems to realize how big he fucked up. 

In a recent interview with McCain and Palin (who makes a point of [[camwhore|flashing some leg]]), McCain gets visibly pissed as Palin begins emitting a high-pitched, inchoate whining from her upper fuck-hole (around 3:40). Regretting his pick much?

==Precious Snowflake==
[[Image:PalinBiden1.png|thumb]]
[[Image:Palinbiden.jpg|thumb|right|Biden knows his stuff.]]
Despite being a super t-u-f-f bitch in lipstick who is super rdy to take over once Saul kicks the bucket, Palin is not quite prepared to face the awesome Democratic lazor powers of hip hop sensation, Joeseph Biden.

Hip-Hop Battle, ILL SKILLZ

<center><youtube>MewhhStuLI4</youtube></center>


Spreading the news like [[cum|cream cheese]] and smoked salmon on a bagel, Jew York times kvetches the following report:

"At the insistence of the McCain campaign, the Oct. 2 debate between the Republican nominee for vice president, Gov. Sarah Palin, and her Democratic rival, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., will have shorter question-and-answer segments than those for the presidential nominees, the advisers said. There will also be much less opportunity for free-wheeling, direct exchanges between the running mates.

McCain advisers said they had been concerned that a loose format could leave Ms. Palin, a relatively inexperienced debater, at a disadvantage and largely on the defensive"

Although Palin is a political woar-eror when she has a months in advance, truthy, prepared for her teleprompt scroll that she delivers to a desperate echo chamber, expecting a woman to advocate for herself and her running mate's platform in front of millions of people without help from her handlers is [[Why do you hate America?|sexism]] beyond the pale.

[[Image:Red Sarah.jpg|thumb|Palin is enjoying retirement.]] 

*'''Abortion:''' Palin is the [[sarcasm|perfect candidate for women]] given her strict stand on [[abortion]] and [[rape]], having said [[sick fuck|she'd force raped girls to carry their rapist's baby to term]].  Abortion should be a private matter between a woman and her coathanger.

*'''Guns:''' Palin is a strong supporter of [[Columbine|the]] [[Virginia Tech massacre|right]] [[NIU shooting|to]] [[Delaware State University Shooting|bear]] [[guns|arms]].
*'''Homosexuality:''' Like any good republican foot soldier, Palin stands for [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6P2DQvd1d4 protecting] the [[Britney Spears|sanctity of traditional marriage]] against [[Marriage is love|homo unions]]. This means McCain has to pull out and cum on her face instead of blowing his load in her ass. Also encourages America to [[Trying too hard|pray away the gay]] ([[srsly]]).
*'''Infrastucture:''' Still receiving funds for the Bridge to Nowhere.
*'''Religion:''' Palin is a professed [[Christfag]] and proud [[Creationist]].  But don't worry, Christian girls can still take it [[in the ass]] and it [[Technical virgin|totally doesn't count]].

==Family Matters==
[[Image:PalinFamily.jpg|thumb|Happy family portrait.]]

Despite her emphasis on "[[God hates fags|family values]]," Palin's own family life is actually pretty [[Redneck|fucked up]] (seriously, what'd you expect when you name your kids with words like Trig, Track, [[Bristol Palin|Bristol]], Willow and Piper?). Let it suffice to say that Palin's [[16-year-old girl|17-year-old daughter]] Bristol won't be attending the [[Purity Ball]] this year.

I mean...one of them's named after a character on ''[[Buffy_the_vampire_slayer|Buffy]]'' I'd like to [[sex|bone]].

===[[Retarded]] (Grand?) Son===

[[Image:Can I has baby.jpg|thumb|Spot the pregnant person in this photograph.]]

Palin has been a firmly [[abortion|pro-life]] politician, including in cases of [[rape]], [[Arkansas|incest]], health of the mother, or [[retard|birth defect]].  Then, in a [[irony|cruel twist of fate]], her most recent child (#5) was born with [[down syndrome]], dooming him to look [[azn]], but with the intelligence of a black person. She even knew beforehand and [[pro_choice|decided]] [[Stupid|to keep it]], earning her the undying love of pro-lifers and Christians everywhere.

:'''Alaska governor accused of covering up teen daughter's pregnancy'''
<i>
:The Anchorage Daily News

:Thursday, March 6th, 2008; 12:02 AM

:JUNEAU -- Gov. Sarah Palin shocked and awed her Capitol colleagues Wednesday when she announced she is expecting her fifth child.

:The governor, who recently turned 44, told a handful of reporters as she was leaving work to expect a new member of the first family, then headed to a reception at the Baranof Hotel to feast on king crab. Palin said she is already about seven months along, with the baby due to arrive in mid-May.

:That the pregnancy is so advanced astonished all who heard the news. The governor, a runner who has always maintained a trim figure, has avoided overt signs of pregnancy.  Even close members of her staff said they only learned this week their boss was expecting.

:Palin's daughter Bristol is 16 years old and attends an Anchorage high school. School administrators report that she has been out of school for months, claiming a prolonged case of mono.
</i>
<br>
The single thing that makes it so that only a [[Daily Kos|fuckshit]] would believe this is the [[fact]] that Bristol would have been 5 months pregnant with another child when giving birth to the first. As most [[asspie]]s know this is physically [[Large_Hadron_Collider|impossible]] and would merely result in the older child [[gay|choking on his daddies cum]].

So Palin apparently either decided she wanted a [[Special_Education|downy]] and waited until she was 44 to have her last child, or had a very unlucky [[16-year-old girl|teenage daughter]] with two vaginas, one for each baby. 

The older the pregnant woman, the greater the risk of her baby being born with three of chromosome 21, instead of two. When babies have this extra chromosome, they are Downy. Here are the risks:

===What are the maternal age risks for Down syndrome?===

'''Maternal Age_____Risk at birth'''<br>
15 to 24 years___1 out of 1,300<br>
25 to 29 years___1 out of 1,100<br>
35 years_________1 out of 350<br>
40 years_________1 out of 100<br>
'''44 (and older)___1 out of 25!!!'''<br>

Given one out of 25 children born to a 44-year old woman will be a retard, for Palin to decide on having a baby at the age of 44 was just [[asking for it]].  Alternatively, [[incest]] also increases the chance of the defect, but only DNA testing could confirm whether Bristol's child is the result of [[Josef Fritzl|relations with her father]].

Or if they just admitted it.

===Bristol Palin===
[[Image:Palin-Bitches1.png|thumb|left]]
[[Image:Juneau.jpg|thumb]]
''Main arctic-le: [[Bristol Palin]]''

To combat the rumors of her faked pregnancy, Sarah Palin announced that her [[Bristol Palin|17-year old daughter, Bristol]] really is knocked up, thus proving that [[fact|all teenage daughters of Republicans are whores]]. According to [[bitch|Sarah]], Bristol will marry the babydaddy or be forced to live out the rest of her life in a brothel in India. [[Barack Obama|Democrats]] quickly issued a statement saying, "Enjoy your life, whore. Unless you cunt-punch your mom.  Then one of us will take pity and [[parents|adopt]] you." It is uncertain at this time whether Bristol has agreed to this.

From the AP news wire:
"Bristol and the young man (known only as [[John Edwards|J. Edwards]]) she will marry are going to realize very quickly the difficulties of raising a child, which is why they will have the love and support of our entire family," they added.

In a desperate grasp at last minute damage control, Sarah pube-licly announced the news about her daughter, proving that abstinence works! It just goes to show that [[bullshit|if you sink billions of dollars into telling teenagers not to have sex because it makes Christ cry, you can expect quality results!]]

{{quote|'''Life happens'''|McCain spokesman Steve Schmidt}} 

Bold, comforting, experienced, proactive words from the McCain/Palin 2008 "WTF" campaign.

When asked to comment, Michele Obama stated "What a bunch of niggas. Bitch ought to teach her girl to close her huskie legs."

The jury is still out as to whether or not Bristol will spend the rest of her pregnancy in Juneau.

==Personally Drilled (aka [[The Incident]])==

<i>See main article [[gov.palin@yahoo.com|here]].</i>

Sarah Palin is an avid user of [[Yahoo|Yahoo! Mail]] for [[SFB|state business]]. On the evening of 16 September 2008 a member of the [[Paultards|left wing activist group]] the [[Anonymous|Internet Hate Machine]] gained access to her account by initiating the password reset question, which was [[fucktard|brilliantly]] set to "What is my ZIP code?"  

While the Anon proved himself to be a [[newfag]] by freaking out and turning the password over to /b/, Palin's contact list was published across the [[Internets]] allowing anyone and everyone to send pictures of [[Goatse|themselves]] to Alaska's power elite. 

The emails themselves are fairly [[meh]], except for a correspondence between Sarah and her personal [[AIDS|aide]], Ivy Frye. There, they discuss how to cover up the fact that Sarah used her personal email account to conduct serious government business instead of her official government account. And that her husband had [[Hilary Clinton|near-limitless access to his wife's clout]], which he abused heavily.

The Department of Justice framed David Kernell for the hacking is pulling out all the stops trying to give this kid the [[permaban|maximum sentence]] while conveniently ignoring that his prank exposed corruption in Palin's office. God bless Amurrca!

There were some pictures too. Notice how close Daddy Palin's hand is to his daughter's oil well. Ick. 

[[Image:Ha ha my baby isn't retarded mom2.jpg|thumb|Stop making fun of your <s>little brother</s> son, Bristol.]]

===[http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/09/palin-retains-l.html Troopergate]===
It appears that despite being touted as a fearless crusader against '[[bullshit|politics as usual]]' and government [[corruption]], she had her brother-in-law - an Alaskan State trooper - fired after a nasty divorce with her sister. She also voted '''for''' [[Ted Stevens|"The Bridge To Nowhere"]].

Update: Despite resisting subpoenas into the matter, the First Dude just came forward admitting that he was the one responsible for having [[shit nobody cares about|Public Safety Commissioner]] Walter Monegan fired. While admitting MASSIVE BUTTHURT about his trooper brother-in-law (for several years, it seems like it was all he ever talked about), he still claims that Monegan was fired for [[bullshit|legitimate reasons]]. Whether this is true or just a [[doing it wrong|pathetic attempt]] to absolve his wife from blame, his attempts to justify firing Monegan are high-grade lulz. His reasons:
*Monegan reported that the Eskimilf had been seen driving around with her retard-baby not secured in a proper carseat
*He wouldn't let Failin take the state troopers' plane for a joyride

Not only was humiliating herself with her retarded kids and forcing her 17 year old kid to have babies, and [[LOL|talking at the media about the super important parts of her vice presidency.]] She just recently decided to slander Alaskas name with the inaccurately named show "Sarah Palins Alaska" Where you get to watch her walk around like a fucking retard in various places that <strike> no one has ever gone before</strike> Tourists go to every year. 

She requested [[over 9000| hundreds of thousands of dollars]] for her show just proving that she's still just a gold digging whore that needs to be cunt punched back to Idaho where she came from. 


She broke records in how fast the ratings fell after the premier of the show. 
It dropped so much that news articles were wrote about how fast the ratings fell. It dropped by 44% by the second airing. 
The remaining 56% of the people that continued to watch her be a whore on ice where men ranging from 57 to 60 which was also commented on in news articles. [[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ratings-collapse-for-sarah-palins-alaska/|Link]]

Heavy Quitter Palin ventured out of the kitchen long enough to regale the American public with the tale of the 'death panels' that would supposedly be unleashed on her Downsy child by the health-insurance reform legislation backed by the Obama administration.  This was a grossly inaccurate reading of the relevant provision of the act, but one quite understandable as a simple ms-hearing once it is known that the bill as currently framed would mandate summary medical execution for <strong>[[/b/]]</strong>tards.

'''Palin/Beck''' is the unholy union of [[Sarah Palin]] and her [[BFF]] fanboi [[Glenn Beck]] (or visa versa) that [[Teabaggers]] and [[Randroids]] pray to [[God]] for [[wet dream|every night]] to run for [[president|office]] in [[2012]] to wrestle back the [[USA]] from the evil [[Commie]] state that [[The Jewnited States]] has become after two years of tyrannical rule under [[Comrade Obama]].

[[Some argue]] that the [[Mayans]] predicted this horrendous coupling when they compiled their calendar that avers that the world will indeed end in [[2012]] when they -obviously- get elected by the retarded masses in America.

This [[creepypasta|horrific scenario]] could only get any worse if these two children of Satan mated and spawned millions of little Gremlin [[teabaggers]]. That said, seeing as Glenn Beck is a drug-addled alky and Sarah Palin is hawt if you're wearing [[goggles|beer goggles]], it's only a matter of time.
