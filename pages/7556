Skript Kiddies, Script Kiddies, s'Kiddies, or Script Kittens are individuals who go about trying to cause things to happen using computers that, are either frowned upon, unexpected, or malicious in nature. The tragedy of the typical script kiddie is that he approaches software the way a priest approaches the eucharist: he is so in awe at the magic of [[computer]]s, that he looks to it like a sacrament from [[God]].  He therefore does not have the patience or the mental stamina to 'hack', and so uses the scripts and programs developed by others to wreak havoc on those lazy bums who cannot bother to secure their systems. 

Most script kiddies spend most of their time on [[IRC]] (usually from g00ns, #calmdown on anonnet) trumpeting their [[1337]] [[h4X0r]]ing [[skillz]].  They are usually teenagers looking for social acceptance through the [[internets]].  The majority of script kiddies are boys, but there are a few boys pretending to be girls around as well.  Naturally, since most of these kids are too nerdy to get a date [[IRL]], gaining the attention of the opposite sex is often the motive for much script kiddie exploits.  Crews are formed, alliances shift, jealousies inflame -- all for a little fame that the rest of the world is oblivious towards.

To call someone a script kiddie is usually to insult their intelligence, saying to the person: 'you wish to be considered a hacker, but you cannot teach yourself to [[puberty|develop]] the tools necessary to accomplish what you want'. 

Script kiddies are known for [[blanking]] [[wiki]] pages and writing <span style="text-decoration: blink">U GOT HAXED.</span> They also find it very fun to [[exploit]] coding vulnerabilities.

==Skript kiddie fashion and habits==
Due to their usually underaged b& status, skript kiddies have an obsessive tendency towards:
*making things look obnoxious in an [[ADHD]] way, meaning blinking text, animated backgrounds, and horrible forced technomusic that has nothing to do with a keygen program.
*Using overly "cool" and "industrial" things like phosphor green, consoles, naïve admiration of cyber-punk, and ''Matrix''-style hero complexes.

Where this differs from your twenty-something or thirty-something hacker/coder/IT-specialist is its obsessive nature and the disconnection between the pragmatic origin (eg. phosphor screens: reality on Apple II, console: faster to write a [[command line|CLI]] than a [[GUI]]) of the phenomenon and its superficial advertisement and bricolage. Skript kiddies use these things as a status symbol, like the(now dethroned) leading fucks of [[Moldova|Soviet Union]] used the hammer and sickle.



Some have to learn the hard way.

Most of them are batch scripts full of false command and unnecessary pauses to make it look like it actually works.
