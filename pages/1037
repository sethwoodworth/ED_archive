[[File:BlocklandPenis.png|thumb|''Blockland'' has something for those with a [[macrophile|macro]] fetish too.]]

A [[fail|successful]] attempt at creating something with even worse graphics than ''[[Minecraft]]'', '''''Blockland''''' is a high-quality [[FPS]] made by some [[lie|hardworking developer]] known as [[G spot|Badspot]]. In ''Blockland'', a player can hang out and build [[lame|cool]] things with [[awesome]] features! Sadly, it is instead another game that tries to replicate Legos making it somewhat the most inferior Lego [[sim]] in the universe, but unsurprisingly equally shitty. The only [[lulz]] in ''Blockland'' is the constant arguing and battles between another useless game known as ''[[Roblox]]'' and themselves, which ends up in [[IRL]] [[war]]s and [[drama]]s between [[retards|special needs]] [[jailbait|children]]. The only use for ''Blockland'' is for keeping the autistic kids in games instead of letting them lurk IRL.

== ''Blockland'' Forums ==
[[File:BlocklandForums.JPG|thumb|Typical ''Blockland'' discussion.]]
The forum consists mainly of children under the age of 14, like in [[the game]]. The forum has slowly degenerated into a /[[b/]]oard, with [[trollface]] making an appearance in almost every thread. The forum is run by Badspot, aka 29-year-old [[South Park|Eric Hartman]], your average [[virgin]] [[basement-dweller]]. When he isn't spending time [[ban]]ning [[trolls]], he's eating Mexican and fingering herself to [[hentai]].

Some ''Blockland'' players are [[Macfag]]s and still can't get the game to work <strike>sometimes</strike>, which is strange because [[jk|Macs just work]]. ''Blockland'' only [[i did it for the lulz|works on the latest version of Mac OSX too]], so older OSX versions can't even run the game resulting in whiny 12-year-olds who can't get their parents to dish out $20 for an [[scam|Apple Software Upgrade]].

The forum has a [[drama]] section for [[n00bs]] to [[bawww]] about their fellow 11 year old players and to spark [[flame war]]s with other players who made them [[butthurt]] for [[lulz]]. When they aren't flaming each other, they're talking about the creator's penis and how they would suck it right off of him. [http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=112632.0 Srsly]. They won't be fed much, though.

The forum has a gallery for the terrible creations made by the [[newfag| players]] of the game. To protect their feelings, Badspot enforced a [http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=3622.0 rule] where any negative comments about their pixelated, untextured shit will get that person banned.

=== ''Blockland'' vs. ''Roblox'' ===
[[File:BlocklandGrx.png|thumb|left|This is the actual [[lulwat|graphical experience]] of Blockland, which players actively [[White knight|defend]].]]

There is a constant war between ''Blockland'' users and ''Roblox'' users in the form of a superiority complex, e.g. members will spam each others' sites with insults such as "ur game sux lol". All ''Blockland'' players know that the [[lol|superb graphics]] in the game are superior to ''Roblox'', and that they paid $20 for the keg of shit that is a Lego clone. [[PROTIP]]: The ''Blockland'' community is usually the one flipping their shit the most, so it's much easier to troll them by just mentioning ''[[Roblox]]''.

The sad thing is that on the "[http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?board=32.0 games]" board, it's impossible to find one topic per page that isn't about [[minecraft]] showing you that blockland users care more about minecraft than the game they white knight daily.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:SuperiorGraphics.jpg|thumb|Our graphics are WAY SUPERIOR, guise!!![[1]]]]

''Blockland'' is a [[MMO|multiplayer]] game, most servers being [[roleplay]] servers, since building things out of massive Legos is so like IRL. The kiddies on the game have so little fun from building things it usually ends up in them [[ragequit]]ting from working too hard. That's right, the game's player audience is mostly underage B& [[sarcasm|making the experience so much more enjoyable.]] The build servers are usually full of 14-year-olds building [[faggot|penises]] or [[virgin|naked anime characters]].

An easy way to [[troll]] is to gain administration privileges, usually just by being nice to the owner and complimenting him/<strike>her</strike>  frequently. Once you're an admin, [[pwnt|Permaban]] everyone when the owner of the server or the other administrators [[Fap|aren't there]]. If you do this professionally, you will obtain an excessive amount of [[lulz]] and might be able to get a drama topic [[9001|9003]] pages long.

Notice how all the characters have no legs at all. This was the creator's attempt at making the game original, by making players into [[cripples]].

== Servers ==
[[File:Blockland34.png|thumb|''Blockland'' [[rule 34]]]]

There are around 220 servers for this [[extreme]] vidya game, with a wide selection of [[boring|interesting]] game modes to keep you occupied. Most of them are [[roleplay]] servers, though the people who can actually afford a good computer may rarely host something somewhat fun.

=== Gamemodes ===
*'''Family RP''', where [[so ronery|the lonely]] hang out and pretend to be a mother, father, uncle, etc, much like [[babyfurs]] do with their so-called families (though without the [[incest]] [[yiff]]) just because they got [[GET OUT|disowned]] from their family [[IRL]].
*'''Jail RP''' is a team deathmatch-based minigame where guards must [[divide by zero|let prisoners out of their cells without letting them escape or get weapons]]. The minigame is popular with the cocksuckers who bought this shit, since it's the only game mode where you actually have to use strategy.
*'''City RP''' is where players have to get a [[prostitution|job]] and build shit to survive. Most of the time, it's just idiots killing each other and [[kthxbai|ragequitting]].

The servers on which the game runs on are owned by kids whose [[stupid|unfortunate]] parents don't secure their [[PayPal]] details. End result, even [[moar]] cancer to hit the Interbutts.

== Older Versions ==
[[File:Pic 00126.png|thumb|Yes, TBM players are actually this [[Dying Alone|lonely]]]]
[[File:131.png|thumb|Protip: Never go AFK ]]

Once in a [[2004|time long past]], G-Spot was working on the alpha version of Blockland (Vanilla), which was released in November of that same year. Eventually, it got a lot of players who modded the shit out of the game. There are many mods of Vanilla, the most popular one being "Return to Blockland", which pretty much gives you 4 shitty vehicles that glitch and crash you with use, some gay accessories, and a [[Dildo|magic plastic stick]] that [[Roblox|makes your bricks bigger / longer]]. It used to have a large community of members, but after the actual game released the community started going to shit. Eventually, a cocksucker by the name of "Vyper" came along and made his own forums for the game. It lasted from 2007 to 2008 before dieing out. He attempted to get more money by telling his 200 member community that they're retarded and expected people to give him money. The domain went out as of 2009, but was later replaced with another forum called "AndoRTB". The sad thing is [[statistics|99.9]] of the posts rest in the "Off-Topic" section, just like on the actual forums. It was fun having plastic orgies, though. Feeling lucky? Play it then! [http://www.filefront.com/13842622/Return-to-Blockland-1.045/ Have fun playing online.]

Another version is called TBM ([[Irony|The Better Mod]]), made by a group of basement dwellers. All later mods were made by [[13 year old boy|14 year olds]] <strike>script kiddies</strike> fags who stole code, vehicles, and pretty much everything else from RTB and SFM. The only thing that separates it is the "i-gob" which lets you save bricks and load them on any other server. The community still exists, but it's mainly full of [[truth|furfags who can't afford 20 bucks to buy the actual game]]. The community has made plenty of mods. DTB, TOB, TBG, etc. Back in 2005, it was discovered that TBM fucked up other blockland files and if you tried to take any code as well. In retaliation, Badspot decided to manipulate most of his fanfags into keeping people from playing TBM. But who can really blame him? 

Also, a project that was going on since [[Last Thursday|2005]] called "The Better Game" was supposed to compete with Retail. When Retail eventually came out, the project was [[fail|canceled]] until sometime in 2009, Cyberprime and some other fags decided they'd work on it. It's TBM on another engine (Still Outdated) and some shitty maps. With T3D on sale for 99$ They have been trying to raise enough money to buy it.

== Drama ==
The lifeline of the ''Blockland'' forums revolves around the [http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?board=31.0 Drama Section]. The Drama Section is the third most popular board in ''Blockland'''s forums, aside from Off-Topic and Games, proving that ''Blockland'' players are about three times more interested in anything not related to ''Blockland''. It is also the forum with the highest Reply-to-Thread Ratio, indicating that anything posted here will undoubtedly result in at least 10 pages of idiots bickering with each other over trivial [[shit nobody cares about]].

Drama made in ''Blockland'' is usually so stale and lifeless that even the assholes that inhabit the forums have trouble making a big deal about it. This phenomenon is so problematic that Badspot made it a [http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=62550.0 Bannable Offense] to make a comment about how you [[cool story bro|don't care]]. Regardless of how prominent this rule is (having a sticky thread all to its self), most drama is so terrible this rule has claimed many victims who could not restrain themselves from posting a yawn. The people that create the majority of threads are those with an [[USI|unwarranted sense of self importance]] bitching about abstract ideas and forum trends that literally could not be less important if it did not exist at all.

Regardless of how uninteresting the average thread is, with a community as hostile and immature as ''Blockland'''s, more than a few people have gone down in  flames so bright they deserve to have their failures to be cataloged here for all eternity.

=== Robo and Slick ===
[[File:BlocklandMiikaAss.jpg|thumb|right|Miika did a [[Fat Girl Angle Shot]] on her [[lulwat|ass]].]]
[[File:Miikafat.jpg|thumb|right|Miika on the left, what she looks like with out the angle shot.]]
[[Attention whore]] [[obvious troll|Jimmg]] posted a topic about Slicksilver [[pwnt|banning]] his [[bro]] Robo [[Noob]] after he forgot to pay him for the [[whore]] he bought. The topic unfolded in a mass of fake suicide, nudes being spread, and fun times.
<!-- Someone needs to redo this section because it makes no sense at-fucking-all if you don't know about the drama. A link to the original thread would be nice. I put Miika's ass under here because, AFAIK, this is where it originated. Still, I'm unsure, so if you know more than me please contribute -->

=== Zoneark and Truce: Skiddie Trolls ===
[[File:BeccaBlocklandSchool.jpg|thumb|right|Becca went topless on cam for Miika's boyfriend. Her tits resemble moon craters.]]
Truce made a client script that gave him direct console access on servers. He and Zoneark did this just to clear some bricks, ban random people, and otherwise cause chaos "for luls". Badspot finally caught on and demanded they tell him what is the cause of this. Zoneark blamed it on Iban's zombie mod, which Badspot was quick to judge as complete shit and instead targeted McTwist's RP Core mod as the source. Zoneark, Truce, and Only1Rebel (whom had not appeared in either the forums or game for over a year), along with three other "unknown" users, had [[GET OUT|their keys de-activated]]. This has been going on for two whole weeks before Badspot even took action. Many butthurt players ragequitted from ''Blockland'' because their shit that they spent hours on was deleted forever.

=== [[GOTIS|.Aeris.]]: Smalltime Gambler ===
[[File:AerisBL.jpg|thumb|Aeris now owes each ED user, either [[sysop]] or [[noob]], $20.]]
[[File:Aerisnude.png|thumb|right|Aeris being the whore that she is has uploaded several nude photos on various websites.]]
Recently, another challenger appeared to the throne of spreading nudes on ''Blockland''. Aeris spread dem titties to her 'friends' on the forums, and Jimmg, of Robo and Slick fame, caught on, which led to more drama and arguing. Then Aeris was promptly banned after breaking a rule by claiming [[irony|she had better things to do than argue on a forum]]. Three days later, she was unbanned. Small arguments between her and other members of the community continue to happen sporadically.


Despite several warning from [[White Knight|more caring members of the community]], [[User:.Aeris.|.Aeris.]] has made several efforts to add to this article and show the basement dwelling peasants of Encyclopedia Dramatica that is she is actually just a [[jailbait|defenseless young girl]] that has never done anything wrong, ever, and everyone who does not like her just spontaneously decided to do so (probably because she is so [[kawaii|super cute]] and they are jealous because they don't have a girlfriend). [[Special:Contributions/.Aeris.|Her revisions]] include revising this subsection to reflect [[USI|better on her and more poorly on the rest of the community]], and adding an aside under the below picture [[USI|demanding that ED find the pictures of her naked]]. She also registered [[User:SneakyShit|another account]] and tried [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Blockland&oldid=1998638454 to add a piece about Jimmg] (the person who pointed out how many nude pictures she had given out). Unfortunately for her, these revisions were undone by SysOps, meaning that the bullshit she tried to add was so flagrantly retarded that people whom have never played ''Blockland'' and were not involved in the incident could clearly see what a crock of [[shit]] it was.

Recently, .Aeris. '''took a fucking hint''' and had one of the prepubescent boys she gave nudes to [http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=134608.msg3043449#msg3043449 post] that she is leaving. [[Lie|This is probably a sincere notice letting her friends know that she will no longer be active in the forums and it is very unlikely that she is doing this for attention.]]

[http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=134608.msg3050197#msg3050197 In a chat with Visage], .Aeris. revealed that [[Bullshit|she was a spy part of a group of /b/tards on Blockland to troll and take over Blockland]]. If all of these /b/tards are as successful as her, the forums should be under their control by next week

[[File:Coughup.png|thumb|center|600px|There is an invisible portion of this image that only Aeris can see that says it has to be a specific picture of her.  Other invisible things she sees include her belief that she is not an attention whore and that people find her funny and intelligent.]]

=== MegaScience: [[jk|Savior of Women]]===
[[File:Whatafuckingretard.png|thumb|right|Megascience, effectively creating drama whilst stating he is finding some that is "better". [[gg]] dipshit]]
Over the course of the past few days the user [[User:MegaScience|MegaScience]] has been trying to secretly vandalize this article because he came across a half-nude pic of a [[loli|girl]] he loves. Now, knowing Megascience and [[White_Knight|WhiteKnights]], once they don't get their way they go and cry about it, such as he did over at [http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=134363.0 Blockland's forums].

According to ''Blockland'''s own community, MegaScience is known for being the biggest suckup to females on the site. Whenever you can, please remind him that he'll never get laid and removing pictures of his many girly friends will take him even further away from any [[CWC|china]] he'll ever know.

Let's not forget how much he'll ask you to add him on various IMs if you somewhat agree with him on something. Status = [[Forever Alone]].

|I admit I hate an immaturity that makes me coddle to females, with teenaged hormones blazing. But I still feel the want to defend them from other assholes. I might be just as much a jerk, but if I can be the lesser of evils... Then I won't be destine to live in my parents house my whole life having done nothing for anyone.|MegaScience, trying to justify his actions with "hormones" despite being 17 years old, 4 years past the time these events happen.

=== [[Faggot|Metal]] ===
[[Image:Metal.jpeg|thumb|Metal at his day job.]]
Metal also known as Metalmario is an [[homosexual|ultrafaggot]] who strives to set the world record for sucking the most [[dick]] in one hour.  He claims he must gargle cock continually due to a [[Because of my syndrome|medical condition]].  This was [[lie|not true]] initially but he has become so hopelessly [[addicted]] to cock that he will go into a fatal withdrawal if he doesn't have at least one [[dick]] in his mouth and two in his hands at all times. His buttbuddy is a faggot named [[homosexual|Lewnaja]] who does nothing but [[lemonparty|suck his penis]] every chance he gets.

You can find him at any time of the day practicing his [[deepthroat]] technique at the local [[homeless]] shelter.

=== Furries ===
[[File:Blockland_Yiff_In_Hell.png|frame|423px|right]]
Very rarely does a community have all negative traits, but ''Blockland'' strives for perfection. One of the most agonizing traits of ''Blockland'''s community is its tolerance to Furries. Even ''[[Roblox]]'' has a rule against anything related to the fandom, including user-made [[neko|cat ears]] and other gay accessories. Even though the founder and only admin of the board appears to be anti-furry, he is too fucking lazy to do anything about it. Despite how most of the community doesn't even want the furries to stay there, they willingly prance around with avatars cut from [[hentai]] and signatures with nothing but soft-core porn in a mild, yet effective, effort at [[trolling]] the entire user base.

== Badspot's "Secret" Website ==
The users of ''Blockland'' forums [[I accidentally|accidentally]] discovered Badspot's alternate website, thus they started a thread about it on the forums. This topic started out nicely just showing everyone that their favorite games developer is actually a [[sick fuck]] by linking them to his personal cartoon [[porn]] website, which was full of sex "transformation" animations, and comics. In retaliation Baddy decided to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]] and the poster was banned for 2 weeks.

This was an example of overreacting as the website was never deleted - it was just moved somewhere else. You can find it [http://satinminions.com/index.html here].

Unfortunately, all of the comics look the same, or feature shitty attempts at "Art". Poor fag never got laid.

<Strike>*[http://supertoxic.net/files/Hosted_Files/BADSPOTS_HIDDEN_PORN_SITE/ The original thread before it got moved]</Strike>

== Trolling ==
[[File:tree spam.png|thumb|Magical trees, magical trees everywhere]]

Trolling these [[13-year-old_boy|young studs]] is as easy as pouring a [[Jenkem|drink]], all you have to do is either make a [[Newbie|hello topic]] and they'll start trying to guess if you're an [[Attention whore|alternate account]] or not; The other way is to go into one of the many [[Shit|various]] add-on topics and tell the maker how much he sucks at making them, or you could make a huge [[Goatse]] macro and start a server like we did so it shows up on the main site.
[[File:BlocklandGoatseTroll.png|center|500px|How it's done]]

Random players will spam your server 95% of the time. They do this for a chance of crashing the server so they can gain e-peen. An average server can only handle up to 20,000 bricks with out lagging/crashing.

== Machinimas ==
[[File:Blocklandmachinimadrama.png|thumb|Lulzy reactions to a ''Blockland'' Machinima]]

As with any [[Halo|shitty hyped-up game]], there are [[machinima|Machinimas]] for ''Blockland''. Putting Machinima and ''Blockland'' together is like combining kids with [[Fap|Fraps]] and [[Uncyclopedia|unfunny]]. End result - a movie with [[Jews did WTC|almost pointless plots]] and adultish voices, e.g. 10-year-olds speaking through tissues. Srsly.

== ''Blockland'' players on this article ==
When ''Blockland'' forum-goers found this ED article, some fag named [[Ninja Gaiden|Ninja Guy]] made a topic and it resulted in a [[lollercoaster]] of accusations. Players eager to defend the [[lol|powerful]] graphics and gameplay of ''Blockland'' created accounts to blank the page backed up by the [[white knight]]ing of [[Special:Contributions/HoudiniGal|HoudiniGal]].

People who have blanked this article include:
*[[User:EvilJebus]] - Replaced with "[[I am 12 years old and what is this]]"
*[[User:AlphaX100]] - [[Retard|Removed every section one by one]].
*[[User:China Wolbert]] - Replaced the article with crap but was reverted by [[MysteryBot]] immediately.
*[[User:MetalBL]] - Pulling yet even moar whiteknightism.
*[[User:.Aeris.]] - Didn't like the fact that she was [[pwned]] by the community she was in.
*[[User:MegaScience]] - Repeatedly attempted to get a pic down through trying to mask his edits, forgetting that ''Blockland'' members seem to love ED (and furthermore, hate him).
*[[User:SionB7|MegaScience's sock]].
