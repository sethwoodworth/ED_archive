'''Amy "Wino" Crackhouse'''Jew (née Amilée Chateau in Frenchese) is a drug-addled, [[alcoholic]] [[Jewish]] [[attention whore]] [[wigger]] from England known less for her [[whore|sultry]] jazz singing and moar for being a self-destructive [[drama queen]] of [[Pete Doherty]] proportions. When people see her, they yell "Who let this ugly piece of shit in here?". As tactfully pointed out by Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle, Amy looks like a RSPCA promo poster for neglected horses. [[The Man|They]] tried to make her go to [[rehab]], but she said "no, no, no" and instead went to the bank with a load of [[cash]] up her [[butt]] from exploiting her own [[fail|vulnerabilities]].  Musically, she is influenced entirely by [[Nigra|black]] [[music]], first 'borrowing' [[Old School|classic]] smoky jazz-club stylings for her first album and then stealing the Motown classics [[tracing|note-for-note]] on her second.

==Musical Career==
[[Image:Amy Winehousecig.jpg|thumb|portrait of a lady.]]
To date, Winehouse has released two CDs of her [[retard]]ed warbling.  The first, entitled "Frank" was released in 2003 and legend has it that if you play both albums backwards they sound very fucking similar.  Someone had to call the [[911|wahhhhmbulance]] because her managers wanted her to go to a [[prison|rehabilitation facility]] for being a [[drunk|drunken]] [[whore]].  Her reply?  Not "no, no, no" this time, but she did write a repetitious song about it that [[forced meme|everyone went batshit over]].  This single is proof, once again, that Jews are in charge of the record industry, and that they can make ''anything'' a hit.

==Family Life==

Luckily for this [[pro-ana]] trainwreck, she has a highly supportive network of family members.  Stand-up citizens include:

===The Husband===
Honest and caring husband, Blake Fielder-Civil is currently enjoying the company of [[Bubba]], in Prison, due to a [[fail]]ed attempt to intimidate witnesses, [[pervert]]ing the course of justice, and being a [[Domestic_violence|tough guy]].  After enjoying the attention of his fellow [[Vinny_the_Rapist|inmates]] for a few months [[some_argue|many believe]] that any attraction Blake had for Amy will immediately [[Divide_by_zero|vanish]], only to be replaced by a powerful and primal urge for [[buttsecks|anal violation]].

Apparently Blake's love of the [[Money|folding]] is strong indeed, desperate to stay on the wino gravytrain he's asking for [[Over_nine_thousand|$6,000,000]] in a divorce settlement.  Chances of this happening are slim (though not as [[anorexia|slim as Winehouse]]) due to the difficulty of extracting [[Jew_gold|Jew gold]].  Although, he may have a case for spousal abuse:

===Her Father===
Her father Mitch appears to crave the [[Hookers_and_blow|bright lights and endless attention]] of the [[Internet Celebrity|celebrity]] life too! Aware that life might be tough for Amy he is seeking to have her [[Insane#Batshit_Crazy|committed]] to a [[hugbox|safe environment]].  When faced with the charge that he may be at least partially responsible for her 'problems' he simply replies "[[No_u|No U]]" Sadly Mitch is neither a [[Leet|talented]] [[music]]ian and is notable only because of the [[lolcow]] which he spawned.

{{quote|I want her sectioned. The situation is getting out of control. I want her off the [[Prostitute|street]]. I don't think being somewhere (in [[rehab]]) for six weeks is going to cure her problems. I think it needs far more [[Last_measure|radical measures]].|Mitch Winehouse, on his daughter|http://breakingnews.iol.ie/entertainment/story.asp?j=19419426&p=y94y948x}}

==Winehouse OTI==

===[[Perez Hilton]]===
Famed internets [[faggot]] Perez Hilton has become completely and uncontrollably obsessed with this dumb [[alcoholic]] whore for no apparent reason. Despite the existence of [[Lindsay Lohan|much more famous crazy bitches]] he posts shit about Amy Winehouse constantly, giving her much more publicity than she deserves. [[ALL CAPS|WE ALREADY KNOW SHE'S A DUMB WHORE, WE DON'T HAVE TO BE TOLD EVERY 5 MINUTES]].

===Amy Winehouse Goes Straight===
Recently it was revealed that Amy Winehouse has quit drugs and alcohol, and is no longer in trouble with the law.  In fact, [[Wikipedia:Amy Winehouse|according to Wikipedia]], Mrs. Winehouse has [[BLP|never had any substance abuse problems nor has she ever committed a crime]].  It was all apparently just a typical tabloid smear campaign and [[Lie|none of those things ever really happened]]. 

===She's an [[adult baby]]!===
[[Image:Amywinehouseadultbaby.jpg|thumb|The paparazzi get in position for the [[money shot]], only to be [[cock block]]ed by a device used to control incontinence, normal everyday wear for toddlers, and, apparently, drug addled twenty-something women.]]
According to a completely accurate [[valleywag|celebrity blog]] recently, Amy Winehouse had taken to wearing "nappies", an [[England|English]] term for diapers:

{{squote|Prepare to [[irony|fall in love]] with Amy Winehouse all over again, as a [[German]] newspaper is reporting today that she has now begun to wear a diaper whenever she leaves the house. It’s a [[hot]] image, yes? Just the idea of Amy Winehouse, [[drunk]] and [[high ]]and slurring her already [[english|indecipherable]] accent. "Oh bugger, I've gone an' soiled my knickers I have."|OH SHI-}}

Oh god, I can’t be the only one who is [[fapfapfap|totally turned on right now]].
