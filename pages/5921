Obese
{{FYI|[[oxymoron|England's public health]] minister says [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10789553 that the 'obese' should be called "fat"!]}}

{{needsmore|merging into the [[fat]] article}}

To be obese one needs to be a little fatter than [[fat]]. It is mostly used by scientists so don't expect to ever use phrases such as ''"You betta get yo obese ass down here"''.

Clan of obesity, it's serious business. 

Look at this [[fat]] [[anti-lulz]] [[Faggot]] (He looks kinda liek the guy from "Teh addams family" [[amirite]]?. Also, he knows about ffffffffloorchan.)

Fat people are OK. Obese people are not... You know yourself, Lyle.
