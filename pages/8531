[[Trey Burba]] is a [[13_year_old_boy|15-year-old]] gun enthusiast from Pflugerville, [[Texas|TX]] and [[B|/b/tard]], and like most /b/tards, he is total underage b&. This one-hit wonder was best known for [[fail]]ing to kill dozens of his fellow students at PHS on [[9/11|September 11th]], 2007. He was arrested shortly after announcing his plans to [[4chan]]'s&nbsp;[[b|/b/]].

== The Pflugerville High School Bomb Threat ==
Soon after midnight on the morning of September 11th, 2007, [[Anonymous]] posted the [http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=39101047 following threat] to [[4chan]]'s [[b|/b/]].

|}

This was followed by the usual faggotry to a [[Jake Brahm|4chan bomb threat]], ranging from "''[[In b4]] [[FBI|V&]]''" and "''Posting in an [[epic]] thread''" replies to practical concerns like "''WTF are you using [[plastic crap|PVC]] for a pipe [[bomb]]?''"

== 15 Minutes Later... ==

lol way to leave the exif data on the camera

Camera Owner Name: Terry Burba

I will let you do the rest /b/

Apparently, Trey simply took a photo of his fake pipe bomb with his dad's digital camera, imported it into the computer, and from there, uploaded it straight to [[4chan]]. While the usual EXIF metadata for this photo didn't contain anything incriminating, there was an embedded block of Canon Makernotes. This backup cache of data, created the moment the picture is taken, identified the owner of the camera as Terry Burba.

'''Terry "[[Bubba]]" Burba''' (terry@dbl-tap.com) is your typical Central [[Texas]] gun and knife nut. You can find all sorts of interesting articles on his website, [http://www.dbl-tap.com www.dbl-tap.com] , including his letter to Santa: "[http://www.dbl-tap.com/yineedar.htm Why I Need An Assault Rifle]". You can also visit his [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=87284800 <s>MySpace page</s>] (cancelled). Several other websites point to his accomplishments as a marksman and his work as a tech evangelist.

Unsurprisingly, his son Trey Burba (trey_burba@yahoo.com) has a [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=68618030 <s>MySpace page</s>] featuring an angry little photo of him posing with his guns. He regularly posts in various forums as "Numbuh 15", a name that references the "''Codename: Kids Next Door''" cartoon, watta fag.

2 minutes later after his dad's name was discovered, Trey posted [http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=39101047#39102469 the following message] to /b/:

THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS.

So, [[it was a social experiment|my little experiment]] was a sucess after all. 6 Moths ago, /b/ would have been nothing but supportive, and help to keep a low profile over the feds, and possibly porvide addresses to nearby surplus stores.

Now, with all the newfags, we get THIS.

You CALLED the damn SCHOOL. Way to fucking go, '[[Internet Hate Machine]]'.</font>

== Meanwhile, Back In Pflugerville... ==
[[Image:Pflugerville bomb note.gif|thumb|Take one, pass it down.]]
Pflugerville HS and the [[FBI|feds]] were notified early that morning by at least 3 different [[faggots|/b/tard-wannabes]], and by 5:00 am they had brought in the [[Buy a dog|dogs]] and started their search for a bomb. During this time, [[Internet_police|cybercrime agents]] say they were [[lie|busy at work]] investigating the identity of the terrorist in question.

[[Image:Bullshit.gif|frame||center|Taking way too much credit there, guys.]]

== Arrest ==
Trey was arrested that morning and charged with making a terrorist threat (3rd degree felony) and a bomb threat (misdemeanor). [[at_least_100|At least 100]] police officers kept watch over the school for the rest of the day. [[Jake Brahm|Nobody]] got to mess with [[football]], and those scary teenagers in Pflugerville live to see another day.

== Local News Video ==

None of the news reports have mentioned his name.

==Lulz lost or gained?==
At the time of Burba's [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|downfall]], some [[/b/tards]] felt that [[anonymous|Anon]] had failed in its mission to spread lulz by not helping Burba. Instead, they [[John Locke|fucked his shit up]] by calling the [[4chan]] [[partyvan]]. However, Anonymous is capricious, and [[psychopath|Trey]] was as good a target as a school of [[retard|Texans]]. Burba came to 4chan expecting either help or a positive reaction to his [[Lie|test]]...  Anonymous realized that he was just an [[attention whore]], and ruining him was much more entertaining than just another fucking [[lemon party|school shooting]]; besides, indirectly causing a school shooting is neither difficult nor rewarding ([[I did it for the lulz|unless in cases when it's done for the lulz]]) as provoking [[emo|emo fags]] is like shooting razor-scarred fish in a barrel. 
<br>And let's face it; /b/ is not your personal army, no one should expect the assistance of all. If this is indeed the work of what [[/b/]] calls '[[noob|newfags]]', then perhaps it is the first lulzy thing they have ever done. With the prophecy nearly fulfilled, [[Catnarok]] may be nigh.
Alternatively, don't name the fucking school you're going to blow up and [[copypasta]] the photo to a new image file to remove EXIF information. Anon failing to deliver an explosion should always be seen as a fail.

Like many [[fucktards]] of his caliber (lol, gun-nut [[faggot]]), Trey is notably incapable of following his own advice.

== Lives Were Saved (But Not Really) ==
On December 21, 2007, the [[FBI]] [http://www.fbi.gov/page2/dec07/tips122107.html posted a story on its front page] using the incident to [[Unwarranted_self-importance|glorify itself]]  and give them full credit for discovering Burba's identity and saving the lives of students.


{{squote|Time was of the essence; we had to stop this plot before the school day began in just a few short hours. They checked out the student website, but a vital piece of information—the photographs of the attackers—had already been removed. Time was running out.|Feds|}}

{{squote|That photograph paid off. It enabled the Pflugerville Police Department, the Pflugerville Independent School District, and our local field office to identify the student in the photograph and arrest him and his co-conspirators without incident before the school day started. Whew!|Feds|}}


In addition, the [[btard|/b/tard]] who notified the feds [[You_win_the_prize|received a special commendation]] from the [[The Man|FBI Director]].


{{squote|It was at this point that he delivered in an even more remarkable and important way.|Anonymous Delivers!!|}}


==Young Trey's Life Now==

According to [[Anonymous]] sources, Trey has been [[Some argue|allegedly]] charged with a [[buttsecks|felony]] and sentenced to three months of house arrest. Also expelled from his school, naturally. It looks like [[poor|an eternity of bagging groceries at Food Lion]] is the best this young [[winner]] can hope for in life.

Update: [[Shit_Nobody_Cares_About|I go to school with this idiot, and guess what, HE'S BACK! No longer "expelled", he is attending classes with those classmates he was intending to kill. fun fun]]
