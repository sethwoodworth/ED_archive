There, Their, and They're

Quite possibly the most difficult [[gay|homophone]] trio to master, their misuse is widespread on the [[internets]]. Most uneducated [[luser|users]] posting on [[forum]]s and [[YouTube]] not only have no idea when to use which one, but most can't even [[sic|spell]] them properly.  

== There ==
The least improperly utilized of the three, but when its use is required most use another form instead. '''There''' is in [[fact]] used when describing a location, when pointing out an object, or simply if you don't know which to use using this will least likely result in you getting [[pwned|mocked]].

Examples: 
*''There is [[you]]r tiny dick.''
*''There are several erect [[cock|penises]] up your [[asshole]].''
*''There goes your [[mom]] to the [[whore]]house again.''

== Their ==
Retardedly following the confusing and often contradicted rule of English grammar: "I before E except after C," which no one has yet learned in language class. The word '''their''' is in fact spelled '''T-H-E-I-R''', not actually involving a '''C'''. '''Their''' is used when declaring ownership, either yours or a that of a third party.

Examples:
*''Their dicks are tiny.''
*''Their erect penises are up your ass.''
*''Their mom sees your mom going to the whorehouse.''

== They're ==
Probably the most [[rape|abused]] of the three. '''They're''' is a contraction to be used wherever you could possibly use the words '''they are''' as a substitute. If you don't take the time to check this, you are either [[13-year-old boy|10 years old]] and under the incorrect impression that you are so [[stupid|clever]] because you know there are several forms of the word, a [[butthurt]] monkey, or simply lazy. Were you truly lazy you would only use '''there''' for everything.

Examples: 
*''They're making fun of your tiny dick.''
*''They're thrusting their penis in and out of your asshole.''
*''They're going to the whorehouse to get a piece of your mom.''
