'''''Infantry Craft II: [[Electric Boogaloo]]''''' is the next great [[Halo|overrated]] [[RTS]] that has the whole of the [[America|RTS community]] [[Blowjob|sucking]] each others [[cocks]] over. After waiting [[over 9000]] years for starcraft 2, blizzard delivered the [[starcraft|same fucking game]] with improved graphics. The game harbors no variety whatsoever except that all the units are infantry, which is one reason why only Chinks like the game anyways. In order to [[rape|beat]] other [[Basement Dweller|players]] [[Internets|online]] you simply click on the same unit [[over 9000]] times by the end of the round and usually you will [[win]]... if you are not a complete and utter MOTHER FUCKER. If you were [[gay]] [[Yes|enough]], you bought this game the day it came out to have [[Loser|epic infantry battles]]. If you have a [[No|brain]], [[lulz|you will torrent this game first, only to realize what utter shit and hyped up it was]]. Each  $60 copy of the game comes with 2 trial accounts to <s>[[you have no friends|give to your friends]]</s> use as [[griefing|troll]]/[[hax|hack]] accounts or to use to pwn some noobs with.

==Campaign==
Basically the campaign in Shitcraft 2 is [[Fact|the same as every other Blizzard game ever]]. You [[Orgy|team up with a bunch of guys]], some of them turn out to be [[Tom Cruise|psychopaths]], others turn out to be [[moot|traitors]], while still others end up as [[Juliana Wetmore|horrible monstrosities]]. Jim Raynor spends the entire game bawwing about his mutated girlfriend, spaced out with [[Shit|awesome]] battles against aliens and [[Hitler|fascists]]. The only good part in the campaign is when you get to [[lulz|genocide a whole alien planet]] because Raynor wanted his girlfriend back.

The Jews at Blizzard, being [[trolls|the clever lot that they are]] decided that not only are they not going to release it as a full game with three individual campaigns like the original.  But they're going to release each race's campaign separately at $60 a pop that you have to register online at Battlenet.  So for you cavemen out there who still don't have an internet connection consider yourself fucked. Also if you want to be able to play different saved games at once you better be prepared to sit for a few hours creating new Battlenet accounts.

==Differences from Starcraft 1 and why they now suck ass ==

{{quote|The SCV is no longer an intelligent, nerdy dark skinned guy, but now someone who faintly resembles a citizen of Alabama. Every time I selected the SCV, I took off my headphones, not wanting to hear the contrived comments it was programmed to say. To build an object was perhaps the most demeaning thing to do.

"Well butter my biscuit."

It is nothing short of insulting when you think of it. The SCV is no longer a goofy, but intelligent unit anymore, and is instead just a southerner put in for the sake of this game's theme.|jepsen1977|Some stupid faggot who misses the nigger SCVs in Starcraft1}}

==Characters of Interest==

===Terrans===
*'''Acturus Mengsk''': While in Starcraft 1 his intentions were driven by butthurt over having his family raped and murdered by ghosts, which eventually led him to use an entire zerg swarm to totally assfuck an entire planet named Tarsonis, along with going mad with power. In Starcraft 2, he's just a typical Stalin rip-off, who wants to kill Raynor like his life depended on it(Weeelll technically it does, his political life anyway). Raynor then trolls him by releasing his certain statement he made on Tarsonis that mentions the order to use the Zerg to attack Tarsonis to the public. It was inevitable for the [[Old Media]] to mercilessly troll him on live TV.

*'''Jim Raynor''': Jim used to be slightly awesome in SCI and in BW, eh [[doesn't afraid of anything|kills everything and doesn't afraid of anything]]. Jim is now just a two-dimensional drunk faggot made only to cater to 13 year old boys, flying around in a stolen battlecruiser named the "Hyperion". The script for this character is as horribly written as Halo fanfiction.

*'''Tycus Findlay''': Ex-convict and Jim's old friend. Without going into a fuckheug amount of detail, his personality is an avatar of what [[Internet tough guy]]s want to be: badass and doesn't give a fuck about other people's shit. If you haven't read the spoiler on the top he's actually working for Mengsk to kill Kerrigan and then Raynor [[owned|puts a bullet through his head]] [[fail|after he misses a shot from his gauss rifle at  point - fucking - blank range]].

*'''Nova Terra''': A female Dominion Ghost operative/the ultimate wet dream for every player who creams themselves over ghosts. Hey, someone had to do it. Also a [[Mary Sue]].

*'''Gabriel Tosh''': A rogue Dominion Specter/stereotype Rhasta. Had the hots for Nova during Ghost Academy but was cut short after realizing he'd rather be [[gay]].

*'''Ariel Hanson''': A doctor Jim rescues from some planet called Agria. She has 2 endings that are pretty much all bad; one is that she finds a new planet her colony can fuck over again with their Zerg [[AIDS]], the second is that she contracts said Zerg [[AIDS]] and tries to kill Jim, but gets shot in the head because we all know that wimminz can't do anything right these days, even in the future.

*'''Egon Stetmann''': The Hyperion's lab [[geek]]/stereotype geek. Rips off more sci-fi movie quotes than an actual geek.

*'''Ron Swann''': The Hyperion's technician/weapons whore. Gets a boner whenever new weapons are obtained.

===The Zerg===
*'''[[Mary Sue|Kerrigan]]''': In SCI Brood War, she was some hardcore psycho bitch who went on to obliterate anything in her path and inject some ominous amounts of [[Just as Planned]] at almost anything she does. But the [[twilight|clever writers]] at Blizzard decided to dumb down the script to appeal to [[13 year old boy|newer gamers]],the decided to make her human in the end even though Raynor in broodwar clearly said that he's going to be the one to kill her. It is possible that trough Jim's usual drinking session allowed him to forget how Kerrigan literally obliterated the entire UED fleet, betryaing and murdering his Protoss buttbuddy Fenix, her brood infesting Mar Sara and killing everyone, killing a fuckheug number of civilians......etc. She's basically to Antagonizer from fallout 3 with a better costume. 

===Protoss===
*'''Tassadar''': Somehow survives pwning the overmind by crashing his Carrier onto it (Worth nothing how the overmind is somewhat shaped like a [[vagina]] and the Carrier shaped like a vibrating egg.). Used only as a deus ex machina.

*'''Zeratul''': Hasn't really changed since the last game. Still as mysterious and emo as ever.

*'''Salendris''': THE first Protoss with tits (sort of) to appear in games, who rides around in a fuckheug Carrier, which does shit and isn't that surprising. Fulfills the [[sick fuck]] dreams of fanboys who does nothing but fap to aliens. 

==How to Win in Multiplayer==
Or if you feel like a complete douche bag, you can build an unrealistic [[W|nuclear missile and launch it at your enemies]], feeling like a complete [[badass]], but really <s>[[you|you're]] just some stupid [[azn]] [[16 year old girl|kid]] who [[Butthurt|wastes their time]] building fake [[Cock|ass missiles]] in an RTS game that [[Truth|doesn't do shit]]</s> I'm butthurt.

==Conventions==
There have been a lot of [[Orgy|conventions]] hosting that [[gay]], piece of [[shit]], garbage game known as FagCraft 2: Wings of [[Cock]], and [[You|nerds]] from all over the world spend [[At least 100]] dollars to see a five minute preview of that sad excuse of a game. When attending one of these gay cockfest conventions, you can find yourself surrounded by a bunch of [[You|40 year old]] [[virgins]]  and horny little Koreans that play [[Trap|dress up]] like it's fucking Halloween. [[Fact|You should avoid these gatherings at all costs]], because [[b|nerdy fat bitches]] that can't get [[sex|laid]] [[IRL|in the normal world]] are desperate to find "[[Sex|love]]" at the conventions and will have sex with as many nerds as [[OVER 9000|possible]] (if they actually have the balls to touch another [[woman]] besides their own [[Your Mom|mothers]]), meaning that they probably have [[AIDS]] [[In The Ass|in their ass]]. They probably like to do some [[Inception|weird, crazy ass shit]] like [[2 Girls 1 Cup]].

==YouTube==

Months before the release of Starcraft 2, [[Youtube]] was [[Zerg rush|Zerg rushed]] with waves of Starcraft 2 videos from the alpha and beta versions. This eventually gave way to the rise of many SC2 commentators on Youtube. Many SC2 commentators on youtube now clock [[over 9000]] to as many as 200,000 subscribers. Luckily Youtube is now reducing the videos on the front page much in the way they did when [[Modern Warfare 2]] was released.

After a [[azn|chink]] executive was fired from their offices in China, a video leaked out from one of Blizzard's cutscene production companies showing the end of Heart of the Swarm. The quality was decent enough for a demo, and the voices sounded close, but it could have been an elaborate [[trap|hoax]]; however as soon as copies were uploaded to YouTube, copyright claims by Activision took each one down within minutes. You can still see it [http://kotaku.com/5709838/ending-leaked-for-starcraft-iis-next-chapter here], so be sure to send it to every Starcraft [[virgin|fan]] that you know provided they lack the physical strength to do anything with their inevitable rage. In other words, all of them.


==Amazon.com==
Ever since the release of the $60 expansion pack Wings of Liberty. Amazon.com has been flooded with negative reviews filled with delicious fanboy tears about how their beloved franchise has been tainted with the cutting of certain features from the original Battlenet service such as:
*Private channel support
*Private game features missing
*Named custom games
*Regional server options

Among the other complaints were the price tag, the registrations and the painfully long installation time resulting in a great many lulz.

===Battle.net 2.0===
Massive butthurt was experienced by the [[basement dweller|community]] over [[Web 2.0|battle.net 2.0]] which removed useless features like [[LAN Party|LAN]] and [[Chat|chatrooms]].
New features in battlenet 2.0 include...

*[[Xbox live|A new matchmaking system]]
*[[Facebook]] integration.
*Maps in the server browser will be arranged according to it's [[faggotry|popularity]]
*It also looks like the fucking windows interface with it's tabs and shit.

Removed features include..
*Passworded games  
*Chatrooms <--In SC1,these were only used for [[pedo baiting]],[[spam]],and [[hacker|hacks]] anyway,so it's [[fact|good]] that these are now gone.
*Game titles <--Game titles are for faggots who want ''NO RUSH 30 MINUTE'' games.

==Trolling Starcraft2 fanboys==
The easiest way to troll Starcraft 2 fags is to imply that Starcraft 2 is just Starcraft 1 with better graphics.
This works best if you use outadated information/screenshot from 2008.
Like butthurt atheists or christfags,they will endlessly try to prove you wrong [[arguing on the internet|on the internet]].
The many ways to troll include....

*Tell them Blizzard [[Modern Warfare 2|spent more money on advertising than on the actual game]].
*Post on the forums that the game needs [[Warcraft 3|heroes and items]].
*Say [[WWII|Company of Heroes]]/[[Supreme Commander]] is better.
*Say Blizzard is splitting the game into 3 games that will cost $50 each.
*[[spoiler|Spoil]] the ending (Raynor dies)(Actually, Kerrigan turns human, Tychus was working for mensgk, Raynor kills Tychus)
*Tell them [[pro|microing]] is complete bullshit. (don't call it micromanagement,this is to piss them off)
*Whine on the forums to get "rushers" and people who "build assimilators on your vespine" banned.
*Refer to Starcraft as a "clickfest" or "clicking competition" devoid of any strategy.
*Saw "Oh wow blizzard spent $100 million dollars just to add better [[crysis|graphics]],*facepalm*".
*Say "it's the [[Electric Boogaloo|same damn game]]" OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
*Refer to Starcraft 2 as Starcraft 1.5
*Say it's impossible to play online without being pwnt by a [[korea|korean]] player.
*Say protoss is [[bullshit|OP]].
*Say Starcraft 2 is a ripoff of [[Warhammer 40,000|Warhammer 40k]]. (Technically it is, Blizzard is still too lazy to be imaginative)
*Refer to the trailers as [[cliche|cliche'd]] and as shallow as a [[Michael Bay]] film.
*Say that being Korean makes you impossible to beat, and if you are Korean, endlessly rant how pro you are.
*Ask them what happened to Samir Duran.
*[[lie|Make shit up]],claim it requires a monthly subscription to play or cant be played offline,even in single player mode.
*Advertise the newest maphack, placement match hack,or drophack on youtube. This makes them rage the most.

Do not make it sound like you've done ANY research on Starcraft 2. Make as many baseless claims as you can!

===Marine Marauder Medivac===
[[File:MMM.jpg|thumb|Expect to see this very often.]]


'''MM''' is a '''Cheese''' in which the a Terran player attacks another player very early with one or two Marauders and two or three marines. 

'''MMM''' is a '''Strategy''' used if the MM did lot lead to an early victory. The Terran player will then mass Marines, Marauders and two to four Medivacs and then attack.



'''[((Cheese(Strategy)) / (Skill + Effort)]*100 = Winning Chance'''

The Numerator stands for the player using a certain '''Cheese''' and '''Strategy'''. 

The Denominator stands for the '''Skill''' and '''Effort''' put in by the opposing player.


When coming up with theories for strategies, players always assume both players are of equal skill.

According to the Starcraft formula for Winning Chance, the '''MMM''' will always win.

[((10(10)) / ((50 + 50)]*100  =  [(100) / (100)]*100  =  [1]*100 = 100%


Strategist have been working around the clock in order to find a strategy that can [cure|counter] the MMM when both players are of equal skill. Sadly they have yet to be found. 

Here are some examples on how these meetings usually occur.

'''Strategist 1:''' I will make Banelings and sneak attack them.

'''Strategist 2:''' But then you get MM.


'''Strategist 1:''' I will block my ramp with Sentries until I can build Colossus.

'''Strategist 2:''' But then you get MM.


'''Strategist 1:''' I won't be late for work if I skip breakfast.

'''Strategist 2:''' But then you get MM.

===Terran Units in Starcraft 2===
[[File:Ultraliskthor34.jpg|thumb|Thors [[rule 34|literally]] get assfucked by Ultralisks.]]
Terrans in starcraft 2 (unlike in Starcraft 1) are regarded as the most OP race ever,mostly due to the use off mules even though it can easily be cancelled out by forcing the player to use the scan ability. 

* [[Alabama|SCV]] - The black pilots with the southern drawl have been replaced by middleaged [[white trash|white]] [[poor|janitors]] this time around. SCVs yell [http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/801781931 "They took my job!"] when you drop in mules.
* [[Marines|Marine]] - Similar to starcraft 1,rather than upgrading it's range like in SC1,you can add 15 hp to it.
* [[rape|Reaper]] - Douchebags with jetpacks and uzis. Can quickly destroy just about any building in the early game. Useless later on,except against noobs.
* [[Bubba|Marauder]] - Nigras armed with RPGs and steel plated armor. This is what most Protoss noobs bitch about. Build as many of these as you can.
* [[sniper|Ghost]] - Can be used to launch a useless nuclear missle at the enemy. (press SPACEBAR to find location of cloaked ghost) Most hated by Protoss players for it's emp ability (even though the old emp removed ALL  shields)
* [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|Hellion]] -Hicks in recon buggies. SC1 pros constantly bitch about the removal of spider mines.
* [[Killdozer|Siege Tank]] - The only reason to be terran. Remember,units that can't see up cliffs cant shoot up cliffs.
* [[The Governator|Thor]] - An overpriced goliath with a novelty Schwarzenegger impression that gets old really fucking fast. You can piss people off if you build nothing but thors and have all your scvs auto-repair them.
* [[Transformers|Viking]]-The ONLY useful AA unit in the terran arsenal. Be sure to build a fuckton of these otherwise you'll lose the game.
* [[Dongcopter|Banshee]] - Unlike the wraith in Starcraft 1, this aircraft isn't complete shit against ground units. Use these to destroy expansions. 
* [[Engineer|Raven]] - A completely useless flying terran robot that detects shit but moves slow as fuck. Erects <s>sentries</s> turrets. Unit portrait is a [[4chan|secluded futuristic basement dweller]].
* Battlecruiser - Unlike in Starcraft 1,you cant kite with this shit anymore. <del>It also says stupid shit like [[trap|"IT'S A TRAP"]].</del> You can't hear shit from these units.
* Medivac- Women weren't meant for the battlefield, so they put them in planes made out of paper-mache and ass. Just build these with a fuckton of maruaders and marines to win. 

Campaign only units - Blizzard decided like the Jews that they are that some units are too OP and gay to be put in multiplayer.

* Firebat - Burns everything that is within two centimeters of the unit, most Firebats are known to be criminals but were released like OJ and forced in the military.
* Stripper - Medic - Blizzard decided that the only way to make medivacs more useless than a zergling was to create a ground medic that could barely heal a unit more than .01 health a minute.
*Diamondback - A vehicle that has twin-railguns and designed for hit-and-run tactics because it's the [[lolwut|ONLY unit in the entire universe that can shoot back while it's moving]]. This would be good if it wasn't for the fact that it has paper-mache armor and it moves like a god damn heavy tank, making it's abilities redundant.

Everything mentioned and not mentioned is shit and the unmentioned is shittier and/or not worth mentioning.

===Protoss units in Starcraft 2===
[[File:Void ray l2p.jpg|thumb|Guaranteed to assfuck an entire base all on it's own.]]
You will win all the time as Protoss if you don't have a brain hemorrhage and/or something impaling your asshole that jabs at your spinal cord. Also, this seems to be the only race you play as when you choose Random.

To win as protoss simply do the following..
#Build a gateway
#Build a fuckton of probes
#Build a cybernetics core,research warp gates
#Build a fuckton of gateways (at least 7),upgrade all of them into warpgates.
#Either build a pylon behind enemy lines,or deploy a warp prism in their base.
#Use the warp gates to Spam the [[fuck]] out of the army with instantly built units.

Alternatively, if you want it the hard yet still lulzy way:
#Keep building the things you need until a Stargate is unlocked.
#Build around 2-4 Stargates
#Build only Void Rays.
#Build moar
#Moar I say.
#If you have atleast 20 of them, you're almost there. Stop when you've at least obtained double, or if possible, triple that amount.
#Add a couple of Phoenix fighters to truly troll anti-air units, Carriers to screw around with the air defenses, or Observers to annoy cloaked anti-airs, if you can spare the resources and Psi anyway. 
#If you still have your cybernetics core, upgrade air weapons to Tier 3. Screw the armor mods, you won't need it.
#Send the entire fleet of rays towards your target's base and watch him devote truly retarded amounts of firepower to kill your rape force. For laughs, have probes build Photon cannons at the location where you're attacking, it's bound to cause even more rage since now, he's fucked on two fronts.

* [[Troll|Probe]] - The ultimate troll-unit. Use these to build assimilators and cannons in the other guy's base just to fuck with him and ass up his resource economy.
* Zealot - Same boring rush unit for the same boring players except it can now be upgraded with a new commando pro ability.
* Stalker - This is the exact same thing as the cryptfiend from Warcraft 3. However, these units are full-on ass.
* [[Ninja|Dark Templar]] - Same as the original one,use these to cum on your enemies from the shadows and surprise buttsecks their economy, since no one buys chastity belts anymore. They spread fascist subliminal messages saying that beer is a illusion.
* [[spam|Void Ray]] - Guaranteed [[win]] as a Protoss player if you focus all resources on spamming this shit. The most fucking OP unit ever. Basically, the ray's [[lazor]] continues to rack up in damage as it continues to focus on whatever it's attacking, so basically, if your opponent can't stop it in 4 seconds or less, anything that they're giving a mean look is raped beyond hope. Attacks are also artillery range, so even static anti-air defenses can't touch it. Now the only thing that could have possibly had a chance of stopping void rays without committing a ridiculous amount of forces were the shitty Terran Wraiths, who could cloak and annoy would the fuck out of the entire attack force, but Blizzard saw this, and so restricted the Wraith to Single-player.
* High Templar - One of the best protoss units nobody ever uses. Should be used to shoop-da-whoop enemy units,but it fails horribly. 
* [[electric boogaloo|Archon]] - What happens when one templar has surprise buttsecks with another.Unlike the original,this one can be formed by interracial sex also.Should be used as a back-up in case you fail with templars (100% chance),but it fails even more.
* [[Dick neck|Colossus]] - Design [[tracing|stolen]] from war of the worlds. It's so fucking tall that it can be shot by AA units. Use it to assfuck Zerg players since it fires twin AoE [[lazor]] beams that [[Kill it with fire|fries anyone killed by it]].
* Immortal - A dragoon on steriods with a hard ass fucking shield and cannons that eats anything expensive and large for lunch. [[lolwut|Cannot attack air units, despite the fact that the pilot can aim his cannons into the air]].
* Phoenix -  A corsair that can spin. Use it's gravity beam ability to life off scvs and troll terrans.
* Carrier - A giant gold egg that shits kamikaze pilots. Completely useless considering the void ray does twice as much damage AND is a bit cheaper. It only exists to confuse the fuck out of AA units that aren't microed.
* Warp Prism -When combined with 7 warp gates,you can instantly spam the fuck out of an enemy with zealots,stalkers,and dark templar.
* Photon Cannon - If you really suck at this game, just layer your base with thousands of these.
* Pylons - You must always construct additional pylons, regardless of the situation.

Everything else is shit and/or not worth mentioning.

===Zerg units in starcraft 2===
[[File:Zerg cake.jpg|thumb|Beating a Zerg player as Terran is as easy as eating this [[delicious cake|cake]].]]
Unlike in Starcraft 1 where the zerg were nigh unstoppable,the Zerg in StarCraft2 play like complete shit on 80% of the maps. You must also spawn larva every 40 seconds in order to not fail. Everything is living and is practically cheap and disposable, like [[Mexico|Mexicans]]. Note that the only attack units you will really need is the Zergling, Baneling, Roach, Mutalisk, and to a lesser extent: the Broodlord; picking other ones means you will automatically loose.

* Drone - The same zerg bug that you can sacrifice to have it grow into a tentacle dildo.
* Zergling - The only way one could possibly rush. The other races can't create shit by the time you have 6 zerglings.
** Baneling - An American-Arabian evolution of the Zergling. Basically, these zerglings evolved into an [[obese]] fuck that can't attack anyone anymore with claws but instead sprays corrosive acid to anyone nearby when it detonates, like a suicide bomber.
* [[Roach]] - Shit units, can only attack ground units despite [[lol_wut|having ranged attacks]]. Butthurt from the enemy ensues when you have them burrow. Also, for some reason it really annoys people when you rush with exactly 7 of them within the first 5 minutes or so.
* Hydralisk - They are only ass if you have [[at_least_100|less than 100]]. Would be useful if they were cheaper and their attacks did shit.
* Ultralisk - Shit. Sure it's tough as fuck but it's so fucking slow that it gets murdered by massed units and also fuckhueg expensive. Use these to lose or if you really hate yourself and your time.
* Mutalisks - God-tier, spam for ultimate aerial assfuck. Sending over a Zergling-Mutalisk spam attack force will cause hilarity of a grand scale.
* Queen - [[woman|You keep them in the base to make babies]].
* Infestor - Another addition to the zerg trolling arsenel. Sneak them into the enemy's base and spawn an entire platoon of infested marines, who contracted Zerg AIDS. Alternatively, play against a protoss who has no idea how to play, use Neural Parasite on one of his probes, build an entirely protoss-zerg army, and use it to win. Bonus points if he calls you hacker and demands to know "HOW YUO GET ALL THE CLASSeS".
* Overlord - SPAWN MOAR OVERLOARDS.
** Overseer - An evolution of the Overlord that grants detection, because it's just not fair for anyone to have 20 or so, roving detectors which don't take up control resource. The thing's avatar looks like a vagina.
* Broodlords - Rains endless butthurt on ground units, is as useless as a bar of soap against anything in the air. Additional trolling for the lulzy Muta-Zergling rush force.

Everything else is shit and/or not worth mentioning.

==[[StarCraft II|Starcraft 2]] Tourneyfags==
As with [[Super Smash Bros|Super Smash Brothers Brawl]], there is a faction of SC2 fans that believes competitive gaming is more important than game quality. These people are mostly [[wapanese]] who [[masturbate]] to vods of their favorite pro-gamer. To them, the privilege of having to click every production building to create a single unit is as imperative to Starcraft 2's success as wave-dashing is to brawl's.  Basically, being able to select multiple buildings (MBS) to create multiple units at the same time will ruin Starcraft 2.

Two great sites for trolling sc2 tourneyfags are [[Battle.net Forums|the official battle.net forums]] and the ultimate source for circle-jerking to professional Korean ''Starcraft'' gamers:  [http://www.teamliquid.net The one-stop source for all things E-SPORTS]

Trolling is simple. Simply make a thread saying that MBS and auto mining will make ''Starcraft 2'' more competitive. Then watch as how dozens of raging nerdgins (the formal term for a nerd who is also a virgin) tear the post apart, discussing the mechanics of human-eye coordination and bringing up quotes of professional gamers playing a pre-alpha build of ''Starcraft 2''.

==Starcraft 2 Is Serious Business==


{{morphquote||Managers of esports are worried about SC2.  Korea is the main market of SC2. If it will succeed there, it will succeed everywhere else. If it will fail there, so it will fail around the world.|This is how damaging being able to select multiple buildings at once .|
Real sports are for freaks. |Prometheus4096 making fun of a bunch of fat WoW nerds that dared to question his athletic ability since he is much more competitive as a triathlete then as a Starcraft player.
|Some people here hate esports. They are shown to be retarded and backward dinosaurs from the '70s. |Incorrectly attributed to the apparently famous Prometheus4096.
|And that's why you people shouldn't be allowed to post here in the first place. You laugh at the heart and soul of SC. |Prometheus4096's reaction to someone saying it is ok that you only need 1.8 scvs to mine optimally instead of 2.5 
|Same with Thor and Mothership; superunits to appeal to the masses; the shallow casual gamer from the MTV & McDonalds generation. |Prometheus4096, who also thinks using 'faggot' as an insult [[Captain Obvious|is a clear sign of homophobia]].
|The protoss music should outshine Beethoven's 9th at it's strong points.

Otherwise, I will be terribly disappointed| Jesus Fucking Christ.
|Im a nerd because I prefer sports over silly video games?| Prometheus on why he likes ''Starcraft'' but not WoW.
|IMO, every little micro counts as an advantage to the skilled player. If they continue to newb up SC2 it probably won't even be worth it. If worker units split automatically when going to a mineral patch, there will be nothing left in the game to control. |Some uncreative encyclopediadramatica-user trying desperately to make fun of Prometheus4096.}}
