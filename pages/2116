Having a '''dead friend''' is a common [[bullshit|excuse]] that [[emos]] give so they can justify having a [[Mitchell Henderson|bad day]]. Apparently, it's a rite of passage for such [[fags|emos]], and if you have a [[dead]] friend that [[bullshit|automatically means your life completely sucks]].  The best way to express how much your life [[shit nobody cares about|suxx0rs]] because of your dead friend is to bring up their death in every conversation, or you could just [[an hero|kill yourself]] and join your friend, but that's only for the [[Ripper|really XxhardcorexX]].  To compensate for not having billboards to advertise their problems, [[emos]] often fill up their [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], [[Live Journal]], [[Gaia|GaiaOnline]] or [[dA]] profiles/pages bragging about their dead friends. You can see pictures, artworks even links to articles about their dead friend. Not just talking about their friend but making a [[profit]] out of it, because it increase people visiting you, coming by to say : "sorry", "I am so sorry" or any other emo fake emotion comment people can copy/paste or write.  If you happen across one of these please, feel free to leave a lulz filled comment.

==Trolling the Dead==
[[image:Westboro.jpg|thumb|[[Fred Phelps]] and his [[ICP|posse]] are renown [[trolling|trollers]] of people with dead friends.]]

[[Trolling]] people with [[emo|dead friends]] is easier than taking [[Mitchell Henderson]]'s ipod. For the greatest example of a dead friend troller, look to the infamous [[Fred Phelps]] of the Westboro Baptist Church. This prolific [[fag|closet]] case has dedicated his life to picketing the funerals of dead [[homo]]s and soldiers (same thing).

Some excellent ways to [[troll]] people with dead friends include:
*[[photomanip]] pics of the worm food with [[Goatse]], [[tubgirl]], roadkill, or a [[Mortal Kombat|fatality]]; preferably with the phrase "[[pwned]]" or "fatality" on the pic.
*Say you [[shit|pissed]] on their grave, preferably with [[photoshop|pics]] to prove it.
*Be creative, [[emos|people with dead friends]] are among the most easily [[butthurt]] people [[evar|EVAR!!]], second only to [[scientologists]], even a [[n00b]] can [[pwn]] them.

==How to make a profit off a dead friend==
*Add picture and name of the dead person, write some emo crap and wait for the millions of comments.
*With a dead friend you can act like a jerk and get away with it!
*To make money profit add PayPal link, say itÂ´s for a fund or going to the [[lies|family]].
*Make memorial website.
*[[???]]
*PROFIT!
*Buy condoms and fuck your girlfriend (which is possible to obtain because you aren't an [[emo]])
