''greentips'' ethnicity is sometimes a point of contention on the forum as he is likely the only Chinese user there, the vast majority being white closet-racists. Occasionally, some of the closet-racists will reveal their feelings and this results in ''greentips'' banning [[over 9000]] of them to [http://www.canadiangunnutz.com/forum/showthread.php?p=3507762#post3507762 look tough.]
