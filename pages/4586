'''Killer''', a suffix used mostly by douchebag [[technophile]]s and [[bloggers]], is usually used to describe electronics and how they are going to "kill" the competition. This more than 92% of the time turns out to be the shittiest product with the largest hype imaginable. This means that the suffix "killer" is synonymous with [[crap]].

[[Web_1.0|Back in the day]], '''killer''' was also used to describe [[apps]]. As in: '''"''Dude, [[Telnet]] is a killer app.'''''" 

==Examples==

*The '''[http://www.verizonvoyager.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/lg-voyager-titanium-1.jpg LG Voyager]''', a dumbphone that only runs on BREW (The poor man's JAVA) was dubbed the ''[[iPhone-killer]]'' before it's release, however it turned out to be the biggest piece of shit phone since the [[iPhone]] itself (Meaning that it was such a POS that it made the iPhone look good.). With no storage, [[Seamonkey|a terrible browser]], no multitouch screen and most importantly no [[App Store]], Verizon really [[bestiality|screwed the pooch]] on that one. 

*'''[http://www.google.com/buzz Google Buzz]''' was the [[almost raped|supposed]] [[Twitter]]-killer, [http://searchengineland.com/google-with-buzz-we-failed-to-appreciate-that-users-have-different-privacy-expectations-36522 and we all know how well that turned out].

*Any '''[[MMORPG]]''' that's hyped up to topple ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. For example, ''[[Aion]]'', once hailed as the greatest, most innovative MMO of all-time, [http://www.massively.com/2010/06/23/server-merge-hints-are-confirmed-for-aion/ had 31 servers merge into 13] 10 months after release. ''Star Trek Online'' is another example, especially when someone tried to make an [[EQ2Flames]] ripoff and call it [[STOFlames]]. Guess what happened.

*'''[[Facebook]]''' was supposed to be the ''MySpace killer'', oh wait, guess they are in the 8%. [[MySpace]] sucks.

*[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=11268546 BlackBerry 9800] set to be unveiled [[last Thursday|next Tuesday]] will destroy the iPhone. No one is sure how yet. [[Unrealistic expectations|But it just will]]. [[Disregard|Nevermind]] the fact that itâ€™s [[at least 100|at least the tenth]] or so phone to earn such a moniker.
