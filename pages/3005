Foamy the Squirrel

'''Foamy''' is a [[shitty art|cartoon squirrel]] and the main character of the ''[http://www.illwillpress.com/ Neurotically Yours]'' series of [[at least 100]] [[Flash]] cartoons that [[jumped the shark]] somewhere around the second or third episode. The cartoons are drawn and voiced by some guy named Jonathan ''(aka IllWillPress)'', who uses them as an outlet for his [[Tourette's Guy|Tourette's-addled]] rants. 

IllWill also used to draw a [[shit]]ty [[webcomic]] called [http://www.lollipop.com/cgi-bin/gallery/gallery.cgi?direct=Comic_Gallery/Jonathan_Ian_Mathers 4-Y records] which essentially consisted of him prattling on pretentiously for four of the exact same frame about some of his favourite shit bands and why they're awesome. He eventually stopped updating this after it became apparent that [[Nobody gives a shit|nobody gave a shit]] about his horrendous taste in [[music]]. Jonathan "[[John Kricfalusi|Prick-falusi]]" Mathers also has no taste in Ren and Stimpy because of his animations.

==Other characters==
The cartoon started out with [[retard|Foamy]] and his owner [[whore|Germaine]], but as time went on, IllWill realised that his [[fan]]base would eventually get tired of him recycling the exact same cartoon every few weeks with a new voiceover. To remedy this, he created a bunch of other equally bland characters and peddled them out whenever he'd run short on good ideas.

===Germaine===
Supposedly [[hot]] [[goth]]/[[wiccan]] chick who [[beastiality|owns]] Foamy. [[Contrary to popular belief]], nobody actually wants to see Germaine naked except for IllWill, who [[fap]]s nightly to naked drawings of his creation ''(See [[Fred Gallagher]])''. Aside from masturbation fodder, this also serves as a way to fill up some more tragically unfunny episodes of his [[shit]] cartoon by [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/218238 making her boobs inflate for no readily apparent reason].
IllWill seems to think that by putting [[attention whore|Germaine]] in nothing but underwear for most of the episodes that he'll get more views, however in reality, its only himself who still watches the show. A recent episode shows Germaine getting hit by a big load of cum, which goes to show what IllWill's [[obvious|fantasies are of Germaine.]]

===Pilz-E===
Pill-popping, [[batshit insane]] squirrel, because Foamy wasn't quite crazy enough for the [[Invader Zim]]-loving [[16-year-old girl|16-year-old]] [[Goth|mallgoths]] who make up NY's fans.

===Tha Hatta===
Token stereotype black person squirrel. Modeled after the Mad Hatter boss from [[American]] McGee's [[Emo|Alice]]. Loves fried chicken, watermelons, grillz, and pimped out Daewoos.

===That stalker dude===
He stalks Germaine. That is the extent of his character. IllWillPress based this character on himself.
