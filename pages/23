[[Image:Newneverchange.png|thumb|/new/ as it was]]

'''/n/''' is [[4chan]]'s transportation image board entirely devoted to discussion of [[hipster]] "fixie" [[bike]]s. /n/ used to be for news, but that got moved over to '''/new/''' for reasons explained below.

=A brief history of /n/=
[[Image:EndofN.jpg|thumb|The last straw]]
Previously /n/ - Trains and /n/ - Nature (which went on to become /an/ - Animals & Nature), it became /n/ - News and stayed as such for quite some time.

/n/ - News on [[4chan]] was [[some argue|universally considered]] a bastion of [[racist|rational debate]] and [[troll|witty banter]]. One day, however, [[moot]] decided to [[banned|b&]] the whole board because they said mean things about [[Barack Hussein Obama]] and There are no black people on the Internets. <s>Naturally, conspiracy burst forth from the death of /n/, with reasons varying from the incompatibility of 4chan's modernization to the fact that it was a bitch to moderate. [[Some argue]] that the real reason behind /n/'s closure was that moot didn't want to attract any media attention during the election year.</s> And nothing of value was lost.

/n/ subsequently became /n/ - Trains once more, turning into /n/ - Transportation shortly after when [[/fa/]]'s hipster [[faggot|/fa/ggot]]s invaded with their fixed gear bikes, took it over, and ran the railfans out of town to [[1chan]].

==The exodus and /new/==
With the recent demise of /n/ - News, many of its denizens have taken up posting their news stories on [[/k/]]. These stories are usually about [[China]] and are always saged and reported, but the /n/ewsfags are persistent and as a result there is always at least one /n/ews thread on page 1. If there is a cancer that is killing /k/, this is it.

But news soon returned to 4chan. /new/ - News, restored to /n/'s former glory. While perhaps not the worst board on 4chan, /new/ is very close. It's certainly the most [[racist]], surpassing /k/ and even /int/ in that regard. Actual news stories are a rare sight on /new/. The board is mostly threads about the [[Nazis]] and [[Holocaust]]-denial, the relative intelligence levels and penis sizes of the various races, interracial [[pr0n]], [[Conspiracy Theory|assorted conspiracy theories]], and, above all else, the Jew. The contributors of /new/ consist almost entirely of trolls, with the odd genuinely psychotic Confederate holdout thrown in. All things considered, /new/ is the best place to go on 4chan if you're looking for horrifying political debate.

<s>The only reason moot has betrayed his promise and hasn't deleted /new/ yet is because it keeps the neo-Nazis off of /k/ and /int/ and also serves as a nice honeypot for rightwing extremists that's easy for moot's colleagues in the [[FBI]] to monitor.</s> /new/ was [[Trollface|deleted on Martin Luther King Day]]. 
==The Death of /new/==
[[Image:Twitterreactiontonewdeletion.jpg|thumb|There was much weeping and lamentation.]]
On January 17th of the Year of Our Lord 2011, 4chan deleted /new/ and began banning anyone who posted anything /new/-related on the other boards. No reason was given for this holocaust. This date just happened to be Martin Luther King, Jr. day, proving that moot is indeed a niggerlover. In response, [http://4chon.org/new/ 4chon] made a /new/ several hours later, while yet another [http://4chon.net/new/ site] decided to make one several hours after the first one did (think [[clusterfuck]]).

==Trolls and memes of /n/ - News==
[[Image:ISM.gif|thumb|Invisible Sky Magician]]
'''Invisible Sky Magician'''

An infamous anti-religion troll whose usually offensive rants have gotten him banned repeatedly. Unfortunately he always posts using a proxy, so it's impossible to get rid of him permanently. ISM has expanded his name to include cross symbols and a URL to his blog, presumably just to be even more obnoxious, and admits to having at least 8 different personas that he uses to troll. Any post he makes tends to get heavily saged, but that just encourages him to troll harder. Is also known for trolling /jp/ by spamming with racist rants that even the actual racist members got annoyed by him.

'''PROUD CONSERVATIVE'''

Not really a namefag, tripfag, or emailfag, but an Anonymous who used to end his posts with "--PROUD CONSERVATIVE". PROUD CONSERVATIVE first appeared on August 23, 2006, when /b/ and many of the other boards were down, and several /b/tards flooded /n/ (one of the only boards that was still up) with troll posts. Whether he was part of the /b/tard invasion is unknown, but he was definitely a troll. PROUD CONSERVATIVE was noticeable mostly for expressing slightly over the top arguments in favor of conservative politics and making nonsensical insults against liberals such as "moonbat". Replies by others using his signature soon followed, from the classic "DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS" to slightly more subtle mockery. This became what was probably /n/'s first meme, and there are still occasions of knock-offs (such as "PROUD CONSERVATARD") used to insult conservative posters.

'''not news, needs pruning'''

A common response in /n/ to posts that either contain no actual news story, or contain one that's considered less than newsworthy. Typically includes a "[[sage]]".

=Tripfags of /new/=

'''Flowergirl'''

Flowergirl is a semi-legendary (and [[No girls on the internet|female]]!) [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] tripfag from the early days of /new/. She got severely [[Docs|dox]]ed by anon, then left 4chan forever. Only one photograph of her is known to exist, in which she looks vaguely fuckable, in a freckled, mannish sort of way. She is widely known for her steadfast insistence that [[Retard|the ocean should be privatized]].

'''Progressive Right Wing Nationalist'''

[[Some argue]] that Progressive Right Wing Nationalist was the single greatest tripfag /new/ has ever seen. PRWN was an Irish lad with vague fascist sympathies who constantly posted pictures of Sir Oswald Mosely and the British Union of Fascists. Although he was careful to distance himself from the neo-Nazism rampant on /new/, he gradually came to accept that niggers are biologically inferior to white people (even though he himself is Irish--not exactly the top of the racial totem pole). PRWN later converted to neoplatonism (did not see that one coming) and drastically cut back on his posting. Some suspect that his conversion was just the government's cover for him getting v&. Others think that he was an FBI informant all along, and the conversion was merely cover for his reassignment to either /k/ or, more likely, [[Stormfront]] itself.

'''Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam'''

Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam (AMDG for short) is absolutely fucking infamous. Just the mention of his name is enough to throw most [[Atheist|godless]] /new/ites into a spiral of bitter, slathering rage. The consummate [[Christian|Christfag]], AMDG posts on /new/ night and day, converting heathens unto the Lord and defending the faith against the slanders of the atheist hordes who even now besiege Christendom. A walking Bible, AMDG uses images of the Knights Templar as his avatar. This scares the shit out the local dune coon population, especially VOV.

'''Jewish National Socialist'''

/new/ is home to a genuine Jewish National Socialist. No troll. This guy is legit. He doesn't deny the [[Holocaust]] at all, but rather sees it as the stern discipline of the loving father figure of the Fuhrer. JewNazi wants to apply the teachings of Adolf Hitler and the model of the Third Reich to the Jewish people and the State of Israel. He'd also like to apply the lessons of the Holocaust to the [[Palestinian]]s, so he can't be all bad.

This meme (a.k.a. Why /new/ Is So Racist or simply Niggerwalk) is the only good thing that has ever come out of /new/. It's based on the first part of this four-part comic.
