Common knowledge

Some things you just know, you know? It is common knowledge that gravity exists. It is common knowledge that [[smoking]] makes you thin. It is common knowledge that Wilford Brimley has [[diabeetus]]. And it's common knowledge that Dr. Ivo Robotnik has a [[Pingas]].

Common knowledge (or common sense) is known by absolutely everybody with a brain. Some people, who are severely lacking in intellect and probably dribble on their [[keyboard]], do not know The Obvious. This leads to many, many [[lulz]], especially when they: a) declare to the world something which proves that they are ignorant of The Obvious, or b) declare to the world that they have just discovered something that everybody knew to be Obvious already. Sometimes drama results from people believing anything they know to be common knowledge by default, resulting in their [[flame|flaming]] others for daring not to know some obscure [[fact]]. [[Lulz]] ensue shortly afterwords when everyone else flames them into the dirt for being the pedantic little shits they are.

The problem is that most people on [[LJ]] (and the [[internets]] in general) lack common sense.  This usually means [[drama]] for those without it, and [[lulz]] for those gifted with it.

If you are new to [[LJ Drama]], there are certain things that are '''common knowledge''' here that you might not be wise to.

==A History of Common Sense==

Common sense began [[over 9000]] years ago, when the caveman kept touching the fire and the [[dinosaurs]] told them to stop, because common sense for dinosaurs meant that fire burned and caused extinction.

Common sense then disappeared for [[at least 100 years]].  This is what was called the "Dark Ages."  When common sense returned, [[Europe]] called it "The Plague" and promptly ignored it for another hundred years, because, as displayed during the [[Holocaust]] ignoring the obvious is what Europeans do [[best]].

Common sense reared its ugly head in the [[United States]] prior to their independence, when Thomas Paine went [[Zerg Rush]] on the [[England|British oppressors]].  Ironically, in a surprise instance of common sense for them, [[France]] came to the aid of the colonies.  Common sense has not been observed in France since then.

Today, common sense is an endangered species.  Most of it went away when [[Al Gore]] created the [[internets]], allowing for those who were normally too [[stupid]] to speak to gain a voice.

==When Common Sense Doesn't Prevail==

[[Common Sense]] tells us to not post things on the [[internets]] that we don't want other people to see.  Thus, when everyone begins knowing that [[Ohbutyouwillpet]] is a [[sick fuck]], that [[mediacrat]] is a [[homosexual]], that [[Ratherberucking]] is a needy [[bitch]], or that [[Quasidan's penis|Quasidan has a huge cock]], it's because people without common sense probably told you.

Part of the reason [[ED]] and [[LJDrama]] are so popular is because there's no shortage of fun poking at the [[unfunny]] types with no common sense.
