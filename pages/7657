Solidarity is what you chant while looting an iPod in Union Square in the name of protesting the President or Israel.  It doesn't really matter as long as it's a 60gb. Fuck Nanos

You can signify your interest in participating in Solidarity by the following actions:

* Chanting "WHOSE STREETS?!?!" (correct answer: "SFPD!!!" (San Francisco Police Department))
* Chanting "[[JEWS DID WTC]]! [[Jews]] out of [[Israel]]!"
* Throwing a chair through a Starbucks.  ([[Black bloc]])
* Wearing all black. ([[Black bloc]])
* Blocking off traffic and screaming at yuppies who have already gotten ahold of their trust funds unlike yourself.
* Getting run over by a bulldozer. (see: [[Rachel Corrie]])

Other uses of solidarity are getting into the pants of impressionable 16-20 year olds who think your flophouse on 6th and Market is so fucking cool.

Don't forget.  60 gig iPod!
