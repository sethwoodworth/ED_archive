Internet Asshole
[[Image:John.jpg|thumb|Yeah, you do.]]
Internet assholes are people who make [[Internets]] suck for everyone. [[Spam|Spammers]], virus writers, [[Creepy Phil|child rapists]] and general bitches. Internets provide plenty of forums for outing Internet assholes. On some forums such as [http://www.slashdot.org Slashdot], [[real world]] [[Power Word: IRL Name|contact information]] is spread in forums about an Internet asshole, generally with the intent of harassment. 

[[LJ Abuse]], in order to limit "legal liability", always sides with Internet assholes when [[LiveJournal]] is the host of information. For example, just writing the ''name'' of a known Internet asshole in your LiveJournal is grounds for suspension. This prohibitive policy isn't in the [[LJ TOS]] but is in the [[secret policy document]]. Internet assholes prove the [[Internet Fuckwad Theory]] as truth.

It is interesting to note that the Internet Asshole's arch-nemesis is the [[Internet Tough Guy]], despite the fact that they share many of the same characteristics. The difference is that the IAs don't take themselves seriously. The ITGs do 110%.
