Coconut crabs are large land crabs that get their name from their ability to crack coconuts with their large claws, which is the same as being able to crack your skull open. So there's that. They are the largest land crabs in the world, and would fit snugly over your screaming face, if not your entire head. Seriously, they're large enough to occupy the entire space of your garbage can. They are nocturnal, which is good because they have poor eyesight, but bad because they will come for you in the night, slowly sensing the vibrations of your [[fap|lonely night-time activities]] and nearing your home, assuming you live near the Indian and Pacific oceans.

In some areas they are eaten as an [[secks|aphrodisiac]]. To what extent their aphrodisiac properties work depend on the individual. For example, some may get a rise by eating the crabs, some by having the crabs pinch them, and others by looking at naked pictures of them, like the ones on this page. Enjoy.

In [[Japan]], the crabs are sold as pets. Cages for the crabs must be strong enough so the crab doesn't escape, as one of its nicknames - the robber crab - reveals that it has a habit of stealing shiny things. Like knives.

We interviewed several people who had seen coconut crabs [online] and this is what they had to say:
