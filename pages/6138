POV
Pathogenic Oliovirus (POV) is a virus which specifically targets websites such as Wikipedia, which attempt to allow the communised dissemination of information while attempting to maintain a level of high quality. Being an impossible struggle between two sides of a political spectrum, POV can attack in the middle and bring down the whole thing.

==Symptoms of POV==
*[[Lunix]] advocacy even in the face of utter logical defeat.
*[[Microsoft]] bashing even in the face of utter logical defeat.
*[[Linux]] bashing even in the face of utter logical defeat.
*[[Microsoft]] advocacy even in the face of utter logical defeat.
*[[FreeBSD]] advocacy even in the face of utter indifference.
*Runny nose
*Hives
*[[Dick]] falling off
*Shingles
*[[Pringles]] 
*Esoteric internet In-jokes (such as the whole [[Chuck Norris]] buggery)
*Adoption of a lower standard of [[wiki]] editting.
*Not prefacing your opinion with a <nowiki>==</nowiki>[[Controversy]]<nowiki>==</nowiki> heading.


==POV In the Reality==
The POV virus [[Some_argue|is not hated by all]]. [[Lie|In fact]], all articles contain some sort of POV. So with that being said, personally I think Michael Bolton's music sucks. So does David Grohl, that fucking faggot.
