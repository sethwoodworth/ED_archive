==An Drama Is Born==

This [[drama]] has been going on since at least last Thursday, however, [[some argue]] that it could've been [[100 years ago|longer]].  The situation is essentially that of an [[almost raped|unrequited love]] by way of one C. Moulton vs. a [[whore|girl]] of the female variety going by the [[LJ]] handle of {{lj|PNaomi}}.  It should be noted at this point that his name is [[fact|actually]] a direct antonym of "[[Goatse|Self Respect]]"

Chuck is a chronically depressed [[basement dweller]] who at one point was living on a university campus whilst studying Law, and [[internet stalking]].  He is obsessed with [[fap|masturbation]], Tivo, PNaomi and chess.  Back then he was an [[cunt|aspiring political candidate]] for the [[Libertarian]]s no less.

Prior to Moulton achieving coveted [[lol-cow]] status on the ever burgeoning [[internets]], his LJ was open to [[13 year old|all comers]] wishing to [[troll|make commentary]] on Moulton's [[furry|depraved lifestyle]] choices and offer him various forms of E-Counseling ranging from logical, well-meaning discussion through to blatant trolling.  Most attempts at [[troll|reasonable discourse]] with Moulton normally fell on his deaf ears.  He was hell-bent on making himself a beacon for all cunt-struck males around the globe.

[[LJDrama]] brought these goings on to the forefront at some point and his legend grew somewhat.  As word circulated across message boards, so to did the sheer idiocy of the [[shit nobody cares about|situation as a whole]].

==Comings and Goings==

Amongst some of Moulton's more obtuse goings-on, he drove across country to bring {{lj|PNaomi}}some things after she had relocated ((With another man)), this was at considerable financial burden to himself, and was barely even [[sex|thanked]] for his time, effort and tenacity.

Chuck had expressed on more than one occasion a desire to quit his legal studies to acquire [[camwhore|full-time work]] in order to finance {{lj|PNaomi}} own schooling.  And typically of a situation involving such odd sentiment, {{lj|PNaomi}} was totally ambivalent to his over the top gesture(s).

==Depression==

As with most things that have a [[almost raped|romantic connotation]], depression became a staple in Moulton's life as he attempted to reconcile in his mind the reasons of PNaomi's out-right rejection of him, which, would normally give way to his mindless fantasies involving her in some lurid act.  Or whatever.

It should be noted at some point, Moulton was, and most likely still is a [[virgin]].  Despite his [[stupid|lack of knowledge]] in the [[rape|romance department]], Moulton unflinchingly held to his belief that PNaomi would be his through sheer bloody-minded perseverance.  No amount of [[troll|cajoling]], could dissuade him or convince him to approach the situation with a [[an hero|different perspective]].

So depressed was he, that at one point he attempted to become [[an hero]] which led to a brief tenure in hospital followed by extensive counseling by fully qualified staff.

==Everything in Moderation, or Whatever==

Moulton is reasonably active on [http://www.thebugboard.net/cgi-bin/messageboard/board-profile.cgi?action=view_profile&profile=knighttour-MODERATOR The Bug Board], which seems to be a self interest group primarily concerning themselves with Chess, and the playing thereof.  At one point he was banned from the Bughouse, and gave a fairly [[tl;dr]] post outlining his [[butthurt|concerns]] which can be found [http://www.thebugboard.net/messages/348/1165.html#POST12653 here], I do warn you, it is a very dry read, and is quite typical of this [[cunt|individual]].

==133t H4x0r skills...==

Chuck claims to have some sort of prowess involving hacking.  He also lists one of his favorite television serials as 'Hackers.' His actual handiwork, if any, isn't readily available, nor does he offer any suggestion regarding his level of expertise, or so-called 'hacking' attempts made.  Other ridiculous claims, and a friend in Ron Paul, can be found on his 'drier than the Sahara' [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=33364837 Myspace].  It seems he has a soft spot for, neckbeards, [[fat|fatties]], [[cosplay|cosplayers]] and politicians.  Also, [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|cocks]].
