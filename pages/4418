[[File:JosephDucreux1.jpg|center|300px]]

'''Joseph Ducreux''' was a [[French]] artist with a keen perception of himself. This was an artist with class, and he wasn't afraid in show this in his unconventional self-portraits. Ducreux added new things into the mix such as portraits of himself [[lol|laughing]] or yawning. Even today, people around the world, and more importantly, on the [[Internet]], are amused by his work &ndash; so much so that his self-portraits are often used in humorous image macros and videos.
