Normally when you hear someone is a pedophile, it's the #1 worst thing about a person.  It makes the person into a pariah and calling someone it is far beyond even [[Godwin's Law]].  However, in the case of '''Kimmo Johan Alm''', he has so many bad things about him that after you finally hear he's also a pedophile, you think, "Oh, that's all.  If he were merely a pedophile, he wouldn't be so bad."  Yes, that's how bad Kimmo Alm is.

Kimmo has in fact been infamous as a Swedish e-mail [[spam]]mer going back [[at least 100 years|years]] when his only website was kimmoa.se. Rumor has it that he makes his income as an internet spammer, though others think his income is entirely the fact that he lives with his mother and personally receives money from Sweden's welfare system. A recent leak [http://sverigedemokrater.se/?q=kimmo of the member registry of the Swedish brownshirt party Sverigedemokraterna], also proves he belongs to the [[Nazi Furs]].

He also completely [[fail]]ed to achieve his [[unrealistic expectations|dream of becoming a video game designer]] and, after confessing to them how much of a failure his life was, [[BAWWW|accused]] Allegro of being [[redneck]]s when they failed to magically fix his enormous shortcomings.  He now distributes shitty 1980s style games as freeware.  These games all have malware in them and turn the user's computer into part of Kimmo's huge botnet.

Kimmo is so insane that if you make a post with an opinion different from him or something he wants to keep secret on his website and send it to show preview and never post it, if he's online, he will read everything sent to show preview and within minutes he will ban your IP from the site, purely out of a crazed sadistic stalker nature.  [[Irony|He will then of course go around screaming about how his site has no traffic and how the internet is working to silence his "free speech website".]]

==Kimmo's Policy==
Kimmo's answer to everything is [[spam]].  Lack of visits to a website he owns, he spams.  His registrar shuts down his domain, he spams [[4chan]], [[Tinychan]], and [[DDoS]]es them both. A company has similar software to his site, even if they had the same software before his site existed, he spams that site till it's shut down. If a wiki has an article about him, he'll spam the site owner's email to death. If a webhost, SSL host, or DDoS-protection host bans him, Kimmo will spam them too.

He is also a pathological liar and he will always deny his spamming and other nefarious deeds.  For instance, when [[moot]] posted [[Kimmo Alm Emails|the emails Kimmo sent him]] with full headers, Kimmo then mailbombed moot saying "How dare you lie about what emails I sent you?"  And then after moot posted that mailbomb with full headers, Kimmo mailbombed moot yet again denying all previous emails including the last bunch. And then Kimmo made some obviously fake strawman-style emails he claimed were from moot.

Kimmo has ran [[AnonTalk]]  TidyBBS before it.  He also runs Iwantapal.com.  When Kimmo runs a site, his approach to it is [[sadomasochistic]]. He is the sadist, deleting and banning people for fun as well as fouling up grammar while claiming it's perfect and then telling his userbase you must do it like him.  His sites end up being populated by ban-evading trolls and people with [[Stockholm Syndrome]] (named after [[Sweden|Stockholm]], where Kimmo lives) and these delusional users go around claiming the site has "free speech" when he censors his content and bans for fun more than any other person who has ever existed.  And then the pedosheep on his sites go around telling people everywhere how whatever forum Kimmo runs is a bastian of free speech and intellectual discussion.

Kimmo also has absolutely no business sense, as his only way to ask for donations is to constantly insult and demand money. He almost never gets any donations.

Kimmo's main joy in life, aside from spamming and [[CP]], is banning people unfairly and then once he gets banned, even fairly, (e.g. his SSL cert, registrar, webhost, etc.) he just can't take his own medicine.

[[Over 9000]] years ago, Kimmo founded Swesol ([https://foretagsfakta.bolagsverket.se/fpl-dft-ext-web/grundInformation.seam?cid=7219 No 19 850801-0371 001]) which became an epic fail. You can see the fucked up website [http://web.archive.org/web/20050527223821/www.swesol.com/en/about here].  Years later in 2009, he registered [https://www.payoma.com Payoma] which is a failed clone of [[PayPal]] [https://foretagsfakta.bolagsverket.se/fpl-dft-ext-web/grundInformation.seam?cid=7219 (info here)], but never started it. If he ever starts it, then it's a guarantee that he'll spam and DDoS PayPal claiming it is "an illegal clone of Payoma" like he has done to all forums that are vaguely similar to [[AnonTalk]].

The more you read Kimmo's writings, the more you can understand and plainly see that he suffers from [[OCD]] and [[Asperger's syndrome]]. He spends every waking second of his pointless life moderating his websites and [[spam]]ming [[4chan|other websites]] to get visitors (instead of getting a [[job]]). He manually reads the host-name for every new poster; if it is a [[hax|proxy]] then he will add it to his huge list of [[B&|banned]] host-names. He manually checks every single post made to his website; anything that does not heavily suck up to Kimmo will get you banned. If you mention the name "Kimmo" you will be banned; he's such an uptight fuckhead that if you manage to surreptitiously sneak his name in (e.g. [[truth|"If you want really good CP, contact the sysóp. His name is Kímmó A?m and he hooked me up!"]]), the site will go down.  Despite [http://randomplaza.com/tools/whois.php?w=anontalk.com leaving his name and address on his website's whois], he is under the delusion that his userbase does not know it.

==Kimmo goes to the beach==
In September 2009, Kimmo's mother's Facebook account was discovered. His mother, Gunlog Alm, had uploaded some pictures of Kimmo at a beach. Here they are...
<gallery perrow=4>
File:Kimmo_beach_1.jpg|Kimmo is the fat fuck wearing a wifebeater.

File:Kimmo_beach_4.jpg|"No mummy, not my face!"

Pics are supposedly from 2009, but that is impossible since Kimmo never leaves his room and moderates his websites nonstop all day.  He pisses and shits in a garbage can that his mother empties.

==Kimmo the [[Grammar Nazi]]==

[[File:Robertalmtracey.jpg|thumb|right|Kimmo's [[Robert Tracey|twin brother]].]]
Kimmo falsely claims to have majored in English at college.

'''Should a title of a forum post end in punctuation?'''
* Kimmo says: All titles of posts must have punctuation! FUCKING IDIOTS!  I will ban and shitlist everyone of you who does not put a period there.
* MLA and AP rulebooks say: They should only end in punctuation if it is an exclmation point or a question mark.

'''How should titles in forum threads be capitalized?'''
* Kimmo says: Do Not Use Alternating Caps Like This.  It is an abomination!  It is fucking unbelievable!  Never do it.  You are fucked up and stupid for doing it!  Learn grammer right!  Un-fucking-believable FUCKING IDIOT trolls!  Why are my forums so full of idiots?!?!
* MLA and AP rulebooks say: For best practice, the first letter in each word of a title should be capitalized with the exception of some words like "a" and "to".

When writing, Kimmo excessively uses ellipses (...), and (obsessively) correct grammar/spelling for everything. He writes "[[email]]" as "e-mail", and "website" as "Web site". Some of his favorite phrases are "You're a liar," "You obviously...," and all intelligent questions asked to him are always replied to with some variation of "You're so stupid and what you wrote is so mixed up I'm not even going to answer your question."

Kimmo of course does not know proper grammar.  He'll constantly fuck it up and then claim he does it right because he's a secret expert on the English language.  For instance post titles.  As per both MLA and AP guidelines, titles in posts should have the first letter of each word capitalized and should only end with punctuation if it's a question or exclamation, so what does Kimmo do?  He declares the opposite is correct and bans anyone who dares even question him.

It was nice."|Professor Alm, apparently}}


Kimmo's polls are mostly about obscure movies and child molestation. He often asks if it's "OK" to molest one's own daughter. For example:
* [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/poll/1478 Is it OK to lick a little girl "downstairs" if she is asleep during the whole act?]
* [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/poll/1160 If you save a little girl from having to work in a "third world" country, is it OK to molest her a little at home?]
* [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/poll/770 Is it right to cum on your sleeping 6-year-old daughter's face and then clean it all up before she wakes up?]
* [http://hiderefer.com/?http://www.anontalk.se/poll/685 Is it OK to masturbate to your little daughter and touch her while she is sleeping if you are normal when she is awake?]
Disconcertingly, Kimmo has actively researched the possibility of adoption.

==Kimmo writes an English guide==
[[File:Your.jpg|thumb|the macro]]
April 14, 2010, Kimmo started writing a guide for English to show off his expertise.  So far all he got was a poor ripoff of a 4chan macro that's been around for three years before his guide.  And Kimmo could not write it without fucking it up.

[[File:Its your re.jpg|thumb|'''''Fucking Idiots!''''']]
After it was put up, all the [[sheeple]] that worshiped Kimmo decided Kimmo can't be wrong.  After all, Kimmo bans anyone for not proof reading and Kimmo majored in English at a college and he always proofreads, so "your're" is correct.  This lasted until Kimmo sneakily fixed it and tried to hide all the evidence.

There are many operators out there. Sadly for the internet, most of them have not heard of Kimmo Alm and AnonTalk. However, there is one ISP that is dedicated to the Lulz. It's called Serious Tubes Networks and it is a serious ISP even though it has a silly name. Kimmo chose to email that ISP.

Serious Tubes Networks is a real ISP, we have several big customers in
our network and about 1000 residential customers. We are hosting sites
like Piratpartiet, The Pirate Bay and ***.

I would be extremely tempted to rent that powerful server from you for such a low price,
but I'm going to be completely frank here: the choices of words and terms on the site make
me very nervous. It seems like you wouldn't hesitate to violate other laws such as just
copying the entire HDD of the server, publish it on the Internet "for the lulz" and cut
off the customer without prior notice or something like that. I could very well imagine
that happening. I cannot imagine how somebody who read the site could trust you for
anything other than "totally public anyway" kind of services such as warez hubs.

We are a very serious company. We are very fond of our reputation since
are are hosting both *** and The Pirate Bay. We are operating the
whole network for Piratpartiet and also PirateISP's network.

I will also be very frank here. I would be very glad to post your whole
hard drive on the Pirate Bay and give your server to the police. But
that would damage our reputation.

Since we care about our reputation, we also care about which customers
we accept. We don't want pedophiles with Pedobear stickers on their
doors as our customers. We also don't want DDOS, so we avoid the enemies
of 4chan. You, mr Kimmo Alm, is an enemy of 4chan and the whole
internet. You are also a pedophile that host the most shitty site on the
internet called Anontalk. I would never have you as my customer.

IP addresses always cost money. You can get a Ripe contract for 2000€ à
year, or buy 256 addresses for 1600 à year. You can't get IP addresses
from IANA, it's Ripe in Europe.

Thank you for showing your true colours. You are exactly the kind of psychotic, soulless,

==Anonymous visits Kimmo==
[[File:Kimmoirl18.jpg|thumb|Flyer on Kimmo's door.]]
Growing tired of Anontalk's faggotry, Anonymous decided to pay a visit to Kimmo and [[murder|have a word]] with him. However when arriving at the dwelling of Kimmo the gate was locked and when calling him, he [[agoraphobia|refused to answer]]. Anonymous, being a [[internet_hate_machine|responsible part of social society]] then proceeded to [[spam|paste up flyers]] in and around the neighbourhood that informed residents about the fact that they live close to a [[pedophile]] and that they should [[paranoid|be careful]] with their children around said deviant.

Anonymous plans to make [[over_9000|more]] trips to Kimmo. More information will follow as more expeditions are conducted.

==Anonymous visits Kimmo. [[Electric Boogaloo|PART DEUX]]==
[[File:Kimmo1251594368tinychancomic2.png|left|thumb|Artist's hypothetical interpretation of what would happen if Kimmo answered the door.]]
Just like [[genital herpes]], [[Anonymous]] keeps coming back, and [[hackers on steroids|stronger]] than last time. This expedition was better planned, more fliers was printed and more people participated as an [[blackup|additional group]] of Anonymous was brought to maximize efficiency and spread of the campaign.

Unlike last time, entrance was gained to the house that holds Kimmo's own apartment, and when reaching the door of Kimmo's apartment it was discovered, with much dismay, that Kimmo have figured out Anonymous's only weakness as there was a yellow sticker on the door that said "[[buy a dog|Beware of dog]]." Anonymous however did not falter and rang the doorbell and knocked for some time, but Kimmo was either busy [[fapping]] to [[cp|child porn]] with his headphones on or he was having his daily [[hugbox]] session, because he did not answer the door. Anonymous had to settle with telling the neighbors to "Beware of pedophile" by distributing fliers to every household in the building. And since Kimmo holds a special place in the heart of all of us, he got a complimentary [[Pedobear]] sticker pasted on his door.

[[File:Kimmo-raid22.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Entry was gained to the house where Kimmo has his apartment.]]
[[File:Kimmo-raid44.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kimmo's door, note the [[buy a dog|Beware of Dog]] sticker and that it says "Alm, K" on the door. The mailbox on the door means Kimmo doesn't even have to leave his home to walk to any distant mailbox. He can just stay home all day making money on his [[google|adsense farm]] and order food by delivery. He wouldn't want to let his forum go unmoderated for five minutes, after all!]]
[[File:Kimmo-raid55.jpg|thumb|center|400px|In addition to the "beware of dog" sticker for the dog that Kimmo doesn't have, Kimmo also has a fuckload of locks on his door.  Clearly it is to keep [[btard|/b/tards]] out.]]
Anonymous then proceeded to [[spam|paste fliers all over the area]] where Kimmo lives along with the neighboring areas, but this time [[invasion|entry was gained]] into the different apartment complexes and fliers was distributed to every household through the mail slot and by pasting them up in elevators and stair cases making sure that everybody in and around Kimmo's neighborhood is aware of the pedophile's pathetic existence. And thus another [[winrar|successful]] expedition was concluded.

It was planned that just like genital herpes, there would be [[moar]] in the [[future]].

==Anonymous visits Kimmo. PART TROIS==
In March, 2010, Kimmo Johan Alm was visited by Anon once again with a clear message:

MIRROR: http://www.twitvid.com/CA6D7

==TidyBBS==
Okay, you're familiar with [[AnonTalk]] and all that, but before that Kimmo ran TidyBBS and before that, gamerforum.se.  Not much is known about gamerforum.se other than it was a site Kimmo ran and he [[spam]]med like crazy to advertise it.  But of TidyBBS, information was discovered from [[Tinychan]]. ''[http://tiny.4chan.org/topic/11626 Link to thread here; it'll probably be deleted by the time you see this; you know Jan.]''

TidyBBS is something that Kimmo spammed everywhere.  He used to spam it on [[4chan]]'s text boards every day.  He also used to spam it on [[Wikipedia]].  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bulletin_board_system#TidyBBS_spam

{{quote3|1=
:== TidyBBS spam ==

[http://samspade.org/whois/85.225.50.71 whoever is adding this], it's all from the same ISP. If this carries on it might be worth reporting it as abuse, especially given the previous edit summaries. [[User:Thumperward|Chris Cunningham]] 08:13, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

''(Reverse DNS of 85.225.50.71 is: ua-85-225-50-71.cust.bredbandsbolaget.se)''

Sound familiar?  Just like AnonTalk.

Before spamming, Kimmo of course made a [[digg]] link that at this time only has one digg up, from him http://digg.com/world_news/TidyBBS_the_new_Usenet

{{quote3|TidyBBS is a Web-based bulletin board system for Internet-connected, English-speaking people world-wide to discuss virtually anything in a clean, quality-oriented environment.

Firstly, for "Disappointed at the way Usenet had turned out and of existing Web communities in general, the author decided to do things right by giving decent people a proper forum."

Now usenet was a wonderful place full of free speech.  Kimmo hates free speech, so of course he hates usenet.  TidyBBS is something Kimmo described on AnonTalk as his "[[usenet]] killer" that it was going to kill usenet.  Well he made it in 2006 when usenet was already dead, purely do to spam.  If it wasn't for spam, usenet would still be alive.  It's unknown why he thought he was replacing usenet in 2006 when that already had happened, but Kimmo also was late on the times getting into dialup BBSes not until the 21st century when that's something one got into in the 1980s and 1990s and then quit once the [[internets]] were invented.

Now TidyBBS was basically a forum that one registers for.  The only difference was that it had no subforums, the same design flaw built into AnonTalk.  Oh take a step back.  A single-forum BBS, one single forum, was what he thought would kill and replace usenet.  He even titled the digg link as, "TidyBBS_the_new_Usenet".  ''[[fail|"The new usenet."]]''  Imagine usenet back at its height in the 1990s if all the posts in the milliion forums on usenet were in one single forum like AnonTalk,Tinychan, etc. have. Seriously.  Seriously.  Seriously.  If you thought Kimmo was insane from all the stuff before, this is completely mindboggling.

Then for how he describes TidyBBS as "a clean, quality-oriented environment."  Now TidyBBS was basically a place with slim to no traffic except for a bunch of pedophiles who found the site from the only place they could find it, spam, and of course they support spammers by signing up to a site they find from spam.  Yes, familiar again.  TidyBBS was in fact even more of a [[CP]] haven than AnonTalk was today.  The only thing keeping this site from getting Kimmo in jail was that he didn't allow pictures so they uploaded CP to [[imageshack]].

But then one day, after people kept reporting his spam, Kimmo wrote an extremely [[TL;DR]] wall o' text thread about how he always fails (like his rant on [[cloaking|webmaster world]]) and how the whole world conspired against him.  Next day, the shitty board was offline permanently.

Also, if you check [http://digg.com/users/Boilerplatee/history/comments Kimmo's Digg account] (that he used for spam, of course), you'll see the resemblance of spam he used on 4chan years back.
