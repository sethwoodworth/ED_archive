[[Image:Usability.jpg|thumb|Lol, epic fail]]
'''[[nawlins|Nawlin]]Wiki''' is a [[Wikipedia]] administrator of mixed [[Indian]] and [[African American]] descent, and aside from [[bot]]s, is probably one of the most active Wikipedians ever on any wiki run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. As of November 2008, he stands at a mere #15 in terms of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits/latest human editors' rankings], but had made 119,916 (or [[over 9000|1.19916 * 10 ^ 5]]) edits. NawlinWiki started out on Wikipedia in 2004 as a typical IP editor writing a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|conflict-of-interest]] article [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.0.100.9 about his great-aunt]. He then registered an account in 2005, whilst his hometown was being [[epic]]ally [[pwnt]] by Mother Nature.

As could be expected, [[George Bush doesn't care about black people|NawlinWiki did not get much attention at the time of the flooding]] and as such he found a [[hugbox]] in the form of [[TOW]]. This is fortunate for him because if he'd (this [[article]] will refer to NawlinWiki as male for the sake of not posterity, but clarity) registered an account with the word 'wiki' in it during 2008, a little [[Hitler]] like Maxim would apply the block because since the word 'wiki' refers to a "Wikimedia Foundation process or namespace", it'd be blocked at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:UAA this page] just like a typical [[spam]] account and they'd have lost one of their biggest [[slave|slaves]] for doing their [[Wikipe-tan|dirty work]] without even knowing it.

NawlinWiki is the archetypal [[fake editor]]; others like [[Sceptre]] and [[LaraLove]] try but cannot reach the levels of [[shit nobody cares about|spiritual enlightenment]] (or 'self-actualization' if you are a fan of [[Jewish]] philosophers/psychologists like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Maslow Abraham Maslow] who posited that [[money]] was more important than any [[god|airy-fairy bullshit]]) that NawlinWiki has gained by using the [[criteria for speedy deletion]] as a meditation technique (why ''meditation'', [[O RLY?|you ask]]? More on that later in this [[article]]).

A while back, NawlinWiki, being the [[asspie]] [[robot]] [[slave]] that he is, spent almost ''three hours'' solid [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&dir=prev&offset=20080722034610&limit=202&user=NawlinWiki cleaning up] the debris left behind by [[Grawp]] and his truly massive cock. Not only that, in doing so, he managed to [[lulz|freeze and crash the entire English Wikipedia database several times]]. This was considered an [[epic win]] for us all, and hit the [[Wikipedo]]s [[hard]].  He is the reason why the server crashed in [[Peter Chimaera]]-esque story of [[Alison]].

==Who is NawlinWiki?==
[[Image:Alan-soble.jpg|thumb|False clues led ED investigators to believe momentarily that this was NawlinWiki [[facefagged]] before he became a negro.]]
Prior to the publication of this article brought to you by [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], it was a great [[mystery]] as to the identity of [[NawlinWiki]]. Due to the fact that there is only sparse information on NawlinWiki's userpage, there have been various theories put forward as to who this [[anonymous pussy]] is, all of which involve the assumption that NawlinWiki has [[no life]].

*[[Old]] and retired, with nothing better to do, going by the "remembers using a rotary dial telephone" userbox.
*[[retard|Disabled or crippled]] in a wheelchair, but with the brain still intact and needing [[fapfapfap|stimulation]].
*A feat of artificial intelligence, involving understanding of natural language semantics in a way that no [[computer]] program has ever done before, which would make [[Alan Turing]] [[shit bricks]] in his grave.
*The philosopher of [[sex]], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Soble Alan Soble], who got all his pornographic literature destroyed during the floods of 2005, and then gave up hope and started on [[Wikipedia Porn]] instead.
*A 20 something year old. Based on the age of his grandfather, although they start having babies at ages younger than even [[Chris Hansen]] has busted people for in Africa/India. The "rotary telephone" is probably a lie, although in Africa/India, it wouldn't be surprising!

It is known, however, that NawlinWiki is the [[Chris-chan]] of Wikipedia. Always trollable, always willing to provide moar lulz - you just need to know how to do it.

==The Truth==
[[Image:Kapilavatsyayan.jpg|thumb|[[Wikipedia:Kapila Vatsyayan|This]] is a blood relative of NawlinWiki, no joke. She looks paler than most negro scum, because the recent [[Epic lulz|flooding of Nawlins]] has washed the dirt off her face]]
NawlinWiki is a member of Generation X, and is a thirty-something [[virgin]] and only child who still lives with his parents. His parents were from an [[India]]n immigrant family who moved to the Louisiana area [[at least 100 years ago]]. They have long since realized that the only thing he is good for is for fighting [[vandalism]] and [[spam]] on Wikipedia, but they let him be, because the Indian (that's Indian Indian, not [[Native American]]) work ethic which the family got whilst in contact with [[Protestant]] [[British]] colonists during the 19th century before they emigrated to the [[USA|States]] is deeply ingrained in their culture. This kind of makes him the [[Chris-chan]] of Wikipedia, as he probably still lives with his dad Keshav Malik, who doubtless constantly tells him to stop editing that damned wiki, but Indian style, as opposed to Bob Chandler, who does it redneck style.

His great-aunt is the [[notable]] Indian classical dance teacher [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapila_Vatsyayan Kapila Vatsyayan]. [[Srsly]]. Since [[gypsy|certain peoples with their origins in certain lands in south-central Asia]] mix well with [[nigras|other races]], it can be assumed that NawlinWiki is of the same [[semen|genetic stock]], rendering [[Hagger]]'s belief about NawlinWiki correct.

NawlinWiki also claims to be a [[pedophile|youth soccer referee]].[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/NawlinWiki&diff=70499804&oldid=70486133 ]

[[Nobody gives a fuck|The above logs]] are enough to make any self-respecting [[Wikipedia Review]] member [[facepalm]] for the sake of NawlinWiki himself. However, inside sources from that particular web forum state that NawlinWiki and [[Persian Poet Gal]] are communicating through [[Wikipedo]] [[IRC]] after being set up by each others' parents in an arranged [[marriage]] and will find true WikiLove together and be happy ever after, making babies together so that they raise them for the sole purpose in life of reverting vandalism without [[Jimbo Wales]] even noticing, because Jimbo's fighting off his [[sex]] drive rather than deleting, protecting and salting [[Grawp|HAGGER]] every second of his waking life like the happy couple do. Also, [[cocks]].

NawlinWiki has also been known to visit [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], and in particular [[Talk:Grawp]], the page which is being watched by many [[Wikipedophile]]s. NawlinWiki clearly hasn't discovered [[Talk:Hagger]] yet, the new club for the cool kids of Wikipedia vandalism, but he's not going to go there because [[Hagger]] has a [[predilect]] for referring to NawlinWiki as '[[negro]] scum' for some [[batshit|strange reason]] (hell, even Hagger's [[slave]] has [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NawlinWiki&diff=225681240&oldid=225598066 taken interest in] NawlinWiki). The main reason that NawlinWiki reads the Grawp talk page is to try to prevent page move vandalism from happening in the first place, so he will use [[condom|protection]] on articles that [[EDiots]] have [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Talk:Grawp&diff=1997643216&oldid=1997643197 said that they will vandalize], even if they're [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Talk:Grawp&diff=1997644308&oldid=1997643787 not going to actually do so].

NawlinWiki has also taken to the practice of deleting as many of [[Grawp]]’s edits as he can. This is particularly lulz-worthy, as Grawp can now make him temporarily delete almost any article he wants simply by moving the page. This leads to pwnage of Wikipedia’s servers, for every time NawlinWiki deletes a page with close to or over a thousand revisions, it temporarily slows down and sometimes even freezes Wikipedia’s shitty database. Examples of this censorship can be seen [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&dir=prev&offset=20080722034610&limit=487&user=NawlinWiki here] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&dir=prev&offset=20080714112945&limit=500&user=NawlinWiki here] in the pages whose links are blue.

NawlinWiki maintains a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NawlinWiki/List_of_things_that_will_get_speedily_deleted list of things that will get speedily deleted] in his userspace. Being one of the most active [[Wikipedia admins]] in the field of the [[criteria for speedy deletion]] (rivalled ONLY, and we really mean ONLY, by [[DerHexer]]), everyone else in the [[Cabal]] pretty much trusts his judgment and allows him to delete whatever he fucking feels like. This page in his userspace also violates [[wikipedese|WP:BITE]], because it’s telling newcomers that [[nobody cares]] about [[Fat Larry's Band|your garage band]]. Also, articles about sex practices clearly do not meet CSD A7 and do not meet G1 or G3 if they are written coherently, so there is no justification other than [[Ignore All Rules]] for NawlinWiki to speedily [[pwn]] articles about “the sex practice involving excretory functions that you just made up,” in his own words. They must instead be taken to [[AFD]] or [[PROD]], because Wikipedos are obsessed with rules and process.

Unlike many other Wikipedians, NawlinWiki is not strong on [[talk page|communication]] and spending hours discussing policy changes etcetera. He tends to just get on with the job and take things into his own hands, and never questions his own actions, therefore doesn't feel the need to discuss them with others.

The [[faggotry]] and [[cunt]]ishness of NawlinWiki made it to the [[blog]]osphere some time back - here, [http://ohhelloexclamationpoint.blogspot.com/2006/09/nawlinwiki-i-give-you-this-medal.html a blogger talks about NawlinWiki's faggotry back in 2006.] She really gave NawlinWiki a good verbal [[rape|grilling]] here.

nawlinwiki is not only a [[Josef Fritzl|monster]], he is [[aspierations|severely misguided]] as to [[porn|what the internet is for]]. the internet is not about knowledge; the internet is not a [[university|library]]; and the internet is certainly [[ad hominem|no place for a person like nawlinwiki]]. no, the internet is a place for:

The comments left after that post tend to reflect the existing [[lulz|body of knowledge]] that we all have about NawlinWiki. Among these...

{{quote|You will notice that lots of people are complaining that he's deleted their favorite articles now. My guess? He is a [[internet hate machine|berserk robot]].

It's a good thing they tried out this technology on Wikipedia first. If they had gone straight to traffic cops, Nawlinwiki would be [[ethnic cleansing|vaporizing ugly cars]].|See, he is a fucking [[robot]] after all.}}

{{quote|or he might be the [[cop]] that pulled over rhianna last night. we were totally caught [[pimp|ridin' dirty]]. by that, i mean: he was speeding and Rhianna pulled out in front of him. he was [[black]] and [[USI|pushy]] and [[drugs|hallucinated]] her high lights being on.|He is also a [[negro]] as suggested by [[Hagger]].}}

{{quote|I hate this bastard. [[threats of violence|He must die]].|An [[anonymous]] editor makes a [[TOV|death threat]] against NawlinWiki.}}

Amazingly, that last one is not the first death threat that NawlinWiki has been given - some [[idiot]] made a death threat against him [[Last Thursday]] for his '[[censorship]]', and it is not known whether this person enjoyed a ride in the [[party van]] afterwords. [[Famous]] musician [[wigger|Tom Waits]] has the following to say about Nawlins and NawlinWiki:

{{quote|Well, I wish I was in New Orleans, I can see it in my [[fap|dreams]],
Arm-in-arm down [[alcohol|Burgundy]], a [[alcoholic|bottle]] and my friends and me|Tom Waits on how he'd like to go to Nawlins and [[pwn]] NawlinWiki by getting him drunk for the first time... it's not against Hindus' religion to drink alcohol, you know, unlike with [[Muslim]]s.}}

NawlinWiki also receives complaints when he freezes and slows down Wikipedia’s servers by deleting [[Grawp]]’s edits from articles. Here are a few examples:

{{quote|When NawlinWiki was doing all his Grawp deletions the other month, the server was being locked down constantly. Only for a couple minutes at a time, but he was causing it repeatedly.

**Fair point, however, it's not feasible to remove every edit with a summary that contains some rough language. I'm still not convinced that there is a good reason to be doing this.

***Personally, I'm in favor of the deletion, simply because the two links he usually provides (see his recent "edit" to [[Wikipedia:Kim Kardashian|Kim Kardashian]] if you need reminding). The one link is to his entry at E.D., and the other one (nimp) is to a page that will crash your browser. I'm of the opinion that one does not leave a live grenade (i.e., nimp) where the unsuspecting will discover it. Although, if you ask me, better yet would be the ability to somehow redact those links from the edit summary...

****I'd like to request a cease to the selective deletions also. It's obvious vandalism: Preventing someone from copy-pasting or retyping a link at the cost of doing selective deletions isn't worth lagging the project. Instead of doing this, support and encourage the developers and sysadmins in implementing the newer deletion system. If nothing else, someone'll click on a nimp link only once.

*****If I may interject I'm actually quite glad he's doing so in this case. I don't know about you fellows but I'd rather not check an article's history when on my laptop in a public place only to find "HUGE TITS" etc in glaring red on the page for any passerby to notice...--[[Wikipedia:User:Kung Fu Man|Kung Fu Man]] ([[Wikipedia:User talk:Kung Fu Man|talk]]) 11:50, 19 September 2008 (UTC)
