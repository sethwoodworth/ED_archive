'''Weird Al Yankovic''' is a lyrical [[troll]] who has parodied every song ''ever'' from [[at least 100 years ago]] to now, with the exception of any actually good songs, most likely because any changes can only make them better, regardless of what they are. Weird Al is goddamn good at hilariously renaming the songs for his parodies. "American Idiot" becomes "Canadian Idiot"! GENIUS!! The only redeeming quality he has is that fans are expecting Weird Al to create a parody of [[lol | Chocolate Rain]] for his next album. 

Weird Al is one of the few celebrities who are a [[vegetarian]], and according to inside sources, he attempts, like all dumb-ass vegetarians, to guilt people into becoming vegetarian as well. He also claims to be the inventor of the "[[cock|Twinkie Wiener]] Sandwich", which in itself makes him [[batshit insane]]. It is believed that parodying shitty music could be some sort of immortality elixir, explaining why Weird Al has been around so long. And if that turns out to be true, that's fucking copyrighted to [[This website|ED]].

[[Tl;dr]], all parody songs that you hear on the internet, regardless, were always made by Weird Al. (See Below for Proof.)

==Fans==
His fans just LOOOOVE repeating lyrics from his [[old meme|"classic songs"]]. These virgins freak out whenever a new song is made, for example: when [[Wigger|''White and Nerdy'']] came out, there were mass [[circle jerk]]s held by nerds the world over. 

==YOU SUCK!==

<center>{{frame|[[Image:WhiteNerdyYOUSUCK.jpg]]|color=#544E68}}</center>

The [[Wikipedia]] page on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Records Atlantic Records] is constantly being [[vandalism|vandalized]] with the words "YOU SUCK!" like in the White & Nerdy video. Typically, this results in recieving the [[banhammer]] and the page being [[fail|semi-protected]]. [[Atlantic Records|ED's article on it]], on the other hand, is [[lie|very factual]], and is in no way, shape, or form [[Kittens|trying to trick you]].

==Lol, Offended==
Weird Al music can be used for [[trolling]] those who take [[shit band|their band]] too [[srsly]]. Also Used to cause controversial [[rage]] and [[drama]] between different communities, when truly,[[shit nobody cares about | no one gives a shit]].
* [http://forums.canadiancontent.net/news/53485-canadian-stereotypes-abound-net-thanks.html Butthurt Canaedian (named TORONTO [[CP]]), bitching about the lyrics in Al’s song “Canadian Idiot” says how “Americans know little about their northern neighbours”. Again, [[shit nobody cares about | no one cares]] but still very lulzy.]
Weird Al’s resurrection of “Gangsta’s Paradise” offended rapper “Coolio” because he found out his song was better. So he caused lulz and drama backstage at the 1996 Grammy awards with this rant:
* {{quote | [http://weirdal.0catch.com/txt/coolio.html I ain't with that. No. I didn't give it any sanction. I think that my song was too serious. It ain't like it was "Beat It." "Beat It" was a party song. But I think "Gangsta's Paradise" represented something more than that. And I really, honestly and truly, don't appreciate him desecrating the song like that. I think he's wrong for that, because his record company asked for my permission, and I said no. But they did it anyway. I couldn't stop him. But you know, more power to him. I hope they sell a lot of records. Just stay away from me.] | “Coolio” – “Gangsta’s paradise is [[Serious Business|SRS BUSINESS]]” }}
He also created a song where he [[Rap|bitches]] about Weird Al for a segment of the song. Quoted in the link above. The rapper wanted the song to be taken down, but it wasn’t, turns out it wasn’t even his song in the first place, lol.
* [http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070401114803AArvYMN “Why is the song White and Nerdy not considered racist?” Typical white guy screaming racist on Yahoo Answers.]

The effectiveness of this tactic is unfortunately limited by the obviously [[lulzy]] intent of using the song. If the target finds the song funny, you're [[doing it wrong]] and simply suggest you [[An Hero|try other Methods]]. However, if you are successful tell them to follow the instructions on the banner above.

==The One Who Started It ALL==

It is in fact, no doubt, that every parody song you hear to on the [[internets]] was created by Weird Al, unless it's [[Justin Bieber|shitty]]. It will whether it’s himself Weird Al Yankovic or his evil twin, Weird Al Yankovich. [[limewire|Music sharing]] sites are full of these!  You could [[sell out|spread the word and set people straight]], or you could [[lulz|just let it go]]. Here are some examples of his unknown masterpieces:
