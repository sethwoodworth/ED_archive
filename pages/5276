In the early hours of October 15, 2007, the clever folks over at "e/b/aum's World" decided to publicize aka destroy the private life of two teenagers. The first, a [[whore|conservative]] girl named Gianna, and secondly, her loving and [[lie|LOL trusting]] boyfriend Daniel.

While most people know that posting videos of themselves masturbating online is generally a [[lulz|terrible idea]], one high school student from New Jersey named Gianna didn't happen to think so. Therefore, she decided to upload a video of herself [[masturbation|diddling her snatch]] on [[photobucket|Photobucket]]. While this happens regularly, it didn't stop there. 

Unfortunately for Gianna, worse for her boyfriend, and fucking awesome for her boyfriend's friends, one of the many worker drones of [[ebaumsworld|Anonymous]] found said video. With much research, a [[MySpace]] account of her and her boyfriend was found. Of course, the laws of the Internets dictate that said porn should be posted all over her boyfriend's blog. The same blog in which he [[cliche|professed his faggoty undying teenage love for her.]]

The video was, of course, [[CP|fukken saved]] from [[photobucket|Photofucket]] by a number of pplz and uploaded to [[YouTube]] for another thousand or so lulz, until it was taken down an hour later... Because Youtube moderators usually [[procrastination|take anywhere from 20-60 minutes]] to [[masturbation|fap]] to and backup [[pedophilia|CP]] before they delete it from the main server.

hahaha i find it kind of funny cause you dont seem like the type.</center>|The BFF|}}

{{Quote|<center>gianna, why did i get 2 messages of people sending me videos of you doing

...stuf....</center>|A Myspace "friend"}}

Around 7:29 a.m. (EST), the boyfriend stumbled upon the immense raep that was his MySpace blog comments. In an angsty fit, he proceeded to [[Butthurt|delete all his blogs]].

The case of Megachiropetra69 is yet again, another solid example of why not to post your private life anywhere on the internets. Because lulz will be had, and [[Fox News|Faux News]] will be one step closer to doing another televised special where we all witness the victims purchase another set of curtains and another harmless canine to visibly ward away the invisible intruders. LOL justice.
