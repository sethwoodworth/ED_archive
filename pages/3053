Fran Ingram
{{potential}}

<b>Fran Ingram</b> is one of the most prominent [[Islam|Muslim]] bashers on [[Failbook]].  But unlike [[ED]], which [[for the lulz|does it for the lulz]], Mrs. Ingram does it because she's genuinely retarded.  She's a prominent member of Dove World Outreach, which seems to be like a cross between [[Fred Phelps]] and [[Scientology]] (srsly, it's Florida, and Gainseville isn't that far from Clearwater, right?) and a contributor to things like "International Burn A Koran Day".  [[Al Gore|Algore]] probably hates her for encouraging global warming.  She seems to be the reason that [[Ska|Less Than Jake]] has written so many songs about getting the hell out of Gainseville.

And yes, someone actually saw fit to marry this hate filled hosebeast.

{{squote|Moslems are slaves to a violent intolerant oppressive deceptive ideology. The Koran does not merit respect or honor. It should be burned like the sorcerer's scrolls in Acts 19. It is demonic, evil, dangerous teaching.}}

{{squote|@SoCalstylez858 what's that got to do with the teaching of the Koran? as a Moslem you believe in a God of hate and violence. he is a terrorist. you need to read Mosab Yousef's book Son of Hamas}}
