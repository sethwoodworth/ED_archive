Eugenics
[[Image:CWC eugenics.png|thumb|300px|$2000+ a day is what this person suffering from [[autism|hereditary defects]] costs the People's community during his lifetime. Comrade, that is your money too.]]

'''Eugenics''' is the undeniable law that some people simply should never under any circumstances pass on their genes.Although there are [[furry|many]], [[adult babies|many]], [[otherkin|many]] people who deserve this treatment [[IDIFTL|for the sake of simplicity]] this article will focus primarily on those with [[Asperger's Syndrome]] as they are the most common type of sub-human on the internet.

Some people think that in order to save the planet, instead of ripping out their gonads, people should instead opt for [[vegetarianism]]. Such people are [[retarded]] and should be sterilized.

==Action T4==
Although some people enjoy having such people around [[troll|as they provide hours of entertainment]] and makes us glad that we are not one of them, sometimes [[castrate|neutering]] is not enough. '''Action T4''' was a mission set out by [[Nazis|a few enlightened individuals]] who accepted that some people are simply not worth keeping alive. 

== The American Way ==
In the period from 1920 to 1960, most US state hospitals practiced eugenics to weed out any future criminals, addicts, mentally ill, perverts and retards from further procreation. However, the US wasn't really ahead of the Germans when it came to "racial hygeine" when it failed to reach the "final solution" of its' racial minority problem.


==[[Chris chan|Arguments For]]==
The argument for both action T4 and eugenics is simple: there are too many people with [[Autism]].

People with autism, especially asperger's syndrome make life miserable for themselves and others (mainly others) and serve no purpose except to be [[trolls|used as sport]] by normal humans. Most importantly, not only does action T4 help people with assperger's by putting an end to their [[fail|suffering]] it helps people who think they have asperger's, along with all the normal people who have to put up with them.

More and more people are misdiagnosing themselves as being autistic simply because autism is very popular at the moment (just like [[ADHD]] and [[Bipolar disorder]] was in the [[1990s]]) and they like to delude themselves into thinking their sad, non-existant sex life is the result of an incurable disorder and not due to the fact they are complete and utter fucktards who should have been smothered at birth.

As the autistic population swiftly dwindles, people pretending to have [[asperger's syndrome]] will quickly vanish. This will not only lead to less self-diagnosed morons, it will also make those who genuinely have autism easier to spot and [[murder|eliminate]]. This is a [[win]]-[[win]] situation. After all, when everybody is [[retarded|special]] - it's not quite so special anymore.

But then, what will be the next popular [[Faggotry|disorder?]]

==Save Money by Supporting Action T4!==
<center>{{morphquote|autismcost|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|The annual cost of autistic disorder on the UK is at least £1 billion|That's $1,631,001,826.76 (USA) as of 2009.

|The average additional lifetime cost resulting from autism and associated learning disabilities is estimated to be £2,940,538|<i>PER PERSON</i>

|The greatest costs are for living support (70%) and day activities (14%); much less is spent on education (7%).|[http://addsuccess.co.uk/main/Aspergurs_Syndrome_In_Children.asp Tru fax].

==Arguments Against - Refuted==
[[Some argue]] sterilizing people who should have died a long time ago is wrong. Although some enjoy keeping them as pets, others have the strange notion that they are equal to more intelligent and attractive members of the species. These people are called [[Leftards]] but they themselves are not subject to eugenics as they have no [[balls]].


'''People with Autism/Asperger's syndrome often have high IQs'''
*''FALSE:'' People with [[asperger's syndrome]] actually have lower IQs than the general population. In order to be diagosed as a high-functioning autistic [[you]] only need to have an IQ over 70. 


'''People with Autism/Asperger's syndrome are often extremely talented'''
*''FALSE:'' Idiot savants make up only a tiny fraction of those with autism - the rest are barely capable of holding a pencil or writing in their [[Deviantart]] journals without the use of thousands of annoying-as-fuck [[emoticons]].


'''Thomas Edison and Einstein had Asperger's syndrome - this proves that Action T4 is wrong.'''
*''FALSE:'' Like idiot savants the number of people with autism who actually make some useful contribution to the world (like helping create the atomic bomb) is exceedingly small. Most leech off [[Welfare]].  Anyway, Einstein, Edison and most other alleged celebrity autistics are [[lies|"thought'"]] to have had the disease only by Asspies themselves and their parents, unable to face the true horror of their screwed-up genes. [[Asperger's_syndrome#Edison_Was_an_Asspie.2C_So_That_Makes_Me_Speshul.21|This in no way changes the fact that Hitler was an Asspie. This is proven scientifically by the exact same type of evidence claimed by the asspies to support the Einstein Myth.]]


'''Autism may be a disability but it is not hurting anyone else.'''
*''FALSE:'' Due to their inability to empathise autistics are usually more violent than regular people, just like [[psychopaths]]. One of Hans Asperger's first scientific papers on Autism was titled [http://www.drbilllong.com/Autism/Asperger.html "Autistic Psychopathy in Childhood"]. A-Monsters do drain the time, resources and patience of others on a daily basis. However, A-Monsters are oblivious to their impact on others.


'''Action T4 will significantly drop the [[lulz]] of the internet by killing both trolls and targets'''
*''FALSE:'' While this one comes the closest to making sense, only three words need to be said: quality over quantity. Asperger-afflicted trolls are unoriginal hacks spamming the same shit as everyone else and only serve to drive the [[lolcow]]s into hiding faster. Removing them will significantly increase the lulz of all trolling endeavors. Also, by removing people that are merely retarded from the lolcow pool, we can focus on people that are [[Pedophile|truly malicious]] and deserve the full brunt of [[troll]]ing.


'''I have asperger's syndrome and I find this deeply [[offensive]]!'''
*''FALSE:'' [[You]] do not have assburger's syndrome - if you did you would be too much of a social [[fucktard]] to notice people are disgusted by your behaviour.


'''Action T4 is cruel and oppressive.'''
*''FALSE:'' Asspies, like [[furry|other]] [[otherkin|candidates]] for T4, such as [[Jews]] (we almost got them last time), [[Bob Saget]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Niggers]] (I'm sorry massa!) constantly complain about being persecuted ''right now'', even though nobody is doing anything to them.  [[Some argue]] that this is [[fantasy|compensation]] for their [[fail|boring]] lives, and that you should totally help make their dreams a reality.
