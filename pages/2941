Well, yeah, but which one are you looking for?

*''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', the first Final Fantasy game for the [[SNES]]?
*''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', the one with the [[Insane Clown Posse|insane clown]] killing innocents, destroying the world and became a [[God]] for the [[lulz]]?
*''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', the most famous due to rabid FF7 fanboys raving "[[no|"HOLY SHIT TEH BEST VIDYA GAEM EVAR!!1"]]"?
*''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', where you play as the [[emo|lead singer]] of [[Linkin Park]]?
*''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', which is basically ''[[EverQuest]]'' except even more tedious?
*''[[Final Fantasy XIIIâ€Ž]]'', essentially Final Fantasy VII except shinier?
*''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]'', a below 4.0/10 [[fail|game]] that makes ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' more fun and engaging?
*''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', the "different" one?
