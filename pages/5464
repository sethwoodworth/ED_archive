:''This article is about [[IRL]] currency. For [[OL]], see [[Internet money]].
'''Money''' is a term that refers to the medium of exchange in any standardized system of trade.  Ancient cultures had yet to invent [[bullshit]], and so all of their 'money' was actually just a standardized form of barter - they traded a socially agreed upon amount of a certain precious commodity such as salt, or [[semen|white gold]], for goods.

Modern money has the advantage of not having any worth but what is socially agreed upon, because it is now made out of largely worthless metals, and fibers.  [[Allegedly]] these worthless representations of wealth are backed by massive reserves of precious metals, specifically [[Jew Gold]].  In practice, however, nobody really cares as long as you can still afford a [[7-11|slushie]].

If you're an [[azn|Asian]] or a [[poor|third world]] immigrant, you are considered rich by your people if you own [[at least 100]] dollars in your debit card.

There are [[over 9000|many many]] ways to get money.  You can start by getting a [[job]] so you don't stay in your [[basement-dweller|mom's basement]] for the rest of your [[life]].

[[United States]] Dollars are tracked by the government-run site [[Where's George?]].

[[Image:Animation money.gif|thumb|Something [[you]] will never have.]]
Money makes you [[Rich and beautiful|rich]], and having more money than someone else makes them [[pwned]]. You can [[Asses|assess]] how rich and pwning you are on Adam Smith's Riches Calculator. [[divide by 0|The Calculator analyzes what you do when your toilet breaks:]]

* 9 - Your highly paid [[scientist]]s have invented new organs that don't require you to take a [[crap|dump]], so you don't care that your toilet is broken. This is known as the [[shit nobody cares about|don't give a shit]] level.
* 8 - You don't use a toilet any more, your Palestinian slave siphons the [[crap|poo]] from your ass with his mouth while you sleep each night.
* 7 - The toilet attendant fixes the toilet as soon as it breaks without you noticing and then you [[buttsecks|buttrape]] him for not working hard enough probably.
* 6 - THE EQUILIBRIUM: you buy a new toilet.
* 4 - You try and save your wages to buy a new toilet but actually you spend it all on [[alcohol|booze]] to drown the sorrows of your miserable life.
* 4b - [[Daddy]] buys you a new toilet. Worst. Birthday. Ever.
* 2 - [[1guy1jar|You shit in the broken toilet, fall down and slice open your anus on the shards of whatever toilets are made of, causing you to stumble out of your bathroom with blood pouring out from behind.]]
* 1 - Courtney Love's merchandise [[profit]]s.

== Funny money ==
[[Image:Money4.jpg|thumb|[[Sluts]] [[lie|love to be paid in monopoly money]].]]
A slang term that is used to describe any form of money that is not the [[United States]] dollar.  Funny Money is invariably more technically advanced than real money, and often shows its superiority through [[gay|the use of multiple colors on a single bill]], as opposed to the boring dollars monochromatic tones.

It is [[rumor]]ed that [[Europe]]'s Funny Money, [[Lie|the Euro, has a coin that is actually worth as much as it buys.]]

The official currency of [[Vietnam]] is the [[Dong]], which is, of course, hilarious.

NB - Ironically perhaps, the term 'funny money' is a term sometimes applied colloquially in [[Europe]] to counterfeit notes.  Therefore if you're in Paris, Prague or erm... S'''cunt'''horpe then bear in mind you really don't want to fill your wallet up with the stuff, irrespective of what's been said above.  Not to be confused with [[furry]] money, which is money used in transactions to purchase [[animal]] [[sex]].

===Monopoly money===


President [[Obama]] has stated that we cannot treat [[US]] tax dollars like Monopoly money [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2009/12/21/obama_we_cant_treat_tax_dollars_like_monopoly_money.html].

To test this theory we hired a troop of [[scientist]]s and stuff.

Experiment 1 - dollars as Monopoly money

Admittedly dollars do not have the right numbers on the front  but use of an orange crayon can soon convert them. Like [[Lioncash]].

Experiment 2 - as Coke straws

Monopoly money is easier to roll but is a bit small unless you have a Jew nose. Dollars have the advantage of already having traces of cocaine on them and so [[police|CSI]] can't prove it was you. 

Experiment 3 - as cigar lighters

Monopoly money burns a bit too fast but then it cheaper than using dollars to transfer [[fire]]. Both dollars and Monopoly notes can theoretically be used to roll [[drug|joint]]s, but they burn [[shit]]tily, taste shitty and the ink gives you [[cancer]].

Experiment 4 - as toilet paper

Dollars don't allow your fingers to burst through, but Monopoly  money is softer if you have piles.

<pre>Money, get away.
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay.
Money, it's a gas.
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team.

Money, get back.
I'm all right jack keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit.
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.
I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set
And I think I need a lear jet.

Money, it's a crime.
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie.
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today.
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
Giving none away.</pre>

A small organ lodged behind the prostate and ahead of the rectum, in the general region known as the taint. ED routinely encourages its users to stimulate this organ and ejaculate money that can in turn be given to ED so that it can continue bringing you lulz.

Of course, everybody knows that's a scam. Should it have been true though, the solution
instead of giving money would be to stop going to EncyclopediaDramatica, so you wouldn't
invade their precious little wimpy baww bandwidth.
