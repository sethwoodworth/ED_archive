'''View My Death''' was a site dedicated to the latest news stories about people who [[death|die]], [[an hero|kill themselves]] or [[murder|kill other people]]. It was a sort of "Death Bank," as each death was categorized by its cause or the method used: [[Ian Curtis|suicide by rope]], military, [[drugs]], poison, [[Ferrari Guy|car accidents]], freak accidents and many others. It contained many amusing stories of [[suicide]]s, lapses of judgment among teens, [[retard|stupid people]], etc.
