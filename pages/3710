High contrast
[[Image:UGLY_SLUT.jpg|thumb|A prime example of internet disease with high contrasting.  Note the angle of the picture, the black-and-white filter, and a large amount of...well, contrast. Also a prime example for the pro-ana community.]]

'''High contrast''' is a symptom of [[internet disease]] and a photo technique commonly used by people with moderate to severe [[acne]] to hide their blemishes.  One will commonly find this technique used by people on [[MySpace]], but this is usually only applicable to [[angsty teen]]s and [[emo]] kids who are, in every sense of the word, unloved. They will try to pass the high contrast shot as artistic, when in reality they are just spotty. Really, really spotty.  This technique is also common to older individuals (mostly women who have nothing better to do besides sit at their computer and look for attention and cause trouble) who try to hide the aging on their face.  They never tell any one their real age.  On a Myspace page, for example, they may lie about their age or do something "funny" like rack the number up to 99 years old.

Used most commonly with [[fat girl angle shot]] and colorization.
