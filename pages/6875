The '''real world''' is where you no longer live with your parents, you're not in [[school]] and you actually have to get up before noon to put on that [[McDonald's]] uniform and show up for your burger flipping shift.

* The real world is what your $40,000/year liberal arts education was supposed to prepare you for, but didn't.
* The real world is the fact that a 19 year old knows more about programming [[C]] than your college professor learned in 20 "industry" years but can't get hired due to no professional experience.
* The real world is what you face when your 4 year military enlistment is up. Good job, well done, now transition that skill with your M-16 to a paying job out there.
* The real world is a [[fictional]] entity that shits on you when you're down, pisses on your [[shoes]] when you're up, and generally makes your life [[hell]].

The real world shows you to be inadequate, that you're always 17 years old, and you preferred it that way. There is a good reason so many people still live in their [[Basement-dweller|parents' basements]] at 40.

[[Oh noes]].

== How Do I Know I'm In The Real World? ==

Here are some questions to answer:

* Do I live with six other strangers? '''Y/N'''
* Do I live in a loft? '''Y/N'''
* Am I having my [[life]] taped (LiveJournal webcams count and so do cameras hidden in your toilet put there secretly by porn sites)? '''Y/N''' 
* Do I know[[slash|/]]care what happens when people [[drama|stop being polite]] and [[EXTREME|START GETTING REAL]]? '''Y/N'''

If you answered [[yes]] to any of these [[FAQ|frequently asked questions]], congratulations! You are part of the real world.

[[Google]] does not currently index the real world, and so there is no actual [[proof]] that it exists. Reported real-world experiences are suspiciously similar to near-death experiences, both featuring such things as brilliant lights from mysterious sources, feelings of disengagement, and conversations with long-forgotten family members.
