Six Degrees of Dramatization
{{needsmore|examples}}

The '''Six Degrees of Dramatization''' principle recognizes that sometimes [[drama]] comes full circle, creating a meta-drama situation that leads to [[dramouted|dramouting]] and the kind of [[lulz]] that can only come from sheer disbelief.

== Examples ==
===[[teamnoir]] and the case of the [[BDSM|kinky]] [[aspie]]===
#In April 2004, the [[aspie]] article on [[ED]] links to [http://community.livejournal.com/male_dom/749586.html?nc=29 this thread in the] {{ljcomm|maledom}} community. 
#The thread contains comments and a self-diagnosis from [[teamnoir]]. 
#July 2006, more than 2 years later, [[teamnoir]] posts in the {{ljcomm|nlp}} community [http://community.livejournal.com/nlp/23760.html?view=85968 posing the theory that the inventors] of nlp were [[aspie]]s. 
#The clever [[girlvinyl]] links him to the ED article on [[Asperger's syndrome]] -- taking the idiocy full circle in a kind of karmic drama pwn.
