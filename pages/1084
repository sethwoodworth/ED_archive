BoingBoing
From dull 'zine to dull site to dull blogs&mdash;that's '''BoingBoing'''.

==The Zine==
BoingBoing started as a small-time magazine or 'zine, back in the days when [[fucktard|retarded]] people like its founders were not allowed on the [[Internet]]. Possibly copying the vastly superior ''Vague'' and  [http://www.jimgoad.net/ ''ANSWER Me!''], but adding what its [[attention whore|editors]] felt was a "really kewl, like, y'know, dude", [[cyberpunk]] slant. Since it was almost 1990 and even [[Hollywood]] was starting to cash in, they were hardly ahead of the pack, but the time was ripe for the [[morons|target audience]].

==BoingBoing for On-line Retards==
After [[fucktard|retarded]] people started entering the [[Internet]] ''en masse'' in the first half of the 1990s, the [[attention whore]]s at BoingBoing just '''had''' to be there!

===Crappy Site===
BoingBoing became a [[website|web site]] sometime in the late 1990s. By pretending to have connections with Wired, they gained some viewers among [[fucktard|retarded]] and technologically inept [[yuppies]].

Actually a kind of [[spam]] site, they showed their love for their readers with a shitload of advertisements filling four-fifths of the screen.

===Crappier Blog===
[[File:Boingboing.png|thumb|BoingBoing's front page]]
In 2000, caught up in the fire of their desire to keep the rubes thinking them fashionable, BoingBoing went [[blog]]. 
Nauseatingly, they refer to it as "A Directory of Wonderful Things". 

"Directory of Crap Stolen from Other People" would be more like it.
Cleverly, they decided it would be easier to simply link to content from other blogs rather than make any of their own, and have proceeded on that line ever since.

At some stage they also decided that dealing with or even accepting comments was a bit bothersome, so they did away with comments altogether. It is now debatable whether they have a set of blogs produced by a [[circle jerk]] or simply are a circle jerk.  In 2007 they added their comments back in but hired a [[Grammar Nazi]], [[BoingBoing#Teresa_Nielsen_Hayden|TNH]], so that they could be a circle jerk [[fandom|forevar]].

They still have a huge [[spam|advertisement-to-content]] ratio. Since most of the alleged content is [[attention whore|self-promotion]], their slogan should probably be '''All Advertising, All the Time'''.

===[[Cory Doctorow]] <big>is</big> Mr. BoingBoing===
[[Image:VioletBlueFucklist.png|right|thumb|Looks like the Boingers are [[inbred]]. ]]
Though founded by a couple of other losers, BoingBoing were stupid enough to let [[Cory Doctorow]] slime his way in some time this century. Like everything else he touches, Cory is convinced that he has made them '''not suck''', although it's more likely he's turned even more people off the stupid site. Now he '''is''' Mr. BoingBoing, and the others can all go off and [[felching|felch]] his motherfucking [[ass|anus]] for all he cares.

==They <big>Hate</big> Freedom!==
BoingBoing is strongly anti-free-speech and refrains from showing or giving links to any [[porn]] in their rants, unless it's really [[art]]sy shit, making it boring even compared with wastes of space like Sensible Erection and Newsfilter.

==One Not-Quite-Saving Grace==
BoingBoing has '''Xeni Jardin''', the bastard child of a transvestite horse and a clone of [[Madonna]], who decided to go into blogging rather than be accused of being more than a genetic knock-off, Xeni provides [[basement dwellers]] and sexless [[nerds]] a reason to keep checking BoingBoing on an hourly basis in hopes that she'll finally strip nekkid and take on a bunch of Guatemalan communist insurgent troops in a massive gangbang to end all gangbangs. Little do they know she's really a [[lesbian]] intent on converting Cory over to accepting the idea of a sex change from female to male.

==Teresa Nielsen Hayden==
[[Image:TeresaNielsonHayden.png|thumb|TNH passed out with her favorite words.[http://www.boingboing.net/2008/05/20/uk-teen-faces-prosec.html#comment-196155]]]
Tesesa Nielsen Hayden is BoingBoing's pet [[fat whore|cow]] (err- [[comment|"comment moderator"]]).  When she's not [[emo|whining]], [[Bureacratic_Fuck|censoring]] and [[moderator|raging]], she likes to spend her time [[blowjob|pleasuring]] her lackeys Jew and [[mods|Antinous]]. [http://www.arcanology.com/2008/07/03/banned-from-boing-boing/]  Like [[Cory Doctorow]] she is an [[attention whore]] and is stuffed full of [[aids]] and [[fail]].[http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/27/boing-boings-moderat.html] Cawy says that Teresa is a "troll-whisperer" and that she just [http://www.informationweek.com/shared/printableArticle.jhtml?articleID=199600005 pwns trolls].  Apparently, Teresa has never met the [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE]].  Teresa's hobbies include [[buttsecks]], writing horrible, horrible [[science fiction]], [[ljdrama]], and [[wikistalking]].  Her [[fag|buttbuddy]] Cawy Doctorow explains on his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Doctorow#ML.2C_TNH.2C_WBB.2C_TLA__AD_NAUS wikipedia talk page] how Teresa had an hilarious [[flamewar]] with everyone's favorite wikipedia editor: [[Will Beback]]:

"I think that WBB's problem with ML would be that various contributors to the discussion, including TNH herself, posted links to, not just an ED article, but to a specific version of the article from last August which mentioned WBB. While I respect TNH as a person, and admire her work, [[Faggot|I feel that linking to an ED article is very rarely a good idea]]. WBB's reaction to TNH's posting the link is excessive, yes, but have you read what ED said about him?!"

It seems Teresa loves [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] too! Make sure to post lots of links to this article on her site!  Teresa is also such a petty [[cunt]] that she got [[pwned]] by [[Wikipedia]]. She started making [[sockpuppet]]s there and got [[permabanned]].  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Hayden5650] Clearly, there is [[everything|nothing]] [[hypocrite|hypocritical]] about BoingBoing's [[moderator]] using sockpuppets. To top it all off, Teresa is a [[G2g_i_need_sleep|narcoleptic]]. Narcoleptic means that you'll [[Fuck|sleep]] with anyone, anytime. As you can see in the upper picture, TNH is [[Heroin#Heroin|nodding off]].

In an act of [[Unwarranted_self-importance|extreme unwarranted self-importance]] and [[stupidity]], TNH claims that she invented the act of removing the vowels from a word. She calls this [[shit|disembowelment]].  Sadly she uses this to [[I did it for the lulz|remove anyone marginally interesting]] from BoingBoing, when she should [[STFU|use it on the whole site]]. Luckily some [[Anonymous|enterprising fellow]] did disembowel Boing Boing and the [http://www.bngbng.net/ quality is much improved. ]

Notes on abreviations above:

*WBB = Will Beback,     
*ML = Making Light: Teresa's [[Fail|awesome weblog]].  Everyone should [[troll|visit]] her site; where she posts about her [[sarcasm|awesome]] [[Furry porn|interests]],    
*ED = Encyclopedia Dramatica,    
*TNH = Teresa Nielsen Hayden is a [[TLDR|useless name]] that she [[bullshit|made up]] to promote [[feminazi|gender equity]] when she got [[marriage|married]].

On [[9/11|September 11th, 2008]], a chunk of butter in Teresa's system managed to lodge itself into one of her valves and she suffered a heart attack. Unfortunately, she's recovering well in Brooklyn's Lutheran medical Center according to post by her pussy-whipped husband Patrick. Interestingly, however, in the same post he reveals that noted bisexual cat lady Elise Matthesen is their houseguest, conjuring disgusting mental images of fat, fugly nerd threesomes.

If you would like to wish here well, you could try your luck by calling the Lutheran Medical Center at 718-630-7000 .
