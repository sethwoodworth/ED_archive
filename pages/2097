'''[[David]] [[Mudkip]]s''' is the [[anonymous pussy|name]] of a 25-year-old self publicising cockmuncher (and world renowned spokesman for Anon on all things [[Project Chanology]]) who successfully trolled the [[UK]] [[media]] by having his name published in a series of [[tabloid|news]] [[article]]s whilst being interviewed about a [[party]] celebrating the last night of [[alcohol]] being legal to drink on the London Underground which was organised on [[Facebook]].

Even the [[Daily Mail|Daily Fail]] picked up on it, but a whole bunch of other news [[sauce]]s did too...
