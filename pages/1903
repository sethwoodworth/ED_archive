'''Stains''' the [[Dog|Australian Shepard]] is far from the average media hound. Stains is a crazy-eyed dog who struggled with his sweet-tooth appetite. Rather than helping him, Stains' owners decided to exploit him by placing him on [[TV]]. Stains' cupcake video gathered such a large following that his owners started selling Cupcake Dog merchandise.
