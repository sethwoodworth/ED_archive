Travis the Killer Chimp
[[Image:Chimpanzee-glock.jpg|right|thumb|"[[Lie|The chimpanzee shot first.]]"]]

'''Travis the Killer Chimp''' (1995 – [[spoiler|February 16, 2009]]) was a 200lb (91kg) male [[EXTREME ANIMALS|chimpanzee]] who, having been featured in several American television commercials and television shows, was more talented than you ever will be. Named after the sociopathic [[an hero|Travis Bickle]] of "Taxi Driver," he reached worldwide [[TOW|notoriety]] when he was stabbed and [[pwned|killed]] after a sudden, vicious attack on a friend of his keeper while [[OldDirtyBtard|high on Xanax]] and [[Limecat|Lyme]] disease medication. Travis was only 14 when he was brutally murdered by the [[Police Brutality|Stamford police]]. Thus, in chimp years, he was afflicted with dementia. He is most [[notable]] for going <s>[[batshit]]</s> ''apeshit'' insane and [[OM NOM NOM|eating a woman's face and hands]].

As an animal [[drama whore|actor]], Travis had appeared in several television commercials, including spots for Coca-Cola and Old Navy. He had also appeared on ''The [[Maury]] Povich Show'' and appeared in a television pilot that featured Sheryl Crow and [[Michael Moore]].

==Who is Sandra Herold of the Jungle?==

[[image:Ape_lady_Sandra_Herold.jpg|right|thumb|A face any chimp would love; Sandra Herold.]]

Some people have cats. Some people have pitbulls. Hipsters keep pigs. This woman kept a monkey. It was killer.

Having declined [[anon]]'s advice to install [[buy a dog|dog curtains]], Sandra Herold thought it would be a [[doing it wrong|good idea to keep a wild animal as a pet]].  She resided in the wealthy part of Fairfield County in Stamford, Connecticut. Strangely, she thought pulling a black person out of fucking <strike>[[Africa]]</strike> [[Hollywood]] sounded like a [[fail|clever]] and [[fail|smart]] idea.

Travis did not like Connecticut. Being accustomed to the life of a star, the severe lack of fake boobies, [[hookers and blow]] weighed heavily on Travis and finally lashed out on a friend of Sandra, thus removing her face and hands. Sandra did not have nice boobs.

==The Relationship==

{{quote| [[Beastiality|Travis the chimpanzee's relationship with his owner was closer than those of some married couples.]]|News reporter John Christofferson, commenting on the strange and twisted relationship between Travis and his owner Sandra Herold.}}

Sandra Herold spared no [[Hookers and Blow|luxuries]] in the care and keeping of Travis. She fed him the [[Delicious Cake|finest foods]], gave him [[Jesus Juice|wine]] in long stemmed glasses, and she even took baths with the monkey. Over the course of many years, their relationship grew to that of an older married couple, not that of an owner and pet. 

While this would be confusing to the animal, it is not confusing to humans. She loved the animal like it was a husband, but no animal can understand that sort of emotion, no matter how much a human wants to place human like attributes on an animal. Travis was only seeing a mate, as he had bonded to her like any male chimpanzee would, and that is why when some other person pissed him off by entering his “space” he ate her eyeballs.

===[[Anthropomorphic|Anthropomorphism]]===

{{quote|This is a crazy relationship|Primate Expert and master of the understatement, Stephen Rene Tello.}}

Anthropomorphism is the human tendency to give things human-like qualities. It is considered therapeutic and relaxing by some experts when a human applies these qualities to their pets, but just like most things humans do, these people took it way too far. 

Here are some of the things that Travis’ owner did to provide the [[lulz]]:

*Fed it human food at the dinner table.

*Allowed it to sit in the car as a human would.

*Fed it human drugs for depression and anxiety.

*Preformed fellatio on Travis … lolwut.

*Worried that an animal would have depression and anxiety.

*Gave the chimp ice cream so often that the chimp knew the ice cream truck schedule.

*Took [[bestiality|baths together]]…wait, what?

==The Spin-off==

<!-- You fuckers really need to knock it off with the n-word humor.  It's not funny or clever, it's just really stupid. -->

On February 18th, the ''[[assholes|New York Post]]'' published a [[:image:Travis1.jpg|cartoon]] which portrayed President [[Obama]] as Travis the Chimp. [[Bullshit|The ''New York Post'' has vigorously maintained that the cartoon was in no way racially antagonistic]]. Ergo in less time than an0n could [[Dusty the Cat|avenge a cat]], pissed-off activists throughout the Mid-Atlantic [[successful troll|mobilized]]. 

[[Not]] surprisingly, Al Sharpton - famous for cameoing in Adam Sandler movies and being more popular than Joe Lieberman in the 04' election cycle - was asked to give his take on the situation given his [[sarcasm|expertise and charisma in defusing community racial tensions]]. He has proposed that anyone who ever uses the words "Obama" and "monkey" in the same statement be immediately charged with hate speech.

<center>{{Frame|[[Image:Travis1.jpg]]|color=black}}</center>
<br>

Nobody really cared what Sharpton said, of course.  But the [[media]] treasures him since they're massive [[whore|whores]] for <s>[[lulz]]</s> ratings.

[[Image:Batboy Steals MINI.jpg|center|thumb|After the dust cleared over the chimp cartoon, the media went back to more important matters.]]

Sorry fgts, no shock pics here you [[sick fuck]].

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Charla_Nash_.jpg|thumb|right|Travis turned Charla into [[Juliana Wetmore]].]]
Recently, Charla Nash appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show. We would show you the clip, but it has been [[DMCA]]'d like a million times and we are too lazy to keep changing the link. [[Google|Google it]]. Also 

On or around May 25th of 2010, Sandra Herold died of AIDS (purportedly contracted during her marriage to Travis) at 72 years old. In the end, it was Sandra who had the last laugh: She was being sued for 50 million dollars by Charla Nash, who will now live out the rest of her days not only a faceless deformed abomination, [[You just lost the game|but poor as well.]]
