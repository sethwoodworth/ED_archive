"''Rick James'''" is the name of an [[IRL]] [[hoax]] perpetrated by [[Dave Chappelle]] from February 1, [[1984|1948]] to February 11, 2004. This is considered by many to be the single greatest hoax in history and many people wonder how Dave managed to create a character, release [[music]] under that character's name and do [[shit]] loads of [[drugs]] [[unbirthing|before he was even born]]. The hoax proved that we are all '''"Rick James' Bitch"''' figuratively speaking. 

==Music==

Many people believe that "Rick James" was a songwriter, [[music]]ian and producer. This is despite the fact that for the exception of '''"Super Freak"''' (made famous by [[MC Hammer]]), no one actually knows any of his music. At that point, Rick began to get angry due to the fact that no one really listened to his shit and later beat his girlfriend that he later figured out was 50 Cent's mother. "Rick James" was also the "producer" of Eddie Murphy's single "Party All the Time" and if that isn't [[proof]] of a hoax than I don't know what is.

==Quitting Hoax Forever==

After Dave Chappelle thoroughly [[pwn]]ed the entire universe with his hoax, he decided to do the only honorable thing: kill off the character. This stands in sharp contrast to [[Saturday Night Live]] [[pimp]]ing out every [[funny]] or [[unfunny]] sketch to Hollywood. After one final performance, Rick James was killed off on August 6, 2004.
