'''Le Parkour''', also called Parkour, PK, ''l'art du déplacement'' and free-running, is more commonly known as [[batshit insane]] [[French]] acrobatics. 

According to the Oxford Dictionary of English Language, parkour is defined as: 

'''Parkour''' ''n. (masc.)''
# ''The single action of running away really fucking fast in an urban area, in accordance with the French tradition of running away really fucking fast on the battlefield.''

In addition to being the most popular sport at the moment in France, it is also a source of immense French pride after being featured in an [[American]] movie for almost 90 seconds. Filled with more pride than a bullfrog's throat after being shown in a movie, [[France]] has since made its own movies based on parkour, all of which consist of footage of nothing but Frenchmen running away. However, these movies have been somewhat controversial, as the similiarity of these videos to standard French combat protocol has led to them triggering [[PTSD]] symptoms in thousands of French war veterans.

All who partake of parkour have a [[death]] wish, think they're hot shit or are [[Intellectually disabled|a combination of both]]. Thanks to the [[internets]], many young, impressionable minds are converted to this "discipline" and subsequently make retards of themselves on [[YouTube]] and other video sharing services (e.g. [http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=parkour Google Video]). Although [[common sense]] suggests that repeatedly jumping from dangerous heights and grinding down the cartilage in one's joints might be a bad idea, all but the most [[vanilla]] parkour enthusiasts suffer from one or more [[mental disorders]] that suppress the [[logic]] center of their brains.

== The Purist ==

'''Purists''' are the self-designated Prophets of Parkour. They use parkour for what its meant for: finding a quick path and following it to escape and trying to be UBER [[1337]] and beating everyone else whist still claiming that parkour is not about competition. These people are both very respected and hated within the parkour community. These purists refer to themselves as '''"traceurs"''' and will go to great lengths to distinguish themselves from "freerunners" who do basically the same shit. The act of using Parkour maneuvers to travel from one point to another is known as "smearing" [[feces|parkour]] on that place.

[[Jesus Christ|David Belle]] of Fécamp is the central figure of Parkour, revered by most traceurs as the living incarnation of God.

== The Teenagers ==

The '''Teenagers''' are the kids who do parkour in a pathetic attempt to impress their [[girls|bitches]] n'[[boys|bros]]. They spend hours in the mirror convincing themselves that they're cool, then jump off 4 meter tall buildings and usually end up hurting themselves. They then put it all on  {{youtube|vJNi0q4Pk|YouTube}} accompanied by a [[Cock|hardcore]] soundtrack of [[EXTREME|EXXX-TREME]] [[MUSIC|TUNES]]. 

These kids are [[hated]] within the parkour community for being [[Unwarranted self importance|full of themselves]]. Although they are as much of [[noob]] as you can find without dropping a ten year old boy in an urban environment with a [[Rapist|Catholic]] [[pedophile|priest]] on his [[Ass|tail]], it is surprisingly [[funny]] watching these skater-wannabes blowing out their knees trying to do things the purists can. They will often name their videos something undescriptive yet "elegant" like ''Le Parkour'', as if doing so makes them pros.

== The "Normals" ==

The '''[[Normal]]s''' are people who do parkour as an additional activity in their [[Basement Dweller|already action-packed lives]]. These people vary greatly in [[fail|skill]]. Normal as they are, this group of people is the most diverse in their parkouring. They may do parkour seriously at times but other times use it to generate [[lulz]] for themselves and even the public at large. For example, they might {{youtube|BRGJ_uS9jnY|run around in Santa outfits}} during [[Christmas]] or dress up as [[narutard|ninjas]] and threateningly run and jump around in their respective cities. As a result, it is possible to see a normal parkourfag in his or her natural habitat by regularly watching the [[TV]] show ''[[Cops|COPS]]''.

== The "Mimics" ==

The '''Mimics''' are people who copy the teenagers in an attempt to squeeze some lulz out of these empty husks of teens. Sometimes they succeed and other times they fail profoundly. One such mimic is the Drop38Xtreemist, who mimics the teenager group "drop38".

== Eon's Death ==

On October 19, [[2008]], two [[attention whores|parkour practitioners]] released a [[fake]] YouTube video tribute [[goodnight sweet prince|in memory of]] a traceur falling to his [[pwned|death]] while jumping over shit on a rooftop in an attempt to [[troll]] their local parkour community. The project generated moderate [[lulz]], but gained [[unexpected popularity]] when [[fail|it started being hosted on parkour sites worldwide]]. Soon enough, the video received many comments [[BAWWW|mourning]] Eon's death, and some communities went so far as to start donations in order to [[LOL WUT|plant trees in his name]].

It wasn't long before people found out it was a [[social experiment|hoax]], after which the majority of [[moralfags|parkour-practitioners]] felt [[butthurt|offended]] and [[irony|started making death threats towards Eon]], on the grounds that [[lies|death is not funny]] as well as [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|Karma]].

Shortly afterward, Eon explained his actions through [[shit nobody cares about|a series of well-written posts]], instead of just telling [[I did it for the lulz|the truth]].

[[Retards]] still offer condolences to this very day.

== Around the world ==

Just for the lulz, the [[Portugal|Porkn'cheese]] community of Parkour rulled by, a faggot lover and [[In the ass|anuslicker]] nicknamed, [[Fag|"Zeric"]] , collects the finest fails from their small country and create a movie called "Malhos e Tralhos" which means "falls and falls", just two synonymous words, (which reveals a drastic attempt to gather some lulz from the title, but even in Portuguese, still fails!!!111!!)

PLEASE DO WATCH

In Russian parkour consists of jumping from a roof and running from police. Just like in west, but crazy ruusians jumps from a biit higher places:
