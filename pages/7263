Sauna is a small room or house where [[your mom]] and [[fags]] like to go experience dry or wet heat sessions. Invented [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100]] [[last thursday|last thursdays]] ago.
These sessions are usually [[Secks|social affairs]] in which the participants, disrobe and sit or recline in temperatures typically between '''60°C (140 °F) and 100°C (212 °F)'''.
This of course is banned in public saunas, and usually men and women have separate saunas to prevent sexual contact between them. Which often results in even more [[faggotry]] between males, since there is no [[vagoo]] to stick you [[cock]] into.

Saunas can be divided into three basic styles:
* Traditional saunas that warm the air in the room. This is caused by throwing water on the hot stones at the center of the room.
* Russian style steam sauna, which contains small outlets that release hot steam in the room.
* Infrared sauna that warm objects. Infrared saunas may use various materials in their heating area such as charcoal, active carbon fibers, and other materials.



==History==

The oldest known saunas were pits dug in the ground and primarily used as dwellings in winter. The sauna featured a fireplace where stones were heated to a high temperature. Water was thrown over the hot stones to produce steam and to give a sensation of increased heat. This would raise the apparent temperature so high that people were forced to take their clothes off, which usually led into [[buttsex]] and [[faggotry]]. In a Northern Europe, were a [[Finland|shitty little Christmas village]], where saunas where heated by fucking smoke, these saunas were totally different from traditional saunas in a way that they were heated by heating a pile of rocks by burning large amounts of wood about 6 to 8 hours, and then letting the smoke out before enjoying the heat. This of course is the equivalent of breathing smoke straight from car's exhaust pipe. Despite that, these are still used in present-day Finland by some enthusiasts, but usually only on special occasions such as Christmas, New Year's, Easter, and Midsummer, when these enthusiastic fags are drunk and suicidal

As a result of the industrial revolution, the sauna evolved to use a metal wood stove, with a chimney. Air temperatures averaged around 70–80 °C (160–180 °F) but sometimes exceeded 90 °C (200 °F) (in few occasions excessive heat has killed people in saunas)

The steam and high heat caused bathers to perspire. In northern countries, people also used a device, which is a bundle of birch twigs with fresh leaves, to [[BDSM|gently slap]] the skin and create further stimulation of the pores and cells. Mainly used by fags to spank each other in the heat, before proceeding into [[buttsex]] and [[fellatio|BJ]].

Sauna was also used as a place to cleanse the mind, rejuvenate and refresh the spirit, or some bullshit like that and prepare the dead for burial. The sauna was (and still is) an important part of daily life, and families [[incest|bathed together]] in the home sauna and since the sauna was often the cleanest structure and had water readily available, women also gave birth in the sauna.

'''Sauna Championship'''
[[File:Image6754055gdeath in sauna.jpg|thumb|left|the finalists of the self-torturing contest]]
Sauna world Championship contests were held at late 2010, where Russian wrestler Vladimir Ladyzhenskiy tried to win the title from
reigning champion Timo Kaukonen of Finland.

Nearly 1,000 spectators had gathered in the southern Finnish town of Heinola to watch 130 competitors from 15 countries, to sit in the extreme heat. Torturing themselves and suffering from several burns, while waving flags and cheering on the contestants.
Eventually only two contestants remained in the 200-degree heat and it wasn't long before medical workers pulled the shaking and bleeding men out of the sauna. 

Vladimir Ladyzhenskiy, who was in his 60s, was pronounced dead late Saturday after he collapsed alongside Timo Kaukonen, roughly six minutes into the final round.

'''Death by boiling'''

Somewhere in 2010, two Russian men, decided to jump in the icy cold pool after a long sauna session, but apparently the other one of the men didn't know how to use the cooling device and instead had accidentally overheated the water. and when the men jumped in to the pool, they were instantly boiled alive, resulting much drama and [[I did it for the lulz|lulz]].
