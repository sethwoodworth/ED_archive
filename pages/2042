'''''Dark Age of Camelot''''' is a 2001 [[video game]] set in the [[Before the Internets|Dark Ages]] so that [[lusers]] can ignore their current uselessness by pretending they might have been worth something [[100 years ago]]. The user base is similar to that of other MMORPGS - i.e., fat white people who spend all their money on ''Dungeons & Dragons'' books and ''[[Warhammer|Warhammer]]'' miniatures - but anyone who still plays DAoC at this point is a giant n00b who would be better off with Minesweeper. By far, the most famous member of DAoC community is Olerris, a Jewish potion scamming son of a bitch, who became famous when he "unleashed the fury" on the internet vnboards by thanking everyone for making him 50 platinum pieces, roughly worth 100 bucks, and forcing Mythic to change the rules regarding player housing.

In 2005, the world witnessed the biggest display of [[serious business|nerd rage]] in history, when some guy spent nearly 3 days of his life ([[LOL]], as if he had one) trying to get a rare and powerful pretty-princess cape called a "Cloudsong". Little did he know, a group of people were hanging out near by and decided to loot the item from him when he killed an enemy that dropped it. The audio file of what happened was popularized by some faggot on [[YTMND]] who named the game incorrectly as ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. This caused much confusion and hate among the players of WOW, who are convinced they're better than DAoC players because their retarded elf game is ''newer'' (which actually make DAoC better due to being less of a ripoff. Commence trolling). This coupled with the fact that most current WoW players weren't able to read when DAoC was released, that fact alone pretty much sums it up.

The YTMND:

This became a huge instant-[[meme]], and helped popularize the phrase [[serious business]].
