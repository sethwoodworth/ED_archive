Michigan (Also known as Fridgigan) is Canada's poorest and most highly Nigger populated territory. It's entire population consists of blacks, liberal elitist scumbags, deers, and the lesser known species, [[Redneck|Yoopers]], which is segregated by group into four specific zones. Black zones, White zones, forests, and the [[Finland|Upper Peninsula]]. Michigan's main exports consist of expensive unreliable cars, highly flammable furniture, and [[Your Mom]].

==Zones==

[[Image:MichiganDrive.jpg|thumb|A drive through the Deer Zone.]]
[[Image:Liberaltown fs.jpg|thumb|left|A town in the white zone. Note the lack of black people.]]
The black zones are for the inferior Negroes, and consist of [[Detroit]], Flint, Inkster, and Muskegon. The black zones are poor and rundown, whites never enter the black zone, for fear of their safety and bikes. The White zones are always posh and classy, and consist of Detroit's suburbs and EVERY small town that is not a college town or in the Upper Peninsula. They are inhabited by [[White guilt|Liberal elitists who claim forced diversity and political correctness matter more then freedom.]] It should be noted there are no blacks or other ethnicities in the white zones,  and they even throw money at them to keep them away when the spotlight turns to their town. Little is known about the other two zones other then driving through the deer zone is certain suicide and the Upper Peninsular has some [[WTF|great festive activities in the winter.]]

==Great Lakes==

Once ocean resembling lagoons with Sugar Sand beaches. Michigan's great lakes now serve as little more than oil covered landfills. Michigan is also known for it's [[LOL|rapidly disappearing lighthouses]] and [[butthurt|Super enthusiastic activists]] to save them. They are mainly found [http://michiganlighthouselovers.blogspot.com/2010/07/help-needed-to-save-white-river-light.html here]. Drop by and the let them know how much you look forward to getting rid of the eyesores and building your 116 beech/casino resorts in place of them. 

==Climate==
Summer: Endless humid days, Mosquito and Locus storms common. Makes one wish for winter.

Fall: See winter.

Winter: Freezing days with little to no daylight, power outing ice storms common. Makes one wish for summer.

Spring: See summer. 

==Industry==
Is that a joke?

==Government==
The state Government answers only to the white zones. When the rest are in need of assistance, they simply get the response "LOL Fuck you", and are [[Detroit|left to die.]]

==Pure Michigan==
Sometime [[Last Thursday]], the Government decided it was getting fed up of being PWND by [[Ohio]], and thus spent millions of the taxpayers dollars to launch an advertising campaign for tourism instead of giving it back to local businesses that were driving whatever tourism the state had before. The ads consisted of 30 second commercials with Tim Allen, talking in a voice so monotone not even the most dried out news Anchors could bare it, trying to seek out at least one or two positive things about Michigan. [[FAIL|The campaign was ultimately unsuccessful
in the end, for not even a high paid actor could pick out anything honest that would drive in tourists, if not drive more away.]]
