Jason Steele
Jason Steele is the founder and sole contributor to the website [http://www.filmcow.com FilmCow]. “Wait,” you  stupidly tell this article. “I don’t even know who that asshole is.” [[Image:Jason Steele.jpg|thumb|This is Jason. He's prescribing you a heaping dose of the Filmcow Master Collection, and various opiates.]]

Yeah, [[DAT ASS|that asshole]]. Jason Steele is the writer and animator of the Charlie the Unicorn series, a [[shit]] collection of Flash movies [[16 year-old girls]] get wet over. Though Jason Steele has made several lulzy films since then, Charlie is all he will ever be known for. An  unfortunate side-effect of this [[internet fame]] is that he continues to make Charlie shorts even though each one is worse than the last.


== Relationship with Knox ==

Jason and fellow [[hipster|indie]] filmmaker Knox (real name Robert Benfer)[[Image:Robert Benfer.jpg|thumb|Robert.]] have an ongoing [[homosexual]] relationship that started when the two [[Buttsex|met]] on [[Newgrounds]], back when Knox made somewhat funny claymation movies, before he started making [[retarded]] [[Tim and Eric]] shit. Jason Steele voiced the antagonist, King Womp, in Knox’s first full-length movie, “Klay World: Off the Table!” Knox then voiced Aurek in Jason’s short film “[[Soviet Russia|The Cloak]]". Jason had several parts lined up in films Knox talked about making (and got quite far into making, in the cases of “Joe Cam” and his Chinese Democracy tribute “Villain”) [[Fail|but eventually gave up on]]. Knox has since been featured in none of Jason’s other films, possibly because of this.

== Knoxkast ==

In 2006, Jason and Robert started a [[podcast]] together, “Knoxkast Radio“. The first episode consisted of them trying to read Hamlet and failing miserably before eventually getting bored and abandoning it. This act would set the pace for [[Epic fail|Robert’s career]], but simultaneously introduce Robert’s fans to the then-unknown Jason. [[Lulz|These fans immediately recognized Robert’s comedic superiority and switched over to being FilmCow fans.]] This is why in every episode fan mail is read, half of them[[Image:Matt Books.jpg|thumb|This is Matt. Yes, [[You Gonna Get Raped|you are going to be raped.]]]] end with or consist entirely of “[[Truth|Jason is awesome, Knox sucks!]]”

After the first episode, subsequent ones boiled down to Jason saying something, Knox repeating it as a question, and Jason asking why the show is so terrible. Sometimes Jason had an idea which wouldn’t pan out, like movie reviews. Almost every episode Jason gave an in-depth review of [[Shit nobody cares about|some indie movie nobody gives a shit about]], followed by Knox saying the name of an awful movie he saw that week and “I liked it.”

Knox’s bland delivery of no jokes drove Jason to pursue guests for the show. The long list includes:

[[Attention whore|Matt Books]]: The most prolific of the guests, Matt was featured in roughly a third of the episodes. [[Unwarranted self importance|Everyone (especially Matt) thinks he’s hilarious]], but he couldn’t be farther from it.
[[Fucktard|Sammie]] [[Penis|Penrod]]: Knox’s even more [[retarded]] friend. Does nothing but yell [[Retarded|“HEY-OOHHHH!”]] In later episodes, Knox reveals sad truths about [[Retarded|Sammie]]’s depressing situation, which strongly testifies about his likelihood to commit [[suicide]].
[[Redneck|Patrick Snyder]], aka Evil Knox: Hillbilly friend of [[Fail|Matt]] and Jason. Jason used Patrick to [[Trolling|troll]] [[KKK|KKR]] listeners by [[I see what you did there|pretending Patrick was Robert through an entire episode.]]

[[Mexico|Gian Lanzefame]]:[[Image:Gian Lanzefame.jpg|thumb|Gian [[BAWW|"I'm not from Mexico, I'm from Venezuela!"]] Lanzefame.]] Annoying Mexican with no interest in the show. Was [[Win|trolled to ultimate lulz by Matt and Patrick in Episode 20]] until he [[ragequit]]. [[Some argue]] that until Episode 55, this was the only lulzy thing Matt ever did. Those people would be wrong, as Matt was only playing a part in a skit written by Jason, and technically was being as funny as anyone else could have been.

[[Whore|Meagan]]: Knox’s stupid [[girlfriend]]. Only interesting in the skit episodes.

== Knoxkast Ends ==

In December 2009, Knox and Jason successfully trolled their fans by releasing Episode 75, the final episode of Knoxkast Radio over a year after they said they would, which was coincidentally the worst episode they’d ever done: A half-assed conclusion to their battle against the Twisty Treat empire. They didn’t even bother to edit it before maliciously [[2girls1cup|shitting it into the mouths of 13 year-old boys everywhere.]] Astronomical amounts of butthurt were reached and surpassed.

== DVD ==

In 2009, Jason Released a DVD that compiled several FilmCow shorts on one disc for the low, low, low price of $10. This isn't a bad price when [[Image:Filmcow Master Collection.jpg|thumb]]you consider that Knox's DVDs aren't as well-made and are priced at closer to $20.

== The Present ==

Jason continues to make short films, and as usual they’re hit-or-miss. Sometimes they’re “[[Lulz|Dad Cop 2]]“; sometimes they’re fucking “[[HAI2U|President Taft’s Secret Pony Brigade]]“. He still makes [[Shit|Charlie the Unicorn movies]], and they still [[Fellatio|suck]].
