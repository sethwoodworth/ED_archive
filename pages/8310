[[Powerword|'''Noah Antwiler''']] ''(AKA The Spoony One / Spoony / The Spoony Experiment / That Guy with the early 90's Curtains Haircut/ Self proclaimed king of the internet)'' is another game reviewer among the shitpile of [[Virgin|permavirgins]] that are [[video game reviewers]] on [[That Guy With The Glasses]] and the internet in general.

The possibly bipolar Noah specializes in [[Don't Copy That Floppy|FMV games]] and [[old meme|movie rants]], but unlike the many bully-magnets that try their hand at becoming esteemed game journalists, Spoony was actually [[lie|funny]] at one point in time (heavy emphasis on "''was''"), when he wasn't doing [[crossovers]] with [[That Guy With The Glasses|legions upon legions of basement-dwelling failures]] on the internet. [[Noone|For those that may be skeptical]], many of his videos up to Phantasmagoria 2 were at least watchable. By these calculations, this would mean that Spoony hasn't produced funny since, yes, [[Facepalm|the summer of 2008]].

Ever since [[you|someone]] introduced him to the concept of [[boring|vlogs]], he has long since abandoned doing videos with quality content and effort, and started doing [[TL;DW|40 minute videos]] of him [[Nerd Rage|ranting endlessly]] about [[Shit Nobody Cares About|some movie or how shitty wrestling has gotten]]. While expressing your thoughts in a long video is extremely commonplace for self-important asswipes, it becomes alarming when 90% of said "content" are these [[Ted Stevens|wastes of precious tubes]]. The only people who listen to this shit are [[Nobody|his most diehard of fans]], and even then, they put it on as background noise while they fap to [[porn]].  He's reached a point in his "career" where he spends a week or two (or four) between real "updates", occasionally shitting out a half-hour video of him sitting in front of a camera and [[Lazy|posting old "archive" videos to other websites]], despite the fact that they are readily available on his own site. More frequently, he posts other people's videos in lieu of a proper update. 

Even though he does not produce a regularly satisfying quality of work, <s>Mister</s> King Antwiler has become quite butthurt regarding the art of [[constructive criticism]], not even toward his shittier, more half-assed work. He's even gone so far to dedicate videos and, on some occasions, had a few knee-jerk comments in others implying that: [[Unwarranted Self Importance|"You can't complain about free entertainment."]] Ironic for someone who's tried to get his meager e-fame to [[Unrealistic Expectations|pay the bills]] for him.

[[Image:Gblow_02.gif|thumb|A scene from Spoony and [[Armake21]]'s collaboration video.]]
[[File:spoony1990.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Noah Antwiler in 1990.]] 
Inspired by the [[Shit|"Hilarious"]] video reviews of [[Armake21]] (why the fuck Noah chose a slap-head guido as his [http://blip.tv/file/2164614 inspiration] we'll never know!) and the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]],  The début of Spoony on the [[internets]] was extremely forgettable in terms of notability.  

Noah Antwiler got his start in January of 2007 with a review of The Adventures of Bayou Billy for the [[NES]]. Over time, thanks to his [[Unfunny|sharp wit]] and [[MST3K|nerdy humor]], Spoony rose through the ranks of popularity quickly, becoming [[Do i have potential|someone who had the potential to make it big on YouTube]].

His most notable of these works was a series of reviews on the overrated disaster known as [[Final Fantasy|Final Fantasy VIII]]. The reviews merely stated the obvious, but it can be best described as simple, yet effective trolling against the legions upon legions of mouth-breathing nerds known as the Final Fantasy fanbase. Biting the obvious bait, the fanboys [[RAEG|raeged]] into pure [[butthurt]]; they continually make [[shit|clever]] remarks about Spoony such as him being a [[basement dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[v/|v/irgin]]... and that's about it.

It was decent lulz for all who witnessed the sheer butthurt of the fanboys in person, but the adulation by [[Everyone|those that despised the series]] were pure overkill. In fact, one [[newfag]] on this very site posted a [[blowjob|kiss-ass]] summary of Spoony in [[Video_Game_Reviewers/List_of_Reviewers|a certain article]] because he thought his trolling was the greatest thing since [[mudkips]]. Thus led Spoony to believe he was [[Aspierations|one of the few individuals that was praised by this site]].

Spoony eventually managed to subside on the donations his reviews generated, and thus when he was laid off from his job around Halloween 2008, he decided not to seek a new one. At the time of this writing, Spoony have been officially [[unemployed]] for almost 2 years and counting, which will probably do wonders for his ability to get work once his Internet boat of money sinks and he finds out that most (if not all) employers will not accept "Internet Superstar" as valid part of a resume.

Since he [[Prostitution|owes TGWTG money]] after getting a new server it is unlikely to see videos not featuring the disease-ridden faces of [[Linkara]], [[Tgwtg#Benzaie|Benzaie]], [[Tgwtg#Lee_Is_Still_Gaming|Lee]], or any of the other Z-list internet celebrities on the site.  His relationship with these other reviewers is a lot like that of a remora attaching itself to a torpedo.  His sedentary lifestyle has led to health problems more in line with that fucking tallow-bag [[That_Guy_With_The_Glasses#HopeWithinChaos|Sean Fausz]].  Then again you know how it is, when one person has a heart attack all the sudden you do too.

Any review featuring them will invariably result in grown men dressing up and acting silly. '''LOL COMEDY!'''

== Spoony's "Family" ==

Noah currently lives in a deserted wasteland that is [[Arizona]]. After coming to the conclusion at age 28 that being a [[basement dweller]] in your parents' house and mooching on their steady salary could be potentially be bad for his Internet career, (living under the risk of having your computer privileges taken away at any moment is pretty stressful, y'know), he decided to be a basement dweller at his brother's house and mooch on his steady salary instead.

Noah is also in a relationship with Scarlett, some [[ginger]] [[bitch]], who [[pussy-whipped|pays for and operates his site in exchange for the freedom to use his rectum for drilling purposes]], and making sure that she [[fat|is supplied with a steady stream of]] [[delicious caek]] (yes, Spoony is so utterly whipped that, it is, in fact, HIM who is [[in the kitchen]]). The only way he can get close to heterosexual contact with another woman is to fake it, as evidenced [http://www.thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thedudette/specials/7073-spspoony here].

=== Scarlett Topia (Girlfriend) ===
[[Image:Scarlett.jpg|185px|thumb|left|When he's not BAWWWing to his fans,  he's being anally raped by this fat ginger <s>pig</s> That's just cruel. She's clearly more of a [[Mr. Hands|horse.]]]]
[[Image:Scarletbanhammer.png|400px|thumb|right|It is a [[lol wut]] moment. If Pope spoony does not get the endorsement, we are going to excommunicate them from the internet.]]
[[File:SaclettNSpoony.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Alternate "Fat Girl Shot",<br>hide as much of yourself as you can behind someone else closer to the camera in perspective.]]
[[Image:ScarlettTopiahambone.jpg|185px|thumb|left|What she actually looks like without Photoshop.]]
[[Image:Scarlettgroupshot.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A rare shot of the ham beast in person.]]

[[Some argue]] that behind every failure there is a [[woman]]. And indeed, many points towards Scarlett ([[Power word|real name]] Jessica Miller, in some circles also known as "Ginger Yoko") for being the one who:

* Pussy-whipped Spoony
* Was the real reason why Dr. Insano was created, which turned out to be the first symptom of Spoony's humor <s>turning stale and dry</s> withering and dying.
* Was responsible for turning his forums into a [[Nazi|fascist]], banhappy, dicksucking place, meaning that is currently little more than an echo chamber which only serves to enable spoony's fastly growing ego.
* Only ever uses the one [[Fat_girl_angle|carefully posed]] photo of herself and never appears on any video.   [[Fat#Secret_Fatty|I WONDER WHY?]]

So has [[love]] ultimately turned what could have been [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|a promising Internet career]] into complete shit? We let [[you]] decide. [[Truth|But the answer is yes.]]

According to the ginger bitch herself, she and Spoony met the same day he lost his job. In the beginning she only helped Spoony build his website, but she was soon promoted to moderator and eventually admin on his forum, and she has since then only confirmed the old [[truth]] that women should never be put in the position of holding any kind of power whatsoever, as they are generally stupid, controlled by their emotions, and can't use [[logic]] to save their life. When Scarlett is not clumsily flirting like a [[drunk|frisky]] [[whore|girl]] with the basement dwellers on the forums or [[Trying Too Hard|making bad sex jokes]], she is busy making sure that nobody criticizes Mr. Antwiler, ever. Whenever some brave soul actually does exactly that, no matter if it comes in form of "lol, u sux over 9000 dicks!1!!" or "You raised some good points, but there ''are'' a couple things you could have explained better...", she will immediately ban the perpetrator, make a [[hypocrisy]]-filled, self-righteous [[tl;dr]] post about "[[tolerance]] and being nice" and lock the thread. This has given Spoony the impression that this is the mature and correct way to handle criticism, and probably why he today rages like a rabid chimpanzee every time some of it actually manages to come through to him.

And don't [[newfag|naïvely assume]] that criticism is the only basis for threadlocking or being [[b&]].  It has been proven that if you were to gather all the various forum guidelines (which are spread about stickies posted in several different locations over the forums), copy & paste them into a text document, then print the document, it would take up [[over 9,000]] pages of text, a list to which Scarlett is always adding whatever shit happens to come to mind and [[Spaghettios|rain down from her vagina]]. 

Criteria for moderation include:

* having a signature that exceeds an arbitrary length
* making any sort of reference anything in the real world that requires more than two neurons to process and therefore beyond Scarlett & Spoony's combined ability to comprehend (i.e., anything other than shitty movies, videogames, and wrestling), such as news items, politics, and religion
* discussing the site's ads or complaining that they're NSFW
** as though watching a 45-minute video of a [[basement dweller|man]] rambling on about his impressions of ''The Expendables'' does qualify as SFW, but anyway [[tl;dr]] version: [[rules of the internet|DO NOT FUCKING TALK ABOUT THE ADS]]
* really whatever random reason a mod happens to pull out of their ass, however unrelated the reason to any of the stated rules

* And what ever you do,  no matter how tempting or lulzy it is.  Never, '''EVER''' mention this [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] page.  [[B&|INSTABAN!!!]]

As a result, it is believed that she is responsible for locking every thread ever made.

Scarlett tries (and fails) to ride her bitch's coattails with her [[GOTIS|GOTIS-infested]] [http://scarlettopia.com/ blog], which is so terrible it's not even funny. The entire thing is written in horrible purple prose, and filled with spirituality meta-crap to show how intelligent and [[deep thinker|deep]] she is. Meanwhile, most of her post titles are bad puns on movie titles and her [http://scarlettopia.com/about/ about information] lists some of the most banal, [[mainstream]] shit imaginable, while at the same time desperately screaming, "HEY SUP DUDES, I'M A GIRL BRO, I LIKE COOL ASS CULT MOVIES LIKE MONTY PYTHON, AREN'T I AWESOME?" And of course her fanbase (by which we mean, Spoony's fanbase) laps it up.

{{Quote|And as I grow ever more worldly and wise over time, I have much less patience for the tired story lines...| [http://scarlettopia.com/sustenance-spirituality-soul/ Oh Scarlett.] How about that one storyline with the ban-happy [[moderator]], or that one about the [[Video Game Reviewer| Game reviewer]] with the bad case of [[USI|unwarranted self importance?]]}}

=== Miles Antwiler (Brother) ===

[[File:Miles Antwiler.jpg|thumb|left|Miles Antwiler]]

Miles Antwiler is a tragic soul who is the brother of Spoony and the owner of the house where Noah is currently wasting away his existence. While he is (understandably) very rarely seen in the flesh,  Spoony cannot get through five minutes of a video without mentioning the guy at least thrice. However, when he ''is'' present in one of Spoony's videos, he typically keeps a cool head and can be seen rolling his eyes when Spoony goes on one of his bitch fits. Although Spoony usually refuses to let Miles share his opinion on camera since it's his show and he constantly cuts off the poor bastard. Whenever that happens you can sense the [[U_mad|antipathy]] for Miles as he puts up with Spoony.

While Miles may be considered somewhat of a lesser known character in ''The Spoony Experiment'' universe,  he does deserve a humanitarian award for his sheer persistence of living with Noah's massive ego and temper tantrums for so many years.  Though it would be instantly removed as he didn't do the world the decent thing and beat the egotistical fuck to death with the nearest blunt object at birth. This extends to the present, since Miles is a [[Police|cop]] and could easily get away with it. Also he seems to have the paitence of several thousand saints, as Spoony bitch-fits by '''screaming''' on his vlogs at roughly 3AM and routinely dons silly-arse coustumes, yells like a [[Manchild|manic manchild bitch]], and uses an entire room as a "studio". Miles either spends alot of time at the local bar, or just [[facepalm|facepalming]].
{{clear}}

== Spoony's "Creations" ==
As is the case with many [[internet celebrities]] who outstay their 15 minutes of fame, they usually fall into many habits that are common of [[That Guy With The Glasses|people with a severe lack of wit or creativity]]. Though Spoony's excessive reliance on such can also be traced to his affiliation with TGWTG as an attempt to fit in with his family of circle jerking compatriots. One such habit is relying on horrendous sketch bits and introducing "new" [[Shit|wacky]] characters in [[trying too hard|a vain and often unsuccessful attempt]] to keep their material from getting stale and prevent themselves from becoming yesterday's news and thus have to give up being [[e-famous]]. As Mr. Antwiler has a [[lie|true dedication to quality and original content]], he has created many [[Original Character|new characters]] like Hulk Spoagan, Ultimate Warrior Spoony, Spoon'Tock of the Klingon Empire, Terl and Spoondalf the Grey in record time - none of which were actually good, nor are those listed below.

=== Doctor Insano ===
[[File:Doctor Insano.JPG|thumb|left|Doctor Insano,<br>AKA Spoony's [[Sonichu]]]]
[[File:Jhgfkujyfv.jpg|thumb|right|ORIGINAL CHARACTER,<br>DO NOT STEAL!!!<br>Whoops,  Too late!]]
Dr. Insano is Spoony's go-to character for many of his sketches that he shoehorns into his reviews. Running on humor that even a 5th grader would cringe at, Dr. Insano's shtick usually involves him popping up and laughing like a [[Retard|maniacal madman]] then dragging the joke out too long while he overacts and dramatically yells the word "[[Science|SCIENCE]]!" whenever it is mentioned.

Shortly after creating it, due to how successful Spoony ''thought'' the character was, and due to him not having a job at the time and desperate to make his [[e-fame]] pay his bills, he came up with the brilliant idea/pipedream that Doctor Insano would be [[No|great for TV]]! Wanting to get a spot on Mythbusters which even fellow manchild [[Adam Savage]] would no doubt find laughable, or to get Doctor Insano his very own children's show where he teaches kids about mad science and how to be incredibly [[unfunny]].

Insano usually appears on screen whenever Noah can't get [[TGWTG#Linkara|Linkara]] or one of his other TGWTG fuck-buddies to cameo on his review/rant/eBegging drive at short notice and normally involves him prancing around the screen like a faggot in a high-pitched girly voice (again, like a faggot) all whilst being incredibly irritating, boring and pointless (again, like Spoony). It really should've stayed a one-off gag, not a recurring character.  Unfortunately, he'd already invested in those novelty glasses, so he was determined to make it work.  He hasn't and it doesn't, but his determination should count for something.  It also doesn't.

Doctor Insano is also responsible for the hundreds of Cosplaying-fags as of late dressing up as him at conventions, as his costume consisting of a green t-shirt, white overalls, a stethoscope and a pair of dollar googly glasses can easily be afforded by the poorest of [[You|basement dwellers]]. 

Plus, come on, Insano is totally a Doktor Sleepless ripoff.  Spoony's always tickling the BALLS of Warren Ellis on the fucking Twitter.

=== Spencer D. Bum ===

[[File:SpencerDUnoriginalCharacter.jpg|thumb|left|Spencer D. Bum]]
[[File:ChesterCSpoonyrippsoff.jpg|thumb|right|Chester A. Bum,<br>You can see where this is going now?]]
[[File:SpoonyLovesTheBum.jpg|thumb|right|Spoony, thanking Chester for inspiring him.]]
Spencer D. Bum is conclusive evidence that Spoony's talent of creating original, funny characters has no bounds.  ''No, Wait.  It's just a shitty rip off of the Nostalgia Critic's Chester A. Bum.''  

Unfortunately yes, as high a pedestal his ass kissing fanboys love to place him for his banterous, witty videos.  He's still like the rest of the TGWTG circle jerk, by ripping off Channel Awesome's cash cow. Though to give him some credit, instead of just going by "that guy with..." type creations,  he's instead adopted a character of Doug's noone gives a fuck about.

Anyhow,  While Spencer D. Bum, isn't as well known, or as used as his other creations. <s>He is still brought out of the closet occasionally to make fun of the [[Irony|unemployed and destitute]].</s> Spoony actually realized that this "creation" was unpopular amongst his fanbase and, in a rare moment of mercy, killed it off, which instantly made his videos 0,0002% less annoying. Just a shame that it was too little, too late, and will likely never happen again, especially not to [[Sarcasm|beloved and well-developed]] characters, like Doctor Insano.

=== The Gate <s>Keeper</s> Cleaner ===
[[File:The_Gate_Keeper.jpg|thumb|left|The Gate Cleaner]]
[[File:Gatekeeper nightmare.jpg|thumb|right|The Gatekeeper]]

Just put a towel on your head, wear a black shirt, and dim the lighting. Presto! You've got a retarded clone of a character from the classic board game [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare_%28Atmosfear_series%29 Nightmare]. Don't worry because others from TGWTG will find this [[Fagolescence|hilarious]] and do their own versions.

{{clear}}

=== Black Lantern Spoony ===
[[File:BlackLanternSpoonyShit.jpg|thumb|left|Black Lantern Spoony]]
Oh, fuck off.  It's just Spoony in a "Black Lantern" t-shirt.   

And we just bitched about Spencer D. Bum being totally void of creativity. Even further proving Spoony has lost all creativity, Black Lantern Spoony is Spoony's "attempt" at giving his reviews a storyline (Jesus fuck), much in lieu of Linkara, even [[Sex|intertwining]] him with [[Twilight|Linkara's storyline.]] In the "storyline", [[TL;DR|Black Lantern Spoony is actually the real Spoony, but got killed by Squall. Linkara made a clone of Spoony to run the Spoony's show but the original come back to life thanks to Mecha-kara and]] [[Truth|Jesus Christ this is fucking stupid.]]

{{clear}}

=== Emperor Spoonius Maximus ===
[[File:Emperor_Spoonius_Maximus.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Spoonius Maximus, Here's hoping he's killed by his own consul.]]

Spoony wasn't invited to the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9JYq-mXprw Delta Tau Chi Toga Party], but that's not gonna stop him from using this costume. Pretending to be a failed Shakespearean actor, Spoonius throws his weight around on shitty opinions nobody cares about. He even ruins [[TGWTG#The_Cinema_Snob|Cinema Snob's]] 100th review by creating an unfunny running gag with his TGWTG circle jerk crew that viewers fast forward through.

{{clear}}

=== General Katana ===

[[File:Spoonygeneralkatana.jpg|thumb|left|General Katana?]]
[[File:Generalkatana.jpg|thumb|right|What General Katana actually should look like.]]

Not only is this another stolen character, but it's down right the worst costume Spoony wore. Seriously look at this fucking thing. It looks absolutely nothing like General Katana. The biggest travesty is that Spoony didn't even make this costume and credits The Game Heroes for donating it. Let's hope 8-Bit Mickey was fucking with Spoony and lied that it was a legitimate costume.

{{clear}}

=== Terl ===
[[File:Terlspoony.jpg|thumb|left|Doug's shitty characters aren't going to work any better for you, Spoony.]]
To be fair, Spoony can only be held partially responsible for [[stealing|creating]] this character. He originally used this character as a cameo in [[Doug Walker]]'s review of [[Battlefield Earth]], but it has since been adopted into his own reviews. As you can probably guess, Terl is a character from the source material, so [[OMG|he's completely unoriginal]]. Terl combines Doug's [[clueless]]ness with Spoony's [[lazy|laziness]] to create something that fails twice as hard as what either of them normally produces.

{{clear}}

=== Squall ===
[[File:Spoony-Squall.jpg|thumb|left|Squall]]
[[File:Emo Squall Fag.jpg|thumb|right|Uncanny resemblance between the two emofags.]]
It's about this part of the article we see that Spoony has finally veered into the [[Chris-chan]] world of creativity.  A land where copyright is for faggots and if you make it,  you own it.  No matter if someone else created it before you.

It turns out that in spite of hating [[Final Fantasy VIII]] to the extent of recording several hours of Let's Play in which he expresses his utter disgust of the game, Spoony owns '''''an entire Squall Lionheart outfit, complete with gunblade and necklace emblem'''''. Squall was a throwaway gag throughout his [[Final Fantasy VIII]] Let's Play, a series so devoid of lulz by the end, he had resorted to cosplaying to make with the funnies.  Didn't work,  but you [[lie|can't blame him for trying]].

{{clear}}

=== Tidus ===
[[File:Spoonytidus.jpg|thumb|left|Tidus]]
[[File:Tidus FFX.jpg|thumb|right|Yet another uncanny resemblance between the two emofags.]]

Oh my fucking God, Spoony! Do you have any [[No|common sense]]? [[Facepalm|Wasting money and time on cosplaying existing characters to do some shitty skit contradicts any negative feelings you have for that game]]. Now you look like an even bigger fag for trying to get some one paragraph summary about the game across to the internet. Even your fucking lame excuse to not throw $100 on a replica of Tidus' sword is laughable, especially considering how much use you made out of your Squall gunblade after your FF8 review.

It's sad to think that this is Spoony's idea of [[trolls trolling trolls|trolling the "haters"]], because if it is, [[doing it wrong|Spoony really hasn't a fucking clue]].

{{clear}}

=== Chuckles The Fucking Jester(WTF!?) ===
[[File:Spoonychuckles.jpg|thumb|left|Chuckles The Fucking Jester]]

Chuckles is yet another example of Spoony's lack of creativity and effort, a character <s>taken</s> stolen from the Ultima series. You just feel embarrassed looking at this. Even for him... Spoony decided to use this character in order to completely shit on his fan base. Not the fan base who posts 24/7 on his forums and blindly agree with everything he says, because they're 12 and have no real responsibilities (like Spoony). This is towards the fan base that originally supported Spoony, before he became the self indulgent whore he is today. A fan base who may even be contributing to this very site. Spoony makes satire about creative criticism towards his reviews while bringing up [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yJtTJMPBJI painful memories he had to endure.] Good thing Spoony doesn't take shit from anyone [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/fbv/bmbe/28098-filmbrain-hudson-hawk (unless its a whore off crossover video)] or he might actually learn to organize himself along with his workload and stop lying to everyone about what he's doing.

Spoony also had to force his brother Miles to wear part of the costume and smack him in the head with a rubber chicken. That must have been the most fun Miles had with his brother in a long time. Scarlett is also credited for doing the makeup on this costume. Best guess is that Spoony can't look into any mirror without it shattering on contact from his sheer ugliness.

Actually, Spoony said that it was Scarlett who smacked him with the rubber chicken. This further confirms that Spoony is totally whipped, and whatever trace of masculinity and individuality he once had has been put in time-out in favour of [[Ginger]] [[fat|Porky's]] [[rape|influence]].

== Spoony & The Mashables ==

[[File:Spoony ring small.jpeg|185px|thumb|left|SpoonyOne's usual reaction to any negativity on his website.]]
[[Image:Spoonywalloftext.png|185px|thumb|right|DON'T FUCK WITH NOAH ANTWILER!]]

In 2009 he muscled out all the other nerds and won the Mashable Web Awards "Funniest Person to Follow"-title, viewers were expecting some kind of celebratory speech from Noah where he expresses his gratitude upon recieval of his useless internet accolade. What they got, however, was a two-page written [[Waaaambulance|rant]], lashing out at his fans for not liking his [[circle-jerk|crossover collaborations]] with his clique of butt-buddies at TGWTG, blaming all the viewers for the butthurt the criticism has caused among his neckbeard Blistered Thumbs pals, and telling his fans to "just fucking leave my site if they don't like it". Apparently his acceptance speech got trolled by fans of the other contestants and he took it down and then flipped the fuck out on EVERYBODY. [[HA_HA_HA,_OH_WOW|Ha Ha, Oh Wow]], talk about moodswings! For a guy whose claim to fame is trolling [[Final Fantasy]] fanboys he sure has some [[Sensitive|frail nerves]].

===Spoony Tries Again===

In 2010, King Spoony was once again going for the Mashable "Funniest Person to Follow" award. Apparently he was aware that a fair portion of his fanbase had [[banned|mysteriously disappeared]], because he was resorting to the time-honoured tactic of [[cheat|ballot stuffing]] in between complaining about how ill he is. In the end, he lost to some [[Korean]] [[Faggots|pop boy band, named "Super Junior"]], and he didn't even get a measly honorable mentioning, *sniff*. Spoony has not yet reacted to this loss, but he will undoubtedly find some way to blame what little remains of his fanbase for failing to hand him a new e-penis enlargement.

So, remember when Spoony started his pointless crossover spree, throughout 2009? When you couldn't swing your dick whithout bumping into pieces of shit like Lee, Linkara, Benzaie or Angry Joe ruining videos left and right? Well, it turns out people didn't like it as much as Mr. Antwiler wanted them to... A thread on his forum quickly grew to 3 pages, filled with outcries like this.

'''The Offense:'''

{{Quote|Let me try to explain this best I can, I enjoy Spoony One's videos but it seems like ever since early this year (and I'm talking about the main reviews here) he's had a crossover appearence with someone from TGWTG and while I can understand why he does that (being a part of the site and all) it's got to the point where I think he's just milking it.

To be honest I'm getting a bit sick of it and it does not help the fact that nearly every video on TGWTG is like that nowadays and has put me off it (then again my strong desire to be part of that site I guess partly explain this)

Maybe I'm a bit crazy over this, but it just bugs me and I've noticed it bugs other people as well|A forum poster,  showing exeptional courtesy.}}

'''The Response'''

{{Quote|If they're not happy, they can leave.|Spoony, caring about his fanbase as usual.}}


And so the thread was locked, and the more vocal dissidents banned. What a douche, amirite?


{{Quote|Waa, Spoony's being mean and angry again, and he's banning people. And he took my lolly. It's my site, ban-meat. I'll do the fuck I want.|Spoony (via Twitter),  The Beginning of the end.}}

When his Maze & Monsters review featured a [[shit|fan cover]] version of the theme song, some members of his fan base committed the horrible crime of not liking it 100%, and actually dared up coming with (shock and horror!) [[constructive criticism]]!

{{Quote|Terrible. The pacing is way off and the original Break me is quite melodical. This one had the same level of sound thruout. Its fine as a one off like an 8bit remix. Otherwise its just dull and not unique in its sound at all.}}

{{Quote|Yeah. Plus it's rather depressive as opposed to the upbeat 'aw yeah, shits about to happen' feel of the previous opening. The band itself sounds fine, but this song didn't work with my prior concept of TSE content.}}

Of course these reasonable presented and completely valid reasons for not liking it, was all it took for <s>Mr.</s> King Antwiler's frail nerves to snap like [[Chris-chan]]'s [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Fctcvictory1.jpg crooked dick], and he instantly flew off the fucking handle:

{{Quote|To all the trolls out there on my forum and website, this is not the time to fucking test me. I will hatefuck you with my banhammer.|Thus spoke Spoony}}

And this was only the beginning. Judging from his borderline [[insane]] [http://twitter.com/TheSpoonyOne twitterings], Spoony is currently still on a rage rampage through his forums, swinging his banhammer indiscriminately left and right in order to weed out those Judases in his midst who dared being slightly unhappy.

Spoony is defining irony with his tweets, at different times whining about corporate abuse of power, claiming he is justified in his own [[Delete Fucking Everything|abuse of power]], whining about trolls, calling his own fans whiny for complaining about his rampage, whining about [[funny|mistreatment]] of [[women]] in Africa, and continuing a joke about the WTC from one of his videos.

{{Quote|Honestly, I'm glad I'm pissing so many people off lately. Means I'm doing my job. I tell it like it is. I'm in your way. Get used to it.(...) Honestly, one of the joys I get out of life is in banning whiny, ass-wounded punktards. Keep it up.|Spoony, truly a father to his fans}}

[[File:SpoonyOneInternetProfessional.jpg|thumb|left|185px| He's just as "professional" as [[Chris_Bores |Chris Bores]] or [[Arch_Fiend |TheArchfiend.]]]]

During the charity drive hosted by TGWTG in December 2010 Spoony was asked a question by one of his many fans through Skype. Before having the opportunity to do this he had to donate at least $300 in order to ask a retarded question. He asked why Spoony wouldn't play Final Fantasy 9 and questioned his personal views about the game exposing how much of a hack he is. Showing his true professionalism as a internet celebrity/journalist/reviewer/shitheel Spoony grows impatient with the fan and tells him off. After doing so his circle jerk crew plays cleanup and kicks him off. The instant this event took place Jerry Lewis dropped to his knees and wept for the future of humanity despite all of his efforts to save them.

===Paranoia===

[http://thebusystreet.com/2010/10/01/someones-a-little-paranoid/ Busy street's account was banned recently,] despite not making a single post on the site. This means one of two things: Scarlett(Or Noah) is personally checking criticism about them on the web (just like [[David Miscavige|another fan favourite]]!), or that Spoony's moderators have become so paranoid about being watched that they have actually started banning people [[Lulz|for doing nothing.]] As time went on it [http://thebusystreet.com/2010/12/04/spoony-is-hiding-in-fear/ the situation has further escalated] into the deep paranoia that Spoony is facing of his fans turning against him.

==Spoony gets Sick==

{{Quote|You know, people can be snarky about a lot of things, but to be sarcastic about someone's poor health is low.|That's right, Only Spoony has exclusive rights to wish ill on people.}}

{{Quote|Felt so poorly today I went to the emergency room. Tests showed nothing so I guess I just have to wait.|Potentially a very bad case of [[faking it|Plumbum Oscilluns.]]}}

Since the Second of October, Spoony's twitter has been dominated by claims of a mysterious illness that [[tgwtg#Lee_is_Still_Gaming|prevents him from making videos.]] No doubt the ER docs advised Antwiler to exercise more often than he does on his current once-per-year regimen (i.e. when Doug Walker has him running and [[Buttsecks|play-fighting]] about in the course of filming annual [[That Guy With The Glasses|Channel Awesome]] site anniversary specials), to diversify his junk food-based diet, and to shower once in a blue moon, and it should come as no surprise when Spoony promptly ignores this advice, seeing as [[Lie|the journalistic demands upon him are of vital social importance]].  But don't worry, Spoony has soldiered through it just enough to nominate himself for the Mashable web award repeatedly! God bless you, Spoony. We know you'll pull through just in time to make another [[TL;DR]] post about how much your fans suck.

Though updates in his pointless vLogs we learn that Spoony is consuming heavy amounts of caffeine and fast food against his doctor's orders. What we learn is that this is giving him severe pain and headaches. However Spoony rests the blame into the very medicine he's taking to prevent it. I'm sure he got a second opinion from Dr. Insano and plans on killing himself as he goes to a [http://spoonyexperiment.com/2010/12/08/spoony-gang-go-to-white-castle/ White Castle.] We're expecting this fucking retard to die before Sean Fausz at this rate.

===Update===
In [http://spoonyexperiment.com/2010/11/06/vlog-11-6-10-health-update-more-dd-unboxing/ a video] posted [[Last Thursday]], Antwiler explains that due to [[Hambeast|a peculiar medical condition]] (which those less versed in the medical sciences would <s>in</s>correctly characterize as the natural result of poor diet and never exercising), the simple acts of walking and carrying light weights pose significant risks to Antwiler's health, while aerobic exercise '''may well cause his heart to stop'''.  Look for him to be wheelchair-bound in the next Channel Awesome anniversary video.

== Merchandise ==

In order to become a true whore on the internet you must create as much merchandise as possible. Merchandise that consists of quotes from your own show that can be slapped on anything [http://www.cafepress.com/ cafepress] throws your way. Spoony loves to go out of his way to make said items his retarded fan base would be willing throw their parent's money at. Don't worry if you don't know of their existence. Spoony will make sure you see them in almost every video he makes. You can find many copyright shirts that Spoony sells without permission. Spoony will peddle his fellow circle jerk crew's shit if given the chance. He'll even take fan art and sell it without the artist getting a cut. Why pay them when they should be thankful for the privilege of Spoony liking their work. 

Best of all you can buy his autograph for only 5 dollars (plus 2 dollars for shipping). Spoony himself wastes a couple of seconds to put his signature on one of his many whore infused images. Some images that are just bad photoshops that would cause a serious lawsuit. Still we advise to purchase one today. Better make sure you store that photo next to your favorite Hollywood actor and sports figure memorabilia because that will go for more than everything sold at [http://www.juliensauctions.com/auctions/2009/michael-jackson/index.html Michael Jackson's auction.] The people at Kinkos who printed these must have gave Noah so much shit when he tried to explain who he was. "No really I'm an internet celebrity." "Yeah whatever you fucking faggot. That will be $360 plus another $200 for cutting them to size."

To fill in the long process of watching other people's Let's Play videos to turn into reviews, Spoony decided to make a contest in September 2010. This contest would be about people fighting a field of grass similar to the Ultima series. He was expecting many lulz worthy videos to be sent to him for the chance to win an autographed photo of Spoony. The end result showcases possibly the worst submissions in the history of the internet. 146 shitty videos were created and Spoony himself claimed there weren't any bad entries among them. Now you the reader can be the judge of that.

The ones that Spoony deemed worthy were re-uploaded on his blip.tv account with a pointless intro starring him in order to rake in the ad revenue. Fans called out to this instead of linking the respected creators, but Scarlett quickly shut down any criticism towards her little pookie bear. After all it is expensive to print a picture of yourself and use ink to write down your signature. Maybe Spoony can beg his fans for a $2,000 Cintiq monitor and a new copy of Adobe Creative Suite so he can sign it and digitally email it to the winner.

His unsatiable ego has even spread to his own work.

Sorry, I mentioned how every other aspect of your game sucked, I just forgot to talk about how the dodging, stamina, and parry systems suck, too.

This argument amuses the hell out of me. “Yes, our game is crap, but for $10, what did you expect? It’s like ordering Cup O’ Noodles and expecting something edible.” And I’m delusional for expecting entertainment out of my $10. So sorry, Spike, I’ll remember what you consider to be $10 of entertainment next time you release a game.

== Failed Television Show ==

I'll decide what goes on the fucking front page, and when.|Spoony|defending this shitty excuse for a fan pacifier}}

Once upon a time, a meek submissive IT jockey Josh Hadley, and his Something Awful Goon neckbeard friend got together to create a show that reviewed old sci-fi films with banter so awkward and forced that an evening talking about your latest sexual encounter with your parents might be a better way to spend your time. For some odd reason, a local television station, Green Bay TV, decided to air their show.

However, their parade of mediocre shit was missing something; an Internet personality even shittier than they were at commentary to bash these movies (wait, wasn't that the neckbeard?). So they contacted Spoony to play the part of the cynical shit pile (role of a lifetime!). They managed to create 11 episodes using Spoony's idiotic Dr. Insano and Leslie Striker persona. 

Unfortunately, due to censorship issues (the idiots forgot they were on TV in the middle of their awkward commentary) and the fact that the local TV station was utterly surprised by how shitty the show they made was, they were canceled before they even aired.

Like a mature adult, Josh Hadley threw a temper tantrum, calling the station's employees fascist nazis, and uploading his show to the internet (despite the many copyright and contract infringments that would entail).  And Spoony, like a good dick sucker, hosts the embedded video on his site.

So now, for the next half of a year, expect his site to be filled with shitty sci-fi movies, shitty commentary about them, and of course, more vlogs. And don't even think about critiquing the show on Spoony's forums - like every other piece of criticism, his mods are [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|deleting every negative comment]] by order of The Spoony One himself and handing out bans like [[pedobear|candy]]. Hopefully his nuts will drop and he'll stop hosting the videos on his front page, but we all know that's not likely to happen.


== Wrestle! Wrestle! ==

Since vlogs wherein Spoony rambles about some movie or some game he played for an hour proved to not be quite boring enough, he increasingly turned to rambling about [[Wrestling]] for an hour. In August 2010 he started a [http://wrestlewrestle.com/ new site] dedicated entirely to endless complaints about burly men fondling each other. One can only assume that this amount of boring faggotry isn't even palatable to his most hardcore fanboys anymore, so he's now out to scrape even beyond the bottom of the barrel in search of a whole new stratum of morons. Of course, without putting in any sort of creativity apart from stating that [[Captain Obvious|wrestling is terrible]]. FOR AN HOUR. Guess someone's gotta pay for these [[gay porn|PPVs]] and it's not going to be Mr Antwiler.

If you want to sample exactly how devoid of any kind of excitement this is, look no further than the opening of this "show", which has to be the most laziest effort in the history of internet reviewers. You definitely don't want to watch a whole episode to confirm that this is the case for the entirety of it.

<center>'''A summary of every video Spoony makes about Wrestling.'''</center>


== Maffew vs. Spoony ==

The following is an extract from a livestream where Maffew, creator of some wrestling show blooper called "Botchamania", manages to get the drop on Spoony. Apparently Maffew had been criticizing Spoony repeatedly, and therefore LordKat decided to let in him on his livestream one night while Spoony and AngryJoe were present, resulting in the bit below.

<center><youtube>KL3HJtYK5Ho</youtube></center>

This humiliation prompted Spoony to spit out these posts on twitter: 

* "I love watching the crybaby's in Lordkat's stream whine about what a meanie I am. Sorry I didn't like your shitty movie. Want a lolly?"
* "Now heel turning on Lordkat's stream" 
* "DAMN YOU MAFFEW! YOU BEEN DUCKIN' ME FOR TOO LONG! I'M COMIN' FO YOU N***A!"
* "I WILL PUT MAFFEW IN A VEGETATIVE STATE. THERE WILL BE A BLUDGEONING."
* "I PUT HIM IN DE CAMEL CLUTCH AND MAKE HIM HHAMBUL AND FAKK HIS ASS."

Chances are that these ramblings could just an attempt to emulate some of the usual [[Gay|playful]], [[retard|boasting]] gibberish wrestlers spew out to hype their [[buttsecks|fights]]. <s>But this is questionable judging from Spoony's recent fits of rage.</s><br>

It's been later confirmed by Maffew that this shit was fake and they love to touch dicks.

== Spoony Vandalizes Wikipedia ==
[[File:SpoonyVandalizesWiki.jpg|thumb|none|400px|centre|Maybe he should spend less time on Wikipedia, and more time finding a real job.]]

In a desperate vie for more popularity, Spoony takes it on himself to edit himself into as many Wikipedia articles as he can, starting with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander:_The_Source The Highlander: Source]. However, despite the wikipedos deeming Spoony notable enough for his own article, they state that doesn't mean his reviews are.

Lol.

{{quote|Noah Antwiler of The Spoony Experiment had this to say about Highlander: The Source. "The Source is dogshit. I mean weapons-grade dogshit. If your dog shat something this nasty, you’d have it put down and buried in a Hefty bag. I wasn’t even ready for something this bad. If you thought The Quickening was the low-point of the series, well, I don’t even know anymore. This movie punched me in the nuts and stole my lunch. I’m still a little dizzy from that one. If it’s not worse than Highlander 2, it’s right up there. I mean, second-place by a razor-thin margin. I think the only reason The Source isn’t as notorious as Highlander 2 is because nobody saw it (it was direct-to-video) and expectations for the series were already rock-bottom. I don’t want to say too much but if ever a movie shot its way to the top of my review stack, it was this one." This short commentary on The Source came days after Antwiler did a two-part video review of Highlander II: The Quickening.|Self edit by Spoony, AKA IP:91.104.25.187,<br>Considered [[Non-notable]] by [[TOW]].}}

There's very little that can be done to cure Spoony of his raging [[butthurt]] at the moment, so keep trolling. He's rapidly becoming [[USI|that guy who posts a response to each and every one of his critics, mocking their stupidity.]] He's only a few steps away from declaring himself our Lord and Saviour on the internet. We can probably blame [[TGWTG]] for this, since it has exposed him to a world where criticism does not exist and even the shittiest work is unanimously praised, and he wishes the fans on HIS site were half as stupid and brain dead.

It ultimately comes down on a mildly promising reviewer pulling a [[Star Wars|George Lucas]]. Overreliance on fancy effects? Creation of kooky side-characters? Complete inability to handle criticism? It's all there. All under the pretense of being a critic.

I think we can consider the Spoony Experiment officially dead, though the fanboys (unless Spoony banhammers them) will keep the carcass afloat for years to come.
