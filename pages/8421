'''Tim Kretschmer''' (November 6, 1991 – March 11, 2009) was a 17-year-old graduate of the Albertville-Realschule in [[Irony|Winnenden]], [[Germany]] who committed a mass murder of fifteen people ([[Asking for it|eleven were women]]) and wounded nine others, including two policemen, all for the good old [[lulz]]. His shooting rampage has been dubbed as the '''Winnenden [[School Shooting]]'''. Kretschmer committed [[suicide]] after being cornered and wounded by police officers. 

The press helpfully pointed out that Kretschmer was playing a lot of [[Counter-Strike]], and we all know [[Jack Thompson|what that does to people]]. He also was an avid [[Bulletball]] player and had [[unrealistic expectations|planned on becoming a professional player.]]

Kretschmer was a [[Geek|loner]] and had no friends, he lived in his basement wanking over [[Anime]]. Pretty much like [[you]], except he [[Fact|really was an exceptional shooter]]. However at least we expect that you'd have the courtesy to write an article on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] before you did it so we'd have the exclusive.

BTW, little Tim [[fail|was rejected]] by the actual [[Nazi]] army, because he was [[So cash|too wacky]] for the '''Wehrmacht'''.

==Krautchan trolling win==

The German police and world [[media]] were [[Win|successfully]] [[trolled]] by someone on [[Krautchan]] pretending to be Kretschmer who apparently posted hours before the shooting.

'''Translation:''' ''Damn it Anonymous, this is getting to me. I'm fed up with this shitty life. Always the same - Everybody laughs at me, nobody recognizes my [[basement dweller|potential]]. I'm serious Anonymous. I have weapons here and tomorrow morning I'll go to my former school and have a great time [[An Hero|barbecuing]]. Maybe I will even get away. Keep your ears open Anons. You will hear from me tomorrow. Just remember the name of the location: Winnenden. [[Breda Highschool Massacre|'''And now, don't report this to the police, don't be scared, I'm just trolling XD''''']]

Rech later admitted that the post was a hoax, saying "[[irony|Some crazy person]] apparently decided to pass around this awful fake message."

Somebody else crafted this masterpiece and put it on 4chan:

== JawsPredator1 ==

He allegedly traveled the internets as ''JawsPredator1'' and had an account at the German video portal ''video.gmx.net'', on which he was flamed posthumously until the host decided to delete his account - [http://74.125.77.132/search?q=cache:2TPCXqjvH8oJ:video.gmx.net/news.php%3Frubrik%3Dgodgh%26searchMember%3D4625534+JawsPredator1&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk see the hate in google cache]

Some tough guys however decided to use his profile page to announce their evil plans:

:AndreasMarcus1992 14.03.2009, 11:43 Uhr 
:Du hast das richtige getan Tim!! Aber cih werde dich überbieten und alle verfickten Menschen von meiner Schule abknallen -.- Und da im moment eh 100 von solchen drohungen kommen wird die polizei kaum ernst nehmen wenn noch eine drohung kommt... ich danke dir für die aktion.. aber mein lauf wird mit abstand der beste den die welt gesehen hat!

Translation: 

:AndreasMarcus1992 14.03.2009, 11:43 Uhr 
:You did the right thing, Tim!! But I will outperform you and [[delete fucking everything|kill all fucking people at my school]] -.- And since hundreds of these threats are coming anyways, the police will hardly take another one seriously... I thank you for your action.. but my run will be the best the world has ever seen!

the drama continues...

==An Heroes Comparison: Kretschmer vs. McLendon==

The day before Kretschmer enacted [[IRL]] [[Counter-Strike]], [[Redneck|Alabaman]] Michael McLendon went on a slightly less impressive spree in which he murdered eleven people (including [[An_hero|himself]]) in a fit of Darwinian justice. While these two incidents are similar, their respective merits necessitate comparison for the sake of determining who obtained more [[EPoints|points]].

'''Kretschmer:'''

*Killed five more individuals; wounded nine others (whether or not any of his victims were [[Turks]] - who aren't really people and are therefore worth fewer points - is not widely known)
*Got Bonus for shooting eleven girls.
*Was a crack shot, regardless of Germany's far more restrictive gun laws
*Shot two cops after taking a bullet in each leg
*Functioned as a fully serviceable killing machine despite numerous handicaps ([[13-year-old_boy|teenager]], [[Faggot|whiner]], [[German]])

'''McLendon:'''

*Killed his fucking [[Your_Mom|mom]], grandmother, uncle, [[Incest|niece and cousin]], thus truncating his family tree quite severely
*Burned down his mom's house
*[[Pwn|Pwnt]] an 18-month-old girl
*Opened fire on [[Wal-Mart]] and [[The_War_of_Northern_Aggression|Piggly Wiggly]] retailers

Whichever of these two garnered more points depends entirely on criteria implemented in calculating scores, but this much is certain: [[Butthurt|neither did it for the lulz]] or topped [[Cho]]'s high score.

==Trolling from beyond the grave==


Kretschmer has verified his position as an true hero by causing a huge [[Orgasm|debate]] over a possible [[ban]] of violent [[Tetris|video games]]. On the 5th of June, the [[Nazis|Secretaries For State Security of all 16 Länder]] proposed a ban on all "... games in which [[pwned|murder]], [[BDSM|torture]] or other [[B|inhumane]] acts of [[rape|violence]] against [[White People|humans]] or [[Furries|human-like beings]] are an important gameplay element..." - i.e. any game ever made except for [[Furcadia]]. [[Gamers]] all around Germany were [[RAGE|outraged]], proving that Kretschmer was not only an hero but is also an undead [[troll]], continuing his work even after his [[necrophilia|death]]. Resistance is not expected, as it is unlikely that the [[Basement Dweller|German gaming community]] will stop [[Masturbation|masturbating]], get up off their chairs and [[ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH|fight the good fight]].
