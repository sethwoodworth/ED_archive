Radu Privantu (born 10/11/1982) is a [[bestilolity]]-Rights activist and game destroyer.

== Biography ==

Radu Privantu was born in  in the great Vial Depression of 1982, to parents Adam and Steve Privantu.

[[Shota|At the age of 12]] Radu was accepted into St. Bwians College for the [[Fag|Gender Confused]] where he majored in [[Computer Science III|Software Development]] and Being Molested By His Mathematics Teacher. Upon graduation he hooked up with long time friend Leonard Nimoy (see [[faggotry]]) whom he went on tour with in 1990, and acted as backup in his performances and as sub in his [[BDSM|dungeon]]. One [[Shit nobody cares about|achievement of interest]] was his backup in Mr. Nimoy's song "A Ballad of Bilbo Baggins". Radu later stated that he was not originally intended to sing so high but [[masturbate|he couldn't let go of his balls]] throughout the performance.

After a speculum related breakup with Nimoy, Radu went solo, where he recorded albums such as [[WTF|"They call it an al'''bum''' for a reas'''bum'''"]] and [[DO NOT WANT|"Whats with all the foreskins?"]]. While not being nominated for any awards of any sort, the song "[[Bible|Sodom and Gomorrah]] plus [[hookers and blow|Viagra and Tequila]]" was rumored to have been awarded an honorary "What the fuck was that?!" by [[American Idol]] judge and fucktard Simon Cowell.

At the age of 24 Radu started development on Eternal Lands, a game which for a short time he was hailed as [[an hero]] for.

Mr. T was noted as saying "We're very pleased with Mr. Privantu, it takes a lot to write the source code for a game with one hand!"

However, the fame was short-lived. Very soon Radu became [[Bureaucratic fuck|mad with power]] and employed the services of slaves called 'Developers' (ie; not the Leonard Nimoy -> Radu Privantu kind of slaves) to write the source code with two hands, while he [[Unwarranted self-importance|claimed to be God]] and demanded that the filthy plebians of the Eternal Lands pay him tribute through [[PayPal]] to avert his [[butthurt|wrath]], which was poured out full strength onto the plebians in the form of No Eating Day's and Increased Grief Days.

In 2006 he stated that the "fucking plebs" had not paid him enough tribute and, being unable to afford a [[Fleshlight]], threatened to unleash hordes of bunnies, beavers and Arctic Chimeras onto the inhabitants of Eternal Lands, unless they appeased him.

Having failed to do so, he [[Internet tough guy|pledged that he would continue the punishments]], but warn them if they could amass a tribute of Hydrogenium Bars to present to him as a sacrifice. Upon completion Radu announced the Danger of Invasion Center of Knowledge (or [[dick|D.I.C.K]]) that would warn people when an [[i/|invasion]] was about to occur, but not do anything else.

== [[Controversy]] ==

A little-known fact about Radu Privantu is that he holds the world record for wearing a [[butt plug]] for the longest peried of time. He wore the plug for a total of three years (in fact, precisely the amount of time between the original release of EL and the 1.32 update. The butt plug was removed for a short time after the release of 1.32 (have you ever seen [[Tubgirl]]?) but was reinserted after a short time. This fact has stirred controversy among the gaming community, as developers do not know whether to call him an [[asshole]] or a [[homosexual]].

It has often been suggested that Radu should release the fucking source code for the server so that the developers can host a clone and make the fucking thing work right since he has practically [[buttsecks|sodomized]] the entire thing. Too bad. It was a good game. Learner should own it, not this Assclown. Pay your fucking developers, dick cheese!

Nobody has disagreed, but several people have noted that Radu would be a bloody skid mark.

Another controversial fact, briefly mentioned above, is that he insists that he is God. [[Some argue]] that he is the Antichrist, but several prominent members of the [[Christian|Catholic Church]] have stated that they are certain that the Antichrist would probably prefer to give, whereas Radu prefers to [[in the ass|take]]. He has made previous statements that he has managed to [[Goatse|insert an entire watermelon into his rectum]].
