Sharron Angle
'''Sharron Angle''' was an unsuccessful [[Tea Party]] [[Republican]] candidate for U.S. Senate for the State of [[Nevada]], running against [[Harry Reid]] in the November 2010 elections.  However, [[Carl Paladino|like most Tea Partiers]], they leave their sanity at home.

Angle believes that the [[government]] [[conspiracy|conspired]] to [[taint]] the water supply with [[Cum|Fluoride]]. Clearly, she [[lie|cares]] about the [[Dr. Strangelove|purity of our most precious bodily fluids]].

Angle also is in favour of outlawing [[beer]] due to her [[God Hates Fags|Southern Baptist]] roots.

Angle was in favour of implementing a [[Scientology]]-based program for [[criminals]] to rehabilitate themselves by giving them [[blowjobs|massages and footrubs]] called Criminon.[http://www.holysmoke.org/cos/sharron-angle-nevada-sec-state.htm] Angle was on board with this plan until she joined the Tea Party and decided to vote against the proposal she was for because it would cost [[money]].  Not the ridiculous amount the Scilons would have asked for, but the spending of ANY money, because her [[Jews|Tea Party overlords]] refused to spend money on anything that involves any social programs (e.g. paving roads, paying police officers and fire fighters) unless it is a pet project.

Had she won the Senate election in November, her loyalty to the Scilons to establish the Criminon program would certainly had been renewed.

[[Anonymous]] learned of her involvement with Scientology and [http://forums.whyweprotest.net/15-media/las-vegas-tribune-endorses-scientology-tool-sharron-angle-us-senate-race-67383/ did not approve].

Angle has proven [http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/may/26/angle-campaign-working-quiet-scientology-question/ she is more Scientologist than Southern Baptist] in recent weeks by not taking any press interviews, intimidating local media outlets, and upholding a pro-Scientology agenda in her campaign such as abolishing [[Social Security]] and healthcare benefits.  Critics have argued that she also has no need to spur job development in Nevada which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country now that Sigfried and Roy have retired.
