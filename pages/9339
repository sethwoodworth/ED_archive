'''Zb''', also known as ''angryskul'' and ''notso'' (a humorous take on his former IRC handle, brightmn) works on [[FreeBSD]] both as a kernel hacker and as a consistent instigator of internal developer [[drama]].  Previously lived in the [[San Francisco]] Bay Area spending his free time terrorizing its citizens with his motorcycle and frequenting various hospitals. Recently retreated to [[New York]] to correct the shortage of [[Jews]]. Currently using his talents to mathematically facilitate [[internet]] <strike>dating</strike> stalking amongst [[16 year old girl]] [[camwhores]] and the [[fatties]] that love them. <strike>Can be found on [[idlenet]]</strike> most often in sfrivethead and [[insub]]. Has a long history of wanting to suck cocks in [[BSDcode]], making [[Goth]] girls cry, and teaming up with SKUL to destroy bad [[C]] and [[Perl]] code.

== Lifetime Failure Award Recipient ==

He once [[Quitting IRC forever|quit irc forever]] to the sheer delight of [[Bantown]], as he had not completed a single mission and was [[gay]] with [[Tosh]]. ([[Tosh]] is also gay with [[User:jbs|jbs]].) Upset, he accused everyone who did not laugh at his lack of [[funny]] as being in cahoots with [[RBK]], because it must surely be the doings of that evil slut and not his own downward spiral since birth. He is the leader of the [[MySpace]] [[bantown]] group despite not being in bantown, bantown not existing anymore, noone in bantown being on MySpace and the group not having any other members. The only lulzy thing that he has ever done was to port [[gay.pl]] to FreeBSD, which wasn't actually very funny in itself.

angryskul's dad is totally in Mossad.
