This [[Retarded|exceptional]] meme hails from the land of backwards letters and [[over 9000]] nuclear missiles.  [[Communists|Russians]] spend time posting variations of him when they're not [[South Ossetia|spreading freedom]] or [[Warez|enriching the digital landscape]].

== What is it? ==

Who fucking cares.  Inquiring minds in search of an answer on [[2ch.ru]] wind up distracted by [[Child porn|delicious cake]] so we might never know.  Perhaps that is its ultimate purpose, a beacon of light on a dark ocean.


The name of the man on the pictures is Vladimir 'Nomad' Goryachev. He works in company [http://www.ag.ru AG.RU] as a game reviewer and a journalist. His reviews are full of deep nihilism, pessimism and sometimes disgust. Actually, Russian word ХУИТА stands for any meanless and useless shit, so Nomad+ХУИТА is a very good combination.

When you see this man in reply to your post or comment, I have some bad news fo you: you should really become [[An Hero]], 'cause you've just said [[Stupid|a very stupid thing]] or created the worst thread ever.

== Seriously, WTF? ==
[[Image:Xynta.PNG|right|thumb|In after XYNTA hija-- oh, nevermind]]

Little vocabulary.
Russian [xʊj], "хуй" is especially rude world, that means "dick". Khuyta (pronounced like "who-it-ah", desu) is just a transliteration of a Russian derivative word that means "bullshit". Some [[newfag|newfags]] try to force this "meme" on 4chan or just wipe it. In Soviet Russia, meme forces you.
