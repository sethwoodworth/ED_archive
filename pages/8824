'''VoicEverything''', or Travis and his [[nice guy|beta male]] follower Matt, are a couple of [[YouTube]] [[trolls]] and [[attention whores]] who recently drew the attention of [[Anonymous]] with their video "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i4ScDTg1no '''voicEverything Attacks Anonymous and Encyclopedia Dramatica''']".  The video was a troll engineered to appear as a rant from two indignant and oblivious wannabe "news" reporters who basically regurgitated [[Fox News]] talking points gleaned from the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNO6G4ApJQY infamous Fox News report].

== The All-Important Aftermath ==
[[Some argue|As many speculated]] their video and subsequent slander of Anonymous was just a pathetic troll attempt and days later this was confirmed in their [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEfgatRMO1k follow up video] wherein they claimed to have [[I did it for the lulz|done it for the lulz]].  <br>
In the follow-up they stated the following: 
<BR>
*'''"VoicEverything"''' was intended as a news-oriented show they've been trying to get off the ground for months but couldn't get any views.   
*They attempted to [[trolls remorse|apologize]] to [[ED]] and [[Anon]] for their troll.  
*That they had chosen the [[Drama-generating_techniques|controversial]] nature of their approach purely to [[attention whore|get hits and buzz]]. 
<center><big>'''The "Bottom Line"'''</big></center>
They claimed to have done it "[[I did it for the lulz|for the lulz]]," but they openly admitted in the same follow-up video that their ulterior motive was purely to '''[[Shameless self promotion|attract attention]]''' and '''[[Attention whore|make a name for themselves]]''' in their attempt to gain notability on Youtube.   
Thus, 5 days after their initial video was posted (Dec. 16th) they had revealed it to be merely a ruse to gain subs and views, proving what most [[Anon]] had initially concluded - that they were simply 2 desperate morons who would do anything for [[E-fame]]... a trait common to most [[YouTube]]rs. <BR>
Travis and Matt's whereabouts are currently unknown. They recently closed their YouTube account, partly as a result of the excessive counter-trolling they suffered, but mostly from the realization that [[no one]] gave a shit about their web-based "show."  Wherever they are or whatever they're doing it most likely includes more [[shameless self promotion]] and other [[YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG|misguided]] attempts to hit it big on teh [[internets]].

== Trivia ==
[[Image:Voiceeverytthing Matt and Travis buttsecks.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Travis showing Matt his "bottom line"]]
*[[Some argue|Some believe]] that, in fact, they only claimed they were trolling in their follow up video to mask their immense initial failures and save face.  [[Shit nobody cares about|This is still unconfirmed]]. 
*Just like FOX news, these two are incorrectly citing sources.  There is no ED page on African Americans, or this bleep bullshit.  There is a page on [[niggers]], though.
*Are fighting [[lol wut|false lies]], which are "just not American."
*Do not believe [[Jews Did WTC]].
*"Retarded" is perfectly [[irony|appropriate]] for describing things you don't like.
*[[USA|"American"]] is a word that stands for all that is [[W|good]].
