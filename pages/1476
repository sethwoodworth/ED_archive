What makes the [[internet]] [[rage]] more than [[Kenny Glenn|a teenager throwing his cat around]]? When that cat happens to be a kitten and the teenager happens to be both a crazy cunt and a black person. To make things worse, this time kitty had already used 8 lives. Remember, unlike [[Jews]], [[cats]] don't belong [[Holocaust|in the oven]].

[[Some Argue|The story goes]] that she broke into her former flatmate's house with an accomplice in order to to [[troll|play an elaborate practical joke]] on them. This practical joke included, but was not limited to, throwing bleach on the wall, slashing furniture, and just being a general [[Latarian Milton|hood bitch]] around the place. Of course, it progressed to toasting Tiger Lilly into what she intended to be a [[Chinese|light, crispy dinner]].

==The Search for [[Dox]]==
===Researchers triangulate her possible lolcation===
[[Image:CheyenneCraigslist.png|left|thumb|Cheyenne is looking for work.]]
[[Image:CheyenneFlyer.png|right|thumb|NYC pass this out around her neighborhood for the lulz.]]
Ignoring accusations by many denizens of /b/ of moralfaggotry, the [[basement dwellers|coldhearted citizens]] of [[B|/b/]] come across this crazy cunt on June 5th 2009. Unlike [[Kenny_Glenn|previous examples of online animal abuse]] there was much confusion around trying to find her [[dox]]. All they had to go on was that she was black and lives in the Bronx. No wonder they were completely lost.

The original address given by ohlawd.com was discredited almost immediately due to being in Brooklyn, not the Bronx. Though this didn't stop many nubs spamming this as the address in threads, a few more cunning /b/rothers went to work on a set of photographs taken from the top of a high-rise, in a set from her MySpace.

[[Image:L_5ab930ec3fc4493c929ea77b27ccdae8.jpg|450px]]

The picture showed a train line beside some sort of public school looking building with some courts outside it. By combing the Bronx in Google Maps, one [[I_am_Legend|legendary]] anon found the building, on the corner of Westchester and Tinton. 

[[Image:1244238567793.jpg|450px]]

After some debate, it was decided the most likely building of the two candidates was the one beside the "720" number along Westchester Ave. However, as this was the building she was likely living in when the incident occurred, [[Party_van|pizzas and mail packaging deliveries]] had to wait.

===Court Date Documents & Assorted Bullshit===
[[Image:Ccherry2.jpg|thumb|Defense information and arrest record.]]
[[Image:Ccherry1.jpg|thumb|Listing of charges involved in this one case.]]
When contacted via [[AIM]] her ex-husband/boyfriend left this "Away" message:

{{quote|I like 2 know if there's a chemical imbalance in ur make up sum times I wonder if u plan half of this shit b4 I wake up calling my ex-girl or e-mailing my mama ur tha only 1 causing me this drama n then expect favors wen u come in town n I noe if I c u gararente its going down cuz 2 stay with this girl u couldent pay me I RESPECT a women but this bitch is crazy this bitch is ccrrraazzyy this bitch is cccrazzzzyyy.|Donp0008}}

It seems like they are willing to slide further down the evolutionary scale and [[lie|claim she is mentally disturbed]].

UPDATE - Under the agreement, Cherry pleaded guilty to two charges in a six-count indictment. She waived her right to appeal and agreed not to keep a pet for the next three years. Cherry, jailed on a probation violation, appeared for formal sentencing July 31, where the sentencing was further postponed to september 2nd.  This is probably because new york law states "jew a cat, get jewwed", and the judge needs more time to figure out where to procure some [[Zyklon B|zyklon /b/]].

===Oops!===
Because of the [[how do i shot web|mass confusion]] surrounding her contact details, a few unintended victims were added to the trolling list:

{{quote|In a cruel twist to the case, a Brooklyn retiree who shares a last name with Cherry is getting threats after someone mistakenly listed her number on a Web posting about the cat slaying. 
"They're all saying, 'You'll burn in hell,' 'Who the hell do you think you are?'" Bernadette Cherry, 72, said of the 75 calls from cat lovers.|NY Daily News}}

spedwitmeds (10:30:21 PM): The only way they would remotely leave you alone is to give informaton on where to find the girl we're looking for.
spedwitmeds (10:30:41 PM): Then, retroactively, they would go after her and forget about you, because it would be pointless.
spedwitmeds (10:30:51 PM): DOn't you have any information for them to go on?

{{quote|OH NO SHE DID'NT.|/b/'s reaction to first class faggotry.}}

==Conclusion==
Judge Byrne gave Cherry only a year in jail under a plea bargain, which of course left moralfags frothing with hate and with vows to kill Cheyenne. Although the sentence was pretty light for burning a cat in an oven like one would do to a Jew, it should be taken into consideration that everyone was spreading her address and phone number all over the internet for everyone to see. Although her family changed numbers, they were'nt able to move out of their ghetto home on 680 Tinton Ave. because they're niggers, so be prepared to hear of revenge from [[Terrorists|radical moralfags]].

Edit:  Nevermind.  As of 12/3/09 the nigger's getting [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/12/03/2009-12-03_bx_teen_gets_2_years_for_roasting_cat_in_oven.html two years in the slammer].

===When Trolls Collide===
Just before she was locked away [http://media.causes.com/512752 Cheyenne Cherry mocked animal rights groups by taking full credit for burning the cat], causing PETAfags and [[vegans]] everywhere to [[lulz|collectively shit themselves in horror]]. [[Some argue|They say]] two [[fails]] do not make a [[win]] - but we will let [[you]] decide.
