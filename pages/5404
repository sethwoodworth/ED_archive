{{quote|I think Mind of Mencia is a pretty cool guy. eh steals jokes and doesnt afraid of anything|[[Pretty cool guy|A cooler guy than you.]]}}
A [[racist]] [[Comedy Central]] show that pretends not to be racist by putting a [[retarded]] half-Honduran, half-German poseur. The general thinking is that Carlos Mencia (who was brought in to serve as a replacement for [[Dave Chappelle]] because Comedy Central completely failed to see the difference between Chappelle's Show and racism) steals jokes from other, better comedians and apparently thinks it's hilarious to yell "beaner" and "wetback" every five seconds (even though he's not even [[Mexican]]), but he can't be racist, because only [[white people]] are racist. However, none of that matters, because the show is EXTREMELY [[unfunny]]. Watching this show can be likened to the feeling of cutting off your [[cock]] with a [[woman|nail file]].  His typical jokes involve racism, while Mencia says it's not racist, then insults the audience, calling them stupid for not laughing because they "don't get it" or are "too big of pussies to laugh".  Additionally, he likes to yell about freedom of speech, yet he (and his equally retarded fans) can't take criticism of any kind. In retrospect, he barely even tells jokes. He just says "deet de de" for half an hour

The show would be better if it didn't have the host wearing shirts showing his stomach and dressing in drag all the time. Not by much, though.

The show has officially been canceled.  [[And nothing of value was lost.]]

==Carlos Mencia==
For starters, Carlos Mencia isn't even his own name. It's '''Ned Holness'''
And on top of that, he's not even Mexican (as stated above.) He's actually half-German (father's side) and half-black person (Pretty south of Mexico, actually. Almost into South America.) The fact he was born in Honduras doesn't mean anything, seeing as his own parents didn't want him (even they knew he sucked) and gave him to his aunt right at the moment he was born.  His aunt lives in [[Los Angeles]], California.

Basically, he's like the [[Barack Obama|half-white black kid]] that tries to be gangsta, even though he lives in a suburban neighborhood with other white people, but only if you replace gangsta with beaner, and half black with "half just kind of tan and not really a minority."

==The Origin of Carlos Mencia==
The persona of Carlos Mencia was hatched from an egg (like all minorities) in the back alleys of [[Los Angeles|Southern California]].  Southern Cali, known for its gang violence and abundance of angry spics, encouraged a half-Honduran "Carlos" to become a [[racist]] by proving that all racist [[stereotypes]] are true. Carlos was beaten by local gangs throughout most of his life, earning his nickname, "[[Michael Moore|Fat Fuck]]."

Due to his [[rape|upbringing]], Mencia internalized ([[food|ate]]) the rage of the entire [[Mexican]] race, and set out to kill [[Whitey]], but he'd also internalized all the laziness, and chose "comedy" as a low-impact alternative. He takes his anger out on [[The Man]] by pretending to tell jokes on stage when he's really just repeating obscenities.

Eventually, [[Comedy Central]] decided they needed another [[unfunny]] show to replace shows like ''[[Drawn Together]]'' and its biggest moneymaker, [[Dave Chappelle|''Chappelle's Show'']]. ''Mind of Mencia'' has lasted more than 1 season because it appeals to today's youth's interest in [[spics|minorities]], [[retards]], AND [[fat people]].

== Objectifying Midgets ==

Carlos is also known for objectifying midgets, as shown on his show.  This slavery he puts them through includes, sneaking into other comedians houses and stealing their <strike>underwear</strike> jokes, working in his [[fudgepacker|chocolate]] factory and watching The O.C..  Since Mencia is an Arab, he cannot be punished by the United States Government for reinstating slavery or be killed by conventional weapons.

Yet, whenever anyone accuses me of being a joke thief, I crawl right back into my thick motherfucking insecure shell, and call myself "The punisher!"

== The Forums ==

You think Mencia is pathetic? Wait until you meet his fans. It's ironic that Mencia complains about stupid people, since his fan base is comprised entirely of them.  These people think that Mencia is a comic genius and spend their time worshiping his every move in his shitty BBS forum. There also many butthurt rants about Joe Rogan (Half of the threads in the section dedicated to Mencia himself are about Joe Rogan!)

== Stolen Jokes ==
In a video made by Joe Rogan, he comes up on stage while Mencia is going through his normal "DEET DEE DEE! BEANER WETBACK NIGGER CRACKER GAY GUY! DEET DEE DEE!" routine when Rogan pwns him and proves all his jokes are stolen.  Carlos was so scared people might discover his "secret", when people uploaded it to Youtube, he cried to Youtube to remove the video.

Mencia never says anything about this on his show, because, as most people don't know, [[Maddox|after the show, Rogan did a sneak attack and raped Mencia. Right before climax, he said, "Bitch, if you ever mention anything about this on your show, I'll call INS on you and stick my big black cock up your ass before they ship your ass to Mexico, so you can see how real Mexicans live."]]

After standing up for the rights of others like a good American, Rogan was banned from The Comedy Store, and dropped from his Hollywood agency, Gersh.  It is no accident that Mencia, who was also a client of Gersh, was instrumental in getting Rogan thrown out of there.  In support of Joe, other name comics left the agency in protest of Mencia's [[nazi|backstabbing shit]].  (Rogan has mentioned this situation in radio interviews, and his blog at joerogan.net)  

At the present time, Mencia is still a practicing [[commie|Communist]], and a [[nazi|half-German bastard]] stool pigeon for the Jew. He can be seen playing shitty indian casinos in flyover states.

== Samples of Thievery ==
To be duly noted is that all the "original versions" are funnier anyway.
