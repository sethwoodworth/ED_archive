==Just The Facts==

#Ralph is an adorable little green goblin dude with a brewski and a pipe, who spends his days quietly watching the denizens of ''[[Second Life]]'' have pretend sex.
#Ralph started from a thread on Luelinks by the [[LUE#LUELinks:_A_new_hope|LUEser]] Potty Time, who continues to troll the game to this very day. However, his pictures were later re-posted by NUEser faggots on [[4chan|/v/]], who attempted to claim him as their own. 
#Ralph has quickly gained popularity among many trolls, with some of his pictures even making it to the number 1 spot on Reddit. 
#Ralph is probably the first example of the decade of original content being driven into the ground by unfunny newfags.
