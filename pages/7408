[[Image:KAWAIMECHASAMA.jpg|right|thumb|Shadowgamers?]]

[[User:Shadowgamers|Shadowgamers]] is a [[batshit insane]], [[Mechanophilia|mechanophiliac]], [[sick fuck]], [[drama llama]] and wannabe [[troll]] who is owner to over 100 sockpuppet accounts on DeviantART (most of which are banned). Shadowgamers is renowned for trying to be [[sarcasm|funny]] and [[failed]] in every attempt whilst unbanned.<br> He also beats his [[ALL CAPS|caplock button]] longer than he beats his [[penis|limp dick]] in a day. He was apparently also the most popular troll on the [[Complaints Forum]] of DeviantART whilst unbanned aswell.

= ShadowGamers in a nutshell =

[[Image:Lol wait a second.png|thumb|right|Proof of Shadowgamers' faggotry]]

Wherever there is a complaint topic in the DeviantART forums, ShadowGamers either hacked it to death with [[ALL CAPS]], or hijacked it with his un-commandable legion of fans. If not, he was getting to it. 

==== Examples of ShadowGamers in the complaints ====

== Humping avatars ==

Once upon a time, ShadowGamers managed to start his own shitty avatar [[fad]]. This shit didn't go down well with Tartlets apparently... <br>

As you can see, none of these people have lives or girlfriends.   

==Lolly is a pretty cool guy, RealitySquared Hates Shadowgamers' Guts==
[[Image:Lolly_is_a_pretty_cool_guy.jpg|thumb|right|Lolly lays down the law]]

So after about 9 or 10 months after being banned for the Gooby incident, Lolly decided he'd go ahead and contact Shadowgamers, laying out some probation rules for ShadowGamers to obey as to try and curb his flailing behavior. These rules were pretty tame to what they could have been right?

Okay, so Shadowgamers most obviously agreed to those rules. Did a pretty good job of sticking to them right? I mean, in reality, Shadowgamers didn't do much of ''anything'' to be honest, not rule breaking, anyway, right?

Not according to [[Realitysquared]] apparently. [http://comments.deviantart.com/18/1103597/738557738 Apparently you] can [http://comments.deviantart.com/18/1103597/739118215 bend the probation rules] to suit your liking if you really want someone banned enough. But of course, it wouldn't be deviantART without the [http://forum.deviantart.com/community/complaints/1103597/ other user can getting off scot-free] despite being an even more offensive dick. 

=== Result of which ===

Following the banning, a [http://forum.deviantart.com/community/complaints/1104363/ thread was posted in the Complaints Forum]. For those who can't be bothered to read, the majority of the comments are split between Shadowgamers coming back from this ban (as he did before) to the ban was ''sort of'' justified. 

3 months later, during the drama that unfolded thanks to the unbanning of [[teruchan]], a petition was created, stating that if [[teruchan]] can be unbanned for something as minor as child porn, [http://psowill.deviantart.com/journal/20340178/ shadowgamers] can get unbanned for calling someone names.
The petition currently has 93 signers. It is most likely that the petition is going to be ignored by the Staffers, and either bans on both users reversed.

== Known Sockpuppet Accounts of Shadowgamers == 
One of ShadowGamers' former hobbies was to [http://comments.deviantart.com/2/26280/410131841 create sockpuppets] to piss what little friends he had and other people off (even if the account has nil interaction with the community), because ShadowGamers obviously wins enough at life to be a social winner and frequently praised sex-god Robot.<br>
