Bum
[[Image:Catman.jpg|thumb|A homeless person]]
Either an [[English]] [[ass]] or a homeless person in the [[USA]]. Thus one of the first-ever talkies, ''Hallelujah, I'm a Bum'', had to be renamed ''Hallelujah, I'm a Tramp'' in England. That title wouldn't have worked in America, where a tramp is "[[whore|a woman of loose morals]]".

To confuse the issue further, a [[fanny]] is an [[ass]] in the [[USA]], but a [[cunt]] in [[England]]. Robin Williams, on the other hand, is a [[cunt]] in anyone's language.
