== Alleged credit card leak ==

On the 31st of October, 2010, during a routine Sunday-evening [[circlejerk|intellectual discussion]] at [[The New Effort]], new poster "a llama", claiming to be an ex-employee of HostGator, created [http://www.theneweffort.com/goonburger-f8/topic11165.html a thread alleging that HostGator's billing system had been compromised].

*[http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/dz9fg/hostgator_loses_customer_credit_card_details/ Reddit thread]

{{squote|I happen to work for a rather large hosting company (read: HostGator) in the capacity as a System Administrator and was recently privy to the knowledge that the entire blade of billing servers were compromised and that '''all the credit card information stored in the recurring billing database was stolen''' and is now entirely in the wind; This includes '''full credit card numbers, expiration dates and CVV2 codes'''.

This company has '''chosen to hide this fact instead of report it'''.

For trying to expose the cover-up, '''I've been fired'''.|a llama}}

== HostGator responds ==

HostGator's Chairman, Brent, [http://www.theneweffort.com/goonburger-f8/topic11165.html#p223971 showed up], was baffled by BBCode, and managed to address a threatening reply to the wrong person:

{{squote|We will be [[Lolsuit|going after him legally]] for Libel due to the seriousness of the claims he makes based off of hearsay and rumors. I believe this claim he is making somehow originated from some type of rumor from us switching all of our office computers from [[windows]] to [[ubuntu]]. Things have been [[Fail|pretty chaotic]] for us during this upgrade.|Brent|posted in the TNE thread}}

Though he failed to make any argument beyond "nuh-uh", he did successfully [http://www.theneweffort.com/post224477.html#p224477 convince the world] of a culture of [[sexual_harassment|widespread sexual harassment]] at his company.

He also tried to [[internet_tough_guy|threaten the OP]] in a private message:

{{squote|The legal game you are playing has some very [[serious_business|serious implications]]. We have already Subpoenad somethingawful for your ip and will have it very soon. Once we have your ip we will be suing you for the full damages of your libel. What's even more serious is that if you do have proof of some type of hacking we aren't aware of, hiding this information from us becomes criminal and could result in jail time for you.

We obviously don't want you posting lies on the internet just as I'm sure you don't want us suing you. I suggest we talk this out over the phone or on aim to settle whatever vendetta you seemingly have against us. Please email me back your aim name to [dox], or call me at [dox]. If we aren't able to talk this out we will be proceeding with legal action.|Brent|forum private message to the OP}}

A company memo leaked on the 3rd of November, 2010:
{{squote|Anyone that can provide me with information to who this ex employee is I will provide a $1,000 reward to. Please email me at [dox email address], thanks!|Brent|internal company memo}}

Brent has been lurking in the thread in "invisible" mode regularly ever since. Why is he so nervous if the allegations are groundless?

<span id="update_bribe">UPDATE</span>: HostGator employee and [[lamer|professional troll]] [[#Rob|Rob]] was paid a special bonus by management to troll the TNE thread, in a ham-fisted effort to tarnish the credibility of any information there.
<center><gallery widths=350>
Image:hostgator_hirob.png|Hope you still get that bonus, Rob!
Image:hostgator_hirob2.png|Ooo, tough luck.
</gallery></center>

<span id="update_subpoena">UPDATE</span>: HostGator employee Brian Modanski used his dad's FBI connections to have an email sent to TNE proprietor Hangly Man:

Image:hostgator_subpoena.png|Sorry, Mr. Due, but I don't think the FBI has jurisdiction in Beijing. Nice try, though.

</gallery></center>

[http://www.theneweffort.com/goonburger-f8/topic11165-814.html#p227616 The FBI responds (indirectly)]: Special Agent Due has no clue what is going on, and said reporting the email to the FBI was the right thing to do. He was doubtful that there would be any action on the impersonation bit.

== Corroboration by other employees ==

TNE admins confirmed that the ex-employees were not using proxies or TOR and had plausible Texas-area ISPs.

|The fact that '''everyone in the HR department is married to an upper level staff member''' which creates a conflict of interest that is impossible to bypass for an employee.

|Each admin has root access to any server hosted by the company, including those hosting the customer's billing info.|NAUGHTY ON THE POTTY, ex-employee

|Should I also post on here how you made your now CEO go through people's FACEBOOK PRIVATE MESSAGES a few months ago and fired an employee over it? Should I also mention the fact that you made the person who was forced to cooperate or get fired employee of the month?|jvlas, ex-employee

|the dudes in charge will find any reason to give you shit / fire you. The management regularly reminds employees that they don't need a good reason to let them go. I've seen some really tenuous bullshit 'evidence' used to fire fellow employees just so HG wouldn't have to deal with unemployment claims.|NAUGHTY ON THE POTTY, ex-employee

|they all have spouses in HR. Basically if you have an issue with the management / supervisors, you literally can't take it to HR, or any of the management above them|NAUGHTY ON THE POTTY, ex-employee

|A few months ago, our new CEO Lance Custen (Brent's best friend, mind you), was basically going through employee's facebook messages because of "rumors" being said OUTSIDE the office, between employees. The option was basically let the "CEO" go through your private facebook messages, or get fired. |jvlas, ex-employee

|The original door had a door code that was the same code in that unlocked cvv2 encryption in their billing system. They later swapped to a system about two years later that uses the white cards many of you are familiar with for entry and exit of commercial buildings.|a llama, ex-employee

|After he saw some messages exchanged between the two employees, they fired one of them, and to cover their tracks, awarded employee of the month to the other.|jvlas, ex-employee

|One admin lovingly known as "derpville" managed to kill a VPS host node by installing bad RPMs and corrupting virtuozzo, and only got a slap on the wrist. I've seen others get suspensions for the day for checking Facebook just to check on the status of a family member.|"John", current employee

|HostGator's reseller servers are designed to house about 3-400 customers. Most of them have closer to 6-700 customers on them; HostGator purposefully oversells them to save money, which results in poor performance for its customers. If you complain, you will most likely be told its something to do with the SQL queries or some other random part of your code making the site run slow, and not HostGator's almighty servers.|"John", current employee

|Hard work without kissing management's ass will get you nowhere. However, if you kiss management's ass and screw up EVERY ticket you reply to, you will be rewarded with employee of the month or shift lead.|Jack, ex-employee

|Lance has it set up so he can watch all the cameras from his bedroom, on a projector at night when he can't sleep, and will call the supervisors when he sees someone slacking off|"John", current employee

|HostGator does not have timeclocks anymore, and as such, employees are required to get to work 10-15 minutes early to log in (working without being paid) just to use a web-based timeclock.|Jack, ex-employee

|The only mistake I made at HostGator was befriending coworkers (you know, teamwork and camaraderie, which they frown heavily upon). Per Lance, one friend ultimately stabbed me in the back for his own advancement in the company.|Jack, ex-employee

|The best thing that ever happened to me at HostGator was being forced to quit.|Jack, ex-employee

== Subpoena arrives ==
On 22 November, 2010, Hangly Man [http://www.theneweffort.com/post230190.html announced that he had received a subpoena] from Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark W. White III demanding the [[IP address]] of the original poster ([[#Alleged_credit_card_leak|See above]]). It also commands Hangly Man to fly to the opposite side of the planet and appear in a Houston courthouse. The document was addressed to his internet handle instead of his real name, and was curiously sent to him rather than his hosting provider.

Hangly Man responded with an address to which the Department of Justice can send some airline tickets.

{{squote|Rob was highly involved in the spamming operation. He is a known spammer and scam artist.

Rob was fired amid some as-yet-unknown drama. He was said to have "burned them pretty good" before he was terminated.
