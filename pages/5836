Not-Bob

A '''Not-Bob''' is a [[fandom]]-specific term for a [[troll]] who attacks people or [[community|communities]] s/he believes to have wronged them in some way -- i.e., a troll with a [[Epic fail guy|vendetta]]. On [[ED]], these people are referred to as "[[newfags|new users]]."

==Origin==
The first Not-Bob was a troll who got pissed off at {{ljcomm|pottersues}} for mocking a particular Mary Sue fanfic. Several people called the troll "Bob," because another [[anonymous]] troll on [[FanFiction.Net]] was attacking people for criticizing the same author. The troll replied "My name is not Bob!", to which someone else replied "Alright then, Not-Bob it is," and the name stuck.

These trolls are typically outraged [[Suethors]] or their friends. A favorite Not-Bob phrase is "U sUCk[[Oneoneone|!!1!1!!1111!1]]" repeated [[ad nauseam]]. They also bring their [[sockpuppets]] into the fray, to the [[fanfic lesbians]]' amusement.

Noted troll {{lj|FU_Deleterius}}'s technique consisted of rambling about tacos while using a Smurf icon, so Smurfs and tacos are associated with Not-Bobs.
