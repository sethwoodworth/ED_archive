{{lj|_sanderella}} is a former member of [[LJ Abuse]] who was fired from the team after making a series of lunatic public ''faux pas''.

An asset to the Abuse team, '''_sanderella's''' rampant idiocy made everyone else on the team look amazingly competent. Perhaps that's why they kept her around for as long as they did.
