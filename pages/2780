Do you like to click unknown URLs when someone sends them, including those [[tinyurl]] links? Do you keep your wifi open as an excuse if the [[RIAA]] [[internet lawsuit|sues]] you for [[warez]]ing? Do you run a [[Tor]] exit node? If so, soon the [[party van|van]] will be coming to your door. If you survive the bullet wounds, you will have a nice URL to give to everyone to get them vanned also.

[[Last thursday|In the past]] some lame techniques for FBI redirections where posted on 4Chan. Some of these were: [[The Great ImageFap Troll|Searching for "lolita" on imagefap.com]] or to [[irony|search for child porn on the FBI's website]]. But these are only meant to scare (mainly to troll) people, by letting them think that the FBI traced their IP address. However the real FBI redirection links get people vanned.

If you discover a real link, here's how to make the most of it: There's a program called XRumer meant for spamming that was made by [[Russia]]ns. It has an advanced AI that can decode all [[CAPTCHA]]s, determine what form fields to fill out, validate emails, and more. It gets you on every forum, blog, and guestbook spamming no matter what even if the site was coded just 20 minutes ago. It gathers tons of [[proxy|proxies]] that it will go through them until it finds an [[IP]] that's not blocked. Run this bastard with the FBI redirection link, advertise it as something legal, and [[Over 9000|100 million people]] will get vanned!

==Example of what happens==
Roderick Vosburgh, a doctoral student at Temple University who also taught history at La Salle University, was raided at home in February 2007 after he allegedly clicked on the FBI’s hyperlink. [[party van|Federal agents]] knocked on the door around 7 a.m., falsely claiming they wanted to talk to Vosburgh about his car. Once he opened the door, they [[Why don't you have a seat over there?|threw him to the ground]] outside his house, [[Don't Taze Me Bro|tazered]] him, and then handcuffed him.

Vosburgh was charged with violating federal law, which criminalizes “attempts” to download [[CP|child pornography]] with up to 10 years in prison. [[Last Thursday|Last November]], a jury found Vosburgh guilty on that count, and a sentencing hearing is scheduled for April 22, at which point Vosburgh could face three to four years in prison.

{{squote|<strong>...that the FBI can put a honeypot out there to attract people is kind of sad. It seems to me that they’ve brought a lot of cases without having to stoop to this.’”
Civil libertarians, “warn that anyone who clicks on a hyperlink advertising something illegal - perhaps found while Web browsing or received through e-mail - could face the same fate,” says the story, adding:
“When asked what would stop the FBI from expanding its hyperlink sting operation,  Jew, a longtime criminal defense Jew in Cambridge, Mass. and Jew of a forthcoming [[lies|book]] on the Justice Department, replied:

“Because the [[jews|courts]] have been so narrow in their definition of ‘entrapment,’ and so expansive in their definition of ‘probable cause,’ there is nothing to stop the Feds from acting as you posit.</strong>}}

It's unclear whether the link pointed to a site that had "FBI" emblazoned in big letters on it, with a search engine, or if it didn't. If it did, then we may consider the fact that someone would put in a search for child porn into it as grounds for approval on the basis on natural selection. A much nastier way to get people in trouble would be to find fake links like the one that Vosburgh clicked on and post a Tiny URL or equivalent for that. Considering that they arrested him shortly after, this method would in fact get people V& pretty quickly.
