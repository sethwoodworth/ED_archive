The '''Internet Watch Foundation''' is a [[UK]]-based organisation which does exactly what it says on the [[brb, soup|tin]] - watches the [[Internet]]. More precisely, it watches out for various types of [[internet law|illegal]] content - most prominently [[CP]], but it also won't tolerate [[racism|racist]] material or [[terrorist]] websites. This is all very much understandable in itself, but [[some argue]] that they are using their powers to scare people out of being able to exercise their right to [[censorship|freedom of speech]] online.

The IWF were also famous for blocking access to /[[b]]/ in [[at least 100 years ago|summer 2006]]. A [[4chanarchive]] [http://dis.4chan.org/read.php/img/1150410623/ thread] records the surrounding drama, and this was what led /b/ to conclude the real [[demotivator|motivations]] of the IWF staff, one of whom received emails from [[cockmongler|Richard C. Mongler]], inquiring as to what was going on.

It's clear that a site like the IWF would need to be based in Britain, given the [[batshit crazy|hysteria]] surrounding online content stirred up by [[tabloid]]s in the UK that is larger even than that in other countries.

i'll put a $500 bet down right now that some senior members of Internet Watch Foundation are in fact pedos.

The IWF is also extremely [[butthurt|concerned]] when it encounters racism. For example, this is illegal content if hosted in the [[1984|police state]] known as the UK:

{{Quote|[[newfag|Hi i´m a 18 year old boy from Denmark i just whant to tell, you one thing, FUCK YOU, what is your problem, are you are jude, or a negger, it´s true what the other gentlemen on your hate mail is saying neggers and judes are taken over, manly neggers around my country, we here in denmark have the same problem whit muslims, you know what that, they come here to destroy our faith in our father god, and his son, and the holly ghost, i say BURN THE MUSLIMS AND ALL OTHER NONE WHITE PROTESTANTS. HEIL HITLER. PS. the klan ku klux klan) is okay to.]]

[[Some argue]] that the IWF is an organisation set up by [[Tony Blair|New Labour]] to scare the populace into not exercising their rights to freedom of speech online. Pedophilia, racism and terrorism are bad things. Few people dispute that. But who's gonna say that they're not going to block access to websites containing material which might allow people to think for themselves outside the mass media? After all, these epithets are ones that people are scared of - like being called a witch in 17th century New England, or being called a [[communist]] in 1950s [[America]]. Historically, these labels have been attached to people who they don't apply to at all, and the fear is that it may be happening again. The [[UK]] seems to be going down the same path as [[Australia]], and the internet'll just be like cable [[TV]] by the time they're finished with it.

Indeed, a British man recently was convicted for criminally obscene content for writing a story about the rape and murder of the band Girls Aloud, thanks to the IWF's efforts. Sure, the story was in poor taste. But it was a work of fiction. Using the same [[law]] that led to the banning of the book Lady Chatterley's Lover back [[at least 100|50 years ago]], he is currently being prosecuted. This would never have happened ten years ago. In the [[Web 2.0]] age, it's much easier to publish a document - you can write something crazy in a bad mood or weird state of mind without doing so much as to have to say a single word or leave your chair. Isn't this just like George Orwell's [[1984]] where the 'telescreen' can monitor your thoughts better than anything else can? Didn't this man deserve mental help instead of prosecution? Again, no satisfactory answers have been given.

Thankfully, there are organisations like [http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/ Liberty] in Britain who support a sensible and rational approach, rather than the 'burn it, kill it, rip it up' which is like the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate Two Minutes Hate], again in Orwell's 1984. The IWF really should tackle the root of the problem, rather than use fear tactics against people who are not criminals. For example, even searching for [[BBW]] porn may generate one of their messages in Google [http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&q=%22delicious+on+demand%22&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi]. Makes no sense at all.

==The English-Wikipedian Holocaust==
[[Image:VirginKiller.jpg|thumb|[[Virgin Killer|This CP]] is now [[Internet Watch Foundation|IWF]] approved and [[FBI]] approved: [[Fap]] away]]
With good intentions, [[Wikipedian]]s started an "Academic" Child Porn portal to educate people on the historical controversy. With good intentions, the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] decided to blacklist English Wikipedia over the [[Virgin Killer]] article to prevent the English from [[lie|accidentally]] viewing "potentially illegal" content. With good intentions, the British ISP placed 95% of England in a cleanfeed (TM) [[The Holocaust|Concentration camp]] with only 8 transparent [[proxies]]. With good intentions, WikiMedia implemented [[Final Solution]] after detecting [[vandalism]] to prevent those 8 proxies from further edits. As a result, much [[lulz]] is generated from the over generosity of good intentions.
