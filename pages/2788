FLAC
[[Image:Flac.gif|right|250px]]

If you often [[piracy|download music]] from the [[internet]] (and come on, who doesnâ€™t?), then you may occasionally notice a bizarre occurrence with your audio files.  Prepped and excited to listen to whatever shitty album you've just downloaded, you notice that the size is a bit off.  You would usually expect a download size of anywhere from 50-100 [[Computer|megabytes]], but this particular download just happens to be 3.5 gigabytes in size.  Curious and [[confused]], you examine the contents of the folder to find nothing out of the ordinary; all 12 songs are there along with a small .jpg for the album art.  You play the files, and to your surprise, nothing sounds different.  But you then notice that the songs are encoded in some strange format called '''FLAC'''.  

At this point, you either [[delete]] the folder and search for something of a more reasonable size or you begrudgingly keep the files.  But one lingering question still leaves you puzzled: what's the deal with this FLAC bullshit?

==What is FLAC?==
[[Image:Hipsters.jpg|thumb|right|300px|These are the [[Transvestites|kind of]] [[Hipsters|people]] that use FLAC.]]
Since the dawn of modern sound recording with the invention of the phonograph, there have always been individuals that strive to attain the maximum possible sound quality for the best possible listening experience.  These individuals then go to great lengths to [[USI|tell everyone else how much better their audio equipment is and how they cannot possibly imagine how us filthy peasants can enjoy music of such poor quality]].  These people are known as <s>faggots</s> [[audiophile]]s, and they are amongst the most pathetic creatures to ever inhabit the [[Earth]].

In modern day, with digital audio formats being so popular, it is quite easy for one to be an [[elitist]] prick when it comes to music.  Audiophiles today take great pride in owning physical copies of all of their music and will frequently bitch and whine about how terrible digital audio sounds compared to [[CD]]s or vinyl records.  However, buying music can be pretty damn expensive, so Jew audiophiles needed a way to act like elitist [[cunt]]s without also breaking the bank.  And thus, '''F'''ree '''L'''ossless '''A'''udio '''C'''odec, or FLAC, was born.

Lossless audio formats have been around for a few years, and people did a good job of ignoring them for a while.  However, they are sadly becoming more popular and pissing off more people by appearing in their music downloads.  There are a few different kinds of lossless formats, such as [[Apple]]'s ALAC and [[Microsoft]]'s WMA Lossless, but FLAC is still far and away the most popular.  The one thing all of these lossless formats have in common is that they are made entirely by and for raging [[douchebag]]s.

So, you may be wondering what's so special about "lossless" audio.  Well, you see, when digital audio files are ripped from CDs in traditional formats ([[mp3]], m4a, aac, wma, ogg, [[etc]].), there is a certain amount of data that is lost during the process.  [[SNCA|Lossless audio formats eliminate these losses, and are essentially exact copies of the source material]].  The drawback to lossless audio is that it's not compressed anywhere near as much as standard digital audio files, and thus takes up roughly 85-90 times as much hard drive space as identical sounding "lossy" files.

These tiny bits of lost sound data that your [[dog]] wouldn't even be able to hear are inconsequential when listening to the music, as any high quality mp3 rip from a modern encoder is going to be nigh impossible to differentiate from the actual CD.  However, one purpose of recovering that lost sound in a digital format is to give snobby music listeners a false sense of superiority.  Thus, [[some argue|it can be said]] that FLAC is pure, unadulterated [[Obama|elitism]], in audio form.  Basically, it's .wav but can only be played by shitty vlc.

Supporters of this '''[[XBOX]]-HUGE''' format will often jump into audiophile technical bullshit mode when confronted with the [[truth]], rambling on about how with FLAC, the highs are higher and the lows are lower and the bass is bassier and the midrange is more middly, even though most FLAC supporters only listen to lo-fi [[indie]] garbage, anyway.  When engaged in such an [[debate|argument]], your best course of action is to simply close your [[browser]] window, since these people will never listen to reason.  If you're unfortunate enough to be having this debate [[IRL]], it is strongly advised that you [[falcon punch|punch]] the opposing party in the face and walk away.

===Uses for FLAC===
*Master copies (only legit use.)
*Making idiots feel special [[OTI|on the internet]] when they brag about how they can hear tiny differences between FLAC and high quality mp3s, despite the fact that '''auditory [[experts]] can't even do this'''
*Letting [[asshole]]s brag about how large their music collections are, even though this is only due to their use of such a bloated format and that a normal person could have ten times as much music and still take up less space
*Allowing techno-geeks to fill their needlessly large 50-terabyte hard drive setups with something other than vast quantities of [[anime]] and [[porn]]
*Helping hardware companies sell more [[iPod|portable audio players]] by making older models obsolete, since most players don't support lossless audio
*Giving audiophiles validation for owning that $8,000 pair of headphones, so that they can pretend to be able to hear the inaudible frequencies that they "lost" with mp3s
*Quick, efficient [[e-penis]] enhancement

==FLAC [[Copypasta]]==
{{squote|Hearing the difference now isn't the reason to encode to FLAC. FLAC uses lossless compression, while MP3 is 'lossy'. What this means is that for each year the MP3 sits on your hard drive, it will lose roughly 12kbps, assuming you have SATA - it's about 15kbps on IDE, but only 7kbps on SCSI, due to rotational velocidensity. You don't want to know how much worse it is on CD-ROM or other optical media.

I started collecting MP3s in about 2001, and if I try to play any of the tracks I downloaded back then, even the stuff I grabbed at 320kbps, they just sound like crap. The bass is terrible, the midrange...well don't get me started. Some of those albums have degraded down to 32 or even 16kbps. FLAC rips from the same period still sound great, even if they weren't stored correctly, in a cool, dry place. Seriously, stick to FLAC, you may not be able to hear the difference now, but in a year or two, you'll be glad you did.|'''THIS IS WHAT AUDIOPHILES ACTUALLY BELIEVE'''}}

and...

{{squote|actually, the man knows what he's talking about, albeit, petty or nonsense to most people. when i've gone back to some really old mp3's from way back 'in-the-day' (90's, Napster, 56k modem) most of my mp3 library sounds like crap, mostly due to the technologies available at the time. i notice an unusually large amount of "pops" in a lot of songs and a 128k rip sounds more flat than a new 128k rip (both sound terrible regardless). anybody who knows how data is written to a disc would know that bits do get lost over time.

i'm an arrogant, elitist, analog snob with 2 vintage hifi systems (1 solid state/1 tube based) that can expose every imperfection in an mp3 file. it absolutely cracks me up when people think their crappy OEM soundcard, crappy best buy cables, and crappy desktop speakers are suitable benchmarks for judging sound quality.

it's pathetic how nowadays people have allowed themselves to compromise quality over convenience and cost. i'm only 34 but just as bitter and scornful as someone twice my age. just wait until i get my FLAC vinyl rip blog up and running!|'''Well, he's certainly right about being an arrogant, elitist, analog snob, everything else is bullshit.}}

==The Problem with FLAC==
[[Image:Placebo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[science|Scientists]] were recently able convert FLAC to a [[drug]] form.  The results were predictable.]]
[[You]] may now be thinking,

''"Well, this FLAC shit sure sounds useless, but it doesn't seem to be much of a problem.  People who use it may be [[pretentious]] [[faggot]]s, but that's their choice, so it shouldn't matter to me, right?  I mean, people still use [[Linux]], and they're mostly harmless."''

You would be correct if not for the fact that lossless audio formats are rapidly becoming more popular, and thus accounting for more of ''your'' potential downloads.  With [[The Man]] making life for the modern-day [[pirate]] harder every day, online [[torrent|file-sharing]] can be an inefficient means to get your greedy hands on the things you want.

Most mainstream or popular music can be found easily in various forms, but many older or more obscure works are often harder to find and have only a few viable sources from which to download.  Because of this, many albums are commonly available ''only'' in FLAC (or some other lossless crap).  This problem can be even worse if you're looking for something more obscure like a [[video game]] or [[weeaboo|anime OST]].  Of course, there are ways to fix this, but it would be nice to not have to go through a pain-in-the-ass decoding/encoding process every goddamn time you wanna download some music.

===Okay, so how do I get rid of this shit?===
As previously stated, it is possible to correct the terrible mistake that is lossless audio.  All you need to do is re-encode the files in a format that doesn't suck.  To do this, you need some sort of decoding/encoding software, plenty of which is readily accessible through the power of [[Google]].  If you can't be assed to look yourself, allow [[ED]] to recommend some stuff for you:
*[http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html FLAC Frontend] FLAC themselves offer a program that will easily encode or decode FLAC. Isn't that nice of them?
*[http://www.dors.de/razorlame/index.php RazorLame] - Front-end for LAME (An MP3 encoder) so you don't have to fuck with command lines or source code.  You still need LAME, so get it [http://www.rarewares.org/mp3-lame-bundle.php here].
*[[Winamp]]/[[iTunes]] - If you already have both Winamp and iTunes, you can pull this off quite easily.  Download [http://www.winamp.com/plugin/flac-plugin-with-library-support/143614 this FLAC plugin] for Winamp if you don't already have it, and use it to decode the FLAC files to .wav files.  Then use the encoder that comes with iTunes to encode the .wav files to whatever format you want.
*[http://www.nero.com/enu/technologies-aac-codec.html Nero AAC Codec] Won a bunch of awards that are only important to audiophiles. Or maybe it didn't. Who gives a fuck? No front-end, but the command-line is fairly straight-forward. It works for Windows and Linux. Apple fanbois need not apply.
*[http://www.rarewares.org/ogg-oggdropxpd.php OggDropXPd] Drag and drop FLAC files, and it will automatically convert them to OGG. Also supports other annoying lossless formats like APE, WAVpack and LPAC!

===Combating FLACfags===
For easy [[trolling]] of FLAC users, follow this simple guide:

#Take audio files from your music library, and make ''very'' low quality mp3s out of them (encode in something like 32 kbps with constant bitrate (CBR))
#Re-encode those same files as .flac files
#Upload files to [[rapidshare]], mediafire, megaupload, [[bittorrent]], etc. (make sure to mark them as FLAC)
#[[????]]
#[[PROFIT!]]
Bonus points if you intentionally mislabel the song titles.

==To sum it all up==
FLAC is pure, unadulterated fucking garbage. The only people who claim to acknowledge the difference between properly encoded 320 bitrate "lossy" mp3s and "loseless" FLAC audio are pretentious, [[hipster]] trash [[Unwarranted self-importance|who think they are better than you]] because you "totally don't dig" the new [[Indie|Vampire Weekend]] album. It's a waste of hard drive space and so is .WAV (5 minute song = 55 megabytes, seriously). If you don't want to be a faggot, stick to mp3s.
On the other hand though, mp3 is not ideal too. A lot of music on the 'nets are not ripped at 320 kbps CBR but is usually around 128-160 CBR, which do actually sound like crap on good quality headphones. Also, encoding with mp3 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapless_playback is not sample-accurate and does not technically allow gapless playback], hence hindering listening experience of, for example, Pink Floyd's "The Wall" by introducing clicks between tracks. This can be somewhat cured by crossfading, but one will not be able to record a CD with gapless playback out of mp3 sources.

tl;dr, Use OGG, faggot.
