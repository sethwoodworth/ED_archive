'''Chris Beer owns the internet. He spammed 4chan and made moot cry.'''

Some time during the hours of April 10th, [[2010]], [[moot]] posted in a sitewide notice an "ultimatum from a [[spam]]mer": a brief demand from Chris Beer to ban [[New Zealand]] from 4chan in return for 4chan advertising space to be of his sites. This meant that he would no longer need to spam [[/b/]] which had endured his spam for months. With the vicious results that /b/ provided mere weeks ago with regards to [[Kimmo Alm]]'s spam, this clearly was a move by a bored and annoyed moot to rally the massive forces of his website to destroy yet another Internet pest. After a brief period of time moot discovered that he'd received several emails from this source and posted them all [http://content.4chan.org/tmp/chris_beer_emails.txt here], with a note that [[Googling]] the email address (crebzx@hotmail.com) leads to some "[[gay|interesting]]" results. /b/, predictably, has worked itself into a frenzy trying to find and destroy that which has incensed their leader. In spite of all this Anonymous have set up an irc could join the fight for /b/ today! He got the attention of 4chan again a few months later after moot put a four-figure bounty on his information, it was never found. This could be due to the fact that Chris Beer is unlikely to be his real name, rather an alias.

'''Chris beer is Moot'''

I wasn't supposed to say anything, but when the spamming started, a few brave Anon's followed me into an IRC hoping to catch the slippery bastard and give him his what's for.
After hours of deliberation, debating and fapping.  We came to the solid conclusion that Chris Beer was Moot.   

There was some speculation as to why Moot would spam his own site, but those idiots were quickly silenced when the obvious answer:  Moot was testing our loyalties was thrown out into the open.

It was also believed but unconfirmed that moot was posing as an underage b& in said IRC.

The only people "spamming" this pasta now are idiot trolls.

Good day to you fucking niggers.

Love,
Me.


PS...

Please forgive me /b/rothers.  I'm sick of hearing about this fake queef. 

'''The above is only a theory however'''

==Copypasta==
Look at you freaks. All you do is sit on the computer and get mad when I spam your shitty imageboard. If I ever met one of you in real life I would beat the fuck out of you just to teach you a lesson about how you are wasting your already pathetic life. I get so much pussy. I am having a threesome in the shower right now on my waterproof laptop which I made myself.

Me and my boys caught some kid at school with a 4chan lunchbox, we beat the fuck out of him with our huge muscles. I then smashed the lunchbox and pissed on the ashes. I was doing him a favour, he was wasting his life, he will thank me one day. You are all such ugly little nerds. I once fucked a girl so hard that she died. None of you losers will ever accomplish anything like this because you are at home everyday playing video games and fapping.

Oh and in case any of you faggots didn't know, my dad is an FBI commander and my mum is a CIA commander. They let me get away with anything so don't bother trying to report me. My dad even said that if I behave well he will shut down 4chan for me on my next birthday.

==Spamming==
Chris Beer has been spamming 4chan for months. He was one of the main [[fail|Sharecash]] spammers who was paid $3805.86 by them in December for all the cancerous spam threads he made. He also owned the site easyvouch.com which he spammed all over 4chan and the rest of the internets.

I laughed so hard today when this faggot came up to me crying that I got our 
ISP banned from 4chan. You guys must do this on purpose. You do realise I have 
shitloads of private proxies and by banning my ISP your only affecting other people? 
Keep it banned forever.

You ban all the New Zealand ISPs from 4chan and replace all the ad places on your site 
with a link to <nowiki>http://best.*****.it</nowiki>
The reason I want the ISPs banned is because the reactions from people I know 
irl are fucking priceless since they know its me and my friends who got 
it banned. And I must generate more profit from the ads than I do from spamming.
