-My ''Price is Right'' signoff

And now, we've come full circle to the very reason why I even registered for this site to begin with. I was just an ordinary artist on DeviantArt under the name "A-l-e-x-99". Then, I was SUDDENLY, DELIBERATELY, and UNFAIRLY PERMABANNED!!! Was I trolling someone? Was I spamming up the site with my propaganda? No. I was just telling the truth. And because that truth just HAPPENED to contain a reference to "Googling someone's home address, buying a gun, and blowing his goddamn head off", RealitySquared raped me in the ass, disrespected everything I did for DeviantArt in the two years that I had been using the site, and kicked me off the moving bus.

But wait! He wasn't acting alone. As it turns out, he was merely an accessory to crime. The person who REALLY killed me on DeviantArt was the dipshit whose head I was threatening to blow off: a black stereotype of a BE fetishist in Indianapolis, Indiana named "MDetector5".

What happened? What was the truth that I was telling? Why did I make the threat? What will I do now that I'm no longer part of DeviantArt? And what is he trying to PROVE!?! You're about to find out. For Monday, June 16, 2008...I'm getting my REVENGE, as the St. Clair Publications Week in Review begins now!

===Who I am===

I'm Alex St. Clair. I was born in Woodbridge, VA on February 6, 1988. My parents moved to Roanoke, VA shortly thereafter (after living in the Washington D.C. area for EIGHT YEARS! D:), and then to our current home in nearby Franklin County in 1990.

A lot of kids are into drawing at the age of 2. That's one of the things we were encouraged to do in preschool and in elementary school, and that's what I was encouraged to do throughout my life. On my desk, I would often decorate my nametag. I would take crayons and color everything in sight. At home, I'd draw on a chalkboard. It was just something I did.

But most everyone else I knew began to "grow out of it". Not me. By 1998, I was drawing scenery from Mario games, Mario series enemies, severe weather maps...everything I could get my hands on. I was drawing in pen, with markers, with colored pencils, and everything else I could get my hands on.

I had always loved the comics in The Roanoke Times. Garfield and Peanuts, especially. Doonesbury, Non Sequitur, and Beetle Bailey were also very funny. And, on one or two rare occasions, even the boredom known as The Family Circus would make me chuckle. Plus, as far as TV went, I grew up on the standard diet of the 1990's, such as Scooby-Doo, Looney Tunes, and Tom and Jerry. There were also great classics on like Beakman's World, Bill Nye the Science Guy, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. ABC had its own round of kick-ass cartoons like Pepper Ann, Recess, and Squigglevision. And all this influenced me in some way.

I had always wanted to draw my own, but never really got anything off the ground until 1999. My main flaw was my ability to draw humans. Try as I might, I just could not wrap my head around human anatomy. So, I relegated myself to drawing the aforementioned backgrounds and maps.

But in late 1998, everything changed. I had just recently gotten a brand new computer, and that computer also came with The Complete Idiot's Guide to Windows 95. I noticed that the book contained a ton of metaphors like "wandering into some unknown Windows neighborhood" and "giving Windows Explorer a poke in the ribs by hitting F5". I was compelled to draw out literal versions of those metaphors. And, in February 1999, the first St. Clair Publications comic strip, Windows 95, was born!

It wasn't much of a comic strip in the normal sense. I just took a sheet of paper and drew out what I felt. Also, the "characters" were just words and phrases with eyes. And sticks for arms and legs. And the strips were in black and white. Quite a far cry from the colorful, busty girl in the Picture of the Day up there, isn't it? D: The reason why the comic was like this is because I was ashamed of the way I had drawn humans back in 2nd grade, and didn't wanna draw 'em. But, not long after the strip debuted, I was starting to get into the Pokémon craze, and I made a sketch in which Ash Ketchum's Pokédex argued with Windows Explorer...a situation that kinda sorta necessitated Ash being in there. So I drew Ash in, but only his head.

The next day, I drew Ash again, but his whole body this time. Also, I shaded in his hair. After that, I made hair shading a standard practice. As long as I drew comics in black and white, everyone would have their hair shaded in. Even blondes. And then I drew Ash again, and again, and again. And then I added in some other humans, like Misty, Brock, and Team Rocket. And by that time, humans became commonplace.

I hadn't been resting my laurels on this one comic strip, though. By March 1999, I was exploring other ways to draw. A comic book full of classic Peanuts strips from the 1970's became my next inspiration: I liked how the comic strips were arranged in that book, and so, on a clean sheet of notebook paper, I drew a comic strip of my own in a similar style. The paper was divided into four panels, with a little strip up at the top for the title and author, and a strip on the side of the first panel for the copyright information. Sometimes, the title strip would also contain the name of the episode. This comic was either about Pokémon or Mario, depending on my mood. It has been retroactively titled "The Super Mario Bros./Pokémon Hour". This strip carried me through the rest of the school year.

June 1999 was a milestone for me. I had finally finished 5th grade and was moving on to middle school. And, in the intervening summer, my drawing skills underwent a big-time growth spurt! I had recently become a Scooby-Doo fan, and felt it necessary to express my fandom through my drawing skills. Drawing the Mystery Inc. crew taught me a lot about what I could and couldn't draw at the time. For example, Scooby-Doo. I, to this day, have extreme difficulty drawing animals, and a quick sketch of him will prove that to you! xD I continued drawing Scooby-Doo stuff into the rest of 1999, and quit when Peanuts was retired in early 2000.

But I didn't quit drawing. I continued, and my next strip was one slightly more creative: The Hex Girls. Based on a rock band featured in Scooby-Doo and the Witch's Ghost, the three main characters of the strip acted like a "modern-day" Mystery Inc. that solved mysteries using more advanced technology. (Keep in mind that this was before the debut of CSI: Vegas on CBS! :D)

In June 2000, I revived my love of Scooby-Doo with a new project called "Scooby-Doo: The Afterlife", so named because Mystery Inc. had been retired when the strip debuted, and I wanted to answer the age-old question, "What happens after retirement?" In this strip, Mystery Inc. actually comes out of retirement to solve mysteries again. By this point, my comics had begun to take on a few changes. A second strip appeared right next to the copyright strip; this strip showed a website of some sort. Also, by Halloween of 1999, I began dating the strips; the date appeared in the upper left corner of the first panel. Finally, by January 2000, I began drawing Sunday strips in a special style: eight panels, with a special title card in the first, and the actual strip in the remaining seven. Similar to Garfield.

Also, I began drawing a few other comic strips. The most notable being a little sketch comedy called The World of Nintendo, in which I showed people that I hadn't neglected Mario and Ash Ketchum. They combined forces with Donkey Kong, Kirby, Banjo, and Kazooie for many lulz. :D

Throughout the rest of 2000 until the summer of 2001, I tried drawing three-panel daily comics and six-panel Sunday comics, but something didn't quite feel right, so I ditched those.

Beginning in the summer of 2000, and by August of 2001, I was making a lot of special pictures I call "Promotional Drawings", which, at the time, were essentially glorified fanart. What I did was look at a source picture and simply draw what I saw, then colored it. At the time, these pictures were the ONLY ones I drew in color. I drew them in the hopes that they would help me improve my drawing skills, but until I drew a picture of Sara Bellum of The Powerpuff Girls in August 2001, nothing really got off the ground. After that picture, however, I began experimenting to see what she would look like in my normal drawing style, and that's how the first curvy-bodied girls were born. To this day, some people still simply remember me as "the guy with the girls that have oversized chests"! xD

Not much changed in 2002, but by the spring, I began thinking ahead to high school. Those thoughts manifested themselves into a comic strip that tackled the issues facing high schoolers at the time. But as the summer wore on, the initial idea evolved into a superhero-type comic strip in which a male cheerleader fought against NFL cheerleaders. And THOSE ideas evolved into what is now Life in FCHS.

And the rest is history. In August 2003, many characters got an overhaul in their appearance, and in October 2003, I began drawing comics in color. Also, since February 2004, I have experimented with single-panel comic strips, à la The Far Side. And in 2009, I plan to draw my comics digitally. (As you can see in the Picture of the Day at the top, I'm already COLORING them digitally.) But the heart and soul of my comic strips has remained the same.

There are still flaws in my drawing style. I still have problems with anatomy, with bending humans into certain positions, and I can't draw animals worth a crap. (Which is a good thing, given the abundance of so-called "furfags" on here, DeviantArt, and elsewhere...) But I think I could break into the profession if given the chance. :)

===Meeting of the Minds===

I registered for DeviantArt on July 13, 2006. But before that, I lurked for a bit. The first DeviantArt user I ever visited was a girl named EliteFourLorelei. And through her, I discovered a whole host of other users. The most notable ones being SozokuReed (a British animé artist with a small bondage fetish who became the first deviant I ever added to my friends list), Blue-Leader (a guy who drew some weird art; this art would briefly land him an Encyclopedia Dramatica article circa March 2008, but it's been deleted), and MDetector5.

What drew me to MDetector was his inclusion of Price is Right Turntable backgrounds. I thought I would be the only TPIR fan on the site, so this came as a surprise. Of course, he had BE fetish art, just as he does today, but I found it funny back then. He also had lots of Daria fanart (including one picture, FC Hooters Girls, that still makes me laugh a little because of the dragged-out way in which he has Tiffany Blum-Deckler talk), and even a comic called "n00b and Jim". I thought, "Hmmmm. Interesting." But I couldn't add him to my DevWatch, as I hadn't registered yet. xD

===The Glory Days===

Although MDetector5 eventually found my gallery in November 2006 and decided to watch me, the friendship was short lived. In December 2006, I had to quit DeviantArt because I got in just a little too far over my head in controversy. But in May 2007, I returned. And MDetector5 and I formed a better, longer lasting bond. We traded comments back and forth when we thought it was necessary to...nothing special. He was still making me laugh with his BE art, and his other art was good in my eyes (although not great), so I really had no reason to be suspicious of him.

I didn't re-add him to my DevWatch until about a month after I returned, so all that drama-llama-ing with Arshes Nei was unknown to me, and he hadn't been generating any other bad news, so all was good in the land of St. Clair Publications. Or so I thought... D:

===MDetector Jumps the Shark===

In August 2007, as I got ready to begin a new semester at Virginia Western, I checked my DevWatch to find that a "TPIR35" had added me to their friends list. Also, that user left a Note (private message) in my inbox, saying that he was MDetector5 circumventing a 30-day ban. I went to MDetector's page and, sure enough, it said that he was banned. TPIR35 told me to add him, but I silently and politely declined.

When he returned, I noticed a sharp decline in the quality of his pictures. He drawings began to resemble derivative animé, and some deviants who apparently had critiqued him were starting to chew him out. Also, his DeviantJournals reeked of the kind that the infamous Snapesnogger would write. So, on September 2007, I silently removed him from my DevWatch. He continued to watch me, and I expressed no problems with this, so all was well again. Or was it?

===I Get Suspicious===

Just before Season 36 of The Price is Right began, I logged in to see a big ol' "!" by his user name. Thinking that MDetector5 had finally bitten the big one, I blocked him so he'd go off my DevWatch, then unblocked him 'cuz there was no point in blocking a permabanned user. But then, as we got closer to the big season premiere, I logged in to find a rather startling message: "MDetector5 has added you to their friends list."

How in the...!?! What in the...!?! Why in the...!?! O_o O_o O_o

Even HE appeared startled that he had been unbanned. At least, that's what it said in the journal that I had read... D:

But still, I expressed no objection over him watching me. As time wore on, however, I began to notice a considerable decline in the quality of his comments. For example, the first journal that I wrote in 2008 was written in anger over a website shutting down. MDetector's comment, however, said something about me having a problem with such users as Teruchan and SigurdHosenfeld. I only mentioned those two because they had Encyclopedia Dramatica pages; I was comparing DeviantArt and its troubles to the troubles the other website was complaining about.

A constructive critique on Super Mario Galaxy prompted a comment from him WAY out in left field that made him seem to think I had a problem with Super Mario Bros. 2. And so on, and so forth... The comments made me think that there was something...not right about him.

I had foreseen an Encyclopedia Dramatica page coming for him as early as September 2007. And in May 2008, when I logged into the site early in the morning, I woke up to find that my worst fear had been realized...

===Encyclopedia Dramatica Weighs In===

[[MDetector5|[clicky-clicky! ^^]]] <!-- This was a link to his ED page -->

When I saw that article, I went BALLISTIC!!! And then I spewed out a very hateful DeviantJournal against him. I also blocked him. I am a respectable cartoonist. I have ambitions to be the next Hanna-Barbera. And contrary to popular belief, anyone that has an Encyclopedia Dramatica page typically deserves it for one reason or another. So I did not want MDetector5 around me anymore. And in the DeviantJournal, amidst all the hate and the threat to blow his goddamn head off, I explained why I didn't want him around me VERY CLEARLY. [[:Image:A-l-e-x-99-mdetector5-journal-lol-cropped.png|[clicky-clicky! ^^]]]

The journal, if you read it all the way through, was actually a very reasonable response as far as I'm concerned. I did indeed feel betrayed by MDetector5, and I had said in previous journals (that he read and commented on!) that I will let my opinions out regardless of what you think of them. And he even AGREED with me on that point! I exist to tell it like it is. I don't exist to comfort people...I'm here to dole out the unabashed, uncensored truth about someone or something. That "If you can't say nothin' nice..." line from Thumper in Bambi doesn't fly in St. Clair Publications. And sometimes the truth hurts! But it must be said, in my eyes!

And he had been supporting my "tell it like it is" campaign since October 2007, when I chose to make a deviant by the name of [[Snapesnogger]] <!-- Original linked to dA --> a villain in my comic strip, Life in FCHS. So, for the life of me, I cannot understand why he'd turn tail like he has when my criticism turned to him. Apparently, that evil cheerleader named Alex St. Clair is only evil if he's excommunicated you from his circle of friends...! :rolleyes:

Now, when I write a DeviantJournal blasting a fellow deviant, and even go so far as to threaten to Google their home address, buy a gun, and blow their goddamn head off...that means that that fellow deviant needs to pay close attention to the journal and heed its contents as constructive advice...especially if they think that I'm seriously gonna carry out such a threat and if they value their puny lives! >x) In that journal, I mentioned his little war with Arshes Nei (also a DeviantArt user) and said that I wanted to add her to my DevWatch, but wouldn't because she draws art that, quite frankly, makes me vomit. (No offense, Arshes, if you read this... :'() I also compared MDetector5 to Snapesnogger...the two are strikingly similar to each other, don't'cha know? I also told him that the only way to get unblocked and be forgiven for his sins is to get the ED article removed. I also told him that "he knew what he had to do" from reading my previous journals, but, in retrospect, I now realize that I didn't say anything about getting an ED article removed in those journals! ^^; ^^; ^^;

So let me explain. To get an Encyclopedia Dramatica article on you removed, you need to quit giving them what they want. ED criticizes MDetector as a stalker who whores out a ton of commissions and does way too much BE fetish art. So, the answer to that? Quit stalking! Do some REAL art. Lay off the BE fetish!

But that's not what MDetector did. First, he responded to a comment I left on "Bee BE Go Bye-Bye", the last picture I ever commented on on his account. I haven't read that comment, and I'm scared to, but according to Encyclopedia Dramatica, it appears that he went off the deep end. Instead of admitting defeat and taking a hiatus from DevArt to think about what he did, he only did MOAR of it! Proving his ED article true in the process! [[:Image:Mdetector5-a-l-e-x-99-response.png|[clicky-clicky! ^^]]]

Are you kidding me!?! He sounds like fucking Chris Crocker in that comment!!!

Oh, and on the DeviantJournal itself, a user named LuisaRafidi (which also happens to be the name of a character in MD5's universe) left another comment. I didn't read that one, either, but ED appears to imply that she was trolling me. To use the exact quote...

A Loyal Friend and True of MDetector5's reported to anonymous that he plans to make several sockpuppet accounts pretending to be teenage Japanese magical school girls to convince this guy to unblock MDetector5 and worship him for the talented artist he is. OH SHI-- WE GAVE HIS PLAN AWAY!!! But that won't stop him on his QUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT!

And then suddenly, just before June 3rd's episode of The Price is Right...I logged in to find myself permabanned. Not only that, but...

Encyclopedia Dramatica
Sources say MD continues to whine to his Loyal Friends and True that this guy deserved the banhammer for writing awful things about such a talented artist as he. Plz give MDetector5 less of the cold harsh truth and moar asspats and donations. If not, you'll receive the banhammer and MDetector5 will deal drugs...

So...not only does the goddamn motherfucker get me b&...he slanders me as well! He hits me while I'm down!!! Again, he takes a Snapesnogger approach: characterizing his haters as basement-dwellers with no life. Problem is, I often found Snapesnogger's haters to be fans of Severus Snape (just like her) or Harry Potter in general that DID have lives outside of DevArt and meant SRS BSNS. Just like me. And what MDetector5 is saying against me could be grounds for a lawsuit!

Of course, RealitySquared, being the [[RealitySquared|dumbass that he is]], claims, through the Help Desk, that he blackballed me because of the "blow goddamn head off" bit in the journal. Dumb fuck. I understand this is his site, and he can run it however he sees fit, and the sheer size of DeviantArt makes the rules difficult to enforce...but that statement was not meant to be taken as an actual threat! He went too far. Instead of giving me a chance to defend myself, he just went for the banhammer. Isn't that the kind of stuff we criticized John Ashcroft for...jailing people without giving them access to a lawyer or due process of law?

Together, he and MDetector5 took a serious cartoonist with serious ambitions to do SRS BSNS who was heavily involved in DevArt's politics (the Jark scandal, most notably) and stomped all over him like a common spammer.

And the grand irony is...they only ENCOURAGED me to carry out the threat in the journal! If RealitySquared really thought I was gonna kill MDetector5, he should've encouraged me to NOT carry out the threat by banning MDetector5 instead! This conundrum, under the heading of "zero tolerance", is displayed over and over and over again in nearly every school I've been to since the Columbine shootings, with school teachers, principals, and other leaders actually CREATING more school shooters than they want to eliminate! And, as Seung-Hui Cho showed us in the Virginia Tech Massacre, the tightest restraints possible on the 1st and 2nd Amendments STILL don't stop people who genuinely want to commit a violent school shooting from doing it!

I am not happy. And I do plan to avenge this incident. Not by blowing their goddamn heads off (tempted as I am to do so... xD), but by suing their asses off!!! I live only 20 minutes from a federal court in Roanoke, VA...it's not THAT hard! >xO

I do not deserve a ban. I deserve SENIOR MEMBERSHIP!!! I deserve to be "`A-l-e-x-99". Or at least "=A-l-e-x-99"! This LiveJournal entry represents my first attempt to right this wrong. And the courtroom shall bear witness to my second attempt...!

===Post-DeviantArt===

I have no idea what I'm gonna do now. I'm definitely Leaving DeviantArt Forever™, as I will not tolerate this intolerant banhammering against my good name. But I will never quit drawing. I've been drawing since 1999, before there even WAS a DeviantArt! So I'm definitely not quitting.

Life will go on. As will Life in FCHS. Snapesnogger will still be the main villain of the comic strip. And MDetector5 and Bee Bryant will be added as characters beginning with Season 7 in the fall of this year. Not as allies to Gemma, but rival villains who like to screw up her evil! Because that's funny. And isn't that what a comic strip is all about...being funny? xD

No doubt that when MDetector5 sees this, he'll probably try to get me permab& from here, too. [http://mdetector5.livejournal.com|He is a user here, you know]. But Encyclopedia Dramatica has already made me out to be a DeviantMartyr due to the journal I wrote there. If I am banned from here, they'll just simply add this journal to their article on MDetector5. Essentially causing his plans to backfire. Dumbass. >:|

The LiveJournal community Artists Beware already knows of him 'cuz he tried to rat himself out back in 2007. [http://community.livejournal.com/artists_beware/142461.html|[clicky-clicky! ^^]] Maybe, in light of the fact that he hasn't changed in a year, and that he's clearly strong with the Dark Side of the Force, I should probably go there and rat him out again. xD

I will never forgive either him or RealitySquared for this incident. Not for a while, anyway. As Timbaland said on a song that plays frequently on Q-99, "It's too late to apologize... It's too laaaaate!"

In the meantime, if you want to support me, here's a little bar you can put in your own journals to do so. ^^

[[Image:MDetector5Boycott.gif]]

And here's the HTML code for that image. Just copy and paste the code below. <!-- Used to be a text-box -->
 <img alt="anti-mdetector5.gif" title="Boycott him NAO." src="http://awwsom.home.mindspring.com/anti-mdetector5.gif" />

===Why the Fuck Does He Even Bother?===

A lot of the deviants mentioned in Encyclopedia Dramatica's little series on DeviantArt go to great lengths to censor anyone who says anything bad about their drawings. Snapesnogger is the best example. She will say and do anything just to defend her drawing style. She won't take any constructive criticism. She won't venture outside the box. All for WHAT!?! Just a bunch of crappy snake porn. :|

MDetector5 is pretty much the same. The fact that he blackballed me from a site that I loved like a brother shows that he is willing to do anything to defend his drawing style and his BE fetish art. He lies to people when he says that he is taking their criticism. He stalks deviants. And he's just a general all-out whore. He supposedly is a cartoonist like me and has a comic called n00b and Jim, but he hasn't worked on it since I first met him in 2006! It's just BE fetish, BE fetish, BE fetish, all the time!

<big><big><big><big><big>WHY!?!</big></big></big></big></big>

I do not like inflation art, at all. Especially not TRUE inflation art, which involves inflating the entire woman. I have zero tolerance for fat people. Their lifestyle's putting them at risk for heart disease and diabetes, plus many of them look ugly and gross...they need to lose weight NAO!!! And pregnancy fetish...pregnant women piss me off like you wouldn't believe. Every pregnant woman I have ever met in my life has been a BITCH to me! Fuckin' radical feminists!!! >xO

MDetector5 specializes in BE, which is short for "breast enlargement". When done tastefully, BE art isn't all that bad. But the vast majority of BE fetishists (including MDetector, who thankfully posts the really gross stuff off DeviantArt) expand a woman's breasts to fill the room that I'm typing this journal entry in. That's just...gross.

Yes, I draw MY female characters to have huge boobs...but at least I TRY to make it look natural. There were people I knew in Franklin County High School who did indeed have a rack like Ashley Nikiwawa's. Even the most religious big breast worshipper (meeee!!! xD), who plays the Dead or Alive games, has pictures of Jessica Simpson from The Dukes of Hazzard 2005, and who spends more time talking to a girl's rack than the actual girl, would not like some of MDetector5's BE fetish art.

Indeed, ask the average straight male, lesbian, or bisexual college student in Franklin County, Virginia what he thinks when he sees the perfect girl, and he (or, she, as the case may be) will say something that doesn't stray too far from my idea of the perfect girl: someone my height or slightly taller who either has long, flowing brown hair and green eyes or is Asian. Not someone with really huge boobs or who is a frequent patron of plus-size clothing stores. So why does MDetector5 go to so much trouble to turn a woman into something that she is not, shouldn't have to be, and can't be anyway due to the laws of physics? (If it WERE possible for women to have breasts of the sizes that BE fetishists often like, those breasts would be too heavy for the woman to hold up, causing many health issues including back problems, the inability to sit or stand upright, and, if the breasts became so heavy that they collapsed on the rest of the woman's chest, heart failure!)

The silly thing about his obsession with breasts is that numerous non-scientific studies conducted by St. Clair Publications and others show that breast PROPORTION, not breast size, is what matters most. I spent two years of my high school life in art classes and want to take a few MOAR at Virginia Western...I think I'm an expert on aesthetics. And maintaining balance in that classic hourglass figure is very important. Sure, if you put the average male in front of a picture of Coach Ellington, he might have an erection...but once you shove him in front of an animation in which she and Snapesnogger are fighting with lightsabers at extremely high speeds (typical of a Life in FCHS episode), the big breasts become lost, and the only thing that keeps him glued to the TV/computer screen is her whole body, her clothes, and possibly the battle scene itself.

So, to summarize: proportions, not breasts. How do you think the infamous "three sizes" (the ol' 36-24-36), the measurements of a woman's breasts, waist, and hips, came into being? I even did an experiment on this once (but threw away the results because I never thought I'd be talking about this later, so I can't post 'em here! >_< >_< >_<) where I asked passers-by to tell me which picture was the better one of one of my Promotional Drawings of a busty woman vs. one of MDetector5's BE fetish pieces. The overwhelming majority went for my picture. Flawed anatomy, notebook paper, and all! O_o

I knew about this whole big breasts issue for quite some time even before I did the experiment, because even professional art teachers made fun of me as early as 2003 for having girls with such oversized chests. Also, I've been a big band geek from 1999 to 2005 (I played the trumpet), and I'm heavily into pop music. So I knew about this issue because of the pointless T&A race that occurred in the wake of the Spice Girls' rise to fame back in '97, which led to the rise of a metric fuckton of singers like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, the Backstreet Boys, Avril Lavigne, Hilary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, Hayden Panettiere, and Miley Cyrus, where the record companies focused more on a singer's looks than actual music! This, in turn, caused a bunch of songs to appear with fake vocals, fake lyrics, and fake looks! Apparently, the masses were under the impression that looks, not music, sold, but fortunately, singers like Colbie Caillat and Sara Bareilles are starting to remind the record companies what made them great to begin with.

One of the biggest accusations I made against today's music until very recently was that it all sounded the same. To prove that, I even took CD's of Britney Spears, Hilary Duff, and Miley Cyrus...and a little bit of Madonna for good measure...and played 'em all to passers-by, and asked them to tell who was whom. Only one person got it right. That person was a Hannah Montana fan, but I'm still convinced that he just got lucky. Indeed, it seems that the record companies were so obsessed with making men fap to hot, sexy female singers that they forgot that the girls have to actually...oh, you know, SING!!!...in order to make it big in this world!

MDetector5 is pretty much the same way. He got so focused on BE fetish art, he forgot what truly makes an artist successful. Speaking of which, I still haven't answered the question of why he's gone to this much trouble to defend his drawing style so much?

I have thought and thought and thought about that...and I'm pretty sure that the answer is a simple one: '''HE SUCKS'''.

As I've said before, I have flaws as an artist that are bigger than HIS, but I've always tried to balance them out with my much better (although still flawed) ability to tell a story. MDetector5 may be a great storyteller, too, for as far as I know...but judging solely on his DeviantArt gallery, it seems to me that he has no story to tell in n00b and Jim. For starters, he uses self-inserts. So do I. I'm a star in my own comic strip, which explains the "cheerleader" persona I've taken on teh Internets. But, see, a story that has self-inserts is very difficult to make properly. It's no accident that self-inserts are very rare in the cartooning world. And while I'm sophisticated enough to pull it off, he isn't. Hence the BE fetish stuff.

MDetector5 makes the same fatal error that Snapesnogger made with Red Venom and Angel 1,000: He spends so much time on the fetish stuff that he forgets to develop the characters and comic. As Encyclopedia Dramatica notes in his article, in the section "More on Bee", his characters are rather wooden, and some are caricatures of ethnic stereotypes. Think of the comic strips I've made this past weekend to remember Tim Russert. Think of all the depression and sadness that we are feeling because someone so influential and so close to NBC and politics was cheaply killed on a whim. Now think of the emotional vacuums in MDetector5's world. In addition, he has this strange fetish for Samoans due to his love of The Price is Right...and it's almost as creepy as the Samoan women themselves who still haunt Bob Barker to this day! D:

It is true that Ashley Nikiwawa, despite being originally painted as this combination of everything that is good about Hawaii, has never done a hula dance in her six years as a character, nor does she really do anything else remotely "Hawaiian" outside of saying "aloha" to people and putting leis on everything (in yesterday's Life in FCHS, she put a lei on the grave of Tim Russert!), but you can still feel that vibe coming from her through the occasional reference she makes to her old life growing up in Honolulu.

The point is, though, Ashley Nikiwawa isn't there to be a "token" native Hawaiian or to caricature the Aloha State in any way, like many of MDetector5's "ethnic" characters are. Like every other character, she is made so that if she were real, she'd be just your ordinary, average human.

All the characters in Life in FCHS are very believable and reveal distinct personalities. Even though I can only draw a limited amount of basic emotions, I am still capable of showing well-rounded, multi-dimensional characters. I'm cold, dark, and unfriendly. Brittany Oliver is very bright and happy. Coach Ellington is spunky, but not overly hyperactive like a typical cheerleader or coach. Jenna Ellington is nice and friendly, but has a sadistic edge to her. Jessica Dawson was wild, loud, obnoxious, and rude. And Snapesnogger is extremely arrogant of herself. Even the minor characters have some personality. MDetector5's characters, however, come off as rather vague and nondescript. So, when something is revealed about their personalities, we must take his word for it.

So, this, ladies and gentlemen, is how the BE fetish antics have come into play. He tried to take a hint from the 1970's edition of Match Game and spice up a format that he knew was pretty weak and couldn't stand on its own. The problem is, he got so focused on the BE fetish that he forgot about everything else! It is true that my own characters have huge breasts and wear short skirts and high heels as well, but that's not what keeps you coming back to the comic strip. What keeps you coming back is an enduring storyline and compelling characters. Underneath the sexual factor, you'll find ordinary people just like me and you. And that's just not what I'm finding in MDetector5 or his gallery.
