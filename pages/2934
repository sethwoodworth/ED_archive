Combining different filetypes into a single file, such that the appropriate data is preserved with respect to how the file is being read. This is usually accomplished by concatenating the files together.

== Works with any combination of the following ==
*7ZIP
*JPG
*MP3
*PNG
*RAR
*WAV
*[[4chan.js|HTA]]

== Examples ==
In Windows:
 copy /B foo.jpg + bar.rar foobar.jpg

In *nix:
 cat foo.jpg bar.rar > foobar.jpg

Both of these examples will create a file named foobar.jpg, that when viewed graphically is identical to foo.jpg, but when unrar'd contains the [[CP|contents of bar.rar]].
