[[Image:12_01.PNG|thumb|right| In '''YGO:GX''' Card Games get [[serious]].]]

Possibly the gayest foreign import shown on [[TV]] [[evar]], since the cancellation of "[[shit nobody cares about|Super Henshin TaiChi Seven Guys Fucking Six Guys Action BattleFever team penetration squad StarBeastiality Rangers: Deluxe]]". Yu-Gi-Oh spawned a movie that garnered a 5[[%]] rating, arguably less, on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

==The Plot:==
[[Image:YuGiOh_porn.jpg|thumb|200px|ITS TIME TO D-D-D-D-D-D-D-DUEL!!!!]]
[[Image:KaibaFruit.jpg|thumb|200px|Totally [[not gay]]]]
Yu-Gi-Oh (pronounced [[you]]-[[gay]]-[[whore|ho]] or Yu - [[Sick fuck|Sick - Fuck]], full name Yu-Gi-Ohmygodfuckmyass) is a show based on a card game (which is an intentional ripoff of [[Magic the Gathering]] as shown in the original comic book series) about Japanese people who speak with [[New York]] accents and "[[teh]] heart of the cards, [[lol]]." To begin with, there's a boy with the voice of a 58-year-old by the name of Yugi Muto. He's got some big Egyptian bling around his neck, and he runs around with several [[boi|androgynous]] guys, dressing like a [[gay]] [[BDSM|biker]]. 
Despite having a girlfriend (Tea) with huge [[tits]], all he does is play Tokyo No-Limit Hold 'em Poker. They politely take turns in between hair tossing, power-queefing, and betting their souls on the game. All on the part of the male characters, of course. The occasional sex scene is punctuated by Yami/Atem whipping off his leather pants, screaming "Behold! A power like you've never seen before!" before spooning Tea. Deuces and ginormous fucking monsters and robots are both wild. 

Episode upon episode is spent discussing card strategies and acquisition of the Egyptian GoddCock Rings. They also speak of the Power of Friendship, Friendship being an occult demon who can engulf virgins with his semen in 9.4 seconds flat, technically making it the best sex the virgins have ever had. All of the characters on the show have had sex with Friendship [[at least 100]] times.

*''Season 0 Plot summary'': Little is known about the real 1st season of Yu-Gi-Oh because the [[homosexual|poofters]] in the English speaking world considered it too violent. The series went for several episodes and showed [[Engrish|you how that poof]] [[homosexual|Yugi]] solved the hardest puzzle in the world that took [[atleast 100]] years to solve. This is said by some to be the best series cause that pussy [[13 year old boy]] actually forced someone to shoot and kill themselves, chop of some watch collecters hand, set a guy on fire, and tricking a serial bomber into blowing himself up. the manga was so violent that even the japs had to tone it down (which says alot given its normally "anything goes" in japan anime.)
*''Season 1 Plot summary'': The show introduces Yugi Mutou a [[13 year old boy|high school student that still hasn't hit puberty]] also to be a future [[an hero]] living with his [[Pedo]] Grandpa who runs a game (read as "crack") shop. Yugi has a girlfriend and two boyfriends, who hang around him simply because he's good in the sack. They are known as Tea Gardner, Joey Wheeler, and Tristan Taylor. All of them love Yugi's heart of the cards and his throbbing man-meat. Shit happens when Yugi's grandpa is finally caught looking at [[child porn]] by [[Pedobear|Pegasus]] and taken away to a castle owned by a toon-obsessed pedophile named Pegasus J. Crawford, also known as Maximillion Pegasus. Yugi fights Pegasus for his Grandpa's freedom. Kaiba also joins in to save his brother from the child labor exploiting clutches of Maximillion Pegasus, who is about to send him to [[Africa|the Shadow Realm]].
*''Season 2 Plot summary'': Wanting to prove finally how big his [[cock]] is Seto Kaiba challenges the whole fucking world and Yugi to attend his card game tournament. For instant [[lulz]], Yugi beats him and Kaiba [[Playstation|realizes how much of a waste of time and money]] the card game actually is. 
*''Season 3 Plot summary'': Nobody really gives a shit what happened or who died by this season, except for the most rabid basement-dwelling fans.

==Characters in Yu-Gi-Oh==
[[Image:Yugioh babyfurs.jpg|thumb|200px|The male characters doing what they do best.]]
[[Image:YuGiOh_Hentai.jpg|thumb|200px|No wonder little kids play this.]]
[[Image:Pervert grampa yugioh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Yugi's grandpa sure likes his loli]]
[[Image:Mai_Valentine.JPG|thumb|right| She's also lesbian]]
*''Yugi'': The main [[13 year old boy]] of the show. Since he cannot afford [[Pokemon]] cards, he plays Duel Monsters instead (which is [[over 9000]] times better than [[Magic the Gathering]]). He wears around his neck the Millennium Puzzle, one of the seven Millennium Items and an ancient Egyptian artifact that makes him bi-polar. When Yugi is playing a game or under stress, his inner sadist surfaces and he pretends to be a 3,000-year-old nameless pharaoh, who then takes partial or complete control of the body, especially his [[penis]]. If Yugi was [[bisexual]] this would be his [[gay]], twink side, and ([[bondage]] slave to his alter ego). He is also known to have [[buttsecks|brotherly bonds]] with his best friend Joey Wheeler.
*''Dark Yugi/ Yami Yugi/Bi Polar Yugi'': - The pharaoh Atem who became a [[An hero]] in his previous life. His soul is trapped in "Yugi's Millennium Puzzle" along with some "Millennium" [[crack]]. If Yugi was [[bisexual]] this would be his [[straight]] side.<s> Also known as "The King of Gets" due to the amazing fact that any post on /a/ with Dark Yugi as the picture will end in a 5. Go try it now!</s>
*''Téa Gardner'': - Téa is Yugi's girlfriend. She sucks at playing the actual card game, though that's because she doesn't play it as often as the other [[fags]] on the show because she is too busy sucking [[penis]]. She loves Yugi because he has DID. She gets fucked by his [[straight]] side, and wears a [[dildo]] for the [[gay]] side. 
*''Joseph "Joey" Wheeler'': - Yugi's [[boyfriend]] and the [[bitch]] of the relationship. He is also an oily [[Italian|guido]] faggot who [[rapes]] the English language whenever he opens his greasy mouth. Follows Yugi around at the start of the first season asking him for money to feed his little sister's [[drug]] addiction. He later finds out that duel monsters is [[serious business|serious fucking business]] and starts playing it to win money. Of course though he is still a complete idiot because everybody knows you could make more just selling the damn cards on [[eBay]].
*''Tristan Taylor'': - Yugi's other [[boyfriend]]. He fails at the card game, usually because he's just [[shit]] in general. He had one episode that he dueled in, but that got edited out for the English version because it was too lame. He is madly in love with every girl on the tv show, like Brock from [[Pokemon]]. However, unlike Brock, he also loves every male character.   At least he's [[whore|easily satisfied]]. Tristan winds up falling for Joey's handicapped sister because his standards are that low.
*''Ryo Bakura'': - Bakura is bi-polar, like Yugi.  Physically, he resembles a mop. By day he is a normal school student and [[fag|Hot Topic patron]], transforming at night to become a 3,000 year old spirit that lives in his Millennium [[Cock]] ring, with the power of the cards and [[buttsecks]]. He intends to collect all of the Millennium items [[FTW]].
*''Seto Kaiba'': - The [[Bill Gates]] of the world, and sees Yugi is a threat because his [[penis]] is longer than his. He is the president of Kaiba Corporation, the biggest game company in the world and out for world domination, not unlike Wal-Mart.  He wears a misshapen trench coat in hopes of disguising his hideous disfigurement due to arthritic joints and hunching all day in his computer chair.  Thinks that inventing technology to play holographic card games actually benefits society, funnily enough.    
*''Mokuba Kaiba'': - Seto Kaiba's younger [[gay]] brother. Besides existing, he does a whole load of fucking [[nothing]] except for getting kidnapped over 9000 times. Has plentiful [[buttsecks]] with his brother and Pegasus.
*''Solomon Muto'': - Yugi's [[pedo]] grandfather. Wears diapers.  Lives in a hole under his illustrious game shop.  Only surfaces in hope of secks. A fan of tentacle rape hentai.
*''Maximillion Pegasus'': - Pegasus is the only [[straight]] character in the entire show. He is also the creator of the [[Magic the Gathering]], that is to say [[Pokemon]]...err, [[Digimon]]... or was it [[Dragon Ball Z]]? [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|Oh yeah]], it was Duel Monsters, the game the fucking show is about. He possesses the Millennium Eye that can see beneath your clothes (not unlike Superman), and tries to take over the Kaiba Corporation so that he can use its technology to see his dead wife, Cyndia meaning Pegasus is into [[necrophilia]]. Or perhaps to cyber with 13-year-old boys.
*''Mai Valentine'': - [[Anime]] version of [[Paris Hilton]].  If Paris Hilton were poor and dirty and wore the same clothes every day. Actually just poor. Loves Harpies (more like herpes, [[amirite?]]).  
*''Marik Ishtar'': - Whiny bitch that couldn't get a motorcycle because he had to guard a tomb that was the centerpiece of an [[longcat|ancient prophecy]], which he has burned onto his back. Has a dark side that shoves his [[cock|Millennium Rod]] into places that you [[goatse|wouldn't believe]].  If Ryo Bakura resembles a mop, he would be a feather duster.  His face is made of putty and will stretch without warning.

==Yu-Gay-Ho GX: Generation XXX==
[[File:Scientologysocietyoflight.PNG|thumb|[[Scientology]] is a [[Shit nobody cares about|major]] [[assburgers|antagonist]] in season 2. You know what this means...]]
The original Yu-Gi-Oh! series recently concluded when everybody remembered that the card game was just a fucking fad and laughed at seeing formerly expensive packs of cards at Dollar General.
Recently a spin-off called "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX: Reform School Boys" launched on Cartoon Network, all about people who somehow make a fucking living playing cards, enough of one to have a school about it. Wonders never cease.

In this series, [[gay]] [[13 year old boys]] and some [[black|token]] girls that are only there for the [[tits]] and [[ass]] factor attend a school that teaches them how to play this easy card game. 
Various things try to destroy or control the school, like [[Dicks]] and the students must protect it, because if there was no [[school]] then there would be no plot for the next episode. And everybody knows kids love [[School]].

Now your original Yu-Gi-Oh are discontinued decks are worthless as tournaments will used these cards.

==Yu-Gay-Ho 5Ds: ==
Basically the same crap you just saw, except instead of a backdrop featuring either [[Egypt|Ancient Egypt]] or a [[Harry Potter|Hogwarts]] style boarding school, they play the same bloody card game, on [[Bike|Bikes]].  

Well fuck that now your GX decks are worthless, as Konami will pimp these cards now.

==Actual Card Game,[[IRL]] Strategies and Relevance to the Internets==

===[[IRL]] Card Game===
To go with the TV show, you to can spend/waste money on actual cards from the show. People take this game seriously, and regional tournaments are held for [[13 year old boys]] and [[Tourneyfag|Tournyfags]]. Konami, the people behind the card game also [[Shit nobody cares about|decide to ban cards or restrict their usage in decks]], making pieces of cardboard with Ink on them even more worthless.
The most powerful card in the entire game is [[Shotgun mouthwash]], which is powerful enough to win the game in one turn.


==== [[Fact|Typical Yugioh Game]] ====
|<youtube>sGzGc1-QZUU</youtube>

===Ban Hammer Cards===
Every six months Upper Deck Entertainment likes to fuck around with [[nerds]] who buy their crap, by banning cards that are too gay from being played [[IRL]] tournaments. Over the years this has caused major [[butthurt]] for nerds that call themselves ''Duelists'', because when the finally get that one rare card they have spent 3 months tracking down on [[eBay]], it finally gets the ban hammer up their ass.

===Forum Drama===
Due to everyone in the YuGiOh community having at least two [[disorder|mental disorders]], whenever a group congregates; there will be drama. No exceptions. Some of the notable communities include:
*[[Yugioh Card Maker|Yugioh Card Maker Forum]]
*[[Seto-Kaiba.com]]   

===I'm in your hobby store, weighing your cards=== 
As of [[last Thursday]], a [[Nerd]] who rage quit the game, but before he did he sold his secret for profit. Holographic Cards in Yu-Gi-Oh weigh more then non Holographic Cards!!!1 Who would have thought. Anyway, Holographic cards are worth heaps, but there are only 6 of them in a box of 24 packs of [[crap]]. If you use a scale (the same type a [[drug]] seller would use, of course) and weigh the packs of cards before you buy them in the store (much to the "WTF?"ing of the store manager), you can find which packs contain holographic cards. Buy the heaviest packs and presto, you now have shiny pieces of cardboard!
This surprisingly gives much [[lulz]] though, because the next [[loser]] who buys all the other packs won't get shiny pieces of cardboard (though, you're still a [[loser]] for spending money on this [[shit]] card game in the first place). 

<center>
{{fv|weighcardz|background-color: aliceblue;|font-weight: bold;| <youtube>K80WpD-vA-M</youtube>|<youtube>4uRqZUtyA_4</youtube>}}</center>

In your base, weighing your cardboard! Not like this has any use since most of these cards are priced in the kinds no longer give a shit range.

==Rating==
The series has been so fucked over by 4KIDS that any plot that may have existed is editted out. Yu-Gi-Oh the Abridged Series, however, is an assful of fun for the whole family. 

[[File:Cobain yugi.jpg|thumb|[[Kurt Cobain|Yugi]] contemplates his [[anhero|next move]].]]
===Yu-Gay-Ho=== 
*''Action'': Hot card playin' action! Real paper cuts! Japanese school girls with short skirts! Tiny mouths!
*''Lulz'': No, unless you think that Yami has the same spiky hair for pubes.
*''Regular Gayness'': Go to your school's local ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' club and you get an automatic sex-change as you pass through the door.
*''Furry Gayness'': [[wop|Joey Wheeler]] is forced to wear a dogsuit twice. Self-explanatory.
*''Merchandising'': Buy some fuckin' cards! They're not just ink on cards! They're real monsters, motherfucker!
*''Morals'': The Power of Friendship! It can destroy more than Al-Qaeda! Worth an expired coupon at Roy Rogers! Buy our fucking cards, sheep!

===Yu-Gi-Oh GX: Generation XXX===
*''Action'': Bigger [[boobs]] on teenage girls than on [[your mom]]. Just like the first series, every season ends with the fate of the world depending on a fucking card game, meaning it's [[serious business]].
*''Lulz'': "And this one time at Duelist Camp" is the only [[lulz]] worthy line in the first and second season of this show.   
*''Merchandising'': More ink on cards...I mean monsters, motherfucker! And brace yourself for Elemental Hero Condom-man. 
*''Morals'': More Cards, More Power.
