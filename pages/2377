'''Dr. Hax''' is a [[meme]] created by [[furfag]] [[YouTube]]r DasBoSchitt. It is very very funny, but only if you are [[13 year old boy|13 years old]]. In a nutshell, it is simply the Dr. Breen character from [[Half-Life 2]] but with a [[XBOX HUEG|HUEG]] head, and whenever someone starts using [[hacks|GodMode]], Dr. Hax appears out of fucking nowhere and [[rape]]s that person with a fucking monitor even before he gets [[Valve|VAC]] [[banned]]. Dr. Hax also has an enemy, aka [[Vince|Chuckles the Cheat]]. Then again, [[nobody cares]] about this guy.

Despite how fucking unfunny it really is, Dr. Hax is used again and again in hundreds of [[Garry's Mod]] videos across [[YouTube]].

==Origins==
[[Image:DrHax2.gif|right|thumb|300px|[[Black]] kids are common targets.]]
Dr. Hax was first seen in the first episode of the Gmod Idiot Box by DasBoSchitt. Since it originated from a [[furry]], this is technically [[Shit|a furry meme]].

<center>{{frame|<youtube>t2eUUHkpvQA</youtube><br /><center>'''Dr. Hax, first seen at 1:40.'''</center>}}</center>

A Dr. Hax character is made by simply enlarging the head of the Dr. Breen model, then making him point and shout Hax at someone. DasBoShit [[fanboy]]s are usually found spouting that this is originality and have many [[bawww|comment wars]] with [[NORP]]s because of it. Dr. Hax was soon copied by a bunch of [[retard|his subscribers]] up to the point where people made stuff for it outside of YouTube, such as a HAAAX weapon for [[Garry's Mod]].

The only reason it became a meme was because nobody could actually come up with any [[original content]]. However, [[some argue]] that Dr. Hax is not a meme at all because of this, since it really is just people using the same shit over and over.

===DasBoSchitt Protection Squad===
[[image:Dasbobodyguard.png|thumb|600px|center|You need permishiunz!!1]]
Since all of DasBoShit's fans are total [[fucktard]]s, they all believe that DasBoShit owns the rights to Dr. Hax. Yes, we're talking about the use of the Breen model and the HAAAX sound clip that came out of [[Half-Life 2]]. Even moar, they request that you need permission to make such videos. This is where the '''[[Fantards|DasBoSchitt Protection Squad]]''' comes in.

Every video including Dr. Hax-based material MUST include some sort of homage to DasBoShit claiming how much of a God he is, usually in the form of a disclaimer. If a video does not have a message like this however, the DasBoSchitt Protection Squad will flock to that video and flood it with [[Flame|angry comments]] until the owner of the video adds a hint of fanboyism to the video description.

|But, people should ask DasBoSchiits permision if they want to use Dr. Hax|FAGGOTRY
|}}</center>

To wrap it up, DasBo's subscribers know nothing about the [[Law]] and need to be purged immediately. Unsurprisingly, DasBoShit [[win|hates his subscribers]].

==When to use it==
Dr. Hax should [[Duh|only appear if people are hacking]].

==What Facepunch has to say about Dr. Hax==
Somebody posted a thread on [[Facepunch]] sometime in July 2009 stating they created some new [[lie|totally original]] Dr. Hax video. In return Fagpunch users used their typical rewordings of [[GTFO]]:

<center>{{Morphquote|everyoneloveshax|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|BosSchitt needs to get that shit copyrighted, cuz peeps be steeeeelin.|Some fucktard
|Basboschit needs to quit in my option milking the series and its starting to suck, and I don't want to start seeing cheap knock offs... its like the [[twilight]] fanbase.... I hear mindless idiot gmod followers in GMOD now always quoting that damn series... 
calm down... no more rants... Ive seen the damage a big rant can do...|ScoutKing
|all dasboshitt does is make the community stupider and makes it harder for serious film makers. We already had a surge of random films in 2007-2008 and it just started to tone back down to decent non random films., then BAM he hits us like a bitch, he could at least be like kitty who actually BUILD A FUCKING STORY BASE its like god damn family guy, go off no story line and make random shit happen, to please the low IQ population.|ScoutKing. Actually it's because they suck.
|I wouldn’t say its dead and he’s milking it but naming the skits is kinda dumb. But let’s face it, most “good” garry’s mod movies are random movies, and Dasboschitt pretty much perfected it with his series. It’s better than having hundreds of movies like the one’s Witchita used to make (has he been perma banned? I’m just glad he’s gone)|
|are you really that uncreative that you have to take someone elses idea?
if i were you i wouldnt do something on a character created by someone else.|darius_bielecki

===Facepunch take on the DPS===
Fed up with all the permission bullshit, Facepunch members oppose the DasBoSchitt Protection Squad greatly as shown from their responses to [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k3Orc0x8FY this video]:

<center>{{Morphquote|facepunchvsdps|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|I think it was more of a video that is like "I HAVE PERMISSION TO USE DR. HAX AND YOU DON'T"|The truth.
|[[That fucking cat|If I hear "Hax" one more time....]]|
|Dr. Hacks is as funny as an overused forced meme raped and run over by a [[F40PH|train]]|

==Gallery of Haaaax==
Whenever a member of [[DeviantArt]] turns sub-par (i.e. all of them) they end up only doing memes because it's the only thing they can do.
