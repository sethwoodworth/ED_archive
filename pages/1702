The [[Commonwealth]] is the modern form of [[United Kingdom|The Holy Empire of Britannia]]. This organization is made up of countries which used to be colonies of [[Britain]] and currently still chose to celebrate about being Britain's [[bitch]] at sometime in their history mainly because they citizens are halfbreed. The [[Queen]] of [[England]] is the head of the commonwealth but nobody cares about her opinion anymore, apart from her half-wog husband Prince Phillip who continues to successfully troll coloured people within the Commonwealth to this day.

==Membership==

While being part of the Commonwealth used to mean a lot like having the British Royal Navy patrol your country's waters, it no longer means anything much at all, ever since the [[American]] navy started to take over [[Canadian]] and [[Pakistan]]i waters. It now serve to recognizing that each country writes in proper Queen's English, call soccer as "football", call football as "rugby", play cricket during summer, consider boring opinions of white old men in the Senate or the House of Lords as 'good law', and Westminster-style Parliamentary democracy, except for [[Pakistan]] which wants a presidential system. The royal family doesn't have any influence over any of the counties in the commonwealth due to [[Code Geass|Prince Lulu's Rebellion]] granting independence to all the countries involved in it and letting them have all the rights to self-government, except for [[Canada]] which the Queen has to call a time-out, when Prime Minister Harper has a temper tantrum, and prorogue the Canadian parliament before her majesty's loyal opposition leader Dion, the sissy brother of [[Celine Dion]], cries.

The only reason anyone would leave the commonwealth would be so they can stop playing cricket or field hockey as a national sport and start hunting [[Tamil|wild Tigers]] like [[Sri Lanka]]. Whether the Head of State is some old Brithag that lives in London or some old faggot in their own country makes no difference in anything and changing the name of your country really isn't worth the paperwork at the [[United Nations]]. The other not-really-a-reason "reason" to leave the Commonwealth is if your country has the [[retard]]ed mindset of a [[16 year old girl]] screaming at her parents "YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME! I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT" or think that the game of cricket is well..'gay'. This is basically the reason why [[Fiji]] is suspended/grounded from the commonwealth. Braking international laws is a [[bad]] thing and might get you in trouble. Another thing that is a bad thing is spelling "breaking" wrong. The Commonwealth does it all the time [[for the lulz]], so you might get off free too. No [[black|biggie]].

==The Commonwealth Games==
This sporting event is much like the Olympics except only for members of the Commonwealth. It is very likely the only reason [[Australia]] doesn't become a state of the United States of America. It's not really a competition, it's more like [[an]] hilarious comedy routine where [[Australia]] dances around giving shitty third world countries wedgies and flushing their heads in toilets. You almost feel sorry for the other countries when [[Australia]] kicks their asses, but that's a lot like [[troll's remorse]], it can be cured when you think of the pure [[lulz]].

==The Revolutionary War==
The [[America]]n war of independence was fought so they could escape it as [[England]] used to be a [[serious business]] fucking super power. Now, however, the [[USA]] is far more powerful than the UK much like a [[retard]]ed child gone wild. [[England]] now licks the juicy [[asshole]] of the [[USA]] at every given opportunity officially giving the USA revenge and [[pwn]]age [[to the max]].

=="[[White]]" Commonwealth==
Also known as "Crown Commonwealth Realms" or "[[Britfag]]s" to Commonwealth Republics and rest of the world, are Commonwealth countries that recognize the Emperor of Britannia as their Head of State. These countries include [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] that are typically run by fat white men who are oblivious to the fact that Britannia doesn't need their cannonfod..uh I mean soldiers, cheese, wine, and sheeple anymore since joining the [[European Union|Eurofag Union]]. These people are bound by a common love for trash British soap operas such as "Colon-ation Street" and "London: East Siiide iz da Best". Since realizing it's silly to have a Head of State who lives in a different country not as crap as theirs, they appoint Crown representatives called "Guvnur-Genitals" who are typically from minority groups such as Pakis or Negros and make them do public appearances twice a year: once to announce the date when the Queen schedules to perform her annual Royal flatulence and secondly to sign the Queen's chequebook to pay for the welfare benefits given to the Numbers..uh I mean Natives to [[STFU]] about past grievances rightfully inflicted by Britannia.
