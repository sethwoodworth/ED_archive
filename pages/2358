Doom 3
{{spoiler|It isn't [[battletoads]]}}


'''''Doom 3''''' is pretty much ''[[Doom]]'' with slightly better graphics and less things to shoot. This makes it really not like ''Doom'' at all except that it takes place on Mars with a portal to Hell. You get to fight [[zombie]]s with [[Image:Doom3 logo.jpg|thumb|The funnay logo.]][[moar]] realistic skin textures. The graphics are still [[shit|shitty]] even though its only a few years old. Id designed the game to scare [[13 year old boy|everybody's little brother]] shitless.  Children and nearly anyone below the M rated age for this game is widely known to have [[shit]] their pants playing the game at the sight of the first zombie.


== Gameplay ==
The gameplay is based on running around and shooting [[shit]] like in ''[[Doom]]''. It's dark as the far reaches of the universe but you can't hold your gun and flashlight at once.  Ironically, the darkest pits of hell are better lit than the earlier surface station levels.  [[Lulz]] ensued when mods were created to fix this oversight. The mod assumes simply that duct-tape exists somewhere on Mars.  John Carmack, creator of Doom, has personally denounced this abomination as violating canon and ruining the story.  Id software has sent cease and desist notices to any websites providing this mod for download. The real reason for Carmack denouncing the [[fleshlight|flashlight]] mod, is that it increases the chances of the player catching a rare glimpse of [[John Romero]] [[autofellatio|auto-fellating]] himself in a dark corner of the Mars base.[[Image:Doom3shot.gif|thumb|Doom 3 gameplay]]

The levels all revolve around the following, only changing the textures of the walls and the number of corners, from which the demons jump at you to [[rape]] your [[in the ass|ass]]. When a new enemy is introduced like the Pinky (fucking dog thing) and the Hell Knight (dude on the cover) the developers thought it would be [[Christian furry|extra scary]] if they put in multitudes of them, so they did.
You run into a room, see some ammo and medipaks lighted by 3 different sources of light coming from nowhere in the middle of the room, leaving the corners as dark as always. [[It's a trap|Basically, touch this and all hell is breaking loose]], leaving you with even less ammo and life. This is what the [[Retard|developers]] think is a [[obvious|subtle]] way to [[lie|entertain and scare]] [[you]]. Regardless of the [[lie|well crafted horror]] that this game contains, anyone with any skill can beat the game [[retarded|sprinting around with the shotgun.

Also, the [[fleshlight|flashlight]] does moar damage then the pistol. WTF is up with 
that?!?!?!

==Story==
It all begins on Mars, as all horror shooters do. Some [[You|nameless fucktard of a marine]] gets a PDA, which is a vital part of the game (especially useful for pausing the game when its intense moments cause players to shit themselves). The player will then run through a vacuum, and get to an [[Azn|asian]] who releases [[China|hell]]. Then the player proceeds to go through the facility to whack zombies with the [[fleshlight|flashlight]] and desperately look for that shotgun clip you need. Eventually you'll finish the game doing just that, and be able to [[USI|bask in all your glory]].

==Graphics==
[[Image:Doom3.jpg|thumb|Can't see shit captain.]]
Everything in ''Doom 3'' looks like it's been made of clay, then covered in a layer of Saran Wrap. This is due to the [[What|id Tech 4 graphics engine]]. This graphics engine allowed the game to have [[Booty|bump mapping]], [[Crap|normal mapping]], and [[Gay|specular]] highlighting. These features are what make the game [[Bullshit|super duper awesome scary and realistic]]. This also makes everything be darker than it should be which means the player cannot see shit.  Even with such greatly reduced visibility, the game was designed to only show one enemy at a time so as to not slow down the frame rate. However in most parts of the game the developers [[disregard]]ed framerate issues and thought it would be scarier to fuck with your [[Computer|PC]] and sometimes spawn a shit ton of monsters to rape your ass and framerate simultaneousy.
