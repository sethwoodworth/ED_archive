Redwall
[[File:RedwallAnniversaryCover.jpg|frame|a.k.a RenFest Furries Practice Theocratic Communism]]
Think back to your elementary school [[library|library]]. Picture the shelves lining the walls, the colorful array of book spines, and the [[old|sweet old lady librarian]] who would always help you pick out what to read next, tell your class stories in the rocking chair, and make sure to always let everyone see the [[pix|pictures]] before she moved on. ''(FYI- sheâ€™s probably [[death|dead]] now. Try not to think about that for the sake of the exercise.)'' As a [[child|kid]], it was a world of adventure and promise, where every [[book|book]] was sure to take you on a magic carpet ride to faraway lands while helping you learn along the way. 

Hopefully [[you|you]] know better by now. The library was nothing more than a [[Fanfiction.net|cesspool of literary bile]], a place where the [[suethor|talentless hacks of the writing world]] were free to dump their crappy paperback series about [[furry|anthropomorphic animals]], a notable example being the '''Redwall''' series by [[Britfag|Brian Jacques]].

Since the tales of Redwall spawned nineteen novels, two picture books, an [[crappy|animated]] [[television|television]] show, a [[animu|graphic novel]], and an [[lolwut|opera]], you'd think that the series would be interesting, philosophical, and profound.

'''Well, you'd be [[wrong|wrong]].'''

===The Redwall Universe===

The Redwall books take place in an alternate universe where rodents are the dominant species and it is somehow the medieval times. The title is taken from the main setting of the series, Redwall Abbey. The red sandstone abbey is a peaceful half-[[church|church]]/half-[[Mordor|impenetrable fortress]] where [[furry|fuzzy creatures]] of all shapes and sizes live in harmony as [[communism|comrades]]. Pretty much all of the books take place here. Other surrounding lands include [[shit nobody cares about|the mountain Salamandastrom, the kingdom of Malkariss (formerly the fields of Loamhedge), and the Mossflower Woods.]] 


===The Storyline of Every Redwall Book===
1. Someone writes in a [[Livejournal|diary]]. Everything's cool.

2. The animals are in the middle of preparing a [[food|feast]] when '''SUDDENLY THE [[Jews|BAD GUYS]] [[attack|ATTACK]]!!11!1'''

3. Some of the [[white knight|good guys]] fight the bad guys, and the [[pussy|pussies]] that are too scared or weak to fight will always end up finding a [[horrible|cleverly written]] rhyming riddle by fucking around with the abbey's integrity (i.e. breaking a statue, kicking a brick, digging underneath the building). 

4. The good guys meet some [[nigras|new creatures]] on the way to fight the bad guys, [[rape|work through an initial dispute with]] them, and [[slavery|ally themselves together]]. 

5. Arbitrary "[[The Lonely Island|on a boat]]" chapters, including battle on said boat.

6. Back at the abbey, the [[fags|weaklings]] are scurrying around playing Blue's Clues with their stupid [[poetry|poem]].

7. There's a [[300|huge final showdown]] between the good guys and bad guys. The good guys win, but not before [[fail|a few of the nice characters die]]. This is because [[Pedo|Brian Jacques]] wants the kids to know that he is [[hardcore|hardcore]] and knows about [[IRL|real life]]. Every final showdown plays out the same: Good guys attack bad guy's fortress, antagonist acts badass. Protagonist breeches evil lair, finds antagonist, who promptly flees like a pussy, deeper into his lair. Protagonist chases and subsequently corners antagonist, who begs for his life. Protagonist kills antagonist. Don't believe me? Head to your local library and skim through the last chapter or two. Every one is exactly the fucking same with maybe half of the names changed.

8. [[boring|Back at Redwall, they eventually solve the riddle and that usually helps somehow.]] 

9. The good guys come home and there's a [[orgy|bittersweet reunion]]. Everyone cheers. They finally [[NOM NOM NOM|sit down and have that feast they were planning]]. 

10. Someone writes another diary entry, so [[lie|the story is brought around full-circle and completely resolved]].



===Literary Techniques===

Over half of every Redwall book is nothing more than Jacques rambling on about all the different [[vegetarian|vegetarian]] dishes that his little mouse characters make. So much description is wasted on trying to paint a picture of [[shit|delicious meals]] for the reader that by the time they're done eating dinner, you've already thrown the book into a [[Holocaust|Jewcinerator]] where it belongs. This would be okay if they ate anything other than dirt and twigs. But no, it is apparently the author's duty to spend twenty pages illustrating the many subtleties that can be found in the construction of a trifle. 
*No joke. [[truth|Every third plate of food in Redwall has a trifle on it]]. Or a scone or something. Does anyone even eat those? Ever?
**If him writing about fictional food wasn't bad enough, [[fact|Jacques published a Redwall cookbook]]. I wish I was lying to you. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Redwall_Cookbook I really do].

It was a feast to remember, happiness and friendship enhanced by the best of Redwall fare. Puddings, pies, pasties and cakes were arranged between fruit, berries, and nuts, both fresh and preserved in honey from last autumn's harvest. Salads, breads and soups of every variety jostled for position with trifles and flans. Drogg Cellarhog had outdone himself with his selection of ales, cordials, teas, and fizzes. But the highlight was a great cheese, produced by Filorn, Boorab, Nimbalo, and Gundil.|an exciting excerpt from the book ''Taggerung''
|He cut a large wedge [of cheese], arranging it on a platter with some salad, pickled onions, and a farl of warm ovenbread, and passed it proudly along to Deyna.|an excerpt from the same page of ''Taggerung''
|"We made a new yellow cheese and spiked it with nuts, celery, and herbs, then we soaked it for three days in boiling carrot and dandelion juice mixed with pale cider."|okay this is getting pretty fucking ridiculous}}

==Main Characters/Roles==

===Characters===

*'''Martin the Warrior'''- MARTIN IS MOUSE [[Jesus|JESUS]]. 

Though the Redwall series spans generations, there are a few characters whose names are permanently [[tattoo|tattooed]] in the [[acne|acne-ridden]] back of the abbey's history. And by a few, I mean only one. He has a super long [[cock|sword]], and he is Jacques' sad excuse for a Christ allegory. To solidify this metaphor, characters will often perform [[Satan|Satanic rituals]] to appease the tapestry of Martin, fearing [[disease|widespread death and the loss of their children]] from his displeasure. Throughout the series, it's not uncommon for Martin to appear to characters as a [[ghost|ghost]] in revealing dreams or visions. Without getting into genealogy and shit, he's really the only character who is mentioned in more than one book. 

===Roles===



*'''Abbot/Abbess'''- the [[god|overlord]] of Redwall. The abbot is the coordinator of all the activities in the abbey, but more accurately, the abbot is the coordinator of nothing because [[too lazy|the animals never do anything anyways]]. 



*'''Badger Mother'''- also known as '''Badgermums''', these mutant skunks dedicate themselves to sweepin' da floes and lookin' after da chillens. They're basically the [[mammy|black mammies]] of the abbey, and they live for [[at least 100 years|pretty much ever]]. 



*'''Cellarhog'''- the hedgehog in charge of the wine cellar. [[dying alone|This poor bastard is forced into a lifetime of underground servitude in a cold, dark basement with only the rows and rows of fermenting alcohol to keep him company]]. His favorite hobbies include drinking, being drunk, and [[masturbation|fucking the corkholes in empty barrels]]. 



*'''Skipper of Otters'''- a furry version of [[sex|Hugh Hefner]], back when he was the spokesperson for [[Old Spice|Old Spice]]. This character is guaranteed to always act like a [[prep|prep]] [[jock|jock]] since the only talents he has are [[pirate|sailing]], swimming, [[party hard|partying]], and getting girl otters [[pregnant|pregnant]]. 



*'''Foremole'''- the most special [[retard|retard]] of them all. Every last one of the moles is portrayed as mentally retarded, but it's like someone told this guy he had [[aspie|Asperger's syndrome]], and now he has to parade around as the smartest dumbass of the group. [[win|Fortunately, the animals at Redwall know how to deal with aspies-- the Foremole and his crew spend most of their days slaving in the underground drug tunnels beneath the abbey.]]

==Species==

Brian Jacques appeals to his [[stupid|handicapped]] fanbase by making it super easy to tell which characters are the good guys and the bad guys. All you have to do is look at what species they are, and then [[Rorschach|the magical benefits of black-and-white morality are instantly revealed]]! If they're a mouse, a squirrel, a hedgehog, an otter, a badger, a hare, or a mole, they're a good guy. If they're a ferret, a stoat, a weasel, a rat, a fox, or a polecat, they're pure evil. There are also sometimes birds and lizards, but nobody gives a fuck about them.

==Cybercatmia (aka Saphamia)==

[[File:RedwallTitanicRipoff.jpg|frame|right|250px|Seriously. Request anything. She'll do it, as this picture proves.]]

Okay, so there's some bad Redwall [[fan art|fan art]] out there, but at least it tends to be few and far between. With Cybercatmia, this is not the case. Cybercatmia is a [[dA|devianTARTlet]] who spends her days spewing out request after request from her six loyal fans, no matter how [[sick fuck|sick or ridiculous]] their fantasies may be. What draws the furfags to her is a mystery, as she has absolutely zero artistic appeal, but it could have something to do with her [[attention whore|whining and crying]] about how she's [[poor|broke]] in her journals and all the commissions she agrees to [[prostitute|whore]] out.

She is a university student and is undeniably [[virgin|virginal]]. To provide a reference point, she said that she was highly embarrassed to have drawn this picture (which, surprisingly enough, was a request):

[[File:MiceAfterFucking.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Two adorable mice characters cuddle after a rough night of fucking. SO EMBARRASSING :X]]

===Art Style===

As is the case with most Redwall fan artists, Cybercatmia can't decide whether she wants to outright [[tracing|copy]] the shitty art from the cartoon series or give all the characters a [[animu|kawaii animu reboot]], so every picture she draws makes her rat characters look like Don Bluth and Hayao Miyazaki's half-developed [[abortion|abortions]]. Regardless, she readily hands out these limp, dripping fetuses like Halloween candy to anyone who has an adorable, creative Redwall [[original character|original character]].

Even more [[lulz|lulz]] come from her involvement in the Mossflower film project, a bound-to-fail attempt by a bunch of [[weeaboo|weeaboo]] furries to [[adult babies|continue living their childhood]] by [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|producing and animating their own Redwall movie]]. They are all convinced that they're devoting themselves to some noble undertaking, but [[fact|what none of them realize is that if Brian Jacques had really wanted to license an animated Mossflower movie, he would have already done it by now]]. The Mossflower movie is one of the most overwhelmingly pitiful examples of what happens when fantards work together.
