Echon
[[Image:Echon.jpg|right|The mole himself]]
Echon's job, according to the Denver Post was a [[Basement Dweller|Freelance game designer]] who spent his life pimping out skins, maps and other  [[Shit nobody cares about|nifty things]] for the game [[Gloom]].  Finding out it was him who burned down a couple churches wasn't hard because he dropped his own [[dox]] on his own website back when he was a naive 18 year-old with a full resume that showed he was  "Proficient in Windows 95, 98 and Microsoft Word".  This proves that he is not to be meddled with and can [[Internet tough guy|fuck your shit up]].

==His mommy==
His mom is an old, ugly Christian Church bitch who lurks on religious forums where other welfare users pray to Jesus in hopes that somebody else will pay their rent, bail, attorney's fees, fix their car, feed their children etc.  You are supposed to feel sorry for these people and give them free money because they are unwilling to help themselves.  One could only imagine growing up with such a fucked up religious fanatic parent.  I suppose it could drive anybody to burn down a couple churches.
==Quotes==
{{Quote|"I thought if he went ballistic, I could always out-run him," said the physically fit 44-year-old of the chubby 23-year-old.}}
{{Quote|"You just never know what's going on with people," he said. "But if you told me any of those boys would cause trouble, I would tell you that you have the wrong boys."|One of Echon's mommy's [[Sock puppet|Sock puppets]] who think's her baby is an angel.}}
{{Quote|PJ really is a gentle spirit and so darn sweet and kind and caring and these are not just a mothers words, everyone is saying this.. PJ nickname in Jail is "Huckleberry" He looks like a farm boy, his face looks like a teen and his kindness and sense of humor just dominates the room, He is scared to death, he is worried about his safety and he said, if he goes to prison, he will kill himself and I BELIEVE him.|Echon's mommy}}
Huckleberry may soon become [[an hero]].
{{Quote|Yes, everyone please, please keep praying for PJ - I also believe him when he says that he won't be able to handle prison. Lord I ask that You send Your Son Jesus to be with this child of Yours all through the courts and that You be with the judge and that he be given a sentence where he can be under house arrest..."|Echon's mommy's church shrink}}

It's pretty obvious that he will become somebody's bitch.  House arrest?  That would be such a horrible punishment.  He would have to stay on the computer all the time instead of the 2 hours per month he actually does go outside.
