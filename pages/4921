'''Roger Williams''', also known as '''localroger''' on homosexual hangout [[Kuro5hin]], is an unpublished writer of [[science fiction]] featuring [[Incest|incestuous]] [[pedophilia]]. A resident of Mandeville near New Orleans, he became a [[refugee]] following the destruction of his home and anal virginity in the August 23, 2005 [[Hentai|tentacle attack]] on [[America]], an event which entered the nation's collective psyche as the ''Day of the Tentacle'' (''DOTT''). He is most well-known for getting his teeth fixed in Mexico.

==Pre-DOTT==
Even before his rape at the tips of the tentacle beings, Localroger had always been fascinated by sexual perversion. In 2001, he put his novel ''[http://www.kuro5hin.org/prime-intellect/ The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]'' on the [[Internet]], using webspace donated by [[Perl]] programmer Rusty Foster. It is a work that deals with such issues as the necessity of pedophilia and incest in order to repopulate a planet:

: They had argued about it for more than six years, but when the time came he found himself powerless to contradict Caroline's will. Fortunately she had spoken with Nugget, so his daughter did most of the work for him just as Caroline had done most of the work all along. She explored his body with microscopic fascination, especially his cock which she carefully teased erect. There was little really new for her in all this, since she had seen him fucking Caroline plenty of times. He wouldn't have been surprised, either, to learn she had already been experimenting with Ozark. What was new was that she was fertile, and so was he.

: Working slowly, Nugget completed their incestuous coupling, working her way slowly down his cock just as Caroline had done that first time in California fourteen years earlier. But while Nugget moved with her mother's carefulness and deliberation, she did not possess Caroline's amazing certitude. And she was so small, like a feather atop him, and her grip on his cock so tight. Lawrence found himself responding to her despite his reservations; his body was literally making up its own mind to go along.

: When he came he yelled out loud. He was quite unprepared for its intensity, as if he was a participant in some primitive magic ritual which had unleashed a strange power in him. In a sense, reflecting later, he would suppose that that was exactly what had happened.

==Post-DOTT==
Traumatized by the events of the ''Day of the Tentacle'', Localroger initially blamed the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration for the repeated multi-orifice rape he experienced, decrying a failure to protect him and thousands of other Americans from the sexual invaders. However, in time he began to accept his [[Goatse|rudely reshaped anus]] and tentacle-induced exclusive homosexuality.

In late June 2007, part two of his story ''Revelation Passage'', the sequel to ''The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect'', was voted down by Kuro5hin readers and did not make the site's coveted front page.
Localroger began claiming that malicious users had created accounts with the sole purpose of shooting down the story as part of a conspiracy against him, allegedly led by user It certainly is.[http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/6/27/8526/57508] He started his own website[http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/6/28/21464/2117], [http://localroger.com Localroger.com], and according to him more than 250 people have read ''Revelation Passage'' so far.[http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2007/7/13/204941/860/13#13]

Lately Localroger has been stalking Kuro5hin user Tex Bigballs. However it soon became apparent that his advances were not welcomed by Mr. Bigballs, resulting in a torrent of sexually frustrated bitchiness[http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2007/7/14/2118/08501][http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2007/7/13/204941/860/10#10][http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2007/7/13/21422/7510/4#4][http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2007/7/12/172725/066/6#6].
