'''Parry Aftab''', the self-proclaimed "Angel of the Internet", is a [[Internet lawyer|cyberlawyer]] specializing in privacy and [[trolling|cyberbullying]].  In other words, she's basically the self-appointed [[Internet]] [[snitch|recess monitor]]. She's also a [[fat]] [[stupid]] [[cunt]], and the world would be a better place were she to [[Unrealistic Expectations|get laid at least once]].

Parry also describes herself as being like an elephant in that her personality is so huge that no one person can really see her whole self. Given her physique, the incredible irony of that statement seems to be completely lost on her.

Parry has set herself up to be enemy #1 of [[troll]]s and protector of [[children]].  Ironically, the only time the [[troll]]s ever paid her any attention was when she attempted to [[trolling IRL|cyberbully]] the owner of [http://www.katie.com katie.com] into giving up her domain name so the spoiled [[teenager]] [[cutter]] [[whore]] who stole it to use as the title for her [[emo]] [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525945431/002-6436220-3391202 story] about how she was [[almost raped]] by [[pedophile]]s could use it to "[[GET|Help]] Jew [[Gold|Children]]," otherwise known as "help Parry get her fat, attention-whoring face on Oprah." ''Again.''

The net result is that Parry has finally earned the attention she so desperately craves.  Unfortunately, it's as a [[fat]], intolerant, pro-censorship, [[attention whore]], who [http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=116870&threshold=-1&commentsort=0&tid=95&mode=thread&cid=9892158 doesn't know how to use apostrophes, legal restraint, or a gym].

==Early Life==
Parry was born to a crack whore. She never knew her father, the story her mother told her is that one night she went out and had sex with around 20 black men so that she could get money to pay for crack. Parry was born 8 months later. Because her mother smoked crack,Parry was born with severe autism. In the first grade she lost her virginity to 12 garbage men who worked at the dump, which she lived right next to. when she was 12 a man claiming to be her father showed up at crack shack and made love to her. some say she will use this defense in court when she is brought up on child molestation charges.  

==TL;DR==
'''[[MAN THE HARPOONS]]!'''

On March 31st, 2010, to the delight of [[trolls]] everywhere, [[NBC]] and [[dumbass|Matt Lauer]] did an [http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26184891/vp/36113365#36098485 extremely lulzy "report"] on Internet Trolling.  As melodramatic and full of facts as [[Fox News]]'s exploding vans, this one had Parry chiming in with her great expertise on this "[[Slowpoke|new trend]]".  She's also managed to get even fatter....

As you can see in the video, the stinking slimy Jew[[fail]] is morphing in to a [[Reptoid]].

==Why she is a threat==
People like Parry Aftab are a threat as they wish to restrict the very tool that we use to fight oppressive governments so they can make sure their kids don't get called names on the internet. Parry who instead of reminding children and parents of the parable "Sticks and stones" instead wants to make it illegal to be call people names. Clearly she is [[butthurt|sensitive]] about some bullying in the past, likely due to her enormous girth, her wearing glasses, or wearing that ugly excuse for jewelry. Or perhaps she once used her massive girth [[troll's remorse|to bully others into submission and now seeks redemption]] by making bullying illegal. The latter would be explained by why she has done [[spy|so much charity work for human rights efforts in Moscow after the fall of the Soviet Union]]. 

The real problem with her making internet bullying illegal is this: "if I cannot make fun of people, why wouldn't the next step be I cannot make fun of politicians or government". You might be thinking [[Unrealistic Expectations|"that would never happen, we have enough intelligence to stop that from happening"]]. [[O rly|Oh really]]? Name one time where a censorship about a specific subject didn't blur into multiple subjects over time. You can't can you?

Aftab's idea to protect children from mean people will only hurt them years from now when they can no longer speak freely about the tyranny of oppressive governments or corrupt politicians, but at least your children won't be called sluts or poopie heads or whatever teenagers call one another at middle school.
