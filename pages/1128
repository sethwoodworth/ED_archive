'''Brad McQuaid''' is a former ''[[EverQuest]]'' developer who is now known to be a [[drug]] addict, [[douchebag]], [[Ricer|dirtbike rider]], and creator of the originally-failed MMORPG ''Vanguard''. He could probably also be the [[Michael Jackson]] of [[MMORPG]]s. Except he's alive, was never accused of being a [[pedo]], and was born [[white]].

==''EverQuest'' and Brad==
[[Image:Aradune_Mithara.png|thumb|right|THIS IS MY [[OC]] DO NOT STEAL]]
While he entered the [[gaming]] industry in 1989 when he co-founded MicroGenesis, his rise to fame came with ''[[EverQuest]]''. His early game demos were noticed by [[John Smedley]], a [[Sony]]fag and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpaM_UVD4vI a kickass troll], and McQuaid was soon a developer of a project which became EQ. Shortly after EQ's release, it toppled the subscription numbers that ''[[Ultima Online]]'' had. Many considered him a revolutionary [[god]] of the [[Contra|vidya gaymz]].

He was later immortalized within the world of ''EverQuest'' as his [[Mary Sue|Gary Stu]], '''Aradune Mithara''', a ranger who wears [[Edward Cullen|shining green]] armor.

===[[Christianity]]===
It is interesting to note that McQuaid [[DO NOT WANT|did not want]] [[Satan|demons]] and [[Jesus|angels]] depicted in EQ. He felt that this was because it would allow [[concerned mother]]s to let their [[children]] play EQ because it wouldn't be [[blasphemy]] or something else [http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881650000 inane]. It [http://www.christiananswers.net/spotlight/games/2000/everquest obviously did not prevent the game from being criticized by shocked and appalled Christfags, though.]

{{quote|I am a Christian so this probably goes back to me seeing 'Deities and Demigods' and kind of being bummed about that even though I still play [D&D]. It would have made me feel better if they had not used - or rather, had other creatures that weren't demons.|Brad, on [[Peter Chimaera|you are the demons]];}}

The interviewer [http://www.f13.net/?itemid=562 here on f13.net] even asked Brad McQuaid if he gave out religious [[Jack Chick|tracts]] and offered [[promotion]]s to those who converted. He said [[no]].

===[[Flounce]] Time===
According to [[TOW]], in [[2002]], Brad did not like how he wasn't getting all the [[attention]] anymore since more developers were hired, so he threw a major [[bawww]]fest, and left [[SOE]] to create his idea of the The Vision: an online world that is [[epic]] and [[EVE|challenging]] and has a fuckton of high [[fantasy]]. Since he didn't have [[Hitler]]-esque control on [[EQ]], EQ wasn't it. And so begins...

==''Vanguard'': The Vision==

''Vanguard: Saga of Heroes'' is a [[MMORPG]] which Brad McQuaid often referred to as "The [[Delusional|Vision]]" after ditching [[SOE]] and ''[[EverQuest]]''. He started the project in his new gaming company, Sigil. It basically is EQ with better graphics, except EQ was probably buggy and glitchy on release for a reason - the whole concept of MMORPGs was still fresh at the time. With ''Vanguard'' being released in early [[2007]], it had no excuse. The game was rushed and even had glitches where the user interface would [[WTF|disappear entirely]], rendering [[you]] unable to play the game. Second to the much-more anticipated ''[[Age of Conan]]'' (and later still, [[FF14]]), it was considered the biggest disappointment with [[MMORPG]]s. In fact, GameSpy chose it as [http://goty.gamespy.com/2007/special/26.html Biggest Disappointment of 2007.]

Not long after release, [[SOE]] bought the game, laid off half of the developers, kept the rest, and reworked it into something half-decent and playable, almost making up for that whole ''[[Star Wars|Star Wars Galaxies]]'' fuckfest back in late [[2005]] when they made the game into a simple piece of [[shit]]. Of course, Sigil went the way of [[del.icio.us]] and became absorbed within SOE, no longer Sigil.

===Development: Microsoft and Sigil===
Before [[SOE]] even bought the game, and even before they bought the publishing rights, [[Microsoft]] was going to be the publisher of ''Vanguard''. It wasn't too long before the game's release, since in late [[2006]], [http://www.f13.net/?itemid=562 Microsoft ditched Sigil, and according to Brad himself]:

{{quote|... there was a regime change at Microsoft where they reorganized a lot of their game studios. The people who were in charge of the Vanguard project on the Microsoft side went elsewhere and a completely new group of people were put in place. In that new group of people, the upper management side were also in charge of getting the Xbox 360 out the door. So, the PC games at the time were not receiving a lot of support and I don't blame Microsoft for this at all.|Brad, actually not blaming someone else this time?!}}


===Opium-Riddled Drama===
One of the ''Vanguard'' developers commented on something extremely interesting: McQuaid was addicted to narcotics and only worked on the game for fifteen minutes, which probably caused the game to crash and burn until [[SOE]] nabbed it.

The game designer Vincent Napoli [http://www.gamebanshee.com/forums/gamebanshee-news-73/vanguard-saga-of-heroes-designer-sounds-off-95290.html talks about what roles Brad McQuaid, SOE, and Dave Gilbertson in ''Vanguard'''s development here]. From this interview, we learn that Sigil actually fired the [[veteran]] EQ designers (except one) and said they just "decided to leave." [[SOE]] did not do much except script a few quests in two areas, and hire an artist to come in two days a week each month. The workers at Sigil didn't even know why [[John Smedley]] wanted to buy the bug-infested piece of crap, and eventually Smedley [[rage]]d at Brad because he [[Derp|did not check what he was buying first]]. Brad then disappeared into thin air, thought to have been mauled to death by Smed.

Napoli also talked about Dave Gilbertson, a [[fag]] who took over for Brad's position in being the lead designer of ''Vanguard''. Gilbertson was known for being '''[[What|a complete virgin to video games]]''' - you know, '''[[FUCK|never having played one in his life?]]''' He also kept telling the employees that they were getting raises in attempt to make them keep working. To put it into [[you]]r terms, ''Vanguard'' was eventually made by a bunch of [[newfags]] to the [[video game]] industry, aside from the designer.

{{quote|Brad Mcquaid didn't do [[Shit|****]]. ([[Duh|News Flash?]]) He's had an [[Drug|opiate addiction]] for years now, which only got progressively worse as the project failed. His cumulative face time with Sigil designers in the most crucial final years of development? Approx: [[No more than 99|15 minutes]]. And some of the time was spent begging for legitimately acquired narcotics (Or in times of desperation, jacking them from people's desk).|Napoli, on McQuaid doing opiates and stealing cigs;}}

But really, what is it with [[EQ2Flames#LFG.27s_Meth_Problem.2C_and_JesusOwns.com|people associated with MMORPGs and doing a fuckton of drugs?]]

==''EverCracked!''==
The Jace Hall show unveiled their '''''EverCracked!''''' documentary trailer on June 10, 2009 - at exactly '''1:14''', Brad McQuaid makes an appearance, wearing an Alpinestars T-shirt like a [[13 year old boy]]. This led some to believe that he'd resurface soon, and wonder what gutter Jace Hall found him laying in.

==He's baaacckk==

[[Image:Brad_mcquaid_bike.png|thumb|right|VROOM VROOM MOTHERFUCKER]]
On Sunday, June 14, [[2009]] he returned...

His site, [http://www.bradmcquaid.com/ bradmcquaid.com], was updated and the blog was started. He mentioned that [http://www.bradmcquaid.com/Brad_McQuaid/Blog/Entries/2009/6/14_Vanguard__Saga_of_Heroes.html ''Vanguard'' had a very rocky launch, and most people quit before they reached level 4.] McQuaid then went on to mention the game's 14-day trial offered by [[SOE]] and how they did a lot of [[work]] on it.

Later that same day, he [http://www.bradmcquaid.com/Brad_McQuaid/Blog/Entries/2009/6/14_Where_the_heck_have_you_been.html posted another blog entry.] He mentioned how he shouldn't have ditched Sigil when ''Vanguard'' shipped and should have been present at the transition to [[SOE]] and the lay-offs.

More blogs were posted, mostly dealing with [[Dream Theater]], ''[[Star Trek]]'', and other [[nerd]] topics. Meanwhile, [http://www.massively.com/2009/06/16/brad-mcquaid-returns-to-pimp-vanguard/ MMO fans were speculating what douche-move he'd pull next].

===IMPOSTOR?!===
[http://www.thegrouchygamer.com/?p=185 The Grouchy Gamer] (no relation to the [[Irate Gamer]] or the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]]), along with a few other curious [[nerd]]s, discovered something: the domain was actually registered by some [[Subeta|Keith]] guy. The Grouchy Gamer commented that this blog had a different writing style, him taking the blame for the ''Vanguard'' shit, and the different registration could possibly mean it was a [[troll]].

====Brad Clarifies====
{{quote|As for why bradmcquaid.com is registered to Keith, heâ€™s a good friend of mine who snatched the url for me a while back so no one else would get it.|Whatever you say, [[Cool story bro|bro]].}}

==The Future==
Currently, not much is known about Brad McQuaid and what [[Lolcow|antics]] he'll be pulling in the future. [http://www.bradmcquaid.com/Brad_McQuaid/Blog/Entries/2009/6/29_Vanguard__Post-mortem_Part_1.html He talked about what he fucked up with ''Vanguard'' once again], starting with the fact that Sigil should have gotten everything in writing. Oddly enough, he uses "we," "our," and other words suggesting that he is taking some of the blame for once. Maybe he stopped with the drugs? [[Troll's remorse]]?

One thing's for sure: he has brought the MMO community [[lulz]] the size of [[Russia]].
