Edit war

[[Image:NO_U.png|thumb|right|Talk pages of Edit Wars articles summed up in one [[Image Macro]]]]
An [[edit]] [[war]] is where the unfunny, chronic masturbators, and other wiktards get their kicks. Insisting that their version is the 'right' version, or hiding personal vices from the public, or other such faggotry, edit warriors will often try their best to ensure that their edits prevail, often by calling on [[SysOp|friends]] to assist them, or engaging other edit warriors in places other than wikis. Edit wars can be reduced to childish "Yuh, huh!" "Nuh uh!" battles, in which nobody wins until a parent - or in this case a mod - gets involved and arbitrarily declares a winner, just so that the general retardedness of an edit war can be escaped by users who have genuine lulz to post.

==How do I fuck with TOW?==
If for some reason you wish to jump into this shitstorm for the purpose of generating [[lulz]]:
* Find an article with two [[fags]] engaged in an edit war
* Pop in on the talk page and say something like "Oh hai, i herd you like 3RR?" (3RR is a TOW rule [[shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about]], basically you're not allowed to revert the same article more than thrice)
* Immediately go to the admins noticeboard and report the article and both fags
* Drama ensues

==Subjects==

A picture of '''[[poo]]''' was the subject of a large edit war on [[TOW]].

:"Revert wars, alleged sock-puppetry, and page protection: should the article on [[Wikipedia:feces|feces]] include this picture of a large human turd? As of early July 2005, the discussion on this issue alone had reached 12,900 words."

Be sure to read the [[Wikipedia:Image:Human_feces.jpg|image description]].
