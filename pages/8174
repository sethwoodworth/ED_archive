The Dark Knight IMDb Board
{{Spoiler|!  Rachel dies, Gordon dies, Joker is in jail, Gordon comes back to life, Dent murders people, Batman kills Two-Face, fake Batmen in it!!! There is also a rather sad scene in which Two-Face falls twenty feet to his death. For a PG-13 film, the death is shown in a rather graphic format -- as Harvey/Two-Face falls to the ground, the scene changes abruptly to slow motion. We see Harvey's head hit the sidewalk with sudden impact. The speed of the film reverts back to normal and we see Harvey/Two-Face's head explode from the massive impact with the sidewalk. Blood and brains splatter all over the place. The camera pans back from the remains of Harvey/Two-Face and we see that the blood forms the symbol of a bat. This is symbolic for two reasons: 1. It shows that Batman killed Harvey/Two-Face. 2. It's put in the film solely for the purposes of artsy-fartsy douchery.}}

[[Image:The_dark_knight_crap.PNG|thumb|So much for the number one movie in the world, it lost out to Sex and the City]]
Geeks rejoice! "The Dark Knight" (the latest movie about [[virgin|Batman]]) is the Best. Thing. [[Evar]]. The act of discussing it only makes life worthwhile. Nothing compares to it --not even [[sex]]. 

To discuss such metaphysical event that is this movie, without carnal desires of any kind, you should go to The Dark Knight IMDb Board.

Much like the boards on [[300]] and [[Star Wars]], TDK IMDb Board is 
a shithole in the form of a concealed forum. If you're not a [[geek]] (and you have my congratulations) stay away from it. 

This pit full of [[fanboy|comic-book experts]] has a new topic every two seconds (this is still the case despite this film being nearly 2 years old). The [[virgins|fanbois]] type frantically with their chubby, sausage-like fingers, twiddling away on the keyboard. They have complete disregard for orthography or life itself. It should be noted that the movie's tagline, ''Why so serious?'' (Alt. spelling while [[fapping]]: Why so seriouos?) has become a signature line, a [[nickname]], a [[password]], even a [[meme]], but worst of all, a secret salute for geektards everywhere.

Of course you can't criticize TDK, nor the trailer, nor the director or even the guy who plays Alfred. [[You]] can expect this drama and more shit to keep up until the next sequel gets released..

== A message to the TDK board==

In all truth you are stupid to claim wars on other boards when you have two posts a second and most of your threads are off topic and nasty. Maybe you Dark Knight bitches are so intent on causing trouble because your offline lives are so fucked up, so unjust that "THE BAT" himself has recruited you to cause chaos because 'it always gets darkest before the dawn." <S>Really people get a fucking life and just go watch the goddamn DVD release for the 87th time or something!!!</S> Go kill yourself, this movie is pretty fucking shit.

Put away those black tights, take care of your kids and your wife. Or better yet get a decent job that prohibits you from being on the computer so much. Scrub your ass and wash that yellowy green dye out. Buy a business suit that doesn't make you look like a cheap pimp (excluding all forms or purple). Stop saying that everyone reminds you of your father and " you hated your father). If you hated pops so much then A) you were a spoiled brat, B) daddy didn't cough up enough cash to pay for your extra screenings of this film, or C) you were born in the hoodz. Answered yes to any of those choices and no one cares to help you. IT'S A DOG EAT BAT WORLD BITCHES!! The entire public knows that The Dark Knight is box office gold so chill out batties. You are suppost to promote justice not paranoid rebellion.

DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCK!

==Enter Pimptaddyone, ruining the movie for everybody==

[[Unwarranted Self-Importance|Just after an IMDb user named Pimptaddyone]] ([[Sarcasm|who definitely doesn't have an encyclopediadramatica account]]) [[Fap|watched TDK]], instead of hanging out with some IRL buddies, he went straight to his keyboard and ruined the experience for everybody. Some details below: 

[[Image:Im_kind_of_a_big_deal.jpg|thumb|Pimptaddyone is [[Disorder|kind of a big deal]]]]

*''[[Shit nobody cares about|The Joker, a Oprah's new protege, reveals himself asking Batman to take his bra off or he'll start killing people. He says he does it for the mob: he wants their money back, and in exchange wants half of Batman's bra for himself. The Joker kills some people using big ass stones and small bras as slingshots, but decides to go higher and kidnaps both Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent: Batman has to decide which one to save -- Rachel, who sleeps using Batman's left breast as a pillow, or Harvey, who sleeps using Batman's right breast as a pillow.'']]

*''[[Shit nobody cares about|As part of his plan, Joker gets captured by the Justice League of Bras; batman rushes to Rachel to save her, but the Joker has lied, he's not an A-cup but a Double D! Batman ends up saving Harvey Dent, who loses his mind completely when he discovers that not only Joker escaped with his favorite bra, but has set on fire the bra and the police building.'']]

*''[[Shit nobody cares about|Joker announces that the Mayor has to die, or he'll blow up Gotham's giant blow-up doll that is lying conveniently on the rooftop of Gotham Hospital. Dent decides to hunt down anyone who was involved in Rachel's bra burning, and kills people too using a gun loaded with bullets made from compressed bras: he finds Macaroni and kills him, just after Macaroni (worried about Joker's increasing bra size) has said to Batman where to find the Joker. Meanwhile, the clown blows up the blow-up doll that looks like a hospital with Batman on top'']]

*''[[Shit nobody cares about|Now Joker actually runs Gotham City Bra Inc., so he tells people that they have to deal with only A-cups and nothing else. If they can't hadle it, then they can leave. Two giant bras of pepole leave the metropolis: one full of criminals, and one full of innocents. Joker stops the bras and announces that he'll blow both the bras up at midnight, unless one bra blows the other up (they both have inflators).'']]

*''[[Shit nobody cares about|Dent finds Commissioner Gordon, who got corrupted (but is still "a good bra size") and inevitably led to Rachel's bra-nap. Dent threatens him with his bra-gun, but Batman arrives and dives him into a bra in the floor, apparently killing him. Then Batman decides to go on the run: he wants to pretend he took the bras of the people Dent bra-napped, because he thinks Gotham needs it's ex-D.D.'s bra untarnished and unsoiled.
'']]

*''[[Shit nobody cares about|Meanwhile, Joker has failed, and he goes in plastic surgery looking for a bigger cup size. The End???'']]

*''[[Shit nobody cares about|The question marks at the end of the above statement are a hint towards THE RIDDLER! OMOLOLOLZOLZOLZOLZOLZ!!!'']]

HAHAHA <S>Disregard</S> I [[Disregard|sucks cocks]].
