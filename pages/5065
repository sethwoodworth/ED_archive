'''Mixed Martial Arts''' aka '''MMA''' is a [[fetish|sport]] in which competitors try to [[rape|force submission]] or [[Mike Tyson|knock out]] their opponent.  It was originally invented so big bar brawlers could beat the shit out of karate kid nerds who think [[unrealistic expectations|45 minutes a week of calisthenics from their fat, ponytail-wearing sensei in a mall will give them uber ninja skillz]].  Fortunately rules have been added to increase the amount of hugging and testicles to the face, since the only people who watch are closet [[homosexual|footfags]].  The typical MMA fighter wanted to be a professional football player but wasn't good enough so used his high school wrestling background and a bunch of steroids to become a "fighter."

==UFC==
''Ugly Fags Cuddling,'' or ''UFC'', is the biggest and best MMA organization in the world.  The UFC has adopted rules which maximize the man-love and has the best dry-humpers in the world, like Jon Fitch and Gray Maynard.  Fighters in the UFC are so shitty that a former pro wrestler who couldn't make it in the NFL became their heavyweight champion in only four fights.  [[John McCain]] trolled them by [[b&|banning]] them from 36 states and getting their [[old media|TV]] deal yanked.

==Pride FC==
''Pride'' was an organization that tried to find the best fighter in [[Asia|the world]], and (obviously) to promote gay pride in [[Japan]]. Once it was a beacon of [[awesome]] for allowing [[Curb Stomp|head stomping]] on the ground, a 10 minute championship round, and a look the other way regarding [[drug|drug use]].  It was bought by the UFC and disbanded because their rules discouraged hugging and teabagging by allowing knees to the head and face-stomps.
