Eat attack

Whenever a human being who is so [[fat]] that he or she is confined to a battery-operated wheelchair, looks at you achingly, and licks her lips as if you are a Little Debbie snack cake, you have approximately 5 seconds to live before you are consumed.  This is just one example of an eat attack.

Eat attacks are sometimes used for entertainment in the form of an eating contest. This practice, first employed by the ancient Romans, has been a popular excuse for [[Fatties]] to be even more disgusting, all the while claiming that they are "In training".
