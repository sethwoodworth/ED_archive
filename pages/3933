I resurrected this pearl from page 10

[[Image:Whenafaggotsaidit.png|right|thumb|260px|[[Anon]] gives a concise explanation as to the origin of this [[faggotry]].]]
It's common knowledge that /mu/ is the easiest [[4chan]] board to troll. A casual glimpse of the frontpage reveals an endless ocean of butthurt bickering over [[penis|NMH]], [[butt|Radiohead]], and who's the more ''authentic'' of [[buttsecks|the two]]. So it came as a shock to /mu/tants everywhere when an anon decided to save a thread from extinction, proclaiming '''I resurrected this pearl from page 10'''. This stood out like a nigger at a black metal concert. Suddenly it caught on, and every image of a plane flying over a sea reappared on page 1, with that witty line, or a variation thereof (eg. ''I resurrected this smooth lustrous round structure inside the shell of a clam from page 10'', or ''I rescued this piece of shit from page 7''). It's not currently known if the [[cancer]] has spread to other boards. Only time will tell.

One popular game is to create a new version of the original phrase, and then allow others to swap the words around. Example: I rescued this dog from a storm drain → I stormed this dog from a rescue drain → I drained this rescue from a dog storm. This results in much [[lulz]], before being swiftly deleted by a [[Internet Asshole|Mod]].
