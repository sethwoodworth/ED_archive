[[Image:Harrumph.png|thumb|right|Disagreeing clones]]
Harrumph is a small meme on 7chan from the show [[crap|Frisky Dingo]]. The clones are made from Stan, a board director who used the clones so he can control the company. They can only spout the phrase "Harrumph!". [[7chan|7channers]] usually use this phrase to show displeasure with a thread or opinion; it is sometimes used to mock others who are taking things too [[serious_business|seriously]].
