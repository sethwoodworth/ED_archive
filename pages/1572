'''Christopher Walken''' is an actor of immeasurable talent who nonetheless has become a [[Pop Culture]] icon because of his [[batshit crazy|casual weirdness]] and lulzy mannerisms.

==Biography==
Walken is rumored to have been spawned from the collective unconscious of Queens, New York on March 31st, 1943, and he appeared as a young kid on television, much to [[shotacat]]'s approval.  His first movie was a [[sick fuck|Woody Allen]] movie, before Allen married his daughter and caused [[lulz]] in Hollywood.  Walken then appeared in [[at least 100]] films although for a total of fifteen minutes average for each movie.

As for [[teh]] [[Internets]], Walken was inadvertently responsible for the [[old meme]] known as "more cowbell" because he was unfortunate enough to have to utter it [[at least 100]] times in an overrated SNL skit. Now the said [[meme]] is heard constantly as a [[faggotry]] indicator second in popularity only to rainbows and [[Europe]]. Another plague upon the [[Internets]] rests on the shoulders of [[fanfic]] writers (mostly [[goth]] and [[emo]], filled with [[angst]] even in their thirties). Many of these people dwell within [[LiveJournal]] and [[IMDB]], as well as outside Walken's house at 3 a.m. spraypainting pentacles on his front lawn. Fans consider him [[an hero]] and will sacrifice you to the [[rape spider]] if you dare mention "Heaven's Gate", "Gigli", et al.   

He is quite notorious for appearing in the middle of the movie and making you say ''"Holy shit, that's Cristopher Walken!!!!11!!1"'', and is rumored to be a good actor. This is up for much debate though, because nobody can tell for sure as he never usually appears for more than 5 minutes. Also, most of his movies tend to be pretty bad, as he is often called in at the last minute to appear in said bad movies when the studio gets desperate to save their [[POS]] movie. He rants about random things for awhile and then saunters off camera.  He is therefore listed in the '''Hollywood Book of Reference''' under "Emergency". His acting style is to keep the same stonefaced expression the entire time he's on screen, and adding huge emphasis on completely random syllables while sometimes pausing for several seconds in the middle of a sentence.

He has a house in the town of Wilton, Connecticut which is infested with yuppies and emos. He offers plenty of lulz by answering the door wearing underwear and shooting candy out of a BB Gun at kids during Halloween. Basically he's batshit insane.

In 2008, Walken unsuccessfully ran for President of the United States and was officially sponsored by [[General Mayhem]].

Good friends with [[noone]].
