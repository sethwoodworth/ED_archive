The JLU is bunch of fifty-year old, morbidly obese furfags that spend all their free time rallying the fags of ''[[Second Life]]'' against the [[Patriotic Nigras]]. They should be [[troll|griefed]] constantly and consistently, for the maximum lulz. They also [[yiff]] with [[furries]] nightly, and develop anti-griefer tools and ingame sex toys in order to boost the dong-based game economy. The founder, leader and most active member is [[Gene Turnbow]], known as "Kalel Venkman" (i.e. Kal El, [[Superman]]) and possibly other names.

== Activities ==

[[Image:MootykipsJLUDox.jpg|thumb|right|[[User:mootykips|MOOTYKIPS]] IS [[Jake Brahm|JAKE BRAHM]]]]

The JLU loves to flit around ''Second Life'' dressed as super heroes, attempting to "help" landowners who are in trouble and in the end actually aggravating the situation. They frequently wear shielding and use push weaponry, and have these annoying little bots with them called Brainiacs, which they use to access griefer data in a central database, even though its mostly all wrong and fucked up. In their spare time, they hold midnight orgies with the [[furries|furfags]] at FurNation.

As noted above, they spend most of their time jacking off to the activities of the PN. They have at least one member infiltrating the trolling group, but they usually concentrate on planning their next furfag yiff orgy and acquiring new dongs (like other SL residents). When the JLU DOES gather intel, though, it is a shoddy, disorganized lolfest to behold. Unfortunately to the JLU, their network security powers failed them miserably, allowing a random nigra to visit their old wiki with IE7 and be logged in automatically as the last user who logged in without any prompting whatsoever. This allowed the PN to gather an enormous archive of their [[pwned|secret]] wiki of [[troll|griefer]] knowledge, scripts, SL tech, JLUfag names, and other shit. They eventually moved the wiki elsewhere and improved the security. Slightly.

== Notable Fags ==

=== Carigorp Matzerath ===
[[Image:Justice League Unlimited2.jpg|thumb|right]]
[[Image:Justice League Unlimited.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''''IRL SPOTTED'''''

One of the brains of the JLU's spy operations, he infiltrates troll groups in ''Second Life'' and gathers shoddy intel for the JLU and pukes it onto their wiki for them (URL is below). He seems to spend more concentration on the nightly orgies, though, and perhaps gaining Maldavius' old spot.

And nothing is lulzer then finding out RL information about Mr. Batman Fag. Thanks to Nigras like Bevanz and nigra tech. We were able to lurk and lulz up Carigorps MySpace and emails in late April when we found out he was a spy.

=== Sean Petit ===

Uptight little green asshole dressed up like a Green Lantern. Probably due to the wedgie the suit gives him, or (more likely) the fact that he has no life and spends most of his time fucking around in a shittily made virtual world failing to save said virtual world from griefers. Lulzworthy Sean hissyfits coming soon!

=== [[Fat|Kara Timtam]] ===

Fat presumably 60-year old woman who dresses up as the slim Supergirl to escape her horrid reality. In real life, she has a large basket of babies next to her computer desk on which she dines while harassing poor [[nigra]]s, supplied by an adoption center in town and her trips to the mall. In ''Second Life'', it has been confirmed that she is a [[admin|Linden]] in addition to JLU, probably by threatening to shit in Phillip Linden's IRL pool.

=== [[Shit|Fenix Harbinger]] ===

Also fat, presumed to be the grown-up record breaking piece of shit taken by Kara when she realized she was fat and ugly. Now a musician in Dublin, Ireland, by the name of Lynn Cunningham.

=== [[Dyke|Kara Foley]] ===

Mini-Timtam, this self-professed dyke dresses as Power Girl and eats the pussy of Rainey Paderborn alias DianaPrince Carter. Her real name is Jean, and she lives in Hackettstown, New Jersey.

== Failures ==

=== Bima Escape ===

[[Image:SPEECH2.jpg|thumb|right|Bima Escape fagging, spying, and typing all cool as he spies on the nigras as Earth Balliner in the last known major Fort LongCat.]]

JLU love spying on the PN, which is an understatement on the scale of "pedos like kids".  They haunt their IRC channel, lurk their forums, follow them in-world, try to document real-life addresses (OMG STALKERS LOL) and hide in ventrilo.  However, one night, the PN struck back.  

Bima Escape was a long time PN member, who had participated in many raids and had been decorated with a few honors. However, one of the PN grew suspicious and decided to check his email address, an lo and behold, it contained the name of a known JLU member, "carigorp". Bima's PMs were sifted through and his password obtained, and eventually, his emails were read. In his inbox was the one piece of evidence that confirmed that he was a JLU spy:

{{Quote|Hello. My Second Life name is Bima Escape and Angel Fluffy told me that I should inform you that my account is undercover as a spy infiltrating the [[Patriotic Nigras]] group and the groups that stem off of it. He said that I needed to let you know so that my IP/MAC doesn't get banned. So, feel free to send me an email or IM if you have any questions or concerns for me. Thanks. -Bima|Bima Escape|in his personal email inbox lulz.}}

He was [[Ban|B&]] and found to be Carigorp Matzerath, a high ranking JLU faggot. With a little password guessing, his ''Second Life'' account was pwned and his spacebux removed, and the JLU bases completely destroyed. PN partied hard for the next few days with the account before Linden Labs returned it.

=== Maldy Fagtree ===

Maldavius Figtree was also a high-ranking member of the JLU and a <s>Aussie</s> califag, making his way up the ranks by sucking off the head honcho every day and cleaning his personal toilet with his tongue. He also apparently spied on the PN, mostly lurking in IRC between playing his master's skin flute and fucking around in the Woodbury University sim.  He soon gained build permissions in the sim and fuck permissions in the sim owner's (Tizzer Foxchase) bed. 

However, one fine day, Figtree's built-up immunity to Superman's toilet could not save him. Superman had a bad case of diarrhea and Figtree had caught it from him. He went to Woodbury and completely trashed it, literally turning the sim upside down before being b&. He was then summoned to JLU HQ where he was whipped by Superman for compromising their operation. He then bit Superman's dick and was kicked out. He now works alone and cries himself to sleep.

He is also known to post to the ''Second Life Herald'' as Witness X, denying this, despite evidence to the contrary.

=== Pierce Kronos===

Former high-ranking member of the JLU, kicked out for sucking all the right cocks at LL. Aree Lullibub is his beard but even the JLU are not dumb enough to fall for that. Secretly envies Kalel Venkman, dresses as Tizzers Foxchase.

== The Blue Lanterns ==

The Blue Lanterns are the same as the JLU except they are sorry knock-offs of the green lanterns.*UPDATE* The bitches have moved their base into the air above their previous location Greif the area 2x harder because of this.

=== Main targets ===

Nomad Parx- Leader


WriterOfPoetry Oceanlane- Leader's Bitch

=== 12/14/08 nvr frgt. ===

On this day members of the PN griefed the hell out of the BLC at the Aftermath region And Blc base at the Bellatrix region.

=== <s>OH MY GOD THEY'VE GOT A WIKI!!!!</s> JLU failing at trapping people ===

<s>go to blcdatabase.wikia.com and spam the hell out of these faggots</s>
