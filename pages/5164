Manhunt
[[Image:Manhunt-2-banned-lg.jpg|thumb|You will definitely be [[Drugs|tripping balls]] when you play ''Manhunt 2''.]]

{{Spoiler|the main characters in both games go fucking [[batshit insane]]}}

<b>''Manhunt''</b> is the biggest [[troll]] and [[attention whore]] in videogaming. The only people who actually enjoy playing this [[Shit|refined and elegant example of the third-person slasher sub-genre]] are [[Sick Fuck|sick fucks]] who get off on pretend murder. The game caused overwhelming levels of [[butthurt]] amongst [[Yuppie|parent groups]] and has been the subject of [[Bawww|reasoned and objective debate]] in the world's [[Fox News|news media]]. In fact, the drama went so far that the game has been banned in some countries ([[New Zealand]] and [[Germany]], but what do you expect from a bunch of [[Bestiality|sheep-shaggers]] and self-hating [[Hippies|Neo-Nazis]]?) [[Concerned Mother|Parent groups]] in other countries have tried getting this game [[Banhammer|banned]] off of the face of the Earth, causing holier-than-thou [[Walmart|retailers]] to remove the game from their shelves.

Sadly for them, no [[Basement Dweller|would-be ''Manhunt'' player]] goes outside their house to get stuff and the game is still easily available from [[The Pirate Bay|torrent websites]].

==Storylines==

[[Image:1_22_manhunt2_shot.jpg|thumb|Oh yeah, that's a [[Hell|mental hospital]].]]

In the first <i>Manhunt</i>, the player takes the role of one [[So cash|Johnny Cash]]. Johnny Cash is a [[sick fuck]] who is sentenced to death for [[Shit no one cares about|murdering some people]]. Of course Johnny had [[Idiftl|great reasons]] to kill the people. Shortly after receiving his lethal injection, Cash wakes up and finds out that the executioners [[Masturbated|pumped]] [[Shit|apple juice]] into him so that he may have [[South Park|extreme apple juice farts]] later on in the game. A creepy old man named Starkweather yells at him through a loudspeaker to put in an [[FBI|earpiece]] so he can continue to hear Starkweather's [[Your Mom|excessive nagging]] throughout <b>the whole game</b>. Starkweather explains that he is an [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|underground movie director]] who wants Cash to [[Camwhore|perform]] violent acts for the [[Porn|enjoyment]] of his patrons. The game features a grain filter and John Carpenter-esque sountrack to enhance the feeling of a [[Youtube|gritty IRL snuff movie]]. After they have unleashed the [[lollercaust]], the player will have to fight [[South Park|Manbearpig]] and take his chainsaw. Finally, the player goes into Starkweather's office, slices his guts up, and makes his [[Shotgun Mouthwash|head explode]]. The End.

''Manhunt 2'' deals with a more [[Psycho|psychopathic]] storyline. You play as another [[Joseph Fritzl|sick fuck]] who has two personalities and killed his [[Bitch|wife]] for the [[Lulz|fun of it]]. Throughout the game, the main character tries to find out who he really was before the killing. He finds out that he was a complete [[pussy]] and realized that killing his [[Bitch|wife]] was a blessing. The storyline does not really [[Wut|make any sense at all]], but the gruesome murders that occur throughout the game make it so that the story does not matter.

==Violence==

(See? This game makes Rockstar's previous video game troll [[Grand Theft Auto IV]] look about as violent as motherfucking Tetris.)


''Manhunt'''s only [[Special|unique]] gameplay feature is its [[Fail|exquisitely]] detailed [[3guys1hammer|execution scenes]]. These scenes range from [[Fetish|suffocating someone]] with a plastic bag all the way to whacking someone's head off with a baseball bat making all of the "[[Brain|head goo]]" go all over the walls.

In ''Manhunt 2'', the player can actually <b>[[Win|act out]]</b> the executions with the Wiimotes. ''Manhunt 2'' however succumbed to the [[Anti-lulz|enemies of the lulz]]. Since the executions were [[Lie|way too violent]], [[Jews|Rockstar]] had to put in censorship which completely [[Rape|raped]] the fun of killing someone in the game. Giving someone a swirly in the toilet and then bashing their head in with parts of the toilet is not [[I came|satisfying]] enough with the [[Communism|censorship]].

==''Manhunt 2'''s Censorship==

[[Image:Manhunt2Wii02.gif|thumb|The censorship seems like an [[LSD]] trip when you [[Own|execute]] an [[Bitch|enemy]].]]

[[Image:Manhunt-2-ps2-review-shots-1.jpg|thumb|More color shit.]]

[[Image:OldLady WiiMurder.jpg|thumb|[[Old|Old people]] love acting out murders too.]]

<center>{{frame|<youtube>XaeChZ0GM78</youtube>|color=#F04D5E}}<br><small>As you can see here, the censorship makes the executions barely visible. A victory for liberal douchebags.</small></center>
UPDATE: This video has been baleeted from Youtube. Yet another victory for them.

Even though the first ''Manhunt'' was not [[Raped|censored]], ''Manhunt 2'''s execution scenes were [[Raped|censored]]. They were [[Raped|censored]] so badly that the players could not even see what they were doing. These completely ruined the game. Parent groups were proud that they raped ''Manhunt 2'' though. There were mixed emotions on this which made the controversy of censorship in video games and the rating system even more confusing than it already was.

Thankfully, [[A Challenger Appears|a challenger appeared]] to strike back [[All Your Base Are Belong To Us|for great justice]]. A [[Russia|Russian]] team of hackers opened up the .iso file of the game, found [[Shit|the piece of shit]] code that was causing all the drama and deleted it. This enabled the game to be [[Fun|uncensored]]. More drama occurred because of this, but because this hack was epic, no one did anything about it. This hack can only be used on the [[PSP]] and [[Playstation|Gaystation 2]]. The Wii version cannot be hacked because it's too shitty to even be bothered with.

Even moar drama happened when [[an hero|an employee]] of Sony in [[British|Britain]] [http://www.gamepolitics.com/2007/10/22/manhunt-2-leak-came-from-playstation-europe-employee leaked an uncensored beta of the game.] Instead of [[STFU|keeping quiet about it]], the guy had a case of [[troll's remorse]] and was promptly [[fail|fired]].

<h3><b>How to hack it</b></h3>

Fortunately,we have an heroes that hacked the game for the sake of our [[lulz]].
This [[Hacker|hack]] is the way people said "[[Pwnt|fuck you]]" to the liberals that had the nerve to have the game [[Communism|censored]] to shit. [[Some argue|Some believe]] that this hack was planned by Rockstar, but that is a conspiracy just like [[The Man]] suppressing the black man.

The full version of this tutorial can be found [http://www.mydigitallife.info/2007/11/21/unlock-manhunt-2-to-show-uncensored-uncut-adult-only-violent-portion-hack/ here] on how to do it, but this is the short way of how to uncensor the game. Keep in mind that you will need UMDGen, Notepad ([[Duh|DUHHHHHHHHHHHHH]]), and the original .iso of the game.

----
<br>
<b>1</b>. Open ISO in UMDGEN.<br>
<b>2</b>. Extract PSP_GAME\USRDIR\GLOBAL\LVLSETUP.INI and PSP_GAME\USRDIR\LEVELS\A01_ES\GLVLSET.INI.<br>
<b>3</b>. Open the two files with any text editor, and find the following code:<br>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="background-color: #FFE4E1; border: solid 1px #330000;">
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #CD5555; border: solid 1px #330000; border-bottom: 1px solid #888;" class="codehead"> <span style="font-size: small;"><b>Code:</b></span>

</td></tr>
<tr class="codebody">
<td>
<pre>
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [GK] execution colour ramp options: flash fadein
 (sec), flash duration (sec), flash fadeout time (sec) 
EXECUTION_COLRAMP_TEXTURE FE_execramps
EXECUTION_COLRAMP_FLASH_TIMES 0.25, 0.6, 0.3
EXECUTION_COLRAMP_FADE_TIME 5.0

Change the code above to look like the following:


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [GK] execution colour ramp options: flash fadein
 (sec), flash duration (sec), flash fadeout time (sec)
EXECUTION_COLRAMP_TEXTURE
EXECUTION_COLRAMP_FLASH_TIMES 200, 0.6, 0.3
EXECUTION_COLRAMP_FADE_TIME 5.0

The changes of code will exclude and remove the color ramp texture for executions and extend the flash fade-in time to
200 seconds rather than the original 0.25 seconds to avoid full black screen fade effect. 
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<b>4</b>. If you want to remove camera shake effect during execution in the game, locate the following code in GLVLSET.INI file:

CAM_SHAKE_LAT_EXECUTION 3.0, 3.5, 0.75 CAM_SHAKE_ROLL_EXECUTION 1.0, 2.0, 0.9

Change it to:

CAM_SHAKE_LAT_EXECUTION 0, 0, 0.75 CAM_SHAKE_ROLL_EXECUTION 0, 0, 0.9

<b>5</b>. Replace original file in PSP_GAME\USRDIR\GLOBAL\LVLSETUP.INI<br>
<b>6</b>. Replace original files in all levels in PSP_GAME\USRDIR\LEVELS\ with GLVLSET.INI. There are 17 folders (levels) excluding A13_** which is missing, and the GLVSET.INI inside each level is identical. So only one change to patch GLVLSET.INI will do.<br>
<b>7</b>. Save the patched ISO.<br>
<b>8</b>. Play ''Manhunt 2'' uncensored.<br>
<b>9</b>. [[????|????]]<br>
<b>10</b>. [[profit|PROFIT!]]
<br><br>
----

You can also use [[Crap|something]] like [[1337|Gameshark]] to pwn the [[Conservative|evil]] code, but [[No one gives a shit|no one uses that crap anymore]].<br>

The end result of raping the code of the game is this: [http://www.mydigitallife.info/2007/11/21/manhunt-2-uncensoruncut-execution-style-killing-death-scene-video-compilation/ Uncensored Executions.]

{{quote|Hello everyone,<br><br>
I just bought ''Manhunt 2'' for my eight year old son. He said that he really wanted the game. So, I went and bought the [[Wii]] version of it for him. I gave the game to him and watched him play. I was astonished at how good the graphics were and how kid-friendly the game is. I was so proud of him when he acted out the murders of multiple people on the screen. My favorite was when he wrapped the telephone wire around one of the character's neck and choke him to death. After he was done with the game, I tried it out and loved it. The thrill of a kill is amazing. I am recommending to every parent here to buy ''Manhunt 2'' for their [[children]]. It is fun for the whole family!<br>
