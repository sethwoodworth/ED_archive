South Park
[[Image:Tsfsp.png|thumb|right|[[Rule 34|No exceptions]].]]
[[Image:Spsammich.jpg|thumb|right|[[Unrealistic Expectations|None]].]]

'''''South Park''''' is a [[deviantART|poorly drawn]] [[animu|cartoon series]] found to be funny by retarded [[hipsters]] that exists solely as a way to [[ED|promote its creators' political opinions]]. Created by [[Jews|Trey Parker and Matt Stone]], it debuted on [[Unfunny|Comedy Central]] in 1997, and has since gone from [[Church of Fudge|gross-out comedy]] to [[libertarian]] propaganda for the [[Republican|right,]] with occasional forays into [[Fag enabler|pro-gay propaganda]] so the two can wear dresses and blow each other in public without being branded [[Smugfag|self-loathing closet cases]].  This show has produced more [[memes]] and submemes than the last 50 years of [[Old media|public television]] combined. Along with [[Total Drama Island]], it is also one of the only two animated shows to have ever featured [[bestiality|a white person having sex with a negro]].

For a time ''South Park'' was [[4chan|funny and quotable for 12 year olds]], but then Parker and Stone decided to turn the show into a [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Individualism/Individualism soap box for their right-wing beliefs]. Occasionally, they'll reverse their rantings when it becomes fashionable, as when they bashed [[Wal-Mart]] for the same shit Starbucks does, or when they finally did an episode admitting that [[Bullshit|Climate Change]] was real [[Hypocrite|after a series of anti-Global Warming episodes]].

Typically, every episode ends with a [[moralfag|moral]], so Parker and Stone can cover up their [[Too lazy|hack writing and use of strawman arguments]] while they proudly assert that they're taking the piss out of the pretentious and self-aggrandizing and [[Unwarranted self importance|promoting freedom of speech]]...similar to [[Unwarranted self importance|Encyclopedia Dramatica]]

At the present time, there is no particular reason why anyone should continue to watch this [[shit|show]], other than being a [[basement dweller|diehard fan]] who believes watching it still makes you hip and relevant, and totally not [[True|a cocksucker.]]

==Characters==
===Main Characters===
====[[Nobody|Stan]]====
Whiny little [[faggot]] who is Trey Parker's [[Mary Sue|avatar]] on the show. Despite being the least interesting of all of the characters, he gets a large amount of [[Incest|screen time]] with his [[fucktard]]ed father. Currently dating Wendy Testaburger, a stand-in for Trey Parker's dumb slut ex-girlfriend, who dumped Trey days before ''South Park'' hit the airwaves and left him a fucking millionaire.

Though he is supposed to be best friends with Kyle, Stan has no problems whatsoever with selling Kyle out to Cartman or taking Cartman's side whenever Kyle and Cartman feud. Some [[neckbeard]]s [[Fail|believe Stan has a higher purpose and is God]], when in fact he's as interesting as watching flies on shit.

====Jew====
[[Image:Jew-kyle-kills-jesus.jpg|thumb|Right|Kyle! What did I just tell you about killing Jesus?!]]

Matt Stone's very own avatar. Like all [[Jews]] he is a [[ginger|fluffy]], whiny, curly-haired Jew bitch. This causes people to [[Cracky-chan|question his gender and age]]. The sight of him mercilessly turns [[16 year old girls]] that waste their time on [[deviantART]] into, well... [[pedophiles]]. It is enough to make [[Chris Hansen|a high authority figure]] cry.

On the other hand, he is only a Jew because his mother forces him to. Therefore, if he did not [[Retard|scream in shock]] at the sight of pictures of [[Hitler]] and complain constantly, no one would ever think he was [[Lie|Jewish]]. 

Knowing him, he has probably slept with [[who|Ariel Sharon]] or gotten raped by a [[16 year old girl]]. He also enjoys [[Family Guy|good and humorous television]].

====[[Poor|Kenny]]====
The ex-[[Star Trek|red shirt]] from an [[alcohol]]ic family. He's the most obscene of all the boys but because his parka muffles his voice, it's difficult to make out exactly what he's saying without the closed captioning on. Parker and Stone most likely thought this was a hilarious idea, allowing them to make him say whatever raunchy shit they wanted. This would be a great idea, if anybody cared two shits about Kenny himself.

When the movie came out, all the [[fantards]] went [[Insane|batshit insane]] because for the first time, it was revealed what Kenny actually looked like. Why anyone would care is beyond our understanding because all the ''South Park'' characters look exactly the fucking same.

Earlier in the series, Kenny [[Pwn|died in almost every episode]] as the show's running gag. This lasted for five seasons until Parker and Stone decided to kill Kenny off for good and replace him with Butters. Unfortunately, two things happened: Comedy Central went batshit nuts over losing merchandise money off Kenny shirts, dolls, and sticker books; and Parker and Stone made Butters into such a faggy whipping boy for the other kids that Comedy Central was forced to put the banhammer on Parker and Stone to get them to leave Butters alone. So Kenny was brought back in season six's finale and now only dies once every season, which is often the only thing Kenny does nowadays. 

In the eyes of the [[fangirl]]s, Kenny is thought of as being the [[Wut|"sexiest"]] of the boys and many a fanfic has spawned about him whoring himself out to the other boys for anonymous sex for money for the [[emo]] factor. Then again, it's obvious it was written by the people at [[deviantART]].

====[[Aspergers|Butters]]====
[[Image:Cartmansucks.gif|thumb|[[Fag|Butters]] about to give [[Fat|Cartman]] a hummer. This is really from the series.]]

A pussy who gets the [[shit]] beaten out of him by his [[mental illness|mentally ill]] mother and [[Keith Olbermann|closet-homosexual]] father, often after Cartman does something and frames Butters for it so that he can watch Butters be [[Lulz|tortured for his amusement]]. 

Butters was a background character promoted up the ladder as Kenny's replacement with the intent that instead of dying each episode, Butters would be tortured and abused and treated as the bitchboy of the group. But this got stopped when fans latched onto the character and Comedy Central, upon being told that Butter's gimmick would be "his parents beat him black and blue", forced Butters from this fate and into a secondary supporting cast member role. 

Thanks to the [[DA]] Tartlets, Butters is usually paired with Eric Cartman as a [[homosexual]] couple and drawn often like a [[tranny]], even though Cartman is the one who dresses like a girl (a fact that Butters revealed to his entire class and a group of soldiers, to Cartman's [[Lulz|horror and shame]]) and sucked Butter's cock after drugging him. Despite this, Butters' tranny persona "Marjorine" has become popular in fanart to further the faggotry.

The fact that all the characters are [[shotacon|under 10 years old]] means that the creators are not only fabulous faggots but [[pedophiles]] as well. We're not just positive on that. We're ''HIV positive''.

===Special Characters===
====[[Fat|Eric Cartman]]====
[[Image:Cartman-chris-hansen.jpg|thumb|Right|[[Chris Hansen]] questioning Cartman about the [[Rule 34]] picture he saw of him and Kyle on deviantART.]]
Cartman is the show's biggest [[douchebag|break-out character]], to such an extent that Parker and Stone have both retconned the history of the series to shove Cartman to the forefront of their vision of ''South Park'' when they initially pitched the series. However, if you watch the original batch of episodes, you'll see that Cartman was nothing more than a supporting character who quickly rose to fame and stole the show from whiny Parker/Stone voiceboxes Stan and Kyle on the basis of two [[meme]]s: "Kyle's Mom is a Big, Fat Bitch" and "BEEFCAKE!!!!!"

Eric is a [[racist]], [[sociopath|sociopathic]] closet case, and as the [[unwarranted self-importance|self-important]] spawn of a <s>hermaphrodite</s> [[ginger]], Cartman soon rose to fame as the defining character of the series. At a certain level, he's an effective representation of the Jews too. Despite being intended as an unsympathetic horrible person, he's still everyone's favorite character because he "speaks his mind" and "breaks the rules". Then fans will backpeddle and say he's just "satire" when they just want an excuse to go around making Jew jokes because it's "cool".

The evolution of Cartman can be seen in three forms: 

*Mentally retarded kid who gets manipulated by the others, culminating in him being mock-crucified and abandoned in the desert for several weeks. (Seasons 1-3)
*Manipulative schemer who seeks to make a million dollars, but who occasionally gets fucked over by people smarter than he is, and will horribly fuck up anyone who fucks with him by having their parents murdered and said parents corpses turned into chili that is they are then manipulated into eating. (Seasons 4-5)
*[[Anonymous|Satanically evil figure with no soul who will fuck you up just because.]] (Season 6-present)

[[Some argue]] Cartman jumped the shark when he entered the third phase, since Parker and Stone removed any remaining elements of being a sympathetic character from Cartman and turned him into a fat ball of pure evil incarnate.  

Most fans like to point out, at every chance possible, Cartman's immense [[Obesity|faggotry]]:

*Making out with a life-sized cardboard cut-out of Justin Timberlake while dressed up like Brittany Spears.
*Date-raping Butters with NyQuil so he could stick Butter's dick into his mouth.
*His obsession with making Kyle suck his balls, via a bet to get his tiny balls sucked off by him in the overrated ''Imaginationland'' trilogy. He also joined [[NAMBLA]] on one occasion, leading to all his friends (all [[shotacon|boys]]) being [[almost raped]]. He also fucked Leonardo Di Caprio while in drag, though he was not mentally sound at the time, having suffered a blow to the head that made him think he was a child prostitute of Vietnamese descent. 
*Giving Ben Affleck a handjob on multiple occasions.

Cartman's hatred of Jews (and love for both Hitler and Mel Gibson), as well as his weight, has caused many to speculate that Cartman's biological mother (who had sex with his tranny mother and got knocked up by him/her) is Kyle's mom, [[Irony|making Cartman half-Jewish.]] Actually, he's fucking Jewish. It's only a way to make Kyle's the good guy in all of the show, the roles have been switched purposely by Stone and Parker. Watch South Park thinking Kyle's the innocent citizen and Cartman the Jew, it all works good now.

[[shit_nobody_cares_about|NOTE: Some new details emerged with episode 200 and 201.]] Being pussies, [[Comedy Central]] had the entire episode censored and focused the episode on Cartman instead of [http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/3878 showing Muhammad]. Turns out his mom isn't a dickgirl, and wasn't actually his father. A Denver Bronco who was also the father of Scott Tenorman,\ was Cartman's father, meaning Cartman is half [[ginger]].

====[[Isaac Hayes|Chef]]====
[[Image:chefdead.jpg|thumb|right|Brb Xenu.]]

A stereotypical obese black person who would give the children advice whilst occasionally bursting into song about fucking white [[feminist|wymen]]. Eventually became a [[pedophile]] (as a metaphor for Scientology - seriously) and a Darth Vader clone. [[Scientology|I HAVE HAD IT WITH THESE MOTHERFUCKING SCAMMERS ON MY MOTHERFUCKIN' LIFE!]] Since he has slept with [[over 9,000]] women, it is no doubt he has herpes. Or Scientology pamphlets.

Like every religious person ([[Christfag]]s, [[Jews]], [[Terrorist|Muslims]], [[Assholes|atheists]] etc.), Hayes was happy to take the piss out of other peoples' beliefs but left ''South Park'' forever when they started making fun of his own <del>religion</del> [[Scientology|cult]]. So Parker and Stone turned Hayes' Chef into a brainwashed, globetrotting [[pedo]]phile who was no longer interested in "[[list of sex moves|making sweet love to you, woman]]", but instead interested in putting his balls in Kyle's rectum after he'd joined a "fruity little club" called the '''Super Adventure Club'''.

It is also believed that Hayes was murdered by members of the cult, due to the fact that he did not stick his ass 4 feet in the air for them when questioned about his opinion on the episode that he "quit" because of. This is purely speculation and should not be taken as fact. Just saying.....

==[[Shit nobody cares about|Notable Moments in South Park History]]==

===South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)===

[[Image:Scientology Cmonjews.jpg|thumb|Damn, skippy.]]
''South Park: The Movie'' is an [[Circular logic|offensive film with the message that no one should be offended by an offensive film.]]

When ''South Park'' first debuted, everyone and their mother believed that the show would self-destruct in a trail of "flavor of the week" failure once the show's shock appeal wore off. So Parker and Stone convinced Paramount to greenlight a movie version of the series, in the guise of a musical about freedom of speech and censorship, as production of the movie came just as the Columbine High School shooting took place and everyone was demanding censorship of everything remotely controversial. 

After several weeks of hard work, the film debuted in the summer of 1999 and was a surprise hit, in spite of the constant musical numbers and a subplot about Saddam Hussein fucking Satan in a mad grab for power in the afterlife. Many attribute the success to the fact that Parker and Stone were allowed to say "fuck", a fact that was a major plot point of the film's story.

{{quote|Fuck, fuckity, fuck fuck fuck.| Cartman getting [[butthurt|hurt]] over how he can't say "fuck" in school.}}

The movie was notably prescient in portending, among other things, the death of Saddam Hussein, [http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/12/military-trial-for-canadian-born-terrorism-suspect-omar-khadr-is-underway/ the subjection of Canadian terrorists to U.S. military tribunals], and the ferocious appeal that [[Trailer Park Boys|a Canadian television program about a pair of foul-mouthed yet lovable heathens]] would have on fringe audiences in the U.S.

===Shit Episode (2001)===
''South Park'' had [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Hits_the_Fan an episode] centered on the notion of repeating the word "[[shit]]" uncensored on TV. A counter in the corner stated that it was repeated 162 times in the 22 minute air time. This might have been quite an impressive feat, had the episode not been nearly indistinguishable from every other episode of ''South Park'' ever made.

===[[Scientology]] Episode (2005)===
[http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/912 The infamous episode] in which Scifags convince Stan that he is the reincarnation of [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and has been chosen to lead the [[Cult|church]]. After telling [[Tom Cruise]] that he [[DO NOT WANT|doesn't think much of his acting]], Tom locks himself [[Not gay|in Stan's closet]] and refuses to leave despite the best efforts of [[John Travolta]], [[Scifag|Nichole Kidman]] and [[golden shower|R. Kelly]], resulting in a ridiculously drawn out and overused joke about Tom Cruise's obvious closet [[faggotry]].

In reaction to the episode, Cruise immediately went into panty bunched [[nerd rage]] mode and threatened to stop promoting his fail movie ''[[Ex-Gay|Mission Impossible 3]]'' if [[Viacom]] aired the episode again (since Viacom and the movie studio have the same owner). After initially obliging, Viacom let YouTube have at it...which is pretty impressive since Viacom have been suing YouTube over ''[[Daily Show]]'' and ''[[Colbert Report]]'' clips for at least 100 years.

===[[Internet]] Episodes (2008)===

[[Image:Spchoklitrein.JPG|left|thumb|[[Internets phenomena]]? In ''my'' ''South Park''?]]

Season 12 includes a couple of poorly-written episodes that give nods to what the creators must perceive as the "Internet culture". More specifically [http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/1206/?episode=1206 "Over-Logging"] and the more widely received [http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/1204 "Canada on Strike"], which features a bunch of [[old meme|old]] and [[rape|forced]] [[forced memes|memes]] killing one another. [http://www.google.com/search?q=4chan+city Real original.]

===200th Episode Controversy (2010)===

[[Image:Southparkmuhammad.jpg|thumb|right|What, me Jihad?]]

To commemorate their 200th episode, it was decided by Parker and Stone that the show would revisit past controversies by concocting a plot in which the town of South Park is sued by [[butthurt|upset]] celebrities and other famous figures that the program has ruthlessly [[troll|satirized]] over the years. In effect, they were manufacturing a fictional confrontation with their political enemies at a level none has ever pursued [[IRL]], the show’s antics having long since [[nobody cares|lost their edginess and novelty]] with the [[libtard|Hollywood and political elite]] years ago.

So far, so predictable. A wild card entered the mixture, however, when the [[fags|creative duo]] decided to up the ante with the [[Islam|Muslim community]] they had previously desisted from provoking in a previous two-parter, “Cartoon Wars”, where a benign representation of the religion’s leader, Muhammad, was censored by Comedy Central. This time around, the plot had previous South Park [[lolcow|target]] [[Placentafag|Tom Cruise]] agreeing to drop the town’s lawsuit in exchange for meeting the head Muslim for the clandestine purpose of acquiring his semen, which he and other celebrities believed would protect them from ridicule. Real-life [[homosexual|semen collectors]] Parker and Stone then added a number of other [[unfunny|hilarious plot twists]], and ended the episode on a cliffhanger.

[[Image:Brb72virgins!.jpg|thumb|left|A rare example of a [[13-year-old boy]] that's not a Cartman fan]]
[[lulz|Unfortunately]], it seems the pair had finally thrown down with a group [[insane|apeshit]] enough to take them up on their behavior, and faster than you could say, “Holy Homo Has-been [[h8r]], [[Batman]]!” a website appeared with a picture of Theo Van Gogh (victim of the IRL equivalent of [[hacking]]) and the warning that the two were on some [[The Internet is serious business|serious]] thin ice as far as the [[bullshit|Religion Of Peace]] was concerned. In their rush to foment controversy, it seemed, they had neglected to factor in the possibility that a religious group [[Batshit#Batshit_Crazy|batshit nutzo]] enough to actually [[wtc|pick a fight]] with the [[America|world’s most powerful military]] and fight it with weaponized [[an hero]]’s might be a tad more formidable an opponent than [[slut|Jennifer Lopez]] and the [[Scientologist]]s.

What might have been an [[epic]] battle that would have rivaled in entertainment a brawl between your [[bitch|ex-wife]] and [[asshole|your boss]] on a barroom floor was forestalled, however, when Parker/Stone decided they liked their bodies <s>[[coward|knife-free]] and worked with Comedy Central to re-edit the second part of the episode. The focus of the show was shifted yet again to [[old meme|the subject of Cartman’s father]], Muhammad was [[what|changed into Santa Claus]] and the dynamic duo of Matt and Trey retired to the [[mantrain|Buttcave]] to both savor their [[drama queen|new-found media relevance]] and the lack of stab wounds on each other’s bodies.</s>
disregard that [[faggots|Comedy Central]] was solely responsible for the edit.

<s>In short, they pussied out. Fuck you Matt, and fuck you Trey, you [[Vagoo|nutless]] fucks.</s>
disregard this as well, Matt and Trey have gotten into further shit with [[Liberals|Comedy Central]] for apologizing to fans as a direct response to the network's [[White_guilt|White guilt]] over the [[Everybody_Draw_Mohammed_Day|Cultural Insensitivity]]. Despite this, south park will still be around till [[Next_Thursday|Next Thursday]] though we know soon they'll die again only come back as sick as they were before. Those creeps.

==South Park and Its Fanbase==

[[Image:Republican.jpg|thumb|A typical ''South Park'' fan.]]

[[Image:Gop.jpg|thumb|right|lol hey did you see last night's episode about hippies?]]

{{quote|i think south park is a [[pretty cool guy]]. eh makes fun of Jews and doesn't afraid of anything.|[[Typical]] South Park fan. I swears it!}}

The fanbase of the show, which becomes moar [[fail]] and cancerous with each season, generally consists of:

*[[Weeaboo]] who [[Bishie syndrome|constantly draw the characters in animu style]] so they won't feel bad about fantasizing over 8-year old cock (or 9, who gives a fuck when the creators can't even make up their mind) when it's drawn "sexily". 

*[[16-year old girl]]s who fantasize of screwing the main boys and that BAWWW if anyone mocks their [[faggotry|true love]]. These can be found easily on deviantART along with the weeaboos. 

*A rabid [[slash]] fandom that consists of both above categories, as well as the occasional [[furfag]] and [[Hot Topic]] posers. Many of their [[shit|masterpieces]] can be found on [[FanFiction.Net]], its bastard spawn FOS-FF, and DA. Usually involves Kyle sucking Stans dick.

*[[Basement dweller]]s that spend all their time on the "South Park Studios" message board, ready to kill each other over opinions on a fucking cartoon show. These types tend to proclaim themselves as being "mature" and think they know the show better than the own creators, but in fact tend to be [[13-year old boy]]s or middle-aged men who throw a tantrum if someone calls them out on their bullshit, and start flamewars over being proven wrong.

*The fans that act like every episode is free of flaws and start [[internet drama]] over someone not agreeing with their blatant ass-kissing, though you also get plenty of the [[Emo]]s who [[troll]] and whine about the show not being like the "classic" seasons, yet continue to watch just for the purpose of bitching. All of these and more tend to dwell mostly on [http://www.southparkstudios.com/ South Park Studios]. Others use [[AllAbout-SP]] for their faggotry.

*In rarer instances, you get [[butthurt]] het diehards (usually Stan/Wendy) that cry moar over how the slashers keep ruining "their" show. Welcome to the ''South Park'' fandom, fags. 

*You also get retarded 14-16-year-old upper middle class children who think that everything ever said by the show is funny, and watch it while their mom goes out to get them hot-pockets and weed. Example- [http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=660290/ ned15]

*Stoners that think that saying one liners while doing an impression of Cartman is the most funny original thing ever said. Example- [http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=700501/ RideTheLightning] 

*Politically confused college students ([[aspies]]) that are either a Democrat or a Republican, yet vote the other way, showing complete lack of political knowledge.  They are fans of South Park because they think if gives them a higher understanding of philosophical and political ideologues, when in reality it just makes them a faggot. Example- [http://www.youtube.com/user/michaeloptv michaeloptv] 

* 15 or 16 year old fags who have no life outside the internet and masturbate to their internet "friends" 

* [[catholic|Nuns]], [[moralfags]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[liberal|Guardian readers]] and [[feminazis]] secretly love [[anal|South Park]] because they can watch [[Avatar|little cartoon characters]] saying all the naughty things (using [[cunt|naughty words]]) that they themselves cannot say (or even think). It's like [[anger|Primal Scream Therapy]] for the [[fucktard|politically and religiously correct]], and oft you can hear a suppressed [[tit]]ter from behind a [[bondage|wimple]]. Or [[Shit Nobody Cares About|something]].

*Fat WoW Gamers who are usually fans of [[Family Guy]] who constantly repeat the same lines over and over again from last nights episode and constantly talk about how the [[World of Warcraft]] episode of South Park was the best episode [[EVAR]]

*Fans tend to believe that the humor of South Park is of the highest sophistication. If one would express dissatisfactory with the humor that is presented in this show, the person is likely to be met with the highest disbelief. The fanboy is likely to say that one just does not understand its humor, rather than admitting the simplicity of it.

Examples of these fans include:

*'''Mewster'''
A psychotic, middle-aged schoolteacher whose hate for Cartman was such [[serious business]], he created a (now baleeted) site with shotacon-worthy fanart to showcase just HOW much he hated the character. He was also known to flame and troll anyone he considered to be a Cartman fan, claiming that Cartman fans [[Lie|drove him to insanity]]. He was worshiped as a BNF among Cartman haters, until [[shit nobody cares about|his wife got pissed and told him to leave the BBS. He later reregistered as '''Cartman's Top Enemy''' and continued to troll]]. Most of the fans who used to think he was the [[lulz]] came to see what a retard he was and cut ties with him for their own sanity.

== How do they do it? ==

Creating an episode of south park is an easy task, first come up with a list of subjects that people may find touchy. So let's take Christianity, Gay marriage, whale hunting, and the economy. Now all we ave to do is tie these all together. It would go like this: Jesus comes down from heaven (which turns out to be a brothel) and wants to marry Mr.Garrison but still keep his day job being a gay prostitute. Jesus has a plan to stimulate the economy by sending all blacks to prison to assemble atomic bombs to sell to terrorists which in turn nuke whales. At this point someone in the background would say "all the blacks are already in prison" and later in the episode everyone in town would be wearing T-shirts like "Send the blacks to prison for Gay Jesus" and at some point god would turn out to be Richard Dawkins.
Then parker and stone would do an interview claiming they have NO idea why people hate their show so much. And that their creative expression is protected under the first amendment.

If the accurate description above is a little too [[tl;dr]], here's a step-by-step breakdown:

# Stone and Parker steal [[old meme]] off of the [[internets]]
# South Park kids participate in meme
