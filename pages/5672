'''Neal Horsley''' is a ultra right-wing pedophile who runs around holding up pictures of aborted fetuses while screaming in people's faces to [[abortion|cut that shit out]]. He even has gone so far as to put up a site which [[IDIFTL|catalogs abortionists who have been killed]], along with putting up [[stalker|webcams]] and streaming them to his site. Everyone hates him, including his fellow [[Christians|pro-lifers]], and he is constantly being harassed for his extreme views. He also likes to fuck [[bestiality|animals]] (along with anything else that is [[sick fuck|warm and moist]]). This draws the obvious conclusion that he wants to save all the babies so he can make [[baby fuck|sweet sweet love]] [[Awwright|to them all]].

__TOC__

==Views==
Neal doesn't like abortion very much. As a matter of fact, he '''[[Serious business|FUCKING HATES ABORTION]]'''! His line of "[[Circular logic|reasoning]]" seems to go something like this: Abortion should be illegal because abortion involves killing God's children. It's Satan's fault that abortion is legal because Satan gets all the aborted fetuses. If Neal can't convince everybody of this holy truth, then God will get seriously pissed and [[pwn]] the U.S.A. Since Neal knows all this, he knows he must do [[murder|everything]] necessary to get the rest of us to understand. That's his completely logical reasoning for spying on women at abortion clinics, aiding and abetting murder by listing abortion workers' [[dox]] online, and in general acting like a good [[asshole|Christian]]. Now of course the [[Government]] and [[media]] are to blame for all the babies being [[guro|torn asunder]].  Therefore, Neal does not trust either. That's why when the supreme court [http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm?aid=681 levies a decision against him], it's really because it's part of a [[conspiracy]]. Along this same line, when his views are questioned on a news show, it's part of the broader conspiracy.

== In The Media ==
Of course Neal's views have gotten him in trouble with pretty much everyone. From the media, to the courts, to [[liberals]], and even with other pro-lifers - they all [[hate]] him. In response, Neal has appeared at various times on different [[old media|news shows]] to try and defend himself. He puts up a good fight with [[ad hominem|amazing arguments]] and [[bullshit|witty retorts]], but unfortunately he seems to get pwned again and again. If only they weren't [[insane|all conspiring against him]].

== Can I Haz Governor Plz ==
Seeing the direction the liberal media and corrupt government lean on abortion, Neal figured the best way to combat it would be to [[unrealistic expectations|get himself elected]] into public office. He founded his own party called the Creator's Rights Party which stands for tradition family values (such as outlawing abortion, putting God back into government, getting rid of ridiculous ideas such as [[evolution]], and permabanning the gays). He has run for Governor of Georgia several times now without success. How he hasn't been elected yet is anyone's guess.

== Music Career ==
Neal doesn't just [[annoying|scream]] in people's faces to get his point across. He understands that it sometimes requires a softer approach to con people into his [[religion|arcane beliefs]]. With that in mind, Neal will sometimes pull out his 6 stringed mistress (along with accompanying mouth mask) and strum a beautiful hymn on the [[guro|tearing from limb to limb]] of [[babies]].  How touching.

== Mule Whisperer ==
Neal grew up on a farm in [[Georgia]]. This means that his first girlfriend was a [[animal|mule]]. This isn't just true of Neal, but of anyone who has ever grown up on a [[white trash|farm]]. Now you might be thinking "[[fact|eww gross]]" but that's just your liberal pussy talking. As a matter of fact, when all boys are growing up, they will stick their dicks into '''ANYTHING''' that is [[lol wut|warm, moist, and vibrates]]. Don't believe me? Well don't take my word for it; just listen to what an [[expert]] on the subject had to say on ''The Alan Colmes Show'':

== Artwork ==
Neal's talent apparently knows no bounds. On top of the preaching, spying, promoting murder, animal fucking, and serenading, he also likes to make some amazing [[shoops]]. Check this sweet gallery of [[win]].
