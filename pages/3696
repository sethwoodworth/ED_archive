Herostratus
{{Quote|1=I AM THE REAL HEROSTRATUS, BACK FROM THE DEAD!|2=Herostratus taking sysop powers seriously|3=[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&page=Temple+of+Artemis]}}

'''Herostratus''' was the victim of a sick joke. A awful [[rumor]] about him was speaking throughout the [[Internet]]. People were claiming that Herostratus, who has been renown for removing pro-pedophilia [[bias]] from [[Wikipedia]], was a [[pedophile]] himself. This rumor nearly ruined Herostratus' Wikipedia career. [[Ironically]], Herostratus was the one who created the rumor. He created it as a joke, but everyone [[accidentally]] took it seriously. Of course, this is the result of Herostratus' chronic [[unfunny]]ness.

==Background==
In ancient [[Greek]] mythology, Herostratus was a person who sought [[USI|fame]] through [[vandalism]]. He [[9/11|set a holy temple on fire]] and proudly took credit for it. Since Herostratus sought [[BJAODN|infamy though vandalism]], the Greeks decided to punish him by striking his name from history. Unfortunately, [[Willy on Wheels|erasing him from history didn't work]].

Although this would be an awesome name for a Wikipedia vandal, there wasn't any pre-2005 vandal smart enough to chose a name with historical roots. The person would would eventually carry the "Herostratus" username was a [[Fag|goody-two-shoes editor]] from [[Boston]].

==Pedophilia Article Watch==

:''See [[wikipedia:User:Herostratus/Pedophilia_and_Me]] for Herostratus' version of events.''

Young Herostratus became a wikipedo in 2005 and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&dir=prev&contribs=user&target=Herostratus&namespace=4 quicky became involved in AfD discussions]. On December 31, 2005, Herostratus happened to stumble upon [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Childlove movement|Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Childlove movement]]. He couldn't [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Childlove_movement&diff=33422683&oldid=33422472 expressed his distaste for the article in a secular fashion].

On January 6, 2006, Herostratus [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotusduck&diff=34082265&oldid=34065358 conceived an idea about organizing a group to combat pro-pedophilia bias]:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">Hey Lotusduck. Hey I was just down at the <s>Childlove</s> Pedophilia advocacy AfD... sheesh... that one's gonna be kept. Anyway, somehow that led me here. I have serious problems with that article. Compare to say [[wikipedia:Holocaust denial|Holocaust denial]] -- man [[wikipedia:Pedophilia advocacy|Pedophilia advocacy]] is a ''lot'' more subject-friendly. I think it needs some work, but by an organized group... do you agree?</blockquote>

He even [[Godwin's Law|compared pedophiles to Holocaust deniers]]. On January 21, 2006, Herostratus [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Pedophilia_Article_Watch&diff=prev&oldid=36025797 created Wikipedia:WikiProject Pedophilia Article Watch], but the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Pedophilia&diff=prev&oldid=38710252 project was nominated for deletion due to "poor taste"] on February 8, 2006. The project was kept due to a lack of [[consensus]].

Also of interest is [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:WikiProject Pedophilia Article Watch/Ham & Eggs|Wikipedia:WikiProject Pedophilia Article Watch/Ham & Eggs]], which was supposedly a list of pro-pedophilia editors ("Eggs") and banned anti-pedophilia editors ("Ham"). Unfortunately, [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:WikiProject Pedophilia Article Watch/Ham & Eggs|it was deleted]] because Wikipedia wasn't going to keep shrines to disruptive users any longer.

Oddly enough, [[Tyciol]] was also [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Pedophilia_Article_Watch&diff=150146244&oldid=150072297 a member of WikiProject Pedophilia Article Watch].

==Herostratus the sysop==
[[File:LoliWikipetan.JPG|thumb|[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&page=File%3ALoliwikipetan.jpg Herostratus deleted this Wikipe-tan lolicon in 2007].]]

{{Quote|1='''Oppose''' Likley to abuse tools per experience on [[wikipedia:Lolicon|Lolicon]].|2=[[Hipocrite]] on sysop abuse|3=[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Herostratus&diff=58579074&oldid=58578804]}}

On June 13, 2006, TantalumTelluride [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FHerostratus&action=historysubmit&diff=58453348&oldid=58451536 nominated Herostratus for adminship]. As with President [[Obama]]'s nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize, Herostratus received unwarranted support despite his inexperience and somewhat childish attitude. Herostratus' childish demeanor is made clear by [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Herostratus/Interview|his silly mock interview]]. Users such as Andypanty.UK (as in the [[wikipedia:Andy Pandy|ancient televised children's show]] believed that Herostratus didn't deal with vandals in the appropriate matter, while users such as [[Hipocrite]] believed that Herostratus lacked conflict revolution skills and misunderstood the image policy. Most users voted in favor of Herostratus due to his edit count and his activity against pedophilia. Some even [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Herostratus&diff=58664440&oldid=58661017 voted for Herostratus' due to sense of humor]:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">'''Strong Support''', especially after the Lolicon thing. Also, we need more admins that have a sense of humor, and that are committed to actually writing the encyclopedia.</blockquote>

[[Foreshadowing|As seen later]], Herostratus' "sense of humor" is one of his greatest flaws. It should also be noted that Herostratus acted like an [[Internet tough guy]] for [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Herostratus&diff=59017628&oldid=58677999 supposedly stopping the "Squidward" vandal].

==Rumored pedophilia==
:''See [[Wikipedia:User:Herostratus/Holy Jumping Catfish!]] for Herostratus' version of events.''

===Creation of the rumor===
The rumor was created on June 1, 2008. On that day, Herostratus added the following text to his userpage:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">Ever since The Incident &mdash; you probably read about it in the papers &mdash; they have greatly restricted my computer access, therefore I have not been and will not be as active as I would like. For a while. After a certain period of good behavior the Local Council may restore my computer privileges. Thank you for your patience.</blockquote>

On August 4, 2008, the [[Wikipedia Review]] discovered the change to Herostratus' userpage, and [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=19664 it sparked their curiosity]:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">
<p>What is The Incident referred to on his user page? Given his, er, subjects of interest <code>:o</code>  I can only guess...  <code>O_o</code></p>

<p>... but does anyone {{Sic|esle|else}} know?</p>
</blockquote>

[http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=19664&pid=119109&#entry119109 They obviously took the joke seriously].

===Wikipedia Review===
On February 11, 2010, Herostratus elaborated on the situation:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">UPDATE: Rather than improving, my situation has deteriorated. Now I am no longer allowed access to the internet, amd am forbidden to watch television or listen to the radio. Nor am I allowed to view any periodicals published before 1960. The only way I can make edits is to mark up a printout and pass it to my majordomo to be typed into Wikipedia. Frustrating!</blockquote>

And then the [[Shitstorm|shit hit the fan]]. On February 23, 2010, EricBarbour [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=28682&#entry223139 claimed that Herostratus was a pedophile]:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">Herostratus, notorious pedophile POV-pusher, is apparently in prison right now for possessing child pornography. Has anyone tried to revoke his adminship?</blockquote>

On February 24, 2010, EricBarbour started a [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=28685 Wikipedia Review thread about Herostratus]:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">
<p>Despite being banned from Wikipedia (and computers generally) by court order, notorious pedophilia editor Herostratus is still able to edit WP.</p>

<p>How? By getting his court-appointed minder to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Herostratus&diff=343196318&oldid=302022861 edit for him], apparently.</p>

<p>Check his edit log for proof. He's doing it, even while being banned from watching TV or listening to the radio. Mentioned [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=28682 here].</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">Why is his account still active?</p>
</blockquote>
 
EricBarbour believed every word on Herostratus' userpage, and the thread grabbed the attention of Wikipedia sysop Viridae. After reading the thread, Viridae [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&page=User%3AHerostratus blocked Herostratus] for ''account owner not in control of account''. Herostratus [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&page=User%3AHerostratus unblocked himself] a few hours later. Judging from [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Viridae&diff=346018166&oldid=345560943 his message to Viridae], Herostratus didn't have any idea about what was going on.

Instead of replying to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Viridae&diff=346018166&oldid=345560943 Herostratus' message] and ending the situation without drama, Viridae [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=346020827 started an "Incidents" thread] in order to gain the attention of the Wikipedian [[MFWIC|big dogs]]. Viridae also claimed that he or she didn't know that Herostratus was an sysop. Judging from the [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive599#Herostratus|first few replies]], most users believed Viridae. Viridae also [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=346023696 Emailed ArbCom]. Herostratus had to straighten things out himself with an [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=346024437 emotional outburst]:

<blockquote style="color:darkgreen;">For goodness sake, can't you people recognize a joke when you see one? Under what conditions on this planet is a person "not allowed to view periodicals published {{Hover|after|He actually written &quot;before&quot; on his userpage}} 1960", for crying out loud. Good grief. How about a note to the talk page before a block, hmm?</blockquote>

Once again, the Wikipedia Review's [[obsession]] with Wikipedia's flaws turned into a careless witch-hunt complete with [[lulz]]. This isn't a surprise since [[common sense]] and a sense of humor are in sort supply on the Internet. According to the Wikipedia Review, [[The Internet is serious business|editing Wikipedia is serious business]].

===[[ArbCom]]===
Of course, the [[drama]] didn't end there due to that Email Viridae sent earlier. on March 3, 2010, Hersfold [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Motions&diff=347435987&oldid=331970001 opened an Arbitration case] against Herostratus and Viridae. The case [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Motions&diff=347915108&oldid=347914724 lasted until March 5, 2010]. According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Motions&oldid=347914724#Herostratus_.2F_Viridae the decision], sysops like Herostratus shouldn't joke around with their userpages and that Viridae was too trigger-happy in weeding out suspected pedophiles. An silly [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Motions&oldid=347914724#Discussion argument also erupted] on whether Viridae should be "admonished" for stupidity. The ArbCom was basically a waste of time since the issue was already resolved and understood in the February ANI thread.

==Recall==
Sometime in June 2010, the Kenneth Dickson article was nominated for deletion for the second time. The original discussion [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&page=Wikipedia%3AArticles+for+deletion%2FKenneth+Dickson+%282nd+nomination%29 was deleted] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=move&page=Wikipedia%3AArticles+for+deletion%2FKenneth+Dickson+%283rd+nomination%29 then overwritten] due to BLP violations, so what exactly happened can't be known. What is known for sure is that Herostratus said pretty nasty things about [[Republican|Dickson]]. These attacks on a political hopeful disturbed Cirt, who [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=368228853 reported the issue] on BLP Noticeboard. Apparently, [[freedom of speech]] isn't appreciated on Wikipedia. Since sysops are supposed to be nice to living persons in any namespace and [[DeviantArt|criticism isn't acceptable]], Off2riorob [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Herostratus&diff=368235850&oldid=368231188 asked for Herostratus' resignation], and the recall process was initialized.

On June 23, 2010, after [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Herostratus&oldid=373476674#Admin_recall days of debate], the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Herostratus_2&diff=prev&oldid=369745803 recall voting process started]. Most users found the entire situation silly and voted in support of Herostratus. The recall RfA also [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Bureaucrats'_noticeboard/Archive_19#Herostratus.27_.22recall.22_RfA|created much controversy]], especially since there isn't an official recall procedure. Due to the lack of a standard procedure, Herostartus was free to establish his own rules and guidelines for the recall. Herostratus originally barred sysops from voting, since he believed that they would vote in his favor in order to prevent future recalls. This [[wikipedia:Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Herostratus_2#Who_can_and_who_can.27t_comment|caused further drama]], especially since assuming that sysops would vote for him in order to save their position is ''Assuming Bad Faith''. Due to the complaints, Herostratus [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Herostratus_2&diff=369905499&oldid=369905355 allowed sysops to vote].

Drama also erupted over when and how the recall RfA would end. On June 24, 2010, Nihonjoe [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FHerostratus_2&action=historysubmit&diff=369853462&oldid=369852962 prematurely closed the recall], since he or she considered it an "improper forum". Ncmvocalist then [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Herostratus_2&diff=369871670&oldid=369871305 reverted the closure] and [[wikipedia:User_talk:Nihonjoe/Archive_51#Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship.2FHerostratus_2|started an argument]]. The recall RfA [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Herostratus_2&diff=371050030&oldid=371048595 was finally closed] on June 30, 2010. Although 78 users users supported him and 48 users opposed him (excluding 21 neutral votes), it was decided that Herostratus should still be desysoped.

On June 30, 2010, Herostratus [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steward_requests/Permissions&diff=2025360&oldid=2025227 requested to be desysoped], and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&page=User%3AHerostratus%40enwiki that request was accept]. Herostratus' last action as a sysop ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHerostratus&action=historysubmit&diff=371047346&oldid=371047104 at the suggestion of a friend]) was to live up to the name of the original Herostratus by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&page=Temple+of+Artemis deleting the Temple of Artemis article].

==Wikipedia Review critic==
After the false accusations of being a pedophile, Herostratus naturally developed a distaste for the Wikipedia Review. Nevertheless, Herostratus' criticisms of the Wikipedia Review's selective use of free speech (though ED's is superior) is absurd. He basically believes that the Wikipedia Review shouldn't criticize or mock Wikipedia users. Needless to say, Herostratus wouldn't last long on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] with that sort of attitude.

On August 14, 2010, Herostratus [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alison&diff=378904967&oldid=378838884 communicated his concerns] to [[Alison]]. Herostratus claimed that Alison was being mean and that she should follow WP:CIVIL outside of Wikipedia. After failing to convince Alison, Herostratus decided to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29&diff=prev&oldid=379346717 seek a second opinion] from the Village pump on August 17, 2010 (full thread found [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_78#Regarding_off-Wiki_posts:_do_they_exist.3F|here]]). By August 22, 1010, Herostratus wasn't satisfied by any of the responses he received, so he decided to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJimbo_Wales&action=historysubmit&diff=380241135&oldid=380226713 ask King Jimbo for his opinion] (full thread found [[Wikipedia:User_talk:Jimbo_Wales/Archive_63#Regarding_Wikipedia_editors_participating_in_Wikipedia_Review|here]]) under the false idea that Jimbo was the [[Final Boss|final arbitrator of Wikipedia law]].

==Creampie disruptions==
[[File:220px-Cumfart 02.png|thumb|Uploaded onto TOW by Herostratus ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=upload&page=File%3A220px-Cumfart_02.png not making this up]).]]

On September 20, 2010, Herostatus [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=upload&page=File%3ACumfart_02.jpg uploaded File:Cumfart_02.jpg] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creampie_%28sexual_act%29&diff=385846150&oldid=382262965 claimed that it was an improvement] over the previous cartoon porn that the [[wikipedia:Creampie (sexual act)|Creampie article]] used. Herostratus believed that the image shouldn't use a plain background, so he added [[Emoticon|happy faces]] to it. This didn't sit well with the Wikipedia establishment, and a silly argument resulted. It ended up on [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive639#User:Herostratus|WP:AN/I]], and [[Georgewilliamherbert]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Herostratus&diff=386110375&oldid=385997878 accused Herostratus of disruption].

Of course, the argument didn't end there. Herostratus uploaded [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=upload&page=File%3A220px-Cumfart_02.png File:Cumfart_02.png] on September 27, 2010. On November 6, 2010, Herostratus filled a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests_for_mediation/Creampie_(sexual_act)|request for mediation]], and the strange debate continues to this day.
