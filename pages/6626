'''''Progress Quest''''' is a [[leet|state-of-the-art]] [[computer]] [[roleplay]]ing [[game]] famed for its innovative and sophisticated mechanics.

==The Plot==
''Progress Quest'' has a complex, intertwining plot, with many possible endings depending on the character's actions. The basic structure is free-form, with virtually unlimited freedom of choice in a truly vast game world. From the official website:

"''Since time before time the Vorlak had held the Crosshutch at Thraeskamp. The ancient reckoning held that the Five Skrelkampi (and their Truebine) would return when the great Trond-feast could be held anew and the Belnap reunited. But this legend became lost to all but the Papperboxen at Horbug. One of their own was Yallow the Speldrig, who found an unlikely pupil in Torbole Understeady, the discarded illigitimate waif of Wainthane Topknox, whom Yallow renamed Grumdrig and began to school as a boar-pulmet's apprentice....And, as it was said by some, in aberdoxy.''"

That just about sums it up.

==The Setting==
The first thing a new player will notice, aside from the [[lie|superb 3D graphics]] and mind-blowing surround sound, is the sheer size of ''Progress Quest''. There are [[Nerd|people]] who have played for literally years solidly, without reaching the end of the game. The immense scale may seem overwhelming at first, but thankfully ''Progress Quest'''s quest automation system makes keeping on top of the many interesting and diverse quests, sub-quests, mini-quests and bonus quests a breeze. The game features a large selection of unusual races and classes, adding to the already enormous replay value.

==Playing the Game==
''Progress Quest'' can be played single player, but the real fun comes from joining one of the many dedicated multiplayer servers and mixing it up online. The games controls are simple and intuitive, and fit easily on a small reference sheet for handy in-game consultation. Combat in ''Progress Quest'' is just as simple and intuitive. There is no need to fine-tune your character for every battle you face, the games elegant (as a fucking crank whore) character optimization system takes care of all the annoying micro-management so common is lesser RPG's, leaving you to focus on the fun.

==Online Community==
''Progress Quest'' has a vibrant online community of wretches, whores, cheap tricks, fat sacks of shit, and one lone Chinese man playing from his child whore house somewhere on the outskirts of Beijing.
