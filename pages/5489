[http://morganphantom15.deviantart.com/ Morganphantom15] is one of the new additions to the Horton Hears a Who fandom. She is known for having called off her [[lolwut|fictional wedding]] between [[Mary_Sue|her]] and [[faggot|Stan]] from South Park in  order to pursue a relationship with [[emo|Jojo]] from the Horton Hears a Who movie. Seeing as Jojo and Stan are in fact, [[shota|little boys]], one may wonder if Morgan is a [[pedophile]]. [[truth|Fact]]: Morgan threatened to become [[an hero]] IRL over the final episode of South Park's 11th season because Wendy [[delusional|stole her man]]. This was laughed upon by most, but of course she [[Delete_fucking_everything|deleted everything]] before caps were made. This was [[at least 100]] days before [[Jojo]].

== The Wedding is OFF! ==
Morgan was just like any other [[tartlet]], she made shiny animu art between her and Stan, and made up a [[desu|cute]] little [[fanfiction|storyline]] where [[bitch|Stan]] and her Mary-Sue [[buttsex|make love]] and have two kids. This garnered many [[fans|friends]] who supported her [[batshit_insane|love]] for Stan. However one day while she was [[masturbation|flicking her bean]] to South Park, she saw the commercials for the new Horton Hears a Who movie and her love for Stan was all but forgotten!

{{quote| Yes, it's kinda hard for me in a way, I've loved Stan for almost 2 years and now it's over, I wish it wasn't, but I just don't love him anymore, so there will be no wedding, well not yet, if good things go one with me and Jojo, there might be another XD!!!!|Morganphantom15}}

But what of her children with Stan you say? Well she thought of that! With a snap of her chubby pedophile fingers, she changed the father to Jojo as if nothing ever happened!

{{quote| Also, if you are wondering about Mark and Renee. They are still my children, but now I'm gonna go as if Stan wasn't their father, instead Jojo was, there are only two things different about them now, Mark doesn't feel sick around Vi, and Renee has brown eyes like jojo. |Morganphantom15}}

== True Love 4eva! ==
[[Image:Obsessed001.jpg|thumb|120px|I love him more than anything!!1!1]]
Her new love had to be [[attention_whore|proclaimed]] for all of DeviantArt to see! I mean, couldn't they see that she [[lie|truly loved]] Jojo and it wasn't just because he looks like an [[emo|emo child]] and has the voice of Jesse McCartney? No, Morgan's love was totally [[fangirl|real]]! So like any [[16 year old girl|15 year old]] would do, she made a new journal to do so!

== Baawww! ==
Alas, from all good drama there is lulz to be had, as undoubtedly Morganphantom15 was snarked which resulted in much [[lulz]] and [[drama]] for all! People began to tell her that it was [[truth|unhealthy]] for her to lust after [[pedophile|fictional little boy cock]], so her [[tartlet|friends]] came to the rescue, telling people to [[STFU]] because she could love whoever she wanted! Nevermind that he wasn't real nor [[shota|of legal age]]! So Morgan did what [[idiot|anyone]] would do, she begged people to stop being [[troll|mean]] to her!

{{quote| But, I just wish everyeone would stop, dissing me doesn't make them better people, it makes them jerks. It may be creepy to you, but it's not to me, and the best thing to do when you see someone like me whn it comes to a cartoon is to ignore me, not making me feel bad. Cause it dosn't make me want to stop loving Jojo|Morganphantom15}}

After all was said and done, she decided to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]], as if nothing ever happened, but lucky for us we have screenshots!

== I am a closet LESBIAN! ==
[[troll|Some]] deviants decided to point out to Morgan that her [[original character]] was a [[Mary Sue]], which lead to massive [[butthurt]] and [[moar]] hidden comments. If there is any [[For_Great_Justice|justice]] in the world, you will refuse to call her anything but a Mary Sue until she finally gets [[banhammer|banned]] for her generally immature behavior towards people who point out her [[faggotry]]. Of course when she <s>[http://comments.deviantart.com/1/79987371/683367584 points it out herself]</s> it makes things all the more lulzworthy that she is just that [[retard|retarded]].

{{quote| And I wil deny it casue I am not a Mary-fucking-sue!!!! It's my story, my fandom, my work, but it's not Mary-sue!!! |Morganphantom15 being [[butthurt]], per usual}}
