Internet military
{{elaw}} 
An '''Internet Military''' is a group of, well, [[fat|awesome]] [[Jews|fuckers]]. They are [[small|pathetic]], and are the internet equivalent of the [[13_year_old_girl|Israeli army]], because they [[fail|ruinate]] without the aid of mass numbers. [[unwarranted self importance|The sheer awesomeness packed into this small group makes them as effective as /b/ in sheer intimidation]] ([[shit nobody cares about|regardless of how unknown they are to everyone but themselves]]).

==Divisions==
[[Image:Penis Rubber Bands.jpg|thumb|The long training process involved.]]
;Scout
:Usually retired [[detective]]s, the scouting division of the Internet military will visit the target [[journal]] or [[site]] for [[reconnaissance]].

;Infantry
:The [[Internet]] infantry move in usually after an hour or so of scouting. Internet infantry act in an infant-like manner (see [[Infantilism]]), and usually attempt to annoy the hell out of either the site creator, posters, or visitors.

;Transport Division
:The transport division appear after a day of infantry movements, if the mission is still going (if not, they may show up anyways). The main goal of the transport division is to flood the page/forums with members, sometimes continuing the work of the Infantry, thereby continuing to bug the shit out of everyone and possibly crash the page.

;Flamers
:A step up from the Transport Division, the Flamers now get individual notoriety by [[flaming]] the users of the page in either outdated, retarded, or [[unfunny]] [[flame wars]]. [[Lulz]] ensues.

;Commander
:The Commander of an Internet Military is the one who orders the original attack, has the power to call it off, and is the only one authorized to "nuke" the site.

;Nukers
:These people are authorized by the Commander to "nuke" the site. Plain and simple, they either obliterate the servers or IP Bomb the creator/visitors. Loads of [[lulz]] ensue.

;Miners
:Miners [[lurk]] during the actual attack, but sow seeds to ensure future [[lulz]].
