IIRC
[[Image:IIRC-members.jpg|thumb|These guys are really important in the IIRC world.]]
The [[dubious disclaimer]] '''IIRC''' is an [[abbreviation]] of "If I remember/recall correctly". It is an obvious identifier of the [[Internet]] species of ''homo adloquor-natesis'' (Ass talkers).

Most often used on [[mailing list]]s to indicate some sort of superiority and [[condescension]] without actually taking responsibility for what one is saying. Commonly found in threads about [[e-lawyers|the law]] or [[computers]], and theoretically identical to responsibility shedding powers of [[Ianal]].
