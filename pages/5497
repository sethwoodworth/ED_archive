[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Morton_devonshire Morton Devonshire] is a sekrit agent and spie working at [[England|Airstrip One]], supposedly for the UK government, but more likely is a USA [[vapid twat|Republican]] pretending to be British, working for a [[Neocon|NeoCon]] "think-tank." Obviously, Morton Devonshire is not his actual name, which is way too faux-cheerio-mate to really be British. Besides, the English county of Devon is NOT called Devon'''shire'''. His job on Wikipedia is to wipe out all signs of "[[truth|cruft]]," or in other words, any alternative theories about [[9/11]], [[Jews]], [[Israel]], and virtually every other topic where the "official story" is doubted by non-NeoCons.

It's not really so interesting that he deletes all these "conspiracies," or arranges to get articles or categories deleted on TOW. That is actually no big deal, as Wikipedia is widely known to be 90% lies and nonsense anyway, and hundreds of universities have forbidden students to cite Wikipedia as a source. The fun part is that he was recently exposed in several major political magazines and web sites as a "disinformation agent," trying desperately to maintain a [[W|Bush]]-friendly perspective on the world.

One of his alter egos is "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rosenkreuz Rosenkreuz]."

Like many if not most of the [[Aspergers|hardcore]] Wikipedos, he claims to have a PhD. [[Essjay|This virtually guarantees that he does not actually have one]]. Interestingly, he also admits to having been "[[pedophilia|tutored by the Jesuits]]."

==Things he has fucked with==
An ever-growing list that he is [[Aspie|documenting himself]], on his Wikipedia page. These are his notes of  his achievements, and his comments about them. "Cruft" is Morton's word for anything that goes against US or Israeli policy. In most cases, he has arranged for these articles to be deleted; if not deleted, they are significantly weakened.
