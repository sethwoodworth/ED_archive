LJDrama is a whistleblowing organization and media watchdog collective headed up by [[hepkitten]].

[[Hepkitten]] created the LJDrama [[LiveJournal]] community on Jun. 20th, 2002 at or around 04:43 pm after her [[IRL]] drama erupted in her livejournal, causing her and her friends to joke about it. The [[livejournal]] community was eventually banned on Sept 26, 2002 for various breaches of the [[LJ TOS]]. At that point it was created as an independent website at [http://www.ljdrama.org ljdrama.org].

Occasionally, an event usually occurs when one or moar writers of the website doesn't get the desired attention to one of their "[[drama]]" articles.  They call those hissy fits, and they are typically reserved for [[bear]] and [[homosexual]] writers.

== Server Migration ==
The website itself was down over the 2004 holiday season due to some technical difficulties. [[girlvinyl]] let [[Hepkitten]] know that she and [[ghettofinger]] would be happy to host it on their [[linode]]. [[girlvinyl]] set up mail and services, while [[ghettofinger]] ported all of the previous [[Moveable Type]] data and comments into a fancy, new wordpress install. This new install is complete with a custom threading module to allow for threaded commenting, which LJDrama had not had before. It also allowed for [[user icons]] and various other features. 

The LJDrama site promptly crashed the puny [[linode]], thus [[linode]] management asked the site to find hosting elsewhere. Now LJDrama resides on a dedicated server farm, with plenty of room to run around and play.

==Current Status==
LJDrama.org is currently down. There has been some speculation as to the cause, and the general consensus is that [[Hep]] and [[girlvinyl]] are too busy  using their [[e-fame]] to score free [[hookers and blow]], rather than buttoning down with the code and getting back on board the [[lulz]] train.

Others contend that aforementioned speculation is bullshit, and that as ljdrama is [[old meme]], the wise moderators are watching it die while getting on with the [[hookers and blow]].

Either way, someone's getting [[hookers and blow]] out of this debacle.
