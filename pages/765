'''[http://www.freewebs.com/blt42/ BLT]''' is a group of [[retards]] who believe their [[Freewebs]] website and Invisionfree [[forum]] pwn all.

They originated as a [[unfunny|comedy group]], but after [[drama]] both on the [[internets]] and [[IRL]] the group left the fully hosted domain and its webmaster, [[Einsidler]], and became more of an [[fucktarded|online community]] using a poorly written Freewebs website. BLT encourages advertising their website because [[noone]] has enough [[skillz]] to create an Invisionfree. This online community has three regular members, two of which own an [[internets]].

== The Comedy Deli ==
'''[http://www.comedydeli.com Comedy Deli]''' is the fully hosted domain owned by [[Einsidler]] which was to serve as the BLT website. The website is now inactive and the [[wiki]] [[redirect]]s to [[Last Measure]] because of the fallout from the [[drama bomb]] that was dropped there. Due to Drask Terlier, founding member of BLT, being [[bisexual]], [[furry]], [[homophobic]], an [[asshole]], a [[redneck]] and mentally [[retarded]] an article on the wiki was made about him and how gay he was. Similar articles were produced about other members, as generally comedy groups have a sense of humour.

The problem however was that Drask had a butch [[lesbian]] [[furry]] friend who has [[wikipedia|no sense of humour]] who went in and 'corrected' the articles by a process known as [[frunz]]. Mostly because the wiki had called Drask's emofur [[boyfriend]] (that he met on [[Pounced dot org]]) a [[fag]]. After reverting all [[vandalism]], a wave of vandalism started in which her and her [[black]] brother fucked with the whole wiki, Einsidler's livejournal, and the Comedy Deli comment system. Spamming shit and [[photoshop]]ped images.

While on the internet, expecially with root access, the problem was contained. However, the [[drama]]s followed over into [[IRL]]. The result of which Einsidler was left with [[no friends]] and a mental breakdown. The events where breifly summarised by the [http://xsoldierdarkmana.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!AE03E1D03E8F560E!418.entry a whinging blog entry] in one of the observers [[MSN Spaces|MSN space]]. Of course he is a brown-noser, and took the side of who he saw as the top of the pecking order, the [[furry]].

[[Image:Bltohnoes.png|thumb|450px|[[Oh noes]], all 2 people who read this website are going to [[Fail|vandalize ED]]]]
The newly re-formed BLT, consisting of the [[midget]], the [[furry]] and a few other [[moron]]s created a website that even [[geocities]] would be ashamed of, and a [http://z9.invisionfree.com/BLT_Forums free-hosted forum] to go with it. All the 'articles' written for the site were [[2 gryphon|furry rants]], mostly just [http://www.freewebs.com/draskterleir/Article11.htm bitching] [http://www.freewebs.com/draskterleir/Article13.htm about] [http://www.freewebs.com/draskterleir/Article14.htm Einsidler].

BLT has shown a considerable '[[lulz|hatred of EncyclopÃ¦dia Dramatica]]' and they even claimed it is "Full of hypocrites, homophobes and assholes"  on their [http://www.freewebs.com/blt42/HateList.htm hate list], a page consisting of three links including one [[Last Measure]]. [[Oh noes]]. BLT threatens to [[ShutdownED.org|bring down ED]] using their mighty army of three people, two of which have [[internets]] connection. [[Duke Otterland|Anyone who critises them is treated to a bitching rant]] such as this [http://www.freewebs.com/draskterleir/Article16.htm reply to Sheneequa]:
:Ok try this on for size [[Sheneequa]]! You say it's bullshit the way I compare the Gay/Bi situation to the jews and black right? Let's explore that shall we? -[[emo|My family hates me]] because they found out [[bisexual|what I am]] -My [[gay|boyfriend]] is [[Australia|400ks]] away -[[Einsidler|One of my "friends"]] decided to tell the rest of the fucking school so now I'm [[emo|outcast]] And just to top it all off, I have [[Sheneequa|some loudmouth bitch]] telling me how to complain!Your from [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] correct? This means you fall into the nErD [[stereotype]]. Fat, pimply, glasses wearing nerds. So how bout this. How bout you pick up your [[fat]] rolls from where they drape around your feet, tuck them into your belt, pickup your toasted lard sandwich and [[GTFO|GET THE FUCK OFF]] MY [[serious business|WEBSITE]]! I don't give a fatass shit how [[Font size=5|badly written]] it is! I don't have time to bother with learning a good website ok? I have [[buttsecks|a "Life"]] outside of the internet, as [[divide by zero|mind boggling]] as that concept may be. So [[masturbation|go fuck yourself]]. Oh and [[Einsidler|Hypocrite]], thanks for inviting [[Sheneequa|your ED hores]] to my website. This just proves my point of how much of a [[an hero|coward]] you really are. So bring it on bitches! Because I will [[Duke Otterland|beat down each and every dumb fuck who insults me and my website]]. So come on!I'm waiting. Deal with it! h3>

Another anti-ED rant was posted as a [http://z9.invisionfree.com/BLT_Forums/index.php?showtopic=166&view=findpost&p=4341820 welcome to a new user] on the [[forum]] from "Mista Majikal Moshos", a [[midget]]:

:If you aren't from that '''buttfuck collection of loner, lowlife, cuntsacks who hate everything non-academic cause they can't do anything other than formulae and bitching''' known as ED then you are most welcome.
:If you are from ED, then you are a '''whiny asskisser with no opinon of his and/or her own, who relys on what a couple of unsuccsesful buttfucks tell them, and take it as definite truth (i.e. 3insidler)''' then you are not welcome. We already have two trolls, whom are currently engaged in Mortal Kombat for the title of token troll.
:Of course If you do visit ED once in a while but '''don't worship it or turn it into a holy documentation (which is what 3insidler does, proved by his personality and philosophies which are copied from ED, and the fact that he wanted his wiki to be exactly the same as ED by making articles anti-anything non-academic related, so that the mods could passionatly fuck him up the ass as a reward) and don't take the shit it says seriously (3insidler takes it 74950.62381% seriously),''' then you're welcome.
:P.S. The people who frequent ED are '''highly unsuccsesful''' in non-academic areas, therfore hating '''anything''' social, emotional or generally non-uber math/science nerd-related stuff such as feelings, freindship, values, culture, life, tradition, family, faith, imagination, etc.

All he said was 'Hiya,' but they are under a [[paranoid]] delution that the new member is [[Ket]]
We, at ED still don't know what "freindship" is.
