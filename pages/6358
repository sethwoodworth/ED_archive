'''Perth''' is a city in the middle of fucking nowhere (or as the Australians themselves say, "[[buttsecks|bum fuck]] nowhere") on the beach in Western [[Australia]]. It is one of only seven or eight <s>civilized</s> settlements on the [[XBox|huge]] and [[centipedes|dangerous]] desert continent, and is internationally known as "The Land of Fires, Floods and Flies." Each year, the majority of Australia's buzzing set take their holiday from the endless deserts and descend upon Perth.

In the 21st century, Perth is a place so lovely that its native sons and daughters who live for any long-ish period in other parts of the world frequently die of [[Charmaine Dragun|homesickness]], or become so homesick that [[Heath Ledger|they kill themselves]]. Scientists and doctors worldwide are baffled by this phenomena, as Perth is a regular contender for [[fact|MOST BORING PLACE TO LIVE EVAR]].

==History==

Perth was founded in the 19th century by [[Prison_rape | convicts]] who had been exiled in disgrace from the convict colonies of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]], on the opposite side of the country. Back in those days it was known as the [[Bong]] River colony, ruled by the dictator John Forrest.

1933, Perth citizens had an opportunity to go to war with the rest of Australia. They didn't--and now they are forever CANBERRA's [[bitch | BITCH]].

In 1984, Perth constructed its first power plant, supplying the local electricity needs. Previously electricity had to be shipped in from Singapore and sold at high costs to consumers.

1987 was an important year for Perth (and more importantly Fremantle) when convicted drug dealer Alan Bond paid the worlds Cartographers to include both towns on all future maps.

==People==

Perth is made up of various peoples, from bogans to yobbos. Lucky for you Perth is too far away for them to be of any concern to the rest of the world. Not to say that they won't [[rape]] and [[murder]] you if you make eye contact. Perth people are also IRL [[newbs]], or '''poobs'''. Any music that doesn't sound like Aye-See-Dick-See is automatically branded as techno. Jazz is techno too and so is classical.

In Perth you can enjoy a unique lifestyle where your amputated left arm, right leg and your firstborn child can be traded for a pint of cat urine a.k.a. domestic beer and one weeks rent in an apartment nearly 1% bigger then a [[jail]] cell. Cardboard boxes don't come cheap these days and thus require renovation. Perth is also home to the friendliest Aboriginal who pimp your ride by smashing all your car windows in return for stealing [[you|your]] [[shit]].

Famous people from Perth include [[Snapesnogger]], [[Heath Ledger|The Joker]], and the Claremont Serial Killer, a "true legend" (in local colliquial terms) who butchered a bunch of strippers and has still evaded capture. This can be explained by Perth's strong convict stock of murderous masterminds and half-arsed police force who plan on quitting when CCTV technology finally arrives to Perth via [[Londonistan]].

==Sport==

The most common sport in Perth is [[sodomy | Australian Football]], or Foody, as it is known in the [[bogan | local]] dialect. Perth has a team in the national competition called the West Coke Eagles, who get [[raped | buthurt]] by their main rivals the Freo Dongers.
