You'd think that a radical [[Pagan]] [[vampire]] [[Magick|warlock]] ninja [[Conspiracy|ufo-conspiracy theorist]] couldn't possibly get any crazier. And you'd be wrong. He could always [[Lolwut|think that he is a superhero]].

James Paul Von Helton has the dubious distinction of having crammed more [[insane]] bullshit into his head than any other person in the world. Most online nutjobs are content to JUST think that the aliens are out to get them, or that their surgeon wants to kill them for being a [[Jennifer Diane Reitz|transsexual]], VonHelton goes the extra mile to incorporate absolutely everything into his crazy fantasy world. However, the thing that really makes VonHelton stand out from the teeming masses of the internet is that he believes that he is the Marvel comic book character, [[Fag|The Punisher]].

Yes, [[Fact|really]].

==History(The Crazy Version)==
VonHelton was a child prodigy who [[lie|invented]] the stealth fighter when he was seven. He joined the military and was quickly recruited for top secret work in the special forces. He was happily married until [[Incest|one of his children miscarried]], and the other died shortly after birth. He discovered that this was done by [[User:Killhamster|Satanic new world order agents]], so, after his wife's cousin brainwashed her into divorcing him, VonHelton briefly joined a satanic cult which sacrificed babies to the devil. Later, he wandered the country fighting [[Niggers|criminals]], and demons, eventually learning that he was, in fact, a vampire. After years of working as a vigilante, he finally retired to a trailer in his [[Basement-dweller|mom's backyard]] to study majik and warn people about the new world order.

==History(The Non-Crazy Version)==
VonHelton dropped out of college, was kicked out of the army for being a [[Retard|fuck up]], and spent most of his life working in his parents' nursing home. Then he found the internet, and discovered he could forget about what a [[Fail|failure]] his life was by pretending to be a [[Internet Tough Guy|badass]] online. And thus a never ending saga of [[drama]] began.

===About.com===
VonHelton first reared his head on the [[Atheist]]/Agnostic board on About. He made perfectly reasonable posts about how he could raise the dead and generally telling them how they would burn in hell. As the flame wars escalated, he began to openly anticipate the apocalypse, during which his online enemies would be turned into [[Peter_Chimaera#DOOM:_Repercussions_of_Evil|demonized zombies]], which he could then kill. When no one was intimidated, he quietly left the site and converted back to paganism.

===Delphi Forums===
Von branched out into multiple subcultures on Delphi, becoming a part of the vampire, pagan, and science fiction communities. This is when he first mentions his vampirism and majik skills. He desperately tried to use this to get sex from fat goth chicks, whining about how he was a lonely creature of the night and ranting about how girls he met online were one of his [[Unrealistic Expectations|two]] "vampire soul mates" and needed to drink his blood to finish their transformation. He finally managed to lure one [[16-year-old girl]] from Canada to his trailer for hawt vampire [[Rape|sex]]

Meanwhile, real soldiers and martial arts enthusiasts were getting tired of VonHelton claiming to be a master ninja and ex-special forces agent. They called him out on it, which resulted in several epic [[TL;DR|thousand post long]] threads. Evidence of Von being a liar was posted. Death threats were made. [[Lolsuit]]s were filed. People were challenged to ninja duels. Someone called VonHelton's neighbors and [[EPIC|told them he was a "vampire"]]. In short, [[lulz]] were had by all. VonHelton responded by claiming that they used black majik to kill his cat and tried to have him assassinated by the government for falsely claiming to have been in the special forces. This dragged on for years, until he was finally banned.

===Youtube===

VonHelton finally found a group that would put up with his [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissism]]: conspiracy theorists. By focusing on bullshit they already believed, he was able to feel important without alienating anyone. The typical VonHelton video is [[tl;dr|40 minutes long]] and involves reading an online article to his presumably illiterate fans, then repeating the same few phrases [[Over 9000|several]] times. He also does really [[shit]]ty karaoke.

===Rappelz===
Like every other social reject on the internet, VonHelton eventually started playing a [[MMORPG]]. He bragged that he could defeat players who were a much higher level than him, with [[Pwnt|predictable results]]. This led to a crusade against the PvP system, claiming that the "extra code" to allow for PvP combat slowed down the server. After the entire player base told him to [[STFU]], he threatened to fly to Korea to personally have the developers remove PvP and ban everyone who had disagreed with him. He eventually quit Rappelz and [[Bullshit|3000 other players left with him in solidarity]]. He then joined CABAL online, where he [[Idiot|did the exact same thing]] all over again.

===BlogTV===
Von once had a [[blogTV]] channel, also ostensibly about aliens and conspiracies. However, it was mostly just "watch VonHelton sit in front of his computer talking about boring shit all day," occasionally broken up by trolls. He was also feeling especially lonely, and kept trying to get women to come to his house in preparation for solar storm that will destroy the world, so that he could [[Rape|protect]] them. This made it ridiculously easy for trolls pretending to women to get channel operator status or be given his cohost spot, which lead to much [[lulz]]. After complaints about him being a racist hate monger, His account was temporarily suspended, and, when he got it back, he immediately went on a screaming rant about how Muslims had been killing people for [[At least 100 years ago|billions of years]]. He responded to the ensuing [[ban]]ning of his account the way any sane person would, by calling the [[Party Van|FBI]], CIA, KGB, and Mossad, and trying to have blogTV shut down for running a [[CP|child pornography]] ring. 

==MS 13==
[[Image:InternetGangster.jpg|thumb|left|An internet gangster, uploading a hate filled video to Youtube]]
[[Last Thursday|Once upon a time]] VonHelton was the cohost for some [[asian]] [[camwhore]] on blogTV, and was, of course, being mocked for his obvious insanity. He told the camwhore to ignore the trolls, because they were "...probably from MS 13." Shocked that [[Retard|VonHelton]] had figured out who they were, the trolls admitted they were from the vicious [[Spics|latino]] street gang. They were seeking revenge for what VonHelton had done to their gang as The Punisher by [[Troll|making fun of him on the internet]]. MS 13 soon began uploading compilations of the [[lulz]]y parts of his videos. They were mostly ignored, until VonHelton released a video claiming he was sterile, as an excuse for why he shouldn't pay child support for his bastard son. Unfortunately, he forgot that little detail about how his children's deaths were what caused him to become the Punisher in the first place. [[Fail|Oops]]. MS 13 posted a video pointing this out, and VonHelton responded by daring his [[H8r|haters]] to accompany him to Dubai in order to free sex slaves and PUNISH their owners.

MS 13 called his bluff, and readily agreed to fly to the middle east to free some fucking slaves. It remains to be seen how he will weasel out of this one. 

Known members of MS 13 include central American crime lord Juan Pedito and [[Boxxy]]
