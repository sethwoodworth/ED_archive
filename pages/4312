The story of <s>Jeff</s> '''Jett Travolta''' broke on the [[WWP]] forums in the sleepy, hungover newness of January 2nd, 2009. As soon as [[anonymous|anon]] finished doing the Happy Protest Circlejerk at the [[win|news]] of another [[scientology|Scientology]] [[murder|family death]] (two or three days later), the actual [[lie|details]] of the case started to filter through the bleating headlines. Accusations of neglect immediately arose en masse from uneducated youtube commentfags about how Jett was a [[I See What You Did There|helmetless Kawasaki rider]]. Because hey, we all know [[Scientology|Scilons]] are the same thing as [[Insane|Jehovah's Witnesses]] right? 

==An Hero==

Jett Travolta may well hold the honour of being the first true [[An Hero]] of 2009. However, the question remains: [[Mitchell Henderson|did John steal his iPod?]] Is drowning in a bath as [[lulz|lulzy]] as drowning in a [[Codey Porter|sandbox]]? Only Jew will tell.

According to secret internal Scientology memos, Jett learned the secret of [[Xenu|OTIII]] too early and as [[Hubbard]] said, OTIII is designed to kill by pneumonia anyone who uncovers it.  This was also what happened to Lisa McPherson.

==No One Knows SHIT==

Yahoo news links would have us believe that on December 2nd Jett Travolta, whilst on holiday in the [[Freewinds|Bahamas]], had gone to [[Masturbation|take a shit]] the [[At least 100 years ago|previous night]] and been found dead the [[Last Thursday|following morning]] having apparently hit his head on the bath due to a [[Epilepsy|seizure]].

Anonymous cried foul, but the press had already ''seized'' (DO U C WUT I DID THERE) on the controversy surrounding the family's long-running and plaintive denial that Jett was [[Retard|autistic]], instead insisting that he had [[Bullshit|Kawasaki's Disease]], a childhood malady of the [[Cock|blood vessels]].

Cloudy water turned to muddy turned to shitty. Self-diagnosed [[aspie]]s RAAAAAAGEd about how it was TERRIBLE that the Travoltas would not admit their SHAME to the world, and anyway THEY were autistic and they could TELL from Jett's face. Anons who actually had Kawasaki themselves scratched their heads and said "Wait guise, it doesn't do that," although it was later revealed that they had confused the condition with '''KAWAIIDESUNE ^_^''' disease (which merely makes the user wear a ninja head protector and neko ears).

If there was one thing everyone could agree on, however, it was this: If Jett was found dead in the bathroom the following morning, [[hookers and blow|what the hell were his overpaid caregivers doing?]]

Then it was announced that they would be flying back to the state of Florida (prop. David Miscavige) for the inquiry, and everyone was like O WTF.

On the 4th of January, Travolta was questioned. Naturally they had the perfect cover story, communicated by their lawyers and a tearful John. They had found Jett just after the accident, on the morning of the 2nd. He was still alive, and died in his father's arms as they tearfully tried to revive him. Beautiful. Truly, the stuff of which Hallmark Channel TVMs are made. Except for one thing.

The "This Shit Is Bahamas" Police are sticking to their version of events.

Uh-oh.

==The Castor Troy Connection==

[[John Travolta]] was The [[Lol-cow|Elvis]] of the disco generation with his [[Terri Schiavo|cleft lip facial expressions]] and [[KKK|white man]] dickswing. Most [[faggots]] become enraged when they see a successful male stay on the right side of the bar, and Nicholas Cage is no exception to this rule. Combine a dickfag's thirst for cock with career jealousy, and you have a recipe for RL trolling.

Nicholas Cage was always second best to John Travolta. He was beaten out by him for the role of Danny Zuko in Grease, and Quentin Tarantino chose Travolta over him for a lead role in Pulp Fiction as well. Cage had to take a [[buttsecks|backdoor pounding]] with the role of "The Gimp" in the blockbuster movie. But in the late 90's Cage got his chance to take the reins from Travolta for the first time. He was hired to kill Travolta's son in the movie Face/Off. Cage became an evil [[terrorist|hi-tech]] Timothy McVeigh, training to kill in the flatlands of southern [[Indiana]]. He became so awesome that he was given Travolta's role in the movie, but it was at a price. Cage ended up realizing that he was just acting in a movie.

Cage became obsessed with everything about Travolta. He bought his old cars and any [[fleshlight|memorabilia]] he could find of his. He even married his daughter Priscilla Presley so he could taste Travolta's genes. But when she decided she should be fucking Michael Jackson he knew he had been duped into porking an [[Transgender|inverted penis]] [[Pwnt|all along]]. 

Being the [[Lol-cow|Elvis]] fanatic he now was, and still a [[fag]], Troy then attempted a relationship with Presley's son Jett. The encounter, which lasted only 30 seconds, ended with Jett becoming an hero after realizing Cage used his cock to [[Incest|pork his own sister]] Lisa Marie Presley. One taste of his own DNA off of Cage's cock, and realizing that Lisa Marie had probably been fucking Michael Jackson while boning Cage, was just too much for any 13 year old boy to handle. He deep throated a bottle of Valtrex and drowned in his own carbuncle discharge.

== The Boyfriend Did It ==
[[Image:Travolta_Fag_Kiss.jpg|thumb|right|The real killer]]
According to a [http://gawker.com/5122788/travoltas-rumored-gay-lover-discovered-dead-son?skyline=true&s=x Gawker] article, [[retard|Jett]] was found by [[John Travolta]]'s secret [[gay]] lover Jeff Katerin.  Katerin is supposedly the [[pedophile|caretaker]] for the little tard, however, on Katerin's [http://jeffkathrein.com/?page_id=2 website] he describes himself as a professional photographer who enjoys [[fail|electric skateboards]], buttsecks and hanging out with his [[lie|wife]] [[Ana]].  This [[some argue|leads one to wonder]] if the closet fag [[raped|did]] Jett in because he was too old to be [[pedo]] material anymore, or maybe because [[retards]] require a lot of [[attention whore|attention]] which would keep the [[faggots|lovebirds]] apart, or possibly he was [[kill|killed]] as a form of [[money|tribute]] to the all mighty [[scientology|Xenu]].  [[Bitches_Don't_Know|We may never know]].

==Kawasaki Disease==

Kawasaki Disease is an illness that involves the skin, mouth, and lymph nodes. Kawasaki disease can't be prevented but it can be picked up at your local Kawasaki dealer; so let the good times roll. Jett Travolta [http://www.kawasaki.com/Products/Watercraft.aspx hit the water hard, and hit the bathtub harder.] He is a true [[an hero]], comparable to the likes of [[Budd Dwyer]] except not as [[lulzy]]. 

Kawasaki disease occurs in 19 out of every 100,000 babies in the United States.  It never occurs in teenagers unless they never get any medical treatment for it.  It has telltale symptoms, such as:

* Being [[retard|retarded]]
* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADnHzvQNW-k&feature=related Hey, It's me; John Travolta]
* Scientology
* Seizures
* Riding your brand new Ninja ZX-6R in a bathtub.
* Niacin


==Shooped Photos==
Some of the photos that were publicized in media outlets after Jett's death were found out to have been [http://gawker.com/5125778/john-travolta-grieving-and-deceiving shooped]. It goes to show that Scifags fail at [[Photoshop]].
