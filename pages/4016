Indiana
[[Image:Indiana sign.jpg|thumb|right]]
Indiana is a mythical land somewhere in the [[United States of America]] that is home to corn, [[redneck]]s, [[Christian]]s, cats, drag racing and [[meth]]. Indiana is a <strike>proud</strike> '''former''' (as of [[Last Thursday|Last Tuesday]]) member of the [[Dumbfuckistan]] province of America. Nothing happens in Indiana. It is commonly known to [[Americunt|Americans]] as the ''"are we there yet?"'' state, [[truth|because every highway in America goes through Indiana]].

==People==
[[Image:Redneck.jpg|thumb|A "Who’s yer". Note the lack of a nose and overalls.]]
[[Image:revisedmapofindiana.jpg|thumb|Indiana as of 2009.]]

Indiana's biggest bluff is the fact that it has the highest percent population of [[redneck]]s of any non-Southern state. A significant number of [[niggers|black people]] and [[Mexico|Mexicans]] also live in certain areas but the only reason why they are allowed to is because they make up the bulk of the Pacers basketball team, since everybody knows that [[Whitey]] can’t jump.

Indiana residents are called "Hoosiers" due to the fact that nobody knows how to pronounce "Indianan". [[Some argue]] that the term originates from asking visitors "Who'sh 'ere?" while others claim it refers to frontiersmen constantly [[flame war|brawling]] with each other and having to ask "Whose ear?" they bit off to keep track of things. In reality, it comes from all of the raunchy, [[incest]]uous sex that Indiana men had with their sisters/cousins/daughters, constantly yelling, [[List of sex moves#Tony Danza|"Who’s yer daddy?"]] during this. The term caught on quickly and is still used today, despite the fact that in the rest of the Midwest (in fact, the rest of the world), "Hoosier" is used to refer to [[fat]], smelly, [[white trash]]. Pointing this out to a Hoosier is a terrific [[IRL]] [[drama-generating technique]], unless they are not white trash; then they will just shrug and agree with you.

==Culture==
[[Image:Indiana-dunes.jpg|thumb|The typical view of Indiana from the Wabash river.]]
Indiana culture revolves around four things: corn, basketball, [[drug|meth labs]], and [[NASCAR]]. Other pastimes include:
* Growing corn
* Harvesting corn
* Eating corn flakes
* Making cornbread
* Shitting in cornfields
* Raping daughters
* Raping Sons
* Raping livestock
* Licking Poop
* Pretending to be relevant
* Leading the world in redneck fashion

* Stupidity

* Outcasts from all other states (Indiana Government)

==Cities==
Indiana has no cities, just bumfuckistan farmtowns and the occasional gas station. The closest thing to a metropolitan area is the capital of Indiana, Indianapolis.  It is nothing more than a Indy Car motor speedway surrounded by a series of trailer parks occupied by [[rednecks]] and more [[rednecks]]. These two groups often use chainsaw fights to choose which piece of wood they'd like to live under. The north side of Indianapolis is inhabited by [[indie]] fucks and rich people that [[baw]] about being from Indiana and how no one intellectual lives in Indiana. All of these people [[fap]] to pictures of [[Chicago]]

*South Bend is just one gigantic goddamn fucking homeless shelter, with the occasional off-Broadway show like "Ingrown Pubic Hairs: The Musical" and rumors are they have a football team there.

*Jasper is the wood capital of the world, without the aid of [[Viagra]]. Their high school basketball team sucks so much, their only state championship was in 1949. They have an annual festival called "Strassenfest", which is German for Mardi Gras.

*Evansville is one of those major cities without fancy buildings. Instead, it's strewn with shitloads of highways, Fucktons of minimalls and will have a clover-shaped road on the way.

*Michigan City is a casino full of fail and a beach with hillbillies crawling on it like crabs. There is also a strip mall that has MOAR [[Azn|AZNS]] than Aza.

*Fort Wayne is the site of an [[science|elaborate experiment]] to see if hillbillies and rednecks have the will to attempt [[buttsecks|assimilation]] with trailer trash. [[FAIL|It is going quite well]], so well in fact that small [[fleshlight|injection molding]] and [http://www.verabradley.com/Site/Store/ViewCategory.aspx?colorid=10 quilted purse factories for rich bitches] are putting [[Detroit|General Motors]] [[Depression|out of business]]. 

*Terre Haute is a [[Retarded|special]] city in Vigo County.  It's pronounced ''Veego'', not ''Veyego'' like some dumbfucks do.  It was once inhabited by Larry Bird (he went to school there) and witnessed the execution of Timothy McVeigh (yay?).  It has also been thoroughly dissed by Steve Martin at least 100 years ago.  Terre Haute is also well-known by its fragrance, detectable from passers-by driving through on the Interstate, which comprises a distinct mixture of creosote, paper mill, and shit.  Terre Haute is also home to true patriot Kevin Orpurt, the Channel 10 weatherman.

Most of the Chicago metro area lies in northwest Indiana. Indiana is not allowed to collect taxes from anyone living or working in this metro area. Instead they are paid billions of dollars by Illinois to allow Chicago's trash to be dumped in the pumped out swamplands of Lake and Newton counties. This process gives Chicago's large gypsy population income to buy wifebeaters too small for them by hauling the medically condemned filth to it's destination.

Some people claim that Gary is also a major city but this is a [[lie]] since it is actually just a large public housing project owned by [[Chicago]] for the black person.  The only reason Chicago tolerates its existence is because it's much easier to open casinos in Indiana and cigarettes and gas are cheaper there.

==Time Zone==
Indiana can't actually [http://www.timetemperature.com/tzus/indiana_time_zone.shtml make up its mind] what time zone to be in. 
{{quote|Most of Indiana is in the Eastern Time Zone.|[[WTF|''Most''?]]}}

This is a significant improvement for the state. Until 2006, most of Indiana refused to accept Daylight Saving Time. The effect of some regions being in CDT, EDT, and EST simultaneously meant there were literally five distinct time zones in this one state.  The website, [http://www.mccsc.edu/time.html What Time Is It In Indiana?] although humorously titled, had been a valuable tool for figuring out what the fuck.

==Weather==
Summer: Uncomfortably warm and sticky. Like your creepy uncle who likes to touch.

Fall: See Winter.

Winter: Like a perpetual ice hurricane that exists only to make you fantasize about how the dead feel no pain. Reduces homeless population by 70%.

Spring: See Winter.

==Indiana Official State Motto==

"I was born in a small town. Learned to masturbate in a small town. Sister got pregnant in a small town, everybody blamed it on me!"


==Education==

===Indiana University (IU)===
 
Indiana's pride and joy is located in a landfill called Bloomington, Indiana. IU a university comprised mostly of ignorant Indiana hillbillies, rednecks, and trailer trash who couldn't learn to read or write with their primary and secondary educations.  IU also attracts a few mental rejects from neighboring states who couldn't get accepted at universities located within their own states. The rejects from surrounding states typically raised the overall intelligence level of IU, and they are always the Valedictorians and Salutatorians of IU's graduating classes.  
	
Indiana University is known for the basketball championships that it purchased from the NCAA.  IU Administrators and Coaches send their daughters every year to seduce NCAA officials with sex and money. They then  blackmail the NCAA officials into giving them basketball championships.  Unfortunately the daughters they've sent were only attractive enough on just 5 occasions, even though the daughters have been sent every single year since the beginning of the tournament. A little known fact is that on those 5 occasions the NCAA officials had been at all day celebrations with an open bar, and were sufficiently inebriated.

===Purdue University===
Purdue fancies itself to be better than the shithole IU is. Located in the middle of fucking nowhere surrounded by nothing but a fucking starbuck, redneck, hippies and hobos. Purdue is proud to have enough retards to survive a fucking zombie invasion by walling the university with engineering students. Most Purdue students are foreign brown people who could not get into a real university.
