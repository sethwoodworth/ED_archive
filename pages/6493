[[Image:Ash pikachu.jpg|thumb|The infamous scene where Ash was turned into a Pikachu and realized his [[furry|dreams]] would come true.]]

'''Pokémon''' started out as just a humble [[video game|Game Boy game]], but it soon bloated into a massive [[cult]] that recruited 9-year-olds who fap'd to teh pokémonz along with [[Anime|a shitty TV show]], a card game, consecutive video games, [[plushie|stuffed animals]], bedsheets, movies, plastic toys made in [[China]], thongs, condoms and some very disturbing [[hentai]] and marital [[aids]]. The whole thing ended when the cult had a final stand-off with the government in [[Waco]]. What was left of the once noble franchise was soon [[rape]]d to death by [[Yu-Gi-Oh]] cards. 

The final nail in the coffin of Pokémon's popularity is the [[fact]] that [[wikipedophile]]s place articles about them on the front page (for example, [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Today's featured article/July 28, 2006|here]]), and that [[shit nobody cares about|all the original voice actors of the anime have been fired]].

==Video games==
[[File:Pikachoke.png|thumb|right|[[Pikaman|New Pokémon, officially confirmed for Black/White.]]]]
Note that, although [[Nintendo]] [[conspiracy|claims]] to sell several versions of each game, each is really identical, and it is all a [[capitalism|ploy]] to sell more cartridges, link cables, and wireless adapters. The sequels are also all the same game, just the old main character is [[murder|killed off]] and replaced, and new [[animals|Pokémon]] are [[nakedgirlparts|unveiled]].

===[[Old meme|Red and Blue]]===
The original video games are [[fact|actually pretty good]], that is, if you like [[shit|shitty]] [[graphics]], extreme [[virus|glitchiness]], and [[bestiality]]. It was created by an [[otaku]] who enjoyed collecting [[STD|bugs]], and so, the object of the game is for you to catch [[babyfur|cute little animals]] with [[Poke]][[ball]]s and force them to murder each other in battle. To [[win]], one must also obtain all the PokéGods, secret Pokémon that have [[digimon|Digivolved]] to the highest level, such as [[Mew]], [[Zapatero|Zapdos]], and Proxy-Connection: keep-alive Cache-Control: max-age=0. These Pokémon are unlocked by releasing all your Pokémon after defeating the [[Leet|Elite]] Four exactly [[satan|666]] times and then using the [[Phishing|Super Rod]] repeatedly behind the [[Easter Egg]] truck.

There was a secret cheat you could get to catch a character called [[Candlejack|"MissingNo"]], a [[doing it wrong|glitch]] in the gameplay, allowing you to clone items and have Pokémon with max [[over 9000|power levels]]. Doing this eventually [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|wipes your game save]], and not only that, if you use your Nintendo Game Boy connect cable to trade these glitch Pokémon with your [[BFF|best friend]], it will also rape their game save as well. This has been compared to the Pokémon equivalent of [[AIDS]] by [[basement-dweller|leading scholars]], because they both result in certain [[death]] of the infected target.

===[[Jew Gold|Gold and Silver]]===
Quite literally exact copies of the original games, only with [[MS Paint|rearranged cities]], black person, the [[Lie|infamous Misty skinny-dipping cut scene]], and a bunch of new Pokémon such as [[Troll|Bluchu]] and [[Abortion|Togepi]] and [[moar]] PokéGods like [[ho|Ho-oh]]. This cycle would repeat several times over, each time adding better graphics and more Pokémon, but never actually evolving the gameplay or plot in the slightest.

These games also introduced the concept of Pokémon [[secks|breeding]], which makes all of the Pokémon-on-Pokémon [[Rule 34]] ever conceived technically [[canon]].

On a side note: There USED to be a really cool character named [[Silverop|Silver]]. He was the only rival that ever pounded your face in for talking to him before he got his pokemon. As if he wasn't badass enough for pounding the hero's cockcraving face in he was the original Team Rocket leader's kid. In HeartGold SoulSilver he got a new look. However he was compeltely ruined when he was turned Neko by a furry (Raiden73 or as he likes to be called Gyro Gun; to all Silver fans, download Byond and troll the fuck out of this scum).

===[[Ruby on Rails|Ruby and Sapphire]]===
The next games in the series came out for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. They featured new villains, [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force|Team Aqua]] and [[Smegma|Team Magma]], who think [[global warming]] is a good thing. The only positive aspect of these games was the introduction of [[Mudkips]].

===[[Copypasta|FireRed and LeafGreen]]===
Basically Pokémon Red and Blue committing [[samefag]]gotry, these games are the same thing as the [[90s]] originals, but with GBA graphics, and some seven new islands full of [[Muslims]].

===[[Uncut diamond|Diamond]] and [[Perl|Pearl]]===
[[Image:Vinewhip.gif|thumb|I'd whip that.]]
These latest sequels in the Pokémon franchise add connectability with [[teh]] [[internet]]s, so you can trade your Mewtwo for a [[crap|Magikrap]] from around the world[[oneoneone|!!!111]] You can also download Ash x Gary [[yaoi]] straight to your [[Nintendo DS]]. Just be sure to carry a strong anti-virus Pokémon in your party at all times, or you risk being [[pwnt]] by a wild virus Pokémon encountered on the tubes. 

They also feature [[Cynthia]] as the <s>Pokémon League Champion</s> whiny emo bitch, her existence the result of mass [[controversy]] and [[butthurt]] amongst [[Nintendo]]. She is an avid fan of trolling by using her favourite Pokemanz, Trollchomp, which can easily troll unsuspecting Empoleon by using Earthquake and Brick Break - LAWLZ IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE!!!111

===[[Nostalgia|HeartGold and SoulSilver]]===
[[File:Typical Pokeathlon event.gif|thumb|left|[[Buttsecks|Typical Pokeathlon event]].]]
[[File:Rivalrapeslyra.jpg|thumb|[[I CAME]]!]]


[[Last Thursday]], after many rumors were circulated on the tubes, Nintendo confirmed that there would indeed be remakes of the [[shit|hit]] games [[Gold|Gold and Silver]] for the [[DS]]. The games have features such as [[stalker|letting any of your Pokémon follow you around]], a [[Goatse|wide variety]] of Generation II Pokémon, and [[Sonic the Hedgehog|pseudo-3D graphics]]. Basically, the new games are just a giant clusterfuck of [[fail]] produced from merging half of the old games together and adding [[shit nobody cares about|useless features]] like the [[Olympics|Pokeathlon]] and the [[nobody cares|Spiky eared Pichu]], but as soon as this piece of news was released on the internet, [[nostalgia]]fags everywhere creamed their pants. The only thing of relevance to come out of these games is the scene where the rival [[rape]]s you in Goldenrod City and leaves what's left of your semen-filled anus for Team Rocket.

The latest Pokemonz game, now released in Japan and is set to be released in the U.S. during [[2012|the apocalypse]]. It is the first one [[bullshit|with real 3-D graphics]] and the Pokemon professor, [[whore|Dr. Araragi]] is an [[cougar|older woman]]. You travel across the [[New York|Unova]] region, [[Jewnited States of Americunts|far away]] from [[Japan|the other Pokemon regions]]. This time, rather than playing as some [[Loli|snot-nosed 10-year old]], you begin the game as either a [[16-year-old girls|bratty teenage bitch]] or as an [[unoriginal|older version of Ash]]. When you pick your starter, you can choose a fire [[pig]], [[Smugleaf]], or a water, um, [[WTF|baby clown]]. [[Copypasta|However, you still go through the same shit as the other games, AGAIN.]] You now have two rivals, a [[Retard|blonde bimbo]] and an [[Azn|azn.]] It is your responsibility to [[pwn|defeat]] [[PETA|Team Plasma]], [[PETA|whose goal is to free all pokemon from the world for some stupid unexplained reason.]] Some [[Anime|green haired]] [[Hippie|faggot]] [[Batshit Insane|that claims to hear pokeyman's voices]] [[GTFO|bugs the shit out of you]] until the end of the game where he [[RAGE|rages]] at your faggotry and gets [[FYIAD| Reshiram's]]/[[FYIAD| Zekrom's]] mighty dick to [[rape|brutally rape]] your puny asshole.

.. Oh, and some of the new gym leaders ([[Sheneequa|Aloe]], [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon|Shaga]], and [[Starlaglam|Iris]]) and one of the Elite Four Members, Renbu, are [[niggers]]. These niggers were added to the Pokemon games possibly because niggers bawwwed and complained to Nintendo that it was racist that There are no black people on the Internet. Plus, [[DO NOT WANT|new Pokemon]] are introduced, like some [[Zoroark|dark type anthro-weasel-fox thing]] for [[sick fuck]]s to pair with [[Lucario]] and Weavile in their twisted, horrendous sex art. [[Sarcasm|Thanks ''so'' much]], Japan. And thanks for [[OM NOM NOM]]ing on the bullshit before the [[Jewnited States of Americunts|West]].

===Other [[Bullshit]] Games===
Never let it be said Pokémon games were ''entirely'' without variety. The franchise spawned a sizable menagerie of miscellaneous bullshit, mostly games with some generic engine and a Pokémon veneer with which to fag up your DS or [[Nintendo|N64]]. As a result, most of these are horrible and should never be played, EVAR.


*'''Pokémon [[Camwhore|Snap]]''' - You're a Pokémon [[porn]] photographer, and the [[power level|level]] of [[hentai|perversity]] just keeps increasing until you finally end up getting raped on the moon. There was no sequel, to the [[furfag]]s' sorrow.

*'''Pokémon [[Old media|Pinball]]''' - Pinball! With a Pokémon theme! At least you didn't have to [[RAGE|buy it twice to complete the fucking thing]].

*'''Pokémon [[Handegg|Stadium]]''' - All [[Roman Empire|gladiatorial]] [[buttsecks|battling]], no other gameplay included. Useful for getting starters, extra Eevees, and Mew for your copy of Red/Blue, though, as it could [[Hipster|hook up]] via the controller.

*'''Pokémon [[Josef Fritzl|Mystery Dungeon]]''' - A [[Guro|popular Jap genre]] with a Pokémon face. Notable for its [[Truth|comparatively intricate storylines]], gameplay [[Otherkin|as a Pokémon]] rather than as a human trainer, and its ability to have dungeons that are simultaneously never the same twice ''and'' repetitive as fuck, this game is held responsible for at least 12% of Pokémon-related suicides. The other 88% stem from the music at [http://j0nawithazero.tumblr.com/post/394333234 Lavender] [http://www.falconchurch.com/showthread.php?180-Lavender-Town-Tone%28Pokemon-Red-Green%29-THIS-IS-VERY-VERY-LONG Town] in Red/Blue.

*'''Pokémon [[Power Rangers|Ranger]]''' - A retarded showcase game for the DS's stylus/touchscreen hardware with Pokémon shit glommed onto it at the last minute. You capture Pokémon by [[Tracing|drawing circles around them]] and then can only [[Pooper|use them]] once before you have to let them go again. Truly an exercise in [[Borg|futility]].

*'''Pokémon [[Tetris|Trozei!]]''' - Lame ripoff of ''Yoshi's Cookie''. The only reason why [[You|you]] bought this is because [[Poor|you didn't have enough money]] for the [[New media|latest set of games]] and bought this piece of [[Shit|shit]] [[Typical|because it had "pokemon" on it.]]

*'''Pokémon [[Magic|Trading Card Game]]''' - So...this is a video game of a trading card game adapted from a video game...[[facepalm]].

*'''[[Super Smash Brothers]]''' - Although not Pokémon games in the strict sense, this series does include a couple of the more commonly-known [[Lucario|tiresome]] [[Pikachu|little]] [[Jigglypuff|fuckers]] as playable characters, and also has stages and [[Mario|power-up]]s Pokéfags will [[I came|readily recognize]].

==Pokémon Types And Elements==
*'''[[NORP|Normal]]:''' The "basic" non-elemental type for all Pokémon based off of animals too generic or [[boring]] to bother placing into a better category. They had very few "[[Retard|Special]]" attacks, held no advantage over anything, and were weak versus [[violence|Fighting]] attacks. They also couldn't damage [[Ghost]]-types [[shit nobody cares about|(unless you used Foresight beforehand)]], and were one of the weakest types in the game. Great job there, [[Nintendo]].

*'''[[KILL IT WITH FIRE|Fire]]:''' If you had a favorite Pokémon, chances are it was probably a Fire-type. Loved by all and feared by many, Fire types dished out ridiculous amounts of special damage, had vaguely high health and speed, and were even able to hold their own against Water types and their other various weaknesses, in case you didn't see that coming. Often the dumb bitch who chose the grass type starter lost there money after being [[Rape]]d by the fire type (there gaping assholes only teach them the power of fire!!!).

*'''[[Waterboarding|Water]]/[[Amphetamine|Ice]]:''' Based off of [[Lolrus|marine creatures]] and [[Spongebob Squarepants|sealife]], Water types were for J[[RPG]] fans who enjoyed sitting around fishing for pixels all day, rather than going out and exploring the actual game. They all looked the same and were pathetic in-game (the only exception being [[Mudkip]], of course).

*'''[[Electric Boogaloo|Electric]]:''' None of these were based off of animals that could really shoot [[electricity]] [[irl]], such as eels. [[Fleshlight|Lightning]] was for mechafags and [[WoW]] players who enjoy abusive stunning effects, and being extremely hard to hit. The only reason to capture one was for the "[[Flash]]" attack, used to light up [[anal|Dark places]]. [[lol|I swear to god, I'm out of Parlyz Heal and if that fucker.... FAAAAAACK!!]]

*'''[[Wizard Rock|Rock]]/[[Ground floor|Ground]]:''' These had shitloads of HP and stupidly high defense. Fighting one took forever, and you would often run into those bastard hikers in the caves, when your Water type was dead and all you had left was your Fire type. Ground on the other hand was a shitty mix of [[Cocaine|Rock]] and Normal, which means it performed poorly at being either of them.

*'''[[Fight Club|Fighting]]:''' These had lots of [[bodybuilder|physical strength]] but could easily get [[mindfuck]]ed by psychics and also [[O rly|birds for some reason]]. They had little use until the Dark-types came out which [[jock|they could then beat up on]].

*'''[[Psychic]]:''' Geared towards the users of /[[i/]]. These had powerful special attack and defense, but low physical defense and health. Basically every "mage" character in any RPG anywhere. Known as the [[Final Fantasy VI|Esper]] type in the Japanese version.

*'''[[Creepypasta|Ghost]]:''' Overpowered, but rare. [[hax|Completely immune to normal attacks]] and resistant to ground based moves in the later games, your only chance in hell was to train up an [[Abra]] or [[Gardevoir|something]]. There's also a move called "[[Swearing|Curse]]" that makes ghosts [[an hero]].

*'''[[Drug|Poison]]:''' Irritating long lasting poison effects made these guys a bitch to fight. These are often employed by the [[Fail|pathetic grunts]] of Team [[cock|Rocket]], and after a battle ended, the [[Zombie|infected]] Pokémon would cause your screen to have a [[seizure]] every four steps you took.

*'''[[Heavy metal|Steel]]:''' Designed to appeal to [[HARDCORE]] Pokémon fans and [[Fullmetal Alchemist|metalfags]]. Basically just the same as Rock but with even [[moar]] defense and HP.

*'''[[Emo|Dark]]:''' Because Ghost just wasn't enough for the legions of [[faggot]] [[fanfiction]] writers and [[emo]]s that make up most of the Pokémon fanbase. Easily some of the most unoriginal designs and uninspired movesets in the game, but don't you dare tell an [[Fail|Umbreon]] [[fanboy]] that.

*'''[[Weed|Grass]]/[[Bug Chasers|Bug]]:''' Slow, weak, and would burn to cinders at the smallest spark. Rather [[ironic]] seeing as Pokémon originally started out as having [[Japanese Bug Fights|just Bug types killing each other]] and nothing else. Most of these [[How do i shot web?|shot powders]] that stunned or forced you to [[Sexsomnia|sleep]].

*'''[[Bird is the word|Flying]]:''' Various [[YOU'RE A BIRD!|winged creatures]] who could [[No shit|fly]] unless they were insects or [[Batman|bats]] other than [[Space Bat|Crobat]]. They could also be served [[chikins|fried]] or [[Frosty the Snowman|frozen]].

*'''[[Dragon]]:''' Probably the only type in the game worth a damn. Overpowered and can learn virtually all the other moves. Used by whiny ass little bastards who think the world of Pokémon is real. Nearly [[epic Fail|impossible]] to kill and even [[MOAR]] impossible to level-up. Dragon's only weakness is [[Amphetamines|Ice]] and [[Self-pwn|Dragon]]. <b>PROTIP:</b> [[Killdozer|Get a modest kingdra and teach it ice beam.]] Many [[lulz]] will be made once you [[pwn]] a [[13-year old boy|13-year old boy's]] [[Shark|garchomp]] or [[Unoriginal|salamence]] because dragon moves [[Hax|didn't do shit to it despite it being a dragon.]]

*'''[[???]]:''' Only obtained through the use of [[hax]]. There is only one example of the mystery type, ???: [[Divide by 0|MissingNo]]. MissingNo [[kill]]s your save file and sends it to the [[Goatse|deepest]] pits of [[Hell]]; this glitch lures in [[retards]] by offering them [[At least 100|loads]] of Rare [[candy]]. The tards attempt this glitch and their save files turn [[derp]] [[oh noes|before exploding before their eyes]].

*'''[[Profit|Profit!]]'''

==[[DO NOT WANT|Status Conditions]]==
*[[Cripple|'''Paralysis''']] condition inflicted by 33% of Electric attacks (and 100% of Body Slams), from which you cannot recover without the use of items or Refresh/Heal Bell; and slows the sufferer down ''and'' makes 99% of their attacks not work. Causes extreme fucking rage. A favourite of faggot trainers who like to paralyse you with their shitty fucking Magnemite before you rape them with your 12-levels-higher Charizard.

*[[AIDS|'''Poison''']] an equally stupid condition wherein the poisoned Pokemon gradually loses HP ''even when you are out of battle''.

*[[Rape|'''Sleep''']] stupider still, sleep stops your Pokemon from doing ANYTHING, but it doesn't last very long, so the game mindfucks you into choosing whether to use an item or not.

*[[Sophie Delezio|'''Burn''']] see Poison, only with attack reduced instead of speed. How original!

*[[Brandon Crisp|'''Freeze''']] see Sleep, but it never lasts more than one turn and most Fire moves can still be used while frozen. Pure fail.

*[[Slut|'''Attract''']] [[RAGE|FUCK YOU WHITNEY AND YOUR FUCKING MILTANK WHY COULDN'T MY STARTER POKEMON BE A GIRL FUCKING CUNT BITCH]]

*[[Transexuals|'''Confusion''']][[RAGE|FUCK YOU TENTACOOL AND ZUBAT!!! YOUR ASSHOLES WILL BE MINE WHEN I FIND A WAY TO ENTER POKERMON GOLD AND SILVER AND RED AND BLUE!!! STOP APPEARING WHEN I GO INTO CAVES AND OCEANS YOU BITCHES RUINED A 7 YEAR OLDS GAMING EXPERIANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]]

*[[Wicca|'''Curse''']] condition inflicted by Ghost types wherein your Pokemon's HP goes down by about 20% every turn. [[Sarcasm|A totally fair move that should not be removed at all]].

==The Anime==

[[Image:TeamRocketMassiveHeadBattle.png|thumb|[[LOL WUT|Many episodes were based around Meowth's experimentation with hallucinogens.]]]]
[[Image:Pokeboys.jpg|thumb|The anime has many loyal fans.]]
[[Image:Digglet_underground.JPG|thumb|right|What Diglett looks like in the new live action movie!]]

The Pokémon cartoon tells the story of [[hermaphroditic]] Ash Ketch[[cum]], whose hollow life is devoted entirely to Pokémon [[fanboy]]ism. Therefore, he teams up with his best buddy and [[life partner|partner]], the electrified [[hamster|rat]] [[Pikachu]], and sets out to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|catch 'em all]].

Ash is soon accompanied by Misty O'IttyBittyTitties, former [[16-year-old girl|underage]] [[fetish]] model. He is also joined by [[Brock]] Statue Tory, all around [[pervert|horn dog]] and charter member of the [[cunt|Nurse Joy]] appreciation club. A running joke involves Brock [[cum]]ming in his pants whenever he sees anything with [[tits|breasts]], which happens with [[Over 9000|amazing frequency]] considering his [[Azn|eyes are permanently closed]]. However, the reason behind Brock's weird-ass behavior is his [[homosexuality]]. This is the only explanation why he has never had a [[girlfriend]], and why he loves to [[Cock|cook]]. As the rest of the gang are major [[homophobic|gay-bashers]], he hides this with his [[Not gay|girl "obsession."]] 

Ash is chased around the world by Team Rocket members [[lesbian|Jessie]], [[homo|James]], and their annoying retarded [[cat]]. They supply [[At least 100|95]]% of this show's [[lulz]] in the form of [[fail|endless]] attempts to steal Pikachu so that their boss would [[GG|appreciate them]] again, not that he did anyway. They are also the subject of many [[flame wars|shipping wars]] among Poké[[fans]] who are just too [[dumb]] to realize James is [[gay]].

Misty later leaves the show after getting [[pregnant|knocked up]] and is promptly replaced by May, a [[jailbait]] [[whore]] with breasts that more than make up for Misty's lack thereof. May brings along her brother Max, an [[incest]]uous [[Shotacon|little]] [[fuckface]], who seems to [[Mega ultra super genius|know more about Pokémon than Ash]]. In order to boost ratings, Dawn is then introduced to the show, and considering that she's 10 years old, she is an even bigger [[whore]] than the other girls, (if possible), mainly due to her [[pantyshot|extremely short skirt]]. Having the [[Lolicon|smallest chest]], she is clearly [[fanservice]] for [[pedophile]]s, [[amirite]]?

[[Some argue]] the entire series is merely Ash's coma-induced [[dream]], revealing such elements of his subconscious as his [[Freud|repressed sexual feelings]] and [[bastard|poor relationship with his father]], which is most likely true if he runs away from home to serch for da weird tings known as Pokemans. [[E-Psychiatrist|These people]] need to find [[Masturbation|something better to do]] than [[Animu archetypes|psychoanalyzing]] [[Redundant|bad anime]].

===Coma Induced Dream===
<big>'''Warning: [[TL;DR]] ahead!'''</big>

<div style="height:225px; overflow:scroll; border: 5px solid white; padding: 3px; background: white; vertical-align: top; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; margin-bottom: 3px;">

Did one ever know the reason why the pacing and story development changed after Ash was hit by lightning in the beginning episodes? How Ash and his world were relatively normal until after the incident? I have a theory. The accident with the bike put Ash in a coma. Days later he was found and was hurried to the hospital and treated with heavy medications. This is why Team Rocket became less menacing. The medication took effect and stabilized his coma dreams; instead of being terrifying, they became idyllic, and he's able to live out his Pokémon master fantasies.

If one had noticed, the early episodes of Pokémon were of amazing quality. The rest of the series is just the results of his subconscious mind fulfilling his desires, as well as attempting to escape them. Should Ash realize he's in a coma, he would wake up, but suffer brain damage. So he has to take down all his mental barriers one by one until he can come to grips with what he is and escape his coma.

This explains why he doesn't change much physically. Also, the worldwide socialism can be explained if you once again realize that this is a dream world; he thought up a safe system of government that would run smoothly and keeps the world going allowing his adventures to work like they do. It also explains a few other things, such as how a child can go off on his own in a world full of dangerous untamed animals, and why every Pokémon Center has the same exact nurse. Joy and Jenny he knew from his hometown, and they act as a safety net or anchor, allowing him to feel safe no matter where he goes. The professors, like the Joys and Jennys, represent stability, and Ash's ideals. This is why Gary became a professor. It's also the reason that every time he enters a new region, virtually no one has heard of him, despite his conquests, and why Giovanni leads Team Rocket. How could Paul, the rival of the Sinnoh area, not know of someone who has placed in at least the top 16 of all three Leagues and has destroyed the Orange League and Battle Frontier?

Ash’s traveling partners are actually aspects of himself he can enjoy, but doesn't like to associate with himself. Team Rocket are his qualities that he deems "negative," but is coming to terms with. Jessie and James want to appease Giovanni, Ash's father. Meowth especially wants to appease him because he remembers the good times with Giovanni. This places Meowth in a category known as Ash's (corrupted) innocence, and another fragment of Ash's humanity. If you note that Meowth can speak, this quickly becomes apparent. In fact the whole reason for Meowth's speech is so he can help Ash accept Team Rocket as part of himself eventually.

Brock is Ash's repressed sexuality. He fell into the coma a virgin and needed an outlet for his growing sexual frustrations. Since he can never experience sex, Brock must never succeed. Brock is a projection of his sexuality, and is constantly shot down because Ash could never “know” sex. Brock isn't just Ash's latent sexuality, he's also his fatherly instincts, neither of which Ash can come to terms with. Brock leaves his siblings to "journey" with Ash, because Ash can't cope with having that much responsibility, much as his foray with a real relationship ends on mysterious terms. Ash just cannot handle commitment at his mental level. Brock's stay with professor Ivy was an attempt to outright suppress his sexuality. You'll notice that James got much more dialogue in this part of the series, as well as getting more touchy feely with his Pokémon and getting most of his backstory. Ash didn't enjoy this much, hence the reasons Brock comes back all horrified, and refuses to speak about it. (Ash's subconscious was repressing him at the time, so other than a general feeling of dread he has no idea of what went on then.) This is also why Brock keeps coming back to the series... Usually AFTER Ash meets a new girl aspect of himself. Misty is an image that Ash had of a girl. This is why she plays so prevalently in the series but is ultimately unattainable because he never really knew her before the coma. Likely the one that helped get him to a hospital. I have a theory in line with this: since Misty was his initial love interest (if only subconsciously), he needed her to reach a level of womanhood. He felt that people could only have relationships when they've matured. But in practice, it turned out he couldn't cope with it and just wanted the normal, pushy, arrogant Misty he knew, and wouldn't let her keep Togepi anymore.

Misty is Ash's first attempt at a girl he could love, however, being a girl from the real world, all he really he knew of her was her anger, as a result she ended up quite hot-headed in his mind. Constantly berating his sexuality, but eventually mellowing out until she had faded into the background. This was also traumatizing to him, being attached to it. Since then, the thought of anyone around him maturing to adulthood has been blocked, and anyone who shows signs of it will quickly end up leaving for another, more naïve fill-in.

Max came with May, she played the Id with great aspirations, and he played the sensible Ego that "session." They worked for a little while, but Ash, being a teenager; eventually his sexuality had to come back into play. He kept reinventing himself and eventually wrote new aspects, but his mind slowly brought back the old ones as a crutch to make the transition easier.

Dawn is Ash giving himself a chance to love. since he already established Misty as someone he's not likely to go anywhere with, he created a new super female, one that was more like him, and less violent all the time. (One will note that both May and Misty had no tolerance for Brock whatsoever whereas Dawn seems to try and shrug it off).

Tracey, the Breeder, was a possible future for Ash that he discarded. It was one that he sent off to work with the Professor (the professors being Ash's ultimate ideal of a father figure) when he disrupted the dynamic Ash had with his other possibilities. Ash's mind is fighting the coma and since Ash viewed this one as a companion he was quickly replaced with a more threatening rival.

Pikachu obviously represents Ash's humanity, hence the episodes where they get separated, and Ash wants desperately to find him, even to the point of working with the Rockets (aspects of himself he would never normally associate with) but for some reason cannot. They want to steal Pikachu (Ash’s humanity) and hand it over to his father, Giovanni. Jessie and James will always oppose Ash because Ash is terrified of the thought of his humanity lying in the hands of his father. However this is the same reason that he will work with those aspects of himself in order to save his humanity from just becoming flat out LOST. He couldn't evolve his Pikachu without challenging his concept of who he was, something he wasn't comfortable with while he was still working through his original issues.

Another thing is the narrator. The narrator is Ash's higher mind, recapping and explaining the progress he's made and the tribulations he will face allowing itself insight into how best to awaken him.

Ash has issues with his father; so he put him atop the evil corporation, and demonized him. There may be an actual Team Rocket, and I'm positive they're quite dastardly, but I doubt that Ash's father is their leader, in fact the head of the Rockets wasn't really identified as anyone until later on in the series. The split between Ash's parents was likely over Ash's homosexuality and some sort of incident as a catalyst, forcing his father to disown him and his mother to move out of the city and down to Pallet Town. This is why Giovanni runs the faceless vile corporation, and why he berates Jessie, James, and Meowth as much as he does, and why they keep trying to please him. Another thing to notice is the difference in uniform, the Rockets wear black and red, where Team Rocket wears white... a symbol of their purity and naïveté. They're willing to please Father despite his utter hatred of those parts of Ash.

Team Rocket are aspects of Ash's personality that he has deemed "bad." James implied homosexuality, and Jessie is vanity. You'll remember that Meowth has the potential for rehabilitation, and doesn't want to be evil, so yet again this fits in with the conflicting personalities and demonized self theory. Team Rocket started cross-dressing because Ash had to come to terms with that part of himself. It was something he was able to allow his gay/vain side to experiment with (and by virtue of that himself). When he found that it wasn't something for him, his "free" side stopped playing with it. Further, their methods of capture become more and more ludicrous (and physically impossible) because Ash is just a kid dreaming these things up. This is the reason Team Rocket's disguises are always believed. He knows it's them (on some level), but chooses to ignore it, so he can better himself, in a sense the Ash who wants to escape is sabotaging the Ash who wants to stay lost in his mind. So that there can be more conflict, and hopefully an eventual escape. The filler episodes that don't focus on Ash and the gang are his mind working through, and humanizing the parts of himself that he demonized. It's a way for him to deal with issues that Ash and crew wouldn't touch, because it involves treading ground he himself had sworn not to go near. As I said, Team Rocket and the episodes they occupy are Ash dealing with ground he feels uncomfortable with tackling on his own. Jessie is Ash's vanity and gullibility, she will trick Ash's submissive homosexuality into doing her bidding so she can please Father. James' troubled childhood is his way of justifying his latent homosexuality. Now James is Ash's latent homosexuality, hence why he is constantly punished by Pokémon and attacked by random attractive girls. I believe the split between Ash's parents was caused by this part of Ash, maybe an incident at school, bringing shame on the family and forcing them to move to the small, country town of Pallet. Ash's motivations for his journey were to escape mounting pressure at home.

So in a way, Ash IS Team Rocket. The rest of the whole organization including Butch and Cassidy is symbolic of his inability to escape his father's machinations.

Mr. Mime is actually a stand in for Ash's father, one that can't emotionally abuse him or his mom. He is a Pokémon, a peace-loving creature that's oddly humanoid, but that can never hurt a human. Ash's was never really hurt by a Pokémon, so he sees them all as harmless; whereas, in the real world they may be quite feral or vicious (as seen in the early episodes). Again falling back to the theory that the only real Pokémon are the ones from the first season, and everything else is just further speculation coming from his mind on what new species would look like.

The new teams (Magma, Aqua, and Galactic) are Ash attempting to work out the problems he has with his father. To do that he first needs a new "bad guy" to feel good about beating, and if Giovanni isn't leading a criminal organization he can more easily relate to him.

If one recalls, there were real animals early in the show and references to animals in the game and show. For example, a clear case to point out is the aquarium of fish in the Cerulean City Gym or that according to the Pokédex, Pikachu is a "rat-like" Pokémon. But they don't matter to Ash's psyche so they don't come into play much. If Ash had loved puppies, everything would be about different breeds of dogs, and a dog fighting circuit. But, as the series goes on longer, we've been seeing less realistic animals and more Pokémon. This could be a sign of Ash’s mind deteriorating. As he's in this coma, he's losing concepts of some animals and machinery and replacing them with Pokémon. It could explain things like electric Pokémon working as power generators. A sign that his memory of the old world is slipping more and more as time goes by. The Pokémon realm will be idealized continuously the longer he has no stimulus from the real world. He may or may not be mentally deteriorating , but he is becoming more accustomed to his fake world's rules. The wild Pokémon are his rationalizations of the functioning of the world. It’s the "A wizard did it" syndrome. If he doesn't know how it works, his mind says Pokémon. He justifies anything he can't explain with Pokémon, and real animals fall into the background because he has no real interest in them.

The Pokémon in Ash's team are his issues, for example Charmander represents his sex drive (not his sexuality like Brock); at first it's a cute, easy-to-control thing, but eventually it becomes a raging inferno of disobedience. Acquiring his team means getting at his issues, but as he trains them, he works said issues out. Other trainers are more direct forms of his issues, ones that he must either come to terms with or outright suppress. Gym leaders are more primary aspects of his personality with each Pokémon being stronger than the last, to display a level of skill he could be capable of if only he gave into it. In effect, he is doing battle with a part of him that he would rather not have in control. Bulbasaur was Ash's unwillingness to change, this is reflected when it declines to evolve and how it almost decided to stay behind unless he battled it. Squirtle was his willingness to follow the lead of others, as evidenced by the gang it ran with, even though he ran the gang, they were viewed as one group, and Ash's subconscious just gave him the strongest one. Butterfree was his crushing loneliness, which he dealt with when he released it to join a flock. His bird types are his recklessness, always willing to sacrifice something at a moment's notice for the win. When Ash is trading Pokémon, it's an attempt to push his own problems away on someone else; however, he realizes this and usually trades back fairly quickly. Originally Ash had the battles, which evolved into team battles and contests. The explanation for this is that his issues became more and more complicated, and the means of dealing with them needed to become more complex. The fact that he uses issues that he has already dominated to win - these are signs that he's growing stronger.

Not only are Ash’s Pokémon a manifestation of different parts of himself, so are Pokémon of other trainers as well. Koffing and Ekans were symbolic of Team Rocket's willingness to change; hence, their evolutions. Once his mind beat that roadblock down and allowed them to change once, it gives him the chance to truly change. Pupitar is a rationalization, a Pokémon that a rival caught before he met him. Even Ash would become suspicious if everyone he met had no carry-over from previous places he had been to.

Ash releases his Pokémon because his mind is forcing him to let go of them. The second he raises an overpowered team, a tournament comes up, and after fighting his way through it he has to go to a new land for new challenges, but with an overpowered team, there won't be any challenges, and no way to motivate him further, part of Ash wants to stay in the coma, and keep journeying.

Ash's traveling also never really nets him any fame, no matter what he does, or where he goes, and the answer for that is simple. Ash just can't picture himself as famous, so he essentially adopts a new identity every few months.

The reason he never truly becomes a master is because that would mean he'd have nothing left to dream, and would wake up from his coma. Ash’s dual personality is one that wants to maintain his fantasy world and slowly sort his thoughts out carefully. The other part wants freedom, and to return to his real life, to finally become a real Pokémon master. However if he's allowed to keep his powerful team there's no reason to meet and tame new Pokémon (issues), he'll lose interest, and the chance of becoming self-aware comes around again. So it's not that he gives them up, it's that he loses them, and unless he's desperate (such as with Charizard) he can't get them back. It’s basically his mind forcing him to deal with his issues. It would also be a good reason why Paul has shown up at this point, and Ash has been forced to work with him on at least one occasion: it's his mind's last ditch efforts to snap him out of this, to force Ash to actually come to terms that this perfect world is not the best option and he needs to wake up. Paul is Ash's dark side, one that wants to push on even harder and harder, and the part of him that will stop at nothing to escape this coma world.

Ash’s rivals and the Elite Four are ultimately the strongest part of this cycle. Having Pokémon that are essentially godlike, they represent both what can be attained and what is unattainable. Gary Oak is what Ash wants to be. He is wish fulfillment. He succeeded, and settled down to a normal life. Ash needs someone to succeed in his world or he won't be able to validate it and will start questioning why he's where he is. It’s a subconscious trap to keep him from becoming too aware of his situation. His mind must have figured out that awareness of the coma would snap him out of it, but it would cause major brain damage, so it took something the boy already loved and built a way out for him with it. However, Ash is too complacent to finally fight his way out of it, and cannot escape. This is why he keeps encountering Legendary Pokémon; they're his mind's way of showing him he can do great things if he tries, and it's a way to encourage him to push forwards. The Legendary Pokémon are Ash's mind telling him that he has greatness in him and thus, can escape his happy–go–lucky reality.

Ash's rivals are all possible futures he envisions for himself (note that they are all older than him). This originated with Gary Oak, someone Ash knew from real life, and built up into a sort of god within his mind. Gary, however, progressed and changed to suit Ash's vision of himself and ultimate desire, eventually settling down into a professor after beating the Elite Four. With Gary in retirement his mind needed a new rival for him, thus the births of Richie (the good aspect of his rivalry) and Paul (as the darker aspect, a cut-throat Ash, willing to do anything to escape the coma world).

Richie and his Pikachu were another success story for Ash, but he wanted one he could be closer with. One nearly identical to him. One that even used a similar roster to him. Paul and his Chimchar are the polar opposite of Richie, Paul wants nothing to do with any kind of weakness, and is almost aware of his situation. He's always pushing for something more.

The reason he discarded his original hat and the elements of Japanese culture so prevalent in the first season is simple. He wanted to travel and broaden his horizons; every time he reinvented himself to do so, he lost touch with his original self. If he ever does escape the coma he'll likely have achieved a sort of Zen state. Considering the amount of personal issues he deals with inside his head, it's entirely likely that he was the next Buddha of the Pokémon world, and that the lightning strike and subsequent coma are a way for him to realize his true self, and destiny.

Mewtwo was a new form of treatment, done with electric impulses and a machine to knock Ash out of it, taking down every last one of his mental guards (the original Pokémon in the movie). In Ash's mind, Mewtwo and his clones were the treatment for the mental safe guards that were protecting Ash and keeping him comatose; the Pokémon of his world. The clones were counters to Ash's mental safeties, and so each appeared to Ash as the exact copy of his defense, intended to take it down by force. The clones didn't play by the rules of Ash's world, they didn't use any special Pokémon attacks or moves – they just beat down their counterpart by brute strength. The treatment was working, but there were side effects. The electric jolts were beginning to affect Ash's nervous system, and if the treatment continued, he would be paralyzed. His mind realized this and manifested it to Ash by petrifying him in his dream. Were it not for the end of the treatment by Ash's mother (knowing her son would never want to live in a world he couldn’t explore) Ash would have remained as stone in his dream. After this, Ash needed to recover from the damage of the electric therapy. Obviously it was greatly dangerous to him, and in order to reduce the danger Ash's consciousness felt from it, Ash's subconscious began downplaying the effects of electricity in Ash's world, which is why Pikachu’s electric attacks - once noted for their strength by Team Rocket – no longer have any effect on Ash, other than comic relief.

Even the world Ash lives in evidences this. The sprawling forests and eco-friendly cities are all his childish innocence. He never travels on a bike despite the distance due to the accident having given him a phobia of them.

As one could see, it is very likely that Ash is trapped in his world. But like every dream, everything, there is a beginning and an end. What would happen if Ash could fully recover? What would happen if he never does? There are infinite branches of possibilities that spiral upwards and intertwine towards the top at a single point, both in his “world” and the real world. In his hospital room, we see Delia, obviously distraught talking to a doctor with a grim look in his eye. He's saying that their insurance is up, and the boy has had no change in brain activity for seven years. That a shock like this may awaken him. She tearfully agrees.

Professor Oak is there to comfort her as they take Ash off life-support.

In Ash’s “world”...

Ash has finally defeated the Elite Four, and one by one the people around him start disappearing. Eventually everything is black. Pikachu comes dashing towards him glowing brighter and brighter in the darkness. Eventually Pikachu reaches Ash and the two embrace one last time.

Back in his room, as his life signs fade, Ash mutters his genuine, final words.

I... Want... To... Be...

The... Very... Best.

The image of his gaunt, tube-fed, ten-some-year bedridden body on the bed. His head appears bulbous from atrophy. As he utters his last words, he barely opens his eyes, seeing a silhouette of the figure at the center of his turbulent emotions, his mother, her face obstructed by her hands wiping away tears. He makes contact with her eyes and lets out one last tear before losing all strength. She breaks down in hysterics.

The worst part of all this is that Ash will die, never having experienced actual love; imagine if you will, having lived in a world like his, completely shut off from all things but yourself, and your perception of yourself, with nothing to do but better yourself. No other people to interact with, and issues to solve with no guiding hand.

The boy will die, never having known his dream, except as naught but a dream. The second he gets out into reality for that last moment, part of him knows it was all a lie... his faithful Pikachu? His friends? All his imagination, and maybe, he could have fought and clung to life, maybe even made a full recovery. But knowing that his efforts and ambitions had all been for naught, he just gave up and let the motion carry him away, just so he could be with Pikachu, in a place where his friends were waiting.

I would like to think that he'll realize that his mother loved him and was holding out hope that he'd recover all that time. On the flip side, though, when he sees her he knows that the hope she had is totally broken and she'd come to the crushing realization that the worst thing that can befall a parent has happened to her: outliving her only child. At once he knows he is loved and that it means that the one closest to him is utterly crushed.

Still, there are other possibilities. The fountain of time flows in mysterious ways. One could not go back, against the current such as Gatsby; but, one could never see what is waiting for him downstream. Ash finally defeats Lance, only to be confronted by not Gary Oak, but a mute, mirror image of himself.

The voice of the narrator speaks to him, telling him that now he can finally escape the prison of his own mind. One by one, his friends appear and melt away into more copies of him, all cheering him on. After a long tough battle against himself with the assistance of all of his Pokémon he had ever befriended, he jolts awake.

In his hospital room he sees his parents asleep; he finds himself unable to speak.

Ash pushes forward towards his recovery. Going through physical therapy, training harder and harder with rehabilitative Pokémon, until he can walk on his own again. This time, an older and wiser Ash sets out on a journey. Just like last time, he's late getting to Professor Oak's laboratory. And when there's only one Pokémon left... He suddenly recalls all his memories of his "life" and realizes that all his friends are gone forever.

As he sets out with his new companion, he finds the world is darker than he imagined. More "real;" Pokémon and people die; he too has aged.

He vows to become the Master he dreamed he was. He vows to himself.

He vows to "them."

I WILL be the very best!

==Fansites==

[[Image:Ultimatepokemonfanfictionsite.jpg|thumb|Typical Pokémon fansite.]]

[[At least 100 years ago|Back in the day]], everyone and their [[grandmother]] created an [[gif|animated-gif-filled]] Pokémon fansite on [[Geoshities]], named using a complex algorithm to find the perfect combination of the words "[[BDSM|Master]]," "[[Unwarranted self-importance|Ultimate]]," "[[Legendary ruin status|Legendary]]," and an [[Mudkip|arbitrarily chosen Pokémon mascot]].  These fansites come complete with instructions on how to get [[Longcat|Mew]] and Pika[[Blu Aardvark|blu]] in the games, [[Zelda|Pokémon/Zelda]] [[crossover]] fanfiction, and in-depth discussions on Ashx[[Lugia]] shipping ([[OTP]]!!!).

The internet currently holds the undeleted remnants of these fansites, the Pokémon [[wiki]] [[Bulbapedia]], and multiple [[copypasta]] versions of [[wapanese|serebii.net]]. PokéFags also seem to think people are interested in watching [[tl;dw|10-minute-long YouTube videos]] of them messing around with their Pokémon games and a [[GSCentral|GameShark]].

[[FanFiction.Net]] is notorious for [[slash]]fics, to the point that no one is surprised when [[Sephiroth]] is paired with [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Rule 34|they have sex in a locker room]]. Pokémon [[fanfiction]]s, however, take slashfics to a whole new level of depravity and horror. A prime example of this is the fanfiction "Diamond Pokemon" (the author's originality is expressed in this title, f'sho). Through painstaking research (liberal amounts of eyebleach were needed afterwards), it has been deduced that the fic is basically about Dawn fucking everything that moves, including her mom, a bidoof, a guy with two dicks and even a Geodude. The creator of all this [[Sick fuck|sickfuck]]ery? megadeth425, who basically wrote 55,000 pages of underage fucking and bestiality. An example of megadeth's prime writing:

"Dawn had been in some strange positions before. In terms of gym badges, she had won two of them with sex, and a third required sex before she could actually battle the leader. Still, except for Maylene, none had come even close in intensity to being mounted doggy style by a very horny Bastiodon. "Fuck me!" she screamed, her face covered by a white mask of semen, as the girthy steel Pokemon ravished her. Her clothes, likewise, had been splattered with jizz, her top cut down the middle by an eager Skorupi, exposing her small breasts, which were, you guessed it, coated in cum."

===[[Shipping]] Wars===

----

[[Image:Ashbeengayfrompokemon.jpg|thumb|Ash playing with Gary's PokéBalls.]]
[[Image:Pokemonhentai41.jpg|thumb|Misty left the show shortly afterward.]]
As Pokémon forums emerged, [[16-year-old girls]] could post threads asking "OMGZ! U THINK ASH AND MISTY LEIK EACH OTHER?" Fair enough question, except Ash is a [[retard]] and has the emotional threshold of a [[brick]]. They called the ship "Pokéshipping" or, for the [[Wapanese]], "SatoKasu." But then, the [[yaoi]] [[fangirls]] came out and [[Bitch|INSISTED]] Ash and his rival, [[Gary Oak]], wanted sekrit [[buttsex]] with each other. They called it "[[Packer|Palletshipping]]" because they were both rivals from Pallet Town. And then the Palletshippers and Pokéshippers [[flame]]d each other.

Then some other people went "[[NO U|NO WAI]]! Brock and Misty are in love! It's called Gymshipping cuz they're both gym leaders!" And so the Gymshippers flamed the Pokéshippers. And then different yaoi fangirls went "Nuh-uh, girlfriend! Ash and Brock are soooo fux0ring!" They called themselves Bouldershippers. And they flamed the Pokéshippers and Palletshippers.

AND THEN, Brock left the show for a while and was replaced by that [[art fag]], [[Dick|Tracey]]. And the Gymshippers and Bouldershippers went "[[OMG]][[WTF]]?" But then some other shippers showed up and paired Misty with Tracey, and called themselves [[The Annoying Orange|Orangeshippers]] because it was the [[Orange]] Island saga. They flamed the Gymshippers and the Pokéshippers. And there was also people who shipped Ash and Tracey but [[noone]] remembers what they were called and [[nobody gives a shit]].

Eventually Brock came back, and Tracey was left with his [[hero]] Professor Oak (who is also shipped, but no one really argues over that since it's non-[[canon]]), and the shipping wars came back to normal for the entirety of the over-padded Johto Journeys. 

Then, the bomb hit.
"MISTY'S LEAVING [[OMG]][[WTF]]?!!" 

That was the reaction when the girl for Advanced Generation, Haruka (later called May by the [[4Kids]] [[fascists]]), was introduced. Pokéshippers tried to convince themselves that it was [[Original character|still Misty]], with different hair and clothes (and bigger [[tits]]), but it wasn't. So then they told themselves "[[ALL CAPS|OMG, I BET MISTY AND ASH WILL CONFESS THEIR LUUUV AND KISS! AND ASH IS WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES NEXT SEASON BECAUSE SHE GAVE THEM TO HIM]][[Oneoneone|!!!111]]" However, this was [[not]] to be. So the Pokéshippers locked themselves in [[Basement|their rooms]] in [[defeat]], repeating "[[Lord of the Rings|They's in love, they's in love, they's in love my preciousssssssss...]]" Somehow, a similar fallout happened with Gymshippers.

Of course, teh [[internets]] continued to bitch. Several fansites such as [http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?s=eea0f818c4dbb39127782d49019e5dd5&t=6434| this one] have pleaded for the return of Misty. Some go so far as to make shit quality videos [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltgfXKFdkh8 with shitty music], such as one made by this faggot named [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0OowSxgEcE "Pokeria1"] (who was later revealed to be [http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/User:Weedle_McHairybug a retarded momma's boy].) Obviously, none of this worked.

So, May came on the show, with her [[XBox|overdeveloped]] [[b8]] tits and [[ass]], and Ash, being [[Fucktard|dumber than a brick]], didn't notice. Despite that, people still paired them, called the Advanceshippers (or "SatoHaru").  The distressed-but-determined Pokéshippers weren't going to give up yet, so then came a second wave of flamewars between the Advanceshippers and the Pokéshippers (by then, everyone forgot about Gary). These wars also incorporated Contestshipping (May/Drew, who is the kid with the awful green hair) Brock/May shipping (which doesn't have a name, but it makes the most sense since she uses him as a [[sugar daddy]] a lot), and even the [[incest]]uous pairing of May with her [[nerd]] brother, Max.

At the end of Advanced generation, nothing happened between Ash and May, but May ended up stalking Drew to another place, so Contestshipping was declared [[canon]].

The new season is Pokémon D/P (short for Double Penetration), and the new girl is Hikari...er, Dawn ([[Sarcasm|nice name, Pokémon USA]]).  Simply because she exists in the show, she and Ash are shipped by Pearlshippers, or Diamondshippers (Wapanese use SatoHika). There is also Ikarishipping, pairing Dawn and Shinji ([[Paul]] in the [[Engrish]]) just so he can be paired with somebody, and -- oh, fuck it, you know what's going to happen. Flamewars all over the place.

You think after all that [[TL;DR]], we'd be done. No, that was just the twerp ships, the very tip of the iceberg.
[[Image:Sausage 2.jpg|thumb|right|Pick a side: They're in tr00 luv OR He's a [[fag]], she's a [[whore]], and they don't care about each other. Now, [[Mortal Kombat|FIGHT!]]]]
The stars of the show, [[Awesome|Team Rocket]], have been the center of the most brutal ongoing flamewar outside of the [[Harry Potter]] fandom, and both sides have ended up looking like [[fucktards]]. Jessie and James, through the sheer fact that they are always together (and hugging when they're scared), must be in [[love]]. Nevermind James acts like a total [[faggot]] (although the [[Wapanese]] fans swear this is only because the fascists at 4kids hired that faggot, Eric Stuart, to voice him, yet that doesn't explain his rampant [[crossdressing]]) and Jessie acts like a total whore. BUT THEYS HOLDIN HANDZ IN THA BALLOON! AND THEY GOT MARRIED IN THE MANGA! AND.. UM... JAMES ''HASN'T'' SET JESSIE ON FIRE AND PISSED ON HER SHOUTING "I HATE WIMMINZ@@!" SO IT MUST BE LUV! Such is the logic of the Rocketshippers, who might just be forgiven if they kept it to their forums and websites and not infect everywhere with their OOC fanfiction.

On the opposite side are a different sort of extremists, the Anti-Rocketshippers. Their rallying place is "satire" site [http://www.pokemopolis.net/ Pokémopolis], run by two [[New Zealand|sheep fucking kiwis]], Tim and Lex, two extremely pathetic man/women (who am I kidding?) Manchildren, who hate Japan and worship 4Kids. Despite claiming to be satire, their Anti-Rocketshipping stance is [[serious business]]. James IS A FAG! AND IT'S FUNNY! HE TOTALLY CAN'T STAND JESSIE! BUT TIM CAN! TIM LOVES JESSIE EVEN THOUGH HE CALLS HER A WHORE! OMGZ, ROCKETSHIPPERS ARE TERRORISTS! LOL! WE'RE KIDDING! BUT WE STILL HATE YOU! Such is the passive-aggressive hypocrisy of Tim and Lex. In reality, Dodgemaster Tim is a self-hating homosexual who wants to fuck James, but he covers it up by lusting after Jessie in a misogynist manner. And Lex is just a bitch.

[[Cynthia]], everyone's favorite [[Columbine|member of the Trenchcoat Mafia]], has also been paired up with a variety of people.

[[Image:Pokemon Croconaw Exploitable.png|thumb|right|[[I'm 12 years old and what is this?]]]]
[[Image:1279560740427.jpg|thumb|Pokémon IRL]]

Ash/Gary - Gary pwns Ash all the time because inside he truly cares about him which is why he dumped his cheerleading team so he could focus all on him in the Johto League! TRUE LOVE RIGHT THERE!

Cynthia/Cyrus - If you don't know who [[Cyrus]] is, he's a [[Cthulhu]] cultist who's [[disorder|at least in his late 50s and thinks he's 23]], and tries to take control of legendary Pokémon and buttfuck everybody on Earth. You also fight him [[over 9000]] times in [[Platinum]]. Even though it will never happen and is your perfect example of how shippers pair up mortal enemies (they're hiding their "twoo wuv," or some shit like that) like complete retards, they claim that one [[marriage|cursing the other's name and wishing s/he was dead]] is love. As we know, this is [[Bullshit|true]].

Cynthia/Ash - People began seeing Cynthia for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kay_Letourneau pedophile that she is] and paired her up with Ash. Not much to say other than she's a pedo. Most art for these two features Ash getting the shit squeezed out of him by Cynthia's non-existent melons.

Cynthia/Lucas - Or is it Diamond? Or Jo - it's the kid with the flaming faggot hat from [[Gangbang|D/P]] (lol). Anyway, see Ash, or replace Ash with this kid's [[George Lucas|name]].

Cynthia/Paul - See Ash, replace Ash with [[Paul]].

Cynthia/Flint - HEY GUYS, TWO PEOPLE BEING IN THE SAME ORGANISATION MEANS THEY LOVE EACH OTHER, RITE?!?!?!?!?!

[[Bestiality|Human/Pokémon]] - Popular with [[sick fucks|certain people]].

As usual... okay, you know where this is going. TL;DR Flame wars and lots of lulz.

You think we're done here? Oh no kiddies, there's plenty moar [[orgies]] where that came. There's still the entire Pokémon [[manga]] to go over. Basically, take every pairing and replace their name with a fucking [[colorbar|color]]. So technically it's all [[canon]] since [[truth|RedxBlue produces purple]]. There is no need to bore [[you]] with what is already [[common knowledge]] in most anime. To summarize: flame wars, [[lulz]], and [[blah|blah blah blah]].

===4Kids and USA Drama===
The Pokémon anime was originally dubbed for U.S. distribution by [[4Kids]]. Several episodes were [[banhammer]]ed by 4Kids for reasons varying from Brock sneezing during the [[SARS]] epidemic, to an overabundance of [[evil]] [[Japan|Japanese culture]], to James showing off his [[shemale|new boobs]], to [[Porygon]]-induced [[subliminal messages]] that would cause [[seizure]]s and the buying of more Pokémon [[crap|merchandise]]. This topic can cause [[fanboys]] to rant for hours on their fansites or online journals.

Eventually, Pokémon USA stepped in and yoinked the anime away from 4Kids. All the "fans" who had previously bitched about how 4Kids was [[sodomizing]] the series now acted like it was the [[apocalypse]] that the voice artists had been replaced. They set up [[at least 100]] online petitions to reinstate the old voices. Pokémon is clearly [[serious business]]. To make the lulz even better, one of their voice actors, Eric Stuart (who [[secks|did]] James and Brock) posted about the voice actor changeover on his website, whining like a [[13-year-old boy]] and spamming his own guestbook out of [[angst]].

==Card Game==
[[File:Nazi_Pokemon.jpg|thumb|Actual Pokémon card; Golbat is a proud [[Stormfront|white nationalist]].]]
[[Last Thursday|In 1996]], [[Dungeons and Dragons|Wizards Of The Coast]] released a trading card game in which they (badly) translated the cards from [[Japan]]. The cardgame involved the [[Strategy Guide|strategy]] of flipping [[over 9000]] coins and using [[Yu-Gi-Oh|the same set of cards for every single deck]].

Later, [[Nintendo]] realized they didn't have to rely on Wizards' shitty rules and broke up with their homoerotic corporate lovers, [[freedom|releasing them independently]] (by which time Pokémon had lost popularity anyway and was reserved for <s>ghetto kids</s> middle class [[white]] kids, whose parents couldn't afford cable or [[pedophiles|piano teachers]]). This [[Old|new]] game featured the [[copypasta|same basic principles]]: [[Two-Face|coin-flipping]], [[Magic|same fucking cards]], and [[KKK|sticking to a theme]].

===Elements in the TCG===
There are several <s>colors</s> elements in the TCG. Note that a few of these are not the same as their video game element counterparts.
*'''[[Camel spider|Grass/Bug]]:''' Nobody played Grass, except for [[Randroid|Jim Profit]], but nobody likes him anyway. Grass involved [[Spam|using the same poison attack on twenty different cards]].
*'''[[Flamer|Fire]]:''' Fire was for dumb kids who wanted to use their favorite Pokémon for their deck. They always got beaten and had [[Communism|their good cards stolen]]. The stratagy involved doing [[mundane]] amounts of damage, and [[Women|wasting energy]].
*'''[[Piss|Water]]:''' Water decks were played by [[fag]]s who fapped to Misty. The strategy involved doing more damage by adding more energy to your Pokémon. [[Retard|OMGZ nova!]]
*'''[[Asperger's Syndrome|Psychic/Ghost]]:''' Psychic fags were always noticeable as they wanted to use [[Ass|their super rare Mewtwo card]], but you would let them because Mewtwo sucked anyway and then they'd get their asses kicked in [[Yu-Gi-Oh|a children's cardgame]].
*'''[[Internet Tough Guy|Fighting/Ground/Rock]]:''' This element was a combination of Fighting, Rock, and Ground type Pokémon from the original video game. Why they couldn't just give everyone their own elemental card still remains a mystery to this day. Fighting was for unoriginal faggots who didn't know how to do anything else but flip coins and deal damage. Needless to say, they always win.
*'''[[Nazi|Lightning]]:''' Lightning was used by [[Redundant|girls who didn't know what the fuck they were doing]]. Lightning strategy involved flipping coins to deal what other Pokémons were dealing without coinflips, and [[An Hero|Self Destruct which dealed a whole 40 damage]]. [[WOW]]!
*'''[[Steal|Steel]]:''' Steel was all about [[bike|defense and lots of HP]]. Steel had [[at least 100|a lot]] more cards in Japan, but America was scared that the cards would give American kids seizures and encourage [[communism]] because of the emphasis on [[industrial]] [[work]].
*'''[[Emo|Dark]]:''' Dark, like Steel. This was intended to be a non-basic energy that was splashed in decks. Unlike steel though, dark appealed to angst [[13 year old boys]] and there's now more Pokémon that can use Dark energy then anything else.
*'''[[Milhouse|Normal]]:''' Otherwise known as [[boring|colorless]] (or simply ''[[white]]''). Normal Pokémon could use any other energy and were a favorite of pedophiles. Players would purposely make all colorless decks, which was fucking retarded and they'd lose on purpose so [[Sex|they could be taught how to play by expert little girls]].

==[[IRL]] Controversies==
[[File:PokefagDating.jpg|thumb|left|How [[Nerd|cute]]!]]
[[Image:HitlerPikachu.jpg|thumb|Heil Führer Pikachu!]]
[[Image:Registeelheil.png|thumb|[[Bot|Registeel]], legendary Pokémon and Hauptsturmführer in the Waffen-SS.]]
*Many overprotective [[parents]] claim that Pokémon is harmful to their children, since it promotes [[chikins|cock-fighting]] and similarly [[violence|violent]] hobbies, as well as encouraging the [[Wiccan|unholy]] practice of [[magick|summoning]] [[demon]]s to settle [[serious business|childhood disputes]]. On the other hand, the [[Pope]] has condoned Pokémon as being full of positive messages, but, of course, we all know that the Pope is a [[Satanic]], [[Realm-Of-The-Shadows|fish-hat wearing]] [[Mudkips]]-lover.
*[[Creationist]]s complain that Pokémon teaches youth only about the theory of [[evolution]], and not about the alternate theory of [[intelligent design]], thereby [[time cube|educating them stupid]]. Funny how Pokémon has [[Arse|Arceus]], a deer-thing that supposedly created all the Pokémon.
*Conversely, evolutionists have condemned Pokémon on the grounds that its depiction of the process of evolution is [[O RLY?|entirely unrealistic]]; what's lulzy is that most creationists already had (and continue to [[VenomFangX|mindlessly promulgate]]) a very Pokémon view of evolution before the series was ever conceived.
*[[Feminist]]s [[Cynthia|complain that Pokémon is sexist]], since all of its "best trainers" are [[male]], [[yes|just like real life amirite guiz]]?
*Pokémon allegedly promotes [[Nazism]], since powerful Pokémon cards feature [[swastika]]s, and characters in the anime, such as Piplup, frequently <s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gBL-5Sm978 heil Hitler]</s> (DOWN).
*[[Uri Geller]] tried to sue Nintendo over [[Abra|Kadabra]], because it holds a [[The Matrix|spoon]].
*Jynx used to be a black person and [[shoop da whoop]] but [[Asphyxiation|turned purple]] due to [[BAWWWWW]].
*In 1999 two kids sued Nintendo because they claimed the card game cause their gambling addiction.
*In 2001, [[Saudi Arabia]] suffered massive butthurt and [[GTFO|b&]] Pokémon citing such reasons as "the game promotes theories of evolution, encourages [[gambling]] and, at its core, is part of a [[Jews Did WTC|Jewish conspiracy]](created by Shinto Japanese) aimed at turning children away from [[Islam]]."
*[[Jews]] themselves charge that Pokémon is [[anti-semitic]] claiming, [[shit no one cares about|among other things]], that "Pikachu" sounds suspiciously like "[[Hitler|Pick-A-Jew]]."
*Interestingly, no-one complains about other obvious [[racist]] caricatures [[Mexicans|Lombre, Ludicolo]], and [[Red Indians|Shiftry]], possibly because [[beaners]] are too occupied joining gangs and stealing white kids' [[GBA]]s for burrito money to actually play the games, while Injuns are too high on paint thinner and [[illiterate]] anyway.
*So Christians hate it because it drives kids away from their creationist bullshit, Jews hate it because it has backwards swastikas, Muslims hate it because it is a Jewish conspiracy (created by Shinto Japanese) to drive kids away from Islam.

Pokémon is usually presented as a phenomenon for children (or [[Asperger's syndrome|childlike adults]]), depicting a realm of trust and goodwill, barring a few inane antagonists along the way mostly to help you build character. However, to the discerning eye, the world of Pokémon offers a wealth of the bizarre and sinister - there are many aspects that, once you really start to think about them, become deeply creepy.

*Zubat is usually considered an annoying pest, as every encounter in a cave has a 90% chance of being a Zubat, and they offer generally shit experience rewards. But if you examine its Pokédex entry, you'll discover it's a swarming [[Don Henrie|bloodsucker]] with a three foot wingspan - suddenly it's not quite so inconsequential.

*10-year-old kids are kicked out of their homes to make creatures that could mutilate the fuck out of them fight for money. Although this may be normal in the [[Japan|Pokémon world]].
*Lavender Town. The music was so notoriously discomforting that they had to redo it for all the remakes, and it had that looming tower-mausoleum full of angry ghosts and possessed psychics. Later, in Gold/Silver, it boasts a radio tower that broadcasts the extradimensional ravings of the Unowns, a reality-warping alien hivemind. It also holds the tragic secret behind Gary Oak's badass exterior.

*Drowzees like to hypnotize and [[Madeleine McCann|kidnap small children]]. It states this in their Pokédex entry.

*Banette is a possessed [[doll]], and Haunters eat souls. Haunter's precursor form Gastly, according to its Pokédex entry, is a four-foot-in-diameter floating [[awesome|face]] that isn't stopped by doors or walls.

*MissingNo. Everything about it, especially when you consider what it would be from an in-game perspective. Some old man offers you a Weedle-catching lesson on a deserted island, and then suddenly an [[Cthulhu|eldritch horror]] that should not exist tempts you with unlimited Master Balls... and if you accept, you risk UNWRITING REALITY. Worse is when you realize MissingNo is only a fraction of the glitches you can run across - glitch trainers, worse glitch pokémon (the dreaded 'M can fuck up the ROM on the game itself, bricking the entire cartridge), and Glitch City, a R'lyeh-like metropolis of non-Euclidean architecture with theme music composed of random static, from which Fly is the ''only escape''.

*Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny are clones. This is made clear in the anime. [[Then who was X|SO WHO IS CONDUCTING THE CLONING??]]

*If a Haunter beckons you while it is floating in darkness, don't approach it. This Pokémon will try to lick you with its tongue and steal your life away. 


Go [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NightmareFuel/Ptitlei015gc004kw4 here] for more people with too much time on their hands parsing a crappy video game/anime and scaring themselves in the process.

==Harley==
[[Image:What the fuck?.jpg|thumb|[[Do not want|Harley is disgusted]]]]
[[Image:Harley.png|thumb|Harley will accept any [[cock|challenge]].]]
[[Faggot|Harley]] is May's [[Haters gonna hate|hater]]. Why? Because she called his [[Cactus|Cacturne]] creepy then tried out his [[cookies]] calling it... [[What|NOT HALF BAD!]] Thus, Harley took a picture of her and blacklisted her as a [[bitch]]. He then pretends to be friends with them and attains her [[docs]] from her [[shota|little brother]]. He records the docs and puts it on the speakers, in the middle of the contest he lets everyone know that May got [[Tentacle rape|traumatized by Tentacools]] as a child and [[Epic win|makes her cry]].

His pokemon are all [[badass]]. [[spider|Ariados]]? Cacturne? Banette? That's right.
Wait? What about WIGGLYTUFF? He trained it to be [[Awesome|a sadistic fucker.]]

Harley was a character made from a combination of butthurt Misty/Ash shippers and gays (by attracting gay people to Pokemon they would increase profits 125%). Needless to say, he appears numerous times, each episode pretending to be nice to May who [[gullible|actually believes]] him. In the Grand Festival he sabotages her by telling her to use the same move [[over 9000]] times.

In the second Grand Festival, [[Transvestite|he dresses up as May, further embarassing her by being sexier than her.]] After that he, [[Jailbait|May]], [[Emo|Drew]], and [[Mary-Sue|Solidad]] decided to travel together to Johto.

[[TL;DR]] - [[Lies|What Gary is that he was gay!]]
