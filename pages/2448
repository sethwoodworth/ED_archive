[[Image:drawhoremario.PNG|thumb|right|Sometimes when a drawhore thread inevitably reaches a certain point of fail, at least one will be smart enough to [[rule 34]] ]] 
A '''drawhore''' is an incarnation of [[faggotry]] found on [[4chan]]'s [[/b/]], brought there along with the [[Newgrounds]] and [[Gaia]] rejects and exiles, as rats and fleas were brought around the world by the British.
The word "drawhore" stems from the word "[[camwhore]]". It is basically a person who feels the intricate need to attract attention to themselves by creating and posing an avatar instead of using real pictures, just as one would at [[Gaia Online]]. 

Drawhores have been widely overlooked and been recognized as part of [[the cancer that is killing /b/]]. When you see a drawhore, you will know it by these signs:
#Relatively little or horribly wasted [[Shitty art|drawing skill]].
#Desire to bring attention to oneself. Orgasmic reaction when succeeding.
#Complete lack of shame.

As of 1/1/10 Drawhoring is dead. All that you will see now on 4chan are the occasional request thread.

==Creation of the Drawhore==
[[Attention whore]]s were first created by ingesting the happy slappy fruit of faggery.
With the eradication of the name/tripcode input on /b/, [[attention whore]]s needed a new outlet with which to cause [[internet drama]] and attempt to become [[internet superheroes]]. By keeping to drawings instead of using cameras, they are able to hide their utter repulsiveness as well as avoid being categorized as "just another dumbass [[camwhore]]".
Because of this, they have been able to slip under the radar of the senior [[trolls]] and spammers. However, they have been gaining more recognition lately, as is evidenced by an increase in trolling their threads.

It is thought that the creation of the drawhore was mainly stemmed by the increased traffic that /b/ is now receiving from sources of faggotry such as Gaia and Newgrounds, as no true /b/tard would ever subjugate themselves to that kind of [[failure]].

<center>{{bigpic|Pooftheyaregone.jpg|600|250|Thread where the drawhores said goodbye,e- penis enlargement and faggotry for everybody! drawhores purpose is entertain, not creating drama. get it right tards!}}</center> 

[[Image:Boxdog.jpg|thumb|left|The badly drawn dog in question. Original artist apparently has a fetish for crying and rape.]] 
==Notorious Drawhores==
[[Image:anonchan.jpg|thumb|right|Fail at hentai art Anon-Chan? Don't worry! Your baby barf will be accepted as "teh hottest thing evar" at /b/!]]
[[Image:Boxdogrule34.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rule_34|No exceptions.]]]]
===SadBoxDog===
One of the more recent of drawhores and a self-hating [[furry]]. Created a series of threads about how "she" was so sad, had been raped, was ''being'' raped, and how it sucks so much to be a badly drawn dog ''with an addiction to smoking''. Ended in a climax of her dying or something. (I don't know. It was too retarded to follow without being forced to bludgeon my head against the wall.)

She managed to spawn a group of lifeless [[faggots]] who went on to [[circlejerk]] over her memory in [[at least 100]] threads everyday.

===Anon-Chan===
Another drawhore that managed to spark a [[circlejerk]]. Started innocent enough, and then when she deemed she wasn't getting enough attention, she started drawing bad hentai of her bald horrible looking female anonymous character. As with any drawhore, if you insult her, her army of 12 year old [[fanboys]] will rabidly attack you for neither seeing the artistic merit of a non-anonymous anonymous female ([[anonymous|ANONYMOUS]]!!!!!!!), nor "teh hotness". Fan art of "Anon-chan" is generally much better looking than her own scribbles, but still fails to be attractive.

Disappeared not too long ago (maybe she hit her head and her shame gland turned on). Threads are still cropping up about her to this very day.

The artist for Anon-Chan is actually the same drawhore for Boxdog and Chainchomp-chan. Don't tell anyone though cause because being a drawhore is an "important" secret identity.

[[Image:chainchomp.png|thumb|left|LOL WTF '''CHAINCHOMP TITS''']]
===Chainchomp-chan===
Possibly the most ill-conceived of drawhores. <br>
Seriously, what the fuck is that thing? Is that Ms. Pac-Man + torso + tits? <br>
No! It's a female version of a Mario baddie!

Chainchomp-chan threads generally go like this:
#hay guyz! Can I have my own thread?
#TITS OR GTFO
#<nowiki>*tits*</nowiki>
#IN BEFORE RAPE
#<nowiki>*Chainchomp is raped*</nowiki>
#'''''<nowiki>*Pathetic 13-year-olds masturbate furiously*</nowiki>'''''

''How one even rapes a razor-sharp teethed living metal ball tied to a stake is beyond me.''

''How '''CAN'T''' you rape something tied to a stake?''

[[Image:Cap-tan.png|thumb|Cap-tan]]
===Cap-tan===
Drawn by a guy, '''Cap-tan''' was born from a "gender bender" thread in /i/ but reached her fame in /b/. her debut thread failed as a trolling attempt since most of the anonymous users liked her  submissive character, always willing to wear shoes on head, show TITS, fry her clothes, and other stuff.

A majority of cap-tan threads are created by a sad fanboy under the name of repost guy, who spammed during the GET race of April 2007 and still reposts the same tired images. Her most remarkable achievement might be her (failed and unfinished) doujin, which is basically page after page of fanservice. Anonymous is still trying to decide if this is win or fail.

===Other well known Drawhores===
Drawhores that regularly had [[circlejerk]] orgies in threads on a nightly basis until the exodus.
{{cg||draw1|left|<gallery>
Image:SAL.PNG|<b>S.A.L</b> is believed to be some kind of a rogue ipod. S.A.L. has had several threads, mostly filled with [[fail]], but you know being angry and yelling is [[troll|ALWAYS FUNNY]]
Image:Loveisover.jpg|An angry ipod and a can of beans be mean to each other over the internet. Truly, this is a testament to the drawhore imagination.
Image:Duke-baconsfield.png|The <b>Duke of Beaconsfield</b> thinks he is a Real Life Duke and a modern day James Bond, but really he is just an [[unfunny]], badly drawn, [[chibi]] avatar that prompts other drawhores to show up like a [[fail|fail magnet]]. He becomes only slightly more entertaining when set on [[fire]].
Image:Anonkun.gif|<b>Anonkun</b> is the male contemporary of Anon-chan, although it is unclear who was created first. He is characterized by a round head and trench coat, and alternates between sunglasses, a question-mark face, or a combination of the two. Anonkun embodies the essence of [[Anonymous]] by killing things and getting raped.
</gallery>|<gallery>
Image:Sniperchan.jpg|<b>Sniperchan</b> epitomizes the dilemma of the drawhore. She at once wishes to entertain anonymous by killing furfags while not causing drama. The dillema is that whenever any original content is created, anonymous is split between "Awesome, [[moar]]!" and "shit sux [[GTFO]]!" This causes internet [[drama]], which attracts furfags just like [[IRL]] drama attracts real life [[faggot]]s. Thus driving the drawhore to the edges of madness and beyond.
Image:DramaticEFG.gif|Despite what others may tell you, the maskless <b>EFG</b> was a member of the original drawhores, and creator of several epic threads. However, the explosion of unfunny newfags that all tried to copy and imitate EFG and gain his glory drove him to post less frequently. May pop up from time to time; unknown if there is just one EFG.

===The Not-So-Notorious Drawhores===
drawhores you have probably never heard of.
{{cg||draw2|left|<gallery>
image:virgin.png|Goes by the name "<b>Virgin-chan</b>" or "<b>kun</b>" or something. Can usually be found invading up other people's threads. At least his name fits him. It is said that he had a sexual relationship with Paint d00d. Has been seen on /b/ as of 2009.
image:mustache.png|Accurately named "<b>Mustache guy</b>". Like "Virgin-chankun", can be found ruining other's threads.
image:Archer.jpg|Named "<b>Archer</b>" or something. Has a habit of bringing even more failure to [[roleplaying|RP]] threads by combining the two with his drawhoring.  He is also [[lie|NOT]] a total ripoff of Dante from the game Devil May Cry.
image:D-r-awhore.jpg|<b>D/r/awhore</b> is an artfag who doesn't try to tell a consistent story with shitty images of his character. Instead he just draws [[shitty art]] of other people's characters and [[rule 34]] requests.
</gallery>|<gallery>
image:Drawbunny-chan.jpg|<b>[[Drawbunny-chan]]</b> is a drawhore [[furry|with a thing for bunnies]].
image:OneViTwoVi.png|A furfag creation, <b>Vi</b>'s life on /b/ was expected to be short from the start. She came, was redesigned and left in the literal course of two days. She is currently a major character in a shitty comic drawn in the same style.
image:New_Rock_spray.png‎|Called "<b>The Rock</b>", but more often called plain "<b>Rock</b>", known for his hatred for female drawhores. He is usually found ruining animu roleplayer's threads and other threads in general. Has been spotted posting in /a/ and /v/. He has also been spotted in [[Team Fortress 2|TF2]]. He is complete garbage and a total faggot, not to mention some kind of nigger and a bloody annoying spy.
image:Mute1.png|<b>Mute-chan</b> is an older drawhore whose sole gimmick consists of being a [[retard|mute]]. Was MIA for several months but recently reappeared on /b/. Does decent requests, unlike most of the other [[faggot|faggots]] here.
image:Patachu666.png|[[Patachu]] is a creepy satanic [[digimon]] [[Mangina|cuntboi]], resident [[troll]] and [[furry]] in denial. He established /g/ as his lair, in an endless war against Apple, but sometimes invades /k/,/v/,/ic/ and /r9k/. he just illustrates his posts with his avatar on mspaint instead of evolving in [[lolwut|quality anthro-drawings.]] He's also the creator of the [[rule34|Iriver hentai]] and various hardware #34, including his own character.
Image:Astro.png|<b>Astro</b> is /co/'s pride and joy. Armed with both a ridiculous mohawk and drawing ability, she pumps out requests above the level of most others. Aside from being lazy, she could be considered one of the last of the good drawhores.
Image:Lolfutas.png| Spends most of his time lurking in drawhore threads waiting for futanari to show up, at which point he starts posting. He stops again before too long, as nobody gives a shit about anything he says. Every /r/ he takes results in him posting the finished picture long after the anon who requested it leaves, despite the simplicity of them. Seems to at least be aware of his lack of skill, since most of his posts /r/ porn of anything involving gender-bending, futanari, or mecha instead of drawing it himself.

===Drawhores 2: The Suckening===
With the mass exodus of many of the more prominent drawhores, a new group has recently appeared to fill the void of shit with more shit. most of these threads are met with the ever-familiar sage-spamming and calls to "bring back [[epic_fail_guy|EFG]]"
{{cg||draw3|left|<gallery>
Image:Moot-chan-chan.jpg|Since this drawhore refused to name itself, [[anonymous]] put forward the names <b>moot-chan-chan</b>, <b>Temp-chan</b>, and <b>STFU and GTFO faggot</b>. it responds to all three. this drawhore mostly does [[/b/]] and [[meme]] related images.
Image:Moot-ch-ch-thread.jpg|the first thread that the moot-chan-chan drawhore officially made. full of [[gaia]]fags and fail.
Image:Banned-like-snacks.jpg|A singing thread by moot-chan-chan that mysteriously coincided with the return to non-flashing of the /b/ board for 23mGET. Is moot-chan-chan a mod?
Image:Bamo.jpg|Yet more proof that the drawhores are a symptom of the influx of [[gaia]]fags is <b>Bamo</b>, a drawhore based on a pet from the weeaboo-loved online game [[Ragnarok Online|Fagnarok Online]]. Bamo is known to share a fetish for apples with polar bears.
</gallery>|<gallery>
Image:Maekpie.jpg|A screencap of a Bamo thread, in which you will witness his vice-like grip on the English language, audience participation, and perhaps an insight into where the other drawhores all went.
Image:MrK-Smiling.jpg|Is it furry? It's supposedly an "alien." <b>Mr. K</b> is an irritating drawhore that refuses to have alien sex or kill things. Besides appearing in any thread (not just drawhore threads) like a cancer, it has oppositely proven to be somewhat entertaining by wearing [[Anonymous]] suggested costumes.
Image:Epic_fail_guy.gif|unfunny faggot with no artistic skills, bumps his own threads pretending he's someone else
Image:pigunrelated.jpg|pig obviously unrelated.
Image:Seanlawyer.PNG|First seen in Nov 07', <b>Sean Wolfe</b> is thought to be a furry corruption of Phoenix Wright. A second character is said to be this drawhore's partner, but that doesnt stop it from yiffing in hell.
Image: Draconis.gif|The dragonlike <b>Draconis</b> was first seen before Sean Wolfe, and is believed to be made by the same artist who draws that other furry. Not this one on the left. The other one.
Image:Kyosan.GIF|The completely unentertaining <b>Stick-Kyo</b> enjoys hijacking drawhore threads, then just sitting and smoking. What a fag. Kyo is from the gay [[J-Rock]] band, Dur en gay.
Image:Drawfurfag.gif|A furfaggot who goes by the name <b>ArpegiusWolf</b> tries to make friends or join threads by posting his gay [[fursona]].

===Drawhores 3: back from outer space===
[[Image:Havinagoodtime.jpg|thumb|right|the 'return' thread in question.]]
On 4-22-07 a thread was posted that had all the old vanished drawhores singing "Don't stop me now" by Queen. Few doubted that the song selection was based on the fact that Freddie Mercury was a massive [[faggot]] and died of [[aids]]. There is a great deal of contention between /b/tards as to whether this is a bona fide thread from the drawfag /b/luminati or just one lonely fat shit in his basement with nothing else to do spreading lies. After great discussion it was decided that nobody gives a shit.

True to their nature of hating [[shitty art|everything original]] a lone furfag proceeded to attempt to kill the [[circlejerk]] by using an automated program to post spam of [[shitty art|the usual bland tripe from]] [[deviantART]].

as of this date, it is unknown whether this means a return of the faggotry and attempts at entertaining [[anonymous]] with 30 second doodles or if this was just a rare one-off occasion.

===Drawhores 4: The return of suck===
Even in the face of the drawpocalypse a few new drawhores have shown their faces. These daredevils go against the "traditional rules" of being a drawhore and do so for more selfish reasons than simply trying to entertain. Meaning mostly they suck ass. Some examples of these include:
{{cg||draw4|left|<gallery>
Image:PaintAddict.png|'''PaintAddict''', or '''PA''', is a rather old, but not famous drawhore. He is a frequent on /r9k/, but has been known to visit /b/ and /v/. He also draws a range of characters, but mostly uses a spiked hair character.  On July 14, 2008, he was spotted on every board in 7chan, 420chan, and 4chan. It is rumored that he is the creator of the original EFG and several other famous characters. He made no comment on the rumor.
Image:Toothykawaii.png|'''Toothy''' is exactly what she looks like: Timmy Turner with boobs, and HUGE hips. Through porn and horribly wasted talent, she has ascended to become an exalted queen/goddess of the drawhores in a short time, despite her obsession with butts, drawing furry porn, and front teeth that could chew through an oak.  
Image:Ehg.png|'''Gurblebot''' is a small robotic drawhore whos posts consist of nothing. Literally nothing happens. Ever. The most boring Drawhore. Hated the most among the other robotic drawhores.
Image:failus.png|'''Failius''' is a robotic drawhore from Faghammer who is a total racist and douche. Enemy of EHG. He was recently found to be a giant purple robotic dildo. More as this discovery develops.
</gallery>|<gallery>
Image:shine.png|GIGANTIC FAGGOT. FUCK HIM HER OR IT.
Image:angryanon.png|'''AA''', or '''Angry Anon''' is one of the worst new drawhores to fag up /b/. Arrogant and compulsively fat, he schemes with a super computer hacker by the name of Dirk and his lackeys. Rumored to be a high ranking member of a rogue group of drawhores.
Image:noire.png|'''Noire''' is a drawhore without the most basic understanding of anatomy or how to be funny. Tried to cope by being "loldark" known by the other drawhores as "The baddest of the bads".
Image:cuppy.jpg|'''Cuppy''' is a drawhore with a legend behind him. It said that this Canadian based drawhore will become the most popular drawhore that there ever will be in the history of the internets. But whoever said that was an idiot. Rumored to be the leader of The Council.
Image:ehg2.png|'''EHG''', '''Epic Hair Guy''', or '''GurbleDerp Fail Emperor''', '''Master of Gurblebot''', AKA "'''spikey haired faggot'''" Is known for blah blah blah what a faggot. Spreads confusion and misfits everywhere. Is actually bald. He is also Dream's [[bitch|husband]].
Image:saltchan.png|'''Salt-chan''' was drawhore and is now shunned by the drawhore community for being [[butthurt|too good at drawhoring]]. '''Salt-chan''' was legendary at using a mouse to craft superior artwork. All of the other drawhores are just jealous of her superb use of the English language.
Image:kittenchan.jpg|'''Kittenchan''' is a failure of a drawhore is drawn by a 70 year furry old man who couldn't be funny to save his own life. Burn on sight.
Image:madmax.png|'''MadMax''' is drawhore tries to act like a cool cat, it might be a furry, it might be a man, but he tries to bond with anon in a manly way. His threads are always about fixing cars and having sex. EYYYYYYY lets jump over a shark.
Image:broom.jpg|Broom is faggot of a drawhore would try to get in other drawhore threads and make them far worse than what they were. He was always successful.
Image:Splinegirl.png|Splinegirl is a drawhore that appears to only post outside of /b/ and will often give advice to people who aren't asking for it.
Image:happyface.png|'''HFA''', or '''Happy faced anon''' is a drawhore who mostly does request threads. Is a zealous member of the drawhore Illuminati, The Council
Once nude, she quickly adopted a shirt as a big "fuck you" to all of them and had a habit of going [[batshit insane]] regularly.
Image:Pyramid-chan.jpg|'''Pyramid-chan''' is known for her heavily artifacted images and templates, Pyramid-chan got her name from originally being a female version of [[Silent Hill|Pyramid Head]]. Lately, however, she seems to abuse and whore herself in a feeble attempt to earn love. Lost her right hand at some point.
Image:Dewbud_0001.png|'''Dewbud.''' Highly inconsistent in his art, Dewbud is noted for his hatred of furries and love of drawing [[Rule 34|porn]]; especially of Bushbaby. Unlike Salt-chan, he shunned other drawhores after a drama-fest about his ideas [[BAWWWWW|not getting enough attention]]- probably due to not having any actual skill.
Image:kosh.png|'''Kosh''' is known for inhabiting /co/ and being a worthless namefag.
Image:BlueBeetle_WHYWOULDYOUDOTHAT.png|'''Vorked Larfleeze''' self-proclaimed /co/mmander of /co/ and traces shitty reaction images into even shittier reaction images of Blue Beetle.
Image:Cloak.png|'''Cloak''' AKA '''Boxdog's''' is a [[newfag|new]] drawhore/DevianTARD who can often be found on /b/ obsessing over the drawhore events that he was never a part of.
Image:Sana.gif|'''Sana/Garde-chan''' is a drawhore who spends her time showing up in roleplay threads and occasionally raping people, has a few fans due to her slut like behavior.
Image:Notfairbigsmile.JPG|'''Tanner''' is supposedly a DevianTARD who eventually became fond of drawhoring. He usually draws himself raping furfags or possibly bitching at furfags for being furfags.
Image:Jessicatheskank.jpg|'''Jessica''' is a new character who is [[some say|rumored]] to be the creation of an older drawhore. She speaks like a 12 year-old with brain damage and has arms the thickness of toothpicks, but /b/ jizzes their pants just to see her. Will remove clothing and pose in a [[lie|sexy]] manner but has yet to deliver any goods, despite screams of [[tits or gtfo|TITS or GTFO]].
Image:Milo508.jpg|'''Rumored''' to have spawned in the depths of a lesser chan, Milo is notorious among drawhores for his touch of fail; any thread he enters immediately turns to shit and must be purged with sagebombs before dying a horrific death.
Image:Trapkungrinning.png|Trap-kun, AKA "dude that looks like Ron Stoppable", was one of the more skilled drawhores in the past year. However, he suffered from a crippling condition of unfunniness which led to a quick demise and disappearance from everyone's memory. Owns a cat.
Image:Boros015.png|'''Boros''' is, ostensibly, a shortening of the much cooler-sounding name "Ouroboros"; at least it was before the Japanese and animufags raped it. He is a pathetic worm who tries to act dark and cool on /x/ while riding the coattails of better, more famous drawhores.  
Image:Portugal.png|A denizen of /r9k/, '''Portugal''' ignores the cries of others to stop making terrible threads and spreads his cancer throughout the board. Unlike other wizards with venerable beards and a plethora of cool spells, all he has are shitty ice powers and a costume he picked up at Goodwill. He does parties, and people actually go to them, but only because everyone knows Portugal is a cripple with no friends and would kill himself if nobody showed up. Nobody wants that kind of guilt.
Image:Haze.png|Haze is an emo grimdark Godzilla wannabe that touts himself as "god of rape", making shit MSpaint threads of himself raping inanimate objects. In reality he hasn't raped anything in years, and remains leader of the nigger furries.
Image:Hellstroem.gif|'''Hellströem''' is a bon vivant and [[rapist|playboy]], and Gold Member of Plus4chan. Most of his posts consist of groping women or men, making unwanted sexual advances, getting nude, or surreal events that suggest it's [[jenkem|not tobacco]] he's smoking. Still alive.
Image:Somedude01.gif| '''Some Dude''' is a fail stick figure who appeared on 4chan during it's 5th anniversary. He usually just sits there arguing with people or smoking a cigarette. He ran for about 5 months before he permanently an heroed in one of EHG's fail threads in /r9k/. It is unknown if he will come back to life. And nothing of value was lost.
Image:TRIP.jpg|'''TRIP''' occasionally host's request threads on /r9k/ but recently ran away to a completely different chan after the shame of being completely shunned by the robot.

===Drawhores 5: The Exile===
More recently, Drawhores have been migrating away from 4chan to make their festering nests elsewhere, going so far as to host their very own board. After countless civil wars and nomadic moves, they have resolved their issues peacefully and have agreed to eat shit and die alone. Among the 5th generation of failures:
{{cg||draw5|left|<gallery>
Image:Kimonochan.gif| Kimonochan is an unfortunate soul, you see when she was conceived in the back of a pig sty deep in the heart of texas, the stars aligned and perhaps for a few years after she was born she was a strikingly beautiful [[loli]] to fondle instead of the malnourished hillbilly her heritage normally produces. But then as she matured her features warped to become a horrible quasimodo-esque dwarf with a permanent case of the mumps that everyone laughed at all through adolescence. To counter this she mostly draws a really shitty chibi character wearing a kimono in the hopes that people will see it and assume she is chibi as well. But beware the hideous dwarf. Beware. Her foul chin will consume you should you turn your back on her.
Image:Thomas_dw.jpg| '''Thomas''' is an ill-tempered drawhore, prone to quickly swing his [[cock|chainsaw]] around when things [[you mad|don't go his way]]. Inspired by childhood heroes like Duke Nukem, his goal in life is to [[masturbate|seek out women]] and kill the bad guys.
Image:Never4get.jpg| <b>mook</b> 2009-2010.
Image:Bromancer.jpg| <b>Typical Necromancer</b> Is an agreeable, calming presence in whatever thread he appears in.  He has a dark streak of Skooma abuse in parody of Morrowind's illegal drug.
</gallery>|<gallery>
Image:Whywouldyou.png|'''EMG''' ('''Epic Mustache Guy''') is a totally unoriginal stick figure with something on his face that should resemble a mustache. EMG is often found raging because he is a [[Netherlands|Dutchfag]]. In short: unfunny butthurt faggot. More recently adorned a jester's outfit, resembling a bad Kefka lookalike.
Image:Balloon2000.png|'''Balloon''' is <s>one of the most talented Drawhores. He is known for his unrivaled funniness and wit. It is also said that he has a very large penis.</s> DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS.
Image:Nhh.png|<b>Naomi Hook Hands</b> is a little teenage girl with hooks for hands. Apparently she lost them after she was found outside of the kitchen. It is rumored that the artist is also a teenage girl.
Image:Fat nerd chick.jpg| '''Rebecca''' is a rare case of drawhores who are honest about their weight. Popular among chubby chasers, she is easily recognizable by her spiral glasses, and emo hair. Known for never having failed to deliver a request. Her vagina is known to contain a portal to a hellish dimension.
Image:Eve.jpg| A lesbian drawhore with no notable skill, '''Eve''' is generally found sulking on drawchan. She is a (hardly) active participant in the drawhore community, sometimes taking rule 34 requests for Anonymous, and drawing a few of the female drawhores. Easily trolled, easily butthurt.
Image:Mizser.jpg| '''Mizser''' is a jackass who begged /b/ for, what, weeks? to add him to ED. When nobody would, he committed the masturbatory act of adding himself. In short, Futa.
Image:Stocky.png| '''Stockholm Dad''' AKA "Stocky" AKA "Slut" is a generic Twilight loving vampire-fag. She lurks Drawchan until an opportunity to contribute arises, then proceeds to post nothing of value. She is popular on 420chan, under the alias "Blair."
Image:Cajjita.PNG|'''Cajjita''' added himself, like everyone else here. Another typical generic anime haired template. Tends to do spontaneous things to get attention by way of LOLRANDUM. <s>He's also the coolest drawhore ever</s> '''I SUCK COCKS TOO.'''
Image:Higgzz.png|'''Higgz''' is a talentless fuck wearing Ash ketchum's hat who does nothing but play video games all day. Mostly seen on drawchan but is sometimes seen on /v/ doing nothing but tripfagging.
Image:Dreamydreamydreamy.png |'''Dream''' AKA Butterface McCool is a bipolar manic depressive attention addict who lives in the basement of a ruined catholic church deep in the highlands of Ireland. Dream is perhaps the last person alive to take things people say about her on the internet seriously and if you say anything even slightly negative about her to anyone she either goes apeshit or cries until a male, hypnotized by her ample breasts, whiteknights for her and changes this ED article just so she can continue the charade that people actually enjoy her company for anything more than that she has a vagina.
Image:Hanoweeaboo.jpg| '''Hano''' was born from the bowels of weeaboo hell. This drawfag's drawings are riddled with the all too common, overused, cliche, and actiony "speedlines". Why this drawfag finds it neccessary to plague everyone with his animu-inspired fight scenes is beyond anyone's guess. Fortunately enough, he is going to die alone, only to realize his waifu does not exist.
Image:1275706980303.png| '''Drawxxy''' is a teasing bitch who came to /b/ as a typical drawhore, but thanks to the masses (four or five samefagging idiots) has been proclaimed /b/'s new queen. Suck it, Boxxy. Also, she drew herself riding Kevin the Snipe. Fucking win.

===Drawhores 6: The Coming of the Scribblefags===
After the big ban of Summer '10, a cataclysmic event that destroyed all of drawfag civilazation as they knew it, most, if not all, of the prominent drawfags fled to drawchan.org and other various not important enough to be named places, never to be seen again. In their wake, new drawhores filled the void, forever cursing 4chan with their faggotry.

{{cg||draw6|left|<gallery>
Image:Body.gif|'''DoMaya''' likes adding himself to places, so he joins any drawfag thread he can as EFG. Usually his comedy is ignored but he has his moments.
Image:rinfaggot.jpg|'''Rin''' is another not so well known draw whore, she hopelessly clings to whatever threads she can find and has gone as far as to make a new thread before the previous 404's. Do not trust her with a tablet, you will be dissapoint.
Image:ZeDoktor.png|'''Doctorandus''' is a Dutch drawhore who is best known for his '''failed attempt''' at looking cool, sporting shades and large collared lab-coat that together mask the fact he '''can't draw faces'''. He'd like to be recognized for his uncaring nature and hatred for all, but they aren't really defining characteristics. He also wears some unintentionally laughable '''elf shoes'''.
</gallery>|<gallery>
Image:TheGUI.jpg |'''THE GUY''', simply known as that, is a Brazilian drawhore who recently gave his drawing style a flip it stick it and improved greatly, making his character 400% more likable as well. Often mocked or misunderstood for his inability to grammar properly (on account of English being his second language) has been demoralized on numerous occasions. HE ALSO FUCKING DRAWS IN JPG'S.
Image:Gravvy.jpg |'''Gravy''' fairly new drawhore taking on the persona of a cynical robot that gave the drawhore community the slap in the face it needed. All he really needed was a hug.
Image:Nozo.png |'''Nozo''' Nozo is a freak girl with no eyes and a striped tutu. The artist is an underage ban who will do anything for attention. Is known to pop up in the 4chan /x/ board with her faggotry.
Image:OCdraw.PNG|'''OC''' is a drawhore who gained his fame through "choose your own adventure" threads, talk-directly-to-anon threads and story threads on /b/. He claims his name comes from his intention to bring original content to /b/, however, he tends to repost most of his images rather than make new ones.

Image:Meh-359.gif|'''Meh Guy''' is a new guy who is a clone of the real Epic Fail Guy, who fails at being epic and sometimes reposts his previous images. Recently, some people have mistaken him as the actual unmasked EFG.

==The Drawhore/Drawfag Dispute==
Recently there has been some contention over exactly what the difference between a drawhore and a drawfag is. Some say that the drawhore consists of the "attention whore/camwhore" that uses an avatar to garner praise or infamy instead of just posting pictures of themselves; probably because the actual artist is hideous or has a penis. Even with the return of the name/tripcode feature on /b/ they still exist, possibly as trolls. Others claim that the "whore" in the name is a reference to the fact that some will "whore" themselves out to Anon and draw whatever is requested of them. The drawfags, conversely, are labeled as being completely unfunny and circle-jerkers, creating threads where a bunch of template characters do nothing but talk and "fag up the place". A recent theory has been put forth that the drawhores are females and the drawfags are males, but this has been discredited as being simply stupid. The smart people, however, have accurately said that anyone who cares is a loser and should an hero immediately as it doesn't fucking matter.
Current situation defines "drawhores" as faggots who contribute nothing to threads and are there only to show their face and name, "drawfags" as people who are entertaining to some degree and are able to contribute.
