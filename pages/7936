Swear Jar
This is the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] '''Swear Jar'''.  Every time a user uses an ethnic slur on this site, he or she must put a quarter into the jar.  In this fashion, the Swear Jar works much like any real life swear jar, but it is only reserved for /b/tards who come here to make ethnic slurs, because evidently that is funny to 12 year olds.  Please do your part and put a quarter in for your past transgressions.
