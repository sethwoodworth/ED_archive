MMORPG
<!--



                       HEY THERE:

                       THE MMO LIST ONLY NEEDS LIKE ONE OR TWO LINES OR SOMETHING.

                       STOP COMPARING EVERY MMO TO WOW OR EQ (A FEW TIMES IS FINE, BUT

                       NOT FOR EVERY GAME.)


                       THANKS!!

'''MMORPG''' is an acronym for '''M'''assive '''M'''ultiplayer '''O'''nline '''R'''ole '''P'''laying '''L'''ife '''C'''onsuming '''G'''ame. This can also be referred to as '''M'''assive '''M'''ega '''O'''nline '''R'''aping '''P'''okemanz '''G'''urofest or in more accurate terms: '''M'''any '''M'''ales '''O'''nline '''R'''ole '''P'''laying '''G'''irls.  An [[MMORPG]] is an unpaid, expensive, hard, boring, tiring and drama-generating job. The whole sense of MMORPG is that you pay to become [[fat]] and to keep your virginity. MMORPG's are also unique in that they are the only known method of living your ''own'' life vicariously. Which is pathetic. And more than a little bit sad. Actually, it's very, very, very sad. Sadder than [[Fag|Richard Simmons]], even.

MMORPGs are a sinister [[Communist]] plot. They enthrall people to the point where they don't bother to shower, shave, sleep, eat, drink, get up to go to the bathroom, or take care of their children. This must be communist [[magick]] because the gameplay of every MMORPG goes as follows: Do something. Do the same thing again. Keep doing it 9 hours a day every day for the rest of your life. MMORPGs are like having a job except you pay for it instead of making money. ''[[EverQuest]]'', for example, is called "''EverCrack''" in an [[unfunny]] attempt at fanboy humor, but few know that the game is actually in fact laced with [[drugs|crack]]. 

People actually fucking sell magic items from MMORPGs on [[eBay]], thus unintentionally making a brilliant satire of [[capitalism]]. MMORPGs also have their own mafias, the members of which are obviously all <strike>[[azn]]s</strike> [[Japanophiles]] who don't know all MMORPG's are made in Korea.

Fortunately for [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], however, MMORPGs can generate massive [[lulz]] and [[drama]] if successfully [[trolled]].

==Massively Multiplayer Online Transgender Simulation==
A lot of male humans IRL seem to enjoy playing a female character on MMORPGs. To most people this would be a sign of being queer or something similar, but when confronting a player who does this, they'll usually counter with something along the lines of; "I don't wanna sit around watching a guys ass move all day" or "I just want sum eyecandy". Is this really a desire for some softcore porn? Or is it a cry for a sex change? Do you ever hear of girls playing as guys on MMORPGs? As a matter of fact, have you ever heard of a girl playing as any kind of character on a MMORPG?  Only the [[fat|morbidly obese]], and [[12_year_old_girls|underage]] [[emo]]s.

The alternative is that the player has a god complex -- usually evident to the player -- which causes them to create characters that act as a controlled underling rather than a digital version of the player.  This likely comes from failing at real life, so someone will pay, even if that person is their own creation within someone else's creation.

==The ONE Good Thing About Them [[IRL]]==
MMORPG's are total motherfucking shit. EVERYONE knows THAT. However, one theory states that "the [[moar]] you [[win]] at an MMORPG, the [[moar]] you [[fail]] at life."

So, this basically means that all those fat-ass [[basement-dwellers]] living with their parents will spend [[over 9000|thousands]] of consecutive hours on their comps, eventually resulting in their death. This happens all the time in [[China]], where the only difference between an [[America|American]] MMORPG player and a [[azn|Chinese]] one, is that the Chinese one actually gets out of the house and goes to [[an hero|die]] at a cybercafe. This has happened many a time. The [[azn]] sits himself down at a comp and STAYS THERE for DAYS until he dies of many a cause: dehydration, starvation, doesn't take a [[shit]]/piss, exhaustion, or the [[lulz|very fun]] ALL OF THE ABOVE.

[[fail|Some of them make it though.]] They have a heart attack or faint or something and get rushed to a hospital. If they were ''really'' '''[[hardcore]]''', then they'd commit [[an hero]] and [[lulz|screw everyone over]] at the cafe.

The [[unfunny|less funny]] opposite to the theory is of course: "the [[moar]] you [[fail]] in an MMORPG, the [[moar]] [[typical|normal]] you are [[IRL]]."

*'''[[Sony Online Entertainment]]''' - Trolls the MMORPG community repeatedly and does an [[A Plus]] job at this. If they dare even breathe on one of their games, the players shit themselves.
