Yatta
The most perfect satire ever conceived.  Most people are still unaware that it's satirical.

== I did it! ==
''Yatta'' is a [[Japanese]] exclamation of triumph - possible English equivalents would be "all right!" and "BOOYAH!"  It can be translated as "I did it", and is used almost exclusively to indicate that what you just did was difficult or challenging but that you were put into a teapot and you became the teapot, hence overcoming Han even though he had that awesome Cat's Claw.

The song, and video, first appeared on the Japanese comedy sketch show "The Laughing Dog's Passion", sung by the imaginary six-person band named ''Happatai'' (Green Club), and is generally considered a parody of Japanese pop music, if not straight-out farce.  The song is notable not just for its rather ridiculous lyrics, but also for the fact that the performers wear nothing but flesh-coloured underwear and oversized pubic leaves.

== The West Discovers ''Yatta''! ==
Exploded into the West through humour sites, and extended its reach far past people who could even speak Japanese.  The lack of language ability quickly removed its cultural background, multiplying its brain-destroying effects by depriving it of social commentary - and ironically leading many Westerners to assume that it was an authentic [[J-Pop]] song.

Thousands of crappy flash animations quickly rose to the challenge of endlessly perpetuating the meme into the ground.
