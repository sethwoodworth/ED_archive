[[Fuck for Forest]] is a [[Norwegian]] [[porn]] activism site. What is porn activism, you ask? Well, in this case, it's a bunch of [[vegan]] [[hippie]] fjord monkeys fucking in public to [[Global warming|save the rainforest]].

{{Quote|When we started, we got founds from the Norwegian government. They knew we were working on an alternative environmental project. Porn is not exactly legal in Norway. But FFF is not really porn ether. Not more than a private video of two lovers is porn. Anyway our first media attention in Norway was; the government is sponsoring environmental porn.|[http://www.fuckforforest.com/AboutFFF.html FFF Faq]}}
