Captain Jack
'''Captain Jack''' can refer to the following:

*[[Jack Sparrow|'''Captain Jack Sparrow,''']] main character of the Pirates Of The [[Palin|Caribou Barbie]] movies. Runs around acting generally awesome and stoned. Played by Johnny Depp doing an inexplicable Keith Richards impersonation. His childishly amused face is a [[4chan]] [[meme]].
*'''Captain Jack Harkness,''' who rather than being a dimension-hopping pirate is a dimension-hopping arse-pirate from the fifty year old British sci-fi series [[Doctor Who]]. He is played by the flamboyantly camp John Barrowman, a Scottish theatre queen raised in Canada to have a fake American accent, and got his own spinoff show where he did Spike from [[Buffy]].
*'''Captain Jack,''' a German dance act consisting of a Franky Gee (a shouting, camp nigra who left the US army because he was a [[faggot|pacifist]]) stapled to an increasingly hot succession of laughably fuckable women. This year's model is called Illi Love. Captain Jack laid waste to entire continents with his campness and shoutyness after the [[Weeaboo]] menace spread his music across the world via the vector of [[Dance Dance Revolution]].
*'''Captain Jack (song),''' [[shit nobody cares about|a song by Billy Joel featured on his 1973 album Piano Man]]
