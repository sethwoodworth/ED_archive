Candwich
[[File:Candwich.jpg|thumb|240px|BBQ Candiwch is definitely the best selling item on the Candwich line.]]
The brilliant marketing and research department at [http://markonefoods.com markonefoods] spent millions beyond millions of dollars trying to develop the next food of the 21st century and after years of painstaking work, they came up with the cutting edge '''Candwich'''. The sandwich in a can with a CANDY SURPISE!!1 inside. 

==Development==
Scientists from around the world were recruited by [[Black_Jesus|the most powerful men in the world]] to develop a long lasting product that could be eaten in a bomb shelter had a nuclear war started. [[Black Jesus|The president]] called upon Markonefoods to make a delicious substance that would have a long shelf life, preferably fried chicken or BBQ chicken, maybe grape soda with possibly a [[watermelonz|watermelon]] candy surprise. To reach the requests of our [[Black_Jesus|lord and savior]], the scientists had come up with the most delectable piece of food known to man with a shelf life of [[over_9000| over nine thousand mother fucking years]]. The scientists had made a combination of all three of the presidents preferences: fried chicken, [[watermelonz|watermelon]], AND grape soda and thus made the BBQ chicken candwich.
