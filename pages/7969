THAN HOW DID AVATAR DO IT?
{{potential}}
'''"THAN HOW DID AVATAR DO IT?"''' is a [[forced meme]] stemming from a 2010 raid 4elementtribe.com, a forum for people who think that Avatar: The Last Airbender is real.

And bending ''is'' real. Because if it isn't real... '''THAN HOW DID AVATAR DO IT?'''

==Airbiscuits==

On August 15 2010, [[B/|/b/]] set its sights on 4ElementTribe.com, a peaceful [[hugbox|gathering place]] for [[DBZ|people who think they actually have fucking superpowers]] like those on the cartoon series [[Avatar]]: The Last Airbender. Board members are able to achieve these lofty goals by dicking around in sandboxes with soda can tops and "Controlling [[shit|chi]]."

The raid grew, with multiple [[trolls|users]] [[spam]]ming the fuck out of the guestbook, forums and the whole 4 Element Tribe in general. The mods drew their banhammers and charged headlong into the melee, bound and determined to protect their [[faggotry|homeland]] at all costs.

==Moan of the Benders==

In the panic, one [[faggot|member of the board]] came up with a brilliant theory and announced it over the site's chatbox. He believed the raid was started by the leader of a rival board that also believed that [[Avatar]] was real, BendingAcademy.webs.com. 

Yes, there's more than one of these places. Kill them with fire!

In short, not only do people [[Realmrsoptimusprime|believe a fucking cartoon is real]], but they can't even agree on how it's real. Faced with such facts, Anon had no choice but to travel to Bending Academy [[for great justice|in an effort to educate them.]]

After about an hour of [[epic win]], the meme was created. (See pic above.)
The 12 year olds follow a creepy guy named [[13 year old boys|Djuan]] who left his phone number up on his myspace so his students could call him and ask him for help with bending because it's [[Serious Business|srs business]]. To their surprise, the raiders were not idiots and were able to find the number, which led the 12 year olds [[internet court|threatening to sue]] every single one of the raiders if they called Djuan.

On August 15, 2010 at 4:22 PM, the 4 Element Tribe forums were [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|purged from the internet]]. Moderator Zengh promised that they would be rebuilt stronger and more secure, but by this time Anon had stopped giving a fuck long ago. [[Last Thursday|The following day]] all topics were cleared and the forum was locked. At that point, no one could post at all. On August 18, 2010 the forums were opened up again when they thought Anon was done. It didn't take long for it to fill up with posts of gore and other troll posts.

On August 16, 2010 the website [[basement dweller|owner]] was forced to make an update addressing [[masturbation|hacking threats]] against 4 Element Tribe's members. 

[[fail|"If you guys are having issues with hacking threats or any other Internet Harassment please vist CyberCrime.Gov"]]

You heard that right, the [[cyberpolice]] are out to get you now.

== Trolling These Kids is as Easy as a Whore ==
