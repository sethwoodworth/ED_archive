Bullying
[[Image:Jerb.gif|thumb|This guy approves of bullying because from a utilitarian [[philosophy]], bullying is completely and utterly acceptable as the needs of the few are outweighed by the needs of the many]]
[[Image:Bully-game.jpg|thumb|Even [[game]]s designers approve.]]
[[Image:No to Bullying3.jpg|thumb|Any attempt to erase something so hard-wired into our nature is inevitably going to [[fail]].]]

'''Bullying''' is the [[lulz]]worthy act of making a [[fool]] out of someone who is more [[exploitable]] than yourself; having fun at their expense. It can be done both [[IRL]] and on the [[internets]], except that on the internets it is known as [[trolling]] unless you've got [[NORP|life]] in which case it is "cyberbullying" or "[[Internet Hate Machine|domestic terrorism]]." Bullying is responsible for making inferior people's lives utterly miserable, and for bringing [[for great justice|great pleasure]] to the [[anonymous|group]] carrying out the bullying. As such it is not only a great way to prove your superiority and fit in with your [[pedophile|peer group]], but you are likely inciting future [[Bill Gates]], Thomas Jeffersons and [[Hitler|Hitlers]] to take out their grudges against mankind by creating such atrocities as [[Windows]], [[democracy]], and [[World War II]].

Bullying has been observed in [[human]] and [[animal]] societies for [[at least 100 years]]. It is suitable for people of all ages, from the [[baby|cradle]] to the [[death|grave]]. It starts before children even enter [[school]], and it still exists in [[adult]] [[work]]places; thank the [[lawd]]. Bullying is known to make people become [[an hero]]es, and as such is a good thing because it allows us to write new pages on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] about them.

==[[IRL]] Bullying==
[[Image:Retardbully.JPG|thumb|right|Oh the [[lulz|horror!]]]]
Bullying [[IRL]] happens everywhere. When you're [[ginger|unpopular]], you become an easy target for those with more [[cool|street smarts]] than you. If you are a [[retard]], an [[asspie]], a [[nigra]], a Jew, an [[azn]], a Arab, [[emo]], [[ginger]], or a [[white]] boy you are likely to become a victim of bullying. Basically, what happens is that you are often to be found [[ronery|alone]] with no one to talk to, and you get [[violence|beaten up]] by gangs of thugs who are stronger than you. They may even [[an|steal your iPod]]. They may call you "Billy no-mates".

[[Sceptre]] is well known to have been bullied. The [[Wikipedia Review]] has documented this well.

{{quote|There's nothing whatever wrong with Sceptre that a little time and increasing [[maturity]] won't fix. He's not to be compared with the usual sort of [[ryulong|admins]] we discuss.|[[Poetlister|guy]]}}
{{quote|He once took a [[wikibreak]] or complained or something because of "bullying" at his school. Being surrounded by [[retard]]s at one's high school all day is not helpful to one becoming more mature or refined.|[[NawlinWiki|LamontStormstar]]}}
{{quote|I remember he shared with me that there was, in fact, a [[YouTube]] video of him being [[pwnt|bullied]] (he asked for it to be taken down).|[[Nathanr|Nathan]]}}
{{quote|What was in the video? What was the story behind it being put on the internet?|LamontStormstar}}
{{quote|I can only recall that he was being physically bullied. It was probably put up by one of the bullies, to ridicule him. I don't remember a lot about it, it was quite a while ago.|Nathan}}
{{quote|I wonder if the people at his school knew about him on Wikipedia.|LamontStormstar}}
{{quote|It's certainly possible.|Nathan}}

==[[Cyber]] Bullying==
[[Image:School bully not so tough.jpg|thumb|[[rape|What]] happens to bullies. Lulz]]
Since we all know that "cyber" is such a [[Web 1.0]] word, the rest of this [[article]] only discusses cyberbullying in the shitty [[police state]] known as the [[UK]], because like other Communist countries they're still catching up with the [[USA]]'s capitalist ways 20 years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Only the British could be so fail that they can't block people or not look for videos of themselves being beat-up.

As described above, [[YouTube]] is an important tool in cyberbullying. [[chav|People]] film fights on their [[mobile phone]]s, then upload them to the site where they will stay for a long, long time because the incompetent [[mods]] cannot do [[shit]] about the videos. Extreme violence in such videos is called "[[gay|happy slapping]]". The people who carry out such things are almost as bad as the people getting bullied, and there needs to be a new [[Holocaust]] for them [[for great justice]] and [[epic]] lulz.

==How to handle being bullied==
*1. [[STFU|Stop whining.]] [[Truth|It only makes their penises harder.]]
*2. Use your aggressive feelings, boy. Let the [[hate]] flow through you! 
*3. Get a [[gun]]. And ammo. Lots of ammo. (I'd go for a 'phased plasma rifle in the 40 Watt range'.)
*4. Face your tormentor and as many of their closest friends as possible. Don't forget to bring [[Gun|your little friend]] along.
*5. Point gun at their faces. 
*6. [[Schizophrenic|Obey them voices!]]
*7. [[Warhammer_40,000|BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD, BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD, BLOOD FOR THE BLOOOOOD GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!]]
*8. [[Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion/Stop_right_there,_criminal_scum!|"STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!"]] (Did you [[Fail|forget]] [[An_Hero|something?]])
*9. Just don't pay attention to it. Seriously, why should you care if some 35-year-old [[basement dweller]] calls you a gay? (Look at it this way: from his point of view, you're [[Sex|getting some]] from the same sex, [[Fact|and that still counts]]. Mister 35-year-old virgin, on the other hand, will never get ANY, from either sex.) You've got [[4chan|better things to do with your time]].
*10. During brief periods of not being bullied, use this [[Shit|expertly crafted]] flash game to practice your anti-cyberbullying skillzes. http://www.mcgruff.org/Games/cyberbully.php
