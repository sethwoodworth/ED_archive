[[Image:Laptop-wp80.jpg|thumb|WhatPort80's website arrangement really makes you wonder what you've been smoking.]]

'''Whatport80''' is what ED should have done before running out of money and is for [[censorship|safe and sound]] [[internet]] [[sex|fun times]]. The [[wiki]] is designed to document and catalogue internet [[meme]]s and happenings and is [[TOW|dedicated to displaying them in an environment suitable]] for [[virgin|adults]], [[13 year old boy|children]], [[basement dweller|the internet savvy]], and [[newbie|internet noobs]] ([[b|and everybody in between]]). The site maintains [[an]] [[SFW]] attitude so that maybe you can show memes to your boss or [[your mom|mom]] and not get [[pwned|sacked or disowned by your family]].

Oh, did we mention the [[Faggot|pretty colors]]?

==On the Origins of WhatPort80==
Encyclopedia Dramatica - like all websites dedicated to trolling and drama - faces a deductive problem:

#ED is a wiki made by assholes.
#Fans of ED are assholes.
#Fans do not donate to ED because they are assholes.

In short ED is desperately short of cash and due to its infamous reputation (the reputation which made it so popular in the first place) no self-respecting site would advertise here. Thus, WhatPort80 was made. Below is an [[lie|easy to understand]] diagram that [[bullshit|explains the relationship between ED and the new WhatPort80.]]

On a Web server or Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon, '''port 80''' is the port that the server "listens to" or expects to receive from a Web client, assuming that the default was taken when the server was configured or set up. A port can be specified in the range from 0-[[over 9000|65536]] on the NCSA server. However, the server administrator configures the server so that only one port number can be recognized. By default, the port number for a Web server is 80. Experimental services may sometimes be run at port 8080 ... zzzzzzzzzz.

WhatPort80 is [[lie|nothing like]] [[ED]]. Here are some quotes about [[Twilight]] to illustrate the point.

==The WhatPort Wars==

Obviously for the remaining minutes of [[ED]]'s life before it gets [[pwn]]d by [[money|The Man]], an endless supply of [[lulz]] will be generated by the attitude of [[Internet Tough Guy|hardcore]] [[gay|ED user]]s to [[christian|WhatPort]]'s crispy [[islam|All-American]] freshness. Nothing shows the true spirit of rebellion than posting [[dong]]s all over [[Girlvinyl]]'s userpage and calling her a [[scientology|money-grubbing]] [[win|slut]]. It's almost as good as listening to [[Star Wars]] fans arguing about [[HAN SHOT FIRST!|who shot who first in the Cantina on Tatooine]].
