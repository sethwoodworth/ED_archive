'''l0de''' ''(aka Horace Dix)'' is creator and host of the ''l0de radio hour'', an extremely popular (if 5 listeners was popular) podcast for trolls. l0de's circle down the drain of failure came when he began to spam his podcast on numerous IRC servers.

==l0de the Person==

After a short-lived tour of duty in the Air Force, where he was kicked out for stealing a hot dog at K-Mart, l0de lived in [[New Orleans]] and worked as a bellboy at a hotel called Olivier House in the French Quarter and as part of his employment got a free room. He spent all of his little money on radio equipment for a silly radio show which he advertized on GNAA. On numerous occasions people have asked l0de why he doesn't own a car to [[GTFO|get the fuck out]] of NOLA, or maybe have a real job that doesn't just pay room and board.

==l0de the p0wnede==

Because l0de decided to spend all of his money on radio equipment so he could call former GNAA member [[User:JiZZy|JiZZy]] a [[faggot]] in retaliation for numerous ruinings, l0de had no car. As a result of his own stupidity, l0de was forced to stay in New Orleans all the way through [[Hurricane Katrina]]. JiZZy called the hotel at 7 AM that morning and spoke to l0de asking for a reservation. L0de at first confirmed this happened, then tried to deny it. 

Many people ask l0de about the weather in Katrina or ask about a survival story from the storm. Three quarters of the time, l0de parts the chat or quits the IRC server entirely, then goes about his work of spamming his "radio show". 

Rumor is that l0de has since moved to Jew York where he is now a test anus for a new Japanese owned sex toy company. He sold all his LRH equipment to afford a studio apartment above a K-Ma

The l0de Radio Hour was held friday night at midnight and would last at least an hour. L0de would wait for people to call in every once in a while, and he played various MP3's and responded vocally to things said in #GNAA. Problems arose when more and more weeks passed between episodes and the quality started going way down. Additionally, he would not share on his website the episodes and parts of his show which were the most [[lulz]] and hoarded them away like he was going to sell them or something.

He would rant for hours about the [[pwnage|mongrelization]] of society by [[happy negro|black semen]] and ovening Jews with a solar-powered Jewburner, which is all well and good, but when it came to issues of how he kept hanging up on callers accidentally every fucking time he'd try to answer the phone, he would whine and bitch and get [[GNAA]] members G-lined for pointing out his gross technical ineptitude. 

L0de is a tumbling, bumbling, stumbling, goblin kike failure who cannot figure out how to use his own radio show equipment and privately messages [[User:JiZZy|hecklers]] on irc to stop ruining his radio show with taunts. 

Because l0de cannot handle a live audience of trolls and radio equipment with lots of knobs, buttons, and sliders, it has been suggested that l0de consider something a bit easier to use, like [[podcasting]]. That way, when he answers the phone and somebody calls him a [[Jews|cantankerous Jew]], he can go back and edit that part out.

== The Last Broadcast == 
After his girlfriend broke up with him, l0de had an all-time high audience when he announced he would be taking votes on whether or not he should [[an hero|commit suicide]] or become a [[homosexual]]. After many hours of drinking cheap wine and playing david bowie songs, the count finally came in, and gay had edged death by a mere few pity votes.. but not before being trolled thoroughly by random [[lusers|losers]].


'''Update:''' l0de did a  show on the infamous Partyvan FM Prank stream. It was full of lulz and attention whoring.

== l0de Of The Now ==
