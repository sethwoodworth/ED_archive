Kamunou Hyena
Kamunou is yet another [[emo]] hyena black person[[furry]] [[lol-cow]].  His pasty cracker exterior fills him with self-loathing, and as a result, he self-injures while listening to Disturbed and System of a Down. Negative attention whores like this are easy prey because they never stop replying.

==Yiffing furfags==
[[Image:Furry_heart.jpg|thumb|left|A match made in heaven.]]
[[Image:Kamunou-anim.gif|thumb|right|A few of his many lol camwhore shots.]]
The drama with his ex- is the result of an addiction to Kamunou's "[http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/112262.html tiny, rough]" cock, and the clingy drama that resulted when their e-relationship became about nothing more than sex. [[Yiff|Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex]].  He constantly bitches about being trolled because of the resulting drama, while cross-posting it to any forum that hasn't yet [[Ban|banned]] hi'''(Deleted post)'''

[http://kamunouhyena.livejournal.com/78033.html For example]!

"You are still a sexually driven fucker, you seem to forget about the posts that you made where you were bragging about getting buttsecks from that faggoty ass dragon."

===Pedofur bait===
Their yiffiness approached such epic levels that [[cock]] pix can be found all over the various chan boards and YouTube. The ex-, a notorious [[babyfur]], was banned from LJ when [[LJ Abuse]] found his underage cock pictures.

=="Furries ACCEPT people."==
[[Anthrocon]] '06 apparently opened Kamunou's eyes to the ONE TRUE FURRY WAY, so he proceeded to rant about how half of the fandom -- namely, the half he isn't a part of -- isn't "real," and consists of what he calls "psudofurries," only interested in porn and FChan.  He also described "real furries" as completely accepting of people and their disgusting kinks and fetishes.

About half of {{ljcomm|user=anthrocon}} fursecuted him on the spot to show how accepting they were of his intolerance. After the trolls had their way with him, he committed thread [[suicide]], though a copy of the post can be found [http://kamunouhyena.livejournal.com/57043.html here]. IT NEVER REALLY HAPPENED GUYS

==YTMND==
Another way Kamunou follows 'the furry tao' is by creating [[YTMND]]s.  They are generally mocked because 1) he is a furry; 2) every time someone has an opinion contrary to his own, he goes [[Blackwingdragon]]-nuts with [http://ytmnd.com/sites/profile/505995 emo-rage and e-threats].

[[The Internet Is Serious Business|The internet is serious fucking business]].  His reaction stems from [[cutter]] angst.

==I'm an [[emo]] kid==
[[Image:SLybersex.jpg|thumb|right|Kamunou is apparently very fond of virtual yiffing.]]
"You can f*cking suck my ass, you f*ggot. Last thing I am is a f*cking emo."

He really hates being called "emo."  It sends him flying into an emo rage that can only be quelled by listening to emo music while taking [[Fat girl angle shot|MySpace angle pictures]], posting them on his el-jay, and [[Bisexual|smoking cock]].

===[[Internet tough guy]] threats===
[http://ytmnd.com/sites/profile/505995 "And for the record, I USED to slit my wrists, every f*cking day back when I was fourteen. But I realized something. Life is worth living, despite the *ssholeS who constantly come in and try to f*ck it up. If you think you're getting me emo over this sh*t, you're doing just the opposite. I'm filled with f*cking RAGE, and I want nothing more than to slit your f*cking throat in five different places, rip your f*cking cock off, and mutilate your body until it's nothing but bloody ribbons."]

[http://ytmnd.com/sites/profile/505995 "And if you ever... EVER associate me with that mother f*cking whiney Emo Anthem again, I'll get you back. OH YES, I WELL f*ckING GET YOUR *ss BACK FOR THAT sh*t."]

[[Image:OMGIYIFFU.jpg|thumb|right|What the cock is this shit?]]
[http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/95286.html After the trolls ran with the lulz], he tried to [[troll|anti-troll]] the very community he actively posts and comments in.  Some of his amusing and typical responses included:

*U GOT [[NO LIFE]]!
*I'm going to be a bigger man and stop replying!
*I [[did it for the lulz]].
*This is all very amusing to me, please continue!
*[[Attention whore|I love all this attention!  Worship me!]]

Kamunou is such an upstanding furry that even [[Mix_Hyena|Mix Hyenataur]] [http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/95286.html?thread=2269750#t2269750 disassociates with him].

As an [[attention whore]], he'll no doubt love this ED entry.

==His furry tao==

*[http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/95286.html?thread=2832950 "Well, that just goes to show you that I have more of a life than you, who's obviously bored out of you're mind 24/7 and has nothing to do but talk down to people. And if that's what you want in your life, more power to you, but it's really quite pathetic. I'm done with this, you're a waste of my time."] (#2)

*[http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/95286.html?thread=2834998 "Oh hoh. First of all, I keep replying because this entire thread is mainly about me. Which I'm totally flattered over, seeing as I've totally just triggered a bunch of trolls to totally do what they do best."]

*[http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/95286.html?thread=2846006 "This entire COMMUNITY is a mistake, but the people in it are too full of themselves to admit to that."]

*[http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/95286.html?thread=2848566 "The bottom line of this is that this entire community is full of hatred and idiots who focus on the horrible things in their lives and laugh at other people's mistakes. And you're one of the people that support it. And yes, this community is fucking sad. The only reason I'm posting in it is because you bring me OH SO MUCH amusement. Faith... in humanity... deminishing... HEHEHE It's like a drug!"]

*[http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/95286.html?thread=2851126 "And as for you not having a life? Well, you really don't, obviously. But you do have a good point. Neither do I though, so I won't bring it up again."]

*[http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/95286.html?thread=2854454 "I'm seriously done with this, now, I have shit to do. Oh hoh, I can see it coming. "OHH WE SO BEAT HIM!!! I BET UR GONNA GO CRY AND SLIT UR WRITSTS!!!" Hehehehehe. In all honesty I don't give a shit what you say about me, if you haven't already determined that at this point. Which you probably haven't, but JUST TO LET YOU KNOW. Bye bye, friend. <3<"] (#3)

*[http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/95286.html?thread=2854966 "Don't care. I've had my fun. I'm GOING NOW. ^_________^"] (#4)

==I'M IN UR WIKI, BLANKING UR PAGES==
Like most aspiring drama-llamas, Kamunou [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Kamunou_Hyena&oldid=1997004963 tried to delete the evidence] of his douchebaggery, failing to realize that revert wars only increase the lulz.

[http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/95286.html?thread=2868022#t2868022 "You don't get how easy it is to select all and delete all that hard work of yours. And by the way, I'm currently making one for YOU :D  Awww, I got banned from that place. I'm gonna go cry now."]

Somebody is apparently unclear on the concept of wikis.

==N00dz==
Available on request.  Both [[Jakerz]] and Kamunou couldn't get enough of the internet attention, so they posted fugly nudes all over the various chan image boards and {{ljcomm|user=drama_awesome}}, and MySpace angle [[emo]] videos.  When Kamunou could no longer pretend to care about the drama, he finally [[Deleting your LiveJournal|committed LJ furicide]], declaring everyone involved to be "really immature."
