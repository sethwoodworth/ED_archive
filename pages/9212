Xkcd
__NOTOC__

[[Image:12320913612.jpg|right|thumb|right|All you need to know. Also, some hearts.]]

'''[http://www.xkcd.com xkcd]''', pronounced \eks-kud\, is the home of a [[mspaint|stick-figure]] [[webcomic]] produced by /[[r9k/]]-inspiring physics geek and [[slashdot]] [[fanboy]] Randall Patrick Munroe. Dubbed by the author "a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language", the comic was once a source of kinda funny, geek-inspired humor, but has recently become a tri-weekly outlet for Munroe to write about the [[snca|latest happenings in his love life through poorly drawn stick figures]].

==What's in an xkcd [[lulz killer|comic?]]==

:* Randall claiming that he is [[unwarranted self-importance|better than you]] because he knows of a certain mathematical/science theory he read about on [[Wikipedia]].
:* Randall claiming he is better than you because he <s>has</s> had a [[slut|girlfriend]].
:* Randall insisting on perpetuating an image of the fantasy world he lives in where girls actually give a fuck about things like [[Linux]].
:* [[LOL INTERNET]] [[Meme|MEMES]] AND [[nerd|NERD-CULTURE]].
:* [[Richard Stallman]].
:* Visual representations of various [[fail|inferiority complexes]].

Rest of the comics are confusing graphs and formul[[æ]]. It is important to note that the addition of any actual humor is entirely optional and largely irrelevant.

==tl;dr==

''xkcd'' is a prime example of the idea that if you can't make a funny comic, you can at least shamelessly appeal to the interests of your fanbase, which consists of pasty-faced [[liberal]] [[basement-dwellers]] and [[Math|mathophiles]]. Long devoid of anything resembling humor, ''xkcd'' instead relies on its pseudo-intelligence to mask its lack of [[funny]]. So when a comic is made up and Munroe realizes it's a pile of dogshit, the problem is circumvented by putting the comic under a radical sign, or drawing a couple hearts on it, or throwing in a bunch of shit about computer [[programming]], so that the legions of nerdy [[Fanboy|fans]] will have something to relate to. Any attempt to expose this for what it is (a [[circlejerk]] of unfunny nerds basking in their own pseudo-intellectualism) will result in the classic [[fail]]ed rebuttal, "''xkcd'' is too intelligent for you. You just don't get the subtle humor and intricate jokes."

Here is some of that great, biting humor now. Remember, this is in no way [[pretentious]]; it's sophisticated humor that you'll just never understand.

Quality humor, [[No|right]]?

==xkcd fans: [[do not want]]==

===[[Digg]]===
As previously stated, ''xkcd'' is the subject of rampant [[fanboy|fanboyism]], especially in the [[Digg]] Community where [[Over_9000|thousands]] of [[basement-dwellers]] wait up every night to be the first to submit the comic in a pathetic attempt to gain 15 minutes of [[Paris_hilton|parasitic]] [[Internet_fame|internets fame]], followed by [http://digg.com/users/binky79 binky79] and his [[samefag|impostors]] claiming that "[[THE BEST|This is the best xkcd ever!]]"

==Early Works==

While it seems that [[nothing|little]] of his current work is funny, the truth of the matter is that  Munroe simply peaked early in his career.  His earliest sketches were vastly superior in whimsy and humor to his current work, but soon fell into a downward spiral of [[pretentious|pretense]] and [[fail|failure]] when he started sketching [[slut|girls]] [[almost_raped|sleeping in front of him]], because Randall Munroe is just [[Perma-virgin|that type of guy]].  While there is only one documented victim in Munroe's notebook [[art|rape]] spree, there are undoubtedly thousands of [[fan_art|pictures]] just like this:

[[Image:Girl_sleeping_noline_(1).jpg‎|center|thumb|400px|Sleepy girl is sleepy.]]

He also likes [[Questionable_content|Questionable Content]], btw.

==xkcd and the Internet==
The thing for which Munroe is perhaps most famous is not his chronically un-amusing math "humor", chronically un-amusing relationship "humor," or insistence on clumsily cramming his comics full of other unfunny nerd shit, but his absurd amounts of internet pandering. That's right, ''xkcd''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s creator is [[I am aware of all internet traditions|aware of the internet]], and apparently wants to make very damn sure everyone knows it. And since ''xkcd''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s creator obviously [[No life|spends as much time online]] as his pathetically devoted fanbase, you can correctly assume that most of the comics will find a way to cram in some unnecessary reference to a popular website or software or stupid [[meme]] of which he's just learned. Even for a webcomic, ''xkcd'' contains a great amount of stupid, shameless, and useless internet references, which incidentally, makes it uncannily similar and of interest to [[ED]]. Some of the [[Not Internet Relevant|internet-related]] issues of ''xkcd'':

*[http://xkcd.com/77/] - [[LiveJournal]]
*[http://xkcd.com/94/] - [[AIM]]
*[http://xkcd.com/111/] - [[Firefox]]
*[http://xkcd.com/446/] - [[In popular culture]]
*[http://xkcd.com/456/] - [[Linux]]
*[http://xkcd.com/461/] - [[Google]] Maps
*[http://xkcd.com/464/] - [[Bel-Air]]
*[http://xkcd.com/466/] - Internet Connections
*[http://xkcd.com/467/] - [[2girls1cup]]
*[http://xkcd.com/481/] - [[YouTube]] - This one actually spawned [[Youtube#Comment Audio Preview|YouTube's audio preview]] for comments.
*[http://xkcd.com/488/] - [[DRM]]<br>
*[http://xkcd.com/512/] - [[Image macros]]
*[http://xkcd.com/524/] - [[Rickroll]]
*[http://xkcd.com/318/] - Even [[Goatse]]

...and just about half of all new comics, for that matter.

Unfortunately for Munroe, merely referencing something funny or relevant, such as an internet meme, does not make you funny or relevant yourself. It just puts you on the same level as the average stupid [[13 year old boy|teenage boy]] endlessly parroting ''[[Borat]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'' quotes, assuredly [[Rape|raping]] any inherent comedic value the jokes may have once had.

==xkcd and ED==
[[At least 100]] years ago, Munroe made a comic giving the xkcd version of that [[rickroll|Boom de Yada]] song from [[hipster|The Discovery Channel]]. Some [[btard]] who has [[basement dweller|a permanent cathode-ray tan]] created his own version. [[Anonymous]] was [[limecat|not impressed]]:

[[Image:Disc4chan.png|Some /b/tard salutes his [[life]].]]

===Online Map===
Last Thursday Munroe made a map of popular internet communities. It would have probably been kind of cool if it hadn't [[Slowpoke|already been done several times]]. Also, [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] wasn't mentioned, to which some [[butthurt]] EDiots took offense. One even went as far as to [[Trying too hard|make his own map]], seen below.

===The Secretary of the Internet===
Last [[Last Thursday|Monday]], ''xkcd'' released a comic about a fictional plan to propose an official [[Final Boss of the Internet|Secretary of the Internet]]. The comic turned out to be multipartite, with consecutive episodes coming out in the following days. Surprisingly, the usual math/science/relationship faggotry took a back seat to a bunch of [[Uncyclopedia|stupid nonsense]] about internet [[troll]]s and [[Ron Paul]]. It's all drawn out over multiple comics to make it seem more [[EPIC]] and interesting, but there's really nothing funny about it. However, one interesting part about it is the name-dropping of [[4chan]]'s [[b|/b/]] in the second part, and subsequent [[Rage|enraging]] of [[newfag|stupid faggots]] from /b/ who predictably made furious cries regarding [[Rules 1 & 2]]. It would have been quite awesome if Randall Munroe was just trying to troll the fuck out of /b/tards, but the more likely scenario is just another case of trying to parasitically latch on to a popular internet community to pander to his stupid fans.

===ROBOT9000===
In early 2008, Munroe made a post on his [[blog]] about a new [[bot]] that he'd developed, which he named [[R9gay|ROBOT9000]]. The function of the bot was to cancel out noise in [[chat]] by making it so that a post could never be duplicated. A novel concept, the bot was soon put to work on [[4chan]] as the primary moderator of the then-new board /[[r9k]]/. Munroe promptly [[I CAME|orgasmed]] upon hearing this news and [http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/ updated his blog accordingly]. While the bot first showed signs of promise as a useful idiot-filter, it was soon revealed that if you take the [[desu|repetition]], [[spam]], and [[retard|idiocy]] out of 4chan, you're only left with a bunch of [[aspie]]s having boring arguments over topics they know nothing about and shitloads of [[LiveJournal]]-esque relationship whining; which is precisely what /r9k/ has become, [[Irony|ironically]] mirroring the devolution of the ''xkcd'' comics themselves.

===YouTube Audio Preview===
Randall Munroe was also indirectly responsible for [[YouTube]]'s shitty, useless audio comment preview system. In October '08, Munroe made a rare decent comic about how YouTube commenters are among the dumbest people on the internet, and the comic proposed a hypothetical audio playback system to show the YT users just how amazingly stupid they are. Oddly enough, shortly after the comic aired YouTube installed a similar system that allows users to play audio previews of their comments before posting. Of course, this idea should have stayed in the realm of "Haha, what if?" because it's completely fucking [[fail|useless]] in practice, since users can simply choose to ''[[NO U|not use]]'' the system altogether.

==Trolling the xkcd forums==
Trolling the xkcd forums is a subtle and unknown art, many have tried but few have actually succeed, due to aspie mod team constantly watching the reported posts.
:'''Known trolling techniques'''
:*Mention rape being funny, or that she was totally asking for it
:*Bring up Evo-Psych
:*Mention anything about "Terriorsts, next 200 feet"
:*Constantly post conservative propaganda
:*Apply to join the truly free and spam goatse in Free as In Destitute. Point out the hypocrisy as the mods clean up your dirty work.
:*Go to the mafia sub-forums and mention anything about ALICE still searching or Babam being the best mafia mod ever.
:*Use red text, it pisses off the mods because ORIGINAL COLOR DO NOT STEAL
:*Talk about piracy or emulation in the gaming forums
:*Ask what davaen actually does
:*Post rambling bullshit in the mathematics forum claiming you've solved P=NP
:*Link to last measure
:*Fun Fact: You can embed infectious .swfs with the [flash][/flash] tags
:*Start flame wars in the News and Articles section, very easy to do.
:*Post as many new comic threads at midnight EST, get butthurt and flame the other thread if it gets picked by the mods
:*Post anything at all in Serious Business that is even remotely conservative.
:*For instant lulz, ask Belial about his time with bubba after getting caught with dyke jailbait nessie. Leads to insta-ban.
