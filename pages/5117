[[Image:Time facepalm.jpg|thumb|left|Kinda [[facepalm]] but, in its defence, it '''is''' [[original content]].]]
The '''[http://www.Magmypic.com Magazine Generator]''' is a [[crap|hoary]] [[old meme]] that is currently making a [[retro|comeback]] on [[B|/b/]] 'thanks' -in part- to [[newfags]] who <s>prolly</s> probably weren't born when this [[meme]] died the first time. As such, it even constitutes the all too rare [[original content]] that [[4chan]] has been missing since [[Caturday Nap]].  

It has obvious similarities with the glut of [[Demotivators]] that currently account for at least 75% of all [[B|/b/]] image content, but the Magazine Generator is whey less inspired -thanks, in part, to the generator site's limited capacity for [[lulz|creativity]] when making a cover since you can't fuck with the magazine captions ([[PROTIP]]: [[shoop]] your pic first).

Howevar, even though it's predominantly [[FAIL]], it is [[WIN]] simply for the fact that it at least   encourages wannabe [[B|/b/tards]] to actually 'think' about what they're posting (see: [[SFW Porn]] vs. [[Roll Call]]). Now, if only the [[newfags]] could figure out the choicest pix to upload given the parameters of the generator. Consider it to be the Internets equivalent to [[faggotry|training wheels on a kid's bike]].

===[[PROTIP]]S===
[[Image:Trolling_magmypic.jpg|right|thumb|Make sure you check the box to let others view and vote on this magazine!]]
Just find a lulzy fucking pic [[relevant to]] the mag's interests. [[ED]] is full of them!
[[MagMyPic]] currently supports images '''5MB or less in size. Images larger than this must be resized prior to upload'''. Otherwise, see this article's [[Talk:MagMyPic|Talk page]] for [[Oh Exploitable|Sky = Limit]] ammo.

===[[Trolling]] MagMyPic===

Despite the usual site [[TOS]] bullshit ("May not contain nudity, violent or offensive material..etc") that [[noone]] ever enforces, uploading [[Goatse]] -which is filenamed '''hello.jpg'''- was initially [[:Image:MagMyHello.jpg|successful]], howevar, since all created covers can be viewed and voted on if the troll checks a box of consent, MagMyPic  [[b&]] [[Goatse]] after users complained using a '[[911|report bad content]]' feature.
 
It was uncertain if MagMyPic had some nifty [[SFW|man-ass detection software]] since subsequent attempts [[failed it]] but further research found that '''ANY IMAGE''' named or renamed '''hello.jpg''' resulted in failed image creation. This is obviously because [[B|/b/tards]] spent over 9000 hours [[last Thursday]] trying to create [[Goatse]] covers of all sorts for the MagMyPic [[fan]]s to rate in their [[NORP]] [http://www.magmypic.com/recent gallery of FAIL].

This is also ideal for the [[newfag]] to [[post|sew]] his or her [[lulz|oats]] without looking like the complete [[failtards]] they are since -as discussed- it's almost impossible to [[fail it]] at '''Magazine Generator.''' Most of these [[newfag]] efforts are [[FAIL]] though.
