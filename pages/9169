Wtp
'''WTP''' is a commonly used [[0-day]] variation of the phrase "[[WTF]]?!?!" among [[homosexuals]]. However, it is infinitely cooler than [[wtf]] because it uses a phrase from [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] series, "What the photon?"  

Because [[wtf]] is incredibly overused and appears on several [[wishlist]]s, this new term should most definitely take its place, though caution is needed because of infectious [[diarrhea]] that is believed to breed in wtp-organisms. As a matter of fact anyone using it should immediately roll into an [[MRI]] and their [[kkk membership]] should be revoked.
Nietzsche once declared: "For every [[fat girl angle shot]], [[God]] kills a photon". The reliability of the aforementioned statement is doubtful since Nietzsche was already in his [[emo]] phase at that [[time]]. [[NAMBLA]] researchers believe it was "For every [[complete rewrite]]" but it had been changed by a hippo with [[AIDS]] for [[verisimilitude]].

== The Origin ==
