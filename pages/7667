Somey

'''Somey''' is the 4th king of Wikipedia Review, following his assassination of the 2nd king [[Blissyu2]] in a bloody coup on the 5th of November 2007.  There actually was no 3rd king, as the 3rd was Queen [[Mistress Selina Kyle]], who actually was never really Queen in the first place, but anytime that Blissyu2 wasn't watching she pretended to be queen, only to claim she was only joking.  Somey claims that there was no assassination, that it didn't happen, and that he bought it legitimately in a bloodless coup from the rightful Queen, Selina.

Blissyu2 claims that Selina and Somey are the same person.

Somey also claims that Wikipedia Review was never hosted by [[GoDaddy]] or [[Lunarpages]], and has explained away the bills that Blissyu2 received by showing photos of kittens and laughing about it.  This is apparently good enough explanation for the average Reviewer, who is quite happy to believe a funny photo of a kitten in preference to wading through 200 pages worth of e-mails, the first line of which says "Welcome to GoDaddy!  We hope that you are happy with us as hosts of your site at www.wikipediareview.com, Blissyu2".  [[TL;DR]] = kittens win!  

Somey also explains away screen shots of conversations with hosts by showing photos of kittens and various cutesy stuff.  He explains away Somey himself admitting to hacking Blissyu2's account, thousands of pages of people saying Blissyu2 was the owner, including [[Jimbo Wales]], [[Larry Sanger]] and [[SlimVirgin]] and universal acceptance by all concerned that, as at November 2007, Blissyu2 was in fact the owner by simply not answering it.

Somey likes to not answer things.  If he had to answer such tough questions, he would have to lie.  Poor Somey doesn't like to have to lie.  He prefers kittens.

When not refusing to answer things, Somey is busy deleting hundreds of posts that incriminate him in any way or prove that in actual fact he is wrong.

In July 2008 Somey got caught with his pants down once again, this time because he was caught spying on his own members, doing the dirty work for Daniel Brandt in spying on Newyorkbrad, the head of Wikipedia's arbitration committee.  This really sucked for [[Poetlister]], who was hoping that he would help to get all of her [[sock puppet]]s unbanned by showing her fake [[tit]]s to him.  

Once again, when caught spying, Somey simply said "Those screen shots are faked.  Jorge is lying".

Somey subsequently deleted a buttload of stuff, disabled the Wikipedia Review wiki, blog and anti-cabal forum, banned Jorge, and then insisted that really there was no evidence.

Of course, there comes a point where denying has to end.  So Somey confessed, sort of, to it.  "There may be some truth to it".  But not before it was fluffy kitten time!

Somey proved himself to be "the man" when he launched his own investigation as to (shock, horror) whether Poetlister really was using all of those sock puppets, in '''August 2008'''.  Not in September 2007 when ED proved it.  Indeed, it wasn't even because suddenly Poetlister is deleting all of Guy's posts (indeed, Somey still expressed shock that Guy and Poetlister were really the same person), or that after they both quit suddenly Taxwoman returned.  The actual reason was because of an anonymous tip off that led to that 2006 help desk post on Wikipedia.  Yes, that is Somey in action.

There is the holocaust, there is holocaust denial, there are holocaust denial deniers like [[Alex Linder]], there are holocaust denial denier deniers, like founder of Wikipedia Review Igor Alexander, who was accused by SlimVirgin and [[Grace Note]] of being Alex Linder, and then there is Somey.  

Somey denies everything.  Why, if Somey doesn't like you, he will deny your very existence.

Somey knows how to read people too.  He knows that with enough fluffy kittens, control of what can be deleted and edited, and convincing people that reading 1 line counts as [[TL;DR]] that he can control what people think.  

Somey has actually been accused of being a Nazi, also by Grace Note.

[[Conti]] really hates him and has been waging a long-running e-war against him.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_Review&diff=prev&oldid=240283839]

Incidentally, if anyone is interested Somey is a 46 year old living in the Midwest. Any resemblance to a teenage basement-dwelling California geek is entirely Somey's act.
