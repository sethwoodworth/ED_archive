Part of [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/]], this [[meme]] originated in [[4chan]]'s [[B|/b/]]. '''You Laugh, You Lose''' [[thread]]s are what posters with no sense of [[lulz]] like to start.

In these threads, [[gaiafag]]s prove their massive virginity skillz by reposting as many played-out [[image macro]]s, [[memes]], and other retarded images/[[copypasta]] as possible. [[Oldfags]] will frequent these contests, [[Unwarranted self importance|but only to claim that everyone else is posting old memes]]. The idea is for people who still have a sense of humour to post funny([[Truth|Mostly un-funny]]) images while oldfags [[BAWWWW]] at everyone else for posting old memes. Because everyone knows that 4chan oldfags,[[Truth|the worst oldfags]], really have nothing better to do then show off their e-peen by accusing others of posting old memes. Then when called out on such faggotry they will post a Umad??? picture, to imply that they trolled the other person, when in reality they all get trolled by the [[party van]].

Sound confusing? Stay off 4chan. [[Truth|You won't regret it]].

==Origins==

[[Some argue|Many claim]] that You Laugh, You Lose threads used to be entirely different from what they are today.  The idea being that you or somebody else posts an image that is seriously offensive. Anyone that laughs at the posted image, loses.  Anyone who laughs is [[b|no longer considered a functioning member of society]] and therefore loses.  I suppose anyone who laughs at these threads is still no longer a functioning member of society, so not much has changed really.

==Variations==

* [[You Bawww, You Lose]].
* "You [[Rage]], You Lose".  This is [[V/|/v/]]'s variant of these. They contain just as much fail.
* "You [[Fap]], You Lose".  When a [[asking for it|sexually suggestive]] picture is posted in a new thread.  When the [[OP]] posts [[trap|traps]] you really [[fail|lose]] when fapping to that.  Since /b/ is full of [[closet]] cases this isn't uncommon though
* "You [[Wat]], You Lose".  
* "You Save, You Lose".  These threads were/are an attempt to dreg [[win]] from the ocean of piss.  As opposed to the [[cancer|intellectual bankruptcy]] that typify "You Laugh, You Lose" threads, or the usual attempted [[spam|reanimation]] of some [[old meme|dead shit]] that was [[advice dog|never funny to begin with]], "You save, you lose" threads were/are more akin to a mashup of [[pix|/hr/]], [[photography|/p/]] & [[wallpaper|/wg/]].  [[Fantasy]]/[[robot|sci-fi]]/futuristic images are popular [[nerds|for some reason]], but you will occasionally find epic hi-res [[art|artwork]], or [[LA|cityscapes]] as well.
* "You Fall in Love, You Lose". Probably one of the most [[retarded]] variations. People have to post [[fugly|hot]] chicks, and if you fall in love you lose it. Closely [[incest|related]] to "You Fap, You Lose", only with more [[fail]].
* "You Barf, You Lose". Definitely one of the [[Fail|THE BEST]] variations of this. People post pictures of [[Kittens|cute]], [[Pain series|lovable]] things. People who are overly [[Offended|disgusted]] lose.

== Difficulty Levels ==
In an attempt to mix up You Laugh, You Lose threads, sometimes the OP will state difficulty levels.  <s>In general the higher or lower difficulty the less funny the thread is.</s> Disregard that, they are all fucking the same.
