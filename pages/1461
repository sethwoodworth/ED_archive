==WTF's happened to Keanu?==

:The joke was that [[sad | Keanu]] is immortal and takes on new identities, often having been many famous historical figures. Sometimes it's said he is simply a "Man from Earth"-style immortal, sometimes he is a vampire or sucks the life-force out of those around him. In relation to this, his tragic life history was occasionally brought up. Recently (in the past week) the photos of Keanu eating on a bench alone and looking depressed and it caused Anon to feel sympathy for him. When some pointed out his tragic history - his father was a manual laborer who left when he was three, his mother dated around leaving Keanu to be mostly raised by relatives, although he was a promising hockey player an injury kept him from playing competitively, he moved around a lot (attending 4 high schools in 5 years) and didn't make many friends, he had to quit acting school because he was broke, his best friend River Phoenix overdosed and died, Keanu has expressed many times his genuine desire to have a family but when his GF Jennifer Symes became pregnant the baby was born dead, she then suffered extreme post-partum depression that broke up their romantic relationship although they remained close friends, later she committed suicide by car, a paparazzo claiming Symes had hit him unsuccessfully sued Keanu for 1.5 years (Keanu won), Keanu's sister got cancer and he's spent millions keeping her alive, and finally the whole world shits on him for being stupid and a bad actor - Anon began to feel they could relate to him and came up with Cheer Up Keanu Day on June 15th. All the recent threads have either been promoting Cheer Up Keanu Day, spreading the sad story, making sad Keanu verticals, or other stuff like the mixtape...

Thus, the truly sad tale of Keanu's life frought with [[Lost|loss]] and hardship began making the rounds on [[B|/b/]], [[tv/|/tv/]], [[a/|/a/]], and just about everywhere else on the [[NORP|norp]] side of the [[interbutts]] (including [[Facebook]]).  It didn't take long for a movement to be created to cheer up the [[emo|melancholy]] celeb...

After the [[lonely]] looking star of ''[[The Matrix]]'' began making the rounds on the [[internets]], June 15th, [[2010]], was marked as [http://t3chh3lp.com/blog/facebook-event-june-15th-cheer-up-keanu-day.html ''Cheer Up Keanu Day''] and the [[fantards]] created a [http://www.facebook.com/#!/event.php?eid=125104887512396 Facebook group], with the goal of organizing mass-mailings of letters and gifts to the saddened celeb.  This is touching, although how anyone actually plans to accomplish anything tangible with this is a fucking [[mystery]], since Keanu will most likely be indifferent to such [[unrealistic expectations|trite, worldly efforts]] to change his [[an hero|eternal somber mood]].  He's probably dealt with enough fan bullshit already at this point, dontchathink?  [[Meh]].

Despite what you'd normally expect about such a [[fanboi]]-spawned event attracting [[troll]]s like flies to [[shit]], so far it seems to be proving remarkably [[faggotry]]-free (most likely due to the fact that newfags are too young to have seen any of his movies) , with even the [[basement dwellers]] on [[*chan]] taking particular interest in the event, and in Keanu.  

===Why Now?===
Keanu is, after all, a [[Buddhist]].  And although no one is arguing that Keanu hasn't had real [[money|success]] in his life, after a long career of occasional artistic hit-and-misses, and an obviously troubled personal life, he seems to be questioning the realities of exactly [[hookers and blow|what "success" ''is'']].  He's probably gotten tired of listening to every Jew studio exec demand he [[sell out|sell-out]] and make another [[Michael Bay|shitty summer blockbuster]], or other [[douche-bag]] celebrities he knows whining about how much it costs to insure their [[Ferrari]] while he's spending millions to save his sister dying from fucking [[cancer]] in the hospital.  So, unlike vacuous [[new age]] [[yuppie]] [[hipster]] faggots who claim they're oh-so-enlightened and sticking it to [[The Man]] because they [[recycle]] and [[I don't watch TV|don't watch TV]], Keanu's indifference and apathy is due to actually having ''had'' real loss in his life, and has learned from it the hard way.  So since [[EMO|we've all been a Keanu at one time]], every [[luser]] and [[failbook]]-fag on the internet seems to have turned Keanu into a symbol of ''modern-man-conflicted''.  Thus, many people see Keanu symbolizing ascetic [[DO NOT WANT|distaste]] toward modern pursuits of [[rich and beautiful|fame]], [[Jew gold|material wealth]] and [[sex|creature comforts]] that [[America|Murka]] blows its load over.  

However, the paranoid assholes who manage Keanu's career (and obviously exploit him) are not having it.

Yeah so this is the epic [[faggot]] that tried to [[sue]] Keanu, but ended up getting [[pwnd]] when the [[judge]] laughed him out of court after catching him in [[lies|conflicting statements]] and finding out his [[bullshit]] claim was just a shameless ploy for jew golds...

Expectedly, that candid snap of Keanu looking [[ronery]] on a park bench was suddenly everywhere and was [[Oh exploitable|screaming for]] [[OC]].  The [[internets]] were happy to oblige...

{{quote|Grief changes shape, but it never ends. People have a misconception that you can deal with it and say, 'It's gone, and I'm better.' They're wrong.|Keanu}}

==Keanu lieks anime==
Apparently, one of the few things Keanu still enjoys in life is anime...
{{quote|Yeah sure, I like a good [[anime]] now and again. I mean, they're just television shows like any other, really, but they can really portray some interesting messages [[never|when done right]]. ...My favourites? Well, there's this one called [[lolwut|Cowboy Bebop]], that's definitely it. A few others like [[Akira]] and FLCL are cool. The [[nerds|Wachowski brothers]] showed me this movie called Ghost in the Shell, when we were doing [[The Matrix]], and that was really impressive.|Keanu on the set of ''Street Kings''}}
