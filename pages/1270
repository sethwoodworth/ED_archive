CMFL
The '''CMFL''' (Cambodian Midget Fighting League) is a Cambodian organization of [[midget]] fighters. Its current president is Yang Sihamoni.

In the past, the league consisted of [[42]] midget fighters. However, great [[drama]] started on the [[internets]] when Sihamoni claimed that his league was invincible. An angry fan retorted that a single lion would be able to defeat the CMFL. Sihamoni promptly accepted the challenge and arranged the match between an African Lion and the CMFL in a battle arena. Sadly, no video recordings are available, since the Cambodian government strictly forbade cameras from the arena.

The famed fight lasted only about 12 minutes when to everyone's shock a hero arose on the glorious [[battlefield]] of the coliseum in Kâmpóng Chhnãng of central Cambodia. A solitary lowly African Lion decimated the squadron of fierce blood thirsty Cambodian midgets leaving 28 declared dead and the remaining 14 severally injured with loss of limbs, broken bones and severe bleeding. Truly an unbelievable outcome, surely no one could have predicted the lion standing tall at the final bell. 

Since the historic fight against the African Lion, the whereabouts of the CMFL are unknown.
