No offense, but...
[[Image:Picket_fence_1.jpg|thumb|right|Not a fence.]][[Image:folds.jpg|thumb|right|[[lie|No offense]], but that's one [[fat]] [[ugly]] [[bitch]].]]

"No offense, but..." is a [[magic]] amulet against [[offensive|offending]] anyone's Puritan sensibilities. Therefore, it is the [[unfunny|opposite]] of [[lulz]].

Joined together with the twin gems of [[IMHO]] and the Devil's Advocate stance, it creates an enchanted shield that grants the user +5 versus personal accountability if he was level 16 yesterday afternoon.

==How to use "No offense, but..." in your daily speechings==

# Before you make a statement, don't think. Ideally, you should achieve a Zen-like blankness, which is conducive to [[fucktard]]ery. If you have to think, focus on cookies. Or bears, or bears made of cookies. Anything but what you're about to say.
# Make sure you have everyone's [[attention]]. You are the most important and educated person in the room. This is mission-critical.
# For maximum impact, just open your mouth and let a bunch of [[random]] [[shit]] fall out. This is called [[diarrhea|verbal diarrhea]].

Here are some examples. "No offense, but..."

* Can I touch your hair? It's just so... ''exotic''.
* GMO foods just taste better.
* If you don't like [[Metallica]], you're a [[fag]].
* [[Hitler]] was pretty efficient, if you think about it.
* I don't see what's wrong with calling you a good for nothing black person.
* I'm a vegan.
* I think Madonna is pretty good.
