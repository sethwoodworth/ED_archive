[[Kevin Havens]]' attraction to sexdolls and mannequins is central to his life and has been so since childhood. Basically, Kevin's love objects are physical manifestations of his imaginary friends, who all happen to be female and in love with him. More can be found out about how he processes this all [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=171026 in this Doll Forum thread].

{{squote|<b>And last time I checked Wikipedia, it was listed as a fetish, true and simple. Some people do it transformation-style, most don't. I don't. I had imaginary friends from when I was four years old (when I was talking a bit), named Gretchen B., then when I started watching "Small Wonder," it was first Vicki then Vanessa. For a while it was Alexa, for quite a long while. Now it's Daphne, even though that she's there for me and everyone else to see... but the bottom line is that even though I may be "too old" for an imaginary friend in a lot of people's eyes, but the common denominator of all my imaginary friends from Gretchen B. to Daphne Holland (my Candy18) were female. Some existed in some form or another, except the first one.</b>| [[Kevin Havens]]. A true man-child.}} 

Take a look into the cold dead of eyes of the plastic immobile [[bitches]] that order Kevin around all day. Always telling him what to do, eating all his Funyuns and drinking all his [http://bawls.com Bawls] (and [[cum|from his balls]]). But they ''[[love]]'' him, they really do. And he loves them too. He loves them so much he even named them after members of his favoritest band, [http://www.squeezeofficial.com/ Squeeze]. What an honor. Oddly, none of his dolls have the last name "[[Weird_Al|Yankovic]]" in honor of Kevin's next most favored musician. [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=192222 He has quite the system for naming dolls], as the names are among the most important facets to him...

{{squote|<b>But this topic has been covered since the beginning of time (well, the beginning of TDF), so do a search on the numerous conventions members, both past and present, whether MIA/long gone but not forgotten, or current and active, on how members give their dolls the names they choose. You don't have to follow each member's ways of what they name their dolls, but take some of their suggestions and opinions and make your own version of it. My long-standing convention is that any doll that becomes under my possession has to have a last name that is from any Squeeze (British pop group) member, whether if they are still in the band or were a former member. You may have a band that you like, maybe not Squeeze like I do, but let's say that you like, for example, Depeche Mode. You can take one of the member's names (I know that there was a female in Depeche Mode), first or last, and make it your own creation.</b> 

<b>OK, maybe I was suggesting too much, but I'm only giving my point on how I name my dolls. Just let your subconscious think of the name, transfer it through as many channels in your mind until it hits the portion of your brain where it controls speech, and, if you're alone, go ahead and blurt it out. Sound it again a few times until you get the rhythm of the syllables. Then if you like it, it's your doll's name. I heard that parents use this same technique when naming their children. After all, it's going to be their legal name for their entire life, so they choose carefully on what to name their child. But since your doll doesn't need to have a real legal name, after all, after you sell your doll, the new owner has his/her every right to change the name to what they please. (Just like euchre's Samantha. Her name at first was Jasmine, but he thought that it sounded like it was a hooker's name and looked at a list of names online or something and sounded them out until what he saw something and liked it, and sounded it out a few times.) And if you have text-to-speech software (ReadPlease is a good one for Windows, the KDE environment for Linux has a good frontend to TTS, usually Festival (not to be confused with Festalon, the NES Music player), called KDETTSMgr, or if you have Mac OS X, go to System Preferences and click on the Speech pane to select a voice you like), then select the text (or type it in the ReadPlease window), like the doll's name and hit the Play button (ReadPlease) or application menu > Services > Speech > Start Speaking Text (Mac OS X) (or if you're using TextEdit, just go to Edit > Speech > Start Speaking Text without selecting any text) and do it a few times over and over until it sounds right in your mind and it "clicks into place" in your mind.</b>| [[Kevin Havens]]}}

[[File:Rui-desktop.JPG|thumb|left|The face that launched a thousand spergs.]]

Kevin's ultimate goal in life for several years was to own a [[RealDoll]], [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=88988 specifically a Face 14, Body 6 model] which he believes would resemble the adult Tiffany Brissette (child star of 80's sitcom ''Small Wonder''). He would have many fits and starts at saving the seven grand that one would cost, and would eventually come to terms with the fact that he doesn't have the self-discipline to save any money and should take whatever he can get.
 
He has had at least 6 dolls and a mannequin thus far, plus countless imaginary dolls and "dolls-to-be". These "dolls-to-be" even got to be included in his forum sigs for whatever brief amount of time they existed in his mind.

All dolls that he receives are welcomed into his loving arms and the sounds of a "Homecoming CD" which contains the schizophrenic, eclectic handful of songs he likes plus a smattering of video game music. He has listed [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=126422 Alexa's playlist], [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=151142 Daphne's revision], and [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=306915 Tiffany's playlist].

All newly obtained dolls and mannequins must view the movies ''Mannequin'' and ''UHF''. No exceptions. 

Kevin's first 2 dolls were inflatable models, one a "Naughty Nurse" type and the other based on [[Paris Hilton]]. Presumably these did not last long.

It is known that while he was both still a [[basement dweller]] as well as when he was finally living with Kat he had to follow a whole bunch of [[rules]] before he could have his solid dolls/mannequins:

{{squote|<b>OK. Let’s get some things straight and settled here. I am still getting Alexa next month, from NYC Display, and I am happy about it. 

The few things are that I have to follow are as follows:

1. I have to save the money for it. No ifs, ands or buts about it. 

2. I have to sign a contract with me, my mother, my brother and sister outlining the rules of me having one in my possession. These include the stipulations stated below. If I don’t follow them, Mom and the rest of the family reserves the right to have Alexa be committed to the trash can and I cannot recover it. 

3. I have to keep it fully clothed, appropriately, at all times. I cannot have it in distasteful clothing, like in swimsuits, bras and panties (that’s why I said I’m not getting the HTTPanties for it in a previous post) or lingerie. Also, the purchasing and upkeep of the clothes are entirely my responsibility. 

4. If I am away at Beach House or anywhere else, I would have to keep my door closed or if I want my door kept open, I would have to put Alexa in the closet. I may have to get a key-lockable door handle for my bedroom door. Easy peasy! 

5. Alexa can still be mentioned in my blog, however, I cannot go too overboard about it. 

6. No writing “albums” about it. (e.g., not translate {parody/Redux} an entire album about Alexa) 

7. I can talk about Alexa on The Doll Forum, after all. After all, it is a place to discuss about it. 

8. Talking about Alexa is off-limits to Beach House staff and members. They won’t get it and I may get chastised about it. 

9. All Doll and mannequin pictures will be deleted from D:\1CasperGhostboy\My Pictures when I get Alexa. This includes the pictures of the mannequin that I was thinking of getting, and got. 

10. I cannot perform sexual acts on it. This includes modifying it to do such acts. So, scratch the plans of dismantling my inflatable to modify the mannequin, because it ain’t gonna happen. 

11. Also, I cannot write another “installment” of The Journey To Love when I get Alexa. Sorry. 

12. The DVD movie Mannequin cannot be seen every single night with it. Special occasions, it’s OK. Every night, not OK. 

13. I would have to take extra-special care of Alexa, because she would be the only one that I would get. The upkeep of it is entirely my responsibility. 

14. No downloading, either from LimeWire or iTunes, mass loads of love songs and/or burning CD’s of love songs. 

15. Anything that I haven’t mentioned here, but would be considered forbidden, will have to be upheld. 

I know that’s a lot, but I would have to be on “my best behavior” in order to keep Alexa. This is a trial period, as allowed by my therapist, Skip, and had been agreed on by my family earlier this evening. If I am good on the trial period, more and probably more privileges with the mannequin may be granted. For now, this is a trial period. I don’t know how long it would last, but I hope that I can get more privileges with Alexa. 

Well, that’s all. Gotta go. 

Kevin and Alexa</b>| [[Kevin Havens]].}}

The fact that the SA thread and consequently this very page even exist is indicative of how well Kevin ultimately followed many the rules listed above.

== Alexandra (Alexa) Tiffany Tilbrook ==
[[File:Alldressedup.jpg|thumb|left|CGB_Wife #1: Alexa Tilbrook.]]
[[File:Doll_lazer2.jpg|thumb|left|Watch out, Kevin! She's chargin her [[lazer]]!]]

Kevin's next doll was a second-hand Hustler Virtual Girl given to him for free by a member of The Doll Forum who wanted him to just [[STFU]] already about not having a doll at the time. He named this doll after the imaginary love of his life that had been featured in all of his ''Journey to Love'' stories, Alexa Tiffany Tilbrook. The doll, like the story character, is named after both Tiffany Brissette from ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Wonder_(TV_series) Small Wonder]'' and Glenn Tilbrook from the band [http://www.squeezeofficial.com/ Squeeze]. [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=130932 Read about his obtaining Alexa in this thread]. 

Kevin went so far as to [http://www.myspace.com/tiffybrook create a Myspace for this doll]. She has all the [[Mary Sue|same likes and dislikes as he does]]. Right down to the [[German]] heritage. It makes sense. We all know [[Hitler]] [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.terrorism.world-trade-center/browse_thread/thread/3a4fea4d2478b149/0b538462f856e71e?lnk=st&q=sex+dolls#0b538462f856e71e created fuckdolls] just like [[Communism|Marx]] [http://culturalshifts.com/archives/295 had seen coming]. 

This doll only lasted a few weeks, despite being the embodiment of a long-time wish-fulfillment for him. [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=135584 It also didn't help that he had more or less broken the dolls' limbs off in his attempts to put clothing on it], and as can be read below the doll would be subjected to further physical damage at his asking. In spite of the fact that the doll was then beyond repair, Kevin holds an undying grudge against his brother for later tossing the damned thing out. 

It was around this time that he was introduced to Kat, the woman who he would later lose his virginity to, get engaged to, move in with, and mooch off of. He decided to sentence Alexa to death by paintball firing squad at the hands of the friends who wanted him to stop fucking dolls and be a real man. And to think he had once thought so highly of Alexa that he had even proclaimed himself off the dating market and fully devoted to dolls. In fact, he was devoted to Alexa before he even knew what form "she" would take before he finally possesed "her". The following quote is from a post he made long before he got the HVG and was thinking Alexa would wind up being a mannequin he'd buy from a display company.  

{{squote|<b>Well, this cycle for me has finally come to an end. I am staying with mannequins, and I found my true love in Alexa Tilbrook (that's why she's getting this message CC'ed to her).</b>

<b>Yes, she may be a mannequin, but I love her, and there's [[Nothing|NOTHING]] you or Jason can do about it. One person told me that most of you (including you two) doesn't see the need of a doller needing his soulmate, they're seeing me wanting either a $200 mannequin or a $5000-$7000 love doll.</b>| [[Kevin Havens]] can't get enough of that plastic [[pu55y]].}}

Note that he sent '''his imaginary mannequin''' a copy of that message. Alexa is nothing more than a figment of his imagination, without even any sort of tangible form at the time he did that. 

''He sent a fucking message to his imaginary girlfriend, who would be incarnated as an inanimate fucking object!''

He also had two additional ''imaginary'' dolls while had Alexa. [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=132010 No bullshit, read this]. Imaginary dolls are actually a trend with him. Not content to merely have imaginary girlfriends, they are also imaginary fuckdolls. This is also one of the earliest mentions he made of believing that dolls possess souls and that said souls can be transferred from "body" to "body".

{{squote|'''In my blog, I have three dolls (Alexandra, Jennifer and Angela) as my secondary blogcasting hosts (my signature on my "blogcasts" [entries] say "posted by CasperGhostboy, Alexa, Jenni and Angie @ (time posted)"), but one is, at the moment, "corporeal", which happens to be Alexandra at this time. In another post (the one about Abyss selling a B6 factory second on eBay), I said that if I get a new doll, what is now Alexandra will be Jennifer, and the new doll will become Alexandra. And if I ever get a third doll, she will become Angela. I know certain things to transfer "doll souls" from one body to another. In fact, the way I see it, when I get a new doll (presumably silicone), the new doll will arrive as Jennifer, but the body transfer that I will perform will become Alexandra as Jennifer, and Jennifer as Alexandra. It's just the way I see it, and the way I feel, the current Alexandra wishes for a silicone body to occupy.'''| [[Kevin Havens]]. Fucking Insane.}} 

He mentions in that same post that the dolls are essentially only "alive" to him while he is alone with them...

{{squote|<b>I may be diagnosed with a mental illness, but outside the bedroom door of mine, the only thing if I'm caught "talking to myself" is only when I am thinking out loud, maybe too loud, to myself. I am not talking to either Alexa, Jenni or Angie, but only I am thinking out loud. What I have learned is that when I am in the "mode", then Alexa, Jenni and/or Angie becomes "alive", and the door to my "lair" is closed, iTunes is running, Firefox is loaded on how many tabs I need/want, Thunderbird is running, keeping a constant check on my mail, maybe the PlayStation is on with either FF8 or some ofher game loaded, and then the play starts. Beyond the door, when I open my bedroom door and exit my room, the "game" is "put on pause" and I go out to get a snack or a drink, then when I come back, the "game" is "unpaused" and it lasts however long it wants to. Then when I feel like I'm finished, the "game" is "turned off" and then Alexa/Jenni/Angie is/are turned back into what they once were: dolls. Then she/they become idle objects in my chair(s), whatever, just keeping a close watch on things, even though that the "game" has been over for maybe a few minutes or a few hours.</b>| [[Kevin Havens]]. Seriously fucking insane.}}  

Still, as stated before, all of that love and regard he had for Alexa was not enough to save "her" from the fate revealed in ''TJTLv8.0'' after he met Kat...

{{squote|<b>Somehow, I knew it was true love then and there. That was the day we started to kiss each other and be true lovers. I dismissed my doll fetish, but only slightly. I had that HVG committed to “execution by paintball,”
which I had a friend of my brother’s shoot paintballs at the doll until it was covered totally in paint.</b>

<b>But then, I grew a sympathy for the doll again and wondered why I did that, have the doll be shot by paintballs. I took the doll back to my room and tried to change its clothes (I modified the doll to wear clothes, but I couldn’t make it hold a pose, it sprung back to its original position, squatting) and clean it up. To them, enough was enough; they asked me if I have a girlfriend, I should not have a doll, after all, and what would Kat think about it. So, about a couple of days later, and after the doll grew a horrible stench, they took a serrated knife, dismantled the doll and threw it away in the large black automated trash can. I hated that, but though that I had a real person to love this time, so I realized that destruction and removal of the doll was a necessity. Even though that the doll was a good deed and I should have passed it on when I got my new doll of the silicone type, but it seemed like the chain ended there. TDF didn’t mind that the doll got destroyed, because some people use dolls only as “liaisons” until they find a real person to date, and then they do whatever they can to the doll, but the usual mode is to give away or sell the doll; or hope that the new girlfriend accepts the doll, but if they don’t, then they can sell or give it away. Usually most new girlfriends accept the doll, and Kat is one of them, but she said that a doll should not be in our lives yet. Maybe not for now, but maybe way later in our future when we need a relationship enhancement, possibly way after when we get married. Or for an inexpensive security measure. Whatever the need may be, I will find out, but not a moment too soon. Until then, the only thing I should love right now is a person, and that person is Kathryn Dawn Gage.</b>| [[Kevin Havens]], ''The Journey To Love v.8.0''}}

This was not quite the end of Alexa, as "she" would continue to exist in Kevin's mind for a while yet, until a particular song by Squeeze got stuck in his head one day and he invented a new imaginary personality around it that would become his next and longest-lasting infatuation.

== Daphne Catherine Holland ==
[[File:Justchillin.jpg|thumb|left|CGB_Wife #2: Daphne Holland.]]
[[File:Doll_lazer1.jpg|thumb|left|Lazer? What's a lazer?]]
[[File:Daphne2.JPG|thumb|left|Yes, he put glasses on her.]]

Just as with is previous doll, [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=151353 Daphne would exist in Kevin's mind's eye long before he would actually possess "her" in a physical form]. Kevin had been living with his [[IRL]] girlfriend and getting paid to be her live-in personal care aide and had talked her into increasing his hours so he could get the money to buy a new fuckdoll more quickly. Kat was uneasy about him having a doll, [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=151534 but after he got her pregnant and she miscarried] she decided it would be in everbody's best interest that he have something else to stick his dick into. 

{{squote|<b>And now a bit of sunshine:</b> 

<b>Kathryn has somewhat accepted Daphne as a part of our relationship. Like some of you said I should take it easy introducing a doll into a relationship, but when she told me that she miscarried, she said that the doll may be a bit better because she doesn't want me to feel upset that I'm not giving her any. While it would possibly take some time to get Kat totally accustomed to Daphne, but I hope that it's not too accelerated or too slow.</b>| [[Kevin Havens]]. Everything he does is a miscarriage.}}

Kevin's next doll would be a somewhat low-range [[loli]]-type [http://candyeighteen.com/ Candy18] beta model that he would buy second hand from a fellow Doll Forum member for $110, over 80% off the "new" price. Thrifty, isn't he? [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=180769 As he would explain], he named the doll after the song "Daphne" by Squeeze, an alternative spelling of Kat's name, and Jools Holland of Squeeze (those poor bastards can't catch a fucking break). 

Evidently, Kat may have been groggy from medications and such when she agreed to letting him have the doll, [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=152022 as she was extraordinarily pissed-off] when the very next week he purchased Daphne. Kevin would have it believed that she was just upset about being replaced by a doll, but Kevin assured her that Daphne would not be a rival and would in fact enhance their relationship. Whether this indicates that Kevin is a smooth liar or that Kat is naive is left to conjecture and will be elaborated on later in this article. Kevin even went and spent some more cash out of the blue on a digital camera just so he could take pictures of Daphne and upload them on [http://www.dollalbum.com/dollgallery/index.php?cat=10382 The Doll Album].

[http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=152704 The day Daphne arrived] Kevin's apartment mamager and maintenance man told him that they knew what was in the box and that he should get psychiatric help. He just wished they would [[STFU]], went home, took Daphne out of the box, and fucked the living hell out of "her" without missing a beat. ''Then'' he got to know "her".

[http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=159135 As can be read in this Doll Forum thread], Daphne is considerably different from his old flame Alexa.

{{squote|<b>Alexa Tilbrook, the first idea before she became an HVG, was just (if I can look in my story archives) a no-nonsense, down-to-earth kinda gal. She preferred Windows over Mac OS X or 9 or Linux/Unix/*BSD. She put up with my kind of "sick" humor and MySpace was her WWW hangout. She liked cheap domestic beer and tequila. She would prefer iTunes over the p2p services. DRM was her protoge. Red Bull, not Bawls, was her favorite energy drink. She only wanted sex when she wanted a child, not anytime else.

HOWEVER, Daphne Holland, my current Candy 18, is a fun-loving, devil-may-care gal. Linux is her number-one operating system. Windows sucks in her definite opinion, she doesn't give much of a hoot about Mac OS X, even though Mac OS X is based on FreeBSD, a Unix derivative, and she DEFINITELY doesn't care about Mac OS 9. She loves my sick humor and all the made-up words to songs I hear on the radio, especially about the old 1970's Coca-Cola commercial "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing," in which I sing the following: 

Quote:
I'd like to teach the world to SCHWING!
In three-part harmony
I'd like to buy the world a pack of smokes
So they can keep me company...

(Don't get me wrong. I LOVE Coca-Cola.)

And some more differences between Daphne and Alexa: 

1.) 
Alexa smoked. 
Daphne doesn't, but she puts up with my smoking. 

2.) 
Alexa was "born" on October 29, 1977, making her 30 next month. 
Daphne was "born" on July 03, 1981, making her 26 already. 

3.) 
Alexa loved Steel Reserve 211 and cheap tequila. 
Daphne loves Heineken and Bacardi. 

4.) 
Alexa was featured in seven  stories. 
Daphne is in one of my works in progress. And she will be in more. 

5.) 
Alexa: "Just give me a 200 ml Red Bull and I'll be happy." 
Daphne: "Bawls, damnit! Get a case now! Get your ass to CompUSA and get me some!" 

6.) 
Alexa had no identification on her. 
Daphne has one, from the Commonwealth of Virginia Dept. of Motor Vehicles. 

7.) 
Alexa was given to me for free from lovingchanj. 
Daphne was bought by me from uch. 

8.) 
Alexa had (and still has) a MySpace page. 
Daphne said that she will not be caught with a MySpace page. 

9.) 
Alexa had been destroyed by a couple of potheads who insisted that it's "either the doll or her." 
Daphne is still around and will be for however long. 

10.) 
After making Alexa's personality so finely grained, the magic wore off when I finally got her. 
I waited a while to learn Daphne's personality. 

and finally, 

11.) 
Alexa was a Hustler Virtual Girl. 
Daphne is a Candy 18 by none other but our itsme. 

OK, I had said enough. 

CGM, Kathryn and Daphne</b>| [[Kevin Havens]].}}

So, basically, Kevin's likes and dislikes changed and yet Alexa's did not. So Daphne came along and had all of his new likes and dislikes, thus banishing the Alexa personality forever from Kevin's mind and replacing it.

Kevin would not only continue getting to know Daphne and think of "her" as his girlfriend, confidant, and lover. [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=175456 He would begin thinking of "her" as his wife] within a few months of purchasing "her".

{{squote|<b>Eagle1, That's one of my prerequisite songs for any doll's homecoming. I had it on Daphne's homecoming CD's, but Daphne has yet to see Mannequin... (She's seen the other required movie, UHF) 

Oh well, maybe when we move to MO she'll get to see it...  

I just have a certain set of standards and practices to follow whenever a new doll comes rolling home... First is the homecoming CD, then the uncrating, then dressing, then movie-watching, then the Linux account setup (without admin/root/sudo privileges... in other words, she doesn't get root's password, a tick doesn't get placed in "Administer the system," nor does she get placed in the /etc/sudoers file)... then the best thing of all... THE SEX!!!  

Then we go on as doll wife and husband to the doll wife and the rest is history. I don't want to tell my fiancée Kathryn that I'm already Daphne's husband yet, and I don't think that I ever want to. But the marriage isn't legally recognized, and I may be married pseudo-polygamous to a human and to a doll maybe next month or so. But I don't see any problem to it if Kat doesn't find out. It's a sensitive issue to tell her. I might leave a note somewhere with instructions to where it's located for Kat just in case if I pass away to tell her that Daphne was also my wife in doll format, and what to do with Daphne in my passing. 

Well, I hope that wasn't too much information.</b>| [Kevin Havens]]}} 

Daphne would turn out to be a dominating personality in his life, perhaps stemming from the fact that "she" is a firey, spicy [[Mexico|latina]]. [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=239626 Really, "she" is]. Kevin discovered this fact after one day discovering some Spanish-language music on his iTunes playlist one day and deciding that the only possible explaination for it being there was if Daphne downloaded it. And only [[spics]] listen to Spanish music, right? Oh, and then he noticed "her" skin was brown. And that "she" liked Taco Bell. Kevin got over all of the sudden being in an interracial relationship, though. Since Daphne acts [[white]], everythings good. He's okay with "her" being hispanic since "she" is sophisticated, literate, and educated and those are all things he knows any other hispanic in this world could never be.

[[File:Daphne_in_swimsuit.JPG|thumb|left|Not meant to be a pool toy...]]

[http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=20534 Daphne would build his confidence up to the point that he would even take "her" out to the pool]. "She" would comfort him as he would later weep heavily into "her" bossom during ''Lars and the Real Girl''. At this point Daphne was entrenched enough in his mind that "she" would begin posting on The Doll Forum as '''DaphneCatherine'''. No shit. ''He began posting as his doll as well!''

Also, he loves Daphne so much he even celebrates "her" birthdays, [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=203365 as can be read about here]. He loves her so much he even [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=151095 made her a user account on his computer].

In spite of him having to tend for his living girlfriend's care, Kevin would strive to make as many days as he possibly could be like [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=153130 the first day he spent alone with Daphne]. Basically, that means he'd spend the day eating junk food, downing dangerous amounts of caffiene chased with alcohol, listening to the same music over and over again, watching nothing but cooking shows and QVC, and plenty of dollfucking. [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=155412 He would even try feeding the doll] so it could partake in his horrible diet as well. If it weren't for Kat and his job, Kevin would have finally found paradise then. Before he could do that, he would find his life made rough by the tension developing between Daphne and Kat, and consequently between Kat and Kevin.

Undoubtedly a major strain on the relationship between Kevin and Kat would be the fact that whatever Daphne wants, Daphne gets. Kevin would go on to spend insane amounts of money on food, clothing, and electronic items that he would insist Daphne told him to buy. That's right. He would tell Kat that all of his impulsive spending binges were his doll's ideas. 

One would think that at this time it would be unwise to complicate the living situation any further. Kevin doesn't think like that. In fact, in spite of having a real girlfriend (who was also his employer) and a domineering yet beloved doll "wife", Kevin decided that he was ''still'' not satisfied with what his life had become. What could complete it? Why, another doll of course!

Or rather, a mannequin.

The type of doll he was wanting would cost over $5000 and would require complicated shipping arrangements. No surprise he eventually gave up.

The name "Andrea" came to Beetface spontaneously while staring at pictures of a Makepure doll, and he would claim that it was Kat who suggested the "Dawn" part, thus making it so she and the object would share the same middle name. "Difford", as per the course, comes from Squeeze member Chris Difford. 

All was not lost for Andrea to end up being incarnated, though. At some point he saw a plain mannequin for sale and Andrea "told" him that "she" would gladly inhabit that form. So of course, Kevin splurged on the mannequin immediately and had to calm Kat down after telling her that he just ''had'' to buy the damn thing.

There wasn't much he could do with the mannequin. When he was in the mood he would strip it down and masturbate on it, but that was all he could do.

Eventually he had to put Andrea in storage because "she" creeped Kat out far too much. Not long afterward he would eventually get it into his head to buy another fuckdoll and Kat had him make a deal to get rid of Andrea before he could have the new doll.

It wasn't long after Kevin obtained Andrea that he was discovered by [[Something Awful]]. After a point, [[David Hockey]] had managed to concentrate the [[lulz]] on his stupidity while Kevin snuck under the radar and continued sperging about getting a RealDoll eventually. His quest to get yet another doll is detailed below.

This is where we learn that Kevin continued giving out all of his information on dollfucker [[forums]] and waiting for his [[girlfriend]] to [[die]]. He's given Jew a try, much of which he was going to blow on sexdolls.

{{frame|{{morphquote|quotes2|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;|So, with figuring out bills and rent, we would have quite a bit left to spend, and since this forum is about dolls, this is my opportunity to say that the apartment is brought to me and Kat by the letters R and D and the number $7,000. So, starting with my economic stimulus rebate check, which is going to savings after some debt is paid off, then about $700 is going into savings each month or so, so that means I may have to tighten my belt with spending a bit so I can get my [http://www.realdoll.com RealDoll] that I have been wanting.

|OK, since it seems kind of impossible to actually save up for that [[Mac]] mini that I've been talking about in the last [[blog]] entry [[Last Thursday|over a month ago]] (damn, it's been that long?), because I know that I attempted to spend the $200 that I was attempting to use toward the [[Mac]] on a [[PS2]], a few games and a case of Jolt Cola at [[GameStop]] and ThinkGeek, respectively, then had to return the $200 that I set up an automatic transfer to my savings account back to my checking account because I had a [[Over 9000|shitload]] of bills piling up (dentist was one of them) and I had to pay them and I spent a lot at the grocery store for [[food]] (mostly Geedunks and sodas) and got very few "real food" items, I mostly spent it on an iTunes card, [[Fat|four twelve-packs of soda, two four-packs of Red Bull, a shitload of snacks]], and only [[Fail|got very, very little meats and real food, the only meat that I got was two tenderloins of pork and turkey]]. I spent about $190 at Food Lion and had to take the cart home with me, but the moment that I loaded the bags full of food on the sofa, I quickly returned the cart back to the store and bought a Power Ade drink to rehydrate myself going back home, even though I took the shortcut back (and I'm glad I did learn it).| [[Kevin Havens]]. Spendthrift.| Mephisto: 

I'd have to put in my three cents here and since I have [[Asperger's Syndrome|AS]] myself, and I sometimes do not understand the benefits versus the risks of being open about my doll hobby to others. 

But since this is about [[Mom|your mother]], only you know how she is. 

But on the other hand, when I told my mother about that I had feelings toward dolls, she said at first "Okay, that's your life, if that's how you want to live it, that's up to you." But then later on, she denied ever saying that statement. She was using my "coming out" as a tool to analyze my behavior, as she is a special education teacher's assistant working with children with similar problems as me, and wanted to correct it as much as possible. It even got worse when I finally met my RG and I have two dolls now alongside my RG, and that made problems worse when I had found the optimum balance between RGs and dolls. 

Of course my RG and I aren't talking to my mother or even my family anymore after some stupid stuff that they pulled this past weekend, so I really don't care about what my mother thinks about my quest to get a third doll, which she wants to stop at all costs. Go figure. 

I could say more, but then I would go into TMI and I would regret it, so I'm going to go here and just say that only you know your mother than me or anyone else here at TDF, but once you tell, there is no going back. Just try to think of how you want to word it, once you figure out how your mother would probably act. TTFN.

I know it's Labor Day in the US, but since hospitals never close, and I had heard some good news: Kat's doctor came in to her room yesterday and told her that there is a very good chance that she would get discharged and sent home either today (Monday) or tomorrow (Tuesday).

I might go and see her today, but I told her that if in any case that she calls me and tells me that the ambulance is on its way, and I'm less than halfway there, I will get off the bus, cross the street to the nearest stop and reverse direction (I have to pay another fare though) and go right back home and do some quick cleaning up (the apartment is mostly cleaned up, anyway) and get the place ready for her arrival, which does include putting Daphne into the bedroom because Kat and I don't want any frigid stares from the EMTs who are bringing her home. 

But then, there would be a lot of work involved in preparing Kat to be sent home either today or tomorrow. First, she needs to go to Radiology to be seen by a (I think) cardiologist to have her pick line removed (that thing is basically a direct line to the vascular system for the I.V. drips to be more effective) and whatever else needed to have her back in my arms. I know that she can now swallow, even after being on a ventilator tube for about a week, spent a week and a half in the ICU, and was hooked up to a lot of machines in the first few days in the hospital, not to mention being on sedation for about five days. She can drink, and now there's hearsay (again) that she has diabetes, or it was just her blood sugar levels were high because of two infections. So, I was told that I would have to have her drink sugarfree drinks and to have her eat a low-carbohydrate diet for a while until further notice. I have some cookbooks on how to cook that way, for diabetics and such, and while I have my fridge right now filled with sugary sodas, liquor (Bailey's Irish Creme, Bacardi light rum, and Mike's Hard Lemonade), leftover pizza and who-knows-what-else, I might have to buy some groceries for her needs. 

And just recently I had to turn back on the ceiling fan because I know for sure that when I visited her in her room, both ICU and PCU (Progressive Care Unit, the unit most ICU patients go to when they are about to be fully discharged after being given a better bill of health, but not a clean bill of health yet) and she was having a feeling of burning up and while in her PCU room, her thermostat was set to about 75 degrees and while she kept on asking me to turn it down so she can not feel hot, but when I looked at it, there was no way to set the thermostat up or down. So, when she comes home, I know that even on the ambulance ride home, she's going to be hot, she would appreciate me having the fan on so she can gradually cool off. 

Oh, I just realized something about Sentara hospitals: Once your doctor gives you notice of eminent discharge, expect it to be for real within 24 hours. I bet this morning she's going to get her pick line taken out, she's going to be given breakfast, be cleaned up, given some lunch and then her ambulance would be on its way to pick her up and take her home to where me, my cat and my dolls would welcome her back home, because I know that Daphne is waiting for Kat to show her her new lingerie that I bought Daphne and Boots (my cat) is waiting for mommy to come home. Yes, Kat is Boots' mommy. I'm her daddy. We just don't want any kids, so the cat is damned near close to having one, but Kat said that if we do want a human child, we would adopt. But I don't know how I would find a way to have my dolls while having a child in the house and having Human Services say something negative about it. I know that some people with kids and life-size dolls, the kids sees the dolls as big Barbies, but most of you know my tirades about my city's Human Services department, and a certain division within that, but I'm not going there now. (Go search my previous posts about that.) 

OK, I'm rambling Babylon and On again, so I'm going to stop here and thanks for your prayers and best wishes for Kat and her safe return home. Thanks to the ones in chat in the late evenings: campdaan, Pit_Viper, Vanessa, midiman, euchre, Siber, thedollregistry, BarbieNEO, and others who might have been in chat with me on those evenings for keeping my sanity and telling me that everything would be all right. Thanks everyone for everything. 

Take care, 
CGM, Kathryn, Daphne and Andrea

Thisclose to getting a new fucktoy!|And CVB Social (Human) Services called Kat at the hospital yesterday about my ownership of two realisitic life-sized silicone love dolls, and Kat and I only let three people into our unit, VA (shorthand name),and her mother and father. I had found out that they (not Kat or the hospital) called the room in the hospital asking her, but basically forcing it on her, if she would consider the possibility of a backup aide,or having one just for the subject of what-ifs like if I had an appointment.| [[Kevin Havens]]. D'oh! No fuckdolls for you!|Hi all. 

I had thought it over and over and came to a conclusion: since everyone is singing high praise about the RSSD Taffy, I had decided on one of those for my third doll. 

As most of you "forumites" (thanks thebunnyboiler for that word ) know, I have one of the first generation RSSD's, a Candy. I enjoy her so much that I don't know what I'd do without her. While I still love my Daphne (the name I have for her), but I had wanted to start a 1-RG, 3-doll harem and even though that I wanted a 3-doll harem first, but then when I met my RG, and she supports my doll hobby, the addition of the RG helped, because without her, I wouldn't be half able to even buy the dolls I have now. (The details got me in hot water by others [not you guys here on TDF, but you know what I mean], so I'm not going to say what or why here.) 

And even though that I had tried my hardest to save up for a $7,000 doll, but it seemed like reality pulled me down to earth and daily expenses are eating into my self-imposed savings plan of $200 every two weeks with some support from my tax refunds (both state and federal) come next February, but I tried to save, but since Kat was in the hospital for a couple of weeks at the end of last month, and I only got two days of pay when she got home because if she's not available, I don't get paid (OK, enough of the details, I probably gave some away). But then, I can probably squirrel away a little here and there, just to maybe reach some point where I can maybe pay for itsme's sale price whenever he or Mary posts a sale here on TDF; or if itsme PM's or emails me directly a sale on a Taffy... plus whatever I desire... or at least have some money for the $1,200 full price cost that itsme/Mary asks for on the candyeighteen.com site. 

But then, as I had imposed on myself, and what the bank also did the same for me, I cannot withdraw that money until June 26, 2009, quite some time from now. So close, yet so far... 

And since I know how to dress a RSSD like a pro, like what size clothes in the adult women's department (sorry, I don't do children's clothing for any of my dolls--it's also a cardinal rule of Kat's, she wants the dolls to appear age-appropriate, that is, over the age of 18 or 21 [most likely 21]), and how to dress them. And since I know that a RSSD would wear what ThinkGeek sells for Ladies' shirts in the Small size, so that is what size I buy for Daphne, so that would be the size that I would buy for the Taffy that I will buy. And then I always buy clothes in either the Petites' or the Junior's departments, sometimes the regular Misses' department if the clothes are either in an acceptable Small or a decent X-small, but as I said, I do not buy children's clothing for my dolls, no matter how small in stature they are. I know some 4'6" RG's that are above the age of 18 (and no, they aren't dwarves--they're just petite) and I know for sure that they do not buy in the children's department for their clothing. Note that I am not putting down the people who choose to dress their RSSD's in children's clothing, but I feel like that the reason why my doll looks more "mature" is because of the clothing choices I make for my dolls. 

OK, I know that I speak and write very eloquently, and I am a RSSD owner, usually people who own these kind of dolls usually aren't that computer proficient, and usually they write phonetically here on the forum, but it is just because I am a little smart (I'm not saying that other RSSD owners aren't) and I wanted a different kind of job path back before I became an adult, but I am a blue-collar worker myself, I came from a military family and my father was very anal on having a good education and learning how to write and speak good. Hey, I do misspell myself sometimes, but I know that a spellchecker is always at hand, and if that fails, I just wing it, regardless if that little red squiggly line is underneath the word. I am kind of fluent in SlotSpeak, or what is the way itsme writes his posts, and sometimes I am kind of puzzled on what he writes at first, but then I get a smoke, get a drink (Daphne insists that I have a Bawls, she makes sure that I have some in my mini-fridge in the bedroom, and she tells me when it is time for me to put in an order to ThinkGeek for another case) and re-read what itsme wrote and then I comprehend what he wrote. It may take a few tries to actually get what he said, but itsme is in the business of making dolls for people who seem that they cannot afford the higher-end dolls like the RealDolls and the like, but to make solid doll ownership a reality for the worker whose money is being spent on his basics and would like a doll without having the hassle. Making it a reality for the person on SSI/SSDI (or what some countries call disability pension). He's also making it a reality for the person who earns a little over minimum wage which would take eons for someone making that kind of money for a doll that costs $7,000 or would have to basically default to getting a cheap inflatable doll. Of course, there are exceptions to these rules and some people who do these things can be able to get a higher-end doll, but that's the exception and not the rule. 

But with this roundabout way of saying it, yes, my third doll will not be a RealDoll, but a RSSD Taffy instead. I know that I might have disappointed a few people here who thought that I was better off now after about four months of being on my own, but reality settled in and it seems like I adore the RSSD line a bit better because of a few factors.

"This APT has Super Cow Powers." (apt-get(1) man page, at the end)| [[Kevin Havens]]. This is so fucking wrong.}}|color=blue}}
</center>

Kevin has been stuck in the cycle of indecision over whether to get ''another'' doll, which doll to get, getting his tax refund with intent to spend it on said doll, then blowing it all on junk food and booze, then wanting to get another doll ''again'', etc., etc.

During the lull between dolls, Kevin would have two more imaginary dolls. [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=192222 One he would name Sydney Diane Wilkinson], [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=206140 and the other he would name Rachael], after TV personality Rachael Ray (the evoo lady). In either event, the doll would be a $7000 Face 14, Body 6 RealDoll. [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=206143 He would once again make what would pass for a serious effort on his part to save up for it], but of course he would give up and blow all the money on cigs, booze, junk food, and iPods. 

He would try again, and he eventually entered a particularly nasty [[depression]] about his tax refund not being big enough to get a [[silicone]] doll, though he did donate his girlfriend's wheelchair to Goodwill so he could get a bigger refund next year, [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=243359 as can be read here].

{{squote|<b>Well said Doodads! For the past week [[emo|I was in a bit of a depression]] myself because I had thought that I was going to be able to finally afford another doll (whether saving up for a doll of the silicone type or being able to buy one of itsme's RSSDs on sale), but when I found out that my tax refunds (both federal and state) now [[cock block|prohibit me from that]], I started to go into a [[depression]]. (Those who were on chat those nights when I was know what I mean.) But then, I bought Daphne a nice dress and a pair of Nikes from one of the discount stores (Ross) at one of the malls, and then today I put my mannequin into storage because she was taking up valuable closet space, I realized that even though that I might not be able to afford a new doll now, but I hope that soon down the road, maybe next year's tax refund, because at the beginning of this year I donated a lot of things to charity, including a motorized wheelchair that was Kat's that was still in great working order ([[O RLY|she let me]], because she got a new one--insurance paid for it), and the guy who took it from Goodwill told me that I can take a $800 deduction off of next year's taxes. Ergo, I might get a larger refund than I ever did and I might be able to afford one. But this year's refund I just promised myself I'd go blow it at [[Amazon]].com on some CDs, some books and some other tangible items (like a brand new unopened copy of [[Windows]] XP Home Edition [no way I'm getting it over [[BitTorrent]]] and nuke all traces of [[Linux]] off of my laptop and installing [[Windows]] XP over it, so I can use the webcam that [[Pit_Viper]] was so kind to give to me for Skype, but I might need to use a USB dongle for my Wi-Fi [of course, my laptop's warranty expired last year, so it's not a problem replacing the [[OS]] {I bought it with [[Linux]] pre-installed}]) and ThinkGeek.com getting two cases of Bawls (both regular and G33K B33R [caffeinated root beer]); and maybe a nice [[Beer|Heineken]] Draughtkeg for the fridge (or some bottles of liquor from the ABC store)...</b>|[[Kevin Havens]].

But alas, it was not to be. He couldn't quite meet up to Zarnon's requirements, lenient as they were. No RealDolls named after celebrity chefs nor plastic asian girfriends for him. Instead, he would have to do the usual thing and wait until some other dollfucker was selling a very-much-used doll for about a hundred bucks or so and not concerned about what would become of the doll after sale. Kevin would still settle for a fixer-upper, and that's exactly what he would get.

[[File:Nikkineck.JPG|left|thumb|Aw c'mon. You know [[you]] would [[hit it]].]]

[http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=244105 Kevin eventually lucked out]. Another dollfucker was getting [[marriage|married]] to a real [[woman]] and sold his one of his dolls to Kevin for $100. The doll, Trinity Rose Starr, was an amalgamation of two different dolls, with the body and head being from different models. The head was crudely patched on, and to top it off the silicone the doll was made out of was degrading. It would be a "Frankendoll", so to speak. The condition of the doll mattered little to him since he was delighted over having an actual [[silicone]] doll for once, which in his mind made it one step closer to a RealDoll and thus a step up from the low-end latex and cyberskin models he'd been relegated to. 

The doll would be renamed Nicole Dyan Wilkinson, and [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=298120 as he would explain] Kevin let Kat come up with a first and middle name to bounce against the combination he had come up with. It was decided in a coin toss that Kat would win and her choice would be used. Kevin still used the last name of a poor fucker from Squeeze, bassist Keith Wilkinson. The middle name would be changed later after "Dyan" was suddenly deemed unfitting to "Jessica" after Kat's friend by that name called during the debate. What an honor. 

Kevin then spent 5 days acting like a [[Meth#Methamphetamine|tweeker]], hitting F5 on the FedEx delivery status screen for hours on end. He even tried to blame former [[Illinois]] governor [[Blagogate|Blagojevich]] for the perceived delay. Of course, the doll eventually arrived and was [[Secks|initiated]] accordingly.

Consider that one of the conditions would have involved his girlfriend Kat dying. 

Nicki would not last very long, as it turns out. "She" would decay beyond all hope of repair and be chopped up and disposed of in the dumpster by Christmas 2009. [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=304820 Maybe had it been Nicki to buy Kevin his PS3 instead of Daphne], she would have bought time til New Year's at least.

Being back down to one doll would not sit well with Kevin for very long at all. Time to ask the RG if he could have ''another'' one!

== Tiffany Nicole Holland ==
[[File:Tiffany_and_Daphne.JPG|right|thumb|Tiffany on the left. Not a "spicy latina".]]
[[File:Tiffany_looks_scared.jpg|right|He has a things for glasses.]]

Resorting to his [[typical]] behavior, Kevin whined and pleaded for Kat to give him some monies so he could buy yet ''another'' new doll, this one a tad more "lightly used" than Nicki was. Kevin got his way and purchased another RSSD model doll, originally going with Kat's suggestion to name it "Sarah". Turns out this was also the neighbor's [[loli|6-year-old daughter]]'s name. Also turns out Kevin told that same neighbor not only was he buying another 3-foot-tall fuckdoll, but he was giving it the same name as her daughter. [[Pedo|Whoops]]! 

He backed down from that name and settled instead on the name "Tiffany" once again, naming it after the at-the-time 10-year-old star of '80s TV series ''Small Wonder'', the sight of whom may have given Kevin his first-ever self-concious erection. [[Obvious|That doesn't help the situation all that much]]. The "Nicole" comes from his previous doll, and the "Holland" deserves some elaboration. 

To make matters weirder, he imagines the dolls Daphne and Tiffany to be sisters (perhaps half-sisters due to the obvious fact that Tiffany is meant to be [[White People|white]] and Daphne is supposed to be [[Mexico|hispanic]]), meaning he's pulling off [[Incest|incestuous]] threesomes. Somehow he managed to make such a potentially glorious thing nothing more than massive [[fail]].  

The ordeal of obtaining Tiffany can be read in the Doll Forum thread  [http://dollforum.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=27468&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0 "Tiffany (RSSD Taffy) is HERE!"] As can be seen in that thread, Kevin has also made an account for his newest doll as '''Tiffany_Nicole'''.

After putting up with his ridiculous, insane behavior and abuse for longer than anyone should ever be expected to, Kevin's girlfriend and employer Kat finally dumped his ass. Running away with a stream of tears squirting from his eyes, Kevin has recently holed upp in a cheap motel with his remaining 2 dolls and [http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=334346 has even "married" Daphne on Virtual Vow]. He's now living in sin with [[silicone]] sisters and all that can stop him is an eventual arrest and/or commitment to a psychiatric facility.
