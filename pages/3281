Genetic Sexual Attraction
[[Image:forbiddenlove.jpg|thumb|There's a book, so that means I'm off the hook!]]
'''Genetic Sexual Attraction''' is a nonexistent "genetic phenomenon" used by [[sick fuck]] adoptees to justify fucking their siblings after they are reunited.  In some cases it is also used by [[pedo]]s to justify fucking their kids. Like all fake syndromes which use [[bullshit]] and [[DNA]] to absolve people of the responsibility for something, for example [[incest|fucking their relatives]], it predictably has a sizable [[Internets]] support group at [http://www.geneticsexualattraction.com GeneticSexualAttraction.com].  The support group is also predictably used by its administrator, Barb Gonyo, to hawk her book on the subject.

This [[chat log]] sums it up nicely:
<blockquote>prima: man i wish I'd heard of genetic sexual attraction when i was 12<br />
prima: I'd have impregnated some chick and then disappeared so i could meet the kid at 30 and fuck it<br />
secunda: *choke*</blockquote>

To this, site administrator and  Barb Gonyo responds "If you are 17 and she is 16, no matter who she is, you shouldn't be having sex at all," a perfect example of the [[batshit]] conflation of [[christian|Christfag]] moral values with the promotion of [[incest|sister-fucking]].

[[some argue|Certainly there are questions]] about how pedophilic attractions can be [[suicide|expressed]], but how can you question a person's right to experience their particular reality. what's more, zlurkers comments are essentially on the topic introduced by radical_neutral, & his suggestions have some value.

At what point would you set limits on his right to exist? are you really in a position to judge him, given your somewhat homicidal & fascistic [[uber]]-morality? Would you support a '[[final solution]]' for pedophiles, given that the vast majority are guilty of [[CP|no crime]] & harm [[children|nobody]]?</blockquote>

Yes. Because you should.

==As drama-generating technique==
One can generate instant drama pretty much anywhere by claiming to have fucked one's sibling or kid and then defending it.

Typical development:
#Dude, 28, posts long adopted sister-fucking back-story
#Greek chorus of
#*"Do not bone your sister!"
#*"Do not try to date an 18 year old!"
#*"That's not the problem, the problem is he shouldn't bone his sister!"
#Dude says his family is actually really old fashioned and is not going to approve
#Greek collective chorus of "Dude, what the '''fuck'''".
#Dude says he's been reading about how meeting a sibling you didn't grow up with frequently causes this effect and there's a whole website devoted to people who praise the ultra close relationship
#[[At least 100]] more outraged posts ensue
#????
#Profit!
