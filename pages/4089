Internet license
[[Image:StopInternetPolice.png|thumb|left|X-treme [[fag]]gotry is considered a 3rd degree Internet criminal offense.]]{{elaw}}An '''Internet license''' is the legal document that enables you to use the [[internets]]. When you are caught by [[Internet police]] doing something unbelievably [[fucktard]]ed [[OL]], you will have to go to [[Internet court]]. If you are found [[Internet guilty|guilty]] of extremely grave charges, you may have your Internet license revoked, which is the hardest punishment in [[Internet Law]].

It should be noted that [[Internet court]] only revokes Internet licenses when serious offenses against the internets are committed, like "X-treme [[fag]]gotry [[OTI]]" or "Posting [[AIM]] convos".

Without an Internet license, you can't access the Internet at all; which means no [[email]], no [[pr0n]], no [[LiveJournal]], no [[ED]], and obviously, no [[lulz]].
