A white supremacist and anti-Semite, this [[insane]] [[woman]] is apparently on a mission to get herself [[ban hammer|banned]] from as many communities as possible. Mostly contributes to communities; posts consist mainly of lengthy pseudo-scholarly rants on irrelevant topics. [http://www.livejournal.com/community/hood_of_israel/5020.html Proven AOLer]. In some of her greater fits of [[retard]] she compares her "suffering" to that of the old Jew [[Bible]] prophets, as well as Job, from the Book of Job, who lost all his [[Jewgold|Jewgolds]], all his children, and was afflicted with a terrible case of [http://web.archive.org/web/20011204211506/http://www.princeton.edu/~ahutgoff/otadventure.html boils]. So basically, she thinks God is making her life miserable and testing her faith because he has nothing better to do (srsly, that's the story of Job; God made his life hell for the lulz).

She also moderates a community known as [http://www.livejournal.com/community/hood_of_israel/ hood_of_israel] in which she rants against "mongrels" and Jews to [[Noone|anyone who cares]] to hear about it. She is against all of humanity turning into [[big brown blobs]]- famous examples of which include academy award winning and ultra hot actress Halle Berry, rockstar Lenny Kravitz and Gun's N Roses Guitarist Slash. She is convinced that Jews are the spawn of Satan and that Anglo-Saxon whites are the true Israelites, among other batshit insane theories. Also, she is sad that Abraham Lincoln got elected.

== Detailed Analysis ==
While she vehemently claims [[not racist|not to be a racist]], she publicly admits, in fact, ''[[Evangelical|evangelizes]] endlessly'', to being a member of the [http://www.acts1711.com/identity.htm Christian Identity] church. She also posts at the forums of the [http://www.stormfront.org/ Stormfront White Nationalist Community].

"Christian Identity" is a label applied to pseudo-religious groups primarily concerned with race hatred. Most of them promote a militant white supremacist and [[Nazi]] version of Christianity. Christian Identity groups assert that the [[white people]] are God's chosen race (not Jews, as it so clearly says in the Bible) and that whites comprise the ten lost tribes of Israel.

Purelily regularly uses [[circular logic]] to argue her points. Purelily is a Christian Identity revisionist, and as with most Christian Identity revisionists, her arguments revolve around interpretations from the Bible that are looser than her twat.  This system of loose interpretations allows her to encapsulate her own prejudices, [[conspiracy theories]], and an apocalyptic view of the "Word" with religious ideology. 

It should be noted, however, that it is possible to reach several other conclusions from such loose interpretations as that adopted by the Christian Identity movement- such as, for example: 
*[[Jesus]] was [[black]] and/or a [[pedophile]].
*[[Homosexuality]] is perfectly acceptable and [[God hates fags|even encouraged by God]].
*Jesus was a racist hippie punk
*[[Atheism|There is no God]].
*[[Scientology|That aliens started the human race]]
*[[JEWS DID WTC]]

[[goatse|Circular logic]], [[logical fallacy]] and [[divide by zero|base rate fallacy]] are just some of the many basic logic mistakes Purelily makes in many of her "discussions". 

The term "discussion" is used loosely in this case - in that any exchange Purelily is involved in is not so much a conversation between two individuals, but rather an opportunity for her to spout huge lengthy lists of babble and Scripture that, for the most part, have little or nothing to do with whatever topic is being discussed. If she was any sort of intelligent, she could use this in her favor and call it a "polemic", but she's not that smart.

The standard for her judgments are as such: 

1) Does the source support or deny my ideas<br>
2) If (support) then source = reliable<br>
3) If (deny) then source = part of the [[worldwide Masonic conspiracy]]<br>

Any opposing point of views are considered to be under category 3, and therefore a part of the [[Socialist]] Liberal Homosexual Agenda. 

Asides from constantly proving herself to be a racist (while simultaneously denying to be as such), she also [http://www.livejournal.com/community/anthropologist/375321.html believes in giants]. One of her arguments for the existence of giants is that ancient artifacts such as the Stonehenge and the statues on [http://www.livejournal.com/community/anthropologist/376472.html Easter Island] are "on a large scale" and were therefore built by giants. Her arguments, therefore, support the fact that [[American]] leaders of old - such as the ones depicted on Mount Rushmore - were, in fact, giants as well.

==Purelily Expands Her Campaign==

<blockquote><i><center>THE DEADLY WOUND</center>

Christians wake up. It's high time to stop the influx of illegal immigration into this country that is designed to bring the U.S. down. It's time for Jew to rise up to the calling and stop illegal immigration. If the illegals continue to bombard this country, there will be mass chaos resulting in marshall[sic] law implemented by the Zionists. WE CAN inflict that deadly wound to the Zionist one world communist system by stopping illegal immigration!

There is a rally in washingon DC this very day by some Mexican advocacy group that wants the Govt to stop rounding up illegals and give them more rights. This has to stop!!!

Get the word out to everyone you know that it's time to stop this taking over of our land. It's time to act and take back this country.</i></blockquote>

In this entry, Purelily has revealed that she does not know how to spell "martial" in the correct context, or does not wish to as the word martial is often linked to the far east, land of the non-white, yellow peoples- often in the form of "kung-fu" movies, which are popular world wide. What ever the case, her implications of "marshall law" do not make sense.

Or she's a Tekken fan with OCD.

==Update==
Purelily is apparently moving forward with a lawsuit against her ex-boyfriend and current {{lj|lilmisother}} utility dick, Seth. While they are hush hush on the details they did contact {{lj|Evil_Genius}} for a copy of the epic 666 comment moron-a-thon. LJ has since demanded he delete said conversation or be deleted himself. Did Evil Genius have a backup of said conversation in his dramafiles??? You bet your sweet ass he did. 

With any luck when the court case is over we here at ED will receive some kind of an update. 

Synthetikmisery's planned exposé and public humiliation of her never came to fruition. Thanks Synthetik.... You suck as a mole.
