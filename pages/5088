MUD

== MUD (Multi User Dungeon/Domain): The Beginning ==

The first MUD was formed in a dark and ungodly basement library, in central America way before the [[internets]] turned.  Instead of words and pixelated [[ascii]] graphics mixed with [[yiffing]] and much fucktard-ery, it was filled with wobbly old moulding tables, creaky wooden chairs and FERAL [[geeks]] drinking Mountain Dew --whilst eating vast amounts of Cheetos and Peanut Butter Cups. These unkempt [[faggot|beasts]] were noted for being the greasiest and most repugnant ''"life forms"'' ever to exist, grunting about their custom made weaponry, armor and how much their imaginary [[girlfriends]] put out. Fast forward a little in time, and these same greasy beasts are still there, but they are now part of the digital make-up of the more modern MUD --but not in their original form. 

They have mostly changed into mighty morphin' power [[nerds]], taking on the form of high level [[trolls]], [[trolls|giants]], goblin kings or ethreal beasties that only the most skilled MUD-ling can overcome.  They have devoted so much time to their beloved MUD that they have fused with their keyboards through the ages and have become at one with their server.  Any attempt to prise them away from said servers will result in culture shock, seizures and in more extreme cases, [[DEATH]].  At this stage they require no outside nourishment, as the server itself feeds them on the life-force and mana from whichever puny mortal falls prey to them in-game. They are the very epitome of [[computer]] [[geek|nerdery]].  

== MUD Life ==

MUDs (capitalised like that unless you are a [[terrorist]]) are mostly used for [[cybersex]], and size comparison of internet [[penis|PENISES]].  People who MUD are without exception horrible [[basement dwelling]] [[gamer]]s who enjoy living vicariously though Sir Knight Stupidass Longname the level 50 barbarian, or some overly flamboyant bard like  e-tard that flounces about in a fucking stupid costume, singing about how many flowery butterflies he/she caught with a net, and how much gold some ugly warty gnome king paid he/she for their spoils. They are not unlike [[LARP]]ers, except they have an even greater aversion to going outside and bathing. Heavily addicted users have been known to kill themselves if their character on the mud dies, as recounted in the Jack Chick horror story "[http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0046/0046_01.asp Dark Dungeons]".

Entry level MUD'ers might still be relatively sane, if not for their desire to be there in the first place.  They will at first treat their MUD platform like a glorified [[IRC]] client, attempting to make friends and search for that ever elusive real life [[girlfriend]].  However, as time progresses, they will be sucked into the dual existence of MUD-ery and real life.  They will become less and less sociable, give less of a fuck about their appearance, and survive on a not so staple diet of sugary drinks and convenience junk foods.  In short, they will (if they were not already) turn into fat smelly [[fucktards]], with breath foul enough to kill a bear at 1000 paces, and hair matted enough to nest a small family of owls. 

{{fat|COOKIE MONSTER ALERT.}}


Given that one of the first quests you are given to perform on a MUD will involve some sort of vermin like rats, beetles or other such nasties, each user will likely end up treating the creatures in actual life, in the same manner as they would on their beloved MUD.  Squashed insects or rodents will be collected and bagged.  They will actually pause for thought at how many they've got saved up and how much gold they can get for them.  Initially, they will shake themselves up and remind themselves that they are NOT online, but are in their kitchen doing the dishes, where and unfortunate spider has fallen into a just washed cup. Later on down the line in their total transference into MUD life, they will have stopped doing the dishes entirely, and may even resort to eating dead insects as part of their not so staple junk food diet.  The fact that there will be more nourishment in a dead spider is a moot point --it is all part of their progression into a totally pathetic existence.

If the MUD'er is adult and has a family and responsibilities, over time they will spend more and more time away from them in an effort to devote more life force to the cause.  They will skip daily personal grooming to add extra time to [[raids]] and [[furries|vermin]] collection.  They will have forgone their physical duties to their partner, in favour of fapping away into a wank-sock to an imaginary girl/boyfriend on the other side of the [[internets]].  They will call in sick to work, just to make up the lost experience points after dying doing their guild quests, and forego family time to hold clan meetings and such, usually to discuss who has the mightiest [[penis]] in the land, or which [[faggot|faggoty]] bard wrote the best [[faggot|faggoty]] song of the week. Eventually they will get fired, and their families will have left them, although it might take them a week or two to notice, especially when they call for a soda refill and get no reply.

== MUD Player DEATH ==

Eventually, these pathetic [[emo|freaks]] will [[emo|die alone]].  The only link they will maintain with the outside world is their [[internets]] connection, and their online shopping delivery of junk food.  When it comes to their time of passing, they will sit there unmoving and unafraid, in the full belief that when they die their life-force will be sucked into their MUD server, where they can forever roam and be happy.  What actually happens is that they faceplant onto their keyboard and rot away, to be found some weeks later by the local police department as a result of a neighbour reporting a particularly bad stench emanating from their house, covered in slime and maggots and reeking of [[shit]]. Weeks can turn to months, as this is not much different than the smell normally escaping the [[gamer|fag's]] dwelling. 

== Explanation ==

Propagandists will try to explain MUDs by comparing them to Zork or other [[text-adventure]] games, even though only 3.2% of MUD users have ever played more than five minutes of any text-adventure game before getting confused at the first puzzle. The average mud has several notable distinctions between it and Zork, the largest being that Zork has no cybersex commands. There really is no easy explanation for MUDs other than the fact that they are a gathering of the the wankiest people [[gay|EVAR.]] (Well, except for [[World of Warcraft|WoWfags]].)

Others will claim there are several different ''kinds'' of MUDs, perhaps even going so far as to use the words MU* or M**. These people are '''[[Train|wankers]]''' and liars of the worst kind. The only notable subdivision is that called a 'MUSH', which is their code for "[[furry]] themed MUD." Obviously, these should be avoided at all costs unless you enjoy gouging out your eyeballs when confronted with two nine-breasted hermtaurs [[cybersex|typefucking]].

==Prominent MUDs==
There are a bunch of MUDs on the [[internets]], and 90 percent of them are furry. The other 10 percent are about [[Transformers]], or used explicitly for [[cybersex]], or a combination thereof.
