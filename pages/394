[[Image:AlvinEarthworm.gif|thumb|[[Original Character|Alvin Earthworm's namesake character is totally original and has never been done before!]]]]

'''Alvin-Earthworm''' ('''[[Powerword|Mark Haynes]]''' [[irl]]) is a member of [[Newgrounds]], [[deviantART]], [[furaffinity]] and [[YouTube|anywhere]] [[AGNPH|else]] where he can [[Attention whore|whore]] his [[pathetic]] self out to. He's [[e-famous]] for his flash animated series ''Super Mario Bros. Z'', a sprite animation series with the story of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', replacing the characters and objects of DBZ with the ones of the ''[[Mario]]'' and ''[[Sonic]]'' series. It has [[None|no]] [[Original Content|original writing, audio, or images]]...so naturally [[13-year-old boys|everyone living in this crazy digital age]] [[Facepalm|thinks it's super awesome]].

==SMBZ==

[[Image:ghettosinger.jpg|thumb|No TARTlet before him has ever been so wrong.]]

Out of all of the [[shit]] he has done, ''[http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/supermariobrosz.html Super Mario Bros. Z]'' is his crowning "achievement". SMBZ is a compilation of Mario and Sonic sprites in a Dragonball Z setting.  [[Pokémon|Animu]] from the nineties. It would not be an overstatement to say that, in the process of [[Masturbation|“animating”]] this overhyped ball of fail, Alvin-Earthworm has expended no creative effort whatsoever. One wonders, then, why does it seem to take Mr. Earthworm so many months to complete an episode? Is it some sort of twisted scheme to get his legions of idiotic fanboys to salivate all the more with anticipation? Could it be that he realizes that, by spacing out the episodes so far, he propagates the notion that what he does is “art” and takes actual effort? The latter possibility is at best unlikely and arguably beyond his cognitive abilities, seeing as SMBZ isn't original by any means. That does not change the fact that the way it was executed (poorly) is what made this series loved by [[retards|its fans of today]]. Of course, there are still many fanboys out there who want to throw their hat into the SMBZ world and propagate the failure even more. 

More likely, Alvin is just a fat fuck who's too lazy [[What|even to ''not work'']], and spends all of his time eating [[Pocky]] in his mother's [[Basement-dweller|basement]], while masturbating to pictures of [[Furfag|foxes with breasts]].
===Fan site===
''Super Mario Bros Z'' has its own [http://vglag.com/ fan site] with its own horde of [[13 year old boys]]. Its [http://vglag.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=16 forum] consists of sections such as '''Super Mario Bros. Z Comments "''Post up all your comments that you wish to tell Alvin-Earthworm about his popular hit internet flash show Super Mario Bros. Z in here!''"''' and topics such as ''The Most Stupidest Character To Ever Join Smbz'' and ''SMBZ Series 2''.

Here's an excerpt of in depth discussion from the SMBZ fandom...
<pre>
Sure, Shadow seems like an @$$hole, but here are some things you may have overlooked.
1) Even though Shadow barely ever agrees with anything Sonic plans, but he still goes along with it.
2) Shadow kicked Sonic in Ep.4 cause he was majorly *^^*ed before due to the fact they lost to the 
Koopa Bros., and Sonic says something smart that further *^^*es Shadow off and made him act before 
thinking and kicking Sonic in the face. (haha)
3)There really is no excuse for Shadow using Sonic as a projectile against Turbo Mecha Sonic (Ep.6),
 so I'll just skip it.
4)Shadow kicked Mario to save Mario from one of Turbo Mecha Sonic's flash bombs.
You see? He's just misunderstood.
 -JPW

to 1: Sure, cuz he is looking for a fight.
to 2: Sonic just said what´s right and Shadow hit him, PFFT.
to 3: Cuz he is an @$$hole, don´t skip "important" facts. [[emoticon|tongue.gif]]
to 4: WRONG, every shot from Mecha Sonic hit the ground BEHIND Mario AND Shadow. Shadow just kicked
 him, cuz he was in his way. Rewatch this scene.
My opinion: Stop making excuses for him, he acts lordly, arrogant and irresponsible, just like 
Vegeta. Point
 -Super-Yoshi

I hope you're not forgetting that he kicked Mario out of the way while fighting the black and red
 Koopa bros in that one scene. (ep 4)
 -HellSlayer

For once, Shadow has been wrongly accused. If you look closely, Shadow's back is facing Mario when
 they colide.
So yeah, Shadow hits Mario, but not on purpose.
As for using Sonic as a projectile (which I for one, found hilarious) is perhaps acceptable on the
 grounds that Shadow was much more of a match for Mecha.
 -Subach

Like Superstar Saga and Partners In time, there should be a new game for either Wiiware or Ds and called...

Mario & Luigi: Interdimensional Alliance

You know it's based on the Chaos Emerald Saga, right?

==Furfaggotry==
Alvin-Earthworm is a [[furfag]]. When he's not working on [[Shit|SMBZ]], he's sits on his ass creating [[typical]] furfaggy pictures of [[Fox|foxes]] with breasts, or creating typical furfaggy pictures of ''already existing'' foxes with breasts, such as [[Renamon]] and [[Krystal]]. And the times when he DOESN'T draw something with fur... [[Homosexuality|he draws men...]]

==Drama==
Besides [[Shit|SMBZ]], he is also known for causing [[drama]] on the internet. One of the most notable drama is his infamous "[[Bullshit|I DON'T CARE]]" rant which was originally posted on DA and Newgrounds before he [[Delete fucking everything|deleted everything]] off his two accounts, proving that his [[Bullshit|wall of text]] was nothing more than a distraction to stop [[trolls]] from trolling him, and thereby also proving that he is a [[butthurt]] [[faggot]].

You can read the wall of text in question here:

{{Squote|
This journal is aimed at [[the lulz|haters]]

People will already know that ever since [[Shit|SMBZ]] became popular that [[Good|there have been people who hate me for it]]. [[Spam|Spamming]] my PM inbox, Making [[Hate art|hate flashes]], getting into bitter flame wars with me and [[Irony|generally being assholes]].
I can be a [[hugbox|sensitive person at times]], but that's about to change. After having a long sit down with a nice strong [[coffee|cappuccino]], I thought to myself, "Why the fuck am I letting these [[trolls|dickwads]] get under my skin?"
Such behavior can only be dealt with by [[shitposting|an adequate response]], and that is.... [[bullshit|'''I don't care!''']]

Seriously, [[Bullshit|I couldn't give two shits anymore]]. [[Emoticon|XDD]]
[[Bullshit|'''I don't care''']] [[Anonymous|who you are]]. [[Bullshit|'''I don't care''']] about your opinions on me, my art and animations or my attitude. [[Bullshit|'''I don't care''']] about your [[hate art|hate animations]] with [[penises]] (And you call [[truth|me gay]]? [[Emoticon|XDD]]) and hate propaganda. [[Bullshit|'''I don't care''']] if you think SMBZ is [[Truth|degrading the quality of animations]] on Newgrounds. (That's coming from the same people who [[Irony|spam crap]] into the portal). [[Bullshit|'''I don't care''']] about [[irony|your parents who obviously did a crappy job raising you]]. And [[Dying alone|'''I certainly don't care''']] about [[Irony|your faggoty friends, brothers, sisters, pets or anyone who have to put up with your worthless existence]].

'''You guys are [[Irony|nothing but a bunch of prepubescent, no talent, attention whores]] living thousands of miles away somewhere in the heart of Retardsville, leeching off [[aspie|my popularity]] [[Irony|to get some attention]] and [[lulz]]. But now I'm gonna do [[Nothing|something]] I [[Never|should have]] done [[Never|a long time ago]] and that's [[Bullshit|ignore you!''']]
So go ahead, [[flame]] my accounts with your [[Irony|immature]] insults. [[Spam]] my PM boxes. Make more of your gay [[hate art|hate flashes]]. Tell everyone that [[Truth|I'm an egotistical furfag]]. '''[[ok|Do what the Hell you like!]] [[Dying alone|It really doesn't bother me anymore.''']] All you are really doing is making yourselves look like complete dickheads and [[Never|maybe some day]], [[No|you'll come to your senses and realize that you have only been wasting your own time]].

'''I focus on [[deviantART|what's important in the REAL world.''']] [[Shit|SMBZ]] is just a hobby that I like to work on during my free time. Seeing you guys get all worked up about it is perhaps [[Irony|the most childish thing I've ever witnessed]]. [[Irony|You guys seriously need to get a fucking life!]] [[Emoticon|XDD]]

The [[internet]] [[Irony|is dumb]] and [[Trolls|haters]] [[No|are living proof of that]].
And that really is all she wrote. Have fun [[Script kiddies|kiddies]], for [[serious business|I am sick of playing]] your [[assrape|childish games]].
[[Lulz in hell Trollfags|See you in Hell!]]

==The end?==
In his journal, on 2008, Alvin-Earthworm was apparently abandoning his [[Shit nobody cares about|current dA account]]:

{{Squote|
Well, ever since starting [[shit|SMBZ]] I stumbled upon a [[shit|concept]] that proved pretty successful and made me into an [[internet celebrity]]. [[Attention whore|I enjoyed the fame and attention]] at first, but now, it has [[butthurt|proved far too annoying and stressful for words]]. Fame [[Irony|is pretty overrated]] and [[Lies|I desire the humble life out of the spotlight that I once had back when I first joined DA]].
So I'll be leaving behind my alias as Alvin-Earthworm, probably to start over. Besides, it's not like anyone cared about my [[Shitty art|anthro art]] anyway. [[Truth|All you guys cared about was the next episode of SUPER SPRITE FAGS X EPISODE 69!]] 
I stayed patient, I wanted to work on it in my own time on top of earning a decent honest living, but naturally it wasn't good enough for any of you and my patience has worn thin. [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|So I'm leaving behind this shadow of my former self and SMBZ along with it.]]
I know many of you will be [[butthurt|disappointed]] and well.... tough [[shit]]!
Anyways, this is where I take my leave. 

[[Shit nobody cares about|P.S. Refunds for old commissions that I haven't done will be promptly paid back. Leave me a note, the amount you paid and your paypal e-mail address and I'll get back to you.]]

Alvin over and out.

Man I thought you were a great guy but [[Truth|YOU SUCK YOU RETARD YOU JUST CANT TAKE IT YOU ARE WEAK SELFISH AND A BIG FAT LOSER!!!!!!!]] i cant beleve you just cant take it anymore you [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|FAGGART!!]] and no i am just a [[13-year-old boy|kid]] and Yah [[Fucktards|regular Kids]] Watch your freakin stuff and you are lucky to have this power for animating and you dont care a bit that you have [[ALL_CAPS|FIVE FREAKIN MILLION PEOPOLE WATCH YOUR STUFF]] and if I had flash I would Continue this saga You Big [[LOL_WUT|RETARDED DED RETARD MAN WORM THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]] thanks alot you loser Yours Truly Jmustern DarkFlame

Now do you see why I'm [[Delete fucking everything|starting over and not telling anyone where I'm going?]]
[[Fantards|People]] seem to care and support you for one minute then when you don't give them what they want, they show their true colors.
|Alvin-Earthworm}}

[[Politicians|It was debated]] whether or not he would [[An hero|get off the Internets for good]], until this post came along:

{{Squote|Well, I'm still waiting on the mod to [[Banhammer|close this account]], but before that happens, I guess I owe many of you [[shitposting|an apology]].
My [[BAW|outburst]] [[Bullshit|was justifiable]] since I have had very stressful days [[Masturbating|at work]], bad insomnia and the fact that my plans to see [[Whore|LakituBoy]] during the month had to be canceled. We all [[vent]] our [[Rage|frustration]] in some way, I guess I have a bad habit of [[You are doing it wrong|doing it the wrong way]].
Therefore, I shall be leaving the internet behind for [[At least 100 years|a few years]], only keeping in touch with [[Weeaboo|Keri]] and my close friends on [[IM]]. I've reconsidered creating a new alias to use on Deviantart since my motivation to work on [[Shitty art|pictures]] hasn't gotten any better. But regardless of how I feel, '''[[DO NOT WANT|I still want to complete Super Mario bros Z.]]''' Mostly for myself, but also as a thank you for the majority of people that have been patient with me.
Even if I worked harder on my [[Shitty art|anthro works]], I finally realised how much more I achieved with my [[Shit|sprite series]], regardless of [[Truth|it being merely fan service]].
So this will be the last time you hear from me for a while. My DA, Sheezyart, FurAffinity and YouTube accounts [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|have all been wiped]], but my NG account [[Hypocrite|will remain active]], only so I can post new [[Shit nobody cares about|episodes]] upon completion. PM's and e-mails regarding SMBZ shall be wiped immediately upon [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|recieving]] them, so don't bother trying to contact me.<br>Anyways, [[No|Perhaps we shall cross paths again in a few years?]]

Alvin Earthworm, over and out, [[Hypocrite|for the last time]].

So, unfortunately, he didn't [[An hero|take that bit of advice we gave him.]]
