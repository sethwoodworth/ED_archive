The League of Anti-Flamers
[[Image:Bloody Speirs by Gav Imp.jpg|thumb|The League of Anti-Flamers: Protecting the creators of "wonderful" art such as this from flamers.]]
[[The League of Anti-Flamers]], run by the wholly inept agent-CHAOS, is a shoddy and ill-managed attempt to save the popular kids on [[DeviantART]] from people who don't think their shit doesn't stink. Due to the fact that not only is the leader of this group made of fail but that most [[flamer]]s are in fact [[troll]]s, this will inevitably lead to great [[lulz]], but not [[great justice]]. 

==Conception==
[[Image:Moar Newbery.gif|thumb|And they will be led by someone who doesn’t even have a basic understanding of the message system…]]
The League was conceived by agent-CHAOS on March 2, 2007 when he "had the idea of forming something called The anti-flamer leauge. this group of people is formed to help people with any problems that they may have with flamers. I have thought about this [[at least 100 years ago|for some time]] and this can help people if they need people." 

The next day, he started rallying masses. He left notices on the comments pages of several users, garnering the attentions of about eight people. Realizing that he might actually have found enough people dense enough to believe this might accomplish something, he set to work on the club's manifesto.

It should be noted that these people decided it would be a good idea to follow someone who doesn't even know how to respond to comments on his user page or send a multi-recipient note. These gentlemen are extraordinarily [[retarded]].

==The Rules==
[[Image:LAFThe rules.PNG|thumb|The rules. It would stand to reason that if you’re fighting flamers, you shouldn’t be one yourself. Of course, this is a [[noob]]’s work, so…]]
The unofficial rules were set in place on the 8th. They read (with courteous spelling checking agent-CHAOS is unable to provide) as follows:

[[Lies|I have worked hard on this]] and I have come up with some unofficial rules and guidelines for the league.

[[Tl;dr]] story [[midget|short]], don’t be a [[hypocrite]]. That’s for [[fag]]s.

Come the 10th, he made another journal entry in which he [[copypasta]]'d the rules, only this time, they were the Official rules. Since you can easily make edits to previous journal entries and alert everyone watching you to these changes simultaneously, agent-CHAOS made yet another display of his ineptitude and [[newb]]bery.

==The Meeting==

[[Image:time Zones 2.gif|thumb|Mantarok1255 explaining the intricacies of time zones.]]
Later that day, agent-CHAOS visited every one of his members' pages to inform them via their comments block that he had arranged a meeting in the chat room he created, leagueofantiflamers, at 6:30 that evening.

No one showed up.

This is because, in a festival of [[fucktard]]ery, agent-CHAOS forgot to mention just what timezone his 6:30 was in. No one knew when to be in the chatroom, thus the first official meeting of the League of Anti-Flamers was made of inattendance and fail. Several members at this point chose to give him [[wtf|whatfor]] in the way of messages pointing out his asshattery.

==Fighting Back==
What exactly does the League of Anti-Flamers intend to do about flamers? So far all they’ve come up with is this:

{{quote| My first idea is to comfront the flamers and talk to them. Second I had the idea of using the league as some sort of group for support to those who are harrassed by flamers. third I thought that if a flamer is persistant then the league has [[whambulance|no choice]] but to report them to the [[admin|administration]].|agent-CHAOS}}

You’d better watch the fuck on out. agent-CHAOS and his league will do the same thing all [[lolcow]]s do when confronted with opposition. [[Trolling]] is [[for the lulz|advisable]], as they don’t know how to fight the type of people they think they’re fighting in the first place, much less a group of people whose actual goal is [[ruin]].

==The Future==
It remains to be seen if agent-CHAOS will ever [[RTFM]] and learn to manage a proper organization. However, regardless of whether he does or not, it’s still certain that the League of Anti-Flamers will fail horrifically, hopefully (in the interests of maximum lulz) due to [[self pwn]]. 

Unless agent-CHAOS can remember to leave timezones on his notices, this is highly likely.
