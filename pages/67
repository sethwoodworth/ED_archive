==The story==
Basically, a [[Sheezyart]] user named "w33n" took a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5vx2itH49s KFC commercial], edited it to only show the black guy, and then added a low-bit version of the [[ALF]] theme song into the background. He uploaded it on Sheezyart, which assigned the [[random]] number of "2204355" to it. The animation later found itself on ImageShack, but the uploader never renamed the SWF file. Eventually, this ImageShack SWF become the first Google search result for "2204355", which mean clicking "I'm Feeling Lucky" would take one directly to that file. Users then proceeded to trick other forums and chan-board member into visiting the file by telling them to click "I'm Feeling Lucky", which resulted in a sort of [[rickroll]].
