The main goal of Operation Reconnect is to get a powerful, influential message across to the public and to the Houston Scientologists concerning $cientology's "Disconnection" policy. As you know, Anonymous is unable to protest directly in front of the Co$ building. Attempts must be made to gain legal access to the lot in front of this Co$. We need signed consent from the owner to protest in the lot. If the owner of the lot likes money, perhaps bribery is an option.
<br><br>
For Operation Reconnect, [[Christians]] will be ready and willing to join protests. Plan flyer groups to put fliers on cars in church parking lots in and around the [[Houston]] area.
<br><br>
It is important to keep things light-hearted as this will make us more approachable to the public. Serious messages should be simple and direct: $cientology destroys families, $cientology supports forced abortions, etc, also any references to removing $cientology's Tax Exempt status are WIN. Easily-understood humor (such as caturday) will help combat $cientology's attempts to paint us as some kind of domestic terrorists. 
<br><br>
The HPD has implemented regulations on our protest signs. It is best to not have sticks for your signs. Proper sign sticks may be provided at the protest.
Remember above all else that the HPD and local media is ON OUR SIDE. Listen to and respect the cops. Be courteous to reporters, and don't say anything that you wouldn't want appearing on national TV.
<br><br>
Many Anon ranging from geezers to silly sausages will be in attendance unless they [[die]] before the protest in a freak [[F40PH|METRO]] accident.

{{quote|I understand your concerns about Scientology. However, I do not favor revoking Scientology's tax-exemption because I oppose raising federal taxes on any individual or group, even when I disagree with elements of that group's political agenda. The precedent of tax-exempt revocation may some day be used to justify raising taxes on other tax-exempt groups, including religious organizations.|Congressman [[Ron Paul]]}}

The rules for this protest will be very similar to the last one. Again, the HPD is on our side and very helpful to our cause; let's keep it that way. No violence. Stay peaceful. Remember the [[rules]]:<br>
