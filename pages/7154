SLI
{{stupid}}

[[Image:NVidiaSLIfatty.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fatty]] here wants you to buy [[moar]] nVidia hardware.]]
SLI is a ploy by nVidia to get you to buy [[moar]] of their graphics cards and motherboards. The same effect can be achieved by getting an ATI Crossfire card, which does not require you to have a motherboard that ATI says is kosher.

== History ==

SLI, or Scalable Link Interface, is a term coined when one combines more than one graphics card together for [[massive damage]]. Originally Jew by 3DFX in 1998, it is now utilised by Nvidia. A top end SLI setup will cost $1000 just for the graphics card, another $100m to build a nuclear reactor to provide sufficient power, and more Vespene gas to construct additional pylons.

== Benefits of SLI ==
SLI is the BMW of the gaming world. Having it serves no legitimate purpose, costs a shit-ton of moneyz, and makes your [[e-penis]] feel bigger. It also encourages douchebaggery.

'''Examples of SLI Usage'''
*Trying (and failing) to run [[Crysis]].
*Showing all of your friends how many NPC Zombies you can spawn in [[Garry's Mod]].
*Posting your 3DMark Vantage scores to every hardware forum you can find in a Google search.
*Having 4 independent LCD monitors.
*Watching 4 high-definition [[pr0n]] vidz simultaneously on said monitors.
*Playing any game released before 2025 (none of which actually utilize SLI completely).
*[[Fap]]ping to your maxed-out graphics settings in [[Modern Warfare 2]].
*<s>Running Folding@Home to help cure the world of cancer.</s> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]], need the bandwidth for porn torrents.

== Trolling SLI Fanboys ==

If anyone argues against owning SLI, usually [[fanboy]]s will say that you are jealous and you cannot afford them, even though you do not give a shit about being able to see the edge of barb wire, or you actually do something useful on your computer other than [[masturbation|whack off]] to games. Just tell them your $100 card runs games perfectly, then watch as they try to coax you into spending more on an 8800 GTX (or 2) to be able to run 2560x1600, even though your monitor only supports 1280x1024. Or tell them that you can get infinite AA at an infinite resolution by going to your local park. A typical "war" thread usually stems from someone asking what graphics card they can buy for $100, only getting advice from [[fanboy]]s insisting they spend $500 instead.
