[[Image:An_Runescape_Hero.png|right|thumb|Maarten's suicide note.]]
'''Maarten''' aka '''maarten16020''' was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[13 year old boy|fourteen year old boy]], who in [[2006]] decided to become [[An Hero]] after one of his friends [[hacking|hacked]] in to his ''RuneScape'' account and stole eleven million [[Jew Gold|''RuneScape'' gold]]. This story makes Maarten even more pathetic than [[Mitchell Henderson]], as Mitchell actually lost something of real value, and not just a bunch of pixels and the friendship of some [[16_year_old_Japanese_schoolgirl|Guy]] on the internet.<br><br>

Before hanging himself, the little [[fucktard]] announced his oncoming suicide in the best way possible, by posting a [[Suicide#The_Note|suicide note]] on the message board of his clan. His [[friends]] responded by spamming with [[memes]], until they found out his threat was actually [[Serious Cat|serious]]. It wasn't long until the raped ruins of his account were divided between his [[aspie]] clan-members. Gameplay went on like normal, and not much was lost, as the internets has way too many depressed basement-dwellers anyway. Ironicallly, his clan was called HoF-[[an hero|Heroes]] of the future.<br><br>

Generally the small yet retarded [[fucktard]] has provided a lesson to all ''RuneScape'' nerds. GTFO [[IRL]] and give us our much deserved [[lulz]]. Maarten must however be thanked for bringing the [[faggotry|danger]] of retarded video games to the attention of the [[Old Media]].

And nothing of value was lost.

==Dutch News Article==
Dutch newspaper ''[[Redneck|De Telegraaf]]'' carried an article about Maarten which you can find [http://www.telegraaf.nl/i-mail/34502521/Jongen_(14)_hangt_zich_op_na_computerspel.html here]. 

'''AMSTERDAM''' ''- A 14-year old boy from Bunnik hung himself after he felt betrayed whilst playing a computer game. His school in Utrecht bade him farewell on Wednesday ''

''The last straw causing him to commit suicide was the realization that a [[friend]] [[Hacking|hacked]] his account on the popular computer game ''[[RuneScape]]''. Before he [[An hero|committed his act]], the boy placed an English farewell message on its website. He wrote, among other things, that he had a lot of problems at school and at home. He said he had little support and was disappointed.'' 

''His rector said in her valedictory address to the students: " I think it is good to remember that there are always people who want your support in difficult and gloomy times. It's hard to get used to the idea that he is no longer in the classroom, no longer runs through the corridor and no longer cycles with us to school. I just wonder whether Maarten himself realized this when he chose for this life to end."''
