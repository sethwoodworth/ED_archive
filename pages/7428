'''Sharisasweetie''' is an internet [[troll]] who enjoys posing as a [[12 year old girls|12 year old girl]] and writing horrifically bad [[Fanfiction]] on Fanfiction.net. She is well known for her fan fiction, [http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3633390/1/We_Used_to_Be_Friends We Used to be Friends] which is basically a Veronica Mars fan fiction, crossed over with 10 other fandoms. Being the master troll that he/she is, they've managed to fool the entire Fanfic writing community into believing that they're a real person.

Sharisa, knowing that [[fantard|fantards]] can't help but bash terrible fanfics, decided that it would be the perfect ploy to write terrible Fan fiction about a series that [[nobody gives a shit]] about. Sure enough, someone eventually stumbled upon her fic, and plastered it all over insignificant LJ communities, causing a giant stir, and likening her fic to [[My Immortal]].

To further strengthen the illusion that she's a real person, the troll has created an entire universe in which she has a [[IDK my BFF Jill|BFF named Katrina]], who she constantly fights with, because she's a lamer who reads [[Harry Potter]]. Sharisa has stated many times that she is straight, and 'not a lesbo', but continually writes [[lesbian]] [[sex]] in her fanfics. This should be one of the many revealing factors that shows that Sharisa is indeed, just a troll. If you want to experience a conversation with her, contact her on AIM at '''sharisasweetie'''. Big shock, we know.

==Two LJers talk to Sharisa==
Two LJ users by the names of Sarah and Livie contacted Sharisa during their cold, lonely reading of their friends list. During the conversation, Sharisa dropped an SoS in the form of this message:

 Sarah (3:24:21 PM): do you like chuck norris?
 sharisasweetie (3:24:35 PM): i know '''endykeopeddia rattica''' lykes him
 Sarah (3:24:48 PM): what is that?
 sharisasweetie (3:24:57 PM): '''a website'''

It's obvious that the only words those could be are ''Encyclopedia Dramatica'', the site you happen to be browsing right now. OSH-

Of course, this flew directly over their heads, and the conversation went on. You can read it [http://xlivvielockex.livejournal.com/57514.html#cutid1 here] if you need some lulz.

==Shari Goes to Boarding School==

Sometime [[Last Thursday]], Shari went to her [[BFF]] Katrina's house, and together they want to a party was being served. Conveniently, Shari's arch nemesis han't been invited to the party, and informed Shari's parents of where she was. Then, in an oh-so convenient matter, her parents walked in on her making out with another [[slut|girl]]. As a result of this, Shari has been shipped off to Catholic boarding school, where they apparently don't have the internet. If this story sounds in any way like a bad episode of Dawson's Creek, you'd be right.
