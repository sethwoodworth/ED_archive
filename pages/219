'''Adam's Block''' is the name of a site run by a guy named Adam who lives a few stories above the Tenderloin, a fairly crimey neighborhood in [[San Francisco]]. Adam is a [[n00b]] in town. Adam <s>has</s> <B>HAD</B> two very good cameras streaming video, with sound, of the streets below, 24/7/365.

==The 'Loin==

The Tenderloin is a place where in the course of 15 minutes on any given night, you can buy some [[crack]], get a [[blowjob]] from a junkie tranny, step into someone's shit on the sidewalk, and order some [[Shit|Pho]] (noodles) at a [[Vietnam|Vietnamese]] restaurant. It is not a very nice part of town.

==Family style==

Yet for all its faults, the Tenderloin is a true microcosm of American culture. It is a melting pot for [[Philippines|boat people]], [[homeless]] people, [[whore]]s in any flavor, [[Negro]]es, classic [[police|kops]] and their fists-full of [[cake|donuts]], petty criminals, [[13 year old boys|juvenile delinquents]], and lost Alzheimer patients. The Tenderloin reflects U.S.A. culture like a mirror polished with methamphetamine residue and the shiniest expectorations of tuberculous [[alcoholic|alkies]]. The "Glide Memorial Church" is where all of the above congregate for a weekly dose of local white liberal guilt, and meatloaf.

==What you see?==

Adam's cameras capture all the amusing antics you might expect to see in such a place. It can be pretty boring for a while, but suddenly you may see a car's window get smashed in, or someone get mugged.

It also has a silly and fairly incoherent "chat" feature. There are signs, too, that Adam is beginning to take on an air of [[unwarranted self-importance]].

Still, it may be worth a look.

==Terminology==

*Crack Bush: A tree (lower left side of the screen) where [[bix nood|bix noods]] seem to put things for other [[bix nood|bix noods]] to retrieve. <s>The assumption is that it is crack.</s> [[fact|It's crack.]]

==Adam's Block Goes Off-Air==

[[Last_Thursday|Last Thursday]], Adam's Block went off the air due to death threats and supposed stalking. [[Pussy|Adam wrote an apology to those who threatened him]] and stopped recording.

Plans to make a new channel with multiple [[Webcam|web cams]] in various locations are about, but that's yet to play through.

==[[Put shoe on head]]==
