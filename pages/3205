{{quote|IMA THE GREAT LEGO BLADE WARRIOR, DANG IT!!!!!!!!!|The great [[fail|lego]] warrior, Ben Schroeder}}

'''gallantmon8''' (real name Benjamin Donald [[Chris-chan/People#Megan_Schroeder|Schroeder]]) is one of many [[deviantART|Tartlet]]s with a passion for a fictional character, being the [[fantard|#1 Lover]] of [[Imaginary girlfriend|Rosalina]], a fictional princess from ''[[Mario|Super Mario Galaxy]]'' who is nothing more than a [[SigurdHosenfeld|Peach]] [[recoloring|recolor]]. Taking these steps further than the usual horny teenager, he actually believes [[Loser|that Rosalina loves him as well]] and constantly requests pictures of her to other Tartlets. What differentiates him most is the fact that he's had [[Virgin|E-girlfriends]] who he broke up with due to [[masturbate|how focused he was]] on Rosalina.

By looking at Gallantmon8's name, you can also comprehend that he is a [[Digimon|Digifag]].

{{quote|24: Unusual things about you?

Gallant: Mah autism, I guess........|Bitch is autistic}}

==On deviantART==

[[Image:RosalinaxGallantmon8 Stamp by Lady Zelda of Hyrule.png|left|thumb|This [[DevianTART Stamps|stamp]] is one of his many requests, as a [[Shameless self promotion|teenager's horniness for a fictional princess needs to be acknowledged by others]].]]

Like many on the internet, gallant got his boost to fame from what he did as a [[deviantART|Tartlet]]. His gallery consists of [[MS Paint]] [[Talentless|skills]] maybe even worse than [[Chasethehedgehog]], blurry [[photography]], [[lego]]s, and screenshots of a [[Pok√©mon]] game and various websites. He has a [[Old meme|meme]] obsession, which includes him often using them as subjects for his [[Shitty art|art]] and saying "[[Falcon Punch|FALCON EDIT]]" instead of "edit",even though he haets ED and [[4chan]] with a deep, fiery passion. However, he became [[Internet celebrity|high-profile]] due to frequently [[Comments|commenting]] and [[Attention Whore|faving]] many pictures, usually of [[Nintendo]], memes, and even [[fat]] pictures.

Gallant pretends to be friends with seemingly any [[Mario]] fan who draws and takes advantage of this by requesting Rosalina pictures ([[Ship|often paired up with]] [[Gary Stu|himself]]), perhaps since his artistic capabilities are limited to scribbling. [http://www.deviantart.com/#order=9&q=gallantmon8 Searching "gallantmon8"] on dA brings up many results, and a large percentage of these are his requests. These pictures provide him with [[Masturbation|fapping]] material for the next few hours while he pretends to have sex with her in the comments of [[over 9000]] Rosalina pictures

Recently, gallant started a club [http://rxgm8-club.deviantart.com/ supporting him x Rosalina].

{{quote|1: How old are you?

Rosalina: Well, I'm actually around 21, but I like to think of myself as just about Gallant's age(16)

Gallant: Yup, 16!|Obviously, Rosalina, Queen of the fucking Galaxy [[pedophile|is 21 and thinks of herself as 16]]}}

His request whoring hasn't always worked smoothly. One such case was when he requested the usual "gallant with Rosalina" picture to {{deviantart|ChatRoyale|ChatRoyale}}, who was [[Skill|talented]] but was [[Italy|Italian]] and didn't have the best understanding of English. She interpreted the request as a picture of him with Peach, (understandably, considering Rosalina is Peach with a blue dress) thus drawing a picture of that. Instead of accepting the mistake and taking it as it is, [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/106495880/916956356 Gallant dealt with it immaturely and wanted it redone, which did occur.]

===Trolling===

[[Image:SMG Rosalina as a car by toyonda.jpg|right|thumb|[[Car]] [[transformation]] is an example of a Rosalina picture that goes past gallant's limit.]]
[[Image:Gallantcarreaction.png|right|thumb|His response to the car picture while others respond with truth. And because this isn't on his page, he can't hide the comments.]]

Like many Tartlets, gallant is swift to [[Delete fucking everything|hide]] comments that are negative or by trolls. While hidden comments were once able to be viewed by page source, unfortunately this is no longer true. As a result, screencapping is recommended when a troll comment is seen and not yet hidden, especially if gallant [[Internet drama|provides a reaction]]. [[YouTube]] trolling is still possible to see, even if it gets hidden.

|Wow you have to be the most [[Greedy|selfish]] person I've ever seen. My god what do you have shoved up your ass that makes you act like this? I'm being compleatly serious right now too, I've seen you be incredibly rude to people for not drawing you requests or not drawing requests how you want saying they "suck" or look like "crap" Are you that spoiled that you can't at least say "No thank you, maybe another time" You ask requests from EVERYONE and always get what you want, I'm truely suprised you haven't asked me for a request and [[Truth|I know the only reason you watched me was to get one]]. Seriously, it's amazing that you even have friends. Your friends care for you and it's so sad that you [[Ass|don't feel the same towards them]]. And if you do say "Yes I do care for them" Then answer me this "How?" You demand them to serve your every need and treat them like crap in this way in return. And I know either two things will happen out of this. You'll either Block me, hide this comment, and call me a troll for pointing out your faults, OR you will reply with a a [[DeviantART Iconsplz|plz account]] of some [[Old meme|overused meme]]. Which I find to be hilarious since you say you hate [[4chan]] so much, yet you use meme's from the site. You should be thankful that your friends want to play with you in the first place, you should be thankful that they still put up with you, that they draw you your silly little requests even though you're so rude to them.|TailzandBlueberry, deviantART

do you accept?|Frumpichoo, deviantART

|Wait...I think I'm missing the ART part of this ART TRADE. Because I don't really see any art in this at all, save for Peach's brooch.

==Elsewhere on the Internet==

[[Image:Gallantfaggotry.png|right|thumb|250px|So hardcore that he can't say faggotry without censoring it.]]

[[Image:Fail gallantmon is fail.PNG|right|thumb|250px|HONEST CRITICISM?! FAIL!!!]]

Besides dA, there are various places where gallant pops up at. On [[iScribble]], he occasionally collaborates with more talented people (throwing in his slop in the process) and posts the finished results on dA, possibly in an attempt to have comparatively decent art. He's also on [[Tegaki E]], where you can't collaborate on art so there's ONLY shit on his account.

[[Image:My_ID_by_gallantmon8.jpg|thumb|Dislikes being called [[gay]].]]

He uses [[YouTube]] and has awful, effortless videos there. A fan of [[YouTube Poop]], he's made Poops in [[Windows]] Movie Maker which repeat a [[LINK MAH BOIIIII|Zelda CD-i]] clip [[Asking for it|over and over]] while using different WMM special effects on the clips. Even lazier videos of his [[Backmasking|reverse]] music from games such as [[W|Donkey Kong]] and [[Banjo Kazooie]]. gallant himself appears in a recent video.

The newest community he now shows up at is [[Gaia Online]], but hasn't done anything that noteworthy there so far.

==His dA Relationships==

[[Image:Royal Horseplay by waluigis girl.png|left|thumb|300px|The [[Lucky Star]] picture in question.]]
[[Image:Illneverfindtruelove.png|right|thumb|Poor thing.]]

gallant, in spite of his arrogance, has somehow had E-girlfriends, although these relationships usually don't last long. His first was {{deviantart|supermariokoolgirl|supermariokoolgirl}}, who was at one point a [[Kirby|Meta-Knight]] fangirl. They went with the relationship for some time, gallant frequently [[Spam|posting his love for her and Rosalina on supermariokoolgirl's userpage]] and requesting several pictures of him with Rosalina from her. One controversy started in September 2008 when gallant commented on a [[:Image:Royal Horseplay by waluigis girl.png|picture]] by [[waluigis-girl]] that traced the [[original character]]s of gallant, smkg, and others over a [[Lucky Star]] picture. As smkg's character had a [[Hyper|cheerleader-like expression]], gallant commented that she might have had Meta-Knight [[buttsecks|up her butt]]. smkg did [[butthurt|not take this nicely]], so as a result gallant [[Emo|depressingly]] apologized and said that he'll always [[Lie|love her]] and Rosalina. Due to his focus on Rosalina, he stopped with the e-relationship sometime afterwards.

After he was done with smkg, he had a relationship with {{deviantart|DragonKazooie89|DragonKazooie89}}, also known as Heather. Heather was smarter than smkg, and merely tolerated gallant as he [[spam]]med his love on her userpage. Heather's tolerance dwindled and she [[Stfu|had it]] with gallant's obsessing. gallant finally learned that Heather had no romantic interest in him, so he [[BAWW|cried a river of tears]] on Rosalina Paradise, convinced that he'll be doomed to a life [[Virgin|without true love]]. On Tegaki E, he drew [http://www.unowen.net/tegaki/dblog.php?u=52132&e=720241 this gem] where he really did cry a river of tears for the same reason.

Now he's dating some [[fat]] [[emo]] slut named {{deviantart|Kartmaster|Kartmaster}}, [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/134710128/1179145610 who sends him Rosalina toys and doesn't know what sex is.]

===Real-Life Relationships===

Via deviantART notes, it's been confirmed that gallant has had various relationships [[IRL|in real life]]. These notes confirm [[Obvious|he's a virgin]].

== Reaction to this Article ==

<center>[[Image:Gallantsresponse.png]]</center>

With [[troll]]s around, it didn't take long until gallant was aware of this article.<s> He's already [[BAWW|whined about it]] with [[Engrish]]-esque comments such as "[[ALL CAPS|WHAT SICK MAN WRITE FAIL SATIRE ABOUT ME?]]"</s> Neg, [[obvious]] [[TF2]] reference is [[Obvious_troll_is_obvious|Extremely obvious]]... Either way he's still full of fail.

== [[Hate art|Fan Art]] ==

Although most art with gallantmon8 is requested by him, trolls draw him with [[hate|love]] on their own.
