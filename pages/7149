SF Drama
{{ljcomm|sf_drama}} is the off-topic [[LiveJournal]] [[community]] for [[Stupid free]]. Founded by [[Animal Dreams]] in August of 2007, the community quickly became a place for people to show off their [[n00dz]] and [[old meme]] knowledge.

The major difference between {{ljcomm|stupid_free}} and {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} is that the latter is totally cool with breaking LJ's [[TOS]], by linking to [[Friends only|friends-locked]] posts and personal journals. Also, {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} accepts posts that would be deemed [[fail]] even by {{ljcomm|stupid_free}}'s ridiculously lax standards. As a result, the quality of posts at {{ljcomm|stupid_free}} has improved somewhat, while {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} is inundated with random bullshit.

==General info==
After the drama between [[Animal Dreams]] and [[Mengus]] went down, the community went through several rapid changes of [[moderator|modship]] before settling on batshit [[bipolar]] [[goth]] {{lj|lucretia_lenore}}, [[bestiality|pitbull-fucker]] {{lj|bellasmommy}}, and conservative [[Pop parenting|LJ mom]] {{lj|merlyn4401}}.

Content is about 50% drama and 50% old-style e/n posts.

Update - 01/07/2011: After multiple [[epic]] and legendary wanks, our dearest {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} is left in the hands of the lone {{lj|madwitch}}.  For about a week now, she has been declaring that she will be dropping out and replacing herself with new mods.  Multiple posts she has stated she will make a mod post to discuss nominations.

It hasn't happened.

Many [[Retard|members]] are declaring it will be the end of the community.

Wish, and ye shall receive.

==IRC==
You can join the {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} users on irc.starchat.net #sf_drama. E-celebrities like [[minthoney]] occasionally show up, so don't miss it. #sf_drama has also been known to host a version of LJ [[internet court]].

==Theme days==
Yea, gone are the days of most what you see here.  Pic Posts and Frinkles have fallen to the wayside, and macros are sparse.  They will remain in honor of the Glory Days.

Members are too busy [[fapping]] to the injustices of the world and tearing one another apart for using [[cunt]], [[whore]], [[faggot]] and other insults that you are TOO WHITE AND TOO STRAIGHT AND TOO HETERONORMATIVE TO TALK TO.

You sound white.  Are you white, [[bitch]]?

'''Macro Mondays'''
Post a shit MS Paint version of a meme everyone's heard [[at least 100]] times!

''But don't let it feature death or a prostitute, or making fun of [[faggots]].''

===Off-Topic Tuesday===
Post questions that would belong in your personal journal, except you don't have enough friends to get any responses!

''Bonus points will be given if you off-topic about the [[retard]] you smashed the teeth of on the sidewalk for the [[lulz]] the day before.''

'''Pic Post Wednesdays'''
[[Camwhore]] your brains out!

''Thank God this [[shit]] is done with.  No one wants to see a bunch of [[faggots]] diddling themselves, or [[retards]] drooling on things, or [[niggers]].

'''Frinkle Fursday'''
Post a bunch of stupid [[fantard]] versions of a [[The Not-So-Great Frinkle Meme|decent meme]] that got overplayed!

==THE RIGHTEOUS==
===Preface===

{{ljcomm|sf_drama}} has become a rabid [[Retard|liberal]] playground, where any and every word is offensive by the standards of community members.  Considering more than 75% of all posts now feature glorious subjects like [[rape]] or [[murder]], the PC Brigade stands at the ready for one person to step out of line.  Once you say anything they denote is [[racist]], [[sexist]] or any other -ist, the post will break out into a fanatical melee of repeated debate that happened already two posts prior.  If readers are lucky.

===Day One===

We start here with a post titled [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3134611.html Grudgewank], courtesy of {{ljuser|californianight}}

Proving the community hivemind through example, californianight raged against {{ljuser|hotcoffeems}} for deciding she was a [[Negro]] after discovering she had a [[Negro]] for a relative like five fucking generations ago.  Declaring that a white person with fair hair and eyes simply cannot tout their [[black power]] privileges, sf_drama should come to back up californianight on her quest to bring down [[the man]].
[[Image:Watutalkinboutwillis.jpg|thumb|right|{{ljuser|californianight}} in her prime[[troll]]time]] 

However, it just didn't happen that way, and it only served to enrage the [[Negro]] & Company populace, leading to massive generalizations about the white race.  Because in sf_dramaland, racism is only that which is against all races but [[whitey]].


{{ljuser|itrytobeamused}}
:Why did you edit out things that would have been worthy of criticizing her for to instead do some disgusting racial identity policing

{{ljuser|californianight}}
:not surprised a white woman is hypersensitive about another white woman being allowed to pretend to be a person of color


While defending her statements through unnecessary amounts of editing and raging angry [[black woman]] rage, californianight takes the [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3134611.html?thread=579400851#t579400851 thread] with itrytobeamused as a call to arms.  Repeatedly through the post, she attempted to bait itrytobeamused by insulting her by her hair color and pale skin.  

Meanwhile, elsewhere in the post, a new [[meme]] is born.

* "You sound white."

But don't worry, everyone!  It's going to be okay, because white people deserve it.  So smd.

Multiple members call racial pohleecing.  This provokes the untalent of sf_drama's [[anon]] to go forth and screenshot multiple locked entries and post them over to [http://www.insanejournal.com insanejournal], found right [http://bestassholes.insanejournal.com/ here].

Flouncing commences.  The Social Justice Team activates their power of disappearing, baaaaaahleeting all their entries in the community.  Good thing they flounced, because that was against the rules anyway!

Among the fallen are:
* vulgarcriminal
* qweerdo
* flewellyn
* some [[an hero|serial deletist]] that people will always refer to her as s_v. sally_mclennane was her last name.  Is her last name.  fuck knows

Also, always remember if you're a black man walking into a racism war, you stfd and stfu because all you're doing is fucking [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3134611.html?thread=579452307#t579452307 mansplainin'].

===Day Two===
* [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3134738.html Capslock Friday] commences in good holiday spirits.
* Privilege is on debate [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3135214.html AGAIN] in some [[faggot]] community called {{ljcomm|linguaphiles}}
* [[Nazi]] [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3135476.html wank], on {{ljcomm|deleterius}}.  Despite the timestamp, it did come first.  Clearly {{ljuser|cogitoergoilusi}} is in [[rape|Japan]].

And then {{ljuser|stupify}} comes on the scene.  Submitting a post exclusively about [[ohnotheydidnt]] going on about Lady Gaga and her Illuminati Agenda, once {{ljuser|madwitch}} approved the post, she promptly editted to restir the mother fucking pot as she is another angry black woman (or so they say, but she sounds white), you don't know her, SHE CAN DO WHAT SHE WANTS

[http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3135519.html It was successful.]

===Day Three===
* [[Religion]] [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3135808.html wank] on {{ljcomm|ontd_political}}

===Day Four===
* Another one who lives in Japan, but that's okay, [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3136152.html The Queen is trying to bribe Australia]   Thank you, {{ljuser|new_perestroika}}.
* And fuck you, {{ljuser|sjaustin}} who is a female.  She proudly brings readers [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3136492.html welfare wank], a particularly sore subject for many sf_ders because they are deluded, angry hippies.

===Day Five===
* {{ljuser|onthetide}}, save us!!!!  ...oh, you just brought us [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3136736.html mental health wank], you goddamn [[cocksucker]].

===Day Six===

{{ljuser|morphine}} arrives to advise us that something terrible has happened.  {{ljuser|juliet316}} failed [[Trolling]] 101 and decided to hit up a gypsy chick with [http://community.livejournal.com/sf_drama/3137023.html multitudes] of dead gypsy images.  When {{ljuser|graspthethorn}} revealed the screenshot and IP of the anonfail attack, others came forward to advise that juliet316 was, in fact, the evil-doer.

Despite multiple sources citing apparently undocked images, juliet316 stuck to her guns and screamed before flouncing.  The links in the master post say so much.  Good job, [[shithead]].  gb24chon.

All participants were involved somewhere along the way since day one.  


==After The Days of Trauma==

Thus far, {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} has turned into a cesspool of Social Justice.  White, straight, hetertomanormativenta people, especially men, are not allowed to have opinions on anything.  Cis males, whateverthefuck that means.

Basically, the community remains one of [[srs bsns]], with [[hippies]] running about.  Members clearly have nothing better to do with their time other than to fap and slap.

Members will often cry that allies attempting to speak on behalf of [[pussy|marginalized]] groups are being bad allies and should go [[DIAF]], without realizing who might take offense to being told to [[DIAF]] because their mother/[[cat]]/father/cousin happened to have [[DIAF]].  The community seeks to sap all entertainment from human speech by finding everything cause to state someone is a [[racist]], sexist, homophobe, arachnophobe, basically anything-phobe.  If anyone of a "marginalized group" dare speak out to say that these individuals are being ridiculous, they too are told to shut up and are clearly lying.
[[Image:Middlefingernigra.gif|thumb|right|a reasonable [[nigra]] with something to say to {{ljcomm|sf_drama}}]] 
There are no girls on the internet.  In {{ljcomm|sf_drama}}, there are no colorededed peoples on the internet that would dare disagree with their [[batshit]] logic.

Members continue to rage about [[triggers]] not being placed on posts and more than half the active member population claims to be a victim of how they greet girls in [[rape|Japan]].  It is tempting for many sane members to tell them to turn off the goddamn computer and go to a mother fucking shrink.  Psychos.

==sf_drama All*Stars==
After the "Cool Kidz" ran off during the Liberalz Hunt 2011, a new array of stars have shown up!  So awesome to know who the people that aren't our future are.

{{ljuser|sjaustin}} -- {{ljuser|butterbuns}} -- {{ljuser|sunhawk}} -- {{ljuser|fucku}} -- {{ljuser|nesmith}} -- {{ljuser|alexandraerin}} -- {{ljuser|bloodparade}} -- {{ljuser|lost_garnet}} -- {{ljuser|winterfox}} -- {{ljuser|boomstick}} -- more new cool kids to come

==Quotes==

From time to time, there are real displays of how much {{ljcomm|sf_drama}} is the shining light of liberated thinking across the world of livejournal.

Such as when when {{ljuser|beardedtroll}} responded to wankercripple {{ljuser|gisei_nashi_ni}} at this [http://community.livejournal.com/bad_rpers_suck/7918424.html?thread=148023128#t148023128 sauce]:

{{quote|Ah, sf_drama. That glorious, hateful clique of confirmation-biased blind Internet wankers who're spending their days whipping each other into incestous, foam-mouthed rages over the least transgression of their self-drawn, self-validated lines in the sand. Truly they are the measure of all that is good and decent on the Internet in general and LiveJournal in particular. Truly they are their brothers' keepers, and truly they do see the specks in their brothers' eyes. Glory be!|keepin it reel bitches.}}
