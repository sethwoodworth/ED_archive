Metal Reviews
Metalreviews.com is the [[Heavy metal|Heavy Metal]] equivalent to [[livejournal]], with more drama than you can shake a flaming severed head at.

Every month or so (much like a woman's period), the drama levels grow like the a [[4chan]] user's dick everytime someone gets tentacle raped. The forum has been pronounced dead [[At least 100|at least 100 times]], only to rise again liek a BLAKK METVHL VAMPPYR!1!

== The Members ==
Metalreviews.com's members know eachother on a first name basis, and some of them even use endearing names like "honey" and "sweetie". It's a most lively bunch of internet [[Drama queen|Drama Queens]], including a Stone Cold lookalike (Mike), a would-be model (Jaden), a [[Homosexual|french guy]] (Stefan) and a bunch of drunk [[Europe|Europeans]]. There is also [[an hero]], Eyesore. Oddly enough, only one member is actually a [[16-year-old girl]].
