[http://www.modelmayhem.com ModelMayhem] is a [[web 2.0]] site for aspiring [[internet model]]s to network. 

The site's moderator thinks [[internets]] jokes are [[funny]], but he clearly fails to understand [[The Comprehensive Theory of Lulz]] since even the site's [[404]] message is [[unfunny]] [[I Can Has Cheezburger]] [[shit]]. 

[[Some argue]] ModelMayhem is [[serious business]] because your account has to be approved to join, but it's really just another place for [[gay]] camwhores to say "hAi gUIsE l00k @t mi [[cock]]!!!1"

The majority of the members are either [[16-year-old girls]] with [[unrealistic expectations]], [[fagolescence|fagolescents]], various [[camwhore]]s and [[internet celebrity|internet celebrities]], aspiring [[porn]] stars, and [[sick fuck]]s who masquerade as photographers just so models will get naked for them.

Nary a [[hott|Catherine McNeil]] or [[LOL WUT|Lily Cole]] or [[PCP|Sasha Pivovarova]] or [[Raptor Jesus|Lara Stone]] or [[hott|Magdalena Frackowiak]] for internet miles upon internet miles, though no one will ever give half a rat-shit about those smexXxXi, ACTUAL model chicks anyway: that's what ModelMayhem is all about.

The site's forums are full of [[lulz]] because it seems every [[woman]] on the site is having her [[period]] daily.

==Terminology==

[[Image:Gluttonsven.jpg|thumb|right|What the average GWC looks like in his free time.]]
[[Image:Mayhemmua.jpg|thumb|left|A typical MUA. [[Guess the Gender]]!]]

'''GWC''' - aka [[sick fuck]], stands for "guy with camera". These are normally [[old]] perverts who buy cameras, sign up on ModelMayhem, then trick young models into posing nude for them. Many often try to [[rape]] the models, then claim the model was [[asking for it]]. See [http://www.gwcmayhem.com] for [[moar]].

'''TFP/TFCD''' - "Time for print/Time for CD". These photoshoots are for models who trade their time with a photographer for prints or a CD of the images. Normally these involve [[n00dz]] because everybody on ModelMayhem is a [[sex]]-crazed fiend.

'''MUA''' - Make-Up Artist. In other words, "I have an excuse to be on here even though I'm ugly and will fuck anything that moves." These are often found [[lurk]]ing the forums.

'''Brigged''' - [[Banned]], but [[leftarded|politically correct]] for the [[fag]]s.

==Profiles==

===The [[16-year-old girl]] who wants to be a model===

[[Image:Modelmayhemcp.jpg|thumb|right|ModelMayhem GWCs liek to make [[CP]].]]
[[Image:Mmpron1.jpg|thumb|120px|left|"I wanna be a [[whore|legitimate model]]!!!1]]

These young, naive girls have no idea the [[goatse|horrors]] they are about to fall into when they sign up on the site. Within 2 years, when they are finally legal to do [[porn]] ([[CP|or often before then]]), they are pulled down into the world of [[niggerdick]]s, [[pegging]], [[buttsecks]], and [[2girls1cup]]. 

Most girls regret the outcome of this conversation later on in their lives about <s>becoming models</s> their voluntary descent into [[whore]]dom:

Girl: "Daddy, you'll still love me if I do it, right?"

Dad: "[[Pedo|Of course I will]]."

Of course, most of them end up getting [[STD]]s or becoming the next [[femse]]. Others scream they were [[rape]]d or [[almost raped]], and make [[over 9000]] dollars in the ensuing [[lolsuit]]s.

===The Fagolescent===

This guy is a [[buttsecks]] fiend, likely a [[furfag]], and more often than not has [[at least 100]] other various fetishes including but not limited to [[scat]], [[guro]], [[eproctophilia]], [[goatse|klismaphilia]], [[roman shower]]s, [[CP]], and being a [[transvestite]]. These models' portfolios are made up of [[n00dz]] and [[fail]]ed attempts at [[Kirk Johnson]]'s glorious masterpiece. 

Some also like to make other sorts of [[shock image]]s. Of course, many are [[banned|brigged]], others die of [[AIDS]], and the rest commit [[suicide]].

===[[Camwhore]]s and Internet Celebrities===

[[Fact|Every internet celebrity wants to be a model]]. However, most are too [[fugly]], but that is insignificant and is drowned out by their sense of [[unwarranted self-importance]]. They normally become [[friendwhore]]s and engage in [[fail]]ed acts of [[shameless self-promotion]], while further proving how [[internet disease]]-ridden they are. Known profile holders include [[jeffreestar]], [[gaygod]], [[audreykitching]],[[diageoliam]] and [[stevieryan]].

===Aspiring Porn Stars===

[[Image:MM_Silicone_Upgrade.jpg|thumb|right|"Sup MM cum check out my new pixs!!!1"]]

[[Belladonna]] likely got her break through ModelMayhem, as did [[Gay God]]. Since everybody on ModelMayhem is a pervert, what better place for people to show their goods to the world? (uhh, [[RedTube]], lol). 

Since these models try to shy away from web 2.0 porn sites that are officially pornographic, they resort to uploading n00dz onto ModelMayhem to try to get some [[attention]]. Some have even received offers of [[at least 100|1500 or more]] dollars to do a video [[fap]]ping on camera, even [[moar]] for actual [[buttsecks]]. 

Of course, people on ModelMayhem, being the whores they are, leap at the opportunity.

Recently ModelMayhem has been cracking down on porn sites, or pornographically themed adds and models.  This has caused a massive amount of butthurt, especially in the [[Alt-Porn]] community.  Any and all porn is bad... except for [[Suicide Girls]]. Pictures of [[boner]]s, as well as [[femse|vaginal]] and [[goatse|anal spread shots]] are also not allowed.

==The Forums==

[[Image:Mmemofaggotry.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emo]] faggotry is widespread on the ModelMayhem forums.]]
[[Image:Modelmayhemfurfaggotry.jpg|thumb|right|[[Furfaggotry|What you are likely to see in the majority of ModelMayhem portfolios]].]]

ModelMayhem's forums are full of [[drama]]. The moderators are rather [[anal]] about the [[TOS]], and the sick fuck GWCs are not happy about this. They all get [[banned]], then they [[Jesus Christ|come back]].

Other sources of drama in the forums include models getting [[butthurt]] about doing n00dz, GWCs [[BAWWW]]ing about models not wanting to do n00dz or [[women]] taking their boyfriends with them to shoots, women complaining about [[shit nobody cares about|female problems]], and [[bullshit|why it's so hard to be a model]].

Mention the fact that there are more [[nigra]] male models than any other race to spark an instant [[flame war]].

Better yet, do as [[Mission: MySpace]] did and be an outspoken [[internet humanitarian]]. This will cause extreme butthurt among GWCs, and will result in [[lulz]] for all those who witness the act of [[troll]]ing and understand it was done entirely [[for the lulz]].

The easiest way to troll a GWC is to defend models who insist that they should be allowed to take a friend or boyfriend with them to a shoot.  The GWCs get insulted at the notion of having another cock anywhere near them when there is naked wimmins about.

It is estimated that approximatively 10% to 15% of members are actually photographers or models at all, the majority are Jr High Schoolers who have joined only in order to see nekkid pics and say stupid shit in the threads. Also note that the average attention span of the typical MM member is about 3 posts so, if it is your intent to set them straight you will have to do it quickly and repeatedly before you are banned.

==[[Anonymous]] and ModelMayhem==

[[At least 100 years ago]], [[4chan]] [[b|/b/]] carried out a [[DDoS]] attack against ModelMayhem. Other than that, ModelMayhem members seem to be oblivious to the concept of [[lulz]], or to the true nature of the [[internet hate machine]].

==How to Get On ModelMayhem==

Here is a [[copypasta]]-esque bio if you want to make it through ModelMayhem's approval queue for new accounts. (Gaize, they take trolling [[srs]]!)

<blockquote>I'm [[newfag|new to modeling]], just figured I'd give it a try after some friends [[DO IT FAGGOT|recommended it]]. I'm just [[Histrionic personality disorder|trying to get my face out there]] and get some photoshoots in to pay off my student loans, and see [[porn|where else it takes me]].</blockquote>

[[Great justice]] must be done. Are [[you]] up for it?
