RPG Maker
A program made for wishful thinking nerds who have dreams of getting into the video game industry, RPGmaker helps you create shit games that *might* have been up to par with graphics that were state of the art in 1991.  Approximately 99.998[[%]] of the so called "games" created by RPGmaker are half-finished, almost all use sprites stolen from [[Final Fantasy VI]] and the plot is just a carbon copy of Final Fantasy III- you'd actually be surprised .  A while back, some [[wapanese]] dick released a [[Dragonball Z]] sprite pack, causing much more shit games that clog the [[tubes]].  <s>It should also be noted that you need to install the software to run '''any''' game created in RPG Maker. What a load of shit.</s> [[Nerd|Only 90% true. If you include any necessary RTP resources and configure the ini file correctly, RPG Maker games can run on any computer.]] However, most game authors are retarded and don't consider that this might be a good idea.

==History==

Originally released in [[Japan]] as "RPG Maker 95", some [[wapanese]] dork by the name of Don Miguel found RPG Maker 2000 (a.k.a RM2K) and translated it into English. Once this happened, everyone  who thought they could make a game pretended to. The games were then all erased by the amazing magic of [[Windows]].

Don Miguel's site closed down for a while but came back for some reason; the site still only supported RM2K and RM95, probably because he's a stupid fuck.

[[At least 100|A few years ago,]] a version of RPGmaker was released on the [[Playstation]]; the entire gameplay consisted of the thrill of making an RPG that only you can play!  Also, if you wanted to share/sell it with your friends you needed to obey the legal disclaimer, which stated that you had to pixel draw every bit of the RPG in order to do so.  Until [[Virginia Tech massacre|recently]], this caused more deaths than Korean [[world of warcraft|WOW]] gamers.
===2000/2003===
Nobody gives half a shit about RPG Maker 2000, or it's nigger half-brother 2003, and nobody should.
===XP===
Apparentlty, the people at Enterbrain have absolutely no idea that XP is an [[emoticon]], and so decided to name their next RPG Maker XP. This introduced the concept of "coding", where you could actually edit some parts of the source code of the program. This was a huge revelation to the RPG Maker community. Suddenly, everybody could actually make the [[Legend of Zelda|LoZ]]-[[Shit Nobody Cares About|Secrets of Mana]]-[[Final Fantasy]] [[crossover]] game they'd always wanted, if they bothered to learn to code. But wait a second, if you've got to learn to program to do it, why waste you're money on an RPG Maker? Why not learn to program, and make you're game from scratch?
===VX===
More of the same. As of July 2010, this is the latest and probably best RPG Maker available. A wide variety of scripts also exist, because generous coders with [[basement dweller|no lives]] have sprung up to capitalize on the massive amount of n00bs willing to give blowjobs for scripts like flies capitalizing on an infinite well of [[shit]].
Some half-decent games have been made with this, but they will always and forever be drowned out in a constant outpouring of half-finished horrifyingly badly done Final Fantasy/Kingdom Hearts/Some other shitty [[azn]] game remakes that aren't worth their weight in [[cunt]].
===Other Makers===
Enterbrain also produced some RPG maker games for the PS2- don't buy these, no matter what you do, ever. Doing so is a sign of servere [[retard|mongoloidism]].
Enterbrain also produced a fighting game maker. [[MUGEN]] is better. Yes, you read that correctly. MUGEN is actually better than something.
Enterbrain also produced something called "Indy Game Maker". It is exactly as shitty as it sounds. Game Maker is better.
See a pattern here?
