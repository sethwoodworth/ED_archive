YouTube Furry War
[[Image:Atlas ruining furries by flyingdebris.jpg|thumb|The trolling soon exploded into an all-out conflict]]
The '''Youtube Furry War''' was a period of anti [[furry]] trolling on YouTube. Starting in 2007 as a result of furry [[butthurt|indignation]] at the fact that they had become [[lolcows|the butt of many a joke]] at the hands of trolls and [[mundane]]s alike, furries assumed a stern word and a show of defiance would [[fail|quell the mockery]]. The results surprised them, and would be remembered for years to come as [[9/11|one of the greatest tragedies to ever strike the fandom]]. Until [[Chewfox]].

==Declaration==
[[Image:FuckingFurries.jpg|thumb|Agreed.]]
According to [[shit nobody cares about|various sources]], furries had been on edge as a result of years of furry mockery over decades, from the trolls of [[DeviantArt]] to the cruel taunts of the [[media|mainstream press]].

For most, the fact that [[Animu|any]] [[emo|group]] [[Jews|is]] [[Fags|always]] [[Niggers|fair]] [[Scientology|game]] on the internet comes as no surprise. However, being furries, their natural persecution complex kicked into full gear, of [[BAW|cries of injustice]] rang far and loud. This [[faggotry|righteous fury]] struck a chord and prompted a headstrong [[SokiTwopaw]] to give his notorious "Ultimatum Declaratum", a battlecry for furries across the internet to stand up and declare equality and respect from the world that belittled them so. This would be the first in a long line of mistakes.

==War is [[Lulz|Hell]]==
Reaction to Soki's video was [[Rape|swift and brutal]], with trolls doxing and raiding him in less than 3 days from discovery of the video. Regardless, his call to arms was headed, with furry after furry making their own protest video and flooding troll channels ready to battle the internet hate machine. Most action was seen in the comment boxes and user profiles of Furry and troll, with yiff in hells and empty death threats as far as the eye could see. During the onslaught, the original incarnation of the [[FCTC]] took it upon themselves to [[phish]] [[retarded|unsuspecting]] furries and raid forums in response to the overwhelming faggotry displayed by the fandom. In the thick of battle, some furs saw a shining opportunity for [[Internet celebrity|respect to be gained]] from the community, declaring themselves defenders of the fandom and [[Spider expert|professional troll exterminators]]. The most infamous include;

===[[Silentwulf]]===
As the war kicked off, [[loser|furry celebrity]] Silentwulf took Soki's advice to push his fetish pride in the face of the unsuspecting public to heart. Taking a break from making [[Unfunny|hilarious]] videos to [[propaganda|"the myths and facts about being a furry"]] coupled with his [[retarded|unique brand]] of humor, which resulted in every furry on the internet [[fellatio|hailing him as their savior]], as well as catching the attention of [[Anonymous]]. The end result was a total raid against Silentwulf [[Win|while he was moving into his new home]]. His Youtube profile, [[MySpace]], and email accounts were snatched out from under him as he was distracted with perfection his patented style of [[Family Guy|random humor]], and as a result was thoroughly raped with minimal resistance. Silentwulf was eventually forced to a new Youtube, where he refused to take part in any subsequent anti-troll action, however his defeat was a golden ticket to furry [[islam|martyrdom]].

===[[Tori Belliachi]]===

Another of the more successful attempts was that of 16 year old Tori Belliachi. In August of 2007, Tori, then an unknown editor of one of thousands of websites, thought it wise to spend his spare time posting video warning the public for the [[Win|evils]] of [[fursecution]]. Initially claiming he would disprove any and every accusation the trolls could throw at him and the fandom at large, Tori made [[lame|brave]] steps to defend his community. For example, when accused of being a furry faggot, his immediate response was to [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL5S-fOBG9o throw himself into a pile of other men and roll around on his bedroom floor giggling]. Such videos immediatly made him the furries shining hope in the midst of the war, with most furries simply spouting [[TL;DR|"Watch Tori's videos!]]" when asked to defend their stances.

Later in that same month Tori ceased making videos, citing "[[Ragequit|no good arguments were being made against him]]". Tori declared victory on behalf of the furry fandom, and retreated to his LiveJournal and various furry projects. The furries initially celebrated, only to realize that, despite Belliachi's [[Over 9000|plethora]] of videos, they were still being mocked. Another Furry Jesus had failed them.

===[[Lulz in hell Trollfags]]===
[[Image:Lulzfail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Facepalm|"This'll show them who the psychotic freaks are!"]]]]
Opting for a militant approach over Belliachi's Furry Guru gimmick, Lulz in Hell Trollfags spent his days during the Furry War hopping from troll account to troll account plastering death threats and other [[batshit|assorted mantra]]. His most important contribution to the war front was an incredibly [[Art|poorly drawn]] video in which the menacing face of a teddybear proceeds to execute an [[Holocaust|emaciated Jew]] for the crime of fursecution, promising the viewer this is a serious threat that he intends to carry out.

LIHT eventually decided he would fight fire with fire and [[srsly|troll the trolls]]. Assuming he had obtained a high profile trolls phone number and address, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoizVJuNhl0 LIHT proceeded to call and harass the individual repeatedly], touting his victory that the troll was too scared to face him. Unfortunately for him, he had actually been [[trolled|dooped into doxing another furry]]. Upon being informed that he himself had also been dox'd and was now vulnerable to [[V&|very real legal consequences]] for the repeated death threats he had sent, Lulz in Hell Trollfags disappeared from the war.

===[[WolfAdvocate]]===
[[Image:Wolfface.jpg|thumb|right]]
One of the staunchest defenders of the Furrys/Otherkins, WolfAdvocate (aliases CanisLupusSapien/WrathofCanis/WiseWolf87) could be found on any number of Furry videos, using [[Lie|logic]] to combat the trolls, usually frequenting the channels of younger otherkins, such as [[Hatedwerewolf]], 2whitetiger6, and any other pre-teen dumb shit willing to accept his [[Pedophilia|protection]]. Despite claiming [[Fact|to do a bit of research before opening his mouth]], he has been [[Pwnt|outwitted]] on numerous occasions, whipping out his [[LOL WUT|facts]] only to be bitchslapped  by anyone bearing the truth. This happened enough times for him to get [[butthurt]] and abandon his CanisLupusSapien channel entirely. However, because of his intense need to [[molest|protect]] various otherkin, has been tracked down, <s>and can be found [http://youtube.com/user/WiseWolf87 here]. Feel free to [[troll|visit]] him and drop him a note letting him know what you think of him as a [[Pedobear|protector]].</s> BALEETED

While trying his best to gain support from furries, Crygus revealed not only do Furries think of retarded animals to live through, but also confirmed the longstanding [[Fact|belief]] that Furries are [[Basement-dweller|basement-dwellers]] and do in fact shot their load thinking of big, burly animals, no matter how many times a Furry will plead otherwise.

==[[George W. Bush|Mission Accomplished]]==

Near the end of the year, trolls had grown tired of the redundant reactions and declared victory, citing that they had obtained their [[Lulz|most coveted war trophy]] long since then. The furries, [[Not|unsurprisingly]], remain oblivious to their surroundings, and claim the furry war is raging as strong as ever. [[Slowpoke|3 years after the fact]].

You see that mixed with abuse ranging from sexual abuse, to physical abuse, and mental abuse you all can see this leaves a twisted and demented shell of a person that needs to be removed from society.
