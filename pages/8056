[[Ted Haggard]] [[At least 100 years ago|once]] was the leader of the [[NAMBLA|National Association of Evangelicals]] and is [[Lie|TOTALLY STRAIGHT GOD DAMNIT]]! Haggard is a popular evangelical pastor at the New Life [[Church]] in Colorado Springs, [[Colorado]], as well as a member of [[republican|Jesus’ political party]].  Despite this, [[HAGGER|Haggard]] hired a predatory [[homosexual]] [[prostitute]] into having mindblowing [[buttsecks]] while snorting massive mounds of [[drugs|methamphetamine]].

== [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|It Was All Just a Misunderstanding]] ==

[[Last Thursday]], Haggard released a [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15536263/ statement] admitting it was true that he got [[hookers and blow]] on a regular basis. But there was a [[bullshit|perfectly reasonable explanation]]!!![[oneoneone|111]]  He only bought the meth to [[smoke|“tempt” himself]].  As for the gay [[whore]], he was just giving Pastor Ted a [[Blowjob|massage]], not a hardcore ass-drilling with a creamy [[cum|gut shake]]. When asked to comment on this explanation, a spokesman for the [[Internets]] said “[[LOL]]”.

He was outed by his gay, drug dealing hooker, Mike Jones. Jones said he had only recently learned of Haggard's true identity, and explained his reasons for coming forward by saying, "It was for teh [[lulz]]."

If you’ve ever wanted to see an evangelical leader be forced to deny to the world that he’s had gay sex with a hooker and enjoys using speed while his wife sits right next to him, [http://wm.kusa.gannett.edgestreams.net/news/1162580559552-11-03-06-haggard-interview-.wmv well, this is just your lucky day, isn't it?] LOL, [[Jesus]].

== Except, It Was Not All Just a Misunderstanding ==

On Sunday, November 5, [[2006]], Ted Haggard [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/11/05/national/a092452S11.DTL released a statement] confirming not only that he is an active crystal queen, but that he prefers it at least eleven inches deep in his ass. The [[twink]] population of Denver proceeded to [[epilepsy|shiver]] and [[vomit]] in fear, as it is only a matter of time before Ted comes a lookin’.

On Tuesday, February 6, [[2007]], Tim Ralph (Haggard's anti-gay counselor) announced in [http://www.denverpost.com/ci_5164921 The Denver Post] that [[Jesus|Baby Jesus]] had performed a miracle and removed all signs of [[faggotry]] and [[penis|pen0r]] from Haggard's [[ass|life]] and he was [[Ex-Gay|100% cured]] and -thus- [[not gay|"completely heterosexual".]] Only not. Thus forming the colloquialism, "Ted Haggard straight". 

Ralph later said what he meant to say that the therapy [[lie|"gave Ted the tools to help to embrace his heterosexual side."]]

You can now [[Gambling|place bets]] on when he'll be caught in a [[Chicago]] steamroom at [http://www.betonted.com BetOnTed.com.] [[User:Tfo|Tfo]] is betting early, and often.

Despite the fact that his former employers, the New Life Church, [[LOL WUT|agreed to pay his $138K salary through 2007]], Haggard has issued his former flock a letter ( August 2007 ) begging that they [[donate]] to support him, for which he promises that they be will "rewarded in [[heaven]]". You can see the full [[TL;DR]] letter [http://joemygod.blogspot.com/search/label/Ted%20Haggard here].

{{squote|If people want to support us directly, they can mail checks to Ted and Gayle Haggard, 9699 N. Hayden, Suite 108, PMB 180, Scottsdale, AZ 95259. This is a private mail box address that we have been using since we moved to the Phoenix area. If any supporters need a tax deduction for their gift, they can mail it to Families With a Mission at P.O. Box 63125, Colorado Springs, CO 80962. The supporters would need to write their check to "Families With A Mission" and put a separate note on it that it is for the Haggard family, then Families With a Mission will mail us 90[[%]] of the funds for support and use 10% for administrative costs.

Thank you so much. We feel our move into the "Dream Center" is the next step God would have us take. Any help we can get with this will be greatly appreciated and, I believe, rewarded in heaven.|Haggard}}

Ted and his wife NEED this support because they are going back to school for two years to get master's degrees in Counseling. Which school, you may wonder? It's America's leading fake university, the e-school called [[University of Phoenix]].

=== Run By [[Pedo]] ===
[[Image:HubertyRegister.jpg|thumb|The original cast of Jackass.]]
The charity that Ted Haggard directed his former flock to donate to on his behalf, Families With A Mission, was "[[pwned|voluntarily dissolved]]" in February of this year and the "[[Pedobear|registered agent]]" of the charity, Paul Huberty, is a registered sex offender in [[Hawaii]] and was previously arrested for having [[sex]] with a [[16 year old girl|17 year-old female]] in his care. This is the guy who gets 10% of the donations for "[[hookers and blow|administrative costs]]". [[lulz]]



=== [[Banhammer|Banhammered]] ===
Once his old church found out about the note he sent they got fucking ''pissed.

''Disgraced pastor Ted Haggard won’t be fundraising for a Monument nonprofit run by a sex offender, won’t be ministering to anyone and [[nigra|needs to get a job]], his [[Cthulhu|overseers]] said in a statement released this afternoon.

“Mr. Haggard’s solicitation for personal support was [[desperate|inappropriate]],” his [[Cthulhu|church supervisors]] said in the statement.

This outcome, and its national attention in the [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/29/AR2007082902085.html?hpid=sec-religion Washington Post] caused the famous [[Fag]] that is destroying our [[loli|children]] [[Dan Savage]] to [http://slog.thestranger.com/2007/08/overseers_to_haggard_get_a_job 2 proudly announce] "[[I_came |I CAME]], right in the pope's eye."
