'''Bananadine''' is a mythical [[drug]] that can be extracted from the skins of bananas. 


First described in the "[[Anarchy|Anarchist's]] Cookbook" [[at least 100 years ago]], banana peels as a way to get high has been a too long-standing joke - in fact it's so much of a well known myth in druggie communities, that it rarely ever manages to generate any [[lulz]], unless a newbie [[fucktard]] sets himself as a target by hesitatingly asking about bananas getting you high. If you're lucky enough to meet such an ignorant [[fucktard]] on a drug forum , be sure to [[troll]] the shit out of him.


==Recent research==
[[Some argue]] that new [http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/5856224 scientific research] on bananas is on the way and they indeed can be cooked into something that blows your [[crap|brain]] out.

==Ways to troll IRL==
[[Interwebz]] illiterate druggies are too old to not know the banana tale as Anarchist's cook book was invented befoar the internets - on the other hand a younger druggie so fucktard who hasn't heard of this will probably have [[death|OD'ed]] by now.  One trick, which also gets you lots of free bananas to eat is spotting a junky with no junk contact and convince him that [[bullshit|this shit]] really works, but you just don't have any money.
