[[Image:A_Game_of_Pretend.png|thumb|The gist of it.]]

'''A Game of Pretend''', also known as '''pretend [[sex]]''' or '''love''', refers to seeking [[buttsex]] under the guise of only "[[Faggotry|pretending]] to be gay".

Numerous images have been drawn depicting this behavior, generally involving two males, one of which is feminine, the other either normal, strong or [[fat]]. The feminine male strongly suggests that he would pretend to be a girl for the other male, if he wanted it.

[[Some argue]] that the "pretend" in the name of the [[meme]] could refer to the lengthy period of denial one would go through afterwards, where they pretend that they are [[not gay|still straight]]. However, even though balls did not touch, [[you]] are still [[gay]].
