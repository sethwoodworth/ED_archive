[[Image:Ayman aka Alec Difrawi.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]
'''Alec Difrawi''' is a successful [[Egyptian]] Jew living and operating in Orlando, [[Florida]]. He is highly respected as a small-time crook, and likely chose the scamshine state (after he was banned from doing business in [[Illinois]]) due to its tolerance for people filling the internet with crap. 

He has been ruthlessly attacked online by disgruntled former employees, [[419_Nigerian_Email_Scams|competitors]], [[Anonymous|internet terrorists]], [[Anti-semite|conspiracy theorists]], extortionists and random [[basement-dwelling]] nerds with [[No_Life|nothing better to do]]. [[Clearly]], anything written about Difrawi or his legitimate businesses is [[defamation]] and deserves immediate [[legal action]]. 

Difrawi has a long history of valiantly and fearlessly fighting against [[moralfags]] who seem to assault him at every turn by pointing out his previous [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|convictions for fraud, arrest for child abuse, involvement in modelling/employment scams]] and many other details that became irrelevant five minutes after they happened. 

Like most other legitimate businessmen he likes to go under several different names. Alec Difrawi seems to be his preference for the moment, but he has also been known as various combinations of Alec Defrawy, Michael Defrawy, Ayman El-Difrawi, Ayman A. El-Difrawi, Ayman Ahmed El-Difrawi and Defendant.

== Difrawi For Congress! ==

[[Image:StopInternetPolice.png|thumb|right|One possible reason his campaign failed: [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/22076918.html?dids=22076918:22076918&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+12%2C+1996&author=&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=B.08&desc=Man+Gets+Four+Years+in+Fraud+Case]]]

Back in '05, Difrawi ran for congress trying to reform the [[internets]] so he could finally run his businesses in peace. The idea was to require any random idiot posting anything anywhere to provide complete [[dox]] so that he would have less trouble throwing harassing [[lawsuits]] at them. The e-lectorate welcomed him with open arms and many still can not comprehend why he isn't president today instead of the [[President_Barack_Hussein_Obama|black person]]. 

Some quotes from the campaign:

{{quote|The World Wide Web has become the Wild, Wild West|Crappy campaign slogan. And there's still a serious lack of giant mechanical spiders here. }}

{{quote|How does the bill work? Anyone creating a site or posting on a message board must provide a valid and verifiable name, address and phone number. That’s all there is to it. Simple, yet effective. Cyberbullies will think twice about spewing possible slander if they know their words can be traced.|[http://web.archive.org/web/20051130014727/http://www.difrawiinternetreform.com/ Defining] himself as the arch-enemy of [[trolls]] everywhere.}}

Some [http://www.youngentrepreneur.com/forum/f2-general-business/difrawi-champions-internet-reform-act-4768.html reactions]:

{{quote|ever read the book "[[1984]]" - that is what the above reads like|<s>Spontaneous and insightful</s> [[Obvious troll]] and clearly libelous reaction to Difrawi's campaign}}

{{quote|How would you even enforce this? First of all congress can only pass federal laws in the US, not the world. This means two things, the rest of the world wouldnt need to adhere to these rules, and secondly...americans can just use non-US website hosts and as such avoid this legislation. |Difrawi argues why he needs to be world president}}

{{quote|...the majority of Americans using the internet can tell the difference between a reputable news source and trolls spewing garbage on a message board|Member of the electorate proving himself wrong}}

'''DIFRAWI FOR CONGRESS''' - Jew people need privacy too. Hiding your identity when running a corporation should be a civil right. 

'''DIFRAWI FOR CONGRESS''' - [[You|Poor]] people who post their stupid opinions on the internet should be required by law to provide their [[dox]] so I can sue them. 

'''DIFRAWI FOR CONGRESS''' - I'm in marketing, so you '''know''' you can '''trust''' me.

'''Campaigning [[PROTIP]]:''' Try not to get jailed for fraud.

== Completely Irrelevant History ==

[[Image:Trustedjew.jpg|thumb|right|It was the Jew's fault, honestly.]]

Long ago, he founded the largest internet modelling company in the world, but had to leave it only because it was exposed in national media as one of the largest frauds in history and his associate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Pearlman Lou Pearlman] (actual [[kike]]) ended up [[banned IRL]]. 

He then moved on to something called Internet Solutions Corporation running a bunch of job boards under a few different company names, going just fine before those misguided idiots in the local media and Washington Post picked up on it, and random people started attacking him for no reason again. So he had to defend himself. Several [[factual]] sites were set up to tell the truth, one for example [http://web.archive.org/web/20070212115047/http://www.thetruthaboutusavoice.com/ here].

{{quote|Today most companies of any significance are the target of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|hate or attack sites]] engaged in posting derogatory reports for the purpose of harming the business.

{{quote|USAVoice has never been the subject of any complaint to any Better Business Bureau|Washington DC [http://www.dc.bbb.org/ doesn't count]. }}

[[Image:Tinfoilhatmodel.jpg|thumb|right|Tinfoil hats - effective pacifier even against Russian hackers. Mind control rays still go straight through it.]]
To counter the Washington Post writings, they released a [[TL;DR]] [http://www.zimbio.com/The+Washington+Post/articles/2/CONNED+WorldVoice+Responds+Washington+Post brilliant analysis] of how a Russian extortionist tricked the Washington Post into writing lies about Difrawi companies. All true - it's a [[conspiracy]], kids.  

He actually launched IRL [[lawsuits]] against several [[bloggers]] and anonymous forum posters, not going so well, at least one of those got [[pwned]] for being frivolous [[bullshit]]. [http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/internet-solutions-v-garga-richardson-2nd-lawsuit Srsly]. The internet terrorists have taken over the [[California]] court system now. 

Difrawi has, after these hard-fought battles and e-learnings, assembled his own personal [[Internet Hate Machine]] to shut up anyone and anything that you DO NOT want to fuck with (without the usual [[7 proxies]] at least). Despite the glorious struggle he eventually gave up and applied the commonly accepted business practice of [[delete fucking everything]] so he could start it up under a different name and pretend he's not running it. 

{{quote|ISC was forced to abandon and no longer use ISC owned websites referenced on [hate site] and ISC expended substantial sums establishing and creating new internet sites to operate its business|[[Bawwwww]]}}

{{quote|Difrawi has no relation whatsoever to Three Stars Media|Difrawi's new puppet CEO/[[lawyer]]}}

Since then he's been running [http://www.threestarsinc.com Three Stars Media] behind the scenes, not admitting to that fact until his tormentors in the local media [http://www.wftv.com/news/19970193/detail.html once again] caught up with him. But he is now running a perfectly [[Oxymoron|honest marketing company]] that is utterly undeserving of being targeted by any misguided [[moralfags]] bent on exposing past acts of [[faggotry]].

== Difrawi Hate Machine In Operation ==

When Difrawi's usual array of friendly phone calls and legal threats fail to get crap deleted, he has no option but to resort to more serious measures. Obviously any site that allows anyone to post is responsible for the actions of those posters, right? And obviously when a business is lied about on a public forum no one can blame them for lowering themselves to the level of any random person who dared voice his opinion, right? [[Awwright]]!
[[image:DifrawiProxy.JPG|thumb|Another Difrawi web [[proxy]] [[fail]]. Remember kids, only use them to get past firewalls at school, never to cover your tracks]]
So when all of Difrawi's sites got blacklisted on the Web of Trust for useless phishing rather than job opportunities, thanks to the actions of some troll bent on defaming and spreading lies about Difrawi, [http://mywotscam.com/ doing the same] against Web of Trust was [[fucked up|the reasonable response]]. 

However this time he forgot about the standard company practice of staying behind [[7 proxies]] when defaming other companies.

== The Difrawi Project ==
[[Image:difrawi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|"I am not a crook"]]
An anonymous "colleague" of Difrawi is [http://www.alecdifrawiproject.com/ here] trying to claim that he is in fact an honest legitimate businessman and not just a typical con artist in serious denial of being a crook. This is quite extraordinary since it has only happened 65 times since he was let out of prison. 

{{quote|For too long the wrong people have controlled the dialogue on the internet about Alec Difrawi.|Despite our attempts to sue them into oblivion}}

And did you know that the only bad thing Alec ever did was that little "white collar crime" (meaning it wasn't really very serious) that landed him in prison? This is more closely described on [http://www.difrawiconsulting.com/story-3.php difrawiconsulting.com], compared to a little white lie that he forged his fathers signature to obtain a bank account for his business. Lets just forget to mention that this wasn't the only bank account he tried to obtain with fraudulent information, that this wasn't the only piece of bullshit on the application, that he was ripping people off by promising things he could not deliver, and was forced to pay $2 million in restitution to his victims [https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B8Bq331A40ZlYTM0NmY0NjctZjk0YS00ZTBkLWJiNTUtM2QxZjQyZDM5MDYy&hl=en] [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/22076918.html?dids=22076918:22076918&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Mar+12%2C+1996&author=&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&edition=&startpage=B.08&desc=Man+Gets+Four+Years+in+Fraud+Case]. 

But he really has changed since then and learned his lesson. Let us also forget to mention that all the companies he's run since then, for example [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-10-05/news/0310050128_1_lou-pearlman-scouting-network-wilhelmina-scouting Wilhelmina Scouting Network], [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901925.html USA Voice], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RN-MfY9EUE Three Stars Media] and [http://www.wftv.com/video/22318192/index.html The Internet Company] have been exposed in mainstream media as scams. 

{{quote|A lot has been written about Alec Difrawi. A lot. So much so that you have to wonder: why? What has he done to generate so much attention?}}

Yes, why? Here are a few possibilities:

* He runs useless job boards with postings copied from legitimate job boards just so he can get people's personal details to sell to marketing companies. 
* He has in the past taken part in far nastier modelling/loan/employment advance fee scams. 
* Despite that he has spent his entire life inventing new scams, he tries to defend himself as if he's in any sense respectable. 
* He files [http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/difrawi-v-henderson lawsuits] against dozens of random IPs and consumer advocates who say anything bad about him even when it's backed up by a frikkin' Washington Post article. 
* He is not an exception to the [[Streisand Effect]]. Every time you succeed in deleting something, another ten idiots will spread it even further. 
* He claims to have changed for the better, but at best he seems to have learned how to stay out of prison while running his shady schemes. 
* He's a sociopathic con artist who doesn't know when to quit.

{{quote|what speaks volumes about Alec is that despite the constant attacks he continues to create jobs and do everything he can to make people’s lives better. That he hasn’t given in to the negativity.}}

Newsflash: According to some PR people Difrawi has employed, being a scumbag is now a good thing, as long as you don't show any remorse, keep acting like a scumbag and employ others to do the same.

== The Bad Boy of Marketing ==

{{quote|The bad boy of marketing had grown up.|At the end his life's story, all true and not at all an attempt at rewriting history}}

[http://www.difrawiconsulting.com/story-4.php Yes, he is seriously calling himself that.]

Go ahead and hire him already. A real asset to any marketing company, no annoying scruples to worry about. Many will thank you if you can get him an honest job for once.
