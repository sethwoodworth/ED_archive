Blogs4brownback
'''Blogs4brownback''' is a [[troll|satirical]] blog made by some /b/tard that got hit with the [[b&|b&hammer]] for posting [[CP]]. Nominated for Best Conservative Blog but didn't win. The main purpose of the site is to troll people by posting obviously [[retarded]] posts. Unfortunately, nobody bothers to feed the troll and people end up [[tubgirl|flooding]] [[lemon party|the]] [[2girls1cup|entries]] [[goatse|with]] [[rickroll|all]] [[pain series|sorts]] [[The Power 5|of]] [[desu|spam]]. But to counter this, the admin frequently [[sockpuppets]] as random people in order to try and troll people harder, but [[you fail it|fails at that as well]]. They also make references to [[memes]] and end up [[Doing it wrong|using them in the wrong way]] and [[Facepalm|failing even harder]].

==Attack on 4chan==

Since the owner of the site [[Bawwwww|complains about getting spammed on his blog]], he decided to make a blog stating how [http://blogs4brownback.wordpress.com/2008/01/01/4chan-totally-gay/ 4chan is totally teh gay]. This led to the flooding of the site to increase two fold just for the owner to [[unwarranted self importance|admire all of the pageviews he has]]. After a while, Anonymous grew tired of spamming [[desu]] on the blog and decided to [[Masturbate|go do something more worth his time]]. The site owner [http://blogs4brownback.wordpress.com/2008/04/07/4chan-just-how-ghey-are-they/ decided to attack again], but nobody gave a shit since pissing in an ocean of piss is [[typical|pointless]].

==Attack on Barack Obama==
Has repeatedly called the president of the United States a gay muslim crackhead as can be seen here: [http://blogs4brownback.wordpress.com/2008/02/22/barack-obama-is-a-homosexual-crackhead/]. But joke's on him as Mike Huckafag didn't win.
