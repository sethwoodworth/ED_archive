'''Lil B''', sometimes called '''The Based God''' is an extremely [[pro-life|prolific]] "[[rap|rapper]]" from Berkeley, California who is incredibly popular on [[YouTube]].

Let this video set the tone for the rest of the article:

==Career==
Lil B burst onto the music scene in 2009 as a member of the [[hyphy]] group '''The Pack'''. They found some success with their single "[[v&|Van]]s," which was lauded by Rolling Stone Magazine. Unfortunately, their album failed to find much popularity outside the Bay Area and the group disbanded.

Not to be discouraged, Lil B took to the [[internet]] with his [[shit|talent]], using various social networking sites to garner interest in his work. Like his pal [[Soulja Boy]], Lil B has millions of fans on [[YouTube]] who will buy none of his music.

===His "Music"===

If you've heard more than one of his songs, you might notice that they '''all sound the same''. Some believe his entire career is based around a game of Mad Lib that got out of control. The only song that deviates from his formula is "[[rape|Violate That Bitch]]."

He also has a song entitled '''Today's Weather''', where he [[David Tanny|raps about the weather forecast]].

==How to Write a Song Like Lil B==
#Record yourself yelling "swag" and "whoop"--you will rap over yourself later
#Repeat the line "Bitches suck my dick because I look like ________" over and over again to make sure everyone gets the point. Fill in the blank with whatever celebrity you desire. Don't worry. It doesn't have to make sense.
#You will then need to repeat your previously chosen celebrity's name a few times. Again, this is to ensure the meaning of the song doesn't get lost in the insane depth of your other lyrics.
#Constantly refer to yourself by a nickname no one understands.

Do this approximately 10 times, using the same backing track. Release these songs on a "mixtape." If done properly, you should be able to put out 10-15 mixtapes per year.

===Cooking Music===
Lil B enjoys referring to his songs as "cooking music." Approximately 80% of his videos on YouTube contain some inexplicable reference to him cooking. To an outside observer, it appears as if Lil B is, effectively, trying to create his own genre.

To accompany this genre, Lil B has also released an unnecessarily long tutorial video on how to do the '''Cooking Dance'''.

==The (free)Based God==
He likes to refer to himself by this name quite frequently, but no one actually knows what it means. It's highly likely that Lil B was, in fact, a crack baby, so perhaps that can explain his choice of nickname.

The Based God is also the name of his reality show. It is, however, important to note that this show consists of two episodes, each under two minutes long, and posted only to Lil B's YouTube account.
