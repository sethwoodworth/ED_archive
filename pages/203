'''Abunchofnumbers''', better known as '''abackofpanthers''', '''pantherback''', or '''backpanther''', is a [[Something Awful]] goon  who serves as a walking, talking showcase of what happens when you act without thinking. His life is a veritable gallery of bad decisions.

==The tattoo==

{{squote|No scarring etc, I shaved the rest of my back minus the tattoo, the top hair did grow back a lot quicker though. Uh my neck looks kind of funny, but aside from that enjoy.|abackofpanthers, displaying a remarkable lack of shame}}
The design is a poor copy of a fundraiser t-shirt from the Shambala Big Cat preserve in Acton, CA.

==The motorcycles==
He asked the Something Awful automotive subforum for advice on a bike, and received numerous recommendations that he start with a low-powered, newbie-orieted model. He ignored everyone and bought a bike way too advanced for him, then proceeded to crash three times. After each crash, they advised him on a better bike for someone of his experience level, but pantherback did the exact opposite and got a larger bike each time.

==The accident==
{{squote|1=lady pulled in front of me and i swerved but didnt make it. i was thrown 58 feet and hit the top of a light pole and bounced to the side and hit a second pole and then fell face first into the ground|2=abunchofnumbers, October 11, 2008 [http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2764921&userid=117665#post350521055 source]}}

{{squote|1=i was doing 40 in a 45 becaus i saw the lady and impact is estimated to be at 40mph. it didnt matter what bike i was on, i could have been jay lenos jet emgine superbike and things would have been the same, nowhere to swerve and nowhere to go is always a lose in any vehicle. i was a new and inexperienced rider with ~11 months experience, the only way to cure that is to do it.

==The investment==
The insurance settlement was for more than $900,000 (USD). Eager to turn his life around, abunchofnumbers posted a thread in the business and finance subforum asking for advice on investments. He received a lot of good advice about mutual funds and other good ways to make money off a significant lump sum, he ignored all of it in favor of buying a shitload of San Diego real estate. That's right: he invested almost a million dollars in California real estate in late 2008.

And he bought a Lamborghini.

A manual-transmission Lamborghini.

{{squote|the solstice may be great car wise but it is very gay looking and pontiac doesn't have the same zing to it as saying "I drive a lamborghini"|abunchofnumbers}}
