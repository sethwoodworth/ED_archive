In the horrible teenage wasteland known as [[Web 2.0]], every known site or thing related with art is infested with the cancers known as [[furry]], generic [[animu]] and [[teenager|teenage]] [[angst]].  It is sad, but true, that people's first impression of art on the internets is the circle-jerk [[hugbox]] community known as DeviantART.  There is one place out there, one of very few that is a dedicated art site that the [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=72950 main focus] is amazingly ''NOT'' about how many [[deviantart#Pageviews|pageviews]] you can get, how well you can [[Superdemon-Inuyasha|trace inuyasha]], how you can express your angst through [[emo|shit poetry]] and furry cutting action, or how many times you can say "''[[wapanese|OMG! KAWAII =^___^=]] *Hugs* *[[Glomp|GLOMP]]* OMG!1 [[Invader Zim|DOOM!!  GIR! ZIM!]]''".

The place is [http://www.conceptart.org ConceptArt], and the main focus is actually to learn how to become a better artist through [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=51391 critique and discipline], [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=40603 which is a rare thing nowadays].  Yes, it is hard to comprehend that there is actually an art site where teenagers and furries are surprisingly in the minority, as well as everyone not being the owner of at least 3 [[neopets]] accounts.  So then why would a [http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=51739 seemingly drama-free bastion] of [[mundane|sanity]] even be mentioned here?  Well, read on my [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=46842 astonished friend]:

== Teh [[Drama]] ==

Who and what [http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=31763 causes drama here]?  Well, mostly people from DeviantART, of course! (God help us if anyone from [[Sheezyart]] tries.)  Since being raised in the degenerating [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=57411 masturbatory] [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=73460 hugbox] culture of TARTland, where words like "critique" are not in their dictionary, TARTlets have an expectation of being showered with pageviews and [[over 9000|at least 9000]] ''[[faggotry|glomp]]'' emoticons.  Upon  posting their [[shit|art]], which is usually full of [[photoshop]] filters, [[lens flare]], and [[FAIL]], the response is generally an honest critique basically saying: "Yeah, it's bad, but here is some helpful advice from real professionals that will make you actually improve rather than stagnate . . . "  A TARTlet, who can't comprehend that this advice is helpful, will immediately do the most predictable thing that [[teenager]]s do best: Violently [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=47767 deny that they have done anything wrong], and [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=66382 take it personally].

The usual [[victim complex|excuses]] are to the effect of: 
*"''[http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=46842 This is my style]''"
*"''I'm only X-teen years old''"
*"''this is an older pic''"

=== The <strike>Furry</strike> Fury ===

[[Image:Krystallwolvelt_-_master_of_puppets.jpg|thumb|200px|Krystallwolvelt's "Evil Master of Puppets" from this thread: [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=54045]]]

[[Image:Krystallwolvelt's shitty art.jpg|thumb|200px| YOU FAIL IT (It Is Art)]]

A classic example of this lunacy is this furry TARTlet who wandered in with a bloated ego posting some abysmal art with the pretentious title: "The Puppet Master" [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=54045] 
Epic amounts of fail and sheer arrogance were displayed with this thread, and despite ConceptArt's best efforts, he continued to deny any wrong doing. 

After however, having a severe ego inflation, and perhaps getting his [[shit|artcrap]] hit on by some [[furries|furry]], he came back once more to post some mixed media [[crap|crapwork]] [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=56956] before promptly being [[lulz|lulzed]] off [[shit|Conceptart]] for his sheer inept [[you fail it|failure]] to understand that he should quit Art forever.

=== SnapeSnogger loses it ===

One of the more famous events happened was when [[Snapesnogger|Ms. Ego-Snoggy-Supreme]] ventured blindly into the ConceptArt forums posting one of her classic fetish fanarts. [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=62767]
She received justifiable criticism, then unsurprisingly went [[batshit insane]].  To make matters worse, some other Snogger fans came into the thread to defend her from the harsh undeniable truth.  One of these was some cunt with the predictable [[wapanese]] name " [http://yusagi.deviantart.com/ Yusagi] " who said some amazingly arrogant drivel such as:

*"''True talent doesn't require blood and sweat, and I don't know about Snogger, but I prefer to be taught by someone talented, than someone skilled--I can learn everything they know from a book.''"

*Favoring snoggers "art" over something decent like  [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=61557 this] with:

*"''What makes that so good? I personally find them to be nothing spectacular, in fact, I find them to be dreary, and the second woman to be unintentionally fat.''"  LOL, WUT?

=== The Saga of darthnader ===

What happens when a site so awesome as CA.org scares off the weaboos and furries?  You would think that the lulz would end, but luckily for us all, there are still fucktards like [http://conceptart.org/forums/member.php?u=67987 darthnader] who think that talking as if they were on ED= instant win.  It appears that in the war to fight retardedness he became infected by the disease himself.

Interestingly, it seems that unlike most of those who try to gain their fame and asspats through behaving like Tartlets on CA, he saw the ineffectiveness of such tactics and chose to take a different approach: flaming the hell out of any such undesirable elements... unfortunately for him all such entities had already been scared off.

=== Armageddon ===

Apparently there is another way to bring forth drama upon the threads of CA, and the way is to zergling rush/troll the site owner, Jason Manley. Apparently doing so will cause him to go apeshit, whine about how nice he is, talk about fighting off pirates, shut down threads and the entire lounge in a lame attempt to hide the mean things someone said about him, and wield the banhammer haphazardly striking anyone who is foolish enough to stand too close. 

This was what happened last Thursday as over 9000 forumites, tired of Jason's insistent demands for cash and admiration, stopped "baaah"ing and began to question his motives and demand transparency.  Rather than an explanation being given the Lounge was closed.  Of course, there was an uproar, and chaos ensued.  Many, including long time members, fled the scene, taking refuge at other art sites.  All the while the poor employees of Massive Black watched in horror as their fearless leader tore asunder the wonderful community they had so lovingly helped to build and nurture from its infancy, some questioning how they could have let it come to this, others asking the inevitable question; could they continue working for a creature so foul as to treat his devoted followers in such a heinous way.

[[File:Manley_dart.jpg‎|thumb|200px|Building a better Batmobile. ]]In 2010, the San Francisco Pod of Manley's school, The Art Department ("Pod" doesn't stand for anything, Manley made it up because he likes making up dumb names for things. Possibly it is a reference to the average girth of the student body.), failed miserably.  Faculty and students were screwed viciously as instructional DVD sale royalties went unpaid, instructors (including Manley) failed to show up to actually teach classes, and tuition fees were squandered on Manley's "restoring" a Dodge Dart that was propped on cement blocks in the school's lobby.  Manley apparently wavered between "turning it into the ECTO-1" and "building a better Batmobile".  As of this writing, the car remains primer-painted and finless.

In summer 2010, the SF Pod collapsed utterly.  The Safehouse Atelier, a splinter cell, began operations in San Francisco under Carl Dobsky.  Students screwed by TAD continue to roll into the aptly-named Safehouse to just get back to their goddamn educations please already jesus christ. 

[[File:Jason_manley.jpg‎|thumb|200px|Manley reaches for a TAD tuition check. ]]The storm has subsided.  An uneasy peace has resumed, but the trust is lost.  Manley sits on his throne (actually a haphazard mucus-and-paper cocoon comprised mostly of TAD student tuition checks and a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooms yellowish slime]), nursing his wounded pride, missing the days when lifting a pinky would bring heaps of "thanks" and 6 to 25 pages of praise.

== The Legend of Nibru ==

[[Image:Nibruoriginal.jpeg|thumb|200px|The saviour of CA lulz]]

Being without Lulz for a hideously long time, the users of conceptart.org looked back to the golden days; Mankey, its first true lulz cow, the coming of [[Snapesnogger|Snapesnogger]] and the graceful entry of [[chasethehedgehog|chasethehedgehog]]. CA users feared that, as a forest periodically needs a fire, without a healthy dose of retardedness they would be unable to cultivate this years' lulz harvest.

Then ''He'' arrived [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=171264]

It began as it always does; [[Shitty_Art|beginner artist]] enters CA thinking it's DA and made up of similar [[Shitty_Art|beginner artists]] when in reality it's populated by industry professionals and serious students. The new artist, known as "divinenibru" also thought that his little activity, based around other artists drawing their interpretations of his very lulz-worthy character named "Nibru", was awfully unique and worthy of everyone's time (despite the fact that many activities already take place each week on CA, some with prizes, some led or joined by pros).

{{quote|He's what I imagine my Guardian Angel to look like.|divinenibru, after eating shrooms}}

{{quote|Things that should remain constant through all interpretations:

- The Halo on top of his head, it should be a solid halo-shaped object above his head. The stripes don't have to be there though...

- His Mouth is stitched shut, his eye brows are composed of stitches and the marks on his right and left cheek (think of them as warpaint)

- He is old, has only his left eye and has long hair

- A Necklace that's the letter M

- He should be carrying a spear but the design of the spear can change|divinenibru being unintentionally funny}}

[[Image:Wesnibru1.jpg|thumb|200px|Wesburt (a guy who's done work for Sony, EA & Activision) becomes Nibru's first disciple]]

Faced with a possible tartlet armed with a drawing made on lined paper, the jaded denizens of CA expected the obvious; zero participation with some light flaming leading to the eventual closing of the thread. Nearly 3 hours passed, and without a reply most CA members who happened upon the thread anticipated its quiet descent into obscurity or a quick skirmish followed by lock. No one could have guessed that it would resurrect Lulz on CA.

{{quote|This turned out to be... not what i expected.|Slash, tearful in disbelief}}

It all started when Wesburt decided that enough was enough. CA's undeclared war on lulz was an illegal war, and needed to end. Rather than mock the new user in customary passive-aggressive fashion, or direct them to CA's activity center, Wes did what no professional had previously dared; he joined in, becoming the first disciple and honorary templar in the church of Nibru. Like a true Nibru knight, he kept the trademark lined paper.

With one of their own taking the plunge, the art dragons of CA spread their sparkling wings, opened their gaping maws and unleashed a fiery barrage of professional-grade art based on a high school kid's doodle of a ''stitch-faced, MacDonalds-endorsing sneaker-wearing emo wizard with a doughnut on his head'' scrawled on notebook paper. Artists who had worked on AAA projects were joining in left and right, and over the course of the next few days CA users lawled and basked in the warm glow of pure, unrefined hilarity, all the while divinenibru (apparently having no concept either satire or what constitutes professional art) [[Lonely|thought he had made some new friends]].
