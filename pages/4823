Let me show you
{{crapstub}}

'''My X, let me show you it''' (or '''My X, let me show you them''') is the template for a minor [[meme]], used when the poster wishes to display something, such as [[Pokeymanz]], with "X" being the the item(s) to be displayed. It is almost always displayed as part of an [[image macro]] or [[demotivator]].
