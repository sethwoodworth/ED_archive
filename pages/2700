Eric W. Schwartz
[[Image:Eric_Schwartz.jpg|right|thumb]]

The author of the [[webcomic]] ''Sabrina Online'', '''Eric Schwartz''', is the [[furry]] [[fandom|fandom]]'s favorite [[Beardfag|bearded]] [[fatty]], also known for producing [[Rule 34|Disney tentacle porn]] under the pseudonym '''TDK'''. This shitty excuse for a secret identity fools nobody, but Schwartz still claims he's innocent and throws a [[Hissy Fit|fit]] [[Irony|when anyone does the same to his characters]]. Being an internet [[oldfag]] he might have been the origin of the [[Web 1.0]] term "skunk fucker", now substituted by "furfag". The saddest thing about him is that he actually has talent. Yet instead of developing that skill in order to produce real art or comics, he wastes it in favour of the safety of doing Tiny Toons porn and other shit.

==[http://www.sabrina-online.com/ Sabrina Online]==
When he started the comic it shamelessly promoted the [[Amiga]] in a way that would make every [[macfag]] cower in fetal position. It features a nerdy skunk girl without pants who collects [[Transformers]] and begins an [[Internet relationship]] with an equally big loser. This went on till Eric decided his comic should be about constant yiffing and thus he introduced [[whore|Zig Zag]], a tiger-striped skunk who runs a porn studio and screws anything that moves. After her attempt at seducing Sabrina failed she focused on making [[CP]] of Sabrina's [[Lolicon|baby sister]] Tabitha getting fucked by living [[Transformers]] dildos.

The average Sabrinafag is a [[basement dweller]] with a [[fursecution]] complex who knows the closest he'll get to having sex is to rape the skunks he captured in the woods.

==TDK==
As mentioned before TDK is the product of Eric's brain trying to cope with his [[Sick fuck|deviant desires]]. These consist mostly of beloved cartoon characters getting raped by [[Hentai|tentacle monsters]]:

Eric thinks that his [[retarded]] fans would hate him if he admits being TDK, though the truth is that they don't care what he does as long as they get to fap to tentacle porn. Therefore, he still denies his [[Insane|split personality]] despite contradicting evidence:
* Both EWS and TDK refuse to outgrow the Amiga-phase.
* Both reside in Columbus, [[Ohio]].
* They have the same drawing style.
* [http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?pi=1000304956 They use the same computers.]

==Secret Sabrina Society==
Eventually justice struck down on Eric in the form of the '''Secret Sabrina Society''', a [[Rule 34]] fanclub. Eric raged and eventually made this [http://www.sabrina-online.com/fanfaq.html FAQ], even though he also draws porn of his [[Imaginary girlfriend|pretend girlfriend]] which he only shares with his closest pals.

==Fandom==

[[Image:Max_is_a_pedo.JPG|right|thumb|He's also pedo for Tabitha.]]

In every big fandom there are always a few [[lolcows]]. In the furry fandom however everyone is a lolcow. And due to the Sabrina Online fandom consisting entirely of Amiganerds and furfags lusting after Sabrina's bare butt they are basically shitting [[lulz]]:

===Max Blackrabbit===
Closest butt buddy of Eric, this black person is the creator of mega-slut Zig Zag who Eric [http://www.crushyiffdestroy.com/show/zz has an unhealthy obsession with]. In return his [[fursona]] also stalked Sabrina proving that their creators are indeed [[gay]] for each other.

===[http://www.chrisfoxx.com/ Chris Foxx]===
[[Image:Chriszap.jpg|left|thumb|Don't you dare touching my fictional girlfriend[[Oneoneone|!!!1]]]]
[[File:SabrinaOnline Death.jpg|thumb|He's wispering [[You just lost the game|something]] onto her ear.]]

Even though he has family, this guy wrote a [[TL;DR|56-chapters]] story about [[Ray Jones|him being in love with a cartoon character]]. The best lulz are had when his fursona has to leave Sabrina in the story because he didn't get permission from Eric and when he gets '''sprayed by Sabrina while yiffing'''.

Another good moment is in ''Tabitha'' when that little [[cunt]] Sabrina dies.
* And [http://www.wilderhom.com/stories/sabems.htm here], you'll find the same comic, [[Shit nobody cares about|told from a paramedic's point of view]].

===[http://www.ic-stories.com/ Hikaru Katayama]===

[[Image:Identity_Crisis.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mary Sue]] pile-up]]

''Hikaru Katayama'' is the author of ''Identity Crisis''. Opposed to the title this doesn't deal with Eric's own little identity crisis but is about an EWS-fan who gets beamed to the Sabrinaverse where he starts a relationship with ZZ actress Sheila Vixen, [[FYIAD|becomes a dragon]], [[Transformation|swaps bodies with Sheila]], and later gets [[rape|rape]]d by a prince from ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''. (He originally intended the story to be PG-13 but later got too yiffy.) However, he is the only one allowed to [[fap|jerk off]] to the rape chapter and put up a disclaimer telling everyone else to become [[an hero]]. [http://www.crushyiffdestroy.com/furryTut/index.php?page=1|''How to be a Furry''] sums it up pretty nicely:
{{quote|It is not uncommon for such beings to have magic powers, and exist in alternate universes where everyone is a furry. Oddly enough, in these universes, trenchcoats, katanas, sunglasses, and mysterious mystical amulets passed down through the generations are in plentiful supply.}}

===Various faggotry===

[[Image:Sabrina_tattoo_of_fail.jpg|left|thumb|How to tell who's to be [[Holocaust|exterminated]].]]

* [[Canadian]] [[fantards]] Style Wager and Greg Older did an even shittier semi spin-off called [http://www.delathehooda.com/ ''Dela the Hooda'']. There won't be an article about it however because the "[http://www.delathehooda.com/archive/ archive]" is so fucking unusable it hurts more than the actual content. (Which, from what we could gather, features a [[lesbian]] fox sent in our universe by a [[Nazi]] scientist.)
* [http://psychomouse.phoenixcrash.net/sorp/ ''Sabrina Online Radio Play''] brings us the joy of listening to a yiffing Sabrina. The creators try to be as authentic as possible and emulate skunk mating noises by raping their pets. A live action series is also planned and furries look forward to the hotel rape scene acted out with [[fursuits]].
* When [[Portal of Evil]] (called [[b/|Bashfandom]] by Eric) put up a forum about ''Sabrina Online'' the fans became butthurt and tried to [[Delete Fucking Everything|SPAM FUCKING EVERYTHING]].[http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?pi=1000294284] This didn't work out so well because [[X is not your personal army|furries are too retarded to be anyone's personal army]].
* Some [[YouTube Poop]]ers, furfags and general fags alike, have used Eric W. Schwartz' shit as source material for their YouTube Poops, and some have even become obsessed with Sabrina, putting her as their [http://www.youtube.com/user/rushnerd user] [http://www.youtube.com/user/CommanderGwonam images] and [http://www.youtube.com/user/Badluckcrowthe2nd back][http://www.youtube.com/user/YTPnews1 grounds].

{{quote|I'm going to rape Sabrina's little sister, Tabitha, with a savagery you cannot even begin to imagine in your deepest fever-dream!|Typical Sabrinafag}}

==Other porn==

[[Image:Spoogefolio_3_A_Visit_From_Slimy_07.jpg|right|thumb]]

In a desperate attempt to make money Eric created a [http://www.furafterdark.com/ porn site] where you can pay to see supportive characters fucking each other. This one is created under a regular name so he doesn't publish porn of Zig Zag fucking Minerva Mink there though he still makes tentacle porn as seen on the right where two skunks are raped by a hentai blob.

==Furries ruin everything==

Eric, in all his Amigafaggotry, presents us this steaming pile of shit and ruins [[Portal]] for everyone:
