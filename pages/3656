{{blueblink|<big>BATMAN:1  JOKER:0</big>}}

'''Heathcliff Andrew Ledger''', known on [[4chan]] as '''Keith Dedger''' (April 4, 1979 – January 22, 2008) was a [[homosexual]] [[Australia]]n actor, most noted for his ass-ramming antics on ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''. That movie was only the culmination of a career in [[prostitute|professional faggotry]], starting with his first ever role as a [[gay]] cyclist in the TV series ''[[buttsecks|Sweat]]''. He then went on to further success jabbing men with large sticks in the [[secks|action]] hit ''[[rape|A Knight's Tale]]''.



He grew up [[rich and beautiful]], which no doubt led to his now [[an hero]]ic addiction to [[hookers and blow]]. He was [[fag|one of those]] actors who believed the best way to get in the mind-set of a [[emo|self-destructive]] character is to follow their example. So to prepare for his role as a serial-killer clown in the ''[[Batman]]'' movie he decided to kill a bunch of people, starting with himself. 

The cause of death was a wicked [[self pwn]], claimed to be an overdose of [[heaven|prescription drugs]]. However, [[Steve Irwin|death by poisonous barbs]] was the rage in [[Australia]] at the time; an overdose of [[AIDS]] was considered another potential cause. His last words are reputed to be "LOL BRB SUICIDE."

According to pre-pubescent boys, he was the greatest actor of all-time, despite the fact that they can't name any movies with him in it besides [[The Dark Knight]]. In this movie, the bulk of his acting consisted of [[Fact|ripping off Tim Burton movies]] and licking his lips. Basically, the role could have been played equally as well by anyone able to watch Beetlejuice.

__TOC__

==Early Career==
Young Heath began his acting career at a young age playing the leading role in ''Peter Pan''. Traditionally, the role of Peter Pan is reserved for a female, but Ledger landed the role with his teachers citing his effeminate and often eccentric behavior making him "more ladylike than the rest of them." After an early graduation, he moved to Sydney with his "Girlfriend" and "Best Friend" (fag hag and lover, respectively), where he landed a role as a gay cyclist. After a few television appearances and a few handjobs to producers, he made it to the big time. 

==Career==
* '''''10 Things I Hate About You''''' (1999) - Played a [[bipolar]] badass Australian with a habit of smoking in class and a soft spot for [[Buttsecks|good girls]] [[Gay|and poetry]].
* '''''The Patriot'' ''' (2000) - Ironically played a [[inbred|Redneck South Carolinian]] [[911|Patriot]]. With an Australian accent.
* '''''A Knight's <strike>Tale</strike> [[Fail]]''''' (2001) - Another ironic role where he played a British peasant who risks his life for his love of wrestling men to the ground, horses, and long wooden sticks.
* '''''Lords Of Dogtown''''' (2005) - Ledger played a [[Paris Hilton|perpetually doped]] up skate shop owner who couldn't skateboard so he [[shota|convinced young men]] to skateboard in his name.
* '''''The Brothers Grimm''''' (2005) - Adopted a new European accent, as opposed to the Aussie [[retard|drawl]] he retained in "''A Knight's Tale''" a few years back.
* '''''Brokeback Mountain''''' (2005) - Introduced the practice of strap-on [[pegging|'pegging']] to his wife, the  [[Hillary Clinton|nerdy fat girl]] on ''Dawson's Creek''. Eventually moved on to full-blown sexual encounters with [[gay|other men]].
* '''''Casanova''''' (2005) - Violator of Virgins, who in the end falls in loves and starts playing wingman for his [[BFF]].
* '''''Candy''''' (2006) - [http://www.cinemablend.com/celebrity/Heath-Ledger-Checks-Into-Rehab-1606.html Admitted himself] to a [[drug]] rehab facility to get in the mind of [[irony|actual drug addicts]], slowly moving up to the hard stuff and needles.
* '''''The Dark Knight'''''  (2008) - The new Joker is a psychotic [[BDSM|sadist]] with intentionally sloppy clown makeup and a heavy supply of prescription medication.  He also knew a magic trick that could make a pencil disappear. [[Spoiler|I hate to ruin the ending, but something tells me that this Joker's not going to be in the next sequel.]]
* '''''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus''''' (2009) (<i>'''Was'''</i> ''Filming'')

In the movies, superheroes are created by accidental [[science]] experiments, and [[Asperger's|geniuses]] go mad through mental breakdowns caused by psychotropic substances. However, IRL, Heath's drug overdose simply resulted in [[dying alone]].

[[Image:Scientology did heath.jpg|thumb|center|PROOF!]]

==Life as a confused Hollywood heartthrob==
His striking good looks and Australian accent quickly earned him the badge of "heartthrob" in [[media]] outlets.  His good looks first won over the hearts of a generation of teenage american girls when he appeared in the film "10 Things I Hate About You" and fingerfucked a nigger in the butt.

==Buttsecks Boogaloo and Controversy==
[[Image:Whysodead.jpg|thumb|[[Why So Exploitable?]]]]
[[Image:Batman13.jpg|thumb]]
Heath is perhaps best known and loved for his role as the [[gay]] [[fag|cowboy]] in the Academy Award-winning [[porn|film]] '''''Brokeback Mountain'''''. Despite widespread [[herpes|praise]] for his portrayal of a gay man, [[some argue|critics argue]] that Heath's character is not really a 'cowboy' at all but, instead, a [[rape]]-[[crazy]] [[ass pirate]]. 

<s>Of note here is, of course, the '''[[DOING IT WRONG|disconcertingly minimal foreplay and shocking absence of lubricant]]'''. Studies show that, as the [[ass|rectal]] [[shit|mucosa]] provides little natural lubrication, a lubricant (such as a personal lubricant) is most often required or preferred when penetrating the anus. Leading [[scientologists]] agree that an insufficient amount of lubricant can make [[anal sex]] especially painful or injurious, given the vulnerability of the anal tissues. Damage is more likely if intercourse is [[rape|forcible or aggressive]]; if alcohol or other [[drugs]] have dulled sensitivity; if communication is poor; if technique is clumsy; or if you just [[pwn|spit on your fat cowboy cock and ram it right in without much warning]]. </s> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]] - Everyone knows that Heath Ledger's micropenis couldn't have injured a rubber thimble.

Despite the high risk of injury when [[buttsecks|fucking without lube]], Heath still pounded Jake Gyllenhaal's [[ass]] into [[Goatse|this]]. Clearly, when Heath wants to rape someone anally, [[BitingBeaver|everything goes right out the window]].

Meanwhile, prominent [[gay]] activists have publicly suggested that next time Jake Gyllenhaal should consider [[HTS-Noob|safer alternatives]] to Heath's [[penis|Ledger]].

[[Image:Bateman.jpg|thumb|''"The true cause of Heath Ledger's death"'']]

==Death==

{{quote|''"[[BRB|Grabbin']] [[Drugs|pills]]!"''|Heath Ledger|a star's last words}}<br>

According to the Zionist media, the confusion of his sexual preferences, compounded by the pressures of society and the media, led him to OD on [[drugs|sleeping pills]]. However, the actual cause of death was an an axe to the head. During the filming of ''The Dark Knight'', Christian Bale caught a glimpse of Ledger's business card. As Bale looked at the card, and saw its slightly off white coloring and its watermark, he was instantly filled with murderous rage and jealousy over Heath's superior card. So he invited Ledger over to his apartment, where he lectured Heath on how Huey Lewis and the News' song "Hip to Be Square" was not only a song about the pleasure of conformity and the importance of trends, but a personal statement about the band members themselves. Bale then got naked underneath a see-through plastic overcoat and butchered Ledger's head with an axe. After this he invited naked dwarves to his place for a naked cocaine party where they would use Ledger's penis as a ping pong paddle for disturbing spanking exercises. [[Image:LOLIRONYY.JPG|thumb|Apparently Keith Ledger fanfic is all the rage.]]

To make things moar embarrassing for Ledger, Bale moved the body to [[Olsen Twins|Mary-Kate Olsen's]] apartment, his former [[whore|party pal]]. ''[[Idiots|People]]'' magazine reports that "They were [[Felching|hooking up]], but neither were particularly interested in making it exclusive."

As for what drew the two together, says the source, "They had a bond that was based on [[Party Hard|partying]], and they had the [[meth|same tastes]] in partying... like, in terms of where they liked to hang out in New York, what time they would want to go out. [[Disturbed|They just had the same sensibility]]." [[Image:Jokerwrong.PNG|thumb|He clearly used a gun, not pills!]]

Without question and beyond doubt, Ledger was supremely fucked up, as he was described as being charmed by Olsen, who made him laugh as he would scarf down a big meal.

"Mary-Kate made him laugh a lot," an eyewitness recalled. 

After Ledger's death, an entire news network was created so that people may ignore [[IRL]] things, and watch continuous updates as to  his career, and the circumstances surrounding death.  This news network used to be called [[CNN]].

===Official Report===
[[Image:Brokeback_quit_you.jpg|thumb|''"[[Old meme|I wish I knew how to quit you...]]"'']]

Like with every breaking story, [[Faux News]] was on the scene immediately. The following is taken from Faux's web site, written by [[Brian Williams]]:

Gay penis puffer and star of the epic butt cowboy screenplay ''Brokeback Mountain'' Heath Ledger was found dead in his ratty <s>Australian</s> New York apartment yesterday from what police say appears to have been a fatal overdose of semen and cocaine suffered at an orgy comprised of some 20 men and at least one hermaphrodite.  Upon noticing Ledger was dead, the participants fled the scene and continued the orgy at another location.  When asked about Ledger's untimely death, his mother, Ethel's only comment was, "At least Hollywood will no longer be subject to movies with faggots wearing nothing but chaps and cowboy hats prancing around outside and waving their penises before they suck each other off."

===[http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/24/heath.ledger.dead/index.html When You Hire Stupid People, Don't Expect to Live.]===
'''January 24th 2008:''' [[whore|Masseuse]], rocket scientist and [[idiot|forward thinker]] Diana Wolozin got to Ledger's apartment 2:45 p.m. to give Ledger [[sex|a healing massage]]. After [[Looting|wandering around the apartment for about 15 minutes]] she went in and set up a massage table nearby [[Necrophilia|Ledger]].

After shaking Ledger and thinking he might be dead she did what any smart [[whore|Masseuse]] would do:  She called all the way to [[California]] to Mary Kate Olsen ''four times'' before calling [[911]] on Ledger's [[Iphone|cell phone]].

===Economic Impact===

Since Heath was responsible for 75% of [[fag|Australia's]] GDP, [[over 9000]] points were lost on the Australian Securities Exchange Market 5 minutes after his death was announced. The market rebounded, fortunately, when more cheap [[slave|Chin]] goods flooded the country.

===[[The_Onion|Wikipedia]] reacts===
[[No_Life|Blake Yardley]] [[faggotry|reports his death]]. [http://www.theonion.com/content/news/area_man_honored_to_be_one_who]

===God Hates Heaths===
[[Fred Phelps]] immediately declared victory over the evil faggots and proclaimed his desire to dance on the ''Brokeback Mountain'' [[homo]]'s [[AIDS]] infected grave. This led to copious amounts of [[butthurt]] from the gay community who loved to [[fap]] to his picture.

It would have been a true quest of lol if Phelps and the gang had actually attempted to picket the funeral of a celebrity; apparently they has sum security or somthin'. Also, the funeral was held in [[Australia]], making the legality of picketing a funeral there and the cost of flying the whole family there an awesome waste of time and money.

Heath's [[The Dark Knight|final role]] would later be related in [[Bel-Air|this song]]...

Now, this is a story all about how <br> My life got flipped-turned upside down <br> And I liked to take a minute <br> Just sit there son <br> I'll tell you how I became the menacing Joker of Gotham. 


Well no idea where I was born or raised <br> An Asylum was where I spent most of my days <br> Spazzin' Out, Schitzin, Laughin' all cool <br> And all digging my way out with a stolen tool <br> When a couple of guards <br> Caught me out of my bed <br> I stabbed them in the face and now they're kinda dead <br> Broke out of Arkham and Gotham's where I went, <br> They found nothing in my pockets except knives and lint,



Evening Commissioner 

I just wanna be the guy who's fun and feared, <br> And if I may say, I really dig the beard, <br> Everyone points and call me delirious, <br> But I just laugh and ask, "Why so serious?" 

Well I broke out some cell-mates, and set them free, <br> And told them they were all just freaks like me, <br> If they wanna destroy Gotham, there's just one plan, <br> It's obvious the only way is: kill the batman 

I destroyed half of Gotham by two or three, <br> And I yelled to the batman, "Come on, hit me" <br> Looked at Gotham, as it all laid in waste, <br> Come on, batman, Lets put a smile on that face.

"He died a few months ago. I suspect you already know this and are doing whats commonly known as 'trolling'. You deliberately posted this question looking for a reaction. Very sad." - Some fat bitch


"do you live in a cave? heath ledge has been dead since January." - Worlds most epic pun!

"He didn't go, what an Ass." - I know right!


"[[tl;dr| I do not know whether you are "trolling" or genuinely asking this question, and so since it is not proper to assume that you are trolling so I shall answer your question. Heath Ledger did not attend the premiere because he died in New York on January 22nd 2008. He was discovered unconscious in his fourth-floor SoHo apartment by his housekeeper and masseuse. The masseuse used Ledger's speed-dial on his cell phone to call his friend and fellow actress Mary-Kate Olsen, who directed a New York police officer to the scene at 3.26pm. The masseuse then phoned 911 to say that "Mr Ledger was not breathing" and, upon the urgings of the 911 operator administered CPR, but was unsuccessful. EMT were also unsuccessful in reviving him. Ledger was pronounced dead at 3.36pm and his body was removed from the apartment. His death was reported to have been the cause of a lethal mix of certain sleeping pills and anti-depressants prescribed to him by his doctors ("Mr. Heath Ledger died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam and doxylamine."). He did not commit suicide, as the death was an accident. Having spent most of his time working for "I'm Not There", "The Dark Knight" and "The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus" over the last few months, Ledger had trouble with anxiety and insomnia. The reason he took so many of those different pills that day is said to be just a desperate attempt to catch up on sleep. Interestingly, Jack Nicholson (who played the Joker in the 1989 Batman film by Tim Burton) said he "warned" Heath Ledger on taking on the role of the Joker. In an MTV interview he expressed his anger that he was not asked to return to the Batman series, so perhaps this was sour grapes or was he genuinely warning Ledger that the role would have a heavy toll? Tributes to Ledger have been posted all over the world, including YouTube users fan videos to flowers and cards outside the apartment in SoHo to DVD tributes (he played Robbie in the Bob Dylan-inspired film "I'm Not There" in 2007, and recently the DVD was released and included a tribute to Heath in the special features section). In "The Dark Knight" (2008), his last fully completed film, he and Conway Wickliffe (a special effects technician who died in a car accident while preparing one of the film's stunts in London) received a dedication in the credits. The premiere was several months after his death"]] - Y SO SRS?
