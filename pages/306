Aircraftkiller (aka ACK) is an internet person who has managed to incite more drama than you can fit onto the average [[Livejournal]].
He spent most of his spare time pretending to be a good mapper for a <s>nearly dead game by the name of Command & Conquer: Renegade</s> shit game, and <s>a mod called A Path Beyond</s> slightly less shit game. He stopped after getting an [[Life]].

In the past few years alone, he's managed to:

*Insult everyone and everything associated with black person
*Fall in love with someone who pretended to have died, then came back to life
*Invent a Japanese name for himself and not tell anyone it, then claim it was his real name and that his actual real name was a fake one

He owns both a [[Livejournal]] and a DeviantART page.

==I DESLIKE YOU==
A noteworthy earlier mistake he made was to make claims about his mapping talents that he could not keep, then attempt to save face by insulting a particular person who pointed this flaw out, in the most obvious way possible: Attacking their grammar and intelligence.
This led to the creation of the now famous "I DESLIKE YOU" post, in which the offended party wrote a poorly worded retort, attacking ACK for his lack of mapping skills.
The post, [http://www.renegadeforums.com/index.php?t=msg&th=252&start=0&rid=1504#msg_num_15 still viewable in the Renegade Public Forums' Hall of Fame], has been made into both a [http://www.n00bstories.com/hosted_files/ackreply/reading.swf flash presentation] and a [http://ackreply.ytmnd.com/ ytmnd].

==His real name==
Aircraftkiller made his real name known to all for years. Then, in a tragic series of events where someone figured out that his WOL account, Tankcmdr6 (the name he used to play with online for the game he made maps for), had the password "12345678" associated with it,
he was forced to change accounts. He picked a new name, "JupiterKS". Having always believed that he was a great Knight, sent from Jupiter to protect those he loves (when he finds them, that is), the name change was mostly self evident. However, when questioned about the "KS" part, he merely stated that it was his real name, which he wasn't going to tell anyone. 
Aircraftkiller's real name, at least according to the state of Florida, has the initials "J.H.". Aircraftkiller decided to pick a new real name for himself, a Japanese name most likely stemming for his love of Sailor Moon, and not tell anyone about it. Not his friends, his family, not even the state of Florida where he lived. He just thought up a new name and decided it was his real name from that moment on.

==His first girlfriend==
Aircraftkiller's first girlfriend was born with a near fatal lung disease, which nearly caused her to die on several occasions.
At some point, ACK managed to convince this poor soul that he wasn't that much of a douche and declared his love for her.
Then she died during a fatal operation on her lungs.
Months went by, ACK made regular updates to his [[Livejournal]] about how he could feel her presence watching over him. He wrote about how objects that had significant meaning to them both mysteriously disappeared, taken by her spirit to remind her of him.
He even had mysterious dreams, where he was protecting her as the Knight from Jupiter. This dream was clearly a sign that she was with him at all times, that she cared for him. Or so he wrote.
Then she came back to life.
His sort of now ex reappeared some time later, alive and well. As it turns out, the operation was a complete success and she was simply recovering the whole time, it was her sister that lied about her death, just so she could get close to the guy that they both were pursuing.
ACK, being the true douche that he is, saw this as a sign of true love and announced his undying love for her instead.
They broke up some time later.

==Sarah Meadows==
His second girlfriend, whom ACK decided that [http://www.apathbeyond.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=7119 he would marry] less than a month after meeting her, eventually got sick of him for being a lazy bastard who never helped around the house. It didn't help that Sarah was also a compulsive liar and a thief, who managed to steal money from Aircraftkiller's mother while Aircraftkiller and Sarah were living together. On top of that, it was also reported that Sarah was an Army deserter that barely managed to escape being prosecuted to PMITA prison.

==The Pretty Girl Within==
[[Image:ackwoman.jpg|thumb|Aircraftkiller's authenticated biography (cover shown)]]
Aircraftkiller, who claimed to be completely in love with his second girlfriend, bought her presents, as every good boyfriend would do. From ebay he bought the most beautiful dresses he could find. His second girlfriend, who for social integrity purposes will remain anonymous, received these dresses gladly.

One day, after a nap, she came into her bedroom and found her dresses, pantyhoses, shoes and more sprawled out on the bed. She assumed he was seeing a girl, which was not that bad in itself as the whole relationship was one big fa√ßade to make him look good to begin with. Looking for an explanation for this phenomenon, his girlfriend went looking for Aircraftkiller, who shortly thereafter walked into the front door in his underwear. When inquired as to his recent whereabouts, Aircraftkiller shrugged it off with a generic "Nowhere". As for the women's clothing on the bed, he told her they were meant for her.

Later on she was looking for some pictures from their shared digital camera on Aircraftkiller's computer, and ran across a folder that contained pictures that are best left unseen for everyone. Recoiling in horror, Aircraftkiller's second girlfriend laid her eyes on actual, high resolution photographs of Aircraftkiller wearing aforementioned dresses Aircraftkiller bought - not for her, but for himself.
[[Has_anyone_really_been_far_even_as_decided_to_use_even_go_want_to_do_look_more_like?|Upon inquiry]], Aircraftkiller explained his girlfriend that she wouldn't understand why he dressed up like the pretty little girl he secretly was on the inside, because she did not understand how it was to live as a man, knowing you should have been born a woman. In the process he blamed God, because He, in his infinite wisdom, decided that Aircraftkiller must know what it's like to be on the other side. Truly, the LORD works in mysterious ways.

==A Festering Boil==
The day following the airing of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNO6G4ApJQY Fox 11's investigative report on Anon], Aircraftkiller decided he'd prove his [[Retard|intellectual superiority]] to the world by making the following statement about [[Niggertits|4Chan]]:

'''''This whole "lulz" thing is so fucking stupid. I feel like my IQ drops a point every time I see someone say "im t3h lulz with OTHER INTERNET FUCKHATTERY BECAUSE I CAN'T FIGURE OUT ANYTHING WITTY ON MY OWN TO IMPRESS MY E-FRIENDS" 4chan is a gigantic festering boil on the ass of the Internet, and it hurts badly.''''' - Jonathan "Asscrackfiller" Holmes

But apparently that wasn't enough:

'''''I'm glad you didn't fall into the mind trap of Internet retardation. I think within a few years the people that say "lulz t3h teh moar" etc will be diagnosed with some kind of terminal illness, sad as it may be.''''' - Jonathan "Asscrackfiller" Holmes

The quotes can be found (yes, even after all the [[gay|incidents]] he's still permitted to view the [[proboards|forums]]) [http://www.apathbeyond.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=13977 here].

==His Starving cats==
[[Image:Starving_cats.jpg|thumb|Aircraftkiller's plea for money came in the shape of sympathy for his cats. Image [[subtext]] by Steppo]]
Aircraftkiller made a plea one day for donations. He stated that he, his girlfriend and his cats, were starving and needed money for food. He manages to rake in quite a considerable sum of money and it wasn't until Sarah decided to tell the community, that it came to light that he had lied about the whole thing. The donation money was spent on games and porn, which he didn't even have the decency to share with Sarah at the time.
