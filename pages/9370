[[Zoklet]] was a BBS forum that gained internet popularity after the fall of [[totse]]. Created by Zok, one of the admins of Totse, [[Plagiarism|Zoklet carries on Totse's legacy of free speech, and free information]]. Unfortunately around the beginning of July 2010 Wires had managed to ban or otherwise drive out all the good posters

==Zok Himself==

Get ready to read about the funniest nigger on the Internet. This guy's stupidity and ignorance will make you lol, rage, and facepalm at the same time.

As you may have already figured out, Zok is the owner of Zoklet. Whatever white bitch he's e-fucking over the Internet, he gives moderation powers to. As soon as his online relationship with Kinkou ended, she was demodded. Currently, Wires is the site's super moderator, much to everyone's dismay and confusion, but hey... She's Zok's current e-girlfriend. Yes, it's unethical, and won't help the website at all as everyone now knows as zoklet is in its final weeks because of this menace , but Zok's... well... he's like an African American version of [[chris-chan]].

In late 2009, one of the moderators Jackketch had to cease posting, due to fatal medical issues. He passed away in early December.

A few days later...

{{quote2|Please join me in welcoming kAtE-, wires, and psycho_8b as super moderators on zoklet.net. As many of you know, I also invited Jackketch to the position - he's yet to get back to me on that, but he's still being offered the position should he want it.|Zok, being his ignorant self}}

Zok is currently selling zoklet.net e-mail addresses, thinking people will actually pay seven dollars for one. He also has no problem trying to guilt everybody into clicking the banner ads, even though he continuously bans the few people who donate (for the most minor, ridiculous reasons).

Zoklet is due to close in mid September due to personal reasons according to Zok

==Zoklet Forums==

===Suggestions===

[[Image:Toothlessjoe.png|thumb|left|Make him stop...]]

The suggestions forum is Toothlessjoe's home ground. If you can dream it, he's suggested it. Wai? Because it gives the illusion
that he cares about the forums, resulting in a moderation position. Ever since 2004, Toothlessjoe has had wet dreams over becoming a moderator. [[Fail|Unfortunately, he has never achieved this goal.]]

When Totse migrated over to Zoklet in late January of 2009, black person was giving out moderator positions left and right. Unfortunately, [[lulz|Toothlessjoe hadn't learned of Zoklet until it was too late, and all of the moderating positions had been filled]].

In late 2009, Zok decided that having a Suggestions forum was a bad idea, so the forum was deleted. A few hours later, a new forum took its placed, titled Ideas and Features. Yes, really. The only difference was the title, paralleling the "Zoklet is really Totse" fiasco.

===Generally Speaking===
In a sense the backbone of Zoklet. Well, if Zoklet was a [[Metaphysicist|cripple]]. The forum contains almost 200,000 posts, and is modded by Expl0itz (ILOVEZOK), [[Shit|deus]] and Monkmaster. As with most General Chat forums, users come here to talk about anything that does not fit in any of the other boards. Zok encourages deep and interesting discussions, however nobody on Zoklet has an IQ over 75, so that could never happen.

{{quote2|wat i can't hav chapped lips motherfucka??|A deep and interesting GS post by Rainycity}}

Apparantly trolling is not allowed, yet reading many of the threads one can easily see that this is a huge incorrect statement. Many [http://www.zoklet.net/bbs/showthread.php?t=65127 "RIP" threads] are created when a user doesn't post on Zoklet for more than 2 hours, [[Only 2 percent|most]] of them made by faggot user Daily, who trolls users into believing he is a hot and dirty whore who [[pretty cool guy|doesn't afraid of anything.]]

===Pissin' Each Other Off===

Known as PEOO - Pissin' Each Other Off is where you go to [[bitch]] and [[whine]] about how you got [[butthurt]] by someone else in another thread. Reading more than one topic in here a day can cause you to lose all hope for humanity. It is modded by [[Spectral]], who is a 95-year old emo faggot.

====I got infracted and I'm MAD!!====

PEOO is home to a sub forum; ''I got infracted and I'm MAD!!'' (Which is also modded by [[Spectral]])
Similar to bitching and moaning about other people, people come in this section to bitch and moan at the mods about giving them infractions.

===Bat Country===

[[Image:Pillpopper.png|thumb|left|A typical PM for Angry Blue Bird of Death]]

While GS is the backbone of the forum, BC is the miscarried fetus. Containing a quarter of a million posts, it is the most active board on the forum. Boasting over 30,000 topics, and it is modded by MandatorySuicide and Euda (former mods include admins wires and Fish). Bat Country's community consists of weirdos, junkies, whores, trannies, stalkers, the obese, Communists, pedos, faggots, the suicidal and the bored.

Bat Country is largely shit upon by the larger community, despite the face BC is the most popular forum on zoklet. Though, BC is a haven for trolls. Trolls from bc often prey on those in the main forums.


===Love, Lust, and Relationships===

A forum where virgins discuss sex and various sexual fetishes, despite having no knowledge of how to perform intercourse. This forum has <s>four</s> three moderators which are: <s>jackketch, [[Silverfuck]]</s> Unwyred, psycho_8b, and wires. Former mod jackketch got cancer and died and Silverfuck (aka robinhoody) quit zoklet. Unwyred replaced these two.

Blunderful was one of the top contributors to this forum, thinking it was his blog, and is subsequently laughed at for his incredible [[fail]] at the game of mating. Despite never getting laid, he still got more action than 95% of the Zoklet community. His lovable loser-type threads resulted in the attention of female users on the board, thinking he is "OH SO KAWAII". IRL however, the women were fucking afraid, as he spent his dates talking about [[rape]]. Yes, really.

''"I said stupid things on the date though, as some of you know. I couldn't make a conversation - I talked about stupid shit like rape, etc."''

Sick of him getting more attention than her, Wires banned Blunderful from LLR, and he was never seen again. Yes, the bitch actually banned someone because he was getting too much attention. Further proof that Zok and the mods want Zoklet to fail. 

Love, Lust and Relationships allows all forms of sex, including... Well, look out for JoePedo, An incredibly smart pedophile who isn't afraid to announce his love of little kids. [[Chris Hansen]]'s arch-enemy. He uses the excuse that all kids love sex, and that the media has lied to everyone. Nobody can actually remember wanting to take a cock when they were four years old, however JoePedo thinks otherwise.

Jackketch is the forum's skinhead, who has a crippled kid and a wife with no breasts. He recently got cancer, and had to leave the forum. Nobody cared, but I guess it should be noted here. ... *cough*.

===Not For Human Consumption===

This is where all the junkies and stoners of Zoklet post. Rizzo in the Box, a test subject for LD.50s of various substances, posts his stories here. A noteworthy thread includes "Bump When High", however the users are too high to realize that the thread is stickied.

===Paranormal===

"Mystical and the paranoid - a combination of alchemy, crystal healing, psychic powers, Old and New Age thinking!" - Aka, the bullshit forum. 

Greyfox, also known as [http://www.zoklet.net/bbs/showthread.php?t=68430 The Zodiac Killer] is the moderator shaman of Paranormal, and actually believes the bullshit that gets spewed here. He believes in spells, magic, and thinks he can tell the future. To summarize, Greyfox is a 60 year old man with an ego bigger than [[Tr1p]]'s nose.

He once held a contest with his used underwear as first prize, expecting people would be delighted to win such a thing.
''
"Regulars will know that I sometimes give things away to other members--everything from rolling papers to an emerald, most recently a cockroach finger puppet.

I now have the perfect giveaway for Bat Country--Batman underwear. Yep--I have two pairs of boxer shorts--one has the classic Batman logo in black and yellow, the other has The Dark Knight. Both are flannel, size medium (32-34 waist), clean but previously owned. (I collect and distribute clothing to local low-income folks, which is how I came upon the shorts.)

So--in case you want one, post and say why. I haven't decided on the criteria for winners, but I must limit this to USA addresses only."''

He once made a thread actually stating that anger was the same thing as fear, which resulted in [http://www.zoklet.net/bbs/showthread.php?t=56744 lulz]. His infamous quote, "Angry? Be advised that anger is fear announced." has become a meme on the boards. Memes? Be advised that memes is unoriginality announced.

Greyfox has a number of character traits that will either make you lol, or disturb you.

* Despite promoting peace and harmony, he holds the profession of a weapons salesman. Yes, really. He also mods "Right to Bear Arms".
* Lives in a cabin, in the middle of the forest, with no electricity. This is more than likely to hide from the police, due to his profession as The Zodiac Killer. He has to travel long distances to get to the local library, to post on Zoklet.
* Has admitted to having sex with over 100 people (note: people, not women).

==Abandoned Neutrons==

[http://www.freewebs.com/thebikini/neutrons.htm Abandoned Neutrons] is the unofficial forum webcomic, starring the users of the Community, and created by Blunderful. Once Wires banned Blunderful however, the comics ceased production. God, Wires is a bitch. She was probably happy with this though, as the strips contained a countless amount of "lol wires miscarried" jokes.

===The Fish Trilogy===

Fish, the forum's wannabe chink, has his own trilogy of comics in the series, making fun of his retarded plan to take over the forum. When everyone became aware of this, he disappeared for half a year, hoping everyone would forget by the time he returned. Because Zoklet is made up of such brainless morons, of course they forgot.

===Butthurt===

A lot of the moderators and bitches have experienced high amounts of butthurt over their portrayal in the comics. Wires even went as far as to remove one of the comics, which spent the entire plot making light of her miscarriage (If you're still wondering why Wires is a mod, it's because she bj'd Zok during a moderator meetup).

Expl0itz actually changed his username to ILOVEZOK, so new members wouldn't think he's the transsexual crybaby in the comics. We're not even kidding. He actually changed his fucking username, to protect his image on an Internet forum.

===The End===

Blunderful returned to make the final comic in 2010, which involved the community suing Zok for fucking up all the time. In the end, everyone died in a murder suicide, keeping with the spirit of Totse, something Zoklet has failed to do.

==Toothlessjoe Photoshopping==

Toothlessjoe once posted a photo of himself, which resulted in [[over 9000]] photoshops.

<center><youtube>1K1UUiq9NPY</youtube></center>

Photoshopping his face has become a national pastime on the boards.

==Afroman==

Afroman is ProjectPat's cat. It is considered by him alone to be the mascot of the forum.
Afroman has gained many fans rapidly. Afroman and ProjectPat have sex weekly.

UPDATE: ProjectPat was [[IRL]] [[pwned]] when another user emailed sexually obscene images of ProjectPat and Afroman to his mother. See: [http://www.zoklet.net/bbs/showthread.php?t=104783 this].
