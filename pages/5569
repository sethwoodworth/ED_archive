A [[MySpace Adventure]] is tantamount to any other trolling campaign - wide-spread damage is dealt, through the [[MySpace]] medium

== Fun Ideas ==
* Send love letters to girls in relationships, so you can get their boyfriends to message you like [[internet tough guys]].  A++++
* Stalk people
* Use a secondary page to leave an ominous legal warning about another page, i.e. "'''STATE POLICE WARNING TO MYSPACERS !!!!!! Please read this.....I hope that all of my Friends Post this and help keep our myspace friends safe. State police warning for online: Please read this "very carefully"..then send it out to all the people online that you know. Something like this is nothing to be taken casually; this is something you DO want to pay attention to.If a person with the screen-name of (insert [[lolcow]] here) or (insert [[lolcow]] email here) or (insert [[lolcow]] website here) contacts you, do not reply DO NOT talk to this person; do not answer any of his/her instant messages or e-mail. Whoever this person may be, he/she is a suspect in the disappearances of at least 56 people (so far) contacted through the Internet. Please send this to all the friends on your buddy list and ask them to pass this on, as well. This screen-name was seen on Yahoo, AOL, AIM, and Excite so far. This is not a joke! Send to everyone you know! Ladies, this is serious, Gentlemen, PLEASE let your Lady Friends know....IF WE CAN PASS ON JOKES, SURELY WE CAN PASS ON A WARNING THAT MAY SAVE A LIFE! Please repost. This can also be found at www.NBC.com'''"
* Spread Jew propaganda
* Troll Midwest [[wiggers]] by questioning their [[gay|sexuality]] and/or [[fail|fighting skills]]. Accuse them of performing [[fellatio]] on Vanilla Ice.
* [[lol]] at [[legal threats]].
* Make a female account and add as many girls only [[lesbian]] accounts to your friends as you can. Save all of their hawt lesbian pics and put them on [[4chan]]. With a different account message them telling them that they are hot and should consider going into hardcore, linking them to the 4chan thread. It'll only work if they're online when you message them/make the 4chan thread.
*Search myspace for an attractive girl/boy, upload those pictures as your own on a different account, (Make sure you don't know them and they don't know you) and fool someone into a loving you, then "dump" them in whatever fashion pleases you for lulz
