<s>'''GreenRaeper'''</s> Green[[Rapist]] is a total eccentric, head [[Admin|(mal)administrator]] of [[WikiFur]], and well known furfag. He's one of those e-heroes that loves waving the banner for all the [[furries]] who are weak, helpless, obese and ''still'' virgins. He ain't no fucking [[William Wallace]] though. Instead of hiding behind shitty facepaint in a blockbuster movie, he likes to crawl behind his grotesque [[fursona]], all the while treating the rest of the 'net like utter trash.

He also likes to claim, probably falsely, to have a close association with [[Jimbo Wales|King Jimbo]] of WikiLand, and does not hesitate to use his supposed “friends in high places” to win petty arguments over inconsequential shit, ''especially'' on [[Wikipedia]] and [[Wikia]] &mdash; where he is notorious for outing users and exposing them as [[troll]]s. One possible reason for this, which has been speculated over more than once, is due to him suffering from an urge to clean up the internets while keeping within Wikipedia's rubbery and flaccid [[CYOC|“Choose your own Interpretation”]] rules via sophisms and quoting irrelevant Jimbo-isms, but the ''real'' motivation behind his overbearing need to rub his elite buddies in the faces of those who are unworthy of such famous company is, quite simply, because he is an ostentatious [[turd]]. A turd with fur, that is.

==Infuriating mannerisms that GreenRaeper just doesn't get the fucking hint about==
{{quote|I was an angry little norn. I'm less angry now, but still.|GreenRaeper on Wikia's New Style}}

GreenRaeper, throughout the cyberwebs, has been noted to have a number of infuriating mannerisms that showcase his patronizing, sycophantic yes-man attitude towards all that is [[serious business]]. What a [[fucktard]].

*GreenRaeper, like any internet prick, is liable to use a lot of fucking annoying [[emoticons]] rather liberally. And by liberally, it is meant that in any :-) fucking :-) response that he considers total [[pwnage]] :-) to :-) your :-) [[Some argue|much more sound :-), reasonable :-) argument]], he'll use them.
*He openly promotes the idea of a [[Closet Furry|furry closet]], in order to make [[13 year old boy]]s keep their sexual deviance to themselves. While this is an admirable cause, the [[Internet-IRL Warfare|occurrence of furries having their lives shattered]] and other [[Furcarthyism]] by being disowned is sharply down.
*GR has a fierce attachment to [[WikiFur]], where he is head administrator. One can use this to [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WikiFur (2nd nomination)|provoke a lot condescending arguments and drama]], and expose him for the meanie he [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:GreenReaper/Archive1#Why.3F really is] &mdash; fyi, it wasn't [[Miltopia]] who first started garnering votes. [[lol|:-)]].
:* [[no life|He's a mod on]] inkbunny.
:* he also is [http://forums.vivisector.org/index.php?action=profile;u=14 member #14] of [[CrushYiffDestroy|Vivisector]]. 

*GreenRaeper, funnily enough, is also totally and utterly [[virgin|frigid]]. In #wikifur, his wikia's [[IRC]] channel on [[freenode]], he does not permit [[yiff]]ing at all. Given the [[sick fuck|normal]] furry's usual fucklust, one ''just has'' to wonder whether he feels any connection with the fandom at all, and isn't simply hanging out with because he has no [[IRL]] friends.
*What an attention whoring cunt. GreenRaeper, just like [[:Category:People|anyone else]] with a terminal case of [[unwarranted self-importance]] and [[shameless self promotion]], feels the animalistic urge to whore out his [[Wiki]]. [[Typical|For example]], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_June_5&diff=prev&oldid=136332645 here he decides to link to WikiFur], ''despite'' TOW having a vastly better article on LJ, and despite the fact that nobody gives a fuck about [[Shit nobody cares about|which furfag uses what]].
*GreenRaeper is also a known [[pedophile]] who has a insatiable lust for young [[CP|boys]] in fursuits, whom he lures back to his hotel room at conventions, then proceeds to sodomize with a soldering iron for hours on end.
