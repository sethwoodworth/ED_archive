In  perfect world we know that many things wouldn't exist;  [[faggotry]], [[jews]], [[niggers]], etc. Alas, we live in a world were these things do exist and while many the [[anon|internet hero]] does his part to stem the tides of fail, there exist a cesspool of pure unadulterated [[anti-lulz]]. A site that is [[Adrian Chen]], mixed with yahoo comment boards with a coating of [[niggers]] for extra fail. A website that shows not only why niggers in fact, [[Nigga Know Technology|don't know technology]], but why they should be and rightfully are forbidden from the internet. 


== The Site ==
[[TOW]] describes Media Take Out as a [[blog]]-style gossip website catering to [[niggers|African Americans]]. This in of itself is a horrid trait to have and frankly quite stupid, as it's common knowledge that [[there are no niggers on the internet]] and blogs are typically [[faggotry]] filled bore sessions, but this description like most things on [[TOW]] is a lie. Mediatakeout is in fact, the [[retarded]], [[faggot]], black person of [[Drudge Report|Drudge Report, Huffington Post]], and [[BET]].Mediatakeout boasts that it is "The Most Visited Urban Website in the World" and has an Alexa ranking of 1,497 as of January 28, 2009. This would be impressive until you see that the comment section is filled with would be [[trolls]], [[spammers]] and general [[faggotry]] of that nature.

== Headlines and stories ==
At 1,497 in the Alexa ranking there must be some saving grace, nothing could be just constant stupidity and niggers right? [[No]]. Headlines on the site will start without fail with one of the following(in [[ALL CAPS]]): 

'''[[Cute Shit|AWWWWW]]'''

'''[[HA HA HA, OH WOW|DAYUMMMMMMMMMMN!!!!!!]]'''

'''[[drama|DRAAAAA-MAA!!!!]]'''

'''[[BAWWWWW|OH NO!!]]'''

'''[[wambulance|SAD NEWS]]'''

'''[[goatse|NUN-UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!]]'''

'''[[wtf|WTF!!!!???]]'''

or if all else fails, '''x ALL CAPS y (insert random nigger saying)'''

The story will then be grammatical errors, tabloid journalism, oh and for fun gratuitous spelling errors.
