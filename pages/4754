'''Late Night Shots''' ("LNS") is a [[Washington, DC]]-based [[social networking]] web site geared towards [[social climber]]s. It is a [[friends only]] site and you must be invited by another [[faggot|member]] in order to join. The site has a simple [[4chan|image board]], [[message board]], and various private messaging/[[online dating]] features. Like [[4chan]], the message board option is [[anonymous]], meaning anyone can post under any name.

The point of LNS is to find [[whore]]s that [[asking for it|want you to rape them]] and then [[Chris Hansen|meet up with them]] at bars. The next day, you have to post a thread saying how awesome it was and [[Pictures plz|post pics]] while everyone [[circle jerk|talks about how awesome you are]].

==[[faggots|Members]]==
Late Night Shots members are typically:
*[[Prep]]pies
*[[WASP]]s
*[[White People]]
*[[Your Mom]]
*[[Your Mom|Cougars]]
*A few [[niggas]] that [[nice try|have money]]
*[[rape|Rapists]]
*[[Attention Whore]]s

On [[at least 100 years ago|July 12, 2007]], [[Old Media|Washington City Paper]] published a [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=2008 cover story] about LNS written by [[whore|Angela Valdez]]. The article basically [[namefag]]ged some LNS users who asked [[bitch|Angela]] to perform [[anal sex|sexual]] [[fellatio|acts]] on [[cock|them]]. As soon as it was posted and the [[Waaaambulance]] had been called, [[troll]]s, [[anon]] and [[Douchebag|internet tough guy]]s descended upon the comments section. Anon summarized the article:
{{quote|Dear Diary, The cool kids made fun of me again today. I HATE THEM SO MUCH!!! When I grow up I'm going to get them all back by getting a minimum wage job at a 3rd-rate local free newspaper and writing mean things about them. That will show them. Sincerely, Angela Valdez|Jul. 12, 2007, at 2:26 pm}}

Many [[lawyer]]s have posted responses as well: 
{{quote|Let the record show that I was at the party where [[emo|Angela]] [[whore|Valdez]] was [[black]]out drunk, overly intoxicated and spilling drinks on people at the LNS party she so casually mentions. I am shocked that she has chosen to libel all parties involved, especially in the age of [[Google]] when these persons, who did not want to speak with her, literally will lose jobs because of [[namefag|this]]...much less over words they did not speak. Interesting that when you [[Google]] her [[pussy|name]], she has [[Joe Biden|plagiarized another writer's work]]. The most offensive part of this article is that nearly everyone she came into contact with treated her extremely well. This is the most unprofessional piece of writing I have read in a long time. She is a [[NO U|pathetic, unethical, and unprofessional person]] who should locked up in a jail cell with other duplicitous, no-talented clowns who propagate falsehoods.|[[Internet Tough Guy|Sally Hemmings]]|Jul. 12, 2007, at 12:17 pm}}

Much drama surrounded the article. Many [[internet tough guy]]s came out of the woodwork to defend Mexican and [[baw]] about the assholes that inhabit LNS culture. Others 

{{quote|As many of you know, there was an article about LNS which appeared yesterday in the Washington City Paper, a local free newspaper. Unfortunately, outlets such as The City Paper, [http://wonkette.com/238948/great-schism-of-07-late-night-shots-locks-undesirables-in-open-forum Wonkette], [http://whyihatedc.blogspot.com/2006/06/this-is-mean-for-sake-of-meanness.html WhyIHateDC] and [http://jezebel.com/gossip/grody-old-party/fucking-republicans-as-bad-as-you-think-277742.php other DC blogs] have used LNS as a means to incite their base readers. As we have experienced, the characterizations of LNS made by these groups are [[Karl Rove|highly biased and often completely distorted to fit a negative agenda]].

When LNS and its events have been profiled by respected publications such as the Washington Post, Washingtonian, Washington Life, and several college newspapers, the story presented is dramatically different. The stories are positive and provide a [[fair and balanced|fair and honest]] reflection about LNS and its [[faggots|members]]. LNS has been profiled [[over 9000|over a dozen]] times in legitimate media outlets such as the Washington Post.

We are very proud of both what we have built and the wide-ranging group of people LNS has attracted. The continued growth of the site in terms of membership, daily logins and traffic illustrates that LNS is something that people in Washington DC enjoy and want to be a part of. Contrary to the portrayal in local tabloids, LNS is comprised of individuals in their 20's, 30's and 40's who enjoy interacting with one another, exploring the DC social [[scene]], and sharing [[AIDS|laughs]], both [[OL|on the website]] and [[IRL|off]].|LNS.com official response}}
