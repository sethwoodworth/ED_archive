Hatedwerewolf

[http://www.youtube.com/HatedWerewolf Hatedwerewolf] was a [[YouTube]] [[Furry]] who gained attention after crusading for [[Otherkin]] civil rights and subsequent attention whoring, becoming well known for [[Emo|passionate arguments]] involving her beliefs. Because of this, she has since become one of the top targets of the [[Youtube furry war|YouTube Furry War]], as well as being the center of some of the most YouTube drama in recent memory. See [[ScarredFurry]] for [[Sockpuppet|shocking revelations]].

==Beginnings==
The long, sad tale of Hatedwerewolf started with an insult directed at one of her friends by troll atscubaguysteve23. During conversation, [[FCTC|atscubaguysteve23]] came to the conclusion that said friends [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daoism religion] "sucked and was pure faggotory". Completely [[offended|offended]] by the [[Truth|opinion]], Hatedwerewolf decided it was her duty to defend her friend with [[NO U|well researched arguments]], along the way revealing her own [[Shit nobody cares about|spiritual beliefs]]. Confused by the fact that someone may not be completely convinced of the fact that she was a full fledged [[Furry|werewolf]] and appalled that someone would [[I did it for the lulz|demean]] her for them, Hatedwerewolf decided on a course of [[Butthurt|swift action]].

=="Lycans"==
Hatredwerewolf saw the movie Underworld, which she thought was [[Goatse|cool]]. So she started calling werewolves "lycans", which is the stupidest fucking thing ever considering that she probably doesn't know what lycanthropy even is outside of retarded movies and shitty fanfiction. Next, she's going to play ''[[Oblivion]]'' and start calling vampires "porphyric hemophiliacs".

===[[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|Fuck you, I'm a werewolf]]===
In response to those who question her beliefs, Hatedwerewolf [[Lie|carefully mapped out]] her thoughts and responded to the skeptics with [[2 girls 1 cup|a video of unquestionable truth]]. As evidenced by comments below, the video was clearly [[Fail| a success]].

==Threats==
Being a [[Fucktard|mighty Lycan]], Hatedwerewolf had an enormous amount of [[rage]] building inside of her. Whenever trolled, she made a series of [[retarded|clever]] comebacks and other means of [[Internet tough guy|self defense]]. Some examples include;

==Hatedwerewolf [[Asking for it|Asks For It]]==
Recently, Hatedwerewolf decided to try her hand at [[suicide|counter-trolling]]. In addition to spreading her trademark [[Anti-lulz|wit]] to active trolls who comment on her videos, she issued an open challenge to  [[Anonymous|anyone]] willing [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE|to participate]].

<center><youtube>12-I44QMGMo</youtube><br /></center>

==The Evidence Revealed!==
After months of [[Shit|well though out argument]], Hatedwerewolf announced that since there is no evidence anywhere of anything she is talking about, she wins. After searching [[Wikipedia|every]] [[Photobucket#Photobucket|website]] [[Urbandictionary.com|imaginable]] and still coming up empty, Hatedwerewolf could only fathom that the Lycans are so secret, that even one of their own could not find any proof of their existence at all. Thus, the complete lack of evidence is itself the evidence! Despite not finding any information of her own kind, she was able to find the true spelling and pronunciation, Lycaoen([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saosin#Origin_of_name Li-say-on]), which has to be true, because no human could ever think up such a name.

<center><youtube>IBLbZfko7rw</youtube><br /></center>

However, it should also be noted that [http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr20LUYoUmE people just as stupid] as Hatedwerewolf know she's full of shit, and encourage trolling her.

==[[Whiteknight|FangXXV]]==
With every [[No girls on the internet|female online]], there will be the inevitable rush of men ready to defend her honor, whether or not she's [[obese|BBW]], [[Fugly|less than beautiful]], or simply [[Trap|not up to society's standards]]. Fat [[goth]] furs are no exception. Enter [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=FangXXV FangXXV]. Seeing Hated's [[Lollercoaster|reasoning]] for Lycan civil rights, Fang first greeted her with "hey babe", and was immediately greeted with;

[[Image:Babewolf.jpg]]

Down, but not out, Fang decided that he would simply bide his time and wait till Hateds then [[Nice try|boyfriend]] would ditch, leaving her all to himself. Fang then begun[[NO U|counter-trolling]] those who mock Hatedwerewolf, hoping that she would accept his advances, and was quite [[Internet tough guy|determined]] in doing so. Eventually, he wised up to while he could delete whatever was said to him, his lulzy comments were public for everyone to see. Realizing he had lost, FangXXV disabled comments on his page, and no longer attempted to combat the "humens" on any videos from that point on. Since [[Fail|abandoning]] his quest for the love of Hatedwerewolf, and maintains that he had simply [[I did it for the lulz|did it for the lulz]]. One down...

==Just When It Couldn't Get Sadder...==
Since the retreat of FangXXV, it appeared as if two more have stepped up in hopes of gaining Hatedwerewolf's favor. Playing it safer than Fang, [http://au.youtube.com/profile?user=KainDFTLycan Kain Lycan] and [http://au.youtube.com/profile?user=SethMcScythe Seth McScythe] climbed the ranks as Hatedwerewolf's "brothers". Two videos were created, in hopes of intimidating the trolls, and to give the appearance that the two were in competition for the favor of Hatedwerewolf. While Seth decided to go [http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=UaQCSAUg5Mg the black route], Kain took it upon himself to [http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=QyeOPn53zj0 politely ask trolls to refrain from bullying], while appearing to take a shot at his rival. Seth, [http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=FgC0-bosZUo the deep, poetic] boy he is, took offense to the comment, and it seemed otherkin infighting had begun...

And then, [http://au.youtube.com/profile?user=MarcShadeLycaoen MarcShadeLycaoen] showed up to join the carnival of shame. Another "cousin" of Hatedwerewolf's, she had previously warned of Marc's growing anger toward the trolls. Unlike Seth and Kain, Marc is quite outspoken about his faggotry, and has advertised it at every opportunity. With his appearance, it was assumed that even more misspelled, emo-filled slideshows were sure to come. Just as expected, a video was made in an attempt to combat the trolls. What followed was an unholy collage of homoeroticism, Hawthorne Heights music, and [[Jack Spicer]]. Words cannot express the epic fail [http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=04xVb-oPRs4 contained in this video]. Still not satisfied that the faggotry had been spread far enough, "raver and [[13-year-old boy]] "[http://au.youtube.com/profile?user=KodiBrekDanceLycaoen KodiBrekDanceLycaoen] appeared and threatened to punch people through his computer screen.


And then it all unraveled. As if identical grammar and threats weren't convincing enough to raise suspicion, Hatedwerewolfs [[deviantART]] page was discovered, and along with it, "Seth's" poetry, and even a picture... That's right. As if Hatedwerewolf couldn't get any worse, she actually [[Sock puppet|sockpuppeted]] an entire "family" of YouTube accounts to give the illusion of support. Apparently watching this very article, Hatedwerewolf had posted a bulletin (posing as "Seth") in which she denied any use of sockpuppet accounts. In addition, after seeing a picture showing all of the "tribes" accounts to be online and offline nearly simultaneously, she has begun to use only one account a day, hoping to cover her ass. That, like everything Hatedwerewolf has ever set out to accomplish, has failed epically. No word on what she hoped to accomplish by arguing with herself through two sockpuppeted accounts...

However,the greatest surprise was yet to come, as it was later found out that Hatedwerewolf was, herself, a sockpuppet account for [[ScarredFurry]]. Deciding she didn't want to directly get involved in the [[Youtube furry war|YouTube Furry War]], ScarredFurry actually sockpuppeted Hatedwerewolf to apparently keep her primary account safe.

==End and Rebirth==
As time passed, Hatedwerewolf began to spread her faggotry across YouTube less and less, and eventually stopped showing up at all. It seemed as though YouTube had lost one of the most impressive and juicy lulzcows in quite some time. However, as HWW posted less and less, [[ScarredFurry]] began to post more and more. Eventually, SF began to take on the exact mannerisms of "her sister", eventually admitting that '''she herself''' was a Lycan as well. And thus, the cycle begins a new. While it is expected that "Hatedwerewolf" will still make an appearance every now and then, the primary focus is on ScarredFurry.

== Additional lulz ==
As if all this wasn't bad enough, it was revealed Hatedwerewolf is a writer of dark disturbing fiction, like all good [[emo|spiritual]] kids.

A sampling of her work;

'''Blooded Werewolves'''

''At Night In The Town Of Purity:'' 

''Sara: HEY DANTE!''

''Dante: yea?'' 

''Sara: you going to school tomarrow?''

''Dante: [[IDK, my BFF Jill?|idk]]''

''Sara: well u havent been in [[school]] for a week have you been skipping?''

''Dante: duh'' 
'''*suddenly dante sees the moon over head t is full and red . its a blood moon*'''

''Dante: umm ill see ya later *runs into the woods*''

''Sara: DANTE ! ....y does he always run away from me after the beginning of the full moon?''

''Dante: DAMN Y NOW?....*falls to ground* OW DAMN WHAT TRIPPED ME!?!'' 

'''*hissing noises*'''

''Dante: O.O DAMN NOT A RED WOLF!''

Red Wolf Grunt: '''*snicker and laughs*''' ''hello Dante...'' 



Her dark and insightful poem "''The Empty Organ''":

[[emo|''hark...the love less organ the sadest one yet my heart an empty valentines bag a half eaten oreo...a rusty razorblade....all of witch have no use left...hatred like the adrenal glads replace my heart...when ill love again will be in milleniums...if i could only live that long...i may not survive after dawn...for from my wrists the blood is drawn'']]

Truly, she is the next Anne Rice, if Anne Rice was 14, [[Aspergers|mildly retarded]] and a [[Furry|furfag]].

==The Crocker Connection==

[[Image:Crockerconnection.jpg|thumb|right|Really, should anyone be surprised?]]

Hatedwerewolf had surprised many trolls with the consistency of her [[faggotry]], updating videos regularly and continuing to offer trolls delicious lulz. While this is uncommon for most furries, who prefer to take [[Fail|the high road]] and [[Quitting IRC forever|ignore the trolls]], Hatedwerewold is no ordinary furry. In addition to being the #1 Otherkin fag of YouTube, Hatedwerewolf is an admitted fan and spiritual successor of fellow [[YouTube Super Fags|YouTube fag]] [[Chris Crocker]]. By being an enormous [[attention whore]] and being outcasted even by her own [[Furry|community]], Hatedwerewolf has shown herself to be one good meltdown way from [[An hero|total stardom]].
