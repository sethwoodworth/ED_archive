The expression '''"Fixed"''' (alternatively: fxt, FXT, fixt, or Fix'D on [[Gamefaqs]]) is [[netspeak]]/[[chanspeak]] used primarily as [[sarcastic]] "helpful" [[advice]] to indicate that the quoted [[n00b|poster]] is a complete [[fucktard|moron]] and/or is otherwise [[doing it wrong]]. In some cases the edit will have been transformed into an [[Pwnt|insult]] at the n00b, but it is possible that there are still [[Nice guy|kind people]] left on the [[internets]]. However, [[Old meme|it's less likely than you might think.]]

Fixed or fixt are both common edit summaries on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], usually referring to one fixing broken templates, or buggy code on a page, etc.

There's a [[Music]] label/multi-label [[Indie]] distribution agency called '''[http://www.fixtonline.com FiXT]''' that features a lot of [[DDR]]-esque music, oldfag [[Industrial]] musicians, and slight [[Mac]]-[[fapping]] that was created literally because the creator of said label, Celldweller founder [[Trent Reznor|Klay Scott]], would call his music/production shit "FiXT" when finished.
