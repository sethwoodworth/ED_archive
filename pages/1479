Chibiabos
'''Chibiabos''' (aka ''Ironhoof'', ''Fortivirago'' and ''[[User_talk:Klondikebar|Klondike]]'') is an [[insane]] [[old people|greymuzzled]] [[zoophile|dog rapist]] and one of noted [[furry|dogfucker]] Ebonlupus's former fuckbuddies. Currently infamous for using inane [[Wikifur]] edits as a weapon against the noble few seeking an end to [[Furry|furfaggotry]] and also to pursue his varied paranoical obsessions.

Targets of his masturbatory Wikifur edits include Sibe and [[CrushYiffDestroy|the Monolithic Antifurs]].  '''Chibiabos''' shows great promise as a [[victim|professional victim]] with a capacity for gonzo paranoia easily manipulated by those in search of [[lulz]].

An analysis (although one not too deep, due to risk catching a case of teh phurphag) shows the "Chibiabos" persona to be completely, totally and utterly infatuated by itself and it's crusade/agenda. One will find on the archive of his website, that every sentence includes either a direct or implied reference to himself and his perceived greatness in all things. This, in concert with his obvious agenda of a near-fascist view of "Fur Supremacy" which, incidentally, reveals a deep seated and dangerous loathing of "normals", should be the ultimate goal of any who are on a LulzQuest.

==Wikifur hilarity==
Incited by being outed as a dog rapist, Chibiabos conducted a loleriffic campaign on the Talk pages of WikiFur against CrushYiffDestroy and its minions before eventually being banned by the admins. See [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/User_talk:Chibiabos here] and [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Talk:Crush!_Yiff!_Destroy!/archive1 here] and [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/User_talk:Mitch here] for some of the lulz.

== Famous quotes ==
*[[no|"Bestiality /is/ natural. It doesn't take much research to discover interspecies relationships, and cave paintings depicting it predate the theoretical beginnings of Christian mythology by millenia. Intolerance to others' sexuality, on the other paw, is unnatural. I take it that you feel no one should be allowed to be zoophile, nor tolerate those who are?"]]

*(Referring to [[Zeta toy|Zeta Toys]]) "Artificial means man-made. Humans could never come up with anything so heavenly as a canine phallus."

*"Only felons, thieves, and drug users support Sibe."

*(Referring to [[Fchan]]) "I'd like to see it redirect to null. I'm sick of these pirate sites passing themselves off as Dog's gift to the furry fandom."

== ED: A Public Service ==
Due to this page, Chibiabos has been banned from at least [http://devils-orchard.wikidot.com/ one] unrelated website for being a dogfucker.
