Just like the [[LINK MAH BOIIIII|''Zelda'' games for Philips CD-I]], '''''Hotel Mario''''' for the same console is another one of [[YouTube]]'s shitty [[YouTube Poop]] materials.

==Basic information==
[[Srsly]], [[noone]] actually gives a [[shit]] about the game itself. It's the cutscenes that make this game pointless enough for [[faggots|YouTubers]] to use the material in their videos. Apart from those scenes [[Rap|making your fucking ears bleed]] due the crappy sound quality and giving you [[seizure|seizures]] because of all the [[Lie|AWESOME GRAPHICS]], [[at least 100|100%]] of the poops are [[unfunny]] and made by [[newfags]]. [[YouTube Poop]]s of ''Hotel Mario'' most of the time also include [[LINK MAH BOIIIII|''Zelda'' stuff]] or Robotnik's [[PINGAS]]. This equals twice the [[anti-lulz]] and none of those videos are really worth watching. All of the Poopers have downloaded their material from the same freaking site anyway. 

==Plot of the story==
[[Cool story bro|As Mario and Luigi enter the gate of the so-called "Mushroom Kingdom" in hopes of meeting Princess Peach, Bowser pops up behind a wall observing the two plumbers and unleashes his maniac laugh. After walking a long way while talking about the princess being nice inviting them over for a picnic, they finally arrive at "Klub Koopa Rezort", while Luigi already seems to be hungry for lotsa spaghetti. Unfortunately, they weren't capable of encountering Princess Peach anywhere around there. Instead, they found a letter of Bowser saying that the Mushroom Kingdom has been taken over by Bowser and his Koopalings and the princess is now supposed to be hidden in one of Bowser's seven Koopa-Hotels]]. Needless to say, the two brothers now must rescue the princess of all costs. Luigi even tells the player/viewer to help them. Will they succeed? Will they defeat Bowser and rescue Peach? Will Luigi finally get his lotsa spaghetti? Well, no one really cares.

'''TL;DR version''': Kidnapped Peach is kidnapped.

==Quotes==

Despite the Poops being horrendously [[unfunny]] and full of [[AIDS]], the ''Hotel Mario'' game would happen to [[LOL WUT|confuse the player/viewer]] with the pointless sayings of Mario and Luigi. Some of which are:

*"Nice of the [[whore|princess]] to invite us over for a [[Fellatio|dicklick]], [[gay]] [[WEEGEE|Luigi]]?"
(Yeah, yeah. We all know it's actually "picnic". But, [[srsly]], [[no one|who gives a fuck]]?)

*"I hope she made lotsa [[Cakefarts|BURGERS]]!"

*"[[WEEGEE|Luigi]], look! It's from [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|Spongebob Gay Pants]]!"

*"[[TL;DR|Dear pesky faggots, the Koopalings and I have taken over Rock Bottom. The princess is now a bitch at one of my seven hundred-billion Koopa-hotels! I dare you to fuck her, if you can!]]"

*"We gotta find the [[whore|princess]]!"

*"And [[YOU]] gotta help us!"

*"If you need instr (constipation)'''uctions''' on how to get through the hotels, check out the enclosed instruction book[[LOLDONGS|.]]"

*"[[No means yes|NO...?]]"

*"Where there's [[Marijuana|smoke]], there's [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|fire]]!"

*"Hey, [[you]]! Get off my cloud!"

*"SPOOOOOKY!"

*"Haha, here's the problem: [[ALL CAPS|TOO MANY TOASTERS]]."

*"[[Common knowledge|You know what they say]]. [[Wtf|All toasters toast toast]]!"

==Controversy and Criticism==

*Because YTPers or whatever the fuck they are called, converted these dumbassed cutscenes from QUEBECGAMERS.COM, the Hotel Mario clips on [[YouTube]] are banned because of copyrighted material. If someone used these clips in a YTP before it's too late, [[Sonic|that's no good!]]

==Youtube Poops==
