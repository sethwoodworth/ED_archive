Cosplayfucks
[[Image:Quistis.jpg|thumb|Cosplayfucks: TEH GOGGLES, THEY DO NOTHING.]]
{{ljcomm|user=Cosplayfucks}} was what would have happened if somebody decided to make a [[LiveJournal]] [[community]] based on the [[cosplay|hideous mutations]] that arose from Japan after the A-bomb.  Its creator is michichu, an awesomely creepy [[China|Cantonese]] [[lesbian]] [[Goth]].

Cosplayfuckers understand the value of [[drama| honest, genuine critique for bad cosplay]].

==Typical posts==

Cosplayfucks is a magnet for [[drama]] because the majority of posts/replies fall into the following categories:

* posts that make fun of [[cosplay|cosplayers]] for being [[ugly]] or [[fat]].
* the poster has an unrelated personal vendetta against a [[cosplay|cosplayer]], or a ''def_jam_vendetta:'' 
* ''is_this_loli:'' abuse of [[loli|underage]] [[cosplay|cosplayers]] for age-inappropriate costumes.
* ''you_posted_me:'' when another member of the community gets caught in bad cosplay. Also sometimes an attempt at fishing for compliments because their costume isn't that bad.
* ''i_posted_me:'' self-mock, often with acceptance that one sucks cocks.
* ''noobie_boobies:'' risque/revealing cosplay, images usually [[NSFW]].
* ''unrelated_fcuks:'' general retarded [[anime]]-related verbal ejaculations.

===Reactions===
As anime nerds are fragile, insecure people, and the cosplaying variety will spend hours [[Google|googling]] their names to see if anyone is lavishing them with attention for dressing up like a cartoon. Most of the drama manifests as guest [[comments]] when the cosplayer being fucked finds the post where they're being ripped on. [[Comments]] usually follow this example:

"LOL U DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE ARTISTIC DIRECTION I WAS GOING WITH THAT" and "LOL I M COMFORTABLE WITH MY BODY U [[Pro-ana|ANOREXIC FASCISTS]]!!!!!!!11"

Cosplayfucks is generally disliked by [[furry|furries]] because spiteful ridicule of [[fursuit|nerds in costume]] by [[Something Awful|more pretentious and arrogant nerds]] is bound to end in [[fursecution]].

===From [[LiveJournal]]=== 
Cosplayfucks was born in January 2005 to michichu and her dyke-of-the-week. This illegitimate child was kept a secret for a while until {{lj|user=onsan}}, a [[pedophile]] like michichu, came along to be a surrogate father. Cosplayfucks grew to be a strapping young man, enjoyed by approximately 1000 LJ users, with an average of 10-15 entries a day. 

On Thanksgiving of 2005, [[LJ Abuse]] decided to celebrate in the true American way by shutting down Cosplayfucks. The official reason cited by [[LJ Abuse]] was "harrassment." Other "back up" communities were brought up by other members, but most of them were shut down immediately by the LiveJournal abuse team. Michichu and {{lj|user=on_san}} were burned at the stake to set examples,  ensuring that the tragedy of Cosplayfucks would not happen ever again. Michichu resurrected as the grotesque {{lj|user=michichu2}}, but has been put on notice and is frequently policed by [[LJ Abuse]], who stalk her at animu cons.

Sometimes, dead is better.

===From [[JournalFen]]===
Several of the users attempted to get it hosted on [[JournalFen]], home of [[Fandom_Wank]]. Many members of Cosplayfucks on [[JournalFen]] were assassinated one by one before the community was bombed altogether. 

===Elsewhere===

The members of Cosplayfucks have tried many other forms of hosting, such as ProBoards, GreatestJournal and deliberately-misspelled versions ("{{ljcomm|user=cosplayfcuks}}") on [[LiveJournal]]. Of course, [[Al Gore]], a fairly famous cosplayer, has banned them at every turn.  Members gave up buying one package of MSG-filled ramen a week and donated their parents' money in hopes of registering [http://cosplayfucks.net/ Cosplayfucks.net]. This was successful, and Cosplayfucks has become a teeming cesspool of [[drama]] and [[lulz]]. Eventually, they would like to purchase hosting capable of running an LJ clone and copycat [[Fandom_Wank]]. While they're at it, they would also like ponies and blowjobs for Christmas.


A [[Wikipedia]] article was created about the community, but it was deleted within the hour.

The online forum community reached 1000 members AGAIN on March 23, 2006, only five months after its C-section birth.


It has been unanimously decided that the [[Internets]] hates Cosplayfucks.
