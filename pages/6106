Overclocked ReMix

[http://www.ocremix.org Overclocked ReMix] (aka OCRemix and OCR) is a website "dedicated to arranging video and computer game music. [Their] mission is to prove that this music is not disposable or merely background, but is as intricate, innovative, and lasting as any other form." It is one of the [[nerd|geekiest]] [[gay|sausagefests]] in the history of the internets, which is wholly analogous to being the most [[racist]] member of [[KKK|Klu Klux Klan]]. Here, twenty year old [[basement dwellers]] steal Fruityloops or [[Reason]] off of [[bittorrent]], find a Super Mario Bros. midi, and pass it off as their own work.

==Site History==
Back in 1999, known [[pedo]] David Lloyd (known as djpretzel) created OCR as a way to attract twelve year old boys back to his apartment. He stole a few midis, found what he could off of [[Kazaa]], and BOOM! Minor e-celebrity! As of this writing, OCR's [[forum]] alone has [http://www.ocremix.org/forums/memberlist.php nearly 18,000 members].
At some point in mid-2002, djpretzel forgot his pedofiliac roots and decided OCR was [[serious business]]. This led to a sheerly enormous amount of drama which spills over to this very day. Dozens of the most respected members of the community left to create their [http://www.vgmix.com own] [http://www.oneupstudios.com sites]. Ironically enough, this left Mr. Lloyd alone with none other than, yes, 7,000 13 year-old-boys.

==Judges==
Occurring roughly around the time as the Great Exodus, djpretzel decided to institute a "judge's panel". The sole purpose of the panel is to rip apart the works of prospective remixers sufficiently that they will never try submitting to the site again. The community thus remains a small, manageable size.

[[Noone]] has ever liked a judge, and it is [[common knowledge]] that anyone claiming otherwise is just a sycophant hoping to become a judge himself.

==List of Active Judges==

* [[Sweden|Another Soundscape]] - Possibly the [[gay|fruitiest]] judge to ever grace the panel. Writes about 20 shitty remixes per day and is [[Shit nobody cares about|the reason you can only submit a mix once every three weeks.]]
* Big giant circles - made a judge recently. [[Noone]] ever heard of him until then.
* CHz - [http://olremix.org/remixes/162 '''NNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!''']
* Darkesword - dirty [[Arab]] with an [[anime]] fetish. Also the worst [[mod]] in site history, well known for his habit of locking innocuous threads with no comment other than an eye-rolling emoticon. [[Image:Icon_rolleyes.gif]]
* Fishy - [[Emo]] [[britfag]]. Claims to be nineteen but is pretty obviously a [[13-year-old boy|twelve-year old]]. Is also an avid Arctic Monkeys fanboy.
* [[faggot|Hoboka]] - 14 yr old girl with attention neeeeeeeds
* Liontamer - biggest nerd on OCR. [[srsly]].
* Malcos - token black man
* Palpable - [[N00b|Who?]]
* Vigilante - [[hippy]]
* zircon - half his body weight is the sand in his vagina. Dwarfs pixietricks in this way much as a whale dwarfs a tadpole.
* zyko - [[white|YO DAWG I BE gANGSTA AN PLAY A MEAN GUITAR]]

==Drama==
If given the chance, every user will dispute every judges' decision ever made. To rub it in even more, djpretzel made every decision ever made a matter of [http://www.ocremix.org/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=12|public record]. To combat any semblance of fun, questioning whether a remix should have been posted is a bannable offense.

Xx PxFury xX: fuck you 
<br>JTnights (vigilante): i love you. 
<br>Xx PxFury xX: you're a shitty judge fag 
<br>JTnights: i love you 
<br>JTnights: hug me 
<br>JTnights: WHY WONT YOU LOVE ME!? 
<br>Xx PxFury xX: wow, what a fucking faggot 
<br>JTnights: i love you 
<br>JTnights: starblast says hi 
<br>Xx PxFury xX: fuck that fat fuck 
<br>JTnights: what an impressively large vocabulary you have! 
<br>JTnights: thats why i love yoU!

==Protricity==
Former judge and remixer, Protricity is a Jew. As a judge, he ripped on any mix he could get his hands on in beautiful, sardonic manner. Unfortunately, he made fun of djpretzel once so he was removed from the panel of judges. Since he once signed up for phpbbforfree, Protricity also thinks he's a [[1337]] h4x0rz. So far his mischief has included,

*[[Hacking]] [http://www.vgmix.com vgmix], forcing them to shut down the site altogether for one year and six months so far. (Confirmed)
*Hacking [http://www.oneupstudios.com oneup studios] and spamming everyone on the mailing list. (Confirmed)
*Posing as a [[n00b]] with stolen samples on the works in progress board. (Denied)
*Gaining [[OP]]s on one of OCR's [[IRC]] channel and [http://wiki.unmod.org/index.php?title=VGDJ_Pwnt banning everyone there.] He is still dodging the g-line bans sent his way through Enterthegame's administration. (Confirmed)
*Making threatening phone calls to [[Attention Whore|pixietricks]] (Denied: She actually made threatening calls to me if you'd believe it)
*Blanking the OCR [[Wikipedia]] page. (Denied)
*Periodically flooding the forums with thread-breaking animated gif posts. (Denied)
*Hacked the Doom Petition into a different dimension of pwnt. (Confirmed)
*Last but not least, "fag" is apparently the most insulting word ever. (Confirmed)

Keep in mind that he's kept this up for a solid two years, now. There's a difference between trolling for the [[lulz]] and doing so because you have no friends.

==OCR Welcomes [[ED]] Article with [[Asking for it|Open Arms!]]==

"That is possibly the worst thing I've [[Evar|EVER]] seen. I don't care how funny anyone thinks that is. That's pretty insulting to me. [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|In my own opinion]] that site should have that page removed, or the site should be shut down.

I don't care how funny they think it is, it's NOT. [[Caps_lock|ABSOLUTELY NOT!]]

Making fun of people, making fun of OCR, the judges, and the shenanigans of the past. Honestly, let sleeping dogs lie, and get over it already. There's enjoy negativity out there, I don't believe we asked for, or deserve more here.

If it was something a bit nicer, maybe even actually joking, I wouldn't be taking the time to write this post. However, the way I see it, it's scathing, ill-humored BS that I honestly cannot stand for." [[Retard|~Dyne]]

==Unmod==
[[Image:Ocr-dicks.gif|thumb|The mods on this site probably all have [[Asperger's]].]]
[[image:Pixietricks-fanfic.png|thumb|A fairly accurate allegory.]]

[[At least 100|Thousands and thousands of years ago]], djpretzel created an unmoderated forum so he could create an alt account and start a [[loli]] thread without raising any eyebrows. The move backfired, however, when a [[Scientology|few good men]], starring John Travolta and Jack Nicholson, started posting half decent threads, spamming the bad ones with [[goatse]], and pointing out the plot holes in a certain judge’s enormous nose. After a few years of this nonsense, [[camwhore|djpretzel outright deleted the forum because someone took pictures of him at a public event or some other manufactured crap.]] He replaced it with Offtopic, which is exactly the same thing only you have to carefully mask yourself when spamming it. That isn’t exactly hard since the site staff is comprised of [[moron]]s obsessing over video game music.


===Sidebar Shenanigans===

According to those who have not left their computer in the last two years, the creation of the [http://wiki.unmod.org/index.php?title=Sidebar_Shenanigans sidebar] is more important historically than [[9/11]]. All the pissing and moaning ever boiled down to was 26 unmodders shrilly screaming [[XBox|“SIDEBAR IS HUEG LIKE XBOX”]] followed by them getting banned. Lots of people called it [[fascist]] since getting banned from a private site for acting stupid is entirely comparable to the [[Holocaust]], but none of that ever really mattered since every single one of them just began to post from their alt accounts five minutes after posting in the satellite sites they were [[suicide|quitting ocr forever]] and most hopped the boat to UnMod.org where they found the foul stench of tyranny and returned to OCR just in time for their fair hero djpretzel to delete the forum entirely, resulting in [[epic]] [[pwnt]]  The important thing to remember is the sidebar, as with most things, was just a delicious pretext for the [[lulz]] and [[drama]] internet people live off of during winter. 

===Remaining Sub-Forums===
====Offtopic====

The slowest satellite of the community. While some struggled to keep it alive early on in the game, those brave [[an hero|heroes]] soon departed for the fair shores of mental retardation over at Remod leaving only the cream of the Atomic-Dog-ass-kissing crop, such as [[Butts|sycophant]] teh existentialist. As a result, it never evolved from the fourteen year olds from general discussion wandering in and posting unfunny [[YouTube]] videos. Its only purpose today is to serve as a vent for such radical ideas as "NO ONE POSTS ANYTHING INTERESTING HERE ANYMORE" and "WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO".

====Politics, Philosophy, and Religion====

While never considered Unmod [[canon]] and in fact as close to an anti-unmod as possible, PPR is a good place for [[idiots]] on a video game website to debate politics with other idiots on a video game website.  As such, it did serve as a wellspring of humor for everyone else.  Some of the features that show the whole thing is made of [[win]] are the prolific bands of [[uber]]-[[Christians]] who respond to every single post with "CUZ GOD SEZ SO!!1  ITS IN TEH BIBLE AND [[Pat_Robertson|PAT ROBERTSON]] IS MY DAD!!"  Then the [[atheists]] come in and are like "UH HUH, GOD ISANT REEL..." There are also economic debates that amount to internet [[Karl Marx]] debating internet [[Ayn Rand]].  Suffice to say, no one of quality would click the link to this subforum.

===Splinter Sites and "successors" to Unmod===
====[[unfunny|OLR]]====

The original refuse overflow for UnMod, Overlooked Remix was created by Richter, a [[/b/tard]] with a simple dream: to give birth to the absolute most god-awful music ever created by human hands. In mid-2004, there was a hilarious backlash against [[spam|postwhores]] and many of the members of the OCR Postwhore Society made the exodus to OLR where they proceeded to settle in and become the only users of the site.  Richter hated his new-found friends and banned a few of them.  The community eventually languished or maybe just normal people stopped remembering it was there. OLR peeked around [[2004]] and since then who fucking knows if it even still exists (don't bother checking).

====gerbilfat====
In ancient times, Unmod's unsurprisingly massive [[furry]] community decided there were too many kids in unmod for sophisticated dialogue such as their [[yiffing]] or that, more accurately, there was not nearly enough [[emo]] [[drama]] to properly sustain a full-grown fur.  And thus gerbilfat was born.  Yes, it still exists; No, [[noone]] knows why.

====Unmod.org====

.org was created by a few of the core members of Unmod's secret [[cabal]] when they realized that OCRemix's forum sucks and that DJP is a [[tool]] who can't tolerate differences in opinion. The new site was a [[Big Brother|garden of free expression]] with only one rule: follow the Party line.  Internal politicking and confusion about exactly who speaks for the cabinet keeps members on their toes.  The [[Internet Law|2005 Anti-Wackiness Proposition]] declared all behavior that can be described as "[[Scientology|wacky]]", "[[Wikipedia|zany]]" or "[[1d20|random]]" [[Faggotry|morally offensive]]; a number of [[Noobs|immigrants]] that came in the waves following various reprehensible acts of OCR's administration [[unfunny|fell afoul of this rule]] and were mocked slightly as a result.  This apparently being [[butthurt|too much to bear]], they left, and went on to create their own forums, where they spend all day [[gay|happily]] posting random catchphrases and stupid [[Flash]] videos. Unmod.org is home to Flankingline, a disgusting [[faggot]] who has a [[lion|lion king]] [[fetish]]. Occasionally,  he posts a new Simba [[fanfic]] involving him raping another [[Disney]] character. [[Some argue]] that this was once a joke, but the buckets of [[semen ]] jerked off as a result of reading said fanfics suggests otherwise.

====Remod====

Spinoff to Inadequate Cheese Fondlers Club or something else no one cares about, Remod is where the [[animu]] obsessed 17 year olds ended up. In addition to posting strange, [[unfunny|inscrutable]] humor that no one ever really laughs at, there is also mounds upon mounds of low-quality [[fanart]] and ridiculously [[unfunny|zany]] [[webcomic|webcomics]] about girls and maybe a giraffe and hey they're on the moon I'm a genius.  It is believed Remod has the most users of all the successor states but it is tempered by the fact [[noone]] can tell them apart.

===Notable People Still Hanging Around Offtopic/OCR===

'''[[internet tough guy|Atomic Dog]]'''

Egocentric wannabe [[libertarian]] with insecurity issues. To make up for his baby sized [[penis]], he regularly posts [[LJ]]-esque rants, ok-cupid quizzes, and [[lies|bragging about his fast lane life in Los Vegas]] when in reality all he has to offer is sitting at his [[computer]] and posting LJ-esque rants and ok-cupid quizzes in A FORUM ABOUT VIDEO GAME MUSIC. 

Greatly enjoys [[Superman]] because he is a closeted [[homosexual]] who has the need to be dominated.

'''Radical Dreamer'''

[[Bisexual]] [[pedophile]] [[rapist]] whose massive libido and promiscuity is caused by the fact that he was molested as a [[child]]. May have also caused a post count of 30,000. His passage here is the only part of this article to be literally true. 

'''Arek'''

[[internet disease|"Hey guys I’m really sick I only have a month to live :("

"That sucks dude good luck"

"Yeah these are my last days"

"Feel better"

"The doctor’s got a new heart today I might make it a little longer"

"Why won’t you just die already"]]

===Non-Notable Personalities Who Added Themselves as a Desperate Cry for Attention===
'''PassivePretentiousness'''
*Does not seem to understand the meaning of the word pretentious.
[[Basement dweller]] who splits his time between [[lying|arguing politics]], attempting to [[forced meme|force memes]] in offtopic (a forum anthropologists estimate has about 3 users) and lashing out at invisible internet enemies. He is nothing more than a fag that should stop breathing and save the air for those that matter but believes this is all very "ironic" (another word he throws around and doesn't seem to quite get) and that everyone is in fact enamored with his charm and wit. He also can't write a funny article for shit, except for [http://wiki.unmod.org/index.php?title=Teh_Existentialist#Selected_Bibliography all dis shit].  Is [[emo]].
*Always posting about his social ineptitude and his lone drinking, which is obviously a cry for help: "hay guys i am durnk is this awesome y/n ?"
*HE'S FUCKING BALD HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

'''DrumUltimA'''
*Entire existence is a desperate cry for attention. is also [[Unwarranted self-importance|better than you]] because he attends the '''PEABODY CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC''' and wastes no opportunity to remind everyone around him of this fact.

'''chtonic'''
*14 year old ska homosexual gay faggot who likes Le Cock and brags about doing hard drugs because he's cool like that. Used to sign "--chth" at the end of his post to marginalize himself from the lesbian [[otherkin]] who likes his copypasta music.

'''neminem'''
*Nobody. Been around UnMod since what, these days, could be considered reasonably close to the beginning, and, as such, refuses to leave, despite knowing full-well that there's nothing much there anymore. Also, mashup mashup mashup. Mashup? Mashup. P.S. Nethack Firefly mashup. Also, you just lost [[The Game]].

'''Atmuh'''
*An idiot that doesn't get the message that no one wants him around. Enjoys ◕◡◕.

'''Tensei'''
*Eurofag extraordinaire. Prides himself in going on attentionseeking, wannabee-trollish 'rants' about [[Shit nobody cares about|subjects as diverse as JRPGs, Final Fantasy, Golden Sun and Chiptunes]]. Shamelessly rips quotes from bash.org and ED in his eternal quest for validation from people on the [[internets]]. [[moot|He also wishes to be the little girl]], but will vehemently deny this when questioned.

==Nice Work!==

A [[old meme|three year old meme]] everyone loves because they do not leave the forums.  Lately people have started shutting up about it.
