F40PH
__NOTOC__
[[Image:F40.jpg|thumb|[[OMFG]]!]]

'''F40PH''' Is <s>quite possibly</s> without a doubt one of the single greatest achievements of [[science|modern science]] and is the most [[awesome]] thing ever. It is often used as a counter to the [[furry]] menace on Fridays, which have now become F40PHriday. The General Motors Electro-Motive Division model F40PH is a [[Pwnage|(1.21 GW)]] [[b|B-B]] diesel-electric locomotive with [[Over 9000|3000]] horsepower intended to scare children and carry out its service on [[4chan|Amtrak's]] [[fursecution|intercity]] lines. [[300|400]] F40's were built from 1976 onwards, built in [[Canadia#London|London, Canadia]]. It runs on [[Vespene gas]] and mulched [[fursuits]].

===F40PH Facts===
*It's a Locomotive, not a train.
*The F40PH is superior to every single locomotive and train in the world. Steam? A Streamliner engine stands no chance. Diesel power? The Dash-9 stands no chance. High speed rail? The ICE, Acela, Shinkansen and not even the TGV stand a chance. 
*Most Chuck Norris "facts" are instead about F40PH.
*If you own an F40PH, you never lose the game.
*F40PH wins the game, not its owner.
*The F40PH is the enraged and vengeful spirit of Bruce Lee.

===Crusade Against Furries===
In an effort to [[kill it with fire|combat]] [[furry|furfags]] on the many [[chan]]s of the Internet, the F40PH is one of many vital tools that should be used. The best way to do this is to flood any Furry Friday thread with a [[XChan_Directory_Dumper|directory dumper]] of some sort, alongside the obligatory [[Fursecution|YIFF IN HELL]] battlecry. Furfags, as well as [[closet furry|moralfag /b/tards]], will take this seriously and will engage in [[nerd|epic]] flamewars.<br/>
Eradication methods are never without their setbacks, however. Posting the F40PH on [http://www.fchan.us Fchan] (even just posting F40PH in the text field) will result in an immediate [[ban]]; it is suggested you use as many [[sockpuppet]]s as possible while [[sage|fighting]] the good fight.
