[[Image:Aegion2.jpg|thumb|right|{{lj|user=aegion}} has a very high opinion of herself.]]Created on December 29, 2006, the [[LiveJournal]] user {{lj|user=aegion}} became an instant [[drama whore]] and suspected [[troll]]. 

She hates people who live on drama farms, preferring to inhabit [http://community.livejournal.com/crochet/ more urban drama regions] instead.

Due to the constant featuring of Aegion's stupids in the community '''[[Stupid free|stupid_free]]''', she swore to take on the task of banning all communities based on making fun of others.  She created the community  {{lj|user=ban_dramafarms}} in an attempt to rally others that have been made fun of, but within 24 hours, had deleted said community. 

Aegion rants about people doing [[drugs]] and really enjoys handbags and [[God]] wank. She can easily be spotted by use of her trademark phrase [http://community.livejournal.com/girl_gamers/3001163.html?thread=38902859 "I WILL PWN YOU ALL"].

=The drama farm massacre=
On August 10, 2007, Aegion announced that she planned to have all "drama farms" removed from LiveJournal for harassment. The original statement was later deleted, but [http://sayonara-snot.livejournal.com/20976.html?thread=252656#t252656 the conversation continued] in {{lj|user=sayonara_snot}}'s journal. 

In that conversation, she stated her cause to have all communities similar to '''[[Stupid free|stupid_free]]''' banned from LiveJournal for harassment, and have the site's Terms of Service rewritten to reflect this rule. She referred to [[Jameth]] in an attempt to add legitimacy to some of her strange claims, and asked him to [http://sayonara-snot.livejournal.com/20976.html?thread=295408#t295408 "be like a sort of mascot for (her) cause"] although he has stated for the record that he was [http://sayonara-snot.livejournal.com/20976.html?thread=306672#t306672 far too drunk at the time to deal with the situation]. 

Hypocrisy is rampant due to the fact that, as a rule, [[Stupid free|stupid_free]] does not go into personal journals to harass the users, yet Aegion has ventured into both {{lj|user=sayonara_snot}}'s journal and {{lj|user=syn_abounds}}'s journal.

When {{lj|user=syn_abounds}} attempted to join (and was temporarily allowed into) {{lj|user=ban_dramafarms}}, Aegion left [http://syn-abounds.livejournal.com/101639.html?thread=293383#t293383 a comment] stating:

<blockquote>Nice try but as you've noticed I already removed your membership. :(<br><br>

Tell sayonara_snot that her little community is going down. In a few months she'll be saying "sayonara" to her moderation. Haha.<br><br>

Byah! <--- see this, this is my [[Howard Dean]] impression.<br>
Byah!!!</blockquote>

= ban_dramafarms =
{{lj|user=ban_dramafarms}} was created on August 10, 2007. The community information page was a major [[tl;dr]] essay, claiming to be focused on the takedown of "drama farms" and helping victims regain self esteem.

Snippets from the late community info page include:

<blockquote>
This community is a safe space for victims of drama farms and anyone else who believes drama farms should be disallowed on Livejournal. This community is for you to vent about your bad experience with a drama farm and every so often we will have guest posters and experts on the subject of online mobbing and cyberbullying. This community is also meant to create an organized campaign to get rid of drama farms on livejournal.<br><br>
'''Does Livejournal allow drama farms? What are some drama farms on Livejournal?'''<br>
Unfortunately, as of right now drama farms are allowed. However this could soon change. One of the purposes of this community is to convince Livejournal and [[Six Apart]] to disallow drama farms, as they fall under the definition of "[[harassment]]" which is stated as being against the Livejournal Terms of Service. We believe the best way to persuade them to get rid of the drama farm communities is through an organized email campaign to [[LJabuse]] and even the CEOs of Six Apart combined with refusal to buy or renew our [[LiveJournal caste system|paid accounts]] until they disallow this kind of organized harassment.<br><br>
An example of a drama farm on Livejournal is {{lj|user=stupid_free}}.<br><br>
'''How does a drama farm effect it's victims?'''<br>
The victim of a drama farm usually becomes afraid to post in public communities because often the drama farm will stalk a victim and make multiply posts about them whenever they are spotted somewhere. The members of drama farms get [[Lulz|enjoyment]] out of this knowledge and derive a sense of power from it. In an effort to intimidate victims into hiding they frequently tell them things like "I would be ashamed to get on livejournal anymore if I were you", "you're a complete fool, everyone is laughing at you", etc. Some people, especially younger victims, suffer [[Suicide|a significant drop in self esteem]] from an encounter with a drama farm, thinking that since so many people are ganging up on them there most be something wrong with them. In reality, the drama farm is doing it to tons of people and there is nothing "wrong" with the victim nor are they to blame.<br><br>
