OiNK
==Massive Drama==

on 18th of November, 2007, OINK, being a happy pig that he is, registered on a super sikrit torrent tracker, whose url he previously posted on his forums, which is totally against their rules. Naturally, he gets [[b&]], comes to [[IRC]] to [[butthurt|demand an explanation]], when the other users on the channel noticed he was running his irc client as [[root]] ([[lol|Noob]]) he was then banned from [[IRC]] too.
As if it wasn't enough [[lulz]] for today, a random user posted a screenshot of OiNK's disabled profile to waffles.fm, the l33t users of the sikrit site got the random user's ip address then he was [[b&]] on the sikrit site. Fail[[trolls]] at [[Waffles.fm]], Oink's replacement, got massive [[butthurt]] because of their visionary finally getting what he was [[asking for it|asking for]]. At the moment of writing the drama still escalates.

==About==
[[Image:Sabirae.jpg|thumb|When music sharing goes terribly terribly wrong.]]
'''Oink's Pink Palace''', or simply '''Oink''' was a super secret [[UK]] based gated community, where all the [[indie|stupid music]] [[UK|snobs]] hung out to download pirated albums and talk about how their taste in music is superior to everybody else's. It was pretty much like [[Napster]] with forums, except without all of the [[DMCA | DMCAs]]. It also had a fair amount of [[software]], [[book|audio books]] and [[comics]] [[torrent]]s but despite promises of pink [[pussy]] found in the name, Oink was not for porn.

Oink also had no movie [[torrent]]s, no TV [[torrent]]s and has a shit load of [[Nazi|rules]] dictating everything from what [[P2P]] [[client]] you can use, what you could and couldn't upload and keeping it [[1337|'members only']].

==PARTY V&==
On October 23, 2007, Oink got [[v&]] by the [[England | limeys]] and [[fags | Dutch]]. Their manager, who was [[at least 100 years ago|at least 100 years old]], got arrested for selling [[CP]], pirating [[porn | records]], and being a [[nigra|gangstar]]. Nobody noticed. Ex mods are still [[butthurt|RAGED]] about oinks demise. Speaking of the mods at Oonk, 99.98% of these power hungry assholes somehow defied basic physics and became greater elitist faggots than Apple users. They generally made the forums a haven for other elitist member who were dumber and generally more un-funny than Dane Cook. They proceeded to ban anyone who slightly questioned their fucking retarded decisions and ideas, making Oink progressively shittier. Unfortunately many of these fuckers still have positions of power at the wannabe Oink sites Waffles and What. An effort is currently in place to give their info to the RIAA so they will hopefully kill themselves when they have their website taken away. 

The fact is, websites like [[The Pirate Bay]] do this for free, so it falls into a legal and moral grey area. OiNK was doing it for money, which is a crime, [[Fact|pure and simple]].

==Mascot==
The mascot of Oink is a [[kawaii|cute]] little pig, hence the name. What pigs have to do with file sharing is still a mystery, and many scientists are hard at work right now working on this dilemma. One popular theory is that in order to attract [[16 year old girls]], a cute mascot was a must.
[[Image:Oink_logo.gif|thumb|A cute mascot is a must.]]
[[Image:Oink.gif|thumb|The only cool part of Oink is where the pig gets [[old meme | set up the bomb]].]]
This attitude is reflected in the policy of "A Cute Avatar Is A Must", which states that in order to have any sort of icon, it has to be some cute [[furry | stuffed animal]] nonsense or else you'll get banned.

==Forums==
Oink also plays host to its own [[forum | forums]] which consist mainly of [[noobs]] begging for a cute icon so that they don't get banned. [[Zeriara]] heard about this, and formulated a secret plan:
<ol>
<li>Get commissions for cute icons
<li>Don't draw anything
<li>[[????]]
<li>[[Profit!]]
</ol>
Unfortunately, nobody would give her an invite, so she got [[pwnd]].
Everybody on the forums also has a [[last.fm]], and they use their signatures to brag about their really really really [[shitty | good]] taste in music. They do this by [[Copypasta | copy-pasting]] charts from their last.fm pages into their signatures, so that the whole world will always know what they're listening to.

The forums will often contain epic gems like people claiming that [[timecube|0.120 > 0.12]] and [[iTunes]] is a proper player.

The other highlight of the forums is a [http://oink.me.uk/forums.php?action=viewtopic&topicid=16425 really long thread] that tries to rip off [[Bash.org]], by assembling the [[At least 100 years ago | world's longest]] list of bad [[IRC]] quotes. Some of the [[unfunny | funniest]] gems include such priceless humor as:
<pre><Cirwen> lol msn on the phone would be funny
<Adz> its availiable
<feetonfedora> i wonder how long it is going to be before i have a toaster with built in msn</pre>
LOL SKYPE

And who could forget the "It's [[unfunny | funny]] because it's true" classic:
<pre>[00:02] <BaBy> »» WinAmp :: Higher :: Creed :: Greatest Hits :: 01:47 / 05:26 :: (6/25) :: 224 kbps ««
[00:03] <P10> nooo
[00:03] <P10> Not Creed
[00:03] <P10> Even God hates Creed.</pre>
Oh man, what a knee-slapper!

==Invites==
Jumping on the bandwagon of [[GMail]], the creators of Oink tried to create hype by making it an invitation-only system. Unfortunately, the [[stupid]] [[fuck | fucks]] neglected to exploit the even bigger market of invitation sales, instead deciding to ban them altogether. The logic was that by banning the sale of invites, they made sure that only really [[goth | indie]] [[fag | hipsters]] were allowed on the site, thus boosting their prestige. [[At least 100 | At least 98]] people have bought into this bullshit, as evidenced by Oink's page on [http://43things.com 43Things]:

Despite these restrictions, you can still find occasional auctions on [[eBay]] (more like e-GAY lol) hawking invites to Oink. However, once one becomes a Power User+++, one receives so many invites that they soon become about as valuable as the [[Japan | yen]].

==Ratio==
You will often hear [[fag | Oink users]] talking about their 'ratio' (often referred to as 'ration' by [[extreme]] [[retard]]s), which is a simple proportion of the amount of [[music | erotic porn]] uploaded to the amount downloaded. Once you upload 10 gigs of [[porn]], obtain a ratio greater than 1.00, and have been a member for moar than 2 weeks, you become what is known as a '''Power User+''', which is how the [[RIAA]] knows that you are a real [[h4x0r | pirate]] and that all DMCAs should be sent to [[you]]. In return for becoming a Power User+++, you get access to a special forum ("Because you're special and we love you!" -oink.me.uk) that contains secret threads such as "Growing a beard..." and "why is it so god damn hard to watch a video file". OH MY!

==Unfunny==
[[Image:Oink is a troll.jpg|thumb|right|oink is a troll, and [[lolcow|he will milk you for all lol you can give]].]]
Oink is generally considered to be unfunny, as anything [[funny]] that is detected by the forum moderators is quickly deleted, and the offender [[banned]]. There are a lot of things you can get banned for on Oink, and the following list is by no means exclusive:
*Being funny
*Using naughty language on the forums
*Thinking or breathing
*Not knowing the rules, even though you can't read the rules unless you have an invite
*Not having a cute icon (it is a must!)
*Giving [[moar]] [[desu]] to those who ask
*Uploading any torrents that aren't at 192 kbps or better, because everybody on Oink is an [[audiophile]], [[amirite]]?
*Selling invites for profit
*Selling invites for [[AIDS | charity]]
*Being black person
*Inviting anybody who breaks the rules. The theory is that by making sure that the indie hipsters only invite moar indie hipsters, the [[black people]] will be cock-blocked
*Downloading music without uploading your social security details and hidden [[furry]] stash
*Mentioning the fact that "Icky Thump" by the White Stripes was removed by the [[RIAA]].
*[[CP]]
*Being a [[user]] when the site was taken down.
