It has been said that the internet requires no test to enter it.  What this means is that most of the people you run into via web pages, chat, or email will be dumber than a sack full of soggy and cold White Castles, and they will be about as stimulating.  Because of this very fact, many people may find themselves unable to formulate ideas into an article.  This '''Generic Article''' is here to help users who are not bright, or, because of some genetic defect, believe that there is only one very limited form of humor:  that of a 12 year old boy.

==Example and Summation==
[[Image:Generic - funny-picture.png|thumb|A final, parting shot picture is always nice.]]
This is your introduction/informational section and could (possibly) go something like this:

<font color="blue">'''[SUBJECT]''' is a '''slut''' who '''acts butthurt''' on '''LiveJournal'''.  She caused '''massive fail''' while '''mincing''' with '''a large online community'''. But '''only furries''' really '''saw it happen''' because '''paying customers''' knew that '''The Holy Bible''' was '''banning fools and noobs alike'''.</font>

By copying and pasting or repeating these sentences several times, and by adding numerous adjectives, you should have a well fleshed-out article within minutes. 

Don't forget to pipe the following popular catchphrases into your article with rash abandon:

*[[Faggotry]]
*[[Cock]]
*[[Shit nobody cares about]]
*[[You]]
*[[White Knight]]
*[[Pedophile]]
*[[Emo]]

You may wish to break up these sentences with images, tables, quotes, galleries, or embedded video, but since those things are rather complicated, it is probably not a good idea, and really isn't necessary because you probably didn't even make headers and sub-headers within the body of your text anyways.  

And since you are only writing one silly little attack article about a moderator that banned you at some shitty, insignificant Nintendo forum, you probably will never return to Encyclopedia Dramatica anyways.

==Don't Bother Looking At Any Of These==

Links to Context or facts are really a stupid idea.  Nobody checks any of that stuff.

* [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Basic Rules]] - This page should be your first stop before you do anything on this site.  

* [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:About]] - A general idea of what is going on.

* [[Help:Contents]] - Everything you really need to know.

* [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Templates/All]] - Some things to work with.

* [[Sandbox]] - A thing to work in.

* [[Categories]] - Narrow down your subject.

* [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Collapsing Objects]] - Help streamline your page.

* [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Morphing Objects]] - Further streamlining.

* [[HTML]] - A good working knowledge of HTML is a great help.

*[[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Formatting]] - the funky shit.

* [[The Comprehensive Guide To Life]]

* [[User Stress Syndrome]]

==Stuff You Won't Use==

Don't bother adding a [[Special:Categories|Category]] or a [[Template:Series|Series]] to your article; nobody cares about that stuff anyway.
