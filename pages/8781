Very proud to be an asian
{{crap}}

[[image:Hailharuhi2vg3.jpg|thumb|If you don't salute with Haruhi you are a jealous, fatty American who dreams that they were Asian.]]
'''Very Proud to Be Asian''', AKA Khairun Min Akbar, or ProudAsianFaggot, is an [[basement-dweller|old man]]and [[shit|Indonesian]] douche. Who spends his life on the internet, spreading [[Engrish|THE GREAT PRIDE OF ASIANS BODY FORM]]. He supports his [[shitstorm|crusade]] with the amazing [[batshit|rationale]] that [[Americans]] [[fail]] at [[cosplay]]ing as [[animu]] characters because they don't look [[chink|Asian.]] What he conveniently forgot was that almost all [[animu]] characters have eyes the size of dinner plates while an average Chink's eyes are only slightly larger than the [[virgin|chances of him ever getting laid.]]

[[Shit nobody cares about|Cosplay in general sucks,]] but ProudAsianFaggot insists that [[chinks|Asians]] should be the [[THE BEST|only ones]] able to cosplay anything out of Anime.  

==The Azn Führer or The Confused Indonesian Nigger?==
[[image:Asian-Cosplayer-Iori-Yoshizuki-From-Is.jpg|thumb|left|ProudAsianFaggot [[bullshit|believes]] that this is what a [[16-year-old-girl|woman]] should look like. If her eyes so happen to squint not only is she [[wtf|NOT asian]] but she is also a [[American|"westerner."]] ]]
ProudAsianFaggot is a black person with [[bullshit|beliefs]]. He believes that Asians are [[Nazi|the pure race]] and should be the only ones allowed to cosplay. This is indeed the [[wapanese|truth]] considering the only good things [[america|westerners]] have accomplished is the [[fat|ability to consume 90 cheeseburgers a minute]] and [[4chan]].

He loves making [[wtf|irrelevant]] videos that either [[baw|whine and bitch]] about westerners, or talk about how [[kawaii|cute]] [[jailbait|17 year old Japanese girls are.]] He has the [[lie|correct]] point of view though, considering everyone fucking [[World War II|loves the Japanese.]]
    
ProudAsianFaggot, like any other cosplaying faggot, has a profile on Cosplay.com [http://www.cosplay.com/member/103461 Cosplay.com profile]. It reveals that he is black person but he continues to post about how great [[Japan]] is, despite the fact that the black person and any other Asian who was not Japanese were like the [[Jews|unwanted people]] to the Japanese when they decided they were going to [[ctrl alt del|take over the world]]. It is doubtful that he is even Indonesian and he is most likely just an [[wapanese|American dreamer who wishes he was Asian.]] ProudAsianFaggot is very hard to [[troll|confront]] in some cases because he has  [[Jewtube|Youtube]] comments set to [[anti-lulz|pending approval.]] 


There are, however, several other warning signs to look for to ascertain that the [[faggot|man]] you are dealing with is, in fact, ProudAsianFaggot besides his username. First, and foremost, is his signature. His signature may or may not include him claiming that he is a ProudAsianFaggot but it will almost always include [[emoticon|v^___^v]] or some other [[batshit|awkward]] way of reciting [[desu|Japanese greetings.]]

==FACTS==

*ProudAsianFaggot will almost always have a [[sock puppet|fake]] account where he pretends to be a [[16-year-old-girl|a little Japanese girl.]]
*ProudAsianFaggot is [[sex|interested]] in [[pedobear|young females]] from the [[Aryan|Asian]] race.
*When [[some argue|he doesn't agree with you,]] he will state a couple of [[lies|facts]] to get you to believe that America should have [[baw|sympathy]] over [[LOL|what happened to Japan over decades ago.]] 
*ProudAsianFaggot is [[ugly|facially challenged.]]

==BIOGRAPHY==

Recently our ProudAsianFaggot [[came]] across a [[No girls on the internet|girl]] named TenshiAkina via [[Jewtube|Youtube.]]
[[Shit nobody cares about|Nobody is really interested in what happened afterwards.]] All we [[fact|know]] is that [[lulz]] ensued and ProudAsianFaggot ended up [[lurking|stalking]] TenshiAkina. Some other [[Weeaboo|Japanese]] monikers on [[Jewtube|Youtube]] were included, but again [[shit nobody cares about|it is too important]] to speak of because of the [[serious business|intensity of the subject at hand.]]

[[image:Uglyproudaisan.jpg‎|thumb|Proud Azn Fag attempts to cosplay even though he is balding. Also to note: [[Ugly|He looks absolutely NOTHING like the person he's cosplaying as.]]]]

Anyone who attempts to argue with the Führer will be jailed in one of his many [[Gaiafag|troll prisons.]]

Proud Asian Guy is now on YouTube and coming soon to a theater near you!  He has officially [[wapanese|declared himself to be Japanese,]] but he's not fooling anyone, because everyone on the [[internets|Internet]] knows that he's just a [[shit|mud]]-slinging black person [[faggot]] [[Bukkake|who takes it to the face]].  He even [[fail|learned how to speak Japanese!]]

|no i do not base my opinion on appearance, i go by the fact that if you read the artyst character information, they will state their character's nationality. solomon was german and jewish

father abel was italian

mello's name was mihail which is european

and all of the characters in Chevarlier de eon are based off of historic french people that actually existed.|Shichiyou-Koe digs up the hole of stupidity for Proud Azn Fag.
|You still don't get it DO YOU? Anyone can say this and that character are from this or that country or but not the character appearance. Or just say even an Asian go to outside of Asia, peoples still know he/she is an Asian even he/she change his nationality. Or here a more simple logic for you, a non Asian using Asian peoples as thier movie actor/actress to play as a non Asian hero or character. Will you call those Asian peoples non Asian or Asian? I'm sure you will call them as Asian even they play as a non Asian characters.|Proud Azn Fag learns how to dig his own holes all by himself so that people don't have to do it for him.

It is not like the old cosplay.com website option where there are country flags liested on the main website.|Proud Azn Fag attempts to find more lovely Azn girlfriends through Cosplay.com
|You already created a thread asking for such an option, only it was deleted (by myself) because you asked to see if you could filter out good costumes and not-so-good costumes by country, which people have reported to me about because they're upset about your choice of words. So even though you didn't include those words in this thread, you're probably not going to get your wish to try and filter out costumes by country. Sorry, but no..|Eurobeat King tells him that this isn't eHarmony.com for [[fangirls]] and [[fanboys]].
