Created [[at least 100 years ago]] by [[Drama]] Enthusiast [[Glenn Beck]] and his [[Furry|white-tailed Deer]] hunting [[Faggot]] sidekick [[White trash|Ted Nugent]], '''The Tea Party Movement''', or '''Tea Baggers''', as [[Democrats|Communists]] like to call them, are a bunch of [[Retarded|brain damaged]] [[Republican|Republicunts]] who are pissed off because they got [[Butthurt|pwned]] by a [[Barack Obama|Nigger]]. The movement is mostly made up of [[Christfags]] who want to take us back to [[Before the internet|1776]], restore [[Bullshit|honor]], bring back Slavery, find [[Jesus|Jebus]], [[ban]] [[Evolution|Evilution]], respect [[Christians|all human life]], deny the poor of affordable Healthcare Insurance, (Government Healthcare goes against the [[Bible]], because God made them poor to suffer) and will lead this country down the same path as [[Nazi]] [[Germany]] and Stalinism.

The Tea Party Movement is the official militant wing of [[Faux News|Fox News]]. Like modern street [[Gangs]], the upper crust of the organization claims to abide by the law, while covertly convincing their paranoid followers to commit violent acts of [[Drama]]. 

==History==

Although it has antecedents in the [[Ron Paul|Ron Paul Revolution™]], the John Birch Society v2.0 was founded when it became increasingly apparent that [[John McCain]] was a senile old man who ran his campaign into the ground by picking Sarah Palin as his Vice-President and had about a snowball's chance in hell of becoming president with her on the ballot. 

Their rioting has recently picked up steam (as well as news coverage) due to Fox News' obsessive reporting of the riots.  The odds of anything constructive coming out of 200 southerners screaming about not giving tax cuts for people who can't afford food doing anything are still being debated.

Despite all of their talk about "TAKIN' BACK THE COUNTRY!", the Tea Party was in [[fact]] [[fail|directly responsible for the republicans being unable to topple at least two democrat seats in the 2010 midterms election]].

==Strategies and Tactics==
[[Image:one big awful mistake america.jpg||thumb|right|200px|Acrostic poems are a useful tool often used to convince governments you are [[stupid|right]].]]
* [[Terrorist|McVeigh]] the fuck out of your government. 
* Openly carry a gun and then call the police "tyrants" for eying you with suspicion.
* Protest tax increases while collecting social security disability for being too [[fat]].
* Call anti-war protesters "terrorists" and "traitors", but threaten secession and civil war over a non-existent tax increase.
** Claim secession is a constitutional right granted to states to combat tyrannical central government.
*** Ignore the civil war.
* Support buying a ton of F-22 Raptors (Approx. $143 million per unit) to be used against brown people armed primarily with Soviet-era small arms.
* Worry about the PATRIOT Act ONLY after a [[Communist|black democrat]] became president.
* Get [[butthurt]] whenever someone calls the [[United States]] a democracy, but when Congress passes a bill to give money to [[Spics|Mexicans]] start an [[internet petition]] to override it.
* [[DAMN NIGGA]] [[Not racist|without being racist.]]
* Blank sections of [[ED]] without being vandals.
* [[Stupid|Misspell]] [[Idiot|protest]] [[Retard|signs]].  
* Alternately (IE, can't read or write) [[Lolwut|shout angrily at government attempts to take over services the government itself provides]]. 
* Comparing [[Obama]]'s likeness to [[Hitler]]'s and ignoring the [[Lie|fact]] that [[Socialism|Obama's policies]] are the political opposite of Fascism and Hitler gassed Commies too. There is a much [[Stalin|more attractive mustache]] that would best describe Obama.
*When [[Republicans]] are in power, claim that [[liberals]] are a bunch of hippy pussies who are too busy trying to decide which Third World country they should surrender [[America]] to.  When Republicans are out of power, act like liberals are the SS, getting ready to kick in your door and drag your whole family into a FEMA concentration camp because you go to church.
* March around with picket signs and use your ass to talk about a myriad of issues, ranging from health care to tax cuts for those who can't afford paying them at all.
* Support officials with little to no experience in office, and who support crazy theories like forcing the US to leave the UN.
* Believe [[WikiLeaks]] is a terrorist organization, but defend [[Joe Stack]].
* Hate a civil right unless [[Ron Paul]] explicitly approves of it.

==Why We Protest==

Tea Partiers are, by and large, clueless about politics and they're pretty much against anything Übersturmfuhrer Glenn Beck tells them they're against, but their main beefs seem to be:

*[[Operations|'''Healthcare''']]. Keep Big Government out of my Medicare!
*[[Taxes|'''Taxes''']], except those that are going to fund Israel and [[military|our troops]].
*[[Black Jesus|'''Black Presidents''']], especially ones with non-white sounding names.
*[[Democrats|'''Big Government''']], because monopolies are much easier to form in a laissez-faire economy.
*[[Republicans|'''Small Government''']] because laissez-faire economies allow single companies to rule entire sectors.
*[[Government|'''Medium Government''']], because government.
*[[Bailout Plan|'''Bailouts''']], like the one [[George Bush]] gave the banking industry.
*[[Poor|'''Poor People''']], because taxes should be the same for people with less money than people who can pay those taxes.
*[[gun|'''Gun Control''']]. Tea Partiers need their guns to protect them from the military and police they're so enamored with, because their Glock will protect them from automatic weapons and thousands of Marines who like to kill first and ask questions never.
*[[Mexicans|'''Immigration Reform''']], unless those Mexicans promise to vote Republican.
*[[China|'''Deficits''']], like the ones caused by trying to give [[democracy]] to backwards [[arab|sand niggers]]. Praise Allah.
*'''[[Buy A Dog|Pet Mills]]'''.  Laws regulating that they should treat the animals humanely?  That's bad for business and will raise prices, keeping us from taking [[Zippocat|hilarious cat]] pictures and protecting ourselves from the [[Anonymous]] menace!  Also, socialism.[http://www.care2.com/causes/animal-welfare/blog/tea-party-opposes-puppy-mill-regulation/]
*[[Whistles_go_whoo|'''Being called Teabaggers''']], which is a real good way to get your foot crushed by a fatty's wheelchair as they gasp for breath in confusion.
*'''Mentioning the [[Bush]] administration during debate''', that's [[cheating]].
