Metawerx
'''Metawerx''' is a Java chat system owned by Neal Rudd. It includes several channels, the most popular of which is the [[Animu]] Capsule X (also referred to as Anime Capsule III, Anime Cel, and [[omg]] [[wtf]]). It opened in the late 90's as a replacement for [[Geocities]]'s Anime Capsule chat after Geocities was merged with (re: pwned and bought out like a bitch by) Yahoo!. ac3.metawerx.net

==Demographics==
90% of the population is [[n00bs]], 100% of which are [[drama queens]]. The other 10% are either [[assholes]], or veteran [[roleplayers]] who're slowly turning into assholes because of the n00bs. The chatroom still exists for unknown reasons, but some veterans still like to bitch at each other there.

==Economy==
Most people spend their lives playing Nijigen, a [[MUD]] that exists within the chatroom. Lots of [[IRL money]] has been spent acquiring fake items in Nijigen. Incredibly, some [[Korea]]ns have died while playing Nijigen too intensively.
