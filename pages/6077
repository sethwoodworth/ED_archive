__NOTOC__
==Original Poster==
OP is an abbreviation for Original Poster, AKA the [[asshole]] who got there first. Used most commonly on #[[chan]] boards and forums, the quality of a [[thread]] usually balances upon the OP's ability to generate [[drama]] and/or interest in whatever [[bullshit]] he's yelling into cybarspace, although occasionally [[Anonymous]] just grabs something by the scrotum and runs with it. A thread that snowballs into [[win]] can often give an OP [[unwarranted self-importance]], leading to [[faggotry]] and/or [[lulz]] if they attempt to take credit for the hard work of legion.

If a thread is [[fail]], most people will blame the OP by posting [[longcat|tautological statements]] and FAIL [[macro]]s. While this does nothing to improve thread quality, it does make everyone feel good about themselves and, hopefully, makes the OP feel bad for posting stupid shit. Interesting note - 99.9% of the threads on #[[chan]] boards are fail.

Original Posters are always [[men]], no matter how convincing the b00bs nor the accuracy of the date written around their nipples.

==OP Is a Faggot==
Sometimes you need to just let it be known on his youtube video in the comment section. For example, go to the comment section of this video and you will realize OP is a faggot!
