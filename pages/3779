Houston
[[Image:Niggerstakeoverfacebook.png|thumb|Houstonians]]

Also known as the "City of [[Fat|Sin]]" (in a <s>sad</s> bad-ass attempt to one-up Las Vegas), Houston is the largest city in "[[Texas]]".
It's the largest city in terms of overall sprawl, it's the largest city in terms of population (numbers) and it's the largest city in terms of population size (XXXXL). Seriously, these are some seriously fat ppl.

The area of Houston was once inhabited by [[Indian|injuns]] but was later reclaimed after [[Mexicans]] killed them all for [[beer]]. [[LOL]], years later Americans came and ate all the Mexican tacos and the Mexicans had to move to [[California]]. [[LOL]], then the [[niggers]]s came from a <s>time portal</s> New Orleans and bawwwwed Houston into taking them in, making it more [[ghetto]]. It is most known for its bad traffic and obesity rates.

Also the mayor of Houston is a [[lesbian]]. Take that bible thumpers!

==Attractions==
Moar [[Black]] people!

[[Image:Bud_montage.jpg|right|thumb|Horse [[piss]] and water: the taste [[America]] craves.]]Houston is also home to a [[Budweiser]] <s>Beer brewery, which has caused the entire city to smell like [[shit]]</s> Distribution Warehouse.  The horses from which they draw the [[beer]]'s main ingredient are immortalized at the front of building.  On rainy days a passing tourist might even spot the facility's [[patent]]ed method of adding a perfect mix of water to their brew.

From 1968 to 2005, Houston was home to Astroworld, where the [[teenagers]] from all around wasted their summers, and where familes spent quality time together. In 2005, Six Flags' [[Fag|CEO]] annouced that Astroworld [[Goodnight Sweet Prince|would be closed]], so that they could sell the land to developers for [[over 9000]] jew gold. However, after the site was cleared, it was sold for less than half of what was expected, and the CEO was removed for his [[fail]].

Don't forget about [[Mexicans|Taco Cabana]].

==Kolaches==
When the people of Houston founded their city with [[lazy|sloth]] and [[fat|corpulence]] the top two civic virtues they needed to invent a way they could jam the most calories into their faces as quickly and effortlessly as possible. Voilà: the Kolache, a [[Europe|Central European]] pastry that serves as breakfast food. It is commonly stuffed with [[Pen0r|sausage]], egg, cream cheese, fake fruit, jalapeños, cheese and [[Fat|lard]]. Everyone and everywhere in Houston between 5:00 AM and noon eat roughly a dozen of these artery-hardening confections. Each has approximately 450 calories.

==People & Neighborhoods==
Houston is a city of contrasts well separated by its highway system. 

'''Inside the 610 Loop - General'''

People here are constantly drunk or stoned. This is why they seem so friendly. The moment you get outside the 610 Loop, some redneck is going to pop a cap in your ass.

'''Inside the 610 Loop - Downtown'''

This is where white people commute two hours to get to every morning. They work for big oil and gas companies and they plan their day around where to go for lunch (Chili's) and how early they can get out of work to beat the traffic home (2:00 pm). Also downtown you will often see Mexican labor crews working on building more buildings or going to and from their restaurant jobs on the bus. The last group you might see downtown are female black administrative assistants. They are the only people that do any real work and they get paid 1% more than the Mexicans working at Chili's.

'''Inside the 610 Loop, west of Downtown - Montrose'''

Just west of the urban sprawl of downtown, the Montrose district of Houston is well-known for overpriced Greek eateries, incompetent bartenders, and
the kind of full-on Jew debauchery that would generally be associated with a [[gay]] bathhouse.   Known as the "MAN-trose" to those in the know, this is a great place to find varying degrees of the slothful homeless and the stains of fresh semen throughout the back alleyways.  For many this is the center of urban nightlife in Houston, and it is possible to find an all-bareback poz party at any time of the day.   Individuals new to the city will know they've reached this historic district when they are being approached by several homeless men begging for spare change and strange men promising satisfying [[Fellatio|blowjobs]].

Don't try raising a family in Montrose unless you want your kid asking why that cowboy isn't wearing pants, and why Tonto is on a leash.

'''Inside the 610 Loop, east of Downtown - The Wards'''

Full of [[niggers]] and crack whores. Going 2 blocks in will result in you getting robbed, shot, raped, and shot again.

'''Between 610 and Beltway 8, south of Westheimer - Ghetto'''

This is the ghetto. It's a swirling chaotic cesspool of violence and crime. Many factors contribute to the size and danger of this ghetto. They include:

#<del>Racism</del>LAZINESS preventing any [[black]] males from getting jobs.
#Tensions between the black man and the [[Mexicans]].
#[[Rednecks|Texans]] love guns and think everyone should have two for each hand.
#Proximity to the border means they're standing in a flood of incoming Mexican drugs.
#Spec's liquor stores and their [[Alcoholic|get 2 for 1 specials]].
#It's hot and humid and that makes people go nuts with guns.

'''Between Beltway 8 and Highway 6 - Suburbs'''

This is where the [[white people]] live in their gated communities. Everyone has a three car garage (for the three Lincoln Navigators), a heated swimmin' pool (cement pond), a 4,000 square foot house without a basement and a dog the size of a horse. No minorities are allowed to live here. During the day you might see some Mexican people cleaning houses or cutting lawns but they should be gone by the time you finish your 3 hour commute home from work. Most of the white people attend [[Fresh Prince|Bellaire High School]] where there is a lot of niggers and Jews. [[Trap]]!!!

'''Outside Highway 6 - Plains'''

This is where "cowboys" live. They all drive pickup trucks and they greet each other by shooting at nearby objects. Your status here is determined by the size of your belt buckle. In reality, nobody here is a cowboy, they're all white folks who are retired or crazy and wear cowboy costumes to make themselves feel more manly.

'''Northern Suburbs - Kingwood/Porter/Atascocita/Spring'''

Get yer church hat on. People north of Greenspoint, aka Gunspoint, secretly drink Natural Light at home when they're not out at Chili's pretending to mingle with the neighbors. You will be shot with a rifle or robbed at some point, and if you're not, you'll be run over by an eight-year-old on a four-wheeler. People go to these suburbs when they are too suicidal to even live inside the loop. Spring has a crawfish boil each year, where you will find everything but crawfish; however, if you've been waiting for Ted Nugent to play a live show, you're in luck.

Fun Fact: Everyone at the Kingwood Starbucks is actually on a layover from Bush International.

==Sports==
'''Houston Astros''': A piece of shit team that plays a game revolving around who can shoot the most [['Roids|steroids]] into a teammate's ass cheek.

While the team may be a piece of crap the Astrodome is <s>not</s>craptastic . It has housed thousands of former niggers of the flooded [[New Orleans]]. Unlike the other shitty states of America, [[Texas]] is <s>usually the most reliable</s> JK it always sucks.

==Sitting In Your Car==

There is no visiting Houston, there is only sitting in traffic in Houston. The outside world has to send in food trucks to people in their car once a week. No one hears from them again. The truth is: 2.3 million people live in Houston and they are always on the highway. [[Budweiser]] has tried to send out word to the outside world about this truth. But unfortunately, [[Stupid|they]] tried to do it on [[Fox News|Faux News]]. Everyone watching is having a hard time trying to get out of [[George Bush]]'s ass much less a large asshole city... but even those people aren't watching [[Fox News|Faux]] and [[Friends]].
