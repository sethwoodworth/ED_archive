'''Adobe''' is a software company that makes programs to allow people to turn the contrast up on [[Pictures plz|photographs]] so that they can post them to their [[MySpace]] profiles. It also owns Macromedia, the company responsible for [[Flash]]. With the widespread piracy of [[Photoshop]] and Flash, and the fact that their Acrobat Reader is free to download from their website, nobody has ever actually bought an Adobe product. Despite this, Adobe is still somehow a profitable company. This means that it either prints counterfeit money (photoshopped [[McDonalds]] coupons) or is a [[Anonymuncule|bizarre entity of antimatter that may cause the annihilation of the universe if it grows large enough]].

Somehow, between [[profit|making more monies]], Adobe still manages to [[BAW|bitch and moan]] about lonely [[basement dweller|basement dwellers]] pirating their software. Clearly, you should all be ashamed of yourselves!

==Quick guide to legally buying an Adobe product==

The purchase of an Adobe product is not a task to be entered into lightly. Many have sacrificed their lives trying to generate the [[money]] required. The below guide provides a relatively low-risk method of legally obtaining any Adobe program without resorting to [[Pirate|piracy]] or other illegal activities.

* Sell your house and all your worldly possessions.
* Sell some of your less important organs to [[science]].
* Refrain from buying [[food]]. Food is an unnecessary expenditure which can be avoided if you are willing to recycle your own [[Crap|waste]] for sustenance. Blowjobs can be dispensed to area homeless people for extra [[sperm|protein]].
* Congratulations! You now have enough funding to buy the Adobe program of your choice within the confines of the law!
* Realize you sold your computer as part of your worldly possessions, meaning you can't even use this shit, and contemplate becoming [[an hero]] 
* Repeat the entire process again in 3 months, when Adobe releases a new version of the same product, only with more bugs, memory leaks and useless features.
