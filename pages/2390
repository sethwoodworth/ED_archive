V.O:<br>
I, Nathan chronicle the tales of my people as we help mankind in secrecy<br>
But this was not always so.<br>
For we are a noble race.<br>
Sweet as candy<br>
Born in the early 70's.<br>
We are cute and cuddly.<br>

Chumsley:<br>
We helped people with their problems.<br>

V.O:<br>
That was very rewarding and we became even more well known.<br>
But in 1994 comedian John Candy died and we became a shadow people.<br>
Helping people in secrecy..<br>

Chumsley:<br>
After the nasty humans destroyed our home, we became homeless.<br>

Cassie:  <br>
And unemployable.<br>

Muffin:<br>
I'm hungry, can we order a pizza or something?<br>

Johnny:<br>
No, be quiet.<br>

V.O:

Maybe later.  Betrayed by mankind unjustly thought to be no better than them.

Billy:
Can we have pizza now?

V.O:
They may have had a point....we are werejohncandies!}}
