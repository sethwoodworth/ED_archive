'''Banksy''' is a [[Britfag]] graffiti [[vandal|artist]], wanted by [[police|the Man]] for [[spamming]] RL walls with [[forced memes]]. Unable to afford a canvas, yet somehow awash with paint, Banksy took to the [[chav]]-loaded streets of Bristol in 1992 to make things just a touch worse. Unfortunately, making more than a smeared mess with a can of Krylon takes talent, so our hero instead [[plagiarism|ripped off]] the idea of stenciling his images from [[lemonparty|Blek le Rat]]; the rest, as they say, is [[history]].

==[[Trolling]] [[IRL]]==
In order to stand out from the billion other douchebags [[SSP|spraying their lame 'tags']] everywhere, Banksy realized he needed some [[goatse|shocking content]] to get the attention of the slumbering masses. In order to goad the [[Jared Lee Loughner|hypnotized citizenry]] into squeezing out a critical thought, he began tailoring the [[OC|content]] of his work to the situation at hand.

[[Some argue]] that he is [http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/ nothing but a vandal] and should be [[v&]].

==Exit Through The Gift Shop==
{{squote|This is [[bullshit|the inside story of Street Art]] - a brutal and revealing account of what happens when [[USI|fame]], money and vandalism collide. [[Borat|Exit Through the Gift Shop]] follows an eccentric shop-keeper turned amateur film-maker as he attempts to capture many of the world's most infamous vandals on camera, only to have a British stencil artist named Banksy turn the camcorder back on its owner with wildly unexpected results. One of the most provocative films about art ever made, Exit Through the Gift Shop is a fascinating study of low-level criminality, comradeship and incompetence. By turns shocking, hilarious and absurd, this is [[shit nobody cares about|an enthralling modern-day fairytale]]... with bolt cutters.|The Movie|on itself}}

In 2010 [[The Simpsons]] wanted to seem more [[Family Guy|hip and edgy]] so Banksy storyboarded an intro to the show. [[Fox]] had it pulled.

==[[Powerword]]==
{{fyi|Banksy held an [[Ebay]] auction for his [http://cgi.ebay.com/Identity-Banksy-/260720844294 identity]?}}


[http://clatl.com/screengrab/archives/2010/10/30/are-mr-brainwash-and-banksy-the-same-person-halloween-costume-idea-alert Many attempts] have been made to discover the identity of this [[anon]], resulting in [[failure]] across the board. Banksy appears to have [[lemonparty|many friends]] and as the number of people grows the probability of his secret being kept goes down. [[Some argue]] that it is quite possible Banksy is actually multiple people, or not even a person at all but a [[conspiracy]] by the aerosol industry to sell spraypaint to [[fanboys]]. Both are valid explanations for Banksy's identity being kept safe.

Chances are he's [[you|some bloke who works the corner store and can only afford his flat with the help of mum and dad]].
