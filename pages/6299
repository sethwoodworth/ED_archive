'''Paul "Poo Breath" Wolfowitz''' is a Jew who served as [[George W. Bush]]'s Deputy Secretary of Defense, and as leader of the Zionist [[Neo-con]] cabal behind the [[Jews did WTC|Iraq fiasco]]. In last year's Gallup's ''List of the Filthiest People in the World'', Wolfowitz ranked 4th, right behind [[Britney Spears]], [[Luser|Danny Bonaduce]] and [[Fat|Kelly Osbourne]]. Wolfie's face is also part of an inspirational mosaic called [[Worst picture ever]].

After a [[Stile Project|long and interesting career]], Wolfowitz (along with fellow [[homo]] Donald Rumsfeld) became even more infamous with his appareance in Fahrenheit 9/11, the non-fiction film by [[Michael Moore]]. According to Suzanne Goldenberg's profile of Wolfowitz published in The Guardian, ''"one of the most indelible moments of the filmâ€¦ is when Paul Wolfowitz puts a generous dollop of spit on his comb before smoothing his hair for a television appearance." She observed prophetically: "Iffy grooming habits are the least of Wolfowitz's worries as he takes on the presidency of the World Bank."''

When Wolfowitz was appointed by the genius as president of the World Bank, his policies and habits were widely rejected, like urinating in public, [[masturbation|ejaculating]] into his hand before a handshake, and exposing himself with a sausage tied to the end of his penis.  He also increased his girlfriend's salary, which prompted his resignation, thank [[the man|God]].

Worst of all, during the last meeting of the [[Dark side|Bilderberg Group]] in June 2007, Wolfowitz was asked to leave permanently for using his [[goatse|rectum]] to lip-synch the song "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys" to [[Fat whore|Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands]].
