Brainwashing
{{needsmore|examples of internetz and IRL brainwashing}}The term brainwashing (also known as mind control) is a way of getting [[niggers|stupid]] [[jews|fucks]] to do or think what you want through the systematic use of manipulative methods. 

[[Theories]] of brainwashing and of mind control were originally developed to explain how [[anontalk|totalitarian regimes]] appeared to have '''[[success|huge success]]''' in systematically turning prisoners of war into [[b/tards|armies of unquestioning minions]] using propaganda and [[win|torture techniques]]. These [[theories]] were later modified to explain a wider range of [[x/|phenomena]], such as [[magic|how religion works]]. Both the American Psychological Association and American Sociological Association have found no [[science|scientific]] merit in such [[theories]], effectively [[derp|brainwashing people into believing that brainwashing doesn't exist]].

== Who The Fuck Started This Shit? ==
Brainwashing was developed in the early 1950's by [[China]] proof that China was trying to make people [[retarded]] long before they started coating [[fleshlight|children's toys]] in lead.

This was used to explain why so many American GIs defected to the enemy side after becoming POWs when really it was just all the massages with [[happy ending]]s. [[Feels good man]].

== Brainwashing And [[Magic|Religion]] a Match Made in [[Heaven]] ==

In the 1960s an increasing number of American youths started to [[I came|come]] into contact with new [[pedophiles|religious movements]], in some cases they broke contact with their loved ones and became [[an hero]]s. In the 1970s the [[win|anti-cult movement]] applied mind control theories to explain these sudden and seemingly [[encyclopedia dramatica|dramatic]] religious conversions. [[Shit nobody cares about|Psychologists sympathetic to the anti-cult movement, developed more sophisticated models of brainwashing]].  In the years that followed, brainwashing controversies developed between [[pedophiles|Religonists]], [[science|various academic researchers]], and the [[win|anti-cult movement]].










== How Do I Brainwash? ==
[[Image:Brainwash.JPG|thumb|left|Good question Spidey!]]The most fun way to brainwash someone is a combination of suggestive repetition and [[lulz|torture]]. For example; Subjecting someone to an electric shock and forcing them to stare at [[love|disturbing imagery]] while repeating over and over [[goatse|"I am your master, you will serve me"]] will eventually cause a psychotic break, causing their reality to become dependent on serving you, their master.
