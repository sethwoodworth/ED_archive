StrongPawz, aka Sterling Hurst, is a 23-year-old [[fat]] [[fursuiter]] and [[DeviantArt]] whore. He spends his days [[yiffing]] in his fursuit or in the [[NuzzleFuzzle]] chat room, mostly in his basement, or sometimes going out to [[furmeets]] and doing the same, taking care to scare the public with his disgusting figure. StrongPawz also considers himself a decent stand-up comedian.

StrongPawz likes to chat up [[wimminz]] on [[MySpace]], who respond because they are also [[fat|in his league]], thus his MySpace comments are flooded with messages from various 40-year-old baggy [[whores]]. At one point he was a total [[emo]], complaining about his [[Nobody cares|feelings]] in his dramatic [[DeviantArt]] uploads. He has the [[fursona]] of a Lion, but is doing it wrong since his fursuit [[truth|looks like a fucking pussy]].

Amazingly, [[wtf|he isn't a virgin]].

==StrongPawz the YouTuber==

StrongPawz has a dead [[YouTube]] account, still filled with [[Anime|AMVs]] and personal clips of him in his shitty fursuit and such, made over a year ago now. Most of his AMVs have had their audio track removed from copyright claims and StrongPawz [[Retard|still doesn't delete them]].

===StrongPawz on Proposition 8. WARNING: [[TL;DW]]===

[[Image:StrongPawzFlips.png|right|thumb|You mad?]]

StrongPawz has both a [[DeviantArt]] and a [[FurAffinity|FailAffinity]] account, filled to the brim with bad [[Photoshop]]s and [[fursuit]]ing pictures, mostly bad in quality or simply not funny. StrongPawz also writes fanfiction, which usually always ends up like [[shit|everything else made by furries]].
