Fuck.org is a humble internet site depicting [[W|George W. Bush]] posing for a photo with his wonderful wife. A [[homosexuality|colorful]] border surrounds the image, and clicking on it simply leads to a full screen montage of the former president dancing to [[rap]] music.

In the past (aka [[When /b/ was good|WHEN FUCK.ORG WAS GOOD]]), fuck.org depicted a [[furry]] black person [[fuck|fucking]] a blow-up penguin doll. It was originally intended as a shock site, but is really more likely to induce [[lolwtf]] than terrify.

== The Past ==
Long ago, in a more innocent time, fuck.org depicted a [[fat]] man playing a portable keyboard on a city street. The image was once a contender for [[Something Awful|Something Awful's]] [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/comedy-goldmine/greatest-picture-ever.php Greatest Picture Ever] award.
