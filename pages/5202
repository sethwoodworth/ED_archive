Marriage is love

'''"Marriage is Love"''' was the [[OP|very]] first [[colorbar]] [[meme]], intended to promote [[gay]] marriage, it quickly became a [http://www.livejournal.com/users/shared_boxers/578528.html trainwreck] of drama when anti-gay [[LJers]] came to act superior to gays.

The [http://www.livejournal.com/users/shared_boxers/578528.html original post], by {{lj|shared_boxers}}, eventually reached 11007 comments before [[LiveJournal]] barfed.

This has led to hundreds of derivative memes supporting everything from Christian beliefs to shitty [[fanfic]]. It also helped to inspire [[moroveus]]' [[leeching|image leeching]] prank.

There are three things that contributed the epidemic spread of this [[meme]]:
# It took a hot-button issue ([[gay marriage]]) and skull-fucked it.
# The "image" was implemented in pure [[html]]. Anyone could post it without having an image host or pulling bandwidth from the creator.
# The [http://www.livejournal.com/users/shared_boxers/578528.html post] that started it provides easily copy-and-pastable mark-up.

The [[meme]] eventually came to an ironic full-circle finish when [[crazayjillay]], a [[teenmommy]] whore of unrivaled stupidity, used the colorbar to create a petition to ban [[dead_babies]]&mdash;a [[LiveJournal]] humor community which is [[irony|oh-so-coincidentally]] moderated by none other than {{lj|shared_boxers}}.
