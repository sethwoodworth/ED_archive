'''Dodge cat''' is the name of a relatively common [[Caturday|cat macro]] posted on [[chan]] imageboards and elsewhere on the [[internets|nets]]. While not as well-established as other well-known [[cat]] [[meme]]s such as [[Longcat]], [[Limecat]], [[Serious Cat]], etc., Dodge Cat has spawned a plethora of [[Funny|amusing]] pictures due to its [[Oh exploitable|exploitability]] and potential for [[lulz]]. Dodge Cat's significance can best be summed up in the following quote; as a [[Drunk|drunken]] [[b|/b/tard]] once postulated:

{{squote|There are cats who became memes - they are the gods of /b/...<br>

There are the cats who make their one stunning appearance on /b/, then fade into obscurity...<br>

Then there is Dodge Cat. He has achieved demi-meme status, and lurks in the no-man's-land of the /b/sphere, uncomplainingly skiing, cooking, bowling, dj-ing, and hula dancing, knowing he will never be a true meme, but doing it all anyway. For us. Because he cares...|[[Anonymous]]}}

Dodge Cat's history seems to be a relatively straightforward one; his pic has been around the [[Caturday]] rotation for a few years, either in the form seen above or with the added caption, "[[Invisible|Invisible Skis]]."  It is [[It is a mystery|unclear]] whether anyone actually knows what the original pic of Dodge Cat looks like (without the snow), and finding it has been likened to finding the [[Holy Grail]] of Caturday macros.

Dodge Cat awareness seemed to reach an all time high when a [[Epic thread|lengthy thread]] with many pics took place on [[4chan]]'s [[b|/b/]] during 4chan's <s>5th</s> 4 and 4/4 [[4chan fgt hat day|birthday celebration]].
