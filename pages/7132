==Ryan's Ventrilo Drama==
Ryan started using [[Ventrilo]] by going onto the [[YTMND]] Ventrilo server. Unfortunately, he was hard to understand because of the blubber overlapping his mouth (and from his fan constantly running in the background to keep him from breaking a sweat merely from breathing). He was [[lol|lolled]] at and eventually Ryan decided to [[Permabanned|leave willingly]] to a different Ventrilo based on [[4chan]].

Ryan had a clean slate on the other Ventrilo for about 3 seconds before he was called out again on being a [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] tub of guts. He was just as impossible to understand unless he was [[fuck you|speaking eloquently]] in defense of himself. His [[fetish]] for butter was blown out of the water there, and he is forever reminded of his unhealthy eating habits.

Ryan also attempted to join the newest 4Chan Ventrilo server to escape persecution, but after crying to one of the administrators about how no one understands him, he was banned.

==Ryan's Response to ED Article==
The first time an article was started on Ryan it completely [[fail|failed]] because the person who started it didn't know what they were doing. It wasn't long before Ryan discovered the article and signed up to [[ED]] in an attempt to [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|blank]] it. Ryan got banned for vandalism and bitched about having an article made on him. Eventually everything was [[Complete rewrite|redone]] and Ryan declared [[butthurt]] and said he was leaving Ventrilo forever. Of course, he was only gone for 10 minutes after realizing he didn't have an [[IRL|alternative]] to waste his time.

===ARBCHAT===
Ryan requested an [[ED Talk:ARBCHAT|arbchat]] which was chaired by [[weev]]. The result was a majority vote declaring him a '''fat sack of butter-covered meat''' as opposed to a [[fat|tub of lard]]. Ryan was requested to come clean about his hatred for the butter jews and to record it on video, but he failed to comply. He got [[pwned]] for half an hour before finally told to [[gtfo]] and grow some balls about his article. [[Ryan733/logs|(Arbchat Log Available Here)]]

After arbchat, Ryan felt even [[moar]] [[butthurt]] and left the Ventrilo he was already on for one that actually [[gay|accepted him]]. He was offered a proposition: he would give his new Ventrilo information in exchange for a few pictures on the article being removed. Unfortunately, he forgot that deleting is pointless as it can be instantly reverted. So the pictures were down for about a minute... and went right back up after he gave the new [[Ventrilo]] information.
