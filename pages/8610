'''Tycho Brahe''' (aka Tyge Ottesen Brahe) Was a [[Danish]] [[Jedi]] born in 1546. Apart from having [[The Rent Is Too Damn High|awesome facial hair,]] he is loved in all quarters by all people:

*Nerds love him because he basically invented the heliocentric universe by [[trolling|guesswork]]
*Dramaticians love him because he was a [[OldDirtyBtard|reckless swordfighting alcoholic]]
*People who like forwarding their coworkers funny articles love him because he had [[I did it for the lulz|a metal nose, bought a psychic midget]], and owned a [[Space Moose|moose]] that [[Tumbles the Stairdragon|got so drunk at a party it fell down a flight of stairs and killed itself]]
*The easily influenced love him because Penny Arcade's Jerry Holkins named his online moniker after him
