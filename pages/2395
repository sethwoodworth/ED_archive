Just a little backstory behind our lovable furry pals.

{{frame|
15 years ago comedian John Candy was found dead of a heart attack at the age of 43.<br>
And misery and despair ruled.<br>
It was a dark time, a time of sadness.<br>
It was a world of disease and deprivation.<br>
It was the age of the werejohncandy.<br>
Skinny humans by day, fat furry lovable jc-like beings by night.<br>
Respected by humans but then later ridiculed and cast asside by the humans we were sworn to befriend.<br>
Hidden away in a cave for more than 15 years.<br>
Now, here in Toronto, the curfew is broken and it's time to play again.<br>
We are loyal lovable companions and the guardians of the night.<br>
We are werejohncandies.}}
