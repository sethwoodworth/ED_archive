Squirtage Wiki
The '''Squirtage Wiki''' was a [[wiki]] hosted by [[Wikia]] which was dedicated to [[Squirting|squirtage]] or [[Wimmins|female]] [[ejaculation]] - a mythical event that follows female [[orgasm]]. Described as a "healthcare" wiki,  It was hosted by [[Wikia]] in early 2010 and enjoyed some brief infamy until it was [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=30559&st=0&p=249823&#entry249823 discovered] by [[Somey]] of [[WR]] in August 2010. [[Noone]] cared, however, and the wiki got to stick around until [[Thekohser]] of MyWikiBiz wrote an expos√© on it in October. After dropping his [[drama bomb]], Kohser then called the [[Wikia]] CEO & the site [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|got deleted]] immediately. Too late for Wikia, as the story had already spread far and wide.
