[[Bandwidth]] is, technically, the amount of data that can be sent over a certain digital connection.  [[Drama]]tically, however, it's the type of stuff that users who partake in [[icon theft]], [[Frienditto]]ing, and illegal downloading steal, much to the chagrin of the bandwidth owners.

== Bandwidth as penis ==
The more you have, the better you are. If you have tons for free, it means you're invincible to issues involved with stealing it or running out or being charged for being popular. Some are said to have a supply of [[unlimited disposable]] bandwidth. ED is one of those entities.

==How to Steal Bandwidth==

<big>Stealing bandwidth is extremely fun and easy!</big>

* You can direct-link (hot Link) to a photo.  The larger the better, and if you can get multiple people to link to the picture, even better. Typically, you'll be able to screw people with [[Photobucket]] or some other free photo hosting service the best, as they get a blank placeholder after using their daily bandwidth.  Suggested places to do so: Show your boobs, [[Nouglybabies]].  [[Fusker]] is a great tool to steal lots of bandwidth extremely quickly.

* Direct-link to an [[mp3]].  mp3s are significantly larger than pictures, and will suck up bandwidth faster than [[Mediacrat]] with a [[cock]] at a [[gay bar]].

* Use [[Megaloader]]. This tool will fucking pwn the bandwidth out of any website not on the blacklist. For maxmimum lulz, make sure you use lots of images and set it to x200.
