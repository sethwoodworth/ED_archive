'''FFS''' is a phrase often seen in [[chat]] rooms that stands for "for [[fucks]] sake". It is only used by people that come from [[england|3rd world countries]]. When encountered, simply laugh at the restless native's lack of understanding of the [[USA|English language.]]  The picture is that of a typical user of the phrase FFS. Most people who use the phrase can also be found fapping to their World Of Warcraft accounts.
