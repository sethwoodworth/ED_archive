Open Source

'''Open Sauce''' refers to a method of developing poor imitations of [[Microsoft]] products.  In a radical break from traditional coding techniques, open source does away with teams of professional developers and instead relies on [[skript kiddie]]s and [[Basement_Dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[nerds]] with a only a [[Insane|tenuous]] grasp on good design and an odd fascination with their CPU usage.

The term "open source" is often thrown around as a gimmick meant to make something sound better than it really is, much like the labeling of foods as "organic". If you ask a Firefag why they use [[Firefox]], they will always mention that it's "open source", even though 99% of them don't even know what that means, and the ones who do don't take advantage of it anyway.

==Open Source Software Development==
[[Image:Computer_network_crazy_wiring_job.jpg|thumb|left|Open-source not just for software anymore &mdash; this company saved thousands by implementing an open-source IT e-solution]]

An open source project is run by one or more amateur developers, who completely control the [[nothing|number of features]] and [[fail|level of functionality]] of the project.  They must balance the competing needs of making their code usable enough to give them a feeling of superiority over [[Microsoft]] and other open source authors, but also making it complex enough to keep out [[poseur]]s and [[Internet_poor|poor people]].  If most of the program's actual users disagree with how the program operates, tough.  The developers' way is always "better, faster, and more efficient."

If you'll notice that most open source software gets rewritten constantly.  [[LOL WUT|Open Source advocates claim this is because open source products spur creativity.]]  What actually happens is most open source programs so hard to use and the documentation so poor (e.g. gibberish manual, examples in their documents are wrong and do not work, gibberish error messages, abandoned wiki with intentionally wrong information.) that it actually takes less time to go through the program's code and rewrite it than try to figure it out.

==Success(?) Stories==
[[Image:Open_Source_Game.gif|thumb|left|Every Open Source game ever.]]
Open source [[fanboi]]s will immediately refer any critics to such [[irony|success]] stories as [[Linux]], [[Firefox]], and OpenVMS. What they will forget to mention is that all of these programs are made of [[shit]]. They will also neglect to mention that open source [[game]]s suck [[teh]] [[cock]].

==Open Source Fanboys==
[[Image:Bill_Gates.jpg|thumb|Typical Open Source [[fanboy]].  Also, the main force against open source. OMG DOUBLE AGENT SPY NINJA!]]
Open source [[fanboi]]s often claim that this electronic garbage is superior to commercial software due to open source software's flexibility. Because, you know, you can reprogram it yourself to suit YOUR needs!  I mean who DOESN'T totally re-write their OS just for kicks? They also claim that relying upon the greater community helps create [[lol|logical, coherent code]], or some other reason [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody listens to]].  This is because they are all horrible, horrible [[liar]]s, and probably even [[communist]]s.

The open source movement's very existence is powered and promoted solely by these fanboys, which form a [[hivemind]] community of deceived, zealous, [[cult]]-like [[sockpuppets|puppets]], all of whom treat their belief in open source like a [[religion]].  These enthusiasts dwell in the delusion that open source is [[democratic]] and fair, even though it is a [[fact]] that: 
# the developers lack rationality, and
# the open source community is [[99.9%]] grass roots supporters and users, not contributers, who therefore have no power over the next version of anything.

Some open source fanboys like to make programs in Microsoft's [[.NET]] Framework.  Upon downloading a 50K program that promises to do everything in the world, you learn you have to download 100 megs of Microsoft's .NET libraries to make the program run.  Nobody knows if any of the programs in .NET are real or hoaxes because nobody has downloaded the 100meg .NET libraries. '''DISREGARD THAT, I'M ON DIAL-UP.
'''

==Reasons to Make a Project Open Source==

#The program is intended to do [[Illegal|naughty]] things.
#The [[programmer]] has a severe case of [[unwarranted self importance]].
#The programmer is involved in an [[E-Jihad]] with his [[e-nemy|e-nemies]], usually [[Bill Gates]].
#To support [[socialism]]
#If there is [[Is not a bug, it's a feature|a bug report or feature request]] you're too lazy to implement, you have the built-in argument "I'm doing this in my spare time for [[free]],  you [[capitalism|capitalist pig]]!"
#A [[Microsoft|real software company]] has gone [[tits or leave|tits-up]] and this is the only way the program will ever see the light of day.
#To appear on the [[Ohloh|open source-wide wanking website Ohlulz]]

== Ownership ==
[[Image:Openwtf.png|thumb|180px|right|Open source software can often be bundled with more open source software.]]

As [http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1781982 everyone knows], the true owner of all software is [[Microsoft]]. Despite this, [[Asperger's Syndrome|open source's advocates]] engage in many a [[Lulz|rational]], cool-tempered [[flame wars|discussions]] as to who controls the [[Lord of the Rings|One True Sauce]]. This leads to much [[drama]] and many frivolous [[e-lawyer|lawsuits]].

==Microsoft-Novell==
In November of [[2006]], Novell (makers of a [[shit]]ty [[Linux]] distribution), went in business with [[Microsoft]] with the apparent intention of helping [[Bill Gates]] destroy their industry from within. The deal lasted all of three weeks before the two companies allowed their mutual hatred to [[Faggot|queer]] the deal[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/22/technology/22soft.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1164715589-RsZyIkWXZ7V1vDgQtzvRtA&oref=slogin]. 

== List of abandoned open source apps ==
[[Image:Phpbbdev.gif|thumb|right|This phpbb developer enjoys butt sex, failed projects, and the matrix.]]
How can an "Open-Source" project be abandoned, can't people just come in and help?  '''Fuck you, [[asshole]]!''' Being an open source developer means you [[bitch]] and [[cry]] whenever anyone half-competent tries to repair the trainwreck that is your code.  Here are the projects which the open source programming ideology has totally ruined:
* [http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/ filezilla] (ftp client) - delayed
* [http://mozilla.org/firefox/ firefox] (homosexual browser) - gay
* [http://bersirc.free2code.net/ bersirc] (irc client) - was good, bought-out, gpl'd, all to be abandoned
* [http://www.phpbb.com/ phpBB] (php messageboard) - delayed, made of [[fail]]
* [http://www.xoops.org/ xoops] (php content management system) - ran by [[internet tough guy|mean european kids]]
* [http://www.linux.org/ linux] (operating system) - copy of unix and windows
* [http://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net/ Frets on Fire] (Guitar Hero clone) - custom songs are shit and the game crashes every two seconds. Also from [[Finland]].
* [http://www.colawp.com/colas/400/cola467_recipe.html openCola] (soft-drink) - preferred beverage of open source [[fanboy]]s who refuse to just buy Coke
* Every single open source project ever
* Australian rules Football

== Eventual collapse of the global open sores scam ==

Observe that the open sores' essence clearly has the dynamics of a Ponzi: 
* every open sores project is started by a single person
* or company in the hope to con more free labor into it,
* which in turns creates incentives for other semi-programmers to participate
* and so on
* thereby expanding the "codebase" and "mindshare" to the degree of world domination
* at which point all the semi-programmers will have a career
* ????
* PROFIT!

In theory, this COULD work. However, virtually all open sores projects are complete non-starters already, and those few that are not will eventually exhaust the limited global supply of [[aspie]]s willing to work for free. After all, there are only so many obese [[Star Trek]]-connoisseurs "living" in their corresponding mothers' basements and can afford to be unproductive and don't need hygiene or sunlight. The moment this supply ceases to last, open sores is OVER. Millions will die in desperation. Their corresponding mothers will retaliate by suffocating [[Richard Stallman]] with their corresponding fat asses. Good news/fun [[fact]]: only stupid people will be sad about all this. [[Microsoft]] ventriloquist puppets predict the collapse to happen around December 21st [[2012]] ("sucker peak"). [[Microsoft]] is the world's leader in software, innovation and prognostics, so [[you]] can bet a penny that the company ist right on the money with this [[shit nobody cares about]] except [[Steve Ballmer]], who has dancing tourette or something.
