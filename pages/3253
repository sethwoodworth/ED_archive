'''Gay Drama 2006''' was a [[LiveJournal]] gay breakup drama in which {{lj|duomaxwell1903}} opened a can of lulz all over the [[gay]] LJ communities of {{ljcomm|new_gay_boys}}, {{ljcomm|whateverfaggot}}, {{ljcomm|homos4god}}, and {{ljcomm|christiangays}}.
 
==The original post==
{{squote|Okay, I know I don't make public posts, but here goes:

I'm so PISSED at Kevin/fresyes.

We've been dating for OVER A YEAR NOW!! WERE MOVING IN NEXT WEEK!!

And Saturday nite at this party our friend Matt threw for us, HE WAS MAKING OUT WITH MATT!

I couldn't believe it! I was talking with a friend, and all of a sudden, I look over, and there's Kevin, making out with him! MATT HAD HIS HANDS DOWN HIS PANTS!!

And from the looks of things, Kevin was liking it too! He had the smile he always gets whenever I'm touching him the right way...
ANYWAY

I just can't believe him right now. He says it meant nothing, but I know it does. He probably only likes Matt anyway because he has money. I went through his bills last nite, and found out that Kevin has $20,000 in credit card debt!! FROM EXPRESS!!! What a fag! No wonder hes always moooching off of me!

Plus, he was gaining weight too. THe night I met Kevin in the club, he was so skinny, but now hes gained about 30+lbs! Talk about FATTY!

What added insult to injury was when I was online last nite, and Kevin still was signed in on AIM. This guy kept IMing me, asking me when he was going to come over again for sex!

I'm still so upset. He told me that he was going to save himself for me after we moved in together! He kept telling me what a good Christian he was, and how he always thought the whole gay scene was so slutty, and how he just wasnt like that.

But now I'm going to make sure that EVERYONE knows what a fuckin DOUCHE Kevin is. I'm sooo pissed off right now. I think I might post this to some of the LJ communities just to warn them about how TERRIBLE he is!!|duomaxwell}}

==The Aftermath==
This [http://community.livejournal.com/new_gay_boys/437760.html original post] spawned over 180+ comments in {{ljcomm|user=new_gay_boys}}, was baleeted within minutes (but not before 80+ comments were reached) on {{ljcomm|user=whateverfaggot}}, and produced an explosion of [[lulz]] in the [[gay]] LiveJournal community not seen since [http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/7766275.html George Michael [[fuck]]ed some random guy in the woods.]

More lulz occurred when boyfriend {{lj|fresyes}} [http://duomaxwell1903.livejournal.com/13409.html?thread=7265#t7265 filed an e-lawsuit] for defamation of character in [[e-court]].  Both parties were [[lol]]led out of court.
As of right now, [http://community.livejournal.com/new_gay_boys/441045.html you can vote for the bigger dramawhore faggot]. In addition, [[spam]]ming either of their livejournals or trying to score a quick [[fuck]] from {{lj|boystownhung}} can increase your [[e-penis]] by a few inches.
==In a nutshell...==

You can always rely on faggots to create drama. Copypasta is encouraged and lulz are guaranteed.
