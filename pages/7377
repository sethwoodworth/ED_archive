'''Sergio Pelico''' is a [[13-year-old boy|10-year-old boy]] from [[Texas]] who [[big dick|hung]] himself shortly after watching the [[Saddam]] hanging on TV. It is <s>speculated</s> confirmed that this story was a cover up from the boy's parents because [[Cunt|'''Sergio''']] was "[[real bad|Real Bad]]" and wanted to be just like his Uncle [[Saddam]]!


== "Real Bad" ==

[[Last Thursday]], Sergio had watched TV news with his [[Pedo|uncle]]. His [[Pedo|uncle]] said to him "[[Saddam]] was real bad." Sergio wanted to be "real bad" too, so he [[big dick|hung]] himself from his bed, similar to another [[an hero]], [[Ben Vodden]]. (And don't forget his best friend, [[Jake Roberts]]!)

Also, in another unrelated incident, a 9-year-old Pakistani boy [[big dick|hung]] himself after the [[Saddam]] hanging but [[nobody gives a shit]] because he's [[poor]].
