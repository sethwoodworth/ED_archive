Philip J. "Pud" Kaplan (born 30 October 1975) created the now failed Fucked Company website in May 2000 and wrote the corresponding book F'd Companies in 2002.

Pud is a trustifarian epic [[failfags|failfag]] who has never run a successful business. 


== The Failures ==


'''Bizient'''

Pud's brilliant plan to offer low cost web hosting. From the comments section of [http://www.hosthideout.com/archive/index.php/t-1708.html Host Hideout]

''I've always gotten the impression that Pud doesn't know his arse from a hole in the ground and his [[Fucked Company]] site, while a nice concept in late 1999 and early 2K's became nothing more than a cesspool of trolls and lamers.''


'''Jungle Scan'''

Junglescan.com was a free service that
Scans products on Amazon.com to record their sales ranking over time. It was originally called Amazon scan, but Pud had to quickly change the name after Amazon's lawyers sent Pud a message. 
Allows you to start or participate in discussions about any website or Amazon.com item. 



'''Yahotties'''

Presented attractive women spotted on Yahoo News. Yahoo! objected and probably threatened to sue Pud. He offered to give the domain to anyone who wanted it. 

While a horrible business idea, Yahotties did provide occasional [[fap]] material. 


'''Mobog'''

[http://www.pud.com/2007_11_01_pud_archive.html In Pud's Own Words]

''For those who don't know, Mobog.com was a site that I built in 2003 that allowed you to instantly upload pics from your camera phone to the Internet. If you've heard of [[Twitter]], it was similar to that, but for pictures instead of text.

''But the problem with publishing user generated photos on the Internet, is that it will ultimately devolve into porn unless heavily moderated. Sites like MySpace, Facebook, and Photobucket review every single photo that reaches the sites, and porno pics are removed.''

''And what started out as clean wholesome fun, turned into the world's largest collection of penis pictures on the Internet. Every couple of minutes, someone new would send in a picture of their penis.''

''And it was accelerating.''

''I became less concerned with the number of "unique users" visiting my site, and became worried about the number of unique penises. With about 1,000 unique penises per day, doubling every 2 weeks, I calculated that by the year 2009, one-in-three men in the United States will have uploaded a picture of his penis to my website.''

''Anyway, I shut it down. One of the more unfortunate parts is that -- as I was in the process of shutting it down -- '''I was unexpectedly informed that FHM magazine chose Mobog as #1 in their list of "50 most addictive websites."''' 

''Ah well.''

I always suspected FHM mag was run by fags.

'''Private Label Porn'''

Seriously, how does someone with money fail in porn?   
[http://pud.com/ Ask Pud.] No seriously, go to his blog and ask him because I can't figure it out.
