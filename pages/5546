Muscle March
<center>{{frame|[[Image:Muscle_march.jpg]]|color=#FFD101}}</center>

'''''Muscle March''''' is ''definitely'' one of the most awesome and frightening games ever to be made. It is made for the [[Wii]]. The game involves half naked men running around through walls in order to catch the thief who stole their [[steroids]]. While doing this, there is [[Seizure|blinking shit]] all over the place with [[Faggotry|hearts and rainbows]] splattered all over the screen while [[Jpop]] plays in the background. It's not surprising that this game is popular in [[Japan]].

The characters include an obese [[Norwegian]] [[furry|polar bear]], a [[British]] [[shemale]], an [[American]] football player, a [[Russian]] [[punk]] rocker, a [[Japanese]] bodybuilder with goggles, a [[Spanish|Spanish]] guy with a top hat and a [[Unfunny|craaaazzzyyy]] mustache, and a dude from black person who has a 'fro with a rubber [[Duckroll|duck]] on it. All are equally gay and cater to everybody's faggy muscle needs!

The gameplay basically involves moving the Wiimote to match the openings that the steroid thief makes as he breaks into offices and spaceships and shit. If you do it incorrectly you slam into a wall. Then you catch up to him and get your roids back...for now!
