Look what I found
[[Image:Lwif.jpg|thumb|right|200px|OMG LWIF!11! HOWDTHATTAMPON GET UP THERE?]]
Phrase often followed by an [[old meme]], [[crapflood]], or simply something stupid. Invented in 2108 a.d. by [[attention whores]], it will always be the newest way to call attention to one's own [[self-important]]ses. [[Troll]]s, being of sound [[internets]] mind and knowing that everything on the internets is automatically old meme, should reply with "[[i was there]]," thereby defeating the entire purpose of "look what I found!" Also used as [[sarcasm]], mimicking the posters excitement at finding something [[noone]] has EVAR S33N B 4!

==Other forms, by self-importance level==
#LWIF![[1]]1[[!]]
#LWIJF - look what I just found. "just" means that it's new
#LWIFF - look what I fucking found, possibly implying that the "find" is shocking
#WIFF! - Which I fucking found, used when someone posted something that you "found"
