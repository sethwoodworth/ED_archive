Poop drama
A short-lived [[hoax]] drama perpetrated on November 29, 2004, by [[jameth]] and [[hardvice]].  
==The Setup==
Growing increasingly bored with a dull patch in the [[Internets]], [[hardvice]] supplied [[jameth]] with his [[LiveJournal]] password and asked him to make a post for him:

<blockquote style="border: thin black solid; padding: 1em;">[18:02] <font color="blue">SpiderSalad:</font> Goodbye, Internet!<br>
[18:02] <font color="red">james98101:</font> ok bye<br>
[18:03] <font color="blue">SpiderSalad:</font> OH HEY you should make a [[hardvice]] post for me<br>
[18:03] <font color="red">james98101:</font> what<br>
[18:03] <font color="blue">SpiderSalad:</font> Post something [[insane]] to my [[jernal]]<br>
[18:03] <font color="red">james98101:</font> i would [[goatse]] it like there's no tomorrow<br>
[18:04] <font color="blue">SpiderSalad:</font> Singing, dancing [[goatse]]?<br>
[18:04] <font color="red">james98101:</font> 500% [[goatse]]<br>
[18:04] <font color="blue">SpiderSalad:</font> OK<br>
[18:04] <font color="blue">SpiderSalad:</font> Pword is {REDACTED}<br>
[18:04] <font color="blue">SpiderSalad:</font> Make me proud<br>
[18:04] <font color="red">james98101:</font> i will try</blockquote>

==The Execution==
While [[hardvice]] went shopping for a refrigerator (probably necessitated by the fact that he's a [[fatty]]), [[jameth]], working with ChrissMari and [[jeremyjx]] and a few others came up with an idea. 

<blockquote style="border: thin black solid; padding: 1em;">
(16:51:35) <font color="red">Jameth</font>: oh hay i have [[hardvice]]'s password<br>
(16:51:46) <font color="blue">JeremyJLA24</font>: haha why?<br>
(16:53:45) <font color="red">Jameth</font>: what should i post<br>
(16:54:45) <font color="blue">JeremyJLA24</font>: You should start a fake fight between the two of you<br>
(16:54:55) <font color="red">Jameth</font>: great idea<br>
(16:56:35) <font color="red">Jameth</font>: i will say that [[jameth]] mailed him a turd for christmas.<br>
(16:59:10) <font color="red">Jameth</font>: i need a picture of a [[turd]]<br>
(16:59:24) <font color="red">Jameth</font>: a big fat juicy one<br>
</blockquote>

Which led to the following [http://www.livejournal.com/users/hardvice/174268.html post] to [[hardvice]]'s journal:

<blockquote style="border: thin black solid; padding: 1em;">[[Image:poop.jpg|thumb|The alleged poop.  Note the three different colours; also, the dollar bill]]'''I cannot fucking believe what I am seeing'''<br>
You know what?<br><br>
I'm totally sick of that motherfucker [[jameth]]. Seriously. [[mediacrat|You all might think this is dramatic and you all might think this is funny]], but I am totally serious. This is not a joke.<br><br>
Many people say that his journal is "the best of the internet(s)" and so forth. What a bunch of bullshit. He is the worst motherfucker on the face of LJ and quite possibly the worst person in the world.<br><br>
You know what he did to me? I trusted him with my real address. I honestly thought he was a good e-Pal until he did this shit. Literally. He used UPS to send me human excrement.<br><br>
Do you all understand what I am trying to say here? Let me spell it out for the inept users out there:<br><br>
JAMETH MAILED SHIT TO MY DOORSTEP.<br><br>
I am not kidding. Here, I even took a photo:<br><br>
He placed the turds in a fucking DIAPER and sent it. I can't believe this. I am at a loss for words. Do you notice how there are three different colors of turds in that diaper? THREE. DIFFERENT. COLORS. OF TURDS. SENT TO ME VIA UPS. WHAT THE FUCK.<br><br>
He is going down. I have his address and I am going to get him back good. This is WAR.<br><br>
This is not a joke. Please, you guys, try not to laugh and try to realize that [info]jameth is the worst fucking person EVER for sending this type of biohazard material to my doorstep. I have already called the police and they said they will send someone out tomorrow to take a report.<br><br>
''Friend Removed!<br><br>
Success<br>
User jameth was removed from your friend list.''<br><br>
I encourage all of you to do the same. Remove this motherfucker now.</blockquote>

[[jameth]] also removed himself from [[hardvice]]'s [[friends list]]

==The Fallout==
[[Image:Poopdramacomment.jpg|thumb|right|A sample (now deleted) comment]]Almost immediately, the poop-in-a-diaper hit the fan.  The original post rapidly shot up to over 100 comments as [[dramacrats]] either expressed their disbelief or their shock, while [[hardvice]]'s non-[[dramacrat]] friends offered the ubiquitous advice (call the cops, declare [[e-Jihad|Internet jyhad]], and/or go [[friends only]]).  [[jameth]], writing as [[hardvice]], worked to assure the doubtful that it was all [[ferreal]].  To his aid came Chrissmari, playing good cop, and [[jeremyjx]], playing bad cop, and [[andrewpants]], playing the "[[jameth]] is a fucking sick bastard who ejaculated on my laundry and propositioned my dad" cop.

Inevitably, people felt the need to introduce the "[[OMG]] SOMEBODY COULD GET SICK!" variable into the equation
, and then the shit really got deep.

[[rfjason]], who later stated he had suspicions as to the veracity of the drama, headed up the "Hardvice is a moron who can dish it out but not take it" camp.

Meanwhile, ChrissMari posted the whole soiled affair to [[LJDrama]], where it had the distinction of finally being the straw that broke the server's back.  [[jameth]] posted an [http://www.livejournal.com/users/jameth/1581949.html almost apology], in the process losing [[hardvice]]'s password and thus the ability to answer comments back on the original post.

By then, though, [[hardvice]] was back from being a [[fatty]] and decided to play the short silence up as Post-Dramatic Angst Disorder, and added a second [http://www.livejournal.com/users/hardvice/174383.html post] of his own:

<blockquote style="border: thin black solid; padding: 1em;">This is not the sort of shit I need while I'm a)still recovering from being sick and b)getting ready for finals.
<br><br>
I'm deciding whether I should just delete my [[jernal]] and start again. Any minute now, the jameth goons will start in. God.<br><br>
Fuck you, James. [[Mediacrat|Just so you know, you haven't won.]] This is war.</blockquote>

With the second [[Mediacrat]] reference, more [[Dramacrats]] began to catch on, but that did not slow the pace of the comments of both support and derision.  

In the meantime, [[jameth]] decided to [http://www.livejournal.com/users/jameth/1582589.html poll his friends list] about how they'd react to a little turdmail, which resulted in one of the all-time great [[rfjason]] [[photoshop]]s:

[[Image:poodrama.gif|poodrama.gif]]

JessicaLeigh, who figured out the conspiracy, made the excellent suggestion "[http://www.livejournal.com/users/hardvice/174383.html?thread=1080111#t1080111 You should delete it if you're going to be such a fag]", so [[hardvice]] did just that, prompting [[jameth]] to make another [http://www.livejournal.com/users/jameth/1582763.html post]:

<blockquote style="border: thin black solid; padding: 1em;">[[Image:Userinfo.gif]]<s>hardvice</s><br><br>
&#58;( strikethrough<br><br>
I am really sorry, [[PowerWord: IRL Name|Dave]].</blockquote>

Of course, he rapidly followed this up with a post [http://www.livejournal.com/users/jameth/1582977.html insinuating that hardvice goons were prank calling him].  This is particularly funny because there's no such thing as a [[hardvice]] goon.

==The Punchline==
Jameth and Hardvice fessed up to the whole thing being a prank within a couple-three hours, leading to days of [[unfunny]] [[defriend]]ing drama on the part of [[butt-hurt]] gullibles.  

Despite the fact that the hoax lasted mere hours, to this day morons continue to post "[http://www.livejournal.com/users/hardvice/174268.html?thread=2131644#t2131644 HAHAHA U GOT PWNED]" comments to the original entry, more than a full year later.

Also to this day, Jameth is blamed for being a perpetual prankster who can't be trusted (despite this being the only hoax in which he's participated), while Hardvice is still generally ignored as an idiot of no particular importance.
