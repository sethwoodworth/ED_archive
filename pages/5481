'''MOOT IS OLEV''' is something Moot spammed on 4chan Dec 27. Not sure if [[Forced Meme]], not sure if [[Meme]] come to think of it. What do it mean? Is a palindrome? Is olev an anagram for love? Is [[Wapanese|Moot]] love? Probably some bullshit I shouldn't care about, but because of my [[OCD]], it's bugging the hell out of me.

At this time, it appears to come from the fact that all [[camwhore]] threads in the month leading up to this party were spammed with "WRITE OLEV ON TITS", effectively destroying said [[cancer]]. The mess that /b/ became seems to have been [[moot]] revealing that he is this "Olev" character who has been roaming [[4chan]] slaying the camwhores and their [[shit]] threads. The changes made equate to moot screaming "[[troll|'''LOL I TROL U!!!1!''']]" right in your face.

==THE COLORS==
The second stage of [[moot|moot's]] madness was to go into [[party hard|PARTY MODE]] and change [[/b/|/b/'s]] color layout to the [[Mcdonalds]] standard red and yellow. While both entertaining and lulzy to this author's amphetamine driven mind, it sure did make it hard as [[shit]] to read. However, it's easy to change the colors back to normal by putting ":resetcolors:" in all fields (including password) without the quotation marks.[[File:Sccs.jpg|thumb|right]]

No other song contained the special kind of [[fail]] necessary to be played on repeat over [[/b/]]

== Reversion of the Cancer ==

On December 29th, 2010 the <s>cancerous and horrific</s> hilarious Mcdonalds color scheme was reverted back to the traditional Futaba style. On 11:30 PM Eastern Time on December 28, 2010 the Cotton Eye Joe music had stopped. On December 29, 2010 on 5:55 PM Eastern Time MOOT IS OLEV was replaced with "RIP Cotton Eye Joe". As of that time, MOOT IS OLEV had disappeared off the face of the imageboard except among newfags who try to bring it back up complaining that they want it back because they thought it was "funny", funny though it may be. Moot, in his current state of insanity, changed the "RIP Cotton Eye Joe" to "RIP Cotton Eye Jim" as of December 29, 2010 at 11:23 PM Eastern Standard Time.
