Sandygurl
[[Image:Killme.jpg|thumb|MY EEEEEEYEEEEES]]
[[Image:15or16.jpg|thumb|I could've sworn she was 39!]]

'''Sandygurl''' (aka witch20078) is a 39 year old [[Tartlet]] who, despite what her self-proclaimed age may suggest, draws and types like a [[retarded]] [[16 year old girl]] who's high on [[crack]]. 

===Sandygurl's Habits===
Much of the inspiration for her [[shitty art|artwork]] comes from watching too many children's cartoons. She would either draw a horribly miscolored picture of a cartoon character from scratch or [[tracing|trace]] an already existing image and make it an [[original character]]. In addition to her obvious lack in artistic talent, she can't spell even if her life depended on it.

Is she a [[troll]]? [[Prolly]] not. As evidenced by this [http://reveliacastle.xepher.net/lulzwitch20078.htm transcribed chat], Sandygurl is dumb to the point where a [[lolsuit|heated debate]] would determine whether or not she is as old as she claims to be.

==Retarded Quotes==
{{Quote|"i am ingore you"|Sandygurl playing the role of the [[Internet Tough Guy]].}}

{{Quote|"back off my site jerk"|Gettin' defensive.}}

{{Quote|"i am old enough to be your mother"|Maybe so, but even [[loli|five year olds]] are [[fact|smarter than you]].}}

{{Quote|"stay site i am 2 years old i suck my thumb too you want some of my babyfood you asshole"|Sandygurl, holding her ground.}}

{{Quote|"listening here my kids look at my site. and here you are using bad words on my site. don't used bads words on my site any more. you are a *******."|Sandygurl's [[hypocrisy]] and [[Engrish|English]] mastery know no bounds.}}

{{Quote|"back off she is see someone"|Sandygurl is error.}} 




==Poetry==

When not doodling [[furries]] with an amount of skill that could easily be rivaled by a two-year old, Sandygurl enjoys writing short stories and poetry. Though short, these stories are [[retarded|mind-blowingly deep]] and could possibly give [[Twilight|Stephenie Meyer]] and [[My_Immortal|Tara Gilesbie]] a run for their money.

Here's an example of her talent:

<span id="exampleLink" class="toggleLink"></span> <span id="exampleCollapseText" style="display: none;">[NO U]</span> <span id="exampleExpandText" style="display: none;">[you fell in a hole]</span> <span id="exampleInitialState" style="display: none;">0</span> <div id="example" style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid black;">

you fell in a [[goatse|hole]]

life is like a hole in the floor

when you step through it is dark

you see nothing but dark

when you look down there is [[piss|water]]

you keep falling.
then you are drown in the water and it is dark

and scary  and creepy!

it is so black person!

the [[vagina|hole]] is big and it is so cold in the hole


This has [[rape|touched]] you in the deepest corners of your soul. Don't deny it.

== What Other Tarlets Think of Sandygurl==
{{quote| Shut up you idoit. [[Furfag|Chibicyndaquil]] draws better than you. Heck, even :icon[[chasethehedgehog]]: draws better than you. YOU HAVE NO TALENT WHAT SO EVER. MY FIVE YEAR OLD COUSIN CAN DRAW BETTER THAN YOU. End of the story, you crazy bitch  now [[GTFO]].|SM00THIE101, speaking the truth.}}

{{quote|oh you must be retarded like my housemate Sherie then... she's 41 and traces too and can't spell anything either. I'm so sorry, I shouldn't pick on "special" people, it's so easy to make a mistake, we can't all be an intelligent 23 year old like me.|kohakuhoshi, being equally stupid like everyone else.}} 

{{quote|No, I just came along. I just think it's rather stupid to say you're ignoring someone, then starting to argue with them again.|Msmatched, who actually knows how to type in complete sentences.}}

{{quote|how old are you, seriously?|MagicalEggplant, who has every right to be suspicious.}}

{{quote|Drawer's block is usually cleared up by having some talent|jezko, calling Sandygurl out.}}

== Deanna, Ace Reporter!==
Thanks to how DeviantART made a fucking mess with the News system, anyone can post shit into it and it doesn't get deleted.  This is what happens when Sandy goes near it.  Kinda like letting a kid with Down's Syndrome near news recording equipment. 

'''wow ! this is a good news'''

my daugther meet [[My Chemical Romance|chemical romance]] in person .
my daugther krystle meet this group in person she was very happy . she loves this group very much .[[Emo|she loves their songs alot]].

'''well here is my news'''

i love all kinds of music like ozone, [[Gay|backstreetboys]], nelly , country . [[What|music is my life sometimes]].

== Sandygurl's chil'rans ==
Two [[16 year old girls]] and a [[13 year old boy]] have the great misfortune of being Sandygurl's children. They mean the whole world to her so much that she [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/32574970/267850946 definitely knows how old one of them is.]
