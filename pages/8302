The Shadow
'''Robert M. Cassidy''', aka The Shadow, The Saddo, "that Geordie faggot" and "oh just fuck off already, won't you" is an [[aspie]] [[drama]][[fag]], notorious sufferer of [[borderline personality disorder]] and former member of [[Anonymous]].

==In the beginning==

[[Image:Saddo_mask.jpg|thumb|The least effective disguise in comic book history]]
He first made [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|a name for himself]] on [[WWP]] as a sad paranoid fuck who was convinced that there was a massive mod conspiracy against him because all his blatant attempts to [[leaderfag]] Chanology [[Epic fail|failed epically]]. Other anons resented this egofaggotry, and trolled the merry fuck out of him on little known [[British]] homosexual imageboard [http://britfa.gs britfa.gs], causing him to [[RAGE|raaaaage]]. [[Insane|Logically]], he blamed a [[tinfoil|massive mod conspiracy]], and attempted to [[troll]] Why We Protest and its users by name/facefagging other anons, pretty much the only crime on WWP still punishable by the [[banhammer|death penalty]]. Unsurprisingly, he got [[b&]] because [[Lies|Mods have feelings too]], causing the other users of the site to pretty much recognise him for the crazy freak that he was.  However, a little thing like public humiliation wasn't going to deter him, and so he created [[over 9000]] sock accounts as a form of impotent revenge. Unfortunately, because most of them contained the word "Shadow" in some form or another, it wasn't exactly hard for Sue and co. to spot who the frickin' genius behind it all was, and all the socks were promptly banned as well.

Teh Saddo had his revenge though!!!!1111eleventyone! [[nerdrage|He showed them]] by spending literally days at his computer tagging threads on WWP with  his own handle.  Being a freaky aspie, yet at the same time lacking the [[1337]] skills to write even the most basic of scripts to automate the process, dear Rob spent the best part of a week (by his [[truth|own admission]]), manually going through almost every thread on WWP and adding the tags one-by-one.  Quite why the mods didn't spot this as it was happening is anyone's guess, but the general consensus is that they, along with the rest of the forum users, were too busy pissing themselves laughing at Shadow's utter lack of perspective (or a life, [[amirite?]]).

==The Life and Loves of The Shadow==
Amazingly, though all of this, Rob had managed to hold down an [[IRL]] relationship with an actual [[girl]], although, displaying an uncharacteristic wisdom, he managed to keep her well away from Anonymous, only allowing certain tidbits of information to slip out, such as the time he earned his brown wings by [[buttsecks|pounding her in the shitter]] and then washing his [[cawk]] in the sink.  It is widely speculated that their favourite sex game involved her dressing up as Peter Venkman and exclaiming "He slimed me, Ray" as Shadow sent his sticky messages of love streaming across her face.  However, eventually she realised that she could have a far better time with someone who didn't regard Captain Kirk as a fashion icon, and promptly kicked his arse to the kerb.

Next, Saddo developed an obsession with Loldon protest [[cumdumpster]] Namenlos, despite them barely ever spending any time together, her thinking he was a bit of a sad git (on account of him being a grown man who plays with [[Faggot|Sylvester McCoy]] dolls), and the closest them ever coming to having any physical contact being a reluctant [[rape|squeeze]] or two on London raids like the serial rapist that he is.  Nonetheless, this didn't stop him suffering from intense [[butthurt]] when she started a relationship with a man who [[Truth|didn't spend raids and social gatherings sulking in a corner for attention]] and wasn't the world's saddest [[cosplay]]er, and so Saddo indulged himself in a BAWWWWfest of hitherto unknown proportions.  Rumour has it that this fit of depression left him unable to complete work on his full-scale TARDIS (moar like RETARDIS, [[amirite]]) replica; all we know is that coupled with the pent-up rage he was still nursing from everyone else in [[Chanology]], and his latest ban for perpetuating the same drama and faggotry as he had before, Saddo threw his toys out of the pram yet again and ragequit Anon, posting [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TGXgl0QJH8 this video] (text below).  [[Last Thursday|Not too long after]], he also posted a message on his [[Facebook]] wall, stating that he would be "removing all members of a certain mask-wearing group" from his friends list within 24 hours, [[nothing of value|which he promptly did]]. OH NOES!


==Epic ragequit text (WARNING: Massive tl;dr follows)==
{{Quote|Dear Anonymous;

It is with a [[Fag|heavy heart]] that I must leave you, and I would like to explain the reasons for my departure. I owe you that much at least.

The truth is, I have gone through a lot of personal issues in my life away from Anonymous, and this has affected me in ways I did not expect or want. I have lost a lot of my spirit for doing lots of things, and sadly, that includes my part in Anonymous. I still believe in the cause, and I WANT to continue...I want to continue so, so badly, but I feel unable to do so as effectively and with as much dedication as I have in the past. Maybe some day I will get back whatever it is I have lost, and I will be able to return. But I have to [[Ragequit|leave now.]]

I've taken a lot of criticism over the past two years, mainly from people who decided that they just don't like me. They consist of two key groups. The first group is the WWP staff. I tried to make a stand against their site-wide faggotry and I do not regret it- it was the right thing to do. So it only remains for me to say this to the WWP staff- go and fuck yourselves with an iron pole. The other group is people who are all talk and no action...keyboard jockeys who will happily sit and post about what needs to be done, criticising those who do actually do something and the way they do it, whilst they themselves have never even set foot at a protest. To those people, I say this: [[Unwarranted Self Importance|I have done more than you, I have contributed more than you....and in the end, that's what really annoyed you most about me, isn't it?]]

I am proud to have been part of Anonymous. Anonymous is not your friend...is the most misleading statement in the world, [[Hug|Anonymous CAN be your friend]], and it has been mine. It has been something worthwhile in my life and it has made me a better person in my real life. I have had experiences outside of what is normal for me, what I am used to...I have loved and lost because of Anonymous, and that's okay by me.

I would like to thank London Anonymous in particular for their kindness, hospitality, their friendship, and for [[Trufax|putting up with so much of my fail]].

To those of you who are still fighting the fight, I salute you. I have seen Anonymous achieve so much in the past two years. And what you haven't done yourselves, you have enabled others to do. You have the truth on your side, and because of that you are the biggest threat Scientology has ever faced. They are SCARED of you, I have seen this with my own eyes. And not even in large numbers...I have stood across from Scientologists, ALONE, and watched them panic. THAT is the true power, not their Fair Game, intimidation, or lawsuits. I have complete faith that you will succeed in bringing down Scientology...I only hope that when you do, I'm still around to see it.

Take care of each other and stay strong.|The Shadow, ragequitting Anon for the 9001st time in typical [[tl;dr]] fashion}}

==Recent lulz==
[[Image:HereticCunt.png|thumb|This is what OCD looks like, kids.]] 
Some speculate that bucktoothed inbred mongo-fuck [[Diamond Anastasia|Bluebell]] may be the latest target of his affections, but frankly the very thought of those two together would be enough to turn the stomach of even the most gore-thread-hardened /b/tard.  Anyway, when this repulsive cunt managed to get itself banned from WWP for being, well, basically a repulsive cunt, Shadow's [[white knight]] instinct kicked in, and soon he was up to his old tricks again, locking himself in his [[basement|room]] with only his blu-ray copy of Ghostbusters II and his sonic screwdriver for company, and after a mere [[over 9000]] hours of frantic keyboard hammering, he'd once again [[pointless|stuck it to the man]] by editing WWP's most popular tags list to feature the phrases [[Trufax|"Heretic = fat cunt"]] and "Heretic = cancer". All of which was [[lulz|very impressive]] and a [[truth|complete waste of time]] as the mods, being actually able to work a computer with a degree of competence, simply removed the offending tags in a matter of a couple of hours.

Just [[last Thursday]], it was Shadow's 26th birthday, and so he posted the following message on the [http://britfa.gs/emo/res/6024.html britf.gs/emo board]:

[[Image:Saddo_BAWWWWW.jpg|1000px|center]]

Because /emo/ lives up to its name, and is a home for faggot-ass Brits to indulge each other's blatant [[attention whore|attention whoring]], he actually received a degree of sympathy for his whiny [[BAWWWW]]fest, although a couple of posters, recognising his particular brand of [[fail]] for what it was, suggested he either [[an hero]] or [[unrealistic expectations|start acting like a 26 year old man]] instead of a pre-pubescent no-life.  We wait to see what the next chapter of the [[lame|exciting]] [[drama]] that is his life holds in store.
