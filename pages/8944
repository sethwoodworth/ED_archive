'''Websense''' is the [[bullshit|World's #1 Internet Filtering Software]] and a forerunner in [[Security Faggotry]].  It is [[always|typically]] used by [[school|various institutions]] to prevent access to [[Hacker|l337 Hax]], [[Pr0n]], and [[lulz]]. It is favored by overzealous [[Security Faggots|system administrators]] who continually show their superior intellect by paying someone else to block [[stuff|inappropriate webpages.]] People will [[Fact|almost always]] find their efforts to [[youtube|watch videos]], [[email|check email]], play [[games]], or [[4chan|avoid work]] quickly be met with a block page. Even legitimate attempts at [[research|work]] are usually [[raped|foiled]] by Websense's superior [[Mega ultra super genius|intellect]]. Websense prides itself on reminding us that [[teh internets]] is a [[Serious business|tool for work, not play]]. 

==Primary purpose==
* [[Insane|Fucking with your mind]]
* Providing other means of [[lulz]] by attempting to circumvent Websense
* Enforcing an institutions <strike>Internet Policy</strike> [[Bullshit]]
* Separating people from [[Social networking sites|their friends]]
* [[Suicide]]

==Response==
[[Image:Fucked by websense.png|thumb|[[13 year olds]] getting [[rape|a taste]] of Websense.]]
The typical response to Websense is headed up by [[13 year old boys]] who know [[nothing|little]] about the English language and working around others [[faggotry|bullshit]]. Internet tech forums and Yahoo! Answers will be flooded with questions such as:

{{quote|OMg!!!1!!eleven! mai schewl blocked my comupter with teh websnese and now i cant play [[runescape|prunescape]] or check mai [[facebook]]!..!!1 Someone pl0x hax it 4's me!|A 13-year-old boy}}

Although most [[retarded|able-minded]] people are capable of bypassing it by means of [[proxy]] sites, some simply admit defeat and commit [[suicide]], or reluctantly do [[suicide|actual work]]. Those who do succeed in bypassing the filter usually invoke the [[rage]] of their [[Security Faggots|system admin]], leading to contact with [[Party Van|people who might actually give a shit]].  Because of peoples [[retard|inability]] to [[The Google|figure anything out for themselves]], hundreds of [[youtube]] videos devoted to  bypassing websense are added daily, each less helpful than the previous.
