Silicone

'''Silicone''' is a wonderful material harvested from the breasts of prostitutes and pornographic actresses in order to make computer chips.  This explains why so many young men are inexplicably drawn to [[masturbating]] in front of their computers for hours at a time.  This also makes sense because chipmakers like [[Intel]] are a bunch of whoremongers anyway.

Each square inch of titty is roughly equal to 50mhz.  Very small chips need to be made from very small titties, which probably excites you if you're a sick [[lolicon]] fuckwad.

If you see a woman with large silicone deposits walking down the street, it's considered socially acceptable to grab them, taste them for consistency, and then compliment her on all the wonderful [[computers]] that she'll help to assemble. Similarly, if you should come across a woman with little or no silicone deposits, you must question her as to if she has recently had her deposits harvested and if not denounce her as a strumpet and a harlot to all in the vicinity.

===Where to find it===
Generally you will see this stuff attached to an attention starved white female that wears very little, or no clothing. If you go to a sex shop in your are, you'll see these creatures there buying [[dildo|inanimate objects]] that they can insert into their [[vagina]].

Other locations where you can find silicone are:
*[[Your Mom|Your Mother]]
*[[Dell]]
*[[Paris Hilton]]
*Home Depot
