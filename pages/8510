Trancy.Mick is a [[Japanese]] [[furry]] artist, who created a weird [[furry]] character named Rain Silves, sprouting a short-lived [[4chan]] meme of "everyone is furry for Rain" and "Rain loevs raep".

==Rain==

General Rain Silves is a Sergal, which is some kind of inbred mixture of a [[WTF|shark, raptor, and a dog.]] Rain is the [[W|leader]] of the Tatola Desert tribe of Sergals, also known as the "[[North Korea|Shigu Clan]]". The members of this tribe are distinguishable due to their long fur (in comparison to the Sergal of the [[Nakedgirlparts|South Sailzan Desert tribe]].)

She is slightly different from the average Sergal. She is much [[giant|taller]] and has an eye color mutation which causes her eyes to have a golden pigment instead of grey or blue. She is known to wear [[Art School|ceramic armour]] into battle and wields what seems to be a [[penis|double-bladed lance]] of some sort. She uses the blood of her enemies, or her companion, Gin, to paint the [[emo|'blood-trails' that originate from her eyes.]]

The most interesting part of her anatomy is the [[lol wut|'''prehensile clitoral hood''']], which [[wat|resembles a tongue]]. [[Some argue|Some people]] mistake this for a penis and think that Rain is a hermaphrodite; however, she is female. We think. but Rain is, In fact, [[fail|Win]].

For the Swedish word for rain, see [[Regn]]

==Engrish==
[[File:Rain2.jpg|thumb|riggt|[[lol wut]]?]]
Trancy's [[engrish]] is a sauce of [[lulz]].

"''[[wat|I write the simple commentary of Sergals here.]] [[lol wut|And as for the personality of Rain. Sergal is the creature which is near to Raptor biologically.]] [[Life]] is about the same as a human being, but many people [[an hero|die without becoming 30 years old by a fight.]] [[lol|Their staple food bites a small animal and fish such as rabbits to death]] and [[jam it in|does cram it]]. In addition, they hunt a [[lolcow|large-sized grazing beast]] if they have an edged tool. An average height is 6~6.4feet. Rain is large, and height is 7feet. [[Pedo|She kidnaps an infant and a boy]] of an enemy by gluttony and eats. [[what|Rain is brutal, but is more honest in a desire than malice.]]  [[WTF|She will want to eat more children.]] There are two races in Sergal, and a group of north Tatola Desert is long fur. A group of south Sailzane Desert is short fur. These groups fight from [[At least 100 years ago|an old days]]. [[Bloodninja|They put on a ceramic armor]]. and arms are black person. Their strong legs are the [[OVER 9000|horse levels]]. Rain is the head of north group. However, "[[nobody|wolf Sir Zyn Crotzwel]]" of an aide lends a brain to Rain because many Sergal's [[Retard|heads are not good]]. [[stupid|The intelligence of Sergal is man's 14-years old child level]]. Character of Sergal is various. What I can say equally is for them to be the loyalty to the boss. Sergal other than Rain have eyes that are gray or light blue. Rain of golden eyes is a mutant. There is not a person having it other than her. Rain was [[pwnt|discriminated]] by the colors of her eyes at young time. Even her mother. People said "eyes of Death" and avoided it for fear of childish Rain. A certain meaning and "Eyes of Death" were true. She became splendid Death. haha.'' "
