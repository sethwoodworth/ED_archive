Unreal Tournament
The '''''Unreal Tournament''''' series are a bunch of [[FPS]] games that spawned from ''Unreal'', a [[sci-fi]] game about exploring an [[alien]] planet. Now ''Unreal'' is usually associated with the arena [[FPS]] games full of deathmatch, M-M-M-MONSTER KILL, and completely fucktarded mods.

==The Games==
[[Image:Xan_kriegor.jpg|thumb|right|Xan Kriegor. What a badass.]]
[[Image:Malcolm.jpg|thumb|right|Responsible for kicking Kriegor's robotic [[ass|rump]].]]
*'''''Unreal''''': The 1998 game and starter of this madness. In ''Unreal'', you play as an [[anonymous]] prisoner who is aboard a ship that is going to some maximum-security prison planet or some dumb shit but it crashes on the planet of Na Pali. The natives of the planet, some [[Hindu]]-god looking creatures called the Nali, are under attack by some lizard-bug-aliens called the Skaarj. The Skaarj have invaded the planet because it contains [[Crystal meth|Tarydium]], which, when grounded up, can be awesome to [[drugs|snort]]. When the Skaarj Queen is killed at the end of the game, the prisoner hops into an [[EVE Online|escape pod]] as the Skaarj mothership blows up. Unfortunately, the [[lol|pod runs out of fuel, so the prisoner is left to float in space.]] Aside from the single-player storyline, there is also multiplayer which basically became ''Unreal Tournament'' (because [[Epic]] Games = [[lazy]]). [[Srs|Some of the maps are actually reused in UT]]. Oh, and it's the inspiration behind ''[[Avatar (movie)|Avatar]]''.
:*'''''Return to Na Pali''''': This is the expansion. The ''UMS Bodega Bay'' finds the prisoner floating around like a [[retard]] in [[space]]. The crew of the ship finds out that the prisoner is, well, a prisoner, and [[Rape|forces]] him or her to find the downed ''UMS Prometheus''. When the prisoner finds [[Dox|SEKRIT SPACE DOX]] in it, it turns out the crew of the ''Bodega Bay'' are evil and they get mad. They try to kill the prisoner who escapes... again.

*'''''Unreal II: The Awakening''''': The sequel of ''Unreal'' of course, though some consider it to be fine on its own but as a sequel, kind of [[meh]]. The protagonist is John Dalton, a former marine, and he's assigned to find pieces of an ancient weapon that will be [[uber]] when assembled.

*'''''Unreal Tournament''''': Released in 1999 and the most popular of any game in the series. There is actually a plot: In 2291 and the New Earth Government has noticed that [[EVE Online|space miners are beating the shit out of each other]]. What do they do? Legalize fighting of course! With the help of the Liandri Mining Corporation, they create the tournaments. Now it's 2293 and [[you]] are part of a team of [[faggot]]s and are destined to win the tournament. Also, a black dude called Malcolm of the Thunder Crash team defeats [[Badass|Xan Kriegor]] and becomes the champion for like nine years.

:The game itself is full of people abusing the fuck out of the flak cannon and rocket launchers, and techno oontz oontz music. It is interesting to note that this was going to be ''Unreal'''s expansion pack but turned into a game of its own.

*'''''Unreal Championship''''': Released in 2001 for the [[Xbox]]. It promised features like vehicles and 64 players on one map. TOO BAD IT FUCKING SUCKED.

:*'''''Unreal Championship 2''''': Released in 2005 for the [[Xbox 360]]. It has a lot of melee weapons such as staves that can freeze people and crush their skulls. It was obviously much better-received than its predecessor. The backstories [http://liandri.beyondunreal.com/Lauren#Alternate_reality.3F caused some fans to think that there was an alternate universe, because if some major characters were killed and revived as Necris, why didn't they use the respawner instead]?

*'''''Unreal Tournament 2003''''': [[At least 100]] years later, an [[China|empire]] rises and the [[Duck|Emperor]] originally thought that the tournaments were [[truth|pretty fucking stupid]]. That was, until he realized that [[idiot]]s eat this shit up and would pay to see [[Warhammer]] guys, [[goth]]s, and [[furry]] [[alien]]s blow each other up.

:Most of the fans of UT thought UT2003 was shit because the new gameplay features were [[fake boobs|tacked on]], such as adrenaline, where you collect [[drugs|pills]] by killing or finding them and getting power-ups through them. Double-jumping also brought forth [[rage]] from the UTfags. OH NO NEW FEATURES!!! Another thorn in the side of UTfags was the excessive nerfing of most the guns which, combined with the new spaz happy gameplay, made it damn near impossible to kill anyone in a reasonable amount of time.

*'''''Unreal Tournament 2004''''': UT2003 with MORE SHIT! There's like OMG VEHICLES AND STUFF! The vehicles include:
:*the '''Manta''', a land hovercraft that can crush people's heads off,
:*the '''Scorpion''', a one-person car that can [[shot web]] and slice people up,
:*the '''Hellbender''', a truck for three and used for sniping,
:*the '''[[Dakka|Goliath]]''', a tank with DAKKA DAKKA,
:*the '''SP(a)MA''', a long-ranged [[military]] vehicle used to spam lolbombs on anyone stupid enough to stand still til they get there.
:*the '''[[WTC|Raptor]]''', a flying vehicle with missiles,
:*the '''Paladin''', much like in WoW, the paladin is a tank used by noobs to pwn other noobs. That's about all it's good for.
:*the '''Cicada''', a bomber used to [[troll]] the fuck out of everyone.
:*and the '''Leviathan''': A huge vehicle that has a missile spammer, 4 turrets for spamming lasers, and unfolds to pull out a huge laser that blows the crap out of everything.

:Needless to say, UT2004 players seemed to only really like deathmatch and not much else as the other game modes highlighted the nerfed weapons problem and the vehicle modes meant dying quickly to spawn camping vehicles.

*'''''Unreal Tournament 3''''': While this game was liked a bit more by the UTfags, the UT2003 and UT2004 fanboys complained about the removal of certain dodging tactics and shitty single-player mode. More vehicles were added and certain teams/races got certain vehicles. Additionally, the weapons were slightly denerfed, making them "OMG OP!!!" for the UT04 noobs and still too weak for the UT1 oldfags.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:UT2004_assault.gif|thumb|ASSAULT!]]
[[Image:Unreal_tournament_2004_ball.jpg|thumb|right|Bombing Run in UT2004.]]
[[Image:Unreal_tournament_3_gameplay.JPG|thumb|right|A vehicle in UT3. Beep beep [[motherfucker]].]]

*'''Assault''': One team defends something and the other attacks it. Some of them are objectives like "go into the mothership, and attempt a [[suicide]] mission by destroying it from the inside," "go onto a convoy and steal some missiles," or "blow this shit up because it will be COOL." It's essentially "Warfare" in UT3.

*'''[[Disgraced|Betrayal]]''': In UT3, Betrayal mode allows you to gain points by [[pwn]]ing your [[friends]].

*'''[[Jihad|Bombing Run]]''': Space FPS basketball in UT2003 and UT2004 but for [[Shit nobody cares about|some reason]] was dropped in UT3. Unfortunately you don't get to suicide bomb anything, despite the name.

*'''Capture the Flag''': [[Obvious]].

*'''Cloak Match''': A game type from ''Unreal: Return to Na Pali''. Whoever kills first gets to [[pwn]] more until [[No girls|s]]/he is killed, and the killer gets the "cloak" of PWNAGE.

*'''Cooperative''': In ''Unreal'', you and a few other fags play single-player levels. In UT3, you play as one of the Ronin guys and team up against the Necris bots.

*<b>DarkMatch</b>: ''Unreal'''s Deathmatch except it's ''[[Doom 3]]'' dark.

*'''Deathmatch''': Shoot the shit out of everyone. There are power-ups lying around along with [[Drugs|adrenaline]] in the newer games, that when 100 is obtained, codes can be entered for [[Batman|superpowers]] and shit. Team Deathmatch is... well, deathmatch with a red and blue team.

*'''[[BSDM|Domination]]''': Capture the level's control points. You actually needed to [[TF2|work with people]] in order to get shit done. '''Double Domination''' sucked because only one player could guard a point at a time and it was too [[annoying]].

*'''Duel''': Two players fight in a small map. Whoever [[win]]s will continue on and the [[You|loser]] will go to the end of the line.

*'''Jew''': This was originally a fanmade UT2004 mod. The guy who created it now works for Epic Games. Basically you collect skulls from killed players and you lug them to the enemy base.

*'''[[Borderlands|Invasion]]''': Monsters from the first ''Unreal'' game swarm in waves, and you gotta shoot the fuck out of them. If you die, you spawn in the next wave.

*'''[[Hank Hill|King of the Hill]]''': ''Unreal'' only. Whoever kills first gets to be glowy and awesome and you try to stop that faggot from being glowy and awesome.

*'''[[Super Smash Bros.|Last Man Standing]]''': Everyone starts with a number of lives, health, and armor. Self-explanatory. Surival is similar.

*'''[[Marines|Marine]] Match''': In ''Unreal'' only. Space Marine bots hunt you and your dumb friends down.

*'''[[Derp|Mutant]]''': Whoever kills first becomes the Mutant. He will keep on losing health but will be really strong otherwise. That is, until he's killed. [[Noone]] cares about this gamemode.

*'''[[Genocide|Nali Slaughter]]''': A UC2 gamemode. [[Holocaust]] all the [[Hindu|Nali]]!

*'''Onslaught''': Using vehicles in UT2004, you have to take over power nodes to short out the enemy team's power core.

*'''[[An Heroine|Overdose]]''': In UT3. Radioactive [[balls]] are delivered to goals.

*'''[[Tldr|eXpanded MultiPlayer]]''': Class and vehicle-using multiplayer in ''Unreal II''. Since nobody cares about ''Unreal II'', not much needs to be said about it.

==Characters and Teams==
[[Image:Domina_figure.jpg|thumb|right|[[BSDM|Domina]] has a serious case of [[DAT ASS]].]]
[[Image:Selket.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hawt]].]]

Aside from the single-player games, ''Unreal Tournament'' games actually have characters with short backstories, along with their teams. One of the main characters is Xan Kriegor, a cybernetic being who was the champion for the longest time until Malcolm kicked his ass in 2293. Liandri upgraded him to Xan MK II but that [[fail]]ed also. Currently he is Xan MK III.
<br><br>
[[Malcolm X|Malcolm]] is, of course, a tough [[black]] [[dude]] that made Xan [[Bawwwww|QQ]] and lose his [[E-penis|title]] in the tournaments. He is part of team Thunder Crash. However, [[Warhammer|Gorge]] [[LOL|breaks his spine]] in [[2012|2302]], and becomes a commentator instead. He also asked some [[Egypt]]ian guy called [[Yugioh|Anubis]] to join his team, but Anubis was like "lol [[no]]."
<br><br>
Some other teams and characters include:

*'''Thunder Crash''': A military-themed team of [[black]] people. Okay, so there's one [[white]] guy. They include the leader, Malcolm, a [[rape]] victim, Tamika, a [[con]]vict, Jakob, and a bunch of other tough black people.

*'''The Necris''': A race of [[vampire]] [[goth]]s or something. They come from [[Twilight|Omicron 9]]. In the ''Unreal Championship'' games, Lauren and Brock, two lovers, committed suicide. Liandri Corporation paid a fuckton of cash to Phayder Corp so they could revive the two as Necris. Another major character that becomes a Necris is [[slut|Selket]], a Nakhti woman who fought only for [[money]]. She married [[Yugioh|Anubis]]. [http://liandri.beyondunreal.com/Lauren#Alternate_reality.3F Some consider this basically fanfiction though.]
:*'''The Necris Black Legion''': The Phayder Corporation's own team of [[Hot Topic]]-upped fags with guns!

*'''Black Legion''': These guys are different than the Necris version. They are deformed mutants and test subjects that sport [[Joker]] faces and [[BSDM]] gear. [[:Image:Domina_figure.jpg|Domina]] is one of them.

*'''[[Juggernaut|Juggernauts]]''': [[Warhammer]]-esque [[rage]]-filled convicts who were genetically boosted. They are very bulky considering they're wearing [[Xbox|hueg]] armor from the Axon Research Corporation.
:*'''Goliath''': Their [[recolor]]s.

*'''Hellions''': [[Punk]]-looking [[pirates]] who are famous for stealing missiles from the New Earth Government. They like to drink, sleep with their fans, and swear a whole fucking shitload.

*'''Sun Blade/Egyptians''': Related to Earth's Egyptians, the Nakhti formed the team Sun Blade. They were put into the game to appeal to ''[[Yugioh|Yu-Gi-Oh]]'' fanbois. One of their members, Diva, is [[JB]] with a rocket launcher.

*'''Blood Reavers''': A team in UT99 who are interested in cash only. The female members have [[Christian|crucifixes]] on their stomachs.

*'''Dark Phalanx''': Human military specialists that helped win the Human/Skaarj War.

*'''[[Biting Beaver|Venom]]''': UT99's team of [[feminist]] [[Sports|athletes]] who fight against the New Earth Government's patriarchal society.
:*'''[[Gay|Raw Steel]]''': The male version. They are [[Gears of War|muscleheads]] who are probably [[homosexual]].

*'''[[Lulz|The Corrupt]]''': Liandri Mining Corporation's own team of cybernetic fighters led by Xan Kriegor. They were pretty much designed to be [[:Image:Cathode.jpg|sexy feminine robots]] and for advertising, but they can also blow shit up in the arena.
:*'''Metal Guard''': [[Chanology|Psychotic mask-wearers]] who serve Xan Kreigor in UT99.

*'''[[Robot|Blood Fist]]''': A group of cybernetics with [[Internet tough guy]] names like Widowmaker and Rapier.

*'''Iron Skull''': In UT99, the New Earth Government [[lulz|mixed]] humans with Skaarj to make super-hybrids in the Iron Skull team. '''Red Claw''' are similar. In later games, the Iron Skull team appears to make up lost honor from their mothership being destroyed.
:*'''Black Fist''': The Skaarj enemies of the Iron Skull clan. That's it. Really.

*'''Gen Mo'Kai/Fire Storm''': The Gen Mo'Kai are a race of feathery-[[tentacle rape|tentacle]]y [[alien]]s that are a warrior race from a forest planet, Arborea. Their team is Fire Storm, lead by Damarus, the son of the Mobeth tribe leader Gik Ma. His sister Mokara is jealous of him, and his teammate Nebri wants to [[fuck]] him even though she's so [[fugly]] she has to [[EFG|wear a mask]].

*'''Ronin''': A team of [[weeaboo]]s in UT3. They work for the [[Japanese]] Izanagi Corporation. They're all about honor and that shit.

==Weapons==
[[Image:UT3_biorifle.png|thumb|right|[[Shit|SHIT]][[Gun|GUN]]!]]
[[Image:Rocketlauncher-2003.jpg|thumb|right|Everyone uses this.]]
The ''Unreal Tournament'' series has, obviously, multiple weapons, many which cause whiny [[13 year-old boy]]s to scream "OMG STOP USING THE ROCKET LAUNCHER!!!1[[oneoneone]]" or "WTF U SNIPED ME [[Bitch|BTCHHHHH]]!!" Here are a few of them.

*'''ASMD/Shock Rifle''': This weapon uses purple beams to push away your [[fags|enemies]] and lightweight vehicles. If you fire these at a core, BOOM HAPPENS.
*'''[[Avril Lavigne |AVRiL]]''': This poorly-named rocket launcher is good for trolling people who fly in a [[plane]]. Shoot them down and you're sure to get some [[Angry German Kid|screaming kid]] in voicechat.
*'''Assault Rifle''': The [[typical]] starting [[gun]] that can launch a grenade also.
*'''[[Poop|GES Bio Rifle]]''': GES stands for "Green Exploding [[Shit]]". It is exactly what it sounds like, also known as the cum gun. [[Srs|Really]].
*'''[[Doom|Chainsaw]]''': Only in UT. It's self-explanatory.
*'''[[Annoying|Flak Cannon]]''': The second-most overused weapon. It fires [[Piercings|hot shrapnel]] at close range. You will probably get some retard trying to fire at you from a mile away, though. [[Lol|Laugh at them]].
*'''[[Sniper|Lightning Gun]]''': [[Pikachu|Lightning]] sniping. That's it.
*'''[[Circlejerk|Link Gun]]''': This can [[Fap|boost]] your [[Homo|teammate]]'s firepower if you aim [[Dick|this]] at them.
*'''[[Pwn|Rocket Launcher]]''': The '''most fucking overused weapon of all time'''. Luckily, most users of the rocket launcher will [[self-pwn]] in time since they'll fire too close to a wall or a tree or something.
*'''[[Nuke|Redeemer]]''': [[Delete fucking everything|Destroy. Fucking. Everything.]] Extra lulz in UT1 because it has 2 shots.
*'''[[Headshot|Sniper Rifle]]''': [[Pure pwnage|BOOM HEADSHOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]]

==Mods and Skins==
Being a [[FPS]], the UT games have a lot [http://www.moddb.com/games/unreal-tournament of sites] [http://skincity.beyondunreal.com/ dedicated] [http://unrealtournament2004.filefront.com/ to modifying] the games - and of course, since it's [[Web 2.0|user-created content]], a lot of [[sick fuck]]ery and [[what]]ness happens. Furries are all over this shit, and love to make skins of their [[fursona]]s and let the [[You|public]] download them too. There's also a ton of [[animu]] skins and other [[Wtf|strange]] crap that people come up with. On the bright side, this allows you to [[Kill|frag]] furries and [[weeaboo]] things provided you also downloaded the mods and other players are using them.
