Goodnight Sweet Prince

'''Goodnight Sweet Prince''' is a line that appears [[Nobody cares|in many esteemed works of literature]] and films like Robocop. It is most notably used in the film classic ''The Big Lebowski:''


<blockquote>
 "Donny was a good bowler, and a good man. He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outdoors... and bowling, and as a surfer he explored the beaches of Southern California, from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo and... up to... Pismo. He died, like so many young men of his generation, he died before his time. In your wisdom, Lord, you took him, as you took so many bright flowering young men at Khe Sanh, at Langdok, at Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. And so would Donny. Donny, who loved bowling. And so, Theodore Donald Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your final mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well. Good night, sweet prince." ~Walter Sobchak
</blockquote>


An appearance of the phrase has also been recorded in a rightfully unknown Richard Pryor's movie called ''Brewster's millions''. The phrase appears as "Nighty-night, sweet prince" and thus possibly does not qualify to be on this page.

As a common phrase, "Good night, sweet prince" is used to [[BAW|mourn]] the death of a [[My mom just died|loved one]] who has recently passed.  As an [[internet]] [[meme]], it is used as an oft-repeated phrase on [[b|/b/]] to falsely claim somebody famous has died [[IRL]]. It no longer has any effect, since it is nearly always just a [[troll]] to send [[b|/b/tards]] off in a [[Chris Benoit|Google-frenzy]] looking for the 'death' in question. The post usually starts with a picture of the dead guy in question (always a man, since otherwise it would be "Sweet Princess," and also because [[noone]] cares when women die) with a simple line or two of text such as '''Joey Bishop, (1918-2007), Goodnight Sweet Prince.''' If the death is real and a beloved hero to [[Anonymous]] (usually somebody fucked up like [[Pol Pot]] or [[Hitler]], but sometimes an 'innocent' [[downs|downy]] water mammal such as [[Bucketseal]]) much  heartfelt discussion ensues. However, if it's just a [[troll]] (and it always is), you can bet the farm that it will be followed by 500 similar fake death notices.  Additionally, a common twist on the trolling involves purposely mislabeling the celeb in question: for instance, use a picture of David Bowie and call him Iggy Pop.
