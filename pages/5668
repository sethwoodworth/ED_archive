Then they came for the plushies, and I did not speak out, because I was not a plushie.
Then they came for the balloonies, and I did not speak out, because I was not a balloonie.
Then they came for me . . . and there was no one left to speak out for me.''|[[GreenReaper]].}}

Nazifurs are arguably the [[lulz]]iest the furry fandom has to offer - and that's fucking saying something. Goddamn furfaggots always want their fetish to be more epic than the rest of the goddamn planet. The legacy of the '''Nazi Furs''' can be traced back to Allied-occupied, post [[WW2]] [[Germany]]. With the fall of the [[Nazi]]s and the end of the [[Lollercaust]], [[Adolf Hitler]] initiated one last tactic to preserve The Third Reich before quitting IRL forever!!! The SS-Werewolves, a loose band of furries and [[otherkin]], dressed as normal, Wienerwurst-sucking Krauts in the daytime yet at night donned their fursuits and ravaged the villages in Guerrilla style [[yiff]]ing. The insurgency campaign struck the Allied troops hard but was unsuccessful in the end when a US bombing of a furry porn server left the SS-Werewolves demoralized. Even so, [[Hitler]] went to the grave knowing The SS-Werewolves would rise again to further his vision.

Sixty years later, the SS-Werewolves began regrouping under the title "Nazi Furs", a minor niche amongst the larger [[furry]] fandom. Despite the fandom's insistence on social acceptance no matter how strange or tactless the fetish, the Nazi Furs have endured conflicts with many furs who perceive the group as a threat to their furry faggotry.

In case no Furzi has realized it yet, the German verb furzen means to fart.|[http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Talk:Furzi Ya rly].}}

The Furzi are a group on [[Second Life]] who goosestep to genuine WWII Nazi Germany music every friday.

The Furzis are the most [[fursecution|fursecuted]] group in the fandom and they know it. Whenever anyone mentions that they are offended by men in [[Fursuit|fursuits]] strutting around waving flags with swastikas, the Nazifurs will immedietly launch into a soapbox speech on how they are being oppressed and have the right to free speech, thus the Nazifurs have the biggest [[victim complex]] in the entire furry fandom. Also, it is a well known fact that furzi's enjoy a bit of longshlong every now and then.


Their hypocrisy knows no bounds. They repeatedly claim that they are not a hate group and will not tolerate [[racism]]. What they do not realise is that both [[mundanes]] and [[furries]] hate them because they are so fucking dumb they parade around dressed as one of the most prejudice and hate-filled groups in history and complain that they are being denied their freedom. These idiots apparently did not graduate from the 8th grade. If they had been nazis back in WWII, they would have been sent to a concentration camp for being a bunch of mentally ill homosexuals.

==Anti-NaziFurs==
[[Image:180px-NAZI-FURS-FUCK-OFF.jpg|thumb|left|A scathing, anti-Nazifur campaign. Can't we all just get along?]]

Something has gone terribly, terribly wrong if even [[furries]] hate these guys, even more than [[Babyfurs]]. Of course, all are equally vile in [[Raptor Jesus]]'s eyes.

On March 22 2007 the Nazifurs dug themselves into an ever deeper hole when they were confronted by ''Jews of Second Life'' and ''Zionist Association of Second Life'' when one Jewish player objected to the avatar of a Nazifur. The Nazifur refused to remove it.

The drama increased when the butthurt Jew gathered his friends to try and gangrape the Nazifur. Iroically however the furfag did not have to remove his avatar because he was protected by [[free speech]]. Much [[trolling]] and [[nerd rage]] followed.

The avatar itself featured an item which had been bought from an online store named Das Waffenamt which sells Nazi paraphernalia. After so many [[BAWWW|complaints]] and trouble from the Jewish community - <b>both Jewish groups were banned from buying anything at Das Waffenamt.</b>

Folks, we can't make this [[shit]] up.

The truth is actually much more simple: Nazifurs are a weird-ass combination of the fascist fetish group and furries. The disgusting and rather disturbing result? Just look at these fucking PICTURES. Nazifurs rank high up on the furry disgusto scale- even other furries hate these fucks.

==Known Nazifurs==
[[File:Banrai Nazifursecution.PNG|thumb|350px|[[Irony|Nazifurs are among the most oppressed groups of the furry fandom]] and frequently make sure that others know about it.]]

*<b>[[Banrai]]</b>

What makes Banrai an epic source of lulz (aside from their article) is that when someone suggested they change the logo from a paw to a hat - she goes batshit and says that [[hypocrite|no groups should force another group into change their opinions or symbols]].

*<b>[[Suede Bear]]</b>

He's also a [[Babyfur]] and a [[Bakedfurs|Bakedfur]], which may explain something.

*<b>[[Biofur#Wolfegang Fox|Wolfegang Fox]]</b>

There's a reason this guys loves the Nazis - it's because he reads up on their attemps at surgery so he eventually turn himself into an animal.

*<b>[[Jax the Bat]]</b>

Who created that delightful image you see at the top of this article.
