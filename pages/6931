'''Renee Nicole Stage''', born August 1, 1986, is an [[unemployed]], 5 time dropout, and self-proclaimed [[camwhore]] from Orlando, [[Florida]] who appealed to lonely bankrollers due to her resemblance to [[Britney Spears]]. She has put [[unwarranted self-importance|every detail of her personal life]] on her blog for the past decade, even appearing on [[old media|CBS]]'s 48 Hours for a special on teen [[camwhore]]s who have shitty parents.


As an adult she is still a complete [[attention whore]] and has made a living out of asking for [[PayPal]] donations and gifts from her [[Amazon]] [[wishlists]] for sitting her lazy ass in front of her cam all day. She also Jew for people to join the non-nude "members only" section of her site, which features an array of overly [[Photoshop]]ped sideboob and crotch photos. She has been doing this for a living since she left school at [[16]] when she found out cam shows were more fun than reading and shit. Her site and cam were once pretty popular and you may have [[fapped|visited]] throughout the years as a [[pedobear|pedo]] or to read about her trainwreck life at either:

When Renee turned 18 she got [[fake tits]] and a crescent lift from a plastic surgeon at a local [[Flea Market Montgomery|mini-mall]], similar in quality to the place [[Kanye West]]'s mother went. Her tits now have a gap you can drive a [[truck]] between them and they have also resulted in her areolae becoming stretched to the size of dinner plates. Worth every penny! Not long after she opened a site named LoveRenee.com which was notorious for NEVER updating and she was labeled a scam artists. She has ruined her reputation among the non-nude [[camwhore]] circle so bad that if you google her site names you'll see a shitload of complaints from former customers and even webmaster affiliate programs that she screwed over.

==Naked Shower Video Scandal==

[[Image:Trannybitch.jpg|thumb|Why the camwhore money stopped rolling in]]


In 2006 she [[accidentally]] a video of herself getting out the shower and exposing her botched boobjob, stretched out frizbee sized areolae and all. OOPS! She forgot to edit that part out!! She was completely mortified and the video and screencaps spread all over the [[internets]]. Exhibit A:

[[Image:Chickendance.gif|LET'S ALL DANCE THE CHICKEN DANCE!]]

After this, she just decided to do the chicken dance forever.


==Ashton Von==

In 2007 Renee ditched her personal site to run only an adult themed site and created a [[scenester]] name to fit her new image "Ashton Von" (there are names like Kat Von DEE... so, Ashton Von... What? Yea, this stupid bitch didn't know what "von" meant and that it's not supposed to exist without a surname). She started describing herself as an "asshole" and a "total cuntbag" (no argument there), got a septum piercing, and began [[Amy Winehouse|getting a shitload of the stupidest fucking tattoos to fit her appearance]] that went from "surfer girl" to what she described as a "[[Suicide Girls|suicide girl]]" look. Her explanation on [[Stickam]] for trying to fit in with her new scene was literally "all my friends are known for having shitty tattoos. Shitty funny, not shitty ''shitty''. I want to get 'put out or get out' tattooed on my collar." This all took place in a year. Her tattoos include:

* the name "AC Slater"(you know, from ''Saved By The Bell'') tattooed on her right shoulder because her ex-boyfriend [[Doug]] looks like him
* one of the biggest ugliest fucking [[tramp stamp]]s known to mankind
* a lot of shitty looking flowers
* a tribute to her butchered plastic surgery that says "When All Else Fails" with a scalpel and syringe on her arm
* "PUSSY" tattooed inside her bottom lip, [[LULZ]] OMG so original & edgy
* an [[Ana|Eating Disorder]] recovery symbol dedicated to the eating disorder she never had
* and some other shit

She ditched the Ashton Von name because she couldn't keep up with typing "Ashton" instead of "Renee".

==Pregnancy==



July 2009: Renee gave birth to ugly Ava and is currently neglecting her child as we speak!

After going against doctor's orders to abort her fetus and spare it from having a fucking idiot for a mother, she [[Drunk|got pregnant]] by a [[scenester]] fag named Bryan Jeffrey Casanova (Real name: Bryan Eagle) who has the shittiest tattoos you'll ever see. He moved out of his mother's basement and into her parent's house 3 months after meeting through [[MySpace]]. He is rumored to work at [[Hot Topic]] and he also has a really fucked up wonky eye that makes him look exactly like a female version of [[Paris Hilton]]. Her baby is probably gonna be like [[Anabelle_Lotus|Anabelle Lotus]] if the baby is that lucky. She decided to name her baby Ava Frances, a perfect whore name for the child of a whore.

Although she claims she's [[Lie|engaged]] (she has no ring or wedding date of course) she says she doesn't want to get married until after she has the [[Babby|baby]] because she has no job and getting [[married]] would end her health insurance coverage via her [[Fat|obese mother]], who should use that insurance herself to get [[Die|gastric bypass surgery]]. She posted a [[blog]] saying she'd use welfare if she got married and had no insurance, instead of getting a job. When [[troll|someone]] left a comment on her [[blog]] that maybe she shouldn't be having a kid if she can't afford it, she put her blog on hiatus and posted a message saying: ''"noglorydyingold is so sick of gossip and rumors, like [[Common_knowledge|I'm a fucking idiot]] and am clueless about MY [[No_life|life]]. Lets me be [[Delusional|happy]], healthy, and go fuck yourself."''

After being told to get a fucking job when she asked her visitors to buy her a pair of $300 Juicy Couture maternity jeans she deleted her WordPress database and [[Flickr]] accounts.


==A Note from Renee's ex-friend==

[[Image:Uglycouple.jpg|thumb|Why you shouldn't procreate with a hobo]]
[[Image:BryanAvaDrunkInfants.jpg|thumb|WhyTheFuckDoYouHaveaKid.com]]

"Renee is as psychotic and fake in person as she appears online. She has NO personality whatsoever and basically copies whomever she is friends with at the time. (As you have all seemed to have noticed already).

Living with Renee was absolute hell. She didn't work. She didn't have much of an income. She bragged online on her blog that she was making thousands but in reality she was only making around $500 a month. I supported her most of the time - paid for her food, alcohol, drugs, etc...

Renee was using A LOT of drugs at the time. It is true that she used crystal meth, and used it HEAVILY. She used plenty of other drugs as well, and drank often.

Renee brought home a different guy every weekend, and had a few "miscarriages", although I didn't believe her when she claimed to be pregnant/claimed to have miscarried, because she never offered proof of her claims.

Renee is your average attention whore. She has definitely got some mental issues going on and should NOT be allowed near a child, let alone giving birth to and taking care of her own child. She is mental unstable, financially unstable, emotionally unstable, and always will be. I hope to GOD that child is taken away from her."

==Nay Quotes==

{{quote|I've putting partying behind me.}}

{{quote|[[Self-diagnosed|my doctor]] has ordered me to be home schooled because i am [[mega ultra super genius|"too smart"]] or some [[shit|ish]] like that.}}

{{quote|[[Irony|You know what I’ve never been able to comprehend]]? People who go through out their lives without absolutely no plans, no ambitions, etc. Maybe it’s not that odd of a thing, but it’s just not something that I am able to fathom. I’m not talking about taking a break from school for a year or something of that sorts, but I’m talking about having absolutely no plans for your future at all. No schooling, no job that could really supply a future, etc. I don’t think I could live that way. I think it would be a bit different if time was spent traveling and living each day to the fullest, yet never knowing where you’ll end up. Maybe that’s one thing I could do, but I just could never comprehend sitting around all day and not going to school, having a job …but nothing that could lead to higher positions, and getting wasted day in, and day out. I know so many people like that and I would be in a constant fear if I were in that situation. Maybe I’m envious that others are able to live so care free? Who knows? I just personally couldn’t live a life where there’s no outlook …I would feel lost. Scared.}}

{{quote|They had an ex-Klan member on there and said how [[not racist|he quit]] because his kid's first word was "white power." Then they showed the Nazi fuckers doing the Nazi Germany salute. Now, I'm almost half-German, but people like this are the reason I say I'm only Native American and not German.
