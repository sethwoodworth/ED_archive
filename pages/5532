Mugen
:''Note: Not to be confused with [[Car|Honda]] Mugen''

'''M.U.G.E.N.''' is the gaming phenomenon in which Marvel fanboys, Hentai lovers, and exiled [[fighting game forums|Shoryuken]] posters attempt to put gaming companies out of business by ripping off their characters and using them to make their own fighting games. In general, Mugen is like a retarded "[[Goku vs Superman|Who would win in a fight between Character X and Character Y]]" debate in video game form. Players can mash together any characters they can think of to build [[the best|the ultimatest]] dream [[crossover]] that would make even Capcom bow down to their uncontested game-making greatness.

[[DISREGARD THAT|No wait it wouldn't]], because they could respond by putting together another Street Fighter sequel made entirely of goat feces and recycled [[Powerbook]] parts and it would still play far better than any shitty Mugen compilation assembled by some animu-watching [[Gamestop]] clerk. Usually, Mugen creators are too preoccupied with fantasizing about their childhood heroes fighting together, or brainstorming ways of gaining popularity on message boards, to concern themselves with fixing any gameplay issues. The result is a giant clusterfuck of overpowered moves, infinite combos, timing flaws, and overall broken and buggy gameplay that would cause any [[tourneyfag]] to [[RAGE|die from a massive embolism]].

==History==

[[Image:Dbz-ssj5_gohan.jpg|thumb|left|Typical Mugen character]]
[[Image:9000mugenselect.png|thumb|This is probably only the 600th largest Mugen roster to date]]
[[Image:Mugen Char select.PNG|thumb|''Is that a Darkstalkers char?''<br>No [[It's a Kirby, Retard]].]]

First introduced in 1999 by [[Electric Boogaloo|Elecbyte]], the game initially served as a pity consolation for wishful-thinking Americunt gamers who have no chance of ever landing a job in the gaming business because their [[University of Phoenix|hard-earned credentials]] would be [[ror|laughed at hysterically by Shigeru Miyamoto and every other Japanese game developer]]. The prospect of being able to create custom fighting games [[basement dweller|at the comfort of your own home]] was an attractive commodity, and thus Mugen jumpstarted the [[amateur]] game development/programming industry.

Then one day, a random Mugen creator, while scribbling on his Disney coloring books, pondered what would happen if [[suicidemouse.avi|Mickey Mouse]] were to join forces with the likes of Ryu and came up with an idea for a {{youtube|5bcAn-X38UQ|new Mugen character}}. This unholy revelation led to the general conception that [[Forced Memes (Television)|anything in Mugen was possible]], and very quickly other people wanted in on the action as well. DBZ fanboys wanted to prove once and for all that Brolly is the strongest fighter in the universe, Hentai artists wanted to create nude renditions of the entire Street Fighter roster, and arcade scrubs wanted to make overpowered Shotokans in retribution for getting bitch-slapped every time in Marvel vs Capcom 2. Suddenly, Mugen went from being a complete Street Fighter clone into a broken shitpile of [[Fairly Oddparents|cartoon characters]], [[Heath Ledger|comic book heroes]], and many other [[stupid|zany]] entities shoved in.

As the community grew bigger, politics and pointless drama went on the rise and gradually overshadowed the game itself. Shitstorms about stolen characters, character critiques, and forum conflicts became a daily occurrence. The drama even overwhelmed the developers of Mugen to the point that it drove them out of the community for a good six years, leaving the fragile community into a state of [[anarchy|complete, utter chaos]].

In 2009, however, Elecbyte made its triumphant return to Mugen much to the community's delight. Unfortunately for them, the company was still reeling over the community trying to turn itself into a retard warzone over the years. To get back at them, Elecbyte announced a new version of Mugen that would render every existing character ever made completely incompatible. The mass majority predictably became distraught over these dramatic developments and [[suicide|hung themselves]] instantly, not able to bear the thought of not being able to play with their enormous collection of Mugen characters anymore.

===Story===

According to the official plot, [[Nobody cares|some karate character has a girlfriend who gets kidnapped by a never-created villain who's too suave to make an appearance]]. However if that doesn't cut the mustard for you, you can always come up with your own [[retarded|sophisticated]] storylines to accommodate your game, all of which give Mortal Kombat a run for its money. Fan-made stories include:

*A mysterious ghost of all fighting invites any and all warriors to the world of Moogaan to kick the shit out of each other like in Super Smash Bros
*The karate character from before gets his dick caught in a jar of pickles and unsuccessfully performs a series of karate moves in an attempt to remove it
*Generic fighter X fights until the game crashes
*The majority of weeaboo stories that can be seen on YouTube

===Gameplay===

[[Image:MugenHard.gif|thumb|left|[[Party Hard]] variation of Mugen, which isn't too far off from actual Mugen gameplay]]
<video type="dailymotion" id="xagnt5" width="230" height="230" desc="This'll surely win Mugen some Breakout Game of the Year awards" frame="true" position="right"/>

The objective of the game is to download as many characters you can find (while never [[molestation|touching them]] after one time) and fag up YouTube with roster videos like {{youtube|GH-lKlr1yy8|these}} containing either the Super Saiyan Evil Shin Orochi Omega Shotokan Akuma-like characters, or the rare "normal" characters people will never give a shit about. If you manage to [placeholder joke about caring about video comments], you are teh winnar!

If you're an old-school gamer, however, and don't mind the occasional [[BSOD|error message]], you can try the old-fashioned way and [[no shit|play the actual game itself]]. But you cannot play Arcade mode because [[spoiler|the ending FUCKING SUCKS]], nor can you play Versus mode because Mugen is too cheap to add [[MMORPG|online play]]. And the only winning strategy in Mugen is to piss off your opponent using as many broken tactics and exploits possible until he ragequits the match in progress, making you the winner by forfeit.

===Customization===

[[Image:Lmaomugen.png|thumb|Thanks to Mugen, players can finally witness brilliant dream matchups such as this]]
[[Image:Lmaomugen2.png|thumb|[[Brain clot|'''FUCK YOU JUSTIN WONG<br>FUCK YOU GAMERBEE<br>FUCK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!''']]]]
[[Image:Lmaomugen3.png|thumb|Give us a chance, SRK. You won't be seeing innovative possibilities like this on the real games anytime soon.]]

Creating a Mugen character is like writing [[fanfiction]] but for a video game instead of for no reason at all. It takes countless months to finish a typical character which wouldn't matter anyways because they will be thoroughly pwn3d by the advent of Super Saiyan [[Osama Bin Laden]] or an {{youtube|rwoOAUQ8Y_w|invulnerable caricature of Tom Hanks}}. The possibilities are limitless when it comes to making characters, just about anyone and anything imaginable can be created for Mugen. [[No exceptions]]. The types of characters you can create include, but are not limited to:

*Perfect conversions of existing fighting game characters, essentially making you no better than [[piracy|ROM makers]]
*Not-so perfect conversions of characters, with bugs and glitches galore (but at least [[A+++|you'll be the first one to make a Servbot for Mugen]], RIGHT???)
*Bastardized conversions of characters, with added [[noob combo|1000-hit hyper combos]] and [[headshot|one-hit-KO moves]] that will ensure an instant championship at fighting game tournaments
*[[Mary Sue|Totally original]] characters, usually manifests in the form of a recolor of Ryu or K' with lightning or fire added to make him look like the [[Sonichu|character you worked so hard to think up]]
*[[MSPaint]]-drawn characters, because you're above ripping off copyrighted games unlike [[99%]] of the community
*Pr0n females (but no pr0n males which makes fags unhappy)
*Characters with [[tentacle rape]] action to match up with said pr0n females
*3D-modeled characters so you can add all your favorite Tekken or MK: Deadly Alliance characters in Mugen
**Haha just kidding, have fun with your [[Atari|shitty 8-bit graphics and outdated 2D engine]]
*[[Nintendo|Platform games]], [[Halo|shooters]], and other innovative ideas, but honestly who even cares
*Gaming characters such as [[Mario]] and [[Sonic]], which makes you a [[furry|really sad fantard]]
*Characters from TV shows such as [[Family Guy]] and [[Futurama]], which makes you [[comic book fans|even sadder than the aforementioned above]]
*Characters from animu such as [[Naruto]] and [[Haruhi]], which makes you [[weeaboos|even sadder than both the aforementioned above combined]]
*IRL celebrities such as [[Tiger's Wood]] and [[Wacko Jacko]], with added Evil/Shin/Orochi/Omega/God powers
*Other celebrities such as [[Hitler]], who don't need God powers to [[Holocaust|pwn characters]]
*{{youtube|DVKmJDfRKXc|God Himself}}
*[[You]]
*[[Everyone]]
*[[Your mom]]

Once you've decided on which character to make, it's time to move on to the exciting creation process! And it involves only one simple step: [[final solutions|throwing your Mugen game into the Recycle Bin]]. Unless you can convince a handful of Mugen experts to put their KOF vs Kung Fu Panda ambitions on hold and make the character for you, there's no point in reading through long geekspeak tutorials about the [[shooping|Photoshop editing]] and [[Computer Science III|C++ programming]] needed to make a Mugen game yourself. Instead, you can achieve the same effect with better results and less TI-81 faggotry by playing with your [[plastic crap|action figures]].

{{quote|I play real fighters.|ED sysop [[SSCash]]|tellin' it like it is}}

It's no secret that tourneyfags and other "serious" gamers would rather get fucked in the ass with a rake than to touch Mugen with a 50-foot pole. For years, Mugenites have tried desperately to [http://shoryuken.com/f2/what-your-thoughts-mugen-238288 convince members of the Shoryuken forums to be accepting of their shitty game] but to no avail. Internet celebrities have also commented on the game, including the [http://www.fightersgeneration.com/features/mugen.html webmaster of Fighters Generation] who described Mugen as making "Marvel vs Capcom 2 seem like a [[Soul Calibur|balanced game]]." Even Capcom employee [http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2009/mar/29/capcom-pushed-double-blind-select-sf4 Seth Killian laughs in the faces of Mugen creators everywhere], when asked about his thoughts on their efforts he simply responded with, "See also: [[Trying Too Hard]]."

Despite being the [[obvious troll|obvious gaming fraud]] that Mugen is, some people have actually been gullible enough to mistake the game as a legitimate arcade/console release. Like the {{youtube|pdy3SFcwj0Y|dumbasses from G4}}, who saw a Mugen video on YouTube for the first time and [[trolled|thought it was a trailer for an upcoming upgrade of Marvel vs Capcom 2]].

Considering the legal ramifications surrounding the use of copyrighted characters, it would be a no-brainer for gaming companies such as Capcom and SNK to [[Metallica|come down hard on every Mugen user in the world and sue them all for infringement]]. But Capcom executives are too busy nowadays making [[360 Kid]] faces whenever Mugen is brought up to even take the time to engage in any kind of legal action. SNK, on the other hand, put their foot down on the usage of their characters and ordered the Mugen community to [[cease and desist]]. But before they could file lawsuits, the company went bankrupt and had gone out-of-business thus Mugen players were free to use their material in a hilarious twist of fate.

==The Mugen Community==

[[Image:Mugensite.jpg|thumb|left|Welcome to the typical Mugen creator website!]]
[[Image:Mugenserious2.jpg|thumb|Photomontage of the Mugen community, showing you that it is indeed serious business]]

As if Mugen wasn't retarded enough, its fanbase is even more of a disgrace that makes the [[GameFAQs]] Message Boards look like /v/ in comparison. Surprisingly enough, Mugen players do take some time off of their busy schedules from having mindless ecstasy for shit crossovers like Capcom vs SNK, Street Fighter vs Tekken, and [[what|Tasunokamichinokunichiwagawa]] vs Capcom. Sadly this time off never leads to anything more productive than that, as they would rather waste it all on arguing endlessly with each other over code theft, [[constructive criticism]], and anything else that is equally idiotic. Add to the fact that the majority of regulars consider themselves to be intellectuals, and it makes the entire community seem unbelievably laughable. Then again considering it's Mugen, these are the same idiots that would be happily willing to ride in one of those hilariously-designed [[Xzibit|Pimp My Ride]] mobiles in public.

===Dramatica===

The only positive aspect about the Mugen community is that anyone wishing to [[EDiting|document the drama]] surrounding it will have a gold mine on their hands. Since the Mugen community has some strange fetish with trying to compete with deviantART for Most Number of Long and Pointless Internet Sissy Fights, you can bet that there will be a multitude of Mugen drama that will keep you coming back for more. Here is a rough list of all the bitchfests you can expect to stumble upon when entering a typical Mugen forum.

[[Image:3afefe5f.jpg|thumb|How Mugen creators protect their creations]]
[[Image:Mugenrage.jpg|thumb|Typical Mugen community member]]

*Creators bitching at other creators for lifting material such as sprites and sounds from their characters and using it with their own characters (first person to point out the irony is this statement wins [[internets|three Mugen communities]])
*Creators bitching whenever their stuff gets uploaded to warehouses and [[Rapidshit]], because now people can go elsewhere to get their characters and not have to go through pages of the creator's [[Geoshities]] site talking about himself
*Creators handing out his private characters to thirty of his VIP buddies, only to have them come up in an eSnips search three days later
*Closed-source vs. Open-source debates, with one side thinking [[unrealistic expectations|they have the power to control their creations on the Internet]] and the other thinking [[unrealistic expectations|they have the power to save the Mugen community from unbridled insanity]]
*Posters complaining about getting character requests in their inbox and posting five-page topics about it on Mugen forums because [[Jake Roberts|it's really, really worth it]]
*Posters bitching at [[you]] for being a leecher and not contributing anything to Mugen and the community
*Creators cutting themselves over constructive criticism on their characters, ignoring the fact that they have as much coding/spriting skills as [[contradiction|Mac users have computer skills]]
*Feedbackers whining about [[SNCA|infinites, .0000000000000001 timing inaccuracies, or wrong hit priorities]] as if Mugen was even a tournament-worthy game to begin with
*Posters bitching about creators not listening to feedback on their characters because they're "ruining the good name of Mugen" on the Shoryuken forums
*Posters calling Mugen a game and having ten others jumping at him for not properly calling it a game '''ENGINE'''
*Posters yelling at newbies to read the Mugen [[docs]] whenever they post a question in the Help forum
*Posters being outraged whenever someone sells a Mugen game on eBay or compiles an [[7 passwords|illegal hack]] of the Mugen engine itself
*Posters complaining about people not updating their Mugen versions (yes folks, this is as bad as it gets)
*Posters debating with each other ferociously over the true acronym for M.U.G.E.N.
*Posters pestering Elecbyte about porting Mugen to [[Xbawks|game consoles]], despite that nobody would ever pay a cent to touch its horrible gameplay
*Creators complaining about their characters getting beat up in YouTube videos
*Posters complaining about various moderator misdeeds and demanding them to be demodded, in return nominating their IRC buddies as qualified replacements
*Male posters with [[GOTIS]] pretending to have PMS whenever [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/5/50/Liesrskf.JPG people provide evidence] showing that the supposed female Mugen player does have in fact a [[small cock]]
*Posters lynching another poster for mentioning Street Fighter Online (SFO), a slightly-more superior game to Mugen
*Posters complaining about [[ED]], so much that they would rather document up-to-date community drama on the [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MUGEN TV Tropes Mugen article] instead

===The Big Dogs of Mugen===

[[Image:Randomselect2.jpg|thumb|The RandomSelect gang, in all their wonderful glory. Quick! Turn away from this pic now or else you'll think lowly of Godly Mugen forum poster ShoShingo!]]
[[Image:Randomselectv2.jpg|thumb|Vastly improved version of the above pic, courtesy of RandomSelect themselves. Note the ample amount of Uncyclopedia in the middle panel.]]

If you want to pinpoint the primary reason why the Mugen community is the colossal joke that it is today, look no further than the approval-seeking, whitenoise protestfags known as '''[http://randomselect.piiym-net.com RandomSelect]'''. Like every glory troll and poser Anon on the Internet, their aim is to represent the community as the token fan-favorite idiot-bashing Mugen group by leeching off the legacy of a defunct Mugen [[trolling organization]] once known as [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/6/6e/MRev.jpg MRev]. Apparently, this means assembling an army of [[Internet detective]]s and going on Internet crusades yelling at n00bs about community ethics, "competitive" gaming standards, and other moronic lost causes. Some of their most common trollie antics include:

*Raiding forums and hijacking topics about stolen Mugen characters, moderator misdeeds, or anything that might displease some Shoryuken fag
*Flaunting [http://randomselect.piiym-net.com/forum/index.php?topic=1652.msg22073#msg22073 screenshots and videos of their private characters] that nobody will ever have, a troll which most certainly [http://randomselect.piiym-net.com/forum/index.php?topic=3217.0 never backfires]
*Writing angry Mugen character [http://randomselect.smeenet.org/ddm/e-hugo.html reviews] and [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/6/6d/JesuszillegatoB.jpg critiques] showing you that like in [[ED IRC]], you'll need to don your [[thick skin|thickest skin]] before stepping foot into the ruthless Mugen communihahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!
*Constantly interrogating posters about proving their points or how they're dodging the issue to reaffirm their [[:File:Emot-words.gif|unrivaled Internet argument skills]]
*Ranting about the ego trips and USIs of others, all while plugging their shitty "[[trying too hard|non-conformist]]" characters, advertising their annual Mugen awards that nobody cares about, mass-voting for themselves in every popularity contest, namedropping ancient Mugen personalities they've had no prior history with, and pretending to be an Elecbyte employee
*Throwing a hissy fit whenever people prevent them from using their user name, because God forbid people can't recognize a real Mugen superstar when they see one!
*Posting phrases such as ''cupcake'', ''comedy gold'', and ''Ahaha'', all while having the post histories of former MRev members open on another browser
*Replying with hilariously wacky troll responses such as {{youtube|LLWKNSoQM7c|this}} (oh, those rascally Mugen kids and their [[Unfunnypedia|randomy randomness]]!)
*Blaming the revelations of their hypocrisy and stupidity on an ex-MRev idol's [[LMAO|mood swings]]
*Making the occasional [[flounce]] post whenever [[butthurt|faced with adversity]] and claiming to retire from the Mugen community forever, only to miraculously return months later when they feel people are anxiously begging for their return despite that [[nobody cares]]

My my, what a scary bunch of Capcom-pirating badasses we got here right guys?! Sadly, because the Mugen community is made up of simpletons who get easily impressed by any zero-trick pony trying to imitate [[Seanbaby]], RandomSelect garners a large cuddle crew of fanboys and sympathizers alike who wildly mark out every time a member whines about a Mugen character and mimic their actions at every chance they get. As a result, more than half of the entire Mugen community nowadays consists of delusional dramamongers sharing the twisted belief that A) [[herp|computer files can be regulated on the Internet]], and B) [[derp|"balanced" gameplay can be achieved on a broken shitpile like Mugen]] that will finally enable the Mugen forums to be molded into that highly coveted SRK-like environment.

===Community Ethics===

The only thing more sizable than a single Mugen creator's massive ego is the long list of do's and don'ts (mostly don'ts) thought up by pretend admins wanting to [[cyberpolice|control and manipulate the handling of Mugen characters on the Internet]]. The Mugen community has a very strict policy when it comes to how Mugen characters should be treated and [[Taking down ED|will do everything in their power]] to make sure that you, the regular Mugen user, aren't committing any crimes against [[e-penis|creator]] [[blowjob|respect]]. ''Wait, rules? Ethics? Aren't they already committing a bigger crime by stealing from gaming companies to begin with?'' Silly goose, you should know by now that there's no such thing as logic and intelligence in the Mugen community! Here is a complete list of these rules in which everyone must abide by in order to avoid being hassled by MRev fanboys and other armchair Mugen contributors still clinging on to the 2003-era of Mugen. '''EDITOR'S NOTE''': This list is not fabricated nor exaggerated in any way to make this list seem more ridiculous than it really is. This one's the real deal!

[[Image:laxxefuckedanim.gif|thumb|Community ethics fag/Creator permission [[Rule 34]]]]

#Do not host or upload characters anywhere, that includes your Angelfire webspace, e-mail, Rapidshare, and [[Archive.org]].
#Do not modify characters without the creator's permission, even if they are no longer active in the scene or even [[RIP|alive]].
#Do not request characters, and do not inquire about characters you see on select screens posted by people who demand that you not request said characters.
#Do not reveal links to characters found on public webpages, this is what is considered to be "[[pee|leaking of private material]]".
#Do not create patches for characters, including AI patches, palette packs, and DOS patches.
#[[LMAO|Do not release open-source sprite packs, and do not reveal the methods of ripping from certain games]].
#Do not report character releases on news sites or message boards.
#Do not post screenshots and YouTube videos of characters.
#Do not ask for old versions of characters.
#Repeat rules 1-9, only replace [[Butthurt|''the offended creator'']] with [[Butthurt|''the offended spokesperson of the creator'']].

Failure to comply with any of these rules will result in the [[MURDER|killing of Mugen]], multiple statements from creators of quitting, knee-jerk closings of creator sites and databases, 700-page shitstorm threads, and a vast quantity of ShoShingo-homage posts from [[newfags]] such as Kung Fu Man, Byakko, Hoshi, TMasta, and MachinaWeapon.

If you've come this far and still question the level of stupidity in the Mugen community, then this section will certainly put those doubts to rest. Here you will find a decade's worth of Mugen drama enough to make Baby Jesus asphyxiate himself, and unsurprisingly Kung Fu Man and RandomSelect have been involved in the majority of the whinefests. Below is a comprehensive list of events where the length alone pretty much sums up the retardation of the Mugen community in a nutshell.

<div class="archive">
*[http://charasoon.yuku.com/topic/462/t/Dragon-Zamasu-Released.html An iconic flamewar from 2002 between MRev and legendary Mugen public enemy GohanSSM2, setting the bar for Mugen drama in the years to come. To this day, Mugen community members still look to this topic for inspiration and attempt to emulate this event on Mugen forums three times daily.]

*[http://shoryuken.com/f2/mugen-head-ctrl-alt-del-reimix-ready-download-111137 The only thing worse than trying to sway the opinions of Shoryuken posters about Mugen is trying to enforce Mugen community ethics on their own forum.]

*[http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/d/dc/Mugensiteclosings.jpg Kung Fu Man tries to rally every Mugen creator into going private and closing down their sites in protest against warehousing, a flounce that would last only a few days to no one's surprise.]

*[http://shoryuken.com/f2/serious-mugen-full-game-no-really-242591 In all seriousness, it's pretty stupid for someone from the Mugen community to try and shove their Mugen game down the collective throats of the SRK forums. It's not like anyone from the well-respected RandomSelect cuddle crew would ever do such a thing. NOPE.]
*[http://mugenguild.com/forumx/index.php?topic=117213.0 Backtracking at its finest: RandomSelect suddenly decide they're OK with the warehousing of other people's characters and even engage in some warehousing of their own. Can't be because they're watching over a certain ED article now would it?]

*[http://mugenguild.com/forumx/index.php?topic=120132.0 RandomSelect ran out of things to complain about, so they decide to grandstand about people using old versions of the Mugen engine. Oh gosh darnit, isn't there anything that can make these lovable badasses happy?!]

|Seriously, either get yourself a brain and look up "respect", "community", "ethic", "common sense" and "logic" in your favourite dictionnary or you'll get mauled down in most communities that have some kind of common sense.

|Well while you were busy compiling rips of these games, I was busy playing the real thing. And i'm just going to say that a game is more than just the characters/stages/music/presentation. Just because you can fit your rips into MUGEN's engine doesn't mean you've recreated a game. It just means you wasted an assload of time.|A Shoryuken poster's thoughts on Mugen
|Unfortunately, most people on it are fanboy scrubs who're out to fulfill their fantasies or are unable to play to win and would rather try to prove that they can do a better version of their favorite character rather than learn to win with them.|Another brutal reality check delivered by SRK

|Here's a flaw with your logic there cupcake: she didn't "release it for mugen". It has next to nothing to do with mugen or the mugen community. It can't be modified, can't have parts used in other games, and so forth. For all intents and purposes it's a beta of a game that maybe, just maybe, she didn't want to be tossed into the shitstorm of this community so some dumb shit could ask "how do I break it apart" or even better call her "plain fucking stupid" because they weren't invited to the party.

Real. Fucking. Audacity.|ROARORAOROAH LOOK HOW ANGRY KUNG FU MAN IS, THAT MREV MEMBERSHIP IS ONLY INCHES AWAY
|This is fucking stupid.

No, really, it is. Basically one shit can go on and ravage other works freely, justify it countless ways, and there's nothing that can be done but to keep railing on him until he relents. Isn't that something special.

Guild's staff won't do anything but snicker at all of this. And yes, you better believe many of them are. The people that decided for this change in the way this corner of the community had little stake if it failed, a few even outright admit that much. Valodim and DreamSlayer have made nothing, Sepp never cared about his work in the first place, and so forth. The rest of the staff is either here for the power and/or "prestige" the title should bring, or just doesn't give a shit and tries to keep things afloat.

In other words we the individual don't matter. It's all about the open sources, about their vision. And what do we patronize them with? We give them our wip threads, and our posts, and tell them we'll accept their bullshit here, just because they're too damn big to ignore. We swallow it because it has people, but in effect we're the underlying grease that keeps their engine going. And if more of us had guts we'd say to hell with a place that did nothing but shit in our faces while we compliment them on the smell.

This is never going to change. This guy is going to fall back on the rules that give him a privilege, no, a right to do this to people. We as creators have had our Icarus moment. And I've had enough.|A typical Kung Fu Man post flouncing off from Mugen Guild forever<br>'''NOTE''': Post history shows [[LMAO|normal posting resumed 48 hours later]]
|Yamazaki Hashimoto the fictional character is copyright myself, RandomSelect and subsequently the I-XCell network, even if it uses KY sprites for the mugen incarnation (the final character is not what was included in the original demonstration game). As is and given recent events with Eternaga and Blaque and a conflict of interests, I wish to reserve my legal right as sole distributor of renditions and merchandise of this character until a time in the future as I do see fit.

Bet you didn't know you could do that did you?|Kung Fu Man pretending to be a legal expert
|Ash: It isn't that easy to win. diz: so what's the deal with hosting the version of winmugen Sion and I hacked?<br>
Paul Potts diz: winmugen's been through so many copyright violations and hacks that i thought it turned no-man's land<br>
Ash: It isn't that easy to win. diz: Could I just respectfully ask that WM Plus not be hosted then?<br>
Ash: It isn't that easy to win. diz: I get the copyright argument and everything, just if Guild's going to throw me out I'd rather they not take my work too.<br>
Ash: It isn't that easy to win. diz: That's a reasonable request, no?|For someone that's strongly against hacking the Mugen engine and claiming it as his own, Kung Fu Man sure doesn't mind doing it himself
|And if you whine and go "oh you came back lol"...seriously fuck off. I opted to release some nice things because I wanted to play around with mugen a little more. You want to go scurrying like a roach to ED or wherever and whine about it, feel free to.|HURR HURR HURR I WANNA BE LIKE SHOSHINGO AND JOIN MREV BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE ED IS MAKING FUN OF ME
|it's pretty clear kfm doesn't put a single ounce of thought into anything he types.  he just says whatever he thinks sounds good (and since he is mentally deficient it never sounds good to anyone but him and people with similar retardation problems), and that's why he's constantly contradicting himself or putting his foot in his mouth.  i mean, kfm ripping on people for "over-reacting" to something???  seriously???

also, i want to go on record and state that if he really wants noteriety (as it is so painfully obvious the case), then he should spend all the time he spends on forums screaming about other people's characters and watching over the wikipedia article to make sure that nothing goes against Kung Fu Ethics and focus on actually making something good for MUGEN.|At least one MRev associate isn't completely fooled
