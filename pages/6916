'''RejectedDreams''' is a [[Bible Thumper|Bible-thumping]] [[devianTART|Tartlet]] [[Christian]] who acts like he's [[God]]'s [[bullshit|messenger]] and thinks he can predict the future for non-Christian people. He almost takes the entire Bible literally such as Noah's ark and the very lie of the [[No|world being 6000 years old]]. If he was a real Christian, he would drink a bottle of bleach because of Mark 16:18. His idea of [[God]], will [[e-go|send anyone]] who doesn't follow the rules of the [[Jesus]] fan club to [[Satan|hell]]. He does not like being called a "[[fundamentalist|fundie]]" or "[[cock|prick]]", which makes sense because most pricks do not like that term.

He is also interested in [[bestiality|cat]]s and [[Furfag|Lola Bunny]], thus making him a [[Christian furry]]. All cats are ashamed of him, and want nothing to do with his constant [[faggotry]]. He also claims that he is a 20-year old or over due to the fact that he admitted that he was "pre-[[Nintendo]]". He has not responded to any mentions of his article, preventing lulz from occurring, however after the amount of people flaming him he started "trollin' back". By trolling, we mean him using the n00b language but in a crude way and saying "I don't give a rat's ass". Like his pwning skillz and his understanding of the Bible, he fails hard when trolling. By those results, that means that he <s>might be</s> '''IS''' some sort of Christian [[Internet Tough Guy]], much like that [[DBoyWheeler|the other one]].

== A Real Reject ==
[[Image:Not phobic stamp by Rynnay.gif|thumb|left|120px|Despite being liked by RD, this stamp can't apply to him for he both hates [[bullshit|BS]] [[ship]]s AND is [[homophobia|homophobic]].]]
[[Image:Stfupope.jpg|thumb|RejectedDreams is one of [[DBoyWheeler|several]] [[PilgrimJohn|people]] the [[Pope]] thinks should stop using the [[Bible]] to sound [[stupid|smart]] with.]]
[[Image:RDAssKissing.PNG|thumb|left|120px|RejectedDreams getting ass kissings by E-friends. (E-friends are, of course, his ONLY friends)]]
[[Image:Ibelievesit.png|thumb|RD in a nutshell.]]

All the friends of RejectedDreams (more like RejectAtLife, [[amirite]]?) are [[conservatism|conservative]] [[fundamentalist|Christian]]s, some of whom packed their bags and left deviantART. His best E-friends (but not [[homosexuality|butt buddies]], for the following two are female) are {{deviantart|Netbug009|Netbug009}} and [[Xiao-Feng-Fury]], who suck off on all of his work and defend his no-minded bigotry if somebody dares to criticize or even question his Sizzler's quality cafeteria Christianity.

Another of his best friends is {{deviantart|hiphopqueen333|hiphopqueen333}}. She is as obsessed with [[rap]] music as she is with Christianity. She constantly [[Incontinent Student Bodies|BAWW]]s about being made fun of for being a conservative Christian, ignoring the fact she refuses to accept other views and is friends with bigots. She also abuses deviantART's [[glomp|hug]] icon, for it can be seen in over 80% of her posts. Nothing would make her happier than knowing that she is being persecuted 4 HURRR BELEIFZXZ10101, so feel free to sign onto DA and shit all over her "art".

Others who RejectedDreams gets along with:

* [[DBoyWheeler]]: He doesn't talk with RD much. However, DBoy did positively comment on one of RD's pictures, [[:Image:MegaManJesus.PNG|said comment comparing]] Christianity to ''[[Megaman]]'' games.

* {{deviantart|Erix19|Erix19}}: [[wolfaboo|Fan of wolves]] and Jesus. Along with Reject, he thinks that the [[George Washington|Founding Fathers]] [[lie|founded the USA on Christianity]] and thinks that they would be disappointed in today. You're sort of right, Erix. They (especially [[Ayn Rand|Jefferson]]) didn't like the [[fundamentalist|fundie]] ideas of USA, so [[HA! HA! Guy|they'd be quite disappointed]] in [[stupid|YOU]] and [[retard|your kind]]. 

* [[ethereal-crow]]: LOL NEVERMIND! Update: even ethereal-crow thinks RD is a bigot. Apparently he posted a journal where he was like, "I'm tired of arguing with people, so I think I'll lay it off; trolls are so annoying," BLAH BLAH BLAH BUTTHURT or something like that. And she totally called him out for being a douche, saying that it was ''his'' fault the trolls kept bothering him -- and, of course, he totally ignored her. According to her: "He brought the trolls upon himself by being so uncouth and blatantly disregarding the fact that we should all -respect- each other. I stopped watching him a while ago because he needs to learn some social standards first." NOW ALL HIS JOURNALS ARE APPARENTLY BALEETED LOL.

* {{deviantart|LeviFoxtrot|LeviFoxtrot}}: Told to RejectedDreams that [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/4586804/830097917 he should move to another country to preach], as Levi thinks that [[John Hagee|America is doomed]]. It is recommended that the place for Reject, Levi, and the other fundies to move to is [[Afghanistan]], or any other high-danger area.

* {{deviantart|ServantofJesus|ServantofJesus}}: The name explains him well, especially when you consider that he thinks of Christianity as a [[homosexuality|relationship with God]]. He also thinks that [[9/11|bad things happen]] due to sin. Jesus fired him from his sweet crib years ago but Servant here has yet to move on with his E-life.

* {{deviantart|Shao-Feng-Li|Shao-Feng-Li}}: A "''[[Star Wars]]''-obsessed [[fundamentalist|fundie]]", as she's described herself. At least she'll admit she's a fundie! She broke [[Godwin's Law]] by [[:Image:Holocaust by Shao Feng Li.gif|comparing abortion to the Holocaust via stamp]], said stamp having been added to RD's favorites. Unlike the other fundies, she actually does have common sense elsewhere, as she doesn't like the [[shitty art|shitty works]] she sees on and uploads to {{ljcomm|deviantartsnark}}.

* {{deviantart|SuperGrouper|SuperGrouper}}: She is so [[butthurt]] by ED to the point where she [[:Image:ED cant breed LOL WUT.gif|made a stamp]] expressing said butthurt feelings. She is [[BFF]]s with most of the people who are mentioned in this section. If you do not like what she has to say, you can "[http://supergrouper.deviantart.com/art/Rights-Stamp-75856635 Move to] [[Terrorism|Saudi Arabia]]" which is how she ends all her comment banned "artworks". Her faith in Christ is so weak she cannot stand to be questioned.

[[Image:RejectedDreamsStyleGandhiVSFalwell.jpg|thumb|right|250px|RejectedDreams-style statistics on [[India|Gandhi]] and [[Jerry Falwell]]. Don't make the mistake Gandhi made of being non-Christian!]]

His [http://rejecteddreams.deviantart.com/favourites/ favorite works by others] are mostly [[Jesus]] [[shit]] and stamps supporting views such as [[butthurt|hate]] of [[porn]], [[homophobia]] including BAWWing about [[rainbow blinkies|rainbows]] representing [[homosexuality]] (ironically, [[hypocrite|he also included]] a [[lie|"not a homophobe"]] stamp as part of his favorites), [[Chris Crocker|leaving his fundie friends alone]], and, at least one reasonable one: Anti-[[Wapanese]].

===Quick!! Hide everything!!===

On October 15, 2008, RejectedFailure ([[amirite]]?) decided that he just couldn't take all the haters who pointed out to him that his beliefs are nothing but [[lies|bigoted shit]]. He has decided to pull a [[Snapesnogger]] and hide [[fucking]] everything, thinking it'll make his problems go away. Obviously he's feeling the heat of the mighty ED. Every deviant comment has been hidden. Yes, all 56 pages of them. And all the comments on his journals are hidden. And what a shocker! Comments are disabled on deviations, too! Apparently he sees just how fast the screenshots go up and he doesn't want to give ED more ammunition. Foolish little [[tartlet]]. He is still on however, for he'll hide any new comments on his page, and also continues to fav stamps about his [[Jesus|lover]]... [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, HE'S BACK]]

As of October 18, it is confirmed that RejectedFailure is still active on deviantART, as his comments are on Xiao-Feng-Fury's page, with the date of October 17th on them. Not surprisingly, he is encouraging XFF to once again exercise their hatred against the gheys and [[:Category:People|other people they don't like]]. Instantly afterwords, Reject unhid the comments on his page, save for the ones by himself.

== Arguing, RejectedDreams Style ==

[[Image:RDGodFetish.PNG|thumb|left|250px|From just a quick look at his profile, it is already obvious that RejectedDreams has a [[God]] [[fetish]].]]

[[Image:RDORLY.JPG|thumb|So now he thinks he's above everyone else who isn't Christian. Way to go RejectedShit.]]

Despite living in the 21st century, his views are stuck [[At least 100 years ago|in the past]]. [[Shit nobody cares about|Bible passages]] supply his arguments. If someone dares to use [[logic]] against his Bible [[stupid|wisdom]], his reaction will be one of two things: He'll either respond with his usual Biblical argument, or [[coward|not respond]] to the easily superior argument. Or just ban you for making sense. Reject is incapable of reading a graph; be sure to point this out. Additionally, despite using the Bible as his basis for arguments, when someone else uses it against him, he accuses those acts as "word twisting".

He also shoves his [[homosexuality|dong]] of [[Jesus]] down people's throats, claiming that if you don't [[Dying alone|dedicate your entire life to him]], you will never be in [[heaven]]! Considering that this idea of Heaven would be full of the likes of RejectedDreams and [[Jerry Falwell]], Hell seems appealing in comparison. RejectedDreams also bears a similarity to the likes of Falwell, [[Pat Robertson]], and [[Billo The Clown|Bill O'Reilly]] in the fact that he both distances himself from and speaks against [[God hates fags|Fred Phelps]] to appear less bigoted, even though deep down he probably thinks Fred is among the most likely to get into Heaven.

== Ways of Pissing Off RejectedDreams ==

[[Image:ListofWhatRDWontAccept.PNG|thumb|250px|[[Irony|His mood is "caring" in this journal]]...[[LOL WUT]]]]

These evil, satanic behaviors are NOT acceptable!

* Thinking that there is at least one flaw in the Bible. It is God's word, therefore, it is perfect!
* Believe in lies of [[science]], such as [[evolution]] and [[truth|the thought that humans are animals]].
* Be supportive of [[homosexuality|gays]]. Do NOT support sinful behavior!
* Celebrate the evil, anti-Christian Halloween.
* Read [[Harry Potter]], or anything else with witchcraft portrayed in a positive light.
* Believe in ghosts or reincarnation.
* Ask him if he thinks bats are birds or if insects have four legs.
* Ask him to read a graph.
* Believing that he's a hypocrite and use his cherished bible to point out the obvious.

However, you can still be saved by [[Jesus]]! But if at least one of the following things applies to you, it will result in a one-way trip to hell:

* Be part of any non-Christianity religion.
* Be [[agnosticism|agnostic]] or [[atheist]].
* Be [[homosexuality|gay]]. (According to RD, living a gay lifestyle means you [[stupid|cannot be Christian]]) Which is silly because all Christians are fags. Intellectual checkmate!
* Be [[abortion|pro-choice]]. [[Lie|You CANNOT be both pro-choice and Christian!]]
* Have a [[brain]] and [[common knowledge|common sense]].

== Getting to Heaven according to RejectedDreams ==

[[Image:FeelGoodGospel.PNG|thumb|250px|Progressive Christianity is not Christianity, we must not tolerate things that go against the Bible! See also: [http://theboredintellectual.deviantart.com/art/Have-I-got-a-deal-for-you-O-98278406 This parody which is much smarter than RD's views will ever be.]]]

For starters, you have to be a Christian. Only real, biblical Christianity counts, none of this Progressive Christianity with the [[masturbation|feel good]] gospel! You should also read the entire Bible word by word, and accept it as the complete truth. Screw [[science]], [[Earth]] being millions of years old is a lie, just like the Big Bang! While you may seem to act like you enjoy the concept, do NOT have [[secks]] with the Bible.

Thank God for everything (especially the cash you earned yourself), and worship Him (do NOT refer to Him as "him"! [[E-go|It pisses him off!]]) 24/7. But doing this alone is still not enough. You need to preach about God's word to EVERYONE, yes, everyone. You can preach anywhere, RejectedDreams himself is a [[DeviantART]] evangelist. And you must preach the truth as it is said in the Bible!

Note that God is all-loving, <i>but</i> [[hypocrite|He will send you to <i>hell</i> if you do something unforgivable, like being gay]]! Yet, it should also be said that the [[God hates fags]] concept is also wrong. God does NOT hate fags - fags have a lifestyle that defies Him and the Bible, thus, they will be punished with hell for all eternity. But He doesn't hate them. Likewise, God does not hate Jews/Mormons/Buddhists/Muslims/Agnostics/Atheists, but He will also punish the heathens with hell!

Overall, warn everyone about their sins, and how they'll be doomed to hell unless they are both straight and the fundie type of Christian! [[DO IT FAGGOT|DO IT]]. (unless you want to go to hell!)

== Galleries ==

=== RejectedDreams' Work ===

RejectedDreams' gallery primarily consists of photography and religious [[bullshit]].

{{cg|The Gallery|RDShit|center|<gallery>

==== Journal of Win ====

In January of 2008, a Tartlet named {{deviantart|Spleef|Spleef}} wrote a [http://spleef.deviantart.com/journal/16461183/ journal] proving how much RejectedDreams [[fail]]s. Although via the journal, the whole debate (in other words, Spleef [[pwnt|pwning]] RD) can be seen, the image below is perhaps the best example of why RD can't debate:

== He Writes, Too! ==

=== A Testimony Of Bullshit ===
[[Image:OhNOESXiaoFengFury.jpg|right|thumb|Despite being a lie either way, Xiao being the writer would just increase the lies of this piece tenfold.]]

[http://rejecteddreams.deviantart.com/art/A-Testimony-Of-Hope-74639562 A Testimony of Hope] is in RejectedDreams' gallery. The work is [[TL;DR]] and [[plagiarism|not written by him]], due to the mentioning of the writer being a former [[lesbian]]. (possibly the lesbian faker [[Xiao-Feng-Fury]]?) The summary: A Tartlet female who had been a lesbian due to being exposed to [[NSFW|R-rated]] [[porn|content]] from a young age, but got saved from Satan's evil work of homosexuality by ([[common knowledge|you guessed it]]) Jesus! The comments appeared to have been worse than usual on a RejectedDreams piece, for he had to disable comments. But what comments were there [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/74639562/ can still be seen].

RejectedDreams had lied (thus going against [[Bible|the Ten Commandments]]) by [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/74639562/630386705 saying he did not hate gays], [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/74639562/630932389 thinks that not shoving his bullshit down peoples' throats would be betraying his God], and [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/74639562/630124836 denies that the work is hateful]. But this quote is perhaps the most [[creepy|disturbing]]:

{{quote|It doesn't matter how 'nice' you are or what great and wonderful things you do for others-that does not get you eternal life(and the escape from Hell).|RejectedDreams}}

=== Evil Evolution! ===

[[Image:Evovovo.jpg|right|thumb|All of these are [[lie]]s!]]

The second written "piece" in RejectedDreams' gallery is [http://rejecteddreams.deviantart.com/art/Evolution-Proven-Wrong-Again-76150951 Evolution:Proven Wrong Again]. In it, a fictional [[History Teacher-kun|teacher]] teaches the evil lie of [[evolution]] to young [[student]]s. Later that day, she gets into a [[car]] crash and [[death|dies]]. Despite being a nice person, she joins [[Evolution|Charles Darwin]] and others in hell for teaching the Satanic lie of evolution. [[WTF|Being created by an invisible being]] is so the truth!

As if the concept wasn't shit on his own, it also proves that RejectedDreams can't write. His vocabulary is a combination of the words a [[13-year-old boy|5-year-old]] knows about and any word in the Bible, thus making him do poorly at making descriptions. Additionally, whenever a character speaks, a new paragraph starts.

RejectedDreams, once again, states that [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/76150951/643575245 not being a threatening asshole would betray his God], even though being one gives rational Christians a bad name. He also [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/76150951/796036391 refuses to admit] that [[God]] is [[butthurt]], and admits to being a [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/76150951/644635595 fan] of [[Chick tracts|Jack Chick]]. (not exactly surprising, especially when you consider how similar the story is to a [[Chick tracts|Chick tract]])

=== Satan's Plan ===

[[Image:RejectedDreamsJournal1.PNG|thumb|200px|The original journal.]]

The third of RejectedDreams' [[shit|works]] is [http://rejecteddreams.deviantart.com/art/The-Progress-Report-99810975 The Progress Report]. He had it in his journal at first, but just recently uploaded it as a writing. This time, it is about [[Satan]] getting a progress report on all the evils that Hell has spread to Earth. Examples of these are:

* The occurrence of [[abortion]].
* The [[fat|large]] amount of [[porn]] in [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|America]].
* The fact that there are people who are [[homosexuality|homosexual]].
* The practice of [[Wicca]] and [[Harry Potter|witchcraft]].
* [[Common knowledge|Thinking that]] being a [[pretty cool guy|good person]] is more important than one's religion when it comes to going to [[Heaven]].
* Following the likes of [[crystal ball|astrology]] and [[shit nobody cares about|horoscopes]].
* Being a part of a [[evil|Satanic]] religion. (in other words, anything besides Christianity)

Reject then ends the story with saying that [[Over 9000|many]] people die without [[Jesus]] as their [[homosexuality|lover]], and then join Satan in the torments of hell. Unless a fundie dies on that day, it is assumed that [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100%]] of Christians who die during a day go to hell. Of course, this story is really just proof that fundies enjoy blaming Satan on everything that they don't like.

After a small amount of comments, this was the first thing [[coward|Reject]] [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|disabled and hid comments on]]. For somebody who expresses his views so much, he sure can't stand hearing others' opinions.

A tArtlet named Kieranfoy pwn't him so badly in a reply that his children's children will wake up one night and say "WoW! WTF just pwn't me?" 

http://kieranfoy.deviantart.com/art/The-Screwtape-Report-113113724

== Entrance of the Anti-Christ ==

After years of somebody [[W|Reject approved of]], [[Senator Barack Hussein Obama|Barack Obama]] got elected President on November 4th. While [[liberalism|libtards]] such as [[Adf-fuensalida]] fapped, it was a very dark day for Reject. He lost even MORE faith in America, but this is only faith in AMERICA he lost: Due to the election of EBIL SATAN OBAHMA, [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/4586804/880926365 REJEKT'S FAYETH STRENTHEND!!!] Additionally, he got something to fap to as [[Homophobia|Proposition 8]] got passed, thus making [[homosexuality|gay]] [[marriage]] no longer allowed in [[California]].

But nonetheless, Reject feels the end is near, as Obama MUST be T3H ANTI-CHRIST!!![[oneoneone|111]] Reject thinks that his one-way ticket to heaven has been [[protect fucking everything|secured]] even further due to his rejection of the Anti-Christ. Others who have his ticket are [[Xiao-Feng-Fury|Xiao]], [[DBoyWheeler|DBoy]], [[Chick tracts|Jack Chick]], and a few more, thus making that small group the only ones going to Heaven while everyone else burns in hell: Boy, God really is loving according to Reject, isn't he? Of course, not being with fundies isn't much of a threat.

==His Brain Got Broked???==

[[image:SnarkyRD.png|thumb|right|Babble sez no cursing!!1 It be a sin!]]
On November 11, 2008, after getting pwned so many times by anyone with a brain, it appears that RejectedDreams has finally [[insane|snapped]]. His behavior now consists of slinging around insults and going LALALALALALAALAL I CAN'T HEAR U!!!!!111!!!!one! and failed attempts at trolling back. It can be logically concluded that RD now no longer wishes to leave himself open to [[pwnage]] by trying to debate and force his [[creationism|close-minded beliefs]] on others, so he will no longer answer questions about his religion, even polite ones. In fact, their has been a huge difference between his DevianTART page of now than the one before this article was created.

*He had the great [[Jesus|Jeebus]] fish as his icon.
**Now has dancing cat.
*Quoted the Bible.
**Now acts like a wanabe-badass.
*Faved a bunch of religous stamps such as anti-gay stamps, anti-atheists and much more bigotry.
**Now faves cats.
*His information box said that God was his favorite artist.
**Replaced his info box with lyrics from a crappy song.

This has appeared to stop, though, because he's talking more Bible shit again.

== Reject is going to hell! ==

[[Image:Rdwizard.jpg|center]]

You read this correctly. RejectedDolt had used [[Nostradamus]] as a source, which goes against his FAYTH. This has brought damage to his one-way ticket to heaven, and may mean he's going to hell.

==Moar Christfaggotry==

[[Image:Truth by RejectedDreams.jpg|right|thumb|Just when you thought it was over.]]

This spring of 2009, he posted a journal (now baleeted) about how he wasn't going to talk about the [[Bible]] any moar, and posted his photography instead. However, as made clear by this [http://rejecteddreams.deviantart.com/art/Truth-132049168 shitty stamp] submitted August 3, 2009, he is back to his bible-thumping Christfaggotry, again bitching about homosexuality even though anyone with a brain doesn't give a shit about the buttsecks that the gheys have. Like any other deluded [[Christfag]], he thinks he is actually [[lie|helping]] the gays. Interestingly enough, Xiao-Feng-Fury also posted a journal bitching about the gays and how [[lie|AIDS is their fault]] even though [[niggers]] actually have a higher rate of the spread of AIDS than gays, proving that Christfags love their clusterfucks. Until this point, Reject was generally perceived as being better than before, but then again, he probably couldn't handle being an [[oxymoron|evolved fundie]].

== Fundies Say the Darndest Things! ==

Some of RejectedDreams' [[stupid|wisdom]] has been included on the website [http://www.fstdt.net/ Fundies Say the Darndest Things], such as his [http://fstdt.net/QuoteComment.aspx?QID=42092 "I'm a Christian, but..."] rant, all of which can be found by searching "RejectedDreams" on the site. [[Xiao-Feng-Fury]] quotes are also on FSTDT.

|If Creation is true, then there is a Creator to whom we are all accountable. [[Evolution]] is an [[fag enabler|enabler]] for [[atheist|atheism]]. Evolution gives atheists a basis for explaining how life exists apart from a Creator God. Evolution denies the need for a God to be involved in the universe. Evolution is the "creation theory" for the "religion" of atheism. According to the [[Bible]], the choice is clear. We can either believe the Word of our omnipotent and omniscient God, or we can believe the [[logic|illogically biased, "scientific" explanations of fools.]]|The man who thinks he's better than a scientist.
|The Bible describes real places, people, and events that actually happened. Doing unbiased research into it's fulfilled prophecy, archaeology, changed lives, and non-biblical accounts was enough to convince me.|Just like how a science book describes actual fact with sources.

Out of the many comments made on his [[idiot|idiocy]], this one is perhaps the most [[winnar|winnage]]:
