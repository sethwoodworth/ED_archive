Otakin
A [[community]] for [[Otakukin]], AKA those awesome once-thought-fictional characters NOW IN HUMAN FORM!

Otakin (now known as [http://community.livejournal.com/from_fiction/ "From Fiction"]) was once a thriving ground for great discussion. It's died down a bit, removing any lulz fun you people would want to have. In fact, ota communities always die down in a few weeks since the people there end up realizing that people will [[troll]] them anyway.

Many members have [[Asperger's Syndrome]], like Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, and Quentin Tarantino. In other words, they're gonna take over your fucking world, man!
