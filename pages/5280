'''Megan Taylor Meier''', a.k.a. {{myspace|109782507|*Megan Babi*}}, is known for committing [[attention_whore|suicide]] after being [[Bullying|bullied]] to death by her friend's mom. Meier was a typical [[13-year-old girl]] fighting off the demons of low self-esteem, [[Dental Plan|braytheth]], [[ADD]], and [[Fat|being fat]]. She <s>is</s> was [[fat|175 pounds]] at 5'5Â½" after losing 20 lbs, giving her a BMI of 29.1, or technically, '''"[[fat|obese]] [[whore]]"'''. The [[Suicide|killing of self]] happened after being rejected and insulted by Josh Evans, one of her [[pedophiles|cute new friends]] on [[MySpace]]. Unfortunately for Megan, Josh was nothing but a fabrication created by evil neighborhood [[Insane|helicopter-mom]] [[Loli|Lori]] Drew. 

==Early life==
Since early childhood, Megan suffered from depression and ADD. She considered herself a fat, bubbly piece of blob, and the ADD meeds didn't help make things better.

==The [[Troll]] that couldn't Troll==	
[[Image:CCUDREW2.jpg|thumb|Curt Drew, handsome helicopter husband and Foosball enthusiast]]
[[Image:Megan Meier Christina Meier.jpg|thumb|Megan's mom was really critical of her daughter's appearance. (I'd hit it.)]]

'''Megan Meier''' had previously gotten into trouble with her mom for whoring around on [[MySpace]], and so, as a [[dramatic]] [[angsty]] teen, her internet activity was being [[Nazi|closely monitored]]. Her mom held her account password, and she wasn't allowed to sign on without permission. Megan was a textbook sufferer of [[Internet Disease]], displaying several <s>cute</s> [[fat girl angle shots]] on her [[MySpace]] account, when she was, in fact, a [[fat|blimp]].	
	 	
===Enter the Drew Family===	

The Meier and Drew families lived four doors away from each other and were close, going on vacations together and having each other over for swinger parties involving [[buttsecks]]. However, '''Sarah Drew''' is an overbearing teenage [[bitch]] with [[borderline personality disorder]]. After years of on-again, off-again friendship bullshit, '''Megan Meier''' had enough and told Sarah that she couldn't be her friend any more. Suffering from this tragic loss of power and control over those around her, Sarah went crying to her mom and dad. Sarah's momma, '''[[troll|Lori Drew]]''', knew that Megan was nothing but a [[fat]] [[loser]] that should have been ''thrilled'' to have any friends at all. Moreover, nobody... '''nobody''' ... will ever upset her baby girl and get away with it. So, [[troll|Lori]] did what any [[Batshit|rational parent]] would: She went to [[MySpace]] and created the hunky teenage persona of "Josh Evans" as a means to snoop on Megan and ultimately exact revenge.

===Joshin' Around===	
[[Image:Lori-drew-lulzy.jpg|thumb|Lori Drew, cyberbully and almost-murderer]]
[[Image:Yotsuba_copy.jpg|thumb|The parents initial reaction.]]
[[Image:Megan_Meier_MySpace.jpg|thumb|Typical [[newfag]] comments.]]

It started innocently enough... Josh popped up out of nowhere and sent Megan a friend request, and Megan blindly accepts the friend request from this person she only now knew existed. Megan's mom, '''Tina Meier''', was apprehensive, but Megan's ''"He's so hot, mommy!"'' argument won her over. For several weeks, the boy would regularly send messages to Megan, finding his way into her comfort zone, but claimed not to have any phone number that they could use to engage in [[sex|typical teenage small talk]].	
	 		
Eventually, Josh started "hearing things" about the horrible ways that Megan treats her friends, and bulletins were being posted... "Megan Meier is a [[slut]]," "Megan Meier is [[fat]]." This angered Megan so, because it exposed her status as a [[internet disease|secret internet fatty]]. Finally, on 16 October 2006 (the day before Megan's 14th birthday, and, according to weather.com, a fine day to hang oneself), Megan got into a huge MySpace [[flame_wars|tardfight]] with her schoolmates. [[Your Mom|Her mom]] kept yelling at her to sign off but due to her sick [[internet disease|internets addiction]] she could not. Then she received one last message from Josh Evans: 		
	 	
{{quote|Everybody in O'Fallon knows how you are. You are a bad person and everybody hates you. Have a shitty rest of your life. The world would be a better place without you.|Josh Evans, a.k.a. Megan's friend's mom's [[MySpace]] [[sock puppet]]}}

===Going into the closet===
When Megan's mom found out about Josh Evans, she recognized that her daughter's self-esteem had been damaged by this situation. Instead of nurturing her self-esteem by taking her shopping, she inflicted further damage by yelling at Megan for not following her [[rules of the Internet]].   

In fact, it was that verbal berating from the mom that caused Megan to go storming to her room in an heroic prissy-fit, where she eventually hung herself and gave out a really loud death rattle. After the death rattle, that's when her parents went to check on her and they saw her hanging there. Watch this video for proof: 
<br/>
<youtube>HFsfDLCkfQU</youtube>
Megan's father explains <s>Megan's</s>([[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]].  MEGAN WAS ALREADY DEAD.) his wife's blood-curdling scream at 2:34. Also notice at 0:30-0:40 how Megan lies that she is 16 on her MySpace page when she was clearly 13. Megan's father appears to be part [[azn]], as evidenced by 3:18, "PREASE WAKE RUP"
<br/>
{{quote|I was right there. I held her and I yanked the whole '''closet thing''' out of the wall. Tina ran and got a knife so I could cut the belt from around her neck, and then started performing CPR.|Ron Meier, [[CNN]] Interview, 16 November 2007}}

===What Really Happened===	
	 	
The [[lie|truth]] is that such a short stop was not likely to kill Megan Meier but only put her cervical spine in a vulnerable position. A more realistic scenario is that Megan's mom  by ripping apart the closet and trying to get Megan down, managed to finish her daughter off.

==[[An hero|Blog-icide]]==

On 12 November [[2007]], more than a year after Megan's [[Cryptokids#Self_Murder|self-murder]], she officially became [[an hero]] when the story of her [[An hero|blog-icide]] went public... on blogs, and then on news wires. Smelling [[money|blood]], all the Jew [[whore|news networks]] got in on the action, finding reporters with the best head-bobbling mealy-mouthed fake-shocked expressions and putting them on location "LIVE".

===Almost Murder===

Because Megan was killed by the Drews using lethal hate words and [[internets]], '''justice must be served!'''  In the same vein that people who are [[almost raped]] want sympathy, many [[butthurt]] news Jew have insisted the local authorities and [[FBI]] [[IM PRESSIN CHARGES|press charges]] for [[murder|almost murder]] in this case.  Unfortunately, as it turns out, [[suicide]] isn't [[murder]].  But there is hope!  Killing someone with e-mail is the closest thing to murder since [[trepanation]], and that gives Megan's parents greater leverage in the [[American]] justice system.

===[[Death]] by [[MySpace]]===

The Meiers humbly [[lies|state that they do not need revenge]].  They want [[Free Speech|the law]] changed so that what happened to Megan is a crime.  They would call it '''MySpace Fraud''', perhaps.  Or '''Three Lies and You're Out'''.  Or maybe, '''Don't Ask, Don't Dangle'''.  Yard signs in the neighborhood say, "Justice for Megan Meier", "Call the St. Charles County Prosecuting Attorney", and "MySpace fraud in your neighborhood".  What's next?  A sign that says "Join us at www.fucktheinternets.com!"?

Legally speaking, any real success at legislating Death by MySpace would result in '''An Hero Law''', not to be confused with [[Megan's Law]].  This is the most popular pro-lobby point of view, but there are alternatives being suggested by commentators.

==Drew Family Address/Phone for the Lulz==

Lori Drew and Curt Drew
269 Waterford Crystal Dr
O'Fallon, MO 63368-7130
(636) 272-2670

==Aftermath==

The [[lulz]], however, were just getting started.

===Small Town Secrets===
Towards the end of the Drews' campaign of [[internet hate machine|internet hate]] directed at Megan, they [[conspiracy|recruited]] one of her teenage friends, [http://lads.MySpace.com/slides/slideshow_random.swf?u=101901697 '''Ashley Nicole Grills'''], to join in on the fun. On the night that Megan hanged herself, [[troll|Lori]] phoned Ashley up and instructed her not to say a word. "After all," spat [[troll|Lori]] into the mouthpiece, "since I already killed off one innocent teenage girl already, there'd be nothing stopping me from getting rid of a little snitch-bitch."

===Weird parents===
The day after Megan's death (without knowing that the Drews were involved), the Meiers went down the street to comfort Megan's "[[cunt|former friend]]" Sarah, and her [[fucktard]] parents, Lori and Curt. The Meiers let Sarah Drew know that, although she and Megan had their ups and downs, Megan valued Sarah's friendship. During this awkward conversation in the family room, the Drew family fidgeted and tittered guiltily. Tina Meier later remarked, "we should have known then and there; they were nervously raking their eyes from side to side like cartoon villains."

The Meiers also attended Sarah's birthday party and Curt's 50th birthday celebration, although [[emo|Ron, his eyes welling up]], had to leave when it came time to sing "Happy Birthday" - to this day, "Happy Birthday", balloons, or colorful napkins sends Ron Meier into a spasm of uncontrollable sobbing. In addition, the Meiers agreed to bring home a Foosball table and temporarily store it in the garage (the table was a Christmas gift the Drews received and needed to make room for). 

Now, not many parents attend two birthday parties the day after their daughter's death, '''Let alone''' schlep a '''fucking Foosball table''' to their house as a favor. But then again, Megan was obese and had only been 13 years old, so perhaps they didn't have much of an emotional investment in her.

===Axe and Sledgehammer===

Six weeks after Megan [[Auto erotic asphyxiation|self-murdered]], Ashley Grills succumbed to guilt and spilled the beans to several school officials and Megan's family. Upon learning that the Drews made up Josh, Megan's mom went out to the garage and, in an '''act of pure awesomeness''', impulsively grabbed her axe (becoming a [[MILF]]), Megan's dad his sledgehammer, and - with their '''His-and-Hers matched demolition set''' - together they ''busted the shit'' out of that Foosball table. Ron and Tina loaded the splintered parts into their pickup and delivered it to the Drew's lawn in a box spray painted, "[[fuck you|Merry Christmas]]". They did it because, as we all know, destroyed Foosball tables are perfect revenge for An Hero children.

===Police Report===

[[Image:Drew police report.jpg|thumb|right|Police Report: File under Foosball Table-cide]]

After the Meiers busted up the Drew's foosball deck, Lori Drew harrumphed and had no choice but to file an indignant police report, the only sensible thing to do. The report reads, in part:

{{squote|[Lori] Drew instigated and monitored a "my space" account which was created for the sole purpose of communicating with Meier's daughter. Drew said she constructed a profile of "good looking" male on "my space" in order to "find out what Megan was saying on-line" about her daughter. Drew explained the communication between the fake male profile was aimed at gaining Megan's confidence and finding out what Megan felt about her daughter and other people. Drew stated she, her daughter, and Ashley all typed, read, and monitored the communication between the fake male profile and Megan. Drew went on to say, the communication became "sexual for a thirteen year old." Drew stated she continued the fake male profile despite this development.<br><br>Drew felt this incident contributed to Megan's suicide, but she did not feel "as guilty" because at the funeral because she found out "Megan had tried to commit suicide before."<br><br>Drew explained the neighborhood had recently found out her involvement in Megan's suicide and her neighborhood have become hostile to toward her and her family.  Drew stated she and her husband attempted to contact the Meier family three times, "banging on the door" although Mr Meier had already [[gtfo|told them to leave]].|Lori Drew|trying to explain the circumstances behind her fucked-up Foosball table}}

==After-aftermath==

After the proverbial [[internets]] [[shit]] hits the proverbial [[internets]] fan, everybody involved turns into verifiable [[pussies]].

===Counter-Trolls===

Since the identities of the Drews became public, tragically, they have now officially attained '''we are the victim here''' status. They receive harassing phone calls, letters, hoaxes, and calls to local authorities to please '''[[Fap|think of]]''' '''[[children|the children]]''' and do something. We are reminded at this point why [[Trolling IRL]] is so dangerous. 

The mayor of [[Missouri|Dardenne Prairie]], Pam Fogarty (more like Pam [[Faggotry]] [[amirite]]?), has ordered additional police patrols in the Meier's neighborhood.  "People are just totally shocked.  They can't believe that an adult would have done this.  The scary part is that when you look at the blogs and listen to the phone calls we're getting, it's very quickly becoming a mob mentality."

On 19 November, Tina Meier ran into puppet master Lori who "asked me to stop doing all of this.  I told her that we would not stop, that we were going to continue for [[for great justice|justice for Megan]] because they knew what they did."


====Hurry, Curt Drew Killed another teen OMG====
On 19 November, The local paper reported that:

{{squote|After most of the families in this quiet community went to bed, a half-dozen police cars sped down Waterford Crystal Drive, lights flashing.<br><br>A man, they were told, had been fatally shot inside a home.<br><br>Neighbors opened doors, peered out windows and watched. As many as 15 deputies, they said, drew weapons and charged the home of Lori and Curt Drew.<br><br>But there was no body lying in a pool of blood. No weapon in Curt Drew's hand. The call was a prank, one of many at the Drews' home this year. A lawn job. A brick through a window. Threatening phone calls. Paintball attacks.<br><br>The police are now worried residents will take the law into their own hands. "Everybody in our department knows what's going on," said Lt. Craig McGuire, spokesman for the St. Charles County Sheriff's Department. "And everybody is afraid of what's going to happen there."|Law lags as taunts ruin lives|By David Hunn and Joel Currier}}

====Hacked Answering Machine====

On 21 November, The voice mail message on Lori's phone at her business was changed to a high-pitched falsetto with the following:

{{squote|Hi! Lori Drew, world famous teenage girl murderer!<br><br>Um, if you need any advice on how to drive the suicide of a fourteen year old teenage girl, um, or boy, I'll be glad to return your call.<br><br>Um, to the media outlets, my only statement would be that I did it for the lulz, L-U-L-Z; my only purpose in life was to do it for the lulz.<br><br>Um, you know, um, we were just doing it for the lulz, it's not our fault she offed herself to be quite honest with you. Um, so, so what? I mean, she probably would have done it anyways. I mean, she was obviously a dumb fat angry bitch. Um, I'd off myself too, wouldn't you?|Lori Drew's voice mail message|100%}}

====Drews Forced Out of Business====
4 December, still treating "Drew" as a four-letter word, AP reports these details from the Drew's lawyer:

{{squote|Since the case became public, the woman has had to close her advertising business "because people have been attacking her advertisers and they want nothing to do with her. They don't want the bad publicity," he told NBC. He said her friends and neighbors are afraid to talk to her.

"Her daughter has had to drop out of school because of the harassment," he said.|Associated Press}}

Curt Drew has reportedly been fired from his position as a Coldwell Banker realtor, and is working at the local Burlington Coat Factory outlet.

[[Image:Mhic1.jpg|thumb|A full commitment's what I'm thinking of!]]

====I've Been TRICKED!!1!====

On 18 November 2007, an anonymous person calling itself ''Kristen'' and claiming to be a classmate of Megan's wrote up a blog post full of <s>rational and exemplary writing</s> misspellings and poor grammar called '''[[Megan Had It Coming]] / Setting the Record Straight'''. Though ''Kristen'' starts off with "Megan and I were sort of friends...", the little [[cunt-turd]] then goes on to break the true story about what a bitchy, slutty, loudmouthed psycho Megan was, how she had this offensive obesity problem â "yeah she was kinda fat. But she made it seem like everyone was out to [[whale|harpoon]] her" (lulz) â and how Megan REALLY DESERVED TO DIE OK. As it turns out, Lori Drew is NOT EVIL after all b/c '''her intention was just to "check up on [Megan] to see what shit she was spreading about my daughter"!'''

Many comment pundits theorized that ''Kristen'' was (''gasp!'') yet another of Lori Drew's [[sock puppet|sockpuppets]].  On 3 December, this same anonymous person posted a badly-crafted piece of [[bullshit|fiction]] claiming it to be Lori Drew's manifesto.  It lacked detail of any sort, and included such gross generalizations as, "I was distraught over the event, so I instructed the key people involved to stay quiet," and "Megan coordinated a MySpace attack on my daughter."  More to the point, this blog entry trolled up thousands of flame comments followed by national press and LIVE TV coverage.

4 December, Faux News reports the St. Charles County Sheriff Department's Cyber Crimes Unit [[drama|is investigating]] the source of the Megan Had It Coming website.  "Drew's family says she didn't write a word of this."

9 December, the MHIC blog reveals itself as a troll by posting a [[rickroll]], and linking to the [[Megan Had It Coming]] article on [[ED]], FTW.  Many lulzy editorial retractions, LIVE TV drama, and "You've been Rick-rolled lulz" blog entries are expected to emerge this week.

[[Image:Megan_Meier_USDOJ.jpg|thumb|From the creator of [[4girls]] comes the hit new TV ad Taking a Bite out of Megan Meier.]]

===U.S. Government: Megan is "a big fat clown"!===
The U.S. Department of Justice has published a new Cyber-bullying ad campaign with a radio version saying, "Hey Megan? You're a total freak. God you're ugly. And dumb!!"
[http://www.ncpc.org/newsroom/current-campaigns/cyberbullying/cyberbullying-radio-public-service-announcements/megan.mp3 In the Kitchen with Megan]

===Ron's Light-Up Angels===

The death of their fatty daughter having tested their relationship, Ron and Tina Meier have now separated, are pursuing divorce proceedings, and have filed restraining orders against each other (seriously lulz). Tina and Megan's sister went to stay with Tina's mom, and Ron mopes around the empty house with a dripping nose and a couple of shitty Xmas angels.

{{squote|The house on Waterford Crystal Drive feels empty, Ron says. Ron has added stuff. A [[gay|pink Christmas tree]], decorated by friends. Two volleyballs, signed by Megan's teammates and classmates. A Hershey's bar, just like Megan used to <s>hoard</s> give out for good cheer. There are also two light-up angels, hung in the front window. Most nights, when Ron gets home and the street is dark, he plugs in the angels, [[fapping|rubs one out]] and he feels a little closer to Megan.|St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 19 November 2007}}

It has been determined that he does, indeed fap to his [[necrophilia|dead]] [[incest|daughter]].

===Great Justice===
====County Prosecutor Pussies Out====
[[Image:Megan_Meier_Jack_Banas_mod.jpg|thumb|moar like County Pushover amirite?]]
3 December 2007, In a much-anticipated, year-too-late LIVE press conference today the St. Charles [[Bureaucratic Fuck|County Prosecutor]], '''Jack "This Shit is Bananas" Banas''', announced (drum-roll, please) his office will be going to the ends of the Earth to stop people from harassing the Drew family.  That's right, no charges are being filed against the Drews themselves.  Choking back tears, he says:

{{squote|Because we can't prosecute somebody, it certainly doesn't justify violating the law.  We live, in this country, by the rule of law.  We have to.  Otherwise, we lose our civility.|Jack Banas, omg I'm on LIVE TV, 3 December 2007}}

The Faux News coverage also claims the final Kill Yourself message was written by Drew's 18-year-old employee, who is being hospitalized for psychiatric problems and, "she herself may be suicidal." One can only hope.

====Banas Sued by Butthurt Newspaper====
St. Louis Post Dispatch has sued Jack Banas to gain access to his '''[[dox|classified state secrets]]'''.  In their self-gratifying December 21 editorial, reporters explained why a 10-page FBI report, already a year old, should be made public.  Presiding circuit court judge '''Ted "The Doctor" House''' has already ruled against them, [[FTW]].  In their lasting efforts to [[attention whore|soak up as much attention as possible]] and milk advertising revenue out of Megan's death, the newspaper posted a copy of the FBI report on their website showing that all 10 pages had been censored.  The FBI demanded Banas not provide information to newspapers.

[[Image:drphil.jpg|thumb|The episode devolved into racism amongst XBox Live junkies.]]

====MySpace Fraud Goes Federal====

9 January 2008, The LA Times reports '''Federal prosecutors have organized a grand jury to indict Lori Drew on charges of MySpace Fraud.  Holy shit!!'''  Christina Meier flew to New York with neighbors Christine and Blaine "Buzzcut" Buckles to appear on the {{youtube|l2JJRw6h-jE|Today Show}} and [http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/1003 Dr. Phil] the same day the story broke.  {{youtube|uWMTll-GlJI|This video}} helps to explain [[WTF]], as well as several other videos emerging as the result of Big Media's holiday vacation-from-24/7-coverage-of-Megan-Meier being over now.  The Federal prosecutors seem to think Lori Drew could be tried on charges of lying to MySpace about her age and gender.  This is what your tax dollars get you after the body's been cold for 15 months.

With a slow bellowing sound, like a large balloon deflating, the EFF dragged its hairy ass-cheeks into the controversy. Kurt Opsahl, a senior EFF attorney, shamelessly compared Lori Drew with Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, the de-facto inventors of Almost Murder and, apparently, all forms anonymity. "People can and should be responsible for their online actions, but one should address the actions, not the pseudonym."

The only thing still missing from this latest <s>advertising</s> media frenzy is a press photo of the '''Be a buddy not a bully''' tee-shirts from the Character Education Council's Anti-Cyber bullying Week at Troy Middle School.

===="Coming" Endorsed by Investigators====
19 February 2008, After months of tirelessly sifting through Rick Astley's discography, the St. Charles County Prosecutor concluded the Megan Had It Coming blog was among the best he had ever read.  Soothed by croons such as, "You know the rules and so do I," as well as, "Never gonna say good bye, never gonna tell a lie," Banas had no choice but to fully exonerate the blog's authors of any wrongdoing.  He also admitted that for all his efforts, he still didn't know the author's names, where they lived, or their connection to anyone involved in the story.  Banas, an avid fan of the Kennedy conspiracy theories, is known locally for his mediocre investigative endeavors, of which the Megan Meier murder, the Kurt Drew lawn and Foosball slaughter, and the grand larceny of Lori Drew's identity have been no exception.

===Legislation===

====City Passes An Hero Law====
On [[Last Thursday|21 November 2007]], The [[Missouri|Dardenne Prairie]] Aldermen surrounded [[Ted Stevens|the Intertubes]].

The six-member Board made Internet harassment a misdemeanor punishable by up to a $500 fine and 90 days in jail. Mayor Pam Fogarty said the City had proposed the measure after learning about Megan's death.

The four-page ordinance defines both harassment and cyber-harassment, making it illegal to engage in a pattern of conduct that would cause a <s>retarded</s> reasonable person to suffer "substantial emotional [[Butthurt|distress]]," or for an adult to contact a [[16 year old girl|child under 18]] in a communication causing a [[Retard|reasonable parent]] to fear for the child's [[An hero|well-being]].

City attorney John Young said [[Troll#Techniques|constitutionally protected activity]] would be exempt. The measure would apply when one of the people communicating was in Dardenne Prairie (or was called Lori Drew and had lived in Dardenne Prairie at some point in their life).

====State Anti-Lulz-Makers Ponder Megan====
28 January 2008, The Missouri [[Orgy|Senate]] heard [[Lies|testimony]] about [[Internet Law|a proposed law]] that, "would punish [[Your Mom|someone 21 or older]] who harassed [[16 year old girls|someone 17 years old or younger]] with up to four [[Ass rape|years in prison]]."  Ironically, the bill has no real chance of passing into law because it defines ''cyber bullying'' as, "Using coarse language offensive to a person of average sensibility."  It is more likely intended as a [[Butt plug|draft-pacifier]] to get Christina Meier to [[STFU]].

====Conviction tentatively overturned====
The judge tentatively threw the conviction of Lori Drew out the window. He may bring it back into the window in the [[future]].

{{quote|We call it cyber-bullying and we donât have a law to address it|an [[retard]], SIX HOURS AGO}}

==Denizens of teh Internets Respond==
[[Image:Bullingrabbit-x.jpg|thumb|Mr. and Mrs. Meier sobbingly daydream about bulls and rabbits]]
Displaying characteristic moderation and good taste, and wishing to spare the families any further grief, most [[internets]] users (realizing that they have nothing whatsoever to do with this drama) have kept their unqualified fucking opinions to themselves. There have, however, been some rare examples of peanut-gallery ejaculations.

{{quote|Megan's parents should consider selling the rights to make a movie.

Downside: Megan's parents would have to deal with petty people who would accuse them of profiting off Megan's memory. If it were me, I would keep the focus on making meaningful changes in My Space, the law, and destroying Megan's killer. I would ignore the mean spirited attacks. After all, isn't listening to mean people online what killed their daughter?|Sue 'em, Nov 12, 2007 7:58 AM}}

===Bel-Air===
Now this is the story all bout how<br>
My life got flipped, turned upside down<br>
So I'd like to take a minute [[Chris Hansen|just sit right there]]<br>
I'll tell you how my parents found me without any air<br>
In my parents basement born and raised<br>
On Myspace was where I spent most of my days<br>
Chilling out eating, not being cool<br>
And whining 'bout how my life sucked at school<br>
When I was flamed by some guy who I didn't even know<br>
Existed 'til about a week ago<br>
There was a minor earthquake and my mom got scared<br>
And found me danglin' in the closet without any air<br>
She whistled for my dad and when he came near<br>
He said "I called the paramedics, they're already here!"<br>
They gave me CPR til their faces turned red<br>
But they said, "Nah, forget it, she's already dead."<br>
I pulled up to the morgue around 7 or 8<br>
And Lori Drew yelled "Yo ho, troll ya later!"<br>
I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there<br>
To get eaten by worms with dirt in my hair.<br>

===End of Days===

===Broadcast Douchebaggery===
The 18 November ABC News broadcast contained, without explanation, subliminal images of '''someone's''' MySpace page.  As a result, phrases such as "Jesus is my home boy" and "masturbate" could be seen during frame-by-frame replay of the video.

The 4 December NBC News broadcast, during the first ever televised interview with Lori Drew's attorney, displayed without explanation a large splashy saying "LORI DREW IS A PSYCHOPATH".  The splashy quickly switched to a photo of Lori Drew before the interview concluded.

====Lori Drew indicted for almost murder====
May 15, 2008, [[troll|Lori Drew]] is indicted by a [[serious_business|Federal Grand Jury]] in an epic overreach by an aggressive prosecutor for 3 counts of almost murder and 1 count of extreme lulz.

"Both the [[Fatty|girl]] and '''[[MySpace]]''' are named as [[almost_raped|victims]] in the case" - AOL News

Megan's father, Ron Meier, 38, said he began to cry "tears of joy" when he heard of the indictment. The parents are now separated, which Tina Meier has said stemmed in part from the circumstances of their daughter's death. However, it is clear that she actually just loves the cock and has gotta catch 'em all.
