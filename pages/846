20:42 < nat> is chatting with me
20:42 < nat> and she has a MACBOOK
20:42 <@hep> tehdely you assume bantwn is a trolling org
20:42 < nat> and a fancy macbook cam
20:42 <@hep> its not
20:42 < tehdely> and it all started with someone vetoing ruin
20:42 < nat> or whatever the hell is in there
20:42 < tehdely> based on personal interest
20:42 <@hep> bantown is nothing anyone here but abad ever said it was
20:42 <@hep> :)
20:42 < nat> how do i see the video footage when i'm using linux?
20:42 < nat> are you going to start quoting Ginsberg?
20:42 <@hep> the thing is a lot of newbs came on bantown and started being all BANTOWN IS THIS BANTOPWN IS THAT BANTOWN IS A STATE OF MIND
20:42 <@hep> its not
20:42 <@hep> that shit is gay
20:42 <@hep> and for high school
20:42 <@hep> bantown is an irc channel
20:42 -!- g0sp [shelfsnus@yourass.com] has left #bantown []
20:43 <@hep> where people hang out sometimes
20:43 < tehdely> then why did you kick out weev
20:43 < tehdely> as if it was an organization
20:43 <@hep> just like every other channel
20:43 < mdl> nat: i have no idea. is there any ichat av-compatible thing for linux?
20:43 <@hep> we didnt
20:43 < tehdely> you were like 'weev is no longer a member of bantown'
20:43 <@hep> weev left
20:43 < tehdely> in some super official voice
20:43 <@hep> im just milking the drama :
20:43 <@hep> :)
20:43 < tehdely> honey if i logged this channel (i don't)
20:43 < tehdely> i would paste it back to you
20:43 <@hep> tehdely i say a lot of things
20:43 <@hep> for the lolz
20:43 < Bob> hep kicked out weev
20:43 <@hep> :)
20:43 < mdl> there's never been a bantown member list
20:43 < mdl> hep didn't kick him out
20:43 <@hep> no one kicked anyone out
Day changed to 20 Mar 2007
20:43 < mdl> weev left
20:43 < Bob> because hep is not comitted to the cause
20:43 <@hep> no one got kicked out
20:43 < Bob> no
20:44 <@hep> someone had a temper tantraum and quit irc forever
20:44 < Bob> weev left because hep would not go forward with mayhem
20:44 < mdl> just because she said that doesn't mean he couldn't have come back
20:44 < tehdely> but he's right next door
20:44 <@hep> and the rest of us are lolling about it :)
20:44 < nat> i dont know
20:44 < tehdely> and in case you didn't notice
20:44 < Bob> because she didn't want her kids to be fucked
20:44 < tehdely> the volume of chat in this channel dropped by about 5x
20:44 < nat> i was hoping someone would know more about ichat compatibilitiy around 
                 here
20:44 < tehdely> the instant he left
20:44 < Bob> and jail
20:44 < tehdely> because that's the day the ruin died
20:44 < nat> probably not
20:44 < nat> i lose
20:44 <@hep> ok tehdely
20:44 < Bob> or all sorts of emotionally charged bullshit
20:44 < nat> no hot cam chick for me
20:44 <@hep> feel free to go to whatever lame new group weev has
20:44 < Bob> bob knows and speaks the truth
20:44 <@hep> but weev has really never ruined anything real
20:44 <@hep> sry
20:44 <@hep> for all his talk
20:44 <@hep> he is all talk
20:44 <@hep> you know?
20:44 <@hep> ruining some other irc channel
20:44 <@hep> is gay
20:44 < tehdely> you just said you were all talk too
20:44 <@hep> its kid stuff
20:45 < tehdely> i don't know what to believe any more
20:45 < tehdely> i think i will ask this jenkem for answers
20:45 <@hep> WE TOOK DOWN GNAA
20:45 < tehdely> what?
20:45 <@hep> WE TOOK DOWN x IRC SERVER
20:45 < tehdely> gnaa took itself down
20:45 <@hep> all that shit
20:45 < tehdely> oh
20:45 <@hep> is gay
20:45 <@hep> you know?
20:45 <@hep> irc fighting with other irc
20:45 <@hep> its like cliques fighting in high school
20:45 < mdl> gang wars
20:45 <@hep> not even that real mdl
20:45 <@hep> more like
20:45 < mdl> niggerfites
20:45 < tehdely> hep there would be no division right now if you had just let weev go 
                 ahead with the (quite real) ruin he was planning to do
20:45 < tehdely> if you're so sure that he's all talk
20:45 < Bob> HEH
20:45 < tehdely> why did you suddenly get all srs biz
20:45 < tehdely> when he proposed to do something
20:45 < Bob> yes
20:45 <@hep> tiffany told tina that andrea slept with casey and now casey broke up 
                 with malory
20:45 < Bob> i agree
20:45 < tehdely> well, real
20:45 <@hep> etc
20:45 < Bob> i agree
20:46 < mdl> hep: lol
20:46 < Bob> hep you suck cocks
20:46 <@hep> tehdely i said dont bring it back to us
20:46 < Bob> all day
20:46 <@hep> abad said ont bring it back to us
20:46 < tehdely> hep but that makes it like 'us' is osmething more than an irc channel
20:46 <@hep> weev threw a temper tantraum and quit irc 4ever
20:46 < tehdely> so bantown IS an organization now
20:46 < tehdely> make up your mind
20:46 -!- asic [asic@serious-ABCD1DC.com] has left #bantown [Leaving]
20:46 <@hep> no bantown DOES lead right back to certain people tho
20:46 <@hep> irl
20:46 <@hep> regardless of WHAT it is
20:46 < tehdely> well you should be prepared to deal with that
20:46 < tehdely> as long as you make yourself the center of 'bantown'
20:46 < Bob> YO THATS FINE HEP
