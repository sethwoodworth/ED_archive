{{notice|Not to be confused with [[Jimmy Wales|James Cameron]]'s [[2009]] [[movie]] [[Avatar (movie)|Avatar]], which has more to do with blue, tall [[alien]] [[furfags]] than it does a [[shota]] with the powers of [[Fuckin' Magnets|water, fire, air and dirt]].}}
The popular fake [[anime|animu]] series [[Retard|Avatard]] was created by two faggot [[weeaboo]]s in order to amass obscene piles of Jew gold from other [[weeaboo]]s. [[Otaku]] are known to cry and scream that ''Avatar'' isn't [[anime|animu]] as it was made by Americans but they can go suck a dick because everyone knows [[American]] [[Porn|animation]] does everything better. [[No|Right?]]

[[Image:TyMaifun.jpg|thumb|right|A typical scene from ''16-year-old girl|Mean Girls err I mean Avatar!''.]]
This show being [[overrated|overrated]] and now having being made into a [[Epic Fail|Movie]], is about a bunch of [[High School Musical|whiny teensies]] who know kung fu and have the ability to summon [[Shit|nature powers]] without the help of Captain Planet. They spend most of their time [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|learning valuable lessons about lame shit and teaching white children an extremely loose interpretation of Azn voodoo moon religion]]. Aimed at the [[Fail|6-11]] age demographic it naturally has a bunch of [[batshit insane]] [[B|fans in their 20's and 30's]] that make this shitty show all kinds of uncomfortable for the fine peoples of the internets.

Hopefully this article will teach you about how dumb cartoons or anything is today from Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. That the NTF, CTNWF,DCF and Looney tunes are now officially dead to the general public, and only rich people are only allowed to see them in sister networks.  That when your children are watching shit like this now, you'll ask yourself "What was old school cartoons, like on network television?" One answer "Beautiful, before 2004." If you Choose [[Shit nobody cares about|Don't care.]] then [[GTFO|go to hell, wretch]].

*'''[[Jesus|Aang]]''': A painfully saccharine and wide-eyed [[shota|little boy]] who [[bestiality|loves animals]] and is supposed to save the world with the power of blasphemous godly [[Azn]] [[Gay|magic]]. His [[Its a trap|innocent appearance]] masks his perverted fantasies of [[secks|plugging]] the only [[Whore|girl]] who will [[Buttsecks|talk]] to him.

*'''[[Girlfriend|Suki]]''': A kabuki cosplaying bitch whose anomalous existence as Sokka's fuck buddy could only be explained as [[hentai|the creators' hardcore fantasies]] come to life [[imaginary girlfriend|on paper]].

*'''[[Fag|Zuko]]''': An [[emo]] [[flame wars|burn victim]] [[Incest|mama's boy]] with daddy issues who goes through more character and costume changes than anyone else in the fucking show because the writers couldn't decide who the fuck he's supposed to be.

*'''[[Batshit insane|Azula]]''': Angry [[lesbian|lesbo]] who also [[Incest|fucks her daddy on the side]].

*'''[[Lemonparty|Iroh]]''': The [[Star Wars|Yoda]] of the ''Avatar'' show. Pretty cool for a [[Diabeetus|fat old man]], seeing how he can still get [[Steroids|ripped]] while being [[over 9000]] years old. Solves all problems with [[drugs|tea]].

==Plot==
A bunch of [[Azn|Azns]] willfully segregate themselves into kingdoms according to who can throw what elements out of their hands until these sun-obsessed fire dickholes, [[lie|who totally don't ooze Imperialist Japan/Communist China out of every orifice at all]], invade and pillage everyone else for 100 years. A scrawny little kid who was in suspended animation for those 100 years has to [[Pokemon|CATCH 'EM ALL]] and gain a power level of [[over 9000]] to stop the war. Yeah. That's about it.

==Fanbase==
[[Image:Bryke_s_Convention_Guards_by_Booter_Freak.png|thumb|left|The [[truth]].]]

Obviously nothing in this world would be so [[lulz]]y without an insane and rabid fanbase populated by maladjusted tweens and manchildren behind it. As ''Avatar'' rose in popularity, its level of fantards began to reach critical mass, and if it weren't for the [[shit|film]], it's estimated they would of become as horrifying as ''[[Sonic]]'' fans by [[catnarok|2012]]. And while all the bitching, shipping and [[Flame wars|flames]] goes on, the creators are just sitting back counting all the Jew gold they made off of everyone. Lucky for us [[EDiots|normal people]] though, the horrendously shitty ''The Last Airbender'' film managed to suck so bad that the ensuing [http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/07/02/in-protest-against-the-last-airbender-fans-find-empowerment/ protests], [[butthurt]], and [[offended|overall disgust]] managed to destroy, or at least [[pwn|diminish]] what was left of the already dwindling [[16 year old girls|fanbase]].

==[[Ship]]ping Wars==
"[[Ship]]pers", as they like to be called, are losers [[shit_nobody_cares_about|giving a shit about who fucks who]] in any given form of entertainment for lack of a love life of their own. ''Avatar'' shippers are especially persistent even though this is an [[pokemon|American "KID" show]] and the likelihood of [[your mom|anyone]] getting fucked is zero. That's [[Japan]]'s department, kids! Over the course of the 3 long (and progressively lamer) seasons the arguments over which kid will finger bang which kid has gotten more and more [[drama|intense]] as fans wait for the [[shit_nobody_cares_about|final episodes to air]].  

Shippers are always:

*Girls or fags
*Fat
*Lonely
*Masters of the print screen button and [[MS Paint]]
*All of the above

Now that the [[epic win|series is finally over]] and the endgame couples are set, much [[In the ass|butthurt]] is to be had by everyone that was not right about their ZOMG TRUE LOVES couple of choice.  

On the other side, some sort of retarded gloating epidemic has started to happen on the online communities for this show, like people who guessed the shota would arrow-cock-bang the brown chick deserved an award for believing in the shotacon that is Kataang from the very beginning.

tl;dr  if you went "kekekeke" or "baaaaaw" about anybody making out in this show you are a moron. 

===How to Troll===
I think Avatar the Last Airbender is a [[Pretty cool guy|pretty cool guy.]] eh fights against them firebenders and doesn't afraid of anything.

Have [[YOU|you]] and your friends post this more than 3 times, and youll get [[Lulz|proffesional results]].

Proof : http://rule34.paheal.net/post/view/423971 Fire123,

===Zutara===
[[Image:Artist_at_work_by_charizardag.jpg|thumb|left|"Zutara" [[fangirl]]s are certainly not living vicariously through their fantasy relationship! They have REAL reasons to be upset.]]

[[Image:Proofofzutara.jpg|thumb|right|The single scene in the entire show Zutarians cling to.]]

The ''Abbabar'' fandom has developed a huge, insane shipper faction the likes of which haven't been seen since the [[Harry_Potter#GINNY_IS_A_SLUT_zOMG!!1!|"Harmony" incident.]] They call themselves "Zutarians", perhaps in reference to the planet they're from. These alien [[fangirl]]s differ from their [[yaoi|Earthly cousins]] in that they're rabidly obsessed with a ''heterosexual'' coupling, a rare and curious trait indeed. 

However they must share a common ancestor as the Zutarians are so insistent on a pairing that had no indication of ever happening that they fully expected the very fabric of reality to bend to their will, only to shit all over the internet when it predictably didn't, screaming and crying that the writers of the show are openly mocking them and toying with their emotions. 

Which in the end is probably close to the truth as the show's creators (apparently a two-headed manbeast collectively known as "Bryke") find this shipping business amusing as fuck and have made a national pastime of what one could call "[[trolling|ship baiting]]".

[[TL;DR]]: '''Zutara is all about ANGRY DRY RAPE.''' That will never, ever happen.  At least the dirty pics are good though, so if you must fap to this show and are not into shotacon its a good place to look for porn. 

[[Image:Zukokatarafuck.jpg|thumb|right|at least he is old enough to have hair on his balls.]]
[[Image:Zutara_Underwear_by_BBH.png|thumb|left|What goes on inside the mind of the average Zutarian.]]
[[Image:Zzzzztttttddddd.jpg|thumb|left|The sane and rational faces of the Zutarian community. THEY WILL NOT BE SILENCED!]]

===The Spoilers That Killed Zutara===
For the lulz, whoever runs the ''Cadavatar'' mass franchising money machine decided to release a bunch of [[shit]]ty books that spoiled the ending for all the [[fangirl]]s who were stupid enough to buy them. This occurred before the last episodes even aired because Nickelodeon is keeping them locked in a vault until enough fantards waste their allowance or McDonald's paychecks on DVDs and poorly made plushies for their liking.

Where most fantards would be upset with learning how the ultimate bad guys are defeated our visitors from the distant stars are upset that two characters who quite blatantly like other people aren't going to fuck like dirty monkeys during the final episode, blaming this on the writers mocking them, writing their story wrong, sucking at romance writing, and the show not being made in Japan. This also hasn't stopped the Zutarians from penning lengthy essays about how the book is a fake, an elaborate hoax cooked up by those vile "Kataangers" in the next star system, or that it was intentionally released early and meant to trick the audience of their finances until the actual finale airs.

===THEY CRUSHED OUR SPIRITS===
All over DeviantART and [[LiveJournal]] socially awkward fangirls with very empty lives erupted in a maelstrom of fan whining. The Zutarians were full of [[drama]] because most of them are privileged America children and have never encountered any real suffering in their entire lives, and full of [[batshit]] paranoia because they take everything the creators of the show say personally. The Kataangers meanwhile were off squawking and gloating on their own LiveJournals until their parents force fed them some Ritalin so they could get some goddamn sleep.

One 21 year old girl [http://thezutarianoasis.podbean.com/ who runs a goddamn shipping podcast] exhibited a perfect display of the widespread butthurt: 

{{squote|<small>I love you all to death and Zutara will still remain, in my mind, the best ship the world has ever seen....canon or not. I will ship it 'till the day I die and I hope you will too.</small>|[[hopeless|Perfectly rational and reasonable.]]}}

{{squote|<small>You don't know how hard or heartbreaking it is for me to write this to you. The feeling is honestly equivalent to the death of a relative. I want to believe so, SO bad that it is still alive. And it's painful to look at my old Zutara pictures right now, reminding me of the undying faith I used to have in this ship. I saw such enormous potential and beauty and.....*sigh*</small>|Bitch needs a hobby. And [[Islam|a real religion]].}}

One of her podcast [[circlejerk]] buddies also wrote a poem about their heartbreak to send to the creators:
<span id="AvatardPoemLink" class="toggleLink"></span>
<span id="AvatardPoemCollapseText" style="display: none;">[Click to Collapse]</span>
<span id="AvatardPoemExpandText" style="display: none;">[Click to Expand]</span>
<span id="AvatardPoemInitialState" style="display: none;">0</span>

<div id="AvatardPoem" style="padding: 5px; ">{{squote|<small>All was said and done,
The pain had disappeared
And no more did she consider
Him her enemy
So valiant was his soul
And deeper was his heart
She realized how wrong she had been

And it clicked.

Finally after so long
A realization so true came haunting
In her lungs
Came chilling in her bones
And as she reached to thank him with a kiss
For his audacious spirit

The world stopped and sirens sounded
Her eyes widened,
Because as soon as she yearned to love him
His body was torn apart.

Apocalypse exploded within the beautiful universe
And she cried out to the invisible gods: “Please! Turn back time!”

So they did, and on the second try
She smiled brightly, restraining herself
and moved on
To option boring,
Option “Let’s kill this storyline”

And the world shattered
Because on her back, underneath the clothing,
It said “Made in the USA”
Instead of “Made in Japan”

So she left.  
She defied all common sense, and thus
You pulverized reality into smithereens
Just for the sake of sympathizing with a fictional child.

<nowiki>*spit*</nowiki></small>|[http://mizsweet.deviantart.com/art/quot-SPOILERS-quot-Dear-Bryke-85428785 SPIT]}}</div>

===And Now, We Spit Upon You===
So the finale aired and surprise, surprise, all that had been foretold in the books of dark prophecy were true. Katara predictably hooked up with Aang and they shared a [[virgin|chaste closed mouth kiss]] and we could all forget this nightmare of [[fantard]]ism ever fucking happened.

Or so we thought.

But the [[fandom]] [[batshit|inexplicably]] refuses to die, as though their [[Sick fuck|sheer demented will]] can change the course of history for their [[Incest|own pleasure]] [[epic win|so they can continue dwelling in their basements living vicariously through the fictional relationship of two fictional children.]] This proved considerably [[lulz]]y enough to make the creators of the show come out at [[Comic_book_fans|Comic Con '08]] and turn a shitload of crappy ''Avatar'' fanart into a short film that not just reaffirmed that ''all'' of the weird, delusional ships were wrong, but mocked them thoroughly, which (accompanied by an affirmation that there would never be a Season 4 and thus no second chance for the fantarded shipdoms) was viewed by the [[Rule34|Zutarans]] as a [[lulz|gigantic insult]] and by the [[YOU|sane world]] as the biggest and most efficient professional troll since [[Super Smash Brothers|Japan Time]]. Also, puppets.

===Kataang===
[[Image:Aangvag.jpg|thumb|left| Did you know Aang has a vagina in his back?]]
[[Image:Kataraaangsmex.jpg|thumb|right| Katara LOVES the shota cock!]]
[[Image:Kataangcreepy.jpg|thumb|[[Pedobear|Spootay]],from deviantART [[http://spootay.deviantart.com]] says Aang is very mature for his age.]]

The opposite of Zutarians, anyone who identifies by this term can be assumed to be a complete [[retard]] who also spends way too much time and effort on insignificant shit that doesn't matter. Just as insane as any other Avatard shipper they are easily distinguished by their squishy prepubescent ideals on "ZOMG LUV" and "[[Rape|ZOMG DESTINY]]." These are the fat girls you see walking the halls of [[high school]] with "I <3 JOE" scrawled up and down their trapper keepers as they skip to class. "Kataangers" feel the need to [[No_life|compile evidence]] of the retarded Y7 relationship of [[hugbox|hugs]] already blatantly developing within the [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|show's canon]] and spend most of their time arguing with Zutarians and generally being annoying [[16 year old girls|13 year old girls]]. Kataangers would get along delightfully with [[pedophile]]s if they weren't so busy screen capping retarded hugs, because Aang is a [[shota]] and yet still manages to somehow gets him some.  Even though all shipper are fucktards with no life, now that Katara and Aang's fuck fest is cannon, they cant help but run around the internet yelling how they won like they are expecting a fucking prize for being able to notice the obvious facts.   

[[Image:Kataraaaangblow.jpg|thumb|right| 12 year old boy peen! NOM NOM NOM]]
[[Image:Avatarwank.jpg|center|frame]]

While Zutara and other popular ships have at least a good quantity of [[fap]]-worthy porn, its pretty rare to find anything of note concerning Aang sticking it to Katara. Possible reasons are any artist over 12 that would otherwise be drawing piles of porn of this show does not want to be labeled a [[pedophile]]. And the thought of a [[Shota|12 year old boy wanting some poon]] (outside of the art on [[b|/b/]] or /ss/) or even being able to pull it off is hard to buy. If Aaang was real he would be doing what every other 12 year old boy is doing: fapping to cleavage shots on Google and playing the [[Pokeman|Pokemans]].  Arrow boy and Brown girl fucking is [[shit nobody cares about|cannon]], but damn it sure makes you feel pedo...unless you are Shota Tiger and totally into tiny cocks.

==The Avatar Podcast==
How would you like to sit for about 30 minutes on average and listen to some creepy internet nerds analyze a children's show to the every last retarded detail? Look no further than [http://dongbufeng.net/podcast/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=11114&Itemid=31 From the Spirit World: The legendary podcast]!

The podcast is hosted by some guy named Dylan and a wide selection of guests who vary in their levels of suck any given week. While the co-hosts and subject matter may change every show, the one thing that does remain constant is that it always blows [[bestiality|giant Appa cock]] and offers nothing of value or [[porn|interest]]. It's basically just a bunch of [[basement dweller]]s talking about an episode and over-analyzing the FUCK out of it to the degree most nerds would reserve for ''[[teh_rei|End of Evangelion]]''. The only problem is this is a kids show on Nick, and thus there is nothing to think about. Also let's not forget the creepy geek wheeze-laughs Dylan sputters every few minutes when something "[[Anti-lulz|witty]]" is said, or when one can literally hear him popping a boner over [[Pedo|Aang shota pics]]. Below is a 100% accurate rendition of the podcast:

[[Image:Brainy.jpg|center|frame]]

Listening to this podcast for the full half hour will make you want to kill yourself for failing so hard at life that you loved a children's cartoon enough to listen to idiots converse about how "''Sokka's making a joke because he's emo for his daddy" or "[[emo|Zuko]] loves it up the butt because we saw him bend over 4 times this episode.''"
*Dylan- Whiny, Kataangist asshole who can and will cause brain damage just from his throaty, 12 year old nerd voice.
*Jake- Obviously a god because he gives spoilers which never turn out to be exactly right.
*Kevin- Hobbies include sticking his hand up puppets' asses and having nine year olds do his bidding.
*Meredith- Has daddy issues; her opinion consists of "I agree" or "I don't know." Fuck, this bitch is a keeper.
*Shay- Because everybody needs something to fap to, there to give blow jobs during breaks to the other co-hosts.
*Ally- Sounds like she is six to make Dylan feel a bit less girly.
*Abby- I SHIP ZUKO/CLOTHES I AM SO HILARIOUS AND WITTY. 
*Stephanie- She says she's sorry every other sentence, it makes for incredibly intelligent conversation.
*Joe- A spy from ED sent to rape Dylan after every other podcast to kick him off his high horse.

==The Great Sifu Kisu Drama of 2008==
[[Image:SRS BUSINESS GAIS by Booter Freak.jpg|right|thumb|Artist's representation]]

According to the [[tubes|internet]], [[Last Thursday|Last Thursday]], a member of CAPSLOCK_ATLA aka a LJ site for lulz and porn (lacking that all right now though) wrote some sexy fanfiction involving Sifu Kisu and other members of the ''Avatar'' staff for laughs. While [[porn|surfing around the internet]] one day, Sifu Kisu happened to find that shit and freaked out the only way that would get results...he posted a giant WTF about it in his MySpace blog. Drama and lulz ensued and the end result was him calling them a bunch of weird internet kids, and the journal members shooping the hell out of his photos and making him an ''Avatar'' meme of sorts. They also made sure to post his name a million times in each journal entry on the blog so that the internet search engines could find him better.

{{squote|<small> What kind of sicko kids on the internet would write gay fanfiction about me and Bryke?!  
</small>| Sifu Kisu- thinkin' 'bout doin' sumpin'}}

==How I Became Yours==
[[Image:howibecameyourstracing.jpg|thumb|Totally not traced.]]'''How I Became Yours''' is a 216 page ''[[Avatar the Last Airbender|Avatar: The Last Airbender]] fancomic''. Created by the [[tartlet]] {{deviantart|waterbender196|waterbender196}} ([[powerword|IRL name]] Jackie Diaz), it uses [[tracing|incredibly well-drawn art]] and [[lie|completely accurate character interpretation]] to tell the story of what happened after the show's ending.

===Plot===
{{quote|This is probably the biggest piece of shit fancomic I've ever seen, bar none.  From the clearly traced poses and faces, to the idiotic shipping, to the wildly misspelled and nonsensical dialogue, to the totally out-of-place Western clothing and settings, to the complete and total lack of any kind of consistent characterization, it hits pretty much every level of badness the fandom has to offer.| the poor sap who cataloged the entire series before '''waterbender196''' [[delete fucking everything|baleeted]] it.}}

====Chapter 1: Life in what is totally the Earth Kingdom why do you ask?====
[[Image:howibecameyoursDANDER.png|thumb|Mai might have put the country in DANDER, but at least she isn't a [[TITTY MONSTER|CHARD MONSTER!!!]]]]
The comic opens with Katara [[tl;dr|infodumping]] the audience about how beautiful the Earth Kingdom is. Then she cries for some reason. Toph runs into her bedroom to comfort her with some hot lesbian sex and tells the audience that it's "the anniversary" (straight-up stealing dialogue from Iroh and Zuko's conversation in the first episode of season two of the actual show). They walk to a memorial marker and we find out that it's actually the grave of Katara's aborted baby Kuzon.

We then flash back to three years in the past where we see a super-preggers Katara with a fish-lipped Sokka [[Pregnophile|pressing his face against her stomach]]. Katara punches him in the dick and  sends him into the kitchen to make her a sandwich.

At that very moment, far away, Fire Lord Zuko is angsting into the sunset about his inability to type out the word "you" instead of just using "u" all the time. Oh, and we also find out that Zuko is Katara's aborted baby daddy.

Three years in the future, Iroh busts down Zuko's door despite the sock over the doorknob and tells him that he must look inside himself to save himself because only then will his true self reveal itself. Oh, and that Katara was going to have his baby and name it something completely retarded but then it died. And now Zuko's real wife, Mai, is pissed.

Also, Toph has a massive rock-boner for Aang.

Back to Zuko, he and Mai have a fight where he keeps his pimp hand strong and she calls him a CHARD MONSTER and he calls her a TRATIOR and basically their marriage is so over.

====Chapter Two: Europe and Dead Babies====
[[image:howibecameyoursmiscarriage.png|thumb|Insert your favorite dead baby joke here.]]
This chapter begins with preggers!Katara hanging around being fat when a servant brings her moar food. Katara starts shoving everything she can grab into her fat face when suddenly HOLY SHIT THE APPLE WAS POISONED, TIME FOR A MISCARRIAGE!

The audience is then rocketed BACK TO THE FUTURE when Katara wakes up from this memory/nightmare and we get three pages of the exact same panel of her crying copypasted over and over and over again, interspersed with panels of her having sex with Zuko. 

Meanwhile, Sokka is wandering aimlessly minding his own damn business when he '''*hears woman grunting and whine in pain*''' and yes that is the exact "sound effect" used for this scene. Turns out its some ninja chick who done got herself stabbed so Sokka resists the temptation to stick his dick in the wound and instead carries her back to Toph's house.

Aang has a brief conversation with a tattooless clone of himself. Turns out Toph makes his panties wet, who knew.

Then Zuko shocks the entire Fire Nation by wearing his hair down so that Katara will recognize him when he goes back to see her. Uh, pretty sure you've already got a distinctive scar there, Zuko. You'd need some serious plastic surgery before anyone could mistake you for someone else.

While Zuko's getting some fabulous styling advice from his uncle, Katara's having a ball in 18th century Europe to celebrate her birthday. Every minor Avatar character gets their own OOC cameo and is quickly forgotten. Then Aang shows up and Toph cums everywhere. Then Zuko shows up with his hair in a topknot, completely negating the "I will wear my hair down and blow everyone's minds" scene earlier. We are treated to a sloooooooooow moooooooooootion scene of Zuko and Katara running towards each other across a ballroom full of photos of European royalty. They do it right there on the dance floor. Afterwards Katara informs Zuko that whoops his baby is dead and it died on the day before her birthday, HOW TRAGICALLY CONVENIENT!

====Chapter Three: A Whore's Redemption====
[[image:howibecameyoursturtleducks.png|thumb|The turtleducks blend seamlessly into the rest of the image.]]
[[image:howibecameyourstattoo.png|thumb|Zuko's tattoo. Do not adjust your monitor.]]
This entire chapter is basically just Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" with stupid names.

Ninja bitch wakes up and is revealed as PRINCESS AZULA OH SHIT! Except she has ~*~amnesia~*~ and thus no memory of who she is. Instead of doing what any sane young man would do and exploiting this fact in order to finally get laid, Sokka attacks her, proving once and for all that he is [[gay]]. Azula runs dramatically through a field but is unable to escape her European garb.

Then she stops to feed some hilariously Photoshopped turtleducks.

Katara catches up with Azula and they have a nice long [[Scissoring|chat]].

Meanwhile, Toph explains to Iroh, Aang, and Zuko that Azula is back. They promptly flip the fuck out but are placated by the reminder that this means there will be an additional vagina around, bringing the male/female ratio that much closer to 1:1.

Azula steals Belle's outfit and starts [[hippy|communing with the animals and shit]]. She also has nightmares about losing her mother, being consumed by blue flames, and missing out on the latest Evanescence concert. To comfort her, Toph and Katara braid her hair and have naked pillow fights. [[gay|Sokka reads poetry to her.]]

A few days later, Azula is hiding in a tree spying on Sokka when the tree branch breaks and they immediately fall into the sex position. Since Sokka is gay, Azula has no choice but to rape him.

Katara and Zuko have sex and it is revealed that Zuko got a really blurry tattoo to prove his love for her.

After sexytimes, Katara and Azula braid each other's hair and giggle for five pages. Every panel is copy and paste.

Then Azula runs through a fucking rainstorm with Sokka and makes out with him under a tree. Tragically, no lightning bolt strikes them both dead.

====Chapter Four: Mai reacts to the goings-on in a completely rational manner and gets killed for her troubles. SPOILER ALERT!====
[[image:How i became yours all look same.jpg|thumb|Zuko and Sokka are the exact same person, while Aang has a high center of gravity.]]
[[image:howibecameyoursbloodbending.png|thumb|Katara is a good person.]]
So apparently Mai has an older brother named Sho who is a trained assassin and a clone of someone from the [[Bleach]] universe. Whatever. Mai explains to Bleachy that she won't be happy until she sees Katara's head ROT ON A SPIKE! Shit just got real, yo.

Azula gets her memories back and cries over what a terrible person she was. Sokka swallows his gay pride and comforts her with sex.

Aang asks Toph to be his wife using a betrothal necklace, despite the fact that betrothal necklaces are a Water Tribe tradition, not Earth Kingdom. Instead of earthbending him to his knees so he can suck her dick in penance, Toph accepts his proposal.

Toph announces her engagement to Katara and Azula. They promptly squeal like [[High School Musical]] fans and have a tea party in celebration.

Aang announces his engagement to Sokka and Zuko, resulting in the most obviously copypasted page in the entire epic.

But all is not well in 18th-century Europe! We cut to Mai, who is plotting in [[Goth|gawffick]] darkness to visit the Earth Kingdom with her throwing knives coated in POISON. GASP.

Zuko broods into the [[Twilight|twilight]] while Aang and Toph have sex.

The next day, Azula and Zuko and Iroh have a touching [[orgy|family reunion]] and are joined by Ursa, who apparently [[Hot Topic|shops at the same mall as Mai.]]

Speaking of Mai, she shows up in Katara's bedroom and complains that Zuko never bought ''her'' flowers! Oh, and she confesses to being the one who poisoned the apple that caused Katara's miscarriage. Whoops. Katara cartwheels her way through a fight scene with Mai.

Toph and Ursa (who can apparently blend blue fire now, the hell?) rush to Katara's aid. Sokka is accosted by some mysterious assassin dude traced from a Bleach manga. Katara appears at the scene of Sokka's fight and starts waterbending Bleach-guy. Then Azula shows up and angsts for a bit about how her favorite fuckbuddy is in danger. She attempts to lightningbend at Bleach-guy but OH SHIT KNIFE IN TITS!

Yep, Mai's killed Azula, and Toph and Ursa finally arrive on the scene.

And then, in this comic's crowning moment of glory, Katara bloodbends Mai to death. [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|IN THE FUCKING DAYTIME]].

====Chapter Five: Epilogue====
(Also known as SWEET MERCIFUL CHRIST LET IT END.)

Five years in the future, everyone is happy. Azula is Yue for some reason, no one ever talks about anything that happened in the five years previous, and all of the characters have offspring, and all of the offspring have the ''exact same face''.

===Tracing, Mary Sues, and DRAMA===
[[Image:Howibecameyoursmoretracing.jpg|thumb|Screenshot? What screenshot?]]
Despite having no artistic ability, Ms. Diaz managed to produce over 200 pages of Zutara fantasy. How did she manage such a feat? Why, by [[Tracing|referencing]] screencaps from Avatar and sundry other [[anime|shows]] and [[Disney|movies]], of course!

Other TARTlets called her on her shit, but she denied accusations of tracing even when overlays of her comic panels and screencaps of the show matched up line for line. She was eventually banned from deviantART after [[at least 100|enough]] people reported it. This marks the first instance that devianTART has ever taken action against tracing, and it will probably be the last.

Ms. Diaz also ignored the show's established [[Asia|setting]] in favor of her [[Europe|own]], and made up her own [[Mary_Sue|character interpretations]] as well:
*Azula went from being a fearsome, psychotic killer to a tearful amnesiac who falls for Sokka. Oh, and at the end she becomes some kind of lobotomized reincarnation of Yue.
*Mai, formerly a sympathetic girlfriend to Zuko, becomes a shrew who [[lolwut|sends Katara a poisoned fruitbasket to make her miscarry Zuko's baby.]] (But it's okay, because Katara gets her back by bloodbending her to death.)
*Toph goes from being a badass action girl to being a simpering [[camwhore|nitwit]] concerned only with whether or not Aang thinks she's pretty.
*Zuko has sex with Katara despite his marriage to Mai, then beats Mai when she complains.
*Katara gets knocked up with Zuko's baby, then miscarries, then bloodbends Mai to death (during the daytime, wtf?), then reunites with Zuko and gets knocked up with even more of his babies.
*Aang exists to be rotated at odd angles and have painful expressions on his face. Oh, and to hook up with Toph.
*Sokka is just Zuko recolored and flipped. He brings Azula back to life by being really sad about her death.
*Suki does not exist, although her character design was traced and used as a Fire Nation servant.

===The Sequel===

It is coming. There is nothing we can do to stop it. [http://serenahehe6.deviantart.com/art/How-i-became-yours-fans-ATLA-173431393 THE END IS NIGH]

==The Great Movie Controversy==
That the series is going to be adapted for Hollywood by director M Night Shyamalamadingdong, the [[dumbass|genius]] responsible for [[bullshit|masterpieces]] such as "The Happening" and "The [[Lady]] in The [[Semen|Water]]". He also directed the "The Sixth Sense" but he stole the idea from some Nickelodeon show.

When news of who's casted reached the Avatar fanbase, a shitstorm blew over as the cast consisted of mainly white actors and Disney whore Jesse McCartney. However despite Jesse's shitty music tour getting in the way of his true destiny, Shyamalan suddenly got a boner for the kid in Slumdog Millionaire and cast Developer Patel for the role instead. This made the fandom [[Bawwwww|rage even more and claim the movie features white people leading Azns in roles meant for Azns, and the main villain is foreign.]] This news resulted in a [http://aang-aint-white.livejournal.com/646.html shitty letter writing campaign] which failed when it got to the studios as [[Nobody Cares|they were sent back to sender.]] 

Those avatards not screaming [[wat|"Damedesuyo!"]] about the casting are still very [[butthurt]].  Most fans of the show's lightheartedness and whimsy feel that Shamwow has instead gone in the ill-advised direction of [[Serious business]].  Quick to notice in trailers Katara's persistently weepy eyes, Aang's total inability to smile, and Sokka having never farted once during either domestic or international trailers.  The fandoms response?  [[Irony|THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS!]].  

In b4 the movie outsells Watchmen and every nerd rages.

When it came out, and the movie is [[some argue|arguably]] the worst shit ever.

[[Indian|M. Nite Shymasiasdfhasdifh]] managed to [[rape]] the plot by removing most of the important characters, including the Kyoshi warriors. That Indian guy has said in interviews that this was because he [[fap|liked]] them too fucking much and filmed way too many scenes about them. So, of course, the only logical thing to do was completely remove them from the movie. Many Suki/Sokka shippers nerd raged as he only got a piece of ass from Yue in this movie. The bending was no more than a series of bollywood dance moves.

Even if someone decided to walk into the movie having no idea of the original series whatsoever, they would still be entirely disappointed. The actors all have about as much acting talent as your average no-name drama major looking to "make it big" in Hollywood. While the carefree monk is off doing his best [[Keanu Reeves]] impression, the other two main actors seem like they are on the verge of tears.  Critics agree that it is one of the worst movies of all time. Hell, [[troll|Roger Ebert]] didn't even give the movie one star.  Fucking [[Twilight]] got two stars, confirming that there was a fundamental misunderstanding of how to make a movie.

|The Last Airbender is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented.|Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times|Unspeakably bad dialogue delivered by excruciatingly bad actors in a plot so illogical and stupid it kills unicorns.|Marc Fennell, Channel 10 Australia|A movie that's as thick as the earth, as enraging as fire, and about as watery and windy as a giant cinematic wet fart.|Matt Risley, Sky Movies|A boring, nauseating blockbuster filled with poor editing, painfully wooden acting, unrelenting dullness, and unimpressive special effects. It's so bad that it's gone past good and back to bad again.|Avi Offer, NYC Movie Guru|"Battlefield Earth" has a new rival for the title of "worst-film-of-the-last-20-years."|Cole Smithey, ColeSmithey.com|Shyamalan wanted to leave us shaking our heads and marveling at a terribleness that was not merely terrible, but a terribleness that leaves you astonished at just how very, very terrible it is.|MaryAnn Johanson, Flick Filosopher|Stilted dialogue, wooden acting, glacial pacing, cheesy special effects, tacky-looking sets, ugly costumes, poorly staged and edited action sequences, all shown in murky, cut-rate 3-D.|Lou Lumenick, New York Post|It is so bad that not only could Uwe Boll make a better movie than Shyamalan has done here, he already has.|Peter Sobczynski, eFilmCritic.com|This colossal folly, the fiasco of the summer of 2010 — gives us all a ringside seat at the sight of Mr. “I See Dead People’s” career gurgling down the drain.|Roger Moore, Orlando Sentinel|Let's just be honest: M.
