'''Daniel Kay''', ''DanielKay'' on [[Fur Affinity]], is a 24 year old German [[furry]] who has many sick fetishes such as [[scat]], [[fat]], diaper as well as transformation, if you needed a reason to hate furries even more, this is the guy that will give you reasons in which why all furries are [[sick fucks]]. He had caused quite a bit of drama on [[Fur Affinity]] as he made up a banner for Thanksgiving but it had caused so much drama that he didn't even know it.

==His art==
[[Image:Bored Daniel Kay.jpg|thumb|right]]
When Daniel Kay comes to art, he comes off more and more like an [[attention whore]]. He feels that he can cram his sick twisted fetishes down your throat with what he posts. He had posted several items of his favorite fetishes as seen below, to the point to where it makes small children cry as well as make your eyes bleed when you see this untalented artists [[crap]].

==Scalie Love==
As if his art isn't bad enough, he is rather [[FYIAD|passionate about scalies]] (furfag lingo for reptiles).  It is so ridiculous, it borders on a sick obsession to a point it makes one wonder if [[otherkin|he actually thinks he is one]].

===Scalie Pride Drama===
Since it is quite obvious Daniel has a lot of issues involving scalie pride, he whines and complains that his 'scalie friends' have bit the dust and turned into full fledged [[furries]]

{{quote|Well I guess I’ll be the only one but I noticed (or cares) but lately more and more scaly characters are disappearing either abandoned or replaced with furry chars

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against fur but I’m more of a scaly lover and it just kinda "depresses" me to see so many just "bite the dust"

I'm just wondering why they end up dropped by so many"|Daniel Kay on creeping everyone out with his love for anything scalie}}

====The Journals====
[[Image:Milkbig Daniel Kay.jpg|thumb|right|jesus fuck what is this?]]
At one point, he became so [[emo|depressed]] that he started writing a lot of [[tl;dr]] journals about scalie [[yiff|love]], [[gay|pride]], and how he [[butthurt|hated when his friends changed from a dragon character]] into a [[furry]]. He would also mention that they would change personalities and be a whole different person.  [[Some argue]] they changed because they saw how fucked up he actually was and wanted to distance themselves as much as possible from him.

{{quote|Ok something that keeps bothering me is when people say “lizards/reptiles don’t have breasts”, even if it’s just a few people I’m still bothered by that. So I thought I may put up a little theory why ANTHRO reptiles CAN have breasts:|Daniel Kay|Proving he is way to obsessed as even saying they aren't suppose to have them will "bother" him}}

====The Art====

One piece of "art" was an [[emo]]tional piece as he described it.  It caused quite a bit of drama as many people saw he was over reacting way to much and is basically obsessed.  However he also got sympathy from his [[hugbox]] friends who actually took sympathy, which leads others to believe they are just as fucked up as he is.

{{squote|Well... this is how i feel right now... yes it's about the scalies being changed to furs again... I hoped I was over it a bit at least but... it came back and hit me full force...

Every time I see a case of it I feel like I have to watch and, no matter how hard I try, can't do anything about it... I don't deliberately look for it but I seem to run into it again and again -..-

I'm aware that this is the artists business and the changed one probably isn't “suffering” like in this pic... but it just wont work somehow, I get that feeling of “one more had to go” every time... it would help if I at least knew a change isn't permanent but that's almost never said... and from past experience a change usually DID mean it was permanent...

I know it must sound hypocritical to say such stuff if you look back at some of the art I did already... and in fact it does mess with my head, I held back like drawing Danny in other shapes on doing a lot of art because in my head it felt wrong...


I'm sorry if I upset or offend anyone with this... I know every decision to do such a thing was their own and they probably had their reasons to... I wish I could finally just accept it but my mind and feeling just wont work together... my mood is really down right now and I don't feel like joking...

PS: sorry for the bad quality as well, please don't criticizes that... I couldn't really bear to work on this pic for too long as even that hurt...|Daniel Kay}}

==Depression==
[[Image:Naughty Daniel Kay.jpg|thumb|right]]
There are a few things that will bring Daniel into a relapse of depression.

*Tell him he has an ED article
*Scalies suck
*His artwork sucks
*Commission a very expensive drawing from him, but have no intentions on paying it.

He usually complains that people are being arrogant and assholes to him, which really ins't a surprise when he just whines and complains when he tries to get in touch with people from his past and they just look the other way and ignore him.

In other words 90% of his journals consist of depression and scalies.

==Banner Drama==
[[Image:november banner.jpg|thumb|The banner in question.]]
Back in November, Daniel decided it was a [[retard|smart]] idea to make a Thanksgiving banner, and after the banner was changed due to Dragoneer sharing the same [[fetishes]] as Daniel, there was a lot of drama on the forums and off the forums due to the shit this guy had pulled. The banner is the equivalent of [[AIDS]] as all those who enjoyed it had a [[fat]] [[fetish]] already. Drama ensued [http://forums.furaffinity.net/showthread.php?t=31544 on] [http://forums.furaffinity.net/showthread.php?t=31500 many]  [http://forums.furaffinity.net/showthread.php?t=31513 different] [http://forums.furaffinity.net/showthread.php?t=31537 threads] [http://forums.furaffinity.net/showthread.php?t=31562 in the] [http://forums.furaffinity.net/showthread.php?t=31548 forums.]

[[Image:possibledecember banner.jpg|thumb|Fail]]

When December rolled around he decided to do one for that month too with the site's mascots still suffering from [[diabeetus]] from November's banner.  This was an attempt at [[lulz]] but it was ultimatly [[fail]] as [[noone|nobody]] cared.

==Quotes==
