Arthur's Hall

"Arthur's Hall of [[Nazi|Viking]] [[gay|Manliness]]" is a cheap copy of [[Dick Masterson]]'s [http://www.menarebetterthanwomen.com/ trollpen] and was founded in reaction to the feminization of man. Arthur, the founder chose to exemplify manliness by humbly naming his establishment after himself and so began the great and manly journey to greater testosterone levels and [[masturbation]] fests. 

== Major Personalities ==
*Arthur, manliest of manly men. His fetish is body building, and locking threads when he doesn't have time to respond. He'd be a complete HeMan but has what Freud described as "A fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity," in regards to firearms. Arthur has banged [[over 9000]] [[lolicon|whores]].  Banging whores is manly, which is why he decided to get [[married]] to the first woman to turn him down for [[anal sex|anal]]. He is one of the most frequent posters to his own forum, clearly proving he has a viable income of the first rank. His accomplishments in life include having bigger biceps than [[your mom]].

*Motivation Man pursued the manly study of [[liberal arts]] because of his overwhelming [[genius|genious]]. He is so smart he used his real name while insulting [[niggers]], [[homos]], [[bitches]] and [[Jews|Joos]]. He made lengthy posts about how he wanted to shag the female students in the classes for which he was a teachers assistant, with his school email address listed on the account. In a [[duh|surprise move]], the [[university]] objected to this and booted him from the degree program. He now fills his days with part time minimum wage [[labor]], [[fapping]], and posting on the internet. He maintains his hairy chest thumping status by claiming he will [[surprise sex|raep]] other men who disagree with him. As of January 2011 his avatar was a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] who has been obscure for years and who was so manly he resorted to [[steroids]]. Clearly the idea of having one's manhood shrink to the size of 4 year old is appealing to him. Others have concluded its the manhood of four year olds that he finds appealing. Still, he's smarter than you.  He also has an awesome [[neckbeard]].  When not otherwise occupied, he logs in to this article to deny the [[truth]].

*Harry Paget Flashman, apart from stealing his name from a literary loser, shamelessly boasts of voiding his bowels, fapping, drinking cheap wine and getting tattooed in the [[Navy]].  Perhaps the closest to a man the vaunted Hall has, he devotes his declining years to collecting [[penis|guns]] which he waxes and polishes and strokes.  His vocabulary knows no bounds of era, class or language.

*[[Final Fantasy|Septithol]] is in fact among the ten or twenty manliest members of the forum. She finds this to be a great accomplishment. As so many of the members of the Hall are in fact clearly seeking a [[beard]], it is remarkable that she is still single. Perhaps her extensive knowledge of nutrition, firearms and [[Harry Potter]] fan-fiction are too intimidating.

*Shlomo was the <s>first</s> <s>tenth</s> most recent member [[banhammer|banned]] for having more [[Asperger's|ass burgers]] than Art and Bill.  Slo-mo managed to clog [[at least 100]] threads with "Hello. Hello.  Hello" and questions on what to do with Jews, without ever discussing the removal of them from the gene pool.

*Various [[liberal|libtards]]s who log in for the [[LULZ]], try to talk sense, realize it's a forum for [[redneck]] [[Nazis]] and leave.

*Various Nazis who talk about the awesome day when unemployed [[virgins]], former [[cops]], steroid-popping [[eunuch]]s and [[creationist]] [[Christian]] [[fundamentalist]]s kill all the [[sandnigger]]s.  As awesome as that might be, their only followup plans include lots of [[buttsecks]] and [[manhugs]].

== Forum Culture ==
Like many of the internets most loved websites a [[forum]] for its users was deemed a must early on. In the forums, cleverly dubbed "forums," the ten most commonly used words clearly express the tolerance, veneration of truth, personal achievement and moral rectitude of the dwellers of the Hall. They are as of December 2010 1)Rape 2)[[Nigger]] 3)[[faggot]] 4)[[slut]] 5)[[whore]] 6)[[kaffir]] 7)[[anal]] 8)[[bitch]] 9)[[basement]] 10)[[prison]]. With honorable mentions going to [[dik]], [[cock]], dysgenics, and [[skinhead]].

One of the forums subtopics is "Confessions of Manliness", despite its inspired title you will often find threads asking how to be an alpha male. Critics of the Hall might note that this would seem to be contraindicated in a self selected forum for alpha males, but this is an impartial article.

Quite a few threads rapidly descent to [[tits or GTFO]] which may be the manliest thing that actually happens on this forum.  That and pics of naked [[azn]] chicks.

== Famous Threads ==

Some of the more famous threads are "Who is the manliest homosexual?" "Manly morning," in which members are encouraged to examine and [[Epic Toilet Story|comment]] on their morning [[shit]], and endless fapping over [[Ronald Reagan|Zombie Reagan]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Ahnohld]], [[Justin Bieber|Rob Halford]] of [[Judas Priest]] and [[PeeWee Herman]].  Also, there are threads on [[guns]] where members wank about their substitute penises in a grasp for manhood, while spending a lot of time going [[off topic]] about [[sheep]], [[sheep|sailors]] and lube.

==Kaffir==
After the word [[nigger]] was used [[at least 100]] times, someone suggested it might hurt their [[fail|internet credibility]]. They then switched to the word "kaffir" as a secret code for "nigger." This brilliant move allows them to be secretly racist without anyone figuring it out.  Likewise, [[Mexicans]] are discreetly known as [[beaners]].
