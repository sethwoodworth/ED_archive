Victim loop
[[Image:Ddbook1 cover large.jpg|thumb|The perfect set up for a victim loop]]
The Victim Loop is not so much a [[Flame War]] in of itself, but a technique used in a Flame War.

Essentially, this is a fail-safe device to ensure that your [[lol-cow|victim]] will never cease to come up with the [[lulz]]. After all, who wants to set up a perfectly good target if they're just going to shut down at the first moment?

The answer, of course, is nobody.

==Background==

# Prima has targeted Secunda. Secunda is the [[Perfect Victim]] in every sense of the term.
# Prima chooses <s>her</s> [[No girls on the internet|his]] method of attack. In this example, let us presume that she choses to use the [[Inane Flame]] style. She's obviously a clever Flame Warrior.
# Prima flames Secunda and extracts many [[lulz]].
# Secunda begins to catch on to the fact that she is being milked like a big, fat cow. Mooooooooo.
# Secunda begins to pull out of the Flame War, despite its efficacy.
# OH NOEZ!!! What will Prima do??
# ?????
# PROFIT

==Initiation==

# Prima makes an open post on her LJ or an open comment on somebody else's LJ where Secunda is sure to find it. The post/comment will gloat that Secunda has become the [[Perfect Victim]] and is being used as Prima's plaything. It dehumanizes Secunda into becoming a cheap source of entertainment.
# Secunda will instantly set about defending themselves.
# Prima merely needs to use dehumanizing imperative verbs like 'perform' or debasing metaphors such as 'wind-up toy' and 'puppet' to continue the Victim Loop.

==Result==

# If Prima maintains the Victim Loop by continually dehumanizing Secunda as a cheap source of [[lulz]], Secunda will always defend herself regardless. Secunda will always attempt to show that she's better than being little more than Prima's cheap source of [[lulz]] by being Prima's cheap source of [[lulz]]. It's a crazy system.
# Secunda can only save herself by being a better Flame Warrior than Prima. If Prima is using the [[Inane Flame]] technique, this will be difficult, if not impossible.
