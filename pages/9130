'''Wonk!''' is short for “Wonk, Wonk, Wonk”, which in turn is short for “Wonk, Wonk, Wonk, you sound like Charlie Brown's teacher”, it means “I have no interest in what is coming out of your [[dumb]] fucking mouth, also nobody else here has any interest in what you are saying and we all hope you die!” only slightly more sugar coated.

The insult can be found in the movie Adventures Of Ford Fairlane, and although it's not as widely used as the related insult [[STFU]], it is popular on at least two whole [[forum]]s.
