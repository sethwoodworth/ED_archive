'''The 4th of July''' is one of several [[United States]] [[9/11|holidays]] created to whip up [[masturbation|patriotic American feelings]] and remind the rest of the world that they better not [[Gangbang|fuck]] with us. Also known as [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air|Independence Day]], it was originally started by a [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy|small gang of terrorists]] because they hated the civilized and cordial British way of life, with its incessant tea and crumpets routine and loose talk about abolishing [[niggas|slavery]]. Since then, the 4th of July has become an [[Retro|endearingly]] fetishized [[goatse|annual]] occasion for people to dump money into [[China]] for fireworks and party supplies, allowing us to have the parades, picnics, and sex parties that make the USA the [[Jews|world]]’s most admired nation.

In modern [[America]]n 4th of July celebrations, every other person but [[you]] is barbecuing delicious burgers surrounded by family and friends in the backyards of their [[rich and beautiful|perfect suburban homes]]. You, meanwhile, are sitting [[dying alone|alone]] in a rented basement studio apartment on a chair stained with tears and semen, playing [[World of Warcraft]] in a room lit only by your computer monitor.

==History==
For most of the USA's existence, citizens celebrated 4th of July in traditional and rather boring ways. Year after year, decade after decade, very little changed in the cuisine, the family activities, and the fireworks display. Children symbolically set fire to toy Indian wigwam villages, and civic leaders and politicians made speeches that brought pride to all American hearts.

Something in the national spirit changed, however, after [[The Spanish Inquisition|World War II]]. With the influx of the millions of [[Jews]] who had escaped the [[Holocaust denial|Auschwitz]] ovens, American culture became much more vulgar and cheapened, [[liberal|filled with coarse language, promiscuity and violence]]. All of this, of course, [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion|had been planned long ago]].

==The reality==
Most [[America|Amerifags]] would have you believe that their defeat over the [[Britain|Britfags]] was [[pwnt|all encompassing]] and lulz. However, what they fail to realize is that it was actually the [[Irony|French]] who bailed them out, while the [[Retard|True American PATRIOTS]] played fancy dress as native savages and [[Autism|threw some tea in a river]], presumably under the impression that removing their tea would render them as powerless as Popeye without his spinach, much to the embarrassment of [[Europe|the civilized world]].

==The bright side==
The new coarseness and vulgarity were not necessarily a bad thing, and with it came plenty of opportunities for experimenting with [[drugs]] and [[Bestiality|sexuality]]. As America's foremost holiday, the 4th of July began to personify the country's new outlook and approach to all kinds of strange and risky behavior. For example, [http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=%22bottle+rocket%22+ass&hl=en shooting fireworks out of one's ass] on the 4th of July became a very popular kind of stunt among [[Attention Whore|teenagers]]. Wild, patriotic orgies became the holiday norm for young adults, while the older set drank themselves into the familiar [[Hangover|alcoholic stupor or rage]].

==The future of 4th of July==
Most people agree that 4th of July is much more interesting and fun now than it was in years gone by, and while there is still some danger of [[Mexicans|Cinco de Mayo freaks and criminals]] overwhelming the nation, it seems reasonably certain that the party, in this case, is just going to get crazier.
