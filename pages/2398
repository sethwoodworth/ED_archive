This is about the side effects and bonuses that come from being a werejohncandy.

Very useful for all those first timers out there.

{{frame|One day in 1981 me and John Candy swapped bodies for the entire week to see whose life is harder. When John was stressing about how hard it is being him, I disagreed by saying...."John you've got the easiest job in the whole damm world, you just get paid to lay around, eat and sleep and be very kindly and jolly."

John said "It's a lot harder than it looks."

I replied..."No it isn't. That's easy peasy lemon squeezie! Anyone can do that, even me."

John quipped..."Oh really? Then we'll just see about that... I'll tell you what, we'll switch bodies to see which one of us has it the hardest."

"Oh alright, but just for a week." I sighed.

So we did...

And i've got to admit that being John Candy is a lot easier and more fun that I thought it would be..

I get to lay around and eat alot...how cool is that?

I'm not sure if we ever swapped back though.. }}
