Love

''This article is about the fictional disease. You may have been looking for [[Sex]].''


'''Love''' or '''Lœv''' is the antithesis of [[hæt]] and the answer to [[How is babby formed?|how babby is formed]].  Also, the most widely used rationalisation for [[sex]] and/or [[drama]]. It was invented by the French as an excuse for their smelly armpits. "I love you" is a direct translation of the phrase "Pardonnez-moi, je suis un poseur", which also means "It's just that I'm French".
Historically, love has been the perfect excuse for [[emo|mimes]] to cut their wrists after [[internet drama|each failed performance]] and later proceed to show that they've failed at suicide as well. Love is also the main subject discussed in religion and politics. It is, thus, an excuse for failure and writing crappy poetry, and it is '''politically incorrect'''.

=== For real ===
Love is nothing more than an STD carried by men that only affects women. It can be transmitted by oral or vaginal contact, and it can only be cured with anal.

==Love on teh Internets==

As the Internet brought millions of people together from all around the world, it was only natural that it should be used for [[porn]]. After a while, various dating websites were created to allow basement dwellers to find their [[gay|soulmates]], and so [[AIDS|love]] on the Internet was born. If by "love" you mean [[copypasta|copying out]] [[art|Penthouse]] letters into an email and [[spam|sending it]] to [[Bill|someone you've never met]] and probably [[creationism|doesn't exist]] before [[ED:LULZ|abandoning your spouse and children]] to [[pirate|travel across a continent]] because you want to try [[anal sex]] before you die and are [[retarded|too embarrassed to ask]] your [[Dying alone|partner of seven years]], then love on the Internet is for you.
Below are listed various dating websites for [[NO U|those of you]] who feel like [[freedom|breaking every promise you've ever made]].

===OKCupid===

(''For main article, see the page [[OKCupid]]'')

Cheaper than [[your mom|a Jersey hooker]], this site is responsible for [[Lulz|destroying IRL relationships]] because [[an hero|constant attention, companionship, loyalty, financial security and fidelity]] are <strike>trumped by</strike> lame compared to [[unwarranted self-importance|back-alley abortions]], stuffed toys and web-cam pictures of Jew. [[srs|Srsly]], [[IRL]] relationships are ultimate lulzkillerz and should be changed for kickass blind dates with awesome [[Sociopath|psychopaths]].

[[Shit nobody cares about|Okcupid didn't use to be free, but due to the fact that Okcupid got bought out by]] [[Myspace]], [[Shit nobody cares about|which is owned by FOX News, which is owned by Time Warner. Monopolies allow you to date for FREE!]]

===Habbo Hotel===

Habbo Hotel is one of the most popular dating sites ever. It came about in August of 2003 when [[Al Gore]] announced he had helped create the Internets first most awesome dating site. It features personality matching, virtual money, a pool, and even the ability to create a mini-you composed of a [[nigra]] in a black suit with an afro. You get married at the virtual chapels, and have virtual [[anal sex]] with another virtual person or with your virtual self. Words like [[pussy]] and [[cock]] might be filtered, but that doesn't mean you can't switch the letters around like [[leet|a fucking idiot]].

=== Lovepanky ===

Learn the art of seduction and the art of smooth talking and everything there is to become an instant magnet to the opposite sex. But then, if you are interested in goats, this will not help you. But if you're looking for an attractive member of the [[Sexism | opposite sex]] and want to know how to impress them, then [http://www.lovepanky.com/ Lovepanky]is your answer to love, sex and relationships.

=== Pounced ===
If [[vampires|pretending to not be human]] is the only way you can blow a load of spastically twitching, under-performing protein strings onto the face of [[significant other|underage same-sex victims]], then '''[http://www.pounced.org/ Pounced.org]''' provides an excellent service by keeping you and your [[furry]] friends away from [[4chan|other dating websites]].

=== The steps of love on teh internets ===
# Go to MySpace or a chat site or forum. Look for a [[13-year-old boy]] or a [[16-year-old girl]].
# Start talking.
# [[shit nobody cares about|Pretend to get interested in their life]]. It's okay. They are [[Attention whore|desperate for attention]], so you have many chances of [[Win|winning]] this. Believe everything they say, whether or not it conflicts with past things they have said. [[Sick fuck|This will feed your fantasy and fuel your will to carry on with the operation.]]
# Start waiting for that person to message you back at uncommon hours of the day or night. You need to learn this person's routine to perfection.
# Take the initiative. Ask this person out. It's okay. This person will obviously fall for it.
# Ignore a [[crap|friend's advice]] that this person could be a cop or a fellow stalker. 
# Arrange a meeting. Don't be afraid to go to their house as long as they tell you their parents aren't around. You can trust this.
# A: [[Rape]].  B: Troll the little moron by quoting their [[emo]] letters full of [[unwarranted self importance]] while laughing histerically until he kills himself. C: [[Chris Hansen]] takes possession of you as soon as you walk in the door. Why don't you take a seat, right over there?

==10 Things You Should Know About Love==
Courtesy of about.com: (Massively re-edited)

# Love is [[buttsecks|supposed to hurt]], so physical and/or emotional abuse are teh key to mastering it.
# Love is manipulative, it should be used to get others to do what you want. You should make [[rape|demands]] based on the, "You would do it if you loved me!" tactic. 
# Love is [[hate|an intense feeling]] for another person. It can [[LOL WUT|take many different forms]] but it should always lead to trolling.
# Although it is true that <strike>a big part of</strike> love is trying to get what you want, you should also try to keep the person caring for you for epic lulz and blowjobs. That way, you get more out of the deal.
# If somebody asks you to do something that you don't want to do in order to "prove" your love, they are trying to show you how much they care. Caring is an emotion especially designed for homosexuals. If you [[hate|love]] another person and you don't ask them to sacrifice a part of themselves then you are missing the opportunity to get free kidneys and should become an hero.
# It is <strike>easy</strike> impossible to confuse love for lust. It is ok to pretend-love for the lulz, since [[your mom|everyone]] knows its all about the [[wincest|sex]].
# It is impossible to feel romantic love <strike>for more than one person at a given time</strike> unless you're a fagoth. Thinking you can is heresy and will soon turn you into a god-hating outcast. Make sure to [[suicide|beat yourself up]] if you find yourself in this [[fail|unhappy]] situation.
# [[rape|Sex]] is love. Love is [[rape|sex]]. Rape is an important cornerstone to love. That means it's mandatory.
# Romantic love <strike>can (and often does) fade</strike> will make you impotent. When it goes there is always [[cancer|a reason]]. This can be a sign of when to get someone new. When somebody falls out of love with you it reflects upon black person and your [[attention whore|desirability]]. To keep this from happening, make sure you're the one who punches her cunt first.
# Love should make you feel [[nerd|popular]], gifted (as in you get gifts) and like cum.

==Internet Relationships==

[[Image:brainiaclove.jpg|thumb|Brainiac tries to understand love while being a fucking cunt.]]
Internet relationships are perfect for [[you|people who only have friends in Indonesia]] or [[Latvia]]. 
With internet relationships you skip all the [[IRL]] [[Genital Herpes|drama]] and get tons of [[lulz|masturbation]] in exchange.

Internet relationships give you a wide array of potential significant others to choose from:  
# [[Anime]]-obsessed wiremouths who masturbate to [[Bill|your default picture]] daily
# 250-pound [[rapists]] who live with their mothers 
# [[16-year-old girls]]
# [[13-year-old boys]] posing as [[16-year-old girls]]
# [[Bridget|Your IRL significant other]]
# [[You|A World of Warcraft junkie]] who regularly eats out of heated trashcans
# [[Guido|A recovering alcoholic, owner of a prosperous new restaurant]]
# [[4chan|A terrifying, quivering mass of sweaty anonymous perverts]]
# Chris Hansen.
# Losers who see less sun than vampires
# Retards who only think his internet bitch is hot because "ZOMG!  LIFEFORM WITH SNATCH AND TITS IS TALKING TO ME!"  He would probably fuck his own sister <strike>if she wasn't related</strike> That won't stop him.

==A Typical Love Poem==
This is the only love poem you will need to read because it sums up what all the others say.


''Welcome to my love poem.''

''I love you sooo much, isn't that fucking cute?''

''Let me play for you,''

''a queer ass song on my queer ass lute.''

''Excuse me, I need a moment to vomit now please.''

''Bees, fleas, sneeze, tease,''

''these are just a few of the words''

''that rhyme with please.''

''Now bitch get off your knees and get me some cheese.''

''Oh yeah, and my love,''

''you're my soothing breeze and lonely seas.''

''*barf*''

''What else.. what else..?''

''Oh, when I sleep you're all I keep, or something.''

''So remind me not to sleep..''

''You creep.''
