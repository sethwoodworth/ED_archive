Rakuhana
Forum.rakuhana.org is the latest place for the leftovers of [[Endless Online]] to hang out. Born on 13th July 2009 by Administrators Zenpher and Alex 

It doesn't quite compare to the [[lulz]] that the members once endured on the older forums but is a perfectly fine substitute for now that still consists of [[Internet Tough Guys]], [[Camwhores]] and [[Trolls]] [[Image:Rakuhana.png|thumb|Fiery Pits of Hell]]
The difference between these and the older forums are that these are moderated, have multiple forum sections and constantly updated with new software and ideas.

==The Staff==

*'''Zenpher''' - ''Professional Broseph and the brains behind the entire operation. A smiley happy Bald guy'' 
*'''Alex''' - ''Second hand but just as important, has a problem with overcompensating his intelligent posts giving him a smug vibe''
*'''Console''' - ''Our 2M0X1 specialist who overlooks the forums from Base, keeping us safe and secure. '''FROCK FORCE!'''
''
*'''Emerwen''' - ''Cold hearted and very judgmental. Tends to dislike everyone cept' a small portion of the community, although thought as the most active on the boards''
*'''Prodigy''' - ''The Scottish play toy, always fun to poke jokes at or write into hysterical scenarios'' 
*'''Stricklandxx''' - ''Our quiet mod who rarely lifts a finger. Friendly fella that needs to stop dying his hair black''
*'''Lycoris''' - ''Semi active and opinionated. Dating a Mexican scammer who used the game as a form of income'' 
*'''Sparra''' - ''Forum clown, fun loving guy who comes out with the most [[random]] crap who can do no wrong''
*'''Titan''' - ''Resident Artist with an eye for creating awesome signatures''

==Logseux aka Blousie==

Miss Kathryn Lockley-Brown. Had once fled the older forums after having her naked photo's being exposed to the online community. After 3-4 years of hiding she reemerged on [[Image:Yeptheyreforyou.jpg|Whoops|thumb]]Rakuhana under the name Logseux and at first attempted to hide her true identity although it were obvious to many. Her posts were interesting but consisted mainly of regurgitated [[R9k]] ramblings with her own personal twist. She posted many photo's which after a rather exposing thread on [[The Chemo That Is Curing /b/]] lead to the revealing of them being fake in an attempt to promote her beauty amongst the forum [[white knights]] and cure her personal insecurity. She even went to the trouble of editing her stupid [[Newfags can't triforce]] tattoo onto the photo

Unfortunately she also went through a stage of Art theft trying to make herself edgy, artsy and cool by using some very obscure pieces. The owners of said Art weren't pleased but no action was taken accept for a subtle hint that the mods knew that she recognized and refrained from posting more. Since the exposure of her fake pictures she has since not returned to the forum again and we have had an Alt under the name of her current, younger boyfriend (Logsi - Joshua Brown-Martin) posting revealing information about her and their relationship such as her purchasing anti wrinkle cream at the age of 22 and living in subsidized housing. She's not as pretty as one thinks when she doesn't have time to pose, adjust lighting and photoshop herself

==Deviants aka AzureMaiden==

Otherwise known as Crystal Jackson, appeared on the forums May 12, 2010 and from then on grown herself the largest group of [[haters]] anyone has seen due to her consistent ramblings of [[Christianity]], [[Spam]] and nonsensical paragraphs of [[crap]]. She has a current ongoing feud with moderator Emerwen who is not tolerant of her stupidity and took it upon herself to find out all the intimate details of Crystal's personal life [[Image:Deviants1.jpg|thumb| The 'special one']].It became apparent that Crystal had attended a school for those who suffer from [[Autism]] in Arizona which suddenly explained her retarded ways on the forums. It was also later found out that she is in fact 25 years old and not somewhere around the teens as one would think when reading her posts


Crystal seems to spend her time making [[shit]] pixel clothing based off the old game, involving herself in online money making schemes such as pyramid programs (as she is unable to find a proper job due to her intelligence level), writing pointless blogs expressing information she has no actual understanding of and saving pictures of Moderator Emerwen due to her obsessive crush on her. [[Image:StellaDress.png‎|thumb|Example of her crap Pixel skills]]She was recently banned for a month from the forum due to posting porn and it is expected many are eagerly awaiting her reappearance after laughing at the results Emerwen put forth. For example Crystal's mother Deanna Jackson who works at Walmart cleaning toilets and has the grammatical skills that of a 2 year old

Favoutites amongst her Mother's spelling mistakes were:

*Think = Thank
*Stupped = Stupid
*Aman = Amen
*Christen = [[Christian]] (She can't even spell her own faith)

Her mother is basically an uneducated [[Hick]] that has moved her daughter around the country on multiple occasions possibly due to family fall outs or just general hatred from local neighbors. They now currently reside in [[Missouri]] in their little plastic bag windowed house
