Easter egg

An '''Easter Egg''' is the [[Chocolate Rain|chocolate]] round (well, [[pedantic|oval]]) thing that is traditionally given to [[children|kids]] around Easter, which they promptly proceed to [[NOM NOM NOM]] on.

On the [[Internets]] and in computing in general and even [[old media|elsewhere]], an '''Easter Egg''' is a hidden thing waiting to be found in a form of media... for clarity, the official Easter Egg website defines it as "hidden feature or [[win|novelty]] that the [[programmer]]s have put in their [[software]]". Most [[NORP]]s don't know that these things even exist, and that the so-called professionals (who made [[Microsoft Office|teh softwarez that people use]] for [[serious business]]) like all [[asspie]]s need a little [[batshit insane|eccentricity]] in their lives, so they add [[gay|quirky]] little features in every fucking piece of software they make.

Whilst you could almost expect Easter Eggs in [[video game]]s, when most [[Microsoft]] products have them, you may start to think that something [[weird|strange]] is going on. Also, many Easter Eggs feature [[USI|a list of credits to the programmers who wrote the program]], because they don't get recognition from those who use the software because [[nobody cares]].

==Easter Eggs on the Webz==
Websites can also include Easter Eggs, even though, like most Easter Eggs, this is just pointless [[faggotry]]. Over 90% of the time this is usually a [[not funny|comical]] or [[fail|ironic]]  [[404]] page that is only ever found by [[geek]]s who actually spend their time typing in directories that don't exist on every website they find.   

The other [[Doing_it_wrong|40%]] of the time, it's the [[Konami]] code. Because developers like nothing better than thinking they're seasoned gamers to try and justify their career (which turned out totally not [[awesome]] and kinda devoid of killer [[robot]]s).

The website [http://www.eeggs.com/ eggs.com] has [[over 9000]] listings of Easter Eggs, in "[[software]], [[music]], [[movie]]s and [[moar|more]]". The website allows users to rate each Easter Egg in terms of how [[awesome]] (or not) they are, from [[win]] to outright [[fail]]. Sometimes the techniques produce something crap, and other times it is something quite win. Very rarely though do they produce [[lulz]].

[[some argue|Their definition]] of an Easter Egg is that it is an intentionally included, [[maddie|hidden]], not a [[virus]] or trojan, [[provision for the disabled|accessible to everyone]], [[orgasm|enjoyable]], and put there for [[shit nobody cares about|personal reasons]].

Microsoft used to include Easter Eggs in their products, but stopped doing so in the early 2000s because they were [[pwnt]] by new [[law]]s against such [[bullshit]] being included in such widely-used software. They had mini-video games in them that were like, kinda, unwinnable and pointless.
