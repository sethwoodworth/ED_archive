A [[bully]] is a person who throws his weight around to frighten weaker people into giving them money/sweets/shares in [[Microsoft]]. Due to everyone on the internet being [[fat]], E-bullies have to use other means to get what they want, these means include shallow threats, threats, death threats, threats to expose a person's sexuality, legal threats, more threats and threats.

E-Bullies are often mistaken for trolls, although the main difference between the two is that [[troll]]s know that the Internet is serious fucking business, also E-bullies tend to have an agenda.
