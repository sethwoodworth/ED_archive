[[File:Aperture Science Portal Wanted Ad.png|thumb|There WILL be cake!]]
<s>'''''Hole-Jumper'''''</s> '''''Portal''''', is a game set in the ''Half-Life'' universe, and is almost as enjoyable as ''[[Battletoads]]'', as [[you]] cannot go five minutes on [[b/|/b/]] or [[v/|/v/]] without seeing that goddamn Companion Cube. The game centers around <del>Chell</del> Mai Kiff, an [[Hispanic|Ugly asian]] woman trapped within Aperture Science Enrichment Center, most likely because she refused to make her faithful husband, Gordon Freeman, [[Blowjob|a turkey and ham sammich]]. She's then given the ability to [[Divide by zero|bend the space-time continuum]], and decides to [[GTFO]]. There is clear evidence that at least one of the developers of the game is a /b/tard, as the entire game is basically the most complex and kick-ass [[delicious cake]] puzzle, as often found on /b/. The game's ending was pretty frustrating to some... just laying there half-dead, seeing your nemesis' parts falling from the sky... with the screen turning black. Although the ending song crearly states that [[Awesome|GLaDOS]] was [[Meme|still alive]] by the ending of the game, some [[Retard|fans]] went on creating their own theories for what happened to her and what would be it's future.

UPDATE: The ending of the game has been updated, now players won't get all butthurt over a frustrated black-fading-screen ending. The escort bot drags you away but before, he relay you these words: '''Thank you for assuming the Party Escort Submission Position'''.

==Portal 2==
Not even released yet, but [[Valve]] stated that it takes time some [[At least 100|hundreds of years after]] the events of Portal. Already making [[Fangirls|everyone]] cum in anticipation. It will feature [[Sex|Co-Op]] mode, where you can [[Rape|help]] your friends, by controling one of the following [[Extreme Advertising|fucking awesome]] robots: A modified core and a modified turret ([[Shit no one cares about|Each containing it's own 2 portals! Blue/Teal {Core} and Orange/Red {Turret}]]).

There's a continuity flaw: In the end of Portal, you're outside of Aperture Laboratories with GLaDOS' parts scattered around there and, in the Portal 2 trailer you can clearly see that GLaDOS is back into her own arena, only [[PETA|nature-infested]]. She also got some updates to her model, which makes us believe that something took her back to her arena and repaired her.

Additionally, players who pre-order this game [[Never|when it comes out]] will receive an [[Gay|awesome]] item in everyone's favorite [[Team Fortress 2|online hat simulator]].

==Portal: The Flash Version==
For people too poor to afford a gaming PC, [[Playstation 3]], or an [[Xbox 360]], or for people who are too Jew to spend  [[money|$20]] fucking dollars on Valve's ''Orange Box'' (and were too [[retard|fucktarded]] to snag it while it was FREE), there's an [http://portal.wecreatestuff.com unofficial flash version] which is about a hundred times more boring than the original, and completely lacks GLaDOS' commentary and any traces of dark humor. Because of this game, and because of how easy it is to make [[screenshot|screenshots]], forums were packed with solution requests upon its release, because some people like the gratification of solving puzzles without doing any of the actual puzzle solving. The only people who request solutions now are [[slowpoke|slowpokes]] who deserve to be ignored. If you want to, for whatever reason, you can [http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&AppId=400&cc=US buy] the 3D game off [[Steam]]'s website for $20. The Flash version has everything you could want, except with fewer "'''[[Cake]] is a lie'''" Easter eggs.
Or you can pirate it, Demonoid is your friend.
For increased [[faggot|faggotry]], [http://portalmaps.wecreatestuff.com/ its levels have been ported into the original game] being titled '''''Portal: Still Alive'''''. It IS endorsed by Valve, being the maps uploaded onto the game itself.

==Portal Prelude==
Some nerd fanboy decided to create some maps [[Raptor Jesus|and saw it was good]]. Then he decided to write a story about it. It fits just before the events that happened in '''''Portal'''''. You play as a [[Typical|woman]] (but not Chell!) and you must endure fucking [[Riddle Time|complex tests]] forced onto you by humans (not GLaDOS this time). When you reach the end of the game, GLaDOS goes [[Batshit Insane]] once turned on and kills everyone. Making an escape, you encounter a cloning station where you can see other clones of yourself, get [[butthurt]] and confront GLaDOS. In the endgame you insert the [[Penis|Morality Core]] in GLaDOS and she starts flooding everything with the neurotoxin. You blank out and the last thing you see is [[Divide by zero|Chell]] dragging you [[Joseph Fritzl|somewhere]].

When the idiots at [http://www.gamesradar.com/us/xbox360/game/features/article.jsp?articleId=20071207115329881080&releaseId=2006071916221774024&sectionId=1003&pageId=20071207115724980042 some shitty website] were hired to write an article about ''Portal'', rather than do an actual review ([http://www.gamesradar.com/xbox360/portal/review/portal/a-2007100911151747210694/g-2006071916221774024 Here's the actual review, as written by GamesRadar]), they decided to over-analyze and, in some cases, completely make shit up to discuss why the first person shooter was not only revolutionary to gaming, but to Feminazi society. [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|In response, some /b/tards completely devoid of the fact that this is a satirical article]] got [[butthurt]]. Not to be confused with a [[feminism|feminist]], a Feminazi is usually a bat-shit insane, [[lie|bra-burning]] cunt who believes men are the reason for [[Furry|everything that is wrong with the world]], and would like to have everyone with a penis killed or enslaved forever. The name of the Feminazi in question is [[Fag|Joe McNeilly]], who is most likely a dude who only wrote this to reap his $20 interweb salary and maybe impress some [[Slut|groggy bar-maiden]]. 

{{quote|<small><small>Warning: The text you are about to read contains [[Bullshit|heady intellectual discourse]] and is not recommended for anyone made queasy by the discussion of feminist film theory or psychoanalytical signifiers.</small></small>|Joe McNeilly, [[Pretentiousness|warning idiots of his superior genius]].}}

[[File:Portal Tattoo.jpg|thumb|Why would [http://vegasama.deviantart.com/art/Portal-Tattoo-s-180973083?q=&qo= someone] do this?]]
Joey argues that ''Portal'' is "a femi[[Nazi]] critique of the first person shooter," and thereafter, he breaks out the ol' thesaurus and starts firing off loads of SAT-worthy words, machine-gun style. The gist of what he says is that the mainstream, retarded, male-oriented first person shooters, such as ''Call of Duty 4'', are all grotesquely violent examples of militarism, and because men don't have the [[Bullshit|superior intellect of women]], we solve our problems by [[War|mindlessly pumping each other full of lead]] and [[9/11|blowing up buildings]] - you know, the cool way of solving problems. Usually in first person shooters, the guns are all [[Penis|phallic]] symbols of masculinity, but the weapon in ''Portal'' is a vagina-cannon that shoots metaphysical vaginas and rainbows to outwit masculine enemies. Joey also says the sentries have "boyish voices," despite being [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1127708/fullcredits#cast voiced by Ellen McLain], and sounding like genderless babies. Nevertheless, these [[Lie|CLEARLY MASCULINE]] turrets try to deceive Chell with friendly chatter and then brutally murder her; because men are evil and enjoy deceiving and killing defenseless, intelligent women.

{{quote|<small><small>The power of the feminine overcomes aggression without the use of force.</small></small>|Joe McNeilly, after bashing a turret's CPU in with a block and dumping it several stories down into a vat of acid.}}

[[Image:Companioncube15.png|thumb|left|The [[rape|ultimate gift]] for faminazi dykes.]]
The straw that broke the camel's back was when Joey started hating on the Weighted Companion Cube's [[LOL WUT|blatant masculinity]]. Branding the Companion Cube as a burdensome anchor that slows down Chell's revolutionary breakout, Joey is clearly one of the [[idiots]] who completely missed the point of the Cube's awesomeness. Making shit up, he says "GLaDOS encourages Chell to develop emotional attachment to the Cube" even though GLaDOS says the exact opposite, and the developer's commentary claims you're supposed to avenge the Companion Cube's death by giving GLaDOS the same fiery fate. Oh yeah, and GLaDOS is man's attempt at the perfect mother figure wrought from cold, hard science. In the first published draft of the essay, Joe made up more shit, claiming that GLaDOS called the WCC a "he," but when readers called him on his bullshit, he removed it. Unfortunately, [http://www.gamesradar.com/us/xbox360/game/features/article.jsp?articleId=20071207115329881080&releaseId=2006071916221774024&sectionId=1003&pageId=20071207115724980042 the rest of the essay is still intact.] It's also worth noting that during development, the Weighted Companion Cube was the generic weighted cube found in other levels. The level was originally titled "The Cube Run," and it didn't have any mention of the lovable, life saving box or any euthanasia awaiting it at the end. It was not until testing, in which the majority of testers left the stupid cube behind, that Valve decided to stick a heart on it and have GLaDOS talk about it the whole time.  
[[Image:Portal feminism.jpg|thumb|Above: A generic FPS. Below: women walk through wall vaginas. (Note, in the Half-Life universe, aliens dominate society)]]


{{quote|<small><small>Ultimately, Chell incinerates the Weighted Companion Cube, symbolizing a mental unburdening from the need for approval from a father figure.</small></small>|Joe McNeilly, [[Bullshit|making perfect sense]].}}

It's particularly hilarious how all the dorks who claim things like ''Doom'', which is based around saving the universe from demons and Hell, are masculine/anti-woman/patriarchal while they all seem to ignore ''Metroid'' and its main character Samus Aran, who is a chick that is trying to save the universe from Space Pirates and parasitic vampire bowling balls. Same shit, different gender. Of course, Mr. McNeilly sees the [[Truth|completely fucking genderless and inanimate]] Companion Cube as a [[Lie|CLEARLY MASCULINE]] father figure who only burdens Chell and slows her down, so the feminist tendency to grossly overthink things and find a bunch of bullshit symbolism in something as dull and plain as a metal box with a heart on it is a clear sign of [[Retarded|extreme mental instability]]. The same dumbass would probably see Samus Aran's metal powersuit as some kind of manly oppressive device designed by a patriarchal regime to hide Samus' feminine titties and vajayjay and suffocate her blooming womanhood through a symbolic steel shell/prison with a phallic laser cannon, despite the fact that it was created by birds (fun fact: the birds probably WERE a patriarchal regime). And of course, it's completely unobvious that Samus is a chick, even though in ''Metroid Prime'' you can see a clearly feminine set of eyes through her visor and you hear a chick grunt in pain when you get hit and all the Pirate data and Chozo data that you find refers to you as a "she".

=="The cake is a lie"==

Shortly after the game was released, about twenty million brain-starved wannabe-hipster gamers started spamming the shit out of ''Portal'' references practically everywhere even vaguely associated with [[geek]] culture. Along with "Still Alive" and the Companion Cube, this resulted in one of the most gratingly awful catch phrases ever to take a giant shit across the internet: "the cake is a lie".

Yes, we know: the cake is a fucking lie. We've all heard it about four hundred billion times. The joke is so thoroughly dead, it actually kills [[lulz]] every time it's repeated.

I went on a second date with a chick I really liked tonight. At the end of the date, I didnât take any chance I had to kiss her. So we were driving back home in separate cars (she lives close to me, but she was came from a friends house to meet me at the restaurant) I realized that I was a dumb ass for not taking the chance. I decided to make a chance and be really spontaneous. I was going to race ahead to her house, wait for her drive up, run out of the car and kiss her. So I pull the corner to see her house and SHE THOUGHT WITH PORTALS! She was already there, out of the car, and the garage door was closing! Despite me being ahead of her the whole time!

So I ask, /b/, how do -I- think with portals?

==Copypasta: Female [[FPS]]==
{| cellspacing="4" 
|- valign="top"
|width="100%" style="border: 10px solid #FFFFEE; color:#800; background: #fca"|
Reasons why ''Portal'' is the female version of an FPS:
<br/>
1. The main character is female.<br/>
2. The main villain is female.<br/>
3. Your only weapon is a gun that shoots...{{wordfilter|text=VAGINA}}s--I mean, space-time tunnel apertures.<br/>
4. The game is based around evasion and manipulation instead of confrontation and domination.<br/>
5. The turrets. They are the exact opposite of a parody of everything women supposedly hate about regular shooting games. Violence, profanity, blood, evil symbolism, chauvinism...the turrets are always polite and apologize even if you kill them. Because everyone is nice in a woman's world.<br/>
6. Just like actual women, the main villain (GLaDOS) is actually powerless to physically do anything to you. The only weapon GLaDOS has is emotional manipulation. Just like women.<br/>
7. The company is called Aperture Science and women have an aperture between their legs.<br/>
8. The game starts and ends with a cute song instead of a bunch of dead people.<br/>
9. The game promises you a reward at the end if you jump through a lot of hoops, and it turns out to be a GREAT BIG FUCKING LIE, YOU STUPID WHORE YOU FUCKING USED ME, ROT IN HELL YOU WORTHLESS CUNT, women have been known to stereotypically act in this manner.<br/>
Finally...<br/>
10. Your only weapon is a gun that shoots {{wordfilter|text=VAGINA}}s.

Anon is legion.

We closed every pool here: DUE TO AIDS

It's hard to overstate this damn infection.

Nigras of EBAUMS.

We do what we must for epic lulz.

For the good of all of us except for those racist mods.

But there's no use trying to resist our pool raids.

You'll just keep on crying till you sink and get AIDS.

And the /b/locking gets done.

And we make a neat run.

From the people who are still online.


I'm not even trolling.

I'm being so helpful right now.

Even though you shouted at and B& me.

And blocked all my IPs.

And extended it. To last. For life.

As they b& I lol'd because I'm spamming DESU at you.

Now these n00bs on HABBO make a target just fine.

So we called for /b/lackup till we got them online.

So I'm glad I got B&.

LOL Catnarok is at hand.

For the people who are still online.


Go ahead and ban me.

I think I will need the un-B& guide.

Maybe you'll find some /b/lackup to help you

Maybe on 4chan? That was a joke HA!HA! Fat chance.

Anyway, this raid is great, It's full of epic and win.

Look at me, still /b/locking when we need moar DESU,

But anon is legion and we're better than you.

When you see the mods run

There is /b/locking to be done.

'Gainst the people who are still online.


And believe me they are still online.

They're banning /b/rothers and they're still online.

They're being RACIST and they're still online.

While you're blogging I'll be still online.

And when they fail I will be still online.

Still online.

Still online.

Now, there are lots of cake recipes out there, but if you want to make a true and original cake, you have to use the ingredients listed in the game. Just hearing the list of ingredients means this is either a very big cake or it's intended to clog arteries. They don't give any directions, so you're on your own there. But here is the transcribed list:

<small><pre>1 18.25oz package chocolate cake mix
1 can prepared coconut pecan frosting
3/4 cup vegetable oil
4 large eggs
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup butter or margarine
1 2/3 granulated sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
Don't forget garnishes such as: 
Fish-head crackers [they can't say "Goldfish" because it's trademarked]
Fish-shaped candies [again, trademark. They can't say Swedish Fish.]
Fish-shaped solid waste
Fish-shaped dirt
Fish-shaped ethylbenzene [that means styrofoam]
Pulled and peeled licorice
Fish-shaped volatile organic compounds and sediment-shaped sediment
Candy coated peanut butter pieces [once again, trademark. They can't say Reese's Pieces], shaped like fish
1 cup lemon juice
Alpha resins (???)
Unsaturated polyester resins [the stuff they use to make fiberglass boats]
Fiberglass surface resins and volatile malted milk impoundments
9 large egg yolks
12 medium geosynthetic membranes
1 cup granulated sugar [that's what they said]
An entry called "How to Kill Someone with Your Bare Hands"
2 cups rhubarb, sliced
2/3 cup granulated rhubarb
1 tablespoon all-purpose rhubarb
1 teaspoon grated orange rhubarb [No, that's not a typo. That's what she said]
3 tablespoons rhubarb on fire
1 large rhubarb
1 cross-borehole electromagnetic imaging rhubarb [A rhubarb/MRI machine?]
2 tablespoons rhubarb juice
Adjustable aluminum head positioner
Slaughter electric needle injector [Again, not a typo]
Cordless electric needle injector
Injector-needle driver
Injector-needle gun
Cranial caps
And it contains proven preservatives, deep penetration agents, and gas and odor control chemicals that will deodorize and preserve putrid tissue. [So basically, formaldehyde]</pre></small>

Of course, despite how great ''Portal'' may have been to the masses, sooner or later it was bound to fall prey (lol) to [[furfags]] across the planet, who managed to find something sexual in a game that contains only a box, security cameras, and a gun in empty grey rooms. Armed with the ability to mercilessly rip apart anything remotely resembling humor and twist it into some disappointing puddle of [[furshampoo]] and [[fail]], [[furfag]]s have beaten and [[rape|raped]] Portal more than a [[yahtzee|red-headed stepchild]].

Other than the inevitable shitfest of furry art , furfags have managed to somehow take the ''Portal'' ending song and twist it into some [[retard|retarded]] [[fail|song]] about furry [[convention|conventions]], [[yiff]], [[CSI]], and other assorted [[fag|faggotry]].

I'm Making A Note Here:
HUGE SUCCESS
It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.
Aperture Science
We do what we must
because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.

But there's no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are
Still alive.

I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And killed me.
And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!
Now these points of data
make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
for the people who are
still alive.

Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else
to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa. . .
THAT WAS A JOKE. HA HA. FAT CHANCE.
Anyway. this cake is great.
It's so delicious and moist.
Look at me still talking
When there's science to do.
When I look out there,
it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
I've experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are
still alive.

And believe me I am still alive.

I'm doing Science and I'm still alive.

I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive.

While you're dying I'll be still alive.

And when you're dead I will be still alive.

STILL ALIVE</pre></small>
