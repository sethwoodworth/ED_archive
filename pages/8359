Theology
[[Image:theologicaldebate.jpg|right|thumb|People enjoy the intellectual stimulation of a heated theological [[debate]].]]
Any word that has the suffix "-ism" that requires severe [[insane|mental]] [[retard]]ation to take seriously. [[IRL]], a lively [[teh]]eological debate leads to riots, thumbscrews, and burnt villages. [[OL]], people cannot slit each other's throats, so they settle for threats and character [[assassination]]. It was established as a discipline [[at least 100 years ago]] when Robo-Stalin created teh earth [[last Thursday]]-which makes as much sense as [[teh]]ology.

==The theology rule of thumb==
Anyone who has ''any'' interest in theology is a [[Fundamentalist|Biblethumper]]. If his/her preaching enters your ears, wash the site '''immediately''' with [[Atheist|Atheism]], and take necessary vitamins, antibiotics and [[pr0n]] to fight the oncoming fit of godliness.

==Typical theological debate [[OL]]==

**"Buddhist practice has to do with loss of self, and this is kind of the idea associated with Tantric sex.  But donâ€™t get me wrong, I am really just a horny son of a bitch." --Stickman
*<b>Against</b> [http://www.chuckpalahniuk.net/community/showthread.php?p=819334 The Official Chuck Palahniuk Forums]
**"Man, I hate buddhists. They keep hitting me with sticks. I ask a simple question and POW, black eye. 'Does J.F.Kennedy have Buddha nature?' Pow. 'Why does the sacred chao say 'mu'?' Pow. 'Why do you keep hitting me with sticks?' Pow. I should become Jehova's Witness... I could probably use the exercise." --XyZy

**"[[God]] has a right to make the rules. Anyway, what you consider to be 'love' is only because the [[devil]] has so twisted your mind and [[emo]]tions that you consider something that God says will damn your soul to [[hell]] as good. We shall see about your contention that there is no God on judgment day. Feel lucky?" --Patriot 
*<b>Against:</b>
**"So basically, some whore cheated on her new husband before he'd even gotten a chance to fuck her, she got pregnant, and as a result of her frantically trying to lie her way out of a [[falcon punch]], we've now got yet another shitty monotheist judaism offshoot. Great." --Yiri

**"Can we count [[Madonna]]? Eventually she's going to drop Kabbalah the way she did Sean Penn. But until then, does she belong on the Challah fame?" --Staff
*<b>Against:</b> 
**"Jews did wtc." --[[Weev]]

===[[Islam|Islamism]]===

===[[Atheist|Atheism]]===
*<b>Against:</b>[http://chud.com/forums/showthread.php?t=90180 The CHUD.com Message Boards -- Atheists Are Assholes]
**"You have a point there. But I think you're assuming I'm atheist just because I'm prejudiced against atheists, and it's confusing my point. I'm not here to defend theists or have a theological debate of any kind. I'm just here to observe, in this 'people think atheists are assholes' thread, that I think a lot of atheists are assholes. Not wrong. Just assholes." --Junior

**"Personally, as an atheist I fail to see the logic behind their being a giant invisible man in the sky who sees everything I do, it's basically some kind of ancient ''[[1984]]'' combined with Lord Of The Rings: a made up fantasy in which everything is visible to a guy that people either hate or fear." --Jonathan
