Brainlesswonder
[[Image:HellBW.jpg|thumb|Brainlesswonder combines his sensitive nature with his photoshop skills]]
{{lj|user=brainlesswonder}}, otherwise known as '''(reply from suspended user)''', has been stirring the [[livejournal]] pot since 2001. He stumbled onto the [[lj]] scene as a confused and married bisexual. He claims to be both a [[e-lawyers|lawyer]] and a welder from Glendale.

He began his [[livejournal]] career in the [[debate]] community. His [[flying pigs]] [[icon]] was the "LuftWaffe" of the [[feminist]] community, eventually leading [[lj_abuse]] to start suspending users just for sporting it. He was a casualty of the great [[feminazi]] [http://www.livejournal.com/community/debate/515022.html war of 2002], and was [[Lj_abuse|perma-banned]] from [[lj]] much to the joy of [http://www.livejournal.com/community/debate/1485188.html?thread=41337732#t41337732 tata sensitive women everywhere]. This ban inspired many [[debate]] users to adopt the flying pigs in protest.  His [[suspended|permaban]] was lifted in 2005, making his suspension the longest recorded in [[lj]] history. His account was suspended again after an alleged [[hacker|hacking]].  

He is a [[sexist]], [[racist]], [[conservative]] bigot that has been witnessed trying to [http://www.livejournal.com/community/the_cutters/207182.html pick up mentally challenged women] in the [[cutter|cutters]] community. He is known to falsify [http://www.livejournal.com/community/bisexual/571423.html?thread=2923039#t2923039 Mark Twain Quotes] so often that people include them in their [http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=omake_don user info].

He once [http://www.livejournal.com/community/debate_classics/92108.html broke livejournal].

He has been [[Dramouted]] on multiple occasions.

== The Suspended Years ==
Being a big fat [[loser]], brainlesswonder continued his assault on [[lj]] under more than a hundred various accounts that were systematically hunted and destroyed by the livejournal abuse team inspiring [http://www.livejournal.com/community/debate/1485188.html contests about his new identity]. His army of [[sock puppet]] journals made eliminating him from a personal journal [http://www.livejournal.com/community/metaquotes/667900.html very difficult]. His crowning achievement is most likely [[kkk_membership]]. He also earned internet stardom as [[homosexual|hell_fudge]] with the infamous "survivors suck" post in which he suggested that rape victims "walk it off" and also "the best 40 bucks I ever spent" which detailed how he battled the inconvenience of [[liberal|protestors]] with his urine. As [[homosexual|jerzeeegrrrrrrl]], he spurred 900 comments of anguish by suggesting that it seemed silly to charge someone with murder for killing a homeless man. All three entries have since been removed by [[lj_abuse]].
