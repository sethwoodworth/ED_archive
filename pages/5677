Necronomicon
[[Image:AngryBook.jpg|thumb|100px|The actual Necronomicon! Seriously! Can be purchased from the Catalyst Studios online store:  http://www.moritorium.com.]]
A fictional book that was entirely the invention of writer [[H.P. Lovecraft]] for use in his horror stories and for [[pwning]] wannabe necromancers. Several [[hoax]] versions of the Necronomicon exist, most notably a grimoire purportedly written by The Mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred ([[Shit nobody cares about|despite the fact that in Arabic, you don't put the morpheme "-ul" before "al-" because it's fucking redundant, and therefore anomalous]]). Lovecraft claimed that [[Bruce Campbell|reading just one paragraph of the Necronomicon would turn a sane man into a gibbering lunatic]]. It is believed that most [[LiveJournal]] users have read the whole thing.

Many deluded [[pagan]]s, practitioners of [[magick]] and [[16 year old girls]] believe the Necronomicon is real. Others will admit that the fakes are fakes but insist that the magic works anyway.

**"That all depends on what you mean by 'the Necronomicon' and by 'real'. --The Arcane Archive

**"Listen boy, this isn't the topic, nor is ANY Necronomicon topic the right place to argue if it is a [[hoax]] or not, start up a new one saying how much you [[hate]] the nec., knowing that you have never tried it, and then, then that would be fine, but stop (not just you, mind you) filling up the nec. threads with your [[boring]] 'it's a hoax' 'It's fake' 'Lovecraft Sux!!' (No man, Lovecraft rox, let's get that straight) ok? Anyways, back to topic, I actually found this copper dinner plate at a garage sale and was gonna use it for the dagger, it was like a buck. The Nec. makes you hunt around a bit and be quite creative." --LucienAscendus

**"Hi. Yeah I would just like to point out (and I'm sure you get this a LOT!) but you people are ignorant and synicl. I personaly don't care what you think about the NECRONOMICON but to post (and I understand this is your site)that it is all a hoax is outragous you could not posibly know unless you did the reserch for your self but is obvious you did not, and you choos to believe everything people tell you to when it's easy to believe. SIMON's work is real and authentic he may not care that you say these things but I and many other people do. we believe in it, not becaus we were all told to but some of us actualy practice Necromancy and it is not an evil [[magick]] but an art of the [[dead]] and a part of our live so I ask you on behalf of all necromancer's (exept the infernal one's) pleas do not judge thing's you have no clue about if you want true answers research it. Thank you." --Orphen
