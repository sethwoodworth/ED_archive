'''Polyamory''' is the act of or ability to [[Rape|love]], in a romantic sense, more than one person. Those who lead a polyamorous sexual life are typically called '''polys''', and most harbor some other [[fetish]], whether it's [[furry]], [[goth]], [[16-year-old girl|sporks]] or [[whatever]].

Polys, like many formerly abused children, often confuse their [[sex]] life with their day-to-day [[lifestyle]] and personality. Polyamory becomes something they ''are'' rather than something they do. Proselytizing polys are the most annoying of all. Poly [[communities]] consist almost entirely of [[loser]]s who identify as polys because they are so pathetic it is the only way they could get laid at all.

As with any made-up misunderstood minority, Polys cement their group by stigmatizing outsiders; thus, in this loser taxonomy, non polys are "moggies" (this is not a term of affection, despite the fact that every goddam batshit poly chick has seventeen cats).  This ingroup/outgroup behavior shows the world they are outsiders and [[Idiot]]s.


==Taunting Polys==
===The dead parrot war of attrition===
The easiest way to enrage a Poly is to refuse to understand what they mean when they proudly announce they are polyamorous: 

(A wee script, works best IRL, but can be adapted for online/chat)

Polly: ...and, so, because I AM POLYAMOROUS...

You: What ? <looks outraged>  <-this is the bait.

Polly: Polyamorous..you see, it means...

You: That's disgusting ! <-this sets the hook

Polly: <grins inwardly, begins smug self indulgent speech on tolerance or some stupid crap> Well, I think that love....

You (LOUDLY): [[Penisbird|WHY IN THE HELL WOULD YOU WANT TO FUCK A PARROT]] !!!!!!!! <-whizzzzzz !  Out goes the line....

Crowd at party: <suddenly staring at poly> Horror! Disgust!

The longer you can misunderstand polyamorous to mean "[[Penisbird|Love of parrots]]" the better.  As you have now stigmatized the poly as an evil zoophile, society will condone you ranting, raving, and generally abusing them at the top of your lungs - remember, [[YOU]] are the victim. Throw in the issue of consent being impossible for animals, and some choice comments like "What?  Do you put crackers on your dick to entice them?"

===Semantics===
Another thing polys hate is when you say they're "swingers". Like all cults, they hope to keep a fresh new perspective on things and prefer to believe that the concept of "having sex with other people" is something they invented in 1998. Call a poly a swinger then listen patiently for 45 minutes while he/she explains the nonexistent differences between the two, then follow up with "So you're swingers, then?".

===Geometry===

True to their ways of using new concepts when old would do, polys likes to compare their [[Clusterfuck|relations]] with overly complex geometrical figures. One of the most cutesy is ''star relations'', i.e. every member is only having relations with two others. Point out to them that a star is geometrically equivalent to the much more boring circle. Ask then why they didn't name their relations after the circle.

===The golden years===
One final way to taunt polys is to ask what they think their lives will be like when they're 70. Do they plan to go play Canasta with other partners? Maybe have a three-way shuffleboard game?

==Hypocrite Polys==

There has been a recent increase in relationships where one person wants to be poly but the other is expected to remain monogamous.  Typically, the woman claims she is "wired that way" and that it feels unnatural for her to only [[fuck]] one person and wants to [[slut|share the love]], yet she can't bear the thought of her man touching anyone else.  This typically ends in [[drama]] for everyone involved.
