== Past Winners ==
*[[User:Ntg85|Ntg85]] - July 2006
:Although a regular contributor for the past eight or so months, as a new admin, Ntg85 didn't know [[wtf|what the fuck]]. Still, she [[cock|stuck it out]], finally overcoming her obstacles and learning how to update her e-mail address (hint: it's under [[Special:Preferences|preferences]]). Now all she has to do is figure out them there fancy blue words in the interweb pages.
*[[User:Tfo|Tfo]] - August 2006
:Tfo popped up in mid-July and has many lulzy edits, but is most famous for [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=upload&user=Tfo&page= uploading many REALLY gross pictures]. Specifically [[:Image:MYSCROTUMISBLEEDINGOOPS.jpg]] and [[:Image:!spidercock.jpg]].

Oh yeah...these two stellar [[EDiots]] have slipped into the ED way so effortlessly, one would swear they were [[Jacknstock|sockpuppets]]. ED salutes you n00bs!
*[[User:Aghar|Aghar]] - August 2007
:Almost definitely another [[Blu Aardvark]] [[sockpuppet]], this newfag has the wiki skeelz to pay the bills. Also managed to get under [[User:Blargh|Blargh's]] skin (and survive the [[genocide|consequences]]) in record time and should get a fucking medal for that alone.
