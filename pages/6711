'''Pyromaniac Guy''' (aka ''pyro'' or ''stan'') is a formerly [[Fat|overweight]] forum troll who has named himself for his so called love of fire.   His posts range from political threads on over to the discussion of female body parts.  In this way, he has [[Basement-dweller|accumulated more than 16,000 posts in under 5 years of time spent on the stileproject forums.]] It has been suggested that pyro has so many posts because he does not bother to read what he is typing and it is because of this that pyro has a distinct posting style.  This posting style involves a lot of typographical errors, transposed lettering, and grammatical mistakes which lead the reader to believe that they have just read something typed out by a retarded second grader.

Lately, [[Sick fuck|pyro]] has changed his typing habits for the better.  Occasionally, an odd mistake will make it into a post, but for the most part, his [[Homosexuality|faggotry]] is much easier to read.

Some of his antics have generated [[Lulz|lulz]] over the years, here is a small sampling of some of the things he has done:


*Underwent a huge reduction of weight.  While no pictures of his former fat self are available at the moment, pyro was a huge fatty with a dirty [[Hippy|Santa Claus beard.]]  In a surprisingly [[AIDS|short period of time, he lost his massive weight]] and became a health nut.  This has led many forum members to speculate whether pyro is in fact more than one person using the same account.  This would also explain the large number of posts he has accumulated in such a very short time.


*Has been known to argue a point in a political thread for upwards of six weeks.

[[Image:Pyro30.png|thumb|175px|center|concept art]]


*Sent '''s33w33d''' a bottle of liquor that contained a cobra.  While this is funny on its own, the resulting lulz were epic:

{{squote|Basically, they just said "Look, we don't know what this is, you can't bring it on the train." So I went back to the office, and dropped it off. Thanks, Pyro, for getting me handcuffed/nearly killed.|s33w33d commenting on the whole mess}}


*Used his credit card and donated enough money to change several forum member’s custom title from the standard “Official Stile Project Whore” to “I want pyro to put it in my butt like whut.”  This donation was somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 dollars.  


*[[Virgin|Married]] a mail order bride


{{squote|crazy, goofy engineer/physicist/entrepreneur/inventor/geek seeks a good time - hasnt quite determined what variables make up the set 'a good time' yet - suggestions welcomed.|pyro on his myspace page}}


*Divorced a mail order bride.  The majority of this article deals with those events.


== '''Mail Order Bride Post''' ==

Pyromaniac guy, ever a intelligent and wise poster, decides to tell his story to the stile project community...What ever could go wrong?  Here follows a brief TL;DR of what happened:

*Pyro marries a total psycho
*Pyro has sex a few times with that total psycho
*The total psycho cheats on him
*The total psycho leaves him
*The total psycho comes back and uses a can of pepper spray on his face
*The total psycho goes to jail

Stan turecki, proof of arrest for grand theft, burglery

Michael Farmer
Mon, 16 Jun 2008 17:52:33 -0700
I paid for a background check on Mr. Stan Turecki, and here is what I found, of
course, tons of files, but the actual arrest and prison sentence are below.
He was in prison from Sept 1995 until November 1996, and he stole more than
$100,000 in this case.
People, we are dealing with a real piece of human crap here, I have got emails
from people in Russia, France, and USA. He owes meteorite dealers and
collectors well over $100,000. I am, compiling a list to present to the Port
Richeypolice department. If this con-man owes you money, let me know, I am
going to shut this guy down.

== Pyro Is Going To Fuck Allie Sin ==
[[Image:Pyroaliesin.jpg|thumb|175px|Look! Another jailbird in pyromaniac guy's sad life.]]
[[Image:Pyroallie7.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Pyro's new girlfriend]]

{{quote|dude, you are becoming a parody of yourself. Make sure this all culminates in a suicide and the rest of us will be happy.|3MTA3 commenting on the whole subject}}

Recently, Pyro has made claims that he has the opportunity to have sex with the porn star/erotic dancer who goes by the name Stephanie Draheim when she is not in her professional capacities.  While in her professional guise, Stephanie goes by the name of [http://www.myspace.com/allie_sin / Allie Sin,] a blank faced, unresponsive whore who fucks average losers when she isn't making money on a porn movie set by fucking 12 men at once.  What Pyro doesn't seem to realize that he has set himself up for total failure no matter what happens.  If he does fuck her, he will have to face scorn of the likes which only the internet can provide and also face the shame of having sloppy seconds of the ultimate kind.  If he doesn't fuck her, he is another lying sack of shit that you find on the internet every day...and he is going to have to face scorn only the likes of which the internet can provide.

Pyro has claimed that the cost for such a tryst will be in the neighborhood of one thousand USD, a sum that most recently was mentioned involving the [[Shamwow|ShamWow guy,]] Vince Schlomi.  Perhaps Pyro should take a lesson from good old Vince and realize that even high class hookers are still human pieces of garbage and that they would rather knife you in the back (or try to bite your tongue off) than actually fuck you for money.  Knowing Pyro, the consensus is that he will end up losing the $1,000 and still be a sad pile of used up waste.
