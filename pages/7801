'''Steampunk''' is the [[hipster|hip new thing]] in internet fashion. While the concept once [[lie|had some promise]], whatever [[potential]] it once had was irreparably destroyed by the [[obese|land whales]] and emaciated, goblin-like [[otherkin]] who have claimed it as their own. Following the 
path of [[scene]], [[emo]], and many other stupid trends, steampunk has evolved from a mere fashion statement into a [[homosexual|lifestyle]]. Steampunk enthusiasts are renowned for their ground-breaking amounts of [[unwarranted self-importance]], and every single one of them seems to be under the impression that [[no|wearing a choker or top hat magically transforms you into an aristocrat]]. A steampunk 'gentleman' will autofellate for hours online about how old-fashioned and elegant he is while picking Cheeto crumbs out of the folds of his man-tits and playing [[Gaia]].
==Join the Steampunk Revolution!==

#Buy some [[old people|dead geezer's]] paisley vest from the local thrift store   
#Steal your father's heirloom watch and take it apart
#Glue the watch parts to the vest
#Grow a porn mustache and put on a hat
#Never, ever [[basement-dweller|go outside]] 
#[[USI|ACT LIKE YOU OWN THE WORLD]]

==Steampunk Fashion==
[[hopeless|Hardcore]] [[welfare whale|steampunk enthusiasts]] will spend every penny of their gov'ment-issued income to obtain the [[shit|best]] steampunk clothing and accessories. Hell, they'd waste their food stamps too if gears were considered edible! It's no surprise that a large number of websites dedicated to selling this [[insane|ravenous]] fandom overpriced shit have popped up. [[All|Most]] fans would buy a steaming turd if it had cogs pasted onto it, and the [[forums|steampunk community]] would probably rave over the [[no|'authenticity']] and [[lame|'charm']] of the feces. Yet, while the majority of steampunk merchandise is [[plastic crap]], there are some accessories that are so over-the-top that they make [[Lexi Bee]]'s pink shit look normal. Steampunk fans are known for their lack of moderation, and they will slap metal, [[epilepsy|blinking buttons]], and useless machinery onto an item to the point where the original item's identity is completely obscured. Fans have made [[trying too hard|steampunk guitars, steampunk computers, steampunk flasks, and everything in between]]. [[Some argue|Experts theorize]] that steampunk condoms will soon be made available in 'paisley', 'zepplin', and 'goggle' designs. Unfortunately, sales would be low because all steampunk fans are [[virgins]].

==Trolling Steampunk Fans==
[[Image:Steampunkparisol.jpg|left|thumb|$80 for something that basically tells people to avoid you. At least it's made out of the luxurious material known as [[crap|paper]].]]
While a steampunk lifestyler may have a 'sense of humor', it is a sense of humor in a [[molestation|creepy uncle]] sense rather than a lulzy one. This being said, the steampunk community has mostly been untouched by [[herpes|the hands of trolls]], and many [[gay|diehard]] fans tend to take their fashion obsession [[serious business|very, very seriously]]. Because of this, the [[men]] and [[men|women]] of the subculture are particularly easy to troll. Here are some potential [[troll bait|'conversation starters']] for your next encounter with somebody who thinks that [http://brassgoggles.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,26132.0.html mechanical sex toys] are totally [[cool]].
*Point out that corsets do not transform blobs of fat into an hourglass shape.
*Mention that [[Disney]]'s [[failure|Atlantis: The Lost Empire]] was a shitty movie and that [[dinosaur|Dinotopia]] sucked too.
*Call him/her [[gothic]].
*Remind him that wearing a metallic vest and monocle in public makes him look like a [[rapist|creep]], not a gentleman.
*Compare the subculture to the furry fandom, since both groups have turned their [[fetishes]] into lifestyles.
*Say that typing with [[trying too hard|verbosity]] does not look cool- it looks douchey and contrived.
*Call steampunk a [[16-year-old girl|phase]]
*Say "Oh yeah, like [[Will Smith|Wild Wild West]]!"
*Remind them that the slave trade was booming during the Victorian era, and that the upper class made most of their profits off of it. Therefore, Steampunk enthusiasts promote slavery.
*Say that cyberpunk is vastly cooler and superior, and has much better works in its genre. Say that cyberpunk makes more sense than randomly throwing gears and steam into modern technology.

==OSHA and Steampunk==
[[File:Victorianporn.jpg|thumb|right|In the Victorian Era, these people would have been permanently imprisoned in a [[crazy|mental hospital]] because of their [[Chris-chan/SexScandal3|uncontrollable sexual frenzy]].]]
Steampunk is supposed to be based on the [[moralfag|Victorian Era]], the most fun-deprived era since the dawn of man, and the Industrial Revolution, the fastest ballooning of pollution and workplace death ever.  The idea of universal goggle-wearing is ridiculously ill-founded because workplace safety wasn't invented until the after the Haymarket Affair in Chicago in 1866 and Upton Sinclair's book ''The Jungle'' united against robber barons the world over to reduce the efficiency of pork production.  Nobody wore goggles at all.  Ever.  Not even divers.  Divers were all [[User:Thayo|flips]] who worked without any equipment whatsoever.  During the Industrial Revolution, all children between the ages of 7 and 14 ([[United States]]) or 4 and 17 ([[UK]]) were mandated to work in factories.  They worked in canneries to throw floor scraps back into the cans, textile mills to crawl between the gears of the machines and find loose threads, steel mills to work the billows of the blast furnaces, coal mines to carry dead canaries out, and brothels to assist their [[prostitute|mothers]].  They suffered from this.  Kids would often develop black lung by the age of 12 - kind of like puberty, only without a happy ending.  If they didn't die from that, they died earlier from getting sliced up in some kind of industrial accident.

Forgotten is the fact that the whole point of the Victorian Era was that no person ever had any sex with any other person.  There was no showing of flesh, ever.  Women were required by law to wear at least 4 layers of clothing between their neck and ankles and down to their wrists at all times.  Swimming could not be performed in front of the opposite sex.  If a woman wanted to swim, she asked her husband for permission, went to a women-only beach, changed into special waterproof clothing (still 4 layers) in a booth, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathing_machine and was carried in the same booth down into the water, where she could get wet without being seen].  It is thus demonstrated that there is no such thing as "sexy" Victorian Era clothing.  If there's no "sexy" Victorian Era clothing, there's no "sexy" steampunk clothing, and thereby no reason for [[slut|the women that like steampunk]] to even participate.  The only sex that took place in the Victorian era was child rape and that's when the first age of consent laws started.
 
===TL;DR Summary===
Blah blah blah ironic shit is ironic.

==The Future of Steampunk==
Some believe that steampunk is in the running to become the next evolutionary form of the [[Pokemon]] [[Hipster]], which means that it may very well end up a huge part of [[mainstream|'alternative']] fashion. [[USI]] levels skyrocket every time the fashion monster evolves, and  [[tumblr|computer models]] indicate that if the preexisting fumes of self-importance within the steampunk fandom combine with hipster-level smugness, the results could be [[2012|catastrophic]]. While it may be [[too lazy|too late]] to keep steampunk clothing from sitting on the racks of [[mall|Nordstrom]] and [[Target]], it is your duty to try and stop the [[cancer]] before it spreads.

==Fable 3==
After going though a pirate phase, Lion Head mad a LULZ worthy game for steam punks called Fable 3. The game took place 100 years ago where the world was split up between the royalty and the steam punk workers. They Don't show up much however because they get out populated by Vikings and red neck farmers.
