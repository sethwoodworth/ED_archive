'''Kansas City''' is the largest city in the state of [[Missouri]].  The city is notable for being as much of a shithole as [[Saint Louis]], and being boring enough that [[truth|suicide is the official city sport]].  Kansas City has served as the capital of trolls in the Midwestern United States since the Civil War.[[File:CanSitty.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado proofed for your safety.]][[File:Budddwyer3.jpg|right|thumb|Kansas City Civic Sports Champion, 1987]]

==Weather==
[[File:TORNADER.jpg|thumb|right|All day, every day.]]

Kansas City has shit weather, with blizzards in the winter, and extreme heat and humidity in the summer.  It is also a widely known [[fact]] that there is always at least one tornado on the ground in Kansas City at all times regardless of other weather conditions.

==Transportation==
Kansas City has more highway miles per capita than any other city in America.  Therefore, you will be driving if you visit.  The limpdicks in [[Saint Louis]] like to [[butthurt|bitch]] about how they don't get metro service to their Cardinals' games, but then forget that Kansas City doesn't have a train system at all.  The airport is all weird n' shit, and has three gates instead of the usual one, just to piss off the cab drivers.

==Book learnin'==
White kids in the north go to nice schools, while the black kids learn how to divide by cutting the newest shipment of crack.  The Kansas side no longer teaches evolution, except [[Hippies|Lawrence]], where one is burned at the stake for preaching Christianity.

==Sports==
Both the Kansas City Chiefs and the Royals haven't won a championship [[at least 100 years ago|recently]].

The Wizards won a championship in 2000, but [[fact|soccer is for fags.]]

One time World's Fastest Man Maurice Green is from the Kansas side though he claims to be from Texas, where he honed his running skills by evading police officers.

The Kansas City [[Basketball|NBA]] and [[Hockey|NHL]] teams are the only good sports teams in Kansas City, mostly because they don't exist.

==Government==
Kansas City has a weird system where the mayor doesn't actually run the town.  Instead, the City Manager does.  The mayor is Mark Funkhouser, who first gained notariety for portraying Lerch in the Addams Family TV shows and movies.  He is America's first invertabrate mayor, due to the fact that his wife, Gloria Squitiro, removed his spine years ago.  He got pissed at the city council for [[b&]]ing his wife from working at City Hall, so now, [[basement dweller|he works out of his house]].

==Size==
It's well known that Kansas City is way too spread out and it takes for fucking ever to get anywhere.  Kansas City is everywhere and is probably considering annexing your city next.

==Trolling in Kansas City==
[[Trolling IRL]] can be a hard task in some locales, but this is not the case in Kansas City.  Here's some trolling techniques:

* Call the Ask-A-Nurse hotline to ask if they recommend one type of meth over the other.
* Wear a [[pirate|Raiders]] jersey to a Chiefs game, or the jersey of any successful baseball team to a Royals game.
* Ask Mayor Mark Funkhouser if Raul Julia was nice in person on the set of The Addams Family.
* Ask why there aren't very many sports championships won by the professional teams there.
* Tell someone from Johnson County that you drive a nicer car/ own a nicer house/ make more money/ wear nicer clothes/ screw a more attractive woman than they do.
* Over-enunciate your words to those from Wyandotte County.
* [[James S. Harris| Try to steal an Xbox from a party]]. - Will result in severe injury.
* Ask the [[oldfag|middle aged residents]] of Platte County about all of the black people who have moved in since their childhood.
* Harrass [[Lowtax]].
* Open a strip club. - Technique valid for the entire state of Missouri.
** Serve beer at that strip club.
** Stay open after midnight.
* Be a black female immigrant with warrants out for your arrest, get pulled over, start to miscarry, then spend the entire night in a KCPD jail.
* Tell any resident that any other barbeque is better than the local product.
* Fall from the roof of Kemper Arena during a wrestling match.
* [[Casey Brezik|Conspire to stab the governor of Missouri but stab a junior college dean instead.]]
* Be a Vietnam Veteran that spits tobacco juice in Jane Fonda's face at a book signing.

===Bleeding Kansas and Toasty Lawrence===
Before and during the American Civil War, possibly the [[lulz|lulziest]] of race conflicts [[evar]], the vicinity of Kansas City was a veritable playground and testbed for trolls and their trolling techniques.  Perhaps most memorable of these is the war between the pro-slavery forces of Missouri and the settlers of the Kansas-Nebraska territory.  Kansas and Nebraska were a hotly disputed territory, being wanted by both the North and South to help each side.  Missouri, which was the Mecca of trolling in the US at the time, was a base of operations for the pro-slavery forces of the South.  Disliking the fact that Kansans might choose to be a free territory, Missourians went in to Kansas and did the most [[logic|logical]] thing anyone could:  pwnage.  The most affected town was Lawrence, Kansas, known in modern times as the home of the aging hippie.  One day, William Clarke Quantrill, a [[faggot]], decided that indeed, that particular day was one made for pillaging.  Quantrill and his raiders burned down Lawrence, killed anyone who could put up resistance and anyone who thought doing meth was fuckwitted.  Quantrill's raid cemented the reputation of Kansas City as a base for trolls, and is still a sore spot for Kansans, since Missourians fucking [[pwn|raided and pillaged their town]].

===The Great Hipster Troll===
In the year 2000, the [[trolls]] of Kansas City realized that they had not done an [[IRL troll]] in what [[At least 100 years ago|seemed like decades.]]  It was agreed that this had to be dealt with, lest the city's reputation of being a troll capital fall into disrepair.  The course of action that the Kansas City trolls took spawned one of the largest - and most controversial - trolls in modern history.  

At the time, Kansas City was suffering from blight in its downtown and midtown areas.  Realizing this, the city government (infiltrated with trolls itself) saw a chance to kill two birds with one stone.  It was decided that the blight would be cured with the implantation of areas and shops that would attract the young, hip crowd.  By doing so, the trolls implemented the "shotgun" trolling technique: using a troll (in this case, yuppies) against an unknown target, but knowing that the attempt at a troll will invariably piss off at least one (or maybe more) groups.  Excited about the proposition that their downtown would be alive again, the citizens of Kansas City unknowingly embraced the planned troll.  By 2006, the young people had come, and the downtown area was inhabited once more.  However, the young people of 2000 and 2006 were very, very different.  By 2006, young people had become a swarm of [[hipsters]] - one of the most reviled groups [[OL]] and [[IRL]].  The hipsters had come, and the entire Midwest and Great Plains felt their wrath.  Soon, though, the trolls of Kansas City realized that the trolls had trolled the trolls... only the trolls that were trolled were them.

By 2008, it became impossible to go to Westport without wading through a toxic sea of empty Pabst Blue Ribbon cans, Parliament cigarette cartons, and flyers for obscure bands.  Not long after, the trolls became embattled in a bitter and still unfinished civil war.  On one side were those who saw the original troll as one of the greatest of all time, while those on the other side saw the Hipster Troll as an attempt at lulz gone horribly wrong.  The pro-troll side accused the anti-trolls of falling victim to an epic case of [[troll's remorse]], while the anti-trolls labeled the pro-trollers as hipster sympathizers - a label carrying with it as much contempt as the label of lulz killer.  To this day, the civil war of the Kansas City trolls still rages, with neither side having a clear advantage.  Troll analysts and /b/tard scholars have stated that they have great concern as to whether or not one of the most legendary groups of all trolling can survive the tear.
