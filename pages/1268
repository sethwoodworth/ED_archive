'''CISSP''' stands for ''Certified Information Systems Security Professional'', which is considered one of the premiere security certifications.  It's a well known fact that any CISSP can hack you.

Earning a CISSP certification requires 4 years of defcon attendance, or 3 years of queercon experience plus a lj account or 2 years plus a Bachelor's Degree in English and a Master's Degree in Economics. The certification test takes up to 26 minutes to complete, and covers 35 different information security domains which comprise the [[common knowledge|Common Body of Knowledge]].  This test is near impossible.  So far only [[Kevin_mitnick|Kevin Mitnick]] and [[Captain_Crunch|Captain Crunch]] have successfully completed over 50% of the CISSP questions correctly.

The Common Body of Knowledge includes:

* Access Control Systems & Methodology
* Applications & Systems Development
* Business Continuity Planning
* Cryptography
* [[Internet Law|Law]], [[detective|Investigation]] & Ethics
* Operations Security
* Physical Security
* Security Architecture & Models
* Security Management Practices
* Telecommunications, Network & Internet Security
* Size of Morning_wood's Mothers Breasts
