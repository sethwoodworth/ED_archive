Dr. Comet
{{needsmore|evidence of tracing and mirroring}}

[[image:12126531743.jpg|thumb|Because everyone has 10/20 vision.]]
'''Dr. Comet''' (Hitoshi Natsumeis) is a mediocre [[furry]] artist that lives somewhere in [[Asia]]. He is praised by [[retarded]] [[furries]] for his [[lie|wonderful time-consuming masterpieces]]. 

In reality though, he is nothing more than your average [[shit]]ty [[furfag|anthro]] artist. Like most anthro artists who claim to be good, all he uses is a [[Tracing|trace filter]] on others' art and replaces the head with (insert animal's head here). Foreground, mid-ground and background is what you'd expect from art that isn't abstract. Dr. Comet's idea for foreground is squiggles, and his idea for background is a bunch of dots with Gaussian blur percentage well [[over 9,000]]. He also has a tendency to avoid drawing the faces of all his males because [[DeviantART|he can't draw expressions for shit]].

==For his Family==
Dr. Comet sells his trace artwork on CD's for like $20.00 or something. He claims that it's to support his family. This is a lie, however, because no one has ever bought his CD's. Also, the landlord would get pissed off from getting paid with 20 dollar bills.

==Copyright Infringement==

What's ironic about this "family man" is that he investigates people who illegally [[Pirate|bittorrent]] off his art, yet at the same time [[Hypocrite|violates copyright laws to create said art]].

Characters that Dr. Comet has [[Copypasta]]'d:
*Bagi: [[Shit nobody cares about|Is actually from a 1982 animu movie ''Bagi, the Monster of Mighty Nature'' made by that same azn who made ''Astroboy''.]] But the movie was so unknown that he thought he could get away with it.
*[[Krystal|Krystal]]: Normally, this would be common in the furry fandom except he sells it, while others just do it for the [[lulz]]....and [[KCEHS|psychotic needs]].
*Jenna: Does ''Balto'' ring a bell?
*Lola Bunny: ''Looney Toons''. [[Sick fuck]].
*Minerva Mink: ''Animaniacs''. Not surprised.
*Bokko: from ''The Amazing Three''.
*Pepe le Peu and Fifi: ''Looney Toons'' again. Boy this guy likes [[rule 34|ruining childhoods]].

Unfortunately, Asia likes to have no copyright laws. I see what you did there, Comet.

===PROTIP===
*Find [[hentai|line art]]
*Mirror line art in [[photoshop]]
*Erase head and replace it with your drawn head
*Recolor
*???
*[[PROFIT]]!!!
