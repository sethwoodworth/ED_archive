Shell
''This is about a shell in computer science. If you are looking for one of the components of [http://www.recipezaar.com/33870 shells and cheese], you will not find it here, retard.''

A '''shell''' on a computer allows the end [[user]] to communicate with the kernel of the computer, and in some [[operating system]]s, the [[devil]]. There are two known types of shells, [[GUI|graphical]] (i.e. [[Windows]]) and command-line (i.e. [[UNIX]]). The difference between the two is that graphical shells tend to fuck up alot and [[BSOD]] quite a bit, while command-line style allows you to totally fuck up your system beyond repair. [[Image:Command line shit.jpg|thumb|right|This is what a command line looks like. This shit is so complex [[Bill Gates]] decided to dump it for a graphical-based interface. The one you are using right now, unless you aren't on a PC.]]

Here is a list of different shells:

UNIX Shells:
* sh
* bsh
* csh
* ksh
* [[BASH|bash]]
* zsh
* sfdl;jaajs;ldfal;ekb

Windows Shells:
* PowerShell
* Explorer (they call the GUI a "shell" in windoze-speak for some reason.)


==History==
[[At least 100 years ago]], some nerd decided to build a computer. Unfortunately, he never got laid or had any friends, and so he had to figure out a way to talk to the computer. The nerd, sometimes referred to as "[[Linus Torvalds]]," created the first shell, called "gaysh" and he used it to develop the most powerful person ever: [[Optimus Prime]]. With Optimus created, Linus proceeded to take over the planet. No one knows what happened next, but we know that they won. They enslaved sexually straight individuals and forced them to perform [[sex]] all day long. This was cool for awhile, and then God got pissed and killed Linus, and all that was left was Optimus Prime, who left for Mars because he's a big baby [[faggot]] bitch. To this day, [[homosexuals]] still worship Linus, and hope that he may come back to save them.

Meanwhile, the [[GNU]] Force had their hands full with the first [[computer]]. They made [[UNIX]], and from UNIX came [[Bill Gates]], who rejected his father csh. csh called young Bill "Explorer" for this. Bill was pissed that his father still called him and so Bill killed csh with his new found abilities. He was at level 3.1 then. Today Bill "Explorer" Gates is at level 7, apparently a [[over 9000|level so powerful]] it will never be perfect.
