"'''Feels good man'''" is a [[meme]] which has plagued the [[chan]] imageboards with its [[furfaggotry]]. Basically, it involves a [[comic]] strip containing an [[anthropomorphic]] [[frog]] and [[dog]], and some other creature (according to [http://tsmo.pp.fi/kuvat/furiecomics/7spiders.jpg this] comic, the creature's name is "landwolf" which makes him a fucking wolf. How, not sure. Here's the artist's [http://tsmo.pp.fi/kuvat/furiecomics/19wolf.jpg shitty explanation]).

A little known fact is that this "meme" was popularized by Gaia Online at Halloween 2009 when one of their shitty manga comics featured it. You could call this a forced meme, considering it's [[Gaia Online]]. Anyway, continuing with the actual strip...

The frog, named '[[Mexican|Pepe]]', goes in to the bathroom, pulls down his shorts the full way takes a [[piss]] into the toilet bowl. However since he was [[retarded]] enough to leave the door unlocked, the dog is shocked to see some naked frog-[[ass]]. Later that day, another furry creature asks Pepe the frog whether he pisses with his shorts the full way down, to which he replies "feels good man".

Several [[lie|interesting]] observations may be made regarding this particular comic. [[TL;DR|By noting the position of the door relative to the frog in panels 1-3 and the frog's position in panel 5, one may conclude that this asshole frog is now pissing on the wall. Also of note, this door is of a volatile nature, as the doorknob switches sides at some point between panels 3 and 4. Or, in an even stranger turn of events, this bathroom has ''two doors''.]]

Whilst this in itself is [[lulz]], "feels good man" has moar potential, and can be thought of as a similar expression of pleasure as exclaiming "[[shit was so cash]]".

==Boys Club==
The comic strip itself, which the 'feels good man' meme originated from, is named "'''[[mantrain|Boys Club]]'''" by [[furry|Matt Furie]] (More like Matt Furry, amirite?). His comics are now particularly popular on teh chans for this reason, especially [[420chan]].
