Tripcode

A '''tripcode''' is the gobbledegook you see after [[fag]]s' names on [[4chan]]. If said 'gook matches the gook in the user's previous [[post]]s, it's the [[samefag|same person]]. (Or a [[hacker]] who cracked their tripcode)

{{quote|...because if you post annonymously [sic] by default but choose to gain a sense of identity in your posting, it most likely means that you are an attention grubbing whore who has their heart on being a board celebrity rather than actually contributing anything worthwhile.|-[[God|Anonymous]]}}


==Usage==
It works like this: In the name field, type a name, followed by #, followed by a password (or phrase, whatever). Then send a message as usual. You'll then see your name, followed by said 'gook.  You should then promptly close your browser and [[an hero]] the [[internets]] for wanting recognition on an [[anonymous]] message board.

==Example==
#In the name field, enter <code>tripman#tripcode</code>
#Send a message as usual.
#Your name in the post will appear as something like <code>tripman!3GqYIJ3Obs</code> OH FUCK THAT'S MY TRIPCODE

==Purpose==
Having an identity all his own allows the tripfag live out his dream of becoming an [[internet celebrity]].  While this may be good for his fragile ego, it is generally considered a faux pas on traditionally [[anonymous]] image boards such as those found on [[4chan]].  If you notice someone using a tripcode on such an image board, you are encouraged to give that person the following [[goatse|friendly advice]]:

{{squote|Hi there!

You seem to have made a bit of a mistake in your post. Luckily, the users of 4chan are always willing to help you clear this problem right up! You appear to have used a tripcode when posting, but your identity has nothing at all to do with the conversation! Whoops! You should always remember to stop using your tripcode when the thread it was used for is gone, unless another one is started! Posting with a tripcode when it isn't necessary is poor form. You should always try to post anonymously, unless your identity is absolutely vital to the post that you're making!

Now, there's no need to thank me - I'm just doing my bit to help you get used to the anonymous image-board culture!|Someone more intelligent than [[you]]}}

[[TL;DR]] Tell them to go away and while they're going places to go fuck themselves.
