Power Rangers
{{crap}}

[[Image:Motivator power rangers by sadeku.jpg|thumb|Motivate yourself.]]
'''Power Rangers''' was originally a TV show from [[Japan]] about people in [[BDSM | spandex suits]] and helmets running around and fighting [[Quasidan's penis|giant monsters]] with [[robot]]s. The 1992 Japanese installment was picked up by some Jew [[Rupert Murdoch|U.S. TV execs]] in 1993 and made into a cash cow, to milk the money out of boys in elementary school. While many of us have fond memories of it from growing up, Saban, in a show of [[original content|originality]], decided to follow in the footsteps of its stupid Japanese counterpart and change storylines, cast members, and locations every five minutes, often forgetting about and never mentioning the preceding (and better) one ever again. This promptly ruined Power Rangers for anybody who once enjoyed it and there are now [[over 9,000]] different ''Power Rangers'' series, <strike>with more on the way</strike> <strike>NOT ANYMORE!!!!</strike> ([[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]]) with more on the way.

'''The show was also ripped off by a local TV Station in the Philippines and was titled ''[[Zaido]]''.'''

===The Original Power Rangers===

[[Image:Patricia_ja_lee_haruhi.JPG|thumb|Pink Rangers are in your [[Haruhi]], spreading spandex everywhere.]]

Black Ranger '''Zack''': Portrayed by black guy. Is good at hip-hop dancing, incorporates it into fighting. Wow. Also his is the only weapon that turns into a gun.

Yellow Ranger '''Trini''': Portrayed by an Asian woman (coincidence?). Died in a car accident in 2001, RIP Yellow Ranger.  She was cremated and fed to Zordon.

Red Ranger '''Jason''': Was a karate master and outdoor sports fan [[IRL]] at time of filming. He somehow became a fatass after quitting.

Blue Ranger '''Billy Bob''': Only one with half a brain. 

Pink Ranger '''Kimberly''': Every elementary school boy wants to fuck her.  Is in some shitty cop show titled '''Flashpoint''' nao.

Green Ranger '''Tommy''': Evil dude at first, becomes good cause he raped the Pink One

White Ranger "Same guy as above": a faggot that all the weaboo fangirls love, was the Green guy at first. Rapes the red guy and steals his leadership position.

===Replacements===

New Red Ranger '''Mexican Rocky Balboa''': Rocky Balboa's [[Mexican]] bastard son, nothing much else to say about him.

New Black Ranger '''Johnny Yong Bosch''': Known by [[weeaboos]] around the world as the voice of Vash and [[Bleach|Ichigo]] from a [[shitty]] [[animu]]s. He is a [[Korean]] but plays ''[[Warcraft]]'' instead of ''[[Starcraft]]''. 

New Yellow Ranger '''Nigger Lady''': She hails from Africa and returns to Africa when she realizes some Egyptian niggers killed all her lions and turned them into fur coats. 

New Pink Ranger '''Kat''': An Australian [[Furry]] bitch, seriously, Rita Repulsa turned her into a giant Furry to turn the other Rangers into Furries. Kimberly saw this plan a mile away and promptly broke up with Tommy and went to [[France]] to suck French cock. Tommy, now single and no one to suck his cock, gave Kat the Pink Power Morpher Coin so she can un-furry herself and be the Australian whore that she was destined to be.

===Alien Rangers===

Aliens, what the fuck do you think they are? One of them is a [[Gay Niggers from Outer Space|space nigger]]. The girl likes to suck Tommy's cock, though.

===Zeo Rangers===

Everyone from the replacement teams but they get their colors switched, Tommy is Red, Rocky Balboa is Blue, and Johnny is Green.  They get an <s>African slave</s> Nigger as their new Yellow Ranger, she has a giant nose and mouth like most slaves. Jason also comes back as the Gold Ranger after he has gay sex with Triplets from some Planet that has Pyramid robots. 

===CarRangers===

After the Triplets take the Gold Ranger powers back so that they can fuse into one, Jason becomes evil and makes Kimberly evil and wants revenge on the Rangers. Zordon was like "Ah hell no" while watching Pimp my Ride and decided to give the rangers Car powers.  Also Rocky Balboa broke his leg after watching the new Rocky movie so some kid with AP powers took his place. Then Zordon was like "[[Renetto|I NEED MOAR BLACK PEOPLE ON JEWTUBE]]" and fired all the Rangers and got a new team. Billy Bob wanted to goto Alien Rangers' homeworld to have sex with Cestria so they can have alien children.

Red Ranger '''T.J.''': The black person Red Ranger Zordon always wanted

Green Ranger '''Carlos''': A stereotypical [[Mexican]] with a thick accent, The Rangers can't understand him half the time so they have him wash their cars and do their laundry most of the time. 

Blue Ranger '''Justin''': A Faggot [[Shota|10 year old]] that AP's when he morphs, he is only there to have sex with everyone on the show

Yellow Ranger '''Ashley''': Your standard high school tomboy cheerleader type girl that tries to remain a [[technical virgin]].

Pink Ranger '''Cassie''': Some Asian girl but raised like a white girl, has Ranger sex with Phantom Ranger and just by saying Phantom Ranger makes her [[cum]]. Resurfaced evidence from 2006 shows that she is in fact '''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya|Haruhi Suzumiya]]''' irl, and the [[weaboo]]s went crazy. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHx1QhgOaLo]

'''Phantom Ranger''': Some robot faggot that always gets his ass kicked but heals by having sex with Cassie. Gets thrown into space by mutant clams.

===Space Rangers===

Zordon gets kidnapped and sent into space, so four of the Rangers follow him in space and meet Legolas's half brother Andros and become Space Rangers. T.J. becomes Blue and Carlos Black. 

Red Space Ranger '''Andros''': Legolas's half brother, tries to act cool but really knows nothing about having a life, seriously.  He has psychic powers which he learned from [[Slowpoke]] himself. He asked Ashely to teach him pool after Math class but [[it's a trap]]! Andros just raped her on the pool table in the Halodeck which he borrowed from [[Patrick Stewart]].   

Silver Ranger '''Zhane''': Some guy that was better than Andros, Andros secretly hated him stealing the spotlight from him during Andros's [[emo]] days so Andros froze Zhane for [[over 9,000]] years while Zhane was on his way to a ''Titanic'' audition. Then T.J. unfroze him like a dumb black person.

The only real highlight of this version is the [[crossover]] with ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', not the classic cartoon we all grew up with, but the shitty live-action FOX version with the girl turtle), and Zordon instructing Andros to make him [[an hero]].

===Galaxy Rangers===

No Guts, No Glory. It has been said that the best thing about this is the dominatrix Karone who flaunted her sexy body in leather so tight that she had to hold her mouth open to breathe. Because of this, when she wasn't sucking cock, she drooled all over herself. Nobody cared because she was fucking hot.

==Why all the Lineup Changes?==
Since its beginning, ''Power Rangers'' has been fraught with lineup changes over which actors are or aren't being paid enough. The first Rangers team consisting of Jason, Trini, and Zach reportedly left because they felt they weren't being paid enough. [[Last_Thursday|Recent evidence]], however, has uncovered startling new reasons for the original Red Ranger's departure. Since the introduction of Jason David Frank, the Green Ranger, tensions between him and Austin St. John, the actor who played the Red Ranger, have heightened. Because Mr. St. John was a born-again Evangelical Christian, news reports have confirmed him being uncomfortable around his co-star. At the time, it is also believed that Jason David Frank was a closeted [[Gay|homosexual]] who had just come to terms with his sexuality and as such, [[Surprise_buttsecks|he could not contain his feelings towards his fellow co-worker much longer]]. It is now believed that Austin St. John finally left the show because he felt "uncomfortable" in the presence of "Tommy".  

Later on, though, Austin St. John returned for ''Power Rangers: Zeo''. It is believed that around this time, he and Jason David Franke signed a "No Touching" stipulation clause with Saban ruling that "Tommy" was to keep his hands to himself. This clause lasted from St. John's duration as the Gold Ranger to the beginning of the ''Turbo'' movie. It was at the beginning of the ''Turbo'' series that Mr. Franke breached the contract once more, resulting in Austin St. John leaving the series permanently. 

...at least until "Forever Red". But by that time, Jason David Franke had lost interest. After all, the other Red Rangers were in much better physical shape for his roving eyes.

==Length==

[[Image:prspd34.jpg|thumb|''Power Rangers'' [[Rule 34]]]]

It has [[moar]] series and spin-offs than Menudo has members. It's not like anyone cared after the original pink slut ranger left anyway. Except the [[16_year_old_girl|16 year old]] [[Ship|Green/Pink Ranger shippers]], of course - seriously, [[Over_9000|over 9,000]]% of all fanfiction from this series is about Green and Pink being [[emo]] over each other for breaking up between the original series and ''Zeo''.

==List of Power Rangers series==

[[Image:Hurricanger34.jpg|thumb|[[Moar]] [[Rule 34]], by the Japanese.]]

[[Image:Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers_(E).005.jpg|thumb| The video game adaptation basically involved killing a certain number of [[fags]] dressed in purple spandex. Note the huge bulge on Kimberly.]]

*''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers''

*Season Two where they replace the Black guy with a [[Korean]], the [[AZN|Asian]] girl with a black girl, and the Red dude with a beaner. Cause the original Red was like "I want a raise", so he got fired, and the black guy was like "Ah hell no boy, if he goes I go" and he got fired too, and they fired the Asian girl cause they felt like it. 

*Season Three where they become KKK Ninjas and get a British whore.

*Alien Rangers, cause 40 Year old fanfic writers made the Rangers AR and wanted some alien pussy.

*''Power Rangers Zeo'', where they replace Animals for shapes so they can reverse what the fanfic writers did. Former Red guy comes back as Gold guy to try to take revenge on the White guy turned new Red guy for his sodomized buttcheeks. Former Red guy fails, loses his powers, and gets fondled by King Mondo.

*''Power Rangers Jungle [[Furry]]'', 2008 series. Oh shit Furry's have invaded ''Power Rangers''.

*"Power Rangers RPM", where the world is taken over by a computer [[virus]]. The rangers are composed of a blue ranger that speaks in  [[Woll smoth]], a black ranger who is a cyborg with [[emo|amnesia]] that gets more character development than all the other rangers combined, and the worst [[retard|special]] rangers ever. Oh yeah. And the Black and Green rangers are lovers.

[[Image:Mmpr2010epicfail.png‎|thumb| MMPR 2010, teaching the newfags of tomorrow.]]

*"Mighty Morphin Rerun Rangers", After Japan saw how bad Power Rangers RPM was, Disney lost the rights to Power Rangers and started showing reruns of the first season with shitty effects no one uses.

*"Power Rangers Samurai...Just Samurai", Saban has come back from the dead and is working on the season Disney didn't show you as we speak. It's gonna be on Nickelodeon and won't air until 2011. What with being held back and all.

=Agony in Pink=

[[Image:PinkPowerRanger.jpg|thumb|ZOMG!! SO HAWT!!!]]

In 1994, a person known as "The Dark Ranger" posted a fanfiction depicting the Pink Ranger being tortured on usenet. It is notable for its intense torture scenes and causing people to get pissed in Australia.

The below is chapter 5 of the alleged fanfic:<br>

<big><big><big>[[Power Rangers/Agony In Pink|Chapter 5 of the fanfic may be found here]]</big></big></big>

==Power Rangers Dianetics Force==

A 1980S commercial for the [[Scientologist]] axis movement clearly shows the original Yellow Ranger [[Asian|Trini]] saying, amongst others, the word "Trust" in her native language. Alpha, Xenu's escaped! Recruit a team of teenagers with ineptitude.

<youtube>SpQnwgiplrY</youtube>

Trini, actress Thuy Trang died in a car crash in 2001. Tom Cruise drove right past...probably realizing she was only a man in the ''Japanese'' footage. Asian women are such bad drivers.

== Rangerboard ==

Rangerboard is a [[shit]] forum for ''Power Rangers'' fans of all ages, and its fucking huge. User's ages range from 8 to 58 (Seriously), but most users are around the age of 10 or 25. The amount of posts per minute are similar to 4chan but usually they are full of [[shit no one cares about]]. Even people buy shit on Rangerboard, usually threads consist of "HEY GAIZ GIMME A POWER MORPHER FOR $10"! or "I'm a broke black person selling stuff to get into college". How one usually purchases an item from a user is "$150 Dolla for DX Dragonzord MISB!". Most Rangerboard users are kids that never even heard of [[goatse]], [[tubgirl]], or [[lemon party]], so wouldn't it be a good time to change a young Power Ranger's fans life with a little goatse?

Notably, the board is also home to a large thread dedicated entirely to [[gay]] [[gay|''Power Rangers'' fans]]. This is a prime example of a [[Chris Crocker|self-generating lulz machine]], as this very same thread causes distortions in the space time continuum that make the board's inner workings become butthurt and glitch due to its massive [[cock|size]]. Nobody can say anything, however, because they're all gay and telling them that their pointless thread is bad for the board means you're a horrible homophobe. 

Questioning them is subject to [[rape|dire consequences]].

Among the thread's most frequent [[you|contributors]] are:

*[[Twilight|Tristanism]] - Huge fan of ''[[shit|Final Fantasy VII]]'' and writer of the gay novel ''[[shit nobody cares about|Reign]]'' and ''Power Rangers'' fanfic ''[[lemon party|Starlight Rain]]''. Suggesting his thread is shit results in banhammer. 

*[[Brian Peppers|BB Mack]] - Thread's resident bitch. Used for sperm deposit. 

*kakuwhite18 - A [[retard|pagan nun]].

*Acatl - Called "Maiki" by [[fag|friends]] who love his doll collection and give him [[unwarranted self importance|praise]]. Watches ''[[High School Musical]]''.

*[[Internet Tough Guy|Decade]] - Current forum owner and complete fucking bitch who will give you a shit attitude and ban you for doing the slightest thing wrong. Please troll frequently.

*JDF'd - [[Hypocrite|Awesome guy.]]

== Ranger Talk ==

[[Image:Rttubgirl.PNG|thumb|How to troll Ranger Talk.]]

Similar to Rangerboard but a lot smaller, more shitty and run by [[retards|highly competent administrators]]. They take even the slightest comments as death threats and they are always fun to troll. They can be found at http://rangertalk.com
