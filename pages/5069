'''MONGO''', born [[Osama bin Laden|Ahmed Ali Mansoor]], is a [[old people|ranting old coot]] and self-confessed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tony_Sidaway/Archive_2006_05_20#I.27m_just_an_inbred_.27merican inbred] from [[White trash|Crackerville, Montana]]. He spends 18 hours a day editing [[Wikipedia]], while "on the c(l)ock" as a United States Government agent, defending Bush administration policy. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/MONGO#MONGO],[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/MONGO#Regarding_Tom_Harrison.27s_comment], [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Image:MongoUSDHS.jpg] The rest of his day is spent trying to [[rape|convince]] [[retard]]ed children that his penis is a strawberry [[semen|ice cream cone]]. MONGO was an infamous [[wiki]] [[admin]]istrator, but even Wikipedia denied him after it was discovered that the Canadian Federal Government investigated MONGO in August 2006 for violations of child pornography laws, hiring illegal immigrants for the sex trade, and for being a fucking lying douchebag.

==MONGO did WTC==   

[[Image:Mongo_pwnd37228.JPG|thumb|[[Gaia]] fucking up MONGO's talk page. MONGO's existence has finally been validated. He can now [[Suicide|die happily]].]]

MONGO works for [[W]] in the [[Bantown|Department of Homeland Security]]. He trolls Wikipedia to hide government conspiracies in the name of national homo security.  He is also a [[Conservatism|conservative]] tool, in it for the lulz and cheap women.

{{quote|Mongo, in all honesty, when state that you work for USDHS and then immediately archive the ensuing discussion that lasted for about 3 days, I'm sure a lot of people are going to assume it's because you don't want people to see it.|SkeenaR|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MONGO/Archive08]}}
    
{{quote|Given that you are employed by the U.S. Gov't, and actively engaged in combating conspiracy theorists in various WTC-related articles, the suspicion that Uncle Sam might be rewarding you for this in some form or fashion is, in my opinion, a rather natural suspicion...|Freakofnurture|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MONGO/Archive10]}}

==MONGO's Activities on Wikipedia==

[[Image:MongoUSDHS.jpg|thumb|300px|MONGO reveals that he is actually an employee of the Homeland Security Department, working on Wikipedia.]]

[[Image:Mongogofuckyourself.jpg|thumb|300px|How about you go fuck yourself?]]

MONGO mainly creates and edits articles related to nature reserves in the [[US]]. He, in the [[Git-r-done|true hillbilly tradition]], frequently visits the great outdoors to make love to deceased mountain goats. MONGO also concentrates on making sure any [[9/11]] [[JEWS DID WTC|conspiracy theories]] do not make it to Wikipedia. Needless to say, this has a lot to do with MONGO's obsession and infatuation with [[George W. Bush]] and the [[Republican]] Government. MONGO is undergoing counseling for the same, according to a court order in an indecent exposure case when Montana State Troopers arrested MONGO after they discovered him sitting on a park-bench, holding his penis in one hand and a poster of [[George W. Bush]] in the other.

MONGO also publicly states open hatred of [[homosexual]]s, perhaps a result of the traumatic experiences suffered by him as a child at the hands of one [[Vinny the Rapist]]. However he keeps one of the largest collections of dildos in the US, which he hardly ever washes after use.

MONGO pretends he is an Islamophobe [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&diff=prev&oldid=9457366], but it is common knowledge that he only does this to conceal from his colleagues at the [[9/11|Department of Homeland Security]] the fact that he is a Muslim by birth. In fact he was romantically involved with a drag-queen named [[gay|Booty-bin-Shoful]] from Baghdad. What is even more suspicious is MONGO's infatuation with another she-male [[Ann Coulter]], who we all know is an Al-Qaeda operative in disguise.

MONGO's may never have another shot at adminship  ever since [http://pornotube.com/media.php?m=338454 this compromising video of him in a fur suit] emerged. Although several users lobbied for MONGO to be banned on moral grounds, [[Jimbo]] defended him by stating there is no policy against [[incest]], or [[Furry|furries]], for that matter (but we repeat ourselves). Therefore, this [[fat]], deeply repressed, self loathing, ex-Muslim, [[republican|homo-fascist]], [[blowjob|cocksucker]] is a celebrated member of Wikipedia

If you have ever had the misfortune of running across this first-rate [[bureaucratic fuck]], feel free to contact him [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MONGO here] and tell him to verify whether this article is in accordance with [[shit nobody cares about|WP:NPOV]] and [[shit nobody cares about|WP:NPA]] and [[shit nobody cares about|WP:OFFICE]] and [[shit nobody cares about|WP:NO]] and [[shit nobody cares about|WP:CIVIL]] and [[shit nobody cares about|WP:NOR]] and [[WP:DNLAED]]. Or else just go ahead and [[I did it for the lulz|do it for the lulz]].

Someday, [[children]] diddled by this nutjob will rejoice as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Former_administrators#14 karma swings around].

{{quote|Quite frankly...who gives a crap what you think? The event happened in the U.S. and your anti-American bias is [[wat|so obvious you can cut it with a knive]] so shove off. I don't go into articles about events that happened in countries outside the U.S. and tell them they're biased. You're failure to see that the events of 9/11 were textbook level definitions of terrorism betray your obvious anti-American bias. Stop wasting our time with this radical nonsense.--MONGO 15:56, 8 August 2006 (UTC)|}}

==MONGO's Reaction to This [[Article]]==

[[Image:Mongo at the Ranch april 2005.jpg|thumb|MONGO finally gets brave enough to upload a new picture.]]

[[Image:Edvsmongo.gif|thumb|ED pwning MONGO.]]

[[Image:Mongotalk.gif|thumb|MONGO's existence has finally been validated. He can now [[Suicide|die 
happily]].]]

Ever since MONGO discovered this article, he has displayed a level of [[insane|batshit insanity]] far surpassing [[Mistress Selina Kyle]] of [[The Wikipedia Review]], [[Dick Cheney]] shooting someone in the face, and [[Tom Cruise]] put together. He has deleted an old revision from his userpage simply because this article linked to it. He went so far to protect Wikipedia's  article about ED (in violation of [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines|Wikipedia policies]]). He then edited it with [[White people|sysop privileges]] (a further violation). Finally, with the assistance of a few dozen [[sockpuppet]]s, MONGO placed it on the [[VFD|votes for deletion]] section of the site, and the rest is history.

After complaining about personal attacks, he came here and made them himself. CheckUser finds [[User:MONGO1]] is 24.252.28.188 (ip24-252-28-188.om.om.cox.net) from Nebraska. He used [[User:Ed Poor]] to impersonate that Wikipedia ex-bureaucrat with AOL IPs. '''OMG MONGO PROVES IT IS HIM ON WIKIPEDIA!''' [[Tony Sidaway]], another Wikipedia admin and sexual deviant, colluded in this with him.

{{quote|You know what, I think I will now delete the history of those IP's just so you stay curious. I suppose I need to get an account at ED and tell them it is me so they can then do a checkuser and then you'll see that it is the one and only time I logged into there. ''But'', the problem is, I don't want those guys posting my true IP on the article that is over there about me. Don't you think I would have either gone into that website myself or had one of my "friends" take care of it if it was my IP...think.|MONGO|[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKarwynn&diff=65069072&oldid=65068002]}}

==MONGO's Activities on ED==
Once Mongo learned of the article, he came to ED and vandalized the fuck out of articles, especially this one - usually [[blanking]] pages.  He's used a ton of sock puppets. Now even the most abominable [[fucktard]] in the world would realize that this article was created solely to piss this stupid fuck off and to show the world the truth about him. That notwithstanding, MONGO has repeatedly raised objections against this brilliant piece of work, saying it violates [[shit nobody cares about|WP:NPOV, WP:NPA, WP:ARTICLES MAY NOT CONTAIN PICTURES OF MONGO FUCKING FOLIAGE, etc, etc,]]. So, on behalf of Encyclopedia Dramatica, if you have any issues MONGO please take it up here [[goatse|on our help-desk]].

[[Image:Bitches-MONGO.jpg|thumb|They mustn't know.]]

==About MONGO==

[[Image:Mongoloid idiocy.jpg|right|thumb|MONGO was diagnosed with a disease not so rare but he was such a prime example they named it after him, Mongolism.  Even Wikipedia has a page for it [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolism]]

He has been called MONGO for almost 30 years as a nickname...he had to capitalize all my letters because someone else was already listed with lower case letters by the same name. He was nicknamed by my friends after the character Mongo played by football star Alex Karras in the movie ''Blazing Saddles''. Apparently being a 6'7" and 280-pound giant also had a big part in the choice of nickname. He kind of likes it, but oftentimes wishes he was about a half a foot shorter and a hundred pounds lighter. Consequently, he doesn't drive an economy car as he simply can't fit into one.

MONGO is also a [[Wikipedia:backronym|backronym]] for [[Masturbating|'''M'''asturbating]] '''O'''ver [[GNAA|'''N'''igger '''G'''ays]] [[Online|'''O'''nline]], suggesting how he spends most of his time.

He was born and raised in Montana, and has lived in eleven different states over the past 25 years. He [[basement dweller|has traveled all across the U.S.]] but has yet to visit Europe, Asia or Australia.

He has a BA in Physical Anthropology and have a MS in Forensics. He has worked as a National Park Ranger at four different National Parks over a dozen years at such beautiful places as Grand Teton, Yellowstone, Glacier, and Shenandoah. He celebrated his 57th birthday in September 2006, which is also in keeping with how he looks in the photograph and also the fact that he spent the "last 25 years" traveling around the U.S. His political views also imply that that he is probably involved with the Republicans in his area." - Quite clearly MONGO or one of the said followers.

MONGO claims to be affiliated with the [[Department of Homeland Security]], but in reality, he is unemployed and lives with his parents. He was fired from the DOH for looking at pornography on the job.

===Philosophy on knowledge===

In a moment of extreme humility, MONGO recently [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AEncyclopedia_Dramatica&diff=215097570&oldid=215093815 acknowledged], "Hum...too much knowledge is not really good in some areas", proving that he's proud to be an ignoramus, and proving that he prefaces profound statements with "Hum...".

===Wikipedia definition of MONGO===

[[Image:Mongo's Wife.jpg|left|thumb|Mongo and his fiancÃ©, Debbie (Deadeye Deb), (also infected with mongolism), notice Mongo is a sexually deviant [[furry]].]]

A variant of "mong", a pejorative term for someone with mental retardation.<s>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongo]</s> [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mongo wiktionary says mongo is an idiot.]

==MONGO [[I did it for the lulz|did something for the lulz]]!!!!==
'''Q:''' What exactly do you do for homeland security?

'''MONGO:''' What is homeland security? [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2006%2FCandidate_statements%2FQuestions_for_MONGO&diff=87302046&oldid=87215342 (proof)]

==Trolling Wins==
{{quote|Trolling wins

Had enough...goodbye to this place.|MONGO|17:35, 8 December 2006 (UTC)}}

==Karma swings around==
On April 12th, MONGO was blocked for telling a petulant administrator to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MONGO&diff=205064220&oldid=204721651 get lost], he then left Wikipedia forever, The irony of MONGO quitting due to an abusive administrator was not lost on anyone.  

==MONGO spills his IP==
After years of denying his IP started with a 6 and claiming it started with a 2, MONGO suddenly [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=236866063 spills his IP] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=next&oldid=236868337 and then links to it].  It was the same IP range and reverse DNS he used to vandalize ED that he for so long denied was him.
