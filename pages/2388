The introduction to the story A Werejohncandy Tale. 

{{frame|Hello there everyone.  Welcome to the clubhouse.   Come inside and take a look around.



My name is Charles Huggington Jr, but you may refer to me as Chumsley.  I am a Canadian Forest Werejohncandy.




Don't be scared of me, I don't bite. In fact I'm very gentle and soft. I'm quite jolly and friendly.

I love to eat, roar, hug and play with all my friends. Because i'm a very happy werejohncandy. I like to go on all sorts of adventures. And when I go on a new adventure I like to send postcards to my friends. I also like to tell stories when I get back from my adventures. I'm quite good at singing and storytelling and I am a damm good cook. I have a lot of relatives, about 27 or more to be precist. I love hugs and cuddles and tummy rubs - I especially love it when my owner Nathan "Dr Music" Forester rubs my big, warm, round, furry tummy - it makes me roar with happiness. Feel free to visit me anytime you like. }}
