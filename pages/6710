A '''pyro''' (short for ''pyromaniac'')  is a common type of outcast [[teenager]] that has about as much [[angst]] as a [[goth]] kid, but instead of writing stupid [[poetry]] or [[cutting]] themselves, they take their pain out by blowing shit up, as in a pyro's motto: "ROFL SAWCIETEE SUX0RZ SO LETS BLO SHIT UP".

Typical pyros are mostly basement dwelling losers who want to get back at their classmates or the [[police]] for actually having a life. Pyros will gain most of their knowledge by reading 20 year old [[text files]] and by surfing around [[Geocities]] pages with plenty of flame [[gif]]s and spinning skulls.  Their Bible is the famous [[Text_files#Internet_Anarchy|Anarchists Cookbook]] which has plenty of awesome "recipes" for "social change" (i.e. a shitty excuse for [[random]] [[vandalism]]). They believe that this knowledge gives them some [[e-penis|sort of power]], in spite of the fact that 90% of text files will do nothing or just kill you.  

Politically just like anarchists, pyros are violent anti-authority freaks who believe that [[W]] is the source of all of their problems. These problems range from how they [[Virgin|can't get laid]] to why did the hardware store clerk reported them for buying five boxes of stump remover.

When talking on the internets about making explosives, they will try to trick the [[police]] by saying they "dreamed" about making a bomb.  You are not fooling anyone.  If a pyro lives up to the age of 19, he will defiantly turn into a [[survivalist]].
