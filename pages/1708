Complete rewrite
{{Finalsolutions}}
Also known as '''Burning Down The House''', '''Format C:''', or '''Aunt Flo Is Visiting'''.

* On [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], a good place to look for articles needing a complete rewrite is the [[:Category:Crap|Crap category]] - articles in need of a rewrite are so marked with the <nowiki>{{crap}}</nowiki> template.
* On [[Apple|Apple products]], a "complete rewrite" entails downloading the latest crapfest from [http://Kernel.org kernel.org], adding a [[fat]] and ugly [[Mac OS X|interface]] and then claiming to [[Reality Distortion Field|have invented unix]].
* On [[Livejournal]] a complete rewrite is more or less the equivalent of removing an entry (or select contents thereof) in order to not offend and lose the money of corporate sponsors.
* A normally-good band will "re-invent" themselves into a [[shit]]ty band in order to drive up sales, usually by adopting a "punk rawk" persona.

With the noted exception of the first point, generally a complete rewrite is a bad thing, due to the second law of thermodynamics which states that all systems are spiraling down in to disorder, also known as the law of [[User:Entropy|entropy]].
