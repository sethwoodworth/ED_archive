[[Image:FFFffffat.jpg|thumb|left|]][[Image:Fat chick with gun.jpg|thumb|right|There's nothing hotter than a fat chick with a gun.]]Known as "MushiCrosshairs" on FA, this furfag plays a [[16-year old girls|15-year old]] cunt who knows more about guns than the army. In real life, she's a 19-year old furry fuck who lives in Colorado and draws furry porn of her kid self being dragged by the clit. She also enjoys the occasional threesome with her murry purry mate and roommate. Oh! and did we forget the humping of a good old fashioned [[sick fuck|plushie]]?

She's very good at taking critique and helpful criticism and is '''always''' willing to give her own.

=Guns: She Knows Them=
[[Image:Gun lesson.jpg|thumb|left|"This is how you do it guys!"]][[Image:Hypothetically Speaking.png|thumb|right|Hypothetically Speaking.....]]
If you ever post artwork or anything about your fictional character, you best not ever say they are a pro at '''anything''' because Mushi will demand proof, '''especially''' if it's about guns. [[unwarranted self-importance|Because clearly she is the only one who knows]] moar and has fired moar guns than most people know exist. For example...

One fine day on FurAffinity, a commissioner posted up their artwork which depicted [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2339492/ a character holding some kind of old-fashioned gun] to [[an hero|their head]]. The artist was clearly proud about this piece, and so was the artist who was to receive it. However, Mushi Cunthairs would have [[do not want|none of that]]. [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2339492/#cid:17108596 Like a bat], she quickly swooped down and proceeded to [[flame]] the artist about [[shit nobody cares about|HOW NO ONE SHOULD FUCKING HOLD A GUN LIKE THAT YOU FUCKING RETARDS!]]. While the artist was open to her "constructive" criticism, Mushi [[retard|couldn't understand]] this little thing called "artistic licenses" and fucking blew two thousand gaskets. [[rage|GODDAMN IT WHY CAN'T YOU FUCKERS DRAW YOUR GUNS CORRECTLY!!!!1]]

Thus came [[over 9000]] whiny [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2339492/#cid:17108596 journals] and bawwwwfests about how stupid everyone was being because of their ~* gun stupidity *~. She proceeded to make a "Hypothetical Question" journal making comparisons to "Mahler's Symphony No. 1 D-Major" and sheet music that reads as the notes for "Yankee Doodle." Right because someone would go through that much effort.[[hypocrite|Don't you love how her journal says "INTERNET, SERIOUS BUSINESS" but yet she whines and fucking complains about ''dipshits holding a trigger wrong''?!]]

In fact, the dickweed takes her precious gunz so srsly that she was also [[butthurt|kind enough]] to make a [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2340306  tutorial].

[[Image:It's ok she's 15.png|thumb|left|Because 15-year olds don't have fully formed index fingers.]]

Little did she know in order to '''index''' a gun, [[lol wut|one needs an index finger]]. But really it's ok guyz, because she's a '''15 year old kid''' and automatically it means she's in the right with stubby missing knuckles digits. But the real reason is because she was using her artistic foreshortening skills. [[lie|OH I see.]] When people once again called her out on her hypocrisy, she then ran off to [[DevianTART]] telling everyone to "please flame her picture there". However, being the [[pussy]] [[cunt]]rag cumdumpster that she is, she [[delete fucking everything|disabled all comments]] from her website. WAY TO GO, FAGGOT! YOU REALLY SHUT THEM DOWN!

=Her Murry Purry Mates=
Cain, or "Shenwolf" as he goes by on FA is her murry purry mate and he's just as [[fat]] and hairy as she portrays him. They tend to share their love all over the interbutts spreading TOO much TMI about each other. In fact he's SO PROUD of her that's he's spent money to actually frame up '''ALL''' her artwork and have them portrayed like a real art gallery in their hallway.She's one step closer to her goal and step up from posting art on the fridge. And if hearing all this doesn't make you gag, she enjoys a [[buttsex|rousing romp]] with her [[plushie]] lion "Rory" We can't give you hard facts on her threesomes, howevar, so far we only have "suggestive" art that leads us to believe they do go on. There's probably some [[faggotry|hanky panky]] going on if you check out her Youtube. We've linked it at the bottom.
