'''DougsTech''' is a [[Wikipedia]] [[troll]] who opposes every [[Basement dweller|administrator hopeful]] due to the [[fact]] that there are [[Do not want|"too many administrators currently"]]. Being the [[Jews]] that they are, the Wikipedos have [[banned|succeeded]] in their attempts to [[Scientology|silence this source of opposition]], generating much lulz in the process and proving that Wikipedia admins are indeed all [[homosexual]] Zionist scum.

==The trolling==
It all began one day, after having done enough bullshit edits, when he [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Mentifisto&diff=prev&oldid=278242564 opposed] one [[Wikipedo]] with his reasoning. Since then, he has opposed every single candidate with that [[logic]]. He has since justified his opinions based on the fact that [[Truth|there are too many bad admins]]. This threatened the [[Jew gold|power]] of the Wikipedo admins, so they have [[Microsoft|tried endlessly to remove him]].

Even though DougsTech's actions seem deceptively simple, one has to appreciate what an ingenious act of trolling this is. It makes the Wikipedo admins [[butthurt]], but enough people agree or are fooled by him and DougsTech is an established editor so they can't just ban him as a troll.

In a [[Assume good faith|good faith]] attempt to improve the [[Final solution|gene pool]] of the Wikipedo admins, Doug [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/ChildofMidnight|nominated a heterosexual Non-Zionist]] for adminship. However, this did not go through for some reason, as [[List_of_heterosexual_Wikipedia_admins|some things are not meant to change]].

==The Rapeage==
Because Doug is a pioneer in uncovering the Jew of the Wikipedo admins, they have tried [[Nazi|every means possible]] to silence him to keep their [[Jew gold|power]] safe, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&oldid=288666986#Proposed_topic-ban_of_Dougstech_from_.21voting_or_commenting_in_RfA such as by this failed ban attempt]. However, fortunately for him, enough people held on to their money that the [[Jews|admins]] did not succeed. Doug's success at trolling can be seen in the fact that one admin even [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DougsTech/Archives#Blocked_indefinitely_.2F_now_unblocked tried to block him] leading to calls for that admin's resignation, and he has caused one Wikipedo [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DougsTech/Archives#.22They_do_whatever_they_want.22 to lash out at him]. 

Also, don't forget the [[Sceptre]] [[faggotry]] that is obligatory for a situation like this. Sceptre took to [[vandalism|vandalizing]] his userpage in another attempt to [[harass]] him.

==The End????==
Recently, after that faggot [[Ryulong]] was desysopped, he made a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ryulong&diff=prev&oldid=292787333 trolling edit] to the aformentioned faggot's talk page as well as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DougsTech&diff=prev&oldid=292787407 his own], causing much lulz. The kindly told Doug what he could do, specifically, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ryulong&oldid=292788987 Eat shit and die]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=293039889 Doug sought justice against this faggot but he was thwarted.] What would have been an epic act of trolling for him turned instead into an excuse for the Wikipedos to ban him. Doug was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents/DougsTech indefinitely blocked] in probably the surest sign of Wikipedo faggotry ever. Will Doug be able to hold on to his pockets, or will the Wikipedos finally reveal their Jew? See [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents/DougsTech]]

{{squote|I am currently blocked from editing. I opposed some admins, so they came at me with a [[At least 100|ton of deletions and blocks]]. Don't ever make an admin mad, they will use their tools against policy to silence or get rid of you, just because they don't like you. Overall, I was [[Successful troll is successful|successful in my goals]]. The 2 goals I set were - remove bad administrators, keep bad users from becoming administrators. [[Win|At least 1 bad administrator was removed, and countless others kept from being promoted.]]|DougsTech- [http://www.webcitation.org/5hA1OVCAb continues to troll] admins on his own talk page after being blocked by [[faggot|Sandstein]]}}

Well after much deliberation it seems the Wikipedos have succeeded in banning this "user". The Wikipedos are no doubt [[Gay sex|celebrating]]. However, there will always be someone there to take his place.

==How you can help==
#[[Wikipedia:Special:CreateAccount|Register an account]]
#Make a [[Huggle|bunch of vandal reversions]]
#Go to [[Wikipedia:WP:RFA|WP:RFA]]
#'''Oppose''' Too many administrators currently. <sup>[[Wikipedia:User:DougsTech/RFAreason|see here]]</sup> <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>
#If you ever get questioned about your voting; just post [[:Image:Too_Many_Admins.jpg|this image]]
Be sure not to forget step 2, as this will get you banned. See [[Wikipedia:User:Myownusername#Sockpupet_investigation|This dude]], a user that the Wikipedos found an excuse to ban when he agreed with Doug.

== A better way to help ==

Following the instructions above will get you banned because copying DougsTech exactly makes it obvious what you're doing. The left-wing freedom-of-speech nuts at Wikipedia will defend, to the death, your right to be a dick on the internet if you do this right, so don't screw it up.

#[[Wikipedia:Special:CreateAccount|Register an account]]
#Make a [[Huggle|bunch of vandal reversions]]
#Go to [[Wikipedia:WP:RFA|WP:RFA]]
#'''Oppose''' ''insert your flawed logic here''*. <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>
# If you ever get questioned about your voting claim that you are an editor like everyone else and are entitled to your opinions.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Knowing what to oppose with is a problem. In the past "Too many administrators currently" has worked and so has "I view self-noms as prima facie evidence of power hunger". Come up with something original, but still completely bullshit and oppose every RFA for it. Something like "Wikipedia should not have administrators, everyone should be equal" would go down perfectly and all the usual naive losers (such as LessHeard vanU, iridescent, A Nobody and Frank) will stand up to support you. And if you really want to do it right, disrupt some other process like Articles for Deletion so you cause damage without attracting high profile attention.

{{squote|I don't know how effective [[encyclopedia dramatica]] is at recruiting people, but they are now trying to find people to follow in Doug's footsteps. They are asking people to make a few vandalism reversions, go to RFA, then to [[Profit|use the template of Doug's]]. [[Dumbass|I'm pretty sure Doug has nothing to do with this though.]] [[User:Myveryownsock|Some of their editors]] are calling Doug "a hero to us all."|[[Faggot|Landon1980]] ([[wikipedia:User talk:Landon1980|talk]]) 04:33, 10 May 2009 (UTC)}}
