Boston
'''Boston''', OR '''BAWWSTAWN''' AS A LOCAL MIGHT SAY, is [[America]]'s tenth largest metropolitan area and one of its two primary technology hubs, the other being the equally gender-confused faggy [[San Francisco]]. As such, it is filled with [[nerd]]s, [[geek]]s, [[hipster]]s, [[Retard|bandwagoners]], and [[artfag]]s. It is home to much nerdy [[fail]] such as [[LARP]]ing, [[Wicca|Neo-pagan religion]], [[Aspie|ass-pie meetup groups]], and [[Web_2.0|stupid web startups]].

The original population of Boston was primarily made up of drunken [[Irish|paddys]] with excessive crotch fruit employed by rich snobby [[WASP]]s and their well-educated trust fund brat offspring. Boston still contains many [[Irish]] [[Catholic]]s and rich white [[WASP]] [[douchebag]]s.

[[Image:Mayflower.jpg|thumb|The Mayflower lands on Plymouth Rock and brings hundreds of wannabe technology startup founders.]]

The [[whitey|rich white WASP fucks]] of Boston started many colleges and universities, most notably [[MIT]] and [[Harvard|Hahvud]]. This brought a flood of [[nerd]]s and [[geek]]s who came and settled and bred [[aspie]] offspring who [[fap]] to [[Hentai]].

==History==
[[Image:Molasses.jpg|thumb|right|Boston got [[pwned]] by [[Shit|Molasses]] in 1919.]]

[[Faggotry]] and [[troll]]ability are deeply rooted in Boston dating back [[at least 100]] years when, in a [[miltopia|raging hissy-fit]], a bunch of [[idiot|Bostonians]] dumped a bunch of tea into the [[what|Boston Hahbah]] to protest being [[pwnt]] by the [[King]] of [[England]], who was [[anal sex|taxing]] they asses [[for great justice]]. This [[vandalism|tantrum]] became known as '''The Boston Tea Party'''.

Shortly after they'd slept that [[bender]] off they started [[butthurt|whining]] and [[cry|whining]] about not having won a World Series because of [[herpes|The Curse of the Bambino]], which refers to the complete and utter [[fail]]ure of their [[sport|baseball]] 'team' (the [[tranny|Boston Red Stockings]]) to win a [[Jew gold|World Series Championship]] after the team's owner sold their star player, the [[an hero|legendary]] [[fat girl angle shot|Babe 'The Bambino' Ruth]], to the [[New York]] [[GNAA|Yankees]] so he could finance the [[faggotry|Broadway musical]] '''"No, No Nannette"'''. As a result, the Red Sox became the Yankees' [[bitch]]es for life [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankees-Red_Sox_rivalry].

In conclusion, 80% of Bostonians are [[nerd]]s and [[fag]]s and the remaining are [[pedophile]] [[Catholic]] priests and drunken [[Irish|paddys]].

==The Local Dialect: Bostonics==

==Sports==
[[Image:Cameramot.JPG|thumb|right|A common tool in Boston sports]]

Boston is home to fowah professional teams: the Bawstin Red Sux, the New England [[Patriots]],the Boston Bruins, and the Boston [[irish|Celtics]].

The Boston Red Sox once sucked due to the [[herpes|Curse of the Bambino]] (see History) but have now got a Jewish owner who is dishing out money and overpaying Puerto Ricans to be a decent team. The Celtics were good for one year, but it is now known that their best players are bitch made old men who have no testicles. The New England Patriots' fans believe that they are the best team ev-uh. Many [[lulz]] are had at this, because every sane football watcher knows that the Patriots can't win without cheating.

Boston's sports teams are really not all that great, but their fans [[retard|seem to think so]]. Their fans are possibly the most obnoxious sports fans evar and can be seen drunkenly declaring that the Red Sox/Patriots/Bruins/Celtics are amazing and that every other team in the world sucks. They also believe that anyone who finds them [[truth|annoying]] is simply [[lolwut|jealous.]]

==Boston Neighborhoods==
[[Image:Mattapan.jpg|thumb|right|Mattapan. [[No|Lovely place, isn't it]]?]]
Each Boston neighborhood has its own unique personality. Here's a not-complete list:
*'''Beacon Hill''': This is where rich trust fund kid [[douchebag]]s go to spend their parents money on overpriced apartments while they study advanced graduate level basket weaving at Hahvahd. This is also where old uptight WASPs live such as [[John Kerry]], 2004 presidential candidate and [[douchebag]].
*'''The Financial District''': The financial district is an area of downtown which by day hosts most of Boston's banks and financial institutions. By night it's full of hoochie clubs where meatheads from Boston College and BU go to find willing sperm recepticles.
*'''Boston Common''': Pathetic imitation of [[New York|Central Park]] and site of the [[Boston Fail Party]], surrounded by overpriced high-rise condos full of [[Yuppie]]s.
*'''Chinatown''': [[Chinese|You orda egg roll chop suey!]]  Warning: now half Vietnamese, so they might ''kill'' your ass with a punji stick.
*'''Fenway''': Part college ghetto, part yuppie hell, and also home to where the Red Sox play ball. Being where Fenway Pahk is, its home to a lot of bahs where drunk meatheads scream "Red Sox!" or "Patriots!" and then throw up on the sidewalk later. One of its most fascinating attractions is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Bay_Fens The Fens]. By day this is a public park and garden where old farts can tend small rented out garden plots. By night this is where you go if you want a gino with shelack in his hair to polish your knob for $20.
*'''Dorchester''': black persons.
*'''Mattapan''': black persons.

*'''Jamaica Plain''': Jamaica Plain (known as "JP" to locals) is full of [[artfag]]s, [[hippie]]s, and [[lesbian]]s. The lesbians like to hang out at a local ice cream parlor and coffee shop called [http://www.jplicks.com/ JP Licks]. There is no pun intended in that name, you dirty fuck.
*'''Quincy''': Pronounced "Kwin-zee" by locals because they are retahded, Quincy is home to mostly massholes who speak Bostonics and [[Azn]]s who drive [[ricer]] cahs with fart cans on the tailpipe. It's also where fresh off the boat people from Chinatown go when they make enough money to not live in an 8x8 closet in Chinatown with 500 other FOBers.
*'''Westin''': [[WASP]]s.
*'''Newton''': [[WASP]]s with children named "Zachary" who play [[Buttsecks|Lacrosse]].

*'''Wellesley''': [[WASP]]s and Wellesley College, the all-girls WASP-larvae school where [[Hillary Clinton]] licked [[Bush]] (see Fuck Truck below)
*'''Allston''' and '''Brighton''': Notorious college ghetto home to binge drinking meatheads that go to BU, Boston College, or any one of Boston's other 1x10^36 universities. These neighborhoods are known for being ground zero in Boston's recent bedbug epidemic, which resulted from broke-ass college kids trading mattresses and sheets and couches and bodily fluids on [[Craigslist]]. Vomit and dog shit can be found on the sidewalks, while the streets are lined with college ghetto apartments, cheap chinese food joints, and bahs that cater to frat guy morons and sorority hoez.
*'''East Boston''': [[Catholic]] [[Irish|paddys]] that bear forth crotch fruit.
*'''South Boston / Southie''': Was once full of [[Irish|Paddys]] but is now full of [[Yuppie]] scumbags and [[artfag]]s and [[hipster]]s who thought it would be cool to move there after they saw "Good Will Hunting." Parts are still full of [[Irish]] [[Catholics]] and occasionally get stabby.
*'''Revere''': Pronounced "reveah," this neighborhood is full of locals and stupid [[wigger]]s who drive [[ricer]] cars. It features Reveah Beach, which may rival the picturesque beaches of northern [[New Jersey]] for whores and fat guys in speedos. This is one of the few neighborhoods where a [[Mullet]] can be sighted in the wild.
*'''Malden''': Local Massholes.
*'''Longwood''': Location of [[Harvard]] Medical School where evil mad scientists and Jews create transgenic monsters.
*'''Everett''': Local Massholes and the Mystic River which is where the mafia dumps people who don't use union labor. The AFL-CIO has a building on "Maffa Way."

*'''North End''': [[Italy|Ginos]] and [[Eurofag]]s and literally hundreds of Italian restaurants.
*'''Salem''': Site of the Salem Witch Trials and now home to [[Pagan]]s, [[wicca|Wiccans]], and [[LARP]]ing.

==Cambridge==
[[Image:Y_combinator.jpg|thumb|Actual tattoo on arm of Cambridge resident, depicting a common computer science theorem called a Y-combinator.]]
Cambridge is directly to the north of Boston across the Chahles Rivah. It's technically a separate city and smugly considers itself better than Boston, even though everyone who doesn't live there doesn't give a rat's ass and just calls it Boston. Cambridge also considers itself too cool to speak Bostonics.

Cambridge is home to [[MIT]] and [[Harvard|Hahvahd]] and a huge number of [[nerd]]s, [[geek]]s, overeducated academics, smug [[hippie]]s with pony tails, and [[hipster]]s. It's ground zero for Boston's infestation of nerdiness and over-educated academic smug.

Half of Cambridge's population is attending college, usually on their parents' money or their trust fund. The other half of Cambridge is trying to start at least one web or technology startup. Cambridge desperately wants to be Silicon Valley but suffers from the problem of not being in [[California]] and being under feet of fucking snow for half the year. Another issue that directly relates to it not being in California is the inadequate supply of hallucinogenic [[drugs]] which results in its nerds not becoming cool and not getting laid. Serious attempts are underway to address this issue (see below).

Cambridge itself has a number of distinct neighborhoods, including:
*'''Kendall Square''': Home of MIT and a million technology startups. Nerds walk the streets openly and without fear of persecution. Kendall Square is also home to a lot of pretentious egotistical businessmen and venture capitalist assholes attempting to make money off the technology industry while shoving [[cocaine]] up their nose.
*'''Central Square''': Between MIT and Hahvahd, Central Square is home to nerds and college students as well as a lot of [[hipster]]s and [[artfag]]s. Dirty bums can be found near the Central Square T (subway) stop as well as gutter punks and teenie boppers attempting to be cool. There are clubs in Central Square where [[eurofag]] [[techno]] may be heard.
*'''Harvard Square''': Where trust fund kids go during the "acquire pretentious degree" phase of their life cycle. You can also find bums here with Ph.Ds who will lecture you about UFO propulsion. Independent bookstores fester here.
*'''Harvard Square "Pit"''': A hang spot where the dregs of society go to contract drug habits and STD's.  
*'''North Cambridge''': nerds with children who need more than one bedroom, and a small population of [[beaner]]s
*'''East Cambridge''': Where pretentious nuevo-rich [[yuppie]] assholes live in overpriced [[cocaine]] pad condos.
*'''Porter Square''': nerds, a few Japanese people, a lot of [[weeaboo]]s, and startups that can't afford to be in Kendall Square.

Cambridge is the home of [[GNU]], the free software cult. Beneath Cambridge are tunnels where [[geek]]s sit in front of old computers running [[Linux]] or [[BSD]] and bang out software for free. Periodicially they must be fed raw meat and [[Piss|Mountain Dew]] lest they come to the surface to take their fill of human flesh.

==The Fuck Truck==
[[Wikipedia:Wellesley_College_Senate_Bus|The Fuck Truck]] is officially known as the Wellesley College Senate Bus, a bus that runs almost 24/7 between [[MIT]], [[Harvard|Hahvahd]], and [[lesbian|Wellesley College]]. Wellesley College is where [[Whitey|WASP]]s send their female larvae to acquire a pretentious degree, so the purpose of The Truck is to mix their genetic material with MITers and Hahvahd students with high future earning potential.

The mixing of WASP genes from Wellesley with anti-social nerds from MIT results in a spectacularly large population of people with [[Aspies|Aspergers Syndrome]] in the Boston metro area.

==Lack of Drugs==
[[Image:Stick_in_butt.gif|thumb|LSD is proven to dissolve sticks up peoples' butts, making them less uptight and more cool.]]
Cambridge, as mentioned above, desperately wants to be Silicon Valley. In a $10 million study undertaken by Harvard University, the primary barriers to becoming Silicon Valley were identified to be:
*Cambridge is not in [[California]]
*Snow
*No [[Apple|Steve Jobs]]
*Inability of [[nerd]]s to get laid, [[fap|fapping]]
*Cold
*No [[Valleywag]]
*No [[Burning Man]]
*[[LARP]]ing
*Snow

In a $5 million followup study funded by the Massachusetts Department of Economic Development, the issues involving California and snow were found to be insurmountable. However, several other issues were found to have their root cause in an insufficient supply of hallucinogenic [[drugs]]. In particular, a study involving volunteers from MIT in Cambridge and its counterpart Stanford University in Silicon Valley found in that withholding LSD from [[nerd]]s and [[Aspie]]s resulted in an inability to get chicks and uncontrollable [[fap|fapping]] to weird fetish [[pr0n]] on [[4chan]].

As a result, Massachusetts residents voted in 2008 by a 2:1 margin for an emergency ballot measure to partially decriminalize small quantities of [[Marijuana]]. This provides a short-term solution, but lawmakers are still discussing long-term solutions for importing a greater amount of [[San Francisco]] smug into the Boston metro area.

==The MBTA or "T"==
[[Image:ChahlieCahd.jpg|thumb|The Chahlie Cahd, debit card for the T system.]]
The T is Boston's local subway/train/bus transit system. Its real name is the [http://www.mbta.com/ MBTA], the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. The T is a creaking old mess of obsolete and outdated subway tunnels dug by cheap [[Chinese]] labor in the 19th century. It stops running at 12:30 so that all the attendees of the local bahs can be [[anal sex|buttraped]] by the local taxi drivers who charge ridiculously high fares. The T system is run by fat smelly union guys with no neck whose principal source of nourishment is Dunkin Donuts coffee.

The T features live performers, especially around rush hour and late at night. T performers are usually dirty bums playing the harmonica, the recorder, or the kazoo. [[Hippie]]s with acoustic guitars singing about [[butthurt|social injustice]] and dirty gutter punks drumming on upside down discarded cat litter buckets are also common.

The main T system is composed of four main light rail lines:
*'''The Red Line''', so named because it goes to Hahvahd whose color is red. The red line is full of [[nerd]]s and [[Yuppie]]s and such. Actual conversation overheard on the red line: "so, I hate when people think that quantum computing somehow invalidates the question of NP completeness..."
*'''The Orange Line''' is full of black persons and smelly bums and [[artfag]]s who live in Jamaica Plain.
*'''The Green Line''', also known as the "school bus," is an ancient creaking trolley full of drunk obnoxious [[college]] students going to Brighton and Allston. Watch for bedbugs and [[herpes]].
*'''The Blue Line''' goes to East Boston and Reveah (see neighborhood list above) and terminates at a farking dog track

The T has a unique and highly recognizable [[Ass|smell]] that is available in perfume, cologne, and air freshener form at the "I Love Boston" store at Logan International Airport.

==The Terrorist Attacks of 1/31==
[[Image:Boston_Mayor_Thomas_"Mumbles"_Menino.jpg|thumb|Four-time Boston Mayor Thomas [http://www.mumblesmenino.us/ "Mumbles" Menino] speaks in an indecipherable dialect called [[ENGLISH_MOTHERFUCKER_DO_YOU_SPEAK_IT|"Mumbonics"]].]]
On [[ATHF Terrorist Attack|1/31/2007]] (never forget), a bunch of dirty [[hippie]] viral marketing morons put lite brites up all over Boston depicting the Mooninites from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. As a result, the "T" and the main transportation arteries of Boston were shut down for an entire day.

The [[butthurt]] was so severe that [[whitey|the local Boston populus]] and mayor "Mumbles" Menino accused the [[Adult Swim|Cartoon Network]], the [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]], and the [[New York]] [[Yankees]] of being [[Al Qaeda|FOO (Friends of Osama)]] [[terrorist|operatives]] trying to make [[tubes|The Big Dig]] fall down even more. They then said "[[OMFG]]Z!!! [[YHBT|WHBT]] by [[herpes|The Curse of The Bambino]]!!!."  In their defence, it must be said that Boston's hold on existence is so tenuous and tentative that it is [[Research|conceivable]] that one good prank ''might'' cause the whole place to vanish, or fall into the sea.  One can only hope.
<br><br><br><br>

==The Big Dig==
Boston was the site of a [[Unlimited disposable income|hugely expensive]] [[ghetto|Urban Renewal]] project to overhaul the city's mass transit system called [[tubes|The Big Dig]] which -in part- created great [[lulz]] from time-to-time for everyone in the rest of the country when parts of it fell on [[niggers|people]] driving into the still under construction tunnels. This took place because [[Jews|greedy capitalists]] decided it would be cheaper to just glue the bolts in with epoxy than to pay a big burly, smelly union worker with no neck to twist them into nuts on the other side of the concrete slab with a wrench.

On July 10, 2006, [[over 9,000]] tons of concrete fell from the ceiling of the Interstate 90 connector and onto a car, killing an immigrant. A massive, 900 million dollar investigation was conducted, adding to the 10 billion dollar debt of the Big Dig.
