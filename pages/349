'''Alexis Pilkington Syndrome''' <s>is</s> was an [[Attention Whore|attention whoring]] disorder that is characterized by [[trolling]] a dead [[Teenager|teen girl]] named Alexis Pilkington whose [[Memorial Page Tourism|memorial tribute page]] on [[Failbook|Facebook]] was created by her so-called [[friends]].  According to her [[Incest|family]] and [[Friends|close friends]], '''Alexis Sky Pilkington''' or known as '''Lexi''' apparently are very [[Butthurt|upset]] about the trolling. It was confirmed that these attention whores also troll on her [[Formspring]] when she was alive and was possibly the cause for her death. No one knows for sure. The '''Alexis Pilkington Syndrome''' could also mean everything that's wrong with the Internets as the victim du jour for anti-[[cyber bully]]ing activists. The Facebook memorial page for Alexis was the Internets' most popular destination for [[memorial page tourism]] until the creators decided to [[Don't feed the trolls|not feed the attention whores]] by [[Baleet|deleting]] the page altogether. 

According to the [[attention whores]], Alexis accidentally died in March 2010 from [[autoerotic asphyxiation]] and then became [[IRL]] and [[Internet famous]] as a retroactive victim to [[griefer]]s from [[ebaums]] who mercilessly trolled her memory [[OTI]].  The anti-[[cyber bully]]ing activists confirmed how Alexis died which was hanging.  Her Facebook page gained [[wikipedia:Cyber-bullying#Community_support|notability]] for the vicious trolling it took post-mortem -a trolling her parents, Thomas and Paula exacerbated by [[old media|going national]] to discuss the [[cyber bullies]] who had already fucked with her albeit minimally on [[formspring]]. 

Paula did not actually know what a [[troll]] was before Alexis died because unlike losers like [[Megan Meier]] who are [[asking for it]], Lexi wasn't particularly unpopular. It was only after her [[self-pwn]]age that her mom was made [[butthurt|painfully aware]] that a troll is -amongst [[raidfag|other things]]- someone who is a heartless, remorseless "[[emotional terrorist]]" who uses [[banana]]s as a weapon.

==The Real Story from her [[Incest|family]]==
{{quote|Unfortunately, since Lexi took her own life on March 21st, 2010, it is now quite apparent she was also ill and had been masking a deep dark depression for some time.  Sadly, her death has brought a great deal of pain that we will carry in our hearts forever.  However, it is also true that with her death, Lexi brought hope to others.  By being an organ donor she has saved and or improved the lives of many.  Her tragic story and beautiful memory has inspired a new sense of togetherness and healing within the West Islip community.  In addition, as per the numerous letters and emails we have and still continue to receive, it is apparent she has touched lives across the globe.|[[Incest|Alexis Pilkington's loving family]]|Mom, Dad and Jared}}   

==Alexis's history as told by the attention whores==

[[File:Alexispilkington.jpg|thumb|left|[[Auto-erotic_asphyxiation|What really happened]]]]
{{quote|I blame her family. If they were there for her when she needed them then she wouldn't have killed herself. I guess the neglectful bastards just didn't notice she wanted to DIE. I bet her family are sitting there celebrating her death right now while you all bunch of cry baby fags complain. Lighten up, the bitch got what she wanted right?|Sarah Simpson|Facebook}}

Prior to her [[suicidal|''real'' issue]] surfacing, Alexis was a fairly normal popular girl who had been sent to counseling for "[[drunk|normal teen issues]]" like occasionally cutting class and incomplete homework.  Oh yeah, and an unhealthy obsession with [[David Carradine]], [[wikipedia:Michael_Hutchence#Death|INXS]] and [[autoerotic asphyxiation]]. Clearly, her actual problem was her [[parents]] and she was only 'troubled' in the sense that she came from a disfunctional family who thought that hating school wasn't normal teenage behaviour. Plus, imagine having a cop as a dad. Cops are as dickish to their kids as they are to perps; maybe more-so because they patrol them and their bedrooms 24/7. Fuck that shit...kids are gonna [[drugs|be kids]].

To her parents, she was a [[unrealistic expectations|happy, beautiful and brilliant kid with unlimited potential]] who was on her way to graduating early and a perfect, fulfilling happy life filled with [[rich and beautiful|success and riches]]. However, in reality, teens who graduate early are usually those who hate school and want to GTFO as soon as possible so they can leave home and their horrible, overbearing [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-rock/has-an-incorrect-theory-o_b_526536.html coddling parents who relentlessly push their kids] to be all the things that they could never hope to be or achieve. 

According to friends, Alexis not only hated school and her parents but [[emo|couldn't take the pressure of being the "good kid"]] so she decided to graduate life early without leaving a [[I DIDN'T EAT THAT FUCKIN SANDWICH OR THE TOILET THING EITHER!|suicide note]]. However, she did leave something: hours of amusement for [[ebaums]] and employment to dozens of pundits and [[Internets expert]]s who swarm the the [[CNN|24/7 newscycle]] to enlighten [[shocked and appalled]] viewers and [[concerned parents]]. 

[[Ironically]] Alexis Pilkington will be remembered not for anything she did or didn't do in her young life, but for the extensive legacy and impressive [[butthurt|body of work]] she leaves behind in the field of [[trolling]] [[OTI]] ''and'' [[IRL]] but moar importantly in [[Schadenfreude]] -the concept that [[lulz]] at the expense of others is not only a natural human condition but actually good for you. 

Apart from that, as an organ donor, Alexis leaves behind her pert, tight little soccer player derriere for [[Bill Nye|scientists]] to experiment on in the ongoing search for a soothing balm for those with chronic, persistent viral [[butthurt]] -most of whom are her so-called 'friends':selfish [[attention whoring]] shrill [[lolcows]] who have ensured that Alexis Pilkington will [[nevar forget|never be forgotten]] as a [[drama-generating technique]] and eternally [[e-famous]] as a [http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=%22alexis+pilkington%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 search result] in the age of [[Google]].

==The Trolling==
{{notice|'''RIP-Alexis-Pilkington''': I made a AIM account and her REAL FRIENDS can im it and write a memory or something to her. INCLUDE YOUR NAME! I am going to print out the im's and make a book with all the memories and give it to her parents and give copies with pictures and such to close friends â™¥ '''the aim is - alexispilkington''' - }}

Whilst still in the land of the living, Alexis was minorly butthurt over some [[flaming]] she took on her [[formspring]] account but dealt with it by [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|deleting the offending questions]] and thenceforth, refused to play [[the game]], knowing full-well that you can maintain the upper hand if you [[don't feed the trolls]]. 

{{quote|I'm not answering or posting any more of the mean questions, though people! Its messed up :(|lexiskye17}}

Her moron friends, however, weren't as Internets savvy and turned an otherwise boring, cliched, smalltown [[self-pwn]]ing/[[David Carradine|sexytime experiment]] gone awry into a major media shitstorm in an otherwise [[Nancy Grace|slow news cycle]].

This, in turn, set the [[blogosphere]] afire and caught the attention of the [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE]], whose [[white knights|vigilant young men]] take such matters very [[SERIOUS BUSINESS|seriously]] and decided that [[Facebook Memorial Pages|such madness]] was a "[[Streisand Effect|teachable moment]]" for concerned parents everywhere. Indeed, Lexi's mother got the message loud and clear: friends don't lets friends drive the information superhighway, drunk on [[USI]].

Other clued-in [[memorial page tourists]], also thanked [[Anon]]:

{{quote|Lovely Group. Memorial page tourism is way up and continues to grow. So much love, remembrance, vial hatred and most of all comical nonsense of considering a facbook page SACRED ~ !Ha !|Aki Mutsumi |Facebook}}

But it was too late for Lexi's so-called friends who ignored the [[facepalm|writing on the wall]] and continued to allow comments on their memorial page including expressions of [[lulz|pleasure over the death]], with pictures of what seemed to be [[LOL WUT|a banana]] as their profile pictures.

{{tinyquote|This whole thing seems more about trolls winning or losing than somebodies memory. If that's the case, you'll never beat those guys from [[4chan]]. How could any regular ol' nice person beat somebody posting on a dead person's page, "LOLZ BITCH PROBABLY SUCKS A GOOD COCK STILL." What are you going to say "HEY RESPECT HER MEMORY!" They'll probably fire back with something about anal.|Joe InternLovebuzz Randazzo|Facebook}}

Meanwhile, Lexi's dad, a New York City cop (who obviously knows a thing or two about [[Abner Louima|the law]]), was not in synch with his wife and is threatening legal action against the Internets.

{{quote|If I have to be the complainant in [[lolsuit|a criminal proceeding]], then I would be.|Thomas Pilkington|father}}

Good luck with that Tom. You'd have moar luck suing her retarded, [[USI|self-serving]] 'friends' instead. [[Long Island]] is full of rich white people who you can mine for [[jewgolds]] for what?...a fancy new headstone for your only child? A child you may as well have tied the noose for with all your bad parenting?

===Trolling YouTube Comments===

'''[[DISREGARD THAT|ilovetwijonas â€” 23 March 2010 â€” ALL RUDE COMMENTS WILL BE DELETED. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO TALK CRAP ABOUT SOMEONE WHO RECENTLY PASSED AWAY. Thank you.]]''' Of course, it never occurred to the [[lolcow]] who made this vidya that you can disable comments.
