[[Image:Fake editor.jpg|thumb|right|240px|You are not permitted to laugh. Ever.]]
<b>Wikipedia</b>'s '''Do Not Laugh At EncyclopediaDramatica''' policy outlines what you are permitted and are not permitted to laugh at. The good admins here at Wikipedia have decided what you can laugh at - because you don't know yourselves, worthless fuckers. Not following this official Wikipedia policy will result in a ban and/or getting assraped.

<center>'''''Our goal here at Wikipedia is to brainwash you into not having even a shred of a sense of humor. We aim to fuck with your brain so much that [[Uncyclopedia]] will seem hilarious to your destroyed intellect.</center>

While we cannot physically sit at your computer and monitor your web-browsing, we can install wave upon wave of trojans and keyloggers in order to monitor what you are looking at, and fry your box if you even think of going near [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].

You have no say in this matter. Wikipedia is not a democracy, it is a dictatorship headed by [[Jewbo Wales]]. Please feel welcome to work our fields while you complain and bitch, serf.

==Activities prohibited by this Policy==
*You must never, ever enjoy yourself;
*You may not visit any site that is amusing in the slightest;
*You must never argue with any of our admins on this matter;

==Consequences for not following this guideline==
*[[Rape|Assrape]];
*[[pwnt|Computer rape]], courtesy of Wikipedia's [[skript kiddie]]z;
*[[Permaban|Indefinite ban]];

<small>By registering an account on Wikipedia you accept these terms, and acknowledge that there will be severe [[butthurt|consequences]] for breaking these ironclad rules.</small>
