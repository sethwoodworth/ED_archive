Red Hat
[[Image:Carmen.jpg|right|thumb|International thieves extraordinaire.]]

In the [[Linux]] world, '''Red Hat''' is king.  No one does a better job of suckering people to buy a [[free]] product than Red Hat.  Most Linux distributions are based on Red Hat somehow.  [[Sun Microsystems]] hates Red Hat, and has made [[Solaris]] free because no one wants to pay money for something that is just as good, but can be had for free.  This is despite the fact that you actually have to pay money for a decent-working Linux from Red Hat.

Red Hat produces two primary distributions: [http://fedoraproject.org/ Fedora] and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).  While Fedora is free, nothing works and it will destroy your computer.  Only the [[fucktarded]] use Fedora.  On the other hand, RHEL actually works but you have to pay lots of money for it, and only big, gigantic corporations actually bother doing it.  Yet, because Red Hat is stupid enough to include source code in RHEL, other companies give it away for free.  Anyone who bothers paying for RHEL is an idiot.

<del>[[Alan Cox]] and Havoc Pennington work for Red Hat.</del> [[Alan Cox]] is now at [[Intel]], working with them to make sure running [[Linux]] will fry your CPU.<br />
Havoc Pennington was finally [[baleet|shitcanned]] after he [[Fail|fucked up]] enough projects at Red Hat e.g. [[Mugshot]] and is now working somewhere else as a [[Prostitute|developer]].

Red Hat is also the only reason people use [[GNOME]], the world's [[bullshit|most functional and feature-rich]] window manager.

==Origin of the Company Name==

Red Hat was named after [[Richard Stallman]]'s penis.  The head of his [[cock]] is said to be big and red -- that if you could cut it off, you could wear it on your head like a hat.  This, of course, has become a metaphor for how much Red Hat sucks, and why using any Red Hat-produced Linux is a form of castration. Which of course does little to differentiate it from the rest of Linux because all Linux distros are total fucking failures.

==Fedora 8 Release==

Initial impression of Fedora 8: "HAY GUYZ I'M A HAT"

==Other uses==
Not to be confused with the Red Hat Cult.
