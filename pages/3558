Among the plenty [[4chan|shitholes]] that is the [[interwebs]], new Jewfags find ways to troll like any other dick [[cum|wad]].
'''Kyle S.''', aka '''HEYITSKYLEE''', began his trolling on the shitty [[pirate|music/movie/pr0n]] site http://www.strikegently.com only to annoy the fuck out of [[you]]

==Strike What?==


<b> StrikeGently </b> is a [[newfag]] site where everyone waits around all day to scream [[first post]] and request [[emo|shitty]] [[rap|albums]] and [[dildo|porn]].
[[IRL|In reality]], strikegently leaks random albums, pointless [[porn]], and [[unfunny]] images. This generally consists of making a royal fuckton posts of juggalos, [[Blood on the Dance Floor]], and [[boobs]]. At its [[apple|core]] SG [[trolls]] its self and users in generally [[b]] ways.  (for example [http://strikegently.com/?p=54365|] or [http://strikegently.com/?p=58590])

AKA it's a site for Computer Science users who don't know about [http://www.torrenst.to|"this"] or [[google|"that"]].

==HEYITSFUCKYOU==


Like most [[anon]] users, HEYITSKYLEE tried to stand his dick above the rest and as such, he was the first to add his [[dildo|gayfag]] image with his [[camwhore|gf]] after strike gently [[DOS|upgraded]].
With that, Kyle spent [[basement dwellers|countless hours]] posting on every [[fucking]] [[post]] possible.  

With his [[cool|comments]] that tried to boost his [[emo|self-esteem]], he constantly tried to act like a BAMF while troll'n the several anon regulars.

As such, SG began to troll his twitter in really [[retarded]] ways by claiming he was a jew like he was. [http://strikegently.com/?p=54964] [http://strikegently.com/?p=55137]

==AN HERO!?==
And so great [[happy|joy]] and reasonable doubt was felt when SG posted another [[death]] post in vain of their troll post of [[BrokeNCYDE]]'s car accident [http://strikegently.com/?p=51850] and the lulz to follow [http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100616185157AA35369|lulz]

This time, it was the Troll itself proclaiming its leave with a failed [[suicide]].  SG responded with a [[fail|post]] mocking his death.  Of course the comments were [[boobs|bursting]] with confusion and [[white knights]] that proclaimed the death was real.

{{quote|If you really think he’s trolling, why don’t you take a look at his obituary? http://bit.ly/clBrbn | '''MarcSavesLives''' - gay fag}}

{{quote|You guys have no souls if you aren’t feeling the least bit sorry or respectful towards him. Even if you think he was a douche or a cunt, he still deserves some respect. How would you feel if people said they were glad your friend or family member died? | '''MarcSavesLives'''}}


{{quote|hahha so many heyitskylee posers….I happen to know he is alive and well. i saw him yesterday while I was shopping at Baby Gap| ''Selena Gomez'' - no joke}}


==Loss of Boner==
After [[pedobear|hibernating]] for a few days, the troll returned to see if anyone had thought about him. 

{{quote|@matrocksteady  i meant to milk it a little longer, but i couldn't. got some interesting feedback though. http://tweetphoto.com/39492334|to another SG fag}}


Unfortunately, the answer is [[yes]]. 

As an epic [[fail]], he continues to run rampart on SG until someone [[rapes|helps]] us all.
