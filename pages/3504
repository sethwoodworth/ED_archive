Grudgewank
[[File:Cobainpostshotgunmouthwash.jpg|thumb|Technically [[masturbating]] to [[Kurt Cobain|this]] is also a grudgewank.]]

'''Grudgewank''' is that urge, that flaming desire that rises up in [[Homosexuals|some people]]. 

It is the urge to bring down someone or several someones because they made you [[Butthurt|hurt or offended]] over something that happened [[Last_Thursday|a long ass time ago.]]

== Signs of someone bearing Grudgewank ==
*A single incident magically becomes "all the time" or becomes an extreme, unforgivable crime that sparks an intense vendetta for no reason
*Making things up about the person(s) in question
*Making exaggerated claims of rightfulness to be hurt about made up things
*Telling everyone on your [[LiveJournal]] or [[MySpace]] blog about this incident, then rallying their support and feeding them more lies to keep them convinced
*Leading some kind of [[Attention whore|self-righteous crusade]] to [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|destroy everything]] you don't like, while everyone loses sight of what exactly started the grudgewank to begin with.
*Writing a [[shitty attack article]] on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].

Possible cures include ignoring wankers and acting pleasant instead of crying about it.

==[[Fantard]] Variant==

One common version of grudgewank is to instead hold an eternal hate towards some creative work and its creator. Rather than just quietly acknowledging they wasted two hours and a couple hundred megabytes of bandwidth pirating a movie and moving on with their lives, they instead make it their solemn duty to find every last avenue of discussion where they can bring it up as a topic so they can rant and rave about the evils of some shitty film.

While this would be acceptable if it was done [[for the lulz]], they're most emphatically serious about making sure they spread what they see to be the unalienable [[truth]] and correct strangers for having the wrong [[opinion]] on the internet. It is a sad and pathetic display of everything wrong about organized [[fandom]] made worse by the fact that at least the typical fantard basing their identity around [[Invader Zim|some shitty Nickelodeon OMG RANDOM cartoon]] at least have a positive association with their obsession. They then only become valuable as [[lol-cow]]s via [[White Knighting]] their hate object.
