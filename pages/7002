'''Ridin' Dirty''' refers to a [[game]] played between friends where points are earned for successfully having [[sex|sexual intercourse]] with disgusting and extremely [[obese]] [[women]]. Pictures must be taken with the whale to prove that [[sex|sexual intercourse]] actually took place. These women only qualify if their [[obese|obesity]] is comparable to the fat women featured in Spencer's gag cards. The winner receives a pre-set prize, typically money.

The Chamillionaire song "Ridin'" was created to commemorate a specific instance where the artist won this game by sexually pleasuring a morbidly [[fat|rotund]] transvestite. This event led to additional (bonus) points for Chamillionare which gave him a solid lead and eventually a [[win]] in a game between him and his friends.

"Friend1: Hey, if you mixed 50 Cent, Akon, T-Pain and a sewer rat together you know what you'd get? Chamillionaire! lol.
Friend2: Nah, Chamillionaire's uglier than that.
