Antigua and Barbuda
[[Image:island.jpg|thumb|God, why?!]]

A beautiful island paradise where Eric Clapton will send you if you get hooked on [[crack]]. Oh, no! Anything but that! He founded a drug rehab clinic on this Caribbean island after recovering from his [[alcohol]] and [[drug]] addiction. 

[[Britney Spears]] was sent there after going [[batshit insane]] and shaving her head but left the next day to become [[an hero]] with [[The Great Sonic-cide of 2007|bricks and knives]].
