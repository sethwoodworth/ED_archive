Internet DVD
So, you've made it big on the [[Internets]]. You've pulled together your [[MS Paint]] work and racked your brains for an [[porn|intellectual and subtly stimulating plot]]. But why stop there? Soon the sequels roll in, and you're ready to host your series on [[Newgrounds|Poogrounds]] or [[YouTube]], the height of Interweb [[popular|coolness]]. But what's left to do? Why, release a DVD of course!

== What is an Internet DVD? ==
An Internet DVD is just like an ordinary DVD, except the content is based on an Internet series created by [[fat]], filthy [[virgin|virgins]] who got kicked out of their parents [[basement]] for [[bestiality|fucking the dog]]. However, unlike a normal DVD, they can only be bought via the web, thus resulting in massive shipping fees and endless [[lulz]] for those watching. (Although the fact that people would buy such [[shit]] is funny alone.)

== Types of DVD ==
There are a few different types of Internet DVDs, but they all have the same thing in common; they are all a huge fucking waste of money, time and space.


* '''Type One'''
This is the kind of Internet DVD in which one hundred percent of the content is available on the web, even the special features.  Basically, the only difference between this DVD and the Internet is that you can watch it on your portable video player so [[your mom]] won't be able to hear them say [[fail|"FUCKING SHIT LOL SEX AND WILLIES"]] every eight seconds.


* '''Type Two'''
This type of DVD is slightly better, as it features episodes of the series which can't be found on the web, except in the likely event that they are stolen by [[Jews]] and put there. This forces the [[retard|fans]] to purchase the DVD for fifty bucks so they can see the one extra exclusive show.

[[Happy Tree Friends]] mastered the art of this after they released three DVDs with all the episodes split between them. Fans happily spend twenty dollars on each one, at which point the producers released a new DVD which contained every single thing on the previous three plus extra, for a lot less money. Sometime later, they released all the exclusive DVD episodes onto the Internet anyway. Levels of [[lulz|teen suicide]] exploded.


* '''Type Three'''
Amazingly, this DVD features new episodes and special features. It doesn't swindle the fans by releasing everything they spent money on into the main site. However, it is inevitably wasted on something like the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]] and the special features are nothing more than the number of times he says [[fuck]] in each episode.


* '''Type Four'''
That's right. Entirely new content. This type of Internet DVD is rare, and comes in the form of full lengh movies about tiny [[gay]] men having orgies on tables. Don't let the special features and original content fool you, it's still [[retarded]].

== Why are Internet DVDs so Awesome? ==

Because the [[Irate Gamer]] even says so on Amazon, when the stupid bastard reviews his own DVD, but is too retarded to create a sock puppet account to do so:

== In Conclusion ==
You chose to spend your money on this, when you could have bought [[whores]], [[drugs]] and/or happiness, then you seal your [[suicide|own fate]].
