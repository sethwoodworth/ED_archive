'''Hyperstudio''' is an edumacational tool created by [[Wikipedophile|wikipedophiles]] for fifth graders. Each stack contains a series of buttons and other navigation tools specifically designed to [[Goatse]] unsuspecting 10-year olds. It is common knowledge that by installing Hyperstudio on your computer, your house will be regularly broken into and your computer keyboard frothily [[masturbation|masturbated]] upon by child molesters and/or [[Gary Coleman]].

Hyperstudio was created one day in the jungle when two monkeys were having [[buttsechs]] and one of them forgot to wipe their ass after taking a [[shit]], so when the manlier of the monkeys pulled out, he had a large chunk of poop on his [[dick]]. He proceeded to wipe this poop off, and it was found later by [[Science|archaeologists]] and turned into an application for [[Apple|Mac OS 9]].

[[Last thursday]], when someone figured out that Hyperstudio was used for the purpose of [[Wikipedia|anal masturbation]], they banned it from schools everywhere and started using [[Microsoft|Microsoft Office]]. However, no child will [[Never forget|evar forget]] the day that the school told them they could no longer get a [[porn|real education]].
