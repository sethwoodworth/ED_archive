'''VenomFangX(moar like VenomFagX [[amirite?]])''', real name Shawn (or Shaun, or Sean or Isabelle (no one knows or cares)) Karon of Thornhill, Ontario, Canada, and also referred to as VFX, VenomFagX, or PCS (Posterboy for Creationist Stupidity) by Thunderf00t, is a 22-year-old [[Christian]] [[YouTube]] [[attention whore]] who <s>[[basement dweller|still lives with his parents]]</s>. He is recognizable by his infamous smug grin that would embarrass the [[Joker]]. His only goal in [[life]] is to prove that everything in the [[Bible]] is true and to [[ignore]] and [[censor]] anyone who believes otherwise (he likes to abuse the block user button on YouTube), and scam the mindless sheep who actually enjoy his vids by requesting Paypal donations for charitable causes (which he then gets busted for after Canadian law enforcement learns that he used it to buy a new car and pay for college tuition). He has been voted as one of the creepiest [[Christfags]] online and has [[twilight|amazing pale skin that shines]] in the camera and blinds [[intelligent]] people. He has a loyal following of about 4 [[YouTube]] [[whores]] (all of which are really just [[sockpuppet]]s of VenomFangX's) and he's well known for [[buttsecks]] with [[JezuzFreek777]]. 

The real sad truth about this individual is that he began his intelligencia masquerade by posing as an atheist several years prior to his YouTube postings. It can only be hypothesized that since he was unable to have [[Unrealistic expectations|sexual relations with members of the opposite sex]] (even most housepets avoid his touch), he turned to the only popular line of reasoning left to him as an excuse - posing as an [[fundie|evangelist]]. His methodology and reasoning have not changed a single iota since his transition from "God is gay" to "gay for God" and has achieved a level of [[shit]] comparable to a super religious and more irritating [[Tay Zonday]]. His videos ooze smug in such high concentrations you can smell the douchewater through your ethernet cable.)

He's scared of getting killed by Muslims and thinks that anyone or anything that disagrees with his literal interpretation of the [[bullshit|bible]] actually comes from [[Satan]]. It's often thought that he's a [[troll]] making fun of online Christians. But he really believes all the bullshit he steals from [[Kent Hovind]] videos (who is a flaming [[homosexual]] himself, who got his doctorate from known diploma mill "Patriot Bible University," and went to prison recently for the sole purpose of getting [[raped]] in the ass). He even [[lolwut|steals Kent Hovind's jokes]] ''[[Unfunny|("People often ask me if I think there is intelligent life on other planets. I say 'No, I don't think there's much intelligent life on this planet'"]],'' a joke in which [[Kent Hovind|Hovind]] is referring to himself.)

He secretly fantasizes about being a European living a [[100 years ago|few centuries ago]], when freedom of speech was far more limited and as an exceptionally white Christian male, he would never have to argue against twenty first century [[science|scientific discovery]] and [[common knowledge|common fucking knowledge]]. 

== Beliefs ==

=== Advice He Should Follow ===
{{ytplus|Is he talking into a mirror?|<youtube>ZghDp8cKjps</youtube>|"Everything You Say about The Bible and God...is Wrong"|-- If only he could get himself to listen to himself.}}

=== [[Fundamentalist|Evangelical]] [[Christianity]] ===
[[Image:VenomFangX34.jpg|right|thumb|VenomFangX ushers in the Second Cumming of Christ.]]
Shawn adheres to that wonderful offshoot of [[Christianity]] that is full of mindless, brainwashed followers who spend their entire life in misery when they aren't spreading the [[bullshit|gospel]]. And true to form, He believes that their religion is the only way of life and refuse to accept any other ways. As the rule of thumb goes, There is no "conversation" with Evangelicals...they only convert. Hence any debate done with him, is really an attempt at turning you into a [[christfag]].

=== Influences ===
Judging by his form of argumentation, you can tell that VenomfangX has been influenced by Kent Hovind, an American Young Earth creationist and UFO conspiracy theorist. Hovind is famous for creation magiks seminars that aim to convince morons to reject modern theories of evolution with "propaganda" such as his diploma mill PhD and shit that he completely made up off teh internets. as well as most of  NAMBLA. also the book "[[Gay|man boy love the young years vol. 67]]" he can also be found on efuckt fappin to jesus beef.

Another influence comes from Ray Cumfart's "[[way of the master|Way of the Masterbater]]", a series on [[Christfag]] conversion. More importantly what's known as the [[Good Person Test|Good Tranny Test]].
This leads him to predictable patterns of homosexual behavior and self breast augmentation (with a bicycle pump), which can be then exploited for the [[lulz]] or [[tits|bewbz]].

===[[Creationism]]===

{{quote|This page meets all criteria and requirements for use as teaching material within the State of Kansas public school system. It consists of facts, not of theories, and students are encouraged to believe it uncritically, and to approach alternatives critically.}}

His large collection of self-righteous religious bullshit can be found [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=VenomFangX here], and it's suggested watching for everyone who hates that one half remaining brain cell in his head. The primary source of lulz comes from his disproof of things like evolution and proof of god with facts like:
*dicks look like food.
*spooks look like SHIT.
*Sporks look like spoons.
*Whales have nipples.
*Photoshopped proof that giants walked the planet.
*Some random Hitler pron.
*His voice being really annoying and the only thing that would make it sound better would be the sound of his lips blowing a raspberry cumbubble on a rotten, unwiped asshole with the AIDSCANCER of GOATSE and Tom Serson.
*The Bible is true because it's a book with words and Darwin sucks [[Obama|Satan]]'s [[cock]].
*enjoys scat pron and eating his own shit.
*reads the NAMBLA handbook before bed then recites it to his group for recovering <s>addicts.</s>[[Faggots]].

=== VenomFangX Thinks That The Sun Revolves Around The Earth, and the Moon Revolves around his Cock ===
[http://www.Youtube.com/Kabane52 Kabane52] had a conversation with Shaun in which he admits that the [[lol wut|sun revolves around the Earth]]

<center>'''''VenomFagX Being Exposed For The Retard That He Is...for the over 9,000th time''''</center>
<center><youtube>vX0TEnRPbP4</youtube></center>

Kabane was smart enough to record the entire conversation *[http://www.freewebs.com/theisticevolution/debatewithvenomfangx.htm here]

[[Shit nobody cares about|<b>Interesting fact:</b> For ego-centrism to be true, meaning the stars revolve around the earth every day, the nearest star, Alpha Centauri, would have to be orbiting earth at a speed 10,000 times the speed of light.]]

[[Shit nobody cares about|<b>Pathetic fact:</b> Shaun believes egocentrism to be likely.]]

Anyone with a bit of common sense already know what a lying, hypocritical shittyfinger smelling retard Shawn is. However, hopefully Venom's "cult" followers will finally see this. Personally I think that either [[A frank discussion of mental illness|VenomFangX's lemmings]] will either ignore this piece of truthful information about their "[[Psychopath|leader]]" or once again make excuses for his homosexuality. or even better scream false prophet and hang him from teh internets masheen. we can only hope feel free to add any new info. 
'cuz i want to fuck him with a broken glass beer bottle and then pummel him into unconciousness with a Bible covered with rusty thumbtacks....and then post it on teh internets.

===About [[Islam]] ===
Despite the fact that it would be easier than killing a quadruple amputee with hemophilia, Shaun actually manages to fail at disproving Islam. Despite the many competent arguments in existence PCS has decided to play to his strengths and be an idiot, with such gems as....

* The Bible is older than the Quran, lol.
* The Bible has outsold the Quran and ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', combined.
* The Quran says Christianity isn't true (HOLY SHIT WHAT A FUCKING SURPRISE!)
* If you turn the Arabic symbol for "Allah" on his side, rub it out, [[divide by zero]] then write the letters S A T A N, it says "Satan". As you can clearly see, this means Allah is Satan.
* The Quran was written by smelly, brown foreigners in the Middle East, while the Bible was written by Jesus. Who was a White Aryan like he is in all the pictures. 

He dare not attack Islam at its weakest spot -- that it is a collection of stale lies about an invisible, angry, vengeful boogyman in the sky -- because such an argument can be applied to his God just as easily....and deep down in his reptile brain, be knows this. 

===About Amputees===
On the 13th of April, 2008, when asked a simple question concerning the [[handicapped]]. He replied with this little gem

{{ytplus|VFX, Lover of Humanity|<youtube>Xp6zhpcfWm8</youtube>|"Amputees don't deserve their Arms. We Deserve to Die. That's what the Bible Teaches. Sorry if You Don't Like That."|-- VFX, overflowing with the Love, Compassion and Charity of the Holy Spirit.}}

===[[Asking for it|E-begging]]===

In late September 2008, The poster boy for creationist stupidity, started an outstanding career in e-begging, starting with a brand new camera. This of course led him to go on to milk his [[fantards]] for his <s>ministry</s> [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Venomfangx#Website_and_Paypal_Scam| own ends]

==[[Censorship]]==

To go along with his complete and utter hatred of [[sex|anything that is good]] in the [[universe]], Shawn censors his channel with militant intolerance that makes George Orwell's [[1984]] look like the Bill of Right's happy place. Anyone who spams, swears, or even disagrees with him on his channel or on any of his videos will have their comments deleted and will immediately be blocked by VenomFangX. This is, of course, not without reason. His reasons for his [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinesque]] censorship are as follows:
* He is emotionally hurt by certain strings of letters, such as "fuck" or "cunt" or "I never loved you, signed, Daddy" or "I'm coming to murder you and your family."
* He hates being disagreed with, as anything that does not completely agree with his world view is evil.
* <s>All insults, swear words, or</s> atheist opinions, comments, and arguments. Because they are the work of [[Satan]] himself, and are therefore awesome and play [[black metal|Satanic cunt death metal]] shred guitar.
* He hates [[Free Speech|the very things that make our society good]], as society is pointless, because life is only for getting into heaven.
Therefore, like all the other Creatard Fuckwits on Youtube, he...
* Disables Voting on his videos (right after using socks to bump them up).
* He blocks commenters with reckless, lustful abandon.
* His comments are set to approval only.
* ...and then he deletes any comments that don't lavishly tongue his asshole.
* Video responses are approval only.

His videos can be seen and commented on at the mirror channel [http://www.youtube.com/VenomFagnX here.]

VenomFangX also censors his website, because he is in fact not interested in even debating, let alone converting [[Atheism|atheists]], but rather getting his ego massaged and his [[cock]] sucked by his creationist [[Monica Lewinsky|fuck buddies]].

==Shawn and employment==
Shawn, being a [[douchebag]] has now been fired three times already for harassing customers with his beliefs. In this video presented below, he talks about how he got fired for "spreading the gospel" and playing ''Expelled'' in the video store he worked in. Of course, he barely mentions how he was using the video store's DVD burners to produce [[over 9,000]] DVDs containing about 17 hours of Kent Hovind lectures that he would then give out to people visiting the video store.  

Of course, the lazy little bum has now resorted to E-begging, so he can indulge further with his egotistical agenda and make money out of the suckers that support him.

<center>"How I lost my job and expect my sycophants to give me money"<br>

<youtube>PZY-S2oMywU</youtube><br>

</center>

YouTube user lordhathor [[http://www.youtube.com/user/lordhathor]] unleashed [[Epic|''unrecoverable'']] pwnage upon VenomFangX when he posted a video which contained a telephone interview of a minister whose church had actually offered Shawn a job. According to the minister, Shawn turned the job down because he was making [[Greedy|more Jew Gikd]] from his Paypal donation scam than the church had offered him as a [[Poverty|salary]]. Furthermore, Shawn doesn't like other people telling him what to do and since [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|he doesn't want to take orders]] even from a church, he [[GTFO|turned them down]].<BR>
Shawn's inability to follow orders might be a problem for him if it turns out that there is a God and a Heaven. Especially if that God demands utter, unswerving obedience from his "sheep."

When Shawn had his channel, he posted [[Fanfiction|videos]] of himself witnessing to students on the college campus. They would [[Liar|claim]] to be atheists and would be led to [[Jebus]] by the [[Troll|tireless efforts]] of Venomfangx. Unfortunately for Shawn, the minister spoke to some of the people Shawn had supposedly "led to Christ" and it turned-out that they were already Christians and had been for years. So, they were being [[Bullshit|less than truthful]] when they said on-tape that they were not.<BR>
Yet again, proof that finding Jebus does not make the Ninth Commandment easier to obey.

==On-line DRAMA==

===Temporary Suspension===
Sometime in March 2008, VenomFangX was suspended by the YouTube Anti-Lulz Squad, along with a load of [[shit_nobody_cares about|other anti-Islam people]]. The general consensus was that [[Muslims]] flagged the shit out of his videos, although it might have been because he posted [[gore]] in a video. Some people loled at the sweet irony of a censor-mongering idiot getting censored himself, but a large number of [[moralfags]] started talking about [[boring|how everyone deserves freedom of speech]] and stuff. He was promptly reinstated, and thanks to all the atheists helping him return, he realized the error of his ways and decided to allow free speech on his channel.<BR>
LOL no, just joking, he went right back to calling atheist amoral scumwaffles and ''still'' doesn't allow any comments that aren't kissing his ass.

===The Thunderf00t/[[DMCA]] Debacle===
[[Image:VenomFangX_by_Glorfon.jpg‎|right|thumb|Why so full of [[FAIL]]?]]
Late Summer, early Autumn, 2008 - Venomfangx, unable to intelligently refute the verbal ass-raping handed to him by [[thunderf00t]] in his "''Why Do People Laugh at Creationists?''" series, resorts to claiming that his intellectual properties were stolen; and under supposed advice from a [[friend]], filed [[DMCA]] charges against [[thunderf00t]] for using his beastly, Patrick Bateman-esque image without permission. Several of [[thunderf00t]]'s videos were promptly removed.

Of course, any idiot with half a brain in their skull would realize that any original user video submitted to YouTube automatically forfeits any and all intellectual rights and copyrights.

This, of course, didn't stop Shawn. When questioned by [[thunderf00t]] about the removal of his content, PCS blatantly lied about filing a [[DMCA]] against thunderf00t, claiming that his "friend" mistakenly filed it for him... that is until said "friend", and noted [[Christfag]], togetherforpeace, revealed that he had nothing to do with the DMCA claim against thunderf00t; and even advised VFX against this, and other potential DMCA claims. PCS quickly countered by calling his friend a "backstabber" for having an faint ember of a conscience. 

Meanwhile, thunderf00t accumulated legal support, and mounted a (much more) valid claim against PCS for wrongly filing a DMCA charge. Togetherforpeace's testimony in mind, thunderf00t laid out the potential consequences to King Faggot, PCS for filing a false DMCA. VenomFangX responded with what is widely regarded the most faggoty and Psychotic video ever recorded; The Joker Video.

<center><TT><FONT COLOR="RED">'''''THE INFAMOUS VenomfangX "<U>JOKER VIDEO</U>"'''''</FONT></TT></center>

{{ytplus|Why So Schizophenic!?|<youtube>E1XgKQxasxg</youtube>|"Mwahahahahahahahaaa!!!"|-- VFX, sensible and rational debater, while posing as a psychotic comic book supervillain.}}

Shortly after dressing up as DC Comic's [[why so serious?| Ace Of Knaves]] and accusing his intellectually superior opponent of blackmail, VFX was served notice that charges were going to be pressed against him by thunderf00t for his hastily filed and wholly unfounded [[DMCA]] claim.<BR>
As such, Thunderf00t gave him until September 22nd to [[gtfo]]. It more or less went like this:

===VenomFangX vs Thunderf00t, The Legal Smackdown===
<TT>
'''VFX:'''  Hey! These videos that are criticizing ''me'' use clips from ''my'' videos.  That means I can file a metric shit-ton of [[DMCA]]s and get them taken down.

'''Thunderf00t:'''  Actually clips used for satire and criticism are covered by 'fair use.'  Also, did you know that you could be charged with perjury for filing false [[DMCA]]s?

'''VFX:'''  Um..... [[Lie|A "friend" of mine filed some DMCAs by mistake.]] [[Bullshit|You see there was this big list of DMCAs and two of your videos ''accidentally'' got put on there.]] I'm so very sorry about this, old chum. I'll be the first to admit that as a filthy sin-ridden human, I'm fallible and sometimes make mistakes. Can we be friends now?

'''Thunderf00t:''' No. Leave YouTube for a year or I'll pursue perjury charges.

'''VFX:''' YOU CAN'T USE CLIPS OF MY VIDEOS! I made them, I own the copyright on them. My [[DMCA]]s were totally justified! This is censorship!

'''Thunderf00t:''' Nvm this shit, I'll let you off the hook. I don't want to have your account deleted 'cause [[Why So Serious?| you're just too much fun.]] But you have to tell everyone you're a [['tard]] and a [[liar]]. Your own antics debunk your ideology way better than my vids do.

'''VFX:''' Ok [[Sorry|sry]], my bad. [[Kthxbai]].</TT>

<center> '''and then...'''  </center>
Realizing that his tangent of [[faggotry]] and scare tactics had failed and that thunderf00t was still prepared to thoroughly rape his pasty ass, PCS was forced to recite a half-assed apology to all of the [[internets]] which was written by someone obviously not him, as the language was sensible, intelligent, well thought out, clearly expressed and most of all...''true''.
<center><youtube>T_MYyc-PtH4</youtube></center>
Note the glassy, zombie-like stare; the absence of affect or passion. The feeling of telling the truth must be so alien to him that he doesn't know to express it convincingly.<BR>
Amusing side fact: This is thunderf00t's edited down version...VFX's original was 4 minutes of drab apology followed by 5 1/2 minutes of VFX trying to coax you into visiting he new website and (hint hint) donating to the attached PayPal account. Balls of brass, ladies and gentlemen. Balls of solid fucking brass.


===VenomFangX Promotes Murder===
[[Last Thursday|On April 10, 2009]], VenomFangX's biggest fan, Anthony Powell ([[Tony48219]] on YouTube), committed a [[Chris Benoit|murder-suicide]], tragically and VenomFangPleasingly killing himself and the innocent [[atheism|atheist]] Asia McGowan in the process, though not necessarily in that order. Some smart sleuths recalled that Tony was a huge fan of Shawn's videos, hating atheists as much and even more than his hero. It is clear from Tony's videos, where he insults atheists with creative terms such as "titty fucking," that he completely agreed with and got all his values from VenomFangX's videos. Therefore, these sleuths figured out that Shawn was solely responsible for the deaths of Anthony Powell and Asia McGowen. Of course, to make himself look innocent, he made a video completely denying that he knew and/or brainwashed Tony, and instead audaciously pinned the blame for Tony's actions on Tony.

<center>He even fakes losing his composure at the beginning of the video to garner sympathy.</center>
<center><youtube>GRaoJ2ctoj0</youtube></center>

<center>Surprisingly, neither Tony nor Shawn were charged for the deaths, but now under heavy suspicion, Shawn will certainly not be able to get away with another stunt like this.</center>

===Website and Paypal Scam===
VenomfangX started his own [http://www.venomfangxsite.com/ website], so he could have all his [[fantards]] play with him. He even claimed that all would be welcomed. Of course within a few days, he censored people for just being smarter than him. It has forums and a chatroom that can be trolled for the lulz. 

He also lied again about Thunderf00t, since he claimed that Thunderf00t had joined his site, of course Thunderf00t posted in his channel and revealed that it was an impostor and that [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Thunderf00t&view=comments he in fact didn't sign up];

=== [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|Shut Down]] ===
On May 6th, 2009, VenomFangX's website and YouTube account were [[EPIC WIN|shut down]] after he was [[pwnd|busted by Canadian authorities]] after it was discovered that he used Paypal donations from his subscribers (which he claimed were to go to Sick Kids Hospital) to buy a new car and pay for college tuition.

Being the pussy he is however, after shutting the site down, VenomFagX lied in a vid trying to cover his scam up, claiming that [[Obama|Muslim terrorists]] threatened his parents' lives and he shut it down with their permission, hoping not to [[offended?|offend]] anyone.

<center><youtube>a2Ar2IWILmU</youtube></center> 
<center>'''and here, someone explains to VFX's dad why he fucked up</center>

<s>''Surprise, VenomFagX's [http://www.youtube.com/user/venomfangx account] is back up again!''</s> Ooops it goes bye bye.

[[Image:Closed YouTube Account.png|frame|center]]

Apparently, the confounded Mohammedans are at it again:
<center><youtube>kFM7mXNxKpc</youtube></center>

=== [[GEERUP]]: The "new" VenomFangX ===

Shawn originally left Youtube <s>(but has now returned)</s> but temporarily reclaimed it after his scam site was closed down.<BR>
In his "final" video (how many have there been now?) he states that he was forced to leave Youtube because of all the [[lie|death threats he's received]] from the filthy, filthy sand negros. He then announces the name of the Youtuber he is [[A Game of Pretend|passing the torch]] to: GEERUP.<BR>
GEERUP is a [[pedophile|40 year old man]] with whom Shawn has repeatedly preformed [[blowjob|fellatio]] on, among [[Pain Series|many other things]]. He, too, is a [[cunt|cuntbag creationist]] that spews non-stop [[bullshit]]. Although it's hard to believe, PCS found the one creatard dumber than himself. Some comparisons:

*VenomFangX fakes a big vocabulary. [[ALL CAPS|GEERUP TYPES IN CAPS]].
*VenomFangX is a [[twink]]. GEERUP is a [[pedophile]].
*VenomFangX is a dork. GEERUP is a redneck.
*VenomFangX receives death threats. GEERUP writes death threats.
*VenomFangX uses God like a weapon. GEERUP uses God as fapping material.
*VenomFangX is a [[douche]]. GEERUP is a [[cunt]]. 

Most of GEERUP's short, sad tenure was taken up with failing to understand taxonomy, even after this scary Klingon from Texas (http://www.youtube.com/user/AronRa) explained it to him, like, 5 times.
The hilarity will continue on the normal [http://www.youtube.com/user/VenomFangX VenomFangX channel], so stay tuned for [[lulz]].

===Wait, nevermind===

Venomfangx is showing his attention-whorish colors again. After the prominent [[Youtube]] scientist, Thunderf00t, had a debate with Christian [[retard|fuckwit]] Ray Cumfart, Shawn decided to make a video response. Apparently, Shawn is [[butthurt]] that Thunderf00t got to meet Comfort before he did. The video displays everything that's hated about Shawn; his unfounded certainty, his disgusting [[twilight|pale face]], his utter lack of understanding in science, his [[rage]]-inducing arrogance and the fact that he also attacks Thunderf00t's stutter, showing how [[fucktarded|classy]] he is. Also take note that Shawn can barely go a full minute without comparing Thunderf00t to [[Godwin|Hitler]].<BR>
In the description, it says "[[bullshit|No, I'm not back for good]]", meaning this drama-queen will [[Brb|be back]] in about a week to make another farewell video.

<center><youtube>Ue2_URd7G9o</youtube></center>

<s>JK GUISE, VenomFangX BALEETED HIZ ACCOUNTZ</s>. The video have been mirrored by other users, so we all can see how to quote-mine and also steal techniques from the person you are arguing against (Thunderf00t once suggested that PCS should delete all his videos for the benefit of mankind). EPIC FAIL, Shawn Karon!

===The Vengeance is Delicious, You Must Taste It===

Apparently, Daddy Venomfang doesn't know that Baby Venomfang is sneaking around behind his back and making [[drama]] again. Feel free to call Mr. Karon at 905-731-8992 and congratulate him and his son on defeating the Muslims who were threatening them, and say that it's great that Shawn is back on Youtube making videos again. Or you can send him a (tasteful, Christian-friendly) greeting card at the following address: 19 Circle Court, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada, L3T 7X2. http://tinyurl.com/y8smroc

===Abusing Teh [[DMCA]] on Youtube AGAIN!===

In January 2010, shortly after yet another "triumphant" return, in a display of almost incomprehensible fail Venomfangx filed more than 30  false DMCA's, five of which were against the Youtube user Dprjones, for ''"[using] my image without permission"'' and attempts to ''"incite hatred against me and endanger my family''" and "''[[Shit nobody cares about|Making Baby Jesus Cry]]''".<BR>
Unbeknownst to Venomfangx, dprjones is actually a real lawyer (instead of just an [[E-lawyer|wannabe e-Lawyer]]) who provided legal advice to Thunderf00t the first time [[unwarranted self importance|PCS]] tried this shit; and in sending the PM to Dprjones provided irrefutable evidence of his crime. We can only hope PCS is delivered a [[pwn|titanic legal smack-down]] for his hubris, with any luck he might get some [[Ass rape|quality time]] with his idol Kent Hovind at the local penitentiary.<BR>
 
<center><youtube>sSXlGYs0yxw</youtube></center> 
<center>'''VenomfangX gets DMCA Happy...Again!'''</center>

In response to Venom's fraudulent [[DMCA]]s and other illegal activities, dprjones has sent a notice that because of his irresponsible behaviour, he has ten days to terminate his account and leave Youtube for one year, or he will contact Youtube and pursue [[pwned|legal action]]. And unlike Thunderf00t he will not [[for the lulz|accept an apology]].<BR>

<center><youtube>2-7I3sdzFVQ</youtube></center> 
<center>'''DPR'sjones Debunking (and Ultimatum!) to VenomfangX!'''</center>

And did PCS realize that he was outmatched by someone who knew what the fuck he was talking about? Did PCS come to his senses and quietly sneak out the side door so as to avoid any further humiliation? FUCK. NO! He went all [[Internet Tough Guy]] and challenged a lawyer to a [[Internet lawsuit|LolSuit]]!!<BR>

<center><youtube>7c0ni7xLhbo</youtube></center> 
<center>'''Venom playing the [[Victim]] card against the "Evil Atheists"(As usual).'''</center>

His initial response (not as [[batshit insane]] as his DMCA [[wtf|response]] to Thunderf00t while dressed as the Joker, but still completely and utterly ignorant, especially since he clearly did not learn from his previous stupidity).

<center><youtube>HKJyjVa3Khw</youtube></center> 
<center>'''VFX KNUCKLES UNDER!'''</center>

And as expected, five minutes after acknowledging his grave mistake... He posted an [[bullshit|apology]].<BR>
Yep. Only hours after making his "imma gonna fuck you up, dpr" video....he tries to weasel his way out of the oncoming train of legal assrape headin' his way, by posting a half-hearted, bullshit [[lies|psuedo-apology]], as if that will help in the slightest. [[HA_HA_HA,_OH_WOW|Ha Ha, Oh Wow]]!!!

<b>The tl;dw version of the above vids...</b>

===VenomFangX vs dprjones, or ROUND 2: Electric Boogaloo===
<TT>
'''VFX''': Hey! These videos that are criticizing me use clips from my videos. That means I can file a metric shit-ton of DMCAs and get them taken down.

'''dprjones''': Actually clips used for satire and criticism are covered by 'fair use.' Also, did you know that you could be charged with perjury for filing false [[DMCA]]s?

'''VFX''': Um..... can't you just take down your own vids and let me keep making vids saying all atheists are babyrapists and are having buttsecks with Charles Darwin's corpse and pissing in his open mouth?

'''dprjones''': No. Leave YouTube in 10 days or I'll pursue perjury charges.

'''VFX''': YOU CAN'T USE CLIPS OF MY VIDEOS! I made them, I own the copyright on them. My [[DMCA]]s were totally justified! This is censorship!

'''dprjones''': ''(ignores VFX and begins writing his opening statement for the upcoming court case.)''

====It's on like [[Donkey Kong]]====

Despite leaving and never coming back, VenomFangX then started uploading a video using his [[over 9000]] sock accounts (here's 6 of them: aTHEISTnotanAtheist, snow364, AtheismisDumb, FrDtttal, gbcgy818, Godslight123) alleging that dprjones asked a 17 year old girl to show her breasts to him on camera, and as such is a [[pedophile]]. In true VenomFangX fashion, he didn't do the research.<BR>
The woman involved was actually in her 20's and thus no crime was committed. As of 4:00pm he was still reposting/re-featuring the vid on other sock-accounts and trying to get his followers to follow suit. As for the sock accounts...wouldn't it be a shame and a pity if those accounts were flagged, spammed, votebotted and DMCA'd into a hole in the ground? Not making a suggestion, just making the observation that it would be a shame. Yeah.<BR>
Meanwhile as dprjones sleeps (britain is far away mmmkay) Over9000 commenters to his videos are begging him to totally sue the ever loving shit out of VenomFagX to teach him a lesson. We await his decision.

<center><B>'''''Wow. He not only goes out like a punk with his tail between his legs, he manages to incriminate himself again!'''''</B></center>

In this vid VFX shows he can't pronounce the word malevolent "<TT>MA-LEV-O-LENT</TT>" (this becomes important later, trust me.) and claims he ''chooses'' to leave YouTube so he can focus on his [[Cum|Semin]]ary College [[A Game of Pretend|Schoolwork]], and then hurls out a libellous accusation that dprjones is a [[pedophile|kiddyfiddler]] because he wanted to see a 25-year old womans [[tits|bewbz]].  Yeah, venom, false libel accusations, that'll make you look good to a jury. Suuuuuure.

'''
As techniques go to goad people in to [[Internet troll personality disorder|filing lawsuits against oneself]], all agree VenomFangX's new fighting style is unstoppable.

===Venom says goodbye ([[Brb|again]])===
[[Image:Internet_Argument_Technique_-6_-_Hotel_California_Guest.jpg‎]]
8 January 2010

Apparenty VenomFagX came to his sense before entering a legal battle which the poor little fucker knows he can't win. In true [[butthurt]] pussy fashion, he deleted all his videos and uploaded a video saying goodbye to all his drooling, sexless fanbois - lying yet again that he was leaving because [[Lies|atheists....or....muslims....or space aliens....had threatened the safety of his parents]], ([[Shit_no_one_cares_about|claiming that now the evil atheists cannot be saved because they tried to censor him from sharing the Gospel]]).<BR>
Unfortunately he likely has garnered so many mindless sheep from his ex-Youtube ministry, that he'll be able to start his own pedophile cult (in Waco fashion). If we're lucky, hopefully him and his peons will [[an hero|end up like Jim Jones.]]<BR>

<center><youtube>CNFZxsoJirI</youtube></center> 

<CENTER><b>But don't worry, [[terminator|he'll be back]], as he [[Chronic Troll Syndrome|can't seem to avoid personally embarrassing himself in every opportunity he gets]].</b></CENTER>

As usual, he'll spend a year seriously contemplating his mistakes, praying for forgiveness, and being a good Christian.<BR> 
Naw, I'm just shitting you. He'll probably just beg for money from gullible [[creationists|creationtards]] and blame the evil atheists and muslims for his own mistakes and everything that ever went wrong in his life, from his parent's disappointment to his poorly-shaven unibrow to his failure to achieve an erection.

===The shitfest continues===
11 January 2010

It's like a three-year-old having a temper tantrum. He can't play in the sandbox anymore because he's pissed and shit in it too many times, so he wants to destroy all the other sandcastles so he can feel better about himself as a last ditch effort. 

Despite the closure of his channel, he kept on flagging dprjones' videos, resulting in the suspension of dpr's both main and sub accounts:
<center><youtube>tr2g2pbbfCM</youtube></center>
Other victims include:
djarm67 (4 DMCA's filed),<br />
Jesuzfreek777 (Was suspended.)<br />
Thunderf00t (Limited info.).<br />
C0ct0pusPrime (Again, limited info.),<br />

TOMMYfromtheBRONX (Has video up).<br />
Tylzen<br>

<center><youtube>7f6JRjb3Ur0</youtube></center>

A new video has appeared on the Internet, from a user called "jordanowen42", in which he reports on the correspondence he had been having with VenomFangX's father Hilton (see "Criticism: Daddy" below).

Too bad VFX is too daft to realize that -- in the almost certain likelihood he will return to YouTube -- he won't be able to pull the shame shit he always has. Because of his [[butthurt]] immaturity, as well as countless protests for change from a number of popular bloggers, YouTube might actually start making some real changes to its [[DMCA]] filing procedure, thus rendering it unable to be abused the way he intended.  [[game over|GAME OVER]], (Shawn), [[game over|YEAHHHH!]].

=== Response to Removed Youtube Account ===
First he makes a video promising never to accept any money. Then he makes a video asking for donations.<br>
You'd think maybe after somebody made a video pointing out this discrepancy that he would maybe shut the fuck up.<br>
But no. Even after his account has been destroyed he still attempts to get money ( to help "Christianity").
<br>
This is the email:<br><br>

===VenomFangX's Sockpuppets vs GodJesus, or ROUND 4: The Fucktard Menace===
(note, he came back on December 20th 2010...he hasn't had time to do anything stupid, yet....but he will. And this section here will be waiting for him.)

==Criticism==

Due to the amount of [[moron|sheer stupidity]] of Venomfangx, he has earned many critics from both [[Atheism|Atheists]] and even his fellow Christians, who call him out on his magnitude of [[fail]]

===From Atheists===

Most criticism from [[Atheist|Atheists]] is divided. It is divided in two regularly occurring arguments concerning this waste of space.

Is it the fact he's a combination of a spoiled brat, a [[douchebag]], a clueless git, with the morals and ethics of a hyena with a less tolerable laugh? Nothing more but a miserable [[twink]] with a﻿ narcissistic streak that would embarrass a pro-wrestler?

Or is it because he is the end product of a movement dedicated to celebrating the annoyance of the general public with their self-loathing and utter denial of, at the very least, about [[over 9000| 400]] years of scientific discovery and social evolution? 

It could very well be one of life's greater mysteries.

===Even others Christians want to throw him to the Wolves.===
How much of a filthy snake do you have to be when even other Christards want you spanked with a chainsaw? 

Apparently, there is a limit to even what fellow [[Christfags]] will take. for example, Togetherforpeace, a former co-conspirator couldn't take his [[ego]] anymore and spilled the beans, thus showing that even in a pile of shit, there is potential for growth.

Here is a small (but growing) list of Christfags who are getting pissed off over PCS.

'''''VIDEO LIST:'''''

1- '''Togetherforpeace''' -- Reveals his email conversation with Venom the [[liar]].<br>
2- '''jezuzfreek777''' -- Admits he was wrong when he supported Venom against Thunderf00t.<br>
3- '''jezuzfreek777''' -- Tells Venom off for not heeding his elder Christians' advices. Holy frogshit, even JezuzFreek777 won't stick up for him anymore?! This is saying much!! Considering they are birds of the same feather.<br>
4- '''stonedcommander''' -- When even your Creationist fella thinks you're a douche-nozzle, you must be [[doing it wrong]].<br>
5- '''UNFFWildcard''' -- VenomfangX: Liar and Charlatan, part 1<br>
6- '''UNFFWildcard''' -- VenomfangX: Liar and Charlatan, part 2<br>
7- '''UNFFWildcard''' -- VenomfangX: Liar and Charlatan, part 3<br>

Venom's [[Serious business|real]] father [[List of ways to win at the internet|admits]] Venom is "naive and brainwashed by Kent Hovind":
<center><youtube>CF5WGV92VV0</youtube></center><BR>
and to get revenge on Jordan Owen for airing VFX's dirty laundry, VFX (or his minions) have been votebotting Jordan's YouTube account into a hole in the ground. Because, hey, when you can't win by refuting an argument, you can just resort to cyber-raep.

An [[ED]] article can only hold so many [[lulz]] before it starts to become an archival collection of [[fail|failures]], and Shawn is a perfect example of this. He deserves all the criticism he has been given, though one can imagine an entire [[YouTube]] community of people who dislike you and an entire ED article with [[over 9000|many]] examples of fail might possibly make you want to change for the better and go see a [[A_frank_discussion_of_mental_illness|shrink]]. Let's hope he actually learned his lesson and isn't just pretending, because we and everyone else are tired of his lies. [[nevar forget|We never forget]], but we might no longer feel the need to write about him if he becomes a person of less notable [[fail]] and stops making an example of himself to everyone.
Needless to say, Lord Hathor just doesn't give a fuck!

==The Apology v4.0==
Coming Soon to an embarrassed universe near you!

==Where is VenomFangX now?==
Nowadays, the exact same shit he did before he got kicked off YouTube....making the same YouTube videos yet again, continuing to trot out and rehash the same tired, already debunked Kent Hovind arguments, again, for the 9001st time. 
If you would like to meet him in person for a cup of <s>semen</s>coffee or just to say hi, then please, do not hesitate to find him at the Non-accredited/Christian/Evilution school:

Tyndale College and Seminary (In reality, a preacher farm. Just what the world DOESN'T need).

North York Toronto CA

http://www.tyndale.ca/about/location

and '''''what''''' is he doing at that school, you ask? Well, here's some exclusive, never before seen footage. In this vid, Venomfang gets pegged by a black hooker while he fellates a dong-shaped crackpipe...

At ~5:30, the vocoder momentarily fails, and for ~1 second, you can hear "Shawn"'s unaltered voice.

Wasn't the deal with dprJones that he stay away until at least, January 19th of 2011?
Did his folks finally kick him out and is he broadcasting his Kent Hovind-wannabe nonsense from the basement of the local YMCA? We might never know.

'''UPDATE May 27th 2010'''....Lunchtime!<br>
The original vids on the BibleBarney channel have been removed due....due to [[DMCA]] notices from Hit Entertainment, the owners of Barney the Purple Dinosaur.<br>
So VFX's ''Triumphant Return'' has been mometarily thwarted!<br>
'''UPDATE May 28th 2010'''....12am<br>
Even though his original channel was hit by DMCA's, He just won't stay down. He's opened another channel: BarneyBibleShow ...and re-posted the video.

===CAVEAT===

You will make note that to do so is [[IRL trolling]] and you lack the protection that you would gain [[OTI]]. Proceed at your own risk.
Not that being online help you. If you counter-notify any of his DMCA's he'll happily drop you docs to anyone who emails him.<br>
[[image:VFX_Drops_DOCS_to_anyone_who_emails_him!.jpg]]

==Alleged death threats made against him==

On numerous occasions PCS has mentioned that there were death threats made against him by Muslims extremists and/or other unmentioned individuals. While many of his fellow Christfags gobbled it up, it was rather unusual that there were no mentioning of it on local news, be it tv stations, radio station or even newspapers, it leaves us to wonder if they were true at all and not an excuse [[coward|to exit stage left]]

FUN THINGS TO KEEP THE KIDS AMUSED II: Here's something [[retard|"''special''"]] Shawn put in the "About Me" section of the Profile for his [[Sockpuppet]] "IslamIsaCancer":<br>

==His words of wisdom==

{{squote|I was schooled by God himself. Impressive?}}

{{squote|I think that the Bible is the most scientifically accurate book in the entire world}}

{{squote|You see, this is an awfully thick book to talk about something that you say doesnt exist!|Shawn on the Bible. By that logic, ''Lord of the Rings'' has more value as a historical document than ''The Gulag Archipelago''}}

{{squote|Where in the Bible does it say God will heal amputees?... God never said he would and he doesnt. That alligns perfectly with my definition of God. Why SHOULD God heal amputees, he's the one who allowed you to lose your arm in the first place! Does God have a moral obligation to heal someone who has sinned against him? Absoloutely not... <B>So, why doesnt God heal amputees? Because they don't deserve their arms, we deserve to die, thats what the Bible teaches</B>. Sorry if you don't like that!}}

{{squote|I eat bread and drink wine in order to remember starving people in the world. That aligns perfectly with my definition of Christian, so Mom and Dad and I would get together and eat ten different herbs, and eggs, and bitter herbs, and stuff like that as a remembrance of starving people. Through feasts, we remember certain things, and by eating bread, we remember the act of chewing, the breaking, and <B>I don't have a moral obligation to feed all the fallen, sinful people. Absolutely not. You don't deserve squat, and now we expect me to... to do things for us? I mean, where does it end, right? You don't deserve squat!</B>}}

{{squote|We read in Deuteronomy 28, a book written by Moses, a curse that was promised to the Israelites if they rejected their God... It talks about how Israel will be scattered to the ends of the world and how they will be few in number and their enemies would destroy them if they rejected their God. Now, if we look at recent tragedies, and they are tragedies, like the Holocaust, we can't say that was God's blessing on Israel, that was clearly not a blessing, so it seems to me that Israel has rejected their Messiah... <B>The promises of the curse of Israel if they rejected their God have come true. Deuteronomy 28 has come true.</B>}}

{{squote|I mean really, when I get a shot for hepatitis and become inoculated, that obviously means... <B>I'm a space mutant</B>! And I'm evolving! I mean duh... Why didn't I think of that?!}}

{{squote|'''VFX:''' i won't debate hebrew with you, i'll debate the english tho, and the english makes it dead clear, day 4 the stars and sun were created.<br>
'''Kabane52:''' Friend. God wrote his scriptures in the original Hebrew.<br>
'''VFX:''' yes, but I don't know hebrew, and <B>I trust God ordained translated to convey to me the message I need</B>}}
