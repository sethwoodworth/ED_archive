{{quote|I just came back from a meeting with the Dean. I am apparently forbidden from setting foot on campus for 4 days pending a meeting with the dean of education. How did this happen?|Bob Averill on being a sanctimonious jackass}}

{{quote|On Monday morning, November 20, Averill met with the school's president, Dr. Steven Goldman, to appeal his dismissal. "He upheld the dean's decision to throw me out," Averill says. "He offered to re-admit me if I underwent—get this—psychiatric evaluation."|Bob is a fucking psycho}}

After spending all his time yelling at freshmen for believing in leprechauns (instead of studying), Averill was ejected from liberal art college and [http://forums.penny-arcade.com/showthread.php?t=7936 cried] on the [[Penny Arcade|Penny Arcade forums]] about it. After being rejected by a forum full of furries and otakus, he turns to mspaint threads in GBS for the attention he craves.

== Pedophile ==

{{quote|My girlfriend of four months is fifteen. For reference, I am twenty two.

Am I a pedophile? Of course not. That's a word misused by most people to mean "anyone under the age of consent". The truth is that since she's over 13 she's a teenager, and every heterosexual American man loves teenage girls.|}}

Bob Averill is a pedophile. After asking SomethingAwful where the lowest age of consent is, he packed up his girlfriend and headed to vegas for a week of "genuinely respecting her for her intellect."

Of course, they had sex.

{{quote|So fast forward to last week: She starts sending me emails telling me how great the sex was with me, how huge my dick is and how she still thinks about me. I have kind of a fragile ego as it is so naturally I lit up like the sun when I read these. She always used to tell me I was the best she'd ever had and here it was in writing. I wanted to frame it and hang it next to my degree, directing the attention of potential clients to it, "should they have any doubts as to the virility of my mighty Jango Fett".|}}
