The '''RIAA''' is an [[Unwarranted self-importance|extremely important and vital organization]] created [[at least 100 years ago]]. The sole purpose of the RIAA (referred to in court as the '''[[Rape]] by Instant Anal Assault''') is to jack up CD prices and sue people who own music in any form. They played an integral role in the downfall of [[Napster]], and are currently destroying [[P2P|KaZaA]] for everyone. Thankfully, they haven't yet gotten their grubby hands on [[Bram Cohen]].  The RIAA's President is a [[fat]] Jew [[dyke]] who gives rimjobs to record label presidents who recently [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/hilary-rosen/the-supreme-wisdom-of-not_3221.html apologized for being so mean and unfunny to everybody]. 

The RIAA loves to sue kids and old people who download "Happy Birthday" and other public domain Holiday songs because apparently [[Metallica]] and Mexican aren't gonna get their diamond-encrusted Rolls-Royces unless Granny pays dearly for her crimes. However, according to [[Ed Lolington | David Souter]], it is okay to use Grokster as long as you are looking for a free Decameron, not the latest single from Modest Mouse.

The RIAA spends most of its time in law courts destroying [[Napster]] and [[P2P|Grokster]].  So, if you are a software company with "-ster" at the end of its name, change your brand name soon!

The RIAA utterly destroys [[over_9000|over 9,000]] people's lives every year by firing massive lawsuits that bankrupt them. Often people caught burning music onto blank CD's are sent to prison between 50 and 100 years and fined millions of dollars all for the minor moral wrongdoing of copying a music CD. The RIAA makes at least $150,000,000,000 per year. And the CEOs of these corporations pocket a somewhat large percentage of that money. They're angry that they can't finance $900,000 Mercedes, or buy 80 million dollar homes. They are losing a small percentage of their profits to online pirates. Of course, they want to continue their luxurious lifestyles, but in order to do that, they have to needlessly destroy thousands of people's lives, and send them to [[prison|Bubba]] for [[at least 100|dozens]] of years. When it comes to corporate greed, no corporation more classically defines it than the RIAA...but it's only human nature!

== Grandmothers and Lawsuits ==

The RIAA has a severe dislike of [[lemonparty|old people]], particularly those of [[female]] persuasion. After the aforementioned [[old]] person's grandson downloaded a fuck all amount of songs off a "-ster" site, they did not go after the site (That would occur later in what would become World War 2.0), they didn't even go after the thieving little bastard, they instead [[Rape|went after]] the grandmother.

They sued her for every penny she had, totally raping her retirement plan, and crushing what spirit she had left. [[Feminazi]]s everywhere went [[batshit crazy]], the AARP collectively suffered a stroke, and [[lawyer]]s everywhere shook their heads (while secretly lining their pockets from the lawsuits).

The RIAA recently published a new article warning [[pregnant]] women of possible birth defects due to listening to pirated [[heavy metal|death metal]]. It went on to mention that syphilis and [[AIDS]] are both caused by the continued [[pirate|piracy]] and circulation of copyrighted music. A [[piratekiller]] has been preemptively deployed to punish those pirates who are responsible for this suffering.

Interestingly enough, one of the joys of living in [[Canada|Canada]] (aside from the free health care which includes free surgeries that would cost $1,000,000,000 USD and the pain meds that are epic win) is that the MPAA and RIAA have no legal clout. Canada levies a tax on all recordable media like CD-R's, cassettes and VHS tapes that is paid as hush money to the RIAA and MPAA. This allows Canadians to download, archive and share MP3's and AVI movies freely and burn "archival copies in the format of their choice" at will. When the RIAA attempted to bend Canadians over the desk and [[anal|ass rape]] them for intellectual property theft, Canadians as a whole laughed in their faces and pointed to the taxation and copyright laws that state that a Canadian can download, share and fuck the RIAA up the ass at will because they are given money to shut the fuck up. In short, Canada [[13 year old boy|pwns]] the asses of the MPAA and RIAA. This is the only known reason to live in the frozen wasteland of fail called Canada.  Too bad [[lolicon|loli]] is illegal.

It might also have something to do with the fact that they are THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY WITH THEIR OWN SEPARATE LEGAL SYSTEM.

{{squote|"It is a link to a lot of other crimes, and I tell the prosecutors and the police officers that I work with all the time. 'Use this type of crime as a tool. This might lead you to a drug investigaion. It might allow you to have a probable cause for a drug house. You couldn't get in before, but now you can get in by purchasing, doing undercover purchases of CDs.' It also has links to some terrorist organisations for thoses federal prosecutors out there, as number of cases they're working on right now, but what we were saying is also a link to selling drugs with the CDs."|Deborah Robinson - Regional Counsel, Anti-Piracy Div., RIAA}}

Do you know anyone who owns blank CD's? They may be a terrorist! Watch this informative video and report any suspicious behavior to your local law enforcement.
