Death of a Meme
<center>[[Image:Nedmsoviet.gif]]</center><br>
The '''death of a meme''' is the inevitable end of both forced and unforced [[memes]] and WILL happen in many ways, depending on the type of meme and what site it showed its ugly face at first. A dead meme is unique as it is usually the only one instant of [[lulz]] ever sparked by the former meme. So, remember that the next time you see a meme [[win|get popular]], [[fail|ruin the web]], or [[OH SHI-|cause all-around chaos]], you [[truth|should stand the fuck away]] or you're going to go down with it.

==How Does Meme Die?==
After a meme is confirmed to be true lulz, it will spread to thousands of sites, until the lulz that started it becomes its [[Burger King|worst nightmare]] by converting to an unchangeable type of matter on the interwebs called [[anti-lulz]]. This is not always the case, although it is the most common way for a meme to die. 

Another way a meme can die is if the meme in question is completely erased by the administration of the site that spawned said meme or from one part of the site until there is nothing resembling the original meme left. Most would consider this to be a good thing, but this actually makes the situation worse, as there is always a copy of the soon-to-die meme on some troll's computer, waiting to be unleashed again.

All dead memes report to [[YTMND|YTMND]].

In the most accurate sense, a meme dies the very second it becomes a meme. But some memes are deader than dead. Prime examples of dead(er) memes are listed below.

*[[Dancing Owen]]
*[[Dial Soap]]
*[[EPIN]]
*[[Girugamesh]]
*[[NEDM]]
*[[Peter]]
*[[Rick Roll]]
