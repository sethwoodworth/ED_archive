'''Are you serious?''' is a [[viral]] vidya that is currently the drama du jour on [[YouTube]] and [[boner|trending hard]] on the likes of [[Twitter]][[Facebook|Book]]. The drama centers around a [[Awesome|brave]] [[Cop|police officer]] with the [[Seattle]] PD and his one man campaign to crack down on [[niggers|human roadkill]] outside a Seattle high school. 

On June 14th, [[2010]] Officer '''Ian P. Walsh''' saw four [[Whore|female]] pedestrians [[Stupid|jaywalking]] outside Seattle's Franklin High School. The officer instructed the females to step over to his vehicle. When one of them, a 19-year-old [[negress]] by the name of [[Sheneequa|Angel L. Rosenthal]] began to walk away, the officer approached her and escorted her back. After the [[16 year old girl|teen]] tried to pull away from Boss Hogg, the two argued and the officer attempted to [[rape|handcuff]] her. That is when another of the teens -one [[Power Word|Marilyn Ellen Levias]]- decided to '[[white_knight|intervene]]' and [[Dumb|grabbed at the officer's arm in an attempt to hinder the arrest]]. At this point, Officer Hogg had no choice but to [[pwnt|knock a bitch out]].

The crowd that had gathered around to record the whole brouhaha [[butthurt|reacted with shock]] and the main cameraman starts in with the: '''"Are you serious?!"''' bullshit. Apparently he was, so the punchee [[GTFO|was pulled out of the situation]] as the police officer proceeded to try to handcuff Ms. Rosenthal. "[[Smart|Do not struggle]]," the cop orders the woman during the video.

Both teens were ticketed for jaywalking. Ms. Rosenthal was booked into the King County Jail for [[cock block|obstructing]] an officer. Ms. Levias was booked into the Youth Service Center for assault of an officer using her [[Ugly|face]] as a weapon. The year before, she had been arrested for the same thing, proving black person are [[Asspies|incapable of learning]].

[[LOL|Nobody was injured during the incident, police said]].

The fact that the drama revolves around a [[white man]] in a [[The Man|position of authority]] who had to [[pwn|put down]] a belligerent [[16-year-old|19-year-old]] [[black]] girl has [[white people|the internet]] all atwitter about [[racism|the racial implications]] of the incident.

==Just The Facts Ma'm==
===[[Libertarian]] Perspective===
Some [[Fascist|jackbooted cop]] was on the prowl looking to hassle citizens (as an overfed and corrupt [[fascist]] government system breeds such things), in attempt to lure them into getting aggressive and escalating a [[Fight_Club|confrontation]]. When the cop finally found some arcane law to charge the citizens with, they rightfully [[Protest|resisted]], and in return, the cop recklessly wielded state power and used excessive force in apprehending. But what do you expect with high taxes and free health care? Slippery slope, people.  

===[[Liberal]] Perspective===
Two black person [[oxymoron|straight-A honors students]] were minding their own business and discussing what [[KFC|Ivy League university]] they'd be accepting a scholarship to, when [[racist]] cop sneaked up behind them and [[pwnt|beat them half to death]] with his [[Penis|nightstick]], while screaming [[truth|'die niggers!]]' at the top of his lungs. He then put on a [[KKK]] mask and proceeded to burn a giant cross. The two students are reportedly in critical condition now, while the cop has been given a medal by the mayor of [[Seattle]].

===[[Redneck]] Perspective===
Some niggers and [[jews]] crossed the road so a good police officer [[Great_justice|ENFORCED THE LAW]]. Being disrespectful niggers, they resisted rightful arrest, and the police officer HAD to use force to restrain the [[Negress|black girl's ape strength]].

===black person Perspective===
[[Ebonics|Daaaaaaammmnnnn son]].

===Cameraman's Perspective===
[[Are You Serious?]]

===[[4chan]] Perspective===
[[DOUBLE NIGGER]]!!! [[Falcon Punch|FALCON PUNCH]]!!! [[DESU|DESU DESU DESU]]!!! [[So Cash|SHIT WAS SO CASH]]!!! [[DESU|TYPE DESU AGAIN]]!!! [[DESU|NEEDS MOAR DESU]]!!! [[DESU]]!!!

===[[ED]] Perspective===
[[Jews]] did [[9/11|6/14!]]

===[[Oxymoron|The Truth Perspective]]===
The intersection where the incident took place is a particularly dangerous, pedestrian unfriendly one that had seen [[Over_9000|over 50]] accidents during the past few years. The potential for jaywalking accidents was in fact worrisome enough that Franklin High's principal and the school district felt the need to ask cops to make their presence known at the bus stop where [[Loli|school kids]] would congregate after school and patrol the area to enforce the law, however trivial, so as to prevent further injury to the students.

{{quote|But, uh, ever since people get punched in the face, no one wants to jaywalk no more.|Ronnae Redmond, 17, justifying [[police brutality]]}}


So Boss Hogg was actually [[Nazi|just following orders]] and doing his job when he had his run-in with the [[asshats|obstreperous jaywalking teens]]. When a mob of [[Faggots|unruly kids with no respect for the law]] or those charged with their safety started to congregate around the officer and the [[USI|uncooperative]], foul-mouthed Rosenthal, the situation was already tense. When Levias decided to insert herself into the equation by [[Dumb|physically attempting to stop the officer]] from doing his duty (by pushing and pulling on a man with a [[gun]]), things quickly ran to the edge of [[Iraq|spinning totally out of control]]. Given all this, Officer Walsh showed remarkable [[rape|professionalism and restraint]].

[[TL;DR]]: she's lucky he didn't [[Don't Tase Me Bro|tase her ass]] or go full-on [[Rodney King]].

Naturally, with such a [[lulz|charged topic]], the debate on the [[niggers|racial overtones]] and [[pwn|excessive use of force]] by [[The Man]] surrounding this incident has been equally [[flame war|as charged]]. Since the Internets affords [[racists|white people]] absolute freedom of speech via the magic cloak of [[anon|anonymity]] that [[IRL]] codes of conduct keep apparent [[moralfags]] from [[politically correct|telling it like it is]], everyone can let it all hang out. Plus -with the exception of [[Twitter]]- there are There are no black people on the Internet so it's pretty much like preaching to the choir.

|After careful analysis of the video and trying my best to give the two girls the benefit of the doubt, I have come to the conclusion that.....yea she [[asking for it|totally deserved that]]...and some mace...plus a taze...and maybe a bullet. Ok maybe not the bullet but definitely the mace and the taze.|[http://intensedebate.com/people/watchurchin watchurchin]
|Seems to me like [[tinfoil hat|it might be a set up]]! Someone with a camera [[yes|was just there??!!!]] I feel this is going to be happening alot with the recent lawsuits against the Seattle PD....sad....|[http://intensedebate.com/people/anxietycrow anxietycrow]

|The officer should be fired...for telegraphing the punch and for not even decking the crazy hambeast. WTF kind of 'punch' was that?|[[Anon]]
|That was turrable...just turrable.ï»¿ What the hell was he thinking? You can't do shit like that in public any more what with every Tom, Dick, Harry and Jamaal having a camphone. He should've thrown 'em in the back of the riot van and given 'em good duffing up like they used to do to lippy kids back in the day.|Anon}}</center>

==The Apology==
After all the [[shit|media hype]], the [[bitch|nigra]] who brutally assaulted the officer with her face [http://www.komonews.com/news/local/96685729.html apologized to the officer.] He then bitched her out for several minutes on the importance of not [[Rape|putting ones hands]] on an officer of [[Rule 34|the law.]] The [[fail|failure]] of the situation to escalate into further [[lulz]] <s>now guarantees the proliferation of mortal combat remixes of the video</s> it has already begun, see above.
