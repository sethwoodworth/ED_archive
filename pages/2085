David Cerny

'''David Černý''' is a sculptor and an [[IRL]] [[troll]] from the Czech Republic. After years of having severely [[pwn]][[ed]] his own country on too many occasions to count, Cerny grew bored of trolling the same place all the time and decided to troll all of Europe. He succeeded in January 2009 and received [[over 9,000]] <s>Canadian dollars</s> euro for his [[lazy|hard]] work, proving the power of [[old memes]] - specifically, that [[successful troll]] can indeed be extremely successful.

==[[Pwning]] [[Europe]]==

In 2008, Cerny made more money than [[you]] by getting 50 grand in grant from the [[fail|European Council]], in return for working with sculptors from the 27 European Union nations, in order to create and exhibit 27 sculptures codenamed "Entropa" to honor those nations. Cerny then [[trolling IRL|tastefully trolled]] the whole continent by delivering on time, but explaining that he took the instructions to mean that rather than honor the countries, he was supposed to [[rape|"honor"]] them.

And that he [[pwn|did]]. Although, regrettably, the exhibition lacks any trace of [[mudkips]], the black person or [[34]], the sculptures make up for those shortcomings by depicting each country as follows:

* [[Germany]] is shown simply in its satellite view, with the country's highways forming [[swastika|the official symbol]] of [[Nazi|Germany]].
* [[Australia|Austria (Australia)]] is a [[Austria|fucking]] nuclear plant, with a barely visible symbolic [[Fritzl|cellar]].
* [[Finland]] depicts its [[Mr_Saari|most famous citizen]], [[drunk|having freshly ingested Finland's only edible product]] and looking for friends through his rifle scope.
* [[Spain]] covers its ugliness by flooding itself with concrete.
* Holland is also flooded with what may be water or urine; only the [[Osama|peaceful]] [[Islam|religion]] survives the flood.
* [[France]] is shown surrendering to striking workers.
* [[Poland]] raises a huge flag of [[gay]] pride, upheld by the hands of [[Pedobear|priests and nuns]].
* [[Belgium]] is a box of [[scat|chocolates]], symbolizing that you never know what you'll find in the country: [[goatse|emptiness]], [[shit|rat droppings]], [[cum|stale food]] - the choice is vast.
* Luxembourg is [[whore|all for sale]].
* Italy is nothing but a soccer field, full of [[gay]] players.
* Bulgaria is a toilet urinated on by the mighty [[Turkey]].
* [[Denmark]] is a bunch of Lego blocks forming the [[Islam|holy]] snout of [[Mohammad]].
* Romania sucks, although this time it's through Dracula's teeth.
* Estonia is nothing but [[Russia|hammer and sickle]].
* Lithuania invites death by disputin' the [[Putin]] through the power of piss.
* Malta is a [[lie|big]] pocket elephant.
* [[Sweden]] is cheaply packaged into a crappy Ikea box, with several parts missing.
* Cerny's own Czech Republic is a flashing display of some of the most [[stupid|famous]] quotes from its [[batshit insane|controversial]] president, which is really a bit of a cowardly cop-out, as there is a [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Fritzl#A_Challenger_Appears.21 considerably more famous internets Czech patriot] out there.
* Slovakia is a sausage aimed at the hungry, hungry Hungarians, as true Hungarian men love to smoke the sausage.
* Hungary itself is, of course, a sausage, and an ecologically radioactive one, too.
* Slovenia is a rock honoring the first <s>invaders</s> tourists who [[pwned|visited]] the country in 1213.
* (f)Latvia is just a snowy mountain.
* [[Portugal]] has [[Maddie|beef]] with [[No one|everyone]].
* [[Cyprus]]'s two halves [[h8|warmly embrace]] each other.
* [[Greece]] is [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|killed with fire]].
* [[Ireland]] is a [[furry]] [[fart|bagpipe]]; potatoes are inside.
* [[Britain]] is [[ban|kickbanned]] from the exhibition, as it does not belong anywhere near Europe.

==Aftermath==

[[Image:Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Turks pee in <i>this</i>?]]

While the [[fail|European Council]] itself was [[pissed|enthusiastic]] and wanted to [[lynch|recommission]] Cerny, the exhibition resulted in massive [[butthurt|outcry]] from several depicted countries (and applause or boredom from the others). All of the butthurt countries claimed to have nothing in common with their portrayals; aiming to prove it, Holland's Dutch Party promptly announced a jihad on Cerny, [[Nazi|Germany]] called him a Jew and threatened to [[Holocaust|put him in the hot spot]], Slovakia tried to [[blowjob|bribe]] him, and Bulgaria was so pissed <s>on</s> off that its words of protest only came out as sounds of gargling. Groups of [[Ireland|Irish]] patriots were also [[rage|concerned]] with the fact that Cerny did not include the UK - "them fookin' English bastards got off easy like!".

Reacting to that, Cerny issued an apologetic response and a deeply moving explanation: "[[YHBT]]".

==Trolling Redux==
With the sounds of [[butthurt]] still loud, Cerny proved his trolling prowess further by rubbing salt in the wounds and admitting that none of the other 26 sculptors actually existed, their biographies and quotes were all made up by him, he was the designer of all the sculptures, and he pocketed all the [[over 9000|millions]] of [[money|Czech dollars]] that the sculptors were supposed to share. This time, however, Cerny managed to suppress the [[flames]] and avoid causing further outcry by admitting: "[[I did it for the lulz]]".
