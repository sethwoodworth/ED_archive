'''Tory "Magoo" Christman''' is  [[legend]] and a [[BFF]] of [[Anonymous]]. After 30 years in the [[Church of $cientology]] she walked out on them after finding out that her 'job' -creating 100s of [[sock]] accounts on [[Usenet]]'s [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/browse_thread/thread/c0976de8b6d1c384/ca7608a087a8a6f0#ca7608a087a8a6f0 alt.religion.scientology]-  was a part of a [[Co$]] operation to stifle free speech, snuff out the exchange of information and [[lies|'manipulate' intel]] for the 'church's' [[1337]] [[Scientology|OSA]] department of dirty tricks. 
Since then, she has spent almost every waking hour exposing the inner workings of the [[cult]] and fearlessly protesting outside Los Angeles [[Co$]] buildings without a [[V]] mask (or any kind of mask, for that matter). Tory is exactly twice as tall as David Miscabbage..

Tory was admittedly a [[hippy]] and a rebel in the 60's.  That free spirit is what initially led her into the Co$ AND what made her [[GTFO]]. As of July 2008 she has also achieved passing notoriety for trolling [[Thunderdome]] and causing [[namefag]] [[faggoth|kids]] to [[BAWWW]].

==Magoo joins teh [[serious business|Secret Co$ Internet Mafia]]==

[[Image:tory-in-what-is-scientology-crop.jpg|thumb|Magoo in her Scientology days.]]

{{squote|We have a plan of action that we are taking, to simply [[crapflood|outcreate]] the [[truth|entheta]] on these newsgroups...If you imagine 40-50 [[basement dwellers|Scientologists]] posting on the Internet every few days, we'll just [[spam|run the SP's right off the system]].  It will be quite simple, actually...
|Elaine Siegel, OSA, mid-90s}}

In the mid-to-late 90s, [[Al Gore|Al Goar]]'s shiny new [[tubes|intertubes]] were fuggin' HAWT and the Co$ wanted a big, [[Nazi|jackbooted]] presence on them, especially to "handle" ([[STFU|silence]]) their critics, who were causing them major [[butthurt|publicity problems]].  Sites like [http://www.xenu.net Xenu.net] and especially [[alt.religion.scientology]] were all deemed [[asking for it|'Supressives']] and targeted for [[raep|destruction]].

Magoo, by then a trusted [[1337|top-level]] Scio, was recruited into the OSA's [[Final Solution|master plan]] , required to sign a [[paranoid|secrecy oath]] attesting to the [[Serious business|TOP TOP SECRET]] nature of the project and told to NEVAR EVAR talk about it. (EVAR!)

A period followed in which she was given cash to open [[sockpuppets|multiple ISP accounts]] under fake names, initially in Hollywood but then at various locations throughout  the country, always using bogus local phone numbers and addresses and always with the OSA  paying for her [[hookers and blow|food, lodging and travel]] expenses. Eventually, the OSA improved their [[CSIII|skills]] in birthing sockpuppets, working strictly over the phone with untraceable pre-paid phonecards and using fake addresses of [[PROTIP|mailboxes they hadn't even rented]] for the accounts.

When she asked [[wtf|what all these accounts were for]], she was told "Tory, [[Spam|you don't want to know]]. If you know, they'll get you in [[e-court|court]] and [[lolsuit|depose you]] FOREVER. If you [[LOL WUT|don't know]], you can honestly say, "[[No U|I don't know]]". Magoo, though uneasy, [[noob|knew little about computers]] and didn't really think much about it at the time.

So, what WAS going on? Fucking. [[Epic]]. Carnage. [[OTI]] .

==Oh, It's ON! The Co$ [[Anti-lulz]] Raid Begins ==

[[Image:gavino-idda.jpg|thumb|Gavino Idda (Sea Org, OSA), one of the capos in the war on a.r.s., was [[serious business|SRSLY]] pissed at Magoo for quitting Operation Crapflood.]]
Unbeknownst to Magoo, in the Glendale apartment of a Scientologist named [[Lesbian|Lizzy]], 4 or 5 [[Internet Hate Machine|computers]] were systematically raeping the living shit out of [[Usenet]] in general, and [[alt.religion.scientology]] in particular, in an [[anti-lulz]] [[raid]] of [[epic]] proportions. The [[butthurt]] was endless and unrelenting and, this being the 90s, there were no [[Security_Faggotry|advanced anti-faggotry countermeasures]] to defend the realm. Everybody was a fucking n00b !!1!

The main thrust of the assault were so-called "sporgeries" ( a neologism coined by an ARS member: "spam" + "forgery"). 'Sporge' was simply a [[crapflood]] of messages that forged the name of legit users to long, bullshit messages like " [[ENGLISH_MOTHERFUCKER_DO_YOU_SPEAK_IT|Above no cough at no writer every considerate profit addressed]]" etc . Cancelbots were developed, but more often then not, they were simply mopping up [[scat|shitstorms]] that couldn't be stopped. The effect was to render ARS [[TL;DR|un-fucking-readable]]. Of course, to cover their tracks the OSA didn't just raep ARS- they spread the pain all over Usenet in an attempt to make it look like the work of some random [[haxorz|hackers]], which fooled exactly [[Noone|three people]]. 

That wasn't the only card up their [[ass|sleeve]]. The OSA also:
* issued bogus Usenet "[[balete|remove group]]" commands, to [[delete fucking everything|delete the newsgroup]] from newsgroup servers worldwide. 
*issued equally bogus "[[KILL_IT_WITH_FIRE|cancel article]]" commands, [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|deleting articles]] by critics of Scientology.
*posted "Dead Agent" propaganda- slanders on critics, or [http://holysmoke.org/forgeries/heads.zip neo-Nazi gibberish] with the target critic's name and addy forged onto it (in keeping with Hubbard's "Fair Game" Policy).
*posted random paragraphs of [[copypasta|Scientology quotes]] over and over and [[creepypasta|overandoverandover]]... 
Eventually, Magoo saw the all the [[retarded|nonsensical]] messages and realized  she'd been [[Pwnd|used]]. Being a [[hippy]] at heart, and strongly believing in free speech, she couldn't help but feel guilty, even if she didn't quite understand what was going on. She begged off the project, which pissed off her OSA bosses big-time. What she's since called her "Truman Show" had started to fall apart.

==I Was a Troll For The Co$==
[[Image:Gavino_Idda_Impact_35-27_1991.jpg|thumb|Gavino Idda again, in a 1991 picture. [[Gay|John Waters]] will play him in the movie.]]

But nobody just up and leaves this cult, especially after [[hivemind|30 years]] and thousands of dollars spent, so Magoo did what a lot of Scios probably do everyday- she sublimated her growing doubts and kept trying to go thru the motions. Her way of doing this was to [[E-Jihad|personally]] take to the internet in defense of the Co$. Under the screen name "Magoo", she became the biggest OSA online [[troll]] evar.

Though she was a total n00b, she was [[internet tough guy|damned ferocious]], surfing to ARS and critic's sites and starting [[flame wars]] with fucking EVERYONE. What she lacked in [[LOL WUT|readability]], she more than made up for in [[Hardcore|zeal]] and ad hominem insult. For weeks on end, she kept at it with a [[HAGGER|Hagger]]-like tenacity, becoming the single most frequent poster on ARS, even singling out [[Wise Beard Man]] for regular beatdowns!!1!  (They're [[BFF]]s now and [[Wise Beard Man]] has since remarked "I was amazed that this nice person could be so damned nasty [[anonymous]]ly.")

Considerable debate raged on ARS about the identity of this fearsome and [[english is not my native language|non-sequitur]] troll. Some were sure this "Magoo" was six people using the same nick, others feared it was some kind of new bot. Some even speculated that "Magoo" was [[David Miscarriage|David Miscavige]] herself!  But everyone agreed on the basics: "Magoo" was an obviously [[batshit|batshit-crazy]] n00b who wasn't very good at arguing or debate. So, possibly for [[lulz]], Andreas Heldal-Lund, the owner of Operation Clambake, decided to write "Magoo" a [[kung fu|friendly little email]] with some [[PROTIP|pointers]] on how her posts could be a little moar [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|intelligible]]. 

The effect was unexpected. Magoo was [[ZOMG|stunned]]. Someone she'd thought of as the devil "...had not only sent me a nice message, he had offered me useful advice...". Being a nice person [[IRL]], Magoo sent him a thank-you note and they began to [[It was a social experiment|email one another regularly]]. It wasn't long before conversing with a normal person brought the whole "Truman Show" crashing down. Magoo decided to [[GTFO]].

==Scouting For Feb 10th==
[[Image:Lolk_tory.jpg|thumb|right|how Tory views Anon IRL]]
On Saturday, Feb. 2nd, '''Magoo''' assisted a 1337 [[Anonymous]] Special Ops advance team to scout [[Project Chanology]]'s main L.A. target for the EPIC '''[[2/10|tenth of two]]''' WIN. With her insider knowledge of "Big Blue" -Co$' massive Sunset and Vermont complex- the five man team casually cased the joint  like they were your everyday tourists with a tour guide's running commentary pointing out key locations and what went on behind closed doors there. These YouTubes give a peek at the 'guided tour' and end with a message to the 'church' to not only expect Anonymous, but to '''expect her!'''
===Part One===

NB: Tory stated that this was the first time in 8 years of walking or picketing near the building (since she quit Co$ in 2000) that she wasn't harassed or even approached by security.

==Tory Thanks Anonymous For Delivering on [[2/10]]==
{{squote|I have to tell you, I've been in touch with various people who are "Anonymous" --(no [[OSA]], there isn't a "[[Mrfetch|Who]]" -- I just mean people).

I can't say enough how proud I am to have been in touch with these people, of all ages, and watched them learn and grow *so* fast...

I tell you, it was A M A Z I N G  to picket with over 500 people here in LA. Basically, they're standing up for Free Speech, Against Scientology breaking up families, lying about their x-members, and all the abusive things they have done in the past...

#???
#<s>[[Profit]]</s> [[BAWWWWW]]!

===What Part Of "Anonymous" Don't You Faggots Understand?===

Another reason the daggers were out for Magoo is that a number of excitable [[moralfag]]s got all giddy over her at a [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY/OPERATION_SPY_VS_SCI|protest]] and forked over their [[dox]] so that they could get [[leet]] bragging rights. Displaying her usual level of [[fail|aptitude]] with technology, she proceeded to call them up to try and convince them to unmask and become full-time activists. Then the [[OSA]] stole her itemized phone bill.

The ramifications and hyperbole that followed the wake of Magoogate are dissected below.

{| border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 
|'''Theory'''||'''Analysis'''
|- 
|Magoo never quit the [[OSA]]! She's, like, some [[OMG]] SUPER DEEP COVER SCILON TROLL SENT TO DESTROY [[Anon|ANONYMOUS!!!1]]||Even in the paranoid aftermath of an anti-OSA raid, pretty laughable.
|- 
|ZOMG MAGOO IS SO '''MEEEEEEEEN!''' We thought she was '''NICE!'''||No, seriously, [[what|WHICH]] part of [[Anonymous]] don't you faggots understand?
|-
|Magoo is fucking cuckoo, and has years of dangerous troll training behind her. You really shouldn't fuck with her. ANYONE who actually bothered to keep up with [[IRL|the real world]] instead of idolizing her already knew this and dug her anyway. Nothing has changed, apart from a bunch of [[unwarranted self-importance|self-important kiddies]] getting an awkward [[pwnt|schooling]] vis-a-vis the fact that "Never give out your real name and contact details to anyone at a protest" does '''not''' mean "Never give out your real name and contact details to anyone unless you're trying to bask in the proximity of their e-fame."||Absolutely, 100% true. Now [[GTFO]] MY INTERNETS AND STOP FAGGING UP MY CHANOLOGY.
