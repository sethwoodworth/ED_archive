L0pht
[[Image:Lopht_Logo.jpg|thumb|right|h4X0ring -- for fun and profit!]] 

'''l0pht''' was a [[h4X0r]] group who sold out to [[the Man]]. They created l0phtCrack -- a tool that helps [[crack]]ers decipher your passwords.  But then they decided to be all nice about it and tell companies that their systems were insecure.  Soon, they quit their day jobs and started their own company.  Symantec then bought them out.  Just think: the people who are purportedly protecting you from crackers are the very ones who produced the tools that allowed them to break into your system in the first place!

==Company Process==
#Create insecurity 
#Solve the insecurity
#[[????]]
#[[Profit!]]

While they were never all that funny, they did produce [[lulz]] when, in 1998, they told [[politician|Congress]] that they could shut off the [[internets]] in 30 minutes. They continued to advise in technology issues to leading politicians like [[Ted Stevens]].
