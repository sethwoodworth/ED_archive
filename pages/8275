The New York Times
[[File:NewYorkTimes.svg.png|center|400px|The Jew York Times]]
The '''Jew York Times''' is a [[newspaper|rag]] for [[butthurt|whiny]] [[leftard|liberals]].  Ironic, considering it was started by a member of [[NWO|Skull and Bones]] who was also the [[Republican|RNC chairman]].  Sold to filthy [[redneck|secessionist-supporting]] kikes, it has remained a family business and [[old media]] staple.

As all [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|good sites]] know, [[drama]] is good for views.  The Times figured this out well before the [[internet]]s were ever conceived.  Let's take a look at some of their successes.

===Times v. Sullivan===
New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, was a US Supreme Court case which established the [[User:D-Malice|actual malice]] standard which has to be met before press reports about public officials or public figures can be considered to be defamation and libel.  Lol, free speech.

===The Pentagon Papers===
In 1971, the Pentagon Papers, a secret US Department of Defense history of their political and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1971, were [[wikileaks|leaked]] to Neil Sheehan of The New York Times by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them.  [[Bradley Manning|Sound familiar?]]

Affirmative action smiled upon our boy Jayson Blair, giving him the opportunity to write for one of the most-read newspapers in the country.  Instead, he chose to [[Portal:Gaming|play Xbox]] and guzzle 'purple drank'.  When his [[ediot|editor]] asked for content, he'd just run to the web and [[copypasta|grab some]].  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Blair#Plagiarism_and_fabrication_scandal No one would ever be the wiser].  

===[[Weev]] Coverage===
[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html The Trolls Among Us] features our very own prophet.  Are they in on [[the game|it]]?
