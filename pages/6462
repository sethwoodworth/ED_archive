{{fyi|the PS3 has NO GAEMS}}


The '''PlayStation 3''' (otherwise known as the '''Piece of Shit 3''', '''PS3''', '''PSTripple''', '''Playstashun 3''' or [[orly|'''NOGAEMSBOX''']]) is Sony's next-gen game console that costs one limb and your first-born child. It will continue in the tradition of [[no|quality]] for which the [[Playstation]] line of products is known (i.e. it will be among the most useless creations ever conceived by man). It is noteworthy for costing more than a copy of Battletoads for the Wii, and including a bunch of unnecessary shit like a Blu-ray drive, shit internet connections and a SIXAXIS controller for you to screw around with. All while using enough bandwith and power to support a Third World country.

The hardware of the PS3 consists of the cell processor, which runs on the tears of Muslim orphans and alkaline batteries, and the [[shit|RSX GPU]] (which is actually an outdated G70 chip). 


==Hackers in my PS3?==
A virgin by the name of George Hotz successfully hacked the unhackable ps3 after over three years. Why? Because Sony had decided that it was a [[facepalm|bright idea]] to remove the Other OS feature that allowed the PS3 to actually do something. They later felt that a PS3 owner installing Linux on PS3 was a threat. Hackers like geohot (the dark alex of PS3) raged as Linux is their playground and having the Other OS feature taken away was the last straw. If Sony didn't take this feature off like they did with backwards compatibility and multiple USB ports, hackers like geohot wouldn't have had to fuck Sony up any further. In retrospect, Sony's [[faggotry]] has backfired on themselves ten-fold and it's their own fault. Geohot found out a way to find Sony's private key just by using simple algebra to figure it out. Anyone can run their own pirates games now or get anything for free on the store. Sony can't fix this issue as they would have to get new hardware. Since then, the flood gates have opened and [[over 9000]] hackers have released an ocean of hacks for PS3. It has literally has become a nightmare to Sony as it was with the [[PSP]]. Fanboys of course raged over this. This is now known as The Great PS3 - Hacker Wars. Now, the PS3 has became an infinite goldmine of possibilities and trolling PS3 Fanboys has never been easier.. and somebody at Sony just got fired!

'''[[fail|EXTRA! EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT. SONY SUES geohot.]]'''

Not long after the masterkey and other hacks that Sony went butthurt and decided to try to pwn geohot by taking it to the courts. Sony's lawyers even tried to falsifie evidence by saying he agreed to the PSN disclaimer agreement. Sony had yet another [[retard|genius idea]] by creating a PSN screen name that is supposed to be geohot to try to incriminate him. This tactic has back fired because, get this, they got his handle and location wrong. [[IRC]], geohot is known as just simply '''geohot''' and he lives in [[New Jersey]]. The alleged account that Sony's lawyers made up is called "Geo1Hotz" and says that he is located in [[Rhode Island]]. Lulz ensued when geohot's lawyer stated this. In other words, Sony has made their situation even worse and geohot might consider counter-suing.. and someone else is getting fired! Read it for your self to laugh.

'''Want to troll Sony? Simply add the account Geo1Hotz to your friends list and greet Sony with a message. Added lulz if you come up with a creative lulzy message and post photo.'''

'''Fan boy's cry'''

It wasn't until hackers flooded multiplayer games sepcifically Modern Warefare 2 that PS3 fan boy's started to sob. What the asshole hackers did on the servers was bypass Infinity Wards' security and contributed to many lulz. Hackers were invincible, had infinite ammo, and even erased stats of countless innocents who were unfortunate to cross them. This of course lead to butthurt on a massive scale. Trolling MW2 had been taken to a new level. Players started to complain to PSN and Infinity Ward, but nothing could be done. Activision (who now owns Call of Duty) told Sony to fly right and stop fucking around or else they will discontinue service! Uh-oh, do you know what this means? No more Call of Duty for PS3. If this can be done on MW2, then other games will soon fall victim. EA was smart to take action early when it came to the release of Dead Space 2, players must pay to play online on EA servers because of Sony's fail. That's right! If you want to dismember some necromorphs with your buddies, you better have that credit card ready. The future of PS3 has taken a turn for the worse, but who didn't see this comming. After all, this is a system that it's best game was the fucking blue ray movie Superman 2!

{{quote|lets see jailbroken consoles already ruining online games like MW2, apps that enable instant trophies, next a wave of F@ggL@ggers hacking online accounts and stealing personal info and for what, because I wannaaaaa run homebrewwwww, I wannaaaaa run linuuuuux, such bullshit, all this asshole Geonotsohot did was fuck it up for the ppl that just want to play games on an even playing field. Hackers hack my old Nutts. LOL| sonyyoco, you can tell buy the name what he is really}}

{{quote|WAAAAAAA I CAN’T PLAY MW2 BECAUSE OF HACKERS! WAA WAA PS3 HACKERS ARE MESSING IT UP FOR REAL PLAYERS LIKE ME WAAAAAAAAAAAA! IT’S GEOHOTZ FAULT!

Lol you fan boys bitch too much, whats done is done. Sony had it coming. They took other OS out, took away backwards compatibility, offer shit service, made their shit system expensive, and what not. They were too cocky. How bad does it hurt to know that people are downloading games for free while your pathetic selves have to either save up enough of your allowance, ask mommy and daddy to buy it, or spend your hard earn money on the same game? A lot. I bet half of you on this forum even have an iPod or a PSP that’s jailbroken already. Hypocrites aren’t we all? LMFAO cry me a river. Enjoy your stats.. while you have them! lulz| a troll who is about to get a bunch of feed back pretty soon}}

==ApocalyPS3==
[[File:Ps3nothing.gif|right|thumb|It literally does nothing now.]]

ApocalyPS3 is the day the PS3 broke and thousands of fanboys ragequit from the PS3 forever because they lost their favorite trophies. Some may have lost their trophies permanently because of one time only online trophies. People are getting an 8001050F error which does not allow players worldwide from signing into PSN, accessing trophy information, and even playing particular games offline. The PS3 officially lived up to the title of NOGAEMSBOX.

==SIXAXIS Controller==
[[Image:Ps3 is broken.jpg|thumb|left|Typical Playstation 3 Demo]]
Also known as the rich man's Wiimote, with so many people gagging to see the best copy-pasta in console control history, it would be poor form for Sony to actually deliver something that was any more useful than a sack of potatoes before the Irish famine. Hailed as a new and exciting piece of technology that would render the old wheel and shift stick control packs obsolete, everyone acted surprised when it worked about as accurately as controlling a space shuttle with your flaccid penis- which everyone expected, but outrage is so much fun to have. The worst part about this piece of shit was that Sony had the bright idea, yet again, to remove the vibration feature. Why? because Sony claimed that a dual shock six-axis would fuck up the six axis motion thus shortening the life span of the controller. To no surprise, six axis controllers already were flimsy, buttons got stuck, and broke easily from even the slightest tap. With out a dual shock, gamers were lost. Then, a few people modded their six-axis controllers buy taking parts from their PS2 dual shock controllers. They showed off their modded six axis controllers with vibration and called bullshit on Sony. A year and a half later, Sony release dualshock 3 controllers with six axis tech. When ordinary people do what your hired and highly experienced staff can't, then you know you failed.

==Games==
[[Image:PS3noGame.png|thumb|right|[[¯\(°_o)/¯]]]]

Even the shittiest of consoles can have good games (as demonstrated by the Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo Gamecube).  Unfortunately, this is barely the case with the PlayStation 3. While the great majority of games on this godforsaken console were made by a 16 year old using RPGMaker, there are a few games that stick out.

=====[[Warhawk]]=====
:Warhawk is an online multiplayer game that is always a piece of shit. Was to be a Halo killer. It's just an unstable pile of AIDS with people hosting servers on their unstable bandwith.

If you feel like telling Warhawk how much you hate it please contact Warhawk admin PSN: steviecricket

=====Haze=====
:Allegedly was intended to be a [[Halo]] killer of sorts. It was over hyped by before it arrived on shelves. When it did, thousands of fanboys spent their allowence to buy it only to find out it sucked. A month after it's release, Haze was placed in the bargain bin at every local Gamestop.

====Resistance: Fall of Man====
:Yet another [[Quake]] ripoff set in the early 1950's.

=====[[Metal Gear Solid|Metal Gear Solid 4]]=====
:Gameplay is consisted of hide, shoot, hide, cutscene, repeat.

=====LittleBigPlanet=====
:This game lets you make anything, but the game developers didn't realize that everyone just wanted to make giant cocks.

=====[[Final Fantasy XIII]]=====
:Final Fantasy XIII involves a girl saving the world from the evil organization with every other cliche. This game doesn't really count as a "good ps3 game" because Square-Enix sold out to Microsoft because they rather actually get money because no one buys ps3 games.

=====MAG=====
:Over hyped [[Call of Duty]] that kept basement dwellers from all corners at the edge of their gaming chair for about 4 years. When it came out, it was dubbed a piece of shit.

=====Uncharted=====
:A Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones knock off. Though not as good because at least in Tomb Raider you get to stare at boobs for the whole game. However the makers do a great job at trolling because the makers of Tomb Raider are so butthurt they are now making their new Tomb Raider game seem more like Uncharted.

====Demon's Souls====
:A game no one plays because it's too hard.

[[File: Best PS3 game ever.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Playstation 3 game.]]

====Heavy Rain====
:The best part of the game is pressing X to Jason! Oh and Scott Shelby is the killer.

====Super-Man 2?====
When the PS3 first came out, this was the best game and only game that was available.. and it's a fucking blueray movie!

==Trophies==
[[File:YOURE WINNER trophy.jpg|left|thumb|This makes losing your social life a little less shitty, right?]]
As shown by the sheer amount of time 14 year olds spend trying to get all the trophies on Halo 3, unlockable achievements greatly increase the playtime that a game appeals to [[Special:WhatLinksHere/PlayStation 3|those]] who have fifteen extra hours.  Therefore, instead of adding more useless content (like anybody wants that), developers have taken to adding forty trophies.  Actual examples include:
*Malpractice Needs More Practice
*Rope-a-dope-a-dope
*Vermin Champion
*All Stars
and of course
*Win an online Sit and Go Tournament of 2 to 7 triple draw

==Peripherals==

===PlayStation Eye===

The PlayStation Eye add-on was intended as a high resolution optical pickup device capable of detecting the most intricate amount of detail for game such as ''Eye Of Judgment''; instead it’s used for capturing the stunned look of losers playing ''Burnout Paradise'' in just their urine stained underwear with their bitch tits hanging over their binge-induced beer guts, laying about in their [[Basement Dweller|grotty bedsits]]. It is fact that 90% of Playstation Eyes have seen more than any eye should see.

===Dualshock 3===

After stating for months that the Sixaxis controller was designed without rumble because it contained sensitive tilt switches that would be made inoperable by the rumble feature, [[Sony]] decided to do a complete U-turn and add rumble anyway; Not because of any technological improvements, but because they decided to give in to a bunch of Intellectual Property [[trolls]] who claimed to hold the patent to this feature. This news was greatly welcomed by PS3 fanatics worried that they wouldn't be able to play Modern Warfare 2 with 'realistic bullet recoil'.

===Playstation Move===
Rip off of the Wii.
* Also used as sex toy (AKA) Dildo
* Much Smoother and more niggerish version of WiiMote (Used as dildos for girls who like it rougher)

This particular useless plastic crap has an interesting yet never the less, laughable back story. During E3 06, at Sony's press conference, The president of Sony of America, when asked about his opinions on the Wii, stated that the Wii will never catch on, no one will buy it, no body wants to move around. Fast forward to 2010, the Wii is still the highest selling home console at 1st place, Xbox 360 at 2nd, PS3 at last. Sony of course loosing, decides to invent [[Wii|a pair of controllers that the player moves to interact with the video game to give the feeling of being actually in the game. One for motioning and another for moving.]] Does it sound familiar? [[lies|Of course it doesn't because Sony makes nothing but masterpieces.]] They wanted to be original so like they do with every peripheral or console since 2000, they paint it black. Also OOOOOOOOOO it has a glowing colorful ball AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

==Unveiling At E3==

In 2006 Playstation thought that to be [[pretty cool guy|pretty cool]] to try and boost its popularity by competing alongside [[Xbox]] and [[Wii]]; this backfired horribly. After get assraped numerous times in terms of price, quality, avaliablity and games, Playstation decided to release PS3 in December where it failed epically in the console battle. Below is a complete summary of it's [[failure]]:

<center><youtube>IH2w2l1JTs4</youtube></center>

Of course it's not fair to blame the console. It's not the PS3's fault that it's shit; PSP established that. Judging by the audience's response to <i>[[Gay|Ridge Racer]]</i>, one can only imagine how well the [[Fail|PS4]] shall do.

<center><font size=7>FUCK YEAH RIIIIIIDGE RACER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</font></center>

==GNU/Linux== 
As its disgusting fat father, the PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 3 also has the ability to boast something only [[Basement-dweller|basement dwellers]] and [[science|rocket scientists]] use. 

After the elite [[script kiddie|hacker]] Geohot released information about being able to use the PS3's shitty hardware, before blocked from being accessed by 3rd party operating systems,including its hidden fanboy dildo feature, Sony began go [[apeshit]] and removed the [[Lunix]] feature. 

Fanboys began [[Waaaambulance|bawwing]] as a feature they don't even use disappeared. 
As the days passed, the heavens darkened as Richard Stallman lowered from the heavens and promised that Geohot will include a new firmware hack to allow them to use their hidden fan boy dildo feature on their state-of-the-art GNU/Linux operating system.

==How to Use Your PS3==
[[File:Dusty PS3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|What your PS3 should look like.]]
#Insert Blu-Ray disk.(The Ps3 will turn on when you stick your [[cock|disk]] in.)
#Turn on your controller.
#Select the game you would like to play from the XMB.
#Wait for useless game update to download that doesn't even fucking do anything.
#Change the channel to something else, while you wait, preferably something with [[DBZ]] on it.
#Pray the update didn't brick your system.
#Go back to your game and press the start button on your controller to skip the opening cut scene... But wait, your controller is out of batteries, you're gonna go need to plug it in with its [[penis|3 inch]] cord.
#Now that you've finished with that, you can play your game while being constantly interrupted by a message telling you that someone has logged in or out.
#Realize that you're wasting your time.
#Turn off the Ps3.
#Get back to watching [[DBZ]].
#Go on the [[internets]] and torrent every single episode of Drangon Ball Z, and stick it on your Ps3.
#Watch all of them.
#Rinse and repeat.

==The Aftermath==
[[File:Dead PS3.jpg|right|thumb|200px|In the end, it got what it dreamt for]]
After realizing what a shoddy abomination of a game console Sony was making, only the most [[hardcore]] of Sony's horde of [[zombie]] [[fanboy]]s still supported it (see: [[Sony Defense Force]]). Also, game developers decided that it was smarter to take their chances at making games for [[13 year old boys|Xbox 360]] (which was out first) or [[16 year old girls|Wii]] (an overclocked GameCube) than to try and make games for an unstable bucket of random parts that runs on technology that hasn't even been invented yet. Playstation 3 caught the attention of the [[America|US]] [[Government]] when the [[FBI]] discovered that it was the only entity in recent history to lose more support in less time than George Bush Jr.

Also like Dubya, entire communities of losers have coalesced to form cesspools of console [[fanboy]]ism for everything that's not a Sony product. Both these factions are currently preparing to  against their assimilation into the virtual societal simulation that is PlayStation Home.
