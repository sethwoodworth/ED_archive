The '''Port Arthur massacre''' is [[Australia]]'s staged, lame-ass version of [[9/11]], with only 35 people dying, and they actually caught someone doing it.  It has, however, produced [[at least 100|more]] [[conspiracy theories]] than [[9/11]], [[JFK]], the [[Iraq]] wars and Elvis Presley combined, although none of these have made it to [[Shit|reliable fact center]] [[Wikipedia]].  Here is an example of what just one of the 99.9999999999% of websites who disagree with Wikipedia says:

== About Martin Bryant who ASIO says did PA ==
[[Image:Martin Bryant chillin.jpg|thumb|right|275px]]
* [[retard|IQ of 66]], putting him at an impressively low 1.17th percentile. While still able to function independently in society, he received the nickname Stupid Marty.
* Made lewd comments to almost any female. Loved [[pr0n]] and was obsessed with [[bestiality]]. Frequently hired [[Ann Coulter|prostitutes]]. Creepy.
*Enjoyed violent films, his favorite being ''[[Fail|Child's Play II]]''.
* Inherited approximately [[over 9000|$500,000]] after the suicide of his [[an_hero|father]] and the death of Helen Harvey, killed in a convenient car accident '''with Marty in the back seat'''.
* Had no significant firearms experience, but owned 200 teddy bears: further proof that [[furry|furries]] are gun-toting psychopaths in training.
* The Port Arthur Massacre sparked gun reform in Australia, though none was really needed. Tasmania in particular, where this massacre occurred, sported a very low murder rate, in which guns involved only a fraction.
* A New South Wales police report indicates that 29 shots were fired at the Broad Arrow, 19 ending as fatal [[Counterstrike|head shots]], 1 other fatal shot, and 12 wounded. In about 90 seconds. [[Some argue]] that an [[n00b|inexperienced]] [[aspie]] [[Hax|could not fire with such accuracy]], but they are fucking Jew and not to be trusted.
* Bryant's AR-15 was found with an exploded cartridge in the chamber, exploded with a force not normally seen for a bullet of this calibre. If this had occurred while the weapon was being held, [[pwned|severe injury]] would have resulted to the operator - amputation, burns, firearms discharge residue or [[Scientology]]. At time of arrest, Bryant was burned from the fire at Seascape Cottage, but his hands were uninjured.
* Has made four suicide attempts while in prison.  
* Currently enjoying a [[rape|healthy sex life]] at Risdon Prison.
* [[Crazy|Lyndon LaRouche]] publication EIR asserts that Bryant was a "patsy" brainwashed by the Tavistock Institute.

*Police initially reported that there were two gunmen at Seascape.
*The massacre and the shooter had a military appearance. The shooter did 20 head shots in a short time, shooting from the hip - he reloaded his second magazine with one round left.
*The recovered guns were an American AR-15 and a Belgian FN-FAL, both of which had sustained significant, inexplicable damage to barrels, breech, and receiver that rendered them impossible to match with the weapons used in the shooting.
*Witnesses couldn't identify the shooter.
*Jim Laycock, co-owner of the Port Arthur Motel, knew Bryant for 15 years and said it wasn't him.

==Mossad gun-destroying technique==

# Put a [[Cum|Hot Load]] explosive round into the AR-15, which blows up the barrel, bolt, firing pin, extractor, and riflings. This is often used when professionals want to destroy [[ball]]istic evidence.
# Basically you take an [[Goatse|empty cartridge]], take a [[Shit|hotter powder]], and [[Pregnant|fill it to the brim]] (lulz). The cartridge is too much for the gun; it [[1guy1jar|explodes]] and wrecks the mechanisms.
# ??????????
# PROFIT!!1!

Did Bryant have the reloading equipment needed?

Or it could just be that if you leave a loaded gun in a burning house the round inside might explode!?!
