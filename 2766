== How to Spot an Expert ==

Spotting an expert is quite easy. Experts generally carry their forged [[serious business|PhDs]] in their back pocket (in case someone questions them), attend really boring [[orgies|conventions]] and [[lie|tell everyone]] about how super smart they are. An expert will immediately notify you that he or she [[USI|is an expert]], and to [[STFU|shut the fuck up]]. He or she may or may not then [[fail|attempt]] to educate you in their field of [[bullshit|expertise]], even if you didn't ask for help in the first place. They will also advise you not to "try this at home" if they are attempting to do something [[fucktard|really fucking stupid]].

These people are generally very [[douchebag|full of themselves]] and will stop at nothing to maintain a strict form of dignity and intelligence. If you come across an expert, you may use one of many suitable drama-generating techniques:
*Ask them if their "expertise" has ever made them [[profit|money]]
*Continuously ask them "why?" or "how?" (this is more of a delay tactic than a drama tactic)
*Correct them
*Tell them that you can easily do/have done that
*Go off topic
*Mock them
*Point them to their [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] article
