'''Britchan''' was an imageboard for British people who [[like|dislike]] [[Sound Docking|mixing]] with foreigners.  With a userbase composed entirely of [[chavs]] and pretend gentlemen, it eventually crashed and burned in a shitstorm of administrative incompetence and [[Russian|immigrant]] [[CP|invasion]].  In short, it was a perfect reflection of British society.

You people are utter lame. What was done to you to make you this sad and cruel that you would attempt to cause pain to another person in the ways you suggest? Life is about love, and you peeps, you are haters, cowardly haters! 

And it is for this reason that I have now committed myself to the total destruction of britchan. You thought the fetch spam was bad. Ha! That was nothing, I will now spam and d0s you out of total existence for your lameness! 

Paybacks a bitch. Best get ya 1337 hAxors on d case lamz0rz cuz u going down!

[[Image:Moralfag_pretends_to_be_old.png|thumb|Britchan's moralfag troll fails at lulzkilling yet again, this time pretending to be a disapproving oldfag.]]
Unlike better chans, Britchan has been [[up the ass|infested]] with [[batshit insane|misguided]] [[cunt|moralfags]] from it's inception as a discussion space for British [[gay|anti-$cilon]] protests.

<br>

This thin-blood has lead to some unlikely lulz, no less a single bloodminded troll who [[fail|unsuccessfully attempts]] to flood boards with abuse, despite the posting delay between new threads, and also the fact that [[nobody cares]]. 

<br>

The sheer commitment to failing is [[lulz|highly amusing]], with puny, single posts of [[internet tough guy|abuse]] appearing ineffectively at the top of the /i/ board periodically, only to be consumed immediately by more [[Laura Talbot|lulz]].

===[[Operation Jewtube]]===
[[Image:Operation jewtube00111.jpg|thumb]]
[[Image:Omg_pure_winnnnn.png|thumb|"I stayed up for [[OVER 9000|over 36]] HOURS trying to think of ways to stop it in case it was real" And not for one minute did it occur to you that the idea of kids committing suicide at an anti-suicide rally was [[retarded|obviously satire]]?]]

In May 2008, the hideous prospect of [[over 9000]] [[emo]] cutters marching across London in [[lolwut|protest]] against the depiction of the band [[WHEN I WAS|My Chemical Romance]] in the media made Anonymous choke in the privacy of his own damn [[Basement|penthouse]]. Action was needed to tap into this almost endless flow of potential lulz, see [[Operation Jewtube|main article]] for moar.

===Goatse in The Guardian===
[[Image:Goatsee_in_the_guardian.jpg|thumb|right|Those moralfags at enturb have some nerve, [[canadian|eh?]]]]
*'''Goatse in The Guardian'''

On May 20th, 2008, the bleeding-heart liberal [[Guardian]] newspaper ran an article about some faggotry that occurred at the May Scientology raid. Foolishly, the Guardian's [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/may/20/1 on-line version] of the document [[Oh Exploitable!|linked directly]] to an image hosted on Britchan. Lulz ensued.

===Operation Anti-Freeze===

On Wednesday 30th April 2008, at exactly 18:24 GMT, a couple of hundred strangers decided to stand still in London's Liverpool Street Station, despite the fact that the event had been widely advertised and cleared with the authorities, thus reducing any potential subversive impact to that of [[nobody cares|casual curiosity]].

<br>

Luckily for everyone else, Anonymous showed up, loudly invoked [[Rickroll|Astley's Law]], and danced a merry conga through the frozen flashers. 

<br>

Tasteful flyers of Rick Astely being crucified for all our sins were forced into the still hands of the rainy-day subversives, who got quite butthurt about the whole thing. 

<br>

All in all, I'm making a note here: [[Lulz|HUEG SUCCESS]].

===Kerrang Radio Raid===

<del>Britchan were looking for a good and easy radio to troll. Kerrang radio came to mind, and thus the call ins began. Some epic wins were had, although not many, but still some.</del> Britchan piled onto Kerrang after a bunch of moralfags from <del>#london</del> #brumanon went to the Kerrang radio office, failed to get on the show as it was pre-recorded (namely because Chris Wrapson is a spineless twat). Brit Channers then tried and failed to convince the listeners that [[Scientology]] was an evil cult. Many believe that Gary made the best call, which will help demonstrate just how fail their ring-in raid was:

===Pete Price Radio Raid===

Britchan again decide to phone into a radio show this time it was Pete Price the homosexual who has his own phone in show called “Unzipped“, Gary again manages to Bel-Air live on air.

[[Image:Britchan_Pete_Price_Ofcom_Letter.jpg|thumb|Fuckin owned.]]

One Britchan anon reported Pete Price to Ofcom for going "batshit at an Irish troll", a short time before the raids began. His radio station suspended him without pay for a week over the incident, according to a letter the anon got from [[Serious Business|Ofcom]].

===Lake's Closed (Due To Nigras In Pedal Boats)===
[[Image:Lakesclosed.gif|thumb|Yes, they managed an [[IRL]] version of this without getting [[v&]].]]
Some Londonfags tried to perform a swastiget on a lake in Hyde Park [[last Thursday|last Sunday]]. <del>[http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=GyKuTOESRyk This six minute YouTube video]</del> (copyright claim lol wut)  explains it better than any ED [[article]] ever could, sadly. Going on the evidence presented, it was an [[epic win]] for all of those involved. However, since not everyone who uses Britchan lives in the south of England, it's not so easy for those who [[you|live in cities where there is no visible 'Anonymous' activity]], and it means getting to something like this is near-impossible, although this gives the added protection of not being [[facefag]]ged and retaining the ability to laugh at the '[[Nazis|performance artists]]' if it turns out to be an [[epic fail]].

==The Death of Britchan.org==
[[Image:YubYubWordfilter.jpg|thumb|YubYub's technical skills were renowned]]
''tldr YubYub disabled the Great Wall of Britchan and on 5th of February 2009 the Russians dealt [http://lurkmore.ru/Война_имиджборд the deathblow]''
{{squote| 
English Chan britchan.org lifted the ban on entry for non-English IPs. Russian Anonymous couldn't miss such moment, and all the evening and all the night [we spammed the shit out of them]. At the moment at britchan.org is redirection to a page hosting with the inscription "This Account Has Been Suspended. Please contact the billing / support department as soon as possible". Administrator of britchan for the recognition of themselves as British was absolutely useless creature.
Evening orphaned British bitards moved to [[Krautchan]], crying in waistcoats on "Mongol invasion" and administrative powerlessness.

===YubYub's final message===
Once YubYub [[vegetable|woke up]] and realised what had happened, he came over to [http://britfa.gs/iq britfa.gs/iq] for a final goodbye.

{{squote| Hello everyone, [[Facepalm|YubYub]] here again. 

As expected my last thread was full of faggotry and quickly mimicked leaving people confused as to what the original message was. I am here to clear all that up and to shed some light on the future of Britchan. 

As you have all probably guessed Russians Ddos’d Britchan and the bandwidth for the month has been used. It will take until March for Britchan to go up once again but even that is uncertain. I have spoken to R4GE about ownership and he has refused to take back the chan and as I have stated I no longer have time for this chan, that is now even more the case as my girlfriend is now pregnant (no falcon punch, we are both extremely happy about it). Myself and R4GE are both reluctant to hand over the chan to some one we don’t know IRL so we have both agreed that Britchan will never be back. 

There were good times on Britchan that shall never be forgotten, but like all good things they must come to an end. It seems like you have settled in here and I hope that the future of this chan blossoms even further. 

Yours sincerely 

YubYub|}}
