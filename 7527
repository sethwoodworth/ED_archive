'''Sin''' is a term used by [[religious]] [[fanatics]] to describe an act that can be considered to be pleasurable, as pleasure is not allowed in the [[TOS|Religious Fanatics Code of Conduct]]. The code clearly states that pleasure must be accompanied by guilt (this part of the code is strictly adhered to by [[Catholic]]s). Any thought, word, or act which might be considered as pleasurable is deemed to be  "sinful".

== The Seven [[Zomg]] Sins ==

According to the [[Catholic]] tradition, there are seven [[deadly]] sins that, when committed, result in a [[lightning bolt]] being sent straight from [[Heaven]] to burn your fucking labia right out:

===Lust===
Originally [[ABC]] had entitled their hit show ''[[Lost]]'' "Lust", and commissioned a million pound title sequence featuring a [[satan|Black Mass]] in which [[Christian_Spanking_Blogs|Evangelist Lilly]] was penetrated by the ice cold cock of [[John Locke]] to a chorus of fallen angels signing "she'll be coming round the mountain when she comes." Sadly they forgot to back up their hard drive and now instead all we have is a cheap misspelled title made using the 3D Tumbling Text [[Windows]] Screensaver.

===Ennui===
Ennui, which comes from the French for "boring", is condemned by the commandment "Only boring people get bored [[true|verily]] sayeth the Lord". Although we have all met/slept with some very boring people who can be kept entertained for hours by a card with "Please turn over" written on both sides, they don't count, as only people with triple digit IQ's can enter the [[texas|Kingdom of Heaven]].

===Pig fucking===
Although pedophilia is happily embraced by both the Irish [[Catholic]] Church and the Afghani version of  [[Islam]], they both disapprove of human-porcine interspecies lovin' on the grounds that (a) isn't kosher/halal and (b) the intense enjoyment might stop you thinking about Baby Jesus. (That yokel that fucked Ned Beatty in ''Deliverance'' should get by on a technicality though.)

===Doing the gay===
If God had meant us to be gay, he wouldn't have invented [[tits]]. When King [[waco|David]] and Jonathan tried a bit of the gay, God [[pwn|smote]] them mightily and encouraged David to rape Bathsheba and to send her husband on an extentended tour of Helmand Province wearing a placard saying "I'm a Jew." So don't give me any liberal crap about the Bible being misinterpreted, quoting bits of [[Westboro Baptist Church|Leviticus]] concerning not eating out menstruating [[women]]. God hates fucking fags. Get over it.

===Being fat===
Does this really need explaining? (See [[Whale Safe Beer]].)

===Being [[peru|South American]]===
There is a possibility that the [[Internet Law|Jesuits]] accompanying the [[army|Conquistador]] mission to bring hygeine to South America in exchange for [[gold]] made this one up. Although if [[God]] sees everything, he probably spotted [[Mexico]] before the [[Spanish]] did, so anything is possible.

===The seventh Deadly Sin===

Couldn't find this one on [[Wikipedia]], but it probably has to do with feminist anger, penis envy or voting [[Democrat]].

== Lesser Sins == 
[[Image:16candlesaburnin.jpg|thumb|right|Female circumcision is the new blackened snapper]]

Sometimes sins result in a person going to [[Hell|Kenya, where they will undergo the sacred rite of female circumcision]], but only after [[MONGO|due process]]. It's entirely up to [[God]].

Some acts that are considered sinful:

* Drinking [[alcohol]] 
** '''''NOTE:''' Wine is okay but only when a [[Pedophile|priest]] [[anal sex|gives it to you]] 
*** '''''SPECIAL PRIESTLY NOTE:''' Wine is acceptable outside of religious rituals when it is used to get that [[cum|bleachy taste]] out of your mouth''
* Sex before [[marriage]]
** '''''NOTE:''' However, anything that maintains your [[technical virginity]], including [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]], [[anal-oral sex]], etc. are perfectly acceptable''
* Having any type of sexual interaction with a [[man]], even if married (which is also a sin)
** '''''NOTE:''' Boys are still awwwrrriiight''
* Taking part in [[furry]], [[vampyre]], or [[otherkin]] sex -- ever
* [[Masturbation]]
* [[Menstruation]]
* Contracting [[HIV]], even if by a blood transfusion or accidental needlestick

== Dealing With Sin ==

* Carve your [[genitals]] up with a [[razor blade]], unless you enjoy that, which is also a sin
* Look at [[Shock sites|these pages]] and especially [[Offended|this one]] until you feel absolved thereof
