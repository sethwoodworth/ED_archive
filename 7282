SchmuckyTheCat
<strike>'''SchmuckyTheCat''' is the [[God]] of the gaps, and the Creator of the Universe. Specifically, Schmucky created the entire Universe and everything in it [[Last Thursday]]. Schmucky gives the Universe the appearance of age so the skies are not [[black]] but filled with the beautiful light of stars that didn't actually exist Last Thursday but do now. Schmucky created you as you were Last Thursday, intact with all of the memories of what happened before Last Thursday. Whether you actually existed before Last Thursday and Schmucky has just re-created you in this iteration of the Universe is an argument for [[Scientology|theologians]]. Schmucky created all of the physical [[Godwin's law|laws]] (gravity, planks constant, etc) of the Universe so that things would function without his intervention but any where that we as humans fail to grasp those physical laws, Schmucky is there as the explanation. We can always retreat to [[God|faith]] when we [[lol wut|don't understand!]]

Sometimes on the web you will see references to other [[cats]] creating the world on other days. These people are apostates. It was Schmucky, and it was Last Thursday. Some freaks even posit that this current existence is formative delusion and that their deity is going to create the world Next Monday. Even more bizarre are claims about some [[God|generic "God"]] that isn't even worth a name creating the world [[Over 9000|over 9000]] years ago. Who cares about 9001 years ago, obviously faith requires something recent thus the blatant truth of Last Thursdayism.</strike>

==How to make him mad==
[[Image:How_much_a_furry.jpg|thumb|right|He explains why he's not a furry.]]
SchmuckyTheCat is not a furry at all.  If he were, he would have a fursona on his wikipedia page that would be an anthropomorphic cat, and it would be wearing glasses, and it would have a dozen penises, and multiple vaginas and anuses, and the rest of the body would be feminine shape with huge breasts, except for the head which would be male.  Then he would draw a lot of [[vore]] "art" mixed with scat.  [[:Image:Holychristfurfags.jpg|That's what furries do!]]

But it's common knowledge that even suggesting SchmuckyTheCat is a [[furry]] makes him [[Kirbyraeg|rage]].  [[anger|This seems to result in him being called it a lot.]]

But seriously, wouldn't even [[you]] be pissed off to be called a furry?  There is no greater insult!  Of all the insults that piss people off, furry is the worst.  Is [[Nazi]] worse?  Nope!  Fat?  Nope!  Virgin?  Nope!  [[Pedophile]]?  Okay maybe this, but then a lot of furries are [[babyfur]]s making them also pedophiles.

==Wiki Battles==

===Fight with Ryulong on Wikipedia===

SchmuckyTheFurry picks a fight [[Ryulong]] on [[TOW]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SchmuckyTheCat&oldid=192282851#Signing]  As you may know, Ryulong is [[the cancer that is killing /b/|the cancer that is killing TOW]] and deserved to be taunted.

After six months of Ryulong being pissed about it, eventually Schmucky's omissions of timestamps in signatures caused drama on the administrator noticeboard.

=== Fight with Sceptre ===
For years, [[Sceptre]] abused rollback and people who complained about his abuse were usually banned.  The people cried out for [[an hero]] to stop him!  On August 6, 2008, SchmuckyTheCat accepted the challenge.  Aided only by the advice of Deckard Cain, he battled [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez&action=history] Sceptre who [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Criticism_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_(2nd_nomination) lost] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=User%3ASceptre&year=&month=-1 lost big], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=User%3ASceptre&year=&month=-1 with his rollback taken away].
