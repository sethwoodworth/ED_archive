'''Ty the Fox''', aka Tyler Thomas, is your average [[Infantilism|diaper-shitting]] [[babyfur]] and wannabe [[hacker]] from South Carolina. He spends his time looking after his [[Sad|online family]], which consists of other babyfurs at the same level of [[sick fuck]]ery as him. He believes that he is [[Computer Science III|good at computers]], shown by his ability to [[lie|keep his accounts and information safe]].

Being a babyfur, Tyler [[what|believes he is 2 years old]]. He is also the owner of the Babyfur group on Steam, which are known to continuously terrorize crappy [[Valve]] games such as ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' by spraying their diaper-shitting fursonas fucking everywhere. His shitty art makes everyone else who looks at it want to [[an hero|kill themselves]], since art of a tiger cub pissing itself is [[awright|not hot]].

Tyler claims to hate ''[[4chan]] and all it's inhabitants'', according to a deleted FA journal, proving that Tyler is probably butthurt from when 4chan raped him in the ass before. He also probably believes the only board on 4chan is [[b/|/b/]], like the many other butthurt [[furfag]]s who get trolled along with sick fucks like Tyler himself. Ironically he claims to be a good hacker, although has had his own accounts hacked into at least three times before. If you "hack" him however, he'll be sure to [[bawww|contact your local police]], even though he has [[Hurr|no idea where you live]]. Also, he does things "for the [[fail|lolz]]".

Oh, did we forget to mention he is a [[zoophile]] too?

==Tyler's Circlejerk==
[[Image:DisregardthatIgothackedagain.JPG|right|thumb|Then change your password, [[fucktard]].]]
Since Tyler has no real family [[IRL]] since he got [[pwnt|disowned]] after they found out he was [[gay]], Tyler got adopted in some furpile family with other babyfurs or something like that. Soon, Tyler's online family had a divorce due to furry [[drama]], so he took his "fur daddy" as his boyfriend, proving that Tyler is into [[incest]]. Even though this is all simply furry [[yiff]] roleplay, he's actually making something out of the fact that he typefucks over the internet, and actually considers his [[loser|online boyfriend]] seriously. Even though this has happened, he ''still'' has 10 other babyfur "brothers" in his furfag circlejerk, whom he probably yiffs with in huge [[sex|furpiles]] daily. In fact, he's even wrote sexual fiction with these people. All in all, Tyler's online family is just his personal hugbox. In case he gets pwnt somehow, either in real life or on the internets, he will immediately return to his circlejerk to bawww.

|Well, after knowing my fur daddies Milo and Rask for about 5 months, Rask betrayed Milo and they broke up. I was devastated at first, but I had been with Milo since the very beginning of our RP "family", obviously being the baby son, and I was determined to stay with him. So, now I'm with my loving, cute, adorable boyfriend [[Pedophile|Milo]]. May our relationship be everlasting.|[http://www.myfursona.com/user/TytheFox Tyler]
|It's my first time being completely ravaged like this. I've been harassed and stalked before, called names and insulted, but nothing that hit me at the core like this.

|I don't have many RL friends, those I do have I see very infrequently and they don't all understand me. But [[Hugbox|you guys I feel at home with]], relaxed and happy.

|He trolled a babyfur with virtually [[poor|no money]] and a [[lie|logical mind]]. Whoop-de-fuckin-doo|Tyler
|So while he thinks that I'm taking this seriously, it's a game to me as well.|The day before this, he was preparing to commit "digital suicide" and even asked his dad for more diapers.
|you saved me from basically digital suicide. Thank you.|Told you.

Even [[moar]]: After raping his email archives, it was discovered that Tyler was [[Nuzzlefuzzle|Karadroth]]'s asskisser back in the day. What a surprise. Other than that, Karadroth had some part in Tyler's family at one point, with Tyler asking him if Milo could be his "fur daddy". He is also good friends with [[Zareth]].

==Tyler's Email==
[[image:Tyshotweb.jpg|thumb|right|Enough said]]
Recently Tyler's email was successfully haxored into and his [[dox]] scraped from an order for [[Wtf|adult-size diapers]], which he uses to shit into, unlike the average person. Later his older account was hacked, revealing he had an account on [[Bestiality|Zetaforum]], adding to his pile of sickfuckery. Being the fucktard he is, Tyler leaves '''every fucking email containing bank information''' in a folder, but due to [[Trolls Remorse]], this was left alone (that and because he was a poorfag anyway).

==Tyler's Fiction and RP faggotry==

{{quote|Ty the Fox {BFG} reaches around, looking for something - "My [[Paki|paci]].... Iunno where it wents, but yuh,  we can be each others' pacis!" *giggles and kisses your forehead and leans back, his crotch wide open for sucklage*|[[What]]}}

The following chapter of a story Tyler wrote was leaked from his emails. Chapter one was fucking boring and was full of [[lies]], such as Tyler being portrayed as a [[Unrealistic Expectations|good hacker]]. They also try to break into some secret corporation just to steal a [[PS3|games console]] because they're too poor to afford one. Thankfully the [[Cops]] come along and arrest them both. This is an extract of an email he sent to ''chaos_rings_kangaroo@hotmail.com'', aka [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/blooroo/ blooroo]:

''Ty and Kai, almost as if on cue, both pressed their bellies, pressing around as they felt pressure from their bladder.  “Let’s open that box now.” Said Ty nervously.  With a nod, Kai brought the box down onto the floor and they opened it up.  Inside were several bags, not marked except for a few numbers on the package, labeled “Teen – 32 to 48” and other sequences of numbers.  Opening the bags, the boys discovered that they were given diapers.  Ty and Kai glanced at each other nervously.   Ty and Kai had a taboo secret that only they told each other about.  That was that they had a desire to wear diapers.  Ty had already taken his pants off, then his boxers. Blushing, Ty sat stark naked in front of Kai.  Kai smiled and took his own clothes off to reassure Ty that things were fine.  After seeing each other naked, Ty’s sheath began to firm up, as did Kai’s.  They sat for a moment, just staring at each other’s sheaths, when Ty blushed.  “You know, one way or another we’re gonna get yiffy here.” Ty stated logically.  Nodding, Kai laid on his back.  Ty lifted his legs and placed an unfolded diaper under him, when Kai’s tip began to peek out of his sheath.''

==Tyler's FurAffinity==
[[image:TythefoxTCG.jpg|thumb|right|Furries put people off trading card games.]]
[[image:Bitchesdontknowmypassword.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bitches don't know]]]]
Somebody decided it would be [[lulz]]y to [[hack]] into Tyler's FailAffinity and proceed to [[delete fucking everything]]. So he did, resulting in a bunch of [[bawww]]ing furfags in group chats everywhere. The person who did it claimed to be [[Zareth]] itself, though this is probably a lie.

[[Image:TyBitchesbehatin.png|thumb|600px|center|YO YO YO]]

This [[1337]] [[h4x0r]]ing spree resulted in making Tyler's friends rage. An admin stepped in a short time later, and obviously couldn't be bothered to deal with this mess, thus closed the account. Later, the account was reopened and Tyler's dox [[anti-lulz|removed]] from the profile info.

==Tyler on ED==
[[image:TyMysterybot.PNG|center]]

After seeing this article, Tyler or his friends tried to spread [[lies]] via [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Ty_the_Fox&diff=1998416598&oldid=1998416577 editing it], claiming that his email address wasn't used anymore or simply just deleting fucking everything.

==Tyler on Steam==
[[Image:TypicalBabyfurDiscussion.PNG|thumb|right|Not only do they wear diapers, they bitch about the colours too, even though they almost always turn brown.]]
{{Quote|There was another guy named Ty the Fox, he sounds like 30ish on the microphone, and started [[Ejaculation|spraying]] graffiti of his fursona everywhere. Normaly, if its a normal picture, [[Closet furry|its cool and all]], but for atleast an hour or so, I had to stare at this baby red fox shitting in his diaper [[DO NOT WANT|UGHH]].|[http://sexy-mallard.livejournal.com/18645.html Some blogger on Tyler]}}
Tyler operates the Babyfur steam group, which is normally filled with announcements like "I WANT THIS FUCKING DIAPER!!!1!" or "THIS GUY IS TROLLING US! REPORT HIS STEAM PAGE!!1111". The group is partially closed due to trolls, meaning you have to be invited into the group if you really wanted to talk to a bunch of [[basement dwelling]] diaper-shitting fucktards. Whilst high and frantically changing his passwords to avoid [[Mike Sandy|hackers]], Tyler accidentallied his password because he forgot what it was. Not to worry, he went and sent a support request, who are currently replying back to his email account, the one that's been hacked numerous times.

The anticheat on ''Global Agenda'' also pwnt him, banning his account from the game because he was up to his [[1337]] [[h4x0r]] skills again. On the subject of MMOs like ''Global Agenda'', Tyler already claimed to [[Hypocrite|hate MMOs]] in his Steam profile.

===What's a Furry?===
[[image:TylerGoodriddance.png|thumb|right|Good Riddance.]]
Tyler also owns a [[Left 4 Dead 2]] server known as What's a Furry? which is only used when Tyler bitches at his friends to go play on said server. Otherwise it remains unused. The server is located at 69.31.134.94:27015.

Recently the server was hacked into and the server files deleted for [[lulz]].

==Tyler's Cousins==
[[Image:TheBakers.jpg|thumb|left|The Baker family irl, proud of the fact that they aren't raising a furfag]]
[[Image:JordanBaker.jpg|thumb|right|Jordan Baker, saving a puppy from getting into the hands of Ty]]
It appears that Tyler has cousins known as the Bakers, whom adopt chinks to save them from something or whatever. The Bakers are very fond [[Christians]] and run a boring web 1.0 website in which they post their biographies. Undeniably they are fucking amazing compared to the Thomas family, which has only a furfag, a drug-addicted father and girls still using [[Facebook]]. This is also moar proof that furries ruin lives, since the Baker family are obviously [[high|happy]] that they live nowhere fucking near Tyler.

The Bakers have adopted four chinks in total, all [[Sweatshop|leading completely happy lives]].

==Tyler's MyFursona==
Tyler's [[Fail|MyFursona]] account was also hacked into seeing Tyler uses the [[moron|same password for everything]].

'''''BREAKING NEWS!@!@!''''': Tyler is a [[scientologist]] and proud.

<center>[[Image:TyMyFursona.JPG]]</center>

And that, [[gentlemen]], is why you secure your password when on the internets. Since Ty is the typical [[fucktard]], he still doesn't, which is strange since babyfurs are the most lulzworthy targets on the internet.

==Dox==
In case you missed the diaper delivery e-mail, Tyler lives at '''310 Sugar Creek Crossing, Fort Mill, South Carolina, US''' and his postal code is '''29715'''.

Oh, and be sure to phone him on '''(803) 802-5182''', '''(803)802-5781''' or '''(803) 431-9275'''. Or even, you can call his mom on '''803 431-3105'''.

Since this article, Tyler has claimed to want to create a new identity on the internets. Obviously, that's not going to happen. Also it's apparent that he hides his diaper faggotry from his sisters.
