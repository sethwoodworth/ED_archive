[[Image:Mike11.jpg|thumb|right|Kaputsky IRL: 18 year-old Mike Casto.]]
'''Kaputsky''' (a.k.a. ''Mikau'') is your typical, fun-loving [[Pikaman|Pichu]], who makes it very clear by making a profile description that's [[Kawaii|TOTALLY KAWAII!!!! =^.^=]] As many [[FurAffinity]] [[faggots]] do, he makes an [[lie|honest]] living requesting free art and BEGGING to be on people's friends list. Even though he's a Pichu fetishist, he refuses to acknowledge the fact that Pichu is indeed a baby Pokémon, therefore making him a pedophile. He currently resides in North East, Maryland, USA. His cell phone number is 302-757-2470, drop him a line or text him sometime!

In his spare time, Kaputsky enjoys browsing [[Furaffinity]], asking complete strangers to draw art for him (and blocking them if they refuse), and making cute emoticons to use in chat and IM. Above all, however, his favorite activity is hunting down every possible group of friends listed on other people's profiles or journal headers/footers, and sucking dick to be on it. However, the victim actually needs to fucking like him if they were to consider him a friend (and they don't).


Sometimes, he'll even go as far as asking people who are already in the friends list to refer them, and to put in a good word. The stupider furfags say "Umm... Sure, why not?" and add him. Why does he do this? To increase his popularity on the site, because the clever Pichu realized that the more people see his shit-eating grin on Furaffinity, [[Internet_celebrity|the more pageviews he shall obtain.]]

Oh yeah, did we mention he is also a [[racist|racist]] [[idiot|idiot?]] Mike often insults others based on their race or even just their damn location whenever he gets the chance while [[rage|raeging,]] thinking they always make good comebacks (which just makes him more stupid in the process). Even when he isn't being a tardraging dumbass, he still assumes politically incorrect shit of others, even during harmless IM chats.









== Pedophilia ==
[[Image:Mikecasto.jpg|thumb|right|Mike, denying what he does and loves best.]] 

Due to the fact that Mike enjoys raping [[Babies|Pichu]] in his free time, [[Fact|it makes him a pedophile.]] He denies it, saying that Pichu isn't a baby, and how he's [[lie|"NOT into that shit."]] But everyone knows it's a simple cover so that he can continue fucking them unhampered. He even acts like a baby when he's with his "Daddy;" a fat, dog fucking, incestuous black and blue Raichu named Kaji.

Easy trolling? Go and ask him how he can possibly be even aroused by a baby. Explain to him that Pichu must be a baby, because he is a predecessor to Pikachu. Even Pichu's Pokedex information indicates it's not fully grown, and is a baby.  

{{quote|The electric pouches on its cheeks are still small. They cannot store much electricity yet.|Taken straight from the Pokémon Diamond Pokedex, proof that Mike is a pedophile. Other Pokedex entries indicate more or less the same thing.}}

Here's to hoping that [[sickfuck|baby-fucker]] gets arrested soon. It'll certainly make both the world and the Poke-World a safer place, for babies and Pichu alike.

== Relationships ==
[[Image:1249632316.pichu90 ihsmankaputsky.png|thumb|left|Kaputsky doing what he does best. "I-I'll be on your friends list after, r-right?"]]
[[Image:Mike2.jpg|thumb|right|Mike Casto posing, the snazzy guy. <3]]
Over the course of the 2 years he's been on FA, he's had at least [[over 9000]] relationships. Whenever he doesn't have a mate (which is hardly ever), he stresses the fact that he isn't currently in a relationship by setting his current mood to "[[lonely]]" and acting all embarrassed and flirty to everybody he talks to, even to complete strangers.

===List Of Relationships===
[[Image:PMs_from_Mike.PNG‎|thumb|right|Mike, taking the cock-blocking maturely.]]
This list isn't complete, not even close, mostly because hardly anybody can even keep track of how many internet relationships he goes through a day. More will be added soon.

*{{furaffinity|pichupal|pichupal}} -- "OMG SOMEBODY WHO SHARES MY TOTALLY KAWAII OPINION ON PICHU!!!!!11!" This one didn't last long either. Also, Mike keeps sending this furfag hate PMs like some stalker or secret admirer, [[coward|all while keeping him blocked so he can't respond.]] Why? Because he was butthurt over the fact that pichupal got to somebody else first and started [[BAWW|bawwing]] like a bitch. Today, he continues this, with much lulz provided in every new message.

*{{furaffinity|arcynine|arcynine}} -- Some [[13 year old boy|13 year old]] kid Kaputsky asked out. Once he found out he lived all the way out in [[Europe]], the relationship began to slowly deteriorate. 

*{{furaffinity|bloodclaw|bloodclaw}} -- Kaputsky decided to get together with Bloodclaw. The next day, he broke up with him because he found out that he had a [[sick fuck|fart fetish]]. It just comes to show how little he knows about people when he asks them to be his boyfriend.

*{{furaffinity|luckydefox|Isaac Cooney}} -- Mike's most recent [[Dane Cook|relationshit.]] At the tender age of 16, he's already the definition of "Furfag", tending to wear a tail at school and around his parents. When asked why he does so, he happily declares that he's a furry, something we're all quite sure that his parents are proud of. He lives in Harford, MD, only a little ways away from the recently-turned-18 Michael Casto. Shortly after the addition of his newest relationship on this article, Isaac decided he didn't like the stressful conditions he was being put under. He broke up with Mike soon after.  Total elapsed time? Roughly 4 days, a new record!

[[Image:Kaputskyfail.PNG|thumb|right|Unable to take rejection well, Mike sucks up to everyone who told *{{furaffinity|luckydefox|Isaac Cooney}} off during their whole 4 day relationship assuming this will alleviate his humiliation.]]

{{quote|FWD: With all this drama and ppl attacking me. I don't like getting so stressed. this is the most stressed out i've been in awhile. i don't want to be in a stressful relationship. i'm sorry. /-/ ¿ Lucky ¿ /-/|Isaac making the right decision, staying far away from Mike and his immature antics.}}

*{{furaffinity|slashthehedgie|slashthehedgie}} -- Mike's attention whoring, fat fuck of a father, who happens to love [[Dracoguard|dog cock]], [[Incest|incest]], and [[Pedophilia|pedophilia]] as much as he does. His purpose is to satisfy Mike's urges for some [[Black|niggerchu]] action on his little, Pichu anus.


== Emoticons ==

Kaputsky seems to be quite the little inventor of text emotes, each one some incoherent mess that takes anybody who looks at them about 10 seconds to realize what it's supposed to represent. He uses these emotes everywhere. Such emotes consist of the following:

* '///';  
* T.//////.T; 
* ._._.; 
* './////.' 
* :1 
* >//ω//< 
* -3- 
* -w- 
* >3<
* V~V;
* :#< 
* -//.\\-;
* '^'
* >o<
* ;~;
* /w\;

==Advice Mike==
[[Image:Emailspamming.png|thumb|right|Kaputsky and his retarded friends try to retaliate when a link to this page is sent to him.]]
Some victims of his online faggotry rebelled and began making Advice Mikes. Here are all of the known ones.

[[Image:Plz can we be friends.png|thumb|right|Kaputsky seen apologizing for bashing a straight furry. The victim had placed a note on his profile stating that he couldn't respond to him because Mike still had him blocked, but, fearing for his valuable reputation, he chose to apologize.]]

==Paw Lovin Goodness==
Kaputsky makes it extremely obvious that he's a dirty little [[Pawfur|Pawslut]] as well. If he's not begging for [[shit|furry art]], he's out [[Masturbating|pawing off]] to some smelly paws.

Casto, the footslut that he is, released pictures of his perfect feet. Here they are, archived forever.
