'''Darren Reed''' is the gent who [http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/ wrote IPFilter], the wonderful program that allows your [[Solaris]] machine to work as a NAT router and Zones, a way to keep your [[Satanism|daemons]] safe from [[hackers]]. 

He's also known for fighting with [[Theo de Raadt]] over something as inane as his license not allowing for OpenBSD to modify without authorization, and redistribute at will, thus sending Theo off the handle. Theo subsequently removed IPF, with no other tool available in its stead, and Darren had to [http://web.archive.org/web/20020528060935/openbsd30.ipfilter.org/ create his own OpenBSD with IPF distribution].)

Darren Reed also [http://www.kumpu.org/cv.pdf co-wrote] the [[IRC]] protocol with some [[Finnish]] sperg.

Has been known to get severely [[beer|inebriated]] at USENIX Security Symposiums, and attempt [[sex|the horizontal mambo]] with [[l0pht]]'s mudge.
