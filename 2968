'''Firithfenion''' (or "'''Andreas'''") is an [[internet tough guy]] from [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] who [[fail|attempts]] to [[white knight|uphold the 'honor']] of [[JewTube]] user [[MRirian]] [[obsession|at any and all costs]]. He believes that JewTube is his only path of connection with MRirian, as the jews have infested his [[Nazi|German]] brain. Believing he can come to ED to stop [[trolls]] in their tracks and force them to experience [[troll's remorse]], Firithfenion is also among the top 5 most wanted [[pedophile|Magiphiles]] on the [[internet]]s.  

==Journey to ED==
[[Image:MagiDental.jpg|thumb|right|Believe it or not, THIS is What Firithfenion Fights For...'''TEEFS'''!]]
It all started when an [[EDiot]] and [[failed]] [[troll]] by the name of [[User:Arguecat3|Arguecat3]] decided the [[MRirian]] ED article needed a little spicing up, so she traveled on over to [[Wikipedia]] where Firithfenion had created an article to try and counteract the 'negative' one at ED. Although the small amount of failed vandalism of the [[Wikipedia]] were reverted by [[Wikipedo]] Mods, Arguecat3 at least succeeded in pissing off Firithfenion to the point where he felt he needed to come on over to ED to "keep the trolls in check", but has thus far [[fail]]ed quite hard. Lulz.  

Upon his entrance to ED, he immediately became involved in an edit war with everyone on the fucking planet over his userpage (effectively fucking his intentions to get involved in an [[edit war]] over the [[Magibon]] article right in the ass).  In reality, even the most basic ED user could have guessed what was going on simply by watching the [[recent changes]] page and joined in on the lulz (as many did).  Soon, the lulz were switching between his user and talk pages, and Firith found himself overwhelmed by all the people he recommended psychiatry to.  

At some point, he decided it would be a good idea to argue in different languages so as to deemphasize his shitty grasp on the English language.  However, it was not his weak grasp on the English language that made him a [[lolcow]].  Rather, it was his almost non-existent grasp on logic and debate (see also:  muscle suit, old freaking stalker and [[white knight]]).  By the end of it all, trolls from all over the spectrum of intelligence were [[raep|having their way with him]].

==Firithfenion's "[[Fail|Accomplishments]]"==
[[Image:Firithfenion Goatse (-40 contrast).png|thumb|right|Firithfenion's [[Goatse|Other passion]] besides Magibon, and what many believe he wishes to do to her.]]

===Magibon Wikipedia Article===

FirithFenion was an editor of the wikipedia Magibon. During his tenure of editing, the Magibon article becames so fanboyish, that it attracted the eye of other wikipedos, and it wasn't before long the article was ridiculed with NPOV tags. Much drama were had as Firithfenion slowly lost his iron grip over the article. Butthurt over it he [[rape spider]]ed the [http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/User:Hetelllies nut case whom he believed responsible]. The funny ghey part of it, is that even to this day, Andreas fucking denies it.

===MRirian 'Official' Fangroup===

As if writing the [[Wikipedo]] article on a [[MRirian|weeaboo camwhore]] was not already enough faggotry to deal with, Firithfenion outdid himself by founding the [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mririan_fangroup/ Yahoo Mririan fangroup] as well. As expected, this particular group has been declared 'official'... or so they claim.

===Magibon FAQ===

Firithfenion's [[shit|greatest accomplishment]] is a FAQ he wrote about Magibon in order to try and 'clear up false information' and answer other questions that people may have about her. In this FAQ, he shows a strong disliking of ED, and tries to play down everything that is written in the ED article about her. 
[[Image:Proof he hates ED.JPG]]
{{clear}}
Alas, he also steals ideas from the ED MRirian Talkpage! He copied the idea of writing about what Magibon did in Japan; it looks as if it is just a summary of what is written on the aforementioned Talkpage.

==Trolls who have contributed in the trolling of this Massive [[Lolcow]]==
[[Image:Firithfenion.jpg|thumb|right|How Firithfenion deals with <s>jews</s> [[trolls]].]]
*'''Annonbacca''' (Pioneer troll. Not much information is known on him. If anyone knows if he is actually an ED user, please help in finding him.)
*[[User:Arguecat3|Arguefag3]] (Article writer, vandalizer of Wiki page that brought Firith to our door. She lovingly received first homosexual nickname  from Firith despite being [[No girls on the internet|a girl]], and was the first to receive advice from him about seeking mental help.)
*[[User:Campus101|Campus101]](Co-author of the MRirian article.)
*[[User:CrakHoar|CroakHoar/CrokHoar]] (Author of Firithfenion [[Bel-Air]], receiver of 5th and 6th nicknames.)
*[[User:DCY|DCY]] (Sysop who was kind enough to not B& [[lolcow|Firith]] upon request so lulz could be milked, and also kindly allowed this article to be published.)
*[[User:ElStormo|Elhomo]] ([[Winrar|Winner]] of the second homosexual nickname from Firith. Contributor of [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:MagiDental.jpg Graveyard TEEFS photos] of Magibon to piss off Firithfenion.)
*[[User:Fdl|Fdl]] (Firithfenion page reverter.)
*[[User:FukkenTroll|FukkenTroll]] (Contributor of 50 [[Meatspin]] to Firith userpage.)
*[[User:Hagger?|Hagger]] (Vandalizer of Firithfenion ED Userpage in the Wikipedia template vandalism manner, co-reverter.)
*[[User:Serious Cat|Stupid Cat]] (Intrepid user of the [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:MagiDental.jpg Graveyard TEEFS photos] of Magibon to piss off Firithfenion. He too, had the [[Lol|honor]] of getting advice to seek psychiatric help from Firith, and also received a nickname.)
*[[User:Sgt. Cowboy|Sgt. Crowboy]] (Apparently Firithfenion's favorite troll, demanded nickname as well from Firith and was dubbed with a failed prototype nickname. Apparently, he was running out of ideas for latently homosexual nicknames.)
*[[User:Siriusblack|Siriusblack]] (Co-reverter of Firith userpage, giver of [[advice dog|advice]] to Firith.)
{{clear}}

==[[Delete Fucking Everything]]==
Since Firithfenion has a bad habit of deleting anything and everything on his ED user talkpage, it shall all be archived [[User talk:Firithfenion/Archive|here]].

==You've been had, ED!==
When trolling gradually subsided, Firithfenion sprung his [[Trap|devious trap]] - his lolcow behaviour was not, in fact, inspired by a pedophilic obsession for Magibon, no, it was a ''psychological experiment''! Firithfenion revealed his true self: behind the façade of the dirty old pervert was the cunning deviousness of the Internet psychologist. [[DivineAngel|ED fell into his trap]]! Arguecat3 and consorts gasped in horror as their psyches were mercilessly dissected and laid in front of their disembodied eyeballs. [[Inane flame|Firithfenion's findings]] were perplexing:


* [[User:Arguecat3|Arguecat]] needs a psychiatrist. And [[Jenkem|medication]].
* [[Unwarranted self-importance|The hatred of a jealous and bad girl created him]], Arguecat's [[Lolcow|antithesis]]
* Alcoholics and junkies prefer to stay in their black person and so do many EDitors
* If you can't stand the heat, stay away from the kitchen
* [[User:ElStormo|El Stormo]] is actually El Homo
* A lot of ED authors have a [[Rape|sympathy]] for Magi, even if they don't like to admit it openly
* Luke Skywalker went into the Death Star but this didn't make him a part of the Dark Side of the Force


Needless to say, all brave EDiots participating in the Firithfenion massacre were down for the count, so cunningly entrapped, and they were at Firithfenion's mercy. His [[Fail|victory]] was complete. Stick that in your pipe and smoke it, ED!

'''The main reason why I am here is [[Dubious disclaimer|NOT]] the shameful ED article about Magibon. I still see this article as stupid, shameful, mean and disgusting, but [[Not gay|this is not the reason why I am here]]. In fact, I ignored ED for a certain time and in the first time I did not even mention ED on the Magibon FAQ. However, some people like Arguecat3 started to show signs of megalomania. She did not stay [[Kitchen|in her place]] with this shitty article, she started to cross the Rubikon. She [[Winrar|vandalized Wikipedia]] (I have documented this incident with screenshots and links) and she tried to invade our peaceful Magibon [[Hivemind|fangroup]]. This forced me to take some action to keep people like her at bay. I found out a lot of other interesting things, but so far I was generous enough to keep them as my secret. This account was created to talk with each other. If I had other intentions, I probably would not have chosen this nickname.'''

===Sources Firith Has Referenced===

Firith has been known to reference many high-brow sources.  Some of the following quotes were very slightly altered for clarity (unless Firith fucking the English language was the funny part):

A great way if u r looking for a nickname which isn't already in use.|Firith referencing "Lord of the Rings".}}
{{squote|Oh, interesting idea! The article looks promising! Hm.. maybe you are right and I should contribute. However, it sounds to me a bit like the imperator tries to convince Luke Skywalker to come to the dark side of the force. You remember that the imperator failed?|Firith referencing the George W. Bush redub of "Star Wars".}}
{{squote|No, it is not sad that I expanded the 'Arguecat' article that you created. Luke Skywalker went into the death-star but this didn't make him a part of the dark side of the force.|Firith referencing "Star Wars" again, this time in complete contrast to his first argument against working on an article making fun of Arguecat3.}}
{{squote|a fitting quote: Of course we must fear evil men, but there is another evil that we must fear more and that is the indifference of good men.|Firith referencing "Boondock Saints" to describe a troll sympathizer.}}
{{squote|However, remember what Sly said in Rocky I to a girl (I quote from memory): 'If you hang around with smart people, you'll get smart friends, but if you hang around with yo-yo people, you'll get only yo-yo friends. Keep this in mind Argue.|Firith never ending his quote as he references the philosophical gold that is "Rocky".}}
{{squote|A wise man once gave her this advice: 'If you hang around with nice people, you'll get nice friends, if you hang around with smart people you'll get smart friends but if you hang around with yo-yo people, you'll get yo-yo friends.' The latter was exactly what happened to Arguecat.|Firith referencing himself referencing Rocky, and getting completely lost in simulacrum.}}
{{squote|Leontes te devorant.|Firith incorrectly referencing "Asterix and Obelix" (cartoon <s>vikings</s> Gauls).  This is a corruption of the phrase, "Leones te devorant," which means, "The lions devour you."}}
{{squote|As the German philosopher Hegel once said, every thesis provokes an antithesis and he called this stuff dialectic. Well, he was right. The hatred of a jealous and bad girl created me, the antithesis of Arguecats stupid hatred.|Firith finally referencing something of value while throwing in a little [[unwarranted self importance]].  It should also be noted that [[User:Arguecat3|Arguecat3]] is intelligent and this makes sense.}}

===Advice from Firithfenion===

'''Arguecat, [[Irony|you really need a shrink]].'''
|Firithfenion, failing at giving advice.}}
{{squote|
'''You need a psychiatrist. You have a lot of complexes and issues, Stupidcat.'''

{{squote|
'''If you don't know the difference between slander, vandalism, stalking and satire, you're probably not the right person to give other people any kind of advice.'''
