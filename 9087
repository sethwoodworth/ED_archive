WinMX
'''WinMX''' is a now-defunct p2p client which was [[pwned]] by the [[RIAA]] in 2005.
The raid by RIAA was perfectly orchestrated. Tons of fake files were placed on the servers with file sizes and names closely resembling real files. Then they arrested some Japanese professors who ran the client.
