'''F5''' is the key that you mash on your keyboard to refresh the page until the letters are probably rubbed off or covered in [[chicken]] grease.


==Felony?==
In Akron, Ohio a [[13 year old boy]] was charged with a [[internet jail|felony]] for creating a [[website]] which linked to his [[school]]'s page asking people to hit F5 repeatedly to crash the school's server. Any [[idiot]] would know that all this would do is slow down the site, but not the Akron police.

==Variations==
CTRL+F5
SHIFT+CTRL+R

It could also be used in a [[Powerpoint presentation|Powerpoint]] to View Show. This is F5 in its larval, benign stage.

==People who use F5==
*You ( meaning the fat couch surfing lazy bastard who sits there watching TV with a laptop open cycling between your [[LJ]] [[Friends list|Friends]] list) 
*The [[Adult Swim]] forums
*The [[craigslist]] personals while eating [[chicken]] wings.
*Those who watch over [[Recent Changes]] 24/7 ready to revert edits for butthurt reasons
