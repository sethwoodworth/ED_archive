At first I was like X, but then I was like Y
[[Image:At_first_but_then_fragged.jpeg|right|thumb|Fighting for freedom :D]]
'''At first I was like X, but then I was like Y''' is a [[meme]] that first appeared [[at least 100 years ago|way back in 2004]]. As usual, this [[Dane_Cook|sad excuse for humor]] was deemed [[shit]] by the [[Internet|interbutts]] and then [[GTFO|flushed down the toilet with the rest of the turds]].

==Proper Execution==

This meme is so simple in usage that even [[you]] could do it. Of course, you shouldn't, because it is one of the worst forced, forgotten memes of the century.

Should you be feeling nostalgic, or like a [[Ferrari Guy|douchebag]], feel free to [[fail|force this meme once again]] by using the following steps:

#Take a screencap or picture of someone with one expression and/or superimpose "At first I was like Y,".
#Insert the words "But Then..." at the bottom of the first picture.
#Take a screencap or picture of that same person with a different expression and/or superimpose "But then I was like X."
#[[raep|Be brutally beaten]] for [[faggotry|forcing a shitty meme]].
#???
#PROFIT!!!

==Usage Situations==
[[Image:AtFirstMudkipz.jpg‎|right|thumb|Other memes can be incorporated into this particular meme.]]
[[Image:1staenowwp.png|right|thumb|Oh, [http://whatport80.com/ I see] what you did there. [[LOL|What a great website!]].]]

Unfortunately, this [[meme]] is typically used in response to something, generally [[Imma_Let_You_Finish|when someone corrects themselves or somebody else]], or provides some sort of [[blowjob|relief]] to the topic. 

An instance of situation:

'''moot: 4chan is closing its website...'''<br>
'''moot: because we're moving to a new hosting server.'''

Notice how your [[erection|emotions rose]] when you heard that your [[Divide by zero|life may be shutdown forever]], but was then quickly relieved by [[bullshit|moot's life-saving capabilities]].
