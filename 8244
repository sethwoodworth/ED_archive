Perhaps the [[lulz]]iest documentary ever, and [[fact|100% medically accurate]], '''The Human Centipede''' [[pun|redefines]] the phrases [[ass to mouth]] and [[intelligent design]]. This is perhaps the most blogged about B-Movie since [[Snakes on a Plane]]. 

Making money by generating controversy, the movie industry outdo themselves once again. It is unknown if the critics claiming to hate this movie are actually that stupid when telling their audience to completely avoid the movie, or if they're part of a larger scheme, turning controversy generation into an exact science.

This sure-to-be Oscar winning documentary comes to us via the husband and wife team of [[sick fuck]]s Tom and [http://nl.linkedin.com/pub/ilona-six/6/a2a/79b Ilona Six] who had been doing so much [[anal]] and [[coprophagia]] with each other that they one day said "Hey, don't we know a dude who likes to stitch people [[ass to mouth]] so that they'd be forced to do coprophagia whether they liked it or not? " They did. [[WTF|Tom Six stated that the inspiration for the film came from a joke about punishing people who were nasty or annoying, or a child molester by stitching their mouths to the anus of an overweight truck driver. From here came what he saw as the concept for a great horror movie]].

==[[Ass to mouth|The artist's reason for creating]]==
[[Shit nobody cares about|Many people mistakenly believe that The Human Centipede was just some erotic horror film.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The film was in fact, an enlightened postmodern social commentary on the folly of capitalism.  The head of the centipede was the upper class and the ones below them the lower classes.  It depicts the distribution of wealth among the classes using the metaphor of food and why capitalism fails society.  Most people do not understand this because they are shallow, classless, superficial phonies that do not appreciate the arts and refined thinking.]]  

==Plot==

Dr. [[Mengele|Josef]] [[Hitler|Heiter]] is a world-renowned humanitarian and difference maker with dreams of decreasing the world's population by making singular [[spengbab|new creatures]] out of [[gangbang|three people]] that share a single digestive system by joining separate individuals via their [[BJ|mouths]] and [[anus]]es and thus end world hunger. He recruits two hot [[American]] sluts and one [[Azn]] dude. The [[Jap]] was added to the film presumably to make the film appeal to [[weeaboo]] sick fucks. The good doctor then gives the three general anesthesia, and stitches the three together [[FTW|ass to mouth]].   

Once the surgery is complete, the doctor begins training his 'centipede' to perform various [[buttsecks|tasks]]. Things begin to look promising when he sees the front end of his 'superorganism' defecate and the chick behind him is forced to [[scat|swallow his excrement]] and the doctor watches with [[great success|great delight]]. World hunger? Problem solved! Not so fast: eventually, the butt-end chick of the centipede starts dying from blood poisoning and the good doctor is forced to put things on hold to replace the deadbeat participant with two [[vagoo|new parts]].

Sadly, some people continue to be part of the problem rather than be team players sharing the burden to help mankind and Heiter eventually becomes severely irritated after being kept awake all night by the constant [[BAW|screaming]] of his patients. Then an [[Azn]], as the front part of the centipede, [[buzzkill|refuses to do as he is told]], and the doctor is forced to beat him. 
  
Dr. Heiter has stated that the inspiration for his experiments came from a true crime story in [[Australia]] where a [[Josef Fritzl]] was convicted of being a pedo and punished by having his mouth stitched to the ass of a fat [[redneck|truck driver]].

He was also heavily influenced by the [[jews|World Trade Organisation]]'s [[wikipedia:Yes_Men#WTO|scientists]], who have proven that starvation in the [[Africa|Third World]] can be solved by recycling human excrement into [[McDonald's]] hamburgers. [[tl;dw]]? See 3:30.

<center><youtube>_RRDLzxFXjY</youtube></center>

The film ends with Dr. Heiter feeding a caterpillar to his human centipede, then marvelling as it emerges from the caboose of his creation as a beautiful butterfly that flutters off into the horizon.  [[Miracles|A single tear trails down his face as he marks its course and muses that "Perhaps all of man is like the butterfly."]]  As the scene fades to black, he begins to masturbate furiously.

To sum up: Watch this film! [[Unfunny|It's the shit!]] Guaranteed fun for all the family!

===Sickening, disgusting and there will be a sequel.===

{{tinyquote|There are terrible movies and there are loathsome movies. And then there's that rare breed so idiotic, exploitative and sickening one wishes they could be scrubbed from memory. "The Human Centipede (First Sequence)" is such a specimen. Would that I had 100 legs to kick it. The details of the process, central to the film, are unprintable in a family newspaper — and so nauseating that the filmmaker should personally apologize to everyone who sees it. |[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-capsules-20100507,0,817598.story LA Times]}}

===I refuse to rate this film===

{{tinyquote|I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world [[anus|where the stars don't shine]].

===Crosses the line from horror to just plain sick.===

{{tinyquote|It's hard to say whether Tom Six's horror film "The Human Centipede" is more appropriately reviewed by a critic or therapist. Credit or blame -- depending on how one looks at it -- certainly must go to this aptly named Dutch filmmaker for producing an effort so horrifically twisted that it makes the "Saw" and "Hostel" movies look like lighthearted romps. And that's without an excess of blood and gore.|[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/the-human-centipede-film-review-1004087685.story Hollywood Reporter]}}

===A must see===
{{tinyquote|...for coprophiliacs and spanking enthusiasts, “The Human Centipede (First Sequence)” may be the year’s first mainstream fetish movie. Concluding with a scene that prepares us more for a commercial break than end titles, “Centipede” promises to return with a sequel that, according to Mr. Six, will make this movie “look like ‘'''My Little Pony'''.’ ” I believe him.|[http://movies.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/movies/30human.html New York Times]}}

===I'm going to kill myself===
{{tinyquote|I’m not sure I want to live in a world that would embrace this particular monstrosity, a clinical, detached portrait of a German sadist who performs experiments on two women and a man, removing parts of jaws and knees, sewing mouths onto anuses, and running a digestive tube … never mind.

==The Human Centipede II: [[Electric Boogaloo]]==
[[File:Asphyxia02.png|thumb|300px|[[Silent Hill|The Human Centipede]] being trained for Part Deux.]]

Yes folks, this film will have a lulzier sequel called ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1530509/ The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)]''. According to Tom Six, the film that just came out was a tame version that will just prep the audiences to get them prepared for what he really wanted to show.

{{tinyquote|1=It's going to be '''12 people''' and I've been telling people all over the world that The Human Centipede (First Sequence) will be [[My Little Pony]] in comparison to this film. In part one, I really wanted people to get used to this idea, this sick idea and in the second part, I can really use [[sick fuck|all my imagination]] and everything I couldn't do in Part I, I can now do in Part II.|2=[http://www.movieweb.com/news/NErUvrttE8mPvr Tom Six]}}

There will also be a third Human Centipede film (making it an A2M trilogy) called ''The Human Centipede III: Asses and Mouths [[Rickroll|Together Forever]]''. The third film is rumored to integrate Sci-Fi aspects with doomsday and horror along with a [[2012]]-like conspiracy. It is rumored that this film will have all of humanity connected ass to mouth and this Centipede will extend into space all the way to the planet Mars as a means to "save" the human race. [[Lulz|We only wish we were kidding.]]
