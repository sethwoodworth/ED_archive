Non-notable
What the [[Bureaucratic fuck]]s over at the [[TOW]] will call you, your website, your friends and anything you hold dear if you happen to be on their [[shit list]].

== What makes something Non-notable ==

When you're supposed to be compiling the sum of all human knowledge, some people might ask what constitutes an non-notable piece of information.  A satisfactory answer has yet to be given, so the admins of wikipedia have decided to interpret it the way they do with every other rule: Whatever the fuck they feel like.  This is why [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] has had its article deleted three times while [[shit nobody cares about]] like [[Nazi mysticism]] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pie Apple pie] are considered quality, high grade academic knowledge.

== List of things that are non-notable ==
* [[LJDrama]]
* [[Mediacrat]]
* [[Brian Peppers]]
* [[You]]
* [[Your mom]]
* Daniel Brandt

== List of things that used to never be notable, but are now ==
* [[Mudkips]] (briefly mentioned in an article listing pokemon)
* [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:ED in the News|apparently]]â€¦

==Geogre's Law==
The [[internet law]] known as Geogre's Law, named after the regular [[Wikipedo]] partaker Geogre, states that "There is a strong positive correlation between the surname of a biographical subject's article not being [[Grammar Nazi|capitalised]] and the subject's non-notability". This is due to [[13-year-old boy]]s abusing the search function instead of typing it in in the web address with caps. This also frequently applies on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], and is known to make certain uptight users [[rage]].
