Wikistress
[[Image:Wikistress.gif|frame|left]]
First of all [[faggot]]s, [[wikistress]] is no joke.  My friend [[wikicide|died from it]].  There he was editing his wikipedia, so happy, next day, I read in the obituaries he put a [[suicide|bullet through his head]].  [[Srsly]].

Wikistress is "stress" built up on a "Wiki", or website.  Since many [[Wikipedo]]s confuse [[TOW]] with [[RL]], [[wikicide|consequences]] ensue.
