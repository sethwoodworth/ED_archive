'''NORP''' (sometimes known on the [[internet]] as '''normalfags,''' or '''neurotypicals''' if you're [[autistic]]) is an epithet from the police [[acronym]] for '''Normal Ordinary Responsible Person''' (aka "Joe Q. Public") and the antithesis of [[Anonymous]]. 

They are the exact opposite of [[virgins]], [[nerds]], [[geeks]], [[aspies]], [[neckbeard|neckbeards]] and other [[internet]] dwelling rejects. These people are fairly normal; they are your everyday joe shmoe who lives [[IRL]] has a girl/boy friend, [[car]] and a [[job]].

'''NORPs''' [[win|go to work, have a circle of friends in the real world, go to events outside their homes, have adequate conversational skills and have very little to no mental disabilities]] that would otherwise drive them to go on the internet. Despite appearing to have an otherwise mundane life not filled with [[memes]] and internet in-jokes, '''NORPs''' and '''normalfags''' are pros at [[sex|getting laid]], compared to the typical netizen. Indeed, most of these people lost their virginity sometime in their teens and occasionally have playful fun with casual sex partners in their free time.

==What Is NORP?==
'''NORPs''' and '''normalfags''' are a diverse group. They are that generic looking guy who walked passed you on the street, the receptionist in a corporate building, that guy who fixed the air conditioner. They range from young to old and rich to poor.

Younger '''NORPs''' and '''normalfags''' spend their time trying to [[life|fail|get laid, partying, going to concerts, getting laid]], going on to [[facebook]], and getting [[drunk|shit faced]] and high. The younger generation is everything many anons want to be but just can't attain. They are also what many older NORPs want to be as well.

The older '''NORPs''' are [[Xtian|church-going]], law biding [[Red State]] citizen who have a spouse and two-point-five kids (two [[13 year old boy|boys]] and a [[16 year old girl|girl]]), a [[boring|9-5 job]], a small house in the suburbs with a neatly tended garden, and who builds replicas of 18th Century sailing ships out of toothpicks in his basement. They also likes all-you-can-eat "Surf & Turf" night at TGIFridays and watches [[football|Monday Night Football]], [[Fox News]] and [[Soap Operas]] religiously.

==NORPs, Normalfags and The Internet==
NORPs/Normalfags are casual internet users. They usually only use it to go to [[google]], look at [[jewtube]] videos or check their [[facebook]]. They visit their [[facebook|favorite social networking site]] when they're at work, look at the latest popular internet video that everyone is watching, check their email to connect with friends and use [[Ebay]] to buy stupid shit. Many normalfags haven't heard of some of the [[b|shadier sides of the internet]]. For normalfags the internet just isn't [[serious business]]...(the exceptions being the many hours spent [[elohel]]ing at "lolcats" on [[I Can Has Cheezburger]] and [[WebMD]], where they feed their hypochondria prior to visiting their doctor and annoying the fuck out of him with their own diagnoses)

...until -that is- it makes them [[buy a dog]]. 

If a NORP should happen upon the likes of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] or [[B|/b/]], they would not only [[shit bricks]] but prolly call the [[Party Van]] (which they call "the authorities"). Many of these people (including the older ones) are [[shocked and appalled]] by such Internets phenomena like the [[Megan Meier]] affair and get all [[OMG|atwitter]] when they see reports about [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS]] and [[cyber bully|cyber bullying]] on local [[Faux News|TV news reports]] that 'expose' the shenanigans of [[anon]].

===The Normalfag Invasion===
{{quote|Normalfags assume everyone was raised exactly the same and had all the same experiences/opportunities, and that any failing with women is a lack of will.| SHiNfinity Is My Taigaberryking expert: THE LIQUID BOOGIE INFILTRATOR}}

Despite that the internet has been the home of societies' rejects since its inception, normalfags have been slowly seeping into it. Overtime as more normalfags become aware of internet communities, they slowly congregate there, forcing the internet dwellers to form newer more secluded locations to discuss why [[fact|women are bitches and whores]].

[[4chan]], after years of being a [[Wapanese|weeaboo]] and [[pedo]] hotspot has [[chanology|become extremely popular due to unforeseen events]]. Normalfags, wanting to see what all the buzz is about, have begun visiting 4chan and some had journeyed into the board /r9k/. [[r9k|/r9k/]] is 4chans de facto board for discussing the finer points of life such as, why are we such losers? Why can't I get a girlfriend/get laid? And the old classic [[fact|women are WHORES WHORES WHORES]]!!! When the normalfags began arriving they went on some threads and started to give advice on how to improve the robots current social situation. The [[oldfag]] robots got butt-hurt that someone else, more popular and happier was giving them advice on how to talk to girls, which of course threatened their fragile ego. So the Oldfag robots lashed out at the normalfag newcomers and played victim. /r9k/ was full of threads about how to be good around people and be more sociable whilst other threads are created to complain about the normalfags on the board, ruining the community. Due to irreconcilable philosophical differences between the oldfag robots and normalfags, tensions rose to the point of an internet civil war. 
That is until [[moot]] created /adv/. r9k was previously known as an ''advice board.'' Once /adv/ was created, the advice giving normalfags went there. Conditions have improved dramatically since, though given the sheer amount of BAAAAWWWWWWWW in /adv/ at nearly all times, the residents have taken to calling themselves the s/adv/irgins.  A most appropriate label, truly.
