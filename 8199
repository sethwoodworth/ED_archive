The Gibson
"Hacking the Gibson" is usually the naked, sticky sheets wet dream of [[13-year-old boy|13-year-old]] [[Hacker|haXX0rZ]] everywhere. After watching "[http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&q=Hackers Hackers]" [[100|at least 100 times]] and seeing [[Angelina Jolie]]'s [[Boob|tits]] beckoning them over the keyboard, they usually go [[Insane|batshit insane]] with hormones and try to hack/crack anything on teh [[Internets]]. Luckily for most everyone else they don't know how to do jack except talk shit on IRC, hit themselves with [http://www.faqs.org/qa/qa-17039.html viruses] from Russian websites and then whine about it...on [[IRC]].

Anyway, this movie is so old it doesn't even have teh [[Internet]] on it. [[Dialup]]?! Pu-leaze.

Once you've hacked The Gibson, you can chill out in Walled City.
