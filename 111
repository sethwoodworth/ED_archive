{{crap}}

An imageboard composed of illiterate [[Brazil]]ians rightfully banned from virtually every other website. Imagine [[420chan]] without drugs and with the worst features of every other chan out there: 55chan has stupid wordfilters like in [[7chan]], newfags like in [[4chan]] and beaners like in SectaChan. Users are generally [[moot|devolved]] [[retard|retarded]] [[shit|apes]] and [[WHEN I WAS|most memes]] are taken from other Brazilian sites. The Jew is known to be [[Isreal|anti-semite]] and has an [[anti-lulz]] policy that anyone critical of it is permabanned.

It is probably the most moralist chan in existence. Posting underage sex stories, legal pictures of children, or simply defending pedophilia at all, is enough reason to be permab& for posting child porn.

The cancer level is amazingly high. 98% of users are always concentrated on /b/. Think of 4chan's /b/ with 10% of it's movement, but with 9 fags out of 10 users. Fags being: attwhores, trapfags, newfags and niggers.

== Story ==

[[Image:55chan_modfags.jpg|thumb|right|FADS = MOGS]]

Although 55chan was the first Brazilian chan to be truly host-independent at the time of its creation there was another board hosted on [[AnonIB]], named brchan. 55chan is a vanity chan built around a [[Circle_jerk|circle jerk]]. So, at that time, brchan and 55chan were respectfully like 4chan and 420chan wannabes, only [[over 9000]] times smaller. 

Eventually, however, some of brchan's users got fed up with its staff's inability to make a real chan in a timely fashion and decided to do it themselves, registering [http://brchan.org brchan.org] and creating a brand new place to post translated memes, "post ending in X"-like topics and other fail. BRchan lasted for less than 24 hours, in which its 14-old admins skipped classes and spent all day in front of their moms' computers posting ridiculous content and cheap-[[wordfilter|cefhcr]] photos from the local fat whore pretending it was her.

A war was fought between the chans and the AnonIB brchan owner gave up because "[[LOL_INTERNET|teh internet is not serious business]]". The new BRchan black person got [[butthurt]] because the host he paid for with mommy's credit card didn't allow porn and also gave up. In the end, [[Fail|55chan]] became the only home for brazilian Anonymii and, with this burden, it dropped its no-weaboo policy while retaining its general focus.

Reborn with 4 moderators, a zero cancer tolerancy policy was instated by unleashing the [[banhammer|b&hammer]]. The chan started slow and improved over time, especially after brchan downfall. k’s advertisement of 55chan through the web brought some users and mods, most of them were his [[AIDS]] [[friends]]. Due to users' demand, on December, the moderation made its policy lighter, and the chan started to flourish, having over 35000 users on peak time, according to its [[lie|counter]].

On May 26, 55chan went offline, as [[Interpol]] and [[United Kingdom|the brits]] seized 55chan's servers without any given reason or prior contact, maybe at a tip of [[Cops|Polícia Federal and the]] [[Orkut|Operação Turko]], Brazilian's own brand of FBI and Partyvan ([http://newserrado.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/blindado3.jpg Although Brazil has its own, official, actual Partyvan, the dreaded ''Skullvan'']). A couple of days later, Brchan was also offline and /BR/tards were crowding to [[Goatse|Livrechan]] expecting BRchan mods posting about their seized host and further laughter.

==Users==
Always trying to be [[internet tough guy]]s, easily trollable. Whenever they're not shouting memes like horny [[16 year old girls]], they're talking about 55chan's absolute dick suckage and how much of a failure in life they are. Basically, users are whining [[emo]] kids who use said imageboard as [[trying too hard|a way to try to look cool]], as an alternative to waste time at work, or [[virgin|in desperation to find a sex partner]]. Period.

==[[Memes]]==
Half of them are from [[Gaia|VT]] and the other 90% are from brazilian [[Uncyclopedia]] or [[AOL|UOL]] Forums.
