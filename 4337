'''Jimbo Wales''' (aka "Sole Flounder") is a long-time operator of [[pr0n]] sites, a notorious con artist and the [[ghey]] founder of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Always humble, Wales claims that he makes the [[Internets]] "not suck." Jimbo Wales is also the [[Queening|god-king]] of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which rules over such projects as [[Wikipedia]], Wiktionary, Wikiquote, Wikibooks (including Wikijunior and Wikiversity), Wikisource, In Memoriam 9/11, Wikimedia, Wikimedia Commons, Wikispecies, Wikinews, Mediawiki, Metawiki and Nupedia&mdash;all in [[Esperanto]]! From the name Jimbo Wales, "Jimbo" has become the common term in [[Ebonics|urban language]] for an old, dirty, and broken condom that has been used by multiple users.

'''Jimbo Wales''' is so devoted to the insane rantings of [[Ayn Rand|a shitty hack political novelist]] that '''Jimbo Wales''' says '''Jimbo Wales''' is even worse than '''Jimbo Wales'''' good old buddy Osama. When someone [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales/Archive_12#Altruism asked him] why he thought [[Randroid|altruism was a bad thing]], a [[Everyking|peon]] took the liberty of responding, only to be threatened with a ban. DISREGARD THAT WUKUPODO IS SUPER 1337!!11!!1

{{Quote2|Jimbo doesn't seem to like to talk about this, I guess because it makes him look bad. Honestly, I don't blame him; [[Osama bin Laden]] has got the moral high ground over him on this issue. And to run a project like Wikipedia while rejecting altruism is amazingly incongruous. I'd like to hear Jimbo [[Flame war|discuss it at some length]].|[[Everyking]]|while not busy writing an [[Ashlee Simpson]] [[fanfic]].}}

{{Quote| The world? I own the motherfucking world!|'''Mr Wales after launching into a racist rant about Mexicans'''}}

{{Quote|[[TL;DR|I see there are a lot of brownnosers here. Jimbo Wales wrote "Everyking, if you wonder why you are always on the borderline of being banned, you might want to consider what sort of discourtesy it is to not only draw a comparison between someone and Osama bin Laden, but to actually draw the comparison in a way that gives Osama the thumbs up and me the thumbs down." These are the appeal to force and appeal to repetition fallacies. Threatening a user with a ban for expressing his opinion isn’t very sportsmanlike. Libertarians are supposed to be in favor of free speech even for opinions that are not politically correct. As long as a person uses reason to argue his point he shouldn’t be censored. Someone with encyclopedic knowledge odd to know that a thing can’t be too absurd to be believed. For example it sounds implausible that Stalin killed many more people than Hitler, but it is a fact. Less dramatic doesn't mean better. If we were to make a survey on how many people's lives are destroyed by spending time editing Wikipedia for free when they could be doing paid work we might discover that their number is much greater than the number of people who died on 9/11. Secondly Osama bin Laden hasn’t been convicted. He is officially a suspect. You are aware are you not that in Democracies you are innocent until proven guilty. Thirdly Everyking was only comparing you to bin Laden in one dimension, straightforwardness vs. hypocrisy. He thinks bin Laden is more straightforward than you. There is no contradiction between bin Laden possibly being a worse person overall and being better in a particular respect. I am somewhat disappointed that you are simply bullying him, instead of addressing his arguments in a levelheaded way. … I confess that I benefited a lot from Wikipedia. I also benefited a lot from the subways and railroads that Stalin built by utilizing Former Soviet Union’s huge pool of slave labor when I used to live there. There is no question about the usefulness of Wikipedia. The question is, do the ends justify the means? Is it ethical to rely on millions of contributors to work for free to build this project? It’s all good and well that charity doesn’t equal altruism, but would a self reliant Gentleman rely on charity of so many people to such an extent to build his projects? The majority of contributors are not millionaires with a lot of surplus time. The majority of contributors are poor students who need to be looking for work instead of being sucked into flame wars with sadistic editors who take pleasure in defacing their work on discussion pages which Wikipedia is notorious for. Wikipedia is a virtual model of an Anarcho Communist society, a society I wouldn’t want to live in. Benevolence doesn’t conflict with self interest as you stated. Good people would only work better if they were compensated for their work. As successful as Wikipedia supposedly is, I say, if you relied on self interest and not only on benevolence you would get much better results. History shows that benevolence alone is insufficient or Communist countries would have been as prosperous as Capitalist ones. In football parlance, crossing the finish line becomes a bore if you don’t get credit when you score. Wikipedia is possibly the biggest scam in history. People join hoping they can add a personal touch, than all individuality is erased from their contributions. Fun! And according to the so called natural law deception is equivalent to force. So Everyking may indeed have a case here when unfavorably comparing you to bin Laden. As an act of redemption you should be straightforward and make it clear to newbies that they are just contributing to a common heap and that their individuality will not be respected and furthermore that they may be sucked in into time consuming flame wars with mean editors, if you have the guts to do it. I also think these sites like Wikipedia and Orkut are designed to be addictive. … In conclusion I would like to say that I am not a Libertarian because typical Libertarians are inconsistent with their own philosophy, starting with Ayn Rand herself. If they were consistent, the natural law should be extrapolated to all living things, plants, animals and humans. But Libertarianism/Objectivism seem to be nothing but rhetorical ammunition for hypocritical people who want liberty only for themselves. They make up the bulk of the Libertarian party.]]|'''User 76.31.110.124'''|color=#FF00CC}}

TL;DR: Jimbo Wales is a hypocrite asking for donations while being a libertarian. Then again, a hypocritical libertarian is just redundant.

==Shitty Bands==
'''Jimbo Wales''' bears a creepy resemblance to Chris Martin of the shitty band Coldplay. He is also known to engage in [[hissy fit]]s on some of the Wikipedia talk-pages. '''Jimbo Wales''' also has a beautiful [[BME#ZOMG I got a new tattoo|anal piercing]] which he loves to show off at Wikimania.

It is [[common knowledge]] that '''Jimbo Wales''' is a self-loving faggot, who suffers from advanced megalomania. This can be clearly seen in [http://news.com.com/Open-sourcing+the+news/2008-1025_3-5515166.html/ this] article about "Wikinews", which is a fucking dodgy idea if ever there was one. It is believed that this megalomania stems from the almost constant molestation that '''Jimbo Wales''' suffered as [[WHEN I WAS|a young boy]]. The frequency with which '''Jimbo Wales''' suffered [[Buttsecks|sodomization]] led '''Jimbo Wales''' to believe that '''Jimbo Wales''' was special. This belief was further reinforced when '''Jimbo Wales''' first encountered teh [[goatse]], and realised the full stretchability of the anus of '''Jimbo Wales''': even [[moar]] than Kirk Johnson's.

When '''Jimbo Wales''' (or Jewbo, or "Jimmy", as his own [[TOW]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales article] calls '''Jimbo Wales''' in a failed attempt to make '''Jimbo Wales''' cool and hip instead of the douchey and pissy troll that is '''Jimbo Wales''' [[IRL]]) was a boy, he lived with his [[this_is_warmth|grandmother]], who owned a lovely set [[Grammar Nazi|uv]] encyclopedias. '''Jimbo Wales''' delighted in drawing [[cock]]s all over the pages, but later regretted this; when '''Jimbo Wales'''' grandmother [[Stumbleupon|stumbled upon]] the vandalism, she slapped the [[Jesus|bejeezus]] out of '''Jimbo Wales''' and dragged '''Jimbo Wales''' to the local [[Catholic]] church to be [[in the ass|sodomized]]. "If only we can find a way to undo your vandalism!" she muttered as she watched the priest have his way with '''Jimbo Wales'''.

The incident moved '''Jimbo Wales''' greatly, inspiring '''Jimbo Wales''' when '''Jimbo Wales''' later decided to follow [[Ayn Rand|'''Jimbo Wales'''' cunt leader]] by moving from [[pr0n]] to getting other people to make an encyclopedia for '''Jimbo Wales'''' own [[profit]]!!1!?1. Remembering '''Jimbo Wales'''' joyous days of toilet training as an infant, '''Jimbo Wales''' wanted it to be easily vandalized yet efficient to clean up. '''Jimbo Wales''' lured vandals into '''Jimbo Wales'''' encyclopedia by allowing [[anonymous pussy|anonymous]] editing, and appointed other [[anonymous pussy|anonymous]] to clean up the vandalism so it never got boring for the [[vandal]]s.  Finally, [[anonymous pussy|anonymous]] declared himself "High Priest of Wikipedia", and made the final step in the [[internet tough guy|vandal punishment process]]: "Sodomy by Jimbo", ensuring that '''Jimbo Wales''', like [[Ayn Rand|'''Jimbo Wales'''' inspiration]], would have a [[plethora]] of boys to [http://sonicgivesadviceonrape.ytmnsfw.com/ anally rape.]

'''Jimbo Wales''' gets all of his minions together every year for a convention called [[Wikimania]]. The purposes of the convention are to endorse [[pedophilia]] and force the administrators to join [[NAMBLA]].

===Founding of Wikipedia===
[[Truth|'''Jimbo Wales'''  is also a HUGE fan of historical revisionism.]] '''Jimbo Wales''' is currently attempting to erase the fact that the co-founder of Wikipedia, [[Larry Sanger]], had anything to do with its creation or that he even exists, and has already let people forget who was the actual founder of Wikipedia, [[Ben Kovitz]]. He can get away with this because Sanger and Kovitz are both Jewish, so nobody takes them seriously. He has edited his User Page on Wikipedia to change it from his being its co-founder to being its [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jimbo_Wales&diff=prev&oldid=128756308 sole founder]. Naturally, this kind of action is beneath someone as great (in '''Jimbo Wales'''' own mind) as King '''Jimbo Wales''', so '''Jimbo Wales''' holds secret, dark rituals in the Wikipedia Admin IRC channel after sacrificing newborn infants to '''Jimbo Wales'''' [[Ayn Rand|Dark Lord]]. During these heinous cabalist meetings, '''Jimbo Wales''' bids the minions of '''Jimbo Wales''' to do '''Jimbo Wales'''' dirty work, often whining about how '''Jimbo Wales''' "really wishes someone could help me with this". Naturally, his asslapping toadies are all happy to bend over and open wide, assisting '''Jimbo Wales''' to wipe the fetid presence of Larry out of Wikipedia altogether. [http://www.wikitruth.info/index.php?title=Jimbo_Fired_Up]

Of course, '''Jimbo Wales''' is well aware of the intense criticism he faces as the [[Douchebag|supreme leader]] of his [[lie|cabal of vitally important editors and researchers]] on Wikipedia. As such, '''Jimbo Wales''' is now moving to ensure that his edits and bans are [[sock puppet|democratically vetted]] and that others will carry on the work when he is [[loli|otherwise occupied]]. Although easily found most times [[trolling]] Wikipedia like an arbitrarily epic [[Hitler|fucktard]], and claiming that he's only [[I did it for the lulz|doing it for the lulz]], it is a known [[fact]] that he only does it to compensate for a horrific run-in he had as a young man with a person of [[trap|indeterminate gender.]] Needless to say, he got [[pwnt]].

In 2006, '''Jimbo Wales''' decided to [[White Knight|lend his personal support]] to notorious [[stalker]] and [[Fox News]] "babe" (see the pig) [[Rachel Marsden]]'s struggle to remove facts from [[Wikipedia:Rachel Marsden|her Wikipedia article]]. This [http://valleywag.com/362511/how-wikipedia-got-jimmy-wales-laid naturally led] to [[secks]]. In February 2008, '''Jimbo Wales''' was outed by gossip site Valleywag [http://valleywag.com/362374/wikipedia-founders-fling-with-fox-news-fox as being in a steamy relationship with Ms. Marsden.] After being fired by Fox, Rachel boasted that "I was on a date that night in Georgetown with someone exponentially more high-profile and infinitely more secure in his manhood than Greg Gutfeld." Who knew that it would it would be the Sole Flounder? Characteristically modest, Rachel described the encounter as "24 hours of marathon sex."

This "removal" involved censoring the [[fact]] that Jeff Merkey is a vexatious, sue-happy litigant who once tried to serve papers against a [http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SCOX Yahoo forum] that made fun of him and against 200 [[Anonymous|John Doe]]'s who laughed at his stupidity.

as an editor. Merkey later withdrew his financial support of the

Moreover, he travels more than the [[Pope]], and even tried to claim to the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] the cost of a $0.54 train ticket, the prick. [[Danny Wool|Some wonder]] if the [[retard|students]] who gave up their lunch money to donate to Wikipedia would have approved of that expense. Others argue that [http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/3/is_wikipedia_s_jimmy_wales_really_an_embezzler_ Jimbo may be an embezzler], 

But we knew that, [[amirite]]?

===Jimbo [[Cash]]===
Hey [[Troll]]s,

My name is Jimbo, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day trying to edit my online encyclopedia in bad faith. [[Lie|You are everything bad in the world]]. Honestly, have any of you ever tried doing something good for [[the child in Africa]]? I mean, I guess it's fun making fun of my empire of free knowledge because it was written by people smarter than you, but you all take this to a whole new level. This is even worse than the [[John Seigenthaler]] scandal.

Don't be a troll. Just contribute with your best knowledge. I'm pretty much perfect. I am the head of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], and co-founder of [[Wikia]]. What online organizations have you founded, other than "coordinating trolls to change the hard facts in the English Wikipedia"? I also get to spend public donations on Russian hookers, and had a banging hot ex-girlfriend (When she blew me, shit was SO gonna end up on [[eBay]]). You are all trolls who should just kill yourselves. Thanks for listening.

===Jumbo Penis===
A little known fact is that Jumbo Wales has an absolutely massive [[dong|penis]]; it is connected to his body at the neck.

==The Crusades==
===Wikipe-tan Crusade===
Despite there being a large following for the coupling of Jimbo and [[Wikipe-tan]] in various fan fiction tales, Jimbo hates the idea of he and Wikipe's love so much that he will delete any mention of it. He has also deleted images of her that people have uploaded to the Commons, saying that they are too erotic. Luckily, they are available for you on ED.

===Porn Crusade===
Recently, Jimbo started a crusade against watching art/porn on Wikimedia sites.
*[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Art May 7 conversation], attempting to justify his deletion of a Félicien Rops drawing on the grounds that it's pornographic.
*[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/05/07/wikipedia-purges-porn Fox News reports] that Jimbo is flushing all images of genitals and nudity on all Wikimedia sites due to pressure from [[Larry Sanger]], the [[FBI]] and of course, [[Fox News]].

{{quote|Unfortunately, Jimbo and Fox News, being American, don't have the slightest clue what "porn" is. If they could stop thumping their Bibles for a moment and cease confusing [[tiny penis|their own penises]] with their [[guns]], they'd work out quickly enough that a fair majority of what has been deleted is not, in fact, porn at all. No one comes to Commons to jack off to works of art from the nineteenth century.|[[Wikipedo]] Maedin, overlooking that one can easily jack off to 19th century art}}

===Racism Crusade===
{{quote|I think people making racist remarks or self-identifying as racists should be instantly banned as well.|[http://tinyurl.com/2fu2dak Jimbo Wales, July 8, 2010]}}

Recognizing the increasing [[profit|value]] in censoring free speech while labeling people he disagrees with as prejudiced and lacking NPOV, Jimbo wants us to know that he'll PROTECT THE CHILDREN.

This has caused [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Child_protection#Self-identifying_as_racists some concern] among his fellow Wikipedians, who were already alarmed by his Wikimedia Commons crusade against all erotic or nude images.
