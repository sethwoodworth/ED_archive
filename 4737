'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:LaraLove LaraLove]''', (now named Jennavecia) is a [[slut|dirty bint]] and administrator on [[TOW]]. She is in her mid-twenties and is a stay-at-home [[MILF]] of two young children, yet dresses like a [[16-year-old girl]] without any fashion sense. She also admits to having [[borderline personality disorder]], and is a massive fan of the shit band [[Tool]], known for their love of fisting and scat play or rather, the musical equivalent thereof.  She also has levels of [[unwarranted self-importance]] rivaled only by [[Sceptre]].

She has been called "the most hated MySpace user on Wikipedia" by the [[Wikipedia Review]], where she transforms into her alter-ego "LaraHate". She also left Wikipedia for a [[wikibreak|short while]], like a typical drama queen, but due to Wikipedia being as addictive as [[heroin]], she was back binging on it after a few weeks in [[IRL|rehab]]. Due to the fact that she is also [[batshit insane]], she is a fan of [[scat]] [[rape]] [[porn]].

==[[Moar]] about LaraLove==

[[Image:Mahavishnu-Orchestra-Birds-Of-Fire-334993.jpg|thumb|One random example of the [[at least 100|thousands]] of records that are better than anything Tool ever recorded.]]

[[Image:Tool parabola.jpg|thumb|left|LaraLove [[orgasm]]ing. Goddamn this album was awful.]]

LaraLove claims to be the mother to two [[Hamster|chinchillas]], but that's just a cover-up for the fact that when she was 19 and four years later, at 23, she got [[secks|banged up]] by an [[Josef Fritzl|anonymous man]], whom she has no recollection of. As a result, she has two children (and no longer drinks [[alcohol]]), but she cares more about giving [[Rape|knowledge]] about Tool (along with her [[BFF]] the_undertow) to [[the child in Africa]] than educating her own children. In fact, she is so obsessed with Maynard's [[patent nonsense|babbling]] that every second edit summary is a homage to one of his lyrics. They ''really'' should just get a fucking room together and talk about the [[bullshit|spiritual enlightenment]] which taking [[LSD]] once every seven years brings you, so that without [[harassment]] from anon as described below, they can be Happy Together.

LaraLove is also a massive fan of "[[newfag|lol-speak]]" of the [[I Can Has Cheezburger?]] variety, something which is also evident in many of her edit summaries. She's a "sysop and 'crat" on the [http://lulzwiki.org/lulz/Main_Lulz LulzWiki], a [[wiki]] that is such an utter load of [[shit]] that it is a blasphemy towards those who have even the remotest understanding of what [[lulz]] means. The "LulzWiki" [sic] [[obviously]] needs some of [[Grawp]]'s tender loving care as soon as possible. This use of lolspeak is a worrying trend on Wikipedia; even people like [[Alison]] are doing it now, although they probably wouldn't know how to use an [[imageboard]] even if they were given step-by-step written instructions for how to do so. Like many other [[fake editor]]s, LaraLove just edits as a hobby because she has nothing better to do with her life, and it's more interesting than looking after the kids. She is certainly not an [[Deceased Wikipedians|expert]] on anything other than the precise measurements of Maynard James Keenan's tool.

=="Her" gender==
Lara's level of [[unwarranted self-importance]] that's rivaled only by [[Sceptre]] is partly because she is one of the few real females, with XX chromosomes, who have ever become well-known Wikipedians. But so many of them keep turning out to be traps every day, LaraLove might end up being a trap, too, because she had two kids like [[Britney Spears]] and while Britney spent millions on plastic surgery, she still has this ugly-worn-out-mom look that Lara (who is also thinner) doesn't have.  Quite likely, LaraLove is the father of the children.

''But can we be sure?''

Okay let's go through the [[e-famous]] TOW "ladies".
;[[Alison]]: Unfortunately, rumor has it Alison was born male and her first name originally was "Butch".
;[[Angela Beesley]]: Although her article had some jokes with ASCII art and a pic that wasn't her, Angela's real pic is too fugly not to be a man.
;[[Durova]]: A transsexual in the style of Mr. Garrison. First comes out as gay, then changed sex, then oddly turns [[lesbian]].
;[[Jokestress]]:This person is way too pretty to be anything other than a natural-born woman. This is a famous person and well-known and we all know this is a woman from looking up her history.
;[[Kelly Martin]]: This is a real female-born TOW person. She also founded [[alt.religion.scientology]], though because she's a woman some stupid male pig stole credit just like men have done throughout history.
;[[Krimpet]]: A nerdy girl but still a girl. A guy would never have a name like Francine. She was instrumental in getting [[Bedford]]'s stuff off Wikipedia. A guy would've just fapped to that material.
;[[Madame Wikiwiki]]: A woman cannot have a jaw that square.
;[[Mistress Selina Kyle]]:According to [[Blissyu2]], this is Somey, a man.
;[[Persian Poet Gal]]: A pretty trap, but still a trap.
;[[Poetlister]], [[Taxwoman]], et. al: These are all real women.
;[[Rebecca]]: Also a completely real woman.  Would a trap claim to be a "feminist wikipedian"? No way!  Not a trap at all.
;Sgt Snopake: Was [[the party van]] posing as a 15 year old girl to bust [[Nathanrdotcom]].
;[[Publicgirluk]]: Someone uploaded a chick's nudes and got banned for it. On the rare chance it wasn't a guy, it's one less "lady" on TOW.
;[[SlimVirgin]]: Used to work as a spy for MI5 and during one of the missions, he had a sex change to go under cover.
;[[Urban Rose]]: This is an extremely hot trap, but unfortunately his pic with the vagina was [[photoshop]]ped. The real one, if it had been taken, would have had a penis.

So as you can see, LaraLove is likely a man just like all the other TOW "ladies".

==Bathrobe Cabal==

[[Image:Sceptre_bathrobe.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Sceptre]] before his [[rollback function]] privileges were [[circumcision|revoked]].]]

LaraLove is the most gross violator of '''WP:NOT#MYSPACE''' there has ever been ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ElisaEXPLOSiON lol, not really]). She has created the "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:LaraLove/Bathrobe_Cabal Bathrobe Cabal]", also known as the grand parade of  [[fat|overweight]] (and [[anorexic|severely underweight]]) nerdy men who [[No life|lounge around the house all day editing Wikipedia]] (maybe she is a closet [[FFA]]; although if that was true she'd be better going with the pie-loving Mexican of Deftones than John Maynard Keynes, but then that wouldn't happen because she's a white supremacist, as explained below). This is because she is [[ronery]] in the real world, and as such develops infatuations with weird rock stars and [[basement dweller]]s.

[[Sceptre]] was a member of the Bathrobe Cabal, but mysteriously disappeared from it recently. [[Some argue]] that this is because even he did not have the [[USI|audacity]] to design his own logo just for his Wikipedia identity like LaraLove did, as you can see at the top of this very [[article]].

==Love of Scat Rape Porn==

*Title: ''Lara Love''
*Year: 2008
*Director: [[Anonymous]]
*Aspect ratio: 1.5
*Synopsis: The film begins with [[Dynamic Entry|a knock on Lara's door]]. The man, whose face is not seen, is welcomed by Lara. They talk about [[bullshit|how the day has gone]]. The film then skips to a scene where Lara is seen from the man's point of view continuing their talk in a bar. Slightly intoxicated at this point, the man slips a few [[Rape|Rohypnol]] tablets into her drink. All becomes a blur, then the film skips to a scene of a visibly confused Lara in a [[Wrong Location Nigger|dark, unidentified location]]. Her facial muscles struggle to move as she clearly tries to resist, in vain, the advances of the man who begins tearing her clothes off. Soon afterwords, the man drops his own clothing and proceeds to insert his bare erect {{wordfilter|text=PENIS}} [[In the ass|into her rectum]] without lubrication. After some struggle from the woman, she eventually concedes and gives in to the constrictions of the phallus, which by this point is starting to gather [[shit|fecal matter]] along the course of its shaft. The film ends with a closeup of the unknown man's semen resting at the entrance to her rectum.

===Response===

[[Image:LaraBRC.JPG|thumb|Lara in full Bathrobe Cabal attire. Her Wikipedia t-shirts show utter devotion to the church of Wikipedia; didn't Maynard say "fuck [[L. Ron Hubbard]]"? Well fuck [[Jimbo Wales]], then. Just not in the literal sense, because if LaraLove's womb got Jimbo's semen in it this time, she'd shit out a creature that would make [[Brian Peppers]] look beautiful in comparison.]]

[[Image:LaraBRC1.JPG|thumb|At least she's not [[fat]]. Oh wait, a nice submissive fat girl would be much better than this skinny control freak of a [[woman]], unless you enjoy [[pegging]] as that's what she wants to do to [[you]].]]

{{quote|I don't think it's getting more fun...it's actually getting redundant. I mean, I write, ya know? But I don't write the same shit over and over again. [[Srsly]]. Can I get a sequel or something? Like, it should follow up with how the [[Asspie|mentally challenged]] attacker managed to give me teh gonosyphil[[aids]] with his laughably small pecker.<br>
<br>
Okay, so let's just review this cinematic masterpiece. A man so ugly he hides his face knocks on my door. I, in my [[Mary Sue|true altruistic fashion]], invite the fugly little bastard in. I ask how his pathetic day has gone, as if I care. The details are so painfully [[boring]] that the whole scene is edited out and suddenly we're in a bar. The way it's worded, he's slightly intoxicated when he drops the roofies in my drink. [[Obvious troll is obvious|Considering I don't drink and his dumb drunk ass can probably barely string a full sentence together, I'm obviously not drinking it]]. All becomes a blur in his God-smitten head, I just play along. The writer was apparently too unimaginative to layout the scene for the rape, so we're anywhere from a dark alley to his cockroach infested digs. We'll go with the alley. I struggle to get away, using my face only, apparently. I mean, that's normal, right? Yea. So, that doesn't work. [[ZOMG|Shocker]]. Then he tears my clothes off; some time passes, during which I can only assume he's [[ED|waiting for the Viagra to kick in]]; then he drops his own clothes and inserts his "bare erect {{wordfilter|text=PENIS}}" into my rectum (damn near killed 'em), without lubrication. I can only assume "{{wordfilter|text=PENIS}}" is in [[Capslock|all CAPS]] as a form of overcompensation; noted. I struggle for a moment, but eventually concede. Probably because I've realized I can barely feel it, so I might as well wait it out... [[LOL WUT|maybe try to push out some poop for shits and giggles... yea, that was a pun]]. Anyway, so he gets off and that's it. What a lame ending. I mean, srsly. It's literally the lamest scat rape porn ever, ltrly... and anyone who knows me knows I've [[Sick Fuck|read/watched ''a lot'' of scat rape porn]].|LaraLove, 6 April 2008}}

Looks like this [[lolcow]] has ''found some kind of [[insane|temporary sanity]] in this; [[shit]], [[pain series|blood]] and [[cum]] on [her] hands''.

===Quote from [[Internet tough guy|SWATJester]]===
{{quote3|1=LaraLove, (also a "white pride" person, as admitted in [[IRC]]) who is extremely close to The undertow, is freaking out here, after wildly attacking me in IRC over this. She's obviously really distraught over this: since she's chosen to launch expletives at people all over my talk page. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Swatjester&diff=212591441&oldid=212550887] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Swatjester&diff=212591829&oldid=212591441 and thinks WP:CIVIL is a bullshit policy]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:LaraLove&diff=212587615&oldid=212573022 Oh, and this outburst is beyond unacceptable conduct for an admin]. And now she's attacking me because I hold an opinion that is less than flattering of her [[Love#Love on teh Internets|e-boyfriend]]. With regard to The undertow, I stand by my statement. White pride and White supremacy are synonymous, especially in the deep south where I'm from. See our own article on [[White pride]], which notes that it is strongly linked to White supremacy. The [[Celtic]] Cross, the international White Pride symbol, is listed as a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League. [http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/racist_celtic_cross.asp] I've seen first hand racism by "white pride" people and personally experienced the antisemitism that often comes from them. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:420_%28cannabis_culture%29&diff=prev&oldid=207000683 Here, he seems to know what "self respecting neo-Nazi's" think]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Stormfront_%28website%29&diff=prev&oldid=205240082 Here, he defends well known white supremacist hate site Stormfront.org] as well as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Stormfront_%28website%29&diff=prev&oldid=206357300 here]. Please also note the [http://www.adl.org/poisoning_web/black.asp Anti Defamation League's statements on Stormfront, and the "white pride" phrase, noting that it is essentially equivalent to white supremacy]. [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=328 And the Southern Poverty Law Center agrees with me.] Based on these diffs, I believe that he is a white supremacist, and I stand by my beliefs.}}

===Lara Retaliates===
[[Image:kkk01.jpg|thumb|"Because where I live cross burning is nothing like white supremacy. Not even close."]]

{{quote3|1=Perhaps it's a matter of [[Armenia|where you live]]. Because [[Dumbfuckistan|where I live]] [[lie|white pride is nothing like white supremacy]]. Not even close. [[USI|I have provided evidence that shows ''the_undertow's'' beliefs, showing statements where he's trying to educate others about this very misconception]]. His involvement in these articles, as I showed above, was spawned from another editor's [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&target=User:LaraLove/Sandbox&timestamp=20080410170257&diff=prev changes and comments]. They were [[Racist|POV and OR]] additions and ''the_undertow'' involved himself to restore [[Boring|NPOV]] to these articles as well as to bring consistency to them all. If you [[Anal|look in detail through his edits to these articles]], you will find that he spends much time on the talk pages, discussing what is most appropriate. [[Bullshit|He does not push a racist point of view on any of them]]. He argued that "racist ideology" should be either included in both white and black supremacy, or neither. He supported the removal of details of a black supremacist from the black supremacy article as it was giving undue weight to [[Jimbo Wales|a fairly non-notable person]]. His edits across all articles, including [[Stormfront]], where, again, he was attempting to [[Edit war|ensure the edits of the other editor were correct]]. SWATjester's comments were [[TOW|not based on fact]], opinion or not, it was inappropriate and served no purpose but to discredit ''the_undertow'' and damage his reputation. It was, in my view, no more than kicking someone while they are down.

It would appear it is, perhaps, [[Irony|a matter of comprehension issues on your part]]. The links I'm providing show pretty clearly his stance on the difference between pride and power/supremacy. It seems to me there's just a problem with people having a misconception and being unwilling to understand that [[Divide by 0|not all white priders are racist]]. And that white pride itself is no different than black pride, gay pride, etc. It's pride in your heritage. ''the_undertow'' attempted argued these points. And even if you don't agree with him, and [[Irony|you hold an ignorant belief]] that [[Correct|pride = racist]], the links prove that he doesn't see it that way. Therefore, they are not links that support a claim of racist, rather they show that such a claim serves only to [[rape|damage his reputation unfairly]].

So black pride is just that. Pride in being black. But white pride is racist because...[[Obvious|why?]] [[Yes|I have to identify as American pride?]] What about White-American pride? [[Yes|Is that racist]]? [[Nazi|German pride]] > white pride for ''the_undertow'' is acceptable then? But simply identifying as white pride is racist? Then why don't we just merge the article into white power or white supremacy? Since [[Correct|I apparently have a false and cliche view of what it means to be proud to be white while not believing that makes one better than anyone else]].

''I am an immigrant from Russia (from Siberia), classified as "white" in this country (which I resent...)'' - So you resent being classified as white? Okay. Well, [[Nobody cares|I don't]]. I'm a white American, and [[Racism|I'm proud of that]]. [[No|But I can't refer to myself as white pride, a term used predominately in the United States, without being racist?]] [[Yes|I have to say American pride?]] [[Nobody cares|This is all so silly to me]]. I'm a white American and [[racism|proud of it]]. Proud of [[rednecks|my heritage]]. [[Lie|I don't think that makes me better than anyone else]], and [[Facepalm|I don't see how labeling it as simply white pride changes that]]. Regardless, it's sad to see that you agreed with me about SWAT's comments until you read my "cliche" view. [[LOLWUT|So, I guess that's to say you now agree with SWAT's comments about ''the_undertow'' because you disagree with the comments I made about myself]].}}

TL;DR:

{{racist}}
