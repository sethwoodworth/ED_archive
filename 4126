'''''Battletoads''''', ''Combat Frogs'', ''Conflict Amphibians'', ''War Tadpoles'', ''Internecine Anurans'', ''Bufonidae Proelii'', etc. is the most [[awesome]] game ever created. <s>It's a rival to the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' games.</s> It kicks the shit out of TMNT. The first game was released for the [[Nintendo]] Entertainment System in 1991 and then ported to the [[Amiga]] in 1992, [[Sonic|Sega]] Mega Drive/Genesis in 1993, Sega Game Gear in 1993, and Amiga CD32 in 1994.

This [[meme]]/[[troll]] started on [[4chan]] after a VG [[screenshot]] contest, the "'''Is this Battletoads?'''" phenomenon is now a [[retarded|modern]] [[old meme|classic]] and appears whenever someone requests a game title, information or screenshot. Another good use is to go to the most [[wapanese|popular boards]] on [[GameFAQs]] and inquire whether or not the game in question is, in fact, ''Battletoads''.

The correct answer to the question is, of course: "'''No, it's ''Doom III'''''", whatever the game is.

==The game itself==
'''''Battletoads''''' is known as one of the hardest video games in history, and it's also surprisingly good, assuming you don't go [[batshit insane]] trying (and failing) to beat it, chances are that you will quit within the first 2-3 levels. 

The story, in essence, is that a [[BDSM|leather-clad]] [[whore]] called the Dark Queen captures one of the Battletoads, [[cancer|Pimple]], and the [[slut|princess]], probably to [[rape]] them. The Battletoads' [[pedophile]] leader, Coach, tells the other two, [[AIDS|Rash]] and [[acne|Zitz]], to rescue them. And the Battletoads, being the Conflict Amphibians they are, do so.

The third level, being completely [[truth|impossible]], has caused many a player to completely [[rage]] while playing, so most people now use this simple plan to actually enjoy some of the game:

# Play until Level 3
# Turn off the machine and [[rape|insert]] a Game Genie
# Enter [[Hacker|GAXAALAA]] and begin playing
# [[????]]
# [[PROFIT!]]

==Rebirth of an old meme==

{{quote|'''STOP CALLING MY FUCKING STORE'''|Random GameStop Employee}}

'''Suddenly''', on the [[last thursday|12th, 13th and 14th]] of November 2007, Anonymous decided to prank call GameStop, asking for ''Battletoads'' pre-orders. /b/lackup was formed in the name of the lulz and lots of prank calls were made.

Moar than 40 GameStop stores were targeted, some stores received [[over 9000]] calls all day.

At first, some stores were friendly and explained that they don't have it. After a few hours they got really pissed. Some employees called Anon very bad things, things you can't say on [[Foxnews|Faux News]]. Other employees thought this was funny, and joked about ''Battletoads''.

A few weeks after the beginning of the raid, according to Anonymous spies, a GameStop conference call announced that all ''Battletoads'' calls should be handled politely. 4chan was also mentioned. [[serious business|/b/tards were called "'''a hazardous group of people on the internet'''" and theorized to be attempting to take over GameStop]].

PROTIP: If you decide to troll Gamestop, and they ask for a name, say [[Cockmongler|Richard C. Mongler]]

===2010: Re-rebirth of an old meme===
[[Image:Warfrogs.png|right|thumb|Blizzard causes massive butthurt among their own [[nerd|fans]] but it's for a [[lulz|good cause]].]]
On [[9/11|July 26th 2010 at 10 pm]], Gamestops around the country <s>will hold</s> held a massive pre-release party for [[Starcraft II]] [[Neckbeard|fans]] waiting for the game to go on sale at midnight.

==Best video game of 2007==
[[Over 9,000]] readers of Kerrang have decided that ''Battletoads'' was the best video game of 2007, many of whom were also avid participants of the [[4chan]] /[[b]]/ board. Lots of people voted, but the boards got shut down since people also mass voted for some [[Madeleine McCann|other girl]] as the sexiest female. The winner was supposed to get its name into Kerrang's December 2007 issue as the best video game.

<b>Update!</b> BestActEVER.com is currently using an autovoter for the 2008 issue which includes votes for ''Battletoads'' as the [[THE BEST]] video game.

==LiveJournal is on the case==
Sometime [[last Thursday]], LJ user [http://slaneyder.livejournal.com/ slaneyder] failed to [[lurk moar]] and made a [[fail| post]] in the community [http://community.livejournal.com/customers_suck customers_suck], whining about the people calling and asking for ''Battletoads''. [[Lulz]] ensued when several [[LiveJournal]] [[gay|faggots]] hopped onto the [[Anonymous|/b/]]tard bandwagon, under the assumption that being a /b/tard makes you [[retard|cool]].

[http://community.livejournal.com/customers_suck/23695308.html See the full thread!] - Featuring an old friend: [[Merle Whitefire]], survivor of the [[Bitingbeaver|First Feminazi War]].

Also in the customers_suck comm, known [[furry]] [http://defconn1.livejournal.com/profile defconn1] made a [http://community.livejournal.com/customerssuck/1238045.html post] about how a customer had called them [[butthurt|upset]] because one of his co-workers had apparently given the customer's son a case for a [[Wii]] version of ''Battletoads''. Obviously, as no such product actually exists, customer Jr was understandably [[Mitchell Henderson|heartbroken]]. "It's sad that [[Anonymous|some people]] are so bored they can only think of destructive things to do."

[[Image:Noesbattletoads.jpg|thumb|Gamespot's site as of September 1st, 2009]]


'''At the end of June 2008''', the pre-ordered ''Battletoads'' games was still not in stores. Since the [[developers|development]] of the ''Battletoads'' games for the Wii and Xbox 360 took some time, [[Anonymous]] decided to release the game himself. Covers, flyers and other kinds of game art was made. The plan this time was to sneak fake covers into GameStop stores.

Not so obvious memes were added to the covers, The plan was simple, fucking with GameStop employees as usual.

== The Great Battletoads Raid of July 2008 ==
'''July 12th''' is an important date for [[Anonymous]]. Two years ago marked the first [[The_Great_Habbo_Raid_of_July_2006|Great Habbo Raid]] and exactly one year later [[The_Great_Habbo_Raid_of_July_2007|history repeated itself]]. While [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY|protestfags]] were off [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|saving the world]] with their [[PROJECT_CHANOLOGY/OPERATION_SPY_VS_SCI|Spy vs. Sci protests]], the Anonymous who seek a [[LULZ|greater goal]] did so at 2:00PM July 12th.

== Battletoads: The Movie ==

[[Image:Battletoads_Movie.jpg|thumb]]

[[Image:200px-Bombina orientalis.jpg|thumb|Something you would most likely see in a ''Battletoads'' movie.]]

On 23rd July 2008 ''Battletoads - The Movie'' was announced by Universal Studios.

Due to the incredibly high demand and hype surrounding this movie it's recommended that you pre-order tickets at your local cinemas when they become available. Call in and ask about the date, all pre-orders get a special ''Battletoads'' card and 50% off ''Battletoads'' for the Wii at your local GameStop!

The cast includes [[Will Smith]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Bill Cosby]] providing the voices of the toads.

Preview critics have called the movie a CGI sensation.

Hi, I'm Gregg and I work at GameStop. I have a simple message for the members of this forum.

DON'T EVER, EVER, EVER FUCKING CALL UP MY PLACE OF WORK AGAIN.
I KNOW YOU PATHETIC FUCKS DON'T HAVE JOBS OF YOUR OWN AND YOUR PARENTS
PAY FOR YOUR SKYPE AND YOUR INTERNET ACCESS AND YOU HAVE NO CLUE HOW
HARD IT IS TO ACTUALLY WORK A FULL TIME JOB.

WHAT YOU FUCKHEADS DON'T REALIZE IS BY YOU CALLING AND ASKING FOR
BATTLEFROGS OR WHAT THE FUCK EVER YOU FUCKERS SAY OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
IT TAKES UP PRECIOUS TIME WHICH WE NEED TO HELP ACTUAL CUSTOMERS.

YOU ARE MAKING US LOSE MONEY. AND BY 'US' I MEAN THE EMPLOYEES.
EVERY PRANK CALL THE STORE WE WORK AT RECEIVES, WE LOSE HOWEVER AMOUNT OF
TIME WE SPEND ON THE PHONE TALKING TO YOU COMES RIGHT OUT OF OUR MEASLY PAYCHECKS.

SO FUCK OFF IT ISN'T FUNNY AND OUR STORE AT LEAST HAS ALREADY CONTACTED THE
AUTHORITIES AND YES THERE IS ACTION WE CAN PURSUE AGAINST THIS MESSAGEBOARD.

Have a fucking great day. And don't call my place of work anymore. 
</pre>

Apparently [[Irony|more time in work = less money]]

Richard: yeah, i bet you are. (click)'''|4chan}}
Richard Fleming is a GameStop employee that on 12/07/08 was on the verge of becoming a meme.
He was asked about Battletoads nearly to the point of becoming [[An_hero|an hero]].  
<br><br>
His fellow employee '''Eric''' picked up where he left off, while he was on "lunch break", though it is more likely that he was bleeding in a corner.  Eric was a fellow /b/tard and had a taste for [[Mudkipz]].

An anon also found Richard's GameStop# which is 714-544-9975. The Address of his Gamestop is 13210 Jamboree Road, Irvine,CA, 92602. UPDATE: Richard's new store is #5082 @ 26750 Aliso Creek Rd, Aliso Viejo CA, 92656. Phone #(949)643-8570. Have fun! Also in the news, Richard is hated by his own employees for his display of [[faggotry|faggotry]] of [[Over 9,000|levels thought unobtainable]]. Richard is also a huge fan of Full Metal Alchemist. He has angel wings on his back, saying they were for someone he knew in the Army that died, then telling someone else they were from Full Metal Alchemist. His appearance is one of a [[fat]]ass with a jewfro and the biggest christbot to evar grace the [[Goatse|mystical portal]] of Gamestop. Richard has fuckbuddies David and Jacob, who apparently is a /b/tard himself telling someone they had "over 9000 copies that came with mudkip oil changes".
