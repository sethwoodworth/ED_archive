Chase 'No Face'
[[File:Chase no face.PNG|600px|thumb|center|For those who cannot see why we would call such a sweet kitty ‘ugly’ – it’s because she’s missing her face.]]

Not to be outdone by [[World's Ugliest Dog|hideous dogs]], a very [[special]] Persian cat – a breed whose faces already resemble that of mongoloid – has taken a step further and may well be the ugliest animal which has ever lived.


==The Fuck . . . ?==
[[File:Chase no face 2.PNG|thumb|280px|[[Oh exploitable|Put this on your favorite kitty]]. Please, not literally.]]

<b>Chase ‘No Face’</b> was hit by a car when she was only a kitten. As well as having her left hind leg amputated, the vets thought it would be hilarious to see what the cat equivalent of [[Juliana Wetmore]] would look like.

Refusing to release her into the sweet embrace of death, Chase was adopted by Melissa Smith (presumed to be the mother of [[Kenny Glenn]]) who now parades this flayed feline to children and the disabled.

Her motivation for this is unclear. [[Some argue]] she is trying to show that [[lies|even the disabled and disfigured of the world still deserve love]]. Others suggest she simply enjoys terrifying people who are already on the brink of death. The true answer probably lies somewhere in between – although they may be as vile and unloved as an AIDS-infected [[abortion]], they are still far, far better off than this fluffy lump of despair.

The accident also resulted in Chase losing her eyelids, which means this fleshy abomination is always staring at you. Always. And it never sleeps.
