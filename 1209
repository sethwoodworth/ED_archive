Buddha: A chappy in [[India]] who had a look about and thought to himself "this life is pretty shite tbh" and so decided to sit down and have a little think about [[lulz|meaning and purpose]] and shit.  After a few years, he hadn't really concluded much but he did find that if he sat about for a long time and stopped thinking about [[life|horrible shit]] then he felt a bit better.  Buddha was a [[Too lazy|lazy cunt]] and didn't want to acknowledge the fact that he'd wasted his life [[Masturbation|fapping]] under a tree.  So he made up some [[crap|cock and balls]] about [[karma]] and rebirth and begged people for rice in return for [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|enlightenment]].  Over the years the Buddha's elaborate [[troll|trolling]] gathered quite a following.  [[fag|Bell ends]] from every corner of [[India|curry land]] signed up, and each brought their own superstitions and ideas.  Soon enough Buddhism had evolved from "sitting down and not thinking about [[You|how shit you are]]" to what it is today: a refuge for [[Sick fuck|closeted faggots and sexually repressed life failers]].

Noteworthy: For a long time the Buddha would not let [[Wimmins|women]] be Buddhists, insisting that they should remain [[in the kitchen]] ([[Fact]]).  He also maintained that [[fag|homosexuals]] could not attain [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|enlightenment]] ([[fact]]).

Even more noteworthy: In the Vinaya Pitika ([[rules]]) there is a passage that details the punishment for auto-[[buttsecks|sodomy]] (buttfucking yourself) and one [[expert|BADMUN]] monk is cited as a perpetrator ([[fact]])

More noteworthy still: Buddhism does not have a deity, hence it is a philosophy, not a religion. ''No doctrine without a deity is a religion''.

== Complete Biography ==
Buddha was born Siddy Gaudy, a prince in northern [[India]]. After seeing a hobo, a funeral, and a holy man on the same day, he got pissed and left his wife and kids. This practice of ditching your so-called loved ones for would soon become popular among black persons in the [[At least 100 years ago|1970s, '80s and '90s]]. He joined a group of ascetics, who were the [[cutters]] and [[pro-ana]] of his [[Last Thursday|time]]. He sat around all day listening to depressing sitar music, writing [[emo]] poems about how his [[The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air|parents didn't understand]], and [[Pro-ana|not eating]] (which is really easy to do in India). After a while, he noticed this was retarded, and decided to <s>just meditate</s> and eat some [[Drug#Shrooms|shrooms]] under a tree. After having some [[drug#lsd|crazy visions]] and [[Shit Bricks|shitting bricks]], he apparently achieved [[enlightenment]], making him the happiest motherfucker [[evar]]. He did not, however, die for your sins, because sin hadn't been invented yet. Now, he is worshipped by [[BAWWW|people all over the world who have left Christianity because of all the damn rules]].

== Followers of Buddha ==
Despite Buddha himself being [[Some argue|reportedly]] perfect in every way (except for his brief [[fat]] and [[ana]] phases), his followers often manage to be [[fucktard]]ed [[douchebag]]s. For example, his fans at {{ljcomm|Buddhists}} can generally be found  [http://community.livejournal.com/buddhists/1559736.html whining about trolling], [http://community.livejournal.com/buddhists/1541375.html telling people that they're going to hell], and [http://community.livejournal.com/buddhists/1509572.html taking the internet way too seriously]. Other popular online Buddhist activities include creating [http://community.livejournal.com/buddhism/profile failed communities] and babbling about [http://community.livejournal.com/buddhists/1889618.html completely irrelevant shit] for [http://community.livejournal.com/buddhists/1520945.html no apparent reason].

Only the [[China|Chinese]] [[azn]] retards depict Buddha as a fatty, since they never considered that living on [[drugs|hemp seeds]] alone and spending all your time meditating and sleeping in the woods doesn't leave you many opportunities to become Jabba the Hutt. These fat [[dickhead]]s often display such "[[art]]" in their [[American]] restaurants, where they avoid the total lack of talent that would have doomed them to starvation in [[China]] by serving the Chinese equivalent of a ham and cheese sandwich and charging 20 bucks for it. Their "Buddha" statues help to support the idea that just because you're morbidly obese from a diet of beer and deep-fried Cheetos doesn't mean you can't achieve eternal bliss and start one of the largest religions in world history. Enjoy your [[SARS]] and bird flu, Chinafags.

== U guyz i am ttly deep an sprtual! ==
Buddhism is a popular trend among filthy stinking [[Hippy|hippies]] and morbidly obese psychic mediums; owing to the fact that it is vaguely [[Azn|exotic]] and lets the believer look deep and intelligent without having to provide any further evidence. Despite the huge numbers of [[Fangirls|devotees]], most of these incense-reeking robe-wearing bongmonkeys have absolutely no idea what Buddhism is- upon being prompted, the reply will be to the effect of [[Drugs|"whoah man, it's like, and yeah, mystical and yeah"]]. One could attribute the total ignorance to the fact that these are the same people that believe in crystal healing and fornication with plant life, and one would likely be correct. Their complete ignorance of all aspects of the doctrine will not, however, prevent them from ostentatiously displaying statues of Buddha.

== Buddha - The Original Emo ==
[[image:ana_buddha.jpg|thumb|right|Buddha- OG [[Ana]]]]
Buddhists believe that [[Moar|"duhkha"]], or suffering, [[philosophy|is the fundamental truth of existence]]. According to [[shit nobody cares about|some fgt named Rupert Gethin]], "The Buddha taught that all life is suffering, and the only way to escape suffering is to escape from life."

Translated: [[Emo|Everything sucks]] and you should [[An hero|permaban yourself IRL]]. Why more Buddhists do not do this is unknown, but it would sure be nice if they did. Of course, one reason is that Buddhism teaches that if you become [[an hero]], then you'll just reincarnate somewhere, possibly somewhere worse, and you might incarnate as another [[Chris-chan]]. Buddhism teaches that escape from life is from complete apathy to everything, even pain, and you get that way through insight. But anyone reaching that level of insight would simply achieve godlike powers like what [[L. Ron Hubbard]] claims [[Scientology]] can get you, and you don't hear of anyone robbing banks through [[Psion Guild|telekinesis]], so you know Buddhist meditation does not work.
