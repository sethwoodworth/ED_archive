==Brüno==

''This section is about the Austrian annilingus enthusiast. <br>For the nigra-loving prostitute, see [[Rachel Bruno]].''<br><br>
From [[Hitler]] to [[Arnold|Schwarzenegger]] to <s>[[Fritzl]]</s> (he's Australian, failtroll) to [http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2008/09/2008928192942312509.html Strache], [[Austria]] has begotten a fine line of talented [[IRL Troll|RL trolls]].
'''Brüno''', another of Cohen's monomial [[sock puppet]]s, has yet to [[rack]] up a [[HUEG|hueg]] [[:Image:Hitler_gets_a_gas_bill.gif|gas bill]] in pursuit of the [[final solution]] to an [[Jews|alarming infestation]], or indeed to keep his offspring in subterranean sexual [[slavery]] (in fact, Borat may have [[In before X|beat him to it]]), but he is [[trying too hard|trying hard]] to carve his niche in the the lustrous Austrian trolling firmament.<br> Unlike Borat, who couldn’t be straighter if he [[incest|fucked his sister]] (wait, [[win|he does]]!), Brüno is a first-class [[faggot|flamer]]. Luckily, American men are [[sarcasm|very secure in their staunch heterosexuality]], so this has not been an issue.

[[Last Thursday|Recently]], [[MTV]] put on another one of their shitty attempts at being hip and [[cool]] with [[16 year old girls|their target demographic]] in the form of their movie awards, which is like the Academy Awards, but with a more [[unfunny]] host (usually an [[SNL]] reject) and crappier movies. Brüno made an appearance as an angel, and proceeded to [[fellatio|descend]] onto [[rap|Eminem]] and go in for Marshall's needle [[cock]]. Turned on by this, but nonetheless wanting to keep up his [[wigger]] persona (as well as keeping [[not gay|his closet door nailed shut]]), Eminem [[BAWW|BAWWed]] and left soon after in a [[13 year old boy|failed attempt to appear angry]]. It was later found out that it was staged by Cohen, indicating his massive troll powers.

As with Borat, Brüno’s sole raison d'être is RL trollage of the various [[republicans|intellectual and enlightened strata]] of the [[USA|Amerikkan]] populace and their [[fucktards|counterparts]] the world over.<br>

Interviewing an ex-Mossad Agent in [[Jerusalem]]:

{{quote|What is the difference between [[terrorist|''Hamas'']] and [[vegan|''hummus'']]?}}

He often induces the [[Crossmack|foot-mouth disease]] in his interviewees, as exemplified by these gems uttered by [[USI|vainglorious]] designer fags: 
*about unfashionable people:

{{quote|Why don't you just put them on trains and send them to a [[Auschwitz|camp]] and say bye-bye?}}

Reply:
{{quote|I would love to [[genocide|say bye-bye]] to most of them.}}

*on [[Obama|Bin Laden]]:
{{quote|[He] is [[fact|cool and fashionable]].}}

*on [[whale|Peter Jackson]]'s slovenly appearance:
{{quote|Mini [[9/11]].}}

Of course, his main [[cock|thrust]] is bringing up [[teh]] ghey, like this time with an [[Ted Haggard|ex-gay]] pastor:

==Der Spielfilm==


'''''Brüno: [[Delicious]] Journeys Through America for the Purpose of Making Heterosexual Males Visibly Uncomfortable in the Presence of a Gay Foreigner in a Mesh T-Shirt''''' is currently being filmed across the [[Not gay|completely heterosexual]] country of U.S.A.<br>

The production has not gone without [[lulz|birth pangs]]:


===Redneck Rumble===
[[Image:2131-bruno-cage-fight-sign.jpg|thumb|[[YHBT|ONE NIGHT ONLY! EPIC WIN!]]]]
[[Image:Sacha baron cohen bruno fashion show.jpg|thumb|right|Trolling a Milanese fashion show.]]
[[Image:Bw_bruno_baby_no_logo.jpg|thumb|Brüno with his son [[OJ]], whom he swapped with an African for <s> an [[iPod]] </s> a [[Zune]].]]
Leave it to the [[retard|God-fearing]], simple folk of [[Arkansas]]s to not suspect anything amiss with an event billed as [[troll|"hot chicks, cold beer, and hardcore fights”.]]

They paid $5 for admission and filled up the convention center only to witness two guys strip down to their skivvies and [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2008/07/08/2008-07-08_arkansas_wrestlers_kiss_and_make_up_for_.html maek out] in the ring. [[pwn|PWN]]! Melee of [[lust|righteous christian outrage]] ensued, and the also-fooled [[cops]] had their [[fap|hands full]] with preventing a [[bukkake|massacre]].

Entering the ring as '''Straight Dave''' and looking like '''Ted Nugent''' in fatigues, Brüno had the already adrenaline and beer pumped crowd of redneck men and women frothing as he took the mic and proclaimed that he was so straight, when he bought his house he'd had the back door [[cock block|bricked up]]. This brought the rabid house down, but not as much as when he challenged a punter in the crowd that had called him a fag. This, however, was no ordinary [[homophobe]], it was Brüno's former spurned lover [[lulz|Lutz]] who climbed into the Octagon to get [[cock|a piece]] of Brüno. With the smell of blood in the air, the redneck crowd was in a [[batshit crazy|frenzy]], a charged up mob ready to see Straight Dave pulverise the [[challenger]] (or visa versa). Their celebration of hot [[gay|man-on man]] action was short-lived as the two men in the cage started pawing each other, ripping off each others clothes and sinking to the canvas caressing and kissing each other and sucking on each others' nipples. The [[idiots|none too bright]] crowd momentarily stood silently in shock, their jaws dropping like a [[I'm 12 years old and what is this?|a pre-teen boys testicles]], but as soon as the faggotry before them had finally [[derp|registered]] the celebratory mob became an angry mob and rained down insults beer, cups and folding chairs. A full-blown riot was in the air as horny rednecks wanting in on the action, tried to scale the fence and get into the ring. Only security and the cops prevented Brüno and Lutz from getting lynched and/or [[buttsex]]ed.

===[[Babyfuck|Babyfickenfreizeitbeschäftigung]]===

Leave it to the god-fearing, simple folk of Dulles, [[Texas|Dumbfuckistan]] to not suspect anything amiss with a [[RFJason_CL_Experiment|Craigslist ad]] offering $50 for 90 minutes as “audience for a new talk show discussing current politics/events”. Like their cross-border [[incest|cousins]], they got more than they bargained for when Brüno - who turned out to be the “guest” - strolled in with a black person [[babby]] (who was wearing a [[fursuit|onesie]] with "'''GAYBY'''" on the front, LOL). 

Brüno claimed to have [[Madonna|adopted]] the babby and, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0889583/board/nest/107425677?d=108804174&p=1#108804174 wasting no time], shew a [[Goatse#The_complete_set|series of gheyly explicit images]] on a big screen to document his recent honeymoon - to the [[RAGE|delight]] of everyone in the audience.
===Brüno trolls Ron Paul===
In the [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/dor/objects/863036/bruno/videos/bruno_redband_trl_040609.html recently released trailer], viewers with a keen eye can recognize one of Brüno's latest trolling victims, the internet's favorite politician, [[Ron Paul]]. However, the '[[troll|interview]]' is purely a [[troll|ruse]] in Brüno's plans to get famous by making a [[sex tape]] for publicity. 

After getting Ron Paul into a hotel room, Brüno starts off by talking to Paul about his campaign. When the film crew say there's a problem with the lighting in the main room of the suite they're using and need to break whilst they sort it out, Brüno leads Paul into the bedroom where he locks the door and proceeds to subtly [[troll|seduce]] Ron Paul with candles, Champagne and sexytime innuendo talk. When Paul finally figures out what's up, he makes a hasty exit, screaming "HE'S A QUEER!"

===Brüno Trolls Al Qaeda===
After failing to solve the eternal conflict between Israel and Palestine during a trip to the [[Middle East]], Brüno decides that getting kidnapped by [[Al Qaeda]] is the best way to become famous. In this vidya, Brüno [[trolls|states his case]] to a dangerous terrorist from the [[suicide bomber|Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade]] by telling him -amongst other things- 

{{tinyquote|Your king Osama looks like a dirty wizard or a homeless Santa|Brüno|über troll}}

<center><youtube>ElTgT35fZWs</youtube></center>

===Brüno Trolls Stage Mothers===
During Brüno's [[troll|attempts]] to organise a photoshoot he decides that kids will be the [[baby fuck|perfect accessory]]. Interviewing these kids' [[pimps|stage mothers]] and fathers it becomes apparent that they'll do anything to get their kids a part in Brüno's shoot. 

{{tinyquote|Your child needs to lose [[fat|10lbs]] by next week. Will you consent to liposuction for her?|Brüno}}

The mother shrugs it off and says she will.

{{tinyquote|Is your baby comfortable working with bees, wasps or hornets?|Brüno}} 

Again, no problem.

{{tinyquote|Are you okay letting your toddler wear a [[Nazi]] uniform and push a wheelbarrow carrying a [[Jewish]] baby into an [[oven]]?|Brüno}}

{{tinyquote|That's fine, as long as he gets the gig.|Mother}} 

===AufgabeFahrradFicker aka ExerciseBikeFucker===
The Brüno production crew also had to engineer a device to get rid of Brüno's excess carb's (so he wouldn't carbicide). The device involves both hand movements, leg movements and arsche movements. The latter moves in and out repeatedly. All of these feats were made by a qualified gaygineer who also used Tom Cruise for initial testing of the ExerciseBikeFucker. Other ass craving celebrities such as [[man the harpoons|Rosie O'Donnell]], [[faggot|Ryan Seacrest]], and most importantly, [[pedobear|Pedobear]] have also pre-shitfucked the dildo mounted on the bike before Brüno had his moment to shine.

=[[Wigger|Ali G]]=

[[Image:Sacha Baron Cohen Ali G.jpg|thumb|right|Is it cause I is black?]]

'''Ali G''' (aka Alistair Leslie Graham) was Cohen's first and - arguably - most successful [[IRL troll]] persona due to the fact that nobody had been trolled by Cohen until then. After successfully trolling the UK for two seasons, he jumped on a plane to troll the fuck out of American politicians, scholars, religious leaders and fucktards in both [[Liberal]] and [[Conservative]] activist groups.

Playing an [[idiot|educationally challenged]], crude, misogynist wigger [[Chav]] with a cable access show, ''Da Ali G Show'', Cohen presented himself as the "voice of da yoof". After gaining access to some of the US power elite, he proceeded to fuck with and offend them -never breaking character -until they either walked out on the fake interviews (if they were smart enough) or until they were [[pwnt|speechless]].

==Some of the people Ali G. pwnt==

[[old|Andy Rooney]], of the CBS program ''60 Minutes''. In the below vidya, Ali G. owns Andy Rooney twice. When Asking Rooney if newspapers should report events before they happen, Rooney suggests that Ali G is stupid for suggesting that the [[media|meedja]] could call an election before it was settled. This, in fact, happened in 1948 when US newspapers prematurely called the election for [[wikipedia:Dewey_Defeats_Truman|Thomas Dewey over Harry Truman]].
