Yes the '''Amazon Wish List''' is a way for shameless [[porn]] stars, camwhores and other cases of [[GOTIS]]-infected females to openly beg their attention-starved [[stalker|fan]] bases for material goods.  Don't have enough shitty Chinese scented candles to cover the stink of desperation?  Need a pair of new Crocs for your next bukkake shoot?  No problem!  Amazon wish list to the rescue.

== Simple to follow instructions ==

[[File:Amazonwishlist.png|center|thumb|700px| Wow, who knew you could get shit without actually having to do anything.  Thank you Amazon, and thank you technology.]]

Why it's so easy even a [[boxxy|whore]] can use it.  Tired of constantly having to pay for shit?  Is that whole "[[job|working for money]]" thing too much of a pain in the ass?  Well why not [[jimbo|beg]] for shit then.  With Amazon's Wishlist all your problems are solved.  Simply [[santa|create a list]] and then wait for the gifts to start rolling in.  Fuck, someone should have told all those [[anorexia|starving Africans]] about this program years ago, probably would have saved a few of them from starving to death.  But whatever, [[win|more gifts for me]].

So how's it all work?  Well luckily for us Amazon has compiled a simple to follow formula for use when begging online.  Though it does lack some vital steps so allow me to expand on it a bit...

*'''Step 1''': Create an Amazon Wishlist
*'''Step 2''': Suck some cock so that people will pay attention to your Amazon Wishlist
*'''Step 3''': Find out from your doctor that you now have a wicked bad STD
*'''Step 4''': Fall into a deep depression because your genitals are now look like blue waffles
*'''Step 5''': Gradually become sicker and sicker
*'''Step 6''': Find out that the STD was actually terminal and you now have AIDS-Cancer ([[Someone got peanut butter in my chocolate.  Someone got herpes in my asshole|It's like recesses pieces but deadly]])
*'''Step 7''': Someone accidentally clicks on your Amazon Wishlist five months after you died
*'''Step 8''': They don't buy you anything because who buys dead people shit.  God you're stupid


== Increase Your Chance At Success ==

Great, so now that [[you|you]] know how to use this [[shit|fantastic]] service you'll want to do a few things to bolster your chances of getting that awesome new 50 inch plasma tv you've been wanting.  First up remember that no matter what you are a [[girl|woman]].  I don't care if your dick drags on the ground when you're running laps at the gym [[truth|people online only give free stuff to women]].  Believe me, it's the best chance you have of getting the shit you want.  [[tldr|TL;DR]] you're going to need a huge pair of tits for this to work.

Next you'll want to create a [[blog|blog]] where you can post a link to your wishlist.  Don't forget that you're a chick now so make the background color [[sexist|pink or something]] and put in some widgets to blast out Linkin Park cause' I hear chicks still dig those [[gays|fags]].  Once the blog is up and running you'll need to post at least two different entries: One which talks about how [[emo|terrible your life is]] and the other where you talk about your love for [[blowjob|sucking cock]].  You need to make the masses both pity and want to fuck you.

Finally, if nothing else seems to work, threaten to kill something fluffy.  It's a well known fact that saying you're going to kill a kitten or puppy will totally make people pay out the ass to stop your psychopathic rage.  Just make sure not to post any of your [[dox|real information]] unless you're a [[1guy1jar|fucking retard with a deathwish]].  On second thought, scratch that, post your real info so I can write another article later on about your [[lulz|lulzy]] death.
