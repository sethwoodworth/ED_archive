Wikicide
{{finalsolutions}}

'''Wikicide''', not to be confused with [[Wikibreak]], is leaving [[Wikipedia]] for lyfe, like [[srsly]].  Similar but not always identical phenomena include:

* Request for removal of [[sysop]] status.
* Making a [[flounce|long, elaborate farewell statement]] on talk or userpage (see [[MONGO]] below or [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Miltopia&oldid=148859208 this]).
* [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|Deletion of Userpage]].
* [[Kale|Permanently Blocking oneself]].
