'''Bipolar disorder''', formerly known as "manic depression", is an excuse for anything and everything, even [[rape]] in [[Melmo]]'s case or playing [[Gaia Online]] in others. [[Retards]] often use the so-called bipolar disorder to justify being a complete and total fucktard by yelling, "I'm bipolar, you ignorant fuck! Stop persecuting me!!!"

Much like its relatives, such as [[ADD]] and [[depression]], the bipolar disorder is completely made up. Despite what doctors say, there is no such thing as bipolarity in [[angsty teen|teens]], or at all. This means [[Faux News|good news]] for you: You won't need your [[drugs|meds]] anymore! Feed them to your neighbor's children instead, they need [[penis|something to cheer them up]].

<s>Being</s> [[sex|Fucking]] a bipolar is like riding a <s>rollercoaster</s> serial killer: scary and exciting. As manic phases <s>can</s> will lead to nymphomaniacal behavior, looking for a bipolar girl ([[Gay|or guy, if you prefer that - and be honest with yourself]]) is in fact the only way for any [[basement dweller|internet user]] to not [[dying alone|die]] as a [[virgin]]. Just make sure you [[anonymous|don't leave your phone number or name]].  

Thankfully, 20-25% of all bipolar people's lives are lost to [[suicide]]. Unthankfully, <s>75 - 80%</s> 100% stay alive until they die.

== Signs/Symptoms ==
If you are not [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|happy all the time]], or [[emo|sad all the time]] you <s>may</s> have bipolar disorder. These are your symptoms:

=== [[emo|Depression]] ===
*Sitting on a recliner staring at daytime teleshopping for two whole months
*Not finding joy in [[rape]] or [[guro]] anymore
*[[fat|Overeating]] or [[Pro-ana|not eating at all]]
*Sleeping all the time even while you are awake
*An accurate realization of being a complete waste of human existence
*Another accurate realization that nobody likes [[you]], not even your dog (even if it is really hungry)

=== [[Coke|Mania]] ===
*Imagining that everyone <s>likes</s> love-love-loves [[you]]
*[[whore|Willingness to sleep with anything]], whether it has a [[penis]] or a [[vagina]] (this is not to be confused with a [[pity sex|pity fuck]])
*Realizing that [[meth|sleep is a complete waste of time]] and only inferior people do it
*Doing everything at top speed and at the same time, being an overall ideal employee
*Saying four sentences at the same time and this at top speed
*Plotting intricate plans to take over the world and remove anyone who tries to stop you with the knives you spent all night sharpening, because only you understand the problem with this world and have the solution to save us all
*Imagined power level is of [[over 9000]], while real power level is that of [[You|a fat man that's risking a heart attack]]
*Trying to kill someone with a scooter whilst they enjoy a dip in the Kiddie pool ([[porn]])

In short, you look like this <b>:D:</b>

== So called Bipolars ==
Most of the people who claim to be bipolar are actually not bipolar. [[Some argue|In fact]] out of all people who call themselves bipolars, only 1.4% really are affected. And the number decreases greatly on the internet. 

There are two reasons for feigning bipolarity. Some people want to fit in with the cool kids, and the bipolar disorder sounds like a really mysterious, artsy and trendy infection. However most of the time a [[fucktard]] or [[twat]] needs a quick excuse to get away with [[crime|malevolent behavior]] or [[too lazy|laziness]] while being in the center of everyone's attention and pity.

Even though you don't want to be affiliated with either group, the real and the fake bipolars, it is crucial to distinguish them. While the fake bipolars are [[kill it with fire|annoying twats]], should be avoided and shot on sight, the real bipolars may be swell guys and gals before they [[Meth|stop sleeping]], [[Bernie Madoff|steal and spend all your money]], then [[rape]] and kill you, your family and themselves in a fit of [[rage]]-driven mania and [[delusion]]. They should be avoided and shot on sight. And then staked through the heart. And then buried under turf. 

=== Ways to distinguish fake from real bipolars === 
*Feigning depression. Fake: <I>"I didn't get an iPod for Christmas, I feel so depressive and cried the whole day."</i>. If a person is really depressive, he will not speak about it, let alone move or post on the internet. He will simply decay and molder. 
*Feigning mania. If you tell people you are in a manic phase, you are not. 
*Announcing their suicide and waiting for people to [[DO IT FAGGOT|talk them out of it]]. Real bipolars will simply kill themselves unless they are too stupid to do so. Then they will be dragged into a psychiatric ward, get raped in more ways you could dream of and be too ashamed to speak about it afterwards.
*Telling everybody about his or her "bipolar disorder". Fake: <i>"Hi, my name is [[Whore | Kate]], nice to meet you. I'm bipolar!"</i> Real bipolars will not mention their crippling mental disease. If they have to, they feel ashamed about it. With reason. 
*If you ask a fake bipolar about his medication, he will answer something like: <i>"No, I'm not on medication, but I probably should be, haha"</i>, while real bipolars will simply kill themselves when they realize that they will have to [[swallow]] Depakote, lithium, and a crippling antipsychotic like [[obese|Zyprexa]] or [[obese|Seroquel]] ([http://www.psycheducation.org/hormones/Insulin/weightgain.htm which will cause them to gain over 9000 pounds)] every day for the rest of their lives. This is actually reasonable and should be encouraged.


If you are a fake bipolar, please take a header into a waste chute and die on impact. If you are a real bipolar, you will probably kill yourself upon finish reading this article. We understand.

== Trolling Bipolars ==
[[Trolling]] bipolars is surprisingly easy, due to the fact that they take their terminal illness [[serious business|far too serious]] and demand pity, or at least some decency. They are also easily irritated in a maniac phase and easily destroyed when they are depressive. If you are lucky, you might watch them switch from hating you to hating themselves to hating you to hating themselves and then [[murder]] or [[suicide]].

=== Troll Techniques ===
*Tell them that they are healthy and [[truth|just too lazy to work]]
*Tell them what a [[failure]] they are when they are depressive and engulfed in self-hate
*Tell them what a [[failure]] they are when they are manic and engulfed in [[USI|narcissism]]
*Tell them that having a bipolar disorder is just another way of saying "I'm an [[attention whore]]"
*Tell them that having a bipolar disorder is a [[dying alone|terrible, painful way to die]]
*Propose to play [[Russian Roulette|medication bingo]] with that elderly woman from next door
*Ask them if they would choose the red or the blue pill and then give them none or both, or none <i>and</i> both
*[[Rape]] them when they are depressive and insist that you want to [[Christian|wait until marriage]] when they are maniacally horny (however, you may get raped)
*Tell them that they are not special, just [[Eugenics|genetical rejects]]
*'''When in doubt!''' Tell them that they are being bipolar at the [[Lulz|first sign of irritation]], especially if their [[Bullshit|irritation]] is [[Never|justified]]. With good timing, it will always produce a [[Lolocaust|total fucking meltdown]].


'''NOTE''': Trolling a real bipolar person <s>can</s> will result in <s>personal injury</s> killing you in a blind rage (if they are manic).

== A Day in the Life of a Manic-Depressive ==

My ice cream does not taste good. It must be because the old pervert next my house has been raping my dog. I'm so happy, my dog has been alone for so long! Now it finally has a [[emo|slightly depressed,]] [[pedophile|nice old man]] to be with! Fuck, I'm having my period! I must [[blog]] and insert quotes from my favorite songs and movies on my [[MySpace]] page because other people's opinions help express my individuality! On second thought, I think I will look up [[anime]] on YouTube. Oh cock-ass-shitty-dick! [[retard|It appears that I have forgotten my password.]] Luckily, I am old enough to bitch and complain [[furfags|to my friends on]] [[Neopets]] until I remember my password. When in the end, I could have gone through the simple process of the password retrieval system. Anyways...Whoa, what the fuck?! Someone has rated my yaoi video one star! [[all caps|COCKASSFUCKBALLSDICKINMYNON-EXISTENTPUSSYSHITCOCKMASTERFAGGISHBITCH!!!!!]]
Oh well, I'm going to watch this video someone sent me a link to, OMFG these people are taking over the world!! I'm going to call up everyone I know who has guns and we're going to go and kill them before they stop us from breeding. Wait a minute, what is this? A video about a horse feed lot, OMFG those horses are being kept in a Nazi death camp, I'm going to go free them! But first I am going to get something to eat. MMMMM I love painkillers, who needs food when I have painkillers. Oh, look, Intervention is on, I'm going to watch intervention because those people are really PHUCKED up. Wow, an Intervention marathon, I'm going to get on [[myspace]] and post about it in my status. Man, I'm starving, I could sure go for a few lines right now. Oh no, my sister is here, she's gonna tell my mom I'm doing drugs, I better kill her and bury her body in my neighbor's yard before I report her missing. Thank god I spent all night sharpening my [[Weeaboo |knife collection.]]

== Bipolar "Art" ==
Many bipolars claim that their severe brain infection leads to [[delusion|unusual creative thinking]]. This is a transparent attempt to give their failure called existence at least one grain of meaning. Subconsciously knowing the sad truth, bipolars are [[Emilie Autumn|very touchy about their "art"]], can't take critique well and are [[serious business|dead serious]] about defending their [[shit|work]]. Again, trolling is surprisingly easy. Just point out that their pictures/ poems/ [[cutting|self inflicted wounds]] are average and meaningless [[tracing|copies of copied copies]]. They will then write/ scream a [[tl;dr]] [[rage]] answer about how special and important their deep feelings of suffering are, which poured into their "art"... and later hurt themselves or you or any unlucky bystander.

Usual motives of bipolar "art" are people or figures [[Multiple Personality Disorder|split in the middle]], one side sob sad and the other coke happy. You may also see black and white or blue and red colored halves. The fact that about 94% of bipolar works look like this underlines how creative bipolars are. A variation of this theme are two hideous masks. They are meant to give you [[creepy pasta|nightmares]] for persecuting mental patients.

Furthermore, some [[fucktards]] believe that drawing bipolar bears is a smart pun. And because of this cleverness they will dedicate whole websites to bipolar bears images. If you are lucky, you may also stumble upon a bipolar webcomic. These are in fact very well drawn and comprehensible.
