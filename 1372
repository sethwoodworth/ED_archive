Catonkeyboardinspace, or space [[cat]] as he has become known to some, is a fearless conquerer intent on capturing the universe planet by planet, and eventually the internet. Although the first sightings of catonkeyboardinspace weren't made on the internet until recently, it is believed that he has been ruling planets and be-heading his victims for over several centuries. Space cat was popularized by www.ytmnd.com in such ytmnd's as http://theuniverseisunderattack.ytmnd.com/ and http://whatyouseewhenyoudie.ytmnd.com/, and it is believed that he will soon be arriving on Earth to destroy our pitiful civilization.
