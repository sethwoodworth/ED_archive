A retarded subculture worshiped and [[masturbate]]d over by [[skinhead]]s, [[heavy metal|NSBM]] fanatics, [[basement-dweller|conspiracy theorists]] and other [[fat]], [[You Don't Have Any Friends|lonely]] [[virgins]]. '''[[Nazi]] mysticism''' is so funny by itself that it doesn't even need to be made fun of.

Any one who further desecrates this all encompassing ethos will meet their untimely demise by my hand. I will make it a top priority to obliterate the impure mockery of your semitic nature.

Note by a Jude: We always knew there was something plain wrong with those Nazis. The phenomenon of "esoteric Nazism" demonstrates, beyond all doubt, that not only is the "Nazi psyche" barbarian and homicidal, but is also clinically schizophrenic, or, in other words, hardcore batshit insane. The Nazi virus is a form of mental illness rather than a political ideology (much like Old Testament Judaic [[Zionism]], as pointed out by Celsus and Marcion). In other words, Zionists and Nazis deserve each other and hopefully will combine to defeat the BEAST-MEN OF THE [[Creationism|DEMIURGE]]. 

==Selected Highlights==

{{Squote| Other theories involve Hitler having escaped to the Antarctic, where he joined with a [[Reptoids|subterranean dinosauroid master race]], with whom he now travels inside UFOs underground, generally beneath the South Pole or throughout the center of the [[Truthism.com|hollow earth]], but sometimes to a  Nazi moon base as well.|Okay, now that was fucked up!}}

{{Squote|
[Lanz von Liebenfels] claims that “Aryan” peoples originate from interstellar deities who bred by electricity.|Anyone else see a [[BDSM]] reference there?}}

{{Squote|I often go on bitter nights<br />
To [[Wikipedia:Odin|Woden's]] oak in the quiet glade<br />
With dark powers to weave a union -<br />
The moonlight showing me the runic spell<br />

And all who are full of impudence during the day<br />
Are made small by the magic formula!<br />
They draw shining steel - but instead of going into combat,<br />
They solidify into stalagmites.<br />

Thus the wrong ones separate from the genuine ones -<br />
I reach into a nest of words<br />
then give to the good and fair<br />
With my formula blessings and prosperity"|

Some of [[Hitler]]'s [[emo]] poetry}}

{{Squote|[[Wikipedia:Miguel Serrano|Miguel Serrano]] believed that Hitler was in [[Buddhism|Shambhala]], an underground center in Antarctica (formerly at the North Pole and [[Tibet]]), where he was in contact with the Hyperborean gods and from whence he would someday emerge with a fleet of UFOs to lead the forces of light (the [[Greece|Hyperboreans]], sometimes associated with [[Science fiction|Vril]]) over the forces of darkness (inevitably including, for Serrano, the Jews) in a last battle and inaugurating a Fourth Reich.|[[Srsly]], [[wtf]]?}}

{{Squote|While the purpose of [[Dildo|The Bell]] (Die Glocke) is unknown, there is a wide range of speculation from anti-gravity to time travel. [[Jan]] [[Vampire|Van Helsing]] claims in his book ''Secret Societies'' that, in a meeting that was attended by the members of various secret orders (Vril Gesellschaft, Thule Society, SS elite of [[D&D|Black Sun]]) and two mediums, technical data for the construction of a flying machine was gathered along with the messages that were said to have come from the solar system Aldebaran. [It has been] claimed that The Bell was a torsion field generator and that the SS scientists were attempting to build some sort of [[John Titor|time machine]] with it.|Turns out it was a power plant cooling tower.}}

{{Squote|Similar expeditions were organized in the pursuit of semi-mythical objects believed to bring power or granting [[Magic|special powers]] to their owner, such as the [[Monty Python|Holy Grail]] and the [[Penis|Spear of Destiny]]|Indeed. Crazy fuckers.}}


{{Squote|[[Nazi]] [[German]] [[moon]] [[All your base are belong to us|base]].|A line of wiki markup that is enough on its own to produce [[lulz]]}}

{{Squote|[[Some argue|It has been suggested]] that the Nazis had managed to [http://www.ironsky.net/site/ reach the Moon] and later the planet Mars, with these rocket-powered saucers.|[[Some argue]] that Nazis could just fly to the moon}}

{{Squote|[[Godwin's Law|Godwin]] and other authors including Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke have also discussed Hitler’s purported Antarctic reptilian companions.|What a fun topic for dinner table conversation!}}
