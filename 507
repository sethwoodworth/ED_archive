AniutqaDA
[[Image:Aniutaqadaadmitstracing.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Well that makes it a-okay . . .]]

This just in! AniutqaDA [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/933949/571439880 finally admits that she traces!]

[http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/ AniutqaDA] is a very delusional [[tartlet]] who seems to believe that tracing over screen shots, and [[recolor|recoloring]] line art from the movie [[crap|Spirit]] is A-OK. She has somehow obtained a very large fanbase of complete [[retards]] that will kiss her ass if she were ever distressed, and [[eat attack|attack]] anyone that has the balls to point out her blatant [[faggotry]]. AniutqaDA, being [[Poland|Polish]], [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/14476738/561691432 defends herself as well as her ancestors did in WWII], and so resorts to commanding her fantards in terribly butchered [[Engrish]] to ATTACK TEH PERPETRATORS[[oneoneone|!11]]. Also her dream is to be in possession of Cybertron Hot Shot's hawt, imaginary, robot cock.

== Recolor Goodness ==
AniutqaDA, being the [[sarcasm|epitome of originality]] that she is, has an entire gallery full of <s>[http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/art/Cabriola-jump-XD-67078479 totally][http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/art/Libertad-jump-XD-67041069 Original] [http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/art/Champion-jump-XD-67010839 horse designs] [http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/art/Tuscan-XD-66992346 in] [http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/art/Champion-info-66742753 totally] [http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/art/Arrow-info-66742666 original] [http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/art/Furiat-info-66742584 poses].

Idiots coming by her page are surprisingly oblivious to the shit load of images with the exact same pose. They most likely have the attention span of a gold fish, and think that each image [[spam|spammed]] into [[DeviantArt]] is something completely new and exciting. When in fact it is just the same lame ass line art with varying colors on a white background. These make up the majority of her bland, tasteless gallery.

==Her [[Lie|"original"]] artz==
To many people Aniutqa is only known for stealing copyrighted lineart. Little do they know that there is actually [[moar]] about her art to discuss. If you take a closer look at her [[Transformers]]-related art, you may see that the style closely resembles that of [http://autobot-windracer.deviantart.com Autobot-Windracer]. To make it even funnier, Aniutqa has stated on numerous occasions that the said artist is among her top favourites. Conclusion? This proves that not only is Aniutqa a shameless tracer and recolorist but also a HUGE hack, with no talent and originality.

==Steps to e-fame via tracing==
[[Image:Spirittrace.png|thumb|This picture was certainly not traced!]]
[[Image:Hiddencomment.png|thumb|left|AniutqaDA does the right thing by hiding comments that point out her blatant tracing]]

If anyone wishes to be just like the trace/ recolor cunt, AniutqaDA, they must simply follow these steps to become a [[popular]] [[Tartlet]].

1. Think of an animated movie from your childhood. (If you're a [[furfag]], Balto or Lion King work best!)

2. Trace poses and details from any screenshot of above film, or color in coloring book images.

3. Claim poses and such are copyrighted to yourself.

4. Deny any accusations of tracing, and hide comments. Always let fantards do all the dirty work!

5. [[????]]

6. [[PROFIT]]!

==Tracing = Popularity==
[[Image:Fantardlol.png|thumb|Fantards are right, you are clearly jealous of AniutqaDA's tracing skills]]
[[Image:Aniutqadabitching.jpg|thumb|Aniutqada bitching about being accused for being an [[truth|art thief]]. No worries, her bitches are already on the job]]

It's a [[fact]] set in stone, that if you trace any character (or characters) from a popular [[fandom]], you'll be showered in e-fame. This results in having legions of [[retard|mindless fans]] flock to your gallery to watch you and +fave every piece of [[shit|art]] shat from your unoriginal [[ass|asshole]] of a brain. These mindless people you may call "watchers" will defend you at any cost when you are attacked. They go about defending you with the usual [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/15031154/561464721 "UR JELOUS"] comments, and retort by using [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/15031154/561488309 "witty"] comebacks. When in fact, they have just made a complete idiot of themselves.

Examples of these Tartlets are [[lurk|lurking]] all over AniutqaDA's page. Their [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/15031154/561504001 tactics] are the most correct way to show that AniutqaDA [[ALLCAPS|DOES NOT TRACE!]]

== Drama on Livejournal ==
[[Image:Butthurtonlj.png|thumb|left|AniutqaDA demonstrates how butthurt she is]]
[[Image:Spiritbirth.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of Ainutqa's apparent [[sick fuck|birth fetish]]]]
[[Image:SKANADL.jpg|thumb|right|Capped for great justice!]]

The drama began when AniutqaDA happened to come across an ancient entry on the community [http://community.livejournal.com/deviantartsnark/ DeviantArtSnark] that featured her countless recolors and traces. [http://community.livejournal.com/deviantartsnark/1169074.html (Found here)] Overwhelmed with feelings of extreme butthurt, she decided to post an angry [http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/journal/15031154/ journal entry] about it, and even left a comment demanding that the thread be removed [http://community.livejournal.com/deviantartsnark/1169074.html?thread=16069042#t16069042 link] after announcing that [http://community.livejournal.com/deviantartsnark/1169074.html?thread=16069298#t16069298 "it wasn't funny!"]. Not long after the journal was posted, fanbrats began [http://community.livejournal.com/deviantartsnark/1169074.html?thread=16074162#t16074162 joining] [http://community.livejournal.com/deviantartsnark/1169074.html?thread=16080306#t16080306 the fray]. AniutqaDA and this particular fanbrat got the [[b&]] hammer before anymore [[lulz]] could be harvested out of the incident.  

The journal quickly became one of the top three journals on the today page, as large numbers of fanbrats gathered to defend their favorite artist lol. One fantard by the username [http://palominolegacy.deviantart.com/ PalominoLegacy] even went as far as making a Livejournal account just to [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/15031154/561569898 "yell words"] at the offenders, hoping they would stop. When they learned that [http://community.livejournal.com/deviantartsnark/1320396.html?thread=16100044#t16100044 their plan] was a complete and utter failure, they resorted to making an [http://community.livejournal.com/da_anti_flamers/profile "da_anti_flamers"] community on LJ! OH SHI-

[[Image:Tracerbitchleavingda.jpg|thumb|AniutqaDA makes a journal on changing dA accounts :(]]	
[[Image:BabyShit.gif|thumb|left|A horrifying .gif from one of AniutqaDA's alternate accounts]]

After getting totally pwnt on the interwebs for being an unoriginal tracing cunt rag, AniutqaDA has decided to [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/15053179/562439100 change dA accounts]! (As seen written in moonspeak on this [http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/journal/15053179/ journal].) If anyone is able to translate it, many free internets to them.

CHAMPION IS DEAD! BAAAWWWWWWWWWW!!!

With that death news aside, she has indeed switch accounts. This is the normal tactic for popular tartlets, because they simply can't bear to go a day without any fantards to kiss their ass. It's like a [[furry]] trying not to fap to [[yiff]] for a day, because it's just impossible. Be sure to expect more tracing in the alternate accounts linked below, and report them for great justice!

==Cries of the Fantards==

AniutqaDA's fantards prove to be nothing but morons in their unity of BAWWWWWWWWWing.

They have recently began making ED accounts just to blank this article. But [[blanking|blanking is pointless]], and only leads to them looking like complete retards. GG GUYZ.

One of them has just recently left a [[butthurt]] tl;dr comment on the [http://community.livejournal.com/da_ed/ DA_ED] community on LJ. [http://community.livejournal.com/da_ed/3838.html?thread=18942#t18942 CRY MOAR FAGGOT.]

== AniutqaDA deletes fucking everything ==
After reading a journal (now baleeted) a fanbrat posted after realizing just how much of a cunt AniutqaDA was. She has decided to delete everything that proves she is an uncreative, butthurt drama queen. These include the recent journals whining over this article and the people being OMG MEEN to her, and the "line arts" or repeated tracings of the same image over and over with slightly different coloring. She is most likely hoping that everyone will forget about this incident and go on pretending she is the most talented [[fucktard]] ever to grace the [[tubes]].

A few days later, she reposts the same images, and as always, fantards are there to +fave the shit out of it, and completely forget why she deleted them in the first place.

Too bad the [[internet]] never forgets. Ever.

==AniutqaDA acts butthurt and BAWWW's some more==
Recently AniutqaDA posted a <strike>[http://aniutqada.deviantart.com/journal/15218071/ butthurt journal entry]</strike> (BALEETED!) bawwwing about [http://strawberry-suki.deviantart.com/art/On-Tracing-And-Karma-67528533 this submission] that she felt was concerning her recent tracings, despite the fact that her name was never mentioned in the original submission.  No surprise that her butthurtness resulted from her fantard army to bawww about harassment and bullying.

== AniutqaDA deletes fucking everything 2: Electric Boogaloo ==

It all started when a brave tartlet posted this [http://spiritfoxgirl.deviantart.com/journal/15035083/ journal], providing proof to the masses of DA that AniutqaDA is a hack artist that does nothing but trace. AniutqaDA later discovered that journal, and proceeded to leave a [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/933949/571250832 comment] on the Tartlet's page where she ultimately [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/933949/571439880 admitted to tracing]. Upon seeing this, a fanbrat of AniutqaDA finally realizes just how retarded she was for defending her, and made this tl;dr [http://pookyns-5.deviantart.com/journal/15236691/ journal] explaining just how [[butthurt|disappointed]] she is.

[[Image:BYEBYEDABAWWW.jpg|thumb|right|CHAMPION IS DEAD AGAIN, BAWWWWWWWWWW]]

When fanbrats gather to read the journal, they realize as well that the whole time they were being "lied" to, and were defending a fraud. Much lulz ensued when these now, not-so-fanbrats [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/5445154/571874117 came to] AniutqaDA [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/5445154/571672331 to express] [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/5445154/571969433 their] [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/5445154/571854437 disappointment]. 

Seeing as how half of her fanbase was OMG MAD at her, AniutqaDA does what every butthurt tartlet does, and deletes fucking everything. This time, she didn't just delete a few images, she went for the whole gallery. The only thing left is a farewell journal, and comments by fantards, with the occasional retarded emoticon [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/5445154/571902074 reply] from AniutqaDA herself in a different [http://armandashark.deviantart.com/ account].

<s>Who knows how long it will be until she gives in and posts the images up again for her [[fans]] to [[wank]] over.</s> Disregard that.

==AniutqaDA's new account==
[[Image:Aniucantfoolus.jpg|thumb|Come on Aniutqa, you can't fool us.]]

[[Image:Aniutqadaisacommenthider.jpg|thumb|Much like [[kirbyslover]] Aniutqa is also a comment hider]]

[[Image:Aniutqafucksed.jpg|thumb|She's also obsessed with fucking ED]]

AniutqaDA makes massive fail yet again by making a 'brand spanking new account' at [http://arrowda.deviantart.com/ ArrowDA], posting the same Spirit tracings and shit that she has posted before. Like she did on her other accounts, the little fucktard will hide comments that call her out on what she did.  So obviously she doesn't HAET HOARSES like she says she does.


== The b& hammer ==
As of October 30th 2007, ALL FIVE of Aniutqa's accounts were banhammered.  Her primary account had been banned for requesting illegal serial numbers in her journal, the rest were done in for ban evasion. Wanna bet on how long it'll be before she starts a new one?  In the meantime, it's time for us to say 'Goodnight sweet Princess.'

==Polack done got her passwords stolen==
As of recent, a troll happened to be the butt of Ani's spamming. According to this troll, Ani is still, amazingly [[butthurt]] over her permaban on DeviantART that happened [[at least 100]] years ago. The price of being batshit insane, however, resulted in [[owned|losing both her email and shitty Polish art blog]] jacked.

Included is some art from the troll, to express their thoughts on Ani and her [[lie|fabulous]], but still traced, work:

=The Incident on the polish message board=
[[Image:Ulv_pwn.jpg|thumb|right|Ulv [[Pwnt|pwns]] Aniutqa]]

[[Last Thursday]], on a [[Poland|polish]], [[Transformers]] forum a topic was created in which users could post links to shittiest [[fanfiction|fanfics]] on the web. During this time one of the board's lulsers happened to stumble upon Anuitqa's fanfiction blog, and decided to post the
link to it for the pure [[lulz]]. 
Seeing this, Aniutqa stormed the board under the nick "TheArmanda", asking what was wrong with her fiction, and why does everyone [[H8|hate]] it so much. Her questions were answered when [[God|Ulv]], the forum [[Admin|admin]], came. Tired of Aniutqa's bitching and constant spamming, he told her that her fic was an utter, piece of [[crap]] which only an absolute [[retard]] could write. He also suggested her that she should either leave the [[internets]] foreva and become [[an hero]], lock herself in her [[Basement dweller|basement]] or go and buy herself a new brain. [[Pwnt|PWNT!!]] Below you can see the full translation of the whole post:

{{quote|<small>Well... evidentlly everyone is too polite to tell you this, but I don't
know what politeness is, so...

Everything on this blog is shit. Graphics, pictures, text, everything
is lame and indicates a high level of retardation. You on the other hand are
an evident case of being an utter moron. It would be a waste of words to critise you, so simply
delete the blog, hole yourself in some kind of a hermitage and go buy yourself a brain, I 
heard that students of the Medical Academy have some which they're using for testing. 
Even the one that's cut into pieces without pituitary gland and frontal lobes would be better 
than Yours. With a little bit of luck, you'd become a vegetable and won't come close to the
computer keyboard.

On this forum we have people that are against abortion. Your blog should become an
argument in discussion with them. This whole gang of idiots, unloved
by their parents, with a fast connection to the internet, is the thing that litters 
the Internet and makes it a hatchery of rubbish.

What's worse - after that, all of us true fans, are being identified with this
malaria, the sign of which you are. They think of us as being infantile... thanks to such 
kind of fanfiction writers who write crap and identify themselves with some shitty robot.

And the serie is called ARMADA, not ARMANDA. Armanda can at least be the name of the
brasillian soap-opera.</small>|Ulv}}

Instead of thanking Ulv for such wonderful [[Advice|advice]], Anitqua went completely [[batshit insane]] which resulted in an instant [[flame war]].Many lulz were had, until the [[Moderator|mods]] came and [[Pool's closed|closed the pool]].

Of course this didn't stop Aniutqa from spreading her [[cancer]] on the board. Starting to feel more comfortable, she decided to post some of her fanart, to show what a [[Bullshit|great]] artist she was. It was then, that some other lulser recognized her and decided to tell everyone on the board who she really was by posting a link to her ED page. Another flame war began, with Aniutqa [[BAWWW|bawwwing]] that she's completely [[Lie|innocent]], and that all of her art is "TOTALLY ORIGINAL GAIZ!!11!!". This however didn't help as the mods, who had enough of Aniutqa's bullshitting, decided to treat her with a [[Banhammer|banhammer]].

However she managed to come back after some time, brining much lulz with her [[Stupid|lack of knowledge]] and [[moar]] of her craptastic art. Whether or not she's gonna receive another banhammer it's not known, but judging by her habit of constant spamming and acting
like a total moron, it is believed that it won't take much longer....

=="Galvatrons" 2008==

{{rainbowsmall|OMG!!BITCH HAS WON AN AWARD!!}}

Recently, on the said Transformers message board, the admins decided to give awards, called "Galvatrons", to users who, throught the whole year, either became famous for their actions or simply stood out from the rest. Unsurprisingly, among the people who were nominated for being the <b>"Most [[Stupid|Interesting]] User of the Year"</b> was Aniutqa. Yet, it was her who got the most votes and won in this category.

<b>Congratulations Ani!!</b> Once again you've proved us that your utter stupidity and dumbfuckery goes beyond that of a [[Retard|retarded]] child.

= THIS JUST IN Redux=

In an attempt to explore new and uncharted territory where no one know who she is AniutqaDA joined [[Y!Gallery|y!gallery]] today, December 9th, of 2008.  She promptly broke da rulez by uploading [[furry]] art.  She was swiftly and immediately suspended for being under the age of eighteen.  Like so many [[furfags]] and [[trace|tracers]] of her caliber she thought she could get away with being on the site before she turned eighteen.

Haha... shows what she knows.
