==Plot==
In every episode, the Ninja Teen Turtles would spend most of their day chillin' in their shithole sewer with their master Splinter, an old, [[Ephebophile|perverted rat]], and April, a news reporter with a [[furry]] and a [[jailbait]] fetish. Then this guy [[Ninja|Shredder]] and his two retarded [[furries]] Rocksteady and Bebop would try to come in and kill them, presumably because Raphael owes Shredder ten bucks (long story). From that we learn why you should never talk to strangers.

People often make jokes that the original creators, Yeastman and Lard, constantly drink themselves into a stupor over the depression of what their characters have become. Depending on how much [[money]] they've made off of this, this is either slightly [[true]] or blatantly [[false]].

==Your Cast==
===Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles===
====Leonardo====
He leads. Or, maybe he was the one that just kept demanding things of his brothers. He had a voice that was a combination of heroic and whiny, and refused to allow his brothers to cheat or cut corners or be [[lazy]] or lure naive, tender children into the sewers with promises of adventure and understanding. He would often yell that "Turtles fight with honor!" If the honor of a turtle was supposed to override the sneakiness of the ninja, it would explain why these so-called ninjas almost never did anything remotely ninja.

Leonardo was armed with the [[Epic Sword Guy|katanas]], which were the only cutting weapons on the entire team, but the [[pussy]] would never use them, not even to [[cut]] himself. His color is [[depression|blue]].

====Donatello====
Does machines. Donatello was the mechanical [[genius]] of the show, although how he became this way [[it is a mystery|is a mystery]]. He is a mutant amphibian living in the filthy [[Africa|sewer]] with no access to schools, libraries, or adult education centers. Thus it is best to assume he is an [[Azn]]. Still, whenever they needed a [[trap]] deactivated or a robot turned gay, Donatello would be the one to cramp his bumpy little face up an android's mecha-pooper.

Donatello was armed with the [[penis|bo staff]], which also made him a skilled pole vaulter and the team's official source and target of tacky dick jokes. His color is [[Prince|purple]].

====Raphael====
He's cool but crude. This basically means that he's an asshole who everyone is okay with for some reason. "Rude" translated into "Bitchy whining" for Raphael, who could not let a single event go by without spurting out some bitch, [[Garfield]]-esque quip. In the opening of the show, he would throw a [[pizza]] onto your face. A scalding hot, melted cheese laden disc of burning food, just chucked onto your face for no reason. It's no surprise that none of the kids who watched the show liked Raphael.

Raphael was armed with the [[niggers|sais]], which is what you get when you try to make weapons out of corn holders. His color is [[Communism|red]].

====Michelangelo====
He's a Party Dude! Anyone even remotely familiar with the [[80s]] knows that "Party Dude" usually translated into "Loud And Annoying Retard", and boy did Michelangelo fit that bill. His main role on the team was to be irresponsible and get everyone else in trouble. He also was an incredible glutton when it came to pizza, often [[voraphile|cramming entire large pizzas down his throat]] in full view of poor, starving [[orphans]] who just wanted someone to love them. To Michelangelo, no Party Dude could party without tasting the tears of weeping orphans, and yet he was the most popular character. It is amazing how he eats pizza in the morning, pizza in the evening, and pizza at suppertime but never gets [[fat]]. Most likely he was a [[stoner]].

Michelangelo was armed with the [[retarded|nunchucks]], which were the most useless weapons in a series full of [[laser]]s that never hit anything and swords that never stab anyone. His color is [[juice|orange]].

===Other "good guys"===
====Splinter====
The Turtles' master and teacher, who's also a [[Furry|giant rat man]]. However, he did not start as a rat (unless you're following the movies, but who the Hell does that?). After getting kicked out of Japan for not liking [[anime]] enough, he spent his free time wandering around the sewers of [[New York]] just [[for the lulz]], where he found some turtles soaking in glowing slime. He decided to pick them up, and then he ate a rat or something, because he became a rat-headed abomination with a vaguely [[engrish|Asian accent]].

====April O'Neil====
[[Image:April O Neil.jpg|thumb|Oh yes, she worked in Channel 6 (9 in other areas)]]
The Turtles' human contact. She was a [[redhead]] news reporter who habitually dressed in a [[hott|tight yellow jumpsuit]]. She drove the Turtle's vehicles because she had a driver's license (she was older than the turtles) and couldn't really do anything except get captured by the bad guys and sadly give [[freak|some kids]] many fetishes:
*Yellow ''tight'' jumpsuit fetish.
*Female reporter fetish.
*Moar redhead fetish.
*Older women fetish.
*Rope (cables) fetish.

Her coworkers were blatantly gay and her boss couldn't stop yelling at everything. Also, her perky [[tits]] were the size of small children, and had a furry and jailbait interest on turtles, probably Leonardo (the Alpha male of the group).

====Irma====
April's nerdy, shy best friend and presumably her [[lesbian|lesbian lover]]. [[bestiality|She often gets paired with Donatello]] by people depraved enough to write Ninja Turtles [[fanfiction]].

====Vernon====
Wore [[fag|pink shirts]]. Also had a disease that caused him to become camp.

==="Bad guys"===
====[[Guro|Shredder]]==== 
The Turtles' hated enemy! He was also a ninja, and he dressed just like a ninja, in lots of pointy metal and a long, billowing cape. He acted just like a ninja, too, in that he always yelled and made his two henchmen fuck a rhino, a [[boar]], and a housefly so hard that they fused with the animals. He took his orders from a big talking brain that was jammed in a robot's crotch, and lived in a giant round tank with an eyeball on top. It was because of these very things that he was the Turtles' most fearsome enemy.

2003 cartoon he really an alien utrom fag named Ch'rell who want to fuck the turtles in the ass. He also a sick fuck that get head from his daughter Karai. It turn out that Ch'rell is an imposter that stole the original Shredder name who was a human and then bacame a demon tengu with a big dick, Because of that Ch'rell is a sad peice of crap, Who need to get a life. When the 87 Shredder and Krang found Ch'rell, they decided to take turn fucking Ch'rell in the ass.

====Krang====
Krang was an evil [[alien]] from another dimension who lost his body in an [[accident]], when he was banished to [[Earth]]. [[I]] can't remember who did it, and neither can [[you]] (honestly it ever really says). The end result of this accident is that he was reduced to a [[brain]] with a face and goofy little flipper hands. Rather than get all [[emo|whiny]] about it, he pulled himself up by his spinal cord straps and apparently conquered an entire dimension. How he managed this is a mystery, seeing as how every attempt to conquer Earth was thwarted by four genetic freaks and their [[paparazzi]] [[women|bimbo]].

His actual body looks fleshy and [[retard]]ed. He built a [[robot]] version of it, but instead of putting himself in the robot's head, he put himself in the robot's crotch.

====Bebop and Rocksteady====
Shredder's retarded henchmen, one with the head of a rhino, one with the head of a warthog. Much like the Turtles being named after dead Eurofag [[artist]]s, they are both named after shit genres of 80s [[music]].

===Rat King===
Rat king is a bandage man who think he a is rat, but like to fuck Splinter in front of the turtles.

2003 cartoon he a cyborg clone of bishop, after getting fuck by the turtles and Splinter he became a fur fag.

===Bishop===
A crazy government agent who think everybody on earth is an aliens, he need to fuck everyone on earth to make sure there no aliens     

==The Comic Book==

A. Most fans of the Ninja Turtles really didn't give a shit about the comic book but comic nerds get [[butthurt]] because the series didn't follow the comics. It appears the creators of the show had other intentions like actually making money and not appeasing [[basement dwellers]] who only change their underwear when the Comic-con is in town

B. [[what|The pieces of shits that were the fans of the 87 cartoon city were too afraid of reading these comics, as they were afraid that they would rape their child hood that what they knew was a lie. they were so worried about this that they got butt'nailed by their hermaphrodite of a mother that they forget that their show was such a piece of crap, that they thought that Beebop and Rocksteady were GODS, and that the technodrome was actually a threat instead of the faggot disco ball that it truely was!!!!]]

==Movies==
[[Image:Lolzturtle.gif|thumb|Where's the party, dude?]]

===The First One===
In 1990, [[Faggot|Corey Feldman]] would attempt to summon [[Satan]] by making a live-action Ninja Turtles [[movie]]. However, he only succeeded in contracting [[AIDS]], and soon after died. Everyone, even [[your mom]], saw the movie. Few hate it, most love it. Notable scenes include the Turtles gang-raping April, Michelangelo teaching kids to not leave tips to Pizza delivery boys, Leonardo watching Raphael while he takes a bath, Casey Jones going [[insane]] due to claustrophobia, and the Shredder being defeated by a garbage truck. Tragically, every child that saw the movie when it was first released was given [[AIDS]], transferred through the eyes.

===The Sequel, Secret of the [[Cum|Ooze]]===
A Sequel with [[The Simpsons|Butterfingers]], [[Donut]]s, [[Vanilla Ice]], an [[Asian]] pizza delivery boy, and a rabid Alf was released afterwords. The movie, while not as good as the first one, achieved popularity due to Vanilla Ice making the [[Ninja]] Rap which is as follows "'''GO NINJA GO NINJA GO, GO NINJA GO NINJA GO, GO GO GO GO'''" [[infinity|infinitum]]. Donatello also goes temporarily [[emo]] in the movie when he realizes he is not [[special]] and his existence is all thanks to some randomly dropped tank of [[acid]]. 

===The Third One, Turtles and [[Japan|Samurais]]===
This one is when they start milking things. The Turtles go back in [[time]] to Samurai periods, and 4 Samurai warriors go to the Turtles time and play [[Pac-Man]] with Casey Jones. The Turtles kill a bunch of [[British]] guys with guns, then kill [[Japanese]] guys with guns, then everyone goes back to their own time. They used this shitty idea because they'd already killed off Shredder twice. When they were writing the end of the first movie they thought, "We should kill the Shredder!" Upon deciding to make a second movie, they decided that Shredder could have survived. When they wrote the end of that one they thought, "Let's kill the Shredder, again! Because it's not like he's their only enemy and we're not corporate whores trying to suck this franchise dry! We wouldn't possibly want to make another sequel...wait...fuck." Hence, the third movie.

===The 2007 Movie===
The new 2007 movie uses no Live Action guys in suits, however it uses [[CGI]]. The whole movie is just Raphael and Leonardo having an angsty emo argument, the other two Turtles are in the background, the whole movie drowned out by [[punk]] music. [[AIDS]] was unleashed yet again, people saw it in theaters but because it was full of [[emo]] [[faggotry]], no one bought the DVD.
The movie also brought upon tcest, thanks to the emo gay faggotry of Leo and Raph.

==Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation==
Live-action and aired on [[Fox]] but no Shredder, no April, and there's a girl turtle named Venus Di Milo, because [[No girls on the internet|no Renaissance artists were girls]] or something (don't let the [[Furry|Gureilla Girls]] hear that!). The show was so lame they had to do a [[crossover]] with [[Power Rangers]], because the latter were still getting ratings.

==Video Games==
[[Image:Turtle_pizza_hi.png|thumb|"HEY PLAYER WHO HAS LESS HEALTH THAN ME, YOU WANT THIS PIZZA?"]]

A bunch of video games were made for the NES, SNES, Game Boy, and arcade. Their goodness ranges from [[shit]] to "WOO! FUCK YEAH!" That one where they're time traveling is fucking [[awesome]].

The majority of the gameplay consisted of beating up purple [[foot]] soldiers that exploded and watching your friend grab a pizza that you need more than they do.

==2003 Series==
Since it's the [['80s]] kids' turn to have their childhoods thoroughly [[raped]], someone at [[4Kids]] decided to make a new Ninja Turtles series. This caused many [[fantards]] to flood the [[internets]] with complaints, clogging [[at least 100]] tubes in the process. Since the series sucked so hard, they did what everyone does when something sucks hard: send them into the future to suck even harder. In this series, Shredder was Ch'rell ([[????]]) and he had a daughter called Karai who took it in the pussy from Leonardo, up the ass from Raphael, and in the mouth from Michelangelo. This love pentagon unfortunately left poor Donatello in a homosexual relationship with his best friend Leatherhead.  [[Japan]] decided to take the series and dub it, all the way before things go to the future (yes, Japan dubs our cartoons as we do [[anime|theirs]]). Since the show was full of 4kids [[faggotry]], the Japanese decided to use special comic book effects and other stuff to make it seem better than it is but few people bought it, so the Japanese ended up making it [[Naruto]]-like.

==Nickelodeon Takes Over==
As of now, [[Nickelodeon]] has purchased the rights to Ninja Turtles which will either result in an [[epic]] new relaunch of the series or send the toitles' popularity back down to the shitter. To be frank, it's happened [http://www.x-entertainment.com/articles/0708/ before]...[http://www.x-entertainment.com/articles/0746/ twice]. Since Viacom has a tendency to ruin [[MTV|whatever]] it [[owns]] for [[money|ratings]]...well, you get the picture. The original creators sold out to the unholy media conglomerate that to this day, still cries [[DMCA|foul]] for anyone putting their favorite [[Spongebob]], [[Faggotry|Real World]] and now '''[[acronym|TMNT]]''' episodes on [[YouTube]].
