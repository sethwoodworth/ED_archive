Normandy
[[Image:Hahaoatmeal.jpg|thumb|Man, [[ilu]] [[TOW]].]]
'''The Normandy''' is a [[trolling]] technique based on the following philosophy: ''attack what they least expect you to attack''. This technique was invented by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, or, rather, one of the military aides from which Eisenhower stole all of his ideas before passing them off as his own. Now that [[Germany]] is run by [[communism|communists]], [[Jews]], and [[16-year-old girls|girls]], [[Wikipedia]] has become the target of choice for the Normandy technique.

==Tips==

First, find a non-controversial Wikipedia article - this means you should avoid anything dealing with [[Israel]], [[JEWS DID WTC|Jews doing 9/11]], [[United States|Amerikkka and its imperialistic excursions]], [[Noam Chomsky]], or other Jew-related matters. Oatmeal, for instance, is a good article for our purposes, since Jews do not eat oatmeal, or at any rate do not control the international oatmeal trade... yet.

Next, [[rape]] the fuck out of the oatmeal article, as shown in the diagram to the right.

Now, continually press the refresh button on your browser to make sure that the [[Jimbo Wales|Wikipedos]] have not yet reverted your vandalism. Giggle every time you do this.

Note that a direct assault on an article might be a little obvious. Good ways to cover your tracks are making actual useful edits immediately afterwords, making very small changes, or expanding stubs while hiding [[goatse|hilarity]] in the entry.

==Historical Basis==

The Invasion of Normandy took place in 1973 on the shimmering coasts of Guatemala. American battleships pounded the shores much like a thirteen-year-old pounds his meat to loli. Much of the artillery fire came from the S.S. ''East Clintwood'' and the S.S. ''Loveboat'', both of which were outfitted with really, really awesome plasma cannons, which would later re-appear in the ''Starship Troopers'' films. Historians agree that the Nazis got butt-hurt.
