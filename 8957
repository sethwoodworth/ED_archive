Welfare
{{finalsolutions}}

'''Welfare''' is an often debated system between [[liberals]] and [[conservatives]], both of whom despite never reading the actual bill that describes it, decide that they understand it and have [[Unwarranted Self Importance|an opinion about it that the whole world needs to hear]].

==The Conservative View==

Welfare is a [[liberal]] conspiracy to incentivize laziness and de-motivate our workforce by offering [[Lie |extremely tempting and livable cash hand outs]] to poor people [[Truth|who don’t deserve it]]. [[Fact|Everyone knows that being poor is a choice, much like being a fag, that every nigger and illegal immigrant makes during adolescence]]. 

==The Liberal View== 

Welfare is a system to redistribute wealth to the poor, ([[Lie|through absolutely no fault of their own]]), [[Niggers|struggling minorities]],[[Niggers| homeless people]], and [[Fags|starving musicians]] get back on their feet to free them from the shackles of [[the man]] for the coming revolution. 

==Welfare Timeline==

*1935: The first social security bill containing the deranged fetus of what we call Welfare today is birthed
*1950’s: Everyone piles on the welfare train
*1960’s: Everyone else piles on the welfare train; [[conservatives]] everywhere are [[butthurt]] that [[niggers]] are getting money (and rights LULZ).
*1973: Nixon trolls welfare by making it even more complicated and retarded in a feeble attempt to scare the niggers away 
*1996: Blowjob bill makes welfare less about [[Shit was so cash|shit being so cash]] and more about [[Shit no one cares about|working and children]]. Subsequently, the percentage of niggers on welfare dropped [[over 9000]]. 

==What it actually is==

Welfare came about because America had tons of [[white guilt]] over one of the lulziest event in American history known as [[slavery]].  Since [[Niggers]] hate working they took advantage of the white guilt and got welfare passed.  Niggers have [[rape|taken advantage]] of this [[bullshit|system]] and are still [[butthurt|pissed off]] about [[slavery]] and how the [[W|white man]] is keeping them down.

==Social Security==

{{Quote|we'll leave this to the next generation...|every generation on Social Security}}

Social Security is best known for being that large chunk of money you see taken off your paystubs every week that goes into a bottomless pit which you’ll use later on at the slot machines at the local red man's casino. The basic idea is that you pay into this fund as you work, and when you retire, you can start taking back what you paid to the fund as you worked. [[Troll|Oh and spoiler alert: it’s about to go bankrupt]]. 

Yes indeed, somehow Americunts somehow managed to fuck up what could have been one of the simplest programs in the world: Put money in, wait thirty years as interest covers inflation, take back money, great success. But no, the politicians and the [[Jews]] decided to fuck the life out of every aspect of the program by over complicating the shit out of it, once again taking a shit on the lives of middle class America. It is also well known that Congress has been using the money put into social security to fund their late night strip parties and heroin addictions for the past entirety of its existence. Only recently, as the [[Lie|unforeseeable]] generation of baby boomers [[Lie|all of the sudden]] began to retire, politicians promptly realized that they had spent all of the money, but didn't give a shit because they're already filthy rich and don't need social security. The solution? The program has begun shoveling out more money in benefits than it has gained from its taxes, once again passing the flaming bag of dog shit for the next generation to fuck up and follow suit. 

Interestingly enough, this is the only form of social welfare that the [[Tea Party]] endorses, despite it being government mandating money fucking, because every single one of them is roughly 100 years old and living off the dying fund. It is also the only program that is essentially nigger-proof, as it requires the collector to have held down a job for more than an hour, which only makes it look sweeter to the tea baggers.

==Welfare Fraud==

You’d think this would be pretty difficult huh? Well fuck off [[you]] liberal hippy, this is what niggers and [[Mexicans]] all across our great country are doing to steal your money.

*1. Apply for welfare 
*2. Claim you have [[over 9000]] childrens 
*3. ????
*4. PROFIT

==The Tea Party and Welfare==
[[Image:Welfarestates2.gif|thumb|right|Conservatives sure hate welfare]]
{{Quote|Indonesian Muslim turned Welfare thug,|Mark Williams on Barack Hussein Obama}}

Contrary to popular belief, Tea Party activists are strong advocates for welfare and unemployment aid. Often misunderstood, these patriotic Americans believe it is their duty to serve the poor and help level the playing fields for the lesser fortunate members of society.

{{Quote|I just don't think its fair, many of these men and women are born into this abject poverty without even a fighting chance to make in today's turbulent economy. We in America need to let go of our primal greed and see that there are people who have never known the luxury of a home or family who just need a caring hand to lift them to their feet.| I made every word of this up, but it is absolutely what they would say}} 

{{Quote|The tea party position to "end the bailouts" for example is just silly.  Bailouts are just big money welfare and isn't that what we want all Coloreds to strive for?  What kind of racist would want to end big money welfare?  What they need to do is start handing the bail outs directly to us coloreds!|Mark William's famous nigger impression}}
