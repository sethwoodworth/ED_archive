Blasphemy Challenge
The '''Blasphemy Challenge''' is an ongoing [[YouTube]] drama where neckbearded atheists say on camera that they don't believe in [[God]] and post their videos on the [http://www.blasphemychallenge.com/ blasphemychallenge.com] website.

It started when the [[Rational Response Squad]] told [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7QVbJnSPQE some faggot] to make a YouTube video offering people a free DVD if they said on camera that they denied the Holy Spirit, which [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVIDIUKVcyw according to his video] is the most unforgivable sin in [[Christianity]]. Like [[Real_life|Real Life]] atheists, [[YouTube]] atheists can't go for 5 seconds without trolling Christians. As much as trolling Christians [[for the lulz]] is a commendable activity, the Blasphemy Challenge videos were woefully bereft of lulz.

The stupidest aspect of the Blasphemy Challenge is that although its stated purpose was to spread the Good Word of Atheism, they only gave out the DVD (''The God who Wasn't There'', about the supposed non-existence of Jesus even as a historical figure) to people who actually took the challenge and "denied" the Holy Spirit, i.e people who already agreed with everything on the DVD and probably owned it already. Thus, it's not hard to deduce that the "Challenge" was less about atheists bravely taking a stand against the superstitions of Christianity and more about them stroking their own fragile, fragile egos.

== [[Violetkitty411]]'s Response ==
True to her [[crazy|batshit insane]], [[conservative]], [[Christian]] upbringing, ViloletKitty411 decided to "stand up" and preach ridiculous biblical bullshit. She pulled out the tired old Pascal's Wager, which was subsequently blown apart as easily as the Twin Towers. (For those who don't know, the reason why Pascal's Wager is an inadmissible hypothesis when used to illustrate the  legitimacy of '''believing''' in invisible super beings, is simply because Pascal was '''known''' beyond a shadow of a doubt to be a Jew).
