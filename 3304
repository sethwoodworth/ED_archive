'''Get A New Daddy''' is a lulzy [[song]] set to {{youtube|vJCRNXUngAM|an even lulzier music video}} by the [[SNL|sketch comedy group]] ''The Whitest Kids U'Know''. What sets it apart from their other work is the fact that it, like "[[Sparkling Wiggles]]", causes [[liberal]] [[faggots]] on [[YouTube]] to get [[butthurt]] and post [[retarded]], [[melodramatic]] comments like "THIS IS [[Sick fuck|SICK]]" and "THIS GUY SHOULD BE PUT IN [[Jail|JAIL]]."

== Synopsis ==

Basically the song is about kids telling their teachers that their shitty father is a [[pedo]] so he will [[V&|go to jail]] and they can "get a new daddy". It includes step-by-step instructions on how to pull it all off too, such as kids taking pictures of their own genitals and leaving the photos in daddy's desk. Clearly the song is hilarious, but not nearly as hilarious as how pissed off the YouTube [[faggots]] are about it. They actually think that kids are going to find the video and follow its advice, which would probably be the ultimate [[lulz]] if it ever happened.
