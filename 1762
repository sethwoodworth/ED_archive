Cop-out
[[category:stub]]
{{stub}}
Since the dawn of time, there has existed many [[pussy|pussies]] behind the mask of a well-knowledged [[dumbass|intellectual]]. [[IRL]], a typical cop-out is "[[What-EVER]]" mainly due to the fact that the person (or ''persons'') know that they've been either proven wrong and wish to not have their [[owned|feelings hurt]] any more, '''OR''' they do not wish to have their [[Mortal_Kombat|ass kicked]]. Proceeding to do either/or will bring about maximum [[lulz]] as would-be intellectuals expect this trump to get them out of damn-near any situation.

[[Internets|Online]], on the other hand - behind the safety of their computer monitor - people have made various, stereotypical "cop-outs" to declare [[300|victory over something they've either clearly lost, or there was nothing to ever win]].


==Internet Cop-outs==

'''"LOL @ [...]"''' A typical cop-out used by your everyday online [[pussy_troll|smart-guy]] or [[psychologist]] is "LOL @ [...]" While [[not|mildly intimidating]], it's easy to break down their attempt at an insult.

*[[ALLCAPS|LOL]] ("''I'm [[butthurt]]''"; caplocks in a debate insinuates just that) + [[Elite|@]] ("''I use [[netspeak|online ebonics]]''"; automatically deludes intelligence) + (''[[Not_funny|whatever they find hilarious]]'').

On a side-note, [[lol]] alone is used as a wild card to keep the other guessing as to what they actually find humor in. Or, of course, they have nothing else to type.

'''"[[Nice_try|G.G.]]"''' It means, "''good game.''" This is to declare victory over the aforementioned debate that was never possible to win for either parties. Like all trump cards, it's played early by those who don't want their [[E-go]] hurt.

'''"[[Intellectual checkmate]]"''' Commonly used by [[4chan|channers]] in a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] manner to mock both Smugfag and whoever they're claiming victory over. While it isn't actually a cop-out, to the [[newfag|naked eye]], the person will seemingly be forcing victory.

'''"[[NO U]]"''' The above mentioned applies, as well, however it's used to ''mock'' a person's statement which counters their own '''or''' is just plain stupid and child's play. Example:

* Guy # 1: Wow, you're stupid.
* Guy # 2: You're dumb.
* Guy # 1: NO U!!

Needless to say, Guy # 2 feels pretty stupid right about now ...

'''"[[Own|OWNED]]!"''' Usually spewed after an insult is projected or the person has regained some form of ground in the debate or situation. Commonly used by gamers, geeks, and people who spend too much time away from reality. While originally [[l33t]], Internet tough guys have adapted to using this phrase. Other variations of the word are ... well, basically any misspelling of the word, and replacing the O with a P.

'''"Anti-argument Clich√©s"''' These repetitive, [[old meme|worn out]] lines are:
* ''"Don't argue with an unintelligent person. They will only drag you down to their level and beat you at their own game"
* "''Arguing on the Internet is like the running in the special olympics [...]''"
* "''[[Tylor King|JUST IGNORE DEM]]''!"

'''"[[Al Sharpton|IT'S CUZ I'Z BLACK!]]"''' This is the most common cop-out you will hear when arguing with someone of the charcoal persuasion, no matter the topic. Typical conversation where you might hear this cop-out:

*Normal Dude: ...then, you'll take the first road on the left leading to White Plains, NY.
*Rodney King: WHY IT GOTTA BE WHITE?! [[George Bush doesn't care about black people|JORGE BUSH HATEZ TEH BLAKS!]]
*Normal Dude: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...wtf?

'''"[[Conservapedia|Typical liberal temper-tantrum]]"''' [[Andrew Schlafly]]'s secret weapon.  Deployed on anyone who suggests that Obama might not actually be a senior member of al-Qaeda.  Best when used when your opponent is being completely reasonable and you're bawww'ing into [[Phyllis Schlafly|your mother]]'s bosom.
