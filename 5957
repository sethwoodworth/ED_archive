One fateful night during a repeat of [[The OC]], a vapid, ill-fated [[16 year old girl]] was furiously masturbating with that week's issue of ''People'' magazine shoved up her yeast-infected snatch. (Remember to wash those dirty fingernails, ladies!) Immediately as she [[queef]]ed onto her living room carpet, a hideous creature was spawned from the juices... OH NO THEY DIDNT!

In their neverending quest to both ignore the [[fact]] that they have [[no life|no lives]] outside of growing their embarrassing [[friends list]], as well as pretending they know people who are famous, the [[fugly]] and morbidly [[fat|obese]] [[16 year old girls]] who populate this community usually involve themselves in somber discussions and the dissection of some of the greatest mysteries of our time, such as the pregnancy of [[Brotney Spears]], the fluctuating weight of [[Lindsay Lohan]] and [[Nicole Ritchie]], and the on-going adventures of [[Paris Hilton]]'s cooch. 

The members of this community pride themselves in being "snarky" and "brutal". A typical post of the day is an ordinary paparazzi shot of [[Brotney Spears]] and her ugly husband, merely walking down the street. This provokes dozens of pages of comments with such brilliant and witty banter as "ew", "omg ew", "sHe iz soooo faTt!!!" and "sHe iz sooooo tRasHy!!!!". HAHAHAHHA! Take that, Brotney! That'll show her! 

The community is moderated by a couple of tragic [[emo]] [[queen]]s and some random [[MySpace]] [[whore]]s who delude themselves into thinking that their lives have meaning by posting long-winded entries about themselves. If you want to avoid being [[ban]]ned, simply scream "OMG I WANT 2 HAVE U R BABIES MODS", compose lengthy comments on how they are "[[teh]] best [[EVAR]]" and get ready to growl down on dirty [[Scenewhore|scenester]] [[pu55y|snatch]]/[[mangina]].  Wanting to suck Lady Gaga's cock is also a plus.  <strike>S</strike>he totally has one.

In order to fit in to this community, you MUST have a [[internet disease|blurry]] [[camwhore]] [[icon]] of your [[n00dz|naked]], nubile [[pedophile|underage]] body, so people can pretend they know you. Scratch that, 90% of the community's members are now too ugly to have their picture taken, the new ''in vogue'' thing is to have a [[Sarcasm|sarcastic]] [[icon]] like an out of frame sceenshot with a [[fail|lulzy]] caption or an animated [[GIF]]. Some of the most brave ones use conservative [[Party Hard]] icons.

Also, do join their [[9000|many]] [[retarded]] off-topic communities, now with more [[pr0n]]! And make sure you look and act as feminine and girly as possible! This particular community detests [[lesbian|bulldykes]] or any member of the [[female]] gender who does not wear makeup, has terrible skin, or who is even slightly under- or overweight. Didn't you realize? Women are utterly worthless if they don't dress up and look attractive for [[men]] 24/7.

==BREAKING NEWS OMG==
29/01/09 ONTD crashed [[LJ]] again with over [[9000|16,199,244]] comments. [[LJ]] explodes since they weren't ready for 16 millions of comments. ONTD is sad.

February 5th 2009 ONTD returns back to business but not before it puked up [[over 9000]] old comments from [[last thursday]].

==ONTD IN THE MEDIA==
[[Image:OHNOTHEYDIDNot.jpg|thumb|OH NO THEY DIDNT GIRL FRIEND]]
Oh No They Didn't! has been name dropped, shout outed, and blacklisted [[at least 100]] times by many prominent historical figures, for example [[Oprah Winfrey]] 
in her magazine [[your mom|O]]. Most recently, they pwned Rich Cronin of 90's pop sensation LFO.

In the [[Playboy|Playboy]] March '09 music issue in which Lily Allen appeared she was asked Q: You have become a public figure outside of music, too. Do you ever check celebrity gossip sites? To which she answered A: ''I check one site called OhNoTheyDidnt. It's on livejournal, and people just upload stuff themselves. It's not like [[Perez_hilton|Perez Hilton]], it's his views on things. I don't care what he has to say. I just like looking at pictures and drawing my own conclusions. This site doesn't have an opinion on things.'' Members of ONTD were very heartbroken about the last bit but mostly very [[Jizz|excited]].

==ONTD SELLS OUT==
On April 2, 2010, ONTD's massive cock was too much for LJ to take, resulting in ads being placed all over the site to accommodate.  Many a butthurt was had, and all the cries of the little people went unheeded (unless replied to sarcastically by the holier-than-thou mods).

==WIKI DELETED==
A Wikipedia page (Who'd thought they'd even have one?) was decidedly taken down after the ONTD members trolled all over it for the umpteenth time, having first been locked because the residential members of Wikipedia were maddened by the irresponsible shit posted on the site.

Reason for deletion: "nonnotable" AKA bitches don't deserve the fucking page

Score: Wikipedia- 1; ONTD- (in their minds: 6 billion) zero.

Date: Between 26-27th August 2010
