Every [[Weaboo]] down in Weaboo-ville Liked camwhores a lot...<br>
But the W.T. Snacks, Who lived just North of Weaboo-ville, Did NOT!

The WT Snacks hated camwhores! The whole camwhore season!<br>
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.<br>
It could be that his head wasn't screwed on quite right.<br>
It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.<br>
But I think that the most likely reason of all<br>
May have been that his PENIS was two sizes too small.<br>

But, whatever the reason, his dick or his shoes,<br>
He stood there on Midnight Snacks, hating the Weaboos,<br>
Staring down from his radio, while music he'd mix<br>
At the flash-bulb lit mirrors in their camwhoring pics.<br>
For he knew every Weaboo down in Weaboo-ville below<br>
Was busy now, shouting, "[[TITS OR GTFO]]."<br>

"And they're posting their Togi-chan!" he snarled with a sneer.<br>
"Tomorrow is 5 mil [[GET]]! It's practically here!"<br>
Then he growled, with his WT Snacks fingers nervously drumming,<br>
"I MUST find a way to keep camwhores from coming!"<br>

For, tomorrow, he knew... All the Weaboo boys posting IN [[ALL CAPS]]<br>
Would wake up bright and early. They'd start posting their traps!<br>
And then! Oh, the fags! Oh, the fags! Fags! Fags! Fags!<br>
That's one thing he hated! The FAGS! FAGS! FAGS! FAGS!<br>

Then the Weaboos, young and old, would post in a sticky. And they'd post!<br>
And they'd post! And they'd POST! POST! POST! POST!<br>
They would start with holy freaking crap, and copypastaing dumb shit<br>
Which was something the WT Snacks couldn't stand, even one bit.<br>

And THEN, they'd do something he liked least of all!<br>
Every Weaboo down in Weaboo-ville, the tall and the small,<br>
Would stand close together, with harbls all stiff<br>
They'd stand with balls touching, and the Weaboos would start to yiff!<br>
They'd [[yiff]]! And they'd yiff! AND they'd [[Furfaggotry|YIFF! YIFF! YIFF! YIFF!]]<br>

And the more the WT Snacks thought of the Weaboo-furry-yiffing<br>
The more the WT Snacks thought, "I must stop this whole thing!<br>
"Why for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!<br>
I MUST stop Furry Friday from coming!... But HOW?"<br>

Then he got an idea! [[/b/|An awful idea!]]<br>
THE WT SNACKS GOT A WONDERFUL, [[Something Awful|SOMETHING AWFUL]] IDEA!<br>

"I know just what to do!" The WT Snacks laughed in his throat.<br>
And he made a quick Renamon hat and a coat.<br>
And he chuckled, and clucked, "What great [[Lulz|Snacksy tricks!]]<br>
"With this coat and this hat, I'll look just like those dicks!"<br>

"All I need is a [[fursona]]..." The WT Snacks looked around.<br>
But since he wasn't a furfag, there was naught to be found.<br>
Did that stop the old WT Snacks...? No! The WT Snacks simply said,<br>
"If I can't act like a furry, I'll find one instead!"<br>
So he found Sage Freehaven, who had started a thread<br>
And he wrote with red letters, "[[BANNED]]" on his head.<br>

Then, someone uploaded some furry, and [[CP]] to boot<br>
So WT Snacks ran off to tell Doug.<br>

Then Doug had no choice, and started to ban,<br>
And WT Snacks shouted, "[[Party van]]!"<br>

All their threads were gone. (Marked for deletion, old).<br>
All the Weaboos kept posting, who hadn't been told,<br>
WT Snacks sat alone at his computer. "This is phase number one," The old WT Snacks hissed<br>
And he logged in to the server, to find the ban list.<br>

Then he saved the list, and [[Proxy|covered his tracks]],<br>
If hackers could do it, then so could WT Snacks.<br>
He got MySQL error only once, for a moment or two.<br>
And he thought to himself, about what he planned to do.<br>
Where the little Weaboo furries all hung out, fappers in tow.<br>
"These furries," he grinned, "are the first things to go!"

Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unnerving,<br>
And banned people at random, even those undeserving!<br>
For CP! And [[it's a trap|traps]] Invasions of forum!<br>
Racist cartoons! Politics! Commenting on a sticky's decorum!<br>
And he banned them in droves. Then the WT Snacks, very nimbly,<br>
Perma-banned all the furries, one by one. [[Diabeetus|Wilford Brimley!]]

Then he slunk to the site directory. He deleted some boards!<br>
He deleted the /h/entai, upsetting the hordes!<br>
He cleaned out that website, he even got /f/lash.<br>
Why, that WT Snacks even put /d/ in the trash!

Then he spammed all the boards, and lagged them, with glee.<br>
"And NOW!" grinned the WT Snacks, "I will fag up the /b/!"

And the WT Snacks altered the /b/, and he started to shove<br>
[[ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH|Annoying music]] and backgrounds in, all of the above.<br>
But he turned around fast, and he saw a small Weaboo!<br>
Little Cindy-Lou Doug, be the little girl, he had wanted to screw.<br>

The WT Snacks had been caught by this little Weaboo fag<br>
The one normally responsible for the server's bad lag.<br>
She stared at the WT Snacks and said, "Snacks, why,<br>
"Why are you destroying our /b/? WHY?"<br>

But, you know, that old WT Snacks was so smart and so slick<br>
He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!<br>
"Why, my sweet little tot," the WT Snacks lied,<br>
"There's a thread on this board that's out of line on one side.<br>
"So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear.<br>
"I'll [[chemo|fix it up]] there. Then I'll bring it back here."<br>

And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head<br>
And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.<br>
And when Cindy-Lou Doug went to bed with her cup,<br>
He went to the control panel and fucked the /b/ up!<br>

Then the last thing he did as 4chan's esquire<br>
Was blame it on Anonymous Mod, the old liar.<br>
On their boards he left nothing at all. He [[kill it with fire|killed it with fire!]]

And the one speck of hentai that he left on the servers<br>
Was a thumbnail that was even too small for /h/ perverts.<br>
Then, he did the same thing, to the other Weaboo [[*chans]]<br>
Leaving thumbnails much too small for the other Weaboos' plans!<br>

It was quarter past dawn... All the Weaboos, still a-bed<br>
All the Weaboos, still a-snooze, when he sighed, cradling his head,<br>
He had deleted their torrents! The pictures! The trappings!<br>
The fags! And the furries! He had put a stop to their fappings!<br>

Three million posts up! Up the post count of /b/,<br>
He deleted it all, it was up there to see!<br>
"Pooh-pooh to the Weaboos!" he was Snack-ish-ly humming.<br>
"They're finding out now that nobody is cumming!<br>
"They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!<br>
"Their mouths will hang open a minute or two<br>
"Then all the Weaboos on /b/ will all cry [[BAWWWWW|BOO-HOO!]]"<br>

"That's a noise," grinned the WT Snacks, "That I simply must hear!"<br>
So he paused. And the WT Snacks put a hand to his ear.<br>
And he did hear a sound rising over the TCP/IP.<br>
It started in low. Then it started to grow...<br>

But the sound wasn't sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!<br>
It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!<br>

He stared down at Weaboo-ville! The WT Snacks popped his eyes!<br>
Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!<br>

Every Weaboo down in Weaboo-ville, the tall and the small,<br>
Was fapping! Without any hentai at all!<br>
He HADN'T stopped Weaboos from cumming! [[I Came|THEY CAME!]]<br>
Somehow or other, they came just the same!<br>

And the WT Snacks, with his Snacks-feet ice-cold in the snow,<br>
Stood puzzling and puzzling: "How could it be so?<br>
They came without [[loli]]! They came without [[rape]]!<br>
"They came without tentacles, [[cum|cumshots]] or [[Final Fantasy|Quistis Treipe]]!"<br>
And he puzzled three hours, til his puzzler was sore.<br>
Then the WT Snacks thought of something he hadn't before!<br>
"Maybe fapping," he thought, "doesn't come from porn.<br>
"Maybe fapping... perhaps... means a little bit more!"<br>

And what happened then...? Well...in Weaboo-ville they say<br>
That the WT Snack's small [[PENIS]] grew three sizes that day!<br>
And the minute his balls didn't feel quite so tight,<br>
He jizzed with his load through the bright morning light<br>
And he brought back the porn! And the lube for his pistol!<br>
And he... HE HIMSELF!... WT Snacks fapped to [[Krystal]]!<br>
