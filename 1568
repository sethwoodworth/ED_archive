{{an hero}}

'''Christopher Foster''' became [[an hero]] on the 1st of [[9/11|September]] because of [[fail|failing]] to meet payments for his house and business. But before killing himself and burning down his multi-million pound mansion, he decided to [[pwn]] his [[bestiality|horses and dogs]], including his wife and teenage daughter; which is the equivalent. [[Anon]] physicists are analysing the data in order to effectively create a vaccine rendering dogs useless. Work on curtains remains slow.

Police at first believed it was [[Anarchy|arsonists]] who burned the house, but with the help of [[America|Amerkins]], they soon found out it was a plot by Jew terrorists who [[never forget|did 9/11]]. It was soon after that discovery that led to the discovery that [[Jews]] made Christopher Foster bankrupt, and caused the recession of whole countries and nations.

== Christopher Foster ==
Mr. Foster was [[at least 100 years ago|at least 100 years old]] and was also a [[fat|fatass]] like his wife '''Jillian'''. He was once blackmailed many years ago. Mr Foster was managing director of [[lemonparty|Ulva Ltd]] ([[wtf]]?). The company was running out of [[money|moneyz]], and they had gotten sued the year before. 

That is when the [[pwnage]] began.

He used his hunting rifle, which had the silencer on (so that he couldn't be seen by UAVs), to kill the family's two dogs, three horses. He also killed a [[cow]] and a [[bitch]]. After this epic killstreak he called in a Tactical Nuke and ended it all. 

Thus, [[lulz]] ensued.

== Jillian Foster ==
No one really gives a [[shit]] about '''Jillian Foster''', most of the attention goes to their [[dead]] [[whore|daughter]]. We do know, though, that Jillian Foster was the secretary for her husband's company and was a [[lolcow|fat cow]], so was bound to end up dead with fat blocking her arteries anyway.

== Kirstie Foster ==
'''Kirstie Foster''', before being [[pwn|pwnt]] by her father was [[whore|popular]] at school. Her classmates will remember her as a [[lie|kind, loving individual who was always fun to be with]]. Well, when you had as much money as this [[16 year old girl|not-quite-16-yr-old-girl]] had, she was bound to be "popular". The [[you|fat loser]] of her classes, however, will remember her as a snot-nosed [[bitch]] who deserved to die and in that her death will give them many [[lulz]] over the years, and that her death was [[death|revenge]] for acting like a [[paris hilton|spoilt bitch who thought she was better than everyone.]] According to [[Tabloid|The Sun]] newspaper, Kirstie was [[headshot|executed]] by her father as she whoring herself to 50 year old men on [[Bebo]]. Once again, proof if proof be needed that [[Sam Leeson|Bebo kills]]. In a classic case of '[[Missing white woman syndrome]]', every single self absorbed fucktard on Facebook has made a group dedicated to her memory, ignoring her Mother and the poor little animals.

[[Image:Fuckdonotwantacne.jpg|thumb|[[Fucking]] [[gross]] [[acne|pizza face]]. Also WHAT IS THAT FESTERING THING ON HER EAR!?]]

== Faggots & Comments ==
There have been a lot of [[pussies]] and [[faggots]] (who didn't know the Fosters' and are mostly from [[Failbook]]), and yet have decided to create [[gay|tributes]] and [[goatse|shit]]. More [[drama whore|caring individuals]] also decide to leave comments with [[grammar nazi|bad spelling and grammar]]; [[fact|Some people can't even be fucked to learn the names of the people who died]]. ([http://www.new.facebook.com/home.php#/topic.php?uid=26259451380&topic=5720 Proof is here]). [[all caps|ALL TRIBUTES ARE MADE FOR KIRSTIE, BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE DIED]][[oneoneone|!1!!11!!!1one!!]] Though all the people that have left comments are [[assburgers|mentally retarded]], they leave comments <s>to make themselves feel better</s> [[lolwut|<s>out of the goodness of their hearts]].</s> because their microscopic genitalia make it so they have no other choice.

== The [[Butthurt]] ==
Upon discovering [[Christopher Foster|this article]], many people became [[butthurt]] from the trolling of the tributes (all practically to [[whore|Kirstie]]) and tried to delete it. [[serious business|Sadly]], those people suffer from [[assburgers]] and don't realise [[ED]] is [[win]] and they [[fail|fail miserably at life]], which therefore causes them to go to [[Faecesbook]] to pay tribute to a [[lol|dead girl]].

[[Moar]] [[lulz]] resulted as one of the followers of the [[cult]] decided that he would try and [[rape]] the trolls and, as planned he had an [[epic fail]]. There were also plenty of [[lie|wimmin who were on the internets]] [[baw|baaaawwwing]] about how people [[respect|HAZ NO RESPEKTS NEMORE!!]] Instead of being [[in the kitchen]], cooking and/or cleaning like they were [[bible|made to do]].

Blinded by the light that is pure [[win]], the butthurt masses of the the differing Kirstie fan clubs decided enough was enough and vowed to bring down teh sick and evil website once and for all. They formed [[butthurt|another]] failbook group to spread this message to the masses.

Ways to get rid of ED include:

*Crying to [[Tony Blair|Local MPs]].
*Crying in general.
*More crying.
*[[fail|Vandalising this article]]
*???
*PROFIT!

8/9/2008 - Group founded. ED lol'd.
11/2/2009 - ED still exists. Oh well.

== Furry Family ==
It was widely known among the Foster's community that they were <s>[[sick fucks]]</s> [[IRL]] [[furry|furries]]. Robert Doley, [[Christopher Foster]]'s brother had announced, that "Kirsty is horse-mad, and so is Jill. They'd filled the place with animals, they'd got sheep, horses, dogs, ducks, guinea pigs, special breeds of chickens. *Jill even had an incubator and hatched out some duck eggs herself this year. For Chris's 50th birthday this year she got him three sheep as his present."

Although people within the community thought that this was perfectly normal, many people still hold speculations against it, calling the family "disgusting". One person came to the police saying that he had taped the family having sex with their animals, and had blackmailed Christopher in to giving him money. Seeing how the family were bankrupt, however, this led to the family being [[pwnd]].

 *Proof she wanted to breed animals for her [[sick]] needs.
