'''Dead to Rights''' was a 3-D [[nes|Nintendo Entertainment System]] game on the [[PS2]], [[Xbox]] and [[Gay|Kidtendo Gaymecube]].  It was released on August 19, 2002, and dumped into bargain bins on August 20, 2002.

The game was published by Namco, who are known for developing Japanese [[Dating_sim|dating simulators]] and shitting all over Pac-Man's legacy.

Dead to Rights marks [[fail|Namco's first (and final) attempt to embrace the art of Western video games]].

The storyline follows the interspecies relationship of a police officer and his dog, who are falsely accused of murder. On their path to redemption, they kill, like, 17,000 people, but [[irony|nobody seems to care about those particular murders]]. Some other John Woo stuff happens, followed by some [[Grand_Theft_Auto|Grand Theft Auto III]] stuff, and some Max Payne stuff... At the end, you discover that the real murderer actually [[cliche|killed your father]]. That was a spoiler, by the way. I guess you get revenge, or something. The true ending is a mystery since no one bothered to finish it.

The slow-motion sequences prove that Dead to Rights has [[Michael_Bay|ample cinematic flare]], inspired or directly pilfered from Max Payne or, in turn, [[The_Matrix|Asian action films]].

==Characters==

===Jack Slate and Shadow===

Jack Slate is a [[bully|police officer]] in the Grant City Police Department's [[furry|K-9]] division; Shadow is Jack's interspecies life partner whom he met while scouring Craigslist for a [[gay|m4m misc. romance]]. The history of the two is not detailed within the game, but many can [[yiff|devise their own probable fanfiction]]. Jack and Shadow share a [[yiff|fantasy relationship]] that enables [[Unrealistic expectations|communication between the two]]; for example, Jack can command Shadow to do things, such as [[bestiality|suck his cock, or the cock of a foe]].

Both Jack and Shadow, wrongfully convicted of murder, murder their way through the city, trying to clear their names of any wrong doing.

==Gameplay==
Dead to Rights is a third-person [[fps]], where run around and shoot shit until you realize (around the first level) that the game is extremely mediocre.
