{{quote|I don't understand all of the antisemitism on this website. Why must all of you go to such great lengths just to insult the Jewish people? It doesn't make any sense to me. Did we, as a people, ever do anything to you? Did I ever do anything to harm you as an individual? The answer is no. I haven't been looking on this website very long, it was referred to me by a friend of mine because he too found it disgusting.

All of you on this website are Nazis. I see what gets posted here. I will bring you all down if it's the last thing I do. You Nazis are the worst thing on this earth. You are all jealous that God picked the Jews as his chosen people. I'm smarter than every single one of you, and I dare you to try anything against me because I have more legal power than you'll ever know.

The picture is me, and as you can see i'm not fat like you.

Eli Kozin made himself famous [[last thursday]] when he posted his famous quote noted above, criticizing /b/ for making fun of [[jews]]
He failed massively though, by puttin his real email in the email field and giving his real name. He was later pranked by many, many [[anon| anons]] and had [[over 9000]] orders of General Tso's Chicken and Pizza along with Qur'ans, Bibles, Scientologists, tampons, and condoms ordered to his home in Merrick, NY.
He is also the creator of the possible meme [[I HAVE MORE LEGAL POWER THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW]]

Shalom Faggots,

[[Shit_nobody_cares_about|My name is Eli]], and [[Unwarranted_Self_Importance|I am better single one of you.]] [[Truth|All of you are fat, dumb, nazis]] who spend every second of their day looking at anti [[Shit|Semitic]] pictures. You are everything bad in the world and you all have [[Doing_it_wrong|tiny schmeckels]]. Honestly, are any of you even religious? I mean, I guess it's fun making fun of people who are religious, but you just wait till you're burning in hell. You're much worse than most real life Nazis.

Don't be afraid of [[Lie|my superiority]]. Just hit me with your best shot. [[Crap|I'm pretty much perfect]]. I was captain of the debate team, and starter of the Jew Culture Club. What clubs are you in, other than [[Nazi|"make fun of everyone who is better than you"]]? I also get straight A's, and have a brand new Torah (Just read it; Shit was SO shibboleth). You are all anti Semitics who should just repent now and leave God's chosen ones alone. Don't even think of messing with me, [[Fail|I have more legal power than you will ever know]].
