Paranoid Parrot
{{Forced Meme}}
[[File:ParanoidParrot09.jpg|thumb|250px]]
Yet another yawn-inducing variation of the [[At_least_100_years_ago|once funny]] Advice Dog meme, Paranoid Parrot got vigorously posted on /b/ like it was the most original thing since Bj√∂rk. Obviously the result of someone's inability to do anything more imaginative than strap an adjective beginning with 'P' to the word 'Parrot', Paranoid Parrot is yet another example of the rapidly diminishing creativity of /b/'s hive mind; constant exposure to [[Child Porn|CP]] and [[Bestiality|bestiality]] apparently does have consequences.




==The Formula==

The structure of Paranoid Parrot is, predictably, simple. The [[Original_Poster|OP]] posts an image macro of a parrot and states: '''"You Relate, You Lose"''', thus [[Meme_Combining|combining]] the Advice Dog meme with the You Laugh, You Lose meme. The text at the top of the picture describes a normal action or occurrence, and the text at the bottom of the picture relates an over-reaction or paranoid apprehension. Cue a shit-ton of posts saying things like, "You got me", and "All of these apply to me". One of those posts was probably by [[You|you]].
