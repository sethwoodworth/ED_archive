Okami

'''Okami''' is a [[Legend of Zelda|Zelda]]-clone video game published by [[Capcom]]. It was one of the last games made for the [[Playstation 2]] because it sucked so badly that the PS2's reputation never fully recovered, forcing Sony to abandon the platform and its users. In an attempt to turn this great and terrible power of [[failure]] on their competitors, Sony eventually convinced Capcom to release a [[Wii]] version in an attempt to kill off [[Nintendo]]'s console.

==Back Story==
Okami takes place during [[World War II|some point]] in medieval [[Japanese]] [[history]]. The developers originally intended to base the story on Japanese [[mythology]] and [[Hentai|folk legends]], [[Lazy|but decided to give up on their research and just make a bunch of shit up.]]  The story follows a goddess named Amaterasu, who appears on Earth [[Lolwut|as a wolf]] [[Fail|(Beside the face that in real japanese history she had nothing to do with wolves, at all)]] in an attempt to take away a curse by and shitting nature out of her ass. She is assisted by [[ADHD|
Issun,]] a fierce [[Horny|horny]] bug that won't [[STFU]], and [[Faggot|Waka,]] whom [[Stalker|stalks]] Ammy in hopes of engaging in [[bestiality]].

==Crap Art & Game Design==

[[Image:Rao1.jpg|thumb|This is [[the best]] Okami's character design has to offer.]]
Though anyone with [[common sense]] could see that Okami's graphics were smeary and inconsistent from one frame to the next, [[otaku]] across the land had screaming orgasms when seeing the game's art style.  This ought to be unsurprising, since the producer and art director were both [[DevianTART]] moderators before [[Fail|making it big]] in gaming. 

Few saw through Capcom's successful campaign to convince players and critics that incomplete art design and graphics programming was in actuality all about "watercolor-quality visuals influenced by traditional Japanese sumi-e artworks". Director Hideki Kamiya said in an interview:

{{quote|When we were doing the level art, we started talking about how cool it would be to force the players to do the work for us. And the graphics designers started laughing, and agreed with us. From that point on, we never got an hour's worth of work from the art department.

When we released the game, our PR guys did a great job making it seem like a good idea for gamers to have to design images that should have been completed in-house by paid professionals.

Sure, there were complaints. But fuck, man, we were all too busy [[Drugs|doing bong hits and snorting crank]] off the pale, leathery asses of [[Homeless|bag ladies]] to give a shit.| Kamiya - revealing the depth of Capcom's professionalism and attention to detail}}

Originally, plans were made to hire voice actors to portray the characters, but the audio budget had been squandered on crank and bag ladies, so in a panic, sound designers abducted some [[Retard|Down's syndrome]] kids from a local [[Wal-Mart|mongoloid zoo]] and waved microphones and candy bars in their slobbering faces. No players ever reported noticing the difference.

==Gameplay==

Throughout the game, Ammy is wracked by uncontrollable diarrhea; this provides Ammy with the game's unique [[Shit|attack system]]. Because a jet of filth is constantly being explosively released from Ammy's Celestial (more like cel'''ASS'''tial, [[amirite]]?) Pooper, the tip of her tail is liberally coated in shit. Ammy, being a goddess, has the ability to turn the environment into toilet paper, upon which players smear the filth off of her tail. When the TP spell is switched off, all of the characters that were wiped on are killed.  This battle system was perfectly appropriate for PS2 owners, who all enjoyed flinging turds at their own reflections in mirrors and stagnant bodies of water.  The player can also use the TP technique to apply fertilizer to pretty flowers and trees, because the developers felt the game wasn't [[Homosexuality|gay]] enough without a series of farming simulations.

Bear in mind that the game is painfully [[boring|easy]], so much so that most players never die at all, causing [[retards|some people]] to think they have [[leet|the skills]]. Many Okami converts are Zelda dropouts who [[fail|couldn't get past the forest temple]] and harbor a [[rage|bitter hatred]] toward [[Zelda|Twilight Princess]] for daring to use a [[furry|lupine]] lead.

==Music==
The developers, in their effort to make Okami's music as [[bad|authentic]] as possible, incorporated the traditional [[Japanese]] sounds of monkeys being assraped, untuned guitars, old men hooting and screeching, aluminum foil being torn apart, ominous hissing, and many glittery xylophone solos. Some [[weeaboos|fans]] shelled out big bucks for [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9UDBW/sr=1-1/qid=1236538144/ref=olp_product_details/184-4417827-2645637?ie=UTF8&me=&qid=1236538144&sr=1-1&seller= the 5-CD official soundtrack] just so they could [[yiff|squeal]] over the [[shit nobody cares about|Taiko drum and koto]].

==Wii Version==
Recently, due to contractual obligations to Sony, Capcom released a platform-killing version for the Wii. Sony's plans backfired, however, because Wii fans are even fonder than PS2 owners of hooting and flinging soupy shit at passers-by.

Controversy ensued when Wii owners scraped the dung off the Okami package, only to notice that [[Shit nobody cares about|the cover art had been ripped off of some crap website and slapped on the front cover]]. [[Oh noes]]! The byootiful [[art]] was ruined! Now the Louvre would never hang a Wii box on their wall! So Capcom sent out replacement box art to sad Wii Okami owners. Minor [[lulz]] ensued when people who didn't even own a Wii abused the art replacement program in order to get free Okami shit.

== Predictable Fanbase Responses ==

[[Image:Obamabyspacecoyoteyf6.jpg|thumb|Some believe that [[Barack Obama]] is [[Satan|the possessor of mystic powers]].]]

Okami is [[lie|notable]] for managing to bring together the unholy trinity of [[furries]], [[weeaboos]] and [[basement-dwellers|artsy gamers]] into [[hell|its fandom]]. Whatever [[lulz|merit]] the game might have had was buried long ago by these [[sick fucks|individuals]], who explore their obsession in [[shitty art|meaningful ways]].

{{squote|Yeah, and many people think the graphics sucks, they just don't know its designed like that, like an art.|[[GameFAQs]] [[retard|poster]], describing why the graphics are designed to [[suck]].}}

== Using Okami To Troll Christians In Six Easy Steps ==
[[Image:OkamiWTFwoman.jpg|thumb|Jesus according to Okami. (No, no, it's the Sun God or some shit. Jesus is a raptor.)]]

With its clumsy -- yet effective -- mix of [[Weeaboo|Shinto]], [[Hippie|Taoist]] and [[Buddha|Buddhist]] propaganda, Okami can be put to use as an excellent tool for mocking the [[Christfags|faithful fundamentalists]] in your life. 

#Start a discussion about the inexplicable, possibly demon-fueled critical and/or commercial successes of games such as Okami, [[God of War]] and [[Odin]] Sphere, which portray aspects of heathen mythologies in a positive or entertaining light. 
#Focus on Okami's and its counter-Biblical messages of [[Furry|pantheism]]. Insinuate that since Amaterasu has the ability to walk on water, then she is just as powerful and important to our daily lives as [[Jesus]] is. Perhaps even more so, since ''she'' actually kicked some ass during her time on Earth, whereas Jesus really just hung around drinking wine with Judas and all of his delinquent buddies.
#Suggest that the reason all Christian-themed games -- such as Biblepalooza, Noah's Big Adventure and Go-Go Gabriel 3D -- are so terrible is that Jesus really did finally and irrevocably die on the cross, and Christians are fooling themselves into thinking that they're any better than the rest of us. [[PROTIP]]: If you're unfamiliar with real Christian-themed games, make some up; [[fact|though there are a few Christians with hand-eye coordination decent enough to reliably hold a controller without convulsively jerking it out of the console, their parents or guardians never allow portals of filth like the NES or Colecovision into their trailers]].
#Declare that Okami has inspired you to convert your children to [[Communism|Okaminism]], and that you will shortly be visiting pre-schools and kindergartens in your area (remember to be specific!) with copies of the game to "spread the Good Word". 
#[[????]]
#[[PROFIT]]!!!
