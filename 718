AwesomeCougars is the home of Anonymous Free Radio. In leyman's terms this means that anyone with the time and the inclination is able to push their shitty taste in music on those faggoty enough to listen to it, however in reality this was the birthplace of many of the best DJs of the modern age, including Moby and Fatman Slim. The previous statement is the [[truth]], and in fact lots of good stuff came from Awesome Cougars. The [[shit|awesome]] thing about ''Awesome Cougars'' is that absolutely anyone can be a part of it. Shockingly, this has led to the service being abused.

A technical point of contention between many (as in, all 7) users of the site is the prevalence of mixing tools such as [[DJ#Armchair_DJ|Virtual DJ]], as this is considered ''fake DJing'', as it takes what nonexistant skill exists in choosing, then playing music in a proficient manner and makes a further mockery of them.

==Awesome Cougars==

Dubstep seems to be the single incessant droning mass of ear rape that has proved most popular on the board, mostly because this is what [[basement dwellers]] think real live DJs play and by making a feeble attempt on [[last.fm]]'s retarded cousin they think that they may too get [[pussy]] and [[cool story bro|bro love]] from the homiez. This would be incredibly tragic, were there a whole cabal of internet dwelling music retards who thought that this was the way to go, however the (possibly even sadder) [[truth]] of the matter is that the entire "DJ" population of [[Awesome Cougars]] consists of the same 3 people, droning away with all the time in the world. Incidentally, it has been known that the occasional awesome person will stumble upon the site, thus giving some respite from the gut wrenching monotony. These people do not generally last long.

== Boards ==

Where there's shit, there's a board.

===SFW Boards===
* Cooking - New Cooking board for fat people.
* Drawing - A board for the drawfags. Features Shi-Painter.
* Music, Radio & DJ discussion - Discussion about music, virtual DJ, and other radio related subjects. Also this is the place to discuss the quality of the DJ's you heard on the stream.
* DJ Avatars - DJ's upload their totally awesome pictures so that everyone can see their lolcat/ganja leaf whilst they're streaming their totally awesome and relevant music!.
* Music Uploads - Faggots hear a song they like, then they beg the DJ to upload it for them. One post.

===NSFW===

<strike>Like every other [[List_of_*chan_boards|*chan]] , non-worksafe boards are mandatory. Unlike every awedsome chan with a seperate board for every fetish you can think of, AwesomeCougars keeps it simple with just three [[NSFW]] boards /b/, /pron/ and /f/.</strike> /pron/ was later removed because of  admins being tired of people posting too much spam on the board, basicly making it a second /b/. It was replaced with the SFW board /c/ooking.
'''All boards are now SFW in a doomed-to-fail attempt to make the website more "[[retarded|family friendly]]."'''

* <strike>Random</strike> General Discussion - The leading board in traffic, winning the race at 1 post per day. Possibly due to those who are new at the internet confusing it for being attached to a certain imageboard which shall remain nameless.
* <strike>Drugs</strike> - It is a mystery ┐(ﾟ∀ﾟ)┌
* Flash - Post not very good flashy loops, games, and other shit here.
