'''iTunes''', also known as the new RealPlayer or [[Quicktime]] 2: [[Electric Boogaloo]], iTunes is what makes all the [[Mac]] [[fanboi]]s cream their panties at night.  Originally made when Apple [[buttsecks|assraped]] the makers of the better mac mp3 player: SoundJam MP.  Able to play all their [[Gorillaz]], Radiohead, Sigur Ros, [[Linkin Park]], and [[My Chemical Romance]] [[shit|songs]], it's no wonder why every [[art school|art student]] and [[emo]] kid has this as their main music player.  Plus, now that iTunes has [[Final Fantasy]] music for you to download (only $0.99 or Â£00.79 for the 30 second 8-bit opening of Final Fantasy II [[OMG]]), every [[basement dweller]] on the block will be selling that one-way bus ticket their mom bought them to go visit the [[13 year old boy]] they met online for some great tunez![[Oneoneone|11]]! A new version of iTunes is released every second, because the people over at [[Apple]] [[Fail|just can't get anything right]]. And when they do, here comes the next generation of [[iPod|iPods]]! [[Lulz]]!

==Why iTunes Is A [[Scientology|Scam]]==

[[File:Beatles pirate bay itunes.jpg|thumb|With a little help from my pirate friends.]]

Even though some [[Steve Jobs|Faggot]] at Apples says that [[lie|he hates DRM]], he doesn't.  The reason he doesn't is because when someone [[idiot|buys some music off itunes]] and then a year later his or her [[Mitchell Henderson|ipod]] breaks, because it is made of pure [[shit]], when he or she goes to buy another [[mp3]] player and plugs it in to the computer, he or she can no longer use any of his or her music that they bought off Itunes.  So the logical thing to do is to return the higher quality competitor mp3 player and to go buy another ipod.  Thus, [[Apple]] becomes a rich Jew who [[rape|jews]] you into [[gay|continually buying their new product]].  They make money and you get [[fuck]]ed.  This is one of two reasons why anyone who can think logically doesn't like [[Apple]]. Do the world a favor and don't support this [[bullshit]], download for free or buy off of amazon mp3 which sells [[DRM]] free files only.

(Psssst: Apple lets you burn your playlists to CD minus DRM. You can then rip them back in DRM-free MP3s. THERE GOES THE SYSTEM!!!!)

==OMG VIDEOS111!!==

With the release of the new video [[iPod]], iTunes lets you download [[Old people|Golden Girls]] and [[Fatty|That's So Raven]], plus you get [[gay|Madonna]] music videos!  Unfortunately, they don't have [[pr0n]] available yet :(.

==Billionth iTune==
About [[100 years ago]], [[Shit nobody cares about|Alex Ostrovsky bought the billionth iTune]], "Speed of Sound" by Coldplay.  After receiving [[hookers and blow|lots of new iPods and lots of iTunes money]] he promptly escaped into his own  [[faggotry|rectum]].

==Installation and Maintenance==
In keeping of Apple software tradition, every year iTunes becomes obsolete and no longer works. Remedy: Reinstall (1 hr), and if using a [[Windows]] computer, prepare for a Dramapocalypse. Sautee. Serves 6-10 (or two, if you're [[fat]]. (You are.) )

==Fun Facts About iTunes==
*Only pretentious [[fag]]s use it, despite the fact that Apple force iPod owners to use it, meaning they turn pretty much every music lover into a pretentious fag.
