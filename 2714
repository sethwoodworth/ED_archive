Esperanza
[[Image:Esperanza.png|thumb|[[TOW]] elitism]]
The TOW club for unfunny elitist fucks. Typically full of ass-pies, Esperanza hates everything that isn't [[Uncyclopedia|complete and utter shit]].

As it stands, Esperanza is <strike>'''pretty damn fucked.'''</strike> '''DELETED.'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Esperanza]

==What the fuck is dis shit?==
Esperanza is, in a nutshell, a TOW organization that strives to be as fucking boring and basement-dwellerish as possible. It is basically [[Wikipedia]]'s hive of cocksuckers and aspiring admins (read as MER-C and MER-C respectively).

It is populated by [[nathanr|pedophiles]], [[furries]], [[Sceptre|asshole]]s, [[Karmafist|dipshits]], friendless fucks and products of daddy-daughter [[incest]]. Apparently these poor assholes are so lonely that they have to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Esperanza/Archive01#Self-nominations nominate themselves] for positions of power within Esperanza, which [[You don't have any friends|illustrates a number of points]].

Esperanza was supposedly designed to save people from committing [[Wikicide]]: the organization was supposed to kick into high gear "[[Shit nobody cares about|if someone was ill or feeling highly stressed due to issues on Wikipedia]]" or [[IRL]], or if someone else committed Wikicide.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EA]

As it was, Esperanza seemed to be nothing more than a bunch of jackoffs who stuck a <font color="green">green "E"</font> somewhere in their signature so they could show the Wikipeons how [[1337]] and [[Ripper|hardcore]] they were. It was subsequently [[pwn3d]] and [[VFD|deleted]], so now it exists only as a shitty green E in [[at least 100]] signatures. In other words, no different than before.

==Uselessness of such an organization==
Esperanza, in its current form, has gained considerable attention as of late due to being considered detrimental to "Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia [[pedophile|anyone can edit]][[oneoneone|!!1]]"

On the 28th of December, 2006 it was [[VFD|put up for deletion]] for the second time[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Esperanza]. The Esperanza circle jerk, of course, ran to the defence of the only thing that gives their miserable lives an iota of purpose and attacked the nominee:

{{Quote|'''Keep''' harmless club. Hardban the shitstirrer. Nominating this for deletion is a breach of WP:CIVIL. Can you not find something to edit?|[[Grace_Note]]|Esperanza MfD}}

{{Quote|'''KEEP''' - What the hell are all of you [[Drug|smoking]]?!Seriously, I thought that this organization was very nice, but when you jackasses wanted to delete it, it was as if Esperanza's ideals came to a sudden halt, and everything I thought about it changed. Like Kyoko, I'm gonna quit. I'm saying keep because I believe that Esperanza still has a chance to inspire as it once did. Whoever put Esperanza here for deletion, go fuck yourself.|Bushcarrot|Esperanza Mfd}}

This outpouring of support for the WP:EA project did not deter the deletionist fags, however:

{{Quote|'''[[KILL IT WITH FIRE|Kill with Fire]] and Brimstone''' - (edit conflict) This project is reduced to squabbling amongst itself, whining, and complaining.|PTO|Esperanza MfD}}

{{Quote|'''Delete and [[Salt the earth|Salt]]''' - ... in regards to Esperanza as a whole, the only recommendation in regards to keeping it for historical use is to show people in future a good example of what should not be placed in Wikipedia space. it is for those reasons, I vote delete and [[Salt the earth|salt]] all pages. It's ironic that Esperanza is Spanish for hope, yet there is no hope left in Esperanza.|gheretford|Esperanza MfD}}
