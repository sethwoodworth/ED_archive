'''''Harry Potter''''' is a series of [[tl;dr]] fantasy and wish-fulfillment books about magic and wizards written for children by British [[prostitute]] J.K. Rowling (a.k.a. Just Kidding Rowling), whose books are inferior compared to those of other [[Stephanie_Meyer|successful writers]]. In reality, the stories are [[awwright|alright]] if not for its retarded virgin [[13-year-old boy|fans]]. Rowling lives in Edinburgh, Scotland. If you want to find her and kill her (which must be done with [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|fire]]), ask someone in Edinburgh. The story of the books is centered around a young boy who discovers he has the power to destroy his cruel peers and family [[Columbine]] style - but does not, because he is indeed more humble and virtuous than [[Mary Sue]]. 

Rowling initially intended to use the books as a means to teach witchcraft and wizardry to young children, in hopes of raising an army to take down the [[Catholic]] Church. However, she soon discovered that her fans were incredibly stupid and would rather sit around writing horrible [[fanfiction]] and [[Wizard Rock|music]] instead. Rather than accept defeat, Rowling decided to use her bitchcraft and become a quadrillionaire by selling the books and giving license to manufacture ''Harry Potter'' movies, [[Video games|video games]], [[dildo|toys]], board games, clothes, [[condom|accessories]], CDs, food, beverages, [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=baltimization Baltimization]. And so, the story of the young wizard known as Harry Potter has since become a global phenomenon, gaining more popularity than both [[God]] and [[Jesus]] and suckering millions of [[Retard|retards]] such as [[You|yourself]] into buying shit. 

However, as infuriating as it was, many decide to side along with Harry Potter since they prefer it over the Mormon vampire sex fantasy, [[Bullshit|Twilight]].

==The Books==
If you truly don't know at least a rough outline of the plot of ''Harry Potter'' by now, you've probably been living under a rock for the past decade... and your ignorance is enviable! Anyway, it's typical [[otherkin|fantasy]] [[Mary Sue]] fare, with [[fap|magic]], [[Dragon|dragons]], [[Midget|elves]], and good triumphing over evil. The series' themes are: Bildungsroman, a bunch of thinly veiled symbolism, and other such literary [[Shit nobody cares about|bullshit]]. But the majority of fans are only interested in fantasizing about the [[Sex|fun]]-filled relationships between the characters. So, for you lucky people who haven't yet been swept up in the whirlwind of [[faggotry]] that is ''Harry Potter'', here's the general plot of the seven books:

===Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone===

Renamed ''Sorcerer's Stone'' in the [[America|U.S.]] as too many [[retards]] don't understand [[English]], this is the book that started everything. Ironically, the Philosopher's Stone has <i>absolutely nothing</i> to do with magic, but rather [[Fullmetal Alchemist|alchemy]], which is just as fictional as magic. A [[fag|boy]] named Harry Potter who lives with his [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air|Aunt and Uncle]] once caused a villain named Voldemort ([[Hitler]] with magic) to [[pwn]] Harry's parents with a magic spell. He finds out he's a wizard at 11 years old, and then Karl Marx takes him to a magic school, Hogwarts, which is run by a gay old pedophile named Dumbledore. ([http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/29/arts/29conn.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=dumbledore%20gay&st=cse Srsly.]) Harry, despite an upbringing in a cupboard that ought to give him the physique and personality of a [[Josef Fritzl|Fritzl]] child, is pukingly good at everything, befriends a poor [[ginger|red-headed kid named Ron]] and a [[whore|girly]] [[nerd|bookworm]] named Hermione, and the three go about doing [[Lemon Party|magical things]]. Later, Voldemort, acting through an [[Arab]], tries to get a [[crack|rock with magical powers]], but is beaten by three 11-year-old children. [[RAGE|Unfortunately, Harry lives and the story continues.]]

===Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets===

Harry returns to Hogwarts, and there's a bunch of drama about [[h8|people being attacked]]. This novel introduces a giant, poisonous snake that can [[Goatse|kill people by looking at them]]. The snake tries to pull a [[Holocaust|genocide]] by ridding the school of "Mudbloods", but [[fails]] to kill a single fucking person. There is also a sadistic tree with limbs that look like disproportional cocks, which fails to kill both Harry and Ron. Later, it tries to kill Harry, but is somehow defeated by the visually impaired [[I'm 12 years old and what is this? | twelve-year-old]] (also see, [[sad]]). Anyway, in CoS, Voldemort pretends to be a book to lure Ron's little sister into [[pedo|his basement]]. Unfortunately, Harry again lives and the story continues. On the [[not|badass]] side, he kills a giant fucking [[cock|snake]]. [[Guro|With a sword]]. Magically pulled out of a singing hat. This book made so little sense that they had to release a supplement in 2005, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.

===Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban===
This one's pretty uneventful, despite all the [[furry|furries]]. Dumbledore appoints an old werewolf as a teacher, but he doesn't go crazy and kill any students. Instead, he teaches Harry how to shoot white, translucent material out of his [[cock|wand]] in order to defeat all his fears; [[Pedobear]] is proud. Later on, said werewolf marries a [[16-year-old girl]] and Pedobear is even prouder, true fax. Anyway, Harry finds out he has a godfather named [[Serious Business|Sirius Black]] who was wrongfully convicted of several accounts of /jb/ /cp/, party v& and generally being a GTA badass. Ron's pet rat turns out to be a fatty and a follower of Voldemort but he escapes before Harry is able to wrap him in duct tape and shove him up his ass. [[Noone]] dies and the story (unfortunately) continues. 

===Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire===
In the fourth installment of the series [[Arab|Sanjeev Poppadom]] finds himself faced with a goblet of Korma.  This year, Hogwarts school of Child Molestation and Faggotry is the host of the [[Special Olympics|Tri Wizard tournament]].  The more [[fags|discerning]] readers quickly notice that there are four of them rather than three, as the name "Tri Wizard" implies. Anyway, the [[retards|champions]] are given some faggot tasks to complete, but no one cares because they are more interested in the [[Expert|SERIOUS BADMUN]] that is Mad Eye Moody (So named because he managed to splash himself in the eye with some pungent BADMUN jizz from his [[Niggercock|formidable penis]] during a highly impressive [[hentai]] accident.  The eye had to be removed.  There were no other options.) Some [[gay]] shit happens [[TL;DR|blah blah blah]], then Harry is in a graveyard.  Voldemort is about to [[sodomize]] Harry to within an inch of his life when Harry gets a little over exited and his [[Cum|translucent slimy dead family]] spill out of his [[cock|wand]] to protect him.  Hilarity ensues. <s>Edward Cullen</s> Cedric Diggory dies. The end.

===Harry Potter and the Order of the [[Penis|Phoenix]]===
[[Image:Harry_Potter_is_a_gaylord.jpg|thumb|Harry Potter is gay...substantiating evidence.]]
[[Image:HarryPottersCockGoWhereLuLZ.jpg|thumb|]]

[[tl;dr]]. Harry goes through a severe [[emo]] stage. Harry's dogfather dies. Fangirls [[BAW|BAWWWWWWWWWW]]. Sexy new teacher Dolores Umbridge molests the children by scribbling erotic messages in the back of their masochistic hands. This novel marks the introduction of HAGGER's half-brother, [[Grawp]] confusing readers further as to how the hell Hagrid was conceived. [[L-L-LUNAJACK!|Luna Lovegood]] appears for the first time in this book, and /b/'s balls turn blue.

===Harry Potter and the Half-Blood/Half-[[Crip]] [[Peach|Prince]]===

''For further reading on this topic, see [[The Great Dumbledore Dies Meme of 2005]].''

[[ZOMG]]!![[oneoneone|1]] SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE!1! It should be noted that since Dumbledore is gay, this makes Snape's killing a [[H8|h8]] crime. In this book Rowling stopped caring about canon couples and just decided to comply to the fangirls (i.e. setting up [[Ginger|Ginny]] and [[Fag|Harry]]). Everyone [[fuck|snogs]] everyone and then BAAAAWWW's uncontrollably. Also, Harry finds out that in order to defeat Voldemort, he has to find and destroy several "[[whore|Hor]]cruxes", which are objects that act as cheat codes (i.e. [[Jesus|extra lives]], [[terrorism|pwning infidels]])...but you know what? It doesn't fucking matter. [[Unrealistic Expectations|Good is going to triumph over evil, Voldemort will eventually die, and everyone will live happily ever after.]]

===Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows===

The final book in the series, and much more important than any other. This is because a shit load characters died in this book, increasing the [[lulz]] potential [[statistics|tenfold]]. Naturally, [[spoiler|spoilers]] were released days before the global release, and the trolls came out from their [[basement dweller|mothers' basements]] in full force to ruin everyone's fun. Here are those spoilers now, representing the ruination of Potterfags worldwide:

{{Quote|when I read this leaked scene, I was truely traumaitzed for a whole day, I still am i bit, but my god I cried and cried and couldn't stop shaking.|[[Snapesnogger]]. If only her shaking had been a fatal [[fat|heartattack]]...}}

*Harry marries, and proceeds to eat and fuck Ginny's sweet little ginger-cunt. They have children and [[dying alone|live happily ever after]]

But [[srsly]], who gives a [[shit]]? ''Harry Potter'' sucks anyway.

==Moral of the Story==

The [[Moralfags|moral]] of the final installment of the series is quite simple: [[Christianity|if you become an hero, you will be magically warped to a seedy old station where you will meet a mutilated baby and an old hairy pedophile who will reincarnate you after preaching to you.]]

==The Movies==

[[image:harrypotter-copypasta.jpg|thumb|right|Harry Potter fans can has some.]]

In 2001, the movie version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philospher's Stone was released, and other movies were to follow.  As always this just let the [[stupid|illiterate]] fuckers onboard the failtrain.

Key differences between the films and books include:

* Hermiones House Elf fetish “[[vomit|SPEW]]” club is omitted, for family reasons.

* Ginny’s stalkerism of Harry is also omitted, because it ruins the surprise of the later [[pr0ns]] scene.

* The Weasleys never black person invade the Dursleys house in the fourth book, because having white people do that sort of thing just doesn’t look right.

* In the films the four [[furfags]] who made the Marauders Map are never revealed.

* The [[rape|trauma]] the Death Eaters inflicted on Neville’s parents with their inserting of their long [[pen0rs|wands]] up their asses is never revealed, and they are just left as dead.

* [[Unfunny|The films are displayed in images displayed on a screen at 32 frames per second whereas the books were printed on paper]].

==The Vibrating Broomstick Debacle of 2002==
[[Image:Harry potter good vibrations.jpg|thumb|Newsflash: Girls love putting vibrating things between their legs]]

Mattel, joining in the feeding frenzy for Potter-related toys, released "Harry Potter's Nimbus 2000 Broom." Mattel could not offer a broom that actually flies, so they settled for making it vibrate. Future toy? The Golden Snatch.

Listed on [[Amazon]], the initial customer reviews were a treasure trove of [[lulz]]. Though [[Amazon]] has since replaced them with dull reviews that say only that the broom is boring and not appealing to boys, the first reviews have been carefully preserved on [http://www.peterrivard.com/Pages/potter.html many web sites]. It 403s when you click it because the webmaster is a pretty lame guy. Eh rejects links from ED and does afraid of everything. Copy and paste the link, newfag.

* "This toy was #1 on my daughter's Christmas list. So what the heck, although it has no educational value I figured it would be good for imaginative play. It wasn't until after she opened her gift and started playing with it that I realized that the toy may offer a more than sensational experience. The broomstick has cute sound effects and ***VIBRATES*** when they put it between their legs to fly. Come on---what were the creators of this toy thinking? She'll keep playing with the Nimbus 2000, but with the batteries removed."
* "I recently bought this for my son, Vantro. He's a HUGE Harry Potter fan. Seen the movie 32 times (in the theaters) and made the paper. This toy gives him the ability to fly around the house zapping things. My only problem I see with the toy is the batteries drain too fast and his sister fights him over it, so now I need to buy her one."

* "My 12 year old daughter is a big Harry Potter fan, and loved the part with the Nimbus 2000, so I decided to buy her this toy. I was afraid she would think it was too babyish, but she LOVES this toy. Even my daughter's friends enjoy playing with this fun toy. I was surprised at how long they can just sit in her room and play with this magic broomstick! A great buy for any Harry Potter fan! :)"

* "Well it's Christmas time and I need a gift for my 6YR son. He's a big Harry Potter fan, maybe too much. I keep trying to get him into Hockey or anything else a man should be doing, but instead he'd rather be riding a broom around the living room making swooshing sounds, pissing me off when I'm trying to watch football. Anyways the gift seems to be a big hit. It does vibrate, and goes through batteries rather fast. Even my 14 yr old daughter likes to play with the broom. She likes to play with the broom when were not around or late at night. I think she gets embarrassed when we find it in her room, [[Denial|but I can understand, she doesn't want anyone knowing she plays with her little brothers toys.]] With a few batteries and a flick of a switch, [[Orgasm|my Son and daughter can get carried off to Harry Potter Fantasy land.."]]

==Fatal Imagery==
[[Image:Image.jpg|thumb|This image led to the suicides of 63% of all [[LiveJournal|DeadJournal]] users]]

In the summer of 2005, the ire of [[16 year old girl|16 year old girls]] was raised when [http://www.livejournal.com/users/_dumbledoredies/443.html#cutid1 multiple spoilers] were clandestinely placed into several prominent LiveJournal communities. So many flamewar-induced [[lulz]] ensued that [[LJ Drama]] wouldn't touch it, citing that it was 'old as soon as it began'.

The direct result of these events was an overall increase in [[emo]]-style 'woe is me' journal posts by [[Fan|Fans]], a feat once thought impossible by [[expert|science]]. The overall sentiment was "when we said [[pictures plz]], this is not what we meant." For more information, please see [[The Great Dumbledore Dies Meme of 2005]].

[[Image:Draco is obviously fucking her.jpg|thumb|[[Duh|P.S. Draco has been fucking Hermione since the second year]]]]

The [[ship]] war to end all wars. Originally [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HPforGrownups/ just a small argument in forum], it is now a [[lol]]war between  [http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/showthread.php?s=d49f015581d88f109306c9c4bb5c4a6e&threadid=5117 Hermione/Harry and Harry/Ginny.]

[[Irony|Ironically,]] all [[whore|female characters]] of the Harry Potter series are, indeed, sluts. Everyone knows Harry Potter is one big [[sex|hormone-driven]] [[yaoi|fanfic]]. Even [[gay|Albus Dumbledore]], the one wizard who [[Juliana Wetmore|Voldemort]] [[rape|fears]], has been known to [[lemonparty|join the fun.]]

Still, a great many mousy spinsters and [[16-year-old girl]]s spend their time dreaming up [[slashfic|romantic stories]] about who in the Harry Potter universe is fucking who.  Prior to the release of the 7th book, a central division between these literary scholars concerned itself with whom Harry Potter would end up fucking.  One group believed that Harry Potter would end up fucking [[Dwarlinggirlxcore|Hermione]].  The other group believed that Harry Potter would end up fucking Ginny. But there's always a chance for some [[Orgy|group action]].

Since the people who believed that Harry Potter would end up fucking Ginny have actual in-text justifications for their belief, they were unsurprisingly proven correct in the final book.  The "Harmonians" (the dorky name the Harry/Hermione slashfic writers gave themselves) perceived this as a [[Msscribe|personal insult]].  

The insult was compounded by [http://www.mugglenet.com/jkrinterview2.shtml an interview given by J.K. Rowling to a Harry Potter fan site] in which she kinda-subtly-but-not-really delivered a virtual clue-by-four to the heads of the people who really, honestly thought that Harry would end up fucking Hermione. 
{{quote|[..] I'm a relative newcomer to the world of shipping, because for a long time, I didn't go on the net and look up Harry Potter. A long time. [..] I had never gone and looked at fan sites, and then one day I did and oh - my - god. Five hours later or something, I get up from the computer shaking slightly [..]. ‘What is going on?’ And it was during that first mammoth session that I met the shippers, and it was a most extraordinary thing. I had no idea there was this huge underworld seething beneath me.|J.K. Rowling}} 

This led to [http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/766664.html a fandom meltdown of truly epic proportions] as Harry/Hermione slash writers around the [[internets|intarweb]] collectively blew a gasket.  The resulting [[FandomWank|wankalypse]] could be felt as far away as several inches, and ended up producing such gems as the following:


*''If I had any children, I would also not let them read HBP. I just don't see how some people could not see the abrupt change in Hermione. Hermione is no longer a role model for younger girls.

*''In that same Yahoo group, I tried to start a thread about Christian symbolism in HP (before HBP of course). I feel so stupid now because it all went out the window in HBP.''

*''I felt that Song of Songs mirrored Harry/Hermione because it had a theme of friends becoming lovers. (Don't get me wrong, I also saw the theme [[rape|God's universal love for mankind]]... biggrin.gif )''

*''''Sadly, I will need a lot of prayers and meditation (and maybe some counseling). I was so emotionally invested in this relationship and JKR messed with it and threw it in our faces. I really need to get back to my faith in God. (I've taken it for granted for the past few months because of HP.) Don't feel sorry for me. It was all my fault.'''''


[[LOL WUT|You've got to be fucking kidding.]] J.K Rowling is now blamed on an extensive amount of Harry Potter fanfiction sites for "Torpedoeing" the H/Hr shippers ship. Torpedoeing is when the creator proves a way for a [[ship]] to cease existing, which did indeed happen and caused the rise of teenage girl suicides after "The Deathly Hallows" by 300%.

There was also a petition in which the signatories, completely divorced from any [[reality|sense of perspective]], demanded that J.K. Rowling turn over the writing duties of Book 7 to one of the fat 40-year-old female virgins who writes Harry/Hermione slashfic on the web.  Because J.K. Rowling doesn't know her own characters well enough to write THE BEAUTIFUL TRUTH OF HARRY AND HERMIONE BOINKING LIKE BUNNIES!  And she doesn't realize that GINNY IS A SLUT! The fact that Hermione dated a Russian rapist who was three years older than her during the events of the fourth book isn't in the least bit slutty, by the way.

In addition, [http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/ultimate_betrayal another petition] was created demanding an apology and re-write under penalty of boycott (lol bullshit, like any of the rabid fans would miss out on the last book)

Grief counselors have been called in.

<big>'Harry Potter' publisher gets subpoena to identify pirate</big>
From Bloomberg News

July 17, 2007

Scholastic Corp., publisher of the new "Harry Potter" book, obtained a subpoena to learn the identity of a California website user who allegedly posted copies of the final sequel, scheduled for release Saturday.

Scholastic said in a court filing Monday that "materials hosted on Photobucket.comcom's system" contain materials that infringe copyrights owned by Scholastic and J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books. Photobucket.com, a News Corp. unit, is a website for sharing photos and videos on social networks such as MySpace.

The subpoena was sent to Gaia Interactive Inc. in San Jose seeking the identity of a user on gaiaonline.com, a social network, according to the filing in San Francisco federal court.

Gaia complied with the subpoena, removed the material and temporarily banned the user from the site, said Gaia spokesman Bill Danon. The postings included scanned material and a discussion of the material, he said.

==New York Trolled by New York Times==

[[Image:EmmaQuit.jpg|thumb|Right now, [[Grawp]]!]]

The New York Times reviewed the book, revealing spoilers for everyone reading the article (which is pretty much everyone). The spoilers even pissed off J.K. Rowling! -- But they probably just did it for the [[I did it for the lulz|lulz]], so it's okay.

{{quote|I am staggered that some American newspapers have decided to publish purported spoilers in the form of reviews in complete disregard of the wishes of literally millions of readers, particularly children,|J.K.

== JKR DIDN'T DO HP ==
[[File:Snitch.jpg|thumb|right|Wicked fast, and damn near impossible to see. What ever could it [[Goatse|be?]]]]
The massive wow-factor of Rowling deciding to write the HP novels whilst being very poor, a [[woman]] and a mom has made many critics decide that the books were written by loads of people, designed to [[Pedobear|tickle the interests of young readers]] internationally. In approximately forty years, when [[PROFIT!|profit]]s become lower, many are expecting the big "[[Lol|JK]]!111" from Rowling.

==Trivia==
[[Image:Harry Potter Goths.jpg|thumb|According to [[Tara Gilesbie]], Harry Potter and friends are the consummate [[goths]] and regularly go clubbing.]]

*70[[Statistics|%]] of [[LiveJournal]] users have a ''Harry Potter'' [[icon]]. The other 30% have ''[[Twilight]]'' icons.

*[[Tara Gilesbie]] has written the most infamous ''Harry Potter'' fan-fiction on fanfiction.net, ''[[My Immortal]]''. [http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2828044/1/] Her sister, [[Trista Gilesbie]], has written another fanfic, ''Bring Me To Life'' [http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3173713/1/]. Both of these titles came from [[Evanescence|Evanescence]] songs.

* {{ljcomm|pornish_pixies}} is a major ''Harry Potter'' pedo fiction community on LJ. Its deletion in May 2007 helped escalate the drama in [[The Great Livejournal Strikethrough of 2007]].

* Harry's infatuation with the long wood pole called a broomstick began after spending many hours together with Ron Weasley.

* The depth of information and commentary you see on the Encyclopedia Dramatica Harry Potter article outs many [[ED]] contributors as closet ''Harry Potter'' [[fan]]s, known in the vernacular as [[fags]].

* Everyone who died in all 7 books had it coming.

* [[Msscribe]] is responsible for more drama in the fandom than Snapesnogger and Tara Gillesbie combined?

* Harry Potter is a fucking Gary Stu but his fans will swear by their books that he is not. Beware delusionitis.

* Dumbledore is gay because a successful, intelligent, non married man cannot be straight.

* J.K. Rowling stole the idea for Harry Potter from the 1986 film "Troll" (no really). One of the main characters is named Harry Potter, and the movie is based on witches and other mythical creatures. Bitch can't even come up with her own stuff.

==A Very [[Shitty|Potter]] Musical==

[[Image:Pottermusical.jpg|thumb|Changing iTunes one fantard at a time]]

([http://www.hollywoodnews.com/2010/07/24/a-very-potter-musicals-team-starkid-premieres-sequel-tops-glee-and-gaga-on-itunes-and-talks-future-projects/ As of July 2010], "A Very Pooter Musical" is more popular than [[Gay|Glee]] and [[Lady GaGa]] on iTunes. [[PROFIT]]!!111)

As if ''Harry Potter'' weren't gay enough, some college faggots in Michigan decided in 2009 to make a musical and post it on [[JewTube]]. Entitled "A Very Potter Musical," this clusterfuck is [[tl;dr|too long, don't watch]] but clearly took time and energy to write, produce and stage (and we wonder [[this is why we can't have nice things|why we can't have nice things]] in the world). 

The entire cast is made up of Americunt mid-west gays; the entire script and score feature retarded lyrics and unfunny poop/sex jokes; the staging and choreography comprise of teenagers rolling around the stage like they have [[ADHD]]; all in all, this monstrosity of a production is strictly for fat HP-fantards, and was written by Americunt [[12-year-old boy]]s and [[16-year-old]] girls.

...Hence, "A Very Potter Musical" was a huge hit on the Interwebz, with [[over 9,000]] views. A month after its grand debut on YouTube, the idiots who posted it removed it in order to "edit more [[hentai|mature elements]] from the videos." Youtube now features a children-friendly version. Yeah, ok. 

Watch this shit [http://www.youtube.com/user/StarKidPotter here], and be sure to check out its [[retarded|brilliant]] sequel, "A Very Potter [[Electric Boogaloo|Sequel]]." Also note the other production entitled, "Me and My Dick," srsly.

==Equus==
Adding to the lulz surrounding the world of ''Harry Potter'', in 2006, Daniel Radcliffe (star of the ''Harry Potter'' movies) decided to act in a play which required him to be completely nude. The story is about a troubled [[Bestiality|stable boy]] who gouges horses' eyes out before having wild sex with them in the hay. Anyway, here's some pictures, you [[sick fuck]].

==Terrible [[Bel-Air]]==
Now this is the story all about how,<br>
My life got flipped, turned upside down,<br>
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,<br>
I'll tell you how I became a famous wizard of Britain<br>

In Godric's Hollow I was born and raised<br>
In a crib is where I spent most of my days.<br>
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool,<br>
And all oblivious I was goin' to wizarding school.<br>

When a some dark guy who was up to no good,<br>
Started killin' people in my neighborhood.<br>
I survived one little fight an while my mom was clinging,<br>
Said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Little Whinging."<br>

I heard a motorcycle, and when it came near,<br>
I said "fuck" because it was gigantic.<br>
If anything I could say that this shit was live,<br>
But I thought "Nah forget it, Yo home to Privat Drive."<br>

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight,<br>
and I yelled to Hagrid "Yo homes, smell ya later."<br>
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there,<br>
Then I got married to Ginny and had three children named Lily, James, and Albus Severus on pages 753-759.

On October 19, 2007 at Carnegie Hall in NYC, J.K Rowling [http://www.newsweek.com/id/50787 publicly announced] that Albus Dumbledore is [[gay]]. She claims this move was to help promote gay tolerance, which is obviously her only intention. This is clear when Dumbledore, the only (announced) gay character in the book DIES, proving once and for all that [[god hates fags|God hates fags]].  Incidentally, she only confirmed this in response to newsgroup discussions that had been about this very topic for some time beforehand, proving that there's nothing she'd change about her characters at the drop of a hat to keep herself in the spotlight.

Of course, if Rowling really wanted to promote tolerance, it would have made better sense to include an openly [[gay]]. Hogwarts student who struggles with coming out, bullying, finding a partner to [[buttsecks]], being [[assrape|assraped]] by a broomstick for his sexuality, etc., eventually becoming [[an hero]] in the end. However, seeing as that would have actually been edgy, required some editorial balls, and turned off about 99% of Rowling's cash-generating [[Americunt]] audience, such a move was never even considered.  The only gay character in the series was announced after the fact, as an afterthought.  Ironically, in spite of her stated opposition to bigotry and promotion of tolerance, JK Rowling has said in numerous interviews that she fought hard to keep any and all American actors out of the films.  That's her thanks, I guess, for the [[over 9,000|billions]] of [[jewgold]] Americans have spent on her [[shit|works]].

Most of us already knew about Dumbledore's gayness, due to the flamboyant purple robes and all, but now all the ''Harry Potter'' fantards are either committing [[Cult|mass suicide]] or writing as many horrible [[slash]] fics as possible.

This means that Snape must really hate the gays if he went out and committed a hate crime by killing Dumbledore. That or he was angry because Dumbledore stole his gay lover.

This also means [[Chris Hansen]] failed at stopping Dumbledore from [[Rape|violating]] generations of children as he was the headmaster of a fairy school...or Snape IS Chris Hansen. This would be horrible for [[Snapesnogger]], who is both very into Snape and a pedo. It would be great for the rest of us, as it would finally get rid of her. Sadly, this is unlikely.

JK Rowling has also revealed that the character Lupin is a [[furry]], though he postured as a [[teen werewolf|werewolf]].  Actually, it's clear that furry fandom is quite popular is the wizarding world, demonstrated by  the people transforming into cats and dogs and such.

'''NEWS ALERT''': [[Fag|Ian McKellen]] is now begging for the role of Albus Dumbledore!!!!!!!111
