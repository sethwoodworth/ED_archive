Firefly
{{spoilers|text=WASH AND SHEPHERD BOOK DIE!}}

'''''Firefly''''' is an American show which is similar to ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' because it stars [[brokeback mountain|cowboys in space]]. Despite the high tech of the show's universe, its characters use revolvers, grenades, etc. The show went off the air [[Shit nobody cares about|because nobody watched it]]. It was created by [[Joss Whedon]], the [[chubby]] [[cunt|man]] best known for ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and its inferior spin-off, ''[[Goatse|Angel]]''. Fans of the show are usually referred to as Brownpants.

''Serenity'' is a [[sci-fi]] movie about a doped up [[Loli|underaged girl]] named Captain Assburger, or [[Mary Sue|River Tam]] to her friends. She has psychic powers that almost enable her to sense imminent danger to her buddies.  Since that power sucks and she only used it once, she also has the ability to [[Hurr|flip out]] and kick major ass. The [[bitch]] is crazy. [[Bullshit|The cast includes some up & coming awesome stars.]] ''Serenity'' is also the name of the super-advanced spaceship that they ride around in. The whole thing is based off of the short lived and [[lie|most awsumest show in the history of television]], ''[[Star Wars|Firefly]]''.

===Plot===
The movie starts with space [[rednecks]] being [[rape|oppressed]] by [[the Man|the government]], which basically consists of a bunch of criminals who everyone likes. [[Faggot|Captain]] [[aspie|Assburger]] gets saved by her [[incest|brother]] and they join the half-assed crew of the ship ''Serenity'', where she is given the [[Lame|valuable]] job of protecting her shipmates from harm using her precognition, and her brother is given the task of being an [[incest|over-protective]] [[emo]] troublemaker. The chick only actually saves them once, when she senses a bunch of [[niggas|zombie killers]] heading their way, and then [[Secks|the reason she's a part of the crew]] is pretty much forgotten. Since the big bad [[the Man|government]] wants [[Faggot|Captain]] [[aspie|Assburger]] so they can purge the universe of the blight that is [[aspie|Assburger]] syndrome, [[Douche|Captain Surrogate]], being the dashing and [[gay|witty]] [[pussy|rebel]] he is, decides to keep her so he can force [[the Man|the government]] to accept [[aspie|assburger's syndrome]] as an acceptable mental illness for the lulz. The big bad [[the Man|government]] sends a flaky black person after them who uses a sword, which makes sense considering that they have space-travel technology.

2 hours later, the same mega awesome plot is going on with no change and no character development. [[Faggot|Captain]] [[aspie|Assburger]] leads them on a wild goose chase until they finally go to a planet and...who fucking cares because they kill off the ship's pilot, Wash ([[Lie|the only likable character on the show]]) just so that they could end the series with Captain [[aspie|Assburger]] flying the ship while the Captain lusts after her underage (kick)ass.

==Fandom==

''Serenity'' impregnated [[basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[retard]]s with crappy [[fanfiction]], which they promptly birthed all over the [[internets]].  People saw all sorts of sexual tension in the movie that no one else had the perception to see: Captain Surrogate/Generic Badass, Summer Glau/Captain Surrogate and Generic Badass/Summer Glau fap material were churned out at an alarming rate. People got themselves all worked up over Summer Glau just because she could flip out and beat the crap out of everyone in sight, even though she only did this twice. [[Idiot|Fans]] raved about how great of a movie it was compared to the canceled TV series, and for a time, things were good. Then the hype died down and everyone realized that the movie obnoxious, derivative and [[TL;DR|LOOOOOOOONG]].

==The Ship==

The ship ''Serenity'' is the greatest source of [[serious]] drooling from fans. They get all aroused because the ship is mega frapping awesome compared to other Sci-Fi ships.  The best way to troll a ''Firefly''/''Serenity'' discussion is to talk about how ''Serenity'''s lack of time-travel capability makes it more realistic. Then sit back and watch the fun!

The ship ends up being mostly destroyed towards the end of the movie in a crash landing. The Dread Pirate Steve gets [[pwnt|skewered]] in the process by some sharp metal beams the zombie killers use. In the end, they repair the ship, but can't repair the geeky driver. [[Unfunny|Lulz ensue.]]
