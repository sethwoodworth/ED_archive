'''''Mega Man''''' is a [[perfect]] modern-day example of a [[Star Wars|franchise being mercilessly milked of all its worth]]. Originally introduced as a side-scrolling platformer in the 1980s, this [[bullshit|series]] still runs to this day and has [[goatse|expanded]] to a series of shitty RPGs, crappy 3D adventures, and the same horrible platformers. Each of these games are exactly the same in concept, only with slightly better [[photoshop|anti-aliased]] graphics with every new release.  Also, he can't crouch.  This nigger can shoot penguins out of his fucking hand, but he can't crouch.  Explain that.

=="Games"==
===Classic Series===
[[Image:Oilman rm.PNG|thumb|left|OH LAWD IS DAT SUM RACISM?]]
'''''Mega Man'''''
*This game is what started the mess. It had no save feature and no passwords, but [[lie|only 6 bosses]]. It also had a scoring system that was relatively useless and served no real purpose. Mega Man 1 also introduced the revolutionary idea of "Mandatory Cheating" by making it completely impossible to beat the final bosses unless you cheated by [[button mashing|pausing the fuck out of the game]] while attacking them.
:'''''Mega Man Powered Up'''''
:*A ''Mega Man'' remake, with [[shit|kawaii]] [[gay|chibi]] [[faggot|desu]] [[weeaboo|^______^]] graphics. Also, there are two new robot masters named [[Nigra|Oil Man]] and [[Time Paradox|Time Man]], and you can play as [[Shit nobody cares about|EVERY FUCKING ROBOT MASTER]] and even Mega Man's [[slut|sister]] AND [[queer|Protoman]]. [[OMG]]!  Also, the "[[gimmick|downloadable]]" stage packs are already in the game.  You're just unlocking them by "downloading" them.  [[Idiot|Genius]]!
{{-}}
'''''Mega Man II'''''
[[Image:MegaMan BadBoxArtMM.jpg|thumb|right|Official artwork from ''Mega Man Universe'']]
*The second game in the series added two more bosses, [[lie|bringing the total to 8]]. This was much better than the original, but that doesn't say much.  Along with cannibalizing the corpses of his defeated enemies like a fucking ghoul for their weapons, Mega Man's [[Santa]]-like creator and [[Pedophile|creepy]] father figure Dr. Light would appear and give Mega Man [[Dildo|special devices]] to use. These devices consisted of a rocket, a hovering platform, and a bouncing piece of [[shit]]. This game also introduced Energy Tanks and a password feature to save progress.
:'''''Mega Man Universe'''''
:*A remake of the second game, much like ''Powered Up'' was a remake of the first game.  Not only does it have a stage editor, but there's a also '''character editor''' where you can make your own shitty robots that do nothing interesting.  The only reason to play this remake is the fact that you can play as the Bad Box Art Mega Man from the US cover of the first game.  Oh, and [[Street Fighter|Ryu from ''Street Fighter'']].
{{-}}
[[Image:Top man.png|thumb|left|Jew Man]]

'''''Mega Man III'''''
*This was the first game that Mega Man's [[communism|red]] [[robot]] [[dog]] [[Rush]] appeared in. Rush had a [[cock|trampoline]] in its back, and could transform into a dog-headed jetboard or a dog-headed submarine. Both ran on limited energy, meaning the dog would frequently bail and let you drop to your death. It is also the first appearance of Mega Man's brother, [[gay|Protoman]]. Protoman had a scarf, a bike helmet, a completely [[Ann Coulter|useless]] shield, and a tendency to [[Rape|attack the fuck out of his little brother for no good reason]], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w6i70ztZKY just like a real brother relationship.] The release of ''Mega Man III'' was around the time when Capcom held contests where [[13-year-old boy|fans]] could submit their ideas for upcoming Mega Man bosses. This may explain some of the more fucked-up ideas they put in their games. For instance, [[boob|Top Man]], who could spin and looked like Flattop from [[dick|Dick]] [[trace|Tracy]]. There also was [[erection|Hard]] Man, whose name has too many [[13-year-old boy|cock jokes]] associated with him. Also he has a dial on his ass. Not only that, but Megaman 3 had the first robot [[furries|furry,]] Snakeman. [[butthurt|Fuck you, he's a snake.]] This game also featured quite possibly the most worthless of all weapons in ''Mega Man'' history. For beating Top Man, Mega Man obtained the Top Spin ability where he could spin in the air like a [[jackass]]. Somehow you were able to kill enemies with this, but you would always die in the process. And worse yet, this weapon was the only way to beat Dr. Wily at the end of the game. Either that or that retarded snake weapon.

'''''Mega Man IV'''''
*In ''Mega Man IV'', Mega Man has to defeat an evil [[Communist]] who was forced to fight Mega Man when Dr. Wily kidnapped his [[lolicon|daughter]].  One of the deadlier foes is [[Mexico|Dust Man]], a robot master who had the powers of a vacuum cleaner AND the powers of a vacuum cleaner in reverse, which essentially made him a [[whore|prostitute]]. The ability to defeat this amazing robot is considered to be a [[special|super-skill]]. Another villain was Pharaoh Man, who had the power to ignore your warnings until his first-born robot son was killed by [[Lowtax|God]]. Also of note was [[Original content|Dive Man]], who was basically an underwater version of Hard Man. This game also saw the introduction of [[what|Eddie]], the little red suitcase looking thing who would give you useless items, especially in critical moments of gameplay. Also the programmers thought it would be rich to stop recording your E-tanks with the password feature.

'''''Mega Man V'''''
*This is the one where that bird thing appeared. Also, Wily tried to frame Protoman for his crimes, even though he already did that before and [[failed]]. No one suspected that Wily [[obvious|was behind everything]].

'''''Mega Man VI'''''

[[Image:Megaman 6 mr x revelation.PNG|thumb|right|Such an intriguing <s>disguise</s> character concept.]]

*And now, [[lie|something completely different]]. Some guy who goes by the name of <s>Dr. Wily</s> Mr. X has been [[lie|controlling Dr. Wily from the very beginning]], so now Mega Man has to enter a [[Yu-Gi-Oh|tournament]] to stop him and his 8 <s>robot masters</s> weapons of worldly destruction. As fate would have it, <s>Wily</s> X reveals himself as <s>the obvious</s> Wily after his plans for world domination have once again [[fail]]d. Two new items appear in this game: the Rush Jet Adapter and the Rush Power Adapter. The Jet Adapter allows you to fly into every fucking spiked ceiling there is, and the Power Adapter allows you to knock down every fucking object in your path in a blind rage; both of which involve [[bestiality|fusing with Rush]] in typical [[DBZ]] fashion. [[shit nobody cares about|Note that these adapters are actually required to be able to reach certain parts of stages inaccessible by normal means, all for the purpose of obtaining Beat, who makes a recurring appearance for this game]].
{{-}}
'''''Mega Man VII'''''

[[Image:Megaman 7 intro just stand there.png|thumb|right|Mega Man doesn't [[DO IT FAGGOT]].]]

*This game followed the same basic Wily-will-take-over-the-world crap storyline, [[o rly|but with a twist]]. Apparently, Mega Man was successful at capturing Wily in the previous game, but has now escaped with the help of [[personal army|his robots]]. To make matters worse, Mega Man just STANDS THERE as Wily makes his escape. Capcom added several new features to this game: a new character who turns out to be emo (later ripped off by Sonic Team), Protoman returning to kick your ass once again, and they even decided to rip off the vastly superior ''Mega Man X'' series by adding an introductory stage and blatantly copying their password system. There appear to be only 4 robot masters, but 4 more are soon added, resulting in the [[lie|traditional total of 8]]. Eddie appears in this game, but (thankfully) he no longer gives out items. You now have to buy them from the store run by some frankenbot named "Auto". You need bolts to purchase the items, and there isn't really anything good from the start. If you want the good items, you have to find his Hyperbolt, which takes [[at least 100|long hours]] of gameplay to find, and then it takes [[over 9000|even more]] bolts to buy those items. This game introduced Weapon Tanks, or simply W-Tanks; these would refill weapon energy and you were able to carry up to 4 of these. This consequently [[bullshit|reduced the limit of E-Tanks to 4]], making the game several times harder than it already is; especially against the [[final boss of the internet|final boss]].<br/>It's also a noteworthy fact that this game is responsible for the creation of [[over 9000|several]] [[Photoshop|MS Paint]] [[webcomics]].
{{-}}
'''''Mega Man VIII'''''
*An [[awesome]] robot named Duo crashes into Earth after a fight in outer space against what is believed to be [[emo|dark energy]]. In his lifelong attempt to conquer the world by any means possible, Wily wants to use this energy for [[rape|his evil purposes]]. Capcom thought this game was so awesome, it got released onto TWO systems: [[Sony]]'s [[Playstation]], and [[sage|Sega]]'s [[fail|Saturn]]. It is important to note that it was the Playstation version got ported to the release of Mega Man Anniversary Collection, and is the version more familiar to the Internet, therefore rendering the Saturn version a forgotten failure in the sight of its own creators. This game isn't really different from the others at all, since all you do is run around fighting [[lie|8 more Robot Masters]] all in feigned effort to stop Wily again. Unlike the previous game, however, there are only 40 bolts in the entire game, making it impossible to buy [[everything|every single item in the shop]]. Also, following the tradition of the first game, there are NO ENERGY TANKS at all, making it [[THE BEST|the most difficult ''Mega Man'' game in existence]].
{{-}}
'''''Mega Man & Bass'''''

[[Image:Rockman Forte Bass select.png|thumb|right|[[trying too hard|Hardcore]].]]

*Originally released in [[weaboo|Japan]] on the [[SNES|Super]] [[wapanese|Famicom]] titled '''''Rockman & Forte''''', and then everywhere else on the [[GBA|Game]] [[shota|Boy]] [[future|Advance]] under the title '''''Mega Man & Bass''''', this game takes place after the events of Mega Man 8. Some badass android by the name of [[LINK_MAH_BOIIIII|King]] takes his [[personal army|army of Robot Masters]] on some sort of rampage. You soon find out however that this is all just Dr. Wily is up to his [[faggotry|shenanigans]] again. This game was essentially Capcom's [[uber|ultimate]] [[copypasta]], using character sprites from MM8 - they even went as far as reusing [[ninja|Tengu]] Man and [[ass|As]][[blow|tro]] Man - and abilities from the ''X'' series. Bass, now a playable character, is able to dash ''and'' double-jump, giving him an advantage over Mega Man in stage completion. Some of these stages were horribly designed and made as if the only playable character was Bass; getting through these stages as Mega Man was impossible at best. Like in ''Mega Man VII'', there are bolts that can be collected to purchase items at the shop, only without the stupid 40-bolt-in-game limit that ''Mega Man VIII'' had, and without the "[[ZOMG]] find my Hyperbolt so I can make better items" garbage that plagued ''Mega Man VII''. Interestingly enough, sometimes Auto would misplace a single bolt when making an item for you, which really made no difference at all as each item cost at least 50 bolts to make; that, and the price difference between items [[over 9000|far exceeded]] 1 bolt. Again [[copypasta|like ''Mega Man VIII'']], this game did not have any Energy Tanks.<br/>[[Some argue|It is rumored]] that [[lie|this game is the actual ''Mega Man IX'']], since [[logic|it took place after the events of ''Mega Man VIII'' and is the 9th game in the series]].
{{-}}
'''''Mega Man IX'''''
[[Image:Megaman9screenshot.JPG|thumb|right|[[LOL WUT|''Mega Man IX'''s next gen graphics]].]]

*Realizing that [[Retro|retrofag]]s were still worth marketing to, the creator of the ''Mega Man'' games decided to use pseudo-8-bit graphics in this game, thereby pissing off graphicfags everywhere, [http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/911/911740p2.html especially IGN]. This, both directly and by proxy, made retrofags [[cream]] their pants. It also has one Robot Master that is a [[what|girl]]. Dr. Light is the one who gets framed this time, by really fucking obviously Dr. Wily. It is also rumored to be almost as difficult as ''[[Battletoads]]''. Mega Man lost his charge/slide abilities, which caused mass fanboy [[bawww]]ing worldwide. Protoman has these abilities, but takes [[pain|double damage]] and has goes further backwards than his brother when hit, making him a total pussy. Robot masters include Jew Man and Concrete Man who teaches you the deadly Cum Shot maneuver.

'''''<s>Mega Man X</s> Mega Man 10'''''
[[Image:Otg9pg.jpg|thumb|left| You heard us.. it's a fucking sheep.]]
[[Image:Deformed lamb.jpg|thumb|right| Sheep Man RL (kinda reminds me of popcorm... yummy)]]

:It has a [[alexander4488|fucking sheep]] for a boss!  A fucking sheep.  Wily is running out of ideas already.  Oh, and there's some dumb shit about the [[Swine Flu|<strike>Maverick</strike> Roboenza virus]] or something...I dunno.  Protoman and Megaman will be returning along with a <strike>third character</strike> downloadable Bass (see ''Mega Man & Bass'').  Still in 8-bit!  The same day the game came out, [[hackers]] also found the three special stages had the Gameboy series (down below) bosses in them.  Capcom hasn't announced this yet, but just like with ''Powered Up'', all the data (plus Bass) is already in the game and fully playable.  Silly Crapcom, did you learn '''nothing'''?

'''''Megaman XI''''' 
(section is here just to be sure....)

===X Series===
'''''Mega Man X'''''
[[Image:ARMORED.jpg|right|thumb|Armored Armadillo broke barriers and anal cherries.]]
*Generally regarded as [[win|the best game evar]] on the [[SNES]], the game was also regarded as pioneering for including both Zero, ''X'''s first gay lover of the game and the first openly [[gay]] [[robot]] [[furry|armadillo]] in [[video game]] [[history]]. Both [[Nintendo]] and [[Capcom]] got a great deal of grief from [[your mom|parents]] and morality groups for this decision, but today most [[fags|homosexuals]] credit Armored Armadillo for helping them come to terms with their sexual preferences.<br/>The game also had robot faggots and a miniature Boba Fett with a ride armor fetish, for some reason.

'''''Mega Man X2'''''
*This game had the weirdest creatures, like a [[fucking]] [[Spengbab|sponge]], and didn't sell as well as the original. This is most likely due to the lack of [[homosexual]] [[robot]] [[furry|armadillos]].

'''''Mega Man X3'''''
*Some guy named [[shit no one cares about|Doppler]] and him and his robots go beserk, so Megaman has to kill him. Boba fette returns in another attempt to kill megaman. As well as these 2 faggots named bit and byte. [[duh|But in the end Sigma is responsible for everything]]. This is the first time you can use Zero but he's a complete [[pussy]] cause when he dies once on a stage, he'll be [[bullshit|"Too injured to help anymore!"]] leaving X to do the rest of the work [[sarcasm|(Yeah he's really fucking helpful!)]].

'''''Mega Man X4'''''
*This game is only worth remembering for the [[anime|fully animated cut scenes]]. Many fans went [[rage]] and [[BAW|BAWWWWWWWW]] after watching [[drama|Iris' death]]. This may not seem like a big deal in this day and age, but you really have to listen to the voice acting in these things to fully appreciate just how hilarious and terrible they are.

'''''Mega Man X5'''''
*Pretty much the same as the other ones but since the creators of Megaman [[Hates|LUVES]] Guns N Roses, [[trying too hard|all the bosses are based off of them]]. There's also this [[faggot]] named Dynamo who tries to stop X and Zero from doing the obvious and overused plot of stopping Sigma. [[buttsex|But we all really know why he's really trying to stop them.]]  This game also gives both our boys their biggest and best enhancement ever: [[What|the ability to duck]]! Too bad it's only helpful in [[Pwnt|killing enemies that weren't previously short enough to avoid being hit from a standing height.]]

'''''Mega Man X6'''''
*Considerd to be The worst one of them all, [[bagel|or was it X7?]] After Zero's [[not|TOTALLY UNEXPECTED DEATH IN X5]] X one day has a wet dream about him and Zero having [[sex]]. But then he wakes up and throws a tantrum buy smacking enemies with his [[cock]]. This game usally gets a review rating of 1-5 on [[Gamefaqs]] cause most of the stages involves either fighting the same fucking red donut, getting attacked by some giant robot, or getting killed by spikes.

'''''Mega Man X7 - X8'''''
[[Image:Aiieegghh!.JPG|right|thumb|''Mega Man X7'' showcases its amazing dialogue.]]
*Same thing as before. Fans declared the rest [[shit]]. On a related note, Megaman X7 not only sucked hard but also introduced a [[shitty|new]] character named [[13-year old boy|Axl]] [[Shit no one cares about|WHO HAS TEH MAGICAL ABILITY TO TRANSFORM INTO DEFEATED ENEMIES AND BOSSES!!!11]] which probably explains why he play the exact FUCKING SAME AS X. It also had voice acting just as bad as X4 and Megaman X 8 lets you play as Alia, so she can prove that she isn't completely useless, just mostly.

'''''X command mission'''''

*A crappy 3D Megaman X RPG. The plot takes place after X8 and apparently [[Lie|Sigma's dead]] so now [[fag|X]], [[Divide by 0|0]], [[13-year old boy|Axl]],[[An Hero|Spider]], [[pussy|Massimo]], Marino (a thief who despite being white we all know what she's really supposed to be), and some slut named Cinnamon save the world from some shit. After you'll get a key so you can get your ass kicked by a [[naruto|9-tailed fox
]] and for some reason, [[Resident Evil 5|the only black reploid in the entire series is a villain.]]
{{-}}

===Legends series===
[[File:Always Bet on Rock Legends 3.jpg|250px|thumb|right|You can always bet on Mega Man Legends being awsome!]]
Perhaps the best mother fucking series in the entire Mega Man franchise. With 2 games, one spin-off and another on the way, you can always be assured that each game is full of WIN.

===Series That [[Shit nobody cares about|Don't Matter]]===
'''Gameboy Series'''
*Also since [[shit|Capcom]] realized how their [[fag|fantards]] would buy everything with the name ''[[money|Mega Man]]'' on it, they decided on porting the first few [[NES]] games to the [[Gameboy]] system.<br/>Chances are [[you]] also bought those, although they were simply using rip offs from the [[NES]] games which you also own.

'''Other ''Mega Man'' Games'''
*There were other games like the 3D ''Legends'' one where Mega Man and Roll get all [[Incest|incestuous]] and save a naked [[Pedo|loli]].

*In that ''Battle Network'' one, Mega Man had to [[white knight|save the internet]] from [[over 9,000]] computer viruses that looked like retarded versions of their original counterparts; it really was the same thing over and over again, but no one really gave a shit. After this series rapped up, Capcom decided to appeal to the small niche that actually liked Battle Network by making Mega Man [[Star Wars|Star Force]], which was essentially the same shit but with 3D graphics and a main character with a tighter, skimpier outfit. [[Some argue]] that Star Force is the biggest modern shit Capcom has taken.

*There was also that ''Mega Man Zero'' one, where Zero gets sent into the [[future]] and is molested in his sleep by some dominatrix nympho [[B&|underage]] scientist chick and her pet [[fairy|Cyber Elf]]. [[Special:Listusers|Everyone]] agrees that Zero in a metal thong is hot, as is sleep-[[rape]]. Capcom also gave this one a continuation with the Mega Man ZX games, which were the same as Zero, but with the option to play as a brown-haired [[Naruto]] or his hot [[loli]] sister in the first, and a black guy or annoying [[albino]] in ZX Advent.

*There was also a [[soccer]] game, a RPG, a racing game, even a fucking computer [[lame|board game]].

==Media Vids==

===OKKUSENMAN!! OKKUSENMAN!!===
*<s>In [[2007]], some [[batshit insane|wacky]] [[Japanese|Jap]] created a rock remix of the first Wily stage theme in ''Mega Man II''. It will take you only about 45 seconds for you to deem as [[lie|one of the greatest triumphs]] on [[YouTube]], if you can understand the Japanese lyrics.

The following morsel was unleashed upon the web sometime afterward. It's about remembering life when you were a kid until it was a [[raped]] by a [[rule 34|merciless force]] known as adulthood. Listen to this song and you will become [[an]] [[weeaboo]]. [[George Zimmer|I guarantee it]].</s>


'''THIS JUST IN, OKKUSENMAN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MEGAMAN EXCEPT FOR THE OPENING SOUNDCLIP'''



===Mega Man vs. Furries===
*It is not [[goatse|widely]] known that Mega Man took part in [[kill it with fire|saving the world]] from the [[furfag]]s. This is likely the only useful thing he has ever done.<br/>Also note the third video contains the unedited segment of "HEY MEGA MAN YOU'RE A LITTLE LOW ON AIR! AND YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT!" in [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8IiJk4Imds GUTSMAN'S ASS].

==How To Troll Mega Man Fanboys==
*Spell Zero's name as [[Divide by 0|0]].

*Call 0 a girl.

*When 0's [[RAGE|cataclysm]] theory is mentioned to be proven false, claim that [[Azn|Keiji Inafune]] [[Shit nobody cares about|doesn't care]] about the series anymore.

*Say that Mega Man is a ripoff of [[13 year old boy|Astro Boy]].

*Claim that Mega Man [[Where is your X now?|X]] is an upgraded version of the [[Original character|original]] Mega Man. This will usually cause Mega Man [[fanboys]] to go on a full-blown [[Nerd rage|outrage]], saying that it doesn't comprehend with the storyline, despite the fact that the storyline is completely [[Habbo raid|overflooded]] with [[Michael Bay|plotholes]] and shit that doesn't even make any fucking sense.

*When discussing Mega Man 9, constantly remind fanboys that they [[Retard|spent money for "unlockable" characters and levels which were already included.]]

*Constantly ask fanboys when the [[Never|next Mega Man Legends game is coming out.]]

*Register Mega Man forums and spam [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|BURN BURN BURN BURN TO THE GROUND BURN TO THE GROUND BURN BURN BURN BURN TO THE GROUND BURN TO THE GROUND TO THE GROUND GROUND BURN BURN TO THE GROUND BURN BURN BURN BURN BURN BURN TO THE GROUND BURN TO THE GROUND TO THE GROUND GROUND BURN BURN TO THE GROUND BURN BURN BURN!]]

*Say That Zero or 0 Sucks

*Go onto youtube and tell the users whos names are something like IAMGUTSMAN that they have no lives

*Tell them that the Star Force series is teh best in teh wurld!

==Fun Facts==
*''Mega Man X3'' and ''X5'' ripped off an entire Guns n' Roses song, but they have yet to give a shit.

*Going to a ''Mega Man'' [[fanboy|fansite]] is a great way to see [[drama]] on the internet, particularly started by a retarded site admin.

*[[what|''Astro Boy'' ripped off ''Mega Man'']] (and went back in time to get a 30-year headstart apparently).

*The version of Mega Man featured in the cartoon ''Captain N: The Game Master'' is regarded by [[scientist]]s and [[historian]]s as being the worst thing ever.

*Capcom will never officially admit that Dr. Wily built Zero, even though every ''Mega Man'' gamer already knows this, unless they are [[13 year old boy|thirteen]] or [[fucktard|lick dust off windows]].

*In Megaman ZX advent you get a model named model A (The A stands for Albert). But people say that it's really Axl since he whines and gets on your fucking nerves just like him.

*The creators of Megaman desperately try to get into the band members of guns n roses [[gay|pants]] by making all the megaman X5 bosses based off of them and naming Axl from X7 after the [[wtf|band leader]]

*Megaman X7 is responsible for the unfunny meme of [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|BURN BURN BURN BURN TO THE GROUND BURN TO THE GROUND  BURN TO THE GROUND BURN TO THE GROUND GROUND BURN BURN TO THE GROUND BURN BURN TO THE GROUND BURN TO THE GROUND TO THE GROUND GROUND BURN BURN TO THE GROUND BURN BURN BURN!]]
