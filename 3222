'''Ganguro''' is a now traditional [[fag|fashion]] trend in [[Japan]] where the less up-to-date [[Azn]] girls (and a few [[pig bottom|faggy]] pimps) try to tan themselves as dark as they can, bleach and dye their hair to something vaguely resembling blonde, and wear bright makeup and flashy clothing that causes the viewer to have seizures. It's [[not]] [[cool]] and most of the apparently normal women think ganguro girls are whorish [[pervert|freak]]s, although their style bears a resemblance to that of women in southern [[California]]. Like [[punk]], the style has become increasingly bizarre with diminishing novelty. :(

Aside from wealthy US seafront retirees, other inspirations were the images of women in crap R&B bands like Destiny's Children, and the [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/blackandwhim/blackandwhim.htm Black and White Minstrels.] Talk about mixed messages.

According to [[Something Awful]]'s Dr. Thorpe:
:''They're sort of like the opposite of goths. Dark makeup [burnt over-tanned skin], white circles around the eyes, bleached hair, bright clothes. And somehow they're much, much scarier. Goths could learn a thing or two about true evil from these cats. In order to taste true darkness, you must trade in Bauhaus for The Vengaboys.''

The ganguro subculture is widely believed to be matriarchal due to the aggressive nature and characteristic insanity of its females, who often rely on cannibalism for survival.

== Origin ==
The name "ganguro" is derived from the Japanese ''gan'', cancer, and ''[[guro|guro]]'', ''kuro'', black. 

Kuro is also the Japanese pronunciation of the [[Italian]] and [[Mexican|Spanish]] word ''culo'', which is [[asshole]] in English.
