So, you're [[fap]]ping to some totally hot chick. She takes off her shirt. Hell yeah, [[tits]]! Down come the pants. Nice ass! And when the panties come off- [[Bakla|there's a cock]]! [[It's a trap]]!


==WTF is a trap==
A trap in short, is that which looks like it shouldn't have a cock but actually does. 

Traps come in [[mathematics|three]] [[gay|fruity]] [[blowjob|flavors]]: Transexuals,  homosexual men, and extreme metrosexuals. Many people enjoy traps of all varieties because they are [[bisexual]], [[gay]], or just really [[dickgirl|like chicks with dicks]]. 

The majority of traps will tell you they are traps as it is actually considered a "[[WTF|selling point]]" to some people. Even if feared [[heterosexual|in some circles]], traps are [[truth|gaining popularity]] and bagging one is considered a status symbol.

However, [[bondage|some will not tell]] because they [[sick fuck|get off on the power trip]] of "trapping" someone. These occur mostly in bondage settings and [[fantasy|pornos for closet case submissives]] that are [[you|too chickenshit to find a real dominant]]. [[Disregard that|Correction]]: these ''only'' exist in [[gay|homoerotic fantasies]] made by [[Japan|Sick fucks]].

The other reason a trap may not tell is because it felt you were [[retard|smart enough to have already known]]. Seriously: you found a [[faggot|"hot chick" that was interested in men]] in a gay bar. [[protip|What the fuck were you expecting]]? These [[you|sad losers]] deserve to be taking it from a man as only [[fag]]s would get so high/drunk they don't notice the boner under the skirt.

====Transexuals====
[[File:Veryscary.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[DO NOT WANT|no warning needed]]?]]
The [[Transexual]] flavor won't tell you they have a cock. Not all transexuals are like this as any self-respecting transexual women will tell you upfront if they feel a connection could be gained. In fact, they could shout "I'm a TRAP!" and get laid faster than by pretending a woman, which serves as more incentive to tell.

However, the ones that don't tell you there's no vagoo either usually hope you won't notice because they are strictly bottoms. After all, [[transexual|it doesn't matter if the plumbing doesn't match if she's otherwise all woman]], [[yes|right]]? 

While we're at it, don't forget the "late transitioners" who are so obviously men or former men that anyone not blindingly drunk can spot them. Those typically don't really care if you know and/or think you already know they have a cock. Most of them still tell as common courtesy, but [[I am dissapoint|if you didn't gather they have a cock before they told you, we need to talk.]]

====Trannies====

The [[Homosexual]] version is a dude who is a cross-dresser or transvestite. Normally the fags take the role of the woman when in private, acting as a [[buttsex|bottom]] and [[win|willingly giving head without reciprocation]]. They are so used to being the "[[woman]]" that they think you already know they're really a [[fag]] and are cool with things. You get what you want, they get what they want. No harm, [[no homo|no foul, right]]? 

Sadly, many heterosexuals don't know about the [[no homo]] rule and think that any sort of gay act makes you gay, even if the fag actually has titties and is just giving head.''' PROTIP''': It's only gay if balls are touching! Free blowjobs are awesome, but skip the [[buttsex]] unless you fancy catching [[GRIDS]].

====Extreme Metrosexuals====
There actually are a few very rare traps not gunning for the guys. These traps, AKA "extreme metrosexuals" or "straight traps", are men who have noticed that either....
# Lesbians are hot
# Women like traps, too
# ....Both!

So these guys dress like women, befriend the ladies, then pull out the "I have [[penis|penor]]!" statement as soon as he thinks the girl likes him in hopes that he will get laid. This tends to backfire most of the time with the [[fail|dykes running away]] from [[dildo|penis that isn't made of rubber]] and is not attached via straps, while the normal girls are usually too freaked out to bone him at all.

Some of these traps actually come out as traps from the start in the hopes that [[dykes]] will adore them or that [[bondage|kinky domme females]] will want to [[sex|jump his bones]]. [[truth|Believe it or not, it always works]] as women will come out in swarms, happy to have their own personal trap to share lingerie with.
