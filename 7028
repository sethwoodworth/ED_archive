[[File:Cyndre2.jpg|Lol, dunnage|thumb]]
Posterboy for why you should wear a helmet, Rob Levin spent all of his time chatting on the Internet and trying to get people to pay him to run the [[Freenode]] [[IRC]] network. He never held a real job and both he and his wife refused to work. Instead, they sucked at the teat of the federal government collecting disability. They claimed it is for [[ADD]] but we knew it was for [[Retard|more serious mental defects]]. Lilo [[White trash|lived in a trailer]], and was last seen convincing people to donate a quarter million dollars to buy a bigger trailer and pay off his student loans. Actually, he lived in a rather nice apartment and even had a Hispanic nanny while pretending to live in the trailer with a [http://web.archive.org/web/20061013185002/http://bloggage.org/archives/85-Flush-With-Problems-Part-I.html broken toilet] to get some sympathy so you'll help him buy a quarter-million dollar RV.

On September 15th, 2006, Levin [[#death|died]] from acute trauma suffered during an extensive anal BDSM session with [[JWZ]]. 

Rob Levin's death led to [[Anonymous]] getting sand in his vagina about [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and start [[ShutdownED.org]].
==Dunnage==

Dunnage is a phrase coined by known internet evangelist [[Rob Levin]].  He couldn't exactly be bothered with asking where this came from seeing as he is dead.  He was [http://lilo.ytmnd.com trolled to death by a car], causing serious [[A Plus|A+++]] [[lulz]] throughout the [[internets]].

DING [[Loldongs|DONG]] THE WITCH IS DEAD!

On 9/12 [[stabbington]] of [[bantown]] ran down his [[Gay|pink girls huffy]]. Saturday 2006.9.16, his [[death]] was lolcast to Freenode. 

<div style="overflow:auto; padding:0 .6em 0 6em; font-family:Lucida Console;">
-christel- [Global Notice] On the 12th September Rob Levin, known to many as Freenode's lilo, [[Rachel Corrie|was hit by a car]] while riding his [[bike]]. He [[Retard|suffered head injuries]] and [[Terri Schiavo|passed away in hospital]] on the 16th. For more information please visit #freenode-announce
</div>

Within seconds, [[trolls]] and [[h8|h8ers]] across the [[internets]] swarmed [[Freenode]] #freenode-announce and the many sub-memorial channels setup postmortem. 

Since he was liked by few and mutually disliked by everybody, many offers of condolences were offered in the #freenode-announce channel on Freenode (If by condolences you mean statements like "[[lol]]", "lilo was a [[fag]]" and "how can I run to be the next [[president]]???!".

Rob is survived by his husband Rico and two sons, Chip and Max. He will be laid to rest next to his brother, [[Mr. Hands]], who willed his prized stallion to Levin when he himself passed away. Interestingly enough, Hands also died from acute [[anal]] trauma at the hands of this stallion.

<div style="overflow:auto; padding:0 6em 0 6em; font-family:Lucida Console;">
<Meriwether> I disliked lilo<br/>
<ttuttle> Meriwether: I agree he was a horrible president<br/>
<Cowclops> you mean you can just call up the morgue and be like "is so and so dead?" and they'll actually tell you?<br/>
<Ankara2> give the county morgue people 1000 phone calls "Is lilo dead yo?"<br/>
<[[jesuitx]]> guyz im having a party tonight to celebrate<br/>
<GarethTheGreat> with no offence to any [[catholic]]s present - i laughed<br/> 
<Meriwether> Freenode isn't that important, and neither was lilo.<br/>
<taget> its not like a guy who irc'd in a trailer was a local hero

After [[Jesuitx]]'s first lilo metal track ended up an eerily prophetic prediction of lilo's slaughter, he and [[weev]] made a victory song about the brutal hit-and-run attack conducted upon Rob Levin. It is titled [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/images/7/7b/Delifelilo.mp3 Delife Lilo].

The liscense plate said [[YHBT]] and it was driven by [[weev]]<br/>
If anything I could say this hearse was rare<br/>
But I said nah forget it, you've been [[ruin]]ed
