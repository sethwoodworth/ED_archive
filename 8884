{{infobox Chan|imageboard_name=wakachan|imageboard_logo=[[image:wakaba_logo.png]]|date_founded=Originally around Q2 2004, revived as Wakachan in February 2005.|major_boards=[[animu|/a/]]|epic_win=weeaboo|homepage=[http://wakachan.org wakachan.org]}}

'''Wakachan''', originally known as '''Idlechan/iichan''' in its 1st incarnation, is an imageboard similar to the famous [[4chan]], only it makes [[romance|love]], not [[internet hate machine|hate]]. Wakachan is actually a collection of hosted boards dedicated to a delicate variety of stupid fucking [[wapanese]], unlike 4chan, where users actually discuss things not related to the admittedly [[Racism|superior]] [[Japan]]ese culture. The average wakachan user is a weeaboo [[wapanese]] who think they are [[otaku]] [[b/|/b/]]tards.

Upon its original foundation,it was one imageboard rather than a collection of hosted boards, much like it's mother site 4chan. It was originally intended to be a "home from home" for the nomadic /b/tards that were left without their daily dose of chaos and depravity after 4chan died for the 4th time on June 20th, 2004, due to various reasons. However, upon 4chan's return less than 2 months later, iichan had established it's own userbase, and ended up "competing" with its mother site. This was not to last, and iichan was closed on October 24th 2004 due to rising bandwidth costs and a lack of funding. it was slated to return in December, but in February 2005 iichan was permanently no more, and instead merged with another board to create the horrifying weeaboo infestation we see at Wakachan.
