'''The Great Livejournal Strikethrough of 2007''' is the self-important dramalicious name given to the mass (IRL l wish) deletion of poor-quality [[pedo]] and [[furry]] [[LiveJournal]]s starting on May 29, 2007 and continuing for round 2 on or about August 2, 2007.  The name was coined by the enraged pedos and furries themselves in the aptly-named {{ljcomm|innocence_jihad}}, where most of them spent vast amounts of time creating numerous protest icons and banners and decrying the end of [[nerd]] civilization as brought about by the evil owners of LiveJournal, [[Six Apart]]. '''The floods of hate mail from [[butthurt]] furries and pedos was the catalyst for [[Brad]]'s departure from LiveJournal.''' See below for [[sauce]]!

Exercising their constitutional right to free speech on a privately-owned web site, [[Over 9000|over 38,000]] ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and [[anime]] [[fag]]s joined a separate "protest" community, {{ljcomm|fandom_counts}}, to "show their solidarity" with their [[fandom]] [[otherkin]]. Since ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' had just come out, many of the oppressed used song lyrics from the movie as a rallying cry: "Yo ho ho, all together, hoist the colors high! Heave ho, thieves and beggars, never shall we die!"

Meanwhile in the rest of the world, [[breeder|heterosexual]] soldiers were blown to bits by roadside bombs, [[azn|North Koreans]] perished by the [[at least 100|hundreds]] in gulags, and [[Paris Hilton]] prepared to serve her jail term. But nevar 4get, ''fandom counts.''

==Sequence of Events==

===May 29, 2007===
* A redneck splinter group called Warriors for Innocence (spyware-laden site with srsly ghey banner [http://www.warriorsforinnocence.org/ here] they think people might want to steal), desiring [[Christian]] domination and the fame of [[Chris Hansen]], tells eljay's advertisers that their ads are being displayed on pedo journals.

* Advertisers pull their ads.

* Six Apart decides to nuke pedo and furry journals. About 500 journals and communities are deleted, including popular ''[[Harry Potter]]'' worship community {{ljcomm|pornish_pixies}} and a number of "[[fanfic]]", "[[pedophilia|age play]]", "[[shota]]" and "[[rape|survivor]]" communities as well as a community for [[Mexican]]s to discuss ''Lolita'' (the book) -- basically anything with child molesting listed as an interest.

* Nerds and chomo kid-sister-fuckers go [[batshit]].

* Meanwhile [[Ed Rodriguez]] is still using LJ to find teenage "roommates".

===May 30, 2007===
* Numerous protest communities are formed and the generation of new icons and banners reaches an epic pace, becoming reminiscent of the brightly-colored protest banners of the Vietnam War era.  And just as important.

* [[e-detective]]s [http://community.livejournal.com/dark_christian/830650.html deduce] that Warriors For Innocence is a Christian Dominionist group (see [[Zionist]], but for [[Retards|Jesus-lovers]], not [[Jews|Jesus-killers]]).

* Further sleuthing [http://suesviews2.blogspot.com/ finds] that one of the WFI "crusaders" is a batshit redneck with [[Confederate]] flags and anti-homo slurs pasted all over her blog.  She also supports [http://www.blogger.com/profile/01122159049927843800 Cary Cartter] as a write-in candidate for President. Cary Cartter happens to be a man with a girl's name and a zealot Christian Dominionist who lists ''[[Mel Gibson|The Passion of the Christ]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[Star Wars]]'' as his favorite movies and model railroading as his favorite hobby. SMARTER E-SLEUTHS MAY SEE SOME IRONIC PARALLELS HERE.

* [[b/|/b/]] [http://community.livejournal.com/innocence_jihad/63345.html raids] the blog.

* The CEO of Six Apart, Barak Berkowitz issues a statement to CNet: {{quote|Our decision here was not based on pure legal issues. It was based on what community we want to build and what we think is appropriate within that community and what's not.|Six Apart CEO and Jew, Barak Berkowitz|http://news.com.com/Mass+deletion+sparks+LiveJournal+revolt/2100-1025_3-6187619.html}}

* This whips LJ fandom into a freshly enraged froth because it means someone is telling them they're not wanted, just like in the lunchroom in junior high.

* The redneck Christfans gleefully e-taunt the horde [http://www.warriorsforinnocence.org/2007/05/missing-point.html here] and [http://americanandproud.net/?p=292 here].

* Late in the evening, Six Apart employee {{lj|anildash}} falls upon his sword and [http://www.metafilter.com/61636/livejournal-suspends-hundreds-of-accounts#1712054 posts his cellphone number] on [[MetaFilter]] so that hundreds of angry [[basement dweller]]s can [http://community.livejournal.com/innocence_jihad/66342.html call him].  They immediately start flaming him about a post he made [[last Thursday]] criticizing the Metafilter color scheme, using it as ''prima facie'' evidence that he is an evil corporate troll.

===May 31, 2007===
* Barak "bin Laden" Berkowitz ({{lj|barakb25}}) [http://news.livejournal.com/99159.html issues an apology] on {{ljcomm|news}}, posted to the front page of the site.

* Thus begins a [http://news.livejournal.com/99515.html series] [http://news.livejournal.com/99650.html of] [http://news.livejournal.com/100060.html posts] on {{ljcomm|news}}, all but the last of which hits the 5,000-comment limit with nerds cursing Barak Berkowitz and Six Apart, and furiously vowing to exercise their [[tl;dr|First Amendment]] rights on some other private web site pretty soon.

* Many pedo journals are undeleted.

===June 8, 2007===
* The fucking [[EFF]] gets involved, probably just to make the ''Harry Potter'' fans [[STFU]] and stop e-mailing them.

===June 2007 - August 2007===
* Over 38,000 Harry Potter and anime fags didn't leave LiveJournal, but ''did'' leave their protest icons up.

==Encore performance==

===August 2, 2007===
On or about August 2, 2007, Six Apart banned several more pedo "fan" journals including {{lj|ponderosa121}} for the image at right. Yet another fandom wank started on about [http://news.livejournal.com/102095.html?page=7#comments page 7] of the most recent post in {{ljcomm|news}}, including threats of class action [[lawsuit|e-lawsuits]] and hyperbolic [[unwarranted self-importance]].

===August 3, 2007 - LJ Employee Mocks Fantards===
{{lj|pirate_eggie}} attempted to start a meta-wank in {{ljcomm|efw}} by posting an [[ALL CAPS]] "insert content here" style post which sums up this entire article using [[over 9000]] fewer bytes.  The first comment was from {{lj|burr86}}, a LiveJournal employee who has written official policy posts on {{ljcomm|lj_biz}}. The comment was mocking towards [[pedos]], and of course, [[fandom]] took immediate offense. :) This sparked a [[crapflood]] of enraged comments, many in the original "insert content here" style. The entire thread has since been [[delete]]d, but is archived [http://never.draven.tripod.com/efw.htm here].

[[Copypasta]]:

[[Image:Burr86 mocks fandom.png|center|frame|O SNAP]]

The reaction eventually went as high as Leva Cygnet, who would like you to know that zie is [[unwarranted self-importance|a member of a Fortune 100 company]]. Zie posted a [http://firefox.org/news/articles/555/1/Livejournal-Employee-Publicly-Mocks-Fandom/Page1.html pissed-off article] about the mockery on [[Firefox]] News which included a link to the original comment (and later links to the [[copypasta]] once it was baleeted).

===August 6, 2007 - Brad's Departure===

[[Image:heil-six-apart.jpg|thumb|Angry pedos invoke Godwin in the August thread.]]

By Monday, August 6th, founder [[Brad]] had announced his [http://valleywag.com/tech/brad-fitzpatrick/livejournal-creator-leaves-as-six-apart-fails-to-spin-286218.php departure] from LiveJournal, stating he was "bored."  He later [http://brad.livejournal.com/2334177.html backpedaled] and claimed "that boredom isn't SixApart's fault."  Of "the latest [[CP|child porn]] debacle," {{lj|brad}} [http://brad.livejournal.com/2334177.html?thread=13866721#t13866721 stated] "...as far as I heard: child porn. [...] I heard about it for about 30 seconds just earlier today." Later:

{{quote|The flood of personal emails to me about this is a big part of the reason I realized that after 9 years, I need to find something else to do.|[[Brad]]|<nowiki>http://brad.livejournal.com/2334177.html?thread=13873633#t13873633</nowiki>}}

'''That's right.  <big>[[Fandom]] killed [[Brad]].</big>'''

==Notable posts==
