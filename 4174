Jack Sparrow
{{warning|text=Woops, forgot my hat}}

[[Image:Jack_sparrow_amy_winehouse.jpg|thumb|right|Jack Sparrow in action.]]
The protagonist of [[Disney]]'s [[shit]]-pile [[movie]] ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' is a terminally drunk pirate ninja captain played by [[Johnny Depp]]. [[13-year-old boy]]s the world over have since wished they could be the infamous [[goatse|pirate]] captain themselves, and perpetually stumble about, feigning [[alcohol|inebriation]] and using the sheer [[moron|cluelessness]] of their [[cosplay]] as a clever tool to outwit [[mom|authority figures]]! When not doing so, they tend to [[Role-playing|roleplay]] him in [[Pirate]] themed [[MMORPG]]s, and take some some version of "Captain Jack Sparrow" for their name.

Every Halloween from [[2004]] to the end of eternity, an army of Jack Sparrow impersonators shall roam the land, strutting and quipping lines about [[stupid]] [[shit]] like missing [[alcohol|rum]] and [[Buttsecks|taking it in the ass]] from the Lord of the Shitdicks himself, Johnny Depp, and [[Doctor_Who#Other_Actors|John Barrowman]].

'''[[PROTIP]]''': Go to Blockbuster and switch ''Pirates of the Carribbean'' with the porno ''Pirates'' (Blockbuster carries both). The covers are nearly identical to each other and are indistinguishable to parents who are in a hurry.
