If you ever needed proof that YouTube is a haven of the bottom of the barrel of humanity do to its easy access and relative ease of gaining exposure it gives its users, and that Atheist can be just as immoral, nasty, lying, scamming and stupid as any televangelist or mullah, look no further than Brett Keane.  Brett Keane is a 45 year old deadbeat wife beater who lives in a trailer in [[AIDS|Festus]], [[Missouri]] where he spends all day playing [[World of Warcraft]] and making YouTube videos every five minutes, while his heavily bruised and injured wife works to support the family.
Some may point to people like [[FakeSagan]], [[TheAmazingAtheist]], [[Inmendham]] and such as examples of self-centered, lying twats but they got nothing on the Keane.  Read further to see why.


==A little history==


Somewhere around 2000, Brett Keane first emerged on the internet with several shitty website attempts and message board accounts where he tried to scam his shitty Christian Goth novel books and terrible attempts at music.  Unexpectedly, he was banned from every single site his ugly mug appeared on.  But then, YouTube came along, giving every deadbeat, high school dropout and drug addict an ability to get an audience without putting any serious effort into it.  Brett Keane started off surprisingly mundane, making videos about science and atheism without even showing his face and in the most unoffensive way possible.  As his videos started getting more attention, it got to his head, and he began appearing on camera (to the displeasure of his audience), proclaiming himself "the sexist YouTube atheist" and making 400 videos a day, on every topic imaginable.  He mostly made videos insulting people for not being atheist and prank calling churches and releasing the audio online (which is illegal without the other party's permission) but it wasn't just that.  Politics, video games, [[irony|fitness]], nothing wasn't covered by this [[dumbass|genius]], not because he gave a shit or knew about this stuff, he just did it because he his videos to be the top rated in every subject.  Naturally, Brett attracted other creepy people with sedentary life styles, so as the his perceived fame went to his head, and he began blocking and insulting people believing his ass was bullet proof, these former fans went against him with a vengeance, which led to him getting extremely paranoid and releasing peoples personal information whom he was sure were behind all his troubles.  This led to the banhammer being levied against him, and him migrating to other websites, such as [[LiveVideo]] for awhile before they banned his ass as well.  Eventually, he tried several times to come back to Youtube, only to be told to [[GTFO]] every time, only recently managing to stay on probably because the site has new management or as just forgotten by now.  Expect him to get banned any day now.

== What Brett Keane consist of ==

Brett Keane (aka Mr. Toad) is an '''''"Atheist"''''' who posts whiny meandering vids on YouTube in between bouts of: 

*loafing
*plagarism
*writing appallingly shit "novels"
*writing up glowing reviews via sockpuppets on Amazon.com praising his appallingly shit "novels".
*eBegging
*wife-beating
*meat-beating
*pretending to be an intellectual badass
*behaving like an ineffectual dumbass
*Whining about his health problems
*World of Warcraft
*Denying he plays World of Warcraft
*tax evasion
*work avoidance
*history alteration
*projecting his faults on anyone who points out his faults
*practicing advanced smugness.
*Missing the point.

He is also deeply loves filing false-[[DMCA]]'s and working Pat Condell's pud into a lather.

To sum up: If there is a flaw or personality trait you despise, Brett Keane embodies it...and wants to slather it all over YouTube. The following vid by StraightDope sums it up:

==Brett Keane's Sockpuppets Shill for his Shit Novels==
Jobless-ass Brett supplements his income through "novels" sold through a vanity publisher. Good for him, you may be saying to yourself....at least he has some talent. Uh....no. The only way his unreadable tripe gets sold is if noobs on Amazon.com don't know his books are a smelly pile of illiterate ramblings.

==Brett Keane shows his love...with his fists==
It was bad enough suspecting that he beats his wife. But when you find out that not only his wife, but his MOM also felt the loving caress of his amateur MMA-fighter wannabe ass-kicking. His next bout will be beating up the corpse of his grandma, followed by roughing up some kinds at the pre-school.<BR>
Here's Brett trying to tell two different, mutually contradictory versions of why his wife filed a restraining order against Mr. Toad and his Pummeling Fists of Marital Bliss.

===Brett Keane & Wife, in the words of their loving sister-in-law===
"i have known brett for at least 18 years, Dawn for at least 20 years ( because she is my step sister). The truth about Brett and Dawn is that they are both LIARS. They where a match made in heaven. They will never amount to anything in there life except for being shit bums. Everything that comes out of there mouths is a lie. The only thing that they have to do in life is sit on the computer and spew there psyco babble bull shit. And trust me thats all it is is BULL SHIT. In this video they are dogging the step mother but that same mother bought them a car, moved them to a new state, took care of the kids when Dawn left Brett multiple times, took them money when ever they needed it. So ill let you make you own assumption about my mother. The only reason they are blaming her is because she cut them off. Now they are loosing there home and who do they call my mother. Asking to move in with her. So if one person is sooooo bad why in the hell would you ask a question like that. Again they are USERS and LOOSERS. So hopefully every one will get the message. And call them out on all the lies they have told"

==Block Brett Day==
A naked man proposes a new YouTube Holiday. This might be the only time a naked man proposes something to you that sounds like a good idea.
{{ytplus|A New Holiday for Everybody!|<center><youtube>X2zPea6P4EA</youtube></center>|
"Look, Brett, You're Wrong."|-- The last post before being blocked.}}

For those taking part in "Block Brett Keane Day" I recommend you block his OTHER channels as well: MREvilution777, BKROCKTV, TheStallion76 and BKwolfman999.

UPDATE Sept 5th...<BR>
And how does Brett react to having a new holiday named after him?

==How to troll Brett Keane==
*Call him a fat piece of shit. (He may pretend to be angry, but he really thinks of it as a term of endearment.)
*Ask him the trick Question: "When did you stop beating your wife?"
*Call him a fat piece of shit again.
*Say something true about him. He froths like a rabid pig when you do that.
