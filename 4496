Karmafist
'''Karmafist''' is a notorious [[Wikipedophile]] who is so easily [[butthurt]] by [[internet drama]] that he is the source of [[shitload]]s of lulz. 
==GTFO Wikipedia==
Karmafist is the source of many [[lulz]] as he is a candid critic of  [[TOW|Wikipedia]] administrators who [[MONGO|abuse their power]] and so has been banned [[at least 100]] times.

===[[Wikitheft]]===
In August 2006, on The Wikipedia Review, he [[stupid]]ly told people he planned to [[vandal]]ize Wikipedia with [[bullshit]] which even pissed off [[Everyking]]. 

===WTF did you say about [[TOW]]???===
Since August 30, 2006, he has been [[permaban]]ned from [[TOW]] for being mean to the poor helpless [[nerd]]s. [[Moar]] importantly however he spread links to two subpages of his userpage the first of which was his manifesto that on how to end abuses on [[Wikipedia]] which includes a petition that received over one hundred signatures. The second of which was his "wikiphilosophies" page about his ideas on how wikis, especially Wikipedia, should be run and how his ideas can improve them.

==Adminship==
Karmafist was first made an administrator on October, 11 2005 after his request for adminship (RFA) had 53 support votes and two oppose votes. One was from Boothy443 who with his high [[hypocrite|moral]] standards and [[Satanist]] values, told every RFA at that time to oppose because he thought [[MONGO|many of the administrators]] were [[domestic violence|abusive]]. The second was from the supremely [[butthurt]] Fadix who [[emo|was really sad]]  Karmafist was a big meanie to an administrator when he called him a "jerk."

===Banning Rampage===
On Christmas Day, 2005, Karmafist wrongly judged the administrator Mailer Diablo to be a [[sockpuppet]] and accordingly [[ban]]ned him. Mailer Diablo closes [[shitload]]s of votes for deletion every day and a user who created the [[fucktard]]ed name ''Regforafd'' nominated some articles for deletion [[at least 100]] of these were accordingly deleted by Mailer Diablo who also coincidently just happened to welcome ''Regforafd''. Mailer Diablo was later proven innocent of [[sockpuppet]]ing and Karmafist was sentenced to [[2 Years for Trolling]]..

===Do NOT challenge King Jimbo===
In February 2006, King [[Jimbo]] of Wales blocked an editor who was then unblocked by Karmafist resulting in  Jimbo desysopping him. Wikipedia's arbitration committee, being blatant ass kissers, decided that Karmafist would have run again for adminship again if he to be a sysop.
