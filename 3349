'''GivesMeHope.com''', or '''GMH''' for short, is a glad-handed [[hippy]] bullshit response to '''[[FML]]'''.  Instead of griping about the [[ironic]] twists of your [[fail|boring daily life]], readers are encouraged to post warm fuzzies for the edification of morons who can't find happiness in their own lives.  As these [[retards|people]] don't seem to understand that the essence of comedy is [[drama|conflict]], there are few [[lulz]] to be had.  [[Yes|Or are there]]?

{{quote|We love FML, but FML can be a downer. And we're completely exhausted by the negativity of the mainstream media. We're tired of hearing about what's wrong in this world. That's why we created [http://www.givesmehope.com GivesMeHope.com].|wat}}

==How To Troll==
Sure, you could think of a billion ways to generate lulzy GMH's, but do you have the [[l33t|skill]] to get it past the moderators?  Anyone can be crass or vulgar, and you'll probably end up trolling the [[basement dweller|few people who see it]], but to get it frontpaged takes a bit more of an effort (and possibly some friends to upvote it).

[http://www.givesmehope.com/moderate Click here] to serve as a moderator.  Not any [[you|douche]] can just spatter the feed with any nonsense, and entries are voted on to make it to the main page.  As this moderation is currently user-based, [[lie|it is totally un-trollable]].

GMH happens to use a versatile acronym.  It can stand for ''Gives Me Head'', ''Get Me Help'', ''Gave Me Herpes'' &c., &c..  PROTIP: Subtly working these spurious acronyms into your posts can help you [[troll|achieve your goal]].
