'''Verizon''' is a telecommunications company that is an offshoot of [[AT&T]] formed in 1983 as Bell Atlantic.  In 1984, the U.S. Justice Department [[partyvan|vanned]] AT&T for violating anti-trust laws and AT&T broke into several Baby Bells.  However, as the chart above show, the 1984 Divestiture of AT&T, the breakup was only an inconvenience for the folks at Blue Death Star. Not shown in the chart, Verizon's acquisition of most of Alltel. (Although 79 out of 105 markets were given away to AT&T.)  

However something happen.  Rather than being reabsorbed into the [[tentacle rape|tentacle folds]] of AT&T again, Bell Atlantic merged with several of AT&Ts competitors including GTE and MCI.

== Verizon Wireless vs. Network Neutrality ==
'''Cellco Partnership''' ([[powerword|d/b/a]] '''Verizon Wireless''') partnered up with [[Google]] to Jew the Internet out of equal access to websites.

On February 4, 2010, Verizon Wireless customers reported that they couldn't access [[4chan]]. [[Moot|4chan adminstrators]] found out that only traffic on port 80 to boards.4chan.org was affected, leading them to believe that [[ATT Blocks 4Chan|the block was intentional]]. On February 7, 2010, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan.org was [[Banned|"explicitly blocked"]].[http://status.4chan.org/index.html#2310965532000217917]

In August 2010, Google joined with Verizon on issuing a policy proposal that was [[BAWWWWW|critized]] by ten bloggers and journalists as damaging to net neutrality. [http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/08/10-media-takes-on-the-google-verizon-net-neutrality-proposal]  Of course Google and Verizon swear that they are doing this for the greater good.[http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/08/google-verizon-propose-open-vs-paid-internets/]

We'll see how that turns out if ED is still accessible after they fuck with the Internet.

== Verizon and Apple ==
Since [[at least 100 years ago]], Verizon has been trying to get [[Apple]] to let them sell the [[iPhone]], but due to Verizons Jew no deal was ever made. Verizon users are [[raging]] about not being about to have a iPhone on their wireless [[phone]] service.

==Verizon Passed on the iPhone==
In [[2007]], [[Apple]] was hoping that the Verizon Jew would suck [[Steve Jobs|Steve Jobs's]] dick and introduce the [[iPhone]]. However, the Verizon Jew found out about Steve Jobs's lineage to [[Adolf Hitler]] and refused to collaborate with Der Apfelführer.  However, AT&T was eager to support Steve Jobs's quest to exterminate the Jews.  Since then, the iPhone has taken over the [[world]].

The following year in [[2008]], [[T-Mobile]] introduced the G1, which did not make Der Apfelführer happy.

In [[2009]], two years after Apple conquired the world, Verizon signed on with [[Google]] and Motorola and HTC to introduce their [[Droid]] phones which ran the [[Android]] operating system. Der Apfelführer was furious!  Since noone bests Der Apfelführer, Apple begain to file all sorts of frivious patents so that Google, Motorola, HTC, Verizon, and [[you]] can't make an Android app that does something that you can't do with an iPhone because Der Apfelführer has created a Master Race of phones and demands that you only use [[iPhone]].

[[At least 100 years|FINALLY]] in October of [[2010]], After years of Verizon bitching and begging [[Apple]] to let them sell the [[iPhone]], Apple rejected Verizon time after time again due to Verizon being a Jew and not paying up. [[Steve Jobs|The Aids giver]] himself talked to Verizon and agreed to let them sell the [[iPad]] starting in [[2011]]. Though it's super fucking expensive, the only [[faggots]] dumb enough to waste $700 on a FUCKING HUGE [[iPod]] Touch are [[hipsters]], [[macfags]], and [[You]].

But still, the people at Verizon bitched and moaned even [[moar]] and so, now the [[iPhone]] has happened. Verizon and all those macfags won and now they will move to Verizon. [[Fail|Whoopee.]].

==Verizon Technical Support==
Verizon's [[Geek Squad|technical support]] is outsourced to a call-center company named [http://www.teleperformance.com/GP/Default.aspx Teleperformance]. Teleperformance used to be called CallTech, before they [http://www.ripoffreport.com/consumer-services/teleperformance-call/teleperformance-calltech-com-web83.htm stopped paying employees]. Teleperformance operates on the idea that if you hire 500 illegal [[Obama|Kenyans]], you can pay them minimum wage and still boast you have a [[technical virgin|call center in the US]]. The sad part is, the fucking illegal niggers know more about computers than the customers.
