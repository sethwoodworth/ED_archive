Hello Kitty
[[Image:Hellokitty2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cum_slut|Oh the humanity!]]]]

Hello Kitty was created by Sanrio, a Japanese company created solely to be an outlet for desperate [[16 year old girl|young women]] to recover some semblance of [[virginity|innocence]]. 

Those who actually find Hello Kitty to be an enjoyable, lovable character need to be euthanized post-haste, <strike>except for [[Gas Mask Girl|Gas Mask Girl]]</strike> DISREGARD THAT, NO ONE IS EXEMPTED, NOT EVEN THE ONES YOU FAP TO. 

Apparently, [http://www.netauthority.org/offenders/4260.shtml Hello Kitty violates the AUP.]

==Hello Kitty fan?==

Hello Kitty fans are easily identifiable; however they often are otherwise normal, probably goddamn retarded, female women. Another type of Hello Kitty fans, are those plauged with [[wapanese|wapanese syndrome]]. Usually, they are [[pedophilia|old men, pedophiles, uncles, or gaiafags who like to dress up as women]]

Usually somewhat [[basement dweller|shy]], these young [[womyn|women]] are usually revealed to be Hello Kitty consumers by accident. 

Oh, and the entire [[scene|Emo Scene Queen]] commmunity. They [[assrape]] Hello Kitty.

Often, someone such as a family remember will discover a small trinket, such as a pen/pencil, micro toy or lip balm with a Sanrio character, most commonly the egg-headed "feline" Hello Kitty. I'm not sure [[drugs|what they were on]] when they drew Hello Kitty, but I'm pretty sure it was actually drawn with an amputee's amputated foot.

When confronted, those stricken with Hello Kitty admiration will often reply, "Oh! I love Hello Kitty! She's so [[kawaii|cute]]!" 

[[Over 9000|In no time at all]], more and more Sanrio merchandise creeps through the normal possessions of a young [[cunt]] to form a veritable Hello Kitty shrine. 

Daily [[cut|blood sacrifices]] are made for good fortune, as well as keeping the fearsome Hello Kitty deity happy. It is believed that any item offered upon the [[kawaii]] [[wiccan|alter]] is devoured by Hello Kitty in her [[hell|fluffy cloud paradise]]. 

Many young Hello Kitty enthusiasts offer their "virginity" to their deity of choice, usually the sassy but personable penguin Badtz Maru. This is a symbolic offer, in which followers re-virginize themselves by pledging unending celibacy.

[[Image:PINHEADKITTY.gif|thumb|right|It's often thought to be [[emo|"edgy"]] to take Hello Kitty and [[photoshop|alter]] it to be something atypical. Such other "corrupted" children's characters also include CareBears made [[gay]] and [[goth]].]]

==Other Mutated Animals==

Sanrio also raped the image of raccoons, tigers, penguins, rabbits, other cats, puppies, fish, [[Your mom]], and [[Stalin]].

A surprising amount of [[lulz]] or at least uncomfortable irritation is to be had [http://www.sanrio.com/characters/more_characters.php here], at the Sanrio website. That particular link leads to the confusing page of characters, including an obsessive-compulsive raccoon and a panda made of APPLE which Hello Kitty poops out from time to time.

It's been twenty years since the beginning of the noble [[Jesus|crusade]] my personal [[an hero|hero]], Admiral Simon P. Scalesington led single-handedly. 

When he first saw sight of Sanrio's Hello Kitty prototypes he could see a [[future]] in which emotionally damaged women with histories of sexual abuse were not [[slut|promiscuous]] and free with their affections but instead found a way to recover a bit of a metaphorical hymen. 

Thusly he realized he must stop this adorable creature from gaining a niche market among women who previously would give it up to [[you|anyone]] who could take away the pain of previous [[sex|sexual]] encounters.  

He began campaigning with the earliest forms of the [[internet]] against Sanrio, claiming the company was run by [[pedophiles]] who commonly engaged in [[sick fuck|unnatural and unacceptable]] conventions of behavior including [[scat]], [[goatse]], and [[camwhore|camwhoring]].

After erroneously reffering to one exec as a "Size Queen," Sanrio struck back.

Releasing the un-[[lulz|lulzy]], unstoppable monster called Shinkansen. Shinkansen is an unstoppable bullet train with a relentless blood thirst quenched only once, briefly in 1987 during the Red Rains of Keralai in which the sky literally wept blood. 

[[Image:Landry_sanrio_hello_kitty.JPG|thumb| Landry the motherfucking adorable Raccoon! Jesus, look at the tiny ducky!]]

Shinkansen tracked Admiral Simon for three solid months before eventually finding and [[pwn|pwning]] him into the afterlife. 

It is now I, the noble [[goth|antihero]] who must strive in my fallen commander's stead. Though I strive day and night to conquer Sanrio and finally put Hello Kitty in a [[kawaii]] pink coffin, I still attest that Landry the raccoon is fucking adorable. 

I'm working on it, valiantly.
