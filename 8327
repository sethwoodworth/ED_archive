At first glance, ArtGoddess.com appears to be a run of the mill, [[shit|poorly-made]] [[100 years ago|Renaissance]]-themed website based around [[feminazis|feminist]] beliefs. While the glorification of trips to [[Canada]] and [[tits|breast feeding]] seem to be obvious themes, when the owner of the site- Lauren Sinnott- isn't using the word 'sumptuous' in every other fucking sentence, she's busy making bags fashioned to look like [[cunts|vaginas]].

==Wait, what?==

<blockquote>"You will know when you have found a good fit!"
-- Lauren Sinnott</blockquote>

Only a rung below [[Menstrual painting|Menstrual Painting]] (as her purses don't come with monthly refillable blood capsules), her collection was named 'The Velvet Vulva' which was soon shortened to 'the Velvet V' after [[you|internet horndogs]] kept finding her site through Google when looking for [[porn]]. Since her first flash of inspiration, Sinnott has been churning out these pieces of shit at a going rate of around $175 USD. The most expensive go for almost $400 and let's not forget that the more you pay, the more 'magikally significant' they are. As she has [[over 9000|nearly 40]] different photos of multiple bags, it's obvious that some batshit insane feminazis have bought her products to flaunt and to finger.

<blockquote>"More than a sumptuous Renaissance bag, the Velvet V represents in three-dimensional form the sacred portal to the feminine temple.

Each has sumptuous fabric labia and a beautiful button clitoris.

A Velvet V might become your everyday bag; it might always stay on your altar; or it might be acquired for special occasions. (One of the first Velvet Vs I made was part of the bridal trousseau of a close friend of mine.) Naturally, what you put in your Velvet V can have tremendous symbolic and magickal significance."
-- Lauren Sinnott - I can't make this shit up.</blockquote>

==Contacting Lauren Sinnott==
While trolling her is probably piss-easy due to the gratuitous amounts of personal information that she gives out halfway down her front page (which probably makes us [[Internet stalking|stalkers]], amirite?), one should keep in mind that her shitty excuse for a website hasn't been touched since 2006. One can only hope that she's curled up in a vulva-shaped sleeping bag and become [[an hero]].

So, what's next for Lauren Sinnott's illustrious fashion lines? Some theorize that the 'Cotton Cock', the 'Leather Labia' and the 'Silk Scrotum' are in production as we speak.
