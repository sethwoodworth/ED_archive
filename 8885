Wal-Mart
[[Image:Waldoprisonbitch.jpg|thumb|One of the fantasies of Sam Walton that started it all.]]
Where [[Satan]] resides. '''Wal-Mart''' ([[Lies|Save Money, Live Better]]) is a purgatory for desperate [[hillbilly|hillbillies]], filthy [[Puerto Rico|spics]], [[furries]] looking for stuffed animals to [[rape]], and [[oxymoron|Jews who spent all their golds]].

[[Unfunny|Wal-Mart was named after Waldo of the acclaimed ''"Where's Waldo?"'' book series;]] it was created [[at least 100 years ago]] while Sam Walton was at home huffing paint fumes and reading "Where's Waldo" books with [[Dragonball Z]] playing in the background. It was during a moment of epiphany, fapping to mental images of Waldo sodomizing Goku when he realized that not only did he pay WAY too much for his cans of spraypaint but that he could build a store based upon the economic concepts of cheap inhalants for everyone with a power level of [[over 9000]], thereby acting out his fantasy of Waldo-esque sodomy upon the retail industry of America.

When a Wal-Mart opens, the local economy is gradually destroyed. Hicks and shortsighted morons alike go there to save a buck, but they don't realize that the dollar they save is an investment in their own apocalypse. Eventually all the local businesses close, since local businesses have a thing about paying their employees a decent living wage and buying reasonably ethical stock, whereas Wal-Mart sells everything under the sun for half the price, because they buy in bulk and only sell cheap garbage made by five year olds in [[China]] or some such. The farmers are ruined because Wal-Mart only keeps food prices low by importing from a country where production can be done for a fraction of the price, due to things like limited environmental regulations, and a generally weak economy which lends to exploitation of labour (understanding that things like Wal-Mart are the reason the poor countries are such shit holes to begin with). Fortunately, when all the poor buggers who didn't know better than to participate in the forming of the evil monopoly, they can still afford to shop for cheap junk and nutritionally useless food harvested from clear-cut rainforest at the local Wal-Mart that ruined them. [[Liberal guilt|Er... okay...]]

[[Some say |There is reasonable speculation]] that Wal-Mart could actually be Satan's own cock, which has materialized on earth to rape us all, shooting fiery molten cumshots all over anything it comes near.

<br />
It should be noted that as soon as you send in your pictures, they will automatically start printing. Because of their stupidity, do not feel the need to have [[troll's remorse]], they deserve to be trolled.

If you find yourself IN the store, here is a list of things to do.
# Set all the alarm clocks to go off in 10 minute intervals.
# Start playing football.  See how many people you can get to join in.
# Make a trail of orange juice on the ground leading to the restrooms.
# Walk up to an employee and in an official tone say, "I think we've got a code brown in housewares."  See what happens.
# Tune all the radios to a polka station, turn them off, set them to Maz volume, and turn them all on.
# While in any department, yell "Who BUYS this shit ANYWAY?"
# <s>Put M&M's on layaway.</s>  [[tl;dr|Wal-Mart got smart and stopped layaway because people have credit cards now.]]
# TP as much of the store as possible.
# Randomly throw things into neighboring isles.
# Blockade an entire toy isle by setting up a full-scale battlefield with G.I. Joes VS. the X-Men.
# Take bets on the battle.
# When handling guns in the hunting department, ask where the antidepressants are.
# Switch the men's and women's signs on the bathrooms. <-- That doesnt work because the signs USUALLY don't move.
# Dart around suspiciously while humming the ''Mission Impossible'' theme
# When an announcement comes over the intercom, assume the fetal position and scream, "THE VOICES ARE BACK!"
# Go to an empty check-out stand and try to check people out.
# Hold indoor shopping cart races.
# Challenge other customers to a duel with tubes of gift wrap.
# Put condoms and\or pregnancy tests in random people's carts.
# Drive around the entrances screaming, "The British are coming!"
# Jump through a pyramid of cans yelling, "IM GONNA SAVE US FROM THAT BOMB!"
# Slip and fall with shit that breaks like milk, eggs, and so forth.  Make sure to cry in embarrassment at the mess you have made.
# Grab a whole stack of gift cards then use a non-working credit card to try and fill them.  Get angry at the cashier and ask to see a manager saying they are doing it wrong.
# Ask to speak with a manager at service.  When they come, ask them if they can have someone type an application for you at the job kiosk.  If they refuse tell them you will call the corporate office to snitch on them for you are disabled and can't type (illiteracy; basically perfect for any Wal-Mart job).
# Go to a phone (there are several hanging on poles or at empty counters) and press #96.  This will get you the intercom. [http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g-CWMyOCHHqygDurAK5M6908P_TwD9EGB4TO0 You know what to do].  << SOME Wal-Marts have a store number restriction. Check your recepit for the store number (I.E #5080)
# Make an attractive stack of pregnancy test kits and/or condoms in the junior-wear dept.
# If someones breath stinks, do them a favor and throw some Colgate into their cart.
# Switch the yellow price tags (''located under the item on the shelf'') to confuse customers on prices.
# Begin to cry and ask, "Why won't you people leave me alone?!" when an employee asks if they can help you.
# Hide in a clothing rack and yell, "PICK ME! PICK ME!" when a customer browses through.
# Set up a tent in the camping isle. Tell other customers you'll invite them in if they bring pillows from the bedding department.
# March out of the dressing rooms and, in an angry/serious tone, ask an employee, "Why isn't there any toilet paper in these stalls?!"
# Next time you hear the "Attention Walmart shoppers..." curl up into fetal position and scream "The voices in my head won't leave me alone."
# If you're an old person walk...as...slowly...as...possible.

== Sam Walton's Vision ==
[[Image:Walmartover9k.jpg|thumb|Sam Walton's vision come to life, with a power level of [[OVER 9000]]!]]

'''In the Beginning'''

Spurred on by visions of a cheap fix, Sam Walton decided that it was not good enough that he alone enjoy the benefits of cheap paint; no, he wanted to share this with everyone. He originally decided to open a simple discount spraypaint store, but Sam Walton found himself stonewalled when he realized that Sherwin Williams Paint company had already begun its dastardly plan to "cover the earth". After being assraped repeatedly by agents of the global paint conspiracy that is Sherwin Williams, Sam Walton decided to sidestep their monopoly by opening an entire grocery store and to simply pay a bit of protection money to Sherwin Williams for periodic shipments of paint.

'''The Wal-Mart [[rape|business]] Plan:'''

Being a native born [[troll]], Sam Walton couldn't help but giggle as he enacted his never-before-seen strategy of retailing, devised while being forced to watch crappy [[Lifetime]] movies about [[rape]] and [[incest]] with his wife:

1. Rape the shit out of (later known as "rollback") prices in small towns first. They are defenseless and totally [[asking for it]].

2. Once all the [[loli|small towns]] have been turned into metaphorical cum dumpsters full of cash, hire lots of illegal immigrants so that if anyone opposes Wal-Mart's expansion into big cities their rims get stolen and their girlfriends/daughters/grandmothers knocked up the next day.

3. [[????]]

4. [[PROFIT]]!

== The Results of Sam Walton's Trolling ==
[[Image:Sherwinwilliams.jpg|thumb|Sam Walton's first obstacle to success: The Paint Mafia that IS Sherwin Williams.]]
[[Image:Shoplifter.jpg|thumb|]]

[[Butthurt]] over being raped [[in the ass]] by the hellspawn of Sam Walton's deal with [[Mexicans]] and Sherwin Williams at the expense of everyone except [[furries]] and [[jews]], some people have begun anti-walmart campaigns during the hours in which they are not employed by wal-mart, buying shit at Wal-Mart, enjoying said shit bought at wal-mart, buying something somewhere else that was originally made for wal-mart at a second hand store to "stick it to the man", shoplifting from Wal-Mart, picking up their meds at wal-mart's pharmacy so they don't go [[batshit]] crazy, eating at one of the [[McDonalds]] that have begun popping up in Wal-Mart stores like genital warts or conducting business at one of the "convenient" banks popping up next to the McDonalds herpes sores like buboes. 

'''General Arguments of those suffering rectal bleeding from Wal-Mart:'''


# They give jobs to [[Mexico|illegal immigrants]], which is Un-[[American]].
# Their products are made in [[China]] and various 3rd world nations, thus unsupportive in the investment of American industry.
# Wal-Mart likes to kill baby deer when they choose new site locations.
# Wal-Mart believes in "community involvement".
# Wal-Mart insists on spelling the company's name in a cheer to adjourn every associate meeting in which they call the hyphen a "squiggly", thus undermining the rules of the [[Burger King|King's]] English. 
# Totally did [[9/11|WTC]] to sell party supplies with the American flag on, ed hardy shit, silkscreen prints of eagles with tears in their eyes, Jew-hanging kits et cetera.

'''Additional Repartee from the [[Butthurt]]'''

The communist retail chains also indirectly flaunt political messages to their customers. When observing a Wal-Mart receipt, you will find a subversive message:

[[Image:Walmart.gif]] 

Wal-Mart is no longer the largest corporation in the world (it is Exxon Corporation). Next on their agenda, the [[world]]. There is not one spot in America where there ''is not'' a Wal-Mart. The employees are the basis for the movement as they are the rejects of society. [[Old people|Old fart]], [[Mexican]], [[teenager]], [[basement dweller]]... if you're one of these, Wal-Mart has a spot for you.

Evil albeit cheap of Wal-Mart's evil tendencies is their respect for poor people. They give jobs to the elderly, build Wal-Mart's in the [[ghetto]], and offer their services to [[pedophiles]]. This makes every trip to the local Wal-Mart a trip into [[pussy|'''paralyzing fear''']]. [[Pregnant]] teenagers with nowhere to go often camp out in the tent sections of the Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is generous and forgiving when the political undertones of [[genocide|mass murder]]/domination are ignored. Praise Wal-Mart for its below the norm prices.

You can support Wal-Mart's movement to conquer the world, which is reminiscent of [[Hitler]], or you can opt for paying 3 cents more at another supermarket. The choice is yours.

'''Sam Walton's Response'''

Being a seasoned [[troll]], Sam Walton did not experience any sort of [[troll's remorse]] and shortly before his death issued the following statement to those opposed to his chain of stores:


{{Quote|I did it for the lulz!|Sam Walton, displaying the artful parry most used by the seasoned [[troll]] upon encountering the [[butthurt]]}}

==Walmartians==
The people who actually live at Walmart. Some are migratory, moving from one Walmart to another. Others sleep in the furniture aisles. Only about 23% of walmartians actually work at Walmart.
<br>'''Random facts about walmartians'''
*Walmartians can only breathe Walmart air, which has a particular mix of white trash bacteria, soccer mom perfume, and human body vapor.
*Walmartians get from Walmart to Walmart via special "Sub Urban Vehicles."
*Walmartians smell like damp flour.
*Walmartians Test shopping trolleys to destruction:
*Walmartians can only be seen from 12:00 to 6:00 am on weekends. For they cannot intake rays of the sun during the light of day

==New Logo==
[[Image:Walmartlogo2008.png|thumb|right|Changing your company's logo doesn't change the fact that you're an evil, manipulative conglomerate.]]
In [[2008]], Wal-Mart did away with their star logo for a sunburst in a [[pathetic]] attempt to improve their corporate image. Despite the logo change, they're still underpaying workers, discriminating against [[Black people|minorities]] (by employing them almost exclusively in urban areas with high minority populations?), [[women]] and manufacturing shoddily built [[plastic crap]] for the [[lemming]]-like masses to consume.

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' If you look closely at the white dot in the middle, it kind of looks like the [[World War II|imperial]] [[Japanese]] flag. Makes you think, huh?

==Acts of arson and murder carried out under the orders Wal-Mart corporate executives and CEOs==
In 2001, a family of six living in Colorado had a house on a piece of land that Wal-Mart wanted to build a superstore at. They tried offering to buy the house from the family for less than 1/4 of what their house was worth. When they refused, less than one day later, their house mysteriously burned down, killing everyone inside, including 3 young children. The Wal-Mart corporation then bulldozed what was left of the house and IMMEDIATELY constructed highly profitable Wal-Mart superstore on the patch of land that the house occupied. Investigators on the scene after the fire concluded that it was highly likely that arson was the cause of the fire, after finding suspicious items that could have been used to start a fire in the basement of the house. These investigators later mysteriously/conveniently died in strange one-car auto wrecks, bizarre suicides, and weird heart attacks/strokes/aneurysms immediately after eating or drinking something.

<b>Note: A link to this case from a reliable source would be very nice.</b>

== Wal-Mart: The Sequel == 

ASDA is the horrible mutated little sister of Wal-mart, much like the UK is to America. ASDA stands for ALL STAFF = [[niggers|DIRTY AFRICANS]] which is a reference to their staff who all seem to be [[niggers]] or incredibly old. Due to the fact that old people work at ASDA to just get out the house proves it to be a [[Jews|work of evil]] as it gives hope to old people to think that they have a place in our society. When it came to [[you|public attention]] that the Wal-mart family was recruiting people that were about to die theories burst out that [[Jews]] had taken over the branch and were stealing all the money, which isn’t very surprising.

ASDA is absolutely [[shit]] as everything is expensive and tastes of [[AIDS]]. It claims to be [[Lie|the cheapest supermarket in Britain]] when we all know that it [[FAILS]] and [[WIN|B&M and Tesco is cheaper]]

There only redeeming feature is that there is nearly always a Petworld next to it so [[you]] can continue [[you|your]] worship of [[cat|THE ALMIGHTY ONES]]

==Wal-Mart: Dealing with Recent Economic Downfalls==

Due to recent failures of large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Citi-Bank, Wal-Mart has also faced hardships. To counteract their largely profitable sweatshop from losing its money, after Thanksgiving corporate brass actually sent orders to over 90% of all the stores in the U.S. to fire all temporary workers (workers hired to work till right after Christmas and then they return back to the unemployment line) and employees that the management (disregard that they suck cocks for profit) deemed "useless" - when in reality that's basically any employee. 

They were unfortunately given a false illusion of a safety net job because, who gets fired from Wal-Mart, right? As they were sadly mistaken, they were all gathered like brainless sheep to their managers to face the fact that they are failures and must leave the premises immediately so as not to get v&. This caused an outrage in more rural areas but people don't give a shit so media attention was extremely poor and therefore no one knows. 

Wal-Mart has successfully trolled these "poor souls" and still gets away with billions of dollars. And also that those temps who were fired ended up spending their money right back at the place that fired them.

==Wal-Mart: <s>Not</s> just for white trash==
[[Last Thursday]] a New Jersey Wal-Mart faced criticism after someone got on the P.A. system and announced: "Attention, Walmart customers: All black people, leave the store now." White people quickly remarked "[[LOL WUT]]" while the aforementioned "black people" are assumed to have [[Lie|let the whole thing pass]], reasoning that this would be the best way to [[Don't_feed_the_trolls|avoid escalating the situation]]. Commenters on the situation quickly decided that this was yet another reason to hate Wal-Mart, republicans, and white people [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/17/wal-mart-investigating-so_n_502338.html].
