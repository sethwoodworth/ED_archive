Russian PhotoExtreme
{{needsmore|PhotoExtremes}}

In the process of slowly but surely learning how to internets [[Russia]] has spouted a new form of [[memefag]]gotry known as '''[http://world.en.cx/Addons.aspx?aid=340 PhotoExtreme]'''. As life in a [[fail]]ed [[communist]] country is not strange or dangerous enough, the objective of [[the game]] is to create, act out and photograph oddly specific scenes. Several of the photos soon spread around the internet, frequently confusing [[/b/|regular memefags]] who merely shrugged it off as [[3guys1hammer|Russians being Russians]], second only to the [[Japanese]] in sadism and general weird shit.

==Examples==
There are [http://world.en.cx/PhotoGalleriesAll.aspx over two thousand pages] of crazy images like these.

{{squote|
"A Cheating Wife: You need to make a photo of a man, 'a lover,' hanging outside a real window. The window should be not lower than the third story of a multi-storied building. 'A husband' should lean out from another window with a gun, aiming at 'the lover.' From yet another window 'the cheating wife' should look out in despair|}}

The first and most famous Russian PhotoExtreme to hit the [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|English-speaking]] world was ''Cheating Wife''. Originally thought to be a bizarre extreme sport or an affair gone wrong, this strange foreign meme was inventively named '''"People shouting at people with red shorts hanging from a balcony while someone aims a gun at them"'''.
