Captain Bill Robertson
[[Image:Cbr 10.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Ahoy mateys, it's Captain Bill Robertson!]]

'''William Robertson''' (born Aaron Pfefferberg) or '''Captain Bill''' to those who [[Moonie|loved him]] was a lifetime member of the [[Sea_Org|Sea Organization]] of [[Scientology]] and until he [[banned|left]] in 1982, one of the most influential people in the [[Scientology|Cult of Scientology]].  During his career, '''Captain Bill''' would pioneer many many fascinating [[aliens|religious programs]] for the [[Scientology|Cult of Scientology]] such as whether or not [[Aliens]] were coming to take over '''Teegeeack''' (Earth) through the use of [[Marcab Confederacy|Marcabian Invader Fleets]].  Due to his complete and utter fascination with [[aliens|"standard technology"]] Captain Bill was hastily [[banned|removed]] from [[Scientology]] forcing him to start his own [[cult|splinter groups]] to worship [[aliens]].

'''William Robertson''' was born on the 2nd of December 1936 in Georgia, into a family of ultra - orthodox Hasidic Jews. 

In later years, '''Bill Robertson''' would tell only his most '''LOYAL''' of [[retards|followers]] that he was not just a normal [[wigger|Earthling]] but he was indeed a space [[alien]] named '''Astar Paramejgian'''.  After word of his [[retard|identity]] slipped, '''Robertson's''' claims became more and more insane - once he went so far as to mention he was one of three beings charged with ruling the universe.  '''Captain Bill "[[LOLDONGS]]" Robertson''' has been divorced from several wives, who would later recount that Robertson was a hard drinking sex maniac who believed he was a [[lesbian]] and had a penchant for fucking himself with a corncob in front of mirrors while they watched aghast.

==Alien Beliefs==

===Sector 9===

In 1982, Robertson declared that the "Free Zone" would be established and his policy letter came out mostly as an infringement of the Monroe Doctrine written by James Monroe to the rest of the world [[at least 100]] years earlier.  However, being the diligent space alien creationist he was, this did not deter him from writing it or his [[retards|followers]] from believing it.
[[Image:Galactic-confederacy.gif|thumb|right|Captain Bill drew this map of [[Vagina|how the "Old Galactic Empire" used to be structured]].]]
*1. The planet known as [[Earth|Teegeeack]] - local dialect [[Earth|"Earth"]] or [[Earth|Terra]] - Sun 12, Sector 9, is hereby declared a [[batshit insane|Free Zone]].
*2. No [[anonymous|political interference]] in its affairs from any other part of the Sector or Galaxy will be tolerated.
*3. No economic interference in its affairs will be tolerated from any non-planetary agency or power.
*4. All of its inhabitants are hereby declared Free Zone Citizens and free of external political or economic interference.

===Ron's Orgs===

In 1982, '''Captain Bill''' decided that [[Scientology]] was simply not hardcore enough for him and was straying too far from the pathetic, insane alien beliefs of its founder [[Scientology|L. Ron Hubbard]]. So '''Bill''' set out to find an organization which he could use to his benefit to believe in bat-shit insane alien theories and be religious at the same time.  Having found that the [[Moonie|Moonies]] already existed and that some [[French]] turd had already started another UFO cult of his own, '''Captain Bill''' established The Free Zone, Ron's Organizations and Galactic Patrol.

===The Free Zone===

According to Captain Bill, Earth was part of Sector-9 and was established so by the [[aliens|alien rulers of the universe]] as a "Free Zone" where interference would be prohibited in the development of the intellectual and spiritual development of mankind (and sometimes womankind).  The group which '''Robertson''' founded was based on this [[batshit insane|theory]] and has continued to this day.  Although today the modern Freezoners are less UFO fearing and more reverent of simply the human soul, many today still believe that [[Dianetics]] can cure death, illness and is the way to reveal [[bullshit|catastrophes]] which didn't happen (but might have ...) through auditing.  

==IRL Problems==

===Suppressive Declaration(s)===

Shortly after leaving [[Scientology]] '''Captain Bill''' would be [[banhammered|declared]] by the Church of Scientology International as a [[marcab|suppressive person]] for attempting to pull members of the Church away from Marmoset brand "[[Nazi|standard]] [[AIDS|technology]]" to his [[aliens|squirrel brand of technology]].  This has been seen by many former and current members of Scientology as the only positive suppressive person declare ever issued.  The Church would later follow-through by declaring all of [[Moonie|his friends]] too.  In 1982 '''Captain Bill's''' [[terrorists|splinter-group]] itself would be [[pwnt|declared]] as well for being "some [[sick fuck|off-beat mockery]] of the [[Slavery|Sea Organization]] based on a distorted view of the whole-track".  [[tl;dr|In short]], this meant that '''Bill''' was [[trolling|teaching]] something other than standard [[Bullshit|Hubbard Technology]].

===Death===

Captain Bill Robertson finally succumbed to the throat cancer which had plagued him for several years on December 15 1991 and nothing of value was lost.
