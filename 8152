'''George Steinbrenner'''Jew aka the [[Final Boss]] of the [[New York Yankees]] was an [[attention]] whoring [[IRL troll]] and [[lulz]]meister of [[epic]] proportions. On July 13th, [[2010]] The Boss committed his final act of [[pwn]]ery by dying of a [[Hng|massive heart attack]] on the day of the [[MLB]] 2010 All-Star Game, thereby [http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2010/07/13/2010-07-13_the_boss_would_love_the_headlines.html hogging all the attention] away from the Midsummer Classic and owning [[ESPN]] in its entirety all day.

Upon reaching Heaven, The Boss' first official act was to [[fire]] former Yankees' manager [[Billy Martin]].

'''George Steinbrenner''' (not a Jew) started his [[MLB|Major League Baseball]] trolling career shortly after buying the woeful but once great [[Yankees]] from [[CBS]] (jews) for $8million in 1973 when he decided to fuck with baseball's "[[slavery|reserve clause]]" (where players were bound to their teams for life) and signed pitcher Catfish Hunter to a [[Jew Gold|megabucks deal]]. This, in effect, started the era of [[greed|Free Agency]] where players could go wherever they wanted -which was usually the team who gave them the biggest check. This [[butthurt|pissed off]] the baseball establishment so much, they immediately started hating Mr. Steinbrenner and went batshit insane [[lolsuit|trying to close]] the Pandora's Box of players' rights and [[union]] clout. But it was too late and besides that, Steinbrenner [[Colonel Quaritch does not give a fuck|couldn't give a flying fuck]] so the [[rich|loaded]] owner went about [[capitalism|buying up all the best newly freed talent on the market]] to restore the franchise to its rightful place as Kings of Baseball after years of jew neglect. And thus began an era of turmoil and hilarity to a formerly boring-assed sport and of the legend that was George Steinbrenner -the [[Final Boss|Last Lion]] of Baseball was born. George M Steinbrenner III: elite [[troll]], [[attention whore]], [[DGT|drama generator]], [[U MAD|butthurter]] and [[IDIFTL|bringer of lulz]].

[[tl;dr]]: During his career as '''The Boss''', Mr. Steinbrenner returned the [[win]]ningest sports franchise in history to its former glory. He did this by spending a buttload of [[Jew Golds]] to buy the best players who were willing to put up with [[usi|his shit]]. Said shit was quite considerable because from his purchase of the team in 1973 until his baseball second [[permaban]] in 1990 (after paying a [[Mafia|mobster]] to dig up dirt on one of the Yanks' most beloved players -Dave [[Win]]field (hoping to [[WTF|find an excuse to not have to pay money he promised to Winfield's charity)) he was a total douche who insisted on micro-managing the team to the point of calling whoever was the ''actual'' manager in the dugout to [[flame]] them for whoever was sucking on the diamond. Unlike most [[own]]ers, he also insisted on fucking with the team's General Manager over everything from trades to [http://bleacherreport.com/articles/419696-george-steinbrenner-dies-top-ten-hilarious-moments-as-yankee-owner#page/9 dental plans]. Whilst this is pretty much business-as-usual for most [[Capitalism|companies/organisations]], in baseball, it went against everything that [[handegg|the National Pastime]] stood for. However, The Boss [[colonel Quaritch|did not give a flying fuck]]: all he cared about was winning.

The Boss was no stranger to [[the lulz]] and his legacy includes [http://bleacherreport.com/articles/419696-george-steinbrenner-dies-top-ten-hilarious-moments-as-yankee-owner many memorable moments]. This included epic levels of [[IRL trolling]] from getting convicted and [[b&]] from baseball a first time in 1974 for getting busted fucking up [[Watergate|illegal campaign contributions to Richard Nixon]] (even thought he was a [[Democrat]]) to firing 20 managers during his first 23 seasons (well...15 since [[Billy Martin]] was actually fired 5 times) and 11 [[sysops|General Managers]]. But even though the Yanks were [[SFB|serious business]] to The Boss, he always kept a sense of humour about his [[trolling|shenanigans]].

==Bottom Line==
{{quote|George Steinbrenner was a [[cracker]] who made a lot of [[niggers]] millionaires.|[[Rush Limbaugh]]|[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/13/rush-limbaughs-steinbrenn_n_645046.html sauce]}}

Ultimately, The Boss will be remembered for turning [[EPIC FAIL]] into [[EPIC WIN]], transforming the sorry-ass Yankees into a [[Evil Empire|relentless winning machine]]..again. Apart from [[wizard|turning his $8,000,000 investment]] into the most [[profit]]able sports organisation in the world -a franchise worth $1.6 billion- he also added 7 additional World Series championships to The Bronx Bombers trophy chest for a total of 27. For [[Redsux Nation|those keeping score at home]]...that's [[New York]] 27, [[Boston]] 7. Also, net worth: Yanks = $1.6 billion, Redsux = $870 million. 

And this has nothing to do with the perceived [[BAW|inequity]] of [[Milwaukee|small-market teams]]' revenue streams being unable to compete with the [[New York|big]] [[Los Angeles|boys]] -after all, every team is owned by [[jews|multi-millionaires]] with corporate sponsors-  this is all about the willingness of a [[lol|fine, upstanding]] American Christian hero born on the [[4th of July]] to actually open his wallet to win at all costs versus some money-grubbing [[Jews]] like [[Theo Epstein]]  being unwilling to rub his [[foreskin wallet]] enough to give a shit about his team or city. [[Cry moar]] you [[Redsux|faggots]]. [[U MAD]]? = Jew.

He also managed to generate hueg amounts of [[U MAD]], trolling, butthurt and all manner of douchebaggery on [[4chan]]'s /[[sp]]/ board when a mod [http://boards.4chan.org/sp/res/6518987 made it a sticky]. In between much [[ROFL]] and [[celebration]] from [[haters]], Yankees fans held their heads high.
