'''''The Anarchist's Cookbook''''' was originally a [[book]] made by a hippie as a [[Why do you hate freedom?|protest against U.S.A.'s freedom war]] in [[Vietnam]]. The book's answer to U.S. imperialism was basically a bunch of "recipes for social change" that was directions on:
How to blow up your hands, get high off of household materials, hacking phones, and other such fun activities for [[leftarded]] youth to do in the 1970's. The book spawned a pre-internets [[meme]] known as "Bananadine". Bananadine was a [[copypasta|copy]] of a hoax from the Berkeley Barb in March 1967 involving a way to get high off of smoking banana peels. Despite this blatant misinformation, thousands of desperate teens have tried and claimed to get high off this for decades. But the biggest thing that the anarchists cookbook started one of the biggest and first underground internet-phenomenas in the days of the old dial-up [[BBS]] systems and [[textfile]]s that survives to this day.

==The Frankenstein of [[Textfile]]s==
Way back when internet speed was measured in Bauds and computers only had only 32k of ram, black-and green displays and cost thousands, a teenager copied ''The Anarchist's Cookbook'' to a textfile. Making textfiles from [[old media]] such as [[Paladin-Press]] publications and taking sole credit for them was a standard thing done by kids of the 80's. In fact, textfiles were the foundation of the early internets. When ''The Anarchist's Cookbook'' was made into a textfile in the mid-80s it became very popular due to it's [[angst]]-ridden agenda, drugs, and [[pyro]] material; making it perfect for [[teenagers|teenage]] losers. It was spread throughout BBSes and was re-made several times along the way, some of which allegedly by the [[totse|Temple Of The Screaming Electron (totse).]] Like a broken telephone this badly re-written manual degraded each time with the addition of more angst, bullshit, and additions to the already obsolete plans each consecutive one changing all the credits to [[attention whore|the last author who changed it]]. In a way it was made the way [[Wikipedia]] works: A teenage hivemind of people's failures copied/added to over and over creating a feedback loop of stupid.

It can be known as:
*"''The Anarchist's Cockbook''"
*"''BHU's Cookbook''"
*"''Pyrotechnics Cookbook''"
*"''Xoo's Cookbook''"
*"''Jolly Roger Cookbook''"
*"''The Terrorist's Cookbook''"
*''The Anarchist's Cookbook 2000''"
*"'The Guide to [[Xenu|Scientology]]"
*"'Can't get no pussy so I do shit like this cookbook'"

To get an idea of the mindset of the authors take a look at this quote from Jolly Roger:
{{quote|If I ever find out that anyone has omitted my name from 
anywhere in these files without my expressed permission, then I 
will immediately stop doing any updates and I will release your 
name to as many boards that I can find, urging them to put you on 
their Black List. I also, will FIND YOU! (I think you can see from 
the knowledge base contained in this collection that I DO possess 
the capability! You will wish it were the FEDS and not me!)|Jolly Roger, on [[attention whore|attention whoring]] for credit and being an [[internet tough guy]]}}

There are probably at least 100 versions of the textfile on the internet now since its first appearance on the internets 20 years ago, but most are have basically the same outdated, inaccurate, dangerous and stupid instructions.

In light of all of the obvious bullshit, errors and overall [[fail]]ure that is ''The Anarchist's Cookbook'', people still are trading the files on various "Anarchy" websites. These sites are made by [[13 year old boy]]s that are even stupider than the previous generation of teenagers who originally created them. These kids think Anarchy is not a political philosophy but rather an excuse to do stupid shit at school, [[vandalism|vandalize]] everything, make "Bombs", get high off of raid bugspray, and be overall little douchebags. In Web 1.0 most of these sites were on [[Geocities]] with plenty of flaming [[gifs]] and spinning [[Skulz|skulls]]. In conclusion, only use ''The Anarchist's Cookbook'' if you want a [[George Zimmer|guaranteed]] way to become [[an hero]]. Oh, and remember.....<big><big><big><font style="text-decoration:blink; color: red;">'''4INFORMATIONALPURPOSEZ ONLY!!!'''</font></big></big></big>
