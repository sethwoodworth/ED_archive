''It is believed that'' '''Callum Stockley''' was an eleven year old boy whose life has tragically ended on June 4, 2010, with a lolful [[vidya gaem]] related death which has improved both the [[British]] and [[360]]-playing gene pool. Young Callum's ''purported'' death -by accidentally hanging himself with the Xbox cable- gives him access to a very [[1337|exclusive club]] of gaming Gods alongside [[Jake Roberts]], who killed himself when he was denied to play with his wonderful Wii, and [[Brandon Crisp]], who fell out of a fucking tree when he ran away after his precious [[XBawks]] was taken away. 

However, the thing that sets this tragic game-related death apart from the others is that practically every sentence of every article regarding this event have the phrases “it is believed”, “it was heard that” or “according to”. At this point, if you think that the likelihood of someone hanging them-self "[[accidentally]]" with an [[XBox]] cable is pure [[bullshit]], join the rest of the club, buddy; even the [[old media]] thinks this one smells fishy. 

Folks, we have a little controversy here. Warwickshire Police are treating the death as ''"unexplained"''. A post mortem is expected to take place this week and an inquest will be opened and adjourned next week.

==The (Frankly Dubious) Chain Of Events==

''According'' to the news, Callum was a role model and a popular student in St Giles Junior School at the age of eleven. 

One fateful day, June 4th 2010, Callum was busy playing video games on his Xbox 360 sitting on the top of his bunk bed; now him being eleven, he was probably playing some shitty [[Sonic]] game. His mother then called him down for dinner. After he failed to show up downstairs for dinner she went upstairs to check up on him to see what he was up to. Shockingly, she finds her poor son hanging from the top bunk with the power cable around his neck (actual body [[Secks|position]] unknown).

{{squote|"[[Lie|Apparently,]] somehow he got the cable wrapped around his neck," said a neighbour. "[[No|It looks like]] he accidentally hanged himself."}}

{{squote|"[[Bullshit|The word is]] that it was a tragic accident" added another, who also declined to be named in the papers.}}

She, along with a couple neighbors and friends, has concluded that it was merely an accident. [[No|Right…]]

What has made this story more heartbreaking is that Callum had the ultimate army [[LARP]]er's dream. That dream would be to fight for his loving country by being garroted by razor wire by a [[Talib&]] towelhead [[terrorist]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Oh what a loss for the Coalition of the Willing. <big><big>:'(</big></big>

=="It It Believed" That Absolutely NOBODY Is Believing A Word Of This==

Of course there were no witnesses around to see how exactly Callum has died, thus stories based on this rely on what was believed to have happened. Could Callum have really died by accidentally hanging himself? Now, you must [[Bill Nye|consider the following]], the story is that Callum, an eleven year old boy, was hanged by a wire. That would mean that his body would be entirely supported by a single [[Microsoft]] power lead which would pop out of the socket if accidentally yanked. This wire was anchored to a game console. Said game console wasn’t even pulled down off the bunk by his weight when he was ''said to'' have hung himself.

The police are treating Callum's death as [[HA! HA!|"Unexplained."]] An inquest takes place toward the end of June.

''It is believed'' that once [[Phoenix Wright|Edgeworth and Gumshoe]] get access to the bedroom and have a chance to attempt to reconstruct the event as it is believed to have occurred, it is believed that those involved will have a world of uncomfortable questions to answer.

After all, as Chuck Palahniuk [[Guts|wrote:]]

{{squote|Looking back, kid-psych experts, school counselors now say that most of the last peak in teen suicide was kids trying to choke while they beat off. Their folks would find them, a towel twisted around their kid's neck, the towel tied to the rod in their bedroom closet, the kid dead. Dead sperm everywhere. Of course the folks cleaned up. They put some pants on their kid. They made it look ... better.|Though I'm not sure if these guys [[No|succeeded]].}}
