'''kat15lee''', or "Kathy," is a bored, thirty-something female who has a [[E-psychiatry|pathological attachment]] to all such manifestations of Web 2.0. as [[greatestjournal]], [[livejournal]], [[MySpace]], and many more. She lives in [[Los Angeles|Hacienda Heights]] with her imaginary dog Smokey, and loves the ocean, hot chocolate and walks on the beach. For someone of such an advanced age, she has hardly been anywhere in her life. A map on her greatestjournal page shows that she has only been to seven US states, and never outside the US.

One place she has never visited is the state of Washington, where Seattle is located.
