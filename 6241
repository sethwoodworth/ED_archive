[[Image:Maskedbubble.gif|thumb|right|At last revealed: the true identity of Pamela Jones]]

'''Pamela Jones''', or "PJ" as she is affectionately known, is a [[Failure|paralegal]] responsible for the administration of [http://www.groklaw.net/ Groklaw], a [[blog]] dedicated to uncovering the quagmire of the [[SCO]]/[[IBM]] debacle that threatens to shut down the development of [[Linux]].  Pamela Jones is an interesting animal.  A staunch supporter of [[open source]] [[warez|software]], she quit her job in order to record what she believes is the fallacy of SCO's legal case.  She also believes that [[Darl McBride]] wants to rape her, eat her flesh, and then deposit her remains in the Utah desert.

It is often thought that Pamela Jones isn't who she says she is.  Theories abound that she is either an [[IBM]] employee, [[Eric S. Raymond]]'s sister, and/or a [[Linux]] user.  Regardless, Darl McBride will soon reveal all.

Pamela Jones became the focus of attention due to her high profile cat fight hissy with [[Maureen O'Gara]].  After questioning Ms. O'Gara's ability to report the news, Pamela Jones became the victim of a tasteless stalking attempt on O'Gara's part, which was subsequently published in LinuxWorld.  Pamela Jones has since threatened legal action against Sys-Con, the publishers of LinuxWorld. Unfortunately, though, Linux is seldom used in any profitable venture, and Sys-Con has no money to lose.
