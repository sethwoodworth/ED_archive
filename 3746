American Heritage Dictionary defines '''Homestar Runner''' (or '''Homestar''') as: '''"toons and games featuring the wacky adventures of Homestar, Strong Bad, and the rest of the gang."''' Adventures? Checking our [[Email]] is an adventure? Whatever.

Homestar Runner was known for being a [[gay|clean]] [[lame|humor]] website. Which happened to include jokes about shit, piss, death, blood, and touching people in inappropriate ways. Then it died.

==Content==

Homestar Runner was known for its unabashed racist content. Grammatical incorrectness was a point of comedy based on racial characteristics and speech impediment, to the point where those who sound different are meant to be funny, making fun of several black/hispanic stereotypes due to their perceived inferiority by the more "intellectual" white authors, who point out the comicality of differing speech patterns as both simple and childlike in comparison, as a sort of impediment befitting the handicapped, who are also made fun of.  Black Vernacular English was shown as an ignorant, childlike, anti-intellectual style of speech for its comic simplicity compared to the more "normal" Caucasian speech, especially when white characters derisively use [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Hip_Hop hip hop] slang among regular speech, from the innocuous Teen Girl Squad using "Dag, Yo" to contrast with the all white cast, to the black narrator as comedic device in [http://www.homestarrunner.com/whereugoin2.html "Where U Goin'?"] 

Examples include:
 
*The character Bubs, with his raspy bassist voice, was a comical "George Jefferson" given to bouts of emotion and irrationality, while dispensing advice as a magical negro.  The blue skin tone and widened teeth give an "alien minority" appearance with the storekeeper role giving the impression of the homely local whose education was derived only from the streets, and must continually serve the Caucasian protagonists who are not restricted to their social roles.  
*[http://www.hrwiki.org/images/c/cd/CoachZ_Tupac.PNG Coach Z] was the stereotypical "wigger" who listens to Wu-Tang, wears a backwards hat and "Flava flav" style bling, and uses butchered hip hop colloqialisms to demonstrates the perceived ignorance and childlike quality of black culture through botched imitation ([http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/These_peoples_try_to_fade_me These peoples try to fade me], [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/New_Boots Hip Hop Dance], [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Rap_Song Rap Song], [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/All_up_ons The Z was All Up Ins]), showing that imitation of black culture leads to simple mindedness and deserves to be laughed at, compared to the assumed normality and superiority of white culture, in the same way "Malibu's Most Wanted" was an indirect criticism of black culture by "innocent" mockery.   
*Strongbad and Senor Cardgage both use their "funny" accents as a point of comedic appeal, as minorities who sound different are naturally funnier in contrast to the "normal Caucasian" style of speech, just as the Mexican wrestling mask was meant to funny for being both odd and foreign.
*[http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Homestar_Runner_and_Homestar_Runner%27s_Relationship Mental disability] and speech impediments are treated as a point of derision in [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/The_Interview The Interview] and [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Donut_Unto_Others Donut Unto Others].
*Strong Bad has no compunction towards mocking black people in [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/extra_plug extra plug], [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/garage_sale garage sale] and [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/pizzaz pizzaz], and considers [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Heavy_Metal Nordic and Germanic Metal] more [[nazi|pure]] than the music of black people. 
*In Baddest of the Bands, Strong Bad says the King of Town's Richard Pryor impression was too white, believing skin tone determines character more than individual action.
*In Strong Bad Email #69: Personal Favorites, in the knife fight with Pom Pom, Coach Z's line was "I'm a white guy with a knife!" This was changed within a week after the email came out to show the authors aren't racist.    
*[http://www.homestarrunner.com/main25.html Homepage 25] has an Aunt Jemima character criticizing Homestar as "whitey," intended as comedic since the uneducated mammy stereotype has no power to cause real change in regards to her social situation.  
*The rapper "3-D" has a song called [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Poot-Slap Poot Slap] to emphasize simple vulgarity in hip hop, while [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Peacey_P Peacey P] suggests black people are unintelligible, egotistical drug pushers who are too dumb to [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Trudgemank spell properly].

Yeah, they have a few of those. Thank God the characters aren't really all that human or else I'd see more of them [[cosplay]]ed and that would suck. They'd be like [[Star Wars]] fans, but trying to be [[stupid|funny]] all the time. The last thing I'd want when I'm at some convention listening to some better web animators talk is to have a Homestarmy of Strong Bads behind me [[MST3K]]ing the whole thing. [[I will have your humility|They would pay.]] Thankfully, this scenario doesn't really exist, because there really are no good web animators. At all.

Every Homestar Runner fan in existence claims they were the one who sent the Strong Bad e-mail "virus" to try to prove they're cool as if it's something to be proud of. Most message boards will see at least three newbies who claim this throughout the forum's lifespan. This is all total bullshit as everyone knows it was I who sent him the email!!!111

Now, you would think that a site with "toons", "games", and "wacky adventures" wouldn't have assholes as fans. And they didn't. Until the wiki.

The Homestar Runner Wiki makes Wikipedia look like Newgrounds in its fascinating [[typo|tenasity]] to destroy any and all [[lulz]]. IT'S A CARTOON, YOU FUCKS! GET OVER YOURSELVES.

Basically, the sole purpose of the Wiki is to [[OCD|obsess over]] every minute detail of [[Shit nobody cares about|the Homestar Runner universe]]. It's like [[TV Tropes]], but with even [[moar]] [[serious business]] and [[Asperger's]].

* In one scene of a recent Homestar Runner short, two Homestar Runners appear in one frame. This being an oddity until you take a look at the raw Flash File and see the one further out of frame has a mustache on. A page marked "Mustachio'd Homestar Runner" was created and was then merged into the article for the toon. This might not be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Talk:Mustachioed_Homestar_Runner this page] is the perfect example of people who [[fail]] at [[lulz]]. 
* The Wiki has a policy page known as S.T.U.F.F. (meaning "Stick Things Up yer Fuzzy Fundament"). The fun facts are the trivia, [[real world]] references, and goofs in each cartoon. Instead of allowing separate pages for each cartoon for people to freely discuss their own insights <INS>(Ok, some of them are definitely NOT insightful)</INS>, the members of this Wiki vote on whether or not certain facts belong on the page. Most of what becomes the "Fun Facts" are plain as the nose on your face and even they are argued over. Such [[in the ass|as]]
** The argument over whether or not the name "Silent J" was a not so clever reference to "Jay and Silent Bob". [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Talk:techno#Silent_J Stupidity Here.]
** In the email "Do Over" Homestar eats coins and a jiggly sound is made in his stomach. The night before on Family Guy, Peter Griffin ate coins and a jiggly sound is made in his stomach. This reference passes, which I could care less about and Jay decided to somehow challenge the entire STUFF process over this fact. [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Talk:do_over#Change_of_Pace_.28ACCEPTED.29 Ultra Stupidity here.]
**ParkingStones isn't so much trolling as pointing out the truth. [http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php?title=HRWiki%3ASelect_The_Usable_Fun_Facts&diff=0&oldid=93529 Super Mega Ultra Stupidity here]
** There are also tons of articles about how many times pizza or ice cream has appeared in the Homestar Runner universe. Seriously, what the fuck?
***Information about these topics are usually followed by; "This is another case of ice cream appearing in homestarrunner." (Next stop: leaves in "[[Charlie Brown]]" and forks in "[[Muppets|The Muppets]]".)

==Death==
[[File:Babysat.png|thumb|Missy's new baby, crushing any hopes of meaningful updates to the site.]]
After slowing up the pace of Strong Bad e-mail updates, focusing on a Homestar Runner adventure game, and then slowing updates in general, even skipping the holiday ones they like to do every year, by the end of 2009 the Brothers Chaps were looking for [[an hero|a way out]]. That way out came from a [[baby|parasite that Missy Palmer, Mike Chapman's wife]] contracted sometime around March 2009, and had nearly reached maturity. On December 1st, they [http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/FeedBurner_Page#Stuff_-_New_Baby_vs._Updates.21 announced] that Missy had another baby. What followed was two updates in nine months, cumulating on September 7th with an update that was basically a coupon, of all things. Now, it's possible that the site might be restored when the brat goes off to preschool, assuming Missy doesn't pop another one out in the meantime, but more likely, this is the end of the website, and the only thing stopping them from simply saying they won't put up any more updates is the hope that they can still squeeze some money out of any moron that buys merchandise from a website that hasn't had a significant update in nearly a year. At the time, they are doing a bunch of fucking shit, they had like a million babbies and they are making a movie right now. Homestar Runner still sucks.

==[[Dragon|Trogdor]]==
After hearing their fans say such things as [[Beastiality|"I'm fucking a dragon"]] to [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|"Fuck you, I'm a dragon!"]], the Brothers Chaps felt it would be necessary to create a cartoon with either [[Furry|dragons]] or [[Incest|fucking]]. Clearly, they made the [[Anti-lulz|wrong choice]], as Trogdor appeared as a result of [[Snapesnogger|Strong Bad's shitty art]]. That may have been the end of it, had the cartoon not ended with a [[gay]] song. The Brothers Chaps added it at the last minute when Matt started mumbling the chorus while taking it [[in the ass]]. HR fans everywhere collectively [[Circle jerk|orgasmed]] at the song and engraved Trogdor as their own meme. The song itself is [[unfunny]] and [[shit]].

Trogdor's status quickly fell to [[old meme]] when the next cartoon about bum-fucking was uploaded. Regardless, HR oldfags continue to [[Taliban|worship the dragon as their king]], ensuring [[Virgin|absolutely no sex]].

Trogdor was revived with the release of [[Guitar Hero|Guitar Hero II]], where the theme song appeared as a bonus track. The fact that the song was included induced some [[lulz]], but an equal amount of anti-lulz was released when people [[Unrealistic expectations|actually thought they could play it]] on their [[guitar]].

On Trogdor's 5th birthday, The Brothers Chaps told their entire audience to fuck off by completely ignoring Trogdor and dedicating a cartoon to the dragon drawn before him. Lulz and drama ensued, since every HR fan knows that Trogdor is [[Serious business|SERIOUS FUCKING BUSINESS]].

Seriously, though. Trogdor is made of [[Awesome|awesomeness]] and [http://www.smouch.net/lol win].
