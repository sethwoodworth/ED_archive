Dykepals
{{boring}}

[[Image:JohnnyrHEROIN.jpg|thumb|left|but I'm talking to her a lot and I would like to know what kind of person she is]]

The Undernet channel called #DYKEPALS is really full of dykes.  All they do is belittle, fight, and certainly [[pegging|hammer]] any newcomers.

The owner of Dykepals is [[johnnyr]].  However, his girlfriend [[scuzz]] is the real owner of the channels and rules johnnyr to the max.  If that wasn't enough, she is a psycho bitch from hell.  She will not tolerate any other females to be in the channel.  She will ban them, or demand that johnnyr ban them.  Which he does to follow orders.  Sounds like a dyke to me!!

There doesn't have to be any provocation, just simply saying "Hello" will be enough to get insulted.

It is note worthy that [[scuzz]] often changes her nick.  And if you should happen to join any channel that she is in... you'll catch hell if you are female.

Here is a brief argument between the two (yes, they live together, but insisted on fighting this out in the channel) indicating what a psycho bitch she is:
