Dreams are the second most deadly topic for visitors to personal [[journal]]s. Only bad [[poetry]] results in more reader fatalities. Some sadistic [[blog]]gers go beyond idle cruelty and render their dream recounts as poetry, making their web [[site]]s terminally toxic to any surfer innocent enough to read beyond the first line. Federal law currently prevents their extermination but new legislation is pending. 

[[Freud]] theorized that dreams are a revealing glimpse into the secret workings of the human subconscious. Examining this previously hidden realm via the [[internets]] reveals the human subconscious is mainly preoccupied with [[TV]] ads, scraps of [[porn]], and short clips from action films. This does not stop bloggers from sharing their latest dream in excruciating and poorly-spelled detail.

==Dealing With Dream-Tellers==

*Go post it on [[Dreamviews]], you freak.
*Look, [[fucktard]], shut up already about your stupid dreams.
