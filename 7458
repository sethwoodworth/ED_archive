[[Shining Force Central]] is a fan website for the [[Shining Force]] video game series; cool.  The owner is named '''Moogie''', she is a fat attention whore with a serious case of internet disease, bipolar, aids, etc.  The site is very community based - and yes, most of them do have [[Asperger Syndome]].  Don't believe us?  See for yourself.

== The Forums ==
The Shining Force Central forums are based off a heavily-extended Ikonboard 2.0 - a perl-based forum script programmed by Matt Mechem - well, that is, before he left to form Invision Power Board. lol.  The forum has it's own RPG store, avatars and more, even fanfics.

== Moderators ==
For in depth, see image, lol.
