'''But Data does not weight''' is a minor [[meme]] that started on Microsoft Answers (a [[Yahoo Answers]] clone) when some dummy asked if [[pirate|filling up his hard drive]] would [[logic|make his computer heavier]].

As there is a [[Star Trek|Star Trek: The Next Generation]] character named Data, what happened next was [[obvious|predictable]].  A person with a likely-pirated version of Photoshop popped out a picture of Data with "But Data does not weight" emblazoned on it.  This particular meme is not often seen in the wild, and as such, has no known variations.
