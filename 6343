People
'''HUMAN''' = [[Huge]] [[Ugly]] [[Monkeys]] Against [[Nature]]. '''People''' are a species of smooth, smelly creatures who populate the [[Earth]] and the [[internets]]. They are the third biggest source of [[lulz]] next to [[animals]] and [[dead babies]]. [[User:TheEvilBlueberryCouncil|TheEvilBlueberryCouncil]] [[hates]] them. While most creatures of [[Earth]] work together to form a better society, humans prefer to [[hate]] each other and disagree on every subject, [[hypocrites|even if they don't mean it]]; they just do it because they can. Humans also like to [[Murder|kill each other]] and [[Suicide|themselves]]. This is because Man's brain is [[over 9,000]] times the size of an apes and is too [[sleep|heavy]] to function properly. The word human derives from Latin "homō" which means gay; the "ō" at the end indicates that this more than just gay; thus, homō = "ultra gay".

== Diet ==
The diet of people is varied, and usually includes fruits, grains, nuts, vegetables, [[McDonald's]] and other [[cows|creatures]]. [[Vegetarians]] refuse to eat the other creatures because of the [[Slashdot|karma]], man, so they get an extra helping of lentils instead. Some people, especially [[16 year old girls]], have [[anorexia]] which means their diet consists of pretty much nothing at all except for maybe their fingernails and the occasional razor blade, leaving plenty left over for the [[fatties]]. (See also: [[Food]])

== Recreation ==
Aside from exploring the [[internets]], people enjoy hill walking, eating meat, stamp collecting and white-water rafting. Also the most favorite of these activities is the good-old sport "piss the fuck out of your neighbor", a humorous [[game]] used when a human has nothing else to do and feels a deep emotion known as ''malice''.

== Mating Habits ==
Humans are divided into two sexes, male and female.[[Image:Statuettes.gif|thumb|wimins have the tits!]] Generally, the woman signals that she is ready for sex by showing the man her bung hole.  The man responds by getting an erection.  Then the mating occurs just like in lower animals, except that the woman lies on her back with her legs in the air, except when resting on her legs with her butt in the air.  Usually this occurs only if the individuals are familiar with each other, and "special friends".  

For [[at least 100 years]] people have used [[sex]] for breeding purposes. During this time many [[sexual]] deviations (such as [[furry]] [[yiffing]] and [[arborphilia]]) have evolved. Curiously, most of these contribute no special advantage whatsoever to the development of the people gene pool. This is because the object of the mating act is to get the penis inserted into the vagina.  The actual selection of genes happens over long periods of time prior to mating, and involves candle light dinners and chocolate, so that the woman can see if the man she will mate with is really committed to the relationship or not. [[Over 9,000]] people in [[America]] have [[AIDS]].

Creatures like [[Chin-chan]], who can't use [[sex]] for obvious reasons, try to reproduce by buying [[sperm]] at sperm banks. The only [[losers]] at this situation are [[children]], who get picked on all the time, because they have [[ugly]] mothers.

== Warfare ==
[[Warfare]] is the humans' favorite activity. It has been so for their entire existence, even before people decided that things needed to be written down. Wars have mainly been fought over [[Freedom]], [[Pr0n]], [[Jew Gold]], [[Menstrual cycles]], [[Oil]] and the last ''Halo 2'' copy in the store. Two of the most popular wars were World War I and [[World War II]]. As a species, humans have never lost a war. Humans are extremely dangerous fighters and will readily fight to the [[death]], especially if you steal their [[weed]] stash, destroy their pr0n or call them [[fags]].
