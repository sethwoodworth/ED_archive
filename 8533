Tribes 2 is a game that [[at least 100 years ago| only about 100]] people have ever played.  Anyone who still plays it probably has a [[centipede filled vagina]] after playing a dead game for so long.  It was released in 2001 by Sierra Entertainment and still today remains as one of their biggest fuck-ups of all time.  Their other big fuck up is Tribes: Vengeance, but anyone who plays that has likely [[suicide| killed themselves]], so no one actually knows about it.  The main reason it didn't work out was because of its steep learning curve, and because [[counter-strike]] players ([[13-year-old boy]]s) couldn't grasp its three-dimensional gameplay.

== Story ==
It's all about [[gay]] men and [[furries]] (Bioderms) fighting for inter-galactic conquest. They don't want to just use high tech bombs to blow each other up, (seeing that it is the year 3941) but instead play fun games of capture the [[fag]] to divide up territory. The timeline behind it and the series is [[retarded]] and any attempt to make sense out of it will result in you becoming a [[LJ]] user.

== Armor ==
There are three types of armor to choose from while playing Tribes 2.  They all suck enough to make learning how to fly a shrike a neccessity for anyone who plays.
=== Light ===
Everyone who thinks they are good at the game uses this. It's the most mobile and allows for players to use the female warrior model. [[at least 100 years ago| About 100%]] of all people in Tribes 2 are cross-dressing [[teenager| adolescent]] boys, or 50 year-old farts who are terrible at the game. Many players will attest that they only use the female model because it is harder to hit, but this is a [[myth]] just like the [[holocaust]]. They actually use it so they can [[fap]] every time they make a good shot or kill somebody.
=== Medium ===
Anyone using the medium armor is either a [[rapist]] or thinks they are really good with a [[newbie| shield pack]].  You may also assume that anyone in medium is a black person because all they usually know how to do is farm.
=== Heavy ===
Heavy is by far the slowest of the armors, and everyone who plays in heavy armor only does it because they were not good at playing in light. You will always find them [[army| team-killing]] other players by aimlessly shooting mortars around the map. If you encounter anyone using heavy (which you won't because you will likely never play Tribes 2) just walk away.

== Vehicles ==
If someone ever gets around to repairing the vehicle pad, you might use a vehicle. You will usually find several people walking up to a broken vehicle pad just to walk away because they are too lazy to repair it. Here are the different types of Vehicles:
=== Wild Cat ===
No one uses it.
=== Shrike ===
This is an acrobatic flying vehicle that defies all [[physics]].  You can fly into a mountain at 200 km/s and survive, or ram into someone standing still and blow up.  People who use shrikes a lot are often accused of being [[pussy| pussies]] because god forbid if you want to have fun.  It also shoots alternating lasers but no one cares because they are too busy trying to ram people and running into hills/solid objects.
=== Havoc Transport ===
In the first few years of the game it was used heavily. People stopped using it when they realised that a big flying brick full of people is a favourite target of shrike whores and people with missile launchers i.e everyone, and equalled xbox hueg amounts of insta-points.
=== Assault Tank ===
See [[whore]]s.
=== Bomber ===
This is just a flying target that everyone can shoot missles at and blow it up because no one ever uses the tailgunner seat.  You will often find bombers blowing themselves up instead of actually hitting any enemy target.  The few players that can coordinate a successful bombing run actually just killed their team mates.
=== Jericho Mobile Base ===
With a name like Jericho, you can be sure that this vehicle is the most [[counter-strike| boring]] one in the game.  You drive it at about the speed of already dried paint, and then jump out.  That's it... then you just use it as an inventory station. Wooo!


== Weapons ==
Weapon(s)?  No one uses anything but the chaingun, if they don't then they might have some [[ball]]s and will repeatedly complain that those using the chaingun are [[whore]]s (see Assault Tank).
In any game apart from maybe Capture the Flag, though, the only weapon used is the spinfusor - because everyone thinks they are [[1337]] [[h4x0r]] when they hit you with it, and it kills light armor wearers in a single hit.  This is factual, since a direct hit is impossible without [[h4x]] or three hundred hours of practice.  Since the Rabbit form of gameplay involves one player in light armor [[rape|running]] from all the others, it is inevitably a spinfusor spamfest.

== Mods ==
There are several modifications (versions) that you will find in Tribes 2.  Of the five billion that there are, only four are actually played.
=== Base ===
This is the reason why no one plays the game.  People from Tribes 1 thought it was too slow, and people from the [[real world]] thought it was too hard.
=== Classic ===
Some [[douche bag]]s who still play Tribes 2 play Classic. Most of these people are [[elitist]]s who think they are better than everyone else who has ever played the game. The one truth about Classic players is that they are all [[infantilism|adult babies]] who whine and [[bitch]] at each other all day. None of these people have friends and should be avoided at all costs.
=== Version 2 ===
V2 players can be equally as repulsive as players from the Classic community.  There must be a coffee house in Amsterdam with the name Version 2 on it, because [[at least 100 years ago| at least 100%]] of v2 players claim to smoke [[drug|weed]] as it makes them cool to do/say that. You can also tell a V2 player from a normal [[human]] being from their ever hungering need to [[spam]] the chat window with [[unfunny]] voice-binds.  If you ever want to play Version 2, just make sure the map running is not called Katabatic (this should ensure you never actually play V2). Also, Katabatic sucks. Moar liek KRAPabatic, amirite? Seriously. The game has a zillion maps (like literally), why play the same dreary, snowy wasteland over and over for the last 4 years? Oh yeah, because you're all faggots who only one step above the classicfags.
=== Construction ===
This is all anyone plays any more, apart from Rabbit.  Also known as the 'Lego Mod', because you literally attempt to build things out of differently shaped rectangles.  For extra points, [[roleplay]] a town after you finish.  Since people only ever make things out of A) support beams or B) medium walkway tiles, there is no variety and everything is square.

[[Image:Tribes4_LOWELL.jpg|thumb|right|This game is not Tribes 4, because Tribes fans are [[retarded]] [[fanboys]]]]
[[Image:Section8_by_Idiots.jpg|thumb|right|This game is so Tribes 4 what with it being a big piece of [[shit]] and a fanbase of [[idiots]]]]
[[Image:Ripoffsection8transformers.jpg|thumb|right|This seems familiar.]]
[[Image:Stellar7.jpg|thumb|right|Back in my day [[games]] were actually good]]
Tribes 2 is the only Tribes game that can be considered a quality game if you're the type of [[idiot]] that enjoys [[Halo]] but with actual fun. However there are other games of [[faggotry]].
=== Tribes 3: Vengeance ===
This was actually a decent game but because of [[retarded]] [[fanboys]] all updates were cancelled forever making the only person that plays the game is a single [[faggot]] in [[Texas]].
=== StarSiege: Tribes ===
This game is so awful it's [http://www.fileplanet.com/140246/140000/fileinfo/Starsiege:-Tribes-Full-Game free]
=== StarSiege aka Tribes 0 ===
Like Virtualworld's Battletech but with more [[butts]].
=== Earthsiege 1 & 2 ===
Remember Mechwarrior 2? Yeah I don't either.
=== Cyberstorm and all other crap spinoffs ===
Ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
=== Stellar 7 ===
OH SHIT I LOVE BATTLEZONE... WAIT WHAT THE FUCK.
=== Section 8 ===
The best Tribes [[Halo]]-killer ever made by [[fags]] from [[Texas]] It's also Tribes 4 unlike the game below. The game prides itself on how EXTREMELY [http://joinsection8.com/ original] it can be what with having space marines that use jet packs on desolate deserts to fight evil bug aliens with laser guns.
=== Tribes 4: Fallen Empire: Legions ===
Despite being made by the same people that made Tribes 1 & 2 and built on the same engine of Tribes 2 this game is not Tribes 4 because it is not made by [[fags]] from [[Texas]]
