The '''Drama Yacht''' is a luxurious seagoing vessel whose existence was admitted on Mar. 5th, 2005 at 05:20 pm by [[hep]]: 

{{quote|I sit back, drinking pina coladas on the Drama Yacht with [[Jameth]] and [[Girlvinyl]] every day, talking about how we are going to fursecute some [[otherkin]], and invade a [[pro-ana]] comm.|hep, lording it over the peons}} 

Later, [[dramacrat]]s retracted statements about the existence of the Drama Yacht, and a cover story was put in place that hep was being sarcastic, but everyone knows the truth.
