Oh ok
[[Image:Im ok with this.png|thumb|]]
'''Oh ok''' is a sarcastic response used to depict disinterest in a subject. [[Some argue|Some would whine]] like little bitches that you can't read sarcasm, to which [[you]] should reply "Oh ok", hence the reason for this article.  Unfortunately for [[you]], whilst "Oh Ok" may be an appropriate response, it isn't a funny one, and for that, using this response will always result in complete [[anti-lulz|anti-lulz]] (ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT?).

This term has never achieved [[meme]] status and probably never will.

== Proper Application==
The correct situation in which to deploy "Oh ok" is after skimming something [[tl;dr]] in which you were supposed to show interest. This will elicit one of the following responses:
# The whiny bitch who wrote the [[shit]] in the first place will become an even larger whiny bitch.
# You will be ignored by the OP/"Author" but that's [[fail|your fucking fault]] for using something that isn't funny.
# You'll be exposed for the [[basement dweller]] that [[you]] are.
# Someone will advise you join Jessica Simpson and sign up for some Proactive.
# Life will take a happy turn for all of us as you (or the author of the article) becomes [[an hero]].

In any argument [[evar]] when someone says something stupid [[batshit]] crazy, "Oh ok" can be a appropriate response, but still isn't funny.  Not being funny is part of what produces the Anti-lulz, which we here at ED will never forgive [[you]] for.  [[You fail it| Shame on you!]]

==Anti-Meme==

Just because it's a universally well-known saying, doesn't mean it is a [[meme]].  That's right, [[Milhouse|IT IS NOT AND NEVER WILL BE A MEME]].  In fact, 'Oh ok' is just the opposite: it is an anti-meme.

Life Cycle of an Anti-Meme:

:::1. The Anti-[[meme]] is birthed from the womb of the [[gaiaonline|unfunny]].
:::2. The Anti-[[meme]] reaches out across to the far corners of teh internets.
:::3. Overuse of the unfunny causes it to slowly become one of the biggest [[Chuck Norris|cancers killing the internet]], second only to [[deviantART]].
:::4. The Anti-meme reaches the [[MySpace]], and is used in situations that revolve around [[IRL]] drama.
:::5. In some cases the Anti-[[meme]] has gone even lower and surfaced [[IRL]].
:::6. Those that gave birth to the meme ([[you]]) are filled with regret.
:::7. The Anti-meme lives on, spreading, and becoming [[moar]] and [[moar]] famous for the anti-lulz it produces.
:::8. The Anti-meme is used in every forum-based website across [[teh internets]].
:::9. The Anti-meme has it's name further disgraced by [[My Immortal|12-year-old fan fiction authors]], [[16-year-old girls]], [[Twilight|Twilight Fans]], [[IRL]] [[Pedophiles]], [[deviantART]] users and [[Gaiaonline|Gaiaphags]].
:::10. The anti-meme continues for [[Over 9000|Over 9000 years]], wallowing in it's pitiful existence until, eventually, it slowly fades from the lips of [[weeaboos|people]] everywhere.
:::11. It does society the only favor it was ever capable of and becomes [[an hero]].
:::12. [[????]]
:::13. [[Profit]]!!!!

=="Oh Ok" and [[You]]==

Whilst "Oh ok" is often the appropriate response to a lot of things, we still suggest you only use it sparingly. "Oh Ok" has been known to screw up whatever humor someone may have had going for them.  You ever heard of [[shit nobody cares about| Carrot Top]]?  There's a reason he's not funny.  And that reason is "Oh ok".  You know those old [[Chuck Norris]] jokes?  There's a reason those aren't funny.  And those reasons have to do with the phrase "Oh, ok."  You wanna know why things like Caturday and [[Mudkipz]] get boring and old and full of [[fail]]?  You can thank "Oh ok" for that.  

And don't think that saying a witty sentence before or after use of the phrase is going to make it any better, because it is not.  Anti-memes have been around since the dawn of time, and have had centuries to perfect their ability to make pretty much everything that had the potential to produce [[lulz]] a wasted effort.  Much like [[Anon]], [[teh internets]], and [[Camwhore|Camwhores]], "Oh, ok" is srs business, and should be treated as such.
