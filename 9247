After searching for the [[goatse|source]] of [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|AIDS]] that has been polluting the [[Internets|webs]] since [[at least 100 years ago]], it was soon discovered that [[newfags]] were indeed the culprit. Of course, this is not to deny that there exist no other sources of fail. Like a parasitic [[skullworm]], new <s>*chans</s> [[shit]] has been popping up all over the Internet as breeding grounds for the many legions of newfags who have yet to call the world as their own virtual [[sandbox]]. '''Ychan''' is one of them. I do warn you that before personally going to this website to check out the faggotry for yourself, that there is some shit that just can't be unseen.

[[Yiff|Y]]chan is yet another [[furry]] image board that was created by furfags... for furfags, because [[Fchan|one furry image board]] just wasn't enough. They presume that with enough *chan boards dedicated to [[furfaggotry|furry]] [[shit|pr0n]], [[newfags]] highly susceptible to [http://wiki.patrioticnigras.org/wiki/TLDR:The_Nature_of_Infection_in_Internet_Communities_and_Persons infection] will accept it for a [[lifestyle]] [[fetish|choice]] and an [[butthurt|acceptable]] [[internet]] subculture, instead of the [[sick fuck|sick fetish]] that all [[Anonymous]] know it to be. 

The thing that deviates Ychan from other *chans is the fact that users have the option to register to post. Otherwise, they can go Anonymous. Ychan should be visited only if you are either a [[furfag]] or a member of an [[HACKERS ON STEROIDS|elite force]] to troll the site by [[Tubgirl|any]] [[Funnelgirl|means]] [[Pain Series|necessary]].

Ychan? I say, Ynot-chan!
Each of Ychan's boards are [[Lie|diverse]] in their own subject matter.
*'''/m/''' [[Yiff|Male]]
*'''/f/''' [[Yiff|Female]]
*'''/s/''' [[Yiff|Straight]]
*'''/g/''' [[Yiff|Gay]]
*'''/l/''' [[Yiff|Lesbian]]
*'''/c/''' [[Yiff|Clean]]
*'''/ot/''' [[Yiff|Off topic]], or their answer to [[Random|/b/]]
*'''/h/''' [[Yiff|Hermaphrodite]]
*'''/r/''' [[Yiff|Requests]]
*'''/oe/''' [[Yiff|Oekaki]]

==Shit list==
Ychan is unique only because of its [[shit]] [[friends list|list]].  Otherwise, it would be like any other [[yiff|furfag]] image board.  Ychan has a set of [[divide by zero|impossible]] rules to follow, and if any of their members makes a mistake, they are picked out of the ranks.  Because furfag admins can be so easily [[butthurt]], this puts their members in constant state of fear of posting anything on the '[[do not want|do not post]]' list.  This is why all the "[[art]]" on ychan looks like a five year old drew it.
