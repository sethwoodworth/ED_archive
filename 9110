'''Wizard Rock''' (abbreviated WRock) is as old as rock itself (see Jethro Tull and Uriah Heep) but faded with the sands of time until recently when a new breed of faggots, overly enamoured with all things [[Lord of the Rings]] and [[Harry Potter]], awoke the slumbering beast. Songs in this genre are about characters and/or events written in the [[Harry Potter]] books and are, subsequently, full of [[FAIL]]. Wizard Rock is considered the largest untapped source of [[lulz]] to [[EVAR|ever]] hit the [[internets]].


==Current Wizard Rock bands==
Currently there are <strike>[[at least 100]]</strike> around 450 bands. The first Wrock band was Harry and the Potters, followed by the [[sarcasm|oh so original]] Draco and the Malfoys. Bands are usually named after the character they primarily sing about, and <strike>almost</strike> always suck. Here's a list of current bands: Wizrocklopedia- Bandlist [http://www.wizrocklopedia.com/index.php/band-listings]
