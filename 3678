'''Hells Angels''' is a [[religion]] started at least [[100 years ago]], when Brian Utsler needed riding buddies because all the bullies would beat him up at stop lights.  He searched through his friends list on live journal for [[fag|the strongest men he could find]]. The Hells Angels are most known for getting the shit beat out of them for making fun of Evel Knevel.

According to their official website, Hell's Angels feel bad about the attempted assassination of Knevel and are now trying to spread Patriotism to 3rd world countries. As you can clearly see, they have expanded.  

Recently, the Hell's Angels sued Disney.  A representative of the religion said, "It's not fair.  They get to push us around because they have more money.  They're just a bunch of meanies and want to take what's ours.  It [[emo|hurts]].  It [[buttsex|really hurts]]."

Utsler left Hells Angels and began a new livejournal.  He has revealed that he is also Brigitte Bardot and should be with Xander Harris.  Hate crimes ensued, and there have been no more "What type of dildo are you?" quizzes for two years.
