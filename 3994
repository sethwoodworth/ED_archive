In beta
[[Image:Web 2.0 style example.png]]

A program that is '''in beta''' or is '''beta testing''' is a program that some lazy shit [[programmer]] never [[Debug|finished]]. The program is slapped with the word "Beta" or is refered to as "in beta" to warn individuals that the programmer is a [[fucktard]] with no reason to live. The word Beta comes from the greek letter B;, which is a better grade than any of these programmers ever got at [[Computer_Science_III|ITT Tech]]. Also, if you're really eHip you'll attach beta [http://groups.google.com/ to anything] for higher eAppeal:

{{squote|That [[Microsoft|Micro$oft]] (software) is shit! [[Google]]'s (free software) is much better, <i>and</i> it's only beta!|[[fanboy|A typical slashdotter]]}}

Sometimes programmers give up and declare that "[[Bullshit|it is not a bug, it's a feature.]]"


== Beta in Gaming ==

[[Some_argue|It should be noted]] that some of the best versions of games are their Beta Versions.
Such as Warrock, [[Minecraft]], [[World of Warcraft]], and [[Steam|Counter-Strike Source]].


However, some games like [[Battletoads]] were never in beta.
