{{lj|user=goldenplate}} is a [[Captain Obvious|cleverly-crafted]] [[troll]] that claims to be a "[[Mormon]] [[Animu|Japanimation]] artist," going by the name Sarah Lawville.  She claims to live in [[irony|Salt Lake City, Utah]] She has infuriated the majority of [[Livejournal]] with her [[lulz|offensive]] shenanigans. Her entries mainly consisted of covering extremely touchy topics, such as: [[suicide]], [[child abuse]], [[homosexuality]], [[racism]] and even [[rape]] to name a few.

Sarah first burst upon the [[Livejournal]] scene, where she posted in the {{lj|user=gayteens}}, bragging about how she is "[http://community.livejournal.com/gayteens/672191.html free from the disease of Homosexuality]", and that everybody in the community be cured by "[[Jesus]]' loving Salvation".  This caused an instant uproar within the [[gay]] population on [[Livejournal]], causing those offended by her post to question whether [[goldenplate]] was a troll or not. D'oh!

She also ended up on [[LJ Drama]] with the aforementioned post, and is also a huge fan of [[hentai]].

The majority of the [[idiots|people]] that read her journal were offended gays, those who appreciated her journal, [[moron|Mormons]] who were insulted by her claims and even gays who saw through her and found her posts [[funny]].

==~* The Second Coming of Christ *~==

In late 2009, a new [[troll]] surfaced, {{lj|user=christ_in_a_girl}} which is a [[sex|sexually]] suggestive play-on-words to her real name, Christina Girlson. Supposedly, she befriended Miss Sarah and had her move in with her family, despite only meeting her [[last thursday]].  She is a lunatic [[Fundamentalist Christian|Christ-wanker]] who constantly writes poetry, professing her love for Jesus (which are pretty hilarious). Such posts are often written in [[gay|~*]] net-speak [[gay|*~]] In case you haven't put [[retard|two-and-two together]], this is also [[goldenplate]]'s short-lived troll journal.

Trolling posts: [http://community.livejournal.com/add_me/16703799.html ~* hi every1 *~] and [http://community.livejournal.com/satanists/142132.html ~* hi every1 *~]

As for Sarah, she ended up getting [[pregnant|knocked up]] by her ex-boyfriend Josh, who [[drugs|drugged]] and [[rape|raped]] her at a party.
