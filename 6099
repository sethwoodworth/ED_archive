October 12<sup>th</sup>, 1960 is a red-letter date in the history of political drama. Mere hours after Nikita Khrushchev banged his shoe on his delegate desk at a Plenary Meeting of the UN General Assembly while having a conniption, 17-year-old '''Otoya Yamaguchi''' (山口 二矢) assassinated Japanese Socialist Party head [[Leftard|Inejiro Asanuma]] with a wakizashi during a televised electoral rally.

In one of the greatest moments in [[Japanese]] broadcast television history, Yamaguchi - presumably energized by a diet of Yan Yan and innumerable viewings of jidaigeki films starring Toshiro Mifune and Tatsuya Nakadai - launched a running start off-camera, then slammed into and sucker-stabbed the politician as his thick dork glasses hilariously flew off of his head.

Amusingly, Otoya had co-starred in the Kaiju movie ''Sora no Daikaijū: Radon'' (空の大怪獣 ラドン) - or as it was called in the shitty USA version, ''Rodan'' - just a few years earlier. Rodan was some kind of flame-throwing dinosaur who flew around Japan fucking shit up, destroying the cities of Sasebo and Yawata -- but not Tokyo!

A couple of weeks later, while confined to a juvenile [[prison]], Otoya wrote [[WTF|a note praising the Imperial Emperor with toothpaste]] on his cell wall and hung himself with his own bedsheet from a light fixture, thus becoming [[an hero|切腹]]. [[Some argue]] that Otoya's choice to attack a politican vocally opposed to a common nemesis - [[The Jewnited States of Americunts]] - was the result of his own [[Sarah Palin|retarded right-wing]] sensibilities, which rendered him an unwitting tool of his nation's occupiers.
