Hogville.net is a site for Razorback news, information, and various [[homosexual]]ity contests that are encouraged and participated in by the [[mod]]s and [[admin]]s.

== Brief History ==
Hogville was born on, hell, I don't know when it was. Who gives a fuck, really. There still are only five personalities on the board, who all engage in overzealous authoritarianism and inconsistent posting.

Signing day of February 2004 was a major coup for the site, with a boom in interest and two new members.  Hogville was able to offer breakback news and information, which has since become a trademark, as well as a new perspective on Razorback sports: sports talk without mentality, rah-rah [[bullshit]] [[homosexual|homer]] views, and a Razorback history section with numerous photos of [[MILF|razorbacks]].

Since then, Hogville has grown at a steady clip, to averaging more traffic and posters than any other Razorback sports website. Hogville has also expanded into radio, and top-notch tailgating before and after Razorback sporting events where good [[Beer|food]] and good fellowship can be found, known as Tailgate Central.

From its humble beginnings to the site it is today, Hogville.net has emerged as the leading Arkansas Razorback sports website. Trips to Vegas by members are also planned, but [[bestiality|what happens in Vegas]], stays in Vegas. We sure won't say anything about Richard's run-in with a brutish, but sweet [[transsexual]].
