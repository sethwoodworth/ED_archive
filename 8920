[[Image:Washington Faggots.png|right|thumb|What Washington thinks [[Truth|of the rest of the country]].]]

A state in the northwestern U.S. that nobody cares about, Washington is vapid and devoid of meaning. Most citizens hate themselves because they [[fail]] at being as important as [[Washington, DC]]. It's slightly less of a shithole than Oregon, though still not quite as interesting as [[Wyoming]]. However, they do boast the Space Needle, the largest [[art|abstract]] impression of a <strike>[[Drug|hypodermic needle]]</strike> [[Shrooms|magic mushroom]] in the United States. It is famous for having good coffee and lots of rich, generous [[White People|people of various races]], as well as having some of the most famous musicians ever. It is also widely regarded as being a nice place to live, Seattle being ranked #3 in the cities Americans would like to live in most, falling behind Detroit and Chicago. It is commonly accepted knowledge that all women from Washington have exceedingly <strike>massive</strike> giant [[penis|cocks]]. It rains 362 days a year in [[Communism|Western Washington]], but the [[Snoop Dogg|East Side]] is composed mainly of desert, trees, rednecks, and [[lolwut|confederate flags]].

It should also be mentioned that Washington state is the unholy breeding ground of America's favorite narcissistic sociopaths. Everyone loves a Ted Bundy and Washington is crawling with them.

'''[[PROTIP]]: Don't go to Washington.''' - Save yourself the trip, if you want Washington coffee, try [[Starbucks]].

==History==
Washington state was created [[last thursday|November 11, 1889]]. Russians explored the region a long time ago and planted the now flourishing seed of [[Marijuana]]. Then it was home to many [[lie|friendly]] [[Native Americans]] who got [[rape|raped]] by a bunch of [[newfags|settlers]] who moved in and started [[Starbucks]]. Since then, nothing has happened except for "The [[ghey|Dandy]] [[faggots|Warhol]]s", the state's most embarrassing cultural achievement.

==Two Washingtons?==
Washington is divided by a huge-[[buttsex|ass fucking]] mountain range that is [[true|nearly impassable]]. Life on the two sides of the range are as different as [[God]] and [[Satan]].  
*The west is full of [[White People|rich people]], [[hippies|environmentalists]], [[liberals|activists]], [[Wapanese]], [[yuppies|hardworking Americans]], [[emo|artistic youth]], [[indie|aspiring musicians]], [[homosexuality|gay crossdressers]], [[Mexicans|illegal immigrants]], [[Goth|aging Goths]], [[Graffiti|artists]], [[Nerd|computer geeks]] and [[niggers|the culturally diverse]].
*The east consists of [[redneck|mechanical engineers]], [[white people|farmers]], [[Republicunt|wholesome All-American families]], and [[DAMN NIGGA]]

==Two Vancouvers?==
There is a town in Southwest, Washington called [[shit|Vancouver]], not to be confused with [[Vancouver|Vancouver, Canada]] which is [[true|a trillion times more interesting.]] Unlike the rest of Washington which is just boring, America's Vancouver is so [[lame]], [[gay]], and [[pointless]] that the most famous person in Vancouver is [[User:Scissorfish|the guy who holds the sign for the Little Caesar's on 4th Plain]], a guy who happens to make more money in tips on a weekly basis than [[you]] do in a [[McDonald's|whole paycheck.]] Despite being a huge town, there are also no [[Raver|night clubs]] or [[Tits|Strip clubs]] in Vancouver. Also, it never snows in Vancouver despite the fact that the town has all the ingredients for snow. It does have the best fireworks show west of the [[Mississippi]] but unless you're into people who hold signs or fireworks, [[shit nobody cares about|you're probably better off avoiding this town.]]

American Vancouver now has [[fail|a new claim to fame.]] On August 30, 2010, a [[batshit insane]] [[Neo-Nazi]] named Bethany Storro [[pwned|self pwned]] herself when she [[Doing It Wrong|splashed acid on her own face and claimed that a negro did it.]] This caused [[attention whore|international media attention.]] It was proven to be a hoax on [http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&hl=en&q=Vancouver%2C+Washington+Acid+Attack+Victim&aq=f&aqi=g4g-o1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=6f32b8af52b7e0b8| September 16, 2010.]
