Have you ever imagined how [[awesome]] it would be to take the stories of [[The Da Vinci Code]], [[Star Wars]], [[Lord of the Rings]], [[The Matrix]], Independence Day, [[Scientology]], [[Raelism]], and the [[Bible|Book of Revelations]] and merge them all into one gigantic super-story? The correct answer is no; you have ''never'' thought that a combination these stories would be awesome, because, well, it wouldn’t be. These stories have absolutely nothing in common, and only a complete moron would even ''think'' that combining these stories would be a good idea. Proof of this statement can be found on XeeATwelve.com.<br />
Similar to [[Truthism.com]] and [[Montalk.net]], Xee-A Twelve is a collection of [[TL;DR]] [[logical fallacy|logical fallacies]] written by a [[batshit insane]] [[Azn|Asian]] [[woman]] from [[Australia]] named Amitakh Stanford. The website is a collection of her memoirs detailing her heroic adventures of fighting aliens and digging up ancient secrets with the help of her [[drugs|divine wisdom]]. To [[mundane|sane]] people, it is the best comedic science-fiction book ever written. To [[David Icke|conspiracy nuts]], it is a sacred work of absolute truth given to us by the "True Light". Similar to how [[Christian]]s worship the [[Bible]], [[Muslim]]s worship the [[Bullshit|Qur'an]], [[Atheist]]s worship [[The God Delusion]], and [[Scientology|Scientologists]] worship [[Dianetics]], [[Truthism|"Truth"ists]] worship the website XeeATwelve.com.

==Summary==

[[Image:Aliens over Dogs.gif|thumb|Aliens hovering over Amitakh's dogs' cages.]]
Before you begin reading this article, here are a few things you should familiarize yourself with, just to make things less confusing.
*The Twelve Universes Are Pentagons.
*Geometry is Satanic.
*[[God]] is a [[woman]].
*The True Light is similar to Heaven, which is where the Divine Mother resides.
*The Anunnaki is a name for the three species of aliens: the Reptilians, the Vulturites, and the Nephilim.
*The New World Order will begin in Australia.
*[[Satan]]'s real name is Darkness, but his favorite name is Jerusalem.
*The Bible Is The Devil's Tool.
*The sun is a cube.
*Inner Earth is real.
*Faires and Pixies are real.
*The Anunnaki have a device called the Atu-waa that can re-start time.
*The Rescue Mission is kind of like [[The Rapture]], where the Divine Mother will rescue all of the True-Light warriors and will leave everyone else to die when the universe collapses.
*Popularity is evil and should be avoided at all costs.
*[[George Washington]], René Descartes, Francis Bacon, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, Aaron Burr, and the [[Pope]] are Reptilians and thus, are agents of Darkness.
*The secret word of the Freemasons is KIR-WHAH-???? (she knows the last syllable, but will not release it because if you say the word, you will be able to harvest the power of Satan) PROTIP: The last syllable is GET.
*If you believe any of this information is [[bullshit]] or [[batshit insane]], you have been programmed by the Anunnaki aliens because they do not want you to know they exist.

Then of course, there's always this:

==Beliefs==
In a nutshell, Xee-A Twelve believes that Inner Earth exists, two races of Anunnaki aliens are at war for total domination of Earth, the sun is a cube, and that Darkness has created this entire universe as a giant illusion, and we are all slaves to his illusion. If you still aren't convinced that the author was either high when she wrote this or is just generally stupid, here is a more in-depth summary of everything Amitakh believes in.

===Geometry===
[[Image:5 satanic solids.JPG|center|The five Satanic solids]]
[[Image:Sun cube.jpg|thumb|THIS IS CUBIC SUN. IT IS MADE OF GEOMETRY AND SATAN.]]
Geometry is evil and the work of [[Satan|Darkness]]. Every single geometric figure is just an illusion created by Satan that forces us to worship him. All geometric figures contain the keys to solving the mysteries of life, which is why Satan made them so confusing.<br />
The Sun is a perfect example of a geometric illusion, because it is not what it appears to be. [[Some argue]] that the Sun is spherical, when in reality, it is actually a cube. The reason it appears to be spherical is because it spins so fast.<br />
Matter is another prime example of a geometric illusion. All particles in the universe have smaller particles within them that are capable of thinking. Spinning triangles and cubes shield the thinking particle from harm or danger. Every particle in the universe is terrified of its death and begs for immortality.<br />
Of course, if the entire universe is made up of these spinning, three dimensional figures, then that makes this entire thing not just a shitty science fiction/fantasy story, but a [[Dungeons & Dragons|shitty science fiction/fantasy game]]. And really, if Satan plays [[D&D]], just how [[Neckbeard|fearsome and powerful can he actually be?]]

===Aliens===
There are two races of Anunnaki aliens fighting for control of Earth: The [[Reptilians]] and the Vulturites. The Reptilians are the ones in control now, but the Vulturites are trying to fuck the Reptilians over so ''they'' can have control over Earth and all of humanity. The Vulturites want to fuck with the religions and sciences invented by the Reptilians so that people will start becoming more and more separated. In short, anything that is popular and brings people closer together is probably the work of the Reptilians, while anything that is popular and splits us farther apart is probably the work of the Vulturites. Anything that isn't popular is not evil and has been given to us by [[God]], and therefore, popularity should be avoided at all costs (which shouldn't be too difficult for [[you]]).<br />
Although the battle for world domination is primarily between the Vulturites and the Reptilians, there are several other aliens that are being used as pawns in this battle for Armaggedeon. The most notable of the non-notables are the Greys, an ancient race that has been working with the Reptilians to steal human DNA. The Reptilians have promised the Greys that if they help them bring about the NWO, they'll give the Greys a shitload of human DNA, which they can mix with their own DNA to create a hybrid race of super-beings that will emerge as the dominant species of Earth after the Reptilians kill off all the humans. However, the Reptilians [[pwned|lied]] to the Greys; they won't really be giving them human DNA.

===[[The Rapture|Rescue Mission]]===
Since Satan is evil and trying to extinguish the True Light, the [[God|Divine Mother]] has started a Rescue Mission to bring all of her True Light warriors back home. There are three types of souls on the planet: True Light souls, False Light souls, and artificial souls. True Light souls are good and can be rescued from Satan and the aliens by the Divine Mother. False Light souls are evil, but have True Light particles in them. If the True Light particles can be separated from the False Light particles, the person can be rescued. Artificial souls are pure evil and were invented by either Satan or Anunnaki scientists.<br />
Here's how shit works: Satan is kidnapping viable True-Light workers and imprisoning them in his Virtual Reality. The Divine Mother doesn't like this, so she sent a bunch of "walk-ins" to Earth to rescue the True-Light workers that were trapped here. However, the True Light workers can only be rescued if they hold on to their Will and do not give in to Darkness. If they give their Will to Darkness, they are spiritually assassinated and become a slave to him.<br />
After the [[Christ]] Energy and the [[Antichrist|Anti-Christ]] Energy fight, the Rescue Mission will be complete and all of the True Light workers will be saved, leaving the Anunnaki to commence their New World Order and enslave humanity. After a few thousand years, Satan will die, the Universal Dodecahedron will collapse, and everything's hunky dory.

==Notable articles==
Xee-A Twelve consists of 131 articles. Most of these articles revolve around [[Satan]] and the Divine Mother. Since all of these articles are far too long and boring to read, we at ED have taken the liberty of reading a select few and writing short summaries on each one.

===Nibiru and the Anunnaki===
[[Some argue|Arguably]] one of the most famous articles, Nibiru and the Anunnaki is Amitakh's version of the planet Nibiru story and the explanation of where our alien overlords came from. A long time ago, the Anunnaki leaders, known as the Nephilim, created two different sects of aliens via genetic experiments. The first aliens, known as the [[Reptoids|Ducaz]], were used to conquer and control the Nibirian empire. The second group, known by the aliens as the Pers-sires and by Amitakh as the Vulturites, are bitter enemies of each other.
Here's how shit went down: The Anunnaki Elite created a bunch of slave aliens to Earth, and thus the advanced city of Atlantis was born. They killed all of the Neaderthal species and created the homo sapiens through a second wave of genetic experiments. They also emplyed a bunch of other aliens to be their slaves on Earth, along with their human slaves. The Anunnaki Elite eventually got bored controlling Earth so they just nuked Atlantis, hoping to wipe out all of the human and alien slaves. However, some of the Anunnaki slaves figured out this evil plan and escaped before they blew the city up. The Anunnaki Remnants brought with them some of the artifacts of Atlantis, and they're hoping when the Anunnaki Elite return, they'll be pleased with what they've done. However, the Elite won't be returning any time soon since the [[police|Attas of the Light]] have scared the [[niggers|Anunnaki Elite]] into permanent hiding.

===The Secret Anunnaki ''Atu-waa''===
So, essentially, the Anunnaki have a device called the Atu-waa which has the ability to re-start time in our solar system. It was meant to be activiated before 2008, but they couldn't do it because our hero Amitakh stole one of the pieces herself and thus, made the device useless. However, after the Reptilians and the Vulturites started their drama war, the Reptilians hid the device somewhere in the [[Middle East]]. Amitakh also knows every single location it has ever been and discloses each of them on a public website where the evil aliens could find the device easily.

<big><span class="co;[Collapse Quotes];[Quotes from this Article];0;tsaaw"></span></big>

<span class="tsaaw"> {{squote|The Anunnaki Elite realized that their planet and star were in a precarious situation long before they were destroyed. Therefore, they re-located the time re-starting device (called atu-waa) to a very remote planet that had virtually no technology. That remote planet was Earth.|Amitakh Stanford}} </span>

<span class="tsaaw"> {{squote|The Jews claim to be the chosen race of Jehovah, but what have they been chosen for?

<span class="tsaaw"> {{squote|When they invaded Iraq in 2003, the Vulturites were after the lost word of the Freemasons, the atu-waa, and the "power point" from where the atu-waa could be activated. They were not looking for weapons of mass destruction at all.|Amitakh Stanford}} </span>

<span class="tsaaw"> {{squote|To digress here, when Hitler was running amok in Europe, the ruling elite were relatively unconcerned until he turned his attention to the Middle East, at which point, Generals Patton and Montgomery were unleashed with such a fury that the allies suddenly gained full control of the situation.

<span class="tsaaw"> {{squote|The Reptilians have moved the atu-waa around the world. It has been to many places in recent years, all of which were under Reptilian control at the time.

<span class="tsaaw"> {{squote|The Vulturites are unaware that the atu-waa is non-functional at this time. The Reptilians have kept this information from the Vulturites and everyone else.

This is the part that I confiscated from the Reptilians a long time ago, after the last re-start of time. This is what Ata-i-lek is so furious about and is trying to dislodge from me by any means, including flattery, cajoling, threats, force and deception. It is a catch-22 situation for the Reptilians. That is why I am still here.|Amitakh Stanford|our hero strikes again!}} </span>

===The Real Secret Word of the Freemasons===
Amitakh begins by talking about the history of the Freemasons, where there were three syllables to a secret Word that would allow the one to utter it to control the world and bring the Anunnaki Elite back to Earth. King Solomon and King Hiram knew the first two (which she exposes are are "KIR" and "WHAH"), and Abiff's syllable (the third and most important) was lost forever. Later, Amitakh continues to demonstrate her [[schizophrenia|psychic abilities]] by exclaming that she knows all three syllables(the first two that she would have to be a 33rd degree Freemason to know, the last one that nobody knows which obviously makes her [[insane|psychic]]), but she says she will not disclose the last syllable or [[guessing|how she got it]] because of how dangerous it is.<br />
Our hero then proceeds to talk about how [[Christianity]] and [[Freemasons|Freemasonry]] are [[Satanism|Satanic]] and how they are based off the [[Pagan]] worship of the [[Sun]].

<big><span class="co;[Collapse Quotes];[Quotes from this Article];0;trswotf"></span></big>

<span class="trswotf"> {{squote|I know Solomon's and Hiram's sounds or syllables.  I also know Abiff's sound.  I know the entire lost Word.  How I know this is irrelevant.  Equally, whether anyone believes my assertion or not, is irrelevant.  Even when I first mentally reviewed this sound I could feel the tremendous Dark power of the Word.  I also have the counter-sound which I used to neutralize the Dark Word.  Now, the complete, dreadful Dark secret Word that Freemasons seek to assemble has been contained and neutralized.|Amitakh Stanford|you know she's got the lost sound because she felt its evil powers, and she neutralized it, but she's not telling how she got it}} </span>

<span class="trswotf"> {{squote|I now disclose the two sounds. King Solomon's syllable is "KIR" and King Hiram's syllable is "WHAH".  Abiff's syllable has eluded those of Darkness for 3,000 years, and they will not acquire it before this virtual reality collapses.|Amitakh Stanford|she's already given the first two syllables which would make it easier for anyone to figure out, but since she's a prophet and she said they won't find it before the universe collapses, there's nothing to worry about}} </span>

<span class="trswotf"> {{squote|One strong indication of the breaking of the illusion of the virtual reality occurred recently.  A dog enclosure was locked and the lock had frozen shut.  I needed to enter, but couldn't because of the frozen lock. I then pulled on the lock several times, but was unable to unfreeze it.  Then, I pulled again and amazingly was able to pass the frozen-shut metal lock and my hand through a two-layered galvanized steel latch!  I actually passed both my hand and the metal lock right through the steel hasp!  To do this defies the laws of physics in this realm, yet it occurred.  It was the equivalent of walking through a wall while carrying a metal object with me.|Amitakh Stanford}} </span>

<span class="trswotf"> {{squote|While electrons are trapped by protons and neutrons on the atomic level, planets are trapped by stars or suns on the macro level. The sun of our solar system is the trap. It gives off False-Light, which the planets need to survive in this material realm.  In exchange for this light, the sun forces the planets to revolve around it and to do all the work keeping the solar system bound together in the illusion which is driven by their orbits around the sun.  If the perpetual motion of the planets — the merry-go-round — stops, the illusion crumbles, and all the viable True-Light beings in the entire solar system are liberated from the entrapments of Darkness.|Amitakh Stanford|FUCKING SUN WE SEE YOU'RE EVIL PLAN TO DOMINATE AND ENSLAVE THE PLANETS OF THE UNIVERSE BY FORCING THEM TO "REVOLVE" AROUND YOU}} </span>

<span class="trswotf"> {{squote|Much has been said of late about the sun cruisers that have been photographed near the sun. A great deal of speculation has occurred as to what they are doing. They are crafts of the True Divine Creation which are here to extinguish the sun.|Amitakh Stanford|ARE YOU READY TO BE FREED FROM THE FUCKING SUN?}} </span>

===The Twelve Universes Are Pentagons===
[[Image:UniversalDodecahedron.jpg|thumb|The Universal Dodecahedron]]
[[Image:Itsinnerearth.gif|thumb|Inner Earth]]
According to Xee-A Twelve, everything in the universe is an illusion. Motion is an illusion, shapes are an illusion, time is an illusion, and [[you]] are an illusion.<br />
As said by Amitakh Stanford, the five symmetrical solids are the Tetrahedron (aka the Pyramid), the Hexahedron (aka the Cube), the Octahedron, the Dodecahedron, and the Icosahedron. The sixth symmetrical solid is the sphere, the most evil and diabolical of the group. This is because spheres are the shape you get when you spin the other five really, really fast. Therefore, Amitakh Stanford has concluded that the Sun, and all other stars for that matter, are cubes, but they are spinning so fast that you can’t tell. As said by [[Truthism.com]], Satan did this because [[LOL WUT|90-degree right-angles create strife and confusion.]]<br />
Another thing that is not what it appears to be is Matter. Matter are actually ultra-microscopic particles capable of thinking for themselves. These particles lie at the core of an atom, and are protected by more spinning shapes. The three layers of shields are called the ''alat'', the ''lakoo'', and the ''sakooze''. Of course, these aren’t the official names, they’re just names she pulled out of her ass. <br />
After it discusses particle shields, it starts getting off-topic and talking about a Rescue Mission to bring people who work for [[Heaven|the True Light]] back home to the Divine Mother . The reason this rescue mission was inspired is because Satan is kidnapping True Light warriors and putting them in [[Earth|his prison for slavery and mind control]].

<big><span class="co;[Collapse Quotes];[Quotes from this Article];0;ttuap"></span></big>

<span class="ttuap"> {{squote|Many believe that Pythagoras, Plato and Kepler interpreted the five symmetrical solids in esoteric ways only. This is not so. All three understood that the five solids literally contained the keys to understanding the mysteries of life.|Amitakh Stanford }}</span>

<span class="ttuap">{{squote|Plato was able to perceive that triangles were building blocks of existence. Plato was probably able to "see" at the atomic level, which level, as I will explain herein, is based upon tetrahedrons and octahedrons.

===On The Brink Of The Anunnaki New World Order===
The most infamous article on the website as well as the one that makes conspiracy theorists cum buckets, ''On The Brink Of The Anunnaki New World Order'' regards the inevitable [[Catnarok|apocalyptic alien war]] that will soon DESTROY US ALL!!!<br />
This article starts out by explaining why the evil space lizards have not yet annihilated us with their technology. The answer is simple: [[LOL WUT|they think humans are physically attractive and therefore want to mate with us]]. This explains why women want to get breast implants and larger asses, and why men want to be buff; because they are being programmed by the Anunnaki aliens.<br />
After it's done explaining how aliens have been [[rape|raping]] humans, it starts talking about other ways society is falling apart. For example, people are [[anarchy|breaking the rules]] a lot more, so more laws have to be introduced. They were originally going to start the New World Order in [[America]], but then they got lazy and decided to move it to [[Australia]] instead. Police officers are being programmed to believe that laws make everyone safer, and military personnel are being programmed to kill anyone who interferes with their perfect world.

<span class="tanwo">[[Image:Buyadog.jpg|thumb|[[Buy a Dog|Buying a dog]] will not only stop Anonymous, it will also stop Anunnaki aliens]]</span>

<span class="tanwo">{{squote|There are many reasons why the Anunnaki remained hidden from human eyes on the planet all this time, and why they have not used their technology to annihilate the whole human race. One of the reasons is that most of the races of Anunnaki are [[ugly|not particularly attractive in physical terms]]. When they arrived on Earth, they were taken in by the human form and admired its appearance. This led to many aliens mating with human women, either [[rape|forcibly]] or [[rape|voluntarily]]. Many of the Anunnaki have strong sex drives, and the fact that humans can mate whether in or out of season was a bonus for the aliens on Earth.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

<span class="tanwo"> {{squote|Anunnaki are particularly attracted to large breasts, hence they have urged and otherwise programmed women to pursue breast implants.

<span class="tanwo">{{squote|Wherever there is pressure to fluoridate water systems, there is a very good chance that Greys are about to re-locate to the area. As I have indicated, for the time being, Greys are closely aligned with the Reptilians.

The Greys have conducted horrible experiments on humans to work with both sets of DNA. However, [[YHBT|the Reptilians have lied to the Greys]]; their DNA will not be used for any new emergent species.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

<span class="tanwo">{{squote|Some of the latest examples of Vulturite propaganda involve [[Dan Brown|The Da Vinci Code]] and the "discovery" of the Book of Judas. These are both designed to destabilize the Reptilian religious foundations.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

===Prison Break - The Annihilation Of Death And Darkness===
Another of the more infamous articles on Xee-A Twelve, this article discusses Death and the Rescue Mission inspired by the True Light. It starts out asking the question of "Why must things die?". It then asks why we are so afraid of Death, followed by the simple answer that it's because Satan programmed us to be afraid of death. [[Irony|Ironically]], Satan is so afraid of his own death that he made us be scared of it too, and therefore, in order to be like your Heavenly Mother, you cannot be afraid of Death, because nothing actually has "survival instincts", but instead, just Satan's fear of death that has been programmed into us.<br />
After this, it begins discussing how Reincarnation and Matter, and motion are evil and Satanic. Because everything in Satan's Virtual Reality is a slave to motion, when something stops being in motion, it dies. The illusion of no-motion is what keeps the illusion of motion going, and once the illusion that nothing is moving stops, everything really will stop moving and the universe will be destroyed.

<span class="taodad">{{squote|Darkness is so frightened of Its own demise that even the smallest building blocks of the physical universes (Matter) are thoroughly saturated with the instinctive fear of death. The fear of death is a morbid disease. It was created by a putrid, demented Mind. It is this fear that will eventually topple the entire physical universe.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

<span class="taodad">{{squote|Ironically, death is the very tool Darkness invented and imposed on everything in Its domain - the Virtual Reality - to control and enslave Its creation and all that are trapped in it.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

<span class="taodad">{{squote|Everything in this Virtual Reality requires a consciousness - whether a True or an artificial consciousness - to drive it. This means that even a grain of sand has a consciousness. Even things much smaller than grains of sand have consciousnesses.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

<span class="taodad">{{squote|Re-incarnation is really a very evil imposition on the consciousness. It is done under the false pretence that the process of death and rebirth is in the best interests of the consciousness for its own purification and advancement.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

<span class="taodad">{{squote|However, the physical bodies housing all categories of all consciousness are made up of Matter (Evil) and are influenced by the programming embedded in them.|Amitakh Stanford|Matter is evil; avoid it at all costs}}</span>

<span class="taodad">{{squote|"Assassination" occurs at the moment a True Light being gives over its Will to Darkness. This can be done by trickery, deception, temptation, bribery, punishment, torture or other means. Those who give over their Will are then "fallen" beings, and, for all intents and purposes, are beings of Darkness. 
It should be understood that Darkness has not the power to take any True Light being's Will by force. The Will can only be given over to Darkness by the True Light being.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

===Separation of Light From Darkness Has Finally Begun===
Amitakh begins by pointing out the [[obvious|imperceptible]] truth that the world has turned to shit. She then begins talking about how the [[New-Age]] Movement is full of inexperienced gurus with no scientific, academic, philosophical, or theological background. Of course, Amitakh is in no way trying to start her own New-Age cult and accusing her of this would be ludicrous.<br />
This article then begins pointing out how [[truth]] is so easily corrupted - when a message of True Light enters into the Virtual Reality, it is [[rape|pounced upon]] by workers of Darkness, who begin corrupting the True-Light's message as soon as it enters. Of course, the information on XeeATwelve.com has not yet been corrupted because, well, it is made of brainwash and lies.<br />
After this, talks about stupid shit like how Darkness is the evil mastermind behind the New Age movement, and all of the New Age gurus are actually working for him. Then it goes into the Rescue Mission again and how the Christ Energy will soon intertwine with the Anti-Christ Energy, and how cataclysmic the battle will be.

<big><span class="co;[Collapse Quotes];[Quotes from this Article];0;solfd"></span></big>

<span class="solfd">{{squote|Once genuine material filters through the evil system, it is immediately pounced upon by the “natural laws” in place in the realm. That is, the agents of Darkness in all forms begin corrupting the truth. This corrupting process is ever so subtle, gradual and deceptive that it appears natural, thus keeping people unaware of the process and the unseen intention behind it.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

<span class="solfd">{{squote|Among these sites are many that are operated by people who serve the ruling elite. Many of these websites are assisted by the ruling elite, which have control of the internet. The ruling elites’ agents decide which websites are blocked and which are promoted. Website hit counters, availability, speed, convenience and access are all controlled and manipulated by the ruling elite. Search engines will often place the ruling elites’ chosen sites at or near the top of many searches. However, there are times when it suits the ruling elite to put valid websites at or near the top of searches to satisfy their own ulterior motives.|Amitakh Stanford|Aliens are [[The Great eBarrier Reef|censoring the internet]] (which is probably why they moved to Australia)}}</span>

<span class="solfd">{{squote|The ruling elite have many ways of obtaining recruits to act as their agents. Beside the main group that openly serves the ruling elite, others are blackmailed, some are bribed and still others are coerced into service. The [[New Age]] movement, commerce, banking, [[politics]], conventional [[religion]]s and so on are infested with agents of the ruling elite.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

<span class="solfd">{{squote|What people are unaware of is that the purpose of existence in the Virtual Reality is to serve Darkness. Darkness enslaved every being in the Virtual Reality and forces them to serve It. All of the trapped True-Light beings in the Virtual Reality are assisted by the Light to awaken to the degree necessary to sustain them until they can be rescued. Many people may think that the solution to the Virtual Reality is to make Darkness burn in hell. But, hell is Darkness’ creation – Its home. Darkness runs hell, which is a reality within the Virtual Reality. To let Darkness burn in hell would be to let Darkness have Its own way and to keep It going.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

===It Is Done, It Is Finished===
[[Image:Amitakhandchiappalone.jpg|thumb|Amitakh Stanford and her alien husband, [[Hitler|Joseph Chiappalone]].]]
The grand finale of the Xee-A Twelve website this article almost resembles a soap opera with a science-fiction twist to it. Amitakh finally comes out and reveals that she is, in fact, an alien. Her mission here on Earth has been to keep an eye on an evil alien being known as Ikluk, so in order to do this, she had to marry him. He beat her up regularly for writing stupid shit on the Internet and not just shutting the fuck up and making him dinner like she was supposed to, but she still wasn't getting the message. She watched Ikluk (or his name on Earth, Joseph Chiappalone) abuse people who disagreed with him, but she couldn't interfere because the Light told her not to. She then concludes by telling all of the True-Light Workers not to give in to Darkness and to remain faithful to the Heavenly Mother.

<span class="iidiif">{{squote|I am an extraterrestrial being – code name – Amitakh. I came to the Earth as a “walk-in”. One of my main responsibilities has been to keep close tabs on an evil alien being – code name – Ikluk.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

<span class="iidiif">{{squote|He [Ikluk] has taken on many identities, such as: Aaron (brother/cousin of Moses), John the Baptist, Kirok, King Arthur, Hitler and, in his current "incarnation", he has taken on a relatively insignificant body as a small-town medical doctor known as Joseph Chiappalone.|Amitakh Stanford|OH SHIT HITLER'S BACK, AND HE'S WORKING AS A MEDICAL DOCTOR IN AUSTRALIA}}</span>

<span class="iidiif">{{squote|During my marriage to Ikluk, I was subjected to his physical, mental, emotional and spiritual abuse. He humiliated me and put me down. He also beat me up regularly. During one of the beatings, he punched me so many times that I fell to the ground. Then he pulled me up by my hair, dragged me by my hair for about 30 metres and threw me through the front door of the house. He then banged my head against the wall several times, shouting abuse at me. I lost consciousness and was hospitalized from the beating.|Amitakh Stanford}}</span>

{{morphquote|xeeaquotes|background-color:#ffffff;|font-weight: bold;
|Fairyland, where pixies, gnomes, leprechauns, fairies and others of the like dwell is a "magical" place where things are simply magical and where time passes at a different pace than the human physical realm. The inhabitants of Fairyland can manifest as whirlwinds, dust storms, rainstorms, or breezes, etc. when they visit the human realm.|Amitakh Stanford, [http://xeeatwelve.com/articles/fairies.html wait...wat?]
|It is now time to announce that White Buffalo Woman has returned and that her work is nearly completed. White Buffalo Woman has returned to Earth, not to teach, but to liberate viable True-Light beings who have been trapped in the Shadows.|Amitakh Stanford, [http://www.xeeatwelve.com/articles/Announcing_WBW.html White Buffalo Woman is coming]
|Once again, the "Flying White Buffaloes" will gather. The time is now.|Amitakh Stanford, Flying White Buffalos are coming!
|As many are now aware, the Four Elements were symbolically released from the Shadows in September 2004. In October 2005, the Numbers were symbolically released from the grasp of the Shadows. Sadly, for a long, long time, certain of the True Creator's children were forced to perform the functions of Numbers.|Amitakh Stanford
|The first Number to be spontaneously released was Number Four, which took far longer to release than all the other Numbers combined. This was no surprise since Number Four has been the most abused by the Shadows. Number Four is the model used by the Shadows in many of Its "prisons". There was a huge release from Number Four, because, apart from many others reasons, Four carries with it all the burdens and tears of One to Three. Thus, Number Four had to be released first.|Amitakh Stanford|The liberation of Numbers was a long awaited, joyous occasion, attended by benevolent beings from all levels.|Amitakh Stanford, [http://xeeatwelve.com/articles/liberation_numbers.html The Numbers are finally free from the shadows]}}

==Who is Amitakh?==
[[File:Amitakh dogs.jpg|thumb|Amitakh and some of her animal [[dogs|family]] [http://xeeatwelve.com/articles/AHP.html].]]
No matter how hard you search, it's difficult to find information about Amitakh. Many evil, Satanic Reptilians have tried exposing her as a cult leader and an Illuminati [[PsyOp|Psyop]]. Many claim her and her evil alien husband [[Hitler|Joseph Chiappalone]] are still together and working to destroy the universe.

{{morphquote|mqtest3|background-color:#ffffff;|font-weight: bold;
|If Amitakh and Dr. Chippalone have their way you will all be destroyed, along with the Earth and the Physical universe as a whole! We have a theme going here, yes?|Channelz, ''[http://educate-yourself.org/cn/authorexposesamitakhandjosephchiappalone27mar04.shtml Source]''
|Amitakh says that '''George Washington''', John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, John Marshall (and others) were '''Reptilian agents''' who were working to undermine the new American republic and '''to assist the British to re-assimilate the colonies'''. I could maybe go along with Hamilton as an Illuminati agent, but George Washington?|Ken Adachi, ''[http://educate-yourself.org/cn/concerensaboutamitakhsanford12jul06.shtml Source]''
|On the other hand, '''Benjamin Franklin''' and Thomas Jefferson are painted by Amitakh as leading members of the "Light" (called "Attas") who were on a "rescue" mission at the constitutional conventional and essentially saved the day. Is this the ''same'' Benjamin Franklin who was a member of the British '''Lunar Society''', '''The Hells Fire Club''', and numerous other British (Illuminati/satanic) secret societies? Is this the ''same'' Benjamin Franklin whose floor beneath his London house was excavated some years ago and the bones of some 18 young children were discovered?|Ken Adachi, ''[http://educate-yourself.org/cn/concerensaboutamitakhsanford12jul06.shtml Source]''
|Amitakh and her ex-husband, Joseph Chiappalone, used to operate a proper cult here in Australia. They were being monitored very closely by the authorities. One day, Joseph was CONVICTED of the serious assault of two cult members.|[http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message346756/pg1 Source]
|Amitakh and Joseph Chiappalone set up The Centre of Knowledge cult in Australia in 1985. The cult was kept under close scrutiny by the authorities due to five cult members meeting untimely deaths, as well as other suspicious activites. Joseph Chiappalone was convicted of the brutal gang-bashing of two cult members in the late 1980's. Amitakh is not a doctor. Her educational qualifications are mostly a pretense. Amitakh's current husband, Steffan Stanford claims to be an Attorney - however he is nothing of the sort. The Chiappalones/Stanfords are liars. Members of their cyber cult are brainwashed, delusional, and dangerous. It is pointless, and even risky, to argue with them. They are incapable of rational discussion.|[http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message346756/pg2 Source]}}

===Amitakh Stanford / Amitakh Chiappalone===
Since Amitakh's alien husband Joseph Chiappalone has a cult of his own called '''ANNWN''' and still claims to be married to Amitakh, it has been rumored that Amitakh Stanford and Amitakh Chiappalone are different people. However, other paranoid conspiracy theorists such as Ken Adachi think that Amitakh Stanford is a [[sockpuppet]] used by Amitakh Chiappalone and that the two are now divorced.

{{quote|There is little doubt that the author of these works are the same person. Amitakh Stanford, D.M. and Amitakh Chiappalone are the same person. Why then why is Dr. Chippalone alleging she is his wife if she is married to Steffan Stanford? Perhaps Dr. C & She are now divorced? Perhaps Amitakh Stanford is the same person as Amitakh Chiappalone, and she wishes for this little fact to remain unknown, to remain anonymous. I would too if I put out the kind of rubbish that flows forth from these sources. An example of what I mean is that the essays and material reveal the thoughts of a megalomaniac. This kind of thinking is present in the works of Dr. Chiappalone and and Amitakh Chippalone.|Ken Adachi|[http://educate-yourself.org/cn/authorexposesamitakhandjosephchiappalone27mar04.shtml Source]}}

==Fanbase==
Amitakh's fanbase usually consists of all sorts of people who share the common trait of batfuck insanity, paranoid schizohrenia, and the antisocial personality disorder. They have trouble accepting that perhaps they're just losers, so they resort to Amitakh's writings as an alternative, which state that if they believe everything she writes, they're special and [[The Rapture|their souls will be saved in the Rescue Mission]]. Needless to say, these morons are easy to troll.
{{morphquote|mqtest2|background-color:#ffffff; width: 700px; height: 210px;|font-weight: bold;
|You call Amitakh a cult leader, and myself and others the member of a cult, when in reality, there is NO "cult" in existence. You even ridiculously compare Amitakh's work to Jim Jones' and allude to "kool-aid" mass suicide, when in reality, there is not even a "cult," in existences, and Amitakh has said multiple times that, "i do not advocate suicide."|DerekOneSeven, ''[http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message346756/pg1 in denial]''
|And yes, our cult *is* growing, so deal with it. However, we are not New Age. Such an accusation is simply your wishful thinking.|troydungeon, ''[http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message346756/pg1 also in denial]''
|As for 20-40, [[what|who is a pervert]], and has admitted CIA connections, it is obvious to anyone who's heart is aligned with Goodness and Light, that his energy vile, and that he hatefully spews deceitful venom, and hypocritically condemns those who are innocent.|DerekOneSeven, ''[http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message346756/pg1 if you think our cult is insane, you are a perverted alien]''}}
