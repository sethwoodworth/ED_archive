The '''Nintendo DS''' ('''Nintendo Dick Sucker''' or '''Dip Shit''') is a portable game device that was dumped all over the market in fall 2004. Despite Nintendo having passed up the chance to have given it a better name, such as PNES (Portable Nintendo Entertainment System or Penis), it has totally sucked ass compared to Sony's [[PSP]] (not that it matters though cause the PSP is still a fucking piece of shit), becoming a flaw point for Nintendo [[fanboys]] in basements around the world.

== Multiple ways to play ==
The standard Nintendo DS comes with two screens, a touch screen, a microphone, a rechargeable battery, and a pruning attachment.  These components are used to deflect the player's attention from the horrible graphics.  

[[Image:Dspc.jpg|thumb|Previous dual-screen solutions were cumbersome at best]]

=== Dual screens ===
Programmers have long impoverished gamers with their devil-may-care imposition of maps and status bars directly upon the player's field of vision. With an unheard-of "doubling" of available play space, DS provides ample room for the display of both in-game action as well as vital information such as "Hi-Score" and "Number of keys left".

=== Touch screen ===
Who doesn't like to [[pervert|touch]] things? Any number of physical objects can be <s>stimulated</s> simulated upon this versatile liquid crystal display. Use either your stylus or your oily fingertips to rub, massage, cajole, jiggle, titillate, bobble, or [[rape|insert]]. The game is truly in your hands. Sadly, most games force the touch screen feature to be used in pointless, pointless ways to justify installing it. 

=== Classic controls ===
[[Image:Pictochat.jpg|thumb|[[At least 100]] feet.]]
Nintendo DS also features a "classic," [[Super Nintendo]]-style control layout, though none of the buttons are actually connected to anything. This hasn't stopped game designers from using the buttons, however, making half the DS library completely unplayable.

=== Pictochat === 
[[Image:Pictochat_titties.gif|thumb|Pictochat for [[sick fucks]]]]
[[Image:Dskids.jpg|thumb|DS brings gamers together]]
[[Pedophile|Pedophiliacs]] can now get in on the game with DS's built-in chat feature Pictochat. By moving within a <s>65</s> <s>90</s> <s>120</s> <s>200</s> <s>250</s> <s>300</s> over 9,000-foot radius of any schoolyard, municipal park, or playground, [[Pedobear|strangers]] can use their DS to [http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=special_coverage&id=3905371 lure unsuspecting children] to dangerous and uncompromised locations.

Not content to rest on its laurels, Nintendo has also [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4353480.stm signed an agreement] with Wayport, Inc., establishing wireless DS access points in [[McDonald's]] restaurants across the United States. This streamlines the process by allowing pedophiles to simply take their DS to the parking lot of any McDonald's with a PlayPlace.

In other news, third parties are also working on a police scanner peripheral to be placed in the GBA slot. It will help protect the constitutional rights of gamers who make use of the Pictochat software. 

Those facts, of course, have promptly attained [[Fox News]]' attention, who proceeded to create their usual [[lollercaust]] out of it. Here is the whole [[Shit|investigative report]]:

According to sources, the new ''Pantu'' game, as forewarned on Brass Eye, [[WTF|will let PEDOPHILES WATCH YOUR CHILDREN through the screen]], the pedophiles will also be able to release pheromones through your child's DS to make them moar susceptible to being molested. The parents can test this, by sniffing the screens, and if they are DS molested by a drooling, fishy smelling, 56 year old man, through the screen, then the parents know not to let their children near it.....unless they've broken a vase, in which case, parents may use DS rape as form of punishment

=== Nintendo DSi ===

In 2008, Nintendo at the Nintendo Conference in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] announced that they we're turning the Nintendo DS into a mobile phone, except you cannot use it to call your [[wiggers|friends]] or family, and pretty much the only thing you can do with it is connect to the internet to buy approved Nintendo products and take pictures of said friends & family.

It also takes out the [[GBA]] slot and replaces it with a SD Card slot, [[gay|completely ruining]] functionality for the [[Pokemon|games that actually used it]], or removes atleast some functionality for it, [[no|is it feeling 100% perfect yet?]] It also contains flash memory, so you can store [[porn|things]] on your DS. you could watch porn on it, just no porn videos which pretty much takes away the functionality of having fucking internet on the sonnofabitch. The DSi also has updates, so Homebrew developers can dangle useful Homebrew in your face and then you can be disappointed when Nintendo takes it away from you. [[no|So should you throw away your old DS?]]  Besides if you wanted to make cheap porn, can't you just buy a camera. Just like the [[Wii]] it also has a shop feature so you can buy [[crap|games]]. But most of the games are crappy puzzle games or really fucking dumb!

Atleast you are able to help Nintendo sell out.

'''Protip''': Find $25 and buy a Gameboy Advance SP from [http://www.amazon.com/ Ebay] instead.

== [[Graphics]] ==
{{Quote|It has lots of graphics.|[[Nintendo]] [[fanboy]] black person|color=black|size=540%}}

DS graphics technology is completely [[teh]] [[suck]]. The best looking game, ''Super [[Mario]]'', was released at launch, and the graphics actually seem to be getting worse with time. It is estimated that by the end of the system's life, the average DS game will look worse than ''[[Pac-Man]]''. 

=== 3D Graphics ===
[[Image:Ds3d.jpg|thumb|Forget everything you think you knew about graphics]]
Combining the woefully underpowered processing of Game Boy Advance with the decade-old technology found in the [[Shit nobody cares about |GamePark 32]], Nintendo DS consistently challenges our conception of how awful three-dimensional graphics can be.  According to first-hand accounts, its futile cobbling of bland polygonal forms into some approximation of visual coherency is an experience best characterized as disturbing.

=== 2D Graphics ===
Because of its limited 3D capabilities, DS has actually prompted what is considered to be a "renaissance" in 2D gaming. Be wary of this. If 2D gaming does not interest you, always study the back of a game's box closely and confirm that you are only buying games with good 3D graphics, not because it'll help, but maybe someone will see you looking and tell you how choppy the graphics are. It'd be a better idea altogether to just become An Hero.

== Design ==
[[Image:Dsteeth.jpg|thumb|Share it with someone you love]]

=== Clamshell ===
The DS sports a patented clamshell design, along with native IEEE 802.11 wireless support and multiple rows of spring-loaded, interlocking teeth.  

Players can invite friends and family to join in on the fun by handing them their DS and then "activating" it from a variety of wirelessly-enabled devices.

=== Stylus ===
The standard Nintendo DS stylus is specially designed to dig into the side of your finger and cause infection. And though critics have described it as too tiny and uncomfortable for practical use, it should be said that the stylus is also easily lost, and will inevitably require the player to purchase another, better stylus.

In the interests of dimwitted consumerism, various "special-edition" styli have also been released, introducing several other annoyances, such as a douche on a go kart and somebody's disembodied hand.

== DS Meme ==
[[Image:FGSFDS.png|thumb|'''For god sakes, fuck DS!''']]
The [[meme]], [[fgsfds]] matches perfectly to the Nintendo DS.

== Fanboyism ==
[[Image:Dsfanboy.jpg|thumb|left|Nintendo fanboyism is making significant gains.]]
Before the release of the DS, Nintendo [[fanboy|fanboyism]] had been a lost cause. With [[PSP]] poised to end Nintendo's dominance of the portable market, Sony and Microsoft [[fanboys]] were drooling in anticipation of Nintendo's impending demise.

But despite its terrible graphics, bulky design, and peculiar, garlicky odor, the DS has prevailed, becoming the world's most popular video game system among females age 50-79. This course of events has effected a basic shift in the power structure of fanboyism worldwide.

Nintendo fanboys, once minimalized and ridiculed by dueling Sony and Microsoft fanboys, have subsequently experienced an unprecedented resurgence in credibility and influence. Going further, the success of DS has redefined the very notion of intermingling fanaticisms, laying the groundwork for proposed fanboy alliances such as "PSWii" and "[[Wii60]]".

== Nintendo 3DS ==
The Nintendo DS was criticized for being an underpowered, gimmicky abortion of a game console, which would be entirely unable to compete with the [[PSP]]- <s>if the PSP actually had a decent game available.</s> HOLY FUCK THE PSP HAS GAMES? In response, when creating the 3DS, Nintendo decided to keep the dual screens, microphone, and touch screen, as well as adding 3D viewing to the top screen, a music player, fucking THREE cameras, an analog nub similar to the much-hated nub on the PSP, 12 new buttons, a bottle opener, and an assortment of seemingly useless connectors that will be used in the future when Nintendo rolls out their line of home appliances and continues forcing dimwitted "educational" titles onto the market. Yes, [[Your Mom]] is going to buy one.

=== [[NeoGAF]] Forums ===
[[Image:Prints_money.gif|thumb|When [[old meme]] meets [[Nintendo]].]]
The most important hub of [[gaming]] [[fanboy|fanboyism]] on the [[internets]], the [http://www.neogaf.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=2 NeoGAF Forums] are a nauseating potpourri of hype, unsubstantiated claims, and pathetic dick-measuring. Recognized and frequented by a host of gaming "professionals" and "media," it is the foremost authority as to which silly game-related [[memes]] will be parceled out for acceptance amidst the mainstream internet community.

Though formerly an endangered species on these forums, the Nintendo fanboy has parlayed the DS phenomenon into an inalienable siege upon the limited mindshare of both NeoGAF posters and moderators. At the center of their cachet is the weekly thread of Japanese hardware and software statistics, which starkly enumerates the DS's unprecedented domination of the Japanese gaming market. An empirically-supported circle jerk of all things Nintendo, these threads are a weekly platform upon which fanboys claim personal achievement and credibility through giddy admiration of their favorite video game company.  

Furthermore, these threads are an absolute minefield for anyone not hopelessly enamored with Nintendo, as the mere suggestion that DS isn't the best invention since movable type will get you an instant [[permaban]]. Such practices have since infected the remainder of the forums, making NeoGAF the place to be for gamers who want to have their thoughts moderated by an autocratic [[dumbfuck]].
