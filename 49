'''1chan''' is an image board created by a guy called thatdog (who rarely posts on his own board), and is home to a group of [[troll]]s, railroaders, foamers, [[Furry|furries]], [[The YouTube Thomas Club|Thomas fags]] and [[weeaboo]]s [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|who's goal it is to be the one who knows the most about trains.]]

==Spelling==
Since a majority of the stupid fucks on 1chan can't spell worth a [[shit]], someone with real grammar skills will groom this bad boy up on a weekly basis. If things start looking like they were written by a 20-something-year-old with the mentality of a 5-year-old (like Ham549), you diagnosed the problem accurately. Fear not, by Friday each week, things will be cleaned up again.

==How to troll 1chan==
[[Image:Troll1chan.png|right|thumb|1chan trolling example]]
[[Image:1270168724937.jpg|right|thumb|5. <s>Post this in every thread</s> Not a mod no more! =D]]
# Make a thread asking something about trains. They will swarm to your thread trying to be the first one and show off there trainoligy or what ever you may call it. Once the Sauce is delivered, others will continue follow up with other related information to top the previous poster.
# Post anything slightly furry related. This will immediately induce a retaliatory post from Ham549, usually of anti-furry art (ironic since he is a furry himself) or something to do with the [[F40PH]]. Note: If they sage and post pictures of train crashes, that means they don't like the thread anymore.
# Post anything Genesis-related, or anything that remotely hints at defamation of the F40PH. The latter will provide the best results.
#* It should best be noted here that anything not to Ham549's liking WILL result in drama. He considers himself "King [[Shit]]", "Overwatch", "[[God]]", and "Head [[Cock]]" of 1chan, though as the great SooLine once said, "Ham has yet to learn that incendiary opinions and responses are best kept to himself, and as such inevitably will say some form of asshattery, a trend known all too well to all of us. The temptation of witnessing a [[rage|Hamsplosion]] is too great for some to avoid, so instigation ensues with predictable, and sometimes entertaining, results."
# Get into an editing war on the 1chan ED page, which at this rate won't be around for much longer.

==The Employees==
There are a few members of 1chan who actually [[job|do this shit for a living]] on a daily basis. These individuals, otherwise regarded as heros and professionals of their trade, are equally as fail as the rest of 1chan for coming home from work and .....oh yeah, discussing moar trains!

He even runs a chan site with [[Jay Naylor|Jay Naylor]] called U18 chan that host tons of furry porn, Also Draws/Traces shitty furry porn. He trolls the shit out of Ham. But 1chan always seems to fogive him when he actualy contributs to the board with things such as his model train layout.http://www.furaffinity.net/user/abitfur4u/
