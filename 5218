Mary Moon eSchwa e-rape
{{needsnomore|logs}}

===Synopsis===

These logs are transcripts of the great [[Mary Moon]] [[naked|unveiling]] after the users of her favorite [[Citadel]] system decided that they were sick about her lies of having never been a [[camwhore]].  For full [[lulz|understanding]], it is imperative that you read [[Mary Moon]] before viewing these logs.

The first logset is from 2005, when she was originally humiliated amongst her peers for being a [[cunt]] and making off like her past was [[Shit|pristine]].  The [[drama]] started when a mysterious user (amusingly enough never accused of having started aforementioned drama) posted links to her [[List of sex moves|spread eagle]] shots on the eSchwa [[LiveJournal]] community.

The second logset was from a failed attempt to restart the drama without any provocation in 2007.  Fortunately for [[Mary Moon]], [[Livy]]'s drama from [[Pedophilia|student fucking]] at his university, and the subsequent loss of everything he cared for in the world, ended up overshadowing her precious plastic [[cunt]].  He may well soon be added to the great list of [[an hero|heroes]].  Perhaps another day soon [[Mary Moon]]'s [[vagina]] will again make its way into the drama as eSchwa continues to wither and [[die]].  The only real drama that occurred as a result of the 2007 attempt was [[Mary Moon]]'s clone, [[Diabolical]], viewing her <strike>own</strike> sister's page on ED and demanding that it be taken down after it made the front page of ED.

===The Great E-Rape of 2005===

The following logs are from eSchwa, a [[Citadel]] system run by [[the man|the bitch]] [[Mela]].

Okay, I know this is going to be unpopular but who cares.

I personally don't know that much about Mary Moon or Diabolical and I certainly
wouldn't call either a friend. And I rarely agree with either of them about
anything.

But what happened here worries me. Not that Zero Cool collected a link to the
pictures MM once made. I understand why he did that. What worries me is that
people here mocked her for it. It reduces someone to their sexuality (or
physical appearance) and is no better than me starting to call some of you fat,
ugly, or stupid. It isn't a case of "hey, she made these pictures, she has to
live with it." I like to think that this is a community of friends (maybe I'm
wrong about that) and we're above belittling someone for something of this
nature.

This "camwhore" stuff that was posted, and now deleted, is sexual intimidation
and it makes me ill.

How and the world this places survives with all the racist, sexist bullshit
that goes on.....I just don't know. Unless it's okay to rip into them, because
they're not cool. I guess that's the only thing that makes any sense.

Why would this place not survive, what with the world at large surviving

criteria, this place is better than many.

You want a non-camwhore-badspeak policy?

I don't think its using her sexuality to demean her.  I think its using
something she did in her past to demean her.

I'm not saying it right (or that anyone should care), but given that mixed
messages she sends out about it anyways, well, I don't know.  (The hah, I got
free stuff but didn't really do anything, but don't say I ever did that thing.)

I mean, I think if she "owned" the experience, it'd have less power.

I'd disagree that this was "in kind." But that's another issue. They shouldn't
have belittled Misquoted either. (I don't read Diet>, so I don't know what was
said).

And honestly, if this was done to "get back at her," it's even fucking worse. I
mean are we really going to reduce a situation to "well, I don't agree with
you, or I hate you, so I'm going to humiliate you by reminding everyone in the
community of some penthouse like pictures you once made."

I guess I'm just bitching about the weird thing here that goes on where someoen
brings up something that people did in their past.  People get all pissy and
say that either they didn't do it, or they didn't do it to the extent people
are claiming.  People prove that the person did actually do it, and suddenly,
its the "people" who point out the truth that are at fault.

It's like if I insisted I never worked at pizza hut.  And then someone shows a
picture of me at pizza hut, holding a sign saying "I work at pizza hut" while
making a pizza.  And then I get pissy for someone pointing out that I'm a big
ol' liar liar.

Yeah sure, and everything you put in that post, Platypus, would have been said
as an excuse by all the boys in my middle school who made fun of girls for
having sex (most of whom probably didn't have sex). Well, if they had thought
they needed an excuse at all. But the post could apply exactly.

But my impression certainly is that Mary Moon gets pretty 'catty' herself too,
and generally likes making insulting other female BBS users looks. Who knows
who 'started' it. It's all pretty fucking ridiculous.

Platypus is right that bragging about this behavior makes it a lot less
demeaning when someone talks about it, particularly when it's in answer to
some kind of "starch assault".  Or if it doesn't, well, it makes me not
give a shit.

Gee, that reminds me of the sexual politics of middle school even more. Not
that they dont' persist beyond middle school, obvoiusly, but in our modern
'post-feminist' society people generally learn to do it much more subtly by the
time they are adults.

I really don't think Mary Moon is the issue. It's not her, it's us. She is who
she is, good, bad, whatever. But the way we respond to it strikes me as
degrading to women (and not just her, but all women) and the sort of sexual
politics that's more at home in a locker room.

Regardless of what she did or how she approaches her past, nothing MM has done
makes that level of humiliation (and it is sexual due to the very nature of it)
acceptable in the least.
You don't post sexually humiliating pictures of people because they said
something mean. You don't post sexually humiliating pictures of people.

There's been a lot of talk on here about how we're such a great community. What
kind of community do you think we are when people decide to do things like
that? Fleep's mom said she was thankful that Fleep had this community. Would
she be as proud of us knowing what happened?
What kind of place have we become if we can't trust that our secrets, which we
all have, won't be brought out as a way to intimidate us? Every one of us has
something in our past that we're not proud of. Do you want it dug up and
plastered all over eschwa the next time someone here gets pissy?

It's wrong, and we should all be ashamed of ourselves for it.

Let's have a little sequence of events, shall we.

1. At least 100 years ago, Mary Moon takes naked pics on cam, some of which
   contain captions like, and I quote, "Vote + for Jas on Camwhores and I'll
   flash," "Boob shot when Jas gets to + 30," "...Another flash at + 75!" and
   so on.  These pictures, and the doll-o-matic tagged ones, were clearly
   intended for public distribution.  Some others, who knows -- maybe they were
   and maybe they weren't.

2. The public, using the Intarnets to which said pix were distributed over,
   saves and trades the pix.

3. Some folks post them to various forums and web sites and they float around
   like the proverbial piss in the Intarnets swimming pool.  Once it goes in,
   you can't get it out.

4. Last thursday, Mary Moon starts slagging on people in Diet>.  There is
   chortling about this in various fora.

5. As a result, people start Googling and posting URLs they find with the pix.

6. The URLs are pasted about.

7. The pix are mirrored.

8. The pix are fuskered.

9. More than 12 people see the pix but otherwise all is quiet.

10. Mary Moon publicly claims that she got all sortsa phat l3wt for going on
    cam and never getting nekkid.

11. O RLY?

Dude, fuck that.  How about you not be nasty because it's not, well, necessary?

Also, Gord, the link between 4 and 5 just fucking sucks, sincerely.  Because MM
slags people in Diet>, the response is ... bring out her camwhore pics?  What.

And, you know, I get all levels of grief for any number of things, all of which

time I turned 25 or so that if I say it publically, then it can get thrown back

Here's my theory:

1.  This is outside the idea that peopel are meaner on the internets than in
person, first off.
2.  Once upon a time, there was Heinous.  And on Heinous, the folks who were
cool and in charge were pretty cutting and snarky and mean.
3.  If you weren't a cool kid, you got hit with a lot of that.  Most people
either left never to return, or got mean in return.
4.  Most of the folks on here weren't part of the cool kids to begin with, and
either were hit with the crap from the original mean kids, or got it from the
secondary mean kids.
5. So, eeryone who stays ends up either mean, or very tolerant to mean.

I went to pick up my family, but Thufir has, as usual, pretty much outlined my
position on this matter. No one is claiming that Mary Moon has been a good
citizen. But this is just fucked up.

I mean, no one is going to send (or better send) that picture of Fleep around
to her family or work or whatever. And no one should call her fat, or a whore,
for taking it to begin with. We won't do that because (most of us) like Fleep.
But I'm pretty sure she would be pissed off to all hell if we did.

This is just dirty. We are bad, bad people if we get joy from her pain over
this.

slag on me- oh well. The fucking guy's in Michigan. How is that relevant to my
real life? I sincerely doubt we each sit down to dinner mentally conniving to
slag on each other the next time were online.

And that's how I view everyone's life on here. This is a group. It's not a
lifestyle.  What people choose to do with their lifestyles is only relevant to
the group if they decide to share it, and even then, if they omit details, who
gives a fuck?

So in that light, what Zero Cool did was a major invasion of privacy. It's

If something isn't posted publically, it isn't exactly public. It isn't even
really public then, if the person posting them is the author or owner of the
content.

There's a problem from just that point of view alone.  The page could probably
be subjected to a DMCA takedown notice if they were ganked from a members only
site or anything that had an explicit copyright notice or terms of service.

So if nothing else, I think there's a problem if there is stuff out there being
shown that MM owns being distributed or having been obtained that violates her
ownership of that stuff and her moral rights as a copyright owner.

Just to take the *sex* out of it for a minute, I think a lot of folks would
have been up in arms if these were MP3 files of MM' copyrighted music, and they
were being put up to mock her for her musical ability.

If a user is hosting content that another user owns and has asked to take down,
I think that's a problem.

of the pictures, I've deleted them from my possession as well...because my

i am seeing two arguments made by diabolical: one that the pictures were

to profit from people viewing them. either of these arguments stands alone.
but they are contradictory when argued together. as for your example thufir,
you might be embarrassed and humiliated if someone took your pictures and
posted them online without your knowledge and permission. the part you left out
is selling them yourself. that sort of negates the "i am so humiliated"
argument. i am not saying this was okay; i am saying diabolical cannot have it
both ways. as for mary moon, comparing other eschawn females to dogs makes me
think she is not all that humiliated and embarrassed. although diabolical may

-Maybe- ZC thought they would be a collection of some softie soft porn, because
that is what they are. As I remember, the pictures popped up years ago the
first time I saw them. I didn't see them all at the same time though, they were
in various places. Then maybe a month ago they popped up again as a collection.
This collection seemed to come about as a response to a multitude of posts on
body issues that focused around MM having a rocking bod, and others - not so
much. People were all, "Damn, she's really full of her bod." Then other people
were all, "Yeah here, check it out." More and more photos crawled out of the
woodwork and ZC collected them like any other porn. This makes sense to me,
when I take the Mary Moon out of the picture and just think, "Hey look, a
nekkid girl." The cruelty is not in ZC collecting them, that is the normal
thing people do with porn, right? The naughty part is when they landed smack

Pass #2:

The empbarrassment/humiliation does not arise from the images, but from the
betrayal of trust.

Madonna has every reason to consider all those hairy armpit photos of herself
to be aesthetically pleasing, but remain humiliated by their publication
because it was not she who published them.  Vanessa Williams nude is a glorious
thing, but still humiliating to Vanessa Williams if she did not control the
images.  And so on.

Understand the claim here - it is not that the materials are inherently
humiliating, but that bringing them up in a specific context is humiliating.

You, Ptolemy, are a masturbator, or abnormal.

What are you trying to accomplish by posting that, Bonzo? Let me clarify: The
content of the pictures remains sensitive and potentially embarrassing-
however, at least by virtue of a credit card transaction, it becomes an
agreement between two consenting people.

When someone else takes those pics and posts them, there is no consent. Or, if
someone gets pics under false circumstances, that is also nonconsensual.
Does that make sense? At least the transaction implies mutual consent. But Mary
Moon essentially letting one person see pics isn't carte blanche for everyone
to have them. That would be like saying that since the person paid her for
pics, she has the right to their credit card number.

Yeah, well, I still maintain that the onus of behavior is not on all humans to
tread super-carefully so that they may not, with luck, do anything that might
possibly rebound upon them in the future.  It'd be nice if we all had such
far-seeing vision, but alas we do not.

Of course people are mean.  You, general you, can endeavor not to be one of
those mean people.  The community, as in eschwa, can also endeavor to not
tolerate such behavior, and ostracize those who take part in it.  These are
where the onuses lie.  MM goes on about her hawt looks because the community
ogles her; if you dislike that, stop ogling her.  People drag out others' dirty
laundry on the pretense that it is easily locatable; if you dislike that, don't
associate with those who have this reprehensible habit.  Etc.

Yes, one solution is, never say anything or do anything that might possibly
rebound upon you in any way.  It's sad that this has to be the only solution,
however, because it doesn't.  You may not be able to _control_ the behavior of
others, but you can _influence_ it.  Encourage things you like, discourage
those you don't.  And quit making excuses for those who stoop even lower than
the previous person did, because in the end, that's what it boils down to when
you say it's _everyone's_ fault.  That's rarely the case; it's just a
convenient dodge we use because nobody likes to assign blame, lest blame
somehow be assigned to them.  There's almost always someone who steps over the
line in situations like these.

Yeah, I don't think anyone except Mary Moon is arguing that it would be somehow
morally justified to retailiate by one-upping here, but I still think it's
important to note that somewhere along the line things went from "average level
of eschwa snark" to a step further, and that's what we should be looking at
when analyzing "deplorable continuums" like these, instead of mouthing the
obvious platitude that Someone Has To Stop Themselves.

Sure, whatever, if MM starts going on about how she wants to send a post of
ZC's personal habits to her boss and then does so, and then ZC retaliates by
publishing her webcam photos in Penthouse or something, twit them both and
fucking have done already.  No sense allowing multiple children in the sandbox.
And we have a long-standing precedent here that off-bbs harassment of schwans
by other schwans is grounds for twittal.

I maintain that's not only obvious, but maddeningly so.  It completely skates
over issues of escalation and inappropriate behavior.  To boil the incident
down to this simple point is to equate all offenses equally:  a rude comment
made in-passing becomes the moral equivalent of ruining someone's life by

I'm still way back after having gone out for dinner, but I wanted to clarify a
couple things:

Okay, let's get a couple things straight.

1. ZC didn't Google the majority of the pics.  A user who shall remain
   nameless and who I judge to be reliable and honest (and to have no reason
   to lie about it) Googled them in "under ten minutes" was the phrase
   I believe they used.  The link got out on Utopia around the time of
   the Peanut Butter Cup Debate.

   This user did the Googling and link-pasting of their own accord, based
   on things being discussed Utopia during discussion stemming from the
   Peanut Butter Cup Debate and flaming of Heidi.  I cannot go into any
   further detail on the actual discussion as it would violate the rules of
   Neutron Star>, Utopia's Black Hole> equivalent.

2. The pics weren't posted as 'revenge' for the Peanut Butter Flaming.
   In fact, the majority were posted on the web in December 2004, presumably
   NOT by any BBS user.  It is my understanding that ZC mirrored them
   because the format they were presented in was annoying, and Fusker was
   convenient.  I think all of you are damn well aware enough of ZC's habits
   to know he could give a rat's ass about some flaming over peanut butter
   cups, other than to post an amusing one-liner over it.  He does, however,
   like the titties.

   The mirroring/Fuskering happened to coincide, a few days later to the
   best of my memory, with the Peanut Butter Cup Debate because -people
   were talking about Mary Moon and her tits during that time.-  That is
   the causal link.

3. The pics weren't brought up as "revenge" for anything as near as I can
   tell.  The Fusker existed for over a MONTH before it hit the eschwa
   LJ community.  The Fusker was linked only AFTER Mary Moon lied about
   not getting naked on cam while bragging about all the l3wt she got for
   it.  That is the causal link that led to the linking of the Fusker,
   and the greater eschwa community becoming aware of it.

You all are assigning actions and motives to Zero Cool that he simply didn't
do or possess.  All he did was mirror the pics and Fusker them.

Of course, my assertions here are worth just as much as ZC's or Mary Moon's.
I could be lying, but I'm not.  *shrug*

I'm making official policy here. If you don't bother to pay attention to it and
you are bitten on the ass, I'm sorry. You should have read it in the first
place:

I don't think that wearing a short skirt in a dark alley means you're asking to
be taken advantage of, and I don't think because someone has something online
that can embarrass them means they should be embarrassed.

Harassment on and off this BBS will not be tolerated. If I can be convinced
that you have harassed someone, you will no longer have write access to this
BBS for as long as I deem necessary.

I am not going to ex-post-facto ZC and twit him for this (as it isn't entirely
clear to me anyway that he was the guy who orchestrated the harassment), but I
am quite serious that this tit-for-tat bullshit is not acceptable now, or ever.

I'll redo the analysis if I have to, but the fact remains that Utopia does not
exist "only to rag on eschwa users," he said tiredly.  The last time I bothered
to check, Star>, the only room in which ragging on ANYONE is allowed (and this
is enforced unlike on here) comprised under 5% of the traffic in the top ten or
so rooms.

We mostly talk about food, followed by entertainment.  But mostly food.
Sometimes work.  Surprise, it's a fucking normal BBS.

As for the claims of 'orchestrated harassment,' bullshit.  Nothing was
orchestrated.  A chain of events occurred which led to the posting of nude pix
of Mary Moon at a particularly inopportune time for her.  People can try to be
all Fox News and frame the debate all day long, but the fact remains, there was
no "orchestrated harassment."

Dec 16, 2005 22:59 from Mary Moon

I always cared about it. But what, exactly, should I have done about it?
Said, "Stop talking about me!"? Would that have stopped anyone? No, they
just would've run off to whatever Super-Sekrit Room they created to talk
and smirk about it there, making sure the targeted party never saw
anything more than vague, snarky references on this BBS that grazed the
line of topicality without ever quite crossing over. It's the same shit
people've been doing for the last fifteen goddamn years. Did anyone
actually think they were being so clever that nobody else got the
reference? Do you think I have a two-minute memory span, or what? Do you
think I'm just so out of the loop that I just didn't ever get it until
now? Do you think nobody knows about your little secret rooms but you?
A three-year-old could figure it out.

My not responding to it is me not being a fucking toddler, not me failing
to get the reference. Just so we're clear on that. The re-emergence of the
topic on a regular basis is other people being fucking toddlers, not me.
I have the nuts to confront people, a characteristic of which people are
undoubtedly vastly familiar. I don't need a secret room and a campaign to

And you got a result from the sysop saying, No, we didn't have a rule like this
before, so we're going to make one because of you.

We've already established that the "you don't know how to act in real life"
applies to you as much as it does to anyone else.  Or would you allow Mr. Beale
to post a transcript of your private conversation slagging your co-workers as
dogs on the office bulletin board?  Office email list?  Yeah, OK.  We all act
like shitheads online.  ZC stepped over the line, to the point where we had to
make a rule about it.  And that's where we are now.  Ex-post-facto justice,
however, isn't justice at all.  There's a reason that isn't allowed in the US.
[Bitch About BBS Policy Here> msg #6685 (0 remaining)] Read cmd ->

Dec 16, 2005 23:19 from Mary Moon

The part about not knowing how to act in public is the fact that we
actually had to have a rule in place about not harassing users online.
After 15 years of BBSing, most of it on ISCA, which had a very clear
anti-harassment policy. And the fact that the apparent orchestration
of this crap took place on a BBS with no such policy is indicative that
people knew it wasn't acceptable behavior here. So they did it where it
was acceptable behavior. You can spare me the platitude about how I'm
just as bad and how everyone does it, because the simple fact of the
matter is that I don't go somewhere and gather shit about people and post
it somewhere and then send people the link so we can all laugh at folks
behind their backs. Everyone knows that if I feel particular scorn toward
a person, I do it to their face, which isn't exactly *better*, but I'm
certainly not doing all this clandestine shit. All assholes are equal, but
some assholes are more equal than others.

Not to break up the whatever-fest here, but would this new policy also cover
things of the non-humiliation (or whatever happened with MM) type?  (I.. can't
keep up with y'all this time.  Sorry.)

For instance, would the following things that have been Issues here before be
considered harassment and thus ass kicking:

1. Threatening to call the cops on another user
2. Googling, researching, whatever to dig up dirt on the life of a user's
   friends or family (ie, does it still apply if it's not an actual user)
3. Using BBS information to email, snail mail or otherwise pester users
   offline

And whatever other various shitstorms past I have forgotten, just some
examples.  Is this other stuff also no longer going to be tolerated,
punishable by twitting and so on and so forth, or just actual posted-on-BBS
crimes against actual BBS users?

I mean, say I make an argument in a forum, and someone violently disagrees with
me.  They are irritated, and because the topic has passed or been called off
by the mod, they take it to their LJ to post how stupid my argument was, and
all the many reasons why I'm wrong or whatnot.  I then feel embarrassed
because my point was ripped to shreds and it makes me look stupid.

The user's express purpose in taking it off-BBS was to rip my post.  This
caused me embarrassment (and I would probably feel that way, were it to happen

Dec 17, 2005 0:49 from Monkey

Whoa. Damn.

There is a serious gap between some of the threats discussed here today
(reporting someone as a terrorist, reporting someone for drug abuse, reporting
someone to child protective services) and the kind of wanky shit people engage
themselves in from one BBS to another. This should be easy to see. If someone
runs on over to another BBS and posts, "Monkey is such a fucking assmaster.
That dipshit stoner bitch. She hates America and children and apple pies." this
statement will not hurt me at all. It's someone's opinion. Some of it is true,
but statements can be disregarded. It's much harder to disregard Homeland
Security on your doorstep, or the police, or DHS taking your children away
right before your eyes. By the way, I like apple pie.

I do not think it is harassment to dig up information on people when what you
dig up is public information. Court records are a good example. You can check
mine out. I'm a speeder, but I haven't been caught in a speed trap for a good
long time. I got a divorce. That's about what you'll learn and this isn't the
end of the world. If something worse is in your public records/information then
the BBS is probably the best of all bad places for that shit to land. The BBS
is likely not going to employ you anytime soon.

And this is where I have trouble drawing the line. If someone had sent MM's
nude photos to her workplace, her grandparents, her bank, or something like
that I'd say that's clearcut harassment. No one did that so far as I know. The
photos were passed around between people online, many who had already seen
them. The photos were passed around between people in a format made easy by ZC,
but since when did difficulty level make people stop looking at things they
want to see. He didn't make it that much easier. They were floating around
online already for years now. It's pretty easy to think photos like that are
quite public when they're right out there and then treat them as such.

What if I made a ton of porn under the name Shelly Tyler and spread it all over
the internet? Then what if ZC took an interest in my boobies and collected the
whole works and posted it here, exposing me as totally not Shelly Tyler, but
instead just me. I'd call the damage minimal. Online folks see flocks and
bunches of online booty. I'd draw the line at the point where it went beyond
the BBS and live journal, etc. If someone sent something like that to say, my
grandfather or an employer then I'd put a stop to it in a way I am no longer
allowed to detail here.

I have such awful cramps. I wish I could sleep. I hope any of that made sense.

Ok, I'm not excited where this is headed...the "what happens in vegas, stays in
vegas" kind of post restriction.  "Black Hole"> has that rule about it's
content...that users cannot take posts made in there and post them elsewhere,
as well as that you discuss what's been posted AND you can't even go to someone
and X/Mail> them with a "oh, oh....you should go see what they are saying about
you in there" kinda of shit.

So to clear some shit up, and to prevent either Diabolical or Mary Moon from
making a public post/Mail>/X to someone that contains "I know you did it" and
still be _completely_ fucking wrong, i need to talk about some events from
"black Hole">...tho i hope Neurophyre can see past the strictness of the rules
he set up, and allow me to stay...because if MM is going to Mail me shit like
"thanks for keeping your address public" or post publically something to the
effect of "now I know ZC's boss's home address" and make even a thinly veiled
threat to me, you better do it for the right reasons.  But seeing as how your
mind was madeup from the jump, this is really so the rest of the class is
brought up to speed so if they continue to agree/disagree with what i did they
can at least be fully informed about doing so.  One thing you guys love in your
arguments is being annoying precise about content.


Figure as far back as you can remember the first time Mary Moon went into a
frenzy about eating habits in Diet>.  I think this really got started during
the "counting Carbs" issue.  I don't read every post i miss out on unless it
interests me, so i've skipped a lot of posts in there, so my timeline may be
off, this could have started even before then.  so what...that was in like the
begining of Nov...or a little after.  In Black Hole> ( and i'm using this term
since that's how it keeps getting mentioned in this thread ) it was brought to
the attention that Mary Moon had a past that involved pictures, and that there
was probably still copies of them in the ether.  Proof was asked for by some of
the subscribers of the room.  proof was obtained and provided by the user that
brought it to our attention in the form of 6 or so seperate links.  Because I
felt this was a terrible waste of time to have to go through each site to see
a picture, or to click a link to click a link to click a link to see a pictures
i opened each site in it's own tab, then went through and added each picture to
it's own tab, then right-click save as the original file name.  i did this for
all...i think it was 249 pictures.  Now to be clear, i didn't have 249 tabs
opened at once...but you get the idea of how i culled the dataset.  After that
I needed to change the filename to something more linear, since they were a
mass of characters and dashes and whathave you....so i went through and
individually numbered them 01-249...by the end i was too lazy to make it
correctly 001-249 so they would show in numbered order, but by this time i was
probably already 2 hours into the process.

to think in this time span that everyone waited patiently for me to come back
and provide the link to the Fusker to see the pictures, as opposed to following
the links already proided to them is goddamn fucking ridiculous.

With the pictures renamed, i went on to make a subdomain.  this process took an
hour by itself becuase at the time i didn't know i could make a subdomain, let
alone what the fuck one was ( thanks to the collection of FAQ's on Dreamhost).
But lets just pretend it only took 35 seconds just to placate any objection
Mary Moon or her sister have at my competence in web hosts and hosting in
general.  Once the subdomain was created, the files were uploaded, and then I
used Fusker to mirror them in a viewable form so that all one had to do was
visit that Fusker link instead of the 6 links individually.  I returned back to
Black Hole> and provided the link.

This posting was on, to my very best recollection, on Nov 14th.  So....now
those users that subscribe to Black Hole> had one link to use instead of six.
Flash forward to the last 36 hours, and the link was posted on the live
journal.  This is where i'm fuzzy on the rules of Black Hole> because i figured
because i made the post of the link in there, it couldn't be posted
elsewhere...but i think because the pictures were already available in an
inconvient form ( 6 seperate links ), using my version was ok.  The last post i
saw on live journal was one of the readers commenting that the post made
wasn't a limerick.

I log in, have a Mail> from Mary Moon, and then I X GoNINzo that i see now the
thread was removed from the live journal.  He tells me, basically, Mary Moon
asked for it to be removed.  I check to see if the Fusker is still alive.  It
isn't, so i delete the photos from my host.  i get 12 minutes of peace and
harmony, and then Diabolical X's me a storm.

jesus...this turned into a 'too long; didn't read'...but I wanted try and make
clear what it was i've done and why it was done instead of watching people try
to explain it for me.

Mary Moon, I did not expect that link to be used in the way it was used...to be
posted on eschwa or live journal.  I've learned from the X's from your sister
and by you  that the history of the pictures is long and trust was broken, and
that you have had problems with users stalking or otherwise making your life
and probably your sister's life less than stellar.  I can see from your point
of view how what i did smacks some semblace of that kind of malicious
behaviour, however that was not my intent.  Trying to humiliate you was not my
intent.  Trying to "get back," trying to one-up, trying to do anything you've
convinced yourself of was not my intent.  My intent was to make the Fusker.
And as i've said before, since the fusker is gone, so are the pictures i had.
If i were trying to be malicious, i would still make them avaialable.  Or i
would have posted them on this bbs back when i made them, or made a live
journal account and added them as a thread.  But no...i posted them in the
"super seekrit room," where prior links already existed.

I am sorry, Mary Moon, that the link was used on live journal, and if it was
posted on eschwa, i'm sorry it was posted over here as well.  I'm sorry that my
actions have you now thinking diffferently about the entire userbase, or at
very least thinking differently about any other users besides me.  And I'm
sorry to Diabolical for any backlash she got because of those postings, and if
you got a KO from Weird> because you were upset with me.  And finally I would
like to apologize to the userbase for having to sit through this post...or to
have to at least <s>kip it.

you can go about posting your clever tl;dr thingie now.

I think Mela's policy is a good one. These things have been brewing under the
surface for years. And I can quite clearly tell you that I am still pissed off
at what happened to Slit, even though I don't know her, because I quite clearly
expect more from you people than that.

I think we can have a clear sense of right and wrong, and should not try to
turn this into some sort of legalism (a set of rules divorced from intent). The
rule at it's heart should be "don't do stupid shit that hurts other people or
causes them problems in the real world."

If you do, you're perma-twitted.

Quite frankly, this is the very kind of thing that would run me off the board
for good, and many others as well.

Basically, what we have here is a combination of users on both boards who
either have absolutely no moral compass, or have absolutely no sense of
decency. It's pretty obvious which are which.

All in all, I didn't really have high expectations of a lot of people on this
board, but this really takes the cake. You people that were involved in this
are some kind of low class, I'll say that much. You're just...miserable. You
must be, to orchestrate something that's obviously premeditated. Just for what?
So you can snark at someone on a Forum, because you didn't like what they said
in another forum?

"Get a life" doesn't even cut it. Get professional fucking help. Or put a gun

Even after my long ass post, Mary Moon, you are still getting it wrong.  Are

if you read every other line.  Let me fix your post for you:

Okay. Someone asked for links to my pictures because of what I said in Diet>.
Someone collected several links and posted them in Black Hole>.  Zero Cool
visited all the images, copied them, renamed them, hosted them on his host,
uploaded them to a webpage, and posted the link in Black Hole>.


There's a reason why i am being specific about what i've done.  To read the

I guess it's matter of opinion.  I don't think what i did was malicious because
the links were already to be had by the room, so what was the big deal in
collating them.  I guess also maliciousness can be branded based on intent.
had my intent been to spread the link in areas other than Black Hole> that
would certainly be beyond malicious.

So, publishing the pictures and then posting the link where people would see
it *isn't* malicious, in your mind? Because it was only in one area, not
in others? That's the explanation I'm supposed to buy?

The whole fucking activity was malicious. You did it (you, personally, and
you, the people collectively involved) in order to exact revenge for what
I said in Diet>. You, Zero Cool, were the single largest organizer of the
event in question. By your own admission.

Mary Moon and/or Diabolical:  not that I am not in agreement with your points,
but I honestly want to know why you (either of you) are still arguing this
here.  Mela has read the content, weighed in with a new policy that will
punish, arguably to the maximum of her authority, anyone who does something
like this again.  Since the rule was not in place when this happened, it can't
be retro-applied but basically, she's put her foot down in a big way, on your
side of the fence.  What are you wishing to accomplish or prove further that
hasn't already been done or said?

The whole problem here is that there seems to have been evidence floating
around on the 'net that could be used to directly counter claims and statements
that Mary Moon was making about herself, while she was attacking people in
Diet> for doing the very things that the evidence blatantly shows she herself
was guilty of doing.

As an apparant exhibitionist, the photos themselves aren't embarrassing or
she'd have never have done such a blatantly voyeuristic activity in the first
place.


Basically, if you are going to go on the attack and rail against other people
for doing something which you yourself have been guilty of doing in the past,
you'd better make damn sure there's no evidence of your past actions floating
'round on the 'net that can be used to "out" you and make you look like the
fraud you really are.

This is all being piled on ZC for being one of the ones that helped organize
that evidence, but it really comes back to MM for being naive about how
accessible that evidence is on the 'net. Don't go attacking others if you've
got ammo against you that can be easily found and used to shoot your argument
out of the sky.

I'm not naive at all. This is about the dozenth time that people have done
this, on one BBS or another, because someone invariably makes a remark about
it where I can see it, or asks me about it. I know perfectly well that the
information is out there and that I'm powerless to call it back, and that
some people are jackasses enough to bring it up to the attention of others
for no other reason than just to do it. Believe me, I know it better than
anyone else on this board. However, I'm not going to live my life in a
fucking bubble of silence because people are assholes, and I'm not going
to treat anyone differently from the way they treat me.

That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Tell us another bedtime story, Scalar.
what "evidence" refutes claims that MM made in Diet>? The argument in question
was about carb counting and nutrition. What exactly does posting a bunch of
pics do to "refute" that?

And since when is making a post in a forum justifiable grounds for uploading
someone's pics to fusker without their permission?

I'm sure that you, Neurophyre, and Zero Cool could post chapters and chapters
to obfuscate the issue, which is that Neurophyre and Zero Cool, amongst others,
decided to rally together and gather up and post a bunch of pics about someone
in retaliation for some supposed inconsistency in a post.

Yes, because we all know the inherent honor that lies in omissions and topical
posting. Fie on he or she that dare not own up to their own behavior of several
years ago.

It's obvious what you guys did. And it's repugnant, and you showed a pretty low
demonstration of moral standard. Vilify? You *should be vilified.*  There's
just no reasonable justification for what you guys did, sorry. Not in the real
world.

as you want to categorize me, it's pretty clear from reading thru all this
blather that you brought this on yourself.

You can dish it out but can't take it when it gets thrown back in your face.
From all the past shitstorms on here, it's clear that Mary Moon is very good at
dishing it out.

It shouldn't be a suprise that there's a certain rumbling collective interested
in taking her down a notch, even if to just do it privately as was the original
intent (apparantly).

===The Beginnings 2007===
After the creation of the [[Mary Moon]] page, it took some time for lulz to begin brewing.  Eventually [[Mary Moon]] was selected for the ED frontpage.  At this time the instigators of the lulz decided that the time for patient waiting for the lulz was over.

Despite numerous bannings from the [[eSchwa BBS]] by the local [[the man|jackbooted thug]], [[Mela]], perpetrators of the lulz managed to get in and drop links to the ED front page.  The postings only managed to stay up for about 10 minutes; luckily, this was over lunch hour at the 9-5 jobs that the [[yuppie|yuppie scum populous]] as a majority hold.

With [[drugs|lightning speed]], [[Mela]] dropped the hammer, banning new users that were not identified up to her standards or verified by other users.  You can help change this policy by immediately telnetting to [telnet://bbs.eschwa.com|eSchwa] and creating as many new accounts as possible from as many different IPs as possible.

At this point in time the lulz are still brewing on both eSchwa and Utopia, dammit! BBS.  This is a present log of the only recorded and since modified history of the lulz:

Here's the deal. We love new people, right? Right?

Due to recent trollitude and asshattery, I'm going to institute a referral
system here. If you refer someone here, please Y>ell to me their handle/name
and I'll make sure that they're validated quickly. I'll contact those without
referrals to tell me where they found Eschwa. It's far from foolproof, but it
will hopefully quell some of that garbage.

And if you're just here to stir up trouble, we'd be mightily obliged to see you

unfair in your eyes, but I believe that this BBS will not survive without these
drastic measures.
