'''''Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue''''' truly is the best [[cartoon]] ever because it's amazingly [[gay]]. It premiered on television in 1990, much to the anticipation of [[over 9000]] children who wanted to see their favorite cartoon characters fight the [[Scientology|ultimate foe]] or just [[Buttsecks|to chill and hang out]]. What could have been an [[epic]] half hour romp was nothing more than a thirty minute public service announcement against [[drugs]].

Jim Davis canceled it because it [[I accidentally X|accidentally]] featured [[Garfield]]. What an ass... or an awesome [[Gay|guy]]. I can't tell.

The absolute best part of the cartoon is that after the credits it ends with a bunch of retarded kids singing about [[love]] and [[McDonald's]] and how [[drugs]] are bad.  After a half-hour of dumb ass cartoon characters stumbling over each others' dicks to stop some little snot from puffing on [[Drug|weed]], singing 'tards coming out of nowhere provided [[lulz|the biggest laugh of all time]].


==Premise==
[[Image:CARTOONALLSTARSZOMMMBBIIEEE.jpg|thumb|right|One symptom of drug use is no pulse, body temperature is down to room temp, craving for human flesh and pink puffy eyes. Yes it's all about Michael Jackson]]
A little cocktease has her piggybank stolen and some cartoon characters set off to investigate. It turns out her teenage brother is the culprit and it's because he *gasp* smokes [[weed]] (and eventually, crack.) Wow, a teenager is experimenting with drugs??? Only on TV folks. To make matters worse (or better), the boy's pot smoke is alive and wears a business suit and keeps sliding his smoky dick into the boy's nostrils.

A wide array of [[republican]] cartoon characters from all the big [['80s]] cartoons of the time try to stop the guy from doing pretty much what every [[Kewlies|cool]] teenager does by traumatizing the shit out of him. Especially Alf, that fuck. After finding out the truth about drugs (that they turn you into a really ugly [[zombie]] of course), the [[Gay|guy]] quits smokin' de herb and lives happily ever after and [[incest|a little too closely]] to his sister. Or at least until he gets a [[girlfriend]] and those dumb cartoon characters return and proceed to beat the [[Crap|shit]] out of him for having premarital [[sex]].

This cartoon is preceded by a special message from President Old-Bush, who informs us that [[Drug|drugs]] and alcohol are bad and that you'll never get anywhere if you use them.  As he was being filmed for this show, his son, [[dubya]], was stumbling around Tijuana with a tequila bottle [[In the ass|shoved up his ass]]. 

On a related note, here's what the [[Nostalgia Critic]] had to say about this historic piece of animated [[fail|win]].
