[[Last Thursday]], some smart ass guy said '''"Hey /b/, Your floor is now lava"''', and [[pedophile|fellow /b/tards]] started shitting bricks and posting different ways to evade the lava. [[Troll|Some guy]] assured everyone he was safe on his bed, [[Retarded|but unfortunately spelled bed "bee"]].

He was justly mocked, and someone produced a [[shoop]] of a boy evading the lava from the safety of his bee. Soon, a [[Oh exploitable|template]] was produced and [[torrent|torrents]] of tasty [[Original Content|OC]] issued forth. Thus was a [[Crap|shitty]] new [[meme]] born.

Within the context of the meme, it is understood that being on one's bee is a mark of safety, preparedness, status, bravery, or just luck. The best examples of "I'm on my bee" depict [[13-year-old boy|our brave hero]] on his bee, fleeing some kind of famous disaster or dangerous situation.

Most examples also choose to reference the original source, often stating "Good thing I'm on my bee."
