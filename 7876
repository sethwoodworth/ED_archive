[[Image:Sub_Chan_Alcoholic.jpg|thumb|left|Lol, I'd hit it!]]
'''Sub-chan''', '''Layla''', or '''HedgeCreature''' (formerly '''HazmatLatte'''), was an [[Art school|Artfag]] [[Indie|Indiefuck]]-[[Hipster]] [[Camwhore]] that posted sometime around June 8th or 9th of 2006 on [[4chan|4chan's]] [[b|/b/]]. Once she [[stripper|stripped]] for /b/, onlookers pointed out her sagging tits, which, especially when viewed from specific angles, appeared to resemble torpedoes; with their [[retarded|sound]] judgment, /b/ attributed the name "Submarine-chan," which was then shortened to "Sub-chan." In spite of her [[sloppy tits]], thousands of [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] [[newfag|newfags]] [[Pussy-whipped|drooled (and continue to do) over her as though she's a supermodel]].

When Sub-chan first posted on /b/, a few posters doubted the OP in question was actually her, which prompted her to post [[shit nobody cares about|video responses defending her claim to identity]]. Eventually, she left /b/, never to be seen again; extremely butthurt about her absence, newfags frequently attempt to amass personal armies to find her, often prompting [[ban|bans]] and [[X is not your personal army|NYPA]] reminders.

{{tinyquote|A sophomore painting major at the Lyme Academy of Fine Arts has been [[Shameless self-promotion|winning awards for her costume designs since she was in the 8th grade]]. While attending the Cooperative High School for Arts and Humanities in New Haven she entered costume conventions, consistently winning awards and [[Attention whore|gaining the attention of MTV]]. This summer MTV will be filming Layla in her studio at home working on both her paintings and costumes. [[Shit nobody cares about|Layla comes from a long line of artists including her great-grandfather who spent summers as part of the Old Lyme Art Colony in the early 1900’s]] and [[buttsecks|met her great-grandmother there]]. Her grandfather taught at the Art Student’s League in [[New York]] and specialized in [[Bullshit|spiritual art]]. Layla has also attended the Art Student’s League. Layla’s mother is a concert pianist, composer and teacher who consulted for the Dia Foundation in the [[Fag|Andy Warhol]] days|Quoted from [http://www.thewhaletrail.com/southeast/artists.asp this site]}}.

== LJ Drama ==

Before closing her LJ account, Sub-chan blogged about her [[batshit insane|unmedicated]] boyfriend Andrew.

Being the [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|sympathetic entity]] [[Anonymous]] is, they trolled her account. Unfortunately, Sub-chan [[Don't feed the trolls|did not feed the trolls]] and promptly [[An hero|closed her account]]

HOLYSHIT! ANDREW'S MYSPACE

== LurkMore Wiki Drama ==


[[Image:Sub_chan_lurkmorewiki.png|thumb|The Original Uncensored article]]


Being the [[white knight|valiant defenders]] of [[camwhores]] the [[The LURKMORE wiki|Lurkmore]] [[faggots|Sysops]] are, all information relating to Sub-chan has been [[delete fucking everything|censored]], the hits count reset, and the main article [[bawwwww|edited]]; apparently, it occurs to them by [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|removing information]], they will earn brownie-points and thus seduce their precious damsel-in-distress to bed.

You can help by getting your ass behind a proxy and backediting it; [[Raid|GOGOGO]].
