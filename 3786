'''Howard Dean''' tried to become president of America in 2004 but lost because he is secretly a [[Brokeback Mountain|gay cowboy]]. This has perplexed many a young [[democrat]], as his more successful rival George "[[Dubya]]" Bush obviously knows how to saddle a horse, if you know what I mean.

Dean was one of the first politicians to use the [[internets]] in his campaign.  All this achieved, however, was to alert users who weren't cocksucking [[fanboys]] to the fact that he has the IQ, diction and looks of an artificially [[retard|retarded]] rhesus monkey and he promptly [[failed]].

Scientists have found that the Dean's call can be heard from up to 7 miles away, and is speculated to be used to attract mates and frighten rivals. Recent findings, however, suggest the call is used mostly to inform other members of the troop where the Dean is going (usually New Hampshire and Idaho).
