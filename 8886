Wales
''Not to be confused with [[Jimbo Wales]] or [[Whales]]''<br><br>

'''Wales''' is a small [[socialist]] country next to [[England]] composed entirely of [[sheep]], rain, [[dragons]], [[an hero|an heroes]], traditional Music and [[Lord of the Rings|hobbits]]. Its capital is [[LOL WUT|Cardiff]], which looks good on the outside but belies an interior so decrepit that Glasgow sometimes fears for its position as the second most miserable place to live in Britain. The Welsh actually discovered [[America]] in 1170, which explains a lot. Not to mention a fucking shitload of [[Polish]] over-populating, especially in super wanky Wrexham. Wales are cetaceans which are neither [[dolphin]]s (i.e. members of the families Delphinidae or Platanistoidae) nor porpoises. Orcas (Killer Whales) and Pilot whales have "whale" in their name, but they are dolphins for the purpose of classification.

==History and culture==

The culture of Whales consists of a staple diet of coal, coal, beer, hating the [[English]], valium, coal, loving whoever is playing the English and corgis. The national food is the humble leek, although your typical Welshman is more likely to be found eating Welsh cakes. This substance is only marginally less indestructible than diamond, and about as edible. Wales has no famous musicians apart from a supposedly hilarious, [[rap]]-parodying band called [[Fag|Goldie Lookin' Chain]], who are failing tryhards and Tom Jones. And Manic Street Preachers, [[emo|Funeral for a Friend, Bullet for My Valentine, Lost Prophets]], and black person.  

They did have a commie punk scene back in the day which pioneered under-amped math rock and under-amped girly emo with drum machines.  If you ever spent time in an '80s college dorm with a "bohemian" girlfriend this may have been the make-out music that gave you impotence.
 
Wales actually has a load of history, the only problem being it was all written in [[Esperanto|Welsh]] and [[nobody gives a shit]] enough to translate it. What of Welsh history that is known largely consists of druids, stone circles, coal, and more druids. There is reliable evidence that the Lord of The Rings Trilogy gives us a brief insight into Welsh history but with more druids and sacramental wine. King Arthur supposedly came from Wales but they're probably making that up. Long ago, [[Ireland|Southern Irish]] people came to Wales one day after being washed ashore in a [[drunk|drunken]] stupor.  They introduced [[Guinness]] to the natives and left turkey-basters on the ground. This is sacred to the Welsh and the only way they procreate is by filling them with sperm and planting it in vaginas as most males are [[homosexual]], similarly to England.

In Wales they have pink bus shelters and on the road all the cones are upside down.  

There is a book of Welsh history named the <b>Maginoboginonignonigon</b> which to the Welsh is much like the [[Bible]] only less full of damnation and more full of sheep fucking. It was previously thought to be lost to the ages, but by the efforts of the wonderful [[transsexual|Stevie Nicks]] and her band Fleetwood Mac it was rediscovered, after they found the book and made a song about a character in it named [[Mr. Hands|Rhiannon]]. It was an epic Welsh tale of [[bestiality|a woman and her horse]], who is the mother of all [[British]] people today (except some English cunts in denial who think they are [[German|Aryan supermen]]). This is the reason why all Brits have bad, deformed teeth akin to a horses. 

[[At least 100 years ago]] Wales became a [[communism|communist]] country led by mining revolutionary [[Stalin]], in his dreams of domination. Wales is today ruled in the council Communist style with an ''assembly'' of [[fags|ministers]] led by current First Minister [[Alan Cox]]. The problem is that this government is in denial that Wales is actually part of [[England]] (whales is actually a mammal) and only have built a few shitty [[crap|modern art statues]] in Cardiff rather than doing anything as a result (at least that is their excuse). In Whales [[Microsoft]] is banned and all computers use [[Linux]], setting Welsh technology back by 50 years.

However, although officially Communist according to the Stalin government who no one gives a fuck about, Wales is in fact the richest part of the [[United Kingdom]] due to the economical reliance on Catherine Zeta Jones and [[Esperanto|Welsh travel books]] as a source of income. Welsh people often visit England and [[Scotland]] in horse driven carriages and mock the poor drug-dealers there, through being attacked by them the Welsh have resorted to dressing up in [[tranny|drag]] on Saint David's Day to make them run away in terror. Popular in the Welsh lowlands are "bards", gun-slinging outlaws that were the popular target of movies by Ancient British film-makers. They inspired the modern American [[Gay_boys|Cowboy]].

The Welsh also love [[football|rugby]], but only because it's the closest thing to [[war]].  And you can hug [[men]] in very tight shorts.

==Religion==
The Welsh believe they have strong roots to the indigenous [[Celtic]] people who inhabited their country [[At_least_100_years_ago|a long time ago]] and therefore mostly profess [[Paganism]], in which they worship the great sheep god and talk in a stupid voice. They avoid [[Christianity]] due to it being the official religion of [[England]].  This is the typical fallacious [[potato fucking|Celtophilic]] bullshit because the indigenous Celts were converted to Christianity hundreds of years before the English.  Whales' co-official [[religion]]s are the Church in Wales (Anglican Christianity) and Hinduism due to the high population of immigrant [[India]]ns.

==Animal husbandry==
[[Image:Welsh.jpg|right|thumb|What the [[fag|welsh]] fap off to]]

Many people in whales are allegedly the descendants of sheep. This is widely known due to the many cases of sheep shagging seen by tourists on unwitting trips to this wasteland. Their harsh language is also slightly accredited to this as sheep aren't accustomed to speaking English. The Welsh argue that there are a number of advantages to sheep shagging, including:
*The wool provides good cushion for the pushin'
*Take them to edges of cliffs and they push back harder
*You don't have to make sure the sheep is 'pleasured' after you 'blow your load', though many Welshmen choose to [[ignore]] this.
*We shag them, you eat them.

On the downside, according to Welshmen, the growth in sheep shagging activity in the past few years has seen a 43% growth in recorded instances of 'Pooey Shlongs', which have left many a Welshman with a nasty taste in his mouth in the pub afterwards.

Wales is also home to the most stupidly named town in the history of the world. It is called [[tl;dr|Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogeryfingerlickingoodchwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch]], which translates to some mushy thing about churches and trees.

It is a well-known fact that whales have been subject to many attempts by the [[English]] to blow up the border and watch the country float off into the Atlantic, where it will sink. Offa's [[lesbian|Dyke]] was an early attempt at perforating the Welsh border so that the principality could be conveniently torn off.

This defensive [[strike]] was later repeated [[at least 100 years ago]] by the people from the Wirral who dug out a moat (or in Welsh, the Dee estuary). This reduced attacks on livestock so well that they then added another moat (Merci estuary, which was later bastardized to Mersey estuary by the illiterate Scousers of Liverpool). This lead to the old English proverb: ‘Safe as a [[sheep]] on the Wirral.’ Which by percentages is not very safe, especially if [[Alan Cox]] is around.


TL:DR


The English had a law stating (through about 7000 lines of bullshit) that if you steal an animal for food or whatever then you get Banhammered, but if you steal it for a sneaky one behind the sheds then that all right :). So while us Welsh were stealing every single sheep in England, you fucktards were just laughing believing that we were shagging them. This also explains why Wales is so full of sheeps. Yeah but whats funnier is you actually did end up shagging the sheep, we can handle losing some sheep, we can just take them by force from [[New Zealand]]

==Geography==
[[Image:WelshFlagUserBox.jpg|thumb|[[FYIAD|Flag]] of Wales]]
No one knows where the fuck Whales actually is, including the Welsh themselves. Some speculate it is accessible through a wardrobe in [[England]], but [[common sense]] dictates this is impossible because English people cannot afford enough clothes to own one. The EU has yet to acknowledge Whales' existence.

[[Furry|Furries]] regard this land as Heaven in their fucked up religion because it has a dragon on the flag, and the fact there any many mountains to [[rape|carry out sensual love-making]] to cute, cuddly animals [[fire|peacefully]]. This is because Wales is Communist and and as such, Welsh people are rather fond of fucking anything with fur or scales. However it is a misnomer that furries are worshiped as gods there as this is a temporary stage before the Welsh natives boil them alive and consume the corpse. Unlike the inhabitants of [[England|Aynglaynd]], [[Scotland|Scaahtlaynd]] and [[Ireland|Iairelaynd]], no Welsh person ever set foot in [[America]] so an American is likely to assume you are referring to a [[Rosie O'Donnell|large sea mammal]]. Whales are actually a type of fish.

==Education==
See Main Article: [[Shit|Education in Wales]]

Education in Whales purely consists of Rope Classes, [[Zoophilia|Sexual Education]] and [[Pedophilia|Kind, Loving Teachers]] and Sheep.  Education in Wales is about as equal to Water in Africa.  It's Non-Existant.  Ewe.

==Language==
Welsh is a dying language, despite what any patriots may insist. It is so close to extinction, bets have been taken. This is because:
#The vocabulary is too close to French for most people's comfort
#Speaking Welsh sounds like you have a throat full of phlegm and spit, which puts people off
#The only letters are l,d,w, and y
#It is mostly spoken by [[retards|patriotic Northern Welsh people]] and (of course),
#[[DO NOT WANT]].

Currently the Prince of Wales is forcing all students to devote five hours per week to this dead language. Refusal is met with a [[banhammer]].

Most Welsh speakers use English in everyday conversation, until a [[English|''Saes'']] comes within earshot - at which point they start swearing about the interloper in their native tongue. In contrast, most English-only speaking Welshmen try to fuck the nearest English or American person possible in the misguided hope of getting Jew and moving to a big mansion as far away from Wales as possible. To date, [[W|Catherine Zeta Jones]] is the only successful example.

The Welsh also have a nasty habit of putting two Ds on the end of everything ("everythingdd"), making it impossible to pronounce.  I have also found that, as everyone apparently knows, Welsh "dd" is pronounced ð.  How the fuck do you pronounce that? It's pronounced exactly the same as 'th' in English. Well, it's actually easier to pronounce than it looks. First, grow three extra pairs of vocal chords. Then, fill your throat with small fish. Now, try to pronounce the word. If you succeed, you'll sound like a freak with fish in their mouth: i.e., a Welshman.

The Welsh language was created [[at least 100 years ago]] by a French man named '''Hairmoanious Bosch'''. He took all of the unwanted parts of every other language (This is why there are not as many gerunds and participles) and stuck them together in a crude language that does not measure up to Whales' previous language, Turkish.

People from Wales are often confused with [[Pikeys]] due to similar behavior.

==Lady Diana, Princess of Whales==
[[File:Diana tits.jpg|thumb|left|Diana, Princess of Wales & Duchess of Chester]]
[[File:Camnchaz.jpg|thumb|His Royal Highness Charles, the current Prince of Wales with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]] 
[[Princess Diana]], was an [[attention whore]] with borderline personality disorder who continued shagging [[Arab|rag heads]] for the lulz, mostly to troll the (German) royal family. Who [[probably|dubious disclaimer]] murdered her before she could have Dodi Al-Fayed's baby, because having the next king of England's half brother as a Muslim is clearly not cricket.
Tony Blair called her "the people's princess" which is clearly shit as she was a descendant of James II. 

She was born in England, not Whales, which was a bit like Barbara Bush becoming Empress of Mexico. Which makes perfect sense as both the Bushes and <s>Winzors</s> Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburgs had dealings with the Nazis.

Ok, now pay attention, following Welsh history is [[serious business]], mainly because you cant read any of the names, and most of it is [[TL;DR]]

Llywelyn ap Gruffydd (as he was called in sheep tounge) was shagging Eleanor de Monfort(the daughter of Simon de Monfort, a rich bastard tried his hand at claiming the English throne). This was a fucking long way to drive just for a shag, but the matter was settled when he got her up the duff, and they had to make a sharp visit to Worcester Registry Office in 1278.

Eleanor died in childbirth (causing much [[lulz]] to Edward I), and the little girl, Gwenllian, therefore became the last true born Princess of Wales. Her Father was killed near Irfon Bridge on 11 December 1282, causing even more [[lulz]].

Edward I [[fail]]ed and couldn't bring himself to kill her, which was a pity, since he could have made the first [[snuff]] movie 600 years before anyone else AND not have been prosecuted for it, so he gave the baby to  Gilbert of Sempringham, a [[pedo]] monk who ran a monastery in the middle of nowhere. He paid Gilbert £20 a year to keep Gwenllian imprisoned till she died 52 years later. Hence the plan was

#Imprison Gwenllian
#Accept money of King
#[[????]]
#[[Profit!]]

proving once and for all that you CAN combine business and pleasure.

What has this to do the teh [[internets]]? Well you'll be entirely unsurprised that some obese [[basement dwelling]] Welsh  [[fucktard]] has created a web page for her [http://www.castlewales.com/gwen.html here], as if anyone is fucking bothered.
