==Tips For Sucky Consumers==
*xx_kitty_kat_xx: Attention Customers
**"Please don't ask me to do my job. If you do, you will be deemed a shitty customer and an overly-exaggerated story will be posted on an internet website and you will go down in history as a shitty customer. Thanks!"
*adrenalinecrazy: A Letter To My Customers
**"First off - our store hours are from 9:00AM to 9:00PM. When the sliding door does not open automatically when you walk or stand in front of them, it means we are closed. Do not try to pry the doors open. Do not try to peer inside our darkened store to see if you can see someone. If that's still not a big enough hint for you, kindly peel your face away from our window and look an inch below you; you'll see the store hours."
*leftyouparanoid: A Few Gripes From The Pet Store
**"See that sign that says "Employee's Only" on the door? It's not just a decoration. STOP FOLLOWING ME INTO THE BACK ROOM!!!!"
*[[Braumsgirl26]] has issues
**"Don't blame how god damn ugly you are on others who are better looking then you."
*ciccia15_31: [http://community.livejournal.com/customers_suck/24841729.html OMG AN OLD GUY TALKED TO ME]
**"him-'wow, i gotta tell you, this is the most contact i've had with someone of the opposite sex in as long as i can remember.' MY GOD i was just trying be polite and do the right thing and that's what i get in return. i certainly learned my lesson to mind my own business when i'm off the clock."
*MiniFoot: 
**'''Please don't follow little old ladies around and masturbate on them in the back of the yarn department.''' They WILL [[Jail|IRL banhammer]] you, even if you run to South America.

==I Came==

Rinnychan displaying her [[1337|1337]] janitorial skills, then bitching about it on LJ.

"I used to work at the place where [[Nigra|Obama]] wouldn't [[raep|fit in]].

Customer: I am a [[woman]]. It was my responsibility to take 60 seconds and clean up a little in the men's room. When you came in I apologized and said [[shit_nobody_cares_about|I would be out in about ten seconds]]. Instead of [[attention whore|acknowledging]] my presence, you proceeded to walk right by me and began peeing into the urinal.

I still refuse to believe that you were really that drunk at the time."  {{ljuser|rinnychan}}

==Moar Toilet Humor==

"I work in a really mundane, boring office building for a [[ED|very large company.]] 

[[Last Thursday|A few weeks ago]], in the woman's bathroom on my floor, [[Jimbo Wales|someone]] took a crap in the sink. Just...crapped in it and went on their [[gay|merry way]] I guess. So strange. It was a huge debacle with the bathroom being [[Pool's Closed|closed]] and [[retard|special people]] trained in cleaning [[Shit|human waste]] came in.

I just wonder why? I would [[Cho|KILL]] to know who [[Sex|did it]]. There are clients that come in to pick up packages and such, so [[Lie|I'm thinking]] it might have been a pissed off one."  {{ljuser|redandfuzzy}}
