'''Paul Douglas Valentine''' is the [[unwarranted self importance|self-proclaimed leader]] of [[Satanism]] and the owner/operator of the [http://www.churchofsatanicliberation.net/ Worldwide Church of Satanic Liberation]. The main statement on his website promotes his organization & Satanism with the following:

{{quote|the harmless Satanism of the 1980s that sparked needless fears of human sacrifice, child abuse, etc., has become a potentially very dangerous entity in the hands of a new breed of unabashed Nazis who flaunt their bigotry and hatred.|}}

==Media Claim to Fame==
In the [[1980s]] Paul Douglas Valentine wandered onto America's televisions in a feeble attempt to promote his cult and bring in [[Scientology]] level money.  Unfortunately for Paul it could have gone a bit better.

==Satanic Super Fail==

In the [[1990s]] Paul Valentine began to forever slide like [[shit]] down a hill toward [[epic fail]]. It could be because people got tired of his [[mental retardation]] & [[Zionist]] [[lies]]. Paul Valentine had begun to build up quite a reputation of being a [[stalker]], [[AIDS]] victim, drug addict, [[womanizer]], and [[furfag]]. He was known for claiming to have hundreds of [[kids]] & countless mistresses. He was also known for believing in real, actual demons & for practicing sex [[magick]]. It could also be that his sexual relations with dead Herman Slater was scandalous enough to forever ruin his public relations. Never mind why it happened because all that matters is that it did. Paul Valentine was then from that point on & still today is a Satanic has-been. From this time period on he is but a lowly [[cellar dweller]].

==Paul Valentine Converts to the Internets==
Paul Valentine began prostituting himself on [[YouTube]] & [[JewTube]] in order to separate the rubes from their money as well as so he could meet young men like the author of this article. The videos that he posts online generally are all about promoting [[addiction]] to [[beer]], [[bisexuality]], [[infidelity]], the [[white trash]] lifestyle, the [[assassination]] of Marilyn Manson, the [[rape]] of hillbillies, the [[lynching]] of religious folk, [[terrorism]] against [[vegans]], hot pockets, [[obesity]], [[suicide]], and all kinds of other faggotry.
