Inheritance
{{spoiler|BROM DIES! MURTAGH DIES BUT THEN DOESN'T DIE AND IS REALLY ERAGON'S BROTHER! BUT THEN HE'S NOT ERAGON'S BROTHER AND BROM WAS ERAGON'S FATHER}}
<br>
'''Inheritance''' is a [[crap]] fantasy book series written by hack writer [[CP|Christopher Paolini]]. The series has sold [[over 9000]] copies and caused everyone and their [[Your mom|moms]] to declare Paolini a prodigy, because apparently he wrote it when he was [[13-year-old boy|15 years old]]. Of course, if you do any research on the subject, you'll quickly learn that young Christopher only ''started'' writing Eragon, the first brick in this series, when he was 15, and everyone has simply gotten confused because of Knopf's Jew marketing [[lies]]. He was actually nineteen when he finally finished the damn thing, giving him plenty of time to perfect the art of [[plagiarism]].What is even more obvious is the sole reason it got published is because his family owns a fucking publishing company. Anyone with a brain can figure out pretty quickly that Paolini just took the plot outline from [[Star Wars]], removed all the nouns, and replaced them with slightly altered [[shit]] from [[Lord of the Rings]], meanwhile the dragons are directly ripped off from Dragonriders of Pern. Much like [[Twilight]], Inheritance is a series that [[fails]] on a million levels, yet is inexplicably adored by thousands of [[retarded]] fans the world over. Look at it this way: Eragon is to literature what [[Naruto]] is to [[Ramen]].

__TOC__


== Eragon == 

[[Image:Eragon_book_cover.png|thumb|The cover is about the most well done part of this brick.]]

[[Eragon]] is a whiny [[13-year-old boy|fifteen-year-old farm boy]] who discovers a magic rock while out hunting one day. The rock hatches into a [[FYIAD|dragon]], and so an [[Lemonparty|old man]] named Brom decides through unspoken consent to take him to go join the Varden, a group of [[Islam|terrorists]]. Eragon's uncle Garrow gets [[pwnt]], pissing him off and making him swear vengeance. He travels across the land, joining forces with a [[Emo|daring rogue]] named Murtagh by unspoken consent, rescuing a [[whore|beautiful princess]] from the [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|evil empire]], and [[Star Wars|learning how to master the supernatural powers and discipline of a nearly extinct group of warriors who once protected the land before the evil empire killed them all]]. Also, Brom [[Dying Alone|dies]]. In the end, Eragon and his [[penis|dragon]] join the terrorists by unspoken consent and fight a great battle that ends in [[fail|victory]] for the Varden (but not the readers, unfortunately).

== Eldest ==

Eragon heads to the woods to meet up with some elves and learn more magic. The elves love to brag about how they are at least [[at least 100|10]] times more powerful than humans, but mentally they are hand-picked to be the epitome of [[hippy]] weeniness. They never leave their woods to get shit done (they just complain to wanderers), nor do they [[sex|breed]] [[Cunnilingus|or eat meat]]. Eragon is forced to become an elf-human, because [[fyiad|dragons]] prefer the image of unused potential and pansiness. Meanwhile, his cousin Roran finally manages to [[sex|get some]], before his pussy is kidnapped. By unspoken consent, he convinces an entire village of people to abandon their homes and go on a perilous journey down the coastline so he can ask Eragon for help in saving his only source of poon. Eragon then fights another great battle, where he learns that [[Spoiler|Murtagh is both a traitor and his brother]].

If that description seemed shorter to you than the one for Eragon, that's because Eldest, despite being a longer book, actually manages to say less than its predecessor, making it an amazing example of [[tl;dr]].

== Brisingr ==

[[Image:Brisingr_book_cover.png|thumb|I wonder if the last book will have a dragon on the cover too?]]

The last book in the Inheritance Trilogy is...wait. Fuck. Paolini actually made the third book so damn big that it couldn't fit in one brick, so he split it into two. Now there will be even more of this [[crap]] clogging up bookshelves and draining the pockets of worshiping [[retarded|simpletons]].

Going hand-in-hand with the fact that the book is the result of Paolini's habit of [[fapping|writing]] like his pen was his [[penis|dick]], the book is almost entirely filler. However, the book is notable for introducing [[furries]] to the world of Alagaesia, so expect an ungodly amount of [[yiff]] to start appearing in droves of poorly written Eragon fanfiction already out there. Oh, except for the [[gay|naked male/horned male oil wrestling for an utterly contrived reason]] proving once and for all the series is nothing more than an [[tl;dr|overly long]] [[Twilight|wet dream that beats out the competition]] for faggiest fiction around. By unspoken consent.

== The Future ==

Whenever the green brick comes out, expect it to rip off Return of the Jedi as bad as [[Truth|Eragon ripped off A New Hope and Eldest ripped off The Empire Strikes Back]]. Of course, [[fucktard|George Lucas]] is so fucking [[fat|rich]] he doesn't even need to [[Lawsuit|sue]] Paolini's ass. Oh, if only.

Really though, you can probably expect the last ever green dragon to hatch to the aforementioned [[whore|beautiful princess]], the super-evil-I-swear King to discover the name of Magic, for farm-boy-turned-Jedi to have steamy PG sex with steamy PG elf chick and to leave to find a better place with her after defeating the big bad guys by using a previously unfound stash of dragon hearts in the Vault of Deus Ex Machinas that every body can vaguely remember. Paolini is a [[Sarcasm|master of foreshadowing]].

== The Movie ==

Like any bestselling piece of [[shit]], Eragon was turned into an equally shitty movie. It was so bad that even die hard [[fag|fans]] of the book hated it, but for all the wrong reasons. Instead of hating it for being based on a [[Truth|terrible]] book, they hated it for making changes to a [[fact|terrible]] book. 

{{quote|Godawful, just godawful, like beyond bad. Toilet water I would rather drink, in long slow gulps, than watch this again.|Anonymous}}
{{quote|Personally, I think this movie topped lord of the rings. [[lies|It's not nearly as cliche]] and includes more fantasy. At least the main character isn't as hopelessly [[gay|helpless]] and frodo was.|Retard}}
{{quote|TERRIBLE!!! It has nothing to do with the book except for the names of the characters and [[BitingBeaver|throws the plot out the window!]] Tthe dialogue was cheesy, the directing terrible. The only possitive point was the way the [[cock|dragon]] looked. All in all a terrible movie that deserves to be [[rape|toasted]] by the [[penis|dragon]], if I was Christopher Poalini I would [[an hero|commit suicide]] for having my book portrayed in that matter!|Inheritard, not realizing that Paolini should [[an hero]] for writing the book in the first place}}

== The Fans ==

Visit any Inheritance related forum and you'll quickly learn that Inheritards are the male equivalents of the [[16-year-old girls|sixteen-year-old girls]] who primarily make up the [[Twilight]] fanbase. They are often idiotic, irrational, obsessed to the point of making death threats, and they type like [[Michael J. Fox]]. They are also have a chronic obsession with [[raep]] of all shapes and sizes, and want for every character in the book to [[raep]] people so it can be [[sick fuck|interesting]]

[[Image:Menloverape.png|thumb|left|Men are ebil because they want to rape wimminz!1!]][[Image:Womenloverape.png|thumb|It's not violent rape, okai? It's "forced mating"!!!]][[Image:MOAR (2).png|thumb|left|Don't let your morals get in the way of my OTP!!!]][[Image:Mindrape.png|thumb|The bad guy could just rape her with his mind... That would get rid of all the bloody mess!]][[Image:Draconicassault.png|thumb|Give me MOAR hawt non-con dragon pr0n!!]]

== Now What? == 

Now that you have read the books, and watched the godawful movie, the only thing to do would be to buy all kinds of paraphernalia, and brag to your friends (I'm sure they will enjoy that). Sadly if you have done this, the only thing for you to do now is an hero. But make sure you did it for something Inheritance related.
