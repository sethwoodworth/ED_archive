<font size=5>Greetings ED faaayns, spax's page here.</font>

'''Spax3''' ([[Powerword]]: Alexander/Edison Prins-Stairs) is a batshit insane tartlet, vidya gaem expert and child of e-law who has successfully entered the hall of infamous losers for his poor attempts at journalism, [[Butthurt|reaction]] to opposing viewpoints and his nonexistent [[e]]-company. Spax, also known as Spack, Spaction3 and even the Hoodie,  was first brought to the attention to the normal half of the internet after he played a significant role in [[the Great Sonic-cide of 2007]], and boy howdy were they disturbed. Spax is perhaps the perfect representation of the typical Sonic the Hedgehog fanboy; an autistic fatty fatty uggo man-child who lives in his mom’s basement complaining about the new games yet still buys every version of said games.

{{quote|Uhm, is this- is this like a villain character, this Spax?|[[Chris-chan/Videos#Interviewed_by_Guru_Larry_of_ScrewAttack_Europe|Chris chan]]}}

==Who the fuck is this man?==
[[File:Spaction3_fursuit.jpg|thumb|Spax hiding his fuck-ugly face behind a [[fursuit]]. Yiff yiff.]]

Not much is known about Spax when he was physically a [[child]]. But what we do know is that Spax had his first [[boner]] by watching a commercial that advertised the very thing that has done a significant amount of contributions to spreading [[aids]] across the internet. That’s right; that very thing was a commercial for [[Sonic the Hedgehog]]. What was also known is that Spax won some shitty [[Pokémon]] card game tournament, dressed up as Mario enemy and was featured on a DVD cover and poorly made a drawing that appeared on a Sonic cartoon. Skip forward in time, Spax is no longer a child… physically. So what do you have now? You have an ugly basement dweller that complains about the new Sonic games yet still buys every version of said games, making [[No|EXCELLENT]] videos on how serious gaming is and voice acting.

Needless to say, Spax is completely lifeless and his world revolves around video games. [[OMG|Would it be a surprise that Spax is a virgin?]] Besides his [[Incest|mother and sister]], no woman would so even dare touch his unwashed skin let alone have his dirty cock should in any hole. As a result of having no woman having any desires of having Spax, he looks for romance within cartoon characters. That character would be [[Cream]] the rabbit from the Sonic series. According to her bio, Cream is actually [[Loli|six years old]]. Additionally, he often mispronounces her name as “Creab”. But don’t think that she’s the only one on his “to stalk” list. Oh no, it seems that Spax has his own internet girlfriend. His “girlfriend”, {{deviantart|julayla|Julayla}}, is another Sonic fantard who makes awful fanfiction and MS paint art. It is also rumoured that she has even dressed up as Creab Duh Rabbit for Spax.

Other people in his life have also helped mold Spax into the being he is. His mom is purportedly a [[lawyer]] according to Spax himself as he has often claimed that she will be his attorney within his [[lawsuit]] threats. He uses his mother as a shield in order to take down anything that offends him. However, after seeing his house and is condition in various videos it is highly unlikely for his mother to be a lawyer. If anything, she would be a legal aid at best.

===Video Game Journalism===
[[File:Spax_Sonic_Next_Gen.PNG|thumb|Spax hates Sonic Next Gen so much he bought both versions of the game. Ha! Take that Sega!]]
Here is where the shitstorm started; his video game journalism. Like everyone else, Spax was heavily inspired by the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]]. In every review he goes through every microscopic detail possible which makes the video last more than ten fucking minutes. Most reviews are half of that time only because they actually try to not bore their audience. 

Surprisingly enough, Spax has actually built up his own [[fanbase]], and god damn are they fucked up. They were even given a [[forum]] by their great god so that they can constantly give Spax compliment sandwiches, discuss about what he should review next and, to a higher extent, talk about their fantasies of sucking Sonic’s cock.

His reviews all start with an unnecessary ESRB rating since he is imitating the [[AVGN|Nerd]] after all. Then comes in the chopped up [[TV|Cartoon Network]] logo with his poorly made (like everything else) acronym inserted. No copyright infringement here, folks. After that, you get stared down by [[Ugly|Spax’s face]] with horrible music playing in the background. My, what fantastic quality of work we have here, huh?

Spax is known for bitching at the following:
*'''VOICE ACTING'''
*The lighting of a spring in a 2D Sonic game. ([http://www.spaxgametoonzone.net/CNASN_Season_1.html I shit you not])
*Commenting on how it defies reality even though it's a fucking game.
*Commenting on how the story does not make sense.
*Saying that little tidbits completely ruined the Sonic series.

===Spax vs. 4kids===
[[File:SpaxPosterIRL.jpg|thumb|left|DOWN WITH 4KIDS!]]

Like every weeaboo on the butternets, Spax hates anime dubbing with a burning hatred. And which dubbing company is hated the most by weeaboos? That company would be the one and only [[4kids]], known for giving their characters [[Jawsus|inappropriate voices]], out of character statements and ill names. After Ryan Drummond retired as the voice actor of Sonic, Spax [[BAWWW|cried]] his eyes out over the loss of a super amazing actor with the voice of a million angels. Oh lord what a loss! Afterward, Jason Griffith took over as the voice of Sonic and started with the notoriously bad game, Sonic 2006. After playing said game, Spax’s boner died and he began his rage. His most infamous rage was his review of Sonic 2006.

In this review he complains about every single thing he could possibly find. However, the part that Spax has criticized the most was none other than the voice acting. He believes that something like voice acting completely changes the character and makes them repelling. Of course, Spax has the wetdream of a thirteen year old boy. He dreams to be the voice actor of his favorite character and be adored by millions. But what makes this completely lolful is that Spax is in his fucking 20’s.

{{squote|One personal thing that pissed me off is that Ryan Drummond and David Humphrey 2 of the FEW top notch actors of the original cast, were replaced by this... THING THAT JUST, FUCKED UP WHO SONIC'S CHARACTER IS! AND I'M NEVER GONNA LET IT GO! Not until he's replaced! I don't care if it's Ryan and David who return... as just as long as it's someone who's NOT GRIFFITH!!!}}

After Spax has emailed '''GRIFFITH!!!''' regarding his voice acting. As a response, Spax received a very nasty poo email to his [[Retard|(very stupid)]] questions. This hurt Spax’s oh-so-sensitive feelings and later on that day he vowed to destroy '''GRIFFITH!!!''' In order to destroy Griffith’s life, Spax decided to serve him through voice acting and [[USI|show how Sonic SHOULD be voiced]]. [http://www.megaupload.com/?d=PHAYF0WX Click here if you want to waste precious space for the lovely voice acting of Spax]. After this video was posted something magical happened! Jason Griffith’s life was completely unchanged.

However this [[Shit nobody cares about|nonexistant]] war between the two has ended after Spax has apologized in his Sonic Unleashed review. Or so it seems…

[[File:Bigal_has_mantits.jpg|thumb|[[YouTube_Nobodies#BigAl2k6|One of Spax's enemies]].]]
{{quote|If I'm gonna sue someone, I'll sue an adult...|Spax3}}
The earliest and most famous moment when Spax pulled the [[bullshit]] straight out of his ass was when he was fired from a Sonic movie project in which he was going to voice none other than Sonic himself. Of course since this project had enough [[loser]]s, they couldn’t make room for Spax’s fat ass. After getting [[Jacknstock|lol fired]], he threatened to fucking sue the [[Sonmanic|director of the project]] if he didn’t shut down the project, which he did later on. After this, a thirteen year old girl who was also involved with the project made a video about WHY Spax was actually fired. Basically, all he did was sat around, [[LOL|playing his Barney video game]] and watching anime. He was making absolutely no contributions, or in other words, just being himself.

After the discovery of this video, '''Spax has gotten his own mother to talk to the girl about the video and even told her that it can get her sued'''. However, most have called this bullshit since:
*It was merely outlining why he was fired. Meaning this is was in the form of commentary/criticism; and both are protected under the law.
*It has nothing harassing within it.
*No legal threats were made.
*There is no fucking way that his mother is a lawyer. [[Media:Spacks_eLawyer_Mansion.jpg|Take a look at Spax's "mansion".]]
**Spax's mom is only breastfeeding him in this case.

This then caused a riot on YouTube and in no time a number of [[YouTube Nobodies]] began making commentaries on this along with his game reviews.

With so many [[tube]]rz making commentaries on his videos, Spax has had enough. He showed his revenge by using his nonexistent company, [[Nothing|Mighty Noid Entertainment]], to take down videos as a violation of copyright. But what he doesn’t realize is that none- NONE of the videos he has taken down even violated copyright law. In fact, commentaries, parodies and criticism, the three things Spax has taken down, are protected under law by fair use. In other words, Spax has no idea how the fucking law works. Additionally, it is highly doubtful that Spax has legally registered the names “Spax3”, “CNASN Game Reviews” and “Mighty Noid Entertainment” in order to have legitimate copyrights on those titles.

==Videos==

===By Spax himself===

After seeing all the [[Jewtube|Jewtubers]] make countless parodies, commentaries, and criticism videos about him, Spack had finally had it. From what, one can tell, it seems he decided to strike back at all the trolls, by doing what he thinks to be epic trolling - making shitty Skype discussions about Burger King giving him a boner, etc. It gets better though: He does this, with some underaged kids, who like to pretend like they get boobs all the time.
 
This, apparently has lead to the creation of a "[[Original_character|character]]", [[sarcasm|hilariously]] named Hoodie Drunkito. You see, Spax thinks that just naming something mexican, makes him a hilarious bastard (he also wears a mexican hat thing, later on). Now, he's also making some shitty series for making fun of some stupid faggot who nobody cares about.

One could debate for hours, on the purpose of these videos: Spax trying to troll, Spax trying to be funny, Spax trying to accomplish epic win. But the fact stays: whichever one of those may be the case, he fails at either one of them.

===Spax at E3===

At E3 2010, Spax hunted down James Rolfe (aka AVGN) and conducted the most brilliant interview known to mankind... actually, it featured the most generic questions you could ever think of and, as a result, is the most mind-numbingly boring "interview" you are ever likely to see. Spax attempts to boost his own ego at several points, most notably when he mentions his own shitty Transformers review and tries to takes credit for the existence of James' own review. Because without Spax, video game reviews just wouldn't exist. 

NOTE: This video was originally reuploaded to Viddler, but was since taken down by either Spax3 himself or one of his GAYMERR FANS. We are now linking directly to Spax's video on Blip. What are you gonna do now; take down your OWN VIDEO?! HAHAHAHA. No, seriously.
