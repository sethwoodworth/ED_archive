'''Hey Dad..!''' was an Australian [[Childlove]] series produced by [[NAMBLA]], originally airing from 1987 to 1994 on the Seven Network and [[12chan]]. In March [[2010]] the beloved former child star and daughter in the program Sarah Monahan came forward in an [http://womansday.ninemsn.com.au/celebrityheadlines/1026162/hey-dad-sex-scandal interview with Woman's Day magazine] and told how she was repeatedly molested by her on screen ''Dad''. This inspired a series of [http://qcl.farmonline.com.au/news/metro/national/general/new-claims-against-hey-dad-actor/1787181.aspx women he had molested] to come forward and most of the former cast to admit that he was a certified kiddyfiddler.

==Synopsis==
Hey Dad..! is set in the small Sydney suburb of Chatswood, where Martin Kelly has ass-tearing [[buttsecks]] with his [[incest|daughter]] and every other child to make a a guest appearance.  After watching ''[[To Catch a Predator]]'' their mother Margaret suddenly died of a heart attack, and left a will for Martin announcing she wants him to fuck their children. 

Martin would run his child pornography ring in the bottom of their basement, and called himself an [[Pedophile|Architect]] for tax purposes. Most episodes would center around the children dealing with their incest issues. Once the children grew up, the show would kill them off and replace them with Aboriginals. For more information on the outcome of this, read the Government report [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Children_are_Sacred ''Little Children are Sacred'']
