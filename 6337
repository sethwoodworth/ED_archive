'''Pennsyltucky''' is best described as [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]] with 46,000 square miles of [[Kentucky]] in-between. Pennsylvania was once known [[shit nobody cares about|for its large oil reserves, steel mills and famous sports teams]]; since 1980, these items no longer exist in Pennsylvania and it's now known for being the place where people from [[New Jersey]] go to clear that state's poison gas from their lungs.  In fact, Pennsylvania is similar to New Jersey, though the populace is somehow far worse and there's even less to do.

==[[Alcohol]]==
Pennsylvania is noteworthy for its [[fucktard]]ed, archaic liquor laws, as the state has a monopoly on wine and hard liquor sales. If you find yourself in Pennsylvania (in which case you will require booze to put up with being surrounded by cow-tipping [[Klan]]smen), you have to go to a state store to buy either of those things (or a winery, or one of the state's rare outlets for wine). However, you will not be able to get beer. If you want beer, you have to go to a beer distributor. But you'll only be able to buy 24-packs. If you want to buy a six-pack, you have to find an open bar, which will [[rape]] you for the cost. Sometimes pizza places carry forties. I don't know why. You will '''not''' find alcohol in gas stations or grocery stores, because unlike '''normal''' states, Pennsylvania is mentally [[retarded]].

You will only be able to buy what the state has chosen to sell, and [[lie|interestingly]], the good shit like 190 proof Everclear is just [[illegal]].

The system is supposedly a good thing in that the state buys an assload of alcohol and passes discounts down to you, but that is immediately negated by the fact that the liquor tax is '''[[at least 100|18]]%''' which adds up real fucking quick.

Pennsylvania has a bit in common with [[Canada]] in that most of its population lives near its borders, so they can spend their money on booze in a neighboring state with more relaxed laws.  The Pennsylvania legislature are such huge [[fucktards]] that they either don't notice this, or it's a plot to keep the citizens away from Harrisburg--the centrally located state capital.

==Sightseeing in PA==
PA is home to:
* Abandoned steel mills, though they are being demolished in favor of strip malls.
* [[Irony|Fluorescent light signs advertising Amish communities]].
* Climax, PA; not to be confused with [[sex|Intercourse]], PA or [[masturbation|Bird-In-Hand]], PA, both of which are the opposite of [[Pain series|Blue Ball]], PA.
* [[Wikipedia:Centralia, PA|Coal mine fires that nobody bothered to put out.]]
* Orange construction barrels and "ROAD WORK AHEAD" signs from March to December.
* Road signs that haven't been updated since the Pirates were a good [[baseball]] team.
* A full and rich array of different [[goatse|potholes]], some large enough to swallow yachts.
* Endless coal mines, open [[shaft]]s and vents.
* McKeesport - record holding ghetto of the "First double-homicide of 2008" and "First Vehicular Manslaughter of 2009" awards.
* PENNDOT - the largest government troll organization, known for its inability to recognize its own documents.
* Rotting rural trailer parks full of northerners who proudly fly the [[Confederate]] flag.

== The Lehigh Valley Area ==
[[At least 100 years ago]], the Lehigh Valley area was semi-rural and filled with nice and friendly human beings. For some reason (after [[9/11]]), [[goatse|New Yorkers]], [[goatse|Jerseyites]], and black person flooded the area. They built large developments and overcrowded the schools. This led to massive increases in property taxes to pay for school budgets, which pissed off all of the native residents. The crime rate went from about 0.001 to [[over 9000]]. Scranton (home to the show The Office and pretend home of [[Joe Biden]]) is also in this area.
