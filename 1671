College

[[Image:College really isn't necessary.jpg|thumb|right|"College really isn't necessary," as explained in this unintentionally hilarious piece. PROTIP: It was written by a [[16 year old girl|high school student]]]]
So, you're now [[Barely legal|18]] years and will be graduating [[school|high school]] soon, and are unsure what to do with your life. There's only one choice for you: [[RAGE|COLLEGE!]] Yes, college.  Because as everyone knows, unless [[you]] go to college you will wind up unemployed and homeless. [[exaggeration|Without college, you cannot possibly hope to accomplish anything in your life.]] 
   
Colleges/Universities are famous theme parks where rich [[Jews]], [[White]]s, and [[Azn]]s pay about $80,000-$120,000 [[money|Jewgolds]] in order to get [[unwarranted self importance|that special Master's Degree or Doctor's degree]] so they can set out and [[nothing|change the world]]!  Occasionally, one will come across a [[black]] or [[Mexican]] college student.  However, these students are only attending school on athletic scholarships, and [[Statistics|99%]] of them will fail out or fail to go professional and be reduced to dealing drugs. Overly [http://www.triplestarnews.com/images/college/collegegirls/types.html social white girls] will go to college to whore themselves in an effort to try to win approval of their peers and become true beer sluts.

PROTIP: You gotta take the fucking [[ACT]]/[[SAT]] first.

== College Students ==
[[Image:TeacherStudentGayBlowJob.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Typical male student-teacher relationship.]]
For the most part, college is really just a place where kids want to have sex and do drugs. This is probably because they never got the chance [[LINK MAH BOIIIII|to bomb some vagoo in high school]]. Many of these aforementioned college students join a [[shit|college band]] to [[Oxymoron|greater increase]] their chance of scoring anal penetration with their illustrious [[loli|jail bait]].

[[Typical|Typically]], college students are some of the most ignorant and shallow people on the fucking planet. Despite supposedly coming to school to learn, most college students are there to get [[AIDS|STDs]] and become pregnant so they can sell their [[STD|syphilis]] infested black person baby to the black market to pay for the 100 grand in student loans they owe because they chose to go to a private school like Harvard.  Little do most students know that [[Niglet|babies with AIDS]] go for just a little [[over 9000]] on the black market, still leaving them with staggering debt only cured by becoming [[an hero]] or starting a porn site where you give blowjobs to children with Down Syndrome while you [[shitting dick nipples|shit out your nipples]], since that is basically what everyone on the interwebs wants to see.

College students possess the "unique" trait of thinking that they will be able to do something productive with their lives.  However, we all know that [[at least 100]] out of 100 college students in this country are destined to get in line to suck Ronald McDonald's epic clown cock for the rest of their lives ([[srsly]], what else did you think you were going to do with that Bachelor's degree in [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|philosophy]]?)

===Typical College Student===
[[Image:Hot-college-girl.jpg|thumb|right|150px|What a [[hott|hawt]] girl looks like before college.]]

[[Image:4_Obese_fatties.jpg|thumb|right|150px|What girls look like after coming to college.]]

99% of college students will be smug, [[Bisexual|bi-curious]], [[Democrat|left-wing]], [[Vegetarian|vegetarian]] [[Hippy|hippies]] who listen to shitty, pretentious, [[Indie]] [[music|bands]], use [[Mac]]s, do drugs, drink too much at parties in an attempt to look cool, major in [[philosophy]] or [[Nazi|German]] history, and have [[Unwarranted Self Importance|unwarranted senses of self-importance]]. Or they can be [[Republican]]s. 

The other 1% includes the makers of [[Google]], [[Moot]], and other makers of the [[internets]]. They also include [[W|almost]] all Presidents. You'll probably end working for one of these study-[[fetish]]ists.

=== Freshman 15 ===

The "Freshman 15" refers to the tendency of college students to put on weight in the freshman year thanks to all the free food. [[shoop da whoop|Lazers]] from unknown sources are fired at hot, nubile, bangable chicks when they enter college that turn them into massive [[Cockmongler|cockmonglers]] of truly epic proportions at the end of the [[newfag|freshman]] year.

== Art ==

A career that most rich [[white people|whiteys]] living in the west coast take in order to "reinvent" the world of art. Kids who take a career in art find that spending a fortune for a couple of classes a year is a lot better than spending a couple bucks for a few instructional books, paint, art pencils, and some sketch books to draw their great [[DeviantArt|masterpieces]]! 

== Death of "Talking" ==

Colleges students enjoy the thrills of the [[Internets|internets]] (read: not getting laid) and spend the majority of their time "talking" on instant messengers and "poking" people that would never [[EVAR]] sex them on [[facebook]]. This amount of social interaction has left them with chafed and bleeding penises from fapping too much to [[baby rape]] and anthro [[guro]]. Today's college students maintain a strict code of complete silence while in class. Contribution of any kind to class discussion is taboo; it's preferable to let the silence spin out for at least five minutes rather than answer when the prof asks for the definition of "plagiarism". Once class is over and the paralyzing fear of answering a question wrong in class has safely passed, college students are free to spend their pent-up communication skills running through their dorms drunk, naked and screaming as T-Pain blares from their roomate's Mac.

== The Ugly Truth About College ==

The vast majority of four-year college graduates (except those going on to science, engineering, and law degrees, as well as those pursuing careers in [[prostitution|hot gay sex]]) will earn less over their working lifetimes than someone who spent 1/4 the time and 1/4 the money getting an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) certificate. That's right â€” ''the Mexican guy who fixes your A/C makes more than you, college boy, and has no student loans to pay off!'' LOL
