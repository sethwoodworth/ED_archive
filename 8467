'''Tonetta''' is a lo-fi musician from [[Canada|Toronto]].  His band, ''Tonetta'' performs his songs - without him.  His lip-synching performance in his videos give the appearance that he doesn't know his own lyrics.  By all appearances, he's as [[Tom Cruise|gay as the day is long]], but claims to be straight.  Nearly all his songs are about fucking.  Welcome to the world of Tonetta.

==YouTube==
Like all good artists, he has suffered repeated [[b&|bannings]] at the hands of the JewTube Decency Protocol enforcers.  Tonetta, like any good troll, just makes a new account and keeps rolling on.

==Quotes==
{{morphquote|tonettaquote|background-color:white;|font-weight: bold;|I don’t listen to music. I don’t listen to the radio, I don’t watch TV. I don’t do any of those things. I kind of keep to myself, I’m more of a recluse, and I think my music is different for that reason.|Tonetta|I’ve been called so many things on YouTube, queer, fag. But I’m not, and that’s the crazy thing about it. They actually think I’m gay. I’ve got two boys and I was married. If I meet the right girl, I’ll get married again. I like pussy. If I have the choice, I’ll take tits. I like the female body. I’ve never been with guys.|Tonetta, sounding like a Republican}}
