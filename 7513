'''''Silkroad Online''''' is an [[MMORPG]] that is based on [[Truth|true]] events in which [[China]] traded to [[Europe]] using the Silkroad [[Shit nobody cares about|that connected the two continents]]. But it seems that we as the [[Fail|well]] edumacated people, were left in the dark as to what people back then were really like. Apparently, some [[Boi|chicks]] can float, some are [[Furry|furries]], all held massive irrelevant weapons, and everyone can turn into a raging, red, [[Pedophilia|pedo]], [[buttsecks]] demon used to [[rape]] small [[Furry|animals]] with their [[XBox|HUEG]] boners. This game has been fucked over by [[IRL|real]] money traders so epically that it threatens to [[Divide by zero|tear time and space apart,]] where all of us would be tossed into a world of [[Nigra|Nigras]], [[Furry|furries]], [[Brian Peppers]], and computers totally devoid of [[Pr0n|porn]]. But, for a totally free game, it is worth some [[lulz]], and is not the worst game on teh [[internets]].

== The truth about Silkroad ==
''Silkroad'' is not FREE and it never was. It's for those [[Gamer|people]] who are either too poor to buy a decent [[MMORPG]] or for the [[Cheese1997|mentally handicapped]]. You cannot get on the servers unless buys sild to get a premium ticket which is like a monthly subscription. Joymax [[Banhammer|bans]] bots they don't like so new and improved bots made by Joymax itself can take its place, forcing every [[13-year-old boy]] to [[Incest|milk their parents]] for money to buy [[shit|silk]]. Premium tickets are buyable via [[I came|silk]] which is buyable via [[IRL]] money. It's said it lasts for four weeks, but in reality, it lasts for three weeks and six days, thus stealing 24 hours worth of money from the [[Basement-dweller|players]]. [[fact|Neither GMs or admins care about players]] so don't expect to see any improvement. Since the game comes from [[Korea]], it features some amazing never before seen [[Engrish]] action that makes [[The Game]]'s story even better!

'''MAJOR UPDATE!''' According to almost-creditable [[sauce|source]], Joymax has been bought by a company related to Joymax. The following quote was on their official site, now deleted.
{{quote|Although this is an issue that could not be foreseen, Joymax is responsible for not being able to provide stable service to our users.|JoyMax [[pwnt|pwning]] itself?}}

Nobody really knows what the fuck happened here, but since then the bots are being banned every week, dropping the [[lulz]]/[[drama]] level of the game almost zero. (Some servers are always full providing some level of drama) I doesn't matter really, [[The Game|the game]] is still [[shit]].

Even that whomever wrote that has no [[Tits or GTFO|picture proof]] of this "joymax" claim, we can be sure to say ''Silkroad'' lies about many things. In the end, they will pay a lot of their little mistake.

== Silkroad online a Trojan virus? ==
One lovely day, all ''Silkroad'' [[Basement Dweller|players]] woke up to find out that their favorite [[slavery|game]] is recognized as a Trojan by AVG antivirus and removed some of the game's files, making it unplayable, causing [[drama]] across the [[internets|intertubes]]. Joymax became [[butthurt]] and told the players to [[Flame Wars|flame]] the company who made AVG because they didn't want the people know the [[truth]] about their game and they can't make money off of them. So every ''Silkroad'' [[fanboy]] (mostly the botters and all Turks) went on a [[Flame Wars|crusade]] against AVG, producing many [[lulz]] in the process.

== The truth according to Joymax ==
Back in the days of the silkroad, [[The Game|the people]] used [[magic]], glowed luminous colors, were sometimes monkeys, other times Mime monkeys, don't leik [[mudkipz]], and turned into the aforesaid demons of [[buttsecks]].

When in demon mode, you become [[Dick|larger]], grow [[Cock|horns]], glow red, and receive a massive [[Quasidan's penis|erection]] used to spray [[AIDS]] over unfathomable distances into a single [[Goatse|asshole]] of a [[Wapanese|weaboo]].

This also makes little boys a prime target on your minimap for aggravated [[rape]].

== Weapons ==
There are no classes in the game, it all goes by the weapon you are using; you could have all your skillz set on magic, and then pick up some axes and hack at shit just as fucking well.

===China===
*'''Glaive''' - A blade at the end of a stick.
*'''Spear''' - A pizzapan at the end of a [[dick]].
*'''Sword''' - A small [[Cock|blade]].
*'''Blade''' - A bigger [[Cock|blade]].
*'''Bow''' - Not a [[Cunt|blade]].

===Europe===
*'''Sword and Shield''' - Self-explanatory.
*'''2-Handed Sword''' - Once again...self-explanatory.
*'''Dual Axes''' - Probably one of the [[Pretty cool guy|coolest]] weapons in the game, you hold two axes and commence the [[pwn]].
*'''Staff''' - Used by the [[W|nukers]]. They [[Dying alone|die]] constantly and in an orderly fashion, on preset times decided by [[Moderator|Admin]] who like to [[I came|spawn hard]] [[That fucking cat|fucking monsters]] already very far up your own [[goatse|asshole]], resulting in a [[buttsecks]] implosion followed by [[nerd rage]].
*'''Crossbow''' - Usually used by [[nigras]] to make a fast getaway after stealing their Grandmother's welfare checks.
*'''Some sort of wand''' - Spews [[AIDS|happy magic]].
*'''Some other sort of wand''' - Shoots [[AIDS|cum]] into another [[Gamer|player]]s eyes, causing temporary blindness.
*'''Harp''' - Best weapon ever. Haven't ''you'' always wanted to kill with crappy [[Desu|chromatic scales]]? Think Tom Bombadil.

===SOS, SOM AND SUN===
Seal of Star, Seal of Moon, Seal of Sun, Seal of [[Penis]]. These are the weapon attributes that make every ''Silkroad'' player [[cum|cream themselves in joy]]. It's so rare that if you find it every player on the server will suck your [[cock]] for it. People sell these for shitloads of [[Jew Gold|gold]] and nobody can buy them unless they buy gold for the game. [[Pretty Cool Guy|Pretty cool]], huh?

== Jobs  ==
As said before, there are [[no]] classes, but once you get lvl [[Over 9000|20]], you get a whole [[I came|pair of pants]] tidbits that stay fun for about five minutes. First of all, once you're lvl 20, you are able to attack any other [[Basement Dweller|players]] [[Over 9000|over lvl 20]] for [[I did it for the lulz|no particular reason]], but be aware [[you]] will be wanted and have a bounty on your ass, [[Dying alone|thus leading to your imminent death by an extremely]] [[Crack|high]] level [[basement-dweller]] who masturbates to his [[Dick|glaive]] that he just used to give you [[AIDS]]. There are three jobs you can choose from after hitting that magic level 20!

*'''black person''' - Thieves are probably the [[one]] reason anyone keeps playing after the initial [[fail]] that is [[The Game|this game]], they look very [[fail|cool]], but [[Virgin|come up short]] in how well this job was integrated into the gameplay. (read trader)
*'''[[Pedophilia|Hunter]]''' - Hunters [[Luring|hunt]] thieves, and like to give much [[AIDS|pleasure]] to [[penis]].
*'''Jew''' - Traders are the Jews of the gamem they make all the [[Jew Gold|money]]. There are different [[Over 9000|levels]] of trade depending on how much [[Bullshit|cargo]] you are carrying, it ranges from [[You|1]] to 5 star trade. You can now get killed in a 1 star trade if you're [[Over 9000|over level 40]], so you're pretty much [[Pwn|fucked]], because every thief in existence will [[rape]] you in the ass, kill your family after they rape [[your mom]] and then [[nigga stole my bike|steal your goods]].

== Updates  ==
Now you can´t do any trades after lvl 40 without getting nuked by a fucking thief. 

You can kill people at a lower level and use a retard [[Lolcats|cat]], [[pig]], [[furry|bunny]], There are no black people on the Internet, [[Bitch|fairy]] to pick up [[Jew Gold|money]] dropped by your [[Lulz|victims]].

Joymax makes even more [[Jew gold|money]] by selling Fugly clothes which [[shit nobody cares about|adds some extra stats]]. Whoopie-fucking-do!

Fortress War! The first guild who got the fortress will [[Pwnt|own]] it forever because they are so [[god|fucking strong]] no one has a chance.

[[You]] can no longer have [[moar|more]] [[Desu|jobs]] than one, and without an über [[Dick|weapon]] [[Basement Dwellers|you shouldn't even bother getting a job]].
