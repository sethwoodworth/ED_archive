'''C. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bedford Bedford] Crenshaw''' is a [[redneck]] [[Wikipedia]] editor who enjoyed [[sysop|special privileges]] on the wiki for a few months in the year of [[2008]] before having them stripped away by none other than [[Jimbo Wales]] himself. Bedford is the very epitome of a [[holocaust denial|revisionist historian]]; he has created numerous articles on [[shit nobody cares about|national historic sites]] pertaining to the American Civil War, which he correctly insists on calling "The War of Northern Aggression"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2008-05-28_Bedford]. Bedford claims that he's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bedford/userboxes/User_Bachelor proud to be a bachelor], but he probably doesn't really have a choice in the matter as he's approaching 40-year old [[virgin]] status.

Like your typical [[Wikipedia admin]], he is overweight, ugly, short-sighted, nerdy and fast approaching [[old|middle age]], but nonetheless [[intelligent]], as he [[Citation needed|claims]] to have [[I have a 140 IQ|an IQ of 137]]. Like most geniuses, he has a tendency to sometimes [[asspie|misunderstand social situations]], be they [[OTI]] or [[IRL]], and he made a major [[you fail it|faux pas]] when he suggested a new hook for Wikipedia's ''Did you know''... section about a professional [[wrestling]] match.

Did you know...

==The Ensuing [[Drama]]==

This seemingly [[sick fuck|innocent]] addition managed to pass its way through Wikipedia's DYK section without anyone [[nobody cares|giving a shit]] about its supposedly [[sex]]ual nature, and indeed made its way to the Main Page, lurking there much more inconspicuously than had it been an act of [[Hagger|template vandalism]] like the ones that frequently hit many wikis. The DYK hook was only brought to the wider [[Wikipedo]] community's attention by an [[administrators' noticeboard]] post by, [[sarcasm|surprise surprise]], [[Sceptre]], [[seeking]] some [[attention]] as usual and perhaps looking to bolster his chances at a future RfA at the expense of others by [[BAWWWWW|pointing out Bedford's intolerance]].

Apparently, several "female" editors, including [[SlimVirgin]], [[Krimpet]], and Sarah had taken to removing it, and their white knight, '''Will <sup>(talk)</sup>''', had to come to their rescue and start an [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=228024282#Bedford_and_misogyny AN/I thread] bawwwing about the behavior of Bedford, whilst Sceptre was reveling in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page&oldid=227840827#Yay_women the attention he got] from [[no girls on the internet|female editors]] who lavished Will with praise for his Noble cause against [[baw|demeaning]] content on Wikipedia's front page.

{{quote|Don't mention it. The [[insane|less chauvinism, the better]]. It's a good thing that I found out about it, to be honest.|Sceptre on Sarah's [[talk page]], kissing ass like the sycophantic little prick that he is}}

Meanwhile, Bedford defended his own position, and why he caused an [[edit war]] on the main page of the English Wikipedia.

{{quote|It was [[censorship]] by a bunch of extremists.|Bedford showing that Wikipedia is not censored}}

Sceptre went on to [[flame war|retort]]:

{{quote|Don't accuse someone of censorship when they didn't even remove the hook. And please, put away the spade. [[internet tough guy|You're five miles deep in the lithosphere anyway]].|[[Typical]] behavior coming from Sceptre}}

{{quote|That is your own, [[ignorance|uninformed]], opinion. [[truth|Your actions have been a disgrace, and an embarrassment to Wikipedia]]. I'm so above you, I'm in the [[lol wut|Andromeda Galaxy]].|Bedford, talking down to a 17-year-old boy}}

Bedford then went on to accuse the [[offended]] women of being [[feminazi]]s (quite right too, [[lawl]]). He made a [[MySpace]] [http://www.webcitation.org/5ZaZbXmQh blog post] in which he gave these [[butthurt]] feminazi [[women]] a good [[attack|verbal]] [[rape|dressing down]], which just tipped the scales and induced [[nerd rage]] in the [[losers|Wikipedia community]]. At the end of the [[TL;DR]] administrators' noticeboard thread, the God-King [[Jimbo]] stepped in and took major action.

==Jimbo's Intervention==

{{quote|I have desysopped him. This is not even a close call. He's so far over the line of the [[shit nobody cares about|conduct]] - both onsite and offsite - that I expect from admins that nothing short of a full and complete apology for his behavior and a retraction of his comments will do. Additionally, he will have to stand for re-election if he dares. As for me, I would never vote for [[Essjay|someone with this kind of behavior in his history]].}}

{{quote|Based primarily on your myspace blog posting, but additionally based on your onsite behavior (and either would have been sufficient cause) I have removed your sysop bit. Such attitudes and behavior are absolutely unacceptable for a Wikipedia administrator. You can reapply either through me or the ArbCom. If coming through me, I can tell you that I will require a complete and total retraction of the comments you made, as well as a disavowal of the attitudes behind those, and even then I will not re-instate you directly but rather merely allow you to stand for re-election. The ArbCom may view things differently, and be more lenient. If so, I will not stand in their way.}}

The [[Wikipedia Review]] [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=19507 went crazy] with this tidbit of delicious drama, and a huge thread began with all aspects of this [[what|exciting story]] examined in detail. For starters, some [[women]] were not in the slightest bit offended by the hook and the "ladies" that were offended were from the wikichix mailing list, which Wikipedia Review had long been mocked by Wikipedia for claiming that wikichix would be filled with [[trap]]s just like Wikipedia.  And lo and behold for many of those from Wikichix (e.g. [[Krimpet]]) had been originally born male.

Wikipedia Review saw the actions of Sceptre and his [[losers|ilk]] as [[political correctness]] gone overboard, which is exactly what it is. On the other hand, other long-TOW-banned, WR regulars such as [[the fieryangel]] started bawwwwwing about how sexism was parallel to [[racism]] and was [[discrimination]] of the worst kind.  Just a note here: thefieryangel also is a trap, making it clear that only traps cared about this sexism and no real women actually did. Many were also quick to jump towards the [[fact]] that Jimbo has committed far greater [[holocaust|atrocities]] against women than this guy has. The Bomis [[porn]] search portal? [[Russia]]n [[hooker]]s paid for by [[Wikimedia Foundation]] cash? Making [[Rachel Marsden]] wash his semen-stained clothes? A great [[Ayn Rand|feminist thinker]] he is!

Aside from the debate about the content, various [[deep thinker|meta-questions]] were raised about this particular type of case. Was Jimbo's desysopping out of [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines|process]]? [[no|Does he have the right]] just to [[Ignore All Rules]] and act as the undisputed, unchallenged [[Final Boss]] of TOW whenever he feels like it? What right does Wikipedia have to [[police]] its editors' actions on other [[website]]s? Last time we all checked, [[Wikipedia:WP:NOT|Wikipedia is not]] the [[Internet Watch Foundation]] (although it may well [[Erik Moller|need investigation]] by them, [[lawl]]). Yet more proof that Wikipedia is a [[cult]], that restricts its members' right to free speech, a sense of [[lulz|humor]] and general [[gay|joviality]] that would be found on almost [[bebo|any other website]] on the [[internets]]. It also proves that by making an [[BFF|alliance]] with the feminazis, Jimbo is proving [[Conservapedia]] correct - six times more [[liberal]] than the [[American]] public, so they say - which brings us onto our [[serious business|next point]]. Why should Wikipedians be judged by liberal American standards of morality (which are pretty damned [[weird|anomalous]] compared to the average morality of the world as a whole)? As usual, Jimbo has no answer, because he [[fail|can't provide one]], and doesn't care as long as the [[old media]] or [[valleywag]] don't kick up a fuss about it.

There was talk of taking this case to [[Arbitration Committee|Arbcom]], and this has now [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#Bedford|taken place]]. The outcome of this is yet to be seen, but undoubtedly, it'll create moar juicy drama, which is always [[good]].

==In Conclusion==
Bedford, despite his [[fail|shortcomings]], is a [[pretty cool guy]] who we believe [[IDIFTL|did it for the lulz]]. [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] supports his resysopping, which also means that that will never happen. [[Lol]].

==Yes, that's right, they gave Adminship to THIS GUY==
In the following videos, Bedford does his best to live up to the antics of [[Chris-chan]] (there's a striking [[fat|physical]] [[ugly|resemblance]], too!)
