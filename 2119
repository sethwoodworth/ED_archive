{{ljcomm|dead_babies}} is a [[LiveJournal]] community dedicated to fucking hilarious humor. Found [http://www.livejournal.com/community/dead_babies/ here], you'll often encounter photos of abortions, miscarriages, and deformed children, as well as various gruesome accidents and images such as the [[pain series]]. It was created and is moderated by {{lj|shared_boxers}}, of [[Marriage is love]] fame.

Also [[Baby fuck|Baby Fucking]] is always alright, especially if they are dead.

This led to the phrase, "Your poison womb is making heaven too fucking crowded", which, while quite funny on its own, literally rewrites the comedy books in context: [http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=2538 viewable here].
