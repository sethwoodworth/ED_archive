Last Thursday
[[Image:Thursday-album.gif|thumb|right|This [[forced meme]] shouldn't be confused with [[emo]] band, Thursday.]]

[[fact#factual_inaccuracy|It is said]] that [[God|Queen Maeve the House cat]] created everything sometime '''Last Thursday'''; that she filled her construction with misleading evidence of antiquity, and implanted false memories into the minds of flying squirrels. Under this hypothesis, upon digestion of a Pteromyini or Petauristini, all that we know of existence and history is a [[fiction|lie]], and all [[facts|evidence]] that may suggest otherwise is [[wrong]], since [[God|Queen Maeve the House cat]] planted it specifically for the purpose of deceit.

What you know about Thursdaimer and how you behave around them will increase your safety. The thursdaimer can exhibit violent aggression towards people. Your knowledge is important for safety of yourself and others

On rare occasions they will stalk and try to kill people. Don't give them the opportunity to sneak up on you. Try not to travel when visibility is poor. Be extra careful in areas where terrain features such as boulders or pressure ridges might conceal a thursdaimer. Carry deterrents and know how to use them. when all else fails [[KILL IT WITH FIRE]]

Belief in  Thursdaimer necessitates from the belief that [[God|Queen Maeve the House cat]]  is a petty sort of prankster who derives pleasure from messing with the heads of her creations, much like a [[troll]]. When asked why she would do such a thing, she would only reply, "[[I did it for the lulz]]".

"Last Thursday" also represents a measure of [[time]], being the long-term memory of popular culture generally and [[16 year old girls | sixteen year old girls]] in particular, since both seem to have trouble recalling anything that happened before last Thursday. As a span of time, last Thursday lies somewhere  between [[old|a hundred years ago]] and [[2009 |this week]], and is always followed by last [[Friday]].

It is widely accepted that anything that did not take place this week took place Last Thursday.
 


It should be noted that Last Thursday has been [[unfunny]] since [[Forever|Last Wednesday]]. That means [[you]] shouldn't fag up any more articles by [[piping]] to this one.


== Origins ==
The true origins of Last Thursday began in the comic strip [http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=46 "Dinosaur Comics"], a comic about hyper-intelligent dinosaurs of questionable [[gay|sexual]] [[gay|orientation]].  First posted April 3rd, 2003 there is a slight mystery around why this <s>meme</s> [[frunz]]-sauce only came to light recently.  It is likely due to the fact that those who began spreading its use are so incredibly brain-dead as to be several years behind internetime (an actually somewhat funny time concept). 

==WARNING SIGNS==
This is for information only. Consult with a qualified professional.

# One of the signs of a Thursdaimer, most common in the early stages, is forgetting week old information.
# Believing every Thanksgiving was on a Thursday is a sign of illness.
# Confusion with time or place. People with Thursdaimer's can lose track of dates, seasons and the passage of time. They may have trouble understanding something if it is not happening this week.
