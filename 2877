Fat Acceptance Movement
{{potential}}

[[Image:BFB Health.PNG|thumb|center|600px|Most fat people have a morbid fear of the government brainwashing them with ideas of exercise and healthy eating.]]

[[Women]], [[black people]] and [[homosexuals]] all have major social advocates - they were oppressed because of who they were. Females cannot help being pussies on legs, blacks cannot help being subhuman, and faggots suck cock. Now, thanks to them we have [[feminazis]], [[Barack Obama|a nigger for a president]] and [[Chris Crocker]].

But it gets so much better - now people who intentionally turn themselves into gravy-guzzling tubs of blubber and waste money on surgery they don't need are demanding rights too.

For a clue as to what is making the fat people fat, go down the mall. Look around. Pick out the fat people. Now then: what are they all doing? Yep. That's what's causing it.

==Sizeism==
[[Image:Mrs Parker fatty.PNG|thumb|As it turns out the people most likely to become obese are [[holocaust]] victims.]]

When their mouths are not filled with food, [[fat]] people often complain that they are being discriminated against. [[Lies|The fat mentality]] is that it's OK to weigh a metric ton and that it's the skinny population's fault that being a gargantuan lardass is perceived as bad. '''Sizeism''' is supposedly a form of prejudice - believing that people are fat because they eat too much, in the same way that it's sexist to refer to a woman as "she".

[[Irony|Ironically]] fat people often complain that society is too obsessed with weight while bitching about how disgusting skinny or even healthy-sized people are in comparison to their own rolls of sweaty disgusting fat.


==NAAFA==
'''National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance''' is a group that hopes that one day all people will be accepted no matter what sizes they are. This includes people who weigh half a metric ton and have to be washed by their children three times a day while they wait for their gastric bypass surgery. Strangely [[some argue|some people]] see this as a bad thing.

However in order to combat prejudice they must prove that all thin people are prejudice. Those who count as thin include [[anorexia|anorexics]], bulimics, your dick or anyone within the normal weight range and those who weigh less than a John Deere tractor.

There are many misconceptions about fat people. NAAFA's guidelines will help you to dispel these myths:

Image:Fat FAQs 1.PNG|[[lie|FACT]]: ''It is literally impossible to lose weight.''
Image:Fat FAQs 2.PNG|[[lie|FACT]]: ''Educating people about their health never works. We must force others to accept us.''
Image:Fat FAQs 3.PNG|[[lie|FACT]]: ''Dieting is useless. The only solution is to eat more.''
Image:Fat Myths.PNG|[[lie|FACT]]: ''Fat people are not responsible for their weight.''
</gallery></center>

The above is prove to what [[mundanes|normal people]] have always believed - that excess fat stops the brain from working.


==NAFAM==

'''New American Fat Acceptance Movement is the next phase in fat acceptance. '''The days of justifying our fatness by lying and saying we have a mysterious genetic or metabolic disorder are over. We now freely admit to and embrace what the fat haters would call gluttony. We fatlings are no longer apologists for our size nor our greedy gluttony. We are fat because we eat huge amounts of food and we like it. If you don't like it get used to it because fat people are now the overwhelming majority. Gluttony is good. http://biggerfatterblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/obesity-and-gluttony-is-good-for-your.html Anything else would be unAmerican.'''

==SPECIAL MENTION: Wall • E==
[[Image:Fat Wall e Blog.PNG|thumb|300px|It's always thin people's fault. Remember that.]]

One of the most successful Disney / Pixar movies, Wall • E, showed a futuristic world where humans have become helpless blobs due to their [[Mecha dildo|dependency on machines]] and overindulgence. At the end of the movie the humans return to Earth, gradually becoming healthier and making the planet green again. Naturally the fatties had a problem with this.

{{squote|The real truth is that people just don't care that others are being discriminated against, as long as it's not directed their way. They don't - or won't - see how such stereotypes harm both fat and thin people, and contribute to an environment where a recent study of teen girls reveals they'd rather be blinded or lose a limb instead of becoming fat.|Strangely enough this person never actually saw the movie.}}

{{squote|omg you people it had nothing to do with her parents so you are saying that my mom had trouble with me and my brother? yes he got VERY big and unfortunately died :( but my mom fed us vegetables fruit and we were always outside! there is nothing you can do with some people!|YouTube user}}

This is a [[Lie]], and little Jessica Leonard (once the world's fattest child) is the proof:

[[You]] would hit that.

"You know, all parents make mistakes". Words just fail you, don't they?

==A Breakthrough in the Understanding of Obesity==
[[Image:ProForm-780-CSE-Elliptical-Trainer-297x300.jpg|thumb|150px|Not just an overpriced drying rack!]]

{{squote|Let's just say that yeah, it's a horrible thing that we're forcing you to take extreme measures to drop the gallons of blubber that you brought upon yourself, but could we be subconsciously doing you a favor? Would you rather spend the rest of your miserable ten or so years of life being wedged in small chairs that aren't meant to cater to your fat, pustulent ass, sucking down concentrated fat by the truckload until your arteries harden, absorbing wading-pools full of gravy through your vast amounts of skin, and praying to Jesus that it will someday rain melted butter before you're forklifted out of your house through the removed front wall onto three stretchers, and riding an ambulance on its axles to a hospital where they can't give you that dire quadruple bypass because there's too much goddamned adipose tissue for any normal human being's arms to even reach through even if he could find your bloated, flabby heart?

Here's your incentive, fatasses. Drop the fork and get on the treadmill. Stop kidding yourself into thinking it's OUR fault that you're a repulsive sack of fat. It's your fault that you decided it proper to waste your entire 20 years of life dedicating yourself to wrecking your body and our eyesight.
