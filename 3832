'''I'm 12 years old and what is this?''' is a baby [[chanese|lingo-meme]] that was delivered by [[BBC|a stork]] to its [[btards|proud parents]] after [[Operation YouTube|a night of wild unprotected sex]] in May 2009.
Like all [[the best]] memes these days '''I'm 12 years old and what is this?''' came out of nowhere, completely [[forced meme|unforced]] and totally  [[random]] -a gift from [[12-year-old boys|the Patron Saint of Anon]]. It serves as a throwaway one-liner in the tradition of [[LOL WUT]] and serves as a reminder that internet using hardcore porn is [[pokemon|super effective]].
==Origins==
Simply put, this little pearl of wisdom came out of the [[BBC]]'s report on the EPIC [[b|4chan]] raid on YouTube when torrents of [[p3rn]] rained down on the unsuspecting masses. In one video titled [[Jonas Brothers]] Live On Stage, a <s>user</s>troll posted a comment saying: '''"I'm 12 years old and what is this?"'''

What results is a mixture of [[newfag|newfags]] trying to call [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|newfag]]. Not knowing of course that they are being trolled by the most basic of trolls. Any 12 year old would know what [[porn|this]] is by that age. 

Others hope that this is the beginning of the next [[lolichan|lolichan]] and try to help out. Not even considering the fact that is likely a [[troll]] or an [[party_van|FBI agent in disguise]].
