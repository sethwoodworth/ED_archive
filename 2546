EFF

=The Electronic Frontier Foundation=
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded outside the [[Internet]] to protect hackers and free speech. A worthy cause, one might think.  The problem is that it has subsequently become a career step for [[lawyer]]s and careerist [[Cory Doctorow|creeps]].

=The Electronic Fuckface Foundation=
Once [[Cory Doctorow|Cawy Doctorow]] joined the EFF, his reverse-Midas touch had its usual effect. As well as being Mr. [[BoingBoing]], Mr. [[Disney]] fan, and all de udder tings, Cawy is now Mr. EFF! No longer dedicated to free speech and action on the [[Internet]], the EFF is totally devoted to the careers of smug [[attention whores]] like Cawy.  The EFF [[13 year old girl|cries]] a lot about [[e-penis|electronic rights]] but when BoingBoing decided to [[delete]] sex writer [[Violet Blue]], the EFF couldn't be bothered to mention it.  Apparently, they [[cyber|care]] a lot more about Cawy than [[teh internets]].
