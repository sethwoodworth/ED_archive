'''UTubeDrama.com''' is the sensationalist site of Trevor Rieger whom bills it as the "National Enquirer Of [[YouTube]]!", when in reality is the highest source of [[phail]] related to the video sharing experience.  Trevor states the following on his website: “UTubeDrama.com is a tabloid [[satire]] website created by Trevor Rieger to expose fake community [[vlog]]gers who ... ‘Game the System’." Oddly enough, Trevor is all about dropping personal information and in fact taking advantage of [[the game]].  [[Some argue|Most agree]] Trevor is an annoying little prat, one who's tried every gimmick under the sun to [[shameless self promotion|make himself a household name]], and he will spam [[you]] to kingdom come given half the chance.  
==utubedrama continues whoring himself on youtube==
utubedrama.com, Trevor Rieger made an effort recently to attack users trying to draw hits to his domain.  He went and registered several domains called GCNPEnteprises, phantom409.org and phantom409.net.  utubedrama effort to whore himself made ultimate LULZ when no one wanted to watch his domain anymore because of his attack on the much retarded phantom409 who recently started a flame war on utubedrama and ,of course, he made stupid ass comments like phantom409 nick was copyrighted and coninually whores utubedrama in impersonating Renetto on dramatube.
==The Site: A Tragedy of Sorts==

The site itself is ultimately merely a collection of very short, very poorly written, captions/blurbs on any given [[drama]] Trevor feels is [[shit nobody cares about|newsworthy]].  He's [[shameless self-promotion|propagandized]] it for some time as being '''the''' site for finding out what's happening on the tubes....it's a good example of [[HTML]] at it's finest, displaying the organizational skills of a [[13 year old boy|13 year old]], both horribly under-designed and implemented.  The site is organized into a series of entries which <s>usually</s> always reveal Trevor's [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT?|gramatically challenged ways]].  Trevor <s>often</s> invariably will take any given situation and then accompany it with [[ALLCAPS|OMG THAT'S SO INTERESTING!]] captions.  This is, of course, expected, but Trevor's [[butthurt|opinions]] often creep into his <s>entries</s> scribblings.  For example, he will state something such as "[http://utubedrama.com/applemilk1988/ Applemilk1988 PARTNERSHIP REINSTATED!...]" (nothing extraordinary or interesting) but will then proceed to follow it with "...[[BAWWWW|YouTuber GIRLS who CRY seems to ALWAYS GET THEIR WAY]]," or something to the effect.  Trevor tends to pad these entries with statements so asinine or out of place that they function more to make him look like the  [[fucktard]]ed product of a 9th grade education rather than entice the readers' interest.  

Since the site went online he has made surgical efforts to purport it as being purely [[satire|satirical]], not to be taken [[seriously]].  This is, unfortunately, a little problematic for Trevor since his statement is an obvious [[lie|inconsistency]] to anyone with a 6th grade education.   The site, for all intents and purposes, functions as a [[unwarranted self importance|pulpit]] for Trevor's well-known [[the man|anti-corporate]], [[victim complex|woe is me]] world-view wherein he campaigns for every lost cause that is in-line with his agenda or whines about every nobody he hates on the tubes.  

==Trevarr: Failuarr==
[[Image:Utubedrama fail dates.png|thumb|right|300px|Trevor even fails at dates.]]
Frustrated by the unsatisfactory results achieved from spamming the living hell out of everything within a five mile radius, Rieger has recently ensured that the continual blunders of the [[butthurt|Pirate's Guild]] are given the appropriate spin and paramount position on his page above the rest of the badly welded text scrawl. The exact terms struck between the 'webmaster' and [[Danielspengies|Steven Newcomb]], the cetacean-like captain of the most hopeless band of trolls ever assembled, is still unclear.  But it can safely be assumed that in exchange for header coverage on his daily drivel board, Trevor has been granted control over Pengies’ fail vessel’s poorly constructed targeting system.  Youtube users that have so far boar the brunt of this ramshackle partnership have of course included Newcomb’s perpetual opponent JipsiK (formerly [[Producing101]]) but more often [[Gimmeabreakman]] who, besides being continually threatened by Pengies, seems to be receiving a full biological profiling by Trevor who now appears to be intent on detailing everything from Victor’s dental records right down to the daily condition of his dog’s ass.

[[File:ILL-SUCK-YOUR-COCK.jpg|thumb|left|Trevor will do anything for drama]]
If you have been a victim of trevor rieger and his utubedrama website, you do have the option to inform his webhost that he is posting defamatory content. by doing this you will be able to inform them of the abuse and possibly get the trevor rieger site banned from the internet. the material on his website is designed to be defamatory and that clearly violates the terms of service of his webhosts.

Trevor thought he was smart by getting a proxy domain server, and then using his own domain name server.. he thought this would deflect the public from shutting down his site. Not any more.
