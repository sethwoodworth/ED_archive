Pixar
[[Image:Citizin.JPG|thumb|This bird is not a bird at all, but a [[computer]]-generated "CGI" graphic made by Pixar. I'll bet you thought it was an actual [[furry]], though!]]

A [[old media|prominent]] [[Computer Graphics|computer-animation]] [[movie]] studio that formed [[at least 100 years ago]]. Pixar's movies use extremely [[Stfu|simplistic]] and predictable plots. To compensate for this, and trick the audience into thinking their movies are actually good, the quality of the animation, voice acting, and musical score is [[over 9000]].

[[Image:Findingemo.png|left|thumb|One of the most [[unfunny]] jokes of [[at least 100 years ago]].]]

It was one fateful [[Last Thursday|Thursday]] evening following the success of [[Star Wars]]. In a corporate party gone terribly wrong, [[George Lucas]] invited a bunch of his media exec friends over for lots and lots of [[McDonald's]] hamburgers. They met in a dark corner and began to pass around the [[Drug#marijuana|pot]]. By morning, nobody could remember a thing but from that day on, Lucas began to feel queasy and suffer from nausea. Nine months later, '''Pixar''' was born.

Being too embarrassed and self-respecting to join [[Teenmommies]], Lucas quickly abandoned his newborn child on the streets, hoping never to see it again. After spending a few years in the orphanage, Pixar was eventually adopted by billionaire philantropist and lovable asshole [[Steve Jobs]].

Pixar became briefly successful in the mid-to-late 1900s and was well-known for producing entertaining quality [[pornography|family films]]. However, like its father Lucas, Pixar soon squandered all of its money, pissed away all of its respect, and began whoring itself out to [[pedophile]] [[Disney|Walt Disney]]. Since then, the studio has largely been ruined by the likes of Michael Eisner and other [[Jews]]. 

Brad Bird is still awesome though, [[amirite]]?

==Facts==

*[[Geek|Enthusiastic Apple Fans]] will always love Pixar's movies, no matter how [[Lolwut|they sucks]]. This is because [[Steve Jobs]] shrouded Pixar in his [[Reality Distortion Field]].

*[[Insane Reynard]] hates Pixar, just as much as he hates Michael Eisner and Encyclopedia Dramatica!
