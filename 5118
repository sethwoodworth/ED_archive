A briefly popular card game that consists entirely of trying to get as many elves into play as possible so that you can "summon" your Beta edition 'Force of Nature' card, merely to justify the $200 you spent on a piece of cardboard.

All [[basement dweller]]s own Magic cards, even if they do not play it anymore.  All basement dwellers have played Magic religiously at some point during their life.

== Variations ==
There are, in fact, many variations on Magic based on what color of cardboard you decided to waste your money on the most.
*'''Green''' - Elves provide manna to fuel rampaging fungi.  Only needs one 'Forest' and a handful of elves, but requires between twenty to thirty of the same $200 card. ''Note: The only [[faggots]] who run green are one's who actually wanna win.''
*'''Red''' - Discard 'Rukh Egg', get a free 3/3 Flying creature.  Requires 60 of the same $120 card - only for experts.  Due to everybody wanting to play Red it usually takes between two and three months to find one of these cards for less than $300.
**'''Burn''' - Forty card deck.  Twelve mountains, and 4 copies of seven identical cards with different names, all which deal 3 damage for one mountain as an instant.  ''Please note: This is the equivalent to hacking in Magic, and [[noone]] will ever play with you again.''
*'''White''' - This color is usually played by white supremacists who, when not spending their money on crack, heroin, and bibles, buy cheap flimsy cardboards to use as rolling papers. Being racists, they always buy white Magic cards. This is how Wizards of the Coast, inc. makes 85% of their money. The other 15% comes from pimping teenagers.
*'''Blue''' - This color is the basis of annoying "Control" decks which are inevitably found in the hands of some nerd who will invoke some rule of the game you didn't know existed in order to counter your every action.  Any [[tourneyfag]] will tell you blue is the hardest color to play and has the most strategic depth. Some examples from Magic's history:
** Buehler Blue (1997): COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER STALKING STONES [[WIN]]
** Go-Mar (2001): COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER DRAGON WIN
** Psychatog (2002-2003): COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER [[DELETE_FUCKING_EVERYTHING|UPHEAVAL]] WIN
** Dralnu du Louvre (2007): COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER [[Cheat|TEFERI]] WIN
** UB Control (2010-2011): COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER COUNTER [[I accidentally|I ACCIDENTALLY]] GRAVE TITAN WIN
If you see someone playing a control deck, the following strategy is considered acceptable:  1) Slowly reach upward 2) Grab your opponent firmly by the throat 3) Squeeze 4) [[????]] 5) [[Profit]].
*'''[[niggers|Black]]''' - Twenty swamps, and forty 'Plague Rats'.  This color is the cheapest to win with because people will just sell these cards for twenty cents each in order to fund their own Red or Green deck.
*'''Gray''' - [[dildo|Artifacts]]; use 'Urza's Mine/Power Plant/Tower', 'Candelabra of Tawnos' and 'Rocket Launcher'.  The 'Candelabra' will set you back around $500, with 'Rocket Launcher' being $60 each (bring extra). [[At_least_100_years_ago|Prior to the Mirrodin block]], artifacts were known as [[Poop|brown magic]].
*'''Gold''' - aka "combo" cards.  These require multiple colors and are therefore a complete waste of money.  Only for the [[hardcore]] Magic player.  Some of the newer sets, i.e. Ravnica, Alara Reborn, feature lots of multicolor cards.
*'''Sliver deck''' - at the start of 3rd turn when playing on a wooden table you may shout "sliver deck" and Proceed to smash your opponent's face into the table, it should be noted that this rule is banned in Quebec

==Magic Online==
Magic Online is where basement dwelling Magic players can further their social separation. Players find other hairy-backed souls on the internets via an AOL-like client. Instead of paying real [[money]] for worthless cardboard, they can pay real money for ''virtual cards'', all with the added benefit of never having to leave home and deal with that nasty thing called sunlight, or the dilemma of actually associating with other nerds. 

Once logged in to MTGO you will come across pathetic wastes of life called ORC's (online response crew) The first qualification you must meet to become an ORC is that you had to be picked on in high school. The second qualification is that you have to be a fucking retarded 1st amendment hating pile of shit who wants to get back at the world by telling people not to swear or use vulgarity.  You will also come across other members who try to impress the ORC's by making stupid comments like, "Will you get a raise if I e-mail something good to your boss".

An alternative to Magic Online is the less popular, free, Apprentice, which when having problems with the solution is always to:
# Uninstall Apprentice
# Install Magic Workstation

Which ruins the only reason to use Apprentice instead of Magic Online. Additionally, Magic Workstation is only available for a 30-day trail before forcing magic nerds to waste at least 1000 dollars on the "real" Magic, but Apprentice was abandoned by it's creator, Dragon Studios, so you're stuck.

== Linguistic History ==
'''Magic''' has been around since it was invented.  The English terms 'magic', 'magically', and 'magical' all derive from this card game - whose title was a simplification of "[[magick]]".  The terms have lost their explicit connection with the game and now simply convey a notion of unusualness, or inexplicability.  Notions which are, understandably, still extended to the people who play this severely [[old meme]].

==The Best Card in the Game==
The best card in the game is [[Lotus Breast|'Black Lotus']] and it costs more than all the cardboard in the world.

Recently, the Black Lotus has been given some competition with the addition of new special edition cards such as the Seung Stainless .38 Artifact card. It has been considered the 1337OMGWTFAZNPWN!!!!11121 card in all NCAA sanctioned Magic tournaments.

==Trolling==
Magic Fags have their own forums, which they take much pride in the sanctity of. The greatest of which is http://mtgsalvation.com/, and then there are official company forums from WOTC
http://forums.gleemax.com/forumdisplay.php?f=131 for magic in general, and http://forums.gleemax.com/forumdisplay.php?f=142 for Magic online.

In general, the best ways to troll Magic fags are to find some piece of shit card and complain about how it's too powerful and[[raep]]s too much, making a shitty deck and claim it's the greatest thing ever, and talk about how much better Yugioh is. MTG Salvation is home to many [[Unwarranted self-importance|wannabe pros]], and reacts particularly lulzily to threads about how tournaments are boring or how only expensive decks can win.

For more specialized and delicious trolling, there is MTGO trolling and rumor trolling. 

Rumor trolling takes much effort, and is creating fake cards and convincing people that they will be in the next set of cards. The place to do this is right here: http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/forumdisplay.php?f=27 . The general rule is you get one point for each person who believes your fake card is real, two points for each thread for strategies based around it, and 1,000 points if it gets added to the "official spoiler" page.

For MTGO, on the forums what you do is either claim that it's perfect and the best thing evar, or that it's the worst thing evar. Either way, much [[butthurt]] ranting and flamewars will ensue. (Extra points if you get a WOTC employee embroiled in the shitstorm.)
The number one way to troll is to create an account on MTGO and play in Team Multiplayer matches. What you do is, create a shitty deck, then join random team matches, most commonly Two-Headed Giant, and then proceed to suck, ruining any chance your partner had of winning. Ways to make it even bettar are being extremely drunk, talking shit, [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER|english as a 4th language]], and pretending to be a n00b. When pretending to be a n00b, you can have the unique opportunity for someone to take pity on you and try to make you suck less. In this case, you should act as retarded as possible without making them [[An hero|give up hope completely.]]
