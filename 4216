Jan Terri
Jan Teri was [[Reh Dogg|an amateur musical artist]] in the late 1980's/early 1990's. Using the most [[VHS|cutting edge]] technological equipment of her time, Jan gave the 1990's some of the most unnerving home videos this side since [[chechclear]].

==Road to Super Stardom==
[[Image:JanTerri LosingYou-714673.jpg|thumb|right|Musical genius.]]
Prior to becoming a pop sensation, Jan Terri made a living as a black person, passing out VHS tapes of her [[Demotivators|demos]] to her passengers in hopes of getting her big break. This worked as [[fail|expected]], and Jan's talent languished as the years passed. However, with the advent of the internet, Jan found her second change at success. Following in the footsteps of [[2girls1cup|other]] [[1guy1jar|immensely]] [[1guy1screwdriver|talented]] [[Bin Laden|individuals]], her artistic vision was revealed to the world. Decked out in [[White trash|only the classiest of faux leather jackets and 4 cans of Aqua Net]], Jan belts out her heartfelt anthems of [[emo|heartbreak]] across Chicago's finest sewage treatment plants and airports. Her rise to the top was astounding as her videos went viral across the web and she was featured on [[The Daily Show|national television]]. Unfortunately for Jan, this occurred in 2000, long before [[YouTube|websites that would]] [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|appreciate her talent were established]]. However, as with all [[Samwell|brilliant artists]], the internet has all but assured that Jan Terri will be, now and forever, [[Shit nobody cares about|remembered]].

==The Hits==

===''Losing You''===

Her [[Internet celebrity|most well known]] single, '''Losing You''' was a tale of heartbreak and redemption. Doing her best impression of an English Bulldog and struggling to keep her balance, when the camera isn't zooming out into the distance we spot a spandex laden Jan forcing herself on  [[Mexican]] [[Redneck|Billy Ray Cyrus]]. Given very subtle context clues, we're left to interpret Jan is very successful in life (complete with fancy limo and luggage carrying negro) but contemplates throwing it all away for the wild excitment with her outlaw beau. Parking in a No Parking Zone? That's the kind of crazy life Jan Terri craves! Probably. She later admited she can't remember what she was singing about.

===''Baby Blues''===

In this dedication to [[Hitler]]s glorious vision of a [[Aryan|blond, blue eyed]] master race, Jan serenades the audience with her vision of a man with eyes blue enough that they could somehow shoot gallons of water from them at will while simultaneously paying tribute to one her musical inspiration Elmer Fudd.

===''Journey to Mars''===

After regaining consciousness after spending a crazy weekend [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Meth#Methamphetamine methed] out while having a Pink Floyd record playing in the background, Jan decided to try her hand at [[Nerd|prog rock]]. Donning aluminum foil jumpsuits, Jan and friends sulked around town for an afternoon making strange, [[Caramelldansen|alien-like]] gestures in front of various locations, adding in the most visually advanced [[Computer Graphics|graphic animation]] available at the time. When it still looked like shit, they threw in some [[lens flare]] and called it a day.
