{{youtube}} or '''TF''' ([[powerword]]: Laverne) is an [[atheist]] [[youtube]], lover of [[Anonymous]], and friend of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]. Initially a serious scientific channel Thunderf00t's  views have brought the disdain of [[fat|TheAmazingAtheist]], [[Coughlan666|Coughlan666]] and [[shit nobody cares about|other YouTube sponsored members of Living With Tourette's]] all feel "[[Bullshit|Thunderf00t is an asshole/racist/bigot]]!!!!." this came about due to constant [[flame wars]], [[drama]], and coke-binges which caused Thunderf00t to resort to inflicting direct [[pwnage|pwnage]] upon his detractors. <BR>
'''UPDATE:''' Thunderf00t, unlike the regular retard on youtube, refuses to stay butthurt and whine for ever and has now gone back to pwning the bejezzus out of creationists morons like [[venomfangx]]. 
Thunderf00t spearheaded the [[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day]] campaign in the name of free speech. What followed was a slew of videos of Thunderf00t raping Arabs with idea of free speech. Ironically though, Everyone Draw Mohammed Day resulted in Pakistan's access to [[Youtube|les tubes]] being restricted by the Pakistani government and [[Osama Bin Laden|prominent Pakistani residents]] were reportedly cut off from [[Youtube_poop|fetish decapitation videos]]. Still TF00t called win, as it proved what he maintained all along, [[islam]] doesnt give a shit about free speech. 

== Why do people laugh at creationists? ==
A pretty lulzy series, [[some argue]] is still his number one video work.

== [[Flame War|Flame Wars]] ==

=== [[VenomFangX]] ===
There was a time when TF and VenomFangX were engaged in constant war with each other, trials lasting well over [[at least 100]] years. VenomFagX won a few battles by launching massive [[DMCA]] missiles at TF's videos, succeeding in sinking his battleships for a time, but needless to say TF's stamina was [[:File:Broly.jpg|maximum]] in the long run, as VenomFangX has recently [[deleted fucking everything]] as he runs crying to his pastor for his afternoon [[cock|pacifier]], [[ruined]] to the core. A [[asspat|solid victory]] for thunderf00t.
<br>
'''UPDATE'''! Thunderf00t, cheif asslicker TPRJones, and JordanOwen42, have succeeded in infiltrating VenomFangX's base (his dad) and are now in the process of mindfucking him into atheism.

=== Ray Comfort Way of the Master ===
Thunderf00t hooked up with the evangelical Ray Comfort last Thursday to have a 'discussion' in Ray's Way of the Master studio in sunny southern California. While TF succeeded in pwning Ray's ability to describe [[evolution]], the overriding impact of the video (Thunderf00t's first unedited show) was Thunderf00t's un-fucking-believably bad [[retard]] stutter. 

=== [[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day|Dramahamed Day]] ===

Thunderfoot, realizing that money is good, went into partnership with the Jewtubes, and was a drama whore of global scale, having  gone bananas with the Draw Mohammed (aka: Draw More Ham Head or Dramahamed Day), a venture that brought uncountable loads of /b/tards to his subscriber whore list who all drew the founder of [[Islam|ragheadism]] in retaliation for [[Islam]]'s owning of Comedy Central's permabanning of showing Mohammed, the sick pedophilic fuck who founded the [[lulz|lulzfest]] called '[[Islam]].' By cheering for the [[over 9000]] shitty posts (mostly stick-figures) and [[butthurt]] about the [[Ground Zero Mosque]], Thunderf00t has proven his hatred of [[Muslims]]. And he still didn't troll Jews yet, [[JEWS DID WTC|despite perfectly good reason]].

=== HowTheWorldWorks ===
Last Thursday, [[unfunny]], obnoxious Youtube Atheist, The Amazing Atheist was getting promptly pwned by Youtube Conservative and David Wain impersonator, HowTheWorldWorks. Thunderf00t, in a typically fashion, decided to intervene to put an end to HowTheWorldWork's refusal to blink and boring, rambling, talking-point infested videos. What followed was the battle of the least charismatic, most boring, most butthurt conservatard on Youtube against the the super genius guy who calls himself bunny ''on Youtube.'' HowTheWorldWork's arguments consisted of defending crazy conspiracies like the idea that Arabs were behind 9/11, socialists buttfuck Hitler, and that Thunderf00t has a haircut that Jerry Garcia would be ashamed to have. Thunderf00t, not dismayed by HowTheWorldWorks' [[unfunny|epic]] insults, rejoined by saying that Capitalism emboldens slave trade, that England is made of win and bad teeth because of Socialism, and asked, "if HowTheWorldWorks loves Capitalism so much why won't he buy some nicer shirts, buy some dandruff shampoo, and blink every once in a while?" The [[gay|climactic]] battle raged on for a few weeks but fizzled when both HTWW and Thunderf00t realized that no one gave a shit and that they both know fuck-all about politics or political theory. Needless to say, the battle of HTWW v. Thunderf00t killed over 9000 Youtubers out of sheer boredom.

=== Even Thunderf00t Parties ===

Thunderf00t is also a known raver, with a radioactive glowing nipple that only works when he wears his favoroute shirt. Admittedly stuck in the 70s wierd al... erm Thunderf00t is welll... heh.
