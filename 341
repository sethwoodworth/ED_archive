Alexander-sama
"Alexander-sama" is a new, somewhat forced [[meme]] presented by a growing collection of [[4chan]] [[oldfag]]s, [[Fail|agingfag]]s, and [[newfag]]s who have found important messages in his rare threads.

== Faggotry ==

The man himself, whose name (according to his claim) is "Alexander," has made little to no attempt at any major recognition. Instead, his concern often lies in the condition of [[4chan]]'s [[/b/]]. However, the amount of support for his cause has led to a large number of [[idiot]]s to kiss his ass in an unproductive, sometimes even cancerous manner throughout [[/b/]]. The “Alexander Fan Club” consists mainly of [[newfag]]s who insist not on hearing Alexander's actual messages, but on feeling as though they are part of something. In his third official thread, Alexander personally told these individuals to shut the fuck up.

== Posts ==

Alexander's first official appearance was at the end of his legendary [[EFG]] thread, during which he pretended to be the original [[EFG]] artist in order to thoroughly explain the cancer of [[/b/]] and present a simple solution (one which Alexander often repeats later on): [[original content]]. During Alexander's [[EFG]] thread, he actually did a very terrible job, in terms of the images themselves, of disguising himself. However, most [[/b/tard]]s still listened to him. Many have speculated that Alexander just got lucky, but the more likely case is that his poor trickery was on purpose; the [[newfag]]s were fooled enough that most would shut up, while the [[oldfag]]s knew it wasn't [[EFG]], and thus were not distracted from the purity of the message Alexander was attempting to send. This thread was one of the biggest sources of chemo in a long time.

Alexander's second official thread was a retaliation to [[forced meme]]s, such as [[Dick Butt]]. Rather than outright explaining the thread's purpose, Alexander instead disguised it as a [[newfag]] "[[Everyone Get In Here]]" thread. One can easily tell that this is because Alexander did not wish to speak with those who were already against [[forced meme]]s, but instead aimed to attract the very type of crowd which had taken part in such faggotry. During the thread, he proposed a new false meme, which died with the thread: for good reason, and probably an intentional discontinuation. The thread itself turned many [[newfag]]s and [[gaiafag]]s against each other. Those which had once said [[Dick Butt]] began to argue with others of the same. For four days after the thread, no major instance of [[Dick Butt]] or any other [[forced meme]] could be found. However, the effect of this chemo could not last forever.

Alexander's third and latest thread was a call for [[W. T. Snacks]]. He proposed that the userbase of [[4chan]] convince [[Moot]] to accept [[Snacks]] back, and that [[Snacks]] be paid by the very [[/b/tard]]s who miss him. The thread was incredibly popular and surpassed 500 posts. [[/b/tard]]s who knew [[Snacks]] personally were unsure, as [[Snacks]] himself has displayed bitterness towards [[4chan]] after having been fired by [[Moot]]. However, the plan was solid. Some [[/b/tard]]s have begun to call it “Donate or Die, Snacks edition.”

== Identity ==

Alexander is a self-titled [[newfag]]. This has been called into question on numerous occasions. Alexander's name is supposedly “Alexander.” This too has been called into question on numerous occasions. His reason for abandoning anonymity is unknown, though some suggest that it was to give his messages more meaning. Others theorize that he merely enjoys attention, though this is greatly contradicted by the way Alexander acts in regards to his “followers.”

Alexander posts a picture of himself with each post, and always one which has been taken moments before. According to Alexander, this is to prevent any clones of himself to appear. He also claims that these pictures are always taken with a “crappy camera phone,” explaining why they are almost always very dark. Needless to say, [[shoop]]s of him have been made. Though Alexander proves himself with a photo at the end of each thread he founds, Alexander has never started a thread out as himself. The most obvious reason for this is to draw attention onto his topic and not himself. All three of Alexander's threads on /b/ have been placed in the archives by popular vote among [[4chan]] users, but are still in the review process.

== Outside 4chan ==

Alexander has also been spotted multiple times on infinitychan, where a great number of [[oldfag]]s and [[newfag]]s pretending to be [[oldfag]]s fled after his first thread. Infinitychan has become much like a base of operations for those providing [[chemo]] for the [[cancer]] of [[/b/]]. On infinitychan, Alexander has expressed little more than what he has told [[4chan]], with the exception of a brief poetic allegory against the longcat crusade, which he feels will merely attract more [[gaiafag]]s to [[4chan]].
