Scouse
{{Spoiler|The Beatles are Scouse}}

Scouse is another fucked up form of the English Language used by [[Retards|retards]] in the North-West of [[England|England]], particularly in Liverpool, [[Truth|a tiny third-world country attached to (but not part of) Great Britain]].

== Scousers ==

[[File:Scoucesupporters.jpg|thumb|Many Scousers are [[Obsessed|obsessed]] with their local [[Football|Fagball]] team, which is often Liverpool. They will argue that any Scousers who support another team are not real Scousers. This generally makes them [[Faggots|Fags.]]]]

[[File:Liverpool aerial view.jpg|thumb|Liverpool - The [[Shit|shithole]] where most Scousers come from]]

Not to be confused with [[Chavs|Chavs]], although [[Truth|a lot of Scousers may be considered as both]]. Scousers are yet another type of [[British|British]] [[Cum|scum]] who have been around for [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100 years]] and should be greeted with total [[Disregard that, I suck cocks|disregard]]. This is because they are [[Cock|cocky]], obnoxious and [[Unwarranted Self Importance|full of it.]] [[You|You]] may be wondering how this makes them any different from [[Chavs|Chavs]]. The [[42|answer]] to this question is that [[The Beatles|some Scousers are generally nice people and are capable of possessing even an ounce of talent.]] There are no black people on the Internet


Scousers are [[Famous|well known]] for sounding like complete [[special|downers]] when they speak. This is called 'Scouse'. You should never reply to a Scouser with [[Grammar Nazi|grammatically correct sentences]], as it will probably not understand [[wtf|what the fuck]] you are talking about. Instead, you can respond by [[Violence|hitting them with a bat.]] Here are some examples of what you might hear a Scouse person say, and the [[Grammar Nazi|grammatically correct]] translations:


*'Ihe Lah?' - How are you?
*'Gizza' - [[Secks|Give it to me]], often said during a game of [[Football|Foohball]] in order to get a team-mate to [[gay|make a pass]].
*[[Doing it wrong|'Dey don'h do dah dere doh do dey doh?']] - No-one performs such an action in that location.
*'Bang yer lighs ouh' - Could either mean [[secks|I'm going to have some rough sex with you]] or [[violence|I'm going to kick the shit out of you]]. Can cause major [[lulz|confusion.]]
*[[Chicken|'Sheccken']] - Chicken (the k is often pronounced with a 'grr').
*[[McDonalds|'Maccie D's]] - McDonald's (again, the double c is pronounced with that 'grr' noise). Scousers often go to McDonald's because they are too [[White Trash|poor]] to afford [[food|actual food]].
*[[Britfag|'Chippy']] - Fish and Chip shop. Another [[Poor|cheap]] source of food.
*[[cool|'Sowwwnd']] - A general expression that something is [[Awesome|awesome.]]
*[[School|'Skewwl']] - A concentration camp for many scouse [[13 year old boys|children.]] Generally, sending a scouse child here is pointless because Scoucers are fucking [[idiots|brainless]] due to all the fights they get into at football matches when they're older, so all that shit they learn will be knocked out of their heads anyway.
*[[Police|Bizzies]] - Police. Short for "Busybodies."
*Scally - Criminal. Short for "Scallywag."
*'Scatty' - Unpleasant or unclean.
*'Kecks' - Pants, Trousers.
*'Mingin' - Also a word to describe something that is Unpleasant or Unclean. Used more by female [[Scouse|Scousers]] . A slight variation of the word is 'Minger', which also used by girls, means an Ugly or Unpleasant Man. 

'''It should be nohed dah many Scoucers cannoh pronounce their t's unless they are at the starh of a wiiirrrd or lead by an 's', and will instead use a rough 'h' sowwwwnd. Scousers will also ascend from a low pitch to a high pitch when saying wiiirrrds.'''

== Origins ==
[[File: Scouce.jpg|thumb|[[Lolwut|Lolwut?]] They actually like this [[Shit|shit?]]]]
[[Wikipedia|Apparently,]] Scousers contain roots mainly from [[Irish|Ireland]], which may explain why they are so [[Chavs|disorderly and antisocial.]] The name, on the other hand, comes from a type of lamb or beef stew called 'Scouse', which was imported from [[Norway|Norway]] by [[Semen|seamen.]] Because Liverpudlians loved this food and [[Fat|ate it all the time]], they were nicknamed 'Scousers'. This probably explains why black person as the only meat niggers like is [[KFC|chicken.]]

== Mancs ==
It is arguable as to whether [[fags|fags]] from Manchester are also Scouse because their accents are fairly similar. However, since most Scousers [[hate|hate]] Mancs for supporting Manchester United, they will disagree. This causes a lot of [[butthurt|butthurt]] for [[Monkey|Wayne Rooney]], who is a Scouser that plays for the Mancs.

1) It is a country.

2) It is a shithole.]]
