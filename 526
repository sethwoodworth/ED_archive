'''[http://www.anonidate.com/ AnoniDate]''' is a strange venture that takes the concepts of forced anonymous and online dating and combines them. Targeting [[/b/tards]], [[gamers]], [[otaku]] and to a lesser extent [[furfags]], AnoniDate can best be described as a sausage fest. The percentage of girls on AnoniDate is very close to proving the physical constant of [[no girls]] on the interbutts. There are a few females; however, you must roll [[1d20]] if she is a [[trap]].

==Scientolology boom==
After the [[Scientology]] protest boom, AnoniDate's userbase has increased [[Over 9000|tenfold]], though there are still very few girls to be seen.
