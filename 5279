Megan Had It Coming

'''Megan Had It Coming''' is the title of a blog created on November 18, 2007 by a person calling herself "Kristen" who claimed to be [[lesbian|close]] to the [[Megan_Meier|Megan Meier]] [[MySpace]] [[Suicide]] [[drama|controversy]]. The blog contained three posts: "Set the record straight," "Who's really at fault?" and "I'm Lori Drew."

Within three weeks, the blog had received over 5,300 comments, reports on CNN and Fox News, widespread condemnation, a statement from the Drew attorney denying Lori was the author, and a pledge from the St. Louis [[Detective|Cyber Crimes]] police division to investigate whether the blog violated any [[Internet_Law|laws]], and who created the blog.

==U GOT RICKROLLED==
On December 9, all entries in the MHIC blog were replaced with a single entry containing a [[Rickroll]] and a link to Encyclopedia Dramatica. Chances are, if you're reading this, you already knew that. You may now choose to familiarize youself with the concept of [[LULZ]].

While the blog appeared to be a defense of Lori Drew, the [[Psychopath|sociopathic]] neighbor mom accused of masterminding the plot to kill Megan, it actually demonstrated the collective stupidity of thousands of Internet users who confuse replying to [[blogs]] for having actual [[stfu|intellectual discourse]].

==EPIC TROLL IS EPIC==
Several individuals and blogs, including Death By 1000 Papercuts, attempted to capitalize on the controversy with [[YOU_ARE_DOING_IT_WRONG|in-depth]] reporting on the blog, and asking [[noone|experts]] for opinions on the writings.

{{quote|I conferred with a blogging friend of mine who is a cybersecurity expert and we both agreed that [[O RLY?|ANONYMOUS and MHIC were the same person.]]|Internet Genius Trench Reynolds, MyCrimeSpace|100%}}

The further attention spurred thousands of [[fucktards|Internet users]] to flood the blog with messages of hate and condemnation. As of December 9, the blog had received [[Over_9,000|over 5,300]] comments.
