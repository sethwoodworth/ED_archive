Hannah Bond
{{an hero}}


[[Image:Hannahbond.jpg|thumb|right| Not only stupid as fuck, but ugly too!]]

'''Hannah "Swinger" Bond''' was a [[13-year-old girl|13 year old]] [[faggot|emo]] [[poser]] [[Oneoneone|!!11]] [[emo|fan]] of the band [[My Chemical Romance]]. She is noted for becoming [[an hero]] by hanging herself, and the shitstorm <s>her parents</s> retarded MCR fans have caused about her death. 

__TOC__

==AN HERO==
Before [[an hero]] was even in the ground, her parents started going to various media outlets blaming [[WHEN I WAS| My Chemical Romance]] for her daughter's suicide (instead of their shitty parenting). Many lulz ensued.

==Old Media's Reaction==
Several [[lulzy]] articles in [[British]] newspapers ''The Telegraph'' and ''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]'' were penned following this [[lulzy|tragic]] turn of events. Lulz include comparing [[emo]] [[faggotry]] to a [[religion]], as seen in this quote:

{{quote|She had secretly chatted to “emo” followers online all over the world, talking about death and the glamorisation of hanging and speaking about “the black parade” - a place where “emos” believe they go after they die.|The [[old media]] has clearly done its research.}}

So Hannah now is clearly in the Black Parade for her [[an heroism]], enjoying her [[Islam|72 virgins]] (screamo band keyboardists).

==8/5/08==	 
On May 8th, a number of [[aspie|courageous]] /b/tards stumbled upon her memorial page and posted links to it on [[4chan]]. Needless to say the site was swamped with lulzy comments from bored [[Americunts]] and insomniac [[United Kingdom|Britfags]]. A total of ten pages worth of [[An hero|suicide]] jokes, meme spouting and a healthy dose of [[necrophilia]] were posted (not to mention people coming to tell Hannah that she [[you are doing it wrong|did it wrong]]) and much lulz was had by all. Of course, the owners of the memorial page being [[13-year old boy|13-year old]] kids guaranteed that the best was yet to come.

==The Shitstorm==
When her [[fucktard|friends]] came back from school the next day and realized that their precious memorial page had been fucked with, they promptly [[BAWWW|complained]] to the Bebo admins. The Admins, however were [[unwarranted self importance|too busy sucking their own cocks]] to care about some shitty memorial page and the shitstorm escalated from there. As the evening wore on, and more [[troll|/b/tards]] came online to survey the havoc they found themselves in a particularly savage flamewar, which continued throughout the night and into the next day. It was only after 1pm on Saturday 10th May that the [[banhammer]] started coming down. <s>The current state of her memorial profile is unknown,</s>[http://skin.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=8428857806] but the clear moral of the story is that bebo admins are some of the [[retarded|laziest]] fuckwits out there.

==The article==
Since its inception soon after the bebo raids and not long after her death the article has become one of ED's most furious warzones. The mass blankings and reverts have provided their own form of lulz. Here is what some of the more [[oxymoron|literate]] members of the [[retard|emo]] community have had to say about the article on [[Leave Bond to me|Hannah Bond]]:

{{quote|[[LOL WUT|If anyone actually cared about what all you idiots think about hannah, you wouldn't get messages attacking you!]] leave her alone and let her be. She is not a poser and was not an emo 'follower'. shut up all you journalists, dimwits, and haters. she did nothing wrong. She was just upset and needing some love. You have taken any love she had away from her and more, even after death. Go away and to be honest you should just delete this article altogether. it doesn't need to be here. neutral or biased, it's only doing everyone harm.|Xpoisonxgirlx failing to understand the userbase or purpose of Encyclopedia Dramatica.}}

{{quote|Its low and discusting to make jokes about a tragic event, It sickens me so I cannot find words for it. There are no words for such scum.|Jrod1195 on not having a dictionary.}}

{{quote|[[I did it for the lulz|Why write this Its horrible]]|Hiphoppopsawah on rhetorical questions and unnecessary capitalization.}}

{{quote|The person who write this just got this shit off a newspaper and wants to make it worse since they carnt live their own sad lives so they have to wreck everyone elses thats just not fair on hanah she didnt say to her parents "I want to kill myself" she wouldnt have thats what the newspapers say becasue they just want a birra gossip to tell but theyre shit liars , she had things in life wich made her feel down and things and she didnt think life would be worth living because it was so hard for her and what i heard she was a nice friendly girl and she was very pretty but whoever wrote this needs to get a life and like i saiid if they have a problem tell me bout it xxskyexxjonesxx@hotmail.com i dont think it faiir that people are judging her wen they obv didnt know her ! R.I.P Hannah x x x x|XoxIndy-cindyxox's reply to the question, "In a single sentence, tell us about [[lol wut|retrospective psychoanalysis]] and the merits of the British Journalism establishment.  Also being highly incapable of using a single full stop (or grammar)."}}
