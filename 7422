Shannon Matthews

* The abductors turned out to be her mother and [[Pedophile|stepfather]]'s uncle.</b>}}

Since the [[lulz|disappearance]] of [[Madeleine McCann]] in 2007, people have been [[shit nobody cares about|increasingly concerned at the thought of children being abducted]]. In February 2008 their nightmares came true when <b>Shannon Matthews</b> suddenly went missing. All over the world, people were worried until photos of her were released. Hospitals were inundated that night with a mass vomiting bug.

On the 15th of March 2008 an air of sorrow fell over [[England]] when the unthinkable was confirmed:
The little [[bitch]] survived.

Shannon does not even know that she's been abducted.|Shannon's relatives. [[Ya rly]]}}

[[Image:KarenPedobear.jpg|thumb|250px|Shannon's mother has frank negotiations with [[Pedobear]]. He politely declined.]]

There is one reason and one reason only as to why <b>Shannon</b> disappeared: Money.
Following the supreme example of the [[Madeleine McCann]] Hoax of 2007, the Matthew's plan was simple but brilliant:


1. Sneak up on neighbours window and peek through to watch Shameless on terrestrial tv.

2. Gain public sympathy and haul in their money .

3. [[????]]

4. MOAR [[PROFIT]]

5. Play the banjo.


It was perfect except for one tiny problem: Shannon lacked the raw sexual appeal of Maddie.
Just who on Gods earth would they find to penetrate the ugly little pig?  The stepfather (Craig Meeehan), who as a 22 year old boy living on a council estate in Britain, was more than qualified for the task of fucking an underage girl. And as an avid collector of CP, Craig certainly had the connections, should he require use of a porn dungeon.  For this clan of Lower-Class [[chavs]] it was the perfect scheme to get rich quick - not only did they have moar money than they could ever want, but unlike [[Paris Hilton]] there would be no daughter to spent it all. Happy days indeed, and with their newfound wealth, they could afford to keep themselves fat on Micro Chips, Pot Noodle, and Lottery scratchcards.

<b>The Evidence:</b>

National newspaper <i>The Sun</i> offered a £20K reward for her return.
She was returned by the police. And no, the police have not received any £20K donations. Conveniently.


===Epic [[Fail]]===
Shannon's [[Pedophile|stepfather Craig Meehan]], 22, has denied having anything to do with the child's disappearance and again dismissed claims he had hit her, although it is said that the bruises were a massive improvement visually.

He also dismissed comparisons between his family and the parents of missing Madeleine McCann, citing Kate McCann's tits as the main difference between the two cases. The other difference being that the McCann's were smart enough to get rid of what was left after they raped and killed their daughter.

With all the degrading sexual practices in the world - [[Goatse]], the [[Mr. Hands]] video, [[Rule 34]] - not even those most vile of predators known as [[pedophiles]] could bring themselves to [[molest]] her.

Shannon is a classic example of someone who was [[almost raped]] - although she was kidnapped, bundled up in a small box for three weeks and has a father who would sell her to a [[pedo]], she was not actually fucked, therefore should receive no sympathy. Her parents already have classic examples of [[unwarranted self-importance]] and should be [[holocaust|exterminated]].

{{quote|
A local paedophile ring has made the unprecidented step of issuing a statement after being accused of hiding Shannon Matthews for two weeks.

They said "Fuck off - we do have some standards you know!"|Even sick fucks have their limits.}}

The abductor turned out to be the uncle of Shannon's [[Pedophile|stepfather]]. [[Srsly]]. The spawn he had adopted was so repulsive he had to convice his uncle to carry her off.
Eventually, this pervert couldn't take it - the thought of this creature touching his dick was too much to bear.

[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2008/03/17/shannon-man-new-abuse-quiz-89520-20353727/ "I'm too sexy for my niece . . ."]

<b>Paul Drake a.k.a. Mick Donovan</b> has been charged with child sexual abuse before, after molesting two boys when living with their family:

<i>"He told me if I laughed when he tickled me I would have to take a piece of clothing off."</i> Says the younger brother. <i>"Unfortunatly his [[dick]] was so tiny I couldn't help but laugh."</i>


It is rumoured that <b>Paul Drake</b> kidnapped <b>Shannon Matthews</b> because he mistook her for a boy, but couldn't obtain an erection when he discovered her [[cock]] was bigger than his.
After the discovering the horrifying creature hiding under his bed Donovan soon attempted to [[emo|cut his wrists]]. This did not work because as he was removed from Shannon he found that all the blood was rushing to his [[dick]].

==The Aftermath==

Immediately after the discovery that Shannon was alive the town where she lived has a huge [[piss]]-up involving vomit, [[Mr. Hands|sex with animals]] (including Shannon's mother) and [[shit]] eating, usually all at once.
At first people mistook this for 'celebrating'. This is not true - all [[English]] people a.k.a. [[Chavs]] are known to do this on a daily basis as a pathetic attempt to hide their true [[faggotry]].

[[Some argue]] this was not an appropriate way to celebrate, as anybody who isn't a [[sick fuck]] would be happy at the thought of this sub-human spawn being alive.


Shannon herself was supposedly given a [[lolcat]] by the [[police]] to calm her down while being interviewed. They afterwards destroyed the cat [[for the lulz]]. West Yorskire police are currently keeping her as an aid to [[DO NOT WANT|deter]] [[pedophiles|kiddie fiddlers]] from committing more [[Baby fuck|offenses]].

===This is Not a Joke===
{{spoiler|The whole kidnapping WAS a scam}}

[[Image:ShannonTimeline.jpg|thumb|200px|From british newspaper The Daily Mail. Remember [[you]] read it first on [[Encyclopaedia Dramatica]]!]]

Because this is [[Encyclopaedia Dramatica]], you could be mistaken into thinking that this is all an elaborate, sick joke. Oh no. [[Anonymous|We]] are not the only people who think there is something suspicious about all this:

<b>Quotes From Sky News:</b>

<center>{{morphquote|SM1|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;

|This is very strange, is this the only child ever abducted that has been found alive. I mean, I am extremely relieved that she has, but I think the whole ordeal is very suspicious. Did the family hope they were gonna make money in the same way the McCanes have with their campaign? Or did she run away and hide with the help of Donavan? I dont believe everything is as it first appears.|

|yeah I reckon a scam was afoot..............|[[O rly]]?

|That psychologist from Aberdeen a few pages back--good point, his or hers. The elements of dysfunction--the mother with seven children by five fathers (or is it five children and seven dads?), the rum-looking fishmonger a decade her junior, the ogres and banshees ogling and hooting in the family tree--are well in place for this to wind up being a colossal scam. As many have noted on these pages, clearly something's amiss.|

|[[ALL_CAPS|I AM SO GLAD SHE HOME, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING NOT RIGHT ABOUT THIS IM SORRY BUT MUST SPEAK AS I SEE WHY OH WHY HAVE THE POLICE NOT BEEN LOOKING FOR HER THERE ALREADY, IT JUS DOESN`T ADD UP NOR DOES HER MOTHER IM SORRY SHE BEEN THOUGH IT BUT IM NOT SURE SHE NOT AWARE OF IT]]|

|I'm glad that she has been found. However, I find it questionable that the Mother didn't know where she was. Only the most recent article published, before Shannon was found, the Mother stated someone she knew had abducted Shannon. Frankly, I believe there is much more to this story than meets the eye. Could this have been a ploy?|

|Sorry to have to say this folks, but the more that emerges from all this leads me to the uneasy feeling that something is rotten in the State of Denmark.|Something rotten was hiding under the bed too.

|Whilst I am delighted to hear that Shannon is alive and well, I have to question whether this was in fact an abduction or a major scam, which is about to back fire. I don't want to draw comparisons with the McCann's but obviously some in the press have been complicit in this. Which cruel editor allowed the photograph of Karen Matthews holding that tatty teddy bear to published. Karen is no Kate McCann and that teddy bear was no Cuddle Cat. If ever there was a case for eugenics then that was it!|Delighted to here the girl is alive but moar happy to kill the little bitch's mother.

<b>9th April 2008</b> - Shannon Matthews' mother has been taken into court after confessing she knew who kidnapped her [[fugly|little angel]].
Her plan - which consisted of [[epic fail]] and [[CP]] - was based on the idea that since there were [[retards|people]] out there willing to [[fuck]] her already vile and [[cum]]-bloated body, surely there was someone sick enough to do the same to her precious little girl. How fucking wrong she was.


So far she has been charged with neglect and perverting the course of justice (because there's nothing moar perverted that the thought of fucking Shannon amirite?).


It was discovered that a scam was in motion after Karen approached a spokesman for [[Madeleine McCann]] and [[lolwut|asked them for money]]. This plot however [[fail|failed]] because people would pay good money to make sure they would never have to see the little [[shit]]-faced pig-fucker again.

This whole thing reminds me of 'Shameless' on C4|Anon}}


Police are now looking into the possibility that the Matthews family DID get the idea from an episode of Shameless shown a few days before initial disappearance [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/08/nshannon308.xml], proving once again that Life = Art and that [[ED]] is the source of all knowledge.

<i><b>Charges Against Karen Matthews</b></i>

#On the days between Feb 18 and March 15 she wilfully neglected or abandoned Shannon in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering to her or injury to her health.
#Between Feb 18 and March 15, with intent to pervert the course of public justice, did a series of acts which had a tendency to pervert the course of public justice by repeatedly concealing information in relation to the whereabouts of Shannon in interviews and other contacts with police and claiming to have no knowledge of her whereabouts.

<b>Epic Update! 04/12/2008</b> Mummy dearest [[sick fucks|Karen Matthews and lover boy's uncle Michael Donovan]] have been found guilty of kidnap, unlawful imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.

==Fun Facts==

<center><Small>{{morphquote|SM2|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;

|<b>Karen Matthews is a total [[slut]]</b>:<br>
Karen Matthews, Shannon’s mother, has infinity children by many fathers. Shannon was thought locally to have a twin brother who lived with their natural father. It emerged this week that the two children were born a year apart. Their mother called them twins merely because they had the same father. When a female relative was giving interviews about the missing child on the day after Shannon disappeared, her husband loudly reminded her to charge “a fiver for a feel” , then roared with laughter at his own wit.

<br>
Shannon absolutely loves him. She thinks of him as a dad. They're always cuddling up on the sofa together watching telly. The night before Shannon disappeared they had a huge tickle fight and were in fits of laughter. Craig is devastated by all this.|[[You]] have to wonder why Craig didn't do the job himself.

The majority of ‘vulnerable’ missing persons do not meet with tragic consequences.

The Police National Missing Persons Bureau (PNMPB) collects vulnerable missing person reports which are still outstanding after 14 days. Of the 2,197 missing persons entered onto their database in 1997/8, 1,561 (71.0%) had been traced by the end of the year.

Only 938 reports related to missing persons under the age of 18, of which 692 (73.8%) had been traced by the end of the year.|If the government says it, it mus be true.
