== Origins ==
'''Trollface''' (often referred to by [[newfags]] as '''Coolface''') is a [[meme]] originating from an [[MS Paint Relationship Thread|MS Paint comic]] by a [[deviantART|TARTlet]] named {{deviantart|whynne|Whynne}} that rightly describes the nature of [[troll]]ing as a cop-out. First rearing its ugly head on the mortal plane in [[4chan]]'s [[v/|/v/]] around November 2008, it has been shown to catch on easily in other parts of the Internet inhabited by stupid trolls (i.e. all of it). Trollface's proliferation was aided in no small part by the fact that his ridiculous grin is [[science|scientifically]] proven to induce intense levels of [[lulz]] in many individuals and to cool down any situation by [[under 9000|over 2,000%]]

'''FUN FACT:''' Whynne claims the face resulted from his attempt to draw [[Rape Rodent]]. Though he failed to capture the exact essence of the original image, the artist unintentionally gave birth to a meme of greater popularity than the one he was mimicking.

== Trolldad ==
One of many unfunny variations of trollface, Trolldad is very much like your parents, he doesn't love you.

== Trollface vs. Coolface? == 
Since his 2008 debut, Trollface's malevolent influence has spread into the smaller *[[chans]], but effigies of his likeness are typically erected in [[/v/]] where he goes by his true name, and seen infrequently in the lesser tribes of Newfagland, where he is often mistakenly referred to as "Coolface". The cause for discrepancy stems from an edit of the original comic posted in response to an [[Original Content|original content]] thread in /[[r9k]]/, variations of the concept typically involve people escaping situations by [[Copypasta|copypasting]] Trollface onto their heads and asking the suspicious or confused individual, "problem?" invariably followed by the aforementioned individual telling him "get the fuck out of here!" Unfortunately these offshoots are often written by underage B&, and the result is almost always a heaping pile of [[unfunny]] [[fail]] and the only trace of [[lulz|comedy]] in the comic is Trollface's presence. Despite the fact that only the artists find these funny, the concept nonetheless has caught on and spread, leading to the common reference by failfags to the "cool face".

Trollface has become a commonplace response to anyone (See also: [[You Mad|U MAD BRO?]]), who, upon realizing that what their post was unintentionally [[Asperger's|fucking retarded]], is compelled to admit (or point out as if being all the wiser) in the same thread that he/she was just trolling you. This [[retarded|clever]] ruse, of course, is so obvious that can be spotted from fifteen miles away as a shitty attempt to save face. The image, often accompanied by the statement "I TROLL U" has become the normal response to any such attempts, but has since also come to be used as an all-purpose flag to identify a troll before a [[shitstorm]] occurs, despite the fact that one always does.

Posting Trollface in response to opinions on just about anything has become something of a method to troll in itself, and as a result it has become hard to discern whether or not one is using it legitimately or just trying to piss on [[Asperger's|someone's]] opinion by implying that they must be trolling.

Trollface is as well main part of the official /v/ dance. The dance itself represents the unity and harmony between the different gaming platforms (consoles and PC's), dancing all together happily.

Additionally, Trollface is always appropriate whenever one goes to the [[circle jerk|local festival]] to check out the many [[loli|rides]].
