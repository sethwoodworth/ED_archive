Drakky
[[image:Drakky-Cheer.jpg|thumb|The furry known as Drakky.]]


'''Drakky''' is a very strange [[furry]] in the sense that he, along with a group of three to four <strike>others</strike> sockpuppet accounts, though the exact number is unknown, takes arms against his own fandom from time to time.It is intensely speculated that he does it solely for the [[lulz]], a gesture augmented by the fact that he displays his tactics for all to see. This only visually demonstrates his [[failure]]. The only funny joke about this entire page is that he started it himself. Oh wait, no, of course he didn't. <strike>[http://www.furaffinity.net/user/snow-hazard Snow Hazard]</strike> <b>NOT DRAKKY</b> created it. The real drakky only edited it for attention.

== The Fursona ==
Drakky is a <strike>human</strike> <strike>skunk</strike> <strike>falcon</strike> <strike>charmander</strike> [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|dragon]]. Actually he can't even seem to decide just what he pretends to be and constantly will assume and discard new fursonas like the used condoms from last night's [[anal_sex|friendly encounter]]. For extra lulz, ask him about this [[shit_nobody_cares_about|fact]] until he has a nervous breakdown.

== The Person ==

[[image:Drakky-bikni.jpg|thumb|Drakky doing what he does best.]]

Much about Drakky's personal life has been lost to the shadows, primarily for the fact no one has ever cared to ask him about it. He's not employed ATM, and he plans on attending school once he can stop moving from place to place in search of the perfect coon cock. His weekends are usually dedicated to [[furry]] chat sites, crossdressing and [[trolling]], primarily resulting in drama and [[antilulz]]. Also, he is acquainted with a half-fur known as Kyros. He is not to be trusted, and is very independent when it comes to making life decisions, such as getting a job (which he fails at doing because of his lack of legal identification)

Recently, he was staying with JakerzInc and his room mate, in effort to get a job to live with them, continuing his furfag ways. Unfortunately due to his ignorance, he found salvation the day he was informed of a fur meet in Jacksonville, which wherein he would whore himself out to the first furry he has hot anal sex with.

== Attack! ==
Drakky and his [[lies|crew]] work in a variety of ways. This can range anywhere from 13 year old insults and things (usually done with a [[sock puppet]] in order to get all the benefits of his trolling without his identity being discovered) to an all-out forum raid, where he is accompanied with 3 or 4 of his teammates, sometimes called "Striped" furs, whatever the hell that means. He then will post these raids and various [[shit]] on his webpage or on the forum he attacked, doubling over the [[antilulz]] generated. (Please note: He cannot actually troll. If you think his methods of trolling are [[lulz|lulzy]], then you are a [[13_year_old|fucking idiot]].)

== Teh Victims ==
Drakky claims that his favorite prey are the [[Naruto|Narutards]], the dumpy, [[retarded]] fanboys of the anime ''[[Naruto]]''. He says that he has staged various raids against these [[Obamians]] out of some kind of naive lust for troll-cred. The only real lulz that his trolling generates come from the fact that he himself is a [[Naruto|Narutard]], even designing his character to have Naruto eyes and assorted [[weeaboo]] terms. He even seems to have convinced himself that he can be a ninja in real life if he just dressed up and wishes hard enough http://www.furaffinity.net/full/1779574/ . 

The skunk also takes a particular interest in furries - a paradox in itself since trolling furries makes one a furfag. These attacks are, once again, held under the guise of a cock puppet, whilst to other members of his harem, he's an average pimp bucket who dreams of becoming [[An Hero]]. However, there are little to no accounts of Drakky ever [[yiff]]ing anything but his mom, much to the dismay of his vast library of dog dildos which are mainly room decorations. His involvement with the fandom is rather deep, and he plans to buy a fursuit to make it easier when scouting out the 60 year olds who pay a hundred bucks for crappy bjs.

Drakky actually listed his own addresses here, probably because he wants someone to talk to him for once. After all, he's a [[liar|legendary furry troll]]. Everyone reading his ED article must be desperate to talk to him.

== Known Habitats ==
Drakky can be found on the furry site YiffStar (among others) where is is usually busy typefucking anything with a pulse. He can also be found on Furnet where he sucks any male administrator's dick to get power in the IRC chats but ironically he has no authority anywhere. He will either blend into the shadows, or appear and send the other furfags reeling back, screaming [[fursecution]] and running with their tails betwixt their legs (or paws or whatever else the fuck furries have). He basically tries to troll at all times but for some reason he only ends up becoming their roleplay slaves. He works mainly in secret, said to be to avoid the full assault of a bunch of angry [[basement dwellers]] (much like himself). He's been banned from multiple places for his long-winded rants whenever a token furry starts spewing [[logic|shit]] out of his mouth, but what he fails to realize is that he was the furry that was spewing shit to begin with. Then begins the links to [[Last Measure]] and Tubgirl, or at least he imagines linking to them while he gently faps to swirling circles and dries his tears with cumrags.
