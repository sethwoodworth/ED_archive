'''[[Crap]]''', also known as hippity hop, '''R'''etards '''A'''ttempting '''P'''oetry, and sometimes '''rap''', started out as [[music]] made by black person specifically for consumption by the hip black [[community]].  [[Ironically]] (thanks to [[MTV]]), [[everybody|wiggers, Puerto Ricans, Romanians, Asians and even Jews]] make up the majority of rap fans. Rap was taken over and revamped by the middle class, but this gradually changed. This is considered highly [[offensive]] by the black community, as blacks [[nigga stole my bike|never steal anything from whites]]. Evar.

==Terrorists of Popular Music==

Black people have always dominated the charts in one way or another. [[At least 100 years ago]], blacks started to write their own songs and record music, and from the very get-go their stuff sounded ridiculous. Modern rap is no different, except in that now [[Soulja Boy|black people]] don't even bother with instruments like guitars or saxophones and instead use cheap ass, outdated samplers and drum machines stolen from local pawn shops and decent white folk.  Even with shitty equipment like this, and [[crap|low quality]] record production, they act like they have [[Hookers and blow|money, women]], cars and other material possessions. 

Sadly, there is but one thing they will never, ''ever'' possess: talent. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPX44xvUmFA This is what every rap song <del>made after 2005</del> sounds like]


==Side Effects of Listening to Rap==
[[lie|It's common knowledge]] that rappers Jew, cars, and [[Whores|ho's]] off the backs of their retarded listeners. Many [[poor|rap enthusiasts]] also suffer [[earrape|health issues]] from listening to rap. Listening to rap music instantly gives you [[AIDS]]. Even if you're a not a black, the second you listen to rap you turn into an [[AIDS]] infested black person. Not only does rap cause AIDS, but also blows your ears open and causes it's listeners to [[lol|loose]] [[over 9000|an incredible amount]] of brain cells for every second they play their music. That explains why niggers are so deaf and dumb.

==Rap and Hip Hop==
[[Image:Decline_of_civilization.jpg|thumb|right|Decline of civilization.]]
[[File:NWA - Problem, Music Industry1.jpg|thumb|NWA's trolling of the music industry still resonates today.]]

Rap's [[politically correct]] 'brother', '''Hip Hop''' was also rap's negligent parent. Although primarily considered by [[fanboy|adherents]] to be a '[[gay|lifestyle]]' and/or [[unwarranted self-importance|movement]] hip hop purports to include "[[music]]" (rap), fashion, "[[art]]", and [[dance]]. As a musical genre, '''Hip Hop''' is supposedly more thoughtful, conscious and 'cleaner' than '''Rap''' and thus [[tl;dr]] and [[shit nobody cares about]] since it promotes such ludicrous ideals as black pride, respect for the black woman and non-violence whist it denounces such things as black-on-black violence, using the word "black person",  calling any women "bitches" and all the other stereotypical trappings of the [[gangsta]] rapper's [[ghetto|'ghetto nigger']] lifestyle. 

Most '''hip hop''' 'artists' consider themselves to be more educated, enlightened and 'advanced' than other rappers and look down upon their gun-toting brethren (who sell more records in one day that they do in a career). Many black '''hip hoppers''' have also converted to [[Islam]] and take [[Arab]]ic names to show-off their [[pie]]ty. 99.9% of them are hypocrites, however, who enjoy smoking blunts, drinking Cosmopolitans and having sex with anything that moves whilst eating bacon sandwiches laced with [[X]] whenever the opportunity arises.

==/rap/==
Rap is a board on [[24chan]] where middle class [[white]] teenagers partake in gangster rap battles. The board was made by [[Eric]] after 24chan's [[insurgent]] decided to beg for it endlessly

==Rap and the Jews==

{{main|Beastie Boys}}
Many rappers, particularly those who have converted to Arab, express a personal dislike of [[Jews]]. For instance, Chuck D of Public Enemy once praised epic Jew-hater Louis Farrakhan as "a [[prophet]]" and complained that the Jews who control the media were [[pwn|crucifying]] him, just like they did to [[Jesus]]. Professor Griff, another PE member, went so far as to blame Jews for the majority of evil in the world, including unleashing "[[bling]]" culture onto black ghettoes through their [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion|control of the diamond industry]]. However, Public Enemy's first album was produced by the Jew Rick Rubin and all of the businessmen responsible for distributing their music were Jewish, revealing it all to be a staged spectacle put on by the Jews to confuse and entertain the populace.

Essentially rap music is nothing more than a plot by the Jews to convince black people that it's cool to be [[angry]] and violent [[criminals]]. Not that <s>m</s>any black people need much encouragement about that or anything.

==Enjoying Rap==

*Blacks enjoy Rap through extraordinaraly large speakers. They increase bass to make their music more obscene while purchasing blunt wraps from the local gas station.

*Whites-myself-enjoy rap with headphones, to avoid [[rape]] at the local gas station.

==Rap Dance==

[[Image:AmenBreak.gif|thumb|Even [[wiggers|white guise]] are experts at the [[amazing]] dance.]]

Some nigger: ''"[[White]] man came to our land, took us away, then [[rape|enslaved]] us, so [[you|we]] invented rap... and the rap dance".'' <br>
Nowadays, black person [[dance]], (also called [[gay|street dance]] by [[wiggers]]), is a mean of [[lame|artistic]] expression for and [[lie|against]] crime in [[black]] culture.

== Constructing the Rapper ==
[[Image:PAULWALL.jpg|thumb|right|Although the [[media]] makes him out to be one, Paul Wall is NOT a rapper.]]
[[Image:Thefreshprinceofbelair.jpg|thumb|[[Fresh Prince|One of the more hardcore artists in this genre]]]]

* [[Pimping|Hustling]]
* According to [[CNN]], many rappers are black person!
* An extensive [[criminal]] record
* Dark skin color (acceptable range: [[Black|#CD853F]] to [[black|#000000]])
* An [[Issac Hayes|annoying/deep voice]], it helps if you can sound like you perpetually have a mouthful of [[Cum|oatmeal]].
* Using a "smooth" tone of voice when talking to a "[[whore|lady]]" when in reality, you're about as smooth as sandpaper.
* Bad grammar and/or words that are [[Retard|hip]] phonetic misspellings of common words contained within your name (e.g. [[dawg]]/[[dog]]/dawwwggg, Phat, E-Z, Busta).
* A [[gang]] and/or group of other "Rappers".
* [[Lie|Acting like you can beat the shit out of absolutely anyone]].
* [[The Great Black Dick Hoax|Claiming to have a dick over 14 inches long]].
* Wearing a Gay 1980s-style color-matched [[sports]] outfit.
* Being from the [[Africa|da Hood]] or the [[Nawlins|projects]].
* Having a "grill" filled with golden teeth.
* Driving an SUV, even though the most rugged terrain it will traverse are manholes and potholes. 
* Wearing [[gold]] everything around your neck - gold clock, gold Mercedes hood ornament, gold chains; the technical dexterity of the rapper is proportionate to the cm<sup>3</sup> of gold around his or her neck.
* Trash talking about other rappers, getting shot, then doing it again because you're a masochistic dumbass.
* [[Homeless|Growing up on the streets]].
* [[GTFO|Gangbang your pecker off]].
* HURRY UP! THEY'RE ABOUT TO START THE POOL PARTY!.
* Taking a fucking gutter and whipping it down your header

=== Lifestyles of the [[Rich]] and [[Criminal]] ===

Rappers smoke overpriced [[weed|schwag]], smoke heavily cut/overpriced [[crack]], drink overpriced [[liquor]], pop [[meth]]-cut/overpriced [[X]] and generally use the [[money|dollars]] of their adoring [[fans]] to pay the bikini-clad [[black chicks|black women]] who [[strip]] for them were originally honor students at [[college]], but were kidnapped, brainwashed and are now permanent prisoners in the mansions of the hip-hop artists. 

It is also worth noting, that in order to be a rapper, you must [[hate]] white people. It is, however, acceptable if you buy overpriced brand-name products from [[whitey]], such as [[cars]] you don't know how to drive (e.g. Mercedes, Cadillac, Lamborghini, Rolls Royce, Bentley), jewelry you look like an asshole wearing (e.g. Rolex), designer clothing you trash daily (e.g. Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada) and other sophisticated things that niggers are too stupid or lazy to make.

=== Clothing ===
[[Image:Minimall.jpg|thumb|[[Flea Market Montgomery|One of the greatest rappers of all time]]]]

Hip hop apparel usually consists of dangerously baggy pants that drag on the ground and trip the rapper, boxers that are constantly visible, a 25-pound matching hooded sweatshirt, oversized brown boots, fake jewelry, $500 Air Force 1 shoes (because "they're fuckin hot kicks") and the [[ape]] inside of it all (see right). [[Wiggers]] can wear this, but their typical attire is usually wearing dark and nylons with blue flames and a lame ass [[dragon]] on the back.

Tips to Rapping Fashion

*Wear baggy clothing/Look like a complete [[Faggot|tool]]
*Claim you're the best thing since [[World War II|sliced bread]]
*Rap about [[drugs]], ([[gay]]) sex and [[Cock|failed cumshots]]
*Own a collection of flat-brimmed hats that all have DC or [[New York City|NY]] on them.
*Wear excessive cologne and grills (sometimes optional)
*Own about 2000 pairs of shoes, and never ever tie any of them.
*Talk about fabric softener behind "yo' girl"'s back.
*Wear excessive bright colors that don't match at all (such as yellow and orange together).
*Walk with your hands tucked into your jeans (which should be down to almost your fuckin ankles.
*Pretend to like sports, particularly [[sex|lacrosse]].
*Shine your shoes with your saliva.
*Shine your homeboy's shoes with saliva.
*Pretend to hate the police while at the same time show that you don't care what they think.
*Shine your homeboy's underware with saliva ( see [[Rape|Panty Lick]] )
*Pretend to be from "da hood", which is actually just a fictional place with couches on the lawn and rabid dogs.
*Find out [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|WHO THE HELL SHORTY IS]]! He's in like every freakin' rap song! Who the hell is he?

=== The Proper Title for a Rapper ===

: One who follows [[Stalin]] is called a ''Stalinist''
: One who plays guitar is called a ''guitarist''.
: One who does [[art]] is called an ''artist''.
: ''Therefore'', the proper title for one who performs rap is a '''''rappist'''''. 
:: '''QED'''.

== What Classifies As A Rap Song? ==
[[Image:Soujaboysr4.jpg|thumb|[[Soulja Boy]], your typical one <small>(s)</small>hit wonder rap artist.  Remember Sisqó? Probably not if you were born post-1990.]]

For a song to classify as rap, one must be able to identify most or all of the following elements:
* A list of [[felonies]]
* [[Ebonics]]
* [[Fuck|Swearing]] [[shit|every]] [[ass|other]] [[bitch|line]]
* Even though not in concert, you '''must''' use phrases that refer to you being in an actual concert, such as "Put ya' hands in da' air"
* Lyrics or titles containing the pseudomorph ''tha''. as in ''Tha [[Cops]] Was Aksin' Me''
* Multiple references to some sort of "hood" or "projects". (Somewhere in [[New York]] is always a good place to start.)
* Lyrics about raping white women in [[KFC]] (they were [[asking for it]] which is always the case).
* [[Police]] sirens.
* [[BAW|Singing about]] [[Poverty|hard times]]
* [[Drugs]] -- lots of drugs
** If you're from the "[[Africa|dirty South]]": Include references to trashy and [[Psychosis|psychosis-inducing]] shit like [[PCP]] and sizzurp
* Stealing other people's [[shit|work]] and mix it in with random [[bullshit|sounds]]
* [[Will Smith|The story all about how your life got flipped, turned upside down]]
* If its modern rap, have a Roland Drum machine that does a beat sample played at a bat-shit crazy tempo, and then say how you're tired of using technology. 
* A dance that involves being so low to the ground that you get trampled by a [[retard]] that is [[doing it wrong]].
* [[Bix nood|Gibberish]] 

=== Rules of Rap ===
[[Image:4chan_raper.jpg|thumb|[[Rape|Not to be confused with...]]]]

# All post-1990 rap songs are ripoffs of other songs.
# Rhyme; it's called [[Retards|'''r'''etards]] [[Failing|'''a'''ttempting]] [[poetry|'''p'''oetry]] for a reason.
# Use copious filler.
# Absolutely under no circumstances can you use a time signature other than 4/4.
# All white rappers suck, [[no exceptions]].
# [[Original Content|Originality]] is bad.
# If you're not [[pussy|gangster]], you don't belong.
# Rap about [[bitches]], hoes and tricks -- even if the only women you get are stank-ass, [[STD]]-infected [[prostitutes]].

==Creation of a Hip-Hop Song==
[[Image:NiggazInDaHood.jpg|thumb|right|225px|This must be the fabled "hood" that is spoken so much about in rap.]]
[[Image:Xzibit.jpg|thumb|[[SUP DAWG]]]]

First a music producer goofs around on a cheap Casio keyboard. You know, the kind you could pick up for five bucks at a flea market and has old leaked batteries inside of it and sticky juice-stained keys. Around 45 seconds later, the proper beat and tempo is found. Then the artist starts rapping some half-assed poetry about his clothes, slutty women shaking their stinky asses, lame double-endantres, acting like a total [[moron]] at a club, and his watermelon harvest. The producer may add in a sampled melody of some unpopular Alan Parsons Project song. And that's how a hip-hop song is made.  If that's too advanced for you, we here at ED have created a handy guide:

# First, you must create a TOTALLY PIMPED-OUT and preferably illogical pseudonym because regular old names are too boring for today’s X-TREME generation.
# You must write songs about highly innovative and original topics such as [[sex]], [[drugs]], [[violence]], [[money]], [[women]], and nightclubs to establish yourself as a [[fag|totally unique individual]] because those topics have never been written about before or even discussed for that matter. Remember, nobody likes a poser!  Also make sure to be sexist and racist towards white people.
# When you write a song, go for style and not substance! Make sure you rhyme as many times as you can. Don’t worry about sacrificing the coherence of your message to all your forced rhyming; there’s no substitute for [[gay|kool]]!!! In fact, the more incoherent your song is, the better. See [[Riding Dirty]] for inspiration!  Also [[swearing|curse]] a lot.  Make sure to say [[fuck]], [[shit]], [[bitch]], [[hoe]], black person, [[ass]], [[dick]], [[pussy]], [[piss]] or muthafucka every other line. You are trying WAY too hard if the chorus of your song contains more than 5 different words.
# Make sure to repeatedly lace your lyrics with random vocal interjections such as “uh-huh,” “yeah,” “dat's right,” and most recently "ballin" to remind everyone that you’re totally off the hook. Of course, these meaningless vocal spasms of shite ''do not'' serve to the fill the void when you can’t think of more substantial things to rap about...
# Don't even bother about singing because that takes talent and effort. Just talk in somewhat of a rhythm—occasionally. Speak normally the rest of the time. Make certain that you butcher the English language as much as you can. Never speak correctly. That's not being totally pimp, yo!
# Turn on the radio to a rock station. Listen for a catchy guitar riff and record it. Synthesize it, and alter it slightly. Loop it about 100+ times and you have your [[bullshit|VERY OWN, NON-PLAGIARIZED RAP SONG]]! Next, drop [[random]] samples of [[police]] sirens and loading [[guns]] to show everyone that you're a bad-ass rebel. Then give yourself a cookie.
# Don't forget to put a picture of a hot woman on your CD cover to compensate for your lack of hot women in the real world. Also, do it to boost the sales of your CD because you know your shit sucks, and is hence likely to attract the sort of [[basement dweller|crowd]] liable to use it for a cheap [[wank]].
# Sit on your [[lazy]], [[narcissistic]] ass and let other people who are more competent and talented than you mix, produce, print and publish the album.
#??????????
# [[PROFIT]]!

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' It is impossible for a rap "song" to be by just one rapper. It's a little known [[fact]] that every rap song features [[at least 100]] other rappers, most of whom are unknown. In fact, the majority of every rap CD does not feature the actual rapper itself.

==Anatomy of a Rap Song==

For the Jews to make any money of this garbage, they have a systematic formula that both sells albums and retards the middle class. It also has the ability to make you "uncool" for seeing it for what it really is: THE SAME STUPID SHIT - EVERY FUCKING TIME. Top men have been studying this for years and have finally broke it down. Be warned, however: If you enjoy rap music, and still do after seeing this - You might be retarded. Only your physician can tell.

# Start out with a single loop. Every fucking rap song in existence is in a 4/4 time signature, which is due to the fact that its all that's covered in the instruction manual that came with the equipment they stole and that niggers can't comprehend music theory in general. The initial loop is going to continue the whole song, so make it "good"! PROTIP: Rip off a song that's already been famous. Rule of thumb: Whatever that song made when it was released will be multiplied by the current cost of living in record sales(which in a nigger's case is only about as big as his welfare check, but you'd surprised. Their record label will keep all the money anyway. It's probably owned by Dr. Dre.) 
# Just before the beat comes in, scream your fucking name, then scream the DJ's name, then scream your label's name. The more name's you can fit in the beginning of the song will determine how much people will give a crap when your shit sampler destroys EVERYTHING REAL MUSICIANS WORK FOR. Example: "LIL (insert name)! FEATURING (misspell something then misspell your name) AND DJ (someone no one knows).
# After shouting over 9000 names, give a shout out to who your target audience is. Since it's niggers and suburban kids who wish they were niggers, it's probably going to be somewhere where poor people live. For added lulz, tell them how you contributing to social growth and society in general. Example: "Doin' it beeeg n da dirty south dawgs keepin' it real! for all my homies an shawtys word!"
# Beat comes in; again, it's 4/4 time signature. As long as the bass is up all the way, it could be a chimp farting on a snare drum and it will still get played in the club. BE SURE TO INCLUDE GUN SHOTS AND POLICE SIRENS. Without them, you're not baller. And no one will take you serious if it doesn't sound like someone was being shot when you recording this. Statistics show that most gunshots on rap songs were actually fired during recording.
# Here comes the easy part: LYRICS! Basically, to efficiently write rap songs, templates are available. Each record company has their own, and they work similar to Mad Libs. Just fill in the blanks and your good to go! Make up words for extra points! EXAMPLE: (PROPER NOUN) BE (VERB) CAUSE I LOOK SO (ADJECTIVE); (NOUN) WANNA (VERB) ME WHEN I (VERB) THEIR (NOUN). Since black people can't understand English, it actually makes it better for some reason. No one knows why. It's probably because if you're stupid enough to like it, you're stupid enough to understand it.
# Write your hook! It has to be about one of the following:
*Looking good.
*How cool your car is.
*How easy it is to get women.
*How much money you make.
*How nice your clothes are.
*How jealous others are of you.
*How great you are.
*How great your neighborhood is.
*Represent someplace.
*Represent something tragic that happened to you. (It has to happen to black people for this to be taken seriously, because if it happened to white people the government would stepped in and helped because THEY DON'T SELF PERPETUATE NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES ABOUT THEY'RE PEOPLE FOR PROFIT. Yea, That's what rap is.)

Basically, just lie. It's not like you have anything to prove anyhow. Since it sounds like something someone already did, it's going to sell.
# INSERT HORRIBLE FEMALE SINGER NO ONES EVER HEARD OF NOA! The less known the better! That way, while she's fucking you for a shot at fame, she might make it really big and in the meantime and insure your future as well! Better start hitting the strip clubs! PROTIP: Make them spell something. This shows that she actually got learned in her edumacation.
# After repeating the hook over 9000 times, repeat step 1 until you run out of memory on your stolen Acer laptop. 
# Burn to CD or your Zune (also stolen.)
# FUCKING FAMOUS.

==Music Videos==

[[File:Snoopfrog.gif|thumb|Every rap video ever]]
If the song is about love (e.g. "I love da way you shake dat ass" in the chorus), then the music video will include scenes of the rapper in question cheating on his girlfriend and then winning her back by giving her a new necklace or diamond ring or something similar. These scenes will be, of course, intercut with clips of the rapper and his "crew" sitting in a hot tub with bikini-clad women.
Little did you know that Snoop dog has a lighter softer side.
