Nouglybabies
It all started innocently enough. Women post pics of their newborn babies and then seek some sort of approval/validation from other freaks on LJ. Sure, that may be pathetic, but it's not really different from 98% of the other ratings communities on LJ.

== Owen Ray Pugface ==
Enter poor Owen Ray Kolicinzki, son of {{lj|user=twinklinlilstar}}.

In about 20 years, we expect him to either kill and eat people he picks up on the freeway or blow up large federal buildings to promote his manifesto.

Several months after the original Pugface drama, twinklinlilstar filed a dmca complaint against [[hardvice]] for the photoshop of Puggy with [[ohbutyouwillpet]], leading hardvice to use his troll account, [[poko_fister]] while the claim was pending.  When twinklinlilstar failed to file suit within the time specified by the statute, [[LJ Abuse]] restored hardvice's account and gave him permission to use the image as much as he likes on LiveJournal.

== The Famous Frozen Waffle Drama ==
Already well into its stride as one of the most [[drama]]-laced LJ communities of all time, the [[shit]] really hit the fan when {{lj|user=surprise_raisin}} posted [http://www.livejournal.com/community/nouglybabies/44940.html an application] (images baleeted) including a picture of her kid teething on a frozen waffle.  The entire thread exploded into chaos as the [[pop parenting]] [[Nazi]]s flipped out while various [[dramacrat]]ic [[troll]]s came in to increase the hate&mdash;including one of [[rfjason]]'s [http://www.livejournal.com/community/nouglybabies/44940.html?thread=1073548#t1073548 finest performances], wherein he wished an operating table fatality on his opponent.  The comments carried on for three pages, and the frozen waffle became a bit of an inside joke among the community members who are smart enough to remember that the whole community is a joke.
