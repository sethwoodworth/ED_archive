Not to be confused with [[Evildoer Korea]], '''Good Korea''' (or combined as one word is [[Gorea]]) is a friend of all peace-loving, patriotic people. They make good stuff, but not as good as our stuff, and they sell it cheaply so that our importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers can all mark it up for huge profits. In this way they make capitalism work and democracy thrive. Good Korea was one of the [[United States]]' 20th century acquisitions in accordance with the long-term [[Manifest Destiny]]. 

==Geography==
Good Korea is immediately south of [[Evildoer Korea]], on the bottom half of a peninsula that is west of [[Japan]]. It has water on both sides. It is a very convenient place for throwing things into [[Evildoer Korea]]. It used to have some good surf beaches, but now they are rather untidy.

People living in Good Korea are called [[Gorean]]s.  There are millions of Asians there, but they all make Samsungs, Kias or other stuff that is good but not too good. Because they are not [[fag|Evildoers]], we allow them to eat and don't shoot them very much. When not working or eating kimchi and squid, Good Koreans spend most of their time engaging in popular [[ancient]] Korean pastimes such as getting numerous [[Michael Jackson|plastic surgeries]], drinking some kind of watered down vodka bullshit, playing ''[[Starcraft]]'', [[Fan death|dodging fans]], and [[Virginia Tech massacre|shooting up schools]].

Like [[Korea|Neutral Korea's]] music which comes in two forms [[JROCK|jrock]] and [[JROCK|other jrock]], there are two types of Korean music [[crap|kpop]] and [[crap|krap]]. Coincidentally or not, one of the music styles is a bastardized spelling of what it actually sounds like.

All the men are [[drunk]]s and all the women are scared of you and want to marry you. [http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/home/regularieninhalte/world-news-ticker/news,rendertext=11719438.html Children are starved to death while their parents raise virtual childs, srsl]

Culturally, Koreans, both Good and Evildoers, have a special ability to take other people's fucked up ideas four thousand steps too far. Look at what they did with Confucianism, what the Evildoer Koreans are doing with [[socialism]], or at how fucked up the Good Korean [[Christians]] are; missionary work in [[Afghanistan]], who came up with that idea? And who can forget their [[Starcraft|national sport]] where they strip mine planets for vespene gas so then can build millions of pylons then zerg rush each other into oblivion.

If you are planning a trip to Korea, why not try [[raping]] one of their women?  As the [[Japanese]] Prime Minister knows, they are really [[asking for it]].

== Government ==

Good Korea is owned and ruled in its entirety by Hyundai Corporation. Hyundai's employees and employee's families are led to believe they also have some local political leaders who aren't very interesting and speak a foreign language.

==Economy==
You can make a lotta lotta money in Good Korea. Make sure your mutual funds and IRAs include Good Korean companies. If you can't get a job where you are despite owning a suit, you can be a highly paid English-speaking [[monkey]] to entertain their small children. Many Good Koreans might be confused because [[white people]] (like Alan Alda and Jamie Farr) look good in movies and [[you]] don't. But don't worry! They will never fire you no matter how fat, gross, diseased, and lazy you are. And don't forget, although [[Raelian|RaÃ«l]] may be [[Perma-ban|banned]] in Korea, he still needs your 10 percent.

Internationally, Good Korea releases [[MMORPG]]s for free, which are usually awful, even by MMORPG standards. Kids will actually pay for extra, useless features on this shit, which will normally make their character look more like a [[fag]] or [[weeaboo]]. The profit Good Korea makes on this  faggotry is uncertain, though it could be over 20% of their economy.

[[Image:Japracist.jpg|thumb|Unlike [[Japan|this]] sign, this only exists in Japan and Taiwan.]]

Gorea is trying to take over the world by making and releasing free shitty gay TV Drama + K-poop featuring post-plastic-surgery pretty boys and girls, but no one gave a shit except for a few pathetic [[Koreaboo]]s in South East Asia.

==US Military in Good Korea==
If you are serving in the military, please take advantage of the many prostitutes that populate the red light district.  Remember, though:  Koreans hate any and all United States soldiers, so avoid asking questions, unless you would like to contribute to the Korean national pastime (other than ''Starcraft''): Blankly staring and giggling.

It is a known fact that [[Cho Seung-Hui|a Korean cannot kill more than 33 people without killing him or herself.]]
