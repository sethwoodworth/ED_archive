Honestly, I don't see why KirbysLover is even allowed on the [[internets]], if half the shit she posts is true.

10. Bubsy - <i>Parody of Maybe, as performed by Andrea McArdle (Original Soundtrack of the Broadway Musical, "Annie")</i> -- KirbysLover's tribute to Bubsy Bobcat, long before her dismissal of the series of poorly conceived games for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and PlayStation game consoles. Courtesy of [[ED]].

11. Camera Shy - <i>Parody of Butterfly, as performed by Smile DK</i> -- This parody explains KirbysLover's shyness around cameras.

12. Christmas Without One Piece - <i>Parody of Silent Night, as performed by various artists</i> -- KirbysLover's tale of her parents forever banning her from ever watching One Piece again. (one of the more pathetic titles)

17. If You Love the Hedgehog (He Will Run Free) - <i>Parody of If You Love Someone (Set Them Free), as performed by Sting (Gordon Summer)</i> -- Yet another tribute to the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games.

18. Introduction - Not a parody, but more so a rip of the Wallace and Gromit theme tied with a dance beat at the end. (non-vocal)

19. Lemmings - <i>Parody of Five Senses, as performed by Hi-5</i> -- a parody about the Lemmings games from the 1990's.

20. Luffy, My Love - <i>Paordy of The Rose, as performed by Bette Midler</i> -- KirbysLover announces her love to Monkey D. Luffy in song.

23. Nightmare at Strand! - <i>Parody of Bad Day, as performed by Daniel Powter</i> -- a parody of KirbysLover's trip to seeing A Bug's Life going horribly awry, after panicking over Flick being ostracized from his colony. <i>Note:  The toy piano in the backing track only makes this one less enjoyable.</i>

24. Piñata Island - <i>Parody of I Can See Clearly Now, as performed by Jimmy Nash</i> -- Yet another filk song, but of the XBox 360 game,  Viva Piñata.

25. Professor Pester - <i>Parody of She Hates Me, as performed by Puddle of Mudd</i> -- a filk song about the Viva Piñata lead villain, Professor Pester.

26. Professor Pester's (Bad) Touch - <i>Parody of Bad Touch, as performed by the Bloodhound Gang</i> -- yet another filk song about Professor Pester and his ruffians.  <i>Note:  There are three known versions of this song:  Demos A and B, along with the official release.</i>

27. Raving Rabbids - <i>Possibly the first and only original song that KirbysLover has ever written and recorded!</i> -- This original is a "style parody" to the musical stylings of Wesley Willis.  Believe this or not, but this original recording does nail Wesley Willis's style spot on!  <i>Note:  While this is the only original she's ever produced, make note that a looped backing track, in one key does not make a good backing track!</i>

28. Rayman (It's Not Easy) - <i>Parody of Superman (It's Not Easy), as performed by Five for Nothing</i> -- a parody/filk song about the PC version of Rayman.

29. Realistic - <i>Parody of Ironic, as performed by Alanis Morissette</i> -- Yet another song about Sonic the Hedgehog, rather, KirbysLover's difficulty of aknowledging that Sonic the Hedgehog is A FICTIONAL CHARACTER!

32. Shadow of a Doubt - <i>Parody of Dragostea Din Tei, as performed by O-Zone</i> -- KirbysLover desperately tries to immitate the Romanian pop group.  The piece, rather, the song in question tributes Dr. Eggman and Shadow the Hedgehog. <i>Note:  There are two known versions of this song, one being a demo version and the other being the official release.</i>

33. Shadow Scared Me Tonight - <i>Parody of Another Day in Paradise, as performed by Phil Collins</i> -- KirbysLover sings of a panic attack after watching Sonic X. <i>At first, basing the parody on its title, one would assume that she would be parodying Sir Elton John's "Someone Saved My Life Tonight".</i>

34. Shadow the Hedgehog - <i>Parody of Frosty the Snowman, as performed by various artists</i> -- a tribute to Shadow the Hedgehog.

35. Sonic Advet - <i>Parody of Away in a Manger, as performed by various artists</i> -- One of two parodies of traditional, religious songs about Sonic the Hedgehog.

36. Starbucks Double-Shots - <i>Parody of Gummy Berry Juice, as performed by Disney's Gummi Bears</i> -- KirbysLover's song about the Starbucks Double-Shot.  KirbysLover shouldn't really be drinking caffeinated beverages.

37. The Lost Vikings - <i>Parody of Three Wishes, as performed by Hi-5</i> -- A tribute to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System's game title, the Lost Vikings.

38. The Story of Wario Ware, Inc. - <i>Parody of The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, as performed by Gordon Lightfoot</i> -- KirbysLover's historical telling of how Wario Ware, Inc. came to be.

39. Wario World - <i>Parody of Part of Your World, as performed by Ariel, from Disney's the Little Mermaid</i> -- KirbysLover sings about how she'd like to play Wario World for the Nintendo Game Cube.

40. We Parted Ways - <i>Parody of 2 Become 1, as performed by the Spice Girls</i> -- The parody is mainly about KirbysLover playing Conker's Bad Fur Day and various Rareware titles and her rant of Microsoft buying out Rareware.

41. What a Friend We Have in Sonic - <i>Parody of What a Friend We Have in Jesus, as performed by various artists</i> -- Believe this or not, but this song, by far has the most disturbing lyrics -- apparently, KirbysLover thinks it's okay to pray to Sonic the Hedgehog and worship him.  <i>(i.e. "Take it to the 'hog in prayer...")</i>  <b>Additional Comment:</b> Lyrics can be found [http://www.weirdalforum.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=4714&st=512&#entry339636 here].
