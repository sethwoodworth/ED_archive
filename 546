Anti-Americanism refers to anyone or anything that is not part of the [[United States]], disagrees with the status quo, or doubts the doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]] or just wants to shit on george bush's face. More broadly, if you consider yourself an [[American]], you can use this term to refer to anyone who disagrees with you on any issue.

==The Drama Unfolds==
Anti-Americanism is a potent force for generating [[retarded]] drama. Not even [[ED]] itself can escape its idiocy. In fact, [[some argue|studies show]] that 99.999% of ED users who encounter this page take damage to their IQ, which ends up making their already incoherent, rambling edits even more moronic.

==Causes of Anti-Americanism==
[[Image:Anti-American cant spell.jpg|thumb|right|Much anti-Americanism is generated from the fact Americans cant fukin spell.]]
*Fear: Because America is taking over teh [[World]].
*Jealousy: Because America is way better than your [[Mexico|shitty country]].
*Revulsion: Because Americans know America is better than your [[France|shitty country]] and are [[Fucktard|assholes]] about it.
*Evolution: Because the sludge on Earth coalesced into a machine capable of understanding.
*Peer Pressure: Because your friends hate America too.
*Idiocy: Because Americans know how to properly conjugate words such as deserve, as well as win most Nobel Prizes.

==A Possible Solution==

Denial, ask the haters: "[[Why do you hate America?]]". Or even consider talking about it using foreign arguments.

===Haz Arguments===
*'''[[Eurofag]] / [[Asian]] argument''':
**A [[truthfag|fact]] or assertion offered as clarification.

*'''[[French]] / [[Latin]] Argumentum''':
**A variable in a logical or [[Theoretical physics|mathematical]] [[emo|expression]] whose value determines the dependent variable.

*'''[[Brit]]ish argument''':
**A discussion in which reasons are advanced for and against some proposition or proposal.

*'''[[American]]istic argument''':
**Forpay of gun fight.
**Anything that kills rational discussion [[dead]].
