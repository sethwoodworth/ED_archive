WolfJLupus
[[Image:wolfjlupus4.jpg|thumb|WolfJLupus, after a long night of having Cody's knot stuck up his ass and telling the trolls they need to get lives in no less than 100 comments.]]

'''WolfJLupus''', also known as '''Jeremy Wilton''' is the premiere [[troll]]ing [[faggot]] of the internet [[bestiality]] community.  When not taking it [[Anal sex|in the ass]] from a mighty dogcock, he can usually be found defending the rights of [[furries]] to hump whatever pet or barnyard animal they like.  There is no comment about him that goes unanswered by his high school-dropout rapier-sharp [[netspeak]].

==Bestiality==

[[Image:ontherun.jpg|thumb|right|A day in the life of wolfjlupus.]]

WolfJLupus is a very vocal [[zoophile]], to the point that his fellow dogfuckers distance themselves from him in fear of publicity.  He has lost a good number of pets and "animal friends" to his animal abuse, but doesn't fully realize it. His stances and goals are very similar to that of [[User_talk:Christopher|Christopher]], though he resents the comparison because of his [[fursecution]] complex.

==Recipe for lulz==

When you question WolfJLupus' "zoo logic," he immediately launches into a careful plan of attack that will no doubt result in your [[Intellectual checkmate|internet defeat]]:

#Argue that your logic is [[I go chop your dollar|chopped]] because the [[SCIENCE|scientific]] method doesn't take his [[magick|wolfmagick]] [[telekinesis|telepathy]] into account.
#Argue that your morals are obsolete, and that the comparison to [[pedophiles]] is [[truth|unfair]].
#Claim that [[Wut|a bark is informed consent]], therefore bestiality is not [[rape]].
#Claim that you're "ignorant" and "closeminded" because you've never experienced [[sick fuck|hot, sweet dog snooch]] -- any amount of pet experience is nothing compared to where his penis has been.
#Invite you to his journal to [[Cybersex|continue the conversation]].
#Sick his verbose dogfucker friends on you to try and prop up his Swiss cheese arguments.
#Spend hours arguing how you have [[Hypocrite|no life]].
#Label you a [[troll]], and proceed to "[[Anti-lulz|anti-troll]]" you with nonsense.
#[[Ban]] you when he can't win the argument, and declare e-[[victory]].
#Dedicate an {{lj|user=ant1tro11}} entry to you, showcasing your ultimate [[Win|defeat]].
#Declare further e-[[victory]] while shoving a gigantic, flaming [[Zeta toy]] in his anus.

==BIG.PNG LOLLERCAUST '07==
In the early morning of March 16, 2007, known internet troll and general asshole [[User:RedMachineD|Red Machine D]], after dealing with a furry at work, fired a blindside opening shot against WolfJLupus by posting a 50 [[PNG|BIG PNG]] post in the comments section of WolfJLupus' livejournal. No reason was given for this [[lulz|terroristic]] attack, except for a comment previously posted by Mr. D talking about Arizona jails and ending with "FURRY HOLOCAUST 2007".

Upon seeing this, it allegedly took WolfJLupus nearly two hours to be able to access his comments section, but when he did, he erased the [[lulz]] and [[banned]] Mr. D. Undeterred, D then torpedoed WolfJLupus' email account with a flood of copypasta emails and an anonymous post on his LJ with an estimated [[Over_9000|9001]] embedded instances of BIGPNG.

==The Awesome Hidden Page of Awesomeness==

[[Image:Wasting_your_time.jpg|thumb|300px|right|WolfJLupus is wasting <s>his bandwidth</s> your time (also lol at his puny .22, what a fag)]]
In September 2006 an ultra-mysterious <s>[http://www.wjlupus.com/PRIVATE/private/secrets/ secret area]</s> BAWWWLEETED popped up on WolfJLupus's web server.
This SUPAR SECKRIT SITE has a bajillion subdirectories which are supposed to frustrate the monolithic anti-furry conspiracy endlessly, which means you can find the right directory after leaving web-spidering software running in the background for maybe an hour (wasting none of your time and lots of his bandwidth).
Buried within the subdirectories (specifically, <s>[http://www.wjlupus.com/PRIVATE/private/secrets//z003nd1n9/41337/]</s> MOAR BAWWLEETION -- that's right, wolfie boy thinks he's [[Leet|1337]]) is an incredibly secret link!
Proceeding to <s>[http://www.wjlupus.com/PRIVATE/private/secrets//z003nd1n9/41337/FuckingDeadDeer.jpg the prize]</s> <i>(Guess)</i> nets you the picture shown.
[[Lulz|LOL]] I GUESS YOU SHOWED US [[Fat|CHUNKY CHEEKS]], [[GG]]
