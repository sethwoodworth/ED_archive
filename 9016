{{Spoiler|Wickerpedia only actually has [http://www.wickerpedia.org/wiki/Wicker/ one article]}}
{{Spoiler|Wickerpedia is not actually a [[Wiki]]}}

'''[http://www.wickerpedia.org Wickerpedia]''' is a [[funny]] parody of [[Wikipedia]].  Apparently, the purveyors of Wickerpedia believe that replacing every instance of ''wiki'' by ''wicker'' is fucking brilliant. It is.  Nothing will ever reach the depths of comedic goodness that is Wickerpedia.  Depending on a singular meme is major league. The only people who think that this lousy excuse for [[lulz]] generation is funny are [[everyone]].

{{quote|Wicker is any sort of hard woven plant fiber. It can be part of a plant, such as the cores of rattan stalks, or the whole thickness, as with willow switches. Wickerwork originated from stake-frame basketry. Wicker is usually used for baskets or furniture.

The oldest surviving pieces of wicker furniture date from the Egyptian Empire. These pieces include chests made of reed and rush, wig boxes of reed and papyrus, and wicker hassocks and chairs. The popularity of wicker in America began around 1850 and is today beginning to find itself in a rebirth of popularity.

The word wicker is believed to be of Scandinavian origin: wika which means to bend in Swedish, and vikker meaning willow. Wicker is not a material in itself, but rather an overall classification of furniture woven from any one of a variety of materials.|2=Wickerpedia|color=silver|size=360%}}
