'''Blackbird''' is a [[Browser|web browser]] created by [[Obama]] in an attempt to one up [[Al Gore]], who created the [[internets]]. It is available for both [[Retards|Windows]] and [[Faggots|Macs]], and is designed around the [[prison|African-American community]].

The browser is essentially a [[stolen|redesigned]] version of [[Firefox]] with many of the same features; however, unlike Firefox, only the left hand side is shown, as [[Civil Rights|black people do not have rights]].

It should be noted that nobody uses this browser, as not only are they not people, but also because There are no black people on the Internet.

==Features==
[[File:blackbackground.png|thumb|Black videos]]

This browser has a wide arsenal of features, ranging from black search to job search. Seeing as [[Negros|blacks]] do not work, the first search is in fact broken, and the second unused. Another feature is black videos (pictured right). The range of these videos vary from a charcoal gray to onyx black, though it should be noted that there are some examples of smoky black. The black news ticker is a toolbar that shows the latest news, ranging from new [[KFC]] stores to [[shit nobody cares about]]. A local business search has been implemented that says the location, stocks and closing time of businesses around a location. The social networking feature allows members to organize activities, such as [[gang rape|gang rapes]] and [[theft|bank robberies]]. Arguably, the most successful feature is the email capabilities. This feature enables one to [[419 Nigerian Email Scams|send emails to their friends]].

Being a [[clone]] of Firefox, there is extension support. An example of an extension, which is recommended by Blackbird, is SkipScreen, which will make easier to steal copyrighted content online. No surprises there.

Blackbird is also [[Web 2.0]] compatible.

==Differences from Firefox==
Blackbird is black. Firefox is gray.
