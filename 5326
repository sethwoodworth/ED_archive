== Metal Slug, The Bullet ==
A wonderful invention best known for making war more efficient and enabling people around the world to become [[an hero]] conveniently and easily. They usually come into a wide variety of shape and shiny colors, which make them great collector item, backup dildo (have you ever rammed up a 40mm grenade up your butt ? [[So cash|Shit is so cash]]) or defensive tools (though they all suck in their own way, for more information on how to troll someone's favorite bullet, go [[gun|there]]).

== Metal Slug, The Arcade Game Series ==
''Metal Slug'' is the only 90s [[arcade]] game series worth playing. It is one of the only series that allows you to [[pwn]] zombies, [[azn]]s, Arab, aliens and wannabe [[nazi]]s occasionally all in the same game. Teh game is composed of 85% [[EPIC WIN]] and 23.5% Dr. Pepper.

===The Graphics===
[[Image:Ms_fio.jpg]]

The games are also known for their amazing graphics, thanks to '''every single action''' having [[over 9,000]] frames of animation, which of course makes it awesome. You see everybody running in a super-smooth running cycle? Awesome, isn't it? You see that hippie in his skivvies unfolding that sheet to give some crap to you? Man, that was the best unfolding I've ever seen. Hey dawg, check out that guy crouching. Not even I could crouch that realistically. Ah man, that is some tight idle stance! Dude, you know how Sonic the Hedgehog has that thing where he gets all uppity at you for being lazy? That is GARBAGE compared to this.

=== The Story ===
Basically you consistently go right, <s>cutting, shooting, and blowing up</s> [[spam]] [[rape|raeping]] anything that moves. The enemy forces are led by some [[butthurt]] wannabe [[Hitler]] who looks too much like Saddam to get away with it. He eventually gets [[rape|raped]] [[in the ass]] by [[retarded]] aliens and rescued just before getting tentacle-raped by their [[HUEG]] overlord. Luckily you get to rescue guys who keep [[penis|huge guns]] in their underwear and happily [[in the ass|give it to you]] in return for saving them from being [[almost raped]].
