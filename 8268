[[The Mole]] is [[Argent009]]'s [[Sockpuppet]] of the ruination-legal type.  Argent009 goes on it every night to vent to make it sound as if he has authority over [[ED]], so sayeth our team of [[E-Psychiatrist]]s.  True to his [[retard|incompetent nature]], he couldn't have made it more obvious. He is the only person on [[YouTube]] with a personal vendetta against the "kids" at [[ED]].

He [[delete]]d it from his forum, but it was too late.
