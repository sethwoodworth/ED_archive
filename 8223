On December 3, 2007, [[Web 2.0|Interweb 2.0]] moguls [[SixApart]] announced that they had sold their popular blogging site, [[LiveJournal]], to a [[Russia|Bolshevik]] media company called [[Упячка|SUP Fabrik]].

[http://news.livejournal.com/104520.html It begins]...

Half of LiveJournal's users have freaked out due to fear of the gulag, while the other half have proclaimed that Russian laws would grant them all the free [[shota]] and music they wanted. Of course, since the servers will be staying in San Francisco, and the same people will be running things, nothing at all will actually change -- but LJ users aren't going to let a little thing like ''facts'' stop them from going into full drama mode.

User {{lj|jayspec}} swung right into the fray with a [http://news.livejournal.com/104520.html?thread=65934408#t65934408 totally reasonable list of concerns]: {{quote|I'm sorry, I never post in these ridiculous wank-fest threads, but this could seriously be the worst thing that could ever happen to Live Journal.

Freedom of Speech as we know it on Live Journal is over. And I don't mean fandom wank slash fiction freedom of speech, I mean real, political, "founders intentions" freedom of speech.

Critics of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin have been imprisoned, gunned down by government thugs, and when they managed to escape the increasingly Czarist Russia, they've been poisoned by radiation while living abroad. This government doesn't abide criticism. And if you think it behaves any better to Russian companies it doesn't like, well, just ask what happened to Gazprom.

I don't care what kind of commitment SUP has to LJ, or how separate a company under "American Laws" Live Journal, Inc. might be. If it's a decision between "have LJ, USA delete that post critical of Vladimir Putin" and "spend a year in the gulag", I think I know what anyone at SUP is going to choose.|jayspec, who knows because of his [[common knowledge|geopolitical learnings]]|color=#7EC0EE}}

==The Advisory Board==
Knowing that most of the plebes would be placated if "one of their own" were part of the new regime, SUP in their finite wisdom has set up an "Advisory Board," otherwise known as ''I could do a better job than '''them'''''.
{{quote|The Advisory Board will also include two members from the LiveJournal community who will be elected by you (we've been inspired by the Wikipedia elections), the users.|SUP|color=#7EC0EE}}
By taking a page from [[TOW]], SUP is only going to replicate TOW-style admin drama on a scale that would make [[Jimbo Wales|Jimbo]] piss himself. Few will object to the appointment of LJ founder [[Brad]], but even fewer will be able to agree on any possible candidate for the other adviser position.

==Moar totally rational thoughts==
