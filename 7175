As far as we know, this is his real account.}}

{{youtube2|SUPERCOOLWILLOW|SUPERCOOLWILLOW}} '''John''' is one of the [[internet]]'s rare hidden gems. He appears to be a 22 year old, gap toothed [[retard]] residing in [[Britain]], being forced to sing songs found in popular culture at gunpoint, possibly by his [[pimp]]. Ian is notable for being an enigma wrapped in a pickle wrapped in another enigma, sandwiched between two more riddles, and stuffed into a mystery, and finally wrapped up again in a big box of [[hurr|HURR.]]

[[Some argue]] that SUPERCOOLWILLOW is actually a test to get into heaven. You have to watch all of his videos without so much as a smirk on your face to succeed. [[No one]] has succeeded yet.

Prepare for the laughs, although when you do laugh you feel like a [[sick fuck]]. But don't be too hard on yourself, because c'mon, even God's laughing about it.

==Testimonials==

You can't get a more dedicated fanbase than the one this slack-jawed faggot has acquired over the past few days or so. ED will either make or break his 'career', although all signs point towards breaking it. Expect [[an hero]] section within the coming days.

As Ian spends the vast majority of his day on [[YouTube]] deleting any comment that is even remotely negative towards him, you may want to check out the [http://www.youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&v=jS1iE5XxCV8 comments] on his Lonely video, as above, on his friend's account.  I think that it's safe to say that only these un-censored responses reflect the true feelings that the general public have for the [[GTFO|talent]] that is Ian.

==The Ian Philosophy==
Ian is regularly bombarded with abuse when people comment his [[Shit|amazing vocal abilities]] and [[Basement-dweller|musical prowess]], but those who love his videos are quick to step in, defend his honor and [[Shitting_dick_nipples|pwn]] all with the 'Ian Philosophy'. It basically consists of the following:

'''1.)''' Ian is a horrible singer who butchers songs found in popular culture.

'''2.)''' But he has the balls to actually post videos of himself attempting to sing these songs on YouTube.

'''3.)''' You don't have any videos of your fat ass attempting to sing [[Faggots|The Darkness]].

'''4.)''' Therefore he's actually an amazing singer, since he has the [[balls]] and you don't.

'''5.)''' ????

'''6.)''' PROFIT!

==[[A challenger appears|A Challenger Appears]]==

Although YouTube isn't known for vloggers with the even remotest element of shame, 2008 looks like YouTube will hit an all time low by inflicting us with [[moar]] talentless fucks.

Here we have [[inbred|Natalie Sicard]] (aka GOOGLEMAPPER), who is a [[Mexican|illegal immigrant]] and is Ian's [[Bullshit|girlfriend]], all together now...ahhhhhh!  The fact that they've never met doesn't seem to get in the way of this gruesome twosome & they seem [[Lulz|well suited]], perhaps even sharing the same strait-jacket? She also like to put [[lies|Pro Singer]] in her singing videos

<center>Notice - [[bullshit|"Pro Singers"]] 6 seconds in</center>

As the spirit of [[April Fools Day]] hit Youtube, SUPERCOOLWILLOW and NathalieSicard [[fail|attempted]] to increase the [[lulz|lulz]] with their cover of Apologize. The [[The_Jewnited_States_of_Americunts|US government]] countered by classifying it a WMD.
