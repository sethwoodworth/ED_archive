[[Wilford Brimley|John Bolton]] is a former [[United Nations]] ambassador for [[USA|Amerikkka]], and is currently an '80s pop musician. He is best known, however, for his illustrious acting career, reaching its pinnacle with his role as Buffalo Bob in Silence of the Lambs.  Born [[at least 100 years ago]], he is known for his various movie roles, but, more importantly, his years of Quaker Oats commercials.  He's also responsible for the ballad "Said I Loved You, But I Lied."  He allegedly became a [[sell out]] when he cut his hair and gained weight.

During his political career he was widely condemned for his cheap debating tactics, such as using his snow-white mustache to dazzle his opponents, the intensity of the dazzle being exacerbated by his ability to make his face go extremely red on command.
