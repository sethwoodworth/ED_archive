Scilon Basestar
{{crap}}

A [[Scilon]] Basestar is where various models of Scilon are manufactured, regenerated when under a billion year SeaOrg contract, and convert normal humans into robotic manure spreaders.  There are many Scilon Basestars worldwide, with the most infamous being the [[placentafag|Celebrity]] Centers and Gold Base, the home of [[Scientology]] operations. Some Basestars cost millions of dollars and generate millions more in revenue from [[dumbass|devout]] [[retard|followers]] while others are found at the intersection of [[Fail]] Road and [[Crack]] Alley.
