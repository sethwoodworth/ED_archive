<b>Slightly Insane Graphics</b> is an [[Communist|evil]] Proboards forum that is composed retardation and fail. The forum is run by the admin, [[Faggot|Smangii]], and couple of other [[Retards|people]]. All of the members on the forum believe that they are artists in some odd way and [[Unwarrented self-importance|should be treated with respect]]. The "[[Crap|art]]" that they make is horrible in every way possible.

One of the [[Retarded|coolest]] parts of SI is the coding boards. Apparently, people that post codes on the website think that they can copyright syntactical Javascript code (which takes no skill at all [[amirite]]?). These codes will only work with [[Proboards|Proshit]] forums. They are mostly used for the "[[Fail|wow]] factor" of the forums that they are applied to. Most of the codes perform the same shitty tasks as other ones do that were posted on the forum.

After a while, Smangii and a couple of other admins found that people were not posting enough. In order to get people back on their forum and posting like crazy, they added a marketplace (aka crackhouse) board to reward stupid people for posts. The more posts, the more [[Fail|fake money]] people could have to change their name's color, style, and all the other worthless shit you could do to to [[HTML]] text. Soon enough, people started whoring themselves out like Russian [[Whores|hookers]] to get the [[Fail|fake money]], and kissing the admins' ass in order to become mods to boards (which would never happen).

All of the wise people left the forum when they still could or got banned for just talking back to the admins. Now the forum is under a totalitarian leadership where if you even say one thing against the forum, [[Shit nobody cares about|the admins will ban or delete your account off of the forum]] (like anyone would care).

==Chat Boards==
The chat boards are full of drama. Whether if it is someone bitching about life or just wants to talk about a stupid topic, they always deserve a [[Troll|beating]]. The lack of trolls in these boards has lead to an influx of drama therefore making the faggotry of the whole forum skyrocket. Many trolls have tried to make the boards more [[Fucktarded|interesting]], but have [[Banhammer|failed]].

Recently, veterans of the forum have tried turning the sub-boards into [[B|/b/]], but have [[fail|failed]].

==Some of the Many Ways to Troll==
[[Image:Fuckerpunch.jpg|thumb|[[Typical]] [[Faggot|user]].]]
*Spam [[Gay]] porn throughout the whole forum. This will work only if one uses different IPs and usernames. Otherwise, they can just delete all of the posts that were posted by that one user. [[Last Thursday|One time]], the forum was actually shutdown for a day because of this. According to the note that was posted when Slightly Insane was down, the admins had to do some "clean-up" work on the forum.
*Target an admin on the forum and pick on them for a while.
*Gain [[Faggot|Smangii's]] trust and try to become an admin. Then [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|delete everything]] on that board or section.

There are many other ways to troll, but need experimenting first.

==Butthurt==
After many attacks on SI through the shoutbox and chatroom feature, the admins decided to take away those features. Many of the users were [[butthurt]] when they noticed that the chatroom and shoutbox were gone. They started bitching. The admin stepped in right away shut the users up as usual instead of listening to them.

{{quote|If you want to instant chat, go on MSN or AIM. This is a forum, where we "chat" in threads. There's no limit as to what can be said in a thread and what can't :P There was a Live Chat enabled once, but it was [[Rape|abused]]... so I disabled it.|Smangii - Admin of SIGFX}}

{{quote|Then here's a simple solution; Get a chatbox/shoutbox that requires you to register, so no [[Trolls|guests]] can "[[Own|shout]]". This way it should also [[Seven Proxies|log the IP's]].|[[Typical]] Idiotic User}}
