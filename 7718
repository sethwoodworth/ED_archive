Sparkling Wiggles
[[Image:Sparklingwigglestruman.jpg|thumb|right| A proud moment in our nation's history.]]'''Sparkling Wiggles''' is made of insta-[[drama]], extreme [[lulz]] and [[win|EPIC WIN!!!]]. 

This is the story of a white, [[loli|four-year-old girl]] with a [[retard|speech impediment]] being [[troll]]ed by her own parents who [[ruin|badger]] her relentlessly into saying "sparkling wiggles" over and over again whilst recording it on video.

However, because of her impediment, whenever she tries to say "'''sparkling wiggles'''" it comes out as "'''fucking [[niggers]]'''". From the mouth of babes comes the [[fact|truth]]; and from the truth comes lively [[flame war|debate]] over (perceived) racism when said video is posted on [[YouTube]].

==How Sparkling Wiggles Conquered [[YouTube]]==

[[Image:Wiggles.jpg|thumb|right|She said "sparkling wiggles" not [[gay|flaming wiggles]], dammit!]]

Long, long ago, a man known only as [[weev]] found a video on glumbert.com. After watching it, he decided it was made of win and awesome. [[weev]] then went into [[ED]] [[irc]] and posted a notice, "All graphic designers, see weev". [[user:Sokevinsays|A_RAPE_SPIDER]] was there at the time and decided to check out what was going on. [[weev]] asked [[A_RAPE_SPIDER]] to make an image, the final result was the original sparkling wiggles image.

Later that night, [[A_RAPE_SPIDER]] decided that sparkling wiggles needed its own article on [[ED]], but to make the article lulzy he would need to embed the video on the page, something glumbert.com did not allow. [[Dynamic Entry|Enter]] [[User:Janus zeal|janus zeal]]. Together A_RAPE_SPIDER and janus plotted to steal the lulz and host them on [[YouTube]]. This worked for a few days until the movie was deleted for violations. However, some one else had also hosted the video, and as of March 05, the video has 565,015 Views, 1,565 Comments, and has been favorited 2,211 times. It also has the following honors:

More proof that if its popular, [[YouTube]] wont do anything about it, even if they deleted the exact same video in the past.<br/>
Sometime while [[ED]] was [[pool's closed|closed]] due to [[aids]], Sparkling Wiggles was deleted from [[YouTube]]. Too little, too late.

==University of Michigan Pwn'd==
In 2007, the all pasty-white co-ed Winter Broomball team of the University of Michigan called itself "The Sparkling Wiggles". Perhaps this was meant to be an extreme form of irony, as if these crackers were any whiter, they'd be see-thru clear.
