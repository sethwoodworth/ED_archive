What happens when you get one unemployed, self righteous, unfunny, manic depressive fucktard, who is given internet access to a world of other unemployed, self righteous, unfunny, manic depressive fucktards, and continually heap on undeserved praise for championing a [[liberal|political movement]] based solely around mocking religious zealots (as long as they're not Muslims, Because that would be racist) on YouTube? 

'''Coughlan666''' happens. From his humble beginnings shouting obscenities at [[Christian|theist]] [[Islam|scum]] over the internet, [[Foo Fighters|Dave Grohl]] ([[drugs|on meth]]) look alike Richard [[Cock|"The Dick"]] Coughlan stumbled onto internet stardom after instigating various civil wars within his beloved YouTube Atheist community and, despite [[USI|priding]] himself as an expert in the ways of [[Leet|pwnage]], more often than not [[Raid Backfire|ends up publicly humiliated by the very people]] he intended to mock. The resulting [[emo|hysteria]] and [[Jews Did WTC|conspiracy theories]] he subsequently spouts are the stuff of legends.

==Humble Beginnings==
[[File:SelectiveOutrage.png|thumb|right|Coughlan666 recoils in horror at the thought of creationism in schools but his beloved Islam can do no wrong]]
Like many who lack the required insight and charm to make their opinions worth anything to anyone else, Richard Coughlan sat at his computer and watched a handful of videos by [[TheAmazingAtheist]]. Enamored at how such a slovenly, disheveled creature was somehow commanding a [[hugbox|fanbase]], Coughlan decided that if he [[Windows Movie Maker|spice up]] his vlogs and added fast paced music with a [[Fuckton|plethora]] of curse words thrown in for good measure, [[Unrealistic expectations|he too could appear]] to be a well educated, articulate individual. And as well educated, articulate individuals tend to do, he set off to YouTube to antagonize softball targets such as [[Creationists]] and [[Pedo|children]], with  hopes he himself could one day champion the [[Faggot|Intelligent Atheist]] way.

<center><youtube>CVjKTuPQ62k</youtube></center>

And so it was that Richard joined the hordes of webcam warriors to crusade for the [[Douchebag|rational and intelligent]] Atheist agenda by finding retards on the internet and swearing at them in 10 minute intervals. In time, Coughlan himself had establish a [[Chris chan|true and loyal fanbase]] that followed his every word with bated breath. And it was so as Coughlan soldiered on, displaying his Atheist intelligence on such commentating superweights as [[VenomFangX]] and [[ChristianU2ber]].

==Instigating The YouTube Atheist Civil War of 2010==
[[File:RichardRetort.png|thumb|right|[[Fag|The wise and insightful]] Coughlan politely discussing a difference of opinion in that classic Atheist way.]]
During [[Shit nobody cares about|the 2010 United Kingdom general election]], it had come to Coughlans attention that fellow Atheist Superstar [[Patcondell|Pat Condell]] had urged his fellow Atheists to vote for the [[Conservative|right wing]] United Kingdom Independence Party, who shared Condells staunch anti-Islam opinions. Coughlan, an admitted "[[liberal|left wing]], black person loving, [[basement dweller|pale skinned]], [[Pro-Ana|anorexic]], [[Mexican|bean eating]], fucking [[What|trout]]", took great offense to someone who prided themselves on living a rational, Godless life having a differing opinion on him in regards to politics, and proceeded to handle the matter like intelligent and rational Atheists do; he got on his webcam and cursed at Condell for [[TL;DW|17 fucking minutes]] while insisting that [[Fact|Atheism has been around for 5 years]] and that he'll end up a martyr for the struggle.

}}
</center>



As it tends to do, Coughlans righteous indignation lighted a passionate fury amongst his community. Denouncing Condell as a [[furry|wolf in sheeps clothing]] impostor, Coughlan encouraged his viewers that they too should show their educated dissent and also scream obscenities at Condell for not being in line with the good and proper Atheist way. Condell responded in typical [[Nazi|fascist]] manner, by [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LTKzg1K7Es calmly explaining his decision]. Coughlan, taking this new video as a personal challenge, responded with yet another video, claiming he had now [[Internet celebrity|been made]] amongst the thousands clogging the tubes with their inane bullshit and that now the gloves were off. Coughlan was on the attack, chastising Condells nigger hating propaganda.

<center><youtube>kXTcAPJJI24</youtube></center>

To the Atheists, the rift was the opening shot of something inconceivably terrible, a unified, intelligent community was splintering. In reality, two faggots were fighting over faggot shit that nobody but faggots cared about. 

But then boys and girls, something [[Epic Win|amazing]] happened.

==The Dick Gets Offended==
[[File:CoughlansCondellFixation.png|thumb|right|Well it took months, but it's finished! [[Irony|WHO'S THE CRAZY OBSESSED HATER NOW PAT LOLOLOLOLOL]]]]
The heated drama between Condell and Coughlan garnered much attention from Atheists on Youtube, but as the conflict dragged on, the notorious "Dick" Coughlans facade began to break down. [[Rage|Rabid]] Pat Condell fans began to flock on Coughlans channel, plastering his comment box with [[flame|hateful comments]] and, to top it off, a [[DMCA]]! The turn of events shocked and confused Coughlan, as he could for the life of him understand why the [[Idiot|logical and intelligent]] YouTube Atheists, who had made stars of him and others who made a point of trolling and swearing at retards, would now be trolling and swearing at him.

<center><youtube>RJUu9OpXVik</youtube></center>

Despite being a total badass, free-thinking rebel who opposed convention, Richard "[[Asshole|The Dick]]" Coughlan began pleading for his beloved Atheist community to stop being so mean to him, [[Irony|calling them out for their hypocrisy]]. The overwhelming paradox of the situation didn't halt the onslaught, and Coughlan was berated by his once loyal fanbase.

===The Dick Gets Dox'd===
[[File:Condell.jpg|thumb|right|Clearly worse than [[Hitler]].]]
[[File:Cry_Coughlan.jpg|thumb|right|Clearly the reason why he's called THE DICK!.]]

After crying in the previous video, Coughlan was trolled even harder, however he had now revealed that the stakes have been raised. He announced that he had gotten a death threat with his dox attached, claiming that he had no choice but to hand over the information to counter the barrage of DMCA'd videos. He concluded the video with his trademark well elaborated, highly convincing Atheist reasoning; screaming [[Rage|FUCK YOU!]] at his webcam.

<center><youtube>amtIhT2MRmE</youtube></center>

===The Condell Conspiracies===
[[File:CondellMahBoi.jpg|thumb|right|Pictured: [[Obsession|Every single Coughlan video after said drama]]]].
Coughlan, along with his cadre of faggots, immediately declared that Pat Condell was personally behind the dox drop and subsequent threats, with the working theory being that Condell, a [[Dumbass|very influential figurehead]] of the budding Atheist movement, couldn't be publically humiliated like he had been when The Dick called him out on his Atheist betraying right wing political leanings, and so Condell had personally sent his legion to DMCA Coughlan, obtain his information, and taunt him with the details before inevitably murdering him, thus ensuring the continuation of the British Right wings hijacking of the highly coveted Atheist community of YouTube vloggers. 

Supporters uploaded videos in droves, pledging unwavering support for Coughlan in his time of crisis and promising swift, brutal [[Rape|retaliation]] for Condell and his gaggle of internet terrorists for their gurus pain; that Coughlan may have [[Asking for it|made himself the target]] of people without any actual affiliation with Pat Condell at all and that maybe his previous time on YouTube alternating between antagonizing batshit Christians and publicly [[BAWWWW|crying like a fucking loon]] over trivial shit had attracted a horde of trolls who have no motive other than [[IDIFTL|fun]] has yet to be acknowledged.


==The Amazing Atheist and Fakesagan Push Richard To The Brink==

But the Pat Condell incident was not Coughlans first experience with antagonizing people more popular than him and then immediately regretting it. In another notable [[flame war|spat]] with fellow YouTube nerds, in the Spring of 2009 Coughlan found himself embroiled in a dick measuring contest with Atheist Superstars and gay lovers [[Fakesagan]] and [[TAA|The Amazing Atheist]]. The back and forth went on with the usual Amazaing Atheist super [[lame|hilarious]] [[Dane Cook|fast paced,]] [[Carlos Mencia|hyper spliced]] insults while Coughlan retorted with his trademark [[Faggotry|British wit]]; YouTube atheists far and wide either took sides in the epic conflict or begged for an immediate end to war as nerd battled nerd over the hearts and minds of armchair theologists and [[High school|dropout]] philosophers the world over.

The war ended suddenly and [[Epic win|hilariously]] [[HAHAHA OH WOW|4 days later]] when The Dick, famous for his bone dry wit and vicious [[pwn|pwnage]], came to the conclusion that he couldn't handle the merciless onslaught of unflattering vlogs directed at him and handled the situation in the most appropriate and dignified way he knew how; cutting a 10 minute [[Wrestling|Mick Foley promo]] and warning Atheist and Fakesagan that if the [[lulz|torture]] didn't end he would be [[Joker|driven insane and not responsible for what he would do]].

<center><youtube>Eafy-2y0K7o</youtube></center>

Not long after Coughlan imploring for leniency, he ripped the video down and flagged mirrors, apparently coming to the [[Slowpoke|delayed conclusion]] that tearfully begging someone you're trying to [[buttsex|pwn]] was [[retarded|probably sending a conflicting message]]. Unfortunately for him, Fakesagan pounced on the video and mirrored it, mocking Coughlans severe emotional distress and pointing out the irony of Coughlans indignation before claiming victory.

<center><youtube>aPKOx-xWgA4</youtube></center>

<center><youtube>M7GQe2Cz4MA</youtube></center>

In response, Coughlan flagged the mirror and Fakesagans channel, resulting in it being [[b&|suspended]]. He now downplays the entire event, claiming he [[Lie|did it for the lulz]] and isn't [[Yes|actually a complete and total pussy]].

==Raped By [[Thunderf00t]]==
[[File:CoughlanThunder2.png|thumb|right|[[Lie|"I had evidence and then it went vanished before anyone but me could see it..."]]]]

In one of the more [[boring|cohesive, elaborate]] videos about The Dick, Thunderf00t made a [[tl;dr|drawn out]] video which followed Coughlans longstanding history of batshit theatrics during his stay on YouTube, exposing not only Coughlans hypocritical [[BAWWW|whining]] but his faggot followers as well. It should be mentioned that a number of troll accounts have been made to spread the Hystronic Personality Disorder theory. This blatant act of faggotry must be seen in the proper light. In other words, keep calm and carry on.

Despite fancying himself as an anti-Christian troll, Coughlan666 has shown that he is perfectly capable of being induced to tears by a supposed Christian troll (or anything) over nothing more than his videos being temporarily taken down because of a [[DMCA]] notice. Of course anyone that has a Youtube channel that hosts music would easily tell you that getting a DMCA notice isn't the end of the world, don't tell that to Coughlan666; who immediately proceeded to counter the DMCA notice with [[docs|his actual contact information]] before wondering how and why he was being prank called. Regardless, Coughlan took the easy-mode trolling technique and declared that he was the [[Victim|victim]] of Honest-to-God [[censorship]], and theorized that the best way to counter someone who was clearly only interested in provoking a reaction from him was to announce in no uncertain terms that he was incredibly upset about these developments and making veiled threats of violence while holding back tears before '''literally''' begging his viewers to mirror the video while explaining that because of his [[Wishful thinking|fame]] he was in a precarious position to being silenced by the cruel and ruthless trolls.

==Coughlan the Comedian==
[[File:LordofFilthCoughlan.png|thumb|right|Coughlan crowns himself "Lord of Filth"; isn't [[Homeless|entirely inaccurate]].]]
[[File:CoughlanReviews.jpg|thumb|right]]
Many [[Retards|staunch Coughlan supporters]] counter those that mock and attack [[old meme|The Dick]] by explaining his critics are simply missing the entire point of his schtick; Richard Coughlan is a [[Failure|''comedian'']], [[Some argue|they insist]]. [[Nerd rage|Wildly irrational and highly disproportionate]] response to an otherwise well articulated point from a rival? "[[Bullshit|Deliberate]] satire of course!" Uncalled for, bottom of the barrel vulgarity? "Why, Coughlan is using this shocking language to educate!". Indeed, like [[2 gryphon|many before him]], Richard Coughlan confused biting social commentary via comedy with sprinkling half assed political opinions about whatever flavor of the now topic was circulating the tubes before continuing to scream and flail about like a chimp with downs.

Just like [[George Carlin]]!.

Unfortunately for The Dick, his patented brand of sandwiching "[[Trying too hard|offensive]]" opinions of the social zeitgeist in between poorly thought out comedy bits about soft ball targets was more in line with the [[Carlos Mencia]] approach to comedy. Between both his relatively minor success in regards to his [[internet famous|notoriety]] amongst his internet atheist colleagues and stylistic choice of his videos, Coughlans profound incompetence at anything other than provoking butthurt amongst other would-be YouTube savants has instead given him all the credibility of an emaciated, rat faced [[Dane Cook]] of the Atheist vloggers. 

It's [[Common knowledge|hypothesized]] that his general all around failure at producing anything entertaining deliberately and desire to siphon e-cred from others has fed his insatiable need to pick fights with otherwise like-minded individuals, yet because he understands just [[Nothing|just ''barely'']] enough about the internet to realize he'd be raped beyond recognition if he were to reveal his unstable whaling were sincere, believes if he retorts with "[[I did it for the lulz]]" ages after the fact that it will magically wash away the stench of ridicule, years of historical evidence to the contrary be damned.

==Relationship and Downfall==
[[File:CoughlansTwitterBAAAW.png|thumb|right|'King Pwn' handling private matters like [[Perez Hilton|a true logical, intelligent]] person would.]]
The Dick was finally laid to rest ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl3pjJ-9kXQ nvm bbl])  today on November 5th 2010, having died of a [[Emo|broken heart]]. After spending over a year [[Online relationship|dating]] another youtuber living in America calling herself [[Attention Whore|xxxThePeachxxx]] (which began when Coughlan666 posted a [[Creepy|public video]] talking about [[Internet stalker|how wonderful she is]]). 

<center><youtube>yls3AUiPgT4</youtube></center>

He was dumped last week in favour of a [[Fag|bisexual]] man [[IRL]] calling himself Devchelle2. The Dick's natural response was to demonstrate his [[dubious disclaimer|desire not to punish]] xxxThePeachxxx by posting a video and turning [[Shit nobody cares about|the event]] into a spectacle on the [[Internets]]:

<center><youtube>L5TGgYcikVw</youtube></center>

Since the video was posted, xxxThePeachxxx was flooded with [[trolls]] calling her a [[Truth|cheating whore]]. This inspired her to make a BlogTV statement that Devchelle2 offered her a place to stay [[Bullshit|out of the kindness of his heart]] after her father kicked her out and [[Pwnd|disowned]] her for dating Coughlan666 in the first place, and things just [[Sex|got complicated]] when xxxThePeachxxx [[Desperate|ran to Devchelle2 for comfort]] and fell in [[love]] after [[slut|barely a month]] of living with him. This all took place after xxxThePeachxxx in a [[retard|fit of temporary insanity]], decided to [[marry]] Coughlan666 and move to [[England]] to be with him before it [[Obvious|dawned on her]] how [[lol wut|ridiculous]] that plan was. Sounds implausible? Let the [[insane|crazy bitch]] speak for herself:

<center><youtube>k4chbe0XwkI</youtube></center>
<center><youtube>mJT88EbGIOk</youtube></center>


<center>And her boytoy, [[white knight|defending]] the woman he barely knows but is [[gullible|SO in love with:]]</center>

<center><youtube>2cgs82etM00</youtube></center>
<center>TL;DW- NU UH!</CENTER>


[[Sarcasm|Clearly]], The Dick [[idiot|knows how to pick 'em]].

xxxThePeachxxx vowed on BlogTV that it would take [[Internet tough guy|more to scare her off the internets]] than the all the abuse she was [[In the ass|receiving]] on her youtube page. Less than 24 hours later, xxxThePeachxxx demonstrated her resolve against the wave of [[Truth|mean comments]] by [[Fail|closing her account]]. A few hours later, <strike>Coughlan666 did the world the same favour and [[An Hero|removed himself]] from youtube out of [[Troll's remorse|guilt]]</strike> said he was taking a little break and would come right back to continue the same [[faggotry]] he is [[internet celebrity|well known for]].


===The Dick Takes Responsibility. Kind Of.===
Clarifying his previous internet-suicide note, Coughlan666 claimed he [[Lie|was just feeling so very guilty]] by [[Bullshit|"unintentionally"]] sending his rabid fanbase to swarm Peach and then proceeding to give vivid details of her [[White trash| her Daddy issues and private life]]. Richard then decided to detail his personal life over the internet by saying his viewers are wrong by taking such a vested interest in his personal life and how terrible the entire situation is because of his sabbatical, insisting there was nobody else [[Rimjob|'doing this better than me!']] before blasting his fantards for doing exactly what they did in the past and what he knew they were going to do again.

<center><youtube>XwCzaGlVsko</youtube></center>

{{Q|Peach is the opposite of me, she has some dignity.|Coughlan before remedying the situation and blabbering about Peach's quite undignified personal life }}

===The Dick Abuses All His Supporters===
[[File:CoughlanTheDick.jpg|thumb|right|Crying over Amazing Atheist is one thing. But [[Deleting Your YouTube Videos|closing your channel]]? Have some fucking dignity...]]
Continuing his [[you bawww, you lose|inability]] to understand he is [[drama queen|causing all his own problems]], Coughlan666 posted a video the very next day, quite clearly [[meth|methed]] off his ass, [[fucktard|pissing on all the people]] who offered positive comments in support of him:

<center><youtube>VP2stA8dtTw</youtube></center>

Apparently, The Dick is [[attention whore|incapable]] of restraining himself from [[unwarranted self-importance|announcing]] to the [[internets]] that his [[shit nobody cares about|personal issues]] are [[serious business|serious fucking business]].

{{Q|It's been 9 days of Hell & I still don't understand what the fuck is going on? I hope it all makes sense or I'm stuck with this feeling :(|Coughlan on his [http://twitter.com/coughlan616 twitter page] summing up his default mental state when uploading videos. }}


===xxxThePeachxxx Shits All Over the [[Losers|Free-Thinking, Rational Atheist Community]]===
[[File:CoughlanFans.png|thumb|right|"But but if you think about it, I'm [[moar|MORE]] of a rebel for white knighting for Coughlan! WHORE!]]
A week or so after the initial dramabomb, xxxThePeachxxx decided to pull a very Coughlan-like move and undelete her YouTube. The unexpected twist however is that she took the oppurtunity not to reward her well wishers with [[fellatio|praise and thanks]] for a show of support during her rough patch but instead [[Win|called out the USI havin', herp derpin' clusterfuck that was the YouTube Atheist Alliance]].

<center><youtube>S_wMykaLo2M</youtube></center>

{{Q|I got to see what this farce of a "rational free-thinkers" club was really made of.|ThePeach, [[shocked and appalled|quite surprised]] by YouTube's lack of class.}}

Peach, much like Coughlan himself, seemed '''completely''' caught off guard that a horde of cunts who make a point of swarming those who hold a different opinion than them would suddenly turn so venomous so quickly once she did something [[For great justice|they didn't like]].

===Peach and The Dick Today===

Since the fiasco, both parties moved on from the nastiness and continued their lives peacefully. [[No|Or did they]]? A quick check of boths Twitter will show that, while Peach has made no subsequent reference of The Dick post-break up, Coughlan has sent frequent tweets her way on an almost daily basis, clearly ready to add [[Internet stalking|stalking]] to his long and impressive resume.

==Coughlan the [[Capitalist|Brand]]==
[[File:CoughlanQuits.png|thumb|right|Couhjlan shows as much determination and fortitude as he ever does.]]
After his break up and subsequent <strike>exile return sabbatical glorious resurrection</strike> time out, Coughlan made yet ''another'' video detailing his [[Stupid|ingenious]] idea to keep attention on him while [[Lurking|not being on YouTube anymore]]; have ''other'' would-be Atheist stars post videos on his channel! That's right boys and girls, Richard has come up with the [[That Guy With The Glasses|original idea]] to have people even less interesting than him keep his spirit alive by posting their own [[TL;DW|engaging]] material on the Coughlan616 channel!

Or not...

Not 2 weeks later Coughlan headed the anguished cries of a thousand moaners and abandoned the project entirely, pulling all but a single submitted video and using the channel to direct people to (favorite his own) new account and videos, '''Coughlan000'''! That the world renown Dick has resorted to sockpuppet faggotry for shameless self promotion will undoubtedly go unnoticed by his placated base.

==Trolling Richard Coughlan; A [[Strategy Guide|How-To]]==
[[File:Blawwwck.png|thumb|right|How an intellectual heavyweight handles criticism.]]
If you were to take a look at the comment section of any given Coughlan video you'll see one of two types of comments: ecstatic and diehard support, or a [[4chan|failtroll]] spouting what he believes is concentrated hilariousness. A lesser seen response to a Coughlan video would be [[Verbose|articulate]], [[boring|rational]] observations of Richards faggotry, which upon first observation you probably chalked up to the [[common knowledge]] that the kind of people that comment on YouTube videos are either dickriders or retards. The hilarious truth, however, is that during his career of receiving theoretical cockrubs and kudos from the mouthbreathers that are the YouTube Atheist Alliance gained from trolling trailer trash, when confronted by someone without spare chromosomes, Coughlan is put in the precarious position of having to defend himself without falling back on such classics as "You [[Chav|shhhhhhhhhhhtyupid fawk]]". Though tempting to call out Coughlan on his douchebaggery in a blunt and speedy manner, stating the obvious gives his faggot fanbase an opportunity to spew shit like "omg so mad COUGHLAN TTYL PWN U XD". 

Any retard can (and most of them will) declare somebody pointing out what a failure they are as a victory as the opposition didn't attempt to debunk what they said said, but putting them in a position to have to justify their rambling bullshit usually results in hilarity. And because even a crackhead can comprehend that nothing good ever came from a civilized dialog, Coughlan realized the best way to handle such criticism would be to ignore it completely by removing said opposing viewpoints and blocking accounts that make them. Try it at home, kids! It's simple; sign up a sockpuppet on YouTube and try out one of our handy phrases!

* "I respectfully disagree with your political stance
* "For somebody that prides himself on picking on retarded children you sure do get offended easily."
* "A lot of your problems could have been avoided had you not reacted like a complete knob."
* "What part of advertising your personal life on the internet seemed it was a good idea?"

Unfunny, non hostile, and completely and totally reasonable retorts guaranteed to send Coughlan and company into a confused frenzy.
