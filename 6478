[[Butthurt]] over the Jewish bias of the Nobel Prize Committee, [[spider experts|atheist scientists]] began work on their own [[The Comprehensive Theory of Lulz|competing theories about the universe]].

=Poe's Law=
[[Image:poes_law.png|thumb|right|This is how [[memes]] are born [http://christianforums.com/showthread.php?p=17606580#post17606580 sauce] ]]

Modernly stated as:

Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to [[troll]] a fundamentalist in such a way that ''someone'' won't mistake for the genuine article.

Examples:

* [[Net Authority]]
* [[Spore|AntiSpore]]
* [[The Colbert Report]]
==Poe's Corollary==

There is a dual to Poe's Law called Poe's Corollary which states:

It is impossible for an act of fundamentalism to be made that ''someone'' won't mistake for a parody.

Examples:

* [[Ann Coulter]]
* [[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]
* [[Fox News]]
* [[Fred Phelps]]
* [[Jack Chick]]
* [[Intelligent Design]]

==Troll-Luser Convergence Theorem==

Poe's Law and Poe's Corollary are a special cases of what's known as the [[Troll]]-[[Luser]] Convergence Theorem. Intuitively, what this means is that [[successful troll|sophisticated trolls]] are indistinguishable. This is the fundamental insight which guides modern theories of trollings.

This is the observation that [[EPoints|fuels the economies]] of the [[basement dwellers|modern troll industry]].

=[[Piss|Epistimology]] of lulz=
Modern [[lulzkilling]] scientists and philosophers are searching for [[Objectivism|objective]] ways of distinguishing between [[Common Sense|parodies of retards]] and [[Why do you hate America?|actual retards]].

==[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test Turing test]==
After [[r9k|many failed attempts]] at eliminating [[copypasta]] and [[cancer]], [[Alan Turing]] devised a challenge in order to raise the bar of automated [[spam]], [[crapfloods]], and [[trolling]]. The goal of this challenge is to randomly select between a human troll and a software troll and see if the software troll is so good that the trollee is not able to distinguish between the two.

The major flaw in this test is that as the [[frustration]] of even the most experienced of judges builds, their ability to distinguish between obvious trolls and newfags decreases to the point where even the most [[Katy|idiotic of things]] generates a response.

==[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room Chinese room]==
Not satisfied with the Turing test, other philosophers devised a stronger version of the test called the [[Moonspeak|Chinese room]] experiment. Which doesn't make any sense because the only thing Chinese people do in [[prison|a room]] is play [[Warcraft]], [[amirite]]?
