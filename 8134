The '''[http://anti-ed-club.deviantart.com/ Anti-ED-Club]''' <strike>is</strike> ''was'' a club formed by butthurt users on [[DeviantART]] who can't get over the [[fact]] that their articles on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] are here to stay.  The club was joined by such illustrious members as [[Teruchan]], [[SapphyDracases]], [[Skuee]], and [[LittleCloud|Sephys-Little-Cloud]] within the club's 24-hour lifespan. After that point, the dA [[admin]]s decided to mercy-ban the club before the tartlets managed to dig their already unfathomably deep graves any deeper.

[[It is a mystery]] exactly who had the brilliant idea to form the club in the first place. Whoever it was, the club shifted ownership shortly before its death to none other than [[LittleCloud]], newly appointed leader of the 'peaceful support group'. He, as well as the original owner, is a [[fag]].

==The Original Journal Entry==
[[Image:AntiEDoriginaljournal.jpg]]

===Appearing on the Today Page===
[[Image:AntiED-todaypage.jpg|thumb|The club's first journal made it to DeviantART's Today Page and thus exposed the entire site to its [[faggotry]]]]
The journal quickly became one of the top journals on dA's Today Page due to the constant [[bawww|bickering]] from both sides of [[retard|retarded]] [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/5430607/527213418 arguments]. This attracted all sorts of individuals from the [[internet|tubes]] to come and [[lol]] at the expense of the tartlets still defending the club, such as [[Daveykins]], [[LittleCloud]], and [[GoddessMillenia]].
It did not take long for the [[unfunny]] dA admins to come and permaban everyone partaking in the [[lulz|lulzfest]].

== The Trap LOL ==
Also spreading awareness of the club's existence was a [[basement-dweller|conniving]] [[troll]] going by the username [http://divineangelyumiko.deviantart.com/ DivineAngelYumiko], who found the [[lulz|lulzy]] club and decided to note every one of DA's biggest [[lol-cow|lolcows]] with an invitation to join. This resulted in the joining of many of the most [[butthurt]] ED "[[rape|victims]]" to come and cry about their articles. With them being members of the club and fighting tooth and nail to defend it, much [[lulz]] were had within the [[internet|tubes]]. This event attracted fellow EDiots and spammers to the page to add to the hilarity. Below are some of the replies to the notes sent.

==The [[lame|Amazing]] debate [[skillz]] of [[LittleCloud]]==
[[Image:Anti_ED_Hate_Club.JPG|thumb|Remember, its not a hate club!]]
Not realizing the hypocrisy of creating a club to hate a site supposedly bred from hatred, Little Cloud relentlessly defended the hell out of it. It's hard to believe she refuses to accept the club [[fact|was built on hatred]], but, then again, it's [[LittleCloud|Little "I will destroy you petty humans with my fire breath" Cloud]] we're dealing with. Her [[retard]]ation and contradictions know no bounds.

==Who Started It?==
[[Some argue]] the club first was created by [http://astralstonekeeper.deviantart.com Astralstonekeeper], a butthurt [[Amuria]] fangirl and [[Gaia Online|Gaiafag]]. Others argue the account was created by [[SapphyDracases]]. Suspicion turned to [[DivineAngel]] once the club owner began to hide comments en masse and [[ALL CAPS|scream in CAPS]] in the journal.  In the end, [http://honeybee-manor.deviantart.com Honeybee-manor] [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/5312732/530138804 claimed to actually be the one who started it].

==Version 2.0: ~antiED==
[[Image:HAET_CLUB_by_Rm3k.png|thumb|Made in honor of antiED. [[InSaNe-REYNARD]] finds it funny.]]

On February 10th, 2008, a new anti-ED club was founded on dA under the name [http://antied.deviantart.com/ antiED].  [[InSaNe-REYNARD|Whoever founded said club]] is dumber than a rock because:

# First and foremost, he is against ED, and has no understanding of lulz or satire.
# He attempted to recreate a [[ban]]ninated club, and didn't listen when [[everyone]], even LittleCloud, said it was a bad idea.
# He expected both [[butthurt|the people who hate ED]] and [[trolls|the people who support ED]] to use '''"common sense,"''' have '''"manners,"''' and speak without using '''"<u>[[chikins|fowl]]</u> words."'''
# Most importantly, he chose the most inopportune day to create said club: every [[anon]], [[furry]], and [[your mom|general user of the internet]] was so involved in [[Project Chanology]] on February 10th that [[Noone]] noticed the creation of the club, and therefore it [[fail]]ed by default, falling into the category of [[shit nobody cares about]].
