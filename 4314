Jew Gold
<i>See main article at: [[money|teeth]].</i>

'''Jew Gold''' is the bag of gold that all [[Jews]] carry around their necks at all times.  It acts as a constant reminder to be a [[redundant|cheap, greedy Jew]], and has apparently worked like a charm for their people for [[over 9000|thousands]] of years.

[[PROTIP]]: all Jews carry [[fake]] Jew gold around their necks to protect their real Jew gold from getting stolen.  [[You]] can help by stealing ''both''.

==Cornering the Jew Gold Market==

Jews will buy your Gold and convert it to Jew Gold in the hopes of cornering the Jew Gold market. This is due to the well known fact that all paper currencies are eventually used as toilet paper.
