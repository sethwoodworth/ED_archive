@tayfife how much canadian cube promotig can u really do from LA? who verified these contestants anywayz? #thehypercube|@Nauseam, June 25 via Twitter|
@tayfife Its an insult to my creative friends in contest who worked hard, then have some guy sitting back in US b given a cube @thehypercube|@Nauseam, June 25 via Twitter|
@tayfife hows that even close to bein fair? peeps just want a fair contest. feel sorry for non-winners who shoulda won @thehypercube|@Nauseam, June 25 via Twitter|
@SunnyCrittenden read ur article. contest friend tells me u forgot 2 mention when french judge made stmt after they >> @thehypercube|@Nauseam, June 26 via Twitter|
@SunnyCrittenden >> picked QC winners b4 they went to TO to pick remaining winners, he said 1/4 million$ going to QC ppl @thehypercube|@Nauseam, June 26 via Twitter|
@SunnyCrittenden sounds like they predetermined number of cubes 4 their target markets. its all marketing in the end @thehypercube|@Nauseam, June 26 via Twitter|
@thehypercube if your gonna quote contest rulz at losers 4 reasons why they lost, lets quote some other rulz too…|@Nauseam, June 27 via Twitter|
@thehypercube rulz state that contestants must be permanent resident of canada. i hear @tayfife lives in the US. not fair to cdns.|@Nauseam, June 27 via Twitter|
@thehypercube rulz state “competition is subject to all applicable federal, provincial and municipal laws”|@Nauseam, June 27 via Twitter|
@thehypercube this includz copyright laws does it not? why did some winner’s contest material have stuff that violated copyright?|@Nauseam, June 27 via Twitter|
@thehypercube some winners had muzak that wuznt there’s & violates copyrights, like @Cube_man vids.|@Nauseam, June 27 via Twitter|
@thehypercube some winners made stuff outta trademarked material that ain’t there’s & violates copyright, like @BeCircle with drupal logo|@Nauseam, June 27 via Twitter|
@thehypercube so how can u say the contest is all fair & legal? lotsa ppl upset cuz of unfairness not cuz they lost.|@Nauseam, June 27 via Twitter|@BeCircle dries buytaert license is by-nc-sa. i didn’t see any attribution or license stmt in your work. #thehypercube|@Nauseam, June 27 via Twitter|
@BeCircle cuz you won something with money value it is now commercial purpose which violates by-nc-sa license. #thehypercube|@Nauseam, June 27 via Twitter|
Call your #thehypercube “my four-wheeled chamber of forgotten dignity”. @photojunkie. alternatively, “the idiot box” is an ol’ classic.|@petermansbridg, July 8 via Twitter|
@photojunkie You two should play bumper-cubes. Try it at high speeds for maximum enjoyment.|@petermansbridg, July 8 via Twitter|

ya, now I’m getting to the point in the comments where everything is getting…awkward…and tense…not so happy anymore…:(|@PhilKnudson, June 27 via Twitter|
