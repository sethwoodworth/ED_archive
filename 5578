MyWeb
[[Image:Mywebscreencap.JPG|thumb|How MyWeb works.]] 

[[MyWeb]] is a service provided by [[Yahoo]].  It allows you to save any webpage you see for future archiving. Currently in a beta phase that's lasted for at least two and a half years, it can save screencaps of constantly-changing pages, or, perhaps, [[friends]]locked [[LJ]] entries. Unfortunately, it does not strip out identifying information. When a post is archived and published using MyWeb, it will clearly identify the user who did the archiving, thus allowing for quick [[defriend]]ing and only minimal [[lulz]].

[[Frienditto|Sound familiar]]?
