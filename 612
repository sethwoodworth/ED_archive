Arkalochori
'''Arkalochori''' is the [[Wikipedia]] alias of the ED editor [[User:Lateral|Lateral]]. [[Some argue]] that he is the filthiest of the dirty [[The Wikipedia Jews]], and an [[allegedly|alleged]] sock puppet of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:List_of_banned_users&diff=prev&oldid=153876237 Blu Aardvark] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Miltopia&diff=126772299&oldid=126279161 Miltopia]. On [[ED]], he is the only [[EDiot]] who lives in Oregon besides [[Blu Aardvark]], so he constantly tags around Blu Aardvark, imitating him and trying to impress him. But on [[Wikipedia]], he goes and does the same exact thing to the Wikipedia Jews [[SlimVirgin]] and [[Jayjg]], who Blu Aardvark hates!

==Sockpuppets Galore==

He was also too cheap to help out Blu Aardvark, who couldn't afford to come to [[Lulzcon]] 2007.  Nobody else on ED was in Oregon, except for [[User:Lateral|Lateral]] who is obsessed with [[TOW]], just like him, where he went by fake name [[MichaelLinnear]] before switching to Arkalochori. Lateral was first like "Sure, I'll give him a ride" then Aardvark said, "Does your trunk have room for my [[fursuit]]?" Long story short, Lateral withdrew his offer to give him a ride. [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALateral&diff=1997220858&oldid=1997203429] To save face, Blu Aardvark claims Lateral [[Lie|is just his sock]]. Of course as to why a sockpuppet would have a car, and not the puppet master no one knows.

In playing a double agent, Lateral fails at both ED and [[Wikipedia]]. First, being a Jew he doesn't believe in God, Jesus, or [[Raptor Jesus|The Holy Spirit]], or planet [[Kolob]], so Blu Aardvark is always having to revert him when Lateral crosses the line of morals and puts up a Wikipedian's real name. Second, Blu Aardvark makes good usernames.  He makes cool usernames that sound tough.  They're like military plans of attack, because they always have an animal in them and that means they're tough. You just can't go wrong with an animal in your username. Whereas Lateral picks random words out of a dictionary, many of which are unspellable. Lateral's shitty style of names is something The Wikipedia Jews do like [[Isarig]].

Lateral also failed at being a double-agent on Wikipedia because once Jayjg went on wikibreak for half of 2007, Lateral continued pissing everyone off.  With no Jayjg to protect him, Morven went and banned him and his [[sock puppet]]s. But unlike when it happened to Isarig, once Jayjg returned, Lateral did not get unbanned.

No need to fear, for Lateral has a secret weapon against Checkusers. He can thwart all checkuser [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/75.175.2.118 through the power dialing long distance] (Geotargets far away from Oregon).

==Owning Gary Weiss==
On a positive note, he does something right:

[[Gary Weiss]] sock 1: Hey you know [[WordBomb]] really sucks.<br/>
Gary Weiss sock 2: Oh yeah WordBomb sucks.<br/>
Gary Weiss sock 3: Yeah WordBomb sucks.
