'''History of [[religion]]'''

== Ancient religions ==

Firstly, some old stupid men that were no longer capable of <s>having [[sex]]</s> work (and also not so old men who just [[DO_NOT_WANT|DID NOT WANT]] to work but considered themselves [[perfect]]) posed the following question to themselves: How to get <s>money</s> food and do nothing useful? They came to the following answer. They would threaten [[everyone]] that either everyone would give them [[profit]], or otherwise [[God|The Gods]] would begome angry, they would come and [[fuck_you|punnish everyone]]. They also invented [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|nature phenomena explaination]] that agreed with the existane of gods so that [[everyone]] believed that gods exist. So they ceased to be old stupid men. They became shamans, priests etc.

Thus the aim of the first religions was to make people afraid of fierce and curel gods. By the way, they "explained" how the world was created.

== Two thousand years ago ==

After a while, the Earth population increased. The shamans realized that they are expecting a great trouble. If the population increased more, shamans would [[fail|no longer have influence]] since people would simply want to eat <s>someone who does not really work</s>. So the following two main ideas were introduced in the religions:

* Control over reproduction. Since long time ago there were no contraception means, the only way to avoid reproduction was NOT TO HAVE SEX. So <s>anal</s> sex was strongly restricted, rules like "choose one woman, call her your wife and fuck her and nobody other <s>and that will soon become borring for you</s>" were introduced. It was declared unpleasant to speak of sex and even think of sex. Accroding to the new religion dogmas, the god appeared due to cancelation of real sex.

* Charity. That was an idea against killing [[you]] despite you were fucking shit. In fact, religion authorities aimed to prevent murder of themselves. And they were not killed during [[9000|1500]] years. Also, men had had bloody battles to find out who is the best. After that battles the winner could take a woman and make her his private property. So the evolution went. And religion restricted that process. That would intercept the evolution and as the result, also decrease the population.

Antique gods had no charity and could kill thousands of humans. There were no restrictions of sex and gods had a lot of sex between themselves. All these restrictions were introduced only with [[christian]] religion and [[islam]].

Thus the aim of two-thousand-years-old relogions was to decrease the population of the Earth. And there were unsexy notions of "morality" and "ethic", and the religions asserted them "god-originated".

== Nowadays and a bit earlier ==

But people wanted to have sex very much. They were very lack of sex. They had sex according to religion rules, but population grew. And then, during the reinissance, the influence of the religion decreased. [[Scientist|Scientists]] invented contraception and [[everyone]] could have sex and have no children. And so religion faced the following choise:

* To accept and support contraception and thus achieve its hidden goal, i. e. to decrease the population of the Earth. But that would mean that all the <s>explanaitions</s> dogmas are wrong. So the faith would no longer have influence. 

* To reject contraception. (And this choice was made.) So the religion nowadays makes the population increase and, for example, in [[Africa]] children have nothing to eat and die. Non-religious activists say: introduce more [[contraception]] in Africa. Religious activists say: Contraception is Satan's invention. Just do not have sex. But the latter is unreal so law defenders say to the faith: [[Fuck you]]!

== In future ==

It is wery likely that religion will die <s>hard</s> soon. If one wants to do nothing and get [[PROFIT]], he seizes authority and uses army. If one wants to know how the world was created, he studies science. There is contraception and [[abortion]] to decrease the Earth population.
