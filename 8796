[[Vietnam]] is a swampy commie land known for beating the [[USA|U.S.]] at war, located in South-East [[Asia]]. Their government today is basically a classic [[Communist]] state. So, like [[Jews]], they control everything from what you say to their country's media.

After the [[Vietnam War]], many [[gook]]s (the nickname for the Vietnamese people given by the [[USA|U.S.]] soldiers; unaware that the nickname came from the Korean War) migrated to the U.S.A. with the Happy soldiers, some escaping later. The basic reason for escape Vietnam was fear of being executed by the [[Communist]]s that are about to take over, so it was out of [[Liberal]]phobia. Due to this phobia, these gooks were unaware that the [[USA]] had more [[Liberal]]s then South-East [[Asia]] and Anthony Quinn's vagina combined. But many of these [[gook]]s made it OK in U.S.A. Working in beauty salons, as [[math]] teachers, even some of the migrant's daughters can be seen getting [[fuck|bang]]ed by [[big]] [[black]] [[cocks]] on the [[internet]].

==People==

Vietnam is populated by gooks and commies. All Vietnamese people are prostitutes, and for five dollah, they will love you long time. Due to this, they are often mixed up with [[Thailand]]. The difference between the two is that everyone in Thailand is a [[trap]].

All Vietnamese people are named either Charlie or Steven Nguyen(Irrelevant to [[Tila Tequila]]) due to some king from [[At least 100 years ago]] who forced them to change their last name to Nguyen or they would be [[permabanned]] IRL .
==History==

Vietnam was once ruled by a horde of midgets. After a massive [[war]] fought between the vertically challenged ruling class and an army of [[hamster|mice]], the Vietnamese people asserted their independence from their rulers and started their own country.

Unfortunately, the Vietnamese people aren't capable of fighting people over their own height, so they were consequently ruled by [[China]], [[France]], and [[Japan]] but for some reason, they're capable of sending them back to their hug boxes.

Sometime [[last Thursday]], the [[Communist]]s took over. The [[United States]] then arrived to try and fix the problem, but [[John Kerry]] had to go and [[fuck]] it up.

==Culture and Cuisine==

Vietnam has no culture. T3h [[Karl Marx|commies]] eliminated all traces of it long ago, with the assistance of their good friend and [[Al Gore|environmental activist]] [[Pol Pot]], who was well known for his love of hiking and the outdoors.

During the aforementioned Vietnam [[police brutality|Police Action]], the entire country had its foliage [[vagina|shaved bald]] by [[Fire|Agent Orange]], a potent variant of [[Kool Aid]] developed by an elite team of [[gangsta|L.A. Crips]] under the employ of the [[army|U.S. Military]]. Thus, [[at least 100|many thousands]] of [[Mexicans|immigrants]] got the bright idea to move to [[UNITINU]] and open up soup shops marketed towards [[hipsters]] and [[Tila Tequila|other displaced azns]]. Known as Phá»Ÿ (Commonly mispronounced: rhymes with "[[Jameth]]"), this soup is made primarily by boiling such things as [[Biting Beaver|cow]]'s stomach lining and [[camel spider]] semen in a [[Florida|toilet bowl]]. [[White people|Crackers]] now regularly [[fellatio|slurp down]] the culinary equivalent of [[jenkem]] for nine bucks a bowl, while the Vietnamese go eat for a buck and a half at [[McDonald's]] and hoard all the [[Jew gold]] they extract from the dumb [[Americunts]] for a [[Chocolate Rain|rainy day]]. The citizens of [[Canadia|Soviet Canuckistan]] are known to be [[YHBT|duped]] into eating this [[crap]] also, since eating nothing but Caribou and bagged milk all day can get old real fast.

Vietnam is also another great place to hire [[13 year old boys]] to [[WoW|gold-farm]] or make free Adidas for you and your [[your mom|loved ones]]. In fact, [[Alex Wuori]] hired one recently at ten cents an hour to invent [[moar]] passwords for him. Fucking [[luser]]. Dog, Cat, and aborted human fetus are very popular cuisines in Vietnam, as well as all of Asia.

==Today==

[[Liberal]] types often mispronounce Vietnam as [[Iraq]]. This is why [[liberal]]s are borderline [[retarded]]. Thus, they often bring this up in every [[LiveJournal]] political discussion about the [[Iraq]] War.

In recent years, Vietnam has benefited from a growing and thriving economy. The main impetus behind this, is that Vietnam's economy is fueled by dongs. The Vietnam Dong currently trades at a dollar-to-dong ratio of 1:[[over 9,000]]. That's a lot of dong for your dollar. LOL dONGz
