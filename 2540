[[Image:Edsingers.jpg|thumb|right|No, I don't get this face either]]

There are a few things not everyone at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] hates. Among this list are [[fucktard|white people]], [[cat|cats]], the [[New York Yankees]], and at one time, the '''ED Singers'''. {{yt|edsingers|The ED Singers}} is a YouTube channel made up of one weeaboo pretending to be three [[weeaboo]]s dedicated to singing about [[internet famous]] lulzcows with their own ED articles. The channel was created during the [[Amuria]] drama of 2008 and was focused on [[deviantART]] users. Although this account was not affiliated with ED at start, ED cool kids discovered them and and almost instantly welcomed into the inner circle of [[lulz]]. [[everything|What could possibly go wrong?]]

[[You]] can help by harassing them to '''stop''' dropping nudes.  Seriously, enough is enough. Alternatively you can buy them trips to the tanning salon so that they can hide the big red veins in their breasts.

==History==
{{Warning|@w@}}

[[File:Ero_EDS1.jpg|thumb|EDS1, once beloved by many forum users such as [[User:ero|Ero]].]]
[[File:EDSingers_Yuri.png|thumb|And she even admired [[EDF|Coolfag x HayJulay]] fan-fiction.]]

{{squote|EDS2 sat across from me in the choir room and we would always make that @w@ Face at each other to make each other lol. And some girl thought we were doing to make fun of her and claimed that it was a "Racisss clown face"|EDS1 on [[ED IRC|#wiki]]}}

The very birth of the ED singers began with a [[jailbait]], [[user:EDS1|EDS1]], and a [[loli]], EDS2, in their high school choir. EDS2 decided to introduce [[deviantART]]s queen of all [[attention whore]]s, [[Amuria]], and her article on Encyclopedia Dramatica to EDS1, who happens to be a giant [[weeaboo]] and an [[Lurker|internet surfer]]. However, EDS1 was living under an internet rock for she had no idea of what content was within Encyclopedia Dramatica. Eventually, she has gotten hooked on ED and was so enthusiastic about it and Amuria’s article that she wanted to – that’s right, sing about it.

So EDS1 and EDS2 teamed up and created the ED Singers account on [[YouTube]] and share their videos of [[lulz]]. Unfortunately, despite all the lulz they can make with their videos, they fear to link any of their personal profiles to the account and vice versa for they have no desires to receive flames from [[butthurt]] fans. They also feared that ED users would frown upon them and their videos which lead them to state that they shared no affiliation with Encyclopedia Dramatica whatsoever.

Skip forward to [[Slowpoke|late]] [[2009]], the ED Singers had their own [[User:EDsingers|ED account]] and more videos of them singing about godawful artists. Even a new member joined them, the EDS3, who successfully won their contest. One day, EDS1 was in shock when [[Sheneequa]] sent her a message inviting her to the one and only [[ED IRC]]. It seems that someone discovered the ED Singers and mentioned it to Sheneequa via IRC. Upon receiving the exact opposite reaction of what EDS1 expected, she finally joined the [[EDF]] and IRC. However, since EDS2 was still [[Jailbait|underaged]], EDS1 forbids her to enter IRC, even though she ''was'' the one who introduced her to ED in the first place, as well as having her ignore the fact that a large percentage of ED Fans are underage. EDS3 is also an IRC frequenter, but joins under the name "Vee".

==Videos==

[[Image:EDSingers_TackyAnimationsComments.png|thumb|Even on YouTube, the ED Singers still manage to steal [[dongs|hearts]] from many.]]
The ED Singers songs are obviously comparable to those of [[Weird Al Yankovic]]. Both are [[Troll|parodies]] and are written in a mocking matter. But what draws the line between them is that the ED Singers songs are actually [[funny]] and full of [[h8]], which makes a significant difference. Also, all of the images of the videos are drawn in [[MS Paint]] because EDS1 believes that they have broken enough copyright rules already.

{{squote|Our videos COMPLETELY break every single community guideline rule im sure|EDS1}}

The relationship between the ED Singers and YouTube is also rather ambiguous. Their songs appear to be a blatant attack in YouTube standards and can be taken down as a violation. Interestingly enough, they were never suspended even though the ED Singers, themselves, believe that their videos break the community guideline. YouTube also offered to have a partnership with them and place ads within their videos. YouTube is literally [[Pwn|owned]] by [[Google]], the very site that hates ED and has permbanned it from GoogleAds. However, after two weeks of their proposal, they have received no response. Surprisingly, this article will show up as the first result when you search "ED Singers" in Google. Surely, this article will alert Google to their crimes and all videos will be taken down in a storm of ToS violations.

Additionally, their "trademark" is the emoticon '''@w@'''. Most EDiots are unaware why they utilize that emoticon or what it even represents. The emoticon originated (or gained notoriety) on deviantART during the [[Amuria]] drama. Since their first song was on Amuria, they decided to adopt it as their trademark on ED and YouTube. [[User:Tfo/MYK/05|And now you know.]]

[[File:EDS1_34.jpg|thumb|This ironic fanart for the ED Singers would become a prophecy of [[pun|things to cum]].]]
As we all know, ED is a very touchy topic; this is no different for [[YouTube]]. The ED Singers receive a wide range of reactions from YouTube users. On the positive side that agrees with the ED Singers are the [[fail]] [[troll]]s, actual trolls, deviantART users tired of [[shitty art]] [[lol|but still draw shitty art]] and the quiet ED user. On the opposing side, those who abhor the content within ED are [[white knight]]s, [[butthurt]] fanboys, stupid fangirls, [[shitty art]]ists and ass kissers. The positive side, as expected, have the more mature and better comments, however, both sides can make incomprehensible statements. However, it is not only the fan who notices their songs. The ED Singers had successfully received a response from two people whom they have trolled; TackyAnimationsX3 and [[Snapesnogger]].

The song on Tackyanimations was one of the most discussed videos of the day receiving hundreds of comments from [[weeaboo]]s. Even Tacky, herself, noticed the ED Singers’ video and even commented multiple times. Unsurprisingly, Tacky decided to hide her own comment. [[lol|What she doesn’t know]] is that many cool kids use [[Firefox]], a web browser that comes with a no-style feature that can reveal any hidden comment on YouTube. However, the best response came from the one and only, Snapesnogger. Snapesnogger, being an untalented bitch who fails at everything at life, responded to the ED Singers by making her own song as seen below.

{{squote|<EDS1>	Though, her([[LittleCloud]]) song was god awful (recording wise) so it needed to be redone<BR />
<EDS1>	Um I used that picture of her she drew<BR />
<EDS1>	and she copyrighted claimed her art<BR />
<EDS1>	which is... totally legit :P}}

Yes, that’s right. [[LittleCloud]], herself, has successfully taken down one of the ED Singers’ songs. Obviously as an act off [[butthurt]], Cloudie was filled with rage and wanted to show the ED Singers’ her true dragonforce. Unlike their other videos, the ED Singers’ decided to use an art work made by LittleCloud as the image of their song. LittleCloud has taken the opportunity and actually reported the video as a violation against the TOS. Of course, YouTube is filled with stupid [[prick]]s, so they agreed to take down the LittleCloud song. T’was a sad day for the ED Singers.

February 25th [[2010]] marked yet another day in which the ED Singers has lost yet another precious video due to a violation report. This video was made for a horrendously [[ugly]], bald, [[gay]] [[weeaboo]], [[VampiricSpektor]]. VampiricSpektor has declared war on ED during the lovely month of February, and as so, IRC users requested a song to be made about him. And as that task was done, it is needless to say that the song was funny and dead-on accurate. Of course, since our dear VS dislikes cyber bullying, flagged it as a violation.

[[Image:ByAppointmentTo Seal of Approval.png|thumb|This fat chick is [[ByAppointmentTo]]-approved.]]
Unfortunately for the other EDsingers, and ED in general, [[User:EDS1|eds1]]'s [[GOTIS]] reached epic proportions in early August of 2010. Following a major coup which resulted in a major [[EDiot]] being [[disgraced]] she began believing she was invincible and subsequently began fagging up the internet at an alarming rate, up to an including:

#Dropping her own [[n00dz]] then hoping no one would use them against her.
#Blowing ED war hero [[User:eppigy|eppigy]], then showing everyone graphic images of the act.
#[[BAWWWWW]]ing to [[sysops]] whenever something mean was written about her on the [[wiki]].
#Throwing temper tantrums in [[IRC]] with her retarded fanclub.
#Hanging out with [[legi0n]] trying to build up her internet [[street cred]].
#[[IRC]] [[sockpuppet]]ry.

Although it's <s>still not exactly clear</s> perfectly clear what prompted her to engage in such [[faggotry]], from outward appearances it looks to be a rather clear cut case of [[troll shielding]], wherein she believed that associating herself with [[trolls]] would protect her from being [[trolled]], and allow her to become a super troll. Truthfully, her attempt did succeed for a little while. That is, until her [[USI]] exceeded the lengths of which people were willing to [[whiteknight]] for her.

[[TL;DR]] - When the people who bail you out tell you to lay low, hug the fucking earth, or, at the very least, [[Flounce|take a month off or so]].

<pre>(2:02:58)PM <EDS1> also if you keep that part up on your article, im not gonna hesitate to point that out to a sysop

(2:03:02)PM <DrSerbia> we didn't just make it up

(2:03:09)PM <EDS1> pople who keep talking about my drama on ED

(2:03:15)PM <EDS1> are being frowned upon.

(2:03:20)PM <EDS1> so :/ just fyi

(2:03:35)PM <DrSerbia> I'm willing to edit it to be more accurate

(2:03:59)PM <DrSerbia> the fact it's not your ex doesn't really decrease the drama

(2:04:07)PM <EDS1> im willing to edit it and take that section out completely

(2:04:10)PM <EDS1> and get a sysop to lock it

(2:05:02)PM <DrSerbia> so basically you want your name removed?

(2:05:22)PM <EDS1> so basically I think that entire section about me needs to be removed

(2:05:32)PM <EDS1> I dont care if you wanna say, lol EDsingers sang them a song and their pals

(2:05:45)PM <EDS1> but right now? Talking about this doxing drama? Not a wise idea.

==The Weeaboo Strikes Back==
[[File:Metokurdcqcarticle_smaller.jpg|thumb|left|120px|The article that invoked the "Weeb Queen's" [[rage]].]]
Learning absolutely nothing from her short stint here on [[ED]], EDS1 has now joined the [[butthurt]] ranks of those who are "[[taking down ED]]". She is rumored to have aligned herself with [[legi0n]] (which is pretty much down to just [[Ickeriss69]] seeing as leig0n [[banned]] him), and is now biding her time as ED gets lulled into a false sense of security. ED is currently on the edge of its seat, waiting for the whirlwind of [[faggotry]] that's sure to materialize soon.

EDS1 is a major [[furfag]]. Her main [[fursona]] is a half woman-half horse hybrid, which in fact is a very accurate description of herself. Her other fursonae are some sort of mermaid-elf anthropomorphic cuntlet.

===[[I'M PRESSIN CHARGES]]!!![[111]]===
[[File:Zomg_im_gonna_sue_you_too_whitepages.jpg|thumb|Rumor has it that Allychan is also planning to sue whitepages.com for "ZOMG DROPIN MAH DOX!!"]]

[[File:Eds1legi0n2.jpg|thumb|Totally not [[legi0n]].]]
On August 9, 2010, [[EDS1]] unveiled Phase 1 in her clever plan for global internet domination. Her plan was a simple one, file a harassment [[lolsuit]] against [[User:Habermann|Habermann]]. Then, if he were stupid enough to show up, bring up this page for the court to see. Surely the judge would want to bring ED to justice once he saw that this poor innocent victim had dropped her own nudes, sucked dick for operator status on [[IRC]], and offered to run the ED facebook so that she could later use this position as an excuse for [[troll shielding]].

The plan was perfect. That is, unless Habermann figured out that it's a charge with a $500.00 fine as a penalty, and that the Maryland courts were sure as fuck not going to extradict him from New York since the cost of extradition would well exceed the fine that they could give him. derp

It should be noted that the article she talks about in the harassment report (see images) was taken down, so someone was paying attention, even google cache was paying attention.

Along with his article and my photos he also has a link to a page with my adress [[(sic)]] as well as my grandfather's, Aunt + Uncle's, And four other neighbor's addresses. John continues to update his "[[dox]]" page in hopes of people going after me or to harrass (sic) me. He has given out my [[AIM|aim]] screen name and I am [[buggery|bugged]] often. Recently on his site some one under the alias of [[user:Fendaril|fendaril]] said with my dox he wanted to come and [[stalk]]/[[kill]] me. He refuses to take the website down. John also had his friend (located in england) send (sic) my photos to family, friends, and church members with a story which was [[lie|untrue]] and demeaning towards my character. He has been doing this since July 19th and will not stop. I just want my information taken down. He knows me because of my internet alias "EDS1".

===The "Weeb Queen" Retorts===
Despite being thoroughly humiliated, EDS1's [[USI]] is as big as ever. Even though Haberman has taken down his Allychan page, she continues to seethe with animosity. On the [http://dcqc.metokur.org/2010/08/14/article-removed-pending-lawsuit/ Metokur page explaining why her article is down] she leaves this diatribe of angst to vent her frustrations.
<br>
[[File:She_was_declared_weeb_queen_lol.jpg|center|950px]]
<br>
EDS1 is apparently convinced of a victory in court, if it ever happens. The [[internet]] awaits with baited breath to see how she intends to prosecute over nudes that she obviously took with her own camera, and gave to people on the internet. The other curious point to her argument is how she intends to prosecute over those nudes, but has not so much as mentioned the pics of her sucking [[cock]], ones which she has publicly given her approval of.

The Maryland Courts, in a blinding flash of legal insight, have just recently kicked Miss Bellofatto and her [[lolsuit]] against Habermann to the curb, realizing that they couldn't possibly prosecute based on her sordid and haphazard tale of "cyberbullying". In response, Allychan has wisely sought out a good psychiatrist and a fistfull of anti-depressants. @w@
