'''Austria''' is the capital of [[Germany]] and the only part of Germany where [[jews|literacy]] is pervasive.  The name "Austria" is the Latinisation of "Österreich", with "Öster" meaning "Eastern" and "Reich" meaning "Evil [[Nazi]] Empire".  The Germans decided to give its Capital City the name of their country because only Austrians knew how to read. All Germans leaders in every field are always without exception Austrian. 

Relying on Westerners' innate inability to get hold of a map, the sneaky Austrians confuse us saying they are 17 democratic separate countries, when in reality it is a Centralized Monarchy spanning from Hamburg to the [[anus|confines]] of [[Bruno|the Carpathian Mountains]] and [[do_not_want|beyond]].  
The North-Western third of Austria is in [[Europe]]. 

Austria has many institutions of [[drugs|higher learning]]. 

In 2001, upon [http://www.ovguide.com/tv_episode/thats-my-bush-season-1-episode-4-s-d-iayeaye-111753 some stupid missunderstanding], Austria attacked America for the third time in less than 90 years. The operation consisted of taking some subjects to the Austrian crown from the Bosnian Province, training them in their Hamburg province and going all kamikaze style like thy did with the Lusitania years ago. Since the Austrian Imperial Crown has always and invariably been controlled by the Jews (who live in Vienna, the ghetto hood of the city where you score MDMA) this even further proves that the [[Jews_did_WTC|Jews are responsible for 9/11]] 

Austria is the most <strike>evil</strike> <strike>awesome</strike> [[Nazi]] country in the world, seconded by  [[Germany|its own provinces]], and their national pastime entails training anti-Semitic [[Jews]] to take over and create a Germanic world. As planned Austria has now set their sights on the US, with their new version of deranged storm trooper Arnie, which according to Austrian technicians and watchmakers will be complete by [[2012]]. 
Synergetically, the Jews, who control Hollywood, have been seemingly very eager to turn him into a big star.

Austrian plans for Global Germanic Domination are founded on their deep rooted Paranoia:

==History==
Throughout much of history, the great Austrian Empire was the most powerful country in Europe (despite being almost wiped out by the Turks few times), having [[pwned]] the [[Bohemian]]s, the [[Poland|Poles]], the Croats, the Moravians, the Slovenes, the Hungarians (after being separated from Austria), the Other-garians, and many more. This status quo was destroyed in the year 1914 when a young aspiring [[Indie]] rock artist named Gavrilo Princip was kicked out of the band Franz Ferdinand. In a fit of [[angsty teen|angst]], Princip assassinated his fellow band members, thus precipitating [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. During this period, Austria also became romantically entangled with its [[homosexual]] neighbor Germany and in 1938, the two wed in an "Anschluss" (German for "civil union"). However, the [[Pope]] (a strong opponent of gay marriage) became enraged by this and immediately sent the [[Russia|Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]], to defeat and punish Germany and Austria for their sins of the heart.

Nevertheless, the Nazis would still have the last laugh when, in 2000, they seized power of the Austrian parliament in a bloody coup d'etat that killed many. Until 2002, Austria was ruled by
Führer Jörg Haider, until he got pwned by the [[Christian]] [[Conservative]]s under the evil dwarf Dr. Wolfgang Schüssel.

[[Image:haider_accident.jpg|thumb|Haider died in this car -- never suck your own dick if you have no autocruise]]

Later, in 2005, Haider's Freedom Party (FPÖ) was struck by [[drama]]. He fell out of love with his gay lover Heinz-Christian Strache, so they divorced, resulting in two equally shitty parties; Haider formed the BZÖ, and Strache kept the FPÖ. Only three years later, Jörg Haider had his last lulz by drunk-driving his car into a pillar after he visited a rent-boy raffle (nobody won Haider). Investigators found that [[autofellatio]] while driving was the main cause for the accident, due to stick-shift driving issues (automatic gearboxes are unpopular in Austria, called "unphallic"). Since the accident, at least 100% of the Austrians treat Haider as the next Führer who, just like the [[Hitler|original]] died a dramatic death. Haiders haunted soul is said to spook around in Viennese gay bars, making the darkroom experience of local homosexuals all the more erotic and enjoyable.  

==Culture==
Despite the long association with [[fascist]]s, Austria is a major center of [[drama]]. The capital of Vienna, especially, has been home to many artsy [[fag]]s, such as musicians (Mozart, Haydn, Schubert) and painters (Klimt, Hundertwasser, [[Hitler]]).

Aside from the arts, Austria is also well-known for its obsession with [[sex]]. In fact, all Austrians are complete sex addicts. This is illustrated in Freud's theory of [[pedophilia|psychosexual development of children]], and highlighted by the fact that 90% of Austria's food supply consists of [[cock|Vienna sausages]]. Austrians have even gone to the point of [http://www.snopes.com/photos/signs/austria.asp naming a city after sexual intercourse].

Austrians like all kinds of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%B6del Knödels], no matter if they are sweet, salty or sour. There are Marillenknödel(= Peach Knödels), Speckknödel(= Ham Knödels) and Käseknödel(= Cheese Knödels), not to forget Leberknödel(=Liver Knödels) and Germ-Knödels being the "gelée royale" for breeding the new and powerful Hitler 2.0.. [[Some argue]] that the testicle-like shape improves the rate of breeding a Führer.

The national anthem of Austria is a corny song called Edelweiss. Edelweiss is a plant from somewhere in the Alps that is proven to be the most powerful aphrodisiac in the world. It was used by Emperor Francis I, who had [[at least 100|at least 16]] children with Empress [[your mom|Maria Theresa]]. 


Though currently subject to [[lulz|international condemnation]], the imprisonment and rape of family members is a long-celebrated Austrian pastime, believed to have its roots in the early Middle Ages, when local lords would lock up their daughters in underground basement complexes - complete with electronically sealed doors - in order to [[rape|father]] as many children as their shriveled members would permit.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7373689.stm]

==Austrian army==

Austria lost two world wars and has been [[butthurt|pouting]] ever since. Today Austria is a neutral country, limiting its defense forces to border patrol activities, called "manhunts", or, "nigger-safaris". Illegal immigrants apprehended at the border are subject to rape and cannibalism, usually in this order.   

Since the monarchy, when Transylvania was part of the Habsburg empire, Austrians are obsessed with vampires. That's why Austrian recruits are required to rasp their fangs pointy for "psychological warfare". What's also required for recruits "serving" in the Austrian army is providing [[ass]] to superiors for [[buttsex]], but this clause is rarely invoked -- all cadre personell is impotent from chronic alcoholism. (You can't make this shit up.) 

[[Nobody cares|Austria invented Glocks.]]


==Languages==

Although [[Australian]] is widely spoken, the official language of Austria is, in fact, Austrian. The [[Nazi]]s have often attempted to claim Austria's language as [[German]], but their lies were finally exposed by President Barack [[Obama]] in April 2009, when Obama [http://townhall.com/blog/g/a4ec082f-bc10-49b2-8415-dce5d391e1c2 spoke at length about the Austrian language] (admitting, however, that he still has to learn it.)

==Sports==
[[Image:Fritzl snake.jpg|thumb|Austrian ARAA uniform, consisting of Rape-Bandana and Insemination-Eye-Tool.]]
Austria [[pwn|pwns]] at skiing, and completely fails at everything else. The fact that Austrian sport reporters still cite a single [[soccer]] game Austria won by accident) as the greatest moment in <strike>Austria's</strike> Australia's soccer history is pathetic, especially for a non-[[The Jewnited States of Americunts|American]] team.

Austria is also venue of the upcoming '''UEFA European Football Championship (Of [[Fail]])'''

Another well known Austrian passtime: ARAA ([[Fun|Abduction Rape Assault and Abuse]]), has been discovered recently. Nearly every Austrian plays this game regularly in their basement, with ''Elisabeth Fritzl'' and ''Natascha Kampusch'' being [[attention whore|willing participants]]. Dont forget the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linz_sisters Linz sisters] who rated their ARAA experience as [[awesome]]!
