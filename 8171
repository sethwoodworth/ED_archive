The Crusades were a <s>ridiculously</s> appropriately long series of wars that continue on today over control of Jerusalem, and one of the greatest dramas in history. The modern version of the Crusades is a [[Holocaust|myth]] invented by Jews to explain everything that happens in the Middle East. According to this version, Muslims hate Christians solely because of a war that happened 1,000 years ago, and America and Israel have done nothing bad in the last 50 years.

===Myth===

The Crusades were an [[Old|ancient]] version of the War in [[Iraq]], a battle between [[Catholic]]s and [[Muslim]]s. Except back then the [[Catholic]]s were the [[terrorist]]s(And [[Ireland|most]] would argue, still are). Another important difference between the two is that back in the olden times thousands of years ago [[noone]] cared if eleventy zillion pilgrims were killed, as opposed to the one bazillion killed in [[Iraq]] which [[Liberal]]s always bitch about.

The Crusades were started by the [[Catholic|Crapolic]] Church, who wanted to go [[pwn]] the Muslims for living in [[Middle East|the Holy Land]], the place where [[Raptor Jesus|Jesus]] was born. So basically, they wanted to rule the world by committing acts of [[Terrorism]], raping women, children and anything else that moved. [[Some argue]] they deserved it, a claim aided by the fact that they were Arabs, but then the Crusaders attacked [[Greece|Byzantium]] which weakened the Orthodoxy and gave rise to [[Turkey|Islamic dominance in Europe]]. In the end, as we all can see, the [[Catholics]] got [[pwn|pwnz0rd]].

It is just recently that the [[Arab|A-Rab]]s have had their revenge with the help of [[W|Osama Bin Laden]]. With this knowledge at hand, it is clear that the [[Catholic]]s deserve it and every shred of agony they get, is called [[Karma]].

===Fact===

The Crusades were planned by a cabal of Jews from Venice, to control a port city across from the Strait of Suez, import [[hookers and blow]] into Europe, and amass [[Jew golds]]. [[At least 100]] years later, the Muslims recaptured the city and the Jews blamed it all on the Catholic church. Later still, Muslims conquered half of Europe and foolishly spared their tormentors. But that doesn't count. All of this happened about 1,000 years ago, and has nothing to do with the modern Middle East whatsoever, except for the last part, which, supposedly, is called [[Karma]].

It is a little known fact that the Crusaders were actually government contractors doing advance [[oil|scouting]] for [[Dick Cheney|Halliburton]].
