Iamli3
[[Image:Iamli3cries.png|thumb|400px|Nobody likes iamLi3 and nobody gives a fuck about it.]]
'''iamli3''', aka ''[http://www.facebook.com/michael.a.meszaros  Michael Attila MÃ©szaros]'', is an 18 year old ''(December 14, 1991)'', self-[[obsessed|depressed]], admitted [[zoophile|dogmongler]] from [[Canada|Calgary, AB]]. Most commonly known on [http://www.youtube.com/user/iamli3 YouTube] for his [[attention whore|attention-seeking attitude]], and his habit of spelling like a six year old. [[furry|Furries]] criticized him for creating [[animal|a four legged canine fursona]], because non-anthropomorphic animal characters will make them look like zoophiles, which will attract trolls. The other reason for this [[hate|criticism]] was that iamli3 made it [[obvious|very much aware]] that he liked to take it out of [[real]], [[castration|neutered]] [[animals]], unlike [[Dalhusky|plushophiles]]. Despite possessing a [[fursona]], iamLi3 considered himself a non-[[furry]], refusing to [[yiff]] with any [[human]] computer user, because  '''iamli3''' has a serious [[mental disorder]] whereby searches and attempts to date beasts on the Internet, although dogs do not have capability of using the [[Internet]]. He suffers from [[anthropophobia]], causing no end of [[sex|abstination]] and [[sockpuppet|social]] isolation (thus [[schizophrenia]] and worse still, [[autism]]). He appears to be the most prime candidate for becoming the next [[Cory Williamson]], and believes that [[buy a dog|buying a dog]] is the best answer for a sexual relationship.

== Sexuality ==
iamli3 is totally [[lie|not gay]], despite having [[sex]] with a countless number of male [[dogs]], of which he did not even [[own]] ''("keep away from my children!" is a common message by anonymous housewives on [[YouTube]])''. 


== [http://www.sodahead.com SodaHead] ==
iamLi3 registered on a blog website where everyone makes journal and waiting for people to reply with some opinions, most of them are polls. Here iamLi3 goes around looking for Beastality and Furry related topics. He gets angry if anyone posts anything negative on beastality.

== ZooUnity ==
iamLi3 is one of the most active users of the almost dead silent website called [http://zoophilia.co.cc/ ZooUnity] which is the first Internet foundation for Zoophilia. After the site's guestbook had been vandalized by trolls, iamLi3 got all butthurt and gave a brief history what he experienced on YouTube, however he was misinformed by [[MrDisambiguation]] who told him he doxxed a troll which of course never happened, because [[MrDisambiguation|JuggaloBirdy]] is full of himself and wants to think he's the best [[furfag]] of all time, he's probably attempting to take away [[wolfeedarkfang|Wolfee Darkfang]]'s role of leadership. However iamLi3 doesn't realize he could be imprisoned for years if he tries to fuck a dog or just looking at beast porn, because in Canada it's illegal, but he ignores all that and shouts his Zoosexual Pride all over the Internet on different sites. It is 100% proven{{citation needed}} that Michael is currently in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Perhaps on [[prison|holiday]]? On his [[Facebook]] he got excited over the [[wtf|thought]] of [[Gay|cocks dipped in shit]], as he [[fact|supposedly]] wet his pants, he posted up an image that he lives not too far from [http://www.canpages.ca/page/BC/prince-george/dionne-glass/1869210.html  Dionne Glass]. His 5 weeks old [[necro|necrophilic]] mother confessed to his butt rape in [[pakistan|PG]]. iamll3, in love with [[Japanese|Okami]] [[lie|dislikes]] [[golden shower]] but only because they prefer [[shit|cock]]. WARNING: iamll has two lls, iamli3 has [[tits|three]], if you did not realise this, you should go [[commit suicide|spank]] yourself as you have violated ED's second rule (originally intended on ridding the world of [[ugly|beautiful]] [[bestiality|Megan Fox]] [[transsexual|girls]]. Everyone has iamli3's password, I repeat, everyone. He sucks so bad not even [[trolls]] can be bothered to attend to him, though we at ED are sure some black person, [[black|young]], [[president|intelligent]], [[wanker|pretty]] [[wigger|woman]] will one day use his password and destroy his much loved pages that will instantly be replaced by ever more [[gross|lovely]] [[bestiality|animal]] caricatures. Have fun deleting his LP videos, [[script kiddie|hackers]]!
