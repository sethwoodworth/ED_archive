Keyboard Whore
The '''Keyboard Whore''' is a [[Meme|meme]] that spawned from [[b|/b/]] on November 16, because [[Battletoads|Battletoads]] was getting old, and [[b|/b/]]tards were getting bored. Its a good alternative to [[Put_Shoe_On_Head|put shoe on head]] since most [[whore|whores]] from [[Russia|Russia]] and [[Philippines|Philippines]] can't afford to buy shoes.
It started with a post by [[anon|anonymous]] of a Camwhore with a [[keyboard]] on her head and part of the chat log as part of the screencap.

[[b|/b/]]tards started flooding MyCams (and other [[Camwhore|camwhore]] sites) once again, and tating the videos were pre-recorded and looped and demanding that the [[Camwhore|camwhores]] "do something crazy no one would ever think of doing in a pre-recorded video, like, hum... putting your keyboard on your head", or just pretending to be some [[Sick_Fuck|sick]] fetishist that could not get off if a woman was not wearing a Keyboard hat. 

This quickly became a raid with [[b|/b/]]tard saying they are from [[Ebaums|e/b/aumsworld]] asking for some keyboard fun. Even if it got INSTANTLY BORING, it lasted more than a week and some of the [[b|/b/]]tards started encountering increased difficulty on getting them to indulge on the [[Anal|sweet pleasures]] of keyboard action. Also, [[Demotivator|demotivators]] ensued [[For_Great_Justice|for great justice]]. [[Lulz|Lulz]] ensued, of course. And lasted a good 15 minutes.

Update: In the wee hours of December 2nd, everyone from Ebaumsworld raided MyCams again. There were several [[winnar|epic wins]], keyboard-on-head-wise. The epitome of the raid, however, came when several of the [[camwhore|performers]] went [[batshit_insane|batshit insane]] and cussed the raiders out in some strange [[%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80|language]]. One even managed to [[spam|spam]] herself into oblivion. Epic [[lulz|lulz]] and [[Demotivator|demotivators]] ensued.
