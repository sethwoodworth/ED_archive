Frequently while exploring the vast [[shithole]] that is the [[internet]], you’ll come across [[crazy]] people.  Crazy people are in no short supply to be found and usually can be turned into [[lulz]] without much effort, thanks to their preference for turning their crazy into works of “[[art]],” be they [[Shitty Art|drawings]], [[Emo|poetry]], [[YouTube|videos]] or [[Earrape|music]].

But very rarely will you come across a crazy so beyond crazy that the creations they produce go beyond being [[funny]] and are truly [[Swap.avi|frightening]] in displaying how absolutely [[batshit]] [[insane]] this person is.

==Targ: The Comic==
In '''Targ''', Targ is our [http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/targ4.gif cat murdering], [http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/targ1.gif pedophilic], [[schizophrenic]] tortured hero who lives in a world of [http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/targ9.gif obscure, decades old machinery] that are used against him.  Refusing to acknowledge his own [[Crazy|mental instability]], he has created an elaborate idea of everyone in the world, including [[you]], yes [[YOU]], [[Paranoid|is out to get him]].  But he’s completely sane.  Not crazy.

*[http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ21.gif He breaks a truck load of computer equipment] and for completely unrelated reasons, [http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/targ6.gif can’t hold down a job].  Not crazy.
*[http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/targ14.gif He tracks the number of teeth in his zippers] and when one breaks, he blames this mysterious group of dozens of people after him.  Not crazy.
*[http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/targ14.gif He counts every single thread on his velcro straps], checking for decreases in velcro strength.  

Not crazy.


===Peter Perp===
'''Peter Perp''' is the [[incest|sister]] comic strip to Targ that goes behind the scenes of organized stalking to tell the story from their point of view.  Basically it's just a big list of various things Eleanor has made up to explain her insanity.

According to Peter Perp, these organized stalking groups have the power to:

*[http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/pperp9.gif Release people from prison]
*[http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/pperp18.gif Create elaborate technology for the purpose of messing with someone]
*[http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/pperp17.gif Hide groceries]
*[http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/pperp15.gif Create more machines to screw with people]
*[http://www.multistalkervictims.org/targ/pperp5.gif Make people homeless]


===The Art===
One of the most horrifying parts of this series of terror comics is the art.  The art is actually made on on [http://www.bitstrips.com bitstrips.com], and is not original artwork..  However, a brief trip to [http://www.bitstrips.com bitstrips] will show that there is a much larger selection of eyes to choose from that aren’t the unblinking, staring, dead, dead eyes that bore into your skull used for every character in the strip.

==The Author==
The author of Targ is Eleanor [[White]], a [[Victim complex|completely innocent]], [[Lie|completely sane]] self proclaimed victim of organized [[stalking]].  

Every minute of the day she is under surveillance by evildoers plotting to ruin her day in any way possible.  These people have absolute [[control]] over her electrical appliances, including her [[computer]].  Yet they have allowed her to make dozens of these “comics” and compile a [[website]] filled to the brim with ambiguous and unverifiable “evidence.”

If this group of stalkers is so powerful and reach is so long, [[Logic|wouldn’t it be easier to just shut down her computer every time she tries to tell the world about her plight]]?  Oh never mind, that’s just crazy talk.

One [[Anonymous|Anon's]] tale of phone calls from Eleanor:
{{quote|She was our group stalking gem. A few of us were able to truly appreciate the poetic nature of her ability to turn ordinary words into something disturbing. She was convinced that the legal system and the police were all connected to breeding cults that were after here and everyone else. When she would call her voice was calm and her question was normal. This lasted all of maybe 20 seconds before she started to speak faster and get more agitated, and her thoughts process began to center around rape and rape like activities. The best way to handle her is to just let her go off for about 5 - 10 minutes, and then she would calm down and get off the phone. I truly welcomed her calls because each and every time she taught me a new interesting term for rape.
These are some highlights:

They are all on my lawn circlejerking for the breeding cults<br>
New Zealand is full of freeholin' (rape)<br>
Immigrants are here to wethole us (rape)<br>
It is like swimming through a chocolate cake mix out there (she hates brown people)<br>
Celebrities are in the back bellyhumping for the breeding cults (rape)<br>
Chinese rack (this was used in the context of rape)<br>

I used to try and take as many notes of the poetic rape language she used during the calls, but she would just get so frantic it was hard to keep up.}}

Here's a video on Eleanor's website of someone sitting in their car in a normal neighborhood and calling everyone she sees a stalker.

==The Reason for the Crazy==
There is a simple answer for every bit of “organized stalking” Eleanor encounters.  She’s [[crazy]].  [[No shit|Well obviously]].  But REALLY genuinely crazy.  [[Multiple personality disorder]] crazy.  She becomes someone else, fucks with some her stuff, then reverts to “Eleanor” with no memory of it happening and suddenly [[OMG]] THERE’S HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AFTER ME.

But why do all this?  Why go to such lengths, spend so much money, just to screw with someone?  Targ’s answer is simple: [[What|because they can]].  That’s it.  Targ/Eleanor has no secrets, no "theories," no aliens hiding in her basement or undeniable proof that [[Jews did 9/11|9/11]] was a [[Reptoid]] conspiracy.  [[No|All this money and effort is put into screwing with Targ because they can]].

Not crazy.
