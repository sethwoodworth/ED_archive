A '''desktop''' can mean one of two things: your [[computer]] (which it's keyboard is sticky) desktop, which is actually inside your computer [[windows|operating system]] on the screen, or the physical desk you rest your computer on. Often on [[4chan]]'s /[[b]]/, there are threads requesting that pics of both types of desktops are posted, resulting in some rather [[lulz]]y observations and discussion, and providing an [[rape|insight]] into the [[ruin|conditions]] in which /b/tards are living, although that depends if it's the cluttered Windows desktop full of shit [[program]] shortcuts, or the cluttered conditions in which these slobs are living (although you can sometimes see the computer desktop and the actual desktop in the same pic, [[lawl]]).

Conditions that /b/tards live in range from the haunts of [[alcoholic]] [[slob]]s to the dwellings of pristine, clean, [[faggot]]y stylish [[metrosexual]] [[cunt]]s who are cleaner even than most [[women]]. Neither of these conditions are ideal for [[secks|getting laid]]. Whilst your average girl will be disgusted with the rats and maggots to be found [[lurk]]ing in the former, they'll also be kinda freaked out by the [[anal]] retentiveness of the latter. [[The best]] compromise is to get your woman to do [[epic win|all your fucking housework for you]], because not only do they enjoy that and having all three of their major orifices used as [[hole]]s for which to stick your [[penis]] in at any time you feel like, it allows you to get on with moar [[serious business|serious matters]].

[[Image:1214757315375.jpg|thumb|[[faggot|Someone]] is not [[man]] enough not to take alcoholic drinks that don't have 10 tons of sugar added to them. Also, note the [[shit]]ty [[music]] taste.]]
