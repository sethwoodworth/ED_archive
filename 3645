Having A Wonderful Time

'''Having A Wonderful Time''' is an [[internet]] [[meme]] which refers to the song "Living In The Sunlight, Loving In The Moonlight" by novelty act legend Tiny Tim. The Internets were first made aware of its existence when it was featured in the pilot episode of ''[[spengbab|Spongebob Squarepants]]'', in which Spongebob makes meals for [[over 9,000]] anchovies. From there it remained dormant until it became a decent [[YTMND]] meme, whencefrom it became a shitty [[YTMND]] meme, until finally spiraling downward in flames like a helicopter in distress to become an unspeakably fail [[JewTube]] meme.

It is widely held to be the gayest song ever recorded, like a car made of Ballroom Blitz colliding with a wall made of [[Hard Gay|Hard Gay's]] cover version of "[[Village_People|YMCA]]".

==The Lyrics==

<i>I'm so happy! AHA! Happy go lucky me!<br>
I just go my way, living everyday!<br>
I don't worry! Worrying don't agree,<br>
Things that bother you, never bother me!<br>

Things that bother you never bother me<br>
I feel happy and fine! AHA!<br>
Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight<br>
Having a wonderful time!<br>
Haven't got a lot, I don't need a lot<br>
Coffee's only a dime!<br>
Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight,<br>
Having a wonderful time!<br>

Just take it from me, I'm just as free as any daughter.<br>
I do what I like, just what I like, and how I love it!<br>

I'm right here to stay, when I'm old and gray,<br>
I'll be right in my prime!<br>
Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight,<br>
Having a wonderful time!<br>

Just take it from me, I'm just as free as any daughter.<br>
I do what I like, just what I like, and how I love it!<br>

I'm right here to stay, when I'm old and gray,<br>
I'll be right in my prime,<br> 
Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight,<br>
Having a wonderful time!<br></i>

==The (Unbelievably Gay) Legend==
Herbert Khaury (aka Tiny Tim) was born on 12th April 1932 to a family which was half Lebanese and half Polish Jew, which criminology and [[you|the world at large]] would come to know only as [[1980s|"The Fratellis"]]. They considered [[Abortion|flushing him down the toilet]], but as no toilet was feasibly [[goatse|capacious]] enough for this task they instead decided to [[Bondage|tie him to a chair]] until [[Chris_Forcand|Chunk]] came and rescued him and they went off together in search of [[cock|One-Eyed Willy's]] treasure.

After this he changed his name to Tiny Tim, and became a musical archivist. However, after performing for change in bars for [[lesbian|women in sensible shoes]] who [[lesbian|take the other bus]] to [[lesbian|Wimbledon]] to [[lesbian|dine at the Y]], he realized that his trademark act (which consisted of looking like a gigantic terrifying son of a bitch while playing a tiny ukulele and singing in a delicate little girl voice) generated more lulz than [[Caturday]] and that awesome [[JewTube]] of those [[9-11|planes flying into that building]] put together. The rest is [[Chris_Crocker|shockingly gay]] history.

==As A Meme==
Having A Wonderful Time as a [[meme]] is one of the most soul-draining pits of [[fail]] ever to plague the [[internet|tubes]]. This is not, by any means, because it is a bad meme. The song itself is a novelty music evergreen right up there with "[[Daniele_Fiorenza|The Monster Mash]]" and "[[Animal_cruelty|Poisoning Pigeons In The Park]]", and will always be concentrated [[win]]. The reason is rather that it is such a childishly foolproof [[meme]] to pull off correctly, and yet has STILL [[Hamtaro%27s_Theory|degenerated]] into a cesspool of [[unfunny]] due to [[YTMND]] and [[YouTube]] being populated by people who rank below children and fools.

===How To Achieve Win For Dummies===
'''Category 1 Win:''' Simply take an animated GIF of a person or fictional character (who is largely perceived as being overly straight-laced or butch) acting either by accident, [[This_Looks_Shopped|shooping]] or contrivance behaving in a camp or [[gay|frolicsome]] manner. Set it to the above song.

'''Category 2 Win:''' Take an animated GIF of a person or fictional character who is by accident, intention, [[This_Looks_Shopped|shooping]] or contrivance doing something inappropriate or horrifying that does not easily sit with the light-hearted nature of the above song. Set it to the above song.

Sounds simple, doesn't it? Almost TOO simple.

How does bear know what wonderful time is? Like this.

===Examples of FAIL===

[http://godotsonlyadime.ytmnd.com/ Godot Is Having A Wonderful Time.]

Look! It's the line "Coffee's only a dime", looped over and over! Obviously that's not going to make you put a housebrick through your monitor after five fucking seconds, because GODOT FROM ''[[Phoenix Wright]]'' DRINKS COFFEE! LOL AMIWRIGHT? Special honors for fail in this [[YTMND]], because the uploader couldn't figure out how to animate and simply made Godot flash on and off in a [[party hard|two frame loop]] to try and fool people.

Yes, I'm [[serious_business|serious]].

[http://re4wonderful.ytmnd.com/ Leon Is NOT Having A Wonderful Time!]

ROFLLOLZ! Do you see what I did there? I took the original meme and put "NOT" into it! It is funny because it is the OPPOSITE of the original meaning! [[PROFIT]]!

[[Facepalm]].

[[image:Wtjoker.jpg]]

[http://wonderfultimejoker.ytmnd.com/ The Joker Is Having A Wonderful Time.]

The original joke depicted a guy spinning on an office chair. If I upload ANOTHER picture of a person spinning on an office chair, IT WILL BE JUST AS [[unfunny|FUNNY!]]

Some was sitting around, smoking the [[Drug#Cannabis|wacky chewbaccy]], and thought "Dude, I should like, cut out pieces of ''Star Wars'' pictures. Then put them in front of a picture of the Death Star. That'd be so [[shit|funny]]." 333 views later, it had 3/5 stars.

===So What Did We Learn Today?===
*The [[internet]] ruins everything. If it had existed when the classics were being laid down, then "Why did the chicken cross the road" would have been funny for precisely half a week. After that we would have had [[Bitches_Don't_Know|"Bitches don't know bout the other side"]], [[A_Cat_Is_Fine_Too|"A chicken is fine too"]], [[Apples_Bear|"How does chicken know about the other side"]], [[A_winner_is_you|"A chicken is you"]]. [[Buy_A_Dog|"Buy a chicken"]], [[Chocolate_Rain|"Chicklet Rain"]], [[Centipede_filled_vagina|"Chickens in my vagina"]], [[How_Do_I_Shot_Web|"How do I shot chicken"]], [[I_Am_In_Your_Base_Killing_Your_D00ds|"I'm in your base killing your chickens"]], [[Battletoads|"Is this Battlechickens"]], and so on and so on and so on until people would vomit their own lungs up at the mere mention of motherfucking chickens.

*The inhabitants of the internet are [[fucktard|unable to follow simple instructions]] to such a degree that if all of them decided to commit [[an hero|mass suicide]], sysops would need to be on hand to point out which end of the gun to use.
