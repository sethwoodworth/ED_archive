[http://www.shorty.com/bonsaikitten/ Bonsai Kitten] was a website built in December 2000 by an [[MIT]] graduate student known only as [[azn|Dr. Michael Wong Chang]]. Featuring how-to instructions and [[Caturday|photos of cute little kitties]] stuffed into glass bottles and having their assholes glued up, the resulting [[butthurt|shit-storm]] caused [[v&]]s and still [[rage]]s till this day.

The site was first published on December 20, 2000. Obviously mocked up photos and equipment were presented in a semi professional fashion, but like most [[satire]], it was lost on the [[retarded|stupid]]. Fake testimonials and instructions on how to stuff a kitten into a jar and keep it alive for a normal life span stirred up so much [[hippy]] rage that [http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/bonsai.asp these] viral emails made MIT cave to the growing controversy [[pussy|only 11 days]] later. The site jumped from server to server for a couple of weeks until finally settling on [[Rotten.com]]'s server. Content was added to [[trolling|rub in]] the loudest complaints coming in via hate-mail and online petitions. Examples include adding a children's section after people started complaining that their kids wouldn't know it was fake.

Eventually, the FBI stepped in.

==V& and aftermath==

In February the FBI subpoenaed MIT for all information related to the site in an attempt to make the [[Internet]] [[serious business]]. The attempt was a [[fail]] since no laws were actually broken. Of course the law has never stopped [[Christians|crusaders]] from [[BAWWW|crusading]] before. As the debate turned to freedom of speech, animal activists claim that the site encourages animal cruelty, ([[OH NOES]]!), and there by doesn't qualify for the first amendment. The webmaster has set up a [[mailing list]] to broadcast hatemail to subscribers. Despite its [[old meme]] status, [[PETA]] still sends out [[Shit no one cares about|online petitions]] to this day.
