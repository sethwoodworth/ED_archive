A '''Concerned Mother''' is a man, woman, person, or otherwise, that complains to [[website]]s, writers, book publishers, [[television]] networks, city councils, or other [[parents]] under the guise of being concerned about their [[children]], despite knowing deep down that letting a [[child]] learn responsibility is an important part of his or her growth. Scientific studies show that concerned mothers are actually mothers only 26% of the time, the other 99% are [[conservatives]] who get [[angry]] at things their children might [[lol]] at that they haven't had the chance to inspect first. Sometimes, these mothers just [[fail]] to accept that their 22-year-old "child" is perfectly capable of [[Mr. Hands|handling sexual material]] and became capable at the age of 7 when he started looking at [[porn|pr0nz]].

Concerned mothers usually believe they have some [[Over 9000|inconceivable]] level of maturity, which is exhibited by sending out numerous letters of complaints (which are handwritten whenever possible). These letters of grievance are normally very well thought-out and organized lists of [[butthurt]]. Science has proven that every concerned mother is a Jew, regardless of their actual race, color or ability to accept [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as their personal savior. Because of this, their children have no other option than to become [[Lol-cow|tremendous sources of lolz]].

Despite their efforts, concerned mothers never actually influence their kids to do well. Many children with concerned mothers go on to do drugs, play video games and [[trying too hard|try way too hard]] to partake in social activities excluding their mothers, like [[4chan]], [[friends|friend]]-having and [[sex]]. Those who do not break away before they turn [[old people|old]] will usually get [[trolled]] for being a [[retard|momma's boy]]. After which, they generally cry to their mom who will assail the troll with e-mail requesting personal info to discuss punishments with [[your mom]]. This will probably cause the child to eventually [[Virginia Tech Massacre|shoot up his school and kill himself]] because he knows he can never return to that [[Twilight]] chat room to discuss the intricacies of Stephenie Meyer's characters, like [[Mary Sue|Bella]] and [[Fag|Edward]] as he will get [[pwnt]] again to an even greater extent. Contrary to popular belief, a skilled troll will not [[troll's remorse|feel bad]] if he has adhered to [[I did it for the lulz|the code]]. If the troll feels remorse, then it probably wasn't an actual trolling.  Undoubtedly, it was a civil conversation that the troll in question had pleasantly corrected the victim on his spelling or grammatical mistake, to ensure that future generations will not continue to [[epic fail]] in such a manner.  This will still cause the concerned mother and the overprotected child to feel [[butthurt]].

For reference, this is usually how a conversation goes down prior to a concerned mother's letter.

==Their Crazy Antics==
Concerned mothers are well recognized on internet [[forum|forums]], letters to someone, [[weblog|weblogs]], or on the [[lulznews|newz]].  They usually write about how [[Bitch|disturbed]] they are about modern day or something they witnessed, and usually expect someone completely unrelated to fix it or do something about it. For example:

|Dear School Principal, I am a concerned mother who recently witnessed something quite disturbing. I walked into the room and saw my 16-year-old son watching a show called "The Simpson's Show" or "[[The Simpsons]] Family." despite its title, this was not a family show.  The scene I found horrifying was when one of the characters, named Bartholomew "Bart" Simpson, [[Rape|tapped]] [[tranny|another]] female character on the shoulder. I found this [[goatse|excessively sexual]] and I do not want children being exposed to this kind of sexuality. I would appreciate it if you could do something about this or discourage your students from viewing "The Simpson's Show" |Mrs. Anonymous

|Dear Television Network, I am a mother of two worried about an advertisement recently shown on your channel. This commercial depicted two children playing a game of soccer when one [[fail|slips]] and gets a cut. A [[whore|lady]] then puts the product, labeled "neo spor in" on the cut.  This commercial is inappropriate and [[lol|violent]] and [[fat|I do not want my children learning to play sports]] and possibly bleed, and expect me to help them when they do. Sports and the injuries that can be caused by them are dangerous and should not be encouraged by your network.|Mrs. Anonymous

|Dear Television Network, I witnessed [[goatse|something very shocking and disturbing]] while watching television with my children in [[an hero|an commercial break]]. I was so shocked that I immediately unplug the television and told the kids to stay well away from it until I think its safe. Well This advertisement displayed [[spellcheck|Santa Claws]] giving a [[loli|young girl]] a bottle of [[cock|coca cola]] followed by a [[almost raped|hug]] after she asked for a bottle of [[cocaine|coke]] for Christmas. Not Only can my children not watch TV but now they are now [[rape|terrified of Santa]] and want to stay [[jail|locked up in a safe place]] until Christmas is over, because they are scared that Santa is going to [[rape]] them. Please immediately remove this advertisement before it [[Butthurt|frightens]] or [[Offended|offends]] any more people and children.|Mrs. Anonymous

|Hello, I am contacting you on behalf of my Son.  I was [[cry|told]] by my son that all of [[you]] were [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|mean and vulgar]] on this [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|website]] and [[Unrealistic expectations|I want you to remove all of the content that my son might not like!]]  If you do not do this I will [[Spellcheck|persue]] legal action against you because I do not want you [[retard|corrupting my son's mind]] with your [[Win|vulgar ways]], if he starts [[win|using the internet]] he might be exposed to things that give him too much [[intelligence]] and he might start [[puberty|getting out of my control.]]  He might even [[straight|show interest in Females with a sexual intent.]] This is my ultimatum to you, and [[Unrealistic Expectations|expect you to follow it.]]|Mrs.Anonymous



|Dear BretRockz My son has given me [[dox|your email address]] and told me to warn you about you [[lulz|bullying him]] on [[Lulz|the high school musical chat room that he likes to chat on.]] This is totally [[Goatse|inappropriate]] and very [[cry|disrespectful]] and [[butthurt|hurtful]]. You made my son cry for [[at least 100|64]] minutes straight last night. He told me that you called him a [[Truth|loser and a retard]] because he had [[fail|misspelled]] one of the [[faggot|characters]] names in the [[pron|movie]]. This is the [[chat log]] that he saved.<br>
HSMFanKid: Zack Efron did such a [[Blowjob|good job]] in the new high school musical 3 movie. <br>
BretRockz: his name is spelled zac not zack, retard. <br>
HSMFanKid: You can't [[truth|insult]] me!! thats against the rules!! I am [[cry|telling my mother right now]].<br>
BretRockz: go tell [[your mom]]my, loser.<br>
HSMFanKid has [[quitting IRC forever|gone offline]]. <br>
[[Lie|My son is not a "retard"]] [[Spellcheck|He had put a K on the end of Zac.]] Easy mistake to make as Zac can be spelled in 2 different ways of Zack or Zac, either way they are both pronounced the same and it is a easy mistake to make. I am very shocked and and [[offended]] by your behavior to my son. [[X is not your personal army|I need you to]] [[Unrealistic expectations|reply apologizing to my son and give me your parents phone number so I can explain to them what you did to my son on this chat room.]] I also need to discuss a [[buttsecks|punishment]] for you with them.|Mrs. Anonymous

|Dear Mr. Flynn, I am writing to you on behalf of one of my son's classmates, Franklin "Frank" Peters. Frank [[Reacharound|turned around]] and began to talk to my son about a [[sex|hot]] [[loli|girl]] and how pretty her [[vagoo|hair]] was. Please remove "Frank" from your classroom immediately, for fear my son will become a [[faggot|homosexual]].|Mrs. Anonymous

|Dear Ms. Francine Waters, My son came to your house to sell his Boyscout's cookies [[last Thursday|last Sunday]]. Let it be noted that you were wearing a denim "mini" miniature skirt, a sea-green mock-turtleneck sweater, and brown rubber sandals, or, as the black person may call them, flip-flops. This outfit is [[slut|extremely revealing]] and you have exposed my son to far too much of your body. [[unwarranted self-importance|I expect you to go out and buy a suit]] that actually covers your ankles. Also, please [[do it faggot|consider]] wearing colors that are not Day-Glo, as that [[semen|sea-green]] could have passed as florescent.|Mrs. Anonymous}}</center>

==[[Bullshit|Paranoia]]==
Some parents are over paranoid when it comes to their kids doing everyday normal things that every other kid does but the unfortunate one is stuck with a parent who is over protective. For example:
{{quote|Little Jimmy don't go past our driveway, you might get kidnapped, I don't care if we live in one of the safest neighborhoods in the suburbs nor do I care that we have [[at least 100]] windows on our house so I can easily see your every move." |Mrs. Anonymous|Color=Brown}}


'''The paranoia can worsen as the child grows older and starts doing things that an [[bitch|overly concerned mother]] thinks are too dangerous such as:'''
[[Image:concernedmum4.jpg|[[Alien]]'s [[x y is x|concerned mother is concerned]]|thumb]]

Also, concerned mothers' paranoia is a leading cause of [[anti-lulz]] and [[emo kids]]. But most sheltered kids will find their way to a computer and spend their time writing in angst against the ideals of a concerned mother.
