'''Cake'''. It is apparently NOT a lie. [[NOM NOM NOM|Cake is delicious and thus... you must eat it]]. As the [[Shakespeare|great /b/ard]] once postulated: 

<br/>
{{quote|'''It is delicious cake... you must eat it!'''| /b/}}
<br/>

Since time immemorial, [[B|people]] have wanted their cake and they have wanted to eat it too. Oh, but if only life was that simple. Unfortunately, there always seems to be [[FBI|something]], or Jew, trying to prevent [[you]] from getting your hands on delicious cake and eating it. It is at times like these that [[Brenda Williams|one]] must go to extraordinary measures to get at that delicious cake you so crave.

Fortunately, the [[sick fuck|scientists]], [[aspie|mathematicians]], [[developers|engineers]], [[retard|physicists]] and [[drunk|metaphysicists]] at [[4chan]] are working around-the-clock posing every conceivable hypothetical situation one might find oneself in, vis-a-vis delicious cake, and the ultimate prize -enjoying said deliciousness.

==Delicious Cake Threads==
A '''Delicious Cake''' thread starts when the [[OP]] posits a potentially problematic situation involving delicious cake and you (with regards to your getting at and ultimately eating the delicious cake). The [[Terri Schiavo|brain trust]] at [[B|/b/]] then lets loose a barrage of posts with potential solutions to this horrible dilemma. This originated from the old Super Mario 64, where the final reward for weeks of wasted life was the [[Whore|Princess]] deciding to "make a Delicious Cake. For Mario!"

It is a little known fact, but all cake problems can be solved by maeking the problem divide by (the problem - you & cake), which results in just you and cake.

this is just like  (5x7)/5 = 7. problem/(problem - you and cake) = you and cake.  simple

The following is a neatly demonstrated example...

==Women and Cake==
[[Image:Girlwithcake.jpg|thumb|right|Look at this woman, practically begging for you to judge and eat her [[delicious cake]]. But [[you]] had to go fuck this up by giving them the vote, instead of putting locks on your [[kitchen]]]] 

Believe it or not, about [[100 years ago]], [[women]] by law, were expected to bake delicious cake for their men. And if said cake was anything short of fucking [[delicious cake|delicious]]... and I mean motherfucking [[sex|delicious]], it was common practice that she be told to return to the [[kitchen]] to bake at least a [[9000|dozen]] more 'till the man was satisfied. If said woman was insulting enough to bake no less then said [[at least 100|dozen]] cakes, [[buttsecks]] was required... no [[lube]].
