'''Zetaforum''' is one of the other major [[furfag]] and [[bestiality]] sites on the internet. For people that have not registered it may seem like a normal site. Once you register and go into one of selected threads you may notice this is worse than your typical furry forum. They have videos of people fucking any kind of animal, vaginally or anally. They treat animals like they were humans and even go so low as actually dating them. They even give you sexual tips on what type of animal is good for fucking and how you should fuck such animal. This gives [[camwhore]]s who love to fuck animals just what they need because they even have a request page for everyone to jack off to them having [[sex]] with animals.

==Website Down==
As of November 7th, 2010 [http://www.zetaforum.org/ Zetaforum] and all their related bestiality sites are currently down (something about Chris not paying his server bills, again!) but may resurface at any time....lets just hope it stays that way and they never comes back. 

Another theory may be that the police finally tracked down these sick fucks and sent them to prison.
