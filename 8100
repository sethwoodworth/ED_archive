Tethering
{{Stub}}

'''Tethering''' is the ability to connect your [[computer]] to the [[internet]] with your [[DERP|smartphone]] while running up your phone bill downloading pornography in the park.

<del>If you want to use [[IRC]] or any other port, you're out of luck unless you can tunnel through to another port because [[AT&T]] and [[Verizon]] don't want you using your [[CS III|leet skills]] to hack their network.  Never mind that [[FACT|the big phone companies want to find some excuse to abandon their POTS (Plain Old Telephone System)]] and all their old customers too [[retarded]] to operated a cell phone.</del> [[No_life|IRC]] and other things work fine with a tethered connection on [[AT&T]] and [[Verizon]].

== PDANet ==
One way to access the Interwebs using tethering is to use [http://www.junefabrics.com/ PDANet].  PDANet is available for [[iPhone]], [[Android]], [[Obama|Blackberry]], and [[masterbation|Palm]].  The free version allows you to access any HTTP website, but if you want to access HTTPS, you will have to [[pirate|pay]] for the full version of the software.

== WifiTether ==
The less [[fail|lame]] way of tethering is using a [[anal|rooted]] Android phone and installing WifiTether [http://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/downloads/list]. Some argue that this is "Jew" tethering, but since there's no such thing as a free lunch, you are in fact [[cancer|part of the problem]].  Remember to keep the phone as close as possible to your balls when using any tethering program.
