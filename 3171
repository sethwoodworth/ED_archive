'''g2g''', also spelled gtg, is a common [[acronym]] used when [[pregnant|pulling out]] of [[chat]]. Often meaning "got to go", Gtg is commonly used in tandem with a forward slash, followed by the reason why said individual is bailing out of the internet.

Examples:

'''g2g/sleep''' - [[g2g i need sleep|User needs sleep]].

'''g2g/boring''' - Chat sux.

'''g2g/fire''' - [[Something is on fire]].

'''g2g/mom''' - User is [[age of consent|underage b&]].

'''g2g/your mum''' - User THINKS he's being really funny.

'''g2g/girlfriend''' - User is a [[liar]].

'''g2g/KFC''' - User's name is Jerome, or possible [[Sheneequa]].

'''g2g/Chris Hansen''' - User is on [[To Catch a Predator]].

'''g2g/sabbath''' - User did [[WTC]].

'''g2g/GRIDS''' - [[User:Drunkenlazybastard|DLB]] has just claimed another victim.

g2g is also commonly used by white suburban teenagers who are trying a little too hard to be gangsta, and therefore lose the ability to articulate speech. If you encounter such a person, slap them.
