Sylvia Plath
'''Sylvia Plath''' was the writer responsible for popularizing confessional [[poetry]], in which the poet goes on for soppy pages about how dreary life is, and how all the puppies look sad, and how much she wants to stick her head in an oven. Eventually, she tired of writing about [[suicide]] and committed it, instead.

Her work is worshiped by [[emo]]s, [[goth]]s, [[cutter]]s and all [[16-year-old girl]]s and is loathed by twenty-somethings who have outgrown that phase.
