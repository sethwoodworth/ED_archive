'''''Limbo of the Lost''''', or "'''[[LOL]]'''" is a [[ripoff|totally original and innovative]] [[old|point and click adventure]] game. [[You]] play as Captain Benjamin Spooner Briggs to explore [[the internet|Limbo in the Keep of Lost Souls]]. Unlike real games, this is a giant pile of [[ripoff]], [[tracing]], printscreen, and [[fail]].

==Plot==
Captain Benjamin Spooner Briggs is [[schizophrenic|the captain of the ''Mary Celeste'', a ghost ship]]. Since this is an [[oxymoron]], [[Jesus|Destiny]] decides to use him as a hitman to take out [[Allah|Fate]] somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle.

In the early [[90s]], Creative/Project Director Steve Bovis and Tim Croucher came up with the [[shitty|brilliant]] concept for this [[game]]. They began work on it in 1995 with help from Laurence Francis and the original intent to make [[LOL]] for the [[Atari ST]]. It was later ported to the [[Amiga]] 1200 and CD32, but at that point it was [[shit nobody cares about]] anymore, so the publishers threw it down the well.

When the [[threesome]] realized they needed to tighten up the graphics, they taught themselves super high-tech tools like [[Poser]], [[Photoshop]], printscreen and an [[open source]] engine called [http://dead-code.org/home/ Wintermute]. They founded Majestic Studios and started making their very own 3D game. After realizing that [[computer science]] and [[art]] are hard, they decided that it would be easier to just <strike>steal</strike> take inspiration from other games and films.

{{quote|The project is more influenced by film and literature rather than other games, we want the experience to be as original as possible and as such we have made a calculated effort to keep away from other games in the genre. Limbo of the Lost is an experience first and foremost, secondly wrapped up in a game media and genre.|Steve Bovis}}

==Drama==

[[Image:Majestic_shitting_a_brick_over_spoilers.JPG|thumb|right|Steve shitting a [[brick]] over [[GameFAQs|GameFAGs]].]]

When Majestic Studios' publisher, Tri Synergy, found out that Steve and pals had been stealing, tracing and plagiarizing, they shat a [[brick]] and stopped distributing [[LOL]]. [[Fallout|Bethesda Softworks]] should pursue a [[lawsuit]] against Majestic Studios since [[LOL]] is the worst game ever, though that has yet to be seen. In the meantime, Steve's daughter has been lavishing praise on her dad's game by making [[sockpuppet]] posts all over the [[internet|hugglenets]].

The internet, however, has risen to the occasion and is enjoying the corruption of [[LOL]]. A "name the stolen asset" meta-game has become a large part of this endeavor.

==Sequel?==

{{quote|I could talk about this project for hours but I would prefer you to play, experience and enjoy it, so I will hush up for now. But before I say a fond farewell I will tell you this much, If anyone can honestly tell me after playing the game that they did not have an enjoyable gaming experience or have a favorite character that they have met whilst playing the game, I will never mention or speak of the sequel — LIMBO of the LOST II — Temptations of Tarot.|Steve Bovis}}

Good god, I hope not.

==Ending==
<s>If you haven't played the game then don't watch this video as it contains spoilers.</s> This is quite possibly the only redeeming feature of the entire game. If you have seen this ending as a result of actually COMPLETING this batshit game, then it's about time you became [[An Hero|an hero]]. Now.
