Sir Isaac Newton
Sir Isaac Newton was a [[England|British]] nobleman who legislated the Laws of Physics with an iron fist. Most people think that he developed mathematical formulae to explain physics that already existed, but this is not true. He invented modern physics as we know them. Also, it is a known fact that Newton Invented Apples, as well as oranges.

==Isaac Newton's Physics==
Isaac Newton re-wrote the laws of physics written by [[Boxxy]] [[at least 100 years ago]] so he could explain them. Her laws of physics were a [[Microsoft|DOS]] application written in C. Isaac Newton realized that DOS was too unstable and bugged to run physics [[software]] for the [[america|entire world]], so he re-wrote the programs for [[Linux]], improving them along the way.

However, the transition was not as smooth as expected. Although the Laws of Physics were now more predictable, ran smoother, used less system resources, were immune to hacking and viruses, and never crashed, it was incompatible with [[old]] concepts such as Leonardo di Vinci's flying machines and [[magic]]. It also removed the Gravity Gun. In sheer [[irony]], poor Isaac Newton's creation took away the power he used to create it. HAHA [[PWNED]].

He most recently made a game with all of his God-Like knowlege of physics and coded in 'lua' into what he calls the "Source Engine". If you have not heard of Half-Life 2 or any of his other masterpieces, you can go die.

More recently, as Newton's Laws of Physics were open source, they were replaced with edits from leet physics [[hacker|h4xx0rz]] like [[Einstein]], Planck and Hawking. These 31337 d00dz were totally obsessed with small things. To whit, proving that they indeed DID have sexual organs. No! Really, we just like physics. It doesn't make us strange. We're still men. Aren't we?<br>
Recently, they have been quite successful. [[Stephen Hawking]] has grandchildren, but it's best not to think about that.
