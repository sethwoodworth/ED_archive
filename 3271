Gendo Pose
The '''Gendo Pose''' (aka '''Evil Ambassador Pose''') is a [[meme]] from ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''. Gendo(u) Ikari is a [[Batshit insane]] scientist and leader of the Nerv and its projects. He once had a normal relationship with his wife Yui and his son Shinji, but then his wife turned into goo and merges with a biological [[mecha|mech]] and Gendo [[GTFO|kicks]] Shinji out of the house. This causes Shinji to become a whiny [[emo]] bitch, and Gendo's attempts to bring back his wife result in the blue-haired [[Rei]] instead.

Throughout the series, Gendo uses a trademark pose whenever he's speaking, thinking, or simply waiting. The pose involves hands clasped together and covering the mouth plus the bonus of shiny glasses. The hands and glasses (and sometimes eyebrows) are often shopped onto photos.
