[[Lie|'''Kurdistan''']] (Kurdspeak: كوردستان, [[Arab|Sandpeoplespeak]]: كردستان, [[Moonspeak]]: Քուրդիստան, [[Russia|Motherlandspeak]]: Курдистан) is a fictional country in west [[Asia]], despite having Islam as official religion they're america's [[bff]], who love terrorism and oil thus can be used for generating epic drama in middle east. Fap to their [[Iranian]] [[Aryan]] background, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DinmNkAeVHs here]. Kurdistan borders to several tragic countries, including [[Iran]], [[Iraq]] and [[Turkey]], which also is the reason Kurds are [[butthurt]] all the time. Kurds are butthurt about having no land, yet do not realize they are 100% sandnigger Iranians who speak an Indo-Iranian language, share Iranian genetics and come from an Iranian tribe (the Medes). Some may argue that Kurds got no [[friend]]s, which probably is mostly true, but lately they have formed alliances with other butthurt people, including [[Iraq]], [[Korea]] and [[Taiwan]]

== Kurdish Language ==
Kurds claim they have their own language, however, IRL, they keep switching between arabic, turkish and teh "kurdish language" (which has only a few original words of its own). Statistics say none of the kurds have achieved communicating with another kurd so far. Kurdish language has been an interesting subject for liguists since centuries ago due to its being mysterious and everything's being ambiguous in the language.

=== Iraqi Kurdistan ===
The [[Amerikkka]] loving part of Kurdistan, no terrorists over here, ''[[sarcasm|not at all]]''.

=== Turkish Kurdistan (Fictive) ===
Turkish Kurdistan, also bad Kurdistan. Unlike the Iraqi kurds, these Kurds are often being raped by [[America]], this always results in serious butthurt and several Turks being killed. This is also the only part where you will find [[terrorists]], ''[[ya rly]]''.
Kurds sell their families to the [[Communism|PKK]] and bomb children. Now, [[Turkey|somebody]] should [[Nuke|explain them]] that [[Fact|bombing children is only good for the lulz]].
In a better way of speaking, they are Turkey's niggers, which is already run by niggers of [[Europe]], therefore making Kurds Europe's [[Double Nigger]]s.

=== 4chan Kurdistan ===
A healthy Kurdish state exists somewhere between the [[b/|/b/]] and [[n/|/n/]] boards on [[4chan]]. If one thread mentioning Turkey comes up, [[at least 100]] Kurds will mention "z0mg kurdistan". Some argue that these aren't actually Kurds, just [[Stormfront|stormfags]] looking for an excuse to hate durkas. However, the practical differences between the stormfags and the Kurdish nationalists are yet to be determined.

== Kurds ==
Kurds are probably one of the few of Islamic nations who don't hate America and Israel (as Israel sells weapons to Kurdish guerrillas so they could continue fighting for the independence, [[lulz|which would never happen]]). Kurds and Peter Pan have a lot in common, in that both live in [[Second_life|the land of nowhere]]. If the States provide them with Kurdistan, they will find that the Kurds have nothing more to live for and that they will disappear into wisps of smoke to join [[Saddam Hussein]] and the [[Sparta]]n army to dine in [[hell]]. Others claim they are an artificial [[Aryan]] master race created by [[Stormfront]] to rid the [[Middle East]] of Negroid-interbreeding [[Semite]]s and the mongrel race of Turks before their foothold into Europe could do any more damage. However, considering the millions of Turks already infecting Europe with their cigarette and kebab odours, the experiment is seen as an enormous [[fail]]ure. Saddam was called in to destroy any evidence of the Kurds by [[pwning|gassing them to shit]], but being an inbred sandnigger, failed miserably. In [[2006]], he was executed by his masters for not carrying out his orders.

== Kurdish transportation ==
[[Image:SaddamwithSword.jpg|thumb|Another Kurdish pastime was to accuse Saddam of slicing and dicing them. Persistent claims by Saddam that it was done for the lulz did not suffice.]]
Transportation usually relies on either American [[military]] convoys or local camel rides. The scarce magic carpet stolen from the nearest Arab village is also frequent in use. If this is all unavailable they will call upon Sindbad and his crew to rise from the bottom of the sea and take them across any body of water. Sindbad, nor any Arab, nor anyone in the Middle East, or for that matter the whole world except for [[W]] in America likes the Kurds. Though if they would give him their checks from the American government and dance the Ali Baba while balancing a camel on their right shoulder, he will give them safe passage across the Seven Seas.

== Kurdish Economy ==
Major exports consist of deep fried [[camel spider]]s on a hot bun, Baba Dizayee's chicken blood rice,  Turkish hides and whining about being like Jews were [[at least 100 years ago]] all persecuted without a country and shit.

== "Kurds don't exist" ==
A popular theory is that Kurds actually [[Imaginary girlfriend|don't exist]]. They were invented [[Before the Internets|somewhere around 1950]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] to kill other races. Kurds claim to have [[At least 100 years ago|5000 thousands]] ([[sic]]) of years of [[history]] [[Dragon|while not having a single archaeological discovery based on their culture]]. This makes some people think [[Invisible|they actually don't exist]]. Another theory claims that the Kurds didn't see themselves primarily as Kurds until somewhere around 1920. Very convenient, as everyone was [[Gang rape|carving out pieces]] from [[Loser|The Ottoman Empire]] back then and [[Multiculturalism|nationalism]] had replaced [[religion]] as [[Liberal_guilt|the main principles on how to make rational decisions]] (Turkey itself being a [[Jailbait|prime]] example of an ill thought out nation that makes no sense in existing). And the most interesting fact about their so-called unity is that the Kurds hasn't gotten their heads out their asses long enough to make the decision about [[Leet|a common written language]], something that [[China|the chinks]] made long ago. Kurdish groups have so many different cultures and languages and dialects and even multiple ways of writing Kurdish ([[Arabic]], [[Cyrillic Millions Sign|Cyrillic]], [[Latin]] and in the past [[Armenians|Armenian]] alphabets) that it is impossible for them to unite in the sense of a nation-state. Just look at [[Israel]] - [[Jews]] flooded in from the smelliest depths of the world, speaking different languages, and Hamas says they [[Fact|still don't exist]].

== Trolling Kurds ==
# Tell them they don't exist. Argue about their non-existence.
# Tell the the Kurdish language does not exist and it's a mixture of many.
# Tell them that Kurd is not an actual race and that it's a mixture of many.
# Remind them that Kurds have never invented anything.
# Tell them they are brown skinned A-rabs (which they are).
# Call them "Mountain Niggers".
# Censor the word "Kurd" as if it is a swearword. (eg. k*rd) It Works!!
# Use the word kurd ''as'' a swearword.
# Say anything positive about Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.
# Remind them being a unique race doesn't entitle them to creating a new nation state.
# Tell them they are Terrorists.
# Tell them they are not recognized as a group in Turkey.
# Tell them they are disliked by Turkey, Iran and Iraq at the same time.
