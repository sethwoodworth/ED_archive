How does a /b/tard know what frosted butts is? ¯\(σ_ο)/¯

==The Meaning Behind "Frosted Butts"==

Scholars are currently in deep debate as to the sociopolitical and religious meanings associated with Frosted Butts. While some claim it is a message from some greater power, most believe it is some upcoming [[CapnOAwesome|cereal brand]]. Regardless, rampant speculation continues as we see both an increase in Frosted Butts sightings as well as a decrease in national math aptitudes. Some go so far as to suggest that in the future, the SAT and ACT will cease to feature a "Mathematics" section of their tests, instead requiring test-takers to demonstrate their knowledge of Frosted Butts. On the day that Frosted Butts becomes as widely-known and loved as [[The cancer that is killing /b/|Reese's Peanut Butter Puffs]], we will know that it is the end-times.

==The Truth Behind the Mystery==

Actually, [[newfags|faggots]] are apparently too busy touching their [[vagina|dicks]] to realize Frosted Butts originally came from the 90's Cartoon Network show ''Cow and Chicken''. Ironically, only [[babies|faggots]] watched ''Cow and Chicken'', thus once again proving that everyone on the planet is [[butthurt|a homo]].

==The Falsehood Behind the Truth Behind the Mystery==

According to [[your mom|a reputable source]], ''Cow & Chicken'' showcased not ''Frosted Butts'', but ''Sugar Frosted Weenies''. Clearly, those are not the same thing, ergo [[OP is a fag]].

==Who Really Gives a Shit, Though?==

Apparently these idiots [http://community.livejournal.com/4chan/1393702.html?view=21053478#t21053478 care], but in the end, no one of importance cares what Frosted Butts is or are. This is just another crazy Internet fad/meme that will be misquoted in a week, remembered only in passing in a month, and forgotten by the time you finish this sentence. Regardless, it's just as good as a combo breaker, and more funny. Lulz are emitted when a Frosted Butt is posted, so [[lurk moar|poast moar]]!
