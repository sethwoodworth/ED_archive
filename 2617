Electric Boogaloo

'''Electric Boogaloo''' is a term used on the [[internets]] to describe an egregious sequel that never should have been made. It all started in [[1984]] when the movie ''Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo'' was released and immediately proclaimed a shitty and completely unnecessary sequel to a movie that was released only seven months prior, and wasn't any good to begin with.

The term is [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1169126,00.html most commonly used] to describe those unbearably shitty movie sequels that make you wish it were possible to kick a movie in the balls (See ''[[The Matrix]]''). Unfortunately, books fall victim to this plague just as often (See [http://www.rsimpson.id.au/books/tomorrow/ ''Tomorrow, When The War Began'']).

A similar meme for those who want variety is to instead tack "The Quickening" (from the shitty movie ''Highlander II: The Quickening'') after the title (e.g. ''Supernova II: The Quickening'').
