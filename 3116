[[File:Sane_clown_posse.png|thumb|250px|left|The Sane Clown Posse knows how Fuckin Magnets work]]
Sure, everyone knows that [[juggalo]]s are some of the ugliest, dumbest, least socially-adjusted people in the world. But who would have thought that the [[Insane Clown Posse]] [[duh|was as dumb as the fans they make money off of]]? On April 6, [[2010]], ICP would release their most watched music video; '''Miracles''' (or '''Fuckin' Magnets''' as it's properly called), teaching all of us that you're never too old to inform the world of your [[retard]]ation and painfully reminding America of the nation's failing Public School system.

[[File:Jaggalos-ED_was_right.png|thumb|[[Juggalos|trufax]].]]
[[File:Hello.jpg|thumb|What Shaggy was talking about when he said "I seen shit that'll shock ya eyelids"]]

When [[wigger]]s decide to spout their stupidity is when the world begins to mourn for what once was a [[wigger]]-free world. "Fucking Magnets" became a somewhat amusing meme thanks to the absolute stupidity of the Insane Clown Posse and their inability to understand anything but dead bodies and hatchets. If either of the two [[faggot]]s could stop blowing each other long enough to listen to a scientist they might figure out how magnets work. But alas, scientists be gettin' them pissed with their awe-inspiring inability to understand the differences between fact, law, and theory.

Other idiots have espoused their bullshit stupidity and clearly not learned an important lesson. That is, [[truth|not to open one's trap and show how much of a dumbass you are]] when you're already cruising on the shattered hopes of 13,000 douchebags in clown makeup screaming about hatchets. The unfortunate part of the whole charade is there are idiots that look up to them and kinged them the Lord Retards of the inability to understand simple science Carnival.

|They are trying to get across the wonder of the world. How there are explanations,﻿ but its all still so amazing. Obviously you take these things for granted. Because once you look past the science, or even looking at the science, it is magic. That's what science is. And that's what our world is. So, please let people have their own opinions, and leave you close minded racket out of it. If you don't like the song, leave it alone and don't listen to it. Its fairly simple.| Yes, it's obviously deep philosophy. I know Plato himself often put on clown makeup. [http://www.youtube.com/user/hleighp hleighp] 
|Also, the true meaning of a song, the heartfelt time that﻿ is put into it, the beauty of being able to create something that profound and ancient isn't something you can hold in your hand. Vinyl, CDs, and iPods are merely things you use to listen to the music. Sound is not something you can hold. And the man that doesn't need miracles is blind. Life being lived is a miracle.

'''ICP's Response...'''

<center>{{morphquote|fuckinmagnets2|fuckinmagnets2|

|I don’t know what Webster’s definition of the word “miracle” is, but we’ve always thought it meant something fuckin’ amazing and incredible. A fuckin’ special, awesome event of some kind. A great, wonderful thing. A fuckin’ miracle.| I believe a consultation of Webster's is necessary

|The song “Miracles” is classic ICP. Our listeners know we’ve always included one or two deep, meaningful songs on our albums, we’ve just never made a video for one until now. It was a good idea, obviously, ‘cause it’s got people talkin’. The truth is it don’t make us mad to see all the hate “Miracles” gets from the mainstream. We’ve been “The Most Hated Band in The World” for many years. Without all the hate on the outside, it wouldn’t be as warm as it is on the inside with the Juggalo Fam. Instead, all the hate “Miracles” generates makes us sad. Sad for the haters.| I know they make ME sad.

|I mean, yeah, we get it. It’s funny to people on the outside lookin’ in, seeing two clowns rapping about space and shit, while floatin’ around in an orgy of screen savers. And SNL’s parody was off the hook hilarious. But when you step back and really look at all the genuine hate it got from everyday people, it’s hard to believe that so few got it.| Got what? A brain haemorrhage? 

|Yes, most of the miracles we mention can easily be explained away by science, that’s why we say the line “fuck scientists.” Their factual findings sometimes explain away the Earth’s cool mysteries. Part of me wishes they were lying. Part of me doesn't want to know how they really make crop circles. My imagination wants to believe it’s aliens or somethin’. If people can’t relate to that, then that’s their loss. I mean, seriously, it must truly suck to have no imagination about these things. Us Juggalos have deep imaginations, and an awesome sense of humor.| Every single one of their videos is a bunch of circus queens rapping about staggeringly stupid shit. How imaginative.

|As for the infamous line, “fuckin’ magnets… how do they work?” Magnets were like magic to me as a kid. You could move things across the table without actually touching them! I found that shit amazing and I still do. If you don’t like that, have a dick for dinner. As for the sun and the stars. Who looks up into the sky and doesn't wonder sometimes? Come on, man, I fuckin’ straight up feel sorry for anybody that can look at the moon the trees, and the seven seas, and not see fuckin’ miracles. It’s not about religion either. Nature itself is a miracle. Stand toe to toe with the ocean at night and tell me that shit ain’t amazing.| Yes, the song was clearly a philosophical statement.

|We appreciate all this shit. Especially a yellow ass, long neck giraffe. What’s a shame is how people walk around blind to it all. They lost their spirit about everything. If you can’t even see the miracle in animals, then you must have never truly loved a pet. That has to suck for you. Maybe you mother fuckers should relax that wound up, extra tense bitch ass of yours for a minute and go smoke a joint or somethin’.| They love Asian asses?

|Be an individual, step out and away from the flow of the crowd. Take a time out, open up ya mind and then peep the giraffe. Try to appreciate some of these miracles, bitch.| It's a miracle he can withstand the mental strain of having to blink every few seconds.

|What’s a miracle is the fact that some people haven’t recognized by now that Insane Clown Posse will never die. ICP will go down in history as an independent music miracle. Get used to these ugly faces. MMFCLJ.| Delusions of mediocrity.

|P.S. -
We feel like these haters are the big dumb, popular jocks ganging up on the little class clown scrub. When they have no idea the scrub is really a highly skilled, deadly, ninja assassin capable of cleaning their fuckin’ clocks.|

Before the the video was released, here it was Violent had to [http://www.insaneclownposse.com/music/violent-js-personal-review-of-bang-pow-boom/ say] about the song. After the huge buzz the song created online, Violent J issued a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UvhMAMQbI second response] on Detroit's 96.5 Buzz radio show. Shortly after, Violent J [http://psychopathicrecords.com/hatchetherald/100423/index.html responded] via ICP's weekly "Hatchet Herald" e-Letter, stating he feels bullied.
