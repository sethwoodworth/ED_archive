''Another'' wiki parody, but this time it is even less funny than Uncyclopedia due to the simple fact that it is run by [[German]]ic [[Nazi]]. The one funny thing about this wiki is that '''everything is in fucking GERMAN!''' I mean, [[lol|LOLOLOLOL]] I CAN'T SPEAK YOUR FUCKING MOON LANGUAGE but it is still heil-arious!

You know how [[Uncyclopedia]] has the ever-so-fresh, not-at-all-old Oscar Wilde quote in every article and how [[Encyclopedia of Stupid]] starts every article with <nowiki>{{PAGENAME}}</nowiki> is stupid? Yeah, these guys talk about fucking CAMELS.
