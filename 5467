Monkids

'''As the tropical jungles of the world''' are being destroyed by farmers and [[BP|oil companies]], what will happen to all the animals? No need to worry - thousands of [[Americunts|Americans]] have come to the rescue by "adopting" baby monkeys [[New Jersey|born in the USA]]. These [[W|little apes]] known as '''Monkids''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''"monkey"'' and ''"kid"'') are produced in factory-farm conditions, mostly in [[Florida]] and other janky-ass states, brutally ripped away from their mothers when three days old, and sold for [[over 9,000|$10,000]] to "empty-nest" middle-aged ladies as well as to families with young children who think that having a violent, criminally insane beast leaping around and biting everyone's faces would be super fun. The monkeys, which they call "monkids," are forced to live like [[FCYTravis|human infants]] for a few months or years until their natural insane viciousness becomes too much and the "parents" have to off-load them to other retards who couldn't afford to buy a brand-new fresh baby monkey, and need to get a used one.

==Who buys them?==
[[File:Monkey Children.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Women]] usually buy these things, as is evident by the look of misery her husband shares with the monkeys.]]
===Eco-retards===
Predictably, the retards are all pretty sure that they are doing their part to make the world a better place by [[bestiality|attempting to humanize]] their monkids, and even [[jews|buying & selling]] them, the same way they keep their cats and dogs healthy by feeding them [[vegetarian]] diets. However, their logic is more faulty than even [[Sea Kittens]] logic. The main reason for eco-retards to buy monkids is that zoos are simply overflowing with baby monkeys, despite the fact their species are going extinct.

{{tinyquote|The exotic animals in the United States need your help because if the public doesn't do its part in caring for the exotic animals in the United States, who will?  The breeders, refuges, sanctuaries, zoos and private owners need your help because they can't take care of all of their surplus baby animals, juveniles and even adults.  If they did, they would be over populated in the sense that they don't have enough land or room on their property to keep them or maybe they just can't afford to feed another mouth.  They might need room for a new exhibit or they might have to sell some animals cheap to stay in business.  In these cases, they have to find people to buy or to give them away.  That can be you!   You might think that they should have their animals fixed so they can't have babies.  If they did that, we would have no more exotic animals in the United States.  So that's not happening. What I would like to see is more people breeding wild native and exotic animals.  That way, they have a better chance to survive and not become extinct. This is especially important for endangered species.|[http://www.monkeybreeder.com/help.html Randy Davies], retard and animal trafficker}}

The truth is, though, that any talk of ecology, concern for our vanishing wildlife, etc. etc. is merely an excuse to rationalize and justify these idiots' [[fetish|bizarre desire]] for an oh-so-darling little monkid.

Most of the women who buy monkids are either middle-aged and [[childfree|childless]] or twenty-something [[breeders]] with an insatiable desire to endlessly change shitty diapers. Monkids are the perfect choice for these women as they are the perfect combinations of [[Kevin Havens|dolls]] and cats, something which is both fluffy and they can dress up.

The theory is that harvesting a newborn infant monkey away from its dear loving mother will help it to "bond" with its new "mom," so that she and her monkid can live happily ever after until one of them dies of old age. The reality is what any reasonable person could have told them, and probably did tell them. The traumatized young monkey, not having its own instinct for suicide, will make human life a living hell and will probably kill or maim someone unless the people stuff it into a suitcase where it belongs and throw it off a bridge.

==Controversy==
===Advantages of owning a monkid===
Of course, it may be cruel, but that doesn't mean it's illegal. There are actually some ways that having a monkid around the house could make your life a whole lot more chill. It wouldn't be too bad to have a slave to run and fetch you things from the refrigerator, while you kick back and watch TV. It is even possible to outfit the simian with a little battery-bowered belt, with which you could administer a mild electric shock by remote control, if the monkey begins to slack off or fetches you the wrong item. Later, just lock it in its cage with a banana and some dog kibble, and your work is done.

One restaurant owner realized that putting his pet monkeys to work could make tons of money for him. As a bonus, since the owner is a [[Japan|Jap]], he can eat the monkey when it grows too old to work.

===Disadvantages of owning a monkid===
[[File:Monkeykisses.com2.png|thumb|CUTE! I WANT SOME!]]
Like their [[niggers|larger descendants]] most monkids will eventually turn on their owners once they reach sexual maturity, which comes much sooner than in humans. Many a 5-year old girl in a monkid-owning family has awakened to an unexpected session of monkey [[bukkake]].

Another disadvantage of owning a monkid (particularly for women) is that unlike dolls, when changing their diapers and scrapping off the shit they flung onto the walls gets boring there is little they can do about it. Monkids can be placed in cages, preferably in total darkness, but they tend to make a lot of noise and break easily. Some lucky owners will however do not have aggressive monkeys but insted find them with their own tails wrapped around their necks.

==(In)-Famous Cases==
===[[Madonna]]===
Monkids are also highly popular among celebrities, most notably in [[2006]] when [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6039380.stm Madonna adopted a child from Africa]. As with all cases of monkid adoptions the public were initially concerned that it should remain in the [[Africa|wild]] with it's father. There was also the issue of whether like Travis the chimp (see below) her monkid would become dangerous when it grows up, as many of their adults are.

Despite this, following her example many other celebrities have decided to adopt black babies - such as Sandra Bullock and Angelina Jolie.

===Travis the Killer Chimp===
{{main|Travis}}
[[File:Chimp-victim.png|thumb|300px|left|WHEN MONKIDS ATTACK]]{{clear}}
In 2009 a [[Psychiatrists|psychotic]] diaper-wearing chimpanzee with a history of violence called Travis (a.k.a. "Furious George) re-created the scene from his favorite movie "Face/Off" by inexplicably attacking his owner's friend. During the media sensation, which followed, many people asked if it was right for people to adopt wild animals and treat them like hairy toddlers. 

Most monkid owners secretly agreed that it was dangerous, having experienced the bizarre tantrums of their own monkids. The knew they had really made mistakes in buying their monkids, but were too embarrassed to admit it. The more clever of the retards began to place ads to get rid of the monkids.
