The '''North American Union''' is the union of the governmental and economic systems of North America currently planned by a secret [[Liberal]]/[[neocon|Neo-Con]]/[[Zionist]] conspiracy. By 2010, the peoples of [[Mexico]], [[Canada]], and [[The United States]] will be ruled by a [[W|single power]] that will do away with the American borders and US sovereignty, along with the Constitution, The Bill of Rights, [[Freedom]], [[Democracy]], etc...

Many [[politics|politicians]] and [[media]] people have stated that the idea of the North American Union is a "boogeyman" for [[conspiracy]] nuts. THESE PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY TRAITORS AND PART OF THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT

== Background ==
[[Image:GirlWithFlag.jpg|thumb|By the time this girl is old enough to vote, she will be considered a citizen of Uni√≥n Norteamericano. Won't someone think of the [[children]]?]]

The United States of America has survived a [[Civil War]], a [[poor|Great Depression]], two [[holocaust|World Wars]], a [[The Cold War|Cold War]] with [[Communism]], and history's worst [[Jews did WTC|terrorist attack]]. But it is about to be DESTROYED FROM THE INSIDE BY AN EVIL CONSPIRACY. In March 2005 at a summit at [[Waco]], [[Texas]], [[George W Bush]], Vincente Fox, and the Canadian guy announced the formation of the "Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America."[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=15233] This agreement forms the backbone of the shadow government that will eventually rule the NAU. [[Some argue|It is also believed]] that The Trilateral Commission and The Council on Foreign Relations is involved. As well as the [[Illuminati]], the [[Freemasons]], Skull and Bones, and of course, [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion|The Elders of Zion]]. They have held their business in [[Esperanto]] so only 3 outsiders are even capable of understanding the documents if they had the chance to see their plans.

== How Do I Made North American Union? ==

The elitist shadow government has already planned several steps that will lead to an inevitable formation of the North American Union. All of these steps are being carried out in secret and without the permission of the peoples Mexico, Canada, and the US. 

These steps include:
#Neglect the US borders and allow an invasion of [[Mexicans|illegal immigrants]]. ([[OMFG]]! ALREADY COMPLETE!!!111)
#Build a "NAFTA Superhighway" that will connect Mexico to Canada.
#Force all of North America to use "The Amero".
#????
#[[profit|TYRANNY!!!Mixed with corporate]]

=== The NAFTA Superhighway ===
[[Image:Naftasuperhighway.jpg|thumb|This is what the NAFTA Superhighway will look like when completed.]]

The NAFTA Superhighway is a MAJOR EARLY STEP IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES. It will be [[at least 100|at least 400]] yards wide and will stretch from the ports on Mexico's west coast, all the way through the American heartland, and into Canada. The Superhighway will be flanked by freight and rail lines, [[oil]] pipelines, and [[tubes|fiber optic cables]]. It's construction will displace at [[at least 100|least A MILLION]] households, and it is being built secretly, '''right under our noses.'''[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=15497]

The Superhighway will be used to transport freight from [[China]] into the United States. [[shit|Chinese imports]] will be received at Mexican sea ports where they will be inspected by Mexican Customs Agents who are low-paid and CARE NOTHING ABOUT AMERICAN SECURITY. The Superhighway will allow [[terrorists]] and [[drug|drug-dealers]] to move freely to the north of the border, and [[job|jobs]] will be shipped to the south.

The [[elitist]] conspiracy is doing everything in its power to silence those in the Media and prevent the [[Americunts|American people]] knowing the [[truth|TRUTH]]. Only one presidential candidate, the Paladin of Patriotism, [[Ron Paul]] has dared to SPEAK OUT against the shadow government and has tried to stop this EVIL HIGHWAY from being built.

=== The Amero ===
[[Image:Amero_note.jpg|thumb|A possible design for the paper Amero]]
[[Image:AmeroCoin.jpg|thumb|The 20 Amero coin. Note that Lady Liberty (played by tennis phenom Maria Sharapova) is seated next to a fasces. Yeah, that's right, THE SYMBOL OF [[Fascism|FASCISM!]]]]

Another major step towards a North American Union is a single currency. The American Dollar, the Mexican Peso, and whatever the Canadians use will be replaced with the Amero, a single monetary unit for the entire continent. When this happens, YOUR LIFE'S SAVINGS IN AMERICAN DOLLARS WILL BE WORTHLESS. Only those who have converted their savings into real Jew[[gold]] bullion will be safe.

[[They]] are ALREADY MAKING AMEROS! The conspiracy denies that the Amero exists. They even went so far as to close the Denver Mint to the public while they made them. But the great patriot and defender of the [[whites|white race]], [[Hal Turner]] exposed this [[lie]] by obtaining a real Amero coin smuggled out of the Mint by one of his many [[fags|allies]].

=== North American Union Driver's Licenses? ===
[[Image:NorthAmericanUnionDriversLicense.jpg|thumb|Left: The North Carolina driver's license. Right: a logo of the shadow government. Coincidence? I DON'T THINK SO.]]

There are reports that the US state of [[North Carolina]] has ALREADY BEGUN to issue "Union" driver's licenses. [http://wnd.com WorldNetDaily] has discovered that new NC Driver's License ID cards feature a new security hologram on the back. [http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=57502]

{{quote|The hologram looks exactly [like] the map of North America that is used as the background for the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America logo on the SPP website," Gheen told WND. "I object to the loss of sovereignty that is proceeding under the agreements being made by these unelected government bureaucrats who think we should be North American instead of the United States of America.|WorldNetDaily}}

=== The Conspiracy of Silence ===

THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT HAS BOUGHT THE SILENCE OF THE MEDIA. Only one major media personality, CNN's Lou Dobbs refuses to be silent. Like a great shining [[attention whore|white knight]], Dobbs has risen up in defense of the [[white trash|working]] man and has spoken out against the [[Mexicans|Brown Peril]].

Of course, [[Wikipedia]] is part of the conspiracy. They REFUSE TO ALLOW ANYONE TO WRITE AN ARTICLE ON THE NORTH AMERICAN UNION.

{{quote|I believe this is the first time I have used Wikipedia fruitlessly. Just because the mass media of the world is failing to educate the populace on this topic, I still hold faith that this "free" source is not unduly influenced in its presentation of the facts. But, if this is indeed the case, then I fear that The American Constitution, or entries like "Lysander Spooner" may someday cease to be accessible in any factual form. And no, i don't feel like I'm over-reacting. Everyone should be wary of a website this powerful. Corruption is like a vulture, hovering patiently.|Wikipedia truth-seeker[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Independent_Task_Force_on_North_America]}}

Though Wikipedia is SILENT, the [[conservative|true Patriots]] at [[Conservapedia]] are all over it.[http://www.conservapedia.com/North_American_Union] They point to this as a proof of bias in Wikipedia.[http://www.conservapedia.com/Examples_of_Bias_in_Wikipedia]

== What Can I Do? ==

You can fight the conspiracy by creating "[[drama]]." That's right: you don't even have to get your fat, lazy ass up out of your computer chair to be part of the revolution. 

Go to other peoples [[forums]], [[blogs]], and [[wiki]]s to [[spam]] the FUCK out of them with the TRUTH about the NAU. Use the "drama" as gauge to know whom to trust. If someone calls you names like "[[Libertarian|conspiracy freak]]," "[[Republican|wingnut]]," "[[Democrat|extremist]]," "[[Hippy|zealot]]" or "[[fucktard]]," then you know that they are with the conspiracy and that you should be wary of them. DON'T WORRY. When the [[Anarchy|revolution]] comes, they will be exposed for their treason and will be [[Raped|dealt with]] accordingly.
