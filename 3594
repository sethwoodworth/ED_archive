Halp is what [[n00bs]] beg for whenever their [[tubes]] get clogged. Halp is divided into three categories:

== Valid Halp ==

This halp is usually a few sentences that actually answer a valid question. These questions range from "how do i poast a pix?" to "I can't get the movieclip instance to load properly, and the hitTest isn't showing up. What's wrong?"

== Faggot Halp ==

This halp is an answer to some sort of [[faggoty]] question, like, [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|When did Sasuke kill Naruto?"]].

== Lulzy Halp ==

'''[[Noob]]:''' halp, I installed [[Windows Optimizer]] and nao my omputarc isnt working rite<br>
'''[[Troll]]:''' Deleting [[System32]] will solve all your problems. Good luck, bro. [[YHBT|You definitely haven't been trolled.]]
