Black Metal
{{tl;dr}}


[[Image:Morecbsy.jpg|thumb|1000px|center|[[Nazi|Varg]] thinks you fags should burn more churches]]

Despite the name, '''black metal''' is not [[heavy metal]] music made by [[niggers]]. Black metal is instead an offshoot of [[heavy metal]] developed in Norway by [[Satan]]ist [[faggoth]]s who decided that death metal wasn't [[gay]] enough. Proving just what lemmings they are, this [[faggotry|music]] has recently become immensely popular among [[13-year-old boy]]s on [[the internets]]. Despite this, Black metal was never popular even during the genre's heyday, due to the emphasis on "kvlt", which the artists define as "doing it for the music and not the money", but what everyone else defines as "[[trufax|not going to make any money anyway]]".

== How to become tr00 kvlt ==
[[Image: Kvlt.jpg|thumb||250px|right|[[Protip]]: In black metal, it doesn't matter what the fuck you wear so long as it's ''black''! You get it now?]]
To be tr00 kvlt you must look the part, act the part, have virginity firmly intact, [[No Life|a band, a side-project, a solo-project, and around thirty or so other groups that you occasionally do work for as a session musician]]. This [[halp|helpful]] guide will give you some insights how.

===Learn to black metal===

To be tr00 kvlt you [[fact|don't actually have to listen to black metal]]. If you can screech in a high-pitched rasp into your computer's microphone you've already won half the battle. No need to deal with boring shit like talent, tonality, or actually being able to play a musical instrument. Just simulate guitar and drums by recording static and clicking the top of a pen near the mic respectively. Remember, there is artistic merit to [[bullshit|noise and atonality]], but for additional kvlt points you must never, under any circumstances, be familiar with any of the reasons why this is true and understand absolutely none of the theory behind it. 90% of the black metal musician's (read: [http://www.google.com/search?sclient=psy&hl=en&q=define%3A+misnomer&aq=f&aqi=g5&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1 misnomer]) job during an interview is to be able to pull pseudo-philosophical bullshit out of your ass. The remaining 10% will either be used for causing drama with other bands or talking shit about how [[Christfag|Christian black metal]] and [[newfags]] are ruining the [[shit|movement]].

However, there are a few things you really need to keep in mind to be a [[moar]] tr00 kvlt [[pun|vo'killist]]. When recording your vocals you should remember that death metal is the genre of men sounding like the cookie monster choking on [[semen]]; whereas black metal is [[lie|diverse and varied]] enough that your vocals may either sound like ''[[Wicca|The Wicked Witch of the West]]'' or ''[[Power Rangers|Rita Repulsa]]'' choking on semen. If you must cut your balls off and become a [[whore|woman]] to do this, so be it.

Remember, black metal is only partially about the music and acting like an [[elitist musical bastards|elitist musical bastard]]. To be [[redundant|truly tr00 kvlt]] you must also dress the part! The typical trailer-trash clothes of regular metal were thrown out in favor of [[fag|bondage]] gear, [[faggoth]] face paint, and lots of [[cock|spikes]]...hard, juicy, comforting <s>phallic symbols</s> spikes. Well [[over 9000]] articles of black metal clothing can be found at [[Hot Topic]], although black metal [[fags|musicians]] will never admit it. Bonus points abound if you make this shit yourself using a regular black arm warmer and rusted nails that your dad said you could use.

===Moar black metal fashun tips!===
[[Image: Kvltmahboiiii.jpg|thumb|[[LINK MAH BOIIIII|Euronymous mah booiiiii, this is what all tr00 black metallers strive for.]]]]
* Watch ''The Crow''.

* Masturbate over how many [[13 year old boys|girls]] this will get you.

* Now that you're satisfied begin the next phase. Grow your hair long, never fucking wash it or else you're a Christian.

* This is a long process; you may want to either purchase a wig, wear a hat, or comb it over your fucking face like the emo pussy you are.

* <s>Buy steel toed boots and spikes at [[Hot Topic]]</s> Make gauntlets yourself out of construction paper and thumbtacks, [[cunt|pussy]]! Also, boots are too heavy and will tear the atrophied muscles buried under the pounds of cankle fat that most [[fucktards]] who listen to black metal will have built up -- wear black tennis shoes or crocs instead.

* Along with the boots and spikes, wear shitty black jeans and a random band shirt. Bonus points if the t-shirt isn't actually from a metal band.

After you have completed this you may go find moar interracial [[porn]] to aid in fapping, you are now at last tr00 kvlt!

===Additional band help===
[[File:BlackMetalSuicide.jpg|thumb|200x|right|[[Suicide]]: It Sells!]]

Those of you who are truly [[retarded]] may need help to make a [[impossible|better black metal band]]. Read on...

* Find [[fags|friends]] who have long hair. If you can't find any friends (likely), then form a one man band like [[gay|hardcore]] Black Metaller [[basement dweller|Varg Vikernes]]. 

* Buy a drum machine or use the midi you found in the tab program you downloaded to help write your shitty music down.

* Purchase the cheapest amp and the second cheapest guitar from a black person.

* Find a bassist, then kill him or drive him to [[an hero|self-pwn]]. Bass is for faggots anyway, turn that fucking treble up moar!

* Write several songs about vikings, winter, nature, paganism, Satan, Hitler, or Satanic-Pagan Nazi Vikings in wintery nature.

* Kill yourself. You'll go down in Black Metal history as a kvlt god and they will wish you well in [[Hell|Valhalla]].

* Form a [[circle jerk|band]]. Be sure to include an anti-[[Christian]] reference or [[uber]] [[gay|grimm]] [[Norway|nordic]] speak in your name. If you can't think of a name, use this [http://b10m.swal.org/cgi-bin/bandname.cgi Band Name Generator]. Protip: Euronymous will [[zombie|rise from the dead]] and [[in the ass|rape your asshole]] if you decide to include non-evil words.

*<s>Practice the three guitar chords you learned</s> [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|LOL!!!11 DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS!]] Practice requires you to get up off your ass and do something. And three chords is three chords moar than you actually need to play black metal. Just start fantasizing about how your band will lead to you getting back at all the jocks that beat you up; success with all the girls you never had the courage to even talk to; and your dad letting you stay out past 10.

*[[AC/DC|Reptitive riffing ist krieg!]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7piTcDllnY Nargaroth proved that shit!]

* [[srs|Take pictures of a dead bandmate and use it for cover art]]. If you're too lazy to do that, take pictures of a goat; the number 666, or a picture of that girl you like only photoshopped so it looks like she's covered in blood.

* Remove teeth of said bandmate and turn each one into a necklace for [[Dying alone|friends]].

* Be br00tally stabbed to death by a [[Butthurt|sit-in]] [[Faggot|bassist]] 2 years after making said necklaces.

* Record your music in a cave or [[your mom|your mom's]] garage.

* One album is enough. But 100 demos are bare minimum. After the album, only release demos on cassette tapes, preferably limited to 666 copies on badly xeroxed covers with pixelated artwork.

* Re-release the album at least ten years later. Like the above, limit them to 666 copies and smear/number them in your own blood. This guarantees transmission of moar [[AIDS]] and it's already been done by [http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=1954 another band] so you know it's grim 'n' nekro 'n' stuff.

* For lulz! Amass a huge following (roughly eight-ten people) and become an industrial band after ten years. Suddenly tens of thousands of people who weren't fans before will start proclaiming their heart-break over you changing genres on them. This will result in a great boost in popularity amongst [[goths]] towards your newer work and in the sale of your old black metal albums amongst everyone who is [[butthurt]] over this page.

== The Fans ==
[[Image: BlackMetalFans.png|thumb|700px|center|Black metal fans are famous for their mature responses to negative criticism!]]
[[Image: Black_metal_fanboy.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Typical black metal fanboy.]]

[[Image: Anorexic_black_metal_fan.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Even aspies dig black metal.]]

Black metal is exemplified almost entirely by its visual aspect, and thus every black metal musician dresses like a 15 year old goth kid who stole his dad's credit card.

Black metal [[moron|fans]] are obsessed with being "[[stupid|true]]" (or "tr00"), and are viciously territorial and elitist. Newly created black metal bands can be seen with slogans such as "True *Insert location* Black Metal". The biggest lulz example of this is from a Melbourne Black Metal band with the slogan "True Northcote Black Metal". Northcote being a scummy suburb in northern Melbourne, where rapists and pedophiles have the highest winz record.

Most fans have faux-evil screen names like "christkiller", "Goatlust666" or "HotTopicShopper", despite this enticing behavior, most won't lose their [[virgin|virginity]] until the age 25, when they finally get up the nerve to pick up a prostitute. 

Ironically, since all black metal fags worship [[Satan]], they are corollary [[Christians]], as Satan is part of the Christian pantheon. 

Trolling a black metal fan is rather easy. Bash Darkthrone, Mayhem, or Immortal. Talk about how great Cradle of Filth is. <s>Give them a</s> steal their coupon to Hot Topic. These trolling techniques, and many more, will provoke almost all black metallers into a fit of rage. Be warned that some especially tr00 black metal fans aren't kidding about that whole evil priest burning stuff. Don't be surprised that in retaliation for your trolling,  you get a ''really'' nasty PM in your inbox. They may even tell their mom on you.

The battle-cry of the black metal [[fanboy]] is "[[sellout|SELLOUT]]!", similar to the [[furry|furfags]] "[[fursecution|FURSECUTION]]!" Once a black metal artist becomes better known, the kvltfags will flock to the artist's Last.fm page and proceed to bitch about the band selling out in a wank of [[nerd]] rage. Black metal fans often get into heated arguments about which band is more kvlt or whether a band is too mainstream, mainstream being defined as having sold more than two copies of their album.

This cycle of elitism continues until the black metal fan will only listen to the kvltest band from [[Kyrgyzstan]]. One of the fan's favorite phrases is "then black metal is not for you." This is said as a response if you claim to enjoy the music for what it is, instead of reading into it a lot of bullshit philosophy about being better than everyone else because you shop at Hot Topic.

Black metal fans can be found just about anywhere, although MySpace and LiveJournal are generally not "kvlt" enough for them (alhough oddly enough, the food court at mall '''is'''). Your best bet for finding them are special-interest boards, Hot Topic, or in the back seat of mom's minivan. Video games, science fiction and especially fantasy events are full of black metal fans. Any ''Yu-Gi-Oh''-related forums are guaranteed to be swarming with them, so bring your mace.

* Comment on how Black Metal vocals sound an awful lot like a 60 year old man taking a shit.
* Ask if they're going to a Kiss concert if they're in make up.
* Ask them if they know King Diamond. If they do, call them faggots. If they don't, call them posers.
* Tell them that Fuse is a mere copycat of [[MTV]].
* Also mention that Fuse is now shitting out more pop and rap music than metal music.
