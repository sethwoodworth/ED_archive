[[Image:Wiccan_advice_for_furry_homeschooling.jpg|right|thumb|Wiccan advice for furry homeschooling.]]A hot issue in the realm of [[pop parenting]], homeschooling is where some unfortunate child's parents get the idea in their head that they are more qualified than a <s>trained teacher</s> uncaring middle aged asshole who barely passed college by sucking their professor's [[cock]] to educate their child, usually because the public school system will not indoctrinate said child with their [[fundie]] beliefs. For more information, see {{ljcomm|homeschooling}}.

==Origins of Homeschooling==

Homeschooling began [[Last_Thursday|way too long ago]] as a way for parents to ensure their children would never make babies. Because [[neckbeard|abstinence]] plays such a central role in homeschooling, it is commonly accepted that their numbers are increased primarily by conversion of people from outside of the homeschooling circle. However, most folks are about as likely to homeschool as they are to throw away their matches and rub two sticks together to make fire. This ensures that the homeschooling's proliferation never gets out of hand.

==Why People Choose Homeschooling==

Parents generally feel the school system is ill equipped to explain to their child why the world is still flat, or why [[Internet_Humanitarianism|working for the benefit of mankind]] is cooler than [[drugs]] and [[sex]]. Some of them even go and get degrees so they can better assure the rest of the world that it is flat, and that anyone who disagrees with them is a [[fag]] anyhow.

==Pros==
*More time for the internet when your coked up "teacher" isn't looking

*[[Child Abuse]]

*Never being let out of your house

*Compared to [[school|public school]], the education you can get from [[parents|your_mom]] can be a lot better, assuming that they aren't [[aspie|underqualified]].

*Homeschooled students are not subject to the testing requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act.

*[[Incest|Sex Ed Class]]

==Cons==

*"[[lol_wut|We don't believe in dinosaurs]]"

*All homeschooled characters start off with 1 in charisma, and pay double point cost for any and all [[no life|social skills]].

*"I wasn't worried about Becky's education till I went to her school and saw just how many [[Islam|MOOSLEMS]] were there."

*"We want our children to grow up [[drone|thinking balanced and rationally]], reciting Pi to the 108th digit every morning and doing his [[time cube|cube root exercises]] at bedtime"

*[[Conservapedia]]

*[[SAT|You still have to take the fucking SAT]] to get into [[college]].

*[[Andy Schlafly]]

* Your parents micromanage your life.  

* Because of this, homeschool kids are [[over 9000]] times more likely to become [[drug|druggie]] hedonists when they get to [[college]] and finally have some freedom.  Those who don't will spend the entire time studying and having no life, thereby missing out on the best parts of [[college]].
