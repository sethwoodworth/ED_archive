YIFF! The Musical
[[Image:Yiff The Musical logo.png|thumb|350px|[[God]] [[facepalm|is not smiling]].]]

Just when you thought that [[furries]] couldn't get any more flamingly [[gay]], they take the next step - creating a musical - <b>YIFF! The Musical</b> (now known as <b>furReality</b>).

The show was first [[fuck|conceived]] in [[2007]] and for a few years was thought to be [[Lake Angel|dead in the water]] until a new production crew took over, the old production crew being completely sick of the whole fucking thing. A new, full-scale show is supposedly [[gay|coming out]] in [[2010]]. Despite having over three years to think of a plot [[Pathetic|they still have not come up with an ending]].

==The Characters==

[[Image:Castphoto.jpg|thumb|300px|They have the nerve to use the word "lulz".]]

;<b>Russ/RedFox</b>

:Our [[faggot|"hero"]] - A [[teenager|teenage]] fag from [[England]] who, instead of looking for a [[bitch|girlfriend]] spends all his time on the internet fapping to furry porn. Can't figure out why his mother is worried about him.

:RedFox is everything that Russ wants to be, and who he can be online. He's a [[ugly|dashing]], [[goatse|handsome]] fox who can [[lie|move at speed and hunt with tremendous cunning]]. He also knows how to [[Rape|seduce]].

;<b>Primrose Bacon</b>

:Russ' mum is worried about her boy spending all his time on the internet in the company of people who seem weird. She should be. 
Anyone who isn't [[batshit insane]] should.

;<b>Gr1z/AzurePhœnix</b>

:Gr1z, aged 26, and an [[Americunt]]. [[Fail|He's tried to realize his furry dreams, because he's too much of a faggot to do anything.]]

:His fursona is a [[lie|wise]] [[80 year old chinese man in panties|old]] bird. He is very [[retarded|intelligent]], and everyone hates him for it.

;<B>Eric/Xanthinus</b>

:Eric, got into furry a little before Russ/RedFox, also comes from the U.K., and he's there to advise Russ and help him [[bestiality|induct a little into the real life furry community]].

:His fursona is an American yellow ferret with the [[faggotry|power of invisibility]], [[basement dweller|whom he roleplays in detailed RPGs based on the universe of a TV show.]]

;<b>Jeannie/Malvina</b>

:A fat bitch who spent her life shitting out kids instead of [[unrealistic expectations|becoming the supermodel she always wanted to be]].

:Her fursona, a cat called Malvina, is a [[lie|smart, glamorous]] librarian. Surprise, surprise.

;<B>JadeVixen</b>

:A fat balding [[faggot]] who like to pretend he's [[loli]] [[OL]]. Unfortunately our "hero" doesn't discover this until after an evening of slow dancing and yiffing.

;<B>Vernon</b>

:[[Basement dweller]]. No surprises there.

;<B>CanusWolf</b>

:A big bad [[rapist]] - supposedly the villain of the show. Hasn't yet figured out you can't rape the willing, although you can give it a fucking good try.

==The Plot==

<center><i>This text was ripped straight from Wikifur, because no [[ED]] user with any self-respect would ever dare watch this without having his ass raped to the point where he could make [[Goatse]] blush. Except [[Blu Aardvark]]:</i></center>

The story is about Russ, a young English guy of 19, who is a fur. [[Basement dweller|His mother worries about his apparent internet addiction, but he can't tell her what it's all about; she'd never understand.]] 

Russ goes online and starts to mix with the furry community, in particular with a mentor figure from the States called AzurePhoenix, under whose tutelage he establishes his own fursona, RedFox, and first hears of the concept of [[yiff]] - which in his mind becomes a holy grail - the thing that he wants most. He also starts an online romance with [[Alynna Vixen|JadeVixen]], the [[Trap|fursona of a girl]] in the States,(a [[LOL WUT|reference to Alynna Vixen?)]] but his mother is worried about the wolves of the world, and fears that Russ is too innocent and inexperienced not to be harmed. 

Russ and Jade continue to roleplay and yiff online and Russ quickly starts falling in love with her. After Primrose realizes that Russ's sexuality is all bound up with his furriness, she takes action to make sure he [[Oh noes|can't express his furry side]] again by [[Delete fucking everything|cutting off his internet connection.]] 

Driven by his mother's actions, Russ steals her credit card and flies to the United States to attend FurCon - a generic furry convention parodying [[Anthrocon]]. Here he spends days in the presence of other furs(who all are [[Gay|guys.]] At least the show is [[Truth|realistic]]), loving every moment of it. He meets Gr1z, who makes Russ a conbadge to wear. 

Later on into the convention Russ learns that JadeVixen is present at the convention and goes to hunt her down; eventually finding her in fursuit, they begin a duet together, ending with him removing her fursuit head only to find that [[Yiff|JadeVixen is actually a gay man who is already in a relationship with someone else attending the convention]]. (Aren't [[Furfag|all furries gay]]?)

Downhearted, Russ decides to leave the convention, only finding out that his mother's credit card has been blocked when he tries to pay. His mother contacts him telling how she's paid for a plane ticket home and that a taxi is waiting for him. Unable to return to his furry-devoid life back home, Gr1z offers to pay for his convention and invites Russ to live with him. He accepts, and goes on to live his new furry life. 

<center><i>The show itself is only half-finished, and will apparently get a lot [[emo|darker]]. Hopefully someone will get raped, so they can finally understand how their pet dogs feel.</i></center>

===The Show Itself===
Part of the reason the show has taken <i>so ... fucking ... long</i> to get off the ground is because the song, plot, cast - indeed everything - is so cliched and [[boring]] even other furries believe it is a pile of [[shit]]. This alone however could not stop the musical slowly emerging from the depths of the internet into the [[IRL]] world because furries will do anything to be recognised or accepted - whether it be stepping on other [[furfags]] <s>toes</s> paws or embarressing themselves by making their online perversions known to the public.

===Trolling===
Having attracted little attention from the furries, YIFF! has attracted even less attention from the [[trolls|other internet users]], with the exception of one [[fail]] troll:

<center><youtube>Sou99NdQJU4</youtube></center>

<center>{{morphquote|YIFF1|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;

|Obvious troll is obvious.|But sadly not <i>that</i> obvious.

|So let me get this straight. You're so scared of trolls and﻿ antifurries that you just HAVE to attempt to boycott a play/musical that was really just meant for the comedic value. I'm sorry, but you need to stop being a baby. (wah... why do they say mean things to me, why does it hurt so... *sobsobsob*)|[[Trolls trolling trolls|Furries fursecuting furries]].

|Actually, having seen it, I must admit you are right. I'm deeply annoyed that a furry could paint the other members of the fandom﻿ in that manner.|Namely being gay and spending too much time on the internet.

|has no one bothered to check what kind of videos this guy uploads? i find it quite funny that some furries just take stuff like this at face value and consider it an "attack". This is just something someone did for a laugh, its called "trolling":P|But attacks from trolls are the WORST!
