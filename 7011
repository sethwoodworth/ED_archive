'''Ripper''' was the [[IRC]] handle of Brandon Vedas, a guy from Phoenix, [[Arizona]], who [[suicide|committed suicide]] on [[teh]] [[Internets]] via his [[camwhore|webcam]] while his mom was doing crozzwordz in the next room. He told us he was hardcore, and we just didn't believe him. He had a grip of drugs. <nowiki>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</nowiki>shoa. He was fukcin ([[sic]]). 

Quite soon after typing the legendary line '''I told u I was hardcore''', he became [[An hero|an hero]]. 

==[[Ripper/BeforeOD|What He Took]]==

'''Ripper's last words'''

 <ripper><nowiki> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</nowiki>shoa
 <ripper> I'm fukcin

==Great friends==
Like most heavy drug users, Ripper surrounded himself with a [[shit|wonderful]] group of [[stupid|brilliant]] and [[aspie|aspiring]] peers:
 
 <Oea> Hey
 <Oea> If ripper dies
 <Oea> i got tabs
 <Oea> on hsi drugs

Although ripper requested to have people call 911 if he looked dead, the pussy [[faggots]] of his IRC channel were too afraid of getting into trouble. And thus ripper was down for the count like Dracula's homies.

 <Oea> i am on line with 911
 <Oea> is this the right choice?
 <theKat> NO
 <Oea> lolol
 <Oea> i talked my way out of it

==R.I.P. Ripper==
*[http://egomania.nu/princessnatalie.com/fullstory.html Proof that Ripper got so high, he died.] Well, what do you expect? He did tell us he was '''hardcore'''.
*[http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2007/d2007-0152.html ''Respondent has provided no evidence to carry its burden."] Result of a WIPO arbitration hearing filed against klonopinz.com.
