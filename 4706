LORD
'''''Legend of the Red Dragon''''' ('''''LoRD''''') is a text-based [[RPG]] wherein your character is hunting the legendary Red Dragon.. The game took course over the time period of weeks or even months edged out at around ten or fifteen minutes a day and was used primarily to get people to use one's [[BBS|Bulletin Board Service]]. It was one of the first truly "massively multiplayer online role-playing games," despite the fact most BBSes only allowed a few people to play at the same time. [[Geek]]s liked the game because they could flirt, have [[sex]] with, and marry members of the opposite sex, including one of two non-playing characters ([[NPC]]s): Seth Able the bard or Violet the bartender. Seth Able created the game, so I guess he liked the idea of geek girls fucking and marrying him. Who wouldn't? Violet wasn't anyone really, but she was totally hot and many people wanked over her [[IRL]] even though she was an NPC in the truest sense of the word. Awesome.

The game involves magic, fighting, and random events like finding a [[fairy|faerie]] pool, a tavern in the woods, or even getting a [[fellatio|blowjob]] from a magical, disembodied head in a cave.  You can purchase armor and weapons and put money in the bank. Different character types have different skills, like most RPGs. There were also various add-ons people could install - mostly third-party - that would add various events and things to the game, such as extra areas, drugs, new weapons and armor, or even senseless things like a graffiti wall.
