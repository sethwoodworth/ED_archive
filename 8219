'''The Great Habbo Raid of July 2010''' was the 5th [[XBox|major]] [[raid]] on [[Habbo Hotel]], with the cause of fighting [[racism]] and [[AIDS]]. Conducted by the [[faggot|great users]] of [[eBaum's World]], [[13-year-old boy|habbofags]] all over the world [[An hero|killed themselves]] when they realize that they can't [[cyber|create relationships]] in their favorite online swimming pool due to a massive [[Habbo /B/lockade|/b/lockade]] done by the [[awesome]] [[Nigra|men in black]].

It is [[DO IT FAGGOT|highly recommended]] that you use an [[flood|auto-typer]] such as LOLToast's [[Torture|Raid Tool]] while raiding. Read about it and get it at the [http://www.nigrapedia.com/LOLToast%27s_Raid_Tool_v7 Pool's Closed wiki]. [[tl;dr]] it allows you to [[flood]] [[Bel-Air|stuff]] in-game.

'''Attire:''' Regular [[Nigra]] attire.

'''Time:''' [http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?month=7&day=12&year=2010&hour=17&min=0&sec=0&p0=43 (5:00 PM EST/10:00 PM GMT)]

'''Where:'''[http://habbo.com Habbo English] [http://habbo.fr Habbo Surrendering Frogs] [http://habbo.de Habbo Nazi Germany] [http://habbo.it Habbo Fascist Italy]

==Goals and Info==
[[File:Ebaumsdidit.png|thumb|eBaums gets ready]]
===Goals===

* [[Doing it right|Raid the servers '''in order''']]
**'''Ignored. Habbo Italy closes every night, afterparty was in Germany.'''
** '''UPDATE:''' As of 8:26 AM EST, Habbo.com is down!

* Block off every room of its [[AIDS]]
**'''For a moment, most rooms in .com had at least one nigra. Win!'''

* [[Swastika|SwastiGET]]
**'''Completed several times!'''

* Mass log-in to put strain on server for [[Moar|moar]] [[Rape|raep]]
**'''Habbo.com had the resources and moderators of 4 different servers, <s>wasn't even close to breaking down</s> and was eventually shut down for maintenance. Habbo.fr lagged like shit.'''.

* Nigras, stay out of the water unless you want to end up like [[Awesome.jpg|MOD-Omega]].
**'''Only newfags went to the pool, so nothing of value was lost.'''

==Results==

While the [[Win|results of the raid]] weren't as impressive as [[Habbo Hotel|previous raids]], they still generated some lulz
[[File:Siegadvert.jpg‎|thumb|right|Virgin Mary Looking Over Nigras.]]
US: At first it seemed like this would end in massive failure due to a shit load of [[Newfags|retards showing up early]], which resulted in a few mods lurking around the pool and waiting to [[Racism|ban any poor nigras who wandered in.]] However, the mods (being the retards that they are) didn't count on the nigras logging in to something besides the pool, or pretty much every single room for that matter. The server was slowed to a crawl due to [[at least 100]] nigras logging in. During the first part of the raid, [[Win|the welcome lobby was closed, the salon was reset, and several rooms including the library and pool were muted for a while in a desperate attempt by the mods to prevent spam.]]
[[File:NIGRACOSTUME.jpg|thumb|Mods Disable Nigra Attire.]] 
France: No resistance was met from the mods, and just about every single habbo fag was driven out of the pool by the might of the nigras' mighty [[vuvuzelas]] 
[[File:Commuget.jpg|thumb|right|A Rare Commuget.]]
Germany: After conquering France, and a pretty weak re-raid of the US server, the nigras [[Party Hard|partied]] by closing the pool. Some nigras from the #habboraid irc managed to orchestrate a commuget, though [[LOL WUT|failed to recreate the get at the pool moments later]]. Nothing much happened except for a short speech stolen from the 2007 raid.
