'''Facefagging''' is the act of removing a [[/i/|raider's]] mask during an IRL [[raid]] or [[protest]].  Due to the [[/i/|raidfags']] belief that [[Anonymous]] is a secret treehouse club (no [[girls]] allowed), and the fact that all [[/i/|raidfags]] are hideously [[ugly]] in [[real life]], '''facefagging''' is seen as the finishing blow to any raider's real and internet [[loser|social life]].



==How to Facefag==
#Identify target. (Moar than likely you are a [[normal]] person intent on [[trolling]] a bunch of [[i|/i/nsurgency]] clowns.
#Lookout for a group of 17-year-olds who are either [[thin|rail-thin]] or [[fat|man-the-harpoons-fat]]: mostly in black t-shirts with "[[unfunny|funny]]" slogans on them, carrying signs that say things like "Anonymous does not forgive/forget", and, most importantly, sporting [[V|Guy Fawkes masks]]. 
#Stride towards the group with purpose, raising a hand in greeting to throw the [[retard|glass sorters]] off the trail, and then in one swift motion snatch the mask from the nearest [[i|raidfag's]] face.  
#????
#PROFIT!


His cries of anguish as his [[acne|acne-cratered muzzle]] is revealed will let you know that you have succeeded.<br>You can stick around to watch the [[i/|raidfag]] claw his eyes out and melt into a puddle of goo, but you probably<br>have [[fap|better things to do]].
