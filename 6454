Plasma
[[Image:Plasmawikipedia.png|center]]

'''Plasma''', also known as '''Inky''', is a [[moderator|modfag]] [[weeaboo]] from [[711chan]]. When not polluting the gene pool with [[weaboo]] [[faggotry]] such as [[Serial Experiments: Lain]], he metastasizes like the [[The_Cancer_That_Is_Killing_/b/|cancer]] he is through [[lulznet|Partyvan]] [[IRC]]. 
Plasma happens to be an [[emo|emofag]] that attempted to become an [[an hero]] by overdosing on [[drug|Benadryl]] at [[school]], but ended up vomiting on his teacher then proceeded to [[Cutter|cut his wrist]].
==January 28, the Day of [[Extreme]] [[Faggotry]]==
Following the total [[ruination]] of [[711chan]] on January 27 by the [[fucktards]] over at [[the Regime]], Plasma decided to [[unwarranted self importance|call an end to 711chan's involvement]] in [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY]]. He did this by going to the only news agency stupid enough to give him an interview. No, not [[Fox News]] (they only give airtime to [[Goronchev|closeted racist homosexuals]]). We mean Wikimedia - the news extension of [[Jimbo Wales]]'s tiny jewcock. During his [[TL;DR|thrilling]] interview Plasma managed to open his mouth and insert his foot all the way to the knee by saying such mindfuckingly stupid things as:

{{quote|We're probably just going to stay away from the CoS raid. It was poorly managed. We could've brought down a lot more if we weren't just a bunch of unorganized brats| Plasma, clearly [[asking for it]]}}

{{quote|This is not what the raid originally started as. [[Partyvan]] declares this as a threat to the network, and Anonymous alike. We have been under constant botnet attacks, 711chan hacked, and tons of [[drama]] over this. You guys did a very poor job of staying [[Anonymous]]. It's obvious that a lot of you broke rules 1, and 2| Plasma [[Irony|complaining about breaking rules one and two to a major news outlet]]}}

You won't hear Plasma say that [[711chan]] was brought about by the massive [[fail]]ure on the part of the administrators regarding security. This is because there is a 99% chance that the 711 disaster was entirely Plasma's fault and [[711chan]] is apparently as fuckable as [[your mom]]. Plasma seems incapable of protecting his chan from a pack of [[Romanians]], people who got the internet as recently as [[last Thursday]].

The kind [[shota]] swilling [[retards]] at [[711chan]] responded by doing as everyone else on the internet does when Plasma speaks: they thoroughly ignored him and continued [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY|planning the raid]].
