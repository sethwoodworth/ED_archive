Jehochman
{{work|more links to his bullshit.}}

'''Jonathan [[Faggot|Evan]] Hochman''' of West Hartford, Connecticut is a [[Wikipedia Jew]], in the truest sense of the word. Unlike other Wikipedia Jews who pretend that they are building an encyclopedia, Jonathan Cockman is intelligent enough to see Wikipedia as the [[game]] it truly is and play it to his advantage. He can always be seen purposefully drama whoring and grandstanding to gain power and move up the wiki ladder.

==His profession==
[[File:Jechoman.gif|thumb|150px|This man wants to seo you]]
[[File:JEHochman and Li Evans.jpg|thumb|Same as above but without the [[Fat Girl Angle Shot]] combined with the use of [[old|Grecian 2000]]. Maybe a lovely polo neck jumper or a neck brace might help?]]

Jehochman is a [[spam|"Search Engine Optimization"]] consultant and is everything that's fucking wrong with business on the Internet. He is the founder and chief dickbag of [http://www.hochmanconsultants.com/about/ Hochman Consultants] where he assrapes his client for no return. He engages in "COI investigations" against other people using Wikipedia for such purposes, simultaneously using Wikipedia to promote his own business. One wonders what his true motives on Wikipedia are. He believes that Google is the truth police (really no fucking [http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/remove-page-from-google/ joke]) and they should listen to whiny little fucks like him when he stomps his feet. 

He probably isn't all that bothered by this article because it won't show up in the first page of Google results for his name.


==Bull riding==
[[File:Jehochman-hat.jpg|left|thumb|Jehochman wears this stupid hat while masturbating with his IRC buddies.]]
In between designing shitty websites and telling people how to fuck up [[Flash]] even more, he also rides bulls. This is included here to infer that he might be a goddamned [[furry]]. 

Jehochman is a faggot who cruises furry channels on IRC to cyber-YIFF. Not that there is anything wrong with being a [[faggot]], but being a faggot who has to get off on IRC while wearing an animal costume because you're too ugly to cruise for cock in a public park or skanky shower club must be proof of some kind of social maladjustment.

{{squote|<b>Jonathan Hochman, long removed from his bar mitzvah in Philadelphia but by all accounts still a nice Jewish boy at the age of 38, rides bulls. Mean, snot-slinging, hoof-stomping, cowboy-hating bucking bulls. 

"It's a heckuva conversation starter,'' said Hochman, an Internet consultant. "What'd you do this weekend? Oh, I got stepped on by a 2,000-pound Brahma.'']].</b>| [[attention whore|Jonathan Hochman]], better than being sued.}}

==Arbcom==
Jehochman has made two unsuccessful bids to become an [[Arbcom]]mie.

Fore pure drama-whoredom, he loves to step into ongoing Arbcom conversations and clap his hands and stomp his feet making announcements about how he will use his admin magic powers in the dispute. (Clearly no-one else at Arbcom has magic admin powers or decision making ability.) He has no bull in that fight but he wants Arbcom to act faster so he intercedes his own judgment.
