Server admin
[[Image:admin.jpg|thumb|The few, the brave.]]
[[Basement dwelling]] [[troll]] on a power trip.  A low life loser that rains down tyranny and oppression on game servers as though he were Zeus himself, possibly to make up for not being able to stand up to the High School meanies that put his head in the toilet.  Admins frequently get all My Left Foot over swearing or calling someone out on being fucking [[jewish]].  Known for their complete lack of verbal or intellectual skills, the average admin will banish all those that have bested him from his presence.  For example:   

:''Admin: You killed me!  H4X!  BAN!!!''

Admin are also known for constantly contradicting themselves.

:''Admin:  This is an adult server!  No swearing!''

:''Admin:  No putting people down or abusive behavior!  What's that you ****ing ***hole?!  I'll ****ing **** **** *** **** your mother!  BAN!!!''

Another little known FACT:  99% of admins are also [[diaperfur]]s and/or [[otherkin]]s.

For [[at least 100 years]], online gaming has grown in popularity and the hypocritical nature of the admin has grown with it.  To say that one cannot swear on an adult server is a contradiction in terms.  FACT: Adults swear.  FACT:  Killing, as is objectified in any online shooter, is a greater sin than swearing.  FACT:  People who kill other people swear a lot in doing so.  So the argument that "children play these games" is moot.  If you let a child blow someone's face off, that should be allowed to say "FUCK YEAH!!" afterward.
