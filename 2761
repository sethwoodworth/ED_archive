The Exile is an english-language rag printed on the back of oily paper sacks.  It is distributed exclusively on the corners of Moscow's busy internets.  It is written for an audience of American pedophiles that had to emigrate to another country to find cheap children. It's also read by  [[Basement-dweller|basement trolls]] [[like you]].

The Exile is devoted to the [[Trolling IRL|IRL trolling]] of a fascist empire ''in'' that fascist empire.  Letters to the editor are selected purely for [[lulz|LOL]] value and held up for ridicule.  It gives column space to the head of the Russian [[http://img368.imageshack.us/img368/5084/200pxyuliyabh6.jpg National Bolshevik Party,]]  who spent a few years in jail for pranking the Kremlin and [[pedophile|fucking boys]] on the [[Chicago]] subway. It pays a New York Jew to make fun of Comrade Vladivostok Putin, who has killed good [[white people]] for less.  Pretty ballsy.

The Exile has trumped all internet humiliation of [[Attention Whore|LJ whores]], [[camwhores]], and [[IRC|IRC whores]] by hiring and debasing [[Prostitute|real whores]] in just about every issue (complete with their tit shots).  It prints summaries of [[LJ killers|violent crimes]] from the pages of the Moscow police blotter and, for some reason, South Africa.  

It also features highly literate book and restaurant reviews to make it seem intellectual and stuff.
