{{fact|7-Zip's LZMA (7z) format is slower than all its competitors.}}
'''7-Zip''' is [[communist|open source]] compression [[software]] which lacks icons. This old school software is written in [[hardcore|machine code using a calculator]], so it's known to be better than everything written in the whole universe.

=== Why not WinRAR? ===
'''7zip''' lacks everything [[winrar|WinRAR]] has when it comes to [[GUI]]. The icons of the files supported by 7-Zip are also designed in machine language, so they are [[crap|light and fast]], even though the actual [[fact|compression operations are slower than most of the other competitors.]]  <br>

=== Supported Formats ===
7-Zip supports [[Everything|7z, XZ, BZIP2, GZIP, TAR, ZIP and WIM packing and ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, CramFS, DONGS, DEB, FAGGOT, DMG, FAT, HFS, ISO, LZH, DICK, LZMA, LOL, MBR, MSI, CUNT, NSIS, ROFL, NTFS, RAR, HURR, RPM, DURR, SquashFS, UDF, VHD, ASS, WIM, SHIT, XAR and Z. unpacking]].

=== Does this shit get shit done? ===
The main feature of 7-Zip is that 7z format has a better compression ratio (LZMA) than rars because some nerd has found a way to combine zip and [[rar]] algorithms. Ironically, 7zip has a better compression rate of zip files even better than winzip itself. [[Noone]] uses the 7z format anyway because no one has 7-Zip installed, except for some average [[ftp]] search engine users in [[Russia]].

=== Reasons for using 7zip ===
*You are too lazy to copypaste the cracked [[winrar|winrar.exe]] on your winRAR directory.
*You are obsessed with file sizes and are willing to wait for hours to make your files 2kb less.
*You need to compress your files because you are some warez dude who likes to break all copyright rules in the world.
*You like icons that took [[over 9000]] hours to make in [[MS Paint]].
*You don't like using drag and drop. (lol, fai7-zip doesn't support)
*You are a [[open source|communist]]
*You are a [[FAGGOT]]
*You were raped by 7 people who unzipped their pants when you were 7.
*You find the colorful [[winrar]] icons gay and you live with the fear of being gaybashed every minute.
*You need AES-256 encryption in 7z and ZIP formats ([[CP|for avoiding FBI when necessary]]) 
*[[DEAL WITH IT|You are able to deal with the fact that some open source alternative is actually better than the proprietary-licensed competitor software.]]
