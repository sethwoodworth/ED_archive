<b>[http://translationparty.com/#4928028 Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?]</b> was part of a post made on [[4chan]]'s [[V/|/v/]] [[Last Thursday|some time ago]]. Every subsequent post was either an attempt to decipher the phrase or some idiot reposting the question with a [[unfunny|witty]] picture. The thread was about an upcoming game for the Nintendo [[Wii]] called ''The Conduit''. Unfortunately, the [[OP]] of the thread shared a link to a [[YouTube]] video featuring some [[Arab|towelhead]] playing an early release of the game at [[Nerds|ComicCon]]. The video, which hadn't been commented on in weeks, was quickly flooded with comment after comment of the incomprehensible phrase, as well as many variations of it.

Once the meme had a solid foothold on [[4chan]] and [[YouTube]], it began to spread to the rest of the internets, as evidenced by Exhibit D below. Not even social networking sites were spared: [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] soon fell victim to the ubiquitous incoherent inquiry as users, like attention-hungry [[lemmings]], posted the question as their status to confuse the shit out of their [[Prostatot|friends]]. While some mild [[lulz]] ensued, people began to catch on and it quickly became old. Just kidding. It is not old at all, it's greater now than ever before.


==The Original Thread==
{{bigpic|Harbfeadtuegwtdlml_4chan.jpg|frame|250|The thread that started it all.}}

Many speculate of what he was saying, here is an artists rendition of what he may sound like:

== Origins of the "Great Question" ==
Once upon a time in a land known as /b/ one troll destined to wander from the grassy knolls to seek an answer to the question. The troll traveled vast distances to reach /v/ and wandered into the first thread he could find where he posed this question to the people of /v/, but /v/ ridiculed the troll and the troll returned to his home on /b/ where he felt safe as to be the where go near this.

inb4 LIAR!

== Response ==
After extensive flooding of the incoherent text on many websites, a jerkoff who thought he was being witty finally made an unfunny response:<br />
"[[LOLWUT|You've got to be kidding me. I've been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It's just common sense.]]"

== Answer ==
"Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?"

Worded to:

"Has anyone really decided as to even go that far in wanting to do to look more like so?"

Subject - Anyone
Verb - decided (modified by "really" adverb)
Direct object to "decided" - "that" (pronoun modified by "far")
Noun clause that clarifies "that" - "wanting to do" (gerund phrase)
Do what? - "to look more like so"

Meaning:

"Has any video game company really taken such measure to make a game so realistic?"

It has also been proposed by #modacity's abuse of Translation Party that it means "How can anyone use it?", likely referring to the poster's lol at the OP's screenshot. See the translation [http://translationparty.com/tp/#151995 here].

Translation Party has made a good equilibrium: In this example, later, some actually use? For the entire thing, go [http://www.translationparty.com/#5305697 here.]

== [[Engrish]] Version ==


''Even before this, you are actually going to use that anyone would want to make more?''


Translating it to Japanese and then back to English actually makes it make more sense.

Even more sense with:

Even before this, you are actually going to use that "which" anyone would want to make more?
