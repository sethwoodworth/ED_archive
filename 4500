Katamari Damacy
{{stub}}
'''''Katamari Damacy''''', a.k.a. ''Katamari Damashii'' to [[azn]]s or 塊魂 in [[moonspeak]], is a third-person action [[RPG]] for the [[Sony]] [[Playstation 2]]. The gameplay differs from [[typical]] [[MMO]]s [[at least 100]] ways. [[Conspiracy|Katamari Damacy]] was created by the [[Jews|CIA]] as part of its MKULTRA [[Fact|Mind Control]] [[Britfag|programme]] and has delivered [[win|great success]] in this area. The game frequently uses an [[hoax|artistic style]] heavily reliant on [[batshit insane]] [[music]] and [[facts|assumptions]] to disorient the player and de-pattern their [[nothing|brain]]. Once mentally imprinted, you will become an [[Esperanto]] speaker.

This game has also been remade [[at least 100]] times. All of the games in the series include:

*Katamari Damacy (PS2)
*We Love Katamari (PS2)
*Me & My Katamari (PSP)
*Katamari Damacy Mobile 
*Beautiful Katamari (Xbox 360)
*I Love Katamari (iPhone)
*Korogashi Puzzle Katamari Damacy (Nintendo DSi)
*Katamari Forever (PS3)

Each game is pretty much the same, with minor changes to the storylines. It just goes to show that video game companies are quickly running out of ideas for games. That's not to say that there will not be numerous other remakes of this game in the near future.

== The Story == 
Katamari Damacy has one of the most [[win|underrated]] stories of [[Fact|any]] video [[game]]. The [[gamer]] assumes the role of a 10cm tall [[nazi|prince]], who must roll around a sticky [[ball]] that picks up whatever [[cows]], [[Jailbait|children]], and [[weed|trees]] it touches. The prince's [[daddy|father]] is  [[God|The King of All Cosmos]], who has been on an [[alcohol|opium bender]] and threatens to unleash a swift [[rape|punishment]] on his son if his Katamari is anything less than [[over 9000|Perfect]]. [[God|The King of all Cosmos]] is notable for his [[faggotry|style]], [[typical|typically]] speaking in [[verbose|verbosities]] and dressing like a [[hipster]]. 


== Gameplay == 
The goal of Katamari Damacy is to [[holocaust|depopulate]] the world by [[pwn|collecting]] [[shit noone cares about|all of the objects you see before you]]. [[Some argue]] that the idea for this gameplay model was [[e-theft|stolen]] directly from the [[nazi]]s and their actions in [[fake|the holocaust]].

Making a Katamari is just like writing an article for [[ED]], the [[lulz|lulzier]] you make your [[ball|Katamari]] the less [[butthurt|pain]] [[daddy|The King]] will inflict on you with his [[penis|lengthy monologues]]. [[Lulz]] are awarded on a points basis as follows:
*[[Jews|Nothing to See Here]] - 1 [[lulz]] each
*[[Drug]]s - [[advertising|Market Value]]

These are the only two things [[daddy|The King]] wants in Katamari Damacy, besides [[you|the Prince's]] [[gay|boy-hole]] of course.

When [[azn|namco]] made Katamari Damacy they accidentally multiplayer. As a result, the multiplayer portion of the game would leave any [[basement dweller|gamer]] pining for [[halo|rockets on blood gulch]].

If your katamari does not meet Our high standards, We shall charge Our lazorz and turn all of those people you rolled up into stardust.  Hey, it's your fault, Prince.

== Levels ==
* Make Virgo: Roll up [[virgins]] for the King.  Bitches be all over my balls.
* Make Cancer: Get [[crabs]]
* Cowbear level: AHH! FUCK YOU! Traffic cones are not fucking [[BBW|cows]]!
* Roll up the World: You don't want to know what the King and Queen were doing in there.
* [[Flower]] level: God is a girl.  And his name is [[Eris]].
