# An ingenious poster posts a topic which will divide public opinion dramatically. Debate ensues.
# Fairly rapidly, two 'teams' (let us call them 'Alpha' and 'Omega') develop based almost purely on previously forged friendship alliances and very rarely on the actual topic.
## If a poster from team Alpha makes a comment, every single poster from team Omega will tell them what a complete fucktard they are.
##* To each of Omega's comments, each member of team Alpha will make a retaliation comment.
## If a poster from team Omega makes a comment, every single poster from team Alpha will tell them what a complete fucktard they are.
##* To each of Alpha's comments, each member of team Omega will make a retaliation comment.
## Internet explodes.


And so on, and so forth.
