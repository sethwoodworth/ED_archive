'''ThatGuywiththeGlasses.com / Channel Awesome''' (AKA Mike Michaud's Home for Battered Ex-[[ScrewAttack]] Members and Rejected [[YouTube]] Partners) is a website consisting of several terribly [[unfunny]] video contributors drowning in a sea of equally terrible member content. It is the Auschwitz of video sites due to all the Jew contributors producing [[That_Guy_With_The_Glasses#Little_Miss_Gamer.2FPBC_Productions|videos there]]

A typical Channel Awesome video usually entails a [[cosplay]]ing [[cam-whore]] awkwardly staring at the camera whilst [[trying too hard]] to be witty, sarcastic and funny in a Jeremy Clarkson/Charlie Brooker-esque manner. They either miss the point of several factors in a TV show/movie/video game, nit-pick the most trivial flaws, or miss out on potential gags. This is all done whilst being cut between video cameos of other TGWTG members having pre-scripted, poorly acted arguments. Along with 99% of the videos being commentary on other media, most of their "humor", [[forced meme]]s, and general identity comes from repurposing, parodying, or outright stealing from [[YouTube]] clips of jokes from [[Monty Python]] or other movies/TV shows, so next to nothing they make is actually theirs... much like [[Carlos Mencia]].

These are then all followed up by several pages of ass-kissing or [[butthurt]] fans, saying how excellent or incorrect their chosen messiah is. These same people then travel on over to [[Wikipedia]], [[TV Tropes]], and other similar sites to rewrite the relevant work page to conform to their opinion and spam the site with as many unfunny quotes and memes as they can possibly shoehorn. It's an effect not quite unlike [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/]].

{{quote|I know it's just a bunch of 20-somethings having fun, picking on the easy targets for laughs, not truly an attempt at academic criticism, etc etc. Still, he's getting a little too used to confining himself to TGWTG where he can say or do anything and hordes of fans will jump in to spew blind praise before they even finish watching it, as well as pounce on anyone who criticizes him. Kind of ironic, really, that the "critics" on this site surround themselves with fans that stifle any criticism.|
Finally, somebody with a brain on this site!}}

After Doug Walker was kicked off [[YouTube]], a [[Danielspengies|bald, fat man]] by the name Mike Michaud immediately jumped on the chance to give Doug his own website so he could suck in [http://www.suntimes.com/business/spirrison/1653029,CST-FIN-spirr06.article 10,000 fucking dollars a month] from his loyal monkey. Mike also founded Channel Awesome so he could make even more money from the internet's many [[Chris-chan|man-children]], and ultimately decides which talentless hack can post reviews on his website. Most of these reviewer parasites follow the shtick of giving themselves Ad-Lib-style names like "That (Noun) with the (Noun)" or some variation of "Critic" in [[Plagiarism|honor]] of their sugar-daddy who lets them distribute their shitty videos on his egocentric website.

[[Image:NostalgiaCritic 7.gif|thumb|left|Doug Walker]]
'''Doug Walker''' ''(AKA That Guy With Way Too Many Fucking Pseudonyms)'' is TGWTG's original [[manchild]] and the most recognizable contributor on the site. He creates a wide range of content which are all plagued with [[forced meme]]s, insane amounts of misinformation and self-contradicting opinions, and near constant [[ear rape]] produced by his own mouth. His most popular routine involves [[old meme|reviewing various movies from the 80s and 90s,]] describing them as being "nostalgic," despite that being a subjective term which almost noone applies to the shitty obscure movies he reviews nowadays. Not only does he suffer from chronic [[unfunny|unfunniness]] and a serious case of [[USI]], but he's also a complete fucking [[idiot]] who doesn't even try to make sure his facts are accurate and is willing to damage his own vocal cords in the name of being as loud and obnoxious as possible.

== The Nostalgia Chick Contest ==
Being the [[virgin|pimp]] that he is, Nostalgia Critic held a competition allowing whichever female user could suck his dick dry to partake in reviewing shitty stuff with him under the moniker the Nostalgia Chick. Three contestants entered.

=== The Dudette / Nostalgia Chick ===
[[Image:Nostalgia_Chick_by_Soemele.jpg|thumb|left|Let this image haunt your nightmares, fanboys!<br>This is the cover for the "Kickassia: Soundtrack" in death-metal version<br>(NOW WITH 30% MORE ROYALTY-FREE TRACKS!!!<BR>Only $40 on the Asshole Store)]]
{{blueblink|HOLY SHIT! SHE ABORTED HER FIRST DAUGHTER!}} 
'''Lindsay Ellis''' is a smug [[leftard|leftarded]], [[Apple|Mactarded]], [[vegetarian]], [[slut|nigger-loving]], [[feminism|feminist]] [[artfag|film student]] with a shit degree from San Diego that reviews movies and TV shows catering to [[loli|young girls]]. After swallowing every last drop of NC's cum with a smile on her face, the Dudette quickly found herself [[facial|crowned]] the Nostalgia Chick. Upon seeing a [[guro|very special work of art]] from a [[stalker|loyal fan]], she quickly pondered [[flounce|quitting the internet]], only to review [[Michael Bay|Armageddon]] in September. 

When Lindsay suspends her [[propaganda|feminist rhetoric]], she routinely [[white guilt|over addresses racial stereotypes]] even in the subtlest to nonexistent instances. Through such feats as dancing like a [[retard]] in public and dragging her [[fat]], ugly nerd friend [[Wop|Nella]] into all her videos, she actually manages to be less funny than Doug. She currently reviews pop culture music in an attempt to prove that women are useful for more than [[In the kitchen|making sandwiches]] and being beaten/raped ''('''SPOILER ALERT:''' They aren't)''.

Despite Lindsay's loudly espoused [[leftard|Current TV hipster politics]], every male [[fanboy]] on TGWTG never fails to praise even the worst video she shat out, including a half-assed review of the Last Unicorn where she literally went [[boring|hiking]] and "improvised" her analysis (read: [[lazy| she pulled the script right out of her ass]]). Although she won't date any of her fans (unless the individual is either a black person or a [[Indian|curry muncher]]), her fans collective sexual desperation stands as the only explanation for their mindless devotion, which extends to grossly overpaying for [[Jesus|anything this bitch touches]]. For instance, when she was selling her [[shit|useless crap]] on eBay to help pay for her [[shit nobody cares about|Master's Thesis]], her $0.25 bowtie sold for [[over 9000|over $500 fucking dollars]]. Even [[GoddessMine]] couldn't pull a trick this good. Unfortunately, so long as their fans remain permavirgins devoid of any dignity, Lindsay Ellis will stand above criticism in the eyes of her fans. 

It has come to the attention of fans (who might not give a shit) that Lindsay had an abortion. Apparently, her mother was raped at one point in her life and had one too. [http://literature-and-water.blogspot.com/2010/12/a-word.html So she decided to make a film about her dead fetus.] Literally days after this premiered, Doug Walker thought it would be funny to do a It's a Wonderful Life parody. In this travesty of a one sketch, it involved Lindsay being successful and didn't have the abortion if Doug was never born. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT-gr97cq0M Thanks for keeping it classy, Doug.]

'''Kaylyn ''[[Dicks]]''ion''', TGWTG's obligatory [[weeaboo]] [[dyke]] dwelling in some rock near [[San Antonio]], [[Texas|TX]], spends the majority of her time blithering about her latest convention attendance and ranting about [[shit nobody cares about|why cartoons/animation suck these days besides anime]]. If you don't love [[anime]], then she'll [[h8]] you. Her latest series, [[shit|"Anime News Editorial"]], is about as entertaining as nailing your dick to a wooden plank, and she continues to ramble on about some [[shit nobody cares about|piece of anime news that 99.9% of the rest of the world doesn't give a shit about]]. While she's not blabbering about being able to go to Japan while all of you [[fag|losers]] can't, she is [[lulz|bitching out the fans who watch her videos]] about manga being taken down from the internets because it's illegal to [[shit nobody cares about|scan and translate them]]. She has done this three times now.

This may cause [[lulz]] to ensue if she keeps this up.

She's also [[slut|cool with being 34'ed]] as evidenced [http://marzgurl.wordpress.com/2009/06/05/fans-what-a-strange-bunch/ here], which appears to redeem her shitty character, but anyone with an IQ of room temperature would know that's like being cool with someone taking a bat to your totalled car.

=== The Cinema Snob===

[[File:YurisRevenge.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Mike Michaud, about to [[mind control|discuss business]] with Brad Jones.]]

'''Brad Jones''' ''(AKA The Cinema Snob)'', is a complicated person. At first glance he appears to be well-informed, focused, and overall a [[pretty cool guy|pretty normal guy]] who reviews [[Troll 2|cult classics]] and Vintage [[Porn]] (srsly), but that couldn't be any farther from the truth. In reality, Brad is a troubled man trapped in a fruitless struggle to resist the urge to succumb to the [[unfunny|unfunniness]] that eventually overwhelms anyone who becomes a Channel Awesome contributor with any amount of talent, regardless of how little that amount may be.
[[Image:Cinemasnob.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brad Jones back when he still had free will.]]
Brad has a tendency to get [[pussy|sympathy]] from those who normally troll or criticize TGWTG contributors due to the fact that he seemed to avoid the usual [[Angry Video Game Nerd|"Angry Nerd"]] shtick that most reviewers go for before he started getting [[rape]]d by Channel Awesome's cock, [[lie|which he seems to have some resistance to.]] Nevertheless, there has been an evident decline in his work since he became affiliated with the Million Manchild March. He has began producing Spoony-esque vlogs about boring shit and has created a fucking horrible show called "Brad Tries..." where [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/bj/bs/26571-coca-cola-blak he consumes disgusting beverages] made over [[100 years ago]]. The review series that made him famous has become spotted with the shouting and crossovers that plague [[Spoony|other fallen contributors']] work. 

Despite the obvious [[fact]] that trying to save Brad from [[Anti-lulz|the inevitable]] has become a lost cause, some insist in continuing to fight to preserve what's left of Brad's free will. These people are doomed to [[fail]] horribly, so [[you]] are advised to just forget Brad ever existed.  Although he recently proved himself to have somewhat of a sense of humor.  When asked about Encyclopedia Dramatica during a livestream, he answered with "I've got pretty thick skin, if I can make fun of stuff constantly on my site, then people should be able to make fun of me."

=== Film Brain ===

[[Image:Spoony-Vs-FilmBrain.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[That_Guy_With_The_Glasses#The_Spoony_Experiment|SpoonyOne]] is a huge fan of Film Brain's opinions.]]

'''Film Brain''' is some limey [[13 year old boy]] by the name of Mat[t]hew Buck, who thinks pointing out why bad movies are bad makes him cool. He gained some success by pointing out the obvious crap that makes the crapfest movie [[The Matrix|''Equilibrium'']]. But this was short-lived as he started to call out good films as bad. With his Brit accent, it's a close call to declare him a smarmy git or just ''really'' [[WASP|British]]. He also appears to have been taught at the "[[Irate Gamer|Chris Bores]] School of Acting" as he can only ever emote in one expression, sarcasm... and even that's done badly.

Occasionally, this pretentious foetus will fuck up jokes by having no idea what he's talking about (i.e., ''Quantum Leap'' doesn't work that way). I mean, why even bother alluding to a TV show or movie when you don't even know the basic premise? Even fellow reviewers on TGWTG have offered to "slap [Film Brain] until the stupid falls out", and it would be his most popular video too. It's also well known to note that he liked [[Uwe Boll|''Transformers II'']] better then a [[Poser|Tarantino]] movie, which is why people have offered to kill him. Besides this, Film Brain has a strange tendency to *bleep* out [[fuck]] in one video, but then saying the same word uncensored in the other. I mean, WHAT THE [[fuck|*bleep*]]?!

It's interesting to note that Film Brain speaks, acts, and even kind of looks like Drop Dead Fred, a character that the Nostalgic Critic claims to loathe and wish violent death on. [[Do it faggot|So why hasn't he killed him yet]]?

Also, in accordance with his shitty videos and taste, Film Brain is the one of two admins of the ENTIRE FORUMS OF TGWTG, making him the main [[Moot|perpetrator]] as to why it's always filled with [[furfaggotry]]. He is also known to lock threads and ban users for "feeding the trolls," a term he uses to describe any instance of criticizing Channel Awesome contributors or [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=25947 discussing the Busy Street ''Kickassia'' commentaries].

They say that the camera adds ten pounds to you, so fuck knows how many '''HopeWithinChaos''' has on him when he films. '''Sean Fausz''' is a beached whale of a man, with more rolls of fat than [[That_Guy_With_The_Glasses#Bennett_the_Sage|Bennett]] could ever hope to have. Of course this led to [[Doing it wrong|an early heart attack]] at the young age of 20 in March, 2010. Doug, worried that another slave might stop working, has been [http://twitter.com/TGWTG_/statuses/9544473730093056 worried ever since].

HopeWithinChaos fails so hard, even [http://youtube.com/user/howdoishotweb howdoishotweb] blushes in embarrassment. Like his chunky compatriots, Sean is insufferably [[unfunny]]. His main claim to fame, [[Epic Fail]], is a show based on collecting stale memes from a million years ago, mixing them with commentary that is so unfunny even [[furries]] would [[facepalm]] in disgust, and regurgitates them onto the site much to the glee of his [[no one|few fans]]. It's essentially like ''America's Funniest Home Videos'', only if [[Bob Saget]] had a full frontal lobotomy, became a target for Japanese fisherman, and showed clips of videos that have been seen by everyone and their grandparents.

HopeWithinChaos seems to be in some denial about his [[man the harpoons|weight problems]]. He has made statements such as "I'm not into sports much", as if that would surprise [[noone|anyone]].

'''Lewis Jew''' is Channel Awesome's resident [[comic]] book reviewer, mainly because he's the only person willing to make weekly videos about shitty comic books exclusively for TGWTG.com. His "reviews" are essentially Doug Walker's patented [[doing it wrong|"Summarize the entire plot and spoil everything while complaining about irrelevant bullshit"]] reviewing style adapted to an artistic medium that nobody gives a shit about. It is a well known [[fact]] that none of Linkara's fans have any interest in comic books and only watch him because his [[unfunny|humor]] appeals to the [[retard|same demographic]] the Nostalgia Critic does. Linkara's reviews are also lined with [[conservative|right-wing]] bias and [[Sarah Palin|psuedofeministic]] rants which are even more retarded than his usual ramblings about [[Batman]].

Obscurus Lupa is another unfunny addition to the cesspool that is TGWTG. When TGWTG realized that the site was a complete cockfest, they foolishly decided that the proper remedy was to get more women reviewers ([[Tranny|IRON LIZ DOES NOT COUNT]]). Her main claim to fame was, aside from being fappable material for the [[fanboy|TGWTG fanboys]], her review on The Room being removed as we doubt any one has actually seen it to care about it.

Oddly enough, she was only drafted to the site '''after''' one of it's main forum contributers created a video of [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7AV8Echg2Q who should be on the site.] This was probably to give the sad, sad people of the TGWTG forum [[Impossible|some hope]] that they too can get on the site. Her gimmick consists of ripping off the Cinema Snob and reviewing obscure and shitty movies, thus proving that ThatGuyWithTheGlasses is really devoid of all creativity if it hires uninspired tripe that clearly can't come up with something more original. In other words, she is a shining example that [[truth|the internet is home to nothing but camwhores and basement-dwellers]] who are retarded enough to believe that making fun of bad movies is original and [[lulz|lulzy]].

[[File:Pawtgwtg.jpg|thumb|left|200px|PawDugan]]

Paw AKA Paul Schuler is the OG music reviewer for TGWTG. Paul's most notable show talks about [[Music|music he liked growing up]]. He is personality and content wise very boringly undramatic, if not outright bland. He even makes [[Let's Plays]] and shitty pixel art videos that make [http://www.nuklearpower.com/2001/03/02/episode-001-were-going-where/ 8-Bit Theater] look like Studio Ghibli. He's also enlisted his girlfriend PushingUpRoses to help make more worthless content for TGWTG.

=== Phelous ===

[[File:FAILousTGWTG.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Phelous]]

'''Phelan Porteous''' (AKA The Diet Coke Cinema Snob) hails from [[Canada]]. He was picked up by TGWTG when they were in a charitable mood and wanted to help promote [[lie|talent]] from a third-world country. FAILous reviews shitty 80's or low budget horror movies that no one gives a fuck about.

Due to his inability to act, let alone emote in his show, Phelan is the video equivalent of a manic-depressive. He acts in a sombre, dry, nonchalant persona one moment, but then immediately goes hyper-active, flailing his arms about like an epileptic on fire the next, all whilst intercutting between pointless scenes and having shitty cameos from other TGWTG-tards, normally SadPanda (A Frenchman with a head shaped like Mr. Makey from [[South Park]]). While he used to just take on the dry and boring persona in the past, he saw how shitty the other contributors were getting so he took his videos to the next level and achieved [[Truth|the Absolute Zen of Shit]].

But the biggest irony of all is how much Phelous likes to condemn the actors poor acting skills in his reviews, when he really needs some lessons himself. To add even more too it, he often makes fun of the other contributors for having [[crossovers]] and "continuity" in their reviews, and yet he is constantly doing the same shit himself. But apparently it is okay because he always points how utterly stupid these gimmicks are and it is therefore [[hipster|ironic]]. 

Not surprisingly, he's taken on another pastime that his fellow members love to do as well: [[shit nobody cares about|FUCKING LET'S PLAYS]]. For a site that wants to be recognized as a serious internet television channel, you'd think they would have higher standards than allowing this [[shit]] to waste space on their servers. 

FAILan also comes from the [[Tgwtg#Angry_Joe|Angry Joe]] school of Chroma-keying, as he is a notable green-screen-fag.

Rap with a capital "C".  He's a critic of rap. Just a black person version of [[TITS]] (see below) who doesn't [[fap|mash]] on a keyboard to get his points across.

The Rap Critic was also another TGWTG forum contributor (like Obscurus Lupa) who got to the main site. It's hard to believe Channel Awesome took more than one person from the forums to contribute to the site. He's known to review boring rappers from [[last thursday|yesterday's]] time and some today but that doesn't excuse the grand fail that this critic upholds upon this crappy site.

=== Todd In The Shadows / [[TITS]] ===

[[File:Toddintheshadows.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Todd In The Shadows]]

Todd In The Shadows ([[I see what you did there|TITS for short]]) is the newest upbringing to the [[Epic_Toilet_Story|shitfest]] that is TGWTG.

So, what's his gimmick? He's an [[AVGN|angry reviewer]]. Of course, how original. Only this one does music. Mainly pop or rap music. Todd complains about how musicians, unlike himself, are making a shit ton of money while he's on the internet talking about them. So he'll play a shitty tune every now and then to get his [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|point across]]. Believe me, he's got some serious tastes too. Usher can't fucking compare to the greatness that is Sonic Youth or [[Nirvana]]. Even these music videos accompanying the songs are too confusing for him. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfYSiKRQo4s AMV's] would be up to his speed.

If you haven't noticed already, Todd always keeps the lights off. You may call it a [[Hoax|gimmick]], but in reality Todd is fearful of showing his face on the internet. According to a previous conversation on [[That_Guy_With_The_Glasses#LordKaT|LordKaT's]] live video stream, Todd happened to catch a severe case of [[Genital_Herpes|herpes]]. As the story goes he went down on some [[Babyfur|furry girl]] at a convention where he awoke the next day covered in cold sores.

Todd has of as late released both a commentary of an earlier review and an almost half-hour long v-log of rambling, which pretty much has sealed his fate as Spoony's new apprentice. So you can look forward all of his future shenanigans being v-logs of nothing but boring yapping, shameless begging for votes in order to win the Mashable awards, the introduction of "wacky" characters and an over-controlling hambeast of a girlfriend, and, of course, lots and lots of raging against a former fanbase that has rejected him for turning lazy and unfunny.

= Bar Fiesta =

Supposedly a Channel Awesome site that was going to cover the nightlife in [http://www.barfiesta.com/ Chicago]; it has only two posts, and supposedly its lauch date was going to be at 9/1/2010:

However, as is predictable with anybody with their heads this far up their asses, the site failed abysmally, and it has been cast into the shadows of obscurity. See, having a manchild "cewebrity" isn't cause for expecting every single website made and managed by the TGWTG crew to be an instant success. Speaking of other websites opened by the TGWTG crew...

[[Image:BT logo.jpg|185px|thumb|left|Blistered Thumbs]] 

Blistered Thumbs (previously named: [[Irony|Bored Shitless]]) was created when TGWTG decided they weren't ripping off [[AVGN]] enough. So realizing that the [[Internets]] really didn't give a shit about a review site unless the subject matter was video games, they desperately whored up a bunch of random [[video game reviewers]] from all over the Internet, the majority being ScrewAttack rejects.

Since Doug has received far too many [[butthurt|complaints]] from his cock worshippers, the admins have finally decided to give this pile of shit its own site. Ironically, however, more and more people are visiting TGWTG in order to watch this shit (probably because nobody cares about movies, just video games).  So one can now notice Nostalgia Critic updates being rammed up the ass of visitors to the site because nobody gives a shit about Channel Awesome's precious leading manchild anymore. [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/specials/28376-blistered-thumbs-recruitment-apply-now  Angry Joe posted a video] begging kids to copy/paste existing articles from better websites and rewrite them. They're not compensated for their work and they won't get any real credit for college or the actual journalistic field, but hey!, at least you could get know the staff from Channel Awesome and participate on their podcasts and crossover movies (a.k.a Shitassia 2: [[Electric_Boogaloo|Electric Boogaloo]]).

=== Angry Joe ===

[[Image:AngryJoeConstipation.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Angry Joe,<br/>at the toilet.]]
 
Get it? He's angry. DURR HURR HURR HURR. Angry Joe (IRL name '''<strike>Joe Vargas</strike> [[Dirty Sanchez]]''') is a spiked crewcut homo [[beaner]] that essentially serves as TGWTG's answer to the AVGN, <s>or as a placemarker until they can nab someone more popular</s> ''NO WAIT, They have Dr. Ashens now!!!'' 

He is the not-recognized son of Germán Valdez "Tin Tan" and likes to portray himself as a brave and righteous hero that fights the good fight against the [[Bobby Kotick|big evil gaming corporations]], and believes he is [[USI|the voice of all gamers on the internet]]. He is aided in his crusade by his loyal [[fanbase]], the so-called "Angry Joe [[Army]]", who will buy anything he tells them to buy, gloating about their [[Unrealistic Expectations|combined purchasing power]]. However, he has proven himself more than willing to [[buttsecks|screw]] his fanbase over by stealing their ideas and begging them for various kinds of [[blowjob|services]].  Not to mention the fact that he thinks "fighting [[The Man]]" means jizzing over the hottest 1st party property out on any given week and ignoring the Indie Gaming scene entirely.  Naturally, as original as video game reviewers can be, his [[plagiarism|trademarks]] consists of the same [[Superman]] shirt and a theme song shamelessly ripping off G.I. Joe.

In Mr Vargas' defence, he is quite possibly the hardest working Mexican on the face of the planet.  Joe manages to spew out at least [[Over 9000|ten]] videos a day for TGWTG,  all of which will be viewed by no one due to them all being the same fucking thing.  If you've seen one Angry Joe video,  you've seen them all...  and they're all shit!!!

Joe's usual video consists of him pretending to become enraged over some insignificant segment of a video game/recently released movie...  for ten minutes (all encased in a slew of shitty green screening and [[Adobe|after effects]]). When it is quite apparent (either from his lack of acting ability or true opinion) that he clearly doesn't give a fuck IRL and is only making this pretend emotion to make moar monies on Blip.  Sadly, the only people to call him out on his pretend [[emo]] faggotry were the members of [[The_Spoony_Experiment|Spoony]]'s forums who've presumably been banned for saying anything but blind praise to Spoony's friends. Still, for the rest of the Internets, Angry Joe fails harder than [[Irate Gamer|the very retard he imitates]].

[[Image:Lt._Lisa_Foiles.jpg|thumb|right|[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV2iI4W-Xfs Not even fellow TGWTG contributors like Lisa Foiles.]]]
Recently, Joe went from having the most effects-laden show of the entire TGWTG crew to actually upgrading his show.  Much more impressively however, he brought on a sidekick:  a busty blonde chick.  Despite the obvious fact that she was acquired in the course of human trafficking from Tijuana, Joe has on his show a chick who is light-years out of the league of any other TGWTG fan or contributor.  Sidekick Lisa Foiles has her own upstart video game review show on The Escapist, and predictably enough it is shit.

Unfortunately, due to a total lapse in US border control, he sadly wasn't thrown back over the border to [[Mexico]] during his recent trip to Nevada to film the [[TGWTG#Kickassia|2nd Anniversary video]].

==== Angry Joe vs. Geoff Keighley ====



For years like most stupid gamers Angry Joe made a huge deal about the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1wOui5b31w Spike TV VGAs] being [[Irony|awful and a misrepresentation of gaming culture]]. Yes this show is indeed shitty, but neither the industry or the actual audience watching cares to throw a tantrum like Joe does. Nobody cares if they win an award and don't promote it as much as an actual award like the [http://www.gamechoiceawards.com/ Game Developers Choice Awards.] Life goes on and more games are made without any alterations from the show. Joe doesn't feel that they fucking care about your petty concerns as a gamer and wants to be your voice, which is apparently the voice of an annoying douche bag spic with a faggy mustache who's the son of your cleaning lady and wants you to keep him entertained until she's done fucking your dad in the next room. So all you hear is stupid ranting and dumb nitpicks in front of a green screen about something he has zero control over.



<center><youtube>SmsUk9nmIuc</youtube></center>


Since there wasn't enough evidence to prove that Joe is incapable of being a reviewer or having any outside contact with normal people, Joe was invited to the 2010 Spike TV VGAs. Instead of being grateful as being recognized from his 5th rate site as an actual journalist, [http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2010/11/angry-joe-vga-2010/ he decides to make a video where he pisses on his host's face.] Geoff Keighley all around nice guy and professional journalist thought it would be funny to fuck with Joe. So instead of deleting his email and ignoring him forever, he grants him his invite. In another video update [http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2010/12/vga-victory/ Joe considers this a huge blow against him.] Joe now asks of his fans to write questions to ask Geoff in a 15 minute interview he was promised. After all being a professional journalist Joe couldn't come up with his own questions and do his own research before walking into the lion's den known as the Spike TV VGAs.♠

So Joe sets out for the show without any preparation to spit hot fire about his retarded agenda. When Joe and his gay camera man arrives we see that he is put in the dead last spot for the press and Geoff doesn't want to even talk with him. After all Geoff is a busy man and he's got to make sure this entire show runs smoothly and could wait until after to talk with Joe. Joe is so frustrated that he can no longer wait.  Eventually he convinces some girl to make Geoff talk with him where Geoff tells him he's got a few minutes which Joe claims it was two. From this moment on we see [http://www.blisteredthumbs.net/2010/12/geoff-keighley-vgas-interview/ the worst gaming journalist interview put on film] as Geoff tears this rookie's asshole in half like a phone book, all while Joe seems to be constantly on the edge of crying like a little girl. Joe then bitches how he let everyone down and is a complete failure, but it was not his fault.

[[Image:Spoonytweetaboutangryjoevga.png|thumb|right|Even Spoony is too stupid to understand when someone fucks up.]]


The outcome of this weighs in with the drooling dipshit fans who think Joe was absolutely right and Geoff was an asshole. Joe is apparently considered a misunderstood hero who's rights have been trampled upon. Anyone who's not part of TGWTG, knows about journalism, likes videos games, or is considered a normal human being think Joe is the biggest retard in the world. Not only did Joe burn any bridges with getting future invites to the show, but anyone in the video game industry that sees this will forever pan their site from being considered as journalists. So all outside sources from TGWTG start to throw their opinions about Joe back at him without the risk of being instabanned from Blistered Thumbs. Joe starts to pick a fight with one called imagesfromapoet no less than a half hour after the video was uploaded. She later blocked her comments, [http://www.megaupload.com/?d=IBT02QYZ but we've saved them all for you.]

=== Ashens ===

[[Image:Ashens.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ashens]]

'''Ashens''' (Real Name '''Stuart Ashen''') is a popular UK Youtube star who loves to review bootleg consoles and cheap knock offs from China. Ashens went the typical Youtube star route and sold out by making DVD's of the same videos you can view for free online. He also has unfunny gimmick characters that he likes to insert into the middle of his unscripted rambling. Mike Michaud apparently was flat broke and needed Ashens to help fill in another spot on his site. So he suckered in Ashens to we hope raise some money for a homeless shelter.

=== Awesome Video Games ===

[[File:Awesome Video Games.jpg|thumb|left|Awesome Video Games]]

'''Awesome Video Games''' ''(also known as '''"FarFromSubtle"''' or '''"Fraser"''' on TGWTG'') are another bunch of fuck head video makers from the third world country that is [[Canada]].  AVG created a one-off [[unfunny]] sketch about two [[PRO TIP|GamePro]]/Bill and Ted-esque 80's teens making a show about 8-bit video games,  '''BACK IN 2006!!!'''.   They saw that this sketch was popular and just kept making it over and over and over to the point they've been flogging this dead horse of a series for so long that you'd be able to drink the remains.

Awesome Video Games are also the [[Buy a dog|Littlest Hobo]] of the internets, as in they've been pummelling this one gag-piece of shit show back and forth to any website retarded enough to host them.  They started out on [[AVGN|ScrewAttack]], before setting sail for [[YouTube]], then [[Newgrounds]], then [[Machinima|Machinima.com]] and are now currently residing on TGWTG.  Why the fuck Channel Awesome picked up these whores is beyond anyone's comprehension.   Though they'll soon fuck off to [[The Escapist]] or Destructoid when it suits them (normally when they're not being paid enough, or just don't like their current audience).

As with most video game "E-celebs" on the the internet,  they've noticed that making an episode actually takes effort, so they've now fallen back to "Let's Plays" which consist of them sitting on a couch and staring at a TV screen while the viewer sees it at an awkward 45 degree angle.  Which as strange as it even sounds is even more painful to endure.  Where the fuck is [[Retsuprae]] when you need them?

=== Bennett the Sage ===

As banal as they come, Bennett stands as a classic example of Blistered Thumbs' [[fail]].

Recently, Bennett decided it was going to be [[hurr|very funny]] to read [[Fan Fiction]] for the internet, and decided to read the [[Che Guevara|overrated]] monstrosity of the internet "[[My Immortal]]" because he wants to be on the [[pussy troll|"good side"]] of ED in case [[Fursecution|shit gets real]]

=== Benzaie ===

[[Image:Benzaie.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Benzaie,<br/>Pondering whether heterosexuality has ever existed in France, which is like wondering whether gun ownership has ever existed in America.]]

A [[redundant|gay French man]] (is there any other kind?) who talks about video games no one cares about in an accent that no one can understand. And like most of the other videos on TGWTG, ripping off a show [[Chris-chan/Videos#Interviewed_by_Guru_Larry_of_ScrewAttack_Europe|Guru Larry]] did several years before with "Games Yanks Can't Wank" for ScrewAttack (who has also since fucked off to TGWTG). The title of his segment also contains a [[Fail|huge, glaring grammatical error]] that he's never bothered to fix, most likely because his viewers [[Idiots|don't know proper English either]] and have never pointed it out. Most people know him as having once upon a time produced a mildly amusing video about a [[rape]]-oriented videogame -- and never having produced anything remotely worthwhile before or since. Obviously he grabbed That Chick With The Goggles's position as the company's affirmative action hire, once she went off and got a real job, and so in spite of uploading videos only once in a blue moon he is framed as a mid-to-high-echelon contributor. All said, he produces fail after fail, so yes, he fits perfectly to the site.

He also lieks [[Metal]], performing strip teases, and giving blowjobs to Spoony.{{clear}}

=== Clan of the Gray Wolf ===

[[File:Roocotgw.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Roo. The soon to be successor of AVGN.]]

Hosted by '''Roo''', [http://www.clanofthegraywolf.com/ Clan of the Gray Wolf] is yet another gaming review site with a Youtube partnership. However it may surprise you that the content here is a step up from the basic TGWTG shit. Roo ignores the trend of shitty angry reviewers and does very in depth researched discussions about different video games and movies. His friend Boomer talks in depth about tabletop games without having to do hour long unboxing videos like Spoony. Still Roo has been known in the past to always jerk off to TGWTG and go as far as supporting dog shit like Kickassia. Roo even managed to raise over $1,500 for Child's Play, but never got honored as a sponsor unlike TGWTG butt buddy, Pat the NES Punk. Sorry, but you're gonna have to try harder than that. At least he didn't shit talk his fans over Skype and hang up on them.

<s> Yet for some strange reason this is not good enough for Doug and crew.</s> At Last he's been picked up for Blistered Thumbs. Angry Joe, now milking Roo's older videos for BT ad revenue, dumped on his lap bitch errands such as cover [http://magfest.org/ worthless events] while everyone else dicks around with their press passes to not get any real work done. Roo views this as an opportunity to spread his integrity across the fail (i.e., Blistered Thumbs), but Angry Joe has already stomped out any honor [[Nothing|their site had left.]] We're expecting a Brad Jones-esque decline into absolutely mediocre content punctuated with pointless crossovers.

=== Coldguy ===

[[Image:Coldguytgwtg.jpg|thumb|left|Coldguy]]

'''Coldguy''' AKA '''Patrick Burden''' was one of the reviewers at TGWTG who was better known for writing more articles than posting pointless videos. You might remember him from his cameo in Spoony's Warrior #1 review. Most of the time he would tell aspie stories of being a Game Stop employee. The three videos he made consist of foreign films that aren't the least bit nostalgic to the sites actual demographic. The only thing this guy could ever bring to the table is a circle jerk podcast about the site in general. Coldguy has been considered inactive from TGWTG since April 2010 (outside his shitty podcast) until he was appointed as a review editor on Blistered Thumbs new website.

[[Image:8bitmickey.jpg|thumb|right|8-Bit Mickey whoring himself out for the worst job in the video game industry. (BTW... MY EYEEEEESSS!!!!]]

'''Handsome Tom''' (Real Name '''Thomas Hanley Jr.''') use to be part of the famous duo with Stuttering Craig that was [[ScrewAttack.com]]. Tom and his friend Craig were both very passionate about the video game industry and wanted to make a site where they could get their messages out to the people. However Craig was very stingy about money with his cash cow the [[AVGN | AVGN]] along with the brand name of his site (which he stole from Nintendo). After many disagreements both parted ways and Tom decided to create his own site called [http://www.thegameheroes.com/ The Game Heroes]. Along with his pal '''8-Bit Mickey''' (Real Name '''Mickey Paradis''') they have mustered together a ScrewAttack Lite that nobody honestly cares about.

(The following section is presumably written by Handsome Tom himself, but this is purely speculation... although it would make him epic if it was):
With Blistered Thumbs having their own site Handsome Tom wasn't even considered to lead the charge in order to not constantly pander their retarded audience and earn some actual respect amongst gamers. Tom was after all the brains behind ScrewAttack before getting royally fucked over by Craig. In the past fans have seen how Tom puts more effort and research into his actual job than his giggling group of pussy repellent. Doug and Mike ignored this to award Angry Joe as the head of command. This is the equivalent of getting raped by a boxcar full of circus freaks, having the special education freak boxcar get sloppy seconds, and then an angry spic shits on your worn out carcass as he talks about the Kinect in front of a green screen. Handsome Tom was last seen on the set of Kickassia questioning his very existence on Earth to be stuck with absolute losers while he [[Colonel_Quaritch_does_not_give_a_fuck |gave no fucks]] about his entire performance.

8-Bit Mickey also shoehorned his way onto Season 2 for the Sony reality show called [http://www.thetester.com/ The Tester]. This show consists of retards with no actual art, programing, design, writing, sound or video editing, and producing experience while giving them challenges that would not even be suitable for a real tester job. Thanks to the number of TGWTG supporters 8-Bit Mickey managed to easily claim a spot on the show. We'd like to give thanks to you guys for giving us something to point and laugh at for all of the [[Retards | wrong reasons.]] He was eliminated in the 4th episode for being a stupid retard and making his team get lost during their challenge. Now you'll live forever in shame that you couldn't get farther to earning a terrible job than an obese retard or a gay gamer.

[[Image:Two Face Batman Animated.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Guru Larry by night on ED]]
[[Image:Naturalbornkitties.png|thumb|right|200px|From Bungie's Oni to this webcomic.]]

'''Guru Larry''' (Real Name '''Larry Bundy Jr.''', Known aliases of [[User:TheCuriousOrange]], [[User:UncleBastard]], [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Step_4&diff=1998660124&oldid=1998659779 and more]) was a failed artist and TV presenter in the video game industry and used to be a shitty fat fuck of a contributor for [[ScrewAttack]]. Before Stuttering "Popped Collar" Craig gave him the official boot after Larry publicly bitched and moaned about his ScrewAttack Europe forum being merged with another, and also because he treats all his friends and/or co-workers like shit by writing ED articles about them while making sure his own section wasn't written for several years. One was finally written, and [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=That_Guy_With_The_Glasses&diff=1998640147&oldid=1998639400 Guru Larry wants your sympathy so here is a link to the Guru Larry-approved version of this section. bawwwwwwwww sad face ScrewAttack done did him wrong awwwwww.] Craig felt pity for the two-faced gremlin, so he let The Curious Orange Uncle Bastard Larry create videos where Larry poorly informed people such facts as [[Common_knowledge | Super Mario Brothers 2 was actually Doki Doki Panic.]]

For the three years Guru Larry contributed there he using the name ScrewAttackEurope since he self-proclaimed himself the official limey spokesman for the site. However, Craig thought otherwise, seeing as how he sort of owned the site and Larry owned a blow-up doll, and Craig made him drop it (and the blow-up doll) to stop further dragging down the already tarnished ScrewAttack name. Craig and his cast of forgettable McJobbing teenage employees decided to host a [[butthurt]] powwow and talk about this situation along with the [[Haters_Gonna_Hate | haters.]] Craig later posted a second video apologising after his man-servant, Destin decided to [[Dox]] Larry's conversations with them in a blog.  Thankfully for Larry and unfortunately for ThatGuyWithTheGlasses, he has found a home with the other failure battered ex-ScrewAttack retards at TGWTG along with his friend Ashens, all of which he insults on a daily basis on Encyclopedia Dramatica under his well-hidden pseudonyms. And he would've gotten away with it, too, if he didn't gloat on his favorite forums about the ED articles on [[Chris-Chan]] and [[Video Game Reviewers]], the two articles ex-fat fuck specializes in.

The vast majority of Larry's video game collection was also destroyed due to his stupid negligence. To make some spare room in his house Larry thought it would be a good idea to put his collection inside an [[stupid|old rusty, leaking shed]]. Larry made a video for the aftermath of a rainstorm that ruined his collection while begging people for donations.

Nowadays, Larry makes fun of members on TGWTG by expanding their ED sections on this article under the pseudonyum [[User:TheCuriousOrange]] and previously as [[User:UncleBastard]]. Larry is lol-worthy of his own article, but has successfully kept it under wraps for years because he will get an ED editor that does things for the lulz banned by lying to banhammer carriers. U mad Larry? He mad. 

The following masturbatory quote was formerly in this very article, as it was written by the attention-starved Guru Larry that became such a fatass in the first place because he ate the souls of all the reviewers he secretly hates. Which is all of them. If you stop reading at just the right moment, you can find the split-second where he blasted his sterile jizz all over his monitor.

{{quote|But in all fairness, as much as he enjoys surrounding himself in the circle-jerk that is TGWTG, '''he has totally redeemed himself in the eyes of the [[ED]] community''' by being one of the only men alive to endure [[Chris-chan/Videos#Interview_with_Guru_Larry|an hour long video interview with Chris-chan]] thus ensuing he's fully capable of epic trolling lulz for our benefit.|Guru Larry talking utter bullshit as [[User:TheCuriousOrange]]}}

Larry is also a furfag as seen by his short lived webcomic [http://www.naturalbornkittens.com/ Natural Born Kittens.]

Thankfully for this prick Angry Joe was looking to fill in that gap of more worthless content. So he brought to this site his series called Weird Video Games. Here he discusses games that are far too weird and go beyond the norm compared to most video games out there. Yet for some reason extremely popular and inspired titles like Altered Beast, Puyo Puyo, and Captain Commando made this list as apposed to Cho Aniki, Boong Ga Boong Ga, Toilet Kids, or Gekisha Boy. Clearly his taste in games has no actual reflection on the medium itself and shows his basic knowledge is very limited.

[[File:Jewigi.jpg|thumb|left|JewWario,<br/>AKA Justin Carmical.<br><br>Why JewWario,  when [[Weegee|Jewigi]] would have been a much better name?]]
[[File:jew_wario_badge_of_honor.jpg|thumb|right|For just $5 you can literally wear your shame on your sleeves.]]

Wait... HE WILLINGLY CHOOSE TO BECOME A JEW?!  

JewWario is a typical [[Wapanese|weeaboo]] asstard straight from the bowels of Jewtube who only does reviews of games too shitty to be released outside Japan. Though [[You|some people]] would originally want to give him a pass considering he wasn't [[trying too hard]] to be funny at first, and he did not seem to suffer from a chronic case of [[USI|Unwarranted Self-Importance]] like so many of his co-workers. However, like a good contributor he has managed to fit in with the rest of the flock by introducing zany [[unfunny|sketches]] into many his reviews, [[circle-jerk|cameos]] of fellow contributors whenever possible, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76s5SR8Y11o/ and sucking copious amounts of dick] to let everyone know how tight he is with the group. You can tell how much of a faggot he is just by looking at the titles of the games he reviews. He is on the site because Doug figured one soul-degrading weeaboo on the site wasn't enough, and wants him to get up in MarzGurl's chunky ass. If his Japanophile status wasn't creepy enough JewWario is also the oldest member on TGWTG pushing age 40, which is masked well with his [[Aspie|mannerisms]] and [[13 year old boy|fashion sense]] allowing him to [[Teenager|seem far, far younger than he actually is]], though sadly not in a way that is flattering.

=== Lee Is Still Gaming ===
[[Image:SashaNeinbiggar.jpg|thumb|left|SashaNein / StillGaming]]
'''Lee Davidge,''' better known as SashaNein, ''(Also known as "Still Gaming" (pronounced "Still [[gay]], man"))'' initially appears to to a sensible, rational human being, with well thought out video game reviews and agreeable points on mid-80's to early-90's technology, but instead turns out to be a complete and utter fucking nut-job wacko.

He suffers from a severe case of hypochondria, in his case a crippling stomach pain which makes him incapable of making reviews for months at a time, but bizarrely also allows him to make countless "vlogs" describing his symptoms constantly to gain [[emo|sympathy votes]].

When Lee is not making videos about his stomach illness, he enjoys [[fag|taking it up the ass]] from [http://www.youtube.com/user/PBCProductions PBC Productions], [http://www.youtube.com/user/InecomCompany Classic Game Room] and That Guy With The Glasses as he can never get through one fucking video or paragraph without sucking up to them at least twice. ''(though being their bitch may actually explain his constant stomach pains)''.

Lee also is the only person on [[YouTube]] to suffer from pretend [[Stephen Hawking|Lou Gehrig's disease]], as he has never appeared moving on screen, he's only seen in a collection of awkward poses to slightly lessen the monotony of his rants.

Lee has, on rare occasions, shown the potential to be a good source of [[e-drama]] as he becomes agitated and defensive quite easily. Whether it's fending off criticism of his derivative and mediocre work, or [[pussy-whipped|standing up for]] his whale of a [[Slut|fiance]] Dena after revealing herself to be a [[furry]]. These events did not nearly create as much [[lulz]] as they could have due to his show being of such [[TOW|little noteworthiness]] at the time they simply flew under the radar.

'''Jason Pullera''',  better known as LordKaT ''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtA43PYo1R0 (moar liek LordFAT amirite?)]'' is yet another addition to the talentless hacks that are the Blistered Thumbs circle-jerk.  

TGWTGtards praise him for his superior gaming skills on hard NES and Genesis games when all he does is play on emulators and use save states ad-nauseum to beat them. As if that wasn't easy enough, he also resorts to cheating, as seen for example [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/bt/lk/uww/26518-alien-soldier here] (notice the health stopping at 1 HP later in the video). This is something a blind thalidomide chimpanzee with downs syndrome could achieve [[Irony| given enough time and persistence]].  

When not pretending to be good at difficult vidya games, Jason [[mod]]erates [[711chan]] and enjoys playing up to the stereotypes of either being a [[Guido|WOP]] or a fatass by eating any old piece of shit within the vicinity of his chubby arms, whether it be duck foetuses or bull cocks (no, we didn't miss a "LordKat loves eating cock" joke, [[Lie|we're above such infantile humor]]). Jason has also officially jumped on the cliché bandwagon that everyone else on the site has of consuming any old shit [[unfunny|"for teh lulz"]] ''(read:  to make moar monies on Blip)''.  His sister is just Jason in drag.  

Unlike some of his other butthurt TGWTG brethren, however, Jason couldn't give a fuck about any negativity or criticism given towards him on the internets, thus making him a pretty hard target for EDing.  ''(Though it'll be fun trying!)'' It's all caught up with him: [http://www.lordkat.com/minor-fame-major-stress.html]

Previously embroiled in some faggy drama with Escapist Magazine about Madden 11.[[Shit nobody cares about|Where he insulted some reviewer on the magazine for saying how good Madden 11 or some bullshit like that]] .You can find this drama on his Twitter page , he's up early floggin' this one. LordKat seems to be taking the SpoonyOne's approach to this situation by acting like a complete spaz.  

He had some sort of blood boil on his inner thigh [[Period|burst]] due to constrictive undies.  Y'know, 'cause he's such an athletic fellow.

Why is a no talent hack like you on ThatGuyWithTheGlasses?"|LordKaT, talking about himself.<br>Quoted for truth.}}

Recently Jason actually grew something resembling balls, and went out of his way to [http://lordkat.blip.tv/file/4434617/ criticize] "some producers" on Channel Awesome *Cough*his fellow fatass Sean*Cough* for pathetically begging for donations, by saying that he "didn't approve of it" and "don't want to be associated with it". [[Pussy troll|Despite only putting out some very washed out criticism and flimsily trying to avoid mentioning any names in the video, and making further attempts to sugarcoat it by saying that he "is cool with Channel Awesome" as a whole]], expect Sean to throw a temper tantrum (and (hopefully) get another heart attack), and Mr. Baldie to either brutally whip Jason into following the [[Republicans|party line]] and issuing an official apology, or outright excommunicate him from the site.

It seems as after that episode Sean used crocodile tears for his fans on his Twitter account and is back to his old ways, but nobody on TGWTG is wanting to kick Jason out. So now Jason decides to venture out into the lion's den of the TGWTG critics and [http://thebusystreet.com/2010/12/20/lordkat-tells-us-the-truth/ revealed even more awful things about his co-workers.] Jason won't take any more shit from a bunch of Cubs fans back at home base and will fuck them over if necessary.

Most of the time he likes to [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sS3ivhTQvA make shitty vLogs] as he's playing a random video game about personal events or future videos.

===Zeitgeist Game Review===

[[File:ZeitgeistGameReview.jpg|thumb|left|Zeitgeist Game Review]]
[[File:zeitgiest_dressup.jpg|thumb|right|Daniel is a perfect fit for the site.]]

With BT's new website starting up, they've managed to pull in a <s>[[lie|popular Youtube reviewer]] to do their dirty work.</s> ''Correction, he's one of Angry Joe's fuck buddies from the [[YouTube|YouTube Partner]] "holier than thou" circle-Jerk that is [[Video Game Reviewers|The Game Station]].''  

'''Zeitgeist''' (Real Name: '''Daniel Williams''') loves to portray himself as a "lovable nice guy", but as you can see in [http://wolfsgamingblog.com/2010/08/25/zeitgeist-gets-grilled-interview-time/ this interview], he comes across as an arrogant, self-centered prick, who has the same level of video game knowledge as the [[Irate Gamer]], often simply phoning in his reviews with obvious comments with little research nor effort.

In other words Zeitgeist is a [[Blistered Thumbs|dime-a-dozen reviewer]], whose bland, forgetful, uninspiring (and some what unappealing) videos bring absolutely zero to the table, and if it wasn't for his enjoyment of tasting male Spic cooch and sucking the cocks of YouTube partner communities, he wouldn't even appear as a blip on the radar.  But kudos to Angry Joe for instantly degrading his new website by pulling in such a talentless fucktard as Daniel.

It should also be noted, that Mr.Williams is a complete sellout and seems to give almost nothing but highly positive reviews, even if the game is bugfested or shitty as hell. Any negativity from him will usually only be brief mentions of things he just [[Pussy|"personally didn't like"]] about the game. Whether this is intentional or due to him doing little to no research on the game he praises is anyone's guess. The bigger the company behind the game, the more praise the game receives, and considering there have been several videos where he has mentioned the company themselves sending a copy of the game for him to review then it's [[Whore|no wonder]] as to why he sugarcoats nearly every game he "reviews".

'''''REASON FOR DEPARTURE:'''  Fired for being a lying nut job wacko.''

'''Dan Rizzo''', a former game reviewer from [[Australia]] that reviewed crappy games and crappy movies about his homeland, who can't keep his mouth shut for five seconds unless he's spewing some sort of total [[bullshit]] from his fat wallaby fucking ass. After hearing about his feud with Spoony, TGWTG admins eventually decided to permaban him from the site, which caused an uproar with fans curious about their Aussie's sudden departure. Thus far, TGWTG's staff has not spoken out, leading to wild rumors and extended drama. [[Some argue|It is speculated]] ThatAussieGuy got fired because of his lack of updates and just being a preening faggot, but seeing TGWTG [[fanboys]] have about as much rationality as a schizophrenic, this probably holds about as much weight as a starving Ethiopian. It's becoming even more obvious as of late. It is well known around the [[internets]] that ThatAussieGuy is the Angry Videogame Nerd's and Nostalgia Critic's deformed lovechild.

When TGWTG was in their early stages Rizzo was a control monger on the site. Any content he didn't personally approve of no matter what Doug and crew liked was deleted. He went as far as deleting videos by his fellow contributors that were posted on the site and any record of their existence. He would even delete posts by said contributors when they would ask where the videos went. Mike Michaud tracked these actions back to Rizzo from his ip address. When cornered by Mike about said acts he [[Bullshit | made up a story]] where his neighbor hacked into his internet account to delete the same contributors videos/posts constantly.

For a period of time he also hosted a [[shit|shitty]] website about an Australian variety [[TV|program]], which was made of his tears and fail. However, when [[Anonymous|certain individuals]] started [[trolling]] him, in an attempt to be an [[internet tough guy]] he threatened to [[an hero]] and deleted said website in a fit of fat-boy rage. On his [http://rizraves.blogspot.com/ back-up site] he proclaims that he has many sponsors and posts fail-inducing videos of himself ranting and raving like a 12 year old boy. Same goes for his [http://www.youtube.com/user/RizRaveReviews Youtube] account. He [[bawww|bawwws]] when he loses a subscriber, and posts videos to express his [[fail|anger]].

Despite the fact that her reviews could cure the worst cases of insomnia, she somehow commanded a small, cult following on the website.

'''Addendum:''' Since receiving the DS she only managed to do 2 DS game reviews before quitting the internet forever at the very end of 2009. She has only done 3 videos in 2010 before PBC finally called it quits and none of them include reviews for the DS or GB Color. 

Also, a little bird tells us that even though she asked for donations all the time, she made plenty of money from ad revenue on her Blip and Youtube partner account. Ultimately, her entire review show was a gigantic scam. A poorly executed one at that.

'''''REASON FOR REJECTION:''' A living heavily breathing clone of TGWTG contributors.''

Judging from his wardrobe and personal appearance alone he's rip for the picking to be on TGWTG. He even makes a Dr. Insano clone called Professor Anarchy. Plus he made a The Room movie review a couple of months after it was taken down on TGWTG. So why the fuck would you turn this guy down, Doug? Well he reviews movies in an even shitter fashion than the current staff. In fact his reviews don't even go past the 20 minute mark like most others because who wants to get right to the point with a review when we want a full summary clip show? Sorry tubby, but you're gonna have try harder than this.

I wish I was making this shit up. This thing actually exists. So how would someone come up with this type of show? Does someone online in Yahoo Answers go:

"You know I'm a fan of TGWTG, but don't have time to watch everything they do each week. Could some brave souls out there make a summary of this shit for me so I won't have to check them out? I don't care if there is a fourm, podcast, or live steaming videos with the existing members of TGWTG. Also your visual effects don't have to be great. Worse than public access is acceptable. Thanks."

Yes that is the target audience for this fucking travesty of a show.

Kickassia is the TGWTG's site [[pathetic|attempt]] at [[attention whore|celebrating its two year (jesus fucking christ, two years?) anniversary]]. It is exemplary of all the [[fail]] the website has to offer. So what is it? Strangely enough, it has nothing to do with reviewing [[shit no one cares about]]. It is instead [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/21882-kickassia-part-01 a] [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/21951-kickassia-part-02-triumph-and-treacle 6] [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/22008-kickassia-part-03-inglorious-glory part] [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/22074-kickassia-part-04-the-beginning-of-the-end video] [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/22132-kickassia-part-05-the-fall-of-the-risen event] [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/22200-kickassia-part-06-all-the-really-bad-shit-happens that] miserably attempts to be funny by doing a [[The cancer that is killing /b/|GIANT COLLABORATION VIDEO WITH. EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKER. WHO HAS EVER APPEARED ON THE SITE.]] (except Dr. Ashens, as non-faggots were not invited). The entire thing is [[camwhore|written by, directed by, and starring]] the god himself, Doug Walker. Ironically, when Doug later reviewed ''The Room'', he remarked on how the same guy was writer, director, and star, saying, "Warning, people!")

Every single episode of Kickassia is a [[Uncyclopedia|plodding, unfunny]] car crash of an internet "movie", based around a miserable grind of [[Family Guy|poorly written and poorly timed jokes]]. It succeeds only by showing everything that is wrong with [[Pain Series|Channel Awesome]] and how much of a talentless hack everyone is. No one in the entire video ever attempts to act but instead show what sad miserable fucks they're all truly are. A small example of this shit would be the Nostalgia Chick pretending to be [[Sarah Palin]], forgetting she is about 2 years behind on the joke. Every other [[blowjob|gag]] and, uh, [[lol|plot element]] consists of [[OVER 9000|inside jokes and references that have already been used dozens of times in regular reviews]].

Clearly this was [[Starcraft 2|an epic that could only be told in six instalments]] (to make them moar monies on Blip).

One thing you can be sure of, though; just as night follows day, this "[[retard|special event]]" is followed by unbearable commentary and [[slashfic|crossover]] videos.  At this point, TGWTG is like some kind of hideous, buck-toothed hydra that spawns ten new, awful videos each time a new awful video is uploaded.

Take [http://spoonyexperiment.com/2010/05/22/doug-crew-play-dance-maniax-jparadise DOUG & CREW PLAY DANCE MANIAX JPARADISE!!], for example, which is described as

[http://spoonyexperiment.com/ Spoony.]}}

As far as "White Guy Movements" are concerned, this one's a little less funny than the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  Besides, Benzaie's not white, he's French.

But, considering all the shitty movies these [[Irate Gamer|talentless fucker]]s "review" on the site,  it would be highly ironic if one of them actually covered Kickassia.  But don't hold your breath though, these faggots would rather slit their own throats than get their graven idol, Doug Walker [[butthurt]].

== How to effectively troll That Guy With The Glasses (Kickassia Edition) ==

Of course, trolling TGWTG fanboys is like shooting fish in a barrel, but if you'd like to be extra evil this year and rub salt in the wound,  you could try one (or several) of the following...

* Say that Kickassia was really not that good -'' No seriously!'' You do not even have to say that it was pretty bad or fucking sucked. Merely implying that it is anything below absolute perfection is enough to cause butthurt. For guys who's claim to fame is ripping on bad movies, they got extremely frail nerves.
* Complain about Spoony not having a big enough role in Kickassia, despite the fact he got second most screentime.
* Bitch why the AVGN wasn't in it "properly" this year, then go off on a tangent about they would have been better off hiring the Irate Gamer for a cameo.
* Point out it would have been far funnier if Mike J, Dr. Ashens, Guru Larry, Wez, HopeWithinChaos (Ha ha, just kidding. HopeWithinChaos sucks) or That Chick with the Goggles were in it, then constantly ask why they insisted on inviting the unfunny, characterless members on-screen instead.
* Tell everyone that Film Brain was by far the best actor in Kickassia.
* Remark "where was Dan Rizzo? It's not the same without him...".
* Tell the forums that you're putting your DVD of the movie on Bit Torrent as soon as you get it, so they won't have the money to make any more come the 3rd anniversary.
* Say that, "Tommy Wiseau's, The Room, is better then Doug Walker's, Shitassia movie." 100% Butthurtia guaranteed.
* Bitch that, "Alexander4488 should have been in Kickassia."

[[File:Doug-walker.png|thumb|center|400px|Doug's reaction when finding out most people are (now) actually torrent his shitty DVD movie, sorry, I mean a DVD video of losers screaming and acting like barking lunatics that should really be in the insane asylum instead of making peanuts from their bliptv ads, which should be blocked with "AdBlock" (just a tip there).]]

= The Nostalgia Critic vs. Tommy Wiseau =

[[File:Tommy Wiseau.jpg|thumb|left|Tommy Wiseau,<br><br>An innocent actor/director,<br>harassed and bullied by Doug<br>and his TGWTG fantards.]]

[[Image:ncvswiseaumaturity.jpg|thumb|A standard retort against Wiseau Films made by the average NC fan.]]
::'''''BREAKING NEWS''': The prolonged harassment campaign against Tommy from Douglas' fantards has succeeded. The Room review was put up again in December 2010.''
Sometime on a Tuesday in July, the [[Truth|Lultastic Avenger]] strikes again. A while ago, maybe on a Sunday, the Nostalgia Critic's [[fail|award-winning masterpiece]] review of [[Shit nobody cares about|The Room]] was taken down from the site due to threats of a lawsuit from [[fag|John from TheRoomMovie.com]] due to copyright infringement. ([[Shemale|Obscura Lupa]]'s video was also taken down, but who gives a fuck about "her"?.) In [[BAWW|retaliation]], the Nostalgia Critic's [[Shit nobody cares about|latest masterpiece]] has him pretending to be [[Chris-chan|Tommy Wiseau]], some French faggot who directed [[Shit nobody cares about|The Room]]. He [[BAWW|totally supports his innocence]] by trying to be lulzy ala blasting Wiseau and John, and ultimately proves to be as funny as [[Fag|Carlos Mencia]]. Upon hearing their mighty hero's ego wounded and eager to suck cock, the [[fantard|fanboys]] were called to battle, <s>brandishing the Internets to battle the evildoers who wronged [[Jesus|Their Lord]] by writing [[BAWW|angry letters]]</s> Apparently, the email link was taken down on the site because of the mass flood of butthurt from [[Carlos Mencia|The Nostalgia Critic's]] fanboys. But alas, [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody gave a flying fuck.]] The butthurt [[fantard|fantards]] also tried to write about this event on Wikipedia, but their stories have been removed by the admins. [[BAWW|CRY SUMMOAR.]] What should be noted is that Michaud isn't saying anything to the Critic about how [[butthurt|butthurt]] he is coming off as, nor is he telling his chosen [[manchild|manchild]] that he might be potentially [[an hero|killing Channel Awesome]] for some reason that, surely, will promote much [[lulz|lulz]] if Doug's butthurt actions continue.  Expect more lulz to follow as we follow this [[lulz|story]].

{{quote|Oh hi, John from The Room Movie Dot Com.
How are you doing? Probably angry because of all the hate-mail you're getting.
I have the solution!
Your movie would make much more money if the review was still up, because in the end of it, the Nostalgia Critic tells the viewers to actually watch the movie! You'd get much more people at the screenings that way.
I highly recommend that you allow the Nostalgia Critic to keep his review, or you will pay.. You will pay.|

The following letter was edited to make it shorter and more readable because [[butthurt|the fanboy who wrote it was extremely butthurt]]

{{quote|I am just writing today to express my disappointment in the fact that you guys have decided to try to sue a person
who has MUCH more talent than the egotistical director of the cult "classic" The Room, The Nostalgia Critic.
It seems you have done this with no knowledge of Fair Use and how it pertains to reviews of movies, and despite the fact
that though he criticised the movie (deservedly so as it's the ultimate definition of ego-maniacal vanity project, and a waste of $7 million dollars)
he recommended it be seen by all of his viewers.
...The Critic gave you free publicity...
He has not financially harmed you, quite the opposite in fact as several people have stated they have purchased the movie purely to show it to their friends who cannot
believe a film so bad exists. In short John, you are a fool. Mr Wiseau is a fool (as if that weren't apparent already by his awful movie that serves only to massage a MASSIVELY inflated ego). 
And you have done far greater harm to your image than any reviewer ever could. Before Mr Wiseau had an aura of the Ed Wood about him - he's terrible, but he has a kind of weird charisma that
got you past that fact - now I'm afraid he and you must go down as arrogant, childish, spiteful and utterly pathetic in your cynical idiocy.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to toss around a football in my best tuxedo for absolutely no reason....I HATE THIS WOOORLD!!|
Apparently he is a fool}}

{{quote|I think your parents were either inbred or you got dropped on your head as an infant to not only act in (horribly I might add), direct and write such an atrocious movie as "The Room", but to claim copyright infringement on a satirical review. Not only was the review funny, it is also protected by the same laws that you claimed it violated. The only reason it got deleted was because the administrators of the site probably didn't know enough about copyright law.

Now that I think of it I should probably have you sued for bodily damage (I almost needed eye surgery) and mental anguish due to watching "The Room".

You sir, are a total and utter fuck-up and the internet will always prevail. That I can guarantee you.|

{{quote|"Oh, hi! John from the room movie dot com.

How's it going? Probably not that great right now because of all the angry emails about the Nostalgia Critic's review of "the room" being taken down because you guys claimed copyright infringement. Well, I'm here to help! Firstly, you should know that he (the Nostalgia Critic) does not need to ask for your permission, nor does he need to pay you any sort of fees, because he reviewed your movie. It's covered under fair use, which I quote here:
"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for "fair use" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing. Non-profit, educational or personal use tips the balance in favor of fair use."
This means that he does not need any legal or moral clearance from you in order to review "The Room." Now, to resolve all of this hate mail I'm sure you're getting, you are truly better off not lodging any copyright claims against him, because, if this were to go to court, you would most surely loose any legal battle, not to mention money. But that aside, letting him keep the review up is actually good business for YOU! Yes, it is! For, you see, he actually tells people to go watch the movie! This is what you would call a free advertisement! Now, you can do what you want, but the Nostalgia Critic is most likely going to dispute your copyright claims, in which case you will loose, according to the "fair use" clause I provided you above.|
How cute, the [[fanboy|fantard]] thinks it's a lawyer!}}

But if these are [[boring|tl;dr]], here is a short version:

{{quote|SO BUTTHURT}}

Fans are still [[butthurt|butthurt]] about Tommy Wiseau to the extent that they are STILL bitching about how much he sux [[over 9000|a whole week]] after their [[retard|Messiah]] made [[butthurt|"The Tommy Wiseau Show"]]. However, some fans actually possess a brain and are telling their [[fag|butthurt compatriots]] to [[lulz|shut the fuck up]], as seen here:

{{quote|Yay, so let's all spam the shit out of their contact email and act like a total retards because that's what true NC fans do! 
No.

I don't really see the point of being so butthurt because one NC episode was taken down. Seriously. This goes to you too, Doug. You're just embarrasing yourself, not Wiseau.|
Assiman, who needs a medal}}

Seriously, if a whole fanbase is still [[butthurt|butthurt]] over something that should have been kept private, seeing as it is a [[srs bsns|lawlsuit]] we're talking about here, then it only proves that The Nostalgia Critic is a [[BAWW|butthurt crybaby]]. But just in case you think you're missing out on [[LOL WUT|some new renaissance]] being held down by [[The Man]], we here at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] took up the battle for [[free speech]] and suffered many casualties to get these videos back to the oppressed people... by which we mean we did a simple [[YouTube]] search. Way to stick it to [[The Man]], Douglas! Seriously, if it could be found on [[Youtube]], is it really something to [[butthurt|cry about]]? No. Congratulations, Doug! You are officially a [[lolcow|lolcow]].

Fans and contributors of Channel Awesome expected that Wiseau would quickly crumble under the barrage of weaponized [[butthurt]] being launched at him, in the form of numerous parody videos, crybaby e-mails, and [[forced meme|forced memes based on Tommy Wiseau]]. In spite of all this, however, Wiseau has not changed his position in any way, his only apparent action having been to remove his e-mail address from the movie's web site, proving to bewildered Channel Awesome fanboys that [[USI]] is just that and is in fact devoid of any [[IRL|real-world]] [[jewgold|currency]].  And so ironically, although the intent of all the parodies of Tommy Wiseau was to depict him as overly [[butthurt]] over a little copyright infringement, Wiseau's intransigence has caused that intent to completely backfire.

After months of fans whining over content that was always readily available on YouTube minutes after being taken down, Channel Awesome decided to call Wiseau's bluff and reposted [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/25743-the-room both] [http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/ol/olp/23496-the-room videos] on the site proper. Nothing to see here, never fucking mind.
