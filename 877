Battlecry

[[Image:Battlecry2.jpg|right|thumb|Battlecry's 2 members, seen here in their studio.]]

'''Battlecry''' is a [[shit]] band from [[New York]] who only sing songs about WHITE POWER. They have the style of an 80s Garage Band, and will most likely become [[An_Hero|an heroes]] because of shit sales (assuming they lose their Ipods first).

As seen on the right, the homosexual, pure-bred whitey is wearing an Everlast shirt, but is indeed scared to step foot in a boxing ring because of "OMG NIGRA SUPER-STRENGTH POWERS THAT'S CHEATING", aka, scared of [[teh]] [[nigra]]s.

"''Battlecry was formed by Richard and myself in response to what we saw as a lack of Heavy Metal representation in the music of the [[racist|Pro White]] movement. Over the span of 20 years we have played extensively in many bands, even operating a commercial recording studio for some time. We hope those of you who purchase the Battlecry CD enjoy the direction we are taking in spreading out [[KKK|Pro White]] message. And we hope you in turn continue to spread this message, for together we are [[fag|strong]].''"

This is one of Battlecry's [[FAIL]] rock ballads, which even has a completely homosexual video to go along with it ([http://www.nationalistpartyusa.org/battlecry2.wmv WMV]) ([http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4282467109086186412 GOOGLEVIDEO]). This song is about [[racism|white pride]] and [[anal sex|triumph]].

Here is [http://www.battlecrymusic.com/Music/track08.mp3 the MP3] if you are [[retarded|blind]].

The author of this article cannot stop [[masturbation|rocking out]] long enough to write down the lyrics. Also, he cannot actually read due to decades of "pure white only" inbreeding.

== Keepers of the Light ==

Battlecry is currently collaborating with [[Prussian Blue]], another shit band. While their song, "Keepers of the Light", has not been released yet, it is expected to be a top seller in the [[racist|Pro White]][[Nazi]] scene. This was announced in [[last Thursday|February]], but nothing has really popped up yet. This is mostly due to not being able to find record labels who wanted to lose money.
