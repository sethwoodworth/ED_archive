[[File:Strutting leo.jpg|thumb|200px|The original [[exploitable]] Strutting Leo.]]
'''Strutting Leo''' is the newest “exploitable” [[meme]] to have cropped up from the likes of [[4chan]] and [[Fark]]’s [[photoshop]] contests.  The image is taken from a screen capture in the [[2010]] movie "Shutter Island" and it depicts a very happy [[Retard|Leonardo DiCaprio]] as he struts himself through any number of [[Drama|dire]], [[funny]], disasterous, or [[LOL WUT|inane]] circumstances.  Of course, this sort of thing is lapped up like candy-coated [[cocaine]] by [[newfags]] and [[Deviantart|“internet artists"]] and then shat back out as quickly as possible.  
==Use==


Just like [[Blockatiel]], [[Michael J. Fox]], the [[HA! HA! Guy]], and countless other [[Oh exploitable|photoshopable exploitables]], you can put Strutting Leo into just about everything, and you probably will!  

==Meme Predictions==

Meme prediction:  this will be played out by next week.  But that doesn’t mean you won’t be seeing Strutting Leo t-shirts, mouse pads, and coffee mugs for years to come.  It is a certainty that some Jew will come along and make the next [[I Can Has Cheezburger?]] out of this and then manage to parlay this terrible meme into a fortune.

Take a step with the right.

Tilt your head to the side.

Smile real, real wide.|[[Soulja Boy]]}}
