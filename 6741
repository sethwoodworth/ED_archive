R. Lee Ermey
[[File:R Lee Ermey.jpg|thumb|He will definitely fuck you up!]]
'''R. Lee Ermey''' is an [[80 year old Chinese man in panties|older gentleman]] made up of about 35% badassery, 39% [[win]], and 26% [[anger]]. Ermey has made a living out of taking [[Kurt Cobain|scroungy fucks]] who often aren't considered human beings, and whipping them into shape; it is understood that they will receive a skullfucking upon failure to complete a task. 

==[[IRL]] Tough Guy==
Ermey is an outspoken IRL Tough Guy, having served in the U.S. Marine Corps in [[NAM|Vietnam]] for 14 months of his life, where he roamed the jungles, screaming at and killing [[AZN]] guys and [[rape|raping]] their women. He then went to Japan, serving two tours of [[shit|duty]], unleashing his righteous fury on all the [[Jap|Japanese]] soldiers. This is accepted as [[FACT]], [[World War II|although the timing doesn't really add up]]. In the 1970s or something he was forcefully retired due to [[1guy1jar|injuries]] sustained during [[300|GLORIOUS BATTLE]].


==Illustrious Movie Career==
R. Lee Ermey has been in [[at least 100]] movies, and plays the same fucking character in all of them. This is [[Oh ok|okay]], as [[Hero|HE CAN DO NO WRONG]]. His roles include:
* '''Angry Yelling Army Guy''' in ''Full Metal Jacket''
* '''Angry Yelling Army Guy''' in ''The Boys in Company C''
* '''Angry Yelling Army Guy''' in ''Purple Hearts''
* '''Angry Yelling Army Guy's Voice''' in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''Toy Story'', and other ''[[Animu|Anime]] shit.

==He doesn't blink==
He can look into [[goatse|the eye of danger]] and not avert his gaze. [[Srsly]] though he does not blink. WATCH HIS EYES.

==Why he is better than [[you]]==

[[File:Badass guns.jpg|thumb|right|This is what waits for [[you]] if you deny any information in this section.]]
* [[Eat Da Poo Poo|However tall you are, they don't stack shit that high]].
* [[You]] are not even a human fucking being. You are nothing but an unorganized grabastic piece of amphibian shit.
* It does not matter if you lot are niggers, kikes, wops or greasers. Here you are all equally [[Truth|worthless]].
* [[old meme|You're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach-around]].
* You are the slimy little [[communist]] shit twinkletoe cocksucker who just signed his own death warrant.
* You had best square your ass away and start shitting him Tiffany cufflinks or he will definitely fuck you up!
* The best part of you ran down the crack of your mama's ass and ended up as a [[crap|brown stain]] on the mattress.
* You will give your rifle a girl's name because this is the only [[AIDS|pussy]] you people are going to get.
* Do you [[cock|suck dicks?]] (Obviously, [[yes]].)
* [[God]] Bless [[America]].
* He has your name, he has your ass.  You will not laugh, you will not cry, you will learn by the numbers, he will teach you.  You had best unfuck yourself...or...
* He will unscrew your head and shit down your neck.
* His videos are quotable.

[[File:British Asshole.jpg|thumb|left|[[PWNED]] via Ermey's WOOD.]]
Ermey has an extensive record of [[Epic Win|bashing the gay and Jewish communities]], striving for a better tomorrow through the power of [[HNG|old man rage]]. Because of his activism, he was challenged to an altercation by a young britfag whose parents moved him to America. Quote from young Nigel's blog:

{{quote|This old bigot is a detrement to society; i Swear I'm going to shoot him or somethin when he troks by Chicago.|[[britfag|Britfag]] of Chicago, apparently}}


On a tour for his involvement in the [[unfunny|comedy]] ''Saving Silverman'', sure enough, R. Lee Ermey stopped by Chicago in this asshole's neighborhood. The kipper-swallowing jizzfaced loser threw a rock at Ermey, who proceeded to whip out a fucking nightstick and [[Murder|MAKE HIM PAY]]. The Jews, however, didn't do anything (except post a blog) because [[Internet Tough Guy|they don't feel that it's right to meet violence with violence]]. Why did [[We|'Murika]] save them from the Nazis, Spanish, Turkish, Muslims, and all those other ethnic groups? It must somehow equal [[profit]].

==Selling Out for Car Insurance==
[[Your|Our]] hero one day turned [[over 9000]] years old, and [[Snob|decided that he wasn't filthy rich enough from acting to take his fortune to the afterlife with him]], so he went to Geico. Geico decided it would be [[what|funny]] to have him play the role of a therapist, using washed-out versions of his old insults; instead of calling somebody a stupid piss-powered ball polisher mongoloid and threatening to skullfuck them, they opted to have him call people crybabies and [[WTF|Jackwagons]]. [[Writing Yourself Into An Article|(I mean, it's not like they can have him drop the f-bomb every 5 seconds like in FMJ.)]]
