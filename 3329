Starring that Mexican with the large ass and that guy from Dazed and Confused, '''Gigli''' (pronounced ''ZHEE-lee'') is a [[Shitty|famous]] film. It received [[at least 100]] positive reviews from critics and is today considered [[Lie|one of the greatest films of all time]]. It includes a monologue about the merits of [[pussy]] and the phrase "Gooble, Gobble... It's turkey time," referring to [[cunnilingus]]. Two thumbs up!

The film is #3 of the list of best movies ever, after [http://images.google.com/images?q=vaginal%20surgery&oe=UTF-8&client=firefox&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi Citizen Kane] and [[X-Men|X-Men 3]]. Additionally, it was widely recognized for [[9/11|preventing 9-11]], inspiring the glamorous career of [[Mediacrat]], and generally [[rape|satisfying]] the starving [[cunts]] of Hollywood drama [http://www.qwipster.net/whore.jpg whores] everywhere. It contains a rare scene where a drugged-out looking Brad Renfro prophecies under the stars, who then begin to sing that song from American Tail, which totally explains why this is such an amazing film. 

If you do not have this film in your [[anus|netflix queue]], fucking [[God]] will probably [[Castration|knead your testes/labia into pizza dough.]]
