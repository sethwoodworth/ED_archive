Later, it is not clear when, Elisha placed cameras around the house to spy on Kevin and recorded him doing the same thing with other girls' pictures. During this time, Elisha had done nothing even though she had a young daughter from a previous marriage in the home.

At some point, her young daughter introduced them to a nine-year-old friend, who Kevin became obsessed with. On an outing, at which it began to rain, Kevin opened an umbrella, placed his arm around this little friend and walked off, leaving his family behind to get wet.
