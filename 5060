'''[http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm MIT OpenCourseWare]''' is [[MIT]]'s way of [[lol|giving back]]. Any fucktard with an internet connection can pretend that he or she goes to MIT!

It is basically MIT's version of [[WebMD]] with a [[University of Phoenix]] twist and the dash of pretentious [[douchebag|douchebaggery]] that comes along with anything related to MIT.


==Users==
[[image:Wow Nerd.jpg|thumb|The perfect place for [[you]]]]
The average user of OpenCourseWare is [[User:Pory|someone who couldn't get into college]], someone who got kicked out of college, or someone who goes to a shitty school full of [[Indian]] or [[Asian]] professors who don't speak [[English]].

==Courses of Study==
Pretty much anything can be learned by a single visit to OpenCourseWare. That is, of course, if you know the particular class number you want, are willing to scroll through lists of thousands of classes, or don't really give a fuck and think leaving the tab open makes you look [[smart]].

Some of the more [[popular|popular sections]] include:

*'''Editor's Picks''': Apparently, it is someone's job to sit around and choose their favorite documents. [[fact|This page has been updated approximately once]].

*'''Translated Courses''': This is the section that most [[weebs]] visit, as it offers courses in their [[moonspeak|favorite languages they love to pretend to speak]].

*'''Foreign Language and Literature''': This section is also a one stop shop for the [[wapanese]]. From here, one can find documents from classes about [[anime|Japanese popular culture]], [[manga|Japanese literature]] and cinema, and [[bullshit|race and gender in Asian countries]].

*'''Music and Theater Arts''': Because nothing says "[[Massachusetts]][[nerds| Institute of Technology]]" like [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/music-and-theater-arts/21m-670-traditions-in-american-concert-dance-gender-and-autobiography-spring-2008/ Traditions in American Concert Dance: Gender and Autobiography]!

*'''Aeronautics and Astronautics''': Judging by the title of this section, you can learn to be [[awesome|an astronaut]].

===WTF===
Probably the most confusing sections are the ones dedicated to:
*'''Experimental Study Groups''' (we don't know what this means either)
*'''[[sports|Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation]]'''
*'''[[women|Women's and Gender Studies]]''' ([[lol wut]])

==The Power of OpenCourseWare==
[[image:why.online.education.gif|thumb|You will also [[Global warming|save the planet]]]]
It has been proven that citing anything from MIT OpenCourseWare makes you automatically win an argument. This is, of course, [[lies|completely true]].

Perhaps the best part of OpenCourseWare is that it can make you feel better about the [[ITT Tech|shitty school you attended]] by allowing you to examine the incredibly pointless courses offered at MIT. Though this may also make you [[rage]] when you find out that, had you gone to MIT, you could have been breezing through classes like Feminist Theory, Bestsellers: Detective Fiction, and [[drugs|Drugs, Politics, and Fiction]].

=="What is MIT OCW?"==

Well, based on [http://ocw.mit.edu/about/ MIT OCW's official website], the focus should rather be on what MIT OCW is '''not'''. Here's a short list (copied from their site) of what appears to be common misconceptions: 

*OCW is not an MIT education.
*OCW does not grant degrees or certificates.
*OCW does not provide access to MIT faculty.
*Materials may not reflect entire content of the course.

But by all means, keep saying [[you]]'re taking MIT courses.
