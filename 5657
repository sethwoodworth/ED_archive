<font color="red" size="+2">If you're from ED, FUCK OFF! Yes, this means [[You|YOU]]. This issue has just been made 100times worse by the [[user:iicatsii|ASSHOLE]] who added this to ED. It needs to drop and it needs to die but not while I'm branded a 'predator'.</font>

* met [[Snopake]] on [[TOW|WP]]
* Sceptre also did, he was our mutual [[friend]]. I knew Sceptre even before I met Snopake.
* talked to them both every day, whenever they popped on MSN, Google Talk, whatever
* She sent me a book for my birthday (yes an actual book - that I'm probably going to destroy but that's neither here nor there), so I figured since she thought of me enough to send me something, I sent her [[porn|something]] back (now this is also being twisted into something it's not, it's just a present in return for sending me one, that's it, that's all)
* I [[pedo|developed some feelings]] for Snopake - she seemed like someone who was really likeable and easy to talk to, a good friend, someone who would (well I assumed) always [[cock|stick]] with me and help me when I need kind words..you know, the stuff one generally likes in a prospective partner too. She had a [[furry|pet]] name for me, it was [[Otherkin|"Angel"]]. Friends usually don't give each other [[furry|pet]] names. She had a defense for that, saying "I gave Will (Sceptre) one, I gave [[Phaedriel]] one..etc". Still, generally friends don't give each other little cutesy [[furry|pet]] names.

* We had the innocent [[pedo|"If you were around my age and more available]]" conversation a few times, it didn't alarm her then and I don't see why it should alarm her now.

* I did post a [[blog]] entry about it, basically [[grammar nazi|spelling]] out that I had [[pedo|feelings]] for her. I sent it to her to be honest (my conscience wouldn't let me ignore it - I expect honesty from myself as much as I expect it from others). 

* Somewhere between that and the [[rape|next thing]], Sceptre told me "We've decided to date". Obviously, if you have a [[pedo|crush]] on someone and you find out they decided to [[rape|date]] someone who isn't [[you]], you'd be [[emo|upset]], and I was.

* (Somehow, Snopake showed that e-mail to [[your mom|her mother]]. Personally, I don't know why she should be so alarmed about something she already knew, and this really confuses me), and [[your mom|her mother]] sent me several angry e-mails assuming I was [[Brian Peppers|some evil predator]] or something.

* So I lost one friend - Snopake
* I begged and pleaded with her [[incest|brother]] (The Halo - who I met a little after Snopake) to try to remain impartial (I was asking the impossible as they're brother and sister - my friendship with her should not affect mine with him) and he said "I'll stick with my family on this one until this is over". So I lost another friend.
* Sceptre chose trying [[sex|a relationship]] with Snopake over a friendship with me. So I lost another friend - Sceptre, even though he could've stood up for himself to Snopake and said "I'll befriend anyone I like, and if you don't like it, that's too bad". I respect people who are that loyal, it means they're really your friend.

* I checked out Snopake's talk page and it alluded to [[Phaedriel]] knowing about the situation. Since she was a mutual friend of all of us and never once approached me to talk about it - and instead talked to the other two [[victim complex|(while I was the one hurting the most)]] - I consider that another friend lost (Phaedriel).
* Somewhere a little later, Sceptre decides to tell [[Cyde]] (of all people!) the situation. It's been [[Check your facts|proven]] that Cyde has had it in for me for ages, so I take this as a vengeful and petty action of Sceptre's.
* Someone (who I thought was [[Cyde]] but I've heard was someone else completely) told Danny and the [[Jimbo Wales|Foundation]] (WP:OFFICE) an obviously slanted and twisted version of the issue.

* I decided to retire a little before this, so I put [[wikibreak|'Semi-Retired']] on my userpage.
* I receive a log which was from Sceptre, which basically showed Cyde asking Sceptre to help him look for any reason whatsoever to block me. (log will be mentioned in one of the urls i'm including)

* Cyde blocks me "to help me along to retirement". His block reason is "User has left Wikipedia" - which isn't a reason and that gets overturned. A long argument with Cyde on my talk page and he ignores the damning evidence against him.

* So I obviously e-mailed both Sceptre and Snopake and basically said "How dare you backstab a friend. Snopake shattered my heart into a million pieces and Sceptre just twisted the knife in my back even deeper. The fact that both of you would turn your back on a friend so quick is very appalling and alarming - if you treat your friends this way, how do you treat your enemies?"

* Sceptre [[drama-generating technique|blocks me because of the e-mail]] ("twisting my words" is the so-called reason - a) there was nothing to twist, actions speak louder than words and b) my words and actions have been twisted too), which again isn't a reason, doesn't conform to block policy, but even the ArbCom want that block to stick (you'd think someone would unblock and reblock with an actually valid reason, no?)

* Where Snopake tells me that I need help for being [[pedo|sexually attracted to minors]]. After being corrected by me several times, he confused 'sexually attracted' with 'romantically attracted'. Regardless, he typed this on IRC, which is a medium where you have a chance to think about what you've typed before you type it. Also "my parents forbid me any further communication with Nathan". (Again more parents jumping into the situation, assuming they know everything and assuming the worst) So I lose another friend.

* Now JoanneB says "Consider me another lost friend", for no reason, no explanation after I've considered her a friend for ages. You know, it's the real friends who stick with you, even if they don't agree with your actions.

So this proves:

* Sceptre would turn his back on a good friend just for a [[woman|girl]], and a rather backstabbing one at that.
* Snopake pretends to be nice to people then when the situation is right, she turns the tables on them.
* [[Cyde]] is a lying, backstabbing, cowardly (he won't discuss the issue after being invited a few times to drop the pretenses, be honest with me and take it to e-mail), asshole of an admin (who lied on his RfA - and said he wouldn't get involved with [[userbox]]es and look how that turned out) who would do anything for his own personal gain. This is the exact type of admin (read: [[Tony Sidaway]] is the same) who should be indef blocked. Wikipedia doesn't need their type.

The reason why I say he's lying, backstabbing, cowardly and an asshole (besides the log at the Wikipedia Review post below) is that he apologised to me a few months ago and just recently, conspiring to block me for any reason whatsoever. Someone who geniunely apologises for their mistakes doesn't turn a complete 180 against the person they've apologised to. Someone who apologises for their mistakes won't ignore the other person's e-mails asking for their opinion on various things (I've never gotten an answer from any e-mail I've ever sent Cyde). Also, people don't just tell others "Change your e-mail address because Nathan will hack into it" for no reason (how the hell would anyone really know what my intent is if they don't take the time to ask?).

So my trust in [[Wikipedia]] has been shattered as well.

Q: "You could appeal this with [[Jimbo]], you know."

A: "[[Jimbo]] hasn't listened to anything I've said before, so I don't see why he should now. Besides, if I was unblocked, anyone would look for any reason to block me and I'd be eying people suspiciously. That's not the kind of atmosphere I want to be editing in."
