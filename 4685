The '''LJ-cut''' refers to two things:
# The placing of part of an entry or pictures behind a link, forcing people to click on it to view the delicious pictures within. LJ-cut is a camwhore's best friend. It is also often used to hide [[Fat girl angle shot|fat girl shot]]s, [[goatse]] or [[dead babies|dead baby]] pictures. This is the LJ equivalent of "enter at your own risk". In [[icon]] and [[rating communities]] which are picture heavy, nothing causes more drama than lack of the LJ-cut. Most such communities have a "cut after two pictures" rule, but that doesn't stop [[LJers]] from posting five million pictures of their fat asses and getting the response, "OMG11!111 PUT tat beHind a LJCutt!! I si scared for life!1!"
# The art of [[cutting]] the word [[LiveJournal]] into your arm [[emo]]-style, as to dull the pain.

==Responding to Demands for an LJ-Cut==
The correct response to a demand for a definition #1 LJ Cut is to post the image from definition #2, simply captioned "LJ Cut".  If the underlying complaint is also about [[image]]s or [[NSFW]] content, you may also consider posting a link to [http://www.livejournal.com/users/e_richard/430024.html a helpful guide on "How to Clean Your Friends Page Yourself"].

==LJ-Cut as a Drama-Generating Technique==
Some people's zealous fascination with definition #1 [[LJ-cut]]s can be exploited for [[dramacrat]]ic purposes.  [[Troll]]ing LJ-cut Nazis is a great refresher because it requires little effort and even less thought.

When you have successfully identified an [[LJ-cut]] Nazi, a campaign of friends list bombardment can be highly effective:
# If necessary, set up a [[troll]] account
# Join all of the target's [[communities]] & begin posting the sort of things which will make her freak out: posts with dozens of images, or enormous images, or pages of incoherent unbroken text, or [[porn]]. Tailor your efforts to her individual pet peeve.  Respond to requests for an LJ-cut with "what's an LJ cut?"
# If the complaint is related to large images or [[NSFW]] content, begin posting as much of that as possible as comments to the target's journal entries and those of her [[e-pal]]s.  Basically aim to make every SFW thread she is likely to encounter [[NSFW]].
# Get your own [[e-pal]]s in on the act.  

In many ways, the best part of [[troll]]ing an LJ-cut Nazi is that they'll probably never know why.
