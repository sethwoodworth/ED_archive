Brian Salcedo
'''Brian Salcedo''' is a [[hacker]] who successfully hacked into the [[Furniture Porn|Lowe's Hardware]] credit card system through an unsecured wireless line. He was then [[pwn|tossed into jail for nine years]] before he could do anything with the information. Brian serves as a prime example of how not to run a hacking operation.

==[[Nothing|What did Brian Do, Exactly?]]==

Sometime in early 2003, a couple of [[13-year-old boy|computer enthusiasts]] from [[Michigan]] were driving around the [[Detroit]] suburbs [[Boring|mapping out the wireless networks in the area]]. When they were in a Lowe's Hardware parking lot, one of them noticed that they were connected to an unsecured network being run by the Lowe's. Not wanting to get caught and [[partyvan]]ned, he quickly logged off, but first he made a note of it.

A few months later, a guy associated with the two hackers named Brian Salcedo returned to the Lowe's with the intention of hacking the shit out of the system. Over a series of visits, Salcedo managed to peel back layer after layer of security, eventually hacking into several different stores and the Lowe's Corporate Center.

Salcedo was already known to the [[police]]; in 2000 he was convicted of hacking an [[ISP]] running out of Ann Arbor, MI. This time, however, Salcedo was determined not go get caught. He was going to steal a bunch of money from unsuspecting Lowe's customers and flee to [[Canadia]] and from there to [[Turkey]], which has no extradition laws for internet crime because they have yet to get on the [[internet]].

If this whole plan strikes [[you]] as a bit [[retarded]], then you are [[You win the prize|extremely observant]].

==Brain's [[Epic Fail Guy|Epic Failure]]==
The result was a spectacular failure - sort of like [[Assclown|Michael Bolton's]] attempt at hacking in Office Space. Lowe's employees took note of the perpetrators' [[White trash|1995 Pontiac Grand Prix]] covered in antennas and other [[H-wing|funny shit]]. When the [[Lunix]] based servers that held the credit information for the Lowe's (as well as other Lowe's systems Brian messed with) began to crash, the [[Security Faggots|security faggot]] in charge put two and two together despite his [[Facepalm|incapacity to enable something as simple as WEP on the network he was paid to maintain]].  Store management informed the [[FBI]] who staked out the hackers. After a couple days of monitoring the hackers, the FBI pounced and [[John Locke|fucked their shit up]].

Total take from the operation: [[Fail|$0]] and [[Fail|six credit card numbers]].

Unlike Michael Bolton, the three people associated with the crime didn't get out of "[[Bubba|pound me in the ass]]" prison. Salcedo's accomplices were given sentences of less than a year. Salcedo, the [[LOTR|ringleader]] was given [[Ah fuck, I can't believe you've done this|9 years]]. Notably, he has now surpassed the record of jail time earned from a hacking incident - a record previously held by [[Kevin Mitnick]].

Salcedo's argument against Lowe's is a bit like a [[rapist]] using the "[[asking for it]]" defense...with the [[Fail|same predicted outcome]]. This example was taken from his website:
{{quote|[[Some argue|Others believe]] Lowe's should also be held accountable for neglecting to take appropriate steps to protect consumers' personal information.|[http://www.briansalcedo.com www.briansalcedo.com], [[doing it wrong]].}}

Salcedo also argues that he shouldn't be charged with the losses projected by his intrusion, but by the actual tangible damage done. This would represent a reversal of almost three decades of the criminal prosecution of cyber crime, so [[Fortune|good luck]] with that, Bri.
