Nobody
A frequent subject of Camus novels, it is seldom known that '''Nobody''' spent his life in obscurity living on the streets of Calcutta.  A vortex of existential [[angst]], '''Nobody''' is famous for the ever popular question, "What is being?"  Of course, seeing as the question is always being asked, the question itself is self-defeating.

Condemned to a life of whorenunnery, '''Nobody''' died an ascetic.  Tragically, [[Noone]] was present at his funeral.

A few years later, Nobody was immortalized in poetry by [[bitch|Emily Dickinson]] who coined the infamous words "I'm Nobody, Who are you?" This disturbed the ghost of Nobody who made a deal with God to [[I did it for the lulz|make sure she died of Tuberculosis]] [[For great justice|like every other writer in the 1800's.]]
