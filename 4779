'''Lee L. Mercer Jr.''' is a [[black|"Nigger American Citizen"]] who ran for President of the USA in the 2008 election. He is a [[Democrat]], a former [[Dental Plan|dental technician]], an ex [[IRL troll|bill collector]] and is 100% [[batshit insane|sane]]. According to the FEC, he raised more than 900 million dollars in fundraising during the election, and he spent every penny [http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_08+00+PR].  In 1992, the State of Texas [[X Files|installed an "intelligence hotwire" in him that "cannot be unhooked by anyone."]]

According to his [[crap|impressively-designed]] web site, Mercer's [[SFB|campaign platform]] is as follows: 

{{quote|The United States Government must regulate government sleepers and government regulations authorized thought, ideas, acts, actions, rights, wrongs, controversies, facts, issues and circumstantial evidence through  intelligence research, law research, law enforcement research and criminal law research implementing ROTC communications research innovating education  national and international.|George Orwell}}

==Early Life==

Lee Mercer Jr. was born at an early age. Strangely enough, there is no Lee Mercer Sr. in his family tree.

==[[batshit insane|Reasons for Candidacy]]==

One of his goals was to prove the United States government killed his sex life, his wife's sex life, both his sons' sex lives, his daughter-in-law's sex life and various other family members' sex lives "with Espionage Experimentation and Espionage Exploitation sex killing." Another is "to prove [[W|Jeb Bush]] is all in my house with disease."

==On The Issues==
As the only black person to ever be abducted by a UFO, Lee Mercer speaks fluent ebonic gobbledygook and is an expert on intergalactic issues both big and small. As such, he is the only credible candidate to boldly go where no candidate has gone before...to take planet Earth and mankind into [[Star Trek|the future]] as part of the Federation of Allied Galaxies.
