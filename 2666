== The English Language ==

The English language is [[lie|intelligent]] and has order. [[Americunt]]s took their own spin on it, and gave it better spellings such as dropping an unnecessary 'u' from "color" and "humor". As Americans have never actually mastered the fucktarded "language" English faggots talk, Wikipedia articles' titles are often spelled [[awesome|phaw-nah-tee-cuh-lly]]. However, limeys are just as incapable of linguistic accuracy as yanks, as they have yet to learn how to pronounce the letter "R." You'd think that would be sort of a prerequisite, but apparently not.

[[Americunt|Immer-reekans]] can often be heard demanding 'terrorists' (anyone living outside of the US or visiting, and known everywhere else as a tourist) to "talk English", even when that person may be from England and speaking English. Not realizing either the grammatical or logic based stupidity of their demand, they unknowingly earn a fail times squared on contact with large percentages of 'the far away ones'. [[Americunt|Eye-my-reekans]] commonly poke fun at the [[British]] for their strong pronunciation of the R sound in words that contain an R, but will then add R's themselves where there are in fact no R's, even within their own spellings of English words; for example, pronouncing p-ASS-ta as p-ARSE-ta. In a landmark study, Stephen Hawking theorized that it was the [[Americunt|I-my-rick-aRns]] propensity to remove 'u's and place 'r's where they do not exist that causes them to so easily confuse tourists with terrorists, causing many of todays global conflicts. It is also noteworthy that 101% of [[Americunt|Amma-rycanz]] feel correct in explaining the pronunciation and spelling of English words to the English. Even beginning to question their authority to do so results in a mighty rage anger and much dick measuring with regards to the great hone-noRs for battles of years past.

'''English''' is the only [[language]] that counts. If you don't speak it, it means you are a terrorist.

A summary of modern English in [[C++|C++]]: 
                                  /* History_of_English.cpp */
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    int main() 
        {
        int german;               // Growly, throaty, not Latin-based
        int french;               // Nasally, full of weird spelling, Latin-based
        int moar_latin;           // [[Moar|MOAR!!]]
        std::string english;
        wtf_broth();
        int complex_grammar = 50; // [[Divide_by_0|German/Latin grammar?]]
        std::cout << "Oh no, Vikings!/n" << "????/n";
        norse(complex_grammar);   // Around the time Europe was being raped by [[Vikings]]
        mix(english_lexicon, simple_grammar);
        profit = english;
        std::cout << "Here is your [[Delicious_Cake|English]]/n" << "[[PROFIT|PROFIT!!!!]]/n";
        return (0);
        }
    wtf_broth()                   // Most of our English vocabulary
        {
        std::string english_lexicon;
        german = 26;              // The numbers are percentages
        french = 30;
        moar_latin = 20;
        german + french + moar_latin + 24 = english_lexicon;
                                  /* 24 is random stuff
                                  such as Greek and Arabic.*/
        return (english_lexicon);
        }
    norse(a)                      /* Simpleton raiders, destroying my grammatical inflection?!
                                  It's more likely than you think. */
        {      
        int simple_grammar;
        a - 30 = simple_grammar;
        return (simple_grammar);
        }
    mix(a, b)                     // Mixes the lexicon and the syntax, creating the profit(!!!!)
        {
        std::string profit;
        a + b = profit;
        return (profit);
        }

==Fact Of The Day==

[[Scientist]]s have proven by EST that everybody in the world thinks in English, but [[you|stupid foreigners]] then insist on translating their [[fail|thoughts]] into into made-up "[[oral|mouth languages]]" like [[French]] and [[Los Angeles|Spanglish]].


Apparently the sentence [[Oneoneone|"Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo"]] is a [[Lie|valid]] sentence used by William J. [[Rape|Rapapot]] in the University of [[Furry|Buffalo]].

== The English People ==

{{main|England}}

The English people have buck teeth and sit on their [[ass|arses]] in fairy-land castles with tiny cups of highland tea. 

If you are English you [[Shit nobody cares about|don't count for shit]] and nobody likes you.

Despite what most people think, not everyone in England love the queen, in fact no one really gives a shit about her.

== Full English ==

[[Image:Babypaste.jpg|thumb|120px|Full English Breakfast]]

The full English usually consists of:
* A couple of bits of [[acne|greasy]] [[fat|bacon]]
* A flavorless [[sausage]] or three, composed of 3% pubic hair, 90% wood shavings and 7% bumfluff
* A fried egg
* A spoonful of [[shit|beans]] floating in [[semen|tomato sauce]]
* Half a tomato
