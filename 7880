Subliminal messages are an innocent means of communication which tamper with the inner workings of one's subconscious, influencing people at the cinemas to buy enough coke to rot away the teeth of this girl[http://emo-tears-falling.deviantart.com], and to [[Jesus|worship hippies from 2000 years ago]]. They are useful for making all the girls get nekkid.

== The Origins of Subliminal Messages ==
They were invented [[at least 100 years ago]] by [[Tom Cruise]], using his wikkid powers of Scientology. He is the one who is responsible for influencing [[Goatse]], a sweet, God-fearing, and compassionate man to create [[2000 Goatses|THAT]] series of pictures, which directly caused the mass suicide of three thousand [[Jews]].

== Examples of Subliminal Messages ==
I bet you can't tell that ([[sex|SEX SEX SEX]]) I'm brainwashing you right this ([[cock|COCK]]) moment. By the end of these ([[vagina|VAGINA!!!!]]) few sentences, you are going to have a strong need ([[Loli|You love LOLI!]]) to act upon desires that don't strike you consciously ([[pussy|SWEET MOIST FLAPS!]]).
