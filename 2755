Excitard is a [[forced meme]] which made its first appearance in the 4chan realm. Even though posted in random forums it quickly grew in popularity. The meme consists of an overly excited [[retard]] pointing out or stating more or less obvious phenomenoms with forced and excessive excitement.

The meme follows a basic formula which is used in every copy, regardless of what the actual concern is.

== The formula ==

''Are those (stuttering effect, usually the first letter of the word repeated three times) X''
