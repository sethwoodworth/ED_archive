BME
'''BME''', the [http://www.bmezine.com '''Body Modification Ezine'''], is a collection of pictures and [[shit]] like that posted by people who like to [[tattoo]], [[pierce]], and scar their bodies. It was founded by a Confederate apologist. [http://www.metafilter.com/49480/I-Pledge-Allegiance-to-the-Confederate-States#1222181]The site claims that it "contains the personal experiences of thousands of people all over the planet, in photo and text form. It serves to document the activities of the body modification community in as complete a fashion as possible."  Actually, it is a good source for shock images as well as for occasional [[lulz]]. And [[fap]]ping material, if you're into seeing guys getting their dicks cut off. Watching the [http://www.zentastic.com/videos/bmevideo-3.wmv bmevideo3.wmv] video will cause you many sleepless nights and lulz, you will have been contaminated and will want to show it to someone else so they can share in your pain. Much like AIDS. '''"Eat[ing] the shit of AIDS infected people, directly from their diapers" and injecting the semen from strangers' used condoms into your hacked off breasts is also a pastime featured on [http://www.bmezine.com/news/pubring/20080227.html BME]
'''

Which, when you think about it, is kind of like [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].

Even though BME is chock-full of photos of [http://www.bmezine.com/service/samples/tour4.html self-amputation and guys cutting their own nuts off], the site owners are kind enough to warn that: 

<blockquote>BME contains documentation of dangerous and/or [[Buttsecks|life-threatening activities]] of sometimes questionable legality -- BME accepts no responsibility or liability for the actions of others and urges anyone interested in this subjects to educate them completely and seek professional assistance.

Attempting to replicate any of the acts seen on these pages, including body piercing, can result in serious injury and/or death. We STRONGLY urge you to consult a professional before continuing.</blockquote>

Of course, the amazing man who runs the site doesn't mention that there's no doctor in the fucking world who will agree to castrate you, [http://www.bmezine.com/service/samples/nullohigh/finger.jpg cut off your fingertips,] or [http://www.bmezine.com/service/samples/surghigh/sub4.jpg slice your cock and ballsack down the middle] strictly for the lulz.

Why buy a wedding ring when you can bite each other's ring fingers in [http://www.bmezine.com/news/pubring/20050401.html half] [[Amirite]]?

== [[ZOMG]] I got a new [[tattoo]] ==
Thank [[fuck]]ing [[God]], BME isn't restricted solely to chop-off-hand horrors. You can see lame and/or horrid photos of [http://www.bmezine.com/tattoo/bme-tatt.html tattoos], including plenty of [[ass antlers]], and awful images of [http://www.bmezine.com/news/pubring/20041004/ian4.jpg assholes with pierced assholes]. 

<blockquote>The piercing has to be [[in the ass|placed]] very carefully, or there might be permanent damage to the sphinctal muscle. The piercing can migrate, and possibly it could cause [[shit|incontinence]] if it worked its way fully out. There is also the chance that there could be a constant [[Tubgirl|weepage of fluids]] from the anal passage. I found a bit of this in the early days, and had to wear an absorbent pad for a while. Eventually I found that it ceased to [[shit|leak]], and now I have no problems. I suppose it took about nine months for it to finally heal and stop [[shit|leaking]].</blockquote>

== [[Camwhores]] and such ==
BME hosts its own community, [http://iam.bmezine.com/ iam.BMEzine]. It is full of [[goth]]s, [[emo]]s, tattooed [[camgirls]] and other [[whore]]s who show off their [[goatse|awesome]] mods to the rest of the world. In other words, the kind of shit that keeps [[God_hates_fags|Fred Phelps]] in a perpetual state of rage. 

Not surprisingly, there is an overlap between iam.BMEzine and [[LiveJournal]], in that much self-perpetuating [[drama]] and resulting lulz may be found on both. Except sometimes the drama results from piercings or tattoos gone awry.

==BME Hits [[YouTube]]==
After the great [[2girls1cup]] reactions were finished with, the shocked [[newbies]] who previously only browsed [[SFW]] sites needed to get their shock fix and so looked for the next big thing to [[fap]] over. After many hours of eating hot dogs and fapping to goatse the [[fgt]] internet travelers found a dark little gem in a corner of the [[internets]], known as the [http://www.flurl.com/item/Hatchet_vs_Genitals_u_199612 BME Pain Olympics: Final Round].  It's a video of cocks and balls getting hacked to pieces by hatchets.  Little do the following victims know that the video is entirely fake.  No cocks or balls were mutilated during the making of this film.

The editor of BME believes that Body modification is a very important and spiritual process.
"Remarkable acts should be their own reward, and paths to enlightenment are not a sideshow act."


The E-zine's editor also crusades against the HAET of the system on his fellow [[sick fuck|body-modders]]. For instance, when a [[catholic]] school banned all body piercings for [[religion|religious]] purposes, BME's internet superhero editor came to the rescue and [http://news.bmezine.com/2003/01/25/joe-hatred-strikes-again-the-publishers-ring/ Wrote an angry letter]

<s>[[O RLY?|Oh really]]? Then I guess [http://www.bmezine.com/service/samples/tour4.html] Is '''''VERY''''' safe.</s> That's castration and amputation, not piercing. 

Oh yeah, he also believes that one day a [[X-men|'''BIOLOGICAL MESSIAH''']] will be born... {{quote|If and when humans evolve into something more than human, it will happen in the same way — with a single person. One day, one person will be born the One*. The one who is not homo sapiens sapiens, but homo sapiens superioris. Problem is, we’ve so removed the concept of only the strong and interesting surviving that when this biological Messiah is born, they’ll probably be kicked out of school and die in a gutter because we’ve set such a strong “punish difference” foundation for ourselves.| Shannon Larratt, BMEzine.com}}

This proves that the faggot, like every other retard, [[Creationism|knows nothing about evolution]].  

The "Body Mod" community manages to achieve the impossible and reign as the undisputed whiniest goddamn subculture on the [[internets]].  Their blog is an endless parade of pathetic [[attention whores]] drooling all over each other to exclaim how wonderful and [[special]] someone's latest [[penis]] chopping or [[penis]] [[tattoo]] or [[penis]]-shaped piercing is.  These same people will [[stalk]] random message boards, looking for anyone who dares make fun of their idiotic body "art," frequently using stock flames such as "hey man, it's HIS body! What right do you have to [[judge]] getting [[Britney Spears]] drawn on his ass?"

The reason for this internets [[rage]] stems from the fact that members of the Body Mod [[Klan]] made the fatal mistake of joining a [[cult]] that can't be easily left - [[Emos]] can cut their hair. [[Goths]] can wipe off the makeup. [[Furries]] can take the dog out of their ass.  But the [[idiot]] who got [[Super Mario]] tattooed across his back is stuck with it. epic fail, multiple lulz. See also [[Shemale]].
