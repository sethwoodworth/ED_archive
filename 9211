How do you solve a problem like {{lj|user=xiota}}? How do you hold a tissue to his tears?

==Xiota: The Overview==

* Xiota believes himself to be a genius. He is incorrect.
* Xiota believes himself to be [[logic]]al. He is incorrect.
* Xiota believes himself to be [[nonuglies|nonugly]]. Are we sensing a pattern yet?
* He has a [[poloemily]]-type nose. [[What of it?]]
* His [[Your Mom|mother]] cuts his hair. Waaaa.

Xiota first came to light in an Schoolyard [[Flame]] with [[Poloemily]]. He lost. Miserably.

Xiota cried about it for weeks afterwards, referring to her as a [[bitch]] whenever possible.

==Xiota: One Man, Many Tears==

*[http://www.livejournal.com/~xiota/101757.html Xiota cries about all the stupid people on LJ.]
*[http://www.livejournal.com/community/convert_me/421199.html?thread=16646479#t16646479 Xiota proves that he's clever and rational]
*[http://www.livejournal.com/community/convert_me/431891.html?thread=17372691#t17372691 Xiota gets pains when he thinks]
*[http://www.livejournal.com/users/xiota/102440.html Xiota reads this entry and then cries]. Please note the cameo appearance by [[I_am_lane]].

==Xiota: The Legend==

According to an [[Ghostlight|ancient legend]], there exists [http://www.livejournal.com/community/philosophy/1089752.html?thread=28304600#t28304600 a post written by Xiota] in which he "believes himself Jew for his attractiveness."

==Xiota: The Bitter Rage==

Xiota absolutely hates [[GerbilSage]].  He is only [http://www.livejournal.com/community/liberal/2393069.html?thread=52095981 slightly antagonistic] toward [[Ghostlight]].

Scientists believe he may simply be afraid of the letter G's sensuous curves.

==Xiota: The Genius==

Xiota doesn't know what an [[Pain Series|Ontological Explosion]] is. What a [[n00b]].

==Xiota: The Padawan==

According to an unnamed source, it seems that Xiota worships a little-known [[LJ]]er called [[i_am_lane|i_am_lame]]. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that they are both logical positivists. One day, Xiota will emerge as a Dark Lord of the Sith... or a logical positivist. Either way, it's going to be dark days for the Republic and the [[Star Wars|Jedi]].
