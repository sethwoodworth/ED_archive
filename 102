Like every website on the [[interwebs]], [[4chan]] too has a banning policy, but what makes 4chan bans so much different than other bans (like being a complete dumbass here on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]]) is the fact that to get banned from 4chan you have to do something so horrifyingly stupid that you'd have to be a pathetic [[loser]] to get one. It's like this: If you break a rule on 4chan, it's a ban; if you happen to come across a pissed off admin on 4chan, then be ready for a sure-fire beating from the banhammer. The greatest holder of the banhammer on 4chan was [[W.T. Snacks]], but was subsequently banned himself by [[moot|some faggot]], and during Snack's reign bannings would come for either posting illegal content or BECAUSE HE FUCKING CAN. Nowadays bans are usually just for posting [[CP]] and spamming links and other gay shit like that, but occasionally epic bans can be produced if done correctly. Posting on 7chan or 420chan that you were banned on 4chan will get you banned, also [[Klingons|Worf]] will anally rape you.

==How 2 get banned on [[4chan]]==
These are only a few of the many ways of being banned on 4chan:
*Posting [[CP]] (Sometimes even so much as posting in a thread about [[12chan|pedos]]) - Permaban

*Replying to a thread in which CP has been posted (That includes saying "Reported") - 2 week ban

*Replying to [[Gmask|GMask]] threads. (as they're often full of CP) - 2 week ban

*Having a virus (14 day ban)

*Call to invasion (permaban)

*[[Camwhore|Camwhoring]]

*[[LOL|Impersonating moot]]

*Posting noodz and shit outside of [[B/|/b/]]

*[[4chan.js|Running Javascripts]]

*Posting [[Piccolo Dick]] on [[V/|/v/]] (Results in "Error: Upload Failed" and instant 14 day ban from all boards)

*Post with "'''Meru Otonashi#merumeru'''" in the name field (Instant permaban from all boards for "Ban Evasion", worked in February 6, 2011).

*Posting "[[Surgeon]]" or "[[Surgeon|The Surgeon]]" on any board (auto-ban)

*Posting "nigger" on [[K/|/k/]] (auto-ban)

*Posting "my face when" on [[Sp/|/sp/]] (auto-ban)

==How 2 overcome ban on 4chan==
[[Image:Urbanned.png|thumb]]
{{deceptiban}}

'''Open Command Prompt and type "ipconfig /renew", if you're still banned after the first try, type it again'''


'''If that doesn't work, try these steps:
'''
* Go to your router's page (192.168.1.1 by default)
* In "Status" or "Setup" menu hit "Release IP" button. Save settings
* Disconnect the router from modem
* Remove batteries from the modem and disconnect AC cord (DO NOT TURN OFF THE ROUTER).Leave it for couple minutes
* On your router's web page find "MAC Address Clone" function and change your MAC address to whatever you want (only numbers 1-9 and letters A-F). Save settings
* Plug in AC cord in the modem and reconnect it to the router
* On your router's web page hit "IP Address Renew" button and new IP adress will be assigned to your router
* Get back to trolling, camwhoring and invading other boards, Anon
