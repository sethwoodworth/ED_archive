Jeremy Kyle, also known as the [[chav]] god is responsible for a show aired on British daytime TV all about [[chavs]], along the same lines as Sally Jesse Raphael, Jerry Springer and Ricki Lake. For some reason, the British population thought it was an utterly brilliant idea to come up with our own drama filled fuckfest of hilarious cuntstackery for us non-chavs to laugh at, and embarrassingly painful family feuds and fallouts.  Of course like cinematic violence, we do it [[Lies|SO MUCH FUCKING BETTER.]]

== The Jeremy Kyle Show aka The Chav Show ==

[[Image:Jeremywatcheditforhismum.gif|thumb|God damn, I've just gotta start watching this show again, if only for the [[lulz]].]]
The show airs daily on Britain's ITV1 channel, and it never fails to be a never-ending source of [[drama|dramatic]] [[lulz]]. The show deals with minute family and relationship problems, and always seems to find the most ridiculously fucked up looking people ever -- namely [[chavs]]. [[Noone|NOONE]] watches this program because they think Jeremy is a brilliant problem solver, or because they think these people can get real help. The truth is that it's the British public's source of epic entertainment and gives us the opportunity to realize that in fact, if we were living in a [[aids|crack whore-AIDS-infested-squat]], [[United States of America|we]] [[Lie|would be doing so much better than these fuckwits.]]

Jeremy Kyle is also a patronizing egotistical big headed prick intent on shouting at people.The audience however is 100% white [[chavs]] despite the [[United Kingdom]] having more ethnics than any other country.

People who turn up on the show include but are not limited to:

*Big fat manatee bitches who squeeze out illegitimate children at a rate of knots. (Equally large schools of whale often turn up, disproving that they are even close to becoming extinct, so man those harpoons gentlemen!!!)
*Dirty little [[skank|skank slags]] who fuck anything with a [[penis|one eyed trouser snake]]. 
*Employment challenged twenty something boys wearing entirely too much gold bling, Burberry, and Adidas tracksuit bottoms tucked in their socks. 
*Terminally stupid people. By this we mean [[George bush|THICK AS FUCKING PIGSHIT.]]
*Sexually confused [[gay|gay boy twinks]] who've been sucking cock for money, and think it's a good idea to announce the fact on national television.
*[[Chris Crocker|Gender confused middle aged boys/men]], who want to come out to the world with their chosen name, which is usually something retarded like Trixie or Peaches. 
*A combination of the above in family form, all fighting over who's been [[fucking]] whose best friend/mother/sister/child.
*Religous nutjobs/Paedophiles/Both. Not for interesting debate, but because trolling them on national TV gives him an erection to match his overblown ego.

== Jeremy Himself ==

Before television, Jeremy was a gambling addict who funded his [[immoral]] habit by working as a [[homosexual]] [[cum slut]] earning up to 15 British pounds per day for his services in public toilets. However, his life changed forever when he was arrested and put through a rehabilitation program. This included watching several hours of videos made by moralizing, condescending, smug, pretentious talk show hosts such as Trisha Godard and Ricki Lake.  This induced the delusion that he is in fact a [[Ayn Rand|great moral leader]] you must listen to, ''mate!''  

Jeremy is thus the very paragon of moral virtue.  Well he isn't really, but he likes to think he is.  He stands in front of his live studio audience and pontificates to these lower working class life forms on how they should live their lives, stop being so fantastically [[retard|retarded]] and insisting he's doing it for their own good.  He likes to call wife beaters "brave" for coming on the show to say they're wife beaters, without realizing that admitting it doesn't make it ok&mdash;although if you're married to a dirty [[skank]] she probably deserves being smacked about and [[rape|raped anally with a rusty chainsaw]]. He calls boys "cheeky chappies", usually with a smirk which implies that in fact he is a [[gay|screaming fucking bender]] who takes it up the arse on some dodgy motorway layby whenever he can get the chance.

He puts his guests through the grinder, insisting that if they don't take a lie detector test then they must have something to hide, ignoring a person's right to privacy.  Additionally, he refuses to accept that some people might possibly be in the 4% of inaccurate lie detector test results, and proceeds to belittle them and make them [[cry|cry like a little bitch]] in front of millions of TV viewers.  Conversely, he manages to switch from being a [[Perez Hilton|nasty mouthed little gobshite]] into turning on Mr. Nice Guy and inviting them back at a later date to announce the lie detector results and thank them for publicly humiliating themselves on national television.

He is in fact an arrogant, condescending twat with a God complex and incredibly sadistic drive for publicly humiliating the [[chavs|chav republic]] of Britain.  This in itself is a fine and worthy endeavor,  but his method is irritating, antagonistic, and therefore makes him a complete and utter [[cunt|annoying cunt]].

He is also apparently an un-[[party van|v&]] [[pedo]] according to [http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/2810_kyle.shtml this].

== Jeremy's Fanbase ==

{{facepalm|Dirty fucking FANWHORES get everywhere.| KILL THEM.}}

Jeremy Kyle viewers are predominantly bored people who watch it in the summer having nothing else to do. However...

As with any daytime television personality, there comes a fanbase.  His however, whilst not as disturbing as the [[Harry Potter|Harry Potter Wankfest]], isn't so far off. After a little browsing on the [[internets]], we are pleased to report the following [[fans|fanfag]] site example:

{{Quote|If you think Jeremy Kyle is better than God, Is harder than Rocky, Funnier than Peter Kay, Better singer than Robbie Williams, Better Fashion sense that Trinny and Susanah. Better Looking than Brad Pitt YOU SHOULD DEFO BECOME A MEMBER BECAUSE YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HIM! <3}}

Average fans that watch Jeremy Kyle are [[IRL]] judgmental, middle class housewives who have [[no life]] except for picking up the kids from school, fucking the plumber, and making dinner before going out with her [[Lesbian|girlfriends]] for some [[Alcohol|WKD]]; so they can hide their miserable existence under the veil of "[[Slut|I'm still young, let's take this to the bathroom.]]". Other fans include [[The English|faggots (hairdressers), teenagers, that guy in the underground, BNP members, sluts, and poor people]].

Hey [[Chav]]s,

My name is Jeremy, and I want to help every single one of you. All of you are fat, lazy, single parents who spend every second of their day smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever tried looking after your kids and being a family? I mean, I guess it's fun having unprotected sex as a teenager and expecting to live on benefits, but you all take this to a whole new level. This is even worse than failing a lie detector test.

Draw a line in the sand. There's two sides to every story. But me, I'm pretty much perfect. I have my own weekday show on ITV, and had my own radio show for many years. What have you done with your career, other than "failed your GCSEs miserably then ended up in prison"? I also help disadvantaged children, and have a model wife (She just blew me; don't tell her I'd secretly rather be with a 16-year-old). You are all working class people who should just get a job. Thanks for listening.
