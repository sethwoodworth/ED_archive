'''Swabez93''' otherwise known as [[Gangster | Nathan "Sexclusive" Swaby]] is the creator of the [[Failbook | Facebook]] group: "Hate It Wen U Tel Bredrin Dnt Luk Therz A Boomting Or Sutin N Dey Go N Luk!" The group was well known for attracting some [[Grammar_nazi | grammar nazis]], but gradually became a place of lulz when the group spread like wildfire between the dates of [[Last_thursday|Last Thursday]] and This Thursday.

For those confused to the meaning and purpose of the group Nathan kindly included the following description: "basically (guys) u b wit ur mandem n u will c a boomting or summin eyeing or suttin or doin her ting n u tell a bredin dnt luk n they goooo n luk lyk idiotz baitin u up!!! kmtttt..."

==Pseudonym Etymology==
A lot of people joined the group without being able to decipher what the fuck the title of group said, how to pronounce it... basically there was a shitload of confusion about the whole fucking thing. Fortunately experts have been able to determine the meaning of the title by using some expert [[Urban_dictionary|tools]]. The full English translation is:

''"I dislike the occasions where I am in the company of my fellows and I warn them not to change their perspective because there is a rather attractive young lady in our presence, and instead of heeding my instructions they turn around and stare"''

The description can also be deciphered into:

''"To clarify simply: Gentlemen you are in the presence of your fellows and you will spy a fair dame or an object of indiscriminate origin, whose gaze has met yours or an action of indeterminate purpose or she may simply be engaging in a practice of her own. You inform your fellows that they should not change their focus from whatever jollities you are discussing and instead of heeding your warning they turn around and stare, as those are imbeciles who have not understood your instructions and therefore giving away your intention and making you feel rather uncomfortable"''

==History==

No one knows exactly when the group was created, but it is suspected that Nathan had been out with his fellow breadbins, before considering putting up the group to see if there were any that shared his displeasure at his "boomting" being "luked" at. After several days of [[Masturbation|comtemplation]] Nathan decided to post his group, but not before posting some more pics on [http://www.profilepic.com/Swaybez his ProfilePic.com page.]

Not much is known about the history of the group, whether it got any serious "breadbins" to join is unlikely - this is mainly due to the fact that "breadbins" are inanimate objects and unable to use the internet in anyway shape or form. What is known is that in the last few weeks of its existence the group received a massive wave of publicity due to the fact that several people invited everyone and their dog to laugh at Nathan's poor English and use of Capitalising Every Word In A Sentence To Make You Look Proper Gangster And Shit.

Then suddenly there was a massive FAIL on the part of Nathan.

Despite the group being "Just for fun - Random", Nathan had forgot to change his privacy settings. It didn't take long for one smartass to find a picture of Nathan by clicking on the link for his profile. Some minor lulz were had, because Nathan looked about seven years old and had a baby face. Later that day several other smartasses discovered that once again despite the group being "Just for fun - Random", Nathan had posted his legitimate actual email as the contact info for the page. 

Someone reposted the image of Nathan, branded his face with the word FAIL and posted the email address below. Some suspect this was the work of the OP but there has been no proof. 

Another mass wave of people hit the group resulting in it rising from just 600 members to 941 members 24 hours later. More insulting comments were posted accusing Nathan of butchering the English language, people not knowing whether the group was real or for the lulz, and some people actually coming to the defence of Nathan.

Eventually Nathan caved. He set his profile to private completely and set the group to secret. Some debate its existence, but its [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=167198047252 there.]

Nathan posted this statement before he left:
{{quote | Lol I Just Realise All These Posts Etc..LOOOL You Lots Give Me Joke But True Say Come To Me When Its Illegal To Write How You Speak OnFacebook..Yuh Digggyyyy?..Fakayutes Kmt Loool..I Love How You Lot Try Internet Hype But Yeahhh If U Write Summin On Ere Then That Means You Joined But One Second...If You Dont Know What It Means Why You Gonna Join..Silly People...For People Wo Can Relate & Speak In Same Way As I Do..So Yerh Bugger Off..Ive Gt 15 GCSEs So I Think Am Qualified To Speak However I Wish!! }}

It has been proved impossible to know what this means, though it has tested positive for bullshit.
