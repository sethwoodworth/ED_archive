'''What''' (alternatives below) is a valid response to an [[TL;DR|overly lengthy]] [[journal]] entry, [[comment]] or black person. Also used in response to an entry, question, comment, [[forum]] post, etc. that is just completely un-fucking-believably [[stupid]].  WHAT is always a worthwhile addition to any conversation, demonstrating one's [[Unwarranted self importance|superior]] [[Smart|intellect]] and mastery of the [[English]] [[language]]. Whenever you find yourself in a situation on the [[internets]] where your [[opinion]] [[Never|really matters]], ''what'' is for you!  It also apparently originates from the [[Something Awful]] forums, specifically [[Something Awful#FYAD|FYAD]]. [[Something Awful]] invents everything, kind of like [[Al Gore]] and [[black]]s. The use of ''what'' is, of course, a [[ban]]nable [[offense]] on Something Awful nowadays.

Contrary to popular opinion, [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT?|they speak English in What]].

==Correct Usage==

* '''what''' - a very general use of the term. Can denote confusion, surprise, excitement or rage.


* '''WHAT''' - using [[caps]] often implies emphasis and emotion. 


* '''wait what''' - denotes confusion, used when the thread or conversation shifts topic too quickly.


* '''wat''' - used to denote the deepest confusion, only when something is so absurd and off-base that a stunned sounding "what" is corrupted into a simple sound because of the amount of retardation that has affected the mind. This is generally used when you cannot understand OP or when they are being completely non-sequitur. For instance:

'''Speaker 1:''' Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
'''Speaker 2:''' wat


* '''wat ¯\(°_o)/¯''' - Same as "wat," but shows that the poster is not a [[newfag.]]


* [[lolwut]] - reference to the lolwut peach and often humorously denotes confusion at something ridiculous.


* '''wut''' - can denote confusion and sluggish response, probably also from retardation


* '''WUT''' - denotes emphasis on confusion


* '''what is this i dont even''' - used only when something is terrible, inappropriate or so bad that it requires remarking. Unlike "wat," this is used when the OP makes sense, but is completely wrong or stupid. 


* [[i'm 12 years old and what is this]] - age is included to show that even with the most experience, one can still be incredibly disgusted by lack of quality.

==Opposite Usage==
An excessively small post answered by a [[verbose]], profoudly [[TL;DR|lengthy]] response.
*<font color=red>xx</font><font color=blue>dead</font>in<font color=purple>myself</font><font color=red>xx</font>: yesterday i was at the store.
*<font color=orange>II</font>JonasBrotherFanFAN<font color=orange>II</font>: Well might I say, old pal, upon reading your message I was met with a combination of both surprise and quite a tingling sensation below the left ear. Why is this you might ask? I was infected with [[herpes]]... on the [[earrape|ear]]. Yes on the ear. "Why is this?" you might ask, good sir. In [[2006]] I was experimenting with a very good, moral friend and [[dildo|a nondetachable artifact imitating the human male's reproductive organ]] and my friend... I'll call him Bill, because that was his name, decided it would be fun to blindfold me and make me think ''his'' own disease-ridden reproductive organ was our experimenting device. He then proceeded to ram the whole thing in my ear. Barely a near death experience! Ha! As you see this unfortunate case hasn't affected my sense of humor yet. Clearly the friend wasn't as good as I thought, heh! Till next time, I'll keep you posted good sir... if the [[STD]]s don't kill me by then! Hah! Or was that [[Offensive|in bad taste]]? If so, sorry, I did not intend this by any means.
