The Chaser
[[Image:The Chaser's War on Everything on bins.jpg|thumb|right|Do '''NOT''' fuck with us]]
'''The Chaser''' is an [[old media]] team of [[Australian]] [[IRL troll|IRL trolls]] and Lulz Patriots, who produce a political sketch show called '''''The Chaser's War on Everything''''', and the now-finished satirical news show '''CNNNN'''.

Among many others, they have successfully trolled pretty much every Australian political figure ever, APEC (and, by proxy, [[George Bush]]), [[necrophilia|dead celebrities]], DIY superstore chains, [[Scientology]], fundamentalist [[Christians]], Scottish standup comedy, [[NORP|the Australian public]], mainstream media (especially the [[Fox News|shittiest examples of it]]), and any number of [[Concerned Mother|Concerned Mothers]].

The Chaser hurt their first high profile butt in 2003, when they published the then-Prime Minister [[John Howard]]'s [[dox|home phone number]] in a newspaper they produced together, so that the [[mundanes]] could contact Howard to voice their displeasure at his decision to involve Australia in the Iraq War.  Sadly, despite their earnest efforts, they are about as funny as the bloodied stool that ma produced just after her aneurism.

==Notable Chaser trollings==

===Trolling APEC for our Lulz===

[[Image:Chaser_fake_apec_pass.jpg|thumb|''The fake security passes used by The Chaser for their APEC stunt, containing ever-so-subtle clues regarding their authenticity.'']]
In a spectacular display of trolling spirit, The Chaser - disguised as a Canadian motorcade - broke through two security checkpoints around the hotel where George Bush was staying during the 2007 APEC World Leader's summit in Sydney. They got as far as the front of the hotel, when Licciardello stepped out dressed as Osama bin Laden. It was at this point when the APEC security [[OH SHI-|twigged that things weren't quite as they should be]], and Morrow and Licciardello were [[jail|collared by the popos]].

[[Some argue]] that the fact that The Chaser made a mockery of millions of dollars worth of APEC security - and that they could had have their own [[ass rape|security cordons broken through by Bubba]] if convicted - makes this the finest example of Lulz Patriotism ever seen since [[Chris Morris]]'s day.

===Trolling dead people for our Lulz===

Last Thursday, The Chaser performed a ditty assassinating the characters of a number of dead celebrities - from [[Steve Irwin]] to [[John Lennon]] to [[Princess Diana]] - which drew plenty of complaints from [[butthurt]] [[aspies]], and other such examples of bottom-feeders who shouldn't be watching a show like The Chaser's War on Everything in the first place.

===Trolling sick children for our Lulz===

[[Lulz]] is defined as laughter at the misfortune of others. Bearing this in mind, the Chaser decided that much lulz were to be had from unfortunate sick children, and did a sketch entitled [[Unrealistic expectations|"The Realistic Make-A-Wish Foundation"]]. In this sketch, dying kids were given cheap pieces of crap instead of the traditional trip to [[Disney|Disneyland]] or whatever. Pleased with their trolling, the Chaser sat back to await lulz.

What they got was an [[epic]] level of [[butthurt]]. [[Over 9000|Countless]] Australians, from the mightiest [[Kevin Rudd|Ruddkipz]] to the weakest [[Chin-chan|chin]], raised their [[Furry|paws]] to their eyes and cried [[BAWWWWW]] with one voice, despite the fact that when [[Shaun Micallef]] did it, it was funny as hell. In a bid to shut everyone the hell up, the [[Old media|ABC]] promptly [[b&]] the Chaser for two weeks.

Upon their return to the air, the Chaser put out a [[Troll's Remorse|heartfelt]] press release, in which they declared that they were [[Lie|very sorry]] for the sketch, and would in future stick to making fun of [[John Howard|politicians]], because that [[shit]] never gets [[John Howard|old]].

===Trolling Rugby League hooligans for our Lulz===
Licciardello got another spanking from Larry Law back in 2006, when he was charged for selling fake knuckledusters and weapons at the game of a <strike>rugby</strike> Rugby ''League'' (get it right, faggot!) team known for having [[Muslim|hooligan]] fans. Much butthurt followed.

===Trolling the tabloid media for our Lulz===
The Chaser also tried to raid the offices of ''Today Tonight'', a [[Fox News|piece-of-shit tabloid news show]], in order to rape their anchor [[whore|Anna Coren]] for the lulz. Sadly, they were apprehended by [[The Man]] at the doors, and ''Today Tonight'' went to the effort of informing the Supreme Court that tabloid journalism is [[Serious Business]] that should not be mocked. And thus, they obtained an injunction to stop The Chaser from showing their footage. Here is the Today Tonight's version of events:

Happily, The Chaser found a way around the injunction:

===Trolling airport security for our Lulz===
The Chaser once bought two Virgin Blue tickets in the name of "Terry Wrist" and "Al Kyder", to test how secure domestic Australian flights are against terrorists. Virgin Blue later criticized The Chaser for wasting precious [[Jew gold|taxpayers' money]] for the sake of [[lulz|"childish humor"]].
