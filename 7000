Riddle Time

{{notice|If you are reading this from the future, it's July 2009 AD atm.}}.

'''Riddle Time''' is a fairly lulzy, promising new [[meme]] currently playing on /[[b]]/ and the first true sign of [[Original Content]] since [[300]] AD. It is designed to stimulate the old [[Grey Area|grey matter]] of the [[peanut gallery]] and create lulz through [[zero|problem resolution]].

This exercise is also a meme that requires actual [[newfags|audience]] participation and (hopefully) some thought - something in short supply around [[4chan]] since mid-2007 when [[m00t]] converted to [[Judaism]] and started hoarding [[OC]].

==Method==

'''Riddle Time''' is usually started by the [[OP]] with an image [[macro]] in which he poses a hypothetical 'riddle' that needs to be resolved following the directions in the macro. 

Unlike the related [[Delicious Cake]] meme, subsequent posters chime in to answer the riddle with textual responses rather than by taking [[OP]]'s macro and [[MS Paint|doodling all over it]] and reposting the macro in response to OP.

Image:Another-riddle.png|Leave switch '''A''' on for 10 minutes, then turn it off and flip switch '''B''' on and walk on the other room. If the light is ''on'', it's switch '''B'''. If the light is off, it's either switch '''A''' or '''C'''. Touch the lamp, if it's ''hot'' it's switch '''A''', if it's ''cold'' it's switch '''C'''.

''For you tards who don't understand this'': If door '''A''' leads to heaven and door B leads to hell, the lying bird will tell you that the truthful bird will tell you to take door '''B''',  and the truthful bird knowing that the other lies will tell that the lying bird will tell you to take door '''B'''.  So choose door '''A'''.
