Schizophrenia
{{stub}}
[[Image:schizophrenic.jpg|thumb|right|It can be difficult to distinguish a schizophrenic who thinks he is Lassie from a [[fetish]]ist who just wishes he was.  Looking at such an ugly picture, though can make a person go crazy.]]

Unlike fake TV [[psychic]]s, people with '''schizophrenia''' are the real thing. Although some call them [[insane|crazy]], this is untrue.  Schizophrenics see into other planes of existence, parallel universes, the future, etc.  Of course the human mind cannot handle all that, so these people can't use their powers for world domination, like a [[Adolf Hitler|responsible person]] would. Instead they use their powers to walk around frightening children and smelling of urine.

The fact of the matter is, you are a personality existing merely inside the mind of realized schizophrenics. You have been imagined and the reading of this causes you to question the possibility that when you convinced yourself of being real, you weren't actually in control. No more need for denial, your thoughts aren't even your own, seeing as you don't actually exist. Congratulations, this is the completion of the game, this is the meaning of your existence. But please, continue. 

Schizophrenia is the exact same thing as split personality disorder, and often makes someone whom has been diagnosed more susceptible to [[trolling]] (if he is not smart) or hypochondria (if he is stupid).

It is very important that schizophrenics take their medication regularly to prevent them from falling up off the Earth. If you are chatting with a new acquaintance [[OL]] who seems like an extraordinary [[wackjob]], asking "Have you stopped taking your meds?" is the [[drama]]tic thing to do. If the person doesn't seem crazy, throw in the question anyway, just to liven up conversation. [[Britney Spears]] is severely schizophrenic, as well as being diagnosed with several other [[mental disorders]].

===Paranoid Schizophrenia===

The [[paranoid]] type have used their psychic abilities to fully comprehend the true motives of those around them.

**"Dear Miss Taupok, You make me so fat. You should crawl under a rock and hibernate there till you get flattened and burn off all your flubber Someday I will make sure sing a song of the skies and all your beautiful friends. You = a goldfish in a fish tank.. If I saw you now Iâ€™d quickly shut my eyes and dance a tribal rain dance. I would build an army of cute guys just for you. I would get your name tattooed on my boyfriends armpit that says Prootproot. If I could sing you any song it would be ding dong bell We could drink the cool night breeze under the stars.

**"Other studies have also found links between the parasite and schizophrenia. T. gondii infection is known to damage astrocytes, support cells in the brain that are also affected during schizophrenia. Pregnant women with high levels of antibodies to the parasite are also more likely to give birth to children who will develop the disorder."
