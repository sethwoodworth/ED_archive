Gryphon
[[Image:Griffin.jpg|thumb|Is... there... a naked man orgy in my pot?]]

A '''gryphon''' is a mythological furry creature with the head of an [[america|eagle]], the body of a [[lion]], and the brain of a [[16-year-old girl]]. It also likes [[shotacon|boys]] with [[cock|wands]].

The only people who spell it with a "y" are [[furries]], [[otherkin]] and [[England|anglophile]]s under the delusion that misspelling words makes them more magical.

Gryphons can also be disguised as [[gays|gay men]] from a [[Mozambique|far away land]]. If you attempt to befriend a Gryphon, you will be [[raped]] and have to resort to the [[Waaaambulance]] for immediate help... unless you're a [[furry]] and like it like that.

Griffin is also the last name of Peter Griffin from ''Family Guy''. "My name is... Pea....Tear...Griffin."
