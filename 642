Ashley Madison

'''Ashley Madison''' is a website which was founded in 2001 by Jew with the sole purpose of shamelessly promoting [[sex|adultery]].  Their slogan, "Life is short, have an affair," says it all.  Basically, the site's primary function is to go about breaking families and couples apart, all the while profiting off of the resulting pain and suffering.  The best part: Ashley Madison has been endorsed by practically every daytime talk show and celebrity, including [[fat|The View]], [[gay|Ellen Degeneres]], [[cockmongler|Dr. Phil]], [[America|Good Morning America]], black person, and many others (Keep in mind that most of these shows tend to promote wholesome family values, and the irony should be pretty clear).  Even [[old|Larry King]] gave the website his hearty seal-of-approval.  Surprisingly, the media has taken fairly well to the website, with commercials airing on several major T.V. networks.  Now that you're familiar with the site, the next question on your mind is probably, "how does it work?"

==Getting Started==

Unless you have shit-tons of money, Ashley Madison is probably out of your price range.  The site works on a credit system, with [[bullshit|1000 credits costing $249]].  To get in contact with someone, you have to use some of your credits before even sending a message, and hope that they aren't one of the many trolls on the site who make accounts purely to fuck people over, or one of the thousands of robot accounts which will message you immediately once you sign up for an account.  Assuming you've purchased an account, and also managed to find somebody relatively interesting and attractive, Ashley Madison does everything it can to hinder the relationship, first by forcing you to put up a profile picture (if you're on Ashley Madison, there's no way in hell you're even remotely attractive) and second, by continuing to charge you for each message which you send.  The worst part is that any message you send is probably either going to a computer or to a greasy [[Asian|Chinese]] man sitting in the basement of a spark plug factory.  All in all, the website is a cheap gimmick founded solely on the premise of Jew people out of money, while also promising kinky, wild sex.

==Ashley Madison Users==

The site itself is primarily composed of four types of users:

*Legitimate Swingers:  These are the fat, middle-aged losers who are at the end of their rope(s), and are hoping to find one last glimmer of passion in their lives before age sentences their wives to flabbiness and incontinence.  Desperate doesn't even begin to describe these douches; basically, imagine a lonely, balding obese man with gigantic, square-rimmed glasses who is so desperate for action that he would pay two-hundred and fifty bucks for a prostitute, and you've got a good idea of what these mouth-breathers are generally like.

*Cougars:  These lonely female panthers are typically unsatisfied with their husband or lover's tiny cock, and join Ashley Madison seeking a man who looks like the guy on the Brawny towels.  These [[bitch|bitches]] will do just about anything to get a younger guy in the sack, which includes [[camwhore|flashing their wrinkly tits and bone-dry va-jay-jays for the camera]].

*Trolls: Since you don't need to pay to sign up for an Ashley Madison account, lots of Trolls make fake accounts and post ridiculously erotic pics so that the Swingers and Cougars will waste all of their credits desperately trying to get some action.  

*Vindictive Lovers: Ashley Madison really isn't all too much of a secret, so it's become fairly common for one partner in a relationship to create an account solely to see if the other partner is trying to cheat on him or her.  Frankly, the entire situation seems pretty retarded; if you legitimately think your partner is cheating on you, acting like a little bitch and snooping around on a website with millions of users isn't going to solve your problems.

==How to Troll Ashley Madison Users==

Aside from the obvious tactic of creating a fake account with a hot girl's pic and simply not replying to any messages, there are several humorous tactics for fucking with Ashley Madison fags:

*The ol' bait and switch tactic: Once someone has contacted you, get all possible information out of them, including address and telephone, and then contact his or her partner, and tip them off to the place where you would have arranged to meet with the faggot who initially contacted you.  Imagine the dumbstruck look on his or her face when they are greeted not by a seductive young slut, but instead by the partner whom they had been planning to disgrace.  Lulz, assuredly, will ensue.

*The White Knight Approach:  Assuming you have the money to pay for an account, send out mass messages to random people, claiming that you are their spouse or partner, and are extremely disappointed in him/her for going behind your back and trying to cheat on you.  Alternatively, you can also send out messages claiming to be a friend of someone's spouse or partner, and suggest that you will let them know about their attempted shenanigans if they don't admit the truth to their partners.

*The Misinformation tactic:  Send a message to a horny swinger claiming to be a luscious, young (and extremely vulnerable) teenage girl.  Arrange to meet in a public setting where many people will be around to witness any potential events unfolding (yourself included).  Now, convince either a gay friend or an extremely large and intimidating male friend (bonus points if he's black) to meet the guy and claim to be the girl from the website.  Note: This prank works even better the more gay friends you get in on it; one gay guy sitting down at a guy's table can ruin his night, but ten gay guys sitting down at a guy's table might actually make him question his own sexuality.

==Quotes==

As with most things on the internet, Ashley Madison is not without its fair share of criticisms.  One website in particular, [http://www.AshleyMadisonSucks.com AshleyMadisonSucks.com], has documented many of the different stories which disgruntled patrons of the site have had to share:

|*I actually did put up a profile with a 5'4" 210lb middle-aged man with weird fetishes, and got interested messages... hmm... scam and cheese sandwich anyone?
|*Some Lonely Fat Fag
|*You mean the cute little 19-yr old blonde that wants to do all kinds of sweet things to my 55 yr old body plus watch sports on TV isn't real?  And the email notifications from profiles that don't exist aren't just anomalies?  So when I went to pay money online via credit card -- I noticed the payment page wasn't (isn't) on a secure server.
|*"J"
|*AM is a scam. They have people working for them. They study your profile & they initiate contact. Once you respond, you get nothing. Most of the members you contact (after showing interest in you), they vanish!! The pics from the "private showcase" are fake. Some pics are used by more than one female member. Other pics don't even belong to that person you contacted. The women look skinny in the profile pic & then the private pics belong to heavier women!!
|*By 'heavier', I believe she means lardlier.
