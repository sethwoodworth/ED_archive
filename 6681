So, I heard you [[pedophile|liek chillun]]?

==BALEETED==

Puellula has vanished from the [[tubes]]. This is because [[pedo]]s spend all their money on [[CP]].


==Ahoy, pedophiles ahead!==
Puellula.com is a website. Not just a site, but a site full of pedophiles. And pedophiles have urges. And those urges tell them to stick it in your daughter's pooper.

[[Image:Openheart.jpg|thumb|left|Apparently, this means something to pedophiles. Once we find out we'll tell you]]
Lindsay Ashford, pictured at right before his inevitable forced castration, is a childlover and pedophile.  The site is the second biggest pedophile propoganda machine on the [[internets]], surpassed only by [[Wikipedia]].  The website is geared toward brainwashing little girls into thinking that it's OK for adults to anal rape them.  After all, pedophilia is a sexual orientation, not a [[sick]] deviance!

==Oh Noes!==

Puellula will close on December 1, 2006 [http://www.puellula.com/Support.html]. 

If you wish to prevent this, you must donate your money and soul. It's for [[freedom]], so it's okay. 

The damn [[liberal]] [[Internet Police]] have closed Lindsay's [[PayPal]] account, so you will have to send him a [[STFU|nice]] [[sick fuck|letter]] of [[LOL|support]].
