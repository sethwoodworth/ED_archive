==Chemo 3==

''[[Post ending in XXX]]''

[[File:Post_ending_in_chemo_PM.png|1000px|center|thumb|On 2/21/10, [[moot]] boldly [[chemo|operates on]] the last three digits of all posts in an attempt to kill the virulent, cancerous tumours that are [[post ending in]] threads.]]

==Results of the Chemo==
On June 18, Moot learned that the cancer was inoperable, and issued a [[Old_/b/_Day|DNR]] order on the ailing /b/.  Moot had this to say about the old /b/:

{{quote|/b/ has changed.
it's no longer about original content, epic GETs, and win
it's an endless series of reposts, perpetuated by newfags and trolls
fail - and its consumption of /b/, has become an unstoppable cancer.
/b/ has changed.|Moot}}


And if you weren't a newfag or a retard you should have quickly realized that moot is a gamer and was just playing ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. The song that was playing on /b/ was the opening song and the above quote should actually be this:


{{quote|war has changed.
it's no longer about nations, ideologies or ethnicity
it's an endless series of proxie battles, fought by mercenaries and machines.
war and its consumption of life, has become a well oiled machine.
war has changed.|Snake from Metal Gear Solid 4}}


<del>here's a link to the complete MGS4 Intro. Of course if you're not a newfag you shouldn't have to see - WHY DON'T YOU JUST FUCK OFF?!?!?question mark??

==The End==
On June 19th 2008, after many attempts to revitalize /b/ by Anonymous, the board died due to cardiac arrest at 7:30AM CST. Good night sweet prince. Or maybe [[Moot]] was just trolling everyone. [[Old_/b/_Day|Who knows?]]

== Aftermath ==

Aftermath, soon infectees/cured people/people with the serum injected into them for the cure to cancer, turned to super zombies that can run faster than a nigger from a cop and make you shit bricks. Only [[Will Smith]] can run the transmission on all AM frequencies, find the cure, become an hero and take those Arab with him.

==/b/ still delivers==

On 19th June 2009, an [[Americunt]] anon came to /b/, wielding his mighty [[cock|sword]], thus adding to the effort to [[pwn|destroy]] the shitty cancer with a pure dose of [[Epic win|FUCKING WIN]]


[[Image: 1245378840619.jpg]]

/b/ was skeptical, and claimed that OP would not deliver. [[Obvious|Surprisingly]], /b/ was [[Fail|wrong]], and OP delivered delicious raep in the form of a [[Jewtube]] video.

==Newer attempts to chemo==

On the 3rd of January 2011, an anon appeared named Hatefag!B8kEEPERWU. As many other anons, he had an idea. But, as we all know, [[You|anon is lazy]] and nobody will ever actually do as he says.
