'''Hardstylenno''' is another tool who tried to use ED to get revenge on an ex-lover. Hardstyle came to ED to create AIDS-ridden articles on his enemies, instantly under the [[Unwarranted Self Importance|impression]] he was a badass ED editor. What he didn't realize though is that [[gay]] [[furries]] with [[ADHD]] who typesex with other furries online in [[Second Life]] and get [[BAWWW|whiny]] over the furry community on [[Steam]] are not actually good editors at all.

==Typical Furfaggotry of a Typical Furfag==
Ever since he was born, Hardstylenno was a complete [[furfag]]. He made it his lifelong quest to squeeze the [[cum|man juice]] out of every [[cawk]] that became available to him, earning the infamous title of "furry [[cumwhore]] of [[Steam]]".

After [[In the ass|taking]] a nearly uncountable number of dicks, he tried to find a [[faggot|mate]] which flat out failed miserably, ending up in his quick internet [[depression]]. Soon after, he met a furfag named DarkFolf, who both rode out the last drops of [[semen]] out of each other, and soon ended up in what must be one of the most [[lulz]] ensuing tirade of shitspewing furfaggotry that Steam has yet seen. Even though he still can't get over DarkFolf not being his, he still tries to pathetically troll DarkFolf in any which way.

[[Image:patrick13.jpg|thumb|Such [[shitty|amazing]] art!]]

Aside from that, he changes his [[fursona]] at least once a day, picking the most stereotypical furfag avatars that he could find, and then flaunting about how he has green fur or is a [[FYIAD|snake]], or some equally dumb shit. Even then, most his fursonas are stolen from someone else. Long story short, furfags with ADHD somehow manage to be even whinier than the [[Retard|rest of the short bus]].

He's also famous for constantly spreading lies about his enemies, befriending others, convincing them the cool people are [[lie|fucking lame]], and breaks up internet relationships based entirely on furry secks. He once had a total of 19, [[WTF|<b>NINETEEN</b>]], [[jailbait|mates]] at a time.

Meanwhile on YouTube, aside from [[newfag|starting out]] and getting his account [[banned]] for uploading songs from XeRa6's account, he usually makes shitty stopmotion [[Garry's Mod]] videos which include [[old memes]], [[sex]] jokes and shitty [[techno]].

==Hardstyle vs. DarkFolf==
Recently Hardstylenno was dumped from an Internet relationship with DarkFolf after he realized how much of a whiny slut he was. Normally, Hardstylenno would used to this since most of his relationships only ever lasted a few days.

Darkfolf had turned to [http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961761740 Daedalus's] side. Daedalus spent his time [[unrealistic expectations|making anti-furry Steam community groups in the hopes that they would actually do anything and that the world would change for the better]]. DarkFolf had suddenly turned anti-furry after listening to [[Internet Tough Guy|Daedalus]] (although he still faps to gay furry all day erry day) thus Hardstylenno went batshit crazy and tried to troll [[trying too hard|as much as he could]].

Hardstyle started whining to all of DarkFolf's [[friends]] about how much butthurt he was experiencing. After getting a "wat-the-fuck-ever" response from everyone, he went ahead and made an ED article on DarkFolf which in the beginning was a [[Crap|shitpile]] as Hardstylenno lacked [[grammar]] or knowledge of Wikimarkup. He soon took his faggotry even further and began bitching and moaning about the article EVERYWHERE: 

*On [[Skype]],
*On [[Steam]],
*On [[Youtube]],
*DarkFolf's Steam Page,
*In two Steam Groups about the [[stupid|shenanigans]],
*To the [[Admins]],

...even though [[nobody cares|everyone is tired of it already]], and not interested in some [[butthurt]] furfag. The only reason his article stuck was because of everyone else's contributions (and because he put it on again after it got deleted - twice). He even called himself a "[[Fucktard|badass article writer]]" after being here for [[Newfag|less than a week]].

===Plan backfires===
[[image:Cyraxobvioussock.png|thumb|right|Hurr [[How do I shot web|how do I used sock]]]]
Sooner or later this page appears, Hardstylenno now trying to get the page deleted using [[user:Winzor22|his]] [[user:Cyrax44|sock]] [[User:Wishmaker|accounts]]. Hardstyle has no idea how to [[Spy#Psyops|psyop]]. Even with his sock accounts, he gives away his presence with his shitty grammar, and the fact that [[Captain Obvious|the accounts sign up one right after the another]].

After realizing how much of a fucktard he now looked, Hardstyle went and deleted his [[YouTube]] and [[DevianTART]] accounts and made his Steam account private. Hopefully he'll never be seen again.

==FurDrama==
Realising he was [[GTFO|not wanted]] on [[ED]], Hardstyle and his closest friends set to work on a Wiki called FurDrama. They described it as a small, furry version of ED. [[Portal:Furfaggotry|That already exists, dipshits]]. Articles were written about Hardstyle's greatest enemies - people who defriended him or said something nasty about him. The Wiki was up for about a week or so until it got shut down due to leaking privacy.

Hardstyle's circlejerk thought it was a [[win]], but any outsider will look at posts like [http://steamcommunity.com/groups/fuckisthisshit/announcements/detail/864879991948146324 these] and wonder why they think writing large, unclear biographies is lulzy.

==Where is the little cockshiner now?==
[[Image:FurryRageQuit.jpg|thumb|I'm quitting the internets!]]

Like all whining faggots do when they've had their e-penis [[Pwnt|handed to them]], Hardstylenno gave into [[raeg]] and posted he was [[Quitting IRC forever|QUITTING THE INTERNETS]]. Of course, like all tools over the years, he couldn't live without internet [[Attention whore|attention whoring]]; thus, [[Lulz|he was back a week later]].
