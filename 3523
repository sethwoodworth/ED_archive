Gullible
''DID YOU KNOW? DID YOU KNOW? DID YOU KNOW?'' 95% of all Americans are scientifically proven to not believe everything they're told?? DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT! [[Image:DID YOU KNOW.PNG|thumb|Really, look!]]

Although this word is is well-known to speakers of the English language,  [[gullible]] is not in the dictionary[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_Abgf2BnA][http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-tFNK9OAwo]; however, it is written on the ceiling. No really, look.

On one level, the whole of Encyclopedia Dramatica is an exercise in gullibility.
This is because we are all filthy [[Furries]].

The "gullible isn't in the dictionary" joke can sometimes be defeated by agreeing with the person who tells you this, saying that you already looked and it really wasn't there. If they look, you win.
