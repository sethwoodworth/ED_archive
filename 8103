(Click for Urine Box Plans!!!!!111!ZMOG1!]][[Image:Modem-vorne-index.JPG|box|right|thumb|A MODEM was a pre-internet drama generating device. It also converted T-PHILEZ into [[ITTY BITTY BABY ITTY BITTY BOAT|BEEPS]] and [[Boobs|BOOPS]].]]
Back in the good old days of the internet before [[girls]] were [[no girls on the internet|allowed]], everyone was seeking information that was too hot for school libraries.  The first generation of basement dwelling [[H4X0r]]s set up crude dial up [[BBS|bulletin board systems]], dial-up hours 11PM to 6AM only, where they distributed their [[1337]] E-zine textfiles through this early series of six or [[Ted Stevens|less tubes]].  Before we carry on, it should be noted that these textfiles were refereed to as "philes", "textfilez", "T-PHILEZ" or any other stupid shit that hackers thought would sound cool.  98[[%]] of the textfiles on the internet today are from this [[1980s|ancient era]].


Moreover, the information on this Information Super Highway consisted only of excerpts from [[The Anarchist Cookbook]], [[Paladin-Press]] publications, and pirated copies of Commandar Keen. It is worth noting that there was pornography, however only on the [[gay]] thoroughfares.


While most of the authors of textfiles were either prepubescent or in their early teen-years, the authors of these angst-ridden poorly spelled love letters to growing up in suburbia are now grown-ups. Moreover, thanks to Jason Scott and his [http://www.textfiles.com Pre-Internet Drama Archive], it is now possible to blackmail them IRL by threatening to publicize [http://www.textfiles.com/hacking/novhack.txt embarrassing things they wrote over 15 years ago]. Thus, one can generate [[A plus|A++++++++]] Internets drama  out of pre-internets drama.


==Internet Anarchy==
The first and most famous t3xtph1l3z0rxz of them all was the infamous '''"[[The Anarchist Cookbook]]"'''.  Having this textfile made you an instant [[internet tough guy]] as well as giving you a 20+ [[ego]] boost.  With the anarchist's cookbook, you were unstoppable! Classmates and the police cowered in your shining knowledge of how to [[pyro|blow shit up]] and whip up homemade drugs. This was originally translated from the [[IRL]] book of the same name by a [[13 year old boy]]; nothing could have possibly gone wrong with this interpretation.  Every other textfile afterwards were either one of the trillion variations on the original, school pranks, and/or other useless [[faggotry]].

==Textfiles Today==
The textfiles of the old internet are still circulated to this day by such sites as [[Totse]] and [[Bombshock]], but [[noone]] really cares.  Most textfiles nowadays are [[GameFAQs|videogame walkthroughs for fucking retards]].  The problem with internet users today, is that they all have [[ADD]] and consider textfiles [[TL;DR]].  The solution?  Create small snippets of the original anarchist cookbook, put them all on a distribution site with a network of [[13 year old boy]]s.  This solution was the site called: [[RottenEggs]].

Textfiles are also used to make read-mes,which come as a [[rape|surprise bonus]] with every single program ever. Contrary to the name, nobody ever reads them.

==textfiles.com==

'''textfiles.com''' is a website that lets people born after 1975 experience the glory days of [[shit nobody cares about|BBS culture]]. An archive of (wait for it) text files written by [[basement-dwelling]] 13-year-olds, Textfiles is the first place you should look if you want to build a [[Islam|bomb]] [http://www.textfiles.com/anarchy/toliet.bomb], commit [[Identity theft|credit card fraud]] [http://www.textfiles.com/anarchy/CARDING/], [[raep|seduce]] a [[furry|girl]] [http://www.textfiles.com/100/lay-girl.txt], or burn down your middle school. Of course, if you want to do any of these things ''[[Fail|successfully]]'', you might be advised to look elsewhere.
