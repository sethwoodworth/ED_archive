So you've just joined an [[Online Roleplaying]] site, and you want people to pay attention to you and your [[shit|unique]] [[mary-sue|character]]. What do you do? The best way to keep other [[basement-dwellers|roleplayers]] from ignoring you is to choose a play-by for your character. Play-bys take an [[pointless|eccentric but benign]] activity and turn it into something very, very [[creepy]]. Play-bys are solid evidence for the [[truth|theory]] that people roleplay to escape their pathetic lives. 

==What are Play-Bys?==
Play-bys are [[internet model|models]], [[celebrities]], [[hipsters]], and [[animals|scene kids]] that [[losers|roleplayers]] use to physically represent their characters. Many roleplay sites require members to have play-bys while also listing a 'no perfect characters' rule, making them giant [[hypocrites]]. Once a roleplayer selects a play-by for her character, she will mine the internets for photographs of that particular person and [[molest]] them with [[photoshop|grunge brushes]], [[evanescence|song lyrics]], and [[trying too hard|whatever pretentious character name the roleplayer dug out of babynames.com]]. Said roleplayer will post the play-by on her character's profile, and [[16-year-old girls|all of the other site's members]] will ooh and aah over how sexy and cool the character looks. [[some argue|Many internet scholars theorize]] that the attractiveness of a roleplayer is inversely proportional to the attractiveness of her average character, which means that sites that require or encourage play-bys are overloaded with some of the [[fugly|ugliest women on the planet]].

==Why So Creepy?==
Most roleplay sites are escapist traps, which means that their members force their creations to do everything that they can't do in real life. [[virgins|Roleplayers]] make their characters [[fuck|have sex]], [[outside|go outside]], and even [[friends|socialize with other people]]. Many roleplayers have [[faggot|gay]] and [[mental illness]] fetishes and create schizophrenic pretty-boy characters with horrific pasts. Imagine accidentally stumbling onto a [[high school]] roleplay site only to find some fatty using your pictures to represent a character who is [[assrape|plowing some man in a back alley]]. While play-by supporters argue that most people would be flattered to see their pictures being used, anybody without [[insanity|delusional disorder]] knows that all but the most [[desperate]] of [[attention whores]] would be horrified to find people associating them with such twisted faggotry.

==Play-By Drama==
Play-Bys are a massive source of drama in the places that use them. Most roleplays have 'face claim' boards where grubby-fingered roleplayers fight over the celebrities and models they so desperately want to be. A [[newfag|newcomer to a particular site]] may become butthurt if her favorite [[faggot|scene king's]] likeness is already being used. Meanwhile, the debate of [[snca|allow play-bys vs. ban play-bys]] rages on in the greater roleplay community. Some [[rational]] people have banned play-bys from their sites altogether on the grounds that it violates the 'no perfect characters' rule, while [[fugly|others]] support play-bys on the grounds that they act as a visual [[aids]] for their characters. The real reason that they support play-bys, [[obvious|of course]], is because they prefer pictures to go along with their textual masturbation-fodder.

==Play-Bys and You==
If [[YOU|you]] ever come across a roleplay site that encourages play-by use, here is what you can do:
*Laugh at all the members for being incredibly [[ugly]]
*Try to contact the individuals whose pictures are being used and notify them that their pictures were stolen
*[[troll|Educate the members about the implications of using somebody's image to enact your fantasies]]
*[[Get Out|Exit the site]]
