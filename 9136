'''Woom''' is a mini-meme spawned [[last thursday]] on /[[x]]/. While [[some argue]] it was forced, most agree that it has reached short-term memedom thanks to its rather large amounts of concentrated [[win]]. Originally a [[typo]] of "took", it has since been used in a variety of meanings, although most still have something to do with the word "take". Along with its meme-counterpart ''good job kid, hang in their'', it was created in a thread supposed to be about watching people die (a [[typical|common topic]] on /x/). The thread, however, was ruined when various /b/tards invaded and made fun of the typo while unknowingly generating the aforementioned win.

==The original post==

{{quote|im in the british ta. one of my squad was killed during a skirmish. it was horrible, also lasted quite a while. as we were scouting out the local area a small bomb went off after one off us had obviously stepped on the trip wire. he was hit by a piece of shrapnel which took most of his body with it. the worst part was when you looked at his face just before he went, he had this horrified knowing look. not as if he was in pain but like he knew what death looked like and...it was horrible. it woom about 10 minutes for him to fully pass away|the guy from the british ta|on wooming about 10 minutes to fully pass away.}}

==Variations==
Mostly revolving around the change of the subject of the killing, these variations are what makes woom so good (or so bad).

{{quote|im a piece of shrapnel. one of my squad was killed during a skirmish. it was horrible, also lasted quite a while. as we were blowing out the local area a small soldier went off after one off us had obviously stepped on the trip wire. he was hit by a piece of soldier which took most of his body with it. the worst part was when you looked at his face just before he went, he had this horrified knowing look. not as if he was in pain but like he knew what death looked like and... it was horrible. it woom about 10 minutes for him to fully pass away|Anonymous}}

{{quote|im that guy's squad member. i was killed in a skirmish. it was horrible, also lasted quite a while. as we were scouting out the local area a small bomb went off after one I had obviously stepped on the trip wire. I was hit by a piece of shrapnel which took most of my body with it. the worst part was when this faggot looked at my face just before I went, I had this horrified knowing look because I'd just realized the guy would never know that he was a faggot. not as if I was in pain but like I knew what death looked like and... it was horrible. it woom about 10 minutes for me to fully pass away|Anonymous}}

{{quote|So I'm a bomb, and this idiot soldier comes along and tramples all over my tripwire. Naturally, I blow up all over his ass, and this huge fucking piece of shrapnel flies towards him. Before he got bulldozed by it, I see him sharing an intimate glance with some other retard soldier who he's clearly butt buddies with.

Anyway after the shrapnel woom his life, the Taliban arrived and said to me "Good job kid, hang in their"|Anonymous|[[Meme Combining|crossbreeding memes]].}}

{{quote|So I'm a trip wire. Figures that the ONE NIGHT I finally hook up with this hot bomb, this idiot soldier comes along and tramples all over me. Naturally, my bitch blew up all over his ass, and this huge fucking piece of shrapnel flies towards him. Before he got bulldozed by it, I see him sharing an intimate glance with some other retard soldier who he's clearly butt buddies with.

Anyway after the shrapnel woom his life, the Taliban arrived and said to me "Good job kid, hang in their"

It sucked. I had my thumb all the way up that bomb's ass.|Anonymous}}
