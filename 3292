'''George Carlin''' <s>is</s> was a prophetic comedian whose [[common knowledge|original]] and [[AIDS|powerful]] [[swearing|insights]] about his [[America|country]] and about [[mundane|humanity]] made him [[an hero|a hero]] in the eyes of [[angst|angsty]] [[13-year-old boys]], [[Rational Response Squad|raging atheists]], decrepit old [[hippy|hippies]], and every other creature [[Evolution|God ever created]]. Being a raging atheist himself, he liked to [[troll]] his audience by asking [[Allah|God]] to [http://www.rense.com/general69/obj.htm "strike them dead."] One of his most famous acts, "[[swearing|Seven Dirty Words]]," cemented itself in [[American]] popular culture as a masterpiece, likely due to the fact that 'Murikans have a very limited vocabulary, and [[derp|clapped like retarded seals]] when Carlin said a no-no. Nonetheless, Carlin managed to piss off a lot intellectual [[elitist]] faggots by being a bigger intellectual elitist [[faggot]], and that's all a guy could ever hope to accomplish.

In keeping with the rest of Carlin's acts, [http://www.habitablezone.com/flame/messages/420992.html his views on the environment] are good for much lulz - on account that they would cause every piece of filth Commie in the audience to [[explode|spontaneously combust]].  

George Carlin, a die-hard atheist, was [[permaban|smitten by the angry hand of God]] on June 22, 2008.

[[Shit nobody cares about|'''Note:''']]  [[Some argue|Some argue]] that The Seven Dirty Words bit is frighteningly similar to a lot of Lenny Bruce's material in the mid-1960s (primarily due to the fact that they both used naughtynaughtynaughty words. And if you swear in your comedy routine you're automatically ripping off Lenny Bruce), back when people thought Bruce wearing a bathrobe onstage was [[batshit]] insane.

After Bruce died, when suspected of borrowing someone's act, Carlin would say he was "carrying on the tradition" or "carrying the torch" which was his way of saying [[Win|"Fuck him, finders keepers!"]]. 

==Life==
[[Image:Carlin.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[censorship|SHIT PISS FUCK CUNT COCKSUCKER MOTHERFUCKER TITS]]]]
Even though he was born and raised in <s>West Philadelphia</s> [[New York|Jew York]], he was actually [[Irish|Irish]]-[[Americunt|American]], which made all of his [[Kramer|race commentary]] completely [[racist]]. He attended a [[Catholic]] school, but later became an outspoken [[atheist]], after reaching the age of reason, which made him a lot more [[angry]], prone to drug use, and explosively violent.

Despite his anger and cynicism towards [[The Man|society]], he always considered himself a "[[pussy|personal optimist]]," i.e. a happy family man. However, his [[whore|wife]] [[death|died]] rather early, making him an [[dying alone|eligible bachelor]].  Since then he has put out [[at least 100|10 or more]] HBO specials and had more heart attacks than [[Dick Cheney|Cheney]] (drugs [[R. Lee Ermey|fuck you up]]) and still couldn't become a more modern version of Lenny Bruce or Richard Pryor because, well, [[Snob|he did way too many HBO specials]].

==Mindfucks==
George Carlin was the master of mindfucking, a practice dating back to the earliest [[anal|annals]] of human history. His brand is a very placid form of trolling.

==Concerned about the White Man==

In seeming contradiction to most of his material regarding [[white people]], when asked via a telephone interview how he felt about bad things happening around the world, he said he wished he could witness three [[lies|indisputable facts]] often parroted by right-wing pundits, such as the rise of [[Russia]] and [[China]], the [[Islam|Muslimization]] of [[Europe]], and in his own words, "the decline of the [[white|white race]]."  Note he said white race and not just white people, leading to the inescapable conclusion that George was telling whites to stop dancing like [[blacks]] because he realized it'd lead them to chucking spears and living in huts.
