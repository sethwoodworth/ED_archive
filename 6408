{{pixplz}}

[[Image:Picture 2.png|thumb|right|the only way to talk to girls online.]] Standard response to anything possibly even vaguely suggestive, or possible even vaguely related to the human body, by sexually-frustrated [[Internets]] users with no imagination (in other words, your average [[Encyclopaedia Dramatica]] reader, or any Internets user who is in it for more than just [[eBay]] and knitting groups on [[Yahoo!]])

Witness:
 [[Ohbutyouwillpet]]: So the other day I was fucking this two-month-old...
 [[Ed Rodriguez]]: Pictures plz

Compare:
 [[Mediacrat]]: So the other day I got this hangnail shaped like [[Brotney Spears]]...
 [[Nickolaus |Nicky the Goth]]: Pictures plz

[[Image:Pictures Pls.jpg|thumb|right|Sometimes it's best not to know]]The curious thing about the use of "pictures plz" is that there are already [[at least 100 years ago|at least 100]] more readily-available nekkid pictures of people on the [[Internets]] than there are human beings on the planet, and many of them are of people far, far more attractive than the recipient of the request.

== How to Request Pix on ED ==

# Insert {{tname|pixplz}} at the top of an article or if an article could use multiple things, use something like <nowiki>{{needsmore|pics and internets}}</nowiki>.
# Bask in the glory of knowing that your desperate request will probably be ignored by the greater ED community. 

If you want to increase your [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]] [[Karma]], however, [[Google]] up some pix for the pages listed here: [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Pixpls]]
