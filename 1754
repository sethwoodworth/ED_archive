Is a television show from the bowels of the internet. About a [[batshit]] vietnamese [[loli]] named Thu Tran and her talking [[dildo|food]], the show is mostly about [[drugs|really wild colors]] and Thu [[unfunny|staring awkwardly]] at the camera. Your enjoyment of these precious moments is dependant on how many drugs you happen to have taken in the previous year.

==Creation==
After dropping out of art school, Thu wanted to a healthy life balance of working a dead end job as a barista and [[amateur porn|playing with puppets on camera.]] After years she finally managed to create 6 half hour episodes for youtube, which caught the eye of the AFC and is now a syndicated late night show. Munchies ensued.
