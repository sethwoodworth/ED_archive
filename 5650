=== Smoking a Dimebag ===

In the evening of December 8th 2004, at a [[Damageplan]] concert in [[Columbus]] [[Ohio]], Gale stormed the stage with a Beretta 92 [[gun|pistol]] and opened fire, killing Dimebag. Following this, Gale turned the gun on those who were rushing the front, in an attempt to stop him. He shot and [[Banned IRL|killed]] audience member Nathan Bray and club employee Erin Halk as well as Jeff "[[Buttsecs|Mayhem]]" Thompson, a member of the band's security entourage. He also wounded the band's tour manager Chris Jew and drum technician John "[[I told u I was hardcore|HARDCORE]]" Brooks. 

Columbus police officer James [[lulz|Niggemeyer]], responded by firing his weapon, a police issue shotgun. Gale was physically bitchslapped by [[Bel-Air|'bout 7 or 8]] buckshot pellets, all hitting him in the [[Shotgun mouthwash|face]]. Officer [[lulz|Niggemeyer]], was reassured by a [[Damageplan]] roadie who told him "[[You win the prize|You just became a hero nao]]. You saved lives."
