Your resistance only makes my penis harder!

[[Meme]] from the 5-episode hentai series ''Words Worth'', featuring a [[furry|half-human, half-horse]] character named Stallion who, in a shocking twist for the genre, [[rape]]s female prisoners who are blatantly [[asking for it]]. His catch phrase, "Your resistance only makes my penis harder," quickly evolved into a [[meme]]. Unfortunately, the English translation of this phrase goes "The more you fight, the more excited I get!", which is clearly not as funny.
