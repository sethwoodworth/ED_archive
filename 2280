'''Disconnection''' is a practice in [[Scientology]], in which a Scientologist severs all ties between themselves and friends, colleagues, or family members that are deemed to be [[Marcabs|antagonistic towards Scientology]]. For example, most '''SP'''s (suppressive people) are disconnected from after they asked "..why is there a volcano on the cover of [[Dianetics]]?" or said something like "Dudes, I heard Scientology is a scam."

This is what happens to [[gentiles]] when the Jews who run the phone company, the cable company, the Department of Water and Power and <u>especially</u> the [[gas company]] [[pwn]] you when you don't give them their monthly [[jew gold]]. This kind of '''disconnection''' will also cause you to lose contact with your friends and family but -at the end of the day- is way worse than getting cut off from your loser parents and siblings.
