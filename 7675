Do you remember the story of [[Yaminoeyes]], the anorexic manbeast who thought she was going to sell Final Fantasy VII BACK to Squaresoft?  They said it could never be trumped.  Call the man from the Guinness Book Of Lulz, though, because '''Sonmanic''' has come up with the goods.  An [[Aspie|aspiring]] [[Unrealistic_expectations|film director]] from Pleasant Hills, California, he is a confirmed furry, infantilist, diaperfur, camwhore, attention whore, con artist, video pirate, thief, liar, crybaby and emo.  He's also [[portal|not very likable]].

He plans on letting none of this detract from his master plan: [[LOL WUT|To single-handedly reinvent the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise without Sega's permission, grinding anyone useful or talented underfoot along the way while complaining bitterly about how jealous a community is of his talent and how ungrateful they are for his hard work.]]  Anyone would think that Sonmanic is a [[batshit]] insane 13-year-old girl upon first meeting him — he is, in fact, a 29-year-old man.

==Drama on FUS==

===Backstory : Ali [[Bawww]]-[[Bawww]] and the Forty Alts===

[[Image:Sonmanic-DiCLetter2.jpg|thumb|DiC pwns Sonmanic.]]
It all began [[At least 100 years ago|in 2002]] on a ''Sonic cartoon'' fansite, [http://www.sonicsatam.com/ Fans United for SatAM (FUS)], when he was caught [[piracy|bootlegging]]; to wit, using eBay to sell low-quality SatAM episodes and free fansubs of Sonic X. Previously he had made a name for himself in the community by [[stalking|contacting]] DiC and [[shit|Sega]] trying to get them to air [[Shit_no_one_cares_about|their fucking show again]].  So like any other humble, hardworking [[Weeaboo|fanboy]], he threw a royal [[butthurt|bitchfit]], whining about how ungrateful and unappreciative the community was, and [[stripper|ANYWAY, HE NEEDED THE MONEY TO GET THROUGH COLLEGE!]]  After [[OVER_9000|a dozen or so]] tantrums, the community got tired of having to deal with his shit, and decided to [[kline|ban]] him.

After his initial ban, Sonmanic, being the [[downs|clever little man]] that he is, created [[Sock puppet|alt]] after alt pretending to be someone else, getting caught, [[Waaaambulance|asking why he was banned]] and then getting banned yet again.  It was already clear that he was a [[Basement_dweller|busy man]] with a [[Masturbation|full life and schedule]], but eventually the ritual became so well-worn that a special banned usergroup (entitled "Sonmanic is a [[Faggot|loser]]") was created for the sole purpose of sticking him and his alternate accounts in.  He was also caught a second time bootlegging Sonic cartoons, only this time promptly getting [[Owned|served]] with a cease-and-desist order from DiC themselves which shut down his [[honest]] business practices for good.

Fast-forward a couple of years. Sonmanic manages to contact the owner of FUS, Quexinos, then known as Sonique.  After hours of what can only have been him RolePlaying as someone from Kingdom Hearts, since that's all she cares about, along with much e-fellatio and brown-nosing, Sonique makes the [[Retard|smart]] decision to let the [[fucktard]] back into the community.  The stage was thus set for massive [[faggotry]] and [[lulz]].

[[Image:Sonmanic-LoserGroup.jpg|left|thumb|Truly... an achievement to be proud of!]]
While records on the forum of his Sonic cartoon piracy and ban-jumping have been lost to the sands of time, the 'Sonmanic is a Loser' group remains as a stubborn testimony to his stubborn testicleheadedness (one which Sonique was willing to ignore if it can get her more Sonmanic cock).

===Make Way for the Self-Proclaimed King===
[[Image:Nomovie.gif|thumb|Even Quexinos is sick of it.  White Knight fail.]]
As soon as he was allowed back into FUS, Sonmanic began [[TL;DR|yammering on]] about how [[lie|he had been commissioned by SEGA]] to produce [[DO_NOT_WANT|a feature-length Sonic movie]].  When in fact, he had done nothing more than commission a few [[Tartlet]]s to draw the character sheets for him.  Later investigation with the tartlets involved revealed that his "Commission" process actually involved little more than whining at them for a really, really long time.  He also enjoyed harassing several SEGA employees about the idea.  One, tired of dealing with the [[retard]] mentioned Sonmanic's [[Shit_no_one_cares_about|movie idea]] on one of his visits to Japan.  This was the response he sent to our brilliant [[furry]] friend:

''I just returned from Japan and we did discussed the [[Crap|Sonic movie]], either for theatrical release or straight to DVD. Sega Japan is considering several options on how to [[Kill|develop]] a Sonic movie or new TV show and it's a decision that will [[Irony|not be made quickly]]. They do feel that a new project should be developed in the [[The_Jewnited_States_of_Americunts|West]] as Sonic is considered a Western property; it's never been that popular in [[Japan]].  However, they have placed your idea in the [[fail|pre-green lit stage]] until you can submit the [[Lies|details]] regarding your place in this project.

''In order for them to seriously consider a proposal for Sonic, they will need information on [[DevianTART|you and your group]], [[FanFiction.Net|what experience or background you have]], what approach you would take (2-D vs 3-D, storyline, etc.), financials on the production, [[Internet_money|what financing you have]], [[Internet_celebrity|who would do the production]], production timeline, possible [[Basement_dweller|voice talent]], and any details to give them a complete picture of your group and your expertise.''

''I realize that's a lot to put together, but they tend to ask for a lot of information and take a long time to make a decision. Good luck!''

''Regards''

Upon being told this very statement, Sonmanic shit his diapers and began parading around claiming that SEGA had "pre green lit" his movie not stopping when anyone tried to talk sense into him, or even when his [[Fuck_buddy|good friend]] Quexinos turned against him. It took SEGA themselves to get him to STFU.


''I was contacted by our European office as they recently came across [http://www.animationforum.net/forum/showthread.php?t=1726 http://www.animationforum.net/forum/showthread.php?t=1726] and your own website [http://www.rkdezignz.com/ http://www.rkdezignz.com/]. I just want to make it clear that Sega has not “relinquished legal consent” to you in any way to [[Fail|pursue the production of a Sonic movie]] and it’s not appropriate for you to suggest that Sega has done so. We have merely spoken about your interest in securing financing and producing a Sonic movie. [[Pwnt|You cannot represent yourself as the Sega sanctioned producer of a Sonic movie]]. I want you to correct this situation immediately on both the animation forum and on your website and in any either forum where you have posted. [[Stfu|This is not acceptable]].''

''[[Loser|As you have yet to even submit a proposal]], we are far away from any production of a Sonic movie.''

After being throughly [[Pwnt|pwnd]] by [[Sega]] themselves, it was the last anyone had to hear of his [[bullshit]] for a while.  That is, until [[Christmas]] Eve.

===I Saw Bullshit Come Sailing In, On Christmas Day, On Christmas Day===
[[Image:Sonmanic-FishingForPity.jpg|thumb|[[TL;DR]] : Sonmanic is [[sad]].]]
On Christmas Eve 2007, Sonmanic announced the [[Awesome|terrible]] news that his team had been [[Pwnt|rejected]] by SEGA in favor of an [[Chasethehedgehog|undisclosed third party]]. He made sure to express how [[Butthurt|depressed]] he was over the matter.

{{quote|In other words, game over for me and the arduous journey that I've traveled in the last 2 years. So I guess, be happy that a Sonic movie is happening? I dont know, Im really depressed|Sonmanic|Fishing for [[Hugbox|pity]].}}

[[Image:Sonmanic-RobotnikRip.jpg|thumb|left|Cionex's design (left), compared to Sonmanic's released character sheet of Robotnik (right). The resemblance is uncanny.]]
The FUS members were initially [[Hugbox|sympathetic]] towards his plight; that is, until he released the concept art that he had begged from his lackeys. One artist, by the name of [http://lockon.deviantart.com/ Cionex], came forward and claimed that the design for one of Sonmanic's character sheets was quite similar to a design he had been using in one of his projects and posted a side-by-side comparison. 

True to Sonmanic's [[honest]] character, he vehemently denied having any prior knowledge to Cionex's design idea.  This set warning lights flashing, as Sonmanic was clearly visible lurking around an earlier thread in which Cionex posted his designs. When presented with this [[Phoenix Wright|crucial contradiction in his testimony,]] he immediately changed gears and pointed the [[Cock|finger]] at his hench-tartlet [http://rogferraz.deviantart.com/ Rogferraz], his character sheet artist: his unshakable arrogance left him in no doubt that Rog would take the fall for him.

As can be seen by the court, Rog wasn't as stupid as he looked.

[[Image:Sonmanic-RipThreadRogsTestimony.jpg|center|600px]]

Having had his own team bare to the world that he had instructed them to copy the designs of others right from the start, any doubts in the minds of FUS members that he was a lying [[Plagiarism|plagiarist]] were chased away like ants before a vacuum cleaner (or furries before a carpet-bombing).

Of course, never one to admit his mistakes or fuckups, he immediately dug around his ass desperately for an excuse.  The best he then came up with is [[Bullshit|"I honestly forgot!"]] Which, even by his own hallowed standards, was frankly [[lol|laughable]].  All though lying is nothing new for him as Sonmanic was apparently [[pwnt|abused]] as a child and only lies because [[sob_story|he's afraid of getting hit.]]

===[[kline|Banned]] for good===

[[Image:Sonmanic-RipThreadFinalMoments3Banhammered.jpg|thumb|...and then there was much rejoicing.]]
Fortunately for the community, FUS soon after came under the management of people who were not too wrapped up in [[masturbating]] to [[Kingdom_Hearts|Kingdom Hearts Yaoi]] and constant [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Sonicrazy.jpg attention whoring] (Seriously [[WTF]]?) and could make reasonable decisions. RockyRaccoon & Sonicus Prime, having their [[bullshit]] quota already filled to the brim, decided that Sonmanic's shit was more work than they were prepared to weather. For the next several days his bawling sockpuppets assaulted the castle walls, before all being detected and banned as well.

[[Image:Sonmanic-DAWhiningAboutFUS.png|thumb|left|Because running to another community to play the victim automatically makes you innocent, amirite?]]
The whole thing was taken to the next level of [[Lulz|hilarity]] when Rocky made a public post on the site frontpage announcing Sonmanic's ban for [[plagiarism]]. This triggered a major shitstorm on Sonmanic's DA page as he tearfully protested his innocence.  The post and journal have since been taken down but a screencap of the journal was taken, thus preserving the lulz for posterity.

==Gimme Shelter==

[[Image:Sonmanic-SMS1Butthurt.jpg|thumb|right|Sonmanic, being [[butthurt]] as usual.]]
Next, Sonmanic [[hugbox|took refuge]] in another Sonic community, [http://www.saturdaymorningsonic.com/ Saturday Morning Sonic], the owner of which had [[orly|witnessed]] Sonmanic's outing but was retarded enough to take him in with open legs. It was later found out that the owner (PorpoiseMuffins, seriously, what the fuck kind of retarded name is that?) was his [[lie|butt buddy]] which put [[OVER_9000|one or two]] things into perspective.

His first act was to [[Waaaambulance|whine and bitch]] about how [[Awesome|malicious, stubborn, close-minded and unforgiving]] FUS members were. Sonicus Prime decided to register on SMS as InstrumentOfDestruction and call Sonmanic on his [[bullshit]], and much [[lulz]] were to be had until PorpoiseFuckmuppet [[Administrator|locked the topic]] in a desperate bid to <s>derail the lollercoaster</s> stop the [[retard|retarded]] [[flame war]].

</gallery>

===Damage Control; Also, Cocks===

A couple of weeks later, PorpoiseManfaggot decided to [[Nobody_cares|"Interview" Sonmanic]] about his [[Wank|involvement]] in the Sonic [[fandom]].  The interview is little more than a [[Felching|gratuitous session of him lapping up Sonmanic's bullshit]] compiled into a failed damage-control article for Sonmanic to whore around in order to assert his non-existent credibility.

===I Think SEGA Is A Pretty Racist Guy===

[[Image:Sonmanic-SMS2LollercaustStarted.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lollercaust]] started!]]
[[Image:Sonmanic-SMS2NoGettingOverIt.jpg|thumb|Several months later and he still can't get over not having the attention and praise he wanted.]]
There was then a period of relative calm from Sonmanic that lasted a few months.  This led everyone to believe that he might just have [[STFU|fucked off]] from the [[internet]] and everyone could forget about him.  He was, in fact, busy sinking his claws into Sonic fans who were [[Nest Of Vipers|naive]] enough to take him at face value.  [[Detective|Investigation into the matter]] revealed that he was poised to use their pet projects as springboards to launch himself into the fanfame he so [[desperate]]ly fapped over.  Predictably (and as usual), he fucked up and gave himself away as the lying, deceptive scumbag that he is AGAIN.

Eventually, Sonmanic was fired a [[gay|friendly]] warning that any further faggotry from him would result in [[faggotry|this article being written.]]  As you can surely guess, the warning was clearly [[Ignored|not heeded]].  Instead of deciding to grow a pair and [[An Hero|fuck off for good]], he decided to make another pity-party post on SMS about how the Sonic fandom is filled with [[Furries|horrible people]] and how he never gets the respect and gratitude that he "deserves."

At this point, your humble author and another person involved decided to come to the topic to clear things up and reveal the truth of the matter.  This inspired a lot more [[faggotry]] from Sonmanic, until PorpoiseMongler got [[rage|pissed]] and made a post that can only be translated to [[Chris Crocker|"BAWWWW LEAVE SONMANIC ALONE!"]] and [[Nobody_cares|"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN HIM WITH ED!"]]  During the course of the thread, Sonmanic played the [[Race Card]] on SEGA of Japan for rejecting his Sonic movie proposals.  He claimed that SEGA of Japan rejected his proposal because he is a [[Weeaboo|gaijin]] rather than the fact that the script he wrote for said proposal is pretty much just another fanfic that sucked ass.

Image:Sonmanic-SMS2LeavingAgain2.jpg|...and another!
Image:Sonmanic-SMS2LeavingAgain3RaceCard1.jpg|...and yet another! The author wonders if Sonmanic realizes that if he makes post after post threatening to leave, and then never follow through, nobody is going to take him seriously.  At this point, Sonmanic decides to play the [[Race Card]] to excuse why his proposal is rejected.

Image:Sonmanic-SMS2PorpoiseCrocker.jpg|LEAVE MY[[Butt buddy|BUTT BUDDY]] ALONE!11
</gallery>
</center>

This bloomed into a beautiful rose of lulz in a later thread, in which Sonmanic reported that his second attempt at pitching his shitty-ass script to SEGA of Japan resulted in still more [[fail]].  Not only did he accuse SEGA of Japan of being xenophobic, he threatened to drop dox on the SEGA employees involved and attempted to rally the Sonicfags at SMS to [[spam]] their inboxes. Predictably, his attempt to turn SMS into his [[personal army]] failed miserably.

==Sonmanic the Amazing Adult Baby==

Lulz were already raining from the heavens by this point, but then out of nowhere the discovery of his [[Sick_fuck|diaper fetish]] came like the big cream cake that drops down at the end of a screen of Bubble Bobble.  <s>[http://www.diaperspace.com/babychipmunk His profile on Diaperspace]</s> is a horrifying look at how deeply his [[fetish]] for shitting his adult diapers runs.  This profile has since been [[baleet|baleeted]].  However, images from his profile, as well as blog screenshots, have been archived for posterity (and to frighten small children and the elderly).

UPDATE: Despite the incredible risks, Sonmanic has created a new Diaperspace profile, [http://www.diaperspace.com/videos/id_5910/title_extended-play/ and this time, there are videos.] Hurry and watch them for epic lulz before he wises up and deletes this one too.

==OK Cupid Fail==

[[Image:Sonmanic-OKCupidValentines.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Lolcow|hilarious]] journal post whining about the evils of Valentine's Day.]]

As anyone could have guessed, Sonmanic is also single, [[so ronery]] and [[desperate]] to find a mate. In fact, he's been a member of OK Cupid since 2004 and is still single. Get him while he's hot, ladies! How is it possible that a [[unemployed|self-employed]], backstabbing, video-game obsessed babyfur could go without a girlfriend for so long? Check out [http://www.okcupid.com/profile/sonmanic his OKCupid ad] ACCOUNT DELETED. and find out! He naturally conceals his sick [[furry]] perversions from potential mates.

==Myspace==

His faggotry can also be found within the putrid depths of [[emo]][[fag]] that is [[MySpace]].  Here are some examples of his blogs wherein he yammers on about [[Shit nobody cares about|his involvement with the Sonic fandom]].

==Other faggotry==

When he isn't repeatedly ban-jumping message boards for an old cartoon, or shitting his adult diapers to get off, he can be found furiously [[masturbating]] to pictures of Princess Sally from said programs.

Sonmanic has an odd [[obsession]] with the character of Princess Sally from the Saturday Morning Sonic the [[lol]]hog cartoon, he spent over $500 on a plush doll of the character and rarely passes up an opportunity to mention that fact (as a true testament to his devotion) or post pictures of himself with said cumrag.

[[Image:Sonmanic_so_worth_it.png]]

==The Next Project==

After SEGA rejected Sonmanic's [[Shit|brilliant]] script, he decided to teach SEGA a lesson for their racism in the most hilariously pathetic way possible.  That's right, he was going to heroically make a film, starring their intellectual property, without their consent, and with no funding.  [[Sarcasm|That'll show'em!]]

Anyone who has read the aforementioned script, whose brilliance was such that he refused to alter it, will know that it would be payback indeed. Fortunately, you can't, because the link we had on before is as dead as his brain.

===Donation Drive===

Of course, prices of baby powder and wet-wipes being what they are, Sonmanic couldn't afford fantardery and obsession of [[OVER_9000|this magnitude]] alone.  Thus, he began begging for donations to fund his life's vision; [[Awesome|a movie about a small blue rodent that runs really fast]]... even though hedgehogs are insectivores, not rodents.

Things were about to backfire REALLY badly.

Part of his plan involved hiring the artists who helped him to draw the character sheets for his previously failed fan project. Yes, the VERY PEOPLE he'd tried to shit on in order to clear his name. As if this weren't proof enough of his [[fucktard|magnificent intellect]], he actually '''forgot that he had promised them payment for the last project'''. Needless to say, the artists gave a big fat "NO" this time around and so he is stuck looking for unsuspecting artists who previously had not been acquainted with him or his thieving faggotry.

===Sonmanic Made A Bad Future In Act 1===

TLDR: the artists involved who were never paid decided to [[Internet lawsuit|threaten to tip SEGA off]] to his current operation for lulz in lieu of payment if he did not pony up.  The immediate response from this sad [[Diaperfur|diaper-soiling]] fuck was to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|hurriedly take down all traces of his operation from his blogs]].  As you can tell from this article, the internet [[never forget]]s.

Desperate for praise, he decided to spread his faggotry and [[AIDS]] to the Nintendo fandom by anonymously tipping off a Nintendo fan blog to his own failed project.  As you can see from [http://gonintendo.com/?p=45213 this] blog entry, Sonmanic (aknotholeresident in this case) will still not tell the truth about his plagiarism.  He insists on coming up with [[bullshit|story after story]] blaming everyone else but himself, this time reaching a new level of [[asshole|assholery]] actually <B>trying to pin the blame on the artist he tried to rip off.</B>  Fortunately after Cionex came in there and told the truth of the matter, the baby fur fag actually shut the fuck up for once.  This might just be the most attention he will get in his [[pathetic]], miserable life.

Teh ironiez.

===Desperate last ditch attempt to molest real artists via craigslist===

In May of 2008, a craigslist ad appeared titled "Calling all 2D animators".  In sonmanic-language this means, "furfag wants to shit up your inbox with pitiful ploy to get you to work on his sadfag fanmovie".  This led to lols from the unsuspecting artists who replied to the ad and got sonmanic's form letter, then discovered this ED page. 

sonmanic's form letter:

<pre>
After combing through your resume, you certainly seem like an appropriate match for this project.  Your resume certainly has an
impressive track record ensuring that the quality of your work will reflect in this animated film.  I also noticed that your
proficient in (REDACTED) which is another position I need to fill.  So heres the elaborate details regarding the concept.
 
I'm in search for animators to assist me in producing a 2D animated feature for a fan-made internet distribution.  This
will be a non-profitable film that involves no physical release, but only through download or stream via Newgrounds or Atom
Films. I feel this method will usher in a new era of film as its currently doing for the music industry.  Before I
begin, I would like to give you a more insight on my background. By introduction, my name is sonmanic; writer and
film maker from the SF Bay Area in addition to being a long time fan of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. I’m anxious
to deliver a proposal that will sure to turn heads at your headquarters.  I want to entertain the idea for a SONIC THE
HEDGEHOG feature film that I have been developing for the last 3 years.  

What’s the current status?  Character model sheets have been designed, and treatment, a trilogy outline and a 2nd
draft script has been written.  As a multitalented artist in the entertainment industry and veteran Sonic fan, I've
dedicated my life in one day contributing to this popular video game franchise.  Here’s a brief layout of my vision.
The film will borrow an array of elements from the Sonic buffet including the comics, video games, tv shows (90s ver), and
something new to the table. It will deliver massive appeal to Sonic fans worldwide and a general audience by telling
an original; cohesive story.  

By using this formula, it would avoid alienating the fan base by incorporating everything associated with Sonic from his
17+ year career into an epic, adventurous trilogy.  Plus the purpose of this film would tie together multiple continuities,
bring back elements from the past, refine the Sonic universe, and give the characters real personality, emotion,
and widespread appeal. This could have an incredible effect on his worldwide image and popularity, and set the whole
franchise on a new course in a positive way.  The goal for this film is to aim for a 2011 release date to coincide with
the 20th Anniversary of SONIC THE HEDGEHOG; delivering that nostalgic experience to the audience from when they first picked
up a Sega Genesis in 1991.  Though if the production is completed early, it wouldn't harm anything.  

We live in a fascinating and an endearing era where nostalgia has become the new trend in reviving old franchises such
as TMNT, Transformers, Alvin in the Chipmunks, and Speed Racer which seems to capture that childlike innocence in today’s
movie goers.  With the addition of Spyro the Dragon, Castlevania, Earthworm Jim, Prince of Persia and other upcoming
game-to-theatrical releases, Sonic would defiantly satisfy.  I will certainly compensate you for your time and cooperation in
producing this epic masterpiece.  Is there a ball park figure you can lay out for me?

The materials are all laid on the table; it just needs the right people to create something way past cool!  I appreciate your
time in considering the proposal, a pleasure making your acquaintance, and I look forward to your reply.

Best,

sonmanic, Writer/Director

</pre>

sonmanic's sadfag attempt to hype himself screams "wannabe", as do his egotistical delusions of being a "film maker", "director", owner of a "design firm", "artist", etc.  Trying to sucker real professionals into taking him seriously makes him a [[shit|piece of shit]], and makes them want to beat him like a red-headed stepchild.

===Panhandling fail===

Most inept of all is the way sonmanic earns the "wannabe" title with his own shitty presentation on the front page of his website.  The first thing any visitor will see is a "paypal donation" button.  (Do real artists pay their bills by begging on the internet instead of getting paid for their art?)  This makes sonmanic [[loser|more lazy and less successful than junkie trash who go outside and panhandle in public]].

'''Update, January 25, 2009:'''  Sonmanic's head is still so firmly wedged up his soggy-diapered pooper, that he is STILL spamming craigslist with sadfag panhandling beggary for donations to make his wannabe "movie".  So what if brown people die in Darfur, this genius has a better cause!!   Dipshit.  Dipshit.  Dipshit.  Get off the internet.   

<pre>
Seeking donations to help fund an animated fan film

I'm a writer/director seeking donations or someone willing to invest in a non-proft animated feature fan film 
I've been developing for 4 years. I specialize in graphic design, video production, screenplay writing, and 
visual FX. Pre-production has been completed and we require the funds to proceed with the animation phase. Listed 
below is what I have completed thus far:

-Character Model Sheets
-Concept Art
-Backgrounds
-Storyboards
-4th Draft Script
-Voice Recordings

This epic adventure will chronicle the journeys of a young hero who rises up to power in conquering his 
mental/physical demons while overcoming his obstacles and eventually defeating his malicious adversary. The style
of animation will be 2D handdrawn implemented with CGI FX, harkening to the classic era of Disney films of the 
90s. In addition, we're launching a viral marketing campaign to hype the film while its in production. Elaborate
details of the film will be disclose upon response. I'm really passionate about this film considering that I've 
invested my time and money into the pre-production stage and its been idly sitting around for a couple months now.


If you'd like to see a sample of the animation, you can view it at - (REDACTED, the demo reel of a poor sap.) -  
I'm planning on having 8 animators involved with this project including myself. This 
includes 2 keyframers, 2 tweeners, 2 background artists, and 2 3d artists. The studio we're collaborating with 
has been very generous and shares the same emphatic zeal in delivering a modern animated classic that I can 
confidently attest will be nothing short of awesome. The amount required to procede with the animation phase is 
$9,000. I really appreciate your financial assistance and hope my talented group of artists can finally proceed 
with the animation. With all the dedication and passionate people aboard this project, it would really mean a lot 
to me if we can finally get this film produced. The motivation is fueled inside me and I'm willing to do anything 
to get it made. I have recently set up a paypal account so I can recieve donations. If you have questions, feel 
free to ask. Id be more than happy to expound on the premise of the film and the struggles and sacrifices 
regarding its development. Thanks for your time and charity!

Best,

Sonmanic </pre>

==They're Coming To Take Me Away, Ha Ha==

During the creation of this article, our friend Sonmanic decided to inform us that after a full year and a half he still has not gotten over being banned from a message board based around a cartoon show.  In a hilarious e-mail that was sent to FUS admin RockyRaccoon, Sonmanic whined '''yet again''' about the hostility in the Sonic fandom which he is mysteriously unable to avoid and warned how SEGA and FUS will come to [[Troll's Remorse|regret]] rejecting him from their communities.

Realizing that the day was pretty much lost, he proceeded to swear revenge on SEGA's evil conspiracy to make Sonic products without his involvement and vowed never to stop until he got his [[shit|epic vision]] made into film. In closing, the Sonic community [[penis envy|envies him]] because he "accomplished so much" while the rest "have a few cracks in their foundations that have yet to be fixed."

[[Image:Sonmanic-MailedToRocky.jpg|center|BAAWWWingest email ever written.]]


[[Image:Sonmanic-IRCInvasion.jpg|thumb|Like a lost dog, Sonmanic always comes back. Unlike a lost dog, Sonmanic isn't wanted.]]
As you can see, Sonmanic means [[The Internet is serious business|SRS BIZNS]].  According to him, [http://www.dailymotion.com/playlist/xu6kd_EinFahrenderRitter_sonmanic-interviews-himself recording oneself for twenty minutes] [[wank]]ing about their own [[lie|tall tales]] of achievements in a Sonic fandom is ttly contributing guise.  As if that wasn't hilarious enough, you can find him obsessively joining the IRC chatroom on FUS.

==Another Board Another Life==

[[Image:Sonmanic-richardkuta.jpg|left|thumb|Screencap from Sonmanic's camwhore diary of [[epic fail]] ]]In June of 2007, Sonmanic nearly made meme status when could no longer take the taunting of a local Weezer fanboard troll and decided it was time to let everyone know what he thought of the whole group.

===Sir Sonmanic Addresses His Public===

He posted a video to his youtube account in the style of one of his other lame internet heroes, the [[Irate_Gamer|Irate Gamer]], with such classic lines as:

*"Are you shitting up my ASS?!?"
*"[[Internet tough guy|And this is a gay man, you'd better we don't confront each other in a dark alley one day because you'll find yourself on the ground. I'm dead serious]]"
*In a moment of self-referential irony, "IT'S THE GODDAMN INTERNET, NOT THE WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA!"
*"I FUCKING RESIGN FROM YOUR SHITTY ASS COMMUNITY!"  What, again?

Sadly, after being linked on Digg and who even knows what other corners of the internets, perhaps realizing his poor judgment, he removed the video. Then in another ironic twist, this bootlegger had remixes and reposts of his video removed from the internet for copyright violations. Unfortunately for Sonmanic, videos like these never get completely removed from the internet.

<center><youtube>lmNL6Yb2BQo</youtube></center>

===Department of Internet Accounts, Protocols, Evaluations and Reprimand===

[[Image:Kuta_diaper_logo.jpg|thumb| Sonmanic [[retard|didn't realize]] this spelled out DIAPER for almost an entire week.]]
After an intense phone conversation, Sonmanic was convinced he was being hacked/spied on by someone in England. Sonmanic  then received a mysterious e-mail from "Mark Jackson" of the "Department of Internet Accounts, Protocols, Evaluations and Reprimand," a supposed government anti-online bullying organization so secret, they don't even have a website.

For almost an entire week, Sonmanic began his pursuit to "officially shut down" the Weezernation message board. However, his crusade with "Mark Jackson" came to complete halt after Sonmanic discovered this government agency had a questionably hilarious acronym referencing his past interests.

==Save Sonic Stupidity==
Somewhere in 2007, our fellow shithead decided to try another Sonic forum. This time, it was http://savesonic.all-up.com/forum.htm, a shitty board that is dedicated trying to get Ryan Drummond, Sonic's awful voice actor from 1998-2005 to voice the series again. ''([[Spax3]] used to run the place, so that should say enough about it)''. Sonmanic promised everyone that he would make a Sonic movie, but to appeal to the Save Sonicfags, he said that Ryan Drummond would voice act in it. Everyone except for like three people believed him. Seriously Faggy, an admin, read his "script", and [[facepalm|said it was the best he ever seen.]]

However, Quexinos, the same dumb bitch who jills off to [[Do_not_want|One Piece/Kingdom Hearts yaoi]], found out about Sonmanic's plans, and made a [[tl;dr]] post about how he is a lying piece of [[shit]].  She was banned moments later, as Save Sonic will ban anyone for anything. However, Sonmanic left Save Sonic shortly after Quexinos called him out. Coincidence? I think not!

==Game Over for Sonmanic==
[[Image:Sonmanic-SegaRestrainingOrder.jpg|thumb|left| Christmas comes early! ]]
Even SEGA got so fed up with Sonmanic and his constant harassment with his [[stupid|inane]] and [[vapid twat]] proposals of a Sonic movie that they sent him a formal letter telling him to fuck off or get [[legal_action|sued]]. Apparently, he [[retard|didn't get the message]] the first time they rejected him and kept hammering them with his proposals.  As if getting rejected for the billionth time wasn't funny enough, he actually took it upon himself to [[wtf|record himself opening up the rejection letter]]. 

This can mean two things, either Sonmanic is no longer able to inflict to the world his painfully [[stupid]] ideas regarding [[Sonic]], hopefully becoming [[an hero]] as a result. Or, he will try something stupid and [[illegal|drastic]], getting himself [[party_van|V&]]. Either way, it would most likely mean more [[lulz]] for the masses.

Unfortunately, later on, after discovering that his latest failure came to light on ED. Sonmanic has deleted the video in question and pointed the blame squarely onto Sonique (Apparently [[User:Shishikabob|Shishikabob]] on ED) for the creation of this section. 

{{quote|It makes me question our recently amended friendship. [[Sob_story|You betrayed my trust]], [[Hitler|you are the epitome of evil]] and now it will be impossible for me to forgive you for this malice behavior.|Sonmanic|Spilling his impotent nerd rage}} 

In addition, Sonmanic, who has been obsessively stalking this page all this time, flew off the fucking handle as this section is being expanded. Delivering yet another "Fuck you! I'm leaving the fandom!" rant and pointing the [[cock|finger]] of blame at the dumb [[cunt]] Sonique. Sonmanic proves that he can still be milked for the lulz even a year after the article's initial creation. This makes [[at least 100]] "leaving the fandom, back in 5 mins" rants that he has made to this day and he shows no sign of stopping.

[[Image:Sonmanic-PointingFingers.jpg|thumb|center|Yeah....I lost count too.]]

==Doctor Sonmanic's Stunning Diagnosis!==
Sonmanic even got banned from Saturday Morning Sonic forums.  The [[white knight]] PorpoiseMuffins, sick of his manipulation and bullshit, laid down the banhammer.

After [[bullshit|promising to change]] yet AGAIN, and [[lulz|being told to fuck off]] yet AGAIN, he decided to [[facepalm|leave the fandom]], yet AGAIN!  He decided the best course of action would be to [[Harassment|IM]] his good friend Quexinos and [[shit_no_one_cares_about|pass along the message to her.]]  After baaawing for a while, he finally came to the [[stupid|amazing]] conclusion that all [[Sonic]] fans, and all of his [[everyone|enemies]], [[WTF|must have autism]] and that's why he can't fit in anywhere.  

{{quote|just remember Nique, [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|all I wanted to do with help but you and other Sonic fans got the wrong idea]]... cause im the only one that doesnt have some type of mental disorder like autism which sadly most Sonic fans have|Sonmanic making a stunning diagnosis.  Full conversation can be read [[Sonmanic/IMs|here]]. }} 

This gives doctors around the world a new test for [[Autistic|autism]]: if you aren't Sonmanic but you are on the Saturday Morning Sonic forums, you are autistic.

==The Quest For Attention Continues==
Not one to give up after being repeatedly banned and emasculated in front of his peers, Sonmaniac decided to plague another forum with his butthurt.  He hoped that perhaps the Sonic fans at ScrewAttack would want to get in on the cock sucking fest that is his project.  He proceeded to upload several YouTube videos showing his "progress".

These appear as if they have been ripped out of SatAM and the Sonic Movie.  He even claims in his intro to have permission from Sega of America (see cease and desist order above).  Will he have his asshole ripped open by DIC and Sega again?  Only time will tell.

'''Update:''' In a recent bid for sympathy and perhaps a realization of [[fail]], Sonmanic has declared that he might make his movie with [[flash]]. Despite the fact that this is clearly him trying to get out of doing IRL work, 98% of people on SMS continue to suck his e-penis and are convinced that this shitty fanfic will revive the whole fucking series and give them new Princess Sally porn to [[fap]] to. 

'''Update 2:''' He has uploaded a new [[shit|trailer]] on Youtube that strings together what he had posted before. [[Truth|This trailer is probably the total of his work over the years]] since it makes no fucking sense, shows no sign of a plot, and looks like something that was left in Sonmanic's diaper.

<center><youtube>J_baYPQxT-s</youtube></center>

'''Update 3:'''
*[http://forums.sega.com/showpost.php?p=5336592&postcount=508 Sonmanic quits the project.] [[Image:Sonmanic-Swan-Song.png|thumb|left|This "swan" has sung many times before.]] 

=== Quitting the fanbase forever! ===
[[Image:Sonmanic-quits-again.png|thumb|Prank calls are such [[serious_business|serious business]] to Sonmanic, that quits his [[shit|fan film]] again.]] [[Image:Sonmanic_My_Father_picked_pussy_over_me.png|thumb|left|Sonmanic entertains a forum with tales of his personal life (yet again) ]]

After bitching about how no one cares about his attempt to revive [[Shit nobody cares about|a children cartoon from 10 years ago]], Sonmanic has decided to quit the fanbase again. He screams that the fanbase no longer cares about the "TRUE" Sonic from the 90's and therefore does not deserve it. That and how no one has given him a large sum of cash to shit in his diapers with. So with relatively little effort from the trolls, the three people out of his two man fanbase caused Sonmanic to kill his dreams...'''again.'''

=== A 15 Year Old Makes Sonmanic Cry ===

Recently, [[tssz|TSSZ news]], who keeps fans up to date on the latest [[drama|Sonic news]] did an [[shit_no_one_cares_about|exclusive]] on our furry [[fag|friend]] and revealed the [[gay|real]] reason Sonmanic had to quit the project.  Apparently, a [[wtf|15 year old]] was [[lie|harassing]], [[bullshit|stalking]] and [[lulz|prank calling his family.]]  He decided the [[dumbass|best course of action]] would be to quit his project yet again, to keep his family safe from the danger that is 15 year old boys.  Although, not much is known on the [[evil]] 15 year old except that he has a phone that he uses to prank families with.  One would advice those out there to stay inside, buy some [[curtains]], and purchase a [[dog]] to keep the life threatening juvenile away.  But be warned, he is known to be sexually explicit when calling and chances are, he has no life.  

Sobmanic on the other hand, as per usual is now spending his time, [[Waaambulance|whining and crying]] to every Sonic site that hasn't ousted him yet about how immature the fandom is and warning them to stay away from deadly 15 year olds.  His recent plea for attention is located [http://www.tssznews.com/2009/10/28/exclusive-kuta-says-harassment-not-legal-hurdles-derailed-fan-film/ here]. Trolling is encouraged.

==Sonmanic vs Green Eyed Sonic==
In early 2010, the [[babyfur]] reached a whole new level of pathetic when the trailer for Sonic The Hedgehog 4 was released. Sonmanic's response? A 360 degree bitchfit. The cause? Sonic having green eyes. That's right. He started a flamewar over [[Shit nobody cares about|the eye color of a cartoonish videogame hedgehog]]. For some reason six seconds of game footage left Sonmanic [[butthurt|wailing that Sega has betrayed him]]. He treats the absence of the 16-bit Sonic sprite [[gay|as if he's just been dumped by his boyfriend]]. Theres a thread of over 9000 posts of Sonmanic's [[Waaaambulance|endless whining and crying]] non-stop about how "Sonic 4 doesn't belong in this world!!!" and how Sega doesn't care about him. [[Truth|Well, his own family doesn't]], so why should the people who sent him a restraining order?

[[Image:Sonmanicwhine.PNG|left]]

[[Image:SonmanicSONIC4butthurt.PNG|right|thumb|You do not want to see what he does with that doll when the camera's off...]] 

He also made another video starring the sick little diaperfur [[adult baby|cuddling his Sonic doll]] and then going into [[over 9000| his 9002nd]] "BAWW! SEGA DOSEN'T CARE ABOUT [[oldfag|OLD FANS!!!]]" rant, ending with (of course) "[[NO U|FUCK YOU]] SEGA!!! I'M [[quitting IRC forever|QUITTING THE FRANCHIZE!!]]" Like we haven't heard that one before...

<center><youtube>-DMtSDDF2Do</youtube></center>

Oh, and it didn't stop there. Two more rant videos followed, with a truely AWESOME string of comments and video responses from Youtubers telling him to fuck off and/or grow up. Butthurt once again, he deleted the videos, leaving this message.

[[Image:Sonmanic_Kool.png|center]]

Apparently, anyone who doesn't think [[Shit nobody cares about|Sonic's eye color]] is [[serious business|a matter not to be taken lightly]] (for example EVERYBODY) is a retard without an opinion of their own. Sore loser much? Altogether, these things solidified his position as the single most hated person in the [[shit no one cares about|Sonic The Hedgehog fanbase]].He later faked an apology [[camwhore|via yet another video]], only to later prove himself unable to stop whining about his obsession for the 16 bit Sonic.

When Sonic the Hedgehog 4 was finally released, Sonmanic decided to try and get the [[Attention whore|acclaim he so desperately wants]] by making a review. Claiming this to be "[[Unwarranted_Self_Importance|the review the fanbase has been waiting for!]]". Of course, he lied about the whole thing. He still hates the game. Then again, Sonic is produced by those mean people who wouldn't make [[Shit nobody cares about|his fanfic]] into a cinema-release feature film and pay him lots of money for it, so once again, he thinks that his childhood has been raped.

===He is not Eggman!===

As if the big bitchfit he threw over Sonic's eyes wasn't enough, Sonmanic then started [[Bawww|crying]] about [[Shit nobody cares about|Eggman not being called Robotnik anymore.]]

<gallery>

Image:Lerpalerpa.png|[[Wat|He also determined that the Sonic games sold so well in America due to Eggman's name being  Robotnik.]]

</gallery>

===I'm a Knight In Shining Armor because I whine about videogames!===

Sonmanic's next claim to lame was stating that [[LOL_WUT|only the brave and wise complain about the Sonic series]]. He claims that anyone who likes any Sonic game released after Sonic & Knuckles is a cowardly fool, [[Unwarranted_self-importance| and that he himself is a wise couragous soul]] for acting as though everything Sega does is an afront to his childhood.

{{quote|I think so much damage has been done from Sega and the fan base in the last decade that it will take years to rectify the franchise to its glory. The problem is that the next gen fans essentially control the communities and they refuse to research Sonic's past cause they always say "times have changed, move on." Plus while the old school fans try to encourage the younger fans to at least read the comics, watch SatAM or play the old games, they of course gloss over them and assume were retro purists. That's not it at all. We just care about GOOD material. Then these morons think demanding for quality products is considered pretentious. I feel like I'm in that movie Idiocracy where the future is full of lazy, apathetic retards that live in their filth and blindly accept crap. If people aren't courageous enough to call Sega out on their BS, that's where we're headed. The games will continue their downward slope cause nobody was either brave or smart enough to acknowledge the imperfections.|Sonmanic|Whining as usual.}}

===Sonmanic "quits" the Sonic fanbase in 2010===

[[TL;DR|Long story short]], after making a huge [[Attention_Whore|drama-filled]] exit, he returned about 3 weeks later. Realizing that without making a [[fanfic|fan film]] devoted to a blue anamorphic hedgehog, [[Fact|his life has no purpose]]

==Sonmanic Is Up for Adoption==

Once again showcasing his epic case of [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|Unwarranted Self-Importance]], Sonmanic has now put [[LOL_WUT|himself up for adoption.]] Unlike most adults who would lower their standards and take any job that pays until they can get back on their feet, Sonmanic has instead opted to [[Fail|beg random strangers on the internet for housing.]] But not just any stranger will do, [[Unrealistic_Expectations|they must be female, and they must be willing to not only partake in his diaper fetish, but pay all his living expenses]] as well. [[NO|Sounds like a fair deal right?]] At this point in his life, Sonmanic should seriously consider joining the [[Scientology|Sea Org.]] They will give him shelter for one billion years and [[Truth|he's already got many of the qualities]] that they look for in members.

Image:Sonmanic-beg.png|It seems his standard of [[Ugly|adorable is a little different]] to everyone elses.

In the end, he went back to live with his mother. There goes his fantasy of having a mommy he can fuck. [[Incest|Or does it...?]]

==Sonic Fan Film: The Faggotry Strikes Back==

[[Attention Whore|Never one to give up on his endless quest to be the center of attention]], our least favourite furfag returned to working on his beloved fanfilm, having finally found an animation studio, that will animate his fanfic and still let him take all the credit for their work. [[Image:Sonmanic_Devotee_Verbal_Fellatio.png|thumb|center|Sonmanic's [[White_knight|devotee]] engaging in some verbal [[fellatio]] (deep throat style).]]

===The Fundraiser of Fail Returns===

Of course, since animating an hour and a half of Sonic-Shit takes time, the animators in question needed to be  compensated for their trouble. So, Sonmaic, thinking that no one would turn down such a [[Sarcasm|noble cause]], decided to beg stangers on the net for the cash. Yes, he actually believes that very same people he denounced as "Sega Kool-aid drinkers" will fund his movie.

Warning, high levels of pretentious nonsense.

==Sonmanic Sinks to a Whole New Level of Low==

This entry could have been a sub-section of Sonic Fan Film-Faggotry, but the unforgivable nature of what Sonmanic did next merits its own section. 

On August 31st, the Sonic fandom learned that Ben Hurst, chief writer for season 2 of the SatAM Sonic cartoon and one of Sonmanic's many harassment victims, had passed away. Sonmanic, being the selfish little fucktard that he is, saw it as an opportunity to advertise [[Shit|his precious movie]]. [[Attention whore|He tried to advertise the fanfilm in the thread, where the news was announced]], claiming that his fan wank movie [[Lie|will be dedicated to Ben Hurst's memory]]. Then he announced the same thing on his movie's donation page, thinking that if he dedicates his [[Shit|crappy fanfic]] to Hurst, fans will think him [[An hero|heroic]], and pay to get it animated.

{{quote|Furthernote, Im dedicating [[Shit nobody cares about|this project]] to the loving memory of Ben Hurst; writer of the SatAM cartoon show. He was a continuing source of inspiration [[Irony|growing up]] and the reason [[Unrealistic Expectations|I wanted to pursue animation and multimedia]]. Even though he never saw his Sonic movie come to fruition, [[Unrealistic_expectations|I feel that the torch has been passed to me in order to complete his unfinished tasks.]]|Sonmanic|crossing the line.}}

==Sonmanic's Unemployable==

{{quote|Because of all this drama she caused, shes the reason why Im not socially acceptable or and why I'm rejected from job opportunities.|Sonmanic|His evaluation of why he's an unemployable outcast from society}}

Apparently he has been having some problems finding friends, or a job. The reason for this is the forum drama caused by Sonique. Not the bootlegging, his compulsive lying (or "forgetfulness" as he puts it), his ridiculously unprofessional behavior, his temper tantrums, his posting of private communications between himself and Sega employees, his receipt of a cease and desist order for harassment of Sega employees, his self-confessed harassment of a cartoon writer whose death he then tried to use to promote his film, the accusations of racism he made against Sega, his intention to use somebody else's intellectual property without permission, his panhandling, his copyright infringement, the fact he posed as an officially sanctioned producer of Sonic media, or his mass-sending of unsolicited messages to artists asking for their help while posing as such. And it ''definitely'' isn't the smell of baby powder and stale urine that accompanies his job applications.

==Sonmanic Eyes become Green with Envy==

Upon discovering that not only did someone else have [[Sarcasm|the nerve]] to make a Sonic fan film of their own, but they dared to get Jaleel White on board to voice Sonic, [[Waaaambulance|Sonmanic burst into tears]] and his [[Faggot|boyfriend Nicochi]] burst into [[Butthurt|narcissistic rage]], trying to [[LOL WUT|put down the competition]], so that people will donate their money to Sonmanic's <s>diaper fund</s> [[Shit|movie]] instead.

== Reflections of a Wannabe Hipster ==

How could this happen to [[attention_whore|Sonmanic]]? He's made his mistakes, got nowhere to run... 
Oh wait, this isn't a video by [[emo|Simple Plan]]. Although after watching this video, one can see why that's an [[truth|easy mistake to make]]. <center><youtube>c-4Gn53PZ6g</youtube></center>

This video is a wonderful mix of delusions, whining, and contradictions. One would think that if [[attention_whore|Sonmanic]] was tired of being [[Owned|lectured]] he would [[GTFO|leave the internet]]. But seeing as how his [[USI|massive ego]] needs constant praise from people [[pedo|half his age]] this is very unlikely to happen. Hopefully Sonmanic will at least be able to afford some [[truth|shampoo that he desperately needs]] soon. 


==Closing Notes==
[[Image:Sonmanic_photoshop_party.jpg|left|thumb| Some images speak for themselves.]]
Sonmanic is a [[pathetic]], [[Retard|socially-broken]], [[Scat|shit-eating]] [[babyfur]] with [[White knight|followers]] who either have fallen for his lies, or who simply don't care and hope his ectopic community fame will rub off on them like the musty smell of spunksocks.

He is also part of the reason why Encyclopedia Dramatica exists in the first place.  Or rather, people like him. Every corner of the internet has a [[Lolcow|special somebody]] in the [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|community's history]], that sooner or later, it's not going to be easy to tell [[Noob|the younger generations]] their story again and again before the [[Lolcow|somebody]] can get to them. And so, it is our sworn duty to retell their tale for all to hear. It's kind of like the very end of ''James And The Giant Peach''. But with more hatred.{{clear}}
