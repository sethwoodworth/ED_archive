Once known as one of the coolest [[vandal]]s since [[Willy on Wheels]], [[Grawp]] has since turned into one of the biggest [[lolcow]]s since [[Sceptre]]. As Grawp, he doesn't want you to know that he was also known as '''JarlaxleArtemis'''Jew, also known as [[Jeremy David Hanson]]. Why? According to [[Wikipedos]], it's because Grawp originally had an account in which he made many productive edits to [[Wikipedia]]. JarlaxleArtemis is currently an administrator on the Info[[Anarchy]] wiki, a site sponsored by [[Erik MÃ¶ller]] of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].

{{quote|Isn't it [[ironic]] that JA/[[Grawp|G]] went to [[ED]] to rag on [[Wikipedia]], and then managed to [[troll|piss off]] everyone over there? You'd think that eventually he'd realize the problem is him, not the administrators of every website he ever visits.|[[NawlinWiki]] (talk) 12:20, 26 March 2009 (UTC)}}

The degradation from his plastic surgeries have resulted in people comparing it to when he dressed as an [[undead]] [[zombie]] in his Thriller music video."

It is actually biased by being neutral (bet that's something you've never heard before ;). Michael Jackson is so strange and so freakish that ''not'' being neutral about him is biased."

[[It was a social experiment|For reasons that are unclear]], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User%3AJarlaxleArtemis] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cyde/Archive014&diff=prev&oldid=76308864] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cyde/Archive014&diff=prev&oldid=76309355], he got into a fight with the [[bureaucratic fucks]] of Wikipedia. This resulted in his [[lulz]]y revenge campaign against [[Linuxbeak]], in which he vandalized nonstop while impersonating Linuxbeak. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/JarlaxleArtemis] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/JarlaxleArtemis_2] [[Blu Aardvark]] once got in a fight with some administrators and initially went on a much smaller vandalism campaign anyway (not the large one later) and he was never allowed back. But Jarl, after just a couple of months, was welcomed back into the fold. Why? Because he's one of [[The Wikipedia Jews]].

While using good-hand accounts, he snuck back with bad-hand accounts and eventually got banned. Normally he'd melt into the crowd, but he was notable because his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Long-term_abuse/JarlaxleArtemis long term abuse page] was packed full of his [[dox]]: his first, last and middle names, his high school, birth date, parents' names, social security number and even more personal information on its subject than [[Chris-chan]]'s biography.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Long_term_abuse/JarlaxleArtemis&diff=97260527&oldid=96355958]  Wikipedos ignored his attempts to get rid of it, but they later deleted it because [[Wikipedia Review]] spotted it and then Daniel Brandt used it to justify his compilations of dox on all the administrators he didn't like.

Jarl then came to ED, but did not fit in because he is a Jew.

[[Image:Toygoy.jpg|thumb|right|JarlaxleArtemis (left) with his gentile <s>pal</s> enemy ByAppointmentTo (right) in [[at least 100 years|thirty-five years' time]]. [[NawlinWiki]], not shown, is still getting trolled.]]
He then seemingly left TOW, ED, etc. Everyone thought he left to play more [[Dungeons & Dragons|Forgotten Realms]] and spend his [[Jew gold]] to buy a [[boyfriend-free girl]] via [[Russia]]n mail-order. Instead, he was now [[Grawp]].

A year and a half later, a terribly obvious impostor called [[Wikipedia:Special:Contributions/Mister_Jarlaxle|"Mister Jarlaxle"]] vandalized two people's userpages and suddenly Krimpet [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=&user=Krimpet&page=Wikipedia%3ALong+term+abuse%2FJarlaxleArtemis restored the page] at the request of a Wikipedian called [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKrimpet&diff=195063787&oldid=195063488 Blueboy96]. Blueboy96 is a lovely admin who, when [[ByAppointmentTo]] complained on TOW about [[Alison]] spreading the Grawp-dox on ED, locked the talk page. Who was the impostor? [[NawlinWiki]] and [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Talk%3AGrawp&diff=1997696868&oldid=1997696746#Grawp_.3D_JarlaxleArtemis.3F some others] were the first to discover that JarlaxleArtemis and [[Grawp]] were the same person, so someone in the know wanted to trick them to get the page back. It was baleeted ''[[at least 100|yet again]]'' by Krimpet, then arch-enemy [[Alison]] would [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2008_October_11 ensure] that it stayed dead...for now.

What have we learned from the revelation that Grawp is secretly JarlaxleArtemis?
#Never trust a Jew; see the gallery above.
#[[Michael Jackson]] is a [[pedophile]] who masturbated with children.

==[[Holocaust|How do you solve a problem like Jeremy?]]==

[[Image:BRBFBI.jpg|thumb|The Allie-van is gonna get JA!]]
Whilst it is agreed that JarlaxleArtemis's trolling of the [[Wikipedos]] has been a source of [[epic lulz]] for at least the [[2008|past year]] or more, the userbases of both Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Dramatica have come to believe that he is [[trying too hard|just taking things too far, now]]. Not content with his pagemove vandalism, he also feels the need to make death threats towards [[Wikipedia admins]] by mobilising /[[b]]/ as his [[personal army]] to leave threats on Wikipedia sysops' user talk pages. Examples of these include the following:

*"I am going to saw off your head with a pocket knife. Then I will light your corpse afire and feed it to my dogs. After that, I will murder your entire family." [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Oxymoron83&limit=500&action=history]
*"I am going to rip off your tiny balls; then, I will decapitate you, you gay French faggot." [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lucasbfr&limit=500&action=history]
*"I will have your heart fed to dogs and shat out for my amusement. I will then have your obsequious brain torn from your foul head so that I can use your empty skull as a piss pot." [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:East718&limit=500&action=history]
*"Hey, bitch, I know where you work and live. Let's just say you should keep a close eye on your children. I am going to rape your children and mutilate their dead bodies." [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alison&diff=245182429&oldid=245182216][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alison&diff=252319598&oldid=252316463]
*"Hey, [name removed], age [age removed], of [company name removed] on [address removed], you animal fucker, I am going to slay you. You are a censorship scum. All Wikipedia administrators should have their identities exposed. You are a piece of shit who doesn't deserve to live. In fact, you deserve worse than death. I will have you horribly tortured before I finally kill you. How does stripping off your skin square inch by square inch sound?" [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=281912446#Death_threats_with_personal_info_by_.28now-blocked.29_user_Idearange123]

Now that the [[Abuse filter]] has been installed, he has dropped the Grawp persona and has taken to abusing the [[dox]] of both ED and [[TOW]] users, and making [[threats of violence]] as well as [[serious business|accusing these people of being child molesters and suchlike]]. He does this by creating large numbers of [[attack]] usernames in multiple user accounts all at once.

On the [[Wikipedia Review]], it was recently concluded that he suffers from a [[batshit insane|mental condition]] known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder antisocial personality disorder]. After all, he has a problem with [[Wikipedia admins|authority]] [[ED:SYSOP|figures]], [[CWC|doesn't succeed]] in [[buttsecks|interpersonal relationships]], becomes [[butthurt|aggressive]] towards everyone and everything that opposes him, [[USI|believes that he is a God-King of the Internet]] and cannot understand [[moralfag|the difference between right and wrong]].

He has also claimed to own a [[gun]] and not to be afraid of using it. Could he be the next [[Cho Seung-Hui]]? [[yes|Only time will tell]]...

{{quote|08:24, 16 April 2008 WÃ¦lgÃ¦st wÃ¦fre (talk contribs) moved Seung-Hui Cho to GRAWP THINK HE [[IDIFTL|DID IT FOR THE LULZ]]! â ([[for great justice]] and [[epic]] [[lulz]]; also, go to [[Last Measure|http://blocked.on.nimp.org]] [a must-see])|Grawp aka JarlaxleArtemis}}

If nothing is done to stop him, [[tabloid|news headlines]] may soon read, "[[Harry Potter]] killer commits biggest civilian massacre in US history."

==Doxing himself==
Back on Sep 7, 2005, he uploaded his name [[Jeremy Hanson]] in [[Lord of The Rings|Elvish]], proving that he is fluent in Tolkien's made-up language like those who speak [[Klingon]].  The image is below:

[[File:Jeremy Hanson in Tengwar Sindarin.png|center]]

Time passed and all the drama about him being banned as Jarl and then banned as [[Grawp]] from ED and Wikipedia.  And then him continuing to vandalize, [[dox]] drop, and issue death threats for years.  And all the calls to his mom and his mom denying it.  And him continuing his same behavior.

He'd uploaded this and other images of his real name in fictional languages long ago, marked them as [[Copyright|GFDL]] and then TOW marked as public domain because "[[TL;DR|This image consists entirely of a raster rendering (e.g. PNG) of characters from one or more typefaces. As such, it is ineligible for copyright in the United States and therefore is in the public domain. This does not apply to vector format images of fonts, such as SVG. Also, this may not apply in most jurisdictions outside of the United States.]]"

Eventually the first one in Elvish was found by [[google|googling]] ''"Jeremy Hanson" encyclopedia'' and uploaded to this article Feb 23, 2010.  On Feb 25, 2010, Jeremy started with sock puppet after sockpuppet trying to revoke the free license on his images as if he was [[Malber]].  He also did it to some images ED did not know about such as his name in [[Norway|Nordic runes]].  So we see he has doxed himself further with another image.  Thanks for exposing this other one too:

[[File:Jeremy Hanson in Futhark.jpg|center]]

TOW commons admins of course reverted him instantly and so he so eloquantly wrote, "I'M GOING TO SUE YOU, YOU NO-LIFE PIECE OF SHlT" to one of them.
