Jananaphone

{{lj|jananaphone}} is a miserable, disease-ridden [[LiveJournal]] [[fatty]], that is trying to drag the internet down with her into a dark swirling abyss of Twinkies and cheap [[vodka]].

For some reason unbeknownest to most functional human beings, Jana has managed to score herself a [[boyfriend]] that will only have sex with her when she is drunk. This fact did not however, stop her from viciously chewing on his penis as if it were a delicious juicy polish [[sausage]].

Jananaphone has high-risk HPV and frequently whines about it, often trying to shift the blame off of herself. She believes that because she used a [[condom]], it is completely not her fault that she has acquired HPV and thus should be pitied accordingly. However God did not make her fuck some random-ass guy at a highway rest stop, yet she does curse him nightly for it. She also tries to convince non-believers that they also have the disease, in a weak effort to make herself feel any less alone in this world.

Jana is also a closet [[lesbian]] and is majoring in [[Shit nobody cares about|Women's Health]] at [[College|Temple University]]. In her spare time, she likes to count her proliferating genital warts and in [[extreme]] cases of boredom, she likes to connect the warts with a Sharpie to make beautiful constellations.

She is rumored to potentially have up to 6 or 7 other [[STD]]s, but so far has not got around to [[bitch]]ing about them.

In a moment of irony her LJ motto"''Oh, there's nothing like emptying a cartridge at the sun,''" an activity almost as pointless as her life.
