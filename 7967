TG Comics
[[Image:wannaseeatrick.PNG|right|thumb|480x640px|I think I'll have to [[an hero|pass]].]]
'''[http://TGcomics.com TG Comics]''' is perhaps the most back asswards, sexually bizarre site this side of the [[internets]]. It reduces men to [[Internet_tough_guy|whining, borderline-retarded transexuals]] and women to [[whore|big-cunted vampire bitches]]. In light of this, most members and all artists fall into the [[batshit insane]] category.

'''Too Gay Comics''' revolves around the fantasy that women have perfect lives and [[USI|live on some enlightened ethereal plane]], high above the grasp of even the most accomplished men. This makes clear to [[rootbrian|anyone with at least one fucking brain]] cell that this [[uncyclopedia|shithole]] is a hub for those who want lopsided [[tits]] and a [[pussy]] that you can tell was originally a [[cock]], instead of a [[Penis|MIGHTY PENORS]]. The mindset of these 3D [[Hentai]] [[fags|flamers]] is that if a man was a woman, his life would be great. [[BAWWWWW|Gender identity crisis]] anyone? So, as [[you]] guessed, there's some [[transvestite|seriously fucked up shit here]].


==Premise==

The site's premise is that women are infinitely superior to men in their enlightened role as sex objects. Everything a woman experiences is pure matriarchal bliss, men only disposable tools her entitled destiny. The [[fags|men]] are accurately depicted as sex-starved imbeciles, and the [[lesbians|women]] and ex-men are glorified hedonists, happy to engage in such productive pursuits as:

:* Becoming a maid
:* Stripping
:* Prostitution
:* Becoming a vampire [[date rape|date rapist]]
:* One-Night Stands
:* Masturbation
:* Marrying a [[rich and beautiful|rich man]]

The comics, in a clever literary ploy unrivaled by Shakespeare, omit pesky plot or even filler in favor of a string of sex and masturbation scenes jimmied together with [[TL;DR|undeveloped dialogue]]. In short, [[99.9%]] of them are about a [[dude]] transforming into a [[chick]].
Then he buys shoes and pisses with his new vagina on the ground outside [[KFC]].
==Arrogance and Hypocrisy==

Like a tuberous heifer assuming all men unaroused by her "[[bitch|sassy]]" personality the smell of [[diabeetus|necrotic flesh]] are gay, TG Comics makes a few assumptions and derisions of its own.

TG Comics contains a mindful warning about the [[ocular rape|ocular penetration]] encompassed within. Some may find the presence of a "[[GTFO|decline]]" option redundant due to a convenient button located in the top left corner of most browsers.

The purpose of this an option is not to spare the user a few pixels to the left and up, but rather to arouse [[Nerd Rage|ire]].

Rather than redirecting the [[You|viewer]] back to whichever [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|dark site]] set him upon this abomination, the site redirects the user to [[Chick Tracts|Chick Cartoon Tracts]].

Does anyone uncomfortable with the material have a keen appreciation for Mr. [[woman|Chick]]'s work? Femur thinks so, whilst [[threesome|simultaneously]] deriding many [[truth|stereotypes]] about transsexuals.

==TG Comics is Obsolete==

Luckily, sites like TG Comics are a passing trend.

Technology such as this gives people a first-hand perspective of what day-to-day life as a woman is like. When I first tried it, I realized that this was the last time I went for less realistic alternatives like wearing my [[wat|sister's lingerie]].
