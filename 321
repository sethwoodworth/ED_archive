'''Alan [[MOAR|Moore]]''' is the author who wrote epic shit we all know about like:
*[[Gentlemen|League of Extraordinary Gentleman]]
*[[V for Vendetta]]
*[[Watchmen]]

As well as doing a bunch of notable comic book art like the [[Batman]] 'Killing [[Joker|Joke]]'. You should know who he is.

In 2009, London [[Anon]] member Drunk Jedi managed to corner Moore in Forbidden Planet and asked him how he felt about the [[EFG]] mask being used by various causes.

Being a gigantic egofag, Moore flounced self-importantly about how OBVIOUSLY he hates all the movies based on his work and '''weeps orphans' tears''' over every (or ever other) million dollars they make him, and how objectionable it was that [[Anon]] was using MOVIE LICENSED MERCHANDISE masks for their [[IRL]] raids.

What, does he want us all to look like [[New Zealand Fail Guy|this?]]

He did, however, admit pride at how his work had become a universally adopted symbol of the angry, anonymous body politic. This has been analysed by scientists at Lolledge U. as both unspeakably faggy, and kind of cool.
