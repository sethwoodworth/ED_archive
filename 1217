'''Bulletball''', or '''[[Atari|Pong]]''', is a gender and age neutral sport for the 21st century invented by [[homeless]] black person Marc Griffin. After 26 years of gameplay balancing, fine tuning and countless betas, Bulletball and Bulletball Extreme (also known as Professional Bulletball Extreme) is ready to take American living rooms by storm.

Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, Marc forgot to make his game fun and ended up [[batshit insane|selling his house, quitting his job, and hocking his '''wife's wedding ring''' to finance his "invention."]] Rather than give up in the face of common sense and [[Delete fucking everything|try to re-establish a life]], he's opted to sell his game to [[cripples]] and old folk. For the aspiring [[Special Olympics|athlete]], there's even a set of Bulletball and Bulletball Extreme branded sportswear and apparel available for order. Because in 100 years, when Marc Griffin is [[Lie|looking down from heaven]], he'll be smiling knowing that someone out there is taking this shit at least half-seriously.

==The Inventor==

Marc Griffin, average American everyman and inventor, seeking to introduce the world to the hardcore competition found in nursing homes decided to bring Bulletball and Bulletball Extreme in front of the panel judges of American Inventor.

Unfortunately for Marc, when his wife said "We're gonna need rules," she wasn't talking about the game. But the ever-ambitious [[Failure|inventor]], refusing to listen to common sense, decided that all his possessions and financial stability were getting in the way. So he sold everything except his '''OWN''' wedding ring and traded away his Saab for a 92 Volvo Wagon.

[[Failure|At least he still has Bulletball]].

It's Pong, except the ball rides the fucking rails. You also look like [http://youtube.com/watch?v=kvvyuoaER5Q a fucking retarded faggot] when you play. But don't let that stop you from trying, since Bulletball is also an intense [[Fat|workout]]:

{{quote|Are there any health benefits?
<BR>
BulletBall not only helps to strengthen your muscles, but it also helps as an excellent cardiovascular workout which increases your heart rate. In the gym it takes at least 4-5 days to work all the core muscle groups. Notice that after 10-15 minutes of playing, your hamstrings, quads, arms, and shoulders will be thoroughly worked while you have fun! BulletBall works your body and your mind and has been endorsed by professional athletes, physicians and the physically challenged because of its wheelchair friendly design. }}

Be sure to bring a bottle full of [[Jenkem|Vitamin Water]] to refresh those tired, aching muscles of yours.

Because playing Bulletball and Bulletball Extreme on anything EXCEPT Officially Licensed and Endorsed Bulletball and Bulletball Extreme Safety-Enhanced Handicapped Accessible Bulletball Tables is considered a gaffe in the professional circuit, you should consider investing in a fine construct such as the Bulletball Tabletop model, which folds up over your existing setup. The asking price for this incredible piece of machinery is a meager '''$79.99'''. But that shit is for [[noob|amateurs]], you see. If you wanna play with the big leagues, you're going to need to buy a real table:

[[Image:Bulletballtable3.jpg|thumb|right|A professional side-table too]]{{quote|The standard model BulletBall table is made of a white Â¾ inch Melamine top. The siderails attach to the side of the table and come standard with a choice of either one of the BulletBall logos (red, white, and blue or yellow, red and black). The American Flag is optional for an additional $20. The legs are available in the white, black, blue, green, and light maple wood grain finish.

Customizable logos on the siderails (see example above) are available for an additional cost.

The white top standard model table comes with hardware, 8 BulletBall balls, written instructions, DVD instructional video, and a certificate of authenticity. This table is available for a "limited time" reduced price of $299.99!!! plus shipping and handling.}}

The Bulletball Extreme table? '''$525.99'''

Might as well buy a [[Chadwardenn|PStriple]].
