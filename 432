'''Mychal Bell''' was a black person caught in a very [[ass rape|unfortunate situation]]. Having been carrying out his daily routine and duty to society as a black person by [[theft|shoplifting]], Bell hid from a couple [[fat]] rent-a-cops [[queening|underneath a car]]. When they found him, the ape started thrashing around, and hit one of the men. He was [[pwned|arrested]] and was taken to [[jail]]. After getting out on bail, he tried to become [[an hero]] because he knew he had been [[pwn]]t and would be publicly humiliated again (as if walking around in public being black isn't humiliating enough). To make matters worse, he had already been charged in the [[Jena Six]] beatings, and had already gone through [[lie|a horrific media ordeal]].

==The Name==

'''Mychal''' is [[Ebonics|niggerspeak]] for "Michael". Or maybe [[MTF|Michelle]]. Possibly even [[Mitchell Henderson|Mitchell]]. It has also been theorized that it means "My Child" ([mɑ tʃɑːl]). [[No one]] is really sure.

==The [[Fail]]ure==

Bell shot himself in the chest after he got back from jail. He was hoping to become [[an hero]], but [[fail]]ed since he used a [[shit]] gun. And he shot himself ''in the fucking chest, the retard''.

==Possible Outcomes==

Bell's condition is not currently known. This is likely because all the hospital staff know he has [[HIV]] from being a black person and are thus afraid to go near him. Thus, he is likely rotting in a hospital bed somewhere in [[Nawlins|Louisiana]]. Either that, or he is back in jail where he belongs, likely for trying to steal moar clothes, [[chikins]], [[watermelonz]], or [[nigga stole my bike|bikes]].

==Media [[Butthurt]]==

Since [[lie|society is so racist and unfair]], the [[leftard|good folks]] at [[Microsoft|MSN]] decided to front page this [[shit nobody cares about]] instead of focusing on the real news and issues, you know, like [[Sandalgate]].
