Turtleguy
[[Image:Turtleguy.jpg|right|thumb|The original image.]]

[[Last Thursday|This Thursday]], an somewhat ordinary, inane-looking thread appeared on [[b|/b/]]. It featured a picture of [[tard|some guy]] poking his head out of a giant turtle shell, with a classic, oh-so-[[exploitable]] look on his tan, wide-eyed face.

However, the image was found to be so win, and the expression so classic, that a [[lollercoaster]] was sparked, and no traditional [[forced meme|meme-forcing]] measures were even necessary. /b/ simply spat out new incarnations of "Turtleguy" at [[over 9000]] posts per minute, and he quickly achieved "/b/ gold" status in a single, highly-lulzworthy thread.

Since his appearance on the [[internets]] was so recent, he has not yet reached [[lulz|meme]] status, and his future is somewhat uncertain.
