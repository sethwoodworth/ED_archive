'''Messages''' are the official currency of [[MySpace]] and [[encyclopediadramatica|Gumdrop World]].  Getting a message makes everyone happy!

==Types of Messages==
There is only one type of message. It is called "[[flame]]". They typically mention the following things:
*Your [[homo]]sexuality;
*[[Your mother]]; and
*How you are going to get [[pwnt]] by an [[internet tough guy]].
*Installers

Flames are not to be taken seriously, because people on the [[internets]] aren't real, remember?

==Famous Messages==
* [[Guy Macon's original post]].
* [[Christian|Thou shalt ]][[rape|Love]][[Christian| thy neighbour]].
* [[Goatse]].
