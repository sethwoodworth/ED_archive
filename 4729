Lance "Carsello" Matthews is a [[Rap|rapper]]/[[scam]] artist with a [[Canada|Canadian]] tranny fetish. One can assume he developed this while serving two jail terms for fraud. Born 44 years ago because his black person didn't have the decency to pull out, he now resides in the Bronx, NY with his lonely mother (his brother Lamott Matthews is in jail currently). While pretending that he lives on the [[Jew_York_City|Upper West Side]] (87th and Columbus), Lance can be found fucking chicks with dicks. Despite being in jail twice, Carsello lives by the moniker "fake it until you make it". His angle is writing fraudulent checks to attempt to live his delusional dream life. Also, HE IS A FAT FUCK. REALLY FAT AND OLD. [[You]] can help by exposing this fat fuck and lulzing him out of hiding.

Carsello's most notable project is his [[Limp_Bizkit|Fred Durst]] wanna-be rap/rock persona known as '''Dilema'''. Since Carsello has spent so much time in jail, he has failed to realize that pop culture has moved on since the 90's. Moreover, for some reason, nobody has informed him that he has no talent and that he is just embarrassing himself. Yet, somehow, Carsello writes fake checks and gets musicians to collaborate on the sonic ear-rape that he unleashes upon the world.

Apparently, Carsello is not familiar with the [[Itunes]] Store. He constantly pimps his music on the ground-breaking web 1.0 site CD Baby. To this day he has only sold 18 albums and has less than 200 views on most of his laughably amateur Youtube videos, where he often resembles Carlton from the Fresh Prince - if Carlton was a [[Crystal_meth#Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] fiend.  With 18 albums sold, Carsello is now known as the only person to sell less albums than both [[Kevin_Federline|Kevin Federline]] and [[whore|Heidi Montag]].<br><br>

Carsello's current scam is an attempt to launch a 24 hour cable network. Basically, the shows looked like [[shit]] that wouldn't even get 200 views on Youtube (like his current Youtube videos) and Carsello. To this day, hasn't paid a single member of the staff. He has, however, written them fraudulent checks from 3 different overdrawn bank accounts.  

According to Carsello, FNN already has deals with Comcast, Century 21 stores, Macy's and Direct TV. In actuality, Carsello hasn't made a cent from FNN and has zero advertisers but still continues to pretend that everyone's big payday is coming. The hilarious part is that none of the footage he has recorded to date is usable due to not getting any waivers signed from the hosts and on camera talent and because he didn't pay the staff. There are also 4 [[lawlsuit]]s under way to derail Lance's opportunity to rip off even more people.

Regardless, Lance continues to [[lurk]] online and propagate his fake music for the masses.

==Joanna Hughes==

Two years ago, Carsello discovered a new way to scam himself some money. He found a young [[Tranny|transexual]] dancer, actor and writer named Joanna Hughes, from Ottawa, Canada. He got her to fund some of his bullshit projects in return for a green card marriage. Despite the fact that they are married, Carsello is constantly trying to fuck under 18 year old girls that he sneaks into clubs and is planning on divorcing Joanna in February after she officially gets her green card. You know what to do, [[internets]]:

<b>Report a fraudulent marriage to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (I.C.E.). Call I.C.E. at (866) 347-2423 with as much specific information as possible. </b>

Currently, Joanna (formerly "Joseph") is helping Lance with his long list of scams, which means her marriage is not the only law she is breaking. Joanna should realize that American prisons are not as cushy as those up north in Canada, eh? Not to mention Canada has an extradition treaty with the USA, in case <strike>s</strike>he decides to run back to mommy.
