==How to Win==
The photo with the most creative backgrounds and scenarios wins the prize. Photoshops are not allowed. This has to be photographic evidence of the ED logo actually existing in the scenario. [[Girlvinyl]] is the one and only judge of this contest. Three winners will be chosen to receive their choice of shirt from the [http://www.lollershop.com ED TShirt Shop]. Winners are responsible for paying postage. Prize is limited to stock on hand. Anyone is eligible to win. All entries must be posted by 5:00pm EDT, August 14th, 2009.

==Protip==
You'll want to do something really unusual and exciting. Have famous people hold the sign, put it on top of the Eiffel Tower, get [[Jimmy Wales]] to pose with it, have it printed on a cake, whatever. Figure out a way for it to blow people's minds.
