Moreschi
'''Moreschi'''  is  [[Wikipedia]]'s resident [[admin]] [[troll]], whose hobbies include trolling RFAs with swearing and being mean to the ''poor'' [[nerds]], too bad nobody gives a fuck. He also enjoys insulting [[vandal]]s (but who doesn't? after all [[ED:VIP]]). He just doesn't understand that as autistics, [[aspies]] have very delicate feelings and you can't say anything bad...sob. What an insensitive fuck!

Moreschi uses his admin powers like an [[Los Angeles|LAPD]] [[police]] officer, so basically "to protect and serve the [[Bureaucratic fuck|powerful]]. His greatest troll ever was baiting the much hated [[aspie]] [[Loser|admin-wannabe]] [[Wikipedia:User:Qst|Qst]] at his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Qst RFA]. Unable to take the vicious tongue-lashing, Qst foolishly vandalized without a [[proxy]], and got [[Ban|pwned]] several hours later. 

His arch-nemesis is the troll Molag Bal, who is obsessed with [[TOW]]. When Molag tried to get unbanned Moreschi told him "Go back to ED, Molag, we don't need you here." Well too bad we don't either.

{{Quote|I can't, off the top of my head, remember who it was that said if Molag Bal ever became an administrator they would engage in rough [[In the ass|anal]] [[sex]] with 12 truck drivers and a monkey...now, not saying I altogether agree with the expression, but the sentiment is spot-on.|Moreschi}}

By the way, Molag Bal already has a secret administrator account. Now in the Moreschi Versus [[SlimVirgin]] grudge match:
{{Quote|You, Sarah or Linda or whatever the hell your name is, can keep well out of this. Just because I fucked over your little backdoors clique in the full light of day does not give you the right to follow me around chucking dung from the sidelines.|Moreschi}}
This comment caused [[David Gerard]] to boot Moreschi from the Wikipedia Mailing List.
