{{quote|So far, I say I go as low as 14 because that's the legal limit in [[Canadia|Canada]]. Any less, I wouldn't feel comfortable pursuing it so I wouldn't really be able to find out if it was right for me. I do think I'd be fine with 8-13 though, honestly.|Tyciol|[http://www.annabelleigh.net/messages/386964.htm on where he draws the line].}}

{{quote|I'm very interested in the furry culture, I read a lot of the web comics and like the [[yiff|art]]. If I ever have a sizable amount of money maybe I'd try fursuiting, looks fun.|Tyciol|A furry is born.}}

{{quote|Is it relevant to mention how he was made the Wikipedia mascot over Wikipe-tan who was demoted to be a WikiProject mascot, yet she's much more popular?|Tyciol 06:42, 23 March 2009 (UTC)|Tyciol, upset that Wikipedia decided to not go with the [[loli]] mascot. Also he likes to go around ED loli images <s>and rate them a scale of 1-10</s>}}

==[[LiveJournal]]==
Drama found from the [[kick the freak]] LJ group in all cases.

===Moonlily===
[[Image:pedopost.gif|thumb|right|[[wtf]]???]]
:{{lj|moonlily78}} sez: "Its belittling, degrating, and mentally straining on the children."
:{{lj|tyciol}} responds: "I think you may mean emotionally straining. A crossword puzzle is mentally straining, and quite beneficial. As for emotional strain, a little bit is part of living life, long as it's not so extreme as to be scarring. It would be if the aforementioned negative qualities are true, so back them." [http://community.livejournal.com/kick_the_freak/11491.html?thread=70371#t70371]

In the world of [[pedophile|pedos]], certain truths cannot be taken for granted.  [[Some argue]] that kiddie porn isn't degrading.  That means as a member of the oppressive anti-cp majority, you need to back up your arguments to [[ohbutyouwillpet|babyrapers]].

===Dookiedragon===
[[Image:SliceTy.jpg|thumb|Dookie's fursona loves Ty.]]
:{{lj|dookiedragon}} sez: "Kiddie porn, as in the images with REAL people and children is FUCKED. Free or not, a child WAS harmed, maybe not by you, but still."<br />{{lj|tyciol}} responds: "In some cases they'd be harmed, in which case I'd hope I wouldn't be aroused by such images, but '''there's still nothing wrong with viewing them,''' though there is something wrong with paying for them, or not reporting them to the authorities. [...] Even so, to say that they'd always be being harmed isn't necessarily accurate, as that would mean any sex would be harmful. There would exist a minority that wouldn't harm the child. I didn't have any outside influence at all from adults and I did a lot of weird perverted shit when I was 3-4, much less 7-14, that I can remember." [http://community.livejournal.com/kick_the_freak/11491.html?thread=46051#t46051]

Presumably tyciol is a member of this [[childlove|minority]] that [[lies|wouldn't harm the child]].  After all, he doesn't ''pay'' for his kiddie pr0n!
:{{lj|tyciol}} sez: "The whole 'a child can't consent to putting their photos online' is under the same route as them not consenting to sex, which I also argue anyway. [...] No, just make it illegal to put it up without the child and their guardian's consent. Obviously it's quite moot, I fully agree that making child porn should be illegal as long as child sex is, so '''until that's resolved,''' there's no much point discussing it." [http://community.livejournal.com/kick_the_freak/11491.html?thread=60131#t60131]

Lulz ensue as {{lj|non con love}} says that being trolled is especially bad for a [http://community.livejournal.com/kick_the_freak/11491.html?thread=56291#t56291 past molestation victim] and {{lj|tyciol}} says that [http://community.livejournal.com/kick_the_freak/11491.html?thread=68067#t68067 he wants the same rights] as the police have to view kiddie pr0n, because it's just "harmless looking" and "helps [[Basement Cat|cat]]ch perpetrators."

===Gettin' Personal!===
[[Image:TYCIOLWRRRYYYYYYYYby rabidfreak.jpg|thumb|some fanart]]
{{lj|moonlily78}} and {{lj|chinesedentist}} then [http://community.livejournal.com/kick_the_freak/11491.html?thread=67811#t67811 escalate] to {{lj|tyciol}}'s omg [[personal journal]], and {{lj|tyciol}} brings it back into the community thread and points out that if he were to have a daughter, he "believe[s] the role of parent (and teacher) takes presidence over romantic relationships."

Nice.

===Other Stuff===
It should also be noted that along with kiddie p0rn {{lj|tyciol}} is also a big [[fanboi]] of [[incest]] and [[bestiality]]. What a winner.

[[Image:Tyciol%27s_cat.JPG|thumb|Tyciol finally [[a cat is fine too|gets lucky]].]]
Moar recent fail: in addition to his very promising career on [[TOW]] and [[LJ]], Tyciol is also failing it as a YouTuber. Unable to foster one creative thought of his own, Tyciol makes videos about his wanderings around his mom's front yard.  After the [[troll|proper responses]] were elicited, he [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|set all of his stimulating videos to private]]. He has since featured a favorite clip of his, for [[masturbation|fast access]].

<center><youtube>xU9W7Qo1T6M</youtube></center>
In a fit of boredom, Tyciol thought it would be great fun to call attention to himself. He started leaving comments on pages in an attempt to stir up some good old-fashioned pedo-[[drama]]. It worked, but much better than he thought. In retaliation, Tyciol and everyone he subscribes to were covered in a shitstorm of pedo-[[hate]]. [[Lulz]] ensued:
{{quote|DONT you freaking dare comment on my page!!....This is a massege to amsterdambound fckhdx100 and themeanstoanend...I HATE YOU ALL!!!|WTFpropductions|[[srs|serious fucking business]]}}

{{quote|Holy shit. Umm...k I'm tired of deleting stuff. Just a couple notes to clarify:
*distinguish readers between the letter Y and the letter V. The icon helps too though I guess he might mimic that later if he wants.
*Leave 777 alone, I don't use sock puppets. While I don't have any reason to think so, for all I know he's being honest about being 10, and I know you types tend to be against harassing the tweens right?|Tyciol|[[You fail it|failing it]]}}

===[[TOW]]===
[[Image:Pedo mourn 2.png|right|outline|80px]]
Tyciol finally got his ass [[B&]] from TOW [[last Thursday]] for ''"Pro-pedophile activism"'', with [[Postlethwaite]] swinging the [[banhammer]]. Needless to say, this caused the usual [[drama bomb]], as the Wikipedos ran about trying to deal with it, and poor Ryan caught the [[Lulz|fallout]] from it.
:"''If '''I''' think they're '''probably''' a pedophile, the '''likelihood''' is that they've made pro-pedophilia edits so I'll block them''" "''[[Nathanr|if any user who's brought to my attention I strongly '''suspect''' is a pedophile, they'll be blocked]]''" - [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=&showtopic=27033&view=findpost&p=201605 Ryan's reviews]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Tyciol Log], Foundation mailing list: [http://www.mail-archive.com/foundation-l@lists.wikimedia.org/msg08874.html individual messages], forum in [http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/foundation/184197 Gossamer] (4 pgs) or [http://old.nabble.com/Pedophilia-and-the-Non-discrimination-policy-td26556495.html Nabble] (5 pgs) formats

Tyciol also got his ass band on Wikimedia Commons despite pedos on Commons initially [[cum|coming]] to his rescue. His block on commons generated the usual sperging out by Aspie Wikipedos.

Then in August, Wikipedo's decided that they didn't want him on any project at all so they globally locked his account [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tyciol evoking a bawwwfest on his meta talk page].

===[[Encyc]]===
In ongoing fail, the latest news is that Tyciol was brutally [[banhammer]]ed Jan 14 2010 by <s>Encyc owner [[USI|Emperor]]</s> [http://encyc.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Cheka User:Chika] in a fit of righteous [[rage]].[http://encyc.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Tyciol] Expiry time of infinite (account creation disabled). This lead to Eme/Wikademia inquiring as to [[WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY]].  [http://encyc.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cheka&diff=19887&oldid=10548]

Also permanently banned from the [[forum]] (much alike [[WR]]) '''"permanently banned from this board" "A ban has been issued on your username" "please contact the Board Administrator for more information."'''
