In May of 2008 (see [[Last Thursday]]), [[British]] [[emo]]s got so butthurt with [[Daily Mail|a newspaper]] saying [[WHEN I WAS|My Chemical Romance]] was [[fact|shit]] that they actually managed to look outside of themselves for just long enough to form a lulzy protest march against the evil media headquarters.


'''No, seriously. Look, we're not making this shit up:'''

{{quote|I HATE MCR! They fucking seriously suck. I hope all their fans [[an hero]] at the protest. |[[Tom Serson]]}}

{{quote|So, their way of proving they're NOT a cult is to repeatedly chant insults at something that has a different opinion than them, under orders from one guy? 
  
Yeah, not at all like a cult.

|-Well spoken, JewTube TruthCat}}

==Origins==
[[Image:Hannah_emo_hanged_herself.jpg|thumb|Socially retarded and ugly as sin, [[Hannah Bond]] became [[an hero]] because of how shit MCR are.]]

The situation began [[At least 100 years ago]] when veteran [[old media]] [[trolls]] The [[Daily Mail]] published a series of articles entitled [http://anonym.to/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-566481/Why-child-safe-sinister-cult-emo.html The Sinister Cult of Emo]. This trolling dates back to 2006, when journalists decided to warn the paper's readership of [[lemonparty| middle-aged,]] [[white]], [[Nazi| right-wingers]] about the alarming possibility of their kids growing up to be [[faggots]], in articles such as [http://anonym.to/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-400953/EMO-cult-warning-parents.html this]. 

However, [[shit nobody cares about| no one gave a shit]] until 2008 when the ''Daily Mail'' blamed the [[suicide]] of a [[loli|13 year old girl]] named <s>James</s> [[Hannah Bond]] on her infatuation with [[My Chemical Romance]] in articles [http://anonym.to/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1018516/Girl-13-hangs-obsessed-Emo-suicide-cult-rock-band.html here], [http://anonym.to/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-564611/Girl-13-hangs-obsessed-Emo-suicide-cult-rock-band.html here], [http://anonym.to/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1019750/The-tragic-story-happy-popular-intelligent-13-year-old-committed-suicide-emo.html here], and [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-566481/Why-child-safe-sinister-cult-emo.html here]. It was at this point that [[butthurt]] Emokids decided to [[all_caps|UNLEASH THE FUCKING FURY]], and organized an [[IRL]] [[Habbo]] raid on the Daily Mail office. 

The march is taking place over a full day on Saturday, May 31st 2008, from 10am till 10pm (because [[fat]] [[emo]]s walk really slowly, presumably). No I'm not trolling, this shit is serious, look, there's a [http://www.whatthefrank.co.uk/details.html website about it] and everything.

On the 22nd May 2008, [[i|/i/nsurgents]] at [[Britchan|Ebaums]] were sitting around stroking their manly cock-hair and wondering what [[lulz]] can come from the [[emo]] protest, when it struck upon an idea: Simply prove the fears of all the middle aged right wing fucks correct by insinuating that yes, [[fact|Emo kids really are just a suicide cult]]; and that the protests will culminate in the mass suicide of all the [[attention whores|protesters]].

==Operation JewTube==

[[Image:OperationJewtube.jpg|thumb|<s>The OP</s> a repost]]

{{squote|
Of course, we all know the sauce of the recent influx of moral faggotry to Anonymous: JewTube. These kids saw the videos and thought they'd be part of the gang without understanding a fucking thing, and now we're bogged down with the fuckers. 

But... all this does is point out how powerful Jewtube is as a spamming medium. Jewtube is almost single-handedly responsible for completely subverting Chanology from being lots of fun; to bordering on bullshit moralfaggotry. 

Now... we can use Jewtube to completely subvert someone else's movement! Mainly; the My Chemical Romance fans marching against The Daily Mail. 

| The grammar at Britchan is truly inspirational}}

==How [[You]] Can Help==

===Step 1: JewTube===

[[Image:Moar_emo_butthurt.png|thumb|For pacifists, these guys sure are angry.]]
[[Image:Moar_emo_butthurt2.png|thumb|Moar.]]
[[Image:MCRTerrorists.jpg|thumb|Internet Terrorists hijacked protest!]]
[[Image:Omg_pure_winnnnn.png|thumb|"I stayed up for [[OVER 9000|over 36]] HOURS trying to think of ways to stop it in case it was real" And not for one minute did it occur to you that the idea of kids committing suicide at an anti-suicide rally was [[retarded|obviously satire]]?]]
[[Image:Bad_Anon.jpg|thumb| >HAY GUISE IMA FAGGOT]]
[[You|Any idiot]] can make a [[YouTube|JewTube]] video. If you're using [[Windows]], chances are your PC came with a free copy of [[Windows Movie Maker]]. 

Brace yourself, stick some [[shit|MCR]] music on a video, post a quick sideshow of emo photos, and publicize the march with utter sincerity. 

'''But.... point out that at the end of the march is going to be a mass-suicide.'''

===Step 3: Troll the shit out of these fail sites===

[[Image:Delicious_emo_jb 001.jpg|thumb|Ignore the user galleries and stay on target, Anonymous, STAY ON TARGET... goddamit... fap fap fap]]


Amazingly, the emos [http://anonym.to/http://www.buzznet.com/tags/mychemicalromance/forum/ have their own fail version of /i/], without the lulz, of course.

[[do it faggot|Needless to say]], they would appreciate your [[rape|contribution]], Anonymous.

[http://anonym.to/http://www2.kerrang.com/2008/05/mcr_fans_to_march_against_the.html Kerrang] and [http://anonym.to/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/emo-welcome-to-the-black-parade-832854.html The Independent] have articles mentioning the protest with comment sections.

Perhaps some mothers should get over there to voice their concern?

Perhaps some kids heard that everyone else is doing it, so maybe they'll bring the necessary equipment just in case?

WON'T SOMEBODY OTHER THAN PEDOBEAR PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN??? (No)
{{clear}}

===Step 4: Man the Harpoonz===

At 21:30, donning the usual IRL Raid gear, go and place boxes of cheap razor blades around the protest site. Boxes need to be clearly labeled something lulzy. 

PROTIP: When purchasing razors buy small amounts at multiple stores to avoid any potential legal lashback from epic win/fail should they actually should decide to become an heroes. Also, when handling them, latex gloves are your friend. Don't worry about the box, enough people have handled it to make lifting latent finger prints near impossible.

PROTIP: Buying small amounts at multiple stores mean that you're going to be captured on CCTV at multiple stores, it means you're going to be recognized in multiple stores, it means they're going to have multiple witnesses. Don't be a [[retard]] about it and collaborate.

*STEP 1: Meet other anon prior to IRL raid
*STEP 2: Have each anon buy [[at least 100|small amounts]] of razor blades, only enough not to arouse suspicion
*STEP 3: Dump them all into a box labeled FREE RAZOR BLADES
*STEP 4: [[????]]
*STEP 5: [[PROFIT]]

'''NEW Dropsite:''' "The protest has changed location and will now be held by Marble Arch. There is a concrete area there, where we will go. Marble Arch is in Oxford Street, London and is right next to Hyde Park."

===Step 6: PROFIT!!! Butthurt emos are lolcows of epic levels===

The [[Lollercaust]] reaction has been incredibly fucking quick, and incredibly fucking lulzy.

Unfortunatly it isn't a joke and even if it was meant as a joke we have to take it seriously because it's peoples lives we're talking about here, plus it's bullshit if people are trying to say 'oh their not a deathcult' then going and killing themselves.

They were misinformed, believing bad journalism from the Daily Mail, and have decided to infiltrate MCR's fans protest against the daily mail. These guys are hypocrites. Hannah Bond's depression leading to her suicide was all written on her journals in Bebo, which her parents removed. She had a history of being bullied at school which ultimately led her to snap and end her own life. This group needs to focus on real issues. They're becoming as much of a cult as the group they're going after.|holy shit, this guy is [[batshit insane|ON TO US]]!!!}}

==Aftermath==
[[Image:MCRmy Fail.jpg]]
<br>Look out Daily Mail! The [[Fag|"MCRmy"]] is coming to get you!
minor warning solution in generally a bat ...most effective if u throw razors in the opposite direction.
[[Image:Lolffail.jpg|Lolffail.jpg]]
<br>What absolute fail!  25 people consisting of children and parents.  MCR must be soooo proud!

[[Image:Aftermath1.JPG|Image:Aftermath1.JPG]]
<br>Even more fail. Barely broke [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|over 9,000]].

==Recap==
Theres two things that could have happened here.

1. [[Truth|Emos are too busy bawwwing to organize properly]].

2. Since [[Anonymous]] put up a [[over 9000|shit load]] of the fake videos and trolled the living shit out of the emo's websites, that there was mass confusion and the emos just went [[an hero]] else where.

Some real challenging and informative reporting, as we gave come to expect from The Guardian.
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/audio/2008/jun/01/fitzsimmons.mcr?gusrc=rss&feed=media link Lulzy interviews of MCR lolis]

==Fair & Balanced Protest Footage==
Anonymous had some fun [[raep|enturbulating]] a bunch of [[13 year old boys|pubeless morons]] at the protest and caught it all on camera. In between the [[homosexuality|hugging]] and the [[mantrain|conga lines]], a [[man the harpoons|whale]] has a shitfit, and a girl sets a newspaper on fire. All fine examples on [[cancer killing /b/|"win"]] and how Anonymous Deliverers.
