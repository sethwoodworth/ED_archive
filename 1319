'''Candyjunkie''', whose real name was '''Abraham Biggs''', (moar liek Jewbraham Niggs, [[amirite]]?) was a [[Gay|young]] black person living in [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. He thus presents an odd example of a [[suicide]]. It is, among niggers, extremely rare as they typically die in [[gang]] fights and [[KFC]] robberies (or both at once, for several gangs often attempt to steal [[chicken]] from said restaurant at the same time) before being able to kill themselves. Abraham, however, is what is known as an Oreo (white on the inside) or '''''HALFRICAN AMERICAN''''', and as such, did what many whites do: he took large amounts of anti-depressants, chugged NyQuil and [[Attention Whore|cried on internet forums]]. Eventually, young Abraham's genes betrayed him, and he chose to follow in the footsteps of Sean "Puffy" Combs [[Ripper|by copying a white man who had played the same tune before him]].

As Abraham had attempted to OD before, he foresaw little difficulty, but things got too real, too fast. Perhaps the funniest part of Abraham's suicide was that even though he had been dead for several hours, the [[cops]] still pulled their <strike>guns</strike> [[cocks|<b>TASERS</b>]] on him, which proves that even in a post-[[Obama]] America, you still [[Serious Business|'''CAN'T BE TOO FUCKING CAREFUL.''']]

==The Timeline==
Obviously [[butthurt]] over [[life]], Candyjunkie proceeds to post a goodbye thread on a [[bodybuilding]] forum to inform the people of his commitment to becoming [[an hero]].

* Nov 19, 2008 5:32-5:51 AM: User izaktj reports CandyJunkie is trying to [[masturbate|sleep]]. Miscers plays around with the thought of calling the cops, but ultimately shrug off the issue and thread. CandyJunkie's webcam continues to roll as he lays [[dead|motionless]] during the 6 hours the thread is ignored. 

* Nov 19, 2008 12:04 PM: User baby_matty bumps thread, stating that CandyJunkie is "still laying there." Posters begin to suspect that CandyJunkie is no longer breathing because of the lack of movement on his webcam, pertaining to the [[Goatse|expanding]] of the ribcage during respiration.

* Nov 19, 2008 1:03 PM: After alerting forum [[moderator]]s, user AlexNipples receives controversial response from moderator "Roxie" regarding taking action to [[ignore|save]] CandyJunkie. 

[[Image:Doitcandy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[DO IT FAGGOT]]]]

* Nov 19, 2008 1:05 PM: User IVEverLow posts thread linking to CandyJunkie's phone number. A few minutes later, a user calls, is forwarded to voicemail and leaves infamous message [[DO IT FAGGOT|"Do it faggot."]] This user is now confirmed to be a [[retard]]. Posters begin to [[LOL|talk]] about CandyJunkie's [[lazy|lack of movement]] as a sign of death or drug induced coma. 

* Nov 19, 2008 1:53 PM: User Bulker reports CandyJunkie's personal information, including name and number. Suggests that they call cops. Posters discuss the legitimacy of the broadcast, considering the possibility that the video is a still image or on a loop, like in that crappy [[Keanu Reeves]] movie, ''[[Drug#Amphetamines|Speed]]''. 

* Nov 19, 2008 2:09 PM: Users take action. Bulker sends failed email to Miami police department, posts the Miami Police department contact information and urges other posters to contact. 

* Nov 19, 2008 2:32 PM: [[Spam|Bulker calls Miami Police department three times]] with success, but fails to convey the urgency in his message. 

* Nov 19, 2008 2:41 PM: User mophatthedamaja confirms CandyJunkie's suicide note is indeed [[copypasta]], while Normg002 posts link to CandyJunkie's MySpace page. 

* Nov 19, 2008 2:55 PM: User jjlee138 announces successful communication with police; reports they are en route to CandyJunkie's [[prison|location]].

* Nov 19, 2008 3:30 PM: Live on webcam, Broward County police break down CandyJunkie's door, throw a board at Abraham's butt, and shine a laser on his leg. A cop [[steals|covers]] the webcam. The broadcast ends.

==The Note==
[[Image:Candyjunkie 2008-11-22 daily news.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[X? In My Y?|It's more likely than you think]]]]
This note has been [[Confirmed For Brawl|confirmed]] to be [[copypasta]]. 
<br>
<br>
'''[[Shit Nobody Cares About|To Whom It May Concern,'''
<br>
<br>
I am going to leave this for whoever stumbles across my bookmarks later on.
I hate myself and I hate living. I think that if someone who knows me
reads this they will know who I am. So I will leave this unsigned. I am
an a@#hole. I have let everyone down and I feel as though I will never
change or never improve. I am in love with a girl and I know that I am
not good enough for her. I have come
to believe that my life has all been meaningless. I keep trying and I
keep failing. I have thought about and attempted suicide many times in
the past. I used to think of my failure as some mystical way of telling
me that I was really meant for something meaningful. The only thing I
dread, besides the pain, is the way my family will suffer. I do not want
my mother or father to think that it was anything they did that lead me
to kill myself. I never really had any plans of leaving a note. I
thought that I would not be able to describe why I want to do this and I
am right. There is no way to tell you or anyone else why I dread every
new day. My father had such high expectations for me and tried to give
me every opportunity to improve upon myself. I let him down. I think
that I am a major disappointment to him. I have a job but I?m always broke
and I am in college but barely, I show up to class but that?s about it.
I want my life to end. I am tired of f@#$ing up everything. I
am tired of people always telling me that they do not like me. I am
tired of trying to be decent. I hope that someone finds this post and I
hope that my parents know that I f@#$ed up not them. It is my fault I
screwed up my own life.
The hate that rages within me, rages not for those I love so dearly or
those who have crossed my path.
This hate rages full force towards me and only me.
I have long forgiven those who've hurt me, but I have not and cannot
come to terms to forgive myself for the things I have done to myself, and
the things I've done to hurt those in my life.
You have all touched my life in one way or another,
especially those whom I call family.
I cannot tell you how sorry I am for ending my life the way I did. I
hope that you can all find it in your heart to see it as way for me not
suffering anymore and that I am finally at rest with myself, for being at
rest with the guilt that constantly ate at me for so long.
Please forgive me all for taking my own life so early. I tried so hard
to fight against this strong battle. I have reached out for help so many
times, and yet I believe, I was turned away because of the things I did,
that it is a punishment I am willing to take, for I know that being who I am
has only brought myself and others pain.
I love you all and will forever live within the memories we created.
Forgive me.
<br>
<br>
Love always and forever,
<br>
<br>
as for my signature I will leave you with a quote so that if anyone
reads this they will know it's me, "Can't feel pain if your dead? Just Saying"
<br>

Users on justin.tv claim to have seen him ingest pills and alcohol, after which he lies down and stops breathing for ten hours. At approximately 3:30PM, his door is broken down by a [[Racist|police officer]] who points his <strike>gun's</strike> taser's laser pointer at the passed out nigra's ass, [[for the lulz|just in case]]. After giving the okay, an EMT makes his way towards the body and (presumably) [[necrophilia|checks if CandyJunkie is alive]]. The police officer covers the webcam.
