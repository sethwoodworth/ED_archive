'''Peanut Butter Jelly Time''' was a fad on [[the internets]] that wasn't funny the first time you saw it, and, after that, only became more and more [[gay]]. Your first clue should be that it was later featured on TV's unfunny incarnate, ''[[Family Guy]]''. It features a [[Dildo|banana]] dancing to an [[Tay Zonday|unusual song]] about... well, peanut-butter and jelly.  But [[you]] probably already knew that, didn't you?

==The Info==
Ever since the original "Peanut Butter Jelly Time" was made, several [[ppl]] have made new videos and sadly even remixed the song. Obviously, every last one of them [[suck]]ed the mighty [[meat]] missile even more so than the original. Managing to [[blow]] that much obviously deserves some credit.

But, unfortunately, some still find it interesting to watch the icon dance for more than a few minutes... even after it lost all its appeal. Worse, some people like to collect "Peanut Butter Jelly Time" pictures.
