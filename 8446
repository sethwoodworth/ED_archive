Like any factory, defects slip through. Unfortunately, you don't get a receipt in this case. 

[[Inflation art]]ists... Where do we start? Artists from this particular slum of the [[Internets]] are always a dime a dozen, though the inherent amount of fail of some stands out much more than the contributions of others. (see: [[Auchimura]]) While this particular star of the article may have more talent than the given example, though that's definitely not saying much, he surely offers a nigh-endless amount of extreme, horrible, mother-fucking, cock-sucking, cum-guzzling [[FAIL]] instead.

This... is Tofer ([[Powerword]]: Christofer Bray), the [[lie|Legend]] Inflator... at his flattering finest.

== Origins of the Legend Inflator ==

[[Last Thursday|Fourscore and seven years ago]] ([[Sauce]] plz... date may be wrong), the sexual activities between a male akita and a female crow, blessed by the malevolent powers of [[Satan]] himself (moar [[sauce]] needed), put forth upon this universe an abomination... An abomination so cruel, so vile, one cannot fathom the horrors that rush down one's spine when they find this [[furry|beast]] looking at you. Imagine, if you will, a [[retarded|one-winged, humanoid Akita]] with brown fur and black head-hair, clad in only silver tights and boots, who always has some expression between taking a shit and psychosis under his [[stupid|moustache]], staring at you with his [[gay|neon-pink]] eyes.

...What? Did I fucking stutter?

'''I'm not making this shit up, people!''' 

As one can see, this specimen is so unique, he gave himself a "black anger wing". Let's repeat that again, shall we? [[special|Black... Anger... Wing...]] Due to this, Tofer, as a character, is completely original and awesome in design... design that can only be taught at a prestigious art college, which is something that shall be inspected later. 

What exactly does the title "Legend Inflator" mean? Does it mean that he inflates great, wonderous, legendary [[furfags]] like [[Virus-20]]? Does it mean that he's simply an inflator that proclaims himself to be [[legend|legendary]]? Perhaps he's just completely retarded... I think everyone knows the right answer to this question of the ages.

So how did he earn the title of "The Legend Inflator"? [[ego|Self-proclamation. How else?]] This lolcow would make any inflation fan proud with the size of his inflated self-worth. One may say he's overcompensating for something, but it sure isn't his ego. Some scientists collaborated that, on December 21, 2012, Tofer's ego shall reach critical mass and detonate, in an event not unlike the Big Bang, wiping out all life in the Universe as we know it. There shall be no escape... no refuge. It is a fate that all have to accept. Either that, or become a victim of his acts, which are much akin to those of a serial killer.

And now, for you viewing pleasure, a gallery of him and his ancestors, doing what he does best...

There you have it... It is pure, unadulterated fact. In 3000 BC, the prehistoric ancestor of Tofer, a smart Cavefur by the name of Tofur (Not Tofer, That's in the modern days...), decided to be inventive and create the very first inflation weapon... ([http://www.furaffinity.net/view/3946366/ Sauce found here]) A footpump and hose... in 3000 BC, and if the future is any indication, he'll have the technology to inflate victims in outer space without the joys of explosive decompression! Are we losing brain cells yet? Perhaps Tofer should just do this to save us from any more hellspawn...

Then again, how would we get continued lulz from such an asshat?

== From Humble Beginnings to [[fail|Greatness]] ==

With every artist comes the quest for improvement. Tofer is an exception to the rule. He needs no improvement, because he is a legend. Also, his peers know [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2864432/ talent] when they see it.

{{quote|"Oh wow, Vector is bloated up from the pop cans. By way, that was awesome art pic."|none other than everyone's favorite [[Auchimura|Kex Andy]], one of the Legend Inflator's numerous peers}}

Tofer truly is a motivated [[furry]]. So motivated, that for being at the bottom of the cesspool already, he's sure trying to see if he can dig the hole to a brand new low. Let's take a look at the evolution of his talent over the course of a year, shall we? Keep in mind that he goes to a prestigious art college. That could only help, right?

But wait! I hear you asking: "What is this presigious art college that keeps getting mentioned?"

Glad you asked!

[[File:inflatedmonalisa.jpg|thumb|You can aspire to create a masterpiece like this by going to a prestigious art college!]]
[[File:inflatedsistinechapel.jpg|thumb|This too!]]
===Higher Learning===

Every artist starts sometime. Some start at a ripe, early age. Some simply start too late. Tofer, easily put, was the latter. To rectify this though, the Legend Inflator made a pact with [[Cthulhu]] (or, was [[Auchimura|Kex Andy]]?), and thus, Tofer was given a full scholarship to a prestigious art college... An art college so ashamed, that it shall never be named. Don't believe this? See for yourself!

{{quote|...I even got a scholarship to even go the Art Institute College to further improve my inflation artwork!|Tofer, totally proclaiming something that is [[lie|100% truth]]}}  

What's this? A school that allows one to learn the skills of Leonardo Di Vinci and how he painted the inflated Mona Lisa, or even Michelangelo and his painting of the inflated Sistine Chapel? How intriguing! Needless to say, many lulz were had at the claim. One even stated this about it...

{{quote|This is comedy gold!|Someone who had epic lulz at Tofer's claim}}  

There also was some surprised chap was rather surprised at the completely non-ludicrous claims of the Legend Inflator, completely baffled at the thought of a college that existed for drawing inflation.

{{quote|There's a college for drawing inflation? O_o;;;;|Surprised chap who was rather shocked at the completely non-ludicrous claims of the Legend Inflator}}

The precocious Tofer was more than happy to answer our surprised chap.

{{quote|Well, not only inflation, there's others too, like Web Design, Video Game Design(Meaning u can actually make ur own video game, which is AWESOME!), and there a lot of arts there too, and I've seen that some of the artworks In AI contains inflation!|a precocious Tofer, answering a surprised chap's question}}

How kind of Tofer to point out that video game design means you make your own video game. So awesome. I'm sure no one knew what that meant. Thanks to a candid cameraman whose name shall not be disclosed, we spotted Tofer when he discovered this:

[[File:Omgwebsite.jpg|center|InFLashiun!! Art Institute College haz it!!]]

There's proof in the pudding thanks to the photograph taken... Inflation art studies... The Art Institute College haz it. Though, it is evident by the evolution of his artwork seen previously, he surely didn't gain any sort of improvements in talent by going to his esteemed alma mater. Perhaps, though, he did get one thing from his quest for higher learning... and that would be...

== Originality! ==

{{cg|Originality at Its Finest!|furry1gallery|center|<gallery>
Image:Suckolux1.jpg|Oh look, a suck-o-lux vacuum! Such an original gag!
Image:Suckolux2.jpg|Tofer portrays the original star victim of the suck-o-lux, Roger Rabbit, along with some [[Oz Kangaroo|other unfortunate half-wit]], who happens to be his favorite [[faggot|artist]].
Image:Suckolux3.jpg|Suck-o... I think that term says it all...
Image:Suckolux4.jpg|[[Original Content|Isn't this completely different than the other three?]]!
</gallery>}}

Let's give you a multiple choice question... What do all four of these pics have in common? 
<br>A) All of these pics suck.
<br>B) All of these pics blow.
<br>C) ...? (These pics have made your remaining brain cells dissolve. Our condolences...)
<br>D) Hey, wait! You're being sarcastic. That's not originality at all!
<br>E) All of the above
<br>
<br>If you selected anything else but E, the utter stupidity of the subject at hand has been lowering your [[intelligence]] score much too low. On the other hand, if you have continued to succeed rolling your Willpower saving throws and picked E, congratulations! This is the true belly of the beast: his [[Originality]]... 

Perhaps it was said too soon... It was a silly statement to say one could learn originality. If anything, all sarcasm aside from the opening gallery of this segment, Tofer has originality in droves... droves of epic proportions. One could say that the amount of his originality only pales in comparison to his ego. Unfortunately, originality =/= good. In this case, originality = extreme mindfuck. Here's a montage of Tofer's originality at its greatest, mindfucking levels.

{{cg|More Originality|furry1gallery|center|<gallery>

Image:trashinflation.jpg| What is this trash? Oh yeah... it's inflation via trash. 100% Original!
</gallery>}}

But wait, there's more! He's not just original with his own ideas. Tofer also gives his original takes on some legendary franchises! I mean, it would take a Legend Inflator to make a tribute to a [[Final Fantasy|Legend Franchise]], right? ...Right?

</gallery>}}


Better yet, run for the fucking hills... especially if you did something to cross him, or give him his own medicine. If you were one of these confused souls, may God have mercy on your soul. The Legend Inflator sure won't. That is certain, as he will open up a horrifying can of...

== Revenge, with Your Name On It ==

[[File:Killertoilet.jpg|thumb|Quite an artistic work here... See, Tofer's even kind and helpful enough to unclog your toilet, by having someone shove their face into it and sucking all the shit and piss out! Thank you so much, Tofer! Now how much is the plumbing bill?]]

{{quote|[[Truth|Evil... Cunning... Maniacal...]] [[Lie|Artistic... Kind... Helpful...]] These are all traits of Tofer... Legend Inflator...|Tofer, on his most shining traits.}}  

Evil, cunning, and maniacal? Yes. Artistic, kind, and helpful? Sorry, but I think Kevin Spacey has something to say about that.

== The Legend and Drama ==
(This is from a concerned fur who sucks at scripting, It doesn't matter if you remove it. I am not part of the actual ED staff.)
The "Legend" isn't exactly as nice as you would think. And I meant towards others not artwise. He has been known to get into Drama a lot. For example, he yelled out at someone and got involved in their own problems. Deviantart user Lucario375 got this shout one day http://comments.deviantart.com/4/10238868/1840816369 . (From the people involved) We learned that it was a dumb fight in one of those chatrooms which involved Lucario375 and another furry. Then Lucario375 made this journal, http://lucario375.deviantart.com/journal/37940050/#comments and of course, The "Legend" got involved. Now, from what I've heard, The "Legend" and Lucario375 are ok now and aren't fighting. But this just shows how great Tofer takes others problems into his own hands.
