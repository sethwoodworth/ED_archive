The Video Professor 16
{{elaw}}
'''The Video Professor 16''' were [[anonymous|16 people]] who posted their truths about the [http://www.videoprofessor.com Video Professor business] on [[TOW|ToW]]. In the same time frame, they and other people posted hundreds of plausibly reasonable critical comments [http://www.infomercialscams.com/scams/video_professor here] (deleted) and [http://www.ripoffreport.com/searchresults.asp?q1=ALL&q4=&q6=&q3=&q2=&q7=&searchtype=0&submit2=Search%21&q5=Video+Professor&Search=Search here.](baleeted) Still, you've got to wonder what these people expected from a company that makes its [[money]] by filling late-night [[television]] with lurid and [[stupid]] [[advertising]].

==Whining consumers trolled==
[[Image:Video Professor bitches dont.jpg|thumb|left|Now you know.]]
The Video Professor organization [[Legal action|sent out their lawyers]] to [[troll]] the people who complained (not giving a shit about the compaints being valid) on all three sites. Scherer, the "Video Professor", claimed that they only wanted the names because he thought Justin Leonard (owner of infomercialscams.com) must be [[insane|inventing the complaints]]; if not, [[Giant enemy crab|the Video Professor's competitors]] must be [[post]]ing them, because he sure as hell never did nothin' wrong. He also said "We have never sued a customer and we never will sue a customer", claiming he just wanted to contact the whiners to return their money, give them each a big hug, generally kiss and make up, and maybe have some [[secks]].

Scherer might have been confused or had a change of heart because they [http://www.citizen.org/documents/videoprof20071218.pdf forced at least one guy who complained to the Denver Post to sign a promise "never to say anything about Video Professor in the future."]

===Wikipedia Makes Its Users BEND OVER AND TAKE IT===
[[Image:All ur video professor.png|right]]
To prove a point about their legal separation (in theory) from the [[fucktard|rubes]] who do their [[Slavery|volunteer labor]], the Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29/Archive_25#Releasing_IP_addresses_of_registered_users:_the_Video_Professor_incident gave all requested IP addresses to the Video Professor's troll lawyers] without even a token fight. "Wikipedia" here would logically mean the [[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation (WMF)]] but Jimbo and company don't say '''"the Wikimedia Foundation"''' until late in the discussion; can't let the [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sucker "editors"] know too much. If you read the [[tl;dr]] thread, the WMF's [[Fursuit|pet]] lawyer, [[Mike Godwin]], takes credit for some kind of action. He then claims it is too [[Secret|'''sekrit''']] to talk about, so you'd have to be some kind of [[fucktard|fucking idiot]] to believe they really did anything.

===Smaller Sites Say NO!===
The two smaller sites, despite having fewer resources and much lower page rankings, refused to rat out their contributors (although only [http://www.ripoffreports.com this one] was unequivocal about it from the start).

===Wanted [[Dead or Alive: Extreme Beach Volleyball|Dead or Alive]]: Flagrantly Defamatory Anonymous===
[[Image:Shit jokes r us.png|left]]
The [[troll|lawyers]] decided to concentrate on a single whiner. On behalf of Scherer, they gave this one high praise as '''"the most flagrantly defamatory anonymous poster on Wikipedia"''' and demanded that Comcast hand over related "identifying information" (this also proves that the WMF's claimed '''sekrit cloak-and-dagger''' "action" meant nothing). Comcast refused, even though the lawyers "left two telephone messages with Comcast to determine whether the subpoenaed information will be produced timely." With syntax like that, maybe Comcast just never managed to unscramble their sentences.
