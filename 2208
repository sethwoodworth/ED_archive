'''Des Gregor''', an old fat [[internets]] lurker, is the saddest most gullible loser on this planet. During one lonely night behind his [[Macintosh]] 5260, the freak came across a tempting offer regarding a mail-order bride in [[Africa]], along with 100,000 dollars in Jew gold. Because the stupid fuck has never felt the touch of a woman in his 56 years of living, the loner went along with it, because there was absolutely [[bullshit|no way]] this could be a scam. According to Des, those only happen in the ''[[movies]]''. What a dumb fat fuck!

Of course, as soon as Des got to Africa, he was kidnapped by a bunch of [[nigras]], and used as the test subject of their many [[bondage]]-related sexcapades. This included stripping him naked and firstly sucking him off and then making him give them head and swallow their cum (which he loved very much, he just kept begging and begging for more) and lastly binding him by the arms and legs, and [[retard|'beating' him with a machette]] (he has the scars to prove it!). After the darkies had their way with Des, they put out a 100,000 dollar ransom (irony!). Unfortunately, the [[cops]] tricked the nigra gang into coming out of their hide out and properly fucked the niggs up, after which the sucker was released.

After returning home, Des warned people of the dangers of the internet, and to 'make sure you check everything out 100 per cent'. The fat fuck learned his lesson the hard way. Though we all know it's just a matter of time before he falls for another hoax. After all he's a dumb stupid moron who is guaranteed to die alone [[dying alone|die alone]]! Hahahahaha!!!! Sucked in faggot!  Serves the fucker right!!!
