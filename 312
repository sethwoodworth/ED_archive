[[Aspergers|Child prodigy]] '''Akiane Kramarik''' was sent to earth by our lord [[goatse|Jesus Christ]] to spread a message of goodness and to end the world's suffering with divinely inspired [[art]]. Her poetry, drawings, and paintings, done in a style she has dubbed "imaginatism", are a [[lie|shining light]] upon the world.

[[attention whore|Featured]] on [[old media|national television]] Akiane can be seen calling attention to <strike>the evils of the world</strike> how great she is, and will work [[God]] into everything she says. This is interesting considering that her parents are [[atheists]], and she had no exposure to religion throughout her life, of 13 years. Her parents however have recently converted to [[Jews|Judaism]] in light of just how much people are willing to buy a horribly disproportionate (though cleverly shaded) story-book illustration of [[shit nobody cares about|Jesus or unicorns]].

Akiane lives in Post Falls Idaho and is a trademark of Akiane LLC (not kidding, look it up)

Akiane is an inspiration to [[deviantart|tartlets]] everywhere, and hopes to one day grow up to fully realize her [[furry]] nature.

Love<br><br>
Love is never alone<br>
Love is always crowded<br>
Love is the shared self<br><br>
We cannot own our love<br>
And we cannot teach our love<br><br>
The longest breath of love<br>
is the shortest distance to heaven<br><br>
The deepest life is love<br>
The deepest love is an embrace<br><br>
Love is not rest<br>
Love is peace<br>
Love is the purpose

== [[Controversy]] ==
{{quote|[[Some argue|Some art experts]] do not believe Kramarik is the sole creator of the artwork published under her name, though they believe she may be completing the artwork to some degree. When reporters asked the family if they could record a video of her painting a small image from start to finish, they declined saying that it wouldn't be a fair representation of her work.|[[TOW]]}}
