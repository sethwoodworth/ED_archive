'''Bump''' (or "bermp" in [[France|French]]) is a redundant term used on [[chan]]s to keep a [[thread]] [[GET|get]]ting. It is replying to a thread without [[Sage|saging]] it.

'''Bumping''' is a favorite device of [[attention whores]] particularly used when their post has failed to get the [[lulz]] they think they deserve, or, for once in their pathetic [[newfag]] lives, managed to get some [[lulz]] but no one noticed. Prepare for a series of [[sock puppet|sock puppets]] to continue bump the thread until they have received the affirmation they are seeking or [[become an hero]].   

Anyone who has ever '''bumped''' a thread is [[cancer]], and should [[lurk moar]]. The only exception is when you '''bump''' a thread that is '''at least 15 years old''', on a relevant topic, originally posted by yourself, [[for great justice]].

Unfortunately in its [[old meme|old]] age, "Bump" has been [[fag|fagatized]] by those <s>fucking fuckers</s> [[drama llama|drama llamas]] at [[Gaia]] who wish to procure more [[jewgolds]] to dress their nonexistent [[anime]] selves with worthless [[crap]]. Someone's gotsta gets da jewgolds. [[Pylons|Which is always insufficient.]]

==The Delicate Procedure of A Bumpage==

The creator of a thread goes underwater and gently bumps a meme with his <s>[[No girls on the internet|or her]]</s> [[cock|nose]].
The post comes up.
