'''Ramen''' (or '''Noodles''' if you're not a weeaboo faggot) is a cheap salty noodle soup that is sold everywhere. It is known as the official [[food]] of the starving artist, starving college student (or hell, ''any''one who's starving) and a staple of the [[weeaboo]]'s diet. These three [[retards|groups']] support earns Ramen Noodles the nickname of "Purina Student Chow". College students love it because one can buy [[at least 100|at least a hundred]] packages of Ramen noodles for about 5 US dollars. Basement dwellers love it because they're too weak to drag their fat saggy asses away from ''[[World of Warcraft|World of Warcrap]]'' for more than five minutes. Military experts theorize that by cutting off Ramen shipments they could easily cause every nerd in existence to die of starvation.

The only two good things about ramen are that (1) it costs like 12 cents a bag, making it a good source of sustenance if you're low on funds and/or too lazy to make a fucking box of Kraft macaroni, and (2) it doesn't taste like boiled ass (unless you're poor enough to have to live off of it, in which case the taste will eventually make you want to cauterize your taste buds).

[[Weeaboos]] love Ramen.  Ramen and [[Pocky]] are the <i>only</i> things they eat.  Seriously, poke a weeaboo right now.  It bleeds salty chicken water, doesn't it?  The only evidence we have so far as to <i>why</i> weeaboos are addicted to such an unholy substance is a bit of a mystery, but it is assumed that since they consider it to be <b>liek OMG SOOOOOOOOOOO KAWAII!!^__^!!! from NIPPON!!!</b>, they think it's from [[Japan]].  In reality, all Ramen is made in the USA because [[noone]] wants to waste time and money getting weeaboo food across the Pacific, and because no self respecting [[AZN|Jap]] would eat the stuff.  Real Japanese people live on the souls of dead babies and [[hentai|semen]].

[[Shit nobody cares about|The funny thing is, ramen isn't even Japanese. It's Chinese. Ramen means "Chinese noodles". They even write it in katakana, which is used for foreign words. Same goes for Japanese curry. So if you want to troll a weeaboo, tell them this fact and watch their head explode.]]

==Notice on the Ramen in a Cup==
[[Image:Oprah.jpg|thumb]]
Despite the instructions, you '''may''' cook it in the microwave. Just put some paper towels under it for when it inevitably boils over. Only problem is the Styrofoam releases hazardous chemicals, like benzene, titanium, and arsenic when microwaved, and you might end up dying, or growing [[boobs|man-boobies]] or tentacles after eating this stuff for a while. It doesn't affect the flavor though. You should only care if you're a [[hippie]]. 

Some scientists have argued that the chemicals released from the Styrofoam container may lead to [[anti-lulz]] if inhaled for extended periods of time. Notable figures who have become infected by extreme anti-lulz syndrome include Oprah the talk show Niggrah. 

Notice the extra, abnormal toe that we all know should not be there...ever. <S>Because of this perversion of nature, Oprah was forced to quit her talk show and become an employee at the Ramen factory where she must do the work dealing with electro-ejaculating the corpses of Ethiopian refugees which is the primary ingredient in beef flavored Ramen.</s>  wat
