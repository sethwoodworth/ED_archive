Urban75

'''[http://www.urban75.com Urban75.com]''' is a website run by an [[anarchist]] who eats babies in Brixton, [[England]]. There is a static site containing super-duper info on [[drugs]], protests, [[music]], politics, photography, and other [[shit nobody cares about]], and a discussion board where people talk about drugs, protests, music, politics, photography and other [[shit nobody cares about]]. If you want to know what's on it, just go there.

== Famous [[troll]]s ==
*'''ernestolynch''' used to troll the boards pretty effectively, but after a permanent [[ban]] has been reduced to rampant paranoia about being impersonated, conducting edit wars on [[Wikipedia]], and starting easily-identifiable troll accounts on the board, parodying [[black people]] and [[liberals]], though not very convincingly despite his assumed exposure to both as a teacher. It's a shame really.

*'''[[User:Fridgemagnet|Fridgemagnet]]''' is technically a moderator but also maintains several hundred secret trolling accounts (mostly used to post shitty viral links) as well as selling off email addresses to spammers, reading people's PMs, shopping anyone mentioning drugs to the rozzers, and generally being a [[cunt]].

*'''swarthy thug''' spent his time on the board making facile comments about leftie politics, slagging off [[Muslim]]s, insulting anyone who disagreed with him for pages and pages, and posting pictures of bagels, which apparently makes you the Second Fucking Coming of Internet Jesus to some. Banned. Comes back occasionally, gets banned again within five minutes because his supporters can't keep a straight face whenever he posts.

*'''tom k&e''' who spent a year trying to stir up infighting amongst people who were already infighting (now mostly found banning each other on [http://www.thetollinggang.org/forums/ the tolling gang forums]), before [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Urban75&diff=43569388&oldid=43330397 flouncing], resulting in nobody really giving much of a shit.

The quality of trolling on Urban75 is generally quite low, but it doesn't need to be terribly high because with a community that size you are always bound to offend ''someone''.
