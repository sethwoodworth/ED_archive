Braid
'''Braid''' is a popular puzzle game for PC and Xbox 360. It features one of the most [[retarded|high-brow]] stories in a vidya game to date, because the story isn't actually the story, and the actual story isn't even in the game. Yeah, its one of ''those''. You wanted a story? Well [[BAWWWWWW|too fucking bad]], because you're going to try to read about it on forums or some shit.

==Plot==
This is basically the story of the man that became the bedroom intruder then stole a tardis.
