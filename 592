'''Archive.org''', is a [[site]] that routinely crawls the [[Internets]] to make up a massive archive of old versions of webpages. This includes sites that have been pulled and [[CP|illegal images]]. It allows people to look at saved versions of websites from years ago and comes greatly in handy when writing [[ED]] articles about sites that no longer exist, or digging up past lulz that has otherwise being removed from the Internets. 

==The Wayback Machine==
When a [[re-re]] decides to delete their [[LiveJournal]] after the [[troll]]s descend and they just can't take it any more, the Wayback Machine allows us to laugh at their stupidity for all eternity. Unfortunately it is possible for websites to request exclusion from the archives by putting the file robots.txt in your home directory. This prevents websites from getting robo-stalked as in the case of [[MySpace]] which tampers with the [[ED]] writers' trolling arsenal.

Apparently the name of the site is a reference to an episode of ''The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show ''. While this reference to a shitty TV show that died before anyone can remember makes the website look like garbage don't be fooled, it is in fact quite useful. Unless you're looking up a [[MySpace]].

Pages pulled up by archive.org can be used as blackmail, as demonstrated by professional webcomics [[troll]] Scott Kurtz when he bitched about another web cartoonist re-publishing a [[blog]] post he wrote. Ironically, he has now apparently deleted that post, thus making the circle of [[lulz]] complete.

==Other services==
Archive.org also has an xbox hueg archive of 1900-1989 [[snuff|B movies]]. When you see them, you'll [[shit bricks]].
Hundreds of [[Mujahideen Video]]s are also submitted every day to the archive, only a handful being deleted. 
Another reason to go to archive.org is the massive population of [[shit|experimental musicians]].
Deleted [[CP]] sites are also archived.
