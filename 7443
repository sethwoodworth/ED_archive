On May 22nd 2008, a lulzy [[v/|/v/irgin]] and [[LJ]] dramawhore named [http://lexyeevee.livejournal.com/ Lexeevee] and a [[bullshit|talented]] [[DA|Tartlet]] (aka [[oxymoron]]) named [http://purplekecleon.deviantart.com/ PurpleKecleon] decided to devise an experiment to test and record the feeding frenzy of faggotry that takes place when [[Anonymous]] drops the [[drama bomb]] on a particularly twitchy fan community. KC painted an alternative form for the Pokéymans called Shaymin, based on a description that had been published on the website [http://www.pokebeach.com Pokebéach.] She then overlaid [[moonspeak]] on it, printed it out on glossy paper and took a blurry photograph of it. Finally, Vee then posted it to 4chan /v/.

{{quote|I would like to emphasize that neither of us ever claimed that this was a confirmed Nintendo Pokémon, or from an official source, or in any other way real. No source, no poster name, no explanation or message at all; the image was posted naked as a new thread. Again, we never claimed or even implied that the image was a real Pokémon.|Lexyeevee}}

Over the next twenty-four hours, the results were carefully documented. The results read like a sad indictment of internet culture. They are reproduced here from the timeline on Vee's blog, with reverence for his services to the lulz.

==Timeline==
'''2:58 PM''' Original /v/ post.<br>
'''3:06 PM''' /v/ post Imageshacked and linked from Gamefaqs, citing /v/ as [[sauce]].<br>
'''3:47 PM''' /v/ post Imageshacked again and linked from [http://community.livejournal.com/pokemon/ LJ Pokémon.] Sauce named as [[2chan]].<br>
'''4:00 PM''' A breakthrough. After an entire thirteen minutes of inactivity the image is stolen by Pokébeach, stamped with their watermark and reported as front page news. The sauce is given as LJ User [http://heerosferret.livejournal.com/ HeerosFerret,] and no credit is given to /v/ or the LJ Pokémon community.<br>
'''4:07 PM''' A bare two hours and nine minutes after the original /v/ post - [[rule 34|RULE 34]] ON SKY FORME SHAYMIN!!!!!!!!!1<br>
'''4:11 PM''' The second Imageshack link is lifted from LJ Pokémon and uploaded to the website [[Bulbagarden]]. No sauce named.<br>
'''4:26 PM''' First fanart of Sky Forme Shaymin appears on DA. Names it as OFFICIAL NEW POKÉMON, and gives sauce as 4chan. Lol wut.<br>
'''4:28 PM''' Original photo posted to Pokémon forums at [http://www.serebiiforums.com Serebii.com.] No sauce given.<br>
'''4:36 PM''' Imageshack link spreads to forums at [[Smogon]]. Sauce named as Pokébeach.<br>
'''5:16 PM''' Pokébeach image circulated via IRC.<br>
'''6:23 PM''' Excitable stampeding trendwhores upload Pokébeach image to DA. Hastily deleted for [[lol|some unknown reason.]]<br>
'''6:30-7:00 PM''' Original /v/ thread expires, and the paperchase back to Anon is severed permanently.<br>
'''2:43 AM''' The news sites start to shit themselves. Serebii speedily edits his article and covers it in "This is almost certainly a hoax" warnings in a desperate attempt to save face.<br>
'''6:36 AM''' Moar DA fanart.<br>
'''6:48 AM''' Pokébeach image re-uploaded to DA with the watermarked hacked off. Re-deleted just as fast.<br>
'''4-6 AM''' The story continues to spread across the blogs.<br>
'''1:27 PM''' Less than twenty-four hours after the original post, Sky Forme Shaymin reaches [http://www.furaffinity.net Fur Affinity.] All hope is lost.

==Vee's Conclusions==

In final [[anal]]olysis, Lexyeevee made the following observations based on his results.

#It was amazing to watch how markedly little suspicion the fake Pokémon met. Even 4chan - the home of "Looks shooped," "Pics or it didn't happen" and "GTFO newfag" - threw up only a handful of naysayers.
#Curiously, the fact that the /v/ post was of someone holding the picture up to the camera actually ''caused'' people to accuse it of being faked rather than adding to its air of authenticity.
#Serebii and Pokébeach getting into a giant pissing contest, calling each other out, bitching about sauce and generally trying to be the most super special awesome Pokémon site on the internet served as a big catalyst.
#Sadly the story was not carried by the site "Bulbanews"; because Vee notes that he uses their news feed for Pokémon updates, and it would have been [[Epic Win]] for his own hoax to arrive back on his own front page within a day via a chain of third parties.

==So What Did We Learn?==

Absolutely nothing, but lulz were had. I wonder [[Youtube poop|What's for dinner?]]
