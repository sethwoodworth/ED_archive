'''PC Gamers''' are [[basement dweller|HARDCORE GAMERS]]. They are graphics hardware [[Nazi|Nazis]] who [[fap]] to games that require a [[retarded|retardedly]] expensive PC to run. Only people suffering from a serious lack of brains would reasonably spend [[over 9,000]] dollars to soup up some shitty eMachines or Dell monstrosity that will become obsolete within a month for the sole purpose of [[nerd|playing games]]. PC Gamers are more concerned with [[Shit nobody cares about|benchmarks, specs and hardware]] than the games themselves, which is why they play shitty [[Crysis|tech demos]] disguised as games.

==PC Gamers: Identifiable Traits ==
PC gamers are an unusual breed, a subspecies of [[Fag|''Nerdus americanus'']], which are renowned for their game [[molesting|loving]]. However, PC gamers are even [[gay|gayer]] than other species of [[nerds]]. Most specimens of gamer tend to be [[basement dwellers]]. A PC gamer's lair is often a dark, shit-smelling room in the basement of their mother's house.

These types of gamers are very [[you|undateable]]. Most PC Gamers settle for [[hentai|a 2D drawing of a loli]], or pictures of [[camwhores]]. When gamers do get [[hawt]] n' raunchy, they often engage in [[facepalm|facepalmingly]] embarrassing [[cybersex]] with [[fat]] [[furries]], which is often called [[fap]]ping to [[Habbo Hotel]].

[[lie|Girls can be PC gamers too.]]

They tend to be somewhat belligerent, while mainly comparing their computers like they would compare their [[dong|dicks]], even when the reality is that their penis is as useless as their computer. 

[[Angry_German_Kid|Most PC Gamers]] will fly into a [[rage]] over certain technological limitations that causes serious [[butthurt]] when a [[hacker]] comes into play. 

Most games that PC Gamers play are [[fps|first-person shooters]]. The object of these games is to kill as many people [[IRL]] to become heroes. Many [[fanboys]] have taken up this venerable challenge and all have become [[an hero|an heroes]] to satisfy their needs for losing their [[Mitchell Henderson|iPod]].

Some PC Gamers will overclock their PCs. This means they are willing to put thousands of dollars worth of hardware at risk for a few extra FPS in ''[[Battletoads|Doom 3]]'', and a slightly larger [[Epenis|e-penis]].

PC Gamers are also known to buy cases with transparent sides and fill them with pointless neon lights, in order to show off how [[fail|awesome]] their [[crap|gaming rig]] is.

== Building Your Own ==
Possibly the most outstanding showing of nerdom possible is to actually build your own computer, with the exception of doing the aforementioned and putting fucking Linux on it. 

== Companies That Will Build for You ==
Here are the two companies that are most likely to fuck [[you|you]] in the ass. 
[[Shit|Alienware]], a [[Bitch| subsidiary]] of [[Jews|Dell]], is a computer building company that [[Apple|charges way too fucking much for its computers]]. Related closely to iBuyPower, CyberPowerPC, and Vigor Gaming (lol robbed), Alienware's objective is to [[buttsecks|fuck you in the ass]] with prices. With computers that cost ten grand that can be built by Nerd Kings for a mere one and a half, and nearly all the publicity as opposed to how to actually build one's computer, it is obvious why so many console users look down on PC users as rich, stupid, or otherwise nerdy as hell. Given the fact that most console players are weed-smoking niggers that you meet over [[Halo|Halo 3]] or [[Call of Duty|Cock of Doody 4]], it's also a good note that nobody gives a shit what they think. They'll [[Dying Alone|die alone]].
== Alienware ==
Though the Alienware case is badass. You can change the colour of LEDs on the front panel that make the case glow. The only drawback is the lack of the case window, and owning the case makes you look like a PC newfag. 
== Vigor Gaming ==
With flagship rig the [[Fat|Colossus]] beginning at six grand, you can be sure that this is the only company giving Alienware such a strong running for who is going to [[Jews|pwn your money the most]]. However, with the [[Ninja|Stealth]] model beginning at $600, they do attempt to redeem themselves. Too bad the Stealth is a piece of [[shit|shit]]. Vigor gaming's warehouse was burglarized around early 2010 due to [[fail|lax]] security and is now permanently closed down.


== Windows ==
[[Windows|Windows]] is the primary OS of PC gaming, although recently [[Steam|Steam]] has moved to be compatible with Macs as well. [[Unwarranted self-importance|PC gamers usually display an extreme adeptness for working with and cleaning, and basically performing routine maintenance on Windows other users are too lazy or stupid to do, and will often brag uncontrollably about it]].
