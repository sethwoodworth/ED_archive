'''FakeSagan''' (aka ''HardCaseOwnsYou'', aka Chris) is a [[BDSM|masochistic]] [[atheist]] who 
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UzMR103Exo wants people to make fun of the sound of his voice, lisp and teeth], and is a <s>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZEA2ANEjko confessed bestialist]</s>.  A construction worker [[IRL]] and distant cousin of FireFly515 (he is from the [[Austin|South]] after all), he enjoys [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC2J4HtADxQ calling young hydrocephalic girls ''"Balloon Heads"''].  HardCaseOwnsYou [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKNXjfpBoHI claims diminished responsibility] for what he posts on [[YouTube]] as he is constantly high on [[alcohol|booze]] and [[crack|crystal meth]].  He will however [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsIXNZqk1ek play Nada Surf songs off-key at you if you hate on him].  

As a Philosophy Major, naturally HardCaseOwnsYou now works in the construction industry.


Fakesagan appeared on The Oprah Winfrey show on an episode which explored the conditions in which drug addicts live. He was presented as a crack addicted man of 30 years old who lived under a bridge and had to give blowjobs for money to buy drugs. This episode however never actually aired due to the fact that "fakesagan", when brought on the set, punched a cameraman leaving this poor man in a coma. Luckily the man has since awoken from the coma, however he has recently died sortly after being released from hospital due to injuries sustained from a beating he received (with brass knuckles) from none other than Fakesagan himself wanting to "finish the job". 

HardCase sounds unbelievably nasally; imagine a stoned Yogi Bear with a head cold, and you will get an approximation of HardCase's horribly annoying voice.

A keen [[emo|Alkaline Trio Fan]] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsIXNZqk1ek Alkaline Trio Message Board User], HardCase spends most of his time on YouTube [[fapping|masturbating]] over '''Brett Keane''' and making [[9000|numerous]] videos to him, begging for the attention of the [[man]] that HardCaseOwnsYou refers to as ''"The Atheist Jesus"''. HardCaseOwnsYou is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC2J4HtADxQ frightened and depressed that BrettKeane has children and HardCaseOwnsYou doesn't], he often claims that other YouTubers are [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsIXNZqk1ek jealous because Brett Keane likes him more than them], and that he can [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsIXNZqk1ek totally mess up people's reputation because he is a member of many messageboards].

<br/>
==Even more [[TL;DW]] than [[TheMaskedAnalyst]]==
HardCaseOwnsYou is a serious waster of [[internets]] bandwidth who begged [[JezuzFreek777]] to commit [[suicide]] in one of his many [[TL;DW]] videos.  HardCaseOwnsYou even made a video to [[TheMaskedAnalyst]] asking for advice on [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygqh_-e4EEM how to make his videos even longer].  He also spent a 23 minute video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmY85TV7yCc promoting user anangel13], who simply stands in front of the camera and says very little of worth, with only her [[tits|ample chest]] full-frame (a good thing as she is a [[retard|stupid]] albeit large-titted [[women|woman]]).

==HardCaseOwnsYou Owns Himself==
In a moment of unbelievable genius HardCaseOwnsYou [[pwnd]] himself in his [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQsLioP7efg very first YouTube video] when he took part in the [[Blasphemy Challenge]].  Whilst proudly demonstrating that he is incapable of using an iron, HardCase denied the existence of the [[goatse|Holy Spirit]] as he pompously placed his hand on the "Gospel according to [[Carl Sagan]]".  HardCaseOwnsYou made the mistake that is common amongst [[atheist|atheists]]: he believed Carl Sagan was an [[atheist]], when in fact [http://www.adherents.com/people/ps/Carl_Sagan.html Carl Sagan was an agnostic, as well just an all-around better fucking person]...which is particularly amusing as HardCase''' [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UzMR103Exo hates agnostics and thinks they are stupid]'''. '''[[Lulz]] [[irony|Irony!!!]]'''
[[Image:HardSagan.jpg|thumb|right|280px|When you die, the first thing you'll see is [[Carl Sagan]] bitchslapping your sorry ass for ever using his works like this.]]
The [[irony]] continues when you notice that HardCaseOwnsYou proudly displays an Ourben quote on his profile ''"...people in religion think atheism is a religion, but it aint; it's something that happens to people when they start thinking for themselves."'' - Yes, that's right HardCaseOwnsYou - '''think for yourself'''. Now go put more of someone else's words proudly on your profile page.

==Flawed Logic==
Like most [[atheist|atheists]] HardCaseOwnsYou is an atheist because '''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UzMR103Exo the dedication to strict logical accuracy required to be agnostic is too great]'''.  [[atheist|Atheists]] claim knowledge of something unknowable in the same way [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]] claim knowledge of something unknowable.

"And similarly, like [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]], [[atheist|atheists]] cannot read between the lines of religious texts, and must take everything literally and not see its inherent esoteric nature.  This proves they are in fact [[retards]]. Like, for example, saying that the story of Adam and Eve is a big lie because EVERYONE KNOWS SNAKES CAN'T TALK, LOL!1! And when the bible tells us to stone gays, it doesnt necessarily mean with rocks. It could just as well be with flowers or porn.

HardCaseOwnsYou is intellectually bankrupt and makes no sense.  As any [[EDiot|reasonable person]] knows, atheism is one big appeal to authority, the authority being [[science]].  HardCase is a [[sheep|follower]].

HardCaseOwnsYou is his own worst enemy.  It is great whenever he opens his mouth to speak as he does more to encourage agnosticism than any agnostic ever could.  Like all [[atheist|atheists]] HardCaseOwnsYou is an enemy of reason who is jealous of agnostics' use of [[science]], [[logic]] and critical thinking. HardCase is often [[pwnd]] by [[agnostics]] and has said [[9000|numerous]] times '''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UzMR103Exo “Wow.  That really makes a lot of sense.  I feel owned by that]'''.

Like all [[atheist|atheists]], HardCaseOwnsYou forgets to have a sense of humor and loves to refer to himself as '''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE5O5uyaF4s "a Saint of Science, who is going to change the world"'''].  HardCaseOwnsYou also '''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UzMR103Exo has a plan to distribute copies of Dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard into all hotel rooms in the US]'''.

==Trolled by His Own Subscribers==

Seeing as he ''"Didn't give a Fucking Fuck"'' about his ED article, HardCase thought it was appropriate to upload a {{youtube|TuR8ne9aVLg|14min:33sec video rebuttal}} that was a doubled speed / doubled pitch video (and still TL;DW).  However after all his subscribers complained that he made no sense, HardCaseOwnsYou confused this assertion with his doubling of the speed & pitch and therefore uploaded {{youtube|pE5O5uyaF4s|the full 29 minute [[TL;DW]] version}}, in which he proudly said that he is bringing the good news that ''"God is Dead"'', when in fact everyone has known this since Friedrich Nietzsche's Madman proclaimed it in 1882 in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead The Gay Science], and even if he missed this due to his illiteracy -  it was later announced on the cover of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead Time Magazine in 1966].

==FakeSagan==

[[image:fscomment.png|thumb|right|260px|'''Fakesagan''' summed up.]]]
 
[[Image:Hardcasepengies.jpg|thumb|right|260px|'''Fakesagan''' loves [[danielspengies|trolls]]]]
2 days after overreacting to this article, HardcaseOwnsYou closed his account.  Being the [[attention whore]] that he is, this barely lasted a month.  He returned under the username FakeSagan, wearing some kind of [[faggotry|mask]], [[TheRedSkull|Redskull]] anyone?

Under his new name of "fakesagan", a reference to his deranged fanboyism of [[Carl Sagan]], he now acts differently to the way he did as HardCase, in so much he is now nothing but a complete and utter troll, probably because he has nothing to do now that Brett Keane came under the banhammer. Here's a summary of his videos as fakesagan if you find them all [[tl;dr]]:


* Believes that a man's actions reveal his character. This is why he chooses to insult people rather than rationally discuss theological subjects on YouTube and  [[Deleting_your_Youtube_Videos|deleted his videos and closed his YouTube account]] after wishing [[TheAmazingAtheist]]'s dog would die.  

* Called some rich [[Mexican]] guy whose family got death threats IRL a pussy.

* Got totally [[pwned]] by a [[Inmendham|scraggly haired old guy]] who lives in a trailer, despite the help of over 9000 of his other atheist friends joining in. (NOTE: totally pwned, in this instance, means the guy kept on and on replying).

* Asked a [[camwhore]] who is a stripper IRL to fuck him or something. Got [[butthurt]] when she told him to [[GTFO]].  Subsequently pwned the camwhore and caused her to close her YouTube account.  Doing this made him feel like a big man.

* Produced a [[boring|legendary]] moment by spitting in a [[Allah|Koran]]. While trolling of Muslims is most certainly lulzy, what FakeSagan fails to realize is that it's also incredibly easy and the fact that he managed to piss a lot of them off isn't the [[unwarranted self importance|great achievement he seems to think it is]].

* Is dating <s>the cousin</s> a former one night stand of [[CapnOAwesome]], who has a [http://uk.youtube.com/user/OshunAvani YouTube account] 

* He did, however, pwn the living shit out of the leader of the ever-annoying [[Rational Response Squad]], so much so that Sapient spent at least 100 minutes saying how he "could beat him but didn't have the time". For that, this EDiot tips his hat to HardFakeCaseSagan.

* Going to have a boxing match in Seattle with CapnOAwesome. It seems Capn just wants it to be fun, but fakesagan actually wants to beat the shit out of him, so Fakesagan decided to make it bare knuckle instead. No one cares who wins so long as they both do serious damage to each other.

* Campaigned to free [[TheMaskedAnalyst]] from the [[DMCA]] [[terror]] of [[TheRedSkull]]!!! <br/><br/>
<big>FREE [[TheMaskedAnalyst|THE MASKED ANALYST]]</big>

[[Image:Tma2point0.JPG|thumb|right|[[themaskedanalyst]] responds, "I would argue this is against [[TOS]].."]]

[[Image:Ninjahardcase.jpg|center]]

* After briefly being fired from his position as [[TheAmazingAtheist]]'s prison bitch, he promised to [[pwn]] him...but all he did after taking one of his "two week breaks" was shrug it off (probably because the [[buttsecks]] is too good) and instead go after [[CapnOAwesome]] for being more popular than him and obviously mattering to his girlfriend more than he does.

* Has recently started a relationship with fellow [[YouTube]] [[atheist]] [[Camwhore| OshunAvani]].  While some might consider it a minor miracle that FakeSagan's goofy ass managed to score any [[pussy]] at all, it should be noted that [[Camwhore| OshunAvani]] is an [[alcoholic]] hosebeast with an irritating southern drawl, so he didn't exactly hit the jackpot in the girlfriend sweepstakes.

[[Image:Turtlenekownsyou.jpg|thumb|right|Jesus had a crown of thorns - HardCase has a turtleneck.]]
[[Image:Fakesaganonlyfriend.jpg|thumb|right|'''FakeSagan''' gazes lovingly at his [[drunk|only friend]].]]
[[Image:NoIron.jpg|thumb|right|"Ironing is for theists!!!!]]
* Fakesagan's [[semen]] is a sickly, yellowish spew with an unpleasant taste and odor.  Fortunately, [[Camwhore|OshunAvani]] is usually heavily sedated during their sexual encounters and doesn't complain when he nuts (weakly) in her mouth.

* Has never dated a woman with an appreciable [[boob|bust]], unless you count [[TheAmazingAtheist]].  

* Failed [[stripper|strippers]], [[camwhores]], and overweight [[goth]] chicks are turned on by his large, prominent adam's apple.  What they don't realize is that they are actually seeing [[TheAmazingAtheist]]'s testicles which broke off and got lodged in Fakesagan's throat years ago during one of their coke-fueled skull-fucking sessions. 

* Due to the recent downturn in the economy, and its effect on the construction industry, fakesagan has taken to selling naked pictures of [[Camwhore|OshunAvani]] in order to make ends meet.  So far, only [[inmendham]] has bought one, because that long-haired freak will [[masturbation|fap]] to anything.

* In his [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C6DjQufmRg most recent video], he admitted that he ripped off his heroes Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the creators of [[South Park]] - his favorite show.  He also revealed that he despises [[Michael Moore]], and identifies himself as a right-winger.  He also wore a stupid hat because "the bitchez loves a nigga with style."

* Has never not gotten a job he's applied for.  This is because he gives superb [[fellatio|blow jobs]].  

* Has a stupid [[tattoo]] of some sort of flaming head on his right arm.  This symbolizes his flaming [[faggotry]], obviously.

* Has high hopes that his sign-off, "Keep it fake," will become the [[vlog]] equivalent of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Murrow Edward R. Murrow's] famous "Good night and good luck."  This is unlikely to happen, as it is a fucking retarded sign-off.

* In a change of pace from his typical croaking pontifications and petty [[drama]]/bitch fests, fakesagan's [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUR0vKb5_FE latest video] finds him playing the character of a sleazy promoter for some grease-pig boxer.  It is excruciatingly unfunny, and is only worth mentioning because [[Camwhore|OshunAvani]] appears in it as a cheap [[slut]].  Since she is a cheap [[slut]] [[IRL]], it is unclear if she was playing a role or if she just happened to wander into the shot.

* Is an only child, which might explain his social awkwardness and [[attention whore|need for attention]].  Others speculate that [[Camwhore|OshunAvani]]'s constant [[whore|whoring]] has undermined his confidence, and he feels the only way he can reclaim his manhood is through internet [[drama]].

* Decided not to complete his [[philosophy]] degree because he wanted to "keep it real."  Went into construction because he figured he could advance rapidly in the industry (as his only competition would be felons and greasy, illiterate [[Mexico|wetbacks]]).  Now he lives in a state of perpetual anxiety because he suspects the [[Mexican]] laborers he works with are pissing in his coffee and [[gangbang|gangbanging]] his girlfriend every time his back is turned.

* Recently ascended the soapbox of his [[YouTube]] [http://www.youtube.com/user/fakesagan?ob=1 channel comments] to rail against the "oil barons and market speculators" who are ruining the economy and stealing from the American working man.  On the one hand, he made some good points about governmental and economic corruption.  On the other hand, he is nothing more than a construction-worker-[[vlog|vlogger]]-[[cuckold]]-[[fucktard]] who needs to [[STFU]] and quit acting like he knows what he's talking about.

* Little known fact:  [[Camwhore|OshunAvani]] was born a man, but had an [[transgender|"operation"]] performed in March of 2008. Since he's [[homosexuality|into dudes]], Fakesagan was not completely on board with the whole thing, but vowed to stick by Oshun because he fell in [[love]] with the inner [[transgender|her/him]].

* It was rumored that Fakesagan [[Sexual Harassment|sexually harassed]] some bleached blonde [[skank]] named Strangeholm (now [http://www.youtube.com/user/StrangeGlobal StrangeGlobal] - send her a salacious PM, she'll get a kick out of it) who used to be [[Camwhore|OshunAvani]]'s [[lesbian]] lover. Fakesagan [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15ijGPBACw recently took to the YouTubes] to confirm that the rumor is true and add that he fucked her with his pet weasel, or something.

* Contributed an unremarkable foreword to [[TheAmazingAtheist]]'s unfunny and frankly repellent book [[Shit|"Scumbag: Musings Of A Subhuman"]]  (Download it [http://thepiratebay.org/tor/3840320/Scumbag__Musings_of_a_Subhuman here] - you wouldn't want to pay for this shit.)  The Fakesagan's conclusion?  [[TheAmazingAtheist]] is "''willing to make himself the focal point of our resentment so long as it empowers us to examine our own lives and begin healing ourselves.  (He) is a modern shaman.''"  The reader's conclusion?  [[Homosexuality|Butt-buddies]].

* Claimed to be an anarchist after watching [http://www.eurekatube.net/ confederalsocialist's] videos, and hosted them on his channel when they got [http://www.youtube.com/confederalsocialist baleeted]. He was then [[Shocked_and_Appalled|shocked and appalled]] to hear that CS didn't consider him an [[anarchy|anarchist]] after he said "I'm not really an anarchist." In a fit of butthurtz fakesagan took CS's videos off his channel and accused CS of dropping [http://www.youtube.com/brainpolice2 Alexander F Strekel's] name, who has the same ISP as a [http://www.youtube.com/theracemixer colostomy bag] that claimed to file the [[DMCA]]'s against confederalsocialist.

* Bitched about [[TheAmazingAtheist]] becoming a youtube ad partner [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiuwWNC8FaU&feature=channel_page|as can be seen here]] and then became an ad partner himself, [[http://img410.imageshack.us/img410/7678/sellout.png|as can be seen here]].

* Isn't just an anarchist, but is a [[Ron Paul]] style survivalist anarchist, who is moving to [[the south]] to live on a farm, stacking up on gold, tobacco and guns awaiting Armageddon. 

* Recently proved his truly is as smart as a donkey by taking drugs for everyone to see on blog.tv, and then making fun of someone else for taking drugs themselves.

* Got butthurt when internet superpimp AMatingMind trolled his sorry ass on blogtv.  Nearly shit his pants in fear when AMatingMind threatened his life and his relationship.  Tried unsuccessfully to ban AMatingMind, but the wily troll kept coming back to undermine all of Fakesagan's efforts and strike fear in his dissipated heart.  FUCK YOU, FAKESAGAN!

==Internet Z-Lister==
Fakesagan has now reached 7,000 [[idiot|subscribers]] thanks to CapnOAwesome banging his girlfriend and having him pitch a bitch-fit over it, and oh yeah, his constant [[drama|fighting and drama]].  By [[sex|engaging with every single]] YouTuber with over 11 [[fag|subscribers]], [[TheAmazingAtheist]] favoriting all of his videos and telling people he was a member of the KKK and owns his own <strike>house</strike> <strike>apartment</strike> shed - he has risen to become a true [[fail|YouTube Z-Lister]]. Everytime he gains another 1,000 subscribers he does a [[fail|"questions"]] video, but never answers even half of them, which annoys his brain dead subscribers [[an hero|who can't live]] without knowing what fakesagan's [[2girls1cup|"favorite flavor of ice cream is"]]. He's become popular enough that [[katiesopinion]] is subscribed to him and even comments on his videos with brilliant contributions to the <s>intellectual debates</s> [[ad hominem]]s with things such as [[gay|"Nice haircut"]] and [[fail|"Put the rug back on the wall"]]. TheBoringDispatcher also thought him worthy of a video, which fakesagan responded to by [[unwarranted self importance|reading ''Moby Dick'']].

He also revealed recently that he cares very deeply about the factual accuracy of his ED article. So if in the future this article describes one of his foes as a "duplicitous, callow, simpering, psuedointelluctual, subwhoring, yappy, quivering, fugly, trifling, meglomanical, petty, demagogic pussbag weasel", he's probably made an account.

In the last month or so he hasn't even signed into his YouTube account, let alone made a video, probably because he's BAWWWing over [[TheAmazingAtheist]] saying [[Saturninefilms]] gives better blowjobs than him. It is estimated that about 4 people have noticed. It is highly likely he has created another account so he can eagerly watch [[drama]] videos all day whilst giving the impression he isn't a [[basement dweller]].

[[Image:Capnfuckingfakesagansgirlfriend2.JPG|thumb|right|230px|"Oh baby"]]

In a recent atheist [[flame war]] news, it was revealed that [[CapnOAwesome]] fucked FakeSagan's [[kitchen|girlfriend]] [[IRL]]. Capn was [[butthurt|hurt]] that OshunAvani left him for another gangly, anorexic atheist so in a stroke of Machiavellian [[genius]] he challenged FakeSagan to a boxing match and then used a [[shock_image|sex tape]] of himself and OshunAvani to blackmail her into preventing the fight.  The ploy was a [[winrar|success]] but Capn ended up releasing the footage anyway after he found a new [[homeless|apartment.]]  As he explained to his audience on Livevideo:

===Fake Sagan Responds===
Returning from a sworn YouTube 6 month hiatus, and taking the opportunity to milk the [[moralfag|moral high ground]], Chris chose to, instead, make the thrust of his response to Kevin a call for a return to their previous [[Epic Fail|'let's box IRL' gimmick instead]].

==[[Disregard that]]==

[[Image:DirtyAtheists.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[Typical]] summation of atheist faggotry and [[fanboys|viewership]] on the tubes.]]
Following the [[drama]] and rush of [[Cry moar|indignant]] bullshit that flooded the YouTube [[cesspool]] shortly after Capn dropped his [[lulz]] bomb, he [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|tucked tail and ran]], declining FakeSagan's challenge.  The [[Nobody cares|reasons]] surrounding his account closing is a matter of current speculation, but amid the mostly [[hypocrite|hypocritical]] outcry to this sordid affair from YT's Atheist "community" there came, of course, an {{youtube|qQ7xFknFUEs|overblown response}} from [[TheAmazingAtheist]].  Never one to miss a chance to resume their ongoing endless 3-way death match (or a meal), TJ (TheAmazingAtheist) jumped at the opportunity to potentially pwn CapnOAwesome himself over the matter.  Most of his [[USI|tirade]] is him listing, in detail, the different ways in which he would like to see Kevin die [[pain series|horribly]], whilst still finding time to talk about CapnOAwesome's [[penis]]...as well as his own shortcomings in that area. 
{{quote|1=I mean the only time you see your penis is just very briefly just as it's entering in...and you can only see 'this' much|2=[[TheAmazingAtheist]]|3=apparently disappointed}}
Capn's closing may have been a result of [[troll's remorse]], or perhaps a realization of the [[stupidity]] of putting a video of yourself [[fucking]] on the internet in the first place.  Though it's most [[common_knowledge|likely]] that the prospect of actually having to face FakeSagan in a boxing match made Kevin a little [[ZOMG|nervous]].  In closing his account he [[footbullet|ceded]] much of the thorough [[pwnage]] he had achieved at that point.  <strike>Whether he will return and reopen his jewtubes is still [[SNCA|up in the air]].</strike> Disregard that, the [http://www.youtube.com/user/CapnOAwesome Capn's back].

==Fakesagan's [[sockpuppet]] wankery==
Unable to realise [[VIP|vandalism]] is completely fucking pointless poor old Fakesagan has repeatedly tried to get his page and the pages of his other heathen buddies removed.  As a good strategy, Fakesagan figures the best way to do this is to use the same name repeatedly:

{{squote|[[USI|Fakesagan is now a prime example of intelligence, masculinity and good looks.  He's so popular people literally line up to kiss his ass.

So this page really does not have to be up anymore.  Okay?  You know, maybe this page can just hyperlink to fakesagans youtube page.  Think of that?  He actually gets advertising as well.

==Fakesagan gets Banned ==
[[Image:Fakesagan_Howdawurlwerks_YouTube_pm.png|thumb|right|[[Nice try]].]]
Most likely due to drama surrounding the [[TheAmazingAtheist]]/Fakesagan [[flame war]] with YouTube atheist and crybaby extraordinaire [[Coughlan666]], or possibly due to DMCA's filed against him for a reposting of one of coughlan's videos, Fakesagan got raped by the banhammer on June 1st, [[2009]].  [[Some argue|Speculation]] surrounding a suspected flagging campaign against Fakesagan on behalf of Coughlan's [[fanboys]] abounds and bawwwfests from [[TheAmazingAtheist|TAA]] are likely to hit the tubes immediately.  Whether Chris will try and regain his place in the greasy [[taint]] of the YouTube atheist community and start all over again at the bottom in that endless search for "[[pwnage|pownage]]" is [[SNCA|yet to be seen]].  

'''Update''':

And just as mysteriously as he was banned, he was unbanned within the next day, on June 2nd, [[2009]]. This is probably due to {{youtube2|HowDaWorldTwerks|a certain user}} dropping a YouTube administrators [[dox]] on one of his videos, allowing all of the TAA's [[fanboys]] to [[text]]spam said administrator's cell phone.  

'''Another Update''':

[[Disregard that|Nevermind]], he was RE-BANNED the same day and efforts to coerce the [[YouTube Staff]] into reinstating Fakesagan were to no avail, he can go back to spackling walls and installing plumbing now.

===Update 09-16-2010===
It appears he has left JewTube [[BRB|for good]], watch this space for [[Shit nobody cares about|further details.]]

==Flag This!==

Like any other self respecting person who refers to themselves in the third person, Fakesagan, now retitling himself as Hardcase, decided to man-up after his YouTube channel was banned by spreading nice and wide for theAmazingAtheist and to whore himself out onto tjvids (and so that no-one can flag his shitty videos).

Being a big man, he decided to prove how good it is in the South by shooting his gun in the forest miles away from civilization, wearing a military costume he bought for 13 dollars at Wal-Mart, shame he didn't shoot himself in the foot and bleed out or something. Oh, he also said something about being jealous about gimmeabreakman and how he earned all his subscribers whilst Fakesagan had to give theAmazingAtheist his brass-eye without a reach around.

Just a quick note, FakeSagan said that you cannot flag his video's on tjvids.com, I wonder if he realized that you can do so on the website that hosts his vids?

==FakeSagan, TheAmazingAtheist, and the 6,6,6, BTV show==

In an effort to raise money for Free Speech Videos, FakeSagan and TheAmazingAtheist hosted a BlogTv session which essentially was one elaborate e-begging attempt.  After their pathetic e-begging didn't go anywhere, FakeSagan literally made out with TheAmazingAtheist for a mere one hundred and fifty dollars. This is often the result when you put two imbreds together.

 Afterwards, Fakesagan continued to get totally shitfaced and begun [[Emo|to cut his arm]]. They literally had to call the paramedics to deal with his ass. The Amazing Atheist intially left a witty note saying "Fakesagan died tonight. too much bloodloss. I am shocked and horrified." However, It had been later confirmed he had indeed gone in for medical treatment, which he has needed for a very long time. This was all recorded for everyone to see: <center><youtube>kj8cLMtheaU</youtube></center>

Fakesagan [[fact|isn't dead]], he was on another [[TheAmazingAtheist]] blog tv a week later, therefore Fakesagan is NOT [[An Hero]]... yet.

In a recent blog TV room. Fakesagan admitted he joined the KKK and began showing his [[Noob|master]] noose tying skills. But in a frantic noose tying race against racist youtuber [[Shit Nobody Cares About|RVism]] fakesagan accidentally tied a noose around his neck and was strangled to death. The Doctors were unable to [[Burn|fix]] his body but they removed his brain and put it inside a [[horse|horse]] that [[ugly|looked just like him]].

[[Peta|Peta]] later filed a lawsuit against the hospital that it was unjustifiably cruel to give a horse the mind of an idiot.  

*Update*
Fakesagan was later kicked out of the KKK  for being a [[wigger|wigger]].
