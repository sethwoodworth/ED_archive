Playstation 2
[[Image:Ps2.jpg|thumb|Did anyone ever use that pointless stand?]]

The ''<b>Sony PlayStation 2</b>'', known by unfunny [[13 year old boys]] as the "[[Gay]]station [[shit|Poo]]", was Sony's
second console in the video game console wars. Most of its fanbase consisted of [[soccer moms]], [[weeaboos]], [[Microsoft]] haters, Wayne Brady, and pretty much anyone looking for the sane middle ground between "[[gamecube|LOLOLOLOL SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE IS SO FUN! OMG SHUT UP MOM!]]" and "[[XBox|YO MUTHAFUCKAS HALO IS DA SHIT! IM GON' SHOOT SUM NIGGAS!]]". This was because the PS2 was sort of a mixture of the [[Xbox]] and the [[Gamecube]] when it came to its game library. Unfortunately its bulky younger brother, the [[PS3]], made most of its fanbase migrate to the [[Xbox 360]].

==History==
[[Image:Ps1andps2tapedtogether.jpg|thumb|Sony's early vision of backwards compatibility]]
Ever since the Nintendo 64 came out, Sony had been working on a new console to beat the shit out of their rival Nintendo. Instead of going with something original, they just decided to call it the <b>Playstation 2</b>. Because of the promise of graphics so good that they would be like "plugging into the [[Matrix]]" (seriously), backwards compatibility, and a DVD player, people jumped on them like a bunch of horny [[furries]] about to get into a [[furpile]]. The popularity of the <b>Playstation 2</b> was so great that its only rival, the [[Dreamcast]], was given the smack down, and it never recovered. For the rest of its lifespan, the <b>Playstation 2</b> only had one real competitor, the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]], because [[Nintendo]] obviously thought they could win by making a [[wii|half assed console and selling it for half the price]] of a <b>Playstation 2</b> and an [[Xbox]]. The [[Xbox]] and the <b>Playstation 2</b> competed with each other quite well. Even today the <b>Playstation 2</b> somehow manages to drag its ass along with JRPG's and shitty ports of [[360]]/[[PS3]] games.

==Memorable Games==
[[Image:Grandtheftemo.jpg|thumb|The Playstation 2's best selling game.]]
Here are some of the memorable games the PS2 had to offer. Feel free to add any as long as it wasn't multiplatform (excluding San Andreas).

*<b>''Dragon Quest VIII''</b> - This King gets turned into a miniature version of [[DBZ|Piccolo]] and you must cure him. It's that simple.
*<b>''[[San Andreas|Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''</b> - Being a black person and stealing shit has never been so fun!
*<b>''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''</b> - The heartless are destroying planets, and the inhabitants' only hope is a kid with bad hair and clown shoes who fights with an oversized house key, along with a bunch of fucktarded Disney characters.
*<b>''[[Katamari Damacy]]''</b> - All the stars in the sky have been accidentally destroyed and somehow hurling big balls of trash into the sky will fix this.
*<b>''[[Final Fantasy|Final Fantasy X]]''</b> - This big sea monster thing forms from everyone's sins, and you must stop it and turn into it ten years later, except it was all just a dream, except parts of it weren't and one of the characters was actually dead the whole time. [[Yes|Easy to follow right?]]
*<b>''[[Pretty cool guy|Jak]] and [[Furry|Daxter]]''</b> - Like Ratchet and Clank, except actually fun to play.
*<b>''Persona 3''</b> - Better than Persona 4, you fight demons by [[an hero|shooting yourself in the head]].
*<b>''Persona 4''</b> - People are being killed by being dropped inside televisions and you must go into the TV, fight [[Double nigger|shadow thingies]] and rescue them.
*<b>''Devil May Cry''</b> - You play as an albino dude with a huge ego, a fucking sword, [[WIN|guns with infinite ammo]], and [[pretty cool guy|doesn´t afraid of demons and furries]]; the second one is filled with DIESEL shit, so don´t bother even watching it on Jewtube. In the third one you can also play as his [[Gay|evil]] twin brother, so [[Truth|it's the best out of all the three games]]
*<b>''Clock Tower 3''</b> - Play a fifteen year old girl who is stalked by [[pedophile|creepy old man serial killers]] and is [[almost raped]] by her grandfather. This instalment caused destroyed the franchise and caused alot of an heros.
*<b>''Gran Turismo 3''</b> - Drive cars around in a circle.
*<b>''Gran Turismo 4'' </b> - Drive different cars around in different shaped circles.

==Online Play==
The <b>Playstation 2</b>, as we all know, was the second system capable of online play, as long as we don't count that [[shitty]] console [[Apple]] made a while back that [[nobody gives a shit]] about, or those things made for the [[SNES]] and [[Sega Genesis]]. Compared to the [[Xbox]], however, the <b>Playstation 2</b> wasn't the most used console for online play. However, there were quite a few titles that supported it. One of the most known titles was Tony Hawk's Underground, which wasn't too bad except for one glaring problem. Whenever you played it, you could almost fucking swear you were playing against [[South Korea|Koreans]], because when the game ended, you probably got like 5,000 points at best, while almost everyone else had [[Over 9000|10,000,000,000]]. The weird part was that those [[South Korea|Koreans]] weren't at their computers playing [[Starcraft]] instead. Another well known game was [[Final Fantasy XI]], not because it was good (it seriously wasn't), but because [[weeaboos]] were willing to shell out [[at least 100]] dollars to buy it. Why? Because the game required a <b>Playstation 2</b> hard drive, and if that wasn't bad enough, it required a subscription. So if you thought [[WoW]] players were the ones who set the benchmark for how dedicated an [[MMORPG]] player can be, you're probably wrong. One game that slightly justified upgrading to a slim PS2 or buying a network adapter to connect to the [[Ted Stevens|tubes]] was Metal Gear Solid 3:Subsistence, until [[gook|the incompetent suits at Konami]] shut down the servers after one measly year in preparation for the [[fail|spectacular MGS4 online gameplay]].

==Fanbase==
[[Image:Playstation2_girl.jpg|thumb|What [[fanboys]] wanted you to think a Playstation 2 was like]]
Back in the day, the <b>Playstation 2</b>'s fanbase was somewhat similar to what it is today: [[elitist]] [[Microsoft]] hating gamers. The only difference is that back then, they were real gamers and made valid arguments. The Sony [[fanboys]] of today are kids whose parents didn't want to spend a lot of money on the Wii or casualfags who couldn't afford a Wii. They yammer on and on about "HD quality graphics", because you know, graphics make 100% of a game, [[amirite]]? Back then, however, Sony [[fanboys]] went on about how the <b>Playstation 2</b> had a better variety of games, which was actually a solid argument. Of course this didn't stop them stroking their inviso-penis about all the other [[bullshit]] ways the <b>Playstation 2</b> was the best. When the [[Playstation 3]] was released, however, the <b>Playstation 2</b> fanbase split into two pieces. The old Sony [[fanboys]] got a PS3 right after it came out, not minding [[Over 9000|the price]] and played PS2 games on the early 60gb models and the casuals leveled up to the level of [[Dumbass]] and got a [[360]] realizing they would have to pay $600 for a system with barely any good games at the time, meaning the only people who play PS2 these days are those who can't afford a PS3 or those who can't afford a [[Nintendo Wii|Wii]]. This only left some of the biggest [[assholes]] and stubborn [[fanboys]] left, as evidenced by [[Sony Defense Force]].

==Linux? On MY PS2!?==
[[Image:Ps2_linux_cover.jpg|thumb|[[sarcasm|What a creative cover!]]]]
Sadly, it's more likely than you think. Before they made [[PS3]]s support [[Linux]], they had also released their OWN version of it for their <b>Playstation 2</b> system back in [[2002]]. The purpose of the package was for amateur programming for an operating system that [[Shit Nobody Cares About|nobody cares about]], when people would obviously have been better off doing amateur programming for [[Microsoft]] [[Windows]]. The only way this pointless software kit redeems itself is that it can be used to develop games for a modded <b>Playstation 2</b> system.

==The Slimline==
It seems that Sony loves to make miniaturized versions of practically every console they make. It always works, too, as consumers will always go bonkers when a company releases anything that's smaller than the previous product. This is because the only thing people want bigger are TVs and [[penises]]. In this case, they made a slimmer version of the <b>Playstation 2</b> and called it the PS2 [[anorexic|Slim]] and released it in 2004. This new <b>Playstation 2</b> was so compact that you couldn't insert a hard drive. [[Weeaboos]] and [[open source]] [[basement dwellers]] then proceeded to whine that they couldn't play [[Final Fantasy XI]] or install [[Linux]] onto this <b>Playstation 2</b>. Everyone else however (99.9% of the human population) didn't give a shit about this at all because [[Final Fantasy XI]] was being ported to the [[360]] and [[Linux]] [[lie|worked better]] on a [[PC]] anyways.
