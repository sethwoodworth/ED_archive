Cult of the Dead Cow
[[Image:0wned.gif|thumb|right|One of the most ingenious logos '''EVAR'''!]]

[http://www.cultdeadcow.com/ The Cult of the Dead Cow] (cDc) is a group of [[h4X0r]]s who founded a [[BBS]] e-zine in the 80s. They also founded [[teh]] h4X0r [[convention|con]]. But their biggest claim to fame is their creation of [[Back Orifice]] (though some claim they stole it from another Hacking group during joint operations), which has given [[Bill Gates]] nightmares for years. But, while all this stuff is cool and all, what really makes them worthy of your attention is their [[lulz]]-inducing history.

==cDc vs. Scientology==
{{SecurityFaggotry}}

[[At least 100 years ago|Once upon a time]] the Scientologists attempted to remove [[alt.religion.scientology]] from [[Usenet]]. Their [[lawyer]], Helena Kobrin, served a copyright infringement claim in the form of a "remove group" message.

This infuriated the cDc, who have been constant enemies of those seeking to impose censorship on the [[internet]]. The majority of cDc releases concern either encryption allowing anonymity or fighting against censorship. While [[nothing]] became of the [[lolsuit|injunction]] the cDc &ndash; functioning much as [[Anonymous]] would later &ndash; declared war on the Scifags. Below is the "declaration of war":

From: Swamp Ratte

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT: sratte@cascade.net

A statement from CULT OF THE DEAD COW/cDc communications:

It is our belief that L. Ron "Old Mother" Hubbard is to be held
accountable 
for the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women, and children in the 
"Killing Fields" of Phnum Penh, as we suspect that Pol Pot was a 
Scientologist!

We believe that El Ron Hubbard is actually none other than Heinrich Himmler
of the SS, who fled to Argentina and is now responsible for the stealing
of babies from hospitals and raising them as "super-soldiers" for the purpose
of overthrowing the U.S. Fed. Govt. in a bloody revolution. We fear plans
for a "Fourth Reich" to be established on our home soil under the vise-like
grip of oppression known as Scientology!

In order to preserve our way of life and keep the torch of freedom lit
for future generations, we feel it is our duty as responsible world citizens
to declare WAR on the so-called "CHURCH" OF SCIENTOLOGY.

As future developments occur, we will broadcast them to the free world
as soon as possible. Thank you for your time.

Following the declaration, the [[alt.religion.scientology]] board experienced a huge jump in traffic as curious individuals flocked to the [[sauce|source]] of the mayhem. The request to close the group was roundly ignored, and the dissemination of information from the [[alt.religion.scientology]] boards was viewed as a [[Fail|major defeat]] for Scientologists.

Almost thirteen years later the Scientologists found themselves in a [[PROJECT CHANOLOGY|similar situation]] after a copyright claim was filed against [[YouTube]] and later [[Gawker Media]] regarding the distribution of a [[Tom Cruise]] propaganda video. Around the same time, the cDc announced a powerful new tool named "Goolag" that uses the copious amounts of information collected by [[Google]] to find exploitable parts of websites. [[Coincidence]]? [[Conspiracy]]? [[Epic]] [[lulz]]? Only time will tell.


== The Ninja Strike Force ==
Around June 2005 The CDC realized everyone forgot about them so they made a forum so preteen script kiddies can suck their dick again. The so-called The Ninja Strike Force or the NSF as it would later be called was formed to people can once again know the love of the cow. The forum started off as a pretty decent place as far as forums go. It was largely self-moderated and the community got along pretty well. In 2006 that would all change when /b/-tards found out about it and started to flood the forum with gore and general faggotry. Once the shit storm subsided, the forum got DDOSed and it shut down for a few months. This happened a few times but no one has noticed.

== The Disappearance of Count Zero ==
Count Zero ran the Hasty Pastry which all of the CDCs websites ran on for free. One day he just up and left taking the severs with him and kicking the sites off of the network. Grandmaster Ratte' the glorious leader of the cdc posted that he didn't know what happened and will get back with everyone as soon as he knows more info. Well months passed and the site flickered on and off the net for a while until they found a stable host. When asked about what happened Grandmaster Ratt' remains silent.

== Hactivismo ==
Hactivismo is a site that rarely is updated that is supposed to be for Hacitvism. They normally post lulzy stories about human rights violations and internet censorship.

==Notable cDc Moments==
* 1987 &ndash; Tippy Turtle authors cDc's ingenious 18th issue, titled [http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/cDc-0018.html Bunny Lust].

* Nov 4, 1994 &ndash; cDc claims to have afflicted [[Ronald Reagan]] with Alzheimer's.

* Responds to [[Microsoft]]'s accusation of causing insecurity:

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">Back Orifice is a Rorschach for Microsoft credibility. Microsoft's own official response to us was issued as a marketing bulletin! Does anybody else besides cDc find it disturbing that the Marketing Department is running the show over there?</blockquote>

* During his [[genocide]] trial, Slobodan Milosevic questions Dr. Patrick Ball about his relationship with cDc &ndash; prompting conspiracy theories that [[h4X0r]]s hate Serbs.
