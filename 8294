During the 2010 NY Governor's race, [[a challenger appears|a challenger appeared]].  '''Jimmy McMillan''', the well-mustachioed [[black]] man from [[NYC]] is running on '''The Rent Is Too Damn High''' ticket, and is almost certain to be a spoiler in this hotly contested race.  He laid out his platform during the NY1 debate.

{{quote|I represent The Rent Is Too Damn High party.  People workin' 8 hours a and day 40 hours a week and some a third job.  Women can't afford to take care of their children, feed their children breakfast lunch and dinner.  My main job is provide a roof over your head, food on the table and money in your pocket.  This is politics as usual, playing the silly game, but its not gonna happen.  The Rent Is Too Damn High movement, the people I'm here to represent can't afford to pay their rent.  They're being laid off right now as i speak.  They can't eat breakfast lunch or dinner.  Listen!  Someone's stomach child stomach just growled, did you hear it?  Gotta listen like me.  Let's talk about the issue!  People can't afford to pay the rent are starving.  Rent is too damn high.

==The Name Is Too Damn Cool==

Originally the party's name was "The Rent is Too Damn High" however due to the character limit on the ballot, the 'Too' was changed to the numeric, '2'.  Read [http://www.rentistoodamnhigh.org/id95.html the Court Order] for yourself.

==Notable Quotes==
{{quote|As a karate expert, I will not talk about anyone up here, because our children cannot afford to live anywhere.  Nowhere, there's nowhere to go.  Once again, why?  You said it, 'cause the rent is too damn high.|Jimmy McMillan}}

{{quote|If you want to [[Prop 8|marry a shoe]], I'll marry you.|Jimmy McMillan|on gay marriage}}

==Resum√©==
Jimmy is a [[ninja]]. Even before he graduated from Private Investigator school in 1989 he was in [[Vietnam]] during the Vietnam War looking for [[John McRage]] who was being held by the [[User:Mungbean|VC]].

=The Soundtrack=
[[File:ritdhmusic.jpg|thumb|MS Paint your way to the top.]]

A visit to [[Geocities|the official website]] provides an excellent atmosphere of Jimmy's [[Lie|well-produced]] music. You can purchase CDs of his (political) party-themed hits, such as "Rent is Too Damn High" and local favorite "Rent is Too Damn High", as well as his club hit "Let's Party (Rent is Too Damn High)". His music and album art keep up with his [[shit|impressive]] web design integrity, featuring [[lazy|skillfully]] chosen layouts and [[Comic Sans|exotic fonts]]. Produced in Windows Sound Recorder and other [[Mario_Paint|professional software]], the constant clipping and hiss are SURE to sway [[You|you]] over to the Rent Is Too Damn High party. He's convinced enough of this to feature his tracks as auto-play on his website.

But srsly, he has ten or so 'Music CDs' for purchase on his site, and about half of them start with, what else, "Rent is Too Damn High"; on a bed of beats made with a Casio keyboard from 1992. It's tough to say for sure, but [[Some Argue|it's suggested]] that his motive is to display that his lack of musical talent and equipment stems from the fact that his rent is less than reasonable, and therefore the most logical way to discourage his musical diarrhea and [[ban|remove it from the internet]] is to [[Final Solution|lower rent city-wide]].

==Aftermath==
[[File:Rentistoodamnhighvote.jpg|thumb|Well, at least [[you]] voted for yourself.]]
Despite his strong internet presence, Jimmy McMillan and The Rent Is 2 Damn High party were unable to muster ''actual'' votes, falling far short of the 50,000 needed to earn an automatic slot in the next [[rape|election cycle]].
