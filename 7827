'''S'''hut '''T'''he '''F'''uck '''U'''p is a command used to inform an internet user that they need to be quiet, stop posting or stop talking on [[IRC]]. Also used as a way of expressing disbelief.&#134; Also used on a [[message board]] to express the fact that the person you are replying to is a [[fucking idiot]].&#134;&#134;

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_Of_Honor:_Frontline]] WIKIPEDIA JUST TOLD YOU TO SHUT THE FUCK UP MAN

&#134;Ex. ''"She said I was a bitch so I told her to STFU"''

&#134;&#134;Ex. '''Message Subject''': ''"Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't aware that"''
      '''Message Body''': ''"STFU."''

The correct pronunciation of STFU is "stoofoo" ([[VideoCompiler|see]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gLTfGDlEFU here]).

== Grammar ==
[[Grammar Nazi]]s will often tell you to watch your prepositions near the end of sentences.  They will happily suggest you use the abbreviation Stuf (Shut the up fuck) as a substitute - the polite response is to immediately tell them to '''STFU'''.

== STFU in spoken language ==

To prove how [[1337]] they are, [[fucktards]] will often choose [[IRL]] to say "Ess [[English|tea]] eff [[you]]" instead of just "shut the fuck up." They somehow believe that this is less offensive or not counted as swearing, which is handy because [[Christian|naughty words makes baby Jesus cry]]. Some retards also believe that saying STFU is quicker than shut the fuck up, which [[ignore|ignores]] the lulzy fact that they are both four syllables.  But they are still going to [[hell]] because most dumbasses who act like this are [[furry]]s.  Still others like to pronounce it like a real word, by saying, "Stuh-foo."  They are obviously a [[faggot]] and should promptly be told to STFU. But really they are just saying '[[dick|stuff]] [[your mom|you]]'.

== The big STFU ==
Eventually [[God]] will get sick of [[furry]]s, [[midget]]s, [[Unbirthing|unbirthed fucktards]], [[pedophile]]s, [[your mom]] and other [[sick fuck]]s. When this happens, the [[Apocalypse]] will happen, allowing God to finally make the [[fucktards|human race]] STFU. God will descend to [[Earth]] in the form of an [[80 year old Chinese man in panties]], give the finger to [[W]] and then explode, killing all but <s> [[Chuck Norris]].</s> [[Stephen Colbert]].

== Forms of STFU in nature ==
STFU is know to exist in three main forms: Fist, foot, and liquid.
How to administer STFU:
* [[Falcon Punch|FALCON PUNCH]]! for the fist variety.
* Cunt Punt for the foot variety.
* One cup administered orally for the liquid variety



== ... or STFU ==
Replacing the [[old]] "[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22or+bust%22 ...or bust]" [[catchphrase]], "... or STFU" is quickly gaining popularity.  Usage examples:
<br><br>
