If you could gather and concentrate all the [[AIDS|illnesses]] of the internet and embody them in one individual, you would have Nymphetamine. Nymphetamine was the resident camwhore of now-dead shitty gore site [[b0G]], spending up to 14 hours a day posting and surfing the internet for shock images with which to impress her friends. Her career was sadly cut short when it was revealed that "she" was actually a "he", and in her shame, Nymphetamine [[deleted fucking everything]].

After an obsessive amount of  butthurt and  internet sleuthing, a group of [[basement dwellers|dedicated trolls]] tracked down the real Nymphetamine. Nymphetamine, an eternal [[attention whore]], would lurk various gore forums in search of pictures to satisfy the [[sick fuck]]s of b0G and be loved. While she used different names on each site, these trolls [[Assburgers|noticed patterns in the images]] posted by certain members and were able to connect them to Nymphetamine. After many months of observation, Nymphetamine's true identity was revealed when he posted a link to a Hot or Not profile on one of his various personas.

On March 10, 2008, the [[transvestite]] filth that was Nymph deleted her b0g account. It appears that after a mass attack on [[b0G]], hitting nearly every page with a link to this article and revealing Nymph's true form, "she" was too ashamed to face her internet buddies and retired completely. Her deleting her account was the final nail in her coffin, and ironically she drove it in herself. If she had not deleted her account, then most of b0g's members would no doubt have considered this little vendetta against her to be nothing but a passing phase and moved on to the next shock image after seeing their former camwhore's ugly mug.
