When riding a bike, it's important to remember a few golden rules or you will end up dead and mocked over the [[interweb]]s. [[Oh noes]]!

== Drink and Drive ==

[[Beer]] makes you more alert when riding a bike. This is very valuable when riding at night; just light a fart on fire for instant illumination. Then maybe the cars will notice you and not run right over your [[aspie]] ass.

== Wear a helmet ==

The most important thing about bike safety is to wear a helmet, or else you will die a horrible painful death like [[Lilo]] did. Helmets save lives, unless you fall off and into the path of a truck while adjusting your helmet. [[Some argue]] this is what happened to [[Rob Levin]].

== Don't get distracted ==

Letting your mind wonder onto other things, such as what that [[16 year old girl]] looks like [[naked]], will get you killed. As [[Rob Levin]] proved, masturbating while riding a bike can lead to serious injury and death.

== Lock your bike ==

[[Black people]] are incapable of purchasing bikes, as they are [[IRL]] [[poor]]. For this reason it is important to always [[nigga stole my bike|lock your bike]], just not to a [[watermelon]] stand or [[KFC]] as this may lead to a swarm of [[zombie apocalypse]] proportions. Also, [[Rob Levin]] is dead.

== OL Opinions on Cyclists ==

**"I'm not saying I'd kill [[Rob Levin|cyclists]], I'm saying they should stay away from cars. You drive a bike on the road, with cars, don't bitch if you get squashed." --Dark Messiah
*[http://www.cyclingscotland.org/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=330 Scottish Cycling Forum]
**"[[Rob Levin|I]] am embarrassed at times to be called a cyclist because my car driving colleagues rant and [[rave]] about suicidal idiots riding bicycles. What is embarrassing is they are right - [[Rob Levin|most cyclists are idiots]]." --Chris
*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/have_your_say/soapbox_07.shtml BBC Devon -- The Soapbox]
**"Yes Kenny [[Rob Levin|some cyclists]] are [[idiot]]s, but no worse than the arrogant idiots you get behind the wheels of cars and vans. Car and van drivers are far more [[stupid]] and irrisponsible than any cyclist I ever have seen! Your attitude is typical of the dangourous arrigant attitude of the the car driver who thinks 'im in a car in a hurry, my right of way get out the way'. Kenny ,your attitude towards cyclists is incredibly arrogant, stupid, and I totally disagree with you!" --Toby
