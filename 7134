Ryan Bilodeau is the head of the [[fags|College Republicans]] at the [[college|University of Rhode Island]] where they meet every Monday of every month for the monthly circle jerks. While studying business and political science at URI Ryan also was the campaign manager for two failed Republican elections in the state of Rhode Island. He lost both of the elections due to his obvious homosexuality which republicans naturally [[H8|hate]]. IRL Ryan is a self-hating homosexual.

Even his own Republican party has cast him away because of his absolute failure. The Republican Party wants nothing to do with Ryan as he cost them two valuable elections. He is subsequently thinking of practicing the limp-wristed life style.

His political career is OVER because he doesn't know how to use the Internet.

==Work==

Student at the University of Rhode Island

==Facebook faggotry==

[[Image:RBilofacebook.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Ryan's homosexual twist on the MILF hunter series. He later had sex with these men.]]

Ryan also tried to further his political career by posting an image of him making a limp-wristed gesture at a [[faggot]] on his Facebook profile. When this image was sent to every leader at his University by a member of his own Young Republicans group in an effort to discredit him, it created much lulz that it even ended up in the student newspapers. [[baw|Ryan took the image down]], but we have it archived here. lol ^-^

Ryan desperately cried to the URI Snugglenet police and claimed his password was hacked and the image was edited. However, Ryan's knowledge of computers is proportional to how in touch he is with his nation's political views. Ryan went up the Internet police ladder all the way to Yahoo! to get the DNS number of the person who sent the email. However Yahoo! had better things to do than to worry about Ryan's [[drama]].

==Registration as a sex offender==
As of May 2007 Ryan was busted by Perverted Justice trying to solicit sex with a 12 year old boy. Ryan was forced to register as a sex offender in the state of Rhode Island but used his republican connections to avoid it being publicly known.

==Ryan's Dad==
Is dead. He was a janitor at his high school Mount St. Charles. Ryan was bullied not only over his enormous weight, but also over his dad being a janitor at the high school he went to. Ryan's dad died a horrible homosexual death which Ryan tried to cover up. Ryan's dad had drugs found in his system and was a known heroin addict. Ryan inherited his homosexuality from his father as it is passed on from the father's side. The only reason Ryan's dad had a son was because he sold his AIDS-ridden sperm for drug money.

==The Haxx==
Ryan just can't let things go. For example: after complaining to Encyclopedia Dramatica about his article and subsequently realizing that ED is serious business, Ryan decided to get all chummy with one of the dramacrats involved, and perhaps use her to haxx0r his ex-girlfriend's computer.

[02:01] flowmobile: alright I have an awesome story for you
[02:01] Cancer Chips: shoot

the problem is a denial of reality
[02:03] Cancer Chips: right
[02:04] flowmobile: not only did she fabricate stories like that to me, but then she made me the bad 
                    guy when I found out that she was lying, a mere month in, so that she wouldn't 
                    have to face the issues she has
[02:04] flowmobile: so to me that infuriates me
[02:04] flowmobile: in that she now "talks shit" to all of our mutual friends

                    told them all really fucked up lies about me
[02:05] Cancer Chips: im an inspiration, no?
[02:05] flowmobile: oh yes
[02:05] flowmobile: now I already ratted her out to her parents, but that wasnt enough
[02:05] flowmobile: I see her roomate yesterday in the student union, so i told her everything
[02:06] flowmobile: so her roomate is pissed at her for me
[02:06] Cancer Chips: that's a good start
[02:06] flowmobile: her roomate is the number one person i could have lobbied
[02:06] flowmobile: she is going to help me in WHATEVER i want to do

[02:12] flowmobile: which i dont know how to do
[02:12] flowmobile: what about if someone direct connected to her over AIM
[02:12] flowmobile: sent her the file that way

[02:13] flowmobile: her roomate can though
[02:13] flowmobile: but
[02:13] flowmobile: she has a screen saver password
[02:13] flowmobile: its an apple
[02:13] Cancer Chips: she's not going to run something a total stranger sends her
[02:13] Cancer Chips: what is her aim?
[02:14] flowmobile: xrhodyxtenx
[02:14] flowmobile: is her s/n

<!-- a few minutes of bullshitting about what kind of hax can be pulled off -->

[02:17] flowmobile: okay so how do we get it on there? direct connect through aim?
[02:17] flowmobile: the second she shuts her cover, screen saver goes on
[02:17] flowmobile: and roomate cant put it on
[02:17] flowmobile: due to password
[02:17] Cancer Chips: i'll figure something out... it also depends on whether she has an intelmac or 
                      not, cause it's written in asm for ppc
[02:17] flowmobile: right ok
[02:18] flowmobile: and if not we do the good-old fashioned baseball bat smashing
[02:18] flowmobile: that would be more enjoyable
[02:19] Cancer Chips: yea, but baseball bat smashing is vandalism
[02:19] flowmobile: right.  the great thing is everything you do seems to be legal
[02:19] Cancer Chips: my trick leaves nothing. it runs, does its job, and kils itself
[02:19] flowmobile: good
[02:19] Cancer Chips: not really
[02:19] flowmobile: k ha
[02:19] Cancer Chips: it's just untraceable
[02:19] flowmobile: right
[02:19] flowmobile: fuck her

[02:20] Cancer Chips: i love ruin
[02:20] flowmobile: pay some black guys to rape her

==Personal Life==
Ryan loves chasers as opposed to plumpers. You see, Ryan had a weight problem growing up. On his off time he hangs out with his brother and partner Billy Bilodeau.

[[Image:Rbilocock.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Ryan pictured here with his brother Billy.]]

His ex-girlfriend (the one he tried to have haxxed) has a restraining order on him, but he denies it:

<pre>
[02:45] flowmobile: the other day i was talking to this girl 
                    and she walked by and her face turned 
                    red and she put her head down.  she told 
                    her roomate that she had supposedly 
                    gotten a restraining order against me so 
                    when she saw me that day she came up to 
                    me and was like the r/o doesn't allow 
                    us to be this close 
[02:45] flowmobile: so thats kind of a microcosm of what I 
                    dealt with
[02:48] Cancer Chips: rough
[02:49] flowmobile: i know
[02:49] flowmobile: we've all made mistakes and lied, like i did the other day
[02:49] flowmobile: but this is fabricating stories
[02:50] flowmobile: alright well u got better shit to do than talk about this crazy gir
[02:50] flowmobile: girl
</pre>

==Personal Quotes==

''Ryan tries to live by the motto "Strength and Honor", and names his father as his personal hero, because "he gave everything he could for his family."''

This is obviously true if "Strength and Honor" means failing miserably in life. His father is obviously his hero; where do you think Ryan learned his homosexuality?

''In ten years, Ryan hopes to be “wherever God calls me to be,”''

Wake up Ryan, Jesus died a long time ago. If he was so smart, how come <s>he died?</s> DISREGARD THAT
