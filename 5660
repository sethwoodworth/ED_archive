Nationstates
[[Image:AllSeeingEye.JPG|thumb|Jennifer Government has a [[cult]] following]]
[[Image:NSnerds.jpg|thumb|NS Players dressed for battle]]
'''NationStates''' is a lame text-based online game in which [[over 9000]] wanna-be dictators (and, frequently, would-be [[gay|dick tasters]]) make their own little [[imaginary|pretend]] countries and discuss [[politics]]. Arguments, pseudo-wars, and mindless namecalling follows. Eventually players will be banned and [[emo|cry]] about it on other websites, even if [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody gives a shit]]. <s>At least they're not [[furries]].</s> Not anymore, lol (c.f. Hataria, Free Furry Islands, Far Echo Islands, Kitsuneville, Cazelia, Fox Rite, TFU and Lyncanthropia). They've even admitted to being [[pedophile|kid diddlers]], so pretty much anything goes[http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=28963&start=25].

NationStates was actually created to [[extreme advertising|advertise]] a book by [[unfunny]] [[Aussie]] Ma[r]x Barry (who is bald to assist in [[unbirthing]])  called ''Jennifer Government'', but [[nobody]] cares about that, mainly because it [[crap|fucking sucks]]. Anyway, why read a book when you could be imaginary-[[raping]] imaginary peasants in your imagination?

It's run by [[Commie]]s (confirmed by players) and at least one furfag (obvious). Anyone expressing a [[republican|right-wing political bias]] is either banned or sent to work in Siberian uranium mines (confirmed). They also ban [[pirate]]s, people pretending to be pirates, [[funny|anybody who makes a joke]], anybody who posts a [[smiley]], and [[1984|anybody who the moderators randomly decide should die]]. This causes much [[butthurt|crying]] from the [[losers]] that use the site. However, they seem to tolerate fascists, Nazis, [[pedo bear|child molesters]], [[pedophiles]], and retards very well. It is advised to not argue with these people as [[Godwin's law]] usually applies itself around post three. Alternatively, if it doesn't, the conversation devolves into incoherent babble which will then make your throat want to [[an hero|strangle itself]]. Sometimes this involves cheesecake, which is [[delicious cake|delicious]], but most often it does not.


== Definitions ==
[[Image:The_real_book.jpg|thumb|Based on Nationstates. The horror!]]
*'''Region''' - where nations live, [[dumbass]].
*'''WFE''' - [[acronym|short for]] World Factbook Entry. At the top of the page. [[Nobody|Nobody uses this, though]].
*'''RMB''' - [[acronym|acronym that nobody uses for]] Regional Message Board. The message box at the bottom of all the regions. You can post your stupid shit on here to annoy people.
*'''Founder''' - The nation that first made the region. He/she can ban, eject, erase the RMB, or change the WFE.
*'''Delegate''' - If the region is founderless or not, <strike>the delegate has the most power in the region.</strike> except for [[password]] protected regions and regions that have delegate powers disabled, moron. He/she takes the duties of the founder if there's no founder.
*'''[[asshole|Raiding]]''' - [[Raping Little Suzy|Your goal]]. Read on below.
*'''Defenders''' - [[moralfag|Your enemy]]. [[boring|Fun to troll]], but get very [[butthurt]] over raiders. [[unwarranted self-importance|Believe they are good people.]]
*'''Banject''' - a combination of banning and ejecting from a region. [[gay|Fun]].
*'''[[United Nations|World Assembly]]''' - created by Max after Gatesville became butthurt over the United Nations. Join the WA to gain WA status. Needed for [[troll|raiding]].
*'''Endorsing''' [[popular|How one gets to become a delegate]]. The nation with the [[whore|most endorsements]] in the region [[fail|wins]] that region.
*'''DOS''' - Short for [[banhammer|Deleted on sight]]. What will, with [[child porn|persistence]], [[im pressin charges|happen to you eventually]].

== Where to go ==
On the front page, you will see many little links that will send you to various [[shit]] pertinent to the game. Direct yourself over to the "create a nation" section and create a nation that has a name full of lulz (Note to trolls like yourself: '''Things that are Banned from NS''' include, but are not limited to: [[Goatse]] and other [[porn]], [[God Hates Fags]], [[swastika|Swastikas]] (in nation flags), [[4chan]], and [[swearing|thread titles that aren't bland]]), [[lulz|fun]] and [[Encyclopædia Dramatica|us]]. Once your nation is created, you'll end up in one of the pacific regions. In these regions (The Pacific, The East Pacific, The North Pacific, you get the picture), you will find a blend of wide-eyed newfags and holier-than-thou oldfags who, if provoked, will provide you with hours of [[lie|enjoyable, fun loving lectures]] on the glorious history and development of the game, completely scripted to give them some sort of high-standing in the events that be (apparently everyone there is an attention whore).

If a feeder isn't your idea of a fun time, move to another region by clicking "world", going to the bottom of the page, and typing in a region. But, of course, a crash-course in regions is completely necessary! Below is a list of some regions and a brief description to go along with it, as well as the troll rating (moar stars means moar fun):

[[Image:Fox_rite.jpg|thumb|Fox Rite's flag. Used by many a troll]]
*Fox Rite - A once powerful raiding region now reduced to reminiscing. Think [[Furluminati]]. Run by an [[Todd McCloud|EDiot]]. Troll Rating: ***
*The Last Kingdom - A large region run by an attempted [[an hero]]. Troll Rating: ****
*10000 Islands - with only about 300 members, the landscape is pretty barren, [[amirite]]? Founder of [[Titty|TITO]], a butthurt defendfag group. Love inactivity, hate activity. Fun times to be had here. Troll Rating: ****
*Taijitu - Old region, lots of members, nothing happens here. Troll Rating: **
*Gatesville - A one thousand nation region (with about half of that being puppet nations). Run by a forty year old redneck still playing the game. All the [[lolwut|High Council]] are extremely butthurt over the following: image, power, pride, and being able to use that as a justification to all arguments. Among lolcows are wannabe Schlemeils (known Jew, closet [[Commie|lolberal]] amirite); also note wanna/b/ Kostemetsia, fucktard [[fail|Australian]] and known [[Commie]] with an aptitude for [[Tubgirl|shit]] "writing". Troll Rating: *****
*Nicaragua - Run entirely by [[fat]], [[feminazi]], [[atheist]], [[liberal]], [[Mexico|hispanic]] cows with [[nazi]] tenancies. No joke. An easy first trolling job, and always fun to watch dig themselves into [[goatse|holes]]. Troll Rating: *****
*Gholgoth - RP region full of people who take themselves waaay too seriously. "Disrespecting" them will lead to lulzy rage. Troll Rating: ****
*Gay - The region is completely [[gay]]. That is all. Troll Rating: ****
*Catlandatopia - Once arguably the most powerful region in the game. Now in reminisce-mode. Troll Rating: **
*4chan - Yeah, even 4chan has a region. Troll Rating: WOT YOU PLAN TO TROLL 4CHAN?
*Illuminati - A bunch of wanna-be CIA ops. Not very active, though. Troll Rating: **
*First Reich of Der Fuhrer - Despite the name, not [[bullshit|nazis]]. Everyone in the region is a [[alcolol|drunkard]], and one is an [[User:Sars|EDiot]]. Unfortunately linked to defenders, and often protected. Troll rating: *
*NAZI_EUROPE - Contrary to what they want you to know, many nazis are Nationstates players. Fun to talk to. Troll Rating: ***


There are, of course, more regions than this. And in reality one can only troll up to the return of the founder or delegate. Once the founder or delegate logs in, party could be over, as they're allowed to clear the RMB and banject any newfag. However, if one wishes to troll further, many regions put their websites in the WFE as well as their forums. Troll on, brave soldier.


=== The crappy RP Forums ===
Two forums, "International Incidents," and the [[Ebaumsworld|creatively]] named "NationStates" forum, are devoted to roleplay. The writing on the former consists mostly of [[basement-dweller|basement-dwellers]] waving their [http://forums.jolt.co.uk/showthread.php?t=395339/ kilometer long, multi-turreted, rail-gun-armed, armored steel dicks] (compensation for their [[IRL|RL]] [[:Image:Retractedmicrowang.jpg|inadequacies]]) at each other. Posts that involve characters that are not said [http://forums.jolt.co.uk/showthread.php?t=478951/ metal phallic substitutes] are pure [[shit]], usually consisting of [[stupid|two barely coherent sentences or less]]. Most of the time, attempts at war RP's devolve into [[crybaby|whiny]] arguments about "god-modding" involving lots of pseudo-physics and [[flaming]]. Sometimes one of the fags involved is amusingly hit with the [[banhammer]] for being a [[retard|tard]], which the [[butthurt|victim]] will sometimes come back under a different name and [[crybaby|complain]] about. 

The latter forum ("NationStates") claims to be more "character-based" and "story-based." This really just means that it consists of long posts which are merely [[common knowledge|thinly veiled]] softcore written [[masturbation|smut]], some of which is perilously close to [[furry|furfagdom]], and the rest of which is either [[LOTR]] ripoffs (woooo! [[starcraft|elves in space!]]), or Underworld ripoffs (mostly written by Assington, The Golden Simatar and other snobs) or both (written by Tarlachia, Callisdrun, a girly-man [[sick fuck|pervert]] who likes [[menstruation|menstrual blood]] and should be [[list of sex moves|skull fucked]]).

These RPing [[lemonparty|circle jerks]] have spawned several smaller spin-off forums consisting of members who were too [[emo]] for nationstates and sad because of their insignificance. The best of these is [http://sovereignkingdoms.com/index.php?act=idx/ Sovereign Kingdoms], due to the fact that the guy who runs it (as well as making over 90% of the site's posts) is a [[Christian]] [[fundamentalist]] who  isn't afraid to share his opinions on [[niggers]], [[jews]] and [[illuminati|government]]. Other spin-offs include [http://dailyescape.proboards41.com/index.cgi/ Daily Escape], [[Canada|Global Progress]], [http://nationsonline.planegate.com/index.php/ Nations Online] and [http://grandwebterminal.com/game/index.php/ World at Play]. These all suck even more than NationStates, however, due to the fact that their members are [[13-year-old boy|teenage fucktards]] who can't go a week without [[Drama War|fucking up their own site for entertainment because their posts suck so much]]. The faggotry of these sites is so immense that it has even infected ED; certain butthurt [[faggots|RPers]] have used this very page to [[BAWWWWW]] about the gay melodrama on these forums in TL;DR semi-coherent edits, thus exacerbating the [[Exhibit_B|GRIDS]] that is killing ED.

===Notable Roleplayers:===

*[[Hataria]] (now Steppe Empire, a.k.a. The Hyperborian Khanate):  As previously mentioned, he's one of the biggest furfags on NS.  He got banned by the mods after proving how fucking stupid he was by threatening to sue them if they didn't side with him.  He's now known as The Steppe Empire due to his actions, and is now fucking up II with bullshit-random invasions of other nations right before being continually pwnt. Is speculated to have [[Assburgers]].

*The Fedral Union (a.k.a. The United Terran Alliance): Pisses people off. He'll resort to name calling when something doesn't go his way, when he's not pissing people off by being shit. He also comes up with sucktastic story plots, most of which are luckily shot down by Naggeroth (his gay lover) on MSN before it reaches the light of day. He also RPs giant dick starships to make up for his lack of a penis in the first place. Also smokes pot. Hates Hataria like asshole cancer. Is also an IRL faggot.

*Allanea: Libertarian capitalist rednecks in space with plasma rifles. Has [[Awesome|a demigod as his leader]], and hates slavers. Often loses IC debates with post-scarcity communists. Is a total ass.

*New Dornalia:  RP's some fucking Communistic future version of earth after the Fallout 3 universe.  Often focuses on Catgirls and has butt sex with Huntaer because they're rumored to be RL friends.

*CoreWorlds: A dumb ass who roleplays a mixture of Naruto Faggots (and jerks off to them) and Star Wars.  He follows "Rool of Cule," and also gets raped by it proving that his so-called "skills" suck. The fucktard also likes to Role Play kids getting beaten up, probably because he is a pedophile.  He is of the opinion that the [[Lie|good guys should win and bad guys lose]].  [[Lulz|Recently, he's discovered that's not the case and has on multiple occasions gotten raped up the ass by sandpaper condoms because of it.]]    The grass ain't green on either side kiddo.

*Chronosia: [[Unoriginal|Originally a Chaos RPer]] and a god to the rest of the NS losers.  Now lies in absence because he kept sucking Khorne's cock for too long.

*Auman:  A member of some fucking alliance who considers it to be the most important thing in the world because he (and the rest of them) are a bunch of fucking arrogant losers/nerds.  Also is a faggot for Canada and would gladly fuck a random street corner because he loves it so much.

*Bryn Shander: Is totally fucking wrong about everything. Also has an [[Unwarranted_Self-Importance|unwarranted sense of self-importance]] because of his shitty map, which is [[AIDS|horrible]] and worse in every way that one could imagine by the ESUS map, [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|which allows you to place individual planets accurately.]] [[Pedophile|Also, he likes little girls.]] Further proving just how stupid and wrong he really is, he got himself banned from NS by insulting moderators on IRC chat (also proving that mods are indeed bias butt pirates). Seriously, you really expect to call a NYPD officer a "Pig" or "Fascist" and not get raped?

*The Sick Fucks: There are two notable sick fucks on the RP forums.  Orthodox Gnosticism and Huntaer come to mind, one who RP's a shitty BSG alternate reality, the other who steals shit from other existing sci-fi shows and movies because he can't come up with his own original stuff.  They come up with incest scenes and other rape related issues because they were raped as kids and want to share their experiences with the rest of the public.  They probably butt fucked each other too.

*The Parthians: A nation of psuedo Arab/[[Nazi]] who has no qualms murdering, raping and overall fucking shit up and profiting like [[Jews]]. An invasion by his nation is pretty much a closed casket for anyone who gets attacked. Countless nations raped under his banner

*EWT: Full name "Evil Woody Thoughts," he certainly lacks what his title implies. He attempts to be a "tough macho" person, but in reality is actually a scrawny little white faggot who sucks dick at life. The lowest form of life, he is worse than a push over, he's a MSN pushover. Whenever someone actually shoves him back, he starts whining and bitching about him not getting his way, much more so than TFU ever does thusly, proving that he actually lacks a dick. He deleted his nation in a rage attempt at gaining sympathy from people he associated with, but no one ended up giving a fuck. Apparently, he is back as Clan Makaryk, bitching about some fucking illusion he has about "former glory," insisting that he is still bigger and better than everyone else and continues to suck his own pussy which has recently replaced the imaginary dick he had.  If you want a good troll for lulz, this guy is highly recommended to fuck around with.

*Thrashia: Another faggy Star Wars based Nation, he currently rules the wannabe- Galactic Empire alliance. His favorite character is a blue, red eyed smurff named "Grand Admiral Thrawn" and continuously thinks about sucking his dick and having his ass being fucked by the Admiral.  He thinks his smurff fag is the best thing since General Grant, though he can only hope that he can one day suck Admiral Helena Cain's tiny-ass lesbian tits.

* Unified Sith: Aka "Sithy," is one of the oldest Star Wars fags on NS.  He continuously likes to suck George Lucas's cock and pussy (yes, lucas has both) by praising his name. He's also an admitted priest, thusly automatically making him a child molester and pedophile.

* Skaugra: Known for his Mechwarrior faggotry, he's also an acknowledge sailor making him a guy who loves to drink semen. He's also of the opinion that 500 gigaton nukes are awesome compared to giant lazers of d000mz.  In reality though, people who argue for either size are obviously making up for the dick that they lack.

*Balrogga: Likes to RP a race of sucktastickness known as "kythons" who are nigh but invincible in most ways. This obviously indicates he simply doesn't have a big enough dick to fuck with everyone else on the forums and has to make up for it by making up gayness. He's also one of the oldest players on NS, indicating a possible pedophile.

*Derscon: Probably one of the gayest players on NS. He relies on characters that are literally "Gods," making him all but invincible. Clearly this indicates he's making up for lack of skill, and the size of his dick. He also has a fetish for blood orgies indicated by the constant death tournament stories he starts up.

*Godular: AKA: Godmodular by many who have placed him on "ignore."  The guy is overly obsessed with Lovecraft, going so far as he wishes he could suck the fucktard's decomposing cock, indicating necrophilia urges.  He loves to fap to his own apparent awesomeness, which no one else bothers to acknowledge.  Almost on the same scale as the "Sick Fucks," however he doesn't focus on rape and incest as much as he focuses on fucking dead bodies and blood orgies.

*The Wick (AKA: The Farstars Republic): A general all around douchebag who likes to fuck everybody else's ideas, making him one of the bigger dicks on NS.  He also likes to fap to his own characters having sex, whom he and Orthodox Gnosticism wrote out on a few occasions.  Notably, he thinks he's the best simply because he's a retired marine.  Sadly, he fails to realize this only makes him a baby eater.

*C'tan: Originally a Necron player of sorts, he has since long fallen from the path of Warhammergayness and into general all around faggotry. A mere shadow of the C'tan gods themselves, he clearly should stop pretending to be the necrons and just simply accept the fact that he lives in his parents basement, fapping to furries.

=== The even worse non-RP Forums ===
[[Image:Tacitus.jpg|thumb|left|NSGers' opinion of themselves]]
[[Image:Fo0bar-sans-hair.jpg|thumb|NSGers in reality]]
Other forums include "Gameplay," where idiots come to ask how to change their [[menstrual painting|flag]], their region, their motto, or any of a variety of stupid questions that their down syndrome asses can't figure out themselves, "United Nations," where nsfags go to [[unwarranted self importance|take themselves too seriously]] as if their proposals actually mattered and weren't just hours of wasted time, "Moderation," where people go to whine about getting flamed or banned, an activity that causes much laughing among the [[moderator|mods]], and "General." 

This last is filled with pseudo-[[intellectual]]s, [[commie]]s, wine-sipping [[socialist]]as, [[creationist]]s, [[evolution]]ists who hate the creationists, volvo-driving [[liberals]], bush-fellating [[conservatives]], [[anarchists]], [[libertarians]] (most of which claim they have [[Asperger's Syndrome]]), [[niggers]], [[camwhores]], [[objectivists]], [[homosexuality|fags]], morons who hold every kind of dumbass political ideology ever invented, old farts and all other manner of annoying people who should not be on the internet. Apparently half the forum has some form of [[autism]] or [[Asexual|other mental disorder]]. [[Memes]] from [[4chan]] often appear in watered down form on NSG years later. The [[Adolf Hitler|moderators]] basically keep anything from getting too fun, chiefly by [[banhammer|banning]] anyone who [[pwns]] another poster too massively. The entire forum suffers from [[unwarranted self importance]] and consists almost entirely of [[attention whores]]. It gets boring after about a day because in the [[history]] of the forum there has never been an original thread (except for the one Der Fuhrer Dyszel titled "If I had a [[Penis]]," which the mods ruined by changing the title to "If I was a man," which demonstrated how the mods are anti-fun, as the thread was not about DFD waking up as a man, but as a [[shemale|dick-girl]], and the one created by this [[pervert]] from [[Canada]] aptly nicknamed "Sin," where all the NStards reveal how [[sick fuck|kinky]] they are; this thread was closed by the mods because the mods felt like it) since the [[at least 100 years ago|creation of the site]]. Other shining examples of intellectual stimulating debate include [http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=28867|A nuclear bomb will explode, torture terrorist's daughter?] and [[Pedophiles]] [http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=28963&start=25| get a bad rap], both of which include much lulz, b&hammer usage and subsequent moderator cocksucking out of mortal fear.

The rest of NS hates NSG as much as encyclopaedia dramatica does. Probably even more.

====Notable NSG members====
* [[Lunatic Goofballs]] - Almost confirmed homosexual pedophile by own admission thanks to much investigative research and mostly lulz; it is a NSG tradition that people praise him and his massive cock, and gently stroke it, once he uses his b&hammer, for they fear he will use it on them.
* Marathon - OlDsKoOl troll from cira 2003. Used to troll the liberals and libertarians by calling them pussies for not defending America from Iraq.
* The Red Arrow - High school libfag who constantly copypasta'd articles from informationclearinghouse.info, infowars.com, and other batshit insane websites.

[[Image:Generalmotivatorkx5.jpg|thumb|NSG is known for its posters' willingness to rationally consider outside opinions ]]

== [[rape|How to]] [[Troll]]==
[[Image:56-nerds-poster.jpg|thumb|All apply.]]If you want to make a [[ass|nuisance]] of yourself, just follow these simple step-by-step instructions.


*[[scat|Create a nation]].
*Get [[liberalism|WA]] status.
*Get [[13 year old boys|your friends]] to join with you and get WA status.
*[[prostitution|Go to a region and become the WA Delegate after endo-whoring]].
*With your power as [[faggot|UN Delegate]], eject and ban everyone from the region simultaneously. 
*Refound the region late at night. The Power is yours!

If you do this late at night, it will be at [[at least 100|least a day before]] anyone notices. Even if someone notices, no one will actually do anything. Seriously. [[Nothing]].

Other known troll-triggers include praising / condemning a former nation called Francos Spain, claiming to be a member of DEN, Fox Rite, or Gatesville (fly said regions' respective flags [[ftw]]), getting into completely irrelevant arguments with older players (nations with populations bigger than 3 billion), and randomly leading "movements" across larger regions. 		

Alternatively, post a thread on [[/b/|General]] saying you support ''[[random|anything]]''. It doesn't matter what—but generally, conservative bias achieves moar [[lulz]]. Edit: Be sure to stick around and pretend to argue for whatever position your thread is supporting/condemning/whatever. This way it will take [[retards|them]] longer to realize that you are a [[troll]]. If possible, start a huge new argument over some [[shit nobody cares about|technicality]] in someone's post. This will have them going for hours and will make your trolling most lulzy. However, no troll is ever as good as Jesussaves. 

[[also, cocks|Alternatively alternatively]], post something mean about the [[homosexuality|faggot]] known as "Fass" (also known as Fassigen and Fassitude). This will cause an [[outrage|uproar]] on the forum, with about half leaping to this [[unwarranted self importance|forum celebrity]]'s defense and the other half agreeing with whatever terrible things you are saying about him. Can be highly entertaining if you're plagued by boredom. [[Moar]] difficult, <s>but also great fun, is trolling the fuck out of Andaras.</s> Andaras was too easy to troll so he got banned.  Instead, try trostia, Heikoku, or cat-tribe, especially if you can get them to have a pussy fight with each other.

Massive lulz can also be derived from baiting well-established players. This can be done by calling them [[Communism|Tyrants]] or [[Furries|Barbarians]] for some time until they finally snap in an ejaculatory rage. Example: (tl;dr: [[RAGE]])



''I want you, yes YOU, the person reading this, to make sure and pay attention to what I'm about to say and not just skim it over.

''I'm not going to get in the middle of all the childish bickering taking place, because frankly I don't care. I don't care about who's right, who's wrong, who started it, etc. I'm also not going to explain the situation at hand, because if you don't know already then this is of no concern to you. What this all boils down to is this: roleplay.''

''Roleplay on II has evolved heavily over the past 5 years, and I have been there since the very second that particular forum was made. II used to be nothing but noob spam, so horrid that I lodged complaints to the moderators about it, even going as far as to petition them to shut down the forum. But then I came to the decision that the best way to change II for the better was to roleplay as much as possible and try to inspire people to follow suit, and even though I refuse to outright take credit for the progress the II community has made, one cannot deny that I have been heavily involved with it over the years.''

''I don't care what your opinion of me is, I really don't. I'm in this game to have fun, a concept which seems to be lost on many these days. I know that unless I point fingers, what I say is simply going to be dismissed as "a conspiracy of people that he wouldn't name that did something bad that he wouldn't clearly specify", but I'm not going to waste my time and effort because the people who are to blame KNOW who they are. There is simply no longer any benefit to RPing with Haven because of this stupid personality cult that hangs over it, and those who are apart of it have, in the past, ruined perfectly good RP's because they didn't get their way 100%. Somehow there is this sense of entitlement, this sense that your "opponent" in a RP has to simply bend over and spread 'em because they think their nations and militaries are so much better and cannot be beaten.''

''I however am not going to sit here and act like Gholgoth has never done anything wrong, because we're not so self righteous that we can't admit our faults. We know damn well the mistakes that we've made, and they've been fixed or are in the process of being fixed long term. We were involved in the bickering during the last failed NATO+Gholgoth versus Haven escapade, however this was initiated by HAVEN the second they started reading posts that they didn't agree with (IE:, that didn't result in immediate defeat upon the first attack). You nitpicked that thread to DEATH, and ever since then we have been reluctant to waste any more time with you lot. Since then it's been the little things that have further solidified in our mind that RPing with Haven is useless, and the last Haven war was what sealed the deal for us because several of us tried to get involved in some manner. There is a complete lack of willingness to put your damn egos on hold for the sake of a good story, a complete lack of willingness to cooperate and compromise, and no interest in anything except "winning" at all costs.
''
''But after all, what is "winning" in NationStates? Truth be told there is no such thing, and at the end of the day all that remains is the threads we leave behind, and future waves of RPers will judge this RP community and its members based on those threads and its contents. Those of you in Haven who have seemingly gone out of your way to stomp on the very spirit of cooperative II RP will be remembered for what you do, as corny as it may sound. We in Gholgoth however are choosing to move in a new direction, because WE founded this region for several reasons:
''
''1. We're friends.''
''2. We wanted this region to be known for good RP.''
''3. We wanted to help promote good RP and further strengthen the II community.''

''We thus far have failed at the latter two. We've failed because we've been too focused on this ridiculous rivalry with a group of RPers who, quite frankly cannot RP well. Do NOT misinterpret this as me saying you lot cannot write well, because you CAN and should be commended for your ability to properly use the English language. I say that you cannot RP well because you ignore the very basis for free form RP; cooperation. Without it there isn't a damned thing ANY of us can do, because any sort of progress can only be made if one side allows the other side to make said progress. Nobody in NS is obligated to accept anything anyone does in the slightest, and the only way any of us can do much of anything is if we cooperate with those we interact with. Now, does this mean that all of Gholgoth are great RPers?''

''By my definition, no. We have our shortcomings, and we recognize that. We realize now that there is no point in flaunting any kind of 'supremacy' one may think they have, we realize now that there can be no good RP unless you cooperate and compromise, and bickering over petty details is an absolute waste of time. We intend to change that, because we want to get back to the roots of what this region was founded on by our veteran members; good RP. So needless to say, we plan to do just that. We're going to be broadening our horizons and getting back into the old swing of things, but first there have to be changes. The internal changes I spoke of earlier are being made and will take effort over the long term to succeed, however there is one external change we must make before we can move on.''

''As I said once in this thread already, there is no longer any benefit to RPing with Haven for the reasons I have specified. Therefore Gholgoth has collectively decided that it would be best for us if we no longer RP'd with Haven, because frankly unless Haven works its own kinks out and collectively gets their egos under control and heads out of the clouds, there can be no good RP between us. Since we are no longer RPing with you guys we are also taking ourselves off the map with Haven, so therefore there is no longer a distance issue between us. I'm really sorry to inform the Haven crew of this, but none of you have any say in this decision. We will be placing ourselves on a new map with several other RPing regions, and frankly we do not care what anyone's opinions of them are, nor do we care what your opinions are of our decision. They have all agreed to this and are looking forward to what the future holds. Link.''

''We're going down a new path, and you guys will not be coming with us.''

''Wether or not you consider this an ignore is up to you, but I don't think most people in Gholgoth will be ignoring Haven forever. If perhaps sometime in the future you would like to discuss matters with us in a civil manner, you're more than welcome to do so. However this won't be taking place now or anytime in the immediate future. We have a lot of work to do to better ourselves, and so do you. We wish you guys the best.''

''- Automagfreek''

[[TL;DR]]- Basically AMF is taking his Gholgoth region [[unwarranted self importance|way too seriously]]. It's just a shitty internet forum, there, cowboy. 



Who made it? Fuck if anyone knows, but it's <s>hilarious for 1. [[lolbertarian]]ism and 2.
