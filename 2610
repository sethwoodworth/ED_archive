'''Eingee.com''' is a site that recently spammed [[EQ2Flames]]. To hell and back. LFG got fed up with it and called [[personal army]] on them, except in this case it makes a bit of sense because they are a bunch of [[Chinese]] [[spammers]] selling [[MMORPG]] [[Jew gold]].

{{squote|Yes, I'm going to link a plat site, because the son of a bitch just made 45 new threads here advertising his shitty site and I had to delete them all.

Please go to Eingee.com!, Professional,Reliable,Legal MMO Shop and take that fucking site down for all I care. At least login to his "chat" feature and give him a hearty FUCK YOU ASSHOLE like I just did.

I'm posting this in this section because I seriously doubt anyone who reads this still plays EQ2, let alone would be sad enough to buy plat.

Piss this guy off like he just pissed on our site please.|Oh by the way LFG is a born-again [[Christian]].}}

Within a couple of hours, EQ2Flames ''took down the live chat'' by suggesting that lovebugs were taking over Orlando, spamming WTC theories, using [[4chan]] as a scapegoat, and whatnot. Crabbok suggested, "Now I'm no expert, but toying around with the visitorID number, and setting it to 1 gave me a different screen in which I could upload an attachment. Hmmm, plant a virus on the chinese hackers anyone?"

Crabbok then continued to rack up his [[add to cart]] until it reached INFINITY. This caused a database error. More and more information on the site has been found, including their email, location, and IP. A DDos is probably going to happen soon. Since EQ2Flames has proven in the past that they can really [[Brenlo|fuck]] [[Esachasa|people]] [[Ajjantis|over]], the end will be lol.
