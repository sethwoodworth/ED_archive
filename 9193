X Y is X

'''X Y is X''' (XY=X) is the horrendously overused and [[Old meme|clich√©d]] [[Math|algebraic]] format that [[Chan|*channers]] use to express their feelings towards something. Whether it be [[Love|<3]], [[Hate|h8]], elation, sadness, or even a strong [[Sex|sexual]] urge, this textual [[meme]] is a convenient way for [[you]] to say what's on your mind without actually having to use it. Repeating the adjective creates a descriptive phrase of [[goatse|unholy power]]. Furthermore, it is the primary tool used by [[Anonymous]] when stating the obvious. The general idea is that by repeating yourself and being unnecessarily redundant, your arguments and ideas will make more sense and will cease to be completely idiotic.  As you might have guessed, it doesn't work worth a [[shit]]. 
'''X Y is X''' is an example of [[circular logic]], and has been around for [[At least 100 years|quite some time]], seemingly as long as the [[internets]] themselves. 

==Origin==

The phrase originated from [http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF07 a 1999 episode] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in which Ralph says ''Fun toys are fun''. [[Some argue]] that it originated in [[4chan]], or from the super hard and totally annoying as fuck game La-Mulana, where your faggot character reads a tablet in the Hell Temple that reads, "Hell Temple is Hell." Though of course, [[Nobody cares|it is unlikely that anybody cares]] about that.

==Variations==
Of course, if you're a [[artist|creative]] [[motherfucker]], you can [[Anonymous Borg|alter]] the phrase to better suit your situation. Like when dealing with a [[camwhore]] who won't deliver; "Fat whore is ugly." Or when dealing with a [[Scientology|troublesome organization]]; "Fake religion is crazy." This particular variation is known as '''X Y is Z''', as is the equally logical '''X Y Z is X and Y'''. For maximum difficulty setting one may use '''X X is X''', as in "Troll troll is troll".  There is no recourse from this indefensible maneuver, however, so use with caution.
