'''DivineAngel''' is a whiny [[lol-cow]] and [[Snapesnogger]] wannabe with the grammatical skills of a [[George Bush|monkey]]. She becomes profoundly [[butthurt]] when contradicted, and will throw a tantrum whenever she feels that her rights on DeviantART have been violated.  Like many [[Tartlet|Tartlets]], Divine loves posting [[shit nobody cares about|lulz filled journals]], [[BAW|hiding comments]] and deleting said journals when the trolls come to play.  Putting an interesting spin on things, Divine is also apparently some sort of [[Goth|witch]] threatening to Hex all those who made this ED page.

==Drama==
[[Image:Fiveadam.jpg|thumb|We don't five a dam either, babe.]]
[[Image:Five_in_the_Right_Pocket_by_DivineAngel.jpg|thumb|A print worthy piece of art? Oh snap for all you print artists...her shit ACES yours!]]
The drama was started when another user on [[DeviantART]], MarieChan, told DivineAngel that she would not be able to earn $200 a month by selling her [[shitty]] prints. Hearing this, DivineAngel threw a giant [[E-Tantrum]], posting in the forums as well as making another whiny journal. People soon discovered the plentiful [[lulz]] she provided and flocked to her page.

She also claims to be borderline [[dyslexic]] which she uses to try and explain why her spelling is [[shit]], and why "she can't read the rules." She ignores the fact that plenty of Dyslexic people can do both of those things just fine, and continues to try and use her disability as an excuse for being a [[dumbass]]. 


{{quote|I can't keep up with the rules because I'm borderline dyslexic, I can barely read as it is! |DivineAngel}}

{{quote| Borderline dyslexic means you're almost dyslexic, meaning that it doesn't affect you as much as those who have full blown dyslexia. And I know people with dyslexia who can read perfectly fine, so that's a pretty stupid excuse.|FlyinPingu}}

{{quote| since when did the definition from 10 years ago change? |DivineAngel's response}}

DivineAngel, like her [[hero]], [[Snapesnogger]], doesn't know how to take constructive criticism, and if you offer her any she'll accuse you of insulting her, [[spamming]], [[flaming]], [[trolling]] and cyber [[terrorism]]. She will then hide the offending comment and block you from her page, because she is a spineless [[coward]].


She also enjoys writing long, [[pretentious]] descriptions of her artwork in hopes that people will not notice that it is [[crap]]. 


Here are some examples:


<center><gallery>
Image:Anodetodefiance_by_DivineAngel.gif|DivineAngel defies modern tradition!
Image:Fiveintheright_by_DivineAngel.gif|You just keep telling yourself that. (Defying "tridition" this time.)
Image:Mirrorgeisha_by_DivineAngel.gif|Check out the "grace" and "feminine" appeal!
</gallery></center>



DivineAngel is also intensely paranoid, and seems to believe that the DA staff is ''[[Facepalm|out to get her]]''! She appears to think that they are just ''picking'' on her (never mind that she violated policy by posting [[Kingdom Hearts]] kiddie [[pr0n]] or anything). What DivineAngel needs to realize is that she is, in fact, [[shit nobody cares about|not that important]]. [[Image:Conspiracy_by_DivineAngel.gif|thumb|Get out the tinfoil hats, guys!]]


On more than one occasion, DivineAngel has been shown to have [[internet tough guy]] tendencies, threatening to curse people, hex them, kick their ass, or use her [[Bullshit|majik]] powers on them.

==Pagantastic!==

[[Image:divineangeldawhoop.jpg|thumb|DivineAngel casts a hex.]]
[[Image:Divineangelsgod.jpg|centre]]

DivineAngel is also a [[Pagan]]. Popular definition of pagan is "a person who is not a [[faggot|Christian]], Jew, or Arab." So she could really be ''anything''. But we're going to assume that like most dumbasses on the [[internet]], she thinks it means [[Wiccan]]. 

[[Wicca]] is a [[hippie]] religion often taken up by [[16 year old girls]] in order to appear [[unwarranted self-importance|speshul]] and different from other [[Jailbait|16 year old girls]]. A popular saying that sums up Wiccan ethics is "an it harm none, do what ye will" which means as long as you don't hurt anyone, you can do [[sex|whatever]] [[pr0n|shit]] [[drugs|you]] [[alcohol|want]] [[your mom|to]]. 

As usual DivineAngel is far too [[stupid|important]] to follow any silly rules, so she ignores this saying completely and often threatens to hex people. Too bad for her that Wiccans also believe in "the threefold law", which states that if you do something bad to someone, something bad will happen back to you, but three times worse. OH SNAP!

[[Image:DivineNorris.gif|thumb|Don't fuck with the Celestial Alliance!]]
[[Image:Policyviolation1.png|thumb|The Curse of Hades being on your head.]]
[[Image:Majickpowersdivineangel.jpg|thumb|Bitches don't know bout her majick powers.]]

History has shown that the only way to deal with witches is to burn them. [[Kill it with fire|While setting fire to her body may in fact be a fun project]], ED recommends the burning take the form of pointing out her stupidity in the most [[lulz|lulzworthy]] ways possible. 

'''Methods can include but are not limited to:'''
*Asking how many prints she's sold yet.
*Telling her the ''real'' definition of dyslexia.
*Commenting with true and useful tips on improving her artwork.
*Trying to explain that "constructive criticism" doesn't need to have something positive in it.
*Making fun of her inability to read and follow rules.
*Leaving so many comments that it's hard for her to hide them all.
*Correcting her grammar or spelling.
*Screencapping her stupidity.
*Telling her Paganism is a fairytalistic religion.
*Going to her page and letting her know just how retarded she really is.
*Ask for video proof that she really is an angel and see if she can fly off a building.  If not, she fails herself.
*Talking to her for five consecutive minutes.
*And adding to this Article.


DivineAngel also often mysteriously refers to some sort of higher beings. Are they her heathen gods? Or... ''something else?!'' She also seems to believe that she has <s>magikal</s> majikal powers! We have collected many of these puzzling quotes for your [[lulz|inspection.]]

*<i>"DO NOT ever dare attack my original art again little whore, Because it will be of the supernatural that you would to face"

*"you have no idea the power I have do you."

*"when will tyou fucking learn KARMA IS REAL! and if you sin in my presence well you are about to find out why im called DivineAngel!"

*"You badmouthed my friend Belittled me And pissed off a Celestial [[Buttsecks|Alliance]], lucky for you they are letting me handle you personally! And don’t think you are going to get off easy."

*"[[bix_nood|Vek no almen tel dor naeem!]]"

*"ALAH HU ACKBAR MAJIK JIHADI!"

</i>


[[shit nobody cares about|What "powers" does she possess? What is this about the "supernatural"? And what exactly is the ''"Celestial Alliance"''?]] All this and more, in next week's episode!

==It's a TRAP!==

[[Image:DivineAngel Drama-5.jpg|right|thumb|IT'S A TRAP!]]

After much trolling, Divine lifted her head high and scoffed in the face of ED and [[troll|all those that opposed her]]. It was all a trap! Turns out it was all a [[stupid|clever]] ploy to get various Trolls and Unsavory Types brought to the attention of the DeviantART Staff!  Too bad DA Admins don't actually give a fuck about what goes on with their website.
[[Image:IMA CHARGIN MY MOONBEAM!.png|left|thumb|Even [http://moonbeam13.deviantart.com/journal/13885005/ $Moonbeam13] thinks DivineAngel is retarded!]]

{{quote| we have been trying this for a long time since before you knew us this all was a TRAP |DivineAngel|}}

{{quote| Congrats you LULZ scum you fell right into the trap! |DivineAngel|}}

{{quote| I haev to thank the LULZ for falling so willingly into this little Trap! NOW all that is left if for the Deviant Staff to sort out the ones they don't want here and the ones that are just curious and brave. |DivineAngel|}}

{{quote|and well said my dear but I must reveal that it was indeed a set up! we lined em up like little ducks for the staff here. Anti Idiot has been trying to kill lulz for 10 years now, or at least reveal their true colors. |DivineAngel|}}

{{quote| I have to thank all you ducks for lining up like good little mallards!|DivineAngel}}
[[Image:EDfro.JPG|thumb|we've been ignoring ED fro too long!!]]

{{quote| NO more off topic posting our mission is a success, we have all the screen shots we will ever need. thanks to Divine Angel's effort, we now know the lulz are a bunch under-age hoodlums that think violating ethnic standers is "cool" any help in bringing the full party of the lulz to justice will be appreciated. |DivineAngel pretending to be someone else - on the full party of the lulz}}

{{quote| Oh Anti Idiot set up a trap for lulz but it appears the DA staff isn't interested in removing them from the sight.|DivineAngel - saying why we never felt the repercussions of this trap.}}

Well, we'd better give up now, guys! But congratulations to DivineAngel on learning a NEW WORD! I'm sure "lulz" (she uses it as an adjective AND a pronoun to replace [[Anon]]... lulz) will be a very useful addition to your vocabulary... once you actually learn how to use it properly!

==That's ENOUGH ==
[[Image:Divinangels drama pic.jpg|thumb|The image in question]]
[[Image:Divineangel_peckingfest.jpg|thumb|Miraculously, while Divine actually ''did'' spell "foul" the correct way, it's still a funny pun.]]


On July 11th, DivineAngel posted this journal (which has now been deleted), bitching because one of her [[Kingdom Hearts]] fanarts were removed due to [[CP|child pornography]]. Although softcore, it broke [http://help.deviantart.com/565/ devianTART's submission policy] because, like your typical dumbshit, she drew a condom in his mouth; and devianTART thinks condoms are "sex toys." She refers to the Admins as "idiots" [[irony|even though she later sought help from them to get rid of us]]. DivineAngel thinks she should be an exception to the rules, because she is dyslexic and can't read them.

[[Image:Thatsenough.jpg|DivineAngel has had enough of this faggotry!|centre]]


When DivineAngel had her fifteen minutes of fame during the [[DivineAngel#Journal RAPE|epic journal rape of July 24th]], the admins of devianTART came to ED to see why she was so [[butthurt|popular]]. They must've felt like inept morons when they revisited the "condom is a sex toy" argument, and on July 29th, they decided to [http://news.deviantart.com/article/31841/ rewrite the rules as they saw fit], so they wouldn't look like [[Fox News|retards]]. You can read the new rule [http://help.deviantart.com/248/ here], but it basically says '''"STOP DRAWING KINGDOM HEARTS/HARRY POTTER PORN!!1"'''

==The Lawyer==

On July 18th, DivineAngel posted this to her journal on deviantART, [[E-lawyer|threatening]] ED with [[Internet lawsuit|lawlsuit]]. Everyone on Encyclopedia Dramatica called her bluff because we all know she doesn't have the brain capacity to open the Yellow Pages and find a real lawyer. Any reply to this journal that predicted the lawsuit would fall flat on its face because it was made of [[fail]], [[AIDS]] and [[Crybaby|tears]].

'''The lawyer'''

*'''Journal Entry: Wed Jul 18, 2007, 6:17 PM'''

<i>Well this is an amusing story, I was making lunch and I got a call from a Lawyer from out of town. I‘m sure you guys are aware that I have been researching the topic of Encyclopedia Drematica, misquotes and dramatizations.

It turns out when I told Vlad about the d-boards removal he was trying to target members of E.D. in attempts to show them how it felt to their unfortunate victims he is sorry if any one who wasn’t a member wound up in the crossfire.

As for E.D. it turns out THEY ARE NOT protected under the first amendment rights act mainly for misquotes and Deformation of character. Because they have world wide audiences they are actually subject to worse rules than the magazines or papers.

Now I still have to get my dads opinion in the matter in fact I know hes got a reliable Lawyer on speed dial for work purposes since some retailers have taken to wanting to target him when the accountant screws up.

(update)

Just got off the phone to see my options, and I have a announcement to make From now on I'm running a Smear against E.D. Just because they are overseas DOES NOT exempt them from using standard moral practices!

that whatever government decided to protect them might want to think again. Americans have rights and other country's should respect throws rights eve if they don't wish to practice them them selfs.</i>

Later on, DivineAngel edited her "The Lawyer" journal, saying that EDiots have fallen into another one of her [[stupid|ingenious]] traps! Not only is she a magician, she is also a [[failure|world class troll!]] Good one guys, [[amiright]]?


'''The lawyer'''

*'''Journal Entry: Wed Jul 18, 2007, 6:17 PM'''

<i>Wow you guys have got to be kidding me? and you called me gullible one.

The call was to inform me that my brothers case was taken care of and they wanted me to relay the message.

as for the rest of it gee who's laughing now?</i>

==A Serious Competitor Approaches==

As hinted at in [[DivineAngel/Logs|her chat logs]] DivineAngel planned on giving the oppressive, [[Nazi]] minors who run DeviantART a run for their money by creating her own [[art]] site that will allow things that are against DeviantART's apparently ill-defined, unclear, strict rules that don't protect artists from violating them. There was [[Sheezyart|some other artfag website that tried this]] and they just ended up becoming DeviantART Jr.


*'''Journal Entry: Fri Jul 20, 2007, 1:04 PM'''

<i>Ya, that’s right. I can’t tolerate this anymore there isn’t enough red tape for the removal of a deviation, too little clarity on what’s what in the rules and posting policy and a bunch of other thing I’m sure this page could prosper without. One being the indiscreet individuals that troll around hunting for prey or “lulz’s” as thy call it, but that’s another matter.

So I think it’s High time Deviant Art got a little “Serious Competition” they say it does a business good. I’m sick of all the horrifyingly putrid stuff they allow, stuff that could be avoided if they simply thought about it a little more. I’m aware they have to abide by strict rules being a US based business and all but that shouldn’t exempt them from protecting the artist or their forums of self expression no matter what they are. I use to think so highly of this site, now I’m not sure what to think.</i>



==Journal RAPE==
On July 24th, in response to DivineAngel becoming a featured article on Encyclopedia Dramatica and an extremely easy to troll lulz-cow, she posted a journal stating that she and her friend "Tsuki"  mooned us all on her forum; where after DivineAngel and her imaginary friend Tsuki (which  is actually [[weeaboo]] speak for "moon") had much lawls over their imaginary [[fail|victory]]. For a long time, the journal had only three replies, which were all hidden; and then nothing happened because nobody gave a crap and knew she was making it all up. Then later, some real [[fucktard|heroes]] by the name of [http://Whuzzup.deviantart.com Whuzzup] and [http://RetardSmasher.deviantart.com RetardSmasher] spammed the hell out of her journal and main page. The damage to her journal was so extensive it actually became the "most popular" journal in deviantART garnering it plenty more attention. The admins took one look at the journal and said "fuck this shit, I'm not cleaning this mess up" and made her baleet the journal.

=DivineAngel KNOWS ART=

Step aside! DivineAngel knows [[Art|Art]]. Below is a collection of screen caps displaying Divines' inability to accept critique, and refusal to answer simple questions that even the shittiest of artists would know. 

{{cg|Screenshots|baawGallery|center|<gallery>
Image:DivineAngel_DRAMA.jpg|Don't you get it, guys? Quality doesn't matter! it's all about the simplicity of art!
Image:DivineAngel_DRAMA-2.jpg|I suggest you get shots in case she goes through with that threat. What if her crazy is contagious?!
Image:DivineAngel_DRAMA-3.jpg|DivineAngel don't need no edumacation! SHE KNOWS ART!

Image:In scifi anatomy doesn't matter.jpg|Omg scifi is suppose to be weird.
Image:Memberofartleague.JPG|oh shit son!, she's a member of an art league!..
</gallery>}}


As we can see here, she clearly knows what she's talking about. This is no doubt due to her years of traveling the world as a pagan witch god, and a secret agent against ''The Lulz Organization''. She's probably seen and done it all! How could anyone ever compare? 

She seems to dabble in a number of media, marker being her apparent favorite. She utilizes childlike simplicity and purposely makes her art [[shitty|bad]] to make the [[crap|simplicity]] more pronounced. She also signs nearly each of her pictures with her username, and a finger print. It is unknown what is used to produce this fingerprint, but one could assume it is the blood of all the Lulz Members that she killed with her mind powers.

It is unknown why she doesn't utilize their blood into more of her artwork. Perhaps it is too curdled for her artistic needs!


=It Was My Roommate!=

[[Image:DivineA-Roommate.jpg|frame|center|Divine trying to squirm out of this whole mess]]

In her latest attempt to banish the mirthful [[troll]]s from her DeviantART page, and possibly as her attempt at a [[final solution]], Divine is now claiming the shenanigans she's spawned over the past month or so were not her doing, but a [[lie|mysterious male roommate]] of hers that apparently has access to her DeviantART and MSN and forum accounts. Yes, everything between July 15th and August 23rd, the hexing, the cursing, the ethnic standers, the [[butthurt]], was all carried out by this roommate while the real Divine was away at a "[[douchebag|cleansing]]". Note the similar method of typing, where it looks like someone was fucking with her and disconnecting her keyboard as she was typing, resulting in her horrible spelling.


[[Image:Room-mate, yeah right, fucking liar.png|frame|center|[http://divineangel.deviantart.com/journal/14306885/ This nearly indecipherable message] pins everything on not DivineAngel]]


Divine managed to post the above journal with little to no spelling errors and halfway decent grammar as part of her ''clever ruse'', but after that it seemed like she couldn't be bothered to run all her comments through a spellchecker and the "real" Divine started to sound a whole lot like the mysterious masquerading roommate. After DivineAngel realized that nobody was swallowing her bullshit lies, she baleeted the journal and left the interwebs until she can think up another clever cover. 

===Becoming the Roommate===
Soon after OMG LEAVING TEH INTARWEBZ, DivineAngel brought her faggotry to a whole new level by posing as her [[weeaboo]] "roommate" on DevianTART as [http://ladyhisoka.deviantart.com LadyHisoka]. [[Fail| How clever.]] In spite of failed attempts to clean up her grammar and pose as a respectable member of the TART community, if such a person exists, she was quickly found out due to her fatal inability to spell ''ethic standards'' properly and her general inclination to be a complete [[fucktard]]. It would also have helped if she had thought to ''not'' post the exact same birth date as her original persona claimed to be, but perhaps that's just [[unrealistic expectations|expecting too much from her]]. She nonetheless continued to deny the whole thing and be a self-righteous [[e-go]]-whore.

===And now it's some butthurt haxxor.===
DivineFatass has been bringing her finger-pointing faggotry and fake conspiracy theories to [[Sheezyart]].
In a twist that surprises absolutely no one, her story has changed dramatically, and now her dumbshit behavior was caused by someone on [[FanFiction.Net]], instead of her pretend "roommate."

[[Image:Ladyhisoka-SheezyFucktard.png|frame|center|"HES JUST JEALOUS OF HER MAD FF.NET SKEELZ!" Also, [[retard|she actually believes Shittyart staff can do anything about affairs on a completely different site.]]]]

=DivineOrgy=
[[Last Thursday]], DivineAsshole made the [[retarded| tactically ingenious]] decision to fend off the trolls by employing all of her accounts, including [http://scarletdivine.deviantart.com a brand new incarnation of evil]. She continued to claim that [[lie| one of the accounts was her roommate]], who had also taken control of her original account to keep her off the TART, in spite of overwhelming evidence.

[[Image:DivineConfessions2.jpg|thumb|right| Another trap??]]
[[Image:DivineConfessions.jpg|thumb|right| PART TWO.]]

After several days and [[at least 100|at least a 1000]] more idiotic posts about her fake roommate, her connection with [[Raptor Jesus|a higher power]], and general denial of several counts of being a complete [[fuckwit]], Divine finally succeeded in [[ban fucking everyone|banning fucking everyone]] except a handful of trolls and soon-to-be-banned TARTlets who either [[WTF|''actually bought her bullshit'']], or were just toying with her at this point. She then tried to woo over some of the remainder by claiming to have been [[It was a social experiment|experimenting with trolling]]. [[bullshit|LOL IT WAS ALL A JOKE GUYZ YOU CAN STOP NOW.]] Her [[lolcow]] tendencies have continued to arise since then, however, and frequently.<br>

[[Image:TheDivineUltimatum.jpg|frame|center|ZOMG LEAVING FOREVERS YOU MEANIE EDEEDEEDEES!!]]<br>

[[Last Thursday|This Thursday]], Divine posted a new journal entry on her ScarletDivine account, spewing the same [[attention whore]] [[shit]] as always, while stating that she can nevar return to devianTART evar again due to extreme [[butthurt]]. Of course she's still been posting new [[shit nobody cares about|contests]] and delivering [[witty]] retorts as always, but we can only hope [[Stop posting|it will truly end soon]]. Though many of us know this will probably not be the last we see of DivineLolcow, we can also stand to say good fucking riddance you [[fat]] [[Virgin|fucking]] [[weeaboo]] [[shitting dick nipples|TARTlet]].

One week ago the [[tartlet]] updated her journal to attempt public humiliation on another DeviantART. After much [[lulz]] and [[fail]] in the badly written and poor skills of [[trolling]], she still believes she is above us all. yet the most funny shit about this is the [[Lolcow|lulzcow's]] journal in its self is against [[DeviantART]] rules, but she can't get banned, she is the [[DivineAngel]]! Besides, the [[admins]] are too afraid she might give them cancer to ban the [[fucktard]].

===The Hurricane and the New Sock Puppet===

Many wondered, with the new presence of LadyHisoka taking the DivineAngel Drama Wheel, what actually happened to the -original- DivineAngel?  Well, that's obvious.  A Hurricane had her locked away in Houston Texas.  Conveniently for us she could communicate psychic-ly though LadyHisoka.

=And Everything Else=

===Assorted Shit===
[[Image:albhedinese.jpg|thumb|left|Jibba Jabba]]
[[Image:Clause.jpg|thumb|right|ConceptART]]

Various tidbits of shit that did not require the massive paragraphs they had.
*Once in an effort to prove she really was a witch, Divine once started speaking in tongues. A random TART cleared things up when they revealed that it was [[Dork|Al Bhed]](A made up language from Final Faggoty), and she was merely running most of her posts through a [http://www.pixelscapes.com/twoflower/albhed.html translator]. 
*ConceptArt, a popular trolling tool since Snapesnogger, was used on Divine. It failed though, not because she was smart but because she claimed they had a 'fine arts' clause.  They don't have such a clause. However, they do probably have a talent clause, and her shitty art will be torn apart. 
*On [[April_furs_day|April 1st]], 2008, the DevianTART staff replaced every avatar image on the site with [[Mudkips]]. Like hundreds of other [[16 year old girls]], DivineAngel pitched a bitch and threatened to sue. Evidence 'Mudkipz Part 1 and 2' can be found in the Screenshot Gallery
*Some troll drew mocking art of Divine/Lady Hisoka (as seen in Troll Art below), she called him out on the Complaints Forum. He poasted 5-6 fucking paragraphs about this shit.
*Some other troll tried to get Divine to uphold her end of a Art Challenge, predictably she did not.  Said other troll also posted way too many paragraphs about this unlulzy shit. 
*Divine under the guise of LadyHisoka was suspected with creating [[The Anti-ED-Club]].
*There are tons of long winded conversations with the nutball over [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/DivineAngel/Logs here!]

===Screenshots===

An assload of screenshots, because for some reason, people think that every goddamn thing this TARTlet says and does deserves to be on this page. Most of these aren't even that lulzy.
