'''Vandalize.us''', formerly known as '''Vandal CORP''' (url dropped by registrar for abuse and massive [[fail]]) is a website where [[vandal]]s meet up to wreak havoc on other websites. It is another [[leet]] organization of [[13-year-old boy]]s unleashing the power of the [[This is a wiki so I will vandalize it, thanks.|edit button]] and third-rate [[crapflood]]ing upon the Internet. Group members claimed that their leader was [[Fursecution fox|Fox McCloud]]. 

It gained popularity among the [[Counterstrike]] and IGN.com crowd after their assault on [[Wikichan]], but they have turned tail and are currently sucking [[cocks]]. [[Conspiracy theories]] suggest that said vandals had their computer privileges taken away. 

==[[Fail|Triumphs]]==
A list of [[Shit nobody cares about|well-known]] websites they took down through e-Terrorism.

*http://www.davetronz.com (2007)
*http://www.dragaonballcentral.com (2004)
*http://www.spirit-gun.net (2006)
*http://www.dranet.com (2004)
*http://www.hallmark.com (temporarily)
*http://www.dbzgameinfo.com (2004)
*http://www.skynet-tech.com (2004)

Note that most of these sites are hardly worth mentioning as taking them down is actually a sign of weakness. LOL, "HARDCORE"

== Wikichan Raid ==
Wikichan <strike>is currently</strike> was under heavy raids. Most of their images have been replaced with boo. Not that this is a particularly notable achievement, since Wikichan is so poorly coded and anyone with actual moderating powers is never online, that everyone and their retarded grandmother could do it.

==E-death==
As of [[Last Thursday]], VandalCorp had ceased vandalism attempts on Wikichan. Sometime afterwards, their vandalize.us website was taken down, and a few days later, killthisfaggot.com, a related website, was unplugged as well.
