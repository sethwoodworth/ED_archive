'''Realalover''' is a batshit psychotic [[Wolfeedarkfang|furry civil rights leader]] alter-ego of [[ Ravda ]], who joined the fandumb in order to "[[retard|leave her humanity behind]]" and get in touch with the nature around her and leave the greedy heathen hyoomuns off to perish in "their own Armageddon". In between posting her [[Shit|socially conscience YouTube vlogs]], she enjoys dragging her neighbors to town to enjoy some furfaggin' and making [[Gorillaz]] movies with [[sockpuppets]].

==Butchers, the Lot of Them!==
[[File:Card the dryad-wall.jpg|thumb|right|This is what Realalover actually believes.]]
Infuriated by the greedy, unnatural human process known as "[[work|brush removal]]", Realalover grabbed her webcam and videotaped the woodland rape while expressing that such this very rape of [[hippy|Mother Earth]] was the reason she is not a human but a furry. [[True|Which is totally different]].

Expressing [[Shocked and appalled|sheer terror]] at the fact that someone would find it at all conceivable that getting rid of a tree that consistently shat hundred plus pound branches over their homes, Realalover expressed that, because of her belief in [[Lord of the Rings|Dryads]] and magic, that the [[Mexicans|lumberjacks]] were literally torturing and killing a sentient being, in the process starving [[Disney|innocent woodland creatures]]. Pointing out that "[[Irrelevant|trees and termites have been around since the dawn of time]]" and seemingly unable to comprehend why any disgusting human wouldn't want that shit caving in their homes, Realalover gives up and proceeds to talk about how [[Wolfaboo|how wolves eating their children is beautiful and keeping the natural order]] and how Sarah Palin wants to kill all of them, because humans feel compelled to [[for the lulz|"just mess with shit"]] and that furry is the only way to escape the insanity.

Because of magic.

==Taking It To the Streets==

Not content with just fighting the good fight online, Realalover eventually decided the needed to take the fight straight to the enemy, and headed off to the Target.

Deciding that screaming at customers was the only [[logic|logical]] way to gain respect, Realalover and the gang shouted at several people before [[gtfo|jetting away from the scene]] and relishing the days activities.

===Let's Get the Neighbors Involved===

Feeling the need to share the excitement, Realalover figured a screaming match with Target customers was the best way to socialize with her neighbors. [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|Who evidently agreed]].

Because when you go out screaming with furfags, you're gonna wanna tell people.

==Gorillaz Faggotry==

In between raging, Realalover likes to ease back, shove her hands into her crusty socks and have fun with her bestest buds the [[Gorillaz]].
