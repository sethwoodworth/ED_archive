[[Image:Eq2_gnome_nude.jpg|thumb|right|Unfortunately for you, [[sick fuck]], this is only a mod.]]


'''''[http://everquest2.com/ EverQuest II]''''' is the [[Shit|shitty]] sequel for ''[[EverQuest]]'' and a furniture-collecting game. It is made by [[SOE]] and was released on November 8, [[2004]], just a couple weeks before ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' - while WoW soon became the largest hub of [[basement dwellers]], EQ2 still kept on trucking and, being a MMO, still harbors a ton of [[lulz]] (and [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7796482.stm faggotry, no kidding]) within it. Even though it does have lulz, it still stays in the shadow of the [[World of Warcraft|better game]].

==Storyline==


[[Image:Grimwell_blush.png|thumb|left|GRIMWELL LIEK [[Btard|/b/TARD]]]]

500 years after EQ1, the Gods got sick of [[atheists]] attempting to kill them repeatedly, and created [[Hurricane Katrina|the Shattering]]. The Shattering tore apart the world of Norrath, burying cities, [[Rachel Corrie|crushing protesters with bulldozers]], forced many out of their homes, and made the two major cities, Qeynos and Freeport, into refuges for the [[homeless]] people. [[Ghetto|Ghettos]] sprang up around both cities, except Freeport's are actually full of [[gangstas]] who will bust a sword in [[you|yo]] [[ass]]. Many of the original cities from EQ1 were annihilated or taken over by [[robots]], [[zombies]], [[niggas]], [[furries]], or [[juggalos]] - and the [[Fag|adventurers]] must plunder each for loot. Oh, and kill dragons. And somehow, a lot of [[Shit bands|Van Halen]] references are involved. Oh, and the Goddess of Love dies. [[Shit no one cares about|But who really cares about the storyline]]?
{{clear}}

==Gameplay and Features==
[[Image:Eq2_mohammed.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The Prophet [[Mohammad]], as depicted by [[SOE]]. Somehow, they're safe from angry [[Muslims]].]]

The gameplay of ''EverQuest II'' is similar to WoW's more than EQ1's - basically, making EQ2 a [[Lol|casual]] EQ1. There's the combat, which is pretty much like EQ1 or WoW's except with [[Over 9000|about 500]] more buttons to click. In fact, the UI is so fucked that the player has to actually download a whole new UI mod in order to make the game actually playable.

There are also raids, which are extremely boring, except they only consist of 12-24 people, because if there is more than 24 people in one zone, the game will fucking [[rape]] your face off and melt your [[PC]] because the game is very [[Crysis|GPU-intensive]] for being something from [[2004]]. Other than that, raids still cause bitchfights over dropped [[Crap|rings and gems and shit]] as usual. Basically, it's like every other MMO after EQ1, and nothing special.

However, there is a housing system that's actually [[OH WOW|pretty awesome]], and acts like a less creepy ''[[Second Life]]''. It's also a great trolling tactic if some [[retard]] allows you [[friends only]] access into their house, because you can put [[300]] [[Spider pig|pigs]] in there and steal the rest of their shit.

''EverQuest II'' is also well-known for having A-list celebrities for the NPC's voices, such as [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU3tuFGzbbw Christopher Lee and Heather Graham]. How they were able to get them to do this is a mystery. SOE also added voices to player characters with the ''[[Arab|Desert of Flames]]'' expansion, which are primarily used by roleplayers, and trolls - by far the most [[annoying]] emote is the [[Troll's remorse|"I'm sorry!"]] saying that a character says after being hit by a snowball. Why someone would apologize [[Wat|being ''hit'' with a snowball]] makes no sense, but fine.

One of the [[Lol|greatest]] features for the game was the [[pizza]]-ordering command [http://everquest2.station.sony.com/pizza/ implemented ingame in 2005]. This caused [[Blizzard]] to make a parody called [http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/pandaren-xpress.html "Panda"], where [[Fake|one could order Chinese food ingame.]] [[Lulz]] erupted in both the EQ2 and WoW communities. [[Noone|Nobody]] knows if anyone actually used the "[[fat|/pizza]]" command.

==Races==
[[Image:Eq2_lucancosplayer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Faggot|Sir Lucan D'Lere]]]]
[[Image:Eq2_pizza.jpg|thumb|right|Yes, this was an actual promotion in [[2005]].]]
[[Image:EQ2_nagas.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Sony|SOE]] knows [[Snapesnogger|Nagas]].]]
EQ2 has too many races. Want to be a [[WTF|highlighter-yellow frog wearing nothing but hot pink sweatpants wielding a green-laser sword]]? Go ahead, and then [[kill yourself]] right afterward, you crazy shit.

===Good===

[[Image:Zombie_froglok.jpg|thumb|[[Zombie|BRAINSSSS]]]]

The good races can start in Kelethin, a [[not gay]] place filled with elves and fairies, or the snow-and-beer-covered [[Viking|Halas]].

*'''[[Battletoads|Frogloks]]''' - Speaking in Shakespearean dialect, the frogloks are a race of devout paladins and holy warriors that were created when [[Jesus|Mithaniel Marr]] decided to troll everyone in Norrath and make the frogs into [[Anthro|anthropomorphic]] beings. This is the greatest race to be in a [[MMORPG]], period. Everything else sucks.

*'''[[White|High Elves]]''' - With their blonde hair and blue eyes, the high elves consider themselves pure and pristine and better than everyone else. Hidden racism can be discovered within the game, since their original home was Felwithe - an anagram of [[White pride|"white elf"]].

*'''[[Hippy|Wood Elves]]''' - If [[Al Gore]] played EQ2, he would play a wood elf. Wood elves still worship the trees like they do in EQ1, except now they live amongst the glittery fae.

*'''[[Fairy|Fae]]''' - Released in ''EverQuest II'' with the ''Echoes of Faydwer'' expansion pack. These colorful little faggots were fun for a day or two, and everyone who wasn't a [[Wiccan]] or [[homosexual]] promptly [[Delete fucking everything | deleted]] the character. The only good thing about these guys is that they can glide. However, it's not the best idea to do this on a PVP server, because well, [[Fucked|once you're hit by an arrow]]...

*'''[[Lord of the Rings|Halflings]]''' - Still [[Jenkem|jumjum]]-obsessed as usual, still short, fat, and lame as ever. It is every player's duty to report every single one named some sort of variant of "Frodo".

*'''[[Viking|Dwarfs]]''' - The dwarfs have gotten more surly in EQ2. Then again, so would you, if [[furries]] took over your homeland, wouldn't you? The Asian models for the female dwarfs lack beards because beards are not [[kawaii]]. @w@

<br><br>
===Evil===

[[Image:Bearded_Dragon.jpg|thumb|The bearded dragon is actually an [[irl]] Iksar.]]

On the other hand, the evil races start in the underground city, Neriak, or Gorowyn, a city full of [[Mercenaries 2|mercenaries]].

*'''[[Trolls]]''' - The trolls are basically the essence of [[stupid]], some being so retarded that they have to nail their clothes on or [[DO NOT WANT|they forget to wear them]]. They also will fry anything because it tastes like [[Chicken|chikinz]].

*'''[[Fat|Ogres]]''' -  The most famous ogre is Boomba, and he sells [[Sonichu|pickles]].

*'''[[Hate|Dark Elves]]''' - The most popular race in the game. This is probably because they are [[bondage]]-obsessed hate-preaching purple douchebags, which greatly appeal to the RPfags. '''OVERPOWERED.'''

*'''[[Russia|Ratonga]]''' - [[Jewish]] rats that steal everything from everyone else, speak with Russian accents, and live in the sewers. They're considered [[kawaii|cute]] but who the fuck would think a [[Redundant|bloodthirsty, greedy Jew]] is cute?!

*'''[[Nazi|Iksars]]''' - These lizardmen enjoy [[Holocaust|starving, tormenting, gassing, and beating their enemies]]. When it comes to [[rule 34]], these guys will always be raping something.

*'''[[FYIAD|Sarnaks]]''' - An iksar scientist named Dominus Atrebe created this race after forcing other iksars to have sex with dragons. The resulting race became the sarnak, [[Xbox|hueg]] reptiles that sound like [[Asians]], with the females being twice the size of the males. Other than that you can't tell them apart.

*'''[[Vampire Freaks|Arasai]]''' - SOE, knowing that most straight men would never play as a Fae, attempted to make an evil, badass counterpart. Instead, the Arasai turned out [[emo]]. People only play Arasai for the wings (they can glide) and that's really about it. Their wings look like something you'd find on [[deviantART]].
<br><br>
===Neutral===
These races can start in almost any city. [[Duh]].

*'''[[You|Humans]]''' - Humans are pretty much good at nothing but are best at getting around in the [[Detroit|city]]. They are also responsible for forcing every other race into poverty. Female humans are fugly in EQ2.

*'''[[Nigeria|Erudites]]''' - In EQ1, the erudites were incredibly intelligent black people with dreads. For some reason, they all contracted [[Bald|alopecia]], turned gray, and grew glowing tattoos on their bodies within 500 years. This isn't explained, and the lore developers are too lazy to explain this. The most famous erudite, Miragul, a lich, keeps his soul in a phylactery - a school full of bongs. Some things we can't make up.

*'''[[Cat|Kerra]]''' - Easily mistaken for the Vah Shir, the furfag race that became extinct in EQ1. Then the Erudites discovered [[Second Life|Kerra Isle]], and made them their bitches. Because the Erudites are intelligent, they took this opportunity to troll the Kerra as much as possible. Unfortunately for both, they landed in the same [[ghetto]] in Freeport. For a while, there used to be an NPC in said ghetto that would cry "RUN FOR THE HILLS!" all the fucking time and everyone would avoid that place until 2006 when the fuckers finally moved his whiny ass to an abandoned place in the [[Africa|Commonlands]].

*'''[[Hot Topic|Half Elves]]''' - Members of this race have decided to become non-conformists, just like everybody else! They have hair that would make ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' characters shocked, and therefore look ridiculous when they have hats on.

*'''[[Midget|Gnomes]]''' - After their homeland was raped by robots, the gnomes made [[Unfunny|Gnomeland Security]], or scattered into one of the cities. Gnomes never bathe because they're too busy making [[Terrorist|bombs]]. [[Katy]] plays as one of these because gnomes are obsessed with robots and "[[Doom|DOOOOOOM xD!1]]" Gnome and gnome jokes are never funny, but the developers keep thinking it's hilarious!

*'''[[Age of Conan|Barbarians]]''' - Due to [[global warming]], the Barbarian city of Halas melted, so now the Barbarians have to live in the warmer cities. They complain about this often while downing about 400 [[Beer|beers]] a day. However, due to [[Climategate]], Halas was rediscovered.

===???===
*'''[[Faggots|Freeblood Vampires]]''' - Announced early December of 2010. No, really. What the fuck. [http://everquest2.com/news/read/current/3774 Proof here.] This is obviously meant to [[troll]] Blizzard's ''Cataclysm'' with its worgen/werewolves.

==Classes==

[[Image:Anna_Wainscoat_Antonia_Bayle.jpg|thumb|right|A woman cosplaying as [[Antonia Bayle]], who is masturbated to often.]]

[[Image:Lord-pantz.jpg|thumb|right|A [[typical]] EQ2 player.]]

[[File:Imtithal.png|thumb|right|THE FUCK U JUST SAY 2 ME BITCH]]

Most MMOs have classes, and ''EverQuest II'' is no exception. However, EQ2 has <font size=5>TOO MANY FUCKING CLASSES</font>, causing everything to be imbalanced [[at least 100]] percent of the time. The developer who works on the classes frequently picks a class out of a hat to nerf (except the assassin.)

[[Image:Hyena2.jpg|thumb|left|This is what Freeport looks like, after the Overlord let in all the poor people.]]


*'''[[Cho|Assassins]]''' - Loved by the (former) developer [[Aeralik]], Assassins are trendy as fuck to play as, especially on the PvP servers. They're overpowered and dress like [[ninjas]] in the later levels. Usually played by [[13 year-old boy|13 year-old boys]]. Overpowered.

*'''[[Viking|Berserkers]]''' - A tank class that's broken as shit and has major ADHD. They look like vikings and they wield huge axes while going absolutely [[batshit]] on everyone. Everyone who played as one has probably changed to the less-broken guardian.

*'''[[Black people|Brigands]]''' -  The evil thief class that allows players to gain [[moar]] [[money]] easily. Usually they end up [[Cripple|crippling]] their foes in combat after they've looted all of their gold.

*'''[[Domestic violence|Bruisers]]''' - Evil kung-fu users who have decided that patience and tranquility in martial arts was for faggots and took up street fighting instead. They end up looking like karate guys anyway, except they'd prefer knocking out a few teeth during a sparring match.

*'''[[Child abduction|Coercers]]''' - Enchanters that are evil and like to [[rape|possess]] their enemies and use them to fight so they don't take the hits. Excellent for trolling, since you can release aggressive monsters on people and watch them wipe out.

*'''Conjurors''' - Elemental-summoners that conjure up Earth, fire, wind, water, and heart beings from magic, and are primarily used for DPS. They are not as popular as their evil counterpart, the necromancers, because summoning moving statues and fire snakes is pussy compared to dead things.

*'''[[Vandal|Defilers]]''' - The evil one of the two classes that can summon a little [[wolf]] buddy that can fight along with them. Too bad the wolves are worth shit. [[Tim Buckley]] plays this class.

*'''[[WHEN I WAS|Dirges]]''' - An emo bard that plays depressing music and make their foes [[Cutting|self-harm]]. Seriously. That's what they do. They also scream while they sing. For whatever reason they can run really fast.

*'''[[Fury|Furies]]''' - A class that can turn into a [[lion]] and heals people over time. They are one of the two classes that can make [[portals]], which are another excellent raid trolling tactic - if you click the portal, you're immediately transported to its corresponding area.

*'''[[Guardian|Guardians]]''' - A tank class that everyone plays. They can take a beating but don't do much in return. Mostly played by 20 year-old men who shout at raids over voicechat, and the occasional [[loli]]. They can get hit by a [[Big Rigs|truck]] and still live.

*'''[[Penn and Teller|Illusionists]]''' - This good class can create a [[sockpuppet]] for themselves and use it in battle, and [[Epilepsy|distract enemies with dazzling flashing lights]]. In PvP, the dazzling flashing lights has been known to make people [[Butthurt|complain]] when they are attacked by an illusionist.

*'''[[Monty Python|Inquisitors]]''' - [[Pope]]-hat wearing evil clerics. Nobody expects them.

*'''[[Wapanese|Monks]]''' - Unlike the evil bruiser, a Monk is a spiritual fighter than can [[Randomcasualty|make people think they're dead]] and heal themselves in combat. If there is a video on YouTube of them, it ''will'' feature the song "Kung Fu Fighting".

*'''[[Magic|Mystics]]''' - A good class that summons [[Sparkledogs|ghost dogs]] and use wards on the tank classes so they don't bitch as much when they eventually take damage. They wear bear hats. Women over the age of 30 like to play as these.

*'''[[Goth|Necromancers]]''' - A class that everyone and their dog plays, because it's so [[Metal (music)|metal]] to summon vampires and liches and [[Spiderman|spidermen]] and shit. Many of their attacks include [[cutting]] themselves and making enemies [[2girls1cup|vomit]] all over the place. However, they are [[Stupid|incredibly bad at PvP.]] Who knew?

*'''[[Noob|Paladins]]''' - Just like in ''World of Warcraft'': if you don't heal, people get pissed off, even if you state that [[Duh|the paladin is not a healer-type class]].

*'''[[Power Rangers|Rangers]]''' - A good-aligned class that wields a bow and arrows, and piss everyone else off because their arrows one-shot a monster from far away before anyone could get to it. Too bad, [[Slowpoke|slowpokes]].

*'''[[Black metal|Shadowknights]]''' - Now overpowered with ''[[Metroid|The Shadow Odyssey]]'' expansion, the Shadowknight is essentially an evil paladin that tortures and [[Team Fortress 2|saps the life out of people]]. Just like WoW's Death Knight, everyone plays one now.

*'''[[Pirate|Swashbucklers]]''' - Somehow, a pirate is aligned with the good guys. Swashbucklers are [[Gay|flamboyant]] and wield [[Penises|rapiers]]. Some of their attacks are even called "Flamboyant [[Buttsecks|Swathe]]".

*'''[[Christian|Templars]]''' - Holy men who beat people with [[Bible|Bibles]]. They make their enemies succumb to the power of Christ via [[Oxymoron|holy magic]] and heal people using the power of [[Jesus Christ|Mithaniel Marr]].

*'''[[Hannah Montana|Troubadours]]''' - Upbeat, happy bards that can somehow make people stronger with their ridiculous songs. They're not as gay as the Swashbucklers, but dammit, they're close.

*'''[[Otherkin|Wardens]]''' - Similar to the Fury, they use druid-like powers and can create obnoxious [[portals]]. They can cure you of your [[Internet disease]].

*'''[[Pagan|Warlocks]]''' - Often played by teenage boys, the Warlock can make people ill and turn them into frogs. They can also summon demons.

*'''[[Dungeons and Dragons|Wizards]]''' - See above, except this class does elemental damage, and summons [[cats]] instead. Yes, cats.

==Adventure Packs==

[[Image:Eq2_chinese_girl.jpg|thumb|right|lol [[azn]]]]

Adventure packs are like mini-expansions that cost like five bucks when they first released, but now come with the game. People bitched about the price and claimed that they were [[poor]] - which is retarded because if you could afford a computer that could even run EQ2, you're not poor.

===''[[Vampires|The Bloodline Chronicles]]''===
Nobody played or liked this one, and those who did were roleplayers and should be castrated immediately.

===''[[Vore|The Splitpaw Saga]]''===
Gnolls that threaten to eat you if you don't do five hour-long quests that involve lighting torches and [[Professional wrestling|fighting their pit champion]]. Hope you like the same drumming music over and over.

===''[[China|The Fallen Dynasty]]''===
Travel to Chinatown and defeat [[Snapesnogger|Nagas]]. Due to [[fucktarded|fucktardedness]], a lot of the characters have Japanese names.
{{clear}}
==Expansions==

[[Image:Barakah.jpg|thumb|left|[[Barack Obama]], one of the dragons you can fight in ''Desert of Flames''.]]

The expansions of ''EverQuest II'' are similar to the first game's: full of the most ridiculous [[fantasy]]-based crap and there's a [[Pokemon|lot of them]], especially considering that the game's only been around since [[2004]]. Like [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Sakurai]], SOE likes to do this weird balance/unbalance thing every time. The plots for each make less sense than [[WoW]]'s and prove that this game is made by drugged-up faggots from SoCal.

===''[[Arab|Desert of Flames]]''===
The first actual expansion, released right after [[9/11|September 11]], which is pretty hilarious considering the Arab-theme of it. There's even two adjacent oases called the Twin Tears.

===''[[Gorillaz|Kingdom of Sky]]''===
The second expansion involves floating islands ripped straight out of Gorillaz' "Feel Good, Inc." music video. People can travel across these islands from floating clouds to fight [[Cocks|vulture, dragon, and eagle men]] but the real lulz lies with the [[O RLY?|Hooluk]] race - a clan of owl men named after [[O RLY?|obvious memes]]. There is also a questline where a [[horny]] Hooluk asks if you have a [[Furry|manticore]] fetish, and suggests that the Overlord gets blown often by his sidekick. This expansion is the most popular because of its raid content, and since [[basement dweller]]s ''love'' raiding...

===''[[Twilight|Echoes of Faydwer]]''===
Much has changed since ''[[EverQuest]]''. [[Robots]] overtook the gnome city of Ak'[[anon]] and turned it into "Klak'anon", furries invaded the dwarf city Kaladim, and orcs terrorize the [[hippy]] wood elves in Kelethin. The Fae race was introduced, and everyone played as one for maybe two days before deleting the characters because no straight man would be caught playing as a glittery little [[faggot]]. One of the main villains is [[Anne Rice|Count Mayong Mistmoore]], a dark elf vampire with an inverted cross scar on his cheek, and you have to fight him [[twice]] for no reason whatsoever.

===''[[Africa|Rise of Kunark]]''===

[[Image:Voidbeast.jpg|thumb|right|An [[alien]] in EQ2. What the fuck?]]

The developers decided to take ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', replace everything with [[Nazi]] [[rape]] lizards and half-dragon-half-lizards, and put [[epic]] music composed by an [[Israeli]] in it. The results were unintentionally lulzy because the Sarnaks have the voices of [[Animu|10 year-old Japanese girls]]. The storyline involves the iksar going all [[holocaust]] on everyone while [[Hitler|Venril Sathir]] bitches at the [[dragons]] over the [[CP|Doomstone]], which, if obtained, will grant its holder unlimited power. Somehow, [[Battletoads]] are involved too, and Count Mayong Mistmoore comes back to let you know that he [[Osama|isn't dead yet]]. ''Rise of Kunark'' also introduces the Yha-lei, a race of [[Mudkip]] men that worship a giant [[penis]] monster that lives in boiling hot green shit. They also carry [[Boku|large pointy objects]] and chase you around screaming "IA IA IA IA IA IA". Strangely, this is not the weirdest that EQ2 ever gets. 90% of this expansion is solo content.

===''[[Drugs|The Shadow Odyssey]]''===
This expansion was supposed to suck, but surprised fans as they learned that it actually was like [[goth]] ''[[Metroid]]'' on [[crack]]. The "plot" got even [[moar]] fucked up because players basically become vampires, enter an African lich's phylactery (which is a school full of bongs,) and fly around hitting crab-aliens in space. This also came out in the same month as ''[[World of Warcraft|Wrath of the Lich King]]'' and ''[[Lord of the Rings|Mines of Moria]]''. Also, Mayong returns. Again.

===''[[Derp|Sentinel's Fate]]''===
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGKer2rDXZA Panda butts.] That is all.

===''[[Climategate|Destiny of Velious]]''===
The 2011 expansion, which will involve a lot of snow, and flying mounts. Due to the immense amount of illusions (i.e. you can appear to be a [[chair]]) and the fact that you can turn mount visibility off, prepare to fly around as a chair, log, 6 year-old Chinese girl, a rock, or a [[Turkish]] [[whore]], and so forth. All of these are actual illusions by the way.

==PVP==
<video type="youtube" id="amLWjmoWLuY" width="200" height="150" desc="Battlegrounds trailer: [[EQ2]] and [[UT2004]] TOGETHER." frame="true" position="right"/>
Player-verus-player, [[Obvious|or PVP for short]], was introduced in February 2006. The developers tacked it on because they were running out of ideas or something. It mostly involved running around the floating islands and failed attempts at [[parkour]]. Things were and still are unbalanced as shit, rendering some classes damn near useless. ''(See: the [[Necrophilia|necromancer]].)'' The largest server for this painful-to-play shit is [[Nagafen]], A.K.A. WoW's [[Asshole]]. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_LTj9AO_Vs Here is a typical PVP video, complete with shit music.] People run from each other and overall it is a gankfest of screaming [[wigger]]s trying to "[[Rape|HT]] the fuck out of your ass." (Scientists are still hard at work deciphering that code.) [[Lie|The Nagafen community loves everyone, especially new players, so come by and say hello anytime!]]

There's also Battlegrounds, which people claim was taken from WOW, but those people completely forget that WOW is essentially [[DAoC]] and [[EQ1]] combined. Battlegrounds feels like a weird hybrid of some [[FPS]] games and EQ2. <font size=3>INTENSE ACTION.</font>

==How to Troll ''EverQuest II''==

[[Image:Evergay.jpg|thumb|right|EQ2 is pretty [[gay]].]]
[[Image:Darkmiget_EQ2.PNG|thumb|right|The helpful community is always ready to lend a hand.]]

Ingame, and want to harvest some fresh lulz? Here's a handy guide.

*Download a trial account and play as a male Fae. Hit on every male character you see.

*Bitch about how similar or dissimilar EQ2 is to WoW, or its own prequel.

*Try to form up a raid to kill the Nagafen dragon (not the server, idiot).

*Run around the ''Desert of Flames'' expansion areas and make 9/11, Islam, or Iraq jokes.

*Play as a Jew or [[Battletoads|Froglok]] and hop around people. If Ratonga, give it a Jewish name, since they're basically Jewish anyway. If a Froglok, mention ''Battletoads'' as much as possible.

*Ask where the [[Murloc|Murlocs]] are at. Someone will direct you to the Yha-lei (fish-men) eventually.

*Put quotes from ''[[300]]'' in a /petition form and wait.

*If you play as an Enchanter class, charm a named NPC and run around with it. Extra lulzy if it's required for a quest.

*Obtain the goblin-throwing catapult, fireworks, turkey/cow launcher, or as many pets as possible, and run around a raid. This is even more fun if you're a druid, since you can open [[Portal|portals]] that instantly transport someone to the corresponding area upon clicking.

*Ask why the /pizza command no longer works.

*Tell people that Antonia Bayle isn't hot, and that her cosplayers are fat cows.

*Go to a PVP server, and start flaming the good/evil/exile side while pretending to be from one of the opposing factions.

There will be lulz. [[George Zimmer|I guarantee it.]]

==The Billy Doll==
[[Billy Mays|Billy]] is EQ2's [[Murloc]] - a lethal character that looks cute and cuddly but actually [[Duke Nukem 3D|wants to rip off your head and shit down your neck]]. He's an ingame [[meme]], and is required to kill for multiple instances (for example, a little [[Chinese]] girl plays "Pop! Goes the Weasel" on a jack-in-the-box, and guess [[Rape|what pops out]]!) He also appears in multiple haunted castles, watching you from far away, [[Dicking|ready to strike]]. It should also be noted, however, that Billy is incredibly [[unfunny]], as are anyone who uses the Billy [[Fursuit|illusion]] form, because only someone who thinks ''[[Invader Zim]]'' is the pinnacle of comedy would even find Billy remotely amusing.

<center>[[Image:Billy_julie.jpg|thumb|center|What a lucky doll.]]</center>

==Carotidcutter==
The Carotidcutter is a weapon which is linked to in the Nagafen levels 1-9 chat over and over. It's similar to [[WoW]]'s "[Dirge]" chat spam, except [Carotidcutter] is infinitely more annoying. Compare:

EQ2, being a MMORPG, has a lot of [[lame]] problems with it. Many of these issues are unnoticed for days (nevermind, YEARS) because the developers are either too busy taking immense amounts of [[acid]], loling at [[old meme]]s, or [http://forums.station.sony.com/eq2/posts/list.m?topic_id=428145&post_id=4770495 feeding on the tears of the banned, and Rise Krispie Treats].

===Station Launcher and Steam===

[[Image:Undying-back.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lie|Unlike WoW, EQ2 has realistic armor.]]]]

SOE finally found out that [[Steam]] was the [[Shit|way to go]] on downloading games over the internets. Unfortunately, they [[Doing it wrong|did it wrong]]. As the user finally downloads their copy of ''EverQuest II'' off of Steam, they click on it and become enraged. SOE forgot integrate the patches within Steam. Therefore, [[Shit|Station Launcher]] has to be used right after the application, ''EverQuest II'', is clicked on in Steam. The [[Shit|Station Launcher]] is supposed to "update" EQ2, but instead fails. It will either need administrative privileges on [[Vista|shitsta]] or it'll crap out on the user. Therefore, the user has to dick around with the updating process manually in order to get it to work since SOE will not do their jobs.

This creates a long, strenuous process of going through multiple folders to find out how to update the damn to game so it will actually start up. It's kind of like ''Where's [[Faggot|Waldo]]'', but 100 times more annoying.

Here are some quotes of the joy the users have when experiencing problems with this:

{{squote|So I just got this game on steam and downloaded it. It has the Rise of Kunak and the Shadow Oddysee. I am guesing I am suppose to use Shadow Oddysee, but when I try to play either it says game unavailable. Anyone know why? (When I clicked install I installed the Kunak one first, because I figured it was the one before, but it seemed to install both at the same time)|SOE hardly helped this person on their forums.}}

{{squote|Something like being able to PLAY the game you're paying for is a rather important detail.|[[RAGE]]}}

{{squote|<small>"The same thing happened to me. I bought the game through Steam but when I went to run it, it always said "game unavailable". I think there is something wrong with Steam's handling of the game.In order to work around this, I downloaded the EQ2 installer, unzipped/ran it and then copied over the files from my Steam directory into the new EQ2 directory created by the installer (make sure to copy the files over; you don't want to redownload everything!). Then I ran the launcher, it verified the files and I was off and running. All you're really buying from Steam is the license key. Once that is applied to your Station account, it doesn't matter where you get the client from or how you run it."</small>

Thanks, you are correct. [[Lie|I believe we have people working to make this process easier for customers so hopefully this wont be necessary for long.]]

(Maybe they'll correct the spelling on the name, as well)|A reply from SOE Support. They obviously lie about how much they are working on getting the game to work.}}

Another major problem is that Station Launcher, when downloaded off of the ''EverQuest II'' website, will take hours to install [[Shit|a few updates]]. 

The game installs itself fast and properly after it is downloaded by the user. Then, the user thinks that they can just play the game, but they are wrong. Instead of having fun, you have to download many patches before playing. When downloading the patches, there is an estimation time to show how long the patches will take to download and update the game. This estimation time will make the user [[rage]] due to it saying that the download will take four to five hours. So, the user waits until it's almost done and the timer goes [[WTF|BACK UP TO 4-5 HOURS]]. Finally, when the user has the game all patched up and ready to go, the game will either crash, glitch out, or plain old suck due to the Station Launcher's wonderful service.

===Uninstalling===

[[Image:Antonia_girls.jpg|thumb|left|HOT DAMN!]]

Uninstalling ''EverQuest II'' will probably be the best thing you could ever do for your computer. It's just not worth the 9-15 GB of space on your hard drive. (Of course, you deserve to be maimed for playing a [[MMORPG]] in the first place.) The problem is that [[Sony|SOE]] is an [[Google|evil corporation]] which does not want you to uninstall [[the game]]. It will not show up on the add/remove programs list on [[Windows]] therefore making your life harder. This has caused much drama over the Station forums and has made many people [[rage]]. You have to locate the "Sony" folder, delete the "EQ2" folder, "StationLauncher" folder, then remove the "Sony" folder in your Program Files to do this.

{{squote|Hey fellas, I went to try and uninstall eq2 the other day and it [[Wtf|doesn't show up anywhere in my add/remove programs box]]. I tried using crap cleaner to uninstall it and it doesn't show up there either. So I went to the program folder to look for the uninstall.exe and can't find one.

What the heck do I do now to get it off my PC. It's definitely on my HD because I can play the game.|The guy that posted this never had any help on uninstalling the game. Thanks SOE!}}

{{squote|I lent my pc to this woman once, she had 2 teenage boys who were into EQ, they loaded it on, I said it was OK but I'm not a gamer, this pc has been in storage for a few years and just got it out works fine still but still has EQ on it and I am not a gamer, have no use for this, it's taking up a lot of the memory. I went to the control panel and tried to remove it like remove all the other regular stuff but EQ took over my pc and started to set up. Please help? I just want to get rid of it. thanks.|Yeah, that [[whore]] fucked your [[Computer|system]] up really bad.}}

==Drama==

===Ceciliantas===

[[Image:Ceciliantas_personal_now.jpg|thumb|right|Ceciliantas tells us that [[Internet Tough Guy|it's personal now]].]]

One of the earliest bits of EQ2 drama was in December [[2004]], when a player named Ceciliantas was caught having [[cybersex]] with a girl in his ''[[Asking for it|unlocked player house]]''. A [[Gentlemen|scout used a stealth spell to hide himself from the cyberlovers]], and took hilarious screencaps of the event. It got so big, that [[Something Awful]] did a [http://www.somethingawful.com/d/weekend-web/eq2-cybersex-absolute.php Weekend Web] for it. Some of [[the best]] quotes include "''Be a man and tell us who you really are, so you will face my Justice."'' and ''"I take Aggro tanking very seriously, I played nothing but a Paladin for 5 years.''" (Too bad that many of the paladins in the game's lore are [[virgins|celibates]]!) The whole thing can be found [http://www.thedauntless.com/cecil.html here]. Everyone involved has quit the game out of shame.

===[[EQ2Flames]]===

[[Image:Matin_shitfit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Typical]] intelligence of an EQ2Flamer.]]

[http://www.eq2flames.com/ EQ2Flames] is probably the biggest hellhole of EQ2 drama to exist. From developers giving out strats to guilds, transferring characters off of beta-test servers onto main ones, to LFG, the admin, suddenly getting a newfound faith in [[Jesus]] and dumping his previous life of doing a truckload of [[meth]]. There's even more too, including WoW fanboys being constantly trolled, [[User:JimBastard|people wanting to try to take ED and EQ2Flames down]], someone setting fire to themselves for a suicide attempt, wives fucking guildmates at cons, and even [[Ddos|DDOSing]]. Now, how the fuck could meth, cheating, Jesus, an failed hero by fire, ED, EQ2, and more shit mix together? '''[[EQ2Flames|(Only at EQ2Flames...)]]'''

===Station Cash===

[[Image:Smedley's_backyard.jpg|thumb|right|The result of Smedley pissing off EQ2Flames.]]

To [[troll]] EQ1+2 fans once again, [[SOE]] has decided to release [http://www.eq2flames.com/general-gameplay/37296-station-cash.html Station Cash in December 2008] - by purchasing a special ingame currency with IRL [[money]], you can obtain several exclusive items. [[Maple Story|Sound]] [[Gaia Online|familiar]]? [[Jewish|Why SOE would do something like that is beyond me]], but they haven't thought things through. [http://www.thegrouchygamer.com/?p=157#more-157 (Blizzard also seems to be going down this path!)] As you can see in the thread linked earlier, only three [[Fags|people]] like it. Even on the official forums, people have [[Flounce|threatening to close accounts (again)]]  as seen [http://forums.station.sony.com/eq2/posts/list.m?start=150&topic_id=438341 here]. What really pissed off players was that Smedley's definition of RMT (real money transactions) differs from the rest of the world's, [http://forums.station.sony.com/eq2/posts/list.m?start=50&topic_id=438336 as seen in this thread]. Smedley, in reaction, lol'd, and went to go get more toupees.
