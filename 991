Bitch I look like Goku
<center><youtube>fqHkyD32TeY</youtube></center>

A [[weaboo]]ish line from a rap song that made every [[animu]] and [[Dragonball Z]] fans butthurt. The line itself came from the legendary hip-hop troll, [[Soulja Boy]]. Somewhere in his [[dumbass]] mind, he thought it was a good idea to come out of the closet and show the whole world he was a major weaboo. Claiming to look like Goku.

==Origin==
[[Know Your Meme]] claims that the meme started in a specific forum thread, as the retarded [[retards]] they are, they were false. The meme actually orignated around July when Soulja Boy thought, "Why not make a freestyle about anime and bitches?" Keeping those thoughts in his [[double nigger|brainless]] mind eventually motivated his to drive to the studio while smoking 500 pounds of weed to record a song about "Anime" and the character "Goku". In the anime song, he repetitively used the word "ANIME ANIME ANIME" while referencing some of the most common anime shows, and Case Closed. In the goku song, he basically combined the 2 elements from the "Anime" song and said, "Bitch, I look like <Insert DBZ character here>".

==The Reaction==

As soon as Soulja Boy put this song on one of his millions of useless youtube accounts. It began to create a huge uproar around the [[interwebs]]. For [[wiggers]] it was just another reason to hate Soulja Boy. For [[weaboo|hardcore anime fans]], it was the end of life for anime. They swarmed the video [[BAW|QQing and posting death threats]]. Soulja Boy ignored it as usual and sent to the people who actually liked his song a emoticon or the word "swag". What could be more embarassing is the "rapper" had more skeletons in his closet as it was known that he had a [[deviantart]] account. From there, he forced his fans to make him a manga, which they did. But just like every scandal that happens on deviantart, it ended up with every member flaming him and a cause for him to close his account. Weaboos thought they was doing the [[rap]] community a favor by exploiting this and ending his careeer, but they actually done the vice versa. Some dragonballs fans actually liked it, and it couldn't touch his career due to too many wiggers loving that Pretty Boy Swag song.
