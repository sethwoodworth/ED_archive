Imeem
[[Image:ZipZapRap.jpg|thumb|Typical "[[Crap|artists]]" you will see on the main page.]]

'''Imeem''' was a failure of a social media website which allowed [[Noobs|users]] to upload music and videos that suck ass. Most of the music that was uploaded and featured was [[Crap|rap]] and [[Emo|emo]] [[Fail|music]] that requires no talent to make. Moreover, the videos that were posted did not even stream half of the time. The ones that did stream were [[Offended|incredibly horrid]] in their own unique ways. The userpages that were made by the users of the website were [[Fail|horrible]] considering the fact that you could only move around boxes (just like [[Failbook|Facebook]] [[Amirite|amirite]]?) and change the background colors and theme of the webpage. [[Some argue|Some users believed]] that '''paying''' to have a [[Lol wut|premium account]] was worth it and actually made them [[USI|better than you]]. This was incredibly not true due to the fact that all a premium account did was allow the [[Retard|user]] to see the [[Shit nobody cares about|stupid statistics of how many people went to your page]]; It also added more themes for your profile which [[Shit nobody cares about|no one cared about]]. One who actually cared about this stuff was full of fail and deserves to become [[An Hero|an hero]].

==30 Second Previews==
Around early 2007, Imeem had a [[Raped|lawsuit filed against them]] by the [[The Man|RIAA]]. The creators went [[Insane|batshit insane]] making all of the songs 30 second previews. This decision made all of the users [[Butthurt|butthurt]] causing half of them to [[An Hero|leave]] while the rest of the [[Pussies|users]] bitched. Later on though, Imeem enabled some songs to be full songs instead of being [[Jews|jews]] and making all of the songs 30 second previews to [[Buttsecks|cover their asses]]. Still, people [[Baw|bitched]] about this by making groups and petitions (which never work '''EVER''').

==Spam==
People think that [[Fucktard|spamming chain spam messages really helps them]], but it does not and they [[Fail|fail]] at life.

'''Typical spam message on Imeem:'''<br/>

==Mailbox==
The mailbox is one of the most [[Raped|exploited]] features on Imeem. Many of the the messages that a use may get are either [[Spam|chain mails or shared music/playlists]]. Only [[lol cow|obnoxious people]] do this to make themselves [[USI|feel more important than you]]. When one responds to the the sender, usually the sender will ask who are or say a little speech about how you should not talk to [[Retard|them]].

== imeem Sellout ==
On [[Last Thursday|December 9, 2009]], Dalton Caldwell, owner of imeem, sold his website itself out to [[MySpace]] for less than $1,000,000 to become [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s bitch. It currently is being [[rape|raped]] by Tom as MySpace Music and didn't tell [[You|anyone]] about it.

Upon this [[Lulz|transaction]], the imeem [[iPod|app]] immediately [[unemployed|stopped working]] for [[over 9000]] [[13 year old boys]] and [[16 year old girls]].
