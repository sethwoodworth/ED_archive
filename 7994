TV.com , till [[2005]] known as TV Tome, is a part of one shitty [[community]] of [[retard|retards]] using the same CNET webcode as the horrifying [[Gamespot]] or [[GameFAQs]], and [[masturbating]] over television characters. [[Lie|Not a Stalinist website that persecutes members]].


==The Community==

TV.com, basing their structure on their heroes, the [[Nazi|Nazis]], have attempted to create the First Internet Reich:
*Admins and Moderators- spawns of [[Adolf Hitler]].
*Editors- guys who were studying the works of [[Josef Mengele]], but instead of editing [[Jews]], they edit the work of other people and claim it as their own.
*Trusted Users- guys who suck Editors' [[cock|cocks]] and are fucked in the [[ass]], just to be better than those puny, tiny, [[Nobody]] users. This makes them similar to [[Nazi|SS]] soldiers. 
*Users- [[idiot|idiots]] still hoping that they will contribute something useful to the community, and are [[fuck|skullfucked]] by Editors and ridiculed by Trusted Users, because they are simple underlings. That makes them all [[Jews|jewish]].

==Forums==

Forums on TV.com are swarmed by [[13-year-old boy|13-year-old boys]] and [[16-year-old girl|16-year-old girls]], who write [[fanfiction]], love [[Furries]] and lick each others balls. Any [[Troll|constructive critique]] makes them call for a [[lawyer]], piss their pants and whine to [[Your Mom|their moms]] about how this is such cruel world we live in. Many [[clique|cliques]] and [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Category:Subcultures subcultures], like [[Emo|Emo Kids]], junior [[Goths]] and teenage rebels, occupy and terrorize forum pages of shows they love, like rival gangs in an electronic city. For example: Old farts like Captain Planet, [[Emo|Emos]] would die for Full House, and [[Azn|Azns]] [[masturbation|fap]] when they see [[Teen Titans]].


Beside forums dedicated for specific shows, there are also the so-called ''General Forums'', which include:
* TV.com Ideas- where Admins get a [[blowjob]] each week from every single editor and trusted user.
* Welcome New Users- Where [[Jews]] say their last words before being cremated by Editors.
* User to User Help: Hints and Tips- Where older [[Jews]] fuck younger [[Jews]].
* TV.com General User Support- Where Editors lure [[Jews]] to go into the showers.
* TV.com User Submission Support- Where, as the name states, [[Jews]] are tied up and used as [[Gimp|gimps]].
* About the Forums (Ask the Mods)- Here moderators answer every question with a [[catchphrase]], mostly saying [[Drama|I know this, but I won't tell, because it's the site's secret]]. 
* TV.com Technical Support Board- Where everyone can learn what's fucked up with the site's code, and why nothing works properly. There's never any answer about bugs being fixed.
* General TV Discussion- Forum for dumb fucks who can't decide which show is their favorite, so they discuss ALL of them.
* Off-Topic- As anyone can predict, that's the place where teenagers without the right to vote discuss politics, [[virgin|virgins]] tell about their [[sex]] life and [[fat|fatties]] cry about how [[fugly]] they are to create some [[drama]].
* Shows in Development- Forum about shows which will never be finished.
* TV Show Fun & Games- Where [[community]] users describe their [[sex]] experiences and what fun and games you can have in bed. Noted as most popular among [[Simpsons]] [[fanboy|fans]] is pissing, while the [[anime]] [[fandom]] sticks to the traditional Asian game of [[bukkake]].
* [[Drama]]- Do I have to say more? 
* Comedy- That's where they call Dharma & Greg and Full House "comedy", which is obvious proof for lack of trustworthy information on TV.com
* Science-Fiction- Ideal place for [[Nerd|nerds]], [[Geek|geeks]] and other [[Star Trek|trekkies]].
* Reality- Brainwashing thread, where everybody says that cop shows and Jerry Springer are for real.
* Animation- The home of [[Basement-dweller|basement dwellers]] who get a boner seeing Kim Possible and, of course, [[Otaku|Otakus]]
* Soaps- Ironically, it's a forum for those who don't use it.
* News/Documentary- very similar to ''Off-Topic'', swarmed by same users LOL I GUESS THIS IS WHY THEY CALL IT RANDOM
* Talk Shows- If [[you]] have to know how [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah's]] shit tastes like, this is the forum for you.
* Children- Ideal for [[Pedophile|pedos]] lurking for their new best 5-year-old friends.
* Sports- Where [[fat|plumpies]] act like olympic champions.
* Ask the Editors- Ask them when it's your turn to give them [[blowjob|pleasure]], maybe you'll get the ''Trusted'' prefix.
* Editor's Lounge- If you ever wondered where and how Editors relax, this is the place. If you enter, be prepared to have your asshole in [[goatse]] style. 
* Television Hardware- read: "Why HDTV is overrated".
* Downloading Television- Or, as people call it on the [[internets]]: Where can I find a torrent for the new season of [[Lost]]?

==CBS==

[[Last_Thursday | Last Thursday]], Tv.com [[Whore | was sold]] for some money. [[Evil | CBS]] raped the design to blind everyone that uses the site, [[I_did_it_for_the_lulz | just for the lulz]]. In response, users gave CBS the finger.
