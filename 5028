Luring
'''Luring''' is a tactic used by trolls and assholes on many a MMORPG. It's a multi-step process:

#Scammer befriends a naive [[newbie]];
#Scammer either lures the newbie into an area populated by many dangerous monsters, or into an area where player-killing is allowed;
#Newbie gets owned, scammer lols and takes any loot dropped;
#[[IDIFTL|Laughs are had all round, and another pint of booze is ordered]];

[[Pedophiles]] use a very similar tactic with children:

#Pedo befriends a naive child;
#Pedo either lures the newbie into an area where they are alone, or into [[anontalk.com|an area where the pedo can kidnap them]];
#Child gets a sexual experience they can brag about to all the virgins in their school, pedo lols and takes any innocence dropped;
#[[IDIFTL|Child grows up to be either gay or a stripper]];
