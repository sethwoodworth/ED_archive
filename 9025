WikiFUD
{{needsmoar|examples and PICTURES}}

'''WikiFUD''' is the act of introducing [[FUD|fear, uncertainty, and doubt]] into the maintainers of [[serious]] [[Wikipedia]] articles. ie Fuck You Dumbasses. It involves identifying hard-to-prove but reasonable statements and requesting verification for them via in-line templates like <code><nowiki>{{fact}}</nowiki></code> or <code><nowiki>{{who}}</nowiki></code>, or article tags like <code><nowiki>{{unreferenced}}</nowiki></code>. The more difficult, embarrassing, or distressing it would be to provide a reliable source, the better your WikiFUD is. And remember, you have two audiences: the [[wikipedophile]]s who view this article as their personal property, preening over its quality and jealously guarding against obvious attempts to vandalize it, and those who actually read Wikipedia articles because they want to learn stuff.

==Good targets for WikiFUD==
Not all topics are conducive to WikFUD. Good choices for WikiFUD-style vandalism are those that already generate a substantial amount of criticism and controversy, with the ideal choice being a controversial subject with little popular appeal. This increases the likelihood that a call for verifiability and reliable sources will be thought to be coming from another expert in the field and the chance your WikiFUD will be taken seriously. Some good places to start:
*articles on classic literature that [[noone]] reads except [[16 year old girls|high school students]] and intellectuals
*fields of knowledge that mostly involve making stuff up, like [[philosophy]]
*articles for [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|important, yet obscure websites with no acceptable references]]
*uncited facts that no reasonable person would find an issue with, yet involve knowledge that cannot easily be verified
*non-expert stubs (like [[anime]]) that [[noone]] is likely to maintain -- '''DO NOT''' tag the whole article (as that could be seen as a precursor to putting it up for deletion), only tag random sentences [[shit nobody cares about|that are as unimportant and trivial as the rest of the article yet ''seem'' like they could be controversial to anyone crazy enough to care about the subject enough to read it in the first place]].

The overarching goal with WikiFUD is to vandalize without being reverted, and to do it in a [[lulz]]-inducing manner. Unaddressed WikiFUD should cause lulz in perceptive readers of the article. Attempts to address WikiFUD should cause lulz-worthy behavior by the maintainer(s) of that article, although this behavior has not, to date, been directly observed.

==Why WikiFUD?==
Wikipedia's imperfect standardization of rules and guidelines causes misunderstandings and errors by [[Bureaucratic_Fuck|sheep who don't know to understand the intent of the guidelines]] and allows malicious behavior by [[MONGO|those with an outside agenda]]<sup><span style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;''[[Citation needed|verification needed]]''&#93;</span></sup>. This has led to inaccuracies and omissions in the content of the largest [[Wiki]] of the whole [[Internets]], which continue to this day. It is no less than our duty to expand on and propagate the errors in [[politics|this broken system]], so that all may know the [[Emo|pain]] and [[Livejournal|suffering]] we have known.
