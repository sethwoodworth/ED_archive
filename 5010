Once a vast and trusted source of e-news on the [[internets]], the LNN provided news coverage of all major world news events, often scooping stories before CNN, [[Fox News]] and [[Throwingstardna]]. LNN had many correspondents including [[jameth]], [[Lol (lj user)|lol]] and [[hepkitten]], though they are now all [[Death#E-Death|e-dead]].

Originally hosted on [[LiveJournal]], LNN secured independent hosting shortly before entering internet limbo. The move occurred on December 1st, 2004 after harassment by the [[LJ Abuse|LJ Abuse Team]] regarding possible violations of the [[DMCA]].
