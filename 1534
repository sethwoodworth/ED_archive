===Male Lesbianism===
{{quote|I am a [[fag|"gaaaaaaaaaybian"]], a male-lesbian.|Chris-chan reveals his true sexuality.}}

On February 5th, Chris-chan very intelligently decided to upload a video stating that he is, in fact, gay, [[retard|(maybe hoping this would shut our mouths up)]] and of course the users responded very enthusiastically. Just after he noticed the amount of lulz his new video was producing, he decided to delete it. However a good fellow reupload it for great justice. Note how he says he [[lie|respects]] the [[Homosexuality|"gay population"]], even though he's said gay people were bad, sinful, deserve to die in an explosion, and going straight to HELL! (God help him)

===IT WAS A TRAP!!!===
He has now decided to jump back into the closet. He apparently came out because Clyde made an obvious fake death threat on one of his dearest gal-pals that only a retarded person would believe - this means that if someone else makes such a threat, they can get Chris to do another video!

If you skip to 1:23, you can see him strugglin' to break his last piece of evidence: a fucking BUTT-DILDO. He also states how he has to look at a poster of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' daily or he'll turn gay. Further evidence that Chris struggles to maintain his heterosexuality on a daily basis. But the whole premise of Chris enjoying ''Sailor Moon'' is highly ironic considering the show is renowned for having homosexuals, lesbians, and transsexual characters. Unfortunately for him, [[truth|once you're out, you can't go back in]].
