'''Tegan and Sara Quin''' are [[Incest|identical]] [[lesbian]] twins from [[Canada]] who sing in the indie-pop duo called ''Tegan and Sara''. Tegan and Sara have toured extensively, sampling [[Cunt|vaginal]] [[Cum|fluid]] from [[Australia]] to [[France]]. Tegan and Sara have a huge fan base amongst angsty teenage [[Gay|bi-sexual]] [[Emo|emos]], which yields a juicy [[Troll|trolling]] crop.

Born in [[Canadia|Canada]], Tegan and Sara loved two things from a young age: [[Hipster|indie]] music and [[pussy]]. Whilst still in [[School|High School]] they started a failure of a band called ''PLUNK'', named after the sound a double ended [[dildo]] makes when it is plunged into two identical twin sisters, which failed to have a bassist or a drummer. Regardless of this setback, they managed to record 3 demo albums at their Canadian school.  Their albums were [[Lie|totally not a bunch of Weezer rip-offs]], despite them being named ''Red Album'' and ''Yellow Album'' and so-forth. It is believed that Tegan and Sara were planning to announce their [[Homosexual|homosexuality]] by creating a myriad of shit indie in all the colors of the fag [[rainbow]].

Tegan and Sara proved that they are [[women]] and will suck a cock to get what they want. They went [[Not gay|straight]] for Neil Young and got signed. They started touring and recorded 5 albums of whingy, [[lesbian]], [[hipster]] crap with the help of [[Emo|Death Cab for Cutie, Weezer and AFI members]].

So blame them.

== Lesbians ==

Tegan and Sara are [[Gay|gay]].

{{quote|[[Fap|Listen]] to the interview with [[Lesbian|Tegan]] below. She talks about [[What|Lilith Fair]], the lack of women on the [[Kitchen|charts]], “tampon rock,” [[homophobia]], [[porn]] and how people think [[Fact|she makes out with her twin in her spare time]]. In short, it’s a pretty [[awesome]] interview.|[http://theindiefiles.wordpress.com/2009/10/06/indie-ladies-who-lunch-tegan-and-sara-edition/ Ladies Who Lunch blog]}}

Tegan and Sara's parents have won the sexuality lottery. Whilst the prevalence of male homosexuality is 10.3% of the population, the prevalence of [[Chris-Chan|true and honest]] homosexuality amongst women is a mere 7.7%. So not only are Tegan and Sara identical twins, of which only 4 per 1000 births in the [[USA]] are, they both also fall within the slim 7.7% of women who are exclusively homosexual. This leads one to think of their parents as some sort of [[faggot]] cloning device, which is a fair assumption.

Tegan and Sara have also gained an honorable mention on the [[Gay|fabulous]] website [http://www.lovegodsway.org/GayBands LoveGodsWay], being referenced in a list of ''Faggot Music''. 

{{quote|There are multiple levels of Gay Music.  Some bands are what we like to call '''Gateway Bands'''.  They lure children in with Pop Grooves and Salacious Melodies leaving them wanting more.  They’ll move on to more dangerous bands and the next thing you know you’ve got a homosexual for a child.
We’ve taken the time to highlight the bands that are particularly Gay.  Please take the time and dissect your child’s CD / iTunes catalog. If you find 3 or more of these bands in their collection it is time to take action.

'''We Strongly recommend that you burn the CDs.'''  Make sure your child is watching.  Make sure they can feel the heat. It is crucial that the image remains emblazoned in their young minds. They need to know that if they continue to listen to these bands they may Burn eternally as well.|[http://www.lovegodsway.org/GayBands LoveGodsWay]}}

====Twitter and Prop 8====

Tegan and Sara are known [[Twitter|twitfags]], posting [[b/|random bullshit]] about [[faggotry]] that no one but [[Emo|angsty teenage bi-curious]] [[Hipster|hipsters]] care about. Doing so has landed them on a list of the hottest lesbians to follow! Along with [[Fag|Ellen DeGeneres, Kate Clinton and Rachel Maddow]], they join a [[Gay|prestigious]] list of bulldykes whom collectively clog the [[Internet|tubes]] with their [[Period|menstruation]] fueled gay [[Rape|agenda]].

Tegan and Sara, although both living in [[Canada|Canadia]], were in [[California]] when Prop 8, which would have legalized [[gay]] marriage was [[Justice|over-turned]]. Unfortunately for them, Prop 8 does not legalize the marriage between gay, fisting, lesbian sisters. 

== Camwhores ==

Tegan and Sara are no strangers to the limelight, having appeared on ''Letterman, Leno, Conan O'Brian'' and other talk shows numerous times. Not to mention their music making appearances on TV shows such as ''Grey's Anatomy, Being Erica, The Hills, What's New Scooby Doo, Ghost Whisperer, The L Word, Veronica Mars and One Tree Hill.'' 

This is just another smoking gun proving the involvement of the [[Jews]] forcing the [[Gay]] agenda down the throats of good, hardworking white [[Americans]], [[Australians]] and their [[England|retarded cousins]].
