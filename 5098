== Welcome to America ==
While trolling a campaign appearance by Virginia Senator [[George Allen]] in the name of his fearless leader [[Che Guevara]], terrorisor Shekar Sidarth experienced a vicious reverse-troll in which Allen called him out on his racial handicap. [[Butthurt|Emotionally scarred]] by the incident, Sidarth engaged a [[Pokemon|super-effective]] [[1337]] counter reverse-troll by posting Allen's comments on [[YouTube]] becoming salon.com's [http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/12/16/sidarth/ Person of the Year] in the process. 

'''From Macaca's Eyes'''

[[Some argue]] that Sidarth just took advantage of Allen's epic [[ruination|self-ruination]].

== What is a Macaca? ==
The truth is, in fact, that nobody actually knows what George Allen meant by "Macaca" since it is not actually a word or racial epithet as much as Allen just being a [[fucktard]]. While the [[Daily Kos]] and the rest of the [[liberal]] [[blogosphere]] was abuzz after the incident with cries of "[[zOMG]] [[racism|RACISM]]", the fact is that if Allen wanted to be truly racist, he would've called Sidarth out as the [[terrorist|towelheaded]] [[Indian|camel jockey]] [[arab|sand nigger]] that he is. 

== Fallout ==
George Allen's campaign totally [[jumped the shark]] after the incident and it gave Jim Webb, a [[batshit]] [[NRA]] and [[Reagan]] [[fanboi]] who wrote lulzy books about whorefucking a fighting chance to win the election against the incumbent. As it turns out, Allen is a [[rich and beautiful|rich]] half Jew, so he probably got confused and thought he was running for Senator in [[Maryland]] where a sekrit Jew cabal could have secured his election instead of [[Virginia]] which is completely filled with [[white|crackers]].
