Steve Ostrowski
[[Image:Steve-o is watching you.jpg|thumb|He's watching you.]]
'''Steve Ostrowski''' is a student at the University of [[California]], Davis.  Despite the fact that he's a senior, he has never been kissed because of the fact that he is creepy as fuck.  He considers himself to be some sort of political operative for [[conservative]] justice, despite the fact that his theories are more half-baked than [[Rush Limbaugh]] on Oxycontin.

Steven loves to give himself titles.  At various times, he has called himself:

= The Radio Show =

SteveO currently has a show on KDVS-FM radio, where he pretends to be a liberal under the name DJ Steve Empire. "The Empire Nation" is exactly like the Colbert Nation, except completely unfunny. If you listen closely in the silent spots, you can occasionally hear a [[nigra]] in the background eating fried chicken while ass raping Steve-O with 11 inches of pure pain. Apparently, Jesus didn't tell him that 2 minutes of dead air is a bad thing on the radio.

If you have nothing [[An hero|better]] to do, you can listen to a podcast of his show here:  http://169.237.101.62/archives/KDVS%20Public%20Affairs%20-%20Special%20Programming%20%28Thu%20Jun%2028,%202007,%20128kbps%29.mp3

According to the um, Davis Wiki page, he, um, recorded it rather than going live, so that, um, it would be, um, [[lie|perfect]]. Shockingly, Ostrowski is made of fail.

= The Wiki Phenom =

SteveO has made it to be the ninth ranked editor on Davis Wiki, with about 10% of edits to further his political plans, 65% reverting back to those edits, 10% creepy new titles for himself on his vanity pages, and 10% pure retardation.  Note: he's a few percent short of a pie chart.

He insists on enforcing NPOV on a non-NPOV wiki.  However, the mods refuse to ban him -- the only ban they've issued is for a complete asstard, [[Madrigalskylark]].  His reply to this: ''"The Davis Wiki is currently having a pointless debate over my account. They will give me terms to which I may or may not agree with, and then I will go ahead and post what I believe to be factual information anyway."'' (from his [http://sostrowski.livejournal.com/24077.html eljay])

On the upside, having him around the Davis Wiki inspires lulzy edits like [http://daviswiki.org/Users/SteveOstrowski?action=recall&version=240 this one].

Since his father was a cop and the internet is [[Serious Fucking Business|serious fucking business]], he has tried his hand at being an [[internet detective]]. Despite being told [[over 9000|many times]] that internet geolocation services suck on a local scale, he still continues to believe that you're editing from Sacramento, not Davis you [[moron|moran]].

= The Catholic Crusaders = 

During the summer of 2005, probably due to a combination of boredom and unemployment, Steve formed a [[Anti-lulz|lulzkilling]] group on [[MySpace]] known as the "[[Catholic]] Crusaders" ...[[for great justice]] Their mission was to harass [[Tom]] to remove all "morally offensive" [[shit]] on Myspace, such as [[pr0n|n00ds]], [[Racist|racism]], [[lesbian|shaved lesbian pussy]], and [[Atheist|anything]] [[shitting dick nipples|else]] the [[Catholic]] church wouldn't approve of. Of course, that means the [[12chan|pedos]] got off scot free. Various atheist, [[gay]], and [[pagan]] groups fought back and much [[drama]] ensued.

= The Pyramid Scheme =

At one point in 2007, Ostrowski decided to try his hand in business.  His ingenious plan?  Get other people to sell cellular phones for him under the Sacramento Global Corp.  According to his [http://sostrowski.livejournal.com/24077.html eljay]:  ''"I will employ students to spread this business and then within a sort time dominate the student market. These employees at the same time will make it their business to interact with ASUCD and then finally there will be a full CDP slate numbering beyond 6 candidates in November."''  I WILL DOMINATE THE STUDENT GOVERNMENT THROUGH CELLULAR PHONES MUHAHAHA[[oneoneone|!!111!1!!]]

Using the [[wikiality]] clause, the business was promptly created after being posted to Davis Wiki.  However, after being [http://daviswiki.org/Sacramento_Global?action=recall&version=48 called out] by the local wikizens for not filing for a fictitious business name, the page was [http://daviswiki.org/Sacramento_Global?action=info unceremoniously] deleted.

= Student Government =

One day, Steven Ostrowski was sitting [[in the pooper|on the toilet]], when he received a revelation from [[Jesus]], as he calls the voice in his head, who told him that he had a destiny:  to [[Christian|Christianize]] the student government.  To these ends, he established a new political party to oppose the establishment Greeks and [[Nigra|ethnic]] interests in the local student government, ASUCD:  '''The Christian Slate'''.  Adopting the flag of [[Catholic|Vatican City]] and a pledge of allegiance (the Lord's Prayer), and a [[Facebook]] group, Steve was ready to do some [[shit nobody cares about|student government politics]]!

Steve railed against the student government for its stance on [[shitcock|religious]] issues. Steve was also divinely inspired to write a bill requiring the Pledge of Allegiance be spoken every week. Despite the fact that he introduced this [[at least 100]] times, the bill has been killed every single time for great justice.  He threatened:

 You have also slimmed your chances of getting hired by any non-governmental
 organization or business that would take issue with your vote. All companies
 do background checks, as I'm sure you are well aware.

The Christian Slate inspired the [[JEWS DID WTC|Jewish Slate]], which promised goals such as [http://daviswiki.org/ASUCD_Jewish_Slate stopping the sale of pork on campus, and securing the Davis/Woodland border].

Eventually, the Christian Slate was renamed as the '''Christian Democratic Party''' because [[Over 9000|a lot]] of people told him that being centered on Christianity isn't the way to get elected on a college campus in California.  He promptly shooped the Albanian flag for the party this time.

In a massive lapse in judgment, SteveO was hired by the student government -- by a 7-6 vote and fired two weeks later by a unanimous vote-- after he had tried to ''blackmail'' the recorder.  Even the campus newspaper [http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2007/01/30/Opinion/Editorial.Asucd.Blackmail-2686166.shtml jumped] [http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2007/01/29/CampusNews/Asucd.Commissioner.Sends.EMail.Offering.To.Privately.Negotiate.Court.Case-2682681.shtml in] on the lulz. While ASUCD has weathered it's share of [[Daviswiki Deepthroat / Fingercuffs Incident|controversy]], it seems that this time luck just wasn't with Sith Lord Steve.

The most lulzy thing he tried to do is bring a cameraman, paid for by the [http://www.leadershipinstitute.org/ Leadership Institute] (a conservative [[Creationism|think]] tank that wants to pwn your student government lol), to film a meeting. The ASUCD Controller came out with his angry [[Fifty Hitler Post|German]] voice, and the video was posted on [[YouTube]].  As you can imagine, this expose rocked [[Your mom|the nation]].

"As for the Truth only I know the Truth." -Steve Ostrowski [http://daviswiki.org/Church_of_the_Divide?action=diff&version2=73&version1=72]

"The Court Case will be dropped if you allow me to assist you with the Senate minutes. Knowledge of these edits would be between you and me and no one else, because I donâ€™t want people in ASUCD to think less of you, and think that I am trying to manipulate the minutes." -Steve Ostrowski [http://www.inoculatedmind.com/?p=152]

"The M16 rifle used in some police departments is much safer than a typical pistol especially in urban areas because the rifle bullet explodes upon impact where is a pistol bullet goes through the target and then blasts through several walls before it stops." -Steve Ostrowski, displaying his masterful knowledge of ballistics. [http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Police_Department?action=diff&version2=126&version1=125] (Hint: The bullet can fragment, it doesn't explode.)

== Quotes about Ostrowski ==

"I think the problem is that you don't really post factual information. Or at least the fact/vague rumor ratio is much less than 1. Oh, and that you're an asshat and deserve to die." -- Brent Laabs on Davis Wiki [http://daviswiki.org/Ban_Steven_Ostrowski?action=diff&version2=95&version1=94]

"I, George Andrews, endorse a ban. He is an embarrassment to the conservative cause and has made a mockery of the years of good will that DCR [Davis College Republicans] built with the ASUCD/UC Davis community in mending fences." -- [http://daviswiki.org/Ban_Steven_Ostrowski?action=recall&version=162] George Andrews, Executive Director, Orange County Republican Party ([http://daviswiki.org/George_Andrews Andrews on the Daily Show: lulz])
