He touted himself as a tenured professor with doctorates in theology and canon law.

But the volunteer editor and fact checker for the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia turned out to be a 24-year-old dropout from Centre College and Lexington Community College.

In a long feature last July, The New Yorker described how Ryan Jordan&mdash;identified online and in the magazine article as Essjay&mdash;was renowned for rooting out errors and obscenity from Wikipedia, whose entries are contributed and corrected by readers and volunteer editors.

Last week, however, after Jordan's credentials were exposed as fictitious, the magazine ran a correction&mdash;and yesterday Jordan, who had written or edited about 16,000 entries, resigned.

Wikipedia has said no questions have been raised about the accuracy of his work.

Critics of Wikipedia said the deception was fitting, given the site's history of errors that include reporting that the prime minister of Norway was a pedophile.

Devoted contributors, including Louisville computer programmer Steve Magruder, who has written many entries about the city, said they feared Essjay's deceptions could damage the encyclopedia's credibility. 

Another Wikipedian, as they call themselves, denounced Jordan last week on the site, saying: "I hope you understand how you are ... all over the thousands of people who have made a real effort to turn Wikipedia into a credible source."

Responding on his Wikipedia page, Jordan initially defended his deceptions by saying he had to protect himself from online stalkers. He told The New Yorker he routinely got death threats from people he banned from the site.

Wikipedia's co-founder, Jimmy Wales, also said at first on the site that he had no problem with Jordan's invented persona.

But yesterday, Wales asked for Jordan's resignation.|Excerpt from article on Essjay, Kentucky Courier Journal|color=red|size=200%}}
