<b>''Tabula Rasa''</b> (Which translates to [[Moonspeak|"Blank Slate"]]. Fitting, since all the fags who bought this game are going to have to start over on something [[RuneScape|new]].) was another shitty game created by Richard Garriott which has a storyline that makes no sense at all. Unlike other MMORPGs, this one had [[Lie|real-time action]] enabling the player to move around and go [[Insane|batshit insane]] on the enemies that he or she was attacking. This [[Lol wut|super, awesome, action-packed experience]] made the player [[Butthurt|annoyed]] after a while due to the [[LSD|confusion]] of what is actually happening around them. Throughout the game, the only ways to level were to either collect logos (which is boring as hell), do instances that no one ever did, or play with yourself in bases in order to [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|stop]] the evil [[Tentacle rape|tentacle monsters]] from taking over bases. The sad part is that after the player levels past level 30, there is no point in playing the game at all. Why would [[Noob|someone]] play this [[Shit|game]] in the first place though?<br>

These activities were repetitive and made the player want to become [[an hero]] after a while. [[Some argue|Many believe]] that the new [[Masturbation|playstyle]] of ''Tabula Rasa'' may influence other MMORPGs, but they [[Nobody gives a shit|do not give a shit]]. Just like every MMORPG, it was full of [[Retard|retards]] and [[basement dwellers]] that do absolutely nothing with their lives.

{{quote|[[Discrimination|Ethical and moral dilemmas]] are something we definitely wanted to incorporate into the [[Shit|design]] of <i>Tabula Rasa</i> from the very start. The entire goal is to give you pause and [[Lie|allow you to think about the choices]] that they make in order to [[Fail|accomplish]] a mission.|Dick Garriott [[Lie|lying]] about how [[good]] the game is.}}

==Collector's Edition==

[[Image:TabulaRasaCollector.jpg|thumb|If you buy this, consider yourself a [[Failure|failure]] at [[No life|life]].]]

Some people are [[Fucktard|fucktarded]] enough to actually buy the "[[Noob|collector's]] edition" of ''Tabula Rasa''. In the [[Noob|Collector's Edition]] of the game, the buyer will [[Buttsecks|receive]]:
* A serial code for unlocking bonus in-game content. In other words, [[Fail|nothing]].
* An exclusive Shell Bot or Pine-Ock pet which just sits right beside the player's character. It contributes nothing to the game at all except making the player look like a complete [[idiot]] for buying the [[Noob|Collector's]] Edition.
* Two exclusive character emotes which [[No one gives a shit|no one cares about]].
* <strike>Three day head-start on the live servers</strike> That's a big, fat, Jew [[lie]].
* A colorful game manual containing concept [[art]] which no one ever looks at. The concept art is basically just [[deviantART|scribbles]].
* A letter briefing from [[LOL WUT|General British]] ([[Dick|Richard]] Garriot has such an [[USI|inflated ego]] that he changed his nickname to "General [[Faggot|British]]").
* A map pack displaying the various game regions
* An AFS piece of Jew gold and set of ''Tabula Rasa'' [[Bitch|dog]] tags.
* A Fold out "black person Ops" poster. Too bad it wasn't a picture of a naked [[Whore|woman]].
* The "Making of" ''Tabula Rasa'' DVD. Yeah, they show you how the creators [[Fail|failed]] at creating a [[MMORPG]].
* Three exclusive in-game [[Shit|items]] granted by the Collector's edition key only. This probably will make the buyer feel "[[Special|shhpesial]]".

==Storyline==
''Tabula Rasa'' (Name blatantly stolen from a [[Buffy]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_Rasa_(Buffy_episode) Episode]) basically focused around humans fighting hordes of [[Tentacle rape|tentacle monsters]] called "The Bane". The "[[Lol wut|story]]" took place in the near future on two planets, Arieki and Foreas, where the A.F.S. (Allied Free Sentients) and The Bane had ridiculous fights over nothing. [[Shit nobody cares about|The term tabula rasa means scraped tablet or clean slate in Latin, referring to a fresh start, or starting over.]] Which is true because everyone who played it now has to start over on another MMO. LOL

That's all it is. That is the "story". The End.

==Character Creation==

[[Image:Tabula_trash.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shit|Where it belongs]]!]]

The character creation revolved around the looks of the player's character and the character classes called "tiers".

When the player started creating their character, he or she had to choose the [[sex]] and appearance of the character. There was not a variety of appearances that the player may set for their character. [[Some argue|It has been said by some]] that [[Sick Fuck|sick fucks]] may have [[masturbate|masturbated]] to the female characters. All characters practically [[Chink|looked the same]]. This may have been due to the [[gook]] company, NCSoft, where everyone looks the same (all [[Azn|Asians]] look the same).  This had little or no effect on the gameplay though because no one saw the character's [[Ugly|fugly]] face.

After the player shits out their character into the game, they had to plan out their "tiers" (which is a complete pain in the ass). These tiers became available to the player later on in ''Tabula Rasa'' as they level up. Players had the option to either become a complete [[Douche|douchebag]] who thinks they can [[Kill it with fire|kill anything]] in their way or a lazy [[Shit|piece of shit]] who sits back and watches everyone else [[Buttsecks|take it in the ass]].

Creating and leveling a character was a complete waste of [[Rape Clock|time]].

==Combat, Leveling, and Logos==

<sub><strong>Gameplay like this is fun for about 30 minutes, and then [[fails]].</strong></sub></center><br><br>

The combat in ''Tabula Rasa'' was so repetitive that it may make the person that was playing shoot himself or <strike>herself</strike> [[No girls|THERE ARE NO WOMEN ON THE INTERNET]] and become [[an hero]]. All the player had to do was make as many explosions around the enemies as possible and [[Columbine|shoot everything that moves]] like [[Rambo]] did. This entertained the retards that liked this game and kept them occupied with shiny things and [[Epilepsy|flashing lights]] on the screen.

One of the main events that the game focused upon was CP. Now, you might be thinking, "WOW, [[Cp|CP]] is in the game? [[Pedophile|Perverts]] must play this game!" Do not get your panties all messed up in a knot though because it is not what you think. In this game, CP was an abbreviation of "Capture Points". [[Dick|Richard]] [[Faggot|Garriot]] just wanted loads of [[Sick Fuck|sick fucks]] to play the game in order to make it more [[Crap|popular]]. "Capture Points" were simply places where a player could [[Fap|grind]] the shit out of their character until their [[Offended|head explodes]] from total boredom.

Another event was the instances in the game (which [[Nobody|no one]] ever did). Due to the lack of [[Noobs|players]] in ''Tabula Rasa'', no group [[Orgy|activities]] can be done. Therefore, the instances were considered worthless pieces of crap which should just be [[Guns|blammed]] off the the game. Sadly, this will never happen because, even though the game already lacks the aspect of what people call "[[fun]]", they want this feature to stay in the game to make it [[Lie|seem like there is a lot to do]].

To make the game even more fucktarded than what it is already, the creators of the game, while sniffing their own asshair, wanted to add worthless jobs in order to make the player work to get their [[LARP|mystical powers]]. The [[Blowjob|jobs]] were to get spells called "Logos" which are aspects to the powers that the player's character uses. These powers do absolutely [[Fail|nothing]] and just make the player's life even more of a pain in this ass.

Overall, combat, leveling, and running around to get Logos was completely [[Retard|retarded]] and [[Fail|failed]] miserably. It was basically ''Tribes'' if ''Tribes'' was a shitty [[MMORPG]] that [[Shit Nobody Cares About|nobody cared about]] with absolutely no replay value whatsoever past the first five minutes.

==Richard Garriott==

[[Image:Richard_in_Spacesuit.jpg|thumb|left|SPACEMAN]]
The game's creator is pretty much a nutcase. Not only is he the son of an astronaut, he is also the creator of the ''[[Ultima]]'' series, and he calls himself [[Unwarranted self-importance|"Lord British"]]. Garriott just seems a little [[Asperger's|out there]]. One of the lulziest things he has ever done was allow TR players' to send their [[Semen|DNA]] into space - [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10002307-52.html and dubbed the mission "Operation Immortality".] Along with TR players' DNA, he has also decided to shoot [[Colbert]]'s [http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54628 DNA into space.] One may wonder if Garriott is really an [[IRL troll]] and just doing things [[for the lulz]]. Then, on November 12, he announced that [http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/49256 he was leaving ''Tabula Rasa''] to pursue other unknown interests (and to launch shit into space.) Many [[MMORPG]] fans guessed that he knew where the game was [[crap|headed]], and knew that the upcoming expansions of ''[[World of Warcraft|Wrath of the Lich King]]'', ''[[EverQuest II|The Shadow Odyssey]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings|Mines of Moria]]'', and ''[[EVE Online|Quantum Rise]]'' would annihilate the shit out of it.

===LAWLSUIT===

Richard Garriott decided to best [[Smedley]] in MMO lulz factor, and in May [[2009]], [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/garriott-suing-ncsoft-for-fraud went to sue NCSoft] (the developers of this game, and who also brought you [[Shit|great products]] such as ''[[Guild Wars]]'' and ''[[City of Heroes]]''.) For [[OH WOW|$27 million]]. Apparently he is suing them for [[fraud]], but [[Shit nobody cares about|the exact reason why he considers it fraud]] is currently unknown. Maybe it's because after he left NCSoft, ten days later the developers announced the shutdown? Lulz shall unfold, however.

Over a year later, on July 30, 2010, Richard Garriot [http://www.massively.com/2010/07/30/richard-garriott-wins-lawsuit-against-ncsoft/ won the lawlsuit]. He won $28 million USD, but NCSoft isn't done yet.

==The Shutdown==

[[Image:Aspergerdance.gif|thumb|The [[Aspergers|reaction]].]]

Inevitably, with the lack of content above level 20, and the abysmal player populations, the game's developers announced that it would [http://kotaku.com/5095941/tabula-rasa-shut-down-team-hit-by-lay-offs shut down on February 28, 2009, along with multiple layoffs]. Fanboys [[Butthurt|wailed]] while other MMO players pointed and laughed.

The game ended with [http://www.massively.com/2009/02/27/tabula-rasas-shutdown-salute-schedule/ every single player and NPC fighting against the aliens until a doomsday device would be activated, thus killing fucking everyone in the process]. [[And nothing of value was lost]].

==Trolling==

There are hardly any ways to [[troll]] people in this game since [[Pwnt|the game's shut down]].<br>

*Say that [[World of Warcraft|WoW]] is way better than ''Tabula Rasa''.

*Rub it in a fan's face that the game was shutdown while all of the other [[MMORPG|MMORPGs]] never had to shutdown. Shit, there are still people playing fucking ''Ultima Online'', ''Ultima fucking Online'', and ''Tabula Rasa'' had to shut down. (Let's pretend HGL, ''[[Fury]]'', and ''Auto Assault'' didn't exist for that one, which shouldn't be too hard, as they were horrendous fucking abysmal games that nobody ever played.)

*Tell the fans that only [[retarded]] people played the game because of the [[Epilepsy|flashing lights]] and shiny things.

*Mention that not even [[SOE]] wanted to nab it from NCSoft and fix it.
