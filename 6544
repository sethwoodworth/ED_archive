'''{{youtube2|haloaholes|DJ KEEMSTAR}} is a leader of a clan on [[xbox|exbawcks]] [[Xbox Live|live]] made up of [[12-year-old boys|12 year olds]] known as the [[12-year-old boys|"Federation of Asshole Gamers"]] or the [[faggot|"F@G"]].  He gained a following of many [[12-year-old boys|12 year old]] [[Halo]] [[fanboys]] who call their [[BDSM|dungeon master]] [[Lie|"Halo's #1 Trashtalker"]]: [[IRL]] he's a [[butthurt]] father with an extreme amount of [[unwarranted self importance]]. DJ spends his life on [[Xbox Live]], [[BlogTV]], and [[jewtube|Youtube]] where [[Talentless|he has 50,000 subscribers from dick riding]] machinima directors and [[Call of Duty]] commentators.  He begged them to advertise his youtube channel but, hilariously enough, the only people that actually subscribed were [[12-year-old boys]]. Surprisingly he is the #1 most subscribed on [[BlogTV]], which he accomplished by [[raging]] to his fans that its his life goal to be the most subscribed on the entire fucking website, but who the fuck uses BlogTV? [[Everyone|Everyone uses Ustream.]] If you think about it, [[True|its not that hard]] getting #1 subscribed on a [[BlogTV|shitty web site]] that no one uses if you spend all day everyday streaming and [[Hitler|commanding little kids to subscribe]]. It is extremely likely that [[Google|he will at some point stumble upon this article]] and turn it into another excuse for him to [[fap]] to his own name while bitching and moaning on [[Shit|his BlogTV broadcast]] for five hours. When this time comes he should [[gtfo]] like the tool he is.
