In the days before [[Google]] and [[Wikipedia]] brought the multitude volumes of humanity's [[Anonymous Borg|collective intelligence]] to you with mere keystrokes, there were the '''Search Engines'''.  In this day and age, Google is THE search engine, so the term itself is deprecated.

==Shit Search Engines==
DISCLAIMER: nobody actually uses any of the following to perform searches anymore.  The Google has superseded all of them.

===Altavista===
In Google's infancy, Altavista reigned supreme in pornfinding mastery.  Altavista also introduced [[42|Babelfish]], which is its lasting legacy, finding use in translating the inane babble in [[your mom]]'s [[scat|scheisse]] videos.

===Dogpile===
Although all search engines are ultimately used to find porn, Dogpile is used exclusively for [[bestiality]] and [[furry]] porn, as the name would imply.  The creators would have you believe that Dogpile is simply an index for real search engines, but nobody really gives a shit.

===Excite===
In the days of Google's infancy, the [[yuppies]] who ran the show over at excite.com took a long hard look at the Google and determined it was "not a threat." [[LOL]] [[owned|PWNT]]

===AskJeeves===

While this is really begging the question, who the fuck is Jeeves and why am I asking him what this rash on my dick could be?

===Lycos===
Lycos was a third-world search engine, used almost entirely by [[Old|old women]].

===Yahoo!===
{{main|Yahoo}}
[[No]]. Just, no. Yahoo! Messenger and Yahoo! Games are bad enough, but their search engine is far worse.

==The Google==
{{main|Google}}
Nothing can stop The Google.  [[Anonymous Borg|It is useless to resist]].
