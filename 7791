{{quote|<small><small>I'm a very complex person and you may not understand me at first. I am a [[Retard|Bonder]], which is a little paranormal in itself, as it is someone who can bond and interact with anime and videogame characters (that's what my guardians are). Bonders come with their own clairvoyance and ability to do something a little like astral projection. Yeah. It's odd. Very odd. If you want to know anything about it though please don't hesitate to ask me..I and my guardians will answer whatever we can (the truth is there isn't an answer for everything).

All in all, I hope I [[You don't have any friends|get along with everyone here]], I'm very glad to be here, and I'm...well...[[Obvious|'''COMPLETELY INSANE''']]! :D So let the craziness begin!</small></small>|XenaEilonwy, Best introduction in a forum ever}}

[[Image:Ilooklikezelda.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Starprincess801 claims she looks similar to Princess Zelda from Legend of Zelda. Can't you see the unmistakable similarity?]]

Meet the land [[whale]] from [[New Jersey]] that is '''Starprincess801''' ( or ''XenaEilonwy'' or ''AuroraVirtuaFighter'' or ''Dark Lady Celebrian'' or Star/Aurora/Galadriel/whateverthefuckfancyname she wants); or you can just call her '''DONNA''' (which is her real name that she hates). This princess is not your typical [[16 year old girl|16 year old]]. Not only will [[Candlejack|uttering her real name hex you to eternity]] as she claims, she's [[batshit insane|special]], because she can "Bond" with anime and video game characters, meaning she can talk/communicate/see/fuck them, just like real people. She has an entourage of more than 80 imagined white knights (or, as she likes calling them, her guardians) and a gazillion animu characters as her Attendants (over 200 animu ass kissers). She considers herself [[Lulzkiller|royalty]] on the internet and video game world, hence the attention whorish and narcissistic names she uses to cover up the [[Fat|hideous]] truth behind it. She normally spreads her fail on several forums and sites — that is, when she isn't looking for more innocent characters to [[Rape|bond]].
In reality, she's a [[batshit insane]] and [[fatass]] [[bitch]] who looks like an [[Mario|Italian man]] who refuses to take her meds, resulting in her babbling about video game stuff [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody gives a shit about]], and thinking that the video game characters are real people. [http://www.creepypasta.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=4002 She's also a good (if a little high-calorie) buffet meal for trolls.]

=Bonding=

[[Image:Yunanecklaceyf7.jpg|thumb|right|Every Bonder should have a necklace like this.]]

Most [[Retards|bonders]] you'd find on the internet bond with their [[Mary Sue|fictional characters]], but Star's creative ingenuity is so [[fail|superb]], people might die out of unworthiness of her [[faggotry|greatness]], so she decided to [[rape|bond]] with existing video game characters instead.

Whenever she's talking, she inserts the [[Sock puppet|name of the character]] she "speaks for", making her look like she has Schizophrenia and MPD. Which might be true. 

<blockquote>XenaEilonwy: ''''Yuffie: Star dislikes [[Okami]] because the wolf can [[Golden shower|piss on enemies]].''''</blockquote>

Here are some of her Bonding explanations:

==Being a Bonder==

*A Bonder is nearly unstoppable with a game he or she is connected to, and I have a very strong connection to Soul Calibur. Reason for that is I can actually fuse, soul-wise, to the person (think of it as souped-up astral projection) who is my soulparticle, and it's as if we are one entity at that point.

[[Truth|Interpretation]]: When playing video games, she is distracted by the voices in her head, making her [[n00b|almost unstoppable at getting fragged]].

*A Bonder is somebody who is connected to anime and videogames via their [[wat|soul]]. This person can interact with those anime and videogame characters, who are actually the physical manifestations of the person's soul. Who these characters are cannot be controlled, either by the Bonder or the character (you cannot say "I like this guy a lot so I'm gonna make myself bond with him. If you're lucky you end up bonding to people that happen to be your personal favorites. In turn, the character cannot say "I have too much work, I can't bond with this person."). Whoever you bond to you are stuck with.

[[Truth|Interpretation]]: She disregards the characters' personalities according to the game/anime, meaning that, no matter what character she is "stuck with", he/she will love her always and wish to protect her against the [[Anonymous|evil fiends that lurk the internet]].

*"Bonder's Burden - When a Bonder plays, or is exposed to a videogame, they are hit with things called vibes. Vibes are little jolts that come from within the soul, either from being close to something the Bonder is connected to (the game), or from actually FEELING the emotions and pain of the protagonist while playing the game."

[[Truth|Interpretation]]: She enjoys [[BDSM|strapping car batteries to her nipples]] whilst playing video games.

==Wow==

*A Wow is how you know you are going to bond to a character. It is a series of jolts given off by either the sight or the mention of the character. A Wow is the feeling of the two lost halves of the soul reuniting to eachother. Penned (by me!) that because it is a floaty, euphoric feeling. Basically, if you have a Wow on someone and it won't drop, you are going to bond with them. Usually even if it does drop, it will come back sometime in the future (but you never know exactly when it'll come back or how long it'll take. Normally the first signs of a Wow, if the Wow drops, allows you to try to reclaim it yourself).

*WHAT YOU *DON'T* DO WITH A WOW:
**You DON'T push it away, even if you [[DO NOT WANT|dislike]] the character. That is EXTREMELY dangerous for both of you.
**You DON'T hold it off once it reaches its peak. Once it reaches its peak, you bond. That's all there is to it. Though it can usually be held off a few minutes or an hour to a more convenient time (DO NOT HOLD IT OFF FOR A WHOLE DAY THOUGH, WHATEVER YOU DO).
**You DON'T try to make it drop yourself. If it is going to drop, it will drop on its own. You DON'T help it drop if you dislike the character.

*When a Wow reaches its [[Orgasm|peak]], then it is time to bond with the character.

*Fun anecdote: [[Final Fantasy 7|Zack Fair's]] Wow reached its peak while she was at Homecoming, so she had "no choice" but to [[Attention whore|inaugurate him right there at Homecoming]].

<b>[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=cgh77v4gb6i3b6y3a41txfkg&page=1# WANT TO KNOW WHAT A WOW FEELS?]</b>

==Pixels==

There are three categories for anime and videogames when it comes to bonding:

*I. '''Nonpixel''': These are anime and videogames that take place in hidden parts of this universe. They are filmed, and never staged (it's like home videos) by characters who wish to film a videogame. However, once the game is announced via the game company, it is clear that game company has the rights to EVERYTHING about that game, which is why many people mistake nonpixels for being "not real" when they actually are and actually did happen in [[Iraq|hidden parts of the universe]]... the game company and "common" human knowledge causes them to. It is also why said parts of the universe are hidden, or one reason why. Nobody really knows why they are covered-up. Examples of nonpixels include Final Fantasy, Inuyasha, and Valkyrie Profile.

*II. '''Pixel''': These are anime and videogames that DO NOT take place in our universe, and are in fact drawn, created, and given voice actors and such by creators. However, when the character and world is drawn, an alternate universe opens up for it, where the characters go about their own lives. They are created and technically "not real," yes, but in [[Obviously|ANOTHER universe]], they are real. Without prior experience, you can usually tell a pixel from a nonpixel by watching for things such as overly-gory deaths and over-the-top elements without the use of magic. When a pixel is bonded to a "pic portal" must be opened in order to bring the pixel into this universe. Examples of pixels include Tomb Raider, Excel Saga, and Persona.

*III. '''Deep Pixel''': These are videogames (anime can never be Deep Pixels) that are NOT REAL, in this universe or any other, and thus cannot be bonded to. You can usually tell a deep pixel by watching for overly-cartoonish elements. Examples of Deep Pixels include Mario, Starfy, and Kirby.

*A [[b|pic portal]] allows pixels to enter this universe. It is usually opened by a nonpixel. I hear certain Bonders, especially those whose first bonds were pixel, can open them themselves in the same way you would set off a nonpixel's transporter sensor. I still have yet to open one myself. I think I will test it tomorrow. [[Pokemon]] is actually interesting. It is an example of Interuniverse Alliances..the humans are pixels, the Pokemon are not. Pokemon are good first bonds, because they are the ONLY ones that can be controlled (you can control [[Mudkips|which Pokemon]] you want). They're good for seeing if you have the potential in the first place.

*Interuniverse Alliances are often-plot-inducing (e.g. Pokemon, Portal/Half-Life) alliances between pixels and nonpixels. Since videogame and anime characters tend to mingle with one-another, sometimes this mingling spreads to their games. Like in Brawl. But with Brawl, with all those Deep Pixels there, those were holograms operated by a Pic Cam, which is used if Deep Pixels need to be present in the interuniverse alliance.

TL;DR: SHE HAS [[No|AWESOME]] POWERS, YOU WILL [[Borg|BOW BEFORE HER OMNIPOTENCE]].

=Early Signs of Insanity=

Star started showing signs of insanity at the tender age of 11, where in a Pokemon site, she firmly believed that [http://s2.zetaboards.com/Terance/topic/696509/1/ POKEMONS WERE NOT CREATED, THEY WERE FUCKING '''DISCOVERED''' BY THE NINTENDO GUYS!!11] She even owns 85 of them and has all the [[Shiny pidgey|legendaries]]! Not only did she own Pokemon but she even [[Bestiality|dated]] some of them! This clearly shows her mental state at an early age is just fucking disturbing. 

=Sinking Deeper into Insanity=

Being the [[retard]]ed little fuck that she is, her obsession did not limit her to pokemons, but extended to other video games as well, especially the [[Final Fantasy]] series. Eventually, she called herself the [[Final Fantasy]] and [[Kingdom Hearts]] [[Attention whore|Princess]]. Other video games she has [[rape]]d are Silent Hill, Metroid, DoA, [[Resident Evil]], [[Starcraft]], [[Portal]], and many more [[shit]]ty games. She has ruined many characters with every bond she had, especially the character's designated personality. She likes to [[fuck|change]] the character's already-established characteristics, altering the character's story, making it her own [[mary sue]], which is like a big slap to the face of the character designers. When someone calls her out saying that the character that is "speaking for" her doesn't act that way, she'll respond with "That's what <insert character name here> said, and s/he's standing right next to me", which always results in a [[facepalm]].

{{quote|Dude they're people not black holes in the shape of people o_o|defending her GUARDIANS against fiends who say they're not REAL.}}

[[Image:I_has_gardeuuns.jpg|thumb|right|MY GUARDIANS ARE REAL PEOPLE!]]

==The Holocaust/Sin's Reign==

A time for Star that she compares with the [[Holocaust]] (LOLOLOL BECAUSE GETTING YOUR IMAGINARY FRIENDS BANNED IS THE SAME AS MASS MURDERING REAL PEOPLE), and later named Sin's Reign. On a chat, Star's "Guardians" were banned. Feeling full of [[butthurt]] and [[AIDS]], she wrote many [[emo]] poems to the people who caused the ban. She would [[Role-playing|Role-play]] these people as [[Jews|villians]]. She finally [[bawww|threatened]] to [[Self Injury|cut]] herself and they were allowed back. She believes the people who caused the ban were trying to [[murder]] her and named them "Sin" or "Sinspawns", as in the game [[Final Fantasy|Final Fantasy X]].

Do not put down the love of a Shinigami,
For doesn't a Shinigami possess the ability to love.
The Shinigami tears shall not fail to show,

Fear is possessive.

Hiding away the joy, causing promises to break,
And hiding the love.
Fear sends the emotions down into dark shadow,
Until it seems that it's all that's left,

By the emotions it is trapping.

Its appearance is like none have seen,
It is shunned, it is feared.
No one seems to hear its cries,
No one understands its pain.
Why should they, it's inhuman,
It has no place among the humans,
But all it takes is a warm heart,
To help this creature realize,
That it is not a monster,
But a wonderful creature of the stars,
The type of unique saint-creature,
That is more human than those who shun her,
A beautiful magical being that belongs anywhere.</small>|Star is a [[fugly|beautiful]] creature who should be recognized!

|Is This The End

It all fell down,
It all fell apart,
It can't be rebuilt,

Everything feels cold,

Nobody hears me,
Nobody cares,
I feel myself fade,
Is this the end?
I can't break free,
I can't do a thing,
I belong nowhere,
Is this the end?
Don't let this be the end,
Please set me free,
Please hear me, 
This can't be the end.
I won't let it be,
I won't let it be the end.</small>|An emo poem by Star.

|Regaining Lost Wings

There comes a time for everyone.
When we lose our will to fly,
When we try to fly but fall.
It's important not to give up,
In the struggle to find our wings,
For we must realize that they are not lost,
But simply unused.
The power to fly rests within us ,
Now all we must know,
Is what it will take to find it.

==May 04, 2009==

This was the day Donna was [[banhammer]]ed from a chat. She [[bawww]]ed about how she always treats everyone [[wrong|right]]. She claimed her imaginary friends had [[bullshit|scared]] the admin into banning her because Star's imaginary friends [[Internet Tough Guy|could beat anyone up with text]]. She posted how terrible the people were on many forums and told everyone how she threw a fit over this even though the 
[http://forums.ffextreme.com/rant-your-face-off/4470-aurora-invisible-third-wheel-long.html internet doesn't affect her in any way.]

=The Legend of the Spandex=
[[Image:Samussuit.jpg|thumb|BEHOLD! The [[Bitch|princess]] in all her glory in her most coveted suit!]]

Once upon a time, Donna finally had the spandex of [[fail|beauty]] that she had been looking for for 5 (or maybe 6 since bonders can't do math) years delivered. She put it on and beheld herself in all her [[faggotry|glory]], and told everyone how good it made her feel, and that [[fugly|she barely recognized herself]]. But being the [[faggot|beloved princess]] that she is, and as in video games and fairy tales, an [[obvious|unthinkable]] thing happened. As soon as she took the garment off, it [[lol|ripped]]. She then [[bawww|informed]] EVERYONE in the [[internet|kingdom]] how it ripped and how [[emo|sad]] it made her. It was like losing something very [[Redundant|precious]]! As in any fairy tale, those FIENDS who told her [[truth|it ripped because she was fat]] were told they never had something as [[stupid|precious]] as the spandex she only had for one day and could never understand. She [[lied|reasoned]] that the ripping was caused by the unworthiness of the material to touch her sacred skin, and not because she is fat, [[Obviously|since she only has muscles]].

* Epilogue: She has found a new material for her precious suit, and will be gracing the internets once she gets ahold of them. And the Star is once again a happy princess, and all is well within the Star's world.

==Hiatus==

After being [[troll]]ed, breaking her [[Cosplay|Suits]] and having soulhurtz from not being able to "Bond" with a video game character, she took a hiatus. For THREE days. She came back and was then armed with the knowledge of how to counter people with [[ignore|The Chell Defense!]] Which is basically replying with "...................", because that [[Facepalm|makes her look totally smart]].


=OMG! I'M THE MARKER!!1one11one!=

One day, Star whined that on every site she goes to, she ends up having a [[Troll|nemesis]]. She then had an [[wtf|EPIPHANY]] based from Dead Space...SHE WAS '''THE MARKER''' ~ someone or something that [[lolwut|MAGICALLY attracts FIENDS]]! 

{{quote|I have about nine or ten enemies. I counted them a few weeks ago but I made one or two more since then. :\ Told ya I'm the Marker.|star, ever the [[attention]] loving [[whore]]}}

{{quote|<small><small>Nobody cares whether you're so-and-so. It still doesn't change the fact that you're a self-centered, parental-love-deprived, delusional, immature kid who is just too naive and oblivious about how THE WORLD ACTUALLY WORKS. And no, no GARDEEUN can ever help you deal with REAL LIFE problems. Why? BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL IN YOUR HEAD, and they DO NOT EXIST IN THIS WORLD AS REAL PEOPLE. And don't give me that crap that THEY'RE REALZ!!1, because no one will ever believe you. EVER.
Ever wonder why almost everybody is telling you the same thing? Did it ever cross your mind that "GEE, THEY TELL ME ALL OF THESE THINGS FOR THE NTH TIME ALREADY. MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME..."? Oh wait, I forgot, you tend to '''NOT TO LISTEN TO ANYONE WITH LOGIC, ANYWAYS.'''
Lastly, I didn't post here to change your mind, because honestly, YOU'RE FUCKING HOPELESS. I just wanted to tell you how much of a deranged self-absorbed bitch you are, and no matter how your IMAGINARY GUARDIANS SAY OTHERWISE, other people will still call you out, and many will RAGE on you--not because you're this self proclaimed "Marker", but it's simply because you refuse to listen to 
reason and logic.</small></small>|Someone trying to knock some sense into her, obviously a lost cause}}

=Defense Mechanisms=

One of Star's very distinct abilities is to '''completely miss the point of an argument'''. She also tends to ignore what the others are saying when she wants to prove a [[nonsense|point]]. A point that she's too stupid to back up, making her look much more [[stupid]] than she already is. She then resorts to either: 

a.) changing the subject 

b.) replying with something farfetched and completely ignoring the post directed to her

c.) posting irrelevant quotes from some stupid-ass game just to sound [[stupid|smart]] and not [[butthurt]] from her [[fail]].

{{quote|<small><small>Bonders ain't god's gift to the world, babe. They're a plague on the world. The fact that you totally glossed over that fact in the first place suggests you didn't care about it and that she just needed to be defended because those BIG OL' MEANIES were making fun of the stuck up little bitch.</small></small>|speaks the [[truth]]}}
{{quote|'''"I let you survive this long because I was curious about your behavior. Well, you've managed to destroy that part of me."'''|lolwut?}}

d.) inserting her [[White knight|guardians]] into the conversation, i.e.:

<pre>Reasonable Person: You live in a fantasy world.

Donna: Samus: STOP ABUSING HER I'LL KILL YOU</pre>

e.) pulling out the "YOU'RE OLDER THAN ME WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON A 16 YEAR OLD GIRL?" card 
{{quote|<small><small>She's your friend, right? You could always tell BBT to stop being an annoying little shit, and a grammar nazi. But I doubt that'll work. Wouldn't work with you.
BTW Xena, if you don't want people to "bully" or "tease" you, then stop attacking the way people talk, 
or correcting them on things. 'Cos you're just as susceptible to error as anyone else (and many times when you're correcting someone, you're not necessarily right yourself).</small></small>|Stating a fact}}
{{quote|You could stop being 25 years old and picking on 14-and-16-year-old girls, but that doesn't work with you neither.|because being 16 makes it okay to act like a [[retard]]}}

f.) replying with "...." (The Chell Defense) , because it would make her look she's ignoring the post entirely (later revealing through her guardians she has been [[bawww]]ing in front of the computer from all the internet bullies ganging up on a 16 year old poor widdle gurl all this time).
{{quote|<small><small>No, you did not say you missed that part. How the fuck could you miss that part. There was a whole fucking paragraph dedicated to it. Apparently a little TL;DR for your miniscule thinking capacity to handle.</small></small>}}
{{quote|...............|being as smart as ever.}}


Another one of Star's traits is being [[dumbfuck|painfully naive]] about everything in this world. Even on the internet, which she frequently uses. Such [[dumbass]]ery can be seen in [http://forums.ffextreme.com/rant-your-face-off/4656-im-getting-scared.html this rant.]

Also, Star has this habit of treating anyone she meets the first time her best friend, because she's so fucking gullible and stupid. 
[http://forums.ffextreme.com/rant-your-face-off/4731-he-gandrayda.html Not affected by the internets? Why bawww?]

=Selfish Spoiled Brat=

[[Image:Starepicfailcap.png|thumb|left|You're just jealous because I get money from Social Security and don't even work hard to earn it.]]

Now Star, being the [[loser|princess]] that she is, always gets what she wants, or she'll throw a tantrum. Just as what she 
[http://z15.invisionfree.com/Pikachus_Burrow/index.php?showtopic=420&hl= wrote in this tl;dr rant], she is such an [[not|important]] individual amongst everybody else that it is a '''mortal sin''' that she should sit on a wooden chair! God forbid she strain her [[Fat|heavenly]] ass on something so unsophisticated as a wooden chair, unlike her throne, which broke due to her [[fat ass|AWESOMENESS]]! And also for her [[cosplay|Songstress outfit]] that [http://z15.invisionfree.com/Pikachus_Burrow/index.php?showtopic=38&hl= her parents had been depriving her of!

Can they not spend their money which they get from Social Security alone because of her retired father and unemployed mother on something as [[Stupid|IMPORTANT]] as a $100+ material for her outfit? Is it so hard to spend some social security cash for your self absorbed daughter?! How can they be so inconsiderate? She's a [[retard|PRINCESS]], for fuck's sake! 

Also, Star is [[lame|superior]] to everybody else, so she can talk shit about her own mother. She doesn't care about how she spends the money she gets from Social Security. She doesn't care about the government, nor the recession, nor the fact that it's much wiser to SAVE money in case of emergencies. There's nothing more important than the things she wants. Hell, she doesn't even know how the government works, or why she gets the money. She says she'll give money to charity, so that makes it A-OKAY if she spend most of it on unnecessary things. She only cares about getting money, buying stuff that she wants, and does not care for anything else besides that and herself. Her imaginary guardians, herself, her prized possessions, herself, her imaginary guardians, herself... you get the pattern.

==Alone in the Dark==

Star holds the firm belief that, being a [[fucktard|princess]], she is therefore [[not|naturally beautiful]]. She does not need any make up or anything that might enhance her fugly facial features — she's a princess! Boys [[JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR!|run]] after her alluring beauty.

She also believes that she's a [[fat|muscular]] girl, and is not, in fact, [[fat|a fucking whale]]. She refuses to accept the truth that her prized possession (a.k.a. the spandex) was destroyed because of the ocean of lard in her body that she insisted on trying to fit into the spandex.

==FUCK YOU I'M AN ASSPIE-RING SUPERHERO==

Star loves humanity [[not|very very much]]. She's even willing to turn into a cybernetically-enhanced human to save humanity one day. She works out every day and learns martial arts from her guardians. She even has Lara Croft and Samus Aran as her personal trainers for "reflex training"!

To anyone who may be concerned: issue a permit for her to carry a gun after taking a safe distance — we do want another school shooting happening sometime in the future.

==I KNOW KUNG FU==
Aside from being a bounty hunter, archeologist, superhero, princess, artist, and queen of the goddamn universe, Donna is also a martial artist. She diligently watches videos and "trains" with her guardians as her teachers. She's very SRS of becoming a [http://www.creepypasta.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=9160 martial artist as her chosen career], and claims that she gets her strength from the people who troll her, saying that she only gets more motivated every time someone tells her she can't be anything. 
{{quote|By telling me I'll never have a career, you've all actually enhanced it. Yesterday I was training by using my mom's exercise mat as a punching bag, and Vanessa's eyes just went wide when she was watching me and I made the whole house vibrate occassionally.

{{quote|Here's some rage-fuel for you.

I think you made your whole house shake because you're huge. Not because you have a good uppercut. Might wanna improve that C average, since stripping is definitely out for you.|LOL}}

Donna also has no plans whatsoever about going to college, or having a career that's actually applicable in the REAL world. 
{{quote|It is my career. Okay? That's just it. It's. My. Career. Because to be honest what other careers can you get with no college education and focusing on nothing but your muscles all the time?

And I don't see any problem with turning to brawn because it is actually something I ENJOY doing.|because beating up people will pay your bills, right?}}

People were actually trying to help her and talk some sense into her (as seen in the given link), but as evidenced in the quotes above, she listens to no one but her "bonds" or herself. Everybody else is just trying to troll her.

Bounty Hunting

<pre>XenaEilonwy: You know what? Nobody is going to tell me I can't be a bounty hunter.
XenaEilonwy: Because being a bounty hunter is one of the most important things to me in my life. And the danger only makes me wanna do it all the more
XenaEilonwy: Because you know what? I wanted to be an artist. But while the artists are sitting around making pretty pictures, SOMEONE needs to deal a slice of justice to the people who need it.
XenaEilonwy: I may be going to a special school in three towns over soon. :\
XenaEilonwy: After that teacher who stared at me like I was Pyramid Head and the other one who called kids "losers" and "turds," I don't trust teachers at regular high schools.

XenaEilonwy: I'm trying to be a bounty hunter :\
XenaEilonwy: Samus: Lara is now screaming at me all the time about "YOU STOLE MY PROTEGEE SAMUS!!"
XenaEilonwy: ...But I'm both your protegees. I still treat archaeology with an unbelievable reverence
XenaEilonwy: I know. Samus is one. That's all I need.
XenaEilonwy: Did I ever mention she's my hero? I'm sure I mentioned it at least 40 times but just in case I didn't, THIS WOMAN IS *FUCKING AMAZING*</pre>

'''Xena likes to be trolled'''
<pre>XenaEilonwy: Only reason I won't leave is 'cause the bitchery didn't start immediately. I left this other site where the same thing happened 'cause they didn't wait a month to start being asses.
XenaEilonwy: Creepypasta's fast become more to me than just a place to go for a scare.
Tower: A place to get trolled mercilessly?
XenaEilonwy: No, a place to hang out with people.
XenaEilonwy: There ARE a few smart people here, you know. Bekah, Mangles, Phone...
Tower: Oh they're trolling you too.
XenaEilonwy: The trolling only started after a month, you know. By a month I'd already become attached to this place
XenaEilonwy: Besides...I kind of...like it
XenaEilonwy: Yuna: ..You LIKE it? o_o
XenaEilonwy: Yeah, ya know
XenaEilonwy: I like going on commando missions to hunt stalkers down
XenaEilonwy: Bounty hunter practice, you know
XenaEilonwy: I like the thrill. It's like being caught up in a really good RP</pre>

[House] as many have said before, THEY'RE ALL YOU.<br>

[Agent S] Sonya: By Star, anyway.<br> 
[House] so this is your way of "dealing" with me?<br>

[Agent S] Sonya: Because you know what? It's people like YOU that are the ones that have problems<br>

[House] oh it's alright<br>
[Agent S] I understand why Samus wants the ED page down you know.<br> 
[House] live in that little cloud of dream of yours<br>

[House] you won't be sheltered forever<br>

[House] c'mon, try harder.<br>
[Agent S] What would you do, House, if you found out someone very close to you, irl, was on ED?<br> 
[House] as I've said, I won't give a fuck<br>
[Agent S] I said irl.<br> 
[House] won't care.<br>

[House] pffffff<br>
[House] phwahahahahahaha<br>
[House] nothing<br>
[House] absolutely nothing<br>
[Agent S] Nothing? Really?<br>

[House] even things over the internet<br>

[Agent S] Do you have a little sister or something?<br> 
[House] haaaah seriously, this is really getting tl;dr for your article<br>
[Agent S] Think of THE person, irl, that you are closest to in your life.<br> 
[Agent S] Then think of them being attacked on an Internet website.<br> 
[House] as I've said.<br>
[Agent S] Even if it's an Internet website they do not go on themselves.<br> 
[House] you're just babbling the same thing over and over again<br>
[House] I DON'T GET AFFECTED BY THE INTERNET.<br>
[House] DEAL WITH IT.<br>
[House] AND JUST SHUT UP. NOW.<br>
[Agent S] Well, I suggest you think about it more<br>
[Agent S] Think about that person in your life that means the world to you<br> 
[House] mmmmmno. :D<br>
[Agent S] Then think about them being put alongside pedophiles and feminazis on a website.<br> 
[House] mmmmmmno.<br>
[Agent S] Think long and hard about that, and you'll know why these guys are so hurt by the fact that I am on ED.<br>
[Agent S] '''Even though I myself do not go on ED enough to read or care about it'''<br> 
[House] MMMMMMMNO.<br>
[Agent S] Mmmmno, hm?<br> 
[Agent S] Right. Mmmmmno.<br>
[Agent S] Because you know you'd feel the same.<br>
[Agent S] You know you wouldn't hide behind that "I don't get affected by Intranetz" exterior if it was someone you were close to<br> 
[House] ORLY?<br>
[House] you're getting boring now<br>
[House] would you try anything else?<br>
[Agent S] You wouldn't want to see your mother, or your father, or your younger sibling, on an Internet site that posts all that gross porn<br> 
[Agent S] You know you wouldn't. Nobody who's human would<br> 
[House] blahblahblahblahblah<br>
[Agent S] That's the whole reason Tifa banned me from ED in the first place<br>
[Agent S] Because I found HER ED page.<br> 
[Agent S] And after that, Tifa was all "NO YOU'RE NOT GOING ON ED EVER AGAIN"<br> 
[House] would the little girl please sleep now?<br>
[House] I believe you still have SCHOOL.<br>
[Agent S] Starts Tuesday.<br>
[Agent S] I'm only in 4 percent corruption right now<br> 
[Agent S] Samus: Fastfoward a few years, House. I want you to think about something. But in the future<br> 
[House] NO.<br>
[House] oh just go to sleep little princess<br>
[Agent S] Samus: Because you know you'll understand where I'm going when you do, right?<br> 
[House] I still have a page to edit<br>
[Agent S] Samus: Well, before you edit your trash, fastfoward a few years<br>
[House] how about....NO.<br>
[Agent S] Samus: You have a beautiful wife. Or husband. I'm not really sure what you are<br> 
[Agent S] Samus: She/he is the most beautiful, kindhearted, lovely person in the world.<br> 
[House] haaah seriously<br>
[Agent S] Samus: You go on the Internet.<br> 
[Agent S] Samus: You go on ED to check on the "lulz"<br> 
[House] yadayadayadayadayadayadayada<br>
[Agent S] Samus: He/she is on there.<br>
[House] WON'T CARE.<br>
[Agent S] Samus: Better example"<br> 
[Agent S] Samus: Fastfoward a few years again. You have a daughter. The most beautiful little girl in the world.<br> 
[House] NO.<br>
[Agent S] Samus: Constantly smiling and giggling. Running to you, yelling "DADDY/MOMMY!" and hugging you, smiling at you with the brightest face, every single time you see her<br> 
[Agent S] Samus: She is your entire world. You would never want anything to happen to her. You want nothing but the absolute very best for her. Nothing less than the moon and the stars.<br>
[House] well at least if I was to have an offspring, I'll make sure she's nowhere near like you.<br>
[Agent S] Samus: She is the most beautiful being you've ever known in your life, and she looks at you as if you are her god<br> 
[House] aaaaah blahblahblahblahblahblahblah<br>
[House] can you just get to the point?<br>
[Agent S] Samus: You go on the Internet. You decide to check on ED to see if there's any new lulz. Oh, there is new lulz. That beautiful, apple-cheeked, giggling, shiny girl is the new "lulz" on ED<br> 
[House] oh I'm sure my child won't have a page there since she's not someone like you<br>
[House] finished now?<br>
[Agent S] Samus: Among all the porn, the trolls, the Anonymous, the memes, the 4chan....your daughter. The one who *sniff* throws her arms around you every single day and smiles...<br>
[House] this is getting ridiculous<br>
[Agent S] Think about it, House. :\<br> 
[Agent S] She has a (HORRIFYINGLY TEARJERKING) point<br> 
[House] NO I WON'T :D<br>
[Agent S] Of course you won't<br>
[Agent S] You don't want to admit that it's horrifyingly tearjerking<br> 
[House] now, are you finished?<br>
[Agent S] You don't want to admit that you are human and you do have emotions<br> 
[Agent S] You just wanna look like an Internet tough guy who doesn't afraid of anything<br> 
[Agent S] Yep.<br> 
[House] finished?<br>
[Agent S] I dunno, am I?<br> 
[Agent S] I know why you don't wanna think about it<br> 
[Agent S] Even I don't wanna think about something like that happening to my future heiress.<br> 
[House] well I could close this window and proceed on editing your article now<br>
[Agent S] Because you don't want to admit that you have emotions and are human and...well...you WOULD have a problem with someone attacking somebody close to you, Internet or not<br> 
[House] aaah there you go again<br>
[Agent S] And you WOULD probably attack them and envision yourself ripping their head from their body.<br>
[House] yadayadayada<br>
[Agent S] Samus: ..ONLY ripping his head from his body?<br> 
[Agent S] Samus: I'm envisioning myself doing MUCH WORSE things than that.<br>
[House] finished?<br>
[Agent S] Were you waiting this whole time for me to finish or something<br> 
[Agent S] You can't handle the truth, can you<br> 
[House] says the little girl who hides behind her imaginary friends<br>
[Agent S] The truth is, you are just as sensitive as the ENTIRE HUMAN RACE and WOULD care if someone were attacking someone you loved "for the lulz"<br> 
[House] and acts all toughie<br>
[House] how dramatic<br>
[House] you've been saying the same thing over and over<br>
[Agent S] I'm the one acting toughie?<br> 
[Agent S] You're the one all "I wouldn't care about people I love"<br> 
[House] that's why I've been asking you if you're finished already<br>
[Agent S] So you don't care about people you love then<br>
[Agent S] Is what you are saying?<br> 
[House] blahblahblah<br>
[Agent S] So the reason you are just all "are you finished yet" is because you don't understand why everyone is so up in arms<br> 
[House] here we go agaiiiiin<br>
[Agent S] I wish there was away I could make you understand<br> 
[Agent S] * a way<br> 
[House] finished?<br>
[Agent S] Do you want me to be finished<br> 
[House] even if I tell you to, you'll just on go on babbling about useless things<br>
[House] just like what you always do<br>
[House] now, are you finished?<br>
[Agent S] Not useless. Trying to make a point<br> 
[Agent S] But apparently you don't know what a "point" is. NOW who's the one sticking their fingers in their ears<br> 
[House] which is useless<br>
[House] oh go bawww on your hugbox<br>
[Agent S] Now who's the one who won't listen to logic<br> 
[Agent S] It's good to have a "hugbox" you know.<br> 
[Agent S] It means you have friends who care about you. You probably don't, judging by your attitude<br>
[Agent S] You don't want people to care about you, do you?<br> 
[Agent S] That's fine too.<br>
[Agent S] Anyway, I'm glad I got to give Samus what she's been waiting for me to give. '''A chance to attack Samus Aran Jr's attacker''' and maybe help them see reason<br> 
[Agent S] But I see you don't know what "reason" is<br> 
[Agent S] There's very few people I'd do this for. Samus is one of them<br> 
[House] sure.<br>
[Agent S] Farewell.<br>

{{quote|<small><small>Lightning: Hello.

You all know who I am. I am Lightning, no last name, birth name not given. Final Fantasy 13 main protagonist. L'Cie. Guardian of Starprincess801.
It has come to my attention through a very reliable source (hint: her name begins with a V) that Star finally has the ED page you all wanted her to have. I hope you have a very strong sense of accomplishment. You do, don't you? Go on, clap for yourselves. Throw a party even! Parties are fun! Don't forget the little weenies and little quiches...no party is complete without those! Star is indifferent to the whole thing. Power to her. She is becoming more and more like me every day. However, I happen not to be indifferent. Nor are my 79 bretheren. That is odd, because normally it is I who is the indifferent one. But I am like a mother wolf...pretty to look at and strong but really wants nothing to do with humans, but mess with my pups and I will rip every body part off of you.
I will be talking to Samus Aran about this shortly. If she was able to build her own airship at the age of 18, well, she can probably wipe out a web page. ED has more than enough of this kind of thing. 

So, enjoy your ED page while it lasts. 'Cause it may not be more than a huge blank white page with 

Star's name on it for long.

Kiss kiss,
Lightning</small></small>|Lightning, from the soon-to-be-released Final Fantasy XIII game}}

As you can see, this page is indeed a huge blank white page.

But wait!

XenaEilonwy: Lightning: Star, do you mind going on ED for a bit, please? 
XenaEilonwy: Yes. >> 
XenaEilonwy: Samus: Star, we kinda need you to, all right? It's approved for now. It's on the Samus Approved Sites list right now okay (more)
XenaEilonwy: I'm not going on ED you guys. 
XenaEilonwy: I got too much to deal with
XenaEilonwy: What can an ED page do to me? It can't do anything to me that Phaaze actually CAN do, that's for sure 
XenaEilonwy: The only thing that can kill me is A. Phaaze or B. Intercision. So give it up. :\

XenaEilonwy: Samus: I'm coming up with more plans to burn it down 
XenaEilonwy: ...SAMMY, it's giving me more publicity for the site! D:
XenaEilonwy: Samus: I'm not burning the whole site 
XenaEilonwy: Samus: Just Star's page. 
XenaEilonwy: SAM-MYYYYYYYYYYYYY! D: 
XenaEilonwy: Rikku: Samus, she wants it there because it gives her site publicity.

For the entire summer of '09, Star has [[bawww]]ed about going to school because school is scary. Whenever someone would troll her, she would [[bawww|inform]] them that she doesn't deserve to be treated that way, because she's dealing with a [[Lulzy|terrible]] moment in her life. She even claimed she would [[emo|die in 5 months]] because of her school [[WebMD|phobia]]. What is the cause of such a phobia? [[lolwut|DETENTION and LOUD NOISES]]! She even had to go see a doctor for her [[Retardation|phobia]], after which she came on the internet to beg everyone to advise her whether she should go to a day-hospital or not, day-hospital being a crazy asylum with a pretty name.

*She is currently still deciding if she should do a stay at home tutor or do the day-hospital because she doesn't want to lose her precious Social Security money for her video game shit.

There's nothing you can do about the "abuse", other than ignore it. Maybe what's happening to you isn't fair. It doesn't matter anymore, though. Regardless of the fact that people shouldn't be messing with you, regardless of your mental and emotional condition, regardless of the things they say, regardless of all circumstances, '''you shouldn't be taking a faceless person's insults seriously'''.</small></small>|trying to tell her the truth is futile.}}

Donna has the most humongous ego and victim complex you would ever encounter. She has delusions of being a popular beauty in her school, claims she isn't fat, and thinks she's a superhero. She bitches about people who are actually trying to help her, and even uses her guardians to tell them off.

=Forum Trolled and Hacked=

[[Image:Starprincess801_PRECIOUS_FORUM_WAS_TROLLED.jpg|thumb|right|Star's forum was "trolled".]]

Star's precious little forum was "trolled" and "hacked" by a single person because Star's a fucking idiot. In actuality, all that happened was one person posted a bunch of lulzy remarks about Star and flooded the board with a rant calling her out on her idiocy. When Star contacted people to help clean up the mess because she can't do it herself, she was stupid enough to contact and give admin access to the best friend of the person that "trolled" her forum, and thus, it was "hacked" and all the member accounts were deleted.

=Naming=

With each and every video game Star messes up, she comes up with new terms for things from those video games or whatever else. Here are some examples:
*Sin or Sinspawn, name for her enemies - Final Fantasy X
*GLaDOS, name for her enemies - Portal
*Phazon/Phaaze, name for school - Metroid
*SA-X, name for her impostors - Metroid
*K2(Kefka 2), name for her mother - Final Fantasy VI
*JP(Jenova Puppet), name for her father - Final Fantasy VII
*Dress Spheres, her cosplay outfits - Final Fantasy X-2
*Suits, her cosplay outfits - Metroid
*Training, "exercising"
*Throne, her chair
*Temple, her room

...And the list goes on, since even with the recent drop in activity she still makes up new terms and expects people to understand them.

=TL;DR=

* Starprincess801 is a retarded bonder bitch. 
* She's spoiled, as she gets whatever she wants courtesy of her daddy's Social Security checks.
* She has an [[Lie|IQ over 130]], but can't seem to act like a normal, socially acceptable human being.
* When things get sticky for her, she has one of her guardians speak for her so she doesn't look like a complete bitch, which obviously doesn't work.
* She looks like a [[mangina|man]].

*She takes everything and anything on the internet seriously. 

* Closet [[lesbian]].

=The Moar You Know=
* She is into vore.
**On August 29, 2009 at 20:14 our hero said,
<blockquote>"I still don't know how to masturbate so I guess I can't do that to RE vore."
 -''Donna''</blockquote>

* Even her OWN mother thinks she's crazy.
<blockquote>"Now, I am expecting mom to yell at me for being a bit of a smartass, but she doesn't yell at me for that: she yells at me because I mentioned the FF outfits.She starts yelling at me about how I'm too obsessed, and how I'm crazy and selfish, and not listening to my side of the story, and butchering my roots and my bonds, and generally making me look like the piece of dirt I probably look like to everyone else. She even said "I'm going to take you to a mental institution so you can see what it's going to be like."...</blockquote>
* Her mother and a classmate once wrote to Dr. Phil to seek help. It didn't push through, which only goes to show that not even Dr. Phil can help her.

[[Image:Even_dr._phil_says.jpg|thumb|right|Maybe that's why it didn't push through.]]

* She claims she [[bullshit|"reformed"]] several [[Final Fantasy]] villains and other villains as well, then turned them into her guardians. Even that mama's boy, [[Sephiroth]]. (What will [[Sephirothslave]] say about this?)
* She has a school phobia. She's so scared of going to school she thinks she might die young.
* [http://z13.invisionfree.com/MH_1_5/index.php?showtopic=639 SHE HAD ONCE HAD EVEN THE MOST MINISCULE SEMBLANCE OF SANITY.] But unfortunately it got lost into oblivion. 
* She says she doesn't like boys, sex, and the like, but secretly fantasizes about video game characters.
<blockquote>"This week's just been...awkward, and awful. And I feel like I've been being a bad girl this week, and very out-of-character. First of all on Tuesday I had an UNBELIEVABLY gross thought about my much-fangirled attendant Siegfried Schtauffen. And I spent the rest of the night wondering why the heck something like THAT would come to my Jun-Kazama-esque-pure-and-innocent mind."</blockquote>
* She also says Yuna's from Canada. [[wtf]]. More like in between US and Canada. Oh, and Kingdom Hearts too. But she says they're more like in Canada.
* She's never played most of the games she talks about.
* SHE HASN'T COMBED HER HAIR SINCE SHE WAS 7 WTF.
* She also has a 30 year old brother who got arrested for a sexual offense.
* Apparently, Star has a real, human friend (that actually exists and can interact with other people too). Only one though, who is also her [[obese|MASSIVE]] hugbox and cunt licker.
* For a while, she had an internet boyfriend. He LOOOOOOOOOOOVED to write imaginary stories where him and a few of their [[emo]] friends had orgies. Even he turned out not to like her. He was just pretending, like Xena/Star/Aurora/Donna pretends to lick Metroid's cunt every night. To some, this man turned into a hero, crushing the soul of a mighty dragon-fairy-vampire (she's an otherkin too guys). But it turns out this kid was just a [[faggot|whiny emo with MPD]] like Xena/Star/Aurora/Donna. As seen here in this preview of their romance novel:

{{quote|<small><small>"...'''Then I decided to take action when Xena's bullshit started pissing everybody off. Everybody liked it when I told off Xena. EXCEPT FOR YOUR BITCH ASS. NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR HER SHIT. NOBODY WANTS TO LISTEN TO Metroid, PHAAZE, SA-X, YUNA, LIGHTNING, KENDRA, ETC.''' What I did was a justice to this site. But you're the only whore who didn't like it. So you banned me to the Adachi forum. Why ban me, when I'm not the one who started this shit?

I give the site a few months before your idiocy kills the rest of the good in it. The axe that will cut down this faggot tree is coming. Have fun with all of the people on your site! You'll have tons like Yuna, Lightning, Metroid, Kendra, Heather, because Xena will be all of them for you! She'll even pretend to be other members too!"</small></small>|- Xena's white knight and EX boyfriend, '''Odd/K Nundrum'''}}
*Unknown to those people, there was apparently a [[bullshit|stalker]] claim issued by this [http://www.myspace.com/chrisphoenix man]. This man claims that someone from this [http://www.creepypasta.com/forums/index.php site] knows her physical address. Which was [[crap]] anyways. Funny how she firmly believed it.
*Since Donna got [[butthurt]] from being [[lulz|bullied]] on a site, she now tries to [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=wgo90iyyy9zlrzq27ft9tqqc&page=5 SPREAD THE WORD OF SOULBONDING ALL OVER THE INTERNETS].
*Being all [[butthurt]] from the drama she always attracts and brings upon herself, she has finally decided to leave said site where she gets [[pwned|"bullied"]]. On the [[TV Tropes]] forum, she tells people that the admin of the site (the one she left/will leave) is her best friend, and only stayed because of her, while saying on another post that the site is stupid/full of asses.
{{quote|Well, I just gave my friend on that Site Full-O-Jackasses her "I may be leaving so goodbye" PM and now I'm about to cry again.|some "best friend" you are, huh.}}
*[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=bo4zk3qiumga5g3cewwkqpr8&page=1 Someone finally snapped at her bullshit.]
*She likes to start debates or get into debates without having full knowledge about the topic, as seen [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=zl1ap99sc1s99kdx1veqwnwh&page=1 here]. Being a princess, she has all the money she needs to buy anything she wants, SO DOWNLOADING THINGS IS BAAAAD. But AMVs are absolutely acceptable, because she said so. Having logic and reason thrown into her in the aforementioned thread, she decided to stay away, since she's allergic to both.
*She also likes to defend obvious trolls. 
*Has it been mentioned that she's extremely [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=qrm3yj0ix7i72hxrfaytcbxm&page=3#62 delusional]?

*She's a closet lesbian. One can also notice she has a huge amount of female guardians and fewer male ones (who actually look more female than the real females, anyway; e.g. Cloud)
<pre>
XenaEilonwy: Okay so if there's a sex scene between Shepherd and Ashley
XenaEilonwy: What if Shepherd is a girl
XenaEilonwy: Tifa: ..Then there is no sex scene but there is a way you can be les with Liara
XenaEilonwy: IMPLIED THREESOME IN MASS EFFECT</pre>
*She has a fanfiction about [[Pedophilia|second graders]] who have a lesbian relationship and also says they have "[[sex|les yay!]]" but claims it's not sex whatsoever.

=How to troll her=

Tell her:

[[Image:Samuspron.jpg|thumb|right|This is probably what she does every night.]]
