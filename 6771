'''Rachel Marsden''' is a [[queening|dominatrix]], [[FFA]] (because of Jimbo's [[beer]] belly) and a [[insane|serial]] [[stalker]]. She also <strike>is</strike> was a newly hired host at [[Fox News]]. 

In 1996, Marsden proved the [[cybersex|power of the internet]] by sending her swimcoach porno emails.  Seeing as he replyed [[tits or gtfo]] and their school was on a [[Unix]] based system, and therefore no images existed at the time, she got [[butthurt]] and decided to say he [[lies|sexually harrassed him.]]  After he got fired, he made it public, made the emails public, and got his job back, proving that [[women]] are liars.  The fact that [[FOX News|FOX]] hired her later is proof they know a good liar when they see one.

In 2004 she pled guilty to [[pegging|criminal harassment]] and was given [[cunnilingus|probation]]. Her defense was that she [[did it for the lulz]]. This (among other annoying facts) caused problems when she got her own [[wikipedia]] article. People just kept putting the inconvenient stuff back in and Rachel kept taking it out.

So Rachel became the subject of one of the greatest [[revert]] wars in [[Wikipedia]]'s history, involving scores of admins. The fight reached up the chain until [[Jimbo]] [[White_Knighting|decided he had to get personally involved.]] [http://valleywag.com/362511/how-wikipedia-got-jimmy-wales-laid One thing] then led to another [http://valleywag.com/362374/wikipedia-founders-fling-with-fox-news-fox until she put out] to thank Jimbo for helping on the article.

Meanwhile, the [[wikipedo]]s had a massive [[Arbchat]] and decided that you couldn't write anything mean about anyone, ever. Pussies.

In July 2007, Fox News fired her bitch ass. The primary reason was that they found out she was really from Vancouver. This occurred during the daily Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, when someone noticed that she didn't seem to know all the words.

In 2008 [http://valleywag.com/362564/transcripts-of-wikipedia-founders-sex-chats the logs] of her and Jimbo talkin' dirty were leaked to some gossip site. [[Some argue]] that Rachel was the leaker.

On March 1, 2008, Marsden became the first woman in the history of the planet to be [http://valleywag.com/362730/wikipedia-creator-jimmy-wales-dumps-girlfriend-on-wikipedia dumped on wikipedia]. In ever-classy psychobitch style, Rachel retaliated by putting [http://valleywag.com/362772/wikipedia-guys-ex+girlfriend-auctions-his-clothes-on-ebay Jimbo's smelly garments up for sale on eBay]. Included in the sale is a [http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc171/jewishcuisine/82fe_1.jpg t-shirt smeared with Jimmyjuice].
