Now, this is a story all about how<br>
Tim's life got flipped-turned upside down<br>
And I liked to take a minute<br>
Its a matter of [[fact]]:<br>
He made a [[retarded]] show called Explosive Impact<br><br>

In Barrie, Ontario born and raised<br>
Gaia Online where he spent most of his days<br>
Screamin' out stutterin' out bein' a cunt<br>
And talkin' smack to hackers on the interbutt<br>
When a couple of guys<br>
Thought he went too far<br>
Startin' making fun of his avatar<br>
He got in one lil fight and called them "dicks"<br>
And the number of viruses amounted to 456.<br><br>

He bawled at the hackers and when they came near<br>
He stuttered, repeated himself, and looked like a queer<br>
If anything I can say: whats with this dude?<br>
But I was like 'Holy shit!! Now he's on Youtube!'<br><br>

He. Pulled. Out his nerd rage for 5:24<br>
And he yelled at the viewers like a little whore.<br>
I looked at his video<br>
The parodies were funny and cool<br>
The very next day, he shot up his school.
