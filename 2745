[[Evil]] Jacket Guy is a [[psychopath|scilon]] that works for the church of Scientology.  He is [[fact|also the evil twin of]] [[Wise Beard Man]], which you can easily note in the similarities of their appearance.

== Origins ==
[[Image:guy_has_a_gun.jpg|right|thumb|240px|And he's not afraid to discreetly flash it.]]Evil Jacket Guy was first spotted [[Last Thursday|last Thursday]] at the [[3/15|Protest of Scientology]], bearing a gun. It's unclear just how Evil Jacket Guy came to be, but [[shit_nobody_cares_about|sources say that he used to be an old teamster, and sold out Jimmy Hoffa and that's how he died]].  In addition, we firmly believe that in the final apocalyptic battle, Evil Jacket Guy will actually pull his piece and try and shoot Wise Beard Man in the beard, killing his body, but ultimately failing to kill the beard. The Beard will then fire a massive energy ray that will destroy the world, as well as Evil Jacket Guy.
