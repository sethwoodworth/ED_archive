A '''Talk page''' is a wiki contributor's best friend. Talk pages are great for explaining reasoning, having [[flame wars|conversations]] and giving well needed guidance, information and the such.

Lazy Wikipedians often use the Wikipedia talk pages to attempt to get other Wikipedians to add something to the article that they want in the article, but are too indolent to add themselves. A favorite of [[fake editor]]s.

99.9999987 % of the time these requests are completely ignored.

Examples ''(Real Wikipedia user page requests, modified to protect the slothful)'': 
 
:*Section only provides one view of the debate...The author provided their own interpretation of the events and [http://en.wikipedia:NPOV not a unbiased view]. Comments like something is "hard to understand" imply a position...Please revise this.
:*This article is biased and needs [[wikipedia:NPOV|NPOV]] correction. 
:*This article needs a picture
:*...link needed: Article lacks even a footnote citing....
:*The rumor that the (game (whether lost or otherwise)) was banned in Germany has been debunked by (this site). Therefore this needs to be changed or removed. ''(grammar and spelling corrected)''

== ED talk pages ==
Talk pages on [[ED]] should be used appropriately. User Talk pages should be used for conversing between users, be it reprimand, information or general conversation. Article Talk pages should be used for discussion of the article/topic itself, either while the article is protected or when requesting [[moar]].

== Talk page etiquette ==
*Users should always sign (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>) any comments they make. This should go at the end of the final word of your comment, for clarity.
*When replying to a comment, always use a <big><big>"  <nowiki> *</nowiki>  "</big></big> (an asterisk) to indent and keep talk pages readable.
*Add a new heading <nowiki>(== Title ==)</nowiki> for new topics being added to the talk page.
*Never remove someone else's comments or [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|blank]] talk pages. This is punishable by [[IN THE ASS|ass rape]].
*New headings go at the bottom of the talk page. New comments under an existing heading go at the bottom of that heading.
