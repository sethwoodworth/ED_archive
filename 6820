Buddy you’re a young man hard man<br>
Shoutin’ in the street gonna take on the world some day<br>
You got blood on yo’ face<br>
You big disgrace<br>
Wavin’ your banner all over the place<br>
<br>
We will we will RAC you<br>
We will we will RAC you<br>

You got mud on your face<br>
You big disgrace<br>
Somebody better put you back in your place<br>

Rant about cons is a [[LiveJournal]] community for discussion of [[Conservatism|stupid people]] in [[political communities]].  Membership in this community is currently moderated. Despite the name, the group occasionally discusses [[liberals]] as well as [[Conservatism|conservatives]].  They adore [[belt0033]], and such feelings are requisite to join.  Trolled by justgoto - but what isn't?

This community is moderated by a clique of the most [[histrionic]], knee-jerk whiners on LiveJournal. It's a place to make even the most bleeding-heart liberal begin to hate his or her own kind.

RAC is moderated by [[dancingdrew]], [[kamuela]], [[uncut_diamond]], [[poloemily]], [[imaybeparanoid]]cacahuate, and [[lancerboi]] who all told make up the cabal-within-a-cabal that is the RAC staff. In addition, RAC sometimes takes suggestions from [[paigegirl]], a founding member. Colintj is there too. Eh.

== How PoloEmily Fucked Up==

One day, [[badlydrawnjeff|badlydrawnjeff]] decided he was going to join RAC.  They accepted his request, but he couldn't actually view the community.  Luckily, he was able to open his [[friends]] page and see a classic [[mod]] alert:

<i><blockquote>Recently we have had an influx of membership requests from obvious "enemies".
I suggest mods do the following:
When a request to join a moderated community is approved or denied, the requestee recieves an a-mail notification.
They do not, however, recieve such a notification if they are removed from the community.
So, approve request, tehn immediately remove them.
they get the e-mail, get a moment of glee thinking they got in, and then...DENIED.
It's like getting your country club membership in the mail but the doorman can't find your name. It's beautiful.
(Wait...was I being to OMG conservative evil corporate elitist with that metaphor?) </blockquote></i>

== Rant_about_racs ==

A [[lame]]-[[ass]] counter-community designed to "make sure that the truth about these "people" comes out by using nonagresive ([[sic]]) means."  Sort of like Ditto cops, but without the maniacal energy.

==Wehateliberals==

[[puremisery]]'s response to [[rant_about_cons]].  Apparently titled as such because "wehateliberalism" has too many characters.

Most of the time is spent laughing at [[liberal]] buffoonery and the [[nazi]] practices of [[rant_about_cons]], and thereby they come off  sounding like the most [[Conservatism|bed wetting Baby Huey's]] ever.
