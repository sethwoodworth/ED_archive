'''[http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Ken_Redtail Ken Redtail]''' is a [[furry]] [[faggot]] and [[otherkin]] from the Chicago suburbs who is a member of the always drama-tastic Lake Area Furry Friends (LAFF) even though [[Mix_Hyena|no one in the group can stand him]]. He constantly invites himself to meet ups - even though no one wants him there. He can't ever seem to [[gtfo|take a hint]] and just makes everyone feel uncomfortable with his presence. He tries to make himself known in the furry fandom, but always fails horribly, although he does seem to have himself fooled:

      kaenraelin (6:07:39 PM): Eh, I've worked hard to build a reputation in the fandom.
      kaenraelin (6:07:47 PM): A good one.
      kaenraelin (6:08:23 PM): I'm an administrator on a major furry site and my name is
 wellknown in many places around the world
[[Image:Kenredtailisaretard.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of Ken IRL]]

As the chair of the Milfur committee at [[Anthrocon]], he is the Chief of Staff of the national furry armed forces against [[fursecution]]. 

==Birth of a Furfag==
Ken's involvement in furry can be traced back to when he used to use the name [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Chakat_Redtail Chakat Redtail]. [[Boytaur|Chakat]]s are [[hermaphrodite]] creatures and Ken thought he was one of these! Here is his old fursona:

[[Image:Chakat Redtail.jpg|thumb|400px|none|Yup, that's good artwork.]]

Well, according to [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Chakat_Redtail the wikifur article], Ken's lifemate is '''Chakat Angelwings''' (aka. '''Sylus Foxdragon''') and they had a [[roleplay]] lovechild named Mistletoe.  Well, it turns out [http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Sylus_Foxdragon Sylus Foxdragon] is a guy. 

      
      [02:25] kendricks_redtail: My original fursona reflected my personal choices in bisexuality
 and polyamory
      [02:25] m: >.> polyamory?
      [02:26] kendricks_redtail: Yes
      [02:26] kendricks_redtail: I've had various experiments with polyamory. You?
      [02:26] m: no.
      [02:27] kendricks_redtail: Never been an interest, huh?
      [02:27] m: not in the slightest. >.> im dedicated to just one.
      [02:27] kendricks_redtail: Its kinda hectic and I've really drawn away from it. My last
 run really ended in tears.
      [02:31] kendricks_redtail: ~shrugs and grins~
      [02:31] kendricks_redtail: its not like I had multiple mates
      [02:31] kendricks_redtail: I was one of the multiple mates, does that make sense?
      [02:32] m: no offense but i dont want to talk about polyamory

Now he has now adopted [[OVER 9000]] fursonas, his most popular is a Red Fox named Ken (how original). He blames his problems on his [[schizophrenia|alternate fursonas]] claiming that they were the ones who made him do something stupid. Ken never takes responsibility for his actions.

==Failure at Life ==
Ken joined the [[gay|United States Navy]] after failing out of both [[college|University of Wisconsin]] AND [[retard|College of DuPage]]. Despite having previous knee problems and mental disorders, he lied to the Navy and was able to enlist. There he became a culinary specialist, but barely ever cooked because he shipmates made him their bitch and had him clean their bathrooms. Ken was often to subject of a lot of ridicule while aboard the USS Enterprise, and was even beaten up while he was sleeping! Shipmates would steal his fuck [[plushie|plushies]] and wipe their asses with them, then return them to his bunk after Ken would throw a [[adult baby|temper tantrum.]] [[Image:DSC00026_640.jpg|thumb|right|Plushophilia at its finest!]]The abuse got so bad that Ken would [[hobosexual|sleep out in his smelly truck]] in the parking lot every night to avoid being beaten up. In 2006, Ken was discharged from the Navy for being too [[fat]], no seriously, it's not a joke! He was given several chances to pass his Physical Requirement Test which was as simple as running the mile in gym class and doing a few sit ups, but [[retard|failed it too many times.]] He was also considered far too overweight, and the Navy gave him several chances to lose to extra pounds, but his fat furry ass continued to eat out at [[shit|McDonald's]] and Sonic until he was so fat he couldn't even fit in the beds the Navy provided.


Here is further proof of Ken's failure at life from back in 2002. Note he still tries to contact the other person in this AIM conversation to this day. One would think he would get the idea to just /wrist but sadly, this is not the case. It is also known from this snippet that Ken believed being a furry was akin to Native American rituals.


      Dragon Tarot: nah, you just dress up in a mascot costume. Yup. That's not pathetic.. nooo
      kaen raelin: I only have connection to the fox so I may draw strength from his totem, much in the way a 
      shaman would dress as a buffalo to draw upon their magic, the way a roman would dress as a wolf to lead the legion
      kaen raelin: I look to the foxs totem, so I may gain wisdom, cunning and craftiness
      kaen raelin: So my mind will be sharper and I will have connection to the animal spirits
      kaen raelin: That is how I celebrate furry
      Dragon Tarot: let's not degrade the Native American rituals. You are not a shaman, never will be.
      Romans dressed as wolves for intimidation factor. The Scandinavians which were 6'6 on average were 
      terrified of the 5'5 Romans
      kaen raelin: No
      Dragon Tarot: *dies laughing* you celebrate something so pathetic as the word "Furrie"? For God's Sake!
      Go seek some professional counceling
      kaen raelin: Romans dressed as wolves to honor lupa
      kaen raelin: And to have her aid them in battle
      kaen raelin: Its deeply spiritual stuff, dear
      kaen raelin: Why are we arguing this?
      Dragon Tarot: *grin* right, nothing like making a cartoon deeply serious. Uh huh. Ayup. Sure twist
      ancient mythos into reality. Which lets just say, Rome fell now didn't it? Thousands of years ago too.. Hm.. gee.
      kaen raelin: Simply because you seek to mock me for choosing a spiritual path and totem and attributing 
      it to furry, something you know nothing about?
      kaen raelin: Every civilization falls
      Dragon Tarot: Being a furry wouldn't be all it's cracked up to be IRL.. I mean I sure as hell wouldn't want 
      pubes covering my entire body.. I mean I'd smell like a gigantic Italian man's ass all day.. mixed with the 
      decadent stench of animal BO
      Dragon Tarot: roflmfao, a cartoon is a spiritual path? my god. You really are fucked up aren't you?
      kaen raelin: You keep going back to cartoon
      kaen raelin: Where I say totem, you say cartoon
      kaen raelin: I don't get it
      Dragon Tarot: *grin* nothing like twisting popular culture and icons into something more "mystical" as a 
      way to justify yourself for wanting to escape reality
      kaen raelin: People do it all the time
      kaen raelin: But I miss where I fall into this?
      Dragon Tarot: *grin* dressing up in a mascot costume is pretty pathetic, its not revering ancient spirts.
      Its making a modern mockery of it all
      kaen raelin: Perhaps
      kaen raelin: Perhaps not
      kaen raelin: Who are you to judge?
      Dragon Tarot: *laughs* there's a difference between being judgemental and having a downright psycosis that 
      should be treated in an institution
      kaen raelin: We haven't even gotten in on people who use furry as an artform
      kaen raelin: So you're saying since you're not being judgemental, you're psychotic and should be treated
      in an institution
      Dragon Tarot: its not even an artform. Picaso was art, Luis Royo is art. A cartoon furry isn't art

==Ken+Love==

To think that something so ugly and with such a small penis could actually have a sex life is scary, but it does exist! 

Ken's earliest sexual experiences include jerking off and having his [[bestiality|beagle]], DJ, lick up the excess and calling sex hot lines and [[masturbation|jerking off]] to the voices over the phone.

[[Image:Kendrnotgay.jpg|thumb|[[Not gay]] at all]]
Unlike many of his furfag brethren, Ken is [[not gay]] but, he claims to be heterosexual and eschews the use of [[yiff]] art in his own personal drawings. However, due to the fact that he is a [[twink|super macho]] ex-[[faggot|Navy]] and a [[Republican]] who loves [[Jesus]], he is the furry fandom's largest closet case. Perhaps that is why he harbors such guilt and often leaves [[lj]] entries where he discusses [[quitting IRC forever|leaving the fandom]]. 

Ken claims that he is 100% straight, but those who know him closely know [http://img229.imageshack.us/img229/2803/imbilolmw5.jpg that's not true]! If the Chakat character wasn't enough of a dead give away - Ken has also had a sexual relationship with Hiromi Kitsune, a transsexual. "Romi" (aka Robert) was born a male but while Ken was dating him, he was having operations to become a female. Ken admitted to "testing out" Romi's "new parts" as he got them. He also admits to being a part of circle jerks with several other males while Romi paraded around in his fursuit. He lived with Romi part of the time while he was in the Navy but ended up cheating on him after he admitted to him that he was "too embarrassed" to introduce Romi to his parents. What a nice guy!

      [18:11] kaenraelin: You know I'm pretty straight, right? 
      [18:12] kaenraelin: What does it mean when I get burbly over beefcake? 
      [18:13] kaenraelin: Not like sexually excited 
      [18:13] kaenraelin: Just schoolgirl squealy 
      [18:13] Rayven Wolffe: Lol I dunno 
      [18:14] kaenraelin: And just the beef 
      [18:15] kaenraelin: Like 300 kind 
      [18:15] Rayven Wolffe: Huh? 
      [18:15] Rayven Wolffe: You lost me XD  
      [18:15] kaenraelin: Seen 300? 
      [18:15] Rayven Wolffe: No 
      [18:15] kaenraelin: Well 
      [18:15] kaenraelin: You've seen stills, right? 
      [18:16] kaenraelin: Pictures of the gorgeous bods? 
      [18:16] kaenraelin: I like me some hunks ;_;
            (IT MEANS YOU'RE A FLAMER, KEN!)

To try and cover up his homosexuality, Ken obsesses himself with many female furries. Married, engaged, dating, single, he doesn't care - Ken will tell any girl he's known for more than 5 minutes that he loves them and that they should [[its a trap|leave their current significant other for him.]] Ken has "fallen in [[love]]" with [http://rayvenwolffe.livejournal.com/143094.html every female furry that has been unfortunate enough to have crossed his path]. Ken's response was the same as it always is. He denied having ANYTHING to do with any of these girls. Then when they persisted and he started losing numbers on his friends list, he made a big public apology and expected everyone to forgive him. When they didn't he threatened to become [[an hero]]. After [[Pwned|being dumped for the second time while he was on cruise in the Navy]], Ken kept the engagement ring he gave to that girl and has used it to propose to over a dozen girls over the internet.
 
      No, we're no joking when we say over a dozen:

      -Rayven's two sisters
      -Wolff Slaven

      ...and so many more!



For instance, a log from two weeks after meeting a girl (who was dating someone at the time):
     Ken Redtail (1:03:44 AM): ~takes her by her cheeks and looks at her silently~
     Ken Redtail (1:04:25 AM): ~smiles and suddenly just kisses her~
     Sono (1:04:37 AM): *blink* o//o
     Ken Redtail (1:04:56 AM): ~holds until she breaks it~
     Sono (1:05:03 AM): *flail*
     Ken Redtail (1:05:27 AM): ~breaks it off and looks away embarassedly~
     Ken Redtail (1:05:35 AM): I'm sorry
     Sono (1:05:46 AM): ^^;;; that was... very unexpected.
     Ken Redtail (1:06:20 AM): Sorry, feeling impulsive and daring
     Sono (1:06:50 AM): Heh. We all have our moods. But I warn you, I already have a boy. ^^; 
     And I'd hate to see two very nice foxes have to fight.

The same girl had to endure [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Ken-ConfessLove.gif LiveJournal entries about her], all during June and July 2007. Some of them were made on the same day, and talked about [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Ken-InFrontOfABus.gif jumping in front of a bus]. Apparently, being in love will do that to you.
He loves her and he needs to tell the world! [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Ken-LoveVid.gif Or at least his entire LiveJournal].

But don't worry! Ken had moved on to a different obsession by August! He started telling people that she (his new obsession) was dating him, even though she lived in a different state with her REAL boyfriend. Needless to say, she wasn't too happy when she found out.


[[Image:Redtailrapist.jpg|thumb|right|Very flattering picture of Redtail's "[[penis|Foxhood]]" as he calls it...]]His [http://ken-redtail.livejournal.com/profile LiveJournal] is filled with emo whining and confessions of deepest love to his strictly platonic friends. He seems to be unaware of a difference between friendships and romantic relationships. He has made many [[rape|unwanted sexual advances]] on some of his real life female friends, including crawling into the bed of one while she was sleeping and touching her in a sexual way.

Ken has been said to have [[rape]]d someone in the past. When confronted with this accusation, Ken said:
     [14:41] kendricks_redtail: Just the fact that's flying around is upsetting me
     [14:41] kendricks_redtail: You see
     [14:41] kendricks_redtail: I've BEEN raped

Ken is a creepy motherfucker who has probably fucked [[your mom|your mother]], hence his title. He used to work as a security guard for Office Max...but he was fired October 05, 2007 for being a dirty looking bastard. He thought his job was [[serious business]] but all he did was make sure that nobody stole rubber bands. And, surprise, he even failed at that!

Like stated above, Ken is DIRTY. He smells so bad that people can't stand to be around him in real life, not even his "best friend".

     [21:46] Rayven Wolffe: Also, when was the last time you showered? I don't want to
 be mean, but you smell quite ripe.  
     [21:48] kaenraelin: 5 o clock? 
     [21:49] kaenraelin: Huh... 
     [21:49] Rayven Wolffe: Then perhaps you need a box of breathmints. That's why I moved
 from the table to the computer, and I could -still- smell it. You reek, man.  
     [21:50] kaenraelin: I don't know why 
     [21:51] Rayven Wolffe: Hygiene? Like I said, I dun wanna be mean, but maybe that's
 why some people don't like to hang out with you.  
     [21:51] Rayven Wolffe: Like, shower every morning, and brush twice a day with Listerine.  
     [21:52] kaenraelin: I shower sometimes 2-3 times hon 
     [21:53] Rayven Wolffe: Hey, I'm just telling you. You want people to be honest, 
 well I am. And don't call me hon, damnit.  
     [21:53] Rayven Wolffe: LISTEN when people tell you things. This is the 4th time I've
 had to tell you not to call me that.  
     [21:53] kaenraelin: I'm sorry. I'm still trying to break that habit 
     [21:54] Rayven Wolffe: You have bad b.o. sometimes. When we were dating the people
 who knew we were asked me to ask you to shower, you know that? If showering and teeth
 cleaning doesn;t help, go see a dermatologist or a dentist because something is very wrong. 

It is rumored that Ken wipes his ass with his hands - because that's what he smells like. Further observation suggests that he licks his fingers clean afterward.


[[Image:HOLYSHITKenRedtail.jpg|thumb|Too sexy for his hat!]]


Recently, [[over 9000]] of his female LiveJournal friends de-friended him for being a creepy, obsessed [[stalker]] who claimed to love them and begged them to run away with him. He also brought his creepy infatuations to a roleplaying community where he then fawned over one of his obsessions there in a role play setting, causing some tension and irritation.

== Mutiple User Name Disorder (MUND) ==

When people realized Ken was a compulsive liar and a complete retard, they started blocking him from AIM and from their LiveJournals. Ken being the stalker he is couldn't handle that and decided to create several alternative screen/user names so he could still keep tabs on these people. Ken admits he wont take anyone off his buddy list because when he sees them sign on, he "knows their okay"...riiiight, and that's not [[stalker|creepy]] at all. 

Speaking of creepy, why are almost all of the alternative usernames, [[shemale|"women"?]]

'''Known "secret" screen names of Ken Redtail:'''
*<s>{{lj|elaurianmystic}}</s> - created after he was BANHAMMERED from an ex's journal. He admits he still wanted to read her LJ because he was still in love with her. - '''BALEETED!'''
*{{lj|aesopwildcat}} ([http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/User:aesopwildcat also used on Wikifur]) - a journal created to mock an ex
*<s>{{lj|whitefootwolf61}}</s> - a journal created to tell people that certain local furries had STDs - '''BALEETED!'''
*{{lj|quinn_dragon}} ([http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/User:quinn_dragon also used on Wikifur]) - his most recent known made up LJ name.
*{{lj|weluvsema}} - Another one to mock an ex
*{{lj|laffdramallama}} - created because he is too much of a pussy to post his own LAFF Drama
*{{lj|laffdramallama2}} - created after the first one was banned from the {{ljcomm|laffDrama}} and {{ljcomm|lafflist}} LJ communities
*{{lj|the_laff_llama}} - created to post in {{ljcomm|lafflist}} after he was exposed as a total womanizer. This "person" begged for people to give him another chance.
*[http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/User:immortalwatcher immortalwatcher] (WikiFur) - created to vandalize another furry's WikiFur entry.
*[http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/User:LAFFur LAFFur] (WikiFur) - created to make edits on WikiFur without people knowing it was him who made them.
*[http://www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=pibble_9_9_9 pibble_9_9_9] ([[Neopets]]) PASSWORD: LISKAREDTAIL - We're not sure what his motive was for making this one, but the retard used his ex's email to register this account so she was sent a confirmation email. Liska Redtail is one of Ken's fuck plushies.

He also has a few names on this website to write and edit articles about [[Sema JayHawk]], [[Blazger]], Harli Raver and [[Vixen T. Fox]] but failed miserably at all of them. He was quickly found out and [[lulz]] ensued. 

       KNOWN [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] USERNAMES!
          -[[blazger]]
          -[[strangechap]]
          -[[FurryPoacher]]
          -[[ChronixWolgon]]
          -[[Hillzbillyboi]]
       You better believe there will be [[moar]]!

How to spot a Ken Redtail alternative LJ username:

*They are almost always women.
*The are almost always a member of {{ljcomm|lafflist}}
*They add a lot of Ken's LJ friends, many of which have no idea who the person is who added them.
*They "learn" how to create a Wikifur entry very quickly
*They almost always have a Yahoo email address and YIM screen name
*If you call him out in the LJ, your comment will be deleted with no reason as to why
*If several people call him out in the LJ - then the journal will get deleted or the user will become very offended and start banhammering people.

Ken is known to play the pity card. He claims to be [[suicidal]] so that people will feel bad for him and give him [[sex|what he wants]]. He is a coward and runs away when he has been caught in a lie or when the husband of one of the girls he "loves" finds out about him being a creepy stalker.

==Ken on [[WikiFur]]==
Ken is an administrator on [[Wikifur]] along with his [[buttsecks|butt buddy]] and head administrator, [[GreenRaeper]]. He got this position because he spent countless hours updating furries' articles because, like his mother, he thinks he knows everything about the furry fandom. In fact, Ken Redtail is now the [http://wikistats.wikia.com/wikistats/EN/TablesWikiaFURRY.htm#wikipedians third highest contributor] to this dramatastic website. It was because of this, and the hundreds of dollars that Ken "donated" to Wikifur that GreenRaeper made him administrator, well that and because he's in love with him. Ken is so vain that he created other usernames to vote himself "Featured Article of the Week" on that website. Who thinks he should be featured article on this website as well? Ken being an administrator on that website also gives him total authority to revert any changes made to his article, even if they are true, to make him appear perfect in his article, hence why THIS article needed to be written.

==Ken Redtail vs. [[SomethingAwful]]==
Ken was booted off the [[SomethingAwful]] forums after being a goon for defending furries and admitting his [[furry]] status. He got on his [[lj]] then to [[baw|baaaaawwwww]] about how he was being fursecuted, and that he was proud of being a furry and that if [[SomethingAwful]] was [[bullshit|so prejudiced against him and his kind]], he didn't want to be a part of it anyway. However, his [[butthurt]] was poorly masked and was characteristic of his generally [[emo]] entries.  

==Gaming==
Ken's furfaggotry extends, naturally, into ''[[Second Life]]''. Keeping with his [[dying alone|squeaky clean]] image there's no [[bestiality|fox fucking]] at Rainbow Tiger for Ken. Instead, he plays ''Second Life'' as a [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|dragon]] where he is some sort of ruling member of "Second Life's number one Dragon community," the High Council of Wyrms. If you see him on ''Second Life'', please troll the fuck out of him.
[[Image:BrewfestLevel8Tauren.jpg|thumb|left|Creepy Sniveling Cow]]
Like every other Furry on the ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', Ken plays as a "Tauren named Oddfellow" pictured below. He has most recently been seen trying to seduce the ladies on the US Moon Guard ''[[role-playing]]'' server, despite it being common knowledge that they are all actually men. It is suggested that you form a [[mantrain]] behind him at your own risk. 

Ken also plays [[Neopets]]. That alone should send up red flags.

==Ken's Parents== 
Perhaps the most [[lol|disturbing]] thing about Ken Redtail is the fact that his parents are also into the [[furry]]/[[otherkin]] scene. That's right. His middle-aged parents have adopted [[fursona]]s and endorse their son running around with other [[sick fucks]] wearing [[babyfur|diapers]] and sporting erections dripping with pre-cum. Although their vanity wikifur articles claim that their son introduced them to the anthro lifestyle, it was actually [http://img296.imageshack.us/img296/8540/parentsyk0.jpg his over protective mother who found his live journal and discovered that her son was a fag]. Unlike his Dad, his Mother has been attending furry conventions. Is there no sadder thing then you going with your mom to a furry convention??  Am I right?  It's even sadder than him telling everyone his mom is dying of cancer so he can obtain free [[pr0n|art]].

[[Image:Kensmom.jpg|thumb|Ken's mom, [[srsly]].]]
For the record, his mother's [[fursona]] is Karee Bunda, a [[what|rabbit-panda]] hybrid while Ken's father is [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|Arigon the Golfing Dragon]], who is, as his name implies, a golfing dragon. This proves that even dragons can be middle-class suburbanites with [[boring]] hobbies. Shine on, you [[crazy]] diamonds!

Ken and his dad were recently spotted together making a scene at a Red Robin restaurant. Apparently the waitress wasn't moving fast enough for them. Further observation shows that Ken and his dad ordered everything on the menu, twice, and the kitchen could just not keep up. Judging by the size of Ken, it's suspected that if he doesn't eat every fifteen minutes on the dot, he will implode - or just throw a giant temper tantrum. 

==Testimonials==

"''I got on [[World_of_Warcraft|WoW]] to dick around a little bit. He started whispering me, so I /ignore'd him. What did he do? He came to the city I was in, found me, and started /saying things to me. I hopped on my mount and ran the fuck away from him. IRL stalking is one thing, but when you're being followed around by a creepy cow that's sniveling 'wait I love you lets [[Cyber|talk]]' that's a totally different story. D:''"



"''So... so far I know 8 girls who have been terrorized by him.''"



"''This disturbs me.''"



"''I've cut him loose as well. I want no more to do with him. I on my own am a mountain of proof. I have at least 4 months of logs of his behavior, and a couple of screencaps. I'm feeling harassed, abused, and used by him and that is not treatment I take lightly.'' 
''Especially not from so called friends.''" - {{ljuser|sono_cat}} 



"''...and apparently he's been involved in a [[rape]]. And has physically assaulted a girl that has that one disease that makes her incredibly fragile that even a poke can cause a bad bruise. ^^; And his navy discharge was dishonorable for some reason, why I didn't find out. But man, a lot of people in Illinois have some mad stories about him.''"


[[Image:KenEmoLJPost.jpg|thumb|right|The LiveJournal Post]]
"''What convinced me that hes a [[psychopath]] is where he's saying, in that other thread, that he didn't know about xainy's dog dying. And yet xainy knows he did, and can probably provide us with logs to prove it even. But he's still insisting. It's a classic characteristic of the psychopath, that they'll insist on their manipulative, 'I'm the good guy here' version of reality, even when somebody can prove them wrong.''"


"''Ken-
''you are a creepy douche. Get the fuck out.''"


"''Oh boy. He's THAT [[emo]]? He's posted a "tell me why you hate me" entry? Ha ha ha ha ha! That's [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] worthy, almost. *giggles*''" 

Well, we thought so, too!

==NO FURVERTS PLZ==

If you want to keep Ken away from you (and if you don't, you're probably him), use this image:

==Racism==

Like all [[fags]], Kendricks haets black persons. When asked why he's no longer in the navy he replied with this:


     kaen raelin (10:01:07 PM): There's just so much politics and sexism and racism
     kaen raelin (10:01:18 PM): I'm a white guy
     kaen raelin (10:01:29 PM): So I got 2 strikes already against me

Because we all know that [[blacks]] get farther in the military...

     kaen raelin (10:03:16 PM): Ya gotta be a brutha!
     kaen raelin (10:03:30 PM): Word to my g, black persons stick togetha!
     kaen raelin (10:03:59 PM): That's how it is
     kaen raelin (10:04:41 PM): If your supe is black, he's gonna take care of his homies first
     kaen raelin (10:04:49 PM): Except
     kaen raelin (10:04:54 PM): If you're a chick

[[Some argue|We all know]] that [[niggers]] [[fail]] at everything but picking cotton, smoking weed and [[rape|raping]] white women to get very far in life and the military.

==Art Whore==

Ken loves for furry artists to draw him. He has an entire [[FurAffinity]] [http://www.furaffinity.net/user/redtales/ gallery] dedicated to fan art of his characters.
He denies ever dropping hints or asking for free art in his life, but we have chat logs as proof.

     Sono (8:53:37 AM): I'm also on a horrendous art block.
     Ken Redtail (8:53:56 AM): Draw me.
A different time:
     Sono (12:51:07 AM): ^^ *sketches, stll trying to break through that art block*
     Ken Redtail (12:51:34 AM): ~thinks you should sketch me~

Also, to exhibit that he can't keep it in his pants and ALSO loves free art: Bonus conversation between Ken and Sono:

     Ken Redtail (12:50:05 AM): I am in need of an artist
     Ken Redtail (12:50:20 AM): But I should probably pay you money one of these days
     Ken Redtail (12:50:29 AM): XD
     Sono (12:50:41 AM): ^^;; Money is good for Sono especially since she's broke.
     Ken Redtail (12:51:18 AM): Will you accept sexual favors in lieu of cash?
     Sono (12:51:30 AM): XD Sadly no.
     Sono (12:51:41 AM): XD Those dont buy me food and supplies.
     Ken Redtail (12:52:02 AM): Dern
     Ken Redtail (12:52:22 AM): What about sexual favors and cash? XD
     Sono (12:52:46 AM): XD I'd prefer just the cash.
     Ken Redtail (12:52:57 AM): All right, all right
     Ken Redtail (12:54:00 AM): Is cool, I'm trying to get a con badge for a friend as a gift
     Sono (12:54:25 AM): Ah. ^^ I do badges pretty cheap.
     Ken Redtail (12:54:35 AM): $0?


     kaen raelin (10:27:45 PM): You tell a furry you're an artist and it puts you in a higher
 class than them.
     kaen raelin (10:27:50 PM): Don't you notice that?
     m (10:28:21 PM): i hadnt noticed that, no
     kaen raelin (10:29:32 PM): Its like an artisan class, they're a class above the common
 peasant class, just like in any feudal society

Because drawing [[fail | bad fox porn]] makes you the total equivalent of a medieval lord! Nay, you peasants, be gone from my yiffing chambers and fetch me my [[Plushie| plushie!]] Then again, Ken's art would be considered right on par with that of an [[Asperger's Syndrome | aspie.]] Which is probably why he tries so hard to swap [[rape | sexual favors]] for free arts.

[[Image:Redtailtotems.jpg|thumb|right|All of Ken's fursonas in a orgy with Ken spreading so his genitals would show! Yet strangely he goes and tries to nonchallantly cover them up whereas most normal furry art would want show them off proudly.]]

He's done things like this to several other artists over the course of his long career as a furry. If you have screenshots or logs of him doing it to you, please contribute to the lulz.

==PurpleOtterLulz==
Ken made a LiveJournal community called <s>{{ljcomm|PurpleOtterLulz}}</s> '''(lol baleeted)''' that was dedicated to posting lulz and fun about [[Prince Jeremy]]. A few on his friends list saw this as beating old meme with a dead horse and made public entries scorning those who created and/or joined it. Coincidentally, those people were also the people who were first to flame The Duke a year ago when it was popular.

As is his custom, Ken automatically pussed out, leaving his community child in the hands of {{ljuser|unsolvedsuicide}} and {{ljuser|harli_raver}}. Neither were very pleased with this.

He then made an [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:KenIdiot.gif apology post] and [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:KenHypocracy.gif commented in] {{ljuser|sono_cat}}'s LJ making her look like the bad guy. Some friend!

As it turns out, Ken's [[friends only]] [[LiveJournal]] entries reveal that he is actually jealous of the notoriety that [[Prince Jeremy]] has attained in the furry fandom. 

==Leaving the intarwebz forever==

On August 14th 2009, a post was made on {{ljcomm|furrydrama_2}} about Ken. It contains 63 comments of Ken-bashing, and eventually Ken found the post. He begged his [[BFF]] Rayven Wolffe to defend him, but she promptly kicked his fat ass to the curb. How could she defend him when all the accusations and stories in the post were true? After that, Ken made a vague, emo, locked post on his LiveJournal and has not updated it since. Sources say he has also been absent from his other online accounts such as [[facebook]] and [[wikifur]]. Those who know Ken well know that he could never just give up his intarwebz just like that, so the question remains; where is he really? Scenario One: He's hanging by his neck in his fucking closet. Scenario Two: He's assumed a new identity and is continuing to be a [[fail|failure at life]].


UPDATE!  Ken has resurfaced in Doctor Who fandom on LJ under the name *{{lj|ren-geek| ren_geek}} where he continues to be a drama queen and generally behave as a giant douche.
