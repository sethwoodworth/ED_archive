'''Elvis Aryan Presley''' <strike>is</strike> was an [[IRL]] singer, former [[Army]] soldier, and ([[fatass|fat]])[[ass]] man. He became [[famous]] by enlisting at [[Fort Hood]], which he then used as a platform to start a music career parodying [[black people]]. Like all [[Rock]] stars, he fucked [[Your Mom|many women]] and did lots of [[drugs]].  He later tried to have The Beatles banned from the [[Jewnited States]] because they were hogging all the good pussy. After his wife, [[Bitch|Priscilla Presley]], took half his [[stuff]] and converted to [[Scientology]], he [[overdose]]d on [[barbiturate]]s and [[HNNNNNNGGGGG]]ed on the [[shitter]] so Priscilla could not take the other half of his stuff.

Or so most have been led to believe...

==[[Trolling IRL]]==

It is [[common knowledge]] that "[[The King]]" ODed on the [[toilet|throne]] and has been [[Dead|grave dust]] since [[at least 100 years ago|1977]], yet [[some argue|some believe]] that he is still alive and occasionally appears at random [[Waffle House|diners and truck stops]], but these are often disproven as just wannabe Elvis impersonators.

Various [[theories]] have arisen over the years:

* He faked his death so his ex-wife would stop bitchin' at him for all his money and currently lives in an [[Retired]]ment home in East [[Texas]], fighting [[zombie|mummies]] with [[John F. Kennedy]] who is disguised as a [[negro]] ([[Elvis Presley#Elvis Discovered|see below]]).
* [[I did it for the lulz|He did it for the]] [[insurance]].
* He needed to avoid [[Mafia|certain people]] and make some debt go away.
* He got tired of fame on [[Earth]] and returned to his [[alien|home planet]].
* His [[ghost|spirit]] remains restless.

Even if he didn't die when everyone said he did, he would have surely dropped dead when his daughter married [[Michael Jackson]].

==Elvis Discovered==

Don Coscarelli's 2002 film ''Bubba Ho-Tep'' was in [[fact]] a documentary composed after years of searching a trail of clues and eyewitness accounts, particularly the written testimony of Joe R. Lansdale. [[DNA]] [[The Burden of Proof|evidence has proven]] that Elvis is indeed living in a [[Hell|retirement home]] in an undisclosed location in [[Dallas|East Texas]], along with a black person [[Insane|who is merely under the impression that he is in fact former president Kennedy]]. Unlike Elvis, however, JFK is without a doubt dead and gone as it is impossible to fake your brain splattering out all over your motorcade.

Due to the film's limited exposure, however, it is still widely assumed that [[fact|the King is dead]].
