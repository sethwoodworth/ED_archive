Ever find yourself in an argument with a fellow [[basement dweller|decent god-fearing citizen of the Internets]] on [[IRC]], [[TOW]], or a news site comment page? If [[you]] have, you definitely have been subject to a phenomenon known as '''Questionable Logic'''.  

Practitioners of this fast growing alternative to critical thought can be identified by their [[college|supercilious, bureaucratic tone, their ever-present air of smugness, and the verbose, long-winded manner with which they carry on "conversations."]] Armed with a spell checker, a thesaurus, and a year and a half of community college, these warriors of the web are fully equipped to fill their [[tl;dr|run-on sentences]] with words like <i>dynamic</i>, <i>zeitgeist</i>,and <i>portmanteau</i>, to attempt to sound smarter than you.

At best these half-assed attempts at logic are misguided. At worst, they are so far from the mark that a [[retard]] would blink a few times then call [[bullshit]]. You know it's sad when [[aspies]] and [[retards]] are better at logic than a "normal" person is.

'''You:''' I don't like <i>[[You|x]]</i><br>
'''Guy:''' Really? That's interesting.<br>
'''Guy:''' Because I think if you take a closer look at the [[lol wut|subcutaneous intricacies]] of the matter, you will see that your opinion cannot survive long under the rigors of intelligent debate without adapting to a more reasonable facet of understanding.<br>
'''Guy:''' Let me explain.<br>
'''Guy:''' You see, I like <i>x</i><br>
'''You:''' (bbscript-m386.http.ca.comcast.com) Quit<br>
'''Guy:''' [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|People like me.]]<br>
'''Guy:''' People are right.<br>
'''Guy:''' Furthertherewhereforemore, you should like <i>x</i>.<br>
'''Guy:''' Ah the cut and thrust of academia, it's not for everyone.<br>

''OR''

If A, then B

If B, maybe A

B > A

Sometimes B = A

Therefore, C ≅ 98°

==A few purveyors of Questionable Logic==
In the pursuit of creative interpretations of logic, there are a few groups that always stand out from the crowd. Their [[NO U|especially sharp rhetoric]], [[Verbose Thread|very verbose vocabulary]], and lack of common sense that makes retards look damn intelligent mark them as the some of the best of the worst when it comes to questionable logic. 

This is not an exhaustive list. There are always more where these came from.

===Furries===
No other group but the [[furries]] can boast the claims that fapping to animals is not [[bestiality]], pictures of children having sex is not [[pedophilia]], and that a [[fetish]] is actually a lifestyle. When not cranking out shitty [[MS Paint]] porn, furries spend their time drooling over their thesauruses in order to try to convince each other they are smart or getting into full-blown [[masturbation|wank-fests]] over their favorite [[art]]ists.

'''Abridged Examples of failed logic'''
*[[Softpaw Magazine|Cub art]] is [[pedophilia|freedom of speech]]
*Fursecution violates [[Godwin's Law]]
*It's [[no]]t bestiality!

===DevianTartlets===
The [[BAWWWWW|fine fags]] of [[deviantArt]] spend all their time tracing eachother's shitty artwork, playing with [[lense flare]], and claiming they are "real artists". Point out their poor anatomy, obvious tracing, or even just that they may be wrong and watch the fun begin!

'''Abridged Examples of failed logic'''
*I'm a good artist [[Snapesnogger|because I have fans]]
*It's not a trace if you [[traced|flip, recolor, and add cat ears]]!
*You aren't me so you [[prep|have no idea how hard my life is]]! Thus I'm right and you're not.

===Christians===
According to [[Christians]] an invisible being created the world in six days from nothing, his [[Satan|former best bud]] is now the root of all evil, and a Jewish [[Jesus|zombie that was his own father]] will save us all. Makes perfect sense!

'''Abridged Examples of failed logic'''
*Condoms are evil because they prevent [[STD]]s and [[pregnancy]]
*One being can hear all the world [[lolwut|whispering to him all at once]]
*You will totally [[zombie|come back from the dead]] someday and live in paradise

===Athiests===
[[Athiests]] [[Lie|may be saner]] than the religious nutjobs, but they are not immune to questionable logic. They usually carry a thesaurus around for looking up [[pretentiousness|smart sounding]] synonyms for words like "the" to appear [[stupid|smarter]] then they really are.

'''Abridged Examples of failed logic'''
* The universe was created when [[divide by zero|nothing exploded into everything]]
* I'm right because I went to [[college]]
* You believe in [[God|invisible men]], you [[Albert Einstein|can't have any idea]] how[[Bill Nye| to think logically]]


== Protecting Yourself ==
The only 100% effective way to make sure you are not swayed by these harpies' smooth sounding rhetoric on such important topics as The [[2008]] United States Presidential Election, [[Global Warming]], and [[Internet Law]] is to abstain from communication completely. Alternately, you can try not being an impressionable [[fucktard]] (Warning, PRO-level only). However, there are a few telltale signs you might be speaking to someone who has invented their own system of logic and has neglected to mention their use of it in place of yours. A look at the lineup in their arsenal of bullshit:

Key words/phrases
* Furthermore
* Let's be objective
* No, your logic is flawed
* Rationally speaking
* Thus
* Wrong

Key forums
* [[FOX News]]
* [[God Hates Fags]]
* [[Keith Olbermann]]
* [[The View]]
* [[Wikipedia]]

If, while talking to someone on the internet, they sound smart after one or two sentences, it is usually safe to say they they are preempting their barrage of questionable logic with some [[copypasta]] they overheard on [[lulzcast|public radio]]. If you are unsure, find the longest word in the copypasta and ask them what it means. Sign off/quit IRC/go [[fap]] before they have a chance to google it.
