Dangerous Kitten
{{FactAlert|This is serious shit and has been known to cause drama and IRL [[Banhammer|Ban Hammers]]. Actually using this might get you [[Partyvan|v&]]. The information on page is provided for entertainment purposes only.}}

[[Image:Dangerous cat.jpg|right]]'''Dangerous Kitten''' got its name from how it was originally spread - a [[rar]] embedded in a [[JPEG|jpg]] with the picture of a kitten in a hand, and the subtitle "It's dangerous to go alone, take this". It is a set of trolling tools.

The phrase was originally used in the first appearance of Link in "The Legend of Zelda" on NES.

==The /i/Kit==

Largely based on Dangerous Kitten, the /i/kit is an all in one package that can be loaded on to a USB drive (or a CD if you like lag) for anonymous to use for raids, haxzorin and lulz.

This kit is perfect for libraries, Cafes, "friends" houses, and any computer you don't own. You're in, you raid, you're out...and no one's really the wiser
