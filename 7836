'''Stiletto Null''' (Frank Chen), also known as '''Stiletto One''', was a prolific poster on several internet communities, including [[Something Awful]], [[DeviantArt]], [[LiveJournal]], and [[Wikipedia]]. On the afternoon of Sunday, February 11th, 2007, he was found by police in his car on a beach in North Carolina, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Given the great extent of his participation in numerous communities, Stiletto Null was involved in a remarkably-small amount of drama and was well-liked in general.

== Firearms ==

Stiletto Null was an enthusiastic and responsible firearms owner. He repeatedly demonstrated a substantial knowledge of maintenance and modifications related to military-surplus weapons, and was well-respected on the Something Awful guns subforum.

== Frustrated love life ==
Though he was able to acquire guns easily, there was one thing missing from his life that he could never buy: a [[woman]]. The only thing he could attract was a single [[homosexual]].  So [[Pervert|why does he have so many pictures of chicks]] in his photobucket?

== Suicide ==

== Note on LiveJournal ==

Stiletto Null gave no indication that he was suicidal or even depressed, and posted on IRC and SA hours before he took his life, as if nothing was wrong. 

{{squote|The past 14 months have been a more or less continuous withering away of my connections to my own life. At this point, I'm not sure of my own sanity anymore. I could probably work my way through it all (patience, eh?), but I just don't have any good reasons (or excuses?) to bother. I don't feel like I'd be particularly missed, and I don't feel like anything in particular matters anyway. I'm replaceable.|Stiletto Null}}

After Stiletto Null's death, Something Awful posters began to make memorial image macros commemorating his presence on the forums. One slogan, "R.I.P Stiletto Null: No one knew how to roll with the punches quite like you" was frequently juxtaposed over a pile of ammunition. This led to much derision by [[SASS]] posters because, quite obviously, [[Irony|anyone who hasn't committed suicide knows how to roll with the punches better than Stiletto Null]].
