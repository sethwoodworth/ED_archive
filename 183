A hunter shoots a bear
[[File:Tipp-Ex Mini Pocket Mouse.png|240px|right|KINDLY BROUGHT TO YOU BY OUR PROUD SPONSOR]]
'''A hunter shoots a bear''' is a [[Advertising|viral ad]] campaign created by the Tipp-ex / BIC company to promote their range of products designed to fix the spelling mistakes of [[13-year-old boy]]s and [[art]] students. It's less like a commercial and more like one of those terrible, shitty FMV point and click games that no one cared about 15 years ago. But this one is asking you to buy something you don't need, so within a couple weeks the videos amassed [[Over 9000|over nine million views]]. 

You read that correctly. In over nine million instances, people voluntarily watched a commercial. For god damned Tipp-ex (or, as [[Americunts|human beings]] refer to it, Wite Out). If that doesn't prove to you that people are too stupid for their own good and need to be left out in the elements like retarded Spartan babies to either die or come back stronger and smarter, than I don't know what else I can do for you.

==In case you're too stupid to even watch it, here's a synopsis!==

The ads begin with a hunter and a [[bear]] and at the end of the first video you are asked to choose whether you'd like to see the hunter shoot the wretched bear or whether you'd prefer to let it live. Your decision then diverts you to the next video, where you are asked to [literally] fill in the blanks. If you are bored at [[work]], then this shit is for you.

==Oh hell, just watch the fucking thing. You know your retarded ass is going to anyways.==
