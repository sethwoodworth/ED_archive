Concession

'''Concession''' is a [[shitty]] [[furfag]] [[webcomic]] that's drawn and written by massive furfaggot Immelmann. It begins with a basic premise about how shitty it is to work at a movie theater and somehow it ends up being about [[LOLWUT|demonic powers, spirits, rape, incest, mind control, crossdressing, branding and supervillains.]]


== The Author ==
[[Image:ImmelmannDrawingOfHimself.jpg|thumb|This is Immelmann's [[Lie|accurate]] self-portrait]]
[[Image:ImmelmannAndQuetzaDrake.jpg|thumb|[[Fact|This is how he really looks]] (on the right, dumbass).]]
'''Immelmann''' is the pretentious furfag who creates this garbage. He's fat (and suffers from [[Fat Artist Syndrome]]), greasy-looking, has a raging [[neckbeard]], self-inserts into every other comic and generally is a [[sickfuck]]. In addition to Concession, he created two other webcomics with shittier art (as if that was possible, [[amirite]]?). These are '''At the Heart of it All''', which is a giant [[emo]] bitchfest, and '''Ballerina Mafia''', which is just random [[shit]].

He also hosts another shitty furfag webcomic drawn by his [[fag|buttbuddy]] '''QuetzaDrake'''.

Not much of a [[lol-cow|LOLcow]], but great [[lulz]] and [[RAGE]] may be derived from his sickfuckery.

== The Cast ==

* Joel Calley - Black wolf who serves as the author's second-most-obvious self-insert. Dangerously skinny and a wanna-be rebel, he [[trolls]] the other characters and tries to turn everyone [[gay]]. He's also got spirit demon powers as a result of his dead sister's angst, or something. It's revealed at the end of the comic that [[Duh|Joel is crazy]].

* Matthew Gein - A cat who begins the comic as a God-fearing [[Christfag]] and by its end has become a [[gay]] [[trap]] who gets a boner over [[BDSM]]. Also magically discovers he too has spirit powers or something near the end. Often the object of [[fanservice]] for Concession's creepy [[fantards]].

* Artimus Crowley - A mouse who has brain cancer, that mysteriously never progresses or affects him in any fucking way. It's revealed that [[Jews did WTC|Joel did Artie's Cancer]], using his weird powers or some such shit. Notable for being one of the only straight guys in the entire comic. That was too normal for the [[furfag]] audience, so the author [[Pedophile|made him have sex with a 10 year old crossdressing sheep boy]].

* Immelmann - In addition to using Joel as a representation of his opinions, the author himself appears throughout the comic, even so far as appearing in a minor story arc as a full character. Turns out he's a hallucination or something, but [[noone]] cares. Always drawn skinny and often cutesy, despite his neckbearded jelly-rolls occupying the entire state of Massachusetts. 

* There's a shit-ton more, just go check the fucking [http://www.concessioncomic.com/cast.php cast page], you lazy fuck.
