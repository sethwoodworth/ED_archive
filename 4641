Koreaboo
[[Image:Shiny Beluga.jpg|thumb|This bitch had to settle for Korean instead of Japanese.]]

Koreaboos are the Korean version of [[Weeaboos]].  This situation is ironic as most people in [[Korea]] absolutely hate anything and everything American.  Koreans are among the most xenophobic people on earth, and a Korean man's greatest fear is his sister becoming romantically involved with a white guy, or even worse, a [[negro]].  Furthermore, the entire concept of Koreaboo makes no sense, as everyone knows that the Koreans have no culture of their own.  Koreaboo are attempting to steal a culture from Korea that was stolen from the [[Japan|Japs]], and before them the [[Chinese]], who suck, so the entire enterprise is pointless. Most Koreaboo can be found on crunchyroll, and thankfully that's one of the only places on the internet where large masses can be found. Many Koreaboos are also [[Weeaboos]] doubling the faggotry. This article is very short because no one wants to be Korean.
