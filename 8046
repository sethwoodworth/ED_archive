[[Image:How 2 Tbag.gif|thumb|300px|Even [[CNN]] knows how to Teabag]]

'''"Teabagging"''' ''(Also known as '''T-bagging''')'' is possibly one of the most overused way to generate [[lulz]] after killing or getting [[noob|killed]] within a [[Video games|videogame]]. Its so old that its [[unfunny|not funny anymore]]. Seriously: Only [[13-year-old boy| 13 year olds]] find it funny. Most people also teabag because they are most likely [[gay]]. The action often occurs on games like Gaylo, Cock of Duty, Gears of Gayness, and sometimes even on Roller Coaster Tycoon. Most the time, players do this as they are to pussy to say anything, and the only insult they know is to teabag. Tea bagging is not to be confused with what those damn brits use. 

== Definition ==
{{Quote| Teabagging is a slang term for the act of a man placing his scrotum in the mouth and on or around the face (including the top of the head) of another person, often in a repeated in-and-out motion. The practice resembles dipping a tea bag into a cup of tea.| [[TOW]]}}

== History ==
Teabagging started when the first [[faggot]] used it and thought it was funny. Nobody knows when It was first used but it was probably in [[Halo]], as the possible mixture of multiplayer, crouching, and a camera that fixed your corpse after getting [[Pwned]] but there are older games that may have had these. Though some suggest that there is evidence that Teabagging may have first occurred thousands of years ago, invented by the first [[you|fag]]. Regardless, this act of [[IRL]] [[fag|faggotry]] has found its way into videogames.

== How to Teabag ==

Before you perform this ritual, make sure the game supports the following features:

*Repeated crouching
*A fixed camera on your dead corpse
*Mutliplayer ''(Needed for [[lulz]])''

Boot the game up and proceed with the following:

#Kill another player
#Stand over their corpse ''(Line your groin up with their head)''
#Crouch
#Stand up
#Repeat steps 3 and 4 repeatedly and rapidly until the victim respawns
#[[????]]
#[[PROFIT]]

===[[IRL]]===
Same as above but 1 is optional and 5 does not include the end.

===Note===
Most teabags can also technically be considered as [[fail]]. This is because most people have their pants on, thus not rubbing the [[ball|sack]] on the face. But if you DO go so far as to do take your garments off for this, you're seriously [[gay]].

== Teabagging in [[videogames]] ==

Seriously, what retard that plays [[Halo]] hasn't been teabagged? Simply playing the damn game tells us that [[asking for it| your asking for it]]. Playing online in many videogames on the [[xbox 360|Eecks Bawks 360]] and [[Playstation 3|Gaystation 3]] will eventually make you fall victim. Face it, its bound to happen and has the potential to kill [[moar]] people then [[Fact|AIDS and Cancer]]. If you have not been teabagged, then someone in your game has not thought of doing it yet, but it will happen eventually unless not possible (see above). PC gamers aren't safe either, [[World of Warcraft| WoW]] faggots have also adopted to the ritual, as well as other online games such as [[Counter Strike]] and other Online adaptions. Face it, play online and you run the risk of getting bagged...
