The Great Chan Death of January 2007
Around late-January [[2007]], a sudden [[AIDS]] epidemic overwhelmed many popular 'chan' communities causing many of them to go offline and leaving many [[/b/tards]] bewildered and lost among the mass of [[tubes|internet]].

== [[4chan]] ==
Yotsuba Channel (as of 27th January) is offline<br/> due to a power failure:<br/>
<pre>[1/27 14:55:28] * moots changes topic to '4chan | oh no power failure | everybody dies'</pre><br/>
'''Status:''' Timing out.


== [[420chan]] ==

420 was already under massive scrutiny by its host as it was the same host used by 12chan. A [[CP]] image was posted on the [[lolicon]] board and the host decided that this was a valid enough reason to kick them off their servers. It came back relatively quickly, but with only two boards fully operational ([[b/|/b/]] and [[i/|/i/]])<br/>

== [[12chan]] ==

12chan was investigated and taken down by [[Interpol|Interlol]] and subsequently, k0w was [[raped]] by [[bubba]] in a French prison.<br/>
'''Status:''' Up.

== 2ch.ru ==

'''Status:''' <s>Downski</s> Upski

== [[7chan]] ==
[[Image:7chanDown.JPG|right|thumb|Nobody cares]]
After the death of its /i/ board, 7chan's userbase had shrunk a little and as such was unprepared for the wave of 4channers upon 4chan's downtime.<br/>
'''Status:''' <s>7chan is now officially back up, though no one cares still.</s> <s>WRONG! 7chan is down.</s> <s>hahaha disregard that I suck cocks</s> down indefinitely until their [[nobody|users]] [[unrealistic expectations|donate enough money to buy a new server]]

== [[Wikichan]] ==
[[Image:WikichanDown.png|right|thumb|Lol, fuck]]
WikiChan, that repository of [[Aids]] infested failure is also down.  Of course, it's been down for a while, but we have to sensationalize this shit, don't we?

'''Status:''' Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside Down
