[[Image:Twitter_pedobear.png|thumb| Rule1 fail.]]
[[Image:TwitterLololol.jpg|thumb|What happens when one of the largest websites on the internet FAILS TO SANITIZE USER INPUT]]

:''Not to be confused with [http://twatter.com/ this site].''

'''Twitter''', or as [[President Obama]] calls it, '''Twitter's''', is a [[BSOD|quality product]] invented by [[hipsters|down to earth people]] using [[Ruby on Rails|proven tools]] to deliver excellent service to their [[fags|customers]] in a [[Duke Nukem Forever|timely manner]].

''Translation'': Twitter was invented for brain-dead [[Hipster|modern]] [[n00b]]z to [[Unwarranted self-importance|talk about their pointless lives]] within 140 characters, so that their "friends'" attention spans don't implode under the pressure of having to pay attention to something for more than three seconds.

It was invented by Paulo Querido and is the Internets for black people and a [[Justin Bieber]] fansite. Whilst there are [[Nigga_Know_Technology|very few blacks on the actual Internets]] (since most [[ghetto]]s don't even have dialup or cash for computers) every nig in the world has a (prepaid) cell phone which are essential to [[419|Nigger Economics:101]]. Accordingly, '''twitter''' has become the only "web surfing" readily available to the black community and as a result, blacks represent the ethnic majority in this corner of the Interbutt. But don't take ED's word for it, follow every trending topic on a daily basis and it wall be at least 75% [[niggotry]]. 

Apart from that, '''twitter''' is a [[Web 2.0]] site for fags who are too stupid to use [[IRC]] and need turn-based [[chat]]. Typical Twitter users subject each other to a relentless [[SNCA|play-by-play of minutia in their otherwise meaningless lives]] 24/7/365. Got a new job? Just drank a glass of [[cum|milk]]? Took a big [[You|shit]]? '''Tweet''' it! 

Ordinarily, when one sees someone talking to themselves aloud in public one assumes that that person is [[batshit crazy]]. With '''Twitter''', however, you not only get to 'talk' to yourself 'out loud' without the presumption of insanity, you get to subject as many random punters as you can muster to your rambling thoughts and [[harbl|gibberish]]. With that in mind, we can conclude that Twatter is a paradise for people with [[autism]].

Entries are limited to [[derp|140 characters]] and are generally uploaded via [[Gay|txt]] and [[Gay|IM]]. Anyone you [[sex|add]] has their [[shit|entries]] posted on your feed and spamming up your cell phone, so there's no chance of avoiding them unless you block them. Twitter is considered by some as a "[[Stalker]]'s [[Heaven]]".

Twitter is notorious for its utterly shittastic [[Facebook|networking]] SKiLLZ.  Wanna say something to [[your mom|someone else]]?  Send them an "@ reply," which is the equivalent of yelling into someone's ear at a party with EVERYONE EVER around you, or if it's personal matters (you just can't keep your [[woman|PMS]] alerts from your [[boyfriend|boyfriend]]), whip up a DM (more like B.M., amirite?)  Or if you want to let people know that you're talking about the same topic that other people are, toss a # in front of it and WHAMO! Instant hashtag (Please note: hashtags are infinitely abused by [[black people]], likely rooted from some ancient tribal ceremony, or some shit like that. All too often will topics like #IAintKnoUBeTrippin or #WhereMyNiggasVarietyBucket appear in the trending topics)

[[tl;dr]]: [[LiveJournal]] on [[crack]] or [[Facebook]] without all the apps and just the status updates. The Twitter equivalent of the [[blogosphere]] is known as the [[Circle jerk|Twitterverse]]. 

Also, [[phishing|they ask for your email password when signing up]].

==Programs==
[[Image:twittershit.jpg|thumb|Typical look at recent entries page.]]
For being such a [[Truth|boring]], [[Web 2.0|useless]] website, Twitter has [[over 9,000]] apps to waste space on your harddrive. For some reason, these are really popular, as there's one entry for every five that says some stupid name that generally has the word "friend" or some variation of "Twitter" in the name.

* twhirl - Stupid looking waste of space.
* netvibes - Don't expect to know what this website even does.
* twitterific (more like Shiterific, [[amirite]])- Hmmm...[[stupid|post on the website for free, or buy a program to do the same shit for $15US?]]
* twitterfox - A [[Firefox]] plug-in. If Firefox is even open, it should take a few seconds to update with or without the plug-in.
* twit - Named after those who download it. Only for [[weeaboos]].
* twitterfeed - [[No|Semiuseful]] service for getting RSS feed items to a twitter account. 
* tinytwitter - Boring.

There are, obviously, [[truth|millions]] of other third party apps including blatant ripoffs of [http://playspymaster.com/ stuff like Mob Wars] from [[Facebook]].

==Notable People On Twitter==

<!--PLOX TO BE LEAVING THIS EMPTY!-->

==Entries==
Since Twitter is basically a [[Redundant|Retarded LiveJournal]], updates might range between one to two letters. Generally, an entry may be about what [[Shit noone cares about|music someone's listening to, when they're going somewhere, a response to someone else, what they just clicked on, what they just thought, what letter they just thought about, what punctuation they just thought about, or]] [[Emo|beautiful poetry]].

Even Twitter's own web site introduction admits that Twitter is redundant and offers no social benefit:

==No Troll Hypothesis==
In 2007, many fanbois and retarded bitches persistently claimed that [[Troll|trolling]] does not occur on Twitter. News of this Troll Free Zone - unheard of in the history of the [[Internets|internets]] - spread far and wide, and caused a massive explosion of ''late to the party'' lusers to sign up.

This theory has been officially trashed, as evidenced by the trolling of many famous persons including [[Billo the Clown|Bill O'Reily]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Trent Reznor]], and other douches in the late morning hours of 2009 [http://valleywag.gawker.com/5123624/twitter-hacking-epidemic-claims-britney-spears-barack-obama as reported by paid trolls Gawker.com]

Unfortunate [http://arielwaldman.com/ Ariel Waldman] unfortunately works for Twitter's unfortunate competitor Pownce:

{{quote|In June 2007, I unfortunately found myself on the receiving end of multiple accounts of harassment from a user on Twitter. When the user started using my full name in their harassing tweets, I reported the harassment as a form of cyberbullying to Twitter's community manager.|Ariel does the right thing.}}

{{quote|Unfortunately, in 2008 it escalated to a level that could no longer be ignored. Tweets were being fired off directly calling me a 'cunt' amongst other harassing language. On March 14, I wrote to Twitter, giving the example URLs of abuse and stated to them clearly...|Ariel can't take it anymore.}}

{{quote|It seems there is room in our Terms for folks to debate the difference between an update and an insult.|Twitter [http://blog.twitter.com/2008/05/our-terms.html doesn't give a fuck] about your lame drama.}}

{{quote|1=RT @chunkymunky lol twitter|2=DancingSandwich|3=[http://twitter.com/DancingSandwich sauce]}}

Instead of using the rather obvious '''block''' feature to ignore the [[Offensive|offsensive]] user, Ariel began to harass the Twitter admins with complaint messages, only to be ignored. Butthurt and embarrassed, Ariel embarked on a large scale publicity whoring campaign to let the world at large know that [http://arielwaldman.com/2008/05/22/twitter-refuses-to-uphold-terms-of-service/ Twitter refuses to uphold their terms of service'] including [http://getsatisfaction.com/twitter/topics/twitter_refuses_to_uphold_terms_of_service lawyers and all].

The whole event caused a great deal of worry and concern for Twitter's loyal followers, as it provided a simple and obvious proof to invalidate the '''No Troll Hypothesis''', and raepd them of any perceptions of their "specialness" as an "online community".

==Scalability Is [[Serious_business|Serious Fucking Business]] (My Cock is Bigger Than Yours)==
The instability of the Twitterverse and obsessive posting habits of many [[lusers]] means that daily use of Twitter has the network profile of a [[DDoS]], frequently choking the site and blocking updates. This forces the [[lusers]] back to their [[Blogosphere|usual faggotry]] where they whine and complain or post fawning sycophantic comments on the [http://blog.twitter.com/ fail blog], a colossal feedback loop of narcissism leading to a dripping clusterfuck of triviality.

===Transcript of a Typical Tweeting Episode===
* '''Tweet / LuSer:''' eating a bagel! om nom nom (10:41am)
* '''Blog / LuSer:''' twitter is down! waiting for it to come back (10:43am)
* '''Blog / LuSer:''' twitter is still down :( (10:51am)
* '''Tweet / LuSer:''' is this working? (10:58am)
* '''Tweet / LuSer:''' seems to be working (10:59am)
* '''Blog / LuSer:''' twitter is back again! (10:59am)
* '''Blog / LuSer:''' twitter is down (11:01am)

From the outside, this typical behavior could easily be construed as vapid inanity. But engineers know that Twitter is [[Serious_business|Serious Fucking Business]], making every Twitter failure a grand opportunity to compare penis size in blog posts that use the magic word '''Scalability'''. Technical experts know that Twitter is a '''Distributed Messaging Service''', which means that only engineers with massive cocks can understand the significance. Nothing could be more important than typical LuSer losing her ability to tell her retarded followers what she had for lunch. Of course, engineers know that they have bigger dicks than [[You|you]] ''and'' the Twitter developers, which is why they're obliged to mutually masturbate over every instance of Twitter fail, an activity which they call ''scalability advice from the trenches''. This continues to happen, despite the fact that none of them have ever managed a successful high traffic website, nor do they have any fucking idea what the Twitter architecture actually looks like. The tubes are alive with the sound of fap fap fapping.

===Technical expert reasons why Twitter architecture epitomizes [[Fail]]===
* It is built with [[Ruby on Rails]].
* The [[Series of tubes]] is not [[gay]] enough to handle distributed asynchronous push style messaging.
* [[TL;DR]]

===Actual reason why Twitter architecture epitomizes [[Fail]]===
* Twitter is a joke business that generates no money but plenty of lulz for its developers, who are attention whores addicted to the shit storm that occurs every time their service goes down. Twitter claims that it is not interested in [[Profit|PROFIT???]] ([[lulz|lulz wtf?]]) and only wants to expand its user base, everyone knows that the real reason is because their users are all black person so they'll never be able to make any money off of them. They're just trying to see how long they can trick [[Bernie_Madoff|Investors]] that they have a [[Bullshit|plan]].<br><br>The current plan goes something like this:<br>1)Get a bunch of black person to join.<br>2)[[????|????]]<br>3)[[Profit|Profit]]!!!11[[oneoneone|oneoneone]].

== Search.Twitter.com ==
As a sister site, [http://search.twitter.com/ Search Twitter] is a real-time search engine with which you can see what is being said about certain keywords at any moment. It's a decent tool for seeing what the sheeple are thinking. Go ahead, try out "4chan", or "I am gay". [[no|This might be the only redeemable aspect of Twitter.]]

Of course, the best time to use Search.Twitter is when there is a [[9/11|mass panic]] about. For instance, the [[swine flu]] scare showed just how [[stupid]] people became in times of [[bullshit|crisis]]. 

==[[Iran|2009 Iranian Riots]]==
[[Image:twitter.jpg|thumb|Twitter users finally getting their priorities in order.]]
Twatter has finally filled a niche, albeit a dirty, smelly one. [[terrorist|Iranian Citizens]] have recently begun [[anarchy|rioting]] in the streets because their poster-boy candidate wasn't elected. Being the [[Taliban|cunning, organized]] people they are, the people are now using Twatter as a way to communicate quickly and efficiently. [http://search.twitter.com/search?q=iran As seen here], live 'tweets' from the [[revolution|Revolutionaries]] are being made. 

What does this mean for Twatter? It means that [[Web 2.0]] has unknowingly shat out a perfect tool for [[anarchy|anarchist]] communication. [[LOL]]!

==[[Faggotry|The Fry Fiasco]]==
Sometime during [[2009]], [[Last Thursday|between October and November]], [[Britfag|Stephen Fry]] was happily typing away on his Twitter page, talking about what [[Al Gore|cereal]] he had for breakfast and when he was to film new TV shows, when all of a sudden a fellow Twitfag by the name of [[Troll|BrumPlum]] went on his page and [[Coolface|suggested that Mr. Fry maybe abit boring]].

Now instead of just ignoring him, Stephen fell for the troll bait and left a butthurt comment on the troll's page. This was nothing compared to what his [[Fucktard|fans]] did. They immediatly treated the troll like some sort of [[Rape|rapist]], bombarding Brum's page with hate comments and even [[Batshit Insane|threatened to kill him]]. Seeing what had happened, Fry paniced and threatened to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|quit the internet]] because he thought that [[Irony|Twitter had become]] a way of [[Spax3|spreading drama]].

His fans, not wanting to see their [[Homosexual|great]] [[Jesus|messiah]] leave their social networking site, [[BAWWWW|cried]] for [[atleast 100]] days until Stephen came back, admitting that he hadn't [[Left 4 Dead|grabbed his pills]] that day when he said he would leave.

==Ebert v. Breitbart==

[[Last Thursday]], Roger Ebert was shooting some B-Ball outside the school when Andrew Breitbart, who was up to no good, started making trouble in his neighborhood. They got in one little fight and Salon got scared, and said "you're moving in with your Aunty and Uncle in Boulder."

Breitbart, a right-wing controversialist in part responsible for the [[Obamacorn]] scandal, baited liberal movie critic Ebert with a comment about [[shit no one cares about|some movie]]. The exchange goes as follows:

{{quote|@ebertchicago Did you like Werner Herzog's 'Grizzly Man'? Best, perhaps, inadvertent exploration of progressive/leftist mind. Seriously.|andrewbreitbart}}

{{quote|@andrewbreitbart Huh? Treadwell was universally deplored as unhinged, and condemned for leading his girlfriend to death.|ebertchicago}}

{{quote|@ebertchicago film wasnt political but treadwells challenging absurd beardogma was embraced by mediaschools & framed as idealism & progress.|andrewbreitbart}}

{{quote|@andrewbrietbart Show me a "media school" that embraced Tim ("Grizzly Man") Treadwell, "& framed [him] as idealism & progress."|ebertchicago}}

This little slapfight, reported on by Salon.com, only scratches the surface of an ongoing back and forth between the two pundits. You can find the full article [http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/film_salon/2010/04/07/twitter_feud here].

==Twitter and Communism==

==Controlling Twitter Trends==

It's time to learn about control systems, especially in relation to controlling Twitter trends.

[[Image:Controlsystems c1.JPG]]

In our case:
#'''Process''' = Twitter web site
#'''Controller''' = Script that we have programmed
#'''Sensor''' = A way to obtain statistics about Twitter trends
#'''R(s)''' = Desired output response / ''Desired position of trends on twitter''
#'''Y(s)''' = Output / ''Actual position of trends on twitter''
#'''Td(s)''' = Noise in the signal / Twitter posts of rest of the world (non-anon)
#'''N(s)''' = Noise of measurement / We cannot access all statistics directly, instead we have to rely on third party which can add delay and incorrect data.

Why is this important? We can model this process as '''second order system'''. And let's say we have a controller that will position output at value of '''1''', this is how it looks like over time.
 >> step( feedback(tf([1], [5 1 .02]),1) )
[[Image:Controlsystems_c2.JPG]]

So, this is good, it will oscillate for some time and then it might stabilize (Assuming there is no noise.)
How? Let's say our program reads value of current trends and decides that is should push more one specific term. Now, it may happen that is pushes too hard and overshoots, that means it should now bring it down, and after that maybe push it back up again...

Unfortunately, what may happen is following:

 >> step( feedback(tf([1], [8 -1 .02]),1) )
[[Image:Controlsystems c3.JPG]]

In this case output does not stabilize, because controller is not programmed properly.

Another problem is existence of noise. Let's call
#'''Signal''' all posts from our script and
#'''Noise''' are posts from the other people.
Engineers define something called '''[http://anonym.to/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio Signal-to-Noise Ratio]'''. If this SNR is not large enough we will not have enough precision to stabilize all those trends.

===Conclusion===
What I have presented here are problems with dynamics of the controlling twitter trends. I don't have a proof that these problems will actually happen. But it is possible.
# We can have delay about the twitter statistics
# We can easily overshoot desired position
# We can have other people twittering randomly our terms and screwing up the output

In order to solve this we need
# Real-time detailed statistics (not just list of current trends)
# Good programming
# Lot's of participants to increase '''SNR'''

{{rainbowsmall|JEWS DID 9/21}}

[[Last Thursday]], some enterprising individuals found out you can embed CSS code in tweets and basically fuck up entire walls and pages.

Actually scratch that, turns out you could also run Javascript commands triggered onmouseover. What crazy scripts can you write in 140 characters? Why:

*Trigger annoying alert windows
*Crank up the font size to 999px and wreck the entire home page
*Create a giant overlay that masks the entire site
*Create a self-replicating tweet that retweets itself simply by people looking at it
*Get the prime minister's wife to post about [[pornography]]
*Get the US Press Secretary to post [[terrorism|DEATH TO AMERICA]]
*Combine all of the above and basically make the entire site unusable as [[borg|self-replicating tweets consume everybody's profiles]]

The event lasted for several hours on the morning of 9/21, until the hole was finally patched. Plans for a mosque are currently underway.
