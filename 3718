Hipster Hitler
[[Image:Hipsterhitler.jpg|200px|right]]

If you can't get the jokes in [[Questionable Content]],  '''Hipster Hitler''' may be right for you! 

Since you obviously haven't heard of it, it is ''clearly'' [[Cocksucking_rampage|the best web comic you've never heard of]].  I don't know if I can still like it if you do, though.

You wouldn't really fathom its [[shit nobody cares about|historically well informed situations]] or appreciate its use of [[mspaint]].  Besides, you only started hating Jews after [[emo|skinny jeans]] made it cool again.

But fine, go look at it if you want.  It's not like I can unpost it from /[[b]]/, [[reddit]], and [[fark]] and make it cool again.  Just know that I hate you so much more than I did before.
