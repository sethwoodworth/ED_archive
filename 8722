Utah
[[Image:Delicate Arch.jpg|thumb|250px|LOLS! CUM & VIZIT, we haz weird rocks.LOL!!1 (no [[fgt]]s plz)]]
'''Utah''' is the eternal home of [[Mormons]], Jello lovers, and those who still have a positive view of George W. Bush's presidency. It is most well known for its cultural homogeney, vast Natural Parks, a large stinky inland ocean, and lack of booze. It is located in the dead zone known as the Mountain Time zone, somewhere between [[Las Vegas]] and [[Colorado|Denver]]. Due to an unwillingness for residents to talk to [[Mexicans]], Utah's one bright spot is a reputation for having capital reefer.

==History==
[[Image:Brigham Young.jpg|thumb|Murderer, Usurper, Polygamist, and Utah's first Governor]]
In prehistoric times, the entire state was covered by what we now call "Bonneville Lake", which shrank to become the Great Salt Lake, an unusable waterway dead end that serves as a brine shrimp cemetery. This ancient lake turned most build-able land into swamp, which is unsuitable for building (but that never stops anyone). [[Native Americans|Indians (feather)]] lived here in relative peace until the Mormons showed up in 1847, led by a fat, usurperous, lustful man named Brigham Young. Upon setting up home base in the Salt Lake Valley, the Mormons claimed a huge swath of land covering most of the Mountain West, including a strip of land down through [[Las Vegas]] and annexing San Diego, hoping for a sea port. Both [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]] governments quickly told the Mormons to [[STFU]]. Early Mormons ran the "Nation of Deseret" as [[communists]], but managed to avoid any further run ins with the government until the 1890's, when the army showed up and let the Mormons know that marriage was [[Proposition 8|between ONE man and ONE woman]]. They also took grievance with the state for allowing the wholesale slaughter (in red face disguise!) of American Pioneers traveling through the state to [[California]]. In 1896, the Mormon church allowed the local government to prohibit polygamy, and was allowed to become a state as long as the federal government could appoint the first official governor. Since then the only things the State of Utah have accomplished are: The invention of [[Atari]], the birthplace of [[KFC]] (despite the 0% [[negro]] population), and the invention of [[Television]]. Obviously Modern Utahns are [[fat]] and slovenly. Good thing they also invented the artificial heart. 

==Major Cities==
===Ogden===
Ogden is the kind of place that is almost cool, but ends up failing because the population is a bunch of [[rednecks]]. Ogden is basically Utah's San Bernadino. This is the city where you are most likely to be killed by a Mexican cartel or motorcycle gang, or arrested.
===Salt Lake City===
[[Image:Conformity Demotivator.jpg|thumb|What Mormons look like nekkid]]
State capital and only outpost of reality in this strange land. Within the City Limits, a visitor might come to the conclusion that Utah has gotten a bad rap. Then one will notice that all residents live in extremes. No normal people live there. [[Conservative|Rightwing]] Mormon [[fascist]]s mingle with [[Gay]] [[Vegan]] [[hipsters]] on fixed gears. Mexican thugs have shoot outs with [[wigga]] "crips". Oh and then there is the [[Sea nigger|Tongans]], [[fat|you can't miss them]], but watch out or they will trample you and eat your groceries. 
===Provo===
[[Image:Shes 12.jpg|thumb|left|The Southern Utah lifestyle]]
Provo is the epicenter of the Mormon way of life. If you are not Mormon, it is advised that you stay out of this city. Rated 'R' Movies are routinely banned from movie theaters, draconian [[alcohol]] and public conduct laws are mercilessly enforced, and there are no beer sales allowed on Sunday. If you survive these terrors, your reward will be the throng of [[whore|Mormon hotties]] you will encounter on the BYU campus, you can get them in the sack if you take them out for ice cream and propose marriage immediately afterwords. Don't feel bad about running away after you pop on her [[tits]], the little jolt of reality you've just provided will serve her well.
[[User:Vonnegut|Vonnegut]] lives around here and wishes he lived in Salt Lake instead.

===Cedar City===
Cedar City is where all the little Mormon idiots run away to go to college. It is full of rich fucks and [[chavs]] who've led sheltered lives up to this point. The weather is completely fucking [[bipolar]], but it's the perfect place to get a 2 year accounting degree and find a [[slut|modestly dressed young lady]] to marry at age 21 before moving back home. 

==Government==
[[Image:Chris Buttars.jpg|thumb|"Gays are the greatest threat to the country, ever" -Congressman Chris Buttars (R)Utah]]
The Utah State Government is run completely by Mormons, and anyone who honestly believes differently is [[retarded]]. Almost all Utah related [[drama]] comes from the Government, or the Mormons ability to effect outcomes in [[Proposition 8|other states]] as well. [[Racist]] public servants from the state like Senators Orrin Hatch and Bob Bennett, and Congressmen Chris Buttars and Jason Chaffetz, make national news at least once a year each for saying something completely fucktarded. 
The Utah State government has become adept at wasting federal road maintainance money and National Park subsidies. 
They also paid an ad agency over 1 million dollars to come up with the following slogan to increase tourism. ready?:

Did you buy your plane tickets yet?

==Tourism==
All tourists to Utah are REI shopping yuppies. They come for the skiing, the National Parks, and the lulzfest that is Sundance Film Festival where they can watch movies about dikes. Also, the state's [[homo]] quotient goes up considerably for the Shakespeare festival in Ceder City. Unfortunate [[Neckbeard|IT professionals]] and other convention bound suckers usually arrive in Salt Lake City only to find that the beer is watered down, mixed drinks are tricky to obtain, and the [[stripper]]s are wearing pasties and a g-string. The Utah Jazz, the only major league sports team is a [[I am disappoint|disappointing]] mess year after year, usually because the players hate living here so much they hope to be traded as soon as possible. All in all, tourists leave with memories of elitest locals and jumping through hoops to get weak coctails, and no [[Porn]] DVD's to show for their trouble.

==Awful shit to come out of Utah==
