MOST parents are [[fucking]] [[awesome]]. Just ask any [[Africa|orphan]] how much they'd like a couple. Parents give away a huge chunk of their [[life]], [[Insane|health]] and [[unlimited disposable income|disposable income]] for their [[Retard|children's]] sake, but most realize, and far too late, that it isn't going to make them happy and that you just can't hand a toddler back when you're the parent.

So please be understanding when [[your Mom]] drinks those special silver shaker drinks and gets all weepy before lunch. Try to bond more with Dad, he'd be happy to show you the [[porn]] collection he keeps in the shed that he never leaves on weekends. Oh, and [[Teenager|teenagers]]: you can stop all that fucking whining and get your hair cut. No one cares about your stupidass problems or social awkwardness. If your parents aren't beating you on a regular basis, you're doing better than you probably deserve.
