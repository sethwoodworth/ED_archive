Orangina
{{Spoiler|French are fucking unfunny weird peopple }}

The '''Furangina''' "Naturally juicy" advert was spewed like a rope of Godless pulpy horror from the tip of [[France|the Eiffel Tower]] onto an unsuspecting world around the end of 2007.  While [[furfag|anthropomorphic animals]] have been used in a fairly close-to-the-trotter manner to shill products before, none of them had quite got as far using fruit juice to imply [[Sick Fuck|forced lactation and giant Orangina bottles]] to simulate Doug Winger-style [[macrophile]] [[futa]] [[bukkake]].

It will probably go down in history as the [[shock image|shock campaign]] which affected normal people and [[Anonymous]] with equal [[full force|force.]] Those who were aware of the tropes to which it was paying homage were horrified that someone actually got this shit on television, while those who weren't were left either murmuring under the chair in a fetal ball or rushing to the mailbox to cancel their subscription to [[Jesus|The Bible]]. Even some furries themselves find this commercial at least awkward to watch, since most seem to be used to their ten-penis, fifty-vagina'd hermaphroditic [[buttsecks]] being cartoony as opposed to realistic.

Speaking of hermaphroditic buttsecks, only male peacocks have the faggy tail feathers, yet the ones in the video also had tits. Peacocks indeed.

==Quotes==

<center>{{morphquote|mqtest|background-color: lightgray;|font-weight: bold;
|Interspecies erotica: perhaps the last taboo left untouched by advertising. Sure the Caramel Bunny flirted, but you knew she never put out. But anything goes these days as the deranged Orangina Naturally Juicy advert confirms. This citric acid-fueled CGI romp of sex-crazed fauna dry-humping each other is eye-poppingly weird. Lady Zebras in bikinis straddle phallic Orangina bottles that spray their unholy payload over a go-go dancing rabbit. The imagery in a Cher video looks timid in comparison.|James Donaghy, ''[[The Guardian]]''

==A CHALLENGER APPEARS==
A company called "Cascade Beer" released a video that isn't nearly as sexual, but still pretty [[Sick fuck|fucking creepy]]. Especially at the end.
