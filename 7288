'''Schrödinger's Cat''' can be summed up in this tasteful piece of [[art]]work:

Enough said.

== Actually, [[moar]] can be said: ==

Schrodinger's cat is the [[invisible pink unicorn]] for nonfags. He is a subject of much debate as to weather he is alive or dead. According to Schrodinger, his cat is neither alive or dead. This is fucking bull[[shit]] ( [[citation needed]] ) because you don't need a degree in accounting to know that something can't be dead and alive at the same time. Schrodinger  is belived to have made the whole thing up to distract from the fact that he was a [[over 9000]] year old virgin.

==Schrodinger==
Schrodinger was a [[Nazi]] [[zombie]] that [[fucked]] [[your mom]]. He worked for our Führer, [[Hitler]], and helped try to make a [[nuke]]. Unfortunately, this led to much [[fail]]. Deciding to impress his führer, he preformed an experiment using a Jew [[cat]]. After performing the experiment and telling his good friend Adolf that the cat was not dead, but dead and alive, he was immediately [[pwned]] for telling the führer [[bullshit]].

==The [[Bullshit]] he said==
Schrödinger's Cat is a sort of [[meme]] amongst self-centered scientists who believe the world only exists when they open their eyes and that the sun disappears every night. You probably heard about it from [[You|your]] [[Teenager|High School]] [[boring|Physics Teacher]] who either mentioned it [[At Least 100|at least 100]] times or wore a t-shirt referencing it for [[gross|a week straight]]. Go to any Physics or Math department in any college and you will see some [[Nerd|brownnoser]] trying to look smart by wearing a smelly Schrödinger's Cat shirt, and watch in horror as passing students chuckle. This is because Schrödinger's Cat is exactly the kind of [[Old Meme|stale]], [[unfunny]] crap [[Nerd|scientists]] love to laugh at over and over, despite the fact that the "joke" should have been dead [[Star Wars|long, long ago]].

Schrödinger's Cat was the star of a "[[Animal cruelty|thought experiment]]" in which a cat is placed in a box with a radioactive material with a short half-life. What's [[Some Argue|supposedly]] funny about Schrödinger's Cat is the [[Time Paradox|paradox]] that, due to [[Shit nobody cares about|the freak laws of probability involved in nuclear decay]], the cat is [[Divide by zero|both alive and dead according to the laws of quantum physics]]. The fact that corny science majors have been [[retard|chortling]] over this for running up on 90 years suggests that [[Virgin|some things really never change.]]

== [[Bullshit|Interpretations]] ==

*[[Unwarranted Self Importance|Copenhagen Interpretation]]- The cat only becomes alive or dead once the box is opened.
*[[wat|Everett's Many-Worlds Interpretation & consistent histories]] - When you open the box, a parallel universe splits off.
*[[Clusterfuck|Ensemble Interpretation]] - The dead/alive state of the cat is only statistically true.
*[[An Hero|Objective Collapse Theories]] - The cat observes itself, thus causing its own death.

{{quote|I did it for the [[lulz]]|Schrödinger, ''on why he likes to mutilate helpless animals.''}} 

{{quote|Scrhodinger was a man who enjoyed the death of cats. He was also a [[Scientologist]]. Or was it scientist? Either way, the man was a [[Shit nobody cares about|fucking genius]]. He trapped a [[kitten]] inside a box with cyanide and a radioactive substance. At the end of the half-life of the substance, there was a 50/50 chance the cyanide would be released, and the cat would be dead. However, because Schrodinger had the [[Hepatitis]] D Syndrome, he could not observe teh cat trapped in the box. In his theory, the cat was both alive and dead at the same time (see [[quantum physics]]). With this, Schrodinger proceeded to proclaim, "I have just [[divide by zero|divided by zero]]!!!" Almost instantly, Kool-aid Man broke through the wall of his laboratory and said in his deep voice, "[[divide by zero|OH SHI--]]"|Anon, ''gracing us with his usual faggotry'' }}
