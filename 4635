'''Konami''' is a <s>[[video game]] company</s> media conglomerate from [[Japan]] that is responsible for the likes of parasitic dancing games, card games (courtesy of screwing Upper Deck [[in the ass]] out of Yu-Gi-Oh cards) and shitty stealth-based games with more emphasis on cutscenes than actual gameplay. The company has also been known to produce [[plastic crap|action figures]], [[Olympics]] training facilities in Japan and [[anime]], usually involving [[loli]].

==History==
In the [[1980s]], Konami had a reputation for producing [[fail|brilliant]] titles on the [[NES]] that many a [[basement dweller|gamer]] would play for hours on end. Around that time, Nintendo was the industry's [[moderator|mod]] and limited its third party companies to producing only a [[42|handful]] of titles every year for its NES, believing that it's the [[unwarranted self importance|authoritive power]] of the game industry. In response, Konami established a [[sock puppet|fake company]] known as Ultra Games that distributed more of its [[crap]] into the states, as well as a [[European]] equivalent called Palcom. 

==Nao==
As [[Last Thursday|the late 90's]] passed by, Konami's developers woke up and smelled the [[goatse|coffee]]. They figured that if they start making games with painfully [[tl;dr|drawn out]] and [[bullshit|nonsensical]] storylines, they could make millions and release more of them. Additionally, they thought of producing [[boring|lackluster]] music games which would soon spawn to [[at least 100|numerous]] sequels, titles and spin-offs, providing more [[J-Pop]] crap to satisfy the [[weeaboo]] crowd. But since other game companies out there are giving more [[drama]] to their fans, Konami is an entity that [[nobody gives a shit|not many people would care]] about.

==The Konami Code==
In almost every single one of its games, Konami puts in a special [[cheat]] code that gives [[fail|lesser]] players extra lives or power-ups. While using the code in the NES version of Contra gives you thirty lives, they've managed to pull a dick move on players who'd enter the same code in the Super NES port of Gradius III, which [[WTF|destroys your ship]] instead of giving you full power-ups.

==FACT==
The only reason for the survival of Konami is [[Metal Gear Solid]].
