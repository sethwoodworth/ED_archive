'''Carleton S. "Carly" Fiorina''' is yet another [[W|Texas]] [[Republican]] running as U.S. Senator for [[California]] against Barbara Boxer.  Carly [[unwarranted self-importance|brags]] that she was the first [[woman]] to [[fail|successfully]] run a Fortune 20 company despite [[Irony|nearly destroying it]]. [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34086.html]

Currently, Carly seems to be running for either best Pee Wee Herman impersonator or Worst CEO/Politican ever. Every photo of her appears to be her in a [[Hillary Clinton|pantsuit]].

Her husband [[Frank]] is a former executive for [[AT&T]].

==The CEO from Hell==
Fiorina , the [[Lesbian|short-haired]] [[Satan|CEO from hell]], [[clusterfuck|merged together]] Compaq and Hewlett-Packard in [[Y2K|2000]]. The new Hewlett-Packard saw [[OVER 9000|18,000]] layoffs. Carly justifies [[bullshit|her actions were necessary]] to create 24,000 jobs...[[China|outside the United States]].
{{quote|There is no job that is America's God-given right anymore. We have to compete for jobs as a nation. Our competitiveness as a nation is not inevitable. It will not just happen.|Carly Fiorina, January 7, 2004.}}

In 2005, HP [[GTFO|fired]] her for being a total bitch, and for letting go of 3000 more workers to buy two Gulf Stream Private Jets.[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/05/im_carly_fly/] [[Some argue|Some say]] the creators of [[Google]] bought those jets shortly after she returned them.  However, Carly didn't walk away with nothing.  As part of her termination, she gave herself a $21,000,000 golden parachute, of which part of her severance package was spent on her campaign.

== McCain's Campaign Economic Manager ==
As [[John McCain|John McCain's]] campaign economic manager, Fiorina, being the [[hipster|hip trendy]] person that she is, encouraged John McCain to pick [[Sarah Palin]] over Tim Pawlenty as vice president. Her influence and poor decision making paved the way [[Barack Obama]] to move into the White House.

== Faux News sauce ==
Fiorina, like Palin, has been a constant contributor at [[Faux News]] especially Faux News Sunday.

==Campaign Commercials==

Calling out her opponents Tom Campbell and Barbara Boxer, Fiornia hired some stoner who watched way too many Terry Gilliam movies to make the following commercials.

The whole purpose of these commercials is to create or use [[forced meme|forced memes]] that are [[unfunny]].
