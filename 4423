[[Wikipedia:wiki/User:Jossi|'''Jossi''']] aka '''Jossi Fresco''' is not your usual, everyday [[Wikipedo]] admin: day and night, he's also the webmaster and publicist for [[Prem Rawat]], [[cult]] leader and '''[[Xenu|Lord of the Universe.]]''' Since Jossi became an [[Bureaucratic Fuck|administrator]] on the [[Wikipedia]], controlling their pages about Prem Rawat became just part of his job. 
Jossi doesn't only try to control Prem Rawat pages on the english Wikipedia: he's also signed up for Wikisource, Wikiquote, and a few of the Wikipedias in other languages to make sure they only have nice things to say about his Master. He even signed up to Metawiki to make himself look [[Serious business| really serious]]. As the Wikipedia's Captain Cult, he extends the blessings of his admin powers and experience in gaming the system to other cultists looking for total cult [[POV|PoV]].

==Birth of a Monster: From Sign-up to Admin==
[[Image:Dashboard for prem rawat.png|thumb|Wiki dashboard for Prem Rawat: OM<s>G</s>Lord of the Universe, Jossi is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Own pwner!] Momento, Zappaz and Rumiton are cultists; 64.81.88.140 was Jossi so it's a runaway WIN!]]
In April of 2004, Jossi signed up and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maharaji_-_Prem_Pal_Rawat&oldid=3207575 got straight to work with this page about his Perfect Master.] A month later, Mike Finch (anti-Rawat guy who [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/06/the_cult_of_wikipedia/page2.html also appeared in ''The Register'''s article]) created [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prem_Rawat&oldid=3637971 the original version of the Prem Rawat page.] Rawat cultists saw it, banged their heads together, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prem_Rawat&diff=next&oldid=3644079 started an edit war within 24 hours.] 

===Early Adventures===
Tricksy and sneaksy Jossi created the "Criticism of Prem Rawat" article, with the snarky content "Opposing views can be added here", but turned it into a series of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat&oldid=5669566#Elan_Vital.27s_characterization_of_the_ex-premie_group_members outrageous smears of critics] and 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat&oldid=5669566#Sources_of_criticism lame rebuttals of contributions from critics and neutral parties.] 
Almost all of the very cheap shots and low attacks on this page are from Jossi, either logged in as Jossifresco or as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:64.81.88.140 the IP address 64.81.88.140.] Zappaz, a fellow Prem Rawat [[cult|devotee]], was the only consistent cultist helper at the time.

Jossi makes one of his most entertaining plays when he forgets he's not logged in or using the "Jossi" computer in the office and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APrem_Rawat&diff=4430457&oldid=4430289 replies to a critic through an IP address.] He then logs in or uses his "Jossi" computer and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Prem_Rawat&diff=next&oldid=4430457 continues the reply (ripping apart the paragraph he's replying to in his rage).] The reply features this very twisted argument:

{{Q2|Jim. I would really apreciate it if you address me as a humqan being and not as a "cult member". You have absolutely no right to call me any names or to judge me. Who do you think you are? I am jewish and if some one peyoratively calls me "jew" I would not let it pass. I have also dark skin. If walking down a street in England someone would call me "paki", I would not let it pass. I will fight that with all my being. I will indeed. |Jossi|3 = [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Prem_Rawat&diff=next&oldid=4430457 here]}}

Let's try to unscramble Jossi's argument: calling him a [[cult]] member is a hate crime (although most people would say he is a cult member), especially because he is a "Jew" (but nobody other than Jossi said so and nobody would normally assume a connection, "peyoratively" or not), and even more so because he is dark-skinned (nobody said that), so if you call him a cultist you must be calling him a "jew" or a "[[paki]]", even if you didn't, and if you call him a cult member you are calling him a "jew" or a "paki" so you must hate him (even if you would not naturally have wanted to notice him in the street, let alone call him names, applicable or not) because, you see, he has dark skin, is Jewish, and is a cult member. [[What|Can you run that by me again?]]

These were very early days for Jossi, so "I am jewish" was probably a kind of mating call to [[The Wikipedia Jews|future allies on the Wikipedia]] whom he hadn't yet contacted by e-mail.

The beautiful thing is that he solidly confirms his identity as 64.81.88.140 on the Wikipedia at that time, when 64.81.88.140 was the main or second cultist contributor to all of these articles.

===Jossi for Administrator: What were They Thinking?===
It's always been cult-like, but Wikipedia characteristics like the siege mentality were still embryonic at this stage. Maybe that's why [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Jossifresco Jossi easily became an administrator (scroll down for some good opposing comments) in October of 2005,] especially with [[Essjay]] as his main supporter. Others must have seen his strong track record of making [[edit war]]s, personal attacks, [[lawyer|wikilawyering]], being disruptive, [[sock-puppet]]ry, running a single-purpose account, [[POV|PoV]] editing, using his account as a soapbox, and editing with a conflict of interest, so maybe it was just because he had identified himself on-wiki as a member by birth of the ruling [[cabal]] and probably done the same behind the scenes as well.

64.81.88.140 suddenly stopped editing a couple of weeks after Jossi became [[Bureaucratic Fuck|an administrator]] when someone asked this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A64.81.88.140&diff=28385317&oldid=16764521 awkward question.]

==Jossi the Model==
After Jossi became an administrator it was that much easier for him to keep the ten articles on [[Prem Rawat]], Prem's aliases, different names for his cult, two books, and a movie completely one-eyed. In the process, he created the model for other cultists looking to pull the same trick.

[[Image:Now let ME tell you.jpg|thumb|Jossi wants you to READ SOME GODAWFUL PROSE!]]
===The model===
#Sign up for the Wikipedia.
#Kiss [[cabal]] ass by popping up to play the parrot on policy and administrative pages (Jossi was fond of Martin Luther).
#Be passive-agressive like a real cabal member.
#Invite fellow-cultists along and make sock-puppet accounts: some will be aggressively biased so that [[you]] can play the voice of moderation and reason, others will play non-cultists who think the cult is cool (even though they claim to have never heard of it before) and that the non-believers are all biased.
#Accuse all non-believers of having a conflict  of interest on account of being in anti-cult groups ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&diff=next&oldid=4361481 hate groups according to Jossi]).
#Fill discussion pages with repetitive [[tl;dr|verbal spaghetti]] to try and make everyone else give up.
#Control the page.
This subject area has to have some kind of record for near-irrelevance and [[spam]]; the Prem Rawat discussion page on the Wikipedia has [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&from=Prem+R&namespace=1 over 35 archives (roughly one every six weeks) and twenty other sub-pages.] The nine or ten related articles have their own sub-pages and multiple archives. Sub-pages pop in and out of existence at Jossi's whim. Jossi and his helpers use this mess to obstruct others and get their own way.

==Conflict of Interest==
[[Image:Jossi-cultcap.png|thumb|left|Not conflicted. No. Not at all.]]
[[Image:Maharaji_Forum_of_cultures.jpg|thumb|His Lord of The Universe]]
'''"If Jossi is editing as a cult propagandist, he has a huge conflict of interest. Why don't [[they]] do something about it?"''' Well, the [[lies|"encyclopedia anyone can edit"]] has a place for that. [[You]] should be able to report Jossi's style of foul play on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard '''Conflict of Interest Noticeboard'''.] '''"So why does he still [[pwn]] all those stupid articles?"'''

The policy about vanity pages was supposed to cover conflicts of interest until [[Wikipedo]]s started sprouting the conflict of interest policy in September 2006. Jossi had been [[Piss|wetting his pants]] for fear of losing his [[penis|administrator status]] every time he saw someone get [[banhammer|banned]] for having a conflict of interest much lighter than his own. Since he was fond of playing the [[Bureaucratic Fuck|big man]] on policy pages by this stage, he jumped into the new page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AConflict_of_interest&diff=83459540&oldid=83060639 with this series of about twenty edits] and then [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AConflict_of_interest&diff=83652895&oldid=83459540 continued in tag-team mode for twenty or so more] with his ally [[SlimVirgin]]. Slim used her technique of shifting things about a lot to make matching the changes with earlier versions and simple reversion impossible.

The main thing Jossi wanted to get rid of was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AConflict_of_interest&diff=83054029&oldid=82733500 a specific reference to gurus and disciples].

The discussions are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Conflict_of_interest/Archive3#Discipleship here] and (less [[tl;dr]]) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jossi/Archives/2006_November#WP:COI here]. Jossi promised [[Internet Court|Arbcom]] member Charles Matthews that he would stop editing the Conflict of Interest policy, which meant [[shit]] by then, since he had what he wanted and [[Slim Virgin|Slim]]'s manipulation had pretty much locked it in. 

<br>
{{Q2|You have again removed the word 'discipleship', and again without prior discussion. You are very clearly a conflicted editor in so doing ...|[[Internet Court|Arbitrator]] Charles Matthews to Jossi|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Conflict_of_interest/Archive3#Discipleship Old Conflict of Interest talk page]}}

{{Q2|The main practical effect of your following up a disputed edit with two dozen more, is to make it harder to revert ...|Arbitrator Charles Matthews to Jossi|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jossi/Archives/2006_November#WP:COI Archived Jossi talk page]}}

{{Q2|I think your position is quite serious. You have an apparent conflict of interest here, and are lawyering about it, in my view.|Arbitrator Charles Matthews to Jossi|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jossi/Archives/2006_November#WP:COI Archived Jossi talk page]}}

Flush with [[cock|ego]] at putting one over on an Arbcom member by acting as if he and [[SlimVirgin]] were "the community", Jossi finally had the gall and hypocrisy to scuttle in and brazenly [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&dir=prev&limit=10&action=history create the Conflict of Interest Noticeboard]. '''"OIC."'''

===Criticism of Prem Rawat===
Cade Metz was misinformed about the "Criticism of Prem Rawat" article. Technically, Jossi did not have it  deleted; he might (or might not) have requested it by mail. He argued against the article but voted to keep it since it suited him as long as he was using it as "Criticism of Critics and Other Non-believers". This couldn't last forever, so he tricked a neutral editor into [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat&oldid=101882501 redirecting it] after its content was in the main article, then deleted the content from the main article. 
Jossi has deleted "Criticism" sub-pages of the discussion page and "Criticism" sections in the "Prem Rawat" article after using them to gather material he doesn't like.

===Jossi's "Fightin' round the Wikiworld": Wikisource===
Jossi happily uploaded megabytes of [[spam]] from [[Prem Rawat|his Lord and Perfect Master]] to Wikisource. When another user posted a few stubs about court cases involving the cult and its cultists, Jossi [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Proposed_deletions/Archives/2007-06#Court_cases hit the roof]  and started [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Administrator%27s_noticeboard/Archives/2007#Question wikilawyering like crazy.]
To make it look like he wasn't acting as an agent for the cult, Jossi offered even more spam from the Perfect Master through user Tprf. He was a little worried about checkuser, since Tprf was a meat puppet if not a [[sock]] (probably in the same office if it wasn't Jossi himself, [[ROFL]]), so he used the "unsigned" template to reply on the talk page for non-existent user TPRF (see the gallery).

===Pwnt===
In January of 2008, Jossi was approached by Internet superhero '''Mr. Cade Metz''' of ''[http://theregister.co.uk The Register]''. Metz had been talking to some disillusioned former cultists and was planning to expose Jossi. Jossi [[BAWWW|wet his pants]] with panic at the new threat to his beloved [[banhammer]], posted [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28assistance%29/Archive_5&diff=prev&oldid=190772601#Request_for_support_and_advice this hasty notice about what a great guy he is so everyone should support him], and went on his longest wikibreak ever. After giving his side of the situation and getting support on back channels (nobody posted an open response to his plea until after the article came out), he came back from the wikibreak to brazen the thing out. 

[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/06/the_cult_of_wikipedia/print.html Wikipedia Ruled by 'Lord of the Universe'] totally [[pwnt]] Jossi and led to frenzied activity on the Wikipedia.

Metz kept the spotlight on Jossi [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/06/a_model_wikipedian/ in this article] about a month of great [[denial]] and [[drama]] from the Wikipedia.

===Citizendium===
People on [[Citizendium]] [http://mail.citizendium.org/pipermail/cz-religion/2007-September/000000.html started asking awkward questions] about Jossi and his Prem Rawat article there in late 2007. [[Larry Sanger]] [http://mail.citizendium.org/pipermail/cz-religion/2008-February/000004.html chimed in] after The Register's article appeared, and then barred Jossi from editing certain articles in late February 2008. [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/User:Jossi_Fresco Jossi promptly quit] in a cloud of [[butthurt]]. Wikipediots are too [[cult]]ish to draw the obvious conclusions from his leaving just because he was forbidden to edit his favorite articles.

===Jimbo weighs in===
[[Image:Jimbo in kimono.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jimbo Wales]] sees nothing wrong with Jossi's [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/06/the_cult_of_wikipedia/print.html conflict of interest].]]
Apparently, [[Jimbo Wales]] sees nothing wrong with Jossi promoting his "[[Xenu|Lord of the Universe]]", [[Prem Rawat]], everywhere he can on [[TOW]]:

{{Q2|I went through a pretty good volume of the potentially COI edits posted in that discussion, and I found nothing which would raise for me any alarm at all.|[[Jimbo Wales]]|3= [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pax_Arcane&diff=prev&oldid=190019977 here]}}

{{Q2|I haven't seen any evidence '''at all''' of bad faith edits here. I am indeed taking a hard look at it. I came to this issue for the first time today, prepared to block Jossi as a hardcore POV pusher, etc. But then... I looked at his contributions. I looked at links submitted by critics. And what I found is... a great Wikipedian. So far, I have seen absolutely nothing to cause any concern... but I remain open.|[[Jimbo Wales]]|3= [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&diff=prev&oldid=190110417 here]}}

Jimbo attacks the messenger.
{{Q2|It's really time that people realize that The Register is not a serious website, it's a parody... of itself.|[[Jimbo Wales]]|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales/Archive_33#Wikipedia_is_run_by_a_Hindu_cult._Apparently. here]}}

===Wikipedia courts===
The Prem Rawat article became an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Prem_Rawat/Evidence epic case] at the Arbcom, [[Internet court]] of the Wikipedia. Jossi brazenly took it there as a way to avoid becoming a case himself. After it had been open for a month, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration%2FPrem_Rawat%2FProposed_decision&diff=206033245&oldid=205691618 the Arbcom received some secret evidence by mail]. This evidence must have been damning to Jossi because the Arbcom spent another month agonizing over whether to lie about it or not. [[Jimbo]] or the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] finally ordered them to close the case and make their conclusions a whitewash for Jossi.

====Why the whitewash?====
[http://www.prem-rawat-talk.org/cgi-bin/anyboard.cgi/forum?cmd=get&cG=3303138363&zu=3330313738&v=2&gV=0&p= Some speculate] that only a [[money|foundation-to-foundation]] connection can explain the blindness to Jossi's cult affiliation.

====Drama in Arbcom time====
This hero [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive398#User:Mukadderat_1RR_probation_violation fell into Jossi's control drama and played a very cool role.] Mukadderat was straight enough to correct one of the articles Jossi [[own]]s during the Prem Rawat article's Arbcom case, so Jossi hit the roof (again).

IsabellaW appeared out of nowhere to make the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Prem_Rawat/Evidence#Evidence_presented_by_Isabella_W. most deranged contribution]. She says [[bullshit|she is a researcher]] and like Jossi smears ex-premies (ex-cultists) by saying they form a [[hate]] group. Unlike the present Jossi she doesn't have to keep up any false pretences, so she says [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat&oldid=5669566#Elan_Vital.27s_characterization_of_the_ex-premie_group_members most of the same things Jossi said in the old "Criticism of Prem Rawat" article], claiming that the ex-cultists make cultist cows give sour milk, cultist chickens stop laying, cultist women have deformed babies, the full moon go dark on cloudless nights, and the cock of the Lord of the Universe go limp.

====Arbcom cabal praise OMGWTFBBQ WHITEWASH!====
{{Q2|Jossi disclosed his potential conflict of interest on 1 September 2004 voluntarily, and has been aware of the need to behave in a circumspect manner on pages relating to Prem Rawat. On 10 February 2008, he declared his intention to edit only talk pages for Prem Rawat related articles, a self-imposed restriction to which he has held. The Committee commends Jossi's voluntary restraint, and notes that it is not strictly required by the policy on conflicts of interests.|[[TOW]] [[Internet Court|Arbitration Committee]] final decision, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Prem_Rawat Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Prem Rawat]}}
So it's back to business as usual, with Jossi [[Wikipedia:Talk:Prem_Rawat| using the talk page to rule the article]] about his [[Prem Rawat|Perfect Master]] (except for Jossi turning [[Will Beback]] into an e-[[Hate|enemy]] along the way).

=="Technologist" and "high-impact executive"???==
[[Image:Jossif.png|thumb|Jossi took the blue pill]]
Despite being a hyperactive 24/7 Wikipedian,  the marketing partnership [http://www.cyberland.com/Our%20Team.htm Cyberland] describes Jossi as a '''technologist''' and '''high-impact executive''' with "extensive experience" in resume padding, claiming that Jossi gathered this experience "during extensive periods in Israel, Europe, the UK, South America and the US": must have been before he joined the Wikipedia, because he certainly wouldn't have had time since then.
Jossi’s partners at Cyberland include LeRoy West. Cyberland says that LeRoy "is a recognized expert ... new technology ... corporate message ... increase sales ... unique insight ... creative, technical, and business issues ... effective ... business success". 
LeRoy is very happy to associate himself with the [http://www.prem-rawat-bio.org/deca.html DECA Project] stating that he was once [http://www.worldassociates.com/company/lw.html Operations Manager for DECA, an aviation company in Miami,FL.] DECA was a sweat shop for Guru Maharaji’s dupes. Their biggest project was customizing (including a [http://www.bornrich.org/entry/high-tech-gold-plated-toilet-demands-250000-euros/ gold toilet]) a Boeing 707 for the Master.
 
Cyberland [http://www.cyberland.com/Services.htm lists lots of big-name customers] but not Prem Rawat. The company probably only exists to own the domain name these days, since [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_March_12/ai_19207424 this 1997 article] about an unsuccessful dot-com venture is the only evidence on the Internet that it ever existed, other than the hard-to-believe claims on the site. Jossi gets a [http://web.archive.org/web/19991117033256/maharaji.org/credits/webconversion.htm credit on this 1999 Maharaj Ji site] and is said to have been webmaster for The Prem Rawat Foundation from its 2002 launch. Boring people who read [http://www.guidestar.org/ tax returns] say the Foundation spent $500,000 on its website alone. 

This $500,000 of charity was surely well spent because Jossi knows business trainer [http://www.igeos.net/the_founders.html Tim Gallwey] who has the idea that managers get good by playing pocket pool and [http://www.tennismindgame.com/inner-game-tennis.html Inner Tennis]. Jossi [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timothy_Gallwey&diff=21475328&oldid=21184252 expanded Tim’s Wikipedia entry], which was only right as Gallwey is another Rawat dupe, and so is his partner Alvaro Pascotto who just happens to be the brother of the husband of the [http://www.linkcloset.com/detail/link-9708.html  Chairperson of The Prem Rawat Foundation.]

==Jossi Fails Remedial English==
Jossi claims "an advanced level of english" on his user page. [[ROFL]], his natural english is atrocious. He uses '''a lot''' of [[wikipedese]], which helps to hide it, but [[Some argue|some argue]] that he usually has a junior cultist around to fix his stuff up before he hits the save button.

===Jossi-isms===
Jossi-isms are easy to find. Here are a random few for teh [[lulz]]:
<br><br>

She took them to court. Jossi was named as a respondent because of his Internets role for Prem Rawat. His public role as webmaster (which he disavows on the Wikipedia) doesn't mean he mightn't also have been one of the [[Anonymous|John Doe]]s.

=== Public Relations and Wikipedia Administrator at same time = wtf?===
;PR for PR
[[Image:Drek .png|thumb|To try to confuse things, Jossi made this account with an e-mail address that sounds like the name of a site he hates.]]
These PR sites all list Jossi. Some are free but some cost money to join and most carry articles that really were written by Jossi for his Perfect Master. Jossi [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJohn_Brauns&diff=194944922&oldid=194936983 claims they are all a gigantic conspiracy against him] and made one with an e-mail address that sounds like the name of an site he doesn't like to support this. Joining these sites fits the same pattern that finds him pumping cult [[tl;dr]] into the public domain on Wikisource.
