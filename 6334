'''Dear rotten.com,'''

I am unsure if you are aware of the problems that your
"Incident with the bird" picture has caused on the
popular technology website [[slashdot]].  Many users of this site's
messageboards are posting links to
http://smoke.rotten.com/bird and making text based
representations of a bird on a man's [[penis]].  Frankly,
while I am pro-freedom, this type of photo sickens me.
Could you please move the location of the bird page
on your site to keep slashdot readers from seeing
things that are completeley unrelated to computers and
technology?  I'm not asking you to remove the content,
just to relocate it.

FYI the text representation of the bird is:

with a link to the offensive site
(http://smoke.rotten.com/bird) underneath, these
"[[Penis]] Birds" are posted by [[Penis]] Bird Guy, [[Penis]] Bird
MAN and several other users

'''Regards,'''

'''Andrew J. [[Tosh]]'''
