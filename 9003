[[Image:Me_by_whitedog1.jpg|thumb|Her [[Unrealistic Expectations|accurate]] [[fursona]].]]

'''Whitedog1''' is a [[finland|Finnish]] [[Beastiality|dogfucking]] [[furfag]]ette who makes [[shit|awesome]] comics about [[Twilight]], [[Death Note]], and of course, furries. When she isn't busy masturbating, hiking snowy mountains and [[Marry Your Pet|marrying her pets]], she makes [[the best]] comics ever to grace [[deviantART]]. The sole purpose of her comics is to act out her sexual fantasies that usually involve Twilight characters in questionable poses and sexual situations, and not to mention some [[yaoi]] too. Her [[unfunny|shitty]] comics are constantly seen on the front page of DA, most likely due to her retarded fanbase, always licking up the shit that whitedog [[Unbirthing|squats down and shits out]].

==The Comics==

[[Image:UmWhat.jpg|thumb|WhiteDog does something else on a daily basis besides her comics.]]
[[Image:NoThisIsntFunny.jpg|thumb|How is this funny, again?]]
The very thing that got her famous was the rat hole known as [[DeviantART]]. WhiteDog has learned the secret to earn pageviews, all you have to do is submit comics at a daily basis. The comics are famous for featuring furfaggotry, [[Twilight]], and [[Gay|other unknown shit]]. Of course since WhiteDog is both a furry and a sexually starved Twilight fangirl, the only "jokes" she could come up with are about sex, gay sex and yiff. On top of all that, all of her comics are incredibly [[unfunny]]. These comics make newspaper comics look as if they were filled with comedy gold. Her furry comics are basically about yiff and nothing else, since furries ONLY think  about yiff. It also sheds some light on how sexually [[fat|starved]] she is. Since she can't get a boyfriend in real life, she often draws gey sex and masturbates with her special [http://www.buzzfeed.com/akdobbins/twilight-dildo Twilight dildo].

Her comics are also completely [[CTRL ALT Delete|dull]], [[Justflyakite|bland]] and [[Megatokyo|poorly drawn]]. '''All''' of her comics are just sketches. The only color of the [[Homosexuality|rainbow]] that was lucky enough to be in her comic is the color [[menstruation|red]]. And it's only used as blushing and hearts. Instead of using the text tool, she writes the words in her own hand writing, which makes it harder for the [[tartlet]] to read. Besides the fact that her comics are poorly drawn, uncolored, and uses nothing digital to make her shit more bearable, [[animu|all of the characters look the same. All of the male humans in her comics has the same features such as their rectangular jaw and the ideal buff body. Whilst, all female humans have a pointed chin, wide-opened eyes and a thin body with a huge bust. The only things she changes are the clothes and hair]]. Her sense in anatomy is pure shit, also. In her bizarre world, she thinks that she knows everything about male anatomy, and that not all books have [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/126815668/1102289580 correct anatomical understandings]. This coming from a girl who has [[lesbian|never had a single cock interested in her]].

Since Whitedog is the master of [[Shitty art|comics]], [[Art school|anatomy]], [[Uncyclopedia|comedy]], and DeviantART, [[Suicide|what else could she possibly do?]] Well it seems that she also knows how to make likable characters, too. That's right! She's a total expert on how to make [[Mary Sue|characters]] that you can [[Fap|relate]] to! She also made tips on her [[LiveJournal|ElGay]] that would help her fantards make their shitty comics [[fail|better]]. Her list to make a likable female character is to make her have conflicting character traits such as being an interesting character- but not too much, hot- but not too much, and to be shy around her love interest-but not too much (I think we're seeing a pattern here). For the males, they must be very hot and very interesting. It seems that Whitedawg HAETS [[Mary Sues]] but loves Gery Stues only because it's the gender she hungers for. Using her guide, the results are that all of the female characters are alike and same goes with the male characters, since she thinks that there is no need to make more varying personality traits.

==Her fanbase==
[[Image:Laphuman_by_whitedog1.jpgâ€Ž|thumb|left|We learned how to be generic shits from Whitedog1!]]
[[Image:Tribute To whitedog1 by MidnightMysteryMeow.jpg|thumb|left|Their humble offering to the queen.]]
Stupid. Horribly stupid. They're identical to the Twilight fanbase, which is pretty obvious since the fanbase also consists of Twilight fan girls. Like how Stephenie Meyer made her fangirls sexually starved by constantly describing [[Fag|Edward Cullen]] as an OMGSUPERHOT, sparkling douchebag, Whitedog1 did the same by making her audience drool over furry buttsecks. Whenever Whitedog posts anything new, they will go [[homosexual|straight]] to it and comment as if there were no tomorrow which makes it appear on the front page. Her fanbase is filled with untalented pricks with no telling of what is or isn't funny. They're the type of people who loves laughing their asses off while watching the Disney channel and reading other [[unfunny]] [[furry]] comics. Because of their poor art skills, they see Whitedog as [[Lies|the greatest and most funniest artist on DeviantART]], since, logically, if you draw a male torso reference, you must be a great artist, [[wrong|right]]?

They often make shitty [[MS paint]] comics "imitating" Whitedog's humor hoping that they can be just as famous as her. Their comics are even more unfunny and poorly drawn than that of Whitedog's. Often, they make "responses" or continuations to her comics by adding even more shitty dialogue and less effort. Her fangirls are also known to lurk her userpage waiting for more comments to come and replying to them by saying "liek i no shes so funnai!11" and posting emoticons. Because of them, her page is covered with the same comments from different people. However, they also lurk her page just waiting for a hate comment and will reply with massive tard rage, claiming that Whitedog is [[Lies|totally hilarious]], and that the flamer is wrong in every way.

They also search for journals and stamps that doesn't share their undying love for WhiteBitch. They will constantly whine and say "just ignore her". Of course the very irony of that statement is that they have chosen to do the exact opposite of their advice and will do anything in their power to attempt to remove said deviation or journal. They will do whatever they can do to defend their precious Queen of DeviantART, and will even report the person or the stamp and claim that they're harassing her since they just can't handle the fact that there are other people who just don't share the same opinion.

After Whitedog's absence, her fanbase did exactly what was expected. They gathered at her page and cried about their "great loss" acting as if they [[Facepalm|need to read her comics in order to live]]. Instead of Whitedog's userpage being filled with ass-kissing comments, now it is filled with crying fags trying to find their precious Whitedawg. Since Whitedog left no reason for her absence, her fans started coming up with theories instead of contacting her and asking why. Their biggest theory is that she was butthurt after the creation of this article. Shortly after, they convinced themselves that the theory was true. 

However, these are the type of people who would get easily offended by reading the first sentence and add bullshit claims that they read the entire article and claim that [[Lies|there is no truth in the article.]] Because ED insulted their great goddess, they actually believe they have god given right to [[Internet Tough Guy|kill the contributors of this article]]. They're also planning to track them down and [[Unrealistic Expectations|make them pay for what they have done.]] Of course, they look like complete idiots, since they ignore the fact that they can simply press the history tab above. What makes them fail even more is that they can't see that there is mainly one contributor of this article, and they can't even tell their gender. In this case, ED is more or less used as their scapegoat and they utilize it to blind themselves from the fact that Whitedog gets more irritated by her fan base than anything that opposes her. If anything, her fan base is more likely to be the reason for her disappearance above all theories, making all of the shitstorm on her page completely ironic.

==[[Premenstrual_Tension|I BLOCK YOU]]==

[[Image:FURRYBLOCKU.PNG|thumb|An accurate depiction of WhiteDog1 in action.]]
[[Image:Whitedog1_blocked_stamp_by_shamoosh.gif|thumb|Yaaaaaaaaay!]]

{{squote|I block people whose comments annoy me. This way, my annoyance level stays low and my productivity level high. A few individuals suffer, but the majority of my watchers remain happy.|Whitedog's reason for her block rampage.}}

It all started when WhiteBitch got tired of her many fans. You know, the very [[Loser|people]] who got her popular in the first place? Since she is a popular user on [[DeviantART|ShittyART]] and submits even shittier comics on a daily basis, she gets flooded with comments from her legions of [[Goatse|goats]]. Some comments are at least decent and tolerable while others are incredibly pointless such as saying "first comment" or just "lol". Because of all these comments she began to set up "rules" for other users. It seems that she still wants comments on her art yet expects them to be up to her standards. That's right, she just can't risk turning off comments because she still wants to read YOUR ass-kissing comments.

The reasons why she blocks people are rather inane, even for WhiteDog. For a girl who keeps uploading to please her watchers, she wants their comment to be typed in the way she wants it to be. And that's what you should expect from your fans when you're popular, [[No|right]]? One reason that would get you blocked is commenting too much while another reason is [[Bullshit|not commenting enough]]. In that case, why not list a rule that tells you how much comments you should make? She also hates it whenever there is a comment that compares or favors a certain character. Does her faggy goat remind you of some animu character? Well, if you mention that, you will guarantee to have your name placed on her block list. Like everything else she does in life, she utterly fails at coming up with a good reason why that would get you blocked.

The reason for blocking by critiquing is utter bull shit, too. Her so-called reason for having critique undesired is that [[Lies|she wants to improve on her own]] instead of just explaining the actual truth that she is either too lazy to improve or that her ego is so large that she would throw a fit at anybody who disagrees. She will also pull more shit out of her ass that if she works more on her comics, the less she'll upload and the less she pleases her watchers. But everyone knows that she doesn't two shits about her watchers one bit but only their ass kissing comments.

Furthermore, she considers seeing her message box filled with new comments to be abhorrent. However, that shouldn't even be a reason to trim down her messages because she doesn't have a DA friend like your typical user. It's not like she's waiting for a reply from a certain user, since she doesn't need something from a specific deviant. Following in the footsteps of [[Justflyakite]], she will also block you for drawing fan art. Again, she will never state why that will get you kicked off her page, but further proves that she adores [[Hitler]] with a [[Yiff|passion]]. If you happen to be someone she dislikes, you will also have a spot on her list of blocked people. Further proving that her popularity has turned her into even more of a bitch if that was even possible.

[[NO U|DO NOT DO THE FOLLOWING. OR IT SHALL GET YOU B&.]]

*[[Waaaambulance|Posting critiques]]
*Replying to other comments
*Saying things like "I love your work!"
*Not commenting enough
*Commenting too much
*Saying things unrelated to the image
*Saying her characters remind you of someone else (be it pre-existing character, another character of hers, or your friend)
*Saying one of her non-OC characters is being OOC
*Saying "first!" or "first comment!"
*[[Grammar Nazi|Using improper grammar/spelling]]
*[[Bitch|She doesn't like you]]
*Asking technical questions or things that aren't even answered in her FAQ
*Asking what she's making references to in her comics (like 'tossed salad')
*Stating you prefer one character over another
*Saying things in another language (even if it's her native one),
*Drawing [[Fan Art]]
*Saying something about sports
*Using plz accounts

Exacto: Wut this isn't funny. D:<BR>
WD: WHAT HOW DARE YOU QUESTION MAH NEWFOUND POPULARITIIIEEEZZZ. *block*|medli20
|I just find it a little ironic that our dear WhiteDog1 is complaining about knowing when to speak in another language when days before she fudged up her German, sending many of her poo-brained fans into a Google frenzy.|lolwhitedog1
|[...]I understand I have no right to say, "that's not art!" I know you will tell me to ignore her art if I don't like it. However, consider that she can hide "hurtful" comments; why doesn't she just ignore them and leave them out for others to still see? Grow a pair, Dog, and learn to take some criticism! It is not horrible. It will help you to become a better artist.|lolwhitedog1
|I don't understand how other deviants can tolerate the crap she gives them. They love her comics enough to support her, despite the fact that she's a total, egotistical brat who step all over the people who gave her her popularity in the first place? She could easily disable comments if she's so picky about them.|PianoxLullaby
|If she doesn't appreciate her fans, I don't think she deserves them. And in the long wrong, this is all her fault. She's the one stepping on her admirer's, acting like a stuck up brat, and being completely immature.|Pianoxlullaby
|I commented on it 90 minutes after it was uploaded saying something along the lines of "how has this already gotten 180 favorites? It's nothing."|Exactoman
|Sometimes a character will be fat and sometimes a character will be skinny, but other than that, the only way I can tell them apart is by outfits and hair.|MissStarSeed
|I really wish some people would just toughen up and actually take the bloody time to review on what they ACTUALLY need to improve on. But nonetheless, the rabid fangirls will still continue to support this whitedog1 person.|dumbots345
|Aww all the fans are becoming butthurt because a nasty article got written about their leader.

I personally find the ED article hilarious.|NoughtsandCrosses15
|seriously, now. You were just a slave to your uncalled for and out-of-place mass polularity. Your mindless, brain-fucked watchers fed into your "comic genius" time and time again, and yet you treated them all like crap. And STILL they comment here, crying over your absence. My god it's pathetic! Maybe if you actually ever CARED about a single one of them, I wouldn't be calling you out on all of this.|opalfine
