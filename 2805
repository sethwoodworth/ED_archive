FacePunch cards
Upia, a member of FacePunch got this "brilliant and original" idea 
of making [http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/showthread.php?t=234253 facepunch trading cards.] 
If he got it from [[4chan]] or not is unknown to us all. He says himself he got it from the [http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/showthread.php?t=231811 Fp item collab thread]
The trading cards is related to everything between heaven and earth, 
but most is based on FP, its members and famous [[internets|internet]] shit
In total there is 153 of them at 21:31 GMT+2 19/11/06

Note that [[at least 100]] of them are centered around [[Shoop da Whoop]]. That's because facepunch users are [[dumb]] and [[unfunny]] [[cunt]]s.

== Revival of Facepunch: TCG ==
On the 18th of May 2008, fellow facepuncher [http://forums.facepunchstudios.com/showthread.php?t=538183 SCopE500] thought it would be pretty lulzy to recreate the card making with a new start, by completely revamping it into a [[Shit|cool]] thing. Unlike the previous cards, these actualy had a new layout and actual rules (although they look an awful like [[Pokemon|Pokeman]] cards). Many [[Meme|Memes]] have been subject to be turned into cards (some lulzy, others complete shiet) as well as facepunch users making themselves as WMD ÃœBER-CASH-GODLIKE cards of mass destruction though [[Fail|failing]] at the same time.

To date UTC 04:52:35 07/30/08, there are 444 individual cards for this version (proves the existence of [[Basement dweller|obsesed card makers]])
