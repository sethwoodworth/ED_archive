'''João Bernardo Sousa''', known online as ''jbs17'', ''jbs'', and ''ahetal'', is a prolific [[CP|child pornography]] spammer from Portugal. He was paid $2,645 by [[Sharecash]] to spam their links on [[4chan]] over the course of several months, but got a little too greedy and tried to sell the secret to his dubious success in an [http://www.rapidspread.com/file.jsp?id=oyrdbtjufg e-book].  The e-book was sold online at [http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php?t=1554154 Digital Point forums] for $30-50 a copy until he was called out on his use of child porn, and was subsequently banned. His email address was found in the book, which led to the discovery of his real-life identity.

While other spammers like [[Kimmo Alm]] spammed 4chan with bots, João opted for the human [[rape|touch]], manually spamming 4chan for hours on end. Nevertheless, he never learned the subtle art of staying in the thread he had just posted, so he spent much of his time searching for his own threads on /b/, as shown in the [http://www.mediafire.com/file/jcyg3qmfhzm/spamming.rar video] he made for his e-book. Despite the handicap of cluelessness, João spammed persistently, and on November 6, 2009, his child pornography spam set a new [http://sharecash.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=6628 record] of $227 for the most money ever earned on Sharecash in a single day.

[[User:Sharecashsucks|JBS]] himself has tried to vandalize this article by replacing any mention of CP with software. What he does not understand is that [[:Encyclopedia Dramatica:Vandalism is Pointless|Vandalism is Pointless]].

Many Portuguese /b/tards have been denied access to /b/ because this faggot caused our ISPs to be b&. Should he be spotted [[IRL]], please [[rape|make him see the error of his ways]].
