The intro to my werejohncandy tf story.

{{frame|
I've got to admit it's kind of nice being a werejohncandy. I get all these cool superpowers like super strength and i'm also incredibly cute when in werejohncandy form.<br/>

Being a werejohncandy has so many different advantages to it. I have so many new friends now.<br/>

You know the health problems that humans get if they're overweight? Well it doesn't apply to werejohncandies or members of the werebelushi family. And now that i'm a werejohncandy myself, I don't have to worry about those health risks.<br/>

I also get to eat all the food I want and I can never get sick. Plus the immortality and invulnerability are really cool.<br/>

I'm a pretty intelligent werejohncandy as well, not to mention i'm pretty agile even when in werejohncandy form. I'm also a martial arts expert. The claws come in handy too.<br/>

Not to mention I have got a pretty powerful roar, but don't worry I won't hurt you. After all, us werejohncandies only attack if we get mad but that only happens if anyone makes a joke about our weight.<br/>

The only problem I have with being a werejohncandy is that the transformations are usually murder on the wardrobe, you see I have to bulk up quite a bit- growing 6'2 and gaining 300lbs of fat, fur, and cuteness and this causes my clothes to get tighter and tighter until they burst at the same time- fortunately like the Hulk my pants remain intact.<br/>




There's plenty of space and vaulted walls and ceilings so I don't have to worry about bumping my head or accidentally breaking anything when in werejohncandy form.}}
