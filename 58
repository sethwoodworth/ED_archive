2003
It seems a lot of things happened this year, but [[nobody gives a shit|nobody seems to remember]]. In the tender year of 2003 the Madonna/Britney lip-lock appealed to the fantasies of 14-year-olds and masturbating grandpas. Allegedly, It was said that Michael Jackson likes to get children drunk and play a game of "Rubba Rubba". There were plenty of other embarrassments in the year 2003 that didn't make the top 10, but did make the "middle 11". Like, Justin Timberlake sharing post-vomit kiss with Britney. After January's American Music Awards, Britney was spotted at the posh Joseph's Caf√© in Hollywood, retching her guts out in the toilet. According to the source, "she then left the bathroom, where Justin was waiting outside. They were holding hands and kissing." If that is not disgusting, then I don't know what is. 

Other incidents, included Hilary Duff breaking ties with Disney, Sharon Osbourne Kicking Cancer, Actor Richard Chamberlain admits he's gay (Who?), American Idol star almost killing a child with Jet ski, and the like.
