Randomcasualty
'''Randomcasualty''' ([[IRL]] known as Neil Braithwaite and "that guy who cries at night"), is a former lordly assface and drama llama infamous for faking his own death, proving that even the most powerful deviantART admins are gullible [[dumbfuck|dumbfucks]].
Before the scandal, he was one of the most insignificant shoutbox moderators. Then he "died" and nothing of value was lost.

==BLARGH IM DED==

Like the attention craving whore that he is, one day he decided that being part of the staff wasn't enough, so he decided to do what [[The Great Sonic-cide of 2007|any true TARTlet would have done]]: faked his own death. His "brother" (which was actually him under another username) claimed that Neil was another victim of [[the cancer that is killing /b/]].

devianTART users are known for being a bunch of gullible sheep and he used that advantage for his evil scheme. News spread like wildfire, many of his gay buddies[http://neom.deviantart.com/journal/9794113] [http://vonny-t-h-m.deviantart.com/journal/5782327/] [http://satanic-mistress.deviantart.com/journal/5646511/] were devastated. Everyone forgot about it two days later and tartlets resumed their usual activities: cutting themselves and [[yiff|yiffing]].

==Fake death on the internets is srs business==

Spyed, like the corrupt admin and butthurt bitch that he is decided to broadcast such [[shit nobody cares about|IMPORTANT]] news via the 'hot topic' system, successfully sending the message to every fucking TARTlet, along with a whiny bitch of a journal[http://spyed.deviantart.com/journal/9789845/].
Back then, calling out deviants was against the rules, so he basically gang raped them brutally.

Randomcasualty also posted a lulz filled journal asking for forgiveness[http://web.archive.org/web/20061129132818/http://randomcasualty.deviantart.com/]. As a result of this whole affair he was banned shortly thereafter and lost his useless seniorship status, friendships and staff merits. OH LAWD.
