Serial Experiments Lain
[[Image:Lain_hacker_small.jpg|thumb|right|How come that girl is out of the kitchen?]]

In 1998, when you were still using Windows 95, a television show came [[animu|out of Japan]] called "Serial Experiments Lain."  As far as animation quality goes, it was pretty much on par with anything else from that period - no fancy 3D CG or expensive [[good korea|Korean]] inbetweeners.  However, something about the show made it popular enough in America that it's been seen by a large portion of [[nerd|Internet users]] and the theme song is a cult hit, even becoming [[writing yourself into an article|certain dramacrats']] ringtone.  

==Why This Show Matters to [[You]]==

In the early days of home computing, before [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], [[4chan]], or [[wikipedia|Satan's lair]] had been invented, the internet was a fresh, new thing which wasn't even used by most people and couldn't be found in the nearest [[Starbucks]].  It held exciting possibilities and many [[Old media|technology columnists]] and [[Old people|academic types]] made [[Obama|great promises]] of a future ability for all people to connect and grow.  It was a rosy world which [[Bill Gates]] predicted in ''The Road Ahead'', a world of instant and customizable content being shipped from person to person everywhere.

In hindsight, the optimism of the early nineties was generally unwarranted.  In 2010, cable companies have yet to deliver decent and egalitarian internet service (which was a prediction in ''The Road Ahead''), and [[Facebook]] and [[iPhone|smartphones]] are the closest things to a global network dense with easy access to all of one's own personal information.  The grandiose projections were nothing but useless conjecture because they ignored the unpleasant underbelly of [[Usenet|newsgroups]], which would only be magnified by graphics and real-time communications into the downright degenerate realm of the modern internet.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the chans.  Before any were actually invented, folks would have said that nothing could be better for advancing knowledge than a group of anonymous users writing on a shared bulletin board.  Now we know that chans are only good for [[furry]] propaganda and the human waste called the "[[hivemind]]."

==But That Didn't Actually Help Me Understand==

"Serial Experiments Lain" weaves itself into the tapestry of the Web's development because Madman (the show's production house) didn't have the rose-colored glasses everyone else had.  That's right - Madman was pessimistic, so they were able to make a hit.  In the show, a young girl named "Lain" decides to get on the internet because a girl she walked home with once committed [[suicide]].  On the internet, she discovers all of the bad things that we're quite naive about today.  She sees folks addicted to computers in general and people addicted to small [[Isabella_Valentine|computerized mind-control devices]].  She runs up against [[FBI|mysterious gun-toting strangers]], a [[hivemind|bizarre monster]], and [[trolls|merry pranksters]].

Eventually, she realizes she's caught up in a huge mystery.  The clues that informed her were that her sister went totally freaking insane and her parents decided to just [[quit]].  She goes farther into the internet as she quests for an answer.  What she finds, with wires dangling out of her head and computers stacked up all over her room, is that she isn't even a human being.  Not a human, but a person "born on the internet," in the absurd wording of the show.  Though no concrete explanation is ever given, a focused viewer can elicit that she is a collective consciousness.  She's just all of the memories and ideas that folks have [[lj|written online]].  

==This is The Crazy Part, Kind of Like Every Episode of [[Code Geass]]==

Even though she's like 11, Lain gets busy doing deep thinking.  She starts to remember the girl who jumped off a high-rise in the first episode.  She comes to the conclusion that she's [[God]] and should delete herself from everyone's memories.  What this amounts to is an [[IRL]] [[flounce]].  Her "mind" is still alive online, but the body everyone had hallucinated about for over a decade just disappears.  

Madhouse, in 1998, was able to visualize the modern internet.  Lain is essentially a more benevolent version of the "hivemind" that comes out of places like 4chan.  She is the personification of modern internet subculture.

==Madhouse?  More like Arthouse, eh?  Eh?==

Serial Experiments Lain caught a lot of attention just for presenting a strange viewing experience.  Just listening to the show is hard on some viewers because the sound engineers decided to stick a [[Template:3500|60Hz hum]] in the background.  [[Dat_ass|Wearing sunglasses]] is probably a good idea because many of the daytime scenes are so very bright as to cause macular degeneration in susceptible viewers.  As the show progresses, strange visual elements are brought in to help out with storytelling through symbols.  This mostly amounts to bizarre patterns floating around in shadows - things like pools of blood and weird 2D CG vortexes.

==This is 4chan's Brain on Lain==

4chan is very proud to be what they are.  They more or less worship the "[[hivemind]]" that they've become, and because of that, it's an unwritten rule that Lain was queen of [[b/|/b/]] before [[Boxxy]] or anyone else showed up to claim the title.  Lurking on any 4chan board for an hour will result in seeing a couple of Lain jokes, at the very least.  

The Lain fanclub extends farther than 4chan, though.  Countless websites left over from the early days when [[Geocities]] was hot stuff are buried on the web.  They include such things as [[fanfiction|plagiarism]], primitive simulations of Lain's computer interface, and a drinking game.  The drinking game has been lovingly [[copypasta|reposted]] below.

<span class="co;[Last call was an hour ago];[Errybuddy in da Wired get tipsy];0;cop"></span>

<div class="cop">The rules are simple: Take a sip of your favorite beverage whenever any of the following actions occur in the series. Game begins at the point in each episode after the "People walking around in traffic/neon lights/buzzing wires" expositionary sequence has ended. Those who wish to play this game are not required to drink real alcohol, but those who choose to do so are encouraged to drink as strong a brew as they can get their hands on, in keeping with the spirit of the lain series, and with it's unofficial motto: "If you're going to get f*#@ed up, you might as well get f*#@ed up good!"

Of course, those of you who are REALLY brave and who have a notably high tolerance for alcohol may want to try playing our special edition [http://amethyst-angel.com/lain_drinking_game_extreme.html lain drinking game EXTREME VERSION]. But don't be too surprised if you find yourself lying unconscious on the floor thirty seconds into the first layer...
