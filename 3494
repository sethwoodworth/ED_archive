'''Grindr''' is a [[gay]]ass application that [[faggot]]s use to stalk each other with. Grindr is said to be full of cheese, in part of it's ability to bring new [[lulz]] to wild world of camwhoring. Its basic concept is to allow for access to other gay and bisexual men within close proximity to the user. A single tap on a picture will bring up stats and a brief profile. From here the user can choose to chat and share more information, such as exact location, send more pictures, and finally hookup for '''hot gay [[sex]]'''.

[[You]] get download grindr for free from the [[itunes]] store or local gay bar.

The name "Grindr" is an homage to the grinding of teeth common in crystal [[meth]] addicts, whom comprise approximately 93% of the Grindr userbase. Conversely, the other 7% of the userbase are so morbidly obese that iPhone users need to turn their phone sideways in order to display the picture's total width, and should therefore consider a [[meth]] addiction themselves.
