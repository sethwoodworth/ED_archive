YouLoveMolly
{{facepalm|This article is about inbred trolls|tell Molly ''India is in Asia''}}

Molly, along with Rachel and Saraa have become arguably the most prominent [[Youtube]] trolls of the past [[Last Thursday|eight months]]. They have generated more overall [[butthurt]] and [[Burn a Koran Day|intolerance]] than an entire [[KKK|Klan Rally]] full of [[ouch|hemorrhoid]] sufferers.
This article is about the rise and fall of Molly's [[epic]] troll group.

== Converting an indian to christianity - don't let the devil win  ==
YouLoveMolly's story is a sad, disgusting one. It all started way back in 2009 when [[Retard|Molly]] invited her two friends Rachel [[lesbian|(a regular one)]] and [[man|Saraa (an Indian prostitute)]] over to discuss why [[niggers|Indian people]] are [[scientologists|hellbound scumbags]] according to [[Fred Phelps|Gawd]].<BR>
Of course, the conversation went nowhere. Molly and Rachel sounded ended up sounding like stubborn, delusional cultists. Then they polluted the internuts with a painful 9 minute 36 second [[lulz|lulz-fest]] that humiliated Molly, her two [[prostitutes|friends]], and every other lifeform on the Prime Material Plane.

== Me Lip Synching to "The Climb" ==
The next video Molly uploaded to [[jewtube|Youtube]] was a terrible lip-sync of lousy pop singer [[slut|Hannah Montana's]] ballad "''The Climb''".

== Showing off some of the BEST JOKES EVER ==

After that, Molly and Rachel [[lesbian|(a regular one)]] described in vivid detail their shared [[butthurt]] over the comments posted on the last two videos. Then they tell unfunny and strange knock-knock jokes which only adds to the already large amount of (anti-)lulz.

== Going Green with God ==
In this video Molly, along with Rachel and Saraa attempted to go "green" by wearing green shirts, making necklaces out of soda cans (which they then proceed to empty out; which brings up the question: why not just drink the soda?), and plant [[cum|seeds]].

== Saraa goes to church ==
Somehow Molly finally managed to get Sarah to Blaspheme against Ganesha by bowing down to [[christianity|The God of Abraham]]. It most likely was not even Sunday because the place was completely abandoned (as any truly worthwhile church should be). So, for about seven minutes Molly basically just walks Rachel and Saraa around an [[scientology|empty worship center.]]

== Debating with A British Guy ==
In Molly's final official [[Youtube]] vid, she mass-"debates" over [[Skype]] with [[United Kingdom|Sum Smug Limey Fuck]] (who sounds suspiciously like SomeGreyBloke) who has all this Education and Shit. BG managed to [[pwn]] Molly without her even realizing it. She hallucinated that she "held her ground nicely" by numbly repeating tired talking points for ten minutes, clumsily avoiding the Limey's questions and not learning a damned thing.

== Reaction ==
[[File:Molly_evil.jpg|thumb|]]
While most people probably realized that Molly's videos were satire parodying the [[Christfag|religious ultra-right]], a few select [[retards]] with video cameras decided to publish their [[Fake|sincere]] reactions to YouLoveMolly's vids. These videos prove that Molly was indeed a [[successful troll is successful|successful troll]], and that [[at least 100%]] of Youtubers are too dumb to realize that.<BR>

== [[Moar]]!? ==
My [[Anon|sources]] tell me that two more YouLoveMolly videos were uploaded to [[Jewtube]]. However, they were deleted only weeks later. Luckily [[basement dweller|someone]] managed to snatch them up and re-upload the damn things. So here are the "lost" (and final) chapters of the YouLoveMolly videos.
