'''Adventure Time''' is a un-entertaining piece-of-shit cartoon created by [[Old people|Pendleton Ward]] that was made for [[Threatening suicide|Nickelodeon]] to air between whatever [[shit]] heaps they've been shoveling since [[gay|Ren & Stimpy]] was canceled [[at least 100]] years ago. That part isn't important, however. What '''is''' important is the massive [[lulz]] the cartoon induces when viewed with our good friend [[marijuana|THC]] and when you [[troll]] one of its [[fanboys]].
The show was recently picked up by [[Cartoon Network]] and is currently being ruined for all the [[pedophiles|lovers of the original pilot]].
The main premise of the show is a kid named Finn (who was named Pen in the pilot...but really who gives a shit) and his dog (named Jake) going on [[Shit nobody cares about|adventures]], which usually involves fighting monsters/people nobody cares about in the most agonizing, lolrandumb way possible. The series will make you want to drown [[cats]] because the transforming dildo never [[STFU]], plus the show seems to fuck up everything it can get its hands on, such as [[ninjas]] and [[slut|princesses]]. There are a crap ton of fanboys on Youtube who are just ,asking for it and are not hard to find. If you encounter one, the following should be done.
* spam the channel with hate
* claim the show is just "lolrandumb XD bullshit"
* claim the show is "pretentious hipster bullshit"
* combine the last two options

==Butthurt Fanboys==

Recently, a Youtube user decided to get some lulz out of trolling the fanboys by providing commentary to the episode "Evicted". Their response is a laughable attempt at ad hominem via fat jokes, which provide minor [[lulz]].
