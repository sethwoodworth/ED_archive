KindredSpirits
[[Image:FSS_Main.gif|thumb|Kindred spirits indeed!]]
'''KindredSpirits''' is the <strike>sex</strike> relationship wiki headed up by [[Quasidan]].  By simply glancing at some of the articles it contains, one can finally understand that [[rape]] and [[sick fuck]]ery are very important in a relationship.

Some of its more popular articles are [[shit|scat]], [[wtf|Moose Club]] and [[fake death|How To Fake Your Own Death]].

They also have a long-standing rivalry with the equally [[hawt|lusty]] BBS, The Loveline Companion.
