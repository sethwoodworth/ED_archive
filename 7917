'''Superman''' is a name of a comic book character and a sex move. This is interesting as comic book fans have no sex.  As always on [[ED]], when there is more than one subject to be discussed in a single article, we discuss the subject that the majority of our readers will concern themselves with first. Every [[faggot|actor]] who's played superman has been [[pwned]] in some way or another. Coincidence? [[Lulz|You be the judge.]]

The character was born as '''Kal-El''' on the planet [[Krypton]]. On Earth he was known as '''Clark Kent'''.

'''Superman''' is a character created by a couple of <s>[[Nazi]]s</s> Jews to glorify the [[White]] race. [[IRL]], Superman is [[PowerWord: IRL Name|Clark Kent]], a mild-mannered [[old media|newspaper]]man who looks exactly like Superman, except he wears glasses and a strap-on. In reality, he is Kal-El, the last survivor of some planet that blew up [[at least 100 years ago]]. Like many [[Alien|landed immigrants]], he crashed on US soil in a small metallic escape pod from space and [[Truth|forgot to apply for citizenship]], but they still let him vote. His brothers are Sonny and Michael Corleone and Tom Hagen, as his father was Vito Corleone.  [[Cool Story Bro|The name Superman comes from the German word "Ubermenschen" which was a Nazi term for the SUPERMEN, or the Aryan race]]. 

Also, Superman is [[gay]] and has [[Faggotry|homosexual]] relationships with his editor, a [[Shota|photographer boy]], his archenemy [[Cancer|Lex Luthor]], and [[Batman]]. Superman also has a line of softcore [[pr0n]] films that costar [[Aquaman]].

The most interesting period of Superman's comics was the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Nazis had been replaced with writers who were taking illegal [[drugs]] long before it was popular. The editor, who took the most drugs of any of them, was infamous Julius Schwartz. Under his guidance, DC Comics constantly cranked out comics that were always either awesome, [[stupid]], or awesomely stupid. Making fun of these comics has become popular recently on [[teh]] [[internets]], especially on [[Superdickery]].

A large number of the people Superman knows have the initials LL, which means that they are [[lesbians]]. Yes, lesbians. One example is Lois Lane, an [[attention whore]] who pretends to be Superman's girlfriend and wouldn't "love" him if he had no powers. In [[reality]], she is having sex with her rival Lana Lang. Lex Luthor qualifies as a lesbian even though he is a gay man because he secretly writes [[fanfic]]. [[Fanfic lesbians]] know that Luthor is one of them. Since ''Smallville'', lesbians have started have been obsessed with Luthor having [[buttsecks|sex]] with Superman [[in the ass]].

[[Gene Turnbow]], who plays [[Second Life]], believes he is Superman and has adopted the identity of Kal El. 

==Notes==
*Lesbian comic book readers have [[Divide By Zero|less sex than male comic book readers]].
*The aforementioned point is retarded, as negative numbers are not [[IRL|real]] numbers.
*Technically the aforementioned point is true as having negative amounts of sex results in other people around you having sex with anyone you try to approach.
*The aforementioned point is pointless.
*The aforementioned points are both valid as negative sexual numbers always leave '''ALL''' [[lesbians]] in a constant state of [[asking for it]]. Nature abhors a vacuum and like a black hole of [[cock]] this leaves them in a constant state of waiting to be [[raped]].
*Lesbian comic book readers spread their anti-male propaganda on Yahoo role playing chat rooms.
