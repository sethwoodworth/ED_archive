'''FatQuack''' ([[Powerword|real name]] '''Robert Dixon'''; born January 15th 1994, lives in Halifax, West Yorkshire) is a [[greedy]], [[scam]]ming [[Britfag]] who created a [[worthless]] program called '''[http://www.wiigamestudio.com Wii Game Studio]''', a [[PC]] utility for [[lazy]] [[fat fuck]]s who want to code homebrew for their [[Nintendo]] [[Wii]]s.

WGS sparked a bit of [[controversy]] and [[drama]] on both the [http://wiibrew.org WiiBrew] [http://forum.wiibrew.org forum] and [http://www.wiigamestudio.com/forum.php the forum of WGS itself], questioning the licence and legality rights of the program, but the true [[lulz]] came in when one of FatQuack's [[buttbuddies]], '''Dan3008''' (real name '''Daniel Radcliffe''', not to be confused with the actor for [[Harry Potter]] of the same name; lives in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire), thought that one particular WiiBrew forum admin who was against WGS, [http://arikadosblog.blogspot.com/ Arikado], a [[poor]], [[teenage]], [[Castlevania|Alucard]]-loving [[faggot]] who also codes Wii homebrew, [[Bullshit|was also one of the spammers of the WGS forums in disguise]], and proceeded to tell FatQuack this. And ''he actually believed him''.

==History==
{{Main|Super Smash Bros#Hacking}}
Once upon a time, a [[hacker]] named "bushing" decided to hack Nintendo's latest console (at the time), the Wii, by creating a malformed savegame for ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]: Twilight Princess'' which would exploit a programming flaw in the game and be able to load potential homebrew code. After this, he and a team of [[l33t]] hackers created such homebrew code for said malfromed savegame called the ''Homebrew Channel'', a program which could load other potential Wii homebrew from an SD card.

Eventually, Wii homebrew and hacking begun to develop, eventually leading from people making their own homebrew games and applications, to the point where people such as [[tourneyfag]]s could hack ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' to edit code, [[Texturefag|textures]] and [[music]] (leading to [[shit]] such as Brawl+), and finally, to the point where they could even mess with the [[operating system|OS]] of the Wii itself.

However, there's a bit of a problem for [[newfags]] who want to code homebrew for their Wiis. You see, programming original Wii homebrew requires you to have a decent knowledge of [[C]] or [[C++]] (which are both ''free to learn''). Most people who code Wii homebrew know this shit already, but some people who want to join in on the [[circlejerk]] either don't have the time or are extremely fucking lazy (probably the latter) to learn new coding language, and want a fast, reliable, drag-and-drop PC utility that can do all the dirty work for them.

This is where FatQuack's "program" Wii Game Studio comes in.

===The Program Itself===
[[Image:7zip_legality.PNG|thumb|340px|Mentioned [http://www.7-zip.org/faq.html#developer_faq time and time again].]]
[[Image:Im-in-your-GPL-2.gif|thumb|160px|left|An accurate representation of what Dixon is doing to the GPL]]
Based on [http://www.yoyogames.com/ Game Maker] by Mark Overmars / [[LOL WUT|YoYo Games]], Wii Game Studio sets out to do nothing more than rip people off by making them pay [[$]]9.99 for a "Pro" version that adds nothing new to the bare-bones utility. Hell, even with the "Pro" version, it still lacks substantial features like multiplayer and support for other controllers, making it not worth the buy.

Further more, proof that this program's a scam can also be found by the lack of licenses. Both WGS and the installer of it violate the [[GPL|GNU General Public License]], because the GPL-protected software it uses ([http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip] for the installer; [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/GRRLIB GRRLIB] for WGS) are not listed or even fucking credited ''anywhere'' on the site, the installer or the software itself. While it has been said that WGS uses the very first version of GRRLIB (the one that doesn't have a GNU GPL), [[some argue]] that since the licensing measures of GRRLIB changed, it might also apply even to the very first version of GRRLIB, making WGS (and FatQuack himself) still a victim to [[lawsuits]].

On top of that, Wii homebrew itself is not only free, but [[open source]] as well, while WGS is not. Ask yourself this: why the hell would someone create a Wii homebrew creator that costs you money for a "Pro" version, and without any source code made available, when most, if not all, of the Wii homebrew (including the compilers) available is downloadable with ease and free to edit for ''everyone else?''

==Drama==
===WiiBrew Forums===
[[Image:Wgs promotion.PNG|thumb|290px|right|An example of the WGS promotion.]]
Sometime in late [[2009]], Dan3008, and another member of the WGS forums named LordAshes, came crawling into the forums of WiiBrew and promoting WGS. While many were interested in the product, most (including Arikado) were against it, criticizing the fact that you need to pay money for the "Pro" version of WGS, when, as previously stated, you could learn C or C++ for free. It was later found out by other members of WiiBrew that WGS had a lack of licenses, which made people hate WGS all the more. A member of the WGS forums called "WiiFSX" tried informing FatQuack about this, which he responded to by completely removing his post.

Eventually, some people started to spam the WGS forums with all of the issues of WGS in mind, one of which was a person named "Cornell". Cornell was soon [[banned]] by FatQuack, and [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|all of Cornell's posts were removed]]. In addition to this, Cornell (or somebody else) also impersonated as [[PayPal]] in a fake email sent to FatQuack. Dan3008 was belived to have later told FatQuack that [[Bullshit|Arikado was, in fact, Cornell]], and FatQuack begun straight away creating a e-mail message to Arikado. However this was not the case. It is still unknown who told Fatquack that [[Bullshit|Arikado was, in fact, Cornell]]

===Arikado===
On January 12, [[2010]], FatQuack sent a e-mail to Arikado stating the following:

{{Squote|[[Jack Thompson|Will Thompson]]<br>(Arikado/Cornell)

I am FatQuack from Wii Game Studio and if you try any more [[Trolling|funny business]], I will press charges for fraud due to your fake email from paypal. After 01/02/2010 you may return to wii game studio (though I cannot see why you would want to) but further offence will cause a perminate ban a legal action against ths paypal fraud.

Robert Dixon - FatQuack}}

Arikado was [[Goatse|shocked]] and [[confused]] about this messege, becoming [[paranoid]] about going to [[jail]] and even thinking of going so far as to abandon his identity as "Arikado" forever. He eventually responded to FatQuack with a [[TL;DR]] message stating that he was innocent and didn't do anything under the alias "Cornell" and that he was underage and couldn't handle lawsuits, in addition to stating that he was not called Will Thompson irl.

FatQuack responded by saying that he was told that Arikado was Cornell from a user of WGS (not specifically stating directly that it was Dan), and that he assumed that Arikado's name was "Will Thompson" from [http://facebook.com/Arikado this], all while telling Arikado that [[Bullshit|WGS isn't illegal]] without even explaining why. Arikado responded with yet another TL;DR message:

{{Squote|[...]

The name "Arikado" was picked for myself because it is one of my favorite video-game characters in the Castlevania video-game series. Literally everywhere I go online the name is taken. I post under the name "OArikadoO" if the name "Arikado" is taken because the O's emphasize "Arikado" strongly. If I have something to say, I will not hide my identity under an alternative name. So, it is certainly not surprising that someone on [[facebook]] stole the name before I could :/

The connections between me and Cornell were probably made because whoever your friend is thought, "Hey look, two people who strongly dislike [[Scam|Wii Game Studio]], zomg!!! [[No|They must be the same person]]". Obviously this demonstrates the sleuthing tactics of a [[Child|two year old]] and I will thank you to in the future to find some form of proof beyond speculation to before accusing anyone of anything.

[...]

I certainly don't mind you questioning my activities or pointing out a possible connection, but to falsely accuse and threaten me upon a basis of speculation is simply inexcusable. You clearly must have some form of [[Autism|mental illness]] if you want to take down this "Cornell" you don't like so badly that you would go to such lengths as to do what you've done to me.

I'm afraid this whole incident has made me feel rather sour towards yourself, your friend who accused me, and even more so towards your product.

[[Advice|I will thank you never to email me again.]]

--Arikado}}

Of course, FatQuack, being the [[pretentious]], butthurt [[jackass]] he is, didn't take Arikado's advice, and went on to email him once again, trying to once more take him down with a chat log from a WiiBrew related [[IRC]] channel.

{{Squote|1=[...] I would like to call upon the offer:

"I certainly don't mind you questioning my activities or pointing out a possible connection"

Would you mind telling me what is meant by the post "I'll tear his post apart when I wake up tomorrow :p" (refering to my product) on this page:

http://testing.lukegb.com/logviewer/index.php?action=viewlog&channel=%23wiihelp&datetime=1260918000

[[Bullshit|I am not asking this in accusative way, but just to settle my mind]].

[...]

-Robert}}

[[Image:Letting_it_go.PNG|thumb|left|290px|Letting it go.]]
Arikado responded by telling FatQuack that [http://forum.wiibrew.org/read.php?20,44369,44446#msg-44446 the "post" he was referring to] was one created by LordAshes over his confusion over why people don't like WGS. The post in which Arikado "tore apart" LordAshes' post can be seen [http://forum.wiibrew.org/read.php?20,44369,44493#msg-44493 here].

Arikado posted his conversation with FatQuack [http://arikadosblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/my-experience-with-wiigamestudiocom-aka.html on his blog]. After this, FatQuack himself posted on WiiBrew, trying to tell everyone that [http://forum.wiibrew.org/read.php?20,44369,46714#msg-46714 he was sorry for the drama he caused to Arikado] and that [http://forum.wiibrew.org/read.php?20,44369,46735#msg-46735 he will acknowledge the licenses of the programs used for WGS]. Arikado, after all of this, decided to [http://forum.wiibrew.org/read.php?20,44369,46879#msg-46879 let go] of everything that happened between him and FatQuack, stating that he hopes that FatQuack legalizes his program for everyone in the Wii homebrew community to use.

=== Dan3008... ===
[[Image:Dan_irl.jpeg|thumb|left|Dan3008, irl. [[Smug|Note the smirk on his face]].]]
====...returns to WiiBrew====
On February 22, 2010, [http://forum.wiibrew.org/read.php?24,49789 Dan3008 returned], and instead of promoting WGS once again, asked for help on other ways to update his Wii, since [[Lol|he apparently just gets an error code trying to update]]. Arikado gave him direct instructions on how to update parts of the Wii OS, but Dan3008 didn't seem to listen. Arikado made a remark that she expected this kind of retarded behavior from Dan, and the topic quickly went offtopic when Arikado started to go out of his way to [http://forum.wiibrew.org/read.php?24,49789,49858#msg-49858 personally insult Dan3008 and FatQuack once again], with [http://forum.wiibrew.org/read.php?24,49789,49862#msg-49862 Dan3008 trying to defend himself], only to get [[pwned]] [http://forum.wiibrew.org/read.php?24,49789,49865#msg-49865 once more].

[[Image:Fatquack_dan3008-not-shoopd.jpg|thumb|Not shoopd.]]
====...vandalizes the FatQuack article====
On June 25, 2010, Dan3008 somehow managed to quickly find this article, and begun [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=FatQuack&diff=1998477957&oldid=1998477862 his little vandal spree], being oblivious to the fact that [[vandalism is pointless]]. Please note the delicious spelling, as shown below:
{{squote|"cornell" tried to discreddit the program, in the same fassion as "Mikelle" as as such was given a permenant ban|Dan3008, [[Dyslexia|refassioning spella]]}}
Most people, who weren't aware of who Dan3008 actually was, speculated that it was FatQuack himself. [[User:Snaisybelle|Snaisybelle]] found out that Dan3008's [[IP address]] was from Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, and assuming that Dan3008 was FatQuack, [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=FatQuack&diff=prev&oldid=1998478009 added the information onto the FatQuack article]. It was later found out that Dan3008 was in fact, as previously stated, a buttbuddy of FatQuack, and the edit was later reverted.

==Aftermath==
As said before, FatQuack continues to sell Wii Game Studio illegally, despite the advice that was consistently given to him. LordAshes eventually created a "Wii Game Studio" of his own, [http://wiiconstructionset.hopto.org/ Wii Construction Set], which he, unlike FatQuack, is giving away for free. However, [http://www.wiigamestudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=2533#p2533 he still seems to remain loyal] to FatQuack and his buttbuddies, helping out on a brand new scam called "[[Sega|Game Gear]]s", which seems, according to [http://www.wiigamestudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=2645#p2645 this post], to be able to develop homebrew for multiple consoles.

When it's eventually released, we can expect a lot more flaming and trolling.

==FatQuack's Family and Friends==
* '''Harold Dixon''' - FatQuack's [[father]].
* '''Amy Dixon''' - FatQuack's twin [[sister]], who is [[morbidly obese]].
* '''[http://invisionsoft.co.uk/ James Garner]''' - Another buttbuddy of FatQuack's. [http://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/showpost.php?p=2148133692&postcount=8 He's the one who now maintains] FatQuack's previous scam, [http://www.dsgamemaker.com/ DS Game Maker], which, believe it or not, is an even bigger scam than WGS, as [[Redundant|you need to pay for DSGM again]] after every 5th update.

Come on guys, Be real, This is just a mindless artical written by a couple of people because they are jelous that '''I''' came up with the idea for WGS before thay did. Yep, I'm fatquack, and a few others. Good look catching me :D
