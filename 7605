[[Image:She_is_her_everything_-_yoshishell.jpg|thumb|Snapesnogger fan art!]]

'''Snapesnogger''', a.k.a. Snogger, Snoggerific, [[Irony|ravingartist]], RavingG, Owljam, [[Sockpuppet|lil-owl-gem, Gyrem, Ves, jerrymalou, and Lee Osprey]] ([[Powerword|real name]] '''Gemma Wilson'''), is a [[diva|whiny little brat]] weeaboo from [[deviantART]] who alternates between drawing lame-ass [[anime]]-style ''[[Harry Potter]]'' [[fanart]] (mainly of Alan Rickman's Severus Snape in thongs and various gay apparel) and some hideous breed of hermaphroditic half-snake monstrosities. She also has a huge [[circlejerk]] of mindless [[weeaboo]] [[fan]]brats whose insidious lovefests have caused her to skyrocket to the second most popular deviant on the goddamn site.

She believes it's perfectly fine to draw the same way for several years with little improvement or variety, and if you challenge this notion, she will instantly lash out at you, claiming that you are clearly blind as to not recognize the brilliance of her [[shit no one cares about|mpreg, 60% female/40% male nagas with non-female vaginas and non-male cocks.]] She will then proceed to curl into a little ball and weep like [[your mom|a bitch]].

Dmitrys, known dickgirl artist, has been quoted with the following, "And eah i meet Snapesnogger live, beast is frightening."

=About Snapesnogger=


[[Image:A scary photo of myself.jpg|thumb|left|The infamous whiny, self-centered little cunt in all her clearly hideous glory. TEH HORRAR!]]
Snapesnogger has written and drawn illustrations for several [[fucktarded]] stories which include:

* Her [[fanfiction]] in which Snape and Hermione get turned into [[:Image:Bunny-snape.jpg|the cutest iggly noseless bunnies you ever did see]].  They '[[asl|fall in love]]', [[whore|have lots of sex]], Hermione gets [[pregnant]], et cetera. Warning! Never look at this shit.
*Her comic "Angel 1,000", about some retard angel with a cheese fetish and his friends fighting demons. Not much is known about this story save that the main character is a [[nerd]] who dies and becomes the special 1,000th [[kawaii|bishie]] angel, and that all of his friends can be found in their original forms in Japan's finer anime. It serves as a fine testament to Snapesnogger's [[bullshit|unabashed creativity and originality]].
*Her comic [[FUBAR|"Red Venom"]], which stars a [[homosexual]] 60% female, 40% male, half human, half snake creature (which she incorrectly calls a black person) that gets [[Mpreg|pregnant]] and has a litter of bizarre little snake things. She's scared to death someone is going to [[Zeriara|steal and copyright]] her Red Venom idea before she gets a chance to make it into a [http://comments.deviantart.com/5/9059371/271458300 major motion picture] herself, even though [[lie|it's doubtful a story about a homosexual snake hermaphrodite that shits out eggs would be a big box-office draw.]]

She suffers from the dreaded [[Bishie syndrome]] and has a preference for [[vore]]/swallowing fetishes, [[pregnant|pregnancy]] fetishes (Mpreg especially), [[pedophilia]], [[guro]]/gore, violence with everybody present crying profusely and unrealistically, and of course, [[furry]] sex. She also seems to hate noses, though nobody knows why (perhaps because she can't fucking draw them).

[[Image:aintitthetruth.jpg|thumb|right|Snogger will not be trolled for trying to help! Even though she didn't try to help until AFTER being trolled. What a Saint!]]

She had a [[Gaia Online|Gaiafag]] who whored out overly priced commissions of other GaiaOnline [[avatar]]s. Seeing how many [[retard]]ed people are willing to pay for a [[shit]]ty chibi drawing gives Snapesnogger a case of [[unwarranted self-importance]], possibly because she's not yet as stupid as the people who pay her.

Overall, the only notable thing about Snapesnogger is that [[b|/b/]] considers her a [[Lol-cow|laughing stock]] and someone [[phished]] her for her username and password, then threw a nice copy of [[Tubgirl]] up on her front page. [[Lulz]] ensued as her equally worthless fanbase [[shit|shat]] themselves collectively.

==ART LULZ==

Snapesnogger likes to believe that she's the second most popular artist on [[DeviantART]] (following her idol [[Bleedman]]) and has so many fans/watchers because she's a great artist. While it's more probable that she's so popular because she draws [[kawaii]] [[chibi]] anime [[fanart]] and [[Mpreg]] [[slash]] from popular TV shows and movies on a site where [[weeaboo]] [[idiot]]s reign supreme, we'll let you be the judge:

==Fun Facts==
[[Image:Fucking confusing.jpg|thumb|Then again, she's not exactly clear on the subject herself.]]
[[Image:snapesnogger_iloveyourstuffdesu.jpg|thumb|Being a Snapesnogger fan is obviously a shame.]]

*Snapesnogger believes that the trolls hate her because she's [[internet celebrity|popular]]. Not because she's a [[attention whore|querulous]] little [[bitch]], but because she has several ass-kissing fannits. I'd use a metaphor here, but I rather feel using "Et tu, Brute?" to describe the way Snogger's weaksauce fannits will eventually turn and stab her in the back would be offense to Caesar.
*Snapesnogger will plug her ears, sing Fergie songs at the top of her lungs, and pretend she can't hear you when you attempt to tell her how much everyone hates her -- or at least the truth as to why -- then ban you and tell all her 'friends' not to believe anything you say. Ever.
*Snapesnogger hates all of her fans. The reason for this is that she finds herself too superior to relate to her "retarded fan base." In fact, Snapesnogger has actually taken a strong dislike to almost all humanity, believing that no living being could possibly measure up to her almighty skills at drawing androgynous, pregnant nagas and Severus Snape dressed like a furry.
*Though she claims she is not egotistical, she'll never think twice about telling you to fuck off if you call her [[truth|mediocre]].
*She will beg her fans not to kiss her ass and then, not five minutes later, turn around and ask for their "opinion" (read: pucker up, ladies).
*[http://comments.deviantart.com/5/14374328/527548810 Snapesnogger has had lesbian thoughts!]
*[[80s|Back in the day]], Snapesnogger was [[Lies|hired by Squaresoft]] to do the noseless artwork for the cult-hit game ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''.

{{quote|The bitch ruined my fucking religion.|Fadedfutures|losing his faith}}


This is without a doubt one of the most [[fucktarded]] things a [[fangirl]] can do: write a prayer -- or rather, take a [[Christian]] prayer and make it even more [[fail]] -- for one's own fetish.

And so, we feel a strong need to show you how Snapesnogger shits in the face of Religion and -- once again -- ruins the name of Severus Snape.
[[Image:SNIGGER RAGE.jpg|thumb|right|How Gemma responds to criticism.]]

<center>'''The Snape's Prayer!'''

<small>Our Severus, who art in hogwarts,

Hallowed be thy nose.

Thy caulrdon come.

Thy will be done,

On the astronomy tower as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily potion.

And forgive us our bad grades,

As we forgive those who curse our asses off.

And lead us not into detention,

But deliver us from evil.

For thou is the hotness,

[[Image:SnapeisDEVIANTART.jpg|left|thumb|Without Snapesnogger, there is no DeviantART]]
Her [[shit|fanbase]] strikes again as one devoted person swears up and down that Snapesnogger is DeviantART.  [[HAHAHA DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS|P-tecker]] has left his [[fag|faggotry]] all over her page, giving [[bullshit|every known fact out there]] to prove that she is [[fail|the best]] artist [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|in the world]].  He also has confessed his [[lie|undying]] [[Sex|love]] for her.

==OH NOES ART THEFT!==


===Venezuela===
[[Image:Snoggy-VenezualianArtTheft.jpg|thumb|She's laughing to hide her tears.]]
So when Stacey English steals Snogger's art, she flies into a [[batshit]] rage. However [http://snapesnogger.deviantart.com/journal/13895859 when a Venezuelan newspaper, a T-shirt shop in Canada, and some anime convention in Mexico hosted in a barn on a dirt farm does it] -- and makes ''money'' off of it -- Snogger is A-OK! Even honored!!

She doesn't have the sense to sue or ask for royalities from any of these people, even as they [[profit]] by using her [[shit]], thus proving that she will never make any money off her [[art]]. But she claims that as long as it's [[fanart]] and not her pregnant [[homosexual]] snake [[furry|furries]] or [[fucktarded]] angels (Who would use any of those for anything anyway, [[amirite]]?) that she doesn't care. 

It should be noted for the [[lulz]] that the Venezuelan newspaper ripped off the only thing that made Snapesnogger an [[internet celebrity]] in the first place.

Also, with this out in the open, she's pretty well given [[anonymous|us]] all the option to totally fuck around with her art! So sell it on DA! Sell it in your town! It's "lol, funny" according to Snoogy and she won't have any problem with it at all!

===Pudge03===
[[Image:Harry_Potter_by_pudge03.jpg|thumb|right|HOW '''DARE''' THEY[[oneoneone|!!!11]]]]
As Snapesnogger is ultimately a [[clusterfuck]] of confusion and [[fail]]ure, she baffles us once again. To sum it up:

* It's '''NOT OKAY''' for some random online person to ''steal her art and claim to be her''.
* It's '''A-OKAY''' for other countries to ''steal and sell'' copies of her [[crap]]py [[fanart]] ''[[IRL]]'' and not give her a single lick of credit or royalties.
* It's '''NOT OKAY''' for some random [[Tartlet]] to make a ''freehanded copy'' of her art and submit it to their gallery.

Recently, one of Snogger's brain-dead fans posted a comment to her userpage with a link to [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/42819613 a picture that was freehanded from Snogger's fucktarded Harry Potter chibi heads] and stated that the artist -- [http://pudge03.deviantart.com Pudge03] -- was 'trying to steal' it.

Upon hearing of such an unimaginable travesty as freehanding -- when one copies an existing picture entirely by hand (which differs it from tracing as there was actually effort put into it) -- two of Snogger's lackeys, as well as Snogger herself, went to confront the hapless Deviant and urge them to take down the picture or face being [[internet police|reported]]. This proves that Snapesnogger will forever be obsessed with petty [[shit]] that happens on [[the internet]] and it is a lost cause to try and teach her that [[real life]] should be more important. Thus far, it appears that the artist [[nobody gives a shit|doesn't give a shit]] and deviantART staff has yet to remove the picture.

What's particularly [[faggot]]y about this incident is that this is certainly not the only submission on deviantART that was made referencing Snogger's work and one has to wonder if she and her [http://uchiha-yuki.deviantart.com fucktarded weeaboo superfan] intend to scour the entire god damned website and report every single one of them, thus making more work for the lazy [[DeviantART]] staff and giving them yet another reason to hate her.

==Breaking News: Snapesnogger makes new DeviantArt account!==

Recently, Snogger [[Oh noes|created a new account]] on DeviantART to avoid all those who hate her and [[Truth|believe her work is complete shit]]. Being as [[retard|brilliant]] as she is, claiming to be [[butthurt|sick of drama]], [http://snapesnogger.deviantart.com/journal/15898247/#comments she posted the decision in her journal], in order to gather her [[fangirl|fantards]] in an [[attention whoring]] pity party. The latter smeared all the comments with so much failing sobs and hugs, that the server   went down, unable to cope with imbecility.
The sheer [[lame|lameness]] can be seen in the fact that she actually makes her fanbase to fucking dig up the site in search of her [[shitty art|zomg-precious artwork]], so to cause moar drama than ever. 

So, what did Snapesnogger do, and why did she whine that ED soon found her new hideout? Liek, posting utterly recognizable [[crap]] featuring her [[BFF|bestest]] male [[fag|lesbian]] [[lesbian|dyke]] [http://foofooboob.deviantart.com/ friend] (who was [[irony|too smart enough]] to add the [[fugly|abhorrent]] pieces of art to her fav), using the same avatards and mentioning ED in the fucking FIRST journal is TTLY [[Conspiracy|CANSPIRACEE]] LOL. 

Drama ensued immediately, and rages on. Despite all her claims of being [[Lie|mature]] and [[Bullshit|independent from fans]], this current [[lulz|lulzfest]] clearly depicts that nothing in the whole world will make Snogger moar than a hypocritical [[lolcow]], which hungers moar and moar pageviews, faves, and [[e-fame]], but still can't accept even an ounce of critique. 


So here's a link to [http://fluro-knife.deviantart.com/ her new account she doesn't want anyone to see]. The raiding/[[trolling]]/[[spamming]]/[[butthurt]] has already begun, because the creepy gay nagas and [[furfag|bunny]] [[fucktard]] people with saw-like teeth are just too obvious to ignore.
 
As always, she [[fail|hides comments as fast as shits art]], so [[screencap|scrncpzplzthx]] for great justice.

the epic lolcow has been spotted on deviantart yet again! http://fluro-knife.deviantart.com/

==NEW Account, NEW Fantards==

You would think that since the almighty Gemma has [[lie|changed for the better]] she would curb her creepy fetishes just a tad. NOT SO! 

[[Image:Kurugiro.jpg|thumb|left|Typical fanart of the Keroro Gunso series by Snapesnogger herself]]

===Bitter Truth can't be hidden===

Some people, seeing this unsurpassable [[faggotry]], tried to reason with Snogger, and of course, the comments were hidden with the speed of light. Thanks to GPRS, some of the [[Truth|wise]] words were saved, as to be an eternal reminder to the whiny shit's [[fucktard|fucktardness]].

{{squote|~-kitsune- 45 minutes 51 seconds ago 
Well now.
I was right, see? And you asked me, "How will my account be popular if nobody knows it?"
If you want peace, Gemma, don't create Deviantart accounts. Become a serious artist, if that's your desire, grow up, and leave the playground.

He's right, you know. You just... crave attention. But see, the problem is this: You have talent yes. You know it. And you rub it in your fans' faces. And that is the reason as to why you've become 'Bitter', to borrow your word for it.

Your art is lovely, yes. But see, you can't even climb out of your fairy tale illustration rut, as Knifeguy has pointed out.

You claim you want to grow as an artist: well, here's a tip. Most artists don't make their money drawing pretty, personalized, manga-esue pictures. They work and toil and slave for years to reflect their emotions, and the beauty they see around them.

You may have developed a style of your own, but in the long run, is it really that different from the thousands of other cartoon styles out there? No, it's not, and I'm sorry to say that, but it's not. You're never going to go anywhere in life with it unless you realize that you've stuck with it because it sucks in the fans. On the INTERNET.

If you want to improve as an artist, break away from what you KNOW works to pull people in, and try something different. DON'T post it on Deviant Art. Take it to REAL people with REAL opinions on how you can improve, and how you can grow as an artist. Break away from the 'children's book illustrations' style, and find something that is uniquely YOU, not a combination of everything you see in cartoons and on DeviantArt.

I draw my manga pictures because it's fun. Not because I want to suck the attention out of everyone around me.

It's time to grow up, Gemma, and face the real world instead of hiding in the shadow of DeviantArt, sucking the attention you so desire out of children and teenagers. To truly grow as an artist, it's time to ditch what you know works for you, and strive and sweat and toil for something better.| Kitsune-, trying to sugercoat the harsh reality}}

Of course, the Snogger couldn't bear the insults.

You know I've been playing the fool for a while now but I'm going to get serious with you for a moment, so listen up.
You're a real piece of work, you know that snogger? You run a tangent screaming that you want to be left alone, that you want to be a recluse, and go back to living in humility and develop as an artist; the sad fact of the matter is, you don't want that at all and you never want that. I point this out to plead with you to drop the act because you're not fooling anybody. You're just pissing everybody off more with your bullshit attitude.
'''
Just fess up already: you're a lying, bitter, stupid attention-mongering brat'''. This is what your popularity on DA has made you, and you relish in it. You don't strive for improvement because you know you don't have to when '''you're surrounded by as many morons as you are'''. And you like these morons, they re-enforce your childlike behavior and enable you to act like the spoiled little "starving artist" you pretend to be.

You know you have it pretty lucky for someone on the internet, which is a pretty backwards thing to say, but hear me out.''' Artists with TWICE the talent as you have to struggle TWICE as hard for recognition because all jerks like you have to do is pump out rosy pink pictures of their favorite character from their childrens novels--which they have since outgrown reading, like yourself--sucking the nads off some other ass from the novel, and instantly it is internet fodder for prepubescent perverts to oogle over'''.

To get more to the point (and pardon my language, I know you're SUPER SENSITIVE when anybody says anything MEEEAAN to you) '''you're a fucking sell-out and an insult to the artists community and don't deserve an inch's-worth of praise for the cookie-cutter factory work you pump out for attention'''.

Were you beaten as a child? Neglected? Did your mother not hug you enough or something? I ask because it seems to me like you're living vicariously off your artwork just for the attention. This might be because there's nothing about your personality--as displayed online, is obnoxious and wretched--that is at all redeemable. It's obvious you have self esteem issues, probably because you're not all that attractive and just about as likable in life as you are on the internet, which isn't very liked if you haven't noticed.
Maybe once you wise up in real life and start realizing that the internet doesn't owe you shit, just like the real world, you will come to terms with all the drama you've started AND contributed to and perhaps see from our point of view, '''why you are currently one of the most hated artist's personalities on the net'''.

I implore you to spend some time to reflect on yourself, because the more you try and hide in the shadows and the more you try to pretend to be "okay" with the way things are now, the worse you're going to become and the less you're going to improve, and the less people are going to be able to put up with you.

If you have any sign of maturity, '''if you have any sense of dignity or ANYTHING, you won't hide this comment and cower under your victim veil'''| Knifeguy's [[TL;DR]] attempt to surpass "Snapesnogger-Listen"}}

Seems like Snogger does NOT have dignity as the comment was hidden. As well as she has no logic either.


{{squote|Comment on *RavingG
~gaskrieger 41 seconds ago 
I applaud to you, sir Knifeguy. There are some very good points, and I want to add a few more.

Snogger's main problem is that she's really dependant on other people's ideas and personalities.

She doesn't produce original content, like a real artist does. In another way, she's behaving like your typical furfag. I'll explain.

First she thrived upon Snape. That's more or less normal for teen girl, to drool over an experienced harsh male character, and though she twisted him completely, turning the character into a gay chibi, it's understandable. But secondary.

Than the Red Venom and Angel 1000. That's where the furfaginess started to blossom. Snogger's trait is extreme lazyness and neglect. She announced two graphic stories, but what did she actually draw? 50% furfag reference sheets of characters, 40% depiction of luuurve poses of two male naga, and only 10% pictures to illustrate the key scenes of the nonexistent story. Obviously, this is because her moronic fantards are happy with reference cute sheets, and subliming your fantasies for a handsom naga is sooo easy. She's done like, 1 comic page and that's it, letting here fans imagine that she's "working hard on the story" when in reality she just posted every picture of Kave or whoever each time she decided to change the form of his horns.

Needless to say, nagas aren't her original creation.

Now, on to this foofoo bussiness. Again, the characters aren't hers. '''Foo and Bob are two lesbian dykes, which act like men on teh interwebz and created personas of demonic Gorillaz-like guys in bunny suits. Totally original and attractive, aint it?''' But for snogger it was just another gay manly ideal to '''fanfart''' over. And this time, in a fit of furfaggotry, she finally got the option to insert herself in her art, to finally sublime her wish for being a cute infantile snuggable creature. Again, she posts meaningless narcissistic "fabart", no plot, no ideas, only snippets.

That's what her art is. It's not fanart, it's not illustration. '''It's cartoonish masturbation to ownself and internet personas, and it has nothing meaningful or spiritual behind it'''.
And prepubescent teens gloat all over it just because they were spoiled by anime and are ready to love anything granted if it's TEH GAY.

btw, snogger, too late. I copied everything.| Gaskrieger, analyzing the [[shit|art]] and preserving the [[lulz]]}}

Get off the internet, now.

You've been on DA for what, three months now? And you have almost 600K reviews?

Of course, Gemma summoned up one brilliant reply:

==A New Chapter Begins==
A few days ago Snapesnogger announced that DA is no place for [[Teruchan|'professional artists']] to try and make a living (no shit). Now that Snogger [http://deviantWEAR.deviantart.com/art/Fire-Power-71622110 has crap printed on a t-shirt,] and SOLD her fucked up [[Over 9000|'over 9000']] inspired shirt, she is a pro, guys. Therefore, she no longer needs her legions of fans to make her feel like she is loved. In her recent journal little Snigger tries to bid a fake farwell:

{{squote|LOL I'm leaving this account :3 Don't worry, I'm not upset, rather i feel alot more relieved. 

I'm not leaving DA but I'm not mentioning the name of my new account either and please dont go out of your way to look for it. 

This account is turning me into [[emo|a bad bitter person]] and I've tried a long time to overcome the crap I've gotten and be brave XD; [[lie|me leaving is not a sign of me being weak.]] I was weak for clinging to this popularity that was twisting me into a piece of Crap.

I've realized with the friends i have and the urge to push forward with my work, i Dont need this DA account.

Snigger claims she no longer needs to feel consoled by her millions of pageviews. Obviously, she is full of shit, being the popularity whore she is. By creating a new DA account, Snogger is once again trying to run from her "drama", which she has always brought upon her stupid self. Running (or slithering, in Snogger's case) away from her once thriving hovel of kiss ass fans and numerous flames is going to solve her problems and get her moneys, obviously. Snogger admits that she was emo, at least, yet she still tries to hide it all and make herself seem like an hero and lie again when she says [[Lie|she has friends.]]

Snigger may believe her method of lowering her vendetta with [[Anon]] will work; whoever finds and posts the link to this new account will bring sweet, epic [[lulz]]. One may choose to interpret Gemma's disowning of her precious Snapesnogger account (and alias) a victory for [[nigras]] everywhere. Also notice Snogger's [http://snoggerific.com new, potential website] which has yet to be launched. Expect some horrible coding, nagas, and haxxing when she finally decides to finish it.

==Snapesnogger Returns!==

Being the whiny little shit she is, she came back to her original account as Snapesnogger tried to convince everyone the trolls did not faze her.  Apparently, they have no lives and are obsessed with her.  She claims she feels sorry for them because apparently she's not the one with the [[retard|mental condition]].  She goes on to say "i mean...i don't actually do anything bad anymore." Like the hidden constructive criticism and blocking everyone who is not a fantard do not count as "bad". 

She tries to lie by saying "''despite what some of you may do to try and bring me down, I will just take it in my stride. you people are making me stronger and stronger, what doesn't kill me can only help me in the future.''" Even though everyone knows she crawls into a corner and cuts herself every time someone says anything slightly negative about her [[shit|art]].

When a few reasonable people tried to get through her thick head and tell her she didn't get it at all, she tried to pull her usual "You don't know me!" bullshit. Amai-Nihachi succeeded in making Snogger use her RavingG account to reply on the Snapesnogger page. Realizing she made herself sound like even more of a retard, Snapesnogger promptly hid the comments, leaving her original TL;DR.  By doing this, it's obvious she thought she made herself look like the determined hero, instead of the fool.  Succeeding in making a fool of herself, someone reminded her by linking to this section of this article.

After the situation died down, Snogger found a link to a giftart of her character Gemma on her page.  The poor fantard Jerica-the-Angel was taken aback when Snogger blatantly refused the gift. Why?  Simply because Jerica-the-Angel said in response to Amai-Nihachi's "you don't get it" comment, "Don't you see Gemma? :( She's right.  I feel bad that you're going though this, but you have to listen :("  Needless to say, Snogger AKA RavingG jumped to her own defense and "yelled" at the poor fantard.

==I Nose Nagas - Snoggy Breaks Her New Year's Resolution==
[[Image:INoseNaga1.jpg|thumb|left|Snapesnogger trying to control who does and doesn't laugh at light-hearted pseudo-fanart.]]{{quote|heh you nasty bitch. [[noone|noone]] at niko's likes you,NO ONE!! everyone just bitches about how pathetic you were!|Snapesnogger|on showing her true colors}}
[[Image:INoseNaga2.jpg|thumb|[[moar]] related [[lulz]]]]
There were bad puns and [[butthurt]] for all when a particularly clever [[Template:DA|TARTlet]], [[Attention Whore|FoxNede]], cooked up a masterpiece called "I Nose Nagas" featuring a character resembling Snoggy's [[emo]] hermaphrodite [[fag]] in a Groucho Marx getup. 

The image was pretty harmless and light-hearted, but oddly, that's not what set Snoggy off, no. The picture didn't bother her but the people laughing at it did ([[LOL WUT]]). Just having a giggle was enough to set Snapesnogger off and get her bitching about cruelty and people hating her (her usual rap), thus predictably breaking her New Year's resolution. Only, you know, these weren't [[troll|trolls]] and [[your mom|meaniebutts]] so much as people just chuckling at a [[kawaii|cute]] drawing that Snoggy herself claimed she didn't find insulting.  

Though she threw a few insults at people (like the one above), devianTART deleted the ''artwork'' rather than banning her for her verbal attacks, since she's [[internet celebrity|popular]]. The system works. (Now if she had been spouting [[4chan]] [[meme|memes]] at the same time she would have been [[permabanned]].)

During her [[hissy fit]] she also insulted her fanbase, again, and yet they continue to lick her [[ass]] and beg for more:

[[Image:Snoggerretard.JPG]]

=GAIA LULZ=
If you've been living under a rock for [[at least 100]] years, you may not have noticed -- or perhaps just not [[nobody gives a shit|given a shit]] -- that Snapesnogger ALSO has a [[Gaia Online]] account (just one more milestone in her plot to [[Snapesnogger#External_Links|take over the internet]]). But one must remember that where there is Snogger, there is SURE to be [[lulz]]!

For example, she insists that she hates all the drama that surrounds her and yet -- like a fly on a [[Tubgirl|particularly foul]] pile of [[shit]] -- she just can't stay away. Witness for yourself the drama that actually ''preceded'' Snapesnogger on [[Gaia Online]] -- a site where [[fag]]s generally go to complain about [[Tartlet]]s:

[http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=23553207&page=1 Snapesnogger is a bitch -- Who knew?]

This thread was created in February 2007 just so people could bitch about Snapesnogger, which is practically a national pastime now. Interest died out after a while, and the last post was made on February 20th. However, after the thread was [[old meme|dead and gone]], Snogger (under one of her numerous Gaiafag accounts, "Jerrymalou") shows up -- NEARLY '''TWO MONTHS LATER''' -- and drags the drama right back up to the top of the forums.
 
[[Image:SnoggerGaia.jpg|thumb||center|650px|SHE'S NOT IN IT FOR THE DRAMA U GUYZ]]

[[anonymous|We]] thank you for insisting that everyone is a [[sick fuck]] just like you. Even if it were true, most of us still have the sense not to post [[gay]] [[anime]] [[furry]] [[porn]] and [[Harry Potter]] [[slash]] all over the [[internet]] (or in /b/'s case, not to post their own).


==Banned from y!Gallery==
[[Image:Snapesnogger_-_A_little_fun.jpg|thumb|left|The lovely picture responsible for Snogger's permaban. It would be really nice if someone could enlighten us as to what in God's holy name is happening [[faggotry|here.]]]]
On December, 22nd, 2006, Snapesnogger was banned from [[y!Gallery]] after a long period of continuous [[retarded]]ness and rule-breaking. The final straw was [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Image:Snapesnogger_-_A_little_fun.jpg a gratuitous and anatomically incorrect drawing] with a supposedly male character who, she quickly revealed, had a decidedly non-male vagina. Y!Gallery, being a site for lonely women and closet [[lesbians]] to share  their [[yaoi]] femmy male on male porn, is very anti-snatch.

She posted to her DA journal [[emo|complaining]] about the cruel mods and her [[bullshit|unfair treatment and 'frivolous' banning]], and added a touch of sour grapes by saying "Perhaps I don't like being stiffled[sic] by rules..." This has proven once and for all that in Snapesnogger's mind, [[common sense]] simply does not exist (and also that [[bitches don't know|bitch can't spell]]).

After a y!Gallery mod (who also happened to have a dA account) chastised her -- 1) for complaining when she knew perfectly well what the rules of the site were and yet broke them anyway, and 2) for thinking that because she was popular and had so many fans on y!G that she should be given [[hugbox|special treatment]] -- Snapesnogger replied, "its just a site, a stupid strict site. i wish i had seen it earlier. please dont send me anymore notes."

It should be noted that Snapesnogger's rule-breaking on y!Gallery included:
* [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Image:Snoggerban.jpg Lying about her age and signing up there before she had turned 18]
* Uploading copyrighted material for a club
* Harassing a moderator for drawing "[[lulz|offensive hick nagas]]" (which, as it turns out, had nothing to even do with her)
* Uploading an image that she stated was of ''her'' on deviantART but lied on y!Gallery saying it was just a "REALLY girly guy" (presumably because she didn't get her fill of favorites on dA and sought more from Y!Gallery)

==Forgiveness DENIED==
Despite how strict and stupid she thought the site was, just 2 days later, upon the introduction of a form to provide banned users with a chance to return to the gallery, Snapesnogger eagerly filled it out. Unfortunately, [[Admiral Ackbar|it was a trap]], and she was promptly redirected to this ED article.

She didn't seem to like this very much, judging by this message that was reportedly sent to a moderator:

{{quote|Also i would like to ad how fucking immature you stupid site is, the form of forgiveness? how come when i tried to submit a form it went straight to a site full of insulting stuff about me? how come? i suppose you and your nasty little mod friends think its hilarious? well its not!!! I TRY MY BEST TO IGNORE THAT FOUL ENCYCLOPEDIA DRAMATICA AND YOUR DUMB NASTY MALICIOUS SITE PUSHES IT IN MY FUCKING FACE???
YOU NASTY SICK ASSHOLES!!!|Snapesnogger, unleashing the fucking fury}}

And our response to it all:

{{quote|JUST AS PLANNED!|Everyone}}


==Banned from y!Gallery... again==
[[Image:Snoggeryban2.jpg|thumb|center|300px|wut!? CLEARLY THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PURSON! Also, lol that she faves a noseless chibi that looks just like her "unique" style.]]
On July 1st, 2007, Snapesnogger created a new account on y!Gallery using the name [http://yaoi.y-gallery.net/user/veserus/ Veserus] (and even rejoined one of her own clubs). So she hates the site's strict rules and believes the mods are all out to get her SO MUCH that she makes a new account to circumvent her banned one? [[FAIL|I think we all know what that means...]]

Less than 20 minutes after her first post to the site, she was banned again, thus proving that no matter what uninspired pseudonym you use, your retarded art style will always rat you out.


=The [[ConceptArt]] Incident=
[[Image:Mertashaandwynet.jpg|thumb|left| How dare they insult such [[bullshit|perfection?]]]]

[http://www.conceptart.org ConceptArt.org] is a place where serious artists -- many of them professionals or advanced students -- go to receive serious critiques of their work. Snapesnogger, in her infinite [[retardation|wisdom]], waltzed into this environment expecting a wave of the same demented praise and adoration she gets from her DA fangirls. Instead, she received a reasonable and honest critique of her image:

{{squote|I'm also having a hard time with the 60/40 gender percentage. Being a hermaphrodite/intersex or transgendered I get, but your character wants a male pronoun, looks male...but has babies? I'm not sure that's even plausible for the snake half. Is this founded in some sort of science, or just your own fantasy?

The twins looking completely different throws me too, but that's a whole 'nother scientific discussion.

I do like the drawing and coloring (in both pieces, though I'm partial to the marker version for some reason) for the human half and kids. The kids are very cute, and I really like the way you handled the eyes and hair. The snake half looks really lumpy though and the background looks flat and crowds the space of the piece. I think some work on volume might help in the future.|Mirana, actually being helpful}}

The response was, of course, sweetly reasonable:

{{squote|i really tried at this picture, why are you people so picky?!! im not being ignorant here, but it seems that im doing everything wrong all the time! and you dont know this character! he has a big profile on me and he means alot to me so dont question him. this isnt just to you, mirana, but everyone who is complaining. i like drawing manga, get over it! and the snake part does NOT LOOK LUMPY!!!|Snapesnogger, classy to the end}}

After this Snogger was pretty much reamed by ConceptArt goers (though some chose to simply admonish her, but the reaming is much funnier). [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=62767&highlight=snapesnogger/ The thread itself still exists] and is a fun read! Choice words from the pros:

{{squote|Oh, and we will not "get over" you liking to draw manga. Manga is a disease in many ways, because people think that they can become a great manga artist without a grounding in life drawing and such beforehand. This is not true. There are a few FANTASTIC manga artists who post here, and you can see in all of their work that they have done hundreds of hours of studies on realistic anatomy, lighting and colour, composition. Only then have they settled into their chosen style.

You have not done this, it is quite obvious. Your work is derivative manga. Outside your circle of DA friends, there is nothing to distinguish it from anyone elses derivative manga.|Give this man a Nobel Peace Prize}}

Snapesnogger ran back to deviantART in tears and complained in her journal (which makes it to the [[DeviantART]] [http://today.deviantart.com/ Today Page] every single time she posts one because of her dumbass fans) about those mean, judgmental professional artists who dared to judge her by artistic standards. Her fans obediently bashed ConceptArt, calling them elitists, assholes, and of course "jealous". 

To make matters worse, some other Snogger fans came into the thread to defend her from the harsh undeniable truth. One of these was some cunt with the predictable [[wapanese]] name " [http://yusagi.deviantart.com/ Yusagi] " who said some amazingly arrogant drivel such as:

*"''True talent doesn't require blood and sweat, and I don't know about Snogger, but I prefer to be taught by someone talented, than someone skilled--I can learn everything they know from a book.''"

*Favoring snoggers "art" over something decent like  [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=61557 this] with:

*"''What makes that so good? I personally find them to be nothing spectacular, in fact, I find them to be dreary, and the second woman to be unintentionally fat.''"  LOL WUT

Do try and troll her for the lulz.

Between ConceptArt and NagaMaster, Snoggy's journal garnered enough attention to appear in the "Top Journals" on the Today Page and thus drew a much larger crowd. People began criticizing her for acting like a spoiled brat and sullying the name of ConceptArt, so she deleted that journal and put up an identical one, where the criticisms continued (much to her chagrin). That second journal was also eventually deleted, but the incident fixed her in people's minds for life as a whiny, spoiled brat. Catchphrases from her CA encounters such as "What a naga is..." "I know nagas," and "the snake part does NOT LOOK LUMPY!!!" have since caught on as Snogger memes.

This [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] [[article]] even earned [[ConceptArt]] a few new members! [http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=85352&highlight=snapesnogger][http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=89065&highlight=snapesnogger][http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=93194&highlight=snapesnogger]

=YOUTUBE LULZ=

Snogger now has a [http://www.youtube.com/user/snapesnogger YouTube account] where she submits shitty picture slideshows (which she incorrectly calls animations) and five minute videos of her producing those [[shit]]ty pictures. Since it is all anime Harry Potter fanart, and the background [[music]] for her videos includes selections from [[Avril Lavigne]] and [[faggot|Nick Lachey]], she's sure to be a big hit.

It should be noted that Snapesnogger --due to [[flame]]s -- has deleted her more notable YouTube submissions including:
[[image:DADDY!! D8.png|thumb|left|Father must be so proud.]]

* A 30 second [[emo]] weeaboo picture slideshow about [[fags|Snape and Lily]] set to an [[gay|Avril Lavigne song]] that she claimed to be an "animated movie."
* A 12 hour long slideshow of every Snape picture she has [[over 9000|EVER shat out]] -- set to a Nick Lachey song -- as a testament to her loyalty as a fan and to show off [[bullshit|how much she's improved over the years]]. (see right for a sample)
* A [[movie|"video"]] of [[media:snapesnogger_spastic.wav|Snapesnogger being a fucktard]] with her sister (which consisted of [[shit]]ty scribble stills to "illustrate" an audio file). You can still find the audio on Snapesnogger's [[FurAffinity]] account. [http://www.furaffinity.net/view/325527/] See if you can tell which one's Gemma!

The following is the only video remaining on her account. [[Troll]]ing the Hell out of that shit is still highly recommended so that [[the internets]] may be rid of ''it'' as well.

[[Image:Cap2.JPG|thumb|right|ONOES]]
[[Image:Voldelol.JPG|thumb|right|Well, thereâs one crapfest I don't have to read.]]
[[Last Thursday|A few weeks ago]], [[FCTC|FCTC]] (Foocy Toocy/Fried Chicken Trolling Crew) posted a video on YouTube (now deleted by staff) and linked to it on Snogger's page as well as used it for a video response to her submissions. The video seemed innocent enough, featuring [[Harry Potter]] art...but then a video-cap of [[Meatspin]] pops up.

FCTC then proceeded to [[spam]] the hell out of her page with spoilers from the final book of the series.

Snapesnogger's immediate response was to make a deviantART journal (see Fig. 1) threatening to "delete all the snape art and get a new account" if it turned out that <s>[[The Great Dumbledore Dies Meme of 2005|Snape killed Dumbledore]]</s> Snape was evil. [[Anonymous]] rejoiced as he knew that <s>[[old meme|Snape did in fact kill Dumbledore]]</s> Snape was probably [[gay|evil]], but solemnly as Snapesnooger has made threats to leave the [[internet]] before.

As [[anonymous]] predicted, Snogger released a journal the next day apologizing for being a [[fag]] (see Fig. 2). And as it turns out, anonymous' hopes got [[rape|fucked]] since Snape was proven to be ''good'' -- as "good" and "[[your mom]]'s creepy stalker" apparently mean the same thing in the [[Harry Potter]] universe).

Snapesnogger's [[fan]]base (aka the half-assed G-Fanforce) is composed of [[16-year-old girl|belligerent little praisers and worshipers]] who kiss her ass so much that she won't actually LEAVE the god damn website -- no matter how much [[anonymous|others]] may hope for it. She has [[deleting your LiveJournal|threatened to leave]] the site [[at least 100|at least 48 times]] but every time these annoying little fucks convince her to stay.

Also, if this page is suddenly blanked or says "SNAPESNOGGER IS AWESOM U PPL R A BUNCH OF FAGS[[oneoneone|!!!11]]" you know that her [[Tegaki E|fanhorde]] has been here.

Truthfully, though, this page is dedicated to her fans, [http://comments.deviantart.com/1/34796759/272906210 whom she has lovingly referred to as "sheep" on more than one occasion]. If not for them, we would never have run across such a wonderful lolcow.

==Fan Gallery==
Snapesnogger's fans pride themselves (read: fall all over themselves) on presenting to her the most amazing and lavish of giftarts depicting her [[bullshit|engaging]] original characters. Behold!

Now, given the average artistic skill of her fans, one can see why Snapesnogger's formulaic, poorly composed drawings with no stable sense of lighting, proportion, or color are considered "good".

Snapesnogger seems to have abandoned her fake Naga story, the only post on her new account related to Red Venom being her FORMER 60%female 40%male character, who has [http://owlgem.deviantart.com/art/Mercury-74898456/#comments since been changed into a lady snake-thing, boobs and all.] This was met with much anger from her fanwhores, who accused her of being a sell-out. Good to know they finally caught on.

==No more [[kawaii]]? ):==

In a startling turn of events, Snapesnogger seems to be wanting good comments instead of [[bullshit]] ones! But most of us know that she's just trying to feed us [[moar]] crap and trying to cover up past [[drama]].
