Ohio
[[Image:Brianpeppers.jpg|thumb|Actual Ohio Citizen]]
'''Ohio''' is a shithole excuse of a state in the [[Jewnited States]], in [[shit nobody cares about|Middle America]]. It is known for its [[fat|mass]] export of ''Drew Carey''. Ohio is widely known for having four unique seasons -- almost winter, winter, still winter, and construction.
Ohio is also famous for having one of the highest populations of white supremacists, hicks, and retards (Unlike ED, they [[SRSLY]] believe Obama's a [[Muslim]]), due to its close proximity to [[Indiana]] and [[West Virginia]].
A favorite attraction of Ohio is creating moon-crater-sized [[goatse|potholes]] that rival [[Pennsylvania]]'s. Since it's so craptastic, no one bothers to fix them.
It's known for having three of the shittiest cities in America (and that's saying something): [[Cleveland]], Dayton, and Columbus. Only [[Detroit]], [[New Orleans]] (the black parts), and [[Baltimore]] are worse. Other than [[Toledo]] (which isn't really so much "shitty" as it is unremarkable) all the other "cities" in Ohio are small towns filled with midwestern hicks that [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about]].

'''Note to Eurofags''': Don't bother using Ohio as an example of [[Why do you hate America?|why America sucks]]. <s> Ohio is the butt of every joke ever here. [[Srsly]], everyone hates Ohio and Ohioans (yes, that's what you call them). </s> Because [[Detroit]] is way worse.

== Population ==
[[Image:Cloud8745.jpg||thumb|right| [[Youtube_nobodies#Cloud8745|A major Ohioan city is on this man's chest.]]]]
Ohio is home to a [[lie|wide variety of interesting people]], from the college [[student]]s at [[College|Ohio State]] to the [[Old people|elderly]] at CGNU. At least 50% of OSU students are [[fag]]s, while the other 50% are [[arab|towelheads]]. The population is often bitter, due to their [[fail|inability]] to drive properly, their close proximity to [[Michigan]], and their all-around vacant space.

It is a common misconception that Ohio allows [[lulz]]; but like [[Boston]], Ohio hates lulz. Because they're all insecure about the fact they live in a crappy little state, if you ever try to fabricate, discuss, or terminate [[lulz]] you will be [[v&]] for attempting to have fun.
