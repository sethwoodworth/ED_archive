Project Manager: Chad Andrew Syphrett

:icondeviantcommunity: The Deviant Community Project will be managed & sponsored by people, who acknowledge & appreciate Chad A. Syphrett's requests to DeviantART-Staffers & their kind volunteers:

[1] Stop Stalkers & Harassers at DeviantART.com:
Kindly address the DeviantART-Staffers: Tell them that we wish they would make this website better by banning obvious harassers & stalkers, who make false-reports against artists at this website, even though they have NO PROOF to back up their claim of "art-theft" & other common art-related crimes.


[2] Expose False-Reporters & Harassers At DeviantART.com:
We urge the DeviantART-Staffers to share the identity of the reporters to those, who have been reported by them. The accused deserve to know, who is accusing them. We know that ALL inappropriate & false-reports (especially rude comments) made at this DeviantART come from stalkers & harassers (AKA "trolls" with multiple-accounts).

[3] Prevent Harassers From Opening Multiple-Accounts At DeviantART.com: Since many of us have problems with stalkers & harassers, who may hate the artwork or opinions we share at this site, we plead with the DeviantART-Staffers to block and ban the IP-addresses of obvious harassers, who have opened more than 1 account stalk & insult meek artists & innocent victims at DeviantART.com

[4] DeviantART-Community Chatroom For Reporting Harassment: We would like to kindly ask DeviantART-Staffers to make a chatroom, which would be open 24/7 for victims of stalkers & harassment. We ask for the staffers to please assign moderators & volunteers, who can instantly be available for any of the kind DeviantART-members, who wish to chat with DA-moderators or volunteers, who can immediately stop the harassers as soon as they receive reports from members in the Deviant-Community chatroom.

[Request] Please kindly ask the DeviantART-Staffers to work together with Chad A. Syphrett on DeviantART-Community Projects.

Since many of us have problems with stalkers & harassers, who may hate the artwork or opinions we share at this site, we plead with the DeviantART-Staffers to block and ban the IP-addresses of obvious harassers, who have opened more than 1 account stalk & insult meek artists & innocent victims at DeviantART.com|2=deviantcommunity|3=http://deviantcommunity.deviantart.com/journal/28522330/#comments|color=silver|size=360%}}
