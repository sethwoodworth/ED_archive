Taxidermy
[[Image:Taxidermy.gif|frame|It's not murder if it's not human.]]
The process of producing rugs or life like three-dimensional replicas of a previously killed [[furry]] (often killed at a [[fursecution|fox hunt]]), for the purpose of display. 

==Description==
As [[furries]] are animals rather than humans, the laws prohibiting [[murder]] and (in some states and countries) [[rape]] do not apply, providing the [[furry]] is in season. After the effort of [[stalk]]ing the [[furry]] back to its basement and shooting it (a process known as ''hunting''), the ''hunter'' will often seek to commemorate the effort expended by taking the carcass to a taxidermist.

In the case of a model the taxidermist will freeze the carcass and then take casts from the body parts, before crafting a model usually from fibreglass and other man-made materials; often only the [[furry]]'s skin is incorporated into the reproduction. 

For a rug the process is simpler; the [[furry]] is skinned and decapitated, with the skin being subsequently tanned. A mold of the [[furry]] skull is then inserted into the skin in place of the original.

Once the process is finished, the proud hunter will then often display their new trophy in a prominent place around the house, providing an interesting and stimulating conversation piece for parties and social gatherings.

If you are in dire need of many, many rugs (read: hundreds), then we suggest you consult [[Furcadia]].
It's almost [[fursecution]] season! Start early with Ravynwolf! She's [[childfree]], as well as a [[furry]]!
