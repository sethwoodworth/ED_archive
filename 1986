Dad's dog's leg
'''Dad's dog's leg''' (DDL), is an [[anonymous]] [[retard]]-[[troll]] who struck [[LiveJournal]] in 2006. The troll focused his attacks on LJ's popular "secrets" [[community|communities]], where members posted confessions of sexual fantasies, perversions, obsessions, sins, violence, and crimes. 

DDL commented on almost every entry, each time stating a different piece of information regarding his dad's dog's leg. Stories include reincarnation, rape, molestation, and eating. The members of the communities either lash out with [[WTF]], or praise him anonymously. 

Profilers believe DDL to be [[Chris-chan|a white male in his mid-twenties, overweight, and unemployed]]. His fame was relatively short-term, but created [[lulz]] for all observers while it lasted. 

Some examples of DDL's work:
