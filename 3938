Iambic pentameter
'''Iambic pentameter''' is a common meter used in English [[poetry]], most famously by Shakespeare. A normal person might think this obscure and [[boring]] subject could not produce [[drama]] on the [[internet]], not knowing that poets are second only to [[Music|musicians]] in their [[fucktard|fucktardedness]]. References to iambic pentameter are often used in literary discussion to demonstrate [[intellectual]] superiority, generate [[lulz]], or [[pwn]] [[emo]]s.

**"Proper English is nice and all, but you simply cannot make a case that it's as interesting or fun as speaking the language of the great inner-city minds: MCA, Adrock, and Eazy Mutherfuckin' E. In my view, this is no different than a parent introducing his child to Shakespeare except that the iambic pentameter is replaced by a framework of [[Motherfucker|profanity]], misogyny, [[Drug|substance abuse]], violence, retaliation, crime and infidelity. (Which, if you think about, sounds a lot like Macbeth.)"

**"Discuss? Theories? Everything I know is an irrefutable FACT, and the rest of you clods just haven't caught up yet. And I fucking HATE iambic pentameter. That fifth beat just hangs there, waiting for the other three to roll around so you can start the next line. Stupid beat...thinks it's so smart...mmm, donuts." -- Seedy
