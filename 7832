Stickdeath
[[Image:Stickdead.GIF|right|thumb|There are [[over 9000]] animations on stickdeath, and all of them end like this.]]

Stickdeath is a site created by the Rob Lewis after he got his ass kicked out of [[Newgrounds]] for being such a terrible excuse for a [[flash]] animator.  His site attracts [[13 year old boys]] who have just discovered the [[internets]] on their [[dell]] desktop using [[AOL]] version 17.  The site began in 1998 when he made a ground-breaking internet first: he made a .gif animation of a blue stick figure killing a green one.  This depiction of stick [[racism]] changed the face of internet animation forever.

==Content Creation==
Rob's artistic talent begins with him spending 7 hours sketching his masterpieces in [[MS Paint]].  When the sketches are done, the frames are printed out on a dot matrix printer.  Once meticiously inked with a sharpie, he then holds them over the computer monitor so he can trace them in his hacked copy of [[flash]].  He then listens to [[shit band|Drowning Pool]] at max volume while slamming down 6 beers, and finishing it off with a fistful of tylenol 3's.  Thrashing the keyboard, he animates the blue stick to kill the green stick in an original fashion.  He puts in the final touches of his animations by making at least 100 [[Metallica]] references as well as subliminal [[conservative]] messages, all while laughing at the latest Iraqi body count on [[CNN]].
