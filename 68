'''"Hey Patrick, I thought of something funnyer than 24..."'''

'''24chan''' is a [[*chan]] site started by a [[retard]] named Eric. He started the site on August 19, [[2008]] on the [[Jewish|budget]] host ''Netfirms''. A few hours after he started the site he was told "[[GTFO]] or we will send out the [[partyvan]]", so he had to remove all the [[Porn|porn]]. With the support of two unique posters he decided he'd keep the chan alive by spending all of his yearly allowance on real hosting.

The idea of 24chan came to Eric [[last Thursday|the day before it was created]]. The actual name 24chan was chosen after he checked every domain from 0 to 32chan.org, and only 22, 24, and 32 we available. The first night the board consisted of just /b/ running on the [[Shit|Wakaba script]], currently the board runs on [[trevorchan|kusaba]].

===In Need of a Good Raping===
One day, the moderator Lami decided to pursue a new lease on life, and decided to make forays into [[4chan]] in the /tg/ board. Finding an online D&D game, she soon learned that she and the players would not get along and soon, using [[google|epic hax]], her true nature was unearthed.

Which story did you read?: Survey<br/>
This was going to go in your survey but it appears theres some kind of error, I cant send it to you that way. so here it is this way.<br/>

Well I'm not a man, but I really think the stuff you do is awsome, I myself have a rape fetish. I think it can at times be nearly romantic, For me Rape is always very empathetic for the girl. Like you, I think it's a [[LOLWUT|Mans right to rape us, but also that we should do our best to bring people who are man enough to rape us as much pleasure as possible]], they deserve to engourge their hard dicks in a pussy that will squeeze them back.

to me Rape isnt entirely a [[Logic|non consentual thing]], To be raped means that Your being fucked how they want to fuck you, like it or not, often I prefer it to be more non consentual though, just out of classic taste,

Another thing I love about rape is its a far cry from the sorted porn that exist nowdays. Its more real to me, theres pain, I'm not exagurating the pleasure, sobing crying and whimpering are all much more exciting than just simply shouting out Oh YEAH over and over.

I've been molested but never truely raped. I keep praying, "cmon while I'm young here"

Often I think With him brutaly raping me, and then spilling all that sperm into my tummy, Maybe I'll get pregnant, I guess that also really turns me on. Light tieing on my hands behind my back is also really good. That way I cant resist no matter what. And it looks very sexy that way.

I guess the only thing i dont entirely agree with you on, Is your taste in men :P I Prefer longer hair, Well, even after that I'm pretty much pansexual. If someone has a big enough Penis that can hurt me at least a little while they rape me, Then I dont care if its a [[furry|Tigerman]] or a Dickgirl.

Heres to hoping someone out there is man enough to bend us over and plunder their pleasure from our pussies, Thats why we are here.

Oh and heres to hoping this little bit wasnt a waste of time, I know it wasnt exactly scary. well, maybe my grammar is.

===Radio 24chan===
Radio 24chan was launched on September 7th, and died 2 days after.

===The Netfirms Incident===
After about 18 hours into 24chan's life [[Freewebs|Netfirms]] noticed the huge bandwidth cut they were taking, so they decided to investigate. They stumbled upon the /fap/ board and then proceeded to threaten suspension, or [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|delete the images]]. Here is a transcript of the e-mail that was sent.

{{Quote|Hello,

===IRC===
24chan has an IRC server which isn't used by anyone, since [[Underage|most of the users]] have no idea how to use an IRC client, so a web client was added. The IRC is located at irc.sinirc.net #24pylons. And nowadays people actually talk since the chat merged with [[Additional Pylons]]

===Mascots===
*<s>24tan</s> After a unanimous vote by the mods it was decided that she would be murdered then raped, but she was hit by a car before that could happen.
*<s>24failguy</s> Received the [[banhammer]] of justice.
*<s>Anal-Man</s> no

=== Being framed by [[IMG!]] ===
For some reason, the members of 24chan were blamed for the recent [[owned|DDoS]] of [[IMG!]]. No one understands why, but [[faggot|Tahko]] continues to blame them, try to set them up, and fabricate fake IRC logs/screen shots. 24chan will never be able to win the argument with [[faggot|Tahko]], so they've recently told him to fuck off, and they left it at that, other than the picture on the front page of 24chan. (This picture is also in the gallery, below.)
(LOL, pwnt)
