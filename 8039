{{Lj|user=Tawneelynne}} is a general nutbar from the [[Seattle]] area. She is well known for her [[Porn|photography]] which is mainly on the subject of flowers (both botanical flowers and the [[Cunt|flower of her womanhood]]) whose pictures have often fetched [[At_least_100|at least a hundred]] dollars. The drama ignited when she was banned from [http://seattle.livejournal.com/ LJ community Seattle]. In an attempt to gain sympathy, she told everyone she has leukemia and a [[Brokeback Mountain|broken back]], among other things. A member of our [[flist|friend's list]] later exposed her and sent some screen shots to [[Jameth|jameth]]. It was also found out that she has abandoned her two children and is now hiding from her ex-husband in order to avoid having to pay child support, which has accumulated to $30,000 after the past six years.

[[Image:TawneeLaugust20061.jpg|thumb|right|hello teh internets, i am teh sex]]
When exposed, Tawneelynne began accusing jameth of [[stalk]]ing her and threatening his flist with [[Internet lawsuit]]s, which resulted in [[A Plus|A+++]] [[lulz]]. However, as a seasoned [[Dramacrat|drama veteran]], jameth quickly got bored and banned her from commenting on his jernal, so she set up another account to evade the ban while still accusing jameth of stalking.

When she isn't hamming it up on LiveJournal, Tawneelynne enjoys taking nude photographs of herself in various contortions, despite having a three herniated discs in her spine! What a trooper! Many photos of [[vagina|flowers]] and her unbroken back are available [http://www.flickr.com/photos/magikal_solutions/ at her flickr account].

After repeated attempts at blanking this page failed, Tawnee took her butthurt to, of all places, [[Abuse lj abuse]]. She was lulzed out of the community until she deleted the post. Pretty much every ED admin got in on it, and [[at least 100]] people died from a [[lulz]] attack. [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/media/saved/tawneelynne_in_abuse_lj_abuse/76689.html Luckily, our Queen saved a copy.] Tawnee then ran to TOW, thinking they would save her[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/MONGO#Statement_By_TawneeLynne]. 

Tawneelynne is not to be confused with Tawnee Stone. Tawnee Stone is someone you actually ''want'' to see naked.

[[Image:Tawneelynee.gif|thumb|A lifetime exclusive. If you think this is [[funny]] you are a [[fuck]]. Mmk?]]

Adding to the lulz, Tawneelynne is also an [[otherkin]] who thinks she is a faerie (not by choice, but by spirit!).

Memorable quote regarding her noodz: 
<blockquote>
Is it wrong that I would still treat her shotgun wound of a shaved snatch like my own personal cum dumpster? <br><br>The fact that she thinks she's a 'faerie' is kinda disturbing, and she's clearly insane, but I'd still cum all over her pink asshole. <br><br>-[[Anonymous pussies|anonymous]]
</blockquote>

==Tawnee ED PotN fame==
Tawnee became the ED [[ED:PIC|Picture of the Now]] on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:PicoftheNow/October, 2006|October 2, 2006]]. We let her know, lol.

"[[Tawneelynne]] is a <s>general nutbar</s> raving psychotic from the [[Seattle]] area."

== Problemata dramatica ==
[[Image:Tawneelynnecap.jpg|thumb|left|Don't believe everything you believe on the internet~!]]
Tawnee suffers from a plethora of personal issues (humility not being one of them), which include:

# 2004-09-28 [http://community.livejournal.com/seattle/2000051.html Broken shoulder, leukemia, neutropenic, stolen car] 
# 2005-07-16 [http://community.livejournal.com/seattle/2779381.html Breast cancer]
# 2005-08-28 [http://community.livejournal.com/seattle/2892949.html Herniated discs]           
# 2005-08-28 [http://community.livejournal.com/seattle/2892949.html Had to shut down her business because of injuries] 
# 2005-10-24 [http://www.robont.net/archives/2005/10/mmmmmmmmmm_tawn.html#more Posting naked pictures of herself on the internet]
# 2005-11-07 [http://robont3.livejournal.com/75869.html Twice]
# 2006-04-20 [http://community.livejournal.com/philly_bdsm/22173.html Leukemia, was given 9 months to live, homeless, no family]  
# 2006-05-14 [http://community.livejournal.com/ballard/73655.html Car broken into and equipment stolen]

# 2006-12-04 [http://tawneelynne.livejournal.com/442868.html OH NOES SHE'S BEEN RAPED!] Her definition of rape seems to be "anyone who has loaned me money who finds me and demands I pay that money back as promised."

Unfortunately, Tawneelynne decided to whine to [[LJ Abuse]] that these things she posted were somehow harassing to her. LJ Abuse forced the community moderators and even private journal owners to allow her to delete or modify them. Some were saved by ED staff before their removal, some were not. If you have copies, please contact [[Special:Listusers/sysop|an ED Sysop]] who will host the copy here and assist in removing your name if needed.

[[Image:153950888 3bd73e8883.jpg|thumb|right|Notice the screams of agonizing pain as the latissimus dorsi ruptures under the pressure of carrying a broken back and 3 herniated discs.]]
Tawneelynne promptly took [[Jameth]] to [[internet court]]. [[Hardvice]], [[attorney at lol]] then posted his worst [[internet defense]] case to date. The result was a tie to the previous world internet record of $10,000 for largest internet settlement. Tawnee is expected to use the money to cure her leukemia.

Hi everyone, ummm, this is a message to Aaron. Ummm, I don't know what to say. It's been 6 years and in that 6 years I've grown a lot and I still have a lot of growing to do.
[[Image:Tawneenood01.JPG|thumb|right|OMGZ]]
I have a [[Internet disease|disorder]] called [[bullshit|post traumatic stress disorder]] and I don't know what, what, what happened in our [[rape|marriage]]. I mean, I do, I know some things, I know some [[fact]]s, I know some things. I know [[sex|my side]], but I also know that my side is [[O RLY?|screwed up]] because, because my father [[lol|abused]] me and when, when you would say things that would trigger a memory I would go into a flashback, and I didn't know it, I didn't know what was going on. And so I have [[whore|a problem]] now with knowing what's [[suicide|right]] and what’s [[attention whore|wrong]] from way back then. What I do know is that I felt like [[winnar|you beat me]]like my father did. I felt like there was no way that I could win from my abuser and I felt like you had abused me.

Now I'm sure that you have a different side to it and I can stand in responsibility if I'm wrong, but it was how I saw it at the time. And I don't know [[I did it for the lulz|what else to say about that]].

But what I do know is that I went and I tried to change everything that they said I was doing wrong in the [[Internet court|custody hearing]]. About not having roots about umm  not  having my life together  and I've tried for [[At least 100|six years]], I've tried, I've tried to change everything that was [[everything|wrong with me]] then so that I could come back and I could be a part of my boys life and be a [[Your mom|mom]]. And I knew that you weren't gonna let me do that until I changed or at least that's what I’ve [[Drugs|made up in my head]]. I've also made up in my head that you're a danger to me, based on [[Intelligent people can spell|what I experienced in our marriage]]. And part of that was based on  flashbacks that I was having so I don't know what else to say Aaron, except that [[lies|I'm sorry]] and that I just know that [[pedophile|I really want to be a part of my boys life]]. I don't know what hoops you want me to jump through I don't know what you expect me to say or how I can validate how you feel, but whatever it is, I will do it so that I can see my boys Because I never wanted to [[Quitting IRC forever|go away]], I just made up in my head that I had no other choice.

So there are people on my [[friends list]] who have offered to be [[Lawyers at lol|mediators]] that [[NPOV|aren't taking sides]], who realize my [[Asperger's syndrome|battles]] and my [[santorum|challenges]] and that realize it will be hard for me to deal with you directly based on [[H8|all the emotion]] form our past. And [[they]]'ve offered to be [[sock puppet|mentors]] and my only request is that [[WTF|you just tell them whatever you need to tell them and let them know and let them come back to me and let me know so that I can give you whatever it is that you want so that I can see my boys, please.]]
[[Image:Tawneenood02.JPG|thumb|right|Pictures of flowers]]
I do have [[safeword|boundaries]], I do not want you back in my life, I do not think it would be healthy for any of us for you to be back in my life, but I believe [[Thirteen year old boy|our boys]] deserve both parents in their life. I never felt any different, that's why I let you see them, that's why, because they deserve that, I never kept them from you, I never not let you be around your boys. I don't regret the decision and I am thankful that you have taken such good care of them, while I have had to go off and find out how to be [[drama bomb|healthier]].

Uhhh, so anyway, I have to [[death|breathe]], and I am going to go out and try to hang out with some [[luser|friends]] right now, I have to get [[waambulance|a break from this]], because I'm really [[fucktard|challenged]] with a lot of things right now and my boys would be a [[suicide|good thing for me]], if you would just let us have a part of each others lives. 

Anyway, so that's all, that's all I have to say. I hope that you find a way for us to meet in the middle. Thanks.

== Update ==

As of July 21, she explodes onto the scene in [http://qweerdo.livejournal.com/283909.html qweerdo's journal], replete with DMCA threats and claims of disability, and not being a deadbeat mom, despite owing $30,000 in child support. 

NEW CATCHPHRASE: [http://jameth.whatthefuck.com/july2006/tawnee.jpg ''we had to call the police last night because some huge guy was threatening to gang bang me, whatever that fucking means. ''] In other words, she was [[almost raped]] by [[futhman]].
