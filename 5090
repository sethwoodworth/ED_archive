'''Max "Natalie" McBride''' is a twice-desysopped Wikipedian, [[Bureaucratic Fuck|angsty]] [[fag]], and [[troll|Wikitroll]] extraordinaire. His specialities include "[[Vandalism|protecting]]" [[BLP|biographies of living people]], running database [[Hacking|queries]], pissing off [[Durova]] in any way possible, and making [[Aspie]] [[Wikipedo]]s scream like little girls.

McBride is a renowned cross dresser. Past names on [[IRC]] have included [[Trap|Annemarie, Marybelle, and Eloise]]. His [[BFF]] is [[LaraLove]]; the two can usually be found editing pages [[Sex|within seconds of one another]]. McBride is also best [[fag|buddies]] with [[MyWikiBiz|Gregory Kohs]] and delights in selling admin accounts, database [[Shit|dumps]], and his love to the Kohster.

Gregory Kohs and Max McBride have frequent [[Meatspin|meetups]] in Washington, D.C., [[Ohio|Cincinnati]] and the ''[[Wikipedia Review]]'' where they plot the demise of the [[Wikipedia Jews]]. Little does McBride know that Kohs is a Jew himself.

McBride is an Wikipedo admin who actually [[Lulz|vandalizes]]. McBride once had a page in his user space called "So you've decided to go rogue". It was a how-to manual for the Wikipedia [[admin]] on how to use admin tools to trash Wikipedia. Needless to say it was censored by [[butthurt]] Wikipedos. No worries! [[MZMcBride/Going Rogue|You can view the deleted content here]].

== Wikicourt cases ==
MZMcBride was sued twice in [[Arbcom]]. In the first one, he went on a lulzy deletionist rampage against "Secret Pages" and other "Game Pages", places where Wikipedoes engage in [[Pedophilia|tomfoolery]]. These pages are central to the Wikipedia's user [[Rape|interactions]] since they are basically playgrounds where the admins can molest kids and other underlings. Therefore, the butthurt Wikipedos sued MZMcBride in Arbcom. 

The second time, McBride was sued for giving lists of unwatched BLPs over to the banned sockpuppet [[Gregory Kohs]] to vandalize. It turns out that Gregory Kohs had a [[Lulz|sockpuppet who was a sysop]]. McBride was found out by the ever so watchful Arbcommies and dragged through a court circus a second time where the Wikipedia Jew Durova got her chance to pounce on him.

Regardless of how many times McBride goes to Wikicourt, McBride will always end up winning regardless of what kind of sanctions [[Arbcom|they]] impose upon him. This is because he is [[doing it for the lulz|in it for the lulz]].
