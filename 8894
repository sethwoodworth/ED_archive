'''War''' is any event of prolonged violence and other [[serious buisness]] that isn't really meant to be funny but often is. According to [[W|Boy George]] (a [[British]] ambassador in the [[1980s]]), war is stupid and [[people]] are stupid. But most [[people]] love war, especially [[German]]s and [[Cumrag|Cumraqiis]]. War in [[America]] helps to stimulate patriotic love for the [[president]] and [[your mom]], and everyone gets more [[pie]]. In [[England]], war leads to the creation of much [[lulz]] as war-time humour about soldiers dressed up as ladies and eating dehydrated eggs flourishes. This is because the English, having already crammed themselves up their own assholes, have effectively made any further penetration by their opponent's genitalia practically impossible. If it wasn't for war, a lot of the great toys we take for granted today would never have been invented (e.g. bows and arrows, hand grenades, stink bombs and [[special forces|combat camouflage barbie dolls]]). Since the late [[1990s]] the glorious and [[epic]] nature of warfare has been reduced to [[guido|fist pump]] dance contests, battles that only include freestyle [[rape|rapping]], and an axe is now a [[rock|guitar]].

==History==

War is mostly fought on a fixed [[video games|game map]] of little to no variety, usually limited to City map, Desert map, and Jungle map and on rare occasions Sea map and Air map. In the 1970’s an [[indie|independent]] third party [[American]] game designer, in joint effort with  [[Soviet]] [[basement dwellers]], was working on a [[Space]] combat expansion pack called [[Star Wars|Project Star Wars]], but the project was scrapped because the official Game Studio threatened to shut down the War server and kill all the [[lulz]] if any [[illegal|unauthorized]] expansions were ever sold. This rubbed everyone the wrong way and ever since then all the [[fanboys|fanbois]] and [[noobs|n00bs]] have [[emo|bitched]] about the lack of maps and even [[threatening suicide|threatened to commit account suicide]] if nothing was done about this. 

To solve this, the [[God|Lead Game Designer]] and his [[Konami|dev team]] are currently putting their [[skillz|mad skillz]] to good [[work]] on the official War Expansion Pack, which will include new maps, improved [[guns]], custom soundtrack, more [[ogrish|gore]] and better [[graphics|graphix]]. The expansion pack will be available as a [[free|free download]] on [[apocalypse|December 21, 2012]].

==Rules For War==

* One side shall set up the terrain, and the other choose which side to start on. 
* There are 3 rounds in all wars- The shooting round, the movement round, and the "Deciding who buys Doritos, pizza, and mountain dew" round.
* Use [http://www.monstersofcock.com cannon]s to knock over the opponent's soldiers, thus deciding who lives and who dies.
* One foot per turn for infantry and three per turn for cavalry.
* [[France]] is only a puppet for bigger countries
* [[Russia]] can only win, if there is enough money from other countries

If a body of troops is within six inches of a troop of its own [[man|men]], at least half the size of the advance force, it is said to be supported. If not, it is isolated. In a [[Melee|melee]], if both forces are even, all are destroyed - remove them from the [[battlefield]]. If one side has more than the other, check to see if the inferior force is supported. If so, remove the entire inferior force, and an equal number of the larger force. If the inferior force is isolated, however, remove an equal number of soldiers of both sides until the larger force is twice as large as the inferior force. (Note that this may mean removing no soldiers at all!) At that point, all of the remaining men of the inferior force are captured. Captured units may be escorted to your [[rear]] - if you get them off your edge of the board, they're out of the game. One soldier can escort up to seven prisoners. If the [[Muslim|enemy]] kills an [[whore|escort]], the [[prison]]ers may return to their own side, but must return to the back board edge before being able to fight again.

==The Name of A War==

The most important aspect of a War is the name. A war without a suitably grand name becomes insignificant - for example, [[noone]] remembers the War of Jenkin's Ear.

Suitable names include The Great War (World War One would have been too pessimistic) and World War II (this time it's personal). Unfortunately sometimes leaders come up with the name of a war before they have found someone to play against (e.g. [[George W Bush|War On Terror]], [[War on Drugs]]), this causes confusion and creates a situation in which the country goes to war against someone determined by the results of a game of Risk (or Twister if the mission cards can’t be found).

The coolest thing about winning a war is that you then get to decide what it's called. Winning is best achieved by either having the [[gay|sexiest uniforms]] or the hardest [[special forces]].

==Trench Warfare==
:''Not to be confused with [[Lose|French Warfare]].''
'''Trench Warfare''' is the most modern form of warfare, dating back to [[World War I]], it involves a great deal of aspects from civilian lifestyle in western cultures. Notably, you sit on a [[dick]] all day doing nothing until a shell falls and you die. Various military forces work to prevent Trench Warfare from occuring, such as having a military force so laughable no warfare will actually occur, as the [[Canada|country]] will simply be annexed. Another way to avoid Trench Warefare is to maintain [[UK|superior artillery firepower]], thus easily grinding the budding [[Argentina|opponent]]. Finally, as a failsafe, a participant in a war could always surrender and hand himself in to the enemy, because fighting seemed like a [[Austria|bad idea at the time]].
