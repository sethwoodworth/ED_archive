Tyler Clementi
{{An hero}}
[[File:Tyler_clementi.jpg|thumb]]
'''Tyler Clementi''' was a [[Fag|gay]] [[ginger]] college student who attended Rutgers University. [[Last Thursday]], after his [[Azn]] and Arab roommates secretly filmed him [[Buttsecks|taking it up the ass]], Tyler made the brilliant decision of [[An hero|killing himself]]. While this appears to be your [[typical]] uninteresting teen [[An Hero|suicide]], the fact that sex, and [[Terrorists|Arabs]] were involved caused an [[Old Media]] shitstorm.

Tyler Clementi was also a happy participant at cam4.com, jerking off with glee before thousands of online strangers.  Of course, once the mediawhores wanted to assrape the country by making [[an hero]] of knobgobbler Tyler Clementi, this inconvenient fact was dropped down the memory hole.

When he has asked to use the dorm alone for a night, Arab, his [[Gay | curious]] roommate, secretly turned on a hidden webcam from a friend's dorm room hoping to see some cunt he won't have to pay for. Instead of girl booty, Ravi and his [[azn]] girlfriend caught a case of gay and decided to spread it around on [[Twitter]], sharing the video feed with everyone on the internet. 

== Spread ==
Ravi quickly decided to show everyone on the interbutts the [[Rape|stiff rogering]] that happened in his dorm. At first, no one gave a shit; it was just another video of some fags having sex, and few fapped to it. Once the backstory got out, though, the shitstorm began. 

== Literal Butthurt ==
On the night of the 22nd, Tyler once again asked Ravi for a night alone in the dorm. Ravi once again decided to record the whole thing on his webcam, presumably fiddling with his mustache and laughing as he did. This time, however, Tyler figured it out. 

==[[An Hero]]==
Deciding that he had [[Bawww|nothing to live for]] because some [[Basement Dweller|basement dwellers]] saw a grainy video of him taking it in the [[ass]], Tyler immediately decided to jump off the George Washington bridge. At first [[noone]] cared; it was just another angsty teenager offing himself. However, when the news got out that a Arab showed everyone the faggot's [[cock]], all hell broke loose.

==[[White Knight]] Time==

As soon as word got out that a scrawny fag killed himself, and because of a dirty Arab, no less, the story got [[Faux News|national coverage]]. Hearts everywhere warmed for the selfish, insecure homo attention whore. The old media even mentioned recent [[Faggotry|homosexuality]]-related teen suicides that no one cared about because there were no Arabs involved. Ravioli and the [[Azn]] have been expelled are now [[LOLWUT|charged with invasion of privacy, and could get up to five years in jail each]].

Naturally, the folks at NMA created a reenactment of the events.
