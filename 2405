This is a poem about my house monster OC Growler, it is partially inspired by the song She Wolf by Shakira as well as a quote of Jim Carrey's.

I'm in disguise.<br/>
SOS.<br/>
I'm in disguise.<br/>
And i'm coming out.<br/>

A sophisticated guy is all that you ask of me.<br/>
But it's no joke, at night I get rather grinchy.<br/>
As the moon comes up, my eyes start glowing.<br/>
I get all wild, green fur starts growing.<br/>

Yes i'm a weregrinch it's true, indeed I am.<br/>
I'm not like normal people, it's true that i am not.<br/>
Better beware or i might get you.<br/>
Because i'm always out on the prowl.<br/>

Yes I am that weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Open up and set me free.<br/>
I am that weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Let me out so i can breathe.<br/>
Please let me out.<br/>

I like to scare humans out of their wits.<br/>
My stealth and cunning catches them by surprise.<br/>
To me there is nothing more fun than scaring humans.<br/>
I'm always prowling around at night.<br/>

I transform at full moon.<br/>
Sometimes around the christmas season.<br/>
Even before or after it as well.<br/>
Because it's a grinch thing.<br/>

I lurk in the closet.<br/>
I'm sort of a closet monster.<br/>
I scare humans for fun.<br/>
I enjoy every minute of it.<br/>

You know I also like being the thing under children's beds.<br/>
I want children to run into their parent's rooms in the middle of the night.<br/>
Screaming..."Aaah! Mum! Dad! Jim Carrey's under my bed. Can I sleep with you?"<br/>
I like to frighten humans, because it's a lot of fun.<br/>

I'm in disguise.<br/>
SOS<br/>
I'm in disguise.<br/>
I'm a weregrinch in disguise.<br/>
And i'm coming out.<br/>

I'm that weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Open up and set me free.<br/>
I'm that weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Let me out so i can breathe.<br/>
Please let me out.<br/>

Prowling around at night.<br/>
Scaring humans silly.<br/>
That is my favourite thing to do.<br/>
I can be frightening.<br/>

You better beware if you see me.<br/>
Because if i bite you or scratch you.<br/>
You might find yourself becoming a weregrinch too.<br/>
I'm coming for you.<br/>

This holiday season, you better watch out.<br/>
Because i'm coming to steal Christmas and your heart.<br/>
I'm on the prowl again.<br/>
Better look out.<br/>

I'm that weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Open up and set me free.<br/>
I'm that weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Let me out so i can breathe.<br/>
Just let me out.<br/>

I lurk in the closet.<br/>
I'm prowling around.<br/>
Looking for humans to scare.<br/>
It's sort of my thing.<br/>

I'm a carnivore.<br/>
But if my grinch-like urges get the best of me.<br/>
You'll find me out eating out of a garbage can.<br/>
I can't control it really, it is a grinch thing.<br/>

I got this way after Jim Carrey bit me.<br/>
I'm a weregrinch that lurks in the closet.<br/>
I love to scare humans, it's ever so funny when they run away and scream.<br/>
Some say that it is not easy being green but i disagree, it is easy being green.<br/>

I'm the weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Open up and set me free.<br/>
I'm the weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Let me out so i can breathe.<br/>
Please let me out.<br/>

I'm in disguise.<br/>
Yes Oh Yes.<br/>
I'm a weregrinch in disguise.<br/>
And tonight i'm coming out.<br/>

Let me out, let me out.<br/>
Please let me out.<br/>
If you don't, i'll get you.<br/>
Let me out.<br/>

Yes oh yes i'm in disguise.<br/>
Yes i'm in disguise.<br/>
I'm a weregrinch in disguise.<br/>
And tonight i'm coming out.<br/>

I'm coming out.<br/>
Better beware.<br/>
I prowl, snarl and let out a grinchy growl.<br/>
Be afraid, be very afraid.<br/>

I'm not so prudent.<br/>
The moon's my teacher and i am her student.<br/>
Because i'm a weregrinch, as you can see.<br/>
So you better look out for me.<br/>

I'm that weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Open up and set me free.<br/>
I'm that weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Let me out so i can breathe.<br/>
So let me out right now.<br/>

You know that I don't bite<br/>
In fact i'm not so bad when you get to know me.<br/>
But tick me off and you'll be my next victim.<br/>
I'm a wild weregrinch don't you know.<br/>

I'm that weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Open up and set me free.<br/>
I'm that weregrinch in your closet.<br/>
Let me out so i can breathe.<br/>
Please let me out right now.}}
