{{an hero}}

According to [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]], a [[fag|faggy]] [[emo]] kid who became [[an hero]] and told the [[Internets]] about it on November 29, [[2005]].

==What really happened==

[[Image:Emo_suicide.jpg|thumb|The original screenshot of the attention whoring bastard.]]

'''You people make me sick... suicide isn't funny, it's hilarious'''

On that very date, the troubled, depressed and overall having-a-shitty-life emo kid decided that [[life]] has utterly [[pwned]] him in epic proportions, so he decided to [[permaban]] himself from life. The above message has drawn attention from likewise troubled, depressed and overall having-a-shitty-life emos and people who adhere to [[The Internet Is Serious Business]] principle like religious zealots. His post, written in the totally unpredictable manner of a [[16 year old girl]], advised to call the [[police]], but posting bulletins warning of your intentions isn't original because [[Rachele Rudd]] did that way back in 2004.

When the police arrived at the scene, they found him in the bathtub with a bullet hole in his head. The kid's brother apparently inherited his [[attention whore|attention whoring]], [[angst]] and emoism, as he was caught checking a dead emo's [[MySpace]] account. Isn't that a violation of the "Respect for the dead" scene? Doubtfully, because emos barely qualify as animals, much less real people.

==About: The emo's bulletin==
The [[emo]] sonofabitch sent out a bulletin to his [[friends list]] to alert them to his suicide just before he committed the deed. No one really cared, though, because it was just the usual faggy ass emo whining bullshit, and no one suspected (though they all hoped) he would [[pwn]] himself for real. The dumbass then pulled a Kurt Cobain by injecting a large dose of metal into his head. It is reported that after learning that their son had finally committed suicide his parents threw a big party and partied like it was 1999.

Many people believe that he was, in fact, [[Norwegian]], shown by his lack of capitalization and grammar, but in truth he was actually just a [[retarded]] [[emo]].

==Immediate and other consequences==

A [[YTMND]] has spawned on the [[YTMND]] site, informing many unsuspecting users who have a sense of [[humor]] while maintaining sadistic pleasure and [[sarcasm]] (unlike most of the internets) of the [[suicide]]. The rumor has spread across the Internets like [[AIDS]] in [[Africa]] and the emo's MySpace site has reached the peak of its views, pretty much like the [[olde]] artists of the [[old media]].

For a week or so, the meme had not yet transcended to [[old meme]] status, which amazed the internets for its longevity (or stupidity). Linking to the "[[EMO]] SUICIDES LAWLWOLLOLOFLR" YTMNDs was still considered funny. However, the dead emo was forgotten as soon as another attention whore committed suicide and told the internets about that. All your attention are belong to another [[emo]].

And thus, he got pwned. Again.

The [[emo]]'s MySpace site got hacked and posted a link to some [[hacker]]s' website. Needless to say, the kid got thoroughly pwned even after his death. A most excellent job indeed. Unfortunately, the screenshots of the hacked website have been lost in the wild jungles of the [[internets]].

==About the emo himself==

[[Image:Myspaceemobefore.JPG|thumb|Before the emo's death.]]

He walked by the internets handle of "you BROKE my LIFE" (capitalization preserved), loved "girls who cry"; was married; was 8 feet, 11 inches tall and made $250,000 a year or more. He was a smartass. He posted [[camwhore|self-portraits]] that featured him at his emo-kid best: shaggy hair, pouting lips, [[acne]] scars, intentionally blank expression. He posted an ad for a clothing company called Emo Police that featured a man hanging from the P. His last words were reported to be 
[[emo|"I made my mistakes, got nowhere to run, the night goes on as I'm fading away, I'm sick of this life, I just want to scream,  'How could this happen to me?'"]]

Joshua Ballard (his real name) was also a member of secret [[United States]] intelligence agency [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.A.F.E. S.A.F.E] when he was alive.
