Pluto
== IS PLUTO A PLANET? ==

==Pluto==

'''Pluto''' is an tiny landmass which is [[over 9000]] million miles from Earth. It was once a planet, but much [[lulz]] ensued when the scientists at [[Homosexual|NASA]] decided it would be a good idea to demote it to the status of "planetoid" ([[wigger|wanna-be planet]]). Of course, [[at least 100]] science textbooks had to be rewritten and [[lulz|every person who had just written an essay about Pluto failed]]. In short scientist trolled a bunch of fags, lulz were had.

==Pluto's future==

[[Some_argue|It is believed]] that Pluto went [[an hero]] when news broke out that everyone hated it and no longer considered it to be a planet. It now resides in its [[basement dweller|mother's basement]] (space) where it writes [[emo|shitty poems]], trolled around the Something Awful forums and gets picked on by freshmen planets such as Ceres.

After getting banned for [[Goatse]] spam, Pluto then headed over to the [[Facepunch Studios]] forums where he got banned by Hezzy for replying to a ban-me thread and was then [[I see what you did there|mooned]] by Postal.


What the scientists at NASA don't know is that in a million or so years, Pluto will become sick of Earth's bullshit and will haul its fat, icy ass over to earth and collide with it, blowing the fucker up; Mars will subsequently [[LOL]] [[IRL]] (that is, if the sun doesn't kill us all by blowing up in our faces first).

==Conspiracy Theory==

The [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|truth is]], Pluto may actually still be a planet. NASA became close to developing a system to allow [[faggots|people]] to [[ignored|live on Pluto]]. Of course the [[USA|U.S.A]] [[butthurt|didn't want the evil Russian's knowing this]], so they claimed Pluto as a planet was dead.

==Youtube==

As always [[YouTube]] serves as a medium for much lulz, people bitching one way and another.
Just everyday Youtube stuff!

This is quite possibly the best description of the crap being posted over at [[YouTube]].
