Citation needed
[[Image:Webcomic xkcd - Wikipedian protester.png|center|thumb|500px|Wikipedia attaining World Domination; one citation at a time.]]

Widely known <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">&#91;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources|''citation&nbsp;needed'']]&#93;</sup> as [[Wikipedia]]'s way of saying "I don't [[habeeb it]], prove it", '''Citation Needed''' is easily noticed <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">&#91;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources|''citation&nbsp;needed'']]&#93;</sup> by usage of this tag: <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">&#91;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources|''citation&nbsp;needed'']]&#93;</sup>, and generally indicates that users on Wikipedia mean [[serious business]]. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">&#91;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources|''citation&nbsp;needed'']]&#93;</sup>

==Variations==
[[Image:Verification_needed.png|thumb|right|Wikipedia's effective moderation strategy.]]
Wikipedia has multiple methods of stating that citation is necessary, including: <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs verification." class="noprint">&#91;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Verifiability|''verification&nbsp;needed'']]&#93;</sup>, <sup title="The text preceeding this tag needs specification." class="noprint">&#91;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Specificity|''specify'']]&#93;</sup>, <sup title="quit it!" class="noprint">&#91;93;</sup> and <span title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint" style="font-size:smaller;">&#91;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources#When you quote someone|CITE?]]&#93;</span>. Although different in appearance, they essentially mean the same thing: an assertion needs to be backed up with sources that meet Wikipedia's so-called policies.{{citation}}<br/>Usage of the tags can sometimes lead to an [[edit war]] between the Wikipedophile who originally added the information to the [[article]], and the [[bureaucratic fuck]] who doesn't believe him. The resulting reverts and "discussion" on the article's talk page can sometimes be the source of good quality [[lulz]].{{citation}}

==Usage==
[[Image:Citation_needed_irl.jpg|thumb|right|Citation Needed IRL.]]
Citation Needed is to be used anytime a statement or piece of information (no matter how true, logical or plain common sense it may be) is not verified with a source linking from the article, no matter how doubtful the source is.{{citation}} Additionally, use of the "verification needed" tag can take place when a source other than [[The Guardian]] is cited,{{citation}} or when information might be considered [[original research]], which is against [[TOW]] [[Wikipedia_Policies_and_Guidelines|policies]].

===Examples===
*The sky is blue.{{citation}}
*The opposite of black is white.{{citation}}
*Wikipedia is serious fucking business.<sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">&#91;[[Dong|''no&nbsp;citation&nbsp;needed&nbsp;(we&nbsp;all&nbsp;know&nbsp;wikipedia&nbsp;is&nbsp;serious&nbsp;business.)'']]&#93;</sup>

==Insults==
When a [[bureaucratic fuck]] uses enough "citation" needed tags, he or she will inevitably add the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Refimprove "Needs Additional References"] template to the top of the article.{{citation}} Adding this tag basically establishes the article as a likely [[lie]] from the start{{citation}} and confirms to the rest of the Wikipedophiles that, if they hadn't guessed by now, the person who added the tag really does mean [[serious business]].{{citation}}
