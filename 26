[[Image:Soccer is for faggots.jpg|thumb|If a Eurofag [[RAGE]]S on the internet, does it make a sound?]]

[[The best]] board on all of the *[[chans]], and certainly the most easy to [[troll]], '''/sp/''' is 4chan's obligatory [[sports]] board. It's a place where [[fat|overweight]] armchair quarterbacks (who call themseves '''/sp/artans''' but everyone else calls '''/sp/astics''') go to [[trolls trolling trolls|troll back at the trolls trolling them]], and discuss sports every now and then. Your average /sp/fag gets [[Asperger's|offended by anything]], as long as it contradicts their favorite team or sport. For example, Eurofags get butthurt whenever the word "Soccer" is uttered and Amerifags can't stand it when their supposedly manly game is put down with words like "padball" and "handegg." Needless to say, the opportunity to fuck with stupid faggots is endless.

==[[18-1]]==

[[Image:Bradydown.jpg|thumb|left|Always funny... Brady rolls on floor laughing.]]

[[Image:Oh, 18-1!.png|thumb|...always.]]

/sp/'s greatest meme and source of win comes, [[ironic|ironically]],  from one of the greatest sports failures of all time, the 2007 New England Patriots, in which the pissah BAWWston team won 18 consecutive games and then subsequently lost the Super Bowl.  Whatever the subject, "18-1" is always the proper response to any [[Boston]]fag saying anything ever, or to anyone else who appears easy to troll, which, again, is pretty much everyone.

==[[Rax Grissman]]==

[[Image:UNLEASH THE DRAGON.jpg|thumb|left|YOU GOTTA UNLEASH THE DRAGON!!]]

[[Image:Rax-grissman.png|thumb|[[Rax Grissman]]]]

In the 4th quarter of Super Bowl XLI  quarterback Rex Grossman of the Chicago Bears made one of the stupidest, ill advised plays [[evar]].  Instead of making a sure-thing, check-down pass for a first down, he said, "Fuck it, I'm goin' DEEEEEEEP,"  and threw >9,000 yards down the field only to have it [[fail|picked off]], ensuring the Bears defeat. After he [[FYIAD|UNLEASHED THE DRAGON]], Rex came to symbolize everything fail in sports (this was before 18-1), and thereby was destined to became a favorite of /sp/. When a cancerous newfag accidentally posted the much-win Rax Grissman in a [[Nod Flenders]] thread, the board finally had a fitting depiction of Sexy Rexy, as, like Rax, Grossman is a fucking joke.

==/cle/==

[[Image:OHIO_SUCKS.jpg|thumb|/cle/ sucks]]

/cle/ is the delusional Cleveland faction of /sp/ ([[Shit nobody cares about|though this is sometimes extended to Columbus as well]]), which consists of underage b&s sucking LeCrab James's dick. /cle/ is notorious for having shitty sports teams, especially the Cleveland [[Shit|Browns]] of [[handegg]] and Cleveland [[racism|Indians]] of steroidball. When not jacking off to pictures of Brady Quinn or browsing [http://www.cavfanatic.com Cavfanatic], /cle/fags will post about how Kobe Bryant is inferior to LeBron (who, [[last Thursday]], was dunked on by a college basketball player), and how Cliff Lee is [[lie|a legitimate pitcher who didn't just have a fluke season in 2008]].

==/vc/==

[[Image:Veecee.jpg|thumb|/vc/]]

Like Rax and 18-1, most of /sp/'s memes come from epic fail in the world of sports. So it is no wonder that Vince Carter is one of /sp/'s oldest and most enduring memes. Unlike Grossman, /vc/'s fail was a more gradual process, as his promising early career turned out to be nothing more than hype and choking in the playoffs. Despite his crappiness, Carter is still good for 13 points worth of dunks every night, proving again and again to be one of the most over-payed players in the history of the game. He serves as a constant reminder to everyone of the mistake in [[YHBT|thinking that a guy who's entire game is based on the slam dunk could ever really make it in the NBA]].

==THAT. BIRD.==

[[image:thatbird.jpg|thumb|left|]]

THAT. BIRD. is the result of the 2008-2009 NFL season when the Arizona Cardinals (now known as THAT. BIRD.) went on to defy the odds by going against [[The Best]] division in football and stumbling into the playoffs with a 9-7 record. They were signed off as a mere mistake, but then ended up lolling their way all the way up to the Super Bowl. The trail of drama and [[lulz]] from the teams they left behind are a story of NFL legend. Of course, being the typical massive joke and pile of [[fail]] team that they are, THAT. BIRD. Lost [[the game]] in the last 40 seconds of the Superbowl to the Pittsburgh Steelers, <s>who went back home to the [[Pittsburgh|City of Champions]] while leaving THAT. BIRD in extreme [[butthurt]]</s>. Shitsburgh is filled with [[Faggotry|faggotry]]. "Big" Ben rapes women and is a retard. Also, a racehorse that won the 2009 Kentucky Derby.

==/hoc/==

[[image:Crosbyrage.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cindy Crosby|It's only fitting.]]]]

/hoc/ is the Hockey faction on /sp/. Most /hoc/ fags are fans of teams in the Atlantic Division (usually the [[Philadelphia]] [[Shit nobody cares about|Flyers]]), [[Canadia|Canadafags]], and fans of the Red Wings.

/sp/ hates Crosby so much, that whenever he is brought up, /sp/artans frequently post pictures of Crosby getting knocked down on his bitch ass, along with the caption "Its only fitting."

Other shitstorms in /hoc/ include: [[faggotry]] about the Flyers, Rangers, Red Wings, or any Canadian team, or how teams in Southern markets such as the Atlanta Thrashers or the Nashville Predators should move to Canada.  If anyone mentions the Boston Bruins in a /hoc/ thread, the common response to said faggotry is [[18-1]].  As previously mentioned. [[butthurt]] rants about Cindy Crosby are the most common topic in /hoc/. Also, hate against Jew is common.

/hoc/ doesn't exist outside of hockey season, until /sp/ discovered YAVA HOCKEY.

==USA WON FIFA|FUCK ENGLAND==

[[Image:Donovan stlyin on you.jpg|thumb|right|[[America]]s response to the Spanish [[butthurt]]]]

The only Soccer discussion /sp/ usually has is the Soccer vs Football troll threads where [[Americans]] pretend to be [[Europeans]] and Europeans pretend to be Americans. They spew the same [[copypasta]] over and over again and nothing is ever really discussed. In June 2009 however during the Confederation Cup held in South Africa the American Soccer team decided to show up and they defeated Italy 3-0 while Brazil beat Egypt 3-0 in the final games of that group. Because of those bizarre outcomes and the tie breaking formula USA advanced to the next round in the tournament. Suddenly /sp/ was interested in Soccer and the upcoming game vs Spain, it was hyped up and called Megabowl II. Many people knew USA didn't stand much of a chance but patriotism and the possible [[trolling]] that could ensue led to about half of /sp/ picking USA over Spain. Game time came and the vuvuzelas were in full BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. USA scored two goals and TIM MOTHERFUCKING HOWARD had more saves than Trevor Hoffman and Mariano Rivera combined. USA won 2-0 and /sp/ exploded in ">spain" and "How does my ass taste Spain?". The Spanish [[butthurt]] was immense, America beat Spain at their national sport, the same sport America would otherwise not give a shit about. The Megabowl II gave /sp/ much needed [[lulz]] seeing as how the summer sucks for sports.

USA WON FIFA was born from a 2008 match where the [[USA|USA]] [[victory|tied]] the then-number one ranked team in the world, [[Mexico|Argentina]].

==[[Fat Man|Fat Man Saga]]==

[[Image:O civil war.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The Man Who Almost Broke /sp/]]

One day the /sp/artans at 4chan discovered a website entirely devoted to discussing why sports are responsible for everything that is wrong in society; www.sportssuck.org. They proceeded to infiltrate their forums and troll for great justice. One member in Particular really rubbed the /sp/artans the wrong way, that man was FAT MAN at first the trolls thought he might be the greatest troll of all time but they quickly realized he was not. They proceeded to get doc's, and much win and lulz  were had. 

Though the majority of /sp/artans found trolling sportssucks to be full of lulz, some began to feel the focused personal attacks on Fat Man were going too far. Some were disgusted by the amount of Fat Man threads and left, while others stuck around to complain  and sage (saging on /sp/, lol). Though Fat Man raid threads were already responsible for a large amount of /sp/'s content, cries of "GTFO /b/TARDS YOU'RE RUINING /sp/" continued to flood the board, effectively derailing /sp/, making it almost impossible to discuss anything but Fat Man.

The board was split on whether or not these so called "/b/ tactics" were appropriate when dealing with a sad old man. Moralfags claimed that he didn't deserve this treatment just because he dislikes sports, while the trolls argued that anyone so easily trolled must be further pursued. You have to admit, this is pretty fucking funny. Issues about his overt racism, ignorance and intolerance were also brought up as reasons for the raid, suggesting that he wasn't such an innocent old man after all.

It originally appeared that the Super Bowl rid /sp/ of Fat Man forever, but it proved to be only a momentary distraction, and the trolling continues.

==Post Fat Man/Super Bowl, During the Olympics==

Presently /sp/ is without a decent mod so cross board raids and other shenanigans have upset the balance of power on 4chan. Some want to just get rid of /sp/ cause they're obviously butt hurt from the cross board raids. While others just wish moot would give /sp/ a mod they deserve. 

It was said by moot that /sp/ was the mods least favorite board and thus creating mass hysteria on the board with people believing that /sp/ would be banned for good.  While one side of the people of /sp/ were taking this as a joke, the other side had already made up their minds, with their new allies /mu/ they had a back up board if /sp/ was to be shut down.
