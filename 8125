<b>TheRedSkull</b>, AKA Jamie Demeter, is a [[Hipster|psycho]][[Douche|path]]ic [[internet tough guy]] , [[Greg Solomon]] fanboy, '''[[ED]] vandal''', self-hating [[gay|homophobic]] [[nerd]], and a [[megalomania]]cal [[manchild]] with delusions of grandeur. It is assumed TheRedSkull became somewhat e-famous after losing an heroic [[internets]] battle with the [[YouTube]]lebrity [[Renetto]]. However in reality, [[some argue|many argue]] he is notable for his ability to be easily [[pwn]]ed. 

Owing over $1,000 to [[Renetto]], TheRedSkull is currently "on the run"&mdash;from both [[Renetto]] and the [[Americunt]] government for war crimes against the [[Internets]]. He is somewhat [[notable]] for crying over split milk, reading [[Scientology|L RON HUBBARD]], and getting [[butthurt]] over absolutely nothing.

More recently, TheRedSkull has been waging a passive aggressive blitz campaign against the honorable [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] and some phailed troll [[Tom Serson]], as shown here [http://www.livevideo.com/video/Redskull/C1700D9B735C414A9CE5D59ECFD6F1DA/encyclopedia-dramatica-miscon.aspx]. ''Moar drama is pending'', and basically no one cares but "[[YOU]]". It's important to note; in conclusion, Red Skull believes the [[internet]] is his [[personal army]], not understanding that he is merely a sociopath of little concern.

==[[ED]]iot Research==
[[Image:Brackus.jpg|thumb|right|sorry President who ?]]
A great deal of personal information can be found when searching the [[internet]]s for TheRedSkull. Whether it's tracking his [[IP]] or contacting the magical "Steve Pheby", it's clear that someone needs to "be very careful what you put on the [[internet]]". It is advised that if one were to choose to approach Mr. RedSkull, that they should [[troll]] with care. TheRedSkull gets easily upset over spilt [[dongs|milk]], and [[Ebaumsworld|blames everything on 4chan]].

TheRedSkull is known to make various [[sock]] accounts. He even went as far as to sign up on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] (several times), with the wacky idea he could somehow erase this article. That idea is '''obviously pointless''', and a [[ED:VIP|waste of time]].

Currently, [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]]iot researchers are working over time to generate their "endgame" report regarding this epic [[drama]] saga.

==Previous Faggotry of TheRedSkull==

[[Image:Jamie_makes_a_Batman_suit.JPG|left]]
{{clear}}

Before YouTube, TheRedSkull was regularly pwned and laughed at on the [http://www.gothampublicworks.com/forums Gotham Public Works forums] --where he failed to make any friends, but entertained us by being the most pathetic person we had ever had the misfortune to see sign up on the boards.

When he was not threatening suicide,  he was asking for people's addresses so that he could beat them up in real life after they had owned him. He would also talk about how he enjoyed masturbating while wearing his granny's panties, as well as putting dildos up his ass.  Finally, he would also talk, quite frequently, about the videos he made of himself playing with his dog's balls.

===TheRedSkull [[disregard that, I suck cocks|Responds]]===
''While checking out my article I noticed someone from GPW posted stuff about me. Let me explain. Yes I was on that site however when I was banned, I came back under proxies. The moderator of the site saw fit to edit every one of my posts to detract me from visiting. Go ask him your self at www.gothampublicworks.com under the named GPW Batman. If he is truthful he will tell you what he did. But then I guess thats what ED and its users are all about right? Incorrect info'' {{unsigned|theredskull}}

==TheRedSkull Proves His Computer Illiteracy!==
[[Image:Jamie's_proof_that_ED_has_viruses.JPG|thumb|While his screen is displaying every character possible, Detective Jamie tracks down the "æ", thereby proving that ED [[BRILLIANT!|hacked his computer]].]]

In a TL;DW video on the LiveVideo site, TheRedSkull shows how he understands neither the Internets nor computers, as he blames ED for for "sending him a virus" from the site. He attempts to "prove" this by booting up the infected computer and dragging the now near comatose viewer around the screen filled with blocks and characters to point out the "æ logo". What he fails to realize, and thus point out, is that the majority of the characters on the screen are generated by the ALT key in conjunction with a numeric sequence from the numeric pad (that of the "logo" being Alt+145). In short, it proves nothing since, by RedSkull's dubious "logic" the musical note symbol could have been placed there by any number of online music sites that gave him "teh haxxorz virus! Oh noes!". Not only is his claim preposterous, but he then continues to bring the [[lulz]] by imploring people OVER AND OVER to "not go to ED", "Do NOT try to talk to these people" for the rest of the pedantic video, which only serves to highlight his level of [[butthurt]]. naturally, he conveniently leaves out the fact that he could just remove the drive and take it to any tech shack and have it reformatted and get the fuck over himself.

==Digger "and" apology?==
"so I owe Digger and apology? Remember now ED came after me first, tma came after me first, zeno you and all the others including Digger, came after me first, so no. I don't owe any of you an apology, its the other way around. You people actually OWE me my account back. I firmly believe all my attacks have been just. You guys have just been so wrong with me, trying to figure out what accounts belong to me and what others don't, its so sad and pathetic, and you have never owned up to how wrong you have been with me. Remember you FIRMLY believed I was theonetheycallgod and you threatened to do a full disclosure on me? I was completely innocent in that case and even totcg wasn't even doing anything that bad. He was light heartily trolling Digger. Digger is just a complete psychopath, as evident with his response to me. But I have been very right with you. But just be honest, own up to it. email me at redskull@hushmail.com and tell the truth. Big crystal balls? uh Roo? Well I don't recall speaking about that person. You say its only the internet, its a little different when you call me at 4 in the morning or I see all my work gone because of you people. [[battim|I am right, and you are wrong]]."

Jamie Demeter is a man of many [[lulz|talents]]. After a long hard day of playing [[Quake]] and/or getting trolled, he likes to relax by drawing some of the bizarre things that he thinks about in daily life.  Jamie has honed his talents over the years now, and has amassed quite an impressive portfolio of sketchs and [[shoop]]s. Here's a sampling of some of the [[gay|fine]] works he has on display on his website.

Out of all of Jamie's exquisite masterpieces, nothing even comes close to the self-portrait collage he did of himself to commemorate his glorious rise to power as the webmaster of his own fucking [[Mortal Kombat]] website. Nothing epitomizes his [[unwarranted self importance]] quite like this, the [[Holy Grail]] of all RedSkull memorabilia. Behold, "The Webmaster":

And now, thanks to the magic of the ReoCities project, you can visit [http://reocities.com/SiliconValley/station/3513/ Jamie's old Mortal Kombat website] just as it appeared in 1998-2008. Although many of the images have not yet been restored, most of them can be found in the [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://come.to/mklegends Internet Archive].

==A Real Canadian Hero==

[[Image:Gungho2.jpg|thumb|Don't ask, don't tell]]
[[Image:Decimator.jpg|thumb|Ages 5 & up]]
Recently TheRedSkull has crawled out of the shadows and resurfaced once again on YouTube. This time with another master plan of getting revenge on the "stalkers and haters", and trying to reclaim what [[zero|little dignity he once had]]. As usual, his plans are beginning to blow up in his face, [[lol|again]]. Although he intended to  illustrate to people what a poor, innocent victim of circumstance he is, instead he's unintentionally revealing to them what a complete and utter faggot he truly is. As e-detectives begin digging on Jamie again, what they've found can only be described as [[LOL]]. You see, when Jamie isn't busy making shitty drawings, sewing red panty hose into super-hero masks, or blogging about his pixilated philosophies, what he likes to do instead with his spare time is <b>collect dollies</b>.
<br><br>
[[Image:REDSKULL_CANT_WAIT_FOR_GIJOECON_GUIZE.JPG|900px]]
<br><br>
Right now Jamie is actively on the hunt for some very special dollies. He's put the word out on the internet street that he's gunning for "Decimator", and "Gung Ho". His quest: to acquire the gayest G.I. Joe figures ever made.
<br><br>

==TheRedSkull: Definitely [[Not Gay]]==
[[Image:Jamies_Patrick_Swayze_Tribute_lol.JPG|thumb|Q: What 26 year old guy makes a tribute video to Patrick fucking Swayze?<br>A: A gay one.]]
Up until now, TheRedSkull's sexuality has been questionable at best. Sure he likes to wear red pantyhose on his head, make Batman suits out of spandex and rubber, play with muscular dollies, and draw bi-curious robots, but does that make him gay? No. What makes him gay is this: not one, not five, not nine, but [[ALL CAPS|TWENTY]] motherfucking tribute videos to musclebound mighty men of valor on his {{youtube2|DemeterPictures|DemeterPictures}} channel, complete with several blatant shots of full-screen man-ass. Have a look:

==Don't Trust Them Demons!==
Despite being well-known for a lengthy [[shitstain]] of [[self-pwn|self-ownage]] and [[ruin]] on the internet, something a lot of people ''don't'' know is that Jamie has more than just a passive belief in the [[occult]], Demonology, and [[cult]] rituals as well.  This includes an extreme [[paranoia]] of [[demon]]s, a belief that [[what|interdimensional demons]] can be summoned at will, and beliefs concerning rituals and [[FYIAD|possession]].  Now Jamie has always had a distinct penchant for [[faggotry|theatrics]], having made great effort over the years to portray himself in the midst of a supposed non-existent battle of "Good vs. Evil" (his actual words) with [[ED]] and his "[[haters]]" (not one to shy from invoking [[Godwin]] either).  The following is an email Jamie mistakenly sent to an editor during correspondence, it depicts his pronounced detachment from reality, and just how [[batshit|crazy in the head]] this man really is...
