'''HACKERS ON STEROIDS''' is another winning [[meme]] from the lollercaust that was a [[Faux News]] story in the summer of [[2007]] in which they attempted an [[OMG|exposé]] of [[Anonymous]].

On the fateful day of July 26th (which also happens to be [[Tay Zonday|ZonDay]]) the LA Fox News affiliate released perhaps the most lulzy piece of journalism they ever shat out of their arseholes. After Fox got [[raped]] by [[Anonymous]], they did their usual over-the-top propagandist reports describing [[Anonymous]] as domestic terrorist hackers on steroids using UNDERGROUND HACKER SECRET WEBSITES (lol, public). 


==How It Went Down==

[[Image:Hacker_Steroids.gif|thumb|OMG [[Fox News|FAUX]] WAS RITE!]]

''For '''fair and balance''' see [[Internet Vigilante Group]] on the flip-side of [[Anonymous]].''
[http://www.myfoxla.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail;jsessionid=04508F560FA08425A862ACCC963FF8EC?contentId=3894628&version=7&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=VSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 The news report] included unearthing the fact that there were pages of [[MySpace]] users dumb enough to get their accounts [[phish|phished]], [[nigras]], some [[Alex_Wuori|emo kid with a love for gay secks pictures]], and Anonymous's contempt for [[Habbo Hotel]].
 
Fox's [[old media]] shill also held up an entire [[rape|ream]] of blank paper that a staff intern had recently bought at a local Kinko's, stating that they found "THOUSANDS OF OF STOLEN PASSWORDS" on teh UNDERGROUND H4XX0R TERROR websites. [[Hacker|Hacking]] is to FOX as [[terrorism]] is to [[W]]. It featured a reporter attempting to explain "lulz" (resulting in [[epic fail]]) and later using the phrase "epic lulz".

There were also multiple live "demonstrations" involving dramatic, repeated playback of a yellow van exploding, [[Jake Brahm|threats to blow up football stadiums]], and attempts at spoiling the ending of the latest Harry Potter book. [[Serious Business|The internets is now (officially) a Die Hard re-enactment]]. (Is this awesome? y/y). [[At least 100]]% of [[fat]] housewives who watched the report immediately flipped out and canceled their [[AOL]] subscriptions. [[Win|Hooray]].

Just moments after this news report aired on Fox, something quite peculiar happened to [[B/|/b/]]; users were unable to create new threads, or post images. It's said that FOX called the [[FBI|Feds]] on /b/ to have them rape [[4chan]]'s servers. However, with the ability to post again after a day or so, many lulzy memes sprung forward, including [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE]], [[Buy A Dog]], [[Exploding Van]] and '[[Lulz]] is a corruption of [[LOL]]'. It was also revealed that the [[Anti-lulz|lulz traitor]] in the video is none other than Reverend Jim Bob, a Bob Dobbs cocklover and Subgenii piece of shit found here <s>http://www.c-h-u-r-c-h-o-f-b-o-b.com/foxnews.html.</s>  

More likely for the Fox informant is [[Alex Wuori]].

==The Raid==
[[Image:Van_explode.gif|thumb|Anon was only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.]]
In retaliation to the video, Anon decided to flood [http://community.myfoxla.com/boards/default.aspx MyFoxLA] and [http://community.myfoxdc.com/boards/default.aspx MyFoxDC]'s Message Boards, causing their admins to shit a collective amount of bricks. Quickly, the admins on both sites [[Delete Fucking Everything|deleted fucking everything]], ensuring Anon's victory. It's said that this attack on the forum might provoke a follow-up report on Anon, [[Your resistance only makes my penis harder!|which will only serve to make Anon's e-peen harder.]]

[[eBaum]]'s masquerading as [[Anonymous]] also discovered that the administrator section of FoxNews.com was left wide open because the [[retard]] who worked the site didn't know how to use '''CHMOD''' or even '''.htaccess'''. The admin directory of FoxNews contained a [[UNIX]] script for an FTP account to ZiffDavis.com, where Fox downloaded their stories. [[Anonymous]] logged onto the FTP and downloaded 1.5 million people's personal information and left their mark claiming affiliation with [[EbaumsWorld]]. This is most likely true because [[EbaumsWorld]] is known for causing havoc and chaos for everyone indiscriminately. It took them [[at least 100]] hours to fix the security issue.

Additionally, Anon, in a thread of epic lulz, OWNED the LA Fox News studio by ordering [[over 9000]] Pizza Hut Pizzones via their online website, along with numerous gay exotic dancers, sushi, take out Chinese food, massage therapists, and the like.

==Moar MySpace Hackers==

On November 14th, Fox News covered another story on the Hackers on Steroids (this time "Your Friendly Neighborhood Hackers" in a failed lulz attempt), both one and many, and while certainly taking a less direct approach, the video states they're calling for urgent, immediate, nation-wide attention, going as far to say that the White House needs to get involved.

=="Cyber Bullying"==

On January 31st, 2008 Fox 11 News did yet another story on [[Anonymous]], this time on Anonymous' "cyber bullying" through [[Stickam|www.stickam.com]]. Features hated enemy of the lulz [[Goronchev]].
