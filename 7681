'''Sony Vegas''' is an epic vlogging toolkit that will drag your scrawny ass to combat victory over any hookers you may [[open source|fail to pay]]. It is [[over 9000]] times equal to "[[Windows Movie Maker]]" and [http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/whatsnew/ Adobe Premiere] combined, except without all that freezing and errors. It has more features and effects than movie maker, [[I WOULD HAVE SEX WITH ALL THIS WHITE GIRLS|confusing and infuriating]] the average Windows user. The majority of [[Wapanese|people]] on [[YouTube]] who make an [[AMV]] use the free and "superior" Windows Movie Maker to [[fail|keep the bar low]].

==Comparison of Vegas and WMM==

===Why Sony Vegas is superior to Windows Movie Maker===
[[Fact|Windows Movie Maker always freezes and while it lacks everything]], it always gets the job done ten times faster than Sony Vegas. This allows you to stack your vlog shit ten times faster and shittier than anyone with respectable economic status. Windows Movie Maker is incapable of publishing vlogs in [[Web 2.0|High Definition]] before it is compressed to death by JewTube/Flash [[Mantrain|love sammich]]. Sony Vegas can do [[stoner|chroma key]] effects, add multiple video and audio tracks, and make you talk like a fag. However, [[women|people]] are too stupid to [[Mike Sandy|crack]] and use a [[Virus|Keygen]] on Vegas, so they end up stuck with WMM. [[Sarcasm| ''Thanks so much, Microsoft]]''.

==The Things You Can Do With Sony Vegas==
* Cut copy paste encode decode rotate zoom and add [[gay]] music to your videos.
* Add [[LSD|cool effects]] to your videos.
* [[mkv|Encode your video to a time inefficient file format and wait for it to render it for the whole day.]]
* Test the compatibility of the [[porn]] you made with your ex.
* Upload gifs to [[youtube]]
* Make local public access shows.
* Open an effect window and [[RAGE|see how annoying the docking feature is]].
* Convert your shitty 3gp and mp4 videos to a proper file format.
* See why you don't need adobe premiere and after effects at the same time when easier to use suite is available.
* Automate editing with scripts, thereby making your finished product even more generic and uninteresting!
* See that autopreview feature is not working because you don't have the necessary codecs installed.
* Steal songs from vidz.
* Make <s>funny</s> videos of your friends using layers and pan-crop-move-alphablending etc.
* Make flashing gifs.
* Increase contrast of a video and wait for it to re-render for about the whole time you spend with you pc in a day.
* [[AMV|Make music and combine it with stolen anime videos for better presentation of your music]].
* Squeeze vids like a pussy.
* Get a job in film industry and <s>make</s> lose money
* Use the preview function for fast browsing. (not clever at all)
* Crop out the unfunny parts of assumed to be funny videos of you and your friends.
* Assume editing videos is a hobby and it is one more reason for feeling self importance.
* Test various codecs and post reviews here and there.
* Convert videos of [[capitalist]] file types to more [[communist]] ones.
* Resize the video of your cock or zoom it.
* It makes video editing so simple and easy that even [[You|a moron]] can use it!

==Not for [[Apple|Macs]] or [[Linux]]==
Apparently, Sony Vegas is not compatible with Mac OS X, which makes [[Macfags]] bawww and whine over he fact that Sony Vegas won't work with their computers. In reality, Sony realized it would have tougher competition on that OS, but some would like to think [[Win|Sony <del>choose</del> [chose] for Vegas to be incompatible with OS X and Lunix in order to troll Macfags and Linux fanboys]]. However, [[nobody gives a shit]] since [[Macfags]] can just use [[free|iMovie]] and [[Lunix|Linuxfags]] can just use [[Open source|LiVES]] to edit their fucking videos. Or you could just use Final Cut Pro like every other fucking smart person on the planet.  Video editing on Windows is fine, however, if you're just an amateur or novice user.

==Even better than Vegas==
Sony Vegas has been used to edit <s>popular</s> shitty films such as [http://www.paranormalmovie.com/about2.html ''Paranormal Activity''], but real movie makers use [[Mac|Final Cut Studio]], Adobe After Effects, or Adobe Premier.  [[Apple]] and [[Adobe]] simply produces better software for [[Professional|IRL creative workers]]. Just like with [[Photoshop]], people prefer downloading After Effects from [[The Pirate Bay]] because they love free software.
