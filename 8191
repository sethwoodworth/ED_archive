[[VioletKitty411]] came up with the idea of creating a [http://www.livevideo.com/video/4A57FD0FFA3D4F8EACB80E7FD7143EF1/fight-fire-with-fire.aspx Drama-Free Fire Break] around The Promised Land's sapling user base. She explained how forest-fire fighters often did this by lighting a controlled fire a little way off from the main blaze so that when the the real fire arrived it was left with nothing to feed on.

Some of the The Promised Land's inhabitants may have misunderstood her (or understood her only too well), and reports were received of a global state of [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|arson attacks]] carried out by LiveVideo users against their own one-time LiveVideo [[drama whore|allies]], who had been causing so much bitterness by attacking on sight any innocent EDiots who crossed the borders into The Promised Land. 

Spurred on by [[VioletKitty411]]'s chilling propaganda broadcast, these attacks were both merciless and for the most part indiscriminate. In the worst cases, two of the men who were set ablaze were found to not even have been members of LiveVideo at all (see pictures). Unconfirmed reports that they had, in fact, been active members of [[YouTube]] instead only served to further raise tensions between the two sites.
