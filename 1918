You probably never heard of '''CyberDefender''', but you probably heard of '''MyCleanPC.com''', '''DoubleMySpeed.com''', '''MaxMySpeed.com''', and '''FinallyFast.com'''. All these websites (and [http://www.mywot.com/en/forum/3832-verycleanpc-com lots] more) are just fronts for CyberDefender. By running several cheap and poorly-scripted commercials, CyberDefender hopes that you'll be [[retard|stupid]] enough to believe everything you heard on TV. As with other [[haxxor|security providers]] that provide [[porn|free scanners,]] CyberDefender uses [[faggotry|hype]] in order to [[rape|lure]] users into [[buttsecks|buying their products.]] Their free software [[lies|"scans" your computers and then tells the user that there are ten thousand viruses and errors on their computer that must to removed now or else risk a cyber-catastrophe.]] However, in order to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|remove the viruses,]] the user must buy CyberDefender products that cost over 50 US dollars. [[sarcasm|Seems legit]].

==Paying for the service==
{{Quote|1=Said I have over 420 errors and that they would need another $389.00 to remove the visures after they remove the errors, which would be good for one year.|2=From David|3=[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/computers/mycleanpc.html]}}

==Censorship==
===SpyZooka===
In August 2009, SpyZooka called CyberDefender a [[fake]] antispyware program, but CyberDefender [http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aid=105841 forced them to apologize].

===Allen Harkleroad===
Allen Harkleroad is the [[troll|brave, little warrior]] who stood up to the [[Micro$oft|big, nasty corporation]]. Harkleroad didn't really challenge or threaten CyberDefender Corporation. All he did was publish his [[facts|skepticism and observations]] online, but CyberDefender would take none of that &ndash; after all, criticism is covered by the First Amendment. CyberDefender's attorneys sent [http://fmdconsumer.com/image.axd?picture=Letter-March242010.jpg legal threats] to Harkleroad and [[butthurt|accused him of libel and fabrication.]]
