Street cred
[[Image:Hasselhoff3.jpg|thumb|David Hasselhoff and Gary Coleman are two kings of street cred]]
[[Street cred]] is how long your [[irl]] [[e-penis]] is if you live in the [[ghetto]]. [[Nigra]]s try and use their street cred to [[Lynching|Rise up and over come]], but fail as much as a [[newfag]] dividing by zero.

It turns out that "Street Cred" is about as valuable IRL as your [[e-penis|E-penus]] is anywhere outside [[furaffinity]].

Street cred can get you fantastic pleasure or material. Such things include blowjobs, free drugs, cheaper drinks, backstage passes, trust, skin bleaching, plastic surgery, etc. etc.

There is also the ''delusion'' of Street cred among the [[wigger]] population, although everyone knows those crackers can't get cred worth [[shit]].
