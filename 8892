'''Wank''' is a British slang term for [[masturbation]].

In [[fandom]], wank is used metaphorically to refer to fans who have gotten so carried away that they are getting off on their egos in public.  It can also refer to any general fandom [[drama]].  See [[Fandom Wank]].

It is also a term used by Northeners to express an unimpressed attitude towards something. It was widely used thanks to the arrogant Sheffield bunch of tossers, known as The Arctic Monkeys; "The band were fucking [[Live8|wank]] and I'm not having a nice time."

It should be noted that one never says 'wank off'. Unless you are a [[americunt|true]] [[emo|intellectual]].
