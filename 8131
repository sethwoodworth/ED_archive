<big><center>"These websites are teaching our children how to [[rape|self-kill]]" -[[old media|SWC, Welsh News Channel]]</center></big><br>
The first two months of the year 2008 were special for the small town of [[Wales]] in the country of Bridgend. Not only did they achieve the sexual delight of having at least ten sheep for every person, but their nation's youth developed a new trend; committing [[suicide]] because someone on [[Bebo]] told them to.

At least one hot chick self-pwned and there is much trolling to be had on Bebo as a result.

== Genesis ==
[[Image:Gallows lol.jpg|thumb|right|An emergency meeting of Bridgend council led to the decision to install gallows in the town.]]

The whole fad started in December 2006, when an alleged [[B|/b/tard]] started a Bebo group known as the   BSC (Bebo Suicide Club to its members). Soon after this, a few of the members self-pwned but none of this mattered as none of the [[An Hero]]es were hot. 

After six months of operation targeting [[retarded|Mentally unstable Welsh children]] the group was shut down by the [[mods]] of the Bebo website.

However, the [[B|/b/tard]] who founded this club had planted the seeds of suicide into their minds, deeper than [[AIDS]] in an [[African]] woman's [[cunt]]. The group offshot into several cells with a total member ship of [[at least 100|around 45]] [[emo]] and [[chav]] kids.

== Down to Business ==

Then as Christmas 2007 approached ever closer, the members of the BSC decided to embark on a LIFECHANGING mission of [[suicide|self-pwnage]]. The BSC members gradually hung and OD'ed themselves into oblivion and then, it happened;


== '''A HOT CHICK KILLED HERSELF''' - The [[Old Media|Media's]] Reaction ==

[[Image:SUNNEWSPAPER.jpg]]

Semi hot chick, Natasha Randall (she can randall me any time she likes, [[amirite]]?) joined the club by hanging herself, and this moment was personified most beautifully by the following comment;

<big>"Our bABeZ Tasha went Just LIke Jesus" -x-xx-x-sarah-x-xx-x, Bebo.com member</big><br>

However, this line was not good enough for the [[Old Media]] who instead equated Bebo membership to being a member of an "internet suicide death cult (Daily Mail)". Which, considering that Bebo.com is the website used by those people who are simply too [[Goatse|GoatseTarded]] to work MySpace, is an extremely pleasant theory.

An excellent place to troll is her memorial <s>[http://natasha-randall.gonetoosoon.co.uk/]</s> Beleted.

== The Hangers On ==

With self-pwnage being the new big thing in Bridgend, with all the [[cool]] kids doing it, the retarded kids joined in the fun a month after it was fashionable.

These two were cousins, Kelly Stephenson and Nathaniel Pritchard, who with their combinations of funny names and genetic unattractive Welshness, were totally [[asking for it]].

The last comment on Nathaniel Pritchard's Bebo was from his mannish girlfriend saying;

"''you lied to me twice!

''ur mum and mel gave u money so you can buy me summing
for valantines, but you spent it on yourself''


''that really hurt me ...
id rather just forget about you, coz i cant be arsed with you either''"

'''EPIC LULZ'''


These new An Heroes were so unattractive that they had no use as fapping material, except for [[12chan]], so the [[internets]] populous discovered a new use for the pairing; trolling their recently vacated Bebo.com accounts.

== The An Heroing Spreads to [[England]] ==

[[Image:CameronDM1502 228x342.jpg|thumb|left|Cameron McWilliams was signed to the [[Shota Cat]] fashion label.]]

Eleven-year-old [[CP]] model Cameron McWilliams decided to become [[an hero]] after talking about the Bridgend an heroes and a [[sex change]] to his mother. 

Some say he did it because his [[Xbox]] told him there were no more [[Mudkips]] left in the world. [[Some argue]] that he was just another [[batshit insane]] kid and wanted to be with his hero [[Chris Benoit]].

He has joined the an heroes in the sky, who gave their lives for our [[lulz]].

An Heroes are apparently related to [[Internet Tough Guy]]s.

== Blame to be placed on Funeral For A Friend? ==

According to [[Wikipedia]] the [[emo]] band Funeral For A Friend came from Bridgend. From their 2005 album Hours the band released a single called Roses For The Dead. The video shows an [[emo]] teenager making himself [[an hero]]. As the single was released a year before any of the current spate of suicides began, many believe Funeral For A Friend is to blame.

Another emo band from Bridgend, Bullet for My Valentine (moar liek FAILentine, am i rite? Their singer can't count.) may also be blamed for the an heroes. They have released a song about a friend becoming an hero.
For example:
