The Ring
'''''The Ring''''' was a Japanese [[fact|documentary]] about a constantly wet piece of [[jailbait]] that haunts [[old media]], most commonly known by the cheap (and quite frankly superior) American ripoff of the same name. For reasons which make absolutely no sense if you've seen the movie, people whose old media she haunts tend to die immediately after looking at common ring-like things such as coffee stains and [[goatse|anal sphincters]]. The release of this information has caused many [[USA]]ns to look at their own assholes just to be sure, which caused half of them to [[cripple|break their backs]] and the other half to get their [[aspergers|heads stuck up their asses]]. This is one of the more feasible theories for the origins of the [[Democrat]]ic (or "spineless") and [[Republican]](or "white trash") parties.

''The Ring'' started the long craze of retarded ass movies that are supposed to portray wet and dirty Japanese girls as terrifying. Other crap ass films that follow this shit-minded logic are: ''The Grudge'', ''The Grudge II'', ''HOLY SHIT THERE'S A WET GIRL WITH LONG BLACK HAIR CRAWLING AROUND ON YOUR FLOOR 3'', and [[Hipster Grifter|The Grifter]]. This is all nothing but urban legend of course, as everyone knows that the REAL terror of Japanese girls is a lifetime of clingy, passive-aggressive servitude, a shotgun wedding and, if you live in Tokyo, [[at least 100]] different types of kamikaze ninja crabs.

The {{googlevideo|8316549897043604406|cursed videotape}} has been digitized in the years since the documentary was released and people stopped watching the physical copies. [[Some argue]] that digital copies of the tape do not carry its curse.

==Internets connection==

Interest in the documentary, originally believed to be a hoax, was inspired by the discovery of several web sites with clues about the haunting, including a web site for the Morgan Ranch, where Samara lived as a young girl. At least one site contained scans of newspaper clippings documenting some of the strange occurrences documented in the film, including mass suicide of [[horse]]s at Morgan Ranch. All the sites have disappeared since the American release of the documentary. [[John McCain]] promises to get to the bottom of this.

Because of the unforgettable and clearly factual nature of her story, Samara still comes up for discussion fairly often in places like {{ljcomm|sleepparalysis}}. Believe it or not, one can usually generate [[drama]] in any community with enough [[pussy|pussies]] just by using Samara-themed [[icon]]s or posting pictures of Samara in lewd and come-hither positions.

==Terror's Realm==

A video game entitled ''The Ring: Terror's Realm'' was created for the Sega Dreamcast and became one of its most [[bullshit|popular]] games. Samara's curse takes the form of [[Last Measure|a computer virus]] and forces people to look at [[Goatse]], the ultimate ring. Critics praised the game's [[crap|avant-garde]] nature, citing how it broke away from the survival horror genre by not being scary in the slightest. [[Expert|Professionals]] also appreciated the [[hacker|homages]] to other popular games such as ''[[Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[Silent Hill]]''. Players went nuts over the [[Superman 64|awesome]] controls and commented that they enjoyed the [[Tl;dr|extensive]] plot; the cutscenes were so in-depth that they minimized gameplay, and who ever really wants to PLAY a video game, amirite? The music was universally praised and has spawned quite a few [[AMV|videos]] on [[YouTube|JewTube]], which may be one of the few bad things that came from this game.



==Gay Version==

There exists another version, for all the anally inclined. "The Hole" is about a movie which when viewed, causes the viewer to become gay in 7 days. Hilarity and awkward moments ensue. No homo.
