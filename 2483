[[Image:Duke nukem 3d 06.jpg|thumb|99% of Duke Nukems gameplay. nothing compared to Grand Theft Auto]]
'''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' was released [[at least 100 years ago]], soon after the more popular ''[[Doom]]''. Nearly identical to one another, both games use the same [[old|revolutionary]] game engine. Said engine isn't even 3D ([[moar]] like [[fail|2.5-D]]), so anybody who bought ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was in fact harshly [[rape|ripped off]]. 

==What's the story?==
The people who wrote this [[shit|fine work of literary genius]] deserve a good [[lynching|firm hand shake]], as it really is [[buttsex|great]]. [[Scientology|Aliens invade earth for no reason]] and kidnap [[whore|attractive women]], which is the motivation for the [[tit]]ular Duke ([[Dick]] Newcomb) to shoot some guns and make predictable one-liners that are [[unfunny|about as funny as cancer]]. It should also be noted that one of the game's most satisfying activities is to [[domestic violence|throw money at strippers and subsequently blow them up]].

==More like JEWke Nukem, amirite?==
The difference between ''Duke Nukem'' and ''Doom'' is its small niche of fanboy [[faggots]], who are convinced that Duke is rock cool, and that knowledge of this fact will get them [[AIDS|laid]]. These deluded people are also convinced that the sequel, [[Duke Nukem Forever]], is nearing completion, <s>but it is a well known fact that this statement is a crock of [[shit]], and said sequel was written off as [[old|vaporware]] [[At least 100 years ago|ages ago]]</s>. [[DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS| It now turns out]] that Gearbox, the developers of the game "borderlands" are finishing the coding and bringing it to release. The difference? [[Ugly|borderlands]] made use of the unreal 3 game Engine, whereas DNF uses a bastardised incarnation of the much older unreal 2 engine. With such a famously [[Retarded|talented]] line up of professionals using such cutting-edge resources, one can only begin to contemplate how impressively [[lie|stable, well optimised, and visually attractive the game will be.]]

Like [[Doom]], ''Duke Nukem'' was very popular as a multiplayer game, with [[geek]]s and [[nerd]]s alike playing with one another in LAN groups. Communal actions like these preserve the [[virgin]]ity of these groups.

==Where Is It Now?==
''Duke Nukem 3D'' has aged very badly, more so than its fellow contemporary [[Doom]], when the [[13 year old boy|13 year olds]] grew up and realized that spouting phrases like "Hail to the king" and "Come get some!" do in fact sound very [[gay|silly]] in civilized company.

Plus, everyone knows that by then, [[Quake]] was the place to be.

==Still Harassing Bitches==

A long time ago in a suburb far, far away, war was beginning. The [[Al Gore|internets]] were [[fail|failing]], /b/tards were [[an hero|hanging]] themselves in their basement, and [[your mom|soccer moms]] were using Ventrilo.

[[Videocompiler]] donned the mask of ''Duke Nukem'' and struck [[rape|fiercely]]. [[goatse|Asses]] were blown out, throats were [[tubgirl|shat]] into and steel balls were said to be owned. Finally, a soccer mom who played ''[[LOTR|Lord of the Rings Online]]'' decided to try and [[batshit crazy|reason]] with this guy, failing miserably.

When the dust settled, [[Videocompiler]] uploaded the video [[for great justice]], [[epic win]], and teh [[lulz]]:

==Other Dukes in recent history==
The only other fellow to carry the handle of "Duke" is John Wayne, but he was a [[pussy]] and decided to stay home instead of winning [[World War II]]. It's fair to assume that people who call themselves Dukes, or indeed any title related to a peerage, are [[cock]]s.

==There Is Another Duke!==
Incredibly, there is another [[faggot]] out there who shares Duke's [[fag]]gy name, as well as his incredibly [[homosexual|manly]] hairstyle.

A cartoon was made in the early [[90s]] by a tofu-eating [[hippy]] named [[Satan|Ted Turner]] about a bunch of [[Nazi]] [[niggers]] who summon a blue [[douche]] to fight a bunch of other [[4chan|dickheads]] called Captain Planet. One of the show's many ill-conceived antagonists is named Duke Nukem. This Duke features the same shitty name, body type, haircut, grunty voice and attitude of his video game counterpart.

==''Evil Dead'' Plagiarization==

Duke's one-liners are more than "inspired by" the ''Evil Dead'' movies - they're blatantly stolen from them. [[Bruce Campbell]] (who delivers the lines as Ash in the movies) has been very vocal about the issue. In [http://verbosity.wiw.org/issue7/bruce.html this interview] with Verbosity, Campbell discusses this issue:

'''V:''' Are you familiar with the game ''Duke Nukem 3D''? If so, are you aware of the similarities between its lead character and Ash in the way of mentality and catch phrases? Are you flattered by this sort of "borrowing" of your work?
<br>
'''BC:''' What can I say? Maybe they're just cheese-balls who can't conceive of an original idea and feel compelled to rip off Ash. Imitation is indeed a form of flattery, but paying a guy is an even better form.

An in [http://formen.ign.com/news/11886.html this interview] with [[IGN]] for Men...

'''IGN For Men''': The Duke Nukem videogame character is obviously an homage to you, at least your attitude...<br>
[[Bruce Campbell]]: What?!<br>
'''IGN For Men''': The Duke Nukem character?<br>
[[Bruce Campbell]]: Really?<br>
'''IGN For Men''': I would say so.<br>
[[Bruce Campbell]]: I'm kidding, I'm well aware of Duke Nukem.<br>
'''IGN For Men''': Have you been approached for the movie at all?<br>
[[Bruce Campbell]]: No, and I would say no because of the way they've handled it.<br>
'''IGN For Men''': How have they handled it?<br>
[[Bruce Campbell]]: Well, they're rip-off artists. Let them get their own damn material. It's called hiring a writer. They're blatantly ripping it off and if I was any kind of litigious guy they would've gotten a phone call by now. It's depressing and I think it's wrong. That's why Tachyon: The Fringe will kick little Duke's ass any day.<br>

In addition, Duke's line about "kicking ass and chewing bubble gum" was stolen from John Carpenter's ''[[They Live]]'', a film which dared to [[JEWS DID WTC|tell the truth]].
