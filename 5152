Malfunctiononline
'''Malfunctiononline''' was made by an obviously homosexual kid who had cancer. He often uses this as an excuse for his shitty pre-pubescent voice. Though most of his subscribers knows this is [[bullshit|not true]]. Despite the fact that the first 2 minutes of all his videos are him rambling on about shit no one cares about, he is still a /b/tard and makes decent videos to help his /b/rothers do shit.. Like raid... Even though his channel caters more to the dumb asses of the internets he brought joy to /b/tards everywhere when he released is video on how to get unbanned from [[Stickam]]. This reactivated countless YouTube channels who once posted lulzworthy Stickam videos but got their computer [[b&]].



== Videos for /b/ ==

The creator of the videos has stated he will be making moar videos for /b/ but not directly for /b/... And has also promised he will no longer break rule 1&2. 

== Why People Care ==

For what it's worth; this guy was the original creator of the win site [[lulz.i8]]. He says he no longer likes to raid, but he still does. Mention the name Errk.i8 in most Stickam rooms and you'll probably get banned.
