[[File:Niccolo Machiavelli.jpg|thumb|260px|He looks like the sort of nerd you'd like to beat up in the school toilets doesn't he? Beware, though. This guy is the sort of nerd who'd manage to destroy you without having to [[An hero|wipe himself out]] as well.]]

{{quote|From this arises the question whether it is better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved. It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both: but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.|The most invaluable advice for any young troll or [[IRL]] dictator.}}

'''Niccolo Machiavelli''' is the world's greatest hero (not to be confused with [[An hero|those who commit suicide in a particularly lulzworthy manner]]). He wrote the definitive handbook to how one should take control of the Internet. Every aspiring totalitarian and wannabe troll should read of his methods.
 

==The Man==
Let's face it, you didn't come to ED to read about an old Italian who died [[At least 100 years ago|over 400 years ago]]. You came here to pretend that you're net-savvy and fap off to [[Tits|this]]. How proud of your life are you, eh? Will you ever feel a woman's touch? Will you ever be loved? Probably not. But you can get tips on both [[OL]] and [[IRL]] blackmail and manipulation from this great man.


==Shit Everybody Cares About==
Machiavelli got into a lot of trouble over various political stuff, and ended up being tortured [[Justin Bieber|in unspeakable ways]]. After this considerable [[Butthurt|embarassment]], he was released and ran away with his family [[Josef Fritzl|where the authorities wouldn't pick on him]]. He then wrote a very famous book based on his life and his experiences of [[Conservative|stabbing people in the back for his own ends]] called ''The Prince'', which is the ultimate guide to how to [[pwn]] your bastard enemies and gain the power that [[Lies|you richly deserve]]. 



==Invaluable Trolling Methods==
[[File:Dictatorships for Dummies.png|thumb|Basically.]]

[[Verbose|First, acquire from any reputable independent literary purveyor a edition of the exquisite tome known as "The Prince"]]. Despite being nearly 500 years old this delightful and highly useful book has been merrily stirring up more shit than Adolf [[Hitler]]'s ''Mein Kampf''.

Although his books were adapted to actual, real-life politics involving murder, bribery and warfare (i.e. shit with consequences) and not online bitchfesting, for the average modern day [[basement dweller]] his rules and methods can easily be applied to the internet, allowing [[you]] to become the most badass [[troll]] on the web - at least in your mind.

===On Rivals:===

*There is no middle ground. Either be preparded to suck dick like a drunk freshman college girl or lead them to [[epic]] ruin.
*When leading rivals to [[epic]] ruin there are no half-measures. Once started you must destroy everything they own and care about. Doing  half-assed job leaves them just angry enough to think about [[lolsuit|taking revenge]].
*Your [[Divide by zero|rival's rivals]] are not your friends. Like fat geeky tech kids, they are for your amusement alone. If your rivals are as weak as American beer, you do not let them gain further power. This, for example, is why you pay fat geeky tech kids in chocolate bars for their favours. They will only grow fatter, ensuring they have no chance of being more popular than you. However, if your rival's rivals are strong, you must get your weaker rivals to destroy them under the pretext of friendship. This has the advantage of weakening both. To use another metaphor, it is like sending the aforementioned tech kids in suicide jackets after the local jock.
