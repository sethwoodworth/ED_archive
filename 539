'''Anshe Chung''' ([[powerword]] "Ailin Graef") is the main [[avatar]] on ''[[Second Life]]'' who rose to [[rich and beautiful|fame and fortune]] after [http://www.theage.com.au/news/biztech/anshes-kinky-past-revealed/2007/01/17/1168709794333.html being whored out] by her [[IRL]] husband to other avatars, building up an epic slumlord business inside the game, and eventually becoming [[Paris Hilton|extremely fucking rich]].

==Dong Attack==
In December [[2006]], during a [[serious business]] in-game interview with CNET, Anshe came under attack from the [[dong]] lovers at [[Something Awful]]. Said [[Homosexual|gayboy]]s bombarded her with images of penises and a [[BBQ]]'d macro of her [[IRL]] holding a [[cock]]. 

This caused the interview to be canceled and Anshe and her hubby to throw a [[Cyberrape|shit fit]] and file fake lawsuits and [[DMCA]]'s against anyone posting video or images of the [[lulz]]y event. This included [[IRL]] newspapers that anyone with a first life would know not to fuck with. Accordingly they fucked her right back by writing [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/11/28/8361953/index.htm disparaging revenge stories] which she [[asking for it|100% asked for]].

As this video shows, she was badly [[pwnt]] by giant floppy cocks.
