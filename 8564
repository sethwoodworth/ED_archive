'''[http://www.youtube.com/troyriser Troy Riser]''' is an [[internets]] [[war]] [[hero]] on [[YouTube]]. He started out as just an average [[vlog]]ger, uploading home movies, and talking about whatever he felt like. After being on YT for about a year, he couldn't help but notice the inordinate amount of [[pedo|kid-fiddlers]] there. [[Irish282]], [[UpDownMostly]], [[DynaCatlovesme]], it just went [[time cube|on and on]].

==Specialty==
So now his specialty is [[pedophile]]s, and he pisses them off like [[noone]] else can. Whenever he makes a video, the pedos come out of the woodwork, generating massive amounts of [[butthurt]], and lulzy comments on tap. Here's a small list of just some of the tubers that hate Troy Riser's guts:
===Interesting people===

==Troy initiates the conversation==
{{quote|the Disney Channel attracts pedophiles. Whats your point? I dont evne knwo what to say. Kids cant just hide in a closet because the possibility of pedos being "attracted".|[[Logan Sperman]], [[asking for it]]}}
{{quote|You're his mouthpiece, his thrall, his eager-to-please flunkie. That tinpot cult leader-wannabe dictates your every move. For once in your life, young as you are, make an adult decision and get out of this mess, now and forever.|Troy Riser, on Logan's man-friend [[Irish282]]}}
{{quote|I find it odd, that you do not realise, that the work I am doing is towards the very fact of reducing suffering, as much as is possible, for minors and adults. Please, [[ad hominem]] will only work for so long, then I will get bored.|Nigel Oldfield, convicted pedo discussing his "important work"}}
{{quote|I just got over 1,000 pornographic spam messages from the hacked account of iamachef, asking me to watch a video of a dog having sex with a woman, and to join a group called 'Fuck Irish282'. This clearly shows the level of abuse people are dealing with on YouTube. This should stop, or else YT will be taken to court.|richiepiep threatens with a [[lolsuit]]}}

==A guaranteed shitstorm on every video==
Troy's uncanny ability to piss people off comes through in every video he makes. In this new submission, he tears [[Young Tubers United]] a new asshole, and exposes them as a front for pedophiles. The pedos, of course, are furious. lol.

{{quote|Troy, a "pedophile" and "[[moot|child rapist]]" are not the same thng..One has a sexual deviance, a sickness, to whatever degree caused by whatever reasons. They are attracted to children like a a guy might be attracted to a girl..You are attracted to women, but do you rape them? I mean its like night and day..Its no more accurate to call pedophiles child rapists, than it is for me to call you a woman rapist.. thats absurd.|[[Logan Sperman]], sticking up for downtrodden pedophiles everywhere}}

==BRB [[lolsuit|LOLSUIT]]==
In an effort to silence Troy, the pedos have sent in their point man, [[DynaCatlovesme]]. Dyna's attorney sent Troy this lulzy "cease and desist" letter. Although DynaCat's attorney was more than willing to accept his money, he didn't have the heart to tell him that there's not a court in the land that would be willing to take on the case of '''"YouTube User: DynaCatlovesme VS Troy Riser"'''.

==Teh [[hater]]s==		
You know you're doing something right when a "hater" channel springs up in your honor. The [http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=TruthAboutTroyRiser TruthAboutTroyRiser] channel is the [[pedo]]'s answer to Troy's own channel. Made of [[fail]] and [[AIDS]], it flounders on the outskirts of [[YouTube]] failing to get anywhere near the subscriber base needed to get its message out. A knock-off channel has also been started by the [[Legion of Noway]], called <s>[http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=truthriser truthriser]</s>('''closed'''). With a dismal 2 subscribers, it follows in the same footsteps as its predecessor.
