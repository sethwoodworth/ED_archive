Cool3
'''Cool3''' is a disgraced former Wikipedia sysop who had his account "[[hax0r|compromised]]" by [[MyWikiBiz|Gregory Kohs]]. 

== What Happened ==
In January, the vandal-administrator [[MZMcBride]] gave a list of unguarded [[BLP]]s to his fuck buddy [[Thekosher]] to vandalize on the [[Wikipedia Review]], not knowing that the Arbcommies were watching. As such, the Arbcommie Roger Davis [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MZMcBride&oldid=342970686#Vandalizing_BLPs forced] MZMcBride to fork over the list he supplied. A checkuser was run on the sockpuppet accounts Thekosher used to vandalize, and it was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArbitration_Committee%2FNoticeboard&action=historysubmit&diff=337900318&oldid=337591797 found] that [[LOL|'''one of his sockpuppets was a sysop account''']]. The account was immediately desysopped. [[win|MZMcBride was also sued in arbcom and had his admin rights revoked]].

== Fallout ==
In an attempt to improve its [[BLP]] situation, Wikipedia only manages to delete two of its own sysops. Well done!

Eventually, the original Cool3 user returned under [[Parody account|User:Cool three]] to request his sysop rights back. The angsty fags, however argued that he [[Profit|sold his own account]]. As a result, he [[Wikicide|stormed off]] in a [[BAWWW|butthurt rage]].

===Quotes===
Cool3 reveals the truth about Wikipedia (from his [[wikipedia:User:Cool three|user page]]):

{{tinyquote|[[13-year-old boy|power-hungry teenagers]] without the social skills to survive in the real world spend their days posting on ANI in activity that reasonable [[men]] would consider either trolling or insanity. These [[Basement dweller|socially-deficient people]] are the ones who rise up through the wiki-hierarchy to enjoy the trust and confidence of the [[Wikipedo|Wikipedia community]].|Cool3}}
{{tinyquote|[[BAWWW|In my time on Wikipedia, I gave thousands of hours my time. I spent considerable sums of money to buy books and magazines I needed to write articles. I gave generously of my time and resources to help others with their articles. I once even drove 3 hours to find an obscure book in a library in order to help someone else]]. In the end, this makes me the [[loser|true fool]].|Why [[you]] should not contribute to Wikipedia}}
{{tinyquote|Reads like the typical screed I've seen since my BBS days: "You didn't <strike>make me a moderator</strike>give me an admin bit! That means you're all power-hungry bastards! You'll be sorry I left!" As long as he's not making personal attacks, I'd say leave it so people can see they were right to vote no in his RfA.|2=[[Internet Tough Guy|HandThatFeeds]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=343142297] Yeah! Way to show him!}}
