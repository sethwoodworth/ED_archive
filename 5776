Nihil
{{crapstub}}
The ''nihil'' is commonly called the ''[[stalker|creeping]] nihil'', but the adjective "creeping" is redundant as it is in the nature of all nihils to creep. Perhaps the better colloquialism is ''nihil creeper''. However, this might be taken to imply that the nihil is a plant, a concept that botanists prefer but zoologists deride. In fact, biologists and philosophers continue to argue whether the nihil is an animal, a plant or an abstract entity, for it has characteristics of all three.

The nihil creeper prefers the cold, sterile, northern winter. They are said to be growing in popularity as family pets in and around Bismarck, ND, where albino nihils are highly prized and celebrated for their spooky pink eyes. However, taking a nihil as a [[Furry|pet]] can be a risky prospect. If allowed to grow unhindered, the nihil will cover windows and require beating back with a shovel. This can prove very expensive when one considers the cost of glazing these days.

However, there is much more to the nihil than merely its household habits. It has been said that the nihil is not something to be taken lightly. Growing upon or just beneath the surface, the nihil sends out rootlets from the stem, such as ivy and couch. In this way, it creeps into our words, into our beliefs, into our very souls. It is present because it is ultimately inescapable.

Above all, the nihil must be treated with respect and caution, for it is rejection of all we hold dear. 
''"Do you feel it? Do you fear it? It drags at our feet. It pulls at our hair. It tugs and lulls our minds. It wants us. It wants to claim us. We must allow it."'' --Nihilo 01-15-2002 12:28 AM
