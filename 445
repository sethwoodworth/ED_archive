Ancestry.com
[http://www.ancestry.com/ Ancestry.com] is a half-assed website, dedicated to helping [[retards]] find out more about their family. Usually found on [[TV|commercials]] or Google ADs, Ancestry.com will let you look into historic files of all around the world to see how pathetic your family ''REALLY'' is. ([[bullshit|As long as you're doing it for 3 months/a year and have 24.95$, of course]].)
Not only does this [[shit]] let you find out more about your family, but you can share your family tree with others. Thats right, Old Barbra will get the publicity she deserves. So, basically, this site is [[Jews|stealing your money to give you information]] while also letting you put pictures and info of your family on your minuscule [[cock|tree]] so your friends (if [[you]] have any) can see [[your mom]] having sex with [[OJ Simpson]] in an attempt to make it a new social-networking site. <br>

==History==
At first, Ancestry.com was a book publisher that started around 1983, taking on the name "[[Obvious|Ancestry Publishing Company]]". At the time, the company published books about [[shit nobody cares about|families]], [[shit nobody cares about|books looking at your families family ]], [[shit nobody cares about|books talking about how to learn more about your family]], and other [[shit nobody cares about| SHIT NOBODY CARES ABOUT]]. Later in 1995, APC decided that it would be a cool idea to make a website called Ancestry.com. A year after, they ejaculated this rotten seed into the slutty-vagina we know as [[the internet]]. In 1999, [[Bill Gates|they (obviously) stole shit from Apple]] to create the first software to allow different users to contribute to one family tree [[evar]]. Ancestry then added more and more [[pix]] to their website to make is seem less shitty. A year after starting their quest for a less dull website, they achieved adding their [[over 9000|1 billionth]] picture to the site. Since then, they have been adding expansions of their site for different parts of the net. (2002 for [http://ancestry.co.uk/ Brits], and 2006 for [http://ancestry.co.ca/ Canadians] and [http://ancestry.co.au/ Australians].)
==Subscription==
To actually find any information about where your family came from, you'll have to fork over some [[cash|moolah]], otherwise you'll be stuck with adding pictures and information on your family that nobody will ever read. '''Ever'''.

After an initial [[drugs|free trial]] period of two weeks in which all the advantages of a paid subscription (like access to [[dox]] and such from census and immigration records) are available to you in the hope that'll you'll get hopelessly addicted to building your family tree, Ancestry.com will automatically start billing the credit card you plunked down upon registration. 

This kind of sneaky [[Jew Gold]]-grubbing chicanery is not unique to Ancestry.com but is especially dangerous considering the addictive nature of the site and the fact that [[NORPS|people]] are generally too lazy to check their credit card statements every month much less get tied up on the phone all day in automated dialling system hell and jump through the seemingly endless hoops of fire necessary to opting out and getting a credit for the chunk of change they just billed you for behind your back.

These subscriptions come at a modest price of $350 a year (If you plan on only learning about your family's history in other countries. But who would want to learn about [[drugs|what their parents did in America?]])
