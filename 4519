Kazaa
[[Image:Kazaa.png|200px|right]]
Popular hangout for [[pedophiles]], [[Korea|Koreans]], and the [[RIAA]], '''[[altcaps|KaZaA]]''' is a great place to download [[CP]], [[virii]], and 25-minute [[mp3|mp3s]] of static [[trap|disguised as legitimate music]]. Quite easily described as the [[ghetto]] of [[P2P]] networks, it was invented by [[communism|Soviets]] [[last thursday]] around the same time as [[Morpheus]] after the first death of [[Napster]].

KaZaA generated some [[drama]] after someone stripped the program of its [[spyware]] and called it KaZaA ''Lite''.

[[Noone]] uses it anymore unless they are [[lag|lagging]] in which case they should turn off kazaa.
