Wikitheft
'''Wikitheft''' is a form of [[Wikipedia Policies and Guidelines|wikicrime]] in which good text is deliberately removed from an article and replaced by a slightly worse version. It is a covert version of [[vandalism]] and can go undetected in many cases. Examples follow.

'''Before Wikitheft:'''
Encyclopedia Dramatica's purpose is to provide a central catalog for the e-public to view organized reference pages about [[drama]], [[memes]], [[e-pals]] and other interesting happenings on the [[internets]]. 

'''After Wikitheft:'''
Encycklopediadramatiica is an encyclonepedia of [[lulz]] on [[teh internets]].

==Committing Wikitheft==
Wikitheft is relatively easy on a large [[wiki]] like [[Wikipedia]], because there are so many [[Vandalism|edits]] that [[Wikipedia#Recent Changes Patrolling (RC Patrolling)|recent change patrollers]] can't easily notice it. [[Wikipedia]] is thus an excellent choice for [[trolls|wikithieves]]. However, [[attention whores]] still seem to prefer the delete-everything form of vandalism in the hope of someday becoming an [[internet celebrity]] like [[Willy on Wheels]]. In this case they will [[fail]] because Willy on Wheels is actually renowned for moving pages and not [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|blanking]] them repeatedly like a retard. Wikitheft is also a great way for [[fake editor]]s like [[Sceptre]] to become sysops.
