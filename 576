This extremely forced meme originated from the Craption Contest, a caption contest on little-known website [http://pointlesswasteoftime.com/new_captions/archive.php?action=2&contest_id=206 Pointless Waste of Time], where it featured the quote "how does a polar bear know what apples is." The [[/b/tard]] who originally posted the image added the caption; "im gonna post this everyday till you like this". Soon after, the meme effect came into play, where people would shop images with the text; "how does a polar bear know what apples is?!". 

It's also been shooped into other memes. For example, it was colorised a few times in a [[Za Warudo]] fashion. Another meme, the "Is it can it be hugs tiem now plees" cat meme, replaced the cat with a polar bear plushie and the text "Is it can it be apples tiem now plees".

The meme itself opens to a number of questions. Why are the apples in ice cubes? What kind of [[sick fuck]] would be capable of such a cruel abomination?? Why is the polar bear trying to get them?! Does the polar bear understand thermodynamics?!? ''HOW DOES A POLAR BEAR KNOW WHAT APPLES IS?!?!''

Upon hearing of [[/b/]]'s usage of the apple bear as a meme and the realization that this horrible quote won the caption contest instead of other captions that were more deserving, if by no means themselves deserving, a [[butthurt]] moderator of the site deleted it, cementing the site's status as being a pool of internet [[faggotry]].


==Oh Noes!!!==


The [[/b/tard]] who posted Apples Bear unintentionally started a spin-off [[meme]]: the "im gonna post this everyday till you like this" meme, as demonstrated here.
