==Title, Lulz Turtle Killing Cox The Fox==

[[Image:Lulz_turtle_kills_cox.jpg]]

My idea for the header of the front page. I'd go into the details of why it should be like this, but [[nobody|who cares about that?]]

:Seems perfect. If anything this site needs, is more furry deaths, and more lulz. [[User:Rembrant|Rembrant]] 11:48, 13 June 2007 (CDT)
::This ''is'' perfect - because it exposes the [[fursecution]] committed here every day, and portends our [[Manifest Destiny|inevitable victory]] over the forces of lulz. The cost may be high, but we shall prevail! [[User:GreenReaper|GreenReaper]] 19:45, 13 June 2007 (CDT)

==This one may be amusing yet functional, or not==

I think having the categories shown on the main page makes it easier to jump in and wander around aimlessly. Can I have extra blow, instead of hookers? --[[User:Chankachankaboo|Chankachankaboo]] 09:20, 11 June 2007 (CDT)


==Idea From Hell==

How 'bout just a blank white screen that occasionally flashes links to other pats of the site? That's lulzy. Sorta.

--[[User:Kagemaru026|Kagemaru026]] 11:48, 11 June 2007 (CDT)

That's one of the shittiest ideas I've ever heard of. --[[User:Cockholster|Cockholster]] 18:24, 12 January 2008 (CST)

== Active/Ongoing Drama ==
There should be a box somewhere on the front page with a war-esque header banner, with about 5 or so articles that are of the most current active lulz drama/anon campaigns (such as the most recent news even IE: Paris hilton Jailtime, 4chaninvasion,youtube war/ect ect.).

Also a question is since there is a call for a redesign, does that mean that "PICOFTHENOW" "yourubeofthenow", and "TheMOARyouknow" wont be around anymore?--[[User:Jawsome|Jawsome]][[User_talk:Jawsome|<sup><font color="blue" style="text-decoration:blink;"><small>RAWR BITCHES!!</small></font></sup>]] 13:10, 11 June 2007 (CDT)

I like the latest drama idea, maybe we could score an RSS feed or something for the front page? --[[User:Qax the duk|Qax the duk]] 18:24, 11 June 2007 (CDT)

i liek that idea too {{User:Zenophile808/sig}}

== Well ==

It is similar in layout to the old one -- but I like the two column idea, with either PotN or video to the right of the main article. What do people think? [[User:Tfo|<font color="red">K</font>]][[User:Tfo|<font color="orange">E</font>]][[User:Tfo|<font color="yellow">K</font>]][[User:Tfo|<font color="green">E</font>]][[User:Tfo|<font color="blue">K</font>]][[User:Tfo|<font color="indigo">E</font>]]<sub>[[User_talk:Tfo|<span style="text-decoration:blink">Talk to me</span>]]</sub> <sup><span style="position: relative; left: -53px; margin-right: -36px; text-decoration:none;">[[Media:HighlightsFanfic.ogg|Listen to me.]] </span></sup> 20:12, 11 June 2007 (CDT)

-- n00b alert but I think the more it correlates to genuine wikis the more lulz it will receive.. I personally liked the old one but it wasn't updated enough. maybe a youtube or myspace paradoy since everyones into it these days? whatever the outcome we have to bombard the reader with information, like any careless fucking wiki does



== New Tagline? ==

Something like "Your complete guide to internet bullshit" sounds good to me. Any ideas on what would be a good tagline?--[[User:Savvinidis|Savvinidis]] 02:42, 12 June 2007 (CDT)

lol no.--[[User:LulzWorthington|LulzWorthington]] 21:17, 17 April 2008 (GMT)

== Some sandbox shit ==

I've been toying around a bit with a new main page concept, but I haven't really progressed far. [[User:Blu Aardvark/Main Page|this is all I've got right now]]. Basically, a half-done header section. I'll keep toying with it. [[User:Blu Aardvark|Blu Aardvark]] 04:18, 12 June 2007 (CDT)
**kkk. I've pretty much finished with that for now. Some of my design elements could use a little tweaking, and my color scheme looks like tubgirl was aiming at the page, but the basic layout is at least in place. [[User:Blu Aardvark|Blu Aardvark]] 00:48, 13 June 2007 (CDT)

== Meme Charts? ==

I was thinking we could have a memes chart which tracks the use of certain words in the chans, here, etc. Don't know how were supposed to do that tho >.> [[User:ScottishDuckHunter|ScottishDuckHunter]] 18:05, 12 June 2007 (GMT)

==Sketchy sketch sketch Sketchy==

'''ok some notes

1. yes its just a sketch - and a rough one
2. yes the main article is shrunk i know its not accurate. this is only a test
but i kinda didn't like how how Article of the Now became small and smaller
and think the ED prontage should be newspaper - like... (?)
3. i always thought that the youtube of the now was too big
and it would be cool to have embeds for LiveVideo and Google
and be able to pass parameters for video size (leik on thumbs)
4.  ok it sucks but whatever..... ''' will do moar ... :)

*I like this -- I think the feeling is that the video of teh nao is FUCKIN HUEG, and if it is that size, we cannot has it.

** i get your point about if the video is small you can't use it, but the logic i used was that people can click it - and if they llike what they see and want to see it full size - they can clcik on the video and view it on youtube (??) {{User:Zenophile808/sig}}

== Header concept ==

I haven't progressed very far with my main page redesign yet, but I've finished a header for it, finally. Comments and suggestions are welcome. [[User:Blu Aardvark|Blu Aardvark]] 14:39, 12 June 2007 (CDT)
